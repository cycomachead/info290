overall
every
time
i
take
a
sip
of
this
my
eyes
gently
pop
out
of
my
head
i
blink
slowly
twice
and
i
smile
its
that
good
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
try
this
bock
its
amazing
as
good
as
best
gets
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
wonderful
malty
flavors
of
a
traditional
bock
come
through
in
this
beer
the
nose
gives
those
slight
chocolate
undertones
which
come
though
when
you
have
a
couple
sips
i
love
it
with
a
dark
chocolate
candy
bar
to
inhance
the
chocolate
flavors
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
smaller
tan
head
good
amount
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
perfect
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
coffee
toffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
even
better
all
the
above
flavors
come
through
and
blend
together
nicely
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
very
pleasant
for
sure
overall
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
millstream
i
had
it
several
years
ago
but
did
not
review
im
not
usually
a
bock
guy
but
this
isnt
a
typical
bock
its
more
like
a
porter
or
brown
ale
with
good
roasted
malt
flavors
overall
a
pretty
good
bock
but
it
has
a
bit
too
much
of
a
roast
for
me
it
is
also
a
bit
sweet
o
darker
beer
with
good
flavor
but
not
overpowering
would
buy
again
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
this
beer
has
made
my
day
too
bad
it
is
my
last
one
as
i
gave
some
away
and
drank
a
few
when
i
had
drank
a
few
too
many
so
i
didnt
realize
its
sheer
awesomeness
an
amazing
amount
of
flavours
and
nuance
for
a
smaller
beer
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
to
make
this
foam
up
on
the
palate
creating
a
smooth
and
pillowy
mouthfeel
seems
about
right
for
a
bock
closes
out
with
a
dry
finish
o
a
very
delicious
beer
that
has
a
good
mouthfeel
far
and
away
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
millstream
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
id
be
proud
of
it
if
i
made
it
but
its
not
amazing
and
doubt
it
will
be
memorable
o
i
am
liking
this
a
lot
great
flavors
and
hits
the
spot
on
a
cold
day
millstream
really
knows
how
to
do
the
german
styles
and
this
is
no
exception
worth
seeking
out
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
porter
or
stout
than
a
bock
this
really
needs
to
be
sweetened
up
m
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
with
an
excellent
level
of
carbonation
very
balanced
beer
with
a
somewhat
sticky
and
sugary
residual
feel
great
winter
beer
verdict
decent
and
flavorful
its
unique
and
worth
trying
if
its
priced
well
m
too
flat
while
the
beer
isnt
fresh
the
bottle
should
hold
carbonation
better
than
this
nothing
else
is
wrong
with
it
d
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
dare
i
say
sessionable
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
millstream
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
in
the
least
certainly
worth
a
try
this
beer
looks
like
a
damn
good
bock
its
got
a
beautiful
deep
amber
color
with
a
beige
head
on
the
surface
the
smell
leaves
much
to
the
imagination
as
it
doesnt
follow
the
color
in
quality
the
aroma
consists
mainly
of
woodsy
notes
and
light
malt
tones
the
overall
nose
isnt
very
strong
the
flavor
has
a
very
woodsy
taste
it
tastes
identical
to
a
homebrew
that
my
friends
and
i
made
that
was
a
failed
attempt
at
a
regular
stout
we
did
use
ringwood
ale
and
i
am
certain
this
is
responsible
for
the
similarities
in
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
on
the
acrid
side
due
to
the
woodsy
taste
there
should
be
chocolate
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
schokolade
german
for
chocolate
but
i
sure
as
heck
dont
taste
it
this
still
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
as
i
thought
my
stout
was
a
failure
i
think
the
same
of
this
beer
its
pretty
good
but
nothing
special
in
the
slightest
this
is
solid
bock
im
very
impressed
with
the
overall
drinkability
and
am
glad
i
nabbed
a
sixer
thanks
bry
this
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
and
is
translucent
only
around
the
edges
it
has
a
quarterinch
of
very
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
dark
cocoa
and
coffee
the
taste
is
deep
rich
dark
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
big
but
the
beer
drinks
light
and
is
much
more
dry
than
sweet
this
beer
is
a
delight
d
an
interesting
bock
i
felt
the
chocolate
malt
flavors
overwhelmed
the
lovely
traditional
bock
flavors
it
was
a
solid
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
when
looking
for
a
bock
i
would
drink
it
again
but
prefer
a
traditional
bock
with
traditional
flavors
d
this
beer
was
very
good
the
abv
makes
this
a
all
night
drinker
a
nice
surprise
from
this
brewery
i
would
look
out
for
this
one
if
you
can
notes
enjoyable
beer
plenty
of
cocoa
and
bakers
chocolate
as
well
as
nuttiness
neither
overly
sweet
nor
bitter
rather
a
nice
balance
enjoyable
chocolate
lager
although
it
is
not
amazing
nice
winter
brew
worth
a
try
tastes
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
hefty
dose
of
bittersweet
toffee
and
butterscotch
candy
hops
add
notes
of
grass
and
peppery
spice
schokolade
sits
well
on
the
tonguemedium
body
with
a
creamy
wellcarbonated
body
and
a
lasting
semibitter
finish
an
impressive
bock
and
easily
one
of
the
better
americanbrewed
versions
of
the
style
ive
encountered
give
this
one
a
try
beer
is
medium
body
pretty
good
for
a
single
bock
some
roast
in
the
back
ever
so
slight
and
sweetness
up
front
nice
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
the
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
cherries
the
flavor
is
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
possibly
some
coffee
mixed
in
to
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
good
example
of
bock
that
isnt
overwhelming
flavorful
and
a
good
session
bock
overall
a
wellrounded
beer
that
is
sort
of
like
the
bock
version
of
southern
tiers
choklat
nothing
too
memorable
and
wish
it
had
a
little
more
to
it
but
then
again
everyone
needs
a
good
6pack
beer
pours
a
lovely
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
nice
finger
of
ecru
head
that
doesnt
really
lace
much
at
all
the
smell
is
heavy
on
the
syrup
molasses
and
chocolate
with
some
slight
plum
and
fig
hints
poking
through
the
haze
as
well
the
taste
is
of
darker
malts
and
more
of
a
cocoa
than
a
chocolate
flavore
a
fine
combination
of
chocolatiness
and
bockiness
the
body
is
a
light
medium
and
runs
velvety
smooth
over
the
tongue
allowing
this
brew
to
be
drunk
and
enjoyed
for
many
an
hour
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
and
one
of
the
more
drinkable
bocks
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
drinkability
another
great
brew
from
millstream
schokolade
bock
melds
the
best
qualities
of
stout
brown
ale
and
amber
ale
and
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
drink
still
a
decent
beer
not
my
favortie
from
millstream
best
of
luck
in
your
findings
cheers
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
light
feel
with
the
great
flavor
make
the
experience
nearly
effortless
it
took
me
two
bottles
just
to
finish
this
review
i
definitely
felt
the
desire
to
move
on
to
something
else
after
finishing
this
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
it
had
some
interesting
aromas
and
look
but
for
a
chocolate
bock
i
really
didnt
get
much
chocolate
character
the
final
few
sips
there
was
a
strong
hint
of
chocolate
but
throughout
it
wasnt
noticeable
still
a
fun
beer
to
drink
overall
a
rather
damn
good
call
its
not
a
big
beer
but
the
subtleties
are
nuts
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
sharp
due
to
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
its
a
little
biting
great
chocolate
flavors
mixed
with
a
warm
breadiness
lots
of
sweet
maltiness
in
this
one
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
nothing
harsh
about
this
at
all
very
high
drinkability
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
for
sure
deasy
drinking
for
sure
definitely
sessionable
but
there
is
nothing
at
all
that
stands
out
with
this
beer
im
going
to
go
out
to
millstream
one
of
these
days
and
hopefully
sample
this
fresh
from
the
tap
and
hope
it
is
a
little
better
but
this
one
didnt
impress
me
at
all
nor
did
it
turn
me
away
interesting
concept
that
leaves
an
incredibly
cocoay
flavor
in
the
mouth
but
ill
pass
on
another
a
very
good
brew
which
i
could
drink
many
of
solid
choice
overall
in
the
bock
category
thanks
buckeyenation
for
the
opportunity
taste
starts
out
quite
dry
and
chalky
with
cocoa
strong
fizzy
carbonation
is
a
bit
of
a
distraction
but
once
that
is
over
it
becomes
creamier
with
some
nice
roasted
malt
and
more
cocoa
slight
bitterness
from
the
chocolate
pretty
interesting
bock
smooth
full
mouthfeel
despite
somewhat
aggressive
carbonation
impressively
simple
pours
a
transluscent
dark
brownish
maroon
color
with
a
medium
fizzy
tan
head
smell
is
dusty
cocoa
with
chocolate
malt
taste
is
similar
with
a
slightly
thin
body
and
dusty
cocoachoclate
flavor
pretty
drinkable
with
medium
carbonation
and
not
bad
at
all
friendly
easy
drinking
but
simple
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
to
take
in
which
stays
mostly
towards
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
dark
color
and
thickness
are
surprisingly
pleasant
the
aroma
is
slightly
chocolately
i
would
say
its
a
good
dessert
beer
d
this
is
a
real
bock
full
of
flavor
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
its
light
body
low
abv
and
pleasant
flavor
make
it
a
great
candidate
for
a
session
brew
d
pretty
sweet
reminds
me
of
the
black
diamond
bock
from
saranac
which
i
was
also
a
fan
of
i
grabbed
this
at
the
sterling
sun
singer
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
quickly
dissipating
finger
of
tan
froth
that
leaves
no
trace
of
its
existence
the
nose
improves
as
the
beer
warms
emitting
chocolate
caramel
and
coffee
malts
the
carry
through
into
the
taste
very
well
better
carbonation
would
assist
schokolade
bock
for
this
flattens
rather
quickly
yet
on
the
whole
this
is
pretty
good
bock
flavorful
and
smooth
not
top
of
the
line
but
worth
grabbing
and
enjoying
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
bock
great
appearance
and
a
good
taste
drinkability
an
excellent
bock
that
i
was
quite
surprised
to
encounter
this
was
brought
back
from
iowa
by
a
friend
and
i
had
left
it
in
my
fridge
for
a
couple
of
months
i
will
get
more
if
i
can
find
it
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
no
head
retention
and
no
lacing
smell
is
pretty
nice
some
caramel
dark
fruit
and
some
cocoa
powder
taste
is
fairly
sweet
with
a
chocolatey
finish
maybe
some
caramel
in
there
too
high
side
of
medium
carbonation
with
heavier
than
medium
body
i
could
probably
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
pretty
good
beer
finish
was
a
nice
long
sweet
and
warming
i
enjoyed
this
even
in
the
dead
of
summer
though
i
can
see
how
it
would
be
more
enjoyable
next
to
a
fire
as
a
true
winter
warmer
just
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
dry
finishing
i
could
go
for
a
sixer
in
the
fall
whilst
sitting
my
arse
on
the
deck
watching
the
leaves
fall
d
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
im
a
fan
of
the
bock
and
a
chocolateschokolade
one
sounded
intriguing
simply
found
this
one
too
quirky
on
the
tongue
too
sticky
in
the
mouth
too
gassy
in
the
gut
i
finished
but
not
by
much
i
believe
this
beer
was
still
fresh
enough
but
just
was
not
the
right
beer
for
my
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
for
my
liking
a
little
watery
the
body
is
somewhat
disappointing
so
more
than
one
of
these
probably
wouldnt
happen
with
me
if
that
was
less
watery
it
would
really
improve

bock
the
head

is
good
and
it
leaves
craggy
walls
of
lace
in
its
wake
the
nose
is
subtly
roasty
and
darkly
chocolateish
the
flavor
however
is
fuller
its
gently
bready

with
a
caramelish
side
and
there
actually
is
some
schokolade
to
this
beauty
its
not
rich
or
full
but
it
does
lean
towards
maltiness
and
as
it
warms
it
tends
to
express
a
fuller
character
theres
some
nuttiness
and
the
bitterness
is
reminiscent
of
walnut
skins
its
clean
and
it

dry

passing

the

step
aside
and
allow
you
to
really

with
a

some

a

roasted

flavor
and
bitter
nutty
aftertaste
a
bit
thin
oily
for
my
taste
but
its
got
pretty

certainly
an

with

come

i
just
found
a
bottle
of
one
of
these
in
my
six
pack
of
warsh
pail
ale
so
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
proper
review
instead
of
my
tap
room
sampler
looks
like
a
proper
bock
very
dark
and
caramelish
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
grainy
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
mocha
tastes
a
bit
chocolatey
as
well
as
sweet
and
malty
very
good
almost
tasted
like
a
brown
ale
to
me
without
being
out
of
the
bock
style
mouthfeel
was
perfect
but
for
some
reason
i
couldnt
find
myself
drinking
this
in
a
session
even
though
the
abv
is
about
within
range
uncomplicated
easy
going
and
quickdrinking
not
to
mention
a
nice
little
traditional
spin
on
the
bock
style
this
beer
is
not
drinkable
i
dont
know
if
i
can
find
another
one
and
try
it
later
taste
begins
fruity
cherries
and
dates
then
gets
a
little
bitter
and
gritty
roastynutty
and
it
ends
about
there
mouthfeel
is
medium
finish
is
brief
and
still
chocolatey
a
bit
fizzy
and
a
bit
more
bland
sorry
to
say
its
not
bad
at
all
just
lacking
what
wed
really
like
from
a
bock
flavor
just
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
could
be
a
lot
tastier
more
rich
full
maltiness
is
in
order
taste
okay
this
is
a
bock
dang
ive
never
had
that
caramelly
bock
mixed
with
chocolate
before
thats
kinda
interesting
in
the
end
the
chocolate
dominates
after
the
chocolate
i
get
some
rebounds
of
chocolate
but
nothing
new
to
really
captivate
my
interest
medium
bodied
bordering
on
mediumthick
with
some
sharp
carbonation
on
the
tongue
piercing
home
boy
i
wish
there
was
more
to
this
beer
its
got
the
sweet
to
carry
things
along
but
all
i
get
is
chocolate
and
a
distant
caramel
one
dimensional
which
could
make
for
a
good
session
beer
but
its
just
too
sweet
for
that
id
love
to
support
the
home
team
but
i
just
cant
do
it
taste
is
soapysweet
rummy
malt
light
roasted
flavors
mingle
paving
the
way
for
some
spicy
hops
that
gradually
come
in
resulting
in
a
meatyhomebrew
bitterness
that
lasts
long
into
the
finish
mediumbodied
not
cloying
or
too
thick
not
bad
but
this
doesnt
do
a
lot
for
me
thanks
to
buckeyenation
for
the
trade
this
bock
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
light
tan
head
thin
and
spidery
lacing
the
aroma
is
lightly
malty
with
chocolate
undertones
mediumbodied
and
very
sweet
with
chocolate
malt
caramel
and
nut
flavors
some
smoke
can
be
detected
at
times
too
the
finish
is
lightly
sweet
and
not
very
interesting
or
flavorful
but
luckily
it
doesnt
detract
too
much
from
the
experience
all
in
all
a
fair
bock
thanks
to
mentor
for
sending
me
a
brigade
of
iowa
brews
backwash
another
beer
that
makes
me
wonder
why
iowans
would
ever
buy
a
macro
beer
millstream
beers
remind
me
a
bit
of
ithaca
brewings
offerings
except
for
the
bigger
ithaca
beers
they
are
generally
well
done
but
lack
some
flavor
and
body
concentration
allaround
a
fine
effort
smooth
malt
driven
joy
nice
mix
of
chocolate
coffee
with
a
slight
plum
flavour
that
keeps
me
on
my
toes
finishes
with
a
slight
metallic
twang
no
significant
hop
flavours
medium
full
bodied
weak
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
because
i
live
in
a
state
that
has
only
one
brewery
id
like
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
enjoy
the
hell
out
of
their
beer
drink
local
and
all
that
schokolade
bock
doesnt
do
much
for
me
though
id
like
to
think
that
its
a
couple
of
fixes
away
from
being
good
so
ill
keep
trying
it
year
after
year
and
hope
that
some
changes
are
made
for
now
though
i
think
ill
stick
with
a
few
of
millstreams
other
offerings
the
beer
as
it
extravasates
the
bottle
is
a
deep
limpid
sanguineous
color
with
the
head
bunyanesque
in
size
spumescent
in
texture
and
a
beauteous
light
tan
color
the
lace
forms
a
silky
skirt
to
surround
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
chocolate
caramel
slightly
earthy
crisp
and
clean
to
the
senses
start
is
a
bit
tart
with
a
sweet
malt
background
the
top
is
fair
to
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
delightful
acidity
the
hops
personable
in
their
spicy
presence
somewhat
vinous
aftertaste
that
is
also
quite
dry
an
interesting
beer
and
i
was
given
this
beer
quite
some
time
ago
by
belgiumbum
and
i
thank
him
for
a
chance
to
sample
this
most
unique
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
head
that
goes
away
quickly
leaving
a
thin
rim
of
lace
around
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
mellow
malt
and
chocolate
taste
is
very
nice
nice
dark
chocolate
and
malt
bitterness
the
bitterness
is
finely
balanced
with
malt
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
are
a
little
dry
that
is
fine
this
is
an
excellent
bock
notes
perhaps
one
of
the
best
bocks
i
have
has
to
date
the
taste
is
flawless
and
it
is
so
drinkable
a
prime
example
of
the
style
overall
a
decent
bock
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
to
see
if
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
or
not
however
given
this
beers
scarcity
thats
not
likely
big
thanks
to
aksmokedporter
for
this

obtain
iowa
beer
reddish

medium

aroma
is

a
medium
bodied
bock
malts
are

and
sweet
hops
are
slightly
spicy
there
is
a
residual
sournesstartness
that
sort
of
dominates
everything
else
in
this
beer
the
finish
is
surprisingly
dry
the
dryness
and
the
unexpected
sourness
is
it
supposed
to
be
there
or
is
the
beer
infected
make
this
an
interesting
and
very
different
bock
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
and
a
little
sour
this
beer
is
a
almostblack
colored
brew
with
dark
brown
tones
showing
through
the
light
small
brown
head
that
takes
off
quick
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
chocolate
the
first
thing
that
hits
my
tounge
in
this
brew
is
a
strong
nug
taste
im
not
a
big
nut
fan
so
i
cant
tell
you
what
kind
but
thats
about
half
the
taste
the
other
tastes
are
hints
of
chocolate
but
for
me
this
is
dominated
by
nuts
that
said
i
think
its
a
fairly
tasty
beer
like
the
other
offerings
from
millstream
i
think
its
uniqueness
is
enough
of
a
reason
for
you
to
try
this
besides
that
its
not
half

guarantee
this
will
not

for

i
bought
this
after
a
weekend
of
hop
burnout
and
what
a
great
purchase
it
turned
out
to
be
dark
lager
mildly
transparent
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
light
lacing
down
the
glass
big
toasted
malty
sweetness
up

with
with
some
spicy
notes
and
minimal
bitterness
on
the
back
end
really
festive
bottle
from
trade
and
my
first
from
penn
pours
dark
brownish
red
somewhat
opaque
with
some
red
shin
fun
through
and
an
off
white
to
khaki

creamy

aroma
screams

a

some

flavor
is
chocolate
covered
prunes
with
some

sweetness
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
in
flavor
but
easy
drinking
with
light
plus
mouthfeel
and
medium
low
carbonation
acceptable
brew
and
worth
trying
m
the
initial
mouthfeel
was
bitter
but
smooth
o
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
without
question
probably
drink
the
whole
thing
in
one
night
pretty
damn
good
germanstyle
brew
lusciouslymoreish
fulfilling
glad
i
finally
came
across
a
bottle
and
it
was
in
philly
youd
think
i
wouldve
crossed
paths
with
one
before
huh
overall
a
very
good
bock
style
beer
great
mouthfeel
and
clean
flavors
create
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
nice
malty
bock
that
stays
traditional
to
the
style
easy
drinking
and
smooth
reminds
me
of
russian
black
bread
great
example
of
bock
style
from
an
american
perspective
i
like
everything
from
penn
and
this
is
no
different
the
consistency
is
the
most
enjoyable
aspect
of
the
winter
beers
wish
that
there
were
more
of
these
in
the
variety
case
a
personal
favorite
for
holiday
ales
i
drink
over
a
dozen
a
year
i
feel
always
available
in
my
area
and
standardly
good
especially
at
my
local
dive
bar
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
head
and
lingering
lacing
slight
nose
of
dark
malt
sweetness
light
medium
body
and
well
carbonated
the
balanced
flavor
of
dark
roast
malt
is
pleasant
and
only
hints
at
sweetness
smooth
crisp
finish
aided
by
the
carbonation
the
roast
malt
is
most
evident
on
the
finish
and
leaves
a
nice
residual
flavor
oa
solid
bock
with
good
flavor
and
easy
drinkability
notes
penn
brewery
has
made
this
beer
better
in
the
past
and
i
have
positively
reviewed
it
maybe
i
had
a
bad
batch
o
certainly
a
good
beer
but
tame
for
style
versus
european
versions
a
bock
leaning
towards
an
amber
o
an
enjoyable
bock
beer
satisfying
taste
and
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
not
too
sweet
or
cloying
an
interesting
bock
decent
flavor
and
some
christmas
spice
to
it
compared
to
other
bocks
ive
had
the
stronger
version
of
this
beer
as
well
and
i
prefer
that
but
this
is
pretty
good
too
and
id
seek
it
out
again
o
a
really
nice
bock
which
is
a
great
alternative
to
spiced
winter
warmers
which
i
hate
penn
knocks
another
german
lager
style
for
at
least
a
triple
if
not
a
homer
having
just
had
the
ayinger
celebrator
a
few
days
ago
its
pretty
hard
not
to
be
a
bit
critical
of
this
beer
while
it
has
decent
flavors
the
beer
is
otherwise
light
simple
and
fairly
one
dimensional
not
sure
this
is
one
i
need
to
try
again
any
time
soon
overall
a
pretty
nice
holiday
brew
not
overly
spiced
and
when
combined
with
its
roast
and
good
level
of
carbonation
and
thickness
made
for
a
good
easily
holiday
drinker
overall
fairly
one
note
more
malt
complexity
would
really
improve
the
experience
somewhat
weak
this
isnt
totally
bad
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
its
easily
on
the
lesser
side
of
average
its
merely
forgettable
this
is
a
fitting
seasonal
offering
that
i
look
forward
to
every
time
christmas
rolls
around
dark
brown
in
color
with
reddish
hues
and
good
clarity
poured
with
a
very
light
brown
creamy
foam
that
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
that
left
creamy
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
great
aroma
lightly
roasted
malt
chocolate
malt
and
nutty
aromas
with
a
hint
of
coffee
at
the
end
creamy
light
delicate
feel
surprisingly
light
bodied
roasted
malt
and
toffee
flavors
up
front
smooth
chocolate
thru
the
middle
light
ripe
fruit
flavors
a
hint
of
burnt
malt
and
a
bit
of
bitter
hoppiness
at
the
finish
lots
of
different
flavors
and
aromas
going
on
this
was
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
1433
get
by
the
smell
and
you
have
a
near
perfect
example
of
an
american
styled
bock
overall
i
could
never
drink
a
whole
6
pack
of
this
stuff
but
one
or
two
on
a
cold
night
does
a
body
good
overall
an
ok
holiday
offering
i
could
certainly
drink
a
six
but
for
the
price
i
think
i
may
pass
none
of
the
flavors
are
overpowering
and
i
think
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
ummph
odoesnt
quite
stand
up
to
the
test
of
time
its
actually
a
great
bock
but
it
seems
to
taste
more
and
more
syrupy
as
i
drink
this
ill
admit
that
ive
ordered
this
several
times
though
its
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
when
options
are
limited
o
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
annually
with
friends
and
family
it
has
become
tradition
in
this
home
for
this
holiday
beer
to
be
around
thanks
to
the
crew
at
the
penn
brewery
for
the
great
beer
o
a
very
solid
offering
from
a
nice
pennsylvania
brewery
will
go
back
to
this
one
anytime
again
prost
quality
bock
overall
a
very
solid
bock
it
doesnt
reinvent
the
wheel
but
it
rolls
just
fine
definitely
hits
the
spot
during
the
holidays
d
a
solid
bock
sampling
from
penn
very
enjoyable
brew
with
clean
aromasflavors
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
in
my
makeshift
holidaywinter
mixsix
overall
a
winter
classic
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
for
a
stronger
bock
overall
a
solid
bock
beer
here
good
blend
of
roasted
malt
and
sugary
fruitness
enjoy
this
one
in
front
of
the
fireplace
and
forget
the
rest
of
the
night
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
i
will
drink
this
all
nigh
but
will
have
to
watch
the
abv
does
not
sneak
up
on
me
this
beer
gives
me
something
to
look
foward
to
every
christmas
season
a
built
in
xmas
gift
for
anyone
looking
to
purchase
something
for
me
this
holiday
season
this
is
a
must
try
for
everybody
you
need
to
try
this
seasonal
christmas
superstar
from
penn
brewery
o
really
enjoyed
this
older
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
from
jlindros
at
his
place
aged
very
well
considering
the
abv
overall
pretty
good
great
aged
soft
malts
nice
dark
fruits
complex
aged
well
really
hits
the
spot
when
looking
for
a
good
doppelbock
style
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
really
smooth
mildly
malty
but
not
overly
sweet
easy
drinking
great
mouthfeel
a
really
wonderful
bock
truly
so
pours
a
clear
tawnybrown
color
with
an
average
creamy
tan
head
with
good
spotty
lacing
as
it
moves
down
the
glass
the
nose
carries
through
some
heavy
malt
character
brown
sugar
caramel
chocolate
molasses
toast
and
a
hint
of
a
nutty
character
come
through
the
flavor
hits
hard
on
the
brown
sugar
and
molasses
plus
some
bread
light
hop
presence
in
the
background
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
and
has
an
average
length
through
the
finish
lit
bitterness
smooth
and
creamy
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
really
a
fantastic
version
of
the
style
thanks
again
vince
o
very
nice
bock
really
easy
to
drink
nice
representation
of
the
style
the
nose
is
rich
bready
and
fruity
rather
like
fruitcake
with
raisins
brown
sugar
toffee
and
vanilla
im
guessing
theres
some
munich
malt
here
its
got
that
intoxicatingly
complex
signature
of
this
malt
with
a
darker
more
caramelized
character
no
hops
are
detected
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
burnt
sugar
a
little
vanilla
and
a
moderate
fruitiness
despite
this
it
doesnt
really
taste
too
sweet
and
my
guess
would
be
that
the
burnt
sugar
bitterness
has
something
to
do
with
it
the
bready
character
i
picked
out
on
the
nose
isnt
really
noticeable
on
the
palate
though
there
is
plenty
of
malt
complexity
brown
sugar
burnt
sugar
caramel
a
little
toffee
and
a
little
butterscotch
too
drying
on
the
finish
with
some
toffee
and
burnt
sugar
bitterness
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
is
rather
excessively
carbonated
for
my
liking
still
this
is
a
great
bock
though
in
many
ways
its
closer
to
a
dopplebock
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
had
some
very
nice
flavors
to
it
and
it
doesnt
hurt
that
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
was
a
great
choice
to
drink
while
watching
some
football
this
afternoon
d
easy
to
drink
im
not
sure
what
my
average
3
is
but
its
closer
to
not
impressed
territory
its
not
something
i
would
pay
for
and
be
excited
about
but
regardless
cheers
edit
as
i
was
rinsing
out
the
bottle
i
noticed
a
crescent
of
white
residue
on
the
bottom
i
dont
know
if
this
had
something
to
do
with
it
not
being
up
to
snuff
but
if
it
did
id
hold
the
brewer
accountable
for
that
cola
brown
with
a
light
beige
head
decent
retention
and
lacing
on
the
sides
very
clear
but
still
opaque
smell
has
notes
of
toffee
and
sweet
roasted
malts
some
banana
tinged
fruity
yeast
esters
a
bit
of
plum
wine
mild
earth
taste
had
toffee
and
brown
bread
fused
into
a
roasted
grain
coffee
sweet
fruity
desserts
with
light
spice
coffee
gets
bigger
toward
the
finish
with
a
faint
sweet
alcohol
flourish
a
bit
of
sourness
bitterness
flows
into
tea
leafiness
and
leaves
a
dry
caramel
graham
with
toasted
biscuits
feel
is
light
and
crisp
with
spot
on
carbonation
super
drinkable
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
but
it
is
so
good
that
anytime
is
a
fine
time
for
this
brew
a
real
winner
and
something
to
seek
out
this
beer
seems
to
be
right
on
the
style
which
i
am
still
acquiring
a
taste
taste
was
pretty
good
not
as
big
in
the
malt
as
i
expected
though
hints
of
burnt
sugar
fruts
but
seemed
to
be
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
bock
a
very
good
christmas
beer
md
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
a
bock
but
everything
else
makes
a
very
good
bock
it
goes
down
way
to
easy
it
is
a
great
thing
that
these
guys
are
up
and
running
agian
overall
though
i
wish
this
was
amped
as
i
felt
the
malts
were
too
muted
i
was
little
let
down
on
this
but
would
have
again
i
definitely
want
to
try
st
niks
cousin
the
reserve
to
do
a
comparison
color
is
very
dark
even
for
a
bock
with
a
dark
but
not
very
carbonated
head
aroma
is
alcoholly
but
thats
kind
of
what
youd
expect
from
a
bock
the
flavor
as
well
had
some
kick
to
it
but
also
very
well
balanced
with
other
flavors
such
as
bread
raisons
and
yeast
the
bar
serves
weaker
beers
in
16
oz
glasses
an
stronger
beers
in
12
oz
somehow
the
st
nik
made
it
into
the
former
category
you
can
get
drunk
quickly
on
sixteen
ounce
glasses
of
this
beer
which
is
very
easy
to
drink
d
i
liked
this
one
over
the
private
reserve
since
it
has
less
body
and
more
taste
great
overall
beer
i
love
this
beer
it
is
unbelievably
smooth
and
rich
with
just
the
right
amount
of
tartness
to
keep
it
from
being
a
chocolate
smoothie
i
love
this
beer
so
much
that
i
find
myself
only
having
1
or
2
at
the
most
when
i
feel
i
am
actually
worthy
of
the
reward
it
is
that
good
trust
me
makes
winter
here
in
ohio
a
little
more
bearable
i
am
not
normaly
a
darker
beer
fan
but
this
is
the
bomb
smooth
with
a
roasted
carmel
sweetness
not
too
sweet
just
right
in
my
book
i
dont
have
many
other
bocks
to
compare
it
with
as
most
ive
tried
i
didnt
much
care
for
this
brew
is
something
special
thanks
to
tom
pastorius
for
bring
the
penn
brewery
back
to
greatness
this
brew
will
make
for
a
great
holiday
season
lol
if
you
enjoy
lagers
that
arent
pussy
beers
try
this
it
just
might
surprise
you
a
tasty
treat
and
a
great
switch
from
the
plethora
of
winter
warmers
not
that
there
are
many
germanstyle
bocks
imported
into
the
us
this
one
stands
out
the
most
with
a
truetostyle
flair
give
this
one
a
go
the
beer
pours
a
medium
orangishbrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
grain
and
other
malts
the
flavor
is
lightly
roasted
malt
some
alcohol
and
some
lighter
toffee
malts
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
a
clean
tasting
lager
but
nothing
really
stands
out
d
a
good
spice
christmas
beer
worth
a
try
my
first
beer
from
penn
brewing
i
actually
bought
this
last
christmas
time
so
its
been
in
my
dark
cool
closet
im
not
sure
if
it
changed
the
taste
any
but
it
was
quite
tasty
had
nice
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
malt
and
slight
hops
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
appearance
not
much
to
the
head
died
out
pretty
quickly
cant
really
tell
theres
7
5
in
it
which
could
make
it
dangerous
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
a
off
white
color
head
that
gives
way
to
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malt
chocolate
malt
and
some
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
with
a
hint
of
some
spice
it
is
a
good
taste
but
it
isnt
as
full
and
bodied
as
some
other
bocks
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
and
the
smell
and
appearance
are
very
inviting
for
santa
claus
to
deliver
presents
to
all
the
children
of
the
world
on
christmas
eve
it
is
estimated
that
his
sleigh
must
travel
at
a
speed
of
2924180
mph
thats
pretty
fast
but
im
not
that
impressed
i
could
probably
finish
off
a
glass
of
the
st
nikolaus
bock
bier
at
an
equivalent
speed
speaking
of
which
this
bottle
did
disappear
awfully
fast
and
a
full
case
of
this
stuff
would
be
a
nice
find
under
the
tree
hint
hint
d
no
not
at
all
this
flavor
sticks
with
me
for
a
while
and
isnt
overpowering
or
biting
very
drinkable
d
flavorful
with
a
good
complexity
to
it
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
d
could
throw
a
few
of
these
back
but
not
too
many
bc
of
the
abv
you
cant
even
begin
to
taste
the
high
abv
this
brew
is
perfect
4
5
d
drinkability
good
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
hued
brown
with
a
decent
creme
head
nose
is
malty
and
leafy
flavor
brings
the
same
consistent
sweet
tone
thats
not
overdone
its
mostly
a
mix
of
the
malts
and
that
deep
sugary
tone
feel
is
low
on
carbonation
and
slick
and
sticky
on
liquid
quite
easy
to
drink
decent
brew
and
easy
drinking
but
not
one
ill
look
for
again
d
pretty
easy
going
down
not
necessarily
my
favorite
style
but
still
pretty
good
single
from
norms
vienna
va
this
holds
its
own
not
just
as
an
exceptional
domestic
version
of
a
style
i
hardly
ever
see
from
us
breweries
but
against
the
top
german
representatives
in
its
class
as
well
worth
seeking
out
d
honestly
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
brew
probably
need
another
to
reach
a
solid
conclusion
theres
a
lot
i
like
but
overall
im
not
sure
im
overly
impressed
d
very
drinkable
and
probably
the
best
bock
iv
ever
had
loads
of
flavor
without
being
watery
or
too
roasty
as
some
bocks
ive
had
according
to
my
notes
the
biggest
difference
from
this
on
tap
over
the
bottle
are
a
slightly
enhanced
taste
and
look
the
head
sticks
around
much
longer
and
while
the
tastes
are
mostly
similar
the
christmas
touch
of
honey
and
other
spices
are
allowed
a
bit
more
room
to
show
off
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
still
great
and
smell
is
unfortunately
still
unremarkable
highly
drinkable
for
a
beer
of
this
abv
i
had
many
on
new
years
eve
and
never
tired
of
them
drinkability
this
is
a
real
good
beer
worth
trying
nice
winter
beer
to
try
on
a
cold
day
lots
of
taste
here
although
it
is
high
in
alcohol
you
cannot
taste
it
great
beer
clap
clap
clap
pours
a
clear
ruby
brown
color
with
a
fairly
small
white
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
faint
i
pick
up
some
munich
malt
and
a
hint
of
red
wine
the
taste
is
of
the
breadydoughy
munich
malt
mineral
water
and
a
nice
lightly
toasted
grain
quite
a
clean
taste
perhaps
some
red
grapes
in
the
end
the
bock
has
a
moderate
body
with
crisp
carbonation
nice
malty
sweetness
very
easy
on
the
palate
a
highly
drinkable
bock
very
clean
and
crisp
nice
malt
flavor
the
7
5abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
good
brew
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
leaves
some
drippy
lace
on
the
glass
malty
bready
aromas
followed
by
some
pale
fruit
and
berries
rich
malty
flavor
sweet
berries
caramel
raisins
clean
and
a
little
sticky
medium
bodied
and
smooth
not
bad
not
the
greatest
bock
in
the
world
though
overall
a
tasty
and
unique
christmas
beer
i
always
liked
the
darker
bock
beers
than
the
lighter
ones
and
this
one
is
a
good
example
of
the
former
recommended
12
oz
bottle
aroma
is
sweet
with
noticible
alcohol
not
pleasant
flavor
is
smooth
with
a
partially
clean
finish
a
little
staleness
in
the
finish
malt
dominates
the
flavor
profile
as
expected
for
the
style
i
just
think
the
finish
can
be
a
little
better
after
the
undesirable
aroma
i
was
expecting
an
bad
experience
but
the
beer
is
actually
quite
drinkable
tastes
initially
of
sweet
chocolate
but
quickly
finishes
with
a
surprisingly
assertive
hop
bitterness
the
hallertau
are
quite
noticeable
and
outweigh
some
of
the
more
interesting
and
complex
flavors
imparted
by
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
provides
a
rich
impact
but
i
would
have
hoped
for
something
a
bit
more
chewy
for
this
style
and
beer
a
little
to
strong
on
the
hops
in
my
eyes
for
the
style
but
its
an
enjoyable
beer
that
would
likely
be
improved
when
paired
with
some
traditional
german
pork
d
despite
a
slightly
higher
abv
i
could
enjoy
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
drinkability
on
this
one
is
absolutely
fantastic
i
can
put
these
back
one
after
the
other
i
had
no
idea
that
this
beer
was
7
5
abv
until
i
went
to
write
this
review
hidden
extremely
well
not
even
a
trace
of
alcohol
d
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
was
able
to
finish
two
pints
of
it
fairly
quickly
and
i
wanted
more
one
i
will
definitely
be
consuming
more
of
this
holiday
season
also
the
7
50
is
completely
unnoticeable
d
nice
winter
beer
the
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
but
the
beer
is
something
that
i
would
order
more
of
at
a
bar
pours
a
very
nice
dark
copper
color
with
some
light
coming
through
with
good
head
and
some
nice
lacing
nice
malty
scent
earthy
but
not
as
deep
and
strong
as
id
like
excellent
taste
very
thick
and
smooth
a
lot
of
malty
goodness
a
real
earthy
flavor
with
some
nice
caramel
finishing
it
goes
down
very
well
for
a
higher
gravity
beer
an
excellent
christmas
bock
it
could
just
be
that
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
it
but
i
could
drink
this
all
winter
a
nice
malty
step
up
from
the
oktoberfests
that
got
me
through
the
past
few
months
the
flavor
has
nicely
caramelized
malts
which
fades
in
sour
cherries
and
a
touch
a
hop
backing
feels
fresh
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
i
guess
ill
have
to
look
for
another
quality
bock
to
try
d
drinkability
does
very
well
despite
the
abv
worth
checking
out
im
going
to
save
one
and
revisit
it
later
d
very
drinkable
but
modestly
limited
by
the
abv
for
quantity
also
slightly
heavy
for
quantity
overall
this
is
one
solid
bock
beer
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
delicious
cheers
a
good
bock
but
sadly
not
a
great
bock
a
little
light
in
my
opinion
md
i
got
this
for
christmas
its
a
great
beer
very
solid
and
delicious
drinkability
nothing
super
but
an
easy
sixer
to
polish
off
pours
a
dark
tea
extremely
light
coffee
color
it
is
extremely
clear
and
a
nice
amount
of
tan
head
soon
descends
into
a
trace
along
the
side
of
the
glass
and
surface
aroma
is
pure
malt
a
good
amount
of
caramel
toasted
bread
pecans
no
roasted
malts
are
detected
and
no
bitterness
along
with
no
hops
a
medium
rich
mouthfeel
fills
my
mouth
with
even
more
complex
malt
flavors
a
nice
creaminess
as
well
from
the
medium
carbonation
i
get
a
little
bit
of
raisin
and
dark
fruit
flavor
coming
from
the
malts
not
esters
along
with
a
slight
floral
spice
from
the
hops
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
keep
it
balanced
finish
is
extremely
clean
with
a
little
sweetness
but
nothing
cloying
overall
my
first
of
this
style
and
though
im
still
a
diehard
hop
head
a
nice
brew
d
all
night
damn
you
pours
a
murky
dark
amber
hue
with
a
one
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
scattered
bubbles
stickiness
is
thin
but
there
smell
has
a
nutty
characteristic
with
a
bit
of
noble
hops
some
dark
fruits
with
a
hint
of
faint
chocolate
malt
and
bready
notes
big
metallic
flavor
up
front
followed
by
a
sweet
nutty
malt
some
lager
yeast
and
a
nice
toasted
caramel
sweetness
light
to
medium
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
carbonation
pretty
shocked
this
one
has
a
7
5
abv
i
really
enjoy
how
this
one
goes
down
i
havent
had
too
many
bocks
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
overall
tasted
good
on
a
very
cold
winters
night
but
really
nothng
spectacular
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
for
the
style
alcohol
is
hidden
d
a
very
smooth
well
crafted
bock
that
has
such
nice
flavors
w
creamy
textures
and
hides
the
abv
well
a
nice
american
bock
w
a
classic
influence
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
very
easy
really
refreshing
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
alcohol
is
not
evident
at
all
a
very
sessionable
bock
beer
i
wish
i
had
another
one
of
these
because
it
would
be
very
easy
to
down
a
couple
of
these
st
nicholaus
bock
bier
pours
a
mahogany
color
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
malty
the
flavor
is
mostly
malty
but
there
is
a
bit
of
sourness
at
times
and
a
bit
of
spice
most
likely
from
the
alcohol
decent
but
didnt
blow
me
away
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
slight
ruby
tone
and
a
little
white
head
smell
is
mostly
dark
fruits
and
breadiness
with
slight
copper
smell
nice
smooth
taste
with
a
bit
of
apple
and
darker
fruits
malts
are
there
and
good
lagery
smooth
finish
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
nice
and
smooth
and
a
fantastic
session
beer
defenitely
wish
i
could
get
this
on
tap
somewhere
to
pound
after
work
the
beer
is
nice
and
clean
but
maybe
thinned
out
a
little
over
past
year
overall
a
solid
beer
though
i
would
buy
it
again
mouth
was
lager
watery
not
much
of
aftertaste
with
a
quick
wash
taste
well
this
was
a
brown
ale
more
than
a
bock
slightly
toasted
malt
gave
way
to
a
slightly
hoppy
drink
with
a
bitter
edge
but
nothing
to
wow
me
caramel
was
present
maybe
a
rounded
alcohol
remainder
okay
drinker
but
nothing
ill
seek
out
a
very
drinkable
beer
would
seek
after
it
again
a
nice
bock
for
the
winter
and
it
always
brings
about
a
smile
for
the
holidays
thanks
for
20
years
of
brewing
penn
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
once
and
done
for
me
solid
and
tasty
brew
that
i
would
have
again
d
very
drinkable
mostly
for
the
season
obviously
not
outstanding
but
it
is
a
solid
winter
bock
that
doesnt
disappoint
not
much
i
can
add
to
this
that
hasnt
been
said
about
any
bock
bier
a
good
representation
of
the
style
brown
body
with
a
decent
head
and
good
retention
aroma
of
caramel
malt
and
some
roastiness
in
the
taste
i
didnt
detect
any
spices
that
would
qualify
this
as
a
christmas
beerwinter
warmer
this
was
not
too
sweet
and
the
abv
was
hidden
i
could
have
had
another
one
during
this
sitting
a
very
drinkable
beer
thanks
to
muenchnerkindl
for
the
sample
i
couldnt
keep
downing
this
like
most
winter
beers
it
is
not
designed
for
mass
consumption
but
one
after
christmas
dinner
warms
and
relaxes
the
spirits
d
the
alcohol
wasnt
noticeable
this
beer
is
quiite
drinkable
it
holds
a
good
head
and
is
a
nice
deep
amber
in
color
i
have
been
feeding
this
beer
to
everyone
i
know
im
sure
there
are
more
detailed
reviews
for
this
beer
all
i
know
is
that
i
love
it
and
you
should
support
this
brewer
very
drinkable
i
must
have
had
a
dozen
glasses
that
day
and
it
never
got
old
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
but
unfortunately
ran
out
of
ice
am
just
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
cool
the
keg
back
down
to
have
the
last
bit
of
it
now
a
mighty
fine
bock
but
you
should
expect
that
of
penn
brewery
mellow
hoppiness
at
first
and
a
little
more
bitey
on
the
finish
another
great
apres
skior
better
yet
snowboard
beer
and
one
of
the
many
things
i
miss
about
pittsburgh
this
time
of
year
worth
your
while
for
certin
clean
medium
body
good
malty
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
i
cant
believe
this
is
7
5
abv
as
it
is
so
well
hidden
very
nice
pours
a
clean
copper
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
roasty
malt
caramel
and
a
small
chocolate
note
in
the
taste
quite
malty
and
some
cocoa
hints
a
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
and
a
malty
sweet
cocoa
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
yet
malty
for
some
a
nice
cocoa
sweetness
overall
this
a
very
tasty
beer
and
highly
drinkable
a
very
nice
christmas
brew
quite
good
not
the
biggest
malt
fan
but
this
was
very
tasty
just
enough
bitterness
to
contrast
the
overall
sweet
malt
profile
very
drinkable
perhaps
dangerously
so
with
the
abv
this
is
a
great
beer
from
pennsyvania
brewing
pours
a
nice
rich
root
beer
color
with
a
head
that
is
about
12
high
the
aroma
is
very
nice
it
gives
off
a
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
slight
roasted
note
taste
is
very
full
bodied
with
coffeechocolate
hints
and
some
roasted
character
but
not
too
much
that
it
tastes
burnt
in
any
way
the
hops
balance
everything
out
nicely
balance
is
the
key
here
as
it
has
a
lot
going
on
but
nothing
dominates
the
smoothness
is
incredible
perfect
mouthfeel
rich
and
full
without
being
sticky
or
thick
this
is
the
best
bock
beer
i
have
ever
enjoyed
this
is
a
true
holiday
treat
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
creamy
light
tan
head
with
very
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
burnt
and
roasted
malts
nuts
and
caramel
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
chocolate
hints
of
coffee
flavors
and
some
hops
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
bocks
that
i
have
had
this
beer
is
very
highly
recommended
overall
a
fine
example
of
a
bock
nice
layered
taste
that
is
actually
pretty
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
ample
carbonation
making
it
an
easy
to
drink
brew
overall
this
is
a
solid
bock
and
i
can
appreciate
it
even
though
its
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
my
first
penn
brewing
beer
and
hopefully
ill
have
a
chance
to
sample
more
in
the
future
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
lovely
clear
chestnut
color
with
ample
fluffy
offwhite
head
with
great
staying
power
the
aroma
well
kind
of
an
oddity
lots
of
spices
behind
or
in
front
of
a
solid
mass
of
maltiness
something
like
bread
an
odd
duck
but
actually
quite
nice
the
taste
is
also
different
but
well
done
sweet
and
toasty
malts
roll
around
the
tongue
for
a
bit
before
giving
way
to
spices
and
a
very
mild
alcohol
warming
with
the
appearance
of
a
fine
carbonation
keeping
it
lively
ending
dry
and
bittering
up
as
the
mouth
smooths
out
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
and
wasnt
quite
sure
how
id
rate
it
as
it
is
its
an
intelligent
bock
an
easy
to
drink
beer
and
one
im
very
glad
muenchenerkindl
sent
me
dark
burgandy

color
crystal
clear
thinnest
of
heads
the
smell
was
malty
sweet
and
a
little
roastedlike
the
flavor
was
richly
malty
but
surprisingly
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
not
bad
pretty
good
ill
try
it
again
this
winter
if
its
available
in
oh
drinkability
yeah
i
could
dump
back
a
six
pack
of
this
good
complex
but
not
too
complex
palate
and
a
light
body

abv
goes
unnoticed
until
the
3rd
or
4th
bottle
that
is
thanks
joe
this
stuff
is
worth
buying
a
case
of
very
tasty
and
a
sipper

sure

clear
dark

color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
tan

some
sticky

afterwards
the
nose
is
slightly
roasted

the
taste
is
malty
slightly
bitter
with
a
dry
finish
medium

drinkable
not
a

bock
at
that
cheers
poured
from

12
oz

crimson
with
a
bare
whisper
of
a
offwhite

head
that
virtually
disappeared
after
10
seconds
aroma
not
much
a
virtual
whimper
to
the
olfactory
senses
roasted
barley
maybe
a
slight
swirl
of
fresh
pine
thankfully
the
flavor
is
more
entertaining

poured
beer
from
bottle
to
tumbler
at
45
degrees
which
was
too
cold
beer
had
a
nice
dark
roasted
color
with
a
fine
bubbly
tan
head
roasted
hop
taste
light
nutty
slightly
beer
was
lighter
tasting
than
it
looked
i
though
the
beer
was
kinda
flat
tasting
also
but
might
just
have
been
this
bottle
even
though
i
did
not
give
this
beer
a
high
rating
i
believe
i
will
try
it
again
just
to
see
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
fridged
to
about
47
degrees
it
pours
a
ruby
colored
body
with
copper
tones
throughout
maybe
reverse
that
the
head
is
a
solid
surface
layer
of
pale
tan
color
that
reduces
itself
to
an
oily
surface
layer
with
some
slight
cling
on
the
edges
bold
and
malty
on
the
nose
some
fruits
come
through
to
me
right
away
cherries
along
with
some
chocolate
aroma
that
basically
reminds
me
of
malty
chocolate
covered
cherries
or
of
a
whitmans
cherryfilling
chocolate
square
malty
body
on
the
sip
followed
along
with
some
cherry
flavor
and
chocholate
that
makes
this
seem
like
a
nice
dessert
brew
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
some
hops
even
come
through
a
bit
sipping
the
tip
of
my
tongue
tingles
from
the
carbonation
but
the
alcohol
hides
in
this
one
quite
well
at
least
until
the
finish
and
aftertaste
which
sticks
around
a
bit
overall
drinkability
outstanding
brew
from
penn
i
am
not
an
overlyjoyous
fan
of
many
of
the
offerings
but
this
one
was
great
the
only
thing
hurting
the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
the
higher
alcohol
content
but
whos
counting
cheers
thanks
eclectic
for
the
opportunity
poured
a
dark
crimson
color
semiopaque
but
still
simmering
in
the
light
a
tan
colored
head
develops
but
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
some
lacing
and
some
big
bubbles
on
the
surface
aromas
of
dark
fruit
roasted
grains
plums
and
yeast
the
alcohol
and
fruit
flavors
dominate
sweet

flavors
come
in
a
wave
form
adding
depth
and
interest
to
the
beer
slightly
chewy
and
very
breadlike
in
the
finish
enough
sweetness
to
pair
nicely
with
sweet
dishes
and
still
bitter
enough
to
handle
creamy
sauces

on
brown

with
a
big
fluffy

alcohol
and
molasses
taste
is
good
malty
alcohol

hidden
but
there
is
a
minerally
taste
to
this
beer
must
be
the
water
carbonation
is
spot
on
for
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thick
but
that
is
to
be
expected
yet
the
alcohol
and
carbonation
keep
it
balanced

very
drinkable
thanks
to
secret
santa
and
imstillthegman
for
this
one
i
give
this
beer
4s
straight
down
i
had
this
beer
at
a
dive
of
a
college
bar
was
shocked
they
had
it
i
got
a
pitcher
beer
was
a
nice
dark
brown
in
appearance
which
a
nice
sweet
malty
smell
that
one
would
exepy
from
a
bock
inital
taste
was
nice
sweet
and
balanced
also
what
i
would
expect
from
a
well
made
bock
nice
medium
mouth
feel
all
the
way
though
leading
to
make
this
beer
nice
and
drinkable
i
ended
up
drinking
two
pitchers
of
it
and
got
cut
off
by
the
bartender
for
the
night
pours
a
deep
red
to
black
color
smell
is
fairly
average

is
good

like

to
it
with
nice
chocolate

a
little
hoppy

more
toward
the
sweet
side
and
excellent
winter
brew
that
should
be
available

round

i
could
have
gotten
this
in
years
past

im
glad
to
see
the

stepping

12
oz

color
with

foam
white
head
and
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
of
sweet
fruits
and
malts
make
up
a
mouth
watering
scent
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
some
sweet
fruit
malt
and
hop
bitterness
that
taste
like
fresh
cut
grass
smells
in
the
finish
a
medium
feel
in
the
mouth
is
not
to
heavy
or
light
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
penn
brews
and
very
easy
to
drink
thanks
for
this
one
muenchenerkindl
drinkabilitynotes
st
nick
is
different
than
most
bocks
that
ive
had
before
not
as
sweet
as
some
bocks
and
has
a
distinctive
roastedburnt
flavor
and
aroma
that
makes
it
interesting
the
meld
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
plus
the
bitterness
of
the
hallertau
hops
makes
for
a
pretty
well
balanced
though
malty
beer
a
cold
weather
sipper
for
sure
a
beer
to
savor
not
just
drink
highly
drinkable
with
the
7
5
abv
being
hidden
but
noticeable
on
the
face
highly
recommended
an
interesting
bock
bier
seek
and
enjoy
d
i
like
it
nothing
really
mind
blowing
to
me
but
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
enjoy
every
bit
of
it
the
beer
poured
into
the
glass
very
dark
amber
with
a
gorgeous
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
as
it
disappeared
in
the
smell
i
caught
hints
of
roasted
malt
as
i
expected
and
a
slightly
fruity
hops
odor
that
seemed
a
bit
stronger
than
i
had
expected
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
i
thought
the
taste
however
was
confusing
i
hope
that
the
complexity
of
the
brew
is
the
reason
and
not
a
years
worth
of
sitting
in
a
warehouse
it
tasted
not
bitter
not
tart
but
something
akin
to
sour
i
didnt
expect
that
perhaps
thats
what
it
should
be
from
the
other
reviews
ive
read
that
cite
raisin
or
berry
or
fruit
in
the
taste
even
so
no
matter
how
good
the
product
i
couldnt
give
this
batch
or
this
bottle
a
high
rating
ill
amend
when
i
find
it
fresh
everybody
need
to
try
this
christmas
jewel
this
is
my
first
penn
product
and
i
am
excited
to
try
the
others
in
the
variety
pack
good
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
thinner
than
i
thought
it
would
be
crisp
slightly
dry
finish
i
find
myself
wanting
to
grab
another
one
of
these
on
this
cool
night
the
bigfoot
i
had
first
was
a
bit
too
much
but
this
seems
just
right
d
very
drinkable
the
last
time
i
had
this
beer
i
was
graduated
from
the
pennsylvania
state
university
a
whopping
seven
years
ago
for
anyone
questioning
it
the
verb
graduated
is
correct
in
this
sentence
it
is
as
good
as
i
remember
and
worth
a
purchase
if
you
can
find
it
cheers
this
experiment
resulted
in
a
beer
that
is
arguably
better
than
the
fresher
samples
ive
had
excellent
mouthfeel
not
oily
finishes
with
a
nice
dryness
and
crispness
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
highly
sessionable
easy
to
drink
just
the
right
amount
complexity
in
flavors
and
drinkability
the
alcohol
is
balanced
well
in
the
beer
it
might
have
been
sprintime
but
a
winter
beer
like
this
would
be
welcome
on
my
lips
anytime
its
reasonably
big
and
quite
malty
but
its
also
crisp
and
a
joy
to
imbibe
the
abv
is
a
warmer
and
well
integrated
into
the
overal
personality
of
the
beer
meaning
that
does
its
part
in
maintaining
a
high
quotient
of
drinkability
this
is
one
brew
that
confirms
that
drinking
a
beer
out
of
season
should
be
pursued
whenever
possible

taste
has
a
reasonable
grain
base
but
seems
to
be
more
leaning
towards
the
tart
fruitiness
than
i
would
prefer
the
tartness
lingers
coupled
with
a
somewhat
chalky
aftertaste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
pretty
good
but
i
had
higher

touch

i
usually
do
not
like
cinnamon
but
in
this
beer
it
compliments
the
malt
nicely
taste
is
fruity
spicy
malty
and
supremely
enjoyable
leaves
a
nice
full
and
fruity
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
even
though
i
am
drinking
it
a
hot
spring
evening
it
really
hits
the
spor
i
am
sorry
i
only
bought
one
of
these
thanks
for
the
effort
anyway
beerbeing
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
id
ever
drink
a
bock
that
was
more
than
minimally
pleasant
and
ultimately
forgettable
st
nikolaus
bock
replaces
that
wonder
with
a
new
one
the
wonder
of
christmas
morning
when
the
present
that
brings
the
greatest
amount
of
joy
comes
from
the
least
likely
of
places
a
true
holiday
treasure
thanks
to
beerbeing
for
this
bottle
dissappointing
i
hope
i
have
the
opportunity
to
try
another
sample
as
a
solid
bock
can
be
real
pleasure
pours
a
dark
brownish
copper
with
a
small
light
tan

slowly
diminishing
head
some
nice
spotty
lacing
the
smell
dominated
by
malts
big
and
complex
the
taste
is
also
quite
nicely
big
without
being
overbearing
on
the
palate
damn
this
stuff
is
good
a
wonderful
malt
bomb
and
something
i
look
forward
every
winter
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
roasted
malts
with
a
small

this
is
a
smooth
nice
lager
that
has
good
balance
and
nice
roasted
malt
notes
an
enjoyable
and
not
overpowering
christmas
beer
ill
look
forward
to
it
at
christmas
yet
to
come
the
bloodhound
factor
this
is
perhaps
benjis
favorite
bock
he
begs
for
more
good
boy
this
was
served
to
me
at
bridgewaters
pub
with
a
big
thick
foamy
deeptan
head
the
nose
was
verymalty
with
an
almost
chocolatelike
sweetness
the
color
was
a
deep
garnet
or
ruby
red
so
dark
as
to
appear
black
until
held
up
to
the
light
the
mouthfeel
initially
struck
me
as
too
thin
for
a
bock
and
so
i
recommend
letting
it
warm
up
some
even
then
it
still
came
across
as
thin
but
the
flavors
really
came
alive
the
big
tatse
is
caramel
but
i
also
noted
a
fruity
taste
like
cherry
on
the
finish
overall
it
was
okay
but
id
prefer
something
bigger
and
chewier
for
the
holiday
season
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
overall
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
always
a
seasonal
staple
with
its
great
drinkability
you
can
bring
this
to
a
nice
holiday
party
and
it
will
be
enjoyed
by
all
overall
this
is
another
great
seasonal
beer
by
penn
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
little
warmth
around
the
holidays
cheers
drinkability
this
made
a
nice
well
rounded
winter
beer
that
i
could
drink
one
after
the
another
i
would
do
that
but
i
only
have
5
bottles
left
a
must
try
for
you
bock
lovers
keep
up
the
good
work
penn
brewing
company
from
the
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
aroma
caramel
malt
some
chocolate
hints
of
molasses
flavor
dark
fruits
cherries
raisins
brown
sugar
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
nice
full
mouthfeel
and
after
taste
stayed
around
just
long
enough
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
rich
and
complex
with
a
sound
malt
base
i
would
buy
a
case
of
this
i
sampled
a
12
ounce
bottle
that
came
with
freshness
dating
notched
onto
the
label
month
only
unfortunatly
pours
dark
honey
brown
with
a
rich
malty
nose
tan
head
leaving
some
sticky
lacing
medium
carbonation
and
also
medium
bodied
sweet
malty
brew
notes
of
vanilla
cookies
caramel
toffee
and
bananas
almond
nut
liquer
in
the
back
ground
nice
smooth
winter
sipper
a
2
finger
head
resulted
from
a
pouring
of
this
ruby
brown
beer
some
carbonation
rose
to
the
top
and
contributed
to
the
head
which
lasted
throughout
my
sampling
of
this
beer
the
smell
contained
the
scent
of
dark
chocolate
at
first
this
beer
tasted
sweet
and
then
became
bitter
and
contained
flavors
of
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
coffee
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
a
little
light
a
good
beer
which
i
look
forward
to
having
again
a
great
brew
im
still
a
bit
baffled
on
the
style
and
presentation
bock
doppelbock
or
santa
creamy
texture
that
is
smooth
on
the
initial
taste
and
the
finish
tasted
heavily
of
malt
i
hihgly
recommend
it
drinkability
and
overall
id
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
penn
brews
that
ive
had
balanced
yet
complex
unique
yet
tasty
i
think
im
going
to
pick
up
a
case
of
this
this
is
one
of
the
better
christmas
beers
ive
had
this
year
highly
recommended
try
it
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
color
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
there
is
minimal
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
candied
plums
caramel
apples
and
ginger
spice
no
not
the
exiled
spice
girl
a
hint
of
alcohol
detected
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
malty
not
as
sweet
or
as
robust
as
the
smell
cherries
and
grapes
linger
a
bit
still
some
hops
and
alcohol
present
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
coating
the
tongue
well
yet
smooth
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
as
well
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
it
may
have
been
the
night
but
i
wasnt
as
super
impressed
by
this
winter
beer
as
everyone
else
seems
to
be
appearance
is
a
nice
dark
brown
ruby
glowing
sort
of
beer
i
couldnt
really
get
much
happening
in
the
nose
area
may
have
been
environmental
taste
was
satisfying
its
a
smooth
and
spicy
beer
with
some
tastes
of
over
ripened
fruit
and
a
strong
saltiness
to
it
once
i
started
my
second
one
i
liked
it
a
bit
better
to
this
beers
credit
it
at
least
was
properly
spiced
which
i
can
not
say
for
this
years

offwhite

of
uniform
dense
foam
nice
amount
of
carbonation
bubbles
in
streamers
are
rather
separated
but
there
are
a
lot
of
streamers
when
held
away
from
light
this
is
a
very
very
dark
brown
beer
with
rosewood
highlights
when
held
to
light
it
positively
glows
a
shimmering
translucent
garnet
aroma
is
of
buttery
hallertau
hops
a
very
buttery
sensation
throughout
the
nose
itself
along
with
biscuits
and
bread
there
is
a
hint
of
raisiny
sweetness
flavor
is
very
good
starting
with
a
mellow
caramel
maltiness
this
builds
up
to
a
plateau
of
warm
spiciness
with
suggestions
of
clove
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
that
never
goes
over
the
top
but
remains
extremely
savory
never
exceeding
the
bounds
of
drinkability
finally
subsiding
into
a
very
delicate
suggestion
of
hops
at
the
back
of
the
palate
this
is
balanced
very
well
indeed
mouthfeel
includes
a
plucky
carbonation
but
is
a
bit
watery
in
the
middle
of
the
body
where
i
would
prefer
more
assertion
this
one
is
another
winner
from
penn
when
it
comes
to
sheer
drinkability
an
outright
chugger

you
find
this

this

a

recent
brew
than
my
days
in
pittsburgh
but
its
very
nice
i
wish
schell
would
do
this
kind
of
lager
for
the
holidays
rather
than
straying
into
englishstyle
ale
territory
so
much
thanks
to
an
old
pittsburgh
bud
p
d
for
the
bottle
probably
the
finest
offering
from
penn
brewery
and
sadly
only
a
holiday
offering
a
delicious
beer
with
a
nice
sweetness
and
something
ill
be
having
plenty
of
considering
i
just
got
half
a
case
dense
dark
brown
body
with
red
highlights
when
held
up
against
the
light
pale
colored
and
medium
sized
head
with
decent
carbonation
little
to
no
lace
left
on
the
glass
sweet
aroma
and
dominant
malt
taste
with
a
hint
of
sourness
no
hop
bitterness
whatsoever
a
nice
enhancement
to
the
flavor
is
achieved
with
a
small
helping
of
spices
appropriate
for
the
season
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
very
yummy
indeed
thanks
weissenheimer
for
putting
this
one
in
the
package
this
is
my
first
taste
of
a
bock
and
ill
be
back
for
more
ill
also
try
to
sample
more
of
the
offerings
of
this
brewery
when
i
get
around
to
pittsburgh
pours
a
nice
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
thinner
soapy
tan
head
good
lacing
has
that
nice
funky
bock
yeast
smell
as
well
as
some
bready
dark
malt
notes
and
a
fair
distinction
of
german
hops
rather
rich
and
smooth
the
malt
profile
of
this
beer
is
very
nice
earthy
and
caramelly
i
love
bocks
and
this
brewerys
beers
seem
a
little
underappreciated
but
they
are
pretty
much
right
on
target
with
their
german
replications
im
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
first
sip
because
its
spicier
than
the
bottled
version
the
flavor
carries
a
wellbalance
blend
of
molasses
caramel
hops
and
spices
none
of
those
elements
truly
wins
out
over
any
of
the
others
and
this
makes
it
quite
drinkable
its
more
challenging
than
the
harpoon
winter
warmer
but
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
pint
i
find
myself
welcoming
the
challenge
more
and
more
i
described
the
bottled
version
of
this
beer
as
a
wimpy
version
of
rogue
santas
private
reserve
but
this
seems
like
its
own
animal
the
spices
and
hops
are
more
unified
here
than
in
the
santas
a
toasty
foamy
its
far
from
overwhelming
the
palate
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
a
welcome
winter
specialty
that
can
be
enjoyed
with
a
meal
or
on
its

an

beer
one
can
is
plenty
as
its
so
rich
well
brewed
i
cracked
this
bad
boy
open
and
oh
how
i
wanted
to
canduct
an
inverted
glug
but
i
canstrained
myself
due
to
its
relative
age
i
still
got
a
little
better
than
a
skim
of
tawny
head
but
the
bartenders
trick
is
mt
best
friend
of
late
and
this
created
a

finger
of

falling

overall
this
oskar

brew
is
quite
good
just
nothing
to
brag
about
this
is
definitely
confused
but
delicious
rye
bock
bock
no
rye
absolutely
this
seems
more
analogous
to
something
like
the
august
schell
emerald
rye
lager
than
a
rye
bock
a
definite
miss
on
the
style
but
an
absolute
winner
for
any
fan
of
rye
there
are
a
lot
of
competing
flavors
here
and
it
mostly
works
i
probably
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
was
a
bock
if
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
drinking
because
the
bock
flavors
are
overshadowed
by
the
unique
combination
of
hops
rye
and
wheat
its
interesting

bock
has
some
real
nice

flavors
without
being

very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
easily
surprised
how
much
the
hop
character
shines
through
even
after
all
this
time
mouthfeel
is
slick
with
a
medium
body
mild
carbonation
and
an
easy
flow
as
it
goes
down
a
really
good
bock
and
a
fine
collaboration
this
was

hoppier
than

bocks

hops
alcohol
pine

citrus

alcohol
with
a

and
a
mix
of
sweet
and
bitter
notes
in
the
finish
quite
hoppy
for
a
bock
style
beer
interesting
enjoyable
pretty
big
disappointment
actually
resulted
in
a
drain
pour
dark
orange
semihazy
with
a
nice
one
inch
head
faded
after
a
couple
minutes
to
about
a
quarter
inch
nice
lacing
aroma
was
sweet
with
a
bit
of
honey
wheat
and
some
peppery
rye
notes
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
tropical
fruit
flavors
as
well
this
was
somewhat
similar
to
the
yonder
bock
with
the
addition
of
the
peppery
bite
from
the
rye
the
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
and
smooth
quite
nice
quite
tasty
id
buy
this
one
again
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
bock
the
rye
spice
and
fruit
notes
add
a
nice
kick
a
slightly
above
average
beer
about
par
for
the
course
for
the
beer
camp
series
obocks
are
usually
available
in
the
spring
but
this
summer
offering
would
likely
pair
well
with
barbecue
chicken
or
pork
or
another
slightly
spicy
or
smoky
meal
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
consider
purchasing
for
cooler
spring
nights
if
available
again

b
o
this
one
is
nice
the
rye
character
isnt
the
most
noticeable
but
i
think
it
does
a
great
part
in
the
body
for
crisping
up
what
is
usually
a
sweeter
style
overall
a
complex
and
tasty
one
off
beer
much
better
than
i
expected
o
a
very
flavorful
bock
as
expected
given
the
name
an
interesting
member
of
the
bcaa
series
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
with
some
rye
and
light
fruity
notes
i
do
get
a
bit
of
drying
on
the
finish
and
a
peppery
bite
too
the
beer
drinks
very
easy
and
i
am
done
with
the
can
much
faster
than
i
anticipated
when
i
opened
the
can
pours
redish
brown
with
a
thick
white
head
flavors
of
rye
and
wheat
are
heavy
throughout
super
balanced
would
totally
drink
again

finish
is
sweet
rye
and
grains
some
yeast
and
barley
fruity
and
slight
rye
nutty
ending
overall
a
good
drinking
brew
the
beer
has
a
definite
rye
nose
wrapped
in
earthy
woodsy
hops
its
brilliant
chestnut
with
an
offwhite
foam
cap
a
very
creamy
palate
features
rye
body
and
spiciness
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
barley
malt
and
the
rye
with
a
big
bitter
hop
finish
the
beer
has
a
medium
full
body
and
medium
to
medium
low
carbonation
this
a
nice
hoppy
brew
for
the
style
that
did
have
the
bock
yeast
strain
base
taste
the
last
of
the
12pack
i
grabbed
at
tipples
a
while
back
now
pours
deep
reddish
orange
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
very
nice
looking
aroma
of

and
a

balance
flavor
is
a

bomb
deep
dark

candi
sugar
just
kind
of
a
big
malt
bomb
here
without
much
else
going
on
medium
plus
bodied
with
medium
low
carbonation
this
was
a
good
bit
uninspiring
and
not
something
i
want
to
drink
again
copper

clear
thin

decent

aroma

herbal
taste
is

a

a

overall
i
think
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
on
draft
mote
than
the
can
i
would
still
drink
it
again
though
othere
is
nothing
bad
to
this
beer
just
that
there
is
nothing
good
to
this
beer
absolutely
fabulous
growler
to
pint
glass
pours
well
and
finishes
better
cant
get
enough
solid
but
nothing
overly
memorable
definitely
more
rye
than
bock
there
are
sips
of
this
beer
that
i
find
to
be
good
and
some
sips
that
just
seem
to
not
really
come
together
all
that
well
probably
more
of
the
latter
i
like
the
elements
that
make
it
up
but
the
final
flavor
just
doesnt
work
out
for
me
the
ryes
spice
and
sweets
clash
sometimes
with
the
citrus
which
clashes
with
the
apple
and
grape
fruit
flavors
present
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
dont
think
the
vision
results
in
a
balanced
final
product
this
is
honestly
a
solid
beer
everything
about
it
is
fruity
the
hops
and
the
malt
are
great
together
and
reminds
me
of
a
cigar
city
ipa
not
sure
why
this
isnt
rated
higher
o
unlike
any
other
bock
i
have
had
by
a
long
shot
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
interplay
between
the
fruity
hops
sweet
malts
and
spicy
rye
would
definitely
buy
again
if
sold
in
singles
overall
this
was
pretty
terrible
i
guess
i
do
like
lagers
best
beer
i
have
had
out
of
a
can
period
its
an
amber
brew
w
a
fairly
thick
head
smells
slightly
sweet
fruity
the
flavor
starts
off
malty
but
finishes
with
a
punch
of
hops
very
interesting
bock
solid
brew
but
i
would
put
the
beer
camp
cigar
city
tropical
maibock
above
this
offering
o
one
of
my
favorites
out
of
this
case
very
well
done
and
tasty
brew
poured
from
a
can
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
two
finger
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
nice
aroma
of
caramel
malt
light
tropical
fruit
and
rye
flavor
of
bready
and
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
biscuit
citrus
juice
and
an
assertive
dose
of
tart
rye
grassy
hops
medium
bodied
with
peppery
carbonation
an
interesting
hybrid
of
bock
and
hopped
rye
there
is
moderate
bock
style
malt
flavors
here
but
they
are
pushed
into
the
background
by
the
peppery
hops
and
semitart
rye
flavors
which
combine
very
nicely
certainly
not
a
traditional
bock
but
an
interesting
and
tasty
variant
of
rye
ales
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
lightly
sweet
and
full
throughout
the
mouth
then
drying
leading
to
believe
that
there
area
some
stronger
hop
undertones
a
rye
bock
consider
my
curiosity
aroused
a
fairly
active
pour
yields
a
large
voluminous
two
plus
fingers
worthy
of
crisp
frothy
light
khaki
colored
head
comprised
of
mostly
large
chunky
bubbles
excellent
retention
the
color
is
a
chameleon
light
mix
of
light
gold
and
dark
copper
that
changes
based
upon
the
lighting
a
moderate
bit
of
exceedingly
small
bubbled
carbonation
rises
sluggishly
throughout
the
nose
is
kind
of
hard
to
place
a
mix
of
toasted
malt
and
overly
ripened
fruits
some
light
caramel
notes
as
well
toffee
some
light
brown
sugar
perhaps
just
the
faintest
hint
of
rye
quite
tasty
stays
true
to
the
aroma
there
may
be
the
addition
of
some
faint
semi
sweet
chocolate
no
standouts
just
great
harmony
amongst
the
various
flavors
goes
down
easily
sip
after
sip
uber
quaffable
i
cant
quite
place
my
finger
on
it
as
there
is
nothing
earth
shattering
about
this
beer
its
just
really
solid
and
highly
enjoyable
in
every
facet
all
the
components
work
well
together
to
yield
something
that
is
much
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
terrific
job
by
sierra
nevada
and
oskar
blues
this
would
be
staple
on
my
rotation
if
readily
available
and
year
round
hands
down
the
best
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
collection
that
ive
tried
o
complex
flavors
interesting
overall
a
good
collab
effort
where
the
base
beer
is
still
recognizable
and
whats
added
to
make
it
different
works
o
i
would
rate
this
one
5
of
the
12
box
series
pretty
decent
rye
always
perks
things
up
love
my
ryes
and
reds
and
this
one
was
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
better
ryes
ive
had
excellent
job
d
a
very
crushable
lager
not
my
favorite
of
the
pack
but
this
is
very
nicely
balanced
and
has
some
great
rye
malt
flavor
in
unison
with
some
nice
hop
action
another
lovely
cantribution
to
the
beercamp
collab
pack
overall
an
interesting
crossover
style
sure
it
has
some
bock
elements
but
there
is
a
lot
more
to
this
beer
those
looking
for
a
traditional
bock
will
likely
be
disappointed
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
overall
a
good
beer
overall
ok
but
the
combination
of
all
the
various
flavors
on
the
finish
really
come
together
for
a
bleh
flavor
almost
bbq
sauce
like
but
not
quite
tehre
the
sweet
syrupy
notes
with
biscuit
toffee
fruity
flavors
from
rye
and
hops
mild
bitterness
and
earthy
hop
notes
bring
this
together
for
the
bleh
otherwise
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
bock
aspect
gets
overpowered
and
the
rye
is
not
that
great
either
the
taste
is
dry
at
first
with
toasted
grainy
flavor
with
slihgtly
fruity
yeast
with
mild
pine
flavor
from
the
hops
and
slight
caramel
sweetness
supporting
the
bitterness
well
there
is
a
slight
earthiness
of
rye
with
almost
molasses
like
accent
and
dark
syrup
roundness
with
woody
flavor
and
light
citrus
accent
coming
through
toward
the
finish
wiht
semidry
element
with
nice
hop
bitterness
lingering
as
it
is
fairly
clean
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
bock
with
nice
balance
and
depth
of
flavor
very
drinkable
for
the
strength
bottle
poured
an
amber
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
spicy
rye
notes
with
some
citrus
and
earthy
hoppy
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
dominated
by
light
dry
spicy
rye
notes
with
some
citrus
and
earthy
hops
that
are
easily
noticeable
with
a
medium
bitter
finish
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
another
easy
to
drink
beer
from
this
series
very
crisp
and
a
bit
dry
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
taste
is
both
smooth
and
malty
with
a
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
hops
followthrough
i
get
both
a
sharp
rye
malt
bill
and
plenty
of
hops
lovely
tasty
and
very
balanced
smell
is
heavy
malt
caramel
brown
sugar
lots
of
rye
floral
hops
hay
and
straw
the
flavor
is
a
little
dough
rye
and
malt
caramel
mixed
with
the
brightness
of
citrus
hops
and
a
grapefruit
finish
overall
this
is
pretty
good
another
favorite
of
the
beer
camp
collabs
taste
is
a
home
run
as
a
huge
fan
of
bocks
and
rye
brews
this
is
a
dream
brew
for
me
the
flavor
is
full
and
rich
syrupy
without
being
overbearing
grapes
rye
grain
candied
sugar
toasted
malt
caramel
really
nice
with
only
3
beers
left
in
the
set
to
try
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
highlights
for
me
poured
into
a
sierra
nevada
pint
glass
with
a
big
white
head
see
through
copper
color
with
small
amount
of
bubbles
sweet
malty
hoppy
smell
hoppy
sweet
taste
with
a
good
toast
malt
backbone
and
slight
amount
of
rye
spice
pretty
smooth
creamy
beer
but
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
overall
this
is
fantastic
and
the
only
thing
i
think
it
needs
it
a
little
more
carbonation
overall
very
hoppy
for
a
bock
which
cuts
some
of
the
desired
malt
character
i
look
for
even
for
a
maibock
this
one
pushes
it
too
far
i
think
i
would
like
the
balance
better
if
this
was
an
ale
and
not
a
lager
finish
is
fairly
astringent
interesting
but
not
amazing
the
rye
really
is
highlighted
though
nose
of
piney
hops
with
warming
bit
muddled
cold
rye
is
evident
taste
is
lightly
sweet
with
coarse
caramel
notes
and
some
spice
feel
is
neutral
though
a
bit
sweet
and
seems
a
bit
unispired
though
that
doesnt
surprise
me
given
my
experience
with
oskar
blues
coarse
feel
and
finish
drinkable
yet
bock
doesnt
come
to
mind
as
much
as
amber
lager
does
and
that
diminishes
with
warming
update
finish
is
sweet
and
malty
with
just
too
much
caramel
and
not
enough
of
clean
bock
sense
in
fact
not
bock
like
at
all
just
too
syrupy
overall
overall
not
the
best
beer
imo
seems
it
is
having
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
not
quite
sure
what
they
were
going
for
but
this
is
a
miss
from
the
beer
camp
12
pack
excellent
creamy
head
and
lace
nice
fruity
hops
with
a
medium
bitter
finish
lots
of
malt
and
spicy
rye
flavors
they
should
make
this
stuff
regularly
i
would
buy
it
o
very
very
good
rye
bock
goes
down
pretty
smooth
considering
the
abv
not
a
horrible
drinking
experience
i
just
got
no
idea
what
they
were
going
for
some
slightly
fruity
notes
that
remind
me
of
fruity
pebbles
getting
some
rye
in
the
finish
but
that
is
about
it
a
little
bit
of
booze
towards
the
finish
as
well
not
getting
a
ton
of
bocklike
cleanness
that
i
desire
drinkable
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
this
variety
pack
overall
very
cool
unique
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
and
contemplating
smells
of
spicy
rye
and
citrusy
hops
great
interplay
between
the
hops
and
rye
malt
taste
is
more
of
the
same
but
with
a
nice
twist
in
the
finish
begins
with
a
bready
sweet
malt
flavor
that
gives
way
to
the
spicy
rye
and
citrus
hops
the
finish
has
a
nice
and
surprising
tropical
tooth
fruity
type
finish
really
surprised
me
on
the
first
taste
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
well
done
brew
one
of
my
favorite
from
the
beer
camp
12
pack
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
crisp
and
lively
carbonation
not
bad
but
quite
mineral
filled
and
bitter
for
a
bock
superb
looking
beer
has
a
durable
bonecolored
creamy
head
that
leaves
the
glass
well
coated
lovely
orangeamber
body
with
excellet
clarity
flavor
is
a
rather
hoppy
rye
bock
perhaps
as
much
like
an
apa
as
a
bock
excellent
smooth
feel
with
lively
carbonation
amber
body
capped
by
an
offwhite
head
rye
grain
toffee
and
citrus
aromas
rich
rye
malty
flavors
pepper
fruity
finish
billed
as
a
rye
bock
this
screams
out
pale
ale
in
appearance
and
scent
whats
interesting
is
that
this
is
quite
fruity
to
taste
despite
no
evidence
in
aroma
rye
malt
and
tea
leaf
mix
with
lemon
lime
tangerines
floral
perfume
honeysuckle
and
apricot
to
form
a
beer
that
is
unconventional
and
off
beat
i
like
it
despite
it
being
unlike
any
bock
ive
ever
had
or
for
that
matter
any
rye
nice
hop
aroma
and
flavor
needs
a
bigger
malt
body
to
carry
the
bock
name
imo
overall
a
very
good
brew
and
another
winner
in
the
beer
camp
across
america
pack
o
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
its
just
very
bland
and
boring
the
nose
was
next
to
nonexistent
and
the
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
my
least
favorite
from
the
beer
camp
across
america
2
5
served
in
a
mug
overall
a
solid
beer
maybe
not
necessary
to
style
but
i
enjoyed
all
the
tropical
and
spicy
flavors
o
im
really
enjoying
the
rye
in
this
one
as
it
gives
a
different
perspective
on
bocks
its
another
solid
part
of
the
12pack
a
well
done
rye
beer
solid
malt
backbone
with
just
enough
hop
highlights
to
stay
balanced
o
a
decent
beer
a
touch
sweeter
than
id
prefer
flavorful
but
not
bold
overall
pleasant
but
a
bit
forgettable
a
tasty
beer
not
necesarily
a
classic
bock
beer
but
it
is
still
refreshing
unusual
and
enjoyable
o
lots
of
things
going
on
with
this
beer
but
it
never
hit
a
point
of
balance
for
me
tasted
good
not
great
liked
the
smell
better
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
didnt
wow
me
im
all
for
a
tasty
bock
and
this
fits
the
bill
an
ok
bock
could
have
played
up
the
rye
a
bit
more
o
the
rye
spiciness
and
fruityherbal
hops
add
an
interesting
twist
on
a
traditionally
malty
style
somewhat
a
hybrid
but
definitely
a
successful
one
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
worth
grabbing
if
you
get
the
chance
overall
a
big
and
sweet
rye
and
wheat
beer
i
should
restate
that
this
is
rather
sweet
but
yet
it
is
still
rather
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
an
interesting
tropical
fruit
flavored
rye
bock
beer
overall
not
a
very
interesting
beer
imo
rye
needs
to
be
balanced
better
too
heavy
handed
poured
a
gorgeous
clear
amber
color
with
a
nice
bit
of
bubbles
and
a
wonderful
fluffy
two
finger
offwhite
head
a
very
nice
looking
beer
scents
of
rye
toast
tangy
sweet
orange
flesh
marmalade
apricot
jelly
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
white
wheat
bread
a
very
nice
sweet
malty
and
bright
fruity
aroma
profile
it
is
enticing
and
showcases
the
ingredients
nicely
flavor
begins
with
a
nice
bit
of
spicy
rye
toast
mingling
with
marmalade
tangy
wheat
and
a
lightly
bitter
orange
peel
flavor
this
moves
into
a
middle
with
a
more
moderate
level
of
bitterness
with
flavors
of
orange
peel
more
overt
toasty
rye
a
bit
of
alcohol
and
hint
of
grapefruit
peel
and
floral
hops
finish
is
lightly
sweet
but
balanced
with
a
light
level
of
bitterness
with
notes
of
toasted
rye
orange
peel
a
bit
of
wheat
bread
and
tangy
wheat
malt
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
aftertaste
is
toasted
spicy
rye
bitter
orange
peel
and
a
hint
of
white
wheat
bread
a
good
flavor
profile
that
is
quite
complex
in
its
overall
makeup
yet
stays
bright
and
refreshing
very
nicely
done
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
easy
drinking
feel
very
nice
and
quite
refreshing
in
body
despite
the
beers
abv
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
took
some
good
ingredients
and
made
a
wonderful
end
product
its
malty
and
rich
yet
also
bright
fruity
and
refreshing
the
aroma
is
also
superb
and
the
mouthfeel
enhances
the
overall
impression
very
well
done
the
body
is
nicely
medium
although
not
as
smooth
as
most
bocks
drinkability
was
very
good
the
beer
went
easily
enough
overall
a
pleasant
enough
brew
if
it
were
on
tap
id
have
a
pint
or
two
o
its
ok
its
got
some
sweet
fruit
combined
with
the
caramel
i
like
the
cracker
flavor
in
here
its
well
rounded
enjoyable
but
nothing
amazing
pours
a
really
wonderful
looking
deep
transluscent
amber
with
an
inviting
soft
white
head
that
gently
sticks
to
the
edge
of
your
glass
smell
is
a
bit
underwhelming
for
me
its
not
bad
in
any
way
but
it
is
really
muted
i
love
to
sniff
so
smell
is
a
must
for
me
what
is
there
is
mostly
mild
hops
and
faint
rye
taste
is
pretty
solid
good
all
around
but
again
fairly
benign
i
think
sierra
nevada
and
the
collaborators
weret
really
trying
to
ruffle
any
feathers
with
these
beers
or
break
any
new
ground
as
everything
so
far
seems
to
be
pretty
mild
nutty
earthy
some
citrusy
hops
and
i
get
the
very
faint
notes
of
anise
or
fennel
some
pleasant
rye
and
caroway
aftertaste
moderate
body
with
lively
carbonation
overall
decent
but
like
usual
i
wish
the
rye
flavor
was
a
little
more
robust
the
taste
is
malty
and
sweet
for
the
most
part
with
a
hit
of
rye
flavor
and
a
bit
of
spice
fair
earthy
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
but
not
taking
away
from
the
brew
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
ale
overall
nice
rye
and
sweetness
made
me
want
a
good
whiskey
overall
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
especially
considering
that
it
hasnt
gotten
as
much
buzz
as
some
of
the
other
beers
in
the
box
i
like
rye
beers
so
perhaps
this
one
speaks
to
me
more
than
to
most
people
i
was
impressed
with
how
detectible
the
rye
was
in
this
beersometimes
it
can
be
just
a
fleeting
afterthought
that
allows
the
brewer
to
put
that
sexy
rye
on
the
label
not
so
in
this
case
id
gladly
buy
another
round
of
this
one
if
it
were
available
for
regular
purchase
o
this
is
more
what
i
had
in
mind
from
the
cigar
city
collaboration
super
crushable
with
a
vibrant
exotic
and
tropical
hop
profile
perfect
summer
quencher
style
guidelines
really
dont
apply
here
but
who
cares
the
ends
justify
the
means
this
one
needs
to
be
more
than
a
onetime
deal
easily
in
my
top
three
favorites
from
this
mix
pack
o
tastes
like
a
strong
ale
without
a
real
style
there
is
a
big
malt
and
big
hop
presence
but
not
really
balanced
or
complementing
one
another
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
overall
a
great
offering
for
my
first
experience
with
the
beer
camp
i
am
enthusiastic
about
this
particular
brewing
variation
and
i
hope
others
will
do
some
experimentation
along
these
lines
im
not
so
crazy
about
this
particular
example
but
i
think
there
are
possibilities
here
from
the
12
oz
can
included
in
the
beer
camp
2014
boxed
set
o
this
beer
sounded
so
good
plenty
to
like
but
the
bitterness
left
in
the
wake
of
the
faded
hops
was
distracting
the
beer
looks
nice
and
smells
like
cotton
candy
sweet
profile
in
a
very
malty
kind
of
way
too
much
so
for
my
tastes
minimal
rye
influence
on
this
barely
an
accent
smooth
feel
easy
enough
to
drink
i
suppose
this
is
not
really
a
style
that
i
appreciate
so
perhaps
that
is
why
i
am
not
overly
impressed
by
it
o
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
but
this
beer
certainly
makes
me
want
to
dedicate
another
spot
in
my
fridge
to
more
bock
i
absolutely
love
rye
and
how
it
works
with
beer
canfusion
totally
delivers
on
taste
its
smooth
and
creamy
with
wonderful
flavors
of
citrus
spice
tangy
notes
of
orange
and
a
slight
pepper
finish
i
really
love
the
different
aspects
of
this
beer
and
how
they
combine
together
overall
a
solid
rye
beer
but
not
much
of
a
bock
o
not
bad
not
my
favorite
style
but
quite
drinkable
nice
hop
presence
cuts
the
malt
enough
to
really
balance
this
off
nicely
worth
a
shot
o
the
hops
inject
a
lot
of
fruity
flavors
into
this
bock
making
for
an
interesting
change
of
pace
for
an
otherwise
normally
malty
style
o
crisp
and
lean
but
also
warm
and
wellrounded
easy
to
drink
mild
bitterness
maltforward
but
with
enough
hoppiness
to
create
an
inviting
brew
great
job
guys
this
one
was
the
best
so
far
of
the
bunch
in
my
opinion
o
great
beer
in
a
nice

o
a
very
easy
drinking
beer

mindlbowng

enjoyable

a
very
enjoyable
offering
the
verdict
very
good
by
far
the
best
ive
had
from
a
can
labeled
oskar
blues
ive
surprised
by
the
nuance
and
depth
of
this
one
if
they
had
more
like
this
id
be
a
big
fan
of
oskar
o
not
my
thing
i
guess
the
name
canfusion
is
a
suitable
name
to
describe
how
this
beer
came
across
my
palate
pours
amberhoney
with
thick
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
aroma
of
sweet
darker
malts
fruity
apple
aroma
slight
bock
aroma
but
more
hoppy
malty
taste
up
front
followed
by
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
with
bitter
apple
aftertaste
at
the
end
you
can
appreciate
the
rye
on
the
back
end
not
really
what
i
expect
from
a
bock
pleasantly
surprised
ill
make
this
short
and
sweet
as
im
just
cracking
open
the
12
pack
of
this
collaboration
series
while
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
especially
due
to
its
high
price
i
am
not
pleased
that
the
bottle
on
dates
are
as
old
as
may
of
this
year
and
this
is
just
hitting
some
markets
who
was
the
genius
that
thought
this
would
be
a
good
marketing
idea
this
really
could
be
an
excellent
series
and
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
sierra
nevada
but
seriously
you
couldnt
do
a
better
job
of
getting
relatively
fresh
beers
out
the
door
instead
of
what
appears
to
be
just
another
attempt
to
cash
in
on
the
popularity
of
the
craft
brew
industry
im
not
saying
the
beers
are
horrible
and
the
reason
i
bought
this
12
pack
was
that
some
of
breweries
dont
distribute
in
texas
but
i
dont
encourage
or
recommend
anyone
buy
this
series
at
its
inflated
price
definitely
a
fail
as
far
as
im
concerned
clear
amber
pour
with
a
frothy
offwhite
onefinger
head
aroma
has
a
strong
floral
and
fruit
smell
flavor
is
somewhat
peppery
upfront
balanced
by
citrusy
hops
has
a
very
nice
malt
presence
as
the
beer
warms
with
raisin
plum
bread
and
caramel
flavors
finish
is
slightly
sweet
pours
out
an
orangey
amber
with
hardly
any
head
interesting
smell
caramel
malts
booze
and
a
good
bit
of
rye
spiciness
flavor
leans
more
toward
malted
barley
caramellike
flavors
more
typical
of
a
bock
rye
is
more
apparent
on
the
back
end
lending
it
a
spiciness
and
dryness
carbonation
is
smooth
and
the
body
is
moderate
to
full
interesting
take
on
a
bock
the
rye
works
here
onot
exactly
to
my
tune
its
actually
a
bit
boring
surprising
coming
from
the
two
brewers
overall
pretty
nice
beer
hard
to
compare
it
to
anything
else
since
this
is
the
first
of
the
style
ive
had
i
feel
theres
something
missing
that
could
make
this
world
class
it
tastes
like
a
few
good
things
from
a
few
styles
mixed
into
one
beer
maybe
a
little
more
bitter
hops
to
tame
down
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
still
glad
i
got
to
try
12oz
can
served
in
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
dull
copper
with
a
voluminous
1
5
inch
sizzling
creamcolored
head
nose
is
somewhat
unassuming
a
trace
of
fruity
and
notes
of
rye
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
addition
of
some
citrus
and
an
earthyherbal
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
slight
oiliness
and
a
prickly
carbonation
that
leaves
a
residual
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
not
bad
but
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
a
bit
too
unpronounced
while
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
assertive
its
not
earth
shattering
but
it
is
a
real
well
constructed
brew
probably
my
favorite
in
the
series
like
many
of
the
other
beer
camp
series
its
solid
but
nothing
superb
i
dont
know
if
this
experiment
really
worked
out
well
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
slightly
confusing
canfusing
i
dont
think
id
order
it
if
it
came
in
a
sixer
but
neither
do
i
think
id
turn
it
down
if
offered
at
a
party
overall
3
75
a
very
good
beer
its
a
bock
though
classical
bock
characteristics
are
not
the
emphasis
or
strong
suit
necessarily
of
this
beer
not
surprisingly
its
the
rye
and
this
ella
hop
varietal
that
are
emphasized
here
and
its
quite
clear
still
its
pulled
off
with
enough
finesse
that
you
dont
forget
what
the
beer
is
and
you
can
focus
on
whichever
sides
of
it
you
please
personally
im
pleased
that
its
so
drinkable
looks
great
and
legitimately
pulls
off
a
fusion
of
disparate
style
and
ingredients
overall
good
beer
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
sweetness
aroma
is
nice
i
could
see
this
being
really
good
if
it
attenuated
just
a
bit
more
part
of
the
beer
camp
complication
a
collaboration
between
oskar
blues
and
sierra
nevada
pours
out
the
can
a
delightful
dark
copper
with
more
than
enough
thick
white
foam
large
bock
flavors
come
through
on
the
nose
and
then
a
hint
of
the
dry
earthy
rye
kicks
in
this
guy
tastes
a
lot
like
the
nose
the
bock
coming
through
but
just
not
enough
of
the
rye
for
me
im
a
big
rye
fan
and
when
i
see
rye
i
expect
some
serious
rye
flavors
im
talking
cain
and
ebel
rye
flavor
red
rye
ipa
flavors
however
its
a
well
made
beer
excellent
malt
backbone
great
mouthfeel
super
smooth
overall
a
well
made
beer
and
very
drinkable
for
7
abv
but
just
not
enough
rye
coming
through
to
make
me
excited

maybe
my
least
favorite
beer
of
beer
camp
here
a
rye
bock
but
it
seems
samey
and
sloppy
a
little
bit
to
me
clear
amber
copper
color
with
a
decently
long
lasting
white
head
not
problems
with
the
appearance
of
this
one
the
nose
is
maybe
over
hopped
not
citrusy
like
the
label
says
but
just
bitter
and
at
the
expense
of
the
rye
which
can
barley
be
smelled
at
all
there
is
also
a
weird
lager
yeast
character
unbecoming
to
the
beer
maybe
fermented
too
warm
tough
to
say
from
the
smell
alone
the
taste
lack
much
hop
flavor
just
the
bitterness
same
as
the
nose
and
the
rye
part
of
it
seems
underdone
i
keep
looking
for
more
of
it
with
each
sip
and
i
am
getting
nowhere
maybe
a
little
spice
to
the
finish
but
its
not
distinctly
rye
malt
and
seems
a
little
out
of
place
in
a
bock
style
maybe
its
just
a
style
that
doesnt
appeal
much
to
me
but
even
if
this
beer
is
well
made
its
just
not
all
that
enjoyable
i
drank
it
down
no
problem
but
would
rather
have
almost
any
other
beer
in
the
box
before
this
one
again
just
largely
unremarkable
on
the
whole
overall
incredibly
easy
to
enjoy
and
im
glad
i
was
in
line
to
catch
this
variety
pack
in
the
pittsburgh
beer
market
o
they
made
this
idea
work
i
like
it
and
would
buy
again
overall
another
very
well
executed
bock
beer
from
the
beer
camp
pack
great
flavor
strong
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
floral
hops
for
balance
its
mediumlight
body
makes
quick
work
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
creamy
body
and
prefers
a
spicybitter
finish
of
leaf
citrus
peel
and
herb
but
in
the
end
the
rye
character
is
lacking
dwarfed
by
a
nondescribptive
sweetness
that
renders
the
beer
as
highly
neutral
tasting
poured
ontap
at
a

takeover
the
beer
was

of

are

pours
a

color
with
over
an
inch
of
thick
head
good
amount
of
lacing
malty
aroma
with
lots
of

the
taste
is

and
peppery

followed
by
some
nice

floral
at
times
with
some

and

presence
finishes
with
more
of
the
rye
and
spices
lots
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
fairly
noticeable
alcohol
presence
this
beer
has
lots
of
the
rye
flavor
but
with
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
to
it
overall
a
nice
surprise
pours
a
brilliant
copper
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
disappears
halfway
through
consumption
but
its
easily
revived
with
a
swirl
of
the
glass
very
nice
combination
of
flavors
going
on
here
the
nose
is
amazing
loads
of
caramel
the
malt
presence
is
mild
but
there
the
hops
are
similarly
present
but
not
overwhelming
very
well
balanced
beer
im
about
halfway
through
the
beercamp
case
and
this
is
the
first
beer
that
made
me
sit
up
and
go
whoa
boss
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
id
readily
buy
this
again
if
sierraoskar
made
it
a
regular
distribution
beer
the
other
beers
in
the
case
have
been
consistently
pretty
good
this
one
is
a
good
bit
better
than
that
interesting
concept
i
like
the
malt
character
and
the
hops
play
well
against
it
rye
doesnt
dominate
but
adds
a
nice
spiciness
at
the
finish
on
a
final
note
im
thrilled
with
this
sampler
pack
and
am
so
glad
that
i
picked
it
up
im
looking
forward
to
many
more
collaborations
from
these
brewers
in
the
future
theres
a
understated
caramel
character
with
a
peppery
rye
spice
and
a
touch
of
piney
hops
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
and
the
second
can
grew
on
me
even
more
than
the
first
this
might
be
the
sleeper
hit
of
the
case
overall
this
is
another
excellent
beer
from
this
mixed
12
why
would
i
expect
anything
else
from
all
these
great
collaborators
o
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
from
beer
camp
when
i
got
the
box
was
hoping
for
original
takes
on
styles
and
this
one
certainly
qualifies
why
dont
we
have
more
rye
bocks
out
there
seems
like
its
a
winning
combination
worth
exploring
further
favorite
from
the
pack
so
far
in
all
it
is
a
well
balanced
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
grab
in
a
12pk
that
was
just
understated
because
this
was
awesome
best
of
the
beer
camp
bunch
the
aftertaste
is
of
a
mild
rye
beer
bitter
and
hoppy
but
it
is
tempered
by
the
bock
beer
flavor
the
burp
though
is
quite
a
treat
overall
it
is
a
very
good
unique
brew
solid
maybe
i
should
have
had
it
a
little
colder
but
it
just
not
as
clean
as
id
want
and
expect
the
best
bocks
to
be
and
the
rye
was
under
represented
in
my
mind
still
worth
a
taste
and
a
good
start
to
this
12er
i
stuck
12
the
glass
in
the
freezer
for
a
bit
and
it
did
seem
to
clean
up
some
im
not
changing
my
scores
but
it
was
a
little
better
the
beer
pours
a
decent
amount
of
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
still
leaves
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
light
brown
that
appears
almost
orange
which
is
unlike
any
bock
ive
had
before
the
smell
is
sweet
as
a
traditional
bock
but
with
strong
rye
notes
that
almost
cover
the
smell
the
smell
also
seems
to
have
a
sweet
orange
smell
as
well
the
hop
smell
appears
to
be
floral
the
taste
is
a
bit
different
than
the
smell
the
taste
tends
to
have
all
of
the
same
notes
but
in
different
degrees
in
the
taste
the
rye
notes
are
much
stronger
as
are
the
sweet
orange
notes
the
sweetness
normally
associated
with
bocks
is
really
down
in
comparison
the
floral
and
orange
hop
notes
are
still
present
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
on
the
thicker
side
despite
the
biting
carbonation
the
feel
is
smooth
but
fluffy
at
the
same
time
overall
a
decent
attempt
at
a
hybrid
bock
and
while
it
does
succeed
to
an
extent
the
bock
part
of
the
beer
seems
to
suffer
quite
a
bit
however
i
would
still
recommend
trying
at
least
one
o
enjoyable
like
liquid
bread
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
overall
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
while
not
terribly
complex
is
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
tasty
lager
that
pulls
in
some
elements
from
wide
ranging
styles
but
this
really
isnt
a
bock
a
solid
take
on
the
base
style
with
a
distinct
american
twist
very
much
in
line
with
the
pedigree
of
the
breweries
involved
a
good
start
to
the
12pack
o
i
have
reached
the
halfway
point
in
the
beer
camp
pack
and
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
another
tasty
brew
here
pours
a
clear
dark
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
rye
earth
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
earth
rye
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
balance
of
rye
and
citrus
forward
hops
that
is
slightly
better
in
the
smell
to
me
huge
creamy
head
over
a
golden
beer
persistent
with
sheets
of
lace
very
attractive
smells
of
citrus
earth
spice
taste
is
creamy
caramel
citrus
and
earth
toffee
a
distinct
zing
of
rye
spiciness
very
lightly
sweet
medium
body
is
mildly
carbonated
clean
finish
very
good
body
very
good
mouthfeel
its
strong
enough
7

that
the
alcohol
is
present
without
being
terribly
hot
very
easy
to
drink
not
bad
not
great
in
the
meh
category
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
again
this
pours
out
a
dark
copper
amber
with
a
substantial
inchthick
headit
falls
a
little
but
leaves
great
lacing
behind
aroma
has
a
lot
of
grassy
flowery
hop
scent
and
some
identifiable
rye
pepperiness
great
malt
flavor
complex
with
notes
of
bread
crusts
along
with
spicy
rye
bitterness
is
moderate
in
the
maibock
range
finish
is
rather
dry
for
the
the
general
bock
style
but
perfectly
good
for
this
hybrid
this
a
fine
fine
beer
possibly
the
best
in
the
collection
so
far
for
me
12oz
can
fresh
pour
thick
amber
with
some
orange
and
red
hints
head
is
not
gone
in
30
seconds
smells
of
pecan
spice
candied
sugar
rye
and
grain
taste
is
quite
sweet
plum
wine
flavor
with
hints
of
spice
and
hops
this
beer
has
floral
hop
tones
and
a
fairly
boozy
bock
style
fruit
character
here
with
the
hop
profile
the
rye
is
barely
on
the
nose
and
palate
and
rounds
out
the
booze
and
light
body
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
hops
on
the
back
of
the
mouth
pair
with
pretzels
smoked
trout
smoked
sausages
and
horseradish
this
rye
bock
was
a
really
nice
beer
the
appearance
was
very
nice
with
a
hazy
dark
yellow
hue
and
a
nice
fizzy
head
the
smell
had
great
amounts
of
rye
and
malt
to
make
a
fresh
bread
smell
with
some
citrus
hidden
underneath
the
taste
was
fantastic
with
those
bread
flavors
being
front
and
center
to
make
a
full
flavored
beer
that
still
had
subtlety
to
the
bear
sweetness
in
the
beginning
and
finishing
with
mellow
earthy
tones
through
out
would
highly
recommend
o
out
of
the
two
bocks
in
the
pack
this
is
clearly
the
better
nothing
super
impressive
but
its
flavorful
and
goes
down
easy
the
beer
works
it
way
through
a
series
of
flavor
experiments
that
begin
with
the
rye
grain
and
malts
become
vaguely
peppery
and
spicy
and
end
moderately
bitter
with
a
dry
finish
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
clean
maltiness
with
plenty
of
rye
strange
but
okay
o
i
wasnt
thrilled
with
this
one
it
wasnt
bad
but
im
fine
with
just
the
one
even
if
it
was
available
on
its
own
i
wouldnt
come
back
to
it
again
overall
delicious
beer
not
sure
it
really
fits
as
a
bock
stylewise
but
american
craft
is
gonna
do
its
own
thing
frankly
drinks
closer
to
your
average
modern
pale
than
anything
the
other
can
in
the
sn
mix
pack
and
frankly
both
were
pretty
close
in
flavor
with
the
rye
being
the
big
difference
12
ounce
can
part
of
the
beer
camp
across
america
12pack
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
copperorange
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
very
light
the
brew
smells
like
rye
toffee
and
some
fruit
berries
light
citrus
it
tastes
like
bready
malt
apples
spicy
rye
candied
oranges
and
also
a
weird
slightly
metallic
bitter
flavor
that
isnt
exactly
pleasing
unfortunately
the
taste
only
gets
worse
the
longer
i
drink
it
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
has
moderate
carbonation
it
seems
to
me
that
something
is
definitely
off
with
this
brew
problem
is
im
not
going
to
buy
another
case
just
to
see
if
this
was
a
bad
can
or
not
but
if
i
come
across
a
single
somewhere
ill
try
it
again
overall
4
0
great
brew
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
rye
bocks
but
this
one
was
excellent
the
addition
of
tropical
hops
was
a
stroke
of
genius
hoping
that
the
brewers
of
oskar
blues
and
sierra
nevada
can
get
together
and
put
this
one
out
on
a
regular
basis

give
this
beer
credit
for
its
uniqueness
i
give
sn
and
ob
credit
for
the
same
i
wouldnt
have
wanted
a
12pack
with
a
bunch
of
boring
the
lightest
bock
i
ever
had
but
i
enjoyed
it
a
suitable
bock
nothing
special
the
way
beer
should
be
you
guys
can
keep
your
overrated
fancy
beers
just
keep
the
bock
flowing
for
me
shiner
bock
is
basically
texas
personified
into
a
beverage
good
beer
if
you
havent
tried
it
yet
then
do
so
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
great
beer
the
best
to
me
12oz
bottle
poured
in
a
pint
glass
a
rather
light
bock
beer
with
a
dark
amber
translucent
body
and
smallmedium
head
smells
of
a
balance
of
malts
and
grain
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
alcohol
taste
mostly
to
the
sweet
malts
side
tending
afterward
to
a
slightly
bitter
bite
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
mostly
smooth
clean
and
refreshing
with
medium
crispness
and
carbonation
overall
a
drinkable
brew
for
an
everyday
beer
but
nothing
special
shiner
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
decent
beer
better
than
your
bud
lights
and
keystone
but
nothing
great
this
is
not
a
bock
its
more
of
a
flavored
water
it
reminds
me
of
a
waterd
down
abbey
no
flavors
stick
out
and
what
flavor
there
is
is
stale
and
weak
if
you
like
something
like
this
then
enjoy
if
youre
a
bock
fan
skip
this
12
oz
bottle
drank
as
part
of
a
bjcp
tasting
group
category
5
bock
on
01142015
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
and
drank
over
1530
minutes
really
nice
chocolate
flavor
not
ooverpowering
very
good
beer
excellent
bbq
beer
with
a
great
feel
dont
think
i
would
drink
it
any
other
time
though
nice
good
all
around
bock
very
understated
almost
watery
it
would
be
exceptional
with
sushi
or
spicy
food
to
clear
the
palate
i
dont
prefer
it
for
sipping
on
its
own
mediocre
beer
pouring
it
into
a
glass
and
letting
it
sit
for
a
little
bit
improves
on
the
flavor
and
smell
but
not
by
enough
to
where
id
call
it
good
stuff
spend
your
money
elsewhere
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
flat
flavor
slight
sour
taste
stale
finish
a
little
pepper
on
there
tongue
auburn
pour
with
thin
white
head
not
much
aroma
semi
sweet
malt
body
lite
mouthfeel
overall
a
lite
easy
to
drink
beer
on
a
hot
texas
nothing
is
finer
than
a
cold
shiner
texas
yuengling
but
not
as
good
very
bland
and
flat
just
a
slighty
flavorful
amber
lager
fairly
middle
of
the
road
no
off
flavors
not
too
watery
but
nothing
spectacular
either
while
i
prefer
heavier
ales
if
im
going
to
have
a
bock
this
is
the
one
not
bad
not
great
very
light
and
watery
i
do
like
most
beer
from
shiner
i
generally
have
liked
the
shiner
beers
they
are
all
decent
for
each
style
bock
is
no
different
i
liked
it
but
i
am
not
the
best
critic
of
of
this
style
i
can
see
how
some
rate
this
really
low
and
some
like
it
a
lot
flavors
are
good
but
not
strong
its
worth
a
try
and
you
will
probably
get
more
if
you
like
this
style
tastes
like
it
should
and
pretty
solid
at
that
horrible
is
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
27
home
bottle
i
liked
the
taste
and
feel
of
this
beer
liked
the
hops
and
this
beer
had
some
kick
and
was
pleasant
dark
goldbrown
color
crystal
clear
with
a
decent
head
that
disappates
quickly
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
full
of
bread
and
malt
flavor
is
malt
forward
obviously
with
very
light
hop
as
this
style
should
mouthfeel
is
good
cool
with
great
balanced
carbonation
ok
overall
but
nothing
exciting
12
oz
bottle
from
cost
plus
clear
dark
brown
color
with
a
head
that
thins
out
quick
mild
malt
aroma
taste
is
of
sweet
bready
malt
up
front
with
a
crisp
lager
taste
in
the
middle
leaving
a
lingering
sweetness
after
its
gone
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
bitterness
or
explosive
flavor
but
its
not
supposed
to
i
found
this
to
be
an
excellent
drinkable
basic
lager
beer
love
the
4
4
abv
very
average
beer
at
best
overall
this
beer
is
not
world
class
excellent
or
even
great
its
just
a
damn
solid
damn
good
beer
and
i
love
it
its
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
and
a
bottle
or
two
are
always
in
my
fridge
some
toasted
grain
and
a
little
caramel
and
toffee
on
the
nose
then
the
taste
follows
nothing
too
exciting
or
subtle
but
it
drinks
okay
and
in
the
midst
of
a
winter
move
its
refreshing
and
tasty
enough
a
good
solid
beer
nothing
fancy
but
i
try
to
keep
a
few
stocked
up
in
the
beer
fridge
this
beer
will
fool
you
it
has
a
nice
looking
amber
color
from
a
distance
very
appealing
just
no
flavor
one
of
my
favorites
good
solid
nonmacro
beer
pours
light
brown
with
largebubbled
head
which
disappears
completely
aroma
is
malty
bready
and
pleasant
no
bad
flavors
more
malt
caramel
and
bread
very
light
not
complex
but
really
not
bad
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
not
complain
o
decent
bock
but
nothing
great
its
not
as
good
as
some
proclaim
maybe
not
as
bad
as
some
might
say
i
havent
had
this
in
at
least
4
years
id
be
fine
waiting
that
long
again
you
cant
be
from
austin
and
not
allow
for
shiner
pours
a
clear
brown
producing
1
finger
of
foamy
khaki
shortlived
head
that
leaves
only
little
streaks
motes
of
lace
aroma
is
weak
thin
being
toasted
biscuit
malt
with
caramel
hints
of
roasted
nuts
toffee
floral
hops
very
faint
vanilla
taste
is
slightly
more
robust
being
of
toasty
dark
malts
caramel
biscuit
roasted
nuts
earthy
floral
hops
that
provide
a
slightly
lopsided
balance
peppery
spice
more
caramel
in
the
finish
roast
a
little
bitterness
in
the
dry
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
low
side
of
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
smooth
with
a
slight
prickle
juicy
wet
with
a
dry
aftertaste
the
most
redeeming
quality
of
this
brew
is
its
drinkability
what
it
lacks
in
aroma
and
flavor
it
somewhat
makes
up
for
by
going
down
easy
overall
reminded
me
of
miller
high
life
minus
the
heavy
carbonation
honestly
id
rather
have
an
old
milwaukee
pbr
etc
pours
a
deep
clear
brown
thinking
mahogany
but
with
almost
no
head
by
the
time
i
get
it
at
the
table
not
even
a
hint
the
aroma
is
barely
there
with
nothing
distinct
the
taste
is
a
little
better
with
a
caramel
malt
flavor
but
its
not
very
robust
the
body
does
has
have
a
decent
weight
and
feel
to
it
but
it
lacks
carbonation
not
sure
what
all
the
raves
for
this
beer
in
texas
are
about
looks
good
pours
fair
smells
fair
and
tastes
watered
down
with
little
to
no
carbonation
not
something
i
would
seek
out
a
great
example
of
what
a
bock
is
supposed
to
look
and
taste
like
it
is
a
dark
amber
color
the
smell
is
full
and
the
taste
is
outstanding
just
the
right
amount
of
caramel
left
to
linger
hits
you
like
a
ton
of
bliss
v
medium
value
its
certainly
not
the
cheapest
beer
but
its
not
ridiculous
either
right
in
the
middle
beer
has
very
little
character
little
caramel
in
the
after
taste
but
not
altogether
pleasing
shiner
bock
has
been
and
likely
will
remain
my
favorite
beer
for
most
activities
its
strong
yet
slightly
sweet
an
very
drinkable
nature
make
it
the
perfect
companion
for
most
outdoor
activities
but
it
feels
most
at
home
paired
with
tailgating
and
a
good
ribeye
the
spoetzl
brewerys
most
famous
offering
is
the
best
example
of
an
americanstyle
bock
it
doesnt
have
the
strength
of
its
german
counterparts
but
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
throughout
the
day
overall
its
hard
to
knock
shiner
bock
cant
believe
that
this
cold
be
a
flagship
beer
for
a
sizable
brewer
this
stinks
typically
i
will
fight
through
a
bad
beer
to
give
it
s
chance
but
it
never
improved
drain
pour
very
good
one
of
my
go
to
beers
o
shiner
bock
was
i
believe
the
first
beer
i
had
that
wasnt
massproduced
american
lager
so
it
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
it
is
very
basic
but
not
at
all
a
bad
beer
its
been
dumbed
down
a
bit
from
a
traditional
bock
and
is
a
bit
thin
but
still
a
solid
brew
this
beer
goes
well
with
pizza
dont
understand
the
hype
around
this
beer
yuengling
blows
shiner
out
of
the
water
as
far
as
overhyped
beers
go
tasted
cheap
and
not
delicious
not
sure
why
the
folks
in
texas
like
this
so
much
overall
nice
simple
approachable
beer
it
hasnt
got
much
in
the
way
of
hop
bitterness
or
explosive
flavor
but
its
crisp
and
enjoyable
i
paired
it
with
latkes
and
matzah
ball
soup
on
the
first
night
of
hanukkah
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
solid
beer
on
the
less
expensive
side
of
things
the
yuengling
for
people
in
pennsylvania
who
are
too
cool
to
drink
yuengling
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
this
one
is
that
it
has
a
nice
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
color
is
not
bad
either
a
solid
dark
brown
however
the
taste
is
not
so
flavorful
its
a
pretty
watery
and
light
tasting
beer
with
a
slightly
creamy
finish
towards
the
end
of
the
drink
not
a
terrible
beer
and
certainly
not
the
worst
ive
ever
had
i
would
not
rule
this
one
out
forever
however
will
not
actively
seek
it
out
baby
got
bock
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
price
i
paid
8
for
the
six
pack
and
i
have
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
i
will
not
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
again
overall
well
its
a
very
tepid
bock
with
very
little
to
make
it
shine
no
pun
intended
i
was
underwhelmed
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
sorry
texas
this
one
just
doesnt
cut
it
great
with
tacos
shiner
is
a
texas
standard
not
the
best
and
not
the
worst
it
is
nice
that
it
is
in
the
northeast
now
so
i
can
have
a
part
of
home
when
i
want
a
very
sessionable
beer
mild
flavor
and
aroma
body
is
very
attractive
with
the
sun
shining
through
but
the
lack
of
lacing
is
detrimental
overall
as
stated
earlier
not
much
excitement
drinking
this
beer
one
of
if
not
the
most
mediocre
bock
beer
ive
ever
had
bland
light
bodied
and
boring
you
wont
be
missing
much
by
passing
on
this
beer
trust
me
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
from
the
liquor
store
its
a
lot
like
drinking
brown
water
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
in
it
theres
no
taste
whatsoever
i
will
never
buy
beer
from
shiner
again
not
craft
beer
in
any
way
shape
or
form
a
decent
enough
beer
though
it
comes
across
rather
weak
in
all
areas
for
a
bock
beer
its
especially
odd
to
have
such
a
relatively
low
abv
for
a
bock
styled
beer
this
would
make
a
pretty
respectable
amber
lager
or
vienna
lager
but
lacks
the
oomph
and
appeal
of
a
classic
bock
beer
its
roasted
grain
and
nutty
flavors
are
a
plus
and
makes
the
beer
enjoyable
enough
for
what
it
offers
pours
a
dark
copper
with
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
and
predictably
no
lacing
left
along
the
glass
smell
is
malty
sweet
and
slightly
grainyastringent
taste
is
also
malty
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
does
have
a
toasted
lager
feel
to
it
a
step
up
from
a
traditional
basic
american
lager
but
i
cant
see
myself
reaching
for
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
session
just
not
much
noteworthy
about
it
its
a
slightly
above
average
its
pretty
watery
but
its
got
a
tad
more
flavor
than
an
american
lager
very
drinkable
the
price
is
usually
right
this
beer
tastes
as
if
it
was
mixed
with
keystone
light
no
bock
taste
what
a
waste
of
12
decent
taste
and
drinkability
great
choice
for
when
ya
aint
feelin
snooty
i
like
it
wont
win
any
awards
but
its
good
as
is
one
of
my
favorite
mass
produced
bock
beers
smooth
taste
without
being
too
bitter
if
you
like
bock
beers
and
you
cant
find
your
micro
brew
of
choice
this
one
will
do
just
fine
definitely
my
favorite
to
pick
up
at
the
local
store
and
keep
on
ice
at
home
mouthfeel
very
crisp
lightmedium
to
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
medium
high
carbonation
level
the
finish
is
very
sweet
and
mouthwatering
leaving
me
wanting
more
not
a
bad
bock
like
an
old
friend
its
always
there
at
least
in
texas
overall
far
from
the
robustness
of
a
true
bock
more
of
an
amber
lager
light
and
drinkable
with
a
bit
of
malt
character
a
nice
bock
i
think
there
a
better
bocks
out
the
for
the
money
a
good
beer
a
lager
with
more
character
than
most
but
still
very
smooth
and
drinkable
not
cheap
but
not
expensive
either
middle
of
the
road
in
terms
of
price
and
quality
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
character
that
is
better
than
many
others
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
it
has
a
darkish
redbrown
color
to
it
but
it
drinks
very
smooth
and
lighter
than
it
looks
not
much
aftertaste
good
beer
overall
middle
of
the
road
bock
easy
drinking
and
light
but
too
light
and
easy
drinking
for
me
excellent
taste
nice
rich
flavour
cant
ever
go
wrong
with
shiner
an
ok
beer
just
doesnt
have
any
real
bock
beer
flavor
malts
i
had
this
beer
while
i
lived
in
texas
a
local
favourite
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
this
may
have
been
considered
a
tasty
beer
premicrobrew
era
but
nowadays
it
is
only
slightly
more
interesting
than
the
big
name
lagers
good
if
you
wanna
consume
en
masse
at
a
party
o
if
i
found
a
relatively
cheap
case
of
shiner
bock
i
would
not
be
opposed
to
drinking
a
plethora
of
them
in
one
sitting
hence
the
drinkability
but
for
the
beer
nerds
and
connoisseurs
out
there
i
would
not
seek
out
this
beer
over
some
of
the
other
options
worth
trying
but
nothing
spectacular
great
beer
the
taste
tends
to
bring
out
the
malty
sweet
notes
more
than
anything
with
only
the
slightest
bitter
finish
it
tastes
like
something
from
the
1960s
overall
judging
this
beer
as
a
bock
will
give
it
very
low
scores
but
this
beer
is
a
great
lager
for
warm
days
tailgates
and
hanging
with
friends
its
easy
drinking
and
quite
enjoyable
if
this
is
priced
the
same
as
macro
beers
than
this
is
great
but
i
really
dont
like
shiner
trying
to
market
itself
for
more
than
what
it
really
is
i
always
pass
it
up
if
its
more
than
89six
pack
or
more
than
1312pack
overall
3
5
yeah
id
buy
it
again
its
not
bad
i
always
pour
my
beer
into
glasses
now
anyways
and
this
one
tastes
much
better
poured
a
decent
beer
although
not
really
an
appropriate
representation
of
a
traditional
bock
still
good
a
great
lager
to
have
try
it
o
quite
a
bit
darker
and
more
hefty
than
i
thought
the
hops
and
the
carbonation
really
have
to
fight
to
keep
it
from
becoming
cloying
and
syrupy
a
decent
beer
at
best
at
its
price
point
i
dont
think
it
will
compete
well
here
in
ma
interesting
decision
to
enter
such
a
saturated
market
especially
riding
right
on
the
coattails
of
yuengling
cheers
what
a
shame
this
beer
needs
a
rewind
o
not
terribly
exciting
as
far
as
bocks
go
o
a
decent
brew
but
disappointing
overall
i
expected
more
texans
cannot
brew
beer
yuck
yet
they
act
like
shiner
is
gods
gift
to
the
earth
the
beer
is
obviously
dyed
shiner
beer
doesnt
stack
up
to
even
your
most
common
domestic
beer
save
yourself
the
trouble
dont
buy
shiner
unless
you
like
beer
that
tastes
like
syrup
mixed
with
stale
bud
light
notes
the
love
for
this
beer
in
texas
explains
a
lot
about
the
state
get
into
an
argument
with
a
texan
and
theyll
tell
you
how
much
better
than
bud
it
is
like
thats
an
achievement
that
nobody
else
has
reached
and
cant
be
topped
but
hey
maybe
in
texas
being
slightly
better
than
the
worst
macro
swill
american
lager
is
something
to
be
proud
of
o
i
know
people
talk
down
on
beers
like
this
but
its
a
pretty
good
mellow
brew
its
got
way
more
flavor
and
body
than
your
run
of
the
mill
macrobrew
its
like
a
microbrew
version
of
a
light
beer
its
got
a
great
finish
and
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
if
you
live
in
texas
you
know
shiner
you
know
that
there
are
worse
things
to
find
in
a
fridge
at
a
party
or
any
type
of
gathering
if
you
want
something
solid
shiner
bock
will
not
disappoint
it
may
not
be
the
most
spectacular
beer
on
the
planet
or
even
something
you
should
drive
to
texas
specifically
to
find
but
if
you
walk
into
a
party
and
the
fridgecooler
is
stocked
with
miller
bud
coors
and
shiner
reach
for
the
shiner
every
single
time
and
you
will
not
be
upset
about
your
choice
this
is
the
beer
featured
in
country
songs
smoothest
amber
bock
beer
you
can
get
under

a
sixxer
poors
a
good
amber
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
mouthfeel
is
great
and
smells
of
hops
and
grains
tastes
like
texas
you
show
up
at
a
party
drinking
this
stuff
and
your
guaranteed
to
get
laid
this
stuff
is
great
shiner
premium
is
also
good
to
try
anything
shiner
is
good
minus
the
farmhouse
ale
dont
drink
that
crap
shiner
is
guaranteed
to
make
you
a
badass
get
you
laid
and
put

on

reduced
to

non

film
taste
is
rather
bland
and
bready
leaves
an
odd
alkaline
aftertaste
but
not
unpleasant
really
nothing
like
i
expected
it
goes
well
with
foodesp
beef
jerky
or
by
itself
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
texas
summer
day
overall
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
bock
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
at
least
this
beer
is
a
dark
beer
but
it
is
not
too
dark
it
gos
down
smooth
it
has
a
some
what
heavy
taste
but
not
too
heavy
if
you
like
dark
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
to
buy
the
smell
is
really
good
as
well
the
smell
is
not
too
strong
or
too
weak
this
beer
is
a
good
beer
for
just
sitting
back
and
relaxing
around
the
house
it
is
also
a
good
beer
for
out
at
a
bar
with
friends
or
at
dinner
i
would
recomend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
dark
beer
or
to
someone
who
likes
to
try
new
beers
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
know
that
i
will
have
this
beer
again
with
no
problem
so
i
would
recommend
that
anyone
who
likes
dark
beer
shpuld
go
out
and
have
a
shiner
bock
i
do
not
believe
that
you
could
go
wrong
with
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
in
color
with
about
a
12finger
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
spotty
lacing
as
well
the
aroma
is
a
faint
sweetness
with
malt
carbonation
is
a
bit
under
average
taste
is
of
a
light
sweet
caramel
malts
unlike
many
other
bocks
goes
down
pretty
easy
with
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
actually
wasnt
that
bad
and
would
have
one
again
overall
2
25
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
entirely
too
watery
and
sweet
and
unfitting
for
the
style
the
aroma
and
taste
of
the
beer
are
just
right
for
my
liking
i
would
like
to
add
that
i
only
like
this
beer
cold
or
near
to
it
it
is
not
pleasant
when
it
begins
to
warm
up
welcome
to
ct
on
tap
at
2
bros
pours
a
translucent
reddish
copper
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
zero
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
and
bready
with
some
light
caramel
notes
maybe
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
more
of
the
bready
malts
with
some
caramel
and
light
orange
peel
malty
finish
with
some
light
nuttiness
very
light
mouthfeel
for
the
style
thin
this
is
a
decent
easy
drinking
bock
but
it
is
certainly
not
going
to
replace
gansett
bock
as
my
goto
in
that
category
overall
alright
o
sadly
this
is
a
not
a
bock
this
is
a
dark
colored
watered
down
pilsner
it
is
missing
the
medium
range
abv
the
girth
in
terms
of
body
and
more
profound
malt
characteristics
down
the
drain
shiner
products
just
became
available
in
my
area
though
i
had
tried
some
in
wyoming
a
year
or
two
ago
while
this
beer
has
little
in
common
with
any
german
or
microbrewed
bock
that
ive
tried
it
may
harken
back
to
american
bocks
that
came
out
seasonally
way
back
in
the
day
quite
a
bit
darker
and
a
little
sweeter
than
the
average
pale
brew
with
perhaps
a
tiny
bit
more
alcohol
not
what
i
was
expecting
after
years
of
being
a
southern
thing
along
with
fat
tire
shiner
bock
has
finally
come
up
to
ct
there
was
a
lot
of
hype
surrounding
this
beer
and
when
i
tried
it
it
was
hard
not
to
be
let
down
it
was
thin
for
a
bock
with
the
smell
of
the
wheat
and
a
little
grapefruit
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
similarly
thin
although
very
refreshing
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
altogether
forgettable
altogether
this
is
a
nice
beer
which
tastes
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
it
isnt
all
that
particularly
special
but
its
a
hell
of
a
lot
nicer
than
what
youd
expect
from
most
large
american
breweries
definitely
something
worth
having
on
hand
for
just
about
any
situation
as
a
texan
i
have
a
special
affinity
for
shiner
and
the
spoetzl
brewery
shiner
bock
is
what
turned
me
onto
dark
beers
and
it
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorites
so
good
and
popular
that
anheuserbusch
had
to
copy
it
with
their
ziegen
bock
it
is
in
my
opinion
the
beer
of
texas
final
notes
it
could
do
with
some
better
carbonation
after
a
decent
pour
it
went
flat
in
only
a
few
minutes
no
bubbles
even
from
an
etched
glass
its
sweetness
and
low
hops
might
make
it
a
good
braising
beer
ill
have
to
give
it
a
go
i
have
developed
a
taste
for
texas
beers
and
the
spoetzl
brewery
does
make
some
outstanding
beers
it
pours
clean
with
a
dark
amber
color
with
white
laces
that
lead
up
to
a
fluffy
head
that
dissipates
pretty
fast
it
has
a
malt
taste
blended
with
hops
and
has
traces
of
metal
corn
sweet
and
wheat
tastes
it
is
smooth
with
malt
after
taste
and
is
somewhat
filling
for
a
better
consumption
drink
it
cool
not
cold
pours
a
nice
brown
with
pillowy
head
that
quickly
recedes
minimal
aroma
so
not
much
to
talk
about
there
i
think
this
beer
is
often
served
too
cold
and
that
obscures
its
taste
and
texture
i
definitely
let
some
of
the
chill
off
from
pulling
it
out
of
the
display
case
at
the
package
store
and
drink
it
cool
but
not
cold
this
beer
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
with
a
hint
of
hoppiness
i
would
love
it
to
be
a
bit
thicker
and
maltier
though
the
mouth
feel
is
very
nice
smooth
and
satiny
again
serve
it
too
cold
and
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
attributes
disappear
this
excellent
beer
has
a
deep
amber
almost
copper
color
and
has
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
not
overwhelming
in
fact
is
very
subtle
the
taste
is
absolutely
sublime
not
overpowering
not
too
hoppy
not
bitter
it
is
perfectly
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
this
has
been
my
alltime
favorite
beer
for
quite
some
time
its
very
hard
to
beat
this
beer
shiner
bock
has
been
a
favorite
for
a
long
time
but
i
admit
it
can
be
a
mix
bag
some
batches
appear
to
be
better
than
others
it
seems
the
amount
of
dimethyl
cooked
cabbage
ranges
from
mild
to
a
lot
get
a
good
one
and
you
have
a
nice
german
amber
lager
it
is
always
a
beautiful
clear
amber
theres
never
too
much
happening
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
toast
caramel
dimethyl
no
hop
presence
here
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
but
but
still
has
some
smooth
creaminess
and
is
not
overly
carbonated
a
great
session
beer
that
beats
mass
market
cheap
stuff
in
every
way
a
decent
beer
nothing
particularly
exciting
but
easy
drinking
and
pleasant
short
review
for
a
beer
that
doesnt
require
a
long
one
its
a
beer
that
just
it
is
what
it
is
affordable
decent
nothingatallspecial
beer
sweet
quite
thin
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
very
interest
piquing
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
overall
not
an
okay
beer
but
not
the
worst
ive
had
overall
had
this
on
tap
at
a
steakhouse
it
was
served
in
a
frosted
mug
from
a
draft
and
i
was
actually
blown
away
by
how
good
it
was
picked
up
a
sixer
and
the
beer
is
refreshing
but
just
ok
that
said
i
believe
this
beer
is
best
served
very
cold
for
my
next
one
i
have
it
in
the
snowbank
and
im
gonna
drink
it
right
before
it
freezes
o
despite
scoring
weakly
in
most
categories
shiner
bock
is
in
fact
an
okay
brew
its
very
disappointing
considering
it
sports
the
bock
name
but
i
guess
it
could
hold
its
own
against
some
american
dark
lagers
its
definitely
light
years
ahead
of
most
of
the
bmc
offerings
its
not
something
id
drink
for
the
pleasure
of
its
consumption
but
i
wouldnt
object
to
mindlessly
pounding
down
a
few
pints
on
gameday
with
some
friends
i
used
to
seek
out
this
beer
on
visits
to
texas
and
loved
it
better
in
my
memory
than
in
in
my
review
o
whenever
i
just
want
a
lighter
refreshing
beer
to
drink
i
usually
go
for
the
lighter
lagers
shiner
works
for
this
its
not
my
favorite
style
of
lager
but
its
not
bad
at
all
it
is
good
for
the
money
nice
beer
overall
pass
o
not
enough
body
too
much
carbonation
simple
flavor
not
impressed
i
have
seen
this
beer
numerous
times
in
the
grocery
store
and
finally
decided
to
pick
up
a
single
12
ounce
bottle
i
wouldnt
get
this
beer
again
its
very
bland
doesnt
offer
much
of
a
taste
this
beer
doesnt
offer
a
bad
taste
just
not
much
of
a
taste
at
all
quaffable
yet
underwhelming
it
has
some
bock
characteristic
but
doesnt
pack
enough
punch
to
suit
the
palate
of
the
craft
beer
generation
shiner
bock
25
overall
this
beer
flows
like
water
in
the
great
state
of
texas
so
its
gotta
be
light
and
tame
enough
to
be
enjoyed
by
all
sure
beats
the
bmc
lagers
overall
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
not
to
much
depth
to
the
flavor
though
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
if
it
was
an
american
light
bock
not
sure
how
old
this
beer
might
be
but
it
is
the
first
time
found
in
my
area
of
the
country
so
i
must
assume
it
is
fresh
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
off
white
head
that
persists
forever
aromas
of
light
sweet
pilsner
malt
caramel
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
light
earthy
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
more
dark
macro
than
bock
honestly
light
sweet
maltiness
with
a
heavy
overtone
of
caramel
and
faint
earthy
hop
bitterness
little
to
no
hop
flavor
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
easy
enough
to
drink
and
really
nothing
flawed
here
its
a
bit
sweet
and
could
use
some
melanoids
well
at
least
this
helped
to
get
me
thinking
beyond
cookie
cutter
macros
all
those
years
ago

i
can
see
as
a
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
you
could
clear
off
a
couple
of
sixers
of
these
and
still
manage
your
8x
tablees
but
nothing
to
the
beer
really
doesnt
taste
terrible
just
bland
overall
just
average
maybe
slightly
below
worth
a
try
if
you
dont
have
any
expectations
i
didnt
will
not
repurchase
had
straight
from
bottle
so
just
giving
a
mid
level
appearance
here
easy
drinking
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
for
a
cheap
price
dark
malts
some
sweet
molasses
and
a
slight
adjunct
lager
aftertaste
easy
drinking
and
a
good
alternative
to
the
macros
at
a
bbq
certainly
worth
drinking
with
plenty
of
dark
malt
flavor
to
feed
the
taste
buds
not
bad
easy
drinking
american
beer
that
tastes
like
it
is
from
a
big
brewery
it
will
work
with
a
burger
but
dont
bring
it
out
to
impress
friends
o
i
want
to
like
it
but
it
is
just
too
sugary
sweet
for
me
o
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
its
not
all
that
great
either
as
uninspired
as
it
is
its
super
drinkable
even
as
it
warms
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
gateway
beers
for
me
growing
up
in
texas
i
thought
shiner
was
the
endall
beall
for
beer
maybe
its
gotten
worse
or
maybe
my
taste
buds
have
matured
either
way
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
anymore
still
it
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
and
is
definitely
a
step
or
two
above
the
macros
overall
doesnt
even
rate
meh
o
its
not
bad
in
gulps
but
this
is
not
a
sippin
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
12
oz
plastic
cup
lovely
light
brown
color
no
head
at
all
just
some
attractive
lacing
little
aroma
at
all
flavor
is
disappointing
onedimensional
little
bitterness
no
detectable
hops
flavor
mouth
feel
is
thin
overall
a
timid
and
uninteresting
brew
i
wont
be
trying
it
again
ive
never
sampled
anything
by
the
spoetzl
nrewery
before
i
hope
this
is
not
their
best
i
appreciate
that
spoetzl
is
the
oldest
in
brewery
in
texas
and
that
shiner
bock
is
its
longeststanding
brand
but
i
dont
understand
the
appeal
nor
how
the
brewery
became
one
of
the
top
ten
largest
craft
beer
producers
in
america
on
the
back
of
such
a
bland
flagship
recipe
high
c
o
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
would
do
as
a
beer
to
gulp
down
at
the
bowling
alley
o
quite
comparable
to
genesee
bock
if
not
a
half
notch
below
it
easy
to
drink
if
you
want
to
have
multiples
overall
my
favorite
beer
for
barbecuing
especially
brisket
this
beer
is
best
served
ice
cold
with
ribs
or
texas
style
barbecue
overall
its
not
bad
but
it
gave
me
heartburn
o
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
when
you
want
to
have
a
session
beer
and
dont
want
to
settle
for
a
bmc
it
definitely
has
more
flavor
than
the
macro
beers
but
they
arent
very
memorable
i
suppose
its
a
good
beer
to
give
to
a
friend
or
relative
who
is
looking
into
craft
beers
but
is
not
ready
for
something
like
stone
laguanitas
or
sam
adams
for
what
it
is
its
an
okay
beer
this
is
my
first
review
it
goes
down
so
smooth
and
easy
and
is
a
good
session
beer
at
a
fair
price
the
initial
smell
made
me
immediately
think
back
to
college
and
had
me
worried
at
first
taste
wise
it
was
no
where
near
as
bad
as
that
first
sniff
made
me
think
itd
be
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
few
steam
beers
that
ive
had
its
nowhere
near
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
its
a
lot
better
than
drinking
anything
red
white
and
blue
i
could
definitely
session
these
i
bought
a
6
of
it
on
a
business
trip
to
east
texas
where
i
dont
actually
think
craftmicro
beer
exists
best
stuff
ive
seen
is
sam
and
goose
island
and
figured
id
give
a
locally
brewed
texas
beer
a
try
im
pleased
with
it
overall
and
would
definitely
buy
it
again
o
a
tasty
american
bock
to
drink
while
waiting
for
the
release
of
genny
bock
ive
got
a
couple
good
buddies
who
feel
like
i
do
so
you
beer
snobs
can
have
your
beer
that
no
one
can
find
spell
or
stomach
ill
take
a
shiner
bock
and
im
not
even
from
texas
o
not
my
favorite
shiner
but
drinkable
and
refreshing
better
than
a
lot
of
other
common
beers
now
i
have
to
level
set
for
the
rest
of
the
49
states
that
get
shiner
weeksmonths
after
it
was
made
ive
toured
the
shiner
brewery
and
can
certainly
attest
to
the
affects
of
harsh
storing
and
shipping
condition
on
beer
i
have
had
the
flat
bitter
watery
shiner
bock
that
has
been
reviewed
and
i
have
also
tasted
the
sweet
texas
tea
that
is
shiner
bock
hoursdays
after
the
factory
brewed
it
do
not
blame
the
brewery
or
the
beer
for
the
failings
of
time
and
mishandling
of
man
firstly
shiner
bock
is
no
where
near
hoppy
it
is
a
sweet
as
far
as
beers
go
blend
of
yeast
malt
and
hops
we
sure
do
make
bread
with
it
down
here
the
deep
caramel
color
is
a
clear
indicator
of
taste
it
is
not
intended
to
be
be
an
overbearing
weigh
you
down
alcoholic
bock
it
is
refined
for
drinkability
and
sweet
sipping
again
think
iced
tea
its
certainly
not
a
heavy
headed
brew
that
and
does
not
pretend
to
be
an
exotic
concoction
of
ingredients
that
blend
together
to
make
a
disappointing
offputting
flavor
sam
adams
boston
lager
comes
to
mind
take
the
traditional
german
respect
for
bier
and
an
american
sensibility
for
drinkability
and
crave
for
refreshing
flavors
and
you
have
shiner
bock
i
can
use
apply
all
the
adjectives
and
similes
for
the
look
but
taste
is
he
only
thing
that
matters
id
happily
drink
a
shiner
instead
of
a
snobby
craft
beer
placed
on
a
pedestal
that
tastes
like
bathroom
soap
if
you
notice
the
score
i
didnt
say
it
was
perfect
due
to
the
varying
environments
consistency
ive
tasted
it
in
but
it
is
good
when
its
good
why
is
this
rating
an
outlier
shiner
bock
pours
a
blackish
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
aroma
malts
and
garbage
the
taste
is
similar
to
eat
a
pile
of
cat
litter
rather
pitiful
watery
and
weak
flavors
prb
a
good
thing
overall
nearly
a
drain
pour
weak
and
horrible
flavors
but
at
least
it
pours
nice
o
drinks
pretty
easy
tastes
better
in
a
bottle
cold
versus
a
pint
glass
would
not
seek
out
in
the
store
but
would
drink
it
over
a
standard
light
beer
at
a
social
gathering
absent
other
options
overall
although
it
lacks
in
aroma
and
has
a
mediocre
appearance
the
taste
of
the
brew
makes
up
for
it
it
is
smooth
with
a
slight
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
drink
not
the
best
beer
but
great
upgrade
from
your
standard
brews
to
good
health
and
good
beer
overall
frustrating
beer
because
it
has
little
taste
at
all
thirstquenching
yes
enjoyable
hardly
looking
forward
to
tying
more
shiner
beers
heavy
enough
for
my
stout
partial
tastes
but
light
enough
it
wont
fill
me
up
after
a
few
o
eh
id
put
it
on
par
with
yuengling
the
problem
here
though
is
that
its
a
craft
beer
that
tastes
like
a
macro
which
is
never
good
additional
points
taken
off
for
giving
me
a
bit
of
a
headache
overall
a
good
summer
beer
that
is
simple
and
refreshing
a
good
candidate
for
a
session
beer
if
you
dont
want
to
overload
your
palate
with
anything
intense
a
good
beer
for
noncraft
drinkers
at
a
party
or
event
to
broaden
peoples
horizons
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
seeing
you
here
in
the
big
city
im
sure
glad
to
see
you
but
im
not
sure
i
really
want
to
bring
you
to
any
parties
maybe
we
can
hang
out
the
next
time
were
both
back
in
tx
here
a
beer
to
enjoy
i
could
drink
this
everyday
when
some
say
it
pours
in
to
glass
and
nothing
happens
there
right
a
beer
that
need
nothing
fancy
to
enjoy
it
just
pour
and
drink
i
like
the
color
i
like
the
taste
i
like
the
botttle
drink
it
looks
good
in
a
glass
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
smells
of
caramelized
malt
with
not
much
else
tastes
of
fruit
and
some
malt
but
still
watery
beer
is
definitely
sessionable
but
is
light
for
a
bock
overall
an
average
beer
o
not
a
standout
bock
though
also
not
deserving
of
the
brutal
reviews
it
here
take
it
for
what
it
is
a
step
up
from
the
macors
and
something
other
than
a
pale
ale
overall
this
may
be
the
most
overrated
beer
ever
everyone
in
beer
circles
has
heard
of
shiner
bock
and
i
guess
if
youve
only
had
bud
light
your
whole
life
this
would
be
a
welcome
change
but
its
not
a
very
good
beer
i
needed
doritos
to
finish
the
bottle
because
i
couldnt
drink
it
straight
sweet
malt
up
front
bready
a
little
toasted
and
caramel
notes
hop
bitterness
is
minimal
crisp
and
clean
finish
body
is
light
clean
crisp
refreshing
semi
dry
sharp
carbonation
o
a
better
than
average
session
beer
especially
for
picnics
and
backyard
bbqs
but
nothing
special
overall
in
surprised
at
how
poor
this
is
i
remembered
it
10
years
ago
as
being
a
decent
beer
it
goes
down
fast
and
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
hang
onto
will
never
buy
it
again
as
american
made
bocks
go
which
by
and
large
isnt
saying
much
this
one
isnt
really
all
that
bad
and
its
a
whole
lot
better
than
some
of
the
other
shiner
brews
its
got
a
sweetness
to
it
thats
only
mild
and
the
darker
malts
give
it
some
reasonable
depth
of
both
smell
and
taste
its
got
a
roasted
character
that
teams
up
well
with
the
molasses
like
sweetness
the
yeast
is
a
little
out
of
place
her
i
think
not
sure
what
they
used
but
its
off
furthermore
you
cant
have
a
darker
bock
under
5
abv
it
just
doesnt
do
the
style
justice
and
it
doesnt
work
for
me
that
being
said
though
there
are
no
offensive
flavors
here
and
this
beer
is
actually
pretty
drinkable
in
a
bar
where
miller
and
coors
products
are
my
only
option
except
this
i
will
go
back
to
it
again
and
again
plenty
of
room
fro
improvement
and
its
a
far
cry
from
the
german
traditional
but
in
the
right
context
this
can
be
very
enjoyable
just
not
even
close
style
wise
big
disappointment
when
i
drink
a
bock
i
want
sweet
malt
this
just
tastes
cheap
it
didnt
pour
with
a
lot
of
head
retention
but
the
overall
color
and
clarity
were
good
it
has
very
little
aroma
mostly
of
crystal
malt
with
little
to
no
hop
aroma
the
flavor
is
the
best
part
rich
caramel
flavor
with
a
clean
crisp
lagered
finish
very
easy
to
drink
the
mouthfeel
was
average
for
this
type
of
beer
i
would
definately
drink
one
of
these
again
if
i
had
my
choice
over
having
to
drink
coors
or
bud
light
definately
a
better
choice
the
feel
is
easy
and
light
but
not
too
carbonated
very
light
easy
drink
but
very
little
complexity
in
this
brew
o
although
there
is
some
character
to
it
unlike
most
of
shiners
other
beers
its
still
a
dud
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
serving
type
ive
had
this
on
bottle
on
tap
and
after
touring
the
shiner
brewery
in
shiner
texas
drink
sometimes
you
only
drink
something
because
it
was
free
and
you
hadnt
reviewed
it
this
was
one
of
those
really
an
adjunct
but
a
good
go
to
beer
when
youre
thirsty
this
is
not
the
finest
or
best
bock
beer
around
in
my
travels
i
think
shiners
goal
here
is
to
produce
a
sessionable
bock
beer
which
in
my
opinion
is
i
have
had
many
of
these
over
the
years
and
come
back
on
occasions
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
decent
with
bbq
meats
and
beef
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
but
a
very
light
bodied
bock
watery
to
me
maybe
a
dark
lager
to
some
nothing
worth
seeking
out
unless
you
just
have
to
try
it
overall
this
has
been
my
goto
beer
for
any
occasion
it
is
very
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
and
is
highly
recommended
tho
try
on
draft
as
well
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
offwhite
head
good
retention
on
a
clear
deep
copper
body
suddsy
lacing
aroma
includes
a
caramel
sweetness
and
maybe
a
touch
of
raisin
and
molasses
taste
is
dominated
by
caramel
malt
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
again
raisins
very
very
easy
beer
to
drink
over
and
over
a
beefy
american
macro
lager
with
amber
color
meh
o
decent
enough
but
5
bottle
was
way
too
much
for
what
it
is
meh
deep
copper
white
head
has
little
retention
and
some
lacing
tastes
and
smell
are
of
sweet
bread
and
caramel
some
grains
minimal
hop
bitterness
stays
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
touch
of
metallic
astringency
feels
light
decent
carbonation
finishes
with
a
bit
of
residual
sweetness
not
bad
fairly
straightforward
and
simple
drinkable
this
is
a
work
in
progress
this
beer
is
clearly
just
a
dark
lager
almost
bmc
but
without
the
off
tastes
its
well
made
consistent
and
good
quality
a
great
beer
to
get
people
into
craft
beer
and
a
great
session
beer
o
decent
beer
high
drinkability
not
anything
to
write
home
about
medium
bodied
at
best
somewhat
drying
sharp
effervescence
up
front
fades
fast
this
one
is
for
the
drain
not
alcohol
abuse
its
palate
protection
overall
while
the
flavors
are
decent
the
look
feel
and
aroma
are
not
the
greatest
just
alright
shiner
bock
often
appears
on
menus
in
small
restaurants
as
the
only
alternative
to
standard
american
macro
lagers
e
g
budweiser
miller
and
coors
if
you
find
yourself
seated
in
such
a
restaurant
and
must
have
a
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
order
a
miller

mouthfeel
this
medium
bodied
beer
is
easy
drinking
like
it
should
be
and
that
semi
sweet
finish
it
is
good
and
the
best
buy
at
a
gas
station
the
only
two
beers
i
enjoy
better
are
belhaven
and
yeunglingwhich
its
strangely
similar
too
odoh
so
boring
when
there
is
only
bud
and
miller
around
this
is
a
much
better
option
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
doesnt
sit
to
heavy
no
bitterness
to
be
found
just
a
good
beer
not
great
and
certainly
doesnt
carry
the
cool
factor
now
that
there
are
so
many
craft
breweries
out
there
but
im
always
satisfied
after
drinking
it
o
not
that
good
for
a
bock
its
rather
weak
and
suspiciously
adjunct
like
as
a
dark
lager
this
would
fare
well
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
at
the
price
it
goes
for
that
is
all
overall
not
the
best
but
still
pretty
good
compared
to
other
high
price
ambers
d
doesnt
really
achieve
the
richness
robustness
of
a
true
bock
more
a
still
easy
to
quaff
brew
with
a
decent
bit
of
bockesque
flavor
o
completely
forgetable
nice
packaging
but
poor
product
something
about
this
beer
is
off
putting
i
just
dont
like
it
and
will
never
look
for
it
again
made
the
mistake
of
getting
two
six
packs
of
this
stuff
cheers
i
used
to
have
this
occasionally
in
missouri
it
is
not
too
common
up
here
in
minnesota
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
if
you
want
something
different
tasting
than
a
pale
lager
not
too
strong
so
you
can
have
a
few
of
them
in
a
sitting
nothing
too
special
here
shiner
bock
is
a
great
goingout
beer
in
a
poolhall
with
the
buds
or
a
strip
club
whatever
the
setting
its
a
great
beer
to
grill
with
both
to
marinade
and
to
drink
while
you
cook
shiner
is
the
beer
of
texas
and
not
without
good
reason
grab
a
6er
and
try
it
out
next
time
you
throw
a
grill
on
and
see
what
i
mean
id
alway
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
but
i
didnt
like
it
at
all
o
it
was
not
bad
but
i
would
not
drink
it
again
i
dont
like
the
strong
finish
at
all
body
is
medium
at
best
maybe
a
bit
light
for
the
style
carbonation
is
medium
and
somewhat
crisp
drinks
clean
and
easy
so
theres
that
and
i
can
see
how
this
might
be
appealing
in
the
texas
heat
but
it
falls
short
of
satisfying
my
malty
cravings
when
i
reach
for
a
bock
and
isnt
something
id
reach
for
again
if
faced
with
any
of
the
superior
bottles
on
the
shelf
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
here
a
bit
of
a
boring
onedimensional
brew
on
the
other
hand
its
completely
inoffensive
would
put
in
in
the
something
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
handed
to
me
for
free
but
wont
seek
outpay
for
class
overall
there
really
isnt
much
too
this
one
very
drinkable
but
very
simple
and
not
at
all
memorable
o
while
ive
had
a
number
of
these
over
the
years
i
hadnt
had
one
in
at
least
5
years
and
my
expectations
were
not
high
so
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
an
above
average
beer
thats
highly
drinkable
o
clean
drinking
for
those
who
want
to
keep
things
light
on
a
hot
summer
day
mindless
downer
wont
wow
but
perhaps
a
gateway
beer
for
your
bmc
buddies
minimal
hop
presence
shouldnt
offend
a
bock
more
like
a
pale
lager
or
blonde
boring
color
of
a
burnt
yellow
with
a
1
finger
off
white
head
and
lacing
tad
on
the
taste
side
of
caramel
and
real
malty
was
ice
cold
for
all
of
about
30
seconds
terrible
mouth
feel
and
flow
bad
after
taste
slow
to
no
carbonation
depletion
very
bad
all
around
o
i
really
dont
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
its
drinkable
especially
straight
from
the
bottle
but
there
are
so
many
better
choices
for
the
same
price
this
beer
is
horribly
unimpressive
and
boring
but
at
least
its
not
offensive
lawnmower
beer
but
carbonation
is
too
much
like
diet
soda
not
a
good
thing
otherwise
palatable
but
generally
uninteresting
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
presentation
of
the
style
it
was
flavorful
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
the
appearance
of
this
is
dark
caramel
brown
with
no
head
whatsoever
and
what
appears
like
tons
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
slightly
funky
slightly
sweet
slightly
caramel
and
slightly
nothing
the
flavor
is
weak
and
not
very
bock
like
the
flavor
is
well
weak
for
a
bock
it
isnt
a
bad
flavor
it
just
isnt
much
of
a
bock
it
mimics
the
smell
and
appearance
the
mf
is
higher
carbed
than
i
would
like
and
i
think
of
the
style
and
thin
and
watery
overall
this
is
a
beer
a
bock
i
am
sure
that
it
is
but
not
a
great
one
i
either
had
a
bad
bottle
or
i
just
dont
like
it
i
know
this
doesnt
have
a
very
good
rating
but
im
not
sure
why
its
actually
one
of
the
best
macro
style
brews
i
ever
had
its
has
some
malty
flavor
and
maybe
even
a
munich
style
lager
flavor
i
just
wish
the
abv
was
a
bit
higher
but
other
than
that
its
probably
a
nice
safety
brew
in
a
pinch
overall
not
a
bad
brew
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
grilling
overall
its
not
bad
but
it
really
isnt
a
good
representation
of
the
style
going
by
style
guidelines
alone
this
is
a
big
miss
but
i
kind
of
enjoyed
it
and
preferred
it
to
the
macros
available
at
the
function
i
was
attending
give
it
a
try
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
notes
not
a
good
beer
o
shiner
bock
seems
to
me
like
a
decent
session
beer
though
i
still
think
full
sails
session
series
is
a
far
better
choice
but
i
would
leave
the
compliments
at
that
i
suppose
the
only
reason
im
so
harsh
on
shiner
is
that
i
remembered
this
beer
tasting
good
once
and
now
im
left
with
this
sort
of
bockadjunct
hybrid
that
makes
my
tongue
shrivel
i
hope
this
is
just
a
bad
batch
and
that
the
next
time
i
try
this
beer
it
performs
a
little
better
2
0
this
was
difficult
because
i
used
to
drink
shiner
all
the
time
years
ago
when
i
lived
in
corpus
christi
because
it
was
the
only
beer
with
some
flavor
to
it
its
a
caramel
colored
american
lager
with
a
little
less
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
o
not
quite
the
best
beer
the
shiner
puts
out
still
better
than
most
other
readily
available
beers
overall
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
nothing
too
interesting
either
to
call
this
a
safe
beer
seems
an
appropriate
term
pours
a
medium
dark
brown
with
no
foam
light
malty
smell
kind
of
a
sweeter
caramel
smell
light
sweet
malt
taste
a
little
bland
and
with
no
carbonation
mild
and
uneventful
some
cola
flavor
in
there
just
enough
bubbles
to
let
you
know
its
not
the
wort
but
just
ok
at
best
very
watery
mouthfeel
with
too
low
of
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
i
guess
its
got
a
fine
body
to
it
the
beer
has
a
sweet
mouthfeel
but
the
hop
character
clashes
with
it
overall
this
beer
is
a
pretty
pathetic
bock
its
not
tasty
at
all
i
feel
like
padma
lakshmi
when
she
was
tentatively
drinking
shiner
bock
on
season
9
of
top
chef
i
feel
you
padma
i
feel
you
o
overall
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
i
enjoy
quite
a
bit
nothing
earth
shattering
by
any
means
but
its
something
that
makes
me
smile
and
i
find
myself
drinking
it
more
than
any
other
brew
o
an
easy
drinking
everyday
version
of
a
bock
in
all
actuality
not
very
good
but
simple
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
exceptional
pairs
well
with
texas
style
bbq
quite
sessionable
pours
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
aroma
or
roasted
malts
is
present
but
it
is
not
a
strong
aroma
the
malt
flavor
is
pretty
mild
and
the
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
the
hops
flavor
is
pretty
mild
like
the
blonde
it
does
not
leave
much
lacing
behind
it
is
still
an
average
beer
but
i
remember
knocking
back
quite
a
few
of
these
years
ago
overall
this
a
mild
average
bock
could
use
some
more
caramel
flavor
but
the
bitterness
was
ok
shit
sucks
o
this
beer
is
bad
very
bland
and
disappointing
highly
not
recommended
not
a
bad
session
beer
o
pretty
light
bodied
little
aroma
and
little
flavor
overall
average
beer
at
best
definitely
want
more
flavor
than
shiner
bock
delivers
poured
this
bock
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
bock
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
produced
a
very
thin
off
white
head
and
it
disappeared
instantly
poor
head
retention
the
aroma
consists
of
some
malted
grain
and
not
much
else
no
hops
any
other
scent
to
speak
of
medium
in
body
this
bock
features
some
toasted
grain
flavor
just
a
slight
hint
of
sweet
caramel
not
much
to
get
excited
about
here
i
guess
i
would
prefer
this
to
say
abs
amber
bock
not
a
bad
brew
to
try
once
prost
overall
a
joke
not
worth
a
drink
i
seen
this
beer
all
the
time
just
grabbed
one
bottle
to
try
thought
it
was
a
classic
just
a
poorly
made
cheap
bock
not
worth
the
time
to
drink
overall
its
good
to
wash
food
down
doesnt
leave
any
terrible
tastes
in
your
mouth
probably
would
be
worth
the
money
if
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
overall
im
a
bit
let
down
i
have
only
been
drinking
good
beer
for
about
6
months
so
i
am
not
familiar
with
everything
and
i
saw
this
while
buying
a
mix
and
match
6
pack
and
saw
it
was
a
bock
other
bocks
have
really
been
awesome
experiences
this
one
is
just
not
but
other
than
that
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
is
pretty
pleasing
to
the
palate
give
it
a
try
and
compare
it
to
other
bocks
listen
i
think
shiner
bock
is
an
american
classic
it
tastes
just
like
itself
and
is
very
easy
on
the
palate
but
its
distinctive
despite
the
easiness
now
it
may
not
look
or
smell
like
anything
special
its
certainly
not
a
textbook
bock
what
it
is
is
a
hell
of
a
good
session
beer
hop
flavor
isnt
what
distinguishes
this
its
the
grainy
malted
carbonation
its
got
its
own
zing
that
isnt
bitter
or
citrusy
just
a
good
mediumbodied
lager
with
modest
alcohol
content
im
more
than
likely
going
to
have
this
again
overall
id
rather
buy
yuengling
or
red
oak
amber
lager
to
achieve
this
taste
i
would
not
purchase
it
again
o
no
hate
to
the
brewers
or
to
the
fans
but
i
advise
fans
of
quality
brews
to
stay
far
away
from
this
beer
seriously
ive
had
this
one
on
tap
before
and
it
tasted
and
smelled
much
better
than
the
bottled
version
overall
this
is
best
described
as
a
malty
american
adjunct
that
disappoints
especially
on
the
palate
with
the
feel
not
far
behind
i
really
hope
that
this
is
not
anyones
introduction
to
the
bock
style
look
ill
drink
a
shiner
bock
if
im
at
a
restaurant
and
its
that
or
a
bmc
but
theres
just
not
a
lot
going
on
here
too
bad
texas
restaurants
often
carry
this
in
lieu
of
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
overall
grade
cd
onot
too
bad
of
a
beer
i
dont
think
it
deserves
its
poor
rating
certainly
much
better
than
any
bmc
and
easily
findable
are
there
better
beers
out
there
hell
yes
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
and
priced
reasonably
i
havent
had
one
of
these
in
a
long
time
and
i
always
remembered
it
being
better
than
this
not
sure
if
this
is
one
i
will
seek
out
again
as
there
are
better
beers
available
for
a
similar
price
overall
i
can
detect
no
off
flavors
or
smells
so
this
is
crafted
rather
well
but
not
as
tasty
as
class
offerings
of
the
style
not
as
bad
to
drain
pour
though
so
i
can
finish
the
other
3
rather
easy
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
its
not
great
either
i
like
the
color
of
the
beer
but
its
virtually
headless
o
average
in
every
sense
of
the
word
a
forgettable
beer
but
its
widely
available
in
areas
in
my
state
that
traditionally
only
sell
bmc
d
its
certainly
drinkable
but
id
pass
on
this
boring
beer
a
thin
tan
head
settles
quickly
on
top
of
a
reddish
brown
body
leaving
no
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
both
very
caramel
forward
not
much
else
once
again
shiner
produces
a
thin
watery
over
carbonated
beer
overall
not
excited
as
some
with
this
beer
goes
down
quick
and
smooth
just
doesnt
offer
much
for
flavor
other
than
being
a
malt
bomb
once
again
i
would
like
to
see
some
hops
to
cut
thru
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
sadly
there
was
no
wow
factor
that
made
me
want
this
beer
it
was
just
far
too
week
for
my
tastes
if
you
want
something
rather
cheap
go
for
it
otherwise
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
to
suit
your
needs
i
dont
think
of
shiner
bock
as
a
bockin
the
technical
beerstyle
sense
its
lighter
in
color
lighter
in
flavor
and
lightered
bodied
than
a
salvator
or
any
other
beer
faithful
to
the
style
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
bad
or
good
point
is
shiner
bock
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
have
a
lovehate
relationship
with
sometimes
it
hits
the
spotand
ill
take
a
shiner
over
bmc
anytimebut
sometimes
i
just
plain
dont
care
for
it
so
there
could
quaff
this
but
would
rather
you
know
drink
something
good
overall
there
is
nothing
great
about
this
beer
but
there
is
nothing
bad
either
its
pretty
good
it
is
the
beer
that
texas
kids
drink
when
they
want
to
act
like
they
are
having
a
less
mainstream
style
beer
without
actually
having
to
put
up
with
anything
to
strong
hey
thats
their
choice
and
i
would
be
lying
if
i
wasnt
thankful
that
people
bring
beers
like
this
instead
of
just
bud
light
to
parties
extremely
bland
and
extremely
pointless
its
barely
above
the
watery
nothingness
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
bock
yeah
just
fuck
the
hell
off
in
the
end
this
beer
wasnt
a
shitty
beer
at
all
and
im
not
saying
it
was
im
just
not
into
this
style
give
it
a
try
for
yourself
i
know
that
shiner
is
a
respectable
lable
and
they
put
out
more
then
a
few
great
beers
the
color
is
a
light
brown
color
kinda
like
iced
tea
the
foamy
head
dissipates
quickly
although
refreshing
though
nose
is
very
mild
mostly
malt
has
a
slight
grain
smell
and
little
else
its
a
nice
beer
for
taking
to
the
lake
or
camping
will
drink
again
though
i
supposed
you
could
have
quite
a

of

you
liked

because
the
abv
is

and
the
density
is

overall
an
odd
review
paradoxical
in
its
what
you
seesmell
is
not
what
you
get
varietyand
thats
quite
alrightwhen
a
bock
is
not
judged
by
its
cover
or
as
a
bock
when
its
limited
by
the
state
of
texas
in
its
alcohol
contentclearly
a
win
for
us
all
this
beer
is
incredibly
wet
and
watery
for
a
bock
it
has
practically
no
flavor
and
just
feels
completely
flat
easy
drinking
yes
but
pretty
darn
boring
someone
hand
me
a
sam
adams
winter
lager
at
least
d
a
light
bodied
beer
with
some
good
crystal
malt
flavors
pretty
easy
to
find
texasmade
brew
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
average
overall
o
underwhelmed
by
this
one
there
are
far
better
bocks
out
there
if
i
was
in
a
shitty
bar
somewhere
and
didnt
like
their
beer
selection
it
is
possible
they
might
still
have
this
and
it
may
still
be
cheap
on
the
wallet
so
i
would
go
with
that
over
the
other
major
domestics
id
rather
have
a
celebrator
i
know
not
a
regular
bock
but
these
were
on
sale
at
11
for
a
12
pack
id
consider
that
a
fair
price
for
this
brew
overall
drinkability
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
it
was
much
more
flavorful
must
be
a
flat
keg
bad
lines
or
maybe
a
false
memory
not
sure
why
its
so
watery
compared
to
my
memory
overall
have
had
better
bocks
not
bad
but
nothing
special
overall
i
use
to
drink
this
all
the
time
when
i
started
to
get
into
craft
beers
i
usually
get
this
beer
for
a
party
because
it
doesnt
offend
anybody
and
is
very
cheap
12
pack
for
11
dollars
i
dont
really
care
much
for
it
now
but
it
is
what
it
is
12
oz
bottle
pours
dark
amber
with
a
small
short
lived
offwhite
head
and
slight
carbonation
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
caramel
and
some
grassy
hops
light
slightly
crisp
body
not
much
flavors
are
going
on
the
palate
some
bready
malt
and
light
hops
drinkable
but
forgettable
brew
overall
shiner
bock
is
a
basic
but
enjoyable
dark
larger
that
quenches
the
thirst
without
making
you
think
too
much
pretty
decent
for
what
it
is
i
would
quaff
this
at
a
party
no
problem
poured
vigorously
into
a
pint
glass
got
a
1
inch
head
that
almost
instantly
dissipated
the
color
is
brown
but
very
clear
i
detected
a
faint
slight
sweet
smell
but
mixed
with
metallic
odor
was
not
so
appealing
the
taste
was
very
light
metallic
with
a
slightly
nutty
sweetness
but
very
bland
not
matching
the
color
the
mouthfeel
is
slight
carbonation
no
real
impressiveness
there
i
find
this
overall
to
be
not
terrible
compared
to
other
macro
lagers
but
not
great
i
am
somewhat
disappointed
overall
impression
since
living
in
texas
i
havent
enjoyed
a
shiner
bock
in
quite
some
time
i
have
to
say
there
is
some
actually
character
to
this
one
some
of
the
categories
dont
fit
the
bock
style
but
i
have
to
say
this
one
is
one
hell
of
a
brew
very
malty
and
has
a
nice
honeycaramel
aroma
and
taste
throughout
will
be
enjoying
again
o
i
guess
this
beer
could
be
refreshing
but
you
have
a
lot
better
options
out
there
worth
trying
because
its
a
classic
but
dont
buy
more
than
one
soso
sessionable
brew
not
as
good
as
yeungling
but
better
than
the
macros
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
either
o
im
sure
if
i
were
in
a
crappy
texas
bar
and
this
were
my
only
choice
outside
of
the
usual
bland
yellow
lagers
i
would
take
it
that
however
is
not
a
compliment
to
this
beer
has
nothing
remotely
in
common
with
a
real
bock
i
think
ill
avoid
this
one
from
this
point
forward
would
not
buy
it
again
o
not
a
beer
i
would
consider
among
the
best
but
i
like
it
and
definitely
appreciate
its
ubiquity
in
texas
o
finished
the
bottle
and
i
could
probably
do
it
again
but
there
are
many
beers
id
drink
first
not
overly
pleasant
to
any
of
the
senses
o
overall
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
nice
balance
i
bought
this
beer
in
washington
d
c
because
i
was
in
a
terrible
beer
store
and
this
was
the
only
thing
on
the
shelf
that
i
hadnt
already
tried
maybe
i
should
have
stuck
with
something
else
its
not
terrible
but
its
a
stretch
to
call
it
a
bock
i
prefer
shiner
in
a
can
over
a
bottle
and
from
the
tap
but
all
are
good
overall
a
great
beer
this
is
my
daily
beer
great
flavor
and
not
overpowering
o
finally
get
to
try
this
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
makes
for
a
good
session
brew
although
this
beer
is
marketed
as
a
bock
it
is
closer
in
style
to
a
vienna
lager
relatively
low
in
alcohol
and
taste
the
opposite
of
a
proper
bock
this
beer
is
nevertheless
refreshing
with
a
meal
and
a
definite
step
up
from
the
usual
bigname
american
beers
in
texas
it
is
almost
as
widely
available
as
budweiser
making
it
a
good
goto
beer
in
situations
where
no
true
microbrews
are
available
side
note
shiners
labels
are
pretty
entertaining
and
informative
i
especially
liked
the
ram
on
the
cap
of
this
one
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
almost
had
no
flavor
i
thought
it
looked
great
when
the
bartender
brought
me
over
a
tasting
glass
but
was
very
surprised
to
taste
almost
nothing
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
very
light
and
almost
no
taste
notes
that
my
taste
buds
could
pick
up
honestly
this
was
a
sink
pour
after
drinking
about
a
quarter
of
it
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
american
bock
beer
brewed
in
texas
my
shiner
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
average
sized
head
that
dissipated
a
little
too
rapidly
for
me
it
has
a
robust
malty
flavor
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
and
good
carbonation
this
is
a
great
allpurpose
bock
beer
that
goes
good
with
barbques
and
other
meaty
dishes
i
dont
get
the
following
on
this
beer
i
must
be
a
bit
of
an
elitist
i
guess
this
is
a
great
bock
especially
for
one
thats
offered
year
round
this
is
a
great
allpurpose
beer
to
keep
on
hand
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
tower
of
americas
bar
in
san
antonio
it
was
a
dark
beer
with
a
light
taste
and
mild
flavor
it
didnt
have
a
lot
of
bite
i
live
in
new
york
and
our
community
beer
store
has
a
lot
of
imported
beers
from
around
the
world
but
this
one
i
cant
find
in
the
city
oobviously
not
a
world
class
beer
but
when
stuck
in
a
beer
wasteland
of
bmc
products
this
is
a
treat
its
very
crisp
and
something
that
can
be
easily
consumed
in
large
amounts
d
easy
drinker
smooth
tasting
lighter
bodied
brew
glad
i
had
tried
the
brew
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
d
poor
flavor
profile
and
thin
mouthfeel
make
one
more
than
enough
if
this
beer
werent
over
carbonated
and
had
just
a
slightly
more
robust
flavor
profile
it
would
be
a
really
decent
beer
as
it
stands
its
just
ok
o
hadnt
had
a
shiner
in
years
and
im
thinking
ill
take
another
break
still
this
has
so
often
been
an
oasis
of
a
tap
handle
at
a
dive
bar
just
as
it
wad
tonight
goes
down
well
while
kicking
back
and
viewing
hipster
antics
and
listening
to
bad
local
music
d
meh
pass
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
very
little
head
almost
no
carbonation
and
just
about
zero
lacing
the
smell
is
very
one
dimensional
to
me
wheat
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
and
an
odd
copper
smell
very
thin
nose
on
this
beer
the
taste
is
about
the
same
very
thin
uninteresting
and
not
worth
finishing
this
ones
a
drainpour
for
me
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
dry
and
definitely
on
the
thin
side
with
a
copper
aftertaste
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
you
can
do
a
lot
better
for
the
style
o
id
like
to
think
that
i
got
an
old
bottle
but
im
not
too
sure
if
i
am
looking
to
drink
a
bock
i
will
pass
on
this
in
texas
it
is
a
good
beer
and
can
be
had
inexpensively
almost
anywhere
outside
of
texas
i
would
say
to
avoid
it
many
of
the
people
here
know
this
it
is
a
shame
that
they
give
that
other
beer
the
same
name
do
with
such
a
low
abv
and
its
easy
drinkingness
its
no
wonder
why
this
is
so
popular
i
found
it
very
quaffable
the
beer
appeared
to
be
clear
slightly
darker
amber
than
expected
with
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
that
faded
in
a
matter
of
seconds
no
lacing
to
mention
but
some
noticeable
carbonation
floating
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
overall
pretty
weak
it
gave
off
a
very
light
bread
aroma
that
was
slightly
sweet
not
much
more
than
that
the
taste
was
pretty
well
as
expected
very
light
in
flavor
but
followed
the
nose
with
no
hops
to
mention
the
beer
was
light
in
the
mouth
carbonation
seemed
to
be
right
and
drinkability
was
on
par
with
other
beers
of
a
similar
nature
that
is
to
say
below
average
overall
while
better
than
the
likes
of
some
light
beers
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
have
often
and
more
than
likely
will
pick
something
else
if
i
see
it
on
tap
it
was
on
sale
at
the
grocery
store
and
i
hadnt
tried
it
yet
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
go
poured
the
first
one
not
much
head
at
all
smell
was
hoppy
and
metallic
with
some
toasty
notes
in
there
as
well
although
it
is
kind
of
dark
in
color
it
is
not
a
heavy
beer
and
its
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
sweet
toasted
and
nutty
with
some
hop
flavor
as
well
its
really
not
bad
more
than
i
expected
but
its
nothing
special
it
lacks
the
flavor
that
real
bocks
bring
to
the
table
and
has
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
but
it
tastes
pretty
good
and
is
light
enough
to
be
drinkable
so
i
cant
complain
overall
this
is
a
pretty
unimpressive
beer
its
not
undrinkable
but
it
doesnt
impress
the
flavor
profile
is
very
lacking
the
beer
comes
across
as
watery
and
not
very
complex
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
small
12
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
whatsoever
smell
is
of
bready
malt
only
pretty
one
dimensional
overall
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
with
only
a
biscuitlike
malt
flavor
coming
through
this
beer
has
a
very
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
effervescent
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
a
one
dimensional
smell
and
taste
brownishruby
colored
liquid
very
thin
off
white
head
no
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
smell
was
grainy
faint
fruity
smell
taste
was
bland
malty
but
not
enough
punch
thin
mouthfeel
very
disappointed
by
this
beer
given
its
popularity
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
not
terrible
overall
but
just
lacks
flavor
and
individuality
overall
this
was
less
than
impressive
and
rather
disappointing
my
money
can
be
better
spent
elsewhere
it
is
a
nice
beer
but
not
any
better
than
the
much
cheaper
yuengling
this
is
on
tap
just
about
everywhere
in
the
texas
panhandle
since
this
is
the
easiest
slightly
darker
non
american
adjunct
beer
to
find
here
i
drink
it
quite
a
bit
its
a
brownish
amber
copper
color
very
clear
with
a
whitish
head
which
goes
away
quickly
the
smell
is
faint
a
slight
sweetness
maltiness
very
little
to
no
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
with
some
decent
carbonation
the
taste
is
okay
you
get
mostly
some
maltiness
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
overall
this
beer
is
better
than
the
3
big
alternatives
but
ive
long
since
grown
tired
of
it
but
its
all
i
can
find
with
my
meals
so
i
still
order
it
while
hoping
to
find
someplace
which
at
least
has
guinness
or
sam
adams
on
tap
it
does
have
a
pretty
big
following
here
in
texas
its
the
super
popular
craft
beer
ive
read
somewhere
its
the
best
selling
beer
in
texas
i
almost
have
to
be
careful
not
to
let
people
i
know
see
this
review
they
might
feel
betrayed
pours
a
clear
auburn
color
with
little
to
no
head
a
little
yeasty
malt
on
the
nose
along
with
some
light
carmel
or
maybe
even
molasses
as
i
get
a
touch
of
smokey
edge
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
when
you
treat
it
as
a
bock
it
doesnt
really
hold
up
as
compared
to
a
more
serious
bock
beer
not
so
good
as
compared
to
other
american
amber
lagers
from
widely
available
brewers
not
bad
at
all
this
overall
has
the
qualities
of
a
macro
beer
but
its
definitely
better
than
bmc
id
probably
give
the
tap
version
a
try
if
i
ever
find
myself
in
tx
overall
glad
i
stole
this
tick
because
its
not
worth
paying
for
even
as
a
2
single
feels
good
on
the
tongue
with
an
almost
clean
finish
a
lot
of
drink
ability
for
a
bock
id
say
and
i
didnt
mind
its
muted
features
poured
a
clear
copperbrown
with
a
thin
white
head
pale
malts
in
the
nose
caramel
sweetness
basic
but
nice
lightly
toasted
malts
in
the
taste
with
notes
of
toffee
and
caramel
not
much
as
far
as
hops
goes
so
its
overall
sweet
but
lacking
a
good
balance
mediumlight
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
though
nothing
extraordinary
just
a
good
night
out
beer
this
beer
was
omnipresent
during
my
years
in
texas
and
ill
always
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
it
even
if
it
doesnt
stack
up
so
well
when
held
up
for
review
drinkablilty
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
really
complex
or
enjoyable
enough
for
me
to
seek
out
my
second
time
trying
out
of
bottle
was
really
not
much
better
then
tap
id
avoid
i
had
this
beer
at
cousins
bbq
at
the
dallas
airport
it
was
served
in
a
plastic
pint
cup
the
beer
was
medium
brown
in
color
with
a
sweet
aroma
the
beer
was
smooth
dry
a
little
bitter
and
metallic
taste
no
after
taste
at
all
best
texas
beer
i
have
had
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
better
than
i
remember
i
could
be
hallucinating
but
it
seems
to
have
gained
some
body
and
depth
of
flavor
since
i
last
tried
it
who
knows
its
been
a
awhile
in
any
case
the
pour
isnt
much
very
dark
maber
almost
chestnut
with
a
head
that
promises
much
but
fades
quickly
nicely
malty
and
nutty
in
the
aroma
with
some
toasted
grain
and
some
light
earthy
hop
aromas
on
the
finish
the
taste
has
some
more
of
that
toasted
grain
a
fair
bit
of
sweetness
and
some
cereal
grains
there
is
a
bit
of
grainy
slickness
and
slight
sourness
on
the
finish
but
the
nicely
toasty
notes
are
still
there
probably
suffers
more
in
the
mouthfeel
than
taste
from
these
defects
i
could
drink
this
ocassionally
overall
great
cheap
beer
for
cooling
off
in
the
texas
heat
overallone
more
beer
to
try
out
of
the
spoetzl
brewery
shiner
six
pack
thank
goodness
these
beers
suck
really
didnt
find
this
beer
appealing
at
all
it
was
plain
to
the
point
of
almost
being
undrinkable
simple
beers
can
be
very
good
but
to
be
honest
i
think
id
rather
drink
a
bud
light
i
will
not
buy
this
again
o
it
is
not
gonna
win
any
awards
but
in
texas
it
is
hot
this
is
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
goes
down
easy
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
not
much
of
a
head
on
initial
pour
and
what
there
was
dissipated
extremely
quickly
leaving
only
the
faintest
traces
of
foam
appearance
is
medium
deep
orangecopper
aroma
is
very
underwhelming
with
only
the
faintest
hint
of
hops
and
no
malt
notes
to
be
found
at
all
taste
is
very
similar
not
much
at
all
to
be
found
and
overall
quite
watery
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
of
an
improvement
with
a
bit
of
body
and
some
nice
tight
carbonation
present
overall
while
not
an
offensive
product
this
beer
left
quite
a
bit
to
be
desired
o
kinda
reminds
me
of
an
extremely
watered
down
sam
winter
i
would
not
try
again
but
is
a
session
beer
overall
pretty
much
how
i
remember
it
decent
especially
when
i
was
in
texas
and
it
was
this
or
bmc
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
also
very
overpriced
here
in
nj
i
would
put
it
on
par
with
yuengling
but
its
price
is
more
in
line
with
sierra
nevada
d
drinkable
maybe
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
with
so
many
craft
choices
here
not
going
with
this
novelty
again
shiner
bockmaybe
its
just
a
texas
thing
but
i
could
kick
it
back
all
day
nice
and
light
easy
to
drink
admittedly
out
of
line
for
a
bock
but
we
love
it
perfectly
hopped
for
enjoying
in
the
hot
texas
sun
and
with
a
nice
touch
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
great
with
a
generous
wedge
of
lemon
we
love
it
and
the
whole
world
would
to
if
they
could
get
their
hands
on
it
d
perfectly
fine
for
an
easy
to
obtain
convenience
store
beer
not
too
impressed
with
this
american
depiction
of
a
thoroughly
classic
european
style
lightbodied
thin
lacking
strong
aroma
nor
noticeable
flavor
easy
on
the
palate
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
particularly
recommended
pours
a
lightbrown
hue
with
minimal
foam
and
carbonation
not
a
very
wellrounded
beer
to
say
the
least
it
barely
has
any
scent
but
what
it
has
is
ok
it
also
is
well
crafted
it
does
not
have
any
offensive
taste
which
means
you
could
drink
a
few
and
not
get
sick
i
am
usually
looking
for
a
little
more
though
this
isnt
even
as
good
as
genny
bock
d
for
a
bock
the
flavors
are
rather
weak
its
a
good
introductory
beer
for
people
that
only
drink
bmc
especially
at
its
price
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
light
lager
than
a
bock
part
of
the
shiner
mixed
12
pack
really
liked
all
of
them
so
far
ive
actually
heard
of
this
beer
before
and
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
ill
try
anything
pours
a
reddishorange
color
not
much
going
on
in
the
aroma
department
very
little
carbonation
almost
seems
like
its
flat
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
rough
for
a
low
abv
beer
has
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
and
not
very
appealing
i
drink
the
two
bottles
in
the
box
but
would
never
purchase
this
on
its
own
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
but
definitely
not
a
good
one
by
any
means
bottom
line
is
it
horrible
not
at
all
it
has
some
metallic
notes
that
remind
me
of
canned
macro
it
is
for
sure
refreshing
and
if
i
had
it
in
cans
in
my
area
this
would
be
a
great
fishing
beer
for
when
i
am
on
the
illinois
river
on
my
dads
boat
o
pretty
average
in
my
opinion
i
had
this
a
couple
years
ago
with
bbq
in
austin
and
i
liked
it
then
this
time
when
actually
thinking
about
what
i
was
drinking
i
was
a
little
more
unimpressed
will
probably
have
again
in
the
future
somewhere
in
texas
but
i
wont
actively
seek
it
out
i
can
easily
rap
off
dozens
of
beers
that
are
worse
than
this
id
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
with
no
issues
i
guess
i
like
it
wondering
if
my
slender
euro
pint
was
making
this
easy
on
me
poured
a
darker
copper
color
with
just
a
small
amount
of
beige
head
on
it
smell
was
pretty
weak
some
caramel
malt
but
not
a
lot
going
on
here
taste
was
decent
but
again
was
a
little
on
the
weak
side
some
spice
along
with
the
malt
but
there
could
have
been
more
here
i
think
light
bodied
beer
that
went
down
pretty
easy
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
i
think
it
could
have
been
a
little
better
that
being
said
it
went
down
smooth
and
tasted
pretty
good
overall
d
a
bock
to
go
for
in
a
crunch
and
priced
approprietly
for
what
you
get
i
would
drink
a
few
in
a
party
setting
although
i
think
i
might
of
enjoyed
this
a
bit
more
from
a
can
overall
a
very
average
bock
nothing
to
write
home
about
clear
copper
chestnut
colored
with
a
low
beige
head
that
settles
quickly
low
aroma
of
toasty
malt
and
biscuit
flavors
of
toasty
malt
matched
with
moderate
bitterness
some
corny
notes
faint
caramel
thin
mouthfeel
a
bit
tingly
could
be
more
complex
a
beer
d
very
weak
bock
beer
move
along
there
is
nothing
to
see
or
taste
here
wish
this
was
a
greater
attempt
at
a
fine
style
not
worth
the
price
it
really
is
not
worth
the
price
it
usually
is
charged
for
by
retailers
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
nuttyauburnbrown
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
settles
into
a
quarter
inch
layer
of
foam
smells
were
very
muddled
but
i
got
hints
of
nutty
and
caramel
malty
aromas
round
malty
flavors
on
a
crisp
light
body
the
flavors
are
a
bit
underwhelming
and
i
could
pick
out
hazelnut
and
caramel
high
carbonation
makes
the
beer
sharp
on
the
tongue
and
the
flavors
are
a
bit
bland
for
the
body
and
style
there
is
a
light
malty
aftertaste
that
vanishes
quickly
the
finish
is
crisp
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
a
friend
in
college
told
me
this
was
his
favorite
beer
i
think
its
time
to
introduce
him
to
the
good
stuff
d
i
gave
a
four
cause
low
alcohol
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
d
because
of
the
smoothness
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
would
be
no
problem
to
go
through
a
six
pack
overall
it
is
an
average
beer
being
from
tx
i
can
drink
a
shiner
back
to
back
at
a
restaurant
where
all
they
serve
is
the
usual
nasty
lager
fare
but
i
wouldnt
pick
up
a
6pack
at
my
grocery
store
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
ive
had
my
share
of
this
beer
and
its
easy
to
go
through
a
six
pack
thats
probably
because
of
how
light
it
is
i
preferred
it
a
little
more
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
no
surprise
there
im
surprised
the
average
score
is
as
low
as
it
is
seems
like
a
decent
beer
to
me
d
an
easy
to
drink
beer
and
easy
to
session
but
it
just
is
a
subpar
beer
for
me
d
ive
had
this
on
tap
a
few
years
ago
and
it
was
better
but
still
not
great
d
this
is
very
macroesque
and
to
think
that
texans
swear
by
this
garbage
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
theres
not
too
much
to
the
nose
perhaps
just
light
carmel
malt
the
flavor
consists
of
slightly
sweet
carmel
and
its
slightly
bready
on
tap
it
drinks
just
fine
its
between
light
and
medium
in
body
and
also
features
good
carbonation
i
find
this
to
be
very
drinkable
and
im
not
even
a
fan
of
the
style
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
probably
because
its
the
first
micro
i
ever
actually
liked
probably
because
i
had
not
matured
my
palate
yet
it
has
a
wonderful
color
when
compared
to
the
usual
bud
coors
type
mass
produced
brews
its
quite
drinkable
and
many
times
ive
made
a
run
to
a
convenience
store
this
was
the
best
beer
there
i
was
happy
to
see
it
on
the
shelf
its
only
real
drawback
is
its
much
too
lite
for
my
stout
riddled
taste
buds
it
is
an
allaround
good
alternative
to
bud
bud
light
or
any
other
cheap
swill
this
beer
is
alright
its
the
beer
that
got
me
into
local
beers
shiner
bock
is
an
average
beer
a
beer
i
would
drink
before
anything
anbus
but
if
theyre
is
pretty
much
any
other
craft
brew
on
tap
i
would
take
it
over
this
it
has
a
relatively
low
alcohol
percentage
so
its
real
easy
to
get
down
and
its
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
all
in
all
its
okay
i
wish
they
put
more
effort
into
their
beers
notes
another
shiner
beer
that
i
was
underwhelmed
by
this
one
is
just
too
heavy
on
sweet
caramel
and
copper
metallic
flavors
nothing
that
i
would
seek
out
or
really
want
to
drink
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
wouldnt
buy
one
again
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
modest
beige
head
and
some
great
lacing
aroma
is
incredibly
sweet
with
whiffs
of
toffee
and
caramel
taste
is
a
little
watery
and
similar
to
yuengling
albeit
a
bit
heavier
very
much
like
artificial
maple
syrup
long
sweet
aftertaste
not
offensive
smooth
and
drinkable
but
this
is
not
a
bock
overall
somewhat
bland
in
taste
yet
refreshing
and
crisp
nonetheless
nothing
noteworthy
yet
it
would
be
a
nice
beer
for
me
to
add
as
a
summer
slammer
to
complement
the
couple
of
adjunks
that
i
prefer
i
personally
like
the
taste
of
the
beer
its
color
is
good
which
fits
its
taste
i
did
notice
after
a
while
that
it
has
been
pulled
from
tap
that
it
acquires
a
lack
of
a
better
word
a
buttery
taste
that
really
dosnt
go
good
with
anything
i
do
like
this
beer
and
im
not
bashing
it
the
buttery
taste
in
my
opinion
did
not
take
effect
until
thirty
or
so
minutes
after
pour
i
do
keep
some
in
my
fridge
i
have
shiner
before
to
make
burgers
with
which
turned
out
great
good
beer
for
beer
lovers
i
cant
say
this
was
a
favorite
poured
dark
brownish
with
a
white
head
smell
was
wheaty
as
was
the
taste
with
a
sort
of
watery
finish
cant
remember
much
of
the
smell
except
it
being
wheaty
nothing
great
about
it
taste
was
like
watered
down
wheat
toast
had
a
sort
of
thin
mouth
feel
not
a
very
fun
beer
and
hardly
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
get
though
the
light
alcohol
and
lack
of
a
strong
taste
might
make
it
good
for
session
drinking
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drink
for
me
this
was
a
slight
step
above
say
the
normal
bmc
line
up
no
problem
finishing
this
and
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
if
i
was
handed
one
but
i
dont
plan
on
buying
this
one
again
when
i
pay
a
premium
price
for
beer
i
expect
to
obtain
a
premium
beer
shiner
bock
is
a
serious
disappiontment
because
it
sits
beside
the
likes
of
sierra
nevada
and
sam
adams
i
should
have
bought
one
of
those
i
think
this
bock
is
just
on
the
edge
of
the
worthy
ones
but
stays
out
of
the
league
dont
think
ill
go
back
to
it
i
used
to
love
shiner
but
after
exploring
more
beers
this
is
becoming
less
of
a
favorite
i
can
now
taste
the
bad
water
quality
that
they
use
when
i
went
to
the
brewery
the
creek
that
ran
beside
the
place
was
dried
up
i
guess
that
south
texas
heat
just
does
not
help
with
beer
making
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
carbonated
and
fairly
pleasant
and
the
drinkability
is
just
about
average
theres
really
nothing
special
in
this
beer
its
just
a
step
up
from
bmc
swill
id
drink
one
if
offered
but
i
doubt
ill
be
purchasing
this
again
glad
i
only
got
a
single
as
far
as
mainstream
easily
available
bocks
go
leinies
1888
blows
this
out
of
the
water
got
this
in
a
trade
with
depechemode1983
thanks
man
pours
a
semi
transparent
ruddy
brown
color
maybe
better
described
as
maple
syrup
color
with
a
1in
offwhite
head
smells
of
bready
malt
and
slightly
of
alcohol
a
friend
told
me
they
use
rice
in
this
beer
i
think
i
can
smell
it
a
bit
taste
is
of
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
wheat
hops
the
finish
has
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
makes
you
want
another
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
i
know
many
others
dont
like
this
beer
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
as
a
bock
it
may
not
be
very
impressive
but
style
aside
this
beer
is
delicious
and
enjoyable
to
drink
at
4
4
abv
its
pretty
dang
sessionable
i
think
it
would
be
best
enjoyed
in
the
end
of
summer
and
during
fall
it
has
a
lot
more
taste
and
color
tha
your
average
apa
or
lawnmower
beer
but
its
still
not
so
overwhelming
that
isnt
refreshing
a
little
less
than
one
finger
of
very
light
brown
head
lace
was
a
little
lacking
on
cling
color
was
a
rich
medium
dark
amber
with
good
micro
bubble
action
smell
was
average
nothing
really
stood
out
aromas
of
roasted
wheat
malt
and
a
little
pine
taste
was
well
balanced
with
traces
of
wheat
corn
malt
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
refreshing
with
good
flavor
but
nothing
special
not
a
bad
price
for
a
beer
that
tastes
better
than
any
of
the
big
three
in
this
type
not
a
great
beer
but
here
in
texas
its
the
same
price
as
coors
light
at
a
bar
which
makes
it
great
value
for
the
money
when
youre
out
more
than
a
macro
but
not
much
more
perhaps
the
best
of
the
three
ive
had
so
far
which
isnt
saying
a
lot
still
i
could
see
drinking
this
again
if
youre
into
a
beer
with
a
earthy
flavor
this
beer
is
for
you
you
can
certainly
drink
a
lot
of
these
as
the
abv
is
under
5
but
would
you
really
want
to
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
better
in
texas
on
tap
then
in
kansas
out
of
a
bottle
it
is
a
wonderful
sessionable
beer
average
lager
at
best
but
at
8
50
a
sixer
around
here
one
can
do
much
better
the
flavor
is
moderately
creamy
from
the
malt
and
carbonation
that
is
high
in
the
mix
the
slight
sweet
essence
of
the
cornpops
is
there
with
slight
tinge
of
very
gentle
woody
qualities
not
sure
if
it
is
malt
or
hop
derived
with
a
slight
light
brown
sugar
element
the
finish
is
semidry
with
slight
slick
effect
on
the
palate
the
bock
is
ok
for
me
i
kind
of
enjoyed
it
with
some
deep
fried
appetizers
and
the
steak
it
was
paired
with
was
perfect
which
made
me
feel
the
beer
was
drinkable
in
the
setting
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
personally
but
if
no
other
options
are
available
it
is
ok
drinkability
is
solid
if
nothing
was
available
this
would
do
its
an
easy
drink
despite
not
being
a
super
special
one
was
much
better
on
tap
d
this
bock
has
all
the
classic
flavors
but
it
is
somewhat
lacking
in
intensity
of
flavor
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
with
lots
of
complex
sugary
notes
that
are
exactly
what
i
would
expect
from
a
traditional
bock
the
flavor
has
all
of
the
same
flavors
but
they
seem
just
a
bit
dull
and
perhaps
not
as
dark
as
they
should
be
some
flavor
and
intensity
would
almost
have
to
be
sacrificed
considering
the
low
alcohol
content
but
all
things
considered
this
beer
works
quite
well
d
see
above
pours
an
amberbrown
body
with
an
initially
light
head
dwindling
to
faint
lacing
smells
of
slightly
metallic
husk
but
not
too
strongly
tastes
of
toasted
grain
tiny
pinch
of
hops
with
a
relatively
sweet
and
dry
finish
cannot
pick
up
any
strong
traces
in
particular
in
this
bock
style
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
of
beefing
up
in
terms
of
flavor
however
this
is
a
light
refreshing
beer
nonetheless
on
a
business
trip
to
memphis
i
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
popular
beer
it
poured
a
deep
golden
color
with
manifest
carbonation
over
a
finger
of
white
head
and
average
retention
the
nose
was
somewhat
unspectacular
malty
with
only
slight
notes
of
apple
and
caramel
the
taste
was
a
little
more
pronounced
with
malty
fruit
notes
and
a
sweet
finish
very
thin
and
highly
carbonated
the
feel
made
it
easy
enough
to
session
though
i
would
have
appreciated
a
little
more
intensity
in
the
flavor
profile
d
for
a
beer
at
is
a
little
light
and
water
it
is
not
too
hard
to
put
down
i
got
this
in
a
beer
a
beer
exchange
and
did
enjoy
it
but
i
would
not
buy
it
for
myself
d
easy
enough
to
drink
just
bland
and
boring
drinkability
this
brew
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
havent
had
it
for
a
couple
of
years
mostly
average
to
slightly
below
average
in
my
opinion
it
is
fairly
drinkable
i
dont
know
i
just
dont
have
much
to
say
about
it
kind
of
blah
drinkability
unassuming
look
here
if
you
want
a
bit
more
complexity
than
mass
marketed
brews
pours
a
clear
brown
with
almost
soda
like
offwhite
head
no
lacing
at
all
lots
of
carbonation
visible
in
the
pint
glass
smells
metallic
hints
of
bread
in
the
middle
there
are
also
faint
malts
in
the
background
taste
is
somewhat
bitter
this
beer
reminds
me
of
green
olives
im
also
getting
a
little
sweetness
from
the
malts
although
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
would
like
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highly
carbonated
very
crisp
although
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
its
ok
there
flavors
are
not
horrible
offensive
and
it
has
a
low
abv
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
other
mass
produced
beers
not
my
favorite
texas
beer
but
readily
available
and
has
good
drinkability
more
than
most
other
nonlight
beers
anyway
even
using
a
koozie
it
can
get
warm
quickly
which
is
a
bit
of
a
drag
when
you
live
in
a
hot
climate
id
recommend
trying
it
though
overall
this
wasnt
a
favorite
bock
of
mine
mouthfeel
is
way
off
i
like
german
bocks
much
better
not
really
for
me
a
bit
too
simple
pours
an
amberish
copper
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
goes
away
very
quickly
and
leaves
only
a
little
tiny
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
some
roasted
malt
and
not
much
else
tastes
much
the
same
like
a
little
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
to
round
it
out
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
and
drinkability
is
okay
not
a
very
strong
rendition
of
style
here
too
much
lack
of
flavor
if
you
drink
for
flavor
aroma
and
overall
experience
move
on
elsewhere
if
you
are
just
looking
for
something
cheap
that
most
bmc
drinkers
will
not
object
at
this
one
is
not
a
bad
choice
drinkable
if
not
a
little
bland
there
are
certainly
better
bocks
out
there
but
if
one
wants
a
very
quaffable
inoffensive
session
brew
this
will
work
the
taste
is
a
bit
oxidized
with
a
bit
of
cardboard
some
toast
in
there
with
caramel
plus
a
light
earth
feel
it
tastes
like
i
imagine
wet
leaves
would
wow
the
nose
was
decent
enough
but
this
taste
is
really
not
very
good
at
all
theres
an
offbitterness
in
the
feel
as
well
thin
and
gross
the
appearance
and
nose
werent
too
shabby
but
it
just
goes
way
way
downhill
after
that
there
are
many
many
more
beers
that
id
choose
over
this
one
bock
really
i
would
not
consider
this
a
bock
but
perhaps
a
dark
lager
the
appearance
is
too
clear
and
light
to
be
a
bock
and
there
is
no
head
retention
the
smell
is
weak
and
tends
toward
malty
toast
and
molasses
its
doesnt
taste
sweet
enough
to
be
a
bock
despite
the
malty
bread
notes
and
it
is
certainly
too
watery
to
be
a
bock
the
upside
is
that
it
is
certainly
easy
to
drink
this
is
more
reminiscent
of
negro
modelo
than
of
any
bock
ive
ever
had
dont
let
the
goat
on
the
label
fool
you
this
is
about
as
far
away
from
a
german
bock
as
you
can
get
overall
its
yate
side
note
when
i
was
growing
up
i
had
a
shiner
bock
tshirt
that
said
brewed
with
an
attitude
it
was
pretty
sweet
i
wish
i
still
had
it
overall
i
was
surprised
with
how
thin
and
flat
the
flavors
seemed
compared
to
my
memory
of
sitting
in
the
outdoor
patio
of
a
bar
in
columbia
sc
mingling
with
friends
the
night
before
a
buddys
wedding
and
clearing
out
the
bars
stock
of
shiner
bock
it
is
certainly
better
than
a
common
adjunct
lager
but
it
just
doesnt
measure
up
against
other
options
in
the
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
i
expect
something
a
little
more
bolder
and
less
watered
down
from
a
bock
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
drinkablity
goes
down
pretty
well
and
in
texas
its
usually
1
a
draft
cant
beat
it
beautiful
dark
amber
with
a
small
white
head
too
bad
the
head
was
extremely
shortlived
smells
is
nutty
and
toasty
the
taste
is
very
light
there
are
hints
of
hazelnut
and
toasted
malt
as
well
as
a
hop
tang
unfortunately
i
also
taste
some
graininess
which
isnt
necessarily
bad
but
its
definitely
a
taste
i
associate
with
cheap
highly
quaffable
and
refreshing
but
i
certainly
wasnt
blown
away
very
drinkable
beer
these
go
down
easy
ive
had
tastier
bocks
before
but
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
and
not
hard
to
down
at
all
notes
i
drank
more
than
a
few
of
these
the
last
time
i
was
down
in
texas
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
in
the
summer
heat
and
it
pairs
very
well
with
texas
bbq
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
about
one
finger
of
head
and
0
lacing
while
the
look
of
the
beer
was
what
i
expected
the
initial
smell
was
fairly
absent
overall
not
impressed
by
the
taste
seems
watered
down
and
fairly
boring
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
i
usually
enjoy
but
it
just
does
not
fair
well
with
the
taste
of
this
beer
might
go
good
with
a
spicy
meal
but
otherwise
you
wont
find
me
buying
this
anytime
soon
maybe
i
need
to
try
it
on
tap
as
i
can
say
i
always
enjoy
beer
more
that
way
there
are
much
better
choices
out
there
this
pours
a
nice
amber
red
the
white
foam
that
has
long
been
discarded
the
smell
is
fairly
vacant
what
does
come
through
is
the
corn
syrupy
ricelike
aroma
of
an
aal
not
a
bock
the
hops
are
soured
if
that
is
what
im
smelling
the
taste
is
a
caramel
malt
that
fades
away
to
taste
like
steel
the
skunky
steel
taste
tastes
just
like
the
movie
starring
shaq
the
malts
are
slightly
burned
and
not
really
that
pleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
its
well
carbonated
for
its
medium
body
i
could
see
some
people
drinking
this
but
not
really
me
i
dont
like
this
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
any
of
my
friends
the
beer
pours
a
nice
brown
amber
body
that
cascades
into
gold
highlights
nice
creamy
lightbrown
head
slowly
recedes
the
smell
is
big
on
chocolate
notes
and
some
bitter
hops
that
are
more
dark
chocolate
than
coffee
airy
like
carbonation
not
much
else
the
taste
is
light
and
inoffensive
slightly
chocolatesweet
finish
i
like
the
mouthfeel
not
too
light
and
creamy
but
not
overloaded
with
carbonation
a
beer
i
could
probably
drink
all
day
if
i
had
more
still
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
brew
ive
had
it
before
in
bottle
and
i
remember
finding
it
awfully
plain
for
a
bock
to
me
its
just
like
a
heartier
golden
beer
a
little
in
the
hops
category
a
little
in
the
malts
soft
on
the
palate
not
bad
d
unexciting
i
have
had
many
better
bock
beers
this
tastes
like
an
assembly
line
macrobrewed
bock
the
beer
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
with
some
toffee
malt
and
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
toffee
and
crass
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
something
that
resembles
dark
fruit
but
it
is
subtle
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
texas
classic
but
nothing
too
impressive
it
certainly
doesnt
stack
up
to
the
some
of
the
other
craft
beers
from
texas
very
drinkable
love
the
color
nice
amber
to
it
great
malt
taste
you
can
really
learn
to
enjoy
this
beer
only
problem
to
me
is
there
really
isnt
alot
of
kick
in
it
but
taste
deffinetly
compensates
one
of
my
favorite
beers
a
texas
classic
beer
that
never
disapoints
if
you
havent
tried
it
you
really
got
to
get
your
hands
on
one
two
thumbs
up
not
the
first
time
having
this
beer
and
i
very
much
enjoy
drinking
it
mostly
because
its
completely
associated
in
my
mind
with
texas
yes
its
not
an
excellent
bock
but
it
feels
oldfashioned
trademark
of
a
certain
place
next
time
im
in
texas
ill
drink
it
again
im
à
bit
disapointed
i
expected
à
litle
bit
more
of
this
beer
overall
shiner
bock
seems
like
a
decent
gateway
beer
to
this
style
nothing
great
here
but
there
is
some
nice
flavor
and
a
great
appearance
matt
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
kind
of
malty
there
is
some
minimal
sweetness
and
there
is
a
clean
finish
to
the
beer
its
not
a
great
masterpiece
but
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
it
its
drinkable
it
has
a
flavor
and
there
is
no
nasty
aftertaste
there
are
far
worse
beers
that
deserve
to
be
on
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
list
golden
brown
auburn
highlights
an
enticing
blend
of
earth
tones
though
head
should
grow
more
than
14
inch
the
aroma
is
somewhat
lacking
no
negative
qualities
but
not
enough
positives
to
stand
out
among
the
kings
the
malty
flavor
begs
for
an
accompaniment
of
smoked
almonds
or
similar
cracked
nuts
it
sits
well
enough
to
satisfy
if
not
serve
as
a
beckon
call
for
another
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
loyal
beer
both
to
the
mind
which
filters
the
myriad
of
qualifiers
and
to
the
heart
which
loves
that
which
it
knows
not
a
legend
but
the
bell
cow
of
the
little
brewery
will
not
disappoint
overall
a
nicely
solid
bock
here
and
certainly
better
then
what
i
was
expecting
going
into
it
shiner
bock
pours
into
a
pint
glass
a
clear
deep
red
amber
color
under
a
thin
head
and
carries
a
mild
nose
of
light
sugar
malt
with
a
hint
of
candied
cherry
and
caramel
drunk
immediately
from
the
fridge
it
opens
up
with
an
overshadowing
carbonated
feel
and
continues
that
way
throughout
delivering
little
more
than
a
held
back
caramel
malt
sweet
undertone
initially
i
felt
this
restraint
was
due
to
too
high
of
a
carbonation
but
as
the
beer
slowly
warmed
up
toward
room
temperature
i
noticed
that
the
cold
carbonated
flood
mellowed
out
and
progressively
allowed
for
a
better
sense
of
a
mild
dark
malt
sweetness
and
light
caramel
backbone
eureka
all
in
all
this
is
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
brew
that
gets
the
job
done
when
it
comes
to
beating
the
heat
during
the
dog
days
of
summer
in
its
native
land
of
texasnothing
more
nothing
less
d
being
on
the
lighter
side
this
does
bump
up
the
drinkability
a
brew
i
would
not
seek
out
but
not
turn
away
this
is
a
refreshing
boch
thats
especially
good
in
warm
weather
drinkability
an
okay
lager
that
is
certainly
not
a
bock
md
the
body
feels
a
bit
light
for
the
style
and
the
carbonation
is
light
this
beer
is
not
very
drinkable
m
very
light
body
with
a
short
ending
that
lets
feel
a
little
bitterness
of
hops
pours
an
amber
colour
with
some
head
not
a
huge
smell
sweet
caramel
i
think
im
missing
the
hops
here
but
i
cant
really
notice
any
i
get
sweet
malt
there
are
no
off
flavours
though
either
so
i
dont
want
to
say
this
tastes
bad
it
just
is
lacking
carbonation
and
drinkability
are
fine
though
it
is
easy
to
see
how
some
who
have
higher
expectations
of
a
true
bock
would
object
to
this
stuff
but
i
reviewed
it
as
a
beer
in
general
since
im
no
authority
about
what
a
bock
should
be
like
d
considering
it
doesnt
taste
bad
drinkability
is
higher
nothing
to
taste
so
theres
nothing
to
disgust
you
about
this
beer
in
reality
i
could
drink
this
as
a
thirst
quencher
light
in
body
making
it
easy
to
drink
amber
to
brown
in
color
the
small
head
falls
into
the
beer
with
record
speed
faint
initial
smell
reminds
me
of
cooked
celery
and
cabbage
taste
is
very
mild
but
nonoffensive
slight
bready
malt
and
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
fluid
without
much
presence
on
the
tongue
and
seems
flat
for
such
a
mild
beer
i
found
it
rather
toilsome
to
drink
probably
best
to
just
slug
these
out
of
the
bottle
overall
not
impressed
more
of
a
lager
than
a
bock
light
alcohol
presence
and
moderate
body
would
make
you
well
able
to
have
plenty
of
these
if
you
wanted
to
better
than
a
bmc
lager
but
not
what
i
wanted
at
most
gatherings
this
beer
is
a
usual
suspect
they
sell
it
in
cans
which
is
nice
going
to
a
river
or
lake
since
glass
is
not
allowed
at
most
places
pairs
well
with
heavy
meals
like
barbeque
texmex
and
in
my
opinion
everything
d
quaffable
but
nothing
really
interesting
better
than
the
bmcs
of
the
world
but
not
by
much
d
after
taking
a
look
and
a
whiff
i
thought
this
beer
may
be
underrated
unfortunately
upon
first
sip
this
beer
begins
to
fall
apart
seems
to
stray
greatly
from
style
guidelines
and
doesnt
do
so
in
a
groundbreaking
or
memorable
way
a
struggle
to
finish
one
and
something
i
would
likely
avoid
in
the
future
just
a
tad
better
then
the
traditional
bmc
offerings
pours
a
nice
mahogany
color
clean
and
clear
with
a
little
bit
of
foam
on
top
aromas
of
caramel
toasted
malt
and
maybe
some
molasses
easy
drinking
nicely
carbonated
with
some
caramel
flavor
a
little
malt
and
maybe
way
back
some
hops
nothing
all
that
exciting
but
drinkable
and
fairly
enjoyable
drinkability
is
relatively
high
although
the
flavor
profile
lacks
dimension
its
not
all
bad
and
with
low
abv
it
is
quite
sessionable
i
would
have
no
problems
leaving
this
in
the
can
and
having
an
all
day
barbeque
overall
not
really
what
i
can
call
a
craft
beer
d
it
isnt
difficult
to
drink
this
beer
but
the
flavors
taste
a
lot
better
while
it
is
still
cold
pretty
drinkable
can
put
down
a
sixer
with
no
problems
notes
i
didnt
find
anything
too
spectacular
about
this
beer
it
was
just
okay
and
didnt
seem
to
bring
anything
unique
to
the
table
overall
it
was
an
average
bock
and
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
one
again
5
goes
down
easy
very
sessionable
beer
thin
bodied
with
a
slightly
dry
earthy
hop
presence
that
lingers
throughout
over
a
slightly
toasty
caramel
malt
backbone
hints
of
toffee
caramel
and
a
slight
nuttiness
but
all
of
these
characterisitcs
are
faint
its
a
bit
drier
than
i
prefer
and
not
very
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
poured
quickly
into
a
pint
glass
and
got
about
2
fingers
of
head
which
disappeared
quickly
color
was
a
light
golden
brown
smells
a
little
malty
with
a
some
nuts
taste
is
malty
slightly
nutty
with
a
bitter
finish
not
much
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
with
not
much
carbonation
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
as
there
isnt
much
to
it
but
id
still
take
this
over
a
michelob
amber
bock
a
bit
pricey
for
the
quality
but
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
very
flavorful
bock
if
you
are
looking
for
something
a
little
different
from
the
big
3
give
it
a
try
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
real
bock
look
elsewhere
d
this
can
do
in
a
pinch
i
dont
think
this
one
is
brewed
with
beer
advocates
in
mind
for
being
the
most
well
known
bock
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
definition
very
well
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
a
light
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
of
toasted
grain
and
a
bit
sweet
the
taste
begins
sort
of
sweet
but
finishes
clean
it
has
a
light
feel
with
not
much
body
but
goes
down
smooth
easy
good
beer
to
drink
for
most
any
occasion
the
alcohol
content
makes
it
a
good
session
beer
drinkability
tasty
not
overly
complex
but
certainly
sessionableespecially
on
a
warmer
day
could
easily
put
back
a
six
bought
in
mt
vernon
washington
for
1
99
a
bomber
worth
the
the
money
for
what
it
is
a
easy
drinking
lager
that
has
more
caramel
notes
than
a
bmc
lager
drank
it
ice
cold
and
enjoyed
the
basic
plain
drinkability
of
this
beer
food
friendly
and
a
decent
finish
this
beer
is
not
some
craft
take
on
a
bock
but
rather
a
regional
beer
that
sits
slightly
above
the
bmc
beers
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
caramel
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
touch
of
nuts
taste
is
malty
bready
some
caramel
notes
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
decent
beer
the
taste
is
smooth
however
watery
some
wet
malt
flavor
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
im
sure
it
would
be
perfect
for
a
baseball
game
in
really
hot
weather
and
so
would
many
other
things
d
drinks
fine
a
half
step
up
from
bmc
but
just
a
half
definitely
had
better
kind
of
bleh
in
the
mouth
oilslick
and
rather
stale
very
drinkable
and
very
repeatable
during
a
session
of
cards
or
talking
still
a
very
drinkable
everyday
brew
just
not
balanced
beats
the
hell
out
of
the
macros
for
sure
but
my
old
go
to
brews
like
yuengling
beat
it
up
good
d
ok
i
guess
a
notch
above
a
typical
macro
d
you
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
but
with
the
low
alcohol
and
very
mild
taste
i
do
not
think
that
you
would
really
want
to
wont
drink
it
again
wish
i
hadnt
drank
it
kind
of
a
beer
sorry
refreshing
brew
with
no
bad
flavors
i
could
drink
several
of
these
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
nothing
special
in
the
least
pours
a
very
clear
brown
with
a
miniscule
white
bubbly
head
that
leaves
no
real
amount
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
caramel
with
a
hint
of
molasses
the
taste
generally
follows
though
the
caramel
is
weaker
and
the
molasses
has
a
good
amount
of
water
thrown
in
making
for
a
pretty
bland
bocklike
taste
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
low
bit
of
carbonation
though
a
slight
fizzy
feel
on
the
tongue
and
a
watery
feel
making
a
decently
drinkable
brew
but
the
desire
to
do
so
really
doesnt
come
through
very
much
average
at
best
d
taste
of
a
darker
beer
but
lightness
allows
for
excellent
drinkability
this
has
a
rich
amber
color
and
a
bold
taste
it
can
be
poured
very
aggressively
i
was
lucky
enough
to
go
to
the
home
of
spoetzl
brewery
san
antonio
with
the
spartan
marching
band
for
the
alamo
bowl
this
last
year
and
i
got
to
have
some
there
its
always
better
in
the
city
it
was
brewed
in
low
abv
for
style
and
inoffensive
but
a
rather
thin
fizzy
brew
at
4
4
you
may
as
well
just
be
drinking
coors
light
because
thats
cheaper
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
if
faced
with
a
choice
between
shiner
or
a
bmc
id
take
the
shiner
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
chase
down
shiner
bock
but
i
will
drink
one
from
time
to
time
if
only
in
the
name
of
nostalgia
while
it
wont
blow
your
socks
off
shiner
bock
does
get
respect
for
being
a
viable
option
all
those
years
before
the
craft
movement
took
hold
of
the
american
brew
scene
i
will
leave
it
at
that
this
is
the
usual
ontap
dark
beer
at
restaurants
and
bars
around
here
so
im
sure
ill
end
up
having
this
again
rjt
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
tho
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
and
tastes
of
all
malt
with
no
noticeable
hops
bearable
but
very
forgettable
has
a
ton
of
carbonation
like
a
macro
buthas
a
heavier
mouthfeel
a
bit
syrupy
that
would
be
really
nice
if
it
was
paried
with
a
good
flavor
but
its
just
not
there
d
doesnt
go
down
that
easily
and
leaves
an
odd
aftertaste
i
would
op
for
others
of
this
style
in
the
future
overall
this
beer
is
in
about
the
same
price
range
as
the
big
three
which
makes
it
a
good
value
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
or
even
drink
often
but
if
you
are
in
a
pinch
its
a
nice
fall
back
will
probably
get
this
again
some
other
time
d
i
love
this
beer
as
an
american
macro
classic
the
labeling
is
so
oldschool
and
classic
and
i
know
that
for
a
lot
of
peple
in
the
southwest
were
it
not
for
this
beer
and
michelob
amber
they
would
not
even
know
that
there
were
styles
other
than
pilseners
as
a
bock
it
is
only
soso
but
as
a
mainstream
american
beergateway
beer
for
the
unenlightened
i
give
it
a
super
high
rating
d
very
drinkable
at
a
price
of
a
simple
beer
that
is
very
macrolike
easy
to
drink
not
much
going
on
a
step
above
macro
lager
mouthfeel
is
consistent
throughout
doesnt
fade
or
change
kinda
drinkable
although
the
cost
increase
lately
is
getting
prohibitive
good
for
a
hot
day
to
refresh
yourself
dont
let
the
bock
fool
you
though
there
is
nothing
strong
about
this
beer
barely
stronger
than
a
lager
just
more
flavor
i
definately
think
freshness
makes
a
difference
here
i
have
had
at
a
restraunt
like
love
and
war
in
texas
where
you
know
they
empty
at
least
keg
of
shiner
every
day
and
the
drinkablity
is
killer
then
go
to
applebees
or
something
and
the
taste
is
different
poured
a
deep
clear
amber
with
good
carbonation
and
small
dirty
white
head
nose
is
dry
weak
grains
and
thats
about
it
taste
is
grain
hardly
any
booze
some
citrus
and
maybe
caramel
body
and
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
not
a
bock
i
would
go
to
again
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
dark
amber
color
with
no
head
carmel
sugar
grain
corn
astringent
tastes
a
small
amount
of
caramel
and
sugar
tastes
some
maple
syrup
slick
mouth
feel
like
syrup
on
pancakes
but
not
quite
as
sweet
drinkable
nature
is
okay
d
fairly
easy
todrink
would
be
more
so
without
the
sweetness
overall
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
if
i
want
a
sessionable
bock
ill
go
with
sa
winter
lager
drinkabilty
it
pairs
well
with
a
variety
of
situations
and
food
its
been
my
go
to
for
many
occasions
when
i
need
to
bring
a
six
pack
to
share
drinkability
with
the
odd
sweetsour
flavors
and
low
abv
this
isnt
really
what
i
would
consider
a
true
bock
style
beer
at
all
i
know
bocks
and
like
bocks
and
you
shiner
are
no
bock
beer
more
like
a
weak
and
watery
american
amber
or
nut
brown
than
a
bock
not
going
to
seek
this
one
out
again
bottle
into
a
dimpled
mug
poured
a
dark
amber
with
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
very
quickly
the
nose
was
of
a
nutty
caramelmolasses
sweetness
with
a
tiny
hint
of
the
yeast
nothing
too
obtrusive
however
lively
carbonation
in
the
mouth
and
the
drink
itself
was
very
smooth
the
slight
sweetness
of
the
malts
came
forward
as
expected
but
surprisingly
there
was
very
little
bite
at
the
end
which
i
have
encountered
in
other
examples
of
this
style
a
nice
average
offering
and
very
drinkable
i
would
think
a
nice
hoagie
would
work
nice
here
i
love
shiner
bock
its
great
on
draft
or
straight
from
the
bottle
it
has
a
very
dark
color
which
is
surprising
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
dark
beer
at
all
it
isnt
very
heavy
and
doesnt
have
a
very
strong
taste
an
ice
cold
mug
of
shiner
bock
can
be
very
refreshing
overall
an
ok
macroish
bock
really
more
like
an
all
malt
lager
with
some
food
coloring
but
certainly
a
step
up
from
drinking
macro
junk
good
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
what
it
lacks
in
mouth
feel
it
makes
up
in
taste
far
from
complex
but
far
from
swill
mouth
is
watery
but
bold
this
is
a
beer
that
i
can
and
will
drink
all
day
after
trying
so
many
new
and
interesting
beers
the
novelty
from
shiner
has
worn
off
still
a
good
beer
and
i
will
continue
to
drink
it
but
i
know
ill
keep
trying
others
buy
again
maybe
with
others
but
not
for
myself
had
it
on
tap
and
it
was
substantially
worse
do
avoid
that
i
have
had
shiner
bock
in
a
glass
on
tap
and
a
can
it
is
all
great
d
too
watery
to
be
bock
style
the
good
thing
was
that
i
taked
me
away
the
horrible
taste
of
the
spinachs
i
was
eating
acceptable
beer
i
have
tasted
worst
beers
from
texas
notes
decent
bock
but
not
enough
alcohol
and
the
adjunct
flavor
is
disappointing
still
a
decent
beer
to
go
for
if
you
want
a
dark
flavorful
lager
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
has
been
available
in
my
area
for
years
so
it
was
my
go
to
at
bars
when
they
didnt
have
anything
else
notes
this
beer
holds
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
having
played
in
bar
bands
for
several
years
where
i
live
its
very
hard
to
find
a
beer
that
isnt
one
of
the
typical
american
light
beers
as
a
young
man
this
is
the
beer
that
would
sit
well
in
my
gut
and
not
make
me
feel
like
i
was
full
of
lightwatery
stale
foam
darker
richer
and
far
more
flavor
than
the
average
bar
beer
around
here
thank
you
for
countless
nights
of
beer
induced
loud
live
music
shiner
bock
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
nothing
i
would
seek
out
but
dont
mind
putting
a
couple
away
d
not
a
bad
swill
could
sit
down
for
a
session
of
these
very
nice
brew
nice
color
no
nasty
aftertaste
when
you
consider
the
price
of
this
texas
brew
with
a
comp
from
europe
its
a
great
value
for
bock
drinkers
impossible
to
find
in
the
western
ny
area
im
from
so
i
bring
it
back
from
beer
stores
in
erie
pa
ive
never
had
a
complainy
when
i
serve
this
bock
conclusion
its
better
than
michelob
amber
bock
which
is
the
only
other
bock
i
see
noncraft
people
imbibing
regularly
maybe
thats
a
bit
harsh
to
compare
those
two
beers
because
this
is
significantly
better
than
the
ab
this
is
drinkable
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
your
macrobuddies
to
craft
beer
but
other
than
that
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
it
up
overall
not
up
to
the
hype
obviously
nothing
like
an
actual
bock
but
more
like
an
american
dark
lager
not
bad
especially
when
compared
to
the
major
light
lagers
but
certainly
not
spectacular
i
had
this
in
oklahoma
at
the
airport
the
dudes
at
the
bar
raved
about
it
so
i
picked
up
a
mixed
sixer
and
sat
down
to
review
the
golden
appearance
and
medium
quickly
dissipating
head
was
not
so
bad
for
a
semimainstream
brew
i
love
the
sweet
malt
taste
of
this
for
some
reason
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
shinerbock
was
easily
drinkable
nice
overall
a
non
offensive
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
if
thats
my
only
option
i
hope
my
friends
in
texas
have
found
a
new
drink
for
my
next
visit
not
a
bad
beer
i
think
this
beer
is
definitely
underrated
the
head
isnt
anything
special
however
it
does
have
a
nice
color
this
beer
is
great
for
sessions
in
some
places
you
can
find
it
in
cans
it
tastes
good
and
its
easy
to
drink
i
consider
it
one
of
my
favorites
the
taste
is
light
nothing
special
it
has
a
pretty
heavy
mouthfeel
but
there
is
a
weird
after
taste
that
makes
it
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
d
i
had
to
knock
the
drinkability
down
half
a
point
for
the
sweetness
this
beer
has
that
would
be
the
only
thing
stopping
me
from
drinking
a
lot
of
this
a
lower
abv
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
but
the
sweetness
limits
its
session
like
qualties
for
me
at
least
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
dont
think
its
a
true
bock
and
it
certainly
doesnt
taste
like
one
that
said
its
still
a
great
beer
and
one
im
sure
ill
turn
to
again
d
a
very
drinkable
session
style
beer
lower
on
the
abv
by
about
2
points
than
is
normal
for
a
bock
style
beer
my
girlfriend
loves
this
one
so
we
often
have
part
of
a
sixer
in
the
house
i
definitely
see
this
beer
as
a
macro
style
beer
and
doesnt
really
fit
into
the
bock
style
but
still
a
decent
offering
and
pays
homage
to
the
tradition
of
an
old
school
texas
brewery
drink
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
not
bad
at
all
not
great
but
i
wouldnt
pass
one
up
nothing
id
buy
again
if
they
called
this
shiner
amber
lager
id
score
it
better
this
isnt
bad
beer
but
calling
it
a
bock
is
definately
misleading
its
attractive
light
brown
and
drinkable
but
apparently
the
malt
flavor
backbone
of
a
bock
had
one
too
many
at
the
bar
and
forgot
to
get
on
the
bus
this
is
just
too
flavorless
for
a
bock
d
excellent
session
beer
not
to
heavy
on
flavor
or
body
but
enough
to
put
em
down
like
a
champ
overall
very
average
andd
the
fact
that
this
runs
30
more
than
the
average
economy
brew
means
that
is
unlikely
ill
be
buying
this
this
poured
a
clear
mahogany
with
some
tan
head
it
smelled
like
sour
yeast
and
burnt
barley
with
some
lemon
and
copper
hops
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
bread
crust
it
tasted
like
roasted
barley
and
copper
hops
with
some
lemon
and
crust
and
sour
yeast
it
was
thin
and
very
carbonated
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
fairly
clean
with
a
moderately
enjoyable
taste
but
was
generally
not
an
appetizing
beer
the
body
was
poor
although
it
was
bland
enough
to
still
be
reasonably
easy
to
drink
better
than
some
macros
but
not
as
good
as
most
craft
beers
not
recommended
drinkability
good
refreshing
pleasant
to
drink
but
not
particularly
interesting
d
average
its
light
but
the
beer
is
slightly
subpar
overall
its
drinkable
enough
low
abv
and
mild
taste
but
youll
get
bored
of
it
quickly
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
in
my
book
but
the
relatively
light
and
monotonous
flavor
hold
it
back
a
little
d
besides
the
muted
nose
and
watered
downess
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
its
not
too
heavy
and
the
caramel
flavors
are
nice
now
it
wouldnt
be
my
gotobeer
but
i
could
have
two
or
three
of
these
i
put
3
of
these
away
the
other
night
in
the
course
of
cooking
a
meal
they
dont
exactly
stick
with
you
not
memorable
but
easy
and
enjoyable
enough
to
drink
reddish
brown
a
little
bit
of
head
which
dissipated
quickly
no
lacing
was
not
much
there
in
the
smell
department
couldnt
pick
up
anything
noticeable
just
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
in
the
taste
no
hops
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
off
tasting
low
carbonation
a
little
fizzy
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
however
with
not
much
taste
i
probably
would
not
drink
too
many
i
am
glad
i
did
not
have
to
buy
it
id
seen
signs
and
bottles
and
packs
of
this
all
around
since
moving
to
arkansas
i
am
very
disappointed
the
beer
just
doesnt
have
any
redeeming
qualities
and
seems
to
be
a
lacking
slightly
sweet
commercial
lager
i
miss
having
this
on
tap
back
in
the
early
90s
in
austin
we
used
to
go
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
get
it
then
to
the
black
cat
for
pbr
in
a
can
and
catch
a
show
at
emos
sadly
this
is
not
the
beer
i
remember
it
being
back
then
it
is
thin
and
flavorless
a
disappointment
i
have
been
putting
this
review
off
for
years
hoping
that
spoetzl
would
return
to
the
shiner
of
yore
but
alas
clear
bodied
amber
beer
looks
like
a
lighter
version
than
most
plenty
of
white
fizzy
head
looks
to
be
well
carbonated
aromas
are
slight
bit
of
malt
and
not
much
else
the
whole
metallic
thing
is
present
along
with
a
slight
amount
of
caramel
malt
in
there
flavor
fades
to
not
much
of
anything
light
bodied
and
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
mouthfeel
department
either
d
very
drinkable
not
much
on
the
flavors
or
heaviness
so
drinking
a
few
of
these
would
be
no
problem
d
i
try
to
support
texas
breweries
and
spoetzl
but
the
bock
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
their
main
offerings
this
beer
deserves
the
rating
it
gets
it
is
nothing
special
and
honestly
an
awful
representation
of
the
style
ontap
at
penguin
eds
in
fayetteville
ar
man
i
was
expecting
something
resembling
a
bock
but
the
closest
this
gets
is
maybe
michelob
amber
bock
theres
a
distinct
corny
adjunct
tang
in
the
background
with
only
light
caramel
roll
malts
it
wasnt
bad
for
washing
down
my
pulled
pork
and
potato
salad
but
i
wont
waste
my
time
or
liver
on
this
brew
again
not
terribly
offensive
i
guess
but
not
worth
trying
either
overall
drinkable
beer
not
great
not
bad
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
they
have
this
beer
virtually
everywhere
here
in
houston
so
if
nothing
else
its
better
than
the
typical
domestic
swill
bud
bud
lt
you
could
easily
session
this
beer
unfortunately
ill
be
constantly
searching
for
something
with
more
flavor
d
pretty
disappointing
experience
i
had
a
feeling
it
was
going
to
be
bad
when
i
saw
no
head
it
wasnt
just
the
bar
either
as
i
got
a
sweetwater
with
a
perfect
head
a
pretty
poor
testemant
to
shiner
my
second
bad
brew
from
them
after
their
hefeweizen
try
at
your
own
risk
drinkability
its
not
bad
but
its
not
something
im
jacked
about
getting
again
from
a
bottle
pours
a
fairly
dark
amber
colour
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissapated
to
a
thin
ring
fairly
quickly
smells
slightly
sweet
mostly
of
caramel
and
malt
taste
is
on
the
light
side
almost
watered
down
but
crisp
and
refreshing
this
beer
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
drinkability
this
beer
in
my
opinion
goes
well
with
a
meal
or
a
snack
and
maybe
by
itself
on
a
hot
day
although
i
think
shiner
kolsch
now
discontinued
was
king
in
that
category
but
i
think
alone
it
cant
stand
its
very
weak
for
a
bock
but
its
still
a
good
beer
i
like
shiners
lineup
and
the
first
time
i
had
this
long
ago
it
was
quickly
one
of
my
favorites
now
with
time
either
my
taste
buds
have
changed
and
im
moving
onto
new
flavors
or
the
brew
has
changed
a
tad
im
thinking
the
former
still
well
worth
having
from
time
to
time
with
a
good
meal
where
you
dont
want
the
beer
drowning
out
the
flavors
of
the
food
pours
a
dark
amber
crystal
clear
a
little
bit
of
a
coarse
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
short
while
nothing
overly
impressive
in
the
aroma
or
taste
a
little
sweet
a
slight
cornflavor
a
little
toasty
with
some
floral
hops
thin
body
but
overall
pretty
refreshing
and
very
easy
drinking
on
a
day
that
topped
out
well
over
100
degrees
beachshore
yes
but
not
my
first
choice
i
was
underwhelmed
by
the
total
sum
of
this
beer
i
imagine
if
i
wanted
to
drink
dark
beer
on
a
sweltering
day
this
would
be
the
compromise
if
you
like
a
good
bock
stay
away
from
this
one
pours
an
amber
like
color
with
a
slightly
off
color
head
the
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
hops
at
the
back
end
but
the
smell
is
faint
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
some
slightly
bitter
earthy
hops
on
the
back
end
very
smooth
taste
but
not
very
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
slightly
dry
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
spectacular
you
could
drink
a
good
amount
but
it
would
get
old
after
a
while
drinkability
very
drinkable
had
many
times
before
with
few
problems
its
not
the
best
but
its
shiner
itll
do
would
like
to
try
on
tap
closer
to
its
home
in
texas
the
key
now
is
to
try
one
again
now
that
im
home
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
the
first
time
around
serving
type
bottle
poured
a
deep
copper
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
faded
quickly
aroma
of
caramel
metallic
copper
and
toffee
medium
bodied
with
a
biscuity
light
malt
flavor
and
sweet
aftertaste
that
finished
clean
good
drinkability
this
is
nothing
to
seek
out
but
a
great
alternative
if
you
find
it
at
a
bar
stocked
with
macros
taste
little
bit
of
caramel
little
bit
of
floral
hops
fairly
clean
and
refreshing
kind
of
a
dry
finish
to
it
you
wont
find
complex
flavorings
from
exotic
malts
and
yeasts
with
this
beer
dont
expect
them
lightish
body
enough
carbonation
present
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
may
try
again
drinkability
while
nothing
is
really
making
this
beer
stand
out
its
not
as
if
its
a
terrible
tasting
drink
and
the
body
isnt
heavy
so
i
do
feel
that
i
could
drink
sevefal
of
these
if
necessary
or
if
it
was
all
that
was
being
offered
much
better
appearance
than
i
expected
but
it
is
a
bock
nice
amber
hue
smell
of
melt
sugar
bit
of
hops
spices
pretty
standard
malty
bock
with
a
slight
hoppiness
nice
example
for
being
more
mainstream
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
and
feels
good
in
the
mouth
could
be
a
decent
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
metallic
taste
overall
an
easy
drinker
but
not
bad
d
very
easy
to
drink
since
its
kind
of
a
watered
down
bock
notes
good
ol
shiner
bock
was
my
introduction
to
the
beer
world
and
for
that
i
owe
it
some
props
tastes
just
like
i
remember
it
too
its
not
nearly
strong
enough
to
really
be
a
bock
more
like
an
amber
lager
its
mainly
for
people
who
arent
beer
geeks
but
who
want
something
better
than
bmc
for
a
cheap
price
d
sweet
and
watery
sums
it
up
drinkable
in
large
quantities
yes
would
i
want
to
probably
not
so
i
drank
one
of
these
where
there
wasnt
much
choice
medium
yellow
moderate
head
smells
of
corn
and
macro
tastes
of
sweet
corn
macro
basically
like
bud
as
it
warms
up
it
gets
somewhat
worse
carbonation
was
fine
just
not
much
flavor
light
enough
to
drink
but
id
prefer
something
more
complex
closest
thing
i
have
had
to
an
adjunct
bock
nothing
spectacular
but
would
accept
if
offered
poured
a
pretty
coppery
color
with
a
fairly
large
head
that
disippated
quickly
not
much
lacing
really
pretty
color
though
there
was
virtually
no
scent
at
all
what
there
was
was
grain
and
malt
the
taste
was
about
like
the
smell
grain
and
malt
and
fairly
weak
a
rather
watery
mouthfeel
not
much
complexity
drinkable
though
its
a
nice
one
if
youre
really
thirsty
and
just
want
something
to
quench
your
thirst
honestly
its
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
it
certainly
beats
the
macros
also
you
really
cant
beat
the
price
for
something
thats
better
than
the
macros
yet
easy
on
the
budget
and
a
low
alcohol
besides
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
5
99
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
honey
brown
color
with
a
slight
red
tinge
the
head
is
almost
nonexistent
barring
a
thin
rim
of
carbonation
and
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
the
smell
is
not
overwhelming
but
is
of
sweet
grainy
malt
slightly
buttery
and
bready
the
flavor
is
similar
rather
one
dimensional
sweetness
that
doesnt
really
ever
go
anywhere
the
mouthfeel
is
definitely
on
the
light
side
for
a
bock
beer
the
carbonation
is
thin
and
burns
the
mouth
drinkability
of
this
is
decent
goes
down
like
water
and
for
the
price
is
better
than
most
bmc
beers
the
low
abv
for
the
style
also
makes
it
more
drinkable
but
less
desirable
in
my
opinion
pours
a
clear
brown
with
practically
no
head
just
a
thin
line
of
bubbles
on
top
of
the
beer
smells
like
honey
roasted
malts
with
a
little
bit
of
earthy
hop
a
sweet
toasted
malt
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
earthy
hop
pretty
good
however
there
is
a
slight
tang
to
it
mouthfeel
is
ok
carbonation
adds
a
little
spice
to
the
beer
drinkability
is
ok
d
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
its
drinkability
since
it
isnt
a
typical
bock
its
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
its
really
just
a
watered
down
bock
with
adjuncts
this
particular
review
was
conducted
with
a
shiner
bock
that
was
brewed
during
the
100th
anniversery
of
the
spoetzl
brewery
for
the
most
part
its
quite
good
however
it
seems
fairly
light
for
a
dark
lager
in
terms
of
both
color
and
mouthfeel
its
definately
on
the
sweeter
side
as
would
be
expected
for
the
style
but
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
the
overall
presentation
from
my
previous
experiences
it
is
definately
far
better
ontap
try
a
few
of
these
if
youre
out
for
a
night
on
the
town
drinkability
was
high
as
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
albeit
a
little
weak
it
did
not
fade
like
a
lot
of
weaker
lagers
overall
an
okay
beer
not
one
i
would
repeat
unless
i
had
too
but
it
is
alroght
in
florida
it
is
a
lot
higher
than
a
lot
of
states
pours
a
dark
redbrown
with
practically
no
foam
at
all
it
looks
flat
although
its
not
not
much
smell
to
speak
of
flavors
great
though
lots
and
lots
of
malt
a
little
bit
of
hop
kick
not
much
carbonation
but
a
flavor
that
sticks
with
you
for
a
while
this
one
threads
the
needle
for
me
between
a
light
american
lager
and
a
darker
more
intense
brew
its
not
spectacular
but
i
feel
like
it
would
be
hard
to
find
an
occasion
or
food
pairing
for
which
this
would
be
a
bad
beer
im
just
glad
this
was
a
left
over
from
a
party
and
i
never
paid
for
this
so
called
bock
i
suggest
sending
this
back
to
texas
d
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
one
i
had
to
choke
down
either
its
good
in
a
pinch
though
d
i
can
say
one
thing
i
drank
this
beer
fast
it
goes
down
quite
easy
the
problem
you
forget
you
actually
drank
it
d
this
was
really
an
average
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
other
than
the
lack
of
flavor
a
good
choice
for
a
light
beer
drinker
who
wants
to
have
a
pretend
dark
beer
if
i
was
in
the
same
situation
i
was
before
and
everything
else
was
a
light
mass
produced
lager
i
would
pick
this
again
otherwise
i
will
go
with
something
else
had
in
a
bottle
with
barbeque
mild
toasty
malt
flavor
quickly
washed
away
with
some
hops
dry
finish
nothing
really
stands
out
but
nothing
offends
either
really
good
for
having
with
barbeque
or
to
drink
multiple
pitchers
of
bars
in
texas
tend
to
sell
this
pretty
cheap
so
thats
always
good
d
this
is
the
beer
that
i
get
when
im
at
a
non
beer
bar
its
better
tasting
than
your
macros
but
not
as
good
as
the
local
craft
beers
its
the
beer
to
drink
when
you
dont
want
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
is
worse
than
the
score
the
sum
of
the
components
ought
to
be
subtraction
ill
say
it
again
bud
dark
calling
this
a
bock
is
a
crime
head
retention
turns
out
to
be
excellent
as
is
the
lacing
has
a
little
bit
of
a
butterscotch
taste
similar
to
newcastle
brown
ale
its
pretty
good
beer
it
is
easy
to
polish
off
a
12pack
without
even
trying
goes
down
good
very
satisfying
beer
taste
its
affordable
too
at
least
here
in
texas
you
can
buy
12
for
10
99
at
your
local
grocery
store
great
because
you
can
slowly
enjoy
the
first
few
and
continue
to
pound
them
all
night
pours
a
clear
amber
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
yeast
cleanliness
some
pale
malt
and
maybe
some
slight
sweet
malt
wow
the
aroma
is
decidedly
lacking
i
guess
it
fits
the
style
of
a
bock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
cleanliness
up
front
then
some
pale
malt
comes
through
the
slightest
hop
is
noticeable
only
very
quickly
and
the
finish
is
a
hint
of
earthy
malt
overall
this
brew
is
a
little
watery
i
remember
this
brew
being
much
better
than
this
oh
well
this
is
not
really
worth
a
try
on
the
plus
side
it
does
get
better
as
you
go
along
it
poured
redish
in
color
and
did
not
have
a
memorable
smell
it
was
a
bit
carmaly
in
taste
and
decent
beer
i
used
to
drink
it
exclusevly
but
overall
this
one
is
a
pretty
good
go
to
beer
never
dissapointed
in
it
would
love
to
drink
this
one
a
little
more
as
far
as
a
good
go
to
beer
pretty
easy
going
beer
not
will
always
go
with
this
one
id
seen
a
fair
bit
of
criticism
leveled
at
this
beer
so
being
the
skeptic
that
i
am
i
went
in
and
really
tried
to
like
this
beer
however
i
just
couldnt
bring
myself
to
do
so
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
its
just
a
lot
shallower
than
i
like
my
bocks
to
be
may
be
good
for
someone
looking
to
get
away
from
inferior
beers
but
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
for
myself
again
not
like
any
other
bock
ive
had
its
like
a
poor
macro
version
of
a
bock
i
dont
know
what
all
of
the
hype
is
about
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
to
the
point
that
it
makes
me
feel
gassy
i
could
drink
a
few
at
a
bbq
but
just
to
have
one
for
the
hell
of
it
no
way
overall
i
was
a
little
bummed
on
this
one
had
heard
a
lot
about
shiner
in
texas
but
was
let
down
d
not
bad
but
there
are
better
bocks
out
there
give
this
beer
more
depth
body
and
overall
bock
character
and
its
on
its
way
to
a
good
bock
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
deep
copper
color
with
a
large
but
rapidly
diminishing
offwhite
head
aroma
is
adjuncts
bready
malts
and
metal
flavor
is
bready
and
semisweet
no
hops
no
complexity
very
simplistic
but
tasty
enough
mediumthin
body
with
nice
carbonation
tastes
more
like
a
munich
lager
than
a
bock
definitely
not
robust
enough
to
claim
the
bock
style
very
easy
to
drink
d
a
step
up
from
bmc
but
disappointing
after
trying
the
anchor
bock
pours
a
brownred
colored
body
pretty
clearish
looking
with
nearly
no
head
offwhite
in
color
has
a
nutty
maybe
fruity
or
grainy
aroma
effervescent
has
a
pretty
weak
taste
some
nuttiness
with
a
watery
palate
not
much
flavor
here
overall
a
fair
beer
that
is
just
a
tad
better
than
a
bmc
when
i
moved
to
texas
16
years
ago
i
feel
in
love
with
this
beer
this
was
the
beer
that
got
me
beyond
bmcs
and
eventually
on
to
even
better
beers
i
have
definitely
moved
past
this
one
over
the
years
though
also
i
swear
and
several
forum
posts
claim
it
as
well
that
it
tastes
different
than
it
did
a
decade
ago
shiner
says
its
the
same
but
it
doesnt
taste
the
same
i
also
find
the
quality
to
be
wildly
erratic
dont
recommend
unless
you
are
just
now
leaving
the
bmcs
for
me
i
have
the
rare
one
for
nostalgia
this
one
is
pretty
average
in
a
world
of
blind
men
a
oneeyed
man
is
king
in
a
bar
with
only
american
adjunct
lagers
and
light
lagers
this
beer
is
king
fortunately
maggies
had
gi
honkers
ale
and
312
guinness
magic
hat
no
9
and
a
few
other
craft
brews
so
a
single
pint
of
shiner
bock
for
the
record
was
enough
for
the
night
and
i
enjoyed
far
more
worthy
quaffs
from
then
on
really
comes
down
to
a
warm
weather
brew
not
a
lot
to
speak
of
in
the
flavour
department
but
could
be
refreshing
in
the
texan
heat
drinkability
if
it
wasnt
almost
90
degrees
out
there
and
im
doing
yard
work
i
would
not
drink
it
but
lets
face
it
it
is
better
than
h2o
this
beer
is
a
victim
of
circumstance
having
had
numerous
bocks
before
reviewing
shiner
it
simply
doesnt
compare
in
smell
drinkability
or
most
importantly
taste
its
not
a
bad
beer
slighty
bland
for
a
bock
however
it
does
smell
decent
as
some
sweet
malty
scents
do
escape
upon
pouring
taste
as
i
said
is
a
bit
bland
some
richness
comes
through
but
not
much
chalk
it
up
as
you
get
what
you
pay
for
shiner
was
my
gateway
beer
into
this
ba
world
but
since
ive
widened
my
variety
in
beer
in
the
last
year
its
caused
me
to
think
very
little
of
this
beer
i
seriously
dont
know
how
i
ever
liked
this
d
this
is
not
recommended
the
only
purpose
a
beer
like
this
serves
is
to
be
that
baby
step
for
people
who
think
that
anything
that
comes
in
a
bottle
is
fancy
highend
stuff
very
overhyped
for
such
a
mediocre
beer
this
is
an
ok
beer
when
youre
at
a
bar
with
few
choices
but
almost
everywhere
has
sam
adams
or
blue
moon
those
are
both
much
better
choices
than
this
a
pitiful
excuse
for
a
bock
i
suppose
it
might
be
a
good
one
for
the
bmc
crowd
as
it
has
pretty
much
no
flavor
but
is
ghastly
dark
in
color
poured
into
12oz
glass
poured
a
clear
deep
amber
color
with
about
an
inch
of
slightly
offwhite
head
that
left
no
lacing
basic
semisweet
malt
aroma
a
fundamentally
solid
flavor
with
no
outstanding
characteristics
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
slight
tang
on
the
finish
typical
light
body
very
good
drinkability
but
most
bocks
do
an
average
example
of
the
style
try
one
if
you
see
it
or
if
youre
stuck
someplace
with
fizzy
yellow
beers
and
this
you
will
be
happy
with
shiner
bock
overall
not
bad
had
it
on
tap
as
the
guestbrew
at
the
brewerie
in
erie
pa
an
easy
crowd
pleaser
good
with
a
meal
or
to
session
very
well
rounded
but
nothing
too
intense
in
either
direction
good
or
bad
average
brew
id
take
another
one
if
offered
for
sure
clear
dark
amber
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
settles
into
a
thin
collar
light
toasted
grain
with
an
herbal
kind
of
quality
in
the
nose
tastes
mild
and
well
balanced
between
light
biscuit
malt
and
hop
bitterness
light
seltzery
mouthfeel
squeaky
clean
and
easy
drinking
decent
session
beer
this
beer
pours
a
perfectly
clear
medium
golden
brown
with
a
few
fingers
of
off
white
head
that
falls
away
very
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
the
smell
is
malt
grainy
spicy
a
bit
of
rye
the
taste
is
very
light
a
bready
biscuity
malt
and
a
slight
floral
essence
the
carbonation
is
prickly
at
first
but
mellows
out
making
this
fairly
smooth
the
body
is
quite
thin
the
taste
inoffensive
kind
of
bland
but
i
could
see
having
a
few
rounds
of
this
given
no
better
options
d
i
think
the
only
way
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
is
if
it
were
free
and
there
were
no
other
beer
available
reminds
me
of
cheap
yellow
beer
masquerading
as
dark
beer
there
is
very
little
to
taste
here
maybe
a
few
hints
of
toasty
malts
and
a
bit
of
graininess
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
watery
its
ok
but
far
from
spoetzls
best
offering
unfortunately
is
it
the
most
widely
distributed
it
does
go
down
easy
and
preferable
over
a
bmc
but
it
is
hard
to
rate
this
very
high
as
a
bock
but
at
least
it
goes
down
easy
i
guess
thats
something
bottom
line
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
dark
beer
its
a
good
introduction
to
dark
beer
for
novices
good
malty
taste
and
lightly
hopped
better
for
my
money
than
michelob
amber
bock
for
this
style
american
bock
beer
slightly
sweet
taste
but
not
cloying
good
lighter
american
style
bock
beer
mouthfeel
decent
overall
a
b
minus
here
a
gateway
to
better
things
very
good
session
beer
i
like
it
but
its
too
expensive
in
east
tennessee
7
a
six
pack
on
my
old
list
just
of
what
i
tried
i
have
this
marked
as
good
i
dont
know
what
i
was
thinking
not
much
punch
so
i
am
sure
i
could
have
a
few
i
might
buy
it
again
if
i
want
to
introduce
someone
to
the
quirkiness
of
death
proof
on
dvd
or
i
might
try
it
on
tap
if
im
ever
again
in
texas
and
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
freebie
otherwise
im
unlikely
to
visit
this
brew
again
d
i
will
never
ever
drink
this
again
drinkability
very
very
easy
and
smooth
a
decent
session
beer
and
goos
transfer
beer
but
overall
averga
efor
beer
adovcates
not
much
better
than
amberbock
in
sum
im
never
gonna
buy
it
at
the
liquor
store
when
there
are
better
options
but
its
a
great
quality
brew
and
in
texas
its
somewhat
of
a
savior
when
your
out
for
pizza
i
picked
this
up
at
the
local
hilo
on
the
westside
in
hopes
that
it
might
remind
me
of
warm
spring
days
after
shoveling
10
inches
of
snow
and
ice
off
my
driveway
i
can
say
this
bock
did
not
let
me
down
it
is
malty
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
is
it
a
heavyhitter
all
time
great
not
really
it
is
a
bit
watery
with
no
head
retention
please
please
groundhog
dont
see
your
shadow
spring
cannot
get
here
soon
enough
atmosphere
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
but
flavor
and
feel
are
okay
making
for
good
drinkability
decent
quaff
not
much
more
to
add
that
500
people
havent
said
before
poured
a
medium
and
clear
amber
color
with
a
larger
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
some
earthiness
roasted
caramel
and
nuts
tastes
of
the
same
but
thinner
and
somewhat
watery
body
was
thin
and
watery
as
well
d
being
from
texas
this
was
a
staple
for
me
like
others
for
many
years
i
hold
this
beer
close
to
my
heart
so
for
that
reason
it
will
always
be
a
winner
from
a
straight
beer
perspective
there
is
nothing
particularly
special
about
this
i
still
think
it
is
a
pretty
solid
delivery
and
i
was
glad
to
see
it
has
made
it
as
far
up
as
wa
state
kudos
to
spoetzl
brewery
great
for
a
long
session
i
love
bocks
so
i
was
excited
to
try
shiners
the
beer
poured
a
very
clear
brown
with
accents
of
redish
orange
very
weak
head
for
a
bock
with
very
active
carbonation
the
smell
was
dissapointing
as
it
didnt
smell
like
much
at
all
some
faint
aromas
of
oat
malt
and
some
sweetness
the
taste
was
better
than
the
smell
and
apearance
the
taste
was
malty
and
with
some
sweetness
of
molasses
or
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
but
at
the
expense
of
much
carbonation
shiner
bock
is
easy
to
drink
because
it
is
watered
down
compared
to
other
bocks
all
in
all
i
would
probably
pass
on
this
if
i
saw
it
again
cant
say
much
more
than
that
not
any
obvious
flaws
that
i
can
pick
up
but
nothing
coming
right
out
and
saying
drink
me
again
drinkability
a
plain
dull
lager
but
when
you
throw
in
that
metallic
mouthful
of
nickels
and
pennies
youve
totally
lost
me
this
is
always
a
crowd
pleaser
not
the
best
beer
you
can
find
on
the
shelves
but
has
a
good
appeal
to
the
general
public
always
a
safe
bet
overall
pleasant
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
might
become
cloying
after
a
couple
still
better
than
a
lot
of
offerings
so
really
depends
on
what
else
is
available
pours
clear
brown
colour
with
offwhite
head
which
dissapeared
almost
immediately
smell
not
too
much
here
malty
with
some
medicinelike
notes
taste
malts
mostly
with
some
toasted
sugar
perhaps
watery
very
light
nice
level
of
carbonation
its
drinkable
as
it
very
light
but
really
its
net
that
good
of
a
beer
its
not
awful
but
with
so
many
options
over
there
d
its
always
in
my
fridge
a
decent
session
beer
dif
anything
it
was
drinkable
just
like
mineral
water
is
drinkable
im
let
down
by
my
own
analysis
i
guess
i
really
never
gave
this
beer
a
good
going
over
miller
lite
with
food
coloring
clear
tan
tan
fizzy
small
head
corny
aroma
some
hints
of
malt
and
metal
shiner
and
their
metal
i
wonder
what
the
taste
has
in
store
for
me
corn
corn
syrup
brown
sugar
and
metal
how
is
this
a
bock
beer
i
remember
a
friend
from
texas
touting
this
great
beer
i
should
have
remembered
he
loved
lone
star
too
d
this
runs
at
a
relatively
premium
price
but
offers
little
in
the
way
of
complexity
id
probably
downgrade
to
a
cheaper
beer
if
i
just
wanted
something
to
drink
or
upgrade
to
a
better
one
if
i
wanted
something
to
enjoy
not
a
very
good
balance
d
something
you
can
drink
regularly
and
frequently
over
the
course
of
a
night
note
i
should
also
add
that
shiner
offers
other
brews
that
are
much
better
than
this
in
other
words
dont
totally
throw
out
the
brewery
itself
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
also
not
that
great
first
off
this
isnt
a
true
bock
i
dont
know
if
its
a
requirement
to
be
from
texas
to
like
this
beer
but
i
just
cant
see
why
everybody
gets
so
into
it
average
aroma
decent
pour
not
very
much
head
not
very
much
lace
taste
is
malty
a
little
bit
sweet
but
is
killed
by
being
too
watery
very
light
bodied
overall
not
a
terrible
beer
but
in
the
battle
of
fake
bocks
michelobs
amber
bock
is
actually
more
enjoyable
i
have
no
desire
to
ever
try
this
again
slainte
2
5
d
if
this
cost
as
much
as
a
cheap
macro
id
buy
it
to
get
drunk
off
of
this
definitely
isnt
a
dinner
beer
or
a
relaxation
beer
pours
a
thinlooking
medium
brown
with
hardly
any
head
and
appears
pretty
lowlycarbonated
smells
of
a
solid
malt
the
taste
is
a
solid
malt
but
nothing
special
perhaps
a
little
weak
compared
to
other
bocks
ive
had
its
got
a
nice
little
matly
aftertaste
as
well
that
lingers
a
bit
i
dont
mean
to
knock
it
too
badits
a
solid
brew
for
a
macro
its
got
some
body
and
its
got
some
flavor
and
isnt
too
sour
its
nothing
special
but
its
not
horrible
shiner
bock
is
one
pisspoor
excuse
for
a
craft
bock
amber
bock
trumps
this
any
day
of
the
week
despite
being
wholly
average
no
wonder
i
cant
sell
this
shit
d
shiner
bock
isnt
terrible
but
at
the
same
time
isnt
something
i
would
purchase
again
but
in
no
way
is
this
good
beer
has
a
good
body
lighter
than
most
other
bocks
but
still
enjoyable
nothing
special
about
this
beer
really
sort
of
a
golden
amber
color
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no
trace
of
lacing
whatsoever
smell
is
somewhat
malty
and
grainy
taste
is
nearly
the
same
very
thin
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
though
just
because
it
seems
so
light
not
a
recommendation
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
there
is
an
initial
tang
that
isnt
very
recognizable
definitely
a
do
not
buy
this
was
my
first
real
beer
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
gateway
beer
for
beginners
to
real
beer
if
nothing
else
this
one
is
growing
on
me
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
chesnut
color
with
a
thin
white
head
there
is
not
much
that
i
can
smell
just
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
the
up
front
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
perhaps
a
hint
of
raisin
but
it
fades
quickly
all
this
being
said
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
if
you
are
in
search
of
this
style
shiner
is
not
a
great
example
drinkability
is
good
its
not
an
exciting
but
highly
swillable
bock
which
isnt
something
im
particularly
looking
for
but
im
sure
it
has
its
place
oh
yeah
texas
cheers
poured
a
nice
amber
color
but
with
very
little
head
smell
of
a
bocksort
of
with
a
hint
of
adjunct
this
is
a
smooth
brew
and
does
go
down
pretty
good
but
if
youre
looking
for
an
original
bock
taste
you
will
be
a
little
dissapointed
i
have
had
many
different
varieties
of
bocks
and
was
excited
to
see
a
cheap
one
but
it
was
kind
of
obvious
why
it
is
cheap
michelob
amberbock
is
actually
a
better
bock
and
has
a
little
more
alcohol
i
believesince
a
bock
should
have
at
least
5
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
something
that
i
would
tell
you
to
go
out
and
get
now
because
you
are
missing
something
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
also
not
that
great
expecting
more
from
this
style
and
this
tastes
no
different
than
a
vienna
lager
would
have
again
if
offered
and
nothing
else
available
d
on
the
whole
a
very
uninteresting
beer
it
doesnt
dare
to
be
anything
but
mediocre
drinkability
easy
drinking
nothing
special
decent
beer
md
a
little
thin
on
the
feel
goes
down
crisp
and
clean
though
very
drinkable
overall
an
american
lager
but
a
smart
pick
for
a
bock
this
brew
has
very
subtle
characteristics
all
around
however
this
beer
will
make
for
a
nice
session
brew
becauseeven
though
it
is
a
bock
it
doesnt
overwhelm
considering
where
i
was
this
was
easily
the
best
choice
going
on
a
decent
beer
to
drink
in
the
sweltering
heat
but
id
rather
reach
for
other
bocks
or
beers
probably
better
on
tap
texas
strikes
again
this
classic
was
a
clear
amber
color
out
of
the
bottle
but
the
white
head
was
shorter
lived
than
billy
blanks
career
who
no
lacing
either
the
aroma
was
very
clean
almost
to
the
point
of
being
nonexistent
grains
and
dry
husk
the
flavors
were
thankfully
better
defined
some
malt
and
malted
sweetness
along
with
hints
of
astringent
hops
that
nip
at
the
palate
a
little
nothing
bold
but
very
crisp
and
quite
refreshing
very
light
body
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
much
like
beer
flavored
seltzer
water
good
summer
beer
and
sessionable
even
if
not
inspired
overall
tried
it
oldschool
bloc
bock
deep
in
the
heart
of
texas
the
idea
is
backwards
but
has
spirit
this
is
a
decent
beer
worth
the
effort
buy
it
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
in
the
flavor
just
dont
expect
anything
too
fantastic
its
810
per
6pack
i
recall
not
worth
it
the
shiner
black
is
better
the
beer
poured
from
the
bottle
a
deep
amber
color
with
wispy
foam
above
it
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
molasses
it
makes
me
think
sweetness
lies
ahead
fairly
carbonated
on
the
palate
the
flavor
isnt
overly
sweet
but
rather
like
strange
askew
caramel
topping
over
a
slightly
buttery
biscuit
this
beer
could
use
some
work
in
the
flavor
department
and
also
a
bit
of
balance
would
be
desirable
i
am
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
six
pack
dability
smooth
but
bland
dark
lager
drinkable
but
there
are
better
options
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
appetizing
mahogany
not
much
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
fruity
undertone
apple
or
pear
flavor
is
mainly
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
touches
of
sweetness
hops
and
nutty
taste
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
like
cola
superthin
and
watery
crisp
dry
and
lame
an
easy
drinker
as
it
is
virtually
devoid
of
body
or
flavor
that
might
otherwise
taste
like
something
and
annoy
the
drinker
d
not
my
favorite
ok
as
a
session
brew
but
not
something
id
pick
over
other
offerings
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
is
a
decent
alternative
to
your
fizzy
yellow
beers
however
this
beer
doesnt
have
enough
to
it
that
will
make
me
choose
it
over
too
many
other
craft
beers
drinkability
its
too
bad
ive
discovered
good
beer
unfortunatley
this
is
not
one
of
them
but
if
i
was
a
rebel
flag
waving
tattooed
biker
guy
id
down
a
case
of
these
and
still
not
have
a
buzz
try
again
shiner
poured
to
a
nice
head
that
disappated
very
fast
not
what
i
expected
beer
was
more
brownish
than
gold
in
color
no
lacing
at
all
smelled
slightly
sweet
and
thats
about
it
had
a
very
mild
smell
maybe
a
hint
of
caramel
tasted
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
no
flavors
hung
around
felt
very
thin
in
the
mouth
almost
watery
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
a
little
excessive
i
wanted
to
try
the
spoetzl
brewery
products
and
did
my
first
impression
wasnt
very
good
while
this
bock
obviously
underwhelms
it
isnt
all
that
bad
i
wonder
if
the
brewers
used
even
a
single
decoction
mash
traidtionally
bocks
get
thier
color
malt
profile
and
flavor
from
a
triple
decoction
mash
and
a
very
long
boil
shiners
bock
is
typical
what
many
brewers
today
brew
it
isnt
bad
as
far
as
beer
goes
but
for
purists
it
has
a
ways
to
go
cool
label
shiner
bock
pours
a
brilliant
translucent
redbrown
color
a
very
vocal
white
sodalike
head
forms
and
dissapears
very
quickly
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
are
stuck
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
kind
of
boring
the
nose
gives
notes
of
semisweet
toasted
malts
and
a
subtle
applecherry
fruit
aroma
also
some
caramel
and
chocolate
as
it
warms
the
shiner
bock
is
very
light
in
flavor
initially
malts
nuts
chocolate
and
booze
at
first
that
basically
show
up
and
disappear
as
fast
as
its
head
did
there
is
a
slight
hop
bite
just
before
the
finish
but
the
aftertaste
is
slow
long
and
lingering
of
funky
fruity
malt
and
burnt
chocolatey
grain
not
too
great
its
light
enough
to
drink
easily
lots
of
hype
here
about
this
beer
finally
making
it
to
michigan
not
sure
what
the
big
deal
is
pours
a
very
bocklike
light
brown
not
too
dark
trying
to
coax
some
aroma
out
of
this
by
swirling
around
in
the
glass
but
not
getting
much
basic
maltyeast
beer
smell
lack
of
complex
aromas
indicates
a
basic
beer
with
no
exceptional
ingredients
or
brewing
processes
happening
flavor
is
sweet
light
malts
light
caramel
slightly
more
complex
fruit
flavor
in
the
finish
sweet
dark
raisin
with
a
twist
of
sour
cherry
wishing
the
beer
was
more
crisp
and
clean
as
it
would
redeem
it
a
bit
but
im
just
not
getting
it
a
beer
this
thin
should
be
more
refreshing
as
the
guy
who
recommended
this
was
from
texas
i
thought
hed
be
recommending
me
a
big
strong
beer
not
exactly
poured
a
brownishamber
that
left
a
large
head
and
good
lacings
a
faint
smell
of
hops
on
the
nose
left
little
to
the
smell
a
mediumbodied
brew
that
has
some
toastedroasted
malts
and
a
sweetness
that
is
a
little
syrupy
like
caramel
goes
down
smooth
with
some
biting
hops
but
for
a
bock
it
is
not
nearly
strong
enough
to
hang
around
with
the
big
boys
i
have
never
had
a
shiner
before
but
i
guess
i
might
have
expected
a
little
more
out
of
the
bock
than
i
was
given
everything
about
it
was
o
k
but
thats
about
it
i
mean
i
could
definitley
drink
this
again
but
if
given
an
option
i
probably
would
not
this
beer
is
lighter
than
most
bocks
ive
had
seems
a
bit
thin
and
has
little
head
the
odor
reminds
me
of
when
i
tried
to
make
a
bock
style
beer
with
a
mr
beer
kit
it
didnt
quite
come
out
right
theres
an
overly
sweet
almost
cidery
smell
it
certainly
tastes
better
than
my
mr
beer
attempt
but
by
bock
standards
it
falls
quite
short
its
a
bit
too
pale
and
flavorlacking
it
seems
closer
to
a
dunkel
style
than
a
bock
its
kind
of
maltysugary
sweet
with
not
very
much
hop
bitterness
at
all
its
thin
and
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
not
bad
beer
just
not
a
good
bock
bottom
line
not
a
great
beer
but
a
bargain
widely
available
in
texas
better
alternative
to
macrobrews
pours
a
dark
maple
syrup
color
with
a
puney
little
kakhi
head
that
left
no
lacing
as
it
rapidly
vanished
this
smells
faintly
of
sweet
honey
wheat
breadlacking
in
much
aromas
at
all
some
lightly
toasted
malts
are
mostly
what
i
detect
in
this
overall
boaring
brewwith
not
a
bit
of
hops
noticed
slightly
sweetfaint
caramel
and
brown
sugar
the
body
is
light
and
fairly
smoothecarbonation
is
acceptable
better
than
the
last
shinerblondebut
it
wont
keep
me
coming
back
d
the
lighter
style
made
it
an
easier
drinker
but
i
was
expecting
a
more
fullflavored
bock
so
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
made
me
want
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
d
a
staple
beer
in
texas
which
most
people
enjoy
but
i
actually
go
for
the
miller
lite
now
instead
of
shiner
if
those
are
my
choices
d
this
is
a
very
nice
and
simple
beer
that
is
better
than
runofthemill
would
make
a
great
session
beer
so
no
up
here
in
the
midwest
i
probably
wont
have
this
again
but
if
im
visiting
houston
and
the
only
other
taps
are
miller
lite
and
some
bud
hell
yes
ill
take
a
couple
pints
of
shiner
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
when
i
was
in
my
infancy
of
getting
into
better
beer
thinking
it
was
one
of
the
sweetest
heaviest
things
id
had
next
to
guinness
i
dont
know
much
about
bock
beers
but
this
is
little
more
than
an
american
macro
with
an
added
toasted
component
mouthfeel
is
crisply
carbonated
balanced
bitterness
with
sweet
malts
d
pour
me
another
pours
a
good
amber
with
traces
of
golden
brown
a
thin
fizzy
head
rises
up
and
falls
with
steady
carbonation
smell
is
somewhat
muted
and
of
light
grains
and
sweet
caramel
malt
very
light
taste
is
pretty
good
and
clean
mild
bitterness
with
flavors
of
caramel
and
a
doughy
biscuity
bread
good
light
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
and
pretty
refreshing
smooth
and
easy
enough
to
drink
just
not
much
going
on
here
not
sure
why
i
bought
a
single
of
this
but
i
didnt
hate
it
at
all
so
more
power
to
it
yeah
you
could
probably
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
but
for
7
50
a
six
why
would
you
want
to
there
are
plenty
of
actual
bocks
to
be
had
for
the
price
on
the
bottle
it
says
shiner
bock
combines
its
oldworld
bavarian
heritage
with
the
ingenuity
of
american
handcraft
brewing
which
by
that
they
mean
we
took
a
traditional
celebratory
german
brew
and
turned
into
something
that
tastes
like
bud
d
fairly
smooth
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
maybe
thats
just
because
it
was
the
first
beer
of
the
night
i
dont
care
if
this
beer
isnt
the
best
beer
ever
its
a
classic
in
my
land
and
this
used
to
be
my
expensive
classy
beer
back
in
the
day
before
my
real
beer
awakening
m
d
a
little
thin
but
a
reasonable
dryness
to
finish
which
is
alright
its
certainly
a
sessionable
drink
but
probably
not
for
my
taste
i
would
certainly
go
elsewhere
for
a
refreshing
brew
even
to
use
as
lawnmower
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
decently
carbonated
very
little
aroma
some
slight
sweetness
but
not
much
going
on
tasted
like
it
had
a
lot
of
adjunct
grains
corn
or
rice
very
bland
lightbodied
and
not
much
of
a
malt
backbone
to
it
drinkability
is
okay
but
expected
for
something
this
bland
d
since
it
tastes
like
a
glass
of
water
you
can
knock
it
down
easily
d
we
finished
the
keg
so
i
would
say
it
is
drinkable
it
is
nice
change
from
any
dominant
macro
that
is
for
sure
good
attempt
from
a
german
brewery
in
texas
but
i
prefer
their
hefe
this
is
certainly
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
nor
the
greatest
bock
hell
it
might
not
even
be
a
bock
but
still
i
have
a
very
warm
place
in
my
heart
for
shiner
bock
it
rescues
me
time
and
time
again
out
in
here
the
outback
of
american
beer
culture
what
a
great
session
beer
pours
with
a
dark
mahogany
color
that
belies
its
easy
drinkability
the
smell
is
a
subtle
maltiness
with
slight
hops
bitters
the
taste
is
light
with
malty
sweetness
perfectly
balanced
by
the
bitterness
and
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
d
this
does
not
drink
like
a
bock
style
beer
seems
to
be
more
of
a
brown
ale
with
a
little
tweaking
would
probably
make
a
very
good
brown
ale
appearance
was
that
of
a
glass
of
iced
tea
sans
ice
or
maybe
brown
dishwater
no
head
whatsoever
aroma
very
faint
smell
of
grains
flavor
was
weak
malt
and
water
not
necessarily
in
that
order
carbonation
was
stronger
than
expected
which
seemed
to
give
some
semblance
of
body
to
an
otherwise
thin
and
lifeless
brew
and
ill
give
it
an
extra
half
a
point
for
drinkability
simply
because
i
actually
had
two
although
im
still
not
sure
why
i
ordered
the
second
one
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
just
not
very
interesting
so
far
i
have
yet
to
have
a
really
good
beer
from
texas
d
not
half
bad
gentle
and
unassuming
very
quenching
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
shiner
d
easy
to
drink
maybe
a
step
up
from
a
macrolager
was
hoping
for
more
from
a
bock
but
the
2nd
3rd
went
down
great
with
bbq
ribs
i
have
revisited
this
in
oct
2012
and
found
it
if
anything
even
more
unimpressive
than
before
i
have
tried
some
new
shiner
beers
and
revisited
ones
from
before
in
the
recent
weeks
and
as
before
find
that
shinerspoetzl
produces
some
good
beer
but
that
ironically
this
flagship
beer
of
theirs
is
possibly
their
worst
beer
i
have
downgraded
the
taste
score
from
2
to
1
5
it
is
simply
almost
utterly
tasteless
with
only
a
very
fleeting
hint
of
flavour
that
vanishes
abruptly
to
dry
nothingness
it
does
not
taste
bad
it
simply
has
almost
no
character
at
all
i
compare
this
to
their
hefeweizen
which
is
great
and
their
kosmos
reserve
lager
which
is
really
good
drinkability
is
good
but
wouldnt
really
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
this
beer
is
extremely
mediocre
although
i
feel
like
thats
probably
pretty
well
known
on
this
site
youre
probably
all
coming
around
here
reviewing
it
for
the
same
reason
i
am
you
stumbled
on
it
amber
color
with
a
weak
head
and
no
lacing
nose
is
mild
mostly
malt
and
grain
taste
is
likewise
maybe
some
other
adjuncts
in
there
as
well
feel
is
too
thin
but
not
terrible
overall
i
had
it
not
expecting
much
and
got
what
i
expected
d
could
take
a
whole
case
of
these
back
with
me
easy
go
to
favorite
from
shiner
so
far
mouthfeel
is
only
average
there
isnt
much
carbonation
and
its
tastes
kind
of
watered
down
and
slightly
synthetic
this
blahness
makes
it
a
less
drinkable
beer
in
my
book
i
am
initially
intrigued
by
it
only
to
be
disappointed
by
the
whole
package
it
pours
a
nice
dark
copper
color
and
i
will
admit
the
keg
taste
better
than
the
bottle
i
am
reviewing
the
draft
because
it
has
close
to
the
same
nose
but
there
is
some
spicyness
to
it
from
the
keg
somewhat
of
a
bite
its
really
good
for
being
a
darker
beer
it
goes
done
really
well
on
a
hot
day
d
easy
to
drink
too
many
and
still
feel
great
d
ok
to
drink
nothing
really
stood
out
other
than
the
carbonation
not
my
bag
compared
to
other
macrobrews
on
tap
in
texas
shiner
bock
takes
the
cake
of
course
in
the
summer
its
time
for
shiner
hefeweizen
compared
to
other
bocks
however
it
lacks
the
depth
to
make
the
top
tier
pours
a
very
clear
weak
browncopper
color
with
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
there
is
really
no
scent
beyond
an
extremely
slight
maltiness
taste
is
also
weak
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
but
thats
about
it
it
does
go
down
fairly
smooth
but
thats
its
best
attribute
it
has
almost
no
bock
attributes
at
all
this
bock
is
nothing
like
the
real
thing
sort
of
like
a
pbr
with
caramel
coloring
actually
gives
bock
a
bad
name
quite
unimpressive
across
the
board
not
offensive
but
not
very
beer
like
i
would
definitely
drink
this
vs
bmc
and
think
it
would
make
a
great
kegger
beer
but
decidedly
weak
within
the
style
this
is
one
of
my
favoritesdark
in
color
small
nice
head
very
nice
sort
of
fruity
hop
smell
taste
is
very
refreshing
to
me
and
calls
for
more
then
one
nice
smooth
feel
in
your
mouth
no
after
taste
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
it
a
very
mild
favorful
bock
with
out
any
harshness
and
at
a
nice
price
too
drinkablity
good
flavor
in
such
a
light
bodied
brew
d
easy
enough
to
drink
but
many
better
beers
are
around
and
this
is
far
from
a
bock
i
think
i
actually
prefer
michelob
amber
bock
to
this
d
i
had
high
expectations
from
this
beer
since
i
didnt
know
anything
about
it
or
its
brewery
but
i
was
sadly
dissapointed
by
a
beer
that
doesnt
taste
much
better
from
your
typical
macro
if
i
closed
my
eyes
id
swear
i
was
drinking
a
macro
with
a
dash
of
dark
malt
too
light
to
be
considered
a
real
bock
and
just
enough
weird
flavor
to
steer
you
away
if
tasteless
refreshment
is
on
your
mind
its
a
loselose
proposition
d
does
down
easy
just
wish
there
was
more
flavor
on
reflection
i
think
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
1
99
was
an
ok
price
although
they
have
the
balls
to
charge
premium
price
for
this
stuff
in
a
lot
of
bars
d
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
that
is
refreshing
its
nothing
special
flavorwise
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
i
find
i
enjoy
certain
foods
with
lighter
beers
and
this
fits
the
bill
better
than
most
of
the
big
guys
it
is
a
good
beer
i
enjoy
the
flavor
and
the
smell
greatly
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
appearance
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
beverage
in
the
future
to
ensure
that
i
did
not
just
have
a
bad
bottle
i
had
this
both
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
its
pretty
ubiquitous
in
texas
the
beer
has
zero
and
i
mean
zero
head
with
no
lacing
it
looks
tawny
brown
sticky
and
slightly
watery
the
smell
was
dextrin
malt
cloying
not
that
enticing
the
taste
was
quite
metallic
malty
there
is
a
not
all
that
pleasant
caramel
taste
perhaps
a
little
diacetyl
the
beer
has
little
carbonation
and
is
light
bodied
i
wouldnt
have
another
overall
its
not
bad
tasting
much
more
flavor
than
i
expected
but
overbalanced
on
the
sweet
side
its
better
than
the
macros
d
goes
down
like
water
wait
was
this
water
this
is
just
such
a
light
diet
cokelike
beverage
very
little
appreciable
taste
or
aroma
make
it
a
purely
thirstquenching
drunkgetting
kinda
beer
yeah
id
choose
the
lovable
shiner
over
some
of
the
other
big
name
lagers
but
abs
ziegenbock
is
a
better
choice
albeit
not
my
top
choice
i
would
have
another
it
isnt
offensive
i
dont
yearn
for
another
but
if
it
is
there
and
i
want
a
beer
and
i
dont
mind
wasting
my
carbcalorie
intake
on
just
anything
this
will
be
ok
the
beer
arrived
with
a
very
thin
white
head
that
disappeared
very
quickly
there
really
wasnt
much
of
a
smell
to
speak
of
the
taste
had
little
real
flavor
with
a
touch
of
malt
and
a
whisper
of
hops
in
the
background
it
had
a
soft
drink
like
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
but
it
was
reasonably
drinkable
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
i
have
had
this
on
tap
before
and
it
is
better
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
though
is
fairly
inconsistent
every
brew
is
very
different
d
incredibly
disappointing
bock
this
is
a
very
faint
and
pale
comparison
to
its
european
roots
its
drinkable
but
barely
very
bland
in
nature
appearance
is
amber
but
kinda
bland
smell
not
a
whole
lot
a
little
caramel
taste
not
as
watery
as
a
macro
but
not
a
whole
lot
there
the
drinkability
is
its
high
point
i
it
goes
down
easy
on
a
warm
texas
day
id
rather
save
a
few
bucks
and
have
a
budweiser
on
any
occasion
though
but
i
dont
have
a
problem
drinking
an
occasional
shiner
or
two
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
one
finger
head
disappeared
rather
quickly
dark
amber
color
with
the
faint
sweet
smell
of
malt
overall
taste
was
about
average
to
me
no
overpowering
taste
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
to
the
finish
quite
honestly
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
to
it
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
beers
which
as
a
local
beer
is
a
little
different
and
kind
of
a
novelty
which
goes
national
its
really
more
of
a
mass
market
type
beer
than
a
craft
brew
if
im
texas
i
am
checking
this
place
out
and
drinking
some
local
brew
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
at
my
local
beer
distributor
smells
of
malt

with
perhaps
a
tiny
hint
of
hops

a
dark
brown
clearish
color
with
a
bit
of
head
carbonated
well
with
a
fairly
subdued
taste
at
first
then
a
sweet
smooth
malt
finish
fairly
light
bodied
overall
easy
to
drink
12

color
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
head
retention
is
low
lacing
is
ok
it
smells
like
toasted
malt
and
caramel
the
aroma
is
light
but
nice
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
although
theres
also
a
grainy
taste
too
as
with
the
aroma
the
taste
is
sweet
and
on
the
light
side
but
its
not
bad
at
all
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
with
average
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
drinkability
is
decent
i
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
if
there
wasnt
anything
better
available
overall
its
an
ok
beer
its
not
great
but
certainly
not
awful
either
not
very
bitter
can
be
a
session
beer
on
a
warm
day
not
a
hot
day
a
big
difference
in
central
texas
d
definitely
easy
drinking
and
decent
on
its
own
while
not
a
big
fan
easy
to
see
why
it
is
mass
produced
now
i
dont
think
that
i
would
really
buy
this
one
again
as
there
are
plenty
of
other
great
beers
out
there
to
try
not
exactly
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
just
didnt
enjoy
this
one
there
are
some
who
will
probably
really
like
this
beer
im
just
not
one
of
them

taste
is
sweet
to
start
with
a

a
very

sessionable

clear

very
light
kind
of
a
toasty
grain
with
a
faint
hop
aroma
taste
is
about
like
michelob
amber
bock
not
great
and
not
bad
it
is
worth
drinking
in
establishments
that
have
great
food
but
limited
beer
selections
although
around
here
those
kinds
of
places
also
have
something
from
great
lakes
and
everything
from
gl
is
better
than
this
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
with
good
head
with
lots
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
yeasty
with
a
slight
sweet
tone
flavor
is
bordering
on
wooden
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
and
a
slight
bitter
tone
feel
is
pretty
good
just
slightly
above
average
no
doubt
due
to
the
fact
it
is
off
the
tap
this
is
worse
than
i
remember
it
being
on
bottles
though
the
bottle
did
get
a
lower
score
and
wouldnt
have
gone
for
it
if
there
were
better
choices
in
the
crappy
airport
bar
i
was
in
overall
a
great
tailgate
beer
and
certainly
better
than
the
xxlight
usually
available
shiner
amber
lager
would
be
a
better
name
for
this
beer
but
then
they
wouldnt
be
able
to
put
the
billy
goat
on
the
label
d
not
a
good
bock
it
is
drinkable
but
why
do
it
this
is
something
to
appeal
to
the
bmc
crowd
in
texas
and
very
popular
in
its
home
state
i
think
the
people
at
spoetzl
dumbed
this
down
intentionally
they
can
make
some
good
beers

pours
a
dark

with
a
small
off

faintly
of
grain
taste
is
rather
sweet
with
a
bit
of
toasty
grain
flavor
slight
presence
of
hops
to
balance
average

with

high

levels
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
appeals
to
the
masses
but
with
a
bit
more
flavor
than
an
average
bmc
still
seems
to
share
that
same
sickly
sweet
flavor
that
many
of
the
macro
lagers
have
i
dont
know
if
this
is
from
adjuncts
or
something
else
d
i
bought
it
because
it
was
on
sale
for
2
less
than
sam
adams
i
wish
i
had
bought
the
sam
enough
said
d
this
beer
has
a
soft
clean
flavor
but
the
favor
it
does
have
is
not
that
good
i
had
a
tough
time
finishing
this
beer
as
it
was
just
not
tasty
and
i
didnt
care
for
the
nougat
flavor
it
did
have
d
this
is
a
real
nice
beer
especially
when
you
can
get
it
on
tap
goes
good
with
all
types
of
bbq
nice
and
refreshing
with
good
flavor
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
dfw
airport
between
flights
id
had
it
previously
from
bottles
about
3
years
ago
and
wasnt
really
impressed
now
after
trying
it
again
im
still
not
altogether
impressed
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
and
the
aroma
wasnt
as
maltyrich
as
the
bocks
i
prefer
the
smell
definitely
had
a
malt
component
no
hops
in
the
smell
but
it
wasnt
sweet
and
thick
in
the
scent
the
flavor
was
the
same
kind
of
a
bland
beer
with
a
hint
of
the
bock
style
to
it
i
suspect
that
the
brewery
wanted
to
make
a
beer
that
was
mostly
still
macro
in
character
with
just
a
hint
of
the
category
of
beer
they
were
emulating
its
possible
that
this
beer
would
then
sell
well
as
it
wouldnt
be
too
offensive
to
the
vast
majority
of
typical
beer
consumers
its
just
a
guess
on
my
part
but
in
any
case
i
feel
this
is
the
definition
of
a
gateway
beer
not
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
occupied
with
it
d
is
a
drinkable
brew
because
of
the
low
abv
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
not
a
lot
of
smell
but
the
smell
is
malty
taste
is
malty
with
a
vague
sweetness
to
it
flavor
doesnt
really
go
anywhere
but
the
flavor
that
is
there
is
pleasant
malty
aftertaste
dissipates
quickly
mouthfeel
smooth
not
very
complex
but
has
a
pleasant
taste
and
very
drinkable
this
is
my
getting
my
connection
in
texas
beer
whenever
i
am
in
george
bushhouston
or
dallas
fort
worth
i
always
make
a
point
to
find
some
brisket
and
suck
down
a
few
of
these
before
i
get
on
my
next
flight
the
beer
isnt
complex
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
will
always
taste
like
texas
to
me
mfd
smooth
and
very
easy
to
polish
off
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
with
an
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
it
has
a
sweet
malt
taste
with
very
little
hops
the
feel
is
medium
and
wet
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
and
a
fine
low
cost
alternative
i
had
never
had
one
and
wound
up
at
dover
downs
and
it
was
the
only
nonmacro
available
i
was
so
impressed
i
bought
some
when
i
got
home
good
mouthfeel
and
a
drinkablity
that
goes
well
with
bbq
or
mexican
not
my
favorite
beer
but
i
still
find
it
appealing
this
beer
is
pretty
average
id
pick
it
over
an
american
macro
but
only
if
there
was
nothing
better
d
its
certainly
drinkable
and
a
better
candidate
to
reach
for
over
most
any
macro
on
the
other
hand
if
boston
lager
is
on
tap
id
take
that
over
this
i
like
dark
lagers
and
this
one
is
pretty
good
good
color
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
good
carbonation
nice
aroma
and
that
malty
taste
that
i
love
not
a
true
bock
in
the
german
style
but
a
very
drinkable
american
one
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
on
hand
d
just
meh
ill
finish
it
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
drinkability
overall
this
is
where
shiner
bock
shines
i
was
raised
on
this
beer
and
even
though
i
am
from
texas
and
a
little
biased
spoetzls
flagship
beer
is
an
affordable
bock
to
have
around
the
house
it
is
very
inviting
perfect
for
a
pickmeup
in
the
spring
i
have
had
better
bocks
and
beers
before
but
when
i
need
a
comfort
drink
to
make
me
think
of
home
easter
pot
lucks
and
bluebonnets
i
return
to
the
yellow
ram
upon
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
there
is
a
slight
hoppy
taste
with
a
light
feel
in
the
mouth
the
taste
blends
in
good
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
as
you
drink
it
a
great
beer
for
drinking
straight
from
the
bottle
has
a
nice
even
pour
into
a
glass
though
definatly
a
great
beer
for
going
to
resturaunts
with
little
selection
and
great
for
sitting
at
home
and
just
enjoying
beer
overall
a
decently
complex
macro
offering
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
bit
more
robust
however
solid
effort
from
the
folks
in
shiner
texas
poured
dark
reddishbrown
and
maintained
its
head
very
drinkable
with
the
correct
amount
of
carbonation
very
smooth
and
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
kind
of
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
for
a
true
bock
but
i
guess
this
is
a
texas
bock
not
a
german
bock
d
i
have
no
real
problem
with
the
beer
but
id
really
like
more
out
of
it
this
is
kind
of
a
macrobock
so
its
widely
appealing
with
nothing
that
would
offend
anyone
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
search
it
out
would
choose
it
over
most
lite
macros
though
this
one
screws
up
the
girlfirend
meter
she
and
i
both
like
it
this
beer
is
not
a
world
class
bock
or
probably
not
even
a
bock
it
is
a
cheap
easy
to
find
beer
with
flavor
great
beer
for
golf
appearance
is
dark
amber
with
a
crisp
head
that
hangs
just
for
a
bit
aroma
is
lightly
malted
and
the
same
would
go
for
the
taste
along
with
a
mild
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
carbonation
to
help
it
go
down
got
this
one
on
sale
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
id
reach
for
this
one
again
under
a
hot
texas
sun
i
can
respect
this
brews
ability
to
quench
a
fierce
thirst
it
is
refreshing
light
and
easy
to
drink
however
lacking
the
richness
of
my
favorite
bocks
disappointing
head
disappears
soon
after
pouring
as
a
bock
lover
this
is
not
a
buy
for
me
unless
it
is
on
special
and
i
know
i
will
be
having
guests
who
may
appreciate
the
variety
quite
frankly
i
am
continuously
finding
it
to
be
a
boring
beer
failing
to
boast
any
truly
impressive
feature
save
for
the
hype
dark
carmel
color
with
a
faint
aroma
of
shower
water
the
head
died
almost
immediately
after
pouring
the
taste
is
tart
at
the
front
and
then
fades
nicely
to
a
sweet
charcoal
it
is
a
bit
lively
on
the
tongue
but
the
carbonation
washes
away
into
a
more
watery
refreshment
a
touch
of
what
i
have
always
liked
to
describe
as
cardboard
flavor
here
and
a
hint
of
what
might
suggest
this
came
from
a
can
rather
than
a
tap
at
dfw
airport
but
with
some
caramel
highlights
its
really
not
so
bad
a
refreshing
drink
that
will
go
down
pretty
easy
but
a
little
disappointing
given
its
popularity
in
the
texas
area
t
its
a
little
too
light
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
too
watery
the
taste
has
some
of
the
malt
and
caramel
character
that
you
would
expect
however
that
said
like
the
aroma
it
wasnt
so
powerful
its
a
good
solid
beer
not
great
but
def
a
cut
above
avg
it
had
been
perhaps
10
years
since
i
last
had
this
beer
which
was
a
few
years
before
i
knew
anything
about
beer
and
while
it
was
once
a
tradeup
for
me
it
is
no
more
this
bock
is
more
like
a
mainstream
lager
than
any
other
bock
ive
tasted
aroma
of
this
beer
was
of
corn
rather
than
malt
and
its
appearance
was
a
pleasing
clear
redbrown
with
a
minimal
amount
of
head
flavor
was
pretty
lackluster
not
as
corny
as
the
aroma
but
still
not
very
malty
for
a
bock
mouthfeel
was
unremarkable
but
i
have
a
hard
time
imagining
drinking
more
than
23
of
these
not
because
they
were
flavored
extremely
strongly
or
because
it
is
high
in
alcohol
but
just
because
drinking
it
kind
of
made
me
want
something
else
the
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
jazzy
here
but
its
good
for
around
the
backyard
barbecue
when
youre
not
as
concerned
with
complexity
i
tried
this
at
a
restaurant
in
arizona
just
out
of
curiosity
the
smell
was
not
to
strong
the
taste
was
smooth
and
had
no
bitterness
to
it
which
was
surprising
considering
the
color
you
could
probably
drink
this
beer
all
day
when
working
in
the
yard
or
something
if
you
like
a
dark
beer
that
isnt
too
strong
for
all
its
deficiencies
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
and
is
the
most
widely
available
nonswill
in
texas
when
i
visit
the
inlaws
in
east
tx
this
is
what
i
retreat
to
it
reminds
me
of
a
southern
leinies
and
strikes
me
as
something
id
have
drunk
as
a
steppingstone
brew
if
id
grown
up
in
lets
say
ft
worth
or
on
second
thought
lets
not
say
that
notes
this
beer
has
an
almost
cultlike
following
here
in
texas
though
im
not
really
sure
why
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
certainly
not
a
great
one
either
if
youre
ever
in
texas
id
recommend
trying
it
just
so
you
can
see
what
all
the
hypes
about
i
guess
my
biggest
beef
with
it
is
the
label
its
not
a
bock
beer
by
any
standard
id
call
it
a
vienna
lager
pours
a
crisp
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
quickly
diminished
to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
caramel
malts
but
not
much
else
overall
rather
weak
the
beer
was
very
malts
but
overall
rather
on
the
blandoff
side
the
beer
is
very
light
and
crisp
but
somewhat
overly
carbonated
i
find
it
somewhat
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
advertised
as
microbrew
it
really
has
a
big
brewery
feel
and
would
likely
only
be
truly
enjoyed
by
fans
of
that
beer
give
me
a
spaten
bock
over
this
stuff
any
day
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
and
then
move
on
to
something
else
i
liked
the
light
taste
of
this
beer
without
it
tasting
like
your
avareage
lager
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
while
not
being
too
sweet
another
beer
that
i
wish
that
i
could
get
here
in
buffalo
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
to
offer
friends
that
arent
adventurous
when
it
comes
to
trying
new
beers
was
this
a
good
beer
that
was
dumbed
down
i
hope
so
actually
hope
not
on
special
at
a
texmex
place
in
austin
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
some
amber
overtones
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
smell
but
whats
there
is
the
smell
of
dark
malts
maybe
some
wheat
the
flavor
is
slight
nowhere
near
as
pronounced
as
that
of
bocks
in
germany
ive
described
this
to
friends
as
an
american
macro
lager
with
food
coloring
in
it
theres
maybe
a
little
more
bitterness
and
malt
flavor
than
budweiser
but
its
not
incredibly
complex
or
anything
still
it
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
good
drinkability
it
lacks
the
offensive
aftertaste
of
the
shiner
hefeweizen
this
would
be
an
inexpensive
bock
i
would
keep
in
my
fridge
for
spring
consumption
again
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
tryed
in
the
good
ole
united
states
and
living
in
texas
at
the
time
its
basically
everywhere
and
when
you
find
a
good
establishment
with
good
turnover
it
really
can
be
good
this
beautiful
brown
brew
with
its
sweet
smell
and
delicious
taste
that
is
slighty
bitter
but
sweet
with
a
brilliant
after
taste
that
rivals
other
american
beers
of
the
same
style
i
had
no
problem
downing
4
or
5
shiners
over
the
course
of
2
hours
at
the
bar
last
saturday
its
a
good
beer
to
drink
with
friends
while
thowing
darts
shooting
pool
or
what
have
you
almost
everyone
ive
introduced
it
to
has
enjoyed
it
surprised
to
find
out
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
in
a
bottle
than
on
tap
had
trouble
finishing
the
one
i
had
with
dinner
appearence
was
dark
amber
with
one
finger
of
head
which
disappeared
to
quickly
almost
no
smell
and
flavor
was
not
as
good
as
the
bottle
i
had
the
prior
evening
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
bock
appears
somewhat
lighter
than
others
ive
tried
but
still
has
a
decent
mediumbrown
hue
the
head
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
however
the
stout
ive
been
drinking
lately
might
have
skewed
my
view
the
aroma
is
probably
the
beers
best
feature
warm
and
fruity
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
flavor
wise
the
beer
comes
up
a
little
short
it
has
many
of
the
subtle
fruity
characteristics
of
a
bock
but
it
seems
a
little
on
the
thin
side
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
at
the
very
reasonable
price
im
sure
ill
buy
it
again
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
wateriness
and
in
my
opinion
there
is
just
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
not
tough
beer
to
drink
but
i
think
that
there
have
to
be
much
better
ones
out
there
that
do
a
better
job
of
summing
up
the
style
well
see
how
the
rest
of
the
sixer
fares
drinkability
is
average
im
not
much
on
the
style
or
the
taste
if
you
like
a
bock
this
is
probably
an
ok
choice
from
safeway
in
eureka
ca
on
sale
at
6
29
a
sixpack
this
poured
an
amber
to
brown
color
with
light
tan
head
and
almost
no
lacing
nose
was
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
average
flavor
very
bland
and
finish
nondescript
while
this
may
be
the
best
thing
to
come
out
of
texas
it
is
not
very
impressive
this
one
is
dead
average
for
its
type
overall
impression
a
lightly
malty
slightly
grainy
well
balanced
beer
no
off
flavors
and
seems
like
a
fresh
sample
not
sure
this
is
truly
a
bock
other
than
the
fact
that
its
probably
a
lager
yeast
strain
tastes
like
a
macro
lager
with
some
carmel
flavoring
still
its
highly
sessionable
and
pretty
good
once
the
dms
clears
out
worth
a
try
i
suppose
i
cant
imagine
anybody
not
liking
this
beer
as
it
has
more
to
offer
than
any
bmc
product
would
that
being
said
this
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
for
this
time
of
the
year
when
the
heavier
stouts
and
winter
brews
start
to
give
way
to
hefes
and
belgian
ales
this
is
a
good
transitional
beer
for
that
time
period
or
something
to
enjoy
for
a
relaxed
night
out
but
not
suited
for
much
else
this
is
the
beer
that
i
first
experienced
after
becoming
of
legal
age
before
that
it
was
always
my
dads
bud
light
therefore
this
review
may
be
a
little
biased

1
inch

leaving

the
aroma
appears
to
be

of
malt
maybe
a
little
grain
and
a
slight
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
light
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
with
a
light
caramle
aftertaste
not
a
heavy
beer
but
still
no
shortness
of
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
and
a
smooth
finish
this
is
easily
a
beer
to
session
whether
sitting

home
or
in

on
the

is
a
great
beer

mouthfeel

with

open

drinkability
is
higher
due
to
the
ease
of
drinking
this
beer
i
was
really
let
down
by
this
beer
it
is
nowhere
as
good
as
penn
st
nick
bock
i
know
that
is
a
really
good
beer
to
live
up
to
but
it
really
fell
short
it
was
better
than
michelob
bock
though
d
i
had
a
hard
time
drinking
this
if
you
can
make
it
through
the
initial
sweet
rush
then
you
get
a
glance
at
some
decent
flavor
not
my
thing
but
recommend
for
macro
drinkers
who
fear
darker
beer
cheers
this
beer
was
totally
nonimpressive
poured
very
thin
to
a
pale
amber
color
with
little
head
or
lacing
i
could
not
detect
any
aroma
and
the
taste
whatever
was
there
was
not
evident
due
to
the
watery
texture
and
stale
finish
id
heard
this
was
a
good
beer
obviously
i
was
listening
to
the
wrong
people
ill
drink
it
again
i
live
in
texas
and
lets
face
it
its
just
an
average
beer
it
wont
kill
you
im
not
one
to
knock
on
cans
i
really
like
warbird
and
dales
pale
ale
but
out
of
the
can
shiner
bock
is
raunchy
better
in
the
bottle
or
on
tap
id
like
to
chalk
this
up
to
having
had
a
really
old
can
overall
a
good
drinking
beer
especially
if
you
enjoy
moderately
malty
brew
ordered
on
tap
looked
ok
a
deep
mahogony
in
the
club
not
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
smell
mouthfeel
was
carbonated
like
soda
to
me
and
the
bitter
tastes
and
sweet
tastes
were
not
blended
adjunct
taste
i
love
bocks
and
dubblebocks
great
quaffing
beers
for
me
and
remind
me
of
my
tour
in
germany
this
one
i
just
couldnt
finish
this
brewerys
offering
just
arent
to
my
taste
though
it
seems
to
be
a
solid
seller
this
beer
is
worshiped
by
many
in
tx
i
have
to
say
its
not
bad
when
compared
to
coors
light
bud
light
etc
plenty
of
color
and
flavor
compared
to
those
usual
macro
suspects
as
an
aspiring
craftish
brew
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
i
did
enjoy
this
one
though
thanks
to
cburian
for
importing
this
one
so
i
could
sample
and
review
it
came
without
much
of
a
head
but
the
color
was
nice
dark
brown
like
rich
chocolate
milk
and
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
i
was
surprised
that
there
wasnt
much
smell
to
speak
of
though
the
malt
did
come
through
in
the
nose
a
bit
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
was
surprisingly
rich
lightly
roasted
malt
a
bit
less
roast
flavor
than
i
expected
given
the
color
and
a
delicate
balance
of
hops
to
refresh
i
enjoyed
it
i
was
driving
and
thats
all
i
could
do
but
others
in
our
party
had
second
glasses
its
easily
a
beer
you
could
enjoy
all
night
poured
burnt
orange
in
color
with
a
minimal
laced
head
what
was
there
was
gone
very
quickly
smells
of
malt
and
grapes
tatses
pretty
much
like
nothing
at
first
no
sweetness
no
malt
then
a
slight
bitterness
tries
to
reach
out
to
grab
your
tongue
but
i
think
it
moved
done
my
throat
too
fast
leaving
something
trying
to
come
but
not
quite
reaching
its
goal
very
fizzy
and
overly
carbonated
very
drinkable
as
its
almost
like
drinking
down
a
bottle
of
water
drinkablebut
boringreminds
me
of
a
macro
got
a
keg
for
12
pricenow
i
know
why
overall
drinkability
was
good
this
beer
is
easily
drinkable
even
though
there
is
no
particular
outstanding
component
drinkability
if
wed
stayed
i
would
have
been
on
to
something
else
i
couldnt
drink
a
lot
of
this
insession
red
autumn
color
decent
head
with
nice
lacing
smell
came
off
fruity
but
i
liked
that
i
cant
explain
the
taster
over
than
there
was
a
hint
of
citrus
and
was
a
good
well
rounded
beer
medium
carbonation
great
for
everyday
drinking
my
kind
of
beer
can
drink
easily
if
poured
in
a
glass
for
a
while
but
it
gets
boring
when
i
visited
my
daughter
and
soninlaw
in
houston
recently
i
wanted
to
try
one
of
the
local
brews
this
is
what
they
told
me
to
order
it
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
no
head
to
it
it
had
a
nondescript
malty
aroma
and
a
nondescript
vaguely
sweet
taste
actually
ok
for
mouthfeel
and
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
it
went
down
easily
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
hope
other
offerings
from
the
brewery
are
better
this
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
smell
is
a
bit
malty
with
a
light
hop
scent
the
taste
is
mild
and
malty
with
a
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
carbonated
the
drinkablity
of
this
one
is
highease
to
kick
back
with
a
few
pours
a
light
brown
topped
by
an
offwhite
head
aroma
has
some
hints
of
caramel
and
hops
fairly
clean
with
a
bit
of
a
mineral
note
as
well
flavor
has
some
light
malt
notes
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
rather
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
supports
the
flavor
well
mouthfeel
actually
greatly
enhances
the
flavor
i
must
actually
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
expected
to
dont
overlook
this
beer
just
because
its
well
known
or
its
not
a
bock
for
a
good
solid
everyday
performer
id
love
to
have
this
one
available
around
the
house
not
on
the
short
list
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
no
particular
strong
flavors
just
basic
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
bitter
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
but
doesnt
stand
up
very
well
in
the
mouth
a
bit
of
a
gritty
cloying
aftertaste
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
but
just
doesnt
inspire
i
could
see
it
again
on
occasion
but
if
i
didnt
my
life
would
still
be
worth
living
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
minimal
head
smells
of
bread
and
grains
with
hops
as
a
background
the
taste
is
heavy
of
bread
and
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
well
balanced
with
the
carbonation
but
lacks
in
complexity
if
you
enjoy
the
taste
of
one
you
could
have
more
a
more
tasty
beer
would
be
more
drinkable
d
it
is
drinkable
id
rather
drink
this
than
a
typical
macro
but
it
is
a
weak
example
of
the
style
i
am
not
going
to
have
this
again
well
honestly
this
is
the
first
bock
i
have
ever
had
but
i
am
comparing
it
to
what
i
imagine
a
half
doppelbock
half
water
mixture
would
taste
it
begs
the
question
why
bock
when
you
can
doppel
dnot
my
favorite
beer
but
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
offering
i
have
had
lately
but
at
the
airport
in
dallas
i
had
to
try
a
local
texas
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
brown
color
light
frothy
tanish
white
head
disapated
rather
quickly
no
lacing
of
the
glass
smells
light
and
malty
some
type
of
yeasty
dough
smell
mild
hints
of
caramel
brown
sugary
light
toasted
corn
nut
smellmaybe
a
hint
of
baked
beans
rather
smooth
but
also
quite
watery
not
alot
of
body
in
this
beer
it
is
drinkable
and
rather
light
for
a
darker
beer
it
had
a
nice
mild
caramel
malt
flavor
that
is
followed
by
a
light
hop
finish
not
a
lot
of
hops
present
in
this
brew
it
is
alright
but
i
think
i
would
pass
on
it
next
time
fat
tire
was
on
tap
too
so
i
went
with
that
next
it
makes
for
a
tough
competion
this
should
be
the
national
beer
of
texas
living
here
in
texas
this
is
one
of
my
main
fridge
beers
this
is
a
beer
that
wont
gag
you
if
it
gets
warm
has
a
nice
head
with
moderate
lacing
cost
a
little
more
than
the
macro
brews
but
its
worth
it
so
when
yall
come
to
visit
try
a
shiner
bock
you
wont
be
sorry
oh
and
ask
about
the
rams
head
on
the
bottle
ok
but
not
great
this
is
a
beer
i
always
try
to
drink
at
least
a
couple
of
when
visiting
the
lone
star
state
i
havent
gotten
down
there
in
a
while
so
i
had
one
in
lieu
of
major
macros
at
a
local
italian
place
a
the
appearance
seemed
promising
with
nice
med
brown
color
and
light
carbonation
with
a
thin
head
s
not
much
to
speak
of
really
a
little
carmelized
malt
with
a
tiny
bit
of
smokiness
maybe
t
mild
and
a
little
disappointing
with
some
malt
body
and
little
hop
balance
carmel
and
a
slight
undertone
of
hickory
smoke
m
pretty
thin
for
a
beer
that
claims
to
be
a
bock
this
is
pretty
drinkable
stuff
if
as
in
my
case
you
find
yourself
somewhere
that
only
offers
bmc
products
im
not
sure
why
but
i
have
in
the
past
drunk
3
or
even
sometimes
fewer
shiner
bocks
and
woken
up
with
a
hangover
there
is
some
additive
or
ingredient
contained
therein
that
does
not
agree
with
my
system
so
session
this
stuff
with
a
degree
of
caution
d
nothing
outstanding
about
it
but
it
is
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
its
a
clear
deep
copper
hue
with
very
active
carbonation
and
a
2
khaki
head
that
leaves
light
lacing
light
caramel
and
molasses
malts
in
the
aroma
with
some
macroadjunct
qualities
the
flavor
is
the
same
with
very
light
greenspicy
hops
on
top
of
a
light
body
that
has
lively
carbonation
and
leaves
a
short
finish
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
flavorful
tastes
like
a
macro
version
of
a
bock
d
as
far
as
bocks
go
its
not
my
favorite
but
it
goes
down
well
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
bock
but
i
have
to
admit
i
could
knock
quite
a
few
of
these
back
with
great
ease
i
found
absolutely
nothing
offensive
whatsoever
yeah
its
thin
and
not
all
that
exciting
but
its
still
a
decent
dark
lager
of
sorts
shiner
bock
was
deep
copper
in
color
with
a
34
inch
head
that
disappeared
almost
immediately
sweet
malt
aroma
and
flavor
light
to
medium
bodied
seems
light
for
the
slyle
its
not
something
that
i
would
buy
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
a
solid
beer
none
the
less
one
of
the
closest
brewerys
near
my
home
and
one
i
have
visited
often
recommended
tiny
hint
of
malts
present
barely
any
hop
qualities
recommendable
88
very
sippable
although
the
flavors
could
be
more
pronounced
they
balance
nicely
with
the
carbonation
to
make
for
an
enjoyable
brew
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
are
diehard
fans
of
this
beer
drinkability
is
good
i
drank
a
sixer
of
this
at
dinner
i
like
it
but
i
dont
think
its
a
good
example
of
the
bock
style
and
i
like
supporting
the
underdog
its
an
order
of
magnitude
better
than
anything
bmc
produces
and
ab
has
created
a
product
line
specifically
to
steal
this
guys
market
share
so
i
buy
when
i
see
it
i
remember
thinking
this
was
the
bomb
in
college
before
my
palate
found
itself
and
tasted
good
beer
from
places
like
sierra
and
stone
it
is
a
crappy
bock
why
do
they
call
it
that
when
it
really
isnt
but
is
an
alright
substitute
for
macros
if
there
is
nothing
else
around
first
off
i
chose
this
beer
from
the
draft
lineup
at
silver
jack
mining
restaurant
in
montroseco
due
to
the
restaurants
poor
selection
of
draft
beer
domestic
dominated
with
the
usual
new
belgium
bs
i
ordered
a
shiner
bock
because
it
was
the
only
beer
available
that
i
hadnt
tried
it
arrived
at
my
table
poured
to
the
top
of
the
glass
with
no
head
at
all
not
a
good
start
the
first
sip
was
a
mixture
of
under
carbonated
beer
dirty
draft
lines
that
was
my
entire
experienced
as
i
kindly
asked
our
waiter
for
a
glass
of
water
to
clean
my
pallet
not
recommended
this
is
not
a
great
beer
by
an
stretch
in
fact
i
would
place
it
only
slightly
above
a
budweiser
or
something
the
smell
not
great
and
the
taste
is
only
slightly
more
complex
than
any
standard
issue
24
pack
at
the
gas
station
i
wouldnt
recomend
this
beer
and
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
its
a
little
hoppy
but
mainly
the
taste
is
bland
boriing
and
not
at
all
unique
overall
its
one
of
those
you
just
have
old
memories
of
certainly
one
that
we
all
drank
some
in
the
past
bad
example
of
a
bock
but
i
say
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
great
at
bbqs
shiner
bock
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
really
cant
smell
much
of
anything
the
flavor
is
less
than
exciting
as
well
a
little
malt
a
little
nut
like
flavor
maybe
worth
a
try
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
though
the
pour
is
a
dark
copperred
with
a
white
head
that
makes
a
brief
appearance
the
nose
has
caramel
malts
lager
yeast
and
earthlyfruity
hops
those
flavors
combine
with
roasted
malts
and
nuts
in
its
bland
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
but
it
bit
too
sticky
feh
this
is
only
on
par
with
amber
bock
theres
no
reason
to
seek
it
out
although
it
would
be
ok
in
a
pinch
if
bmc
were
the
only
alternatives
cheers
drinkability
this
beer
makes
me
frown
and
shake
my
head
its
not
awful
just
really
off
in
a
lot
of
ways
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
a
fresher
bottle
or
a
glass
on
tap
im
not
sure
how
they
get
away
with
calling
this
a
bock
as
the
flavor
here
is
so
bland
it
feels
too
light
for
a
bock
as
well
maybe
it
could
work
as
a
dark
lager
might
be
best
have
it
with
food
so
that
you
dont
notice
the
complete
lack
of
flavor
overall
its
a
fairly
average
beer
i
lot
of
people
hate
on
this
beer
and
as
a
bock
it
is
a
fraud
however
as
a
beer
it
sometimes
fills
the
void
out
of
the
bottle
or
on
tap
the
beer
is
pretty
much
the
same
nice
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
lace
but
has
some
staying
power
this
smells
of
mostly
clean
lager
yeast
with
a
hinting
of
malts
and
hops
but
nothing
too
much
the
flavor
is
crisp
amber
lager
beer
with
maybe
a
bend
to
the
sweeter
ock
style
this
beer
could
just
use
more
to
push
it
into
the
next
stepup
overall
an
easy
drinker
but
it
holds
back
to
gain
mass
appeal
beer
is
buisnesss
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
not
really
worth
the
6
996pack
price
tag
imo
give
me
some
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
for
1
more
shiner
gets
kicked
alot
here
on
the
advocate
and
i
guess
i
understand
that
compared
to
the
great
micros
and
european
imports
its
just
well
it
is
what
it
is
but
theres
something
about
their
bock
and
their
kolsch
which
is
not
reviewed
here
they
are
just
plain
drinkable
and
the
more
you
drink
them
the
more
you
appreciate
them
day
in
and
day
out
shiner
is
a
good
choice
20
years
drinking
this
beer
appearance
is
amber
with
little
to
no
head
out
of
the
bottle
from
tap
the
head
is
a
bit
better
and
longer
retention
very
drinkable
not
as
heavy
as
you
would
think
a
bockstyle
beer
which
makes
it
a
good
session
beer
tried
this
from
a
friend
who
procured
a
bottle
for
me
poured
into
a
pint
glass
no
real
head
to
speak
of
with
a
smell
comparable
to
that
of
bud
or
another
massproduced
brew
taste
was
a
little
better
with
some
sweet
malt
shining
through
though
nothiung
striking
mouthfeel
was
very
light
as
was
tastewhich
was
unexpected
due
to
darkened
color
allright
beer
for
cookouts
or
when
its
hot
out
im
guessing
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
this
may
work
itself
into
my
beer
rotation
is
this
a
good
bock
i
seriously
doubt
that
it
is
a
good
bock
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
in
my
book
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
was
one
of
my
standards
while
i
was
living
in
texas
it
was
carried
just
about
everywhere
and
tasted
great
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
tasted
a
bit
like
new
castle
dont
yell
at
me
but
they
both
have
a
bit
of
a
nutty
taste
easy
to
drink
perfect
carbonation
if
you
havent
tried
it
i
would
defiantly
recommend
picking
some
up
no
doubt
it
wont
be
the
best
thing
you
ever
had
but
like
i
said
its
a
good
regular
and
its
not
too
expensive
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
without
much
of
a
head
scents
of
toasted
caramel
and
fruit
on
the
nose
i
had
this
beer
several
years
ago
and
recall
enjoying
it
at
the
time
however
i
found
this
to
be
on
the
thin
side
although
it
was
smooth
this
could
be
due
to
the
watered
down
effect
the
beer
provided
not
offensive
but
not
enough
to
make
you
want
another
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
the
bottle
the
amber
color
is
ok
not
much
of
a
scent
and
a
bittersweet
flavor
that
is
basically
a
strong
coors
a
really
strong
coors
drinkable
but
nuthin
special
had
this
on
tap
at
a
nicks
sports
pub
they
have
a
large
selection
and
im
trying
to
get
through
everything
first
off
i
love
bocks
i
gave
this
a
try
i
was
not
happy
it
felt
watery
and
tasted
kind
of
flat
which
i
guess
is
how
it
is
supposed
to
taste
since
i
had
it
on
tap
i
dont
think
id
get
this
ever
again
it
was
slightly
sweet
but
overall
very
boring
also
the
smell
was
weird
i
dont
know
else
how
to
describe
it
but
it
wasnt
pleasant
shiner
bock
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
head
that
dissipates
really
quickly
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
didnt
notice
anything
exceptional
in
the
smell
not
a
particularly
memorable
taste
but
not
unpleasant
either
overall
malt
background
a
little
bitterness
a
real
slight
astringent
taste
other
than
lack
of
head
the
only
other
thing
that
disappoints
is
the
mouthfeel
really
thin
drinkability
is
good
i
had
three
of
them
and
they
went
down
fine
just
enough
taste
to
hold
your
interest
for
a
session
if
i
had
a
choice
between
yeungling
sam
adams
boston
lager
or
shiner
bock
the
shiner
bock
would
lose
as
an
alternative
to
bmc
no
problem
notes
thanks
to
my
friend
for
bringing
the
bottle
back
from
austin
tx
great
to
finally
get
the
chance
to
give
it
a
try
could
see
myself
bringing
pitchers
and
pitchers
of
this
in
a
bar
as
tumbleweed
rolls
by
on
a
dusty
texas
street
edit
i
had
this
beer
my
friend
bought
some
and
owes
me
so
i
had
one
holy
crap
i
can
not
taste
anything
but
malts
where
are
the
hops
adjunts
come
out
a
little
too
oelergud
had
a
chance
to
sample
a
bottle
on
a
recent
trip
south
of
the
border
one
of
the
beer
options
available
at
the
famous
tootsies
in
nashville
clear
copper
brown
color
small
top
of
off
white
foam
that
doesnt
last
smell
is
some
caramel
with
a
bit
of
molasses
malty
nose
but
really
have
to
look
for
it
taste
is
a
caramel
malt
with
a
toffee
or
molasses
pretty
thin
taste
hint
of
flavor
but
kind
of
lacking
the
more
you
drink
the
more
bland
it
seems
leaves
you
wanting
more
flavor
and
taste
mouthfeel
is
diluted
and
watered
down
pretty
thin
for
a
bock
a
little
darker
but
not
much
to
it
a
easy
to
drink
step
up
from
a
macro
this
beer
was
not
like
any
other
bock
ive
tasted
and
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
hope
it
wasnt
the
meal
interfering
with
my
pallette
but
this
brew
really
seemed
like
it
was
in
an
entirely
different
family
altogether
and
not
a
good
one
at
that
american
macro
lagerpilsener
the
color
was
lighter
than
i
expected
a
reddish
amber
and
a
little
pale
the
bitterness
seemed
way
out
of
balance
a
biting
sort
of
front
end
to
the
experience
and
a
rather
watery
thin
mouthfeel
followed
it
definitely
fell
short
of
my
expectations
appears
dark
dark
amber
small
carbs
and
little
head
that
left
nothing
on
top
this
beer
has
no
real
smell
it
had
a
slight
grainy
scent
other
than
that
nothing
to
appetize
it
the
mouth
it
was
average
for
foam
but
seemed
to
have
a
wierd
sour
taste
not
from
hops
it
didnt
seem
like
this
was
turning
bad
either
just
unwelcome
it
seemed
like
a
darker
lager
taste
but
there
really
wasnt
anything
else
to
speak
off
it
was
a
little
bitter
but
hops
were
not
noticeable
and
there
was
a
note
of
must
from
the
water
date
on
the
bottle
was
02
03
06
so
either
its
old
or
its
young
and
it
tastes
no
good
i
wouldnt
reccomend
this
had
on
tap
at
the
fox
and
hound
in
beavercreek
my
main
problem
with
this
one
is
it
was
just
bland
not
bland
as
in
bad
but
bland
as
in
nothing
distinguishing
about
it
draft
when
served
was
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
faint
veil
of
foam
aroma
was
clean
tastewise
sorry
just
bland
low
malt
low
hops
nothing
to
distinguish
same
at
the
start
as
at
the
finish
an
interesting
experience
id
pick
this
over
several
other
macros
but
there
are
too
many
better
brews
to
make
it
a
regular
is
it
possible
for
a
beer
to
be
the
epitome
of
a
style
but
so
boring
that
its
just
deadon
average
thats
shiner
bock
i
drink
these
every
so
often
but
never
buy
a
sixpack
and
will
generally
pick
another
beer
over
it
might
be
a
bridge
for
a
macrolover
but
thats
about
it
shiner
bock
ive
just
found
a
replacement
for
yuengling
lager
this
is
some
good
stuff
to
slurp
down
one
after
the
other
after
a
long
day
of
work
or
while
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
feel
this
is
an
average
beer
worth
picking
up
from
the
grocery
store
every
once
in
a
while
to
make
an
evening
out
of
it
all
of
that
said
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
knock
back
pretty
quickly
not
good
enough
to
savor
not
bad
enough
that
its
undrinkable
d
drinkable
the
taste
is
not
too
bad
not
sure
if
i
will
buy
again
but
i
might
use
it
in
my
chili
recipe
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
either
its
best
quality
is
that
it
looks
like
it
will
taste
good
better
for
tailgating
etc
than
when
you
want
a
tasty
beer
to
stand
on
its
own
merits
after
my
experiment
today
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
the
shiner
over
the
ziegenbock
at
hooters
if
i
want
a
real
beer
i
am
going
elsewhere
bottles
are
good
but
properly
served
pints
are
awesome
catch
one
at
the
dallas
airport
and
you
wont
be
sorry
compared
to
typical
microbrews
its
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
you
can
definitely
tell
it
is
not
all
barleywheat
but
for
what
it
is
shiner
bock
is
mighty
good
definitely
head
and
shoulders
above
most
of
the
beers
you
can
find
local
bars
i
need
to
get
a
german
bock
cause
i
cant
believe
this
is
what
a
bock
should
be
a
clear
cola
brown
with
a
big
fuzzy
tan
head
almost
no
malt
smell
followed
by
a
thin
earthy
taste

but
just
not
much
there
very
weak
and
uninspiring
fizzy
beverage
and
very
light
bodied
not
rich
at
all
way
too
hoppy
where
are
the
robust
malts
12
ounce
bottle
shiner
bock
pours
out
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
rocky
head
husky
grain
aroma
sweet
caramel
flavor
with
husk
coming
in
at
the
middle
not
at
all
complex
but
the
malt
flavor
is
pleasant
the
finish
is
bland
a
one
dimensional
beer
but
i
imagine
this
is
drinkable
in
large
quantities
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
this
wont
hold
up
to
the
better
german
bocks
but
for
a
texas
beer
this
isnt
bad
admittedly
its
far
from
true
to
style
but
if
you
look
past
that
the
taste
isnt
bad
being
a
discerning
beer
drinker
myself
i
find
little
in
shiner
bock
that
either
disgusts
me
or
impresses
me
it
has
slightly
more
body
and
appreciably
more
flavor
than
your
major
american
lagers
but
as
a
true
bock
or
a
craft
brew
it
falls
way
short
for
these
reasons
i
give
it
mostly
average
scores
not
to
be
compared
to
what
i
would
consider
an
average
craft
brew
but
rather
to
qualities
that
i
would
say
are
basically
neutral
but
i
do
not
share
the
view
of
some
other
reviewers
who
find
the
beer
to
be
utterly
undrinkable
in
fact
the
only
thing
that
i
find
makes
drinking
this
beer
in
any
large
quantity
difficult
is
boredom
an
aboveaverage
regional
lager
really
its
not
a
bock
by
german
standards
but
it
is
a
bock
by
early
20th
century
american
standards
and
it
kinda
tugs
at
a
texans
heartstrings
in
college
in
austin
in
the
80s
pitchers
of
shiner
were
as
cheap
as
budweiser
and
so
much
better
back
before
we
discovered
microbrews
its
still
good
for
a
nostalgic
taste
trip
when
nothing
better
is
available
the
label
is
nicely
designed
and
provides
interesting
information
about
the
little
brewery
and
its
history
unfortunately
thats
the
best
part
of
this
brew
it
pours
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
bit
below
average
carbonation
and
a
clear
brown
color
with
just
a
tinge
of
red
to
it
head
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
full
of
dms
and
slight
malty
grains
flavor
is
weak
and
barely
more
than
a
swiller
lite
with
a
hint
of
dark
maltchocolate
to
it
poor
representation
of
the
bock
style
and
just
short
of
awful
choked
down
the
rest
of
the
pint
i
bought
a
6
pack
guess
ill
have
to
pass
off
a
couple
bottles
on
those
who
might
want
to
try
one
of
those
dark
beers
even
a
mich
amber
bock
tries
harder
than
this
thats
not
saying
much
pours
a
clear
amber
that
is
more
on
the
brown
side
offwhite
head
of
a
larger
size
with
big
bubbles
and
a
little
carbonation
settles
down
to
lace
the
top
of
the
beer
malty
in
aroma
with
no
trace
of
alcohol
pretty
clean
grainy
in
taste
with
some
toasted
malt
sweetness
and
very
faint
hints
of
caramel
a
rather
dry
and
clean
finish
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
as
for
as
flavour
goes
nothing
great
but
definately
better
than
the
macros
and
the
same
price
as
well
at
least
here
in
texas
a
onetrick
pony
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
if
there
was
more
beer
in
the
bottle
average
across
the
board
but
hey
if
it
goes
for
8
9912
and
impresses
your
friends
that
youre
into
microbrews
and
a
tiny
trace
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin

5344friends
from
tennessee
brought
up
a
case
of
this
with
them
and
soft
carbonation
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
makes
it
so
ridiculously
drinkable
highly
sessionable
and
it
seems
to
get
better
the
more
you
drink
the
beer
is
nothing
special
good
or
bad
at
best
a
faint
malt
smell
that
gives
little
or
no
clue
to
the
beers
make
or
flavor
the
taste
is
suprisingly
full
and
easy
moutfeel
is
watery
but
robust
enough
overall
this
is
my
beer
of
choice
to
tailgate
or
drink
in
quantity
i
can
buy
it
for
little
and
drink
one
after
another
untill
taste
is
not
an
issue
i
buy
it
on
a
regular
basis
and
enjoy
it
hoffmanoct

could
drink
these
rather

i
would
not

it

a
dark
copper
brown
moderate
carbonation
very
malty
in
flavor
mouthfeel
is
what
i
would
consider
somewhat
of
a
smooth
bite
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
but
goes
down
with
no
bitterness
this
is
what
i
would
consider
a
good
this
beer
shares
more
characteristics
with
an
amber
ale
or
an
oktoberfest
still
a
decent
beer
and
it
is
easy
to
see
why
it
is
so
popular
it
lands
somewhere
between
a
macro
and
a
micro
and
is
a
good
crossover
for
many
mushroomcloudaug
13
worthy
alternative
to
the
american
macro
brews
that
rule
the
market
it
has
a
nice
color
caramelly
but
other
than
that
entirely
bland
mouthfeel
is
probably
about
the
thinnest
ive
ever
experienced
in
a
beer
even
light
thick
if
you
intend
to
go
to
austin
at
anytime
you
will
be
forced
to
consume
this
beer
i
appreciated
the
fact
that
there
wasnt
a
budweiser
to
be
found
in
the
club
we
were
in
yet
shiner
bock
was
ubiquitous
i
hadnt
even
asked
for
a
beer
when
it
was
handed
to
me
dont
mind
if
i
do
i
wasnt
expecting
a
real
bock
beer
so
i
wasnt
let
down
yet
it
was
nicely
balanced
with
a
caramel
malt
sweetening
it
slightly
withough
any
cloying
the
smell
was
of
sweet
malt
with
a
grainy
note
and
a
hint
of
some
hops
it
was
gone
in
a
few
gulps
and
i
was
on
to
the
next
one
the
second
one
i
poured
in
a
cincinnati
they
had
sitting
there
next
to
the
water
jug
and
the
clarity
was
fine
but
the
color
was
certainly
off
for
a
bock
as
i
suspected
and
the
head
was
nice
and
sticky
deep
amber
color
with
a
thin
lace
for
a
head
carbonation
sizzles
a
bit
when
the
beer
is
first
poured
the
smell
is
clean
with
a
hint
of
toasted
grains
and
faint
hops
the
taste
is
not
very
big
either
medium
bodied
with
toasted
grain
dominating
the
flavor
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
small
amount
of
hops
come
through
light
toasted
grain
aftertaste
nothing
complex
here
just
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
better
than
your
mainstream
dark
lager
pours
medium
amber
very
slightly
hazy
nose
does
not
consist
of
much
slight
malts
and
alcohol
good
carbonation
not
much
head
slight
lacing
taste
is
a
bit
light
but
not
too
light
does
not
taste
like
a
light
beer
necessarily
malts
come
out
at
the
end
to
round
out
the
feel
and
flavor
i
think
if
the
malts
werent
there
then
it
would
be
a
failure
this
beer
was
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
looking
for
an
option
that
is
not
your
standard
pisswater
but
still
want
to
drink
several
beers
without
them
being
heavy
this
is
a
good
option
i
personally
thought
that
this
was
a
great
overall
beer
it
poured
an
ambercopper
color
had
a
very
rich
full
flavored
smooth
taste
to
it
absolutely
no
excessive
bitterness
at
all
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
to
come
out
of
the
state
of
texas
pours
a
one
finger
plus
head
it
is
a
medium
brown
that
is
very
clear
i
smell
malt
an
earthy
note
and
grassy
malt
and
bitter
is
wellbalanced
the
style
should
be
a
little
heavier
to
the
malt
but
i
like
it
balanced
finishes
clean
and
spicy
fair
very
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
remarkable
poured
a
moderate
copper
color
with
slight
head
that
quickly
fell
to
a
slight
ring
smell
was
almost
totally
absent
but
at
least
not
unpleasant
taste
was
refeshing
but
i
could
not
find
anyting
to
get
excited
about
mouthfeel
is
not
unpleasant
with
a
slight
hint
of
malt
an
easy
drinking
beer
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
14
brown
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
fruity
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
lager
yeast
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
roasted
flavor
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
see
the
overall
average
is
low
but
i
think
its
tastey
and
quite
enjoyable
a
poor
introduction
to
the
bock
style
but
not
nearly
as
awful
as
i
remember
more
of
an
american
dark
lager
but
i
cant
believe
this
beer
has
won
awards
had
my
first
bottle
last
week
after
my
brother
brought
some
home
from
his
texas
trip
and
a
visit
to
the
brewery
this
is
a
light
brown
colored
beer
with
a
pleasant
smell
out
of
the
bottle
taste
i
agree
is
light
for
a
bock
which
i
expect
to
have
some
mouthfeel
chewability
to
it
it
is
probably
the
reason
that
there
is
a
reputation
this
beer
has
as
a
college
brew
its
not
going
to
slow
you
down
any
chewing
on
it
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
and
will
easily
drink
a
few
again
i
understand
that
the
distribution
of
shiner
is
pretty
extensive
so
you
may
find
it
at
a
decent
brew
depot
amber
brown
in
color
with
an
airy
offwhite
head
unpleasant
aroma
of
sour
fruit
malt
and
wet
cardboard
mouthfeel
is
thin
in
addition
shiner
bock
is
thin
in
flavor
for
a
bock
beer
has
this
been
watereddown
for
mass
appeal
taste
was
grainy
it
lacks
the
caramel
and
raisin
flavors
of
a
good
bock
slight
sourness
toward
the
back
finish
is
dry
if
you
want
to
introduced
something
to
newbie
beer
drinkers
and
not
scare
them
away
this
might
be
a
good
starting
point
dungeree
tells
me
that
this
one
is
a
favorite
among
texas
college
students
and
i
believe
him
comes
in
a
standard
12oz
bottle
with
twist
cap
no
obvious
best
by
date
pours
a
orange
amber
color
head
is
almost
nonexistent
does
not
taste
like
other
bocks
i
have
sampled
light
and
hoppy
with
subtle
malt
nothing
to
complain
about
except
head
retention
but
nothing
interesting
either
i
have
had
worse
bocks
sure
but
calling
this
beer
a
bock
is
truly
a
misnomer
its
not
a
great
beer
regardless
but
its
a
shocker
in
this
category
a
waste
of
quality
drinking
space
when
there
were
plenty
of
better
beers
on
offer
i
could
have
had
now
i
am
very
sad
i
long
for
the
days
when
2
12ers
of
shiner
was
the
highlight
in
my
life
decent
score
based
on
mostly
memories
as
i
try
to
erase
this
sad
moment
from
my
brain
i
the
body
is
light
and
thirst
quenching
with
ample
fizz
a
good
beer
for
ballgames
brats
and
budgets
pours
a
nice
tall
medium
thick
head
took
a
good
minute
or
more
to
dissipate
still
a
nice
18
inch
head
remained
showed
a
medium
brown
color
smelled
of
roasted
malts
a
slight
mustiness
and
a
hint
of
a
rustic
feel
tasted
sweet
and
lots
of
roasted
malts
finished
very
bready
wet
at
the
beginning
with
a
little
bit
of
dryness
at
the
end
thin
mouthfeel
allows
for
more
drinkability
its
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
shiner
bock
wont
win
any
awards
but
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
not
only
for
its
flavor
but
for
its
place
in
texas
culture
from
baum
la
vernia
tx
south
of
china
grove
i
picked
up
a
six
of
these
rick
got
six
pack
of
busch
tallboys
decent
drinkability
better
than
ziegenbock
if
this
beer
were
a
mountain
a
tree
covered
jut
of
rock
and
dirt
arcing
skyward
in
defiance
of
gravity
and
the
forces
of
nature
admired
and
adored
by
all
humans
and
animals
then
this
would
only
be
an
average
mountain
maybe
60008000
ft
not
one
of
the
towering
14000
foot
mountains
the
massive
200000
footers
or
the
infamous
29000
foot
everest
it
was
a
decent
beer
plenty
drinkable
and
for
sure
tasty
however
it
was
nothing
to
shout
about
i
figured
i
would
review
this
beer
as
it
has
been
a
staple
of
my
family
and
friends
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
for
me
it
is
the
best
beer
to
swill
from
the
bottle
after
a
hard
days
work
out
in
the
country
it
has
a
refreshingly
evident
malt
flavor
and
even
a
bit
of
hops
comes
through
in
the
finish
while
this
can
still
be
classified
as
massproduced
beer
for
the
price
here
in
texas
you
cant
go
wrong
with
stocking
a
cooler
full
of
shiner
for
an
outing
to
the
country
the
aroma
is
light
malt
and
is
appropriate
for
the
style
nothing
special
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
although
some
hop
shows
up
on
the
swallow
decent
body
good
carbonation
doesnt
have
the
winey
alcohol
flavors
of
most
bocks
my
sample
was
just
starting
to
skunk
ordered
at
prego
in
rice
village
houston
this
was
purely
an
all
around
average
beer
pours
a
medium
copper
color
with
a
medium
sized
fizzy
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
then
slightly
acidic
and
then
malty
again
roasted
grains
hold
the
base
of
this
beer
but
no
other
flavors
really
come
out
slight
carameltoffee
sweetness
with
a
mild
malt
flavoring
in
the
middle
finish
brings
a
very
light
dosage
of
hops
and
a
nice
little
bit
of
acidity
aftertaste
is
weak
though
this
beer
is
average
all
the
way
through
drinkability
certainly
a
step
up
from
the
macros
and
not
unpleasant
but
there
are
much
more
flavorful
and
representative
bocks
out
there
not
bad
not
good
simply
average
doesnt
really
have
the
body
or
maltiness
for
a
true
bock
this
seems
to
be
shiners
most
wellknown
beer
but
not
their
best
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
and
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
either
drinkability
a
nice
little
quaffer
that
i
have
purchased
more
than
once
it
was
hard
to
keep
in
stock
at
the
liquor
store
i
used
to
work
at
transplanted
texans
would
buy
by
the
case
and
t
was
not
uncommon
to
sell
3
or
4
cases
a
week
a
nice
beer
from
texas
definitely
better
than
most
macros
and
different
than
your
typical
macro
i
would
recommend
at
least
trying
the
first
time
i
tried
this
was
the
weekend
of
my
wedding
back
in
july
2003
a
friend
brought
two
cases
up
from
texas
to
st
louis
and
just
raved
about
how
great
this
tastes
maybe
i
had
too
high
expectations
from
that
memory
but
it
was
average
at
best
no
head
rentention
very
cola
colored
no
lacing
rather
flat
tasting
with
just
a
bit
of
hops
to
note
this
is
a
brown
brew
with
some
red
undertones
poured
a
nice
head
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
as
i
enjoy
this
brew
nose
is
of
bread
and
sweet
malts
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
little
hop
impact
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
full
and
lively
overall
drinkability
is
good
i
have
always
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
recommend
it
12
ouncer
sampled
no
indication
of
freshness
to
be
found
poured
a
medium
al
mond
brown
larger
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
at
a
seady
pace
malty
nose
nutty
bready
brew
medium
bodied
got
alot
of
maple
syrup
notes
prickly
carbonation
not
appreciated
sharp
dry
finish
not
the
best
version
of
the
style
never
was
crazy
about
this
stuff
hmmm
i
kinda
expected
more
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
nice
1
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
smells
mostly
of
malt
hops
corn
maybe
the
taste
is
mainly
the
bitterness
of
hops
with
some
malt
it
seems
to
be
kinda
over
carbonated
which
explains
the
low
mouthfeel
rating
too
many
harsh
bubbles
i
would
drink
it
again
but
there
are
many
others
that
i
would
rather
have
i
finally
saw
the
texas
classic
when
i
was
out
shopping
in
western
maryland
and
decided
it
was
worth
giving
it
a
try
even
knowing
that
its
not
highly
regarded
well
its
certainly
not
great
but
it
beats
a
macro
any
day
and
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
i
wont
pour
it
down
the
drain
either
i
paid
six
dollars
for
this
its
not
something
i
will
pay
money
for
again
however
i
would
drink
one
for
free
update
10262004
found
the
abv
its
4
4
thought
this
one
was
pretty
lite
for
a
bock
on
draught
at
pappadeaux
in
the
houston
airport
glad
to
finally
find
this
classic
texan
beer
coppercolored
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
toasted
grain
and
malt
in
the
nose
mediumbodied
with
a
flavor
somewhere
between
a
bock
and
an
adjunct
lager
malt
stale
hops
and
caramel
are
what
the
beer
offers
the
finish
is
smooth
and
does
not
contain
much
flavor
other
than
some
sweet
malt
i
cant
really
call
this
beer
a
disappointment
because
it
met
my
expectations
it
does
not
do
the
bock
style
justice
though
nothing
really
great
here
but
nothing
terrible
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
a
quite
expensive
mediocre
one
ok
here
in
minnesota
this
is
hard
to
come
by
only
like
one
chain
of
stores
can
get
it
i
desided
to
try
it
after
my
friend
talked
it
up
to
be
the
best
stuff
ever
but
i
was
not
impressed
it
had
about
the
same
color
as
miller
altho
a
little
darker
and
near
the
same
smell
and
taste
so
for
my
12
a
6pack
i
will
drink
miller
notes
just
too
thin
and
watery
with
not
enough
taste
to
be
a
really
good
bock
not
bad
though
the
taste
is
thin
with
a
bit
of
malt
and
diacetyl
flavors
some
bread
and
honey
notes
as
well
overall
though
it
is
not
a
comples
flavor
it
is
the
same
beginning
to
end
in
the
mouth
it
is
too
thin
with
no
significant
malt
profile
as
for
its
drinkabaility
i
could
see
people
drinking
it
everyday
if
nothing
better
is
around
but
its
a
weak
and
uneventful
beer
no
matter
if
its
in
the
bottle
or
on
tap
a
nice
bronze
color
with
an
off
white
head
leaving
occasional
lacing
interesting
aroma
of
caramel
malt
peppery
yeast
and
then
a
grapevineraison
like
scent
clean
malty
taste
not
hoppy
or
bitter
and
then
a
wine
like
finish
good
mouthfeel
a
nice
beer
that
id
order
again
i
love
shiner
bock
im
not
going
to
turn
up
my
nose
if
you
throw
a
free
one
my
way
but
if
i
had
to
pay
id
just
as
soon
leave
it
for
the
texans
the
main
problem
here
is
an
odd
metallic
flavor
on
the
finish
but
even
if
that
werent
a
problem
it
lacks
some
of
the
thickness
and
depth
that
you
can
find
in
other
bocks
even
so
its
quite
drinkable
tastes
like
brown
budweiser
not
too
good
it
smells
sort
of
sweet
and
roasty
taste
is
also
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
overly
so
very
easy
to
drink
its
best
to
pour
into
a
pint
glass
or
get
it
on
tap
at
the
pub
havent
been
to
the
spoetzl
brewery
yet
but
cant
wait
to
have
a
fresh
one
there
a
nice
amber
colored
brew
with
a
slightly
sweet
smell
highly
carbonated
body
and
minimal
frothy
head
on
tap
this
is
a
much
better
beer
than
in
its
bottled
form
a
much
fresher
tasting
brew
with
hightened
characteristics
i
had
the
brew
directly
at
the
spoetzel
brewery
a
few
years
ago
and
enjoyed
it
imensly
ive
yet
to
have
that
experience
again
with
this
beer
drinking
this
to
compare
to
the
shiner
bock
i
had
ontap
earlier
this
week
appearance
is
a
nice
dark
copper
color
slightly
ruby
when
it
hits
the
light
smell
isnt
very
strong
slightly
sweet
smelling
with
hint
of
alcohol
smell
taste
is
quite
nice
not
spectacular
but
malty
enough
to
enjoy
this
is
an
easily
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
see
becoming
one
of
my
standard
fridge
stock
versus
tap
the
bottle
has
less
of
a
full
mouthfeel
and
is
slightly
less
malty
in
flavor
i
like
it
on
tap
a
little
better
but
the
differences
are
tiny
one
of
my
favorite
all
time
brews
but
ive
had
plenty
of
beers
since
then
that
have
expanded
my
horizons
itll
still
be
an
old
standby
but
with
so
many
new
beers
to
try
theres
plenty
of
other
things
to
drink
this
went
down
easy
because
it
makes
no
demands
on
the
palate
whatsoever
its
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
thats
already
an
overcrowded
field
so
theres
really
no
need
to
seek
this
out
unless
youre
hankering
for
a
taste
of
the
lone
star
state
the
neck
label
actually
states
that
shiner
bock
is
rich
smooth
and
bold
0
for
3
id
say
three
strikes
and
youre
out
drinkability
my
favorite
texas
beer
when
it
comes
to
session
picks
goes
down
easily
more
than
a
lawnmower
beer
but
not
too
heavy
to
enjoy
in
this
texas
heat
thanks
to
assurbanipaul
for
the
sample
pours
amberbrown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
malty
aroma
taste
is
initially
sweet
malt
that
gives
way
to
a
more
toasted
malt
flavor
corn
adjunct
flavors
are
also
apparent
just
enough
hops
to
add
a
little
welcome
bitterness
to
the
middle
thin
mouthfeel
slightly
astringent
finish
considerably
better
than
a
macro
but
not
what
id
consider
an
outstanding
beer
still
it
does
have
its
charm
and
is
a
good
example
of
a
style
american
bock
that
was
once
much
more
popular
than
it
is
now
brew
pours
a
golden
yellow
very
crisp
and
clear
very
little
head
slightly
sweet
taste
and
smell
little
to
no
hop
note
present
at
all
definately
a
maltdomminant
brew
nice
mouthfeel
an
emminently
quafable
brew
an
excellent
brew
for
a
summers
bbq
or
casual
events
where
you
need
to
bring
a
beer
that
wont
be
wasted
on
the
masses
yet
still
shows
you
get
beer
i
had
not
tasted
a
shiner
bock
for
a
couple
of
years
prior
to
this
review
but
fate
brought
us
together
in
time
for
this
writing
it
pours
out
a
nice
deep
reddishamber
color
a
moderate
head
quickly
formed
and
just
as
quickly
disappeared
not
much
lacing
to
talk
about
either
smell
is
a
difficult
topic
for
me
not
a
good
sniffer
but
it
was
not
particularly
strong
taste
is
soso
nothing
bad
but
nothing
wow
malty
but
i
prefer
a
much
maltier
flavor
some
carbonation
perhaps
a
little
too
much
not
much
hop
character
pretty
simple
straight
forward
mediumcolored
beer
it
gets
some
points
on
the
drinkability
scale
for
being
simple
and
a
little
thin
but
elsewhere
it
really
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
macrobrewed
crowd
first
off
ive
yet
to
find
a
bock
that
really
made
me
say
wow
that
being
said
this
is
just
another
average
bock
at
best
pours
a
light
brown
with
hints
of
red
a
slight
white
head
will
arise
and
fall
nothing
spectacular
the
smell
is
very
malty
otherwise
not
much
detected
the
taste
is
a
little
to
sweet
not
many
hops
detected
caramel
malts
are
in
the
forefront
very
light
bodied
and
not
very
refreshingly
crisp
and
smooth
dryness
wouldnt
go
back
to
this
again
anytime
soon
had
numerous
experiences
with
this
brew
during
the
week
of
april
25
may
1st
on
a
cruise
out
of
houston
tx
it
was
a
nice
change
from
the
bud
and
coors
light
corona
miller
products
etc
not
a
bad
brew
pours
to
a
copper
color
with
a
white
bubbly
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
slight
roasted
malt
and
caramel
but
they
seem
to
be
difficult
to
pick
up
not
a
bad
smelling
brew
compared
to
the
macros
that
where
available
but
not
very
robust
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aromas
not
much
depth
but
enough
going
on
to
make
it
an
enjoyable
experience
was
able
to
handle
the
hot
sticky
weather
with
this
brew
so
it
fit
the
bill
over
all
i
would
get
this
brew
if
it
was
available
in
ny
state
once
in
a
while
nice
coppery
color
with
medium
head
good
carbonation
and
the
lace
stayed
around
smell
was
fresh
and
malty
taste
was
very
drinkable
malty
and
a
hop
presence
a
little
dry
mouth
feel
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
becoming
more
available
here
in
iowa
this
one
was
much
better
than
my
recollection
of
past
samplings
this
texan
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
copper
body
with
a
one
finger
ivory
head
the
head
doesnt
last
very
long
and
some
minimal
patch
lacing
is
left
on
the
pint
glass
aroma
has
some
caramel
or
toffee
notes
and
a
restrained
germanhallertau
lager
style
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
features
medium
carbonation
taste
immediately
reveals
a
lighter
body
than
the
mouthfeel
caramel
sweetness
is
dominant
in
the
flavor
profile
but
is
evenly
balanced
by
the
germanic
hops
in
the
background
this
is
a
tasty
brew
for
an
american
regional
and
far
above
average
in
that
context
finish
is
clean
and
leaves
no
aftertaste
a
very
pleasant
drinkability
factor
but
its
not
really
a
bock
or
a
dunkel
lager
to
be
honest
im
at
a
loss
on
how
to
caterorize
this
one
but
its
certainly
a
better
tasting
brew
than
i
was
expecting
ive
been
eying
this
one
for
weeks
and
just
picked
up
a
single
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
with
a
small
head
and
good
wavy
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
clean
and
slightly
grainy
with
a
hint
of
bittersweet
hops
the
taste
is
similarly
clean
but
simple
save
for
a
curious
series
of
sweet
floral
notes
at
the
finish
otherwise
its
a
well
balanced
if
slightly
bland
brew
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
the
drinkability
is
great
and
versatile
i
can
see
this
being
very
refreshing
and
can
vouch
for
its
perfect
fit
with
a
hearty
meal
decent
average
stuff
that
i
might
snag
again
in
a
pinch
this
beer
is
a
dark
brown
colored
beer
clear
bodied
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
on
top
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
scent
is
malted
lagered
water
the
taste
is
more
like
some
of
the
dunkels
ive
had
than
any
bock
its
main
features
are
caramel
malts
but
they
are
not
as
upfront
or
strong
as
they
should
be
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
worth
a
repeat
purchase
drinkability
is
good
this
stuff
was
great
when
drank
with
bbq
in
san
antonio
texas
although
it
does
not
match
my
memories
from
several
years
and
owners
ago
it
is
drinkable
this
bottled
beer
poured
a
clear
medium
caramel
brown
with
a
short
beige
head
that
disappeared
quickly
low
carbonation
the
aroma
was
malty
sweet
and
grainy
with
hint
of
honey
or
molasses
the
taste
was
weak
and
a
tad
too
sweet
and
could
use
more
hops
for
a
better
balance
with
the
malt
sweetness
the
body
was
medium
to
thin
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
its
drinkable
its
a
just
above
average
american
lager
i
dare
say
if
i
lived
in
deepest
texas
this
would
be
a
great
beer
considering
its
a
decent
beer
though
and
would
be
a
great
summer
sipper
tastes
just
like
it
smells
a
little
tang
at
the
end
but
nothing
disrupting
its
just
so
smooth
it
just
fills
your
mouth
up
so
nicely
you
could
really
drink
this
all
night
with
no
problem
this
is
one
solid
built
beer
very
drinkable
but
nothing
extraordinary
i
had
to
ask
the
bartender
if
he
really
poured
me
a
bock
not
a
beer
id
ever
feel
like
drinking
again
but
id
slug
it
in
a
pinch
considering
its
popularity
in
its
home
state
im
rather
relieved
that
certain
texans
are
choosing
this
instead
of
lone
star
drinkability
i
think
id
rather
not
repeat
this
experience
ever
again
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
among
them
j
was
a
regular
brown
lager
in
appearance
this
beer
was
as
average
as
it
comes
smooth
flavor
but
lacking
anything
special
or
different
it
was
better
than
a
macrobrew
but
i
still
wasnt
impressed
its
good
if
you
are
stuck
with
that
or
ab
or
miller
products
well
this
is
a
standard
i
drank
alot
while
living
in
north
carolina
because
the
people
i
hung
out
with
thought
this
was
a
special
beer
pours
a
amberbrown
with
a
light
off
white
colored
head
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
lightly
sweet
and
a
little
earthy
taste
is
watery
in
my
opinion
with
some
resdual
caramel
sweetness
but
not
muchnot
much
of
a
bock
for
sure
this
is
a
pretty
bland
beer
there
are
some
good
tastes
lurking
but
theyre
too
shy
to
show
themselves
confidently
its
kind
of
like
an
amber
na

a
little
more
bite
and
flavor

to
find

so
i
dont

now
after
consuming
several
hundred
gallons
of
this
beer

can
tell
you
this
dont
bother
drinking
it
unless
you
can
get
it
on

its
no
good
out
of
the

the
carbonation
mouthfeel

is

way
to

smooth
maltyness
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
smooth
aftertaste
is
malty
not
bitter
well
i
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
because
i
finally
got
some
my
fatherinlaw
gave
me
what
he
had
left
of
a
12pack
that
he
bought
the
other
day
not
to
say
he
doesnt
like
it
he
just
doesnt
drink
enough
to
keep
the
whole
thing
to
himself
this
is
one
of
my
old
favorites
and
it
was
quite
a
trip
to
go
back
and
try
it
after
all
the
others
ive
now
had
really
much
different
than
i
remember
but
all
around
still
good
and
refreshing
goes
great
with
popcorn
and
football
still
like
it
just
not
the
same
as
before
try
this
one
with
a
couple
of
friends
some
good
texmex
and
a
football
game
im
bettin
youll
like
it
lance
armstrongs
favorite
beer
had
this
one
at
the
brickskellar
in
washington
dc
amber
in
color
offwhite
head
some
faint
aromas
malt
and
some
roastiness
not
much
in
the
way
of
smells
here
taste
is
smooth
malty
and
with
a
nice
roastedsmoky
flavor
not
like
a
smoked
beer
but
very
roasted
hops
are
unable
to
bust
through
the
smoke
not
bad
probably
good
with
texmex
its
not
a
true
bock
though
maybe
i
should
carry
this
stuff
in
my
water
bottles
during
bike
races
maybe
not
shiner
in
the
bottle
helped
the
appearance
for
me
by
providing
a
much
better
pour
it
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
good
offwhite
head
though
it
does
fade
to
a
thin
film
quickly
the
aroma
is
malty
as
with
the
taste
the
mouth
is
left
alittle
tart
and
dry
the
body
i
thought
was
alittle
thin
for
a
darker
brew
an
ok
brew
for
something
texas
born
and
off
the
beatnpath
for
an
ohio
guy
like
myself
had
to
try
it
flavor
shiner
bock
has
very
little
taste
its
not
a
bock
its
a
notch
above
the
megaswills
but
thats
about
it
head
sticks
around
a
little
longer
than
the
bottled
version
body
is
clear
medium
orangebrown
aroma
is
lightly
malty
toasted
light
bread
caramel
with
a
light
fruity
smell
flavor
is
a
lightly
sweet
acidic
bitter
combo
finish
is
nice
light
to
medium
body
watery
texture
with
lively
carbonation
well
the
first
time
i
tangled
with
shiner
was
back
in
costa
mesa
last
summer
and
we
had
a
pretty
hot
waitress
from
texas
i
asked
what
i
should
order
a
yard
of
because
i
wanted
to
experience
drinking
out
a
vessel
that
stood
three
feet
tall
boy
i
am
glad
i
ordered
then
what
a
great
beer
to
drink
from
a
yard
not
to
full
bodied
or
flavored
just
enough
of
everything
to
be
enjoyed
in
that
style
of
drinking
beer
now
here
i
am
back
home
and
sitting
here
noting
the
visual
aspects
of
this
beer
it
pours
amber
ruby
with
an
off
white
cream
colored
head
about
two
fingers
worth
and
quickly
dwindles
down
to
a
thin
collar
of
lace
only
to
leave
scattered
lacing
with
each
sip
aromatics
on
this
beer
are
well
a
little
faint
with
a
slight
caramel
malt
tone
but
no
real
hop
aroma
to
be
found
taste
is
creamy
buttered
caramel
malts
with
faint
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
and
touches
of
dark
roasts
add
to
the
experience
mediocre
at
best
with
a
thin
body
artificial
carbonation
not
much
of
anything
special
going
on
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
fact
that
i
can
consume
alot
of
this
even
a
yard
glass
of
this
however
its
not
a
quality
brew
that
i
would
buy
religiously
clearish
coppery
brown
with
small
top
of
ivory
colored
foam
that
doesnt
last
lace
in
minimal
spotty
fashion
smell
is
mostly
caramel
with
a
bit
of
molasses
soft
plain
malty
nose
thats
fair
but
not
moderate
taste
is
a
thinnish
caramel
malt
with
a
toffee
or
molasses
hinting
in
some
bigger
sips
but
it
really
lacks
a
good
flavor
punch
its
just
enough
to
take
notice
but
not
enough
to
enjoy
really
kinda
bland
for
a
bock
feel
is
a
diluted
mess
thats
a
bit
watered
down
and
thin
for
a
bock
as
well
not
much
to
it
passabal
reddish
and
auburn
color
medium
head
has
a
very
light
and
crisp
taste
an
excellent
overall
flavor
just
a
hint
of
hops
leaves
a
ver
pleasing
aftertaste
excellent
drinkable
beer
its
overall
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
has
the
body
that
tells
you
this
is
a
beer
with
care
and
meant
to
be
enjoyed
a
very
good
session
beer
carbonation
stands
out
and
makes
the
beer
refreshing
not
the
heavy
feel
one
might
expect
a
nice
brew
to
relax
with
on
a
summer
evening
not
a
fan
at
all
pours
a
darkgolden
color
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
thin
fizzy
head
slightly
hoppy
aroma
but
nothing
even
close
to
the
malty
doughy
smell
that
a
true
bock
would
have
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
decent
hop
finish
but
nothing
outstanding
ill
steer
clear
of
this
one
in
the
future
pretty
bad
it
pours
reddishbrown
with
next
to
no
head
no
lace
and
no
collar
it
smells
like
caramel
and
sits
heavysweet
in
the
mouth
the
taste
is
caramel
and
sugar
i
couldnt
find
any
hops
saying
it
tastes
like
coke
would
be
doing
coke
a
disservice
quite
thin
on
the
palate
with
the
malt
nowhere
near
as
dominating
as
the
nose
would
indicate
unfortunately
there
is
nothing
to
take
the
malts
place
the
finish
is
short
and
watery
shiner
is
not
the
godly
nectar
folks
round
these
parts
swear
it
is
however
it
is
quite
a
refreshing
beer
good
for
a
hot
day
and
a
dry
mouth
thanks
for
introducing
me
to
a
texas
style
bock
senior
shit
ordinarily
im
a
fan
of
bock
beers
its
one
of
the
few
lager
styles
that
i
can
tolerate
this
stuff
however
ought
to
be
called
bock
lite
or
something
like
that
because
theres
not
much
to
it
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
head
slighly
malty
in
the
nose
and
even
less
so
in
taste
very
very
bland
this
was
the
best
available
choice
in
the
u
s
airways
terminal
at
bush
international
i
should
have
had
a
bottle
of
water
beer
was
passable
with
the
fresh
oysters
i
was
eating
but
not
good
enough
to
order
a
second
ill
start
by
saying
that
i
think
the
keg
of
this
stuff
was
about
994
years
old
it
was
a
cloudy
brown
color
and
the
smell
that
spewed
forth
from
this
stuff
was
atrocious
like
a
malty
skunk
the
taste
was
even
worse
at
first
it
seemed
like
it
might
have
a
rather
pleasant
maltiness
to
it
then
the
overpowering
bitterness
took
over
and
i
cringed
as
did
everyone
else
drinking
it
people
were
actually
flocking
to
the
coors
light
wow
thats
saying
something
right
there
again
it
was
probably
skunked
and
i
would
like
to
try
it
fresh
thank
god
it
was
free
although
i
rate
this
beer
below
some
of
my
favorites
it
has
a
place
at
my
summer
barbecues
while
i
tend
to
the
pit
its
also
the
one
i
serve
to
guests
who
ask
for
mgd
or
miller
lite
its
like
they
stop
the
brewing
process
too
soon
or
something
just
not
delivering
everything
that
the
appearance
promises
in
texas
this
beer
is
on
tap
everywhere
and
ive
grown
used
to
it
over
the
years
i
just
wish
it
was
20
better
than
it
really
is
since
it
looks
100
tasty
but
only
delivers
80
of
the
taste
i
expect
whats
really
weird
is
every
time
i
drink
it
im
a
little
disappointed
every
time
youd
think
id
be
used
to
it
by
now
a
tv
actress
of
a
beer
it
always
looks
good
but
theres
just
not
all
that
much
there
it
looked
and
poured
a
medium
dark
brown
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
was
of
malts
and
hops
nothing
outstanding
the
taste
of
this
bock
had
a
no
nothing
flavor
blah
and
boring
i
cant
understand
why
some
people
rave
about
this
beer
they
should
keep
all
the
six
packs
in
texas
pass
oh
well
another
one
bites
the
dust
when
poured
the
color
was
dark
amber
with
a
quick
dissolving
light
tan
head
i
wasnt
able
to
identify
a
distinct
odor
while
drinking
it
had
a
very
quick
spicy
snap
to
it
with
a
slight
sweet
taste
on
the
sides
of
my
mouth
and
leaving
a
dry
after
taste
the
beer
actually
had
a
slight
flatness
to
it
didnt
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
carbonation
it
is
a
nice
change
to
the
mainstream
beers
you
advertised
on
tv
during
the
football
games
and
not
pass
one
up
if
offered
pours
a
clear
brownish
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
and
a
light
aroma
of
sweet
malt
it
has
a
crisp
flavor
with
notes
of
caramel
and
goes
down
so
easy
its
a
little
scary
as
others
have
mentioned
one
of
the
best
features
of
this
brew
is
that
no
matter
how
small
the
bar
in
texas
you
find
yourself
in
they
are
almost
guaranteed
to
carry
it
i
would
not
recommend
it
or
drink
it
again
in
all
likelihood
was
it
worth
the
bottle
of
traditional
gueuze
hell
no
this
beer
is
a
staple
in
my
diet
its
got
a
nice
dark
brown
slighty
red
color
it
pours
so
easily
without
ever
get
to
thick
of
a
head
the
foam
is
nice
it
fades
quickly
and
leaves
almost
no
lace
the
smell
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
the
smell
but
mostly
because
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
has
an
excellent
mouthfeel
with
with
the
caramel
flavors
and
all
its
drinkability
truely
exceptional
whether
you
slowly
drink
it
down
or
are
just
chugging
away
at
a
party
in
my
opinion
defeniently
one
of
the
best
beers
ever
brewed
body
i
hope
they
can
get
it
up
to
my
area
in
the
future
pours
a
dark
tea
color
with
excellent
clarity
with
an
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
pretty
pleasing
to
the
eye
the
smell
is
that
of
slight
caramel
tones
but
not
much
else
and
definitely
not
real
obvious
has
an
extremely
crisp
taste
with
hopcarbo
bite
on
the
nose
and
a
very
mild
too
mild
finish
i
believe
maybe
theres
decent
stuff
in
here
but
they
are
riding
the
fence
on
flavor
maybe
to
get
people
to
convert
from
an
even
lesser
complex
brew
like
you
know
the
biggies
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
and
light
bodied
not
too
bad
and
a
good
standby
beer
and
best
of
all
its
in
tejas
from
german
roots
prosit
this
is
not
número
uno
number
one
on
my
runway
dark
amber
brownish
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
head
settled
and
left
quickly
smell
was
very
much
malty
sweetness
and
some
sourness
to
it
lots
of
sweet
malt
taste
lacked
any
real
hop
balance
was
a
bit
more
watery
and
thin
than
i
remembered
mostly
an
average
beer
i
remember
this
being
much
better
needs
a
little
hops
for
balance
and
less
watery
feel
and
i
think
they
might
have
something
worthwhile
this
is
an
average
beer
it
pours
a
dark
amber
color
and
has
a
very
slight
malty
smell
its
not
really
a
bock
style
more
of
an
amber
ale
this
beer
isnt
really
bad
but
its
just
not
as
great
as
some
people
think
but
in
a
pinch
its
a
good
beer
around
here
its
on
tap
at
most
any
resteraunt
or
bar
its
a
nice
beer
for
taking
to
the
lake
or
camping
but
there
are
many
beers
i
would
pick
over
this
one
for
daily
drinking
this
is
slightly
worse
than
michelob
amber
bock
it
is
ok
if
nothing
else
besides
regular
budmillercoors
beers
are
available
at
least
it
has
some
darker
malts
in
it
to
give
it
a
little
sweetness
but
it
is
ruined
by
a
cheaper
adjuncty
watered
down
overall
flavor
and
inferior
hops
compared
to
amber
bock
as
if
they
put
enough
hops
in
these
pseudobocks
in
the
first
place
the
stores
are
too
damn
proud
of
this
productlets
drop
the
price
down
a
little
ok
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
darker
beer
that
tastes
cheap
to
actually
be
cheap
pours
a
nice
dark
amberlight
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
runs
away
very
quickly
the
smell
is
of
slight
malt
and
adjuncts
taste
is
fairly
bland
with
some
light
malt
sweetness
adjunct
taste
is
also
present
very
fizzy
on
the
tongue
and
down
the
throat
this
brew
is
somewhat
drinkable
mainly
because
of
its
lack
of
flavor
it
seems
to
be
a
trend
among
the
shiner
line
to
be
bland
and
tasteless
it
tastes
like
someone
took
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
and
poured
a
bunch
of
water
in
it
i
wont
buy
it
again
the
dense
sticky
head
tops
a
crystal
clear
bronze
hued
brew
theres
good
lace
left
the
number
of
sips
taken
to
finish
the
beer
is
countable
i
love
that
unfortunately
this
beer
falls
short
after
that
just
a
hint
of
graininess
and
grassy
saaz
hop
in
aroma
but
theres
not
much
else
there
the
very
mild
toasted
malt
flavors
dominate
and
the
weak
hop
bitterness
leave
the
beer
a
tad
sweet
its
got
a
bit
more
body
than
the
norm
for
style
but
the
overall
lack
of
flavor
make
this
a
run
of
the
mill
american
dark
lager
finishes
w
a
hint
of
bready
malt
notes
and
residual
sweetness
wow
this
is
the
best
bock
ive
ever
had
a
typical
american
macro
lager
with
color
spoetzl
brewery
should
be
fined
for
the
gross
misrepresentation
of
this
brew
bock
right
i
let
it
warm
up
to
try
and
find
a
redeeming
quality
but
it
just
got
worse
i
ask
you
what
is
the
point
if
you
want
a
pretty
beer
buy
shiner
bock
if
you
want
flavor
buy
something
else
it
looks
pretty
nice
but
the
experience
goes
downhill
from
there
i
drank
it
on
draught
over
three
nights
at
three
different
bars
and
received
a
beer
with
no
head
and
little
carbonation
the
flavor
was
bland
and
uninspired
it
felt
like
it
was
sticking
to
the
inside
of
my
mouth
after
i
finished
my
first
pint
i
gave
it
more
than
a
fair
shake
based
on
numerous
recommendations
by
texans
but
its
nothing
special
deep
red
amber
in
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
aroma
is
mostly
of
alcohol
and
a
little
maltiness
in
general
a
bit
weak
the
taste
was
less
than
i
expected
certainly
seemed
watery
for
a
bock
a
little
malt
and
some
faint
hop
notes
better
than
the
worst
of
the
major
beers
but
that
is
not
saying
much
much
better
bockstyle
beers
are
readily
had
the
color
is
kind
of
cool
like
a
wellbrewed
glass
of
iced
tea
being
a
southerner
i
can
appreciate
that
a
foamy
head
dissipates
quickly
nothing
spectacular
in
smell
or
tast
its
like
most
of
the
macros
but
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
it
must
have
been
partly
cloudy
when
the
beer
gods
were
shining
down
on
this
beer
for
a
bock
it
is
very
light
in
body
almost
watery
but
it
does
have
a
good
taste
to
it
although
the
taste
is
faint
definitely
on
the
malty
side
maybe
more
of
a
vienna
style
i
get
zero
hopping
on
this
the
ba
review
which
i
usually
try
not
to
read
before
doing
my
as
to
not
influence
my
opinion
mentioned
caramel
and
i
definitely
agree
with
that
the
malt
taste
is
not
heavy
but
there
seems
easy
on
the
mouth
and
would
be
pretty
easy
drinking
overall
just
not
as
much
body
as
i
expect
in
a
bock
copper
in
color
big
frothy
head
that
dissipates
into
nearly
nothing
in
moments
last
time
i
was
visiting
a
buddy
in
college
station
i
picked
up
a
six
of

bock
i
had
this
right
after
visiting
the
civil
war
museum
in
kenosha
so
the
taste
of
civil
rights
was
lingering
ever
so
slightly
on
my
palate
they
served
this
to
us
first
thing
upon
starting
the
tour
it
was
good
but
like
the
tour
it
was
short
lived
if
you
like
winter
lagers
you
might
dig
it
didnt
hold
up
in
flavor
as
well
as
aroma
but
still
pretty
complex
and
good
melanoidin
character
would
love
to
try
one

very

this

and
very
smooth
to

a
very

offering
onot
really
strong
or
bitter
enough
for
a
bock
profile
but
more
of
a
lightbodied
brown

flavor
and
body
are
enough
for
a
decent
session
ale
i
might
buy
again
or
try
on
tap
seems
sort
of
flat
and
o
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
in
the
style
that
has
a
nice
amount
of
flavors
but
isnt
that
fullbodied
its
a
good
choice
if
you
are
looking
for
something
that
is
malty
but
not
that
filling
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
bodied
with
slightly
below
mediumlevel
carbonation
resultant
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
generally
smooth
flowing
the
beer
foaming
up
just
slightly
on
the
palate
the
lower
carbonation
actually
fits
this
beer
as
it
is
something
to
roll
around
on
the
palate
and
not
drink
quickly
sweet
thick
crusted
bread
with
a
spritz
of
plum
or
prune
jelly
yeasty
malty
toasty
and
lightly
roasted
this
beer
comes
together
well
but
with
a
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
one
after
the
other
pitty
i
have
to
wait
till
winter
to
buy
this
again
o
this
was
okay
as
far
as
winter
brews
are
concerned
i
will
look
for
some
other
options
before
i
head
back
to
this
one
bottle
from
rileys
in
madison
pours
a
mildly
thick
broth
it
did
have
some
bulk
to
the
mouthfeel
a
tad
sour
rather
than
bitter
though
hops
shine
at
end
initially
tasty
bock
with
complex
malt
and
then
drinkability
elapsed
as
i
found
it
far
from
complex
carbonation
a
tad
aggressive
winter
brew
is
a
highly
acclaimed
munichstyle
dunkel
bock
that
lives
up
to
its
local
reputation
tastes
stronger
than
it
is
they
should
make
this
into
an
even
lower
alcohol
beer
with
so
much
flavor
found
this
one
far
from
home
in
asheville
at
the
great
bruisin
ales
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
rather
fast
diminishing
head
has
a
heavy
cocoa
scent
upon
tasting
there
is
a
heavy
taste
of
robust
malts
mixed
with
carmel
and
a
coffee
taste
definetly
a
very
heavy
bock
that
almost
borderlines
a
stout
like
taste
not
anything
you
will
be
able
to
drink
fast
this
beer
has
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
im
glad
this
showed
up
in
my
market
to
give
it
a
try
but
if
i
want
a
winterspecific
beer
to
warm
myself
by
ill
pick
another
first
this
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
perfume
and
more
caramel
this
is
a
very
german
aroma
the
taste
is
full
of
caramel
and
toffee
it
is
flavorful
but
lacks
true
depth
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
cloyingly
sticky
carbonation
is
mild
overall
this
is
a
nice
bock
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
that
i
would
turn
to
before
trying
this
beer
again
sprecher
does
an
excellent
job
crafting
german
lager
styles
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
have
always
liked
this
beer
quite
a
good
winter
beer
that
i
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
more
often
when
the
season
rolls
around
d
a
pretty
decent
brew
i
could
drink
one
or
two
after
a
meal
not
my
first
choice
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
d
a
good
brew
i
might
not
always
come
back
for
a
second
one
this
winter
brew
lacks
the
holiday
spices
something
many
beer
aficionados
will
be
pleased
to
find
no
faults
detected
but
somewhat
lacking
in
interest
d
not
bad
it
tasted
alright
but
failed
to
be
really
impressive
in
any
way
i
wasnt
disappointed
but
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
why
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
the
smoke
tone
was
a
pleasant
surprise
a
very
nice
bock
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
spritzy
and
chewy
really
good
winter
brew
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice

with
some
nice
sticky

the
nose

note
the
taste
is

a

medium

drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
one
i
would
certainly
enjoy
again
thanks
for
wjvii
i
was
able
to
give
it
a
sampling
d
i
was
pretty
disappointed
drinking
this
one
i
like
most
winter
beers
and
i
like
bocks
so
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
the
dirty
taste
is
too
much
for
me
but
if
you
like
dirty
mop
water
give
it
a
shot
drinkability
one
and
im
done
maybe
i
am
over
spiced
beers
for
the
christmas
season
but
it
was
a
bit
difficult
to
finish
this
up
d
this
is
quite
a
nice
bock
im
pleasantly
pleased
as
i
finish
it
but
not
overly
surprised
as
ive
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
the

seem
to
do

very
nice

despite
the
hops
becoming
slightly
distracting
drinking
it

had

seems
to
improve
the
malts
slightly

carry
a
very
good

this
fresh

expect
it
to
be

my
favorites

i
would
definitely
have
another
on

one
in
my
opinion
but
still
enjoyable
nonetheless
i
also
think
this
would
be
much
better

this
kinda
old

poured
a

this

has
a

some

the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
mixture
of
the
mild

there
is
a
little
more
than
a
medium
body
this
is
a
solid
seasonal
brew
better
in
the
coldness
of
a
winter
than
the
heat
of
summer
very
good
brew
from
sprecher
as
usual
maybe
i
was
just
thirsty
after
work
but
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
sprecher
brew
i
picked
up
a
variety
8
pack
from
sprecher
at
santoris
liquors
in
lansing
il
my
last
time
in
the
chicago
area
to
visit
family
and
wow
i
ve
heard
great
things
from
sprecher
and
would
have
to
say
its
quite
a
good
little
brewery
watch
out
miller
while
nothing
astonishing
this
is
a
very
good
bock
thats
hard
to
pass
up
an
ok
beer
not
one
to
revisit
di
did
like
this
despite
its
shortcomings
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
full
flavour
and
body
somewhat
undertoned
in
taste
and
thin
of
body
this
wasnt
too
bad
a
little
more
robust
taste
and
thicker
body
would
have
been
welcomed
but
for
what
it
is
its
still
fairly
flavorfull
and
drinkable
bought
a
sprecher
sampler
and
this
is
a
close
second
to
black
bavarian
d
a
solid
bock
drinkability
is
average
for
this
style
heavy
inside
but
goes
down
well
i
think
this
is
a
little
thin
for
a
bock
slightly
smoky
caramel
flavor
mostly
light
hint
of
cocoa
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
session
pretty
wellrounded
without
any
detectable
flaws
not
a
bad
choice
usually
pretty
cheap
it
was
4
at
handlebar
ultimately
too
thin
for
me
but
a
decent
bock
not
quite
good
enough
for
a
winter
ale
though
shouldnt
a
bock
be
a
spring
seasonal
more
malt
more
hops
please
cheers
would
not
consider
this
a
session
beer
for
me
not
much
going
on
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
fine
and
it
would
be
worth
grabbing
a
second
or
third
of
this
if
it
were
tastier
yet
that
wont
happen
before
i
get
my
hands
on
other
winter
brews
this
needs
more
umph
id
recommend
more
spiciness
a
little
more
kick
with
hops
and
more
fruit
as
well
to
blend
with
the
rest
not
a
bad
beer
mind
you
just
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
nor
as
i
had
hoped
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
all
that
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
while
but
not
one
that
i
would
want
to
drink
for
an
extended
period
of
time
this
is
not
an
unpleasant
beer
but
it
is
too
light
on
the
malts
and
it
does
not
really
warm
up
very
limited
and
i
will
not
buy
it
again
my
high
hopes
for
sprecher
winter
brew
havent
been
realized
im
sure
they
sell
a
lot
of
it
up
wisconsin
way
but
other
than
a
good
look
and
an
easy
unchallenging
drinkability
i
dont
see
the
attraction

on
the
tongue
nice
on
the
whole
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
probably
would
not
have
thought
about
buying
itpicked
it
up
due
to
price
and
a
whim
though
out
of
season
now
it
was
well
worth
the
taste
moderate
to
almost
full
mouth
that
gets
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
clear
the
palate
not
my
favorite
style
yet
i
like
this
beer
and
will
buy
it
again
for
when
im
in
the
mood
to
step
outside
of
my
usual
styles
pours
a
lovely
clear
ruby
brown
with
a
real
good
frothy
head
lasting
a
good
5
minutes
tan
in
color
with
falling
foamy
lacing
down
the
glass
relatively
weak
aroma
of
mildly
roasted
malts
yielding
brown
sugar
and
a
twinge
of
toffee
and
a
slight
hop
spice
to
boot
good
just
need
more
taste
starts
slow
kind
of
bland
idea
of
malts
toffee
then
through
the
middle
malts
turns
to
brown
sugar
and
then
a
slight
hop
bittering
toward
the
end
finishing
with
dark
fruits
ending
with
that
bitter
body
has
a
decent
weight
to
it
smooth
enough
but
nothing
special
overall
probably
good
brew
from
what
im
beginning
to
understand
is
an
unererrated
brewery
nice
final
thought
i
just
picked
this
one
up
a
few
weeks
ago
as
a
1
special
and
special
it
was
appearance
wise
this
one
passes
the
test
with
a
deep
roasted
redbrown
body
and
beautiful
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
just
a
little
too
quickly
nice
balanced
carbonation
drinkablity
suffers
only
from
the
aforementioned
brown
sugar
16
ounce
bottle
sprecher
winter
brew
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
ruby
tint
theres
just
a
small
head
on
this
beer
toasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
fruit
the
flavor
starts
out
with
toasted
malt
fruit
and
cocoa
come
in
at
the
middle
a
little
nutty
the
finish
is
bitter
with
grassy
hops
this
beer
is
not
thick
but
it
is
very
flavorful
drinkability
is
very
high
unlike
many
bocks
this
beer
is
poundable
great
winter
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
flavorful
but
not
too
heavy
regardless
a
quaffer
i
downed
multiple
pints
of
without
batting
an
eye
good
brew
i
havent
had
enough
of
the
style
though
another
great
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
a
very
well
balanced
and
interesting
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
all
night
the
tan
head
is
full
and
recedes
to
a
patchy
film
after
a
short
while
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
with
toffee
very
well
balanced
with
lots
of
malt
flavor
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
prevent
an
overly
sweet
taste
no
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
substantial
enough
to
register
but
no
more
dead
on
i
can
drink
these
all
night
oh
how
i
would
love
to
try
this
ontap
someday
im
thinking
the
chocolate
tones
would
really
take
over
and
make
for
an
almost
creamed
porterlike
experience
still
this
bottled
version
is
sublime
drinkability
is
very
easy
goin
and
lubricious
goes
down
fast
and
without
much
effort
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
from
sprecher
putting
the
ofest
and
black
bavarian
a
close
second
great
stuff
pours
a
hazy
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
small
light
brown
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
sweet
chocolate
cookie
dough
and
dark
fruit
aromas
plum
dark
cherry
caramel
smoky
chocolate
flavors
that
blend
together
so
nicely
medium
to
full
bodied
and
a
very
smooth
velvety
soft
mouthfeel
nice
sweet
candy
like
finish
i
just
wish
i
had
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
well
done
lager
this
beer
is
just
beautiful
a
deep
coppery
garnet
with
a
light
brown
head
i
probably
should
have
taken
a
photo
the
aroma
is
initially
roasted
with
hints
of
chocolate
but
as
it
warms
it
changes
to
nutty
with
hints
of
toffee
and
spicey
yeast
the
flavor
is
clean
and
malty
with
a
lingering
yeast
flavor
on
my
tongue
this
beer
is
excellent
a
special
thanks
goes
out
to
my
friend
who
bought
this
for
me
for
xmas
thanks
go
to
minnesotahuge
for
this
spretzer
seasonal
winter
brew
sehr
gut
sir
a
solid
beer
all
the
way
big
and
roasty
with
plenty
of
juice
to
warm
you
up
easy
to
enjoy
i
just
really
liked
this
one
drinkability
is
very
solid
on
this
another
great
sprecher
offering
if
you
like
winter
brews
or
more
malty
brews
please
look
this
one
up
and
try
it
out
tasted
at
the
goose
island
april
beer
academy
lots
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
as
it
pours
a
mediumbrown
color
with
an
offtan
head
the
scent
isnt
huge
perhaps
a
bit
of
malt
but
nothing
more
the
taste
is
a
bit
hoppy
with
only
a
minimal
amount
of
malt
presence
especially
for
a
bock
a
bit
thin
and
chalky
for
my
taste
and
nothing
much
more
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
body
of
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
something
fuller
but
it
was
pretty
light
on
the
thin
side
carbonation
was
dead
on
just
lively
enough
for
my
tastes
a
nice
winter
offering
pretty
straightforward
in
its
approach
though
oh
man
this
is
the
shizznat
had
this
on
tap
at
old
chicago
during
their
christmas
minitour
and
have
bought
a
few
four
packs
of
this
recently
despite
its
midoctober
bornon
date
and
sprechers
recommendation
that
you
consume
their
beer
within
120
days
this
still
tastes
great
those
of
you
familiar
with
the
style
of
winter
seasonals
will
feel
right
at
home
with
this
beer
in
its
dark
color
heavybutnotastout
taste
and
unique
spice
flavor
this
beer
is
a
spectacular
entry
in
the
style
and
is
the
only
one
of
two
goose
island
being
the
other
that
i
have
liked
enough
to
purchase
a
fourpack
of
another
good
point
about
this
beer
is
the
16
oz
bottles
try
and
snatch
up
some
of
this
while
you
can
so
that
you
dont
have
to
wait
until
next
year
because
its
cheap
at
least
in
the
midwest
sprecher
is
from
wisconsin
and
good
highly
recommended
i
would
have
given
this
a
better
appearance
but
i
had
no
option
other
than
drinking
it
out
of
the
bottle
so
i
cant
give
an
accurate
rating
as
far
as
everything
else
goes
this
was
a
fantastic
winter
brew
there
was
a
nice
full
body
of
spices
that
balanced
perfectly
i
have
been
waiting
all
winter
to
try
this
local
favorite
and
i
sure
am
glad
that
i
did
this
is
not
my
favorite
winter
beer
but
the
smoothness
makes
it
drinkerfriendly
chestnut
brown
creamy
cafe
au
lait
head
warming
goodness
in
the
way
of
malt
on
the
nose
and
in
the
mouth
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
just
right
for
the
winter
here
in
the
midwest
a
good
dose
of
dark
chocolate
caramel
malted
chewy
candy
candy
chimes
in
throughout
a
solid
fresh
and
rather
tasty
seasonal
nice
rich
brown
color
with
a
real
nice
creamy

ead
smell
was
swwet
and
almost
cookiedough
liketaste
was
roasted
and
burnt
tasting
with
some
caramel
sweetness
sprecher
makes
some
really
good
beers
and
this
is
just
another
good
onewill
be
trying
there
doppell
bock
later
today
clear
slightly
watery
finish
a
tasty
winter
brew
almost
a
cross
between
a
dunkel
and
a
bock
almost
a
tad
thin
to
be
a
bock
but
it
has
some
of
its
sweeter
characteristics
nose
is
sweet
malt
alll
the
way
it
is
a
reddish
amber
in
color
the
taste
is
roasted
grains
and
sweet
malt
finishes
with
a
bock
like
feel
body
is
about
medium
definitely
think
enough
to
drink
a
few
but
not
too
thin
i
like
this
beer
but
have
had
better
bocks
it
is
very
good
though
this
brew
has
a
clear
deep
dark
mahogony
appearance
throws
out
a
creamy
light
brown
head
that
has
decent
retention
it
eventually
does
recede
to
a
thin
film
but
still
laces
rather
effectively
malt
toffee
and
caramel
all
mix
in
on
the
nose
toffee
toasted
malt
burnt
caramel
and
some
slight
hoproasted
bitterness
come
to
play
on
the
palate
this
is
not
as
sweet
as
most
bocks
but
to
me
rather
it
tastes
almost
like
a
hybrid
of
bock
and
scwarzbier
i
thought
this
was
a
dopplebock
but
its
not
as
thick
and
chewy
as
a
dopple
so
i
was
probably
wrong
this
beer
won
a
gold
at
the
2002
world
cup
in
the
europeanstylemuncher
dunkel
category
its
a
smooth
beer
and
tasty
body
is
almost
full
rich
pour
dark
copper
brown
with
a
14
inch
yellowish
head
really
very
little
aroma
some
sense
of
sweetness
mediumbodied
with
assertive
malt
somewhat
dunkellike
with
lots
of
nutty
qualities
proceeds
toward
a
bit
of
a
buttery
diacetyl
and
ends
gradually
with
little
sense
of
distinct
hopping
becomes
creamier
mid
mouth
with
a
little
bit
of
corn
husk
qualities
in
the
big
aftertaste
not
a
bad
brew
here
not
as
sweet
as
some
bocks
but
im
not
a
major
fan
ill
take
the
black
bavarian
pours
a
clear
dark
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
aroma
consists
of
burnt
malt
caramel
coffee
and
picks
up
a
plum
or
cherry
scent
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
roasted
malt
and
coffee
tones
dominate
finish
builds
on
roasted
malt
flavor
and
a
subtle
sweet
fruit
and
spice
flavor
rounds
things
out
an
enjoyable
and
rather
hearty
fullbodied
munich
bock
great
for
having
on
hand
to
share
with
company
during
the
winter
season
and
throughout
spring
as
things
thaw
out
just
a
great
winter
brew
one
of
my
favorite
bocks
my
alltime
favorite
until
i
encountered
elysians
pandoras
bock
absolutely
fantastic
beer
this
is
my
first
review
and
i
had
to
make
it
sprecher
winter
understated
dried
fruit
flavors
with
a
richness
that
is
perfect
for
winter
deep
russet
brown
with
no
head
anda
very
minimal
lace
decent
carbonation
was
evident
smell
was
grainey
with
a
slighlty
off
fruit
aroma
in
the
back
anda
hint
at
some
bitterness
the
taste
intrestingalbeit
not
very
comple
x
at
all
sort
of
a
glammed
up
amber
lots
of
malt
with
a
slight
bittering
hops
presence
and
a
hint
at
maybe
something
fruity
in
the
back
if
its
there
it
is
very
faint
overall
i
cannot
say
it
is
horrible
as
i
have
had
much
much
worse
beer
this
poured
out
as
a
pretty
nice
looking
brown
color
the
head
wasnt
too
bad
either
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
nice
malt
character
to
it
the
taste
followed
behind
pretty
closely
with
the
malts
giving
off
a
sweet
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
medium
a
little
light
for
this
style
overall
its
a
decent
brew
but
not
the
best
d
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
i
could
easily
quaff
a
sixer
of
this
in
a
night
im
very
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
brew
md
nice
carbonation
and
mild
flavor
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
a
decent
bock
but
nothing
to
seek
out
probably
stegs
second
best
cheers
drinkability
quite
high
nice
smells
and
solid
flavors
it
feels
like
a
moderate
abv
and
the
price
was
right
so
i
would
definitely
grab
this
again
average
to
above
average
lower
priced
bock
will
satisfy
someone
looking
for
an
uncomplicated
nonhopcentric
drink
after
having
reviewed
three
lessthanstellar
beers
from
lion
brewery
i
couldnt
be
more
surprised
that
stegmaier
brewhouse
bock
is
as
good
as
it
is
since
bocks
are
among
my
least
favorite
styles
that
ought
to
count
for
something
d
easy
drinking
and
quite
good
for
a
session
this
is
a
great
beer
for
washing
down
a
couple
slices
of
pizza
i
would
order
this
again
in
the
philly
area
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
lighter
amber
color
with
a
very
thin
head
even
with
a
moderately
aggressive
pour
there
was
no
lacing
and
carbonation
seemed
light
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
bread
with
dry
fruit
raisins
plums
and
some
spice
the
taste
is
dry
with
the
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
coming
through
not
much
to
my
liking
and
not
that
strong
for
the
style
i
am
not
a
huge
bock
fan
to
begin
with
but
i
respect
a
good
brew
this
was
a
little
below
my
expectations
d
goes
down
easy
d
a
very
good
brew
im
upset
with
myself
that
i
never
bought
this
when
i
was
in
college
only
about
a
mile
away
from
the
brewery
itself
ill
have
to
make
a
road
trip
i
think
i
will
try
this
beer
again
because
i
might
not
have
been
in
the
mood
for
it
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
red
beer
with
a
good
foamy
head
poured
with
little
head
a
thin
film
on
the
top
color
is
a
clear
copper
color
smell
is
a
little
roasty
and
sweet
carbonation
makes
for
a
crisp
taste
very
refreshing
and
i
imagine
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
a
little
bit
of
banana
sweetness
plus
a
standard
bock
maltiness
i
enjoyed
this
enough
to
want
to
buy
a
good
deal
more
there
isnt
anything
noticeably
wrong
or
especially
good
about
this
one
a
mild
hop
presence
to
balance
the
malt
could
improve
this
one
in
several
areas
very
light
in
flavor
and
rather
bitter
for
a
bock
maybe
im
used
to
doppelbocks
i
dont
love
it
nor
do
i
want
more
but
it
is
very
drinkable
d
respectable
bock
offering
but
doesnt
standout
memorable
in
any
particular
category
picked
up
a
single
bottle
at
the
beer
stop
for
around
1
50
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
appears
a
clear
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
creamy
ecru
foam
minimal
lacing
sticks
to
the
inside
of
the
glass
as
i
make
my
way
to
the
bottom
a
nice
looking
pour
smells
and
tastes
of
caramelized
malts
lightly
toasted
grains
sweet
biscuits
a
touch
of
molasses
great
sweet
malty
flavor
creamy
and
smooth
and
about
a
notch
above
medium
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
im
going
back
for
a
sixer
this
went
down
way
too
easy
on
this
chilly
early
spring
evening
a
great
beer
for
the
money
as
well
this
beer
went
well
with
my
spicy
pizza
poured
a
deep
amber
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
nice
malty
nose
reminiscent
of
an
old
world
bock
or
märzen
style
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
an
aftertaste
that
makes
you
want
to
crack
open
another
found
this
for
5
99
a
sixer
at
the
andersons
in
toledo
oh
and
at
that
price
you
cant
beat
it
you
can
spend
a
couple
bucks
more
for
less
flavor
from
some
breweries
that
do
more
marketing
and
distribute
more
widely
great
quality
from
a
regional
brewer
that
isnt
known
for
its
craft
beers
in
the
end
this
a
great
sweet
roasted
bock
beer
one
of
the
better
bock
beers
ive
had
lately
another
plus
about
this
beer
is
the
low
price
this
beer
has
im
not
sure
what
you
paid
for
a
case
of
it
but
i
only
paid
8
a
case
if
the
price
was
raised
would
i
buy
it
again
more
than
likely
i
would
buy
it
again
d
very
drinkable
bock
of
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
faint
lace
the
aroma
is
malty
with
citrus
hops
a
kind
of
a
winelike
character
it
is
thick
bodied
with
candied
malt
taste
notable
and
a
bitter
grassy
hop
kiss
a
bit
dry
and
quite
sweet
with
good
carbonation
throughout
midland
drinkable
but
overall
quite
a
solid
bock
that
i
would
like
to
sample
again
to
get
a
better
grasp
of
the
sharp
character
here
very
easy
to
drink
and
bicely
refreshing
good
middleoftheroad
beer
last
swigs
this
one
falls
short
of
the
mark
kind
of
a
messy
interpretation
with
too
much
flavor
play
that
sways
off
the
tight
guidelines
i
really
liked
this
one
a
lot
very
good
cheers
d
as
i
may
have
mentioned
before
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
and
doesnt
have
anything
bad
in
particular
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
either
though
pours
a
rich
amber
hue
with
a
nice
two
finger
light
khaki
colored
head
that
takes
a
few
minutes
to
die
down
to
a
nice
full
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
stickiness
is
good
for
this
style
smell
is
a
sugary
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
as
well
nothing
more
nothing
less
taste
is
much
of
the
same
starts
with
a
sugary
sweet
caramel
malt
mixed
with
a
bit
of
mild
chocolate
taste
very
enjoyable
surprisingly
this
one
ends
a
bit
dry
but
in
a
very
balanced
way
mouthfeel
is
slick
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
wow
i
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
down
in
a
sitting
thanks
again
to
josh
for
this
all
around
quality
made
brew
lion
brewing
is
really
producing
some
fantastic
seasonals
of
late
and
they
are
incredibly
priced
they
are
perfect
beers
for
mass
consumption
aka
when
the
family
or
friends
come
over
because
theyre
just
as
cheap
as
bmc
but
they
are
just
as
good
as
many
very
respectable
micros
keep
up
the
great
work
drinkability
was
exceptional
as
i
was
done
with
this
baby
before
i
knew
it
exceptional
beer
especially
when
you
consider
the
price
nice
job

easy

this
is
a

a
case
you
cant
go
wrong
cheers
i
saw
a
case
of
this
at
the
distributor
for
12
99
so
i
had
to
buy
it
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
orange
and
a
small
off
white
head
big
toasted
malt
nose
it
smells
very
rich
and
malty
the
taste
is
very
impressive
the
toasty
malt
dominates
with
a
hint
of
grassy
bitterness
and
a
little
caramel
sweetness
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
low
carbonation
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
beer
when
i
was
growing
up
in
ne
pa
the
stegmaier
brand
was
crap
it
was
a
real
awful
beer
it
is
great
to
see
the
brand
taken
back
its
german
roots
and
brewing
style
thanks
to
either
sacfly
or
hopsaplenty
or
whoever
the
hell
gave
this
to
me
in
my
drunken
state
at
dogfish
head
for
the
money
you
cant
beat
this
bock
another
great
product
by
steggy
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
poured
an
amber
red
colour
crystal
clear
had
a
snow
white
loosely
knit
large
bubble
head
that
totally
went
way
in
about
90
seconds
doesnt
really
look
very
exciting
to
me
looks
like
a
glass
of
tea
actually
smell
is
quite
muted
what
i
can
smell
is
faint
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
yeast
it
seems
taste
is
decent
you
could
do
much
worse
there
are
quite
a
bit
of
sweet
malts
present
here
perhaps
a
touch
of
hops
hiding
in
the
back
mouthfeel
is
fair
with
moderate
carbonation
nothing
special
here
at
all
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
pretty
thin
bodied
and
the
taste
was
somewhat
thin
too
but
i
may
be
getting
spoiled
with
the
imperial
versions
of
brews
this
still
was
a
good
session
brew
for
a
lazy
afternoon
thanks
to
beerbeing
thank
goes
to
leopoldstoch
for
this
bottle
poured
a
meduim
dark
amber
with
a
small
ring
of
off
white
foam
aroma
got
a
strange
sourness
than
some
brown
sugar
and
malt
and
a
whiff
of
alcohol
flavor
didnt
get
any
of
the
sourness
sweet
maltness
honey
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
it
was
easy
to
drink
not
to
bad
on
tap
at
the
grey
lodge
in
ne
philly
this
beer
poured
a
clearish
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
the
aroma
is
a
bit
toasted
malts
and
a
bit
floral
hops
the
taste
has
a
good
tongue
of
toasted
malts
a
bit
sweet
with
some
hop
bitterness
that
is
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
pretty
complex
another
fine
beer
from
steg
which
is
great
to
see
being
from
nepa
originally
at
this
price
youd
be
a
sucker
not
to
get
it
its
easy
drinking
but
full
of
flavor
run
right
out
a
get
some
today
if
someone
told
me
this
is
the
only
bock
i
could
ever
have
id
not
be
too
terribly
disappointedor
at
all
for
that
matter
its
simple
and
very
tasty
and
while
complex
is
alright
at
times
stripping
down
to
the
nuts
and
bolts
can
come
across
wonderfully
as
well
its
very
drinkable
for
the
lack
of
excess
effort
the
palate
has
to
make
to
enjoy
it
there
will
be
more
of
this
in
my
future
if
you
enjoy
a
bock
beer
you
should
have
a
session
with
this
new
brew
made
from
an
age
old
recipe
by
the
lion
brewery
tried
a
case
of
this
for
something
different
as
it
is
something
newer
on
the
market
what
a
pleasant
surprise
for
something
that
was
less
than
18
bucks
served
in
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
dark
amber
with
a
creamy
colored
head
that
stayed
to
visit
for
a
bit
first
smell
was
a
wonderful
toasted
carmel
malt
first
sip
was
bitterbut
pleasantclosely
smoothing
out
to
the
roasted
malt
sweet
and
creamy
heavy
aftertaste
a
great
beer
made
better
served
a
tad
bit
warmer
than
the
fridge
cant
say
what
the
alcohol
content
is
but
not
to
heavy
great
for
a
cold
night
but
not
an
all
night
beer
seems
to
fill
you
up
quite
quickly
overall
great
craft
beer
for
an
even
better
price
i
might
have
to
get
this
again
drinkability
a
nice
example
of
the
style
balanced
well
proving
that
you
can
still
have
a
nice
flavorful
beer
without
going
overboard
one
direction
or
another
d
pretty
damn
impressive
its
lovely
to
run
into
a
tasty
bock
like
this
especially
in
the
growing
and
evolving
craft
beer
world
i
could
drink
this
through
the
night
o
an
exceptional
bock
with
lots
to
offer
the
refined
pallette
overall
i
rate
this
one
as
exceptional
the
flavors
attack
the
palate
and
leave
you
satisfied
i
highly
recommend
this
one
not
as
deep
or
complex
as
other
bocks
a
little
too
sweet
a
little
too
thin
alc
high
enough
for
a
winter
beer
carbonation
is
light
but
not
bad
for
the
style
overall
drinkable
but
not
one
to
seek
out
bocks
are
one
of
my
favorites
so
my
expectations
were
high
this
is
the
first
atwater
ive
tried
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
resulting
in
a
mouthfeel
that
is
wellbalanced
between
foaminess
35
and
smoothness
25
closes
quite
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
on
the
palate
and
lips
this
is
exhibit
a
with
regard
to
what
i
have
been
saying
about
atwaters
beers
they
are
hit
or
miss
with
little
in
between
chalk
this
up
as
a
hitwoodychandlermay
16
its
a
far
cry
from
a
good
winter
beer
apple
raisin
light
fruits
but
their
winter
bock
is
an
excellent
beer
it
pours
dark
with
a
very
small
head
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
nuttiness
in
the
taste
the
smell
its
a
malty
brew
without
much
in
the
way
of
hops
its
alcohol
content
is
a
little
higher
than
one
might
expect
at
7
5
abv
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
present
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
style

another
if

but
this
one
i
will

anything
positive
about
atwater
sugar

and
caramel
malt
smooth
and
drinkable
with
no
evidence
of
the
higher

i
can
see
myself
buying
this
again
and
would

to

5got
this
one
a
little
late
even
before
i
poured
the
beer
it
was
starting
to
foam
out
of
the
bottle
when
i
poured
it
out
came
a
nice
dark
head
and
kept
quite
nicely
nice
dark
ruby
color
to
it
it
smelled
a
little
skunky
and
slightly
smoked
it
tasted
quite
like
it
smelled
you
couled
tast
a
little
licorice
it
it
also
its
mouthfeel
was
a
smooth
but
almost
hard
water
taste
to
it
raisin
but
not
quite
the
bock
i
prefer
this
will
do
when
food
or
company
is
the
focus
and
you
want
a
decent
beer

good

just
a

more
mild
in
taste
and
smell
than
i
would
expect

along
with
bready

a

boozy
aroma
is
pale

and
hints
of

the

a

hint

in
the
finish
i
went
with
a
heavy
hand
on
my
pour
and
although
it
was
not
really
my
intent
i
got
a
pseudocascade
all
the
same
settling
i
was
left
with
a
massive
thereplus
fingers
of
dense
creamy
tawny
head
with
great
retention

a
deepamber
bordering
on
copper
srm
17

with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
rich
and
malty
kind
of
caramel
very
sweet
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
the
taste
was
very
much
like
liquid
caramel
wow
i
usually
disdain
sweet
beers
but
such
the
style
for
this
beer
plus
it
was
not
cloying
that
is
to
say
there
was
the
inherent
sweetness
but
it
did
not
linger
like
a
more
syrupy
beer
might
instead
the
finish
evinced
an
alcohol
heat
which
rendered
it
semidry
as
a
whole
not
bad
and
at
the
price
point
worth
at
least
a
try
overall
just
couldnt
find
anything
over
a
3
in
the
rating
category
here
but
ill
still
finish
the
six
pack
rjt
baby
got
bock
is
a
real
nice
name
the
label
is
creative
and
inviting
it
looks
okay
and
there
was
nothing
on
the
nose
to
indicate
the
assault
i
was
about
to
be
the
subject
of
i
took
a
sip
and
said
not
bad
woah
what
the
heck
was
that
i
winced
with
a
strong
strange
tart
sour
flavor
surely
i
had
been
mistaken
so
i
took
another
halfounce
swallow
i
was
not
mistaken
my
throat
muscles
tensed
up
i
crinkled
my
nose
and
my
head
shook
i
promptly
took
the
ale
glass
to
the
powder
room
sink
and
poured
it
down
without
reservations
in
conclusion
this
offering
from
horny
goat
satisfies
just
as
well
as
the
others
i
have
sampled
sorry
to
say
as
i
really
dislike
being
negative
but
truthfulness
reigns
the
aftertaste
is
also
quite
good
overall
this
exceeds
expectations
and
if
i
were
looking
for
a
good
bock
to
read
this
would
be
a
recommended
author
overall
feels
like
it
falls
a
little
short
of
the
goal
best
part
is
the
brewery
and
name
no
hint
of
abv
on
bottle
or
in
the
sampling
a
decent
brew
that
is
sweet
but
not
cloying
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
big
improvement
over
last
years
batch
of
baby
got
bock
i
live
near
milwaukee
and
talked
to
the
brewmaster
who
said
they
reformulated
this
beer
havent
had
it
on
draft
yet
but
i
will
definitely
look
for
it
drinkability
is
very
nice
on
this
beer
a
normally
do
not
like
bocks
very
much
at
all
horny
goats
offering
has
very
strong
tastes
to
it
and
a
lot
going
on
i
really
like
this
offering
and
would
definitely
seek
out
this
one
again
d
why
overall
not
an
overly
exciting
bock
but
it
hits
the
spot
when
you
want
a
malty
beer
o
this
is
not
the
best
bock
youll
ever
have
but
its
not
bad
i
would
buy
another
sixer
clear
darkergold
colored
brew
fair
amount
of
rising
carb
bubbles
small
but
durable
white
head
scent
is
mainly
sweet
lagered
malts
just
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
alright
im
getting
some
greenbottle
notes
from
it
however
focus
is
on
the
malt
some
grass
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
pretty
soft
mouth
medium
to
full
overall
not
bad
but
whether
its
intentional
or
not
the
greenbottle
taste
and
its
not
sold
in
a
green
bottle
but
you
know
what
im
talking
about
takes
it
down
a
notch
o
a
good
bock
drinkable
and
seems
pretty
true
to
the
style
unclear
what
its
age
might
have
done
for
or
against
it
my
guess
would
be
not
much
the
taste
tends
to
favor
the
nutty
side
more
than
the
malty
side
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
full
of
nutty
vanilla
and
toffee
aromas
it
pours
a
deep
cloudy
amber
color
with
minimal
head
that
dissipates
quickly
medium
sweetness
up
front
and
a
lightly
bitter
finish
it
has
medium
body
a
thin
feel
and
soft
carbonation
it
is
kind
of
weird
to
be
drinking
a
vermont
christmas
beer
in
hawaii
during
february
but
it
paired
well
with
some
sharp
vermont
cheddar
and
definitely
hit
the
spot
o
nothing
unusual
given
the
style
nice
fragrance
and
flavors
smooth
as
well
but
im
not
blown
away
overall
meh
nice
dark
brown
toasty
malts
and
reddish
copper
malts
lots
of
sweeteners
that
arent
too
bad
caramel
molasses
toffee
brown
sugar
etc
light
earthy
bitterness
but
overall
just
seems
a
bit
lackluster
not
enough
carbonation
a
bit
too
sweet
etc
o
a
bit
of
a
letdown
from
the
awesome
nose
thinner
than
id
expect
from
a
bock
and
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
have
liked
a
dark
dark
mohogany
colored
brew
with
a
fair
tan
head
that
almost
instantly
disappears
completely
with
no
lacing
the
nose
picks
up
light
licorice
malt
with
roasted
coffee
beans
very
definite
and
likeable
the
flavor
brings
an
extra
spruce
hop
edge
over
more
coffee
bitterness
its
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
chalkiness
over
an
otherwise
aqueous
brew
with
very
fine
carbonation
this
was
frankly
a
shocker
because
of
the
holiday
label
and
such
an
unholiday
brew
its
a
very
solid
bock
but
i
have
to
say
this
was
a
poor
choice
of
label
overall
i
think
rock
art
should
chill
on
the
claims
they
make
about
their
beers
they
hype
them
up
so
much
on
the
bottles
and
then
dont
really
deliver
with
the
actual
product
ie
this
beer
was
ot
rich
or
creamy
ive
had
3
or
4
of
their
beers
now
all
totally
different
styles
and
i
feel
this
way
about
each
of
them
not
an
awful
beer
in
general
but
definitely
not
what
i
was
lead
to
believe
itd
be
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
more
than
average
on
most
aspects
this
is
definitely
a
once
a
year
drink
only
thanks
to
drewshal9
for
this
one
overall
not
a
terrible
brew
about
or
slightly
above
average
for
a
bock
i
would
take
it
or
leave
it
with
this
beer
i
wont
be
seeking
this
again
but
if
this
was
all
they
had
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
when
i
think
mountain
holidays
in
vermont
my
gut
reaction
is
there
is
too
much
fing
snow
for
me
to
drive
up
to
vermont
despite
this
association

release
some

notes
some
earthy
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
well
from
the

interesting
and
pleasant
throughout
some
lighter
vanilla
and
dark
fruits
emerge
as
it
warms

not
in

fairly
light

should
be
a

thicker
for

probably
would
not
buy
again
they
have
better
offerings
overall
not
a
bad
bock
nice
flavors
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
very
drinkable
overall
being
a
little
snobby
about
my
beer
i
had
pretty
low
expectations
for
this
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
a
solid
easy
drinking
bock
the
growler
is
a
nice
size
to
share
with
some
friends
and
enjoy
a
very
good
beer
nothing
elite
but
is
still
very
enjoyable
overall
bock
is
not
a
style
i
drink
a
lot
but
this
was
surprisingly
one
of
the
tastier
versions
i
have
had
in
some
time
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
smooth
and
not
overly
complex
this
one
was
the
perfect
pizza
beer
for
me
i
would
get
this
againand
maybe
a
couple
of
glasses
at
that
this
a
a
very
drinkable
bock
damn
good
go
try
it
for
yourself
overall
a
different
take
on
the
style
and
an
ok
beer
but
sweeter
than
i
like
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
but
would
not
buy
in
bottles
o
this
is
a
lot
sweeter
than
most
bocks
that
i
have
tried
it
goes
down
smooth
enough
but
it
just
seems
off
o
this
just
isnt
a
very
good
beer
this
is
what
scares
me
about
american
made
bock
beers
i
got
as
part
of
a
botmc
dark
brown
pour
with
a
2
white
head
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
bready
caramel
it
is
on
the
sweeter
side
some
carael
malts
lingering
sweet
finish
the
body
is
light
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
a
decent
easy
drinking
brew
o
this
is
an
okay
bock
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
b
to
c
overall
not
an
terribly
strong
bock
by
any
means
but
it
is
malt
centric
somewhat
refreshing
it

a
decent

sampler
at

with

faded

with
not

was

was
mildly

a

and
some

light

okay
not

overall
its
a
great
sweet

beer
i
enjoy
this
and
will
definitely
buy
it
again
i
bought
it
in
a
mix
and
match
6
pack
at
hyvee
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
like
porters
or
stouts
o
it
has
the
right
flavor
profile
for
me
but
the
body
just
isnt
there
as
such
its
barely
passable
for
me
o
not
the
worst
bock
ive
had
but
certainly
nowhere
near
the
benchmark
for
the
style
either
ive
had
this
brew
on
tap
at
the
pub
and
much
preferred
it
that
way
perhaps
it
is
better
when
a
bit
fresher
i
did
not
like
the
gc
bock
i
thought
it
was
way
to
malty
and
grainy
the
beer
poured
very
dark
red
with
thin
white
head
that
did
not
lace
all
that
great
the
smell
was
big
on
grain
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
to
much
malt
and
barley
with
slight
sweetness
the
beer
had
mediyum
body
not
great
carbonation
overall
not
a
great
beer
most
is
probably
drank
in
the
two
pull
variety
not
bad
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
finish
earthy
and
caramel
notes
linger
o
horrible
beer
imo
the
only
good
thing
is
the
appearance
d
drank
the
entire
growler
in
a
couple
of
sittings
but
was
more
of
a
chore
rather
than
a
motivation
i
wont
actively
seek
out
again
lighter
body
with
good
carbonation
goes
down
easy
but
be
in
the
mood
for
a
maltier
brew

ibus
just
fyi
the
brother
benedicts
bock
was
a
great
beer
it
is
very
dark
reddish
brown
it
has
thick
foamy
head
that
lingers
for
a
short
time
the
taste
is
very
malty
and
rich
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
similar
to
a
stout
i
would
say
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
ive
been
impressed
with
the
beer
that
granite
city
has
to
offer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
23
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
yeast
pale
malt
and
slight
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
bock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
yeast
slight
hop
and
slight
grain
overall
weak
in
body

but
again
a
great

95
for
a
20
oz
this
one
comes
poured
with
about
a
one
finger
head
the
head
quickly
fades
after
a
sip
or
two
the
malt
is
the
overwhelmingly
strong
scent
in
this
brew
a
hint
of
chocolate
also
touches
the
nose
the
taste
is
nothing
exceptional
either
the
malts
taste
burned
and
the
chocolate
also
is
there
much
like
the
smell
in
just
a
hinted
version
i
get
maybe
a
dash
of
hops
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
feels
light
its
almost
as
if
its
a
thin
bock
i
couldnt
drink
any
more
than
one
of
these
and
wouldnt
drink
it
again
especially
for
the
price
notes
this
was
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
the
brewpub
chain
granite
city
id
say
this
at
least
met
my
expectations
which
werent
enormously
high
the
slight
deceit
of
calling
granite
city
a
brewpub
may
irk
some
ill
admit
it
does
me
but
i
cant
disparage
this
decent
bock
d
this
is
a
very
everyone
friendly
beer
nothing
stands
out
in
this
one
to
make
it
a
great
beer
almost
reminds
me
of
a
sweeter
amber
bock
didnt
mind
it
but
was
expecting
a
little
more
dark
brown
with
no
signs
of
carbonation
no
head
at
all
aroma
of
roasted
malts
no
hops
flavor
malt
is
very
complex
with
suddle
roasted
notes
slight
tangyness
aftertatse
no
hops
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
balance
is
ok
but
is
missing
something
but
unsure
of
what
no
head
at
all
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
poor
bown
with
no
presence
of
alcohol
i
feel
this
beer
could
be
good
but
needs
more
work
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
even
a
little
flat
it
goes
down
very
quickly
not
horrible
but
nothing
worth
going
back
for
so
i
guess
i
have
a
15
growler
for
the
shelf
d
really
good
mostly
because
of
the
things
mentioned
above
very
clear
lightmedium
brown
red
highlights
with
light
coming
through
flimsy
white
head
fades
fast
just
a
faint
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
nonexistent
at
first
as
it
was
very
cold
as
it
warmed
some
grainy
chocolate
malt
aroma
faint
esters
with
a
swirl
takes
alot
of
warming
and
work
to
find
anything
taste
follows
nose
grainy
vaguely
roasty
faint
hints
of
both
sweetness
and
bitterness
feel
moderate
carbonation
thin
body
just
a
touch
of
texture
drinks
pretty
easily
due
to
thinness
of
body
the
best
one
of
the
four
they
had
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
if
you
are
there
for
dinner
itll
do
d
at
under
6
this
beer
is
a
great
quaffer
idve
happily
had
a
few
more
pints
had
this
on
tap
at
the
gc
food
and
brewery
i
was
told
it
was
brewed
on
premises
there
in
kansas
city
it
was
a
very
good
crisp
bock
beer
dark
in
color
light
shined
barely
through
the
opaque
nice
rich
aroma
good
taste
that
was
crisp
and
fresh
excellent
lacing
down
the
glass
if
you
are
in
the
area
give
this
place
a
try
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
accompanies
the
food
nicely
d
i
almost
never
say
a
beer
is
too
sweet
but
this
one
didnt
seem
balanced
sweet
and
watery
with
a
very
slight
malt
d
a
solid
bock
2
people
finished
the
2
l
jug
in
a
little
over
an
hour
drinkability
tasty
yet
really
seems
to
be
trying
to
be
inoffensive
they
did
not
take
many
chances
with
this
brew
i
was
really
surprised
by
how
much
i
liked
this
beer
the
transparent
mahogany
body
was
a
touch
thin
and
watery
looking
but
the
head
was
creamy
and
pretty
for
a
minute
or
so
before
it
dissolved
to
nothing
i
took
in
a
heavy
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
just
a
slight
touch
of
alcohol
sweetness
the
taste
is
surprisingly
robust
considering
the
watery
appearance
and
to
a
lesser
degree
mouthfeel
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
sweetness
as
one
would
expect
for
the
style
but
with
a
nice
light
touch
of
hops
minute
carbonation
plays
with
the
tongue
flavors
of
cocoa
caramel
and
leafy
hops
are
all
light
and
nice
very
drinkable
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
beer
mostly
because
of
the
low
expectations
i
had
for
it
but
impressed
nonetheless
a
clear
very
deep
brown
mahogany
body
is
capped
by
a
creamy
head
of
offwhite
foam
the
head
dissipates
shortly
but
that
seems
to
be
fairly
common
for
the
style
lacing
is
limited
to
spots
and
splashes
left
here
and
there
the
nose
is
clean
and
expresses
darkly
caramelish
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
hoppiness
in
the
background
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
creamy
with
a
finebubbled
moderate
carbonation
the
flavor
is
straightforward
darkly
caramelish
and
lightly
toasty
malt
with
a
thread
of
leafy
hops
and
the
suggestion
of
alcohol
although
it
never
really
shows
itself
very
nicely
done
fullflavored
and
perfectly
balanced
perhaps
the
best
bock
ive
ever
had
at
a
brewpub
overall
enjoyable
just
a
little
below
the
ipa
in
the
overall
marking
stakes
but
a
good
effort
that
i
had
little
trouble
with
i
think
it
exhibited
more
english
brown
ale
tones
than
the
bock
moniker
would
have
you
believe
though

not
that
that
is
a
complaint
from
me
i
have
to
say
d
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
granite
city
but
it
could
be
hit
or
miss
according
to
the
batch
it
came
from
if
you
have
a
chance
give
this
one
a
try
and
i
doubt
youll
be
disappointed
p
s
this
beer
was
served
waaaay
too
cold
in
a
chilled
glass
had
a
pint
over
lunch
at
the
quasibrewpub
brown
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
and
touch
of
lacing
not
bad
but
it
could
look
better
smell
and
taste
are
heavy
on
the
chocolate
and
not
much
else
theres
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
licorice
but
its
mostly
chocolate
simple
taste
but
the
a
lack
of
offflavors
still
make
it
a
satisfying
drink
the
so
called
mai
bock
as
a
beer
was
a
little
watered
down
as
well
the
yeast
was
nothing
exciting
and
difficult
to
pick
up
the
yeast
overall
i
was
not
impressed
and
more
confused
on
this
beer
maybe
add
more
english
malts
and
fuller
body
and
you
have
a
decent
english
brown
ale
tasted
ontap
051105
at
the
cedar
rapids
ia
location
i
am
listing
this
as
a
bock
because
it
shows
none
of
the
characteristics
of
a
maibock
dark
brown
color
looks
much
more
like
a
bock
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
very
tame
and
slightly
chocolatey
like
a
bock
taste
does
not
have
the
alcohol
presence
rich
maltiness
or
the
spiciness
of
a
maibock
mouthfeel
was
carbonated
ok
but
not
that
impressive
good
drinakability
but
not
very
unique
drinkability
as
stated
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
pairs
well
with
many
of
the
foods
served
as
it
is
mellow
without
any
strong
flavor
characteristics
standing
out
i
tasted
this
beer
on
tap
and
the
cedar
rapids
location
overall
this
bock
has
a
fulland
complete
taste
not
the
best
bock
in
the
world
but
a
rich
malty
roasted
flavor
can
be
tasted
along
with
a
nice
sweet
yeast
flavor
the
dark
color
makes
this
a
very
attractive
beer
consumed
at
the
west
des
moines
location
really
a
nice
tasting
bock
doesnt
fit
the
maibock
profile
but
whatever
i
like
the
flavor
a
lot
they
should
call
it
a
bock
though
brother
benedict
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
quickly
a
medium
body
with
the
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
somewhat
light
toast
feel
left
on
the
palate
my
personal
granite
city
favorite
can
drink
this
one
anytime
a
rather
tasty
brew
this
beer
comes
out
with
bright
red
color
and
small
head
the
body
is
relatively
light
and
the
finish
clean
which
compliments
the
bready
biscuity
flavors
of
the
brew
pretty
good
not
a
fan
of
bock
beers
not
bad
bit
not
sure
if
i
would
get
it
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
very
unique
too
it
has
nice
malt
and
sweetness
flavors
blended
well
with
some
very
interesting
sauerbratenlike
vinegary
notes
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
it
and
id
certainly
have
it
again
12
oz
bottle

light
brown
with
tall
long
lasting
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
grassy
hops
and
some
cherries
body
is
medium
and
slightly
crisp
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
herbal
hops
and
some
dark
fruit
well
balanced
finish
is
long
semidry
exceeded
my
expectations
a
very
good
bock
smooth
deep
and
rich
flavor
from
what
i
can
remember
from
having
this
beer
it
was
ok
it
was
not
my
favorite
beer
but
the
taste
was
not
all
that
bad
for
a
cheaper
beer
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
myself
i
liked
it
but
i
like
bock
beer
this
was
not
my
favorite
back
beer
but
it
was
a
decent
beer
thank
you
yuengling
brewery
a
soso
bock
it
lacks
eyeappeal
with
its
weak
head
the
taste
is
decent
enough
yet
ultimately
underwhelming
with
a
lack
of
depth
and
complexity
for
the
style
overall
a
modest
3
25
is
given
to
this
seasonal
bock
brew
from
yuengling
this
is
certainly
a
sipper
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
to
compliment
a
heartier
meal
overall
this
is
a
decent
bock
however
it
does
not
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
a
little
more
flavor
would
be
nice
but
this
is
not
bad
as
long
as
you
can
find
it
cheap
if
there
was
a
light
bock
out
there
that
hit
at
simplicity
and
easy
drinking
this
is
it
i
hope
that
the
goat
is
right
my
pour
got
me
a
finger
of
fizzy
lighttan
head
that
quickly
dropped
out
of
existence
color
was
a
colabrown
srm
22
27
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
sugary
malty
sweetness
and
i
was
reminded
why
i
may
not
have
reviewed
this
previously
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
thin
and
watery
and
the
taste
was
actually
not
as
sweet
i
had
girded
myself
to
expect
instead
it
had
a
slightly
grassy
hoppiness
that
helped
to
offset
the
malt
finish
was
semisweet
but
kind
of
bland
for
the
style
i
would
be
willing
to
try
it
again
if
they
can
it
but
as
long
as
it
is
bottleonly
it
will
remain
a
real
oneanddone
for
me
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
am
glad
i
had
it
first
had
it
from
the
tap
which
was
much
better
than
the
bottle
i
gave
the
bock
of
the
last
two
years
a
medium
to
low
rating
majorily
due
to
the
fact
that
yuengling
has
given
way
to
the
pressure
to
release
their
beer
all
too
soon
in
years
gone
by
the
bock
wasnt
released
until
march
and
ran
through
june
normal
bock
release
time
typically
a
bock
is
created
at
the
end
of
winter
and
cellared
until
the
first
thaw
this
gives
it
the
distinct
flavors
and
causes
it
to
mature
through
age
the
bock
of
old
would
release
in
the
spring
and
the
taste
would
evolve
throughout
the
relaese
when
yuengling
releases
the
bock
it
is
not
ready
for
consumation
and
it
will
have
a
very
strong
taste
both
hoppy
and
roasted
in
taste
in
my
experience
the
beer
will
maturate
over
a
period
of
months
each
month
mellowing
in
flavor
and
revealing
more
complexities
of
the
original
mash
tun
although
i
dont
agree
with
what
dick
is
doing
with
the
release
date
of
his
bock
i
have
put
a
few
6packs
on
the
shelf
for
say
april
and
may
they
will
definately
have
a
different
taste
by
then
i
love
the
idea
of
throwback
bocks
and
i
understand
that
this
beer
has
been
around
for
a
little
while
but
this
was
the
first
time
id
seen
it
in
a
local
store
its
a
very
clear
chestnut
colored
brew
moderately
low
in
carbonation
with
a
thin
whitish
head
the
smell
is
of
an
adjunct
lager
mixed
with
some
pleasant
lightly
toasted
malt
identity
crisis
the
taste
is
sweet
with
some
malt
backbone
some
macro
cornlike
flavors
as
well
more
frontline
bitterness
than
expected
too
medium
in
body
more
than
expected
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
isnt
bad
either
like
i
said
i
am
a
fan
of
throwback
brews
heavy
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
yet
easily
drinkable
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
that
aspect
gets
a
win
for
me
midbrown
color
leaves
a
thin
head
almost
no
tracing
i
get
an
earthy
taste
from
this
some
hints
of
wood
as
well
this
beer
definitely
strong
arms
the
pallet
cleanse
before
trying
anything
else
it
sure
will
muddle
it
ill
stick
to
the
rules
and
not
say
which
bocks
i
had
that
were
better
many
were
but
for
the
price
this
one
is
acceptable
o
flat
simple
thin
disappointing
to
call
this
a
bock
is
like
calling
a
pilsner
an
ipa
only
backwards
it
is
the
worst
example
of
a
bock
i
have
ever
tasted
it
is
twice
as
bitter
and
half
as
malty
i
am
thankful
i
only
wasted
money
on
a
6pack
someone
should
really
educate
them
on
the
bock
style
yuengling
makes
a
good
lager
but
as
far
as
a
bock
it
would
not
even
be
suitable
for
marinade
in
closing
i
would
just
like
to
addi
think
this
beer
gets
a
bit
too
much
negative
press
from
people
comparing
it
to
othermore
traditional
bocksa
lot
of
them
costing
least
twice
as
muchi
can
pick
up
yuengling
bock
up
all
day
long
for
around
6
50
a
6erthat
is
a
very
sweet
price
point
for
a
goodsmooth
drinking
beer
of
any
typelet
alone
a
bockand
personally
i
just
enjoy
this
beer
a
lot
do
not
think
it
deserves
the
amount
of
hate
it
getsbut
thats
just
my
opinion
manso
hate
it
if
you
want
tobut
me
i
am
gonna
drink
the
hell
out
of
it
hehecheers
o
a
drinkable
bock
not
enough
distinctive
taste
to
get
especially
excited
about
but
a
good
solid
pleasing
beer
with
nothing
to
dislike
about
it
have
had
two
and
the
second
was
consistent
with
the
first
this
was
my
first
bock
experience
and
is
was
a
good
one
i
must
say
i
do
like
and
what
i
understand
they
just
started
brewing
again
after
a
long
hiatus
reddish
color
and
very
hoppy
and
carmel
taste
it
is
now
i
guess
a
seasonal
brew
for
them
and
lets
hope
they
continue
brew
for
all
to
taste
i
am
very
satisfied
with
this
attempt
by
yuengling
it
gets
a
little
old
when
you
grew
up
around
yuengling
lager
and
constantly
hear
everyone
boast
about
it
they
have
a
nice
niche
note
this
is
a
lager
i
praise
yuengling
for
marketing
this
attempt
that
said
is
it
a
world
class
bock
hell
no
did
i
enjoy
it
hell
yes
for
the
price
and
taste
i
would
gladly
buy
this
every
time
over
regular
yuengling
lager
that
is
if
they
keep
making
it
cheers
to
yueng
for
trying
something
different
or
at
least
a
little
different
and
of
course
cheers
to
you
mateys
overall
impression
a
very
approachable
beer
provides
much
more
flavor
than
the
typical
industrialcommercial
offerings
it
will
appeal
to
the
masses
but
probably
wont
do
much
for
any
extreme
beer
enthusiasts
the
product
is
nicely
done
and
for
the
price
point
ill
be
bock
would
be
good
with
sushi
im
thinking
and
burgers
and
mexican
fare
your
mileage
may
vary
on
food
pairings
of
course
rather
boilerplatebut
solidexample
of
the
style
pours
a
limp
and
nearly
headless
brown
with
an
aroma
of
grass
and
sugar
dusted
caramel
tastes
sweet
and
crisp
with
mild
and
zippy
nodes
of
fruit
biscuits
and
sugar
against
a
pleasantly
fleeting
backend
of
grass
and
mild
hops
eh
ill
be
honest
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
nothing
too
good
just
a
malty
yuengling
o
good
bock
especially
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
slightly
hoppy
flavor
my
only
wish
is
that
it
would
have
a
more
substantial
fell
in
the
mouth
notes
this
is
horrible
beer
mean
looking
wretched
smelling
and
awful
tasting
i
couldnt
finish
it
and
am
now
stuck
with
5
more
bottles
there
are
two
predominant
characteristics
of
beer
flavor
hops
and
malt
some
palates
prefer
one
of
these
i
prefer
a
balance
of
the
two
as
is
found
in
the
beers
from
germany
this
bock
is
an
example
of
a
typical
american
style
of
bock
where
the
hops
predominate
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
in
the
background
fine
if
you
prefer
this
style
a
tragedy
if
you
do
not
i
prefer
a
more
balanced
brew
decided
to
try
this
kind
of
been
on
a
bockdouble
bock
kick
lately
felt
it
was
smoother
than
conventional
yuengling
lager
with
a
more
refined
taste
decent
reddishumber
colour
smelled
faint
notes
of
caramel
left
little
to
no
head
came
from
tap
and
what
little
head
was
there
quickly
dissipated
taste
was
conventional
bock
without
being
too
dry
all
told
a
pleasing
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
the
appearance
is
a
darker
then
amber
brown
with
a
light
head
grainy
aroma
a
bit
of
hop
presents
but
this
is
malt
centered
with
a
sweet
and
caramel
taste
more
carbination
then
expected
the
price
and
the
ease
of
drinking
make
it
worth
a
try
i
will
take
my
bock
exploration
elsewhere
overall
this
one
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
which
isnt
actually
saying
much
since
its
very
cheap
first
of
their
seasonals
that
i
felt
was
noticeably
better
than
the
lager
a
brisk
pour
into
a
german
dimple
mug
kicks
up
a
brief
rocky
head
of
light
tan
foam
that
settled
with
large
soaplike
bubbles
that
collapses
into
a
14
collar
nice
dark
tea
color
with
healthy
carbonation
sweet
bready
malts
and
a
lingering
subtle
roastiness
very
light
hop
aroma
nice
dark
bread
bittersweet
flavor
more
bitter
from
the
dark
malts
rather
than
hops
a
fruity
note
remains
after
taking
a
mouth
filling
sip
decent
but
thin
mouthfeel
and
prickly
carbonation
finishes
up

nice
showing
from

but
some
more

backbone
would
elevate
this
to
a
truly
high
quality
bock
good
session
brew
nonetheless
o
overall
a
decent
beer
from
the
brewers
at
yuengling
thanks
and
keep
up
the
good
work
also
would
work
in
a
marinade
or
stewpot
of
chili
o
overall
it
can
hardly
compare
to
an
salvator
or
other
notable
bock
seems
to
be
a
tweener
and
more
of
an
introductory
to
the
yuengling
crowd
or
macro

to
the
world
of
bocks
low

lack
of

pours

leaves
a

roasted

with

of
coffee
but
not
strong
tastes
of
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
but
otherwise
not
many
other
tones
jump
out
this
medium
bodied
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
overall
an
average
beer
id
have
to
favor
the
porter
flat
out
as
for
bock
ill
stick
with
ze
germans
its
not
bad
for
pa
though
drinkability
is
good
tasty
bock
full
flavor
but
light
and
balanced
enough
to
enjoy
on
a
brisk
spring
day
working
the
yard
or
in
my
case
after
decent
for
domestic
bock
id
have
this
again
i
like
it
better
than
the
lager
from
yuengling
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
chesterfield
but
close
nice
surprise
beer
overall
pretty
easy
drinking
but
still
lingers
in
flavor
pretty
close
to
lager
except
for
some
mild
caramel
malt
tones
ill
take
this
over
lager
but
would
like
to
see
a
version
with
a
hop
presence
to
chesterfield
well
guess
this
is
going
to
be
interesting
pour
is
deep
amber
but
still
translucent
tight
white
head
with
small
bubbles
the
smell
is
candied
and
burnt
sugar
with
touches
of
caramel
it
starts
out
nice
and
light
cereal
grains
dominate
at
the
beginning
but
it
finishes
overly
sticky
sweet
with
burnt
sugars
really
dominating
to
a
sickening
thing
it
was
like
eating
brown
sugar
near
the
end
decent
for
the
price
but
probably
not
something
id
seek
out
again
overy
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
obviously
it
has
more
of
an
adjunct
taste
to
it
than
other
good
bocks
but
its
definitely
a
fun
beer
to
drink
i
could
order
this
by
the
pitcher
vikings
verdict
yuenglings
bock
doesnt
offer
enough
for
me
to
keep
coming
back
to
everything
taste
smell
is
pretty
much
mediocre
and
its
real
saving
grace
will
be
its
lower
price
overall
this
might
not
be
the
perfect
example
of
a
bock
but
it
has
good
flavor
and
is
quite
refreshing
one
of
the
better
values
out
there

sweet

metallic
finish
taste
did
not
match
the
looks
or
smell
of
this
beer
many
better
bock
beers
out
there
this
isnt
a
bad
bock
by
any
means
taste
wise
it
feels
and
tastes
like
a
yuengling
it
has
that
dry
light
feel
with
a
not
so
sweet
bock
taste
that
i
am
accustomed
to
in
european
bocks
it
tastes
much
more
like
their
black
tan
it
lacked
the
real
roastiness
of
the
finer
bocks
and
lacked
some
spicing
id
say
with
time
this
one
will
sort
itself
out
this
has
good
balance
and
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
ultimately
it
doesnt
have
as
much
flavor
or
complexity
as
some
other
bocks
out
there
overall
similar
to
their
lager

reviewer
donmonkey1
was
spot
on
in
his
review
this
beer
is
easy
to
enjoy
although
thirst
quenching
it
has
nice
and
assertive
character
review
from
notes
so
there
i
am
in
the
store
with
a
12
of
genesee
bock
beer
under
my
arm
looking
for
something
else
at
the
top
of
the
food
chain
when
i
see
yuenglings
bock
beer
in
a
sixer
what
in
ohio
before
their
porter
i
took
a
flier
on
it
give
gennys
lil
goat
a
run
for
the
pepsi
challenge
style
fight
between
the
two
poured
a
dark
amber
with
little
head
into
dimpled
mug
smells
of
malt
and
hops
slightly
bitter
taste
from
the
hops
in
the
front
that
is
quickly
evened
and
sweetened
up
by
the
maltiness
and
then
finishes
rather
cleanly
with
good
mix
of
hop
malt
and
carbonation
much
like
genny
a
good
bock
thats
reasonably
priced
though
this
has
a
bit
of
hop
presence
to
it
much
like
their
black
tan
this
too
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
mix
of
their
lager
with
its
mild
malt
and
the
slight
hop
bite
of
their
lord
chesterfield
ale
overall
very
good
for
a
decent
price
as
far
as
bock
goes
i
am
not
sure
if
i
am
drinking
a
bad
bock
or
a
bad
yuengling
lager
not
good
the
goat
this
is
it
outside
of
the
inventive
labeling
there
is
nothing
good
going
on
here
i
am
actually
very
surprised
they
rolled
this
out
as
the
first
seasonal
in
ohio
i
would
not
want
to
buy
another
seasonal
if
i
did
not
have
a
general
respect
for
yuengling
as
is
i
will
chalk
this
one
up
as
a
bad
taste
in
an
otherwise
good
brand
sadly
a
direct
competitor
to
mgd
overall
for
the
price
yuengling
comes
though
again
while
not
the
best
bock
you
will
have
they
make
a
pretty
decent
brew
at
a
good
price
bottle
no
idea
where
or
when
i
acquired
this
gem
pours
a
clear
medium
colored
copper
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
light
tan
head
vegetable
mixed
with
caramel
nose
medium
mouthfeel
the
vegetable
i
smell
and
taste
is
tomato
i
sorta
has
a
stewed
tomato
taste
weird
the
aroma
and
taste
are
not
good
but
the
look
is
awesome
great
lacing
and
head
retention
just
too
bad
the
rest
of
this
didnt
come
together
not
a
bad
beer
tastes
pretty
similar
to
yuenglings
other
offerings
smooth
and
refreshing
in
my
honest
opinion
it
tastes
identical
to
black
and
tan
maybe
with
a
few
little
differences
it
is
definetely
a
refreshing
beer
and
could
possibly
work
as
a
session
drinker
if
i
wasnt
born
and
raised
a
pa
coal
crack
i
would
probably
not
even
review
yuengling
but
since
i
grew
up
with
these
guys
i
have
no
other
choice
than
to
let
me
pride
show
taste
is
malty
and
nutty
sim
at
to
the
smell
finishes
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
good
and
well
balanced
overall
a
decent
brew
nothing
outstanding
but
its
solid
poured
into
my
pilsner
glass
resulting
in
a
good
two
finger
head
of
dense
foam
and
wonderful
clinging
lace
some
of
the
best
lace
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
the
color
is
a
29
in
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
that
of
roasted
barley
burnt
corn
husks
peat
moss
rich
coca
and
dark
brewed
coffee
the
initial
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
lingering
of
honey
rich
roasted
barley
follows
and
the
finish
is
a
tinge
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
grand
and
full
lots
of
creamy
coating
and
fullness
overall
it
is
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
and
drink
while
watching
a
good
movie
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
very
drinkable
but
rather
plain
session
beers
dont
get
much
more
obvious
than
this
theres
a
mild
roasted
presence
to
this
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
but
like
the
flagship
beer
in
this
brewers
lineup
this
is
mediocre
at
best
only
seek
this
out
if
youre
desperate
for
a
bock
and
its
not
the
sign
of
the
goat
on
your
astrological
calender
this
is
like
a
malt
liquor
this
is
yet
another
yuengling
offering
i
wouldnt
seek
out
again
but
wouldnt
decline
of
offered
an
easy
drinking
bock
thats
well
balanced
overall
the
one
yuengling
i
will
never
again
try
unless
convinced
other
wise
reddish
brown
beer
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
earthy
aroma
with
some
burnt
grassy
notes
nice
citrus
hop
flavor
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
followed
by
roasted
coffee
and
sweet
breadiness
aftertaste
of
sweet
caramel
feels
a
little
watery
but
overall
a
pleasant
drink
drinkability
mild
carbonation
a
touch
gritty
in
the
mouth
very
mild
clean
tasting
bock
with
grainy
sweet
flavors
of
of
bread
and
toast
and
an
appropriate
amount
of
hop
bitterness
not
much
hops
beyond
bittering
a
little
thin
in
body
and
weak
in
alcohol
for
the
style
but
nice
clean
flavors
of
rich
grains
make
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
pours
a
slightly
muddy
dark
brown
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
diffuses
quickly
aroma
is
standard
some
sweeter
dark
malts
is
really
all
thats
here
doesnt
smell
bad
though
and
it
doesnt
taste
bad
either
this
is
just
a
pretty
simple
bock
that
tastes
pretty
good
its
a
touch
watery
at
the
start
but
comes
through
with
a
roasty
kick
at
the
end
reminds
me
of
an
ampedup
version
of
their
lager
in
taste
profile
actually
nothing
mindblowing
but
perfectly
serviceable
and
cheap
the
mouthfeel
is
decently
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
dryness
to
it
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
overall
a
pretty
good
offering
from
yuengling
thats
quite
cheap
if
this
were
easier
to
find
during
the
distribution
period
i
would
have
bought
a
lot
of
it
but
i
only
just
found
it
at
total
wine
o
very
simple
bock
nothing
to
weird
or
out
of
the
ordinary
overall
highly
disappointing
i
dont
expect
world
class
beer
from
yuengling
but
i
expect
something
decent
especially
considering
i
like
the
porter
and
lager
didnt
expect
something
that
is
reminicent
of
old
wet
cardboard
love
the
packaging
but
im
wondering
if
this
might
have
gone
bad
in
the
short
amount
of
time
it
has
been
on
the
shelves
wish
i
could
have
had
a
single
bottle
instead
of
a
whole
six
pack
might
have
to
try
cooking
with
it
or
something
this
beer
pours
out
of
12
oz
bottle
a
brown
red
color
like
coca
cola
with
a
pure
white
head
which
disappears
rapidly
carbonation
is
minimal
like
a
bock
should
be
so
far
it
looks
like
a
bock
smells
include
munich
malt
sweetness
and
an
earthy
overtone
not
bad
tastes
like
sweet
and
roasted
munich
malts
some
corn
adjunct
and
earthy
hops
so
they
used
a
tettnanger
or
liberty
style
hops
good
job
except
the
corn
overtone
drinkability
is
high
and
this
is
goes
down
easy
for
all
accounts
and
purposes
this
is
the
best
in
what
i
would
call
american
style
bock
it
hearkens
back
to
a
german
beer
with
an
american
twist
this
is
a
good
interpretation
overall
i
have
to
say
pass
on
this
beer
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
of
it
taste
is
blandharsh
and
completely
uneventful
while
some
boring
beers
are
at
least
have
a
place
in
this
world
macro
lager
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
boring
beer
leaves
your
mouth
somewhat
annoyed
o
this
is
a
very
decent
offering
it
seems
better
ontap
than
i
recall
it
being
in
the
bottle
overall
kind
of
what
i
expected
from
this
brewery
i
respect
it
for
its
rich
history
but
not
something
i
would
buy
reminds
me
in
many
ways
of
gennesee
bock
beer
taste
is
lacking
a
bit
some
caramel
malts
come
through
not
a
hint
of
hops
amd
just
the
slightest
hint
of
booze
in
the
finish
the
taste
itself
isnt
actually
so
bad
but
combined
with
an
unpleasant
smell
and
a
weak
but
toohighly
carbonated
mouthfeel
the
taste
and
beer
take
a
hit
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
be
drinking
it
again
anytime
soon
not
sitting
very
well
with
me
this
is
probably
my
favorite
yuengling
release
im
glad
they
brought
it
back
from
retirement
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
was
at
the
outback
steakhouse
and
they
had
advertisements
for
it
on
the
tables
and
it
shocked
me
to
see
that
yuengling
was
taking
part
in
a
seasonal
release
i
ordered
one
right
away
it
came
with
a
nice
tan
head
capping
off
a
smooth
looking
brown
body
the
aroma
of
malts
were
the
strong
point
of
this
brew
its
not
the
best
bock
out
there
but
i
just
thought
it
was
awesome
that
they
put
this
out
to
compete
with
all
the
other
seasonals
out
there
havent
had
a
dunkler
bock
before
and
few
other
bock
styles
but
im
quite
enjoying
this
one
o
very
nice
bock
smooth
not
overpowering
and
just
enjoyable
to
drink
notes
for
me
it
just
misses
the
mark
and
my
overall
feeling
is
that
its
a
very
drinkable
but
average
at
best
bock
first
of
all
love
the
label
on
this
beer
it
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
small
ring
of
white
foam
that
lingers
aroma
is
rather
faint
toasty
caramel
malts
faint
hop
presence
flavor
is
is
a
little
malty
not
too
sweet
as
some
other
bocks
are
and
a
bit
watery
there
is
a
little
hops
bitterness
in
the
everso
quick
finish
actually
kinda
resembles
their
traditional
lager
thin
but
slightly
creamy
and
soft
mouthfeel
still
watery
overall
its
a
little
bit
above
average
think
massproduced
golden
lagers
but
its
far
from
a
bock
the
5
1
abv
excludes
that
right
off
the
bat
with
traditional
bocks
starting
at
6
3
the
lack
of
malt
flavor
then
completely
shuts
it
down
otherwise
theyre
at
least
on
the
right
track
i
like
this
brew
and
for
the
money
it
will
dance
a
refreshing
beer
but
almost
a
light
bock
the
qualities
are
there
however
to
subtle
to
be
a
great
beer
that
being
said
not
a
bad
sixer
for
a
kickback
night
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
yet
it
lacks
the
fuller
body
of
other
beers
in
the
style
despite
the
underwhelming
nosepalate
combo
the
mouthfeel
is
finely
balanced
and
provides
a
crispy
finish
while
yuengling
bock
can
never
compete
with
the
munich
heavyweights
it
is
still
nice
to
see
the
yuenglings
brew
one
nonetheless
i
remember
the
dark
sweet
easter
drink
fromchildhood
chocolate
probably
more
than
i
should
but
i
was
glad
when
i
heard
they
were
bringing
the
bock
back
i
had
it
isnt
as
expensive
and
seems
a
better
choice
hey
overall
good
beer
overall
i
like
yuengling
traditional
lager
from
time
to
time
but
this
is
a
better
beer
from
the
same
brewer
this
could
become
a
goto
cheap
beer
for
me
its
not
world
class
by
any
means
but
its
worth
trying
if
only
because
its
cheap
d
fairly
drinkable
id
choose
it
over
other
brews
from
pottsville
pa
definitely
beats
the
porter
and
the
amber
lager
the
six
i
bought
was
enough
d
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
very
reasonable
abv
is
it
a
fantastic
bock
no
but
i
certainly
wont
have
any
trouble
finishing
the
six
pack
d
sure
its
drinkable
but
there
are
so
many
better
examples
of
bocks
out
there
i
tried
but
could
not
get
excited
about
this
one
got
session
i
ran
across
this
interesting
find
in
my
go
to
beer
store
here
in
md
being
born
and
raised
in
pa
i
was
astonished
to
find
a
yuengling
brew
that
i
had
yet
to
sample
this
was
the
start
and
the
end
of
my
happiness
with
regard
to
this
beer
it
pours
slightly
darker
then
there
traditional
lager
there
is
little
to
no
overpowering
aroma
upon
initial
investigation
i
took
my
first
sip
and
was
immediately
surprised
however
in
an
unpleasant
way
where
is
the
taste
i
was
expecting
something
akin
to
a
doppelbock
but
what
i
got
was
something
much
less
i
feel
that
in
the
world
of
bargain
beer
yuengling
has
shown
through
and
produced
a
fairly
good
lager
entering
this
tasting
with
that
in
mind
was
a
poor
idea
i
feel
that
this
was
a
half
hearted
attempt
at
capturing
the
ever
growing
craft
beer
market
yuengling
family
please
stick
to
what
you
are
good
at
and
not
wonder
off
the
beaten
path
i
am
unfortunately
not
looking
around
anymore
to
find
new
concepts
from
this
brewery
not
a
terrible
beer
for
the
price
but
im
not
overly
impressed
serving
type
bottle
d
very
easy
to
drink
bock
light
for
this
syle
so
it
goes
down
fast
pours
a
nice
moderate
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
a
tan
head
the
nose
brings
a
good
deal
of
caramel
as
well
as
a
bit
of
toffee
and
light
hops
the
taste
is
confined
to
caramel
and
bread
bit
is
still
nice
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
pretty
tasty
and
a
great
value
not
for
me
but
it
is
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
to
be
blown
away
but
i
was
definitely
pleased
with
this
beer
this
is
one
that
i
could
drink
all
night
worth
trying
sometime
a
basic
bock
but
that
is
not
neccesarily
a
bad
thing
brown
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
very
good
retention
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
good
caramel
aroma
but
there
is
some
metallic
coming
in
as
well
caramel
flavor
upfront
followed
by
copper
pennys
a
little
toasted
the
body
is
just
too
thin
no
substance
and
by
far
the
weakest
element
of
this
beer
a
decent
beer
that
i
believe
comes
in
a
very
attractive
price
point
not
the
best
bock
by
far
but
worth
a
try
this
was
an
ok
bock
i
though
it
was
a
bit
too
thin
and
the
citrus
was
a
little
out
of
balance
it
seemed
like
it
was
like
a
lager
with
double
the
malts
and
double
the
citrus
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
americas
oldest
brewery
although
ive
found
their
product
a
bit
lacking
in
quality
over
the
past
10
years
due
to
expansion
this
is
a
solid
bock
not
what
i
was
expecting
d
very
good
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
to
my
mind
one
of
the
best
beers
made
by
yuengling
brewery
recommended
best
beer
yuengling
makes
d
a
lackluster
bock
beer
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
america
i
have
only
had
one
of
these
so
ill
update
if
needed
thanks
justin
once
again
cause
i
really
wanted
to
try
this
beer
out
d
very
good
could
have
a
few
of
them
without
a
problem
d
meh
no
thanks
there
are
so
many
great
bocks
out
there
this
one
is
not
worth
repeating
drank
alright
would
take
this
over
say
a
shiner
bock
but
still
nothing
to
get
worked
up
about
drink
ice
cold
for
better
drinkability
imo
d
very
drinkable
nice
mix
of
the
flavors
and
not
too
high
abv
makes
it
pretty
sessionable
as
well
the
smell
was
very
earthy
and
clean
no
skunk
or
bitterness
tasted
great
again
very
clean
to
the
palate
with
no
real
aftertaste
and
a
little
watery
but
very
tasty
this
beer
was
not
an
in
your
face
beer
very
laid
back
and
different
i
am
not
a
fan
of
yuengling
black
and
tan
and
can
barely
drink
a
yuengling
traditional
its
a
different
change
in
pace
for
a
college
kid
throwing
back
miller
lite
and
keystones
all
the
time
i
am
a
mainstream
macro
kinda
guy
and
this
was
a
delicious
beer
the
mouth
feel
was
again
not
in
your
face
and
the
drink
ability
was
fair
maybe
a
little
heavy
i
think
that
1
or
2
of
these
would
be
good
with
a
nice
dinner
or
calm
night
its
a
good
beer
to
cherish
and
drink
for
taste
i
will
definitely
be
seeing
this
beer
again
in
my
future
and
i
will
recommend
it
to
those
who
want
to
break
out
of
the
macro
league
its
definitely
different
but
a
good
different
if
you
can
get
by
the
mediocre
taste
it
drinks
fine
and
has
a
nice
lighter
mid
body
good
beer
i
liked
it
very
much
i
am
going
to
pick
up
some
more
next
time
i
go
to
the
store
its
just
a
nice
change
a
little
darker
a
little
richer
kind
of
like
a
stronger
yuengling
porter
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
it
it
will
taste
even
better
good
to
see
yuengling
brewing
some
different
stuff
im
not
going
to
go
into
details
but
i
was
quite
surprised
when
i
had
this
beer
its
unbeatable
for
the
price
i
got
it
at
andy
gavins
in

1
50
for
a
pint
or
6
00
for
a
pitcher
unbeatable
price
and
it
tastes
surprisingly
good
continuing
the
bock
minikick
the
celebrator
glass
after
a
nice
rinse
welcomes
the
characteristic
amber
brown
of
the
yuengling
bock
the
sweet
caramel
and
toffeeloaded
nose
also
reaches
par
things
go
downhill
once
the
tongue
insists
on
getting
involved
now
call
me
crazy
but
i
expected
something
akin
to
the
nose
and
every
other
bock
ever
brewed
unfortunately
what
hit
me
was
some
strange
combination
of
leather
and
flat
cola
this
isnt
to
say
that
the
brew
was
flat
indeed
it
was
not
overly
effervescent
but
carried
enough
bubbliness
to
get
by
rather
it
had
the
same
flavor
that
a
flat
cola
would
have
following
about
an
hour
in
the
car
during
some
sunny
july
afternoon
am
i
a
fan
nope
the
rest
of
the
brew
worked
out
fine
a
nice
smooth
feel
with
a
fairly
dry
but
still
somewhat
pleasant
finish
if
only
that
unsatisfactory
taste
hadnt
been
there
overall
a
nice
inexpensive
lager
its
not
watery
but
its
also
not
a
big
malt
or
hop
bomb
almost
a
session
beer
but
just
a
bit
too
strong
drinkability
im
liking
this
beer
as
a
possibility
for
having
again
and
for
entertaining
friends
who
think
they
dont
like
beer
im
looking
forward
to
next
year
and
having
this
again
overall
a
very
nice
beer
nothing
special
perhaps
but
certainly
worth
a
yearly
visit
drinkability
meh
not
bad
flavors
are
alright
doesnt
sit
heavy
and
the
abv
is
certainly
more
than
manageable
but
overall
its
a
pretty
averageatbest
offering
not
bad
tastes
alot
like
a
bigger
version
of
yuengling
lager
not
really
what
i
would
consider
a
great
beer
but
it
is
a
nice
alternative
to
bmc
products
not
bad
at
all
i
can
tell
its
in
the
same
family
as
yuengling
lager
i
like
that
but
it
has
its
own
character
very
drinkable
good
for
sessions
this
small
bock
is
really
nicely
pricedi
think
a
good
value
poured
a
rich
amber
with
a
nice
creamylike
one
finger
head
that
settled
into
a
creamy
mass
mainly
caramel
in
the
noseslight
roast
as
well
flavors
are
caramel
accented
with
some
roasted
nut
notesa
sweetish
bready
malt
flavor
comes
in
as
well
not
badits
modest
but
decent
in
my
mind
md
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
was
looking
forward
to
it
coming
out
this
year
turns
out
it
is
okay
but
really
nothing
special
its
a
good
beer
for
the
price
and
it
really
is
an
easy
drinker
a
nice
beer
from
yuengling
yuengling
americas
oldest
brewery
with
an
old
world
style
bock
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
bottle
top
reveals
a
fresh
malty
smell
with
a
hint
of
black
licorice
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
brew
has
a
dark
root
beer
color
with
a
big
multisized
bubble
head
taste
is
starts
out
slightly
metallic
then
has
a
bitter
maltiness
that
continues
metallic
and
hints
of
black
licorice
come
through
the
beer
has
good
body
and
the
carbonation
is
good
the
flavor
is
spot
on
for
a
bock
the
metallic
taste
drops
the
flavor
rating
a
bit
all
in
all
a
bargain
beer
for
the
price
d
personally
im
a
fan
of
yuenglings
flagship
lager
but
i
dont
feel
that
they
did
as
a
good
a
job
with
the
bock
nice
to
see
them
branching
out
but
i
think
they
missed
the
mark
on
this
beer
ran
across
this
at
the
local
beer
shop
and
had
never
seen
it
before
pours
a
nice
dark
red
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
fades
with
chunky
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
pronounced
toasted
notes
with
some
buttery
undertones
and
a
slightly
sour
smell
in
the
background
could
also
be
described
as
slightly
dishraglike
the
taste
starts
out
a
little
underwhelming
and
then
builds
in
some
toasted
malt
flavor
before
become
more
roasted
and
drying
on
the
finish
which
is
slightly
lingering
just
a
tiny
hint
of
some
piney
hops
toward
the
end
and
a
decent
medium
body
a
decent
bock
this
poured
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
bready
yeast
and
roasted
barley
with
some
lemon
and
copper
hops
and
caramel
malt
it
tasted
like
lemon
and
copper
hops
with
bready
yeast
and
dirty
barley
and
light
caramel
malt
it
was
watery
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
an
unimpressive
beer
with
too
much
hops
and
not
enough
malt
the
flavor
wasnt
very
clean
and
the
body
was
too
bubbly
and
thin
this
wasnt
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
isnt
recommended
although
it
honestly
wasnt
offensive
to
drink
so
i
could
easily
finish
my
bottle
it
was
just
boring
and
wasnt
what
i
look
for
in
a
bock
d
a
good
brew
nothing
outstanding
here
but
a
decent
brew
nonetheless
but
maybe
things
have
changed
drinkability
overall
is
solid
for
what
it
is
a
throwback
bock
beer
from
yuengling
is
a
welcome
addition
to
their
bottled
lineup
i
had
it
on
tap
last
season
when
they
first
re
released
it
a
beer
that
i
will
definitely
enjoy
again
in
the
future
its
more
interesting
than
most
other
macros
out
there
trying
to
brew
something
different
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
color
with
a
12
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
pilsner
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
slightly
metallic
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
bone
dry
pilsner
malt
taste
with
a
slight
roastedcaramel
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
your
basic
bock
beer
its
easy
drinking
with
nonoffensive
good
beer
from
yuengling
though
not
amazing
drinkability
its
light
and
somewhat
easy
to
drink
although
i
have
to
say
i
expected
something
with
more
flavor
i
understand
why
yuengling
wanted
to
maintain
their
recognizable
taste
but
i
think
they
could
have
made
a
much
better
bock
than
what
i
have
sitting
before
me
drinkability
not
good
wouldnt
try
again
but
certaintly
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
the
label
is
really
cool
just
wish
they
had
used
some
better
quality
adhesive
yuengling
bock
is
a
very
clear
and
sparkling
copper
lager
with
a
bubbly
khaki
head
that
leaves
solid
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
touch
sweet
and
pretzely
smells
kind
of
like
malt
extract
it
smells
like
brewing
beer
and
baking
pretzels
its
medium
light
bodied
and
pretty
lively
the
finish
is
a
little
gritty
but
pretty
clean
it
has
a
malty
pretzely
flavor
theres
a
nice
toastiness
to
it
theres
a
touch
of
caramel
and
maybe
even
chocolate
a
soft
slightly
herbal
bitterness
zips
it
up
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
impression
yuengling
is
americas
oldest
brewery
and
they
have
been
around
180
years
making
them
almost
as
old
as
herr
rick
he
is
immortal
ya
know
so
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
the
brewery
itself
it
just
is
a
weak
beer
for
the
style
just
not
for
me
but
someone
who
is
on
a
tight
budget
may
consider
this
beer
before
moving
up
the
ladder
to
actual
doublebocks
overall
a
style
wellrepresented
by
yuengling
a
bit
lighter
than
other
bocks
ive
had
but
a
good
try
nonetheless
bye
this
beer
surprised
me
for
some
reason
im
not
tradtionally
a
big
fan
of
bocks
but
i
think
this
one
will
make
me
seek
more
out
in
the
future
just
another
solid
beer
from
yuengling
pours
a
crystal
clear
brown
color
with
loose
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
sparse
cap
the
aroma
has
some
standard
grainy
sweetness
perhaps
a
touch
of
caramel
and
metallic
notes
not
sure
if
i
am
digging
the
aroma
too
much
the
taste
is
quite
neutral
leaning
on
the
grainy
sweetness
not
much
if
any
flavor
from
the
darker
malts
as
with
the
aroma
there
is
a
metallic
twang
towards
the
end
perhaps
some
tea
like
flavors
the
feel
is
light
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
with
what
seems
to
be
a
grassy
hop
bitterness
though
not
strong
a
very
average
bock
at
best
it
looks
the
part
but
lacks
the
depth
of
flavors
the
body
and
overall
feel
seems
off
medium
body
that
barely
stands
up
to
the
bock
name
as
a
history
teacher
i
appreciate
yuenglings
status
as
the
oldest
brewery
as
a
philadelphian
ive
drank
more
than
my
share
of
their
lager
i
applaud
yeungling
any
chance
i
get
theyre
the
best
thing
going
in
pottsville
actually
i
saw
the
bock
at
another
store
so
i
bought
2
sixers
one
for
me
and
another
for
sharing
if
these
seasonals
are
still
sitting
on
the
shelves
then
i
should
continue
to
buy
them
fo
rfear
that
the
store
will
not
reorder
pours
a
very
nice
shimmering
brown
with
some
decent
head
and
lacing
nice
crisp
malt
scent
fairly
thick
with
a
hint
of
lager
skunk
excellent
taste
very
deep
for
a
bock
with
nice
dark
malt
flavors
a
nice
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
caramel
goes
down
extremely
good
a
great
bock
and
the
best
for
its
cost
extra
points
on
both
appearance
and
drinkability
for
the
label
featuring
a
goat
drinking
beer
from
a
goblet
with
the
tagline
tastes
good
that
really
turns
me
on
i
only
bought
a
single
and
didnt
check
the
price
of
a
sixer
but
i
could
easily
see
this
replacing
the
lager
as
my
goto
cheap
beer
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
easily
session
this
one
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
brew
and
would
love
to
drink
it
again
i
guess
this
is
better
than
the
lager
or
premium
but
its
not
a
beer
i
would
care
to
drink
any
more
of
one
bottle
is
plenty
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
very
high
drinkability
medium
malt
background
and
a
light
crisp
finish
paired
with
a
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
maybe
my
taste
buds
just
were
overpowered
by
the
many
other
dark
beers
id
tried
in
the
past
straight
up
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
from
start
to
finish
i
wouldnt
try
to
predict
how
those
committed
dark
beer
aficionados
may
or
may
not
appreciate
yuenglings
bock
but
from
the
standpoint
of
a
now
casualseasonal
dark
drinker
this
one
may
fit
the
bill
for
drinkers
who
were
previously
turned
off
by
darker
beers
the
major
challenge
for
me
now
someone
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
is
that
its
limited
release
is
only
for
a
few
more
weeks
then
it
wont
be
available
again
until
next
january
this
is
a
little
hoppier
than
most
bocks
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
say
it
was
a
hoppy
beer
an
interesting
roasted
flavor
makes
it
worth
trying
but
its
not
exactly
outstanding
by
any
means
this
is
a
mediocre
bock
at
best
and
i
would
actually
classify
it
as
a
disappointment
yuengling
makes
quality
beer
at
a
great
pricepoint
and
i
buy
lager
and
black
and
tan
with
some
regularity
but
this
one
comes
up
a
bit
short
there
are
much
better
bocks
out
there
even
at
this
pricepoint
stegmaier
for
example
is
quite
a
bit
better
i
will
not
buy
again
overall
expecting
a
bit
more
too
bad
a
sweet
caramel
malt
and
toffee
aroma
and
flavor
carries
with
it
a
bit
of
toast
or
light
roast
smooth
malty
mouthfeel
is
a
pleasant
welcome
american
hops
give
some
citrus
grapefruit
pine
and
grass
give
the
beer
a
probitter
balance
pale
ale
flavor
both
type
and
intensity
is
not
common
for
bocks
neither
is
the
roast
but
the
beer
is
flavorful
and
bold
with
good
textures
and
an
overall
favorable
beer
drinking
experience
maybe
an
amber
ale
is
a
better
descriptor
i
wanted
more
malt
but
then
i
always
want
more
malt
this
one
is
solid
and
a
great
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
rotation
of
yuengling
brews
i
hope
they
start
doing
more
seasonal
brews
taste
perhaps
more
strongly
hopped
than
most
bocks
which
traditionally
are
not
strongly
hopped
pleasantly
light
malt
flavor
that
is
closest
to
maple
and
slightly
cocoa
taste
lingers
in
mouth
pours
a
filtered
clear
dark
amber
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
that
leave
some
lacing
aromas
are
typical
of
a
lager
apple
along
with
some
dark
fruit
character
from
the
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
bready
up
front
with
a
slight
herbal
hop
balance
but
dies
a
bit
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
not
what
i
expect
from
a
bock
but
it
is
still
decent
for
what
it
is
all
in
all
nothing
is
surprising
about
this
beer
but
it
is
still
a
solid
brew
very
glad
to
see
this
one
back
after
so
many
years
overall
this
is
a
good
offering
from
yuengling
definitely
better
than
their
traditional
lager
this
is
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
definitely
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
d
even
though
it
is
heavy
bodied
i
have
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
d
im
fairly
impressed
by
this
offering
from
yuengling
i
was
a
little
concerned
this
would
just
be
a
darker
version
of
their
traditional
lager
but
this
has
a
little
character
yuengling
bock
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
theres
a
malty
aroma
thats
fairly
nice
the
flavor
is
malty
at
first
then
some
hops
and
grain
flavors
come
to
the
surface
a
decent
beer
but
really
nothing
special
a
good
easy
drinking
brew
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
that
is
very
easy
going
an
easydrinking
bock
with
a
nice
character
and
relatively
mild
abv
for
style
pours
a
dark
translucent
mahogany
with
a
decent
beige
head
what
i
got
was
not
thick
but
that
is
probably
an
artifact
of
preparing
the
pint
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
spicy
not
too
strong
flavor
is
rich
malty
and
yeasty
with
woody
and
toffee
hints
fizzy
and
lively
texture
leaves
a
nice
tingle
behind
d
heavier
that
i
expected
d
im
absolutely
stunned
by
how
good
this
is
im
definitely
getting
more
of
this
ive
only
had
this
brew
once
im
not
sure
how
much
it
cost
if
its
the
same
price
as
traditional
lager
i
would
pick
up
a
case
not
the
most
impressive
dark
lager
but
not
bad
decent
for
a
macro
brew
drinkability
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
but
i
have
to
say
as
of
now
i
found
this
particular
bottle
to
be
pretty
much
down
right
bad
didnt
taste
like
anything
i
would
have
expected
for
the
style
of
a
bock
just
missed
the
mark
on
all
points
and
i
usually
find
yuengling
stuff
to
be
a
nice
deal
hmm
give
another
try
but
not
good
d
goes
down
nice
and
easy
i
had
this
last
spring
on
draft
at
the
brewery
and
they
said
they
were
going
to
bottle
it
this
year
i
am
very
glad
they
did
love
the
1940s
label
with
the
goat
drinking
beer
and
saying
tastes
good
i
recomend
if
you
can
get
some
to
give
it
a
try
they
have
done
a
great
job
making
this
one
i
have
stocked
up
with
3
cases
dark
amber
in
appearance
with
lacing
that
goes
away
quickly
a
bit
tart
with
a
nice
bite
at
the
end
a
very
drinkable
beer
little
sad
i
didnt
try
this
beer
last
year
since
alot
of
people
say
last
years
batch
was
better
love
the
awsome
artwork
for
the
lable
cheers
drinkability
maintains
the
traditional
appeal
that
you
would
expect
from
yuengling
yet
is
also
an
enhanced
more
developed
taste
good
job
yuengling
and
look
forward
to
future
endeavors
yuengling
has
stepped
up
and
bottled
this
seasonal
beer
and
i
am
impressed
with
the
quality
for
price
of
the
bock
beer
i
payed
7
00
in
pa
for
a
six
pack
of
really
good
beer
i
have
had
better
bocks
but
not
for
a
little
over
a
dollar
a
bottle
drinkability
apparently
its
been
nearly
forty
long
years
since
ole
yuengling
produced
a
bock
i
found
it
to
be
not
only
easily
drinkable
and
reasonably
sessionable
but
a
decent
bargain
at
six
bucks
a
sixer
taste
is
first
of
some
hop
bitterness
followed
mellow
sweetness
and
some
slightly
astringent
fizzyness
slightly
too
bitter
for
style
but
highly
drinkable
nonetheless
if
anything
id
be
glad
to
drink
this
in
place
of
the
lager
year
round
taste
is
malt
there
is
a
little
hop
bite
on
the
end
but
its
not
that
big
if
youve
had
a
yuengling
lager
its
like
that
but
a
little
more
intense
malt
and
a
little
more
hops
a
fine
beer
for
sure
the
best
from
this
brewer
ive
had
nice
coppery
sort
of
color
decent
head
that
fades
all
to
quickly
bready
aromasomewhat
nutty
as
well
slight
copperymetalic
tinge
to
it
ok
malty
flavoragain
a
metallic
presence
detracts
from
the
over
all
flavor
mild
caramel
like
flavor
ok
mouthfeellacks
the
malt
body
of
a
decent
bock
ok
overallnothing
really
stands
out
for
me
give
me
a
regular
yuengling
lager
over
this
dr
yes
i
like
this
stuff
not
as
good
as
their
porter
or
bt
but
good
the
goat
is
a
nice
touch
too
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
is
rather
mild
some
malts
taste
is
malty
a
touch
of
chocoalte
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
mfd
a
little
on
the
thin
side
watery
and
lacking
in
any
real
body
went
down
easy
enough
not
the
best
but
not
bad
for
the
6
99
price
tag
d
i
could
easly
drink
alot
of
these
and
not
relise
it
and
now
this
year
you
can
get
it
in
cases
so
i
will
for
sure
be
buying
alot
of
this
if
its
still
around
in
april
im
going
to
take
a
bunch
on
my
fishing
trip
this
is
more
shiner
bock
than
anchor
bock
overall
you
could
kick
back
with
this
but
you
wont
get
a
kick
of
flavor
with
this
beer
d
a
very
low
alcohol
bock
id
be
happy
sipping
on
this
on
a
breezy
spring
day
next
time
ill
get
it
locally
rather
than
drive
to
ithaca
drinkability
pretty
average
overall
everythings
a
bit
too
mild
and
tonedown
on
overall
flavor
maybe
a
hoppier
thicker
yuengling
in
a
way
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
overall
as
i
was
excited
to
try
this
and
was
let
down
a
bit
drinkability
nicely
quaffable
but
more
than
a
few
of
these
may
wear
thin
on
you
worth
trying
since
this
seems
to
a
be
a
one
off
beer
got
this
at
a
block
party
on
tap
into
a
plastic
cup
this
so
far
has
been
my
favorite
offering
by
yeungling
as
in
their
other
beers
its
far
from
perfect
but
its
adeep
dark
brew
not
much
going
on
in
the
smell
but
some
malt
same
with
the
taste
had
an
odd
bite
to
it
nothing
really
off
or
unpleasant
i
like
darker
beers
even
on
a
hot
day
and
this
hit
the
spot
though
average
not
to
style
imo
but
plenty
drinkable
i
actually
like
the
idea
of
yuengling
doing
a
seasonal
selection
its
much
overdue
i
think
this
one
was
a
bit
off
kilter
but
i
think
there
is
a
good
chance
that
improvements
could
be
made
with
this
one
i
also
like
themy
idea
of
a
possible
festbier
from
the
folks
at
yuengling
i
believe
they
could
capitalize
on
that
one
during
the
fall
season
with
their
signature
lager
yeast
drinkability
this
beer
is
decent
nothing
unique
about
it
just
a
standard
everyday
bock
d
its
nice
to
try
something
new
from
yuengling
im
glad
they
came
out
with
this
bock
nothing
special
but
it
was
pretty
tasty
theres
a
desperate
need
of
alcohol
here
as
it
tastes
a
good
bit
like
goya
malta
or
some
other
similar
travesty
no
phenols
no
doughy
feel
very
noticeable
corners
cut
a
very
piss
poor
attempt
d
very
drinkable
great
session
bock
had
on
tap
at
the
gin
mill
in
ellicottville
ny
on
415
on
tap
at
coopers
in
scranton
at
the
front
bar
presented
in
a
shaker
pint
glass
this
bock
appears
a
clear
rich
deep
chestnut
color
with
about
half
an
inch
of
creamy
light
tan
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
sweet
caramelized
malt
biscuits
and
a
hint
of
molasses
and
an
even
smaller
hint
of
brown
sugar
this
beer
is
all
about
the
malt
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
its
nice
to
try
something
new
from
yuengling
im
sure
ill
be
seeing
plenty
of
this
around
and
thats
a
good
thing
especially
at
a
place
with
limited
choices
overall
a
bit
light
on
the
flavors
but
well
balanced
and
definitely
sessionable
i
would
say
this
is
better
than
their
lager
dhey
a
new
beer
from
yuengling
while
this
one
wont
blow
you
away
it
certainly
has
enough
flavour
and
smoothness
to
make
it
worthy
of
a
pint
or
two
the
price
point
is
right
to
make
it
even
more
interesting
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
d
decent
enough
bock
and
a
good
inexpensive
session
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
warrant
more
than
one
in
a
single
sitting
its
nice
to
see
something
other
than
lager
on
tap
at
the
local
establishments
very
high
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
masses
itll
be
hard
to
not
like
it
crowdpleaser
d
5
10
is
low
but
i
would
only
go
for
two
before
moving
on
either
way
its
a
nice
to
have
a
alternative
to
the
regular
yuengling
when
your
at
a
average
run
of
the
mill
bar
there
is
a
place
for
this
but
could
use
some
more
abv
for
the
style
and
a
bigger
body
overall
a
very
tasty
and
well
made
bock
bravo
i
look
forward
to
many
more
of
these
d
yuengling
dials
in
a
winner
here
excellent
brew
and
better
than
the
rest
of
the
yuengling
line
which
is
not
too
shabby
would
buy
cases
of
this
frankly
im
not
surprised
but
this
turned
out
to
be
a
very
bland
beer
it
was
clean
both
in
that
there
were
clearly
no
flaws
but
that
the
flavor
profile
is
similar
to
that
of
water
there
is
a
pleasant
kiss
of
spicy
hops
in
the
aftertaste
but
consider
thats
all
my
tongue
could
pick
up
the
hops
are
really
the
only
taste
the
beer
reminds
me
a
bit
of
bland
spring
ales
or
a
watery
copper
ale
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
unlike
the
lager
this
is
unlike
any
of
the
yuenglings
ive
had
in
the
past
you
can
easily
have
a
six
pack
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
only
a
little
more
presence
than
yuenglings
lager
offering
drinkability
is
good
a
few
of
these
would
go
down
easy
not
sure
that
id
stick
with
this
one
however
i
was
able
to
give
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
while
at
mahars
had
a
darker
amber
color
to
it
with
some
reddish
highlights
good
sized
head
that
had
nice
long
retention
and
lacing
the
aromas
where
good
they
highlighted
a
nice
roasted
and
caramel
scent
the
flavor
brought
this
beer
up
a
notch
as
i
felt
that
the
malts
where
better
here
than
even
the
profile
from
the
nose
also
a
nice
hop
flavor
presence
is
there
muted
in
the
background
but
plays
nicely
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
i
would
have
to
say
by
far
the
best
that
i
have
had
from
yuengling
and
hope
that
this
will
not
just
be
a
one
and
done
style
from
them
had
a
draft
at
maxs
tuesday
the
3rd
this
was
not
an
impressive
beer
not
much
of
a
nose
and
the
flavor
was
fair
with
little
finish
it
does
go
down
pretty
easy
though
its
hard
to
believe
that
its
a
blend
of
two
decent
beers
the
chesterfield
and
the
porter
according
to
don
russell
it
would
seem
like
more
chet
than
porter
maybe
2
to
1
i
have
the
feeling
that
this
will
go
better
with
the
regular
lager
crowd
m
d
moderate
carbonation
over
a
medium
body
its
got
a
little
bit
of
delayed
weightiness
towards
the
finish
all
in
all
a
pretyh
tasty
and
easy
going
beer
im
quite
pleased
with
this
and
have
to
give
kudos
to
yuengling
worth
checking
out
just
missed
salesman
who
dropped
off
sample
at
local
club
didnt
have
a
chance
to
quiz
him
on
the
details
bottle
was
a
quart
size
growler
looking
vessel
had
pint
sample
taste
and
appearance
very
nice
just
as
good
or
better
than
shiners
or
others
of
this
style
like
to
explore
further
samplings
a
recommended
try
on
a
new
style
from
an
established
brewer
americas
oldest
chalk
this
one
up
along
with
yuenglings
other
underrated
styles
black
tan
and
porter
probably
the
best
bock
ive
had
the
belgian
yeastiness
is
just
what
the
traditional
german
bock
style
needs
on
tap
at
the
public
house
in
la
jolla
calif
i
really
enjoyed
this
block
beer
and
put
it
up
there
with
ayinger
celebrator
though
it
goes
in
a
different
direction
the
fusion
of
styles
is
truly
imaginative
classy
and
clever
the
richer
malt
character
complements
the
belgian
complexity
in
seamless
fashion
it
doesnt
hurt
that
the
brewing
execution
is
also
stellar
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
dunkel
bock
overall
not
a
typical
bock
at
all
the
roasted
malts
are
very
different
from
most
and
the
cherry
taste
is
very
unusual
but
i
really
like
this
very
interesting
and
balanced
la
trappe
is
the
only
trappist
brewery
who
makes
such
a
huge
variety
of
beers
i
think
most
of
them
are
mediocre
and
while
is
this
not
a
perfect
bock
at
all
its
very
interesting
and
really
good
in
its
own
way
md
the
carbonation
level
comes
almost
perfect
not
too
lively
but
ever
so
soothing
and
fine
to
caress
the
palate
gently
the
body
is
full
even
for
the
7
0abv
strength
never
cloying
although
the
sugary
content
does
leave
a
somewhat
slick
feel
on
the
palate
at
the
end
of
each
sip
all
in
all
having
had
an
ale
version
of
bockbier
this
good
i
wonder
if
i
should
pay
the
netherlands
a
visit
anytime
sooner
this
ale
is
delicious
intriguingly
balanced
and
moreish
as
long
as
one
can
handle
the
alcohol
and
sugary
content
well
at
ones
good
pace
o
very
sweet
complex
and
nice
if
your
pleasure
is
hops
and
not
malts
avoid
if
not
this
fantastic
the
amberbrown
la
trappe
is
transparent
with
a
lightlytanned
neck
very
well
retained
perfect
to
style
the
bready
aroma
displays
very
well
the
malty
character
of
the
beer
showing
also
caramel
tones
and
alcohol
content
perfect
again
the
taste
brings
a
wellcarbonated
mediumbody
beer
with
hops
well
harmonized
with
the
malty
body
the
latter
slightly
sweet
once
again
perfect
to
style
the
end
is
somewhat
long
bringing
again
the
whole
maltcaramel
story
what
an
excellent
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
orange
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
dark
fruits
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
too
much
carbonation
overall
an
interesting
beer
with
ups
and
downs
nevertheless
certainly
not
to
forget
when
talking
about
dutch
bockbier
a
country
that
is
full
of
the
style
around
the
dark
times
of
the
year
overall
its
a
peculiar
concoction
a
trappist
bock
but
i
dont
think
it
brings
anything
sublime
to
the
table
its
tasty
though
not
a
bad
representative
of
a
strongish
bock
overall
a
good
beer
still
i
prefer
the
classic
belgian
dark
ales
over
bocks
the
malts
rule
the
taste
as
well
malty
molasses
giving
the
beer
a
rich
smooth
feel
and
flavour
most
likely
the
best
bock
i
had
while
on
the
trip
another
bar
was
having
a
bock
fest
and
had
around
8
on
tap
so
i
managed
to
try
a
few
as
you
do
as
i
wrote
before
this
is
the
best
bock
beer
ive
tasted
this
far
i
will
surely
get
some
more
to
drink
during
the
cold
days
of
autumn
plus
another
couple
to
keep
in
my
cellar
o
a
great
beer
from
la
trappe
that
is
a
take
on
a
classic
german
style
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
midlevel
carbonation
thats
a
bit
prickly
on
the
tongue
at
first
but
quickly
levels
off
to
create
a
crisp
and
wellflowing
mouthfeel
carbonation
could
be
toned
down
just
a
bit
and
this
would
not
suffer
just
a
hint
of
ethanol
in
the
nostrils
and
back
of
throat
when
closing
out
a
sip
finish
is
dry
with
some
stickiness
left
around
the
edges
of
the
mouth
due
to
residual
sugars
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
id
happily
have
3
or
4
in
a
sitting
i
served
mine
straight
from
the
fridge
which
i
wouldnt
do
next
time
and
there
probably
will
be
a
next
time
good
tasty
beer
flavoursome
but
not
overly
complex
would
personally
prefer
this
brewerys
ales
overall
i
liked
it
but
could
have
been
better
without
doubt
a
nice
bockbeer
and
face
it
the
only
trappist
bock
in
the
world
drinkability
very
interesting
beer
more
than
any
other
bockbier
ive
drunk
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
for
some
this
is
a
great
beer
for
sessions
it
is
easily
drank
and
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
the
brew
isnt
too
complex
however
bottle
poured
a
clear
burgundy
color
ale
with
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
residual
sugar
with
some
caramelized
malt
taste
is
a
good
mix
between
some
caramelized
malt
with
light
toffee
notes
with
some
residual
sugar
boyd
is
about
average
but
has
a
nice
creamy
texture
with
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
with
nice
level
of
complexity
for
style
a
spectacular
bock
lively
and
a
joy
to
drink
la
trappe
is
doing
it
right
very
well
made
this
brew
poured
out
with
a
nice
deep
amber
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
malts
on
the
nose
and
even
a
touch
of
spice
and
yeast
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
nice
subtle
caramel
sweetness
upfront
that
fades
into
a
dry
toasted
flavor
there
seems
like
there
could
be
some
autumnal
spices
in
this
as
well
but
theyre
very
faint
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
has
a
good
amount
of
body
too
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
still
enjoy
their
quad
the
most
but
this
is
probably
the
next
best
thing
la
trappe
puts
out
it
certainly
retained
its
carbonation
nicely
i
had
about
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
that
quickly
fizzed
its
way
out
of
existence
color
was
a
colabrown
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
nose
was
rich
with
a
caramel
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
definite
caramel
taste
on
the
tongue
almost
a
burnt
caramel
aspect
finish
was
very
sweet
with
the
caramel
flavor
simply
lingering
well
after
the
swallow
wow
bock
at
0500
i
must
not
be
working
this
summer
i
would
recommend
this
as
more
of
a
dessert
beer
than
a
wakeup
beer
overall
its
an
interesting
belgianstyle
take
on
this
german
style
it
definitely
varies
from
traditional
bocks
that
i
remember
with
much
more
rich
flavors
a
solid
4
0
from
me
overall
t
sweet
notes
at
the
beggining
some
toast
malts
are
noticed
at
this
moment
after
that
you
get
the
warmer
sensation
comming
from
the
alcohol
the
caramel
notes
appear
after
this
making
a
good
mix
of
flavour
a
clean
falvour
no
bitternes
at
all
the
end
is
not
long
on
toast
flavour
but
is
persistent
chewy
end
o
dont
expect
a
traditional
bock
beer
here
in
fact
i
think
that
the
idea
behind
it
was
producing
a
bock
keeping
the
characteristics
of
a
trappist
i
like
it
and
really
recommend
it
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
good
but
heavier
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
of
the
first
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
od
too
yeasty
imo
i
would
never
think
of
a
bock
being
that
yeasty
not
enough
fruity
malt
character
giving
it
richness
not
bad
but
falls
short
where
it
doesnt
need
to
o
very
nice
simple
beer
i
would
enjoy
another
bottle
or
two
of
this
in
the
cellar
it
is
a
decent
bockbier
and
certainly
interesting
considering
the
brewery
and
location
md
a
great
bock
or
is
it
the
bottle
label
claims
this
beer
is
top
fermented
so
it
seems
almost
unfair
to
compare
to
traditional
bocks
either
way
this
is
a
great
beer
that
offers
malt
complexity
that
is
wellbalanced
with
hops
exceptionally
well
made
beer
complex
smooth
and
balanced
a
sipper
to
savor
and
share
ive
had
this
one
a
few
times
sometimes
it
has
struck
me
as
this
sample
did
as
really
special
but
i
can
also
recall
being
underwhelmed
not
this
time
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
strength
of
flavoring
it
can
be
easy
for
a
bock
to
come
across
as
a
dulled
down
little
brother
of
a
doppelbock
but
here
we
find
that
all
of
that
richness
is
preserved
there
were
heavy
malts
with
generously
distributed
sweet
and
roasty
flavors
allowing
this
brew
to
compete
as
exemplary
for
the
category
drinkability
a
solidly
drinkable
brew
im
glad
i
found
this
one
at
my
local
bottle
shop
a
good
authentic
bock
like
this
is
a
treat
tried
it
with
a
stake
dinner
and
it
washed
down
amazingly
tastes
like
a
leffe
brown
a
bit
heavy
so
you
wont
want
to
drink
it
for
drinking
like
in
a
bar
you
want
it
with
dinner
dont
overdo
it
cause
it
fills
you
up
just
like
a
good
bock
should
wow
never
had
this
beer
before
never
seen
it
i
think
it
will
disappear
magically
or
something
like
a
dream
into
the
night
because
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
beers
i
have
ever
had
evar
for
the
rest
i
can
say
the
smell
is
good
and
warm
dito
for
the
taste
a
very
well
balanced
bockbeer
pours
a
deep
copper
brownish
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
rich
and
fruity
in
the
taste
rich
nutty
and
fruit
hints
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
fruit
like
aftertaste
nice
flavor
and
aroma
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
d
very
dark
and
heavy
to
drink
the
taste
is
fairly
distinctive
being
the
only
trappist
beer
of
this
kind
but
the
bitter
nature
might
not
be
to
everyones
liking
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
brown
sugar
yeast
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
dark
fruit
the
main
fruit
i
get
is
raisins
as
well
as
brown
sugar
caramel
malt
alcohol
and
yeast
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
too
similar
to
a
bock
it
tastes
much
more
belgian
than
german
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
huge
foamy
head
leaves
beautiful
belgian
lace
after
a
few
minutes
the
nose
is
malty
and
sweet
with
light
aromas
of
spice
and
dried
herbs
chocolate
caramel
and
raisin
notes
make
more
of
a
showing
once
the
head
dissipates
a
sharp
little
kick
of
fruity
yeast
immediately
followed
by
the
drying
hallertauer
hops
an
average
example
of
the
style
in
no
way
a
standout
flavor
is
very
nice
not
the
best
bock
out
there
but
super
solid
and
overall
a
great
beer
medium
body
high
carbonation
crisp
very
low
booze
caramel
notes
tons
of
fruit
and
very
malty
mixed
with
the
belgian
yeasts
this
is
a
very
good
beer
thanks
damon
again
for
bringing
it
over
nice
beer
d
the
beer
is
definitely
filling
but
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
d
wow
this
is
one
fantastic
beer
to
date
this
bock
is
as
close
to
perfection
as
ive
come
delicious
pours
a
dark
russet
with
a
dense
tan
head
the
smell
is
sulfured
molasses
swamp
moss
fallen
leaves
strong
tea
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
molasses
with
caramel
malts
something
like
blood
sausage
and
a
graphite
minerality
in
the
finish
the
comes
back
around
to
the
molasses
its
thick
though
not
too
viscous
heavy
without
being
cloying
its
like
no
other
bock
beer
ive
had
and
altogether
excellent
i
could
have
had
another
bottle
seek
this
one
out
opinion
well
i
had
pretty
high
expectations
for
this
beer
it
is
good
but
falls
short
of
what
i
would
consider
outstanding
the
lack
of
malt
in
the
finish
really
hurt
this
beer
in
my
opinion
all
that
said
this
beer
really
has
a
pretty
good
flavor
and
i
will
certainly
drink
the
whole
bottle
so
it
doesnt
suck
it
just
reminds
me
on
an
amped
up
tilburg
more
than
a
beer
to
stand
up
to
korbinian
or
even
erdinger
urbock
if
you
want
to
stand
it
against
a
nondoppelbock
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
have
enjoyed
another
one
a
nice
beer
for
a
cool
evening
notes
also
brewed
with
rey
and
wheat
after
the
example
of
the
jopen
bokbier
but
a
little
sweeter
than
jopen
bokbier
overall
one
of
the
best
bock
beers
out
there
maybe
even
the
best
perfectly
balanced
bitterness
and
sweetness
but
lets
be
honest
what
else
can
be
expected
from
a
bock
beer
brewed
by
an
authentic
trappist
d
wow
this
is
a
great
bokbeer
this
is
so
much
better
than
their
dubbel
will
surely
stock
some
of
these
id
recommend
this
a
bockbeer
within
the
trappist
tradition
has
a
lot
of
interesting
notes
is
worth
a
try
this
25
4
oz750
ml
bottle
was
my
second
experience
with
koninghoevens
offerings
and
i
was
impressed
with
this
bock
the
pour
into
a
hennepin
ommegang
tulip
glass
produced
a
good
persistent
tan
head
with
moderate
stickiness
the
recentlyacquired
tulip
glass
really
helped
concentrate
the
odor
i
highly
recommend
them
the
brown
color
with
strong
red
highlights
advertised
a
substantial
beer
experience
the
odor
was
vaguely
fruity
malty
surprise
with
bread
toast
overlays
the
fruit
character
was
hard
to
pin
down
it
was
not
estery
or
bananalike
the
taste
did
not
disappoint
breadcrust
malty
flavors
dominated
but
a
general
balanced
fruitiness
rounded
out
the
primary
flavor
as
the
beer
warmed
in
the
second
half
of
the
bottle
the
fruit
character
hinted
at
apples
and
pears
the
aftertaste
had
a
tinge
of
roasted
barley
with
coffee
overtones
but
it
was
neither
dominant
nor
persistent
a
tinge
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
alcoholic
heat
helped
keep
this
from
being
cloyingly
sweet
the
sticky
full
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasant
this
beer
is
like
a
sip
of
autumn
harvest
i
enjoyed
this
trappist
selection
very
much
and
expect
to
purchase
again
in
the
future
drink
my
kind
of
beer
dark
with
lots
of
flavor
its
definitely
something
to
enjoy
slowly
with
a
meal
or
on
its
own
id
have
it
again
and
no
doubt
will
very
easy
drinking
the
setting
was
nice
and
added
to
the
experience
more
malty
chocolate
on
the
palate
along
mild
roasty
coffee
grassy
hop
bitterness
is
fairly
assertive
for
the
style
as
in
the
nose
plenty
of
spice
and
even
some
anise
above
average
drinkability
and
interesting
flavor
profile
everything
i
look
for
in
the
style
another
great
trappist
beer
mdthis
just
floats
off
the
tongue
and
begs
to
be
sipped
faster
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
and
was
glad
i
got
it
i
would
drink
a
keg
of
this
if
i
could
a
good
beer
get
one
if
you
can
drinkability
quite
nice
to
sip
and
easy
to
finish
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
even
though
its
7
abv
i
always
love
being
blown
away
by
beer
of
a
style
that
isnt
among
my
favorites
the
label
reads
taste
the
silence
thats
a
pretty
good
tagline
it
doesnt
apply
however
because
koningshoeven
bock
makes
beautiful
music
from
the
very
first
mouthful
loud
yet
refined
just
like
i
like
em
a
750ml
bottle
corked
and
caged
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
it
was
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
little
bit
of
red
a
voluminous
tan
head
that
looked
like
whipped
cream
caramel
malt
and
dark
fruit
aroma
caramel
and
raisin
taste
good
malt
background
a
good
beer
for
the
price
notes
yet
another
in
a
long
line
of
successful
trappist
beers
koningshoeven
is
certainly
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
world
pours
a
threefinger
creambeige
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good

for
a
750ml
bottle
from
a
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
la
trappe
is
not
on
the
label
anymore
cheers
am
i
tasting
the
silence
i
might
actually
be
an
exciting
balance
between
a
trappist
ale
and
the
bock
style
more
or
less
in
the
same
line
as
for
example
the
la
chouffe
bock
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
clear
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
huge
khaki
colored
head
that
dissipated
into
a
puffy
cap
and
left
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
dimple
mug
the
aroma
is
of
dark
toasted
malt
with
hints
of
red
wine
and
roasted
meat
the
red
wine
flavors
dominate
up
front
with
a
touch
of
metal
following
a
solid
toasted
grain
and
bready
malt
backbone
supports
the
sweetness
the
feel
is
of
a
nice
full
body
with
active
carbonation
chewy
finishes
sweet
i
do
like
the
maltier
bocks
and
this
fits
the
bill
good
balance
between
the
sweet
and
malt
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
im
not
sure
ill
be
a
regular
quaffer
of
it
as
it
warms
the
booziness
seems
a
little
too
much
its
hitting
the
spot
well
as
i
watch
obamas
thankyou
speech
i
like
it
i
was
skeptical
but
i
like
it
nice
take
on
a
german
style
that
adds
the
requisite
trappist
yeast
full
head
creamy
body
and
more
than
enough
hops
to
bring
some
balance
to
an
occasionally
maltstarring
show
i
was
very
surprised
to
see
la
trappe
launching
a
bock
beer
i
got
it
right
away
and
tried
it
the
same
evening
la
trappe
tripple
and
quadrupel
are
always
high
in
my
list
of
preference
and
i
respect
this
brewery
very
much
so
my
expectations
were
very
high
but
i
got
a
little
dissapointed
this
is
a
very
good
beer
indeed
but
i
was
expecting
something
really
exceptional
it
has
a
very
strong
taste
for
a
bock
a
little
too
strong
for
me
but
then
it
is
not
a
typical
bock
there
is
a
hint
of
quadrupel
in
it
but
perhaps
its
just
my
idea
it
has
a
wellbalanced
smell
and
a
beautiful
rich
darkbrown
kindared
color
i
would
drink
this
beer
as
a
delicacy
but
not
in
large
ammounts
taste
of
tin
watery
malt
some
cocoa
touch
of
caramel
some
spice
a
good
beerit
is
just
that
i
expected
so
much
more
from
the
monks
not
remotely
a
bad
beer
but
expectations
are
higher
for
trappist
ales
or
whatever
this
is
if
youre
going
after
trappist
in
general
or
koningshoeven
in
particular
then
stick
to
the
more
traditional
ale
styles
and
if
you
really
want
a
great
bock
then
the
germans
or
even
gordon
biersch
can
hook
you
up
more
cheaply
and
satisfyingly
a
decent
brew
but
well
under
the
usual
high
quality
of
koningshoeven
i
will
keep
my
koningshoeven
buys
with
the
more
traditional
trappist
styles
a
very
pleasant
drink
even
if
it
is
a
tad
bit
too
sweet
gonna
try
this
one
again
for
sure
recommended
i
had
this
as
the
koningshoeven
bock
which
came
in
a
different
wrapper
than
the
la
trappe
but
im
assuming
it
is
all
the
same
the
beer
pours
the
thickest
frothiest
well
retained
head
that
ive
seen
on
just
about
any
beer
this
is
the
thickest
chewiest
full
bodied
bock
youre
likely
to
find
the
taste
was
strong
brown
sugar
molasses
caramel
malts
there
are
plenty
of
roasted
malts
and
brown
malts
to
accompany
the
sweet
molasses
and
sugars
found
in
this
beer
the
beer
is
complex
made
with
a
number
of
different
malts
and
hops
combinations
listed
on
the
label
and
the
taste
is
just
robust
there
is
a
bit
of
a
throaty
aftertaste
and
the
abv
isnt
hidden
all
that
well
but
there
are
plenty
of
warming
notes
that
do
make
it
interesting
the
beer
is
complex
thick
husky
and
a
very
memorable
bock
style
beer
worth
looking
for
lchaim
not
really
in
my
price
range
but
it
went
down
like
it
was
on
someone
elses
tab
d
quite
drinkable
tapped
at
abbot
on
the
hill
a
great
haul
for
them
pours
an
active
dark
brown
with
white
crown
bold
malt
and
yeast
aroma
including
chocolate
malt
carbonation
natural
does
not
quit
in
your
face
tastea
bit
rochfortcocacola
caramel
like
some
nutmeg
overall
not
too
complex
good
drinkability
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
massive
head
several
inches
of
fluffy
stuff
very
nice
lacing
a
lovely
beer
the
aroma
has
nice
caramel
and
roasted
feeling
some
fruits
with
a
definite
lager
nose
with
a
belgian
feel
to
it
more
spices
from
yeast
in
the
taste
and
again
a
nice
sweetness
the
mouth
is
a
bit
carbonated
for
an
otherwise
slick
smooth
feel
but
good
body
keeps
it
real
pretty
decent
but
i
probably
paid
too
much
for
it
one
and
done
ill
be
keeping
to
the
beers
theyre
known
for
pretty
drinkable
for
me
because
i
like
hops
but
its
probably
over
the
top
for
bock
purists
poured
with
a
nice
head
and
some
lace
very
ahcoholic
aroma
decent
dark
wood
color
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
expect
in
a
bock
give
em
credit
for
distinction
though
full
mouth
filling
body
slightly
unpleasant
bitter
finish
not
one
of
my
favorites
some
odd
stuff
going
on
here
cant
recommend
it
the
score
i
give
is
me
trying
to
be
objective
subjectively
would
a
been
much
worse
more
bock
flavors
and
aromas
show
up
as
it
warms
but
the
belgian
notes
are
still
there
i
really
like
this
beer
no
matter
what
style
it
is
drinkability
is
great
this
is
an
excellent
bock
with
a
few
things
to
call
its
own
namely
the
subtle
roasted
character
and
the
semidry
finish
altogether
wow
what
a
bock
i
say
what
a
bock
this
is
one
that
will
be
frequented
by
this
beeradvocate
cheers
cheers
and
beers
dude
one
of
the
better
bockbiers
from
holland
without
doubt
a
nice
bockbeer
and
face
it
the
only
trappist
bock
in
the
world
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
will
seek
this
out
again
for
sure
right
up
there
with
the
trappist
belgians
by
koningshoeven
smooth
and
creamy
munich
malt
i
believe
unbelievable
mouthfeel
and
taste
perfect
if
i
could
dare
say
very
well
done
dunkler
bock
lagered
very
well
for
at
least
3
months
must
try
from
norways
oldest
brewery
dating
back
to
1834
family
owned
for
four
generations
now
taste
is
good
a
bit
sweet
with
hints
of
salmiak
the
mouthfeel
could
be
better
with
some
carbonation
a
really
good
looking
pretty
good
tasting
beer
cool
name
though
an
unremarkable
but
enjoyable
brew
definitely
better
than
the
juleol
i
had
last
night
d
top
notch
at
6
5
will
likely
catch
up
to
you
before
long
but
i
could
really
sit
down
and
savor
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
truly
great
find
wish
i
had
a
fresh
bottle
to
compare
considering
the
source
this
one
is
probably
5
years
old
happy
spring
pours
a
nice
medium
brown
with
not
much
head
to
speak
ofbig
fruity
aromas
some
orange
peel
along
with
some
sweet
caramel
and
nuttiness
taste
is
dominated
by
a
caramel
sweetness
with
an
underlying
bread
dough
maltiness
not
overly
sweet
but
not
much
if
any
hops
to
be
found
somewhat
of
a
modest
bock
but
not
a
bad
brew
i
would
drink
again
givin
the
chance
very
drinkable
bock
beer
a
good
example
of
the
style
sweet
at
first
showing
off
its
malty
side
which
is
soon
followed
by
a
smooth
herbaceousness
inherent
to
its
hoppy
side
a
perfect
blend
of
ingredients
truly
a
remarkable
beer
aass
bock
beer
came
in
a
green
bottle
the
color
was
an
opaque
brown
capped
with
a
small
head
that
dispersed
quickly
the
aroma
was
caramelly
with
some
floral
traces
the
taste
was
caramelly
and
toasted
with
a
hint
of
molasses
it
was
also
sweet
with
some
hop
bite
and
a
bit
oily
the
finish
was
semisweet
dry
and
bitter
over
all
it
was
a
fairly
smooth
and
wellbalanced
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
but
not
anything
to
subtract
from
enjoyment
drinakability
is
high
can
imagine
a
few
pints
of
this
would
do
some
damage
to
the
grey
matter
presented
in
a
green
12
ounce
bottle
the
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
big
puffy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
dominantly
cereal
maltiness
with
a
somewhat
fleeting
wortlike
character
very
nice
sweetness
up
front
and
a
nice
subtle
hop
finish
keeps
the
beer
from
being
cloying
wonderful
for
sipping
rich
intense
and
marvelously
drinkable
i
had
heard
that
this
beer
was
going
to
be
discontinued
but
fortunately
it
wasnt
a
quality
bock
with
a
name
that
wont
soon
be
forgotten
and
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
have
some
more
aass
got
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
viking
in
spokane
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
beer
tastes
considering
its
coming
in
a
green
bottle
probably
the
first
green
ive
encountered
that
wasnt
at
least
a
little
bit
skunked
anyway
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
tinges
of
red
when
held
towards
light
smell
of
sweet
fruity
malt
tasted
likewise
with
very
little
hop
presence
this
beer
is
nothing
without
its
malt
had
a
dark
yet
fruity
flavor
to
it
it
was
a
little
heavy
to
drink
this
is
not
something
i
would
have
downed
in
any
quantity
but
it
was
nice
after
my
meal
ive
been
to
norway
it
is
a
beautiful
country
and
aass
bock
is
an
incredible
beer
aass
according
to
their
website
a
real
norwegian
viking
would
pronounce
it
ouse
is
brewed
in
drammen
norway
and
comes
in
a
green
bottle
with
an
image
of
little
goat
drinking
from
a
stein
on
the
label
it
pours
dark
reddish
brown
with
minimal
head
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
as
its
enjoyed
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
a
little
carmel
the
taste
is
exceptional
this
is
beer
is
the
number
two
reason
why
id
like
to
move
to
norway
beat
only
by
the
number
one
reason
the
beautiful
norwegian
women
aass
is
the
best
bock
ive
ever
tasted
full
bodied
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
its
almost
too
easy
to
drink
sweet
malt
carmel
slight
fruitiness
and
a
little
hops
in
the
finish
damn
why
did
i
have
to
be
born
in
the
land
of
bud
and
miller
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
aass
bock
mmm
i
received
this
from
francisweisen
today
thanks
and
skoal
i
sampled
this
beer
a
looooong
time
ago
before
michael
jackson
began
rating
beer
or
dangling
babies
from
balconies
and
its
just
as
i
remembered
it
dark
brown
prune
juice
in
color
with
a
beigetan
head
and
slowsliding
lace
the
aroma
is
particularly
distinct
with
molasses
coffee
hops
and
light
alcohol
fume
the
molasses
sweet
malty
body
emits
flavors
of
raisins
and
prunes
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
citrusy
hops
add
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
for
the
style
nice
any
season
beer
i
could
see
having
this
beer
a
few
times
in
my
life
not
and
everydayer
but
on
occausion
i
knew
i
would
fail
to
miss
a
pun

damn
and
i
tried
so
hard
ive
only
encountered
2
retailers
selling
this
one
within
about
a
500
miles
radius
of
my
place
and
after
having
this
first
time
experience
with
it
ill
be
sure
to
keep
my
eyes
peeled
for
more
of
this
too
very
reasonably
priced
1
98usd
for
a
11
2fl
oz
green
bottle
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
very
little
foam
that
dissapated
quickly
the
aroma
was
of
a
malty
grainy
smell
the
taste
was
of
a
sour
bitterness
that
really
turned
me
off
i
just
dont
care
for
this
beer
the
sour
feeling
in
my
mouth
was
the
turn
off
mahogony
in
color
the
head
dissipates
quickly
large
bubbles
of
carbonation
cling
to
the
side
of
the
glass
like
a
soda
a
malty
smell
is
present
first
sip
reveals
a
brown
sugar
sweet
taste
with
detectable
bitterness
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavor
is
revealed
too
a
great
brew
for
a
winters
night
deep
red

medium
foamy

coffee
and
chocolate

full

nice

and
round
finish
is
clean
and
slightly

aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
a
very
slight
alcohol
bite
in
the
aftertaste
nice
bock
bock
vs
2xbock
this
doesnt
pretend
to
have
the
heavy
malt
of
a
2x
for
a
regular
bock
it
is
hard
to
top
this
one
for
integration
complexity
and
depth
not
a
hammer
class
the
beer
pours
a
deep
clear
garnet
the
color
with
the
head
voluminous
and
light
tan
in
color
the
lace
a
decent
covering
upon
the
glass
nose
is
all
malt
with
a
sweet
hint
of
caramel
start
is
inordinately
sweet
and
the
top
light
finish
is
delicately
dry
benignly
carbonated
leniently
hopped
drinkable
but
a
little
weakwatery
for
this
olde
strong
beer
lover
sweet
and
sticky
raisiny
and
caramelly
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
scale
a
bit
syrupy
beautiful
redbrown
colour
with
nice
offwhite
head
leaves
a
nice
flavour
in
your
mouth
slightly
roasty
and
bitter
altogether
quite
drinkable
id
like
another
soon
dark
brown
and
clear
color
head
is
a
decent
14
inch
for
about
30
seconds
then
a
yellowish
trace
woody
and
chocolatey
smell
taste
is
decently
malty
a
little
too
sweet
some
sense
of
walnut
toffee
and
a
bit
of
a
sweetened
tea
impression
touch
of
twang
at
the
finish
decent
flavor
enhanced
by
aroma
but
too
sweet
and
noncomplex
for
me
the
carbonation
is
on
the
fizzy
side
as
well
this
norwegian
bock
pours
a
deep
amber
hue
with
a
sticky
tan
head
that
lasts
nicely
the
smell
is
rather
nutty
and
presents
a
somewhat
toasted
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
rather
similar
with
the
nutty
malty
flavors
taking
priority
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thinner
than
id
expected
it
wasnt
as
creamy
as
id
imagined
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
wasnt
overly
disappointed
that
i
only
had
one
bottle
of
this
in
the
fridge
thats
not
to
say
it
wasnt
bad
however
for
the
price
i
expected
more
pours
a
frothy
and
sticky
tan
head
over
deep
mahogany
liquid
malty
nose
with
a
tinge
of
sulfur
and
grain
sweet
and
nutty
malt
flavor
is
enhanced
by
sulfur
and
balanced
out
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bittering
hops
creamy
and
good
and
worth
finding
but
the
steep
price
may
make
it
a
onetime
treat
270
aass
bock
beer
deep
almost
opaque
brownred
color
with
a
sweet
aroma
and
very
sweet
taste
long
lasting
aftertaste
of
molasses
which
kind
of
spoiled
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
light
tan
sticky
head
that
dies
pretty
quick
huge
caramel
malt
aromaemm
so
inviting
on
the
palate
you
taste
the
caramel
malts
upfront
small
bit
of
fruitiness
and
toffee
and
almonds
in
the
backgroundvery
nice
sweetness
through
out
the
mouth
feel
is
buttery
smooth
overall
this
brew
very
good
may
be
one
of
the
finest
brews
from
norwaya
must
try
the
abv
in
norway
is
65
this
is
the
best
norwegian
beer
you
can
get
beautiful
very
dark
reddish
brown
colour
moderate
carbonation
complex
aroma
and
flavour
hints
of
spices
oak
and
liqourice
very
well
balanced
great
aftertaste
deep
auburn
color
creaminess
in
aroma
spicy
malt
flavor
slightly
nutty
big
mouthfeel
though
not
too
full
i
was
not
that
impressed
with
this
beer
it
had
decent
sweetness
but
did
not
seem
that
complex
to
me
when
it
warmed
slightly
it
was
better
but
average
overall
almost
as
good
as
their
seasonal
jule
ol
aass
makes
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
and
this
bock
is
a
shining
example
of
the
brewery
lots
of
complexity
smooth
and
delecious
notes
this
is
a
formidable
bock
beer
truly
inspired
and
addictive
to
the
palate
bottle
conditioned
this
pours
a
semiclear
dark
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
the
scent
is
mostly
yeast
and
malts
with
no
prelude
of
what
to
expect
in
the
taste
the
taste
is
a
complex
blend
of
yeast
citrus
malts
and
bread
that
finishes
with
an
ever
so
slight
bitterness
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
making
it
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
it
drinks
smooth
and
has
great
volume
quite
well
made
didnt
think
there
was
as
much
caramel
in
this
thing
as
many
of
the
reviews
mention
it
the
body
and
mouthfeel
seem
to
be
much
lighter
than
a
caramel
reference
just
a
lot
of
pale
malt
and
noble
hops
maybe
a
little
cleanliness
of
the
overall
beer
lets
a
little
warming
alcohol
in
this
poured
out
as
a
brown
color
it
had
a
good
amount
of
clarity
to
it
also
the
head
was
foamy
and
tan
in
color
the
lacing
was
decent
but
nothing
too
sticky
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
malts
on
the
nose
and
gave
off
some
toasted
caramel
notes
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
sweet
and
had
a
nice
lightly
roasted
finish
to
it
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
with
a
good
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
bock
wasnt
too
bad
but
it
wasnt
one
i
needed
to
have
again
overalli
liked
it
it
is
a
very
good
heavy
meal
beer
aroma
was
somewhat
muted
not
as
strong
as
i
would
have
thought
first
impression
was
of
a
slightly
cereal
like
graininess
that
was
mixed
in
with
a
somewhat
earthy
or
grass
like
bite
a
touch
of
some
banana
like
characters
were
noted
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
finish
seemed
to
give
it
a
little
bite
and
helped
to
give
it
that
little
bit
extra
it
needed
to
make
it
stand
out
some
residual
sweetness
left
over
in
the
aftertaste
lingered
around
for
quite
a
few
minutes
before
again
being
replaced
by
that
earthy
malt
flavor
o
i
like
this
beer
i
find
it
to
be
well
balanced
and
a
solid
effort
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
rich
caramel
scent
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
caramel
malt
flavor
along
with
a
lingering
maltiness
and
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
bock
i
love
the
malty
character
its
bold
without
being
over
the
top
o
a
decent
bock
but
nothing
i
would
consider
much
above
average
something
of
a
pedestrian
effort
unfortunately
that
being
said
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
because
it
seems
like
one
of
those
beers
that
could
be
so
much
better
on
tap
gorgeous
pour
with
creamy
thick
head
and
a
glorious
golden
to
amber
color
nose
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
me
with
some
toasty
grain
and
a
faint
hint
of
herbal
hops
palate
offers
a
nice
malt
forward
sweetness
with
light
hops
to
balance
some
dry
bread
crusty
qualities
are
there
and
finishes
like
a
big
spoonful
of
grapenuts
cereal
in
a
good
way
medium
bodied
drinkable
but
also
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
forward
even
within
the
bock
style
thanks
to
grapeshops
for
the
extra
poured
from
12oz
bottle
no
date
stamp
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
glassy
honeycolored
orange
spotty
lace
minimal
watery
head
a
pale
malt
with
a
very
mild
spicy
hop
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
naughty
splash
of
liqueur
alcohol
the
aroma
is
very
light
but
good
a
hint
of
roasted
toffee
flavor
in
the
malt
with
a
conspicuous
layer
of
alcohol
becomes
more
burnt
more
bitter
as
it
warms
pale
malt
blooms
at
bit
at
the
end
a
smooth
buttery
feel
a
mild
sting
on
the
way
down
a
mild
roasted
bock
overall
average
bock
imo
the
body
is
medium
verging
on
full
and
this
is
pretty
robust
theres
a
nice
thick
smoothness
to
it
as
well
the
feel
is
actually
pretty
lush
the
malts
bringing
out
lots
of
smoothness
and
body
and
the
hops
adding
a
touch
of
dryness
that
doesnt
detract
d
overall
a
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
beer
combinations
of
flavors
works
well
together
and
are
well
balanced
and
complex
pretty
drinkable
overall
the
color
was
a
hazy
amber
with
a
golden
hue
with
loads
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
spice
along
with
other
components
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
was
evident
but
upon
the
first
couple
of
sips
i
could
taste
the
roasted
malts
with
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
semisweet
chocolate
coriander
rye
and
a
hint
of
orange
peel
i
think
this
is
a
complex
bock
nicely
balanced
and
a
pleasant
surprise
a
nice
loaner
from
rubby
this
brew
is
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
solid
malt
and
deep
sweet
licorice
and
bayberry
wow
the
flavor
brings
toasted
malt
and
light
licorice
like
the
aroma
suggested
i
get
some
apple
fruit
sweetness
and
maybe
a
hint
of
toasted
almond
very
solid
with
a
solid
medium
body
and
smooth
silky
feel
that
offers
good
drinkability
for
the
style
theres
caramel
and
molasses
to
be
found
drink
at
room
temperature
to
fully
appreciate
this
one
a
great
brew
that
should
win
over
most
bock
fans
not
sure
where
so
many
low
ba
ratings
are
coming
from
on
this
one
i
liked
this
bock
as
much
as
any
ive
ever
had
though
ill
admit
that
this
is
no
typical
bock
mouthfeel
is
a
solid
medium
body
very
chewy
there
isnt
really
anything
wrong
with
this
bock
beer
but
theres
very
little
to
recommend
it
over
your
good
local
offering
for
me
olde
mecklenburg
or
a
fine
german
import
a
pity
but
then
again
i
got
it
on
the
cheap
i
only
paid
4
99
for
six
of
these
and
at
that
price
i
seriously
like
it
if
i
had
paid
more
i
wouldnt
be
so
overwhelmed
but
you
cant
beat
those
numbers
i
noticed
in
a
few
of
the
reviews
people
noted
the
alcohol
was
too
prevalent
i
didnt
get
too
much
at
all
solid
bock
recommend
to
others
drinkability
not
too
bad
overall
a
nice
spring
beer
with
a
great
smell
and
flavor
to
accompany
it
ultimately
the
body
isnt
too
heavy
and
the
oily
nature
of
it
is
the
only
real
downfall
that
i
came
across
with
it
abv
is
fairly
moderate
and
id
feel
pretty
good
about
getting
through
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
on
sale
for
4
99
pours
a
lighter
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
juicy
malt
with
some
toasted
bread
and
caramel
qualities
along
with
green
apples
coconut
and
some
mineraly
and
minty
hops
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
impressive
than
the
aroma
with
some
doughy
bread
notes
upfront
along
with
some
herbal
and
mineraly
hops
ripe
green
apple
a
little
caramel
and
some
booze
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
a
maibock
and
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
due
to
the
abv
red
tail
from
this
brewery
was
once
a
great
beer
about
12
years
ago
but
the
quality
has
slipped
and
all
the
mendocino
beers
have
become
lower
rung
craft
beer
offerings
this
bock
is
sickeningly
sweet
like
drinking
several
table
spoons
of
dark
brown
sugar
in
syrupy
carbonated
water
there
are
some
sharp
flavors
and
a
grainy
mouthfeel
that
recall
some
idea
of
decent
beer
but
just
barely
the
richness
and
slight
sweetness
of
good
bock
is
replaced
here
by
nothing
but
extreme
sweetness
its
tough
to
get
one
down
and
affords
little
reward
for
the
effort
except
the
7
abv
which
may
be
the
best
characteristic
of
this
beer
many
better
bocks
almost
any
other
bock
is
better
are
available
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
really
a
good
beer
despite
that
freaky
vulture
would
definitely
have
another
one
drinkability
is
good
has
plenty
of
flavor
which
some
bock
seem
to
lose
overall
a
decent
domestically
brewed
bock
the
scent
of
this
beer
was
the
highlight
for
me
after
that
it
just
kinda
went
flat
nothing
bad
just
not
much
to
write
home
about
glad
i
tried
it
though
pours
a
slightly
clear
lil
murky
gold
hue
no
head
whatsoever
faint
malty
aromas
definitely
smells
a
like
a
dark
lager
very
pleasing
im
definitely
tasting
more
lager
than
bock
the
caramel
and
sweet
notes
are
there
but
faintly
i
kind
of
feel
like
that
this
is
similar
to
anderson
valleys
crema
cerveza
which
i
love
this
is
definitely
a
great
refreshing
beer
perfect
to
match
with
some
heavy
even
spicy
foods
im
not
quite
sure
it
achieved
what
it
wanted
or
what
i
wanted
from
a
bock
this
is
definitely
somethig
in
between
a
lager
and
bock
d
very
drinkable
great
beer
for
pairing
with
rich
food
also
a
candidate
for
das
boot
d
there
is
a
lot
of
malt
richness
here
and
the
hops
do
a
good
job
balancing
it
out
and
keeping
the
beer
drinkable
unfortunately
it
is
a
bit
rough
and
the
alcohol
shows
through
more
that
i
would
have
expected
it
to
there
is
a
cloying
burnt
toast
character
to
the
malt
in
the
finish
and
the
beer
lacks
the
smooth
and
refined
character
that
i
want
to
see
in
a
good
lager
a
nice
try
but
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
again
wow
a
7
0
brew
and
a
bock
no
less
never
had
a
bock
that
i
havent
enjoyed
until
now
i
see
its
an
hg
bock
lets
give
it
a
whirl
upon
opening
the
bottle
smell
is
indeed
malt
this
smells
like
a
dubbel
or
even
a
tripel
some
very
dry
but
spicy
hops
linger
in
the
background
pours
into
a
pint
with
a
nice
dark
copper
color
and
a
thin
head
that
is
quickly
gone
taste
is
well
wow
sure
this
isnt
a
dubbel
or
a
tripel
very
thick
and
almost
syrupy
sweet
with
only
a
hint
of
dry
hops
in
the
faint
background
i
could
almost
pour
this
on
pancakes
i
think
a
good
offering
a
lager
to
knock
off
the
socks
i
like
it
for
one
but
for
me
too
sweet
for
more
d
good
and
surprising
but
not
great
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
not
much
more
not
a
style
i
tend
to
reach
for
but
a
pretty
decent
beer
d
drinkability
not
on
your
life
or
your
tongue
a
horrible
interpretation
and
struggle
to
finish
a
drain
pour
perhaps
the
best
thing
about
this
was
the
label
that
read
limited
edition
so
it
can
only
offend
and
disappoint
a
limited
amount
of
people
a
great
example
if
anything
will
make
you
a
believer
in
pale
bock
this
will
im
not
sure
what
more
you
could
ask
for
unless
you
dont
like
sweet
beer
give
it
a
try
it
might
grow
on
you
this
is
a
great
brew
if
youre
going
for
one
or
two
but
the
abv
and
the
heavy
flavor
will
kill
it
for
a
session
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
fruity
beers
but
this
one
is
very
rich
malty
and
full
bodied
it
will
stand
against
brown
ales
stouts
and
porters
as
a
meaty
heman
brew
overall
this
beer
is
not
bad
but
it
lacks
any
real
depth
or
nice
rich
flavor
it
is
a
mediocre
beer
that
will
do
in
a
pinch
di
could
see
enjoying
a
few
of
these
from
time
to
time
not
a
classic
or
anything
like
that
but
a
nice
little
bock
that
is
kind
of
a
blend
between
a
tradition
doppelbock
and
regular
maibock
d
a
lovely
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
easy
to
downbut
recommended
in
limited
quantities
to
avoid
quaffing
too
much
very
classically
german
and
balanced
the
key
to
bodacious
brewing
aroma
is
the
high
point
of
this
one
i
wish
some
of
the
fruity
apple
esters
from
the
nose
couldve
carried
over
to
the
palate
drinkability
a
little
too
bitter
i
imagine
some
aging
could
wait
that
out
the
sixer
disappeared
readily
enough
though
pours
a
transparent
amberred
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
soapy
sticking
sweet
candy
apple
caramel
small
whiffs
of
alcohol
toffee
and
subtle
chocolate
sweet
in
flavor
but
quickly
drying
on
the
finish
no
real
bitterness
to
note
very
fruity
and
yeasty
for
the
style
mediumlight
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
bock
from
the
states
d
this
isnt
a
bad
drinking
beer
just
not
what
id
expect
from
a
germanstyle
lager
very
alelike
in
its
character
maybe
i
found
this
too
late
in
the
season
i
cant
find
any
dating
on
the
bottle
im
a
big
fan
of
bocks
and
mendocino
so
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
theres
something
with
the
balance
of
this
beer
that
i
didnt
love
really
nicely
done
with
just
a
little
bit
of
american
attitude
thrown
into
an
otherwise
very
traditional
germanstyle
bock
bier
worth
trying
2009
12oz
served
at
about
55º
pours
a
bright
brown
color
with
hues
of
amber
when
held
to
the
light
thin
white
head
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of
sweet
malts
and
caramel
fill
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
more
syrupy
than
expected
and
actually
pleasant
on
the
palate
tastes
are
of
caramel
and
toasted
grains
with
some
faint
hints
of
weak
coffee
finishes
sweet
and
crisp
very
well
brewed
bock
clean
and
easydrinking
but
hindered
slightly
by
its
somewhat
lofty
7
abv
which
is
not
overly
elevated
but
does
serve
as
a
hindrance
to
quaffing
overall
though
a
superb
example
of
the
maibockhelles
bock
style
and
a
great
refreshing
and
appropriate
brew
for
the
warm
month
that
lends
the
style
its
name
i
say
its
pretty
darn
drinkable
in
fact
it
may
be
my
choice
for
most
drinkable
from
this
brewerey
pretty
tasty
d
too
sweet
for
my
tastebuds
but
not
cloyingly
so
and
not
entirely
unexpected
for
the
style
d
this
bock
is
all
over
the
place
lighter
amber
color
rich
smell
and
robust
tastes
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
and
7
0
male
this
guy
one
hell
of
a
beer
like
most
bock
beers
though
its
drinkability
diminishes
with
each
sip
as
the
malty
sweetness
begins
to
get
overwhelming
drinkable
but
not
well
see
above
mouthfeeldrinkability
really
creamy
very
slick
and
viscous
but
light
in
the
mouth
fantastic
texture
a
great
example
enjoyable
on
this
beautiful
early
spring
day
pretty
solid
and
very
drinkable
stuff
gonna
split
some
hairs
here
and
say
this
seems
to
fit
more
of
the
maibock
style
then
just
bock
drinkability
pretty
good
bock
the
taste
is
similar
nice
raisiny
alcohol
a
bit
spicey
with
bread
bread
crust
herbs
light
toasty
hint
and
light
bitterness
at
the
finish
after
the
sweetness
it
is
moderately
oily
and
full
bodied
with
light
carbonation
giving
a
nice
feel
to
go
along
with
the
taste
profile
d
drinkability
is
excellent
too
getting
hopped
up
on
this
beer
makes
me
feel
good
inside
may
be
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
with
no
real
complexity
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
it
is
pleasant
but
nothing
special
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
could
drink
it
again
but
there
are
so
many
better
bocks
out
there
that
i
wont
be
in
a
hurry
mendocino
bock
is
a
very
clear
light
amber
beer
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fades
it
has
a
slightly
boozy
slightly
sweet
aroma
it
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
smooth
slick
finish
its
a
little
sweet
resiny
grainy
and
funky
yeah
its
a
bock
i
cant
help
but
noticed
that
this
was
actually
brewed
by
the
folks
at
saratoga
there
goes
the
neighborhood
d
pretty
nice
although
nothing
amazing
i
enjoy
the
maltiness
and
this
is
a
solid
allaround
beer
d
i
found
this
highly
drinkable
i
am
enjoying
it
very
much
mendo
brewery
calls
this
a
bock
but
im
thinking
it
fits
the
maibock
category
better
i
first
had
this
on
tap
at
the
tap
room
in
hopland
ca
the
original
location
in
a
brick
building
and
the
first
brewpub
in
california
they
have
just
installed
a
gravity
pump
cask
ale
system
but
sadly
they
had
no
beer
for
it
when
i
was
there
drinkability
while
at
7
alcohol
i
probably
wouldnt
consider
drinking
the
night
away
with
a
sixer
of
this
but
the
flavors
are
most
enjoyable
this
is
a
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
little
brew
abv
is
at
7
but
you
coulda
fooled
me
with
that
fact
im
a
big
fan
of
mendocino
and
will
be
buying
their
brews
for
a
very
long
time
to
come
ill
buy
this
again
overall
ok
i
am
not
a
fan
my
taste
buds
were
pissed
off
after
this
experience
no
head
retention
no
lace
didnt
start
off
very
good
the
smell
was
pretty
good
i
was
intrigued
actually
after
taking
a
sip
it
became
rather
unpleasant
a
7
beer
with
prominent
alcohol
notes
not
good
not
completely
horrible
i
would
not
get
it
again
though
d
this
is
very
tasty
has
a
fresh
quality
about
it
you
dont
really
notice
the
slightly
higher
7
abv
a
decent
brew
but
easily
forgettable
pours
a
light
honey
brown
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
settled
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
is
of
a
honey
doughy
malt
light
apples
and
some
wine
characteristics
the
taste
is
of
buttery
crackers
apple
skin
and
a
nice
earthy
bitter
malt
that
brings
this
brew
to
balance
the
feel
is
slightly
chewy
with
crisp
carbonation
finishes
with
that
earthy
hop
bitterness
a
solid
bock
perhaps
a
touch
oxidized
d
although
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
perhaps
one
of
the
better
bocks
ive
come
across
though
this
will
probably
be
my
only
encounter
with
this
brew
it
is
highly
enjoyable
and
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
should
see
it
i
poured
this
brew
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
had
a
nice
lofty
head
that
was
slightly
tan
colored
the
beer
was
kinda
orange
looking
the
beer
was
sota
fruity
tasting
with
a
distinct
maltiness
to
it
thick
tasting
head
decayed
quicly
but
lacing
was
great
i
would
buy
again
a
pretty
solid
bock
beer
worth
a
try
this
is
the
best
mendocino
beer
ive
had
yet
red
tail
ale
was
pretty
good
eye
of
the
hawk
not
for
me
at
all
the
touch
of
alcohol
again
in
the
taste
not
strong
just
enough
to
get
noticed
these
really
pushes
towards
dopplebock
territory
tasty
malty
sweetness
thats
almost
fruity
mildly
rich
smooth
almost
slick
texture
soft
carbonation
yet
it
all
goes
down
easily
with
enjoyable
lager
feel
and
cleanliness
above
moderate
feel
a
bit
dry
for
my
liking
in
the
end
it
seemed
a
bit
shallow
and
lost
some
of
its
full
body
anyway
it
was
good
and
enjoyable
and
hit
the
spot
tonight
a
pretty
straightforward
brew
caramely
but
with
some
balance
and
booziness
a
nice
enough
sipper
there
are
displays
of
this
stuff
in
more
than
one
place
in
total
wine
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
pours
a
dark
gold
or
amber
color
with
a
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
floral
with
bready
malts
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
caramel
but
most
of
it
is
rather
subtle
mediumbodied
clean
and
refreshing
the
flavor
starts
with
some
caramel
malt
with
hops
staying
in
the
background
it
finishes
with
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
didnt
wow
with
flavor
but
theres
enough
there
to
make
it
a
solid
beer
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
and
in
the
end
i
am
pleased
give
it
a
try
pours
a
three
finger
cream
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
almost
clear
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
hoppy
nose
flavor
is
burnt
caramel
with
a
somewhat
bitter
finish

a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
poured
a
dark
orangecider
like
hue
with
one
finger
head
that
left
a
lace
ring
around
the
glass
springlike
earthy
citric
hops
hit
my
nose
and
were
mixed
with
caramel
and
some
other
light
malts
the
alochol
is
somewhat
noticeable
giving
this
beer
a
little
bit
of
an
edge
and
a
drying
backbite
still
i
thought
it
was
mediumbodied
and
a
mix
between
smooth
and
sticky
as
it
seemed
to
be
a
little
syrupy
good
hop
taste
definitely
some
lemon
peel
and
other
citric
notes
in
the
hops
along
with
caramal
and
something
like
cinammonesque
as
there
was
a
sweet
malt
taste
in
this
beer
not
the
most
complex
bock
out
there
but
it
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
for
most
drinkers
and
i
could
sit
around
and
have
a
couple
of
these
here
and
there
this
was
an
unexpected
find
on
the
shelf
at
winehaus
in
seaside
as
spring
had
turned
to
summer
the
beer
is
a
full
bodied
malty
lager
with
a
goodly
addition
of
hops
dark
gold
with
a
tight
head
and
a
malty
nose
this
beer
is
a
great
take
on
the
style
food
friendly
and
easy
to
drink
i
wish
more
brewers
would
make
maibocks
in
the
spring
as
the
shoulder
season
is
often
ignored
even
though
im
not
doing
handstands
and
cartwheels
mendocino
bock
beer
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
a
brewery
that
is
responsible
for
some
pretty
lousy
beer

at
the
top
of
the
glass
aroma
is
nice
caramel
malt
texture
graininess
toffee
and
just
a
really
nice
robust
aroma
taste
is
got
a
nice
malt
characteristic
some
sweetness
going
through
the
toffee
into
a
really
nice
finish
palate
is
almost
sweet
on
the
lips
nice
ad
malty
bitter
on
the
tongue
and
the
finish
is
this
lingering
malty
sweetness
overall
i
thought
i
wouldnt
like
this
brew
but
im
really
enjoying
it
cheers
drinkability
a
reasonably
respectable
bock
from
dear
old
mendocino
overall
an
excellent
lager
very
flavorful
and
enjoyable
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
to
give
to
someone
you
want
to
bring
into
the
world
of
craft
beers
poured
a
medium
copper
with
a
slight
head
that
dropped
quickly
a
lot
of
rasin
and
plum
in
the
nose
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
full
and
rich
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
bitter
finish
hoppy
but
no
so
much
as
to
overwhelm
the
malt
a
robust
and
pleasing
beer
very
nice
a
smooth
buttery
feel
a
mild
sting
on
the
way
down
a
mild
roasted
bock
not
too
bitter
but
strong
a
solid
beer
this
was
a
decent
little
bock
beer
from
mendocino
that
has
surprisingly
full
flavor
and
a
easy
drinkibility
i
would
imagine
a
couple
of
these
would
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
warm
spring
day

slight

a
good
american
bock
malt
is
focused
and
not
flabby
7
abv
that
you
dont
usually
see
in
an
american
bock
the
aroma
is
fruity
apple
the
taste
is
tart
sour
apple
followed
by
a
bitter
hop
flavoring
the
hop
flavor
is
pretty
bitter
but
not
like
a
standard
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
very
tart
and
has
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
of
this
one
is
one
at
a
time
a
very
nice
beer
and
well
worth
seeking
out
its
been
some
time
since
i
had
a
mendocino
brew
ill
have
to
revisit
this
brewery
drinkability
different
angle
for
a
bock
but
pretty
well
done
flavorful
and
nicely
hopped
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
bock
and
then
maybe
2
or
3
more
mediocore
surprisingly
full
flavored
overall
its
the
bready
caramel
malt
that
dominates
this
beer
however
there
is
a
bit
more
hops
than
a
traditional
bock
but
that
is
fine
with
me
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
seasonal
amber
in
colora
tad
darker
then
i
thought
it
should
be
noble
hop
aromaa
bit
over
done
it
could
use
more
malt
in
the
nose
decent
malt
flavor
with
an
even
balance
of
hop
bitterness
has
a
good
malty
sweetness
across
the
board
with
a
slight
bite
in
the
finish
good
full
body
that
a
heavy
hand
of
malt
provides
very
close
the
almost
buttery
softness
i
have
found
over
in
germany
very
good
and
enjoyable
overall
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
a
maibock
great
looking
rocky
white
head
on
the
pour
plenty
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smells
of
sweet
munich
malts
esthery
yeasts
and
caramel
a
bit
sweet
is
the
only
drawback
very
strong
bock
extremely
dry
and
crisp
on
the
finish
with
few
hops
i
have
always
liked
mendocino
beers
and
was
extremely
satisfied
with
this
one
nice
medium
body
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
despite
the
alcohol
it
loses
points
for
drinkability
because
of
its
general
weirdness
in
my
eyes
but
retains
its
taste
points
for
maintaining
such
a
unique
combination
of
flavors
pours
copper
with
a
thin
white

a
hoppyfruityedge
as
well
some
notes
of
honey
in
the
finish
abv
comes
through
nicely
too
very
good
a
very
solid
drinkiable
bock
good
and
solid
not
one
to
turn
down
poured
into
a
water
goblet
nice
pale
amber
color
with
a
good
foam
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
to
leave
a
thin
ring
for
the
rest
of
the
session
the
smell
is
the
sweet
malt
and
a
faint
alcohol
on
the
nose
a
touch
of
caramel
in
the
aroma
taste
is
a
sweet
caramel
and
a
little
unrefined
sugars
the
body
is
full
and
there
is
a
slick
coating
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
crisp
afterbite
must
be
a
touch
of
hops
this
is
one
that
i
prefer
to
have
a
few
per
sitting
d
drinks
almost
too
smooth
for
a
7abv
bock
what
started
off
promising
ended
up
rather
mediocre
definitely
better
bock
beers
to
be
had
this
time
of
year
the
drinkability
is
good
all
in
all
a
nice
mai
bock
prosit
mk
pretty
much
your
standard
malty
beverage
for
the
spring
not
too
heavy
not
too
flavorless
a
hearty
bock
for
when
it
gets
warmer
i
feel
this
one
is
a
good
example
well
rounded
with
no
off
flavors
certainly
not
shiner
bock
the
king
of
the
macro
bock
recommended
this
is
a
solid
version
in
every
way
its
not
particularly
intricate
nor
complex
just
a
basic
rightonthemoney
rendition
and
i
like
it
more
because
of
that
fact
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
as
well
much
like
the
aroma
the
taste
has
a
good
dose
of
malts
and
caramel
with
a
pleasantly
hop
finish
that
fits
in
perfectly
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
pretty
smooth
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
bock
that
i
enjoyed
i
wouldnt
mind
purchasing
this
one
again
recommended
nice
drinkability
for
a
bock
beer
particularly
if
you
like
them
hoppy
probably
will
get
more
complex
as
this
ages
and
the
hop
tone
down
a
bit
this
is
a
wonderful
imho
take
on
the
traditional
german
bock
style
the
best
americanized
version
i
can
remember
having
in
a
long
time
7
0abv
listed
on
the
bottle
so
a
couple
go
the
distance
for
me
just
wish
i
had
bought
more
im
down
to
about
3
sixes
having
shared
a
few
and
enjoyed
the
rest
d
pretty
good
i
had
to
buy
this
in
a
six
and
i
am
not
sad
about
that
i
look
forward
to
the
other
bottles
d
probably
a
very
good
bock
but
is
borderline
cider
for
my
tastes
a
really
good
complement
to
this
batch
would
be
to
add
belgian
yeast
for
a
golden
belgian
the
yeast
should
offset
the
sweetness
with
some
sour
drinkability
very
drinkable
even
with
a
considerable
amount
of
alcohol
this
very
well
could
be
my
favourite
traditional
bock
out
of
america
this
one
will
have
to
have
a
head
to
head
with
penns
st
nik
bock
for
the
final
verdict
pretty
light
colored
for
a
bock
pretty
bitter
as
well
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
not
overly
true
to
style
with
the
bitter
thing
and
paler
color
going
on
that
said
some
head
and
lace
decent
body
bitter
aftertaste
not
sure
ilike
that
so
much
carbonated
bout
right
not
as
rich
and
malty
as
i
expected
but
rather
it
has
more
noble
hop
characteristics
it
works
though
and
its
a
nice
drinker
and
a
good
solid
brew
all
around
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
pleasant
surprise
thats
certainly
worth
a
try
drinkability
pretty
good
final
note
a
delicious
seasonal
at
a
good
price
get
it
while
you
can
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
poured
a
clear
and
dark
orange
color
with
an
offwhite
head
and
light
lacing
rings
nose
is
of
caramel
malts
and
fruity
and
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
light
bitter
finish
that
overall
ends
up
delivering
a
very
enjoyable
and
quite
drinkable
brew
pandoras
bock
pours
hazy
reddish
chestnut
under
a
thin
off
white
foam
cap
the
nose
and
palate
are
nutty
toasted
malt
bread
and
a
hint
of
caramel
or
kettle
sugars
there
are
no
big
hop
aromas
or
flavors
but
it
finishes
with
an
assertive
hop
bitterness
overall
mouthfeel
and
appearance
need
work
but
the
taste
is
pretty
solid
not
a
world
beater
by
any
means
but
a
decent
beer
that
is
worth
trying
once
o
decent
bock
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
not
a
bock
i
would
go
for
again
thats
for
sure
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
seems
doesnt
seem
as
malty
and
thicker
on
the
palate
compared
to
other
bocks
on
the
other
hand
its
easy
to
drink
and
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
rjt
not
bad
not
much
of
a
comparison
to
german
versions
cant
win
that
race
but
a
very
decent
brew
nice
to
find
a
reasonablypriced
domestic
version
of
the
style
notes
a
tasty
beer
all
around
and
very
good
for
getting
warmed
up
on
a
cool
night
cheers
for
a
beer
thats
said
to
be
over
7
abv
this
brew
went
down
real
smooth
not
one
of
the
more
robust
bocks
out
there
but
defiantly
held
true
to
my
expectations
of
the
style
malt
forward
brew
with
light
complexity
not
offensive
aside
from
the
light
body
and
dark
fruit
character
yeah
its
a
pun
but
at
least
its
not
a
hop
pun
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
midnight
amber
topped
by
a
finger
of
light
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
honeyladen
rye
bread
a
light
hint
of
maple
syrup
and
a
vague
sense
of
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
now
that
bread
is
also
slathered
in
country
crock
nope
no
real
butter
here
folks
and
theres
a
general
feeling
of
mild
greens
mixed
in
here
and
there
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mostly
fluid
feel
overall
an
okay
bock
at
best
one
that
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
at
all
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
average
at
best
example
of
the
style
it
was
pretty
bland
in
most
aspects
and
it
didnt
have
any
of
those
good
bock
flavors
that
i
was
hoping
for
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
but
the
flavors
were
so
bland
that
they
couldnt
hold
my
attention
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
another
one
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
the
only
aspect
of
this
beer
that
was
decent
and
it
was
fairly
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
was
way
too
bland
for
the
style
and
it
wasnt
very
memorable
at
all
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
just
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
let
down
with
this
beer
it
didnt
really
have
any
redeeming
qualitys
this
was
another
average
at
best
beer
from
breckenridge
i
dont
think
i
will
be
taking
too
many
more
chances
on
this
brewery
i
have
yet
to
be
impressed
by
any
of
their
beers
you
guys
need
to
step
your
game
up
o
generally
i
enjoy
breckenridge
but
this
is
a
complete
miss
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
thin
tan
head
good
retention
and
a
nice
lace
aroma
is
of
toasty
fruity
malts
and
sugar
body
is
medium
and
quite
carbonated
taste
is
of
brown
sugar
and
spice
hints
of
hops
in
the
finish
not
awful
but
way
to
sugary
sweet
for
my
taste
overall
a
quaffable
bock
not
much
to
write
home
about
however
o
this
one
wasnt
horrible
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
i
was
however
surprised
that
it
was
7
5
as
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
o
overall
an
average
experience
nothing
is
gonna
jump
out
at
you
visually
aromatically
or
taste
wise
the
beer
sweetens
up
as
it
goes
with
some
toasty
caramel
drinkable
but
with
middle
of
the
road
excitment
factor
single
serving
recommedation
at
first
o
not
a
bad
bock
one
of
the
very
good
ones
i
have
had
maybe
a
top
12
pop
went
the
cap
and
no
ill
came
out
of
the
bottle
instead
i
got
a
fingerandahalf
of
rocky
tawny
head
with
good
retention
on
this
humid
summers
day
color
was
a
deep
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
loads
of
carbonation
in
evidence
nose
had
a
dense
caramel
sweetness
which
was
to
be
expected
i
say
that
as
a
selfavowed
hophead
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
while
malty
and
sweet
was
not
cloying
which
is
something
i
have
encountered
in
this
style
finish
was
actually
tending
towards
dry
suggesting
that
they
really
allowed
the
yeast
to
do
its
job
hence
the
abv
i
like
breckenridge
i
liked
this
beer
although
it
would
not
be
the
first
thing
that
i
would
reach
for
so
i
would
suggest
giving
it
a
try
overall
its
a
good
if
not
average
bock
beer
try
it
out
but
thats
all
i
can
say
never
was
impressed
with
breckenridge
but
this
beer
works
for
what
it
is
3
5
overall
a
very
solid
offering
and
worth
a
revisit
next
season
this
was
a
bit
stronger
than
other
bocks
that
ive
had
too
but
i
didnt
count
that
as
a
negative
one
bottle
of
this
wouldnt
be
enough
to
knock
anyone
out
but
it
will
probably
end
up
being
underwhelming
in
the
end
it
was
too
toasty
for
me
but
like
the
other
breckenridge
beers
that
ive
had
it
stands
up
just
fine
on
its
own
ever
if
nothing
in
particular
stands
out
about
it
it
is
very
drinkable
but
does
not
fit
the
style
in
my
book
this
drinks
very
well
seems
to
be
a
bit
light
on
the
malt
bill
for
the
style
but
i
still
really
like
the
beer
overall
and
wouldnt
have
much
of
a
problem
going
through
a
couple
in
a
row
o
quite
good
for
the
abv
can
be
sessionable
even
if
its
not
meant
to
be
drinkability
its
decent
a
little
better
than
the
victory
i
had
earlier
tonight
overall
another
good
beer
from
breck
solid
malt
flavors
with
great
drinkability
o
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
given
the
scents
but
not
a
bad
beer
overall
im
not
a
huge
bock
drinker
but
id
love
to
see
it
on
tap
to
retry
i
cant
determine
the
freshness
of
the
bottle
as
it
appears
my
review
differs
a
bit
on
flavor
from
some
of
the
others
ive
seen
o
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
it
is
not
horrible
but
is
just
a
little
on
the
bland
side
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
nothing
about
this
beer
stood
out
to
me
it
was
just
above
average
in
every
way
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
malty
caramel
taste
is
the
same
malts
bready
caramel
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
good
quality
beer
o
i
am
a
sap
for
the
name
marketing
does
work
i
havent
been
blown
away
by
any
brecken
ridge
i
have
consumed
though
i
am
nowhere
close
to
having
all
of
them
as
of
yet
this
beer
is
the
same
pleasant
drinkable
but
not
astounding
it
is
a
smooth
bock
with
decent
malt
and
some
hops
there
is
a
burnt
edge
to
the
fruit
i
dont
feel
any
desire
to
buy
it
again
to
wait
until
the
spring
season
with
anticipation
for
it
or
to
horde
it
like
other
beers
i
enjoy
pours

was
faintly

taste
was

smooth

subtle

medium

and
a
creamysmooth
mouthfeel
that
hold
together
well
overall
its
enjoyable
drinkability
personally
bock
never
really
impresses
me
and
this
is
a
typical
bock
experience
it
is
sweet
and
the
flavors
are
muted
it
is
okay
this
is
a
balanced
brew
that
is
enjoyed
as
if
it
isnt
a
7
5
beer
it
tastes
much
smoother
and
is
balanced
well
for
a
bock
of
that
percentage
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
smaller
short
lived
off
white
head
the
smells
are
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
feel
is
medium
taste
is
pretty
good
caramel
and
toffee
slight
hop
bite
nice
amount
of
sweetness
first
sip
is
clean
malty
with
a
sweet
finish
and
low
bitterness
the
off
aromas
that
i
detected
are
not
present
in
the
flavor
at
all
drinks
very
nice
just
a
straightforward
drinkable
bock
alcohol
is
nicely
disguised
o
the
flavor
that
is
here
isnt
bad
but
ultimately
this
is
a
completely
drab
and
forgettable
american
bock
id
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
balanced
which
is
good
i
would
also
call
it
meek
which
is
not
come
on
breckenridge
you
can
do
better
than
this
breckenridge
pandoras
bock
smooth
and
malty
very
similar
to
breckenridges
avalanche
ale
but
a
bit
better
the
body
is
a
dark
cherry
wood
in
color
very
clear
and
has
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
the
head
is
offwhite
fades
as
your
glass
empties
but
laces
well
there
is
a
nice
aroma
to
the
pandora
mostly
malt
but
some
hop
notes
come
through
very
smooth
to
drink
lots
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
to
the
finish
there
is
a
little
bittermetallic
taste
to
the
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
by
breckenridge
overall
this
beer
will
always
have
a
place
on
my
shelf
i
find
it
enjoyable
to
drink
and
the
nostalgia
in
me
will
always
have
an
appreciation
for
it
o
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
special
overall
really
malty
and
delicious
if
the
avb
was
lower
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
nice
new
one
from
breck
pours
an
enticing
deep
copper
color
with
a
one
inch
white
head
that
quietly
fades
out
smells
malty
and
complex
english
a
little
but
wit
a
more
pronounced
hop
vibe
and
some
german
maltiness
too
taste
is
similar
sweet
a
little
like
toffee
a
quantifiable
heaviness
from
all
the
malt
in
the
mouthfeel
keeps
it
from
being
a
great
session
beer
too
heavy
for
me
to
have
many
sits
in
the
gut
at
7
5
its
nice
to
sip
a
few
on
a
chilly
night
poured
out
as
a
deep
amber
color
mostly
brown
in
some
lighting
the
head
was
fizzy
and
tan
in
color
it
didnt
leave
much
retention
or
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
malty
and
fairly
sweet
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
decent
caramel
flavor
mixed
with
some
toasted
malts
giving
the
beer
a
decent
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
typical
i
think
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
overall
this
bock
isnt
too
bad
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
so
i
dont
know
how
it
compares
to
other
bocks
it
is
a
kind
of
one
not
with
the
sweet
malt
aroma
and
taste
decent
enough
but
nothing
spectacular
will
have
to
have
more
of
this
style
to
compare
drinkable
enough
but
not
outstanding
the
bock
taste
of
caramel
in
the
soft
malt
note
up
front
w
slight
pepper
and
mild
toaste
w
hint
of
woody
malt
flavor
there
is
mild
roasted
elements
w
subtle
buttered
toffeelike
sweet
oily
finish
an
overall
goodbetter
than
average
traditional
bock
it
is
a
decent
lager
with
some
nice
malt
flavor
w
higher
than
average
abv
for
the
style
d
rich
and
robust
without
being
complex
a
very
well
done
and
pleasant
drinking
bock
not
over
the
top
and
hides
its
relatively
big
abv
well
a
good
rendition
of
the
style
great
to
see
another
brewer
take
on
this
underrated
style
on
that
continuum
this
is
half
way
between
genny
and
german
that
makes
it
work
its
interesting
and
complex
the
malts
come
through
loud
and
clear
there
is
a
crispness
and
drinkability
i
could
have
two
recommended
if
you
are
looking
for
a
mild
easy
to
drink
bock
d
a
good
but
not
great
bock
its
rare
to
see
an
americanmade
traditional
bock
especially
bottled
so
i
was
excited
to
give
this
a
try
unfortunately
the
character
was
disappointing
and
flat
it
tasted
more
like
an
imperial
version
of
yuengling
there
was
a
clean
smooth
caramel
malt
with
a
hint
of
licorice
and
a
relatively
thin
body
not
a
bad
beer
but
too
simple
poured
this
beer
from
a
bottle
into
a
sniffer
appearance
is
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
brown
tint
to
it
the
head
is
nice
but
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
malty
but
there
is
really
not
much
there
the
crispness
of
the
beer
is
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
the
taste
as
opposed
to
other
reviews
i
didnt
get
much
of
an
alcohol
note
in
the
flavor
to
me
it
starts
with
brown
sugar
and
maple
then
moves
on
to
a
biscuit
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
pretty
average
drinkability
is
also
average
in
my
opinion
this
is
your
run
of
the
mill
bock
it
is
not
exceptional
but
it
is
not
bad
at
all
it
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
hint
of
smoked
wood
and
fruits
the
beer
is
quite
frothy
and
full
of
head
but
is
ok
this
beer
is
decent
the
aroma
is
fairly
average
but
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
ok
they
did
manage
to
get
a
pretty
high
alcohol
content
without
making
it
very
bitter
pretty
enjoyable
but
after
one
of
these
i
would
move
without
looking
back
decent
bock
and
quite
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
really
plays
up
the
oily
astringency
and
the
ramen
is
all
but
prevalent
its
a
terribly
awful
beer
thats
impossible
to
finish
never
never
before
have
i
not
finished
a
beer
that
ive
ordered
at
the
saucer
this
was
the
first
i
never
finished
i
couldnt
tolerate
it
this
beer
is
awful
and
not
worth
your
money
do
not
drink
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
a
little
quirky
in
the
aftertaste
but
overall
not
a
bad
brew
decent
taste
and
not
too
filling
the
quirky
tastes
make
it
a
bit
perplexing
for
me
which
i
like
d
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
pours
a
clear
amber
not
much
of
a
head
flavors
of
malt
caramel
and
light
brown
sugar
this
is
a
lighter
bodied
bock
beer
alcohol
is
not
noticable
i
would
of
thought
this
would
rate
higher
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
at
a
summer
picnic
this
drank
smoothly
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
that
seemed
just
right
even
at
75
i
could
see
drinking
several
pints
of
this
in
a
sitting
a
very
well
crafted
seasonal
offering
from
breckenridge
d
the
average
flavor
profiles
for
a
bock
make
this
a
very
drinkable
however
it
wont
blow
you
away
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
and
be
quite
happy
then
again
i
could
try
something
else
as
well
i
like
the
fact
that
this
is
a
lower
carbonation
beer
for
me
it
makes
it
easier
to
drink
with
food
d
a
beer
that
may
not
be
very
interesting
but
it
drinks
decently
well
for
the
alcohol
content
pours
a
nice
light
brown
with
copper
tinges
and
with
the
slightest
bit
of
head
that
fades
rapidly
nice
crisp
scent
very
malty
and
slightly
deep
with
a
very
nice
lager
aroma
decent
taste
a
nice
semideep
flavor
with
decent
dark
grain
tones
and
a
sweet
finish
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
for
such
a
high
abv
brew
d
meh
ever
since
the
vanilla
porter
its
been
ok
this
is
a
mix
and
match
btw
p
pours
a
bronze
color
with
a
nice
cearmy
head
that
quickly
dicipates
smells
sweet
and
malty
lacing
on
the
glass
but
not
heavy
and
quickly
disappears
not
a
strong
hop
flavor
you
can
taste
some
sweetness
mild
carbination
overall
not
really
a
strong
flvorful
beer
drinkable
but
kind
of
bland
ive
never
had
a
beer
so
similar
to
cocacola
it
looks
like
many
bocks
but
has
very
little
flavor
and
aroma
coke
is
just
as
thin
and
only
a
bit
sweeter
the
hops
are
almost
indetectable
and
im
really
curious
how
this
dark
color
exists
without
much
maltiness
in
the
beer
im
struggling
to
adequately
review
this
beer
because
my
taste
buds
are
struggling
find
some
flavor
its
very
smooth
for
7
5
abv
perhaps
thats
caused
by
all
the
sugars
instead
of
the
herbal
hoppy
aroma
and
breadiness
from
the
malt
i
desired
however
this
is
the
only
bock
i
might
consider
a
panty
dropper
d
good
stuff
not
really
a
session
brew
but
great
for
desert
overall
i
am
unimpressed
with
this
beer
i
have
found
a
general
lack
of
liking
to
breckenridges
products
3
of
the
4
i
have
tried
i
would
never
buy
again
cheers
wow
worlds
above
the
last
bock
i
reviewed
a
few
short
days
ago
d
the
dryness
is
actually
becoming
quite
distracting
to
me
otherwise
its
a
wellbalanced
malty
bock
d
this
was
ok
to
me
but
nothing
more
the
metallic
flavors
in
the
middle
really
detracted
from
the
overall
experience
breckenridge
is
normally
a
good
brewery
but
like
all
breweries
some
beers
are
a
hit
and
some
are
a
miss
i
feel
this
was
a
miss
i
felt
it
was
too
much
like
an
american
macro
lager
pours
a
medium
amber
deep
yet
lear
copper
color
the
head
is
almost
one
finger
thick
but
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
a
rich
toasted
malt
giving
off
scents
of
toasted
bread
caramel
and
some
light
molasses
the
taste
is
a
nice
sweet
bread
the
palate
is
soft
and
syrupy
just
a
great
malt
bill
with
maybe
only
a
dash
of
earthy
hops
to
offset
the
malts
a
little
this
is
an
awesome
bock
and
higly
reccomend
it
pours
deep
and
clear
amber
color
laced
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
light
and
vague
with
subtle
malty
scents
the
flavor
is
somewhat
sweet
and
tart
with
a
full
grainy
flavor
the
light
body
and
high
carbonation
make
this
brew
flow
fast
and
the
finish
fades
quickly
with
a
lingering
sweet
and
tart
flavor
this
beer
is
a
strange
example
of
a
bock
style
and
drinks
much
like
an
american
lager

a

taste
to
it
i
had
a
few
of
these
last
night
before
reviewing
and
as
it
warmed
then
all
it
reminded
me
of
was
tea
beer
or
sometime
like
that
not
bad
a
better
bock

shiner

a
little
too
sweet
for
me
drink
ability

it
just
has

this
one
seemed
to
be
all
over
the
place
i
honestly
expect
more
stability
from
breckenridge
i
was
totally
expecting
to
write
that
i
may
have
gotten
a
bad
or
aging
bottle
but
from
others
reviews
i
am
convinced
that
this
is
just
the
way
the
beer
is
made
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
it
could
perhaps
use
a
bit
more
lagering
time
as
it
seems
like
it
still
might
be
a
bit
green
this
seems
like
it
has
a
good
start
to
the
malt
complexity
that
it
would
need
to
be
great
but
it
is
just
not
integrated
enough
to
really
work
here
pleasantly
suprised
by
this
lager

a
woody
amber

a
silky

nose
has
bready

dark

spicy
yeast
taste
follows
suit
but
lacks
the
same
complexities
powered
by
malt
but
kept
in
balance
by
the
powerfull
yeast
strain
nothing
outstanding
but
rather
a
simple
well
rounded
bock
body
was
over
carbonation
became
watery
as
the

texture
subsided

brec
brews
are
usually
fencesitters
for
me
their
471s
their
oatmeal
stout
even
the
agave
wheat
are
nice
original
beers
i
think
this
one
stands
with
that
crowd
in
breaking
through
the
mediocre
and
attempting
to
break
into
excellence
great
flavor
but
lacking
in
all
other
characteristics
besides
drinkability
d
pretty
good
malts
are
tasty
and
not
overly

it

i
would

and

again
the
foam
was

dissapated
quickly
the
color
was

with
an

the
smell
was
an
aromatic

wheat
a
little
bitter
and
a
toasted

the
taste
had

with

it
was

for
the

was

slight
head
smells
beery
the
first
taste
was
actually
akin
to
vomit
but
it
quickly
subsided
into
a
more
malty
lagerish
flavor
not
sure
what
was
going
on
there
easy
to
drink
but
kind
of
thin
id
prefer
something
german
any
day
of
the
week
d
first
off
i
love
the
name
solid
bock
offering
it
really
is
a
solid
brew
sessionable
and
repeatable
md
light
carbonation
and
decent
mouthfeel
its
just
too
sweet
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
taste
but
by
the
end
i
had
had
enough
its
a
heavy
beer
so
i
dont
know
how
many
you
could
drink
in
an
evening
but
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
case
handy
pours
a
hazy
dark
auburn
color
14
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
yeast
strongly
then
sweet
malt
and
slight
hops
fits
the
style
of
a
bock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
tastes
of
yeast
cleanliness
up
front
then
sweet
malt
and
some
hops
are
noticeable
a
little
watery
overall
nothing
great
but
a
decently
blended
bock
that
is
reasonably
drinkable
d
very
good
bock
in
my
opinion
the
armoa
was
a
little
restrained
but
overall
this
had
a
nice
complex
flavor
with
plenty
of
sweet
malty
goodness
without
becoming
cloying
drinkability
drank
a
little
over
half
then
let
my
drain
have
the
rest
slightly
disappointed
with
pandora
here
this
is
a
beer
that
for
some
reason
name
label
art
the
fact
that
it
was
a
bock
who
knows
i
really
almost
desperately
wanted
to
love
the
look
and
aromas
were
nice
but
everything
else
was
strictly
average
perhaps
i
need
to
taste
this
sidebyside
with
others
of
its
kind
as
im
becoming
increasingly
convinced
that
the
bock
is
an
underappreciated
and
largely
misunderstood
style
i
like
it
more
than
most
bocks
but
id
still
have
a
hard
time
recommending
it
for
any
reason
other
than
sheer
curiosity
a
pleasant
bock
im
not
sure
its
going
to
cause
any
trouble
just
because
i
opened
it
but
you
never
know
shes
unpredictable
that
pandora
this
sticks
on
my
taste
buds
for
a
bit
but
is
not
especially
strong
good
brew
this
is
a
nice
example
of
an
average
and
refreshing
bock
with
no
frills
taste
is
candied
jolly
ranger
applecherry
sweet
syrupy
a
bit
semiclean
towards
the
end
the
old
sock
characteristic
i
usually
get
from
this
style
is
very
weak
here
which
is
good
for
the
style
i
guess
its
ok
im
not
a
fan
nice
clear
burgandy
color
with
a
fiery
glow
to
it
a
very
slight
beige
head
barely
skims
the
surface
of
the
beer
malty
aroma
but
not
too
thick
a
little
raisiny
too
this
is
a
decent
tasting
bock
big
body
close
to
full
chewy
mouthfeel
thick
malty
taste
raisins
figs
and
dates
are
fairly
pronounced
in
the
flavor
profile
almost
a
bread
pudding
feel
to
it
solid
effort
pours
medium
amber
with
contrasting
white
head
nose
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
honey
and
bready
malt
on
the
palate
the
malt
is
noticeable
right
away
but
this
is
a
lighter
bock
than
most
and
the
lighter
bodied
malt
component
fades
into
the
honeyed
finish
alcohol
is
noticed
on
the
finish
also
clean
and
refreshing
good
for
those
who
like
a
lighter
bock
id
recommend
this
as
a
gateway
beer
to
german
style
bocks
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
decent
really
surprised
at
breckenridge
to
put
something
like
this
out
an
easy
drinking
bock
from
breckenridge
good
drinkable
brew
d
a
drinkable
but
uninspired
bock
allow
to
warm
for
better
flavor
and
aroma
but
they
have
better
offerings
overall
nothing
to
spectacular
but
it
seemed
to
fit
my
mood
for
drinking
it
tonight
something
that
i
would
never
say
no
to
d
as
said
above
goes
down
very
smooth
a
nice
session
beer
wow
was
i
disappointed
with
this
brew
this
is
the
first
from
breckenridge
that
i
have
not
liked
i
tried
to
pull
something
from
it
but
couldnt
come
up
with
a
thing
no
real
distinct
aroma
or
flavor
just
bland
boring
reminded
me
of
a
bmc
in
disguise
i
tried
it
along
with
two
friends
none
of
us
could
get
anything
from
it
will
not
buy
this
one
again
ontap
at
flying
saucer
being
a
warm
latewinter
day
i
was
glad
to
see
a
bock
i
havent
tried
served
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
with
a
decent
cream
head
the
aroma
was
some
slight
sweet
malts
the
taste
was
the
crisp
malt
bite
i
expect
in
a
bock
with
a
nice
touch
of
burnt
caramel
the
beer
is
crisp
smooth
and
refreshing
making
it
a
great
spring
beer
this
is
certainly
an
enjoyable
bock
the
taste
is
of
sweet
malty
notes
up
front
followed
by
big
earthy
tones
and
some
tartness
not
as
big
as
in
the
nose
thankfully
but
its
there
and
its
distracting
overall
flavour
is
imho
a
real
mess
too
earthy
too
sweet
not
too
drinkable
im
doubting
whether
i
can
finish
the
bottle
too
bad
because
its
really
a
great
looking
beer
in
the
glass
ie
good
head
retention
and
lacing
no
more
for
me
please
thought
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
available
at
the
brewery
its
not
a
bad
drink
but
not
rely
all
that
super
either
i
made
a
commitment
some
years
ago
to
be
harsher
in
my
criticism
could
i
drink
a
sixer
of
this
yes
but
then
again
i
love
beer
d
i
love
bocks
wont
buy
again
fail
as
a
bock
its
not
a
bock
not
sure
what
it
is
but
its
horrible
as
hell
this
was
an
interesting
beer
it
poured
a
very
nice
clear
copper
color
and
while
it
did
not
have
much
head
it
looked
good
and
it
also
had
a
nice
aroma
however
it
had
one
of
the
strangest
tastes
i
have
had
in
a
beer
first
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
oily
and
it
seemed
to
leave
a
film
in
my
mouth
my
friends
thought
i
was
crazy
but
it
tasted
like
liquid
fried
chicken
it
was
not
a
very
pleasant
taste
thank
goodness
this
taste
was
the
first
taste
when
the
beer
hit
my
mouth
and
dissipated
quickly
the
beer
did
not
have
a
strong
after
taste
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
again
the
beer
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
beer
pours
a
nice
clear
copper
color
a
very
slight
beige
head
barely
skims
the
surface
of
the
beer
no
head
retention
or
lacing
to
it
nose
is
mostly
of
yeast
and
malts
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
to
it
this
is
a
decent
tasting
bock
with
a
relatively
big
body
to
it
taste
is
of
caramel
and
sweet
malts
hops
are
very
very
light
in
the
finish
i
really
had
to
look
for
them
the
beer
finishes
clean
and
crisp
a
little
on
the
dry
side
overall
its
not
an
overly
impressive
bock
but
its
a
drinkable
bock
that
you
could
sit
with
for
an
evening
drinkability
not
so
good
breckenridge
opened
a
beer
that
contained
true
evils
to
be
unleashed
upon
all
mankind
ills
toils
and
even
sickness
and
finally
hope
yes
hope
hope
that
my
next
beer
will
be
far
far
better
eric
a
good
beer
but
despite
being
decent
all
around
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
finish
slightly
acidic
the
beer
is
okay
not
great
but
okay
tastes
of
caramel
malt
followed
by
a
cidery
fruitiness
and
then
an
odd
vegetal
flavor
in
the
finish
the
vegetal
flavor
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
medium
bodied
and
just
plain
weird
tasting
these
flavors
dont
mesh
well
tough
to
get
through
this
one
pass
d
no
thanks
its
not
the
hardest
thing
to
choke
down
but
it
is
rather
offensive
very
disappointing
and
gross
after
the
rather
exquisite
vanilla
porter
d
this
was
an
easy
drinking
bock
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
really
like
the
name
d
seems
like
a
run
of
the
mill
bock
caramel
flavor
is
nice
but
this
beer
is
just
too
sweet
appears
a
pale
copper
hue
with
fine
white
head
decent
retention
going
on
lacing
is
fine
and
scattered
with
each
sip
aromatics
bread
yeast
and
caramel
notes
with
mild
herbal
hops
flavor
sweet
bread
and
caramel
grains
barely
noticeable
hop
flow
but
so
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
an
even
smooth
texture
drinkability
is
okay
but
again
nothing
special
i
bought
this
bottle
at
3
cellars
in
franklin
wi
12oz
brown
bottle
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
poured
a
clear
dark
gold
with
a
thin
off
white
head
nice
maltiness
in
the
aroma
with
a
hint
of
noble
hops
thats
about
as
good
as
it
got
flabby
caramel
malt
flavor
medium
body
some
noble
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
fairly
drinkable
no
defects
just
another
weak
american
attempt
at
a
bock
drinkability
one
of
the
better
bocks
i
have
drank
in
my
young
age
overall
i
really
like
pandoras
bock
i
would
just
like
a
little
more
body
i
think
its
worth
buying
and
enjoying
its
a
rather
cerebral
beer
if
that
makes
any
sense
overall
impression
highly
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
a
brewery
that
has
often
put
out
some
mediocre
beers
hey
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
beautiful
reddishorange
color
little
to
no
head
lovely
bready
malty
taste
a
little
bit
o
hops
in
there
too
theres
really
something
to
be
said
for
these
einbeckstyle
bocks
i
love
a
good
doppel
as
well
but
this
is
such
a
highly
drinkable
alternative
drinks
alright
dryness
kind
of
walks
on
some
of
the
positives
of
this
beer
this
kicks
the
crap
out
of
many
pretend
bocks
shiners
schell
abita
a
few
others
but
there
a
better
out
there
not
sure
what
previous
reviewers
were
drinking
but
it
has
been
a
few
years
since
this
was
reviewed
so
maybe
changes
were
made
a
pretty
average
bock
hazy
orange
in
color
with
nearly
zero
head
aromas
favor
toffee
and
sweet
creamsome
caramel
and
buttery
notes
as
well
a
bit
sticky
and
gooey
in
the
mouth
and
at
the
same
time
rather
dilute
sticky
raisiny
sweetness
provides
a
cloying
note
and
a
not
so
pleasant
fruity
twang
long
cloying
candied
finish
fun
to
try
as
long
as
you
dont
buy
thanks
for
the
freebie
most
gracious
distributer
ive
a
great
repreally
this
was
not
a
bad
brew
but
there
wasnt
complexity
to
it
rather
onedimensional
and
bland
i
have
had
this
one
before
and
thought
that
there
was
a
spiciness
to
it
that
i
enjoyed
i
must
have
been
mistaken
or
drunk
at
the
time
thats
been
known
to
happen
pours
a
nice
crisp
clear
amber
excellent
nose
sweet
maltiness
all
the
way
big
bready
notes
almost
like
coffee
cake
toffee
caramel
really
nice
aroma
very
low
carbonation
creates
a
very
smooth
easy
drinking
moutfeel
almost
a
bit
too
flat
though
not
much
for
hops
in
this
one
a
good
malty
bock
on
the
taste
i
get
mainly
the
coffee
cake
like
bready
notes
pretty
unique
and
i
like
the
flavor
not
an
alltime
great
but
an
enjoyable
bock
nonetheless
on
the
long
long
finish
a
flash
of
bittering
hops
appears
and
then
fades
away
my
biggest
knock
is
the
overflat
mouthfeel
and
the
sweetness
is
almost
cloying
at
times
for
a
regular
bock
dark
copper
color
no
head
and
little
carbonation
dull
caramel
malt
aroma
and
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
decent
body
and
some
malt
back
bone
nice
roasted
caramel
malt
taste
very
smooth
and
drinkable
if
this
had
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
aroma
it
would
be
a
very
good
beer
within
its
style
just
slightly
above
average
enjoyed
from
a
12
oz
bottle
this
most
excellent
bock
from
rivertown
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
a
thick
off
white
soapy
foam
and
clinging
lacing
nose
of
browned
toast
raisin
light
herbal
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malts
flavors
follow
the
nose
with
rich
caramel
and
fresh
bread
like
notes
mixed
with
a
pleasant
nutty
characteristic
and
mild
herbal
hop
in
the
background

the
better

i
have
had
this

and
very

if
the
nose
wasnt
overly
estery
this
definitely
would
have
scored
a
bit
higher
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
drinkability
hmm
just
okay
i
think
maybe
it
would
be
better
with
food
by
itself
nothing
special
and
ive
had
better
bocks
tasty
enough
but
everything
together
leaves
something
to
be
desired
the
metallic
character
really
kills
this
good
toasted
malt
backbone
though
o
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
a
bock
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
has
pretty
good
flavor
while
not
bad
this
beer
needs
a
heftier
mouthfeel
more
carbonation
and
a
little
more
hop
presence
to
stave
off
the
presence
of
the
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
solid
take
on
the
bock
style
and
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
the
style
first
time
i
had
anything
from
rt
drank
5
in
a
row
was
very
tasty
usually
never
drink
that
many
full
flavored
bock
not
overly
sweet
well
balanced
it
had
a
nice
dark
amber
color
slightly
ruby
didnt
pour
it
aggressively
but
it
still
had
a
nice
foamy
head
ok
lacing
will
buy
again
good
job
rivertown
very
much
a
bock
in
our
glasses
and
not
for
much
longer
even
for
its
size
it
presents
itself
as
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
warmth
does
catch
up
after
a
while
a
real
treat
to
run
into
we
can
really
appreciate
the
deft
hands
it
took
to
create
this
malt
bomb
though
the
feel
never
recovers
i
think
rivertown
actually
has
a
decent
beer
of
a
traditional
style
to
tweak
and
improve
upon
tinker
with
the
taste
and
nail
down
the
feel
and
theyll
have
a
pretty
decent
bock
pours
a
clear
goldamber
color
with
a
small
white
head
not
what
i
expected
this
one
to
look
like
aroma
of
toasted
malt
and
dark
fruit
maybe
molasses
flavor
of
sweet
malts
grains
grassy
lightmedium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
grainy
mouthfeel
not
the
best
bock
rivertown
is
starting
to
show
up
in
my
area
so
i
hope
some
of
their
other
offerings
are
better
than
this
one
a
rather
disappointing
offering
from
a
local
brewery
not
bad
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
wont
buy
this
again
it
cannot
even
sit
on
the
same
shelf
as
a
classic
like
hb
maibock
decent
beer
it
satisfied
nice
for
springtime
but
isnt
something
to
go
crazy
about
flavors
need
to
be
enhanced
to
better
show
skill
i
have
seen
from
rivertown
o
i
like
this
bock
because
of
its
different
taste
seems
lighter
that
traditional
bocks
says
it
has
a
7
2
abv
but
there
is
no
alchol
taste
the
fruit
taste
doesnt
appear
until
the
beer
is
12
gone
i
think
ill
have
another
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
one
a
bit
too
sweet
and
i
didnt
like
the
finish
drinkability
not
my
favorite
bock
but
it
drinks
okay
o
overall
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
picking
it
up
regularly
o
havent
had
a
good
beer
yet
from
rivertown
this
one
is
a
good
offering
which
is
exciting
glad
to
have
a
case
of
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
caramelamber
color
with
a
thin
mocha
head
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
of
darker
notes
with
figs
and
dates
caramel
and
molasses
the
taste
follows
suit
and
starts
out
very
sweet
transitions
to
bitter
just
to
balance
and
then
there
is
a
lingering
of
toasty
bready
malt
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
than
i
would
normally
expect
but
the
carbonation
is
almost
perfect
overall
a
drinkable
beer
not
bad
but
not
memorable
either
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
hazy
mahogany
with
a
half
inch
of
white
that
lasts
a
couple
minutes
then
falls
back
into
the
beer
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
malt
but
im
mostly
getting
a
dimethyl
sulfide
corny
smell
which
i
know
can
be
a
problem
with
lagers
the
taste
also
has
a
bit
of
that
dms
taste
and
is
a
little
fruity
as
it
warms
the
malt
and
hints
of
banana
comes
out
after
a
while
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
stinging
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
and
didnt
really
beg
for
another
drink
it
doesnt
look
like
i
had
much
nice
to
say
about
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
that
bad
bock
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
to
start
with
but
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
kind
of
uninteresting
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
the
beer
was
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
not
bad
but
i
think
i
will
pass
on
more
of
this
bock
d
very
drinkable
nice
clean
and
satisfying
drinkability
solid
enough
the
major
aspects
are
pretty
much
what
i
would
expect
and
at
1
70
for
a
bottle
i
feel
the
pricing
is
very
reasonable
for
such
a
solid
yet
largely
unheard
of
as
of
now
beer
the
abv
doesnt
feel
that
big
either
although
i
have
no
idea
what
it
is
and
i
feel
that
i
could
get
through
23
with
little
problem
dark
brown
color
with
nice
khaki
head
and
good
lacing
mild
malt
fruity
smell
but
very
weak
on
flavor
smooth
and
drinkable
but
just
not
much
taste
guess
this
is
why
it
was
retired
i
wish
i
could
explain
the
flavors
and
smells
and
whatnot
but
this
one
does
not
say
anything
to
me
other
then
sam
adams
winter
average
forgettable
but
you
dont
feel
bad
for
drinking
it
easy
drink
to
start
a
night
not
sure
if
true
to
style
but
perfect
on
taste
o
not
my
style
i
find
this
one
too
sweet
reminds
me
of
sweet
corn
with
syrup
a
very
enjoyable
bock
with
a
great
price
tag
o
a
very
richly
flavored
bock
with
a
nice
velvety
finish
a
good
malt
profile
but
it
needs
some
hop
interest
even
for
a
low
hop
style
i
want
something
i
have
had
this
a
few
time
and
at
least
twice
it
was
a
touch
skunky
its
a
decent
beer
but
it
has
a
little
too
much
roast
and
bitterness
for
a
bock
3
55
00
worthy
as
a
spring
beer
and
good
anytime
as
far
as
i
can
say
m
very
smooth
not
much
carbonation
but
i
think
it
is
intentional
heavy
but
very
enjoyable
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
expecting
a
killer
product
that
i
usually
get
from
anchor
the
beer
was
almost
black
and
poured
a
nice
tan
head
that
was
indeed
beautiful
the
beer
also
had
killer
lacing
one
sip
and
my
wife
and
i
instantly
poured
it
out
it
was
terrible
so
bad
i
cannot
tell
you
what
it
tasted
like
cause
i
refused
to
take
another
hit
no
way
will
i
ever
buy
this
again
overall
a
nice
interpretation
of
a
german
bock
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
no
ayinger
celebrator
but
the
beer
very
drinkable
when
comparing
this
lager
to
complex
german
dopplebocks
however
it
comes
off
as
a
bit
lacking
p
s
i
dont
understand
why
the
brothers
rated
it
so
poorly
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
dark
redmahogany
amber
with
a
big
two
finger
finger
khaki
head
with
good
retention
and
pillowy
lacing
nice
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
a
little
earthy
oxidation
flavor
starts
with
caramel
slightly
toaste
malt
dark
fresh
and
dried
friut
tapering
off
to
a
drier
brown
bread
and
toasty
malt
finish
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
light
to
medium
bodied
aroma
and
flavor
are
classic
bock
but
the
flavor
drops
off
to
a
lighter
starker
malt
and
hop
finish
that
are
not
as
well
supported
by
by
the
richer
caramel
malt
flavor
of
the
start
this
is
a
discontinued
variety
and
this
bottle
may
have
some
modest
age
to
it
which
may
have
affected
the
flavor
still
a
nice
but
unremarkable
bock
pleasant
but
not
in
competition
with
the
traditional
ones
still
glad
i
got
to
try
it
before
it
goes
archival
anchor
bock
beer
3
55
o
a
decently
made
bock
but
not
exciting
in
any
way
this
shouldnt
be
old
so
i
think
it
might
be
the
brown
malts
giving
the
hint
of
cardboard
a
solid
option
but
not
one
that
ill
particularly
miss
now
that
its
been
retired
overall
slightly
above
average
and
simple
bock
tasty
but
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
overall
this
beer
is
just
average
it
didnt
wow
me
and
it
didnt
disappoint
me
its
just
average
with
nothing
really
to
it
my
team
is
better
than
this
beer
dark
ruby
red
with
a
brown
tint
colored
an
quarter
inch
thick
layer
of
khaki
colored
foam
caps
off
the
top
brussels
lacing
the
smell
of
a
bit
of
amber
malt
is
faint
the
mouth
is
creamy
and
very
smoothbut
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
i
get
some
amber
malt
on
the
front
of
the
palate
and
then
some
pine
like
hop
bitterness
and
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
on
the
fade
this
is
apparently
the
last
year
this
classic
brew
will
be
produced
a
pity
possibly
my
last
round
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
a
dark
reddish
or
coppery
brown
brew
with
an
outstanding
milkshakethick
tan
head
aroma
is
sublime
and
includes
a
gorgeous
noble
hop
spice
assertive
for
the
style
against
a
caramel
and
boozy
raisin
backdrop
yes
i
detect
some
booze
on
the
nose
which
is
interesting
not
a
super
thick
brew
but
semichewy
with
an
oily
mouthfeel
quite
crisp
and
smooth
tastes
of
caramel
and
brown
bread
with
a
hint
of
molasses
but
the
malts
almost
take
a
back
seat
to
the
spicy
earthy
herbal
hops
with
hints
of
licorice
green
leaf
grape
and
a
noble
floral
perfume
maybe
more
hopping
than
is
typical
for
a
bock
but
it
works
finishes
rather
dry
with
a
sour
malttoffee
aftertaste
and
a
mild
alcohol
burn
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
brew
one
of
the
first
true
craft
beers
i
tried
years
ago
playing
a
funeral
dirge
as
i
type
this
over
the
hills
and
far
away
by
zeppelin
rip
o
an
average
beer
but
not
even
close
to
what
a
bock
should
be
overall
a
solid
take
on
the
style
a
bit
sweet
but
the
right
flavors
are
there
snack
on
some
roasted
salted
pistachios
as
you
sip
this
one
overall
pretty
much
just
an
above
average
beer
i
do
think
if
the
mouthfeel
were
a
bit
thicker
and
some
of
the
bitterness
and
phenolic
characteristics
were
smoother
that
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
still
worth
a
try
o
for
me
this
is
a
nice
bock
im
not
a
fan
of
porters
and
stouts
but
this
stops
short
of
the
for
me
overly
roasted
flavors
of
those
styles
but
it
gives
me
a
nice
brew
to
enjoy
in
cold
weather
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
bit
confused
for
a
bock
narragansetts
is
much
better
o
this
beer
is
quite
an
enigma
i
liked
it
overall
i
recommend
trying
it
and
really
focusing
on
the
different
smells
and
flavors
its
a
trip
o
a
highly
drinkable
bock
not
quite
as
tasty
as
some
but
very
easygoing
a
fine
lunch
or
dinner
beer
went
nicely
with
our
polish
kielbasa
and
potato
salad
also
a
good
session
brew
based
on
other
reviews
i
have
seen
here
mine
may
have
aged
very
well
i
think
ill
see
if
i
can
talk
my
wife
into
drinking
the
last
two
of
the
six
pack
the
feel
is
smooth
at
first
a
little
thick
but
as
with
the
taste
it
disappears
in
a
brashness
overall
a
somewhat
oxidized
odd
interpretation
of
the
style
i
think
a
very
fresh
pour
would
be
much
better
but
as
i
have
it
this
is
a
below
average
bock
that
needs
to
thicken
up
and
get
a
little
heavier
in
flavor
not
a
particularly
great
beer
and
definitely
the
worst
of
the
anchor
beers
i
have
tried
thus
far
sadly
there
is
a
strong
helping
of
roasted
malts
that
could
have
been
toned
down
somewhat
but
the
fruity
undertones
were
pleasant
enough
but
not
enough
to
save
the
beer
as
a
whole
the
verdict
not
bad
there
are
plenty
of
better
bocks
out
there
but
this
one
may
satisfy
you
until
one
of
those
comes
along
i
need
to
go
find
a
real
bock
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
with
a
persistent
burnt
fruit
flavor
that
becomes
distractingly
offputting
not
a
terrible
beer
but
it
has
some
issues
that
prevent
it
from
being
better
than
average
o
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
but
its
certainly
unlike
any
other
bock
ive
tried
in
fact
it
has
so
much
old
alestoutporter
going
on
that
i
feel
like
id
just
as
soon
drink
an
actual
stout
or
porter
it
might
even
be
a
decent
gateway
beer
toward
the
stout
and
porter
either
way
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wont
purchase
any
more
when
i
finish
this
sixpack
moderately
heavy
beer
that
drinks
just
a
tad
slick
at
times
easy
carbonation
this
beer
is
heavy
on
the
chocolate
big
dry
chocolate
powder
makes
up
the
bulk
chalkydry
charred
toast
mild
sugary
sweetness
fleets
through
but
then
finishes
a
bit
muddled
not
sure
if
theye
intent
was
a
dry
roasted
bock
but
thats
what
i
got
not
your
typical
for
the
style
and
not
one
id
revisit
too
often
if
this
is
the
norm
there
is
something
unpleasant
about
this
after
the
promising
initial
taste
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
barons
marketplace
in
san
diego
overall
not
a
bock
that
is
going
to
blow
you
away
nor
would
it
really
offend
you
if
youre
into
the
style
give
it
a
shot
roasted
caramel
coffee
with
raisons
and
some
spice
all
well
balanced
with
a
slight
hop
character
nice
overall
much
more
chocolate
than
expected
which
was
a
nice
shock
well
balanced
and
still
very
drinkable

that
remains

from

easy

great
style
dont
agree
with
bros
this
beer
is
a
solid
hit
75
c
o
rich
and
flavorful
quite
sweet
i
could
take
a
little
more
balance
from
hops
though
a
really
well
done
bock
big
bold
malty
flavors
with
a
pleasant
herbal
hop
character
to
round
it
out
o
it
held
up
surprisingly
well
over
two
years
this
beer
is
most
similar
to
brekles
brown
which
i
do
prefer
to
this
one
the
smell
is
the
nicest
part
of
it
for
me
taste
is
a
little
less
interesting
but
a
good
beer
for
the
abv
overall
starts
off
well
enough
but
that
lemon
sourness
is
a
bit
funky
and
doesnt
necessarily
mesh
with
the
strong
bock
character
this
beer
presents
still
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
and
the
lemon
character
isnt
a
complete
deal
breaker
in
my
index
of
future
buys
id
jot
this
down
in
the
probably
category
o
a
very
pleasant
beer
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
appearance
was
dark
brown
with
a
healthy
tan
head
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
molasses
and
caramel
creamy
and
thick
with
light
carbonation
great
representation
of
the
style
sorry
i
only
bought
one
o
gotta
say
this
was
better
than
i
expected
a
bit
more
hoppybitter
than
necessary
i
would
have
one
again
on
draft
overall
what
a
surprise
i
wasnt
expecting
this
from
anchorbrewing
at
all
it
makes
me
look
foraward
to
spring
it
makes
me
look
forward
to
my
next
bottle
and
i
must
say
that
this
is
a
very
unique
and
distinctly
san
francisco
tasting
beer
it
could
pair
well
with
sea
food
clam
chowder
for
sure
smoked
meats
and
i
could
see
it
going
with
fruit
based
desserts
for
some
odd
reason
o
pretty
bold
for
a
bock
but
i
welcome
it
very
drinkable
and
reasonably
priced
its
not
going
to
the
top
of
my
alltime
favorite
list
but
ill
definitely
pick
up
a
couple
more
the
next
time
im
at
the
store
a
solid
contender
from
a
good
brewery
this
is
a
very
good
beer
slightly
expensive
and
honestly
for
the
price
there
are
some
better
bock
beers
available
do
not
write
this
beer
off
your
list
also
do
not
write
it
on
your
must
have
list
good
and
strong
contender
but
not
as
good
as
the
goat
wants
you
to
think
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
didnt
expect
much
but
to
my
delight
this
was
really
a
good
bock
the
maltiness
was
complex
and
intense
the
dark
fruit
notes
are
most
impressive
but
meshes
well
with
the
caramel
chocolate
and
faint
roast
the
carbonation
was
spot
on
and
the
drinkability
was
smooth
throughout
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
not
sure
why
the
bros
rated
it
as
low
as
they
did
i
kind
of
get
what
hes
saying
but
that
can
be
said
of
so
many
others
i
like
the
style
and
while
it
isnt
the
best
in
class
i
think
its
better
than
some
of
anchors
others
just
wish
there
were
a
higher
abv
pours
an
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
earthy
with
roasted
malt
spice
and
some
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
sour
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
our
special
ale
series
just
without
so
much
of
the
holiday

rjt
wow
this
is
a
delicious
bock
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a

date
of
2fg
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
large
tan
head
which
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
various
malts
toffee
and
caramel
the
feel
is
medium
high
carbonination
even
after
the
massive
head
the
taste
is
good
enough
you
get
a
little
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
roasted
malts
plenty
of
malts
and
caramel
notes
rather
an
interesting
bock
its
decently
drinkable
cheers
o
a
well
balanced
bock
would
drink
again
great
with
cheddar
no
real
complaints
here
just
nothing
to
get
overly
excited
about
a
solid
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stemmed
pilsner
the
beer
is
a
dark
deep
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
tall
foamy
thin
bodied
head
that
starts
around
a
solid
inch
and
settles
into
a
lasting
quarter
of
an
inch
decent
cling
left
behind
as
the
head
settles

over

along

this
one

again
are
present
with
a
touch
of
molasses
bringing
a
dark
and
sugary
touch
to
the
sweetness
very
powerful
on
the
sweet
senses
of
the
palate
and
the
body
and
backbone
is
unable
to
balance
it
out
darkly
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
slick
lingering
cloying
finish
this
one
has
an
overbearing
flavor
profile
that
makes
it
tough
to
drink
en

pours

lighter
carbonation
pretty
good
for
a
bock
but
rather
unremarkable
amongst
the
other
styles
not
a
huge
bock
fan
admittedly
o
this
was
promising
out
of
the
gate
but
became
a
little
too
unbalanced
and
unfocussed
it
has
some
of
the
halmarks
of
a
bock
but
for
some
reason
it
just
doesnt
come
together
enough
a
rare
average
result
from
anchor
overall
dont
mind
it
but
probably
not
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
on
tap
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
the
color
is
quite
dark
like
roasted
chestnuts
but
it
still
lets
a
good
bit
of
light
through
head
is
sort
of
sudsy
with
large
and
tiny
bubbles
that
dissipate
quickly
and
leave
little
to
no
discernable
lacing
i
took
a
strong
whiff
of
this
and
got
almost
nothing
out
of
it
at
first
it
was
served
maybe
a
tad
cold
but
even
with
it
warming
the
smells
were
tough
to
pull
out
of
this
brew
i
was
able
to
get
some
caramel
sugar
and
baked
bread
with
some
orange
rind
hops
in
the
mix
the
taste
was
quite
malt
forward
reminded
me
of
slightly
charred
bread
and
almost
no
caramel
sweetness
there
was
a
bigger
than
expected
hop
profile
as
well
lots
of
citrus
with
a
long
dry
bitter
finish
that
lingers
and
lingers
mouthfeel
was
clean
dry
and
a
little
watery
overall
i
think
the
hops
were
maybe
a
little
too
big
and
took
out
the
malt
backbone
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
not
something
i
would
choose
often
not
sure
why
i
didnt
expect
much
from
anchors
bock
as
i
like
pretty
much
everything
ive
had
from
them
worth
a
try
for
sure
yet
another
welcome
addition
to
alberta
its

good

being
perfectly
appropriate

the

onot
a

definitely
better
bocks
out
there
wouldnt

again
but
dont
regret
trying
it
o
delicious
and
one
of
the
better
of
the
few
bocks
i
can
recall
i
definitely
recommend
you
try
it
overall
i
liked
it
but
it
wasnt
anything
to
get
crazy
over
overall
a
good
representation
of
a
bock
from
anchor
i
enjoyed
the
fig
and
raisin
flavours
in
this
brew
its
nice
to
see
a
variation
of
the
style
definitely
worth
a
go
love
anchor
but
not
a
fan
of
this
one
pretty
good
not
sure
how
this
ranks
among
other
bocks
but
it
goes
down
nicely
the
rich
flavour
makes
it
a
pleasant
brew
to
sip
on
of
an
evening
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
chance
roll
on
summer
overall
just
lacking
and
a
bit
strange
all
around
one
of
my
least
favorite
anchor
products
c
come
now
so
many
harsh
reviews
for
such
a
charming
little
beer
when
was
the
last
time
you
opened
a
bock
that
had
a
sparkling
mahogany
color
and
a
massive
everlasting
orangetinted
head
all
the
malt
you
need
for
the
evening
will
be
in
your
glass
with
the
hops
properly
stuffed
into
the
back
row
with
only
small
handful
allowed
to
poke
up
their
pathetic
little
heads
pleading
for
air
back
i
say
a
mellow
pleasant
springtime
find
stop
with
the
complaining
about
what
this
isnt
and
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
im
normally
not
a
big
bock
fan
myselfi
find
the
characteristic
sweetness
to
be
cloying
more
often
than
notbut
this
bock
is
so
well
balanced
and
has
such
a
delicious
complexity
on
the
back
end
that
i
cant
help
but
laud
it
having
tried
a
large
number
of
anchor
offerings
i
think
its
close
to
criminal
how
their
darker
beers
are
so
overshadowed
by
their
more
widely
available
flagship
brews
this
is
a
bock
that
embraces
porterlike
aspects
and
as
such
moves
right
near
the
top
of
my
bock
list

excellent

this
is
a
decent
bock
and
much
darker
than
im
used
to
this
one
is
kind
of
like
a
porter
brewed
with
lager
yeast
in
my
opinion
its
a
nice
malty
brew
as
the
weather
warms

its
not

favorite

not

tastes
more

very

just
not
getting
the
bock
feel
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
bock
unique
well
balanced
and
tasty
overall
this
a
pretty
tasty
and
interesting
beer
doesnt
taste
like
other
bocks
out
there
but
is
good
in
its
own
right
not
a
strictly
traditional
bock
but
where
it
strays
is
an
improvement
over
most
in
my
opinion
t
lots
of
toasted
malt
day
old
coffee
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
and
some
light
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
with
some
more
malt
it
poured
a
luscious
rubycaramel
color
with
nice
foam

theres
a
sweet
caramelcola
malt
aroma
and
a
rich
maltychocolatycaramel
flavor
to
this
brew
real
pleasing
the
beer
itself
is
wellrounded
and
holds
up
even
as
it
warms
i
could
see
having
this
for
dessert
as
its
substantial
and
filling
without
being
heavy
or
a
malt
bomb
overall
b
overall
this
is
an
understated
subtle
and
rich
bock
excellent
offering
from
anchor
overall
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
it
tastes
very
good
my
only
minor
complaint
about
the
flavor
is
that
it
is
a
little
too
malt
heavy
otherwise
its
a
great
seasonal
beer
that
is
worth
checking
out
it
is
a
decent
bock
beer
but
very
sweet
overall
a
very
nice
bock
oa
nice
bock
one
of
the
best
ive
had
more
proof
that
anchor
has
a
hard
time
making
a
poor
beer
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
anchor
steam
porter
as
well
as
the
christmas
ale
but
this
one
is
just
not
up
to
par
with
the
rest
of
their
brews
this
left
me
with
a
odd
unfavorable
flavor
on
my
pallet
and
i
will
not
purchase
it
again
it
looked
pretty
good
out
of
the
bottle
but
one
whiff
was
enough
to
tell
me
that
it
wasnt
heavy
diacetyl
fake
carameltoffee
and
a
weird
tart
bitterness
on
the
palate
was
more
than
enough
to
turn
me
away
from
this
one
ill
try
another
on
the
chance
that
it
was
a
bad
bottle
but
if
not
this
is
a
truly
unfortunate
beverage
o
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
initially
though
as
i
made
my
way
further
through
it
my
enthusiasm
dropped
off
a
bit
still
a
slightly
above
average
beer
and
recommended
to
try
im
not
a
huge
bock
guy
and
for
me
this
is
as
good
a
a
bick
can
be
pours
the
most
sensationalm
dark
cherrywood
color
with
a
goldenrod
hued
head
all
foamy
and
tall
sticks
around
too
above
the
ruby
glow
smells
like
a
malt
bomb
but
appropriate
for
spring
flavor
is
bitter
and
mildly
alcoholic
behind
a
nice
camamelamber
malt
backbone
it
the
bitterness
hops
at
the
end
or
just
dank
old
malt
hard
to
tell
funky
almost
old
world
british
and
thick
mouthfeel
is
excellent
full
bodied
but
not
filling
creamy
and
as
carbonated
as
it
need
to
be
great
great
bock
i
would
buy
this
one
again
for
sure
damn
notes
very
satisfying
it
was
balanced
and
understated
o
hmmm
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
not
like
other
beers
in
this
style
that
ive
had
but
had
some
redeeming
qualities
for
me
i
liked
the
dark
hefty
feel
at
the
price
point
7
for
a
six
not
a
bad
purchase
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
give
it
a
try
though
you
might
just
like
it
cheers
o
tastes
like
a
souped
up
shwartzbier
rather
than
a
bock
its
good
overall
but
as
a
bock
its
meh
o
a
good
bock
beer
ive
had
many
worse
lagers
anchor
seems
to
make
their
lagers
have
more
characteristics
of
an
ale
than
a
lager
and
that
is
always
good
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
satisfying
but
i
could
only
have
one
in
a
sitting
overall
could
benefit
from
a
little
more
character
and
audacity
of
flavor
malt
is
what
you
see
and
what
you
get
bodyespecially
for
the
alcohol
content
its
quite
thick
and
rich
id
almost
venture
into
syrupy
territory
i
dont
particularly
like
this
but
i
was
tired
when
i
tasted
it
so
that
may
have
been
part
of
it
it
really
is
quite
sweet
and
i
dont
think
i
would
want
it
again
there
are
too
many
other
dark
beers
i
have
liked
more
just
not
my
thing
not
to
say
its
a
bad
beer
though
o
im
conflicted
how
rating
this
beer
while
i
think
it
was
a
good
beer
and
certainly
a
quality
beer
i
just
cant
call
this
a
legitimate
bock
while
it
had
some
characteristics
the
sweet
and
bitter
hop
tastes
make
this
a
hybrid
beer
and
not
a
true
bock
pours

lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
bread
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
fruit
and
bread
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
was
surprised
at
how
onenote
this
one
was
on
the
flavor
and
aroma
but
somehow
it
was
able
to
work
quite
well
the
bready
note
mixed
with
the
dark
fruit
presence
really
worked
well
together
a
definite
must
try
for
any
bock
fan
out
there
and
worth
trying
for
those
who
are
not
overall
for
a
bock
it
feels
like
it
is
just
a
tad
bit
too
boozy
the
extreme
nature
of
the
malts
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
drink
besides
that
alcohol
note
and
the
fact
that
it
only
slightly
resembles
a
true
bock
this
beer
is
very
good
will
pick
it
up
again
some
day
to
me
this
is
a
good
brown
ale
even
though
this
site
calls
it
a
bock
i
dont
pick
up
any
bock
styling
actually
with
the
dubbel
asspect
that
i
tatse
to
me
this
falls
more
inline
with
a
dubbel
overall
i
find
this
a
decent
brew
with
lively
light
flavors
however
its
the
light
part
of
that
sentence
that
gives
me
the
most
pause
while
the
flavors
are
wellbalanced
and
delicious
they
are
also
weak
in
staying
power
and
in
fact
seem
to
fade
quickly
as
the
beer
is
consumed
and
the
tongue
gets
used
to
the
taste
i
would
have
preferred
a
slightly
more
potent
bock
but
do
still
give
this
one
credit
for
its
good
taste
o
this
is
a
nice
bock
beer
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
buy
this
this
is
a
great
looking
brew
that
drinks
very
well
and
has
good
flavors
it
was
a
bit
disappointing
that
the
mouthfeel
ended
up
being
a
bit
thin
though
no
biggie
still
a
very
good
bock
brew
likely
that
im
suffering
from
an
old
bottle
here
but
can
only
review
what
is
in
front
of
me
not
a
good
bock
and
not
a
good
beer
i
likely
wont
finish
the
single
bottle
of
it
that
i
purchased
and
i
rarely
dump
full
flavored
but
not
all
that
heavy
some
old
ale
notes
in
there
burnt
sugar
and
earthy
hops
say
other
reviews
i
can
see
that
i
dont
like
licorice
and
this
is
far
from
other
dunkelbocks
ive
tasted
but
a
good
antidote
to
hop
overdose
o
overall
i
can
see
how
this
one
is
a
little
polarising
but
i
think
it
works
as
quite
a
pleasant
beer
either
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
overall
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
had
this
beer
first
time
i
was
less
than
impressed
probably
because
i
had
several
higher
caliber
beers
that
day
today
i
am
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
that
i
am
not
comparing
to
something
else
which
is
really
important
i
think
when
rating
beers
this
brew
is
not
quite
traditional
or
mindblowing
but
quite
nice
in
its
own
right
well
done
from
a
classic
brewer
who
deserves
more
credit
than
it
receives
in
todays
evergrowing
saturated
market
o
its
alright
not
really
sweet
enough
for
a
bock
as
a
bay
area
native
hate
to
bag
on
anchor
steam
this
is
nowhere
near
their
other
offerings
o
an
interesting
twist
on
dark
bock
with
a
hoppy
background
definitely
a
different
take
of
the
style
overall
kinda
meh
nothing
really
special
a
bit
too
much
on
the
darker
malts
and
not
enough
of
the
wheat
aspects
no
heavy
enough
imo
not
enough
hops
and
that
mouth
sucking
dry
feel
is
just
sooo
icky
overall
its
like
a
barley
wine
and
a
porter
had
a
baby
honestly
i
mightve
rated
it
better
if
it
said
it
was
a
porter
or
something
but
another
style
i
have
never
had
a
bock
like
this
worst
anchor
beer
i
have
had
and
normally
im
a
fan
the
carbonation
makes
this
dark
beer
rather
refreshing
overall
by
far
anchors
worst
poured
into
a
widemouth
tapered
pint
glass
large
fluffyfoamy
head
of
three
fingers
that
leaves
a
nice
creamy
lace
for
the
entire
session
up
front
there
is
a
nice
aroma
of
earthy
hops
and
toffee
the
taste
is
smooth
chocolate
sweet
toffee
and
a
faint
bitterness
of
fresh
earthy
hops
even
notes
of
spruce
or
mint
seems
to
sneak
in
there
the
body
is
medium
along
with
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
that
goes
down
so
smooth
i
do
notice
that
if
you
pick
this
up
in
the
summer
it
loses
that
sparkle
that
makes
it
a
top
spring
release
i
do
have
to
say
that
it
seems
a
bit
off
from
the
style
but
i
still
think
it
is
an
extraordinary
brew
when
fresh
not
one
of
my
favorite
bocks
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
this
beer
after
a
long
day
on
the
tracks
m
creamy
perfect
carbonation
now
i
lean
in
to
find
out
what
else
is
going
on
with
this
one
and
was
quite
surprised
as
to
how
good
this
was
a
rich
creamy
malty
smell
was
coming
off
of
this
one
from
the
very
start
lots
of
roasted
malts
coming
through
with
rich
nutty
tones
as
well
really
quite
good
i
have
to
say
huge
notes
of
caramel
sugar
and
a
touch
of
a
woody
and
earthy
like
quality
as
well
really
a
very
nice
profile
here
and
classic
for
the
style
the
taste
was
fantastic
very
rich
and
creamy
i
was
surprised
at
how
full
the
body
was
on
this
with
a
really
thick
smooth
like
feel
not
the
usual
crispness
you
would
find
but
this
was
superb
nice
carbonation
really
allowed
the
flavors
to
pop
when
you
tasted
it
rich
notes
of
caramel
sugar
and
roasted
malts
just
dominated
the
heck
out
of
this
one
really
mellow
flavors
that
could
be
either
a
sipper
or
a
session
ale
depending
on
your
mood
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
little
bit
thinner
than
id
like
a
bit
of
thickness
would
make
this
just
a
bit
more
robust
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
as
expected
a
pretty
good
bock
from
anchor
not
the
best
ever
but
absolutely
not
worth
turning
down
overall
great
presentation
and
a
decent
example
of
the
style
o
im
glad
my
father
bought
this
so
he
can
expand
his
world
of
beer
he
had
a
sip
of
my
kbs

i
really
enjoyed
the
bock
the
pour
was
really
nice
the
beer
was
a
mahogany
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
on
it
that
lasted
for
the
entire
duration
of
having
it
the
lacing
was
nice
too
the
smell
was
a
little
bit
of
an
odd
one
it
was
big
on
malts
and
some
hops
but
also
had
some
strange
little
sour
aroma
going
on
too
the
taste
was
full
of
grains
malts
and
some
really
nice
hops
that
dry
your
mouth

each
sip
quite

some

flavor
throughout
not
your
typical
bock
but
very
flavorfull
a
very
nice
early
spring
warmer
d
this
was
ok
not
as
good
as
other
anchor
beers
i
might
have
to
give
it
another
try
to
see
what
i
think
overall
a
drinkable
version
of
a
great
style
of
beer
if
you
are
new
to
bocks
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
but
there
are
much
better
bock
beers
out
there
to
be
had
cheers
ill
have
one
of
those
anchor
bocks
please
very
complex
and
hearty
yet
very
drinkable
finish
a
b11
lingers
had
a
powerful
craving
for
a
bock
beer
which
is
unfortunate
because
there
isnt
a
lot
to
choose
from
outside
of
early
spring
not
unlike
a
brown
ale
this
is
a
little
higher
in
alcohol
and
easier
to
drink
than
many
of
the
brown
ales
out
today
nicely
carbonated
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
and
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
a
bready
slightly
bitter
finish
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
imagine
they
would
drink
in
buffalo
around
the
turn
of
the
century
the
type
of
thing
you
can
have
instead
of
lunch
and
then
go
back
to
working
on
the
canal
genessee
makes
a
great
bock
that
i
wish
was
available
all
year
round
but
this
will
do
at
least
until
the
octoberfests
come
out
and
i
can
get
my
malt
fix
drinkability
im
not
real
big
on
bock
beers
but
this
one
is
the
best
bock
i
have
had
thus
far
very
well
balanced
in
all
aspects
very
sessionable
and
worth
a
try
really
a
great
take
on
a
bock
worth
a
sample
drinkability
im
not
too
excited
by
this
beer
its
not
exciting
enough
in
terms
of
taste
to
swallow
this
heavy
brew
would
be
a
very
good
bock
if
not
for
that
offnote
decently
thick
not
much
carbonation
pours
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
tall
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
retention
in
glass
the
aroma
first
hits
with
some
piney
hops
then
is
followed
by
dark
roasted
malts
lots
of
hops
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
moderate
dark
malt
flavor
along
with
a
strong
piney
hop
character
the
body
is
very
thin
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
is
good
d
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
comparing
this
beer
to
others
in
the
anchor
lineup
but
its
closest
cousin
surely
appears
to
be
the
holiday
special
ale
while
that
other
beer
succeeds
by
being
interesting
in
an
offbeat
way
and
in
tune
with
the
festive
season
this
bock
is
found
to
be
lacking
in
key
sensory
areas
most
impressive
is
its
appearance
with
a
darkness
more
commonly
expected
from
a
doppelbock
the
smell
is
entirely
too
onedimensional
and
even
predictable
without
being
enticing
flavors
struggle
to
find
purchase
on
the
palate
but
do
present
themselves
cleanly
overall
in
the
end
it
is
a
mediocre
beer
unmistakably
brewed
by
anchor
and
it
does
pair
well
with
sweet
and
roasted
foods
such
as
roasted
sweet
potatoes
further
investigation
on
this
beer
at
the
anchor
web
site
says
that
this
is
brewed
with
2row
barley
and
wheat
malt
no
more
based
on
the
flavor
characteristics
i
think
theyre
either
leaving
out
that
the
2row
is
highly
kilned
or
the
black
patent
malt
was
skipped
from
the
info
not
sure
where
this
is
brew
is
going
while
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
nothing
really
fits
together
imo
as
far
as
being
a
bock
perhaps
on
a
distant
circle
of
the
style
sort
of
like
the
outer
ring
on
a
dart
board
where
no
points
are
given
but
at
least
it
stuck
somewhere
and
did
not
fall
to
the
floor
d
if
you
love
rich
and
malty
this
one
is
for
you
solid
example
of
the
style
and
another
great
beer
from
a
classic
brewery
d
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
drinkable
bocks
ive
tried
d
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
isnt
as
filling
as
other
types
of
beers
in
the
style
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
spring
seasonals
that
are
readily
available
in
most
areas
i
would
love
to
see
this
become
a
yearround
release
but
its
always
nice
to
have
it
to
look
forward
to
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
think
it
is
very
good
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
style
but
it
is
very
flavorful
and
smooth
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
tasted
very
similar
to
anchors
christmas
ale
maybe
they
use
some
of
the
same
malts
but
i
just
wanted
it
to
be
a
little
more
unique
however
it
is
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
dark
brown
to
black
color
in
appearance
nice
and
clear
as
a
dark
color
can
be
it
had
a
bountiful
offwhite
to
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
toasty
hints
of
alcohol
even
though
it
is
only
5
5
no
detectable
hops
taste
is
rich
and
toasty
carmalized
sugars
but
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
it
is
slightly
dry
with
low
carbonation
all
in
all
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
i
prefer
the
doppelbocks
nice
dark
color
that
approaches
black
with
a
thin
consistent
head
that
lasted
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
would
consider
this
to
be
one
of
anchors
best
offerings
the
alcohol
content
is
modest
which
allows
you
to
enjoy
the
easy
drinking
nature
of
this
bock
has
a
light
mouthfeel
but
not
too
light
leads
to
a
good
drinkibility
would
def
recommend
this
beer
and
all
by
anchor
hits
the
traditional
bock
notes
yet
overall
is
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
and
is
a
little
too
tart
at
times
a
very
enjoyable
bock
especially
during
the
winter
months
mouthfeel
is
great
with
perfect
carbonation
and
that
body
i
was
just
talking
about
drinkability
is
awesome
dont
see
any
end
to
me
drinking
this
if
i
had
a
six
pack
on
me
right
now
love
it
drinkability
incredible
stuff
god
i
hope
anchors
shameful
corporate
sellout
does
not
ruin
its
ability
to
make
awesome
beer
it
has
not
yet
and
lets
hope
it
does
not
pours
out
a
very
dark
mahogany
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
it
has
a
nice
tan
head
with
some
lacing
on
my
glass
the
smell
is
of
sweet
toasty
malts
some
faint
chocolate
and
dark
bready
malts
this
beer
smells
pretty
spot
on
for
a
bock
beer
lots
of
sweet
bready
malts
the
taste
is
big
bready
and
sweet
but
nicely
balanced
by
a
finishing
bitterness
could
be
from
the
dark
roasted
malts
could
be
some
hops
i
am
guessing
the
latter
from
anchor
i
am
somewhat
familiar
with
their
beers
taste
a
lot
like
their
basic
dark
beer
kinda
a
bit
like
the
christmas
ale
minus
all
the
accoutrements
anyway
not
a
huge
bock
fan
more
a
huge
anchor
fan
and
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
i
especially
like
the
back
end
hoppyness
to
give
a
little
more
bitterness
and
balance
away
from
the
sweet
malt
anchor
bock
is
perhaps
not
the
most
authentic
bock
but
a
nice
drinkable
one
nonetheless
pours
a
transparent

a
fluffy

i
liked
this
just
as

as

the

a

can
see

im
in

mood

was
the

of
the
nose
all
in
all
pretty
well
rounded
taste
is
malty
with
medium
sweetness
i
taste
mostly
sweet
caramel
notes
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
then
there
is
a
hops
finish
to
it
it
is
light
bodied
with
a
little
bit
too
much
carbonation
not
very
drinkable
i
could
knock
back
a
couple
of
these
at
most
seems
a
little
too
bland
pours
a
dark
brown
with
light
brown
head
nose
has
fresh
dough
quality
perhaps
from
an
oatmeal
brown
bread
palate
has
medium
sweet
caramel
with
modest
hops
to
balance
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
it
is
very
drinkable
as
far
as
bocks
go
alcohol
is
subdued
or
rather
on
the
low
side
compared
to
many
bocks
ive
sampled
good
beer
could
easily
be
a
session
brew
i
like
all
of
the
anchor
beers
ive
had
and
this
is
no
exception
the
flavor
picks
up
nicely
where
the
aroma
left
off
with
darker
chocolate
and
more
caramel
as
anchor
bock
warms
it
picks
up
some
dark
fruit
qualities
amidst
the
maltiness
near
the
finish
though
a
slight
mineral
sourness
takes
hold
and
is
hard
to
shake
very
ironrich
almost
bloodlike
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
tightlywound
carbonation
level
that
suits
the
medium
body
nicely
all
in
all
this
is
a
flavorful
complex
bock
beer
that
keeps
me
wanting
the
next
sip
might
have
to
stock
up
on
more
before
it
goes
out
of
season
good
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
very
drinkable
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
was
expecting
more
probably
because
i
have
always
been
very
pleased
with
anchors
lineup
i
dont
anticipate
revisiting
this
beer
anytime
soon
i
certainly
wouldnt
purchase
a
6pck
but
i
might
have
this
at
a
bar
if
the
selection
was
limited
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
will
be
moving
on
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
wateriness
somewhat
creamy
up
front
with
medium
effervescence
and
a
nice
malty
aftertaste
with
a
smoky
note
overall
a
good
beer
and
would
willingly
drink
it
again
will
look
for
it
on
tap
to
see
if
it
is
better
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
an
impressive
creamy
tan
head
that
lasts
smells
vaguely
of
dried
fruit
taste
is
super
sweet
caramelized
sugar
up
front
some
cocoa
in
the
middle
and
a
earthy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
decent
nice
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
sweet
beer
but
certainly
not
cloyingly
so
tastes
a
lot
like
a
porter
imo
more
so
than
a
bock
but
either
way
this
is
a
very
good
beer
anchor
bock
is
a
real
brown
sugar
color
almost
the
same
appearance
as
root
beer
the
head
is
simple
yet
a
special
tan
color
when
it
reduced
to
a
film
over
the
top
of
the
beer
it
reminded
me
of
the
coco
mix
in
chocolate
milk
that
just
didnt
quite
mix
in
all
the
way
the
nose
is
real
malty
with
a
hint
of
a
bitter
chocolate
the
bitterness
jumps
out
right
away
but
its
not
overpowering
some
soft
leather
and
burnt
tobacco
sits
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
while
a
gritty
malt
texture
sticks
to
the
top
of
the
mouth
this
will
be
a
great
beer
to
start
the
fall
season
but
its
still
too
hot
in
these
oklahoma
summer
days
at
100
degrees
to
truly
enjoy
this
beer
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
when
it
cools

through
the

taste
maybe
just
a
hint

roast
with

nice
light

hop
finish
medium
bodied
fairl
soft
and
creamy
feel
not
bad
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
bock
definitely
reminded
me
of
anchors
porter
i
like
how
this
brewerys
offerings
have
a
similar
taste
profile
even
across
different
styles
this
beer
is
a
worthy
addition
to
their
lineup
and
provides
a
good
mix
between
drinkability
and
complexity
just
a
solid
bock
not
much
else
to
say
another
well
designed
and
executed
beer
from
anchor
mouthfeel
is
good
and
coating
for
a
fairly
low
abv
brew
fairly
creamy
mid
bodied
the
tinge
of
sour
hurts
this
a
bit
if
the
taste
would
follow
the
nose
closer
this
would
be
potentially
really
good
expectations
were
high
after
a
whif
but
it
was
still
a
solid
american
example
of
the
style
probably
a
good

were
in

interesting
take
on

a
bit

sweet
for

style
imho
notes
nice
job
anchor
as
usual
a
pretty
standard
palette
of
flavors
executed
expertly
by
a
great
brewery
a
great
prototypical
example
of
a
bock
but
dont
expect
anything
exciting
d
its
drinkable
but
not
a
session
beer
for
me
anyway
not
really
a
bock
a
bit
too
little
alcohol
and
maybe
a
bit
too
bitter
according
to
style
but
who
cares
really
still
a
nice
beer
and
very
drinkable
a
bit
overcarbonated
which
mutes
the
flavor
somewhat
still
there
is
plenty
of
solid
sweet
malt
and
some
prune
or
fig
hints
for
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
in
spite
of
the
excess
bubbles
i
like
this
beer
but
if
they
allowed
the
flavor
to
avoid
carbonation
strangulation
it
would
be
divine
a
pleasant
way
to
start
off
the
invite
and
a
pleasant
score
for
anchor
bock
what
will
be
next
in
the
unorganized
invitational
find
out
eh
ive
had
better
the
taste
is
its
main
downfall
it
needs
more
malt
flavor
and
a
little
more
sweetness
its
not
bad
but
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
you
can
do
better
for
the
price
overall
impression
is
lacking
but
dig
abit
deeper
and
it
shows
sum
promise
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
low
head
some
promising
lacing
smell
is
actually
quite
fine
taste
is
damn
muddled
no
balance
aftertaste
for
a
bock
is
frightening
needs
more
taste
more
sweetness
maybe
even
more
hops
but
it
really
needs
more
alcohol
too
a
good
beer
but
overall
abit
disappointing
poured
into
a
glass
mug
chilled
it
pours
a
dark
malty
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
tan
spongy
head
that
seems
to
cling
to
the
glass
nicely
decent
sustainance
aroma
is
mostly
of
brown
sweet
malt
i
get
the
sense
of
a
little
chocolate
malt
there
along
with
some
slight
grass
hoppiness
that
hits
my
nose
as
well
sipping
reveals
a
boasting
malty
flavor
of
some
slight
bakers
chocolate
along
with
some
grassy
notes
from
the
hops
some
slight
vanilla
detected
on
the
initial
sip
along
with
a
nice
smooth
body
very
easy
drinking
carbonation
is
nicely
balanced
and
this
makes
an
awesome
session
brew
thanks
sulldaddy
having
read
quite
a
bit
about
this
beer
it
had
been
on
my
must
try
list
for
quite
a
while
it
was
one
of
the
few
beers
that
held
up
the
the
anticipation
its
a
nice
deep
brown
color
almost
lightcoffee
with
a
thick
tan
head
beautiful
lace
the
aroma
is
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
beer
that
is
the
most
appealing
its
full
of
malt
scents
barley
and
caramel
one
of
the
first
impressions
is
of
high
quality
malted
milk
balls
theres
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
little
grain
its
got
a
little
roasted
character
with
no
fruit
of
malt
in
the
aroma
great
the
flavor
is
complex
sweet
and
satisfying
full
and
satisfying
i
truly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
certainly
seek
it
out
again
overall
its
quite
good
nice
and
big
for
the
style
not
the
easiest
sipper
but
a
good
beer
for
the
style
drinkability
very
drinkable
let
it
flatten
out
a
bit
tho
paid
1
59
for
a
bottle
nice
looking

big

smell
is
strong

roastiness
slight

presence
taste
is
smooth
easy
on
the
palate
with
a
lot
of
flavor
some
roasted

a
bit
of
burnt
coffee
a
lot
of
sweetness
maybe
a
touch
watery
there
is
a
slightly
drying
characteristic
to
this
beer
in
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
right
on
the
money
balances
nicely
with
a
decent
fg
though
i
think
this
couldve
been
a
bit
higher
d
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
with
a
full
flavor
and
smooth
mouthfeel
another
great
offering
from
anchor
overall
i
am
not
one
to
sit
down
with
a
bunch
of
bocks
but
this
one
is
pretty
nice
i
think
it
has
some
very
nice
characteristics
that
gives
it
a
distinct
flavor
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
when
wanting
a
semimild
bock
drinkability
an
above
average
readily
available
american
bock
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
good
body
and
appropriate
carbonation
this
was
certainly
not
what
i
expected
very
enjoyable
however
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
for
me
serve
some
of
this
at
a
backyard
bbq
bock
light
easy
drinking
and
a
decent
beer
but
just
an
ok
bock
this
brew
poured
to
a
brown
color
that
has
mahogany
highlights
had
a
nice
sized
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
highlights
caramel
burnt
sugar
molasses
and
dark
fruit
i
would
imagine
that
i
am
missing
a
bunch
but
what
i
am
picking
up
is
very
enticing
the
taste
highlights
while
are
similar
to
the
aroma
just
come
out
more
and
add
so
much
to
the
experience
the
caramel
molasses
brownburnt
sugar
flavors
come
out
intermingling
in
a
fantastic
brew
at
the
tail
end
a
hop
flavor
is
there
giving
a
slight
but
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
while
a
chocolate
flavor
seems
to
come
and
go
quickly
i
was
actually
not
expecting
all
of
these
flavors
to
come
out
this
brew
really
impresses
me
and
i
cant
believe
that
this
is
my
first
exposure
to
it
the
feel
is
quite
dry
an
excellent
brew
all
around
appearance
is
a
clear
dark
ruby
with
an
extremely
generous
dark
khaki
colored
head
which
remains
well
throughout
lacing
is
very
sticky
around
entire
glass
from
start
to
finish
smell
is
a
bit
weak
but
has
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
and
toasted
nuts
taste
is
a
clean
malt
overtone
with
a
very
fine
hop
finish
more
of
a
toasted
flavor
than
anticipated
but
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
but
has
a
bit
of
a
tingle
to
it
carbonation
seems
to
be
there
quite
a
bit
throughout
but
doesnt
distract
from
this
amazing
bock
if
youre
a
fan
of
bocks
anchor
does
an
amazing
job
of
representing
this
style
of
beer
this
beer
is
the
color
of
gumbo
roux
in
the
jar
and
has
no
real
head
it
has
a
great
nose
of
figs
prunes
plumbs
and
pound
cake
the
taste
is
thin
and
cidery
with
a
little
roastiness
and
a
nice
herbal
hop
bitter
in
the
backend
medwiehgt
mouthfeel
fluffs
up
with
crabonation
d
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
really
good
overall
bock
d
a
rich
flavor
dominates
this
brew
and
due
to
this
quality
i
could
only
drink
this
in
moderation
one
is
good
and
two
would
be
the
limit
nice
complex
flavor
another
fine
effort
by
anchor
really
deep
hued
mahogany
that
looks
near
black
and
not
unlike
their
porter
considering
this
is
a
bock
cloud
like
tight
bubbled
two
fingered
head
from
a
rather
gentle
pour
nice
aroma
is
an
american
twist
in
hops
on
a
german
style
base
the
hops
are
piney
and
citric
but
sweet
malts
are
detectable
inviting
and
very
anchor
taste
is
on
par
stylistically
and
again
a
distinctly
anchor
beer
which
id
say
is
not
unlikely
due
to
the
yeast
its
delicious
but
the
alcohol
is
detectable
very
rose
like
wheat
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
and
the
hops
are
light
but
just
enough
for
me
while
not
at
all
bordering
on
a
sugar
bomb
mouthfeel
is
full
smooth
carbonation
again
characteristic
of
anchor
overall
nothing
to
swoon
over
despite
the
high
scores
unless
you
really
love
this
style
in
which
case
this
is
an
outstanding
musthave
version
d
this
is
a
very
fine
example
of
the
bock
style
its
got
everything
right
where
it
needs
to
be
without
any
extra
bravado
that
might
spoil
the
balance
excellently
drinkable
and
a
staple
for
any
fan
of
the
style
drinkability
not
an
everyday
purchase
for
me
due
to
cost
but
it
was
on
sale
so
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
different
anchor
products
i
definitely
enjoyed
the
six
i
have
had
and
would
look
for
it
again
next
spring
its
hard
to
believe
that
this
beer
is
5
50
abv
as
it
seems
like
a
winter
warmer
at
times
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
taste
of
the
mouthfeel
there
isnt
any
espresso
or
cocoa
here
so
this
goes
down
a
lot
easier
than
any
stout
or
porter
would
this
is
another
great
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
a
shame
that
this
is
the
only
solidly
crafted
bock
that
ive
ever
had
no
matter
the
ones
that
i
have
remaining
in
my
fridge
are
a
more
than
adequate
way
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
this
style
and
to
welcome
in
the
new
season
very
nice
american
bock
tasty
complex
and
fulfilling
you
cant
ask
for
too
much
more
in
a
good
beer
this
goes
down
very
easy
and
at
only
5
5
alcohol
you
can
enjoy
a
few
of
these
which
imo
makes
a
great
session
beer
great
spring
offering
12oz

ok
longevity
and
good

rich
malt
aromas
mixed
with
a
fair
amount
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
big
and
rich
and
malty
with
a
decent
amount
of
roasted
malts
leaving
a
nice
roasted
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
a
very
good
beer
but
imho
too
much
roasted
malts
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
mainly
due
to
the
roasted
falvor
but
a
very
good
beer
none
the
less
pours
a
dark
reddish
coffee
color
with
molasses
highlights
at
the
edges
small
head
that
fades
to
a
collar
rich
aroma
of
creamy
coffee
sweet
malts
and
savory
spice
very
smooth
sumptuous
and
inviting
great
aroma
on
the
palate
the
nose
is
reprised
albeit
with
the
addition
of
a
touch
of
brown
fruit
and
a
slight
highly
complementary
alcohol
burn
very
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
that
is
enough
to
tickle
the
tongue
a
bit
and
keep
things
fresh
but
not
enough
to
fill
the
mouth
and
create
the
sensation
of
greater
weightvolume
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
bock
its
not
over
the
top
just
moderate
weight
abv
and
heftybutnuanced
flavors
pours
a
clear
rubybrown
with
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
leaving
thick
leaves
of
lace
as
it
drinks
down
the
smell
is
wonderful
with
dark
bread
and
orange
peel
dominating
taste
is
roasted
malt
reminiscent
of
dark
bread
followed
by
a
mild
orange
sweetness
and
finished
with
a
bittersweet
almost
chocolate
flavor
very
nicely
flavored
this
is
a
very
drinkable
spring
brew
and
one
that
i
will
continue
to
look
out
for
very
good
beer
although
a
bit
against
the
grain
for
a
bock
poured
with
a
huge
thick
foamy
frothy
tan
head
and
lots
of
lace
opaque
brownish
black
color
very
mild
aroma
not
too
sweet
quite
roasty
a
little
dark
ripe
fruit
and
a
bit
of
an
edge
from
the
acid
of
carbonation
mouth
filling
body
easy
finish
perhaps
a
bit
much
for
a
session
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
dry
roasted
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
has
a
light
malt
sweetness
along
with
some
fruity
yeast
esters
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
toastey
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
is
true
to
style
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
with
good
malt
character
when
i
first
had
this
beer
i
was
unimpressed
it
was
colder
than
it
should
have
been
lacked
head
retention
probably
a
dirty
glass
and
without
releasing
some
of
its
carbonation
twas
a
bit
gassy
and
harsh
on
the
tongue
the
caramel
flavor
was
reduced
or
perhaps
i
should
say
concentrated
as
its
full
breadth
of
character
was
masked
by
the
cold
once
warmed
a
bit
its
wonderful
its
not
quite
traditional
but
quite
nice
in
its
own
right
well
done
and
worth
trying
bottom
line
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
recommend
it
flavor
has
some
characteristic
anchor
elements
to
it
almost
sharp
cleanliness
solid
malt
profile
and
a
subtle
but
well
balanced
hop
bite
the
brew
has
an
almost
bitter
tinge
that
i
find
rather
enjoyable
this
one
is
every
bit
as
drinkable
as
their
other
offerings
nice
and
quenching
quite
sessionable
glad
i
tried
it
this
beer
exhibits
much
of
what
i
like
about
anchors
beers
they
are
always
very
flavorful
and
extremely
clean
a
lot
to
brag
about
and
very
drinkable
looks
very
clear
with
a
tan
loosely
knit
head
retention
a
strong
toasty
malt
character
shows
boldly
in
the
nose
and
flavors
hop
aromas
shadow
the
malts
closely
and
nearly
compete
with
the
grains
simple
without
a
lot
of
muddled
flavors
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
whisp
of
a
finish
hop
flavor
takes
on
grassy
and
pine
notes
and
ride
well
into
the
finish
the
body
is
lighter
than
the
flavors
would
make
you
think
but
again
this
leads
to
good
drikability
the
hops
kick
the
beer
out
of
syle
a
bit
but
then
that
would
not
be
the
anchor
steam
way
but
adds
to
the
crispness
of
the
brew
the
grains
however
do
take
on
chalky
and
astringent
proportions
late
but
does
little
to
interfere
with
the
favorable
qualities
of
the
beer
not
bad
not
overly
impressive
but
certainly
pleasant
i
dont
think
its
tremendously
faithful
to
style
but
its
got
a
sort
of
hoppyschwarzbier
appeal
opinion
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
the
german
bock
category
it
is
pretty
light
and
would
lean
more
toward
an
american
bock
or
maybe
a
dunkel
if
you
put
it
next
to
shiner
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
if
you
put
it
next
to
an
einbecker
urbock
it
falls
way
short
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
i
should
note
that
the
wheat
malt
was
very
noticeable
in
this
beer
i
think
if
they
cut
back
on
it
a
bit
it
would
be
a
much
more
enjoyable
brew
but
still
a
decent
option
if
you
see
it
around
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
aggressive
carbonation
that
lashes
the
tongue
right
at
the
outset
is
quickly
subdued
replaced
with
a
creamy
and
mouthfilling
experience
that
really
lets
this
beer
open
up
by
the
time
this
bottle
is
near
complete
its
a
dream
lush
and
beautifully
full
for
this
quirky
style
its
quite
hoppy
in
the
finish
yet
retrained
in
strength
enough
to
have
more
than
one
and
not
be
set
back
by
its
sweetness
an
interesting
american
example
of
a
bock
overall
impression
interesting
a
bit
different
than
i
would
expect
from
a
bock
but
still
a
drinkable
and
interesting
example
full
creamy
mouthfeel
emphasizes
the
positive
attributes
of
the
beer
allowing
it
to
spread
across
the
palate
evenly
an
aboveaverage
satisfying
bock
id
have
another
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
d
overall
very
plesant
and
quite
drinkable
for
a
richly
flavored
beer
from
safeway
in
eureka
ca
this
one
set
me
back
8
99
so
i
was
hoping
for
something
worth
the
price
poured
a
very
rich
and
dark
red
to
brown
with
a
nice
fat
tan
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
and
left
good
lacing
in
the
glass
nose
of
malts
caramel
chocolate
and
fruits
mouthfeel
is
fairly
rich
and
creamy
and
flavors
are
bitter
malts
caramel
and
hops
finish
slightly
bitter
this
is
a
well
balanced
brew
worth
the
price
d
the
bitterness
at
the
finish
balances
the
dry
malt
flavors
nicely
with
a
good
complexity
that
really
comes
through
when
it
warms
and
a
very
light
sweetness
in
the
background
that
adds
depth
one
of
the
better
bocks
i
have
tried
on
tap
at
coles
tonightcame
to
the
table
a
deep
ruddy
brown
with
a
thinner
but
tight
almond
colored
head
roasted
aromas
like
that
of
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
maltflavors
are
on
the
drier
side
quite
earthy
and
roasted
the
healthy
dose
of
hops
provide
a
drier
earthy
almost
spicey
feel
to
the
beer
an
underlying
molasseslike
sweetness
comes
thru
but
the
dry
earthy
tones
prevail
a
different
sort
of
bock
in
my
mind
one
with
an
american
hopped
up
twist
with
its
drier
earthy
character
but
quite
nice
it
is
a
little
different
for
the
style
but
something
i
quite
enjoyed
and
will
do
so
in
the
future
a
bland
bock
stylistically
the
rich
and
creamy
malt
flavors
seem
to
fade
rather
quickly
leaving
the
airy
wheat
taste
that
does
nothing
for
this

a
sixer

for
us
midwesterners
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
mahogany
color
with
a
bit
of
ruby
highlights
and
a
very
thick
meringuelike
head
that
rises
an
inch
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
with
no
spillage
a
very
lovely
looking
beer
nose
is
chocolaty
malt
buttery
pecan
and
toasted
walnuts
along
with
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
malt
dominates
the
taste
with
a
semisweet
dark
chocolate
flavor
the
nuttiness
that
was
in
the
aroma
is
much
more
subdued
in
the
taste
but
there
are
additional
fruity
notes
of
fig
dates
and
prunes
a
drying
bitterness
comes
across
in
the
finish
to
cleanse
the
palate
before
the
next
sip
highly
enjoyablei
will
be
buying
more
very
soon

not
bad
from
the
website
bock
has
come
to
mean
a
beer
darker
and
stronger
than
the
brewerys
regular
brew

agreed
however
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
an
improvement
on
their
porter
which
is
truly
top
notch
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
anchor
should
make
a
meatier
brew
for
their

i
could

this
all

overall
i
could
see
drinking
a
six
of
this
in
one
night
alot
better
than
other
bocks
available
in
this
area
and
a
great
addition
to
anchors
offerings
another
solid
brew
from
the
amazing
anchor
brewery
i
first
had
this
last
year
at
the
brewery
tour
and
this
years
version
tastes
just
as
good
as
i
remember
cheers
recommended
d
not
bad
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
again
this
beer
brings
to
mind
a
story
attributed
to
charles
kuralt
about
the
stength
of
coffee
as
one
travels
west
in
the
u
s
seems
the
pioneers
reused
their
coffee
grounds
as
they
headed
westward
therefore
the
strength
of
the
coffee
even
today
seems
to
dissipate
as
one
travels
west
through
the
country
my
point
being
that
it
appears
the
bock
style
here
has
tranformed
accordingly
en
route
westward
to
san
francisco
taking
on
some
of
the
west
coast
philosophies
in
lieu
of
the
typical
german
bock
profile
md
smooth
and
sweet
with
well
balanced
bitterness
an
easy
down
bock
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
anchor
upholds
their
steeped
tradition
of
world
class
beers
well
done
anchor
i
dont
know
what
to
think
about
this
beer
it
seems
too
dark
to
be
a
bock
seems
more
like
a
dopplebock
or
something
its
still
a
delicious
beer
no
matter
what
category
you
put
it
in
looks
more
like
a
stout
than
a
bock
but
still
maintains
very
deep
brown
red
hue
cant
see
any
bubbles
but
has
a
good
ring
of
foam
after
the
pour
very
light
and
asymetrical
lacing
good
dark
looking
bock
the
aroma
makes
me
think
of
a
true
german
bock
but
with
some
stronger
hop
influence
toatlly
awesome
and
different
i
smell
malty
blankets
of
yeast
and
barn
yard
with
a
bunch
of
intermingling
bitterness
and
roasted
malts
great
balance
the
taste
is
just
as
unique
very
malty
and
roasty
but
not
high
in
the
fruity
malts
that
im
used
to
in
most
bocks
a
little
dry
roasted
mlats
with
a
few
hints
of
dried
prunes
and
apricots
but
then
some
medium
bitterness
mixes
with
the
fruits
and
the
mlats
very
different
this
is
an
awesome
session
beer
i
wish
i
didnt
have
to
go
to
indy
to
get
this
stuff
drinks
alright
just
too
many
non
conventional
bock
flavors
in
this
critter
almost
makes
think
of
their
holiday
ale
if
youre
not
too
anal
about
taste
profiles
this
aint
a
bad
beer
but
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
anchor
pours
out
a
rich
looking
purplish
ruby
colored
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
nose
is
toasty
and
of
caramelized
malts
with
a
healthy
amount
of
herbal
hops
starts
off
with
caramel
and
a
sort
of
thin
malt
body
which
leads
into
a
middle
of
herbal
hops
and
their
bitterness
finishes
a
bit
too
roasty
for
me
and
kind
of
lactic
dry
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
for
me
solid
drinkability
despite
its
flaws
i
would
drink
this
again
but
when
faced
with
the
price
of
a
6
of
anchor
beer
ill
stick
to
liberty
steam
or
old
foghorn
solid
but
nothing
wowing
despite
all
the
strong
flavours
this
one
was
surprisingly
drinkable
pours
a
very
dark
clear
rubymahogony
with
a
huge
tan
foamy
head
the
head
looks
guiness
like
with
great
lacing
the
smell
is
light
with
dark
fruit
aromas
and
coffee
the
taste
is
very
stout
like
with
coffeesome
chocolatedark
fruit
and
bitter
hops
the
mf
is
light
with
all
flavors
mixing
well
makes
this
a
pretty
decent
beer
from
a
great
brewery
pours
a
deep
orangebrown
color
topped
by
a
small
light
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
coating
aroma
of
very
sweet
lightly
roasted
malt
and
some
mildly
fruity
hops
palate
is
sweet
dark
malt
up
front
calling
up
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
an
off
flavor
of
mild
diacetyl
peeks
through
now
and
again
but
is
not
overwhelming
finish
is
sweet
and
bready
body
is
a
little
thin
like
a
decent
bock
should
be
not
my
favorite
bock
or
my
favorite
anchor
offering
but
a
decent
effort
beer
poured
very
dark
with
ruby
undertones
the
head
is
brown
and
very
sturdy
nose
is
primarily
sweet
malts
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
very
malty
somewhat
sweet
with
some
hints
of
that
dark
fruit
finish
is
with
a
very
dry
but
light
hop
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
mellow
the
beer
goes
down
nice
and
easy
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
that
has
a
degree
of
complexity
that
is
very
interesting
pretty
drinkable
though
im
not
sure
the
flavors
suit
me
well
enough
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
thin
along
the
palate
and
astringent
drinkability
wont
be
the
last
time
this
one
goes
down
for
sure
a
winner
from
a
pioneer
of
the
microbrew
phenomenon
we
are
thankfully
privy
to
not
a
halfbad
boch
here
the
flavors
start
out
somewhat
dissapointing
in
the
beginning
of
a
taste
but
toward
the
middle
and
finish
they
come
through
nicely
a
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
helps
this
beer
as
well
recommended
mouth
is
lightly
carbonated
and
thick
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
indeed
taste
plenty
of
malt
body
and
well
dosed
carbonation
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
vegetal
taste
to
it
but
i
didnt
really
see
it
as
such
a
bad
thing
kind
of
like
bitter
rhubarb
and
the
malt
sweetness
tames
the
harshness
of
it
but
its
the
finish
that
i
didnt
like
as
it
was
ashy
something
i
dont
like
at
all
at
least
not
at
this
level
pours
a
five
finger
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
opaque
blackbrown
color
light
carbonation
and
mediumheavy
bodied
molasses
nose
starts
with
a
roasted
chocolateburnt
oak
flavor
finish
is
dry
bitter
chocolate
really
this
is
a
bock
with
balls
1
55
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
liquid
solutions
tigard
or
d
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
bock
from
anchor
recommend
for
sure
this
is
really
worth
a
try
seems
like
a
versatile
food
beer
too
i
bet
it
would
be
great
with
something
involving
bacon
and
mushrooms
taste
was
roasted
and
dry
nothing
like
the
sweet
smell
just
dry
the
dark
malts
give
the
beer
a
good
maltbitter
and
there
is
a
good
hopbitter
in
there
too
the
special
malts
really
add
to
the
taste
giving
ot
complexity
and
body
which
is
medium
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
true
bockbeer
according
to
the
guidelines
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
rendition
of
this
style
give
it
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
pours
very
dark
nearly
opaque
blackbrown
medium
head
of
hearty
brown
bubbles
aroma
is
of
caramelized
malt
taste
follows
suit
medium
body
on
the
light
side
for
the
style
nice
roasted
grain
quality
to
cut
the
sweetness
roasted
quality
comes
out
even
more
in
the
after
taste
a
bit
dry
for
a
bock
well
made
and
well
balanced
bock
easy
to
drink
and
looks
great
in
the
glass
even
at
the
end
of
this
review
i
am
still
unsure
where
bocks
fit
into
the
whole
scheme
of
things
i
try
to
put
brews
into
a
roygbiv
spectrum
of
the
rainbow
in
my
mind
where
styles
overlap
in
shades
and
blend
into
the
next
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
still
cant
place
bocks
my
best
guess
would
be
somewhere
between
porters
and
abbot
ales
the
closest
thing
i
have
had
to
this
is
stepan
razin
porter
which
makes
me
believe
stepan
razin
isnt
really
a
porter
which
i
have
always
felt
maybe
its
just
labeled
as
such
for
the
us
market
i
am
setting
my
sights
on
figuring
this
style
out
it
wont
be
long
before
i
try
it
again
pretty
drinkable
for
a
bock
the
dryness
avoids
any
lingering
sticky
feel
and
makes
this
quite
sessionable
i
havent
had
a
great
deal
of
bock
experience
but
i
recognize
quality
beer
when
i
taste
it
anchor
bock
is
a
truly
wonderful
effort
from
a
brewery
that
specializes
in
brewing
gold
standards
and
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
of
the
style
drinkability
is
very
high
every
thing
here
leads
you
to
want
another
mk
on
tap
at
anchor
brewing
during
a
recent
tour
great
overall
taste
on
this
one
great
beer
its
a
newer
beer
for
them
and
they
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
not
as
heavy
or
sweet
as
their
barleywine
but
just
as
enjoyable
to
drink
recommended
to
anyone
wanting
a
slightly
thicker
more
complex
darker
beer
i
am
not
necessarily
a
big
fan
of
the
bock
style
in
general
but
this
is
quite
tasty
i
like
it
anchors
dark
beers
have
been
appearing
on
my
table
at
christmas
dinner
for
some
years
now
this
one
pours
with
thick
creamy
foam
brownish
in
color
the
color
of
the
beer
is
reddish
dark
brown
smelling
sweet
with
hints
of
fruits
and
coffee
the
taste
is
bitter
with
roasted
hops
and
bubblegum
it
almost
has
a
powderlike
mouthfeel
it
definately
measures
up
to
anchor
quality
although
the
tastes
could
be
a
bit
more
pronounced
this
is
a
decent
bock
wouldnt
be
a
first
choice
but
highly
drinkable
the
look
was
kind
of
blah
but
beginning
at
the
aroma
it
redeemed
itself
nicely
carrying
a
flavor
that
seems
dependable
and
lipsmacking
good
i
had
one
but
had
i
not
had
kids
in
tow
i
would
gladly
have
had
another
and
it
would
have
been
every
bit
as
good
as
the
first
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
bock
season
a
joy
its
basic
but
fairly
complex
and
goes
down
smooth
and
mellow
thats
a
fine
springtime
scenario
never
did
see
this
on
the
east
coast
nor
had
i
really
known
about
it
so
i
had
to
grab
a
bottle
of
this
upon
finding
it
in
ca
crimson
brown
with
a
well
held
tan
head
spicy
nose
hints
at
plums
and
licorice
flavor
is
really
toasty
with
very
nice
complexity
subtle
coffee
plums
an
enormous
chewy
malt
profile
and
a
fair
smattering
of
hops
on
the
palate
make
this
one
interesting
brew
kind
of
reminds
me
of
their
osa
without
the
pinespruce
element
but
still
has
a
flavor
profile
all
its
own
extremely
drinkable
at
5
5
as
well
id
be
happy
drinking
stein
after
giant
stein
of
this
one
d
i
see
this
as
a
nice
to
try
every
season
it
comes
around
i
dont
plan
on
stocking
it
in
my
fridge
awesome
play
on
the
bock

sweet
with
the
prune
and
dates
really
showing
through
finish
is
initially
very
sweet
but
a
pleasant
hoppy
bitterness
begins
to
assert
itself
a
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
is
the
perfect
ending
for
this
beer
great
drinkability
really
a
winner
upon
the
beers
disemboguing
the
12ounce
stubby
bottle
a
deep
chocolate
brown
with
a
massive
creamy
dark

so
slowly
erodes

good

the
top
moderate

is
lightly
acidic
the

pleasant
in
the
spiciness
very
dry

a
throwback
to
the

taste
is

maltiness
up

with
a
mild
alcohol
kick
midsip
and
an
ever
so
slight
hop
bitterness
this
beer
finishes
very
indeed
nothing
lingering
afterwards
very
nice
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
one
beer
that
will
have
me
trying
a
few
others
very
drinkable
put
it
all
together
and
you
got
yourself
one
swell
bock
delicious
enough
to
sip
but
not
too
strong
that
you
have
to
sip
drinkability
pair
this
with
figs
or
fig
newtons
it
really
brings
out
the
chocolate
and
rum
flavors
beautifully
dark
coffee
color
with
red
hues
as
you
can
see
through
it
in
the
light
revealing
nice
clarity
the
slim
head
doesnt
last
long
at
all
and
leaves
a
very
faint
ring
in
its
wake
aroma
of
tangy
brown
malt
sweet
with
licorice
nut
and
brown
sugar
notes
flavor
is
of
clean
nutty
sweet
malt
slightly
tangy
in
the
finish
there
is
a
slight
roasted
character
present
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
cherries
mouthfeel
is
decent
medium
thick
adequate
carbonation
this
is
fairly
mild
with
solid
clean
flavors
for
a
darker
beer
making
it
an
excellent
choice
for
a
session
ale
another
fine
offering
from

the

some
clumpy
lacing
rich

sweet
aroma
with
caramel
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
character
also
mild
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
hops
theres
a
hint
of
roast
that
adds
to
these
qualities
in
the
flavour
along
with
a
bit
of
toffee
and
apple
core
light
lingering
bitterness
and
malt
the
body
was
a
little
lighter
than
expected
but
certainly
not
approaching
thin
fairly
dry
with
low
carbonation
one
that
id
definitely
give
another
try
thanks
hogtownharry
if
you
dont
like
chocolate
under
no
circumstances
try
this
beer
you
will
hate
it
this
is
classed
as
a
bock
but
it
is
much
like
a
thicker
and
heartier
version
of
anchors
christmas
beer
to
me
this
is
really
a
milk
stout
and
a
damn
good
one
too
i
wont
quibble
about
the
adherence
to
style
which
this
doesnt
really
do
this
is
simply
a
damn
tasty
beer
mahogony
colour
with
mocha
head
lots
of

and
chocolate

aroma
creamy
and
tongue
tingle

and

aftertaste
with

all
works
together
and
would

of
flavor
with
a
nice
texture
its
sweet
and
mostly
to
style
very
tasty
though
it
is
a
bit
low
in
abv
for
a
bock
no
matter
this
is
a
tasty
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
creaminess
and
good
carbonation
fills
the
mouth
nicely
and
satisfies
the
beer
craving
without
incident
this
is
a
bock
id
look
for
more
often
if
it
was
available
hopefully
anchor
will
put
this
out
again
with
wider
distribution
another
feather
in
the
cap
of
one
of
the
original
microbrewers
thanks
to
irishsnake
for
the
opportunity
overall
i
had
heard
and
read
of
this
only
6
or
so
months
ago
but
it
seems
that
it
does
not
travel
far
from
its
home
turf
up
in
the
wilds
of
the
west
coast
bay
area
either
that
or
it
is
a
limited
offering
i
actually
snagged
this
flasche
at
bottle
barn
santa
rosa
for
just
2
59
pretty
good
value
and
a
nice
brew
despite
warnings
from
one
of
my
highly
respected
fellow
bas
i
quite
enjoyed
this
pours
a
dark
coke
colour
with
a
creamy
tan
head
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
body
is
light
very
nice
bock
sweet
caramel
coffee
roasted
flavours
a
good
amount
of
firm
hoppy
bitterness
very
drinkable
overall
a
great
beer
to
quaff
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
wonderful
bock
imo
warm
and
comforting
in
the
mouth
easily
drinkable
tenaciously
tasty
i
like
it
i
like
it
good
roast
for
a
bock
id
like
to
have
this
again
and
again
very
smooth
and
luscious
on
the
palate
an
expertly
brewed
bock
drinkability
may
have
been
better
fresh
no
off
flavors
or
alcohol
noted
nice
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
probably
wouldnt
consider
revisiting
i
was
quite
fond
of
this
one
and
it
is
so
rare
too
i
found
it
at
bevmo
in
berkeley
when
i
visisted
and
am
happy
to
have
picked
it
up
like
wetcoaster
i
was
surprise
to
see
this
offered
at
my
local
whole
foods
market
didnt
know
anchor
made
a
bock
my
only
previous
experience
with
the
style
was
the
in
my
opinion
vastly
overrated
celebrator
still
i
decided
to
try
it
deep
copper
color
was
topped
by
a
tan
head
that
displayed
excellent
retention
lacing
was
in
nice
sheets
lots
of
it
aroma
was
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
burnt
or
roasted
notes
smooth
taste
profile
malty
subtle
hopping
and
a
slight
roasted
tone
medium
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
very
drinkable
dark
beer
not
bad
and
i
think
ill
have
it
again
good
first
effort
but
it
needs
some
tweaking
before
celebrator
needs
to
worry

some

a

tastes
chocolatey
with
a
rough

edge
i
do
get
some
citrusy
hop
character
but
cant
identify
the
type
specifically
hop
bitter
is
quite
strong
and
the
aftertaste
is
rough
grassy
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
bock
i
anticipated
a
caramally
sweet
beer
caramel
is
only
found
with
searching
and
actually
comes
across
as
toffee
as
the
beer
has
warmed
i
get
some
roast
flavor
during
the
draw
and
before
the
swallow
that
i
think
contributes
to
what
i
was
perceiving
as
hop
bitter
to
style
id
place
this
as
a
sweet
stout
medium
mouthfeel
and
slightly
creamy
and
moderately
carbonated
poured
a
bit
too
aggressively
into
a
standard
beer
mug
the

over

the
still
lingering
puddles
of
bright
sweetness
mouthfeel
perfectly
round
a
little
chewy
middling
carbonation
pretty
damn
good
it
pours
an
incredibly
dark
ruby
brown
so
dark
it
appears
black
when
not
held

the
light
a
3
finger
lighttan
head
sits
atop
falling
to
a
finger
over
top
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
i
get
a
blast
of
piney
and
spicey
hop
over
a
chunky
malt
backbone
of
roasted
nutty
notes
the
flavor
is
a
let
down
i
get
an
initial
bitter
when
i
first
sip
it
moves
to
a
light
roasted
to
slightly
burnt
character
but
overall
the
flavor
is
light
the
feel
is
light
as
well
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
body
here
its
not
a
hard
to
drink
brew
but
the
lack
of
flavor
just
misses
for
me
just
okay
on
this
one
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
first
hits
me
with
some
pine
hops
then
is
followed
by
some
dark
malts
lots
of
hops
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
a
moderate
dark
malt
flavor
along
with
a
strong
pine
hop
character
the
body
is
very
thin
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
is
good
the
smell
is
nice
bringing
dark
malts
and
a
rich
chocolate
smell
the
taste
is
good
and
solid
with
plenty
of
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thin
while
the
drinkability
is
good
fruity
aromatic
notes
of
raisins
and
figs
waft
from
my
glass
as
i
pour
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
color
that
shows
ruby
notes
when
held
up
to
the
light
as
well
as
the
fruitiness
i
get
notes
of
chocolate
a
hint
of
lightly
spicy
hops
toasted
malt
this
is
really
quite
interesting
in
the
nose
it
is
richly
malty
the
taste
is
ever
so
lightly
sweet
it
is
richly
malty
compared
to
the
sweetness
which
is
quite
nice
the
beer
has
notes
of
chocolate
toasted
malt
and
dark
caramel
this
beer
finishes
quite
dry
with
a
lightly
astringent
note
of
toasted
malt
that
tends
to
linger
a
bit
this
note
makes
you
thirsty
and
ready
for
another
sip
this
beer
has
a
fairly
light
body
to
it
at
least
for
a
bock
it
does
have
a
decent
amount
of
mouthcoating
maltiness
to
it
though
there
is
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
this
beer
that
i
would
attribute
to
hops
other
than
this
the
beer
is
pretty
low
on
the
hopping
scale
there
is
just
enough
to
make
sure
the
malt
is
not
cloying
this
is
really
quite
nice
and
is
almost
a
quaffing
bock
by
which
i
mean
a
22oz
bottle
is
just
about
the
right
amount

would

this

review
here
bottom
line
is
you
will
love
it
winter
time
beer
of
choice
for
me
stick
to
your
ribs
taste
similar
to
a
marzen
so
you
can
drink
like
its
oktoberfest
all
year
long
this
one
was
a
sacrificial
lamb
left
in
my
beer
fridge
after
mopping
the
floor
with
one
of
my
friends
at
the
poker
table
seeing
as
how
michelob
was
a
gateway
beer
for
me
ala
killians
heineken
etc
i
had
to
give
it
a
go
again
for
nothing
other
than
nostalgia
the
bottle
pours
in
to
a
fluted
glass
with
a
sudsy
vanilla
head
atop
a
translucent
walnut
brown
lager
the
head
settles
quickly
in
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
with
an
appealing
collar
it
has
an
appetizing
appearance
ill
give
it
that
the
nose
is
fairly
subdued
with
a
malty
smell
and
fruity
undertones
a
bit
of
copperlike
aroma
as
well
its
a
slightly
more
sophisticated
fragrance
than
bud
typical
ab
flavor
profile
with
a
beefed
up
malt
presence
and
a
bit
of
toffee
sweetness
slight
fruitiness
through
the
middle
with
no
discernible
hop
character
and
only
a
hint
of
any
balancing
bitterness
some
lingering
corn
flavor
and
only
the
faintest
suggestion
of
toasted
malts
in
the
finish
this
is
billed
as
100
malt
but
the
aromaflavor
certainly
lead
one
to
believe
that
there
are
some
adjuncts
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumthin
with
a
light
slick
body
gulpable
crisp
and
refreshing
an
easy
quaff
thats
pretty
clean
is
it
a
bock
no
its
a
pig
with
lipstick
however
just
because
i
can
pull
out
the
common
threads
from
lesser
beers
like
bud
doesnt
mean
that
its
a
bad
beer
i
rather
enjoyed
it
its
a
dark
american
lager
basic
but
better
than
most
beer
enthusiasts
would
have
you
believe
now
bring
back
that
signature
michelob
bottle
i
didnt
expect
much
out
of
this
and
it
met
those
expectations
cheap
taste
cheap
price
beer
good
malty
beer
with
a
little
roast
chocolate
caramel
overall
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
should
pair
well
with
many
foods
expensive
at
the
bowling
nothing
special
the
best
thing
that
comes
out
of
the
michelob
family
overall
not
quite
as
bad
a
beer
as
i
had
been
led
to
believe
but
really
it
was
just
a
bit
boring
perhaps
it
was
intended
as
a
halfway
between
standard
lowtaste
lagers
and
a
german
style
bock
whatever
the
case
it
is
not
a
great
compromise

also
some

with
this

overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
5
out

i
would
buy
this
brew
again
decent
mass
produced
beer
for
those
that
want
to
taste
what
they
are
drinking
without
breaking
the
bank
it
serves
that
purpose
well
dark
amber
color
with
decent
head
and
retention
malt
forward
with
the
taste
and
smell
and
a
slightly
rich
feel
with
little
carbonation
an
okay
beer
resemblance
to
that
looks
good
in
the
glass
like
an
amber
but
almost
no
taste
bitterness
or
hop
character
not
sure
what
makes
it
a
bock
for
the
same
price
you
can
get
far
superior
full
sail
esb
or
amber
or
many
other
decent
offerings
pass
took
a
chance
on
it
since
the
store
i
stopped
at
didnt
have
shiner
bock
good
tasting
beer
smells
of
floral
and
caramel
notes
not
as
good
as
shiner
but
a
lot
smoother
and
easier
to
drink
than
some
bocks
can
taste
the
caramel
and
corn
tastes
no
skunk
to
it
goes
down
easy
around
a
fire
found
myself
drinking
the
whole
case
overall
the
last
few
beers
i
have
rated
i
havent
been
very
impressed
with
they
were
less
than
satisfactory
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
a
welcome
addition
to
my
beer
cache
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
amber
bock
and
i
will
buy
it
again
o
nothing
special
but
its
not
bad
id
get
it
if
i
was
in
a
pinch
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
pours
a
deep
brown
in
color
with
some
ruby
highlights
a
very
thin
beige
head
was
seen
with
actually
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
very
light
and
of
roasted
malts
with
some
chocolate
the
taste
is
more
stronger
than
the
aroma
which
is
a
good
thing
was
it
is
very
smooth
to
drink
perfect
carbonation
and
goes
down
easy
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
is
noted
overall
not
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
here
probably
ok
from
the
bottle
when
not
under
scrutiny
oa
nice
dark
lager
wouldnt
buy
again
but
only
because
i
would
rather
try
other
beers
but
still
enjoyable
it
pours
reddishbrown
overwhelming
that
dissipates
rapidly
some
lacings
and
decent
carbonation
it
has
sweet
malty
taste
little
aroma
with
hints
of
roasted
grains
there
is
no
bite
or
edge
goes
done
easy
and
is
not
filling
above
average
come
pared
to
the
lesser
anheuser
products
cheap
grains
quite
sweet
fair
amount
of
flavor
but
no
depth
hops
seem
to
barely
be
there
if
at
all
theres
not
much
to
say
about
michelob
amberbock
other
than
the
fact
that
its
a
nice
option
for
the
price
it
is
its
about
the
same
price
as
a
bud
light
but
actually
has
a
bit
of
flavor
i
made
this
profile
just
to
review
how
awful
this
beer
is
basically
take
a
watereddown
light
beer
and
throw
in
some
food
coloring
and
this
is
what
youd
get
head
immediately
goes
away
unlike
the
thick
head
in
the
photo
on
the
case
and
description
on
the
bottle
is
so
far
off
reality
i
think
they
probably
plagiarized
it
from
some
actual
beer
truly
a
beer
for
men
who
want
to
look
like
men
but
wish
they
were
drinking
a
zima
instead
osolid
beer
with
nice
taste
that
gives
you
more
overall
i
enjoy
it
not
as
anything
special
but
when
i
want
a
cheap
non
flavorful
beer
i
would
pick
this
anyday
over
pretty
much
anything
else
ab
mass
produces
i
bought
this
beer
to
use
as
a
reference
color
for
my
homebrews
and
while
it
is
certainly
drinkable
there
is
just
no
compelling
reason
to
consume
it
regularly
especially
considering
that
it
is
hardly
a
bargain
i
am
a
novice
drinker
even
though
i
am
in
my
60s
and
never
really
cared
for
beer
this
one
drinks
nicely
and
was
enjoyable
to
drink
my
little
brother
has
much
more
experience
with
beer
and
drinking
in
general
and
i
am
going
to
ask
him
to
taste
this
one
is
that
enough
letters
now
as
an
early
boomer
i
was
a
sucker
for

it
is

is

the
only
dark
around
the
appearance

are

the

has

sort
of
a

if

this
would
win

maybe
a

amount
of

the

tasted
sweet
and
there
was
not

flavor
that
you
would
expect
from
a

beer
there
is
a
very
slight
hint
of
hop
bitterness
i
would
classify
this
as
having

this
beer
is
a
nothing
more
then
a

beer
if
used
for

probably
still
choose
it

the
first
time
i
had
it
it
was
to
my
surprise
better
than
i
had
anticipated
definitely
not
a
bock
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
though
it
is
one
of
the
better
macro
beers
ive
had
easy
conversion
beer
for
the
bud
fans
more
than
likely
its
just
a
way
us
beer
geeks
can
survive
at
a
bar
with
a
crummy
selection
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
much
cheaper
than
most
of
the
style
but
lives
up
to
abs
strict
quality
in
finish
you
get
what
you
pay
for
pours
a
perfectly
clear
dark
amber
with
coffeebrown
highlights
and
a
slightly
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
attractive
on
the
nose
not
much
to
tell
theres
a
slight
yeasty
fruitiness
but
its
kind
of
below
perception
threshold
so
its
difficult
to
pin
down
what
the
fruits
are
a
touch
of
graininess
as
well
but
its
a
pretty
mild
or
bland
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
mild
overall
it
starts
off
with
some
metallic
notes
and
then
some
nice
roasty
munich
malts
at
the
midpalate
the
finish
veers
back
toward
metals
these
flavors
are
of
medium
quality
nothing
offensive
nothing
revelatory
mouthfeel
is
light
for
the
style
with
good
balancing
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
it
shouldnt
win
any
awards
but
it
is
a
decent
beer
that
would
be
an
excellent
fallback
if
stranded
in
an
allab
world
d
pretty
drinkable
i
would
drink
definately
drink
it
again
a
major
plus
is
you
can
find
it
much
cheaper
than
most
bock
beers

have
no

with

i
can
deffinitely
see
drinking

i
wanted
to
give
this

it
just
plain
sucks
nothing
bocklike
about
this

is
a

they
seem
to
put
smg
in

as
well
id
rather
have
a

a
pretty
drinkable
beer
and
almost
definitely
the
best
ab
beer
on
the
market
but
there
is
almost
always
a
better
choice
than
this
one
cheers2beers
this
one
is
a
decent
drinker
crisply
carbonated
and
smooth
on
the
palette
but
with
much
better
flavor
than
the
typical
bmc
junk
yes
i
am
aware
that
this
is
an
ab
product
you
will
usually
find
on
draft
at
the
same
places
this
is
served
id
never
actively
seek
this
beer
but
when
the
only
alternatives
are
bud
coors
light
and
corona
i
will
gladly
take
it
da
just
thought
i
would
give
it
a
shot
and
it
only
cost
me
1
05
for
the
bottle
had
one
with
a
pizza
not
much
selection
at
this
establishment
probably
should
have
ordered
the
pbr
instead
presented
in
a
12
oz
bottle
born
on
date
21dec06
pours
into
a
frosty
mug
a
dark
red
color
with
lively
carbonation
fueling
a
1finger
brownish
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
spotty
cap
fairly
average
here
nose
of
sweet
malt
and
a
slight
iron
metallic
scent
tastes
of
corn
adjuncts
and
not
much
else
no
real
malt
character
all
all
a
tiny
bit
bitter
upon
the
finish
mouth
is
quite
bubbly
yet
smooth
watery
and
a
somewhat
thin
drinkabilty
is
pretty
hohum
this
is
basically
a
redcolored
macro
really
theres
nothing
to
it
avoid
this
might
be
good
for
the
cheap
beer
connoisseur
who
wants
to
fork
out
an
extra
dollar
for
something
darker
on
a
special
occasion
otherwise
understand
that
this
is
pretty
much
a
typical
ab
product
and
nothing
worth
buying
i
cant
even
see
this
as
being
a
good
transition
beer
for
someone
wanting
to
get
into
craft
beer
this
is
a
beer
for
people
who
are
already
in
the
budweiser
fan
club
if
youre
not
get
something
else
this
is
not
worth
your
time
or
money
drank
easy
enough
just
not
a
bock
still
would
take
this
over
a
shiner
or
bmc
any
day
large
chalice
ordered
at
lone
star
murky
brownamber
decent
lacing
not
great
but
way
better
than
i
was
expecting
lagers
are
my
least
favorite
i
know
the
lable
says
bock
but
cmon
but
this
was
tolerable
faint
aroma
roasted
malts
no
real
hop
addition
while
im
not
overly
impressed
with
this
ab
offering
i
think
it
is
a
step
away
from
fizzy
yellow
flavorless
light
beers
and
that
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
ive
had
worse
much
worse
drinkable
as
far
as
a
macro
goes
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
however
it
is
usually
the
most
flavorful
offering
at
the
bars
in
my
area
note
why
is
this
beer
classified
under
the
bock
style
just
because
it
says
bock
doesnt
make
it
so
not
much
here
but
just
enough
to
dislike
overall
this
is
a
modest
example
of
the
bock
style
it
lacks
some
complexity
and
its
a
bit
thinner
than
most
bocks
ive
had
however
for
being
widely
available
and
from
a
macro
its
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
off
tap
this
yields
a
decent
dark
amber
but
loses
its
head
very
quickly
it
tends
to
give
off
a
bit
of
a
sour
scent
with
little
there
at
all
the
taste
is
rather
bland
and
lacking
in
anything
it
goes
does
watery
and
lifeless
its
drinkable
more
so
after
a
few
better
choices
if
you
are
seeking
something
more
than
swill
but
less
that
quality
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
nowhere
near
good
and
definitely
not
very
bockish
12
ounce
bottle
got
this
one
on
tap
beer
was
amber
brown
with
a
white
foamy
head
the
smell
was
sweet
of
amber
and
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
initially
of
the
nose
with
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
the
beer
has
a
light
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
light
and
not
offensive
not
impressive
either
though
overall
a
decent
and
drinkable
brew
sessionble
and
perhaps
a
good
gateway
beer
a
decent
brew
i
got
this
pint
on
draft
at
prime
time
sports
grill
it
was
a
dark
brown
color
with
about
2
fingers
of
head
the
retention
was
fast
and
there
was
little
lace
but
the
lace
that
was
there
was
sticky
the
smell
was
malty
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
both
well
blended
good
brew
dont
drink
and
review
the
taste
is
surprisingly
good
very
uncomplicated
and
again
nothing
offensive
this
is
actually
a
rather
refreshing
brew
and
one
i
dont
mind
having
with
dinner
this
is
a
very
drinkable
session
beverage
and
id
take
it
over
many
imported
amberdark
lagers
not
all
that
great
but
if
the
alternative
is
michelob
ultra
lite
what
can
you
do
would
i
buy
this
again
probably
not
the
taste
isnt
too
bad
but
i
prefer
some
hop
bite
in
my
beer
along
with
some
carbonation
michelob
amber
bock
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
very
little
aroma
maybe
a
slight
amount
of
malt
mostly
tasteless
as
well
some
malt
and
thats
it
tastes
watery
not
very
bock
like
no
off
flavors
but
not
much
flavor
period
taste
is
very
sweet
and
thin
bodied
my
beer
may
be
a
bit
warm
so
it
doesnt
really
taste
very
good
as
i
recall
this
beer
cold
isnt
much
better
as
far
as
a
popular
bock
shiner
is
probably
a
little
better
but
not
by
much
has
more
flavor
and
body
than
the
other
ab
offerings
drinkable
due
to
fairly
low
abv
12
oz
bornon
82106
and
pours
a
dark
amber
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
leaves
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
nondescript
with
mild
grains
or
toasted
malts
and
adjuncts
very
very
light
the
only
flavors
i
can
detect
are
light
toastedcaramel
malts
on
top
of
a
light
tingly
body
that
leaves
short
finish
overall
unmemorable
essentially
tastes
like
michelob
but
with
traces
of
darker
malts
and
i
dont
think
one
can
make
a
real
bock
with
adjuncts
this
beer
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
head
that
did
no
last
long
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
the
taste
was
mild
and
malty
the
mouthfeel
is
not
thin
but
not
quite
full
bodied
the
carbonation
is
noticeable
this
would
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
smooth
and
easy
to
kick
back
just
not
particularly
interesting
the
taste
was
watered
down
and
lacked
any
character
just
another
mass
produced
beer
that
they
are
trying
to
market
to
the
beer
enthusiasts
i
will
try
this
over
most
other
mass
produced
beers
but
will
pass
it
by
if
there
are
any
other
true
micros
around
leave
this
one
in
the
box
reddish
copper
body
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
is
faintly
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
on
par
with
the
smell
there
just
isnt
alot
there
starts
with
a
light
sweetness
and
finished
up
with
a
slight
bitterness
feel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
i
believe
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
why
would
i
want
to
unless
nothing
else
is
available
overall
not
a
bad
beer
its
better
than
most
macros
but
its
nothing
special
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
the
amber
bock
probably
the
best
macro
beer
you
can
find
on
tap
south
of
the
masondixon
line
pours
with
a
light
head
and
a
dark
transparent
copper
color
almost
like
a
oktoberfest
missing
most
of
the
depth
of
flavor
but
they
did
bring
along
some
of
the
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
had
on
tap
at
the
golf
club
on
a
hot
day
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
bmc
macro
nice
dark
color
with
lingering
offwhite
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
was
mild
but
had
some
malty
roasted
nut
undertones
this
had
an
okay
taste
and
smooth
finish
all
and
all
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
price
michelob
amber
bock
was
a
dark
amber
color
and
very
clear
the
offwhite
head
was
quick
to
dissapear
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
mainly
malt
the
taste
was
lightly
malty
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
medium
carbonation
its
an
easy
drinking
fairly
tasteless
beer
drinkable
as
city
tap
water
from
an
old
pipe
if
one
is
branching
out
to
explore
new
beers
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
it
s
misleading
because
it
isnt
a
real
amber
bock
but
enjoyable
non
the
less
not
much
of
a
bock
more
a
light
lager
with
dark
features
i
was
relegated
to
drinking
this
at
a
football
tailgate
where
the
beer
was
provided
by
others
it
was
this
or
bud
light
which
unfortunately
i
actually
tried
again
this
looks
like
a
decent
beer
with
very
little
nose
other
than
some
slight
maltiness
the
taste
was
o
k
and
ambrosia
compared
to
stump
water
bud
light
it
had
as
expected
no
mouthfeel
as
pracically
no
macros
do
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
if
you
dont
mind
the
aftertaste
which
is
a
little
bitter
and
not
in
a
good
hoppy
way
so
this
beer
isnt
great
but
its
better
than
drinking
miller
lite
bud
light
or
coors
light
all
night
d
easily
approachable
i
find
it
a
little
syrupy
poured
into
a
pilsner
had
a
dark
reddish
colour
with
visible
carbination
and
a
practically
non
existant
head
it
was
a
quick
pour
and
all
i
got
was
a
slight
ring
lacing
was
also
minimal
the
smell
wasnt
stong
at
all
but
i
was
picking
up
sweet
malts
the
taste
was
sweet
and
enjoyable
with
caramel
being
the
most
obvious
flavour
for
me
i
didnt
really
taste
any
hops
at
all
though
and
i
think
i
would
have
enjoyed
just
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
i
find
the
overall
taste
a
little
one
dimensional
the
mouthfeel
in
my
opinion
is
the
weakest
characteristic
like
many
said
its
light
bodied
and
quite
watery
and
in
my
opinion
detracts
from
the
taste
a
little
to
its
credit
though
as
the
beer
warmed
the
mouthfeel
got
creamier
and
a
little
more
enjoyable
overall
though
even
though
the
beer
is
a
little
plain
and
light
i
did
enjoy
it
and
would
drink
a
few
if
there
was
none
of
my
favourites
around
the
first
mistake
michelob
made
was
to
call
this
a
bock
it
really
doesnt
seem
to
fit
into
that
style
however
i
think
a
lot
of
folks
will
immediately
dislike
this
beer
just
because
it
has
the
name
michelob
on
it
despite
all
that
its
really
not
a
bad
beer
for
what
it
is
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
quickly
aroma
of
soft
malt
caramel
fairly
lively
carbonation
with
a
thin
body
but
for
this
particular
beer
the
carbonation
fits
nicely
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
cloyingly
so
very
little
hops
presence
to
offset
the
sweet
maltiness
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
without
being
too
heavy
this
beer
is
farmost
one
of
my
most
favored
domestic
beers
in
the
united
states
since
i
am
not
a
fan
of
light
beers
this
is
a
nice
dark
beer
it
is
not
to
dark
where
it
is
hard
to
drink
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
great
taste
if
i
were
to
walk
into
a
beer
distributor
9
times
out
of
10
i
would
walk
out
with
this
beer
i
recommend
this
beer
to
everyone
it
is
truely
a
great
beer
overall
not
a
bad
ab
product
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
bad
in
the
taste
department
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
and
would
even
buy
a
case
if
i
had
to
go
to
a
picnic
or
something
overall
the
scent
is
good
but
i
will
never
have
this
one
again
this
one
needs
some
tweaking
the
theme
here
is
it
is
overly
sweet
and
too
thin
if
these
two
things
were
fixed
this
would
be
a
passable
stab
at
the
style
as
it
stands
now
its
not
quite
sweet
but
the
body
ruins
this
beer
it
is
way
too
thin
to
fit
the
bock
profile
this
reminds
me
of
michelobs
entry
into
the
dark
beer
world
no
real
flaws
but
no
umph
either
i
was
in
a
dimly
lit
room
so
i
couldnt
really
tell
the
color
dark
brown
was
all
i
could
see
couldnt
pick
up
on
the
subleties
it
had
a
quickly
desolving
head
but
left
a
decent
lace
at
first
drink
it
had
a
very
sweet
taste
which
lasted
all
the
way
through
smooth
beer
overall
i
ate
it
with
a
new
york
strip
which
complemented
it
nicely
id
get
this
again
there
are
too
many
other
beers
of
about
the
same
price
that
are
much
better
its
not
horrible
but
not
anything
near
notable
either
overall
this
beer
should
not
have
the
word
bock
anywhere
near
it
it
is
a
weak
watery
boring
brew
i
guess
its
better
than
budweiser
though
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
unimpressive
this
is
a
dark
lager
more
than
anything
similiar
to
heineken
dark
a
decent
offering
from
anheuserbusch
had
this
at
a
craptastic
bar
out
of
town
best
beer
in
the
joint
into
a
pint
glass
actually
a
fantastic
pour
a
thick
and
creamy
head
that
lasted
a
good
5
minutes
slightly
dark
amber
in
color
and
pretty
good
lacing
served
a
little
too
cold
waited
for
it
to
warm
to
smell
faint
mildly
roasted
malt
crisp
yet
smooth
and
creamy
mouth
lead
to
a
pretty
weak
but
pleasant
malt
and
hop
bitter
with
a
nonexistant
aftertaste
like
all
other
ab
products
it
seems
meant
to
be
drank
then
forgotten
that
said
this
was
one
of
my
college
goto
beers
cheap
enough
yet
had
enough
taste
the
color
was
an
amberred
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
the
smell
had
a
light
malt
aroma
and
was
fairly
mild
the
taste
was
pretty
good
with
a
mediumlight
and
crisp
body
and
mild
hops
that
wasnt
too
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
was
average
and
crisp
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
i
felt
that
this
was
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
body
to
keep
me
satisfied
as
well
as
a
crisp
refreshing
taste
good
allaround
beer
very
clear
medium
dark
brown
with
a
halffinger
head
that
is
a
creamy
light
tan
a
lightly
toasty
malt
that
lends
a
touch
of
earthiness
to
the
nose
i
taste
the
toasty
malt
and
a
quite
spicy
hop
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
more
substantial
than
your
average
macro
cheap
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
brew
and
a
little
unfairly
discriminated
against
because
of
its
close
relation
to
macropoop
looks
like
soda
except
the
head
stayed
up
for
a
few
seconds
longer
still
it
was
a
brownish
amber
with
big
bubbles
no
lacing
and
little
retention
smelled
like
wort
what
the
hell
is
this
a
nonalcoholic
also
a
vague
toasted
graininess
in
the
nose
the
flavor
was
strange
as
well
plasticized
caramel
flavoring
trying
to
meld
with
a
decent
barley
component
sweet
again
my
mind
cannot
shake
the
whole
soda
idea
is
this
malta
goya
or
what
thin
and
well
yech
at
a
shit
bar
and
what
is
there
to
drink
hmm
a
pitcher
of
mick
amber
bock
should
do
me
well
to
play
pool
and
celebrate
a
little
this
beer
isnt
half
bad
amber
well
not
quite
the
color
is
a
few
srm
too
dark
but
whos
counting
in
held
a
head
for
a
while
and
laced
the
pitcher
i
was
drinking
from
smelled
of
bland
lager
clean
beer
with
a
hint
of
roast
and
a
distinct
sweetness
the
taste
was
underwhelming
not
really
malty
more
like
the
memory
of
a
good
beer
and
the
hops
were
pretty
much
nonexsistant
the
mouthfeel
was
some
what
there
but
mostly
not
and
the
aftertaste
is
not
really
a
desired
thing
i
had
a
pitcher
and
it
was
better
than
most
light
nasty
on
tap
but
i
think
it
is
still
close
to
avoid
even
though
my
rating
might
be
higher
dark
clear
ruby
red
beat
sugar
flavor
and
no
head
even
though
carbonation
was
ok
i
could
not
finish
this
beet
sugar
water
could
be
because
i
had
left
pizza
port
and
all
their
good
brews
and
went
to
a
crappy
bar
that
had
only
this
if
i
could
give
a
negative
score
on
flavor
i
would
i
feel
bad
about
such
a
bad
review
but
this
beer
is
terrible
i
may
try
it
again
in
the
bottle
and
then
re
rate
ph
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
lace
for
a
head
the
aroma
is
weak
just
a
hint
of
toasted
grains
taste
is
average
at
best
toasted
grains
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
a
little
bit
of
hop
can
be
tasted
has
an
odd
sweet
finish
light
body
makes
it
drinkable
this
beer
is
ok
but
it
is
no
bock
i
have
this
ontap
at
a
local
italian
place
pretty
regularly
hold
up
fairly
decently
even
though
its
a
macro
pretty
much
average
all
the
way
down
the
line
decent
enough
but
nothing
to
seek
out
d
not
a
bad
beer
when
the
choice
is
bud
bud
lite
and
similar
beers
its
a
bit
sweet
but
i
can
handle
that
it
needs
a
deeper
and
richer
taste
to
be
a
really
good
beer
nice
dark
amber
body
but
with
a
minimal
head
that
barely
holds
together
decently
malty
aroma
but
not
a
great
deal
of
depth
with
a
very
slight
backnote
of
hops
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
a
pretty
weak
flavor
for
a
bock
but
pleasant
nevertheless
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
for
the
style
nicely
drinkable
this
is
clearly
a
bock
beer
for
macro
lovers
easy
to
drink
and
not
much
else
except
a
bit
of
malt
for
microcraft
drinkers
try
if
your
curious
if
not
this
might
not
be
your
thing
when
poured
it
showed
a
color
so
dark
brown
that
it
could
be
discribed
as
black
with
nice
tan
foam
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
mild
hops
filled
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
a
mild
nature
the
roasted
malts
and
hops
were
very
pleasant
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
not
a
bitter
or
sour
taste
or
after
taste
the
alcohol
really
dries
out
the
finish
on
this
one
especially
when
combined
with
the
hollow
taste
profile
the
result
is
a
beer
that
can
be
poured
down
your
throat
or
drain
quite
easily
but
perhaps
not
all
that
pleasantly
at
least
for
the
throat
option
a
good
beer
to
have
around
that
is
pretty
good
for
a
macro
american
product
that
your
buddies
will
drink
too
i
rated
it
average
because
it
is
better
than
most
stuff
you
can
get
from
ab
but
is
not
as
good
as
some
other
bock
beers
out
there
this
beer
i
had
once
before
and
i
was
like
not
too
bad
nothing
im
after
though
i
tried
it
now
a
year
later
and
i
must
say
after
a
few
sips
it
tasted
like
crap
to
me
it
smells
kinda
sour
and
bitter
not
too
good
really
the
taste
is
awful
its
sorta
malty
then
just
dark
brown
sludgy
tasting
i
did
not
like
this
i
was
shocked
because
i
thought
it
was
supposed
to
be
so
darn
good
the
mouthfeel
was
sludgy
i
thought
the
drinkability
was
low
because
it
was
just
not
an
appealing
beer
at
all
tastewise
and
then
the
carbonation
was
so
much
i
was
burping
up
for
about
10
minutes
cheers
taste
none
this
beer
had
so
little
taste
to
it
i
might
as
well
of
saved
some
money
and
had
an
ultra
not
impressed
poured
dark
brown
smells
of
slight
dark
malt
taste
is
pretty
good
malty
and
fairly
rich
yet
fairly
simple
finish
is
kinda
sweet
overall
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
from
anheuserbusch
ive
been
to
the
theme
park
in
florida
busch
gardens
you
can
get
a
couple
free
amber
bocks
if
you
want
they
taste
alot
better
at
the
park
on
tap
fresh
and
malty
overall
it
can
be
drinkable
due
to
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
anything
that
gives
it
character
certainly
not
a
good
beer
in
the
style
again
this
is
exactly
like
flat
coca
cola
shakeys
pizza
has
some
sort
of
deal
with
ab
that
allows
them
to
call
this
beer
shakeys
ale
or
something
like
that
its
actually
michelob
amber
pours
a
copper
color
some
carbonation
small
head
some
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
scent
is
kinda
sweet
fruity
and
slightly
malty
the
taste
is
malty
but
a
little
bit
watery
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
bitter
lightmedium
body
drinkable
but
i
would
not
buy
again
mildly
astringent
with
a
malty
aftertaste
that
dies
fast
lightly
carbonated
with
a
medium
light
body
while
it
is
much
better
than
most
ab
product
save
celebrate
this
beer
is
not
even
up
to
midpack
standards
sadly
it
is
more
show
than
go
a
bock
it
aint
drink
it
you
like
your
pale
yellow
fizzy
lagers
and
want
to
try
something
you
think
is
very
different
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
especially
at
1
a
glass
but
its
nothing
special
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
and
some
lacing
smell
is
of
a
typical
macro
lager
but
with
some
roasted
grain
and
maybe
a
hint
of
some
coffee
there
is
maybe
a
little
bit
of
coffee
in
the
taste
hard
to
sense
any
hops
even
though
the
label
suggests
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
saying
that
this
taste
existed
in
this
beer
is
just
being
nice
it
just
tasted
so
off
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
mouthfeel
was
overcarbonated
and
on
the
thin
side
drinkability
was
awful
to
me
i
thought
at
the
very
least
this
would
be
drinkable
but
i
just
do
not
care
for
this
it
is
almost
a
task
to
finish
nice
rich
dark
amber
color
duh
with
a
light
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
aroma
is
rather
dull
there
is
a
bare
hint
of
toasted
barley
and
also
a
kind
of
metallic
aroma
like
a
galvanized
steel
bucket
the
flavor
is
a
little
bolder
than
bland
but
not
overwhelming
its
a
step
up
from
the
regular
michelob
but
far
from
a
craft
brew
the
hops
are
barely
noticable
and
the
overall
impression
strikes
me
as
dry
very
light
refreshing
but
with
a
tad
more
malt
character
than
the
usual
macro
swill
this
is
far
from
a
real
bock
but
this
compares
rather
favorably
and
maybe
even
a
touch
better
than
the
yuengling
traditional
lager
that
i
had
last
night
which
is
regarded
as
an
example
of
an
american
amberred
lager
i
think
if
this
were
in
that
style
category
it
would
fare
better
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
it
had
a
nice
dark
amber
color
to
it
and
it
held
onto
a
decent
head
throughout
drinking
it
the
smell
has
is
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
toasty
note
it
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
that
follows
up
the
aroma
nicely
with
more
toastiness
and
a
slight
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
only
slightly
too
watery
for
my
tastes
overall
great
for
a
macro
worth
trying
the
rice
twinge
comes
through
but
you
can
taste
the
bittering
hops
its
a
sweet
malt
based
beer
though
nice
level
of
toastiness
with
some
mild
fruitness
as
well
overall
its
not
that
much
different
from
a
normal
macro
lager
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
for
a
bock
decent
try
but
not
quite
there
tarnished
copper
color
crystal
clear
with
an
offwhite
head
that
rises
up
and
settles
out
quickly
like
a
soda
pour
aroma
of
malt
and
brown
sugar
and
a
bit
of
molasses
watery
and
slick
mouthfeel
leads
to
a
flavor
of
bready
malt
and
understated
caramel
finishes
with
a
carbonation
tingle
leading
to
a
tannic
metallic
lingering
taste
unremarkable
unmemorable
not
at
all
a
bock
for
my
tastes
not
bad
just
nothing
there
d
not
a
bad
stepping
stone
beer
quite
plain
but
quite
drinkable
at
the
same
time
this
beer
is
to
ab
as
killians
red
is
to
coors
misleading
with
the
whole
bock
thing
id
love
to
see
an
allmalt
6
5
abv
version
from
ab
i
needed
a
change
of
pace
fom
the
miller
products
id
been
guzzling
all
nite
at
the
eagles
club
so
i
decided
what
the
hell
this
was
not
what
i
was
thinking
it
should
have
been
but
it
was
cold
and
wet
it
looked
good
in
the
glass
that
was
bout
itit
smelled
stale
evidentily
its
not
a
fast
mover
at
the
old
timers
bar
it
taste
like
water
almost
a
little
bit
of
week
beer
all
i
know
is
i
could
not
drink
this
all
nite
i
will
stick
to
the
miller
products
poured
out
a
dark
amber
brew
with
a
one
finger
head
that
disappears
after
a
minute
very
little
carbonation
smels
of
nothing
much
slight
malt
smell
taste
is
palenot
terrible
at
all
but
just
low
in
flavor
sweet
malt
seems
to
shine
thru
mostly
very
little
hop
balance
its
apparent
that
this
brew
was
made
for
the
slightly
adventurus
macro
drinker
and
paled
down
as
to
not
offend
really
not
a
terrible
brew
at
alltruthfully
id
have
a
few
if
its
the
only
option
id
have
instead
of
regular
macros
mouthfeel
nothing
majorwhat
did
u
expect
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
i
think
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
a
dreadfully
medicore
beer
better
than
bud
light
but
that
aint
saying
much
now
wheres
my
sam
smith
this
is
the
single
worst
of
the
michelob
craft
beer
sampler
pack
ive
seen
it
in
six
packs
i
dont
know
why
they
choose
to
make
such
a
substandard
beer
available
in
sixers
when
several
of
the
others
are
much
better
the
marzen
and
the
pale
ale
for
example
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
with
a
decent
head
that
refuses
to
hold
the
beer
smells
slightly
skunked
but
does
smell
nicely
of
some
mild
hops
it
tastes
fairly
decent
amount
of
hops
but
the
claim
of
roasted
hops
are
almost
indescernable
the
carbonation
feels
artificial
but
it
is
fairly
smooth
and
not
too
watery
the
hop
level
is
its
only
saving
grace
it
tastes
more
like
an
american
macro
lager
than
a
bock
it
almosts
seems
as
if
the
darkness
is
there
to
trick
you
drinkability
i
wouldnt
necessarily
refuse
this
and
its
better
than
a
light
beer
but
for
the
style
it
doesnt
even
remotely
do
it
justice
and
is
a
very
subpar
example
however
im
not
having
trouble
drinking
this
as
nothing
is
extremely
unpleasant
just
pretty
much
all
mediocre
average
at
first
glance
it
looks
jet
black
but
when
you
get
a
better
look
at
it
its
actually
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thin
head
of
white
foam
the
only
thing
i
could
smell
was
some
malts
the
taste
was
that
of
some
sweet
malts
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
light
and
watery
to
me
and
for
a
bock
its
good
but
not
that
good
what
can
you
expect
from
a
product
made
by
ab
this
is
a
beer
that
would
make
an
excellent
choice
if
the
only
thing
around
is
macros
pours
dark
amber
clear
and
highly
carbonated
the
two
finger
head
of
an
offwhite
color
has
thin
consistency
and
soon
vanishes
completely
some
dark
toasted
notes
in
the
nose
with
faint
hops
a
mild
but
pleasent
roasted
flavor
is
sweet
and
smooth
and
the
hop
flavor
only
appears
in
the
aftertaste
the
light
body
and
clean
finish
create
a
high
drinkability
but
a
lack
of
character
makes
this
a
weak
interpretation
of
the
style
just
not
that
drinkable
a
fakely
sweetned
guinness
or
something
cant
wait
to
see
what
abs
upcoming
craft
beers
will
be
like
a
little
sweet
caramelly
and
light
on
hops
but
a
decent
blend
and
probably
a
good
introduction
to
other
styles
for
the
mass
market
lager
drinker
ive
already
reviewed
this
beer
from
the
bottle
the
experience
was
almost
identical
from
the
tap
with
the
main
difference
being
that
from
the
tap
the
sweetness
of
the
maltsyrup
is
stronger
goes
down
a
bit
smother
with
a
cleaner
finish
overall
feelings
are
the
same
michelobs
amber
bock
pours
to
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
prodigious
head
formation
and
a
sweet
malty
nose
the
palate
is
very
light
but
has
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
finish
is
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
no
hops
are
discernible
the
chewy
caramelly
notes
i
want
in
a
bock
just
are
not
here
it
was
never
intended
to
be
a
german
style
bock
anyway
rather
it
is
patterned
on
texasstyle
bocks
like
shiner
in
that
the
beer
succeeds
pours
a
clear
reddish

no
head
some
grainy
and
caramel
aroma
light
bodied
crisp
clean
some
graininess
and
very
sweet
not
very
bock
like
but
would
make
a
decent
american
macro
lager
not
much
hop
character
or
bitterness
finishes
dry
no
after
taste
better
than
the
average
american
macro
a
typical
bastardization
of
a
good
beer
by
an
american
macrobrewery
this
bock
looks
overly
carbonated
offwhite
foam
that
hangs
around
a
short
while
and
laces
only
if
your
glass
is
really
dirty
aromas
are
almost
nil
slight
and
i
do
mean
slight
evidence
of
toasted
malt
bread
and
toffee
no
real
malt
aromas
tastes
disapointing
even
compared
to
the
aroma
no
real
malt
backbone
hop
flavor
or
bittering
or
spiciness
or
complexity
faint
flavors
of
toastyness
roastyness
a
bit
or
earthyness
and
astingency
is
the
only
characters
that
add
to
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
sticky
without
being
sweet
and
over
carbonation
masks
any
present
flavors
aftertaste
is
sticky
and
void
not
a
good
bock
it
doesnt
have
enough
character
to
call
it
a
bad
beer
too
thin
for
a
bock
beef
up
the
malt
a
bit
and
add
a
small
amount
of
body
and
it
might
not
be
too
bad
tasted

this
beer
pours
with
the
right
color
for
a
bock
a
very
lovely
dark
amber
color
however
unlike
the
norm
for
bocks
the
head
is
very
small
and
disappears
about
as
fast
as
the
foam
on
a
cola
it
smells
kind
of
caramel
and
grainy
nothing
too
special
as
for
taste
its
quite
watery
at
least
if
youre
going
to
call
it
a
bock
it
is
however
better
than
pretty
much
any
other
macro
beer
but
thats
really
not
saying
a
whole
lot
as
for
the
mouthfeel
well
it
tastes
much
like
water
and
really
feels
a
lot
like
water
too
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
thats
in
comparison
to
other
macros
and
noting
the
fact
that
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
too
much
of
anything
also
this
is
not
a
bock
there
should
be
some
designation
for
an
american
bock
with
shiner
being
the
classic
example
im
not
sure
if
its
true
but
i
read
somewhere
that
shiner
bock
is
called
a
bock
because
of
an
old
liquor
law
in
texas
requiring
beers
of
certain
alcholic
strength
to
be
labeled
bock
enjoyable
and
readily
available
darker
than
usual

is

something
i
drink
when
the

it

a

with

nothing

the

of

is
nice
moderately
watery
mouthfeel
but
not

this
is
certainly
not

otherwise
the

is

tastes
a

for
that

the

are
really
masked
i
cant
seem
to
wonder
how
much
adjuncts
are
included
i
guess
the
general
public
never
had
a
good
bock
before
this
is
watery

the

quiply

there

of
clean

drinkable
for

wets

just
fine
but
the

is
thin
with

not

a

all
and
all
a

drinkable
beer
also
i
should
note
that
i
live
in

and
the
closest

to
buy

has
a
very

i
think
amberbock
will
become
my
new
daily
swill
joey
i
suppose
its
good
and
different
for
a
macro
lager
but
i
was
disappointed
this
is
no
bock
the
body
does
not
match
the
color
i
started
drinking
it
thinking
this
would
be
something
new
and
when
i
finished
forgot
i
started
i
will
not
be
revisiting
this
beer
any
time
soon
was
at
the
father
in
laws
and
this
is
his
beer
of
choice
so
this
is
what
i
had
poured
a
dark
cola
type
with
little
to
no
head
more
of
a
fizzle
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
as
you
drank
smell
was
of
malt
with
a
hop
ending
taste
is
of
flat
coke
not
what
you
want
to
have
in
a
beer
granted
im
not
a
dark
lager
taste
but
even
so
much
better
out
there
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dull
no
pizazz
drinkable
if
you
are
forced
but
not
quenching
or
filling
like
a
big
blockbuster
that
goes
nowhere
much
better
out
there
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brownamber
color
with
a
small
head
that
left
quickly
that
was
a
little
odd
considering
it
was
on
tap
the
smell
seems
to
be
caramel
and
grains
taste
brings
me
a
definite
budweiser
taste
with
a
slightly
darker
grain
rice
is
very
noticeable
this
for
sure
is
no
bock
body
is
quite
weak
and
cant
help
sustain
any
pertinent
flavors
finish
is
forgetful
not
the
worst
beer
made
but
not
quite
average
either
replace
the
rice
with
twice
the
amount
of
munich
malt
and
maybe
theyd
have
something
here
it
was
a
little
bland
with
no
hops
infused
flavors
a
little
sweet
malt
with
a
frothy
head
and
a
brown
color
not
alot
of
taste
tahts
for
sure
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
these
for
3
50
at
a
coast
guard
package
store
and
i
was
plesantly
surprised
at
the
price
not
the
beer
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
ab
if
i
could
only
choose
one
beer
from
ab
this
would
be
the
one
michelob
amber
bock
reminds
me
of
killians
irish
red
not
so
much
because
of
the
smell
taste
etc
though
they
do
look
similar
but
because
theyre
both
socalled
specialty
macros
that
arent
very
tasty
but
are
drinkable
if
nothing
else
is
available

came
with

a

with

lacing
was
patchy
but
better
than
most
michs
as
with
most
ab
products
i
cant
really
detect
an
aroma
of
anything
good
or
bad
mouthfeel
is
carbonation
and
thats
it
taste
is
light
bodied
some
grain
apparent
a
hint
of
caramel
and
enough
vague
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
into
one
of
those
drinkable
macros
that
lack
any
redeeming
qualities
other
than
being
something
you
would
drink
a
few
of
to
quench
your
thirst
much
like
drinking
colored
carbonated
water
with
enough
alcohol
to
relax
your
bones
but
not
your
soul
after
a
long
day
at
work
nice
dark
red
brownish
body
with
a
small
white
fizzy
looking
head
smell
was
a
disappointment
not
too
good
lot
of
adjuncts
slightly
on
the
skunky
side
too
i
did
drink
it
at
about
130
days
after
the
brew
date
of
course
the
born
on
label
says
best
b4
110

cmon
110

ive
bought
produce
that
lasts
longer
than
that
not
a
real
bock
weak
on
taste
and
a
thin
and
overcarbonated
mouthfeel
this
stuff
was
a
brownreddish
colour
with
a
small
white
fluffy
head
the
aromas
were
of
adjuncts
malts
and
slight
slight
hops
the
taste
followed
suit
where
are
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
a

thin

the
drinkability
was

comments

no
its
not
a
bock
but
its
drinkable
well
it
is
amber
in
fact
it
is
approaching
a
brown
thin
head
that
quickly
disappears
fairly
low
in
carbonation
smells
lightly
malty
sweet
a
fairly
good
body
on
this
beer
which
i
was
expecting
to
be
about
as
thin
as
an
american
standard
lager
though
it
by
no
means
come
close
to
the
type
of
body
that
a
bock
should
have
lightly
sweet
beer
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
balance
the
caramel
very
clean
tasting
all
around
not
much
good
or
bad
flavors
going
on
just
not
very
exciting
great
price
although
this
is
a
massproduction
beer
it
actually
has
some
intersting
properties
and
it
is
fairly
tasty
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
nutty
and
malty
but
not
strong
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
the
malts
are
detectable
in
the
flavor
surprisingly
this
is
one
of
the
best
michelob
products
i
know
of
which
went
in
badly
and
left
an
aftertaste
not
unlike
medical
waste
products
i
dont
hesitate
to
label
this
one
of
my
all
time
most
hated
beers
avoid
it
like
the
plague
i
have
no
idea
was
i
was
expecting
on
one
hand
i
thought
an
amber
bock
beer
would
be
a
great
combination
but
then
again
it
is
michelob
so
why
not
what
a
disappointment
at
first
as
the
the
beer
poured
into
my
pint
glass
i
tought
this
is
rather
odd
the
beer
poured
to
a
almost
black
body
with
a
tannish
head
almost
like
a
stout
it
did
have
good
color
but
after
that
it
went
down
hill
not
much
flavor
at
all
there
were
few
hints
of
malt
and
hops
but
nothing
to
stand
out
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
extremely
thin
for
this
style
of
beer
this
was
my
only
choice
other
than
budbud
lightmic
ultra
at
a
minor
league
game
tonight
it
poured
a
medium
tan
color
and
formed
a
foam
light
tan
head
that
left
no
lace
of
course
to
speak
of
the
aroma
very
lightly
of
malt
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
a
sweetness
i
couldnt
place
much
lighter
than
a
bock
should
be
and
shared
none
of
the
traits
you
usually
find
in
a
bock
beer
this
seems
like
standard
ab
fare
to
me
with
a
bit
of
additional
coloration
the
taste
is
standard
bud
with
a
little
more
body
and
perhaps
a
somewhat
greater
sense
of
quality
in
the
aroma
and
appearance
i
just
cant
escape
that
standard
taste
in
every
ab
product
i
sample
btb
barely
i
chose
a
pseudocraft
beer
as
my
100th
review
one
of
our
duties
as
reviewers
is
to
warn
the
unsuspecting
so
here
goes
i
sampled
this
horrible
brew
at
the
tiki
bar
an
outdoor
grill
on
the
beach
on
marco
island
michelob
was
testmarketing
amber
bock
in
several
states
and
it
was
my
misfortune
for
having
vacationed
in
florida
at
this
time
it
was
a
sunny
and
balmy
afternoon
bikini
clad
beauties
were
bouncing
around
showing
off
what
they
had
developed
over
the
winter
quite
a
distraction
from
my
relaxed
reading
and
quite
the
chore
of
appearing
disinterested
with
my
girlfriends
harsh
glare
beating
down
upon
the
back
of
my
neck
the
smell
of
grilled
shrimp
and
burgers
wafted
over
me
exciting
my
remaining
senses
i
wandered
over
to
the
tiki
and
noticed
with
curious
interest
michelob
amber
bock
on
tap
hmmm
how
bad
could
it
be
well
despite
my
most
excellent
surroundings
and
laissezfaire
attitude
the
answer
to
be
kind
is
disgusting
flat
dark
tan
in
color
and
rapidly
vanishing
offwhite
head
sweet
sugary
malt
and
soaked
corncob
aroma
the
pastymealy
malt
is
difficult
to
swallow
this
bland
sweet
tasting
lightly
hopped
beer
is
in
keeping
with
the
ab
tradition
of
marketing
over
quality
brewing
techniques
again
ab
had
the
opportunity
to
enter
the
craft
brew
market
by
brewing
a
really
fine
bock
beer
they
chose
instead
the
road
of
massproducedtype
swill
and
major
advertising
campaigns
argh
in
case
youre
still
interested
the
rest
of
my
vacation
went
very
well
despite
abs
attempt
to
ruin
it
pours
with
a
nice
amber
color
off
to
a
good
start
for
a
ab
product
a
bit
of
a
head
was
present
then
faded
to
nothing
the
aroma
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
there
is
a
present
of
roasted
malts
taste
was
a
bit
on
the
malt
side
nothing
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
was
extremely
thin
and
there
was
hardly
any
taste
not
to
bad
but
nothing
to
rave
about
nice
looking
label
and
packaging
pours
weak
with
little
head
taste
is
a
little
malty
a
little
like
chocolate
you
do
get
a
hint
of
the
touted
imported
hops
distinct
grainy
chemical
aftertaste
finish
burns
going
down
overall
not
a
very
smooth
brew
for
an
amberbock
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
when
your
choice
is
limited
just
try
to
avoid
those
situations
whenever
possible
not
that
bad
for
an
ab
product
there
was
a
time
i
probably
would
have
given
this
a
higher
rating
but
i
have
since
been
introduced
to
better
beers
still
this
beer
is
excellent
for
transitioning
a
typical
american
drinker
to
better
beers
i
used
to
drink
this
quite
often
now
i
wouldnt
bother
its
neither
a
bock
or
an
amber
more
like
a
dark
regular
lager
and
a
very
pedestrian
one
at
that
this
is
one
of
my
favs
when
it
comes
to
mass
produced
beers
from
north
america
the
apperance
was
my
favorite
part
of
it
the
color
was
a
black
color
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
and
then
got
lighter
color
as
it
descended
there
was
no
head
but
laced
the
top
with
a
light
film
the
taste
starts
out
a
little
bitter
but
smooths
out
quickly
there
was
also
some
hints
of
fruits
in
it
not
a
bad
brew
overall
tried
this
on
tap
at
red
lobster
it
was
a
bad
decision
i
should
have
known
it
was
a
very
clear
brown
color
with
very
little
head
there
wasnt
much
aroma
maybe
some
toasted
malts
with
a
little
sweetness
the
taste
seemed
watered
down
couldve
been
the
glass
but
i
doubt
it
it
seemed
to
taste
a
lot
like
bud
only
sweeter
the
mouthfeel
was
extremely
thin
and
there
was
hardly
any
taste
thats
what
i
get
for
going
with
ab
still
i
would
choose
it
over
bud
when
its
my
only
other
choice
it
pours
a
clear
brown
body
with
a
dull
orange
cast
and
ruby
highlights
the
short
but
creamy
offwhite
head
drops
readily
but
keeps
a
creamy
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
it
laces
nicely
as
you
drink
but
all
that
sticks
to
the
glass
is
some
spotty
lace
still
the
appearance
is
quite
enjoyable
the
nose
expresses
a
mildly
sweet
and
lightly
toasty
malt
with
some
mild
floral
and
spicy
hops
deep
in
the
background
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
very
fine
carbonation
that
gently
caresses
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
delicately
balanced
between
a
lightly
sweet
gently
toasty
malt
and
a
restrained
bitterness
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
a
light
touch
of
residual
toasted
maltiness
very
nicely
done
exceptionally
clean
wellbalanced
and
quite
drinkable
with
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
for
those
whove
moved
beyond
american
lagers
well
worth
trying
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
caramel
highlights
that
is
crystal
clear
offwhite
head
has
large
bubbles
and
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
malt
and
caramel
showing
a
touch
of
sweetness
caramel
is
very
prevalent
on
the
taste
with
a
touch
of
malt
and
hops
for
balance
minimal
sweetness
but
very
smooth
this
is
the
best
macro
offering
ive
had
nothing
exceptional
in
the
flavor
but
definitely
not
offensive
by
any
means
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
especially
for
something
termed
a
bock
beer
carbonation
is
a
touch
agressive
leading
to
a
harsh
mouthfeel
as
well
drinkability
is
good
year
round
a
solid
beer
for
16case
here
in
pa
this
offering
is
a
great
example
of
a
beer
brewed
not
to
offend
anyone
but
giving
the
appearance
that
it
is
a
micro
handcrafted
beer
it
pours
an
amber
brown
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
sticks
around
only
for
a
bit
at
first
the
aroma
actually
has
malty
notes
typical
of
a
lesser
maibock
along
with
some
hop
spiciness
thrown
in
the
taste
however
is
bland
and
watered
down
with
the
green
apple
bud
flavor
very
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
also
too
weak
for
the
style
i
am
not
sure
what
the
target
consumer
is
for
this
beer
but
it
clearly
is
too
dark
for
the
bud
light
crowd
and
too
bland
for
anyone
that
appreciates
micros
i
sample
michelob
amber
bock
from
a
12
oz
amber
bottle
it
poured
to
give
an
amber
beer
with
some
white
foam
the
color
looked
a
little
odd
to
me
it
was
not
a
true
amber
color
but
was
slightly
brown
there
was
an
aroma
of
sweetness
and
malt
but
it
did
not
smell
like
a
bock
the
taste
was
thin
but
was
sweet
with
very
little
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
of
carbonation
and
the
beer
seemed
thin
the
drinkability
is
ok
for
this
type
but
again
this
is
not
really
a
bock
beer
i
hope
people
dont
take
this
beer
to
be
any
different
than
another
macro
big
beer
not
a
good
amber
beer
not
a
good
bock
good
macro
session
beer
at
best
this
beats
most
of
the
regular
lagers
out
there
but
would
rate
as
one
of
the
worst
bock
beers
although
im
not
sure
if
it
is
a
real
bock
a
good
introductory
dark
beer
for
macro
drinkers
a
total
rereview
of
what
was
once
considered
a
decent
beverage
a
medium
red
in
color
strong
skunky
masky
odor
of
corn
and
veggies
the
initial
taste
is
of
watered
down
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
faint
hops
left
in
the
background
easy
going
down
but
overall
a
bad
taste
personal
notes
better
than
average
pick
when
there
are
no
micros
i
noted
that
they
use
rice
which
probably
lightened
the
body
of
this
unfortunately
no
corn
thank
goodness
i
would
buy
this
if
i
was
looking
for
a
reasonably
priced
macro
for
whatever
reason
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
this
is
an
average
beer
nothing
to
complexes
nothing
to
simple
this
beer
has
a
firm
smallish
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
while
that
has
some
malt
character
to
it
the
aroma
is
nothing
to
be
impressed
with
it
also
has
a
nice
body
a
little
thin
but
what
do
you
expect
from
ab
good
color
nice
amber
hue
could
be
a
little
darker
nice
smooth
taste
not
very
heavy
on
the
malt
flavor
light
hops
a
little
creamy
and
a
little
smokey
nice
bold
aftertaste
a
little
dry
but
refreshing
a
good
showing
from
ab
but
a
little
hard
to
find
and
if
you
have
to
hunt
it
down
its
not
worth
it
fight
the
good
fight
shiner
this
brew
is
not
amber
has
gone
well
beyond
that
i
did
like
this
dark
lager
even
though
this
type
of
brew
is
basically
foreign
to
me
after
i
got
by
the
appearance
the
taste
i
found
to
be
very
mellow
and
well
balanced
i
thank
ba
for
perking
my
interest
to
trying
all
these
new
brews
murky
brown
color
a
little
deeper
than
clear
thin
offwhite
to
tan
head
some
beer
like
malt
smells
matched
with
toasted
corn
taste
is
midly
maltly
although
hard
to
distinguish
which
are
used
thin
feeling
and
somewhat
watery
finish
semisweet
finish
lingers
but
doesnt
disrupt
the
taste
buds
i
drank
it
fast
anticipating
a
hard
to
handle
slick
funky
ab
finish
but
it
was
not
that
bad
actually
i
found
it
better
than
i
had
anticipated
is
neither
an
amber
or
a
bock
though
just
a
catchy
name
for
a
dark
lager
im
not
sure
that
its
not
artificially
colored
too
still
better
than
ordering
some
things
on
tap
in
florida
certainly
not
a
german
bock
but
a
pretty
exotic
brew
from
ab
i
held
off
for
a
long
time
to
try
this
and
finally
broke
down
and
broke
a
sixer
for
one
it
was
worth
my
effort
how
about
yours
pours
to
a
mediumbrown
colow
with
an
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
is
one
of
light
malt
no
hop
aroma
was
detected
the
taste
is
light
roast
malt
with
a
slight
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
smooth
and
carbonic
overall
this
beer
is
light
in
every
aspect
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
it
however
is
sad
that
they
try
to
market
it
as
a
bock
should
not
be
associated
with
a
bock
it
would
be
very
misleading
to
a
novice
beer
drinker
looking
to
try
a
real
bock
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
caramel
color
with
absolutely
no
head
the
smell
contains
maybe
a
hint
of
light
malt
with
a
skunk
being
dominant
fortunately
doesnt
taste
as
bad
as
it
smells
quite
bland
with
faint
notes
of
earthy
grain
and
lightly
hopped
almost
none
and
plenty
of
carb
bite
very
plain
for
such
a
fancy
label
very
light
bodied
and
finishes
very
crisp
and
clean
fairly
drinkable
if
you
dont
smell
first
ab
is
so
scared
they
are
going
to
put
flavor
in
something
when
i
get
through
this
fancy
variety
pack
of
bland
beer
no
more
ab
for
me
cheers
the
last
of
my
sampler
pack
was
pretty
unimpressive
the
body
is
lacking
it
is
thin
and
short
on
flavor
there
are
some
malts
hanging
around
but
not
too
much
to
it
something
to
make
a
macro
drinker
feel
fancy
as
far
as
this
being
a
mass
produced
beer
it
wasnt
a
bad
attempt
atleast
they
are
trying
the
color
was
really
the
only
thing
good
about
this
beer
dark
ruby
molassas
in
color
the
head
and
lace
were
almost
nonexistent
the
smell
was
slightly
floral
and
malty
but
really
nonexistent
the
flavor
had
a
malt
slight
caramelmolassas
floral
carbonation
taste
to
it
i
asked
a
buddy
to
try
a
sip
and
he
is
a
coors
man
and
said
that
it
wasnt
bad
for
michelob
i
agree
not
bad
for
michelob
medium
amber
weak
head
and
lace
lighter
than
i
think
it
should
be
slightly
syruppy
sweet
and
spritzy
husky
corn
like
finish
totally
lacking
in
body
obviously
mean
to
give
lawnmower
beer
drinkers
the
impression
they
are
drinkingn
something
sophisticated
goes
down
smooth
however
it
is
easily
abs
best
attempt
my
verdict
a
good
ab
product
i
find
it
amusing
that
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
specialty
brew
and
the
label
explicity
says
that
it
is
brewed
with
rice
try
making
an
all
malt
brew
next
time
ab
my
first
michelob
i
expected
more
i
think
it
pours
dark
brown
with
a
good
fluffy
highcarbon
tan
head
a
bit
week
on
lace
i
found
the
body
of
the
beer
week
as
well
its
a
drinkable
beer
for
its
very
smooth
sweet
malty
taste
over
little
hop
afterfeel
of
mouth
is
dry
but
waterlike
in
finish
as
others
have
said
it
is
an
above
average
beer
and
should
be
tried
before
discounting
it
because
it
is
made
by
ab
dark
amber
in
color
with
moderate
carbonation
and
head
slightly
alcohol
aroma
which
i
deducted
points
for
but
the
flavor
had
a
tinge
of
malt
which
i
enjoyed
it
could
use
more
though
for
the
bock
name
can
usually
be
found
fairly
cheap
which
makes
it
all
the
more
drinkable
somewhat
thinner
than
it
could
be
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
my
friends
like
to
criticize
on
this
beer
but
i
think
its
a
decent
well
made
brew
a
touch
more
maltiness
would
help
but
ive
found
it
solidly
enjoyable
nothing
all
that
special
but
i
believe
this
to
be
an
above
average
beer
i
had
it
on
draught
which
is
probably
why
i
think
that
nice
dark
color
with
little
head
some
bitterness
in
the
flavor
but
i
was
just
appreciative
that
there
was
flavor
unbelievably
whitebread
it
is
difficult
to
even
find
anything
to
comment
on
i
am
not
an
expert
on
bocks
but
hopefully
this
is
not
the
norm
too
plain
for
anyone
but
regular
michelob
drinkers
who
feel
like
they
are
taking
a
risk
i
have
to
admit
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
even
though
it
comes
from
anheiser
busch
this
is
well
balanced
with
a
little
malty
feel
to
it
a
nice
aroma
and
a
doable
head
that
laces
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
prost
nice
and
dark
tan
head
that
slightly
roasted
on
the
nose
with
some
fruit
thinner
then
i
expected
not
ovelry
carbonated
which
is
refreshing
one
of
the
better
beers
out
of
ab
whats
this
an
ab
product
that
actually
has
some
taste
ill
be
damned
dark
amberbrown
lots
of
bubbles
dissipating
white
head
not
much
aroma
at
all
taste
is
not
unpleasant
with
a
sweet
malty
caramel
flavor
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
leads
to
bloating
overall
however
not
as
bad
as
you
might
otherwise
expect
from
these
guys
its
easy
to
drink
but
not
worth
the
premium
price
it
has
that
classic
anheuserbusch
blandness
and
mediocrity
attributable
to
the
neutral
house
yeast
they
use
no
doubt
nothing
strips
the
soul
from
malted
barley
as
completely
as
ab
house
lager
yeast
and
a
tight
series
of
filters
there
is
such
a
small
hint
of
roasted
malt
character
that
if
you
are
not
concentrating
you
may
miss
so
if
you
are
eating
spicy
food
engaged
in
stimulating
conversation
or
otherwise
distracted
you
will
miss
the
shadow
of
the
character
remaining
in
this
beer
and
you
might
as
well
be
drinking
regular
michelob
clear
dark
brown
color
bigbubbled
adjunct
head
foams
down
in
short
order
sharp
acidic
odor
much
like
most
lighter
colored
macro
lagers
just
the
slightest
hint
of
roasted
malt
flavor
touch
of
anise
and
sweetness
but
very
soon
attenuated
by
a
crisp
but
nondescript
hop
and
adjunct
flavor
very
little
body
or
mouthfeel
aftertaste
is
nuetral
rather
than
smacking
of
bittercrisp
carbonated
water
flavor
nothing
to
recommend
it
but
the
color
at
about
a
buck
or
so
less
a
sixer
than
a
standard
micro
not
even
a
good
value
light
brown
in
color
typically
clear
from
the
lagering
filtering
fining
whatever
the
head
settles
very
quickly
into
a
thin
and
unappetizing
layer
the
aroma
is
very
mild
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
becomes
present
only
as
the
beer
warms
bland
but
clean
in
flavor
an
unexpected
light
munich
malt
toasted
flavor
becomes
noticeable
after
the
prickly
overly
effervsecent
mouthfeel
subsides
corn
sweetness
is
thankfully
minimal
there
is
no
hop
flavor
whatsoever
but
hop
bitterness
is
definitely
above
the
norm
for
an
american
macrobrew
finishes
very
dry
and
neutral
this
is
about
as
much
a
bock
as
shiner
bock
is
well
there
arent
any
flaws
in
this
brew
its
weak
but
super
clean
all
around
in
profile
and
ill
take
it
over
any
other
american
dark
lager
anyday
theres
actually
more
than
caramal
coloring
added
to
this
one
wont
ever
order
it
again
however
not
to
shabby
for
ab
a
bock
though
i
dont
think
so
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
very
refreshing
brew
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
clean
taste
not
bad
at
all
i
would
say
the
best
from
ab
that
i
have
had
so
far
any
so
called
premium
that
sports
a
label
trumpeting
the
fact
they
use
rice
in
the
beer
should
be
taken
behind
the
shed
and
shot
it
looks
like
a
rich
dark
beer
but
its
an
illusion
its
a
pale
imitation
of
a
dark
beer
with
that
grainy
bud
aftertaste
pass
on
it
a
chemical
type
tastes
that
just
didnt
seem
right
began
making
themselves
known
and
that
was
the
end
of
my
amber
bock
days
i
like
this
beer
its
a
bit
thin
but
it
has
a
nice
somewhat
sweet
malty
taste
to
it
more
of
a
dark
lager
than
a
bock
i
know
its
customary
to
pile
on
the
big
brewers
but
in
this
case
i
think
ab
has
done
a
nice
job
this
may
very
well
be
abs
best
offering
i
had
the
same
impression
that
the
other
guys
had
that
this
is
definitely
not
an
all
malt
beer
not
a
beer
to
taste
by
itself
needs
pretzels
popcorn
salted
cashews
or
something
had
this
stuff
in
tampa
go
figure
started
out
a
session
with
it
at
an
outdoor
downtown
happy
hour
festival
it
was
the
lesser
of
the
evil
swill
tasted
like
runnings
from
overboiled
mixed
vegetables
it
served
its
purpose
i
suppose
other
than
that
this
is
typical
of
what
ab
thinks
a
specialty
brew
is
ugh
crystal
clear
dark
brown
amber
has
a
standard
dirty
alchoholic
scent
like
rice
crispies
or
cherios
reminds
me
a
lot
of
regular
michalob
or
coors
a
slight
roasted
malt
flavor
clean
finish
no
character
absolutely
no
complexity
made
with
the
finest
barley
hops
water
yeast
and
rice
wow
ive
got
rice
grandeur
in
my
beer
it
kind
of
looks
like
a
beer
and
it
kind
of
smells
like
a
beer
but
it
tastes
like
michelob
with
caramel
coloring
added
i
guess
that
is
what
makes
it
go
down
so
smooth
sarcasm
i
had
this
at
busch
gardens
tampa
bay
slightly
bitter
and
as
the
name
implies
amber
in
color
not
bad
for
ab
certainly
better
than
the
king
of
beers
or
anything
else
ive
tried
from
them
nice
to
know
that
ab
is
trying
to
improve
its
products
but
much
more
is
needed
no
discernable
hops
other
than
a
vague
bitterness
finish
was
a
raw
grain
character
primary
flavoring
agent
seemed
to
be
alcohol
run
will
robinson
run
overall
suprising
beer
but
not
necessarily
true
to
style
lighter
feel
and
much
sweeter
than
other
bocks
ive
had
in
the
past
not
by
any
means
a
bad
beer
and
i
will
have
it
again
just
not
what
i
expected
from
a
bock
dreaming
if
they
werent
constrained
to
the
german
purity
laws
i
wonder
what
a
smoked
version
of
this
or
a
barrel
aged
version
of
this
would
yield
overall
a
spicy
sweet
and
clean
bock
with
a
light
feel
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
dark
red
brown
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
earth
spice
and
dark
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
cream
nutty
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
average
brew
this
one
really
seemed
quite
bland
if
i
am
honest
all
of
the
right
notes
were
there
but
they
seemed
to
just
mix
together
rather
than
work
in
unison
to
enhance
each
other
really
disappointed
in
this
one
i
suggest
you
try
it
at
least
once
but
i
would
stop
at
that
if
it
were
me
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
others
to
try
it
has
more
flavor
than
the
traditional
red
oak
from
notes
12012
this
is
a
fairly
simple
onedimensional
beer
it
is
a
nice
twist
on
your
usual
bock
but
theres
very
little
to
get
excited
about
beyond
that
it
was
good
to
try
once
but
i
probably
wont
have
it
again
i
picked
this
one
because
compared
to
red
oaks
other
offerings
i
thought
it
had
the
biggest
tasteflavor
o
great
beer
by
a
smal
local
brewer
that
is
really
doing
it
right
it
seems
pours
a
moderate
to
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
brings
some
good
roast
characteristics
as
well
as
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
quite
roasty
especially
for
the
style
but
i
think
it
works
out
here
good
body
with
solid
dryness
drinks
fairly
well
id
never
heard
of
them
before
but
this
was
a
decent
brew
the
beer
pours
a
deep
brownnear
black
color
minimal
carbonation
and
a
small
light
brown
head
with
very
little
retention
as
i
have
seen
as
characteristic
of
most
beers
of
its
style
but
overall
a
great
appearance
smells
of
deep
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
minimal
alcohol
notes
robust
hops
and
a
dash
of
coffee
taste
of
roasted
malts
with
sweet
chocolaty
depth
of
a
chocolate
milk
shake
with
some
coffee
undertones
taste
balanced
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
to
offset
the
heavy
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
above
the
consistency
of
most
beer
and
very
very
smooth
with
a
normal
abv
for
its
style
it
is
going
to
be
very
strong
for
the
modest
beer
drinker
but
perfect
for
those
that
believe
in
a
good
robust
flavored
beer
first
of
all
i
can
hardly
believe
that
this
is
a
bock
beer
the
tap
was
simply
identified
as
battlefield
and
i
did
not
realize
it
was
another
local
red
oak
offering
i
thought
for
sure
that
this
was
a
stout
never
had
a
bock
that
was
this
creamy
and
sweet
nonetheless
this
is
a
thick
dark
brown
color
brew
poured
at
the
greensboro
national
golf
course
clubhouse
with
a
velvetty
thick
light
browntan
head
and
gobs
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
chocolate
milshake
with
a
hint
of
sweet
coffee
and
hop
bitterness
the
flavor
is
a
little
more
coffee
but
not
terribly
bitter
more
like
coffee
ice
cream
smooth
somewhat
aqueous
lightly
carbonated
very
easy
drinking
just
enough
tartness
to
make
this
sweet
brew
quite
satisfying
well
done
definitely
opens
the
window
a
bit
where
bock
beers
are
concerned
battlefield
bock
is
my
first
brew
from
red
oak
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
the
beer
in
hand
is
medium
in
body
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
very
easy
drinker
nice
brew
reminds
of
a
shwartz
beer
a
little
i
liked
it
better
2
years
ago
something
in
the
recipe
has
changed
oh
heres
the
problem
the
battlefield
black
turned
into
battlefield
bock
black
pour
whitish
head
very
smooth
and
drinkable
dark
chocolate
maltmolasses
all
very
subtle
nothing
jumps
out
could
preobably
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
when
i
was
in
germany
most
of
the
beers
were
pretty
tame
so
all
and
all
this
is
not
bad
and
representative
of
what
i
had
there
i
like
this
beer
red
oak
puts
out
some
quality
beers
in
my
mind
and
this
one
is
quite
the
example
not
bad
i
liked
the
flavors
at
work
here
for
a
bock
beer
but
i
wish
that
the
taste
and
body
had
given
up
a
little
more
overall
this
still
drank
pretty
good
and
complimented
our
meal
well
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
can
be
improved
upon
nice
to
see
someone
added
this
i
had
it
a
few
weeks
back
at
backstreets
here
in
greensboro
came
to
the
table
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thinner
tan
colore
head
atopmainly
chocolate
malt
aromas
in
the
nose
a
bit
of
breadiness
as
well
not
much
hop
trace
flavors
also
lean
heavily
in
the
chocolate
category
with
some
doughy
notes
and
a
light
shot
of
spicey
hop
in
the
finish
its
pretty
thin
for
the
style
in
my
mind
the
flavors
are
decent
but
all
in
all
its
pretty
average
not
like
most
bocks
ive
had
but
you
can
definitely
taste
the
chocolate
taste
overall
a
nice
bock
probably
note
what
most
texans
expect
from
a
bock
given
their
shiner
experiences
but
this
seems
close
to
what
the
rest
of
the
world
thinks
of
as
a
bock
there
is
a
bit
of
candy
note
that
goes
off
and
pulls
down
the
total
scores
for
me
but
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
revolver
bock
by
revolver
brewing
has
a
strong
mahogany
color
and
a
dense
head
the
smells
nutty
and
somewhat
like
chocolate
which
while
pleasant
isnt
similar
to
the
style
the
taste
is
a
rich
toasted
toffee
like
taste
that
feels
very
strongly
towards
he
malt
with
little
to
no
taste
coming
from
hops
every
gulp
and
sip
is
rich
and
full
bodied
with
nice
amounts
of
carbonation
overall
revolver
bock
is
a
pleasant
american
ale
with
decent
drinkability
even
if
it
isnt
very
inline

what

the

a

the
bock

out
a
nice
light

color
with
a
nice
off

head
this
brew
smells
sweet
with
grains
and
malts
you
also
pick
up

at

the

is
bold

genesee

genesee

dundee
brewing
co
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
love
this
beer
mainly
for
the
can
but
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
good
too
so
much
better
than
all
other
genny
beers
i
always
wait
and
buy
a
few
cases
every
year
pours
a
wonderful
copper
brown
has
hues
of
amber
and
gold
and
has
a
creamy
persistent
head
of
off
white
foam
nose
is
malty
soft
round
bready
malt
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
no
hops
scent
except
for
the
idea
of
grass
theres
corn
on
this
nose
as
its
part
of
the
malt
character
but
it
does
not
smell
like
corny
sweetness
it
has
a
light
scent
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
excellent
clean
a
touch
sweet
with
a
bit
of
caramel
has
no
hop
flavors
really
excellent
and
no
bitterness
form
hops
either
they
are
a
part
of
the
mouthfeel
though
as
they
dry
on
the
palate
lightly
in
the
crisp
finish
the
corn
does
lighten
the
flavor
while
it
is
not
excessively
sweet
in
the
finish
its
crisp
just
dry
and
lingers
softly
and
sweetly
not
cloying
nodiacetyl
which
is
often
just
a
slickness
without
a
heavy
buttery
taste
and
has
no
alcohol
on
the
palate
the
only
criticism
i
have
is
that
i
think
the
corn
keeps
it
from
being
as
malty
rich
as
it
might
have
been
without
it
but
it
is
very
well
done
and
adds
lightness
to
the
flavor
and
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
is
thinner
side
of
medium
12oz
can
into
a
pint

very
cool
can

btw
pours
a
crystal
clear
darkish
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
poor
head
retention
and
lacing
but
i
really
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
to
out
of
this
beer
aroma
has
burnt
caramel
toffee
and
some
molasses
perhaps
a
touch
of
corn
as
well
more
caramel
on
the
taste
along
with
molasses
and
a
quick
whiff
of
alcohol
light
corn
with
a
little
grassy
hop
character
slightly
sticky
with
very
little
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
a
thin
mouthfeel
overall
while
this
is
far
from
a
great
beer
or
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
is
very
refreshing
and
quite
tasty
considering
the
price
a
beer
i
like
to
pick
up
every
spring
o
a
decent
bock
beer
that
hits
all
the
right
marks
they
only
bring
it
out
in
january
and
its
worth
stocking
up
a
12
pack
or
two
if
you
like
this
style
oi
didnt
expect
much
because
its
genesee
but
it
is
a
smidgen
better
than
what
i
expected
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
upfront
with
a
slight
moderate
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
while
not
as
strong
abv
as
some
i
have
had
i
happen
to
like
this
one
and
find
it
to
be
very
drinkable
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
most
people
equate
genesee
with
crap
beer
and
yes
a
lot
of
their
beers
are
cheap
swill
however
this
brew
isnt
its
on
the
light
side
for
a
bock
but
has
good
flavor
and
very
drinkable
this
is
certainly
a
sessionable
beer
and
any
bock
or
strong
lager
fans
should
try
it
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
poured
out
as
a
brownish
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
the
lacing
and
retention
were
minimal
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
malty
some
earthy
hops
and
yesterday
on
the
nose
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
malty
toasted
and
had
a
good
amount
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
gently
carbonated
overall
this
a
decent
bock
overy
pleasant
worth
drinking
good
way
to
welcome
in
the
spring
and
it
is
my
super
bowl
beer
of
choice
most
people
wouldnt
expect
this
caliber
of
beer
when
the
see
the
genesee
name
on
it
it
is
not
the
best
beer
or
bock
in
the
world
by
a
long
shot
but
i
challenge
you
to
do
any
better
for
the
money
this
was
actually
a
solid
offering
from
genesee
i
honestly
would
say
it
has
a
bit
more
character
than
shiner
bock
you
cant
beat
this
beer
for
the
price
awesome
beer
for
the
price
good
flavor
and
drinkability
definitely
worth
a
try
o
this
beer
is
really
easy
drink
and
ive
certainly
had
worse
light
on
the
wallet
at
7
50
for
a
12
pack
you
get
a
great
bang
for
your
buck
with
this
beer
and
it
may
turn
in
to
my
goto
session
beer
from
now
on
much
better
than
the
pisswater
this
is
a
classic
seasonal
in
western
ny
its
nothing
super
special
but
still
pretty
tasty
anyway
notes
appearance
is
nice
aroma
is
good
taste
is
a
disappointment
its
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
fresh
taste
it
tastes
even
better
as
tonight
blizzard
rages
on
there
is
no
bad
aftertaste
its
clean
and
you
can
drink
it
with
anything
or
by
itself
i
find
that
all
of
the
genny
beers
have
their
own
taste
which
is
a
good
thing
i
like
a
cheap
beer
that
is
pleasant
to
drink
at
any
time
o
ive
enjoyed
it
for
many
years
its
a
genuinely
good
bock
and
for
the
price
its
simply
outstanding
highly
recommended
for
anyone
looking
for
a
high
flavortocost
ratio
cheers
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
light
easy
drinking
and
pretty
flavorful
it
was
a
decent
beer
of
the
style
as
well
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
overall
id
choose
it
over
other
similarly
priced
lighter
beer
o
a
beer
lovers
alternative
to
shiner
bock
not
quite
as
poundable
but
plenty
refreshing
and
flavorful
stands
up
well
to
calamari
id
also
happily
pair
with
a
lightly
battered
fish
and
chips
or
wings
well
done

this
is
surprisingly
good

genny
ive
been
drinking

all

coming
from
northern
pa
and
this
is
the
first
one
ive
truly
enjoyed
it
has
flavor

a
high

of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
the
tiniest
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
big
sweet
bready
malt
hit
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
with
surprisingly
little
carbonation
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
its
a
little
onenote
but
that
note
is
played
surprisingly
well
probably
the
best
price
performer
i
have
ever
had
13
07
for
a
case
of
24
cans
just
wish
it
was
available
for
a
longer
period
in
pa
limited
supply
this
year
supposedly
because
they
have
decided
to
keg
a
large
portion
of
the
seasons
supply
i
bought
every
case
that
my
local
distributor
had
all
4
he
mentioned
some
people
arent
going
to
be
happy
with
me
very
consistent
from
year
to
year
decent
mouth
feel
very
malty
not
much
hop
presence
but
for
what
it
is
its
worth
very
penny
those
who
like
yuengling
lager
wil
enjoy
his
may
be
bit
sweet
for
some
if
you
can
find
it
buy
it
great
session
beer
overall
impression
this
beer
is
an
enjoyable
but
average
bock
style
beer
that
has
one
big
thing
going
for
it
cost
it
cost
about
7
bucks
for
the
12er
this
is
probably
a
beer
that
will
go
into
the
rotation
simply
for
this
reason
maybe
bock
beers
are
just
not
for
me
overall
pretty
good
beer
one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
had
from
genesee
at
the
price
point
definetly
worth
checking
out
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
beer
it
was
8
99
for
a
12pack
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
its
not
the
best
bock
out
there
but
for
a
simple
and
flavorful
beer
that
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
the
price
is
right
for
this
one
overall
this
as
by
far
the
finest
offering
from
the
genesee
brewing
company
and
one
that
i
wish
i
could
get
all
the
time
it
would
easily
replace
my
regular
swill
of
choice
and
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
with
the
grandma
appearance
of
the
green
goated
can
o
the
easiest
of
drinkers
smooth
overall
beer
and
for
8
a
12
pack
its
really
one
of
the
best
buys
on
the
market
o
fear
the
goat
a
local
treasure
that
is
an
early
sign
of
spring
being
that
it
is
still
january
in
western
ny
they
may
have
jumped
the
gun
on
this
one
but
bless
them
for
trying
overall
its
a
nice
beer
no
complaints
decent
enough
malt
profile
easy
drinking
and
cmon
that
is
one
pretty
sweet
can
that
its
coming
out
of
it
has
a
great
feel
in
your
mouth
and
is
very
refreshing
this
bock
is
really
surpprising
and
really
good
i
give
it
an
overal
of
4
give
this
one
a
try
when
you
can
you
will
like
it
at
a
nice
price
of
15
00
for
a
case
of
cans
reviewed
from
notes
enjoyed
many
times
now
formally
reviewed
for
the
first
time
poured
from
12oz
can
into
dimpled
glass
mug
pours
a
rich
but
bubbly
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
half
inch
thick
head
taste
of
malt
is
good
and
present
throughout
but
never
heavy
thanks
to
the
carbonation
before
finishing
crisp
and
clean
this
is
a
good
bock
for
the
price
and
a
style
i
wish
i
could
get
year
round
especially
this
one
as
the
price
for
a
12
is
great
and
good
as
a
session
probably
my
favorite
from
genesee
next
to
the
more
common
genesee
cream
ale
solid
bock
beer
for
the
price
and
surprisingly
not
watery
the
can
artwork
is
also
great
once
referred
to
as
grandma
beer
by
a
bud
light
drinking
party
goer
who
saw
me
drinking
the
funny
cans
o
this
beer
has
a
clean
light
flavor
but
there
are
nice
hints
of
bock
beer
the
big
fizz
and
sulfur
grow
a
bit
to
strong
as
the
beer
opens
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
interesting
enough
that
its
worth
your
while
and
the
fact
that
you
can
get
it
at
67
cents
a
can
really
makes
this
a
worthy
investment
a
truly
great
value
beer
also
the
robust
portly
character
of
the
can
with
an
almost
comedic
decoration
adds
to
the
fun
that
this
beer
proffers
overall
this
beer
was
a
huge
surprise
when
i
first
tried
it
a
couple
months
ago
it
was
the
price
and
not
the
dreadful
packaging
that
turned
my
head
and
made
me
pick
up
a
twelve
pack998please
its
been
my
goto
beer
ever
since
great
stuff
taste
is
mostly
nearbunt
malt
without
much
sweetness
in
tow
dry
even
finish
without
much
if
any
hop
character
one
of
the
better
brews
i
have
had
from
the
geneseedundee
lineup
compared
to
shiner
bock
this
one
is
not
as
crisp
and
clean
but
it
has
a
more
pronounced
malt
flavor
and
body
not
too
shabby
of
a
brewski
here
id
drink
it
again
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
enough
brew
and
a
great
buy
for
the
price
12pk

tastewatery

faint

more
character
and
flavor
than
bmc
brews
very
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
not
unpleasant
and
a
step
up
from
your
runofthemill
bmc
the
aroma
was
your
classic
malty
bock
nice
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
aromas
mixed
in
with
a
good
earthy
tone
the
flavor
followed
through
very
closely
with
a
nice
bitter
malty
flavor
and
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
in
it
as
well
carbonation
that
is
more
then
decent
never
let
it
go
flat
and
kept
you
entertained
throughout
the
session
easily
a
sessionable
beer
as
i
could
have
thrown
down
more
then
one
overall
milder
and
gentler
than
most
but
gains
a
boosted
drinkability
from
the
lower
level
of
alcohol
and
the
crisperthanmost
level
of
carbonation
and
its
cheap
if
im
paying
only
2
75
at
a
restaurant
a
sixer
of
the
stuff
in
stores
should
be
pretty
reasonable
i
try
not
to
judge
beers
based
only
on
the
price
but
this
one
gets
high
marks
for
being
an
unbelievable
value
i
was
drawn
in
by
the
cute
retro
packaging
and
the
price
however
i
was
extremely
surprised
when
i
first
tried
this
its
the
first
year
ive
seen
it
available
in
my
area
and
ive
turned
on
a
lot
of
my
friends
to
this
brew
ive
probably
bought
five
or
six
12
packs
of
this
since
i
found
it
in
february
im
already
mourning
the
end
of
goat
season
overall
a
quality
seasonal
macro
offering
along
with
shiner
one
of
the
original
american
bock
beers
at
6
9912pack
this
is
a
great
bargain
and
good
goto
spring
offering
really
awesome
camping
beer
overall
for
the
price
of
8
a
12
pack
quite
great
i
pick
this
as
my
favorite
canned
beer
like
i
said
for
the
price
and
if
you
are
even
thinking
of
liking
a
gennee
brew
this
is
good
d
session
beer
nuff
said
this
is
a
historical
favorite
of
mine
drank
this
before
i
knew
what
quality
craft
beers
were
d
a
pretty
average
bock
reasonably
priced
and
probably
the
best
beer
made
by
genesee
ive
ever
had
but
if
youre
a
bock
fan
there
are
better
choices
looks
great
pouring
a
deep
copper
color
with
quick
to
fade
head
smells
of
malt
and
faint
hopsnothing
overwhelming
taste
is
great
malt
dominates
with
nice
bitter
hoppiness
goes
down
easy
and
would
be
a
great
beer
with
food
tremendous
value
hats
off
to
genny
with
all
due
respect
to
genesee
this
beer
almost
seems
better
than
it
has
any
right
to
be
it
is
ridiculously
cheap
yet
it
is
legitimately
good
the
price
to
quality
ratio
for
this
beer
makes
me
genuinely
giddy
when
it
finally
reaches
rhode
island
this
year
i
am
going
to
buy
cases
i
desire
more
of
this
sweet
biscuit
corn
soda
this
isnt
the
most
balanced
bock
out
there
or
the
most
flavorful
but
its
not
one
to
pass
up
either
not
an
impressive
finish
but
a
fine
and
easilysessioned
beer
and
a
great
value
and
the
can
design
is
retrohip
at
one
time
this
was
considered
the
best
bock
beer
in
america
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
every
spring
dhigh
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
candidate
d
nice
drinkability
easy
to
drink
and
very
cheap
with
the
exception
of
the
carbonation
being
way
too
high
for
my
liking
this
beer
is
pretty
good
very
easy
to
drink
exspecially
for
10
a
12
pack
the
only
time
i
would
buy
this
again
would
be
for
something
cheap
to
play
drinking
games
with
or
go
to
a
party
d
very
drinkable
unassuming
and
undemanding
makes
me
wish
it
were
april
overall
i
think
we
have
a
winner
here
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
at
lower
than
bmc
prices
consider
it
a
macro
beer
that
actually
has
some
subtle
complexity
and
is
brewed
to
a
style
other
than
american
pilsner
im
going
to
buy
this
again
for
sure
worth
waiting
for
unfortunately
genesee
keeps
the
bock
season
way
too
short
drinks
easy
starting
improving
once
near
ale
serving
temp
a
nice
american
regional
take
on
the
style
would
happily
kill
a
sixer
of
this
during
a
game
or
bbq
flavor
really
picked
up
once
warm
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
bronze
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
caramel
taste
is
rather
mild
some
malts
a
hint
of
caramel
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
decent
beer
d
i
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
i
understand
the
pricing
on
this
is
very
agreeable
as
well
good
show
d
again
and
for
the
last
time
this
is
a
612
pack
beer
a
great
beer
for
the
money
or
a
good
beer
in
general
and
spot
on
for
the
rather
forgotten
style
of
20th
century
american
bock
beers
i
plan
to
stockpile
next
january
on
this
onceayear
and
unusually
affordable
treat
a
nearperfect
session
beer
d
surpassed
my
expectations
as
a
modest
abv
bock
with
good
lager
qualities
and
a
slightly
sweet
and
smoky
malty
profile
love
the
artwork
on
the
can
like
the
contents
a
little
bit
less
serviceable
though
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
a
faint
amount
of
malt
and
thats
about
it
its
a
rather
dark
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
in
my
goblet
the
taste
is
of
faint
maltyness
in
the
front
and
all
the
way
through
with
no
backbone
to
this
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
and
for
the
price
6
49
for
a
12
pack
its
a
good
beer
to
have
after
uve
already
had
some
real
good
beer
and
want
just
one
more
the
tastes
arent
amazing
but
for
the
price
they
know
what
kind
of
beer
it
is
if
you
can
get
ur
hands
of
a
12
pack
id
advise
because
it
will
last
you
a
long
time
and
you
wont
regret
it
d
well
what
can
i
say
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
this
has
a
lot
of
character
awesome
looking
can
too
picked
up
a
24pk
from
bell
beverage
for
10
wow
12oz
can
poured
into
a
mug
pours
a
darker
amber
with
12
tan
foamy
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
aroma
isnt
all
that
impressive
just
some
general
malt
sweetness
in
the
taste
i
get
some
subtle
chocolatemolasses
character
and
some
metallic
flavor
which
is
odd
very
soft
carbonation
and
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
a
great
value
for
such
a
modestlypriced
brew
i
heard
that
theres
a
lot
of
love
for
genny
bock
so
i
picked
up
a
single
the
beer
im
reviewing
right
now
came
from
a
case
that
i
picked
up
for
a
15
50
love
that
it
comes
in
cans
love
the
look
of
the
cans
and
love
the
look
in
the
glass
this
being
a
lower
level
beer
i
would
not
be
against
sipping
it
from
the
can
if
im
enjoying
it
outside
or
sneaking
it
onto
a
golf
course
i
have
found
my
spring
value
beer
and
im
pretty
happy
about
it
this
is
a
beer
thats
not
going
to
blow
any
serious
ba
away
but
genny
products
are
the
beers
i
grew
up
on
and
im
glad
for
the
chance
to
revisit
it
i
remember
having
this
beer
in
the
early
90s
not
sure
if
it
was
the
same
recipe
although
i
recall
the
brown
colored
can
coming
back
from
retirment
this
beer
is
a
welcome
sight
inexpensive
and
very
tasty
love
the
retro
packaging
its
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
relatively
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
malty
although
a
bit
more
toasted
malt
than
i
recall
crust
on
highlytoasted
bread
the
taste
is
malty
and
flavorful
its
a
little
drier
than
id
like
although
this
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
brew
not
terribly
complex
but
very
enjoyable
nice
beer
for
the
expense
i
loved
this
stuff
ill
definitely
seek
it
out
again
drinkability
going
into
reviewing
this
beer
not
knowing
anything
about
this
beer
and
paying
only
6
29
i
am
really
pleased
with
this
beer
anyway
the
drinkability
is
surprisingly
smooth
but
not
creamy
like
i
like
in
my
bocks
still
if
youre
in
northern
wisconsin
pick
some
up
cheap
now
if
they
would
only
bring
back
12
horse
ale
genesee
bock
really
impressed
me
for
what
it
is
it
is
clean
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
just
like
a
bock
should
be
also
any
bock
in
a
kick
ass
can
that
costs
6
99
a
12
pack
is
good
in
my
book
as
far
as
cheap
beer
goes
this
is
the
best
value
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
maybe
ever
if
you
are
on
a
budget
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
heck
we
are
planning
to
go
back
to
an
all
inclusive
resort
this
year
in
cancun
and
i
wish
the
dosxx
dark
cerveza
obscura
they
serve
was
as
good
as
this
d
the
drinkability
is
ok
since
this
is
my
first
bock
beer
im
not
used
to
the
flavor
and
i
cant
say
its
my
favorite
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
this
lacked
flavor
and
i
would
not
want
to
drink
this
beer
again
when
there
are
better
beers
in
the
same
style
category
overall
a
nice
solid
spring
bock
very
tasty
light
and
crisp
i
will
be
getting
several
12
pks
to
have
for
warmer
weather
a
good
balanced
beer
easy
drinking
i
like
this
one
a
lot
in
the
end
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
offering
i
got
two
12
packs
for
about
13
you
can
bet
i
am
going
to
be
buying
and
drinking
more
of
this
i
have
to
say
i
am
overall
extremely
pleasantly
surprised
beers
at
this
price
for
this
amount
usually
tend
to
signify
halfassed
brewing
but
this
is
a
solid
work
id
like
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
but
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
in
the
store
again
my
pour
produced
a
finger
of
ecru
head
with
low
retention
quickly
becoming
wisps
color
was
a
deep
copperyamber
with
nequality
clarity
and
lots
of
co2
bubbles
gently
rising
to
the
surface
nose
was
really
malty
sweet
accompanied
by
a
light
tang
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
unpleasant
astringency
like
gargling
with
hydrogen
peroxide
in
the
mouth
oof
finish
was
slightly
sweeter
but
i
just
could
not
get
past
that
initial
taste
i
have
a
12pack
so
i
can
revisit
this
one
but
for
now
i
am
sure
i
will
be
one
of
the
low
scores
dnot
the
most
amazing
bock
but
for
8
bucks
a
12
pack
i
think
its
amazing
and
is
definately
a
go
to
due
to
its
solid
taste
and
low
abv
drink
ability
very
high
due
to
the
fact
that
its
not
overly
filling
for
a
darker
brew
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
want
a
more
bold
flavor
yet
require
refreshment
i
have
to
admit
that
im
biased
towards
this
beer
i
know
its
not
the
best
bock
by
a
long
shot
but
at
0
50can
you
cant
beat
the
price
add
in
the
mystic
of
limited
availability
and
great
drinkability
and
you
have
one
of
my
goto
cheap
beers
i
realize
now
that
i
must
take
the
remaining
11
cans
out
of
the
fridge
it
is
how
it
was
years
ago
all
malt
pretty
can
design
though
it
had
this
directly
from
the
can
so
ill
rate
the
appearance
based
on
the
cans
looks
i
really
enjoy
the
design
smelled
of
malts
and
a
touch
of
cooked
corn
who
cares
its
good
old
genesee
its
their
signature
however
i
found
the
taste
to
be
pretty
bland
nothing
offputting
just
really
light
and
bland
i
wish
they
could
up
it
a
touch
oh
well
smooth
and
gennylike
could
do
a
few
no
problem
a
good
beer
to
have
a
casual
burger
cookout
with
love
seeing
the
goat
arriving
on
store
shelves
i
believe
this
beer
is
in
limited
run
so
i
grab
it
when
i
can
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
crisp
and
clean
all
the
way
around
the
body
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
light
for
my
taste
in
all
honesty
this
is
a
good
beer
this
would
see
more
appearances
in
my
home
if
it
wasnt
a
seasonal
d
its
actually
not
bad
a
pretty
good
session
beer
i
dont
like
beers
that
are
too
carbonated
or
too
hoppy
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
d
for
the
price
of
6
a
12
pack
they
should
make
this
year
round
a
good
beer
priced
excellently
i
have
never
had
anything
this
good
that
i
paid
less
for
save
homebrew
they
really
need
to
make
this
year
round
as
i
said
before
this
is
an
entirely
decent
beer
its
not
a
standout
by
any
means
but
especially
given
the
price
its
an
outstanding
value
for
the
rock
bottom
price
its
hard
to
beat
it
ill
gladly
store
a
few
12ers
of
these
in
the
basement
to
serve
as
cheap
session
brews
when
im
just
looking
to
knock
back
a
few
mahogany
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
fruitycitrus
taste
is
light
fruits
with
a
steely
caramel
at
the
end
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
probably
would
go
well
on
those
hot
summer
days
i
should
try
it
again
sometime
in
july
or
august
best
cans
ever
after
tasting
this
genny
product
its
a
shame
this
is
a
limited
release
for
about
50
cents
a
can
this
stuff
is
an
absolute
steal
world
class
beer
not
really
but
its
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
anything
ive
ever
tasted
in
its
price
range
which
means
when
i
need
to
think
about
how
much
ive
got
in
my
wallet
while
shopping
for
beer
this
is
sure
to
come
to
mind
time
and
time
again
its
no
masterpiece
but
at
5
996
99
per
12
pack
its
worth
it
ill
probably
have
an
open
12
in
my
fridge
throughout
its
availability
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
nice
beer
if
you
want
to
break
the
routine
of
macros
but
better
bocks
are
out
there
cheers
rochester
the
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
pilsner
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
crisp
lager
feel
with
just
enough
caramel
sweetness
to
add
some
complexity
its
not
overly
complex
but
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
with
a
balanced
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
bock
like
i
said
its
not
the
most
complex
and
interesting
beer
on
the
market
but
its
smooth
and
easy
drinking

only
about

nothing

d
rating
this

in

of

pre

i
think
that
genny
outdid
themselves
this
is
a
very
plain
and
simple
beer
without
any
fancies
or
nuances
but
it
also
lacks
bullshit
and
it
is
difficult
to
find
anything
wrong
with
it
keeping
in

that
it
came

not
a
bad
beer
at
all
this
beer
surprised
me
a
little
i
knew
it
was
probably
going
to
be
grainy
but
what
got
me
was
that
it
was
a
good
grainy
taste
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
of
these
real
soon
very
drinkable
because
its
incredibly
smooth
just
shocked
by
all
of
the
grapy

this
is
a
tasty
brew
drinkability
not
a
true
bock
in
terms
of
strength
but
it
has
some
bock
character
in
the
taste
not
the
worst
spring
beer
id
have
a
few
more
d
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
i
might
reach
for
it
yearround
if
it
were
available
when
im
looking
for
something
that
i
dont
need
to
think
about
too
much
but
i
still
want
taste
this
would
be
a
perfect
choice
probably
a
step
above
yeungling
lager
on
the
macrolager
taste
scale
not
too
complex
but
still
enough
backbone
for
those
of
us
who
like
to
actually
taste
our
beer
the
cans
alone
make
this
a
worthy
brew
to
try
at
least
once
i
commend
high
falls
for
bringing
it
back
and
hope
it
sells
for
them
final
note
i
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
genesee
as
for
as
long
as
ive
been
able
to
consume
alcoholic
beverages
legally
30
years
genny
has
always
been
there
for
me
im
a
big
fan
of
the
cream
ale
and
now
im
also
a
fan
of
the
goat
p
s
i
love
the
regional
brewers
like
high
falls
matt
lion
and
ic
i
hope
they
are
around
forever
america
is
about
choice
anyone
can
brew
a
great
beer
for
30
a
case
it
takes
skill
to
brew
a
nice
beer
for
12
a
case
for
some
odd
reason
this
beer
is
serving
as
my
reentry
into
reviewing
beer
it
has
been
sometime
8
months
to
be
exact
that
i
have
reviewed
a
beer
i
picked
up
this
beer
a
few
weeks
ago
and
really
enjoyed
the
effort
from
high
falls
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
bubbly
white
head
there
is
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
rather
metallic
the
mouthfeel
is
wet
and
sweet
the
beer
tastes
like
a
beefedup
version
of
yuengling
drinkability
is
good
worth
a
try
for
11
a
case
this
a
nice
mild
springtimesummer
beer
that
is
an
economical
thirst
quencher
i
bought
a
second
12pack
but
probably
wont
buy
another
until
next
year
well
i
am
just
about
done
with
the
12
pack
i
picked
up
a
few
weeks
ago
and
decided
that
i
should
review
one
before
they
are
finished
was
very
happy
to
see
this
brew
i
can
remember
selling
it
when
i
worked
at
a
grand
union
about
17
years
ago
well
anyway
this
brew
poured
to
a
deep
amber
color
with
shat
i
would
call
brown
highlights
the
head
has
a
light
tan
color
quite
small
and
breaks
down
quickly
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
has
caramel
malts
come
through
slight
grain
presence
the
taste
is
fair
with
caramelslight
hop
presence
and
a
slight
metallic
flavors
has
a
slight
dry
finish
to
it
overall
i
would
pick
this
up
a
few
ties
during
the
spring
if
genesee
continues
to
make
it
worth
the
6
49
a
12
pack
not
the
greatest
brew
but
one
that
has
some
character
and
it
is
somewhat
local
i
snagged
this
while
in
new
york
the
retro
packaging
sucked
me
in
it
looks
good
from
the
pour
a
nice
orange
brown
with
a
thick
head
that
lingers
momentarily
much
darker
than
any
macro
beer
ive
ever
had
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
not
too
much
else
besides
a
hint
of
dry
toastiness
the
flavor
is
a
bit
better
with
just
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
and
hints
of
caramel
the
graininess
i
associate
with
most
macros
is
still
there
but
its
muted
a
bit
i
think
that
if
compared
to
craft
beers
of
the
style
this
one
come
up
short
but
if
you
compare
it
to
other
macros
it
is
breath
of
fresh
air
was
happy
to
pick
this
one
up
a
great
alternative
to
the
key
light
monopoly
on
beirut
and
a
fun
beer
to
show
off
to
your
friends
for
a
more
than
reasonable
price
ive
bought
2
12
packs
of
this
so
far
for
myself
and
will
keep
buying
it
as
my
cheap
beer
of
choice
sweet
can
i
love
the
old
school
can
as
well
as
the
6
45
price
tag
for
a
12
pack
this
brew
poured
wonderful
reddish
amber
with
an
off
white
head
the
head
is
frothy
and
leaves
good
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
light
malts
and
straw
adjusted
with
corn
or
rice
also
there
is
just
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
bready
and
pretzel
like
hops
are
almost
a
nonfactor
the
palate
is
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
finish
is
short
and
sweet
overall
not
outstanding
but
a
good
beer
at
a
great
price
d
i
could
definitely
drink
6
or
so
of
these
in
one
sitting
not
bad
the
can
alone
is
easily
worth
half
the
price
of
admission
here
very
similar
to
the
original
from
the
70s
that
i
remember
fondly
this
latest
version
is
a
dark
iced
tea
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
and
decent
lace
it
has
a
sharp
wheat
and
mild
caramel
aroma
this
is
followed
by
a
big
caramel
and
dry
herbal
hop
taste
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
but
i
dont
find
this
to
be
bad
at
all
as
bocks
go
well
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
nice
job
for
a
blue
collar
low
priced
bock
in
a
fun
can
party
on
genee
im
grad
that
i
was
given
a
can
of
this
beer
to
try
because
that
way
i
dont
feel
ripped
off
this
is
definaty
one
local
brew
that
i
can
not
support
it
has
that
typical
genesee
river
smell
and
taste
that
i
expected
im
not
quite
sure
how
they
consider
this
a
bock
beer
d
good
and
i
will
buy
it
again
while
its
available
this
is
a
change
as
ive
come
to
appreciate
the
upped
flavor
right
from
the
can
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
bock
beers
and
only
celebrator
has
really
showed
me
what
a
bock
couldshould
be
worth
a
try
for
the
price
not
really
craft
beer
but
not
macroslop
either
a
bargain
at
6
99
per
12
i
could
pound
half
this
12
pack
in
a
short
amount
of
time
it
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
not
a
masterpiece
but
for
6
99
you
cant
go
wrong
good
tasting
bock
full
flavored
pours
a
dark
amber
with
an
off
white
head
has
a
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
earthy
hops
taste
is
fairly
sweet
and
malty
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
overall
a
nice
traditional
bock
offers
a
clean
finish
while
still
being
satisfying
and
offering
a
good
abv
for
the
style
d
good
sessioner
imho
dive
in
deep
to
this
standard
beer
o
an
easy
drinker
and
maybe
a
good
gateway
for
someone
getting
into
craft
beer
but
not
the
best
bock
available
for
sure
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
to
seek
out
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
had
a
decent
light
brown
color
with
a
short
head
not
too
bad
for
a
spring
beer
decent
flavor
with
decent
body
not
too
much
flavor
goes
down
easy
and
was
very
nice
to
drink
but
nothing
too
spectacular
as
i
was
expecting
more
c
the
first
sip
on
this
one
starts
off
really
sweet
thankfully
that
tones
down
on
further
tastes
still
pretty
malty
sweet
smooth
feel
with
a
mild
carbonation
a
fairly
easytodrink
brew
been
ages
since
ive
had
a
bock
or
at
least
i
cant
recall
the
last
time
i
had
one
this
isnt
all
too
bad
really
mouth
aw
heck
i
cant
finish
this
review
its
not
a
real
traditional
bock
but
its
a
good
interpretation
of
it
to
me
absolutely
delicious
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
texas
day
food
note
this
thing
really
sweetens
and
opens
up
when
i
drink
it
with
food
im
not
big
on
pairing
food
with
beer
but
this
particular
brew
and
a
happy
accident
showed
me
how
sometimes
a
proper
food
pairing
can
help
bring
out
the
good
flavor
notes
in
the
beer
anything
salty
seems
to
help
this
beers
taste
just
a
great
beer
and
one
i
look
forward
to
every
spring
when
it
is
released
overall
i
really
like
this
spring
bock
because
it
is
such
a
complex
flavored
beer
with
a
rather
high
alcohol
content
in
which
the
alcohol
does
not
dominate
the
boys
and
gals
at
saint
arnolds
have
a
great
beer
here
and
i
tip
my
virtual
hat
to
them
o
a
very
sessionable
beer
robust
but
not
overpowering
bless
you
st
arnold
atmosphere
is
decent
nice
hue
medium
carbonation
not
much
head
or
lacing
nose
is
malty
with
some
sweet
notes
syrupy
woody
malt
character
with
a
cloying
synthetic
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
getting
more
of
the
flavor
of
the
sweet
malt
kinda
like
it
very
easy
drinking
even
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
backend
but
mainly
a
decent
malty
bock
almost
like
a
doppelbock
light
so
much
better
and
certainly
more
boozy
than
its
in
state
rival
shiner
for
nearly
the
same
price
overall
to
me
its
meh
weird
like
it
cant
figure
out
what
style
it
is
not
too
crazy
about
it
this
will
probably
be
my
only
one
other
reviews
have
accurately
noted
this
beers
characteristics
so
i
will
not
bother
you
again
with
that
i
like
the
beer
fine
but
having
had
many
german
bocks
and
remembering
back
to
when
i
used
to
drink
shiner
bock
when
it
was
a
true
bock
i
find
this
one
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
the
style
sure
it
fits
the
american
taste
too
many
hops
but
again
not
truly
representative
of
the
style
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
see
myself
having
one
of
these
after
mowing
the
lawn
first
off

to
uhcougar12

head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
bready
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
roasted
barley
malt
definitely
comes
through
in
the
taste
but
the
flavors
are
certainly
a
bit
odd
there
is
light
carbonation
and
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
there
is
a
lingering
aftertaste
this
is
an
interesting
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
bock
i
would
recommend
it
rjt
a
good
spring
bock
a
bit
more
head
retention
would
be
nice
good
malt
character
and
fairly
wellbalanced
with
the
bittering
not
a
stunner
but
certainly
enjoyable
food
pairing
chicken
especially
spicy
chicken
wings
pours
a
muddy
light
brown
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
limited
spotty
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
before
falling
into
a
thin
collar
the
nose
is
fairly
plain
with
some
bready
malt
and
a
touch
of
caramel
bread
crust
there
too
the
flavor
brings
some
malt
sweetness
and
lightlytoasted
bread
slightly
doughy
with
some
caramel
and
light
toffee
perhaps
a
bit
nutty
light
bitterness
in
the
midpalate
and
in
the
finish
actually
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
as
it
cuts
through
the
sweet
caramel
that
makes
the
flavor
so
enjoyable
the
feel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
solid
take
on
the
style
d
a
slightly
aboveaverage
bock
probably
the
definition
if
b
beer
enjoyable
in
the
moment
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
carbonation
zest
would
keep
me
from
having
multiple
bottlespints
overall
im
just
discovering
the
whole
bock
concept
i
just
dont
like
most
lagers
but
this
is
good
i
dont
know
that
id
seek
it
out
but
its
tasty
and
i
could
put
a
bunch
of
these
away
no
problem
the
beer
was
a
dark
copper
orange
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
it
smells
of
mostly
sweet
caramel
with
a
hint
of
apple
and
lemon
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
followed
by
loads
of
sweet
malt
with
nutty
flavors
alcohol
lemon
and
a
bready
finish
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
sticky
this
is
a
little
too
malty
for
my
taste
decent
beer
very
abundant
locally
in
austin
but
wouldnt
be
my
first
goto
for
a
midlighter
style
overall
a
good
bock
and
a
perfect
brew
for
spring
this
is
another
winner
from
st
arnold
and
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
drinking
again
and
again
this
bock
would
also
stand
up
very
well
to
its
german
counterparts
certain
larger
companies
that
make
bock
could
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
this
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
i
get
a
ton
of
malt
mainly
toffee
and
some
bready
malts
just
what
i
expect
in
a
bock
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
there
is
a
nice
caramel
and
toffee
backbone
to
the
flavor
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
there
is
some
slight
hop
flavor
but
the
beer
is
pretty
sweet
overall
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
bock
the
beer
had
a
good
bock
color
the
nice
was
nice
but
not
over
bearing
i
smelt
malts
originally
the
taste
was
the
same
lots
of
sweet
malts
and
very
easy
on
the
pallate
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
one
of
the
best
bocks
that
ive
ever
had
really
really
good
beer
pours
clear
light
brown
in
color
with
a
soda
like
offwhite
head
doesnt
last
more
than
a
minute
no
lacing
at
all
the
nose
is
somewhat
toasty
with
minimal
hop
presence
seems
to
have
lots
of
earth
tones
smells
good
but
not
very
aromatic
you
have
to
dig
for
it
taste
is
of
toasted
grains
and
bread
like
it
has
some
bitter
hops
flavor
as
well
nothing
to
special
close
to
light
bodied
and
high
carbonation
which
makes
it
a
little
refreshing
for
a
bock
seeing
is
that
the
flavors
are
mellow
drinkability
is
high
in
the
sense
that
nothing
is
over
powering
although
abv
would
bring
it
down
an
average
beer
at
best
a
little
better
than
shiner
bock
d
very
drinkable
really
great
offering
from
st
arnold
pretty
good
for
a
bock
beer
its
rich
and
flavorable
first
off
once
again
im
biased
about
these
guys
i
like
em
and
what
they
are
doing
in
texas
had
this
at
a
bbq
and
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
amlost
too
easy
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
damination
of
the
caramely
malty
notes
kind
of
overpowered
the
beer
good
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
ones
from
these
guys
d
its
actually
quite
good
it
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
the
initial
flavor
is
sweet
but
there
is
just
enough
hop
to
reel
in
the
sweetness
d
not
a
bad
little
bock
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
though
not
all
that
balanced
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
if
it
werent
a
seasonal
would
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
recommended
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
has
a
freshly
kilned
barley
aroma
taste
is
very
malt
oriented
as
a
bock
should
be
a
hint
of
hops
only
to
balance
the
powerful
sweetness
a
hint
of
alcohol
is
detectable
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
carbonation
i
would
drink
this
again
a
good
example
of
a
style
that
you
dont
see
too
often
the
mouth
could
use
a
bit
more
heft
but
it
works
as
a
lighter
version
the
sweetness
limited
me
to
one
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
one
overall
a
good
beginner
bock
certainly
drinkable
but
not
very
complex
reddish
brown

into
a

waft
by
intermittently
taste
is
all
malt
and
a
clean
finish
not
a
terribly
complex
beer
but
i
like
its
good
malt
flavor
and
drinkability
spring
bock
is
an
interesting
beer
theres
some
good
flavors
inside
and
its
relatively
easydrinking
but
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
my
favorite
for
a
bock
all
in
all
though
its
a
nice
spring
seasonal
thats
off
the
beaten
path
of
typical
styles
md
light
to
mediumbodied
with
medium
carbonation
it
is
overall
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
it
is
a
good
toasted
flavor
pale
pilsner
malts
starting
things
off
in
the
flavor
departmentsome
caramel
notes
pull
through
as
it
warms
grassy
hops
lend
a
healthy
dose
of
bitterness
to
balance
the
malt
mineralwater
crispness
with
a
trace
of
musty
sour
sulfur
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
where
st
arnolds
spring
bock
shines
as
its
mediumlight
body
is
both
crisp
and
creamily
smooth
at
the
same
time
lingering
bitter
note
from
the
hops
is
mild
enough
to
allow
the
malt
to
sweeten
up
the
back
of
the
palate
wow
what
an
underrated
beer
wish
i
wouldve
known
sooner
definitely
a
repeat
for
me
this
spring
next
stop
sixpack
on
tap
at
petrol
station
clear
bright
copper

12

of
foam
with
a
half
life
of
about
20
seconds
the
aroma
is
maltysweet
and
a
little
toasted
very
much
bocky
the
taste
is
what
i
would
call
strong
lager
sweet
clean
and
malty
absolutely
appropriate
for
the
style
while
not
being
anything
too
out
of
the
ordinary
the
bodyis
mediumplus
again
giving
appropriate
bock
presence
very
good
for
the
style
should
be
rated
higher
in
my
opinion
d
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
i
wish
that
this
beer
wasnt
seasonal
this
is
a
fine
bock
just
what
i
expected
for
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
d
this
isnt
an
increadible
beer
its
not
all
that
complex
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
works
well
for
what
it
is
i
will
certainly
try
this
again
when
it
comes
out
in
the
spring
could
be
a
nice
memory
former
for
what
spring
in
texas
is
like
d
a
good
bock
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
could
and
do
revisit
from
time
to
time
very
clean
finish
nice
carbonation
and
very
smooth
a
great
bock
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
a
pleasant
bock
overall
overall
impression
a
nice
spring
offering
good
bock
flavors
and
plenty
drinkable
d
good
brew
celebrate
spring
not
too
many
southern
american
bocks
out
there
to
compare
to
its
an
underrepresented
style
in
the
region
the
flavor
profile
is
sweet
caramely
malts
playing
off
of
toasty
malts
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
nose
a
mild
alcohol
bite
ensues
in
midpalate
and
the
finish
is
decently
clean
for
a
bock
its
ok
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
toasty
for
me
probably
my
least
favorite
seasonal
from
sa
pours
a
nice
clearclean
golden
brown
color
nice

nice
little
creamy
tannish

with
some
spices
and

the

this
is
a
tasty
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
like
i
said
this
is
the
best
bock
ive
had
as
to
date
a
nice
beer
for
early
spring
in
texas
maltier
than
my
usual
brews
but
refreshing
i
enjoyed
the
bitter
kick
at
the
end
but
it
might
offend
bock
purists
one
of
my
favorite
st
arnold
beers
not
bad
drinkability
an
interesting
bock
a
decent

overall

clean
taste

some
malt
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
not
too
much
flavor
but
clean
almost
like
a
lawnmower
beer
drinkability
reasonably
decent
on
the
drinkability
though
the
sweetness
would
keep
me
from
simply
pounding
them
down
but
yeah
its
a
good
bock
overall
from
a
12oz
bottle
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orangered
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
spices
alcohol
malt
and
honey
first
taste
sweet
and
floral
and
even
with
tons
of

this
beer
falls
off
as
it
is
devoid
of
much
other
flavor
not
impressed
d
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
bocks
i
have
had
great
for
early

at
one
and

has
sweet
ripe
grape
skins
matched
with
soft
but
zesty
phelonic
spicey
tones
as
you
take
first
sip
you
get
creamy
carmalized
sweetness
and

feel
the
spice
feel
is
consistant
and
very
dry
throughout
the
palate
leaves
kind

a
bitter

maybe
go
well

if
the

were
more
pleasing
the
mouthfeel

help
with
the

overall
not
a

beer
im
not
a
big
bock
fan
to
begin
with
but
i
couldnt
penalize
it
because
of
my
personal
tastes
too
me
it
was
just
a
bit
too
sweet
and
not
balanced
well
between
the
hops
and
malts
d
very
nice
drinking
bock
from
texaas
something
about
saint
arnolds
bottles
and
labels
appeals
to
me
just
thought
id
throw
that
out
there
spring
bock
is
a
solid
theres
that
word
again
version
that
is
close
to
being
good
if
you
love
the
style
bump
the
taste
score
to
the
next
highest
number
thanks
mhewes
under
the
cap
hop
drop
roll
d
good
beer
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
there
is
a
definite
alcohol
bite
to
this
though
it
does
have
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
dry
in
the
mouth
for
me
but
all
in
all
a
very
nice
version
of
a
bock
i
could
drink
this
frequently
l
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
too
high
in
abv
for
the
style
making
it
not
as
drinkable
as
others
this
is
pushing
into
dopplebock
territory
really
what
can
i
say
i
just
didnt
like
this
one
like
i
said
the
mouthfeel
should
be
thicker
and
smoother
some
moderate
crispness
and
a
nice
lingering
apple
like
sweetness
on
the
finish
are
nice
though
which
do
increase
drinkability
to
me
d
a
beer
that
you
will
know
how
many
you
drank
doesnt
really
go
down
quickly
but
it
is
something
that
can
be
enjoyed
one
will
hit
the
spot
but
another
is
unnecessary
that
said
this
is
a
well
done
bock
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
my
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
that
its
rather
lackluster
although
its
difficult
to
pinpoint
exactly
what
is
making
me
feel
that
way
i
really
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
beer
again
unless
my
options
were
limited
drinkability
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
should
quench
better
an
all
around
solid
brew
poured
into
my
pilsner
glass
a
nice
crystal
clear
copper
color
very
light
tan
head
that
settles
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
very
malty
sweet
almost
molasses
like
taste
is
somewhat
bready
with
hints
of
caramel
or
butterscotch
a
slight
bit
of
syrupy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
i
expected
but
not
too
bad
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
spring
afternoon
beer
nice
and
sweet
clean
crisp
a
good
style
spring
bock
is
a
damn
fine
beer
i
had
somewhat
high
expectations
given
st
arnolds
lofty
reputation
and
this
certainly
met
the
bill
the
nose
could
certainly
stand
a
little
fine
tuning
but
its
still
a
fine
beer
despite
that
small
flaw
certainly
recommended
notes
very
enjoyable
stuff
one
of
the
better
americanmade
bocks
ive
tried
good
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
spring
with
its
warm
days
and
cold
nights
d
this
is
my
first
st
arnolds
brew
and
i
actually
think
its
quite
drinkable
id
definitely
be
interested
in
trying
a
few
more
from
this
brewery
verdict
spring
bock
is
a
wellbalanced
dark
lager
with
rich
malt
and
crisp
citrus
hiding
aboveaverage
potency
with
this
beer
saint
arnold
is
really
forcing
me
to
rethink
my
standards
for
a
good
bock
and
i
love
them
for
it
12oz
bottle
courtesy
of
mhewes
this
is
my
second
st
arnolds
brew
dark
reddish
color
with
a
good
sized
head
the
smell
was
kinda
beery
and
average
i
know
that
doesnt
make
sense
so
ill
say
it
smelled
lagerish
the
flavor
was
nice
and
clean
with
a
hint
of
fruitiness
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
easy
to
drink
but
i
am
just
not
able
to
appreciate
lagers
fully
yet
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
solid
offering
from
them
i
would
have
no
issues
with
drinking
this
one
down
regular
very
nice
offering
smells
like
tasty
caramel
malt
the
taste
fits
the
smell
with
tasty
caramel
toffee
and
a
hint
of
hops
rounding
it
out
theres
an
acidic
tang
from
either
hops
or
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
im
not
sure
just
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
served

my
leute

no
freshness
dating

hazy

inch
loose

disappeared
within
about
30
seconds

but
poor
adherence
nose
is
a
little
boozey
and
sweet
as
well
as
the
presence
of
dark

flavor
was
definitely
more
fullbodied
than
the
nose

malty
bready
caramel
and
dark
fruit
flavors
finish
was
a
bit
tangy
some
effervescence
in
the
mouth
creates
a
light
burn
drinkability
is
limited
it
was
definitely
worth
a
try
and
had
an
interesting
taste
but
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
this
is
heavy
as
expected
but
doesnt
necessarily
pack
as
much
flavor
punch
as
wed
like
good
effort
nonetheless
id
be
willing
to
partner
up
with
this
saint
for
a
session
considering
how
quickly
its
going
perhaps
its
good
i
only
have
one
nice
bock
drinks
pretty
easy
a
solid
bock
smooth
and
clean
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
nice
example
of
the
bock
style
thanks
to
jonathanl7890
for
this
one
d
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
have
while
sitting
on
the
back
pourch
in
the
texas
spring
worth
trying
sometime
got
this
one
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
came
out
in
a
pint
glasspoured
an
amber
color
with
a
2
finger
beige
head
the
smell
was
malty
with
a
hint
of
bread
crust
the
taste
was
malt
bread
and
just
a
hint
of
honey
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
not
as
light
a
bit
bitter
in
the
end
but
overall
this
beer
was
very
very
enjoyable
i
hope
to
find
this
for
some
home
consumption
a
great
seasonal
bock
to
enjoy
medium
amber
with
a
very
faint
haze
and
a
thin
cap
of
fine
beige
bubbles
decent
head
retention
with
a
little
lacing
malty
aroma
bread
crust
a
little
buttery
toasty
with
mild
fruit
character
restrained
balanced
bitterness
just
a
little
fruit
malt
dominates
the
flavour
profile
notes
of
sweet
toasty
malt
bread
and
honey
bitterness
comes
forward
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
fluffy
texture
pretty
good
stuff
quite
a
drinkable
bock
muddy
orange
brown
pour
with
a
medium
yellowish
tan
head
smell
is
slightly
sour
sweet
and
strange
and
may
be
coming
from
the
yeast
or
perhaps
its
from
being
a
bit
old
almost
a
teriyaki
or
soy
smellflavor
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
oddly
sweet
and
not
particularly
pleasant
didnt
taste
like
the
2
other
heller
bocks
ive
had
unusual
and
sort
of
hard
to
describe
but
i
wasnt
impressed
and
didnt
finish
it
need
to
rerate
with
a
fresher
bottle
probably
enjoyed
it
d
good
brew
for
the
hop
head
that
wants
to
try
a
bock
will
definately
have
at
my
first
bbq
of
the
year
d
a
very
nice
texas
bock
with
a
hint
more
hops
that
the
brew
from
shiner
texas
this
would
be
perfect
watching
the
barbecue
on
a
spring
day
a
decent
offering
by
saint
arnolds
i
recommend
trying
this
spring
seasonal
if
you
ever
visit
the
houston
area
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
each
spring
pours
a
nice
amber
color
and
has
a
nice
creamy
head
laces
moderatly
down
the
glass
has
kind
of
a
carmal
taste
not
to
bad
juat
a
little
different
but
as
with
all
saint
arnolds
products
it
was
good
this
is
a
beer
i
will
probably
buy
again
this
is
a
good
beer
to
show
up
at
a
party
with
drinkability
not
a
bad
bock
but
it
does
have
a
few
disconcerting
flaws
an
enjoyable
beer
and
one
of
the
better
bocks
ive
had
st
arnild
offers
many
seasonals
and
this
is
one
of
the
brewerys
good
but
not
necessarily
great
seasnal
products
still
it
is
worth
the
occasional
sample
and
it
does
have
enough
positive
qualities
to
recommend
this
is
a
very
good
bock
a
very
good
beer
for
the
style
a
whole
lot
more
authentic
than
shiner
bock
as
again
this
tastes
like
a
real
german
bock
at
first
i
thought
it
was
a
tad
sweet
but
the
hops
balance
this
brew
out
very
well
very
good
for
a
nice
spring
evening
not
the
best
bock
but
kudos
to
the
effort
i
dont
see
many
around
here
i
would
definitely
go
for
another
next
time
i
have
bockish
cravings
a
solid
bock
much
better
than
the
one
shiner
makes
its
a
beer
worth
trying
escpecially
if
you
are
a
bock
fan
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
bottled
on
notch
dec
06
on
the
front
label
had
a
very
small
head
that
quickly
disappeared
the
color
was
a
clear
ambercopper
with
good
carbonation
the
aroma
was
very
bready
with
bunch
of
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
standard
the
taste
was
malty
with
a
good
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
it
warms
you
up
as
you
drink
which
surprised
me
since
only
6
4
its
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
for
me
not
great
but
not
bad
dont
see
a
place
for
this
in
my
regular
rotation
but
worth
having
a
single
or
two
each
year
3
5
rb
t
o
looks
golden
with
a
little
red
in
it
smells
of
lots
of
flavor
light
but
complex
almost
citrusy
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
tastes
sweet
and
heavy
what
i
smelled
came
back
for
more
heavier
on
the
tongue
than
i
would
have
expected
given
the
color
but
right
for
a
bock
carbonated
just
right
i
probably
couldnt
drink
as
much
of
this
in
one
sitting
as
i
want
our
texas
spring
is
like
everyone
elses
deep
summer
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
lot
better
in
a
cooler
evening
after
some
hard
labor
in
the
sun
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
scant
14
beige
head
over
the
clear
copper
brew
head
fades
down
to
a
film
of
small
bubbles
pretty
quick
but
with
ample
lacing
aroma
is
a
bag
of
grain
with
plenty
of
fruitiness
taste
is
great
maltiness
the
tinges
of
fruit
in
the
middle
with
a
slightly
gritty
close
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
mmm
bock
a
nice
american
bock
not
something
id
seek
out
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
a
fresh
spring
bock
nice
pours
out
to
a
medium
auburn
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
of
foam
medium
low
level
of
carbonation
with
some
hints
of
lace
aromas
of
fresh
malts
with
a
very
pronounced
vegetal
character
taste
is
medium
bodied
and
very
malty
dense
roasted
malt
grain
spiced
herbs
a
touch
of
caramel
mouthfeel
is
again
medium
bodied
with
some
density
noted
on
the
palate
north
of
average
drinkability
special
thanks
to
assurbanipaul
for
the
sample
a
decent
bock
beer
and
quite
easy
to
drink
st
arnold
wins
again
i
drank
this
at
in
the
box
outside
my
door
temp
50f
into
my
troegenator
mug
i
gave
it
a
stiff
pour
which
produced
a
heady
beer
with
a
nice
amber
shine
body
smells
like
a
very
light
cream
caramel
with
a
touch
of
citrus
spice
beautiful
taste
very
delicate
but
sure
sticky
malt
but
thin
enough
with
just
enough
alcohol
to
make
sure
it
is
not
cloy
great
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
cheers2beers
opinion
well
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
it
is
severely
lacking
to
be
considered
a
bock
there
needs
to
be
a
bunch
more
toastiness
along
with
some
melanoidin
presence
this
beer
is
closer
to
an
oktoberfest
as
it
is
a
bock
in
my
opinion
it
still
lacks
the
malt
presence
for
an
ofest
also
but
that
style
is
closer
this
is
a
clean
and
wellcrafted
beer
but
closer
to
the
dark
lager
category
than
it
is
in
the
bock
category
oh
well
maybe
next
year
it
will
shape
up
we
have
had
better
years
of
this
style
this
is
a
really
good
beer
by
a
really
good
label
st
arnold
out
of
houston
it
has
a
really
nice
color
mainly
redish
amber
it
has
a
little
head
on
it
not
much
but
ok
the
flavor
is
very
complex
and
it
has
hints
of
strawberry
or
raspberry
or
some
fruity
flavor
to
it
which
im
not
used
to
its
an
entirely
different
beer
so
get
ready
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
in
the
world
but
really
good
overall
d
the
drinkability
is
above
average
presentation
packaged
in
a
short
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
a
texas
bock
pours
with
a
frothy
amber
colored
head
that
sits
atop
a
orangeamber
colored
beer
the
aroma
has
notes
of
caramel
and
a
sweet
concentrated
fruity
maltiness
that
i
associate
with
strong
lagers
and
notes
of
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
rich
malty
finish
that
almost
has
a
meatiness
to
it
i
get
notes
of
bergamot
in
this
beer
though
it
seems
to
be
a
mix
of
the
maltiness
and
perhaps
the
subtle
hopping
this
beer
has
a
medium
full
body
to
it
that
coats
the
mouth
with
sweet
malt
notes
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
bitterness
as
well
as
an
astringency
that
is
a
mix
of
toasted
malts
and
a
tannic
like
drying
definitely
interesting
and
tasty
though
it
could
use
a
bit
more
oomph
notes
again
great
summer
beer
and
a
very
nice
alternative
to
the
macros
that
are
often
consumed
in
the
sweltering
texas
summer
heat
eventhough
its
a
spring
bock
raised
in
south
texas
he
works
hard
and
plays
hard
he
wanted
little
of
this
bock
at
least
its
better
than
shiner
bock
mouthfeel
is
not
too
heavy
very
clean
easily
sessionable
not
anywhere
near
the
salvator
class
of
doppels
but
not
bad
for
a
local
craft
attempt
at
a
bock
dare
i
say
it
but
i
much
prefer
this
to
a
shiner
its
intended
competition
and
market
in
this
area
of
the
country
this
beer
reminds
me
a
lot
of
abita
amber
which
i
most
recently
consumed
about
a
week
ago
spring
bocks
appearance
is
caramel
amber
in
color
with
the
usual
slight
head
featured
in
saint
arnold
beers
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
bready
malts
and
a
touch
of
grain
taste
is
malty
sweet
almost
a
little
sugary
mainly
of
caramel
malts
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
but
not
quite
rich
or
complex
enough
comments
my
poor
luck
with
saint
arnolds
continues
goes
fairly
well
with
cajun
spicy
pork
and
garlic
roasted
tomoatoes
with
spicy
carrots
on
the
side
exceptionally
drinkable
the
first
one
was
down
before
i
even
realized
it
ill
buy
this
one
again
for
sure
saint
arnolds
produces
a
good
lineup
of
brews
and
the
spring
bock
is
a
great
reflection
of
their
ability
to
craft
quality
beers
at
affordable
price
points
good
show
the
copper
color
is
good
for
its
style
the
head
is
lacking
as
it
pours
it
appears
to
be
low
on
carbonation
even
less
than
its
style
the
smell
brightens
the
senses
and
wants
to
make
up
for
the
lackluster
carbonation
the
first
taste
is
a
very
good
malty
sweetness
as
it
swishes
in
the
mouth
one
gets
the
hint
of
hops
after
a
couple
of
minutes
the
taste
becomes
dominated
by
caramel
as
it
warms
even
more
caramel
and
almost
a
buttery
taste
takes
over
this
makes
the
drinkability
rather
disappointing
considering
the
decline
in
taste
is
quite
rapid
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
is
nothing
memorable
it
is
sweet
thin
and
not
very
balanced
i
want
a
truly
good
amercian
bock
pours
a
carmelred
color
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
carmely
and
malty
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
taste
is
supersweet
with
brown
sugar
and
carmel
flavors
slight
roasted
quality
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
are
also
present
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
perfect
carbonation
that
seems
to
sit
in
the
background
drinkability
is
good
i
could
down
quite
a
few
of
these
a
very
good
beer
from
a
brewer
that
i
have
never
heard
of
until
a
week
ago
but
i
now
respect
each
of
their
offerings
thanks
aain
assurbanipaul
for
the
texas
sized
trade
even
though
i
hate
the
texassized
cliche
sampled
from
bottle
pours
a
crystal
clear
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
scattered
offwhite
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
mild
roasted
malts
and
is
for
the
lack
of
a
better
word
clean
flavor
is
somewhat
bitter
for
a
bock
yeah
and
the
roastedtoasty
flavors
of
the
caramelized
european
malts
are
truly
special
because
the
flavors
are
layered
and
not
onedimensional
a
complex
malt
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
a
spicy
hop
flavor
addition
medium
to
fullbodied
and
smooth
as
glass
a
hint
of
alcohol
presence
takes
a
bit
away
from
the
mouthfeel
but
this
is
easy
drinking
if
you
are
in
texas
home
to
both
shiner
bock
and
st
arnolds
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
the
st
arnolds
bock
over
the
shiner
youll
be
glad
you
did
i
havent
sampled
too
many
bocks
so
i
dont
have
a
lot
to
go
on
as
far
as
comparisions
however
if
all
spring
bocks
are
like
this
one
ill
be
drinking
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
of
them
this
is
truly
a
nice
beer
thanks
again
to
hardtarget
beautiful
deep
amber
color
dark
tan
head
that
dies
quickly
to
a
lasting
lace
slightly
metallic
smell
and
then
it
tastes
it
tastes
well
big
and
malty
fruity
but
hmm
what
fruit
not
a
zesty
citrus
something
more
reserved
sip
a
nice
ripe
red
delicious
apple
a
wee
bit
earthy
lingering
malty
taste
and
feel
ah
a
touch
of
the
butterscotchy
diacetyl
perhaps
a
fine
beer
pour
me
another
barkeep
the
small
noisy
yellowishtan
head
dies
fast
leaves
no
lacing
the
beer
is
clear
and
dark
redamber
almost
amberred
peanuts
in
the
nose
and
some
fruit
taste
is
fruity
dark
nutty
then
thick
buttery
very
dark
malty
then
strongly
buttery
bitter
alcoholic
grapes
burps
its
pretty
good
flavorful
its
not
sweet
at
all
almost
sour
in
its
lack
of
sweetness
plenty
of
nice
flavors
though
overall
impression
while
others
have
stated
that
this
isnt
their
best
brew
i
think
that
says
more
for
the
quality
of
their
other
offerings
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
and
drinkable
its
heavy
enough
for
one
to
scratch
my
beer
itch
but
ill
be
bock
for
more
sorry
recommended
seems
a
little
thin
for
a
true
bock
yet
it
had
a
great
balance
of
malt
hop
taste
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
too
i
put
down
a
pint
in
about
less
than
a
minute
ill
probably
buy
a
sixer
every
spring
pours
a
bright
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
trace
amount
of

nose
is
lightly
toasted
sweet
malts
light
caramel
and
wet
wood
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
nice
crispness
taste
is
a
bit
fruity
with
some
sweet
caramel
notes
that
are
nicely
balanced
by
some
bitter
hops
this
is
a
decent
and
refreshing
brew
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
saint
arnold
brewing
mildy
sweet
with
a
taste
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
a
great
seasonal
offering
perfect
for
a
cold
december
evening
overall
an
inoffensive
lager
that
is
a
good
change
of
pace
from
some
of
the
heavy
hitters
that
craft
has
to
offer
very
smooth
winter
beer
better
on
draft
little
hint
of
a
citrus
taste
your
lady
will
love
this
beer
while
sitting
by
a
roaring
fire
had
this
out
of
a
bottle
a
few
days
ago
its
a
bit
bitter
but
balanced
by
nice
malt
sweetness
and
a
fair
bit
of
spice
cinammon
maybe
and
it
tastes
absolutely
fantastic
pairs
well
with
seafood
for
what
its
worth
deep
caramel
brown
beer
bottle
color
with
mild
spiced
malt
smell
the
taste
is
a
mild
malty
sweetness
some
ginger
and
other
spices
a
good
winter
beer
with
a
lightmed
body
and
very
drinkable
you
can
definitely
taste
the
spices
which
were
pleasant
but
overall
the
flavors
are
a
little
too
strong
in
my
opinion
this
is
definitely
a
bold
brew
not
my
favorite
holiday
beer
but
its
alright
it
had
a
nice
bock
beer
taste
aesop
rock
show

this

good
balance
between

sweet

very
drinkable
smooth
and

with
a

overall
this
beer
looked
better
than
it
tasted
it
was
good
but
not
great
i
would
probably
not
seek
this
one
out
again
as
there
are
better
options
available
sam
adams
makes
a
lot
of
beers
but
many
are
underwhelming
malty
with
spice
one
of
my
favorites
overall
winter
lager
is
a
beautiful
beer
that
sports
a
strong
malt
backbone
that
is
well
complimented
by
a
cinnamonlike
spiciness
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasteful
i
recommend
scent
of
caramel
with
a
little
hay
clean
crisp
with
decent
amount
of
carbonation
not
as
heavy
or
filling
as
a
double
bock
but
still
some
of
the
same
rich
taste
with
the
malt
dominating
this
is
good
stuff
its
got
a
reddish
hue
to
it
with
a
head
on
top
that
you
have
to
respect
its
a
strong
lager
taste
but
with
a
cinnamonginger
spice
with
it
making
it
a
pleasantly
interesting
taste
nice
light
smooth
lager
just
perfect
for
the
winter
months
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
with
taste
that
does
not
fill
you
too
much
sweet
smooth
and
delicious
if
your
lady
likes
beer
this
would
be
good
for
her
pours
a
light
hazel
color
with
an
eggshell
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
has
bits
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
with
some
spice
like
nutmeg
and
clove
coming
through
as
well
the
taste
was
a
bit
heavy
with
the
spice
and
heavy
characters
from
the
malt
coming
through
a
mainstay
for
the
season
and
a
very
decent
one
at
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
goes
down
smooth
but
unfortunately
doesnt
taste
that
good
not
awful
just
not
good
pretty
good
beer
has
a
nice
spiciness
that
is
refreshing
in
the
cold
months
red
cooper
color
with
a
thing
head
and
lace
at
ginger
and
cinnamon
spice
wheat
and
crystal
malt
earthy
bitterness
thin
with
low
carbonation
it
is
decent
and
i
like
drinking
it
in
the
samuel
adams
variety
packs
one
of
my
top
five
favorites
love
this
beer
i
really
appreciate
the
taste
aroma
and
drinkability
of
this
brew
great
balance
overall
a
typical
sam
adams
brew
good
seasonal
lager
but
seems
a
little
light
compared
to
a
good
winter
ale
great
winter
beer
delicious
bock
good
seasonal
beer
wish
it
was
around
longer
nice
amber
colour
superb
taste
on
draft
in
a
frosted
mug
ugh
clean
and
crisp
spices
are
subtle
and
well
balanced
a
good
easy
drinking
winter
beer
looks
great
smells
so
so
very
average
tasting
beer
just
ok
below
average
i
think
purchased
the
variety
pack
and
poured
into
a
harpoon
pint
glass
ok
the
carbonation
is
light
but
makes
it
enjoyable
the
nose
was
average
and
nothing
special
the
taste
pretty
much
followed
suit
but
added
a
little
extra
with
some
nice
spiciness
this
was
not
overpowering
it
was
just
enough
to
keep
it
lively
nothing
to
really
hold
my
attention
or
make
me
yearn
for
another
one
overall
it
is
a
sam
adams
and
usually
they
are
all
just
average
drinkable
beers
i
hate
to
say
that
because
i
have
just
moved
from
vermont
and
love
the
new
england
area
beers
but
sam
adams
just
seems
to
produce
more
average
brews
than
strong
ones
and
this
beer
winter
lager
just
happens
to
be
one
of
the
average
ones
overall
classic
holiday
spiced
lager
very
drinkable
great
color
and
a
nice
change
to
the
usual
ales
i
consume
edit
i
actually
had
a
holiday
party
and
found
that
i
ended
up
drinking
a
lot
of
these
myself
i
kept
coming
back
to
it
for
the
smooth
easy
drinkabiiity
and
pleasant
flavors
ive
revised
the
score
up
a
little
to
reflect
the
fact
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
have
developed
an
appreciation
for
for
this
subtle
spiced
lager
perhaps
i
will
seek
it
out
again
after
all
best
winter
lager
in
my
opinion
in
fact
my
favorite
winter
beer
and
something
i
just
need
to
have
during
the
christmas
time
dark
copper
color
very
fruity
almost
lemon
smell
and
something
resembling
hefe
wheat
beers
average
carbonaton
light
foam
taste
is
very
fruity
with
mild
hops
very
aleish
in
fact
and
not
lager
bit
sweet
a
hint
of
hefe
here
too
just
terrific
product
in
my
opinion
meh

solid
seasonal
offering
by
sam
adams
look
is
nice
an
amber
brown
with
clarity
smells
lagery
with
a
hint
of
wheat
taste
is
like
an
amber
ale
with
a
little
hint
if
winter
flavor
you
get
a
tad
of
the
wheat
on
the
tongue
feels
like
a
good
refreshing
lager
that
isnt
watered
down
overall
i
prefer
some
of
sams
other
offerings
but
this
is
good
surprisingly
dark
red
smells
of
pleasant
christmas
spices
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
smooth
drinking
yum
good
stuff
canr
wait
until
next
winter
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
overall
it
pours
nicely
and
behaves
like
i
would
expect
a
sam
adams
beer
to
behave
the
head
hangs
around
the
carbonation
is
steady
and
it
smells
of
biscuity
caramel
malt
there
are
hints
of
nutmeg
and
orange
that
wrap
around
the
caramel
and
cola
to
produce
a
very
pleasant
combination
copper
brown
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
a
fingernail
of
beige
colored
foam
covers
the
majority
of
the
top
light
aromas
of
caramel
and
dark
malt
are
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is

the

maybe
a

is
not
overwhelming
with

very

taste
is
very
much
like
the

bread
some
orange
and

however
flavor
is
subtle
as
well
winterbeers
an
acceptable
winter
bock
with
a
steep

o
a
very
mediocre
beer
some
good
notes
but
i
will
not
be
having
it
again
o
not
a
bad
winter
beer
but
didnt
wow
me
i
am
enjoying
it
and
wouldnt
pass
it
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
would
buy
it
at
a
store
o
the
harshness
at
the
finish
is
a
turn
off

eight
not
just
four
bottles
of
this
one
and
glad
they
packed
it
that
way
solid
beer
pretty
enjoyable
for
the
season
i
could
drink
a
few
more
this
season
overall
this
is
a
good
winter
beer
good
balance
between
malt
and
sweet
and
hops
very
drinkable
o
pretty
solid
i
dont
remember
liking
this
as
much
before
id
like
it
to
be
a
tad
stronger
for
the
style
though
overall
a
good
beer
sam
adams
seasonal
are
pretty
decent
and
this
one
is
about
average
as
far
as
they
go
the
summer
ale
is
probably
my
favorite
o
samuel
adams
is
generally
my
go
to
for
noncraft
brews
its
almost
universally
carried
isnt
overly
expensive
and
most
beers
are
above
average
the
winter
lager
isnt
generally
a
favorite
of
mine
but
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
its
exceptionally
average
in
many
regards
while
being
above
in
a
few
there
is
a
pretty
nice
balance
in
the
flavor
of
malt
and
hops
which
is
a
staple
of
the
bock
style
and
the
highlight
of
the
drink
not
their
best
brew
in
my
opinion
but
a
worthy
bock
and
a
decent
holiday
staple
subtle
spice
flavor
not
over
powering
pours
a
nice
copper
tone
with
a
thick
head
head
settles
into
a
creamy
off
white
and
foamy
lace
that
displayed
excellent
retention
the
aroma
is
quite
strong
which
bothers
me
somewhat
very
grainy
smell
with
a
slight
element
of
not
fresh
bread
or
vegetables
that
for
me
is
slightly
off
putting
upon
first
tasting
the
flavor
reflected
the
aroma
however
the
taste
develops
into
a
pleasant
blend
of
earthy
spices
grainy
malt
and
smooth
finish
feel
is
medium
bodes
with
light
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
winter
but
not
my
favorite
my
favorite
installation
from
jim
koch
and
the
boys
at
sam
adams
its
a
solid
spiced
treat
i
keep
on
hand
all
winter
long
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
borders
the
line
between
a
quick
beer
and
a
slow
beer
im
sure
i
could
chug
it
if
i
wanted
to
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
by
far
nice
wellbalanced
flavorful
winter
holiday
beer
i
used
to
drink
this
a
lot
and
then
became
tired
of
it
and
took
a
break
for
a
couple
of
years
just
had
one
this
weekend
and
remembered
why
i
used
to
drink
it
a
lot
nice
spice
but
not
overdone
enjoyable
and
sessionable
overall
id
throw
this
above
shiner
and
the
other
texas
bocks
but
below
anchors
and
more
serious
beers
however
given
that
this
was
from
the
convenience
store
on
the
other
side
of
my
block
im
more
than
happy
about
it
sam
adams
always
seems
like
a
family
reunion
beer
to
me
but
this
ones
alright
ginger
cinnamon
toasted
nutty
malt
caramel
and
a
hint
of
orange
peel
form
the
aroma
spices
are
subtle
in
comparison
to
the
melanoidin
character
flavor
reveals
fruity
specialty
malt
and
orange
at
the
base
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
weaving
throughout
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
orange
dominates
overwhelming
the
bock
notes
the
spices
are
fairly
subtle
but
ginger
emerges
in
the
aftertaste
bottle
from
the
12
pack
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brown
amber
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
persists
for
a
while
leaving
spotty
lace
on
the
sides
aromas
of
cinnamon
and
citrus
with
a
caramel
brown
sugary
malt
to
back
it
up
the
flavor
is
rich
and
dark
sugary
malts
with
a
spicy
citrusy
bite
to
counter
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
ive
had
this
many
times
in
the
past
and
its
never
been
my
favorite
but
today
with
a
grilled
cheese
and
some
cracked
pepper
chips
it
just
worked
ar
around
greater
boston
area
they
are
definitely
an
illegal
pay
for
play
participant
they
are
the
big
players
in
ma
budlight
is
not
considered
a
beer
here
so
much
is
expected
of
sam
adams
but
they
are
always
the
sucky
beer
avoid
them
and
always
go
for
real
local
beer
that
i
am
not
going
to
mention
here
you
have
to
try
to
taste
yourselves
its
a
good
beer
smoth
finish
that
you
would
expect
from
samuel
adams
brand
with
a
nice
hardy
taste
but
not
reals
heavy
leaving
room
for
one
more
pours
with
a
small
light
brown
head
is
dark
amber
in
color
has
aromas
of
orange
peel
malts
and
hops
initial
taste
is
sweet
from
a
balance
of
malts
hops
and
the
brewed
orange
peels
the
finishing
taste
is
created
from
the
persistence
of
the
orange
peels
combined
with
cinnamon
and
a
hint
of
ginger
seems
like
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
next
to
the
fireplace
on
a
cold
day
overall
im
going
to
agree
with
the
adjunct
hippie
on
this
one
the
winter
lager
is
fairly
decent
but
its
not
a
bock
i
liked
it
better
at
the
beginning
than
toward
the
end
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
it
was
offered
to
me
and
i
might
seek
it
out
in
a
situation
where
the
only
alternatives
are
bud
light
and
other
weak
aals
i
poured
this
beer
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
foamy
head
that
dissipates
into
a
good
lacing
the
color
is
dark
and
reminds
me
of
cola
a
bit
as
for
taste
very
strong
hops
with
a
bit
of
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
overall
i
find
this
beer
drinkable
but
i
much
prefer
the
regular
boston
lager
i
dont
generally
like
bock
beers
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
its
not
bad
the
last
batch
of
harvest
pumpkin
tasted
like
soap
too
the
names
randy
groves
in
florida
come
get
me
sammy
you
suck
edit
i
see
that
this
is
a
bock
it
is
absolutely
nothing
like
a
bock
i
would
knock
the
rating
down
but
its
too
good
to
do
that
approach
it
like
a
bock
and
youll
probably
be
sorely
disappointed
approach
it
like
a
winter
beer
and
youll
be
jumping
rope
well
crafted
bock
beer
with
spices
for
me
id
prefer
simply
the
bock
with
no
spices
worth
a
try
in
the
winter
or
fall
times
of
year
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
a
good
amount
of
acing
was
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
with
a
few
spices
the
taste
of
the
caramel
malts
comes
right
though
with
some
toffee
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
in
the
mix
as
well
very
tasty
with
perfect
carbonation
mediumbodied
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
a
tasty
brew
for
the
cooler
months
decent
beer
for
who
likes
malty
beers
with
lots
of
caramels
overall
a
good
anytime
lager
that
isnt
too
special
and
isnt
too
heavy
but
very
drinkable
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
coppery
amber
with
a
one
finger
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
mild
caramel

slight
holiday
spicing

mild

light
cinnamon
finishes
with
caramel
malt
and
light
grassy
hops
medium
bodied
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
a
pleasant
light
bock
style
beer
with
an
appropriately
mild
holiday
spicing
is
as
i
expect
from
boston
beer
a
nicely
made
mellow
ale
that
doesnt
push
the
envelope
but
is
a
satisfactory
and
enjoyable
example
of
its
style
following
my
last
gulp
the
empty
glass
smelled
just
like
a
ginger
bread
cookie
it
reminded
me
of
some
childhood
memories
this
was
by
far
the
highlight
of
this
beer
for
me
overall
this
is
a
decent
straightup
bock
there
are
better
bocks
and
better
winter
seasonals
on
the
market
i
had
this
with
a
homemade
pizza
and
some
roasted
vegetables
and
it
didnt
fail
to
compliment
the
meal
but
it
didnt
add
much
either
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
only
get
again
if
it
was
the
only
thing
on
draft
that
wasnt
a
bmc
lager
or
a
light
beer
overall
the
taste
is
what
stands
out
here
and
i
am
a
fan
easily
drinkable
good
for
a
winter
beer
im
a
sa
fan
and
have
had
a
dozen
of
their
brews
this
is
my
least
favorite
just
not
enough
there
easy
to
drink
but
the
sour
finish
is
a
turn
off
for
me
taste
like
a
honey
lager
where
is
the
winter
spices
not
terrible
but
i
wont
be
buying
again
to
many
other
great
winter
brews
to
choose
from
oeasy
drinking
but
flavor
is
not
overly
compelling
overall
still
my
favorite
seasonal
from
sam
adams
excluding
two
times
first
when
double
bock
was
seasonal
and
then
when
noble
pils
was
seasonal
not
the
most
special
anymore
but
i
still
enjoy
it
it
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
a
little
bit
of
a
pumped
up
version
of
boston
lager
this
is
very
drinkable
neither
the
smell
nor
the
drink
blows
me
away
but
together
i
could
find
myself
drinking
this
all
the
time
the
main
things
i
gather
are
malt
honey
and
spices
i
will
get
this
again
next
winter
out
of
habit
of
course
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
red
orange
with
a
nice
one
finger
slightly
off
white
head
smells
of
winter
spices
and
slight
berry
nice
compliment
to
the
malt
tones
tastes
of
some
dark
roasted
malts
with
fruity
tones
such
as
berries
with
very
slight
wintertime
spice
beer
is
carbonated
nicely
light
body
sessionable
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
a
really
good
beer
perhaps
not
what
i
would
pin
as
great
spice
beer
or
bock
for
that
matter
its
a
very
drinkable
and
nice
lager
dark
amber
color
with
a
great
creamy
head
and
mild
carbonation
fruity
spiced
aroma
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
more
depth
and
malt
the
carbonation
is
more
noticeable
than
it
appears
maybe
a
bit
too
crisp
not
bad
but
slightly
sweet
finishes
a
bit
maltier
o
a
solid
winter
bock
just
like
the
name
implies
this
is
a
tasty
beer
for
cooler
weather
brings
to
mind
winter
holidays
sitting
in
front
of
a
fireplace
easy
drinking
strong
taste
and
aroma
cinnamon
and
spice
mostly
overall
its
about
what
id
expect
from
a
standard
beer
from
sa
tostyle
wellmade
but
relatively
boring
but
its
a
fine
tasty
beer
that
would
be
great
with
a
meal
for
cooking
or
alone
i
think
i
might
actually
save
this
one
as
an
idea
to
help
bridge
macro
drinkers
into
craft
isnt
that
so
often
the
domain
of
sam
adams
o
decent
i
used
to
like
this
a
lot
but
it
just
isnt
my
kinda
beer
these
days
still
i
like
the
cherry
in
it
though
overall
even
with
low
expectations
this
beer
dissapointed
o
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
winter
brew
its
like
a
cute
little
nephew
to
the
german
weizenbocks
ebd
614
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
nice
ruby
hue
solid
head
with
a
well
formed
lacing
nose
is
of
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
spice
light
medium
bodied
normal
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
quite
interesting
and
well
balanced
it
has
a
slight
sweetness
over
a
soft
spice
background
crisp
finish
with
a
carbonation
burst
of
slight
bitterness
and
spice
a
very
well
done
lager
big
fan
of
this
one
smells
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
with
hits
of
citrus
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
mixture
of
the
spices
and
citrus
with
a
slightly
bitter
after
taste
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
although
doesnt
really
remind
me
that
much
of
winter
more
of
a
fall
beer
o
maybe
my
favorite
offering
from
boston
beer
co
yeah
so
i
feel
that
it
is
more
of
a
fall
beer
than
that
of
winter
so
what
still
a
damn
fine
brew
that
gets
the
job
done
in
january
on
tap
at
one
of
the
bars
in
denver
international
airport
dark
amber
color
almost
brown
aroma
is
malty
not
much
hint
of
spice
flavor
is
a
nice
malty
lager
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
need
to
start
giving
more
sam
adams
beers
a
chance
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
tasty
overall
an
average
winter
offering
from
samuel
adams
aromas
fell
a
little
flat
for
the
category
and
i
was
hoping
for
depth
in
the
flavours
o
nice
crowd
pleaser
for
the
winter
months
not
a
lot
to
get
excited
about
here
but
certainly
nothing
to
complain
about
may
pick
up
a
12pack
for
the
wife
and
guests
and
the
occasional
bottle
for
myself
o
more
full
bodied
and
flavorful
than
i
expected
very
drinkable
beer
o
a
great
holiday
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
again
this
is
a
nice
lager
from
sam
adams
this
is
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
drinking
all
year
round
samuel
adams
winter
lager
is
one
of
my
winter
favourites
its
a
very
full
bodied
and
bold
beer
by
any
standards
rather
complex
and
filling
but
more
willing
to
let
you
have
another
after
another
ive
had
sam
adams
winter
lager
in
a
bottle
can
and
on
tap
honestly
theres
no
difference
in
taste
other
than
the
can
is
a
wee
bit
more
foamy
like
other
sam
adams
cans
available
the
appearance
is
more
of
a
dark
brownish
black
like
most
bock
beers
and
dark
lagers
looks
imitating
at
first
to
most
light
beer
drinkers
but
its
easy
to
get
used
to
smellwise
its
more
of
a
full
bodied
smell
with
a
bit
of
ginger
in
there
tastewise
its
a
rather
complex
beer
without
being
too
pretentious
in
itself
very
full
and
bold
with
some
ginger
and
spices
that
arent
easily
obvious
in
the
mouth
sam
adams
winter
lager
is
very
tame
and
smooth
very
odd
for
a
full
bock
lager
like
as
such
really
overall
samuel
adams
winter
lager
is
probably
the
best
winter
beer
available
in
my
opinion
i
mean
i
do
like
harpoons
narragensetts
or
long
trails
offerings
but
sams
winter
lager
will
always
be
a
winter
favourite
even
though
i
prefer
octoberfest
but
winter
is
a
close
second
o
really
not
half
bad
it
does
have
s
good
flavor
especially
if
you
are
in
to
malty
beers
its
not
overpowering
very
drinkable
poured
with
a
half
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
color
is
quite
nice
a
clear
dark
amberlight
ruby
not
too
much
of
a
nose
to
it
malt
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
slight
citrus
hop
aroma
beer
itself
tastes
about
the
same
malty
get
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
residue
bite
from
the
ginger
then
hops
which
arent
very
heavy
feels
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
like
something
the
should
be
for
thirst
quenching
in
the
summer
pretty
good
overall
one
of
the
better
sam
seasonals
ive
had
wouldnt
turn
one
down
overall
this
lager
fits
well
into
the
winter
scene
with
its
pleasant
dose
of
spice
always
pick
this
one
up
in
the
winter
as
its
well
priced
for
its
flavor
o
nothing
too
complex
here
but
its
smooth
and
drinks
nice
i
like
the
heavier
mouthfeel
presented
here
combined
with
the
caramel
its
nice
for
drinking
when
you
want
something
descent
but
dont
want
to
concentrate
too
hard
on
picking
out
all
the
flavors
feel
creamy
and
weighty
as
it
should
be
surprising
from
a
mass
house
well
done
buy
a
case
for
christmas
this
is
a
decent
bock
and
well
worth
the
7
50
a
six
pack
purchase
price
this
is
the
7th
sam
ive
had
pretty
strong
medicine
big
flavor
a
smoky
wheat
bock
nice
spicy
flavor
to
it
but
you
can
taste
the
booze
too
nice
dark
brownish
color
with
a
potent
nose
relatively
little
head
one
of
sams
better
seasonals
always
like
to
grab
some
in
their
winter
mix
pack
very
minimal
head
upon
pouring
nice
dark
slightly
reddish
appearance
like
most
sa
brews
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
not
too
heavy
and
actually
very
light
for
a
bock
cant
really
get
any
kind
of
specific
aroma
so
i
guess
they
were
able
to
achieve
a
nice
balance
of
all
the
spices
nothing
to
special
for
me
but
easy
to
drink
overall
a
solid
lager
but
not
much
more
than
that
i
personally
feel
it
could
have
been
better
balanced
or
even
leaned
more
heavily
on
the
spices
to
create
something
a
little
more
winterish
the
orange
peel
seemed
the
dominant
addition
and
i
thought
cinnamon
and
ginger
would
have
made
better
stars
for
a
winter
lager
samuel
adams
winter
lager
3
55
overall
i
liked
the
taste
so
dont
get
turned
off
by
the
smell
diamonds
are
forever
very
nice
color
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
less
than
a
finger
of
head
not
a
very
significant
scent
light
orange
peel
taste
is
great
extremely
smooth
again
the
orange
peel
comes
through
mouthfeel
is
also
great
perfectly
carbonated
overall
definitely
something
i
could
drink
more
of
the
first
thing
that
strikes
me
about
this
beer
is
the
deep
reddish
brown
color
it
has
when
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
you
can
taste
noble
hops
which
is
the
hops
sam
adams
puts
in
a
lot
of
their
beers
i
love
how
you
can
taste
the
orange
and
cinnamon
with
every
sip
that
you
take
delicious
beer
perfect
for
a
nice
cold
day
good
beer
here
may
grab
a
12
of
cans
or
might
just
take
a
couple
more
from
my
brother
either
way
give
it
a
shot
o
i
dont
know
if
its
worth
the
1
minute
commercial
samuel
adams
give
this
beer
but
hey
its
really
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
a
little
thin
in
aroma
and
lacking
complexity
but
its
quite
drinkable
by
anyones
standers
this
could
hardly
offend
a
valley
girl
whos
palate
is
used
to
nothing
but
white
fn
zin
psych
i
went
way
too
far
props
sam
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
flavors
are
pretty
bland
and
none
are
very
obvious
most
of
the
flavors
are
a
mixture
of
spices
o
this
is
a
rock
solid
effort
by
bbc
a
sam
adams
lager
i
enjoy
and
would
not
mind
having
again
you
know
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
sam
adams
seasonals
i
would
drink
it
if
its
the
only
craft
option
but
beyond
that
there
are
much
better
options
price
like
most
sa
beers
is
really
good
so
thats
a
plus
overall
this
is
a
good
bock
but
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
heavier
since
it
is
a
winter
beer
o
this
is
better
than
your
basic
store
bought
beer
but
somewhat
lacking
in
flavor
against
other
winter
lagers
i
personally
think
that
this
beer
is
lacking
compared
to
the
last
few
seasons
lots
almost
seems
like
sam
adams
faked
this
one
a
bit
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
especially
for
the
price
i
doubt
i
seek
it
out
again
however
finishes
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
and
a
definite
warming
effect
snagged
a
sixpack
from
the
same
place
i
found
the
superlative
lagunitas
little
sumpin
see
that
review
i
am
a
big
advocate
of
boston
lager
and
like
this
brewery
well
enough
gimmicks
like
chocolate
cherry
porter
notwithstanding
why
does
everyone
have
to
murder
porter
with
all
kinds
of
additives
and
random
flavorings
like
chai
spices
and
sock
lint
its
not
already
an
interesting
style
its
kinda
like
how
a
beer
is
magically
made
wintery
by
chucking
in
some
spices
bock
is
already
supposed
to
be
pretty
hearty
and
rich
ahem
i
digress
this
winter
bock
pours
a
rather
pretty
redorange
amber
color
with
around
three
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
and
a
pleasant
aroma
of
mellow
rich
dark
malts
caramel
molasses
a
little
sour
dark
fruit
like
sultanas
nice
but
the
whole
aroma
is
downplayed
like
great
song
on
the
radio
that
you
want
to
crank
up
but
the
volume
knob
is
unfortunately
busted
taste
is
similar
with
some
toasty
bread
crusts
biscuits
barleybased
coffee
substitute
and
crackers
subdued
caramel
and
molasses
as
per
the
nose
and
candied
plums
along
with
herbalspicy
hop
notes
some
would
have
the
cinnamon
ginger
and
orange
peel
spice
addition
amped
up
i
respectfully
disagree
this
is
actually
an
example
of
skilled
spice
use
in
brewing
the
spices
provide
a
background
warmth
and
some
aromatics
but
not
at
the
expense
of
everything
else
i
get
a
little
sulphur
on
the
nose
and
perhaps
the
palate
as
well
maybe
a
hint
of
dms
but
at
expected
levels
for
a
lager
and
these
components
add
complexity
without
being
nasty
fairly
light
body
but
semichewy
nonetheless
and
the
finish
is
quite
nice
the
malts
stick
around
theres
some
hop
leaf
and
a
floral
sweet
spice
like
licorice
tablets
has
some
of
the
sweet
and
sour
character
of
old
world
porters
this
beer
used
to
be
higher
abv
and
more
flavorful
or
so
i
read
wasnt
into
beer
back
then
too
bad
its
been
neutered
a
bit
because
its
pretty
good
now
and
must
have
been
even
better
back
in
the
day
compare
it
to
anchor
bock
which
has
bolder
flavors
but
perhaps
less
complexity
overall
not
half
bad
personally
this
could
very
well
fall
under
the
brown
ale
style
but
hey
i
dont
make
those
sort
of
calls
a
tad
more
spice
could
not
hurt
great
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
night
a
pinch
too
sweet
to
make
this
a
session
beer
worth
trying
but
is
low
on
my
list
of
musthave
winter
seasonals
o
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
a
holiday
brew
i
wouldnt
buy
a
twelve
pack
of
just
the
winter
lager
but
still
decent
as
i
do
with
a
lot
of
sam
adams
beers
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
the
flavors
while
enjoyable
are
subdued
or
a
bit
muted
overall
what
a
pleasant
brew
this
was
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
was
remarkable
with
a
deep
caramel
color
almost
like
a
fine
cognac
the
head
doesnt
stick
around
long
and
their
isnt
much
lacing
but
not
a
big
deal
the
scent
is
a
lot
like
the
taste
very
balanced
with
very
very
light
citrus
and
some
other
spices
which
sam
adams
claims
cinnamon
among
although
it
isnt
easy
to
pick
up
anything
specific
i
actually
got
some
ginger
and
something
of
a
coriander
scent
although
i
doubt
its
actually
in
the
beer
but
thats
fine
i
like
coriander
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
full
not
too
water
and
not
too
creamy
like
i
said
balance
was
their
aim
here
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
with
a
bouquet
of
spices
and
notes
none
of
which
jump
out
at
you
but
i
think
thats
why
this
recipe
works
so
well
hints
of
ginger
and
orange
for
sure
and
you
will
get
some
cinnamon
on
the
taste
something
i
didnt
get
from
the
scent
this
is
a
very
very
smooth
beer
and
this
is
something
anyone
can
enjoy
some
of
the
more
refined
beer
snobs
might
be
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
complexity
or
boldness
but
putting
this
in
perspective
as
a
fine
seasonal
brew
i
think
its
pretty
damn
good
and
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
not
bad
but
not
something
id
likely
go
to
again
overall
not
bad
but
i
expected
more
i
wouldnt
pass
one
up
if
offered
but
wouldnt
buy
a
case
of
it
either
i
think
highly
of
samuel
adams
because
i
know
that
they
have
the
potential
to
make
great
beers
and
they
have
a
number
of
excellent
winter
beers
too
especially
in
my
opinion
the
double
bock
and
the
fuzzywig
but
this
easytofind
offering
is
disappointing
the
spices
make
the
smell
and
taste
rather
confusing
the
beer
is
crisp
but
offers
nothing
special
in
the
mouthfeel
and
overall
the
beer
tastes
mediocre
and
confusing
this
a
dumbed
down
winter
beer
and
its
unfortunate
that
samuel
adams
doesnt
make
their
better
winter
beers
more
widely
available
the
verdict
its
ok
like
most
of
samuel
adams
offerings
this
is
craft
beer
dumbed
down
for
the
masses
drinkable
but
ultimately
bland
compared
to
the
many
great
seasonals
now
available
overall
this
is
very
disappointing
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
brew
i
remember
really
enjoying
it
last
yr
and
this
is
not
what
i
remember
great
beer
for
good
times
this
beer
is
my
all
time
favorite
commercial
mainstream
brew
1
on
the
mainstream
list
when
in
season
you
dont
need
a
reason
just
pick
up
this
beer
and
start
to
cheer
sam
adams
is
good
beer
you
wont
go
wrong
with
this
one
samuel
adams
winter
lager
is
a
super
clear
amber
beer
with
a
soft
thin
off
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
a
light
aroma
of
light
grain
orange
peel
and
ginger
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
light
slightly
watery
finish
the
mouth
is
left
just
a
little
gritty
its
lightly
flavored
with
malt
and
orange
peel
theres
a
little
bitterness
after
the
swallow
this
is
where
the
ginger
and
cardamom
come
out
this
is
just
kind
of
a
simple
session
beer
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
personality
but
its
certainly
quaffable
a
nice
seasonal
from
sam
adams
nothing
to
jump
up
and
down
about
but
a
very
solid
craft
beer
subtle
citrus
notes
and
like
spice
flavors
well
balanced
with
the
hop
bitterness
golden
color
with
a
white
head
clean
mouthfeel
rather
crisp
for
a
winter
lager
o
good
seasonal
variation
on
the
ubiquitous
boston
lager
nothing
spectacular
but
solid
ill
definitely
enjoy
this
brew
again
next
winter
overall
for
an
easily
accessible
beer
that
falls
into
the
pop
category
i
am
very
impressed
great
tasting
beer
smooth
warm
spicy
and
refreshing
an
easy
sell
for
those
not
willing
to
venture
into
more
adventurous
beers
nice
work
sam
body
depth
ok
and
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
spices
are
subdued
toasted
malt
flavor
dominates
lighter
bodied
than
i
would
expect
from
a
bock
but
the
firm
hop
bitterness
and
mediumthin
body
make
this
easy
drinking
and
you
could
easily
reach
for
another
one
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
samuel
adams
glass
deep
copper
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
lingers
on
and
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
is
winteresque
spices
but
nothing
really
stands
out
it
all
just
sort
of
blends
the
taste
is
about
the
same
there
is
definitely
some
winter
spice
action
here
but
at
the
end
there
isnt
really
anything
distinct
and
it
sort
of
tastes
muddled
its
certainly
not
bad
but
i
just
feel
like
focusing
on
one
or
two
of
the
seasonal
spices
would
make
this
beer
more
distinct
this
beer
pours
up
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
one
finger
foamy
white
head
a
little
bit
of
retention
and
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
mild
i
basically
only
get
a
nebulous
hard
to
describe
freshness
taste
is
goodbut
sort
of
one
dimensional
there
is
a
dry
taste
upfront
followed
by
a
dry
bitter
metallic
finish
mouthfeel
is
undistinctivebut
inoffensive
okay
but
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
have
more
o
again
not
a
bad
little
beer
from
sam
adams
nice
spice
characters
with
good
malty
body
good
abv
so
you
could
put
down
2
or
3
with
no
problem
o
fairly
complex
brew
in
regards
to
all
the
flavors
and
ingredients
that
seem
to
be
highlighted
but
its
very
well
balanced
considering
i
have
had
sa
brews
that
seem
to
be
overwhelmed
by
artificial
flavorings
chocolate
bock
cherry
wheat
to
name
a
few
but
this
one
seems
to
be
the
real
deal
this
is
my
favorite
beer
of
all
i
wish
it
was
not
a
seasonal
brew
it
flies
of
the
store
shelves
the
flavor
is
stronger
than
the
regular
boston
lager
and
the
taste
is
pleasant
without
feeling
heavy
i
like
lagers
so
this
hits
the
spot
please
mr
adams
consider
making
this
a
year
round
brew
thanks
to
my
uncle
for
the
tick
i
guess
o
this
is
another
example
of
a
great
beer
for
those
who
have
never
gone
beyond
the
light
lager
it
has
some
malt
flavor
without
being
overwhelming
theres
nothing
here
to
scare
anyone
away
for
myself
i
will
never
buy
this
but
for
the
style
and
for
what
it
is
it
serves
a
purpose
overall
good
for
sessions
and
campfires
with
roasted
hotdogs
overall
the
initial
perceptions
given
by
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
were
very
nice
unfortunately
subsequent
examples
of
both
couldnt
live
up
the
promise
and
the
beer
came
across
as
more
watery
than
expected
there
are
still
good
flavors
in
here
but
they
needed
to
be
cranked
up
a
notch
to
be
noticedespecially
the
sugars
which
are
almost
lost
malty
harvest
notes
o
not
an
overall
fan
of
sam
adams
but
this
is
a
good
choice
for
a
party
or
a
lame
bar
where
your
options
are
limited
and
you
want
to
throw
back
a
few
it
is
very
drinkable
and
a
lot
less
commercial
tasting
than
some
of
their
other
seasonal
brews
overall
this
is
a
well
blended
and
easy
to
drink
bock
it
is
not
as
flavor
packed
as
some
of
the
other
bocks
i
have
tasted
but
it
is
hard
to
beat
for
the
money
o
a
great
winter
beer
with
some
warming
qualities
to
it
this
lager
is
clean
crisp
and
quit
satisfying
all
while
being
one
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
this
will
be
one
i
will
look
forward
to
in
the
colder
months
for
now
on
give
it
a
try
you
will
not
be
disappointed
cheers
overall
im
surprised
by
this
beer
its
definitely
a
bavarian
style
lager
first
rich
sweet
malt
base
with
some
winter
spices
added
for
flavor
almost
as
an
after
thought
its
not
overly
sweet
at
any
point
the
candy
is
subtle
maybe
too
subtle
and
the
spices
are
very
muted
too
muted
while
it
is
a
winter
seasonal
ale
i
would
say
its
the
most
basic
christmaswinter
seasonal
ive
had
this
year
if
you
like
lagers
and
a
bit
of
variety
youll
like
this
beer
but
if
you
like
that
candy
sweetness
that
reminds
you
of
christmas
or
sitting
by
a
fireplace
this
one
may
not
fulfill
your
needs
its
worth
trying
because
the
malt
flavor
is
drinkable
but
im
surprised
how
muted
the
other
flavors
are

sam
adams
has
been
making
a
number
of
respectable
beers
lately
along
with
a
lot
of
forgettable
nondescript
standbys
this
beer
definitely
qualifies
as
one
of
the

overall
this
is
a
good
bock
style
good
flavor
balance
with
a
fair
amount
of
robustness
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
this
was
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
drinkability
a
solid
brew
upon
first
impression
it
is
not
too
festive
or
wintery
but
it
is
tasty
drinking
it
will
do
the
job
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
that
this
beer
at
least
be
given
a
try
during
the
winter
months
it
is
definitely
the
most
widely
distributed
and
most
well
known
winter
brew
but
dont
let
this
deter
you
from
giving
it
a
try
as
im
sure
it
will
come
to
hold
a
regular
spot
in
your
fridge
over
the
cold
season
o
this
beer
is
great
in
the
right
time
and
comes
at
a
great
price
too
i
always
grab
a
few
12
packs
of
this
every
winter
a
must
try
if
you
havnt
had
a
glass
with
dinner
at
applebees
served
in
a
weiss
beer
glass
beer
was
rich
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
head
with
good
lacing
and
retention
aroma
was
sweet
and
malty
with
spicy
notes
taste
was
a
nice
malt
hop
balance
with
a
definite
spice
and
caramel
background
mouthfeel
was
full
and
clean
with
a
nice
clean
aftertaste
great
seasonal
as
always
from
sam
adams
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
rich
and
flavorful
and
well
balanced
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
if
you
wanna
grab
a
sixer
and
just
hang
out
dont
know
how
often
i
could
drink
this
beer
though
great
for
winter
nights
copper
in
color
translucent
and
absent
of
any
haze
small
head
with
broken
bits
of
lacing
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
caramel
flavor
notes
are
slight
caramel
hops
and
spices
nothing
too
interesting
going
on
here
the
bodymouthfeel
is
above
average
but
wishing
for
some
stronger
flavors
overall
a
decent
beer
that
underdelivers
would
i
recommend
it
depends
on
the
other
options
available
but
if
at
a
beer
bar
or
store
with
a
wide
selection
id
probably
recommend
a
pass
but
not
take
any
offense
if
my
advice
was
ignored
the
beer
pours
a
candied
brown
bordering
on
amber
with
a
huge
fluffy
cream
head
with
yellowing
notes
the
beers
body
is
lager
clean
completely
free
of
any
haze
and
quite
translucent
though
the
beers
darkness
does
fight
this
a
little
bit
the
lacing
is
fat
and
sticky
leaving
webbing
behind
on
my
mug
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
spicy
with
a
little
too
much
cinnamon
burn
and
a
note
of
ginger
slight
citrus
notes
are
found
when
the
glass
is
swirled
and
underlying
all
the
smells
is
a
caramelly
smell
that
is
tinged
with
wheat
the
beer
tastes
abrasively
spicy
with
a
clear
cinnamon
burn
that
seems
to
hurt
the
other
flavors
the
beer
begins
with
light
caramel
malts
and
slight
cinnamon
before
opening
into
a
slightly
biscuity
malt
that
is
immediately
torn
out
of
the
mouth
by
the
cinnamon
spice
which
drowns
out
most
other
notes
and
lingers
in
the
mouth
slight
hints
of
the
ginger
and
orange
peel
can
be
felt
at
the
fringes
of
the
palate
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
can
be
tasted
but
this
is
all
below
the
cinnamon
which
is
rocking
around
on
the
palate
like
an
unwanted
elephant
this
flavor
is
much
spicier
than
i
recall
it
being
in
years
past
and
is
really
hurt
by
the
overwhelming
cinnamon
now
when
i
say
it
tastes
like
cinnamon
i
dont
mean
the
nice
cinnamon
flavors
of
a
baked
good
but
the
burn
with
a
slight
bitter
flavor
that
you
get
from
putting
too
much
cinnamon
in
your
mouth
in
case
anyone
was
thinking
i
was
just
complaining
about
the
taste
of
cinnamon
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
chew
to
it
carbonation
gives
a
little
bite
in
the
beginning
and
then
mellows
over
the
tongue
to
provide
a
clean
drink
though
the
spices
punch
nasty
burns
on
my
tongue
the
mouth
is
left
dry
with
a
spice
burn
after
the
beer
has
left
with
saliva
only
on
the
very
edges
of
my
tongue
overall
this
is
a
very
heavy
handed
beer
ive
had
a
couple
of
this
years
batch
and
i
have
to
say
that
the
boston
beer
company
really
overdid
the
spice
this
year
on
their
site
they
claim
they
searched
far
and
wide
this
year
to
bring
the
best
cinnamon
sticks
all
the
way
from
vietnam
and
while
i
applaud
them
on
finding
cool
foreign
ingredients
i
wish
they
would
stop
playing
with
a
recipe
that
tasted
perfectly
fine
last
year
this
beer
needs
to
tone
down
its
spice
so
that
other
flavors
can
be
enjoyed
i
am
a
little
weirded
out
that
no
one
else
has
said
anything
else
about
the
spice
for
this
years
version
so
maybe
it
was
just
my
pack
though
that
would
be
very
strange
perhaps
its
just
my
palate
anyways
its
cheap
and
easily
found
so
try
it
for
yourself
dont
trust
my
opinion
no
fan
but
not
really
fan
of
lagers
to
begin
with
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
then
this
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
not
overall
not
good
beer
is
is
quality
beer
i
had
had
this
for
years
and
will
keep
having
it
knowing
that
the
quality
that
i
am
drinking
is
quality
worth
having
go
to
a
bar
or
your
local
shop
and
treat
yourself
to
what
you
know
what
is
true
to
yourself
salud
overall
a
positive
surprise
its
a
nice
rich
lager
with
some
proper
flavour
but
not
too
overwhelming
overall
it
doesnt
taste
like
anything
really
aside
from
the
slight
hop
and
caramel
taste
there
are
better
bocks
and
winter
ales
out
there
than
this
overall
this
is
a
nice
tasting
brew
perfect
for
cool
winter
evening
and
very
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
or
anything
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
it
was
offered
to
me
either
taste
is
bright
lots
of
clean
dry
malt
with
some
biscuit
christmas
spices
nothing
offensive
here
very
tasty
but
very
sweet
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
light
slightly
creamy
with
high
carbonation
overall
a
great
session
beer
an
incredibly
plain
beer
but
not
a
bad
beer
i
remember
loving
this
to
death
a
few
years
ago
now
its
not
too
exciting
its
still
pretty
good
though
above
average
but
not
by
much
the
taste
was
slightly
malty
with
a
bit
of
ginger
but
it
was
very
weak
i
found
a
hint
of
cinnamon
but
it
was
sparse
and
fleeting
this
is
not
the
best
entry
from
samuel
adams
and
my
least
favorite
in
the
holiday
sampler
overall
a
rather
plain
but
drinkable
brew
a
little
bitter
finish
but
easily
sessionable
if
you
like
sam
adams
overall
honestly
a
little
plain
nothing
really
stands
out
all
that
much
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
nothing
exceptional
overall
average
winter
brew
i
always
enjoy
a
few
every
year
so
unfortunately
my
nose
is
plugged
up
so
i
didnt
get
the
full
experience
but
i
get
the
wheatbreadsmoky
flavor
and
i
enjoyed
the
mixture
of
spices
all
in
a
dark
brew
quite
enjoyable
winter
beer
even
if
it
is
a
bit
strong
on
the
aftertaste
very
filling
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
im
not
sure
how
much
it
fits
the
bock
style
but
the
toasted
and
caramelized
malts
are
there
as
it
is
neither
the
seasonal
spices
nor
the
malts
really
dominate
the
aroma
or
taste
i
wish
at
least
one
of
them
would
be
just
a
bit
more
pronounced
and
take
center
stage
regardless
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
wellsuited
to
the
season
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
o
not
special
really
not
particularly
flavorful
and
i
really
didnt
pick
up
and
spicesclovegingerorange
peel
o
not
bad
but
not
up
to
my
standards
for
a
good
winter
seasonal
beer
oan
interesting
combination
of
ingredients
used
here
and
overall
i
think
it
works
unique
and
tasty
with
plenty
of
different
malt
flavors
with
subtle
spicing
that
enhances
the
taste
well
done
enough
flavor
complexity
for
a
december
night
with
a
fresh
foot
of
snow
on
the
ground
like
today
yet
light
enough
for
several
in
a
sitting
o
its
ok
not
my
favorite
of
the
sam
seasonals
but
its
decent
o
toasty
kind
of
turns
to
ashes
in
my
mouth
after
half
a
bottle
nice
beer
for
a
seasonal
from
our
boston
brethren
especially
for
something
i
can
get
at
a
chain
restaurant
so
this
is
a
nice
winter
brew
its
heavy
enough
for
drinking
on
a
cold
winters
day
but
light
enough
that
you
have
no
problem
being
able
to
put
down
a
few
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
im
beginning
to
think
that
winter
spicy
lagers
arent
really
on
my
desired
beer
radar
it
wasnt
bad
just
not
something
im
going
to
spend
my
money
on
again
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
the
slightly
more
substantial
body
and
spices
make
it
a
perfect
beer
for
the
colder
weather
and
holiday
season
o
like
most
of
sam
adams
brews
to
me
not
terrible
but
far
from
memorable
o
solid
winter
lager
that
is
very
rich
but
highly
enjoyable
i
look
forward
to
sams
winter
every
year
and
this
is
not
the
dark
lager
i
was
expecting
like
the
label
says
pours
copper
color
with
a
white
head
and
tastes
like
a
beer
i
drink
in
october
still
very
good
but
does
not
present
itself
as
a
dark
winter
beer
pretty
bland
a
very
average
beer
it
also
has
some
earthy
notes
that
dont
mix
in
well
with
the
rest
of
it
a
strange
one
a
spiced
dark
wheat
lager
a
bit
too
lively
doesnt
have
the
smoothness
of
wheat
and
the
body
doesnt
quite
hold
the
spice
but
drinkable
id
buy
this
for
family
christmas
dinner
odecent
brew
isnt
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
still
a
really
drinkable
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
o
kind
of
not
true
to
the
style
kind
of
flawed
but
ive
still
drank
a
million
of
these
in
my
day
when
i
was
first
discovering
craft
beer
and
somehow
it
doesnt
seem
like
winter
until
i
have
at
least
one
ill
probably
be
drinking
this
in
sa
winter
classic
packs
until
i
die
so
far
sam
adams
just
does
not
do
it
for
me
the
only
one
of
their
beers
i
liked
so
far
is
the
octoberfest
o
ok
beer
with
some
nice
spice
characteristics
and
malty
body
simple
and
delicious
sam
adams
has
always
done
good
with
the
bocks
the
bock
pours
out
a
darkgolden
brown
with
a
lightly
tanned
head
the
head
pours
thick
but
disappears
quickly
as
though
it
were
wispy
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
incredible
my
nose
was
pleasantly
assaulted
with
the
aroma
of
spice
cinnamon
and
oranges
it
was
truly
great
i
was
surprised
at
the
rich
taste
of
this
lager
rivaling
their
boston
lager
in
my
opinion
i
could
distinctly
taste
everything
i
smelled
from
the
bottle
making
it
a
great
experience
overall
i
rated
it
a
little
lower
since
the
beer
did
leave
an
aftertaste
that
didnt
agree
with
me
nonetheless
i
still
have
one
bottle
left
of
this
stuff
and
i
think
i
might
just
crack
it
open
tonight
rjt
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
to
much
to
write
about
here
marzen
like
brew
very
malty
as
it
warms
spicey
up
front
citrus
out
back
meh
o
i
would
have
no
issues
with
passing
on
this
beer
in
the
future
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
recommend
www
brewreviewboston
blogspot
com
overall
it
is
heavy
and
warming
enough
to
make
for
a
decent
winter
beer
but
yet
not
too
heavy
to
take
away
its
more
sessionalbe
style
an
ok
seasonal
beer
would
be
better
with
more
spice
and
flavor
and
less
grain
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
receded
to
a
ring
of
white
leaving
some
lacing
pretty
good
looking
scents
of
caramel
sweet
malt
sweet
spices
cinnamonlike
and
dark
fruit
a
pretty
good
aroma
profile
sweet
spicy
and
inviting
flavor
begins
with
sweet
malt
and
caramel
with
a
moderate
level
of
floral
hop
bitterness
this
moves
into
some
indeterminable
sweet
spices
in
the
middle
alongside
the
malt
caramel
and
hops
and
some
breadiness
and
toasty
malt
flavors
the
finish
continues
those
flavors
with
a
nice
aftertaste
of
caramel
and
floral
hops
a
good
malty
sweet
yet
not
cloying
flavor
profile
quite
balanced
between
sweetness
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
easy
to
drink
fairly
dry
and
slightly
creamy
overall
not
a
bad
winter
beer
its
got
a
good
mix
of
sweet
malt
hops
and
spices
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
that
balance
well
together
and
make
for
a
good
drink
id
go
back
to
it
im
giving
this
a
2
because
it
made
me
sick
for
some
reason
twice
the
1st
time
i
had
it
i
was
drinking
on
an
empty
stomach
and
i
got
incredibly
drunk
after
only
2
beers
i
wound
up
drinking
about
5
or
6
and
even
though
i
ate
the
sick
feeling
never
went
away
and
i
felt
sick
the
next
day
too
tried
again
the
other
night
after
i
had
dinner
and
got
sick
again
after
only
drinking
4
its
not
normal
for
me
to
get
sick
on
4
5
or
even
10
beers
but
my
stomach
felt
like
it
was
a
washing
machine
there
is
probably
something
in
the
brew
that
doesnt
agree
with
me
this
year
ive
been
able
to
drink
this
in
years
past
and
has
been
my
favorite
winter
brew
until
this
year
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
large
white
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
very
subtly
spicy
in
its
character
there
is
a
slight
citrus
and
a
very
faint
alcohol
aroma
as
well
taste
has
typical
lager
characteristics
the
spiciness
comes
through
right
away
along
with
a
slight
sweetness
and
the
beer
is
balanced
with
a
nice
bite
towards
the
finish
high
carbonation
medium
body
and
watery
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
slightly
above
average
similar
in
flavor
to
boston
lager
with
more
spice
character
to
me
there
is
definitely
an
off
flavor
present
in
this
beer
that
leads
to
an
almost
stale
character
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
by
far
but
decent
for
the
style
they
were
going
for
tastefeel
this
to
me
is
a
lot
like
an
amber
the
malts
are
pretty
huge
in
this
the
taste
is
similar
to
samuel
adams
pumpkin
ale
mixed
with
their
oktoberfest
the
bottle
mentions
some
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
its
there
but
appropriately
its
more
in
the
background
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
even
get
a
tinge
of
sourness
or
something
in
there
on
the
finish
which
makes
this
beer
pretty
thirst
quenching
a
great
winter
beer
and
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
samuel
adams
seasonals
a
decent
winter
seasonal
from
samuel
adams
o
enjoyable
and
relatively
easy
to
drink
though
the
spice
flavors
are
a
little
too
intense
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
session
pouring
much
darker
than
their
regular
lager
shades
of
red
brown
and
amber
blend
to
create
a
beautiful
color
palette
notes
of
pine
cardamom
and
orange
drift
of
the
very
thick
head
and
when
you
discover
that
the
brewery
used
ginger
cinnamon
and
orange
zest
to
make
their
winter
seasonal
the
melange
of
aromas
makes
sense
on
the
tongue
just
what
youd
expect
form
a
great
snow
seasonal
mild
hop
presence
a
slight
ginger
bite
mixed
a
fuller
sweetness
from
the
cinnamon
and
orange
thick
and
creamy
reminiscent
of
cream
sodas
with
a
warm
lingering
finish
a
perfect
beer
for
sipping
near
the
fireplace
enjoying
conversation
with
good
friends
in
a
cozy
room
or
snuggling
up
with
that
special
someone
bypass
food
with
this
pint
it
shines
all
on
its
own
and
strongly
echoes
the
flavors
of
the
season
open
one
up
and
find
some
mistletoe
cheers
o
drinkable
but
not
particularly
tasty
wouldnt
recommend
or
purchase
could
be
compelled
to
drink
again
o
this
was
a
betterthanaverage
sam
adams
beer
but
not
by
much
a
respectable
cheap
dark
lager
if
thats
your
thing
and
you
cant
find
any
boston
lager
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
clear
dark
copper
with
a
soapy
quickly
dissipating
white
head
the
carbonation
appears
to
be
mild
the
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
with
some
caramel
sweetness
the
spices
are
pretty
subtle
i
get
some
of
the
orange
zest
and
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
theres
a
nice
malt
backbone
here
with
some
cinnamon
and
ginger
bite
that
builds
up
as
you
drink
it
i
get
the
orange
zest
as
well
theres
the
caramel
sweetness
that
adds
to
the
backbone
pretty
well
there
is
also
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
enjoy
drinking
when
it
comes
into
season
a
descent
full
bodied
lager
with
some
spice
to
it
this
might
be
the
best
beer
from
the
boston
beer
company
a
perfect
winter
seasonal
spiced
with
cinnamon
ginger
and
a
hint
of
orange
i
cant
get
enough
its
not
strong
but
the
spices
do
help
give
the
beer
a
warming
property
to
it
its
a
tasty
warming
drinkable
beer
to
look
for
every
year
o
i
cant
say
i
loved
this
one
the
spice
levels
couldve
certainly
been
higher
and
the
overall
beer
better
balanced
and
interesting
it
is
a
fairly
easy
drinker
just
nothing
exciting
i
love
this
beer
for
what
it
is
an
everyday
winter
beer
nothing
wrong
with
that
good
beer
for
the
season
very
heavy
with
a
bitterhoppy
aftertaste
more
than
i
was
expecting
in
a
lager
not
overly
impressed
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
from
time
to
time
like
most
of
sams
offerings
it
was
much
better
from
the
tap
well
crafted
and
fairly
inexpensive
for
a
fancy
man
beer
i
think
next
time
though
i
will
stick
to
the
boston
lager
a
tasty
winter
style
lager
samuel
adams
usually
does
not
disappoint
easy
to
drink
fairly
cheap
and
highly
sessionable
drink
this
one
next
to
a
fireplace
overall
decent
winter
brew
offering
straight
out
of
the
bottle
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
better
brews
in
the
bunch
but
a
day
later
and
poured
into
a
glass
i
dont
find
it
nearly
as
interesting
nonetheless
its
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
its
not
a
deal
breaker
in
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
o
nice
a
good
beer
for
this
time
of
year
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
sam
adams
winter
variety
packs
want
to
have
it
on
tap
one
day
sa
seasonal
on
tap
i
assume
its
mostly
fresh
this
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
finger
thick
off
white
head
which
has
good
retention
the
smells
are
malty
some
toffee
nutty
caramel
and
a
hint
of
molasses
the
feel
is
medium
ish
the
taste
is
good
enough
similar
to
the
smells
a
little
nutty
toffee
with
other
malts
low
hop
bite
o
overall
i
expected
this
beer
to
at
least
be
good

do
have
to

change
of

actually
prefer
the

very
good
beer
that

the
flavors
work
well
together
and
it
is
not

heavy
looking

to
my
next
one

but
pretty
good
for
a
craft
brewery
with
as
big
a
presence
as
sam
adams
something
im
sure
would
go
well
with
many
different
folks
at
the
holidays
to
ward
off
the
chill
ive
had
better
winter
lagers
to
be
sure
with
no
head
the
beer
was
vibrant
and
crystal
in
appearance
smells
of
sweet
malt
bitter
hop
and
faint
alcohol
round
out
the
nose
palate
is
spicy
with
a
good

you
want
a

combined

samuel

winter
lager
is
a
very
good
beer
and
is
a
good
compliment
for
steak
highly
recommended
d
extremely
drinkable
it
is
going
down
like
im
in
a
frat
house
the
smooth
malty
flavor
is
very
pleasant
and
leaves
very
little
aftertaste
making
this
beer
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
an
excellent
mainstream
winter
beer
that
most
anyone
can
enjoy
d
pleasantly
surprised
as
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
going
in
nice
character
overall
but
it
gets
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
by
the
end
overall
winter
lager
imo
is
the
best
of
the
pure
sam
seasonals
i
e
noble
pils
summer
ale
octoberfest
and
this
i
always
find
myself
drinking
some
during
the
winter
even
with
the
plethora
of
other
great
winter
and
christmas
beers
out
there
this
beer
isnt
remarkable
but
its
solid
verdict
not
disappointing
for
a
winter
brew
it
has
enough
complex
flavors
for
me
and
most
everybody
without
being
a
hard
drinker
at
some
times
thin
and
not
very
intense
with
flavor
it
still
remains
a
fairly
impressive
sam
adams
beer
and
i
wouldnt
mind
making
it
a
winter
season
regular
b
3
7
like
many
have
said
i
am
also
a
sucker
for
sam
adams
seasonal
beers
but
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
the
bottle
tastes
like
it
has
been
handcrafted
individually
just
for
the
person
who
is
consuming
it
the
mixture
of
spices
in
the
beer
is
perfect
not
to
much
and
not
to
little
i
would
rather
have
the
regular
sam
adams
but
not
by
too
much
i
am
a
sucker
for
all
of
sam
adams
seasonals
i
like
the
octoberfest
better
than
the
winter
lager
but
that
being
said
the
winter
lager
is
still
a
very
solid
beer
there
is
a
deep
citrus
flavor
mixed
with
some
holiday
spices
and
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
sam
adams
winter
lager
is
truly
a
great
cold
weather
drink
this
winter
lager
pours
a
medium
dark
amber
color
with
a
good
long
lasting
head
right
away
you
take
in
the
scents
of
malts
and
hops
upon
tasting
there
is
a
fantastic
mixture
of
spices
absolutely
delightful
on
a
cold
winter
night
overall
is
decently
enjoyable
the
beer
is
worthy
of
the
season
drinkability
far
less
spiced
that
i
expected
and
in
that
its
easy
to
drink
cheers
as
much
as
i
want
to
really
like
this
beer
theres
just
a
few
characteristics
that
bring
it
down
md
a
medium
bodied
feel
with
the
usual
mass
craft
drinkability
i
definitely
lose
a
bit
in
the
mouthfeel
here
the
body
is
medium
but
feels
a
touch
fuller
to
me
and
carbonation
is
adequate
to
add
to
the
smooth
feel
but
not
too
much
to
go
beyond
that
d
nothing
would
prevent
easy
drinking
except
for
my
dislike
of
the
taste
i
could
have
multiple
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
d
i
dont
have
a
problem
drinking
this
beer
it
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
given
that
one
is
enough
for
me
i
picked
this
up
because
it
was
cheap
and
i
just
wanted
a
not
so
complex
brew
to
enjoy
while
reading
this
was
perfect
i
didnt
spend
the
entire
time
trying
to
detect
every
subtle
quality
i
was
able
to
just
enjoy
when
i
want
a
break
from
more
complex
brews
this
would
be
one
i
would
go
to
medium
body
and
carbonation
dry
with
a
bitter
almost
sour
aftertaste
not
bad
but
not
a
beer
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
d
drinks
great
for
a
winter
ale
not
bad
not
bland
not
too
spicy
good
balance
for
wonderful
winter
action
easy
to
drink
but
not
water
easy
drinking
but
uneventful
a
nice
beer
to
share
with
friends
pretty
good
lager
could
session
this
and
enjoy
it
nothing
to
go
wild
over
but
i
could
see
having
this
again
in
the
future
overall
quite
a
nice
little
lager
i
enjoy
these
winter
and
fall
lagers
so
much
more
on
the
whole
than
runofthemill
lagers
theres
so
much
more
flavour
and
depth
to
them
without
them
getting
so
complex
that
they
overwhelm
you
a
great
beer
to
just
sit
and
drink
on
the
holidays
now
how
come
they
can
get
this
in
newfoundland
and
not
in
pei
were
so
much
closer
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
liked
this
beer
more
than
their
boston
lager
and
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
not
only
for
taste
but
it
was
pretty
well
priced
drank
while
eating
almonds
mouthfeel
is
very
satisfying
as
the
richness
of
the
beer
imparts
a
satisfying
warming
quality
as
i
drink
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is

great

seasonal

is
also

winter
stews

the

smell
nice

character

is

spiced
clean
flavor
sooo
much
better
than
the
double
bock
from
s
a
brewing
co
decent
viscosity
to
the
beer
suiting
mouthfeel
very
similar
to
pumpkin
beers
of
the
fall
with
out
pumpkin
and
with
lager
yeast
i
am
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
d
im
definitely
a
biased
ale
man
so
lagers
arent
exactly
my
cupotea
or
ale
i
guess
ha
so
with
that
in
mind
its
a
little
easier
to
understand
my
criticism
with
lager
drinkability
its
certainly
one
of
the
best
american
lagers
that
ive
had
along
with
yeungling
and
it
has
a
nice
full
flavor
however
its
ultimate
lack
of
real
complexity
coupled
with
my
finding
it
a
bit
cloying
keeps
me
from
reaching
for
another
definitely
one
of
my
goto
lagers
though
and
one
i
keep
going
back
to
around
the
holiday
season
especially
considering
its
inclusion
in
the
sam
adams
holiday
sampler
drinkability
nicely
balanced
and
a
lower
abv
than
traditional
bocks
make
this
a
nice
holiday
brew
a
very
drinkable
winter
lager
its
not
as
jampacked
with
christmas
spices
as
other
winter
ales
but
what
is
there
is
nice
and
in
decent
balance
id
never
buy
a
bottle
but
when
the
tap
list
isnt
too
impressive
this
is
a
brew
that
can
be
relied
on
pours
a
clean
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
malty
lager
standardness
hints
of
spice
mainly
cinnamon
in
the
taste
cinnamon
stands
out
with
a
standard
lager
undertones
a
small
cinnamon
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
cinnamon
aftertaste
big
cinnamon
and
still
quite
lager
like
average
this
is
my
favorite
brew
out
of
the
holiday
pack
it
has
a
deep
dark
red
color
with
medium
almond
head
malty
smell
with
some
caramel
the
flavor
and
drinkability
are
off
the
charts
not
as
spicy
as
some
xmas
brews
but
thats
why
i
love
it
christmas
ale
from
great
lakes
is
very
good
but
this
goes
down
easier
for
me
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
d
the
nose
seemed
a
little
plain
but
the
spices
and
light
hops
really
round
out
the
flavours
easy
drinking
enough
to
be
a
nice
winter
session
beer
overall
this
is
pretty
much
a
last
resort
for
places
that
dont
carry
craft
beer
id
take
the
standard
boston
lager
over
this
every
time
poured
from
the
bottle
a
amber
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
faded
and
left
trace
amount
of
lacing
for
the
remainder
of
the
beer
smell
is
of
caramel
and
toasted
malt
some
citrusy
hops
and
a
faint
cinaminherbaly
spice
note
taste
is
mostly
sweet
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
cinamin
and
spice
with
a
tiny
citrusy
hoppy
twang
this
beer
seems
subdoed
from
years
past
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
light
very
light
bodied
beer
drinkability
is
quite
easy
on
this
one
nothing
too
comples
or
over
spiced
good
balance
but
i
could
have
used
a
bit
more
body
and
presence
by
the
spice
and
hops
in
this
beer
d
very
high
not
much
to
this
one
just
okay
would
not
buy
in
a
6er
i
got
a
growler
of
this
to
enjoy
during
a
football
game
and
its
an
easydrinking
brew
in
both
decency
and
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
not
kill
you
prior
to
finishing
it
cheers
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
in
one
sitting
another
good
holiday
one
from
sam
adams
drinkabilty
anyone
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
and
not
get
sick
with
it
i
would
rather
stick
to
my
craft
beers
and
sample
many
throughout
the
night
but
then
again
samuel
adams
isnt
my
favorite
brewery
with
my
ongoing
pattern
of
trying
holidaywinter
ales
i
discovered
this
one
was
lowest
on
my
list
so
far
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
ginger
and
cinnamon
with
some
toffee
and
wheat
mixed
in
a
little
bit
spicier
than
i
was
expecting
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
aroma
i
get
some
wheat
ginger
cinnamon
caramel
and
toffee
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pretty
good
but
nothing
too
exciting
overall
its
pretty
average
i
would
buy
it
again
though
and
it
definitely
is
nice
and
comforting
to
curl
up
with
under
a
blanket
with
the
dog
while
watching
some
football
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
sam
adams
line
of
brews
but
this
one
was
decent
and
more
drinkable
to
me
than
some
their
other
brews
perhaps
it
was
a
good
tapping
at
the
pub
which
i
had
it
still
plenty
of
flavor
but
much
more
drinkable
and
smooth
than
say
their
boston
ale
very
light
hop
aftertaste
nice
color
good
beer
jim
i
was
dissapointed
with
this
beer
it
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
tan
head
that
went
away
very
quicly
at
first
taste
i
get
the
hops
bitterness
and
then
i
taste
the
ginger
i
think
the
bitterness
also
comes
from
the
orange
peel
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
i
think
thats
all
i
really
need
of
this
beer
this
beer
was
very
average
in
every
way
and
nothing
stood
out
d
i
could
definitely
kick
back
with
a
few
of
these
nothing
to
crazy
going
on
here
but
a
solid
brew
that
ill
probably
have
again
before
the
seasons
change
samuel
adams
continues
to
amaze
winter
lager
is
fantastic
drunk
straight
from
the
bottle
caramel
malty
flavor
enough
hops
to
neutralize
the
sweetness
otherwise
pretty
watery
my
recollection
was
of
a
beer
with
more
body
and
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
has
some
carbonation
but
doesnt
have
the
crispness
of
other
lagers
very
drinkable
though
overall
solid
beer
good
option
for
a
winter
brew
the
spices
are
not
overpowering
which
can
be
a
problem
with
some
spiced
beers
i
feel
it
is
best
with
an
aggressive
pour
and
a
couple
min
to
warm
up
drinkability
has
a
clean
finish
that
makes
me
want
more
sam
adams
does
it
once
again
i
will
admit
that
i
am
a
very
big
fan
of
their
beers
specially
for
a
high
end
beer
with
such
a
beautiful
colorful
top
the
body
presents
a
beautiful
amber
color
its
smell
of
orange
ginger
and
grounded
cinnamon
the
taste
is
smooth
very
refreshing
experience
its
not
lame
or
dry
this
kind
of
beer
will
creep
up
on
you
you
cant
drink
real
fast
or
down
them
you
got
to
take
exceptional
sips
to
enjoy
its
lusty
aroma
i
will
admit
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
yet
o
all
in
all
a
good
beer
significantly
different
on
tap
than
in
bottle
the
foam
was
dark
wheat
in
color
and
dissapated
quickly
the
color
was
a
brown
burgandy
with
carmel
highlights
smell
was
of
a
dominate
yet
subtle
hops
aroma
with
hints
of
orange
peel
spices
and
licorice
taste
was
of
a
dominate
orange
hops
underlined
by
spices
like
licorice
anise
and
nutmeg
mouthfeel
mediumbodied
and
crisp
drinkability
not
too
bad
a
beer
for
the
holidays
due
to
the
spice
flavors
but
a
little
too
watered
down
for
my
taste
12
oz
bottle
from
sam
adams
winter
pack
pours
deep
mahogany
with
a
large
offwhite
head
nice
carbonation
aroma
is
caramel
malt
with
spicy
hops
in
the
background
medium
oily
body
flavor
is
spicy
hops
balanced
by
caramel
malt
and
some
brown
sugar
long
finish
becomes
dry
good
all
around
beer
dcould
drink
all
day
and
night
puts
me
right
in
the
christmas
mood
overall
good
beer
overall
another
solid
offering
from
sam
adams
not
my
favorite
beer
theyve
put
out
but
its
worth
a
shot
final
thoughts
disappointed
replace
this
with
fezziwig
and
sam
adams
with
have
some
pretty
decent
seasonals
drinkability
pretty
delicious
but
substatial
enough
to
encourage
savoring
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
color
almost
brown
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
smells
of
caramel
malts
and
a
faint
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
an
interesting
combination
of
hops
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
bock
drinkability
this
beer
is
ok
i
like
the
plain
ol
boston
lager
better
however
this
is
a
decent
little
change
probably
wouldnt
want
to
make
this
my
dominant
beer
but
at
times
and
in
moderation
is
ok
very
drinkable
cheap
and
widely
available
but
imho
not
really
worth
buying
too
one
dimensional
like
most
sa
brews
drank
this
lone
bottle
at
a
friends
house
tawny
amber
color
with
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
muted
bready
malt
aromas
with
a
pleasing
crispness
and
ample
caramel
malt
clean
malt
flavors
toasty
and
slightly
nutty
more
caramel
abounds
hop
bitterness
balances
the
maltiness
nicely
without
much
in
the
way
of
any
real
hop
flavor
crisp
dry
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
sturdy
beer
a
winter
classic
in
my
book
kind
of
a
beer
that
doesnt
seem
like
all
that
much
at
first
but
with
consideration
and
appreciation
for
the
subtle
is
quite
good
poured
with
a
giant
foamy
frothy
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
medium
amber
aroma
is
malt
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
is
like
nose
and
is
not
too
sweet
allowing
the
subtle
drier
roast
malt
to
show
a
bit
body
is
ok
and
caroboantion
is
good
finish
is
like
flavor
and
a
tad
on
the
short
side
easy
drinking
session
beer
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
i
would
like
to
continue
trying
more
seasonal
lagers
since
most
of
the
seasonal
beers
ive
tried
so
far
have
been
pale
ales
low
to
medium
bodied
moutfeel
with
average
carbonation
the
first
couple
drink
well
then
boredom
starts
to
set
in
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
medium
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
somewhat
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
adjuncts
and
caramel
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
not
bad
but
not
great
i
have
to
say
i
would
drink
it
again
pours
dark
brown
with
some
foam
smell
has
a
little
bit
of
dried
fruit
but
also
a
baked
breadlike
aroma
the
taste
is
solid
sweet
and
with
some
malty
notes
i
recall
this
being
better
in
years
past
medium
bodied
and
smooth
it
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
cold
months
i
think
the
sam
adams
has
beeter
offerings
however
d
nothing
offensive
and
wellbalanced
enjoyable
the
taste
is
ok
its
slightly
sweet
and
malty
but
has
that
wet
cardboard
taste
to
it
there
is
a
hint
of
spice
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
not
bad
a
little
fuller
than
i
would
have
expected
the
finish
lingers
tastes
like
wet
cardboard
db
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
fezziwig
which
i
had
last
night
this
one
definitely
has
a
more
pronounced
grainy
bready
feel
to
it
though
drinks
decently
but
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
often
d
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavors
are
all
fairly
balanced
but
just
a
little
dull
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
crisp
which
makes
it
a
refreshing
beer
md
light
to
medium
bodied
but
has
a
thick
mouthfeel
overall
its
fine
nothing
too
special
imo
overall
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
it
had
a
taste
that
could
easily
get
lost
in
the
shuffle
of
holiday
beers
there
was
nothing
that
made
this
beer
stand
out
i
cannot
see
myself
purchasing
another
6pck
if
this
was
ontap
at
a
bar
with
limited
options
i
would
probably
order
it
first
sip
you
know
its
a
sam
adams
it
possesses
that
familiar
sammy
a
taste
it
pours
a
great
thick
head
that
you
expect
from
the
boston
beer
company
smell
is
average
with
a
hint
of
something
found
in
a
maier
bock
however
the
taste
is
very
different
a
warm
fruity
collection
of
spices
hits
your
palette
at
the
perfect
moment
very
enjoyable
and
not
over
done
like
in
past
years
a
full
flavored
and
certainly
drinkable
winter
brew
bravo
samuel
adams
picked
up
the
sam
adams
winter
sampler
mostly
to
review
beers
ive
had
before
winter
lager
is
a
straightforward
amber
lager
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
want
something
more
than
a
pale
lager
but
not
too
heavy
this
could
workl
well
its
more
of
a
spiced
bock
than
anything
else
theres
lots
of
holiday
spices
its
right
in
your
face
but
not
overpowering
which
makes
it
easy
drinking
and
quite
tasty
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
and
chewy
with
a
nice
sharp
carbonation
decent
brew
but
entirely
too
malty
for
me
id
like
it
to
be
a
little
more
balanced
with
hops
as
my
favorite
bocks
are
but
good
for
the
price
ok
i
cant
get
with
this
brew
looks
great
in
the
glass
but
the
flavor
was
offputting
to
me
i
found
an
odd
sourness
to
the
taste
especially
the
finish
maybe
its
the
added
flavors
i
wasnt
digging
im
obviously
in
the
minority
but
this
beer
just
didnt
work
for
me
this
beer
is
simply
delicious
and
rates
very
high
on
my
list
of
favorite
brews
almost
all
of
the
samuel
adams
brand
is
good
to
excellent
and
this
is
no
exception
i
consider
this
to
be
a
great
beer
worthy
of
your
time
and
money
try
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
this
beer
pours
a
really
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
head
it
smells
like
the
regular
lager
with
a
bunch
of
spices
has
a
full
body
flavor
lots
of
spices
a
nice
strong
lager
taste
easy
to
drink
but
low
with
the
carbondation
overall
a
really
good
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
pretty
light
bodied
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
pretty
smooth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
a
good
offering
from
sa
cheers
d
an
enjoyable
winter
bock
not
filling
at
all
and
truly
leaves
you
wanting
more
maybe
that
aftertaste
is
what
does
it
i
would
certainly
have
this
as
a
sipping
beer
for
an
evening
final
notes
definitely
on
the
somewhat
lighter
side
when
it
comes
to
winter
beers
a
great
session
beer
and
one
to
pair
with
either
a
big
thanksgiving
or
christmas
dinner
drank
after
dinner
as
a
dessert
beer
or
paired
with
either
a
caramel
or
chocolate
dessert
the
abv
is
not
overkill
5
8
and
the
flavors
are
very
good
d
clean
balanced
taste
smooth
light
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
has
clean
tastes
and
is
a
good
change
of
pace
for
the
season
12
bottle
poured
into
shaker
glass
poured
a
darker
copper
color
with
decent
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
aroma
of
spices
and
malt
taste
of
malt
caramel
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
cinnamin
definitely
one
of
sas
better
brews
that
i
look
forward
to
getting
a
taste
of
every
winter
d
would
be
a
good
cross
over
beer
for
the
die
hard
american
macro
lager
types
d
i
for
some
reason
think
this
may
be
sam
adams
best
beer
i
used
to
think
it
could
be
sold
year
round
but
perhaps
with
all
the
spice
it
is
best
that
it
is
a
winter
beer
this
lager
pours
a
redtinged
amber
with
little
foam
there
also
appears
to
be
very
little
carbonation
the
taste
is
very
light
and
void
of
taste
for
a
beer
of
this
color
a
biscutty
maltiness
dominates
the
taste
with
faint
spices
in
the
finish
every
year
i
try
it
and
every
year
i
walk
away
mildly
disappointed
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
an
average
sized
off
white
head
head
recedes
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
little
to
no
lacing
behind
smell
is
malt
with
a
subtle
spiciness
to
it
taste
is
again
lots
of
malts
with
some
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
spice
as
well
not
sure
exactly
what
though
a
good
beer
but
overall
just
kind
of
average
which
certainly
isnt
a
bad
thing
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
though
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
of
these
clear
deep
amber
color
off
white
head
that
dissapears
quick
lots
of
carbonation
smells
of
spices
and
malt
good
smell
tastes
of
malts
spices
and
hops
good
taste
slight
bitter
aftertaste
not
bad
can
drink
2
or
3
of
these
in
a
row
noticed
on
the
label
this
year
that
its
in
color
and
states
that
it
is
a
malt
beverage
has
it
always
said
that
i
dont
remember
this
one
pours
a
dark
hickory
in
color
with
a
light
off
white
head
its
pretty
thin
in
consistency
the
smell
is
just
soso
it
smells
of
light
malt
slight
wheat
and
light
spices
the
taste
is
better
its
pretty
sweet
and
a
little
dry
it
has
moderate
maltiness
and
has
a
maple
like
sweetness
it
drinks
pretty
light
and
crisp
its
ok
nothing
special
and
is
easy
to
drink
although
i
dont
think
id
want
to
have
another
one
very
nice
looking
beer
its
amber
in
color
moderately
carbonated
definitely
smell
the
spices
coming
through
with
a
hint
of
pumpkin
not
overwhelming
on
the
hops
the
spices
and
pumpkin
aroma
continue
to
the
palate
has
a
medium
thickness
good
beer
d
a
decent
bock
that
is
widely
available
and
easy
to
drink
can
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
and
while
not
my
favorite
something
i
can
drink
at
thanksgiving
with
non
bas
and
we
can
all
enjoy
i
enjoyed
the
smell
and
would
have
it
again
this
is
an
interesting
one
the
flavors
are
really
not
all
that
palate
pleasing
and
im
not
crazy
about
it
but
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
and
all
in
all
its
not
a
bad
iteration
of
a
winter
lager
id
take
it
over
sabl
any
day
drinkability
this
one
is
very
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
i
could
have
these
one
after
the
other
with
no
problem
whatsoever
its
a
nice
winter
lager
but
i
wish
there
was
just
a
bit
more
oomph
to
it
maybe
some
more
spices
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
pours
a
nice
amber
with
small
white
head
aroma
of
spices
cinnamon
sweet
malts
caramel
taste
is
the
same
as
aroma
palate
is
crisp
good
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
spices
some
cinamon
with
some
slight
bitter
hoppiness
to
add
some
balance
overall
a
very
nice
winter
seasonal
d
another
great
seasonal
from
samuel
adams
looking
to
get
more
of
this
during
the
winter
nice
appearance
very
nice
smell
nice
blend
of
flavors
very
nice
mouthfeel
everything
about
this
fits
great
for
what
i
know
of
bocks
pretty
decent
i
would
recommend
this
to
others
d
good
brew
to
drink
with
a
holiday
meal
but
theres
just
a
lot
of
better
choices
other
than
this
around
nothing
too
special
though
definitly
not
worth
seeking
out
or
paying
a
lot
for
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
notched
at
apr
from
the
samuel
adams
winter
classics
mix
12
pack
pours
a
dirty
copper
color
with
very
little
head
aromas
of
caramel
spices
and
malt
taste
is
mostly
of
spices
with
some
caramel
and
malt
mixed
in
slight
bit
of
orange
peel
bite
to
it
this
beer
is
a
bit
thin
overall
its
an
alright
beer
that
fits
the
season
well
drinkability
although
it
is
tasty
i
didnt
find
this
one
to
be
extremely
drinkable
about
2
or
3
of
these
and
im
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
d
this
is
damn
good
im
shocked
but
i
shouldnt
be
definitely
a
suggestion
to
craft
enthusiasts
and
novices
alike
samuel
adams
has
always
been
a
solid
beer
up
until
now
why
wouldnt
i
enjoy
their
winter
offering
pours
a
mediumdark
red
with
a
fingers
worth
of
tan
head
smells
are
spices
up
front
maybe
slight
clove
and
cardamon
i
also
smell
some
sweet
malt
and
maybe
some
ginger
tastes
are
spices
at
the
front
same
as
the
nose
some
ginger
slight
clove
and
that
strange
green
apple
yeastiness
ive
been
picking
up
in
sam
adams
beers
lately
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
this
is
very
drinkable
poured
a
clear
brown
in
color
with
reddish
highlights
that
had
a
half
finger
of
head
and
left
some
good
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
seemed
to
have
a
good
spice
kick
like
cinnamon
allspice
nutmeg
and
brown
sugar
it
also
had
a
good
fruity
malty
aroma
with
slight
hop
character
the
taste
was
pretty
similar
with
fruity
malts
cinnamon
brown
sugar
accents
but
it
did
have
a
little
hop
flavor
on
the
backend
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
spice
and
slight
creamy
finish
it
drank
pretty
good
and
its
definitely
starting
to
feel
a
lot
like
christmas
after
drinking
some
of
this
brew
solid
back
brew
d
a
solid
beer
with
decently
distinctive
character
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
special
but
i
wasnt
disappointed
and
it
went
pretty
well
with
the
meal
i
would
have
liked
something
a
bit
richer
but
for
a
lager
i
really
cant
complain
d
a
very
pleasant
winter
brew
it
did
not
knock
my
socks
off
but
worth
trying
taste
thin
and
artificial
nondescript
maltiness
up
front
that
quite
bland
and
flavorless
but
not
super
sweet
in
the
middle
the
carbonation
becomes
more
prevalent
and
there
is
a
lifeless
ripe
fruit
flavor
with
a
banana
edge
and
faint
spices
finish
is
short
semisweet
and
spicy
as
a
side
note
i
hate
to
be
one
of
those
guys
who
complain
that
this
years
seasonal
isnt
as
good
as
last
years
seasonal
but
it
should
be
noted
that
the
formulation
of
the
winter
lager
has
changed
in
recent
years
at
one
time
this
was
a
super
malty
6
9
abv
warmer
i
hadnt
had
this
in
a
few
years
and
i
remembered
it
being
very
malty
and
sweet
and
perhaps
a
bit
more
subtle
with
the
spices
thats
not
to
say
that
it
used
to
be
better
because
this
is
very
good
on
its
own
terms
its
just
different
than
you
may
remember
if
you
havent
tried
this
in
a
while
i
still
recommend
it
d
very
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
though
that
may
not
be
all
that
positive
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
bite
to
this
one
but
didnt
get
it
this
was
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
darkerheavier
beers
though
i
seem
to
remember
it
having
more
bite
to
it
though
my
palate
was
young
very
drinkable
came
as
2
of
a
seasonal
12
packnow
i
have
to
see
if
they
sell
them
in
sixers
without
the
spices
this
might
be
a
great
summer
beer
with
them
its
just
odd
and
not
good
for
a
hot
day
or
a
cold
one
could
go
well
with
some
dessert
but
who
buys
a
beer
for
the
23
times
a
year
they
do
that
body
is
a
frothy
medium
that
evaporates
quick
could
easily
throw
these
back
but
why
medium
body
high
carbonation
mild
dryness
decent
drinking
although
the
combo
of
cinnamon
and
citrus
is
a
little
weird
pretty
average
overall
and
not
one
of
the
better
sa
beers
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
and
malt
undertones
surprising
that
this
is
a
winter
lager
as
its
fairly
light
and
drinkable
good
beer
di
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
its
pretty
good
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
will
be
very
satisfying
to
a
lot
of
people
that
like
this
kind
of
beer
d
drink
ability
is
relatively
high
as
this
is
a
very
safe
beer
its
well
balanced
and
delicious
but
quite
neutral
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
but
after
a
while
the
ginger
may
begin
to
pose
a
problem
no
hard
feelings
to
sam
adamsthey
produce
a
solid
line
but
this
one
is
lower
on
my
list
than
the
rest
it
is
an
interesting
brew
not
really
a
bock
but
what
else
woudl
you
call
it
drinkability
easy
fairly
heavy
carbonation
easy
drinking
brew
i
had
samuel
adams
winter
lager
in
a
bar
in
lexington
ky
and
sadly
it
was
the
best
thing
they
had
im
not
much
on
bocks
its
a
beer
style
that
is
kind
of
a
palate
cleanser
but
the
spices
came
through
just
enough
for
this
winter
lager
hit
the
spot
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
nothing
i
would
rave
about
though
the
flavors
are
very
balanced
and
unoffensive
i
dont
think
i
would
by
a
six
pack
of
this
but
i
dont
mind
the
2
that
they
throw
into
their
winter
variety
pack
this
beer
is
better
then
the
white
ale
thats
for
sure
121412
the
2012
version
of
this
beer
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
10
or
even
the
11
and
i
feel
the
difference
is
significant
enough
to
warrant
a
note
on
this
review
the
delicious
spicy
finish
is
mia
in
this
version
much
more
subtle
hops
are
more
prevalent
as
well
i
would
lower
my
previous
flavor
grade
from
4
on
the
10
to
a
3
on
this
version
the
main
thing
that
stuck
out
for
me
was
that
the
head
and
lacing
were
phenomenal
i
poured
the
perfect
pint
into
a
sam
adams
glass
myself
and
the
head
stayed
for
minutes
and
the
lacing
was
impressive
it
did
everything
it
was
supposed
to
pretty
well
but
unfortunately
personally
im
just
not
into
the
taste
seemed
almost
skunky
to
me
so
maybe
mine
was
just
old
but
it
didnt
go
down
easy
for
me
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
the
aftertaste
was
clean
and
malt
forward
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
overall
nothing
special
notes
out
of
the
sam
adams
winter
sampler
dfor
a
winter
beer
very
drinkable
more
of
session
beer
for
the
colder
time
of
year
i
guess
i
love
trying
seasonal
beers
i
had
this
one
at
a
bar
on
tap
the
color
is
good
looks
very
rich
the
taste
is
equally
rich
very
creamy
taste
it
is
a
beer
that
you
can
tell
is
one
brewed
for
christmas
time
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
as
it
is
very
very
sweet
pours
a
deep
ruby
burgundy
color
with
an
off
white
head
and
a
generous
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
cinnamon
and
a
little
hops
tastes
very
sweet
with
some
evening
out
by
the
mild
hops
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
and
good
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
drinkability
is
high
a
good
offering
from
sam
adams
light
and
drinkable
d
pretty
drinkable
beer
with
only
a
5
6
abv
although
it
does
have
a
nice
flavor
and
the
abv
isnt
high
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
23
of
these
in
a
sitting
before
i
became
sick
of
it
it
isnt
as
forward
on
the
flavors
as
i
recalled
this
makes
it
not
quite
as
good
as
old
fezziwig
in
my
opinion
as
a
winter
warmer
overall
this
is
a
a
solid
beer
overall
a
decent
brew
not
terribly
complex
or
interesting
worth
a
try
d
very
drinkable
and
widely
available
on
tap
as
a
seasonal
just
about
anywhere
overall
i
never
miss
sawl
when
it
hits
the
shelves
a
great
goto
winter
brew
its
always
a
hit
with
bcmers
when
i
take
some
to
a
mmafootball
watch
party
two
bummers
though
sa
why
did
you
change
the
label
guys
the
new
label
looks
like
spring
the
old
label
while
a
bit
boring
represented
the
cold
snowy
blustery
nights
of
winter
with
its
color
alone
the
other
bummer
is
that
one
pump
and
done
head
even
with
a
hardcore
pour
thats
all
you
get
still
i
dig
this
brew
well
balanced
but
rather
bland
a
nice
winter
beer
but
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
boston
lager
with
spices
added
to
it
d
heavy
but
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
session
however
reddish
brown
color
almost
flat
very
little
carbonation
head
disappeared
on
contact
very
sweet
and
malty
to
the
nose
with
hints
of
orange
zest
and
cinnamon
this
beer
is
spiced
with
cinamon
and
ginger
orange
peels
come
up
besides
that
it
is
very
malty
and
it
is
heavy
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
thick
zero
bubble
feel
minimal
hop
drying
and
presence
surpisingly
drinkable
though
solid
seasonal
beer
drinkability
quite
quaffable
flavor
is
not
overpowering
and
the
overall
experience
is
quite
refreshing
d
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
all
the
spices
work
really
well
not
a
bad
brew
overall
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
really
special
but
a
solid
brew
in
its
own
right
d
well
thankfully
i
only
have
one
more
since
i
only
sprung
for
the
half
case
but
it
really
hasnt
improved
much
from
last
year
still
mostly
lager
in
taste
and
if
i
wanted
a
lager
i
would
take
the
boston
since
it
at
least
carries
more
sweetness
drinks
a
bit
above
average
as
well
id
buy
again
good
for
holiday
festivities
to
be
sure
workin
my
way
through
the
winter
styles
pack
this
one
pours
a
nice
clear
dark
ruby
brown
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
light
roasted
malts
light
milk
chocolate
rye
bread
and
orange
zest
the
taste
is
very
similar
but
a
bit
spicier
newcomers
nutmeg
cinnamon
coriander
and
cola
add
some
complexity
to
the
flavor
but
seem
to
somewhat
overshadow
the
other
parts
or
rather
it
comes
in
phases
however
you
prefer
to
hear
it
everything
doesnt
mesh
perfectly
yeah
the
body
is
a
nice
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
semigrainy
feel
overall
a
very
nice
brew
one
that
could
use
some
tweaking
but
is
still
an
easy
and
enjoyable
drinker
notes
nothing
extreme
here
and
no
ingredients
that
dominate
the
nose
or
palate
just
a
balanced
but
shifting
brew
good
concept
of
a
winter
bock
drinkability
okay
i
think
this
really
isnt
a
bock
but
is
instead
more
like
an
attempt
at
a
watered
down
winter
warmer
the
spices
become
more
of
a
bitter
finish
as
the
beer
warms
up
i
dunno
maybe
it
a
bock
lager
after
all
but
the
spices
take
away
from
it
i
probably
wont
get
again
there
are
better
winter
beers
out
there
if
given
one
again
i
would
probably
pair
it
against
something
sweet
dwell
considering
there
are
no
negative
tastes
in
it
and
the
taste
doesnt
diminish
its
fairly
drinkable
not
sure
i
feel
the
need
to
buy
more
tho
overall
not
too
bad
but
doesnt
stand
out
much
among
the
others
in
the
holiday
pack
the
performance
is
just
not
sure
in
any
one
aspect
it
isnt
cohesive
it
feels
too
easy
i
wish
i
could
have
tasted
it
as
a
meatier
7
guy
as
ive
seen
it
mentioned
it
was
in
the
past
i
respect
sam
adams
but
im
afraid
theyve
gone
close
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
here
overall
not
a
bad
showing
by
sa
not
a
show
stopper
but
quite
quaffable
for
a
bock
the
mouthfeel
is
good
certainly
full
bodied
rich
well
balanced
and
full
of
flavor
a
perfect
winter
beer
especially
if
youre
not
particularly
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
or
porter
a
versatile
beer
and
extremely
drinkable
another
winter
favorite
why
is
this
a
winter
seasonal
i
think
i
could
and
would
drink
this
year
round
a
great
beer
that
im
sure
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
season
ive
had
this
about
two
years
ago
on
tap
i
remember
enjoying
it
i
never
was
a
big
fan
of
samuel
adams
this
is
one
of
their
first
brews
i
enjoyed
since
my
visit
to
the
brewery
i
learned
to
appreciate
and

d
good
seasonal
brew
easy
to
drink
well
worth
a
try
a
great
seasonal
from
sam
adams
and
a
solid
way
to
dive
into
the
winter
variety
pack
enjoy
this
one
and
savor
it
a
very
nice
winter
seasonal
that
captures
the
season
without
killing
you
with
gimmicks
other
than
maybe
brooklyn
bcs
my
favorite
beer
of
the
season
so
far
value
for
oncei
dont
mind
spending
8
or
9
bucks
on
a
sixer
of
samuel
adams
d
a
nice
beer
for
a
winter
evening
while
this
is
the
first
winter
lager
ive
ever
tried
i
would
have
to
say
that
to
me
this
beer
is
a
c
possibly
c
at
best
wouldnt
recommend
dthis
is
a
decently
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
drink
two
or
three
but
not
terribly
quickly
not
a
session
brew
for
me
but
a
nice
beer
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
over
a
conversation
recommendable
and
will
hopefully
buy
more
i
found
this
one
easy
to
drink
and
to
like
just
a
nice
pleasant
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
very
much
worth
trying
if
you
want
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
id
happily
have
more
of
this
drinkability
fairly
easy
to
drink
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
with
a
date
of
april
clipped
off
the
label
the
pour
is
a
nice
looking
amberred
with
about
a
finger
of
cream
colored
sliky
head
i
like
the
label
on
this
years
edition
better
than
the
snow
white
one
from
2009
the
aroma
is
wellspiced
with
nutmeg
and
malts
the
taste
also
has
an
enjoyable
nutmeg
toasted
maltiness
to
it
a
very
likeable
beer
drinkability
overall
this
brew
is
drinkable
but
not
above
average
i
havent
been
impressed
by
sam
adams
yet
they
make
better
beer
than
some
of
the
other
big
brewers
but
most
of
their
beers
lack
malt
character
and
aroma
a
sure
sign
they
are
cutting
corners
to
make
a
subpar
product
for
the
masses
a
nice
dessert
for
santa
d
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
impressive
watered
down
for
the
masses
i
wont
buy
again
and
i
love
sam
adams
its
redeeming
factor
is
that
it
has
that
signature
sam
adams
taste
and
thats
a
winner
smells
like
a
really
nice
sweet
malt
with
some
cinnamon
and
some
orange
on
the
back
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
malty
full
bodied
beer
its
like
a
wheat
beer
but
with
a
bunch
of
rich
malts
thrown
in
to
mix
with
the
wheat
the
malt
tastes
like
a
hint
of
chocolate
with
bready
and
toffeecarmael
like
malt
like
i
said
this
blends
very
well
with
that
cereal
malt
wheat
taste
that
samuel
adams
uses
in
some
of
their
beers
the
cinnamon
blends
in
so
well
as
well
the
hops
are
very
mild
but
mix
in
with
the
orange
corriander
like
finish
there
is
also
some
very
slight
ginger
in
there
as
well
to
mix
in
with
the
cinnamon
and
malts
used
which
reminds
you
of
christmas
in
a
way
i
guess
thats
why
they
call
it
winter
lager
and
now
give
it
its
new
more
festive
label
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
my
favorite
seasonal
from
samuel
adams
besides
the
noble
pils
overall
this
is
a
decent
dark
wheat
lager
but
nothing
overly
special
worth
a
try
d
the
drinkability
is
average
it
is
a
nice
beer
for
the
winter
months
being
analytical
towards
this
brew
is
all
fine
and
dandy
but
in
the
long
run
it
is
probably
best
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
your
beer
taste
buds
are
smarter
than
you
think
d
high
sas
best
seasonal
beer
imho
the
mouthfeel
is
great
full
bodied
malty
and
smooth
as
crystal
clear
water
this
is
the
first
of
the
winter
pack
this
year
and
so
far
i
am
impressed
this
is
a
very
good
american
take
on
a
classic
german
style
a
fair
brew
thats
subtly
flavored
goes
down
easy
d
definitely
drinkable
a
nice
easy
beer
for
lazy
winter
nights
overall
winter
lager
is
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
from
sam
adams
although
the
smell
is
average
at
best
the
beer
has
a
warming
taste
to
it
that
makes
it
a
good
pick
for
the
colder
months
its
not
overpowering
which
allows
you
to
have
as
many
as
you
want
or
can
handle
overall
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
beers
i
have
had
yet
its
the
2nd
of
the
winter
classic
i
have
tried
and
the
2nd
best
by
the
company
overall
i
have
had
only
behind
the
pumpkin
harvest
aleby
the
way
they
really
need
6packs
or
12packs
of
it
next
year
very
surprised
with
this
one
i
will
for
sure
be
drinking
this
a
few
more
times
this
winter
d
not
bad
goes
down
pretty
easy
hopefully
not
the
best
brew
of
the
package
d
smooth
and
malty
a
great
winter
warmer
with
a
very
reasonable
abv
with
a
good
flavor
punch
the
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
a
winter
lager
really
an
excellent
season
lager
nice
bock
no
the
best
but
could
be
a
first
one
of
this
style
medium
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinking
i
wouldnt
turn
this
beer
down
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
another
good
offering
from
the
boston
brewing
company
not
my
favorite
but
hey
i
cant
enjoy
every
style
equally
can
i
still
i
think
they
nailed
what
they
were
going
for
overall
i
liked
this
beer
its
definitely
meant
for
the
winter
season
and
is
an
appropriate
seasonal
by
sam
adams
if
you
are
like
me
and
want
to
try
all
of
the
sam
adams
varieties
give
this
one
a
shot
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
i
like
this
stuff
it
goes
well
with
roast
beef
or
even
a
burger
very
warming
feeling
bottle
into
pint
glass
sampled
4510
picture
perfect
pour
with
a
dark
brown
color
and
creamy
off
white
head
took
a
while
for
the
head
to
fall
and
a
nice
lacing
was
left
behind
as
it
did
the
nose
was
strong
with
a
molasses
malt
complimented
by
the
strong
flowery
hops
one
would
expect
from
sam
adams
notes
of
clove
and
some
fruit
also
sneak
in
there
the
flavor
pulls
all
these
aromas
together
with
the
initial
sweetness
being
cut
by
the
bitter
crisp
hop
finish
at
the
end
a
nice
warming
brew
which
would
benefit
a
little
more
with
a
little
less
hop
but
i
know
that
would
never
happen
with
this
brewer
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
much
better
when
served
closer
to
room
temp
also
matched
well
with
lots
of
different
foods
particularly
a
big
bowl
of
beef
stew
and
biscuits
probably
my
favorite
seasonal
from
them
and
one
that
my
wife
enjoys
quite
a
bit
as
well
i
was
first
introduced
to
winter
lagers
last
year
and
ive
yet
to
be
disappointed
sam
adams
isnt
my
favorite
but
its
still
a
good
beer
the
color
has
a
nice
dark
amber
tint
and
flavor
to
match
ill
be
trying
out
other
winter
lagers
for
my
kegerator
in
the
future
but
ill
be
keeping
this
one
on
a
short
list
i
liked
this
one
overall
and
will
probably
try
it
again
next
winter
not
something
ill
crave
in
the
summer
to
reminisce
about
the
winter
beers
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
red
mahogany
color
it
has
a
good
head
retention
with
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
malt
and
typical
christmas
beer
spices
the
taste
of
of
a
light
bodied
malty
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
spicy
dryness
as
a
lager
is
suites
well
making
this
a
easy
to
drink
but
full
flavored
beer
this
is
a
good
seasonal
beer
quite
good
all
around
easy
to
drink
right
now
its
a
nice
way
to
say
goodbye
to
the
winter
overall
impression
great
beer
i
had
this
beer
in
the
cellar
since
the
winter
of
2008
and
it
has
a
best
if
used
by
date
of
may
and
i
was
very
impressed
with
how
good
the
beer
is
even
after
having
it
in
the
cellar
for
close
to
a
year
and
a
half
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
it
looks
dark
in
the
glass
and
smells
wonderful
the
spices
brewed
into
it
really
add
a
lot
to
the
flavor
and
smell
this
is
like
guinness
in
the
way
that
you
cant
drink
a
lot
at
one
time
enjoy
the
winter
months
with
a
winter
lager
the
pour
is
dark
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
fades
fast
leaving
minimal
residue
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
with
a
minimal
about
of
hops
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
very
drinkable
brew
maybe
not
as
wintery
as
say
great
lakes
christmas
ale
but
still
a
solid
offering
from
sa
notes
good
winter
ale
that
is
warming
the
spices
combined
the
way
they
are
really
do
remind
me
of
winter
this
was
actually
about
what
i
was
expecting
after
trying
several
sam
adams
beers
i
have
grown
to
really
enjoy
their
offerings
their
boston
lager
just
blew
me
away
but
the
winter
lager
isnt
quite
as
exceptional
still
good
but
not
as
complex
and
quite
a
bit
weaker
still
a
good
beer
though
it
pours
a
little
browner
than
the
boston
lager
with
a
white
head
smell
is
malt
with
a
hint
of
spice
taste
is
the
same
but
i
think
its
still
a
bit
weak
for
a
winter
ale
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
id
have
more
if
i
had
them
if
you
like
a
decent
lager
its
fine
i
think
id
get
the
boston
lager
first
though
o
good
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
spices
could
be
a
bit
much
after
a
while
a
good
sam
adams
beer
i
would
recommend
trying
this
if
you
are
already
a
fan
of
sa
it
definitely
has
their
characteristics
i
wouldnt
say
it
is
a
stand
out
bock
beer
but
it
is
a
good
seasonal
offering
to
mix
up
your
every
day
beers
with
d
pretty
nice
the
spices
to
a
great
job
of
balancing
the
malty
sweetness
without
being
cloying
or
intrusive
the
alternating
finish
is
quite
attractive
i
would
like
this
beer
to
be
just
a
bit
bigger
a
bit
more
bock
even
maltier
and
more
heft
d
seriously
enough
cinnamon
dont
recall
it
being
this
bold
in
the
past
highly
accessible
winterized
bock
might
pair
well
with
some
carbheavy
german
food
d
good
beer
average
abv
id
drink
a
few
more
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
perfect
for
a
winter
day
has
a
nice
blend
of
spices
with
some
great
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
hints
actually
has
solid
drinkability
as
opposed
to
the
sam
adams
summer
which
to
me
becomes
a
little
overbearing
after
a
few
i
personally
prefer
a
little
less
spiceyness
in
my
lagers
ala
brooklyn
but
when
its
in
the
right
setting
there
are
few
winter
lagers
id
prefer
to
pour
thumbs
up
skål
serving
type
bottle
d
ok
but
pretty
weak
as
a
winter
offering
drink
only
if
nothing
else
available
d
very
drinkable
and
a
true
winter
beer
sessionable
its
warming
and
packs
a
good
kick
after
a
while
though
youd
have
to
drink
more
than
a
few
to
be
wasted
d
very
easy
to
drink
looking
forward
to
the
next
overall
a
great
beer
that
most
people
can
appreciate
especially
in
the
cold
midwest
winters
it
isnt
too
polarizing
to
put
people
off
but
rewards
the
ones
that
try
it
md
overall
another
good
brew
from
sam
adams
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
going
with
a
sweet
malt
taste
with
a
fair
amount
of
spices
not
overly
done
just
well
rounded
a
pretty
good
seasonal
that
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
and
share
the
beer
love
with
others
didnt
like
it
as
much
this
year
maybe
due
to
different
tastes
this
year
or
just
a
recipe
change
has
kind
of
a
artificial
hic
fruit
punch
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
weak
and
prickly
seems
unbalanced
still
not
a
bad
beer
the
spice
and
bready
malts
are
nice
this
winter
lager
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
sam
adams
winter
sampler
i
had
one
of
these
cold
and
one
that
was
just
cool
obviously
the
one
that
was
cold
didnt
match
up
to
the
cool
one
at
all
the
cool
one
really
brought
out
the
flavors
and
drinkability
this
was
one
of
the
first
good
beers
i
had
and
i
must
say
after
learning
how
to
appreciate
beer
properly
this
brew
is
so
much
better
d
can
think
of
others
i
would
session
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
good
taste
and
very
drinkable
i
think
this
is
one
of
their
better
seasonals
note
good
taste
not
overpowering
and
easy
to
drink
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
for
the
winter
but
theres
better
stuff
out
there
for
the
cold
personally
i
think
any
beer
that
is
emblazoned
with
the
winter
title
should
be
stronger
and
richer
it
feels
like
it
has
been
dumbed
down
to
appease
simpler
tastes
overall
better
than
i
expected
but
not
quite
good
enough
for
a
regular
drink
ill
be
looking
forward
to
my
summer
ale
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
nice
full
flavored
lager
that
makes
a
great
session
beer
on
those
cold
new
england
nights
you
have
redeemed
yourself
from
the
cherry
wheat
d
glorious
beer
that
actually
has
flavor
but
doesnt
feel
like
your
drinking
a
protein
shake
i
can
drink
6
or
8
and
not
wake
up
feeling
terrible
really
one
of
the
best
pound
for
pound
readily
available
beers
d
i
generally
dont
classify
winter
beers
as
exceedingly
drinkable
but
this
one
is
fairly
sessionable
as
far
as
winter
beers
go
d
the
spices
limit
drinkability
for
me
as
they
wear
on
the
palate
a
little
bit
not
all
that
interesting
but
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
a
few
bottles
on
a
cold
night
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
rich
holiday
beer
nice
to
enjoy
with
a
good
meal
good
carbonation
feels
great
on
the
palate
review
from
notes
taken
on
12609
drinkability
a
little
heavy
but
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
in
the
beer
good
but
not
great
the
tastemouthfeel
is
thinner
than
youd
expect
some
buttery
character
simple
malts
with
some
balancing
hops
all
subdued
and
watery
to
be
honest
some
hints
of
spice
that
dont
counter
the
buttery
watery
diluted
character
in
this
mess
of
underwhelming
boringness
masquerading
as
a
beer
with
some
flavor
cheers
decent
wellbalanced
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
i
did
enjoy
it
but
its
mostly
average
d
oh
yes
easy
to
repeat
d
easy
drinking
here
matches
perfectly
with
most
winter
holiday
meals
and
especially
desserts
like
pumpkin
pie
12oz
bottle
pours
reddishamber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
light
aroma
some
caramel
light
spice
flavor
is
caramel
malts
spice
slightly
sweet
decent
mouthfeel
not
too
carbonated
a
fair
winter
brew
especially
when
considering
the
price
drinkability
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
beer
to
have
with
dinner
or
as
something
to
drink
while
engaged
in
chatting
with
friends
it
has
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
but
it
not
so
complex
as
to
demand
your
full
attention
it
would
be
interesting
to
have
34
of
these
of
an
evening
to
see
if
the
flavors
grow
on
one
while
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
one
of
these
again
i
also
wont
make
any
special
effort
to
avoid
it
this
is
a
good
workmanlike
beer
and
a
good
value
for
the
money
one
of
the
strengths
of
this
beer
is
that
the
spices
are
subdued
and
enrich
the
flavor
without
taking
it
over
d
this
is
a
tasty
refreshing
lager
that
provides
exactly
what
it
advertises
cinnamon
ginger
orange
peel
i
think
it
could
honestly
do
without
the
orange
peel
but
either
way
its
very
easy
to
drink
a
sixer
will
definitely
anticipate
this
beer
for
next
winter
md
lightbodied
lively
carbonation
no
lingering
effects
very
drinkable
refreshing
alternative
to
heavier
winter
ales
way
way
drinkable
it
would
be
easy
to
overdo
it
i
could
have
finished
a
6pack
in
a
snap
if
it
didnt
finish
me
first
next
ill
reach
for
a
really
great
homebrew
dit
is
what
it
is
would
this
be
my
choice
if
you
gave
me
options
for
the
style
no
but
a
solid
seasonal
that
is
often
the
best
choice
at
some
restaurants
and
bars
who
do
not
carry
lots
of
choices
i
will
look
fwd
to
this
seasonal
in
years
to
come
one
of
the
better
seasonal
offerings
by
bbcsa
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
only
spiced
brew
i
have
really
really
enjoyed
in
a
sessionable
context
d
drinkable
i
think
that
the
brewery
went
just
a
tad
on
the
conservative
side
for
a
winter
brew
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
but
just
a
bit
substantially
thicker
than
other
traditional
lagers
good
for
the
style
coats
the
mouth
very
well
and
lingers
for
just
a
few
seconds
the
drinkability
is
decent
i
honestly
dont
see
myself
having
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
for
a
night
but
its
still
very
pleasing
not
a
bad
seasonal
by
the
bbc
overall
i
am
not
very
impressed
with
this
offering
from
sam
adams
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
d
a
nice
beer
that
has
some
interesting
stuff
going
on
but
isnt
too
overthetop
man
if
i
could
just
find
someone
who
love
the
coastal
wheat
and
cranberry
lambic
but
hates
the
winter
lager
trade
if
im
in
the
airport
tomorrow
in
newark
and
this
is
the
best
thing
they
have
available
for
8
ill
probably
get
it
as
long
as
it
comes
with
a
1
shot
not
too
much
to
change
about
this
one
this
is
probably
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
beer
its
very
tasty
ontap
and
from
the
bottle
winter
lager
brings
a
fairly
strong
taste
but
it
isnt
overwhelming
or
too
bitter
as
with
most
sam
adams
beers
this
beer
as
a
beautiful
dark
color
give
this
beer
a
try
its
something
different
for
the
winter
season
pours
forth
a
darker
amber
color
smells
of
caramel
and
cinnamon
bit
harder
to
discern
the
smells
tonight
with
a
clogged
nose
taste
of
caramel
in
the
tongue
always
an
enjoyable
drink
on
a
cold
day
for
me
feels
rather
water
no
real
bit
to
it
i
could
sit
down
on
a
cold
winter
day
in
front
of
a
fire
place
and
easily
polish
of
a
few
without
even
noticing
decent
easy
drinker
when
you
are
at
an
office
party
without
better
alternatives
pours
dark
amber
and
clear
in
appearance
aroma
is
of
malt
some
caramel
and
a
touch
of
allspice
taste
is
pleasantly
sweet
with
some
hops
for
balance
the
spices
are
there
but
stay
in
the
background
which
is
a
good
thing
i
think
im
not
detecting
any
wheat
goodness
but
thats
okay
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
finishes
clean
i
think
ill
have
another
i
bought
a
case
to
share
with
familyfriends
on
christmas
eve
and
its
a
very
approachable
micro
brew
for
guests
to
try
not
the
greatest
just
tasty
and
reasonably
priced
due
to
the
sweetness
samuel
adams
winter
lager
went
very
well
with
christmas
cookies
however
when
it
was
gone
there
was
no
evidence
left
behind
on
glass
or
palate
and
not
much
to
remember
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brownish
amber
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
quickly
the
aromas
are
bready
and
some
hints
of
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
sweet
crystal
malt
up
front
up
front
with
enough
spice
and
character
to
balance
the
spices
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
are
a
nice
added
touch
as
well
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
warmth
does
it
some
good
not
a
typical
bock
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
very
easy
to
drink
but
probably
not
for
everyone
when
i
poured
into
my
glass
it
had
about
a
12
inch
head
that
disappeared
into
a
nice
thin
white
lace
it
smells
la
little
strong
of
hops
but
not
to
overpowering
has
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
l
little
bitter
but
nicethats
my
thought
a
very
nice
mouth
feel
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
and
would
recommend
it
to
anybody
who
likes
a
hearty
lager
i
also
think
this
beer
fits
this
time
of
year
its
cold
and
it
will
warm
you
up
d
this
was
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
which
i
enjoyed
for
the
most
part
this
was
until
the
beer
got
a
little
warmer
the
alcohol
jumped
out
a
little
more
making
the
beer
harder
to
swallow
overall
though
i
would
drink
this
again
but
as
something
more
than
just
a
sipper
d
has
a
nice
taste
low
abv
can
drink
plenty
of
these
drinkability
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
seasonal
offering
from
sam
adams
its
been
on
my
radar
for
a
while
now
and
it
will
continue
to
be
on
my
radar
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
with
a
half
finger
off
white
head
aroma
is
slight
with
caramel
maltiness
and
faint
hops
flavor
follows
suit
with
malty
sweetness
bread
and
just
the
slightest
detection
of
brewing
spices
light
to
medium
bodied
not
a
lot
of
depth
or
interest
but
decent
for
sure
i
really
like
this
beer
i
buy
cases
whenever
i
can
also
like
the
slight
cinnamon
flavor
that
the
beer
hasmust
say
its
really
nice
i
find
the
beer
to
be
smooth
with
nice
lacing
and
a
great
smell
its
a
really
nice
all
around
beer
for
the
cold
season
d
pretty
easy
drinking
winter
style
beer
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
orange
flavors
for
my
liking
definitely
not
your
typical
bock
d
simple
to
pick
up
and
drink
a
few
poured
into
a
stein
this
brew
has
a
nice
reddishbrown
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
is
about
2
fingers
and
settles
into
a
nice
cap
the
aroma
is
of
slightly
toasted
malts
hints
of
some
seasonal
spices
of
clove
and
prunes
there
is
also
a
mild
doughy
smell
the
taste
is
of
faint
spices
and
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
more
on
the
stout
side
of
a
winter
ale
with
much
less
spice
to
my
liking
this
is
an
all
around
solid
brew
not
much
i
dont
like
it
is
not
over
the
top
great
but
wonderful
to
bring
to
a
holiday
party
to
pass
and
not
offend
anyone
overallnotes
good
beer
from
boston
brewing
co
and
being
my
first
bock
makes
me
want
to
find
some
more
the
sweetness
is
a
major
plus
cheers
d
i
could
get
fed
up
on
this
bad
daddy
these
go
down
me
just
way
too
easily

some
noble

light

wheaty
with
some

sweetness
a
little
bit
of

in

not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
but
its
fairly
drinkable
anyhoo
finishes
decent
a
little
unusual
flavors
in
there
similar
at
times
to
anchors
christmas
you
start
to
think
there
is
like
nutmeg
or
celery
in
there
along
with
a
dash
of
cinnamon
and
other
holiday
type
adjuncts
that
are
lively
wheat
body
gives
it
a
lighter
liveliness
than
a
lot
of
winter
seasonals
pours
with
a
good
thick
head
and
has
a
pleasant
and
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
d
good
beer
for
a
cold
day
drinkability
is
above
average
this
is
a
reasonable
winter
beer
overall
had
this
on
tap
many
times
and
in
bottle
but
this
review
is
for
on
tap
has
a
thick
foamy
slightly
off
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
quite
a
bit
faintly
smells
sweet
and
spicy
has
a
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
bock
style
beer
i
like
it
the
feel
is
good
syrupy
as
it
goes
down
drinkability
is
excellent
because
this
was
is
tasty
and
not
too
strong
highly
recommended
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
big

head
with
a
dark
amber
body
laced
pretty
good
roasted
malt
and
the
slightest
hint
of
orange
in
the
finish
very
mild
flavored
taste
this
beer
seems
weaker
to
me
than
in
prior
years
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
d
good
brew
wish
it
was
available
longer
in
the
season
gets
me
in
the
christmas
spirit
clear
reddish
copper
with
no
head
smells
appropriately
seasonal
cherries
cinnamon
cloves
taste
is
cherry
wood
a
bit
of
cinnamon
in
the
aftertaste
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
but
a
bit
thin
drinkability
is
very
good
not
a
challenging
beer
at
all
it
passes
mostly
unnoticed
maybe
a
good
trainer
beer
but
i
like
the
boston
lager
much
better
d
this
beer
tastes
like
christmas
it
is
really
good
and
goes
down
easily
i
think
that
i
will
get
it
in
my
kegerator
next
year
dark
amber
in
color
thin
ring
of
eggshell
foam
no
real
head
or
retention
the
smell
is
maily
malt
with
some
faint
indistinguishable
spices
i
am
guessing
nutmeg
or
other
christmas
flavors
but
pretty
tough
to
tell
no
real
overpowering
flavors
good
balance
between
malty
sweetness
and
some
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
low
carbonation
keep
it
smooth
slightly
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
good
but
not
great
nothing
really
helps
it
to
stand
out
lighter
body
as
expected
from
a
lager
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
heavy
at
all
and
the
5
8
abv
keeps
it
to
sessionable
levels
in
general
e
very
well
balanced
beer
and
rather
aleish
for
a
lager
which
for
me
is
a
good
thing
dark
amber
pour
hinting
of
ruby
the
malt
dominated
the
spices
there
was
an
earthy
hops
aroma
but
it
was
fairly
weak
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
are
there
in
weak
amounts
its
malty
sweet
and
the
spices
are
hinting
its
tough
to
pick
out
a
single
one
this
is
actually
a
good
thing
no
single
flavor
overpowering
another
nice
and
balanced
ive
always
enjoyed
this
but
i
was
more
fond
of
it
this
year
than
previous
years
maybe
its
my
fancy
pants
sam
adams
glass
i
just
got
d
amazingly
drinkable
i
had
to
slow
myself
down
as
i
could
hardly
contain
myself
d
overall
a
nice
drinkable
brew
my
favorite
of
the
sam
adams
catalog
of
beersoctoberfest
close
second
finally
a
winter
beer
that
is
more
interested
in
being
medium
and
drinkable
rather
than
overpowering
notes
my
perception
of
this
beer
is
about
the
same
as
my
perception
of
most
sam
adams
beers
not
exactly
a
stellar
brew
yet
never
a
bad
choice
either
not
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
or
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
but
a
decent
beer
nevertheless
a
solid
winter
beer
and
very
drinkable
during
the
holiday
season
overall
an
enjoyable
winter
brew
but
not
quite
the
bock
i
was
expecting
overall
great
beer
and
another
solid
attempt
by
sam
adams
although
i
think
some
of
my
local
breweries
do
it
better
i
highly
recommend
this
to
you
and
yours
as
always
cheers
i
like
this
beer
because
you
have
to
wait
for
it
every
year
to
be
released
it
kind
of
lets
me
know
christmas
is
coming
and
all
is
right
with
the
world
i
know
thats
far
fetched
but
it
really
is
a
great
beer
what
i
like
most
about
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
although
you
can
taste
the
extra
spices
they
dont
overpower
the
drinkability
so
with
that
said
happy
holidays
d
a
nice
beer
a
real
winter
beer
in
sweden
this
is
marketed
as
a
xmas
beer
but
this
doesnt
go
to
well
with
xmas
food
at
least
not
swedish
this
is
a
really
nice
winter
beer
but
not
the
best
xmas
beer
d
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
perfect
for
the
winter
season
drinkability
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
heavy
enough
to
satisfy
yet
not
so
heavy
that
it
becomes
a
chore
to
drink
the
beer
would
definitely
get
a
12pack
next
time
around
about
a
half
an
inch
head
of
loose
tan
foam
which
swiftly
disperses
to
a
thin
surface
layering
minimal
lacing
at
best
clear
red
amber
liquid
with
more
orange
zinc
hue
around
the
rims
easily
transparent
whiff
of
nutmeg
and
ginger
in
the
nose
toasted
cocoa
and
caramel
close
to
white
pepper
at
times
moderate
apricot
apple
fruit
and
close
to
zero
citrus
presence
its
really
all
over
the
place
sometimes
smells
like
dr
pepper
lightbodied
with
sufficient
carbonation
to
churn
it
up
into
a
larger
presence
more
metallic
and
herbaceous
here
with
the
malts
caramel
and
molasses
a
diminished
force
ginger
cinnamon
nutmeg
remains
strong
contributes
to
its
overall
dryness
regrettably
it
is
a
touch
boring
and
suggests
more
personality
than
it
delivers
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
d
a
good
winter
seasonal
but
one
of
the
weaker
seasonals
from
saumel
adams
in
terms
of
their
christmas
offerings
id
stop
at
two
pints
too
the
whole
beer
is
good
but
overall
a
bit
cloying
with
extended
consumption
good
breakfast
beer
drinkability
overally
this
beer
actually
was
not
to
bad
at
all
nothing
i
personally
would
regularly
probably
seek
out
as
i
am
not
hugely
into
a
lot
of
winter
lagers
but
it
exceded
my
expectations
so
it
is
one
i
would
give
another
look
overall
just
a
very
nice
rich
ale
that
is
not
bad
if
you
just
want
one
easy
drinking
beer
at
the
local
pub
or
by
the
tv
the
taste
is
really
rich
the
carmel
and
other
spiced
malts
hit
the
palate
first
notes
of
ginger
playing
at
the
tongue
throughout
an
excellent
offering
from
sa
d
this
is
a
one
off
beer
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
due
to
the
strong
ginger
flavor
but
it
is
tasty
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
winter
spice
beer
beer
is
full
bodied
with
an
interesting
sweetness
there
is
a
cereal
like
aftertaste
that
gets
stronger
the
more
you
drink
low
bitterness
although
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
present
there
is
also
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
midpalate
drinkability
high
mouthfeel
is
ok
overall
this
beer
is
kind
of
unremarkable
i
expected
something
better
than
this
but
it
kinda
let
me
down
boston
lager
is
a
good
deal
better
overall
a
good
beer
out
of
those
that
are
readily
available
like
others
from
sam
adams
though
better
beers
out
there
for
the
money
but
they
are
harder
to
find
looks
nice
clear
and
coppery
with
a
frothy
tan
head
not
too
much
going
on
with
the
smell
first
taste
is
all
smoky
malt
going
into
some
bitter
and
spice
what
really
is
distracting
from
this
bottle
is
a
metallic
bent
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
thin
and
im
left
remembering
how
this
beer
was
a
bit
bolder
in
years
past
i
may
have
sampled
from
an
off
batch
though
d
a
good
winter
lager
very
good
in
terms
of
balance
good
stuff
for
the
pricestyle
this
brew
is
very
good
a
yearly
tradition
for
me
and
my
fellow
beer
drinkers
and
rightfully
so
drinkability
this
has
a
bit
more
flavor
than
samuel
adams
boston
lager
and
was
definitely
enjoyable
the
finish
was
really
great
and
a
little
less
carbonation
would
have
helped
with
drinkability
but
this
beer
would
go
incredible
well
with
thanksgiving
dinner
i
would
buy
this
again
note
in
all
fairness
this
is
not
a
type
of
beer
i
usually
drink
my
ratings
are
on
the
poor
side
but
theyre
definitely
skewed
due
to
my
preference
of
stouts
and
porters
maybe
a
great
beer
if
you
enjoy
this
style
worth
a
try
certainly
not
a
favorite
of
mine
d
very
easy
to
drink
manageable
abv
certainly
is
a
winter
warmer
to
me
as
the
malty
notes
go
well
against
a
cold
iowa
night
f
finishes
a
little
sweet
still
a
little
drier
would
make
it
even
nicer
the
dark
malt
and
syrupy
flavor
sticks
around
pun
intended
as
it
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
mouth
and
the
tongue
for
a
short
while
leaving
the
sticky
flavor
a
slight
bitterness
and
spicy
earthy
hop
flavor
remain
at
the
finish
but
dont
get
stronger
at
all
medium
bodied
and
slightly
syrupy
leads
to
a
quick
and
smooth
drink
though
not
the
most
exciting
d
good
id
order
another
and
maybe
6
more
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
got
this
on
tap
but
ive
had
it
on
bottle
before
its
still
a
great
beer
all
around
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkabilityoverall
its
certainly
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
but
its
just
not
that
interesting
does
not
compare
favorably
to
southern
tiers
old
man
winter
which
id
had
the
day
before
theres
nothing
at
all
unpleasant
about
it
its
just
tame
taste
definitely
some
cinnamon
little
bit
of
ginger
as
well
pretty
tasty
but
its
nothing
to
go
too
crazy
over
this
beer
was
especially
impressive
possibly
due
to
my
previous
encounters
with
samuel
adams
personal
preferences
the
beer
is
a
rich
dark
amber
color
emitting
scents
of
various
spices
from
the
very
first
pour
i
enjoyed
its
crisp
notes
and
spiced
finish
while
i
tend
to
enjoy
most
dark
wheat
beers
i
did
particularly
enjoy
this
seasonal
brew
drinkability
pretty
good
beer
mouth
is
light
on
tongue
with
some
bitterness
carbonation
average
a
good
equal
malt
and
bitterness
drink
ive
had
this
for
an
evening
and
its
a
good
session
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
copperamber
hue
with
a
tan
head
that
leaves
a
very
nice
lacing
smells
slightly
of
hops
and
a
nice
bouquet
of
other
spices
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
taste
is
very
good
malty
but
with
many
spices
cinnamon
ginger
seem
to
be
prominent
as
well
as
fruits
such
as
berries
and
even
some
caramel
feels
slightly
more
bodied
than
i
was
expecting
and
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
goes
down
smooth
and
is
a
reasonably
priced
holiday
favourite
this
is
a
wellmade
brew
and
a
good
seasonal
choice
one
or
two
is
all
i
would
want
i
dont
find
bocks
to
be
imminently
quaffable
i
got
bored
with
it
by
halfway
through
the
second
one
a
cleaner
finish
would
have
made
this
a
bit
easier
to
drink
5
8
is
a
little
sneaky
too
overall
a
decent
brew
yet
pretty
standard
has
some
interesting
flavors
and
is
actually
quite
refreshing
mouthfeel
drinkability
are
ok
though
i
certainly
wont
be
buying
any
6
or
12
packs
of
this
this
year
its
just
amazing
to
me
that
they
are
calling
this
the
same
name
as
previous
years
beer
in
the
past
ive
bought
multiple
12
packs
of
the
sa
winter
lager
those
were
a
rich
malty
slightly
spiced
lagers
great
stuff
this
was
thin
pale
and
overspiced
i
thought
quite
disappointing
especially
given
my
expectations
from
the
past
on
tap
at
a
bar
on
boylston
street
served
in
a
pint
glass
dark
reddish
brown
color
faint
head
and
lacing
smells
a
bit
like
cinnamon
and
pine
taste
was
good
but
not
great
bit
of
caramel
and
toasted
nuts
noticed
pretty
malty
beer
the
body
was
a
bit
on
the
light
side
for
a
winter
beer
fairly
simple
to
drink
not
a
beer
to
ponder
easy
beer
to
have
with
food
or
by
itself
another
crowd
pleaser
from
sa
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
just
reminds
me
of
a
toneddown
version
of
their
old
fezziwig
ale
which
is
much
better
than
this
d
goes
down
easy
but
for
me
there
is
something
in
the
spices
that
doesnt
do
it
for
me
where
did
the
winter
lager
that
i
had
from
sam
adams
two
years
ago
go
i
didnt
get
to
try
it
last
year
but
i
remember
trying
it
a
couple
years
ago
and
it
being
a
little
heartier
and
more
winterlike
than
it
currently
is
sams
needs
to
rework
this
beer
its
very
good
but
simply
too
light
and
boring
had
on
tap
at
chilis
it
came
in
chilled
mug
a
redbrown
color
with
a
very
small
head
and
thin
lacing
had
a
malty
smell
with
some
citrus
the
taste
was
sweet
malts
and
biscuits
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
taste
it
had
some
nice
hops
in
the
finishoverall
a
typically
good
sam
adams
brew
not
great
but
drinkableenjoyable
as
most
boston
beers
co
are
d
the
beer
is
light
enough
to
have
all
night
but
the
flavor
is
too
light
and
offputting
to
make
you
want
to
do
that
pours
a
red
brown
without
much
head
the
head
that
is
there
is
sticking
around
for
a
while
the
smell
is
primarily
of
sweet
malt
with
a
slightly
acidic
smell
possibly
citrus
tasty
malt
forward
taste
slightly
sweet
its
nothing
special
but
i
kind
of
like
it
a
good
easy
drinker
with
some
flavor
but
i
wont
break
the
bank
on
it
d
i
love
it
cheers
and
enjoy
d
good
winter
bock
with
low
abv
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
nothing
terrible
but
nothing
spectacular
average
is
the
best
word
carbonation
is
typical
sam
adams
but
it
works
instead
of
being
a
heavy
winter
warmer
style
of
beer
its
a
crisp
refreshing
bockstyle
with
spices
its
very
light
bodied
and
would
be
a
great
session
beer
for
a
cold
saturday
evening
unless
you
want
something
with
more
alcohol
overall
this
may
be
one
of
the
better
spiced
winter
beers
ive
had
with
that
said
it
lacks
the
body
and
intense
malt
presence
i
enjoy
in
my
bocks
and
winter
beers
this
is
much
closer
to
a
spiced
marzen
than
a
bock
not
something
i
would
buy
regularly
but
would
be
happy
to
drink
if
offered
overall
for
a
bock
or
a
lager
this
beer
is
light
bodied
on
the
bottle
it
says
a
dark
wheat
lager
definitely
nothing
to
crazy
only
picked
it
up
cuz
the
store
didnt
have
sht
not
to
bummed
but
wish
i
had
something
different
very
nice
clear
reddish
mahogany
color
1
finger
head
that
left
an
average
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
with
roasted
malt
and
cinnamon
maybe
a
little
hoppieness
in
there
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
malt
orange
cinnamin
and
balanced
out
with
some
hops
medium
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
if
i
could
change
this
beer
id
make
it
more
full
flavored
and
a
little
more
heavy
that
being
said
this
beer
more
then
likely
wont
blow
any
minds
its
just
a
solid
sessionable
seasonal
lager
that
balances
many
flavors
together
d
a
very
nice
winter
beer
that
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
easily
overall
id
say
that
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
winter
seasonal
im
pretty
sure
its
to
style
although
i
havent
had
too
many
bocks
very
sessionable
in
a
winteresque
way
d
i
anticipated
the
taste
being
a
little
richerheartier
than
it
actually
is
the
spices
kind
of
give
this
beer
a
weird
aftertaste
that
makes
it
a
little
difficult
to
put
down
easily
d
like
the
creamy
stout
this
beer
appeals
to
a
larger
crowd
and
it
seems
to
fit
the
bill
personally
when
i
have
a
bock
i
want
something
full
bodied
and
heavy
especially
during
the
winter
i
understand
what
sam
adams
is
putting
out
but
this
beer
seems
more
like
a
fallspring
beer
not
a
winter
beer
or
maybe
even
a
bock
for
that
matter
that
said
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
some
winter
ales
are
over
the
top
with
the
nutmeg
and
spice
but
not
this
one
just
a
good
solid
well
balanced
beer
and
something
i
look
forward
to
each
winter
because
of
the
good
pricing
in
12
packs
this
is
my
goto
beer
this
time
of
year
d
a
little
to
sweet
to
pound
these
but
can
drink
more
than
one
easily
overall
very
drinkable
middleoftheroad
winter
offering
excellent
drinkability
the
earthiness
is
just
a
bit
trying
by
the
end
but
still
nicely
flavorful
and
well
balanced
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
good
bear
to
sit
down
on
a
winter
night
and
sip
away
at
great
taste
i
highly
recommend
it
moreys
bottom
line
im
not
big
on
lagers
or
sam
adams
for
that
matter
but
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
no
questions
asked
fairly
unique
too
i
feel
like
they
achieved
exactly
what
they
were
aiming
for
with
this
one
d
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
but
not
really
a
session
beer
good
beer
to
drink
with
heavier
food
such
as
steaks
and
ribs
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
which
is
my
wintertime
goto
dinner
beer
overall
doesnt
scream
winter
to
me
or
even
particularly
lager
it
warms
you
up
sure
but
it
is
too
light
in
my
honest
opinion
i
wish
this
beer
was
available
year
round
d
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
and
one
that
you
could
easily
have
several
of
in
a
session
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
bocks
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
fairly
enjoyable
and
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
one
i
have
to
say
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
from
all
that
i
have
heard
unfortunately
it
really
was
nothing
special
it
really
did
not
have
a
ton
of
flavor
and
tasted
just
ok
didnt
hate
it
but
for
the
price
there
are
way
better
choices
than
sams
winter
drinkability
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
selections
from
sa
i
will
definitely
turn
to
this
beer
at
least
one
more
time
this
season
and
will
look
forward
to
it
in
winters
to
come
nice
medium
body
and
pleasent
lingering
after
taste
would
defenatly
reach
fo
another
smooth
and
drinkable
had
another
one
to
taste
for
sure
nicely
carbonated
with
a
solid
body
to
it
on
a
colder
day
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
for
a
while
the
only
real
downfall
is
the
fact
that
only
2
came
inside
the
winter
variety
pack
d
very
high
one
of
the
best
tasting
winter
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
this
beer
is
full
flavored
and
goes
down
nicely
only
downfall
is
its
a
seasonal
beer
d
pretty
good
it
isnt
really
a
showstopper
but
its
widely
available
and
not
bad
at
all
drinakblity
is
great
this
would
make
a
very
nice
session
beer
as
it
is
quite
flavorful
and
goes
down
smooth
i
look
forward
to
having
many
more
of
these
in
the
coming
cold
winter
months
d
i
really
like
this
beer
as
i
noted
above
the
flavors
could
use
just
a
little
more
balance
but
overall
its
tasty
and
very
drinkable
when
i
go
out
to
restaurants
this
time
of
year
that
dont
have
anything
special
on
tap
this
is
almost
always
what
i
get
this
would
be
good
to
session
as
well
drinkability
pleasant
to
drink
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
slight
spice
is
no
longer
noticeable
and
the
hops
finish
very
well
cheers
an
old
friend
of
mine
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
started
years
ago
mediocre
example
of
the
style
malty
and
spicy
with
little
hop
presence
the
thing
i
did
appreciate
about
this
beer
was
the
alcohol
bite
which
warms
you
on
those
cold
winter
nights
and
also
the
spice
character
nutmeg
vanilla
extract
and
cinnamon
were
all
present
still
not
very
tasty
close
to
a
cola
feel
and
a
bitterness
from
spice
in
the
finish
that
is
mildly
unpleasant
d
very
nice
drinker
for
cooler
to
colder
days
and
nights
drinkability
nice
hearty
winter
lager
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
so
you
cant
forget
the
upcoming
festivities
of
course
this
isnt
really
a
bock
a
bock
with
wheat
and
spices
nein
drinkabiltiy
is
good
one
of
the
better
seasonal
sa
beers
drinkability
very
much
so
i
cant
wait
for
it
to
get
a
bit
cooler
outside
so
i
can
sit
out
in
the
cool
autumn
air
with
a
jacket
and
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
the
porch
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
saw
this
today
and
couldnt
help
myself
to
having
one
tonight
i
cant
wait
for
the
other
sa
winter
seasonals
to
come
out
my
god
im
going
to
stock
up
on
those
i
love
this
brew
but
of
course
it
takes
a
back
seat
to
old
fezzie
d
i
will
buy
a
few
more
of
these
this
season
a
good
session
beer
with
alot
of
flavor
has
a
nice
brownishamber
appearance
filtered
had
a
nice
head
that
stuck
around
for
most
of
the
beer
smell
i
found
hints
of
the
spices
they
claim
to
have
but
mainly
strong
malty
presence
taste
more
of
the
same
as
with
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
what
you
would
expect
as
well
as
the
drinkability
certainly
a
beer
made
for
average
beer
drinkers
or
drinking
of
high
quantities
nothing
too
stand
out
here
whenever
i
get
a
chance
to
head
to
the
sam
adams
brewpub
im
def
getting
a
few
of
these
from
a
brown

oz
bottle
pours
a
rich
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
malty
with
some
spices
taste
starts
of
malty
and
finishes
bitter
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
a
little
heavy
on
the
stomach
to
drink
to
many
of
these
overall
a
fairly
decent
beer
pours
a
very
dark
copper
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
smell
of
of
roasted
malts
caramel
and
some
bread
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
up
front
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
to
balance
out
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
more
carbonated
than
what
i
expected
for
a
bock
overall
the
drinkability
on
this
is
above
average
solid
selection
d
decent
but
lacking
a
little
in
all
departments
notes
this
is
a
great
winter
beer
with
a
good
balance
of
flavor
complexity
and
drinkability
dark
scarlet
orange
with
a
whipped
tan
head
that
leaves
some
fine
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
biscuit
malty
and
spicy
with
cinnamon
and
orange
zest
it
tastes
much
like
the
smell
spicy
and
clovey
with
sweet
maltiness
and
a
dry
faint
hop
bite
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
a
good
winter
brew
for
the
money
drinks
easily
good
beer
for
a
cold
winter
day
d
goes
down
easy
very
smooth
and
easy
to
reach
for
another
at
the
same
time
not
very
memorable
perhaps
this
would
have
been
better
a
couple
of
months
ago
worth
trying
for
something
different
i
wont
complain
about
this
being
in
the
mix
next
winter
when
i
want
old
fezziwig
unlike
cranberry
lambic
d
good
winter
beer
another
solid
seasonal
from
the
bbc
thanks
for
this
one
jim
you
do
good
work
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
my
grades
for
this
beer
on
tap
and
bottle
seem
fairly
accurate
which
is
a
good
thing
this
one
will
definitely
be
in
my
fridge
next
winter
copper
in
color
holds
a
nice
head
and
has
a
visible
carbonation
or
prickle
classic
beer
smell
with
a
full
mouth
flavor
the
spices
creates
an
almost
hoppy
bitterness
i
had
typically
imbibed
this
beer
from
the
bottle
and
decided
to
pour
it
into
a
pint
glass
for
the
purpose
of
review
i
found
that
i
enjoyed
it
much
more
from
the
bottle
directly
i
suspect
this
is
because
some
of
the
flavors
that
i
did
not
enjoy
or
perhaps
simply
did
not
expect
were
muted
on
the
occasions
where
i
sucked
it
directly
out
of
the
bottle
this
is
decent
but
there
are
much
better
choices
for
this
style
drinkability
this
is
something
that
i
could
easily
drink
2
or
more
of
at
one
sitting
in
short
order
ill
bet
this
is
better
fresh
on
tap
ill
have
to
look
for
it
next
winter
notes
ive
had
a
long
history
with
this
beer
and
it
was
the
first
beer
that
turned
me
to
the
craft
beer
world
i
still
look
forward
to
the
coming
of
winter
and
the
winter
lager
hitting
the
shelves
and
my
friends
and
i
still
like
to
reminisce
about
old
times
with
the
beer
that
opened
all
of
our
eyes
to
how
good
beer
can
be
although
this
obviously
isnt
as
good
as
it
was
when
i
first
had
it
its
still
a
deliciously
perfect
beer
for
the
winter
months
and
ill
probably
buy
at
least
one
sixpack
every
year
for
as
long
as
the
boston
beer
company
keeps
putting
this
beer
out
there
the
appearance
of
this
beer
was
simply
amazing
it
was
amber
or
ruby
in
color
with
two
fingers
worth
of
light
tan
head
that
just
wouldnt
quit
after
every
drink
i
took
it
left
a
thick
ring
completely
around
my
glass
the
smell
was
of
wheat
and
spices
the
taste
started
off
with
a
caramel
and
malt
semi
sweetness
it
had
a
nice
spice
flavor
throughout
it
was
medium
bodied
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
12oz
bottle
into
a
boston
lager
glass
pours
a
crisp
light
copper
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
crisp
sweet
malts
and
slight
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
the
beer
is
fairly
light
but
does
provide
the
warmth
youd
expect
from
a
winter
beer
this
one
is
enjoyable
but
its
not
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
winter
beer
i
feel
like
taste
and
body
wise
this
beer
only
goes
about
70
percent
of
the
way
there
it
has
great
components
that
could
shine
if
only
there
were
a
bit
more
of
them
the
cinnamon
again
comes
through
and
offers
not
only
flavor
but
astringincy
just
not
enough
of
either
this
beer
is
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
isnt
a
big
enough
beer
that
being
said
however
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
them
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
winter
beer
a
nice
alternative
to
heavier
winter
warmers
and
spiced
ales
and
more
approachable
for
those
that
arent
beer
enthusiasts
i
keep
this
one
on
hand
throughout
the
holidays
pours
a
dark
amberbrown
from
the
bottle
with
loads
of
light
brown
head
causing
me
to
slow
my
pour
head
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
however
smell
is
light
but
pleasantbready
and
sweetand
the
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
caramelmolassesbrown
sugar
sweetness
light
spicing
also
in
the
taste
perhaps
the
cinnamon
the
bottle
mentions
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
full
leaving
my
mouth
well
hydrated
this
is
great
stuff
and
ill
look
for
it
again
next
winter
great
beer
as
is
typical
from
sam
adams
you
never
have
to
worry
about
drinking
a
quality
beer
from
the
boston
beer
company
unless
you
dont
like
the
taste
personally
i
find
winter
lager
to
be
their
best
offering
with
a
lovely
color
and
a
nice
thick
but
not
too
overwhelming
of
a
taste
the
smell
seems
a
bit
funky
to
me
but
not
awful
not
bad
better
than
bmc
typical
adams
offering
d
refer
to
mouthfeel
not
something
id
go
out
of
may
way
to
drink
poured
a
copper
red
into
my
goblet
with
a
voluminous
2finger
head
which
leaves
prodigious
lacing
throughout
the
drink
aroma
is
bread
nuts
fig
caramel
a
little
bit
of
toast
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
and
syrupy
with
not
much

taste
is
very
malty
very
much
like
the
aroma
with
lots
of
nuts
and
bread
vanilla
and
caramel
drinkability
is
good
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
and
i
will
seek
this
out
again
drinkability
is
meh
this
is
another
mediocre
smattering
from
sam
adams
slightly
more
drinkable
then
the
rest
but
just
as
easily
forgotten
i
wont
drink
it
again
unless
i
have
to

and

of

toasted

and

grain
with
some

and
ginger
and
a
finish
of
orange
zest
and
lemon
medium
in
body
with
average
carbonation
smooth
with
a
nice
dry
crisp
finish
a
good
session
brew
for
the
winter
months
easy
to
drink
and
somewhat
hearty
to
keep
you
warm
md
not
too
thick
flavor
lingers
briefly
really
drinkable
especially
at
the
price
and
with
the
availability
i
have
gone
through
2
cases
of
this
over
the
winter
and
have
turned
many
noncraft
drinkers
on
to
it
recommended
for
sure
d
it
is
good
not
heavy
enough
that
i
couldnt
have
a
few
but
not
light
enough
to
make
me
need
20
to
be
full
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
as
ive
already
stated
finish
is
drier
the
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
levels
of
carbonation
that
seem
to
be
a
little
high
to
me
they
scrub
away
and
take
the
attention
away
from
the
more
delicate
flavors
in
this
beer
this
beer
is
easy
enough
to
drink
allright
i
finished
that
12er
in
no
time
did
i
enjoy
every
beer
though
was
i
happy
to
be
drinking
every
beer
no
i
didnt
look
forward
to
the
flavor
of
each
and
every
brew
it
was
beer
so
i
drank
it
you
wont
catch
me
buying
this
beer
again
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
why
waste
the
money
when
theres
so
much
better
out
there
d
the
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
can
see
why
its
a
winter
lager
though
because
its
warming
and
it
would
make
you
sweat
on
a
hot
day
d
eh
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
this
review
is
based
off
of
the
08
release
which
i
though
was
far
inferior
to
the
07
release
this
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
creamy
yeast
and
caramel
malt
with
fresh
wheat
and
lemon
and
hops
it
tasted
like
copper
hops
and
earthy
barley
and
sweet
creamy
yeast
with
some
lemon
hops
and
caramel
malt
it
was
somewhat
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
malty
beer
it
smelled
great
but
the
flavor
wasnt
as
big
or
clean
still
it
was
good
with
good
body
too
it
was
definitely
easy
to
drink
almost
like
a
generic
version
of
clipper
citys
winter
storm
pretty
enjoyable
d
somewhat
refreshing
for
a
winter
seasonal
not
overly
complex
just
a
good
drinking
beer
very
good
on
tap
certainly
much
better
than
in
the
bottle
for
a
seasonal
beer
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
drinkable
often
times
holiday
beers
focus
to
much
on
the
spice
i
enjoy
drinking
the
pumpkin
pie
but
would
rather
eat
it
this
winter
larger
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
color
is
nice
and
the
aroma
is
fine
i
dont
taste
much
of
the
spice
which
i
like
i
just
bought
a
case
of
it
at
a
local
beverage
store
and
im
not
dissatisfied
hey
a
case
of
good
beer
for
12
not
bad
drinkability
good
beer
this
is
a
seasonal
that
you
can
find
in
more
bars
than
most
other
good
winter
beers
and
is
often
a
fallback
for
me
in
an
otherwise
bmc
bar
verdict
a
solid
winter
seasonal
and
at
least
in
my
opinion
one
of
sam
adams
best
offerings
a
safe
bet
for
a
mellow
but
still
fullflavored
winter
seasonal
winter
lager
is
worth
a
try
for
sure
nice
but
typically
safe
offering
from
sam
adams
didnt
find
anything
that
stood
out
but
good
for
drinking
a
high
quantitity
for
sure
has
a
nice
brownishamber
appearance
filtered
had
a
nice
head
that
stuck
around
for
most
of
the
beer
smell
i
found
hints
of
the
spices
they
claim
to
have
but
mainly
strong
malty
presence
taste
more
of
the
same
as
with
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
what
you
would
expect
as
well
as
the
drinkability
certainly
a
beer
made
for
average
beer
drinkers
or
drinking
of
high
quantities
nothing
too
stand
out
here
dgot
this
the
variety
pack
one
of
my
favorite
in
it
very
enjoyable
beer
id
consider
buying
in
a
sixer
winter
lagers
a
good
beer
its
definitely
nice
during
the
cold
months
frankly
i
prefer
bbcs
holiday
porter
and
old
fezziwig
i
wish
they
put
those
in
six
packs
but
this
is
good
beer
definitely
one
to
pick
around
this
time
of
year
easily
recommended
very
drinkable
not
heavy
at
all
easy
to
see
having
more
than
a
few
drinkability
quite
drinkable
i
feel
like
this
category
is
the
beers
strong
point
it
is
tasty
malty
crisp
with
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
nicely
done
mr
adams
taste
is
malty
with
a
lot
of
the
sweetness
replaced
by
hoppy
and
toasty
bitterness
not
getting
too
many
winter
spices
in
the
flavor
overall
a
decent
beer
and
i
give
props
to
bbc
for
doing
a
winter
beer
thats
a
lager
im
not
too
sure
of
classifying
this
as
a
bock
due
to
the
wheat
malt
and
spices
used
d
a
heck
of
a
beer
overall
one
that
ill
wait
for
every
year
great
balances
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
spiciness
that
most
beers
dont
have
md
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
poured
into
my
sa
pint
glass
looks
like
a
boston
lager
sweet
malt
and
caramel
aroma
slight
hop
smell
good
bitterness
for
a
lager
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
just
not
what
id
prefer
to
have
again
nothing
too
special
normal
sometimes
normal
is
ok
not
for
me
sa
winter
lager
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
onefinger
offwhite
head
moderate
lacing
the
smell
is
slightly
roasted
malts
and
yeast
with
spices
maybe
allspice
nutmeg
the
taste
is
malty
with
hints
of
allspice
cinnamon
but
not
too
pronounced
mouthfeel
is
crisp
at
first
then
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
much
smoother
than
i
expected
a
very
drinkable
brew
cant
beat
the
price
bottle
from
the
winter
classics
collection
pack
into
my
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
clear
amber
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
to
a
light
cover
some
lacing
present
smells
of
malt
caramel
and
spices
feels
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
definitely
the
malty
characteristics
of
the
boston
lager
but
with
a
sweet
spicey
twist
worth
a
try
cheers
and
hoppy
holidays
very
good
drinkability
a
winter
session
beer
dare
i
say
i
know
i
know
too
much
alcohol
but
it
goes
down
very
easy
a
great
winter
staple
and
its
nice
that
the
freshness
is
ensured
each
year
drinkability
again
i
would
give
it
a
fair
drinkability
but
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
compared
to
the
other
brews
from
sam
adams
its
not
overpowering
though
and
it
would
be
fairly
easy
to
session
with
drinkability
occupies
an
odd
slot
for
me
tasty
and
full
bodied
enough
to
enjoy
a
couple
not
so
flavorful
and
tasty
as
to
be
crave
it
very
often
a
good
brew
but
not
exceptional
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
a
beautiful
twofinger
billowy
head
lacing
is
excellent
smell
is
slightly
spiced
but
mostly
uneventful
taste
is
warm
lightly
spicy
with
large
caramel
overtones
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
a
nice
lingering
flavor
and
aftertaste
drinkability
is
quite
high
with
this
well
balanced
beer
drink
not
too
bad
smooth
going
d
easy
to
drink
smooth
buttery
and
just
a
little
roasty
lightly
roasted
malt
with
caramel
flavors
little
bit
of
hop
to
carry
the
end
but
overall
the
experience
is
sweet
a
little
dry
and
grassy
to
finish
light
to
medium
body
not
too
much
behind
it
very
drinkable
and
inoffensive
easy
to
session
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
its
a
step
above
the
typical
spiced
winter
fare
and
some
at
some
places
probably
a
step
above
what
else
is
on
tap
but
it
probably
wouldnt
make
it
into
a
regular
winter
rotation
for
me
d
definitely
drinkable
very
good
both
fridge
or
cellar
temp
its
quite
refreshing
too
unlike
some
other
winter
beers
so
this
would
be
a
great
choice
for
those
that
live
in
warmer
climates
but
still
want
a
special
seasonal
poured
from
draft
into
pint
glass
poured
a
deep
dark
mahogany
with
a
half
finger
of
tan
head
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
slight
chocolate
smell
taste
is
light
cocoa
with
some
light
malty
taste
in
the
undertones
light
mouthfeel
could
drink
several
of
these
for
sure
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
34
inch
head
of
a
slightly
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
spices
fits
the
style
has
a
smooth
and
very
crisp
mouth
feel
there
was
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
spices
coriander
a
little
hoppiness
is
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
by
any
means
overall
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
worth
a
try
a
lovely
seasonal
offering
from
our
pals
in
jp
readily
available
on
draught
which
is
a
grand
thing
a
clear
dark
amber
pour
with
a
fluffy
but
not
bubbly
offwhitebeigeyellow
head
with
nice
lace
retention
throughout
the
aroma
offers
a
spiced
caramel
malt
as
does
the
taste
although
with
a
fine
not
overwhelmingly
nice
hop
floral
bitterness
very
drinkable
very
flavorful
without
gimicky
sweet
flavors
lighter
amber
color
big
off
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
no
lacing
light
spice
aroma
and
taste
of
the
same
expected
a
darker
wintery
version
there
was
a
hint
of
spices
in
this
beer
but
it
was
really
subtle
overall
a
pleasant
beer
but
nothing
special
the
body
was
too
thin
to
make
it
impressive
i
cant
believe
how
much
better
this
is
on
tap
its
like
a
different
brew
a
nice
beer
for
a
change
of
pace
but
not
one
of
sams
best
it
has
a
dark
and
clear
amber
color
the
scent
is
ok
but
with
a
slight
banana
like
smell
its
fairly
well
carbonated
and
light
on
the
dark
roasted
malt
taste
actually
its
light
on
both
hops
and
malt
its
easy
to
drink
just
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
a
pretty
good
beer
from
sam
adams
not
overpowering
but
solid
nonetheless
goose
island
has
consistently
put
out
bad
tasting
beer
sam
adams
has
put
out
some
decent
beer
but
it
all
starts
tasting
the
same
after
a
while
dlots
of
spices
and
light
body
high
repeatability
not
offensive
drinkability
i
like
it
it
is
not
offensive
it
tastes
like
a
very
tame
ipa
with
a
touch
of
spices
a
very
good
beer
worth
the
cost
and
enjoyed
every
time
i
have
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
it
drinkability
great
really
easy
to
go
through
a
six
pack
each
with
some
good
company
that
being
said
there
are
better
holiday
spiced
beers
out
there
which
is
a
shame
as
i
understand
this
isnt
nearly
as
big
a
beer
as
it
used
to
be
i
wish
i
had
been
able
to
sample
earlier
releases
so
i
would
have
a
basis
for
comparison
drinkability
a
solid
winter
beer
and
very
sessionable
it
was
one
of
the
beers
i
drank
before
i
really
got
into
craft
beers
and
i
still
enjoy
it
notes
a
nice
lager
that
tastes
a
lot
like
a
nice
brown
ale
with
minimal
spicing
nice
and
crisp
beer
but
smooth
also
easy
drinker
tastes
of
aforementioned
roasted
caramel
and
high
malt
light
bitterness
on
this
one
very
good
winter
brew
recommend
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
winter
beers
around
a
must
try
for
all
a
refill
for
me
all
in
all
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
samuel
adams
winter
lager
poured
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
smell
was
light
with
caramel
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
a
light
sweetness
faintest
hint
of
hops
after
it
warmed
more
caramel
was
present
the
mouthfeel
was
ok
drinkability
was
nice
overall
this
is
a
decent
bock
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
flavor
d
typical
sam
adams
competently
brewed
but
certainly
not
offensive
for
the
public
enmasse
once
again
another
perfectly
good
offering
from
sam
adams
not
my
first
pick
for
winter
beers
but
definitely
acceptable
overall
a
good
brew
and
a
definite
recommendation
d
pretty
drinkable
but
not
the
best
winter
beer
to
have
ill
pass
d
drinkable
however
im
not
so
sure
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
doesnt
pack
the
presence
and
flavor
that
id
expect
from
a
winter
beer
nose
is
good
balanced
combo
of
rich
malts
spices
and
hops
taste
is
good
and
is
a
nice
change
from
some
of
the
over
produced
holiday
beers
it
is
smooth
and
balanced
on
the
palate
with
a
combination
of
moderately
rich
malts
sweet
caramel
holiday
spices
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
level
leaves
an
extra
smooth
almost
creamy
finish
two
thumbs
up
on
this
one
dthis
is
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
classic
winter
seasonal
this
beer
probably
has
a
lot
of
nostalgic
appeal
as
its
one
of
the
earlier
craft
beers
that
i
encountered
beyond
the
nostalgia
though
this
one
is
a
good
one
this
beer
is
average
in
my
opinion
it
doesnt
take
any
risks
and
just
gets
by
as
usual
just
what
id
expect
from
the
boston
beer
company
i
dont
know
how
unique
this
brew
is
in
terms
of
a
winter
seasonal
but
its
put
together
very
well
its
said
that
you
must
look
at
the
whole
picture
to
appreciate
it
you
would
be
wise
to
do
the
same
with
this
one
its
quite
hearty
and
will
definately
keep
you
warm
during
the
cold
months
a
musttry
color
is
a
nice
clear
coppery
amber
with
a
decent
head
aroma
is
fairly
strong
malty
with
a
firm
undertone
of
spice
and
a
hint
of
caramel
flavor
matches
the
aroma
malty
and
spicy
with
caramel
and
nutty
hints
texture
is
lively
and
jazzy
leaving
a
pleasing
finish
a
nice
basic
but
tasty
winter
seasonal
overall
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
just
a
solid
brew
overall
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
wont
disappoint
either
i
tend
to
be
a
fan
of
the
sammy
seasonals
no
exception
here
solid
session
effort
d
pretty
drinkable
really
nice
session
winter
brew
that
goes
down
easy
with
decent
flavors
sure
the
look
and
smell
isnt
that
great
but
this
is
a
brew
you
have
several
of
in
a
session
and
pound
still
pretty
damned
good
taste
mouthfeel
delicately
sweet
malt
with
an
almost
peppery
hop
taste
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
little
bit
of
sugar
on
the
tongue
with
a
burnt
hops
taste
prevailing
the
carbonation
works
well
with
the
hops

overall
this
is
a
superdrinkable
sweet
malty
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
having
a
couple
of
times
each
winter
overall
this
is
not
significantly
better
ontap
although
i
kind
of
get
the
impression
that
the
tap
lines
might
not
be
the
most
clean
in
the
world
worth
a
shot
either
way
overall
like
most
sam
adam
brews
im
not
quite
a
fan
their
attempt
to

i
wish
they
could
focus
more
on
improving
their
flavors
and
less
on

the
mass
consumer
with
generic
flavors
that
prove
a
jack
of

but
master

thanks
jim
d
pretty
drinkable
because
its
smooth
and
light
but
nothing
interesting
i
was
hoping
for
more
had
this
ontap
at
olive
garden
not
what
i
expected
in
a
220z
pilsner
glass
again
unexpected
and
found
it
quite
tasty
as
expected
the
beer
was
a
medium
amber
with
orangeish
color
under
a
1
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
leaving
some
decent
if
not
overly
impressive
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
hard
to
quantify
perhaps
due
to
the
restaurant
surroundings
but
light
malt
and
even
a
lighter
spice
were
present
the
taste
was
first
sweet
malt
caramel
and
spice
nutmeg
allspice
with
a
very
light
hop
finish
overshadowed
by
the
spice
the
beer
was
a
bit
thin
but
with
decent
carbonation
so
the
mouthfeel
was
rather
nice
the
drinkability
was
good
and
id
have
had
a
couple
of
more
if
i
hadnt
been
driving
ciao
bella
d
a
seasonal
winter
brew
that
could
be
enjoyed
year
round
easy
to
drink
and
highly
sessionable
not
overly
impressed
by
any
specific
characteristics
but
its
just
a
solid
and
enjoyable
brew
ive
started
the
christmas
meal
off
with
one
of
these
for
the
past
couple
years
and
it
complements
the
heavier
menu
nicely
which
apparently
is
something
they
were
aiming
for
with
this
brew
you
could
easily
drink
2
or
3
with
the
course
of
the
meal
although
i
usually
move
on
to
something
a
bit
heavier
after
the
first
glass
nothing
extraordinary
but
surprisingly
good
for
something
that
is
so
common
in
all
likelihood
ill
be
having
this
again
at
the
next
holiday
gathering
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
my
father
had
a
six
for
me
on
christmas
eve
and
i
had
no
problem
killing
it
dead
i
mightve
even
kept
going
had
there
been
more
mouthfeel
is
crisp
dry
and
quite
sweet
very
easy
to
drinksession
yum
had
this
one
on
friday
at
a
christmas
party
dark
pour
wheat
flavor
nice
hoppy
beer
nice
spices
as
well
not
bad
i
am
warming
up
to
sam
adams
beers
overall
this
beer
was
a
pretty
good
beer
my
friend
stuck
with
the
hoegaarden
he
tends
not
to
like
hoppy
beers
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
this
is
an
enjoyable
winter
brew
compared
to
others
in
the
style
this
is
very
drinkable
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
time
after
time
i
love
the
winter
seasonals
highly
recomended
for
your
winter
enjoyment
d
definitely
easy
to
drink
for
the
flavor
it
has
other
comments
a
good
beer
but
would
be
improved
with
just
a
touch
more
bitterness
maybe
approaching
the
level
of
bittering
used
in
their
boston
lager
i
used
a
bottle
of
this
and
a
bottle
of
old
fezziwig
in
batter
for
cod
last
night
and
that
was
damn
good
i
tried
this
on
tap
last
night
while
out
for
dinner
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
appearance
is
a
dark
amber
color
slightly
darker
than
the
normal
sam
adams
as
i
drank
it
down
the
beer
left
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
mouthfeel
was
not
outstanding
but
gave
a
full
sensation
and
went
well
with
my
steak
certainly
a
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
not
an
all
time
favorite
reviewed
on
12102008
162457my
birthday
drinkability
is
definitely
high
i
can
imagine
being
snowed
in
and
drinking
a
six
pack
of
this
nice
balanced
brew
very
drinkable
light
refreshing
is
advertised
as
being
brewed
with
winter
spices
but
i
really
could
not
pick
any
up
malts
are
very
pronounced
would
buy
again
the
winter
lager
finishes
well
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
smokiness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
overall
i
wouldnt
rank
this
beer
as
an
elite
beer
but
its
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
beer
made
by
a
more
advertised
beer
company
then
your
typical
micro
brewery
a
highly
carbonated
brew
with
a
slight
creaminess
and
a
nice
lager
drinkability
definitely
thought
this
was
an
herbspiced
beer
when
i
tred
it
spices
are
too
overwhelming
to
make
this
an
easy
drink
other
than
that
its
not
bad
though
beer
is
drinkable
and
i
enjoy
this
beer
the
most
when
it
is
paired
with
chicken
wings
deasy
to
drink
but
unfulfilling
i
probably
wouldnt
order
it
again
d
easy
to
drink
although
the
lack
of
hops
makes
it
harder
for
me
to
drink
this
beer
may
give
it
a
shot
again
some
day
but
only
as
a
last
resort
d
im
very
tempted
to
have
another
and
will
look
forward
to
the
rest
of
the
bottles
in
my
sampler
case
i
just
tried
this
beer
side
by
side
with
samual
adams
boston
lager
and
i
hate
to
admit
but
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
of
difference
the
winter
lager
poured
a
couple
shades
darker
and
there
is
a
presence
of
spices
in
the
aroma
it
has
almost
the
same
malty
taste
but
again
there
are
spices
added
a
little
more
peppery
it
has
more
carbonation
than
the
boston
lager
but
same
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
i
have
to
admit
my
respect
for
sam
adams
went
down
a
notch
after
trying
this
i
guess
those
21
proclaimed
beer
styles
will
eventually
bump
into
one
another
eventually
12oz
bottle
poured
into
regular
pint
glass
a
very
lovely
copperyorange
color
about
1
122
fingers
of
head
that
quickly
dissapated
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
not
much
aroma
but
what
there
is
is
very
pleasant
the
spice
aroma
translate
better
into
flavor
when
tasted
not
much
body
very
thin
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
companion
to
a
long
session
the
flavor
and
spice
arent
overpowering
as
is
the
case
with
many
winter
seasonals
i
dont
know
why
i
didnt
like
this
the
last
time
i
drank
it
very
enjoyable
an
easily
sessionable
brew
which
leads
to
this
beer
being
easily
very
drinkable
pours
a
dark
amberlight
brown
with
a
fairly
thin
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
smells
lightly
malty
and
slightly
spicy
with
nutmeg
and
cinammon
and
there
is
a
slight
grainy
sourness
the
taste
is
pretty
mellow
but
nicely
integrated
with
gentle
malt
light
spice
and
a
clean
minerality
and
slight
lager
twang
smooth
and
mellow
in
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
spice
on
the
finish
and
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
but
somewhat
forgettable
pours
a
bronzebrown
with
an
orange
tint
thick
white
head
smells
super
malty
tastes
of
a
bit
of
clove
and
wheat
mostly
caramel
malt
a
bit
vinous
no
hops
to
speak
of
adequate
carbonation
something
that
bbc
always
seems
to
get
perfectly
right
very
good
stuff
here
try
it
out
d
i
could
easily
have
a
six
pack
of
this
balanced
just
right
between
the
sweetness
and
creaminess
this
was
the
third
of
several
different
beers
that
i
had
at
tonights
party
and
was
one
of
the
most
pleasing
of
the
bunch
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
soda
pop
head
that
doesnt
lasts
but
gives
off
yummy
aromas
of
cloves
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
other
spices
that
are
very
enticing
tastes
like
all
of
the
above
spices
compressed
into
deliciously
toasted
malts
that
are
wellbacked
with
citrusy
hops
nice
enough
feel
but
i
agree
with
the
recent
reviewers
below
who
wouldve
preferred
that
it
be
heavier
overall
probably
one
the
best
you
can
find
at
a
major
supermarket
for
next
couple
of
months
perfect
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
of
this
kind
with
controlled
carbonation
and
appropriate
body
when
sa
gets
one
right
it
really
gets
one
right
i
still
think
too
many
of
their
beers
suffer
from
an
insistence
to
try
everything
but
their
hits
boston
lager
black
lager
oktoberfest
are
excellent
maybe
they
should
just
stick
to
lagers
this
is
a
pretty
neat
winter
offering
and
id
happily
have
it
again
however
i
dont
think
its
the
kind
of
beer
id
be
likely
to
hunt
down
as
i
do
see
room
for
improvement
in
the
nose
and
flavour
and
have
found
beers
that
carry
off
this
style
better
easy
to
drink
lager
ive
had
several
of
these
at
one
time
and
enjoyed
them
all
drinkablilty
this
beer
is
definately
a
go
to
beer
for
nights
where
i
want
to
have
a
few
beers
during
a
game
its
full
of
flavor
and
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
that
it
hides
pretty
well
overall
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
again
but
if
you
were
looking
for
a
more
serious
winter
bock
i
would
search
elsewhere
the
beer
is
very
creamy
nicely
carbonated
for
a
bock
beer
has
a
burnt
brown
sugar
roasted
sweet
grain
flavor
there
are
ample
nutmeg
type
spices
maybe
a
little
nuttiness
in
the
background
there
is
a
bit
of
a
hop
presence
right
at
the
finish
but
the
sweet
malts
the
roasted
grains
the
raisiny
sweet
fruits
the
burnt
or
charred
brown
sugars
the
creaminess
throughout
and
the
medium
bodied
sweet
orange
peel
presence
amply
defines
this
beer
this
is
surprisingly
good
ive
turned
away
from
many
sa
products
because
they
are
sometimes
pale
imitators
not
so
this
bock
beer
it
is
quite
good
and
well
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
d
sweeter
than
id
like
but
not
bad
overall
dark
transparent
caramel
color
with
small
white
head
a
quite
unpleasant
aroma
of
sugary
syrupy
molasses
with
dark
fruit
tones
the
taste
is
one
of
a
traditional
bock
but
downgraded
with
massive
amounts
of
sugary
sweet
syrup
deep
dark
fruits
with
some
medicinal
characteristics
and
aunt
jemima
syrup
to
top
it
off
theres
an
aspect
of
artificiality
that
revolves
around
the
drink
that
turns
me
off
like
a
runts
banana
compared
to
a
real
banana
if
youre
looking
for
the
best
or
better
dont
bother
with
this
one
d
you
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
with
good
friends
on
a
cold
winter
night
rereview
drank
a
lot
of
this
over
the
winter
bottled
and
on
tap
and
it
was
solid
all
around
like
most
of
jims
beers
id
like
to
see
it
taken
up
a
notch
but
kudos
to
him
for
what
he
is
doing
and
i
must
remember
he
is
brewing
for
the
masses
sa
seasonal
is
usually
the
only
viable
choice
in
the
sea
of
macros
available
at
such
places
as
fridays
i
definately
prefer
winter
over
the
standard
sa
boston
d
tastes
pretty
much
like
i
remembered
from
when
it
first
came
out
not
too
terribly
interesting
but
a
good
session
beer
i
guess
you
could
have
these
one
after
another
but
i
couldnt
buy
a
case
of
this
stuff
decent
but
not
over
the
top
can
sip
or
have
with
food
worth
a
try
d
nothing
stands
out
good
or
bad
its
fairly
drinkable
but
it
might
be
hard
to
get
all
the
way
through
this
keg
12oz
bottle
served
in
sa
sensory
pint
best
by
march
2009
notched
on
the
bottle
poured
a
deep
translucent
copper
with
a
half
inch
loose
white
cap
embedded
with
clusters
of
grapelike
rings
head
quickly
dissipated
into
a
swirl
of
foam
with
a
solid
ring
around
the
shoulders
nose
is
malty
with
a
touch
of
spice
taste
follows
nose
with
some
additional
caramel
character
and
a
light
hops
bittering
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
fell
between
light
and
mediumbodied
but
closer
to
light
with
a
subtle
background
effervescence
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
seasonal
dthis
one
let
me
down
a
little
this
year
i
remember
really
liking
it
last
year
and
im
not
sure
if
its
due
to
how
much
my
palate
has
changed
or
what
but
with
all
the
fantastic
winters
out
there
i
cant
see
picking
this
one
up
again
this
year
drinkability
is
very
good
if
you
are
looking
for
a
spicy
winter
lager
drinkability
is
good
the
spices
give
a
warming
sensation
that
is
welcomed
on
a
day
with
cold
rain
and
snow
and
a
temperature
near
freezing
d
excellent
winter
beer
sweet
with
a
well
balanced
spice
note
these
go
down
very
nice
on
a
cold
winter
night
notes
a
good
sessionable
winter
offering
from
sa
it
hits
the
right
notes
hint
of
wintertype
spices
some
warmth
from
alcohol
without
going
overboard
anywhere
nicely
balanced
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
good
but
the
sweetness
and
spice
would
get
old
pretty
quickly
very
drinkable
brew
a
nice
easy
drinking
amber
lager
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
decent
big
bubbled
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
smells
slightly
sweet
some
what
metallic
cant
detect
any
spices
or
much
hops
taste
is
nice
toasty
malt
ginger
honey
maybe
nutmeg
or
something
i
cant
quite
place
very
nice
taste
it
has
a
warming
feel
to
it
carbed
just
right
it
has
a
very
soft
feel
to
it
very
enjoyable
its
almost
cottony
toasty
sweet
wonderful
brew
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
a
must
have
on
a
cold
night
like
tonight
im
so
glad
i
bought
a
6
pack
yummy
yummy
yummy
deep
copper
hue
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
nutmeg
cinnamon
toasted
malt
wheat
hints
of
honey
and
citrus
the
taste
is
peppery
really
citrus
and
acidic
there
where
hints
of
spices
this
wasnt
a
bad
lager
is
was
rather
nice
and
warming
for
those
cold
nights
smooth
like
all
sam
adams
products
but
not
much
else
better
than
average
atmosphere
good
flavor
and
drinkability
really
good
balance
d
goes
down
very
well
an
excellent
cold
weather
drink
m
d
drinks
damn
well
for
a
hearty
brew
d
low
abv
excellent
flavor
that
screams
winter
is
here
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
wonderful
one
to
have
during
the
holidays
so
much
so
that
my
wife
initially
drank
most
of
my
first
beer
and
then
ordered
one
for
herself
and
she
is
not
a
beer
drinker
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
recommended
poured
aggressively
into
a
pint
glass
a
murky
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
smells
of
malt
and
spice
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
tastes
pretty
much
the
way
it
smells
sweet
malt
and
spices
with
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
all
i
have
and
will
drink
a
few
more
of
these
good
beer
overall
easy
to
drink
enough
to
drink
though
there
are
some
barely
noticable
odd
notes
in
the
taste
and
mouthfee
after
reading
the
description
of
a
bock
this
was
really
true
to
style
more
like
a
review
of
this
beer
d
very
drinkable
good
choice
depending
on
what
may
be
available
more
flavor
would
helb
this
beer
d
i
could
have
had
two
more
of
these
without
thinking
about
it
a
great
flavor
and
good
drinking
beer
bottle
auburn
pour
minimal
head
weak
aroma
of
malt
spice
and
some
citrus
flat
flavor
more
malt
than
anything
else
not
really
what
i
expected
from
a
bock
thinner
than
it
should
be
and
lacking
in
substance
didnt
quite
get
the
spiciness
everyone
else
raves
about
decent
but
a
lot
weaker
than
i
hoped
for
creamy
tan
head
ruby
colour
aroma
of
spices
ginger
cinnamon
malt
sweet
flavour
is
malty
sweet
caramel
christmasy
spices
very
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
not
a
spectacular
beer
in
that
it
is
not
aggressive
in
any
way
but
looking
att
the
beautiful
lacing
smelling
the
aroma
of
christmas
and
feeling
its
warming
soft
quality
puts
you
in
the
christmas
spirit
like
no
other
beer
would
get
again
not
going
to
have
this
one
again
overall
a
very
nice
lager
one
of
sam
adams
better
offerings
d
a
sweet
beer
without
being
overdone
and
an
excellent
combination
of
malt
and
spice
not
as
heavy
and
overpowering
as
i
remember
it
on
tap
from
the
night
before
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
before
the
season
is
up
d
this
a
great
example
of
a
christmas
beer
with
enough
of
a
bock
characteristic
to
let
both
crowds
enjoy
a
wonderful
seasonal
beer
pours
a
solid
amber
color
with
a
strong
slightly
sticky
head
husky
malt
aroma
with
a
spice
character
a
medium
bodied
smooth
lager
the
maltiness
indicates
the
bock
influence
of
this
beer
but
the
husky
grain
could
be
a
little
more
bold
the
beer
finishes
quick
with
some
pleasant
spice
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
an
earthiness
pervades
the
entire
experience
not
overwhelming
and
a
good
drinking
beer
ive
had
this
beer
at
least
once
that
past
few
years
and
keep
overall
i
feel
that
this
beer
lacks
a
true
sense
of
what
it
wants
to
be
the
list
of
ingredients
in
this
beer
sounds
convincing
however
they
are
imbalanced
and
seem
to
clash
with
one
another
i
think
with
a
proper
cohesion
in
flavor
perhaps
more
malt
would
work
this
could
be
a
winner
aroma
and
flavors
of
spicy
earthy
malts
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
hops
kick
in
toward
the
end
with
a
light
pine
touch
although
nothing
is
too
overbearing
here
a
little
weak
overall
a
dry
finish
pours
a
medium
brown
red
color
body
with
a
white
head
that
is
lasting
has
a
slight
aroma
of
hops
some
spices
and
maybe
wheat
a
nice
taste
of
spices
some
barley
dry
in
the
palate
a
pale
taste
might
be
a
little
old
definitely
a
very
good
beer
one
of
samuel
adams
best
beers
a
great
winter
brew
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
i
remember
this
one
being
a
little
better
a
few
years
back
maybe
this
is
better
on
tap
ive
had
this
3
times
on
tap
in
the
past
2
nights
and
it
sure
is
a
treat
a
nice
dark
brown
in
color
awesome
lacing
a
nice
size
head
smell
is
of
rich
caramel
and
spice
a
decent
combination
of
malty
characteristics
goes
down
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
that
you
have
to
have
on
tap
to
experience
its
real
potential
sas
winter
lager
continues
to
be
my
goto
beer
on
tap
this
year
only
because
its
stayed
the
same
over
the
past
few
years
and
bbc
hasnt
screwed
with
the
formula
overall
this
is
a
sure
pleaser
this
coming
winter
if
your
in
search
for
a
tasty
hearty
beer
on
tap
not
great
but
definitely
not
bad
sessionable
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
as
about
high
as
it
gets
this
is
a
great
beer
with
just
about
anything
today
it
was
pizza
yummy
poured
hard
at
the
bar
in
a
pint
glass
a
wonderful
honey
color
with
a
spirited
2
finger
head
that
lasted
forever
a
nice
aroma
of
sweet
malt
that
was
complimented
with
a
flowery
hop
presence
great
tasting
brew
just
enough
hops
to
not
let
the
malt
overpower
a
hint
of
orange
rounds
it
out
making
for
an
excellent
flavor
the
beer
is
rich
and
complex
yet
drinks
easily
all
in
all
a
fine
beer
mid
body
good
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
i
end
up
with
a
couple
twelve
packs
every
year
i
love
the
taste
it
is
also
very
drinkable
not
at
all
overly
spicy
as
i
was
afraid
but
slightly
just
hints
and
it
was
biscuity
malty
well
rounded
mouthfeel
i
would
say
is
around
average
for
sam
beer
good
carbonation
substantial
this
is
one
of
bbs
best
and
im
not
afraid
to
say
it
sweet
malts
and
hops
smells
which
come
through
in
the
taste
i
like
the
carbonation
and
smoothness
of
this
brew
one
thing
about
sam
adams
beers
is
that
they
are
full
bodied
you
can
tell
they
take
time
in
the
brewing
very
drinkable
though
much
more
breadlike
in
character
than
would
be
expected
and
certainly
falling
behind
in
the
flavor
profile
of
the
bottled
version
d
this
is
a
good
brew
nothing
too
great
i
have
had
many
better
bocks
like
i
said
i
could
only
drink
four
in
a
night
before
moving
on
to
something
a
bit
better
at
the
bar
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
beer
only
slightly
better
than
average
d
it
goes
down
fairly
easily
a
good
wintertime
gulper
for
sure
pretty
easy
drinking
but
nothung
special
m
d
a
rather
straight
forward
feel
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
about
right
inoffensive
easy
drinking
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
aroma
is
that
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
along
with
a
malty
sweetness
and
some
citrus
taste
is
rich
and
full
bodied
nice
malt
flavor
good
balance
in
the
spice
department
the
orange
zest
is
a
nice
touch
not
too
heavy
blends
in
well
with
the
cinnamon
and
ginger
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
beer
for
a
cold
winters
nite
thinish
as
most
sam
adams
are
this
could
use
more
body
but
it
drinks
well
and
is
satisfying
i
would
say
to
them
save
the
additions
they
dont
really
come
through
just
up
the
malt
a
bit
if
you
want
a
beer
with
good
cinnamonginger
see
great
lakes
christmas
ale
are
really
good
one
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
and
is
pretty
drinkable
it
goes
down
well
and
has
a
nice
smooth
feel
m
a
little
lighter
then
i
expected
but
not
too
light
adds
to
the
drinkability
of
this
not
a
heavy
beer
but
not
too
light
either
notes
well
this
one
is
still
tasty
and
will
more
than
likely
continue
to
be
although
it
is
not
pack
a
punch
like
it
used
to
it
can
hold
its
own
rather
well
cheers
id
consider
this
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
it
has
a
nice
texture
and
pretty
tame
carbonation
very
nice
beer
for
this
time
of
year
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
a
sixer
of
these
for
thanksgiving
or
christmas
dinner
pretty
easy
to
drink
good
balance
of
spice
vs
malt
and
hops
probably
the
best
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
this
beer
is
a
favorite
my
highest
review
so
far
my
first
experience
with
a
winter
brew
not
too
heavy
but
just
right
i
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
the
brew
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
the
smell
is
unremarkable
there
is
a
slight
malt
sweetness
but
nothing
else
sticks
out
the
taste
is
pleasnt
malt
with
a
dry
finish
i
do
not
taste
any
of
the
spices
the
beer
is
full
bodied
and
quite
drinkable
an
enjoyable
part
of
the
mixed
pack
but
i
think
it
used
to
be
better
i
poured
this
12
ounce
beer
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
pours
a
copperamber
color
with
a
1
and
a
half
finger
beige
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
a
vegetable
like
malt
not
too
different
from
a
typical
amber
the
taste
is
fairly
well
balanced
with
slightly
muddy
caramel
flavors
could
use
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
bite
there
is
a
light
to
medium
mouth
feel
slightly
sticky
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
for
when
the
mercury
starts
to
drop
i
would
probably
like
to
break
it
up
with
a
stout
or
a
slightly
more
hoppy
pa
if
i
was
tossing
down
several
d
i
had
a
nice
mini
session
that
could
have
gone
on
long
into
the
night
it
was
balanced
tasty
lightbodied
and
had
a
modest
abv
this
beer
pours
an
extreme
copper
color
it
is
rather
deep
and
glows
slightly
there
is
a
thin
ivory
head
that
fades
fast
lace
minimal
but
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
more
sweet
then
spicy
there
are
slightly
muted
hints
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
malty
sweetness
subdued
overall
with
a
burned
caramel
taste
is
all
over
the
place
spice
sweet
malts
all
hit
the
taste
buds
its
not
a
stand
out
beer
but
one
that
you
can
easily
go
back
to
feel
is
lighter
then
expected
in
a
winter
lager
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
sams
brews
however
the
winter
lager
is
more
palatable
than
other
brews
i
wouldnt
purposely
go
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
but
certainly
would
not
turn
it
down
this
is
a
very
light
version
of
a
winter
beer
as
far
as
winter
beers
go
normally
however
i
think
this
wheat
lager
was
clearly
intended
to
be
this
way
easy
drinking
d
easy
enough
to
put
back
a
few
one
of
the
better
lagers
from
boston
beer
23
in
a
sitting
would
be
plenty
d
this
is
not
the
winter
lager
of
a
few
years
ago
but
the
lower
abv
makes
it
much
easier
to
consume
a
few
d
great
with
a
hearty
meal
this
is
very
nice
a
good
start
to
my
trying
of
winter
brews
drinkability
is
excellent
i
always
remember
this
as
a
good
beer
but
i
am
amazed
at
how
much
i
am
enjoying
it
this
year
like
i
said
earlier
everything
i
have
had
from
this
years
winter
sampler
is
better
than
i
remember
highly
enjoyable
and
highly
recommended
d
not
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
sam
adams
but
not
a
bad
brew
definitely
doesnt
fit
a
winter
warmer
style
3
5
had
one
at
bruins
game
recently
bs
beat
the
pens
30
and
sam
adams
seems
to
have
upped
the
spice
eew
pours
a
dark
brownorange
with
sudsy
eggshell
head
and
spotty
lacing
smell
mostly
caramel
with
some
wheat
in
the
background
vague
spice
herbal
hops
taste
toasted
caramel
malt
sweet
some
notes
of
cinnamon
orange
juicegingerleafy
hops
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
slick
sticky
finish
pretty
good
could
be
a
bit
heftier
the
sam
winter
lager
is
a
nice
highly
drinkable
beer
nothing
fancy
but
they
do
a
very
good
job
here
by
keeping
it
simple
and
not
trying
to
overdo
it
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
sams
summer
ale
but
the
winter
lager
is
one
that
i
return
to
every
season
when
i
get
tired
of
the
overspiced
christmas
beers
out
there
a
reliable
brew
this
one
drinkability
this
had
been
my
favorite
winter
brew
for
years
mainly
because
it
never
disappoints
and
is
widely
available
during
the
winter
months
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
from
bottles
and
straight
from
the
tap
i
would
drink
this
again
anytime
overall
always
a
good
decision
d
good
veryy
nice
for
a
winter
night
mild
balanced
flavors
make
this
one
a
pretty
drinkable
winter
beer
winter
lager
is
a
decent
beer
though
there
are
many
better
seasonal
offerings
that
id
choose
to
enjoy
on
a
cold
southern
california
night
a
great
darkish
tan
pour
with
a
fluffy
off
white
head
tastes
malty
sweet
with
low
hop
bitterness
id
have
liked
if
it
had
a
bit
more
abv
but
all
in
all
a
decent
representation
of
style
full
bodied
and
smooth
it
goes
down
easy
and
as
we
all
know
sam
adams
makes
some
devilishly
drinkable
beer
d
even
though
being
quite
the
mouthful
this
is
a
really
easy
drinker
i
could
have
a
session
with
this
beer
simply
because
it
isnt
bursting
with
flavor
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
senses
nice
beer
all
around
but
kinda
bland
in
the
nose
and
that
translates
to
the
taste
as
well
md
the
beer
had
a
lighttomedium
body
a
little
light
in
the
level
of
carbonation
and
maybe
a
little
watered
down
the
beer
was
smooth
and
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
overall
an
average
beer
kind
of
par
for
the
course
with
sam
adams
all
in
all
quite
drinkable
lager
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
though
it
does
play
things
a
bit
safe
well
balanced
and
great
for
the
nonbeer
drinkers
seasonal
d
not
real
heavy
of
a
beer
with
a
relatively
low
abv
not
a
bad
fall
back
beer
during
winter
since
this
is
pretty
much
everywhere
with
a
modest
abv
you
can
drink
a
bit
of
this
and
not
worry
too
much
drinkability
easy
to
drink
it
tastes
good
and
it
goes
down
well
low
abv
for
a
bock
though
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
drinkability
i
was
kind
of
expecting
a
let
down
on
this
one
but
it
turned
out
alright
rather
enjoyable
while
not
too
heavy
overall
d
since
it
is
the
holiday
season
and
there
are
sooo
many
wonderful
beers
to
try
i
will
have
to
see
you
next
year
unless
i
purchase
another
winter
classic
sampler
that
is
your
stout
and
porter
brothers
are
the
reason
that
i
purchase
the
sampler
though
sorry
d
a
rather
great
winter
beer
the
spices
arent
overpowering
as
featured
in
many
other
winter
brews
decent
amount
of
alcohol
to
warm
up
with
but
perhaps
too
much
to
make
a
session
winter
beer
out
of
this
dnot
too
bad
at
all
d
unsurprisingly
this
is
a
nice
above
average
across
the
board
brew
from
sa
id
have
liked
to
see
a
more
aggressive
hop
and
spice
presence
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
what
theyve
done
here
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
very
active
carbonation
nice
two
finger
white
head
smells
sweet
and
a
little
chocolatey
taste
of
some
ginger
i
dont
know
if
i
taste
that
just
becuase
it
says
it
on
the
box
but
it
also
says
cinnamon
and
but
i
dont
taste
that
mouthfeel
is
good
fairly
fizzy
in
the
mouth
but
nothign
special
i
will
finish
this
6
pack
but
probably
wont
seek
this
out
again
nothing
special
another
great
beer
by
sas
a
nice
dark
copper
pour
with
a
one
finger
white
head
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
some
spice
the
flavor
really
shines
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrussome
cinnamon
maybe
some
coriander
very
balanced
creamy
mouthfeelwith
soft
carbonationand
a
dash
of
hops
in
the
finish
a
solid
offering
thanks
sam
nicely
drinkable
a
good
beer
but
not
overly
complex
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
to
it
future
outlook
another
solid
addition
to
the
samuel
adams
winter
classics
mix
pack
which
i
will
surely
pick
up
again
next
season
this
is
a
beer
that
seems
just
right
for
a
celebration
and
it
may
not
be
the
best
beer
for
the
coldest
days
but
it
sure
is
a
winter
beer
it
seems
to
get
better
as
you
drink
more
of
it
and
it
leaves
you
with
a
good
aftertaste
definitely
worth
the
try
and
i
know
ill
be
getting
it
again
for
special
occasions
this
winter
and
hopefully
for
winters
to
come
again
highly
recommend
and
i
love
the
colors
on
the
label
d
a
nice
easy
beer
to
relax
with
in
the
winter
i
plan
on
having
a
few
more
of
these
throughout
the
season
mfd
imo
not
a
bock
at
all
but
nevertheless
a
quality
beer
great
beer
to
quaff
throughout
the
holiday
season
seasons
greetings
this
beer
of
dark
robust
brown
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
giving
itself
a
good
frothing
of
head
and
a
lingerence
of
lace
the
aroma
is
a
good
mixture
of
cinnimon
and
hoppier
beer
when
tasting
a
slight
cinnimon
taste
is
there
that
mixes
with
the
ginger
giving
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
a
sam
adams
beer
drinker
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
copper
color
with
a
light
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
nebulous
cap
big
thick
sweet
malt
aroma
with
some
cinnamon
and
wheaty
esters
flavor
is
less
sweet
with
dark

semi
dry
finish
thinnish
body
no
real
distinguishing
features
here
needs
to
be
thicker
and
sweeter
to
be
a
good
winter
beer
drinkability
is
very
good
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
having
more
of
these
through
the
season
as
long
as
it
is
available
that
is
last
year
it
dissapeared
from
the
store
long
before
winter
actually
arrived
an
excellent
beer
d
this
was
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
will
gladly
order
again
when
i
am
at
a
nonbeer
restaurant
moderate
alcohol
and
good
flavor
make
this
highly
sessionable
drinkability
is
high
its
a
solid
beer
with
decent
flavor
and
easily
enjoyable
one
of
my
favorite
from
sa
and
one
of
my
conversion
beers
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
beers
and
one
of
my
favorite
american
bocks
very
tasty
and
highly
recommended
like
almost
everything
else
from
samuel
adams
winter
lager
is
a
decent
solid
representation
of
the
intended
style
but
it
makes
its
way
softly
without
kicking
in
any
doors
or
breaking
any
new
ground
the
brew
is
mediumbodied
and
very
smooth
with
light
carbonation
and
is
highly
drinkable
good
drinkability
and
the
slightly
higher
abv
is
wellmasked
seems
to
be
getting
better
the
warmer
they
get
and
the
more
i
drink
pretty
firmly
carbonated
yet
the
reduced
bitterness
makes
this
beer
a
bit
more
drinkable
nonetheless
the
comparisons
to
boston
lager
are
undeniable
and
this
is
slightly
better
and
in
fact
a
bit
reminiscent
of
the
bl
of
yore
but
not
quite
the
nose
on
the
beer
has
a
bit
of
hops
to
it
with
a
nice
toasty
malt
hint
to
it
there
is
a
slight
bit
of
dark
malts
as
well
the
beer
pours
with
an
inch
head
and
the
beer
has
a
dark
copper
colour
to
it
it
looks
incredibly
clear
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
a
sweetness
that
comes
out
more
when
the
beer
is
poured
the
beer
is
sweet
bitter
and
toasty
its
almost
like
an
oktoberfest
with
a
focus
on
complexity
rather
than
drinkability
there
is
the
usual
lager
crispness
that
is
expected
though
the
sweetness
tastes
absolutely
wonderfull
im
really
surprised
at
the
great
balace
of
the
sweetness
bitterness
and
toastiness
yet
leaving
some
room
for
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
but
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
for
the
amount
flavours
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
to
grab
especially
for
someone
who
isnt
into
darker
beers
this
beer
is
wonderful
it
pours
a
beautiful
cooper
color
and
has
a
foam
that
lingers
low
carbonation
this
beer
is
just
wonderful
with
just
the
right
amount
of
winter
time
spice
i
was
really
surprised
by
how
good
this
beer
really
was
and
i
must
say
it
is
one
of
the
best
that
sam
adams
puts
out
i
like
sam
adams
but
this
is
absolutely
one
of
their
better
brews
highly
recommended
and
one
i
will
be
buying
all
winter
drinkability
oh
how
i
wish
this
wasnt
my
last
one
i
have
been
saving
it
for
almost
a
year
now
and
i
do
wish
so
primarily
due
to
the
fact
that
it
holds
a
balance
between
the
almost
equally
satisfying
smell
and
taste
experiences
wich
qualifies
sam
adams
winter
lager
as
a
definite
lets
have
another
one
eher
the
taste
brings
cinnamon
to
the
game
along
with
the
orange
light
chocolate
and
corriander
it
is
smooth
and
hits
mostly
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
a
little
bitterness
that
is
welcome
after
all
the
spice
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
sam
adams
is
the
best
value
on
the
american
market
for
beer
although
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
its
up
there
and
its
always
a
trusty
option
when
a
bar
doesnt
have
a
good
selection
of
beer
you
can
never
go
wrong
with
a
sam
adams
product
had
a
rough
morning
so
i
cracked
one
of
these
sobs
open
because
it
had
often
been
a
winter
warmer
for
me
in
the
past
i
reviewed
the
appearance
and
jumped
in
the
shower
yes
i
drank
this
in
the
shower
and
wrote
the
rest
by
memory
after
my
morning
coffee
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
was
a
copperamber
color
leaning
towards
the
dark
side
with
some
visible
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
tan
displayed
nice
retention
and
lacing
too
the
aroma
was
mostly
spices
and
malt
with
some
sweetness
the
flavors
were
first
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
blended
with
winter
spices
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
followed
by
a
bite
of
hoppiness
at
the
end
the
suddenness
of
the
hops
gave
the
beer
a
slightly
astringent
quality
still
the
body
was
medium
the
carbonation
average
and
the
mouthfeel
good
it
didnt
save
my
day
but
this
beer
totally
took
the
edge
off
my
morning
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
the
caramel
and
the
trademark
strong
hoppiness
of
sam
adams
toasted
malt
as
well
fairly
mellow
and
plain
going
down
also
quite
tart
however
clean
and
clear
while
being
easy
to
drink
this
is
an
updated
review
from
almost
2
years
ago
and
i
know
find
this
beer
much
better
than
before
i
must
say
this
seasonal
offering
from
sam
adams
sort
of
let
me
down
i
like
almost
all
of
their
beers
but
this
one
just
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
i
tried
it
plenty
of
times
but
found
it
to
be
lacking
too
much
in
overall
flavor
the
appearance
is
beautiful
and
it
is
a
good
beer
body
wise
but
the
flavor
department
is
just
lacking
way
too
much
for
me
second
best
sam
adams
you
can
get
the
flavor
is
very
rich
and
delicious
highly
recomend
this
beer
has
nice
head
and
is
good
with
a
nice
dinner
of
lets
say
steak
and
potatoes
it
warms
the
heart
when
you
drink
it
even
if
the
beer
is
ice
cold
when
winter
rolls
around
def
pick
some
up
dark
amber
in
color
with
the
spices
that
make
it
a
good
seasonal
beer
i
still
prefer
the
sam
adams
lager
or
the
boston
ale
over
this
one
even
in
the
winter
spicy
malty
aroma
medium
tan
head
and
a
pretty
good
amount
of
lacing
this
is
a
little
more
hearty
than
their
standard
lager
malty
and
spicy
with
some
sugar
notes
in
the
taste
a
sour
finish
and
aftertaste
a
decent
seasonal
selection
from
sam
adams
dnothing
crazy
more
or
less
a
bready
fruitier
spiced
version
of
boston
lager
this
is
fine
nonoffensive
tasty
with
a
nice
nose
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
if
given
a
choice
there
are
better
holiday
offerings
available
enjoyed
a
couple
of
these
on
tap
at
a
pub
the
other
night
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
although
it
was
served
up
in
a
plastic
cup
it
was
still
a
very
good
experience
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
the
aroma
was
spicy
and
malty
very
appealing
the
flavor
was
fantastic
very
malty
and
sweet
with
a
well
balanced
mix
of
spices
and
citrus
notes
thick
mouthfeel
and
the
beer
finishes
creamy
and
smoooth
i
would
order
this
one
again
in
a
heartbeat
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
caramel
color
with
smell
of
sweet
fruits
nice
creamy
head
and
very
creamy
and
flavorfull
it
is
very
nice
in
your
mouth
refreshing
it
has
a
sweet
finish
to
it
at
the
end
the
only
thing
about
sam
adams
i
dont
like
they
price
all
their
beers
to
high
i
will
most
likely
get
a
case
again
next
winter
as
this
beer
is
a
great
product
d
decent
drinkability
with
a
good
hearty
wheat
bock
body
and
subtle
spicings
makes
this
a
decent
brew
that
along
with
a
fairly
low
abv
could
be
easily
drunk
in
multiples
drinkability
not
the
best
bock
that
ive
had
and
not
the
worst
its
just
alright
anyway
it
poured
a
clear
amber
brown
with
a
slight
head
that
stuck
around
just
lightly
at
first
it
was
a
little
roasty
and
included
some
spice
flavor
matched
with
some
hops
with
a
good
balance
but
as
i
drank
more
of
it
it
became
more
and
more
yeasty
the
yeast
seemed
to
dominate
the
flavor
for
me
and
the
mouthfeel
i
was
really
expecting
some
roasted
malts
in
this
but
was
a
little
let
down
the
flavor
made
sense
though
because
the
label
says
a
dark
wheat
lager
brewed
with
winter
spices
sa
seems
to
really
like
including
wheat
in
all
their
seasonals
and
again
sam
adams
meets
expectations
cant
say
ive
ever
been
wowd
but
they
always
meet
your
expectations
well
a
dark
amber
beer
with
an
average
tan
head
the
nose
and
taste
are
a
little
light
for
my
idea
of
a
good
bock
there
are
toasty
grains
subtle
hops
and
some
caramel
sweetness
good
start
but
needs
more
the
body
is
clean
and
light
with
marginal
carbonation
another
session
brew
from
sam
adams
this
beer
is
matched
up
very
well
with
its
season
its
best
served
in
a
cold
glass
in
the
low
40s
f
the
head
is
fairly
frothy
and
the
appearance
is
a
dark
golden
color
the
taste
is
strong
and
refreshing
with
hints
of
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
its
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
easily
a
beer
you
could
drink
in
heavy
succession
prost
drinkability
is
rather
excellent
its
hard
to
stop
drinking
this
brew
and
im
able
to
savor
every
last
drop
and
look
forward
to
this
beer
being
rereleased
every
winter
for
additional
massachusetts
winter
beers
id
also
suggest
wachusetts
winter
lager
drinkability
this
is
a
merely
good
lager
as
for
sessionability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
sitting
only
occassionally
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
overall
a
very
good
example
of
a
bock
very
drinkable
recommended
clear
copper
pour
with
a
big
offwhite
head
smell
is
tart
malt
with
spices
and
i
got
no
wheat
from
it
taste
is
spiced
like
an
english
strong
ale
perhaps
some
biscuity
notes
i
didnt
see
this
as
a
weizen
bock
at
all
but
still
enjoyed
the
beer
to
me
this
was
a
classic
example
of
a
good
christmas
beer
worth
trying
and
i
seemed
to
have
enjoyed
it
more
than
my
rating
indicates
aggressive
still
a
decent
brew
and
readily
available
i
could
drink
this
everyday
especially
when
a
12
pack
is
on
sale
for
five
bucks
whoa
this
beer
is
to
the
winter
what
s
a
summer
ale
is
to
the
summer
a
very
refreshing
drinkable
beer
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
and
a
great
addition
to
the
winter
classics
variety
case
very
smooth
wellbalanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
these
all
winter
long
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
for
me
i
really
like
wheat
beers
but
i
think
it
just
tasted
too
processed
d
definitely
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
recommended
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
n
b
the
freshest
by
month
was
not
notched
and
this
was
neither
fresh
or
foul
a
traditioanl
lager
with
some
varied
malts
and
added
flavors
a
very
tasty
quaffable
brew
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
good
bit
of
slightly
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
touch
of
lacing
as
it
goes
down
nose
is
nice
lots
of
sweet
malt
some
grapes
and
fruitiness
taste
is
similar
very
tasty
not
the
post
complex
beer
ive
ever
tasted
but
one
id
drink
a
fair
bit
a
nice
surprise
actually
much
better
than
i
expected
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
was
a
nice
treat
not
a
super
beer
but
one
i
could
sip
on
for
days
i
had
this
on
tap
this
evening
while
bowling
not
that
that
matters
the
winter
lager
had
a
nice
amber
color
that
i
liked
but
had
no
head
this
was
probably
due
to
the
glassware
at
the
bowling
alley
so
i
still
gave
it
a
3
5
for
appearance
if
i
were
judging
it
against
style
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
bock
to
me
if
i
were
judging
it
as
a
continental
lager
or
a
european
dark
lager
it
would
get
big
points
the
malty
flavor
dominates
but
its
not
too
sweet
i
drank
it
pretty
quickly
so
it
must
have
been
decent
for
the
record
it
was
the
only
beer
that
i
had
tonight
so
i
feel
confident
in
my
rating
a
d
i
didnt
intend
for
it
to
be
quite
that
low
i
stand
by
my
statement
above
at
the
worst
it
is
a
c
no
lower
poured
a
fizzy
yellow
like
a
macro
wait
it
is
a
macro
smell
is
sugary
carmel
and
fruit
like
aromas
taste
is
raisin
and
caramel
with
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
really
sweet
and
pretty
good
decent
and
typical
sam
adams
still
sa
could
do
a
whole
lot
more
than
these
weak
efforts
seem
to
offer
has
a
copperish
body
with
ruby
tint
with
a
small
head
that
receded
with
no
lacings
the
smell
is
rather
bland
picked
up
some
spice
with
the
malts
and
some
hop
sharpness
but
nothing
stood
out
the
taste
was
alright
i
picked
up
some
hops
and
hints
of
caramel
malt
that
balanced
out
real
good
for
a
smooth
light
to
medium
body
that
contained
some
spice
nothing
real
standout
especially
for
a
winter
seasonal
but
it
gets
the
job
done
drinkability
nice
wish
is
was
avaliable
more
often
aroma
is
sweet
grainy
malts
with
piney
hops
and
some
spices
with
a
touch
of
yeast
pour
yeilds
a
clear
ambertinged
brown
beer
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
has
good
lacing
flavor
finishes
bitter
and
salty
but
pleasent
yeasty
aftertaste
watery
body
and
fizzy
carbonation
but
doesnt
go
down
exceptionally
smoothly
drinkability
decent
beer
but
seems
like
it
could
be
so
much
more
if
things
were
just
pumped
up
a
bit
as
with
many
sam
adams
this
is
a
decent
beginners
beer
but
doesnt
do
much
after
you
have
tried
other
spicy
winter
beers
this
is
the
downside
to
the
holiday
mix
pack
in
my
opinion
cheers
d
i
think
i
could
drink
a
few
at
this
time
of
year
when
it
comes
out
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
12er
of
them
the
slightly
higher
alcohol
content
was
noticeable
this
is
a
very
tasty
winter
bock
and
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
ones
from
sam
adams
with
a
good
tate
profile
and
easy
drinkibility
its
one
that
i
never
hesitate
to
order
up
when
im
dining
out
somewhere
d
good
drinkability
and
an
easily
sessionable
lager
taste
is
very
crisp
mostly
controlled
by
the
caramel
malt
not
much
of
else
though
very
little
spice
for
a
winter
offering
decent
bitterness
to
round
it
out
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
d
pretty
nice
beer
i
expect
a
winter
brew
to
have
more
of
a
complex
baseline
and
a
little
more
excitement
to
it
overall
not
bad
i
think
this
is
a
good
brew
for
appealing
to
the
masses
i
had
this
beer
as
part
of
a
holiday
mini
tour
of
several
seasonal
holiday
beers
while
some
were
more
flavorful
this
one
seemed
in
line
in
the
general
taste
department
it
was
much
lighter
and
more
watery
though
which
makes
it
either
more
or
less
drinkable
depending
on
your
taste
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
rich
amber
color
with
offwhite
head
which
dissipates
no
lacing
aroma
is
of
burnt
caramel
and
ripe
fruit
flavor
of
toffee
pale
malt
and
burnt
caramel
finishes
rich
and
slightly
sweet
light
mouthfeel
lends
itself
to
high
drinkability
i
remember
when
this
beer
used
to
be
a
little
bit
bigger
badder
and
well
better
it
used
to
be
closer
to
7
abv
and
with
a
lot
more
brawn
you
would
expect
from
a
bock
todays
version
is
decent
a
good
pick
if
you
are
going
to
a
house
or
dinner
party
and
dont
want
to
rock
the
boat
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
nice
creamy
slickness
to
it
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
tasty
brew
id
be
very
happy
if
this
were
my
best
option
at
a
restaurant
12oz
bottle
from
clarendon
wines
in
boston
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
with
decent
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
all
malt
the
flavour
is
pretty
nice
and
not
all
malt
as
i
was
fearing
its
well
rounded
with
a
decent
amount
of
fruitiness
spices
do
not
stand
out
but
perhaps
they
contribute
to
what
im
tasting
im
pretty
happy
with
this
one
d
not
bad
not
very
complex
or
impressive
tho
either
i
wouldnt
feel
too
bad
wasting
the
night
on
this
but
i
could
be
drinking
something
better
d
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
ill
be
drinking
a
lot
more
while
sam
adams
is
still
brewing
it
this
winter
and
maybe
putting
it
up
for
the
fall
notes
a
decent
winter
warmer
that
leaves
you
expecting
more
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
mild
and
spicy
this
is
a
delicious
and
complex
brew
it
had
a
great
amber
color
and
a
study
white
2finger
head
the
smell
was
a
bit
muted
but
was
pleasing
with
a
fresh
wheat
smell
it
tastes
very
good
with
a
lot
of
intermingling
but
balanced
flavors
there
is
strong
wheat
a
bit
of
noble
hops
and
a
few
spices
i
cant
quite
identify
ginger
the
beer
featured
a
very
pleasing
and
creamy
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
it
again
and
again
i
stumbled
onto
this
beer
this
past
winter
2007
i
must
say
that
i
really
enjoy
it
i
have
always
loved
the
boston
lager
and
am
very
impressed
with
the
boston
brewing
companys
winter
offering
the
wintery
spices
really
make
this
brew
as
well
as
the
perfect
balance
in
my
opinion
of
hops
winter
lager
poured
a
dark
copper
with
a
big
frothy
head
it
smelled
sweet
with
hops
gingerbread
cinnamon
the
beer
tasted
like
it
smelled
malty
and
gingerbreadish
with
hops
at
the
end
this
is
a
very
good
brew
to
have
after
coming
in
from
the
cold
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
good
taste
and
mouthfeel
low
enough
alcohol
to
drink
easily
i
would
recommend
it
nicely
balanced
brew
i
just
wish
that
they
could
come
out
with
this
all
year
round
great
taste
and
good
warmth
makes
it
good
anyday
of
the
year
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an
average
head
that
laces
quite
well
smell
is
kinda
unique
malty
with
an
essence
of
belgian
yeast
maybe
im
crazy
some
fruity
aroma
as
well
taste
is
pretty
good
has
some
strong
malt
flavor
as
well
as
some
spiciness
to
it
not
sure
where
it
comes
from
but
it
doesnt
seem
hop
derived
another
good
brew
from
boston
beer
drinkability
a
decent
wintertime
beer
and
one
of
the
better
offerings
in
the
sam
adams
box
of
winter
delights
pours
a
an
amber
color
with
a
tannish
orange
head
smells
of
wheat
malt
taste
is
dry
pretty
hoppy
with
some
spices
hints
of
caramel
and
wheat
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pretty
drinkable
a
little
high
in
alcohol
for
a
session
beer
but
smooth
and
refreshing
a
nice
amber
color
on
to
pour
with
a
soft
and
kinda
stickey
head
has
a
nice
aroma
of
spices
and
what
seems
to
be
roasted
hops
maybe
some
maple
taste
on
the
drink
with
a
kick
of
hops
which
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
finish
is
a
nice
roastedness
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
added
to
it
a
nice
brew
some
the
winter
months
and
something
i
look
foward
to
often
sam
adams
once
again
proves
to
be
the
best
american
advertised
beer
brewer
from
the
winter
sampler
served
in
a
celebrator
bock
glassbubbly
somewhat
creamy
pencilpoint
thin
white
head
on
a
lively
amber
body
resembling
a
dunkela
flattening
malt
with
hints
of
wheat
and
clovefluctuates
in
taste
between
an
unsweetened
tea
and
a
heavier
lagersubtle
palate
early
with
a
zest
as
it
finishes
esters
produce
an
indistinct
yet
perceptible
fruity
finish
rather
smooth
overalldoesnt
rival
the
boston
lager
in
character
or
immediacy
but
as
a
lager
in
a
winter
mix
appropriate
crisp
and
clean
with
a
moderate
body
and
mostly
slick
texture
higher
in
carbonation
but
about
average
for
the
style
primarily
malty
but
still
nicely
balanced
and
slightly
dry
in
the
finish
a
well
rounded
and
very
suitable
winter
brew
a
nice
change
from
all
the
other
syrupy
uberroasty
winter
brews
drinkability
highly
drinkable
beer
for
those
cold
winter
months
good
session
beer
for
a
cold
winter
night
highly
recommended
drinkability
not
a
great
brew
but
well
worth
trying
very
good
seasonal
brew
dark
amber
color
with
a
goodly
sized
offwhite
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
lightly
toasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
to
it
tastes
of
sweet
malts
up
front
with
toasted
and
earthy
flavors
following
finishes
dry
not
bad
not
bad
i
could
definitely
knock
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
winter
evening
and
have
a
good
time
but
not
a
great
beer
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
month
notch
in
the
front
label
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
clear
ruby
color
with
slight
carbonation
and
lots
of
lacing
it
had
a
good
sized
beige
head
that
settled
into
a
thin
foam
the
aroma
was
malty
with
cinnamon
slightly
weak
in
strength
the
taste
was
good
but
not
overwhelming
followed
the
taste
with
malt
bite
and
slight
spiciness
mouthfeel
was
solid
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
really
have
you
thinking
of
the
next
one
dont
see
mysefl
buying
another
at
a
store
but
might
get
at
a
bar
if
craft
selection
is
weak
one
and
done
tap
changeup
d
this
is
definitely
in
my
opinion
a
very
drinkable
lager
while
it
may
not
be
the
most
exciting
or
flavorful
winter
lager
its
smoothness
and
maltiness
make
it
an
easy
pleasant
drink
definitely
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
day
to
day
drinking
or
with
a
meal
d
overall
a
good
beer
there
are
no
off
flavors
that
distract
from
the
overall
quality
i
continue
to
drink
this
at
the
bar
and
at
home
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
poured
a
clear
amber
red
with
a
thin
head
that
melted
away
quickly
aroma
is
malty
caramel
and
toffee
with
hints
of
cinnamon
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
just
hint
of
spices
mouthfeel
is
crisp
medium
bodied
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
another
good
offering
from
sam
adams
d
the
biting
hops
combine
with
the
light
spicyness
to
lower
the
drinkability
smell
is
malts
some
roastiness
and
sweet
caramel
along
with
some
cinammon
smell
is
pretty
thin
actually
the
malts
and
spices
are
there
but
they
dont
seem
robust
so
much
as
a
bit
aggresive
maybe
a
bit
thicker
mouthfeel
would
have
helped
carbonation
was
medium
and
nice
drinkability
is
okay
but
this
isnt
a
beer
that
i
would
help
myself
to
unless
somebody
else
was
buying
nice
brew
and
interpretation
of
the
style
doublebock
still
a
very
well
crafted
brew
and
worth
a
shot
drinkability
very
nice
well
balance
beer
one
of
my
favorite
winter
beers
come
in
the
winter
pack
or
6pack
d
this
is
a
very
nice
winter
brew
it
is
easy
to
drink
any
of
these
without
a
problem
its
a
shame
it
is
only
available
for
a
short
time
taste
is
smooth
malt
backed
up
with
a
hint
of
cinnamon
for
a
winter
brew
this
could
be
spicier
not
real
complex
just
really
smooth
and
really
easy
to
drink
ahhhh
cheers
and
merry
christmas
decent
quaffable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
for
the
price
i
can
find
dozens
of
better
brews
available
a
few
feet
away
overall
this
is
a
muddled
but
drinkable
brew
dont
expect
to
taste
whats
described
on
the
bottle
however
it
is
a
tasty
warming
and
easytodrink
brew
that
makes
for
a
great
choice
after
a
long
day
of
skiing
the
taste
is
a
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
a
very
sweet
camel
taste
but
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
finish
in
whihch
the
spiciness
of
cinnamon
and
ginger
dominate
poured
into
pint
glass
beer
pours
a
nice
shade
of
amber
with
somewhat
thick
head
somewhat
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
smell
was
very
good
very
complex
initially
i
noticed
malt
gingerbread
and
some
hops
i
swear
deeper
exploration
did
bring
out
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
some
biscuit
taste
was
somewhat
bland
dominated
by
malt
however
some
spices
are
present
the
cinnamon
seems
to
be
there
but
i
wish
it
were
a
little
more
pronounced
to
differentiate
it
from
a
basic
bock
carbonation
was
moderate
and
a
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
dry
aftertaste
overall
another
mediocre
beer
from
sam
while
i
enjoyed
it
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
it
out
on
its
own
not
a
bad
beer
but
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
not
a
particularly
complex
beer
but
worth
a
try
and
has
the
added
benefit
of
being
readily
available
just
about
anywhere
bought
it
for
the
season
great
pour
with
a
really
thick
head
that
laced
out
eventually
dark
amber
in
appearance
with
crisp
textures
the
smell
was
not
overpowering
but
explicit
wintry
aromas
mainly
cinnamon
breezily
texture
the
scent
the
taste
is
sweet
but
a
bit
watery
at
the
finish
smooth
and
light
in
overall
moutfeel
i
prefer
heavy
drinks
for
the
winter
especially
for
new
england
winters
but
this
boston
staple
gives
us
a
light
but
tasty
drink
for
the
holiday
season
cheers
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
copper
with
a
twofinger
head
i
didnt
get
much
in
the
smell
besides
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
a
very
tiny
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
pleasant
and
starts
with
smooth
malts
and
ends
with
just
a
little
bit
of
hop
bite
and
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
isnt
unpleasant
i
found
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
could
see
myself
reaching
for
a
couple
more
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
with
1
cm
off
white
head
that
is
mostly
lasting
aroma
is
light
only
able
to
get
a
hint
of
gingerbread
initial
taste
of
ginger
spice
and
citrus
hint
of
hops
balanced
with
sweetness
at
the
end
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
slight
lacing
alcohol
is
hidden
well
very
drinkable
beer
and
look
forward
to
it
every
year
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
frothy
off
white
head
that
retains
well
light
lacing
on
glass
smells
of
maltiness
and
some
hop
spiciness
taste
is
malty
great
balance
smooth
light
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
good
drinkability
d
a
good
choice
for
the
holidays
for
family
i
mean
your
average
beer
drinker
should
be
able
handle
this
with
out
complaining
too
much
d
very
easy
to
drink
several
pints
of
this
i
stopped
on
the
way
home
and
picked
up
a
12
pack
which
ill
try
tomorrow
i
was
never
a
really
big
fan
of
any
sam
adams
brews
until
i
came
across
this
one
this
is
a
truly
awesome
beer
that
is
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
all
season
pours
a
rubyred
chestnut
color
with
a
onefinger
head
that
lingers
for
a
bit
before
tapering
off
smell
is
very
complex
slightly
smokey
with
some
cinnamon
lemon
and
spices
flavor
strongly
complements
the
aroma
with
some
ginger
and
a
smoky
essence
that
really
makes
this
beer
a
pleasure
to
drink
wouldnt
mind
downing
a
few
of
these
in
a
single
setting
the
drinkability
was
really
good
and
the
mouthfeel
was
great
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
and
is
definitely
recommended
they
should
make
this
one
available
all
year
round
d
lightly
spiced
and
malty
with
a
nice
clean
finish
that
lets
some
of
the
spice
come
through
on
the
aftertaste
really
nice
much
more
drinkable
than
the
bottled
version
imo
notes
i
bought
this
in
a
six
pack
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
more
than
once
a
winter
because
i
just
am
not
to
into
it
its
a
good
beer
but
just
not
something
i
will
run
out
to
buy
had
a
large
glass
of
the
bock
on
tap
and
couldnt
tell
the
difference
between
tap
or
the
bottle
the
color
was
a
medium
dark
brown
with
very
little
tan
foam
the
smell
was
a
little
weak
on
the
roasted
malts
and
hops
also
the
taste
was
about
the
same
as
the
aroma
a
little
weak
and
lack
luster
not
a
lot
to
write
home
about
just
a
average
beer
that
had
nothing
special
to
write
home
about
couldnt
pick
out
anything
of
interest
just
another
average
ale
always
look
for
this
one
when
the
cooler
months
pass
by
poured
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
it
smells
kind
of
like
cinnamon
and
nutmegwith
a
touch
of
malt
characteristics
has
a
buiscuit
tastebut
you
can
definatley
taste
the
malt
in
it
this
beer
has
a
very
light
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
drinking
this
on
a
cold
winters
night
will
definatly
take
off
some
of
the
bite
of
winter
drinkability
doesnt
appear
to
completely
match
up
with
the
style
this
beer
does
taste
good
though
and
thats
probably
most
important
nice
little
hint
of
holiday
spice
too
on
draught
copperamber
color
with
a
thick
head
leaving
lots
of
lacing
bready
aroma
this
beer
has
a
thick
creamy
mouth
feel
the
flavor
is
malty
with
minimal
wheat
flavor
hop
background
is
slightly
bitter
but
hardly
noticeable
this
doesnt
make
me
think
winter
in
any
way
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
has
a
medium
body
nice
drinkability
not
a
bad
seasonal
but
not
something
i
would
drink
year
round
d
a
nice
bock
beer
that
is
pretty
simple
but
still
tasty
i
will
probably
buy
a
6pack
of
this
while
its
still
out
in
stores
just
a
good
solid
bock
beautiful
looking
beer
near
perfect
dark
bronze
color
with
thick
creamy
lasting
offwhite
head
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
like
ocean
foam
on
the
shore
i
smell
sweetness
and
roasted
malt
good
heavy
semisweet
lager
flavor
i
cant
detect
any
obscure
flavors
i
only
taste
good
basic
beer
ingredients
warming
going
down
thick
and
chewy
this
would
be
a
good
appetizer
before
a
meal
the
winter
lager
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
with
a
finger
foam
head
it
has
a
pillowy
head
it
has
a
freshness
date
which
tells
you
when
to
drink
it
by
which
is
nice
the
smell
is
aromatic
of
spices
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
the
taste
is
malty
for
sure
with
a
biscuit
flavor
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
hops
to
the
brew
overall
a
wonderful
winter
style
beer
i
like
this
sa
offering
better
than
any
i
have
had
so
far
still
sa
could
do
a
whole
lot
more
than
these
weak
efforts
seem
to
offer
drinkability
simple
and
direct
its
easy
drinking
but
not
engendering
much
excitement
in
my
breast
copper
color
weak
shallow
head
smells
inert
clean
metallic
taste
that
youd
expect
from
a
winter
lager
i
dont
really
know
what
to
make
of
winter
lagers
except
that
they
are
clean
with
a
metallic
twinge
and
are
expensive
which
doesnt
add
up
to
me
little
aftertaste
the
beer
is
gone
shortly
after
its
swallowed
id
probably
drink
this
as
my
2
beer
of
the
night
after
something
stronger
to
sort
of
reawaken
my
senses
with
something
strong
enough
to
clean
my
palette
but
clean
enough
not
to
leave
a
lingering
heavy
impression
would
buy
again
for
a
party
or
something
but
i
wouldnt
drink
a
12
pack
myself
of
it
drinkability
one
of
the
most
delightful
sa
beers
ive
ever
had
its
a
winner
overall
its
a
solid
beer
an
easy
one
to
use
as
a
go
to
during
the
winter
months
especially
when
a
tap
list
may
be
running
short
this
is
a
winter
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
every
year
and
it
brings
back
fond
memories
of
first
snows
and
a
good
beer
shared
with
good
friends
d
the
smooth
rich
flavors
of
malts
have
enough
sweetness
to
offer
body
but
not
sweetness
in
flavor
the
cinnamon
is
a
mysterious
flavor
that
is
perfect
sure
its
drinkable
it
is
also
quite
pedestrian
more
was
expected
out
of
this
beer
but
didnt
quite
materialized
this
beer
is
not
a
bock
but
more
like
a
watered
down
spiced
pumpkin
drink
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
local
watering
hole
it
is
a
light
brown
with
very
little
head
the
nose
is
spicy
and
malty
great
for
the
winter
season
like
a
malty
gingerbread
house
the
taste
is
good
it
has
the
flavor
you
want
in
a
winter
seasonal
beer
but
lighter
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
carbonated
with
some
slight
oily
viscosity
i
could
and
did
drink
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
uniquely
spiced
with
plenty
of
malty
flavor
with
a
slick
smooth
feel
certainly
not
top
shelf
but
a
noble
effort
from
sam
adams
not
a
bad
pickup
a
classic
winter
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
probably
second
on
my
list
behind
the
boston
lager
the
appearance
is
the
weak
point
of
the
beer
the
color
is
a
nice
amber
color
but
the
head
was
small
and
quickly
diminishing
the
aroma
is
malt
sweetness
balanced
with
christmas
spices
and
a
little
bit
of
toastyness
there
is
also
a
slight
background
of
hops
and
fruity
esters
the
spices
come
out
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
balanced
with
sweet
toasty
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
as
would
be
expected
with
a
lager
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
yet
forgettable
bock
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
if
offered
pours
a
light
amber
into
my
sam
adams
specialty
glass
by
the
way
thanks
allstrom
bros
nice
thick
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
a
bit
longer
than
expected
i
wonder
if
the
shape
of
the
specialty
glass
is
behind
this
apparent
anomaly
as
the
head
fades
a
spotty
lacing
is
left
behind
for
a
few
drinks
aromatically
there
is
a
very
faint
hint
of
spice
that
precedes
some
malty
goodness
tastes
of
sugar
syrup
and
sweet
malts
that
are
perfectly
balanced
by
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
light
bodied
yet
fulfilling
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
beverage
that
leaves
me
gratified
d
this
beer
would
have
gotten
a
5
for
drinkability
because
its
tasty
easy
and
refreshing
the
one
drawback
is
the
5
8
abv
witch
excludes
this
from
session
beer
status
bottom
line
is
this
beer
would
be
wonderful
23
times
around
especially
if
the
weather
outside
is
frightful
but
any
more
than
that
and
you
might
start
losing
the
ability
to
respect
this
particular
brew
d
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
good
seasonal
i
will
look
forward
to
this
brew
every
winter
would
be
awsome
with
a
spicy
steak
or
maybe
a
strong
fish
a
nice
malty
bock
with
a
touch
of
spice
great
fullbody
12
oz

a

down
to
a
thin

on

some

s
roasted

cinnamon
clove
vanilla
slightly

t
nice

the
spices
really
come
through
on
the

along
with
some
slight
bitterness
butterscotch
some
very
distant
tartness
m
crisp
refreshing
nice
robust
body
d
solid
winter
offering
good
drinkability
the
spices
are
very
nice
and
subtle
compared
to
some
other
of
the
winter
beers
like
harpoon
d
a
nice
malty
brew
easy
abv
very
sessionable
if
it
was
a
year
round
very
nice
drinkability
to
me
its
another
one
of
those
sam
adams
beers
that
i
couldnt
care
less
about
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
that
good
either
its
too
bad
that
i
dont
adore
the
taste
of
dark
roasted
wheat
or
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
had
this
at
a
friends
party
it
was
on
ice
so
i
gave
it
a
chance
to
warm
up
poured
a
yelloworange
with
minimal
head
despite
a
fairly
active
carbonation
the
aroma
is
unremarkable
a
little
spice
note
but
hops
are
definitely
out
to
lunch
theres
a
little
bit
of
malt
sweetness
thats
balance
by
a
light
spice
presence
the
spicing
is
done
well
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
any
particular
clove
ginger
or
other
spices
i
had
a
few
bottles
of
lakeshore
brewerys
winter
beer
a
few
years
back
that
got
relegated
to
beer
bread
duty
because
the
spices
were
so
overwhelming
not
a
problem
here
rather
lightbodied
but
not
out
of
style
for
this
lager
the
light
body
and
carbonation
make
this
quite
drinkable
and
the
spicing
is
subtle
enough
to
be
interesting
as
you
try
to
tease
out
the
various
flavors
for
winter
brews
i
tend
to
prefer
larger
ales
but
this
is
a
nice
effort
d
really
good
i
can
sit
back
and
drink
a
couple
of
these
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
freshness
date
clearly
marked
poured
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
left
a
bit
of
lacing
here
and
there
smell
was
of
faint
spices
and
the
taste
delivered
what
was
promised
lots
of
holiday
spices
like
cinnamon
cloves
nutmeg
also
wheat
is
very
present
very
malty
though
the
hops
make
themselves
known
energizing
carbonation
helps
against
the
dreary
winter
days
another
fine
offering
from
sam
adams
if
i
rated
this
one
strictly
on
the
bock
guidelines
i
would
have
drug
it
through
the
mud
on
body
alone
but
the
spices
and
the
holiday
season
makes
it
more
reasonable
and
acceptable
this
is
the
first
sam
adams
beer
i
reviewed
on
ba
and
im
sure
it
obviously
wont
be
the
last
but
this
one
needs
more
body
but
tonight
it
sure
goes
nicely
with
the
jazz
drinkability
good
winter
brew
hearty
enough
and
adventurously
flavored
to
satisfy
the
winter
brew
style
without
going
overboard
pours
a
rich
copper
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
and
leaves
a
thin
layer
covering
the
top
and
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
slim
hops
crisp
taste
very
little
bittering
with
a
smooth
mouthfeeling
nice
decent
caramel
malt
aftertaste
very
clear
deep
copper
with
an
off
white
head
that
doesnt
hold
too
well
and
leaves
a
minimal
amount
of
lace
smells
pretty
good
a
nice
malty
character
with
spices
nutmeg
clove
and
cinnamon
stand
out
and
a
faint
hop
character
as
well
taste
is
the
same
malt
and
spice
play
the
main
role
hops
in
the
finish
light
side
of
medium
body
the
spices
dont
suit
my
palate
so
well
but
this
is
an
average
not
bad
winter
lager
another
run
of
the
mill
brew
from
sam
adams
that
is
far
from
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
pick
this
one
up
on
my
own
accord
drinkability
is
quite
good
it
has
lots
of
malty
goodness
not
much
hop
presence
to
speak
of
goes
down
smooth
and
is
fairly
sessionable
did
anyone
else
notice
that
this
was
a
flavoured
malt
liquor
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
from
sam
adams
certainly
explains
the
lightness
of
this
winter
brew
the
spices
were
nice
but
t
still
feels
like
a
kmart
version
of
a
winter
brew
to
me
i
can
see
why
i
started
drinking
beer
i
never
really
looked
forward
to
winter
except
for
when
id
start
to
see
winter
lager
show
up
on
tap
handles
at
the
bars
ill
continue
to
come
back
to
this
one
for
as
long
as
they
make
it
drinkability
decent
although
i
probably
wouldnt
refer
to
this
beer
in
the
winter
i
wouldnt
even
consider
it
a
good
beer
with
so
many
others
out
there
that
surpass
it
dont
bother
revisiting
d
for
a
winter
warmer
its
ok
it
has
a
good
taste
it
worth
a
try
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
decently
it
is
not
a
stand
out
nor
is
it
something
that
i
will
try
to
seek
out
not
that
it
is
hard
but
if
i
went
to
a
friends
house
and
this
was
all
heshe
had
it
would
still
be
a
good
day
overall
nice
easy
drinking
brew
that
is
pretty
balance
and
tasty
for
a
xmas
offering
i
will
pick
up
a
six
pack
to
enjoy
throughout
the
season
the
winter
lagers
appearance
was
a
deep
reddish
colour
with
some
head
on
top
the
smell
had
a
combination
of
spices
and
caramel
in
the
beer
as
for
the
taste
slight
hoppiness
with
the
spices
converting
over
successful
from
the
aroma
light
carbination
best
describes
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
as
for
the
drinkability
a
couple
of
beers
in
one
sitting
would
be
the
best
approach
i
did
try
this
beer
with
pumpkin
bread
and
it
surprised
me
how
well
these
two
complimented
each
other
personal
taste
would
probably
rate
beer
a
bit
lower
overall
a
good
winter
offering
from
sam
adams
i
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
at
a
bar
while
watching
a
football
game
with
friends
and
between
the
6
of
us
this
is
all
we
drank
the
whole
time
everybody
was
happy
with
it
drinkablity
is
average
pretty
satisfying
full
taste
but
rather
rich
and
heavy
for
the
realtivly
low
abv
its
4
a
m
but
i
could
go
for
another
i
am
surprised
to
say
i
liked
it
and
would
buy
it
again
i
usually
dont
go
for
sam
adams
beer
but
so
far
this
one
has
impressed
got
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
bulldog
on
canal
st
the
appearance
was
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
the
aroma
was
of
toasted
malts
with
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
the
same
as
the
smell
great
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
drinkability
was
good
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
winter
session
beer
very
smooth
and
good
flavor
the
smell
is
weak
but
it
could
be
my
fault
for
being
sick
pours
a
clear
reddish
color
with
a
thick
head
and
not
much
lacing
smell
is
somewhat
mild
with
some
cinnamon
and
other
spice
aroma
has
a
strong
malt
flavor
that
is
balanced
by
the
spices
mediumbodied
and
smooth
an
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
drinkability
an
excellent
winter
session
beer
its
hearty
and
warming
but
easy
on
the
palate
and
remarkably
smooth
recommended
and
underrated
pours
clear
copper
with
a
medium
sized
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
spicy
with
some
herbal
hops
taste
is
sweet
with
a
lot
of
caramel
at
first
then
some
bread
and
spiciness
finishes
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
and
a
lingering
spiciness
nice
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
this
is
quite
drinkable
and
a
really
solid
and
good
winter
seasonal
good
body
and
a
great
mouthfeel
in
general
this
is
the
last
of
the
sixpack
that
i
had
and
ill
be
grabbing
another
soon
for
the
holidays
recommended
even
as
a
bridge
beer
for
bmc
folks
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
bock
style
it
has
a
prominent
malt
character
and
a
certain
spiciness
that
seems
to
fall
right
in
line
with
the
season
the
one
possible
drawback
for
me
is
the
somewhat
over
carbonation
other
than
that
this
brew
is
very
easy
to
consume
and
i
would
gladly
have
another
overall
a
very
nice
winter
brew
that
goes
down
easy
that
has
some
holidaytype
undertones
get
it
while
you
can
the
taste
is
also
a
little
weak
sweet
malt
and
mild
cinnamon
it
is
easy
drinking
but
rather
unspectacular
i
keep
swirling
and
sipping
the
beer
hoping
something
will
pop
but
now
i
am
at
the
end
of
the
second
bottle
and
still
nothing
average
drinkability
nothing
special
d
a
bit
less
than
what
i
expected
from
the
boston
sam
and
from
a
socalled
bock
but
still
flavorful
enough
to
drink
in
succession
without
gettin
bored
clear
reddish
copper
color
with
visible
carbonation
half
inch
head
dissipates
to
thin
layer
and
leaves
lacing
all
the
way
down
not
a
strong
aroma
taste
is
not
overly
sweet
the
malt
is
nicley
balanced
with
the
hops
sometimes
there
is
a
slight
taste
of
pepper
feels
just
a
bit
thin
but
a
very
drinkable
beer
ive
been
drinking
this
regularily
since
it
came
out
here
a
few
weeks
ago
i
am
not
at
all
tired
of
it
picked
up
their
winter
sampler
today
this
was
1
pours
a
clear
med
copperbrown
w
a
thin
tan
head
which
dissaptes
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
not
a
strong
aroma
a
faint
caramel
munich
malt
smell
w
some
nuts
and
hop
in
there
as
well
a
little
thin
on
the
flavor
as
well
for
a
bock
a
malty
caramelish
flavor
a
faint
nutty
undertone
too
a
slightly
alcoholic
finish
a
good
med
bodied
brew
sweet
yet
dry
good
carbonation
as
well
a
drinkable
brew
for
sure
i
could
drink
this
one
anytime
even
in
the
summer
one
of
my
favorite
bocks
an
excellent
winter
seasonal
good
warming
effect
poured
from
the
brown
glass
12
oz
bottle
into
my
straight
sided
beer
tumbler
a
very
attractive
mahogany
color
below
the
ample
dark
white
head
aromas
of
bread
raisins
and
clove
taste
is
of
very
nicely
balanced
malt
and
orange
peel
a
little
light
on
the
hop
the
recipe
varies
from
year
to
year
and
this
one
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
not
to
light
for
the
style
drinkability
is
very
nice
light
and
quite
sessionable
d
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
d
not
too
spicy
easy
to
drink
drinkabiliy
easy
and
does
justice
to
the
winter
label
a
tad
thin
but
overall
a
very
solid
brew
overall
a
pretty
nice
standard
for
the
winter
months
waiting
for
the
white
ale
to
come
out
it
seems
to
stick
around
for
too
long
however
as
does
the
summer
ale
not
so
much
a
complaint
about
the
beer
which
is
solid
so
much
as
sas
seasonal
greed
bahumbug
d
a
solid
bock
pretty
good
session
beer
too
i
would
agree
with
most
of
what
has
been
said
here
about
the
winter
lager
the
only
thing
i
would
ad
is
that
the
flavours
come
out
much
more
once
the
beer
warmed
up
a
little
i
would
recommend
leaving
this
one
out
on
the
counter
for
about
ten
minutes
before
drinking
d
quite
drinkable
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
night
it
has
just
the
right
balance
to
make
it
a
very
easydrinking
lager
but
also
that
extra
flavor
that
makes
it
sooo
much
better
than
a
typical
macro
lager
all
in
all
nother
nice
sa
seasonal
offering
this
is
a
really
good
winter
beer
it
pours
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
copper
head
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
really
well
it
has
a
rich
malty
aroma
with
hints
of
spices
that
i
couldnt
really
make
out
in
the
aroma
the
taste
brought
them
out
though
it
has
a
really
nice
rich
roasted
malty
taste
with
hints
of
hops
and
some
cinnamon
it
has
a
sweet
aftertaste
and
really
good
mouthfeel
this
is
one
excellent
winter
beer
i
definately
recommend
it
drinkability
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
seasonals
and
a
good
choice
for
my
first
bock
ive
had
doubles
but
my
first
single
definetly
on
a
lager
kick
now
and
im
looking
forward
to
more
to
come
specficially
sams
double
bock
definetly
starting
to
see
the
potential
everyone
sees
in
better
lagers
and
im
on
a
quest
to
find
the
best
mouthfeel
is
good
for
a
lager
drinkablity
is
high
cant
wait
to
get
a
sixer
overall
very
nice
winter
brew
look
forward
to
this
one
every
year
a
lightclear
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
fuzzy
light
tan
head
and
good
lace
the
aroma
is
clean
toffee
but
very
thin
hard
to
detect
the
complexities
that
are
to
come
in
the
flavor
the
taste
first
announces
raisin
and
nutmeg
and
more
toffee
malt
its
a
little
nutty
and
mildly
carbonated
fairly
thin
bodied
not
unlike
many
bocks
kind
of
winelike
and
even
a
bit
grassy
at
moments
pretty
drinkable
nonetheless
definitely
interesting
a
fair
amount
going
on
and
recommended
for
a
taste
not
your
average
bock
one
of
my
favorites
from
sam
adams
winter
lager
is
a
very
nice
accompaniment
to
the
onset
of
winter
a
good
bock
that
can
go
with
the
seasons
hearty
dinners
or
with
dessert
a
terrific
amber
color
winter
lager
pours
a
great
headreally
a
beer
with
a
terrific
presentation
the
taste
brings
out
multiple
flavors
with
mild
citrus
good
spices
such
as
ginger
and
cinnamon
and
a
strong
malty
flavor
it
finishes
well
and
is
easy
to
have
a
few
of
an
excellent
creation
from
sam
adams
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
an

head
that
dissipated
into

cap
the
smell
is
of
wine
grapes
has
some
woody
characteristics
the
taste
is
of
brown
bread
malt
raisins
sweet
with
hints
of
caramel
a
bit
buttery
i
dont
pick
up
much
in
spiciness
the
feel
is
moderate
and
very
crisp
finishes
smooth
and
balanced
though
perhaps
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
no
offputting
flavors
though
nothing
fantastic
taste
is
good
with
moderately
high
malt
impact
with
mellow
toasted
grain
and
mostly
clean
yeast
flavor
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
but
is
pretty
drinkable
this
said
the
mouthfeel
and
caramel
notes
are
enjoyable
very
drinkable
winter
brew
typically
i
look
for
heartier
winter
brews
but
while
not
necessarily
bad
this
is
just
okay
sam
adams
winter
lager
is
a
nice
american
take
on
a
german
bock
the
color
is
a
perfect
amber
with
just
the
right
amount
of
head
the
smell
is
much
like
a
nice
double
bock
from
germany
the
taste
is
full
taste
with
a
lingering
spiciness
which
is
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
strong
and
thick
the
drinkibility
is
great
for
the
winter
warms
you
up
when
you
need
it
medium
body
youd
probably
feel
a
bit
full
after
a
session
but
the
flavor
is
habit
forming
new
note
on
the
following
day
of
trying
this
i
took
the
bottle
out
of
the
fridge
and
let
it
sit
a
full
15
minutes
prior
to
pouring
it
this
beer
is
a
good
lesson
to
me
in
not
drinking
a
beer
too
cold
especially
a
bock
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
good
the
awesome
warming
taste
comes
through
more
and
this
is
just
an
all
around
awesome
winter
session
beer
assuming
its
served
at
the
right
temperature
overall
this
is
an
excellent
bock
another
work
of
art
from
sa
d
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
this
is
the
perfect
winter
beer
to
just
have
around
didnt
blow
my
socks
off
but
i
am
going
to
keep
this
around
for
sure
apart
from
a
hint
of
orange
ive
never
picked
up
any
spicing
in
this
beer
ditto
the
impact
of
the
wheat
in
the
grist
if
i
hadnt
read
it
on
the
label
id
never
have
guessed
it
all
that
being
said
the
end
result
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
drink
ton
of
during
the
winter
12
oz
bottle
best
before
april
2008
i
was
pretty
disappointed
in
this
one
i
seem
to
remember
this
being
a
lot
better
the
first
time
i
had
it
a
couple
years
ago
now
its
just
bland
i
dont
really
see
the
point
in
buying
it
i
say
give
it
a
pass
copper
colored
without
any
really
head
from
the
pour
and
the
little
bit
that
was
there
disappeared
pretty
quickly
good
taste
though
can
taste
hints
of
cinnamon
and
a
few
other
spices
within
when
it
first
hits
the
mouth
yet
it
has
hints
of
bitterness
mixed
with
a
bit
of
caramely
smoothness
at
the
end
but
not
sharp
and
on
the
whole
enjoyable
can
smell
a
bit
of
the
spice
and
even
some
malt
coming
through
it
well
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
enjoyable
on
the
whole
just
wondering
why
i
was
able
to
buy
it
already
seeing
that
november
has
just
come
around
but
hey
not
going
to
complain
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
head
aroma
is
light
and
malty
with
some
spiciness
very
smooth
as
well
taste
is
sweet
upfront
but
then
fades
into
a
nice
mixture
of
malt
and
spice
towards
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
even
detect
caramel
as
well
in
the
aftertaste
very
drinkable
bock
thats
perfectly
for
the
long
winter
months
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
good
flavor
seasonal
appeal
but
less
complexity
and
boldness
than
i
had
hoped
for
good
entry
beer
for
people
investigating
winter
brews
the
bottom
line
this
beer
is
nothing
overly
spectacular
but
you
can
do
much
worse
the
spice
tones
in
this
beer
are
if
anything
understated
so
it
might
be
a
good
beer
for
people
who
arent
into
the
spicier
winter
warmer
style
this
isnt
bad
though
crisp
relatively
easy
drinking
a
winter
oktoberfest
if
anything
d
despite
the
somewhat
heavy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
reasonably
drinkable
it
finishes
quite
clean
and
has
just
enough
carbonation
to
lift
the
taste
off
the
palate
drinkability
of
this
winter
beer
is
very
good
d
a
good
brew
from
sam
adams
would
have
like
more
spice
character
to
really
bring
on
a
christmasywinter
feel
easy
to
drink
would
buy
again
one
of
the
first
winter
brews
i
have
seen
this
season
cool
looking
bottle
overall
a
little
disappointed
here
its
not
bad
in
any
way
but
it
just
a
little
pedestrian
i
seem
to
remember
this
being
a
bit
better
last
year
i
dont
blame
boston
beer
though
i
wouldnt
want
them
to
take
any
glory
away
from
old
fezziwig
drinkability
very
nice
beer
by
samuel
adams
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
had
the
color
is
beautiful
just
a
simple
pretty
amber
the
taste
imo
is
not
as
rough
and
bitter
as
the
octoberfest
but
im
only
comparing
it
to
bottle
i
didnt
immediately
drink
it
with
food
so
i
didnt
have
anything
to
compare
the
smell
against
but
the
taste
and
drinkability
for
me
at
least
were
spot
on
i
will
order
this
anytime
i
find
it
on
tap
thats
for
sure
pours
out
nice
with
a
good
head
and
a
nice
copper
color
although
it
was
lighter
than
expected
since
the
label
says
dark
lager
nice
head
and
good
lacing
it
has
a
nice
scent
very
sweet
with
hints
of
spices
goes
down
smoothly
it
would
not
be
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
single
setting
excellent
taste
a
nice
blend
of
malt
very
sweet
initial
taste
and
hops
slightly
bitter
still
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
nice
little
bit
of
winter
spiciness
to
add
to
the
taste
overall
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
sammy
seasonals
and
a
very
fine
brew
from
a
larger
brewer
well
done
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
to
find
this
on
tap
in
my
house
this
winter
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
tasty
winter
lager
that
warms
the
stomach
and
is
not
filling
another
great
offering
from
the
guys
at
the
boston
beer
company
cheers
poured
into
a
pint
galss
it
had
a
deep
copper
color
it
left
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
as
for
the
spices
i
didnt
pick
up
too
cinnamon
or
anything
else
i
picked
up
roasted
malts
and
was
left
with
a
pleasent
doughy
flavor
very
pleasent
beer
and
nice
for
the
winter
months
pours
deep
amber
with
generous
light
tan
head
that
it
didnt
retain
too
long
thin
mouthfeel
with
proper
carbonation
and
very
smooth
the
ginger
and
cinnamon
used
are
evident
definitely
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
and
i
consider
myself
more
of
an
ale
guy
than
lager
guy
lacing
on
glass
was
medium
not
bad
not
bad
i
think
that
pumpkin
spice
would
get
tiresome
fairly
quickly
though
pours
a
beautiful
ruby
red
with
a
nice
head
and
good
lacing
unfortunately
the
appearance
is
the
best
thing
about
this
solid
but
uninteresting
beer
cherryish
aroma
flavor
is
sourish
somewhat
watery
cherry
spice
also
some
notes
reminiscent
of
a
watery
doppelbock
for
reasons
i
cant
explain
this
always
reminds
me
of
meat
a
decent
hoppiness
at
the
end
at
least
does
a
good
job
of
balancing
the
fruity
notes
up
front
little
head
forms
on
this
dark
caramel
colored
beer
when
poured
with
little
care
the
smell
contains
notes
of
caramel
soft
malts
metal
and
spices
mouthfeel
is
light
and
flows
well
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
malty
base
with
almost
a
fruit
aftertaste
create
the
palate
some
tinges
of
spice
and
a
slight
burnt
coffee
fill
in
the
cracks
d
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
bock
with
good
cinnamon
and
spice
highlights
a
rich
amber
appearance
with
a
nice
frothy
head
smell
of
dark
fruits
and
sweet
malt
taste
ive
tried
to
smell
and
taste
the
cinnamon
but
couldnt
mainly
malt
and
dried
fruit
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
that
goes
down
smooth
leaving
a
slight
dry
bitter
aftertaste
be
still
this
is
a
decent
flavorful
brew
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
d
one
of
my
favorites
from
sa
nice
flavor
this
beer
is
matched
up
very
well
with
its
season
its
best
served
in
a
cold
glass
in
the
low
40s
f
the
head
is
fairly
frothy
and
the
appearance
is
a
dark
golden
color
the
taste
is
strong
and
refreshing
with
hints
of
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
its
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
this
was
a
beer
i
tried
on
recommendation
and
spent
the
rest
of
winter
enjoying
it
supposed
to
have
cinnamon
the
smell
of
a
bit
spicy
came
through
but
nothing
too
powerful
like
most
sam
adams
it
had
a
frothy
head
its
suprisingly
smooth
and
flavorful
its
a
little
above
average
in
abv
but
still
very
drinkable
this
is
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
or
even
the
best
winter
beer
it
is
however
a
top
winter
seasonal
to
try
and
look
forward
to
the
taste
was
wellbalanced

and
maybe
too
much
so
i
wanted
a
big
malty
taste
but
thought
some
bitter
hops
came
on
too
strong
at
the
beginning
some
dry
roastiness
at
the
end
went
some
way
toward
redeeming
things
and
i
liked
the
fullbodied
feel
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
choice
for
the
cold
months
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
something
i
would
make
a
special
effort
to
find
though
meduim
body
with
a
light
feela
good
tangyness
very
smooth
and
drinkable
could
drink
a
few
of
thesevery
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
pours
a
dark
amber
color
i
love
the
smell
of
this
brew
very
spicy
warming
and
unique
i
know
they
use
numerous
spices
in
this
brew
but
the
cinnamon
stands
out
above
the
rest
going
down
its
rich
thick
and
hearty
at
a
random
trip
to
world
market
i
came
across
this
guy
sitting
on
a
shelf
all
alone
sam
adams
winter
brew
i
had
to
give
him
a
home
dark
wheat
malt
liquor
brewed
with
winter
spices
an
excellent
beer
by
sam
adams
that
will
warm
you
up
on
a
cold
winters
night
it
has
a
nice
copper
color
coming
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
small
but
adequate
off
white
colored
head
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
heavy
feeling

you
know
youre
drinking
a
darker
beer
it
goes
down
well
but
has
a
little
bite
at
the
finish
that
is
typical
in
most
sam
adams
brews
nothing
that
would
deter
you
from
having
another
onevery
drinkable
overall
a
very
welldefined
winter
beer
it
tastes
just
like
its
described
and
is
a
great
beer
to
greet
the
winter
season
one
of
the
best
surprises
of
the
holiday
season
hopefully
they
will
have
it
again
next
year
i
think
this
tastes
more
like
a
vienna
lager
than
a
bock
but
who
really
gives
a
shit
anyways
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
should
be
a
godsend
to
folks
without
good
beer
distribution
in
their
area
another
above
average
but
less
than
amazing
brew
from
smadams
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appears
a
rich
dark
copper
color
with
about
a
finger
of
off
white
head
smells
of
spicy
dried
stone
fruits
caramel
malts
and
honey
tastes
of
caramelized
sugar
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
lemony
hops
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
finishes
dry
and
mildly
bitter
a
nice
approachable
beer
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
outstanding
by
any
standards
poured
into
pint
glass
had
a
nice
red
color
looked
appealing
the
head
was
thin
and
disappeared
quickly
aroma
was
bitter
and
hoppy
tasted
of
dough
with
slighty
spicy
hints
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
not
to
thick
or
thin
fairly
easy
to
drink
flavor
and
mouthfeel
didnt
do
too
much
either
way
im
not
a
fan
of
hoppy
beers
so
i
definately
prefer
the
some
of
the
other
winter
seasonals
like
the
fezziwigs
i
like
it
it
is
very
drinkable
just
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
a
good
mouthfeel
i
think
winter
ales
are
becoming
my
favorite
types
of
beers
da
this
winter
season
lager
has
a
good
amount
of
depth
and
charechter
im
on
my
third
one
edit
2010
the
recipe
is
fruity
crisp
easy
drinking
but
so
different
that
it
obviously
should
have
a
different
listing
old
rating
stands
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
so
much
better
enjoyed
in
front
of
a
warm
fire
rather
than
here
in
the
airport
drinkability
much
better
than
the
last
time
i
had
this
or
at
least
remember
either
this
has
evolved
since
last
i
had
this
or
my
memory
has
faded
which
is
not
impossible
if
next
years
version
is
similar
i
look
forward
to
having
it
as
part
of
the
mix
12
again
the
mouthfeel
is
not
impressive
but
fits
well
with
the
taste
the
drinability
is
good
but
could
be
too
hoppy
after
a
couple
for
me
i
think
it
goes
well
with
food
though
and
could
drink
several
over
the
course
of
a
good
winter
dinner
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
with
a
crisp
finish
to
it
overall
im
impressed
this
beer
is
sessionable
if
you
like
them
sweet
poured
into
my
slender
cylinder
glass
this
bock
is
a
brownish
amber
color
with
a
slight
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
little
lacing
it
is
tough
to
discern
much
from
the
nose
slight
hop
presence
taste
is
warm
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
spice
at
the
finish
a
bit
light
in
the
mouth
and
not
too
complex
but
easy
drinking
not
bad
when
you
need
to
pound
a
few
in
the
winter
this
is
one
imo
that
tastes
better
on
a
nice
tap
than
on
a
bottle
its
not
a
great
winter
but
good
one
and
a
good
selection
for
a
wintery
brew
on
tap
that
is
easy
to
drink
esp
for
style
moderately
carbonated
and
very
smooth
warm
enough
for
sitting
out
on
the
patio
on
a
30
degree
january
night
in
california
but
light
enough
to
make
a
fairly
decent
session
brew
as
with
most
sam
adams
seasonals
id
have
to
say
its
nothing
spectacular
but
probably
one
of
the
better
draft
beers
at
most
bars
suffers
a
little
due
to
the
in
my
estimation
sam
adams
undoing
of
a
slightly
stale
aura
sometimes
quality
control
cant
control
production
not
much
in
its
sprit
a
bit
dull
at
times
not
a
bad
bock
but
boston
beer
co
didnt
take
a
lot
of
chances
in
terms
of
flavor
in
this
rendition
this
offering
seems
rather
static
and
subtle
compared
to
its
german
counterparts
pours
a
pale
amber
with
a
cream
colored
head
that
holds
like
cappucino
foam
in
this
pint
glass
a
surprise
aroma
is
very
sam
hops
are
sweet
with
the
aroma
of
unconverted
caramel
malt
sugars
and
that
familiar
aroma
of
a
wheattinged
doppelbock
but
cleaner
less
earthy
and
less
intense
than
a
doppel
all
around
this
is
my
first
plain
old
bock
so
doppels
are
what
im
comparing
it
to
taste
is
again
very
sam
but
with
a
sweeter
husky
backbone
than
the
standard
boston
lager
im
drinking
this
too
cold
my
buddy
had
this
in
the
fridge
unlike
the
cellar
temps
i
ususally
drink
at
for
a
fair
comparisons
and
it
needs
to
warm
up
once
it
does
the
wheat
is
more
detectable
and
it
makes
this
a
bit
more
rounded
ain
unique
though
its
not
light
years
away
in
taste
from
other
sam
beers
mouthfeel
is
medium
nothing
startling
here
on
part
and
satisfactory
overall
its
better
than
most
beers
i
take
a
chance
on
but
not
one
ill
be
crazy
about
buying
though
one
id
pick
over
others
in
a
generic
tap
list
of
note
there
was
a
twelver
of
this
at
a
small
mixed
gathering
i
went
to
and
i
found
many
of
the
bottles
left
on
the

tried

makes
my
heart
both
sad

glad
as
to
a
craft

some
sam
brew
can
seem
almost
macro
until
you
put
it
next

the

at

realize
it
really

even
close
to
being
tasteless
nonthreatening
swill
poured
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a

that
left
good

aromas
were
very
thin
and
a
hint
of
skunkiness
but
not
bad
taste
was
pretty
good
a
little
hops
up
front
and
a
nice
malty
finish
not
much
in
the
spice
department
as
the
label
suggests
but
whatever
not
sure
this
is
a
bock
but
again
whatever
a
decent
lager
worth
trying
but
not
a
standout
by
any
means
d
i
find
this
lager
to
be
more
drinkable
than
the
plain
sam
adams
boston
lager
has
more
body
and
taste
to
it
and
i
really
like
it
although
for
a
winter
brew
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
seasonal
taste
spices
etc
prost
i
dont
know
about
bock
but
this
is
still
a
nice
beer
its

i
am
consistently
surprised
at
a
brewery
that
can
simultaneously
make
beers
like
the
flagship
lager
and
ale
and
then
make
beers
like
the
cherry
wheat
this
one
finally
falls
in
between
i
neither
like
it
nor
hate
it
the
aroma
is
immediately
sweet
and
somewhat
attractive
you
can
definitely
smell
the
spice
it
pours
nicely
with
a
offwhite
head
to
reveal
a
medium2dark
amber
color
the
flavor
is
in
my
humble
opinion
always
a
bit
off
and
unbalancedive
had
several
sixpacks
to
make
sure
i
wasnt
just
tasting
the
occasional
offbatch
did
anyone
say
that
a
spiced
beer
shouldnt
be
hop
balanced
a
well
balanced
bit
of
malt
goes
nicely
with
the
spices
from
the
nose
crisp
smooth
like
a
lager
should
be
just
a
tingle
of
hops
at
the
back
end
remind
you
that
its
beer
very
good
and
while
not
great
a
fun
stronger
lager
for
the
colder
months
i
sip
it
by
the
fire
with
she
who
much
be
obeyed
when
im
of
the
mind
to
drink
what
she
drinks
they
flow
easily
and
tastily
she
looks
forward
to
the
fall
release
each
year
and
while
im
not
quite
as
atwitter
as
she
i
certainly
dont
dread
it
in
the
mouth
it
is
fluffy
elements
of
lean
woody
hop
tannins
coexist
with
raw
sugars
balancing
out
moreorless
dry
some
maraschino
cherry
and

fruit

not
a
holy
grail
or
anything
either
color
when
served
was
clear
irish
setter
red
no
head
to
speak
of
aroma
was
malty
taste
to
me
was
of
a
sweet
biscuit
mix
hops
were
nowhere
to
be
found
not
sure
where
the
spices
went
i
would
have
again
if
at
a
bar
where
this
was
about
it
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
but
no
big
deal
pat
john
this
is
a
brew
i
usually
look
forward
too
every
year
as
it
was
one
of
my
first
winter
beers
pours
a
crystal
copper
color
with
a
medium
head
lacing
was
not
significant
a
sweet
one
with
some
hop
bitterness
as
well
drinkabilility
is
good
but
not
one
of
sammys
best
imo
though
it
did
get
easier
to
drink
as
the
night
progressed
i
could
tell
right
away
upon
pouring
this
one
that
it
was
going
to
be
good
had
a
nice
dark
bronze
colour
with
a
quite
thick
tan
coloured
head
one
can
tell
from
the
smell
that
this
is
a
sweet
spicey
one
the
taste
however
is
even
sweeter
and
spicier
than
the
smell
seems
to
indicate
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
this
one
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
i
feel
confident
that
i
could
knock
out
quite
a
few
of
these
lovelies
with
little
trouble
ill
certainly
be
buying
more
of
this
medium
feel
and
very
easy
drinking
very
smooth
no
overpowering
alcohol
sense
might
be
the
best
easily
available
winter
beer
out
there
drink
it
in
the
same
session
as
old
fezziwig
and
you
wont
like
it
as
much
seems
like
a
weaker
version
its
preferable
on
its
own
color
is
deep
copper
with
an
sticky
off
white
head
that
trails
down
the
glass
aroma
is
definitely
of
a
spiced
lager
picking
up
citrusnutmegcinnamon
a
bit
of
wheat
and
a
slight
alcohol
scent
on
the
end
milky
feel
and
mellow
balance
of
malt
and
hops
nice
warming
effect
with
even
taste
of
spices
and
citrus
finish
is
slight
spice
with
dryness
a
very
interesting
take
on
a
winter
beer
i
like
this
a
lot
and
will
continue
to
look
forward
to
it
in
winters
to
come
winter
lager
has
an
easy
drinkability
and
a
pleasant
malty
flavor
its
a
nice
brew
for
a
quiet
winters
night
poured
a
crystal
clear
medium
copper
with
a
huge
head
and
good
lace
smell
is
malty
with
hints
of
vanilla
raisin
and
maple
a
bit
nutty
taste
is
just
like
the
smell
but
with
some
hop
bitterness
that
hits
last
fairly
well
balanced
finishes
a
bit
heavy
and
dry
good
drinkability
a
good
brew
but
could
be
better
it
another
example
of
sam
adams
trying
to
appeal
to
much
the
masses
insted
of
producing
a
finer
beer
that
only
those
who
truly
appreciate
would
enjoy
although
that
is
what
buisness
is
all
about
right
it
wasnt
until
the
third
bottle
after
my
taste
buds
had
been
taken
hostage
that
i
was
able
to
appreciate
this
beer
upon
the
first
sip
i
didnt
really
find
it
all
that
engaging
maybe
i
expected
too
much
from
this
contract
brewer
but
winter
lagers
presence
still
seems
a
little
onerous
its
got
a
great
appearance
and
a
heavenly
smell
but
once
it
hits
the
tongue
its
sticky
and
hollowly
bitter
the
alcoholic
notes
impel
me
to
call
this
a
good
beer
despite
its
shortcomings
but
as
a
seasonal
i
cant
say
this
is
something
ill
look
forward
to
every
winter
this
might
be
my
favorite
sammy
brew
had
this
in
a
25
oz
mug
wow
i
didnt
realize
how
hard
this
one
can
hit
you
copper
with
a
small
white
sticky
head
the
coloring
of
this
one
is
great
perhaps
because
of
the
clarity
aroma
is
sweet
with
caramel
some
orange
peel
slightly
alcoholic
with
just
a
hint
of
wintery
spices
this
beer
is
extremely
smooth
medium
to
fullbodied
starts
a
little
on
the
spicey
side
and
then
moves
to
the
sweetness
and
ends
with
a
slight
bit
of
hops
really
nice
warming
effect
from
this
beer
the
drinkability
suffers
on
this
one
only
because
it
is
so
unexpectedly
strong
amber
copper
color
small
white
head
smell
is
faint
some
ginger
some
hops
some
caramel
malts
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
thin
clean
and
mostly
of
caramel
malts
touch
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
ginger
or
citrus
too
subtle
on
the
spices
in
my
opinion
more
robust
in
years
past
maybe
amber
reddish
color
with
a
farily
decent
white
heead
cinnmon
and
orange
along
with
a
juicy
malty
aroma
smooth
crisp
tastewith
nice
malty
finish
spices
are
very
well
balanced
not
over
powering
slight
bit
on
cinnamon
in
the
aftertaste
very
good
and
drinkable
winter
beer
nice
winter
standard
possibly
a
conversion
beer
i
know
alot
of
people
knock
the
bbc
but
i
do
feel
this
is
a
delightful
little
concotion
of
thiers
oh
yeah
for
being
nearly
7
abv
it
is
very
smooth
with
little
alcohol
taste
have
drank
this
seasonal
over
the
last
few
years
on
tap
and
in
the
bottlewent
out
last
night
and
had
this
on
tap
pours
a
brownish
amber
with
alight
but
somewhat
sticky
headaroma
is
rich
and
malty
the
flavor
has
a
nice
flavorful
holiday
spice
to
it
its
a
nice
rich
tasting
brewthis
beer
is
served
at
alot
of
the
big
name
bar
and
grilles
wich
is
great
compared
to
most
of
there
other
offerings
a
beer
with
some
nice
spiced
notes
and
is
slightly
warming
i
may
have
sold
this
beer
short
in
the
past
this
is
damn
good
especially
for
a
lager
worth
a
second
look
this
beer
supposedly
nears
the
7
abv
range
but
it
really
doesnt
seem
all
that
strong
to
me
i
only
had
one
of
these
out
of
the
sampler
my
brother
had
the
other
one
so
maybe
a
sixpack
of
this
brew
would
help
me
distinguish
more
characteristics
here
for
a
lager
it
is
more
complex
than
your
average
dark
brew
but
this
one
would
be
even
better
if
it
were
a
bit
more
assertive
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
department
drinkability
a
good
everyday
winter
brew
has
character
and
interesting
notes
but
not
too
heavy
and
sweet
notes
a
mixed
bag
for
me
sweetness
can
be
cloying
if
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
it
the
sam
adams
winter
lager
is
a
beer
that
i
look
foreward
to
every
year
and
this
years
version
is
just
as
good
as
ever
the
beer
is
a
very
pretty
dark
amber
color
and
looks
great
when
held
up
to
a
light
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
hints
of
cinnamon
and
some
other
spices
the
taste
unlike
the
old
fez
is
a
much
more
balanced
beer
with
less
emphasis
on
the
spice
and
more
emphasis
on
the
balance
there
are
many
different
layers
of
this
beer
from
the
cinnamon
flavors
to
the
hint
of
orange
this
is
a
very
complex
brew
given
all
the
spice
flavors
this
is
a
beer
i
could
start
out
on
but
not
one
i
could
make
a
session
out
of
super
coppery
color
thats
pretty
deep
and
glowing
thin
ivory
head
that
fades
fast
lace
minimal
but
sticking
in
thin
ink
blot
patches
smell
is
more
sweet
then
spicy
the
spice
seems
citric
like
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
mixed
with
pepper
and
orange
peels
malty
sweetness
subdued
overall
with
a
burntlike
caramel
not
all
that
strong
but
interesting
taste
is
all
over
the
place
layers
of
different
spicyness
including
dried
peppers
cinnamon
curried
apples
orange
peels
did
someone
mix
the
fruit
salad
with
the
salsa
some
malty
sweetness
of
caramel
lingers
in
the
back
trying
desparately
to
keep
things
in
check
but
lets
go
in
quite
a
few
areas
a
mild
but
wild
ride
nothing
really
stands
out
or
is
overwhelming
feel
is
lighter
then
medium
with
a
texture
that
didnt
fit
in
the
carbonation
for
me
seems
creamy
but
the
smoothness
is
all
but
lost
due
to
the
carb
bite
it
tends
to
have
mixed
with
the
spices
not
something
id
have
again
really
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
subtle
but
complex
but
maybe
trying
a
little
to
hard
to
stand
out
have
to
say
i
was
dissapointed
i
have
had
this
beer
the
last
5
winters
it
was
always
excellent
maybe
its
just
my
changed
taste
buds
but
i
think
the
recipe
has
been
tweeked
for
the
worst
my
opinion
only
appearance
pours
a
ruby
copper
tone
with
a
massive
fluffy
tan
head
leaving
healthy
amounts
of
dispersed
lacing
aroma
nice
shot
of
pine
cone
scented
hops
initially
much
better
improved
from
last
years
winter
lager
this
is
a
rich
malty
lager
nice
caramel
sweetness
mixed
with
some
bready
dough
like
yeast
notes
and
an
undertow
of
spices
taste
full
flavor
syrupy
rich
nutty
edge
with
hop
bitterness
not
as
dominant
in
flavor
as
the
aromatic
qualities
with
the
bready
finish
characteristic
of
most
sam
adams
products
the
spiciness
bites
at
the
palate
nice
winter
lager
the
bbc
can
still
get
it
done
when
it
wants
to
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
slightly
syrupy
texture
and
a
strong
carbonation
does
the
palate
good
drinkability
glad
to
see
a
lager
around
7abv
this
one
can
definitely
be
sipped
on
its
on
tap
at
a
local
restaurant
in
morgantown
right
now
very
tasty
this
beer
has
a
different
label
now
no
more
sam
wait
hes
on
there
hes
just
a
little
sam
now
i
was
excited
to
see
this
at
the
store
since
id
never
had
it
it
pours
a
deep
copper
that
is
very
pleasing
to
the
peepers
the
smell
of
spices
ginger
cinnamon
basically
everything
delicious
it
has
the
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
hops
a
tad
bitter
with
caramel
cinnamon
and
spice
running
all
over
the
place
this
stuff
is
delicious
nice
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
not
thin
at
all
a
tad
sticky
in
the
mouth
this
is
an
awesome
beer
its
not
very
expensive

it
has

not

either
poured
a

clear
deep
brown
with
a
perfect
compact

the
head
seemed
to
last
about
a

before
receding
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
for
the
remainder
the
smell
is
very
malty
with
a
hint

the
first
thing
i
noticed
with
my
first
taste
was
the
explosion
on
my
tongue
sensory
overload
courtesy
of
carbonation
the
second
sip
was
a
bit
more
manageable
with
a
bit
malt
presence
subtle
hops
and
a
bit
of
spicyness
good
for
one
glass
but
i
dunno
about
the
second
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brownred
color
with
a
moderate
tan
clingy
head
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
of
moderate
the
smell
is
of
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
allspice
the
taste
is
mild
spritzy
malt
with
a
slight
clove
and
a
slightly
unpleasant
sharp
bitterness
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
winter
lager
but
not
by
any
stretch
great
the
odd
bitterness
seems
to
ruin
it
for
me
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
was
a
little
concerned
when
i
picked
up
this
bottle
of
a
winter
beer
once
spring
had
sprung
but
apparently
ive
just
gotten
lucky
poured
out
a
very
good
looking
dark
amber
with
a
nice
ivory
head
that
was
creamy
and
longlasting
the
lacing
effect
lasted
down
the
glass
a
nice
malty
yeasty
bready
aroma
that
increased
with
warmth
full
mouthfeel
and
a
creamy
sense
alcohol
noted
in
the
flavor
bits
of
hop
bitterness
jump
on
along
the
route
and
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
some
very
faint
hints
of
spice
peek
through
and
there
is
just
a
sense
of
crispness
in
the
final
finish
well
done
sam
pours
out
a
nice
dark
amber
color
a
nice
looking
head
eventually
dimishes
but
never
completely
disappears
tastes
pretty
malty
lots
of
spices
mixed
in
there
the
taste
slightly
reminds
me
of
their
double
bock
brew
but
it
could
be
just
me
great
beer
though
give
it
a
shot
pours
a
nice
dark
garnet
color
a
thick
tan
head
gives
way
to
a
thick
lace
to
the
end
of
the
beer
aroma
is
malt
and
spices
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
like
plums
come
to
mind
the
taste
is
a
roasted
malt
and
small
hint
of
the
spices
this
brew
went
down
smooth
and
is
very
drinkable
i
first
tried
this
on
tap
earlier
this
winter
and
was
disappointed
right
now
drinking
from
a
bottle
in
a
minnesota
late
march
that
still
wont
give
up
to
a
proper
springtime
i
cant
find
a
fault
with
this
tasty
delicious
brew
pours
typical
of
samuel
adams
the
smell
is
sweet
with
accents
of
yeast
and
wheat
this
is
a
very
malty
brew
with
a
thick
mouthfeel
goes
down
smooth
and
pretty
filling
i
liked
this
although
i
dont
know
what
a
winter
lager
is
i
think
it
supposed
to
be
like
an
oktoberfest
with
a
heavy
malt
taste
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
would
like
to
see
sa
crank
this
beer
up
a
notch
really
its
pretty
unique
in
my
beer
experience
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
spiced
dark
wheat
lagers
in
the
past
decent
but
far
from
a
special
weizenbock
or
winter
brew
at
the
bottom
of
the
sammy
collection
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
only
drink
one
of
and
is
entirely
forgettable
notes
to
me
this
is
what
a
winter
lager
should
be
loved
this
beervery
complex
loved
this
winter
lager
seemed
like
an
ale
though
nice
malt
flavor
with
spices
flavors
that
are
just
perfect
for
the
holiday
season
you
can
just
pour
you
a
glass
and
sit
down
and
enjoy
the
evening
i
cant
find
it
now
but
look
forward
to
more
next
winter
ive
never
had
this
ontap
so
i
was
eager
to
try
this
when
my
local
pub
added
it
the
healthy
offwhite
head
sat
nicely
on
this
deep
copper
colored
brew
a
good
amount
of
lace
clung
nicely
to
the
glass
for
the
whole
pint
caramel
hops
and
malt
were
the
three
strongest
smells
the
taste
was
nicely
spiced
and
sweet
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
at
first
touch
to
the
tongue
it
is
crisp
and
spicy
but
finishes
very
smooth
overall
a
fine
warming
winter
brew
that
is
not
fabulous
but
also
should
not
disappoint
there
was
almost
no
head
on
this
dark
brownchestnutdark
copper
brew
the
place
i
was
in
was
a
little
smokey
and
id
had
a
few
already
but
there
wasnt
really
much
noticeable
aroma
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
scent
but
nothing
dramatic
by
any
means
pretty
much
par
for
the
course
for
a
lager
without
much
head
i
suppose
it
tasted
fine
but
felt
watered
down
not
much
body
to
it
certainly
not
very
full
at
all
it
had
a
nice
caramel
malt
sweetness
going
and
it
was
a
solid
beer
for
what
i
paid
3
50
for
a
legit
pint
ok
but
i
will
not
buy
again
tall
head
in
the
glass
sits
atop
a
light
amber
colored
body
the
trademark
sam
adams
hop
aroma
is
backed
up
by
a
nice
mellow
malt
the
first
sip
brings
forth
a
smooth
body
supporting
a
crisp
caramel
malt
flavor
and
mellow
hop
spice
very
drinkable
winter
brew
and
one
of
the
only
guaranteed
decent
brews
on
tap
in
most
an
bar
locally
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
and
one
i
will
look
for
every
year
overall
a
very
good
wintertime
lager
seems
to
be
one
of
those
beers
some
really
like
while
others
just
dont
care
for
it
not
a
bad
brew
when
i
first
got
it
i
wasnt
too
keen
on
the
taste
but
it
grew
on
me
after
a
while
it
started
out
very
bitter
in
the
first
few
sips
but
then
mellowed
out
to
something
more
enjoyable
the
appearance
was
very
nice
too
it
was
a
golden
brown
color
with
a
good
foamy
head
to
it
that
lasted
a
little
while
the
aftertaste
was
wheaty
and
was
actually
good
with
an
orange
slice
i
like
to
try
things
like
that
in
my
wheat
beers
good
balance
and
full
bodied
without
being
heavy
enough
flavor
to
endure
all
evening
finished
with
the
spicy
character
lingering
for
a
while
and
combined
nicely
with
the
warm
fuzzy
feeling
from
the
alcohol
a
perfect
beer
for
the
season
impressed
with
boston
beer
co
s
overall
lineup
i
was
excited
to
try
this
my
first
sam
adams
seasonal
it
poured
an
amber
mahogany
color
a
small
head
with
good
retention
active
carbonation
and
tight
lacing
rounded
out
the
beers
appearance
a
sweet
malt
odor
dominated
the
smell
accompanied
by
a
hint
of
hops
and
indeterminate
spices
the
same
malt
presence
was
evident
in
the
taste
along
with
the
complementary
hops
and
spices
it
actually
tasted
like
the
boston
lager
loaded
with
choice
spice
and
maybe
a
little
more
hop
presence
the
medium
body
fit
the
lager
style
and
made
for
a
decent
mouthfeel
all
around
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
winter
lager
and
an
excellent
representative
of
the
sam
adams
line
this
is
really
quite
a
good
beer
the
best
winter
lager
ive
sampled
nice
amber
color
clear
with
beige
brown
head
that
is
very
steady
aroma
is
dark
rich
sweet
malt
that
is
close
to
molasses
and
pushing
cloyingly
sweet
but
fortunately
doesnt
get
there
superb
taste
is
a
very
rich
sweet
lager
with
dark
roast
flavor
despite
the
richness
one
is
able
to
take
big
drinks
and
enjoy
a
full
flavor
without
being
overwhelmed
not
necessarily
a
sipping
beer
spices
are
subtle
medium
fullness
and
carbonation
feel
without
excessiveness
overall
a
very
nice
winter
brew
even
warms
up
very
well
for
a
lager
seems
like
when
i
am
out
at
a
bar
and
they
dont
have
much
to
offer
i
can
usually
fall
back
on
this
one
during
the
winter
months
that
is
described
on
the
label
as
rich
hearty
and
dark
this
beer
is
including
nutmeg
and
cloves
but
this
one
seems
to
be
wellbalanced
drinkable

one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
beers
missed
out
on
it
this
year
and
am
still
a
little
depressed
about
it
smooth
with
prominent
chocolate
malt
flavor
love
this
brew
great
limited
beer
from
sam
adams
enjoyable
easy
drinking
beer
me
and
my
buddies
couldnt
even
finish
one
of
these
i
had
it
as
12oz
bottle
and
gotta
say
it
was
one
my
favorite
chocolate
beers
ever
i
just
wish
it
was
more
available
o
if
you
like
chocolate
your
going
to
love
this
one
and
it
is
a
fantastic
dessert
beer
if
it
were
available
in
six
packs
i
would
probably
have
it
around
a
lot
probably
the
best
chocolate
beer
ive
had
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
couldnt
drink
20
of
them
in
one
sitting
but
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
wind
down
with
in
the
evening
during
the
holidays
delicious
chocolate
notes
great
in
the
winter
a
lighter
stout
almost
a
borderline
ale
taste
its
on
the
sweeter
side
of
sweetbitter
notes
its
just
ok
it
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
chocolate
and
doesnt
taste
as
complex
as
this
beer
should
such
a
pleasure
look
forward
to
this
all
year
overall
has
a
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
very
malty
sweet
finishaftertaste
okay
for
a
change
of
pace
beer
overall
this
was
quite
good
im
not
sure
i
could
have
tons
at
a
time
i
feel
that
it
would
get
too
cloying
i
would
buy
again
for
sure
very
tasty
flavor
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
chocolate
presence
in
this
beer
it
is
almost
a
little
overwhelming
to
my
tastebuds
i
love
to
eat
chocolate
but
drinking
it
in
a
beer
i
find
myself
enjoying
only
in
rare
cases
other
than
the
chocolate
there
is
some
hop
bitternessbut
not
much
in
the
finish
and
some
roasted
malt
flavor
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
o
this
is
yoo
hoo
for
adults
nothing
you
want
to
do
a
session
with
but
like
a
lot
of
samuel
adams
specialty
beers
a
nice
change
of
pace
o
not
really
what
i
expected
but
then
again
it
doesnt
stray
too
far
from
what
i
expected
its
decent
worth
a
try
recommended
i
love
this
drink
it
will
be
missed
thankfully
i
saved
one
last
bottle
i
was
going
to
compare
the
2012
and
2013
but
oh
well
the
aging
didnt
negatively
affect
the
taste
at
all
and
it
was
just
as
delicious
as
i
remembered
the
malt
is
big
and
the
roasted
smell
and
taste
was
delightful
it
is
nicely
smooth
and
creamy
if
offered
ill
get
it
again
this
is
a
nice
chocolate
bock
from
sam
adams
although
i
would
like
the
taste
to
have
a
little
more
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
chocolate
this
is
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
drinking
all
year
round
o
a
beer
that
actually
delivers
chocolateoriented
flavors
without
coffee
or
char
that
so
frequently
comes
in
chocolate
stouts
and
porters
i
love
those
and
in
part
this
illustrates
why
the
bitter
bite
that
close
most
stouts
or
porters
is
needed
here
in
order
to
avoid
fatigue
one
of
my
favorites
i
realize
this
beer
has
been
replaced
with
the
cherry
chocolate
bock
which
i
have
yet
to
try
as
far
as
the
now
unavailable
chocolate
bock
it
will
be
missed
i
had
it
both
in
bottles
and
on
tap
and
the
chocolate
flavor
was
right
on
par
not
too
overpowering
not
bitter
at
all
just
right
i
looked
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
and
was
disappointed
to
see
it
go
however
i
will
withhold
judgement
until
i
try
the
new
variation
to
be
continued
i
suppose
excellent
beer
everytthing
i
described
in
the
cherry
chocolate
bock
this
beer
deserves
a
4
9
rating
but
i
cant
rate
beer
at
4
9
with
my
options
on
the
menu
but
not
a
bad
beer
one
of
my
favs
especially
when
i
could
get
it
but
now
its
replaced
by
the
even
better
cherry
chocolate
bock
there
is
a
reason
why
i
save
the
chocolate
beer
to
the
end
o
its
not
an
awful
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
have
a
ton
going
on
and
as
i
said
the
sweet
chocolate
flavoring
does
become
just
too
much
a
deep
black
with
a
medium
lasting
tan
head
on
the
pour
aroma
is
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
taste
is
of
dark
caramel
malts
and
sweet
milk
chocolate
flavor
a
medium
body
and
slightly
creamy
mouth
feel
on
the
palate
with
light
carbonation
finishes
with
a
sweet
dark
malt
and
chocolate
flavor
with
light
bitterness
overall
a
tasty
and
delightful
after
dinner
drink
recommended
age
fresh
i
took
one
sip
of
this
and
i
was
blown
away
its
a
perfect
marriage
of
flavors
the
richness
of
the
doppelbock
and
and
the
semisweetness
of
chocolate
while
some
samuel
adams
offerings
have
a
bit
more
novelty
this
one
has
more
substance
they
show
respect
to
the
style
while
adding
some
new
takes
on
it
wish
sam
would
release
the
big
bottle
version
again

as
the
name
implies
the
nose
features
huge
chocolate
sweetness
basically
tastes
like
carbonated
chocolate
milk
i
do
not
pick
up
on
the
malt
profile
but
perhaps
is
masked
by
the
loads
of
chocolate
flavors
way
to
sweet
for
my
buds
has
some
attempts
of
a
spicey
hoppiness
to
balance
things
out
but
way
overpowered
by
the
chocolate
highly
carbonated
and
a
tad
thin
compared
to
bocks
ive
had
in
the
past
could
use
more
of
a
hoppy
backbone
to
balance
things
out
definitely
a
dessert
brew
i
nice
one
to
try
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
again
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
not
overall
not
too
impressed
watered
down
and
smelled
a
little
funky
glad
it
wad
part
of
a
variety
pack
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
that
warrants
a
repeat
purchase
it
pretty
boring
and
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
to
it
maybe
if
you
drank
a
lot
of

a

youd
be
a

a

a

something

but
overall
just
something
average
really
o
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
it
goes
really
well
with
a
dessert
and
as
it
warms
up
the
chocolatey
taste
comes
out
more
not
bad
at
all
compared
to
other
similar
beers
out
there
o
seems
to
be
better
this
year
than
it
has
been
previously
overall
its
a
solid
product
i
hate
writing
those
wordy
tasting
reports
at
some
point
a
beer
is
a
beer
and
yeah
you
can
endlessly
dissect
the
overtones
of
malts
speculate
about
the
hops
the
temperature
of
the
mash
and
use
quirky
adjectives
but
that
is
not
me
about
50
words
should
be
more
than
enough
to

overallcomments
very
let
down
by
this
beer
this
is
an
original
concept
and
could
have
been

very

beer
but
everything
about
it
screams
average
consumed

classified

abv
o
a
nice
beer
very
glad
i
tried
it
a
little
sweet
overall
not
overdone
but
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
or
two
before
switching
to
something
else
i
was
rather
pleased
with
this
beer
a
distinct
but
not
overpowering
taste
of
chocolate
combined
with
a
tangy
wheat
flavor
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
full
bodied
mouth
feel
with
a
more
delicate
carbonation
but
still
a
good
beer
overall
drinkability
it
is
pretty
good
stuff
though
unspectacular
it
does
provide
nice
flavor
d
like
drinking
an
ubersweet
caramel
not
so
good
overall
a
mild
take
even
for
a
bock
yet
a
good
one
on
price
and
drinkability
im
not
a
real
fan
of
the
chocolates
but
i
have
to
say
this
one
was
nice
it
was
apart
of
a
sampler
i
picked
up
and
i
drank
from
the
bottle
from
what
i
could
see
the
very
dark
in
color
and
test
with
hints
of
chocolate
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
the
taste
not
as
bitter
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
paired
with
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
and
it
was
a
nice
replacement
to
a
glass
of
milk
bottom
line
if
you
want
a
fair
priced
beer
to
share
with
friends
this
is
a
good
choice
very
sweet
and
malty
with
a
foul
minerallike
aftertaste
and
some
odd
cardboard
notes
the
malt
and
grain
is
at
first
very
pleasant
but
ends
up
almost
being
a
drainpour
oto
me
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
impressive
i
can
taste
the
chocolate
and
thats
good
but
its
just
a
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
very
glad
i
tried
it
though
to
be
sure
overall
i
couldnt
decide
if
i
liked
this
beer
it
was
like
with
one
sip
i
liked
it
i
was
enjoying
the
aftertaste
but
after
the
next
sip
it
seemed
abrasive
o
overall
not
too
bad
but
not
great
id
have
again
overall
overall
its
not
bad
but
much
too
much
like
candymilk
left
in
the
bowl
after
cocoa
puffs
are
eaten
a
little
too
much
for
my
taste
would
have
like
to
taste
some
alcohol
rjt
i
dont
tend
to
favor
bocks
and
i
dig
this
perhaps
that
means
its
accessible
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
with
sam
adams
anyway
i
dig
this
but
it
isnt
something
id
get
outside
the
package
overall
a
less
than
impressive
offering
from
sam
adams
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
overall
impressive
actually
an
improvement
over
the
2011
batch
with
even
more
luscious
chocolate
over
and
undertones
a
delicious
dark
sweet
bock
thats
not
too
sweet
a
great
nightcap
beer
out
of
the
bottle
it
pours
a
dark
practically
black
brew
that
just
amazes
the
aroma
is
all
chocolate
mixed
with
the
hops
and
barley
with
a
hint
of
honey
truly
amazing
the
mouthfeel
is
by
far
now
the
best
i
have
ever
had
it
rolls
silkily
and
velvety
across
your
tongue
with
a
minimal
amount
of
carbonation
to
get
in
the
way
yes
very
good
the
taste
was
all
chocolate
with
barley
hops
and
malt
all
mixed
to
perfection
it
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
it
exceeded
my
expectations
beyond
belief
this
by
far
is
the
best
brew
i
have
tasted
during
the
holidays
or
so
far
any
time
of
year
go
out
and
getcha
some
and
enjoy
the
taste
was
nice
chocolate
notes
with
a
light
malt
backbone
less
overt
in
the
chocolate
but
still
quite
noticeable
there
were
some
burnt
malt
qualities
the
mouth
is
thin
nothing
special
i
liked
this
chocolate
bock
but
it
did
not
set
itself
apart
from
others
yes
overall
this
is
a
hard
beer
to
beat
o
a
very
good
beer
kind
of
regretting
i
did
not
drinkreview
this
one
earlier
but
not
really
a
summer
beer
the
very
distinct
chocolate
is
great
makes
me
want
to
try
to
brew
a
porter
with
cacao
nibs
a
great
addition
to
the
winter
variety
pack
i
need
to
check
the
store
soon
very
worth
trying
an
excellent
dessert
beer
oa
decent
beer
but
not
a
session
beer
by
any
means
despite
being
low
alcohol
its
sweet
almost
cloying
it
reminds
me
of
the
barrel
aged
storm
king
from
victory
but
like
a
little
brother
versionnot
as
intense
nor
good
o
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
needs
a
little
bit
more
body
to
match
the
malty
chocolatey
taste
its
still
tasty
for
sure
but
adding
more
body
and
having
some
better
head
characteristics
would
definitely
put
this
in
the
4
range
overall
not
horrible
but
not
that
good
average
bock
style
beer
i
have
always
been
a
big
bock
fan
and
this
delivers
as
a
classic
lightly
hopped
holiday
brew
if
you
dont
like
the
sweet
chocolate
taste
this
brew
is
not
for
you
but
for
a
cold
winters
day
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
o
impressed
i
think
this
is
a
better
beer
than
it
rates
on
ba
though
the
chocolate
is
a
touch
artificial
and
the
sweetness
gets
to
be
a
bit
cloying
by
the
end
as
others
have
said
this
is
a
good
afterdinnerdessert
sipper
and
definitely
a
oneanddone
for
me
othis
is
a
tasty
brew
that
is
a
good
after
dinner
dessert
beverage
marks
against
it
for
using
natural
flavor
to
get
the
flavor
profile
above
average
regardless
overall
good
choice
with
desert
this
beer
has
its
place
but
not
a
session
beer
for
sure
this
is
a
nice
chocolaty
brew
and
a
great
after
dinner
treat
i
usually
prefer
the
bitter
cocoa
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
and
the
heavy
body
of
stouts
over
a
light
and
creamy
milk
chocolate
brew
like
this
one
still
a
very
enjoyable
flavorful
chocolate
bock
o
unusual
but
pretty
good
quality
definitely
a
dessert
type
of
beer
o
odd
in
a
good
way
i
really
enjoyed
the
nuttiness
and
the
super
earthy
hops
the
hot
chocolate
powder
taste
not
so
much
still
a
decent
addition
to
the
winter
classics
pack
drinkability
is
fine
a
light
chocolatey
brew
more
so
than
a
bock
but
nothing
off
about
it
desert
like
which
for
me
means
one
is
plenty
poured
from
a
glass
into
a
mug
the
color
is
a
very
dark
yet
slightly
clear
brown
the
smells
include
chocolate
with
a
slightly
nutty
hint
to
it
the
taste
is
average
for
a
chocolatestyle
bock
with
slightly
overwhelming
note
of
bitter
chocolate
for
the
aftertaste
and
a
lack
of
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
more
towards
the
coarse
side
than
i
would
have
expected
or
wanted
however
the
chewy
feel
is
perfect
for
the
seasonal
overall
the
beer
was
nice
but
is
not
something
i
would
suggest
in
general
i
prefer
the
taste
of
chocolate
stout
to
chocolate
bock
but
i
still
like
this
beer
and
will
certainly
drink
it
again
it
makes
a
great
choice
for
lovers
of
chocolate
and
good
brew
like
me
and
it
has
many
good
things
to
offer
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
winter
warmer
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
nearly
black
with
hints
of
amber
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
immediately
fizzy
with
zero
retention
or
lacing
slightly
bitter
and
lack
of
carbonation
is
made
up
for
by
the
robust
chocolate
taste
borderline
flat
chocolate
stoutporter
style
i
didnt
so
much
come
away
with
the
bock
style
after
trying
this
this
beer
is
saved
by
its
flavor
but
it
still
seems
unfinished
still
enjoyable
though
i
would
recommend
it
you
have
to
admit
love
it
or
hate
it
its
original
the
pours
is
black
as
with
a
small
tan
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
a
little
bit
of
dark
cocoa
but
more
bitter
dark
malt
than
anything
else
and
a
little
sweeter
english
malt
but
this
is
a
dark
ass
beer
for
sure
the
flavor
is
shockingly
chocolate
forward
not
even
dark
chocolate
really
but
almost
seriously
like
a
milk
chocolate
bar
sweet
and
luxurious
tasty
and
tempting
dry
in
the
finish
sweet
malt
profile
but
the
cocoa
nibs
are
a
deadset
stud
in
this
brew
not
in
love
with
the
feel
as
a
little
moe
carbonation
could
lighten
things
up
in
a
good
way
but
the
texture
is
creamy
and
gentle
and
the
bitterness
of
the
malt
is
a
nice
contrast
to
the
chocolate
i
think
this
is
balanced
quite
well
and
its
not
a
slammer
but
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
no
problem
may
also
be
nice
in
an
beer
ice
cream
float
i
like
this
more
than
i
should
pours
a
dark
coffee
color
with
a
thin
mocha
colored
head
which
leaves
a
little
in
the
way
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
the
taste
follows
suit
nicely
with
a
roasted
malt
backbone
which
the
big
chocolate
flavor
comes
over
there
is
not
a
lot
of
complexity
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
overall
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
a
little
more
complexity
would
make
this
very
good
this
is
a
megasweet
desert
beer
that
is
in
no
way
offensive
but
its
almost
like
not
really
beer
i
was
snackin
on
some
of
them
dubble
stuff
oreos
and
was
like
damn
son
these
things
taste
bomb
together
check
it
i
would
drink
another
one
if
dkwon
didnt
drink
it
first
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
interesting
factor
they
definitely
didnt
go
overboard
on
the
chocolate
nor
was
the
result
a
cloying
dessertlike
concoction
the
chocolate
actually
gave
it
more
of
an
exacerbated
earthiness
and
smokiness
that
probably
wasnt
otherwise
there
being
a
lager
and
presumably
not
being
amped
up
enough
to
be
a
doppelbock
so
the
beer
was
rather
nice
i
still
used
it
as
a
dessert
because
it
was
still
sweet
but
it
didnt
lose
its
ability
to
be
a
beer
along
the
way
the
stickiness
of
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
much
especially
for
a
bock
but
whatever
so
it
gets
a
poor
mouthfeel
rating
it
still
has
some
stuff
going
for
it
my
favourite
part
about
it
oddly
was
smelling
it
when
i
breathed
out
after
drinking
it
its
distinct
from
the
aftertaste
in
the
mouth
which
is
actually
a
bit
unpleasant
its
like
an
afteraftertaste
that
makes
up
for
the
poor
aftertaste
you
just
experienced
but
still
a
naturally
earthy
chocolaty
beer
is
generally
better
than
this
o
pretty
decent
bock
sweeter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
o
completely
caught
me
off
guard
i
was
expecting
a
bitter
dark
chocolate
flavor
but
this
is
more
like
a
dunkelbelgian
dark
ale
mix
im
greated
with
dark
fruits
and
caramel
chocolate
comes
through
but
accompanied
by
strawberries
citrus
slides
its
way
through
with
sweet
malts
finishing
it
out
i
look
forward
to
this
beer
every
year
and
forgetting
what
it
tasted
like
made
it
that
much
better
this
year
o
this
is
like
a
gateway
beer
for
a
diabetic
its
sugary
substance
and
chocolate
make
it
flavorful
but
not
necessarily
in
the
right
way
sometimes
i
feel
like
we
experiment
with
flavors
so
much
we
remove
the
beer
element
all
together
with
this
brew
i
feel
like
the
bbc
removed
that
beer
element
and
replaced
it
with
a
funsize
tootsie
roll
o
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
nice
sweet
chocolate
flavor
the
problem
is
that
theres
not
enough
of
anything
really
not
enough
body
not
enough
smell
not
quite
enough
flavor
its
enjoyable
but
id
like
to
see
a
stronger
example
of
this
so
i
think
i
will
o
a
fantastic
beer
that
is
highly
recommended
immensely
drinkable
and
definitely
something
i
will
seek
again
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thin
long
lasting
tan
head
aroma
is
more
subtle
than
i
expected
but
there
is
definitely
chocolate
along
with
dark
malt
character
and
caramel
the
taste
is
very
good
sweet
at
first
dark
chocolate
right
up
front
that
fades
to
a
coffee
like
mocha
flavor
there
is
a
balance
to
the
sweetness
in
the
bitter
chocolate
character
of
the
darker
malts
low
carbonation
full
body
and
a
very
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
this
almost
reminds
me
of
drinking
chocolate
milk
excellent
beer
overall
brings
unique
character
to
the
style
while
not
straying
too
far
away
in
no
uncertain
terms
this
beer
is
delicious
conceptually
the
idea
of
chocolate
and
let
alone
in
beer
might
be
offputting
but
the
balance
here
is
prefect
and
even
if
you
dont
like
beer
there
is
enough
chocolate
to
please
any
sweet
tooth
perfect
on
its
own
as
a
winter
warmer
it
also
goes
well
with
ice
cream
a
hot
cobbler
or
strawberries
yes
beer
can
be
just
as
sensual
and
seductive
as
wine

the

in

the

rich

of

overpowering
mild

that
are
every

slight
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
for
a
chocolate

with
the
chocolate
being
rather
lighter

bitter

less

is
nice
there
are
some

artificial

my
favorite
element
here
smooth

the

leaves
a
nice
after

overall
this
beer
is
ok
i
had
it
several
years
ago
in
a
bomber
and
thought
it
was
ok
then
as
well
glad
i
tried
it
prob
wont
go
looking
for
this
in
quantity
but
might
be
nice
to
have
around
for
a
taste
at
some
point
down
the
road
cheers
as
usual
an
above
average
beer
by
sam
adams
also
as
usual
not
something
id
run
out
to
buy
but
something
that
id
have
if
offered
with
no
complaints
i
got
this
as
part
of
the
holiday
sampler
pack
from
sam
adams
i
wish
that
this
was
available
in
at
least
six
packs
as
i
would
buy
it
often
o
i
see
many
paid
a
hefty
price
for
this
one
i
got
it
as
one
of
12
beers
in
a
seasonal
for
a
mere
13
dollars
that
said
i
can
say
this
is
certainly
worth
a
bit
over
a
dollar
a
bottle
but
certainly
nothing
near
what
i
am
seeing
others
talking
about
overall
this
is
basically
a
one
note
beer
but
that
one
note
is
pretty
damn
good
i
certainly
dont
mind
seeing
it
in
the
winter
mix
pack
and
i
wouldnt
hate
seeing
it
in
6pack
form
either
overall
a
kind
of
meh
beer
in
my
opinion
i
remember
when
this
beer
only
came
in
the
large
embossed
bottles
around
christmastime
i
seem
to
remember
liking
it
a
lot
better
back
then
maybe
time
and
packaging
have
unduly
altered
my
perception
but
i
definitely
am
disappointed
with
where
this
beer
is
today
still
i
suppose
it
could
be
much
worse

flavor

overall
rather
simple

sweet
and
quite
filling
surely
a

only
and
lacking

bock
does
warm
to
offer
deeper
chocolate
notes
on
the
nose
from
my
standpoint
plenty
of
chocolate
but
not
overdone
for
its
style
which
i
am
not
familiar
withit
meets
its
label
discription
overall
not
bad
the
chocolate
is
nice
but
a
little
weak
this
is
an
old
bottle
but
i
imagine
it
would
hold
up
through
the
years

pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
khaki

thin
cap

small
streaks

roasted
malt
chocolate
syrup
and
milk
chocolate
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
thick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
bock
with
a
nice
chocolate
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
o
i
dont
quite
get
the
bock
connection
and
the
chocolate
seems
somewhat
artificial
the
buttery
aroma
and
flavor
does
not
go
well
with
the
chocolate
and
expected
clean
characteristics
of
the
beer
and
may
indicates
a
process
problem
if
this
beer
was
truly
brewed
as
a
bock
which
is
typically
a
lager
it
might
benefit
from
a
diacetyl
rest
to
reduce
the
buttery
component
pours
dark
mahogany
with
burgundy
highlights
modest
head
is
there
but
recedes
almost
immediately
nose
is
an
ambiguous
blend
of
mild
chocolate
and
an
indefinable
something
that
isnt
exactly
pleasant
i
wish
i
could
describe
it
better
but
theres
a
slightly
industrialartificial
character
to
the
nose
that
is
offputting
the
taste
is
very
onedimensional
it
basically
tastes
like
hersheys
syrup
in
seltzer
water
accompanied
by
an
unhealthy
dose
of
straight
sugar
theres
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
thats
about
the
depth
of
the
complexity
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
staying
power
of
this
beer
is
nearly
nonexistant
each
sip
is
more
overbearing
than
the
last
so
much
so
that
im
having
difficulty
finding
the
will
to
finish
the
glass
the
most
noteworthy
accomplishment
here
is
that
theyve
managed
to
make
a
chocolate
beer
very
underwhelming
to
someone
whos
easily
pleased
by
chocolate
beers
i
think
a
big
part
of
the
issue
is
that
the
chocolate
is
too
sweetmore
like
milk
chocolate
than
dark
chocolate
that
might
work
in
a
beer
with
a
more
complex
flavor
profile
but
as
the
backbone
of
a
beer
with
little
else
going
on
it
falls
flat
ehh
its
ok
not
too
exciting
brew
is
a
solid
drinker
but
is
an
average
or
slightly
above
average
overall
brew
very
unique
beer
glad
i
tried
it
o
not
that
good
of
a
beer
there
is
a
large
amount
of
improvement
to
be
done
o
more
and
more
chocolate
beers
are
being
brewed
these
days
sams
chocobock
is
still
good
but
the
competition
looks
like
its
going
to
be
getting
stiffer
still
wonderful
to
have
on
a
cold
winter
night
cheers
light
brown
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
tha
aroma
is
all
chocolate
malt
and
then
yeast
the
flavor
is
definitely
cocoa
but
the
roasted
malts
are
not
forgotten
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
lingers
with
the
flavor
of
chocolate
this
beer
goes
down
really
easy
o
much
better
than
the
now
commonplace
recipe
being
rated
under
this
category
even
with
an
abv
of
only
5
5
it
seems
to
have
aged
well
and
would
make
an
excellent
dessert
beer
if
you
truly
wish
to
experience
a
chocolate
bock
i
certainly
recommend
seeking
out
a
bottle
of
this
original
brew
though
it
may
prove
difficult
o
bad
execution
bad
beer
experience
tastes
like
something
bud
would
try
to
sell
overall
convincing
as
a
chocolate
beer
not
convincing
as
a
bock
o
the
master
of
the
craft
lager
strikes
with
an
interesting
twist
highly
drinkable
with
the
low
abv
m
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
really
smooth
poured
out
a
jet
black
color
with
a
foam
collar
and
no
lacing
smells
of
mild
notes
of
milk
chocolate
molasses
and
bitter
chocolate
used
as
an
accent
note
flavor
is
an
intriguing
combination
of
mild
roasted
notes
with
milk
chocolate
and
an
earthen
hop
garnish
texture
is
appropriately
sturdy
to
support
the
flavor
and
a
really
smooth
silken
texture
that
is
unfortunately
just
a
tiny
bit
undercarbonated
for
my
personal
taste
preferences
somebody
else
has
already
said
it
before
me
so
i
cannot
claim
credit
but
this
really
is
beer
and
hot
chocolates
love
child
in
a
bottle
o
it
is
as
described
a
chocolate
bock
pretty
good
nice
chocolate
taste
but
not
too
sweet
it
actually
goes
better
with
the
chocolate
flavor
than
most
stouts
and
porters
it
does
not
have
the
burnt
and
coffee
flavors
as
expected
instead
its
nice
and
smooth
with
nice
blend
of
chocolates
its
not
very
bitter
although
it
doesnt
have
the
off
taste
that
some
bocks
have
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
could
be
considered
a
dessert
beer
overall
my
first
foray
into
chocolate
beer
was
a
little
dissapointing
i
expected
a
little
more
chocolate
flavor
good
silky
mouthfeel
and
aroma
i
think
there
is
a
good
reason
that
this
was
the
last
bottle
from
my
winter
pack
that
i
hadnt
drank
in
my
opinion
definately
the
weakest
out
of
the
winter
pack
black
with
tan
head
warm
chocolate
and
fruity
notes
in
the
nose
taste
follows
according
to
the
aroma
almost
like
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
mouthfeel
is
great
right
where
it
should
be
for
my
liking
smooth
and
substantial
but
not
too
thick
smooth
interesting
enough
beer
great
for
or
with
dessert
appearance
is
a
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
thin
easily
dissipating
head
leaving
no
lace
smell
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
light
chocolate
taste
is
watered
down
with
flavors
as
in
the
aroma
leaving
a
roasted
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
little
feel
having
good
carbonation
overall
disapointed
with
this
one
samuel
adams
is
usually
pretty
good
but
not
enjoying
this
one
as
much
o
my
favorite
part
of
the
samuel
adams
winter
holiday
packs
just
so
sweet
and
enjoyable
m
low
carbonation
medium
body
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
chocolate
bock
great
job
balancing
this
beer
and
keeping
it
simple
i
love
the
creamyness
of
this
beer
and
will
definately
have
a
couple
of
these
in
my
possesion
overall
this
beer
had
nothing
overwhelmin
in
it
at
all
thin
body
chocolate
dominated
but
wasnt
very
pleasant
almost
seemed
like
drinking
chocolate
water
cheers
overall
when
you
are
in
the
mode
for
something
with
a
nice
smooth
sweet
chocolate
taste
this
one
delivers
quite
well
o
i
like
and
would
definitely
get
again
overall
a
very
good
dark
beer
one
of
the
best
from
boston
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
but
you
cant
get
it
separately
if
you
are
sharing
the
sampler
grab
this
one
early
and
leave
the
boston
lager
for
your
friends
a
little
unstable
as
a
whole
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
unfortunately
this
instability
doesnt
make
up
for
the
nice
dessert
flavor
the
beer
has
to
offer
it
comes
and
goes
and
leaves
you
wanting
something
more
hearty
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
just
couldnt
get
past
that
powdered
chocolate
smell
and
taste
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
isnt
overly
complex
but
still
pretty
tasty
it
was
very
rich
and
chocolatey
but
doesnt
go
overboard
with
the
sweetness
and
manages
to
not
go
heavier
than
a
medium
body
definitely
smooth
and
drinkable
i
think
this
beer
would
do
well
as
an
evening
dessert
ook
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
again
i
really
liked
this
beer
although
its
almost
more
of
a
milk
stout
than
a
bock
nothing
really
bocklike
about
it
still
its
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
dessert
beer
was
excited
to
see
this
included
in
sas
winter
pack
pours
thick
black
with
a
tan
foamy
head
that
dissipates
relatively
quickly
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
chocolate
roasted
barley
slight
hint
of
licorice
and
slight
hint
of
prunesraisins
taste
is
sticky
sweet
a
combination
of
fruit
and
chocolate
almost
reminds
me
of
raisinets
or
more
accurately
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
not
sure
if
i
would
have
more
than
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
good
beer
if
you
just
want
one
on
a
winter
day
or
perhaps
to
pair
it
with
a
nice
slice
of
german
chocolate
cake
overall
pretty
good
beer
not
the
best
bock
i
have
had
but
definitely
a
keeper
you
will
be
thank
yourself
for
purchasing
it
especially
when
watching
some
football
cheers
body
is
mediumlight
a
bit
thin
and
watery
compared
to
my
expectations
carbonation
is
ontarget
however
generating
a
fairly
crisp
at
first
then
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
most
comfortable
beers
i
have
come
across
just
another
reason
why
i
continue
to
come
back
to
this
beer
there
is
some
carbonation
but
it
is
not
too
tingly
it
is
all
that
is
needed
to
be
lively
but
it
doesnt
hinder
the
fluid
feel
of
the
beer
or
the
cooling
nature
it
is
like
a
spa
very
comfortable
o
ive
been
spoiled
by
the
other
chocolate
brews
out
there
the
last
two
this
one
and
saranacs
were
just
sub
par
the
quality
to
me
seems
to
be
where
they
are
lacking
it
literally
tastes
like
they
use
powdered
drink
mix
cheers
o
chocolate
bock
is
a
delicious
blending
of
chocolate
flavors
and
the
traditional
bock
style
very
very
well
done
i
look
forward
to
having
this
one
again
o
much
better
than
i
expected
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
the
finish
is
a
nice
contrast
to
the
initial
palate
this
beer
lacks
the
common
flavor
that
i
pick
up
in
95
of
all
sa
beers
which
is
a
good
thing
i
would
have
this
beer
again
overall
i
will
have
this
again
the
usual
sophisticated
sam
adams
product
not
such
a
bad
thing
when
dealing
with
candy
flavors
rather
sweeter
than
you
might
want
for
a
whole
pint
but
a
little
glass
as
a
curiosity
is
quite
tasty
a
pleasurable
beer
and
no
surprise
when
i
opened
another
bottle
a
few
nights
ago
my
wife
liked
it
o
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
in
the
winter
pack
not
a
beer
i
would
actively
search
for
to
have
again
but
certainly
one
i
will
accept
when
offered
o
i
enjoyed
this
not
especially
complex
but
is
tasty
and
a
nice
find
in
the
winter
mix
pack
overall
i
have
no
idea
what
to
think
of
this
to
be
honest
the
nose
is
lacking
but
this
is
unlike
any
other
brew
ive
had
up
to
this
point
i
would
say
its
worth
a
try
the
nose
was
also
just
a
weird
and
slightly
unpleasant
let
down
which
was
thankfully
not
representative
of
the
drink
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
not
enough
to
get
it
outside
of
the
winter
classics
pack
fits
well
with
the
season
and
i
cant
imagine
drinking
this
outside
of
winter
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
i
tend
to
get
a
little
overly
enthusiastic
over
dark
beers
and
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
a
little
too
bland
in
the
end
overal
this
is
the
one
beer
in
the
winter
pack
that
i
could
pass
on
i
love
porters
and
stouts
but
im
more
of
the
coffeeroasted
barley
flavor
fan
overall
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
its
pretty
decent
beer
o
i
dont
like
that
sam
adams
forces
their
boston
lager
on
the
drinker
to
try
new
beers
if
they
had
simply
made
their
holiday
pack
only
their
seasonal
brews
this
would
get
a
slightly
higher
rating
i
dont
want
your
boston
lager
i
want
your
seasonals
stop
pushing
it
on
me
o
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
was
way
too
sweet
for
me
the
flavors
were
pretty
straight
forward
and
this
made
for
a
highly
drinkable
beer
so
its
not
my
favorite
but
it
was
pretty
good
o
this
is
only
ok
could
use
some
roasted
malt
for
balance
best
part
of
the
whole
experience
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
labels
samuel
adams
has
yet
put
forth
at
least
aside
from
their
new
series
of
bombers
o
in
terms
of
being
a
bock
this
beer
fails
pretty
badly
it
is
too
heavy
on
the
chocolate
so
it
tastes
like
a
desert
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
is
akin
to
the
bock
style
i
think
that
i
might
like
it
better
had
it
not
been
billed
the
way
it
was
decent
brew
if
you
want
something
sweet
and
chocolaty
this
is
a
nice
non
threatening
dark
beer
heavy
on
the
chocolate
flavor
something
nice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
special
m
sweet
chocolate
overtop
of
sweet
toasted
malts
sweet
followed
by
sweet
topped
off
with
sweetness
just
too
much
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
and
pleseantly
surprising
as
i
was
unsure
how
it
would
go
when
i
saw
that
it
was
included
in
thsi
pack
the
only
downfall
is
that
it
is
super
heavy
feeling
so
1
or
2
is
all
i
could
handle
at
a
time
this
is
the
third
year
ive
had
this
offering
from
boston
beer
and
im
afraid
its
going
down
hill
this
beer
use
to
have
a
sweeter
chocolate
character
without
the
weird
notes
in
the
aftertaste
i
actually
laid
a
bottle
down
from
last
years
release
hoping
that
the
sweet
cocoa
becomes
more
dominate
as
it
once
was
could
contract
brewing
be
to
blame
here
just
saying
do
best
one
in
the
case
easily
good
aroma
and
flavor
tasty
and
not
over
the
top
too
much
although
id
probably
stop
after
a
couple
overall
i
did
not
think
i
would
like
beer
with
chocolate
but
i
enjoyed
this
immensely
its
not
something
i
would
drink
very
often
i
am
glad
they
only
pack
2
in
the
sampler
thats
enough
for
awhile
but
this
is
something
i
will
drink
again
o
decent
beer
but
too
sweet
to
realy
enjoy
do
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
and
really
enjoyed
it
for
being
part
of
a
massproduced
pack
if
i
could
by
this
by
the
sixer
i
would
from
time
to
time
d
worth
a
shot
okay
still
it
has
a
very
clean
finish
with
a
mild
chocolate
residue
nothing
that
mucks
up
your
palate
afterwards
but
it
leaves
you
thinking
about
chocolate
great
beer
for
anyone
looking
to
get
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
from
their
beverage
but
those
used
to
heavy
hitting
stouts
and
full
bodied
bocks
may
find
it
too
thin
for
comfort
drink
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
one
of
these
i
had
the
500ml
silver
wrapped
bottle
and
dont
remember
it
being
like
this
nice
creamy
chocolate
with
some
good
layers
i
would
like
this
one
again
o
this
beer
is
decent
its
not
something
id
want
to
see
in
a
sixpack
by
itself
its
great
for
a
holiday
mixpack
i
recommend
this
one
to
any
fans
of
chocolate
especially
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
wont
kick
your
ass
in
abv
just
a
really
good
beer
chocolate
and
cocoa
really
came
through
and
it
really
hit
the
spot
third
one
i
tried
cant
lie
many
beers
claim
to
have
chocolate
flavor
but
i
have
found
that
few
actually
deliver
this
beer
is
second
only
to
st
choklat
in
the
chocolatey
goodness
it
delivers
to
the
palate
doesnt
move
the
earth
but
tasty
and
drinkable
that
seems
to
be
my
conclusion
with
most
sam
adams
beers
they
do
a
nice
job
and
i
must
admit
im
really
enjoying
this
years
winter
seasonal
pack
o
very
nice
overall
a
bit
under
the
harpoon
chocolate
offering
body
could
be
bigger
and
room
for
some
more
roasty
bitter
flavor
but
i
enjoyed
the
drinkability
milk
chocolate
graham
cracker
touch
of
roasted
malts
there
some
bitter
coffee
towards
the
finish
mediumlight
bodied
very
silky
and
smooth
as
for
taste
sam
adams
rewards
drinkers
with
a
sultry
mediumbodied
beer
that
remains
true
to
style
while
adding
a
hefty
dose
of
cocoa
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
rounded
and
quite
silky
further
enhancing
an
already
laudable
product
noble
hops
can
be
detected
in
the
finish
which
offers
a
slight
bitter
edge
to
a
malty
profile
definitely
a
beer
for
chocolatelovers
to
seek
out
o
a
pretty
decent
beer
good
chocolate
flavor
even
though
its
pretty
light
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
the
sweetness
comes
through
from
the
base
malt
and
the
chocolate
flavors
dominate
the
second
half
of
the
palate
finishing
with
a
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
end
very
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
so
its
good
but
not
great
and
i
will
have
no
trouble
drinking
it
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
samuel
adams
offerings
i
only
drink
one
or
two
and
its
always
just
the
right
amount
this
could
be
a
great
dessert
beer
overall
i
almost
hate
to
admit
how
right
samuel
adams
got
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
would
do
some
major
damage
sold
in
six
packs
i
cant
believe
they
dont
because
it
would
be
like
printing
money
definetly
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
only
complaints
that
can
be
leveled
at
this
beer
are
its
relative
simplicity
and
lightness
in
body
o
plain
and
simple
a
decent
sweet
milk
chocolate
beer
overall
a
pretty
solid
chocolate
beer
flavors
arent
in
your
face
but
whats
there
blends
very
well
pretty
tasty
cheers
overall
not
a
huge
bock
person
or
even
a
sam
person
but
they
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
definitely
sessionable
and
a
bit
interesting
id
have
it
again
for
sure
overall
a
unique
and
different
brew
with
a
decent
flavor
profile
i
like
it
taste
is
chocolate
up
front
followed
by
anise
and
bitter
coffee
feels
full
and
well
balanced
not
too
thick
chewy
full
bodied
but
not
too
heady
a
very
nice
use
of
coco
without
being
sickly
sweet
or
tasting
manufactured
overall
not
too
bad
but
more
of
a
dessert
after
finishing
drink
than
for
just
casual
consuming
although
i
must
admit
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
seem
to
be
enjoying
it
so
perhaps
it
could
be
a
good
by
itself
casual
drink
nice
add
to
the
holiday
mix
but
not
a
favorite
as
i
said
to
the
missus
its
ok
wouldnt
rush
out
to
buy
a
bunch
of
it
but
drinkable
in
the
holiday
mix
anyway
the
beer
tastes
good
chocolate
as
advertised
but
nothing
else
really
i
am
an
irreverent
beer
snob
finally
get
a
chance
to
try
this
now
that
its
back
in
the
winter
mixed
pack
first
things
first
im
really
not
a
big
fan
of
the
bock
style
at
all
they
tend
to
be
my
lowest
reviewed
beers
this
beer
on
the
other
hand
is
surprisingly
good
the
chocolate
taste
is
very
present
but
not
overpowering
and
makes
for
a
great
well
balanced
solid
drinking
beer
great
mouthfeel
and
finish
still
not
one
of
the
top
beers
ive
had
from
sa
but
definitely
better
than
expected
and
a
great
addition
to
the
winter
pack
drinkability
is
great
for
a
chocolate
bock
the
balance
of
this
chocolate
bock
makes
this
a
drinkable
choice
i
was
greatly
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
if
you
are
a
brewer
and
want
to
brew
a
chocolate
bock
try
this
first
as
a
great
base
to
start
with
i
will
say
it
doesnt
taste
bad
and
i
couldnt
pull
any
off
flavors
out
of
it
and
im
positive
that
there
is
a
market
for
this
beer
i
just
dont
know
about
this
beer
od
would
make
a
good
after
dinnerdessert
drink
for
all
the
sweetness
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
but
not
my
favorite
overall
my
favorite
selection
from
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
moreys
bottom
line
as
this
beer
warms
im
starting
to
notice
the
chocolate
a
little
bit
more
but
just
as
soon
as
you
taste
it
that
cloying
sweetness
washes
over
your
palate
wiping
out
everything
if
it
was
toned
back
a
bit
i
could
picture
myself
really
liking
this
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
a
bit
syrupy
and
sweet
candy
and
choc
extract
syrup
like
tasting
like
they
made
a
light
beer
and
just
added
artificial
and
natural
chocolate
flavorings
drinkable
overall
though
o
a
nice
treat
for
the
holidays
and
infinitely
better
than
the
cranberry
lambic
but
i
hope
sam
adams
hasnt
settled
on
this
beer
to
be
a
permanent
staple
in
the
holiday
12
pack
o
a
technically
fine
beer
that
tastes
pretty
bad
all
the
same
if
you
like
chocolate
this
is
the
beer
for
you
me
i
poured
it
out
oagain
pretty
nice
drink
safe
for
people
who
dont
normally
drink
beer
o
a
tasty
beer
id
pair
it
with
dessert
or
just
drink
it
by
itself
this
is
a
chocolate
treat
of
a
beer
cheers
o
this
was
a
let
down
for
me
i
expected
alot
more
chocolate
flavor
to
put
chocolate
on
the
label
and
then
come
up
short
like
this
is
sad
othere
is
just
so
much
better
in
the
way
of
chocolate
flavors
in
beer
if
you
want
to
get
chocolate
in
a
beer
look
elsewhere
overall
so
smooth
rich
and
creamy
didnt
really
taste
like
a
beer
more
like
a
chocolate
afterdinner
drink
i
loved
it
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
little
holiday
surprise
recommended
edit
had
this
again
more
of
a
semisweet
dark
chocolate
not
bad
o
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
the
flavored
samuel
adams
beers
but
this
one
is
surprisingly
effective
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
but
this
bock
is
a
rich
sweet
holiday
treat
that
would
go
great
with
a
number
of
christmas
desserts
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
of
chocolate
bock
at
first
seemed
to
thin
but
as
it
has
warmed
it
feels
thicker
nick
d
this
is
a
decent
enough
chocolate
beer
the
base
beer
could
be
improved
in
complexity
and
depth
as
its
fairly
onedimensional
and
the
chocolate
tends
to
overwhelm
it
however
the
cocoa
isnt
really
all
that
rich
either
o
more
along
the
lines
of
a
gimmicky
beer
it
really
fits
the
bill
as
a
chocolate
brew
just
not
a
very
good
one
i
could
imagine
this
being
used
as
a
lure
for
someone
who
doesnt
necessarily
like
craft
beer
as
an
example
of
how
far
ranging
and
accessible
the
taste
spectrum
goes
ill
save
the
other
one
from
the
winter
pack
for
someone
who
doesnt
like
beer
to
say
hey
i
know
you
dont
like
beer
but
i
know
you
like
cocoa
crispies
in
chocolate
milk
try
this
o
if
youre
a
fan
of
milk
chocolate
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
bit
too
chocolatey
in
spots
to
the
point
where
it
seems
over
the
top
but
a
good
seasonal
xmas
time
beer
as
it
fits
in
with
the
holidays
overall
a
decent
novelty
beer
but
it
seems
like
most
chocolate
beers
seem
to
focus
on
the
chocolate
and
forget
about
the
beer
this
one
follows
that
trend
d
a
decent
beer
to
mix
in
with
the
winter
mixed
case
this
year
and
it
will
satisfy
the
sweet
tooth
of
many
especially
a
chocolate
and
beer
lover
a
touch
syrupy
to
have
a
few
in
a
row
is
its
main
downfall
overall
impression
now
this
is
a
beer
i
could
enjoy
from
time
to
time
its
very
flavorful
and
with
an
accommodating
abv
to
match
im
very
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
oreally
good
alot
better
than
i
thought
getting
better
as
i
drink
it
this
will
satisfy
your
sweet
tooth
i
think
well
done
sam
kudos
o
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
bock
there
is
more
chocolate
taste
than
i
expected
i
wish
this
was
available
in
a
six
pack
pours
dark
brown
body
and
a
tan
head
smell
of
milk
chocolate
very
one
dimensional
milk
chocolate
kind
of
like
malted
milk
balls
taste
reflects
the
smell
medium
body
i
dont
know
about
the
bock
aspect
of
this
i
have
to
say
that
as
with
many
sa
offerings
it
delivers
as
expected
not
a
bad
offering
good
with
something
else
dr
why
is
the
abv
so
low
while
as
a
bock
its
strange
it
works
an
innovative
beer
with
a
troublesome
third
act
everyone
should
try
this
to
experience
chocolate
properly
done
id
love
to
have
this
on
draught
or
nitrodraught
getting
clowing
on
the
tongue
and
throat
not
a
bad
sipper
but
for
me
id
have
to
look
elsewhere
for
a
bock
that
i
really
liked
b
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
but
it
really
could
be
done
better
maybe
a
higher
malt
load
to
boost
the
body
or
a
different
hop
variety
to
reduce
the
sense
of
meat
in
the
nose
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
transparency
out
of
the
bottle
but
settles
into
a
dark
brown
to
semi
black
color
with
ruby
hues
when
held
to
the
light
it
has
a
nice
1
tan
head
that
laces
the
glass
adequately
it
smells
of
heavy
bread
like
malts
and
toffee
the
taste
is
straight
up
chocolate
here
front
middle
and
finish
chocolate
its
silky
smooth
and
carbonated
well
i
think
this
is
more
suited
for
chicks
in
the
winter
time
12
oz
is
about
all
i
could
handle
of
this
stuff
a
descent
enough
drink
but
nothing
more
than
chocolate
and
bock
easy
to
drink
and
smooth
i
just
wish
there
was
a
little
more
to
it
o
not
bad
but
definitely
not
great
either
i
really
want
bbc
to
make
a
six
pack
of
the
black
and
brew
but
eh
this
stuff
can
stay
in
the
winter
variety
pack
for
all
i
care
ah
well
worth
a
try
anyways
o
decent
but
would
never
buy
this
as
a
6
pack
or
individual
bottle
for
that
matter
it
is
fine
where
it
is
as
a
novelty
in
a
variety
pack
o
not
something
i
would
care
to
have
again
i
didnt
have
particularly
high
expectations
for
it
and
it
fell
short
of
them
o
not
a
complex
beer
by
any
means
and
not
especially
chocolatey
a
decent
drinkable
beer
for
sams
standards
though
i
wasnt
expecting
curator
or
celebrator
but
sam
adams
should
have
been
able
to
achieve
something
close
even
a
richer
heftier
version
of
their
winter
lager
wouldve
been
sufficient
for
introducing
americans
to
this
style
of
the
beer
way
to
shit
the
bed
guys
overall
an
okay
beer
thats
best
use
would
probably
be
to
introduce
people
to
craft
o
good
beer
i
was
a
little
shocked
i
was
expecting
an
oversweet
concoction
but
was
pleased
with
this
taste
is
weak
though
and
the
appearance
especially
leaves
more
to
be
desired
o
not
the
typical
bock
its
almost
like
drinking
hot
chocolate
after
its
been
in
the
fridge
it
is
pretty
tasty
and
worth
a
try
o
bread
and
cocoa
simply
put
overall
the
flavors
seem
rather
synthetic
pepto
flavor
is
off
putting
easy
drinking
and
a
good
effort
from
sa
a
decent
beer
that
paired
beyond
amazing
with
some
pumpkin
pie
overall
though
it
stands
alone
just
ok
not
bad
but
i
would
rather
go
with
a
chocolate
stout
thanks
again
dave
for
this
one
poured
stout
black
with
red
highlights
beige
head
was
tall
and
stuck
around
for
a
bit
smell
is
all
malt
with
chocolate
and
caramel
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
with
some
malt
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
i
liked
it
id
have
it
again
but
with
desert
next
time
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
bbc
but
this
one
borders
on
really
good
the
sweet
chocolate
malts
and
belgian
hops
and
or
malts
really
meld
great
together
if
you
have
a
chance
to
grab
a
winter
sampler
pack
do
o
like
it
dont
love
it
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
but
pretty
good
o
not
a
bad
beer
decent
for
its
style
but
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
o
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
be
happy
to
have
another
for
dessert
o
good
beer
very
sweet
though
bittersweet
cocoa
flavors
toasty
in
the
middle
some
notes
of
marshmallow
creme
and
nutella
something
about
it
is
a
little
onedimensional
but
its
pleasant
enough
to
drink
light
bodied
and
smooth
not
bad
maybe
not
the
most
rich
when
it
comes
to
chocolate
infused
beers
but
sometimes
less
is
more
in
this
case
overall
great
tasting
beer
i
wish
they
sold
this
year
round
and
by
the
case
i
love
the
chocolate
flavor
overall
its
too
one
dimensional
high
on
cocoa
and
chocolate
with
roasterd
malts
thats
all
for
a
desert
beer
i
can
think
of
alot
better
ones
out
there
good
beer
to
hand
someone
that
hates
beer
d
i
would
gladly
purchase
this
again
it
feels
and
tastes
great
in
the
mouth
and
really
walks
the
line
with
the
bock
character
and
chocolate
both
balancing
12
oz
bottle
as
part
of
a
samuel
adams
holiday
pack
appearance
is
promising
but
ultimately
this
beer
is
just
too
gimicky
for
me
and
way
too
sweet
luckily
there
are
only
two
of
them
in
this
12
pack
and
ill
give
the
other
one
to
a
friend
lots
of
chocolate
here
the
bock
character
itself
isnt
bad
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
i
guess
im
not
sorry
i
tried
it
but
wouldnt
ever
buy
it
on
its
own
this
beer
hits
me
in
my
sweet
tooth
i
like
desert
beers
this
ones
pretty
good
o
confused
by
the
bock
label
as
it
then
goes
on
to
say
ale
with
cocoa
and
natural
flavors
i
though
a
bock
beir
was
a
lager
this
is
definately
not
a
lager
like
bock
so
why
the
label
i
digress
overall
i
enjoyed
the
trial
decent
but
too
much
chocolate
for
the
style
will
not
be
buying
this
again
ready
to
move
on
hopefully
next
year
sa
will
switch
these
out
for
other
styles
i
miss
the
lambic
o
as
a
once
in
a
while
dessert
beer
i
can
see
this
being
part
of
the
mix
which
makes
it
a
good
two
beer
in
a
twelve
pack
mix
selection
part
of
the
sa
winter
mix
non
fans
of
cocoa
pebbles
should
steer
clear
o
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
could
easily
see
this
providing
sustenance
for
lenten
fasts
like
the
black
and
brew
from
the
winter
pack
i
wish
they
would
offer
this
one
on
its
own
pours
jet
black
with
a
one
finger
head
that
disapates
quickly
into
nothing
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
taste
follows
the
nose
but
with
chocolate
as
the
star
a
bit
sweet
but
not
crazy
this
is
tasty
a
good
dessert
beer
but
not
a
more
than
one
beer
quite
chocolatey
but
thats
it
and
its
not
as
nice
as
it
might
have
been
o
nice
but
overall
too
sweet
too
much
carbonation
and
too
much
boston
lager
traits
making
it
taste
nearly
like
a
macrooffering
overall
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
sweetness
in
beer
and
this
is
definitely
a
sweet
beer
but
not
overly
so
drinking
this
at
5060
definitely
brings
out
the
fruit
flavors
and
sweetens
the
chocolate
drinking
this
at
40
will
darken
the
chocolate
but
you
might
miss
the
complexity
of
dark
fruits
unique
for
sure
i
like
this
but
probly
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
of
white
foam
that
recedes
within
seconds
into
nothing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
but
is
quite
faint
the
taste
is
considerably
stronger
than
the
aroma
with
a
more
pronounced
chocolate
character
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
aggressively
sharp
carbonation
and
a
watery
texture
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
will
pass
on
next
time
pours
black
with
a
brown
edge
and
a
very
light
tanish
head
that
fades
and
clings
the
nose
is
pretty
big
of
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
milk
chocolate
and
really
quite
a
bit
of
vanilla
which
i
love
and
always
enjoy
in
a
beer
the
feel
is
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
from
their
winter
pack
im
a
big
fan
of
vanilla
and
pick
up
quite
a
bit
in
this
beer
d
this
is
really
well
done
and
quite
simple
for
what
it
is
a
very
intense
chocolate
lager
dont
look
for
much
else
here
overall
a
good
brew
part
of
a
great
winter
variety
pack
would
drink
again
overall
pretty
damn
good
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
i
just
wish
there
was
a
tad
bit
more
chocolatecocoa
taste
to
it
very
dark
brown
with
rubypurple
highlights
and
a
thin
cap
of
fine
tanbeige
bubbles
mild
aroma
a
little
bit
of
dry
cocoa
mild
caramel
and
chocolate
milk
chocolate
dominates
the
flavour
sweet
with
mild
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
sugary
caramel
in
the
finish
along
with
a
spicy
alcohol
and
slightly
burnt
sugar
character
mild
grainy
texture
and
flavour
medium
bodied
with
mediumlow
carbonation
it
tastes
alright
but
its
a
bit
cloying
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
o
a
solid
beer
and
great
contribution
to
the
sa
winter
pack
super
dark
chestnut
hue
under
a
small
loosely
creamy
head
aromas
of
toffee
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
a
fine
dusting
of
dark
cocoa
sweetness
that
increases
as
it
warms
significantly
more
chocolate
in
the
flavor
caramel
vanilla
bean
and
some
nuttiness
silky
smooth
medium
body
not
bad
i
think
after
one
id
be
ready
to
move
on
before
it
gets
too
cloying
but
not
bad
this
could
easily
be
called
rum
raisin
bran
bock
and
it
would
pass
i
have
a
feeling
youll
either
really
like
this
one
or
absolutely
hate
it
o
this
beer
seems
to
receive
a
bad
reputation
for
being
out
of
style
and
a
bit
one
dimensional
however
i
do
rather
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
it
may
not
scream
bock
to
me
but
the
chocolate
is
well
done
in
a
very
sweet
fashion
and
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
alternative
to
a
heavier
chocolate
stout
overall
drinkability
is
high
not
very
complex
good
chocolate
flavor
pretty
good
overall
different
for
sure
good
flavor
feel
and
balance
o
the
brew
is
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
is
nice
and
easy
to
drink
probably
wont
buy
it
again
ill
pass
on
the
second
bottle
from
the
pack
and
give
it
to
the
wife
or
someone
o
solid
brew
but
i
feel
a
little
less
emphasis
on
the
chocolate
would
have
made
this
beer
outstanding
obviously
the
chocolate
was
meant
to
be
the
focal
point
but
i
feel
balance
must
always
be
upheld
this
doesnt
really
come
across
as
a
bock
to
me
it
is
kind
of
complex
but
not
as
the
style
intends
also
the
mouthfeel
kind
of
ruins
it
oi
find
this
to
be
a
very
pleasant
seasonal
beer
it
came
in
the
sam
adams
winter
seasonal
12pack
and
it
is
one
of
two
in
the
whole
batch
i
find
this
to
be
appropriate
i
wouldnt
even
mind
a
third
but
im
not
crazy
enough
to
have
a
fourth
what
sam
adams
has
with
this
beer
is
good
they
just
need
give
it
a
little
boost
all
around
more
malts
richer
maybe
even
smokier
chocolate
would
be
great
but
above
all
im
missing
out
on
that
thick
mouthfeel
this
beer
isnt
amazing
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
buy
it
on
its
own
if
it
wasnt
part
of
the
winter
variety
pack
though
overall
this
beer
is
okay
its
a
little
too
in
your
face
chocolate
in
not
the
best
of
ways
nothing
really
objectionable
going
on
yet
nothing
very
exciting
pours
a
dark
brown
black
with
a
little
lacing
that
doesnt
linger
long
the
lacing
is
a
thin
light
brown
smells
of
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
sweet
roasted
malt
taste
with
chocolate
notes
at
the
end
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
smooth
finish
with
average
carbonation
okay
beer
to
enjoy
on
occasion
would
be
good
with
a
dessert
would
also
like
to
use
this
as
a
marinade
item
at
some
point
o
decent
brew
overall
cheap
and
available
and
i
like
all
of
those
things
the
qualities
of
the
actual
beer
were
solid
but
certainly
not
great
its
no
breakfast
stout
but
its
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
really
good
beer
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
your
regular
bock
and
the
chocolate
is
fantastic
and
balanced
im
impressed
o
if
this
beer
had
a
little
less
chocolate
milk
taste
i
would
give
it
a
much
better
grade
i
know
it
is
a
chocolate
bock
but
it
almost
seems
fake
like
chocolate
syrup
i
think
this
would
be
a
pretty
decent
desert
beer
but
not
much
else
meh
if
i
have
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
to
get
at
the
old
fezziwig
and
holiday
porter
it
aint
so
bad
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
light
black
tiny
tanish
head
no
lacing
smell
is
hersey
syrup
and
some
dark
malts
taste
is
the
same
not
bad
but
nothing
earth
shattering
body
is
on
the
thin
side
and
carbonation
is
fine
i
remember
this
beer
when
it
was
a
big
beer
it
was
really
expensive
but
much
better
and
more
complex
it
taste
fine
but
not
nearly
what
it
once
was
o
a
good
beer
but
nothing
overly
complex
fits
the
season
well
and
again
is
easy
to
drink
o
well
im
certainly
glad
i
waited
for
the
12
oz
format
to
enjoy
this
brew
its
not
bad
but
certainly
not
worth
the
absurd
prices
it
was
going
for
in
the
22
oz
formats
the
chocolate
is
nice
but
a
little
understated
chocolate
and
bock
just
doesnt
pair
as
nicely
as
chocolate
and
stout
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
offering
from
sam
adams
and
a
great
inclusion
in
the
winter
variety
pack
like
it
its
ok
poured
from
the
bottle
a
rubyblack
color
not
quite
opaque
topped
with
a
hearty
amount
of
thick
creamy
foam
theres
a
subtle
roast
on
the
nose
but
nothing
big
or
overly
powerful
tastes
sweet
and
chocolaty
but
real
smooth
it
starts
off
harsh
bitter
sharp
but
quickly
mellows
out
into
a
drinkable
desert
like
a
chocolate
fizz
soda
o
this
is
pretty
good
nothing
mindblowing
by
any
stretch
but
its
quite
enjoyable
if
the
rest
of
this
twelve
pack
does
good
this
will
make
more
regular
appearances
in
my
fridge
in
the
coming
months
bring
back
cranberry
lambic
o
i
think
this
beer
is
delicious
an
excellent
addition
to
their
winter
selection
overall
pretty
good
not
what
was
intended
as
there
should
probably
be
more
chocolate
but
still
pretty
good
for
what
it
has
become
this
was
from
the
big
blue
bottle
poured
a
dark
reddish
brownnearly
black
color
with
a
good
brown
head
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
coffee
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
and
rich
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
d
id
say
this
makes
a
nice
late
night
desert
beer
especially
good
for
a
cool
evening
worth
a
drink
interesting
flavor
o
while
this
beer
may
not
be
for
everyone
or
a
goto
for
myself
even
it
delivers
everything
id
expect
out
of
a
chocolate
bock
worth
a
try
unless
youre
a
bock
purist
or
you
really
just
dont
like
malt
bombs
overall
i
think
this
is
a
lovely
beer
and
fantastic
for
its
nuances
and
complexity
i
do
admit
a
certain
surprise
at
how
relatively
light
the
actual
cocoa
flavors
were
given
that
the
bottle
advertises
that
the
beer
was
aged
on
a
bed
of
rare
dark
cocoa
nibs
i
somehow
expected
the
resulting
flavors
to
hit
me
over
the
head
and
drag
me
into
a
cave
instead
they
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
politely
asked
me
to
dance
still
the
flavors
were
compelling
and
i
would
gladly
tango
with
them
a
second
time
as
mentioned
the
beer
isnt
overpowering
which
can
be
offputting
to
some
especially
dark
beer
affectionados
but
i
thought
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
altogether
and
a
nice
looking
one
at
that
o
mostly
enjoyed
this
seasonal
pretty
drinkable
though
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
two
in
a
sitting
ofolks
this
is
a
miss
almost
makes
the
winter
pack
not
worth
buying
d
overall
drinkability
was
average
one
or
two
max
not
bad
but
not
special
either
poured
dark
coffee
brown
with
slight
ruby
highlights
with
a
small
eggshell
head
that
receded
almost
completely
cocoa
and
burnt
coffee
on
the
nose
taste
of
semisweet
chocolate
that
fades
away
to
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
roastednearlyburnt
coffee
i
wasnt
too
crazy
about
this
one
thinner
than
it
appeared
lightmedium
body
maybe
even
a
bit
fizzy
drinkable
but
perhaps
not
more
than
one
serving
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
brown
colored
head
that
turned
into
just
a
thin
film
over
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
was
pretty
sweet
actually
reminded
me
of
a
milk
chocolate
bar
mixed
with
a
bunch
of
malts
the
taste
was
sweet
up
front
with
a
chocolaty
base
that
changes
into
a
dry
malt
aftertaste
overall
the
beer
was
at
its
best
the
first
time
i
had
it
after
that
the
flavor
didnt
have
the
impact
like
it
used
to
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
worthy
of
trying
with
a
dessert
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
smooth
with
a
watery
feel
as
this
beer
is
very
light
with
a
light
body
and
the
only
aspect
that
seems
heavy
is
the
dry
cocoacoffee
aftertaste
very
surprised
at
how
light
this
beer
felt
and
how
easy
it
went
down
decent
drinkability
and
another
good
sam
adams
variety
pack
beer
but
not
a
beer
that
id
buy
a
six
pack
ofworth
trying
for
those
who
like
variety
o
not
bad
i
remember
the
hype
behind
the
beer
a
year
or
two
ago
when
it
was
in
the
bigger
bottles
for
15
per
glad
i
didnt
buy
one
then
and
held
out
for
the
1
something
12
ozer
worth
a
try
but
nothing
super
special
overall
not
too
bad
in
my
opinion
nothing
to
blow
your
doors
off
just
subtle
flavors
a
decent
comfortable
brew
i
was
not
a
fan
of
this
one
at
all
i
did
not
finish
the
bottle
o
quite
drinkable
but
not
fantastic

mouth
is
ok
shortlived
flavor
wouldnt
run
to
get
this
again
but
happy
its
on
my
resume
my
only
minor
quibble
with
the
beer
is
the
mouth
i
wish
it
was
a
little
thicker
and
creamier
allinall
an
enjoyable
treat
i
think
the
idea
of
an
all
chocolate
beer
was
a
pretty
nice
concept
unfortunately
i
think
what
they
should
have
done
was
use
different
types
of
cocoa
to
vary
the
sweetness
and
add
some
bitterness
to
it
o
pretty
good
for
a
chocolate
bock
but
nothing
spectacular
nice
and
id
even
be
tempted
to
buy
a
6pack
of
these
if
offered
one
day
as
a
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
a
better
concept
than
a
finished
product
i
applaud
the
effort
but
this
beer
isnt
for
me
overall
im
sorry
but
i
just
dont
think
chocolate
has
any
place
in
a
bock
save
the
chocolate
for
the
stouts
and
porters
it
has
no
place
in
a
thinbodied
lager
dont
expect
too
much
from
this
beer
it
is
what
it
is
it
was
good
to
try
once
but
not
something
im
likely
to
have
again
o
pretty
alright
gets
better
as
i
get
used
to
it
too
much
chocolate
though
and
not
much
else
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
release
from
sam
adams
but
at
the
same
time
not
something
to
go
absolutely
crazy
over
either
its
just
a
shame
this
is
not
released
in
6
packs
i
would
certainly
consider
buying
a
6er
of
this
if
they
had
it
would
def
recommend
solid
1
thumb
up
mf
medium
body
with
more
that
enough
carbonstion
more
of
a
novelty
than
a
good
bock
more
of
a
chocolate
porter
a
little
tasty
but
not
close
to
style
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
great
to
introduce
a
beer
noob
to
however
i
wish
sa
could
have
given
this
beer
a
larger
body
and
more
lagered
taste
there
are
more
chocolaty
beers
out
there
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
in
my
experience
goes
well
with
pasta
and
chocolate
chip
cookies
alike
the
sweetness
would
make
it
difficult
to
drink
more
than
one
needed
a
little
more
bitterness
to
soften
the
sweet
flavor
pours
brown
with
very
little
head
has
a
sweet
dark
chocolate
aroma
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
very
strong
flavors
of
milk
and
dark
chocolate
making
this
essentially
the
cold
hot
cocoa
of
beers
also
has
notes
of
toasty
malt
that
balance
it
all
out
and
give
it
a
more
typical
dark
beer
flavor
you
can
really
taste
the
real
cocoa
its
brewed
with
and
to
get
a
better
idea
of
the
flavor
im
talking
about
try
a
bit
of
the
baking
cocoa
next
time
you
make
brownies
delicious
rich
and
almost
over
powering
this
is
an
great
treatdessert
beer
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
this
is
a
strait
up
chocolate
beer
very
low
carbonation
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
flavor
of
liquid
chocolate
chips
and
just
a
hint
of
malt
just
a
great
desert
beer
or
a
nice
cold
weather
sipper
probably
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
just
for
its
simplicity
and
great
flavor
i
found
it
very
drinkable
and
could
have
23
at
a
time
if
i
could
buy
them
more
than
part
of
a
variety
pack
smell
of
vanilla
carmel
chocolate
rich
malt
and
basically
all
i
have
stated
of
the
smell
is
as
much
as
the
same
for
the
taste
i
could
honestly
say
that
this
also
has
good
drinkability
as
well
dvery
drinkable
and
nice
enjoy
ok
tad
disappointing
this
beer
wasnt
bad
but
i
have
to
mention
that
i
have
had
the
original
that
was
sold
in
750ml
bottles
and
more
recently
an
04
vintage
that
was
really
fantastic
this
just
wasnt
as
good
nor
did
i
expect
it
to
be
conclusion
i
pity
the
other
reviewers
who
paid
upwards
of
16
for
this
beer
i
got
two
12oz
bottles
in
a
12pack
that
cost
less
than
that
chocolate
bock
is
a
mellow
very
drinkable
beerif
you
like
cocoa
of
coursebut
its
definitely
not
worth
the
premium
price
that
say
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
could
fetch
either
way
if
you
can
find
this
beer
give
it
a
try
overall
a
very
nice
blending
of
flavors
letting
one
have
an
exquisitely
tasty
chocolaty
experience
d
this
is
not
terribly
drinkable
for
me
it
has
a
huge
wow
factor
of
chocolate
initially
but
as
i
worked
through
the
glass
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
grew
tired
of
this
and
would
not
have
wanted
to
follow
it
with
another
one
pours
with
an
opaque
chocolate
brown
color
that
is
much
like
that
of
a
good
stout
the
aroma
almost
explodes
out
of
the
bottle
from
the
second
the
cap
is
removed
with
the
unmistakable
scent
of
bittersweet
chocolate
the
flavor
is
likewise
dense
with
chocolate
with
a
rich
chocolate
cake
characteristic
up
front
this
chocolate
bomb
wears
on
the
palate
after
a
while
though
and
an
earthy
bitterness
that
doesnt
entirely
mesh
with
the
chocolate
notes
creeps
in
the
texture
is
smooth
creamy
but
also
quite
clean
creating
a
strange
and
interesting
contrast
to
the
rich
flavor
overall
this
may
be
the
most
chocolateflavored
beer
ive
had
but
the
novelty
wears
off
after
a
while
and
whats
left
isnt
particularly
robust
definitely
interesting
though
and
worth
the
try
drinks
pretty
well
one
of
my
favs
from
the
winter
pack
interesting
beer
alcoholic
cocoa
nibs
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
malty
and
smooth
when
resting
in
your
mouth
i
drank
this
in
absolutely
no
time
but
i
dont
necesarrily
want
to
try
it
again
in
the
near
future
i
thought
it
was
a
little
too
malty
and
candylike
my
opinions
did
not
change
over
the
course
of
two
months
i
sampled
both
of
these
bottles
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
black
with
a
creamy
head
very
nice
chocolate
smell
below
average
head
retention
average
stickage
this
beer
tasted
more
like
a
brown
ale
to
me
then
a
bock
i
think
i
would
have
like
a
more
of
a
bitter
chocolate
taste
this
tasted
like
milk
chocolate
if
that
is
possible
average
beer
seasonal
d
might
be
a
little
too
much
chocolate
if
thats
possible
i
enjoyed
it
but
thank
god
its
only
a
seasonal
this
is
a
wonderful
chocolate
winter
beer
hopefully
sam
adams
will
continue
to
bring
this
beer
to
a
higher
profile
and
release
it
in
612
packs
next
year
or
even
on
tap
this
beer
has
a
nice
dark
chocolate
body
with
a
light
tan
head
that
fades
away
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
nice
and
of
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
dark
chocolate
then
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
pick
up
a
little
vanilla
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
a
little
syrupy
constituency
to
it
i
think
it
is
drinkable
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
i
couldnt
drink
this
all
the
time
but
once
in
a
while
is
good
for
me
notes
this
beer
seems
to
get
a
lot
of
hype
both
good
and
bad
i
think
it
is
somewhere
in
the
middle
this
beer
screams
sweet
stout
with
a
twist
but
a
chocolate
bock
it
is
and
this
billy
goat
gives
it
two
horns
up
dnot
bad
good
mouthfeel
just
wish
it
was
a
little
richer
this
was
better
than
i
expected
the
chocolate
didnt
overpower
and
it
didnt
go
over
the
edge
on
the
sweetness
got
this
beer
in
the
winter
classics
pack
very
impressed
with
this
beer
its
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
it
has
a
good
chocolate
taste
to
it
real
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
good
the
smell
is
real
good
nice
chocolate
smell
to
it
i
recommend
this
beer
if
you
like
chocolate
beers
or
if
u
just
want
to
try
something
different
good
winter
beer
whoops
poured
it
like
a
madman
so
theres
a
massive
tan
head
on
top
of
this
black
bodied
beer
considerable
amber
light
hues
enough
that
its
probably
really
as
dark
of
a
brown
as
you
can
get
before
it
turns
black
on
the
spectrum
lagered
malt
scent
nothing
too
impressive
taste
is
a
lagered
malt
one
mainly
chocolate
but
id
say
theres
more
than
one
malt
in
there
some
caramel
influence
just
a
light
hop
influence
fairly
full
bodied
somewhat
sharp
but
pretty
smooth
overall
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
this
brew
not
a
bad
bock
d
comforting
and
enjoyable
brew
d
a
treat
but
a
sipper
for
sure
this
beer
sure
is
distinct
a
bit
of
a
novelty
in
a
good
way
though
not
really
malty
enough
to
be
much
of
a
bock
but
then
the
label
does
say
ale
with
cocoa
confusing
marketing
feel
is
less
than
medium
muddy
barely
carbed
hardly
drinkable
overall
its
not
bad
nothing
special
but
easy
to
drink
and
if
you
like
chocolate
milkshakes
ya
might
like
a
lighter
less
thick
version
put
it
in
a
bomber
jim
id
buy
this
kick
ass
beer
year
round
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
as
its
name
implies
chocolate
in
the
name
and
it
actually
tastes
of
cocoa
imagine
that
not
just
a
bunch
of
overhyped
crap
malty
chocolaty
balanced
lacing
even
mouthfeel
yes
on
all
counts
its
worth
the
winter
seasonal
12er
price
no
more
than
two
due
to
the
sweetness
but
overall
not
a
bad
brew
who
put
nestle
qwik
in
my
beer
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
like
a
watery
herseys
kiss
its
color
is
dark
with
creamy
head
did
the
brewer
hit
his
mark
oh
yeah
only
issue
it
is
too
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
and
you
know
what
that
means
not
a
session
beer
for
this
guy
d
it
is
quite
tasty
but
the
chocolate
tastes
arent
something
you
want
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
of
in
a
night
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
its
not
bad
just
not
as
good
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
really
surprised
me
with
its
rich
chocolate
taste
props
to
jim
and
co
for
another
good
addition
to
the
sa
lineup
however
i
cant
help
but
wonder
what
this
would
have
turned
out
like
if
boston
beer
co
took
the
chocolate
idea
in
the
direction
of
an
imperial
stout
instead
of
a
bock
i
was
really
happy
about
getting
this
in
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
it
is
really
dark
with
some
light
coming
through
the
edges
the
head
recedes
to
a
slight
coating
and
this
remains
throughout
the
beer
the
beer
has
a
coco
smell
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
really
nice
it
is
coco
and
for
some
reason
it
reminds
me
really
strongly
of
old
sheet
music
which
i
really
really
like
it
is
a
bit
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
some
lively
smooth
and
fine
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
which
i
would
love
to
have
a
whole
keg
of
and
would
think
nothing
of
drinking
very
often
this
has
gone
from
a
22year
old
out
of
control
snookilike
girl
to
stifflers
mom
incredibly
wellbalanced
dangerously
smooth
this
stuff
mellows
out
a
ton
very
very
nice
it
said
to
drink
the
bottle
by
march
2005
but
we
didnt
listen
got
damn
m
full
bodied
beer
with
little
carbonation
but
it
seems
right
for
the
flavor
d
when
i
can
find
it
i
love
to
grab
a
few
of
these
beers
and
save
them
for
those
gray
drab
days
of
winter
this
is
like
comfort
food
in
a
glass
poured
into
a
pint
glass
deep
brown
with
a
light
khaki
one
finger
head
smells
of
sweet
cocoa
and
chocolate
malted
grain
great
taste
dark
chocolate
and
mild
hop
battering
its
a
smooth
taste
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
compared
to
the
apearance
with
nice
carbonation
drinkable
are
well
a
nice
beer
for
a
snowy
winter
night
d
im
in
no
rush
to
plow
through
six
of
these
its
easy
to
take
my
time
drinking
this
one
the
beer
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
due
to
sweetness
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
i
do
not
mind
some
sweetness
in
my
beers
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
it
thus
it
does
not
bother
me
that
the
beer
is
mostly
sweet
chocolate
notes
the
beer
could
be
more
balanced
and
a
bit
heavier
in
order
to
accentuate
the
chocolate
flavor
d
i
think
the
intense
chocolate
on
the
nose
would
get
tiresome
a
few
of
these
but
the
taste
is
good
enough
to
warrant
drinking
one
more
bottle
sam
adams
need
to
name
there
beers
in
the
style
the
brew
them
just
like
there
cranberry
offering
they
label
a
lambic
this
one
is
a
chocolatey
porter
not
a
german
brewed
bock
d
very
drinkable
doesnt
take
a
lot
out
of
me
to
guzzle
one
down
i
could
see
more
than
one
easily
very
good
for
the
chocolate
lover
in
us
all
d
pretty
drinkable
low
abv
decent
taste
mouthfeel
creamy
and
smooth
texture
the
body
is
sweet
and
the
body
if
full
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
but
there
is
an
astringency
that
lingers
into
the
finish
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
m
medium
body
light
carbonation
smooth
d
very
drinkable
but
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
so
as
a
dessert
would
be
greatan
all
around
great
beer
from
sam
adams
overall
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
gladly
get
more
when
it
is
in
season
again
but
next
time
i
will
try
to
age
one
of
the
bottles
my
original
bottle
that
tasted
different
personally
i
thought
it
was
better
was
about
one
and
a
half
years
past
the
printed
expiration
date
and
had
a
much
more
refined
taste
like
the
chocolate
flavor
mellowed
out
and
belonged
rather
than
being
an
addition
dnot
hard
to
put
one
back
but
the
finish
is
a
little
too
reminiscent
of
malted
milk
ball
candy
and
swiss
miss
hot
cocoa
minus
the
mini
marshmellows
my
least
favorite
of
the
sam
adams
holiday
sampler
pack
i
would
not
buy
this
on
its
own
the
only
thing
that
wasnt
outstanding
about
this
beer
was
the
smell
there
was
very
little
smell
in
this
beer
i
had
almost
no
idea
what
to
expect
when
going
into
the
taste
with
that
being
said
this
was
an
awesome
beer
super
malty
super
sweet
for
sure
a
desert
beer
i
got
the
cocoa
and
the
chocolate
and
oddly
enough
i
tasted
more
vanilla
that
i
did
chocolate
weird
but
this
beer
is
excellent
very
well
balanced
very
very
drinkable
just
yummy
d
i
wish
they
sold
these
in
6
packs
id
buy
a
couple
and
offer
them
up
as
a
perfect
dessert
beer
to
a
double
chocolate
brownie
sundae
or
something
similar
very
good
for
some
reason
i
dont
remember
the
2009s
22
oz
bomber
tasting
the
same
as
this
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
not
syrupy
at
all
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
the
best
parts
of
the
beer
but
even
those
notable
aspects
cant
save
this
one
from
an
average
score
this
beer
has
average
written
all
over
it
its
really
nothing
worth
buying
for
someone
who
likes
their
beers
to
be
flavorful
and
balanced
pass
on
this
one
md
crisp
carbonation
creamy
mouthfeel
while
still
a
light
mouthfeel
the
taste
just
leaves
me
not
wanting
to
finish
the
bottle
i
could
blame
it
on
the
age
but
according
to
other
reviews
im
guessing
this
is
just
how
it
is
drinkability
purchased
in
the
sam
adams
holiday
sampler
this
brew
doesnt
come
close
to
the
winter
lager
the
other
bock
in
the
box
there
is
a
sweetness
that
is
unbalanced
by
the
other
flavors
nothing
steps
in
to
counter
or
compliment
the
sweetness
between
the
maraschino
cherry
and
roasted
cocoa
i
keep
thinking
of
cherry
pipe
tobacco
while
drinking
this
one
break
away
just
when
it
seems
so
clear
that
its
over
now
drink
your
big
black
cow
and
get
out
of
here
overall
this
isnt
one
ill
be
anticipating
next
year
hell
i
dont
even
anticipate
the
second
bottle
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
to
a
brownish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
cocoa
powder
like
smell
in
the
taste
sweet
chocolate
a
small
roasted
malt
and
a
back
round
of
what
to
seem
to
bee
cocoa
powder
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
small
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
it
kind
of
smells
and
tastes
of
cocoa
powder
actually
kind
of
average
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
purchase
it
if
it
were
available
year
round
low
abv
and
good
flavors
make
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
d
im
having
difficulty
finishing
this
one
due
to
the
profound
chocolate
flavors
sam
adams
makes
a
great
bock
in
their
winter
lager
which
balances
its
cinnamon
flavors
quite
well
i
wish
they
had
created
that
same
kind
of
balance
here
if
you
enjoy
chocolate
with
your
beer
than
this
one
should
be
a
hit
with
you
otherwise
it
just
feels
like
a
poor
attempt
at
a
holiday
brew
one
that
is
poorly
balanced
drinkability
the
kind
of
beer
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
to
drink
its
not
bad
though
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
in
the
right
setting

d
this

brings
back
some
memories
for
me
me
and
my
closest
friends
made
it
a
habit
to
split
a
few
big
bottles
of
this
during

and
we
are
30

with
it
cool
to
see
in
the
small
format
minus
the
1520ish
pricetag
a
decent
beer
well
suited
for
dessert
i
definitely
agree
with
jasons
review
saying
this
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
porter
i
dont
get
much
of
a
bock
presence
but
that
being
said
i
did
like
it
chocolate
comes
through
nicely
without
overpowering
moderate
body
and
carbonation
interesting
flavors
but
as
a
beer
it
doent
wow
me
d
this
is
basic
and
borderline
cloying
but
momentarily
tasty
a
bit
too
sweet
of
a
base
bock
is
partially
rescued
by
a
very
pleasant
chocolate
flavor
this
needs
more
heft
more
bitterness
and
more
carbonation
as
it
stands
its
a
bit
too
thin
and
onedimensional
even
for
a
desserty
bock
part
of
the
winter
mixer
that
has
served
me
well
pours
a
dark
translucent
mahogany
with
a
big
fizzy
tan
head
head
recedes
pretty
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
scent
is
overwhelmingly
chocolate
this
sounds
weird
but
i
think
i
detect
some
banana
in
there
as
well
odd
taste
is
again
tons
of
milk
chocolate
not
really
cloying
but
kind
of
overwhelming
where
you
cant
taste
much
else
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
liquid
version
of
a
chocolate
tootsie
pop
mouthfeel
was
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
like
everything
else
in
this
mixpack
drinkability
decent
brew
a
little
overdone
maybe
in
regard
to
the
chocolate
theme
but
i
think
bb
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
definitely
a
nice
winter
bock
d
very
delicious
and
drinkable
overall
not
one
of
sas
best
i
really
dont
want
another
for
me
this
is
why
i
should
not
read
other
reviews
of
beers
before
i
complete
my
own
really
liked
this
beer
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
2010
winter
sampler
pours
surprisingly
dark
and
much
closer
to
opaque
than
expected
one
finger
head
recedes
very
quickly
smell
is
of
mellow
chocolate
and
quite
strong
pleasingly
sweet
very
mild
hop
profile
plenty
of
chocolate
flavor
on
the
tongue
with
some
coffee
notes
jumping
out
i
enjoyed
the
first
several
sips
but
the
effect
wore
off
fairly
quickly
i
can
see
how
this
one
might
get
old
if
having
more
than
one
or
two
as
its
sweet
yet
doesnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
other
dimensions
some
noted
its
tough
to
find
the
typical
bocklager
flavors
and
i
agree
its
not
very
pronounced
quite
a
bit
of
chocolate
the
milky
caramely
sweetness
hangs
around
for
a
bit
but
isnt
too
thick
medium
body
with
the
carbonation
adding
a
little
buoyancy
very
easy
to
drink
sweet
enough
to
be
a
dessert
drink
but
not
really
impressive
for
any
reason
its
good
but
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
fairly
tasty
and
not
overly
chocolately
making
it
sort
of
borderline
dessertish
but
not
fully
drinkability
is
ok
not
something
i
would
run
out
try
again
but
worth
a
try
its
really
an
average
beer
and
thats
disappointing
by
far
my
least
favorite
of
the
winter
classics
pack
i
guess
ill
save
the
second
one
for
a
friend
who
wants
to
give
it
a
try
d
doesnt
taste
like
much
other
than
chocolate
milk
meh
give
me
a
real
beer
i
would
label
this
a
fine
dessert
beer
cheers
this
beer
was
way
too
sweet
so
cloying
it
wasnt
that
much
fun
to
drink
and
certainly
no
more
than
one
at
a
time
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
was
honestly
pretty
disappointed
the
holiday
porter
and
old
fezziwig
are
lightyears
beyond
this
beer
give
this
one
to
your
girlfriend
who
likes
fruitysweet
beers
drinkability
based
on
flavor
alone
im
not
sure
if
ill
be
able
to
finish
this
one
i
was
excited
to
try
this
because
of
all
the
good
things
i
read
about
it
but
now
i
sit
here
disappointed
with
this
brew
watered
down
flavor
and
hardly
a
hint
of
chocolate
maybe
good
for
the
beer
beginner
the
rest
body
is
actually
on
the
thin
side
the
finish
a
fairly
fast
and
clean
and
drinkability
is
fair
im
not
all
that
impressed
with
this
one
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
complex
then
it
is
it
just
tastes
like
beer
with
a
lot
of
cocoa
in
it
this
is
a
very
tasty
chocolate
beer
thats
quite
easy
to
drink
a
great
replacement
for
the
cranberry
lambic
over
all
this
beer
is
an
amazing
one
some
might
find
the
chocolate
a
little
overwhelming
but
as
the
title
states
it
is
a
chocolate
bock
i
hope
this
one
comes
in
a
six
pack
later
on
as
it
would
be
an
excellent
night
cap
or
meal
ender
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
one
of
samuel
adams
better
ones
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
bock
has
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
settles
in
a
minute
or
two
a
really
sweet
chocolate
nose
not
a
whole
lot
else
to
mention
aroma
wise
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
some
roasted
malts
lots
of
chocolate
and
cocoa
tastes
upfront
but
i
do
get
more
of
those
roasted
malts
shining
through
and
a
nice
vanilla
flavor
in
the
back
i
thought
this
was
gonna
be
overwhelming
with
the
chocolate
but
i
like
it
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
its
not
something
i
would
wanna
drink
all
the
time
but
this
is
a
nice
dessert
beer
and
a
welcome
addition
to
the
sa
winter
packs
i
had
a
couple
singles
of
this
beer
from
the
winter
pack
and
we
had
them
tonight
with
dessert
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
dark
brown
cola
colored
body
nice
sized
white
head
foamed
up
a
nice
looking
beer
smell
was
very
sweet
almost
like
a
milk
stout
taste
was
overly
suagry
in
my
opinion
it
was
like
drinking
chocolate
milk
while
not
offensive
i
wish
it
was
toned
down
a
bit
would
have
liked
to
have
had
more
of
a
dark
bakers
cocoa
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
also
too
sweet
for
me
drinkability
was
just
average
i
could
drink
this
at
home
with
dessert
but
i
would
not
have
more
than
one
of
this
beer
not
a
six
pack
beer
o
i
like
chocolate
and
beer
and
i
am
a
fan
of
sam
adams
so
this
beer
was
a
great
disappointment
d
very
drinkable
at
5
nice
mellow
nothing
special
chocolate
bock
maybe
not
the
best
chocolate
brew
out
there
but
i
always
seem
to
enjoy
it
fairly
decent
beer
the
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
dont
quite
go
together
though
would
be
a
good
beer
to
have
with
sweet
desserts
cant
get
past
the
cheap
fake
qualities
to
the
flavorings
not
going
to
get
sick
having
one
but
two
maybe
underwhelming
misguided
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
but
had
an
oddness
to
it
i
cannot
quite
describe
drinkability
was
quite
good
as
well
i
would
have
this
one
again
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
its
not
bad
at
all
very
rich
and
leaves
a
heavy
aftertaste
and
lends
itself
more
to
sipping
than
sessioning
but
i
cant
complain
it
reminds
me
of
fudge
brownies
and
has
a
nice
warm
rich
flavor
of
well
chocolate
if
youre
a
vanilla
kind
of
person
then
obviously
youll
think
its
overpowering
but
if
you
love
chocolate
you
must
try
this
at
least
once
d
unique
not
heavy
would
be
abe
to
drink
more
not
too
bad
very
good
drinkability
i
like
using
the
bock
to
distribute
the
chocolate
good
not
great
d
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
to
drink
im
a
fan
the
only
issue
is
that
the
profile
is
a
bit
onenoted
not
much
balance
as
the
chocolate
is
entirely
dominant
skål
d
i
dont
see
what
makes
this
a
bock
they
couldve
passed
it
off
as
a
chocolate
porter
and
i
wouldve
been
none
the
wiser
still
a
better
than
average
dessert
beer
in
a
way
though
its
handicapped
by
its
qualities
its
far
too
rich
to
be
sessionable
but
it
isnt
nearly
big
enough
to
be
a
sipper
too
bad
drinkability
a
unique
beer
and
one
thats
very
easy
to
drink
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
some
cocoa
and
hints
of
herbal
hops
full
creamy
body
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
malt
some
cocoa
and
vanilla
finish
is
medium
slightly
sweet
unusual
but
interesting
brew
pours
a
very
dark
red
color
very
small
head
smell
is
somewhat
german
lager
with
dark
fruits
taste
is
crazy
never
tasted
anything
like
this
very
chocolaty
tastes
very
much
like
count
chocula
which
happens
to
be
my
favorite
cereal
very
unique
chocolate
marshmallow
cereal
taste
which
is
fairly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
rather
nice
as
well
dont
think
a
could
drink
this
beer
on
a
regular
occasion
but
it
is
definitely
a
unique
tasty
beer
i
must
have
been
hammered
while
writing
this
since
i
didnt
say
anything
bad
i
must
have
found
it
enjoyable
im
assuming
the
color
was
dark
youre
either
going
to
buy
this
beer
or
not
its
worth
it
in
a
mix
pack
i
dont
care
if
this
review
ruins
my
cred
sic
but
i
loves
me
some
chocolate
beer
woohoo
note
i
gave
it
a
3
on
taste
because
i
didnt
think
this
was
indicative
of
a
bock
as
a
porter
it
would
be
about
a
4
doesnt
really
come
across
like
anything
like
a
bock
but
that
is
a
good
thing
in
my
book
lots
of
flavor
one
of
the
best
and
most
affordable
sa
beers
out
there
d
all
in
all
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
see
myself
sitting
down
on
a
cool
winter
night
and
putting
down
5
or
6
as
enjoyable
as
the
start
is
with
a
nice
appearance
and
great
smell
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
fall
a
bit
short
and
keep
me
from
wanting
pint
after
pint
like
sam
adams
holiday
porter
also
with
such
awesome
dessert
beers
like
bourbon
county
stout
and
its
derivatives
i
think
ill
be
happy
to
enjoy
the
chocolate
bock
as
part
of
the
holiday
sampler
but
no
further
than
that
the
mouth
is
the
weakest
aspect
of
this
beer
thin
and
slick
going
down
carbonation
level
is
short
and
tame
this
is
definitely
a
chocolate
beer
first
and
foremost
lots
of
creamy
milk
chocolate
cocoa
some
sweet
vanilla
and
more
chocolate
there
isnt
a
bitter
presence
at
all
this
is
for
sure
a
dessert
beer
it
was
pleasant
to
drink
but
id
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
deasy
drinking
beer
with
big
flavors
the
finish
in
all
aspects
nose
taste
and
body
seems
to
fall
thin
and
is
somewhat
watery
the
flavors
are
still
vibrant
and
the
flavor
and
nose
up
front
the
malt
characteristics
are
rather
light
as
the
sweetness
seems
a
little
strong
still
easy
to
drink
and
reasonably
tasty
d
not
bad
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
very
dessertlike
beer
overall
i
wouldnt
really
call
this
a
bock
at
alldefinitely
a
misnomer
to
me
still
it
goes
down
well
enough
and
suits
the
season
d
too
sweet
for
more
than
one
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
but
glad
to
have
tried
it
light
to
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
seems
a
little
high
and
there
is
a
sweet
aftertaste
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
overall
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
for
being
a
chocolate
bock
i
expected
a
little
more
chocolate
the
aftertaste
lingers
and
its
not
entirely
pleasant
but
for
what
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
d
a
decent
above
average
bock
lots
of
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
in
the
smell
and
taste
if
it
wasnt
for
the
small
amount
of
metal
in
the
smell
it
would
be
even
better
would
give
another
shot
overallehhh
ok
as
a
holiday
beer
for
something
different
but
not
great
and
i
was
not
thirsting
for
more
good
quite
flavorful
and
under
6
abv
but
the
name
is
deceptive
for
sure
in
a
perfect
pint
this
pours
a
very
deep
brown
with
some
red
hues
just
a
little
bit
of
head
and
no
lacing
on
the
nose
its
straight
chocolate
and
a
little
something
like
brussel
sprouts
that
i
always
seem
to
get
from
very
chocolaty
beers
not
altogether
unpleasant
here
on
the
tongue
there
are
roasted
malts
and
lots
of
chocolate
and
some
nice
bitterness
coming
through
in
the
mouth
its
rather
thin
and
a
little
fizzy
like
some
of
the
other
beers
in
this
mixed
12
overall
its
a
nice
beer
a
bit
too
much
to
drink
back
to
back
but
a
nice
diversion
drinkability
due
to
the
high
sweetness
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
sitting
not
a
bad
beer
as
a
result
but
not
one
you
want
to
do
more
than
a
couple
in
an
evening
maybe
best
as
a
desert
sort
of
thing
due
to
the
sweetness
as
for
drinkability
there
were
2
in
beer
cooler
and
i
had
them
both
would
of
liked
to
have
had
a
couple
more
a
very
nice
holiday
beer
but
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
not
a
real
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
not
great
im
not
much
on
the
style
and
i
cant
see
myself
having
this
again
d
this
is
a
true
dessert
beer
through
and
through
if
thats
your
thing
then
cheers
to
you
sa
chocolate
bock
into
sa
perfect
pint
pours
a
dark
black
with
ruby
red
highlights
around
the
edges
and
a
12
dark
tan
head
atop
smells
like
sweet
chocolate
syrup
with
no
beer
aspects
at
all
no
malts
grains
hops
or
anything
else
beer
related
for
that
matter
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
for
the
style
tastes
almost
sickeningly
cloying
on
the
chocolate
part
this
is
definatly
not
chocolate
roasted
malts
here
but
more
so
a
fake
chocolate
extract
this
is
why
im
amazed
at
how
many
other
bas
actually
refer
to
this
taste
as
chocolate
malts
halfway
through
the
12oz
serving
its
really
hard
not
to
get
sick
from
this
brew
shes
tough
to
get
in
and
one
is
definaly
way
too
much
overall
i
really
liked
the
2008
sa
chocolate
bock
but
this
beer
is
no
doubt
a
different
recipe
and
falls
very
short
of
what
i
was
expecting
this
year
i
guess
thats
why
i
can
get
a
24pk
of
sa
winter
classics
19
99
that
includes
4
of
these
beers
vs
paying
11
99
for
a
22oz
bomber
of
the
08
recipe
i
just
cant
recommend
this
beer
to
be
paired
with
anything
other
than
triple
chocolate
cookies
cheers
drinks
pretty
well
overall
not
a
great
bock
not
a
great
chocolate
beer
many
chocolate
stouts
that
bring
more
roast
and
bitterness
with
less
sweetness
are
better
but
it
ends
up
being
pretty
good
definitely
better
suited
in
the
winter
mix
pack
than
15
for
a
bottle
would
drink
again
in
the
right
setting
drinkability
goes
down
easy
enough
but
a
bit
too
unbalanced
sweet
chocolate
malts
dominate
and
its
a
little
thin
d
drinks
good
actually
reminds
me
of
a
bock
but
different
in
ways
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
character
that
defines
it
more
then
its
first
impression
smell
d
im
not
sure
how
id
rate
it
as
a
straight
up
bock
but
as
a
winter
warmer
or
dessert
beer
its
good
a
little
bit
of
a
schticky
christmas
brew
but
the
warming
chocolate
sweetness
is
enjoyable
and
the
malts
legs
are
sturdy
enough
to
hold
up
the
palate
as
well
poured
this
into
a
tulip
cola
colored
body
with
about
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
fizzes
away
quickly
leaving
little
lace
definitely
chocolate
in
the
nose
rounded
out
with
maltiness
and
a
slight
dark
fruit
aroma
in
the
finish
the
chocolate
aroma
is
really
what
comes
out
mostly
on
this
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
those
chocolate
flavored
tootsie
roll
pops
the
flavor
has
the
same
tootsie
roll
pop
kind
of
chocolate
flavor
it
seems
to
be
that
with
a
weak
malt
body
feels
alright
i
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
to
the
body
and
it
drinks
okay
but
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
somewhere
another
home
run
for
the
boston
beer
company
very
glad
this
was
included
in
the
winter
variety
pack
this
year
d
i
find
this
to
be
a
robust
bock
but
the
little
bit
of
extra
carbonation
and
the
realistic
sweetness
of
it
make
it
surprisingly
drinkableafter
a
good
meal
d
the
chocolate
finish
though
enjoyable
would
make
this
a
hard
session
beer
i
dug
where
they
were
going
with
this
one
but
this
is
more
of
an
afterdinner
beer
d
easily
drinkable
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
a
nice
inclusion
in
the
winter
pack
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
of
these
but
wouldnt
go
nuts
trying
to
get
it
overall
another
nice
brew
from
sa
notes
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
a
highlight
of
the
2010
winter
mixed
12
pack
d
a
great
after
dinner
drink
or
nightcap
the
sweetness
may
prevent
one
from
having
too
many
in
one
sitting
i
recommend
this
beer
but
try
to
get
in
the
winter
classics
sample
this
way
you
get
about
the
same
quantity
of
this
beer
as
in
the
17
dollar
bottle
but
for
the
extra
two
or
three
bucks
you
spend
you
get
10
more
beers
d
overall
solid
beer
for
a
winter
evening
especially
as
an
after
dinner
drink
samuel
adams
chocolate
bock
was
dark
brown
in
color
with
some
red
showing
through
when
held
to
a
light
it
had
a
large
tan
head
that
didnt
last
but
did
leave
some
lacing
behind
the
smell
was
chocolate
with
some
dark
malt
the
taste
was
chocolaty
with
dark
malt
flavors
there
was
a
little
sweetness
upfront
with
a
balancing
bitterness
coming
through
towards
the
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkabilty
was
good
chocolate
bock
is
a
tasty
treat
and
welcome
addition
to
the
holiday
mix
pack
d
overall
fairly
drinkable
the
chocolate
flavor
is
nice
and
just
maybe
a
tad
overpowering
but
i
enjoyed
it
otherwise
the
only
thing
missing
was
maybe
a
little
malt
d
drinks
smooth
and
the
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
not
too
filling
pleasant
mellow
finish
this
is
a
really
easy
drinker
good
in
the
sampler
but
id
be
a
bit
unsatisfied
paying
for
a
single
big
bottle
of
this
d
higher
than
i
expected
this
one
surprised
me
not
great
but
not
awful
drinkability
i
like
milk
chocolate
and
this
certainly
shines
through
in
this
beer
a
tasty
holiday
treat
i
am
glad
this
got
included
in
the
variety
pack
i
could
have
several
not
what
i
had
hoped
for
the
color
was
nice
but
the
head
was
very
light
in
consistency
disappeared
within
seconds
the
aroma
of
the
beer
was
off
not
sure
how
to
explain
it
but
it
wasnt
right
a
little
chocolate
but
frankly
had
almost
no
smell
the
taste
was
rather
flat
more
carob
than
chocolate
with
a
odd
after
taste
in
all
an
okay
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
medium
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
in
closing
this
is
a
great
addition
to
the
samuel
adams
lineup
im
glad
to
see
that
theyre
trying
new
styles
that
are
outside
their
usual
mainstreams
d
this
is
basic
and
borderline
cloying
but
momentarily
tasty
a
bit
too
sweet
of
a
base
bock
is
partially
rescued
by
a
very
pleasant
chocolate
flavor
this
needs
more
heft
more
bitterness
and
more
carbonation
as
it
stands
its
a
bit
too
thin
and
onedimensional
even
for
a
desserty
bock
still
a
welcome
addition
over
the
muchmaligned
cranberry
lambic
smooth
dark
and
chocolatey
a
nice
cool
weather
beer
to
enjoy
once
or
twice
a
year
really
enjoyable
part
about
this
was
the
chocolate
they
really
came
thru
on
that
end
feel
you
can
feel
the
heaviness
and
the
chocolate
in
the
beer
no
beer
feeling
very
nice
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
balance
of
roasted
malt
and
sweet
chocolate
notes
there
is
also
a
subtle
hop
presence
but
this
beer
is
all
about
the
chocolate
it
dominates
the
flavor
but
it
isnt
one
dimensional
slightly
watered
down
making
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
all
that
interesting
decent
but
way
overpriced
i
wont
be
trying
this
one
again
anytime
soon
d
the
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
it
tastes
good
i
think
of
this
more
as
a
desert
beer
and
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
1
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
i
would
recommend
trying
it
got
this
as
part
of
their
seasonal
pack
this
year
it
poured
cola
with
a
dark
cola
color
smell
is
intensely
of
cocoa
taste
is
intensely
smokey
cocoa
with
hints
of
a
strong
vanilla
finish
it
has
a
pretty
thick
mouth
feel
and
very
little
alcohol
burn
this
beer
really
is
different
but
different
can
be
a
good
thing
this
is
not
a
session
beer
it
shouldnt
be
one
youd
go
to
for
a
beer
fix
its
more
like
most
chocolate
beers
a
desert
well
i
would
drink
it
if
the
chocolate
wasnt
so
much
it
gets
to
be
a
bit
overbearing
d
aftertaste
wears
you
down
im
considering
not
finishing
it
i
only
got
4
of
these
in
a
sam
adams
winter
pack
so
hopefully
i
can
find
more
somehow
d
at
first
the
chocolate
character
is
subdued
and
hard
to
pick
out
but
as
the
beer
warms
it
really
begins
to
come
out
the
chocolate
is
earthy
and
spicy
in
a
way
that
makes
the
beer
seem
more
like
an
ale
than
a
lager
the
chocolate
character
becomes
surprisingly
strong
as
the
beer
comes
up
towards
room
temperature
and
it
works
very
nicely
with
the
fruity
caramel
notes
of
the
base
beer
good
job
sam
adams
overallnotes
seems
pretty
runofthemill
for
sam
adams
really
another
solid
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
subtle
flavor
while
it
wont
go
on
my
favorites
list
it
certainly
will
be
in
my
hands
again
in
the
future
pleasant
little
drink
di
can
only
drink
about
one
or
maybe
two
of
these
at
a
time
due
to
the
heavy
chocolate
presence
but
overall
not
a
bad
brew
very
drinkable
beer
and
im
glad
boston
beer
co
decided
to
add
this
to
the
winter
variety
pack
so
much
better
than
coastal
wheat
db
probably
my
new
favorite
sam
adams
beer
after
black
lager
now
the
cocoa
flavor
here
is
very
nice
and
works
well
in
this
format
dark
coffee
brown
with
a
slight
fizzy
head
that
burns
off
into
a
filmy
skim
cocoa
vanilla
and
coffee
in
the
nose
nice
rich
chocolate
flavor
with
some
dark
roasty
malt
flavors
and
a
faint
smoky
vanilla
flavor
medium
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
better
in
a
13
12pack
than
i
do
in
the
previously
available
15
bomber
for
sure
a
tasty
brew
2
5
is
my
old
drinkability
score
and
i
stand
by
that
if
this
beer
is
fresh
now
however
with
the
change
to
an
overall
score
and
the
development
of
this
beverage
i
give
it
a
4
this
is
not
one
i
had
high
hopes
for
but
it
shows
that
a
year
can
make
a
world
of
difference
in
integrating
and
calming
a
beer
overall
good
beer
overall
another
solid
offering
from
sam
adams
im
definitely
glad
they
included
it
with
their
winter
pack
this
year
d
very
tasty
for
a
chocolate
beer
very
smooth
flavor
and
could
have
a
couple
of
these
whenever
d
overall
i
was
pleased
with
this
new
brew
while
im
still
not
entirely
convinced
it
is
all
natural
i
thought
samuel
adams
did
a
nice
job
mixing
the
wonders
chocolate
into
a
tasty
beer
that
works
itself
nicely
into
the
fridge
during
the
colder
months
sam
adams
does
not
disappoint
for
a
dark
beer
drinker
it
is
definitely
drinkable
i
was
pretty
impressed
considering
it
was
sam
adams
may
be
their
best
beer
o
i
think
it
misses
its
mark
in
that
the
chocolate
is
somewhat
absent
and
i
was
expecting
a
richer
more
velvety
mouthfeel
its
still
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
on
the
plus
side
you
could
probably
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
and
this
would
still
pair
well
with
desserts
that
incorporate
chocolate
or
berries
d
this
was
a
very
tasty
brew
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
multiples
of
this
in
one
sitting
it
would
be
too
sweet
but
nonetheless
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
a
nice
christmas
dinner
or
dessert
dark
brown
color
with
thin
tan
to
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
deep
earthy
malt
aromas
with
medium
roasted
quality
hints
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
but
it
is
minimal
the
aroma
doesnt
pop
but
it
is
very
pleasing
strong
chocolate
flavor
with
some
bready
and
roasted
malts
toward
the
end
very
sweet
and
chocolatey
makes
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
but
the
chocolate
is
all
there
is
to
it
not
much
backbone
to
this
one
d
low
abv
and
medium
body
could
make
this
really
drinkable
but
it
is
so
sweet
that
one
is
enough
it
is
definitely
a
dessert
beer
that
you
sip
d
in
the
mood
for
chocolate
try
this
its
a
decent
beer
overall
and
that
nose
and
taste
of
chocolate
should
sate
the
craving
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
think
this
brew
was
the
middle
of
the
road
for
the
winter
variety
pack
despite
its
reputation
ill
take
the
holiday
porter
over
this
any
day
drinkability
the
chocolate
finish
is
a
bit
sweet
but
leaves
me
wanting
more
d
if
you
want
a
chocolate
beer
that
reminds
you
of
nestle
quick
this
is
it
i
was
really
hoping
for
even
a
hint
of
smokiness
or
coffee
but
came
up
emptyhanded
still
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
not
much
of
a
head
from
the
pour
about
one
finger
and
it
died
quickly
color
is
a
dark
brown
equating
to
a
40
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
of
chocolate
mint
vanilla
malt
coffee
and
malt
tastes
like
coffee
chocolate
vanilla
cream
mint
wheat
malt
and
a
touch
of
pepper
this
bock
is
very
rich
and
creamy
in
my
mouth
maybe
a
little
sweet
and
rich
for
a
daily
drink
but
very
good
for
special
occasions
because
it
is
seasonal
it
is
not
a
good
everyday
drink
md
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
i
liked
it
the
smell
was
very
nice
and
the
chocolate
flavor
was
enjoyable
went
really
well
with
thanksgiving
dessert
glad
it
was
in
the
winter
pack
but
not
something
i
would
go
through
lots
of
beer
2
from
the
sampler
pack
i
am
really
glad
i
never
spent
the
15
for
a
bomber
of
this
countless
stouts
have
a
more
rounded
chocolate
flavor
than
this
beer
very
thin
from
the
2010
series
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
an
april
2011
expiration
date
the
pour
is
an
opaque
brown
to
black
with
just
about
nothing
for
a
head
but
the
ring
stays
for
a
while
the
aroma
is
sickly
sweet
with
chocolate
malts
but
little
else
yet
at
the
same
time
it
is
subtle
the
taste
has
a
more
pronounced
burnt
chocolate
feel
than
one
would
expect
following
the
aroma
there
are
some
thin
hops
way
back
behind
everything
else
it
definitely
brings
out
the
chocolate
and
cocoa
not
something
i
would
vigorously
look
for
but
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
its
tasty
it
seems
really
chocolateforward
and
im
not
a
diehard
chocolate
fan
roasted
cocoa
nibs
really
blow
through
and
present
themselves
powerfully
its
interesting
though
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
the
character
is
hidden
by
the
overt
milk
chocolate
not
that
its
a
bad
thing
im
glad
its
in
the
pack
and
ill
drink
it
again
but
its
just
an
odd
one
pours
a
darkish
brown
black
with
a
nice
head
that
leaves
pretty
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
a
slight
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
beginning
of
the
taste
i
get
a
strong
roasted
malt
presence
followed
by
sweet
chocolate
the
chocolate
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
for
a
beer
with
chocolate
in
the
name
its
not
too
sweet
but
sweet
enough
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
and
for
a
heavy
bock
the
drinkability
aint
too
bad
d
not
bad
bit
of
a
dessert
beer
probably
not
one
youd
drink
much
of
in
one
sitting
drinkability
is
good
i
could
have
easily
had
another
one
perhaps
ive
been
spoiled
by
the
tastes
of
other
chocolatestyled
beers
but
the
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
comes
off
a
bit
for
the
lack
of
a
better
words
straightforward
it
taste
like
its
supposed
to
and
does
it
in
a
clean
and
pleasing
fashion
but
i
cant
help
feeling
it
could
have
been
so
much
better
somehow
oh
well
this
is
another
solid
addition
to
the
sa
holiday
pack
i
enjoy
the
big
chocolate
flavor
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
bit
much
after
2
or
3
overall
i
was
really
excited
about
this
beer
but
it
was
a
major
disappointment
a
drinkable
and
sweet
beer
this
makes
an
good
evening
dessert
beer
its
almost
too
sweet
to
drink
in
any
quantity
and
i
imagine
after
several
of
these
you
might
lapse
into
a
sugar
coma
drinkable
yes
tasty
indeed
though
sweeter
than
other
sams
as
a
linger
of
cocoa
bitter
remains
would
enjoy
again
perhaps
another
holiday
cheers
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
tried
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
if
you
enjoy
the
taste
of
chocolate
d
it
is
enjoyable
just
not
what
is
advertised
this
was
the
biggest
let
down
of
the
pack
give
me
boston
lager
over
this
any
day
at
least
there
i
know
what
im
getting
myself
into
perhaps
this
was
hyped
higher
in
my
mind
and
forums
than
i
was
expecting
my
only
complaints
are
how
far
this
has
strayed
from
what
it
describes
itself
as
pours
a
clear
deep
dark
brown
with
faint
ruby
highlight
on
the
edges
minuscule
tan
head
disappears
almost
immediately
but
leaves
a
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
smells
like
a
full
glass
of
hersheys
chocolate
syrup
mixed
with
a
faint
hint
of
wet
dog
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
again
lots
of
chocolate
syrup
slight
bit
of
dark
fruit
and
a
hint
of
minerals
in
the
taste
as
well
sweet
chocolate
chewy
mouthfeel
oily
mouthfeel
and
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
i
remember
not
being
to
fond
of
this
when
i
overpaid
for
a
bigger
bottle
this
reasonably
priced
bottle
doesnt
make
it
much
better
its
really
kind
of
one
dimensional
i
get
lots
of
chocolate
and
little
else
d
this
was
highly
drinkable
beer
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
no
problem
drinking
it
the
abv
was
well
hidden
to
the
very
end
before
sneaking
up
overall
a
good
beer
that
sam
adams
seemed
to
deliver
on
overall
a
fair
beer
but
not
my
favorite
out
of
sam
adams
the
flavors
just
didnt
seem
to
balance
at
times
i
did
drink
it
out
of
a
bottle
which
is
not
my
preference
and
looking
at
the
bottle
itself
it
looked
like
it
might
have
been
sitting
around
for
a
while
i
had
never
seen
this
particular
beer
from
sam
adams
so
i
gave
it
a
try
will
update
review
if
and
when
i
find
it
and
buy
it
myself
it
just
happened
to
be
available
in
the
cooler
where
i
was
for
thanks
giving
drinkability
as
a
one
a
night
treat
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
bit
like
drinking
some
cocoa
soda
and
not
particularly
challenging
however
the
sweetness
never
cloys
as
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
comes
in
to
prevent
that
will
i
have
this
one
again
well
not
tonight
as
one
of
these
will
be
enough
but
on
another
night
id
be
happy
to
have
another
so
the
final
verdict
is
pleasant
enough
but
not
outstanding
salud
overall
not
the
most
exciting
beer
and
given
some
of
the
hype
it
gets
on
this
website
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
its
good
but
not
exceptional
and
i
think
its
somethiong
for
people
who
like
subtle
beers
but
not
for
those
of
us
who
like
more
bold
beers
d
i
never
bought
this
in
the
past
due
to
the
price
point
but
i
got
it
this
year
in
my
holiday
sampler
and
i
like
it
i
may
pick
up
a
bottle
in
the
future
whether
or
not
at
the
old
price
point
worth
trying
and
tasty
indeed
nice
blunt
smooth
and
a
little
oily
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
and
not
too
chocolaty
like
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
enjoy
before
march
notched
on
the
label
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
tight
two
inch
mochacolored
head
composed
of
tiny
compressed
bubbles
below
the
cap
head
eventually
settles
into
a
thin
quarter
inch
consistent
cap
with
thick
swaths
of
lacing
coating
the
glass
during
the
tasting
nose
smells
a
little
bready
with
perhaps
a
trace
of
lactose
and
cocoa
taste
reveals
cocoa
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
with
a
slightly
chalky
quality
that
comes
out
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
an
even
carbonation
and
a
slightly
silky
texture
across
the
tongue
a
nice
brew
not
something
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
but
pretty
tasty
all
and
all
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
mar
one
of
the
beers
from
samuel
adams
winter
classics
pack
pours
an
almost
black
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
minimal
lacing
aromas
of
roasted
malts
and
some
chocolate
but
less
than
i
expected
the
taste
is
where
you
get
the
full
chocolate
effect
has
a
nice
flavor
of
cocoa
and
dark
chocolate
slight
caramel
aftertaste
to
it
very
rich
i
know
this
beer
used
to
come
in
somewhat
expensive
bigger
bottles
the
12oz
bottle
seems
to
be
the
perfect
size
for
this
beer
because
i
feel
that
if
it
were
in
a
bomber
it
might
be
too
much
to
drink
at
one
time
good
beer
but
sweet
and
not
overly
drinkable
very
rich
and
heavy
with
milky
chocolate
more
like
a
milk
stout
one
and
done
for
me
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
d
a
pretty
good
brew
in
a
much
more
reasonable
package
an
interesting
beer
that
isnt
one
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
though
because
of
the
fatiguing
quality
of
the
carbonation
pours
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
hue
and
a
small
tan
head
that
fades
fast
the
smell
is
nice
and
malty
with
sweet
chocolate
notes
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
a
bit
more
potency
then
the
smell
suggest
not
a
whole
lot
of
depth
or
complexity
but
still
enjoyable
with
a
nice
sweet
chocolate
malt
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
nice
and
smooth
an
easy
drinking
chocolate
bock
tasty
and
worth
checking
out
fraid
this
beer
is
just
not
for
me
this
beer
pours
black
with
a
small
wite
head
doesnt
smell
too
good
theres
a
strong
cholcate
taste
mixed
in
with
a
cheapish
beer
taste
not
to
hard
to
drink
but
not
sure
if
id
grab
another
overall
all
not
bad
but
not
good
either
may
have
been
alot
better
as
a
stout
but
has
a
really
strong
chocholate
taste
overall
great
beer
might
have
to
buy
another
holiday
sampler
appears
very
dark
for
the
style
with
aromas
of
chocolate
bready
malts
and
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
malty
with
a
kiss
of
chocolate
syrup
alittle
bit
close
to
malted
milk
balls
fairly
sweet
but
not
overly
so
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
great
beer
to
start
the
day
with
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
delicious
beer
that
i
could
drink
very
easily
this
may
be
because
of
the
lower
abv
but
it
also
just
goes
together
very
well
its
quite
filling
id
want
to
drink
more
but
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
put
more
than
two
down
its
funny
what
beers
appeal
to
which
people
i
wasnt
sure
how
i
was
going
to
like
this
one
when
i
got
it
as
part
of
the
winter
sampler
but
i
can
honestly
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
chocolate
beers
that
i
have
had
it
pours
great
and
has
a
dark
brown
almost
black
appearance
aroma
is
great
and
hits
you
with
complexity
and
rich
chocolate
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
makes
for
a
great
winter
after
dinner
brew
for
some
they
may
find
it
a
bit
sweet
however
i
find
it
to
have
a
deep
burnt
chocolate
flavor
that
goes
down
extremely
smooth
keep
them
coming
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
with
some
retention
nose
is
strong
chocolate
and
toasted
malts
taste
follows
suit
with
milk
chocolate
dominating
the
flavor
profile
very
sweet
without
much
balance
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
too
thin
for
my
liking
for
the
style
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
overall
a
solid
brew
worth
trying
once
however
i
would
never
seek
out
a
sixpack
if
they
were
available
taste
is
a
downgrade
from
the
aroma
big
overripe
dark
fruits
dominate
the
small
chocolate
presence
and
the
chocolate
flavor
isnt
all
that
great
either
chocolate
tastes
slightly
artificial
to
me
but
the
main
issue
is
the
complete
dominance
of
the
overripe
fruit
drinkability
a
decent
chocolate
beer
but
a
sorry
bock
really
reminds
me
very
little
of
a
bock
but
the
chocolate
flavor
is
pretty
good
definitely
a
good
winter
brew
and
a
reasonable
addition
to
the
winter
mixed
pack
i
was
very
excited
when
i
saw
this
beer
in
the
winter
mix
pack
and
i
expected
more
of
a
chocolate
flavor
upfront
an
enjoyable
beer
but
could
be
better
pours
a
wonderfully
dark
brown
with
very
nice
initial
head
and
lacing
great
scent
a
nice
deep
malty
aroma
with
great
chocolate
tones
and
a
hint
of
caramel
great
flavor
chocolate
up
front
and
at
the
back
with
a
great
thick
malty
bock
caramel
and
thick
in
the
middle
goes
down
fine
but
a
bit
over
thick
perhaps
with
a
slight
alcohol
heat
still
a
wonderful
beer
and
if
you
dont
like
the
chocolate
tones
why
did
you
drink
it
d
4
makes
a
nice
dessert
beer
surprised
by
this
one
poured
into
samuel
adams
sensory
pint
glass
black
with
a
red
hue
that
can
barely
be
seen
through
even
in
bright
light
two
fingers
of
head
that
had
excellant
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
very
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
does
smell
of
chocolate
but
to
me
it
smells
like
milk
chocolate
rather
than
the
dark
sensual
bitter
chocolate
of
the
jungle
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
and
there
is
plenty
of
chocolate
but
it
is
not
very
interesting
body
is
thin
which
could
of
benefitted
by
a
lot
more
dark
malt
the
name
says
bock
but
the
label
on
the
neck
says
ale
so
what
is
it
sure
glad
i
did
not
pay
15
for
one
of
those
bottles
the
last
few
years
and
got
this
in
the
winter
seasonal
pack
very
middle
of
the
road
beer
which
is
sam
adams
specialty
wow
wow
wow
im
not
sure
what
the
price
of
this
beer
should
be
outside
of
the
winter
pack
but
if
theyd
sell
this
for
1012
for
a
6er
id
be
buying
a
case
a
year
and
aging
a
few
easily
the
best
malt
dominate
beer
ive
had
in
ages
sadly
sam
adams
makes
us
buy
a
crap
like
their
winter
lager
to
enjoy
this
wonderful
beer
a
huge
cheers
to
making
this
beer
and
a
huge
screw
you
for
only
selling
this
in
the
sample
pack
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
i
know
ill
be
drinking
more
of
these
in
the
future
overall
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
i
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
and
had
very
high
hopes
its
not
bad
in
anyway
but
its
nothing
i
would
miss
once
its
out
of
season
weaker
than
the
holiday
porter
offering
in
the
same
case
taste
is
almost
like
carbonated
milk
chocolate
with
roasted
malt
that
lends
a
hint
of
bitterness
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
isnt
overly
powerful
and
creates
a
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
slick
and
buttery
at
times
but
i
think
it
works
in
its
favor
d
very
drinkable
great
dessert
beer
though
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
d
very
drinkable
to
say
the
least
if
the
rest
of
the
winter
pack
is
as
good
as
this
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
i
was
planning
on
buying
another
pack
anyway
but
this
beer
has
pretty
much
sealed
the
deal
overall
this
is
one
of
the
few
samuel
adams
beers
that
i
can
say
i
truly
enjoy
i
like
how
this
brew
was
chocolate
first
bock
second
just
like
the
name
implies
the
best
beer
in
the
winter
pack
so
far
i
wish
this
came
in
six
packs
carbonation
is
unobtrusive
body
is
medium
to
light
drinkability
out
of
the
other
brews
ive
had
from
the
variety
pack
this
one
so
far
is
my
favorite
the
chocolate
flavor
is
good
and
theres
not
too
much
else
to
get
in
the
way
not
too
shabby
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
outstanding
here
had
i
paid
15
for
a
bottle
like
some
here
id
be
greatly
disappointed
but
this
was
part
of
the
winter
variety
pack
and
interesting
beer
but
nothing
too
special
d
i
really
liked
this
but
one
is
plenty
for
an
evening
still
this
was
a
very
happy
surprise
in
the
winter
classics
mix
great
choice
sa
d
wow
very
drinkable
the
after
taste
that
it
leaves
reminds
me
of
chocolate
milk
i
am
a
choclate
lover
so
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
very
drinkable
two
loves
chocolate
and
beer
all
in
one
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
creamy
head
quickly
dissipates
into
a
milky
haze
with
tight
lacing
smells
of
raspberries
cranberries
bread
and
sweet
milk
chocolate
taste
is
big
on
fruit
in
the
front
and
finishes
with
a
round
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
medium
drinkable
and
tasty
but
i
dont
know
if
id
have
more
than
two
in
a
night
d
i
like
chocolate
therefore
i
like
this
beer
easy
math
notes
from
the
2010
winter
pack
really
enjoyed
this
beer
especially
for
a
winter
night
loads
of
chocolate
that
was
really
tasty
slightly
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
a
slight
bitterness
sets
it
off
great
beer
that
definitely
helps
justify
getting
the
winter
pack
overall
a
very
nice
well
balanced
beer
low
alcohol
makes
it
very
drinkable
it
is
lacking
some
of
the
complexity
that
i
expected
i
get
chocolate
that
is
about
it
the
sweetness
and
soft
mouthfeel
gives
it
a
nice
round
fullness
to
it
if
sam
adams
had
this
in
6packs
i
could
see
myself
always
keeping
some
around
for
a
nice
dessert
beer
this
is
not
what
you
reach
for
if
you
want
a
refreshing
light
beer
this
is
a
sit
down
and
take
several
heavy
pulls
beer
its
too
heavy
to
really
drink
a
lot
of
but
it
would
be
great
with
a
steak
dinner
or
i
think
mexican
food
as
odd
as
that
soundsthink
mole
saucel
probably
good
to
bake
with
too
d
if
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
sweeter
flavored
beers
i
couldnt
go
for
this
however
it
is
no
where
near
the
level
of
st
choklat
so
i
could
probably
go
for
quite
a
few
of
these
would
definitely
love
to
see
it
in
a
6pack
this
one
will
remain
on
my
must
have
list
of
winter
beers
very
sweet
and
flavorful
beer
more
of
a
dessert
then
a
beer
for
beer
drink
yet
i
find
myself
drinking
this
again
someday
also
this
is
a
bock
say
what
i
enjoy
chocolate
in
beer
and
this
is
an
excellent
job
of
combining
chocolate
and
a
bock
beer
hmm
poured
aggressively
into
sierra
nevada
xxx
snifter
gave
me
only
1finger
head
pour
retention
and
barely
any
lacing
color
is
dark
dark
browntoblack
aroma
consists
of
wellbalanced
roasted
malts
a
very
small
amount
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
moderate
caramel
and
very
lightly
hopped
this
one
sips
pretty
easy
like
a
cola
especially
for
a
5
6
beer
and
no
hotness
of
alcohol
i
believe
that
this
is
actually
a
lighttomedium
bodied
beer
leaning
toward
light
but
i
havent
read
any
other
reviews
to
see
what
the
general
consensus
is
i
would
have
expected
mediumbody
the
caramel
and
roasted
malts
only
stick
around
for
a
short
while
and
fade
into
a
fairly
clean
palate
my
girlfriend
loves
this
beer
so
i
need
to
make
sure
she
gets
the
rest
of
the
chocolate
bock
in
the
sam
variety
pack
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
for
dessert
next
time
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
with
an
amber
hue
has
a
slight
tan
looking
head
to
it
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
dark
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
a
heavy
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
this
is
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
more
of
a
beer
that
you
sip
d
very
drinkalbe
to
say
the
least
grins
final
notes
im
glad
they
put
it
in
12ounce
bottles
in
the
variety
packs
this
year
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
but
its
not
worth
15
for
a
22ounce
bomber
like
its
been
in
years
past
solid
beer
id
recommend
it
as
a
dessert
beer
d
yes
please
id
definitely
enjoy
these
throughout
my
evening
and
wish
i
had
more
than
the
4
that
came
with
my
winter
sampler
pack
rich
sweet
and
comforting
describe
this
best
and
i
think
most
people
who
appreciate
a
decent
brew
will
like
this
overall
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
beer
drinkable
but
only
as
a
dessert
type
brew
not
a
session
brew
unless
you
really
like
sweet
chocolate
drinkability
pretty
effortless
and
easy
to
drink
flavor
could
get
repetitive
after
a
few
though
drinkability
well
i
passed
this
up
for
years
bu
i
finally
tried
it
snce
i
did
not
have
to
pay
15
for
a
bomber
for
it
freind
gave
me
a
12oz
form
his
mixed
case
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
have
it
again
i
like
dark
beers
with
chocolate
or
coffee
so
i
think
i
could
sip
these
all
night
long
however
its
possible
id
get
tired
of
it
after
a
couple
but
im
willing
to
find
out
i
had
avoided
this
one
for
a
few
years
with
the
fancy
metal
emblem
on
the
front
because
i
didnt
think
that
would
add
to
the
flavor
glad
i
waited
it
out
and
can
now
find
it
in
the
12
pack
thanks
sam
adams
for
coming
through
with
the
12er
nice
body
on
this
bock
and
a
great
smooth
mouthfeel
reminiscent
of
some
cask
beers
ive
had
you
know
its
in
your
mouth
but
its
soft
and
velvety
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
soda
fizz
head
that
lasts
less
than
a
minute
aromas
have
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
not
nearly
as
much
as
i
expected
with
a
dull
nondescript
maltiness
and
next
to
nothing
in
the
way
of
hops
except
maybe
a
faint
whiff
of
stale
coffee
however
this
beers
single
selling
point
its
taste
outweighs
these
initial
shortcomings
by
a
ton
very
rich
dark
malts
are
heavily
laced
with
sweet
and
bitter
chocolate
notes
from
beginning
to
end
while
not
necessarily
complex
nothing
short
of
delicious
and
in
my
humble
opinion
should
be
sipped
and
enjoyed
entirely
on
its
own
the
flavors
are
complemented
nicely
by
the
full
body
which
breaks
into
a
luxuriously
creamy
mass
on
the
midpalate
bravo
drinkability
this
is
a
dessert
beer
hands
down
it
goes
at
the
end
of
the
meal
maybe
as
the
dessert
itself
i
think
you
could
pair
it
nicely
with
a
cheeseburger
as
a
beer
version
of
a
chocolate
milkshake
but
otherwise
i
think
its
best
to
have
by
itself
at
the
end
of
a
meal
i
could
not
just
go
straight
for
this
when
i
want
a
beer
a
good
special
occasion
beer
sam
adams
please
make
six
packs
year
round
its
really
quite
a
delicious
beer
if
not
perhaps
a
little
monotonous
its
like
a
youngs
but
lighter
a
good
winter
beer
d
meh
d
pretty
good
for
a
beer
with
such
a
sweetnessi
could
do
2
maybe
but
one
is
a
treat
for
sure
drikability
comes
in
at
a
3
5
for
me
because
it
is
heavy
but
you
must
consider
what
it
is
this
beer
poured
a
very
cleardark
brown
color
with
nice
thick
fluffy
brown
head
that
hung
around
a
while
aroma
was
chocolaty
with
some
roasted
malts
and
a
little
dark
fruit
flavor
was
pretty
much
the
same
almost
an
oatmeal
stout
with
creamy
chocolate
mouth
feel
was
thinner
than
i
expected
but
i
have
to
remember
this
is
a
bock
and
not
a
stout
drinkability
was
very
high
on
this
as
the
flavor
combined
with
the
5
6abv
made
this
an
easy
drinker
had
it
with
grilled
short
ribs
and
asparagus
i
need
this
in
a
six
pack
drinkability
i
will
say
this
is
moreso
a
one
and
done
type
of
beer
though
for
what
it
is
it
is
fantastic
i
have
an
actual
2008
chocolate
bock
in
that
nifty
glassmetal
bottle
sitting
in
my
cellar
right
now
and
as
i
have
read
it
is
even
better
than
the
dumbed
down
version
that
this
is
though
i
still
think
it
tastes
great
that
i
cant
wait
to
try
for
what
it
is
it
is
a
great
beer
cheers
drinkability
overall
a
great
addition
to
the
winter
sampler
from
sam
the
looks
and
smell
are
very
mediocre
yet
once
you
taste
this
that
goes
all
out
the
door
the
chooclate
really
comes
through
nicely
on
the
backend
and
the
nice
oat
taste
really
compliments
it
in
all
fashions
with
the
atrocious
cranberry
lambic
and
coastal
wheat
out
of
this
years
mix
pack
this
beer
is
a
perfect
addition
to
complete
one
of
sams
best
mix
packs
to
date
drinkability
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
quite
enjoyable
it
holds
quite
a
good
balance
and
neither
becomes
to
sweet
or
to
dry
for
they
style
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
the
chocolate
tones
are
quite
noticeable
in
the
beginning
but
i
felt
did
kind
of
mesh
out
a
bit
in
flavor
the
more
you
had
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
that
was
glad
i
got
chance
to
try
i
realize
bocks
arent
supposed
to
be
overly
thick
or
heavy
but
a
touch
more
body
here
would
make
this
really
good
beer
outstanding
although
you
could
argue
that
it
would
no
longer
be
a
bock
plenty
of
malty
chocolate
up
front
with
medium
sweetness
that
dries
out
nicely
to
a
balanced
finish
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
adds
some
welcome
complexity
and
the
texture
isnt
at
all
bad
just
a
little
thinner
than
im
wishing
for
at
the
moment
still
within
the
style
this
gets
bonus
points
for
exceedng
expectations
the
drinkability
suffers
some
from
the
richness
it
feels
like
it
would
be
more
appropriate
for
a
bigger
beer
its
not
bad
but
it
feels
a
little
overdone
for
a
lower
abv
bock
d
a
chocolate
lovers
paradise
the
name
sure
fits
perhaps
one
of
the
most
chocolate
driven
beers
in
memory
it
really
is
quite
good
with
a
fitting
drinkability
perfect
for
this
time
of
the
year
notes
got
this
is
the
sam
adams
winter
sampler
a
lot
of
people
rip
on
this
brew
mainly
due
to
it
being
overpriced
in
stores
but
in
the
sampler
it
is
affordable
and
i
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
cheers
still
workin
my
way
through
the
winter
styles
pack
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
in
bomber
form
so
im
anxious
to
see
how
if
at
all
its
changed
since
then
it
pours
a
translucent
dark
garnetbrown
topped
by
a
shortlived
halffinger
of
pale
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
chocolate
i
know
im
shocked
too
cocoa
powder
light
coffee
molasses
light
roasted
malts
and
brown
sugar
i
think
a
vein
of
maple
syrup
and
caramel
runs
through
there
as
well
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
chocolate
really
taking
control
of
things
a
slight
cola
flavor
finds
its
way
into
the
mix
but
remains
coy
and
aloof
in
the
background
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
chocolates
affairs
the
body
is
a
svelte
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
silky
feel
overall
this
is
a
tame
version
of
the
former
glory
but
very
good
nonetheless
the
only
major
knock
against
it
is
that
its
a
tad
fizzy
for
my
liking
as
well
as
feeling
a
bit
light
beyond
that
though
im
glad
i
can
get
my
fill
of
cheap
chocolate
bock
this
winter
d
it
really
is
a
shame
i
only
got
two
because
even
if
i
could
want
a
six
pack
the
only
way
is
to
get
the
variety
case
or
half
for
19
50
and
only
get
24
still
it
was
a
very
nice
chocolate
beer
that
will
go
down
as
a
great
one
on
my
list
dthe
taste
seems
to
lose
its
quality
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
take
too
much
of
a
dive
its
a
very
thick
beer
so
it
does
seem
to
go
down
slowly
not
sure
if
id
want
to
drink
too
many
in
a
sitting
but
its
definitely
something
i
always
look
forward
to
overall
impression
meh
seems
like
a
brown
porter
with
artificial
chocolate
flavoring
glad
i
got
this
in
the
winter
pack
and
didnt
buy
it
separate
as
a
bomber
as
ive
seen
it
in
the
past
worth
trying
once
for
the
rarity
but
i
wouldnt
seek
out
again
d
this
is
by
no
means
bad
i
was
just
wanted
more
out
of
this
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
not
overly
carbonated
overally
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
desert
beer
but
the
sweetness
makes
it
a
bit
much
for
more
than
one
not
that
it
matters
because
you
only
get
two
in
the
pack
d
liquid
dessert
sweet
but
not
overpowering
if
you
like
chocolate
pie
youll
love
this
the
medium
body
and
creamy
feel
are
divine
the
chocolate
with
caramel
tones
makes
this
beer
absolutely
delicious
it
gets
better
with
each
sip
as
it
warms
up
perfect
holiday
beer
deep
complex
sweet
flavors
one
of
the
best
balanced
dessert
beers
ive
ever
had
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
much
more
reasonable
to
offer
this
in
the
winter
12
pack
than
in
an
overpriced
22
oz
bomber
like
in
years
past
i
wish
the
chocolate
flavor
was
a
little
less
fake
tasting
but
i
wont
complain
as
it
still
tastes
delicious
this
is
a
really
excellent
chocolate
beer
its
almost
cocoalike
in
its
flavor
profile
overall
a
pretty
good
substitute
for
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
thats
basically
what
this
reminds
me
of
not
sure
which
one
i
like
better
this
gets
the
chocolate
part
down
better
while
the
other
might
get
the
malt
down
better
however
i
do
like
the
subtle
hops
in
this
overall
not
a
bad
ale
at
all
perhaps
it
has
been
improved
some
over
time
as
i
have
read
through
some
of
the
old
reviews
pretty
good
stuff
and
holds
up
to
a
lot
of
the
chocolate
stouts
and
porters
out
there
i
pour
this
from
a
12oz
bottle
in
to
a
samuel
adams
glass
the
appearance
was
a
pitch
black
not
much
head
on
this
one
there
is
a
faint
smell
of
cocoa
the
taste
is
of
cocoa
but
not
overly
sweet
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
thin
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
hearty
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
overall
i
really
like
the
flavor
but
i
expected
this
to
be
a
bit
heavier
d
okay
i
admit
this
is
very
lacking
in
the
bock
characteristics
however
the
flavor
and
aroma
just
take
it
over
the
top
imo
regardless
of
what
style
this
beer
is
its
just
fantastic
awesome
full
complex
flavor
along
with
a
great
aroma
i
really
wish
sam
adams
made
this
available
in
a
6
pak
d
hm
well
not
bad
although
i
expected
something
richer
tasting
like
a
stout
although
it
is
a
bock
i
could
drink
a
few
for
sure
pretty
drinkable
a
couple
things
i
didnt
like
about
the
beer
is
that
the
c02
was
too
high
just
too
crisp
and
the
smell
was
very
soft
other
than
that
id
definitely
drink
it
again
but
maybe
not
buy
it
again
worth
a
try
though
cheers
id
be
interested
to
know
how
this
beer
is
brewed
it
has
a
lactose
quality
almost
as
if
cream
or
some
other
malted
ingredient
was
added
besides
barleymalted
cocoa
its
an
ok
bock
overall
too
full
of
one
flavor
for
my
liking
though
d
if
i
was
having
a
stout
tasting
i
would
serve
a
beer
like
this
to
some
who
1
doesnt
like
stouts
2
has
to
drive
home
afterward
or
3
isnt
a
huge
beer
fan
i
definitely
understand
the
crowd
this
beer
is
aimed
at
for
me
its
not
great
but
its
pretty
good
a
nice
addition
to
the
winter
seasonal
pack
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
it
isnt
great
but
is
certainly
a
nice
beer
i
like
the
price
of
the
12
pack
better
than
the
price
of
the
original
bombers
d
rare
occasion
that
i
will
want
this
too
sweet
for
me
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
but
im
not
sure
if
ill
be
back
pours
a
nice
and
dark
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
combination
of
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
has
a
nice
slightly
bitter
finish
a
good
beer
for
the
upcoming
winter
it
is
a
welcome
addition
to
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
a
suitable
replacement
for
cranberry
lambic
pours
out
a
dark
brown
with
a
rich
tan
head
some
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
is
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
some
sweet
malts
and
mild
smoke
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
has
a
depth
of
chocolate
flavor
and
some
tobacco
leaf
and
mild
bitter
hop
not
too
much
going
on
with
the
hops
but
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
i
am
no
stranger
to
chocolate
beer
in
fact
rogue
chocolate
stout
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
this
beer
is
somewhat
similar
but
more
malty
than
bittersweet
or
hoppy
like
that
brew
not
nearly
as
much
depth
of
flavor
but
to
be
fair
i
am
comparing
a
bock
in
the
lager
family
to
a
full
blown
ale
stout
also
there
is
no
residual
chocolate
floating
around
in
this
filtered
beer
which
is
a
mild
disappointment
in
the
mouthfeel
department
yes
i
want
to
drink
my
dessert
in
the
form
of
beer
but
should
i
expect
that
from
a
company
that
filters
all
of
their
beers
overall
this
is
one
drinkable
bock
and
i
am
glad
that
the
sampler
pack
included
it
this
year
a
well
put
together
beer
i
like
this
more
than
i
used
to
and
its
a
welcome
addition
to
the
winter
mixpack
drinkability
glad
i
waited
until
this
was
in
the
winter
sampler
because
this
beer
is
nowhere
near
worth
the
15
bones
a
bomber
they
wanted
for
it
the
last
couple
years
so
i
bought
the
winter
pack
just
for
this
beer
not
bad
overall
but
im
really
glad
i
didnt
shell
out
1215
for
it
before
when
it
was
in
the
really
cool
bottles
pours
opaque
black
with
a
bit
of
brown
head
smell
is
chocolatecocoa
powder
really
with
maybe
a
hint
of
roast
behind
it
taste
is
ok
big
cocoa
notes
some
bitterness
in
line
with
some
darker
chocolate
flavors
and
some
toasted
malt
something
in
it
doesnt
jive
with
me
however
almost
a
chalky
or
flat
taste
to
the
chocolate
mf
is
mediumthis
would
benefit
from
a
bit
more
body
and
a
bit
less
carbonation
overall
a
drinkable
beer
just
not
my
favorite
definitely
better
than
cranberry
lambic
however
good
stuff
d
certainly
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
think
they
might
have
missed
the
mark
a
little
on
the
original
concept
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
is
also
very
solid
a
great
brew
from
the
winter
sampler
by
sam
adams
this
years
brew
has
a
2
higher
abv
then
its
previous
brews
so
it
might
be
a
little
hard
for
some
but
its
still
pretty
low
that
you
could
enjoy
this
brew
more
then
once
maybe
not
a
session
beer
but
still
great
surely
wouldnt
pass
this
one
up
d
the
lack
of
complexity
makes
drinking
more
than
one
a
nonstarter
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
a
little
heavy
but
goes
down
nicely
not
very
drinkableits
good
to
try
though
d
why
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
i
would
still
go
out
and
seek
it
every
once
in
awhile
i
still
like
this
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
solid
and
when
taken
in
combination
with
the
whole
brew
reminds
me
of
a
chocolate
milkshake
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
well
done
beer
although
i
would
probably
have
categorized
it
as
a
porter
drinkability
might
get
heavy
feeling
after
a
few
but
they
go
down
good
overall
this
is
a
decent
chocolate
beer
it
doesnt
really
wow
me
in
the
sense
of
being
a
good
bock
and
if
it
were
only
thicker
it
would
improve
significantly
not
bad
though
wow
it
really
does
smell
like
chocolate
smells
like
a
hersheys
bar
pretty
much
the
taste
is
the
same
way
with
that
milk
chocolate
but
its
so
smooth
its
ridiculous
maybe
a
little
bit
more
hops
and
carbonation
could
have
made
it
more
beer
like
but
im
not
complaining
samuel
adams
has
plenty
of
other
beers
that
mix
the
malt
and
hops
amazingly
dont
get
me
wrong
though
this
beer
does
have
hops
in
it
just
subtle
and
as
it
warms
you
can
actually
taste
the
full
potential
of
this
beer
this
one
is
exactly
what
the
title
says
chocolate
bock
this
beer
is
amazing
for
the
style
and
im
glad
they
put
this
in
the
winter
12
pack
d
a
decent
brew
that
fits
in
the
winter
sampler
well
reminds
me
a
little
of
youngs
double
chocolate
minus
the
crazy
amount
of
chocolate
flavor
d
really
smooth
drink
good
flavor
and
nice
mix
in
for
the
winter
pack
would
suggest
this
one
as
a
stand
alone
but
also
with
a
nice
hearty
meal
maybe
some
steak
d
overall
a
great
choc
bock
one
or
two
is
enough
its
quite
heavy
but
i
like
that
for
those
cold
winter
nights
drink
up
cheers
md
slick
mouthfeel
but
liqueur
like
i
like
it
tough
drinkability
though
i
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
more
than
one
d
while
not
cloyingly
sweet
i
could
see
how
drinking
more
then
23
of
these
would
be
too
much
not
a
problem
as
there
were
only
2
in
the
pack
worth
grabbing
as
the
other
beers
are
pretty
good
too
of
all
the
sam
adams
beers
i
have
tried
this
is
perhaps
the
most
interesting
it
pours
a
rich
brown
color
with
a
scent
of
cocoa
it
drinks
rather
smooth
as
carbonation
tickles
your
tastebuds
picking
up
hints
of
dark
chocolate
in
the
taste
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
beer
or
a
treat
definetly
the
next
best
thing
to
hot
chocolate
on
a
cold
night
drinkability
while
interesting
it
just
doesnt
mesh
as
well
as
i
had
hoped
the
lackluster
appearance
certainly
does
not
help
my
generosity
when
reviewing
i
actually
find
it
hard
to
finish
i
hope
this
beer
comes
out
in
6packs
soon
definitely
not
the
best
chocolate
flavored
beer
but
certainly
a
good
look
for
sam
adams
i
dont
go
for
chocolate
type
beers
but
if
its
from
sam
adams
i
have
to
give
it
a
shot
got
it
in
the
holiday
pack
not
overpowering
with
chocolate
but
has
a
typical
bock
bite
the
finish
is
really
smooth
as
one
would
expect
out
of
a
chocolate
beer
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
but
still
very
good

i
think
that
this
is
a
perfect
addition
to
the
sam
adams
winter
mix
pack
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
little
head
there
is
slight
lacing
around
the
top
of
my
glass
the
aroma
is
vaguely
choclatey
kind
of
similar
to
a
cold
cup
of
cocoa
the
taste
is
choclatey
and
pretty
much
better
than
a
youngs
in
my
opinion
more
of
a
novelty
taste
still
a
great
beer
to
talk
about
over
a
christmas
family
gathering
overall
a
nice
brew
cocoa
mildly
sweet
is
center
stage
with
decent
malts
and
hops
to
finish
it
d
a
highly
drinkable
bock
which
i
was
expecting
to
be
way
too
heavy
on
the
cocoa
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
balance
and
depth
of
flavor
all
this
with
a
relatively
light
abv
make
for
easy
drinking
i
wish
there
were
more
then
2
in
the
mix
pack
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
beer
generally
a
chocolate
beer
at
such
low
alcohol
is
thin
bland
and
boring
chocolate
bock
is
anything
but
i
think
sam
adams
has
perfected
or
even
invented
a
style
here
that
i
happy
to
be
a
part
of
go
team
chocolate
bock
anyday
cheers
d
the
brew
is
very
drinkable
the
problem
is
the
beer
is
not
as
tasty
as
i
wanted
overall
this
beer
backs
up
what
it
preaches
chocolate
im
23
through
the
bottle
and
i
can
feel
its
cloyingness
but
the
hops
to
help
cleanse
the
palate
a
little
bit
id
like
to
split
a
12
oz
bottle
and
serve
a
couple
snifters
of
it
to
company
during
the
holidays
i
bet
it
would
get
goodgreat
feedback
serve
in
place
of
a
chocolate
liqueur
would
be
my
recommendation
d
this
is
really
great
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
fresh
again
this
year
cant
say
its
worth
1314
but
it
is
tasty
tasted
from
750ml
bottle
at
lush
roscoe
pours
a
super
dark
amber
with
a
medium
grayish
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
around
the
glass
nose
is
malted
chocolate
milk
with
dark
roasted
malts
and
even
more
milk
chocolate
flavors
are
very
similar
to
the
nose
with
milk
chocolate
and
very
dark
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
body
is
creamy
but
not
super
heavy
with
light
carbonation
and
a
long
roasted
finish
if
you
could
find
this
beer
please
try
it
drinkability
for
how
dark
the
beer
is
its
really
fantastic
this
beer
was
basically
the
easiest
drinking
stout
ive
ever
had
i
gave
it
a
low
score
because
for
that
price
tag
i
was
expecting
much
more
this
one
needs
to
be
aged
in
barrels
to
become
a
better
beer
the
alcohol
content
was
dissapointing
as
well
because
it
was
so
low
couldnt
age
this
one
better
luck
next
time
samuel
adams
overall
i
like
it
perhaps
because
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
it
is
not
as
complicated
on
the
palette
nor
as
pleasurable
as
the
scottish
stout
for
example
but
it
is
pleasing
and
somewhat
smooth
i
doubt
id
have
another
because
i
could
get
a
scottish
stout
for
the
same
price
or
just
leap
to
the
founders
kentucky
breakfast
stout
for
superior
taste
and
experience
i
applaud
sam
adams
for
experimenting
i
for
one
appreciate
it
as
one
of
the
biglittle
guys
of
american
brewing
drinkability
all
in
all
it
wasnt
a
bad
investment
it
was
definitely
worth
a
try
would
i
buy
it
again
no
i
dont
think
i
would
this
beer
was
very
nicely
packaged
and
i
tried
not
to
hold
that
against
it
i
had
seen
this
beer
many
times
and
did
not
pick
it
up
until
it
was
on
closeout
3
25
a
bottle
and
i
really
expected
more
from
it
taste
is
surprisingly
a
bit
boozy
for
such
a
low
abv
mouthfeel
is
also
a
bit
light
and
watery
otherwise
its
great
nice
chocolate
after
taste
that
lingers
and
is
very
authentic
as
it
should
be
with
real
cocoa
cool
beer
that
holds
up
with
age
i
found
it
on
close
out
in
ny
for
8
so
worth
it
for
that
price
point
libation
i
really
hoped
for
something
great
here
a
reserve
beer
such
as
this
aged
in
real
chocolate
nibs
for
nearly
15
sounds
like
recipe
for
quality
unfortunately
its
just
too
sweet
and
not
complex
enough
overall
the
product
does
not
live
up
to
the
beautiful
packaging
nor
the
price
tag
this
isnt
bad
but
for
a
better
price
there
are
better
bocks
out
there
and
beers
that
better
satisfy
a
chocolate
tooth
also
smooth
creamy
toasty
somewhat
chewy
and
warming
in
the
throat
very
nice
but
expected
more
than
i
received
interesting
to
try
but
would
probably
not
get
this
one
again
rather
pricey
i
was
surprised
samuel
adams
came
out
with
so
much
hype
about
this
beer
it
isnt
that
amazing
along
with
the
utopias
i
am
again
unimpressed
by
samuel
adams
and
their
specialty
beers
i
am
a
keen
fan
of
almost
every
samuel
adams
line
there
is
besides
their
specialty
lines
such
as
this
one
this
beer
the
chocolate
bock
looks
awesome
its
ominous
and
intriguing
even
up
to
the
point
that
you
our
it
into
a
glass
of
some
sort
this
beverage
looks
amazing
but
it
was
the
taste
that
threw
me
off
i
got
an
essence
of
chocolate
no
doubt
but
there
was
layers
of
thick
flavor
that
could
have
done
without
while
i
did
finish
the
beer
i
was
highly
unimpressed
while
i
wont
say
its
my
worst
beer
i
ever
had
its
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
from

pours

14
inch

a
pale

decent
retention
and
good

smells
of
chocolate
up

then
slight
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
and
yeast
in
the
finish
fits
the
style
of
a
bock
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
chocolate
yeast
slight
roasted
malt
and
sweet
malt
overall
the
body
improves
as
it
warms
but
then
the
chocolate
becomes
overpoweringly
sweet
great
atmosphere
deep
dark
pristine
appearance
full
hearty
nose
flavor
is
a
great
balance
of
deep
dark
malt
and
bittersweet
chocolate
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
d
easy
to
drink
nice
sipper
overall
to
be
honest
i
bought
this
because
of
the
bottle
looks
nice
but
i
will
not
buy
this
again
much
better

to
be
had

the

drinkability
this
went
down
a

easier
than
i
thought
i
just
felt
there
was
a
complexity
that
was
missing
for
the
price
i
was
able
to
get

for

otherwise
it
was
a
stretch

a
sam

perfect
pint
glass
pours
a
brownamber
color
that
comes
out
about
as
light
a
brown
as
it
can
possibly
be
without
being
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
a
chocolate
moose
or
nougat
color
with
some
lacing
to
it
that
goes
away
after
a
bit
while
your
drinking
it
id
say
its
better
than
average
but
when
finished
the
glass
only
has
little
splotches
of
lacing
the
smell
is
good
but
not
quite
as
chocolaty
as
i
expected
really
more
of
a
cocoa
or
nestle
quick
type
mix
its
really
not
very
strong
i
enjoyed
the
taste
again
not
quite
as
chocolaty
as
i
expected
but
there
was
a
chocolate
taste
that
was
present
throughout
there
is
a
coco
taste
present
but
also
some
bitter
chocolate
for
the
aftertaste
also
some
roasted
malt
taste
very
present
i
find
that
in
many
bock
style
beers
the
alcohol
taste
can
be
strong
but
not
in
this
one
i
found
the
mouthfeel
to
be
very
good
on
this
its
better
as
it
warms
up
but
not
bad
cold
either
i
find
it
very
light
bodied
which
is
rare
for
any
chocolate
style
beer
that
ive
ever
tried
there
was
absolutely
no
carbonation
or
alcohol
bite
to
this
at
all
i
also
found
this
beer
incredibly
drinkable
cold
and
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
it
was
a
bit
pricey
though
so
i
dont
know
if
ill
ever
get
it
again
ill
most
likely
save
the
bottle
its
cool
looking
the
feel
to
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
medium
bodied
bock
with
a
pretty
light
feel
with
some
wisps
of
alcohol
that
does
tend
to
make
this
beer
feel
heavier
at
times
d
i
was
surprised
with
how
light
this
was
and
the
low
abv
which
help
the
drinkability
i
liked
the
chocolate
presence
in
this
one
but
the
malts
were
a
little
too
roasted
for
me
overall
a
decent
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
the
mouthfeel
was
mostly
light
even
with
the
dark
appearance
and
although
the
drinkability
was
good
i
expected
more
from
sam
ddrinkability
well
its
ok
it
kind
of
fun
and
not
a
drainpour
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
give
jim
kudos
for
trying
something
different
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
another
anytime
soon
i
mean
sheesh
i
can
buy
2
750s
of
chimay
for
the
price
of
this
d
awesome
samuel
adams
chocolate
bock
is
a
clear
dark
red
lager
with
a
small
dense
yellowish
light
beige
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
it
has
a
tart
aroma
thats
a
little
sweet
and
chocolaty
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
slick
oily
finish
it
has
a
nice
tart
bock
flavor
with
plenty
of
dry
roasty
chocolate
and
a
note
of
vanilla
its
really
clean
and
tasty
verdict
unfortunately
chocolate
bock
falls
a
little
short
its
not
much
more
than
a
middleoftheroad
bock
with
some
mild
chocolate
flavors
mixed
in
while
this
would
work
as
part
of
a
mixed
twelvepack
this
750ml
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
the
over
ten
dollar
price
tag
cheers
doesnt
have
a
very
disticnt
aroma
or
flavor
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
its
not
necessarily
for
me
i
wonder
how
the
bottle
i
tried
would
compare
to
a
fresher
bottle
this
ranks
as
one
of
the
most
complex
bock
beers
i
have
tried
the
bottle
i
tried
had
a
best
by
date
of
april
2009
3
months
later
id
say
it
still
holds
up
i
enjoyed
this
enough
that
it
would
warrant
another
purchase
d
excellent
chocolate
beer
slightly
different
from
your
typical
chocolate
stouts
the
bock
style
lends
itself
nicely
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
sam
adams
on
this
one
very
drinkable
and
a
ton
of
flavors
i
know
this
beer
isnt
worth
15
at
regular
price
but
on
clearance
it
is
a
pretty
fair
deal
i
shared
this
with
the
family
and
they
even
liked
it
enjoyable
but
not
something
for
every
day
very
good
flavor
and
balance
nice
5

this
one
is
a
keeper
if
it
werent
so
pricey
it
could
be
a
very
nice
session

poured
a

that
produced

chocolate

not

sweet

cocoa
caramel
and

mouthfeel
was
smooth
and

good
brew
but
not
worth
the
bucks
you
cough
up
to
get
it
shared
this
earlier
tonight
with
a
friend
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
thick
beige
head
that
didnt
fade
too
quickly
and
left
decent
lacing
smelled
of
roasted
chocolate
malts
with
hints
of
caramel
and
coffee
tasted
like
chocolate
up
front
with
a
nice
malty
finish
pretty
smooth
and
i
would
love
to
drink
more
if
it
werent
for
the
price
tag
samuel
adams
chocolate
bock
may
not
be
worth
the
price
tag
but
its
certainly
deserving
of
a
little
praise
the
caramel
toasty
melanoidins
and
chocolate
worked
if
i
were
in
charge
at
the
brewery
i
would
leave
the
recipe
just
as
is
and
change
nothing
but
the
price
this
is
something
id
be
more
likely
to
buy
regularly
than
as
a
special
occasion
beer
this
was
a
christmas
gift
that
was
bb
april
2009
suddenly
i
know
why
premier
gourmet
had
this
on
sale
in
march
in
any
event
there
is
a
fizzy
tan
head
initially
atop
a
colablack
liquid
soon
only
a
ring
is
left
smell
was
of
chocolate
almonds
not
overly
sweet
i
thought
the
body
was
sufficiently
smooth
nice
texture
a
lit
thin
in
the
body
smell
and
taste
were
best
soon
after
opening
air
did
not
seem
to
develop
much
beyond
that
still
i
thought
that
the
first
half
of
this
beer
was
delightful
with
hot
chocolate
notes
cocoa
beans
well
balanced
and
not
too
sweet
there
was
also
a
toasted
malty
backbone
that
complimented
the
chocolate
notes
with
air
and
warming
it
went
a
bit
flat
and
the
lovely
flavours
were
less
pronounced
too
bad
i
didnt
pick
some
up
on
sale
in
march
exceedingly
drinkable
pours
a
deep
brownblack
color
with
a
strong
tanbrown
head
leaving
lots
of
sticking
roasty
toasty
malt
nose
sweet
bakers
chocolate
not
overly
sweet
in
flavor
but
a
bit
too
metallic
the
slightest
tang
of
bitterness
on
the
end
simple
and
boardering
one
dimensional
well
made
for
sure
but
way
over
priced
d
this
is
what
it
is
a
chocolate
bock
would
work
very
well
as
a
desert
beer
it
found
it
on
sale
for
10
99
but
its
still
overpriced
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
because
of
the
way
it
sits
in
your
mouth
worth
a
try
a
decent
bock
beer
and
fun
to
try
i
think
this
beer
gets
a
bit
underrated
because
it
doesnt
deliver
the
heavy
chocolate
that
its
name
suggests
instead
of
being
a
chocolate
bomb
this
has
balanced
flavors
of
chocolate
hazelnut
caramel
and
fruity
yeast
medium
bodied
but
surprisingly
creamy
a
bit
too
syrupysweet
to
session
impressive
body
and
flavor
for
a
5
5
brew
pretty
drinkable
with
its
body
the
chocolate
makes
it
smooth
d
high
despite
the
high
abv
tasty
so
im
glad
it
is
a
big
bottle
and
im
the
only
one
drinking
it
samuel
adams
chocolate
bock
is
one
of
the
most
overpriced
beers
that
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
im
sure
the
brewing
process
was
expensive
not
to
mention
the
packaging
but
15
for
a
barely
aboveaverage
brew
is
about
twice
as
much
as
its
worth
it
doesnt
matter
though
because
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
at
any
price
mdlight
body
but
some
creaminess
in
the
mouth
md
carbonation
the
flavors
of
this
beer
are
so
delicate
that
i
wish
for
a
little
less
carbonation
nice
but
i
can
think
of
other
things
id
prefer
to
spend
my
15
on
chocolate
bock
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
cant
say
i
had
high
hopes
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
better
than
it
is
theres
simply
not
enough
flavor
here
it
starts
out
nicely
but
needs
some
intermediate
development
to
carry
it
through
that
being
said
its
pretty
good
and
far
from
a
disaster
worth
checking
once
if
you
run
across
it
its
overpriced
and
not
worth
purchasing
multiple
bottles
come
to
think
of
it
the
bottles
the
nicest
thing
about
it
d
its
a
sipper
but
a
very
good
one
light
enough
to
drink
for
a
while
im
glad
they
offered
this
one
as
part
of
the
tasting
as
id
been
hesitant
to
drop
15
on
a
bottle
very
enjoyable
and
well
crafted
beer
easy
to
consume
a
little
pricey
for
a
bock
beer
but
whos
counting
drinkability
well
this
isnt
worth
eighteen
dollars
i
wish
it
was
a
little
higher
alcohol
and
had
a
bit
more
balance
but
its
fascinating
the
things
that
sam
adams
will
try
and
its
amazing
that
they
even
got
something
drinkable
out
of
this
kind
of
mix
d
at
15
bucks
this
is
a
steeply
priced
brew
but
man
is
it
good
i
think
it
gets
a
bad
rap
because
of
the
price
tag
i
will
admit
it
is
overpriced
but
its
definitely
still
a
fantastic
chocolate
bock
great
drinkability
dark
brown
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
cocoa
taste
is
chocolatemalts
and
molasses
it
has
a
mouthfeel
similar
to
soda
yet
it
doesnt
spoil
the
overall
drinking
of
the
beer
i
paid
15
99
for
750mli
would
only
buy
again
at
half
that
price
worth
at
least
one
shot
i
have
heard
very
good
things
about
this
brew
and
am
left
wondering
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
if
this
is
it
it
doesnt
live
up
to
its
hype
i
think
that
the
real
hinderance
of
this
beer
is
the
price
i
dont
see
this
750
ml
being
worth
the
15
or
whatever
it
is
i
think
i
picked
it
up
for
10
or
12
on
sale
the
biggest
fault
this
beer
has
is
its
price
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
overall
but
for
an
average
running
price
of
16
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
another
i
actually
found
this
bottle
for
14
which
still
isnt
low
enough
to
make
me
want
to
buy
another
d
liquid
chocolate
dessert
definitely
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
low
and
the
taste
is
incredible
the
worldclass
swiss
chocolate
was
not
wasted
on
this
brew
the
character
comes
through
and
is
showcased
in
the
aroma
and
taste
my
issue
with
this
beer
is
the
whole
bock
classification
this
is
not
a
bock
just
call
it
chocolate
stout
what
is
wrong
with
that
name
sam
adams
just
likes
to
call
dark
beers
bocks
like
triple
bock
right
lovely
bottle
i
have
happy
to
see
the
variety
of
offerings
increase
next
door
at
my
local
market
i
picked
up
this
one
as
i
had
yet
to
sample
one
though
plenty
of
opportunities
had
been
evident
prior
a
dark
smooth
toffee
pour
to
near
black
with
2
finger
orangeybrown
decent
head
atop
an
unexpectedly
fruit
aroma
with
white
chocolate
powdered
cocoa
not
as
sweet
as
i
might
have
feared
at
first
and
rather
tasty
i
would
only
switch
the
cocoataste
for
some
more
dark
chocolate
but
otherwise
a
fine
one
d
decent
but
for
15
i
wont
be
back
d
enjoyable
could
drink
another
but
the
price
is
very
hard
to
swallow
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
that
werent
quite
met
its
way
overpckaged
and
way
overpriced
product
does
not
justify
the
price
i
like
the
packaging
though
i
think
its
goodlooking
and
not
overdone
but
i
wouldnt
pay
another
15
for
this
beer
theres
just
way
better
things
to
spend
money
on
i
have
one
more
of
them
and
im
gonna
let
it
sit
for
a
while
before
i
touch
it
drinkability
due
to
the
high
price
and
the
bitterness
i
might
have
this
occasionally
but
i
wont
find
myself
buying
this
again
in
the
bottle
form
the
chocolate
and
beer
can
both
be
overpowering
at
times
and
thus
is
hard
for
me
to
enjoy
smelled
a
bit
malty
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
tasted
i
thought
much
like
dogfish
theobroma
which
is
to
say
a
light
cocoa
especially
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
oily
and
a
bit
thin
for
a
porter
but
overall
a
decent
beer
id
would
buy
another
for
10
at
a
clearance
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
the
price
will
prevent
me
from
picking
up
another
one
d
you
have
got
to
be
kidding
me
i
am
having
trouble
getting
through
a
glass
d
pleasant
beer
to
drink
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
then
i
would
pick
this
up
every
so
often
way
too
expensive
for
a
mediocre
5
6
abv
brew
drinkability
more
like
a
dessert
beer
than
anything
else
better
than
anticipated
but
not
really
bocklike
d
it
drinks
fine
hell
i
would
even
have
another
one
d
great
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
assuming
i
was
allowed
to
at
work
overall
it
wasnt
bad
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
again
at
some
point
750
ml
bottle
purchased
from
la
bodega
in
riverside
for
seventeen
bucks
currently
splitting
with
dane
poured
into
my
urthel
glass
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
12
inch
creamy
light
tan
head
with
bad
retention
no
lacing
either
aroma
is
milk
chocolate
that
is
pretty
overwhelming
light
hops
lots
of
malt
earthiness
and
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
an
even
heavier
reliance
on
cocoa
too
much
for
me
once
it
warms
some
vanilla
comes
out
later
on
to
add
to
the
already
overly
sweet
beer
some
fruit
by
the
end
too
needed
some
dry
qualities
to
balance
things
out
sweet
chocolately
and
slightly
earthy
mouthfeel
thin
bodied
do
not
be
deceived
by
its
color
taste
lingers
too
long
with
sweetness
could
not
drink
more
than
ten
to
twelve
ounces
heavy
and
quite
filling
not
smooth
lacks
complexity
glad
this
got
brewed
again
and
i
was
able
to
try
it
this
time
around
but
it
is
not
really
my
thing
especially
not
for
the
money
would
probably
skip
in
the
future
still
worth
trying
i
would
imagine
this
would
be
more
enjoyable
on
tap
im
sure
the
price
tag
reflects
the
glitzy
bottle
appearance
some
chocolate
does
come
through
in
aroma
but
not
the
taste
some
unusual
tastes
do
come
through
like
vanilla
and
sweet
figs
rather
than
the
traditional
layers
of
malts
absolutely
not
worth
the
money
try
again
sam
adams
a
much
better
beer
than
i
expected
drinkability
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
a
real
good
example
of
the
style
and
certainly
not
worth
the
price
but
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
this
beer
was
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
a
nice
chocolaty
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
however
i
do
not
think
its
worth
the
high
price
since
there
are
several
other
comparable
chocolateflavored
beers
out
there
overall
i
was
surprised
that
sam
adams
was
able
to
pull
something
like
this
off
it
was
extreme
for
a
lager
but
i
would
reach
for
the
4packs
of
sam
adams
imperial
pilsner
before
this
expensive
beer
dno
thanks
ill
have
a
youngs
and
get
4
for
alot
less
mouth
is
thin
i
would
never
in
my
life
spend
16
dollars
for
a
bottle
d
a
good
beer
not
a
slammer
but
more
of
a
sipper
this
brew
needs
to
be
cherished
d
samuel
adams
chocolate
bock
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
would
make
a
great
desert
beer
it
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
i
thought
this
beer
was
disappointing
i
was
pretty
happy
when
i
heard
about
it
as
i
love
chocolate
stouts
and
think
boston
beer
is
a
great
company
however
i
thought
this
beer
was
beta
version
the
carbonation
seemed
off
and
it
had
a
slight
metallic
flavor
the
beer
was
lacking
mouthfeel
too
i
think
it
has
potential
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
for
a
while
there
are
numerous
chocolate
stouts
out
there
that
blow
this
one
away
stone
young
rogue
to
name
a
few
d
ive
had
an
entire
bottle
of
this
before
but
wouldnt
want
more
than
that
a
good
beer
but
not
enogh
there
to
keep
me
wanting
more
overall
a
very
nice
chocolate
bockschwarzy
thing
from
sa
the
biggest
issue
with
this
beer
is
its
outrageous
price
this
is
a
good
brew
and
i
like
the
touch
of
chocolate
in
it
but
when
i
can
buy
a
sixer
of
their
black
lager
for
nearly
half
the
price
there
is
no
way
i
will
reach
for
this
again
a
good
tasty
and
well
crafted
dark
german
brew
though
pours
with
a
one
finger
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
chocolate
and
raisins
in
the
nose
tastes
ok
but
i
was
expecting
a
more
pronounced
chocolate
flavor
in
a
beer
labeled
chocolate
bock
flavor
was
not
as
crisp
as
usual
for
lagers
makes
me
wonder
if
they
use
a
lager
yeast
reads
ale
with
cocoa
and
natural
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
chocolate
beer
drinkable
but
i
did
not
want
any
more
when
i
finished
my
glass
way
overpriced
for
what
you
get
for
my
money
youngs
chocolate
stout
rogue
chocolate
stout
or
stone
bitter
chocolate
imperial
stout
are
all
better
examples
of
chocolate
flavored
beers
poured
into
a
tulip
a
very
nice
looking
black
color
nice
carbonation
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
minimal
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
sweet
caramel
chocolate
toffee
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
nice
notes
of
chocolatetoffee
some
vanilla
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
brew
but
not
worth
the
price
tag
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
though
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
creamy
tan
head
sweet
caramel
chocolate
and
toasty
malt
aroma
flavor
of
sweet
chocolate
with
hints
of
vanilla
caramel
and
faint
molassas
medium
full
body
with
moderately
low
carbonation
and
a
rather
creamy
finish
for
a
bock
good
but
awful
expensive
for
what
it
is
flavors
are
not
at
all
overwhelming
quite
drinkable
roasty
and
toasty
subtle
notes
complement
the
cocoa
well
somewhat
creamy
and
milky
feeling
in
the
mouth
but
at
the
same
time
thin
bodied
would
not
want
to
follow
an
imperial
stout
or
ipa
with
this
beer
as
the
flavors
are
truly
subtle
overpriced
yes
but
definitely
tasty
a
good
beer
very
clean
with
a
nice
mellow
chocolate
taste
i
kind
of
wish
there
was
more
legs
to
this
baby
especially
considering
if
costs
about
16
a
bottle
which
is
fucking
ridiculous
luckily
i
didnt
pay
for
this
i
love
the
chocolate
specks
in
it
very
cool
would
pair
great
with
any
subtle
dessert
so
as
not
to
overpower
it
d
decent
smokey
chocolate
brew
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
a
worthwhile
drink
for
the
winter
a
bit
more
bittering
hop
here
wouldve
done
this
one
well
had
this
one
after
shoveling
the
driveway
was
a
nice
refreshing
alternative
to
a
hot
cocoa
the
real
accomplishment
is
the
purity
of
the
chocolate
flavor
and
for
those
who
believe
its
thin
on
mouthfeel
its
a
bock
with
5
6
abv
what
did
you
expect
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
i
will
crave
or
likely
ever
sample
again
chocolate
beer
ok
done
that
dont
need
a
second
one
d
very
good
but
way
to
expensive
to
ever
buy
one
again
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
tannish
slightly
foamy
head
that
retains
for
a
bit
not
much
lacing
the
the
ruby
notes
on
the
beer
shine
in
the
light
the
nose
on
the
beer
is
slight
but
there
is
a
clear
note
of
chalky
cocoa
powder
and
a
tad
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
is
very
caramel
laden
somewhat
creamy
quite
astringent
and
sharp
in
places
not
a
great
deal
of
carbonation
and
some
cocoa
hints
towards
the
finish
the
beer
gets
more
chocolatey
as
it
settles
but
there
is
not
an
overpowering
or
very
distinct
chocolate
flavor
to
the
beer
this
is
a
bock
beer
for
sure
with
the
slightly
syrupy
caramel
consistency
the
slightly
soury
aftertaste
and
finish
and
with
this
beer
the
chocolate
hints
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
warranting
the
high
price
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
return
there
either
d
great
beer
i
like
it
and
the
fact
that
it
is
as
thin
and
light
on
the
alcohol
it
makes
it
very
drinkable
d
it
was
too
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
the
whole
750
ml
bottle
i
enjoy
sweeter
bocks
but
this
was
too
much
a
good
dessert
beer
but
only
one
for
me
md
the
feel
is
astringent
and
slightly
dry
with
some
bite
but
relatively
good
it
is
however
filling
and
slow
to
drink
but
savory
with
this
offering
i
truly
felt
the
chocolate
label
was
taken
literally
its
a
sweet
chocolate
concoction
which
made
me
think
more
along
the
lines
of
a
flavored
alcoholic
beverage
rather
than
a
dark
chocolaty
but
wellbalanced
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
without
becoming
bored
of
it
were
it
not
for
the
exhorbant
price
first
i
have
to
admit
i
have
only
tried
2
other
chocolate
beers
youngs
double
and
brooklyns
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
was
definitely
very
sweet
and
tasted
more
like
milk
chocolate
to
me
rather
than
dark
i
can
see
how
most
people
would
feel
that
it
had
an
artificial
taste
to
i
would
probably
recommend
it
for
dessert
and
to
be
really
savored
i
had
this
beer
at
a
tasting
from
a
sam
adams
sales
rep
at
bermans
in
lexinton
so
the
look
of
the
beer
had
a
nice
maduro
cigar
look
to
it
so
the
noise
on
this
beer
was
not
impressive
at
all
hints
of
cedar
and
earthy
tones
but
no
chocolate
at
all
so
here
came
the
most
important
part
taste
wow
pretty
gross
pretty
much
it
tasted
like
melted
tootsie
rolls
and
that
thick
cough
syrup
taste
and
the
worst
part
it
costs
15
no
that
is
a
crime
i
would
maybe
pay
3bucks
at
the
most
for
this
bar
do
not
recommend
the
beer
is
crisp
maybe
overly
carbonated
it
not
only
tastes
like
root
beer
it
drinks
like
a
soda
as
well
so
drinkability
is
high
but
not
really
for
a
good
reason
very
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
d
the
reviews
on
this
one
have
been
all
over
the
place
i
was
excited
to
receive
it
as
a
gift
then
nervous
once
i
read
some
of
the
reviews
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
sweet
and
bitter
balance
on
the
palate
the
nose
left
a
little
to
be
desired
but
i
feel
the
taste
more
than
made
up
for
it
all
set
to
berate
myself
for
blowing
my
wad
on
this
i
was
instead
more
upset
that
i
had
so
little
of
it
and
that
it
was
priced
out
of
my
interestinrepurchasing
range
but
for
those
of
you
with
more
dough
or
those
with
an
appreciation
for
mellow
middle
of
the
road
strength
beers
i
cant
recommend
this
enough
yummy
this
beer
costs
about
14
99
a
bottle
locally
to
be
honest
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
it
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
the
price
its
really
not
worth
it
based
on
the
price
the
bottle
and
the
marketing
im
going
to
say
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
drunk
by
people
being
pretentious
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
it
was
lacking
in
its
simplicity
overall
a
decent
beer
that
just
seems
to
simple
given
the
steep
price
i
probably
would
not
try
this
again
unless
someone
gave
it
to
me
a
tasty
if
overpriced
brew
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
i
find
that
i
keep
expecting
more
of
a
stout
character
and
in
that
aspect
this
beer
is
underwhelming
however
there
are
no
off
flavors
here
as
a
bock
beer
this
seems
to
be
a
solid
offering
overall
its
easy
to
drink
in
a
strange
way
even
though
it
barely
taste
like
beer
the
price
to
is
a
bit
much
with
more
obviously
going
to
the
slick
packaging
than
to
the
ingredients
is
it
worth
trying
absolutely
on
draught
if
possible
i
dont
remember
what
i
paid
for
this
beer
but
i
do
know
that
it
was
not
cheap
the
beer
is
a
good
beer
but
it
is
certainly
overpriced
just
judging
off
the
price
you
would
expect
much
more
then
you
are
getting
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
and
entirely
enjoyable
mouthfeel
even
for
a
bock
is
thin
the
carbonation
is
i
suppose
appropriate
but
boy
its
a
thin
beer
on
the
flat
side
d
light
alcohol
goes
great
with
a
piece
of
raw
chocolate
cake
made
with
raw
cacao
beans
which
is
what
i
am
pairing
it
with
but
way
overpriced
d
a
tasty
beverage
but
cmon
this
is
not
worth
14
it
is
good
and
easily
drinkable
but
so
are
most
beers
at
5
5
abv
bottle
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
sizeable
head
that
stays
around
little
lacing
malt
and
chocolate
aroma
chocolate
in
the
mouth
too
i
was
not
too
enthused
with
this
at
all
pretty
boring
i
was
expecting
more
from
sam
adams
who
likes
to
try
some
interesting
things
from
time
to
time
rather
disappointing
as
the
gorgeous
bottle
promised
so
much
more
as
did
the
hefty
sixteendollar
price
tag
d
ill
start
off
by
saying
this
beer
impressed
me
more
than
i
thought
though
i
still
feel
its
overpriced
it
deserves
some
recognition
it
is
fairly
straight
forward
but
is
exceptional
at
its
singular
focus
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
milk
stout
in
its
sweet
character
and
lack
of
hops
this
would
make
a
great
desert
beer
and
is
very
nice
to
end
a
long
day
with
d
no
thanks
ill
pass
on
this
one
thought
it
wouldve
been
much
better
i
had
this
one
hand
for
the
new
year
cracked
it
opened
it
pours
quite
easily
with
little
carbination
after
pouring
the
head
almost
completely
disappears
leaving
a
trace
of
whispy
lacing
floating
on
top
to
sum
the
flavor
its
definitely
smooth
and
slightly
complex
with
no
chaulky
taste
make
this
one
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
good
once
in
a
great
while
beer
which
is
just
what
it
is
meant
to
be
since
the
bbc
classifies
this
is
an
extreme
beer
kudos
to
them
as
this
beer
isnt
too
intimidating
but
at
the
same
time
the
aging
over
the
swiss
chocolate
produces
some
very
complex
flavors
that
create
a
quite
interesting
blend
in
this
bock
almost
like
taking
a
sip
of
a
good
bock
and
then
a
nice
bite
of
chocolate
an
excellent
beer
to
pair
with
a
chocolate
dessert
especially
one
as
good
as
my
wife
makes
i
look
forward
to
drinking
the
2008
version
of
this
beer
bottom
line
did
i
enjoy
this
beer
yes
is
it
worth
the
14
i
paid
for
it
probably
not
its
worth
a
try
but
i
say
split
a
bottle
with
some
friends
this
is
a
delicious
desert
beer
really
intense
chocolate
flavors
make
this
one
hell
of
a
night
cap
pretty
straight
forward
not
very
complex
still
quite
drinkable
and
recommended
to
at
least
try
once
this
was
a
good
beer
but
just
not
as
exciting
as
i
had
hoped
thisll
play
nicely
but
again
its
easier
to
pay
6
on
draft
than
16
in
a
bottle
the
beer
is
good
i
dont
think
it
qualifies
for
greatness
the
beer
seems
simple
unlike
a
good
german
bock
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
with
a
slight
warming
of
the
mouth
the
finish
is
there
but
it
isnt
bitter
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
sam
adams
since
this
is
suppose
to
be
an
unique
beer
and
different
i
didnt
think
so
however
it
could
be
a
great
easy
drinking
wintertime
beer
if
i
didnt
pay
16
dollars
for
the
bottle
the
price
definitely
lowers
the
drinkability
d
price
must
rank
in
here
this
is
a
pedestrian
beer
going
for
world
class
beer
money
i
dont
know
if
my
taste
have
just
progressed
that
much
but
i
remember
this
being
better
the
beer
geeks
must
have
this
and
i
think
that
is
what
sam
was
counting
on
i
would
have
to
say
pass
on
this
one
and
get
something
else
i
have
a
feeling
these
bottles
are
going
to
be
on
the
shelves
for
years
opened
on
xmas
eve
poured
somewhat
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
little
lacing
is
left
when
drinking
aroma
is
cocoa
a
little
sweet
aroma
too
nothing
much
there
taste
is
lite
a
hint
of
cocoa
is
present
not
real
malty
either
this
beer
isnt
heavy
at
all
so
drinking
a
few
of
these
with
your
buddies
will
be
no
problem
disappointed
somewhat
being
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
sa
i
paid
13
49
for
a
bottle
and
for
that
i
expected
a
stronger
beer
with
a
higher
abv
d
i
was
surprised
how
drinkable
this
beer
is
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
dessert
beer
to
me
it
really
is
easy
to
quaff
and
the
moderate
strength
allows
for
multiple
servings
i
could
certainly
enjoy
more
than
a
glass
i
consider
this
a
pretty
decent
bock
w
the
bonus
of
the
swiss
cocoa
pours
black
with
some
ruby
highlighs
and
a
light
head
that
quickly
fades
smells
light
and
tangy
with
a
nice
chocolate
aroma
mostly
cocoa
there
are
also
some
malty
bock
notes
on
the
finish
very
gentle
in
the
mouth
with
nice
flavors
from
the
chocolate
and
the
lager
yeast
very
mellow
with
a
milk
chocolate
creaminess
and
flavor
extremely
smooth
and
quite
nice
but
not
the
most
exciting
beer
in
the
world
id
like
to
see
some
more
bitterness
in
the
chocolate
here
still
very
mellow
and
drinkable
with
some
satisfying
this
is
not
a
good
sam
adams
beer
good
but
not
16
good
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
nice
thick
fluffy
brown
head
that
hung
around
a
while
aroma
was
choclatey
with
some
roasted
malts
and
a
little
fruit
flavor
was
pretty
much
the
same
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
i
expected
but
i
have
to
remember
this
is
a
bock
and
not
a
stout
drinkability
was
very
high
on
this
as
the
flavor
combined
with
the
5
6abv
made
this
an
easy
drinker
d
an
excellent
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
while
the
beer
itself
was
fairly
sweet
it
turned
out
to
be
very
good
i
was
concerned
about
it
possibly
maintaining
style
but
the
maltiness
made
itself
more
evident
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
a
good
drinking
beer
overall
overall
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
worth
the
14
75
i
paid
for
it
either
the
beer
was
an
average
beer
at
an
above
average
price
d
easy
to
drink
but
pita
in
the
wallet
if
it
wasnt
so
much
a
bottle
id
really
enjoy
drinking
this
taste
is
simple
and
abv
is
easy
too
d
very
good
drinkability
due
to
its
lightness
a
tasty
beer
to
drink
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
at
15
but
it
was
fun
to
try
if
the
bottle
was
in
the
56
range
im
sure
id
go
for
it
again
hv
this
poured
a
dark
ruby
color
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
roasted
barley
and
bitter
chocolate
malt
with
copper
hops
an
sweet
yeast
with
a
hint
of
honey
it
tasted
like
semisweet
chocolate
with
roasted
barley
copper
hops
and
some
floury
yeast
as
it
warmed
the
flavor
opened
up
with
more
pronounced
sweetness
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
bittersweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
simple
but
nicely
constructed
beer
it
had
a
nice
flavor
that
was
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
the
body
was
fitting
for
the
style
too
i
found
myself
wishing
it
was
heavier
as
an
imperial
stout
but
thats
just
my
personal
preference
all
in
all
definitely
overpriced
but
fun
to
try
once
i
will
start
this
out
by
saying
after
reading
the
other
postings
about
this
i
believe
i
got
a
flat
beer
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
look
is
black
equivalent
to
cola
a
off
white
heading
with
brown
swirls
settled
very
quickly
and
looked
very
flat
immediatley
smelled
cocoa
kind
of
overpowering
the
taste
isnt
that
much
different
then
that
of
the
smell
a
very
flat
cocoa
taste
a
coffee
lovers
dream
no
lacing
whatsoever
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
as
i
said
before
i
believe
i
got
a
very
flat
beer
goes
down
exceptionally
easy
not
too
sweet
not
to
bitter
you
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
beer
because
it
is
more
like
a
light
chocolate
shake
than
a
bock
i
happen
to
be
enjoying
this
on
christmas
day
and
it
is
perfect
for
the
occasion
tried
this
one
with
a
friend
who
is
relatively
new
to
micros
and
this
was
definitely
to
his
liking
by
that
respect
it
seems
like
a
great
transition
beer
different
enough
to
open
your
eyes
to
the
world
of
better
beer
without
being
overwhelming
but
i
can
see
how
veteran
bas
may
be
turned
off
by
sams
attempt
at
a
beer
that
is
more
over
the
top
than
their
traditional
offerings
now
imo
being
that
this
is
a
limited
release
it
is
worth
a
try
at
least
once
if
you
can
find
it
but
at
that
price
i
would
expect
it
to
be
a
little
better
than
it
was
luckily
i
had
some
friends
to
go
in
with
me
on
this
one
or
i
doubt
i
would
have
picked
it
up
the
chocolate
is
indeed
there
you
can
smell
it
and
taste
it
i
think
if
this
were
a
robust
porter
or
something
like
that
it
might
have
been
delicious
but
bocks
are
already
so
malty
and
sweet
it
tasted
very
odd
needed
some
roast
backbone
to
stand
up
to
the
chocolate
flavors
and
for
a
bomber
like
this
especially
a
bock
youd
really
be
expecting
a
more
robust
higher
abv
beer
why
not
chocolate
doppelbock
d
i
know
this
beer
is
very
pricey
but
the
taste
was
great
but
for
a
bock
it
felt
a
little
light
on
the
tongue
and
the
price
does
hurt
the
drinkablilty
but
i
think
this
beer
is
still
worth
a
try
mfd
not
bad
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
pretty
drinkable
i
wish
this
one
was
a
little
thicker
and
a
lot
less
expensive
my
uncle
said
he
loved
it
until
i
told
him
how
much
the
bottle
cost
then
he
said
nevermind
poured
a
dark
near
opaque
black
color
with
a
fizzy
yet
fine
tan
head
nice
mellow
chocolate
aromas
with
a
mild
malt
showing
chocolate
definitely
dominated
the
palate
here
and
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
there
was
not
much
of
that
classic
malty
bock
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
thin
and
fizzy
not
was
i
was
expecting
but
still
a
decent
brew
but
at
almost
11
bucks
a
bottle
not
something
i
will
probably
try
again
unless
i
see
it
on
tap
still
worth
a
try
if
you
havnt
had
it
yet
d
the
flavors
did
not
go
together
well
really
hurting
the
drinkability
of
this
one
i
found
this
on
tap
the
flavor
is
much
more
intense
at
6
a
class
i
would
recommend
over
the
bottle
drinkability
the
abv
says
this
should
be
fairly
sessionable
and
i
find
it
is
easy
to
drink
with
the
caveat
that
this
is
a
big
ole
750ml
bottle
id
like
to
see
it
come
out
in
a
smaller
bottle
but
hey
thats
just
me
a
pretty
nice
drop
here
overall
d
got
it
as
a
gift
but
the
price
on
this
is
a
bit
tough
i
sure
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
out
the
shining
points
are
the
quality
pure
flavors
not
fake
which
do
make
it
worth
a
couple
extra
bucks
original
review
was
from
one
of
the
big
fancy
bombers
ive
since
had
the
12oz
bottles
that
come
in
the
winter
packs
and
i
find
this
beer
kind
of
nasty
like
chalky
cocoa
mix
in
a
soso
beer
i
dont
know
whats
changed
here
it
might
be
me
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
rather
high
since
its
a
small
beer
and
good
tasting
i
definitely
enjoy
it
but
would
never
spend
the
amount
they
want
for
a
bottle
now
that
ive
tasted
it
worth
a
try
once
but
not
exceptional
worth
seeking
out
though
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
seasonal
beers
definitely
worth
trying
d
i
would
not
purchase
this
beer
again
i
was
not
inspired
to
finish
the
one
glass
i
had
pretty
tasty
overall
but
i
feel
like
there
should
be
a
price
component
of
reviews
because
this
is
pretty
tasty
but
its
not
20
a
bottle
quality
so
while
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
took
a
bit
off
due
to
the
high
price
which
at
the
end
of
the
day
impacts
drinkability
for
me
in
a
way
d
a
good
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
by
a
long
shot
id
buy
this
again
if
it
were
cheaper
great
flavors
going
on
here
and
with
a
low
abv
its
an
easy
drinker
my
best
description
of
this
brew
would
be
michs
amber
bock
mixed
with
youngs
double
chocolate
about
7030
good
beer
but
for
15
it
is
way
overpriced
drinkability
well
ill
finish
this
bottle
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
i
like
a
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
this
isnt
750
ml
bottle
best
before
april
2009
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
frothy
tan
head
head
retention
is
good
but
not
much
lacing
it
smells
like
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
some
vanilla
and
earthy
hops
i
dont
notice
any
hops
in
the
taste
however
i
can
taste
chocolate
chalky
cocoa
powder
caramel
and
some
vanilla
theres
also
a
coffee
taste
in
the
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
thin
but
creamy
and
has
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
but
it
certainly
isnt
worth
the
price
very
drinkable
aroma
is
fairly
strong
richly
of
molasses
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
salt
more
like
the
tang
of
a
sea
breeze
color
is
a
rich
opaque
chocolaty
brown
appetizing
and
inviting
malty
flavor
has
a
strong
chocolate
undertone
sweet
hints
and
just
a
touch
of
a
salty
tang
it
leaves
a
molasseslike
sweetness
on
the
lips
and
tingles
on
the
way
down
overall
not
bad
but
not
that
good
either
it
just
has
this
strong
cheap
cocoapowder
taste
thats
not
entirely
pleasant
for
the
price
15
for
750ml
i
cant
recommend
this
at
all
summary
i
saw
that
the
reviews
for
this
beer
werent
great
but
i
decided
to
pick
one
up
for
the
fun
bottle
and
to
have
after
my
ommegang
chocolate
indulgence
the
headtohead
is
that
the
ommegang
is
better
as
well
as
being
cheaper
i
know
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
and
honestly
i
think
if
someone
offered
me
some
i
would
prefer
something
else
this
was
the
second
round
of
tasting
this
beer
the
last
was
the
last
release
4
or
5
years
ago
i
cant
quite
remember
exactly
anyway
on
to
the
beer
i
was
very
excited
when
this
bock
arrived
at
the
local
beer
store
needless
to
say
i
was
not
disappointed
with
this
years
limited
release
the
aroma
is
like
that
of
dark
roasted
malt
with
a
chocolate
aroma
but
there
is
a
slight
moccaish
coffee
aroma
which
catches
you
by
surprise
just
before
you
are
ready
to
drink
the
beer
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
there
is
a
light
and
not
overpowering
flavor
of
a
finer
chocolate
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
i
will
buy
some
more
taste
is
somewhat
watery
milk
chocolate
malt
a
bit
of
wheat
some
vanilla
some
roasted
nuts
ends
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
d
a
strong
coco
earthy
beer
something
ill
have
to
try
in
the
bottle
under
much
better
circumstances
i
was
very
excited
to
find
a
display
of
this
in
my
local
fresh
market
i
honestly
had
not
heard
of
this
beer
and
for
15
99
i
was
a
little
hesitant
to
try
but
i
figured
it
was
for
thanksgiving
and
might
be
a
treat
to
say
i
was
unimpressed
would
be
an
understatement
the
appearance
and
smell
was
slghtly
promising
but
beyond
that
nothing
very
light
mouthfeel
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
unless
i
was
given
a
bottle
i
will
not
try
this
again
i
liked
this
beer
but
not
for
15
99
if
someone
offered
me
some
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
however
ive
had
better
chocolate
beers
and
its
hard
for
me
to
justify
the
pricetag
on
this
one
a
nice
beer
but
for
16
i
paid
for
it
id
sooner
get
an
old
viscosity
or
two
and
pocket
the
change
pours
a
very
dark
reddish
color
small
offwhite
head
coffee
chocolate
aromas
not
a
strong
aroma
weak
milk
chocolate
taste
cocoa
aftertaste
very
tasty
sweet
like
a
milk
stout
probably
the
best
chocolate
beer
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
overall
coles
really
pricey
as
a
bottle
and
on
tap
and
not
worth
it
compared
to
many
good
and
better
chocolatepowered
beers
now
available
chocolate
liquor
thinned
down
but
still
above
average
mouthfeel
for
a
beer
a
nice
one
though
a
little
chocolately
and
simple
in
aroma
drop
of
vanilla
drinkability
great
after
dinner
beer
d
i
feel
this
would
get
as
intense
as
going
to
town
on
an
army
surplus
duffel
bag
full
of
reeses
cups
delicious
until
you
vomited
and
ended
up
with
diabetes
delicious
dessert
beer
thats
for
sure
good
beer
like
most
sa
beers
i
think
the
best
thing
this
beer
had
going
for
it
was
its
remarkably
balanced
if
not
simple
tastes
for
whatever
reason
i
cant
explain
why
it
isnt
as
drinkable
as
most
of
the
rest
of
their
beers
overall
it
just
didnt
meet
my
expectations
when
it
came
to
taste
the
15
price
was
also
waaaayyy
too
much
for
a
beer
like
this
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
definitely
disappointing
decent
drinkability
i
only
have
experience
with
one
other
chocolate
beer
to
compare
this
to
youngs
dbl
chocolate
i
prefer
the
chocolate
tastes
of
the
later
but
appreciated
the
way
in
which
sa
transformed
the
profile
of
the
chocolate
delivery
i
only
wish
it
was
a
little
less
subtle
because
i
feel
like
those
who
are
searching
for
a
chocolaty
beer
will
be
disappointed
with
this
also
the
bottle
was
15
at
a
package
store
in
the
brigham
circle
area
of
boston
daras
wine
and
spirits
i
had
to
try
several
stores
before
i
found
one
that
carried
the
beer
others
such
as
huntington
liquors
near
symphony
hall
said
they
were
sold
out
d
very
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
it
as
it
is
limited
release
not
a
beer
for
everyday
drinking
but
on
a
speacial
occasion
id
be
happy
to
break
this
beer
ou
with
fine
belgian
truffles
d
very
drinkable
brew
there
was
some
promise
but
it
never
completely
followed
through
and
i
did
end
up
feeling
that
it
wasnt
worth
the
money
mouthfeel
is
thin
yet
has
a
creamy
texture
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
overwhelming
me
drinks
easy
enough
a
very
nice
hybrid
bock
but
this
is
about
57
a
bottle
too
much
imo
i
like
bocks
chocolate
pours
with
no
head
and
little
carbonation
slightly
light
around
the
edges
not
entirely
opaque
nose
is
fairly
strong
lots
of
malt
and
candied
fruit
up
in
here
taste
is
all
about
a
weak
chocolate
flavor
with
a
sweet
syrupy
feel
it
is
thick
and
sweet
good
mouthfeel
keeps
me
drinking
it
but
nothing
i
would
ever
pay
14
99
for
what
its
retailing
here
for
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
for
the
price
drinkability
very
good
beer
and
i
love
it
but
not
quite
worth
the
14bottle
price
tag
i
would
love
to
have
it
again
though
only
on
a
special
occasion
this
is
a
fantastic
desert
beer
i
will
certainly
recommend
to
my
friends
that
if
possible
they
get
their
hands
on
one
im
just
glad
to
have
this
one
to
myself
interesting
pours
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
a
creamy
brown
head
aroma
is
chocolate
ice
cream
with
beer
in
the
background
taste
is
malty
up
front
but
there
is
nothing
subtle
about
the
chocolate
flavors
it
kind
of
tastes
like
nestle
quik
mixed
into
a
brown
ale
very
sweet
its
a
good
beer
but
not
for
15
a
bottle
the
cocoa
adds
another
dimension
to
what
is
otherwise
a
standard
bock
its
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
a
cold
night
and
while
the
price
may
be
high
a
fan
of
bocks
would
probably
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
try
this
its
hard
to
say
how
i
feel
about
chocolate
bock
i
was
really
excited
for
this
one
and
i
think
that
this
lead
to
my
initial
disappointment
with
it
however
after
trying
it
again
with
a
more
realistic
mindset
ive
realized
this
beer
is
actually
a
nice
drink
it
pours
rich
and
dark
with
a
big
head
the
smell
was
sweet
and
bitter
together
with
a
strong
cocoa
scent
and
some
maltiness
the
taste
is
where
it
was
a
letdown
the
first
time
its
fine
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
bang
its
really
exactly
what
its
advertised
as
a
chocolate
bock
it
tastes
like
a
bock
with
some
subtle
chocolately
flavor
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
not
too
thick
i
would
have
it
again
if
i
had
some
extra
cash
on
me
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
quality
brew
the
value
of
which
will
be
det
by
others
i
think
its
worth
a
try
but
probably
not
a
second
its
good
and
different
and
i
cant
ask
for
more
overall
this
was
not
at
all
what
i
expected
lighter
with
an
easy
sessionablity
to
it
i
would
have
no
issue
with
tring
this
one
again
though
at
15
bucks
a
little
much
poured
this
one
into
the
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
it
had
a
nice
strong
dark
color
that
i
like
in
a
bock
with
a
minimal
head
nothing
to
memorable
in
the
smell
department
just
another
basic
bock
as
for
taste
it
is
what
it
is
chocolate
bock
nothing
more
nothing
less
the
chocolate
is
much
more
subdued
then
in
other
brews
ive
had
made
with
chocolate
but
noticeable
if
you
like
bocks
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
its
no
where
near
worth
the
price
tag
honestly
a
disappointment
without
even
considering
the
pricetag
it
was
watered
down
and
had
no
balls
or
anything
to
it
after
considering
the
price
lets
just
say
extremely
disappointing
i
wouldnt
try
this
beer
again
there
are
a
lot
better
chocolate
bocks
and
stouts
out
there
d
it
goes
down
easy
enough
this
is
a
fine
dessert
beer
complex
and
very
tasty
i
just
wish
it
werent
so
pricey
nice
beer
very
good
mouthfeel
is
nioce
and
smooth
thick
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
but
nothing
real
exciting
to
me
d
pretty
good
but
not
nearly
worth
the
huge
price
tag
a
good
beer
but
is
it
worth
15
drinkability
this
ones
not
unbelievably
chocolatey
nor
is
it
worth
the
price
but
its
a
good
beer
nonetheless
glad
we
were
able
to
get
this
one
in
georgia
where
it
was
9
99
a
bottle
instead
of
virginia
15
99bottle
or
florida
17
99bottle
speaking
of
bottles
thats
one
of
the
primary
reasons
we
grabbed
this
one
just
a
very
cool
very
neat
bottle
on
this
one
but
back
to
drinkability
its
solid
very
low
in
alcohol
and
flavorful
enough
that
it
was
really
enjoyable
if
you
can
find
it
cheap
or
split
it
with
a
friend
do
so
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
decent
creamy
light
brown
head
that
retains
well
smells
of
slight
roastiness
semisweet
malts
hop
spice
perfect
amount
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
and
just
a
touch
in
the
aftertaste
noble
hops
in
the
finish
slightly
roasty
caramel
velvety
mouthfeel
slick
finish
perfect
carbonation
good
but
i
was
expecting
something
totally
different
and
better
when
i
had
it
4
years
ago
it
seemed
better
nice
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
decent
carbonation
level
mild
chocolatey
and
vanilla
aromas
malty
and
bready
smelling
very
malty
flavor
backed
with
a
mild
chocolate
taste
underlying
taste
of
vanilla
to
it
very
mild
oakiness
nice
balance
of
several
flavorsnone
of
which
is
overdone
nice
pleasant
silkiness
to
the
mouthfeel
all
around
a
very
balanced
beer
and
very
drinkable
ps
definetly
drank
too
cold
can
taste
the
chocolate
more
as
it
warms
still
not
the
chocolate
explosion
i
would
expect
from
a
proclaimed
chocolate
bock
though
the
flavor
was
heavy
with
caramel
and
had
only
a
little
less
chocolate
minimal
carbonation
it
had
a
very
smooth
and
equally
smooth
mouth
feel
and
was
equally
smooth
going
down
the
pipe
smooth
as
silk
no
bitterness
or
bit
in
the
aftertaste
not
what
im
use
to
with
stouts
this
is
a
great
quality
bock
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
it
i
just
wish
it
didnt
require
me
to
buy
a
bomber
for
15
i
would
definitely
buy
again
for
a
special
occasion

a
decent
beer
with
some
unique
features
but
thats
about
it
i
liked
it
less
as
it
progressed
and
drinkability
that
started
off
very
well
became
somewhat
limited
as
the
onedimensional
chocolate
aspect
became
a
bit
too
much
relatively
mild
alcohol
for
a
bock
honey
and
vanilla
there
are
some
metallic
notes
as
well
some
light
grassy
hops
towards
the
end
to
keep
the
brew
honest
i
dont
really
pick
up
much
bock
flavors
though
cvstricklandnov

which
also
helped
out
the
drinkability
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
get
this
regularly
though
bierfannov

but
its
nature
as
a
bock
takes
a
big
backseat
with
this
beer

on

i

i

it
would

been
a

gimmick
beer
that
doesnt
quite
hit
the
mark
but
gives
a
good
effort
nonetheless
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
carbonation
here
is
subtle
and
light
yet
the
weight
seems
just
perfect
any
heavier
it
becomes
dessert
rather
than
accompanying
it
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
after
dinner
and
its
relatively
low
abv
keeps
it
very
drinkable
with
or
without
food
highly
recommended
this
is
a
fine
product
good
taste
and
all
just
not
a
beer
for
me
mk
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
very
drinkable
given
the
right
atmosphere
and
food
nice
clean
taste
the
only
negative
was
the
price
which
was
too
high
and
probably
inflated
due
to
the
fancy
packaging
looks
nice
but
i
would
have
preferred
this
a
few
bucks
cheaper
drinkability
a
unique
beer
and
one
thats
very
easy
to
drink
why
i
could
i
drink
this
beer
with
my
face
tied
behind
my
shoes
try
this
definitely
cheers
i
bought
two
bottles
of
this
at
friar
tuck
since
they
had
them
marked
wrong
i
opened
it
up
to
share
with
with
and
im
glad
i
did
as
i
would
not
be
able
to
drink
the
entire
bottle
myself
appearance
was
great
as
every
sa
are
dark
and
velvety
looking
smell
was
inviting
but
the
taste
was
a
little
too
chocolatey
carbonation
was
right
on
but
would
not
buy
another
at
the
price
offered
at
first
the
cola
taste
seems
almost
overwhelming
but
it
fades
quickly
certainly
worthy
of
the
chocolate
aspect
of
the
name
but
not
quite
as
bocklike
as
i
expected
more
like
a
chocolate
dunkel
its
quite
drinkable
and
a
solid
beer
but
way
overpriced
very
unique
and
quality
product
i
confess
i
was
initially
turned
off
of
the
whole
idea
of
chocolate
bock
it
was
bitter

notes
seems
to
built
around
a
dark
chocolate
bitter
bar
and
nothing
else
mouthfeel
is
light
for
the
style
you
could
spend
your
money
on
a
random
six
pack
and
come
up
with
better
results
and
change
uggghhhh
not
for
me
or
for
you
overall
i
was
worried
how
this
would
do
being
a
year
old
id
decided
to
not
review
it
if
it
was
skunked
it
was
a
real
good
beer
even
after
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
a
year
if
you
are
into
sweet
beers
or
dark
chocolate
this
could
become
your
favorite
otherwise
its
still
a
very
nice
beer
to
have
on
occasion
a
very
good
looking
beer
when
poured
solid
black
with
a
nice
2in
tan
foamy
head
the
initial
smell
is
of
malt
nuts
and
a
nice
chocolate
aroma
when
i
first
started
to
drink
it
the
beer
was
a
little
too
cold
so
the
taste
wasnt
fully
there
couldnt
really
taste
the
chocolate
but
it
still
had
the
malt
flavor
once
the
beer
started
to
warm
up
the
chocolate
became
very
noticable
its
somewhat
sweet
so
i
would
limit
myself
to
just
one
bottle
more
than
that
might
make
my
stomach
feel
a
little
off
i
must
say
that
i
enjoyed
much
more
when
it
was
from
a
tap
but
it
still
was
an
enjoyable
beer
with
desert
on
christmas
body
is
just
below
medium
with
loose
carbonation
and
a
slick
oily
mouthfeel
pretty
darn
tastey
but
one
glass
was
enough
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
large
creamy
foamy
head
the
head
lasts
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
weak
i
could
detect
only
a
slight
aroma
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
a
very
strong
creamy
chocolatebut
its
not
as
sweet
as
i
expected
this
is
like
chocolate
milk
the
taste
is
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
this
is
more
like
a
porter
than
bock
the
mf
is
heavy
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
damn
good
beerand
i
plan
to
have
it
for
years
to
come
during
christmas
dessert
not
bad
but
awfully
sweet
and
lacking
in
depth
for
such
a
highpriced
special
offering
i
know
they
use
real
chocolate
in
this
but
it
comes
across
like
a
chocolate
flavoring
extract
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
but
not
a
huge
fan
either
nice
change
of
pace
in
the
winter
time
tried
again
last
night
havent
had
this
in
a
while
its

chocolate
milk

highlights
smells
smooothly
of
milk
chocolate
and
malt
backbone
mild
sourness
and
hop
aroma
balance
out
the
nose
tastes
silky
sweet
without
being
overly
malty
or
sugary
bittersweet
cocoa
is
balanced
with
milky
lactose
flavors
make
this
beer
slide
down
very
easily
round
and
robust
to
the
palate
heavy
and
mild
at
the
same
time
no
real
alcohol
to
heat
but
does
give
up
more
thin
sweetness
i
would
prefer
more
alcoholic
notes
in
a
bock
beer
but
it
goes
down
way
too
easy
on
the
dark
side
the
beer
seems
to
give
up
complexity
flavor
and
balance
as
it
sits
for
a
while
all
in
all
a
great
beer
uf
poured
a
deep
deep
ruby
red
which
can
easily
be
mistaken
for
black
and
two
fingers
of
dense
beige
head
aroma
is
wonderful
roasted
malts
blended
with
rich
milk
chocolate
taste
is
more
of
the
same
the
chocolate
never
becomes
too
sweet
though
as
this
must
be
balanced
with
a
good
deal
of
hops
if
you
love
chocolate
then
you
will
love
the
taste
of
this
one
the
mouthfeel
was
silky
smooth
and
the
body
was
medium
maybe
a
little
on
the
thin
side
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
with
the
15
price
tag
i
wont
be
having
another
any
time
soon
very
dark
great
smelling
beer
great
to
sit
back
relax
watch
a
movie
and
just
smell
taking
a
few
sips
now
and
then
rich
taste
lots
of
chocolate
dont
gripe
about
the
price
this
one
is
worth
the
1214
youre
gonna
pay
as
its
not
an
every
day
drinking
beer
im
keeping
one
of
these
on
hand
for
those
visitors
who
havent
tried
anything
but
the
standard
american
beers
definatly
a
convertor
try
drinking
with
some
guinness
marbled
swiss
cheese
a
perfect
match
drinkability
very
well
constructed
and
one
of
the
best
chocolate
flavored
beers
ive
tried
this
would
be
an
ideal
pairing
with
a
chocolate
dessert
and
is
a
nice
special
occasion
beer
standing
alone
not
at
all
difficult
to
finish
the
big
bottle
just
for
the
heck
of
it
but
its
a
tad
overpriced
in
my
opinion
drinkability
it
sure
is
good
but
for
the
price
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
exotic
i
guess
well
it
sure
is
chocolatey
it
smells
like
chocolate
tastes
like
chocolate
and
is
pretty
close
to
the
color
of
chocolate
well
a
bit
more
red
thats
about
it
yea
go
14
beer
that
tastes
like
a
mug
of
hot
cocoa
to
be
fair
it
is
quite
tastey
there
is
a
touch
of
fruitiness
hidden
away
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
weak
why
is
this
beer
so
expensive
prosit
important
note
the
bottle
says
to
enjoy
vefore
march
2005
and
i
am
drinking
it
in
early
april
this
may
not
be
fair
to
judge
too
much
for
a
stale
beer
they
made
sure
to
place
this
label
small
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
my
pour
got
me
two
thick
fingers
worth
of
mochabrown
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
minimal
light
penetration
and
ruby
highlights
nose
was
more
milk
chocolaty
than
i
might
have
expected
given
the
verbiage
on
the
neck
label
mouthfeel
was
big
thick
even
chewy
whoa
lots
of
rich
chocolate
flavor
in
the
mouth
like
liquid
dessert
think
chocolate
cake
or
brownies
man
i
think
that
i
prefer
my
chocolate
beers
to
have
a
dark
chocolate
taste
as
opposed
to
a
milk
or
sweet
chocolate
taste
this
may
have
been
inherited
from
my
parents
since
my
late
pops
only
really
liked
hersheys
special
dark
and
my
mom
was
not
into
chocolate
at
all
showing
a
preference
for
licorice
pastel
peanuts
gummy
candy
et
al
leave
the
sweet
stuff
to
hose
who
can
appreciate
it
i
say
finish
left
me
thinking
that
i
should
have
shared
that
12ounce
bottle
with
somebody
anybody
want
to
trade
for
the
other
pretty
unremarkable
really
the
one
redeeming
virtue
of
this
beer
is
its
uniquely
sweet
and
smooth
chocolate
flavor
at
about
14
for
a
24
ouncer
it
was
definitely
not
worth
the
money
also
this
beer
really
didnt
have
too
much
in
common
with
your
average
bock
if
fact
i
might
have
mistook
it
for
a
weirdtasting
porter
if
i
hadnt
of
poured
it
from
the
bottle
myself
still
if
you
can
get
it
cheap
its
decent
pretty
good
beer
a
fun
experiment
even
better
at
4
50pint
on
tap
hell
thats
cheaper
than
a
bottle
by
a
large
margin
good
for
a
pint
but
too
much
would
send
me
to
wonkaland
its
okay
for
an
after
dinner
drink
but
i
think
there
is
better
out
there
for
your
tastebuds
and
your
wallets
interesting
its
definitely
different
but
is
the
difference
good
pours
a
deep
brown
under
a
fluffy
but
transient
tan
head
with
dark
flecks
smell
is
rather
subdued
slightly
bitter
for
a
bock
with
droeste
cocoa
highlights
taste
is
fine
perhaps
a
little
too
much
coffee
roast
probably
should
have
been
a
little
less
bitter
to
work
better
with
the
chocolate
i
think
price
is
an
important
consideration
here
my
bottle
was
16
for
just
under
24oz
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
spectacular
one
taste
someone
elses
and
purchase
something
equally
creative
at
half
the
price
even
though
this
said
it
was
a
chocolate
bock
i
was
still
expecting
a
stout
or
porter
flavor
the
aroma
had
a
nice
amount
of
chocolate
and
fruity
bock
aroma
i
found
it
for
10
a
bottle
which
seems
about
what
its
worth
while
im
not
a
big
chocolate
fan
the
chocolate
in
the
beer
was
done
nicely
its
nice
and
complex
without
being
too
sweet
overall
id
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
if
you
get
the
chance
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
chocolate
rides
the
tongue
long
medium
heavy
in
body
extremely
drinkable
dessert
brew
worth
seeking
out
best
before
march
2005
brew
im
drinking
it
in
february
2005
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
ruby
with
a
dense
khaki
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
cocoa
and
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
theres
a
sticky
sweetness
in
the
flavor
but
it
refrains
from
becoming
cloying
the
body
is
slightly
sticky
its
rich
and
dessert
like
but
seems
to
be
a
little
lacking
in
complexity
a
very
fine
beer
this
chocolate
bock
pours
a
nice
dark
color
a
good
size
head
forms
and
lasts
the
smell
is
pleasing
sweat
malt
and
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
nice
nutty
and
slightly
chocolate
smooth

certainly
a

be

that

the
flailing
malt
had
a
bottle
a
year
ago
when
first
released
and
was
not
impressed
yet
this
draught
offering
surprised
me

more
compelling
than
its
progenitor
served
on
tap
at
the
snakebite
bar
by
accident
sam
adams
sent
them
the
wrong
kegs
lucky
me
pours
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
about
a
quarter
inch
thick
aromas
are
deeply
of
chocolate
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
roastiness
initial
flavors
are
quite
chocolatey
with
tones
of
toffee
and
coffee
and
a
bit
sweetness
in
the
mix
overall
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
almost
like
a
giant
milkshake
in
the
middle
there
are
hints
of
caramels
roastiness
and
molasses
but
there
is
absolutely
no
astringency
present
from
the
malts
which
makes
this
brew
quite
smooth
the
finish
and
is
as
sweet
and
chocolately
as
the
beginning
and
truly
reminds
me
of
an
alcoholic
chocolate
milkshake
as
for
drinkablility
i
feel
like
i
could
have
20
of
these
and
just
not
notice
because
there
is
no
astringency
and
a
lot
of
cocoa
and
chocolate
like
flavors
a
nice
offering
on
draft

super
drinkable
but
definately
something
that
isnt
a
daily
drinkerespecially
for
the
price
happy
new
year
seek
this
one
out
and
forgive
sam
adams
for
making
a
light
beer
one
firmly
in
the
no
thanks
column
for
me
drinkability
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
because
of
the
low
alcohol
content
this
is
a
winner
in
my
book
the
bottle
price
tag
is
outrageous
though
14
for
a
500ml
joke
its
not
that
good
this
stuff
aint
cantillon
or
dues
but
on
tap
for
3
50
for
12
ounces
you
got
yourself
a
deal
every
time
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
certainly
prefers
other
in
the
same
style
more
so
than
this
offering
from
sa
on
draught
at
winking
lizard
more
reasonably
priced
than
the
bottled
version
dark
brown
color
with
a
medium
thin
and
foamy
beige
head
thin
and
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
mainly
chocolate
and
cocoa
with
a
hint
of
malt
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
a
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
light
hops
balance
the
sweetness
pretty
well
the
finish
is
mildly
sweet
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
coffee
enjoyable
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
faded
quickly
and
left
a
nice
pillow
of
foam
on
the
top
till
the
last
drop
the
smell
was
very
good
especially
as
the
beer
warmed
with
a
wonderful
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
scent
the
flavor
was
good
too
with
a
healthy
dose
of
sweet
chocolate
at
first
then
the
malt
kicked
in
followed
by
a
slight
hoppiness
and
a
dry
dark
chocolate
finnish
and
aftertaste
the
beer
is
kind
of
one
dimentonal
but
what
do
you
expect
from
a
beer
claiming
to
have
a
large
chocolate
flavor
i
dig
it
but
i
would
never
buy
it
again
at
its
current
price
point
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
color
with
nice
ruby
hues
when
held
to
the
light
there
was
also
a
nice
ring
of
head
over
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
was
chocolate
caramel
and
a
slight
raisin
note
as
well
the
flavor
was
full
on
chocolate
with
some
creamy
marshmellow
tones
something
like
a
hot
chocolate
in
beer
form
the
feel
was
nicely
moderate
and
smooth
with
an
almost
velvety
feel
drinkability
was
big
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
went
down
with
no
problems
at
all
as
a
chocolate
lover
i
was
immediately
drawn
to
this
beer
on
the
shelves
at
a
vendor
in
hunt
valley
md
even
though
the
price
of
15
threw
me
back
a
bit
the
bottle
was
armed
with
a
great
pewterlike
badge
stating
samuel
adams
chocolate
bock
the
beer
was
consumed
at
room
temperature
the
presentation
is
a
dark
amber
with
largerthanaverage
white
head
while
the
nose
is
sweet
chocolate
and
raisins
the
chocolate
flavor
dominates
with
light
roasted
malt
which
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
but
it
isnt
as
present
as
id
desire
nonetheless
it
causes
me
to
seek
the
flavor
again
and
again
after
every
sip
i
find
myself
chasing
the
flavor
and
feel
somewhat
underwhelmed
by
the
sturdiness
of
the
body
this
beer
is
certainly
worthy
of
praise
but
the
price
smacks
me
into
regression
if
youre
looking
for
a
specialoccasion
beer
and
are
willing
to
spend
upwards
of
15
for
the
bottle
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
it
will
go

the

not

so
the

of

in

a

only
problems
are
the
finish
is
abrupt
and
weak
the
rest
of
the
sam
adams
line
up
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
that
the
chocolate
does
not
bowl
over
the
drinker
if
any
hints
of
chocolate
if
anything
kind
of
reminded
me
of
that
for

this
is
a
good
choice
if
you
want
a
sweet
treat

it
was
not
overwhelming
the
flavor
was
mildly
sweet

in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was

to

major

some

its
sweet
but
not
overbearing
id
love
to
sample
some
again
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
perhaps
even
looking
to
find
fault
with
this
but
i
cant
find
a
whole
lot
maybe
its
a
bit
thin
and
its
a
bit
onedimensional
the
chocolate
is
exceptionally
potent
here
but
thats
what
this
beer
is
aiming
for
except
it
is
a
bit
to
spendy
gotta
try
it
once
though
beerbuilderjan
13
but
it
took
me
a
while
to
finish
the
bottle
adrjan
13
the
aftertaste
has
a
nice
chocolate
flavor
and
is
quite
dry
while
it
is
a
drinkable
brew
tis
true
you
will
love
this
milk
chocolate
dominates
the
taste
not
sickly
sweet
o
im
not
really
sure
about
this
one
but
it
does
not
strike
me
as
being
bad
in
any
way
i
suppose
this
is
kind
of
a
mediocre
offering
overall
it
sort
of
tastes
like
cherry
coke
but
worse
not
interested
in
having
this
again

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
though
with
the
strong
flavors
of
cherry
dark
chocolate
and
caramel
it
is
much
more
suited
to
be
a
desert
beer
andor
paired
with
desert
as
opposed
to
a
sit
down
and
have
a
beersession
beer
i
do
like
the
strong
flavors
of
cherry
and
chocolate
v
low
as
far
as
i
know
is
only
available
in
the
winter
seasonal
sampler
pack
hated
it
couldnt
give
it
away
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
beers
ive
tasted
o
the
smell
is
glorious
too
bad
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
not
up
to
par
taste
starts
with
strong
cherry
with
chocolate
background
then
chocolate
dominates
the
middle
and
finishing
with
a
long
odd
chocolate
cherry
roasty
finish
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
like
the
sammy
chocolate
bock
made
with
scharffen
berger
chocolate
in
750
ml
bottles
this
reminds
us
of
cheap
cherrychocolate
candy
by
russel
stover
12
ounce
bottle
enjoy
before
march
2014
its
a
bit
dated
so
well
see
how
it
is
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
red
tints
theres
also
an
inch
light
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
mostly
smells
like
cherries
along
with
some
chocolate
cola
and
plums
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
molasses
and
a
slight
medicinal
flavor
also
the
chocolate
is
more
noticeable
in
the
flavor
of
this
brew
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
syrupy
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
i
thought
it
was
a
good
enough
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youve
never
had
it
before
beautiful
in
a
glass
deep
rich
color
the
cherry
taste
seems
powerful
at
first
and
then
the
chocolate
takes
over
this
may
be
a
bit
too
much
as
a
dinner
beer
but
better
as
a
dessert
beer
or
just
as
dessert
rich
and
full
bodied
good
with
red
meats
particularly
grilled
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
had
a
hard
time
drinking
it
it
tasted
like
a
flat
cherry
coke
with
cough
syrup
cherry
flavor
was
too
strong
this
beer
looks
like
any
good
stout
when
poured
into
a
glass
with
an
almost
entirely
opaque
brownblack
color
and
a
modest
tan
head
even
with
the
word
cherry
in
the
name
the
aroma
is
surprising
and
intriguing
with
how
much
it
reminds
me
of
a
freshly
opened
jar
of
maraschino
cherries
the
gimmicky
cherry
addition
doesnt
work
with
the
flavor
profile
though
with
the
sweetsour
of
the
cherries
conflicting
with
the
roasted
malts
and
bitter
cocoa
the
texture
is
surprisingly
light
but
the
sugary
sweetness
still
makes
it
a
bit
syrupy
overall
the
addition
of
cherries
to
this
recipe
is
strangely
alluring
but
the
gimmick
wears
off
quickly
overall
sam
adams
missed
the
mark
with
this
one
i
really
liked
the
chocolate
bock
last
year
but
adding
the
cherry
just
messed
it
up
too
sweet
and
artificial
tasting
overall
i
was
a
few
sips
in
and
really
didnt
even
want
to
finish
it
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
pours
black
with
a
one
finger
slightly
off
white
head
smells
of
cherry
syrup
much
like
cough
syrup
tastes
of
some
dark
roasted
malt
and
coffee
but
with
a
syrupy
cherry
aftertaste
quite
artificial
beer
is
light
bodied
good
carbonation
overall
an
ok
beer
overallcomments
ccb
is
a
solid
offering
that
i
would
classify
as
a
dessert
beer
because
of
the
extremely
sweet
nature
of
this
beer
in
my
opinion
if
this
beer
have
had
more
of
a
sour
cherry
flavor
it
would
have
been
a
very
good
offering
however
it
is
overly
sweet
for
me
as
is
consumed

abv
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
chocolate
cherry
lover
but
a
little
too
much
cherry
and
sweetness
for
me
o
not
the
worst
beer
but
definitely
synthetic
and
sugary
tastes
as
described
and
pretty
much
as
expected
but
i
did
not
enjoy
this
one
ophenomenal
beer
i
was
so
blown
away
by
the
flavor
of
this
beer
if
you
dont
like
chocolate
cake
with
cherries
in
it
dont
bother
but
if
that
sounds
good
to
you
or
youre
familiar
with
the
black
forest
cherry
torte
search
that
recipe
and
you
wont
regret
it
and
are
a
fan
you
definitely
need
to
check
this
out
i
sat
in
a
chair
just
beside
myself
wondering
where
i
had
been
and
how
i
could
get
an
unlimited
supply
of
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
like
candy
not
really
mr
koch
wont
you
send
me
a
barrel
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
and
very
refreshing
the
fruit
is
nicely
subdued
this
overall
is
a
great
special
holiday
beer
i
hope
we
see
it
again
next
year
much
better
than
their
other
fruit
beers
o
drain
pour
its
really
bad
sams
is
usually
good
but
i
often
hate
their
synthetic
flavored
fruit
beers
stay
away
unless
you
enjoyed
cranberry
lambic
tastes
exactly
like
a
tootsie
pop
you
will
never
be
able
to
drink
this
beer
again
without
thinking
about
the
previous
sentence
regardless
interesting
and
complex
flavor
i
think
its
a
polarizing
beer
which
makes
it
a
bold
move
by
sam
adams
theres
no
middle
ground
either
you
like
it
or
you
hate
it
i
thankfully
enjoyed
it
definitely
something
i
would
only
drink
in
the
winter
though
i
guess
this
is
a
polarizing
beer
some
people
love
it
i
downright
hated
it
i
took
several
sips
from
it
and
couldnt
get
past
that
it
came
with
the
winter
seasonal
mixed
pack
and
to
be
honest
i
was
skeptical
to
begin
with
because
i
dont
really
like
cherries
and
this
one
is
loaded
with
that
sour
cherry
taste
if
you
like
chocolate
covered
cherries
that
are
sour
then
you
might
like
this
its
was
the
worst
of
both
worlds
to
me
it
was
a
bad
dark
beer
mixed
with
a
bad
cherry
lambic
or
something
like
that
i
just
felt
this
was
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
but
to
each
hisher
own
someone
may
love
that
about
it
i
am
not
enamored
by
this
one
i
do
like
most
of
this
breweries
beers
that
i
have
tried
they
are
not
overly
wonderful
but
this
one
was
just
nasty
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
i
had
it
for
dessert
one
night
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
a
nice
beer
to
have
when
you
want
something
sweet
i
wouldnt
really
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
had
this
beer
for
the
first
time
over
the
weekend
at
a
friends
vacation
house
im
one
to
try
new
things
and
im
definitely
glad
i
tried
this
it
literally
did
taste
like
chocolate
cherry
cake
it
was
amazing
it
had
a
great
smell
the
packaging
was
bright
and
eyecatching
the
taste
was
amazing
the
cherry
was
definitely
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
i
dont
like
cherry
much
to
begin
with
and
the
chocolate
was
certainly
present
as
well
but
not
overly
sweet
would
definitely
drink
this
again
serving
type
ommegang
game
of
thrones
chalice
feel
medium
body
with
mediumlight
carbonation
split
a
bottle
of
this
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
dark
brown
color
almost
black
aroma
was
cherry
and
chocolate
flavor
was
very
much
like
a
cherry
cola
uncanny
really
i
liked
the
flavor
of
this
but
not
sure
if
i
would
want
a
whole
bottle
let
alone
a
six
pack
i
love
this
its
a
bit
like
a
cherry
cola
not
only
in
looks
however
it
really
is
delicious
its
simple
enough
both
smell
and
taste
are
chocolate
and
cherry
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
a
threefinger
tan
head
graces
the
top
of
this
dark
ruby
brew
a
waft
of
maraschino
cherries
and
milk
chocolate
bursts
from
the
bottle
upon
opening
and
is
even
more
apparent
once
poured
my
initial
excitement
is
quickly
dampened
however
the
feel
of
the
beer
in
the
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
taste
cherry
syrup
and
chocolate
mousse
dominate
the
pallet
but
are
watered
down
much
like
the
disappointing
false
promises
of
light
pudding
or
diet
soda
the
brew
lacks
something
and
does
not
completely
immerse
me
in
an
illusion
of
cherry
chocolatey
goodness
i
will
grant
you
something
though
samuel
adams
there
is
cherry
and
there
is
chocolate
add
a
little
texture
a
fuller
body
and
call
me
back
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
fun
beer
to
drink
if
it
werent
quite
so
candylike
id
probably
drink
it
up
but
after
a
couple
of
these
things
it
gets
a
bit
overwhelming
i
really
like
what
they
were
doing
with
this
beer
though
and
would
love
to
have
more
of
them
in
the
future
deep
dark
maroon
color
with
moderate
head
and
what
appears
to
be
moderate
carbonation
you
can
really
smell
the
chocolate
cherry
aroma
really
smooth
the
cherry
and
chocolate
flavors
blend
perfectly
i
drank
most
of
this
before
i
realized
what
happened
flavor
is
dead
on
and
so
is
drinkability
finishes
as
great
as
it
starts
however
we
didnt
discern
any
maltiness
just
a
balanced
chocolate
and
cherry
flavor
good
on
a
cold
winters
night
and
after
a
big
dinner
overall
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
this
if
they
came
out
with
a
6
pack
a
combination
of
two
sam
adams
lesser
beers
resulting
in
another
lesser
beer
a
bit
artificial
tasting
and
too
sweet
i
am
not
going
to
go
in
to
an
in
depth
review
with
this
one
i
was
not
impressed
there
was
basically
a
large
undertone
yes
that
is
an
oxymoron
of
artificial
cherry
in
this
one
the
syrupy
cherry
extract
was
all
that
was
noticed
in
this
one
there
were
some
stoutporter
underpinnings
but
the
cherry
drove
the
bus
not
a
fan
of
this
one
or
any
of
the
cherry
iterations
from
sam
adams
o
overall
thought
the
original
chocolate
bock
was
fairly
decent
with
a
rich
chocolate
base
this
seemed
like
a
decent
beer
combined
with
the
cherry
wheat
to
come
up
with
a
compromise
of
the
two
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
enjoyment
think
this
is
at
best
a
c
beer
decent
but
wouldnt
go
as
far
to
claim
its
good
other
then
a
supplement
to
a
variety
package
for
a
first
try
overall
a
tasty
and
different
one
from
sa
wow
what
can
i
say
i
guess
i
am
partial
to
the
vegetablefruit
types
of
beers
because
this
sam
adams
blew
me
away
the
last
offering
from
the
company
wasnt
so
good
but
this
one
might
very
well
be
the
best
i
have
had
from
sam
adams
the
only
down
points
were
its
head
no
staying
power
or
lacing
and
i
tasted
a
bit
more
cherry
than
the
chocolaty
malts
promised
but
oh
boy
was
it
goooodddd
o
pretty
good
brew
the
cherry
aroma
can
be
a
bit
much
but
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
make
up
for
it
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
little
light
coming
through
and
a
thin
ring
of
offwhite
head
it
looks
quite
nice
scent
dominated
by
maraschino
cherry
aromas
with
hints
of
chocolate
very
sweet
cherry
chocolate
indeed
but
very
one
note
taste
follows
the
aroma
a
lot
of
sweet
chocolate
upfront
moving
into
more
maraschino
cherry
flavors
a
bit
of
a
creamy
flavor
in
the
background
throughout
finish
is
sweet
with
more
cherry
flavors
and
some
chocolate
aftertaste
is
mostly
sweet
chocolate
a
very
sweet
flavor
profile
very
much
a
dessert
beer
but
not
a
very
complex
one
its
a
good
combination
of
flavors
if
you
like
chocolate
and
cherries
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
high
carbonation
that
cuts
down
the
smoothness
of
the
body
quite
a
bit
still
quite
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
nice
feel
though
maybe
a
bit
too
sodalike
overall
this
is
a
decent
dessert
beer
quite
sweet
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
it
could
do
with
being
a
bit
more
beerlike
instead
of
chocolate
covered
cherrylike
but
overall
its
not
bad
its
smooth
drinkable
and
pleasant
enough
my
only
large
complaint
is
that
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
high
and
it
could
do
with
more
bock
in
this
bock
beer
i
certainly
hope
that
sa
either
goes
back
to
the
basic
chocolate
bock
for
the
2014
version
or
pulls
out
the
old
recipe
for
another
attempt
at
the
chocolate
cherry
bock
o
while
the
original
sa
chocolate
bock
is
better
the
addition
of
cherries
this
year
resulted
in
a
sweet
bock
that
is
pretty
good
as
its
own
thing
i
certainly
wouldnt
buy
a
6
pack
full
of
the
stuff
but
its
pleasant
enough
i
like
it
much
better
than
the
cherry
wheat
o
this
is
a
nice
variation
on
their
chocolate
bock
though
i
do
prefer
the
original
damn
close
to
cloying
but
it
works
nicely
as
light
dessert
beer
very
dark
brown
with
only
a
hint
of
red
around
the
edges
a
thin
khaki
head
doesnt
last
long
but
laces
nicely
rather
interesting
aroma
for
this
one
the
normal
dark
malts
and
clean
yeast
of
a
bock
are
present
but
so
too
is
a
very
distinct
cherry
aroma
along
with
sweet
chocolate
i
know
chocolate
is
often
used
to
describe
stouts
and
the
like
but
that
is
always
a
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
type
aroma
this
time
i
get
sweet
milk
chocolate
without
any
bitter
characteristic
at
all
well
there
is
absolutely
no
mistaking
the
cherry
in
this
one
there
is
even
more
cherry
in
here
than
in
the
cherry
wheat
also
produced
by
bbc
it
never
becomes
cloying
however
because
it
is
balanced
by
enough
bitter
malt
and
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
as
well
while
the
cherry
wheat
doesnt
have
this
balance
overall
it
is
fairly
crisp
with
low
to
moderate
levels
of
carbonation
and
a
surprisingly
clean
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
spin
on
the
bock
style
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
winters
night
o
an
interesting
twist
on
their
previous
chocolate
bock
overall
a
decent
brew
not
the
best
of
the
sa
sampler
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
but
its
good
o
the
label
says
chocolate
cherry
and
thats
what
you
get
this
is
a
fun
seasonal
beer
that
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
any
other
way
than
in
the
beers
of
winter
assortment
taste
is
a
subdued
version
of
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
caramel
and
lightly
roasted
chocolate
emerging
with
warming
which
actually
helps
to
balance
the
dessert
like
sweetness
otherwise
present
decent
feel
lightly
bready
in
texture
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
rather
pleasant
though
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
given
its
profile
and
sweetness
coupled
with
a
lack
of
malt
depthcomplexity
had
this
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
porter
glass
a
bit
sweet
but
one
of
the
better
offerings
ive
had
from
sam
in
a
long
time
deep
chocolate
brown
color
and
heavy
body
with
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
sweet
cocoa
and
cherry
aroma
with
a
flavor
to
match
try
it
with
desserts
o
i
was
already
a
big
fan
of
the
regular
chocolate
bock
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
as
well
the
cherry
was
a
nice
compliment
to
the
chocolate
another
good
one
from
sa
o
its
got
chocolate
and
cherry
just
not
in
a
convincing
natural
way
pretty
easy
drinking
but
just
an
okay
beer
o
its
a
cherry
chocolate
bock
and
taste
so
i
personally
like
cherry
and
chocolate
flavors
so
i
enjoy
this
beer
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
malt
cherry
cola
and
chocolate
covered
cherry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
roasted
malt
and
cherry
cola
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
interesting
cherry
cola
presence
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
overall
its
pretty
much
their
cherry
wheat
mixed
with
their
chocolate
bock
not
the
best
cherry
flavor
but
the
chocolate
bock
notes
are
solid
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
faint
garnet
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aromas
of
cherry
overwhelm
my
olfactory
system
tart
sweet
medicinal
cough
drop
conjuring
cherry
aromas
everything
i
hate
about
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
unfortunately
made
it
into
this
beer
light
chocolate
and
burnt
sugars
deep
underneath
i
think
the
flavor
is
sweet
medicinal
cherry
with
bits
of
hersheys
syrup
drizzled
on
top
hints
of
dark
sugary
flavors
are
there
but
little
else
medium
body
with
a
sweet
sticky
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
a
light
level
of
carbonation
i
choked
down
the
last
of
this
bottle
but
on
the
bright
side
my
cough
cleared
up
now
to
pawn
the
remaining
bottle
off
on
some
unsuspecting
christmas
guest
the
feel
is
interesting
its
thick
for
a
bock
but
it
feels
like
soda
at
times
crispness
is
a
little
fluffy
at
the
front
but
its
pretty
smooth
as
it
goes
o
overall
an
okay
beer
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
the
winter
sampler
actually
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
the
beer
did
leave
quite
a
weird
aftertaste
that
i
thought
at
first
were
the
chocolate
malts
not
so
sure
as
it
got
very
medicinal
in
spots
and
felt
artificial
it
wasnt
horrible
as
others
would
have
you
believe
but
it
certainly
isnt
a
bock
and
not
an
excellent
fruit
beer
for
that
matter
either
they
could
have
done
something
really
nice
with
this
had
more
time
been
taken
but
it
is
what
it
is
okay
beer
but
one
that
i
probably
wont
revisit
i
will
give
the
other
bottle
away
to
someone
o
too
sweet
to
session
but
overall
a
beer
that
i
believe
does
what
sa
wanted
it
to
do
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
the
christmas
season
i
am
usually
a
bit
skeptical
with
some
of
the
additives
put
in
beer
but
this
one
is
a
winner
the
bottle
was
part
of
a
12
pack
holiday
sampler
bought
for
14
99
and
so
far
a
very
good
value
send
more
of
these
chocolate
cherry
beers
please
now
i
am
rating
this
beer
for
what
the
brewer
intended
not
necessarily
that
i
think
this
beer
is
overly
amazing
the
beer
poured
a
deep
almost
opaque
dark
amber
with
ecru
head
that
is
not
leaving
much
of
a
lace
the
scent
carries
cherries
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
scent
and
is
very
sweet
almost
like
a
cherry
coke
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
its
decent
too
sweet
for
me
to
session
the
highlight
of
the
winter
box
this
year
and
an
excellent
brew
overall
if
this
was
made
by
three
floyds
or
cigar
city
people
would
rave
about
it
which
pisses
me
off
but
i
love
this
beer
rich
mocha
color
on
the
pour
with
a
slowly
rising
tan
head
with
alright
retention
smells
like
tart
dried
cherries
and
cherry
juice
with
rich
dark
chocolate
and
lager
yeast
well
put
together
and
appropriately
proportioned
on
the
fruit
the
flavor
is
outstanding
with
the
fruit
coming
on
fast
but
not
sweet
and
an
earthy
cocoa
coming
in
to
give
it
a
dessert
vibe
its
layered
and
unique
and
the
cherry
is
just
right
in
intensity
the
finish
is
quick
this
is
a
lager
after
all
and
it
cuts
the
dense
body
and
dark
malt
mouth
coating
with
a
crispness
that
makes
this
beer
awfully
drinkable
a
total
winner
from
sam
adams
here
i
wish
i
could
get
this
around
the
calendar
o
if
this
were
anything
but
a
holiday
beer
it
really
wouldnt
work
pretty
much
a
mix
of
their
chocolate
bock
and
cherry
wheat
its
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
with
nothing
to
balance
one
at
a
time
is
the
only
way
to
drink
this
as
its
a
dessert
in
a
glass
glad
it
only
comes
in
the
mix
pack
because
as
a
sixer
it
would
last
a
bit
longer
than
the
christmas
season
o
if
this
wasnt
so
sweet
i
think
id
like
it
more
i
know
it
was
meant
to
be
sweet
but
it
was
too
sweet
for
me
overall
not
saying
its
disappointing
but
it
could
use
more
more
complexity
it
was
a
decent
beer
strictly
for
novelty
made
it
halfway
through
dumped
and
gave
bottle
2
away
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
barely
decent
and
it
really
isnt
recognizable
as
a
bock
but
i
think
its
a
pretty
average
example
of
a
fruit
infused
dark
beer
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
rich
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
didnt
do
the
best
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
i
have
no
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
i
think
that
artificial
cherry
taste
would
really
wear
on
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
they
were
both
nice
and
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
cherry
aspect
it
was
just
too
artificial
for
me
and
i
would
have
have
liked
it
to
taste
more
natural
and
a
little
tart
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
its
just
not
for
me
and
i
would
only
recommend
it
to
people
who
like
that
same
cherry
aspect
thats
in
their
cherry
wheat
all
in
all
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
i
liked
the
original
chocolate
bock
much
more
and
i
dont
think
the
cherry
helped
this
beer
out
this
was
my
least
favorite
beer
in
this
years
winter
seasonal
variety
pack
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
years
winter
variety
pack
i
thought
last
years
was
much
better
better
luck
next
guys
chocolate
bock
was
fine
just
the
way
it
was
i
just
finally
tried
this
beer
a
month
ago
it
shot
right
to
the
top
10
on
my
list
i
truly
love
the
cherry
and
chocolate
combination
they
have
hit
it
right
on
the
head
w
the
pairing
neither
taste
overwhelming
the
other
my
only
mark
against
it
would
be
the
slightly
flat
taste
of
the
bock
i
would
prefer
it
to
provide
a
bit
headier
pour
may
not
be
possible
otherwise
excellent
work
sam
adams
looked
like
a
very
thick
dark
beer
when
i
initially
poured
it
but
was
slightly
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
smells
like
cherries
and
chocolate
obviously
fairly
tart
but
smooth
im
not
a
fan
of
cherries
so
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
didnt
hate
it
this
is
a
pretty
simple
beer
without
a
lot
of
complexity
but
is
just
as
advertised
i
found
the
chocolate
and
cherries
to
be
nicely
balanced
which
made
for
a
decent
beer
this
wont
make
any
top
beers
list
but
was
a
nice
addition
to
this
years
holiday
pack
some
folks
may
find
that
a
good
thing
ill
pass
thank
you
samuel
adams
cherry
chocolate
bock
35
maybe
i
am
rating
this
a
bit
higher
than
i
should
but
i
reallly
think
this
should
be
rated
about
a
4
0
give
this
one
a
try
o
a
good
cherry
stout
above
average
worth
a
sixer
o
overall
a
very
solid
beer
thanks
jim
and
crew
sadly
they
were
the
first
everyone
drank
from
the
case
will
definitly
drink
this
one
again
and
sad
as
it
is
i
did
not
miss
the
chocolate
bock
this
year
it
was
way
better
with
the
cherry
overall
i
was
really
surprised
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
im
definitely
a
sucker
for
cherries
and
this
beer
did
that
right
for
me
drinkability
is
really
high
what
youll
get
here
is
chocolate
and
cherries
not
a
whole
much
else
and
im
fine
with
that
for
this
beer
my
favorite
beer
from
sam
adams
that
ive
had
so
far
nicely
done
but
i
am
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
overall
a
decent
offering
from
sam
adams
i
like
the
addition
of
cherry
in
this
one
to
add
a
bit
of
tartness
and
sweetness
enjoyable
o
better
than
the
old
chocolate
bock
for
sure
i
like
it
a
lot
just
doesnt
deserve
high
scores
when
its
being
reviewed
as
a
beer
but
i
love
dr
pepper
and
this
tastes
like
a
beer
version
so
im
a
fan
the
taste
lacks
complexity
but
it
might
be
nice
to
sip
on
a
cold
night
in
front
of
a
fire
opretty
tasty
definitely
not
traditional
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
tried
not
to
be
biased
when
trying
this
beer
as
the
original
chocolate
bock
was
my
absolute
favorite
the
color
was
consistent
with
the
original
the
smell
pretty
close
with
a
hint
of
cherry
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sams
cherry
wheat
so
i
assumed
i
would
be
disappointed
with
this
beer
but
in
truth
i
actually
enjoyed
it
not
as
good
as
the
original
and
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
chocolate
flavor
but
it
was
easily
my
favorite
of
the
variety
pack
and
it
lessened
the
emotional
blow
i
took
when
discovering
i
would
be
without
my
beloved
chocolate
bock
for
at
least
another
yearpossible
forever
the
best
way
to
describe
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
to
be
simple
it
tasted
like
a
cherry
tootsie
pop
i
will
definetly
get
at
least
one
more
winter
variety
pack
before
the
season
is
over
because
of
this
beer
not
subtle
in
its
approach
but
ill
bet
this
would
work
just
fine
with
a
chocolate
dessert
on
a
cold
winters
night
poured
one
and
a
half
bottles
into
a
12
liter
stein
a
deep
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
reddish
brown
huea
lighter
tan
colored
head
atopdownhill
from
there
aromas
of
maraschino
cherries
dominate
the
nosejust
artificial
and
overly
sweet
flavors
are
cloying
and
so
artificial
tasting
that
its
hard
to
come
up
with
anything
other
than
sweet
as
far
as
a
profile
goes
it
tastes
like
cherry
syrup
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
i
think
boston
beer
company
is
a
great
and
jim
koch
is
great
but
this
beer
to
me
is
a
slap
in
the
face
to
craft
beer
drinkers
the
verdict
not
bad
the
flavor
is
a
bit
artificial
but
its
not
terrible
kind
of
like
brewing
a
brachs
chocolate
covered
cherry
into
a
beer
sure
there
are
better
brands
of
cordials
out
there
but
for
the
price
and
availability
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
good
bock
characteristics
and
great
flavor
but
theres
still
some
things
missing
here
and
there
the
taste
is
great
but
its
lacking
something
some
more
personality
maybe
that
being
said
its
a
fine
after
dinner
beverage
and
the
cherry
chocolate
thing
its
got
going
on
is
pretty
solid
another
satisfactory
showing
from
sam
adams
recommendations
why
yes
i
do
have
some
dump
in
some
lactose
sweeten
up
the
chocolate
and
tone
down
the
cherry
tartness
a
bit
id
like
to
see
southern
tier
give
a
cherry
cordial
beer
a
whirl
pours
very
dark
you
can
barely
see
through
it
up
to
a
light
the
color
is
a
dark
red
black
head
is
almost
nonexistent
faint
chocolate
smell
and
much
stronger
artificial
cherry
smell
initial
chocolate
taste
and
finishes
with
a
cherry
kick
very
slight
sweetness
but
theres
something
at
the
finish
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
very
artifically
cherryish
somewhat
overwhelming
but
subtle
dark
roasted
feel
that
ends
slightly
bitter
but
not
much
body
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
one
was
expecting
stronger
chocolate
taste
the
cherry
part
is
ok
without
being
too
sweet
light
carbonation
and
light
body
this
one
is
desert
in
a
glass
good
one
for
a
holiday
season
evening
osam
adams
should
just
stop
making
things
with
cherries
o
this
beer
is
a
good
fit
for
the
holiday
pack
for
the
most
part
i
enjoyed
it
its
hard
not
to
be
impressed
at
how
well
the
brewer
brought
out
the
chocolate
and
cherry
at
the
same
time
it
was
a
bit
much
definatly
a
sweet
desert
beer
for
me
the
flavors
are
just
a
bit
too
artificial
overall
this
is
the
third
different
beer
ive
had
with
cherry
in
it
and
none
if
them
were
favorable
this
is
like
a
tootsie
roll
cola
and
i
will
try
to
learn
to
avoid
cherry
beers
from
now
on
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
fairly
favorable
and
sessionable
even
though
theres
only
2
per
sampler
pack
certainly
a
unique
beer
i
see
its
potential
but
as
i
stated
above
the
cherry
was
just
a
bit
much
in
the
taste
for
my
preferences
i
can
only
guess
that
the
reason
this
beer
is
getting
decent
scores
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
can
drink
a
large
quantity
of
soda
in
a
single
sitting
the
color
is
nice
it
looks
like
a
proper
bock
but
thats
about
it
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
the
aroma
is
overly
sweetened
cherries
the
taste
is
like
cherry
coke
gone
off
poured
it
down
the
drain
after
giving
it
a
couple
of
tries
very
disappointed
as
i
usually
love
the
offerings
from
boston
beer
overall
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
but
it
fell
short
of
my
expectations
it
was
decent
but
samuel
adams
chocolate
bock
is
way
better
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours
dark
brown
with
foamy
long
lasting
beige
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
cherries
chocolate
toasted
malt
cacao
and
hint
of
spices
body
full
and
smooth
taste
is
of
cherries
toasted
malt
cacao
and
hint
of
hops
finish
is
long
and
sweet
good
desert
brew
o
to
be
honest
i
was
a
little
nervous
when
i
heard
that
they
added
cherry
to
the
bock
because
i
remembered
the
cherry
wheat
that
to
put
it
in
kind
words
was
like
drinking
cough
syrup
this
however
was
very
well
balanced
and
the
cherries
complimented
the
roasted
notes
very
well
i
never
felt
like
it
was
too
sweet
or
that
there
was
cough
syrup
in
it
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
well
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
and
am
glad
that
the
boston
beer
company
went
for
the
risk
to
change
up
the
annual
bock
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
i
find
this
to
b
the
best
of
the
new
offerings
in
the
winter
pack
and
i
hope
they
bring
this
back
that
said
it
is
like
a
mixture
of
their
cherry
wheat
and
chocolate
bock
but
does
not
work
as
well
as
either
of
those
beers
which
i
adore
i
think
ofallon
has
a
tastier
version
of
a
cherry
chocolate
bock
but
this
one
is
still
fairly
good
overall
the
chocolate
is
a
bit
covered
up
by
the
cherries
but
overall
a
good
beer
a
good
effort
but
this
wouldve
tasted
better
as
just
a
chocolate
bock
or
with
real
cherries
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
really
strong
frothy
head
and
some
persistent
lacing
the
cherry
in
the
nose
pretty
much
overpowers
anything
else
malty
accentuated
with
cherry
but
its
more
bitter
than
sweet
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
this
is
a
very
nice
tasty
winter
brew
im
going
to
see
how
it
tastes
and
feels
as
it
warms
but
im
guessing
that
like
a
porter
it
will
only
improve
the
experience
definitely
worth
buying
a
few
for
the
winter
months
like
many
other
samuel
adams
special
offerings
the
beers
base
taste
is
overly
simplified
and
its
unique
flavor
additions
seem
disjointed
and
artificial
it
simply
lacks
the
true
malt
core
to
pull
the
beer
together
instead
grain
and
mineral
commands
overall
not
too
bad
just
a
bit
too
cherry
for
me
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
chocolate
tasting
beer
but
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
sipper
every
once
and
a
while
well
i
have
3
more
they
will
go
in
time
overall
a
nice
winter
dessert
beer
maybe
something
to
save
for
a
digestif
after
thanksgiving
or
christmas
dinner
the
sweetness
can
get
a
bit
cloying
but
as
a
sipper
after
meal
its
a
nice
treat
would
have
preferred
the
regular
chocolate
bock
in
the
holiday
pack
this
year
also
would
have
preferred
that
they
have
kept
the
holiday
porter
as
part
of
it
too
but
thats
another
story
surprised
by
the
rating
this
is
getting
total
drain
pour
for
me
taste
is
very
artificial
cherry
like
cough
syrup
and
the
bad
taste
lingers
not
picking
up
chocolate
at
all
to
over
powered
by
the
bad
cherry
flavor
very
disappointed
in
this
one
was
the
one
i
was
wanting
to
try
most
from
the
variety
pack
overall
while
a
bit
too
sweet
and
dessert
like
for
a
regular
going
to
an
occasional
encounter
is
in
line
as
it
makes
for
a
good
drinking
alternative
to
a
sweet
dessert
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
one
inch
light
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
excellent
lace
smell
is
more
cherry
than
chocolate
with
vanilla
blended
in
with
the
others
taste
is
chocolate
to
start
then
the
cherry
and
vanilla
comes
in
at
the
finish
body
is
medium
nice
amount
of
carbonation
not
dry
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
a
bit
different
dont
drink
it
to
cold
the
flavors
really
blend
well
as
it
warms
low
c
while
the
aroma
tends
to
favor
the
cherry
the
taste
tends
to
favor
the
chocolate
but
both
flavors
are
there
mild
bitterness
if
that
is
the
correct
term
but
it
has
a
slight
lingering
quality
at
the
end
very
nice
o
overall
sas
chocolate
cherry
bock
gives
me
the
impression
of
melted
candy
im
sure
others
would
like
it
and
its
along
the
lines
of
what
i
expected
but
its
not
for
me
d
kind
of
a
one
note
beer
to
me
and
one
that
you
need
to
be
in
the
mood
for
fortunately
i
enjoy
cordials
from
time
to
time
during
the
winter
and
could
easily
find
two
times
to
be
in
the
mood
to
drink
this
not
something
id
want
a
six
pack
of
but
i
like
it
as
something
different
in
the
winter
12
pack
this
is
a
nice
beer
its
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
cherrychocolate
bock
its
not
something
id
want
to
drink
a
ton
of
but
one
bottle
in
a
sitting
is
enjoyable
i
like
it
though
and
is
a
fitting
beer
for
the
holidays
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
very
small
tan
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
perfect
carbonation
actually
the
aroma
of
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
hits
you
right
in
the
nose
at
first
very
nice
of
course
the
taste
of
cocoa
powder
and
slightly
artificial
cherry
taste
like
a
halls
cough
drop
still
wasnt
bad
at
all
not
nearly
as
good
as
chocolate
bock
i
guess
i
miss
that
one
this
year
after
having
this
one
its
still
a
holiday
bock
and
it
just
barely
works
for
a
bock
its
got
character
ill
give
it
that
o
not
bad
by
any
means
but
slightly
disappointing
i
found
myself
wishing
this
was
a
chocolate
cherry
stout
i
think
if
it
was
a
stout
instead
of
a
bock
allowing
the
chocolate
flavors
to
be
more
natural
this
could
be
a
hit
o
interesting
brew
kind
of
tip
toes
the
line
of
being
a
beer
as
it
tastes
and
feels
like
a
soda
i
actually
like
it
though
not
something
id
go
to
often
but
definitely
worth
a
try
an
excellent
replacement
to
the
original
chocolate
bock
it
is
the
sole
reason
why
i
wait
to
drink
this
one
last
in
the
winter
variety
pack
nice
dark
brown
color
average
head
and
all
around
smoothness
addictive
to
drink
all
day
long
especially
winter
so
soothing
it
is
unreal
o
tastes
like
one
of
those
cheap
chocolate
covered
cherry
cordials
it
was
interesting
id
drink
it
again
its
good
in
small
doses
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
cherries
i
have
always
hated
cherry
cordial
candy
but
i
admit
this
bock
is
not
bad
i
really
was
sure
i
would
not
like
this
but
my
mind
has
been
changed
this
isnt
something
i
would
seek
out
but
im
pleasantly
pleased
with
this
brew
on
the
negative
side
i
feel
that
cherry
presence
really
overpowers
the
other
flavors
cheers

i
preferred
the

im
getting

the
cherry
and
chocolate
ov
i
really
get
what
sam
adams
is
doing
here
i
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
and
i
thought
they
accomplished
what
they
were
shooting
for
i
could
drink
it
all
holiday
season
smell
of
cherries
and
malt
hit
my
nose
instantly
as
it

first
taste

candies
it

this
beer
was
delicious
and
would
make
a
great
desert
drink
might
be
great
if
made
into
a
float
with
vanilla
or
cherry
ice
cream
would
love
to
buy
this
again
overall
i
would
attempt
to
avoid
this
overall
the
quality
falls
right
in

with
the
boston

offerings
from

co
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
chocolate
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
faint
cherry
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
quaffable
chocolate
and

delicious
yet
not
overly
done
its
incredibly
easy
drinking
even
at
7
it
goes
down
quick
with
a
sweet
almost
milk
stout
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
dessert
style
beer
it
doesnt
wimp
out
on
chocolate
flavor
the
cherry
taste
is
mild
at
best
but
goes
a
long
way
in
rounding
out
the
taste
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
chocolate
bock
or
now
this
chocolate
cherry
bock
apparently
they
just
arent
for
me
that
being
said
the
ice
cream
churchills
pub
grille
made
using
this
ice
cream
was
fantastic
mo
this
beer
was
on
tap
at
rfd
in
dc
very
complex
and
balanced
beer
good
for
the
winter
time
and
very
good
with
desserts
chocolate
cherry
bock
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
whitish
head
there
was
a
nice
sweet
smell
mostly
from
the
chocolate
the
taste
was
rather
sweet
alot
of
chocolate
and
cherry
but
it
blended
very
well
with
just
a
bit
of
a
smokey
malty
undertone
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
had
a
nice
strong
flavor
overall
a
very
nice
desert
type
beer
i
wasnt
impressed
with
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
but
this
one
with
cherries
is
like
a
candy
bar
and
i
was
very
impressed
i
loved
this
beer
i
originally
had
the
look
a
4
5
but
dropped
it
down
after
some
consideration
im
a
bit
of
a
sam
adams
homer
but
this
may
have
been
the
best
i
tried
o
not
a
bad
beer
just
a
bit
to
one
sided
for
my
liking
another
surprise
sam
adams
taponly
offering
at
lm
i
guess
i
should
stop
being
so
surprised
right
anyway
it
pours
a
dark
rubytinted
blackbrown
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
ashen
foam
the
nose
explodes
with
black
cherry
with
a
light
bit
of
roasted
malts
behind
the
din
its
pleasant
indeed
but
seems
a
bit
onesided
the
taste
holds
notes
of
somewhatartificialseeming
black
cherry
chocolate
powder
light
roasted
malts
toasted
caramel
and
a
hint
of
toasted
coconut
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
feel
overall
a
nice
beer
but
the
cherry
seems
to
have
diluted
the
usually
very
nice
chocolate
bock
id
have
another
if
given
the
chance
but
i
wouldnt
be
as
eager
to
do
so
as
i
was
this
time
i
usually
find
chocolate
bocks
to
be
disappointing
but
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
speaking
of
subtlety
there
is
none
in
this
beer
it
is
chocolatey
like
hershey
syrup
and
cherryflavored
like
cherry
coke
in
other
words
it
tasted
like
it
was
loaded
with
sugars
and
artificial
flavoring
no
love
the
bock
part
of
the
beer
is
just
an
afterthought
i
cant
review
this
like
any
other
bock
because
the
additives
totally
wreck
it
to
artificial
to
be
enjoyable
not
something
i
would
recommend
sam
adams
does
some
very
nice
beers
but
their
fruits
beers
are
not
among
them
overall
impression
a
well
done
fruit
beer
it
has
elements
of
chocolate
and
cherry
while
still
retaining
good
base
beer
characteristics
thats
hard
to
do
and
this
was
well
done
this
is
a
fun
beer
theres
a
lot
going
on
and
the
flavors
change
and
intensify
as
the
beer
warms
its
rich
and
dessertlike
its
sweet
its
smooth
its
good
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
mouthfeel
this
is
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
even
with
the
cherry
man
it
goes
down
very
easy
o
better
than
expected
went
perfectly
with
the
cherry
chocolate
cake
it
was
paired
with
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
a
bit
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
flavorful
stoutlike
lager
to
drink
for
a
while
o
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
a
few
glass
of
this
throughout
the
night
overall
i
think
this
is
a
quite
nice
and
interesting
beer
i
think
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
the
cherry
character
is
really
nice
in
this
and
it
mixes
well
with
the
chocolate
flavors
i
would
drink
this
one
again
o
great
beer
possibly
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
from
sa
definitely
in
the
top
3
perfectly
executed
balance
of
flavors
high
carbonation
gives
a
creamy
sensation
along
with
the
malt
content
this
is
really
like
drinking
an
alcoholic
cherry
cordial
i
had
this
one
at
the
west
point
market
in
akron
pours
a
nice
light
colored
head
but
it
fades
away
quickly
it
has
a
nice
red
hue
to
it
as
well
you
can
smell
the
chocolate
right
off
the
bat
the
first
taste
highlights
the
cherry
flavor
but
falls
into
one
of
the
best
chocolate
flavors
ive
seen
in
a
beer
the
alcohol
is
not
subtle
at
all
but
works
with
the
cherries
to
really
bring
out
a
great
flavor
its
not
overly
sweet
either
im
not
always
that
big
of
a
fan
of
sam
adams
stuff
but
this
one
is
great
im
gonna
have
to
pick
this
one
up
again
on
my
next
trip
out
to
the
market
the
beer
sadly
does
not
live
up
to
the
overwhelming
cherry
aroma
in
fact
all
i
taste
is
cherry
with
just
a
lingering
of
chocolate
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
what
happened
to
the
beer
would
have
again
if
it
was
available
recommended
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
definitely
worth
it
pours
a
very
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
fingers
width
of
khaki
colored
head
smells
very
subtle
but
of
a
traditional
bock
maybe
some
malt
and
chocolate
tastes
is
well
balanced
with
cherrys
and
dark
chocolate
subtle
hints
of
yeast
delicious
slighty
drying
dark
chocolate
and
cherry
end
i
actually
like
this
a
lot
im
surprised
at
how
well
balanced
it
is
i
thought
the
cherry
in
this
would
be
like
the
sam
cherry
wheat
where
its
just
a
little
too
overbearing
but
nope
pleasantly
suprised
this
beer
was
poured
out
and
served
with
dessert
last
night
at
the
spinnerstown
hotel
the
beer
came
to
us
and
looked
nice
and
dark
in
color
almost
like
a
porter
or
stout
the
head
had
almost
completely
vanished
by
the
time
i
got
my
glass
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
pretty
nice
it
had
a
very
sweet
smelling
cherry
aroma
filling
my
nose
along
with
just
a
bit
of
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
is
sweet
with
loads
of
cherry
the
dark
chocolate
kind
of
shows
up
late
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
it
was
well
carbonated
and
was
drinkable
overall
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
basically
a
blend
of
the
cherry
wheat
and
the
chocolate
back
that
is
released
in
the
winter
there
really
isnt
too
much
special
about
it
other
than
it
goes
well
with
a
sweet
dessert
to
be
honest
that
beer
could
have
been
dessert
and
it
would
have
done
the
job
just
fine
this
is
the
beer
i
was
anticipating
the
most
from
the
beer
dinner
and
it
turned
out
to
probably
be
my
least
favorite
i
have
to
admit
this
beer
is
really
outstanding
im
not
saying
the
boston
beer
company
is
bad
by
any
means
but
even
this
for
them
is
top
notch
ive
had
their
chocolate
bock
before
and
did
enjoy
it
but
the
addition
of
cherry
just
gives
this
beer
a
completely
different
complexity
that
is
just
downright
delicious
o
not
your
typical
bock
beer
but
it
was
never
supposed
to
be
if
you
like
sweet
fruity
beers
you
will
like
this
one
but
if
that
isnt
your
thing
you
might
want
to
avoid
this
one
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
snifter
glass
it
has
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
body
with
not
a
lot
of
head
that
lays
down
to
a
thin
brown
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
of
maraschino
cherries
with
nice
chocolate
notes
coming
through
too
the
taste
is
so
nice
and
balanced
of
cherry
and
chocolate
with
the
roasted
malt
on
back
of
the
tongue
great
mouth
feel
and
overall
a
exceptional
beer
o
this
was
a
nice
experiment
from
sam
adams
the
flavors
are
that
of
the
name
so
you
will
not
be
disappointed
good
for
dessert
you
wont
want
more
than
one
especially
with
a
slice
devils
food
cake
narrative
tyler
wiped
his
brow
profusely
come
on
tyler
hold
it
together
this
deal
is
almost
sealed
hold
it
together
he
reassured
himself
he
looked
nervously
over
at
the
produce
crates
and
fidgeted
with
his
apron
well
tyler
i
must
say
you
are
by
far
the
most
reasonable
cherry
wholesaler
we
have
encounter
vastly
lower
than
all
other
offers
we
are
inclined
to
buy
from
you
yearround
tyler
swallowed
hard
and
looked
at
the
crates
labeled
cherrys
and
began
to
fidget
nervously
yeah
we
we
always
try
and
you
know
get
the
cherries
only
cherries
that
well
you
know
the
manager
of
cost
u
cheap
foods
looked
askance
at
tyler
and
moved
towards
the
crates
tyler
these
you
know
these
are
juniper
berries
right
these
arent
even
cherries
where
did
you
get
these
is
this
a
joke
tyler
shot
up
out
of
his
seat
once
again
the
jig
was
up
somehow
every
produce
manager
that
he
encountered
knew
exactly
what
a
cherry
looked
like
and
apparently
this
was
wholly
dissimilar
to
juniper
berries
you
didnt
even
give
them
a
try
he
cried
out
and
spiked
his
apron
on
the
ground
in
frustration
before
bolting
out
of
the
room
o
i
think
that
this
a
top
notch
quality
beer
it
is
beautifully
balanced
and
has
all
the
right
flovors
while
it
may
not
be
exact
to
bock
style
the
credit
is
deserved
for
overall
beer
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
a
keg
of
this
i
could
drink
this
regularly
but
the
sweetness
makes
this
a
bit
of
a
novelty
i
find
it
to
be
a
perfect
dessert
beer
and
wish
it
was
available
around
the
holidays
sampled
at
the
cleveland
beer
fest
pours
a
hazy
brownblack
with
a
thin
beige
head
smells
like
a
chocolate
covered
cherry
taste
is
big
cherry
chocolate
and
a
lot
of
sweetness
light
to
medium
bodied
does
not
have
that
bock
malt
but
nice
and
sweet
light
caramel
malt
for
the
style
not
bad
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
get
it
again
after
one
pint
i
doubt
i
could
have
another
one
it
got
a
bit
heavy
towards
the
end
this
also
reminded
me
of
a
cherry
soda
this
drank
very
easily
certainly
a
different
beer
and
glad
i
tried
it
this
is
a
lager
i
could
get
into
this
beer
is
a
joke
but
its
a
pleasant
laugh
down
memory
lane
nice
to
try
one
time
but
i
cant
really
see
any
reason
to
ever
try
this
again
o
this
was
a
real
treat
like
drinking
dessert
id
definitely
order
this
over
and
over
again
but
probably
not
more
than
a
pint
at
one
sitting
unless
i
was
feeling
like
a
fatty
and
wanted
an
extra
slice
of
liquid
cake
o
this
was
one
of
the
best
beers
i
had
at
the
festival
and
i
had
more
than
a
few
samples
i
almost
expected
the
cherry
flavor
to
be
too
much
but
it
was
definitely
balanced
by
the
chocolate
and
roasty
flavors
as
well
if
they
bottled
this
i
would
definitely
buy
it
o
overall
a
very
nice
interesting
bock
i
enjoyed
the
nose
a
lot
as
it
reminded
me
of
black
cherry
soda
and
thought
the
chocolate
and
cherries
worked
well
together
would
certainly
have
it
again
though
not
sure
if
i
would
want
more
than
one
glass
in
a
single
night
o
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
i
thought
the
abv
was
hidden
well
overall
while
drinking
this
beer
sam
adams
needs
to
bottle
this
one
the
flavors
really
were
blended
well
together
and
this
one
shows
what
can
happen
when
sam
adams
takes
the
time
to
actually
brew
the
taste
is
good
as
it
has
a
pretty
strong
cherry
and
chocolate
taste
which
lives
up
to
the
name
however
it
causes
the
bock
base
to
get
a
little
lost
in
the
flavor
i
get
a
light
malt
in
the
middle
after
some
of
the
cherry
zing
and
chocolate
pizzazz
wheres
off
slightly
this
bock
finishes
fruity
and
semisweet
with
gentle
bitterness
overall
an
ok
bock
it
would
probably
appeal
to
those
who
like
sweet
and
fruity
beers
more
than
the
craft
fan
but
it
is
not
your
average
bock
and
you
know
that
going
in
slightly
spicy
and
thick
mouthfeel
it
would
be
tough
to
get
more
than
one
down
at
a
sitting
too
sweet
for
everyday
consumption
but
a
tasty
beverage
nonetheless
o
very
enjoyable
would
go
good
with
steak
or
pork
i
would
purchase
again
if
they
continue
to
produce
o
the
cinnamon
and
pepper
are
well
balanced
leaving
me
wanting
more
with
each
sip
well
done
o
a
sweet
but
intriguing
brew
thats
certainly
worth
trying
did
not
mix
too
well
with
the
end
of
my
dinner
but
worked
great
as
an
after
meal
sipper
dark
brown
with
both
ruby
and
copper
edges
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
with
slight
chocolate
undertones
the
flavor
profile
is
mostly
reminiscent
of
a
mild
bock
with
some
faint
chocolate
notes
and
a
hint
of
chili
heat
this
is
an
enjoyable
offering
and
works
well
as
a
little
nightcap
just
before
bed
almost
3
years
old
deep
onyx
body
with
a
frothy
chocolate
head
its
more
reminiscent
of
a
stout
in
appearance
aroma
is
chocolatey
dark
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
malt
fruitiness
mild
melanoidins
and
a
hint
of
chili
dark
chocolate
dominates
the
flavor
with
an
almost
dark
cherry
specialty
malt
fruitiness
lingering
into
the
finish
somewhat
fat
in
flavour
with
rich
malt
sweetness
that
is
not
quite
cloying
overall
a
bit
sweetheavy
for
me
something
more
safe
and
grounded
on
the
palate
would
keep
me
coming

a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
was
fortunate
to
find
a
bottle
of
this
laying
around
when
i
picked
it
up
i
was
thinking
that
the
pepper
would
be
all
gone
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
there
was
still
decent
heat
especially
in
the
aftertaste
as
the
beer
warmed
while
i
would
have
liked
more
heat
my
problem
with
this
beer
is
more
the
chocolate
flavors
that
were
ok
but
far
from
the
best
i
have
had
it
seems
like
the
dark
chocolate
and
milk
chocolate
do
not
mesh
as
well
here
as
in
other
beers
would
love
to
try
this
one
fresh
but
in
reading
other
reviews
the
taste
seems
to
hold
up
o
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
despite
some
flaws
might
be
a
shade
too
sweet
could
have
used
a
little
more
chilies
but
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
when
in
the
mood
overall
im
glad
it
didnt
my
mouth
or
south
end
but
i
wanted
more
out
of
a
chili
chocolate
bock
called
the
vixen
i
was
expecting
some
s
m
maybe
get
slapped
around
a
bitit
wouldnt
have
hurt
the
balance
glad
to
see
this
in
a
12
ounce
format
as
part
of
a
lager
mixed
case
i
picked
up
in
pa
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
review
because
it
tastes
nothing
like
the
description
of
the
beer
nothing
about
this
says
bock
and
there
is
zero
chili
or
heat
i
get
the
chocolate
and
i
get
the
nibs
but
thats
about
it
this
comes
across
as
a
basic
flavored
ale
the
aroma
has
hints
of
chocolate
but
nothing
spicy
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
bock
but
this
is
pretty
good
very
drinkable
at
8
5
the
chili
and
chocolate
are
very
faint
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
very
surprised
with
this
beer
ive
had
some
of
the
imperial
series
and
still
dont
consider
sam
adams
one
of
my
favorites
but
this
one
avoided
the
taste
that
seems
to
come
with
every
other
sam
adams
beer
ive
ever
had
not
bashing
on
sam
adams
either
its
just
that
a
few
of
their
craft
brews
are
not
even
close
to
standard
overall
very
good
i
might
just
have
to
try
some
of
the
others
of
this
series
despite
this
pleasant
lightness
i
feel
like
the
beer
could
be
richer
and
more
exciting
overall
its
still
pretty
solid
but
it
doesnt
really
run
with
the
potential
it
shows
it
could
use
more
of
something
chilli
chocolate
goat
whatever
it
needs
bring
it
in
the
next
iteration
please
o
the
sublte
quality
of
the
chili
is
what
makes
this
beer
so
great
in
my
opinion
the
sharpness
following
the
sweet
chocolate
makes
the
vixen
exactly
that
better
than
i
expected
it
would
be
the
first
few
sips
were
amazing
before
it
settled
down
a
good
warming
brew
for
a
chilly
night
definitely
the
best
of
the
4
beers
from
the
sa
small
batch
gift
pack
overall
a
little
disappointed
this
is
utterly
forgettable
no
complexity
bland
all
the
way
around
o
this
is
a
good
brew
interesting
take
on
a
bock
o
i
thought
this
was
a
really
cool
beer
i
love
chili
chocolate
to
begin
with
so
when
i
found
this
beer
i
had
to
try
it
of
course
chocolate
and
beer
and
chili
and
beer
are
a
great
mix
so
this
takes
advantage
of
both
in
one
bottle
its
an
interesting
idea
with
the
chocolate
and
chilies
o
the
vixen
is
a
nice
bock
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
and
slightly
spicy
not
bad
but
not
not
really
any
better
than
the
polish
porters
i
can
compare
it
to
since
it
drinks
more
like
a
porter
than
a
bock
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
heat
being
a
chocolate
chili
bock
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
chocolate
doppelbock
and
i
would
drink
this
again
a
little
disappointing
too
sweet
with
no
heat
balance
comes
off
like
a
sweet
milk
stout
overall
excellent
brew
reminded
me
of
some
of
the
real
aztec
chocolate
drinks
i
had
in
the
carribean
not
the
sugar
sweetened
chocolate
crap
we
have
here
in
the
states
but
real
spiced
chocolate
drinks
that
are
not
sweetened
o
a
decent
harmony
with
the
beer
and
added
ingredients
the
cocoa
nibs
are
the
most
prominent
with
the
other
declared
spices
taking
a
decidedly
secondary
role
the
base
bock
is
well
done
and
its
probably
the
best
chocolate
beer
ive
had
from
boston
beer
company
for
improvement
though
id
like
to
see
more
chili
kick
as
advertised
o
didnt
think
i
would
get
the
chance
to
have
this
as
it
was
1
of
2
missing
from
my
batch
series
collection
now
that
i
have
had
it
this
beer
was
definitely
worth
the
wait
and
the
price
its
a
bock
i
get
it
just
too
damn
sweet
for
my
liking
not
enough
chili
pepper
or
chocolate
to
back
this
beer
up
played
it
very
safe
here
my
first
time
having
chili
in
a
beer
and
it
was
pretty
good
not
as
much
chocolate
as
i
would
have
thought
but
just
the
right
amount
of
chili
id
definitely
have
it
again
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
from
sam
adams
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
creamy
beige
head
not
too
dark
to
see
its
color
in
the
light
pretty
nice
looking
and
the
head
sticks
around
for
quite
awhile
aroma
is
a
surprisingly
mild
theres
some
light
cocoa
caramel
chili
pepper
spice
a
touch
of
cinnamon
and
some
very
light
roast
character
whats
there
is
decent
but
you
have
to
look
for
it
the
taste
is
better
theres
more
pepper
flavor
and
mild
but
noticeable
spice
and
that
spice
blends
well
with
the
chocolate
flavor
the
chocolate
is
still
just
kinda
sweet
and
boring
its
nice
enough
but
there
are
much
more
interesting
chocolate
chili
beers
around
fairly
clean
finish
some
lingering
caramelchocolate
flavor
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
its
a
fine
beer
but
the
flavors
need
to
be
refined
and
amped
up
that
said
i
do
think
its
a
big
improvement
on
the
normal
sa
chocolate
bock
a
solid
if
simple
beer
pours
black
with
a
very
short
head
and
no
lacing
the
chocolate
and
chili
are
pretty
prominent
in
the
nose
and
there
is
a
bit
of
vinous
sourness
as
well
the
taste
is
nice
with
well
balanced
flavors
of
rich
chocolate
and
spicy
chili
always
a
nice
combination
pretty
well
done
smooth
in
the
mouth
and
quite
drinkable
m
surprisingly
bright
mediumfull
body
o
looking
forward
to
having
this
again
this
would
be
great
inwith
a
nice
bowl
of
chili
on
a
cold
day
really
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
a
bargin
at
3
50
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
chocolatecocoa
really
overpowers
everything
else
probably
wouldnt
get
this
one
again
c
d
nicely
done
the
chili
character
is
restrained
while
the
chocolate
is
robust
which
is
a
wise
balance
for
a
beer
that
contains
these
elements
not
as
complex
as
some
chilichocolate
imperial
stouts
that
i
have
had
but
it
is
flavorful
and
smooth
so
i
guess
it
is
what
one
would
expect
for
a
spiced
bock
overall
i
wanted
more
chili
flavor
out
of
this
one
the
base
beer
is
smooth
with
nice
chocolate
notes
i
was
hoping
for
more
with
this
one
as
good
a
lager
as
ive
had
very
drinkable
given
all
thats
going
on
in
the
glass
a
good
selection
from
sam
adams
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
brown
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
up
front
with
a
touch
of
pepper
mixed
in
the
flavor
has
the
same
components
but
in
different
ratios
i
really
like
the
way
the
peppers
were
done
in
this
beer
adding
some
great
flavor
as
well
as
a
hint
of
heat
in
the
throat
the
chocolate
also
really
stands
out
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
the
heat
from
the
chilies
is
really
nice
with
the
cocoa
and
spices
nicely
balanced
overall
i
really
wish
they
had
done
more
with
this
great
concept
somewhat
lacking
in
followthrough
the
dark
brown
color
of
the
beer
bordered
on
black
and
the
pour
resulted
in
a
large
three
finger
thick
head
atop
it
the
smell
was
chocolate
and
red
apples
and
did
not
seem
to
give
any
indication
of
the
spicing
the
taste
was
good
but
a
little
simpler
than
the
ingredients
hinted
at
there
was
a
some
chocolate
up
front
followed
by
brown
sugar
and
some
salt
and
ending
with
cinnamon
i
really
couldnt
detect
much
chili
presence
other
than
a
faint
hint
which
i
would
have
easily
missed
if
blind
tasting
the
body
was
a
little
thicker
than
a
typical
bock
but
the
spices
made
it
less
soothing
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
better
than
it
was
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
3
055
yknow
i
remember
this
one
being
better
final
thoughts
very
good
beer
i
enjoy
the
balance
of
deep
flavor
but
keeping
it
flow
with
the
body
this
beer
is
what
it
says
it
is
its
got
more
earthy
chilicinnamon
then
i
was
expecting
was
expecting
a
bit
of
a
red
hots
cinnamon
and
cayenne
heat
chili
but
it
all
flows
i
would
buy
this
again
a
nice
interesting
beer
goes
down
fairly
easy
considering
the
strength
and
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
if
you
are
looking
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
or
just
a
really
nice
beer
give
this
one
a
try
saw
a
beer
in
a
magazine
about
beer
called
the
vixen
given
the
ingredient
list
of
chili
cinnamon
and
cocoa
nibs
i
knew
i
had
to
pict
this
one
up
samuel
adams
has
a
history
of
making
good
chocolate
bocks
the
christmas
one
stands
out
it
doesnt
have
a
thick
head
but
it
is
an
attractive
tan
it
smells
of
cocoa
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
intriguing
the
strongest
tastes
are
the
cocoa
and
the
cinnamon
but
the
finish
definitely
has
the
taste
of
chili
it
gives
the
beer
a
rich
taste
that
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
silky
i
have
to
say
this
is
definitely
a
nice
surprise
was
almost
i
wouldnt
find
a
bottle
of
this
one
i
guess
i
was
looking
for
a
little
heat
from
chilii
peppers
but
its
not
there
still
the
beer
has
a
great
mouthfeel
chocolate
flavor
and
is
a
nice
dessert
brew
i
say
skip
past
this
one
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
variation
of
style
this
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
sam
adams
bockstyle
beer
with
the
added
advertised
attributes
overall
a
very
solid
version
of
a
bock
nice
robust
malts
and
chocolate
the
spices
are
subtle
but
noticeable
enough
to
add
a
interesting
kick
overall
this
drinks
exactly
like
their
chocolate
bock
go
figure
luckily
that
was
probably
my
favorite
of
their
releases
this
winter
you
get
plenty
of
the
chocolate
flavors
which
are
complemented
by
the
roasted
malts
unfortunately
the
chili
doesnt
shine
through
quite
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
every
time
i
see
a
beer
that
includes
chili
peppers
im
looking
at
you
theobroma
i
wish
for
some
actual
spice
and
a
bit
of
heat
to
shine
through
all
around
a
great
beer
from
sam
adams
ill
have
to
try
a
few
more
from
this
new
line
doa
o
actually
a
decent
beer
from
sa
i
have
been
pretty
unimpressed
with
this
series
so
far
and
this
one
actually
works
pretty
well
not
a
bad
beer
the
flavors
work
but
the
bock
portion
is
a
little
weak
worth
checking
out
taste
is
good
lots
of
chocolate
with
a
light
hint
of
red
chilies
chipotleesque
without
the
heat
a
deft
touch
indeed
very
smooth
the
carbonation
is
soft
and
light
which
works
well
for
the
beer
abv
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
body
is
silky
smooth
while
maintaining
a
light
bockish
feel
this
is
my
second
bottle
bought
and
wouldnt
mind
having
another
some
time
down
the
road
o
a
great
bock
a
nice
surprise
from
sam
adams
and
one
i
will
buy
more
of
o
pretty
decent
stuff
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
chocolate
bock
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
whole
chili
beer
concept
but
this
works
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
cook
with
too
i
can
see
it
in
a
nice
chili
con
carne
the
only
beer
of
this
sam
adams
limited
release
series
that
i
enjoy
wish
the
rest
of
them
turned
out
like
this
notes
a
conservative
bock
with
interesting
qualities
i
will
be
buying
another
couple
overall
solid
b
well
crafted
and
nicely
executed
thanks
john
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
but
as
it
often
happens
with
sam
adams
beers
it
seems
like
they
dont
stick
their
necks
out
quite
far
enough
it
seems
like
this
one
is
peters
a
little
too
much
on
the
safe
side
it
could
be
brewed
in
a
slightly
more
interesting
way
perhaps
not
at
all
a
bad
brew
though
this
beer
has
a
dark
black
body
with
a
2
tan
color
head
that
lays
down
quickly
the
smell
is
faint
of
chocolate
with
a
little
malt
the
taste
has
a
nice
chocolate
malt
flavor
up
front
then
a
very
light
chili
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
a
good
beer
i
wanted
a
little
more
heat
o
not
a
terribly
impressive
beer
the
chocolate
and
chili
are
both
lacking
which
combined
with
a
watery
body
and
a
strong
licorice
flavor
make
for
a
disappointment
osolid
beer
just
expected
more
heat
and
chili
taste
the
name
the
dark
look
and
8
5
made
me
expect
a
tongue
bruiser
i
do
wish
this
beer
would
have
lived
up
to
its
name
mildly
disappointed
22
oz
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
tanned
long
lasting
foamy
head
and
soda
like
carbonation
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
spices
some
chocolate
and
cacao
notes
the
body
is
medium
and
smooth
taste
is
toasted
malt
caramel
cinnamon
pepper
sweet
cacao
and
chocolate
long
very
spicy
finish
interesting
brew
but
it
is
too
sweet
for
me
pepper
provides
a
burning
sensation
but
does
not
offset
sweetness
like
hops
do
o
decent
bock
sams
adams
always
has
good
beers
but
never
great
beers
this
is
a
strong
beer
masked
nicely
by
the
malt
and
sweetness
o
was
really
expecting
more
of
the
spices
and
chilies
to
come
through
but
then
again
its
sam
adams
and
they
never
go
to
the
extreme
and
always
like
playing
it
safe
overall
a
oneofakind
brew
dark
rich
and
enticing
some
serious
heat
from
the
chillies
and
the
alcohol
at
the
end
not
an
easy
drinker
by
any
means
but
unique
and
interesting
flavor
profile
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
almost
black
with
a
tan
foam
collar
that
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
but
sticks
around
for
an
impressive
amount
of
time
smells
mostly
of
bitter
chocolate
but
a
tiny
amount
of
roasted
character
does
also
come
through
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
mostly
chocolate
but
also
has
some
dark
fruits
and
cinnamon
swimming
around
in
a
bock
toasted
malt
finish
is
where
the
gentle
warming
of
the
chiles
within
shows
up
as
a
sort
of
indirect
lip
warming
sensation
and
a
tickling
in
the
nasal
passages
texture
is
medium
thick
yet
creamy
overall
it
comes
across
exactly
as
though
they
added
chiles
to
their
chocolate
bock
not
that
this
is
a
bad
thing
very
dark
coloured
slightly
spicy
aroma
the
taste
is
of
a
rather
basic
bock
enhanced
by
a
little
heat
and
lots
of
chocolate
as
if
the
chocolate
is
to
make
up
for
the
bock
taste
everything
is
ok
by
itself
but
the
characteristics
are
not
well
integrated
decent
drinkability
medium
mouthfeel
as
beer
warms
and
progresses
the
chilis
get
to
me
heartburn
alert
the
remainder
is
dumped
overall
seems
to
be
the
chocolate
bock
given
a
boost
and
an
addition
of
chilies
cinnamon
and
love
im
down
for
that
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
im
not
sure
i
would
have
it
again
the
powdery
characteristics
in
my
opinion
detracted
from
the
overall
balance
and
drinkability
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
1

taste
is
chocolate
some
chili
spicyness
very
rich
and
flavorful
feels
full

in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
enjoyable
beer
worth
seeking
out
poured

dissipates
quickly
to

with

is
interesting
dark

dominated
by
chocolate
and
a
hint
of

the
chilies
appear
in
the
finish
and
work
quite
nicely
making
an
interesting
flavor
progression
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
play
between
the
chili
and
the
carbonation
for
a
peppery
mouthfeel
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
interesting
ad
tasty
d
this
is
fairly
drinkable
but
my
expectations
were
such
that
i
had
trouble
polishing
it
off
as
i
expected
great
idea
but
flavors
need
to
be
much
bolder
o
bad
no
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
glad
to
try
it
but
wont
buy
again
very
interesting
beer
nice
dark
color
good
head
very
nice
poor
the
smell
was
a
bit
faint
i
did
pick
up
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
chili
the
taste
was
good
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
good
i
was
thinking
more
robust
but
it
was
a
very
good
blend
of
sweet
and
spicy
a
but
on
the
subtle
side
but
over
all
good
from
the
complexity
and
verity
of
flavors
the
palate
has
its
work
cut
out
for
it
over
all
a
little
light
on
the
taste
but
for
what
it
is
not
bad
at
all
this
one
snuck
up
on
me
i
was
not
expecting
to
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
did
major
kudos
to
sam
adams
for
making
such
a
uniqueoriginalfun
beer
i
expect
this
type
of
thing
from
dfh
not
sa
o
a
pretty
good
beer
that
just
misses
the
mark
of
being
rememberable
ochocolate
chili
bock
the
name
sounds
so
intriguing
it
has
so
much
potential
however
this
was
sure
a
let
down
i
know
samuel
adams
every
once
in
awhile
pleases
me
but
most
often
im
disappointed
so
i
shouldnt
have
got
my
hopes
up
for
this
either
they
should
basically
just
leave
the
word
chili
out
of
the
name
it
adds
nothing
to
the
beer
and
is
probably
just
used
to
trick
people
in
to
drinking
it
over
priced
as
well
easy
drinker
for
the
abv
but
was
expecting
more
complexity
and
some
spice
disregarding
the
name
definitely
true
to
the
style
and
interestingly
different
just
dont
compare
it
with
chili
beers
flavor
is
some
sweet
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
i
do
get
a
little
tingly
warmth
that
could
be
chilli
pepper
but
no
cinnamon
anywhere
hops
and
booze
are
also
absent
from
the
flavor
profile
flavor
is
not
very
robust
in
similar
fashion
to
the
nose
a
decent
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
complex
and
bold
flavors
this
seems
a
little
washed
out
and
bland
an
introductory
chocolatechilli
beer
a
little
disappointed
am
i
poured
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
an
extremely
dark
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
thick
dense
frothy
milkchocolate
colored
head
that
starts
massively
above
the
beer
but
settles
into
a
solid
inch
and
a
half
good
lacing
along
the
glass
as
the
head
recedes
aromas
are
subtle
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
noted
as
well
as
some
roasted
grain
scents
the
beers
flavors
are
a
little
more
substantial
with
a
round
palate
of
chocolate
and
toasted
cereal
blends
and
a
hint
of
pepper
spicing
the
body
is
light
and
slick
giving
the
flavors
a
short
shelflife
on
the
palate
the
aftertaste
gives
a
bit
more
of
the
chili
pepper
essence
but
only
slightly
with
a
filmy
linger
of
chocolate
as
well
the
finish
is
somewhat
clingy
and
filmy
on
the
palate
and
all
over
the
mouth
clears
away
given
a
little
bit
of
time
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
this
in
terms
of
the
flavor
profiles
but
its
not
bad
bomber
from
total
beverage
wstminster
poured
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
lasting
tan
head
aromas
of
cocoa
cinnamonchilies
light
vanilla
and
light
earthiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
lightly
warming
finish
flavors
of
cocoa
cinnamon
chilies
light
carmel
and
light
vanilla
with
a
smooth
lightly
warming
lingering
cinnamon
finish
a
pretty
interesting
and
balanced
flavor
profile
not
a
huge
fan
of
cinnamon
in
beer
but
i
can
see
why
they
used
it
here
and
it
is
pretty
good
i
hope
sam
adams
releases
more
specialty
bombers
because
the
first
series
was
affordable
and
tasty
o
after
the
first
couple
sips
this
does
tend
to
ease
up
and
become
easier
to
consume
after
the
initial
unique
flavor
shock
though
would
probably
still
be
hesitant
on
ordering
seconds
the
chili
is
held
in
check
compared
to
others
by
style
ive
experienced
and
has
a
bigger
sweeter
caramel
body
then
most
as
well
nice
chocolate
roasted
cocoa
and
chili
mix
provides
for
a
unique
combination
one
you
just
have
to
experience
for
yourself
worthy
of
a
try
drinkability
batch
no
1
eh
nice
initial
effort
for
the
inaugural
small
batch
series
a
fine
nightcap
as
winter
is
definitely
here
with
subzero
wind
chills
bundle
up
drink
a
good
brew
and
stay
warm
cheers
mouthfeel
average
mouthfeel
but
with
a
thick
burning
aftertaste
o
this
has
some
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
smooth
and
it
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
beer
the
chocolate
presence
is
really
nice
but
i
wish
there
would
have
been
some
more
chili
presence
in
the
taste
i
recommend
checking
this
one
out
i
would
try
it
again
overall
a
flop
flavors
are
almost
there
but
fall
short
in
the
long
run
no
depth
and
the
vegetable
aftertaste
is
distracting
at
best
dark
brown
nearly
black
beer
with
a
thin
tan
head
its
an
alluring
beer
a
unique
smell
spice
chocolate
and
chili
in
its
aroma
malt
dark
fruit
cherry
and
robust
roast
coffee
the
flavor
is
also
unique
chocolate
and
malt
with
some
spice
not
as
much
heat
as
i
expected
but
lots
more
flavor
nice
intensity
of
experience
full
in
body
but
i
love
the
smell
this
beer
is
well
worth
a
try
overall
a
good
balance
of
sweet
and
savory
black
bodied
beer
with
a
decent
crop
of
brown
head
lace
is
quite
abundant
aroma
is
light
spice
biscuity
malt
and
dusty
chocolate
flavor
is
very
agreeable
rich
malty
body
with
heavy
but
not
overdone
chocolate
notes
chili
spiciness
is
an
afterthought
and
spicing
is
light
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
this
is
quite
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
overall
pretty
good
better
than
the
other
sam
adams
chocolatey
offerings
ive
had
the
mild
spicy
aftershock
cleanses
the
palate
masks
the
alcohol
and
keeps
it
from
getting
too
heavy
i
have
to
dock
them
points
for
the
brewing
approach
though
adding
cocoa
after
the
fact
makes
me
feel
like
this
a
glorified
maltbased
yoohoo
at
least
they
dont
try
to
hide
it
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
of
liked
more
cinnamon
and
chili
spice
but
i
am
a
guy
who
likes
things
hot
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
good
flavor
and
it
shows
i
like
this
more
than
the
chocolate
bock
in
which
gives
off
a
tart
flavor
this
is
definitely
a
beer
worth
picking
up
and
buying
o
if
you
like
their
chocolate
bock
youll
need
to
try
it
this
beer
also
won
a
medal
at
the
gabf
this
year
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
a
bottle
but
will
pass
on
it
after
this
glass
o
i
wanted
to
like
this
but
really
just
couldnt
to
me
this
was
like
drinking
a
particularly
large
bottle
of
mole
poblano
the
chocolate
and
cinnamon
aromas
and
flavors
are
overpowering
causing
the
caramel
sweetness
i
typically
associate
with
good
bockbiers
to
take
a
backseat
if
you
really
like
chocolate
and
cinnamon
this
may
work
for
you
but
for
me
this
was
just
too
much
the
chili
flavor
would
have
been
more
interesting
if
it
were
pair
with
the
chocolate
instead
this
bock
is
like
a
chocolate
soft
drink
that
leaves
a
mild
burning
in
the
throat
i
thought
this
was
a
barley
wine
when
i
opened
it
not
reading
down
the
label
so
that
was
pretty
amusing
on
first
gulp
usual
wellmade
product
from
bbc
it
is
not
bad
just
overly
spiced
and
a
very
slow
sipper
its
probably
better
with
some
flavorful
food
easy
going
beer
that
in
true
samuel
adams
style
despite
the
brewing
ingredients
remains
a
subtle
beer
worse
even
the
subtlety
gets
lost
after
a
while
end
up
with
a
lightly
chocolate
bock
most
of
all
the
chili
peel
tannins
are
present
throughout
surprisingly
good
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
and
is
a
bit
bigger
than
the
typical
bock
in
flavors
and
strength
d
this
had
a
very
pronounced
chili
flavor
that
mingled
well
with
the
bock
characteristics
nice
scent
and
taste
with
refreshingly
light
body
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
if
this
ages
as
well
as
the
regular
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
it
should
be
a
nice
addition
to
the
cellar
not
super
exciting
fresh
but
a
solid
brew
o
the
aroma
of
this
beer
didnt
do
much
for
me
but
the
flavor
was
quite
nice
i
think
the
chocolate
cocoa
and
roasty
flavors
work
well
with
the
subtle
chili
finish
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
smooth
as
well
its
certainly
worthy
to
be
a
permanent
offering
and
probably
my
favorite
thus
far
in
this
series
of
small
batches
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
seemed
one
of
those
instances
where
the
sum
of
the
parts
might
have
gone
in
a
bit
different
direction
than
anticipated
much
more
stoutlike
than
a
bock
with
the
chocolate
lending
a
significant
density
to
the
flavor
without
a
direct
chocolate
flavor
i
really
did
not
pick
up
much
in
the
way
of
chili
spice
or
flavor
but
there
was
something
that
seemed
to
lend
a
bit
of
brightness
to
the
chocolate
malt
note
or
perhaps
it
was
just
the
power
of
suggestion
o
a
good
beer
that
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
wish
the
chili
peppers
were
more
noticeable
but
still
a
solid
beer
nice
balance
and
8
5
abv
is
very
well
hidden
worth
the
money
definitely
want
to
explore
the
rest
of
this
series
from
sam
adams
22oz
bottle
purchased
at
market
basket
in
portsmouth
batch
1
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
opaque
body
with
slight
brown
highlights
and
less
than
a
half
inch
of
light
tan
head
pepper
and
chocolate
waft
from
the
beer
though
only
lightly
chocolate
cocoa
nibs
spice
and
chili
pepper
comprise
the
flavor
though
the
chocolate
and
spice
definitely
balance
the
flavor
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
the
pepper
becomes
a
bit
more
prominent
as
the
beer
warms
but
the
other
flavors
are
still
enough
to
balance
it
out
unique
and
delightful
drank
some
of
this
at
a
christmas
eve
party
at
my
house
with
my
cousin
my
inlaw
and
myself
we
drank
the
vixen
and
a
rogue
chocolate
stout
side
by
side
we
realized
it
was
2
different
styles
bock
vs
stout
but
it
was
strickly
judged
on
flavor
not
style
presentation
logo
art
or
anything
like
that
just
2
chocolate
flavored
beers
guess
what
we
all
picked
the
the
vixen
over
the
rogue
it
taste
more
like
a
porter
than
a
bock
very
complex
mixture
of
flavors
chocolate
caramel
mild
cinamon
notes
and
faint
roasted
chili
flavorachiote
maybe
the
chocolate
flavor
was
a
smooth
dark
chocolate
not
extreme
bitter
like
the
rogue
again
both
fine
chocolate
beers
that
btw
go
great
with
beef
tamales
and
pasole
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
one
of
these
days
until
then
only
worth
checking
out
if
you
want
a
variation
on
the
chocolate
bock
good
but
the
lack
of
chili
is
mildly
disappointing
still
a
good
offering
from
the
boston
beer
company
pours
dark
almost
black
with
thick
head
probably
the
most
head
ive
ever
seen
on
a
lager
but
eventually
thins
to
a
lace
smells
chocolatey
with
lots
of
alcohol
goes
down
very
thick
and
smooth
with
a
slight
burning
later
in
the
back
of
the
throat
not
sure
if
it
the
chili
or
alcohol
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
ive
never
been
into
chili
beers
much
but
this
one
stands
out
im
very
glad
the
chili
is
so
subtle
ive
only
had
a
couple
chili
beers
but
theyve
been
heavy
handed
i
dont
mind
heat
but
with
beer
its
a
strange
flavor
combo
im
not
into
overall
a
beer
that
id
definitely
try
again
but
would
like
to
with
some
age
to
it
to
see
how
it
tastes
then
despite
the
name
the
chili
is
detectable
but
not
really
spicy
or
anything
its
really
subtle
overall
a
beer
that
i
suppose
you
should
try
if
you
like
more
maltierspelling
beers
dont
expect
much
heat
because
there
is
none
for
a
darker
beer
it
was
good
but
for
the
description
needs
some
updating
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
nice
winter
warmer
certainly
until
that
time
well
worth
trying
overall
drinkability
well
balanced
bold
interesting
and
no
major
flaws
slightly
better
flavor
profiles
and
a
bit
more
complexity
and
this
beer
would
be
pretty
ace
almost
there
sam
overall
damn
why
did
i
put
this
one
in
the
back
of
the
cooler
for
a
week
far
tastier
than
i
expected
very
recommended
bottle
since
there
was
no
born
on
date
or
suggested
freshness
date
i
am
guessing
you
could
age
this
one
nicely
and
try
in
a
year
or
so
to
see
how
the
flavors
develop
this
stuff
is
black
as
night
with
a
very
solid
tan
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
sort
of
metallic
charcoal
malt
pretty
tame
and
nothing
special
the
taste
buds
pick
up
deep
malt
with
sharp
dark
chocolate
charcoal
and
a
slight
citrus
hint
i
dont
pick
up
any
obvious
chili
but
there
may
be
a
slight
edge
in
there
somewhere
it
has
an
unusual
near
minty
quality
its
clearly
full
bodied
with
a
thick
but
managable
feel
carbonation
is
prickly
stuff
that
cuts
the
thickness
adequately
to
make
this
reasonably
drinkable
these
sam
adams
special
brews
are
indeed
special
overall
great
beer
extremely
unique
i
will
definitely
try
to
find
this
one
again
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
is
pretty
drinkable
it
has
pretty
even
feel
and
goes
down
easy
4
99
for
the
bomber
was
a
nice
price
too
split
this
one
with
the
missus
and
paired
it
up
with
some
spicy
pot
roast
as
well
overall
i
really
liked
this
concoction
obviously
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
but
within
the
bockdoppelbock
style
it
holds
its
own
i
may
not
care
to
revisit
this
but
would
definitley
recommend
for
sampling
dark
chestnut
colored
with
ruby
highlights
and
an
oatmeal
colored
head
that
slowly
recedes
aroma
of
cocoa
and
toasty
malt
rich
flavor
of
cocoa
sea
salt
woody
notes
dried
leaves
marshmallow
moderate
offsetting
bitterness
subtle
chili
spice
not
overpowering
would
actually
like
more
complex
flavors
but
just
not
that
thrilling
sort
of
vegetal
not
sure
where
the
saltiness
comes
from
watery
mouthfeel
could
use
more
body
for
my
tastes
o
i
found
the
vixen
to
be
an
interesting
and
unique
beer
the
chocolate
and
chili
flavors
are
wellbalanced
and
provide
a
unique
dimension
to
a
standard
bocktype
beer
other
than
the
latearriving
pepper
clean
aftertaste
slight
bitter
i
did
not
get
any
metallic
notes
others
have
found
ill
buy
a
couple
more
bottles
for
sure
o
very
interesting
beer
diverse
flavor
im
really
enjoying
the
heat
from
the
chili
on
the
finish
good
beer
overall
just
very
different
good
stuff
would
gladly
try
this
one
again
could
easily
session
this
one
too
since
it
strikes
a
nice
balance
with
the
chili
rather
than
being
too
heavy
handed
with
chili
wouldnt
try
this
one
again
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
in
typical
sam
adams
fashion
they
go
halfway
with
it
cool
concept
with
lots
potential
but
still
falls
a
little
flat
side
note
go
pick
up
one
of
sams
new
beer
o
if
youre
a
fan
of
classic
bock
beer
then
dont
try
this
beer
otherwise
its
an
interesting
well
made
brew
a
pour
produces
a
2
finger
light
mocha
colored
head
resting
on
a
very
deep
brown
colored
body
decent
retention
good
lacing
4
b
well
done
samuel
adams
nice
winter
sipper
not
bad
chili
doesnt
really
come
through
o
i
recently
tried
the
chocolate
bock
from
sam
adams
this
beer
has
more
chocolate
flavor
the
hint
of
pepper
doesnt
overwhelm
the
the
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
its
quite
enough
delcious
as
an
americanbrewed
really
double
bock
the
beer
is
delicious
in
its
simplistic
recipe
and
the
layering
of
chocolate
cinnamon
and
chili
peppers
but
the
base
bock
beer
is
limited
because
of
the
use
of
onedimensional
caramel
malts
and
the
under
development
of
malt
character
that
would
have
otherwise
created
the
savory
bread
meaty
and
brine
character
that
make
traditional
german
varieties
so
desirable
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
by
s
a
id
drink
it
all
winter
would
perhaps
try
it
again
otherwise
pretty
darn
good
smooth
chocolatey
sticky
tasting
if
you
like
that
sort
of
dessert
beer
especially
if
you
like
the
sa
choco
bock
original
than
you
will
like
this
o
not
a
huge
fan
had
huge
expectations
but
overall
this
is
worse
than
the
chocolate
bock
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
thick
looking
deep
brown
color
nearly
black
to
me
the
head
was
creamy
looking
with
a
light
tan
color
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
lightly
roasted
with
some
minimal
chocolate
and
malt
aromas
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
i
found
to
be
really
nice
there
is
a
very
subtle
flavor
from
the
chili
in
there
so
faint
that
its
nearly
non
existent
the
chocolate
notes
come
in
to
sweeten
the
beer
a
bit
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
had
a
nice
heavier
body
to
it
with
a
creamy
smooth
feel
to
it
overall
i
found
this
brew
to
be
rather
enjoyable
on
most
levels
the
aroms
was
the
only
weakness
i
think
owould
be
a
lot
better
if
the
spices
were
toned
down
a
lot
still
a
decent
beer
perhaps
with
cellering
this
brew
would
come
forward
and
actually
be
a
chocolate
chili
bock
but
the
one
i
am
consuming
now
misses
that
mark
this
beer
is
a
nice
shift
from
the
standard
sam
adams
brew
the
appearance
is
nice
and
dark
with
a
light
brown
foam
the
pour
is
full
and
the
foam
and
fades
the
smell
gets
more
of
a
chocolate
aroma
as
the
beer
warms
which
is
ok
but
it
is
not
strong
there
are
also
hints
of
malt
in
the
aroma
the
taste
is
good
malty
with
a
chocolate
and
slight
sizzle
of
the
chilis
the
mouthfeel
is
full
maybe
thickish
with
some
carbonation
completing
the
taste
overall
this
beer
is
nice
and
i
believe
it
will
go
over
well
although
for
my
taste
i
would
like
little
less
chocolate
and
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
dark
root
beer
body
and
a
tan
head
light
chocolate
smell
candy
chocolate
smell
where
is
the
chili
on
this
if
it
was
a
chocolate
bock
it
would
be
okay
as
a
chocolate
chile
beer
this
is
way
off
lacks
in
all
departments
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
just
deliver
as
advertised
an
interesting
beer
it
has
an
overabundance
of
chocolate
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
sadly
it
is
lacking
in
the
chili
department
sad
because
you
can
tell
the
beer
had
a
lot
of
potential
hides
the
alcohol
well
not
overly
sweet
i
think
the
beer
would
have
been
better
if
they
had
just
left
the
chilis
out
and
made
a
chocolate
bock
not
a
home
run
but
pretty
tasty
and
balanced
i
guess
its
better
to
err
on
the
side
of
less
chili
drinks
easy
wouldnt
guess
it
was
near
9
percent
interesting
overall
but
after
the
recent
experience
of
stones
11
11
11
vertical
epic
ale
spicy
chili
cravings
left
this
beer
wanting
for
a
bigger
dose
of
heat
which
could
have
even
made
it
a
more
wellrounded
brew
as
it
leans
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
still
in
afterthought
the
combination
of
flavors
is
actually
reminiscent
of
a
peaty
scotch
ale
with
a
similar
weight
and
sweetness
combined
with
that
touch
of
smokiness
in
the
finish
it
seems
that
with
this
beer
the
brewers
at
boston
beer
co
may
have
actually
created
not
a
masterpiece
but
a
hybrid
beer
more
worthy
of
its
own
style
than
the
failed
stylistic
creation
that
is
infinium
o
despite
my
initial
hesitancy
with
the
soy
profile
its
delicious
once
you
get
past
it
great
winter
beer
we
had
it
before
bed
a
few
hours
after
our
thanksgiving
meal
and
it
seemed
appropriate
with
the
chocolate
notes
its
pretty
nontraditional
for
a
bock
o
the
is
chocolaty
and
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
overall
this
beer
in
reality
is
type
sweet
no
it
is
not
like
cherry
wheat
or
any
sam
adams
fruitsweet
inspired
beer
i
have
had
vixen
has
captured
my
heart
pours
gently
and
digests
perfectly
it
is
built
for
dark
beer
flavor
beer
and
real
beer
drinkers
alike
tastes
of
alchol
perfectly
balanced
with
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
chocolate
make
this
a
fn
homerun
cheers
to
all
and
enjoy
overall
i
am
glad
to
buy
this
one
and
it
was
actually
worth
the
money
since
this
was
the
most
balanced
chocolate
chili
beer
i
ever
had
buy
it
overall
i
like
this
one
a
lot
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
the
smell
but
the
taste
made
up
for
it
interesting
balance
of
flavors
and
the
chilis
make
it
a
little
different
o
really
astounded
by
this
brew
loved
the
character
depth
in
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
appearance
was
about
on
par
for
what
i
had
hoped
as
was
the
scent
d
this
beer
doesnt
taste
like
its
8
5
abv
as
i
cant
get
any
alcohol
flavor
at
all
on
the
taste
it
drinks
very
easily
o
while
the
chili
flavor
is
almost
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
rest
of
the
ingredients
are
nicely
integrated
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
bocks
ive
had
although
it
may
not
be
true
to
the
original
style
this
is
3x
better
than
their
chocolate
bock
and
id
love
to
see
this
one
on
the
shelves
as
a
seasonal
if
not
year
round
overall
its
heavier
than
youd
think
for
a
bockand
its
got
big
flavors
i
like
it
a
lotits
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
the
past
few
monthsmaybe
the
best
but
its
a
lot
to
take
in
at
22
ounces
this
bottle
is
plenty
on
its
own
which
is
fine
since
its
got
a
6
pricetag
overall
nice
i
could
do
one
of
these
anytie
good
winter
beer
overall
not
bad
sort
of
a
chili
pepper
spin
on
the
classic
chocolate
bock
a
little
stronger
and
more
malty
then
chocolate
bock
worth
a
drink
if
your
are
a
fan
this
is
the
trend
at
the
momment
and
sammy
adams
did
a
decent
job
paired
excellent
with
the
chili
very
easy
drinking
as
well
the
first
half
was
gone
in
10
mins
and
second
half
went
a
bit
slower
not
incredibly
different
from
their
regular
chocolate
bock
but
the
chili
and
cinnamon
are
well
integrated
definitely
worth
trying
o
overall
very
enjoyable
the
chilies
are
a
bit
subtle
but
i
suppose
that
is
probably
a
good
thing
you
can
certainly
feel
the
spice
a
very
interesting
beer
and
one
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
an
imperial
chocolate
bock
with
spice
this
one
works
in
many
ways
better
but
the
spices
are
not
its
friend
a
very
worthy
beer
no
matter
what
that
dark
beer
drinker
thinks
aroma
of
sweet
chocolaty
malt
color
is
deepest
brown
with
very
full
deep
beige
head
head
lasts
and
laces
the
glass
wonderously
taste
is
absolute
heaven
flavors
of
chocolate
cinnamon
sweet
malt
not
hoppy
chilies
are
more
discerned
by
light
heat
rather
than
anything
else
excellent
warmer
on
a
cold
rainy
night
this
is
my
first
try
of
a
beer
with
chilies
in
it
i
hope
this
is
typical
overall
a
very
nice
beer
o
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
flavors
are
good
im
not
a
fan
of
overly
sweet
beers
but
i
would
drink
one
of
these
every
once
in
a
while
if
shared
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
the
aroma
is
chocolate
light
caramel
spice
and
a
hint
of
pepper
it
has
a
nice
thick
tan
head
that
lasts
a
minute
or
so
before
fading
to
a
thick
film
that
leaves
behind
a
combination
of
webbing
and
rings
for
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
flavor
starts
with
lots
of
milk
chocolate
there
are
some
faint
spicy
notes
in
the
background
the
finish
is
a
mixture
of
caramel
and
light
fruitraisin
with
a
slight
hint
of
smoke
i
did
not
taste
any
spicy
heat
initially
but
about
half
way
through
the
glass
i
did
get
just
a
hint
of
a
spicy
burn
in
the
back
of
my
throat
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
starts
to
lightly
come
through
mediumfull
bodied
with
lightmoderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
sticky
mouthfeel
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
it
wasnt
bad
but
really
a
little
sweet
for
me
and
not
something
i
would
revisit
beer
is
light
in
body
and
has
a
little
bite
to
it
very
nice
a
little
roasty
for
a
bock
but
overall
it
is
nice
dry
finish
decent
bitterness
from
the
chocolate
i
like
it
decent
the
chili
could
even
be
a
bit
more
forward
and
i
would
enjoy
it
perhaps
slightly
more
edit
this
is
one
of
those
situations
where
scoring
doesnt
really
reflect
how
much
i
liked
this
it
seems
pretty
average
based
upon
the
numbers
but
its
quite
tasty
o
another
novelty
bock
much
akin
to
sa
chocolate
bock
this
8
5
abv
flavored
beer
tries
to
do
many
things
but
it
succeeds
at
relatively
few
alone
its
a
bastardized
american
bock
that
carries
some
sweet
satisfaction
however
the
chili
niche
is
lost
on
me
as
well
as
the
intended
flavoring
overall
a
very
nice
beer
overall
its
decent
not
terrible
but
need
alot
of
work
seriously
lacking
the
chili
all
around
overall
not
a
bad
bock
at
all
o
i
would
liked
more
malt
backbone
in
this
o
not
a
bad
effort
better
than
some
ive
had
in
the
latin
stout
category
wouldnt
age
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
especially
for
a
beer
with
this
amount
of
alcohol
i
think
it
works
for
the
delicacy
of
the
flavors
the
drinkability
is
very
good
probably
this
brews
best
aspect
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
went
down
very
easily
i
dont
regret
buying
a
bomber
but
i
probably
wont
buy
another
o
not
bad
but
i
would
expect
a
little
more
chili
to
come
through
o
very
solid
beer
but
not
an
interesting
one
the
label
is
cool
as
hell
though
and
definitely
worth
having
once
talk
about
a
beer
not
living
up
to
its
labeled
promise
not
sure
if
want
to
try
the
other
beers
in
this
new
series
this
tastes
like
an
interesting
experiment
the
chocolate
works
well
but
the
chili
falls
flat
i
probably
wouldnt
mind
but
it
part
of
the
name
of
this
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
o
not
bad
the
biggest
surprises
were
the
lack
of
any
chili
notes
and
the
lightness
of
body
i
detected
the
similar
taste
that
i
get
from
95
of
all
sa
beers
have
that
being
said
the
chocolate
was
definitely
detectable
and
nice
and
the
mf
was
pleasing
overall
when
you
compare
this
to
say
hunaphu
it
gets
ran
over
by
a
bus
the
flavor
could
have
been
so
much
better
but
it
just
falls
tremendously
short
fail
sam
adams
fail
fully
malty
flavor
light
roast
and
milk
chocolate
flavors
a
bare
hint
of
chili
spice
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
unfortunately
on
its
own
its
pretty
good
full
bodied
rich
and
smooth
feel
toffee
chocolate
vegetal
tobacco
and
ancho
sweetness
pretty
easygoing
and
deceptively
smooth
considering
the
higher
abv
pretty
drinkable
and
not
too
spicy
just
enough
of
a
hint
to
make
things
interesting
i
guess
4
5
t
initially
i
was
pissed
since
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
spicy
treat
though
this
didnt
deliver
on
the
heat
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
once
i
got
over
my
expectations
the
nose
is
inexplicably
weak
and
boring
but
the
taste
is
complex
and
well
rounded
and
the
mouthfeel
is
phenomenal
ba
you
were
wrong
overall
not
bad
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
i
wish
the
flavors
stood
out
more
as
well
as
the
nose
o
very
enjoyable
nicely
done
chocolate
bock
i
docked
it
a
half
point
in
the
taste
for
having
such
a
weak
chili
presence
since
thats
included
in
the
name
pours
a
dark
brown
bordering
black
color
off
white
head
aroma
of
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
and
mild
mocha
in
the
taste
full
on
decadent
chocolate
upfront
with
alittle
roasted
malt
flavor
in
the
finish
the
presence
of
chilis
is
noticed
but
not
overstated
mild
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
spice
draws
some
parallels
to
mexican
mole
sauce
and
to
this
would
be
a
fine
pairing
overall
an
interesting
brew
and
worth
the
try
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
nice
dark
brown
with
cream
colored
foam
not
much
lacing
dissipates
quickly
to
a
ring
the
smell
is
sweet
roasty
malt
and
caramel
no
pepper
the
taste
is
caramel
chocolate
dark
malt
and
chili
the
chili
is
towards
the
middle
and
end
very
nice
addition
to
the
flavor
no
spiciness
just
pepper
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
i
like
the
addition
of
the
chili
not
everyone
will
like
it
but
i
do
definitely
worth
a
try
o
nice
effort
from
bbc
and
i
enjoyed
the
beer
id
consider
trying
some
of
the
others
based
on
this
o
overall
this
is
a
great
idea
but
it
falls
short
in
aroma
and
flavor
a
beer
with
this
kind
of
name
should
be
big
and
bold
and
showcase
what
its
all
about
not
really
picking
up
any
chili
peppers
cinnamin
or
cocoa
nibs
which
this
is
claimed
to
be
brewed
with
but
this
is
a
solid
bock
regardless
not
really
something
i
would
buy
again
bocks
really
arent
my
favorite
style
but
its
good
to
see
sam
adams
stepping
up
and
offering
something
for
the
true
beer
geeks
pours
a
deep
black
with
small
tan
head
very
little
lacing
smells
like
a
little
bit
of
roasted
chocolate
with
heat
in
the
back
maybe
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
starts
light
bodied
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
roasted
flavor
a
bit
of
melted
chocolate
sauce
with
medium
bitterness
and
citrus
hops
a
bit
of
a
tingly
finish
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
youd
expect
from
the
nose
easy
drinking
and
quite
nice
probably
ages
well
nose
is
best
feature
of
this
beer
a
nice
infused
chocolatey
character
with
some
miscellaneous
notes
that
tease
for
identification
appearance
wasnt
the
usual
sam
adams
as
the
head
didnt
last
long
at
all
dark
brown
to
light
black
colour
palate
has
a
nice
chocolatey
flavor
with
minimal
chili
presence
good
holiday
beer
o
overall
not
a
bad
bock
but
the
chocolate
dominated
and
the
chili
didnt
live
up
to
its
billing
thats
a
shame
as
there
are
few
greater
flavor
matches
exciting
as
chili
and
chocolate
o
this
is
very
similar
to
the
chocolate
bock
from
the
winter
classics
mix
pack
it
has
increased
strength
which
is
well
integrated
in
the
brew
the
addition
of
chili
is
lost
a
little
bit
i
hoped
for
a
increased
amount
of
heat
rich
aroma
is
malty
with
chocolate
and
yeasty
overtones
and
smoky
and
molasses
notes
it
pours
a
dark
opaque
chocolate
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
malty
flavor
has
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
notes
plus
a
hint
of
caramel
and
a
bit
of
a
kick
from
the
spice
tastes
more
like
a
stout
than
a
bock
smooth
fizzy
texture
has
firm
body
and
leaves
a
chocolaty
and
sassy
finish
vixen
indeed
mo
very
filling
and
good
bock
flavor
with
a
nice
twist
on
the
ingredients
overall
while
i
admit
that
i
wasnt
looking
forward
to
this
beerthere
were
too
many
chances
that
it
could
have
turned
out
an
overpowered
flavor
messim
quite
surprised
at
the
brews
deliciousness
and
drinkability
i
would
have
expected
something
of
this
quality
to
come
from
dogfish
head
so
well
crafted
is
the
brew
and
based
solely
on
the
strengths
of
the
vixen
am
very
much
looking
forward
to
sam
adams
other
offerings
in
this
latest
series
highly
recommended
wtf
are
the
negative
comments
about
in
other
reviews
this
in
the
end
is
beer
first
and
all
the
other
flavors
second
good
balance
and
it
delivers
on
all
flavors
promised
i
really
liked
this
one
and
will
seek
it
out
again
before
it
disappears
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
levels
and
feels
soft
and
slightly
creamy
on
the
palate
overall
a
decent
brew
would
have
like
to
see
a
bit
more
with
the
spices
here
honestly
wasnt
expecting
too
much
hence
not
thatmuch
of
a
disappointment
here
overall
i
liked
the
nose
a
lot
and
the
chili
and
spice
does
come
through
in
the
taste
as
i
assume
they
were
looking
for
this
is
the
second
new
sam
adams
beer
ive
had
now
that
has
had
very
low
carbonation
which
surprised
me
a
huge
step
down
from
new
dipa
1
out
of
2
is
not
bad
so
far
still
two
more
of
these
to
try
do
i
wont
have
any
problem
finishing
the
bomber
for
the
sake
of
research
of
course
but
this
is
one
big
beer
and
the
relatively
high
abv
of
8
5
means
that
i
would
not
be
reaching
for
a
second
one
of
these
overall
this
is
a
big
interesting
challenging
beer
whose
many
tastes
compete
for
your
attention
and
succeeds
in
nearly
every
way
bravo
3
5
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
is
ok
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
chocolate
bready
malt
dark
fruit
molasses
and
a
bit
of
coffee
i
dont
pick
up
any
chilies
in
the
aroma
there
are
some
chilies
noticeable
in
the
taste
along
with
chocolate
dark
fruit
cinnamon
and
caramel
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
with
good
carbonation
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
overall
but
if
youre
expecting
a
lot
of
chilies
in
this
beer
youre
going
to
be
disappointed
but
i
still
think
its
worth
trying
its
not
bad
at
all
the
vixen
is
a
good
chocolate
bock
but
needs
a
little
improvement
in
the
cloying
piquant
flavor
md
sharp
and
a
bit
biting
on
the
palate
not
sour
just
a
strong
acid
profile
roasted
chocolate
malts
balance
this
acid
sufficiently
but
not
enough
to
make
this
beer
particularly
inviting
solid
brew
good
malt
backbone
decent
accent
flavors
and
insane
smoothness
das
this
one
warms
up
it
becomes
a
lot
more
drinkable
theres
a
harsh
bitter
note
at
the
finish
that
really
dissipates
as
it
warms
up
to
room
temperature
drinks
as
a
bland
boozy
bock
i
hope
the
other
two
released
alongside
this
are
better
the
aroma
was
your
classic
malty
bock
nice
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
aromas
mixed
in
with
a
good
earthy
tone
the
flavor
followed
through
very
closely
with
a
nice
bitter
malty
flavor
and
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
in
it
as
well
carbonation
that
is
more
then
decent
never
let
it
go
flat
and
kept
you
entertained
throughout
the
session
i
am
quite
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
as
i
tried
the
griffins
bow
from
this
series
and
just
did
not
like
it
the
only
complaint
i
would
have
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
really
more
like
a
stout
however
i
love
stouts
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
have
been
excellent
i
was
so
intrigued
by
anything
and
everything
chilifused
in
beer
especially
if
its
coupled
with
chocolate
simply
put
this
falls
short
from
what
its
billed
to
be
the
chocolate
and
bock
qualities
are
there
albeit
weak
but
the
chilies
are
missing
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
nothing
special
at
all
overall
if
they
were
going
to
do
a
chili
chocolate
beer
i
wish
they
would
have
committed
to
it
not
bad
but
common
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
chocolate
and
a
spicy
chili
note
in
the
taste
cocoa
sweetness
and
a
nice
mellow
chili
spice
heat
underneath
a
spice
like
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
cocoa
and
hint
of
chili
in
the
aftertaste
i
get
it
mellow
chili
set
off
with
big
chocolate
good
but
just
for
one
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
one
nothing
exciting
right
off
the
pour
and
the
aroma
was
pretty
mild
there
was
a
hint
of
spice
but
really
not
a
ton
more
than
that
nice
and
rich
after
the
first
sip
and
a
little
surprisingly
the
chili
and
chocolate
were
pretty
mild
and
on
the
back
end
still
detectable
but
not
overwhelming
i
wouldve
liked
those
flavors
to
pop
a
little
more
but
still
pretty
good
beer
overall
overall
this
beer
is
a
slow
sipper
but
full
of
flavor
as
a
fan
of
sa
double
bock
this
one
to
me
is
just
as
good
in
a
different
way
i
like
this
one
a
lot
o
impressed
warming
and
full
of
flavor
bbc
created
a
brew
that
i
will
boast
about
and
come
back
to
poured
into
a
5
liter
stein
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
thinner
off
white
head
atop
that
lasted
welldark
fruit
and
light
chocolate
in
the
nosedark
fruit
dominated
with
that
chocolate
being
somewhat
light
sweet
dark
fruit
and
molasses
flavorsthe
chili
is
very
light
in
the
finishit
doesnt
really
play
a
role
its
not
a
bad
bock
but
the
chili
and
chocolate
play
minor
roles
in
the
beer
sam
does
offer
something
interesting
with
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
and
the
heat
works
well
though
a
solid
beer
it
is
not
amazing
which
is
the
normal
complaint
against
sam
the
beer
seems
slightly
off
balance
in
the
amount
of
bitterness
this
does
improve
as
the
beer
warms
and
the
body
seems
a
bit
light
these
flaws
keep
it
from
being
an
amazing
beer
in
my
eyes
however
i
am
not
mad
that
i
spent
the
money
in
this
world
of
rare
limited
and
expensive
brews
it
isnt
such
a
bad
thing
to
find
an
experiment
that
is
solid
rather
than
a
disaster
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
this
again
with
a
year
or
two
of
age
overall
as
always
a
beer
with
a
world
class
mouthfeel
is
going
to
be
treated
kindly
by
me
this
beer
has
great
flavors
deft
use
of
spices
and
a
great
price
since
drinking
it
two
days
ago
ive
bought
more
creamy
mouthfeel
but
a
medium
body
that
seems
light
and
falls
apart
over
the
tongue
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
could
use
a
little
more
punch
o
this
was
a
lot
better
when
the
brought
it
to
the
ebf
not
so
much
now
overall
not
impressed
not
very
much
chili
chocolate
or
bock
going
on
here
o
beer
is
okay
really
wouldnt
buy
it
again
way
to
sweet
to
be
a
good
bock
this
beer
pours
almost
black
with
a
finger
tall
just
off
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
film
little
to
no
lacing
aroma
is
nice
cocoa
forward
with
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
flavor
is
similar
with
a
bit
of
chili
heat
which
complements
the
coco
really
well
a
but
of
sweetness
very
nice
good
carb
and
good
mouthfeel
very
nice
surprise
this
one
sounded
like
the
most
promising
of
the
new
batch
of
sa
bombers
so
hopes
are
high
right
now
it
pours
a
clear
dark
rubybrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
creamtan
foam
dammit
bocks
are
just
a
generally
attractivelooking
style
aint
they
the
nose
comprises
cocoa
light
roasted
malts
very
light
coffee
and
with
some
deep
sniffs
induced
by
the
name
admittedly
some
light
and
very
mild
peppers
the
taste
follows
pretty
closely
though
now
the
pepper
are
a
bit
more
pronounced
theyre
mostly
there
for
flavor
with
very
little
heat
actually
coming
through
imagine
a
very
mild
mole
and
this
would
come
close
to
that
image
the
body
is
a
straight
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
silky
feel
and
a
finish
that
leans
toward
the
dry
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
that
combines
the
chocolate
bock
and
pepper
elements
very
well
good
times
o
a
unique
tasting
bock
thats
worth
a
try
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
a
nice
two
inch
sticky
head
we
have
lacing
i
repeat
tons
of
beautiful
lacing
smell
chocolate
dark
fruits
burnt
coffee
and
a
hint
of
spicy
pepper
taste
is
all
that
just
the
slightest
bit
of
spice
in
the
finish
body
is
big
but
very
approachable
for
the
abv
perfect
carbonation
i
am
so
surprised
how
much
i
like
this
beer
the
only
other
beer
with
peppers
i
have
had
was
rogues
and
not
even
close
to
good
dont
judge
a
book
by
the
cover
very
nice
brew
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
bock
i
liked
the
nose
a
lot
and
the
chili
and
spice
does
come
through
in
the
taste
as
i
assume
they
were
looking
for
this
is
the
second
new
sam
adams
beer
ive
had
now
that
has
had
very
low
carbonation
which
surprised
me
worth
checking
out
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
huge
tan
head
shows
great
retention
and
moderate
lace
smells
mostly
of
chocolate
and
alcohol
with
faint
hints
of
caramel
licorice
and
a
faint
spicy
earthy
tone
i
would
never
guess
form
the
aroma
there
were
chilis
in
here
taste
is
moderately
malty
and
sweet
lots
of
chocolate
and
caramel
flavors
up
front
slight
melanoid
and
toffee
type
flavors
midway
with
a
warming
earthy
spice
that
lingers
long
into
the
finish
medium
to
thick
body
moderate
level
of
carbonation
sweet
sticky
chocolate
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
the
chocolate
is
there
the
bock
is
there
the
peppers
provide
some
nice
flavors
and
subtle
heat
great
job
sam
adams
o
an
interesting
take
on
their
regular
chocolate
bock
the
chilis
dont
come
out
too
much
even
as
it
warms
the
chocolate
is
a
bit
subdued
compared
to
the
regular
though
a
bit
more
mellow
even
with
the
higher
abv
i
like
it
poured
a
2
chocolate
malt
hued
head
with
pretty
good
lasting
power
body
is
dark
as
coffee
smells
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
taste
is
high
on
cocoa
roasted
malts
and
coffee
i
was
surprised
the
chili
was
so
understated
it
sort
of
built
as
a
subtle
burn
the
further
i
got
through
it
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
tasty
dessertstyle
beer
but
i
guess
i
expected
more
chili
since
its
on
the
label
this
beer
reminded
me
of
twizzlers
as
soon
as
i
poured
it
and
even
tasted
it
it
reminded
me
of
the
one
candy
that
i
hated
i
usually
like
every
beer
i
try
and
give
it
at
least
an
average
rating
but
this
beer
just
grossed
me
out
because
it
reminded
me
of
a
licorice
flavor
i
expected
a
more
chocolaty
taste
with
a
bigger
burn
at
the
end
i
would
have
loved
a
stronger
chocolate
taste
and
more
burn
but
no
it
just
gave
me
a
sick
feeling
like
i
just
ate
a
pack
of
licorice
my
buddy
loved
it
i
believe
a
lot
of
people
would
love
it
but
me
myself
i
will
never
buy
it
again
overall
not
bad
light
but
i
wouldnt
expect
sa
to
go
crazy
as
they
have
a
huge
med
taste
fan
base
smooth
and
rich
very
dark
appearance
with
a
thin
tan
laced
head
roasted
malt
cocoa
nibs
with
a
sweet
chocolate
spicey
aftertaste
there
is
a
slight
peppery
warmth
to
it
when
the
beer
is
warmed
and
sitting
for
a
while
you
get
more
of
it
when
it
is
warmer
rather
than
straight
out
of
the
cooler
a
pretty
unique
intriguing
beer
i
love
anything
different
than
the
norm
and
this
was
a
decent
attempt
at
it
like
most
sam
adams
beers
the
taste
and
aroma
are
dead
on
theyre
just
not
strong
enough
i
had
hoped
the
the
small
batch
series
would
be
different
but
i
guess
you
cant
teach
old
brewers
new
tricks
pours
nearblack
with
reddish
highlights
thin
cap
of
khaki
froth
gone
quickly
scent
is
muted
and
gives
off
notes
of
cocoa
powder
roasted
malt
faint
spice
and
faint
dark
fruit
taste
leads
with
a
chocolate
milk
like
taste
faint
woodsy
spicing
and
faint
hint
at
fruit
not
getting
the
chili
beer
is
fuller
side
of
medium
body
smooth
and
uber
dry
like
sucking
on
a
piece
of
lumber
decent
beer
a
touch
dry
and
lacking
in
complexity
o
a
pretty
solid
beer
all
around
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
bomber
at
a
time
though
worth
seeking
out
in
my
opinion
pours
a
onefingered
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
no
lace
black
with
faint
ruby
highlights
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied

chocolate

almost
sweet

cinnamon

bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
wow
very
happy
to
see
this
one
come
from
sam
adams
a
great
interesting
brew
here
this
brew
is
very
good
tasting
full
bodied
and
full
of
great
character
a
great
spin
on
the
style
great
stuff
here
a
decent
bock
appropriate
chocolate
flavor
and
subtle
spice
could
use
a
touch
more
heat
from
the
peppers
poured
into
a
victory
tulip
with
an
average
head
khacki
in
color
that
leaves
a
nice
receding
lacing
on
the
glass
dark
garnet
liquid
with
an
undistinguished
nose
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
with
notes
of
cinnamon
and
bitter
chocolate
the
chili
isnt
really
noticable
at
all
nice
bitter
finish
hoppychocolatey
nice
but
i
expected
just
a
bit
more
from
this
one
o
i
was
a
little
nervous
about
this
beer
the
label
made
it
sound
like
there
was
a
lot
going
on
maybe
too
much
but
damn
this
is
another
surprise
from
sa
i
had
their
dipa
yesterday
and
was
really
impressed
with
that
and
now
another
one
that
just
doesnt
fit
the
sa
blueprint
complex
and
rather
tasty
smooth
and
drinkable
o
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
liked
it
enough
to
grab
a
few
more
bottles
the
next
day
with
hopes
of
making
it
through
the
holidays
this
is
the
most
interesting
and
flavorful
beer
ive
had
from
sam
adams
yet
i
like
it
dont
love
it
the
8
5
isnt
detectable
which
is
good
but
this
is
a
safe
chili
beer
i
love
that
they
are
mixing
things
up
and
this
could
be
great
with
a
bit
more
cocoachili
flavors
to
make
it
stand
out
a
bit
more
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
good
to
see
some
different
stuff
from
sam
adams
definitely
worth
the
pick
up
at
6
recommended
to
chili
beer
fans
or
to
anyone
who
has
a
bad
experience
with
chili
beers
this
one
pulls
it
off
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
the
price
i
really
wish
the
chili
heat
and
the
cocoa
nibs
played
a
bigger
part
though
i
probably
wont
buy
again
but
it
wasnt
a
bad
purchase

good
time
cheers
o
pretty
different
glad
to
see
sam
adams
branching
out
a
bit
more
so
far
the
tasman
is
my
favorite
in
the
bunch
o
most
people
gave
it
such
a
low
score
but
i
actually
find
this
to
be
a
good
chocolate
bock
i
mean
its
not
exceptional
but
definitely
above
average
this
would
be
good
with
some
cake
overall
with
the
exception
of
the
artificial
note
in
the
chocolate
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
great
dessert
beer
and
even
with
it
in
id
still
say
that
it
can
easily
work
as
a
super
chocolatey
and
sweet
dessert
beer
ill
make
a
note
to
myself
this
will
compliment
rather
than
contrast
most
sweet
desserts
and
on
that
note
its
great
as
a
beer
to
drink
however
i
feel
it
fails
miserably
its
onesided
its
overtly
sweet
and
it
has
an
artificial
character
that
distracts
way
to
sweet
for
my
taste
took
about
5
sips
before
dumping
it
out
god
awful
had
this
beer
twice
once
on
tap
and
could
not
drink
it
thought
i
would
try
it
again
in
a
bottle
that
was
given
to
me
drank
about
a
quarter
of
it
and
again
had
to
dump
it
way
to
much
chocolate
for
my
taste
so
much
artificial
flavor
its
ridiculous
if
you
are
looking
to
replace
chocolate
milk
drink
this
a
lot
of
artificial
flavors
overall
this
is
not
a
complex
beer
but
it
is
very
sweet
and
chocolate
lovers
will
appreciate
it
try
it
just
to
find
out
what
it
is
like
to
drink
liquid
chocolate
great
if
you
are
looking
for
something
sweet
tastes
like
imitation
chocolate
extract
sadly
i
bought
a
bottle
before
i
tasted
it
on
tap
i
never
give
beers
back
to
the
bartender
but
he
got
this
one
back
terrible
delivers
on
the
chocolate
kind
of
thick
though
id
drink
it
again
o
an
enjoyable
beer
for
one
gets
crazy
cloying
sweet
put
in
a
lot
more
malt
throw
it
on
nitro
and
it
would
be
dynamite
sweet
mess
of
a
beer
way
too
sweet
i
am
only
assuming
used
cheap
flavorings
and
too
much
of
them
only
could
handle
half
a
beer
before
pouring
it
out
this
is
not
a
typical
bock
by
any
means
but
it
does
offer
a
rich
chocolaty
aroma
and
flavor
which
i
enjoyed
it
was
definitely
a
dessert
beer
an
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
more
than
one
at
a
time
overall
it
was
a
nice
drinking
experience
tastes
like
a
super
sweet
milk
chocolate
hersheys
kiss
not
my
thing
this
beer
is
terrible
i
would
buy
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stour
i
bought
this
because
the
guy
in
the
store
told
me
it
was
better
than
brooklyn
not
even
close
this
has
a
fake
chocolate
taste
that
is
disgusting
this
is
very
chocolatey
and
if
you
like
that
then
this
will
be
very
good
to
you
very
tasty
dessert
beverage
poured
a
dark
caramel
color
with
a
hazelnut
head
aroma
is
overwhelmingly
sweet
with
artificial
chocolate
notes
taste
is
overly
sweet
and
artificial
like
tootsie
roll
or
chocolateflavored
licorice
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
syrupy
this
beer
bottle
says
malt
beverage
was
so
bad
i
poured
it
out
this
one
is
way
off
this
is
from
pittsburgh
brewing
it
is
damn
good
beer
not
penn
brewery
please
pay
attention
to
the
bs
you
are
posting
overall
if
there
was
a
good
base
bock
underneath
the
artificial
chocolate
flavoring
i
might
be
able
to
hang
with
this
im
not
a
fan
pretty
good
i
little
heavy
and
artificial
on
the
flavoring
not
on
par
with
youngs
or
even
brooklyn
but
an
ok
sipping
beer
had
a
generous
sample
of
this
from
my
wifes
pint
at
our
local
pourhouse
very
chocolatey
quite
sweet
both
agreed
that
it
would
be
an
excellent
dessert
beer
as
in
with
some
actual
dessert
consumption
i
wouldnt
drink
a
whole
pint
not
my
cup
etc
however
it
is
what
they
said
it
is
and
that
is
okay
in
my
book
overall
much
better
than
their
pumpkin
ale
they
make
which
was
pretty
much
pure
candied
cinnamon
no
pumpkin
this
beer
to
me
reminds
me
of
a
blend
of
youngs
chocolate
stout
and
the
body
of
samuel
adams
chocolate
bock
dont
drink
it
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beers
thanks
to
hopface
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
deep
mahogany
hue
with
a
translucent
clarity
and
a
loose
18th
inch
tancolored
head
that
quickly
disperses
towards
the
edges
big
dark
chocolate
notes
on
the
nose
followed
by
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
theres
a
distinct
cloyingly
sweet
artificial
sweetener
character
that
really
asserts
itself
and
lingers
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
overall
not
a
good
beer
cloyingly
sweet
and
not
in
a
good
way
i
may
not
be
able
to
finish
this
one
the
original
review
gets
reduced
a
bit
because
i
was
rating
it
as
a
stout
not
a
bock
as
it
should
have
been
on
the
dry
hoppy
side
of
bocks
and
im
not
complaining
sweetness
is
restrained
in
favor
of
nutty
toasty
salty
malts
soft
fizz
super
clean
finish
and
at
this
strength
the
abv
is
still
somehow
not
overplayed
yum
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
sweeter
taste
than
for
a
normal
german
beer
with
some
bock
feeling
at
the
end
not
bad
try
it
when
you
see
it
theres
alot
going
on
here
but
it

up
being

cacophony
of

which
just
doesnt
bring
much
harmony
or
joy
drinkable
but
the
sour
fruit
finish
might
annoy
some
and
the
body
is
a
little
too
light
to
be
considered
a
standard
good
beer
dr
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
abv
well
priced

a
great
beer
all
around
nicely
balanced
bock
here
doesnt
make
me
want
to
go
out
and
grab
a
case
but
its
tasty
and
drinkable
edit
i
guess
this
isnt
from
the
kulmbacher
brewery
although
from
kumlbach
and
billed
as
the
popular
beer
from
kulmbach
it
is
disassociated
d
a
very
good
bock
well
done

a

i

before
it

the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
like
the
brew
prosit
mk
i
was
very
dissapointed
with
this
beer
to
be
honest
obviuosly
a
supermarketnightshop
sort
of
beer
in
my
opinion
not
a
well
crafted
beer
at
all
overall
this
beer
is
bordering
on
doppelbock
character
more
so
than
a
typical
bock
beer
the
body
is
maybe
in
millimeter
from
being
full
enough
to
be
a
doppelbock
and
a
little
hoppier
but
i
think
it
would
be
splitting
hairs
i
couldnt
polish
off
more
than
one
half
liter
of
this
but
its
quite
good
md
even
better
than
paulaner
salvator
this
doublebock
shows
an
evendeeper
input
of
toasted
malts
that
is
in
turn
balanced
by
a
lovely
sour
fruity
edge
the
carbonation
comes
nearly
perfect
as
soothing
as
refreshing
all
in
all
this
malty
brew
is
utterly
enjoyable
and
even
quaffable
by
the
german
bock
standard
this
beer
is
best
for
special
introspective
evenings
and
a
damned
good
price
too
this
is
decent
drinking
and
should
please
bock
fans
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
that
would
pair
wonderfully
with
a
hearty
meal
or
a
cigar
and
a
fireplace

and

its
packed
full
of

flavors
of

raisins
and
vanilla
up

with
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
full

tasty
as

and
highly
drinkable
its
damn
good
dthis
beer
had
2
months
before
expiration
date
perhaps
a
slightly
stale
flavouring
im
sure
a
fresh
tap
glass
would
be
a
bit
more
lively
but
as
a
typical
bock
beer
this
is
very
good
not
too
syrupy
and
with
alchohol
well
disguised
its
easy
to
drink
too
much
of
this
taste
is
green
malty
but
still
strong
on
the
malt
presence
on
top
of
the
malt
base
there
is
a
mild
caramel
taste
the
vegetable
taste
is
in
the
taste
but
i
get
used
to
this
after
some
sips
and
i
do
not
taste
it
anymore
the
yeast
gives
some
anise
notes
body
was
medium
not
overly
sweet
the
beer
had
good
clarity
and
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
massively
poofed
head
served
in
an
enormous
1l
mug
the
smell
was
sweet
and
malty
it
reminded
me
of
the
wort
aroma
you
can
smell
in
breweries
nice
and
inviting
the
taste
was
mostly
malt
i
didnt
get
much
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
as
i
normally
see
from
the
bocks
available
to
me
in
the
us
mostly
from

was

theres

what

going

to

the
aftertaste
is

sweet
this
is
a
nice

not

like

probably
should
be

overall
sign
me
up
for
more
this
bock
rocks
overall
excellent
i
think
this
is
schells
best
offering
except
for
the
sadly
departed
emerald
rye
there
arent
a
lot
of
quality
american
bocks
that
i
have
access
to
but
this
will
do
nicely
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
as
much
as
i
look
forward
to
just
about
any
other
beer
not
too
strong
but
sortof
an
all
day
sipper
drinking
bock
this
was
definitely
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
pours
a
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
good
finger
of
a
offwhite
head
that
settles
back
down
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
caramel
for
the
most
part
the
taste
has
even
more
going
on
with
the
sweet
caramel
malts
coming
together
nicely
with
a
hint
of
spice
goes
down
very
easy
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
perfect
carbonation
a
great
brew
this
is
pretty
nice
its
very
toastedmaltforward
and
i
like
that
slight
hop
spice
and
not
too
sweet
and
of
course
it
has
that
velvety
smooth
german
lager
mouthfeel
a
decent
tasting
bock
maybe
just
a
tad
on
the
wettish
lighter
feel
but
definitely
worth
drinking
another
solid
schells
beer
notes
very
nice
bock
that
grew
on
me
as
i
sipped
it
the
flavors
balance
each
other
out
quite
nicely
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
nice
and
enjoyable
while
being
simple
and
easy
to
drink
leisurely
worth
a
shot
o
not
a
bad
bock
at
all
could
really
get
into
this
come
autumn
cheers
aaron
oa
nice
example
of
a
bock
except
sweeter
than
most
a
superior
example
of
the
style
well
crafted
flavorful
and
balanced
overall
a
very
solid
beer
good
for
the
season
i
think
ill
have
another
summation
a
decent
mn
variant
of
bock
style
beer
not
anything
over
the
top
but
yet
satisfactory
for
its
price
and
purpose
perfect
for
when
you
have
that
bock
craving
comes
in
12
packs
during
the
spring
o
a
nice
mellow
bock
that
almost
feels
like
a
nut
brown
o
schell
pretty
much
nails
the
style
with
this
beer
no
roastiness
or
overlybitter
hopping
just
rich
munich
andor
vienna
malts
the
only
thing
that
stops
me
from
all
5s
might
be
the
bitterdry
character
in
the
aftertaste
this
keeps
the
beer
from
being
as
clean
as
it
might
be
and
a
better
lager
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
example
of
the
traditional
bock
style
this
beer
wont
disappoint
m
smooth
medium
bodied
with
a
hint
of
oiliness
but
carbonated
just
well
enough
to
counter
balance
it
still
it
could
have
used
a
slightly
higher
level
of
carbonation
to
lighten
it
up
a
bit
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
bodied
with
slightly
below
mediumlevel
carbonation
resultant
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
somewhat
crisp
generally
smooth
flowing
the
lower
carbonation
actually
fits
this
beer
as
it
is
something
to
roll
around
on
the
palate
and
not
drink
quickly
o
this
is
such
a
nice
american
version
of
the
german
style
true
to
style
and
so
malty
and
warming
and
tastybring
on
spring
the
aroma
was
your
classic
malty
bock
nice
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
aromas
mixed
in
with
a
good
earthy
tone
the
flavor
followed
through
very
closely
with
a
nice
bitter
malty
flavor
and
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
in
it
as
well
carbonation
that
is
more
then
decent
never
let
it
go
flat
and
kept
you
entertained
throughout
the
session
overall
one
thing
schell
has
going
for
itself
is
the
ability
to
master
the
mouthfeel
the
level
of
carbonation
couldnt
get
any
better
it
perfectly
reveals
the
flavor
of
the
beer
and
allows
for
a
great
glass
anytime
o
a
pretty
good
american
made
bock
enjoyable
and
worth
trying
o
really
liked
it
i
usually
pass
over
schell
but
i
threw
this
one
in
a
mixer
glad
i
did
skål
nice
white
head
decent
earthy
hop
smell
watery
but
smooth
malt
profile
nice
carbonation
hides
the
alcohol
well
tangy
yet
sweet
brings
a
complexity
that
isnt
in
the
standard
bock
solid
beer
overall
great
for
the
price
enjoy
overall
a
pretty
decent
bock
mouthfeel
os
well
balanced
could
benefit
from
an
even
lower
abv
to
make
this
good
beer
truly
sessionable
ihad
this
at
bockfeast
in
new
ulm
pours
amber
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
dissipates
fast
aroma
is
sweet

malty
as
expected
from
a
d
bock
caramel
with
a
light
undertone
of
hops
some
roast
in
the
aroma
as
well
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
with
a
slight
bitterness
which
offsets
the
sweet
malt
profile
nicely
very
drinkable
sessionable
at
that
i
enjoy
the
nice
hop
bite
on
the
finish
good
goes
down
easy
but
i
find
this
one
to
be
relatively
blah
its
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
and
lacks
the
malt
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
its
also
not
tasty
enough
to
be
an
easydrinking
sessionable
bock
not
bad
but
falls
flat
in
my
opinion
d
a
fine
bock
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
beer
is
a
reason
why
definitely
not
the
best
bock
ive
had
but
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
i
will
look
forward
to
this
every
year
d
classic
bock
for
the
style
i
would
consider
a
5
but
my
vote
here
is
only
4
just
because
this
beer
is
a
little
unnuancedbasic
nice
beer
though
i
cant
recall
ever
liking
schells
bock
this
much
next
up
lets
see
some
magic
done
on
the
doppelbock
d
worth
it
if
enjoyed
it
cannot
be
drunk
fast
and
with
vigor
notes
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
one
again
nothing
terribly
great
and
i
didnt
think
they
did
a
great
job
on
this
one
try
this
bock
if
you
havent
already
and
then
thank
herman
the
german
for
new
ulm
and
the
great
schell
brewery
md
medium
bodied
sweet
caramel
taste
with
a
slight
citrus
aftertaste
a
really
great
tasting
bock
a
really
good
mix
of
sweetness
and
malts
another
must
try
from
schells
i
recommend
you
try
this
brew
if
you
can
still
find
it
good
beer
from
a
good
old
americangerman
brewery
drinkability
low
a
few
sips
of
this
stuff
and
i
feel
full
and
my
mouth
feels
saturated
with
unwanted
sweet
d
easy
drinking
abv
is
potent
but
manageable
moderately
filling
due
to
its
carbonation
flavors
are
light
not
overwhelming
seems
sessionable
drinkability
fantastic
bock
that
even
rivals
many
doppelbocks
in
terms
of
its
malty
punch
one
of
the
very
few
germanstyle
bocks
around
with
its
pure
barley
malts
no
wheat
adjuncts
or
spices
and
its
original
gravity
of
16
nice
bock
pleasantly
surprised
d
this
is
a
pretty
nice
bock
yet
another
good
germanstyle
brew
from
august
schell
the
aroma
has
nice
caramel
and
toffee
tones
some
toasty
and
faint
hoppy
notes
too
taste
is
similarly
centered
on
sweet
malt
caramel
toffee
some
toastiness
some
hops
the
body
is
medium
full
good
carbonation
and
it
dries
up
toward
the
end
in
all
an
enjoyable
enough
beer
to
drink
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
the
great
ones
but
is
quite
drinkable
nonetheless
conclusion
simple
tasty
awesome
bock
better
than
the
caramel
bock
it
replaced
for
sure
drinks
easy
a
pretty
nice
bock
hides
the
abv
fairly
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
other
than
the
flat
appearance
good
flavor
profile
with
plenty
going
on
god
damn
schells
is
awesome
i
need
this
brewery
to
start
distributing
here
asap
so
far
the
only
american
brewery
that
i
feel
can
consistently
make
every
german
style
up
to
german
standards
try
this
for
sure
overall
good
drinkability
good
roasted
flavors
the
smell
is
much
sweeter
than
the
flavor
nice
representation
of
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
very
sessionable
thanks
again
to
br3wmeister
for
a
chance
to
enjoy
this
minnesota
brew
this
bock
has
a
rich
caramel
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
tan
head
has
a
toasty
and
nutty
character
to
the
aroma
it
is
full
of
caramel
and
grains
it
has
a
slight
floral
hop
finish
smooth
and
clean
feel
to
it
and
it
really
goes
down
good
i
am
impressed
by
this
beer
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
from
a
local
brewer
i
would
have
again
pours
out
a
clear
dark
mahoghany
colour
with
a
thin
and
sticky
light
tan
head
wisps
of
lace
sweet
malty
aroma
a
hint
of
fruitcake
and
molassees
taste
is
all
malty
goodness
not
sweet
at
all
some
burnt
sugar
and
rum
notes
with
a
ghostly
ripe
red
fruitiness
it
has
some
bittering
for
balance
so
the
hopping
never
interferes
with
the
straight
laced
malts
no
alcohol
detected
tastes
solid
and
malty
like
a
good
bock
should
the
body
is
balanced
and
full
for
the
style
with
a
crisp
and
semi
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
outstanding
because
it
has
a
refreshing
quality
with
a
degree
of
flavourfulness
that
balances
nicely
solid
beer
and
recommended
to
try
if
you
get
the
chance
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
recommend
this
highly
looks
the
part
perfectly
clear
rich
mahogany
tone
sets
the
pace
thin
beige
head
leaves
moderate
amounts
of
lace
as
i
drink
decent
aroma
of
some
caramel
malty
goodness
with
a
little
molasses
sprinkled
into
the
nose
flavor
base
is
solid
fairly
rich
with
the
malt
pretty
clean
malty
without
being
sweet
hops
only
serve
to
provide
balance
which
is
good
this
is
definitely
good
not
great
but
good
head
to
head
against
new
glarus
bock
this
would
not
compare
but
hey
that
beer
is
out
of
their
rotation
now
so
this
one
will
definitely
do
if
im
craving
bock
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
am
not
the
biggest
bock
fan
but
this
one
has
heavily
impressed
me
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
flavor
and
just
a
great
overall
value
i
highly
recommend
done
of
the
best
new
beers
if
not
the
best
to
hit
the
shelves
from
a
minnesota
brewer
this
year
definitely
not
the
same
as
this
years
snowstorm
that
was
awesome
too
but
had
a
much
different
overall
flavor
this
is
as
true
of
a
bock
as
ive
had
in
awhile
so
many
breweries
label
any
dark
lager
a
bock
when
it
isnt
this
is
a
true
bock
and
dare
i
say
a
minnesota
classic
best
regional
bock
i
have
had
new
glarus
is
close
but
this
takes
top
prize
im
pumped
about
this
new
beer
d
pretty
decent
ill
prolly
drink
a
lot
of
these
this
spring
for
the
price
and
the
smooth
regular
taste
pours
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
nice
caramel
notes
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
nice
caramel
touch
medium
body
drinkable
a
nice
brew
drinkability
is
high
great
flavors
on
this
bock
and
definitely
easy
to
consume
id
be
willing
to
keep
this
around
in
6
packs
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
large
tan
head
that
has
excellant
retention
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
strong
caramel
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
maybe
nuts
starts
off
with
a
sweet
flavor
of
caramel
but
there
is
a
nice
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
flavor
has
a
nice
dry
finish
i
think
this
is
even
better
than
snowstorm
08
medium
body
but
it
seems
to
be
a
touch
overcarbonated
this
is
a
nice
bock
and
a
big
improvement
over
the
old
caramel
bock
one
of
the
best
bocks
out
there
today
august
schell
bock
pours
a
big
tan

over
a
deep
ambercoffee
colored
brew
active
carbonation
lots
of
little
bubbles
nose
is
clean
toasty
malts
pretzel
maybe
and
lager
yeast
the
flavor
is
very
much
like
i
remember
their
08
snowstorm
wasis
like
dark
toasty
malts
and
an
herbal
hop
off
the
back
maybe
dialed
back
a
bit
not
so
much
rye
as
i
remember
hop
a
tad
more
aggressive
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
finishing
dry
dry
dry
nice
this
is
about
as
fast
as
schells
moved
one
of
their
snowstorms
into
regular
yearround
production
as
of
this
writing
february
09
both
snowstorm
and
the
new
bock
are
both
in
the
shops
the
only
downside
is
the
new
bock
replaces
their
caramel
bock
which
i
was
quite
fond
of
but
by
all
means
take
the
opportunity
to
compare
em
for
yourself
theres
some
good
solid
stuff
here
d
big
time
i
can
empty
a
few
of
these
one
of
the
most
solid
bocks
i
have
had
nice
man
i
wish
i
had
another
snowstorm
2008
to
do
a
side
by
side
this
is
a
great
bock
with
great
complexity
but
still
extremely
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pours
amber
brown
with
an
off
white
head
that
dissipates
fast
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
as
expected
from
a
d
bock
caramel
with
a
light
undertone
of
hops
some
roast
in
the
aroma
as
well
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
with
a
slight
bitterness
which
offsets
the
sweet
malt
profile
nicely
very
drinkable
sessionable
at
that
i
enjoy
the
nice
hop
bite
on
the
finish
good
dnice
drinkability
as
a
new
addition
to
the
schells
lineup
i
think
this
will
be
a
success
its
got
some
nice
bock
characteristics
and
it
really
left
me
wanting
another
one
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
bock
i
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
drinkability
is
excellent
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
i
really
missed
this
beer
glad
they
brought
it
back
for
how
long
im
not
sure
so
i
guess
ill
stock
up
the
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
ruby
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
quarter
inch
cap
of
foam
lacing
is
thorough
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
toasty
malt
and
hints
of
spicy
noble
hops
the
taste
is
full
of
malt
lots
of
toasty
roasted
malt
caramel
and
what
seems
like
the
most
hops
ive
ever
tasted
in
a
bock
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
by
no
means
a
hoppy
beer
but
the
hops
are
definitely
detectable
which
is
odd
in
a
bock
it
works
here
though
and
really
gives
the
beer
a
character
all
of
its
own
the
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
it
makes
me
wonder
if
oats
are
involved
carbonation
is
quite
low
overall
this
is
one
fine
bock
that
im
sure
will
become
a
seasonal
regularity
for
me
and
it
sure
knocks
the
pants
of
caramel
bock
it
is
great
to
see
the
continued
improvement
in
schells
beers
that
has
been
happening
over
the
past
couple
years
bravo
to
the
brewers
and
brewery
for
two
exceptional
very
well
done
malty
complex
lagers
what
a
fantastic
special
beer
light
bock
flavors
sweet
cream
and
hints
of
licorice
abound
in
a
german
way
got
to
add
this
to
the
christmas
beer
wishlist
on
a
regular
basis
from
now
on
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
semisweet
with
a
lot
of
great
malt
and
bread
scents
coming
through
with
some
light
citrus
the
taste
was
nice
with
a
thick
amount
of
malt
in
the
beginning
which
trails
off
into
light
orange
peel
for
a
pleasant
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
likely
have
it
again
not
that
its
not
good
its
just
you
know
like
candy
canes
great
when
you
have
one
not
so
bad
when
you
dont
in
the
not
so
bad
but
bad
enough
for
once
a
year
family
member
category
make
sense
pours
a
hazy
golden
body
with
average
retention
and
almost
no
lacing
kind
of
boring
aroma
is
brown
bread
and
flavor
expands
on
that
with
spices
that
grow
in
intensity
as
it
warms
smooth
and
chewy
its
decent
enough
just
needs
to
work
on
its
appearance
nice
flavor
slight
hop
bite
maltiness
cracker
like
bready
quite
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
great
not
too
thin
and
not
too
chewy
a
decent
beer
got
this
on
sale
at
total
wine
for
1
99
totally
worth
it
just
not
very
pleasant
to
drink
artificial
sweet
malts
and
paper
tastes
doesnt
really
resemble
a
bock
especially
after
enjoying
weissenohe
monks
christkindl
recently
this
seems
like
a
disgrace
to
the
style
and
kinda
to
beer
in
general
overall
an
exceptional
brew
not
an
entirely
complex
beer
but
for
the
style
this
is
something
id
endeavor
to
find
out
of
the
tap
in
a
nice
dark
warm
ambience
pours
a
very
clear
pale
nearly
amber
in
color
aroma
is
clean
and
nutty
some
hint
of
barley
grist
flavor
is
clean
like
a
pilsner
and
turns
thicker
with
some
smoke
and
umami
coppery
aftertaste
with
some
fruity
nectary
hops
feel
is
more
watery
than
anything
with
medium
carbonation
but
tending
towards
flat
finish
is
somewhat
sweet
but
mostly
balanced
this
is
nothing
special
im
not
one
for
bocks
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
bock
or
a
pilsner
not
bad
but
not
good
either
o
as
a
christmas
beer
i
feel
lack
of
spice
was
really
a
downer
a
good
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
but
not
a
christmas
miracle
a
solid
offering
none
the
less
it
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
fades
fast
it
smells
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
yeast
the
taste
starts
malty
yeasty
and
sweet
and
then
delicately
fades
into
a
mildly
bitter
hop
finish
the
malt
and
yeast
never
really
give
up
their
grasp
on
your
tongue
though
in
fact
the
malt
and
yeast
can
be
tasted
long
after
the
hops
have
faded
from
the
palate
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
but
the
thickcreamy
mouthfeel
counteracts
it
beautifully
this
beer
was
a
new
experience
for
me
i
usually
target
hop
forward
beers
that
are
intensely
bitter
but
this
one
was
a
bit
different
thoroughly
enjoyable
but
completely
out
of
my
normal
beer
style
a
nice
enough
beer
overall
a
tasty
winter
bock
light
and
enjoyable
i
will
put
thisup
for
review
again
perhaps
its
a
misrepresentation
overall
a
no
frills
solid
bock
that
will
warm
you
on
a
cold
night
poured
into
a
large
brandy
snifter
pours
clear
caramel
brown
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
very
long
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
visible
bubbles
rising
in
the
beer
the
aroma
is
sweet
like
caramel
with
some
chocolate
and
bread
the
hops
are
a
little
grassy
and
mildly
spicy
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
biscuit
like
with
sweet
caramel
the
hops
are
grassy
and
spicy
providing
some
nice
flavor
and
some
back
end
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
this
is
an
excellent
beer
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
flashes
of
sweetness
through
the
flavoring
otherwise
they
really
missed
the
stylistic
mark
here
off
the
bat
the
coloring
was
far
too
light
while
the
nose
gave
an
overly
sweet
crazily
adjuncty
grain
bill
there
was
little
depth
or
roast
to
support
it
the
flavor
ran
into
the
same
problems
with
nothing
robust
enough
to
drive
the
beer
home
16
9oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
darker
clear
caramel
color
there
was
a
very
small
tan
head
that
didnt
linger
long
or
leave
any
lacing
the
aroma
is
ok
caramel
malts
hints
of
biscuit
subtle
fruits
some
earthy
hops
and
maybe
a
hint
of
spices
the
taste
is
ok
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
spices
mild
earthy
hops
maybe
a
hint
of
breadiness
decent
enough
but
im
glad
it
was
on
sale
dont
think
it
was
worth
the
original
5
99bottle
overall
quite
a
hoppy
bock
that
has
some
christmas
spicing
might
not
get
it
again
but
it
was
worth
a
try
a
somewhat
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
intense
aroma
of
cider
apple
juice
and
cardboard
there
is
a
touch
of
spice
to
it
and
a
strong
sweetness
the
flavor
is
no
better
lots
of
cardboard
and
paper
with
a
green
apple
flavor
a
touch
of
cider
and
sugar
not
really
even
much
in
the
way
of
malt
flavor
to
be
found
here
thin
and
watery
to
boot
o
typically
bocks
are
much
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
you
can
tell
that
this
one
is
crafted
very
well
and
the
touch
of
hop
doesnt
make
is
so
one
dimensional
good
beer
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
more
but
it
seems
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
of
things
i
would
expect
a
bit
more
smoothness
for
a
lagerbock
decent
probably
okay
for
the
style
but
not
something
to
get
real
excited
about
interesting
blend
but
a
bit
thicker
than
most
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
1
inch
puffy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
back
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
grape
like
fruity
aromas
there
is
also
a
slight
metallic
aroma
on
this
one
taste
is
very
much
the
same
even
down
to
the
metallic
flavor
there
is
a
medium
astringent
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
was
expecting
something
much
different
a
nice
traditional
german
bock
definitely
tastes
like
an
amped
up
version
of
a
munich
lager
overall
a
very
good
brew
interesting
to
taste
and
think
about
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
nice
medium
mouth
feel
and
carbination
makes
this
a
very
easy
drinker
for
me
this
is
spot
on
as
far
as
style
description
goes
and
would
be
an
easy
brew
to
have
in
the
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
an
a
bock
in
my
book
i
could
see
making
this
a
christmas
tradition
well
rounded
and
flavorful
overall
a
strong
and
hardy
christmas
lager
perfect
for
a
holiday
afternoon
relaxing
by
the
fire
this
bock
is
simple
yet
excellent
a
prime
example
of
german
brewing
excellence
and
why
sometimes
less
is
more
strong
aroma
has
malty
caramel
molasses
yeast
and
cloves
notes
very
appealing
it
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
typical
ivory
head
flavor
has
fruity
malty
and
earth
notes
as
well
as
a
hint
of
cloves
texture
is
smooth
averagebodied
and
just
a
bit
slimy
with
minimum
fizz
merry
whateveryoucelebratethistimeofyear
mahrs
christmas
bock
is
very
drinkable
and
i
was
surprised
by
the
low
abv
however
it
isnt
a
terribly
complex
or
interesting
beer
though
a
pleasant
beer
to
accompany
a
meal
it
isnt
really
worth
seeking
out
taste
begins
with
a
nice
malty
flavor
along
with
noble
hops
this
quickly
fades
though
into
a
bitter
cough
syrup
flavor
the
bitterness
continues
and
becomes
quite
harsh
im
not
sure
if
its
the
age
of
this
beer
or
just
the
way
it
is
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
highly
drinkable
brew
tasty
with
enough
complexity
to
be
a
fine
beverage
for
the
winter
months
overall
not
bad
most
of
the
mahrs
beers
are
phenomenal
this
is
good
but
not
at
usual
standards
for
them
imo
but
still
decent
and
drinkable
label
says
bottled
on
701u
well
thats
useful
it
might
be
a
little
old
the
beer
poured
with
hardly
any
carbonation
and
only
the
smallest
bit
of
foam
the
aroma
is
decent
dominated
by
a
nice
toastedbreadcrust
malt
rich
and
sweet
flavor
though
is
disappointing
its
malty
but
its
harsh
and
sweet
without
any
normal
munich
subtleness
bitterness
is
restrained
yeast
character
neutral
just
not
a
very
interesting
beer
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
pretty
good
head
on
it
the
lacing
was
decent
but
not
great
the
smell
of
the
see
doesnt
really
shout
christmas
at
me
the
aromas
do
have
some
fruity
grains
on
the
nose
though
the
taste
has
bready
and
lightly
fruity
flavors
going
on
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
not
really
a
holiday
beer
in
my
opinion
but
still
nice
to
try
an
alright
bock
would
try
it
again
if
i
knew
i
was
getting
a
fresh
sample
this
is
a
good
tasty
bock
beer
nice
example
of
the
style
with
a
little
winter
twist
mixed
in
o
ive
changed
my
mind
a
bit
on
this
brew
and
now
find
it
to
be
very
refreshing
almost
beautiful
lager
but
it
lacks
a
christmas
feel
the
aroma
consists
of
a
touch
of
caramel
some
nutty
munich
malty
sweetness
there
is
a
classic
german
lager
yeast
character
to
both
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
in
the
flavor
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
combines
with
the
nutty
malts
from
the
aroma
this
is
really
a
solid
example
of
a
bock
and
since
this
had
about
a
year
on
it
at
the
time
of
consumption
perhaps
this
could
hold
up
well
and
continue
to
improve
this
is
just
awesome
id
pick
up
a
lot
more
of
this
as
it
is
perfectly
textured
and
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
bamberger
hits
the
mark
on
this
one
if
ever
in
bamberg
check
out
the
mahrs

built
in

there
is
no
better
place
to
drink

i
find
everything
about
this
beer
spoton
and
could
far
too
easily
drink
it
by
the
liter
morning
noon
or
night
good
enough
to
enjoy

ill
always

a

spot
for

which
i
first
tried
after
it
was
gifted
to
me
on
christmas
eve
and
which
spurred
my
journey
into
craft

in

sense
may
be
the
greatest
gift
ive
ever
received

you
have
any

drinkers

youd
like
to
see
get
into

beer
give
them
the
gift
of
a

not
really
a
lot
to
this
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
style
many
people
have
already
said
it
but
it
doesnt
hurt
to
reiteratetheres
nothing
christmasy
about
this
one
its
quite
pale
not
spiced
and
frankly
seems
more
like
a
helles
bock
or
maibock
than
a
christmas
beer
still
quite
drinkable
i
tried
not
to
dock
it
too
hard
for
being
so
out
of
place
but
if
i
were
to
judge
this
as
a
christmas
beer
it
would
be

beer
is
very
fresh
tasting
its
also
light
and
crisp
for
a

it
just

lies

a

this
is
the
first
of
six
beers
i
have
tried
from
a
collection
of
beers
i
bought
called
the
american
collection
i
bought
this
sampler
here
in
germany
i
also
thought
it
was
strange
that
this
beer
was
made
in
wisconsin
this
beer
doesnt
represent
the
usa
well
it
is
not
much
of
a
bock
the
flavor
doesnt
finish
like
one
it
has
a
very
basic
aroma
that
is
a
lot
like
an
american
adjunct
lager
the
body
is
medium
with
an
average
amount
of
bite
there
is
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
and
carapils
sweetness
d
a
touch
too
sweet
and
the
super
thin
body
is
too
light
on
the
palate
drinkability
good
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
just
enough
complexity
to
entertain
the
palate
for
a
while
sold
as
part
of
a
history
of
beer
pack
gifted
to
me
by
my

caramel
and
roasty
black

flavors
are
okay
but
are
too
diluted
finishes
squeaky
clean
tejas
is
way
too
watery
and
light
bodied
to
be
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
a
pretty
boring
beer
this
was
part
of
a
gift
box
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
produced
an
off
white
foamy
two
finger
head
that
faded
to
a
short
head
that
hung
around
for
quite
some
time
it
has
a
light
red
with
good
carbonation
smells
of
roasted
carmel
malts
and
a
little
coppery
tastes
pretty
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
little
hop
finish
not
a
clean
or
well
balanced
flavor
it
has
a
watery
light
bodied
mouthfeel
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
i
really
wonder
if
this
is
even
brewed
with
a
lager
yeast
sure
doesnt
taste
like
any
bock
ive
ever
had
and
the
fruity
esters
make
me
think
this
was
either
brewed
with
an
ale
yeast
or
at
too
high
a
temp
in
the
end
it
doesnt
matter
its
simply
bad
uninspired
beer
deep
coppery
red
with
an
adequately
foamy
head
smell
is
of
weak
malts
taste
is
overall
pretty
bland
but
with
notes
of
roastiness
from
the
black
malts
some
caramel
fruitiness
and
the
same
diacetyl
taste
that
is
in
all
the
other
beers
of
america
though
slightly
toned
down
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
would
drink
this
stuff
again
and
would
possibly
buy
one
if
nothing
else
were
available
all
in
all
i
found
tejas
to
be
dull
boring
and
just
flat
out
weak
d
this
is
one
of
the
most
unbeerlike
beers
ive
ever
tasted
i
really
dont
know
what
to
think
of
it
but
i
dont
think
ill
have
another
notes
this
was
a
rather
bland
beer
and
it
had
very
similar
flavors
to
all
the
other
beers
in
the
mixed
pack
the
best
part
of
this
18
pack
is
the
book
that
came
with
it
bottle
poured
into
a
pills
glass
produced
a
finger
worth
of
fluffy
white
head
on
top
of
a
light
brown
body
you
get
aromas
of
bread
assorted
grains
and
a
little
bit
of
a
sour
note
in
there
as
well
wow
for
a
cheap
brew
the
flavor
is
ok
rather
sweet
malts
a
little
roasted
malt
throw
in
as
well
it
is
light
and
crisp
in
your
mouth
and
rather
refreshing
i
would
drink
another
one
of
these
if
i
was
thirsty
not
a
bad
brew
for
the
price

goblet
aroma
of
caramelized
malt
a
bit
of
cooked
vegetables
and
no
hops
to
speak
of
aroma
was
rather
weak
overall
taste
was
also
a
bit
bland
very
clean
and
crisp
but
i
attribute
that
to
the
lack
of
taste
in
the
first
place
i
did
find
some
sweetness
and
some
metallic
tones
though
probably
wont
want
this
again
notes
from
and
tasted
on

drinkability
what
can
be
said
about
this
beer
its
a
lower
flavor
easy
drinking
beer
as
with
the
other
beers
i
have
had
out
of
this
mixed
sampler
its
a
low
flavor
low
scent
easy
drinker
unfortunately
this
mediocre
beer
is
about
the
best
of
the
bunch
imo
however
there
are
way
better
bocks
to
be
had
go
try
them
d
average
theres
just
nothing
good
about
this
beer
its
all
average
or
just
bad
d
i
guess
its
drinkable
but
i
really
cant
peg
if
this
beer
is
good
or
not
will
i
drink
the
other
3
probably
wont
be
pumped
about
it
but
ill
drink
it
whatever
another
beer
from
the
sampler
pack
made
by
mdii
rochester
ny
once
again
the
book
and
the
tin
case
were
the
best
part
of
this
sampler
pack
a
copperamber
color
thick
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
a
weak
aroma
a
woodycaramel
taste
not
my
first
choice
when
it
comes
to
bock
beers
but
would
drink
it
again
if
somebody
else
buys
dark
brown
in
color
with
very
little
sign
of
the
offwhite
head
and
hints
of
some
lace
as
advertized
it
smells
of
caramel
and
malt
but
not
much
else
to
note
finely
carbonated
fairly
thin
but
the
taste
is
a
nice
caramel
charcoal
deal
very
smooth
very
drinkable
theres
a
touch
of
something
almost
bourbonlike
but
thats
a
stretch
its
not
bad
an
interesting
version
of
bock
drinkability
im
being
generous
with
my
rating
flavors
scents
and
body
are
all
on
the
light
side
but
the
beer
is
refreshing
12oz
bottle
pour
a
clear
copper
amber
body
with
a
small
beige
head
some
patchy
lacing
is
left
behind
on

glass
aroma
is
lacking
just
a
hint
of
toffee
and
spicy
hop
light
body
is
crisply
carbonated
taste
is
subtle
some
restrained
toffee
maltiness
and
spicy

bitterness
not
much
here
but
its
easily
drinkable
more
of
a
michelob
amber
than
any
other
bock
this
wasnt
horrible
but
as
far
as
bocks
go
there
are
so
many
better
ones
out
there
that
i
wouldnt
give
this
one
a
second
look
drinkability
much
like
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
mehh
not
a
drain
pour
but
not
really
that
good
pours
a
thin
brown
color
with
a
weak
head
the
aroma
is
caramel
and
bready
malt
but
not
very
strong
at
all
the
taste
is
a
weak
sweet
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
thin
theres
nothing
really
unpleasant
about
the
beer
but
its
weak
and
uninspiring
as
a
bock
good
mouth
feel
and
very
drinkable
i
dont
know
that
id
go
out
looking
for
this
brew
but
i
could
certainly
kick
back
and
drink
a
half
a
dozen
or
so
dpretty
drinkable
consideringjust
not
one
i
would
recommenednot
worth
the
wasted
stomache
space
i
am
slightly
uncomfortable
with
the
points
i
am
tagging
this
with
i
am
scoring
against
the
style
and
that
is
why
it
is
below
average
if
this
were
say
in
the
dark
lager
category
id
probably
be
adding
another
12
to
a
full
point
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
in
a
nonstyle
driven
generic
way
taste
is
very
watery
very
thin
light
malt
presence
hardly
any
hop
bitterness
lots
of
carbonation
price
is
about
the
bmc
level
so
it
could
easily
be
an
alternative
to
them
since
as
it
goes
down
easily
d
this
is
not
the
most
pleasant
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
not
really
bad
and
would
be
a
better
beer
than
a
lot
of
the
american
lagers
that
are
so
often
chosen
d
disappointing
this
is
about
as
much
a
bock
as
amber
bock
is
in
that
its
lightly
toasty
but
bland
from
the
beers
of
america
18
ct
variety
pack
this
one
pours
a
decent
looking
copper
not
a
bad
start
but
nothing
exceptional
either
its
got
an
offwhite
head
initially
but
this
quickly
dissipates
the
nose
is
pretty
mild
primarily
malt
but
no
discernible
hops
which
i
found
unusual
the
flavor
turned
out
to
be
like
the
nose
primarily
malt
a
bit
sweet
and
some
nuttiness
but
again
little
to
no
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
wasnt
so
hot
its
pretty
thin
like
the
rest
of
the
beers
in
the
pack
other
than
the
porter
drinkability
isnt
bad
considering
its
relative
blandness
but
i
think
beer
advocates
hold
their
brews
to
a
higher
standard
and
shouldnt
accept
something
this
generic
this
one
was
pretty
damn
mediocre
much
like
the
rest
of
the
beers
of
america
dont
waste
your
time
this
beer
had
a
nice
copperybrown
color
but
the
body
could
have
been
a
little
more
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
better
of
the
gift
pack
but
i
would
not
go
looking
for
it
after
these
are
gone
d
barely
finished
with
little
carbonation
keeping
it
together
it
came
across
as
a
flat
bitter
lager
rather
that
a
robust
malty
bock
clear
dark
copper
pour
offwhite
head
that
drops
to
a
skim
pretty
quickly
smell
is
a
tiny
touch
of
malt
and
little
else
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
labels
claims
but
is
clean
and
inoffensive
with
a
onenote
cookielike
malt
flavor
mouthfeel
is
a
real
letdown
as
well
not
worth
drinking
very
smooth
yet
way
to
light
of
palate
no
flavor
lingers
at
all
no
need
to
cleanse
your
palate
after
this
beer
i
got
this
in
one
of
those
beers
across
america
packs
at
bjs
it
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
mix
i
thought
of
one
beer
from
the
first
sip
i
keep
thinking
of
shiner
bock
but
its
been
awhile
since
i
have
last
had
shiner
bock
there
is
a
maltycaramel
after
taste
to
this
beer
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
seem
pretty
standard
it
doesnt
appear
to
have
a
high
alcohol
level
in
this
so
it
seems
like
it
could
be
a
good
session
beer
d
this
is
a
decent
drinking
beer
this
could
be
a
good
one
to
drink
cold
on
a
hot
day
all
in
all
a
good
enough
beer
for
drinking
from
a
mix
pack
like
this
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
taste
is
a
tad
watery
with
a
grainy
finish
and
a
hint
of
metal
again
id
heard
a
few
good
things
about
this
beer
but
in
the
end
its
a
bit
of
a
letdown
bocks
are
supposed
to
be
a
strong
hearty
beer
for
strong
hearty
men
but
this
one
seems
like
a
bock

thicker

anticipated

but
doesnt
overstay
its
welcome
minor
ashy
feel
at
the
end
its
a
very
decent
brew
light
enough
to
have
a
few
but
dark
enough
to
give
some
depth
solid
this
is
an
easy
sipping
bock
that
does
minhas
proud
even
if
its
origins
are
fairly
obscure
part
of
the
beers
of
america
pack
this
one
is
not
too
bad
but
theres
just
not
much
there
some
roasted
flavors
but
nothing
too
substantial
the
booklet
describing
the
beers
is
pretty
interesting
tejas
is
a
native
american
word
meaning
friends
and
was
the
inspiration
for
the
naming
of
the
lone
star
state
tejas
the
beer
is
a
friendly
sort
of
bock
but
it
isnt
one
that
i
care
to
drink
again
while
it
might
be
a
refresher
on
the
hot
dusty
plains
of
west
texas
it
isnt
as
big
or
as
fortifying
as
i
like
my
bocks
to
be
tejas
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
was
short
but
sticks
around
a
while
leaving
a
little
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
fairly
light
but
was
mostly
malt
the
taste
was
mostly
malt
as
well
with
some
roasted
flavor
it
had
a
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
its
an
above
average
brew
taste
starts
with
plum
and
apricot
ripe
fruits
and
moves
into
a
chocolately
caramel
bock
malt
that
gives
way
to
a
really
pleasant
spicy
smokey
ending
solid
but
it
lacks
the
chocoately
sweet
high
or
spice
complexity
of
a
great
bock
d
it
is
drinkable
i
sampled
tejas
as
a
part
of
the
beers
of
america
gift
pack
and
i
thought
it
was
the
best
of
the
lot
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
small
tanlike
head
that
didnt
last
long
very
clear
light
malt
aroma
nice
malt
flavor
balanced
on
the
malty
side
with
enough
hops
that
it
isnt
too
sweet
tastes
more
along
the
lines
of
an
octoberfest
than
a
bock
my
guess
is
this
beer
has
been
dummed
down
and
kept
lighter
bodied
for
the
masses
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
a
bock
this
one
was
hard
to
finish
just
so
bland
it
was
like
drinking
cardboard
flavors
and
aromas
are
lacking
and
the
beer
is
tinted
with
an
odd
overall
flavor
no
thank
you
pretty
decent
taste
nothing
outstanding
though
the
beer
is
good
just
nothing
that
i
would
buy
again
it
just
seems
that
there
is
something
missing
this
beer
pours
a
translucent
brown
with
not
much
of
a
head
or
lace
the
smell
is
of
barley
and
probably
some
corn
it
tasted
kind
of
like
budweiser
with
less
corn
and
a
little
more
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
some
good
carbonation
overall
its
kind
of
like
a
darker
budweiser
im
not
too
impressed
pours
deep

a
modest
light

is
maintained
by
a
nice
cascade
of
bubbles
nose
is
sweet
caramel
with
a
light
roasted
malt
background
but
mostly
just
sweet
caramel
flavor
is
a
decent
balance
between
the
sweetness
from
caramel
malts
and
a
lighter
touch
of
roastyness
to
give
it
an
almost
toasty
character
feel
is
a
rather
full
moderate
with
a
solid
carbonation
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
overall
there
is
just
something
about
this
beer
that
does
not
sit
well
with
me
the
sweetness
almost
seems
chemical
like
its
fake
its
interesting
not
good
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
quite
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
its
really
nothing
special
i
cant
see
myself
going
back
to
this
really
still
its
an
easy
drinking
brew
and
pretty
refreshing
taste
exceedingly
creamy
each
sip
seems
like
its
bursting
into
foam
feels
heavy
in
the
mouth
yet
a
bit
dry
toasty
malt
and
a
small
amount
of
leafy
hop
presence
vanish
to
leave
a
fairly
flavorless
finish
hints
of
leather
the
dryness
level
of
this
is
odd
for
a
bock
theres
a
lot
of
substance

and
i
wasnt

plain

sketchy

the

it

very
smooth

probably
one
of
the
more
drinkable
bocks
i
have
ever
had
i
have
tried
to
find
it

must
have
been
a
oneoff

some

a

of
chocolate
taste
is
the
same
malty
chocolate
slightly
sweet
not
what
i
expected
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
which
considering
the
brewer
is
saying
a
lot
the
crack
revealed
some
brown
foam
that
was
eager
to
escape
its
metallic
canfines
and
i
decided
to
unleash
the
beast
the
aggro
glug
got
a
fine
cascading
action
going
and
i
was
cantent
to
sit
back
and
watch
the
show
this
was
actually
starting
to
look
like
it
might
be
drinkable
i
had
close
to
three
fingers
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deepbrown
with
ruby
highlights
and
nequality
clarity
did
somebody
make
a
mistake
and
make
an
actual
beer
at
that
swill
factory
nose
was
rich
with
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
and
although
i
am
not
into
sweet
beers
there
was
no
way
that
i
was
going
to
dun
them
for
it
mouthfeel
was
mediumto
full
and
the
taste
was
milk
chocolaty
very
tasty
almost
like
a
chocolate
milkshake
finish
was
likewise
quite
sweet
reducing
its
drinkability
for
me
but
a
minor
point
this
disappoints
me
in
the
same
way
that
the
beers
that
come
out
of
the
sandlot
at
coors
field
disappoint
me
if
you
are
capable
of
making
something
decent
then
why
do
you
waste
your
time
brewing
rubbish
color
this
one
worth
a
try
a
flavourful
bock
could
improve
with
some
balance
and
more
complexity
as
its
fairly
straightforward
pretty
tasty
though
not
sure
i
would
recommend
it
highly
poured
out
as
a
decent
looking
brown
color
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
head
settles
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
so
far
so
good
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
lagerlike
aroma
mixed
with
some
caramel
malt
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
decent
but
nothing
exciting
the
caramel
notes
in
the
flavor
are
dominated
by
the
lager
yeast
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
on
this
beer
overall
this
beer
needs
more
malt
it
needs
to
be
sweeter
and
needs
a
stronger
bitterness
in
the
finish
there
isnt
enough
body
to
this
beer
either
its
too
watery
for
a
bock
style
pours
extremely
dark
brown
to
black
it
is
opaque
and
turns
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
there
is
a
small
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
but
leaves
some
light
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
but
tangy
there
is
a
good
bit
of
malt
vinegar
in
the
aroma
and
some
dark
roasted
malt
with
very
light
coffee
and
cocoa
the
aroma
actually
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
some
scottish
ales
the
taste
is
a
justright
sweetness
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
very
dark
dried
fruit
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
this
beer
pours
a
very
deep
amber
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
which
is
unique
for
a
bock
beer
the
taste
is
very
fruity
as
well
with
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
and
i
would
consider
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
a
good
wellbalanced
example
of
a
bock
beer
very
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
session
this
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
bocks
a
nice
find
in
wisconsin
d
damn
good
beer
i
thought
that
this
was
a
lowerquality
local
thing
but
ive
very
pleasantly
surprised
i
found
a
12pack
of
this
for
a
song
at
a
local
joint
and
im
totally
going
back
for
more
cant
pass
up
deals
like
these
good
beer
at
a
good
price
is
harder
and
harder
to
come
by
these
days
its
better
when
its
a
bit
warmer
caramel
malts
come
out
fairly
drinkable
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
fairly
drinkable
but
not
overly
interesting
and
far
from
the
style
yack
ive
had
this
lots
over
the
years
but
this
time
it
got
a
major
problem
with
butterscotch
ill
try
to
get
around
it
but
it
aint
easy
served
with
a
medium
sized
offwhite
head
and
some
lace
color
is
a
nice
not
quite
clear
brown
with
dark
red
highlights
aroma
smacks
me
down
wth
that
butterscotch
ugh
but
somewhere
in
there
is
some
malt
and
a
little
chocolate
good
malt
flavor
is
butterscotch
blaaahh
cant
finish
it
draft
lines
are
clean
here
too
no
more
pleeeeze
i
began
to
buy
this
beer
years
ago
because
of
its
cheap
price
and
also
because
i
enjoy
bock
beers
upon
my
first
taste
i
was
hooked
it
became
a
regular
beer
of
mine
i
couldnt
believe
something
this
tasty
could
be
so
inexpensive
i
felt
i
had
stummbled
upon
something
that
the
rest
of
the
world
didnt
know
about
while
everyone
else
around
me
was
gulping
down
bud
and
miller
products
i
was
savoring
this
caramel
colored
sweet
brew
made
about
75
miles
away
from
my
town
and
i
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
who
knew
about
it
then
i
began
telling
others
about
and
they
soon
became
converts
one
day
i
asked
one
of
these
converts
if
they
were
still
drinkling
huber
bock
he
replied
that
he
stopped
buying
it
because
it
tore
up
his
stomach
it
wasnt
long
after
that
that
i
too
began
running
to
the
bathroom
after
just
drinking
a
few
sips
from
one
bottle
then
one
weekend
i
must
of
drank
about
12
bottles
and
became
deathly
ill
i
even
began
pissing
blood
i
had
never
gotten
so
sick
off
of
beer
before
and
i
tried
returning
the
remaining
bottles
to
the
store
where
i
purchased
them
i
told
the
manager
what
had
happened
and
he
said
i
was
the
first
person
that
he
knew
of
that
had
tried
to
return
beer
in
conclusion
i
would
say
to
you
that
if
you
decide
to
drink
huber
bock
make
sure
there
is
a
bathroom
nearby
with
several
rolls
of
t
p
this
beer
is
a
unique
bock
but
it
fits
all
true
bock
standards
it
has
so
many
freaking
flavors
that
it
seems
like
a
different
beer
as
it
warms
not
just
subtle
variations
i
taste
vanilla
toast
copper
all
spice
caramel
smoke
i
donno
there
are
a
lot
of
flavor
the
body
is
lighter
as
many
bocks
very
drinkable
the
thing
is
when
i
tasted
it
it
actually
was
pretty
good
it
had
a
very
rich
malty
flavor
and
very
low
hops
which
is
what
i
like
about
this
style
also
since
it
was
a
little
on
the
weaker
side
for
a
boch
i
thought
it
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
all
in
all
its
not
bad
for
a
mass
produced
boch
beer
especially
if
your
looking
for
a
break
from
the
super
hoppy
ipas
youve
been
drinking
its
definitely
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
like
this
style
and
cant
to
wait
until
the
truly
great
bochs
get
released
if
you
can
give
it
a
little
bit
of
a
gimmie
for
being
mass
produced
youll
enjoy

the

on

syrupy
side
with
an

note
to

moderate
carbonation
helps
balance
the
flavor
not
a
big
fan
of
bocks
but
this
is
a
decent
beer
d
i
dont
know
why
people
think
this
beer
is
merely
worthy
it
is
solidly
balanced
and
a
good
tasting
easy
drinker
an
overall
good
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
a
delicious
display
of
malts
with
a
proper
counter
balance
of
hops
a
very
good
brew
available
throughout
the
year
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
pretty
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
with
a
finish
that
leaves
some
roasty
flavors
in
the
mouth
also
warms
a
bit
or
presents
warm
flavors
as
it
goes
down
perhaps
a
bit
too
high
in
carbonation
for
my
tastes
tone
it
down
just
a
bit
perhaps
this
is
a
brew
id
not
be
opposed
to
drinking
again
though
i
would
really
like
to
try
some
others
first
not
bad
for
the
price
and
of
the
other
bocks
ive
had
so
far
shiner
and
berghoff
this
is
certainly
better
drinkability
is
this
brews
strong
poitn
mellow
and

a

of
these

the
aroma
and
looks
are
nice
but
it
fails
to
life
up
where
it
counts
the
most
taste
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
eat
with
a
stronger
flavored
blue
cheese
try
it
if
you
want
to
see
what
a
great
beer
is
when
watered
down
much
better
than
many
many
bocks
from
brew
pubs
and
hoitytoity
craft
breweries
drinkability
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
had
maybe
average
vs
a
style
that
i
dont
really
care
for
thanks
to
jpm30
for
this
extra
another
failed
attempt
to
make
a
great
german
bock
by
a
subpar
american
brewer
the
experience
is
more
akin
to
an
irish
red
with
less
cleanliness
or
crispness
the
colors
are
a
fine
brown
with
less
viscocity
than
expected
and
a
nonwithstanding
head
retention
aromas
are
lightly
malty
per
style
with
a
twinge
of
fermentation
sourness
and
graininess
the
flavors
are
irish
red
in
nature
and
lacking
the
deep
complex
tostedness
barley
malt
flavors
the
alcohols
add
nothing
to
the
beer
the
texture
is
weak
and
tacky
to
the
mouth
finishes
a
watery
sweet
its
not
a
badly
brewed
beer
but
its
not
true
to
style
because
of
moneysaving
efforts
by
the
brewer
they
just
got
this
in
at
my
regular
drinking
establishment
and
they
were
kind
enough
to
buy
me
one
while
i
am
always
pleased
with
new
options
this
wasnt
that
exciting
especially
since
it
followed
an
optimator
while
offering
more
malt
and
body
than
the
hubers
ive
had
before
it
fell
somewhat
short
of
what
i
consider
a
standard
bock
to
be
almost
as
if
someone
cut
a
bock
with
a
pilsenser
it
was
to
expected
though
and
i
would
consider
giving
it
a
try
again
considering
the
price
easy
enoughto
drink
light
bodied
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
like
but
still
a
decent
bock
less
than
average
for
style
but
easily
a
satisfying
session
beer
probably
by
far
the
best
of
the
cheap
bocks
but
not
anywhere
near
great
it
pours
a
dark
but
transparent
color
that
resembles
a
flat
cola
with
its
minimal
carbonation
and
no
head
it
definitely
smells
malty
but
not
of
sweet
malts
like
most
bocks
but
of
a
dark
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
malty
but
it
has
a
bit
too
much
hopping
for
a
bock
that
and
its
thin
watery
body
make
it
a
odd
beer
that
i
did
not
much
care
for
at
all
but
it
is
cheap
and
will
do
in
a
pinch
if
milwaukees
beast
is
the
only
other
alternative
pours
dark
caramel
with
a
slowly
dissapating
tan
head
the
smell
is
all
malt
and
so
is
the
taste
it
is
a
very
straight
forward
bock
with
caramel
malt
dominating
and
not
muchh
hops
to
speak
of
it
isnt
a
spectucular
beer
but
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
this
long
running
regional
picked
up
in
another
mixed
six
pack
fairly
simplistic
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
off
white
head
that
vanishes
in
no
time
smell
is
very
faint
almost
non
existent
what
does
pop
up
is
some
sweet
malts
taste
is
very
well
i
never
thought
that
id
describe
a
taste
this
way
but
it
is
very
watery
btw
the
mouthfeel
matches
there
is
a
little
bit
of
roasted
sweetness
to
this
though
ive
had
better
in
my
days
and
i
highly
doubt
that
this
will
warrant
a
future
pickup
from
me
lets
not
beat
around
the
bush
here
you
arent
buying
huber
bock
instead
of
a
bottle
of
maudite
huber
bock
isnt
a
historic
beer
but
it
wins
its
weightclass
every
time
when
placed
up
against
similarly
priced
beers
huber
bock
has
the
extra
flavor
and
bite
to
push
it
over
the
edge
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
just
one
of
the
best
cheap
ass
twelve
pack
beers
around
im
very
impressed
with
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
given
the
fact
that
i
only
paid
6
99
for
a
12
pack
i
almost
feel
like
im
stealing
this
is
a
good
beer
for
any
budget
dark
brown
hue
thin
and
quickly
diminishing
head
a
decent
aroma
of
malts
and
some
chocolate
up
front
rather
thin
some
caramel
and
roasted
malty
taste
yet
they
seem
to
diminish
throughout
some
bready
and
toasty
notes
yet
they
never
develop
finishes
on
the
papery
and
rustic
side
very
little
flavoring
or
character
overall
just
average
one
of
those
beers
where
you
dont
really
expect
much
and
a
hey
not
bad
reaction
is
a
surpirse
poured
a
magnificent
rich
mahogany
color
not
a
lot
of
aroma
and
the
flavor
was
rather
muted
with
some
very
faint
roasted
malt
flavors
a
fair
bit
of
apple
was
present
throughout
the
beer
i
would
have
like
the
beer
to
have
been
more
assertive
in
the
roasted
malt
flavors
but
it
was
quite
pleasant
maybe
a
tich
sweeter
than
the
berghoff
bock
but
for
all
i
know
its
the
same
beer
with
different
labels
deep
clear
garnet
slight
beige
head
in
less
than
a
minute
it
becomes
a
slight
beige
collar
that
sticks
around
lacing
is
adequate
aroma
is
good
sweet
malty
fruitcakey
and
bready
this
beer
almost
feels
a
little
too
carbonated
in
the
mouth
body
is
about
medium
taste
is
decent
a
little
yeasty
a
little
bready
a
little
sugary
caramel
goodness
just
a
titch
of
molasses
all
in
all
a
pretty
average
bock
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
large
light
brown
bubbles
that
left
a
fair
lacing
it
had
an
opaque
black
brown
body
that
was
more
like
a
stout
than
a
bock
its
medium
strength
malt
and
roasted
caramel
arroma
was
very
nice
indeed
its
palate
was
very
smooth
and
it
gad
a
plesant
malt
fore
and
after
taste
this
bock
poured
a
medium
head
with
medium
sized
bubbles
that
mostly
diminished
the
lacing
was
good
and
the
hue
was
brown
it
had
a
moderately
malty
aroma
to
it
and
a
fairly
smooth
flavor
as
well
the
palate
was
light
in
body
and
the
texture
seemed
to
be
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
refuge
head
of
mediumsized
bubbles
incomplete
and
thin
ring
laces
reserved
aroma
barest
sense
of
a
burned
diacetyl
almost
like
movie
popcorn
rather
thin
impression
tealike
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
on
the
tongue
with
a
drawnout
and
similar
aftertaste
a
little
papery
oxidation
not
particularly
good
the
rest
of
the
case
goes
to
the
next
party
i
go
to
im
not
sure
how
this
differs
from
the
berghoff
bock
the
company
puts
out
at
greater
cost
at
12
a
case
how
can
you
complain
this
is
actually
a
good
beer
dark
redbrown
with
a
madium
body
poor
head
retention
but
who
cares
at
0
50
a
brew
nice
malty
flavor
a
hint
of
hops
and
you
can
drink
it
all
night
i
got
hooked
at
college
was
even
cheaper
then
and
now
i
grab
a
few
cases
everytime
im
in
milwaukee
beats
the
heck
out
of
any
other
beer
in
its
price
range
always
love
maple
beers
buy
every
one
i
see
but
i
always
wish
for
more
maple
and
this
one
certainly
didnt
take
me
to
the
promised
land
although
i
liked
the
beer
a
lot
its
a
dopplebock
type
base
beer
its
german
origins
evident
in
both
the
malt
and
the
yeast
which
i
think
makes
maple
a
real
interesting
choice
as
these
flavors
are
not
often
paired
together
especially
in
a
beer
nice
and
dark
and
rich
looking
lathery
off
white
head
with
fine
retention
and
a
thick
dark
mahogany
color
nose
is
sweet
but
bock
comes
before
maple
i
suspect
the
base
beer
is
rather
authentic
and
i
like
that
the
maple
is
an
accent
flavor
and
aroma
but
its
there
and
its
real
i
think
it
was
probably
used
to
spike
the
abv
and
there
is
less
residual
maple
than
i
would
look
for
personally
but
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
the
maple
goes
nicely
with
the
german
malts
which
have
some
sweetness
of
their
own
to
contribute
i
like
this
a
lot
its
filling
for
sure
not
something
i
need
a
whole
lot
of
but
as
always
with
maple
beers
give
me
more
maple
chocolaty
and
toasty
somewhat
porterlike
in
feel
and
body
nice
yeast
taste
and
more
maple
is
noted
in
the
nose
than
the
taste
though
present
in
both
the
hops
are
not
too
powerful
but
give
a
nice
balance
to
the
breadiness
this
was
good
lightmedium
body
odd
complex
beer
glad
they
chose
not
to
over
do
the
maple
like
it
more
as
i
drank
would
drink
again
gf
gave
it
earthy
tree
notes
which
i
agree
medium
bodied
feel
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
bock
i
like
the
maple
influence
and
hints
of
toffee
a
nice
darker
bock
with
a
touch
of
maple
a
wellmade
lager
pairs
well
with
smoked
ham
i
dont
mind
this
one
but
its
clearly
outside
my
bag
not
in
my
wheelhouse
as
some
are
fond
of
saying
im
not
no
abv
given
but
id
put
it
around
5
5
maybe
this
has
to
have
its
fans
out
there
but
as
for
me
i
think
one
is
good
enough
overall
an
ok
beer
can
taste
the
maple
but
it
doesnt
mix
very
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
sweet
maple
are
tart
fruit
maple
bock
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
white
creamy
head
there
is
a
smokey
sweet
like
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
burnt
malty
taste
with
just
hints
of
a
sweet
maple
good
full
flavor
nice
dry
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
a
very
nice
bock
full
flavors
nice
blend
of
syrup
overall
not
to
sweat
with
balance
malty
and
maple
tones
this
is
a
nice
enough
beer
but
it
strikes
me
as
more
of
an
interesting
novelty
type
of
production
than
anything
overtly
noteworthy
the
maple
syrup
provides
a
sweet
and
pleasant
tone
that
defines
things
but
also
limits
everything
as
a
whole
to
the
maple
syrup
and
what
it
provides
16
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
mug
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
some
reddish
tints
theres
also
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
theres
also
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
maple
caramel
molasses
and
some
sweet
malt
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
theres
also
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
the
second
hinterland
beer
ive
tried
and
ive
liked
them
both
ill
definitely
try
more
of
their
other
beers

a
4pack
comes
in
a
16
oz
bottle
the
body
is
strong
without
being
too
heavy
for
the
style
it
leans
that
way
but
it
stops
just
short
its
pretty
smooth
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
in
the
texture
after
just
a
very
slight
crispness
up
in
front
i
found
this
to
be
quite
pleasant
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
by
this
beer
the
flavor
was
more
burnt
than
anything
else
which
is
a
let
down
for
me
because
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
having
this
as
it
was
sitting
in
my
fridge
o
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
i
wont
be
buying
another
four
pack
of
this
particular
beer
but
will
try
some
of
the
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
overall
it
is
nice
bock
with
a
dash
of
maple
overall
this
maple
bock
is
one
of
the
more
robust
bocks
i
have
had
with
out
being
very
sweet
maple
is
in
the
beer
but
you
have
to
really
search
it
out
it
could
be
so
much
bigger
in
this
beer
the
malt
is
fine
but
i
think
a
sweeter
palate
would
have
helped
immensely
3
0
d
not
bad
but
im
not
impressed
and
im
a
bit
disappointed
given
the
very
low
maple
contribution
overall
i
wouldnt
consider
this
a
maple
beer
or
even
a
bock
since
i
got
mostly
roast
i
consider
it
mainly
a
porter
wouldnt
buy
again
pours
a
strikingly
dark
hazy
mahogany
with
a
half
finger
of
tan
foam
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
leaving
fits
of
lace
and
rings
smells
distinctly
and
deliciously
of
maple
with
a
complimentary
underpinning
of
biscuit
malt
very
nice
the
maple
element
isnt
nearly
as
apparent
in
the
taste
there
is
a
slight
maple
vein
in
waht
is
mostly
a
biscuit
bready
slightly
caramel

slightly
sweet
but
finishes
mostly
clean

somewhat
acidic
medium

low

good
drinking

wish
it
had
more
maple
overall
not
a
bad
beer
id
call
it
borderline
better
than
averagegood
with
this
style
there
is
such
a
range
of
interpretations
its
hard
to
know
what
youre
getting
into
i
think
an
extra
hop
flavor
charge
and
maybe
some
low
degree
crystal
malts
may
help
balance
this
a
little
bit
paired
with
a
lower
ferment
temp
or
maybe
changing
yeast
up
o
very
nice
beer
the
maple
can
be
hit
and
miss
id
like
more
maple
in
a
maple
bock
but
beggars
cant
be
choosers
oprobably
not
something
i
would
ever
turn
down
if
offered
but
just
not
enough
maple
flavor
for
me
to
warrant
buying
again

though
the

pretty
decent

perfect
w

eggs
and
bacon
o
liked
this
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
not
sure
if
i
would
by
again
but
would
drink
again
it
looked
good
in
my
snifter
a
slick
black
brew
with
minimal
head
which
disipated
fast
but
id
just
poured
it
after
walking
in
from
a
january
night
dog
walk
was
my
nose
too
stuffed
up
to
appreciate
the
bouquet
in
fact
it
wasnt
there
are
faint
hints
of
a
roasty
stout
but
thats
it
faint
hints
there
is
a
light
lingering
hop
after
taste
but
let
me
emphasize
light
after
a
while
this
opened
up
to
some
more
flavors
but
beyond
that
there
was
not
much
to
taste
from
this
maple
bock
not
even
the
maple
this
was
a
let
down
from
hinterland
but
not
all
was
lost
with
a
steal
of
a
purchase
at
3
for
a
single
pint
bottle
from
armanettis
on
lincoln
overall
again
another
spot
on
brew
by
hinterland
ive
heard
they
might
offer
this
in
a
barrel
aged
and
i
cant
wait
to
check
that
out
overall
this
beer
is
killer
i
paired
this
with
a
pork
butt
that
i
braised
in
this
beer
and
together
it
was
awesome
recommend
yum
overall
nice
drinkable
beer
jeez
i
just
now
looked
at
the
abv
this
could
be
a
troublesome
beer
maple
wasnt
too
apparent
for
me
in
the
flavor
although
its
effects
were
noticeable
in
the
mouthfeel
im
wondering
if
this
was
a
sweeter
beer
when
released
in
the
spring
early
summer
it
was
also
hopped
a
bit
more
heavily
than
ive
previously
experienced
in
the
style
still
all
things
considered
a
tasty
option
got
a
bottle
from
my
buddy
this
beer
pours
great
into
a
pint
glass
looks
and
smells
amazing
this
beer
will
pour
with
a
thick
and
creamy
head
it
looks
beautiful
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
maple
syrup
taste
since
it
is
in
the
name
but
they
definitely
dont
overdo
it
the
mouthfeel
is
just
how
it
looks
thick
and
creamy
this
is
handsdown
the
best
bock
i
have
ever
drank
the
maple
taste
is
there
but
it
is
not
overdone
and
is
in
the
background
if
you
see
this
beer
at
your
local
liquor
store
it
is
a
mustbuy
if
you
like
bocks
very
nice
winter
beer
love
the
rich
maltiness
of
this
combined
with
the
sweet
maple
and
bock
flavors
overall
my
first
hinterland
beer
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
it
was
not
what
i
expected
at
all
i
wanted
the
maple
to
become
more
of
a
star
player
in
this
beer
and
it
was
not
at
all
sweet
like
i
thought
it
would
be
not
really
a
bock
to
me
either
regardless
of
those
minor
details
this
beer
is
still
damn
good
o
this
is
truly
a
great
bock
there
are
only
two
negative
things
i
could
say
which
are
both
fairly
minor
first
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
but
this
can
also
be
fixed
by
a
slightly
harder
pour
to
drive
off
the
excess
co2
second
it
wasnt
as
maplely
as
i
would
of
thought
then
again
that
can
also
be
attributed
to
brewing
skill
depending
on
the
brewers
intention
intentions
aside
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
cellaring
some
to
see
how
they
develop
robust
flavor
bittersweet
with
some
chocolate
malt
woody
toastiness
finishing
dry
with
no
residual
sweetness
at
all
similar
to
real
maple
its
not
a
sweet
taste
or
cloying
either
lingering
traces
of
hearty
malt
flavors
medium
bodied
but
easily
drinkable
the
dryness
is
a
nice
characteristic
more
pleasant
that
ultrasweet
bocks
im
not
sure
the
term
maple
helps
the
perception
in
this
case
as
it
surely
influenced
my
expectations
regardless
this
is
a
very
good
wisconsin
bock
odont
expect
a
lot
of
maple
dont
expect
a
lot
of
basic
bock
characteristics
do
expect
a
nice
tasty
beer
a
bit
different
but
enjoyable
and
drinkable
again
some
age
does
this
beer
some
good
the
first
bottles
i
cracked
were
nowhere
near
as
amazing
as
this
one
a
knockout
bock
from
hinterland
ive
never
had
anything
else
like
it
d
a
tad
sweet
at
times
but
a
very
solid
bock
it
enters
the
mouth
porty
dense
and
full
then
deflates
as
it
travels
towards
the
throat
carbonation
is
stunted
then
seems
to
die
altogether
with
a
better
feel
representation
this
could
be
a
home
run
of
a
bock
its
a
solid
standup
double
as
it
just
dont
come
here
expecting
a
bottle
of
maple
syrup
d
i
love
bocks
and
this
one
does
not
disappoint
i
wanted
more
maple
but
im
not
complaining
very
tasty
d
not
bad
overall
an
interesting
beer
d
i
was
excited
to
hear
about
this
beer
but
upon
tasting
it
i
was
a
little
let
down
that
the
maple
flavor
wasnt
stronger
still
a
good
offering
but
if
you
are
looking
for
more
maple
look
elsewhere
drinkabilty
i
think
this
is
a
relatively
good
beer
i
was
kinda
expecting
a
little
more
upfront
maple
but
am
rather
glad
they
were
conservative
with
it
so
it
didnt
overpower
the
beer
itself
i
could
definitely
sit
and
drink
a
couple
of
these
picked
up
a
single
over
in
wiscoland
since
id
never
seen
it
before
tasty
but
i
cant
believe
how
thin
the
beer
felt
it
had
a
good
head
but
the
carbonation
didnt
come
through
in
the
feel
interesting
d
hinterland
has
nailed
this
beer
it
is
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
i
usually
look
past
bocks
this
has
changed
my
opinion
of
them
worth
seeking
out
d
i
was
very
hesitant
about
getting
this
i
love
beer
and
maple
syrup
but
together
this
beer
just
works
so
well
the
alcohol
warmth
and
flavor
will
quench
your
soul
with
wi
goodness
this
is
a
sipper
and
should
not
be
missed
a
nice
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
the
maple
syrup
to
stand
out
more
drinks
easily
and
is
worth
a
try
d
while
i
knew
not
to
expect
actual
maple
syrup
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
continued
to
desire
it
but
that
didnt
keep
me
from
enjoying
this
new
hinterland
brew
it
never
gets
overthetop
or
too
unbalanced
in
any
way
but
id
be
hardpressed
to
jump
right
into
a
second
pint
of
it
without
something
lighter
to
swig
drinkability
good
500
ml
bottle
from
dirtylou
paired
with
a
kitchen
sink
drinkability
very
drinkable
although
a
better
flavor
profile
would
bump
this
category
score
up
to

this
was
a
deep
clear
rubyred
liquid
with
a
decent
mediumbrown
head
above
it
it
had
an
absolutely
super
nose
of
maple
syrup
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
slightly
hot
on
the
tongue
with
a
great
malty
sweetness
the
finish

phew
bartender
another
please
o
a
nice
dark
lager
packed
with
tasty
dark
malt
flavours
a
good
entry
in
the
bock
category
i
do
dare
say
its
been
some
time
since
ive
had
one
and
need
to
get
more
in
stock
for
winter
enjoy
overall
a
nice
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
a
good
balanced
malty
bock
beer
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
not
a
lot
of
complexity
but
works
as
a
fairly
tasty
session
beer
would
have
again
but
not
something
i
found
all
that
interesting
warms
nicely
overall
a
tasty
bock
im
glad
i
tried
however
it
was
a
slight
letdown
after
viewing
the
beer
before
trying
it
still
another
good
entry
from
one
of
ontarios
best
and
most
prolific
craft
brewers
final
thoughts
ive
only
had
one
other
offering
from
creemore
springs
their
kellerbier
which
i
enjoyed
as
well
they
brew
proof
that
lagers
arent
just
for
bmc
drinkers
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
but
id
be
more
interested
in
trying
their
other
offerings
o
one
of
my
go
to
beers
i
enjoy
the
bitterness
it
leaves
you
with
a
great
beer
for
after
a
long
day
of
school
and
studying
o
this
is
a
great
bock
i
look
forward
to
this
time
of
year
every
year
to
be
able
to
have
a
few
of
these
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
loads
of
flavour
easy
drinking
and
at
6
a
nice
ale
for
a
cloudy
autumn
day
or
in
my
case
a
rainy
spring
afternoon
i
would
toss
back
a
6er
of
this
no
problem
o
creemore
puts
out
a
quality
brew
this
one
is
by
far
my
favorite
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
though
i
dont
know
if
id
actively
seek
it
out
in
the
future
o
a
tasty
full
bodied
bock
well
rounded
and
smooth
enough
to
be
sessionable
well
done
m
as
a
lager
this
one
has
to
has
a
medium
body
at
the
most
be
refreshing
and
actually
it
is
the
problem
is
that
there
is
not
sweetness
present
as
expected
in
a
buck
or
in
a
beer
with
high
alcohol
and
the
bitterness
should
be
low
and
it
is
present
in
the
end
reddish
brown
in
colour
with
crystal
clarity
pours
with
a
poorly
retained
cap
of
thick
beige
head
that
doesnt
lace
mild
aroma
has
notes
of
baking
bread
caramel
brown
sugar
and
raisins
tastes
sweet
and
malty
up
front
with
notes
of
toasted
bread
honey
and
raisins
a
mild
nutty
character
shows
up
midway
through
along
with
some
tangy
plum
finishes
with
sweet
caramel
and
a
light
bitterness
that
shows
some
linger
mediumbodied
with
low
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
its
kind
of
deceptive
the
way
this
has
a
much
fuller
flavour
than
the
aroma
suggests
thats
not
a
complaint
though
its
more
of
a
pleasant
surprise
lacks
a
little
in
richness
overall
nothing
complex
here
just
a
nice
malty
beer
that
goes
back
easy
if
i
had
another
itd
be
gone
too
o
a
soso
offering
from
the
molsonowned
granville
island
brewing
of
the
east
taste
and
mouthfeel
light
bodied
but
a
bit
slick
and
very
strongly
carbonated
flavours
of
plum
lightly
roasted
malt
bread
and
subtle
bitterness
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
pretty
well
suited
for
this
cold
ass
fall
afternoon

feels
like
winter
too
me
but
i
do
live
in
calgary
i
might
get
board
of
a
6
pack
but
the
2
pint
sized
cans
in
the
creemore
winter
mixer
looking
pretty
good
with
some
other
offerings

mix
things

enjoy
this
quite
a

even
though
its
probably
not
the
best
stylistically
although
bock
is
not
my
favourite
style
i
view
this
as
a
decent
example
of
it
i
e
similar
to
many
pints
enjoyed
in
germany
very
glad
molsons
continues
to
let
creemore
brew
without
interference
overall
i
started
out
not
really
liking
it
but
warmed
up
to
it
still
i
wasnt
really
impressed
with
it
per
se
another
good
offering
from
creemore
md
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
its
good
easy
drinking
but
seemed
to
be
a
little
on
the
flat
side
very
drinkableif
i
could
change
one
thing
i
wish
it
was
a
wee
bit
heavier
i
like
this
smooth
dark
lager
and
would
definitely
have
another
not
the
best
bock
ive
had
but
not
the
worst
either
libation
i
must
admit
this
seems
to
have
a
undertone
of
creemores
best
offering
their
premium
lager
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
bock
with
some
interesting
aspects
drinkable
yes
memorable
no
pours
a
rusty
red
with
a
few
fingers
of
thick
and
creamy
eggshell
head
leaves
some
lace
and
retains
its
head
well
nose
has
some
earthy
hops
light
grain
and
a
general
sense
of
the
malt
sweetness
nothing
exciting
here
and
the
taste
proves
this
some
of
the
hops
upfront
light
toffee
and
caramel
notes
and
some
graininess
alcohol
isnt
disguised
and
that
a
disappointment
at
relatively
low
abv
however
its
got
a
decent
creamy
mouthfeel
not
a
ton
of
flavour
going
for
this
one
simple
and
straightforward
medium
drinkability
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
passable
but
far
from
noteworthy
this
beer
also
has
some
nice
warming
qualities
making
it
a
great
seasonal
choice
another
quality
product
from
a
great
brewery
and
frankly
one
id
enjoy
yearround
if
it
were
available
drink
im
not
sure
if
i
just
got
the
end
of
a
keg
or
something
but
the
beer
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
it
is
from
a
can
still
an
above
average
beer
though
im
rarely
disappointed
with
creemore
products
d
this
is
a
nice
cold
weather
lager
a
nice
malty
brew
i
could
have
a
few
on
a
cold
evening
like
tonight
nothing
really
screams
dont
drink
me
with
this
one
ive
had
the
urbock
from
creemore
a
few
times
before
and
its
always
been
a
decent
brew
d
easy
to
drink
but
has
a
bit
too
much
grassy
flavor
for
me
if
i
had
the
option
id
go
with
creemores
lager
or
kellerbier
first
all
of
these
are
good
options
though
and
i
consider
creemore
springs
to
be
one
of
the
better
breweries
in
ontario
for
having
products
that
are
consistently
above
what
else
is
available
here
pours
a
dark
amber
colour
with
a
decent
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
of
dark
and
caramel
malt
grassiness
with
a
metallic
hint
taste
is
again
bready
caramel
malt
light
grassiness
from
the
hops
leading
to
a
lightly
bitter
finish
with
just
the
faintest
tingle
of
alcohol
warmth
fairly
lightbodied
with
pleasant
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinker
for
the
cooler
months
pours
an
amber
brown
colour
with
off
white
head
some
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
toasted
malt
caramel
and
grassy
hops
flavour
has
a
punch
of
bitterness
that
i
didnt
expect
with
lots
of
sweetness
medium
bodied
carbonation
i
like
all
of
creemores
offerings
this
beer
is
alright
but
seems
to
have
a
certain
macro
quality
to
it
maybe
im
just
imagining
things
but
i
feel
it
tastes
like
it
would
have
been
better
made
in
smaller
batches
or
with
less
filtration
or
something
im
no
brewer
i
cant
say
what
the
culprit
is
its
kind
of
riding
just
above
average
on
all
counts
in
any
case
its
a
fairly
drinkable
bock
although
not
one
ill
be
buying
again
thanks
for
the
sample
eric
caramel
and
bread
dark
fruits
touch
of
grassy
hops
in
there
light
drying
finish
thin
sweetness
behind
in
there
pretty
light
body
though
it
makes
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
pleasant
carbonation
nothing
wowing
here
but
a
pleasant
changeup
from
ontarios
premier
lager
brewers
a
nice
light
easydrinking
beer
with
a
bit
of
pleasant
malt
not
hefty
just
drinkable
going
to
go
great
with
my
steak
this
pleasant
spring
evening
a
pretty
decent
and
flavourful
bock
from
a
consistently
impressive
brewery
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
ive
been
passing
it
by
at
the
lcbo
for
too
long
its
not
my
favorite
creemore
brew
as
it
could
have
been
a
bit
more
hearty
but
its
quite
tasty
and
is
going
down
well
this
is
a
great
brew
and
im
glad
creemore
have
kept
it
up
though
i
reiterate
my
lamentation
on
its
lack
of
availability
come
spring
d
this
is
my
firdt
bock
and
im
not
that
impressed
with
it
thus
far
it
was
nothing
unique
or
defining
for
me
hope
to
have
better
ones
in
the
future
nothing
off
putting
its
good
to
see
some
drinkable
canadian
crafts
in
the
lcbo
the
carbonation
seemed
light
our
server
mentioned
this
was
her
favorite
red
beer
so
i
am
left
wondering
if
it
was
perhaps
served
too
cold
it
was
quite
cold
or
if
she
just
doesnt
have
the
same
beer
tastes
as
i
do
d
balanced
enough
that
it
drinks
quite
easily
first
taste
is
a
rush
of
malts
very
creamy
carbonation
subsides
into
a
balanced
caramel
malty
bitterness
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
low
carbonation
is
great
in
this
beer
ive
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
malt
malt
malt
oh
and
caramel
worth
a
try
overall
a
decent
offering
from
creemore
but
not
their
best
if
the
body
was
a
little
heavier
and
flavours
not
as
watered
down
this
would
be
hands
down
my
favourite
creemore
brew
had
this
on
tap
at
the
winking
judge
in
hamilton
ontario
pours
an
amberrouge
body
with
minimal
head
present
a
little
watery
but
the
taste
was
still
great
malty
sweetness
was
what
i
was
getting
overall
a
well
balanced
beer
which
i
imagine
would
be
really
nice
after
a
hard
days
work
final
thoughts
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
disappointment
mainly
because
of
how
good
the
creemore
lager
is
its
still
pretty
good
but
its
not
sitting
very
well
which
is
really
a
shame
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
some
nice
dripping
lace
going
on
smell
is
sweet
raisiny
malt
some
initial
bitterness
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
is
backed
by
slightly
pruney
malt
theres
definitely
alcohol
in
this
its
nicely
warming
id
like
to
see
more
malt
in
this
though
a
lot
more
and
just
more
flavor
it
seems
to
be
missing
something
and
it
lacks
depth
it
has
a
clean
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
and
almost
watery
yeah
its
drinkable
its
not
horrible
but
im
a
little
underwhelmed
ill
happily
finish
the
six
pack
i
bought
but
this
is
definitely
not
a
repeater
too
bad
i
love
creemores
lager
and
i
like
their
pilsner
so
i
expected
more
from
this
theres
still
half
a
glass
left
in
front
of
me
and
im
not
at
all
anxious
to
finish
it
i
didnt
notice
too
much
of
a
difference
when
creemore
was
bought
out
by
molsons
but
i
will
say
this
the
once
decent
urbock
is
now
nothing
more
than
another
macro
kitsch
imposture
peddled
as
a
small
scale
take
on
a
rich
distinct
style
whether
thats
a
change
in
my
tastes
or
a
change
in
the
production
i
cant
say
what
i
do
know
i
wont
be
revisiting
a
christmas
present
from
a
canadian
uncle
one
of
the
few
nice
offerings
ive
had
from
the
great
white
north
pours
a
brown
color
with
red
highlights
a
small
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
nose
is
mild
maltiness
and
the
taste
expands
on
it
a
little
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
and
some
spicy
molasses
bodys
fine
appropriate
to
the
style
overall
not
bad
but
certainly
not
good
by
any
means
tastes
of
fruits
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
and
a
whimper
of
alcohol
well
i
am
happy
i
was
able
to
try
it
not
sure
how
fresh
this
is
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
creemores
brews
i
had
this
first
in
2006
and
it
was
amazing
in
every
aspect
had
it
again
in
2007
and
it
failed
to
please
my
senses
nice
dark
red
colour
nice
head
that
disappears
too
fast
great
malty
spicy
raisin
flavour
and
the
smell
i
dont
really
remember
but
it
was
good
i
would
buy
this
one
again
this
beer
is
even
better
on
tap
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
the
scent
and
taste
are
not
strong
but
the
lingering
aftertaste
is
quite
pleasant
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
12oz
bottle
purchased
from
lcbo
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
big
head
due
to
a
poor
pour
but
the
head
goes
away
pretty
quickly
little
lacing
reasonable
malty
aroma
flavour
is
malt
and
thats
about
it
finishes
a
bit
thin
ive
not
much
of
a
bock
fan
and
this
one
doesnt
get
me
any
closer
to
changing
my
mind
sampled
at
the
cest
what
fall
festival
of
beers
nice
dark
russet
body
with
an
effusive
white
head
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
and
the
flavour
with
a
fair
bit
of
fruitiness
and
grain
surprisingly
thick
consistency
with
a
creamy
aftertaste
quite
a
pleasant
brew
from
creemore
first
impression
of
the
flavour
is
an
almost
overwhelming
soapy
note
that
im
sure
is
just
a
lot
of
herbal
hops
but
comes
off
unpleasant
theres
a
slight
metallic
sharpness
as
well
it
does
get
better
though
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
bready
at
first
with
some
dark
fruity
flavours
a
bit
medicinal
like
cough
syrup
in
its
delivery
a
bit
of
pepper
to
give
it
some
zip
finish
is
earthy
potently
herbal
hursky
and
crackery
mouthfeel
is
mediumthick
in
body
with
a
zippy
carbonation
drier
than
i
expected
it
would
be
overall
not
a
brutal
effort
but
the
lack
of
balance
in
the
actual
flavour
is
a
little
offputting
lots
of
individual
elements
not
enough
harmony
pours
the
colour
of
cherry
cola
with
very
little
foam
smell
is
a
bit
sharp
grain
dark
and
sour
fruityet
not
citrus
and
cut
grass
very
good
taste
malty
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
plum
and
cherry
relatively
thick
full
mouthfeel
i
like
it
and
will
be
buying
it
again
not
complex
but
a
good
beer
this
is
still
drinkable
and
clean
but
this
year
has
a
character
that
seems
to
lack
a
defined
bock
identity
thinner
than
one
expects
in
a
dark
bock
more
like
a
dunkelschwarzbier
hybrid
i
still
bought
a
case
i
like
dark
beers
and
was
excited
to
hear
that
creemore
springs
makes
a
bock
the
fact
that
its
a
seasonal
is
kinda
cool
too
pours
a
dark
ruby
body
theres
minimal
head
but
the
colour
makes
it
look
thirstquenching
some
grainy
brownish
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
of
bready
malt
red
wine
prunes
and
alcohol
taste
has
a
bold
malt
character
with
an
initial
alcoholic
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
what
this
beer
is
all
about
starts
off
with
a
moderately
carbonated
bite
and
goes
down
smooth
the
aftertaste
fades
away
quickly
this
beer
is
nothing
special
but
its
still
drinkable
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
reasonably
wellhidden
by
a
malty
taste
and
crisp
mouthfeel
decent
brew
creemore
springs
urbock
is
a
respectable
brew
that
fails
to
amaze
but
also
doesnt
dissapoint
taste
is
interesting
enough
to
appeal
to
a
beer
advocate
and
even
if
its
nothing
superbly
special
its
also
something
ill
look
forward
to
around
the
christmas
season
worth
a
try
i
say
but
only
after
youve
tried
creemores
excellent
lager
first
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
very
mild
aftertaste
with
no
off
notes
quite
drinkable
and
im
not
sure
which
of
creemores
two
main
offerings
i
like
better
although
i
think
id
still
lean
toward
the
other
one
this
poured
a
nice
dark
red
almost
brown
with
a
very
small
head
that
didnt
last
very
long
smell
is
good
fresh
barley
malt
this
stuff
tastes
great
a
caramel
body
with
a
mildly
bitter
finish
its
carbonation
is
pretty
strong
but
not
overbearing
as
to
make
it
hard
to
swallow
this
stuff
is
dangerously
easy
to
drink
apparently
this
wont
be
around
long
so
i
hope
to
enjoy
this
until
the
end
of
the
season
comes
along
d
very
drinkable
this
one
can
be
trouble
this
is
one
incredible
bock
its
not
overly
sweet
like
i
find
so
many
others
of
the
style
it
has
great
balance
and
an
incredibly
nuanced
malt
character
this
beer
is
a
must
try
especially
if
you
arent
big
on
bocks
pours
a
mahogany
redbrown
large
offwhite
head
forms
goes
away
rather
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
smells
sweet
grassy
earthy
some
citrus
notes
are
present
tastes
pretty
rich
and
malty
some
sweetness
some
floral
hoppiness
to
the
end
and
a
smooth
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
very
smooth
this
one
has
been
sitting
around
for
a
while
to
mellow
it
gains
a
nice
roastyhoppy
character
decent
brew
for
ontario
mostly
clear
medium
brown
colour
with
deep
coppery
red
highlights
topped
by
a
thin
light
tan
head
rich
malty
aroma
with
some
caramel
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
some
british
ales
some
graininess
and
a
light
floral
hop
smell
creamy
malty
flavour
thats
balanced
towards
sweetness
little
bitterness
or
hop
flavour
with
the
graininess
coming
through
here
as
well
mediumfull
body
with
moderate
carbonation
composed
of
very
fine
bubbles
that
meld
well
with
the
body
theres
also
a
bit
of
stickiness
that
remains
on
the
palate
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
just
hope
molsoncoors
decides
to
keep
this
one
taste
relatively
light
carbonation
and
taste
roasty
caramel
and
maybe
a
bit
buttery
mouthfeel
is
superior
to
most
lagers
at
first
but
dies
off
quickly
a
very
darm
amber
beer
who
goes
into
the
color
of
the
wine
with
no
head
only
a
little
head
smells
of
caramel
and
malt
nothing
else
the
taste
is
very
smooth
maltish
flavors
of
roasted
coffeeespresso
caramel
and
alcohol
a
taste
of
chocolate
is
also
perceivable
at
much
pretty
sweet
of
a
seasonal
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
will
help
take
a
bit
of
the
chill
off
of
the
winter
months
now
2004
my
first
thought
pulling
the
bottle
out
of
the
sixpack
was
actually
surprise
at
how
light
it
was
which
makes
rereading
my
prior
review
a
little
amusing
to
me
redgold
honey
a
limited
head
its
quite
crisp
with
hop
bite
battling
the
bocky
malt
sweetness
all
the
way
through
its
rather
refreshing
when
you
put
it
up
against
all
the
heavy
bocks
around
this
time
of
year
quite
a
tasty
bock
but
bocks
are
just
not
my
favourite
thanks
to
northyorksammy
this
is
a
looker
of
a
beer
a
seductive
clear
chestnut
hue
with
a
quick
splash
of
beige
head
spiced
fruit
on
the
nose
burnt
malt
that
comes
across
sweet
as
well
with
a
trace
of
alcohol
the
flavour
occurs
in
layers
dried
fruit
and
spice
at
first
with
a
fullbodied
mouthfeel
which
then
drops
to
a
bold
roasted
malt
presence
in
the
middle
and
then
melds
into
a
grassy
hop
finish
which
is
more
oily
on
the
palate
blended
with
a
sweet
caramel
accent
the
flavours
and
textures
take
you
around
the
block
a
few
times
and
its
a
pleasant
trip
each
time
complex
enough
to
keep
me
interested
but
not
something
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
good
thing
its
a
seasonal
2005
version
on
tap
smooth
creamy
dry
a
variation
of
the
creemore
cream
tap
copper
brew
with
a
small
head
malty
aroma
with
a
medium
body
taste
is
very
creamy
which
i
approved
with
small
traced
of
burnt
malt
not
the
best
of
bock
but
still
a
great
beer
that
should
be
made
available
all
year
long
the
creemore
brewery
is
starting
to
impress
me
with
two
great
german
inspired
brew
lager
and
bock
solid
unsensational
beer
good
with
a
meal
suitable
for
introducing
neophytes
to
something
a
little
different
drinkability
above
average
nothing
in
this
beer
to
remember
it
by
but
not
a
burden
on
the
palate
having
read
the
description
of
the
style
i
guess
i
expected
more
of
a
hop
influence
being
the
hophead
that
i
am
i
guess
what
i
am
trying
to
say
here
is
that
this
brew
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
fine
product
but
needs
to
be
critiqued
by
a
more
knowledgeable
person
than
i
the
look
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
left
me
looking
for
something
more
it
lacked
a
distinct
flavour
a
signature
of
its
own
maybe
my
opinion
is
skewed
in
part
because
of
my
love
for
creemore
springs
lager
one
sip
of
the
lager
whether
youre
in
canada
or
half
way
across
the
world
and
you
know
its
creemore
lager
that
is
the
distinct
impression
left
by
that
beer
but
the
urbock
i
dont
know
i
was
underwhelmed
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
however
quite
ordinary
the
beer
pours
a
somewhat
murky
brown
the
head
is
modest
in
size
the
lace
fair
and
clings
in
sheets
to
the
glass
nose
is
malt
caramel
somewhat
sweet
as
in
ripe
fruit
start
is
lightly
malt
sweet
the
top
is
middling
the
finish
is
piddlingly
acidic
and
puny
in
the
hops
arena
dry
aftertaste
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
just
a
little
wimpy
on
the
hops
but
then
im
a
hop
head
overall
not
a
typical
german
bockbier
but
quite
tasty
and
easily
recommended
o
overall
a
very
heavy
dark
bok
thats
more
along
the
lines
of
a
porter
than
a
typical
bok
bier
but
still
very
enjoyable
especially
on
a
cold
fall
day
a
very
tasty
bock
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
pity
there
were
so
mant
to
try
or
i
could
have
stayed
on
this
for
another
one
or
three
poured
a
1
head
which
dissipated
quickly
clear
burnt
umber
brown
in
color
smell
and
taste
both
are
mildly
chocolate
malt
and
its
followed
up
by
a
pleasant
long
acidic
zing
really
a
pretty
nice
bock
what
was
most
notable
of
all
was
the
massive
amount
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
must
have
been
at
least
14
solid
thick
sediment
and
it
came
out
during
the
pour
as
big
globs
it
didnt
bother
me
ive
just
never
seen
so
much
in
a
bottle
o
good
beer
nice
winter
beer
light
chilled
its
becoming
better
d
the
watery
sourness
drives
down
the
drinkability
of
jopen
bokbier
the
bottle
conditioning
is
generally
a
good
thing
but
the
huge
clumps
of
yeast
actually
detract
from
the
experience
see
hefeweizen
or
coopers
sparkling
ale
for
a
better
yeastintheglass
example
jopen
bokbier
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
for
the
style
alcohol
is
totally
masked
by
the
heavy
caramel
flavor
this
beer
has
more
flavor
than
most
doppelbocks
ive
had
and
i
would
drink
this
regularly
if
i
could
this
has
easily
become
my
favorite
bock
in
one
beers
time
d
an
extraordinairy
bockbeer
has
some
oatmeal
stout
character
in
it
very
drinkable
overall
as
mentioned
by
other
reviewers
as
well
this
is
not
a
typical
german
bockbeer
more
ale
like
but
man
is
this
good
or
what
not
a
prime
example
of
bock
bier
but
still
a
good
beer
period
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
with
white
chunks
of
sediment
floating
around
i
guess
i
poured
a
bit
too
much
nose
is
kind
of
musty
with
a
malt
tone
to
it
and
just
a
very
slight
touch
of
wood
robust
but
mild
aged
dark
fruit
skins
there
as
well
flavor
is
a
nice
hearty
malt
with
a
touch
of
dark
sugar
a
little
bit
of
wood
feel
is
nice
high
carbonation
hitting
the
tongue
thick
liquid
feel
for
sure
overall
this
is
an
unusual
bock
at
least
in
comparison
to
the
more
traditional
styles
i
like
it
as
it
is
well
made
it
just
isnt
your
typical
example
of
the
style
poured
from
a
30cl
bottle
3
00
in
detroit
into
a
pint
glass
the
appearance
is
murky
brown
tons
of
large
yeastie
floaters
3finger
foam
which
loses
2
fingers
after
about
a
minute
the
aroma
is
bocky
sweet
and
malty
but
with
a
bit
of
a
sour
acidic
edge
to
it
almost
metallic
the
taste
is
very
good
with
all
the
flavors
promised
from
the
aroma
nicely
drinkable
but
not
really
worth
the
price
when
you
can
get
better
versions
imported
from
germany
for
cheaper
prices
30
cl

1
oz
short
brown
bottle
a
dark
murky
color
with
a
head
that
pours
tall
but
falls
fast
aromas
of
dried
fruit
and
sweet
plums
first
taste
was
a
little
astringent
but
warmed
quickly
in
the
mouth
and
left
nice
dried
cherry
and
peach
aspects
overall
finish
was
kind
of
nutty
and
kind
of
resinous
was
a
decent
bok
style
but
a
little
dry
in
the
finish
not
the
best
of
beers
of
jopen
and
for
sure
not
a
typical
dutch
bockbeer
but
a
good
beer
nevertheless
great
drinkability
very
enjoyable
beer
d
not
bad
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
oh
well
on
to
my
cellar
for
more
great
thanksgiving
beers
overall
an
excellent
bock
marred
by
insanely
excessive
sediment
the
cap
poped
off
with
a
mighty
blow
and
the
head
poured
so
big
and
thick
that
it
doesnt
want
to
go
away
at
all
the
head
looks
like
sparkling
snow
in
winter
the
color
is
reddish
to
light
brown
theres
also
some
yeast
floating
around
in
there
the
smell
is
powerful
and
woody
but
sour
sweet
with
fruitiness
the
taste
is
nice
with
roasted
malts
it
tastes
great
with
some
sour
fruit
thats
sweet
at
the
same
time
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
not
harsh
for
all
the
carbonation
seen
earlier
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
definetly
have
more
good
stuff
holland
d
a
toss
up
on
this
one
this
beer
is
a
lot
of
work
to
get
a
decent
pour
and
finish
without
a
spork
ill
probably
pass
in
the
future
but
an
enjoyable
and
educating
experience
901
this
is
a
finelycrafted
beer
i
may
have
to
reassess
my
earlier
lack
of
enthusiasm
for
the
style
since
the
last
two
bocks
that
ive
had
have
been
good
to
very
good
i
have
no
trouble
recommending
jopen
bokbier
to
lovers
of
the
style
as
well
as
to
those
who
may
still
be
on
the
fence
very
sweet
malt
aroma
holds
dates
fig

tan
head
sweet
syrupy
malt
fore
tastes
of
crusty
dark

bread
raisin

very

a
dubbel
style
beer
dude
theres
like
chunks
in
my
beer
dont
know
if
i
should
rate
it
a
five
or
a
one
but
this
is
definitely
interesting
literally
large
floating
totally
unappatizing
chunks
of
yeast
hopefully
swirl
around
in
this
beer
other
than
that
its
a
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
with
nice
retention
smell
is
really
lively
and
all
over
the
place
big
fruity
malts
and
almost
a
belgianinspired
spiceyness
taste
is
much
the
same
banana
bread
apples
and
oranges
backed
by
a
sweet
maltiness
cloves
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
also
a
slight
hoppy
spicyness
really
interesting
almost
a
tangy
finish
thought
this
would
be
a
little
slicker
in
texture
due
to
the
appearance
but
its
actually
pretty
light
and
jumpy
on
the
palate
this
is
a
crazy
beer
altogether
one
ill
definitely
be
interested
to
try
again
on
the
light
side
of
mediumbodied
a
good
beer
but
it
gets
a
bit
harsh
as
it
warms
up
well
this
is
the
most
unique
bock
ive
ever
had
quite
an
experience
and
for
the
most
part
a
good
one
i
could
do
with
a
little
less
yeast
though
it
was
kind
of
nasty
not
too
big
of
a
deal
though
this
beer
is
good
where
it
counts
took
quite
a
while
to
finish
this
one
as
its
palate
barely
precedes
its
body
wow
a
fantastic
toffee
flavor
with
some
hazelnut
and
vanilla
a
very
smooth
graceful
mouthfeel
quite
a
good
brew
a
random
happening
that
i
shall
not
soon
forget
dark
crimson
tone
big
hefty
light
tan
head
retention
is
very
good
i
worried
about
overcarbonation
from
the
looks
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
bready
but
pretty
subdued
my
fears
come
to
fruition
when
i
taste
this
gaseous
concoction
of
a
beer
thats
one
of
my
biggest
pet
peaves
a
gaseous
mouthfeel
the
flavors
are
not
that
great
either
stale
bread
must
some
malts
and
some
spiciness
like
a
little
cinamon
type
of
flavor
all
in
all
though
this
isnt
enjoyable
flopping
around
on
bursts
of
bubbles
the
sediment
in
this
one
looked
like
miniature
mushrooms
i
wasnt
enthused
but
i
got
past
it
very
spicy
allspice
or
sumac
or
cinnamon
or
all
of
the
above
prunes
bananas
dates
and
3dayold
sugared
strawberries
round
out
a
very
sweet
and
fruity
aroma
fruit
jelly
impressions
of
chocolate
pumpernickel
bread
and
wait
for
it
candied
apples
pretty
sweet
most
of
the
way
through
this
somehow
manages
to
clean
up
nicely
a
strange
little
thing
but
very
worth
your
time
smelling
this
is
like
christmas
for
your
nose
not
like
any
other
bock
i
have
tasted
not
really
like
anything
else
enjoyable
but
confusing
perhaps
four

seemed
a
bit
off
this
hazy

beer
has
a
huge

so
big
that
i
would
think
the

would

it

some

taste
has
that
lager
yeast
thing
going
for
it

not
my

about
the

of
a
peaty

aftertaste
in

comes

very
herbal

tea
crumpets
a
little
chewy
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
was
a
bock
and
i
just
have
some
bias
against
them
even
the
great
ones
im
just
not
down
with
i
think
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
is
wonderful
which
most
do
not
so
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
if
youre
a
bock
guy
i
think
this
beer
is
good
enough
for
people
making
a
gateway
step
the
alcohol
and
yeast
are
just
little
detractors
for
me
the
aroma
was
your
classic
malty
bock
nice
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
aromas
mixed
in
with
a
good
earthy
tone
the
flavor
followed
through
very
closely
with
a
nice
bitter
malty
flavor
and
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
in
it
as
well
carbonation
that
is
more
then
decent
never
let
it
go
flat
and
kept
you
entertained
throughout
the
session
this
is
a
drinkable
bock
its
not
anything
that
will
blow
you
away
but
its
a
descent
example
of
the
style
drinkability
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
too
worthy
of
a
try
overall
it
is
a
very
good
lager
aside
from
the
meaty
flavor
a
bit
sweet
but
overall
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
for
its
strength
i
must
say
though
i
think
i
like
the
02
better
though
it
seemed
very
corny
to
me
drinkability
is
ok
i
could
put
a
few
of
them
back
but
not
as
drinkable
as
id
like
a
6pack
beer
to
be
abv
is
a
bit
high
for
a
session
but
i
normally
dont
have
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
anyway
the
glass
welcomes
an
ambertinted
light
brown
capped
by
a
quickly
shy
bit

nose
is

im
glad
its

to

runnin
round
as
the

twins
wanted
dead
or
alive
they
still
ride
that
come
crashin
into
tasty
town
i
dont
know
who
named
the
place
but
who
the
hell
cares
i
mean
theres
only
a
handful
o
residents
anyway
a
good
amount
of
lace
comes
rollin
cross
the
glass
boulevard
as
the
offee
twins
proceed
to
ransack
the
town
or
at
least
thats
what
the
sensationalist
press
wants
us
to
believe
in
truth
the
twins
are
cleanin
up
the
town
gettin
rid
o
the
nastier
elements
of
society
unsurprisingly
a
clean
though
decidedly
twininfused
finish
results
the
proper
end
to
the
smooth
ride
the
townsfolk
all
witnessed
out
their
windows
as
they
leave
the
people
of
tasty
town
all
glare
at
the
sunset
before
them
hoping
that
the
twins
return
sooner
rather
than
later
only
time
will
tell
folks
tasty
and
easy
drinking
more
than
1
is
not
a
problem
i
generally
dont
favor
lagers
too
much
notable
exceptions
excluded
but
i
dig
this
one
and
get
a
sixer
or
two
whenever
it
comes
around
good
choice
here
really
enjoy
the
ltd
series
from
full
sail
they
do
a
bang
up
job
d
a
very
good
bock
that
comes
together
well
with
herbal
hops
complementing

a
balanced

drinkability
very
drinkable
i
find
the
malty
acidic
crisp
bocks
pleasing
to
nearly
all
beer
lovers
its
a
safe
bet
when
theres
company
and
you
dont
know
what
type
of
beer
everybody
likes
it
has
a
nice
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
it
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
perfect
for
spring
time
in
my
opinion
drinkability
high
drinkability
on
this
one
for
sure
d
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
hurts
it
some
otherwise
it
has
a
good
taste
that
im
enjoying
d
this
was
a
decent
if
not
spectacular
bock
an
overall
solid
pickup
d
full
sail
kills
it
when
it
comes
to
lagers
and
their
ltd
series
is
some
of
the
best
american
lagers
i
have
had
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
bringing
to
a
summer
bbq
i
wish
they
would
distribute
to
the
midwest
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
d
very
sessionable
pleasant
lager
from
those
old
hippie
windsurfers
great
job
on
making
a
solidcomplex
but
sessionable
lager
absolutely
one
to
try
but
probably
not
one
for
the
record
books
this
beer
has
a
great
taste
and
is
incredibly
drinkable
but
its
appearance
was
very
disappointing
head
disappears
in
seconds
and
there
is
no
lace
but
do
not
let
that
get
you
down
too
much
because
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
how
it
should
be
on
the
label
it
says
it
is
trying
to
be
an
easy
drinking
lager
and
it
succeeded
for
a
dollar
a
beer
i
dont
think
you
can
get
anything
that
tastes
better
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
i
will
be
looking
for
2
could
use
more
of
these
solid
lagers
around
get
this
if
you
can
find
it
still

great

has

just

looks

smell
from
the
brew

fresh
taste
of

with
some
grassy
hops
underneath
a
little
malt
dominated
but
i
like
the
balance
in
my
opinion
they
got
the
levels
of
carbonation
right
and
a
little
heft
to
the
mouth
feel
goes
down
smooth
and
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
in
fact
i
just
might
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
second
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
molasses
and
caramelized
malt
it
smells
more
like
a
scotch
ale
than
a
bock
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
it
is
nice
but
very
one
dimensional
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
way
too
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
easily
forgettable
beer
pretty
nice
beer
with
a
lovely
maltiness
that
is
just
right
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
nice
head
that
sticks
around
as
a
cap
smells
firmly
malty
with
toffee
and
some
earthy
hops
the
taste
has
more
of
that
firm
malt
nutty
and
toffeelike
while
maintaining
a
nice
dry
profile
delicious
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
in
my
book
this
is
a
nice
solid
beer
for
what
it
is
and
a
bit
better
than
most
have
rated
it
nice
pleasant
surprise
i
could
almost
make
a
comment
that
it
could
pass
as
an
herbal
ale
oh
and
the
foam
completely
disappeared
halfway
through
the
session
so
appearance
could
use
some
improvement
drinkability
recommended
rather
enjoyable
and
a
pleasant
surprise
i
could
cheerfully
clear
through
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
better
than
average
beer
i
can
see
myself
going
for
a
few
more
of
these
tonight
d
i
would
go
for
this
again
if
on
tap
or
a
fresh
version
although
i
wont
get
that
chance
since
im
on
the
east
coast
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
bock
or
a
lager
as
the
label
and
the
beer
style
listed
differ
but
i
would
lean
towards
a
bock
more
overall
kinda
a
disappointment
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
body
and
character
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
winter
warmers
if
you
are
starting
to
look
toward
spring
im
not
much
on
the
style
but
i
think
this
might
actually
be
better
from
a
pint
glass
d
though
its
not
too
sweet
by
itself
i
think
the
sweetness
would
keep
me
from
having
more
than
a
couple
d
a
solid
bock
nothing
extraordinary
but
definitely
worth
a
try
for
the
lager
lover
or
someone
in
the
mood
for
a
winterspring
beer
i
probably
wont
buy
this
in
the
bottle
again
but
will
consider
another
try
if
it
is
on
tap
pours
ruby
red
and
clear
with
a
nice
small
white
covering
sticky
spare
lacing
looks
fine
smells
malty
and
unassuming
taste
is
a
nice
big
biscuity
malt
goodness
mostly
clean
flavor
though
i
do
get
a
hint
of
buttery
diacetyl
sp
maltiness
complemented
by
a
touch
of
grassy
hop
very
smooth
and
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
minimal
carbonation
and
small
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
last
smell
of
maple
syrup
toasted
malts
and
faint
grassy
hops
tastes
similar
to
a
scottish
ale
minimal
hops
big
on
the
toasted
biscuity
malts
that
linger
nicely
weighted
medium
body
overall
quite
enticing
cheers
i
like
very
much
and
it
may
be
just
as
christmasy
as
a
winter
ale
overall
a
very
well
made
and
drinkable
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
brown
color
the
nose
is
toasted
malts
chocolate
with
hints
of
citrus
and
yeast
the
taste
is
a
fuller
body
but
watery
at
times
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
dunkel
more
like
an
amber
lager
with
some
hops
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
question
its
style
d
drinks
easy
and
a
little
better
than
average
feel
i
find
this
an
interesting
brew
for
a
bock
hops
hit
harder
than
the
malts
at
times
the
malts
are
nice
and
pose
with
a
sweeter
character
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
toasty
caramel
quality
a
hint
of
burnt
caramel
and
raisin
its
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
with
some
body
but
for
me
its
a
little
too
soft
and
lacks
depth
and
complexity
it
has
a
faint
bite
mostly
of
burntcaramel
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
its
drinkable
but
pretty
flat
in
character
with
a
flat
finish
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
body
of
this
beer
is
mediumfull
with
delicate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
nothing
outstanding
about
the
beers
feel
and
body
it
works
well
for
the
beer
and
it
is
to
be
expected
that
it
have
good
feel
being
a
craft
beer
still
nothing
wowing
that
makes
me
want
to
give
it
a

not

to
buy

head

still
a

of

ends
up
on
the

theres
some
malts
and
fruits
in
the
aroma
and
an
overall
fresh
air
kind
of
smell
which
isnt
necessarily
bad
first
off
theres
a
hint
of
a
sweet
fruity
flavor
kind
of
floral
with
a
smooth
caramel
maltiness
following
some
brown
sugar
which
could
be
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
mixed
in
but
not
much
very
clean
a
mild
caramel
flavor
lurks
in
the
aftertaste
the
label
refers
to
this
as
easy
drinking
and
they
arent
kidding
its
really
almost
too
easy
drinking
and
smooth
not
the
strongest
flavor
but
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
quite
solid
also
its
not
expensive
either
so
could
be
a
great
candidate
for
a

of

released
by

though
its
style
is
not

on

a

with

confirmed
the
style
as
a

bock
the

includes

on

for

and
includes
another

they

nice

cute

meh
a
very
good
interpretation
of
a
traditional
bock
towards
a
doppelbock
strong
yet
drinkable
a
great
brew
especially
if
you
want
a
sweet
brew
o
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
of
a
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
the
creaminess
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
real
tasty
bock
one
of
the
best
single
bocks
i
have
had
would
recommend
to
anyone
into
malt
forward
brews
overall
very
solid
bock
beer
a
very
strong
carameltoffee
presence
but
good
bitter
balance
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
i
would
have
it
again
o
pretty
decent
o
a
light
and
sweet
bock
fragrant
and
smooth
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
amazing
tropical
smell
pear
juice
blended
with
dates
and
apple
juice
very
sweet
flavour
chocolate
apple
juice
with
raisins
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
at
4
bucks
a
bottle
what
a
nice
surprise
o
there
are
better
bock
beers
out
there
leave
it
on
the
shelf
o
a
surprisingly
nice
bock
from
poland
usually
bocks
are
only
this
nice
if
they
come
from
germany
od
i
could
have
about
two
before
it
got
old
a
good
beer
and
much
better
than
expected
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
just
not
much
depth
but
a
good
sesher
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
with
a
dense
34
tan
head
smell
is
very
potent
and
really
jumped
out
at
me
it
smells
strongly
of
raisins
and
maple
syrup
the
taste
seemed
pretty
complex
to
me
at
different
moments
i
got
flavors
of
raisin
caramel
and
barley
toward
the
end
of
the
sip
there
is
an
odd
bitterness
that
i
cannot
describe
but
it
didnt
really
sit
well
with
me
the
thickness
of
this
beer
is
close
to
doppel
territory
carbonation
in
this
beer
is
pretty
light
overall
this
beer
was
fun
and
different
but
didnt
really
impress
me
that
much
i
am
still
in
search
of
a
bock
i
can
really
call
my
favorite
picked
up
a
half
liter
at
euromarket
in
queens
its
a
rich
bready
bock
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
doppel
but
theres
a
very
unpleasant
astringent
bitterness
in
the
background
that
really
throws
this
off
otherwise
theres
a
tasty
mix
of
crust
marmalade
sweet
biscuits
and
caramel
what
a
shame
d
too
metallic
its
like
they
brew
in
a
copper
stave
mouthfeel
is
confusingly
thin
slightly
dry
too
onesided
on
the
sweetness
for
me
to
really
think
its
all
that
drinkable
this
is
not
a
lager
of
longievity
in
that
it
has
a
rich
fullness
in
the
intial
few
sips
but
quickly
depreciates
as
you
sip
the
look
is
nice
great
amber
clear
with
a
dough
head
nose
of
stale
apples
and
toastiness
and
a
bit
of
smoke
but
the
smoke
tastes
as
if
it
was
burnt
is
that
malt
volume
quality
the
feel
is
astringent
when
i
would
expect
something
rather
smooth
its
got
a
bitter
finish
that
has
a
mild
acidic
leather
smoke
which
brings
forth
the
mineral
like
qualities
but
still
on
standard
of
european
quality
not
a
bad
beer
super
drinkable
for
the
abv
d
slightly
bittersweet
owing
to
the
mix
of
burnt
flavours
and
the
sweeter
fruity
stuff
this
definitely
has
some
characteristics
of
a
bock
but
for
me
the
taste
is
somewhere
between
those
typical
darker
flavours
of
that
style
and
those
of
a
bière
de
garde
nice
change
either
way
and
interesting
to
drink
not
bad
nor
extraordinary
pretty
middleoftheroad
bock
thats
worth
checking
out
if
you
happen
across
it
but
nothing
worth
going
out
of
the
way
to
find
ive
given
better
ratings
to
worse
beers
the
numbers
fall
a
little
short
here
somehow
cheers
maybe
if
you
were
all
in
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
and
discussed
this
beer
you
could
make
it
something
to
be
proud
of
thanks
matt
my
first
polish
beer
d
an
ok
beer
but
only
in
small
quantities
this
polish
deliciously
is
very
good
nice
smell
fruity
caramel
the
head
dissipates
fast
but
is
steady
good
taste
sweet
malt
characteristic
backed
by
the
essence
of
caramel
subtle
notes
of
chocolate
bitterness
for
a
bock
beer
this
beer
is
sort
of
rogue
having
so
much
sweet
characteristics
and
even
though
most
bocks
go
well
with
meat
this
beer
pairs
well
with
polish
pastries
which
might
explain
the
sweetness
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
polish
beers
i
have
up
there
with
zywiec
warka
strong
tyskie
and
okocim
not
a
bad
bock
second
time
ive
had
it
but
probably
wont
pick
it
up
again
d
the
disgusting
smell
and
cloying
sweetness
make
this
one
pretty
undrinkable
im
about
a
quarter
of
the
way
through
and
probably
will
drain
pour
it
before
it
is
half
finished
thankfully
i
only
paid
75
cents
for
this
quite
good
glad
i
found
it
a
really
drinkable
bock
with
great
favour
and
very
nice
mouthfeel
the
appearance
is
nice

a
bock

auburn
at
the
edges

subsides

sweetness
almost

fairly

maybe
a
touch
too
syrupy
not
exactly
quaffable
but
good
in
small
sips
as
it
warms
pleasant
bready
aftertaste
some
dried
fruit
maybe
not
bad
but
it
didnt
really
hold
my
interest
an
average
beer
but
very
drinkable
taste
is
of
wheat
brown
sugar
roasted
malt
some
caramel
ends
on
the
dry
side
overall
this
is
one
amazing
bock
and
easy
to
drink
i
am
starting
to
grow
on
the
style
and
this
one
tops
many
if
not
all
that
i
have
had
if
you
happen
to
visit
poland
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
drinkable
yes
though
given
other
choices
id
keep
moving
along
mouthfeel
is
more
on
the
light
side
and
the
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
overall
i
am
very
satisfied
with
this
one
it
feels
more
flavourful
and
refreshing
than
some
german
bocks
i
have
tried
recently
goes
down
very
easy
a
real
pleasant
surprise
i
dont
know
how
well
this
fits
in
style
definitions
but
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
would
definitely
buy
it
again
drinkability
would
make
a
great
session
beer
for
a
bock
lover
one
of
my
better
nonbalticporter
finds
while
out
drinking
in
poland
drinkability
if
you
like
a
sweet
beer
this
one
is
for
you
me
not
so
much
overall
nothing
that
original
and
not
a
good
example
of
a
bock
but
since
my
expectations
were
low
i
was
not
disappointed
this
is
a
perfectly
drinkable

grabbed
a

of

while
i
was
in

it
poured
a
nice
dark

color
and
had
good
notes

and
some

the
head
was
an
attractive
tan

that
while
small
had
great

taste
was
smooth
and
evenly

not
as
much
malt
as
i
expected
from

strong
amber

this
is
like
a
dopplebock
meets
amber
ale
which
i
think
was
the
brewers
intentions
so
good
it
certainly
works
lots
of
caramel
malt
to
round
out
the
edges
no
bad
aftertaste
tasty
light
bodied
great
drinking
bock
would
certainly
serve
as
a
good
crossover
beer
this
is
almost
as
nice
as
its
dopplebock
counterpart
of
a
similar
name
somewhat
limited
but
well
achieved
and
well
rounded
quite
good
a
little
disappointing
after
the
nice
aroma
too
highly
carbonated
in
my
opinion
it
takes
away
from
what
should
be
a
very
smooth
character
also
it
isnt
really
all
that
malty
its
certainly
not
bad
but
i
think
i
would
have
rather
brought
home
a
zywiec
porter
or
something
more
enjoyable
though
worth
a
try
if
youre
over
there
o
this
isnt
necessarily
an
outstanding
beer
but
it
has
its
good
points
bumpy
in
spots
but
drinkable
overall
bocks
are
starting
to
be
an
awesome
style
this
one
is
borderline
doppelbock
but
still
a
good
bock
i
like
it
a
lot
the
normal
stuff
down
lets
take
on
the
other
bottle
from
the
gift
set
eh
it
pours
a
clear
topazgarnet
topped
by
a
halffinger
at
best
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
dry
caramel
mild
maple
syrup
light
flowers
and
a
touch
of
straight
barley
for
effect
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
a
distinct
vein
of
mild
stonefruits
makes
it
way
through
the
din
every
now
and
again
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mostly
fluid
feel
overall
a
nice
little
bock
nothing
special
but
digable
very
good
bock
complex
and
flavorful
i
almos
felt
like
eating
prunes
and
figs
but
still
with
some
refreshing
hops
not
to
make
it
a
sugar
bomb
ps
it
ages
well
the
tase
is
heavy
very
sweet
caramel
toffe
with
a
roasted
bitter
finish
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
body
is
overly
syrupy
o
the
unfiltered
and
unpasteurized
nature
of
this
beer
lends
some
complexities
to
the
taste
and
makes
this
an
interesting
beer
to
sample
i
found
the
drinkability
to
be
a
lot
better
compared
to
other
beers
in
this
style
especially
since
it
wasnt
as
fullbodied
or
malty
compared
to
other
bocks
the
alcohol
is
also
well
hidden
from
the
taste
o
disappointing
couldnt
finish
it
too
penetrant
o
bocks
are
new
to
me
but
this
one
really
seems
to
be
missing
something
hazy
with
little
head
bottle
is
a
swingtop
and
opens
to
little
fanfare
smell
is
malty
and
yeasty
with
light
raison
notes
the
taste
is
yeasty
with
milk
chocolate
dates
and
raisons
the
mouthfeel
is
sticky
and
slightly
well
chewy
finishes
sticky
with
nice
lingering
yeasty

a
good
beer
but
not
my

bock
deep

light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
feels
smooth
but
thin
one
and
done
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
some
warmth
from
the
booze
pretty
lackluster
overall
i
was
really
disappointed
in
the
look
of
this
beer
it
was
completely
lifeless
the
taste
started
out
a
little
harsh
but
in
the
end
the
flavour
wasnt
half
bad
its
a
decent
winter
warmersipper
i
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
however
poured
a
murky
burgundy
unfilitered
and
almost
resembled
prune
juice
finger
or
so
of
creamy
mocha
head
no
lace
and
mild
retention
nose
has
some
earthy
and
toffee
malts
hints
of
smoke
lots
of
grape
juice
sugary
and
sweet
taste
has
more
malt
yet
some
drying
bitterness
from
some
mild
hopping
ill
guess
a
bit
of
some
awkward
interplay
between
the
components
and
almost
vinous
in
some
aspect
not
in
a
completely
positive
way
slight
note
of
alcohol
in
the
midmouth
sweet
and
sticky
yet
dry
in
the
finish
decent
mouthfeel
with
medium
body
and
carbonation
alright
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
tangy
sour
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
goes
down
remarkably
well
given
the
abv
though
it
was
slow
to
get
started
ill
revisit
an
aged
one
next
year
d
well
this
is
quite
the
malt
bomb
a
good
bedtime
sipper
but
not
one
thats
easily
consumed
very
bready
and
rich
overall
despite
the
hohum
aroma
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
if
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
repeat
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
deep
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
medium
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
heavily
caramelized
malt
with
light
brown
sugar
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
heavy
caramel
malt
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
more
residual
sugar
then
i
had
expected
body
is
quite
full
with
medium
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
heavier
and
sweeter
then
expected
though
still
very
enjoyable
drinkability
i
simply
picked
this
beer
up
on
a
nice
bottle
appearance
and
quite
happy
it
turned
out
this
is
a
nice
winter
beer
that
offers
a
well
balanced
taste
d
very
nice
bock
here
nothing
wrong
at
all
and
i
could
have
a
few
regardless
of
the
abv
i
cant
tell
its
so
high
masked
well
delicious
d
honestly
with
the
sweetnessheaviness
i
cant
see
having
more
than
one
of
these
plus
the
flavour
is
just
not
that
interesting
d
i
would
never
purchase
this
one
again
perhaps
its
average
for
the
style
but
i
just
wasnt
a
fan
of
it
i
dont
want
to
be
too
harsh
because
it
does
offer
flavours
consistent
with
the
style
but
i
struggled
with
it
and
ended
up
pouring
some
out
d
interesting
bock
id
buy
it
again
worth
a
try
but
not
really
memorable
a
decent
bock
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
others
ive
sampled
this
year
nor
is
it
the
best
from
this
brewer
i
enjoyed
their
nobel
a
great
deal
there
wasnt
anything
offensive
about
it
it
drank
pretty
well
but
it
wasnt
fantastic
overall
a
decent
bock
but
not
one
i
would
consider
buying
again
it
possesses
most
of
the
staple
characteristics
of
the
style
but
nothing
stands
out
that
would
make
me
want
to
grab
this
bock
from
another
one
the
shelf
at
the
same
time
i
liked
the
pronounced
grassy
feel
in
the
finish
that
i
havent
really
experienced
in
other
interpretations
of
the
style
before
maybe
it
was
the
low
carbonation
that
made
it
really
stick
out
in
the
end
id
say
its
worth
a
try
but
a
try
is
all
i
will
give
this
that
nifty
swingtop
bottle
wont
entice
me
again
pours
a
cloudy
reddishbrown
into
a
snifter
with
half
a
finger
of
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
bread
and
toffee
with
hints
of
fruit
and
fusel
alcohol
on
deep
whiffs
big
on
carameltoffee
malt
up
front
with
bread
raisins
and
perceptible
booziness
i
thought
this
beer
would
finish
much
sweeter
but
it
was
suprisingly
crisp
with
a
light
bitterness
creamy
mouthfeel
a
tad
chewy
but
nice
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
those
high
abv
beers
that
seemingly
completely
hides
its
strength
but
it
is
a
decent
sipper
although
pales
in
comparison
to
most
others
in
its
bracket
pours
a
murky
amberbrown
colour
with
thin
white
head
faint
hints
of
lacing
and
poor
head
retention
smells
of
raisin
cherry
and
sweet
brown
sugar
some
small
alcohol
notes
flavour
is
boozy
and
sweet
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
low
thin
body
ok
beer
just
a
little
bit
too
boozy
munich
and
vienna
malts
are
a
brewers
best
friends
ive
never
met
a
single
beer
drinker
who
doesnt
love
the
toasty
grainy
lightly
spicy
and
tremendously
rich
flavour
of
these
german
malts
likewise
people
are
easily
astonished
by
the
amount
of
fruity
zesty
intensity
and
complexity
inspired
by
phenolic
and
estery
yeasts
combine
the
two
and
you
have
one
seriously
distinctive
easily
agreeable
and
highly
impressionable
beer
poured
a
light
brown
colour
with
hints
of
amber
coming
through
no
head
or
lacing
at
all
it
smells
of
malt
dark
fruit
and
caramel
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
its
very
sweet
up
front
but
opened
up
to
reveal
a
alcohol
burn
with
a
dry
finish
not
bad
i
guess
its
quite
syrupy
and
feels
quite
thick
on
the
palate
overall
i
thought
this
was
ok
most
christoffel
beers
are
decent
at
best
and
this
is
one
of
them
overall
a
solid
offering
i
tried
this
beer
on
january
16
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
tancoloured
head
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
and
candy
sugar
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
malty
slightly
grassy
with
a
bitter
finish
great
winter
bock
and
my
second
favorite
offering
from
this
great
artisan
lager
brewer
poured
a
deep
chesnut
brown
with
a
half
finger
off
white
head
that
is
quick
to
vanish
leaving
no
lace
bhind
a
nice
mix
of
roasted
chesnutdark
fruitand
leafy
hop
in
the
noseeverything
seems
to
meld
well
together
there
are
some
good
malt
accented
flavors
but
it
seems
to
be
missing
somethingroasted
nuts
along
with
some
raisin
flavors
start
out
well
but
it
seems
to
have
an
abrubt
endingnot
as
chewey
as
i
would
like
either
its
not
a
bad
bock
beer
it
just
needs
something
in
the
finish
to
make
it
complete
draught
at
churckey
black
with
just
a
bit
of
light
sneaking
through
small
light
tan
head
that
rapidly
disappears
leaving
slight
lacing
aroma
of
feet
in
sweatsocks
very
odd
taste
is
much
more
pleasant
starting
with
burnt
caramel
and
progressing
to
raisins
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
decent
enough
d
no
go
i
have
a
problem
with
the
sugar
content
overall
this
is
a
very
simple
brew
in
terms
of
flavors
not
too
much
present
but
very
drinkable
almost
a
session
beer
simply
the
best
as
i
often
say
one
of
the
better
bock
beer
we
tried
during
our
bockbeertaste
evening
d
a
decent
bock
nothing
super
special
but
good
d
very
drinkable
boch
good
flavor
and
balanced
maybe
it
was
beacuse
i
was
drinking
this
out
of
a
long
and
rather
tall
glass
the
beer
dissapeared
on
me
the
slight
cinamon
and
realy
that
is
all
you
need
to
make
a
noticeable
impression
drew
me
in
from
the
first
sip
and
would
not
let
me
go
even
after
the
last
drop
was
gone
conclusion
a
nice
dopplebock
with
wonderful
aroma
and
nice
fruitforward
flavors
the
dark
fruit
sweet
dark
malt
and
hoppy
finish
are
balanced
together
wonderfully
my
only
real
complaint
here
is
that
i
wish
there
was
just
a
little
more
carbonationslightly
heartier
mouthfeel
overall
another
great
beer
from
christoffel
again
the
bottle
size
does
put
me
off
and
i
feel
that
it
would
be
better
with
toned
down
earthiness
but
i
was
glad
to
give
this
one
a
go
thanks
bobsy
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
good
bock
you
could
definately
drink
this
with
a
meal
or
just
while
hanging
out
if
you
can
find
it
its
worth
checking
out
pours
a
dark
colour
with
some
whitish

sweet

malty
sweety

choc
cocoa
milky
caramel
mouthfeel
sugar
present
maybe
a
bit
of
roast
fine
one
but
one
dimensional
sweet
high
alcohol
dessert
for
supper
really
but
good
to
try
this
rare
one
a
solid
example
and
an
enjoyable
beer
it
goes
towards
a
german
bock
instead
of
a
dutch
bock
sampled
the
bokbierdag
in
zutphen
new
bock
in
2005
and
liking
the
blond
so
much
made
me
sample
this
one
as
a
2
beer
that
day
nice
head
and
a
dark
brown
and
clear
beer
nose
is
some
caramel
malt
and
lots
of
old
vegetables
hardly
any
yeastarome
but
missing
most
the
great
hopnose
the
blond
has
taste
is
good
giving
sweet
caramellic
taste
without
having
the
feeling
it
is
sweetened
and
some
hoppiness
imo
missing
a
litle
roast
and
hops
to
make
it
into
a
good
one
but
taste
is
quiet
clean
unfresh
nose
is
imo
the
only
problem
with
this
brew
as
it
is
further
ok
having
good
carbonisation
and
a
blanced
taste
well
drinkable
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
dutch
bokbeers
no
doubt
the
best
beer
produced
in
mexico
with
negra
modelo
being
second
with
a
bit
of
distance
between
the
two
wish
it
was
available
all
year
round
but
then
it
wouldnt
be
this
special
a
must
try
during
the
holidays
i
am
not
saying
its
the
best
beer
i
ever
had
simply
that
they
pack
a
lot
of
fullness
and
flavor
in
a
beautifully
wrapped
little
bottle
and
in
a
perfect
balance
for
me
merry
christmas
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
local
brewery
in
cabo
san
lucas
i
recall
drinking
this
beer
before
my
craft
days
thinking
that
it
was
some
sort
of
dark
god
how
times
have
changed
this
reddish
brown
concoction
may
stand
out
a
bit
in
a
landscape
of
yellow
fizzy
beach
brews
but
is
an
average
bock
at
best
below
average
truth
be
told
does
show
some
light
tan
head
but
with
a
curiously
fizzy
thin
body
and
an
aroma
that
is
strangely
alcoholforward
boozy
and
medicinal
rather
than
richly
sweet
and
fruity
although
i
do
get
a
whiff
of
cherry
cough
syrup
the
flavor
is
devoid
of
clear
roasted
or
chocolate
elements
there
are
some
cherry
sultana
raisin
and
peach
notes
poking
out
here
and
there
along
with
a
brown
sugar
backbone
that
somehow
manages
to
underperform
compared
to
a
brew
like
negra
modelo
i
am
having
to
pay
too
much
attention
to
taste
the
fruit
notes
and
im
simply
not
getting
the
big
dark
molasses
flavor
others
are
claiming
like
a
mexican
shiner
bock
finish
is
on
the
grainy
and
medicinal
side
its
not
awful
but
i
think
ill
refrain
from
buying
a
12pack
next
time
taste
is
nice
sweet
toffee
caremlised
bread
hint
of
wine
up
front
drier
toasty
finish
light
leafywoody
finish
it
has
a
bit
of
a
basic
massproduced
quality
but
it
is
very
good
fullbodied
in
character
and
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
spritzy
and
tastes
like
club
soda
dark
amber
color
in
the
glass
the
typical
wet
cardboard
smell
from
the
bottle
into
a
plastic
cup
at
the
neighborhood
street
celebration
at
least
i
still
have
my
memories
d
an
ex
left
me
this
beer
it
was
better
than
i
expected
dont
fear
drinking
this
but
dont
seek
it
out
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
mostly
because
the
store
by
my
house
sells
it
for
3
99
a
sixpack
not
the
best
bock
out
there
but
not
bad
for
south
of
a
south
of
the
border
bock
flavors
of
medium
sweet
malts
minerals
citrus
water
more
malt
than
light
mexican
beer
have
certainly
but
light
compared
to
christmas
holiday
beers
or
as
it
says
estilo
bock
all
in
all
compared
to
the
big
beers
i
drink
i
would
call
this
a
session
brew
with
slight
caramel
malt
body
overall
a
pretty
decent
bock
a
nice
surprise
one
last
note
this
beer
is
brewed
in
one
of
my
favorite
cities
monterrey
nl
mexico
o
mild
inoffensive
and
unimpressive
definitely
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
adjunctdextrin
tastes
spoil
what
may
have
had
some
potential
overall
a
decent
bock
beer
nothing
special
but
relatively
well
made
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
the
overly
sugary
aftertaste
detracts
for
me
makes
me
think
adjunct
cheers
a
reasonably
drinkable
flavorful
bock
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
worth
a
try
overall
i
hate
to
make
promises
but
this
one
is
at
minimum
satisfying
not
great
not
bad
but
compliments
any
meal
regardless
of
style
drink
up
fellas
and
ladies
salud
o
this
is
one
of
the
least
offensive
beers
that
i
have
had
out
of
mexico
it
drinks
easy
and
the
taste
is
okay
id
put
it
with
negro
modelo
overall
this
isnt
bad
but
nothing
really
stands
out
as
being
special
therefor
it
falls
a
bit
short
of
being
worth
seeking
out
glad
i
got
my
bottles
for
free
pours
out
clear
dark
brown
with
red
hues
when
held
to
the
light
head
is
nice
thick
and
with
decent
retention
not
too
much
lacing
on
this
one
the
nose
is
grainy
with
a
mix
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
and
solid
malt
backbone
extremely
light
on
flavor
a
little
bit
of
grains
and
a
little
bit
of
metal
hops
are
almost
nonexistent
and
the
malts
have
vanished
mouth
feel
is
watery
at
best
with
hints
of
carbonation
this
beer
went
downhill
fast
never
will
i
buy
this
again
o
this
is
a
nice
bock
seems
different
than
most
german
bocks
and
less
sweet
than
american
ones
the
flavor
is
more
of
a
disappointment
it
shows
is
mexicaness
it
has
a
it
of
metal
herbal
notes
form
the
hops
some
muddled
sweetness
and
overall
not
that
great
d
very
drinkable
nothing
complex
but
inoffensive
and
about
what
you
would
expect
from
a
mexican
industrial
bock
little
head
on
this
one
and
no
real
lacing
on
a
light
amber
with
slight
golden
hues
hazy
body
aroma
is
mild
subtlety
spicy
and
earthy
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
brown
sugar
and
caramel
malt
intermixed
this
one
is
little
flat
to
me
with
light
carbonation
and
light
body
overall
very
drinkable
and
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
bock
made
on
mexico
and
actually
not
a
terrible
beer
though
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
efes
tulip
2011
vintage
pour
seems
quite
still
zero
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
crossed
with
overripe
banana
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
taste
is
not
offensive
but
really
nothing
exciting
reminds
me
of
a
stale
yuengling
more
than
a
bock
like
a
flat
amber
instead
of
a
bock
easy
to
drink
just
not
enjoyable
o
its
definitely
a
middle
of
the
road
easy
drinker
there
is
absolutely
nothing
about
it
that
stands
out
as
overly
bad
or
good
o
drinkable
when
icy
cold
but
really
not
a
very
good
beer
it
doesnt
seem
much
different
than
dos
equis
amber
o
sadly
this
is
revered
as
one
of
the
best
coming
from
mexico
so
be
it
o
decent
just
barely
good
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
and
a
foilwrapped
neck
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
t
slightly
sweet
malts
grainy
with
a
lightly
toasted
taste
medium
carbonation
with
large
bubbles
honestly
not
all
that
bad
d
serve
cold
with
lots
of
spicy
mex
food
overall
yet
another
bad
beer
that
the
mass
populous
love
i
cant
really
say
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
its
not
bad
but
not
something
i
plan
on
drinking
again
its
a
decent
thickness
with
low
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
easily
a
sessioanble
beer
even
though
its

o
unfortunately
the
nose
is
the
only
thing
with
german
influence
in
this
one
dont
get
me
wrong
being
born
and
raised
in
sd
i
have
a
major
weakness
for
mexibeer
and
this
one
really
just
is
a
good
mexibeer
and
not
much
more
right
up
there
and
maybe
even
nicer
than
victoria
another
mexican
classic
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
with
an
abv
of
5
9
i
might
actually
catch
a
buzz
which
isnt
easy
to
do
with
most
mexibeers
seems
solid
in
everything
other
than
smell
and
taste
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
that
the
pour
was
awesome
but
that
certain
metallic
taste
and
smell
seemed
to
keep
it
from
being
a
great
beer
heres
a
sleeper
from
a
mexican
brewing
giant
its
a
step
up
from
dos
equis
amber
but
noche
buena
is
only
around
during
the
winter
season
for
whatever
reason
this
is
the
first
ive
heard
tell
of
this
stuff
found
it
in
a
holiday
variety
24pack
along
with
both
types
of
dos
equis
it
is
light
bodied
for
the
style
which
is
what
youd
expect
from
a
mexican
dark
its
very
close
to
rival
negra
modelo
this
is
a
little
richer
and
roastier
the
negra
modelo
a
little
lighter
and
finishes
a
bit
cleaner
if
you
like
mexidarks
youll
like
this
just
fine
it
or
an
equivalent
dark
from
this
brewer
ought
to
be
available
yearround
im
somewhat
surprised
they
dont
really
have
anything
to
counter
the
modelo
unless
its
christmas
season
while
were
at
it
this
brewer
really
needs
to
get
the
bohemia
in
12packs
a
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
mexidark
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
2011
edition
this
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
light
some
malts
caramel
and
toffee
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
taste
is
similar
to
smell
light
toffee
malts
a
little
bitterness
and
carbonation
at
the
end
overall
i
wanted
to
rate
this
beer
higher
but
theres
just
not
that
outstanding
thing
in
it
im
looking
for
other
than
good
memories
of
times
spent
in
mexico
so
consider
this
a
sentimental
favourite
i
do
like
the
taste
and
if
i
could
find
it
here
in
six
or
twelve
packs
id
drink
it
a
lot
unfortunately
i
could
only
find
single
bottles
thin
and
watery
though
theres
a
vague
amount
of
flavor
here
flaked
oats
nutty
malts
though
unfortunately
theres
a
metallic
twang
to
the
finish
nothing
sweet
here
that
would
suggest
a
bock
though
there
are
some
vague
caramel
flavors
dry
papery
aftertaste
clean
finish
simple
and
easy
drinking
nothing
groundbreaking
worth
a
try
though
indio
is
a
far
better
beer
from
this
brewery
nose
is
clean
though
a
bit
thin
touch
of
ruddy
caramel
perhaps
a
bit
of
carob
and
a
hint
of
roast
no
real
hop
aroma
but
thats
just
as
well
given
the
light
malt
delivery
taste
is
smooth
and
light
finishing
with
a
lingering
yet
thin
caramel
roast
appears
briefly
after
the
swallow
along
with
a
bit
of
spice
overall
certainly
lighter
in
body
than
i
anticipated
but
quite
drinkable
and
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
things
interesting
light
caramel
sweetness
and
spiciness
on
the
finish
with
some
hops
emerging
with
warming
i
found
myself
just
waiting
for
this
beerish
drink
to
be
over
best
thing
i
can
say
is
that
it
worked
fine
as
part
of
a
marinade
for
chicken
thighs
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
appears
browntinted
amber
with
a
light
single
finger
of
loose
head
that
falls
down
to
a
loose
rim
of
foamy
scum
in
about
two
minutes
body
is
lighter
and
carbonation
is
quite
lively
on
the
tongue
aroma
has
this
grassy
herbal
feel
that
also
contains
hints
of
cinnamon
and
spice
spread
over
the
top
of
a
lightly
toasted
caramel
malt
taste
comes
across
as
a
lot
of
the
things
promised
in
the
nose
but
not
quite
as
strong
as
i
would
have
anticipated
from
the
nose
with
the
main
flavor
emphasis
up
front
on
the
spice
even
coming
across
as
understated
before
the
tongue
delves
into
the
malt
bill
compared
to
other
christmas
beers
i
have
had
it
is
rather
underspiced
but
compared
to
other
mexican
beers
it
is
amazing
pretty
good
overall
just
wish
it
were
amplified
somewhat
and
had
more
head
to
it
finishing
my
night
with
this
beer
how
appropriate
no
it
pours
a
clear
sunrise
garnet
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
roasted
malts
light
cocoa
powder
graham
crackers
and
biscuits
the
taste
holds
notes
of
caramel
light
mandarin
orange
syrup
honeydripped
biscuits
and
very
light
chocolate
powder
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
mostly
smooth
feel
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
not
a
spectacular
brew
by
any
stretch
but
a
very
drinkable
generally
enjoyable
one
not
bad
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
one
inch
white
head
that
settles
slower
than
expected
some
solid
lacing
smell
is
grass
lemon
sweet
malts
and
maybe
a
hint
of
pine
taste
is
all
of
that
with
a
little
breadyness
and
good
balance
body
is
thin
for
me
but
on
the
heavy
side
for
a
mexican
beer
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
very
easy
drinking
this
is
a
nice
tasting
beer
this
poured
out
as
a
typical
looking
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
head
fades
and
doesnt
leave
too
much
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
dark
malt
aromas
with
a
light
element
of
spice
in
there
the
taste
was
pretty
decent
actually
i
enjoyed
the
beers
hint
of
holiday
flavor
it
had
the
mouthfeel
was
drinkable
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
brew
wasnt
too
bad
nice
little
floral
hop
kick
with
a
fair
amount
of
toastycaramel
malt
i
dont
think
there
is
any
spice
additions
but
the
interaction
of
the
herbal
hop
and
toasted
malt
gives
it
almost
a
nutmegcinnamon
character
that
fits
well
with
the
beer
i
am
glad
to
see
a
mexican
brewery
delve
into
the
seasonal
beer
market
body
is
fairly
light
and
it
drinks
really
easy
i
am
contemplating
picking
up
another
12pack
of
this
before
christmas
rolls
around
especially
at
less
than
15
bucks
im
fairly
impressed
a
little
better
than
the
original
and
it
comes
in
12packs
which
is
kind
of
nice
look
for
it
at
your
local
bodega
medium
body
nice
carbonation
slightly
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
boring
bock
flavorwise
although
it
looked
and
felt
pretty
nice
drinkability
is
great
for
a
bock
i
am
not
normally
a
fan
of
bocks
as
they
seem
boring
to
me
however
judging
this
on
style
it
is
much
better
than
most
other
bocks
ive
had
o
an
above
average
bock
and
easily
my
favorite
mexican
beer
to
date
havent
yet
tried
bohemia
definitely
worth
it
if
youre
a
wholesale
club
member
and
you
can
get
the
dos
equis
holiday
sampler
on
the
cheap
the
aroma
is
rather
light
for
a
bock
its
malty
with
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
thankfully
has
more
to
it
bits
of
caramel
and
cinnamon
and
brown
sugar
the
body
is
light
for
a
bock
but
its
smooth
enough
id
have
it
again
and
is
probably
the
best
mexican
beer
ive
had
flavor
is
clearly
caramelrich
and
backed
by
toasted
cereal
grains
nothing
too
exciting
but
it
is
impressively
bocklike
for
a
mexican
beer
body
is
mediumthin
and
crisp
big
bubbles
of
carbonation
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
when
in
mexico
during
the
holidays
maybe
that
is
the
aura
that
surrounds
this
beer
the
fact
that
it
is
the
christmas
beer
into
a
pint
glass
this
presents
a
very
clear
and
deep
reddish
amber
color
under
a
thin
but
nicely
sustained
head
the
aroma
is
a
mild
but
noticeable
sweet
roasted
malt
nose
with
a
light
note
of
hops
theres
a
nice
sweet
roasted
malt
dominated
and
robust
body
here
carried
along
by
a
pleasant
medium
carbonation
into
a
caramel
noted
crisp
malt
finish
all
in
all
a
no
frills
but
solid
bock
gracias

overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
smooth
fairly
dry
sweetness
of
this
beer
making
me
quite
glad
that
my
initial
expectations
throwaway
offstyle
from
mexican
lager
factory
didnt
get
in
the
way
of
my
willingness
to
try
something
new
i
could
maybe
swallow
this
better
with
some
ritz
crackers
some
of
those
ugly
gift
basket
cheese
spreads
ive
been
gifted
over
the
holidays
but
then
i
wouldnt
have
any
ammo
left
to
pass
off
to
unwanted
guests
i
too
am
a
sucker
for
mexican
beers
so
i
was
at
cotco
and
picked
this
one
up
it
comes
in
a
24
pack
along
with
dos
equis
lager
regular
it
was
exceptional
i
think
i
am
a
fan
of
cuauhtemocs
dark
beers
they
brew
because
this
is
the
3rd
best
beer
ive
had
from
here
dark
but
smoooth
not
bad
and
certainly
better
than
negra
modelo
i
wish
this
beer
was
as
ubiquitous
as
that
when
i
went
out
to
mexican
restaurants
while
nothing
to
get
overly
excited
about
this
is
a
nicely
enjoyable
brew
that
i
would
be
happy
to
be
drinking
as
i
am
cooking
food
up
in
the
kitchen
which
is
exactly
what
i
happen
to
be
doing
at
the
moment
overall
pretty
good
stuff
and
a
nice
little
surprise
i
liked
it
it
didnt
take
me
off
to

glarus
dan
carey
is
a
brewing
genius
especially
when
it
comes
to
german
style
beer
which
is
no
surprise
considering
his
time
spent
across
the
pond
uffda
is
a
pretty
simple
bock
overall
but
its
lack
of
defect
and
flourishing
bready
and
nutty
malt
profile
make
it
damn
delicious
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
you
can
lay
lips
on
o
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
here
is
my
two
cents
b
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
bock
good
dark
toasty
malt
notes
with
a
decent
hop
backing
o
solid
brew
as
expected
from
ng
oa
run
of
the
mill
bock
the
malt
could
have
been
more
complex
but
a
decent
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
moderate
carbonation
and
medium
body
leave
this
smooth
soft
and
fluffy
this
is
a
wonderful
bock
that
i
would
consider
closer
to
a
doppelbock
than
a
bock
a
malty
delight
overall
bocks
are
tasting
more
delicious
every
time
i
try
one
i
enjoyed
every
sip
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
beer
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
body
with
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
slightly
foamy
14
and
smooth
34
mouthfeel
that
feels
right
for
the
beer
and
the
style
in
general
closes
dryly
with
moderate
to
heavy
stickiness
clinging
to
the
palate
uffda
pours
a
dark
brownish
color
with
a
small

there
is
a
sweet
bold
caramel
and
doughy
aroma

overall
a
rich
and
flaverfull
bock
overall
this
is
a
really
decent
bock
the
sweetness
is
not
over
the
top
like
other
bocks
can
be
this
one
does
not
disappoint
recommendation
pass
overall
a
very
easy
drinking
bock
that
has
some
great
levels
of
complexity
and
depth
the
sweetness
is
kept
in
balance
well
with
the
earthy
tones
o
this
is
a
really
good
bock
that
i
didnt
appreciate
and
drink
enough
off
when
it
was
part
of
ngs
regular
line
up
glad
theyre
bringing
this
back
on
a
seasonal
basis
well
made
lager
that
is
worth
seeking
out
holy
hell
this
is
amazing
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
bocks
but
this
is
a
bullseye
the
blend
of
toasted
and
sweet
malt
with
so
much
biscuit
delicious
and
floral
hops
fluttering
in
the
background
wow
o
very
nice
bock
malty
but
not
cloying
rich
but
drinkable
this
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
color
with
a
foamy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
filled
with
toasted
malts
the
taste
is
filled
with
grains
yeast
and
malts
making
it
very
wellbalanced
there
are
hints
of
oak
and
caramel
as
well
this
is
a
nice
rerelease
of
brew
that
i
never
had
the
chance
to
try
and
it
did
not
disappoint
o
this
one
might
have
been
better
when
it
was
fresh
just
a
one
man
show
here
now
the
roast
is
still
strong
with
minimal
sweetness
and
some
chocolate
notes
lingering
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
a
small
fizzy
white
head
that
disappeared
really
quickly
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
and
some
chocolate
hints
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
roasted
malt
and
very
deep
rich
chocolate
to
the
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
really
good
and
overall
is
a
good
bock
pours
chocolately
dark
brown
with
inch
of
whitetan
foam
slow
settling
hearty
malt
smell
all
malt
taste
mixture
of
chocolate
cola
vanilla
even
root
beer
fades
out
very
smooth
nothing
bitter
about
it
little
cloying
in
the
finish
but
chewy
to
get
there
nice
classic
bock
loads
of
malt
beer
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
but
definitely
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
tasty
beer
although
it
may
not
be
season
appropriate
beer
style
i
think
it
goes
nicely
with
the
cool
weather
good
beer
across
the
board
o
very
rich
caramel
and
dark
fruit
flavors
a
great
staple
bock
but
i
again
feel
this
beer
just
isnt
the
same
as
the
old
maybe
its
just
me
still
a
solid
beer
that
will
always
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
d
not
uberly
complex
but
i
could
drink
this
all
night
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
on
it
to
be
a
session
beer
but
i
could
definitely
take
down
a
six
pick
on
a
brisk
fall
night
bottle
from
reillys
in
madison
way
too
sweet
above
average
mouthfeel
drinkable
as
dessert
at
the
end
of
a
big
meal
but
not
something
i
was
able
to
finish
or
would
seek
out
again
maybe
thats
why
the
label
recommends
drinking
cold
if
you
dont
enjoy
the
sweetness
a
little
colour
yes
mahogoney
and
a
little
head
o
this
is
a
good
offer
from
new
glarus
a
solid
straight
forward
bock
overall
a
good
bock
not
my
favorite
style
or
new
glarus
offering
ill
tell
you
that
ng
is
doing
great
great
things
with
their
beers
and
even
more
so
with
their
specialty
beers
this
and
the
iipa
thumbprint
are
total
favorites
of
mine
and
i
wish
i
could
get
them
on
a
regular
basis
excellent
work
ng
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
bocks
but
this
is
a
good
one
overall
this
beer
isnt
one
of
new
glaruss
highlights
in
my
opinion
an
average
bock
do
ive
done
a
side
by
side
comparison
of
this
batch
and
the
newest
2011
batch
and
preferred
this
one
a
lot
more
flavorful
at
the
expense
of
a
notsopretty
appearance
in
conclusion
aging
uffda
for
3
years
is
a
worthwhile
experiment
thanks
for
the
trytick
taturbo
mouthfeel
is
on
the
fuller
side
but
its
not
chewy
or
tough
to
drink
a
full
glass
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
bocks
and
im
happy
to
see
it
back
in
rotation
o
this
isnt
too
hot
its
just
kind
of
there
another
winner
from
new
glarus
uff
da
was
a
common
expression
in
my
grandparents
household
and
consequently
the
beer
had
long
been
on
my
to
try
list
new
glarus
rarely
disappoints
but
really
enjoyed
this
one
o
this
is
a
great
brew
with
a
very
well
rounded
balance
good
from
start
to
finish
but
lacks
with
the
aroma
even
when
warmed
smooth
and
drinkable
with
solid
flavors
that
well
represent
the
style
maybe
ive
been
drinking
too
many
doppelbocks
of
late
but
this
one
seemed
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
for
a
bock
this
isnt
really
a
knock
just
an
observation
taste
mouthfeel
very
smooth
subtle
hoppiness
extremely
enjoyable
brew
even
went
well
with
a
small
piece
of
chocolate
i
had
to
try
it
and
is
on
the
list
of
beers
i
would
buy
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
bockstyle
beers
in
general
so
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
poured
a
dark
brown
with
nary
a
head
to
speak
of
smell
is
on
the
malty
caramel
side
of
things
the
taste
is
real
sweet
hints
of
cherries
vanilla
and
even
a
little
toffee
did
i
mention
this
was
sweet
overall
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
id
definitely
like
to
try
this
particular
beer
again
so
i
could
have
more
time
getting
familiar
with
the
subtle
nuances
present
definitely
recommend
this
o
this
beer
is
excellent
its
a
really
solid
rendition
of
the
style
its
not
pricey
and
its
fresher
than
most
germans
available
for
purchase
definitely
trumps
other
american
bocks
ive
had
i
dont
know
how
this
isnt
an
a
beer
dark
coppery
brown
reddish
highlights
feeble
skim
of
tan
foam
that
settles
quickly
with
splotchy
areas
on
the
surface
texture
is
smooth
and
the
foam
is
slightly
sticky
on
the
lips
sweet
and
malty
aroma
toasted
grains
and
an
indistinct
nuttiness
flavors
are
similar
malt
heavy
with
some
maple
sweetness
bitter

and
nutty
richness
toasty
grain
minor
dried

notes

caramel
body
is
medium
and
it
feels
somewhat
full

to
warm
as
the
label
advises
and
it
opens
up
a
bit
more
best
served
cool
and
not
cold
oi
picked
up
some
new
glarus
beers
when
i
was
in
milwaukee
a
few
weeks
ago
i
wasnt
impressed
with
the
unplugged
one
that
i
got
but
this
one
is
great
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
others
overall
a
good
bock
that
i
enjoyed
even
on
this
blistering
summer
day
recommend
i
dont
often
go
for
bocks
these
days
but
this
one
would
be
the
exception
not
avail
here
in
tx
good
in
goody
shipment
from
ummagum
if
avail
near
me
id
get
the
occasional
single
oo
o
a
pleasant
brew
a
nice
malt
bomb
id
definitely
have
another
overall
very
rich
and
flavorful
somewhat
unusual
choice
for
a
summer
seasonal
but
typically
well
done
this
is
a
decently
nicely
executed
doppelbockdukler
bock
but
it
is
nowhere
near
some
german
examples
overall
extremely
drinkable
closed
my
eyes
and
i
was
in
munich
on
the
first
sip
has
tons
of
bready
earthy
roasty
malt
character
in
each
sip
without
leaning
too
heavy
on
the
roastiness
semisweetness
is
entirely
coming
across
as
from
the
malts
there
are
also
some
heavy
dark
fruit
esters
present
in
the
nose
complementing
the
denseness
of
this
brew
quite
nicely
and
also
the
abv
is
well
hidden
i
cant
find
the
hotness
of
the
alcohol
anywhere
a
solid
hearty
brew
all
around
o
now
i
recall
why
i
dont
like
ng
calling
this
a
bock
it
has
too
much
roasted
malt
going
on
to
fit
the
character
expected
its
definitely
a
good
wellcrafted
and
delicious
beer
i
just
wish
there
was
more
bready
toasted
malt
character
say
as
in
the
two
women
lager
cheers
thick
thick
mouthfeel
with
no
apparent
carbonation
left
in
the
liquid
thanks
to
taturbo
for
this
one
in
a
trade
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
red
highlights
the
head
disappeared
within
a
few
seconds
not
much
lacing
really
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
sweet
malts
and
a
light
earthy
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
bit
of
a
dark
fruity
flavor
with
a
little
brown
sugar
and
prune
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
it
wasnt
too
bad
of
a
beer
but
not
the
best
bock
ive
had
o
at
this
point
i
expect
tastefully
bold
beers
from
new
glarus
every
time
and
this
one
hasnt
let
me
down
a
testament
to
the
potential
for
complexity
and
intrigue
in
lager
beers
uffda
continues
my
recent
streak
of
experiencing
inspired
beers
from
wisconsin
od
i
really
like
this
one
a
lot
easy
to
drink
but
oh
so
satisfying
this
one
was
picked
up
straight
from
the
brewery
almost
as
good
as
it
gets
o
another
solid
offering
from
ng
one
might
wish
to
heed
the
advice
on
the
label
and
let
this
warm
up
a
little
as
it
does
bring
out
flavor
and
showcase
complexity
o
tasted
more
like
a
dubbel
to
me
one
is
all
i
would
drink
too
sweet
thanks
to
friend
schmittymack
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
at
our
mini
and
unintentional
new
glarus
fest
2
weeks
back
poured
a
reddish
color
with
less
than
a
quarter
inch
of
light
brown
foam
on
top
aromas
of
chocolate
caramel
and
sweet
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
chcolate
caramel
and
sweet
malt
in
the
mouth
much
the
same
at
a
cooler
temp
its
a
delicious
bock
with
a
chocolatey
tinge
and
a
nice
grainy
malty
kick
once
warmed
up
the
grains
give
out
a
rich
buttery
mouthfeel
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
really
outstanding
a
filling
beer
why
they
released
it
in
springsummer
is
beyond
me
but
ill
take
it
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
like
i
said
it
would
make
for
a
very
good
winter
warmer
and
it
pairs
well
with
pretty
much
whatever
you
throw
at
it
check
it
out
if
you
can
overall
not
that
impressive
honestly
lacking
balancing
hop
bitterness
the
malt
character
leans
to
hard
toward
the
dark
fruit
spectrum
and
the
mouthfeel
lacks
crispness
drinkability
a
very
good
winter
beer
which
i
am
drinking
in
the
very
late
spring
latest
bottling
of
this
one
shared
with
friends
and
my
girlfriend
last
night
poured
a
ruby
red
nearly
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
hang
around
very
long
picked
up
roasted
malt
and
fruit
in
the
nose
taste
is
where
this
one
comes
through
in
my
opinion
caramel
toasted
malt
some
fruitiness
and
just
a
touch
of
cocoa
this
is
the
first
time
in
about
three
years
or
better
ive
had
this
fresh
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
one
of
mr
carreys
better
efforts
i
could
quaff
a
few
of
these
i
rather
enjoyed
this
new
glarus
effort
as
this
was
quite
flavorful
and
complex
for
a
bock
beer
while
also
retaining
a
pretty
good
drinkability
for
the
size
this
would
definitely
be
a
good
one
to
chew
on
during
those
cooler
months
d
a
decent
beer
i
was
expecting
more
flavoraroma
for
7
uffda
is
a
good
easydrinking
beer
with
a
lot
of
kick
seems
a
little
bit
big
for
the
standard
bock
style
and
could
be
seen
as
dangerouslydrinkable
but
altogether
i
consider
it
a
perfect
seasonal
sipper
overall
a
nice
easy
beer
to
drink
maybe
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
the
over
7
abv
can
sneek
up
on
you
as
this
goes
down
so
quick
delicious
offering
give
it
a
whirl
overall
very
pleasant
with
just
a
little
more
bitterness
and
maybe
a
little
too
little
sweetness
good
richness
o
a
delicious
beer
a
doppelbock
in
training
very
nice
job
again
by
new
glarus
this
will
be
a
standard
in
my
fridge
while
available
overall
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
love
it
i
think
its
very
good
for
the
style
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
could
be
a
bit
thickermore
malty
but
still
very
good
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
light
head
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
nice
caramel
characteristics
plus
some
light
fruit
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
bread
the
taste
is
similar
but
a
bit
subdued
with
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
plus
some
doughy
bread
good
feel
with
nice
carbonation
a
bit
plain
but
drinks
fairly
well
in
the
end
pours
a
black
color
with
a
little
ruby
hue
thin
tan
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
burnt
sugar
roasted
malts
and
a
little
chocolate
tastes
of
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
burnt
brown
sugar
mouthfeel
is
average
and
a
thin
body
with
slight
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
overall
very
tasty
beer
im
new
to
bocks
but
this
is
a
great
introduction
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
some
of
the
scotch
ales
ive
had
ba
states
retired
too
bad
i
enjoyed
it
and
always
like
supporting
locals
it
is
a
huge
shame
that
this
is
retired
this
is
probably
the
most
enjoyable
bock
i
have
ever
drank
taste
sweet
strong
malty
even
a
dash
of
zest
from
maybe
a
little
more
hop
presence
than
i
was
expecting
mouthfeel
hangs
around
doesnt
grow
or
contract
somewhat
drinkable
for
a
bock
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
a
bit
of
warmth
going
down
very
clean
malty
character
i
dig
this
one
a
lot
cant
remember
where
i
got
this
but
thanks
to
whomever
di
really
like
this
beer
but
feel
that
its
not
holding
up
consistently
with
age
i
had
a
couple
a
week
ago
and
they
were
much
better
than
this
one
im
reviewing
however
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
in
this
beer
and
i
hope
they
put
it
uffda
back
into
their
2010
beer
schedule
pours
a
very
dark
brown
a
deep
beautiful
dark
brown
with
a
nice
2cm
head
but
the
bubbles
are
loose
and
falls
down
leaving
only
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
beer
is
fairly
clear
if
you
can
see
through
the
darkness
the
smell
is
incredibly
sweet
and
nutty
like
toffee
raisins
thick
heavy
caramellized
syrup
reminds
me
a
bit
more
of
like
an
english
barleywine
or
a
more
cleanly
fermented
dark
belgian
i
wish
it
was
maybe
a
bit
less
on
the
toffee
almost
buttery
taste
a
bit
cleaner
with
some
real
graininess
i
expected
more
graininess
a
little
bit
of
toastiness
but
id
say
that
the
sweetness
is
ok
i
dont
know
if
the
grains
are
right
in
this
or
maybe
by
experience
with
bocks
has
just
been
a
bit
confused
the
taste
is
good
very
bready
and
quite
grainy
very
sticky
some
of
the
nice
qualities
of
a
bock
but
still
too
raisiny
and
toffeey
for
a
bock
its
like
a
delicious
blend
of
belgian
german
and
british
to
be
honest
but
it
says
right
there
on
the
bottle
uffda
which
i
recently
learned
from
someone
is
norwegian
so
out
goes
the
german
implications
there
thanks
weatyweiss
with
a
neck
label
that
says
bock
i
woudl
actually
like
it
its
like
a
coldfermented
belgian
style
to
me
just
think
of
it
without
quite
the
same
yeast
profile
the
abv
is
a
little
high

very
wonderful
tasting
brew
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
no
matter
the
style
new
glarus
does
it
right
style
after
style
dan
and
the
boys
create
world
class
brews
to
that
i
tip
my
hat
new
glarus
takes
another
one
of
my
less
than
favorite
styles
and
knocks
it
out
of
the
park
i
could
drink
these
any
day
tpd975sep

the
abv
at
7

might
catch
up
thericajul

and
chocolate
abv
at
7
8
is
well
hidden
no
doubt
about
it
the
only
real
fault
is
that
it
becomes
a
little
too
sweet
as
it
warms
and
maybe
a
hint
more
hops
wouldve
kept
that
in
check
still
like
the
bottle
says
bottom
line
this
is
quite
the
tasty
bock
the
only
bad
thing
i
can
really
say
about
it
is
that
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
1
at
a
sitting
see
my
comment
about
it
being
filling
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
tan
head
lots
of
nice

the

is
a
joy
to

recommended

very
drinkable
i
cant
believe
that
this
is
7
30
abv
this
could
be
a
dangerous
brew
i
can
see
how
easy
it
would
be
to
polish
off
4
or
5
in
a
sitting
and
not
feel
them
until
you
stand
up
i
havent
had
many
bocks
yet
but
this
has
been
my
favorite
thus
far
very
tasty
once
again
lovely
simple
bottle
art
from
new
glarus
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
proper
fluffy
two
finger
head
atop
smells
nutty
with
plenty
of
caramel
thats
about
it
that
im
picking
up
taste
is
heavy
on
the
malts
with
caramel
and
toasted
bread
upfront
backed
up
with
coating
grape
juice
finishing
with
a
tad
of
smoke
and
faint
chocolate
hops
are
just
right
for
the
style
appropriately
a
background
note
a
touch
of
cola
creeps
in
which
is
kind
of
antithetical
to
the
apparently
light
carbonation
mouthfeels
a
little
creamy
and
could
use
a
bit
more
effervescence
overall
a
fairly
solid
bock
in
spite
of
the
lingering
cola
flavor
thanks
robbyc1
for
this
one
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
manageable
bock
with
a
notable
portion
of
roasted
malt
and
a
solid
profile
a
bit
more
body
and
this
one
would
be
great
cheers
d
i
like
it
its
a
good
standby
beer
just
when
you
thought
that
the
bock
style
was
fading
into
mediocrity
out
comes
this
full
flavors
bold
younger
brother
to
the
beloved
dopplebock
a
lot
of
the
same
characteristics
shine
in
this
beer
that
i
am
accustomed
to
seeing
in
a
dopple
a
firm
hearty
malt
bill
with
rich
breadiness
savory
caramelization
and
an
unwaivering
mouthfeel
lower
on
esters
than
dopples
but
strong
on
the
barley
malt
flavors
mild
alcohols
make
it
easy
on
the
head
and
the
stomach
finishes
with
a
rich
rounded
attenuated
malt
flavor
no
astringency
or
graininess
to
be
found
certainly
among
the
best
of
the
bocks
thanks
nathan
d
moderate
abv
and
strong
flavor
profile
there
isnt
much
more
that
i
need
continuing
through
the
sampler
uffda
is
another
good
beer
from
new
glarus
a
nice
mix
of
malty
flavors
good
for
sipping
on
a
cool
spring
evening
a
very
tasty
and
aromatic
beer
and
if
you
can
get
past
or
prefer
the
superlow
carbonation
level
di
wont
buy
it
again
for
awhile
but
i
had
a
good
time
pours
a
deep
clear
mahogany
color
with
fiery
edges
a
tan
head
slips
quickly
but
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
brings
dark
but
not
heavy
fruits
cherries
and
prunes
toffee
and
roasted
chocolate
malts
balance
out
a
very
nice
bock
nose
the
taste
is
dark
fruits
and
tea
lightly
creamed
roasted
chocolate
and
light
coffee
bitterness
mediumfull
and
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
nice
bock
its
tasty
but
not
too
heavy
and
the
alcohol
is
dastardly
deceptive
new
glarus
has
another
winner
in
this
one
poured
from
12oz
bottle
my
friend
chris
brought
back
from
his
trip
to
madison
along
with
several
others
poured
into
delirium
tremens
snifter
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
kakia
colored
thick
head
smells
a
sweet
malt
mixed
with
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
taste
is
chocolate
and
hints
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
feels
lighter
than
the
color
would
suggest
this
is
a
easy
drinking
bock
with
the
alcohol
not
present
for
being
7
3
but
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
making
it
a
dangerous
session
bock
this
is
the
56th
time
ive
had
this
one
and
i
maintain
bocks
normally
arent
my
thing
but
uffda
is
pretty
good
for
my
understanding
of
the
style
probably
better
than
most
stateside
bocks
ive
enjoyed
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
pours
a
deep
amber
mohogany
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
cocoa
and
coffee
in
the
taste
a
sweet
roasty
lager
malt
a
small
bitter
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
to
sweet
roasty
lager
aftertaste
light
in
the
body
yet
decently
big
nice
roastiness
yet
lager
notes
this
brew
has
a
deep
brown
coffee
color
with
almost
no
head
the
smell
is
of
caramel
and
coffee
with
mild
floral
undertones
my
first
sip
was
lighter
than
i
expected
and
i
did
not
get
as
strong
of
a
roasted
malt
flavor
as
i
have
come
to
know
with
bocks
this
was
more
complex
with
less
over
the
top
taste
there
was
almost
a
floral
after
taste
that
was
noticed
in
the
smell
of
the
beer
after
a
few
more
drinks
the
complexity
came
through
with
the
more
traditional
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
carrying
weight
but
in
softer
tones
this
is
a
great
beer
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
and
not
just
swallowed
bottle
for
bottle
real
nice
d
not
a
bad
offering
at
all
a
bit
better
than
the
sam
offering
in
my
opinion
and
a
solid
offering
from
the
brewers
at
new
glarus
dont
miss
this
one
its
good
this
is
a
very
good
beer
for
being
from
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
but
with
the
levity
out
of
the
way
this
does
present
a
quite
acceptable
brewing
and
drinking
effort
i
think
this
is
getting
better
as
it
warms
this
beer
is
rich
with
a
thick
malty
backbone
deep
malty
and
a
little
thick
the
raisin
is
very
faint
smooth
clean
slightly
herbal
after
taste
in
the
mouth
its
got
a
strong
raisin
background
flavor
going
on
in
the
nose
maybe
you
smell
a
bit
more
caramel
than
you
get
in
the
mouth
but
its
rich
and
sweet
and
malty
to
be
sure
good
stuff
i
usually
enjoy
new
glarus
products
very
much
but
this
was
a
let
down
i
am
hopping
that
it
was
a
less
then
stellar
batch
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
heavier
as
i
feel
this
is
just
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
aftertaste
is
sweet
with
some
drying
qualities
another
solid
brew
from
new
glarus
thanks
again
ed
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
head
activity
dies
down
quit
quickly
the
smell
is
of
chocolat
and
roasted
malt
that
changes
to
caramel
when
it
warms
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bittersweet
chocolattoffee
taste
with
slightly
roasted
maltiness
very
nice
set
of
balanced
flavors
it
is
medium
body
and
is
not
very
well
carbonated
seems
to
be
a
pattern
with
new
glarus
a
good
beer
on
a
cool
evening
my
favorite
of
new
glarus
beers
i
have
sampled
d
this
is
a
very
good
bock
my
fifth
new
glarus
product
and
ive
loved
them
all
gift
from
my
brother
who
visted
door
county
first
of
all
i
just
love
the
straight
up
norwegianness
of
this
bottle
i
come
from
a
long
line
of
wegians
and
my
grandma
always
used
to
spout
out
the
uffdas
dark
brown
burnt
sienna
color
with
a
slippery
tan
head
not
much
lacing
at
all
lightly
roasted
caramelly
malt
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
toffee
no
hop
profile
in
the
nose
to
speak
of
tastes
wonderful
malty
goodness
spreads
throughout
the
mouth
and
lingers
until
the
slightest
hint
of
herby
noble
hop
character
helps
to
balance
and
release
the
palate
i
would
never
have
guessed
at
the
abv
over
7
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
enjoyable
to
sip
on
a
brisk
night
this
is
a
good
bock
i
tried
my
first
uffda
about
a
year
ago
and
have
enjoyed
each
one
ever
since
d
drinkability
is
igh
with
this
brew
if
you
like
thicker
beers
this
one
is
thick
enough
that
you
would
expect
bitterness
but
its
incredibl
sweet
and
only
gets
sweeter
as
it
warms
my
only
qualm
is
that
it
is
so
sweet
that
after
a
couple
i
get
outsugered
and
its
not
so
pleasant
still
very
nice
the
border
are
truely
blessed
makes
a
great
beer
float
as
well
d
great
for
its
weight
drinkability
is
good
really
nice
served
around
48f
as
the
bottle
suggests
but
even
better
as
it
warms
well
balanced
and
quite
enjoyable
only
real
flaw
was
the
carbonation
but
even
that
subsided
a
bit
as
i
let
it
sit
and
swirled
it
a
little
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
very
drinkable
low
carbonation
nice
creaminess
and
while
i
may
not
want
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
one
serving
of
this
was
just
not
enough
well
done
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
low
to
medium
carbonation
d
a
good
bock
that
is
enjoyable
to
drink
to
say
the
least
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
with
little
bits
of
light
coming
through
light
tan
head
of
two
fingers
takes
a
while
to
die
down
to
a
thin
lacing
pretty
good
stickiness
on
this
one
light
caramel
malt
notes
in
the
nose
blended
with
some
brown
sugar
very
light
and
crisp
smells
not
overpowering
but
still
very
noticable
starts
off
with
a
very
roasted
nut
flavor
which
is
followed
by
taste
much
like
caramel
corn
yummy
finishes
with
a
nice
wheat
bread
flavor
very
unique
tastes
on
the
tongue
for
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
very
easy
to
put
this
one
down
probably
one
of
the
best
bocks
ive
had
to
date
amazing
representation
of
this
style
i
really
enjoy
the
beers
new
glarus
puts
out
cant
wait
to
try
even
more
a
nice
bock
no
complaints
this
was
one
of
the
few
new
glarus
offerings
i
had
yet
to
try
and
they
rarely
disappoint
looks
a
dark
red
smells
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
the
flavor
follows
the
smell
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
more
than
i
expected
in
a
bock
and
yet
stays
pretty
light
had
no
idea
it
was
7
abv
until
i
read
so
on
this
site
quite
a
surprise
its
hidden
very
well
very
drinkable
very
tasty
nice
work
again
new
glarus
like
a
good
bock
uffda
showcases
the
wide
flavor
potential
of
malts
its
most
surprising
attribute
is
that
it
does
it
in
an
a
highly
quaffable
way
this
is
a
solid
bock
worth
searching
out
if
youre
in
wisconsin
taste
follows
nose
closely
again
not
rich
but
detectable
carbonation
livens
things
up
a
bit
but
im
glad
to
see
it
subtle
im
not
a
bock
fan
yet
this
one
i
can
drink
without
making
faces
drinks
very
easy
for
the
abv
but
just
needs
a
little
more
guts
thanks
to
my
bro
mnwags
for
the
hookup
interesting
brew
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
better
bocks
ive
tried
this
bock
pours
nearly
black
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
a
thin
offwhite
head
formed
diminished
to
a
lasting
skim
with
nice
lacing
the
beer
is
a
little
cloudy
definitely
some
yeast
chunks
suspended
in
the
brew
a
very
inviting
nose
to
this
beer
there
is
a
moderatehigh
chocolate
aroma
a
low
roasted
character
and
also
some
caramel
sweetness
as
expected
no
hop
aroma
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
an
initial
moderate
sweetness
more
bittersweet
caramel
and
raisinlike
the
taste
quickly
turns
to
moderate
chocolate
flavor
with
some
low
roasted
tones
the
hop
bitterness
is
mediumlow
but
provides
a
nice
balance
no
hop
flavor
the
finish
is
nice
as
well
leaves
a
little
chocolate
on
the
tongue
long
after
the
swallow
the
carbonation
is
moderate
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
the
beer
exhibits
a
very
full
body
overall
this
beer
was
impressive
it
might
be
my
favorite
new
glarus
although
favorite
beer
so
often
depends
on
the
mood
the
appearance
aroma
and
taste
were
all
top
notch
as
was
the
creamy
mouthfeel
the
only
knock
is
i
couldnt
drink
a
bunch
of
these
very
full
bodied
and
rather
filling
but
then
again
a
bock
like
this
should
be
enjoyed
slowly
poured
from
a
12oz
brown
bottle
into
my
adnams
tulip
pint
glass
appears
a
translucent
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
smell
is
similar
to
a
cocoa
dusted
cherry
followed
by
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
tastes
of
semisweet
chocolate
mild
coffee
and
molasses
a
notch
above
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
smooth
drinking
with
a
finish
that
is
both
sweet
and
slightly
sour
recommended
mouth
feel
was
smooth
and
fairly
creamy
tm
good
complex
and
smooth
with
deep
chocolate
and
coffee
undertones
d
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
complexity
and
although
in
my
description
it
sounds
very
sweet
it
is
really
a
very
subtle
sweetness
there
is
no
pot
caramel
flavor
that
seems
to
dominate
most
bad
bock
and
this
one
really
caught
me
by
surprise
this
tends
to
be
a
beer
style
i
rather
enjoy
its
not
tops
in
the
class
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
there
werent
any
off
putting
flavors
or
undertones
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
the
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
the
carbonation
is
not
an
issue
with
this
beer
and
seemed
fitting
to
the
style
the
flavor
improved
nicely
as
it
warmed
received
in
a
mixed
sixpack
trade
from
powertrader
extraordinaire
nflmvp
many
thanks
for
the
opportunity
poured
into
a
stange
glass
new
glaruss
stab
at
a
bock
is
a
deep
dusky
russett
color
with
a
modest
but
dense
tan
head
which
leaves
substantial
bands
of
lacing
after
each
draught
mellow
aromas
of
plum
juice
dark
dried
cherries
and
brown
sugar
along
with
some
earthy
and
spicy
hops
a
cherry
and
caramel
sweetness
is
the
most
recognizable
aspect
of
this
malty
brew
some
vague
whisperings
of
leafy
and
spicy
hops
come
through
but
are
rather
less
than
noticeable
thick
somewhat
syrupy
mouthfeel
but
never
sticky
or
cloying
miniscule
alcohol
bite
at
the
finish
which
is
offdry
and
more
or
less
clean
im
not
exactly
an
afficionado
of
the
style
but
this
seems
about
right
for
a
bock
i
dont
normally
seek
these
beers
out
but
if
i
were
in
wisconsin
on
a
cold
evening
i
just
might
reach
for
an
uffda
fair
enough
the
last
bottle
from
a
sixpack
i
bought
from
the
source
in
oct
06
poured
into
my
new
glarus
pint
glass
a
dark
brown
almost
black
espresso
color
with
a
thick
head
that
disappears
after
a
few
minutes
swirling
will
bring
back
a
thin
cappuccino
looking
head
with
minumal
lace
the
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
barley
coffee
with
noticable
alcohol
the
taste
reveals
that
there
were
definitely
dark
roasted
barley
used
in
the
making
of
this
brew
the
brewery
actually
has
barley
at
different
stages
of
roasting
available
to
taste
during
the
tour
they
offer
i
remember
tasting
the
darker
barley
from
this
tour
when
i
take
a
sip
of
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
noticable
at
least
to
my
palate
with
some
malt
and
hops
to
balance
it
all
out
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
this
could
be
a
short
session
beer
for
me
as
i
continue
drinking
it
the
alcohol
takes
effect
and
makes
me
wish
for
another
i
would
probably
buy
another
six
the
next
time
im
in
wisconsin
pours
a
deep
clay
and
cola
color
a
little
cloudy
but
you
can
seem
some
cool
lager
carbonation
soft
whipped
egg
whites
head
with
meager
retention
the
aroma
is
still
dark
fruity
mlats
with
some
added
coffee
and
a
pronounced
roast
as
well
the
taste
maintains
that
intrigueing
roasted
coffee
mixed
with
plums
and
other
dark
fruits
an
intertesting
take
on
a
traditional
german
lager
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
would
be
a
little
hard
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
day
d
this
beer
tastes
fantastic
and
feels
good
going
down
drinkability
i
have
had
several
of
these
in
the
past
and
thankfully
have
a
few
more
left
why
oh
why
cant
new
glarus
distribute
outside
of
wisconsin
damn
the
three
tier
system
uffda
is
a
wonderful
version
of
a
style
that
i
sometimes
find
difficult
to
enjoy
as
is
so
often
the
case
making
a
hoppy
style
more
hoppy
and
making
a
malty
style
more
malty
as
new
glarus
has
done
here
is
the
key
to
a
successful
beer
this
one
might
be
wellknown
for
its
name
but
it
deserves
to
be
wellknown
for
its
quality
and
its
deliciousness
dark

meaty

with
notes

sweet

bitter
not
bad
but
not
overly
complex
medium

and
a
silky
feel
bock
this
beer
may
be
good
but
its
definitely
pushing
the
boundaries
of
the
bock
definition
pours
almost
black
with
a
reasonably
dense
slightly
rocky
tan
head
smells
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
orange
peel
like
one
of
those
candies
you
get
at
christmas
tastes
of
chocolate
overroasted
coffee
beans
and
finishes
like
youve
just
eaten
a
spoonful
of
cocoa
powder
mouthfeel
is
suprisingly
thin
for
a
beer
with
so
much
flavor
doesnt
satisfy
the
way
many
of
its
breatheren
do
drinkability
is
limited
by
that
dry
finish
that
makes
you
want
a
drink
of
something
liquid
as
a
chaser
an
interesting
brew
maybe
worth
a
taste
but
not
anything
i
will
lament
not
being
imported
into
my
admitedly
draconianmachiavellian
state
somethings
a
little
different
about
this
bock
made
with
an
ale
yeast
maybe
its
tasty
it
just
seems
to
be
missing
a
lager
yeast
character
tastes
like
a
nice
big
brown
lots
of
chocolate
malt
but
i
found
the
aroma
and
taste
a
little
muted
not
a
bad
beer
give
it
a
try
i
have
sampled
this
beer
exclusively
as
pourn
from
a
12
oz
bottle
it
exhibits
a
rich
mahogany
color
with
a
decent
head
which
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
along
the
edges
the
deep
color
of
this
beer
belies
its
equally
deep
flavor
the
beer
is
extraordinarily
rich
and
a
bit
malty
its
flavor
is
only
enhanced
by
its
complex
almost
burnt
smell
as
indicated
on
its
wrapper
this
beer
truly
is
best
enjoyed
a
bit
warm
around
50
degrees
or
so
as
this
only
makes
it
sweeter
and
more
mellow
if
this
beer
does
have
a
flaw
it
is
in
its
mouthfeel
for
such
a
rich
smelling
and
tasting
beer
it
seems
a
bit
light
on
the
tongue
on
the
other
hand
this
lightness
does
contribute
to
it
being
a
very
drinkable
brew
as
is
common
to
the
style
the
taste
leaned
toward
the
sweet
side
hops
were
there
in
the
background
this
was
nicely
done
and
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
i
seem
to
have
forgotten
how
much
i
enjoy
the
bock
styles
new

12

fringes
and
an
opulent
thin
coarse

of

some

and

dry
this
brew
a
bit
finish
is
sweet
and
clinging
with
aftertones
of
frangelico
and
kahlua
not
burgeoning
not
dazzling
a
solid
middle
player
on
par
for
the
style
for
sure
d
a
tasty
drink
in
many
ways
bock
not
sure
of
that
classification
based
on
what
im
used
to
throw
that
out
and
im
drinking
a
couple
and
enjoying
this
beer
pours
a
semiopaque
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
this
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
roasted
malt
and
very
straight
forward
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
it
isnt
bad
but
lacks
any
sort
of
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
a
silky
smoothness
overall
i
can
tell
that
this
beer
is
made
well
but
it
lacks
the
depth
i
like
to
see
in
a
beer
drinkability
is
decent
for
abv
its
a
bit
too
foamy
and
simple
to
be
very
exciting
i
dont
find
this
combination
of
flavors
as
something
id
seek
out
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
drinkability
despite
the
variance
from
the
style
i
liked
it
it
went
down
well
and
im
glad
i
have
a
few
more
very
dunkelcolored
this
beer
had
no
head
dark
coloring
slight
raosted
chocolate
makes
me
think
more
of
a
brown
ale
than
a
dunkel
not
much
of
a
smell
going
the
munich
malts
become
more
evident
as
it
warms
up
its
tasty
and
drinkable
great
name
i
think
it
is
becoming
obvious
that
i
need
to
move
eastward
i
have
read
other
reviews
of
this
beer
and
none
of
them
describe
my
experience
so
maybe
i
got
a
glass
from
a
bad
barrel
or
something
allinall
its
a
solid
beer
somewhat
light
for
a
bock
but
the
maltiness
is
good
while
you
have
it
i
suspect
that
if
this
werent
so
light
it
would
cross
from
a
bock
into
a
pretty
solid
porter
it
needs
more
of
a
nose
though
and
needs
to
assert
itself
more
the
label
calls
itself
big
but
its
really
sort
of
just
medium
sized
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
i
wouldnt
really
classify
it
as
a
bock
as
it
has
too
much
chocolate
and
the
malt
character
is
a
bit
off
dont
get
me
wrong
this
isnt
as
out
of
the
bock
style
as
shiner
and
the
likes
are
here
in
texas
but
it
is
still
pretty
far
from
what
you
would
expect
in
bavaria
regardless
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
to
soak
up
and
the
balance
doesnt
make
it
annoying
in
any
way
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
slainte
what
a
fullflavored
fruity
bock
its
very
good
pitch
black
no
head
to
speak
of
smels
fruity
and
roasted
the
taste
is
dark
dried
fruitraisin
prune
date
fig
along
with
a
roasted
grain
and
chocolate
malt
very
nice
full
mouthfeel
i
like
this
a
lot
id
love
to
kick
these
back
on
a
cool
fall
evening
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
not
the
richest
or
most
decadent
bock
ive
had
or
the
most
refined
but
this
is
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
treat
this
would
make
a
great
session
brew
in
the
upcoming
cooler
weather
or
also
be
good
crossover
fare
for
someone
interested
in
exploring
what
can
be
done
with
dark
malts
ill
be
enjoying
this
beer
again
sometime
thanks
to
bashiba
for
sharing
this
brew
d
easy
for
a
bock
i
will
probably
have
another
not
something
i
would
hunt
down
but
if
i
ran
across
it
i
would
defenatly
grab
a
6pack
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
ruby
not
much
head
not
much
lacing
not
much
going
on
aroma
is
decent
for
a
bock
chocolate
and
earthy
almost
smells
a
little
like
dirt
some
caramel
maltiness
underneath
mouth
is
decent
taste
is
nicely
malty
slightly
fruity
nutty
and
overall
a
pretty
decent
bock
though
not
my
favorite
bock
ever
id
have
it
again
and
probably
will
packs
a
lot
of
complexity
into
an
incredibly
smooth
flavor
kudos
to
new
glarus
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
ruby
red
hues
a
cgood
size
creamy
tan
head
aroma
is
nice
with
some
rich
smoky
tobacco
some
bourbony
alcohol
roasted
malts
and
a
little
chocolatey
malt
taste
is
kind
of
like
a
cola
and
coffe
mix
with
some
sweet
sugary
malts
mixing
with
a
roasted
malt
finish
a
little
milky
tang
in
the
finish
from
the
roastiness
alcohol
was
only
evident
in
the
aroma
but
is
hidden
in
the
taste
no
real
bitterness
to
speak
of
quite
sweet
and
roasty
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
creamy
with
a
little
spice
in
the
finish
a
sipper
but
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
a
winter
evening
either
way
i
am
real
happy
with
this
one
the
biggest
thing
this
beer
lacks
is
the
malty
aroma
of
a
bock
it
starts
the
whole
drinking
experience
on
a
down
note
color
is
an
exellent
dark
caramel
hops
are
almost
complete
missing
from
flavor
even
more
subdued
than
what
it
should
be
it
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
which
also
makes
it
very
drinkable
for
a
bock
with
a
7
3
abv
it
drinks
almost
like
a
session
beer
better
than
leinies
big
butt
but
not
by
much
for
a
7
3
abv
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
props
to
badbeer
for
the
bottle
good
beer
some
would
find
it
too
rich
but
ive
been
permanently
damaged
by
imperial
stouts
so
its
ok
with
me
the
brussels
lace
held
strong
from
beginning
to
end
the
glass
is
toast
ill
need
another
for
my
next
beer
ive
been
sitting
here
for
a
few
minutes
and
all
i
can
taste
is
raisins
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
solid
bock
baby
made
for
session
drinking
perfect
for
savoring
another
reason
why
new
glarus
kicks
so
much
tail
d
this
is
a
nice
bock
nothing
special
but
it
is
easy
and
pleasing
to
drink
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
six
pack
or
maybe
it
was
a
four
pack
of
this
wonderful
beer
from
my
wifes
cousin
in
wisconsin
i
poured
the
beer
into
my
trustly
duvel
tulip
glass
what
a
great
deep
brown
color
this
bock
poured
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
disapated
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
is
of
toasted
malts
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
nice
bouquet
of
chocolate
and
toasted
malt
what
an
enjoyable
taste
and
with
a
medium
body
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
winner
from
new
glarus
dangerously
drinkable
for
7
30
abv
i
think
this
beer
is
the
high
end
of
the
bock
category
and
is
really
close
to
a
nice
dopplebock
aroma
holds
brown
sugar
raisin
bread
pudding
pumpernickel
and
spice
deep
garnet
color
pinky
thin

that
is
both
creamy

bubbly
mmmm
nice

lots
of
dark
roasty
pumpernickelraisin
notes
sweet
malt
brown
sugar
molasses
notes
toward
the
back
the
flavor
is
a
bit
watery
and
tinny
at
first
but
i
personally
started
too
cold
it
goes
away
as
it
warms
chocolate
notes
pop
out
as
it
warms
aftertaste
is
damn
tasty
like
dark
fruit
sweetened
pumpernickel
damn
fine
brew
however
big
this
bock
is
it
can
pack
punch
great
offering
from
new
glarus
from
the
bottle
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
got
a
big
wiff
of
sweetness
like
brown
sugar
and
a
strong
alcohol
poured
mahogany
with
a
light
tan
head
that
left
some
lacing
aroma
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
went
away
out
came
a
sour
cherry
smell
than
chocolate
malts
and
spices
flavor
a
lot
better
than
tha
aroma
creamy
chocolate
dark
fruits
molasses
with
a
nice
touch
of
coffee
and
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
flavor
brought
the
rating
up
on
this
beergood
beer
pours
a
nice
finger
width
head
with
a
fairly
strong
lacing
smells
fairly
sweet
with
a
strong
coffee
flavor
and
smell
of
fresh
barley
like
you
would
smell
if
you
were
in
the
new
glarus
brewery
a
very
dark
beer
with
a
slight
dark
amber
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
taste
is
like
coffee
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
fizzy
and
smooth
its
a
slightly
sweet
beer
such
as
you
would
expect
from
a
bock
bier
beer
pours
a
very
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
slowly
dissipating
head
with
good
lacing
the
aromas
of
this
beer
are
of
coffee
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
caramel
upfront
taste
is
of
caramel
chocolate
and
toffee
finishing
with
a
coffee
taste
beer
is
medium
bodied
one
or
two
of
these
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
after
that
it
becomes
a
bit
cloying
still
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
tastes
better
as
it
warms
a
bit
12
ounce
bottle
new
glarus
uffda
bock
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
dense
head
the
aroma
is
vanilla
nuts
and
whiffs
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
malty
and
nutty
with
a
little
bit
of
fruitiness
some
chocolate
flavor
too
tastes
good
at
first
but
the
finish
is
very
metallic
and
tastes
a
little
like
blood
medium
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
not
especially
good
one
of
these
is
plenty
for
me
new
glarus
makes
several
very
good
beers
and
several
mediocre
beers
this
is
one
of
the
latter
very
nice
this
one
could
get
you
into
trouble
solid
unheralded
new

light
on

could
use
a

more

very
drinkable

cellared
a
couple

uffdas
for
6
months
1
year
and
18

they
cellared
well
and
in
fact
i
would
say
that
i
enjoyed
them
most
after
18
months
the
uffda
had
better
developed
dark
fruit
flavors
and
a
richer

im
upping
the
score
a
touch

is

even
a

silky
and
there
is
a
solid

lingers

good

again
this
one
wont
knock
your
socks
off

a

still
an

beer
from
the
folks
in

this
beer
has
a
rich
mahogany
color
as
suggested
on
the
label
such
a
deep
vivid
color
with
some
bubbles
and
a
thin
ring
of

looks
very
appetizing
smells
malty
hints
of

sugar
and
maple

some

this

is
a

for

that

mostly
smooth

i
just
dont

out

a

some
cedar
even
nothing

this

ive

an

very
little

but
pretty
good

smells
sweet
with
cherries
a
little
chocolate
and
a

tastes
similar
and
like
the
bottle
says
the
warmer
bock
is
the
sweeter
it
gets
however
though
the
label
assures
me
that
i
can
expect
deep
chocolate
and

undertones
i
detect
little
a
porter
or
stout
uffda
is
not
with
just
a

might
i
add
that
this
is
quenchable
enough
to
session
on
a
summer
night
o
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggested
to
me
but
overall
a
very
good
beer
from
new
glarus
taste
is
very
straightforward
this
would
be
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
on
a
midrange
temperature
day
with
ease

thanks
wibeerman
for
the
opportunity
a
mild
carbonation
but
really
lacking
in
a
rich
bock
taste
failed
to
meet
my
expectations
a
very
wellmade
bock
a
smooth
wellbalanced
tasty
lager
o
not
quite
in
the
outstanding
territory
but
its
a
good
beer
with
some
enjoyable
qualities
itd
be
easy
to
kill
a
sixer
of
these
o
while
new
glarus
back
40
is
a
drinkable
bock
to
be
sure
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
something
its
somewhat
transparent
flavor
and
thin
feel
dont
stand
up
to
their
uffda
bock
a
crown
jewel
for
the
style
which
begs
the
question
why
for
back
40
o
solid
well
executed
example
of
a
bock
no
surprise
here
are
you
surprised
overall
just
more
awesomely
executed
beer
from
new
glarus
i
feel
like
a
broken
record
saying
this
but
they
do
all
their
styles
so
well
this
one
is
a
touch
single
dimensional
on
the
sweetness
side
but
thats
getting
nitpicky
no
doubt
worth
a
try
another
choice
beer
from
new
glarus
from
a
sampler
pack
a
friend
brought
across
the
border
gorgeous
dark
caramel
color
smooth
drinker
that
goes
down
without
a
fight
and
leaves
several
distinct
levels
of
lacing
behind
dont
be
deceived
by
the
color
on
this
one
it
is
certainly
sessionable
an
absolute
must
for
any
lagerlover
who
is
lucky
enough
to
have
access
to
it
back
forty
is
an
all
around
well
made
bock
its
easy
drinking
shows
a
touch
of
spice
with
bread
galore
and
a
dry
finish
i
could
see
myself
picking
this
up
again
in
the
future
and
i
suggest
you
give
it
a
try
as
well
if
youre
into
the
style
all
around
not
a
bad
beer
i
picked
it
up
in
a
variety
pack
im
not
sure
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
though
it
pours
beautifully
with
a
full
head
but
thats
where
it
ends
for
me
a
bock
should
be
full
and
strong
and
this
is
weak
and
mild
and
very
sweet
a
lot
of
what
new
glarus
does
to
me
is
just
spotted
cow
with
a
twist
and
i
am
not
a
fan
of
spotted
cow
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
copper
edges
and
is
mostly
clear
with
a
tight
off
white
head
nose
is
toasted
grain
sweet
malt
and
brown
sugar
taste
has
less
grain
and
a
hint
musky
a
bit
sweet
brown
sugar
stronger
carb
flavors
get
a
hint
muted
even
as
i
like
the
maltyrich
character
of
back
40
i
find
its
onedimensional
sweetness
unable
to
balance
with
any
melanoidin
character
within
the
beer
unable
to
finish
drier
and
unable
to
deliver
more
complex
malt
taste
both
limit
the
beers
more
favorable
finishes
overall
if
you
like
bock
beer
youll
love
this
its
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
great
with
some
barbecued
ribs
or
am
i
just
too
drunk
overall
one
of
the
better
bocks
i
have
had
i
would
have
this
one
again
smooth
caramelized
malts
nutty
and
dry
flavors
earthy
witha
clean
aftertaste
a
little
watery
but
thankfully
not
sticky
sweet
like
some
bocks
this
one
is
lighter
with
traditional
flavors
less
sweet
than
uffda
used
to
be
overall
its
not
bad
but
not
my
personal
favorite
pours
a
muddy
bronze
color
with
a
modest
coarse
offwhite
head
aroma
is
fairly
onedimensional
smelling
of
caramel
taste
is
comparable
to
the
aroma
with
a
malty
sweetness
matched
by
just
enough
hops
to
lend
balance
the
amalgam
precipitates
a
slight
cherrylike
tartness
near
the
back
end
thats
the
closest
thing
to
complexity
this
brew
has
to
offer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
perky
and
drinkableprobably
the
best
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
this
ultimately
comes
off
as
a
safe
and
nondescript
bock
which
is
less
than
desirable
for
a
style
i
already
find
to
be
pretty
underwhelming
low
b
another
solid
beer
from
new
glarus
o
was
hopping
for
better
scent
not
a
lot
there
but
the
velvety
carmel
taste
is
real
flavorful
nice
maibock
bubbly
and
thin
on
the
tongue
but
smooth
quite
lovely
o
i
am
more
than
willing
to
highly
rate
lagers
and
am
in
fact
happy
to
do
so
but
this
one
falls
a
bit
short
of
the
mark
looking
for
more
than
what
i
got
and
i
do
understand
that
it
doesnt
need
to
be
a
malt
bomb
still
decent
in
a
pinch
if
you
need
it
the
label
does
call
this
a
wisconsin
bock
but
the
beer
tastes
a
lot
more
like
a
dunkel
lager
than
a
bock
theres
a
smooth
bread
dark
bread
crust
and
light
caramel
malt
character
with
a
mild
bready
aroma
to
match
its
a
very
easy
drinking
beer

very
drinkable
beer
but
lacks
the
caramelization
of
most
bocks
overall
a
pretty
solid
bock
has
the
toasted
malty
flavor
expected
for
the
style
i
dont
love
the
bock
style
but
this
beer
sure
does
do
it
well
overall
its
very
flavorful
without
being
overpowering
it
is
scrumptious
i
had
one
at
room
temperature
the
other
night
and
it
was
much
better
that
way
try
it
unchilled
o
this
one
deserves
better
reviews
than
it
is
getting
to
my
mind
o
a
solid
bock
could
easily
knock
a
few
of
these
down
12
oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
dark
caramel
brown
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
light
tan
head
on
it
that
lingers
awhile
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
mainly
a
caramel
malt
but
also
hints
of
some
fruits
nuts
and
a
hint
of
roast
the
taste
is
good
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
caramel
malt
body
hints
of
spices
fruits
and
a
hint
of
dryness
in
the
finish
a
very
nice
beer
highly
enjoyable
i
normally
avoid
bock
at
all
costs
this
beer
is
truly
an
exception
german
brewers
take
note
of
this
one
o
overall
a
decent
bock
though
not
my
favorite
from
ng
some
nice
sweet
dark
fruit
in
the
taste
though
it
was
missing
in
the
nose
and
a
bit
too
thin
of
a
body
for
me
would
try
it
again
my
overall
impression
of
back
40
improves
over
time
swirling
out
some
of
the
carbonation
makes
the
beer
easier
to
drink
and
as
the
beer
warms
some
of
the
roughish
aspects
are
lessened
m
i
believe
this
is
the
perfect
body
for
a
bock
it
is
pretty
much
medium
but
not
too
crisp
and
not
too
heavy
good
aftertaste
and
coating
by
far
the
best
part
of
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
light
bodied
deep
mahogany
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
the
nose
is
typical
of
a
bock
slightly
sweet
malt
with
a
slight
nuttiness
the
flavors
are
initially
slightly
sweet
but
finish
dry
and
malty
its
on
par
for
the
style
it
drinks
light
and
somewhat
dry
its
ok
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
dark
brown
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
this
beer
was
really
quite
nice
the
aromas
of
dark
malts
and
bready
yeast
with
some
dark
fruits
in
there
too
a
unique
nose
on
this
beer
for
sure
the
taste
of
the
beer
wasnt
as
impressive
as
i
had
hoped
for
the
flavors
seemed
a
little
on
the
muted
side
nothing
really
popped
there
were
some
lager
yeastlike
flavors
in
there
and
mostly
a
dull
dark
malt
base
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
it
was
medium
bodied
with
decent
amount
of
bubbles
to
it
overall
i
felt
that
this
beer
just
needed
some
additional
malts
or
something
to
boost
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
just
a
bit
other
than
that
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
beer
is
fine
i
like
it
medium
to
light
in
body
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
a
decent
finish
on
the
whole
thing
enjoyable
but
not
overly
sweet
or
dry
on
the
finihs
id
have
it
again
pours
a
medium
caramel
color
with
a
short
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
some
very
faint
hops
and
a
bit
of
bready
plus
a
touch
of
caramel
flavor
is
pretty
similar
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
comes
through
not
bad
for
an
american
bock
the
beer
appears
a
clear
light
caramel
shade
of
brown
with
over
an
inch
of
dense
off
white
excellent
head
retention
and
ample
lacing
the
aroma
offers
brown
bread
malt
a
faint
hint
of
alcohol
light
in
body
simple
and
easy
to
drink
not
complex
per
se
but
enjoyable
and
sessionable
a
good
pairing
with
brats
and
sauerkraut
i
would
have
this
again
o
easy
drinking
beer
and
really
brings
out
the
toasted
flavored
malts
without
going
overboard
would
certainly
pick
this
beer
up
again
this
is
a
quality
bock
next
to
uffda
its
a
bit
simple
but
good
for
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
to
use
the
wellworn
ba
addage
solid
o
a
sufficient
bock
dthis
one
is
a
little
disappointing
for
me
im
left
wanting
more
body
and
a
bigger
malt
profile
appears
a
transparent
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
sporting
a
foamy
collar
that
lasts
for
about
a
minute
no
lacing
smells
of
semitoasted
malts
brown
sugar
nougat
bread
and
toffee
in
descending
order
of
strength
the
flavor
follows
the
noses
presentation
almost
in
perfect
lockstep
hops
present
only
as
a
floral
garnish
on
the
nose
and
as
earthy
tones
in
the
mid
sip
mediumlight
body
clean
finish
carbonated
appropriately
o
i
really
love
bocks
they
are
so
easy
to
drink
with
smooth
caramel
notes
this
is
also
a
great
beer
and
style
to
bring
women
into
craft
beer
just
have
to
convince
them
to
try
it
o
a
nice
thirst
quencher
but
not
much
in
other
departments
unfortunately
this
looked
a
lot
better
than
it
was
which
surprises
me
from
new
glarus
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
celebrator
tulipchalice
the
beer
pours
a
dark
copper
to
brown
color
with
a
fine
head
that
clung
to
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
bready
laced
with
caramel
and
fruit
smooth
and
malty
across
the
palate
lots
of
good
malty
action
in
the
flavor
bready
grainy
with
a
dash
of
sweetness
this
is
a
well
flavored
beer
a
nicely
made
clean
bock
o
a
very
nice
beer
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
beyond
belief
making
this
one
a
dangerously
easy
drinker
thanks
to
crass3000
for
this
one
i
was
given
a
bottle
of
the
back
40
from
my
boss
in
a
trade
of
beers
the
beer
poured
a
brownish
clear
amber
with
thin
slightly
off
white
head
that
left
a
nice
lace
on
my
glass
the
smell
included
rich
sweet
malt
the
taste
was
a
nice
malt
start
with
good
sweet
tones
that
turned
slightly
bitter
towards
then
end
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
medium
body
beer
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
another
great
creation
by
new
glarus
o
a
great
drinking
beer
that
went
down
exceptionally
smooth
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
o
this
is
truly
a
traditional
bock
more
so
than
uffda
but
it
also
seems
just
a
little
lackluster
overall
im
trying
to
harken
back
to
my
early
days
of
hunting
down
rhinelander
bock
each
spring
to
see
if
this
reminds
me
of
that
sort
of
beer
but
its
just
not
as
exciting
overall
this
is
a
good
drinker
and
goes
down
easy
but
it
just
seems
a
bit
lacking
i
might
have
to
revisit
on
another
day
a
nice
simple
domestic
rendition
of
the
style
o
this
was
a
nice
late
fall
selection
decent
transition
brew
to
your
winter
warmers
a
little
lighter
fair
than
ngs
uff
da
but
just
as
enjoyable
o
very
drinkable
great
for
a
tailgate
which
was
the
original
purpose
of
this
guy
overall
not
my
favorite
bock
from
new
glarus
i
think
this
one
really
pales
in
comparison
to
the
uffda
a
nice
easy
drinking
bock
but
nothing
in
the
way
of
complexity
or
depth
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
quite
a
punchy
carbonation
almost
a
bit
too
bubbly
for
me
but
it
still
goes
down
nicely
overall
just
a
solid
bock
from
new
glarus
and
im
not
surprised
as
theyve
brewed
plenty
of
great
bocks
in
the
past
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
can
only
hope
to
sample
more
from
this
brewer
cheers
drinkability
i
definitely
need
to
get
a
sixpack
of
this
the
next
time
it
is
in
season
very
good
stuff
if
it
is
this
good
on
an
85º
summer
night
i
bet
it
is
excellent
when
there
is
a
nice
chill
in
the
air
the
aroma
was
your
classic
malty
bock
nice
sweet
caramel
and
nutty
aromas
mixed
in
with
a
good
earthy
tone
the
flavor
followed
through
very
closely
with
a
nice
bitter
malty
flavor
and
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
in
it
as
well
carbonation
that
is
more
then
decent
never
let
it
go
flat
and
kept
you
entertained
throughout
the
session
easily
a
sessionable
beer
as
i
could
have
thrown
down
more
then
one
aromas
of
green
apple
grass
and
dark
bread
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
introduces
a
sharp
cider
crispness
subtle
sweet
maltiness
follows
with
suggestions
of
brown
sugar
and
biscuit
mild
hopping
balances
out
the
taste
profile
bright
effervescence
throughout
the
session
dry
finish
with
a
puckering
tartness
overall
back
forty
is
a
highly
sessionable
bock
with
a
robust
malt
character
thats
worth
exploring
o
goes
down
alright
somewhat
tasty
not
filling
mild
kick
ok
representation
of
style
this
was
cool
to
try
but
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
pours
a
muddied
chestnut
brown
with
a
frothy
two
fingers
of
foam
leaving
nice
lace
retention
the
nose
contains
rich
bready
malts
a
strong
grassy
herbal
hop
scent
with
almost
a
slight
sour
roasted
chocolate
note
the
taste
has
dry
chocolate
malt
upfront
with
the
slightest
sour
hint
finishes
with
dark
cacao
at
the
end
along
with
hay
refreshing
if
not
a
bit
thin
a
hearty
sessionable
beer
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
nice
nutty
brown
with
white
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
a
bit
toasty
and
nutty
first
taste
is
of
malty
bready
goodness
that
just
keeps
you
drinking
more
and
more
finishes
a
bit
nutty
as
well
did
i
say
nutty
lol
this
is
a
great
brew
definitely
something
i
could
drink
for
a
few
hours
with
the
boys
highly
recommended
poured
into
my
goddamn
aventinus
glass
and
the
beer
is
a
medium
brown
with
a
large
offwhite
head
lots
of
lace
and
great
head
retention
fairly
clear
overall
smell
is
quite
malty
like
a
bock
should
be
with
some
breadiness
taste
is
very
similar
but
more
subdued
which
is
a
surprise
quite
clean
in
flavor
and
finish
appropriately
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
be
quite
satisfied
a
solid
bock
from
new
glarus
o
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
the
whole
way
through
back
40
bock
is
highly
sessionable
and
really
easy
to
drink
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
its
still
crisp
and
refreshing
another
above
average
beer
from
new
glarus
overall
a
tasty
drinkable
beer
and
surely
underrated
dont
take
it
for
granted
pretty
weak
overall
id
expect
better
from
ng
o
decent
nice
malts
nothing
too
special
little

without

depth
or

its
just
kind
of
there
maybe
a
good
crossover
bock
for
the
macro
crowd
but
this
pales
in
comparison
to
the
uff

which
is
exceptional

of

in

a

somewhat
nutty
in

with

overall
not
a

of
strong

flavors
expected
drinks
fine
but
something
id
more
expect
to
experience
wearing
a
leinie
label
actually
i
think
i
prefer
their
1888
bock
to
this
run
of
the
mill
and
another
ng
beer
that
seems
dumbed
down
for
the
masses
like
their
honey
bock
o
an
average
bock
with
decent
aromas
and
flavors
overall
i
like
my
bock
a
little
richer
than
this
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
pick
from
the
new
glarus
stable
solid
good
bock
that
one
could
easily
be
taking
down
by
the
twos
threes
on
the
patio
in
the
springtime
nice
addition
to
the
new
glarus
line
one
id
consider
for
kicking
back
this
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
very
small
head
the
smell
was
rich
and
malt
and
had
a
doughy
oder
to
it
the
taste
was
full
and
had
a
doughy
malty
like
flavor
nice
feel
tot
he
beer
easy
to
drink
as
well
overall
a
very
nice
bock
would
get
this
one
again
d
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
even
though
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
id
probably
order
it
if
i
saw
it
on
draft
the
head
graces
the
glass
with
a
random
patchy
pattern
of
lace
muddled
brown
color
shows
some
chill
haze

hay

dark

the
nose
lagered
smoothness
unleashes
a
re
freshing
crispness
in
the
medium

sweet
toasted
bready
maltiness
is
the
tune
this
brew
is
singing
a
broad
reach
from
caramel
to
toasted
pie
crust
to
biscuits
modest
hopping
stretches
far
enough
to
balance
and
leaves
some
oily
herbal
flavor
in
the
drying
malty
end
wow
comes
to
mind
extremely
drinkable
with
a
tightly
packed
toasted
character
that
unfolds
with
each
sip
a
good
hunt
for
any
true
lager
lover
out
there
d
pretty
insanely
drinkable
but
then
it
is
only
5
5
abv
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
food
i
could
easily
see
myself
killing
a
six
pack
of
this
at
a
summer
cookout
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
pour
two
fingers
of
head
that
slowly
deflate
leaving
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
sweet
and
of
brown
spices
cinnamon
or
nutmeg
the
taste
is
crisp
sweet
and
creamy
caramel
and
mild
spices
mixed
with
something
leafy
and
fresh
d
this
is
very
drinkable
but
not
anything
i
would
go
searching
for
theres
just
nothing
special
about
this
beer
its
a
bit
tasteless
i
love
new
glarus
beers
but
this
one
just
doesnt
cut
it
i
do
know
a
lot
of
other
people
like
it
though
so
go
try
it
out
for
yourself
final
impression
lacks
aroma
and
flavor
this
is
the
stuff
that
makes
alcoholics
drink
ability
is
decent
overall
an
above
average
bock
but
doesnt
wow
on
any
fronts
pours
a
nice
burnt
sienna
with
a
pillowy
mochalike
head
of
foam
doesnt
appear
to
be
highly
carbonated
head
disapates
quickly
to
leave
a
touch
of
lace
smell
is
of
lightly
toasted
bread
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
yeasty
goodness
flavor
seems
to
vary
with
hints
of
prune
and
bran
cereal
touch
of
sweetness
rounds
out
the
flavor
profile
for
a
5
beer
this
is
packed
with
flavor
that
gets
a
bit
tiring
on
my
pallete
but
is
still
a
great
beer
as
winter
turns
to
spring
drink
this
is
one
you
will
take
large
drinks
of
and
you
will
want
more
than
one
a
bit
flat
in
the
feel
low
abv
makes
it
drinkable
but
i
think
takes
away
some
of
the
feel
drinkability
i
like
it
ok
but
it
isnt
something
id
anxiously
await
to
come
out
as
a
seasonal
release
d
tastes
like
warm
homemade
bread
in
a
good
way
very
comforting
and
soothing
after
a
long
day
the
drier
finish
and
restrained
flavors
makes
this
a
good
candidate
for
someone
to
try
who
doesnt
think
they
like
bock
beers
well
done
d
this
beer
i
could
see
on
a
draft
list
and
not
feel
that
it
is
anything
special
the
beer
is
competely
and
utterly
average
in
my
opinion
not
bad
but
not
good
and
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
that
considers
new
glarus
one
of
my
favorite
breweriess
d
this
is
a
decent
bock
but
there
are
better
out
there
very
sessionable
you
could
stock
a
sixer
as
a
regular
drinker
probably
not
as
good
as
the
uff
da
but
it
is
tasty
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
more
often
a
great
cheap
everyday
beer
that
would
shake
up
the
styles
i
usually
get
for
that
purpose
drinkability
fine
taste
is
ridiculously
clean
soft
fluffy
inviting
this
is
one
of
those
few
beers
where
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
are
so
tightly
knit
that
you
cant
really
review
them
separately
dark
fruits
and
dark
bready
malt
float
on
top
of
dry
fluffy
airy
carbonation
superbly
drinkable
hints
of
bread
crust
a
dash
of
cocoa
powder
and
a
faintly
earthy
figgy
note
the
hops
only
show
up
in
person
for
a
flash
on
the
fading
finish
leafy
and
floral
preferring
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
time
providing
that
fantastic
dry
ultra
clean
light
sensation
that
counterbalances
the
malt
body
really
unique
the
flavor
profile
really
is
subdued
and
id
rate
it
lower
if
it
wasnt
so
well
done
and
didnt
feel
so
well
right
top
to
bottom
a
beautiful
beer
i
would
by
this
by
the
case
if
i
lived
close
enough
not
bad
and
quite
drinkable
if
consumed
at
the
proper
temperature
this
beer
has
great
drinkability
with
an
appropriately
clean
slightly
sweet
and
satisfying
finish
the
beer
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
grass
and
some
molasses
it
smells
about
like
a
bock
should
the
flavor
is
toffee
grass
and
chocolate
the
beer
is
also
very
dry
not
sweet
like
a
lot
of
bocks
are
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
decent
but
i
expect
more
from
new
glarus
drinkability
for
the
uninitiated
wisconsin
is
the
standard
bearer
of
bock
biers
in
the
us
and
new
glarus
is
the
standard
bearer
of
craft
beer
in
wisconsin
somehow
it
just
doesnt
come
together
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
for
certain
but
theres
not
much
flavor
not
my
favorite
new
glarus

i
loved
back
in

continue
to
influence
my
perceptions
cant
help
but
think
more
and
more
new
glarus
has
shrewdly
built
a
larger
than
reality
reputation
on
the
strength
of
the
extreme
provincialism
in
wi
and
the
desire
for
unavailable
things
elsewhere
in
other
words
they
sell
to
the
prideful
locals
and
boost
their
rep
by
not
selling
to
the
nonlocals
still
dig
their
crackd
wheat
and
maybe
a
couple
others

if
their

this

could

despite
the

which
makes
no

to
me
finishes
clean
new
glarus
has
yet
to
brew
anything
i
didnt
truly
love
sessionable
for
a
bock
yummy
even
drinks
rather
easily
and
represents
the
style
pretty
well
however
it
just
doesnt
have
a
real
strong
presence
in
the
nose
and
taste
department
worth
a
shot
very
drinkable
i
dont
think
this
was
quite
as
good
as
uffda
but
a
different
beer
altogether
not
complex
but
wellbalanced
and
pairs
well
with
a
cold
winter
night
its
gorgeous
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
what
im
looking
for
from
a
bock
at
all
im
surprised
this
one
was
able
to
retain
as
much
flavor
for
the
lower
abv
worth
a
try
pours
a
somewhat
murky
dark
brown
huge
thick
tan
head
malty
sweet
smell
with
a
touch
of
maple
and
toffee
used
coffee
grounds
the
taste
is
slghtly
sweet
with
more
of
a
grainy
corn
flavor
i
pick
up
something
kind
of
like
raw
oatmeal
there
is
a
clean
toated
malt
flavor
throughout
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
makes
the
aftertaste
a
little
fruity
i
can
taste
a
twang
from
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
and
wet
for
something
with
this
depth
of
flavor
overall
a
decent
beer
the
flavor
is
complex
and
pretty
well
balanced
good
drinkability
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
warm
you
up
on
a
ten
degree
night
thanks
again
to
the
crew
at
new
glarus
i
dont
think
this
bock
lives
up
to
the
uffda
that
being
said
uffda
was
a
a
much
different
bock
easy
to
drink
with
nice
mouth
feel
well
done
but
not
my
favorite
style
well
certainly
not
a
bad
bock
the
flavor
leaves
you
wanting
more
that
said
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
would
have
no
problem
knocking
back
a
few
of
them
enjoyable
but
this
one
definitely
wont
blow
your
socks
off
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
tint
one
finger
of
head
that
slowly
settled
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
spotty
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
mild
aroma
with
hints
of
caramel
figs
and
raisins
maybe
a
little
charcoal
as
well
the
first
sip
i
thought
i
tasted
some
smoke
but
that
did
not
come
back
as
i
worked
through
the
glass
the
flavor
is
mostly
caramel
with
some
faint
hints
of
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
just
not
very
interesting
or
complex
the
body
feels
bigger
that
it
is
and
is
nicely
carbonated
new
glarus
gets
the
mouthfeel
right
in
just
about
every
beer
do
not
understand
the
need
to
introduce
this
bock
when
they
already
have
one
of
the
best
uffda
in
the
portfolio
just
bring
that
one
back
this
is
just
average
well
made
but
average
this
pours
a
dark
brown
and
cloudy
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
of
caramel
and
pastry
with
a
bit
of
sour
tart
in
it
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
mostly
malty
with
a
slightly
sour
tart
finish
it
drinks
very
light
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
deeper
d
a
fantastic
bock
great
flavor
balance
and
feel
without
being
too
bold
a
clean
tasting
and
easy
drinking
bock
i
still
miss
uffda
but
this
is
quite
good
easier
drinking
for
the
style
overall
this
seems
to
fit
what
i
understand
a
bock
to
be
to
a
t
its
certainly
not
a
dopplebock
but
the
family
traits
are
there
if
only
at
a
less
intense
level
the
one
extreme
virtue
that
this
seems
to
have
is
its
drinkability
pretty
much
par
for
the
course
for
new
glarus
pretty
nice
beer
overall
not
outstanding
in
any
way
but
good
bring
back
uffda
i
had
high
hopes
that
they
would
have
replaced
uffda
with
a
similar
tasting
bock
although
i
almost
lost
hope
after
tasting
cabin
fever
i
understand
why
new
glarus
is
making
these
least
common
denominator
beers
but
it
pains
me
to
know
this
was
at
the
expense
of
uffda
a
real
wisconsin
bock
needs
some
body
and
bold
flavor
d
on
the
sweet
side
making
me
not
want
more
than
1
in
a
sitting
this
new
seasonal
from
new
glarus
is
a
must
try
for
new
glarus
fans
it
pours
a
dark
brown
color
and
has
that
familar
bock
smell
to
it
this
beer
starts
out
with
a
semi
strong
bock
taste
but
finishes
very
nicely
with
little
after
taste
pretty
smooth
and
nice
flavor
definetly
a
good
taste
for
the
price
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
better
than
other
wisconsin
bocks
moderately
low
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
nice
and
smooth
overall
back
40
bock
is
easy
to
drink
with
very
clean
malt
flavors
and
not
its
not
too
strong
making
it
a
nice
sessionable
beer
for
fall
much
as
i
suspected
not
as
good
as
uffda
but
far
tastier
than
cabin
fever
bit
of
a
letdown
its
trying
to
be
a
bock
style
of
beer
imho
despite
what
the
label
says
i
believe
the
caramel
flavor
is
fake
or
enhanced
the
flavor
dissipates
across
the
palate
nicely
sweetness
is
adequate
low
end
of
carbonation
scale
and
initial
mouthful
is
pleasing
and
fruity
just
not
rich
enough
in
body
and
not
satisfying
enough
note
i
lived
in
germany
for
about
10
years
and
have
sampled
many
beers
in
this
genre
so
without
trying
to
sound
like
a
snob
i
speak

some
perspective

the
hops
neither
dominates
makes
for
a
smooth
easy
drinking
lager
finishes
long
and
strong
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
worth
looking
for
first
time
ive
tried
a
beer
from
holsten
not
much
going
on
in
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
too
bad
o
a
tasty
bock
and
a
pleasant
surprise
from
this
brewery
te
flavors
fit
the
style
but
theres
a
few
tweaks
needed
to
make
to
push
this
into
the
next
category
for
points
again
not
a
bad
brew
from
holsten
and
worth
a
try
od
a
touch
sweet
and
unstructured
with
some
off
bits
but
alot
better
than
expected
some
nice
complexity
hanging
around
with
some
rich
malt
character
not
bad
its
okay
better
than
the
maibock
but
certainly
not
among
the
best
bocks
ive
encountered
but
if
getting
sloshed
oktoberfeststyle
is
your
aim
you
could
do
worse
update
dammmnnn
be
sure
to
drink
this
beer
cold
my
last
two
mouthfuls
warmed
up
while
i
was
writing
the
review
and
now
it
tastes
like
strongly
fermented
athletes
foot
for
a
cheap
bock
or
high
abv
single
can
thats
easy
to
find
even
in
liquorboardcontrolled
areas
of
canada
this
isnt
too
bad
but
id
never
specifically
look
for
it
doubt
ill
get
it
again
drink
the
beer
had
some
promise
when
i
first
poured
it
into
my
glass
the
appearance
is
actually
pretty
good
but
the
taste
is
just
dreadful
its
almost
undrinkable
life
is
too
short
to
spend
time
drinking
beers
like
this
one
holsten
festbock
stands
as
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
local
liquor
store
it
has
a
nice
dark
color
an
excellent
creamy
head
and
a
very
smooth
taste
i
am
surprised
at
the
low
price
of
this
brand
overall
it
feels
like
a
beer
that
you
would
be
served
in
a
nice
pub
to
accompany
your
meal
i
have
chosen
on
almost
every
occasion
to
drink
this
brand
pours
a
dark
reddishorange
with
a
finger
of
brown
head
that
fizzles
like
cola
to
nothing
no
head
retained
no
lace
nose
of
dark
bread
mild
dark
fruits
touch
of
roast
sweet
malts
taste
follows
more
dark
bread
again
with
the
sweet
malts
light
dry
and
dark
fruits
float
around
as
well
relatively
indiscriminate
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
but
a
fairly
reasonable
mouthfeel
overall
good
drinkability
for
the
alcohol
content
and
often
a
decent
choice
at
the
lcbo
in
lieu
of
some
of
the
other
subpar
offerings
always
found
there
edit
consumed
on
111710
can
poured
into
a
beer
mug
bottom
on
can
dated
052011
and
found
the
sweet
malt
well
balanced
as
with
everything
the
time
and
place
affect
your
perceptions
otoh
i
found
the
carbonation
to
be
too
low
affecting
mouthfeel
negatively
pours
a
nice
dark
red
brown
with
a
decent
head
thats
gone
very
quick
and
weak
lacing
good
carbonation
and
nice
caramelized
taste
to
it
with
some
grains
and
a
slightly
roasted
taste
this
beer
goes
down
very
well
for
a
strong
beer
and
at
only
7
percent
abv
its
drinkability
is
pretty
good
aftertaste
is
pleasant
and
the
overall
experience
is
pretty
good
too
medium
body
and
carbonation
a
little
sweet
for
a
big
session
but
better
than
the
maibock
in
that
regard
a
500ml
can
of
7
is
not
to
be
taken
lightly
another
one
of
my
fave
winter
brews
though
overall
great
beer
saw
the
thread
on
beer
brats
and
decided
to
make
my
own
half
this
can
is
in
the
pan
as
we
speak
d
at
7
abv
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
not
unpleasant
the
flavours
are
strong
but
the
do
balance
somehow
a
decent
offering
for
cheap
high
test
this
is
pretty
good
i
seem
too
remember
not
liking
the
maibock
as
much
as
this
but
ill
have
to
go
back
and
check
my
review
deep
copper
red
with
a
large
and
fast
dissipating
tan
head
no
lace
weak
caramel
malt
bread
and
raisin
aroma
sweet
toffee
flavour
with
a
little
bit
of
raisin
and
a
mild
bitterness
to
the
finish
theres
a
slight
antiseptic
character
as
it
warms
that
i
find
unpleasant
almost
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
syrupy
but
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
mediocre
finished
it
probably
wont
buy
it
again
definately
wont
recommend
it
i
havent
had
too
much
like
this
so
perhaps
id
get
more
out
of
it
if
i
were
used
to
the
style
but
i
wasnt
particularly
impressed
with
this
beer
drinkability
naaah
id
go
for
one
at
a
time
a
wierd
beer
that
has
its
pros
and
cons
i
respect
it
but
i
really
wonder
if
i
would
ever
buy
one
again
this
is
my
third
and
last
ever
beer
from
holsten
id
rather
drink
from
a
toilet
holsten
festbock
is
certainly
nothing
to
celebrate
the
only
people
rejoicing
here
will
be
those
who
enjoy
high
octane
moderately
tasteless
beers
that
provide
a
quick
relatively
cheap
means
of
getting
alcohol
to
the
brain
it
would
seem
to
me
given
its
entire
lack
of
distinguishing
or
redeeming
qualities
that
thats
exactly
the
kind
of
people
for
whom
this
beer
was
brewed
unless
youre
part
of
that
crowd
id
recommend
a
pass
on
the
festivities
overall
drinkability
the
moutfeel
supports
chugging
the
taste
grows
on
one
and
i
would
probably
drink
it
slowly
if
i
was
in
for
an
interesting
time
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
if
offered
i
would
get
it
again
refreshing
enough
and
pretty
tame
on
the
booziness
quotient
for
the
style
which
is
a
good
thing
in
my
estimation
simple
sure
but
at
3
bucks
or
so
a
can
which
around
here
is
a
dealio
yo
you
get
your
basic
style
and
moneys
worth
for
certain
d
i
think
with
the
higher
alcvol
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
over
a
long
timeframe
but
it
would
definitely
have
its
consequences
its
not
a
great
beer
but
rather
a
decent
one
i
will
probably
buy
this
again
when
out
with
friends
sometime
the
taste
further
confused
me
and
i
dont
want
to
say
that
this
beer
is
complex
its
not
really
sweet
sugary
malt
reminded
me
of
splenda
or
some
artificial
sweetener
blueberries
raspberries
some
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
were
subtle
alcohol
kind
of
an
odd
taste
starts
with
a
nice
dark
chocolatey
taste
very
rich
a
bit
of
berries
something
not
quite
right
about
it
though
kind
of
a
metallic
twang
cough
syrup
maybe
leaves
behind
a
toasty
chocolatey
taste
its
good
overall
but
theres
just
something
odd
in
there
surprised
i
cant
taste
the
extra
alcohol
maybe
thats
why
the
winos
like
it
heavy
mouthfeel
but
ultimately
smooth
pretty
drinkable
but
i
bet
these
things
would
sneak
up
on
you
pretty
quickly
cheers
got
thiis
500ml
can
at
the
nearby
supermercado
carrefour
here
in
recoleta
buenos
aires
last
week
and
trying
it
now
poured
with
a
big
tan
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
hint
of
head
and
barely
any
lace
dark
mahogany
color
aroma
is
dark
sweet
malt
and
dark
ripe
fruits
flavor
is
very
similar
shallow
bit
watery
in
spite
of
the
heavy
sweet
malt
theyre
definitely
not
brewing
this
for
flavor
or
aesthetics
might
be
fun
to
add
a
vinegar
culture
to
it
since
its
an
all
malt
product
finish
is
not
worth
coming
back
to
worth
a
try
definitely
an
after
supper
sipping
beer
given
its
high
booze
content
drinkeability
sticky
sweet
finish
and
offputting
flavour
really
limit
this
brews
potential
final
thoughts
all
in
all
this
beer
would
be
a
welcome
alternative
to
a
stout
it
really
needs
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
maybe
a
touch
less
richness
but
all
in
all
id
grab
another
if
it
was
cheap
or
on
tap
definitely
an
excellent
nursing
beer
whose
high
alcohol
i
personally
feel
only
improves
its
resume
my
pour
got
me
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
with
decent
retention
the
color
was
a
deep
dark
colacolored
brown
with
little
light
penetration
the
nose
had
a
caramellicorice
scent
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lot
of
anise
and
chocolate
on
the
tongue
the
finish
had
a
sweetishchocolatesmoky
quality
yum
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
thin
tan
head
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
sweet
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
with
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
taste
is
similar
with
malt
up
front
followed
by
a
slight
hoppy
sour
taste
medium
carbonation
smooth
body
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
so
the
high
abv
can
sneak
up
on
you
goes
down
nicely
so
i
had
to
remind
myself
of
the
percentage
before
i
cracked
open
my
second
of
the
night
i
tried
this
beer
on
january
3
2008
after
purchasing
from
a
toronto
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
dark
brown
colour
with
a
thin
tan
coloured
head
the
aroma
was
malty
with
some
sweet
and
spicy
tones
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
the
flavour
was
dry
malty
a
bit
spicy
and
a
little
hoppy
finish
good
carbonation
easy
on
the
mouth
nice
and
drinkable
despite
the
abv
not
a
bad
beer
better
than
the
maibock
not
bad
i
guess
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
since
the
last
thing
from
holsten
i
tried
was
their
maibock
i
was
not
as
impressed
with
that
one
i
could
definitely
down
a
few
of
these
and
i
look
forward
to
my
next
one
this
one
id
actually
drink
again
although
id
probably
purchase
it
solely
for
a
food
pairing
since
its
not
a
common
style
here
brown
pour
with
an
off
whitelight
tan
head
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
some
sweet
malt
in
the
aroma
a
very
straightforward
combination
of
sweet
malt
flavors
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
not
complex
kind
of
like
a
dumbed
down
spaten
optimator
i
am
not
sure
if
i
would
call
this
an
altbier
it
seems
to
belong
more
in
one
of
the
bockdoppelbockdunkel
categories
because
of
its
malty
profile
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
this
beer
again
d
not
a
bad
beer
its
drinkable
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
offered
to
me
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
roasted
barley
vied
for
attention
with
a
metallic
twang
though
the
metallic
taste
subsided
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
and
black
licorice
and
a
subtle
port
flavour
came
through
overall
the
taste
was
a
little
muted
but
pleasant
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
were
middle
of
the
road
which
neither
hurt
nor
helped
not
bad
at
all
im
not
sure
about
it
falling
into
the
altbier
style
it
seems
to
be
a
bit
hard
to
classify
this
beer
is
somewhat
odd
but
i
did
enjoy
it
though
i
like
a
decent
dark
beer
but
i
dont
understand
this
one
scored
as
high
as
it
did
just
macro
brown
stuff
no
thanks
santé
this
stuff
tastes
pretty
good
the
flavors
comes
to
me
in
the
following
order
sweet
maltyhoppy
alcohol
a
very
slight
dark
fruit
flavor
and
then
sweetness
at
the
very
back
of
the
tongue
barelypresent
sulfurous
taste
edit
new
can
im
drinking
now
has
no
hint
of
sulfur
the
beer
is
probably
a
610
on
the
heaviness
despite
the
moderately
high
alcohol
i
feel
this
would
make
a
stellar
session
beer
if
you
are
any
good
with
timing
d
i
would
have
another
if
you
are
buying
in
the
meantime
there
are
many
other
beers
to
try
before
returning
to
this
one
it
wont
be
long
before
i
drink
this
beer
again
overall
this
beer
has
its
flaws
in
terms
of
strong
beer
i
find
it
better
then
maibock
would
recommend
clear
and
very
dark
with
ruby
highlights
the
short
beige
head
produces
a
bit
of
lace
and
settles
quickly
to
a
thin
cap
malty
toffee
aroma
with
plenty
of
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
licorice
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
sweet
and
malty
with
mild
bitterness
that
lingers
in
the
finish
theres
quite
a
bit
of
licorice
here
as
well
offdry
finish
with
slight
warming
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
the
licorice
character
was
a
little
unexpected
but
quite
nice
this
dark
brew
poured
with
a
finger
thick
head
smell
is
rather
metallic
not
the
most
appetizing
but
there
are
worse
smells
taste
is
smooth
slight
bitterness
with
a
malt
undertone
mouthfeel
is
unoffensive
and
the
smoothness
makes
it
pretty
good
to
drink
the
high
abv
is
well
masked
but
this
can
be
dangerous
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
nice
ruby
highlights
and
a
one
finger
dark
tan
head
that
dissipates
fairly
slowly
and
leaves
little
lacing
smells
unremarkable
some
hoppiness
overlying
a
malty
background
taste
however
is
a
whole
different
ballgame
chocolate
and
licorice
dominate
with
burnt
malts
and
caramel
coming
through
as
well
before
a
bitter
finish
with
more
chocolate
and
some
hops
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rewarding
but
a
bit
syrupy
and
drinkability
is
very
nice
surprisingly
good
given
the
very
reasonable
price
d
very
drinkable
overall
quite
good
although
the
lackluster
smells
detract
from
the
experience
a
beer
readily
available
in
many
liquor
stores
here
and
another
one
i
somewhat
overlooked
far
too
many
times
because
it
was
in
the
import
500ml
can
area
in
liquor
stores
again
though
this
is
a
great
brew
poured
a
mollasses
brown
from
the
green
500ml
can
with
a
little
head
that
only
remained
as
a
ring
around
the
edges
sheets
of
lacing
that
move
quickly
the
aroma
for
me
is
the
best
part
of
bocks
ahh
malty
sweetness
some
cola
mollasses
caramel
some
wood
smells
a
little
chocolate
and
some
prunes
dusty
thick
malts
is
the
aroma
and
i
love
it
lactose
subtle
cream
licorice
and
red
wine
i
absolutely
adore
the
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
thin
maybe
a
little
too
watery
but
still
flavourful
dark
malts
cola
and
rootbeer
with
some
licorice
in
the
finish
not
overly
complex
but
sweet
and
fortifying
a
great
winter
sipper
there
is
a
taste
of
tree
sap
or
wet
wood
toosomewhat
hard
to
describe
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
with
medium
carbonation
an
absence
of
any
strong
alcohol
flavours
and
a
soft
mouthfeel
rate
this
high
for
drinkability
give
me
these
all
winter
night
nothing
overly
exciting
here
but
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
in
its
category
pours
a
dark
almost
opaque
colour
with
a
slight
reddish
tinge
looks
almost
like
dr
pepper
nice
fizzy
head
but
it
subsides
to
a
slight
lace
very
quickly
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
just
a
very
slight
maltiness
taste
is
really
quite
pleasant
lightly
hopped
nearly
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
roasted
malts
are
quite
prevalent
like
a
mild
stout
still
though
not
much
in
the
way
of
complexity
perhaps
some
mild
cherryplum
flavours
but
in
the
background
nice
bite
on
the
tongue
alcohol
is
well
hidden
slides
down
real
easy
this
is
really
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
usually
like
black
in
color
dark
red
in
the
light
nice
tan
head
fades
too
quickly
smells
skunky
like
a
rolling
rock
or
something
hay
horse
blanket
barnyard
smells
too
very
light
bodied
with
a
clean
finish
taste
is
peaty
and
sweetish
surprisingly
drinkable
and
at
7
enough
to
be
dangerous
very
graceful
alcohol
overallis
this
a
true
altbier
more
like
a
dark
double
bock
and
not
a
bad
one
either
definitely
worth
a
try
this
has
become
my
winter
beer
it
is
full
bodied
full
flavoured
it
is
a
very
malty
beverage
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
remove
any
cloying
sweetness
it
is
a
little
darker
and
not
as
sweet
as
a
salvator
its
an
interesting
beer
not
mindblowing
but
interesting
pours
an
almost
black
color
with
some
dark
rum
glints
the
head
is
tan
and
rocky
leaving
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
toasted
bread
raisins
plums
and
hop
bitterness
the
taste
is
a
nice
toasty
malitiness
with
plums
and
anise
notes
theres
also
a
nicely
perceptable
hoppiness
the
abv
of
this
beer
definitely
makes
itself
visible
it
tastes
stronger
than
other
beers
of
this
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
well
carbonated
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
though
definitely
too
strong
rich
and
crisp
to
be
an
alt
id
say
this
is
a
bock
lager
can
poured
a
dark
brown
beer
with
a
nice
above
average
head
with
good
retention
aroma
is
a
mix
of
malt
and
mild
sweetness
taste
was
quite
nice
with
some
smooth
malt
and
a
subtle
sweet
finish
with
a
good
banana
taste
at
the
ends
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
is
always
nice
the
thin
body
and
the
subtle
watery
aftertaste
was
bit
of
a
letdown
but
overall
i
think
this
was
a
nice
offering
from
a
macro
brewers

a
bit
underrated
i
feel
canned

nice
mellow

sweetbut
not
cloying
uncomplicated
taste
and
a
cleanish
finish
with
a
sweet
doughy
after
taste
not
a
bad
simple
bock
from
a
german
mega
brewer
fairly
satisfying
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
mass
produced
german
lager
that
does
not
suck
the
beer
is
dark
and
sufficiently
malty
to
make
me
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
heineken
dark
this
beer
will
never
be
a
favourite
but
for
the
price
of
2
a
can
it
is
not
too
shabby
i
could
have
done
with
more
balance
and
deeper
flavour
but
i
go
to
ayinger
or
paulaner
for
their
fest
beers
for
the
best
quality
an
enjoyable
beer
but
so
middleoftheroad
average
it
hurts
i
wont
recommend
it
to
anyone
but
i
wont
turn
down
an
offer
either
a
sidenote
in
the
ruhrgebiet
area
of
germany
altbier
was
usually
suggested
as
served
with
cola
first
thing
i
thought
of
when
i
poured
this
thx
a
very
dark
brown
smooth
strong
ale
a
pleasant
and
inviting
light
brown
head
wonderful
high
quality
candy
smell
does
that
make
sense
that
is
very
friendly
i
hate
candy
and
tasty
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
but
very
comfortable
and
down
she
goes
its
hard
to
peg
nothing
fancy
but
it
went
well
with
my
lunch
id
drink
this
again
but
ya
know
its
almost
too
smooth
got
to
go
so
i
can
finish
this
beer
from
a
500ml
can
with
the
freshness
date
stamped
on
the
bottom
what
a
dark
ale
a
deep
mahogany
decent
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
with
minor
lacing
smells
of
faint
roasted
hops
and
a
fair
amount
of
licorice
i
like
that
ive
brewed
a
couple
of
licorice
ales
in
my
time
but
have
never
come
across
a
commercial
equivalent
the
flavour
is
malty
and
boozy
a
bit
of
licorice
somewhat
watery
for
the
abv
but
goes
down
easy
an
average
strong
beer
nothing
that
really
wows
me
but
drinkable
nonetheless
a
few
of
these
could
go
down
easily
and
lead
to
trouble
an
average
bock
beer
that
is
decent
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
dont
really
taste
the
7
alcohol
which
is
good
however
i
probably
need
to
partake
more
in
this
style
of
beer
to
develop
a
taste
and
appreciation
for
it
im
a
fan
of
the
bock
concept
with
the
doppelbocks
aventinus
and
celebrator
clearly
leading
the
ways
in
my
book
but
with
the
price
of
those
at
24
times
higher
holstens
is
a
nice
alternative
when
youve
already
got
the
important
money
wrapped
up
in
the
premium
brews
this
beer
was
a
major
surprize
in
a
positive
way
the
appearance
when
poured
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
the
appearance
seemed
heavy
and
syrupy
but
it
was
not
the
body
was
full
with
a
glass
clinging
light
foam
the
taste
is
well
balanced
with
an
almost
almond
flavour
mouthfeel
as
well
was
above
average
an
impressive
brew
not
sure
if
i
got
the
right
style
its
a
strong
dark
german
ale
not
too
heavy
or
thick
with
a
strong
nutty
taste
the
alcohol
content
though
high
was
well
masked
and
i
was
actually
quite
surprised
when
i
noticed
it
on
the
can
the
drinkability
i
had
to
downgrade
because
of
the
morning
after
to
rub
that
in
i
had
24
hour
train
ride
i
quite
liked
the
taste
however
and
if
the
circumstances
of
my
first
experience
were
better
i
would
be
sure
to
make
this
a
regular
of
mine
overll
a
pretty
decent
beer
this
one
has
strong
boozy
flavour
that
does
detract
from
the
other
elements
slightly
and
a
cloying
finish
having
said
that
there
is
a
good
malt
profile
and
if
given
this
beer
again
i
would
not
turn
it
down
cheers
note
im
not
much
a
bock
drinker
so
im
adjusting
to
these
kinds
of
flavors
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
quite
a
treat
for
a
discounted
2
dollar
purchase
in
fact
i
think
i
like
it
more
than
the
winter
bock
since
the
abv
is
more
session
able
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
leading
this
to
have
a
smooth
though
slightly
stagnant
mouthfeel
some
more
carbonation
would
not
be
problematic
and
this
beers
weight
could
certainly
handle
it
closes
quite
dry
with
surprisingly
little
stickiness
across
the
palate
o
this
is
beer
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
is
also
quite
easy
to
drink
compared
to
other
bocks
o
this
beer
is
a
malt
forward
beer
with
a
little
sweetness
but
an
overall
good
balance
pours
a
murky
dark
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
toffee
and
some
slight
soy
sauce
notes
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
and
some
burnt
caramel
and
toffee
flavors
there
is
a
slight
alcohol
kick
with
each
sip
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
better
taste
than
smell
in
my
opinion
rjt
o
spices
override
all
other
flavors
initially
this
brew
comes
across
as
a
tad
unruly
with
alcohol
the
dominant
presence
both
in
aroma
and
taste
by
the
second
third
and
forth
gulp
the
hops
begin
to
assert
themselves
and
take
center
stage
the
amberorange
color
stands
alone
in
the
beer
world
i
had
to
keep
looking
at
it
and
holding
it
to
different
lights
and
upgrading
my
initial
appearance
rating
the
taste
is
extremely
complex
that
too
required
a
raise
in
points
the
ample
malt
body
never
achieves
a
platform
of
its
own
it
instead
plays
a
wonderful
supporting
role
to
the
competing
stars
the
off
white
heads
performance
is
marvelous
though
brief
einbecker
by
the
way
is
the
inventor
of
the
bock
style
because
i
was
unsure
of
my
ability
to
accurately
rate
this
unusual
style
beer
with
one
bottle
i
found
it
necessary
drink
a
second
330
ml
bottle
beatiful
amber
reddish
colour
no
dark
at
all
light
head
that
fades
quickly
no
lace
smell
am
i
the
one
who
fin
the
typical
burton
ale
sulphur
here
that
alongside
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
molasses
medium
body
really
good
palate
taste
of
caramel
chocolate
roasted
fruits
prunes
really
good
one
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
bock
beers
that
ive
had
in
my
time
and
id
rather
have
this
than
some
other
choices
on
the
market
today
had
this
on
tap
at
the
bavarian
lodge
the
menu
states
that
einbecker
originated
the
bock
style
but
i
think
others
have
done
this
better
anyone
remember
leinies
bock
from
the
80s
the
beer
seemed
bright
for
the
style
and
had
some
harshness
there
was
little
of
the
caramel
overtone
that
you
have
in
most
bocks
this
beer
scored
better
than
average
only
because
i
like
bocks
a
thoroughly
mediocre
beer
that
is
certainly
drinkable
but
not
particularly
memorable
it
certainly
does
not
justify
its
price
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
doubt
i
will
do
so
again
overall
a
classic
of
the
style
need
to
try
it
fresh
over
in
germany
some
time
never
quite
sure
how
fresh
it
is
in
the
green
bottles
thousands
of
miles
from
the
brewery
einbecker
urbock
dunkel
is
stereotypically
german
in
that
its
been
meticulously
brewed
according
to
a
conventional
longestablished
recipe
and
accustomed
level
of
quality
and
is
efficiently
engineered
for
a
culturally
prescribed
and
expected
degree
of
easy
drinkability
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
in
fact
thats
exactly
the
reason
i
bought
it
o
not
sure
about
this
one
some
things
i
really
like
while
others
i
really
dont
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
are
not
great
but
the
taste
and
appearance
appeal
to
me
d
very
easy
drinking
pours
a
clear
red
mahogany
with
about
a
finger
of
head
fading
soon
after
no
aroma
to
speak
of
which
is
a
bit
disappointing
fairly
complex
flavor
though
with
a
good
mix
of
fruit
perhaps
apple
and
plum
decent
caramel
and
a
touch
of
spice
somewhat
chewy
in
the
mouth
though
not
necessarily
full
bodied
and
slightly
bitter
and
wet
on
the
finish
an
enjoyable
brew
with
the
flavor
making
up
for
some
of
its
less
refined
qualities
it
is
balanced
to
my
surprise
still
the
hops
sting
the
palate
with
its
bitterness
could
the
green
bottle
have
influenced
this
light
on
the
caramel
and
raisin
with
a
lot
of
oily
bitterness
stinging
and
lingering
on
decent
enough
to
drink
but
in
summary
a
let
down
pours
amberdark
brown
color
with
medium
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
floral
taste
is
citrus
hops
on
the
front
end
balanced
by
a
nice
bready
malt
sweetness
that
lasts
into
a
strong
aftertaste
the
beer
is
light
to
mediumbodied
with
a
pleasant
fine
texture
very
good
beer
from
a
classic
brewery
could
use
some
complexity
and
lushness
but
not
bad
overall
a
rich
and
flavorful
beer
that
has
a
little
throat
burn
that
sneaks
up
on
you
this
is
a
very
drinkable
bock
true
to
its
style
i
would
say
i
would
classify
this
as
a
reliable
goto
pick
for
a
heartier
lager
12
oz
bottle
pours
amber
with
a
lasting
white

nice
aroma

piny

and
caramel

full
slightly
crisp

light
carbonation
large
amount
of
floral
hops
on
the
palate
perfectly
balanced
by
caramel

some
hints
of
citrus

as
well
long
balanced
finish
becomes
dry
in
the
end
ur
bock
indeed
i
forgot
what
i
paid
per
bottle
anyway
its
a
beer
that
would
be
in
the
everyday
catagory
a
nice
change
of
style
to
reach
for
drinkability
pretty
easy
to
drink
at
the
right
temperaturevery
important
as
the
alcohol
can
get
annoying
if
its
too
warm
the
alcohol
may
sneak
up
on
one
but
so
long
as
no
driving
is
involved
i
see
no
reason
not
to
drink
in
quantity
this
is
one
of
the
few
i
buy
by
the
case
and
offer
to
my
friends
to
get
to
know
the
style
very
drinkable
its
refreshing
and
clean
bittersweet
like
a
good
dark
beer
should
be
this
is
a
good
beer
it
is
slightly
thicker
maltier
than
most
beer
but
it
is
not
overbearing
d
green
glass
issues
aside
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
toasty
and
tasty
bock
not
a
chugger
bitterness
makes
this
a
true
sipper
and
the
in
your
face
alcohol
makes
this
a
one
and
done
for
the
night
very
good
for
the
style
well
made
beer
d
having
the
maibock
and
this
back
to
back
for
me
the
maibock
is
the
the
superior
brew
its
more
balanced
the
hops
come
out
more
but
i
can
see
the
malthead
liking
this
more
its
pushing
on
that
dopplebock
door
a
beer
that
really
needs
some
food
to
go
with
it
drinkability
good
beer
in
general
somewhat
of
a
good
example
of
a
bock
in
general
perhaps
a
little
too
filling
to
come
back
to
too
often
in
one
night
but
certainly
complex
enough
to
be
entertaining
once
a
night
the
aftertaste
is
especially
good
a
historic
lager
and
while
the
descendents
of
traditional
bock
are
superior
in
many
ways
this
is
still
well
worth
sampling
an
excellent
unobtrusive
beer
perfect
with
a
variety
of
german
foods
d
easy
to
drink
poured
a
clear
brown
body
with
minimal
head
that
dies
quickly
a
sharp
piney
hop
smell
with
a
good
breadynutty
malt
smell
as
well
a
lighter
bock
almost
mediumbodied
with
a
dry
roasted
malt
taste
with
some
biscuitiness
as
well
as
some
sharp
hops
for
minor
balance
semisweet
caramel
and
sugar
malts
come
out
on
backend
for
a
sticky
sensation
and
a
somewhat
sweet
finish
a
decent
bock
but
i
prefer
them
stronger
nothing
too
complex
here
but
a
solid
offering
stylistically
nonetheless
perhaps
a
little
commercialized
for
the
modern
german
beerdrinkers
palate
it
doesnt
display
the
complexity
that
some
more
traditional
examples
do
despite
its
bearing
the
namesake
of
bock
itself
taste
is
excellent
very
fruity
with
sweetness
firm
toastiness
great
interplay
of
all
the
traits
and
with
good
complexity
it
has
spiceypeppery
and
raisiny
bitterness
finish
has
burnt
raisins
and
spicey
bite
it
is
wonderful
balanced
complex
and
not
overly
sweet
feel
is
a
bit
frothy
very
firm
a
solid
bock
from
einbecker
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
flavor
and
substance
to
drink
for
a
while
pours
light
brown
with
thin
white
head
nose
is
very
light
and
weak
with
a
little
brown
bread
toastyness
palate
is
malty
sweet
but
somewhat
thin
bodied
and
thin
in
flavors
and
the
alcohol
makes
an
appearance
even
when
cold
drinkability
is
still
there
since
this
is
a
very
light
thirst
quenching
bock
altogether
a
good
beer
just
a
little
to
herbal
in
the
flavor
for
my
taste
drinkability
takes
a
slight
knock
just
for
the
fact
its
so
sweet
almost
annoyingly
so
d
not
bad
but
this
has
to
be
better
at
the
source
will
try
again
in
hopes
of
a
fresher
bottle
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
bock
but
the
appearance
is
a
little
off
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
special
very
light
but
a
little
too
skunky
to
be
too
drinkable
maybe
just
because
its
an
import
again
i
am
unimpressed
with
this
brewery
all
their
beers
smell
the
same
and
the
taste
only
differs
slightly
theyre
not
bad
really
but
there
are
certainly
some
better
examples
of
the
styles
available
especially
considering
the
expensive
price
d
a
very
balanced
and
drinkable
beer
having
never
had
a
bock
before
i
am
not
sure
how
true
to
style
it
is
but
it
would
pair
great
with
a
peice
of
rustic
bread
smeared
with
warm
honey
or
perhaps
something
spicy
a
pint
would
be
the
proper
serving
size
it
does
not
wear
me
out
the
hot
alcohol
is
surprising
but
would
be
welcome
on
a
cold
night
even
on
a
warm
spring
afternoon
it
wasnt
unpleasent
d
good
bottle
that
houses
a
pretty
darn
solid
bock
beer
try
it
if
you
get
the
chance
this
one
hit
me
very
well
i
bought
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
a
green
bottle
i
hate
when
i
get
jipped
that
8
of
an
ounce
it
forms
a
very
nice
and
thick
foamy
offwhite
head
when
poured
into
my
pint
glass
sticks
to
the
glass
as
it
empties
it
has
a
sort
of
sweet
bready
malty
aroma
has
some
bitterness
and
a
sour
element
in
the
flavor
yet
semisweet
and
malty
as
well
nice
texture
and
carbonation
and
not
too
heavy
theres
a
sourlike
and
somewhat
unpleasant
aftertaste
its
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
bocks
out
there
d
pretty
straight
forward
not
very
complex
goes
down
nicely
though
a
great
example
of
the
old
original
style
from
the
old
original
brewery
it
was
ok
not
overly
impressed
not
worth
the
extra
money
of
buying
this
import
overall
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
beer
i
dont
know
how
often
ill
seek
it
out
but
i
will
certainly
enjoy
it
if
its
available
this
is
a
very
drinkable
bock

great

d
good
stuff
definitely
one
of
the
best
of
a
style
that
i
normally
find
boring
and
mundane
this
is
top
notch
beer
bottle
at
winking
lizard
this
beer
is
a
clear
reddishbrown
color
with
a
medium
light
beige
head
that
dissipates
steadily
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
mildly
sweet
malt
and
caramel
with
a
touch
of
hops
light
smooth
body
with
a
sweet
malty
character
notes
of
bread
and
hops
are
present
in
the
taste
the
finish
is
moderately
sweet
with
a
toasted
malt
aftertaste
average
and
fairly
onedimensional
overall
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
with
little
to
no
lacing
carmelized
malt
earthy
and
grainy
aromas
biscuity

malt
up

very
sweet
with
a
lemon
hop
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
mouth
coating
beer
with
a
lingering
sweetness
clean
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
worth
a
try
a
very
nice
brew
with
good
drinkability
if
it
was
less
expensive
id
be
all
over
it
this
beer
poured
an
attractive
copper
color
which
surprised
me
as
i
anticipated
a
darker
beer
it
had
a
decent
lasting
head
and
left
some
lacing
aroma
was
of
sweet
roasted
malt
dark
fruits
and
honey
flavor
was
similar
but
i
found
it
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
still
a
good
beer
but
the
sweetness
would
keep
me
from
having
more
than
1
or
2
mouthfeel
was
good

d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
but
might
be
a
little
too
hoppy
for
some
smooth
with
good
flavor
nice
bock
one
of
the
better
and
more
complex
bocks
i
have
tried
d
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
well
worthy
of
a
try
this
one
seems
to
be
on
the
lighter
side
of
a
bock
almost
like
a
dark
marzen
had
a
bottle
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
beer
had
a
tan
colored
brown
appearance
with
some
creamy
lacing
aromas
were
really
appetizing
a
generally
milky
and
roasty
aroma
this
was
a
very
sweet
bock
with
a
great
balance
of
milky
cream
flavoring
with
yeasty
malt
aspects
not
to
repeat
myself
but
yes
this
was
a
wonderfully
creamy
drink
but
what
was
nice
was
it
was
light
overall
a
great
bock
d
good
would
purchase
again
but
missed
on
account
of
close
taste
to
a
marzen
and
color
i
had
severals
glasses
of
this
beer
during
the
festival
as
it
was
one
of
my
favorites
just
an
absolute
joy
to
drink
and
a
reminder
that
not
everything
has
to
have
a
ton
of
hops
to
be
delicious
an
excellent
beer
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
bock
although
its
a
dunkel
its
not
too
dark
the
taste
is
quite
full
bodied
a
bit
syrupy
and
loaded
with
caramel
malts
and
some
toasted
grains
there
is
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
the
beer
and
a
bit
of
an
alcoholy
throatiness
in
the
finish
that
im
not
as
pleased
with
the
caramel
malts
pretty
much
dominate
along
with
the
butterscotch
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
thats
what
im
getting
from
this
beer
there
may
be
a
bit
of
nuttiness
towards
the
finish
maybe
a
slight
bit
of
peatiness
too
the
alcohol
in
the
finish
and
beyond
is
just
a
bit
much
for
a
6
5
abv
bock
try
this
tasty
classic
with
a
hearty
meal
decent
thick
mouthfeel
is
a
plus
but
overall
this
is
just
too
sweet
to
be
very
drinkable
d
enjoyable
enough
but
a
bit
harsh
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
not
especially
smooth
or
easy
to
drink
d
an
enjoyable
beer
maybe
not
extraordinarily
special
for
a
bock
but
it
is
the
original
and
it
is
very
worthwhile
12oz
green
bottle
from

a
dark
amber

body
with
virtually
no
head
smells
mostly
of
caramel
malts
and
herbal
spicy
hops
tastes
very
sweet
with
caramel
malts
dominating
with
a
fair
bit
of
herbal
continental
hops
flavors
are
fairly
subtle
but
apparent
and
very
wellbalanced
finishes
rather
clean
on
the
lighter
side
of

with
moderate
carbonation

and
extremely
drinkable
definitely
picking
this
one
up
again

some

there
was
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
slight

skunking
very
drinkable
overall
this
was
a
great
bock
beer
that
can
be
complimented
with
dessert
or
enjoyed
alone
if
only
this
was
a
double
bock
then
i
would
definitely
give
it
an
a
will
buy
ur
bock
dunkel
again
d
an
average
drink
not
bad
but
nothing
that
would
make
you
seek
it
out
or
recommend
not
bad
worth
a
shot
has
a
pronounced
carbonated
mouthfeel
but
it
was
not
objectionable
smooth
overall
this
was
not
hard
to
drink
on
a
colder
winter
night
i
may
try
this
again
it
was
good
enough
to
warrant
a
second
tasting
imo
d
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
an
excellent
bock
definitely
underrated
overall
a
very
solid
beer
and
ill
buy
drink
this
again
if
im
able
to
find
some
again

clouded
amber
with

ruby
tint
and
a

nose
is

and
malty
with
a
slight
sweet
edge
flavor
is
sweet
and
tangy
with
an
almost
roasted
old
fruit
quality
to
it
feel
is
thick
and
almost
syrup
like
on
the
tongue
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
might
be
too
sweet
or
pungent
for
some
but
for
me
it
is
just
fine
i
just
wish
einbecker
would
ditch
the
green
bottles
i
think
i
like
this
one
more
than
the
maiurbock
its
a
little
cleaner
on
the
palate
and
not
as
biting
with
dunkel
in
the
name
it
could
probably
stand
to
be
a
little
bit
darker
seems
like
it
could
make
for
a
nice
session
brew
this
beer
has
a
redamber
color
the
clarity
is
clear
it
has
a
malty
aroma
with
a
lingering
caramel
scent
the
flavor
is
malty
with
caramel
notes
and
a
light
smoke
finish
it
has
a
body
that
is
between
medium
and
full
the
head
was
moderate
but
dissipated
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
sweet
but
not
cloy
beer
drinkability
very
smooth
and
drinkable
could
have
downed
a
few
more
pretty
easily
overall
a
solid
bock
beer
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
bit
more
bitterness
than
expected
a
welcome
surprise
i
am
suddenly
reminded
how
much
i
enjoy
a
good
bock
try
it
if
you
have
the
opportunity
drinkability
is
rather
good
for
the
style
without
overpowering
any
one
of
the
flavor
departments
but
creating
a
good
mix
that
finishes
smoothly
highly
recommended
im
a
huge
doppelbock
fan
but
ive
had
markedly
less
experience
with
the
original
bock
style
this
poured
a
ruby
shade
of
brown
that
was
a
little
lighter
than
a
doppel
bock
the
initial
taste
was
malty
but
finished
with
a
hint
of
hops
there
was
also
a
slight
trace
of
metal
floating
in
the
background
i
may
have
grabbed
a
bottle
that
was
past
its
prime
overall
the
flavor
was
decent
but
a
bit
weak
the
malty
flavor
was
a
little
weak
the
hops
flavor
a
little
limp
ill
try
this
again
but
its
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
robust
bock
actually
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
another
bottle
a
tasty
clean
and
fun
beer
to
drink
ill
buy
again
a
fine
beer
among
the
better
bocks
that
youll
find
this
is
a
tough
style
since
its
not
over
the
top
in
many
any
way
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
as
a
stoutporter
drinker
this
time
of
year
this
brew
is
rich
tasty
smooth
and
satisfying
it
would
go
well
with
beef
stew
or
other
winter
meals
drinks
allright
but
just
a
soso
bock
good
to
try
for
a
tip
of
the
hat
to
the
home
of
bockbier
supposedly
this
brewerys
product
never
impressed
me
in
germany
either
had
this
wonderful
dunkel
at
hop
devil
in
nyc
a
few
months
ago
tonight
it
pours
from
a
11
2
oz
bottle
ill
never
understand
why
such
a
small
bottle
my
22
oz
tucher
weizen
glass
is
perfect
for
observation
of
the
carmel
color
and
high
clarity
its
a
bubbly
spirited
carbonation
but
not
overly
so
no
evidence
of
yeast
which
i
suppose
makes
sense
aroma
is
so
light
corn
comes
through
with
whispers
of
carmel
nothing
outstanding
in
that
regard
the
head
is
typically
thin
and
lace
hugs
the
glass
but
survives
but
for
a
brief
few
moments
before
disappearing
into
the
glass
the
taste
is
another
story
raisens
dried
apricots
prevail
a
hearty
mouthfeel
that
screams
dunkel
a
highly
drinkable
beer
which
if
partying
is
your
state
of
mind
will
be
most
enjoyable
given
its
6
5
abv

pours
light
brown

medium

very
sweet
flavor
medium

with
a
sweet
honeylike
finish
smells
nutty
with
some
nice
doughy
elements
and
metallic
soapy
splashes
however
the
toffee
and
sweet
malts
stand
out
in
the
smell
pretty
good
beer
to
quaff
down

2
ounce

taste
was
dominated
by
the
hops
resinous
and
weedy
a
slight
caramel
touch
and
sweet
the
bitterness
activates
my
mucus
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
after
13
of
the
glass
i
get
some
alcoholic
whiffs
that
make
the
beer
taste
heavier
than
it
really
is
a
pretty
clean
yeast
has
been
used
the
beer
has
little
yeast
character
bottom
fermented
probably
bold
bock
the
beer
was
very
dark
in
color
and
tasted
very
well
i
drank
the
beer
warm
and
i
think
it
was
a
good
beer
i
would
try
this
beer
again
if
it
was
presented
to
me
it
had
a
very
nice
sweet
taste
for
a
german
dunkel
which
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
pours
a
medium
orangebrown

i
like
this
one
pretty
well
not
the
best
of
the
bocks
but
good
none
the
less
worth

especially
if
youre
into

is
a
summer
fruit
and
malt
taste
is
malty
and
fruity
but
a
too
strong
bitterness
shows
itself
at
the
ending
a
very
poorly
balanced
beer
with
the
strong
bitterness
not
being
very
pleasant
this
is
probably
my
first
simple
bock
pours
an
amber
color
with
nice
clarity
and
a
beautiful
beige
head
that
retains
well
the
aroma
is
striking
and
seemingly
authentic
with

toasted

and
some
slight
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
also
intensely
malty
with
notes
of
toasted

molasses
herbs
mineraly
hops

alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
and
drinkability
is
limited
by
alcohol
and
the
mineraly
bitterness
a
descent
bock
but
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
limit
the
enjoyability
of
this
beer
prost
mk
overall
it
was
drinkable
not
as
tasty
as
their
maibock
but
respectable
drinkability
although
the
bitterness
has
some
disagreeable
medicinal
qualities
this
is
a
pretty
good
bock
poured
a
a
two
finger
head
with
some
decent
retention
some
faint
lacing
was
able
to
penetrate
that
deep
caramel
copper
haze
when
held
to
the
light
the
smell
was
pilsnery
crystal
malts
very
prevalent
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
taste
but
mixed
with
the
malts
was
a
little
earthy
fruit
aroma
the
flavor
starts
with
some
lightly
sweetened
malts
mixing
with
some
spicy
fruits
the
finish
is
all
crystal
malt
palate
was
a
little
dry
but
not
bad
a
good
bock
but
i
was
glad
i
found
a
single
bottle
on
sale
instead
of
a
sixer
for
me
its
a
bit
too
sweet
but
i
have
to
say
its
pretty
smooth
and
seems
well
brewed
what
it
lacks
in
balance
it
makes
up
for
later
how
malts
are
outstanding
whether
a
beer
is
balanced
or
not
doesnt
matter
to
me
as
long
as
the
dominant
theme
is
tasty
and
well
put
together
recomended
a
great
bock
poured
out
to
a
medium
orange
color
with
a
vigorus
level
of
carbonation
that
produced
and
nice
1
inch
head
of
foam
minor
notes
of
lacing
aromas
of
herbs
and
malts
are
strong
as
are
noteable
elements
of
caramel
and
hay
taste
is
very
good
flavors
of
malt
grain
molassas
and
dry
herbs
mingle
across
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
and
very
easily
drank
this
is
a
winner
recommended
drinking
when
it
comes
to
german
beers
i
dug
it
but
this
isnt
a
beer
for
everybody
the
taste
is
spicy
malt
flavor
with
some
medium
dryness
and
mild
alcohol
their
is
a
nice
hop
bitterness
balanced
in
with
the
malt
in
the
aftertaste
that
leads
into
an
alcohol
warmth
not
average
but
not
great
worth
a
try
at
least
it
wasnt
skunked
thanks
to
its
green
bottle
tastes
dirty
opinion
considering
that
this
beer
is
here
in
the
us
is
a
good
thing
but
the
time
and
environment
are
not
kind
to
a
beer
that
is
a
bit
delicate
like
this
one
a
doppelbock
is
more
forgiving
but
a
traditional
bockhelles
bockpilsnerkoelschalt
etc
should
really
be
tried
in
germany
to
experience
what
it
is
really
supposed
to
taste
like
we
get
to
the
point
to
where
we
expect
the
oxidation
notes
from
a
homebrew
example
in
a
contest
but
this
is
actually
not
to
style
the
homebrew
is
closer
to
the
real
thing
as
you
would
find
in
the
country
of
origin
but
all
of
the
commercial
examples
we
try
skew
our
opinions
an
above
average
bock
but
nothing
special
the
flavors
are
indicative
of
the
style
but
nothing
beyond
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
but
it
definitely
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
impression
a
fine
urbock
not
a
sipper
but
not
a
guzzler
satisfying
but
not
terribly
refreshing
or
heavy
bitter
aftertaste
long
hop
and
light
liquorice
good
balance
the
color
is
dark
copper
with
a
slight
tint
of
redness
head
is
nicesized
and
offwhite
the
aroma
is
of
lightly
fragrant
dark
caramel
malts
not
too
complex
the
taste
begins
with
a
strong
rounded
caramel
malt
presence
which
becomes
more
moderate
towards
the
middle
of
the
sip
hops
provide
a
gentle
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
herbal
flavors
herbal
flavors
become
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
finish
is
the
sweetest
part
of
a
sip
its
almost
sugary
very
good
stuff
here
i
like

ive
tried

eggshell
colored
froth
shot
down
quickly
leaving
only
a
dusting
and
tons
of
lacing
no
aroma
really
just
some
maltiness
floating
up
just
very
clean
great
feel
smooth
and
silky
the
carbonation
is
barely
noticeable
but
there
it
just
glides
around
your
mouth
medium
bodied
roasted
malt
and
caramelly
sweetness
nice
dark
toastyness
leaves
a
lot
of
flavor
on
your
tongue
good
flavor
and
feel
very
drinkable

and
poors
in
without

much
head
witch
is

though
an

is
seet
malty
paperycartboard
and
old
vegetables
so
from
fresh
some
esters
and
a
caramelmalt
hide
the
off
taste
so
all
together
avarage
taste
is
strong
sweet
oxidised
and
then
going
into
a
moderate
bitterness
had
the
feeling
that
i
sampled
a
mondaymorning
offbrew
cause
cant
recal
it
always
was
this
uninteresting
and
dull
330
ml
green
bottle
with
no
notch
on
the
part
of
the
label
that
indicates
freshness
this
is
my
first
bock
beer
if
you
discount
amber
bock
i
could
tell
i
was
going
to
like
this
beer
just
from
the
scent
released
when
opening
pours
a
copperred
with
an
offwhite
1
finger
head
that
never
goes
completely
away
but
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
smells
are
predominantly
sweet
consisting
of
caramel
molasses
grapes
and
other
dark
fruits
along
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
more
flavor
than
expected
lots
of
malts
make
it
rich
and
chewy
contributing
more
fruit
along
with
a
bit
of
coffee
and
toasted
flavors
the
hops
are
crisp
but
they
are
more
apparent
in
the
bitterness
they
leave
the
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
warming
sensation
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
for
a
lager
only
becoming
smoother
as
it
warms
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
nice
field
grass
aroma
and
harvested
grains
hoppy
and
sweet
ooh
it
gives
me
a
hopbitter
zinger
thats
surprising
goodness
theres
some
yummygummy
tutifruti
the
alcohol
sucks
in
my
cheeks
i
like
that
mouthfeel
pretty
awesome
with
a
little
numbness
fuzzy
i
liked
the
schwarzbier
better
this
is
a
mouthfull
though
bitter
and
pinewood
smoke
full
mouth
sweetness
alcohol
dryness
very
nice
bring
on
a
phat
stein
and
a
plate
of
bierrocks
with
dark
horseradish
mustard
the
beer
seemed
to
miss
on
its
predrink
character
but
the
taste
more
than
made
up
for
that
all
and
all
a
beer
that
id
like
to
have
again
nice
clear
amber
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
stale
bread
and
chocolate
aromas
sweet
toast
caramel
and
nutty
flavors
medium
to
full
body
with
a
full
and
soft
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
lingering
sweetness
gets
a
little
better
as
it
warms
not
bad
received
in
the
beer
of
the
month
club
and
was
excited
most
of
all
to
try
this
one
out
the
newsletter
suggested
to
try
with
pasta
and
tomato
sauce
i
enjoyed
the
combination
fullyalso
a
nice
balance
of
caramel
and
chocolate
appeared
with
a
nice
head
and
lacing
surprised
to
see
this
shipped
to
north
carolina
although
our
pop
the
cap
laws
havent
passed
yet
pours
a
transparent
copper
with
medium
white
head
which
leaves
a
layer
of
foam
and
somewhat
clingy
lacing
sweet
soapy
caramel
and
roasted
malt
aroma
not
particularly
appetizing
for
me
due
to
the
overwhelming
sweet
soapiness
sweet
caramel
initial
flavor
which
builds
into
coarse
cereals
toasted
malts
and
finishes
with
slightly
drying
hops
and
somewhat
metallic
aftertaste
chewy
and
creamy
body
with
strong
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
good
handfull
of
these
but
they
might
get
a
little
cloying
after
a
few
this
poured
a
light
caramel
color
nice
fairly
thick
head
that
retained
well
throughout
smell
was
of
molasses
and
raisins
taste
follows
nice
hop
balance
but
a
tilt
toward
the
malts
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
full
creamy
and
a
bit
chewy
on
the
end
fairly
good
carbonation
as
well
drinkability
is
very
good
very
nice
beer
and
a
bit
different
than
others
ive
had
in
this
vain
recommended
some
caramel
malts
in
the
nose
taste
is
nothing
special
not
as
malty
sweet
as
my
favorite
dopplebocks
in
fact
there
isnt
much
sweetness
just
a
little
in
the
beginning
which
quickly
gives
way
to
bitterness
theres
actually
more
bitterness
than
i
would
expect
from
a
bock
though
this
is
my
1st
single
bock
im
not
good
at
identifying
hops
but
i
think
they
are
a
little
grassy
in
here
and
i
dont
mean
that
in
a
good
way
finish
is
on
the
dry
side
and
the
bitterness
lingers
for
a
bit
definitely
not
a
maltbomb
overall
very
average
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
fancy
package
would
indicate
if
you
like
bocks
try
a
single
1st
and
see
if
you
like
this
i
wish
i
had
drinkability

this
was
a
fun
drinker
but
it
felt
way
overthetop
and
out
of
character
for
the
style
the
appearance
is
clear
and
mahogany
with
a
massive
steady
head
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
which
i
personally
enjoy
although
i
suspect
this
might
be
fairly
old
nonetheless
some
caramel
maltiness
is
in
there
and
is
enough
to
satisfy
any
malt
lover
taste
is
clean
yet
malty
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
along
with
a
toasted
sesame
flavor
slightly
sweet
to
compliment
the
roasted
notes
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
helps
balance
this
out
a
bit
drinkability
if
off
the
charts
i
could
pound
this
all
night
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
excellent
this
urbock
dunkel
is
copper
colored
and
a
tad
hazy
the
head
didnt
stick
around
as
long
as
id
expected
although
when
it
was
there
it
was
fairly
pleasant
an
offwhite
little
cap
of
snow
over
a
deep
copper
base
the
aroma
has
a
hints
of
bready
biscuity
malt
with
a
little
toastiness
to
boot
and
also
a
touch
of
skunkiness
generally
if
i
get
a
bad
bottle
i
assume
its
a
fluke
but
i
dont
consider
skunkiness
to
be
a
fluke
if
the
brew
is
in
green
bottle
which
this
one
is
a
pet
peeve
the
flavor
is
possibly
the
saving
grace
with
an
initial
caramel
sweetness
followed
by
a
robust
hearty
cereal
and
grainy
maltiness
that
dissolves
into
a
little
hoppy
flavor
and
a
full
balancing
hoppy
bitterness
however
the
beer
feels
a
little
less
fullbodied
than
id
expect
for
the
style
finally
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
id
have
more
although
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
bocks
and
i
expect
there
are
others
that
are
better
ill
keep
searching
though
so
for
now
i
give
it
a
good
drinkability
pours
with
a
threefinger
white
head
that
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
clear
deep
amber
color
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
strong
malty
nose
starts
sweet
finishes
with
a
slight
hoppy
bite
a
good
bock
even
with
the
green
bottle
2
10
for
a
330ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
this
bock
poured
deep
amber
less
golden
than
i
usually
expect
a
bock
to
come
out
of
the
bottle
it
had
a
light
inch
head
with
just
a
trace
of
a
lace
as
i
sipped
the
beer
a
stream
of
champagne
bubbles
continuously
tries
to
renew
the
head
as
it
sits
here
in
front
of
me
it
smelled
very
malty
with
deep
candy
overtones
the
smell
has
a
character
of
a
dopplebock
not
as
much
hop
on
the
nose
a
sipahh
caramel
up
front
and
finally
the
hops
assert
themselves
mid
drink
and
the
finish
is
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
a
good
execution
of
the
bock
style
it
has
a
medium
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
many
bocks
can
overload
the
alcohol
and
make
them
to
much
to
drink
as
a
session
beer
this
has
a
nice
malty
goodness
that
eases
the
alcohol
punch
i
generally
prefer
a
more
malty
sweetness
in
bock
beers
than
this
this
is
a
solid
bock
beer
really
wunderbar
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
light
effervescence
all
over
the
tongue
a
decently
drinkable
beer
it
would
be
so
much
more
so
if
the
alcohol
presence
only
6
5
were
more
subdued
as
it
warmed
it
became
somewhat
more
prevalent
i
like
this
better
than
my
numbers
reflect
but
it
needs
a
little
more
of
everything
to
be
truly
noteworthy
the
beer
after
its
departure
from
the
green
11
2
ounce
bottle
sets
in
my
einbecker
bock
glass
a
burnished
copper
color
with
a
large
tan
head
which
is
semicreamy
in
texture
the
lace
forms
a
thick
curtain
to
drape
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
malt
caramel
and
fresh
crisp
clean
you
get
the
picture
and
or
scent
dont
you
start
is
quite
sweet
nice
malt
profile
top
is
moderate
in
feel
with
the
finish
benign
in
its
acidity
the
hops
a
plentiful
and
spicy
quite
dry
and
lingering
aftertaste
a
drinkable
brew
tis
true
strongly
bitter
at
first
with
hops
dominating
the
flavor
malts
sneak
into
the
picture
midsip
only
to
be
replaced
again
by
a
bitter
finish
that
is
unappealing
this
is
a
nice
wellmade
bock
beer
the
green
bottles
thankfully
had
no
bearing
on
the
aroma
or
flavor
of
the
brew
i
would
say
that
there
are
similarities
to
a
doppelbock
this
brew
is
lighter
in
body
and
flavor
it
isnt
exceptional
but
this
one
ranks
as
pretty
good
in
my
book
i
saw
this
one
in
the
liquor
store
and
figured
id
give
it
a
try
i
kind
of
thought
it
would
be
a
lot
better
than
it
was
although
i
will
say
this
its
a
pretty
interesting
beer
i
expected
this
to
be
darker
than
it
was
it
poured
a
dark
reddish
almost
brown
color
the
smell
was
very
coffeeish
i
thought
that
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
combination
of
chocolate
and
coffee
but
there
was
something
else
in
there
that
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
nice
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
this
beer
is
good
but
not
as
good
as
i
had
anticipated
it
came
in
6
pack
with
small
roundish
bottles
with
goldish
paper
and
i
really
thought
this
one
would
be
world
class
worth
a
try
though
if
you
find
it
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
its
unlike
any
bock
ive
ever
had
and
the
euroskunk
element
that
is
here
and
there
is
not
something
i
care
for
i
suppose
overall
it
has
substantial
complexities
that
make
it
worth
trying
again
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
substantial
malt
character
that
would
have
more
successfully
dominated
the
euroskunk
hops
the
flavor
profile
leads
with
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
ends
with
a
dry
hop
finish
hops
are
prominent
in
the
profile
at
all
points
the
beer
carries
its
alcohol
very
well
a
very
nice
big
meal
beer
and
a
great
winter
warmer
session
beer
dont
be
turned
off
by
the
sulfur
nose
let
it
offgas
for
a
minute
or
two
and
forgive
it
clear
in
body
color
is
a
light
amber
with
a
slight
copperish
tone
a
quick
puffy
offwhite
head
appears
swiftly
and
crumbles
away
nearly
just
as
fast
leaving
a
thin
collar
always
present
and
very
minimal
spots
of
lace
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
of
malts
with
a
burntlike
toffee
notes
of
wet
old
grass
crisp
and
light
on
the
nose
overall
taste
is
has
a
quick
little
start
thats
thinnishly
silky
where
then
just
past
midway
some
slightly
twinged
grassy
and
earth
toned
hops
and
burntish
malts
begin
to
mingle
for
a
bit
then
the
hops
fade
off
leaving
some
burntish
toffee
across
the
palate
as
it
finishes
with
a
soft
dryness
and
subdued
crispness
feel
has
a
bit
of
texture
in
the
carbonation
leaving
behind
some
twingy
burnt
malt
burps
with
a
passable
medium
fullness
throughout
its
a
bit
slow
moving
at
first
but
kinda
grows
on
ya
as
you
go
this
seems
to
be
something
that
would
go
well
around
a
bonfire
to
me
why
i
couldnt
say
it
just
does
something
simple
yet
with
a
bit
of
interest
and
a
nice
warming
of
6
5
would
make
it
a
good
fire
side
drink
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
alive
and
alcohol
back
end
is
warming
and
pleasing
earthy
and
grassy
notes
make
drinakability
a
little
lower
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
clear
amber
hue
coppery
highlights
it
is
a
very
lovely
color
the
offwhite
head
reached
a
half
finger
in
size
and
it
quickly
faded
to
a
soapy
residue
no
lace
was
produced
the
nose
is
unimpressive
sweet
maltiness
strong
influences
of
grassiness
sulfur
oddly
eurolager
in
nature
frankly
the
bouquet
repulses
me
the
palate
is
malty
sweet
hints
of
caramel
grassy
in
the
middle
which
i
didnt
care
for
the
finish
is
pleasantly
hoppybitter
a
saving
grace
imo
im
not
trilled
by
the
huskiness
or
the
slight
nuttiness
in
the
taste
the
aftertaste
is
long
with
tacky
sweetness
and
faint
hops
bitterness
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
it
is
dissimilar
to
any
bock
ive
had
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
on
the
palate
a
nice
accomplishment
but
it
does
warm
the
belly
medium
in
body
a
touch
light
the
carbonation
is
very
modest
and
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
slick
more
malt
would
work
nicely
oh
well
i
paid
3
00
for
a
11
2
ounce
green
bottle
in
omaha
honestly
this
would
not
be
worth
drinking
if
it
was
free
the
nose
ruins
any
favorable
impression
of
this
beer
i
do
like
the
hoppiness
of
the
palate
but
little
else
not
my
cup
of
bock
maybe
it
will
work
for
you
but
i
cant
recommend
it
poured
in
a
nice
einbecker
dunkel
glass
dark
coffee
bean
color
with
a
good
head
lacing
present
throughout
the
glass
not
much
nose
to
speak
of
but
the
falvors
were
deep
dark
and
full
bodied
sweet
rich
icey
cool
malt
flavors
with
little
hop
flavors
mild
hop
flavors
on
the
back
end
but
clearly
malts
rule
this
beer
there
was
good
body
to
this
beer
as
it
crossed
the
tounge
and
coated
my
mouth
with
flavors
of
plums
figs
and
tobacco
the
nose
opened
up
a
little
as
the
galss
warmed
but
always
it
was
the
rich
sweet
malts
that
dominated
a
nice
representation
of
the
bock
style
worth
trying
one
is
enough
for
me
but
others
might
like
the
flavors
a
little
more
than
me
light
cream
colored
head
was
foamy
in
apperance
and
left
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
beer
is
dark
amber
in
color
and
fairly
clear
sweet
malty
aroma
theres
not
much
going
on
with
the
flavors
a
very
mild
sweet
alcoholic
maltiness
is
followed
up
by
a
bitter
metalic
aftertaste
the
flavor
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
suggests
but
then
again
there
really
isnt
that
much
to
the
flavor
this
urbock
poured
a
clear
coppery
red
color
with
good
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
a
sweet
floral
and
vinous
aroma
with
a
touch
of
biscuit
interesting
the
taste
was
mildly
sweet
and
floral
almost
flowery
there
was
a
vinous
flavor
dark
grape
skins
as
well
as
malt
oak
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
hops
came
out
in
the
finish
there
was
a
slightly
detectable
alcohol
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
fruity
with
medium
body
and
carbonation
it
was
somewhat
warming
with
a
dry
finish
this
was
a
nice
and
very
interesting
beer
unlike
any
other
bock
i
have
every
tasted
this
pours
clear
golden
brown
it
has
a
light
body
along
with
a
lousy
flavor
the
alcohol
is
far
too
apparent
this
is
a
loser
save
your
money
please
avoid
this
beer
this
brew
pours
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
light
brown
bubbles
that
lasted
a
fair
amout
of
time
and
a
semiopaque
brown
body
it
has
a
nice
mild
malty
aroma
its
flavor
is
a
bit
fizzy
for
a
dunkel
and
mild
with
hints
of
malt
and
lacking
any
real
distinctive
flavor
this
brew
pours
the
color
of
a
tarnished
penny
with
a
slight
layer
of
filmlike
head
very
muddy
thick
wet
malt
aroma
with
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
nondescript
as
far
as
many
beers
are
concerned
but
fairly
potent
i
think
as
a
lot
of
bocks
go
mediumbodied
and
offers
the
mouth
a
slight
tingly
feeling
light
acidic
like
the
lemon
filling
in
a
pastry
pushes
into
a
malty
flavor
dominated
by
a
sloppy
wet
mouthfeel
pumpernickel
and
light
caramel
notes
pretty
drinkable
for
a
beefy
brew
solid
dunkel
bock
with
a
mahogany
color
and
roasted
qualities
alcohol
is
prevalent
at
the
final
sip
of
the
glass
as
the
head
is
creamy
and
the
mouthfeel
velvety
this
dunkel
is
wel
known
and
well
made
a
bit
skunky
at
first
must
be
those
green
bottle
but
it
does
subside
after
a
few
minutes

quickly
disappeared
pours
a
deep
copper
with
not
much
head
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
heavy
malt
aroma
taste
of
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
caramel
low
carbonation
and
a
stickysweet
mouthfeel
almost
like
a
barleywine
a
good
kick
back
and
relax
sipping
beer
pours
out
a
deep
copper
colour
with
a
foamy
head
the
dies
down
to
a
sticky
thin
layer
of
lace
a
rather
nondescript
aroma
of
sweet
malts
a
pretty
sweet
and
stiff
malt
profile
doesnt
give
up
a
lot
in
the
flavour
department
typical
bock
hardiness
with
soft
german
malt
and
hop
notes
as
it
warms
a
bit
the
malt
profile
comes
through
a
bit
with
dunkel
notes
of
toastiness
hints
of
cocoa
and
caramel
complimented
by
ghostly
dark
fruits
definite
hoppiness
for
a
bock
and
an
alcohol
kick
to
round
things
out
at
first
i
thought
this
a
rather
boring
brew
but
as
it
warmed
the
complexity
shines
through
it
finishes
rather
dry
maybe
showing
its
age
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
lets
all
this
german
goodness
go
down
quite
easily
this
bottle
was
a
little
old
explaining
the
relaxed
flavour
profile
dryness
and
smoothness
and
drinkability
a
rather
nice
german
bock
note
this
comes
in
a
dark
green
bottle
and
there
was
the
slightest
hint
of
skunk
on
the
open
none
in
the
pour
translucent
copper
with
a
frothy
white
head
settles
to
about
14
inch
sweet
carmel
malt
aroma
with
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
flavor
was
very
much
on
the
sweet
side
with
carmel
being
the
dominant
flavor
almost
cloying
with
only
slightly
herbal
notes
offer
a
little
balance
syrupy
and
thick
with
medium
carbonation
the
sweetness
and
thickness
lower
the
drinkability
better
than
the
urbock
hell
low
head
pleasant
malty
toffee
aroma
slightly
nutty
flavour
strong
alcohol
presence
fairly
well
balanced
with
the
malts
and
hops
a
decent
bock
but
not
as
good
as
the
norwegian
ones
esp
aass
quite
a
herbal
nose
mixed
in
with
a
bit
of
a
dark
malt
character
bit
of
chocolate
bit
of
roastiness
quite
a
sticky
malt
start
syruppy
texure
and
a
bitter
herbal
flavour
not
as
good
as
the
urbock
hell
i
think
i
think
the
paler
malts
worked
better
pours
with
a
beautiful
just
offwhite
rocky
head
topping
light
brownamber
liquid
nose
is
of
sweet
malt
natch
very
appetizing
too
i
might
add
taste
is
superb
lightly
sweet
malt
followed
by
an
almost
dominating
hop
bitterness
hops
win
out
in
the
finish
with
the
maltiness
of
the
grain
creating
an
interesting
interplay
on
the
palate
this
is
one
of
the
classics
here
boys
the
notsoheaviness
makes
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
plenty
of
the
original
bockbier
try
it
if
you
see
it
well
worth
the
8
i
paid
for
a
sixer

hint
of
peppery

body
is
medium
and
tangy
taste
is

and
peppery

finish
is
long

spicy
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
bottle
o
a
middle
of
the
road
bock
with
muted
flavors
that
might
be
due
to
this
being
a
little
old
the
balance
between
the
bitterness
and
the
malt
sweetness
is
nice
i
cant
believe
how
many
years
theyve
been
making
this
swill
and
to
give
lakefront
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
they
still
cant
get
the
quality
control
figured
out
label
says
bottled
in

they
dont

thanks
guys
overall
nothing
super
special
about
this
beer
at
least
nothing
new
or
thoughtprovoking
that
i
can
tell
but
it
is
a
very
goodtasting
beer
overall
this
beer
poured
a
reddishbrown
with
no
to
very
little
head
i
felt
the
taste
at
the
beginning
was
crisp
to
slightly
sweet
as
the
beer
warmed
slightly
crispness
faded
the
smell
was
honeylike
this
beer
had
a
full
flavor
robust
yet
refreshing
seemed
lighter
than
other
bocks
i
have
had
i
could
not
taste
or
feel
the
alcohol
warmth
although
the
abv
is
6
7
percent
overall
a
beer
that
is
on
the
upper
end
of
good
and
one
that
enjoyed
and
will
try
again
o
nice
beer
quite
good
for
the
style
worth
visiting
again
when
i
get
a
chance

this

has
a
good
level

a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
that
really
grabs
my
attention
and
would
make
me
want
another
o
for
the
maltlovers
out
there
this
bock
is
another
easy
drinking
very
well
made
lager
from
lakefront
that
features
loads
of
toast
and
caramel
sweet
malts
with
just
enough
balance
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
smooth
and
drinkable

a
faint
warming
sensation
of
alcohol

those
cooler

it
is
difficult
to
find
something
to
criticize
but
i
do
feel
that
it
suffers
somewhat
from
a
lack
of
toasted

than
that
it
is
a
somewhat
better
than

bock

is

for

win

malty
with
a
good

this
a
decent
finish
to
an
other
wise
stuttermisstep
at
the
start
you
eventually
warm
up
to
this
not
a
bad
bock
but
has
enough
flaws
that
this
would
only
be
an
option
if
fairly
hard
up
for
a
bock
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
purchase
more
its
just
not
a
reference
bock
but
a
drinkers
bock
overall
very
good
brew
and
true
to
bock
style
overall
a
decent
bock
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
among
the
ones
ive
tried
this
season
however
im
perfectly
happy
to
drink
up
the
rest
of
the
6pack
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
film
with
no
lacing
a
malty
aroma
with
a
vanilla
scent
behind
it
very
malty
flavor
with
a
slight
caramel
finish
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
bock
d
a
solid
bock
that
tastes
good
and
doesnt
try
to
be
overly
or
ridiculously
sweet
which
i
appreciate
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
no
problem
a
very
drinkable
bock
with
a
nice
sweet
malty
profile
that
doesnt
become
sticky
alcohol
well
covered
just
the
slightest
hint
of
warmth
as
it
progesses
has
a
nice
malty
taste
a
hearty
lager
as
described
on
the
label
and
one
welldone
a
nice
seasonal
to
transition
from
the
winter
to
the
spring
i
wish
i
had
an
interesting
way
to
start
this
review
i
dont
so
here
we
go
poured
into
my
glass
the
beer
is
a
reddish
amber
color
slightly
cloudy
a
thick
inch
of
beige
head
sits
atop
my
glass
the
aroma
is
caramel
malt
some
sweet
fruit
can
be
found
if
you
really
stick
your
snooter
in
there
the
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
sugar
toast
and
a
cracker
like
breadiness
seems
to
greet
my
tastebuds
theres
a
bitter
alcohol
bite
that
hits
you
when
you
least
expect
it
as
well
medium
to
full
body
thats
rich
and
lightly
carbonated
a
nice
bock
overall
very
drinkable
not
sure
of
the
alcohol
but
its
a
smooth
drinking
beer
with
no
overpowering
flavors
i
was
fairly
impressed
by
this
brew
i
need
to
pick
up
more
of
this
one
the
feel
is
smooth
and
buttery
like
a
milky
consistency
more
watery
at
the
end
overall
ts
a
tad
too
sweet
very
malty
could
use
a
slightly
bitter
balance
but
very
drinkable
pours
a
fair
amber
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
malt
light
caramel
a
little
earthy
the
flavor
is
full
of
nuttiness
slight
toffee
and
earthy
hops
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
overall
im
not
too
big
a
fan
of
the
aroma
on
this
beer
but
the
body
and
flavors
are
nice
d
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
but
the
characters
are
far
from
what
id
expect
in
any
style
of
bock
not
a
great
bock
but
its
fairly
tasty
its
lacking
overall

of

rather

on

this
beer
really
scratched
my
spring
beer
itch
drinkable
as
always
provincial
i
favor
lakefront
a
little
wish
i
had
this
sixer
a
couple
weeks
ago
for
the
first
round
of
the
tourney
dark
amber
with
one
finger
of
white
head
good
amount
of
lacings
aroma
is
some
fruitiness
taste
is
bready
sweet
malts
with
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
make
it
interesting
easy
to
drink
leaves
you
wanting
another
decent
spring
offering
much
better
beer
than
the
last
beer
i
tried
from
this
brewer
to
be
fair
i
think
it
was
quite
old
this
bottle
tasted
quite
fresh
and
clean
very
drinkable
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
are
good
but
the
mouthfeel
really
makes
this
a
beer
worth
savoring
d
it
isnt
bad
at
all
just
missing
some
wow
factor
taste
starts
out
malty
very
slick
and
buttery
like
most
bocks
stronger
than
usual
bitterness
kick
to
the
sides
of
the
mouth
not
at
all
unpleasant
but
unexpected
decent
caramel
aspect
d
not
bad
it
just
strikes
me
as
a
humdrum
bock
im
glad
to
drink
it
but
bock
really
isnt
my
style
and
im
sure
my
deviation
from
the
mean
reflects
this
d
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
id
have
more
than
one
in
an
evening
not
quite
my
flavor
pours
a
clear
ruby
hued
brown
with
a
decent
creme
head
that
doesnt
really
stick
around
flavor
starts
off
nice
and
robust
and
kicks
to
a
pretty
super
sweet
edge
its
nice
but
if
only
it
were
a
bit
more
rounded
and
not
so
tangy
its
be
much
better
to
me
smooth
feel
though
overall
a
bit
too
much
tang
to
make
it
how
id
want
it
to
be
this
tastes
very
smooth
its
not
overly
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
sweet
taste
that
makes
it
flavorful
enough
that
each
concurrent
sip
is
appealing
i
admit
i
am
an
ale
fan
first
and
a
lager
fan
second
but
dark
lagers
like
this
are
a
nice
change
up
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
very
manageable
bock
without
high
alcohol
or
malt
levels
the
subtle
nutty
and
spiced
notes
give
it
a
character
that
is
unique
to
the
style
but
still
remains
a
solid
bock
cheers
the
happy
little
goat
head
on
the
label
looks
at
me
as
if
to
say
how
could
you
not
like
my
beer
i
do
like
it
its
just
that
im
not
exactly
bowled
over
by
what
im
tasting
since
i
havent
been
bowled
over
by
too
many
bocks
perhaps
youd
be
better
off
seeking
someone
elses
opinion
this
was
the
mystery
beer
in
the
8
pack
i
read
through
the
reviews
of
other
lakefront
brews
to
determine
which
beer
it
actually
was
i
did
this
once
i
had
completed
my
review
d
poor
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
brew
but
it
just
isnt
what
it
could
be
im
starting
to
hate
lakefront
i
keep
giving
them
a
chance
but
they
never
deliver
big
malt
in
the
mouth
sweet
and
caramel
flavors
and
plenty
of
currant
to
back
it
up
a
little
slick
full
in
the
mouth
mediumthin
body
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
a
deterrent
the
sweetness
gets
too
much
for
me
but
its
an
easydrinking
bock
drinkability
good
but
not
great
i
think
one
is
enough
on
the
whole
i
was
impressed
by
this
bock
not
as
deep
and
full
as
some
others
but
still
a
nice
easy
drinking
brew
a
good
spring
sessionable
beer
i
know
theres
a
difference
between
malt
and
a
malt
but
this
reminds
me
of
a
little
of
each
the
creaminess
is
inherent
but
the
caramel
is
teased
in
with
minimal
carbonation
and
makes
a
warm
puddle
of
dark
liquer
in
the
stomach
its
what
i
expected
of
the
eastside
by
the
same
brewer
and
didnt
receive
or
it
could
just
be
the
electricity
from
tonights
thunderstorm
ambience
which
is
tricking
my
tastebuds
but
i
dont
think
so
not
a
bad
bock
from
lakefront
pours
out
to
a
dark
ruby
red
color
with
a
short
lived
head
of
cream
colored
foam
medium
low
carbonation
and
a
few
rings
of
lace
aroma
is
very
malty
and
wreaks
of
roasted
earth
with
some
sweet
grain
and
wood
elements
solid
taste
is
quaffable
toasted
bread
and
malt
smooth
over
to
a
raw
grain
note
that
presents
a
creamy
element
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
fair
mild
and
slightly
smooth
drinkability
is
average
ive
had
better
in
the
style
but
this
isnt
bad
this
beer
came
in
a
variety
eight
pack
in
which
all
the
beers
were
dated
to
the
first
week
in
march
so
perhaps
it
is
not
retired
afterall
it
pours
a
black
color
that
is
clear
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
and
opaque
in
the
middle
the
head
is
one
finger
in
height
creamy
and
recedes
rather
slowly
into
a
thin
cap
that
covers
the
entire
glass
the
aroma
is
very
nice
chocolate
burnt
malt
very
sweet
overall
the
taste
of
swweet
burnt
malt
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
a
nice
lingeringly
sweet
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
relaxing
brew
drinkability
is
slightly
above
average
maybe
has
some
potential
but
either
some
age
or
a
little
bit
of
miss
in
brewing
this
batch
makes
the
sourness
a
bit
offputting
clear
dark
brown
color
alost

not
a
lot
of

just
a
thin

of
the

is
nice

malty
raisins
and

very
malty
but
the
body
is
too
thin
for
the
style
alcohol
traces
and
some
hops
on
the
finish
not
too
bad
could
use
a
little
more
body
though
this
might
be
the
darkest
bock
ive
had
in
a
while
i
dont
mind
dark
beer
but
i
feel
they
over
did
it
on
this
one
it
might
have
been
the
stores
fault
but
i
bought
this
beer
and
it
was
already
over
a
year
old
having
said
that
the
beer
tasted
a
little
funny
the
head
was
very
small
but
really
dark
for
its
size
almost
no
lace
at
all
not
that
i
expected
a
lot
from
a
bock
over
all
just
kind
of
a
weird
placed
beer
it
says
its
for
spring
but
its
not
a
seasonal
taste
more
like
an
ale
then
anything
i
ve
tried
four
lakefront
beers
now
and
none
of
them
have
impressed
me
on
the
other
hand
none
have
been
really
horrible
in
the
end
i
say
for
the
money
you
could
get
a
good
local
micro
for
the
same
price
as
a
lakefront
go
with
the
local
brew
if
lakefront
is
your
local
brew
sorry
clear
and
attractive
dark
coppery
brown
appearance
head
is
yellow
ochre
in
color
flattish
but
adequate
wide
slipping
loop
laces
nice
aroma
malty
with
elements
of
sweetened
cherry
and
maple
syrup
almost
like
ihop
pancakes
medium
mouthfeel
lower
carbonation
shows
a
thick
backbone
for
an
ordinary
bock
full
flavor
a
berry
sense
fights
through
the
brown
sugar
maltiness
gives
a
staunch
and
unchanging
flavor
profile
slight
burnt
quality
mid
mouth
finishes
full
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
unmemorable
lighter
beers
in
the
bock
category
this
one
stands
above
them
i
really
like
the
aroma
here
and
stack
this
one
on
the
list
of
lakefronts
notable
brews
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
shortlived
light
tan
head
aroma
consists
of
caramel
malt
raisin
and
brown
sugar
nice
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
the
taste
exhibits
most
of
the
complex
flavors
youd
find
in
a
decent
bock
beer
it
starts
off
with
a
rich
caramal
malt
flavor
sweet
molasses
flavor
coats
the
tongue
midway
and
lingers
into
the
long
finish
it
moves
into
some
vinous
tones
and
that
sweet
caramel
flavor
returns
in
the
finish
hops
dry
the
tongue
out
toward
the
end
lakefronts
bock
seems
a
little
lighter
on
the
raisin
flavor
typically
found
in
most
bocks
but
there
are
strong
vinous
tones
and
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
flavors
appears
slightly
toward
the
back
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
bock
and
something
ill
need
to
revisit
next
spring
pours
out
a
deep
reddish
brown
more
red
than
typical
bronze
coloration
there
is
a
minimal
tan
head
and
no
discrenible
lace
effect
the
nose
is
somewhat
sweet
and
toasted
the
taste
is
a
sweetish
sour
flavor
that
is
disconcerting
at
first
but
becomes
quite
nice
on
the
palate
as
the
glass
is
emptied
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
a
bit
creamy
good
drinkability
overall
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
with
a
small
whitegray
head
smells
of
toffee
and
bready
malt
some
toasted
notes
taste
is
rich
rummy
sweetness
malt
all
the
way
some
hop
presence
comes
in
to
balance
a
little
bit
finish
is
lightly
bitter
with
lingering
sweetness
and
cooked
veggies
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
too
another
good
wi
bock
thanks
to
the
badmonk
for
this
one
one
of
lakefronts
better
beers
if
you
like
sweet
sticky
bocks
this
is
your
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
each
year
a
joy
to
drink
with
considerable
flavor
clear
dark
amber
copper
color
with
a
thin
firm
dusted
brown
head
soft
supple
clean
sweet
bready
malt
nose
with
touches
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
bold
taste
firm
grabbing
sweet
bready
malt
base
thats
lightly
chewy
with
a
light
drying
tang
that
keeps
a
nice
sweet
coating
in
the
mouth
bits
of
herbalness
in
a
very
light
hopping
sneak
through
nearer
the
finish
close
to
full
body
smooth
and
clean
with
a
very
present
sweet
tang
coating
the
palate
leaving
some
chewy
nearly
cloying
effects
across
the
entire
tongue
i
usually
dont
enjoy
the
regular
bocks
due
to
having
accustomedized
my
tastes
towards
the
more
hefty
doppels
this
brings
to
mind
of
something
that
capital
might
put
out
perhaps
a
cross
between
the
blonde
autumnal
fire
and
dark
could
produce
something
similar
to
this
that
said
this
is
a
pretty
straight
up
hefty
bock
that
i
can
finally
put
some
trust
in
for
the
style
a
fine
and
tasty
lager
bock
beer
by
lakefront
thinner
in
body
lighter
than
i
would
have
hoped
for
but
still
a
decent
bock
this
was
a
wonderfulmalty
nutty
tasting
bock
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
the
taste
of
burnt
sugar
and
nuts
was
prominent
and
the
finish
was
smooth
and
delightful
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
this
is
apparently
seasonal
but
i
sure
wish
it
was
available
all
year
round
crystal
clear
scarlet
red
amber
orange
appearance
the
body
is
capped
by
a
nice
looking
light
brown
head
creamy
in
nature
the
lace
is
pretty
full
nice
bready
malt
aroma
a
little
cakey
and
yeasty
small
hints
of
molasses
on
the
nose
as
well
nicely
carbonated
and
almost
a
full
body
for
a
straight
bock
this
has
some
pretty
nice
depth
to
it
cinamon
bread
comes
to
mind
when
tasting
this
and
brown
sugar
and
molasses
and
munich
malts
definitely
munich
malts
here
this
is
a
very
solid
bock
that
could
go
toe
to
toe
with
some
of
the
average
double
bocks
high
drinkability
factor
here
especially
on
tap
but
overall
a
very
nice
bock
brewed
once
a
year
a
nice
treat
pretty
big
to
boot
i
am
guessing
the
abv
is
up
there
for
the
style
o
the
soft
bland
nougat
flavor
dominates
the
other
flavors
when
it
is
cold
it
masks
much
of
the
other
flavors
but
as
it
opens
it
just
gets
more
odd
and
difficult
to
drink
another
italian
special
my
heritage
decent
but
not
great
easy
to
drink
but
not
best
in
class
very
good
though
i
can
finish
a
few
of
these
before
switching
over
this
isnt
bad
i
liked
it
but
if
youre
going
to
call
yourself
a
double
anything
it
ought
to
have
more
punch
flavor
to
it
overall
not
bad
especially
at
the
bargain
price
of
1
99
from
trader
joes
its
a
decent
drinkable
bottle
of
malt
with
an
8
abv
poured
this
bock
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
hazy
copper
color
produced
a
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
it
left
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
a
base
of
sweet
malted
grain
with
hints
of
white
pepper
and
cherry
medium
in
body
the
foundation
of
this
bock
consists
of
a
sweet
malted
grain
base
some
spice
white
pepper
and
cherry
and
apple
juice
overall
it
was
average
odd
variation
of
the
style
overall
for
the
price
at
8
a
good
deal
to
get
your
buzz
going
everything
considered
its
an
interesting
beer
thats
surprisingly
unique
the
execution
could
be
better
but
its
charm
more
than
makes
up
for
its
faults
o
for
the
price
i
was
very
satisfied
with
this
beer
it
is
richer
and
more
complex
than
something
i
would
expect
in
the
bargain
beer
catagory
i
would
drink
this
again
m
d
medium
bodied
rather
plain
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
carbonation
or
crispness
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
ill
be
repeating
anytime
soon
this
pours
a
ruby
ambermalty
color
with
tight
foam
i
found
an
ok
maltysweet
aroma
to
it
with
something
akin
to
candied
cherries
and
a
light
caramel
aroma
the
flavor
comes
across
as
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
dialed
down
sweetness
thin
bodied
for
the
style
thinner
than
i
had
expected
at
any
rate
theres
a
light
bitterness
with
some
carameltoffee
hints
pleasant
enough
but
not
one
that
id
recommend
for
anyone
with
a
love
of
dopplebocks
im
sure
he
swigged
some
o
this
whilst
not
fiddling
eh
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
fake
runtlike
banana
maple
syrup
light
biscuit
powdered
sugar
and
light
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
strangely
candied
orange
peel
which
lends
a
cloying
sweetness
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
everything
else
damn
delinquents
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
an
odd
bock
one
that
goes
all
over
the
place
before
landing
in
an
unappetizing
place
even
for
the
price
theres
plenty
better
out
there
folks
other
than
being
in
a
cool
bottle
and
available
pretty
cheap
from
trader
joes
this
beer
isnt
all
it
claims
to
be
poured
a
half
inch
offwhite
fine
froth
head
with
reasonable
lifespan
the
body
is
a
slightly
hazy
burn
sienna
color
not
dark
at
all
like
the
name
claims
it
does
smell
of
complex
malt
but
then
when
you
drink
it
although
you
do
get
malt
its
not
nearly
as
malty
as
id
expected
certainly
not
double
dark
malt
its
still
enjoyable
though
and
a
decent
value
in
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
streaks
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
some
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
has
a
pretty
good
smell
but
the
taste
doesnt
match
up
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
better
version
of
similar
beers
like
amber
bock
or
shiner
bock
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
may
not
turn
any
heads
but
is
totally
worth
it
at
only
2
99
for
a
bottle
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
of
a
doppelbock
to
me
but
it
stands
up
just
fine
as
a
bock
yup
its
a
doppelbock
all
the
bock
yeast
flavors
and
sweet
musty
malts
that
should
be
there
are
present
nice
medium
body
for
an
easydrinking
quality
in
spite
of
its
8
abv
all
in
all
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
worth
buying
for
the
beugel
bottle
if
youd
like
to
have
a
500ml
of
those
around
for
your
own
bottling
operations
a
soso
beer
a
little
off
the
beaten
path
style
wise
i
was
hoping
would
be
better
but
i
did
buy
it
at
trader
joes
after
all
and
it
was
rather
cheap
for
some
reason
i
had
hoped
it
was
a
belgian
dubbel
but
bocks
are
good
too
o
ok
so
its
not
often
that
i
give
a
beer
all
the
same
number
ranking
across
the
board
but
this
one
fit
the
bill
good
but
not
exceptional
in
every
category
tasty
although
not
especially
complex
id
drink
it
again
although
there
are
others
i
like
better
for
the
same
price
onot
a
bock
nor
a
brown
ale
more
like
a
sour
ale
i
think
i
think
this
would
go
well
with
barbecued
chicken
or
other
hearty
foods
may
repurchase
again
drinkability
was
solidly
good
overall
a
decent
value
brew
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
plus
you
get
a
sweet
minigrowler
out
of
of
the
deal
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
a
double
munich
dunkel
smooth
and
sweet
with
some
dry
grains
to
make
it
a
bock
still
light
bodied
but
full
flavors
of
boozy
raisins
finishes
very
bready
reminiscent
of
rye
bread
poured
into
a
stemmed
beer
glass
light
caramel
colored
body
decent
looking
head
smell
was
nutty
and
fruity
taste
was
mostly
average
it
was
very
onenote
all
it
featured
was
malt
no
layers
of
flavor
at
all
plus
the
mouthfeel
was
very
sticky
sweet
and
a
bit
hot
from
the
abv
not
extremely
enjoyable
to
drink
but
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
as
this
was
a
fairly
cheaply
priced
beer
not
a
horrible
beer
to
gamble
on
for
3
99
cool
bottle
at
least
the
color
when
poured
in
pint
glass
was
medium
dark
brown
with
a
minimum
amount
of
foam
and
no
lace
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
was
very
evident
along
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
was
of
the
roasted
malts
bittersweet
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
caramel
nice
long
flavorful
bittersweet
aftertaste
just
remember
the
is
a
malt
ale
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
overall
this
is
one
that
deserves
taking
a
pass
i
wont
be
revisiting
f
overall
not
a
great
beer
flavors
are
muddled
and
just
not
all
that
good
i
had
high
hopes
but
was
disappointed
oh
well
overall
id
rate
this
beer
as
ok
there
are
many
just
ok
beers
out
there
i
think
this
is
a
fine
beer
to
introduce
a
newbie
to
craft
beers
someone
whos
been
weaned
on
american
adjuncts
maybe
for
guys
your
gf
but
as
a
bock
its
lacking
in
body
strength
and
presence
this
beer
is
not
going
to
replace
ones
daily
bread
500ml
bottle
from
trader
joes
this
one
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
color
there
was
a
wisp
of
a
white
head
that
didnt
leave
any
lacing
aroma
is
mainly
caramel
malt
a
little
grassiness
and
something
else
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
taste
is
ok
but
not
great
caramel
a
little
alcohol
touch
astringent
not
much
sweetness
just
rates
an
ok
dont
know
if
ill
be
back
for
another
one
overall
not
an
enjoyable
beer
but
hard
to
pinpoint
the
specific
flavor
element
that
made
the
beer
taste
odd
i
guess
honeycaramelgrassiness
is
as
close
as
i
can
come
o
meh
its
drinkable
at
least
but
without
the
novelty
of
something
cheap
like
simpler
times
overall
i
didnt
dig
the
apecchio
and
im
not
digging
the
ddma
i
bought
this
at
trader
joes
and
while
they
sell
some
decent
beers
this
is
definitely
not
one
of
them
what
a
shame
o
judging
it
against
other
bocks
im
afraid
that
it
doesnt
measure
up
the
sweet
caramel
flavors
were
ok
but
i
kept
getting
the
sense
of
stale
beer
like
in
a
frat
house
basement
deep
brown
with
an
orange
hue
fluffy
two
finger
pale
yellow
head
with
nice
retention
smoky
rye
and
wheat
bread
and
molasses
in
the
aroma
rye
bread
dark
malts
and
bourbon
on
the
first
sip
big
bready
malty
mouthfeel
not
much
else
penetrates
big
oat
flavors
with
smooth
molasses
and
fresh
malts
really
enjoyable
bock
very
simple
the
palate
is
quite
pleasing
with
some
more
of
that
unexpected
clovey
spice
and
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
soft
bitterness
i
am
not
sure
how
classic
a
bock
this
is
but
i
like
it
its
a
kind
of
cheap
and
rustic
brew
but
then
its
three
dollars
instead
of
ten
so
it
gives
a
lot
of
beery
intrigue
for
the
buck
not
to
mention
the
alcohol
factor
bound
to
impress
the
ladies
with
the
sophisticated
swing
top
and
that
little
gasp
as
they
gulp
down
a
good
dose
of
inhibitionreleasing
and
oh
never
mind
visit
your
local
trader
joes
500
ml
bottle
from
trader
joes
pours
red
with
a
short
lived
white
head
and
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
grassy
hops
and
some
funk
malt
hops
and
booze
unpleasantly
combine
on
the
palate
it
was
a
drain
pour
beer
for
me
what
a
waste
of
money
the
taste
is
drier
than
the
smell
the
caramel
is
present
in
the
swallow
light
hop
which
i
think
adds
to
the
flavor
short
aftertaste
appropriately
full
bodied
with
an
above
average
level
of
carbonation
a
curious
and
not
very
pleasant
offering
though
it
is
inexpensive
i
wouldnt
call
it
worth
the
price
unless
youre
collecting
it
for
the
bottle
o
wouldnt
buy
again
not
terrible
but
not
a
well
executed
beer
overall
this
beer
was
decent
but
left
me
wanting
more
from
it
i
will
try
this
brewers
other
beers
before
i
get
this
one
again
if
anything
the
bottle
is
cool
and
easily
reusable
for
homebrew
final
thought
3
and
8
abv
so
my
question
why
not
in
general
i
had
high
hopes
for
these
beers
given
the
provenance
and
the
attractive
packaging
i
guess
i
shouldnt
judge
the
beer
by
the
bottling
initially
it
looked
that
this
was
going
to
be
good
but
the
aftertaste
killed
the
mood
not
a
particularly
fun

bittering
at
the

i
actually
liked
the
mouthfeel
its
rich
enough
yet
still
easy
only
a
touch
of
the
alcohol
i
actually
did
like
this
beer
but
its
no
doppelbock
a
nice
strong
bockale
hybrid
i
didnt
remember
trader
joes
beers
being
such
duds
with
the
exception
of
the
annual
holiday
ale
of
course
though
cheap
theres
just
not
much
too
this
mediocre
taste
at
best
for
the
quantityalcoholprice
it
is
not
horrible
but
picking
up
something
of
the
same
style
yet
better
for
the
same
price
is
an
easy
task
o
this
is
my
first
go
at
this
style
since
i
started
reviewing
while
i
lean
more
to
west
coast
dipas
and
belgian
styles
this
is
something
that
will
be
in
my
fridge
again
when
the
malt
mood
strikes
enjoyable
experiment
ty
to
the
trader
joes
guy
that
recommended
trying
it
ok
so
the
beer
is
60
birra
al

and
40
red
ale
presumably
the
same
red
ale
thats
used
in
the
other
nero
beer
that
just
hit
trader
joes
still
not
exactly
sure
what
to
classify
it
as
im
a
heffe
weizen
fan
but
this
one
is
also
great
rjt
it
is
thick
and
malty
in
the
flavor
and
again
just
pure
bockstyled
malt
as
the
flavor
it
actually
isnt
too
sweet
though
but
it
is
a
onetrickpony
d
a
little
too
and
too
sweet
to
quaff
but
no
problem
plowing
through
an

2
oz

smells
like
its
going
to
be
heavy
but
it
isnt
very

and

very
refreshing
i
would
definitely
have
this

again
really
drinkable
taste
caramel

very

mild

drinkability
is

the

are

its
a
pretty

surprised
but
not
disappointed
with
this
easy
drinking
7
brew
on
a
side
note
my
great
grandfather
came
to
this
country
from
salzburg
so
i
was
excited
when
i
found
out
where
this
one
was
from
im
sure
he
would
approve
in
all
i
d
like
to
drink
this
again
soon
oh
yeah
mmm
excellent
bock
beer
poured
with
a
big
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
and
a
little
lace
lovely
medium
amber
color
but
lighter
than
most
bocks
i
see
aroma
is
very
beery
malty
and
hoppy
right
away
in
tasting
i
get
malt
sweetness
thats
immediately
tempered
with
plenty
of
hops
for
great
balance
the
mouthfeel
goes
with
it
in
great
carbonation
and
body
definite
alcohol
warming
could
be
a
session

but
for
the
strength
real
easy
to
have
at
least
another

poured
a
light

that
settled
to

the
drink

and
more
throughout
the
taste

was
the
highlight
of
this
beer
for
me
sweetness
some
light
carmel
in
there
with
a
watered
finish
with
taste
of
farmearthgrain
though
not
a
detractor
quite
drinkable
conclusion
simple
this
is
a
bit
overly
sweet
and
theres
not
much
going
on
its
ok
but
only
ok

very

the

impression
is
watery
where
the

then
a

with

in

to

id
like
to
think
of
it
as
a
hellesbock
as
its
not
really
either
and
quite
distinct
from
a
strong
eurolager
and
those
who
confuse
this
for

should
know
better

and
something
i
wish
i
would

tried

was

my
original

still
stands

plus
neutered

if
that
doesnt
sound
very
good
believe
me
it
isnt
is
a
lack

enough
to
recommend
a
beer
not
to
me
it
isnt

along
theres
nothing
here
that
deserves

look

more
like
a
pilsner

i
mus
admit
incorporates
the
alcohol
content
well
into
the
palate
for
such
a
pilsnery
dopplebock
a
damn
tasty
bock
that
is
somewhere
near
the
line
that
separates
dry
bock
from
malty
pilsner
i
suggest
you
dont
quibble
about
the
exact
classification
and
just
enjoy
this
i
prefer
to
think
of
it
as
a
sweetish
pilsner

that

the

i
probably
would
have
liked
this
to
be
a

beefier
but
all
in

this
is
not

id
consider
it
for
an
introduction

the

oa
nice

very
sweet
at
the

however
the
alcohol
is
the

is
a

o

no

nice
o

in

this
is
a

very
smooth
drinker
i
have
not
had
too
much
from
the
style
but
this
is
a
very
smooth
mainstream
version
try
if
you
like
a
smooth
bock
there
are
a
few
things
off
about
this
beer
which
is
disappointing
since
im
a
fan
of
bocks
and
have
enjoyed
most
of
the
other
leviathan
series
beers
things
started
off
wrong
with
the
aroma
and
just
couldnt
impress
with
the
taste
a
good
combination
of
sweet
with
a
bitter
hop
kicker
rich
like
a
bock
should
be
the
carbonation
is
low
almost
flat
the
alcohol
presence
is
very
subtle
the
aftertaste
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
malted
sugars
and
peppery
hop
o
definitely
drinkable
and
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
worth
a
try
i
feel
the
bock
should
be
a
clean
smooth
aloholic
brew
that
exihibits
malt
complexity
the
yeastfermentation
took
away
the
from
the

if

worked
on
that
it
would
be

the

a
dry

in
the

bigger
and
ok
but
bit
too
much

quick
buzz
overall
not
great
has
some
iffy
flavors
off
flavors
as
well
with
phenols
and
esters
some
herbal
bitter
flavors
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
as
well
and
sticky
sweet
overall
the
worst
of
all
the
leviathan
beers
so
far
not
terrible
but
not
good
taste
is
pretty
damn
sweet
lighter
than
caramel
but
not
quite
sugary
either
lets
go
with
burnt

nutty

maltiness
is
interesting
but
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
pleasant
little
bit
of
dry
bitterness
on
the
finish
alcohol
probably
more
accountable
than
hops
there
is
a
strange
vegetal
flavor
i
am
getting
that
is
not
all
that
cool
i
can
see
why
this
is
not
a
doppelbock
it
just
doesnt
have
the
malt
backing
and
body
for
it
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
the
leviathan
series
is
about
5050
for
me
the
half
i
do
like
i
think
are
spectacular
though
like
the
triticus
and
quad
one
thing
they
always
are
is
interesting
so
i
say
carry
on
harpoon
carry
on
overall
this
is
a
good
bock
and
certainly
evidences
a
great
amount
of
care
on
harpoons
part
the
flavors
are
huge
and
the
result
is
delicious
my
only
concerns
are
that
at
times
the
beer
can
get
slightly
too
yeasty
for
my
tastes
and
there
is
a
hint
of
a
vodkalike
alcohol
tinge
at
the
edges

pretty
clear
copper
with
a
big

nice

throughout
smell
initially
is
grassy
hops
actually
a
very
generic
beer
smell
surprising
for
this
beer
but
after
taking
a
sip
im
getting
a
little
more
caramel
smell
taste
is
pretty
nice
balanced
with
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
and
herbalgrassy
hoppiness
yeah
its
sweet
but
not
so
sweet
as
to
be
a
negative
i
think
the
real
problem
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
pretty
bad
i
feel
like
this
is
very
undercarbonated
somehow
it
poured
with
a
big
head
but
halfway
through
it
seems
like
theres
no
carbonation
too
heavy
and
syrupy
overall
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
in
summation
its
okay
it
has
a
nice
flavor
but
the
mouthfeel
kills
it
honestly
this
beer
is
making
me
appreciate
the
mouthfeel
category
here
on
beeradvocate
more
than
ever
before
very
necessary
it
turns
out
as
this
beer
tastes
nice
but
the
mouthfeel
kills
it
a
very
strong
bock
as
they
advertise
the
strength
of
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
take
away
from
this
one
for
me
a
spice
attack
as
well

doesnt
completely
rape
and
pillage
your
palate
mouthfeel
is
big
bodied
but
not
cloyingly
so
its
a
nice
gentle
giant
with
a
hint
of
harshness
from
the
minimal
booze
detected
malt
laiden
on
the
palate
but
i
wouldnt
say
this
one
ever
reaches
the
realm
of
cloying
its
more
like
a
slow
bubbled
carbonation
in
a
big
bodied
beer
overall
a
great
malty
beer
that
compares
to
sierra
nevadas
recent
big
bock
bier
comes
from
a
similar
vein
without
being
a
knockoff
actually
different
to
brew
a
bigger
malt
addition
offering
without
an
explosion
of
alpha
hops
its
amazing
how
beer
this
good
is
now
off
the
beaten
path
clear
coppery
orange
with
a
short
cap
of
fine
offwhite
foam
fair
head
retention
a
bit
of
sticky
lacing
malty
aroma
cereal
grain
and
some
sweetness
fairly
clean
but
with
some
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
fruit
buttery
caramel
and
light
hops
caramel
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
grainy
sugary
notes
and
alcohol
in
the
finish
slightly
fruity
with
bitterness
lurking
just
underneath
the
malts
hints
of
marshmallow
and
hops
decent
texture
full
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
moderate
alcohol
warmth
overall
it
was
alright
a
little
hotter
than
i
would
have
liked
but
i
did
enjoy
some
of
the
malt
character
i
am
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
from
the
leviathan
series
though
i
have
come
to
expect
a
lot
out
of
these
and
this
one
was
disappointing
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
in
the
spring
but
it
was
just
meh
for
me
o
i
love
the
leviathan
series
but
this
one
isnt
doing
it
for
me
dont
get
me
wrong
i
know
i
sound
down
on
this
one
but
with
a
few
tweaks
this
could
be
a
very
good
beer
first
beer
is
super
thin
big
disappointment
mildly
alcoholic
bready
grainy
acidity
in
the
back
odd
beer
overall
not
a
great
example
in
my
opinion
i
wont
have
it
again
not
sure
what
to
say
other
than
this
is
one
beer
i
wont
be
ordering
again

hooksett
nh
not

bad
ive
seen
better
examples
where
the
alcohol
is
hidden
better
still
worth
a
try
o
honestly
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
one
its
good
but
slightly
overwhelming
definitely
worth
trying
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
an
average
white
head
with
a
thin
collar
as
it
goes
down
the
nose
is
heavy
on
bread
and
is
actually
quite
grainy
no
real
hop
character
or
anything
else
perhaps
a
bit
of
booze
the
flavor
is
bready
and
mildly
sweet
with
quite
a
bit
of
raw
grain
average
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
and
grainy
tannic
character
in
the
finish
not
a
huge
fan
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
slightly
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
although
heavier
than
most
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
bottle
poured
a
clear
medium
amber
color
bock
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
solid
caramelized
sugar
with
balanced
sweetness
level
is
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
an
easily
drinkable
mix
between
some
caramelized
malt
with
balanced
sweetness
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
well
brewed
with
nice
balanced
with
great
drinkability
factor
and
limited
complexity
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
pilsner
and
munich
malt
scent
along
with
a
touch
of
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
munich
malt
flavor
its
silky
smooth
going
down
with
a
rich
sweet
maltiness
that
lingers
in
the
finish
along
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
maibock
its
a
tad
syrupy
which
may
turn
people
off
but
the
malt
character
is
damn
good
i
would
drink
it
again
but
am
not
overly
impressed
a
big
maibock
with
intense
flavors
but
some
imbalance
not
a
bad
offering
but
not
quite
drinkable
a
very
good
beer
with
a
copper
color
that
is
deep
and
clear
with
a
thin
biege
head
as
you
get
ready
to
take
a
drink
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
the
traditional
german
ales
the
first
taste
reminds
me
of
caramel
and
finishing
with
a
slight
bitterness
a
very
good
beer
that
went
well
with
the
vermonter
panini
at
the
harpoon
brewery
in
windsor
vt
overall
id
say
this
is
an
above
average
offering
though
not
by
much
fully
quaffable
but
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
the
leviathan
series
overall
it
was
ok
agree
it
could
be
a
little
smoother
and
not
so
hot
in
taste
but
maybe
some
aging
would
help
that
632
color
is
an
amber
brown
color
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
little
nutty
taste
there
is
a
very
weak
smell
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
weak
this
beer
is
like
most
other
saranac
beers
if
it
were
a
pitcher
it
would
be
todd
wellmeyer
its
a
solid
but
it
will
not
overwhelm
you
if
you
do
not
like
a
malty
roasty
bock
this
would
be
for
you
an
interesting
bock
with
enough
flavor
to
satisfy
my
tastebuds
d

overall
its
a
pretty
average
brew
the
mouthfeel
dropped
a
couple
of
points
on
this
one
as
did
the
ethereal
taste
still
a
much
better
beer
than
most
saranac
offerings
and
most
other
offerings
youll
find
on
the
rack
with
it
at
your
local
grocery
store
this
beer
has
a
nice
golden
hue
with
a
nice
sticky
white
head
that
has
a
nice
lacing
that
sticks
around
there
is
not
a
huge
aroma
from
this
beer
but
no
unplesant
aromas
either
the
flavor
is
very
nice
not
too
hoppy
and
and
has
a
nice
almost
smokey
malt
flavor
smoke
may
not
be
the
right
term
but
it
has
that
feel
the
body
is
medium
and
smooth
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
solid
very
enjoyable
beer
to
consume
out
of
a
winter
12
pack
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
held
for
a
while
then
faded
to
just
covering
the
beer
with
some
thin
spotty
lace
fruity
floral
aromas
with
a
big
bready
malt
taste
with
a
touch
caramel
and
a
slightly
salty
tasting
finish
light
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
good
session
beer
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
not
something
i
would
seek
out
bet
nice
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
winter
sampler
12
pack
but
still
not
a
particularly
notable
one
i
wouldnt
search
this
one
out
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
worth
a
try
i
would
say
12oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
decent
lace
good
caramel
malt
smells
mixed
with
just
enough
hop
aroma
although
perhaps
a
bit
much
for
a
bock
nice
rich
caramel
malt
flavors
but
a
bit
too
much
hop
flavorbitterness
at
the
end
at
least
for
a
bock
anyway
good
flavor
though
better
than
the
black
diamond
bock
imo
a
decent
offering
medium
reddishamber
with
a
mediumsized
offwhite
frothy
slowlydiminishing
head
some
tiny
particles
floating
around
in
it
and
the
case
wasnt
old
or
mishandled
all
other
beers
in
the
12
beers
case
were
fine
smell
is
of
mild
malt
and
very
light
fruit
taste
is
mostly
bready
malt
with
caramel
and
some
hops
showing
up
on
the
finish
but
mostly
just
to
impart
some
bitterness
it
has
a
mediumfull
body
dry
texture
and
low
carbonation
overall
its
not
bad
just
nothing
special
f
x
matt
has
delivered
a
beautiful
beer
in
their
saranac
bock
from
its
glowing
orangechestnut
body
and
creamy
tan
head
to
its
lingering
finish
its
a
winner
it
offers
a
very
nice
appearance
of
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
and
chestnut
with
a
crimsonorange
cast
and
glowing
orange
and
gold
highlights
good
head
retention
good
lacing
the
beautifully
malty
aroma
expresses
a
bit
of
toastiness
and
dark
caramel
as
well
as
some
floral
leafy
and
spicy
hops
in
the
mouth
its
smooth
with
a
lightly
dextrinous
body
and
just
enough
veryfinebubbled
carbonation
to
give
a
gentle
zest
to
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
and
malty
but
not
sweet
its
grainy
toffeeish
and
caramelish
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
spicy
and
floral
hops
and
an
underlying
acidity
it
finishes
dry
and
floral
with
a
spicy
hop
and
alcohol
accent
its
not
the
biggest
or
the
most
malty
or
even
the
most
drinkable
but
it
is
really
well
done
and
accessible
with
a
decent
amount
of
character
worth
trying
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
the
smuttynose
old
brown
dog
ale
now
i
wish
my
sampler
didnt
contain
just
one
bock
i
could
probably
drink
these
for
a
night
if
my
choices
were
slim
oelergud
sure
you
could
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
you
might
even
like
it
but
theres
no
reason
to
settle
for
such
an
average
beer
beer
is
amber
in
color
with
a
fair
sized
offwhite
head
that
has
some
retention
and
left
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
malt
caramel
seems
to
come
out
the
most
but
also
a
biscuit
like
property
the
taste
is
mostly
of
malts
caramel
again
along
with
a
roasted
flavor
that
seems
to
go
pretty
well
together
and
finishes
with
the
lightest
of
hops
as
it
is
there
a
sec
and
gone
the
next
over
all
this
is
a
middle
of
the
road
brew
not
something
to
write
home
about
but
not
a
bad
offering
it
is
easy
to
drink
drinkabilitynot
bad
id
have
another
a
bock
that
is
too
thin
and
lacking
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
for
my
taste
not
a
terrible
lager
but
not
well
crafted
stylistically
a
watered
down
bock
with
some
flavor
but
lacking
in
overall
presence
copper
pour
releases
some
bready
malt
aromas
not
much
different
on
tasting
only
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
rounding
out
the
profile
not
much
here
but
it
is
drinkable
like
most
of
saranacs
offerings
it
is
a
good
intro
to
the
style
for
those
scared
of
better
tasting
brews
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
offwite
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
malty
scent
along
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
yet
malty
flavor
that
boasts
of
a
mild
crystal
malt
and
not
much
else
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
some
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
too
impressive
d
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
this
would
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
when
ordering
a
brew
nothing
that
blows
me
awayhow
come
saranac
seems
to
be
a
pedestrian
brewery
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
small
tan
head
dissipated
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
no
real
distinct
aroma
slight
malt
not
much
hop
detected
slightly
sweet
malt
taste
mild
bitterness
again
nothing
distinct
this
lager
goes
down
easy
has
a
light
body
moderately
carbonated
crisp
ovarall
a
decent
bock
this
one
would
go
great
with
a
pork
roast
dinner
a
decent
offering
in
the
12
beers
of
christmas
pack
worth
a
try
if
you
can
pick
up
the
mixed
case
pours
a
very
clear
bronze
with
copper
highlights
dense
two
finger
head
offwhite
in
color
and
holds
a
cap
well
leaving
spotty
lace
crystal
and
lots
of
pale
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
light
noble
hop
aroma
toasty
munich
and
vienna
maltiness
upfront
followed
by
caramel
and
slight
dextrinous
taste
hop
profile
is
perhaps
more
assertive
than
appropriate
but
the
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
really
balances
out
this
malty
beer
along
with
plenty
of
floral
hallertau
and
spicy
saaz
flavor
the
mediumfull
body
and
light
carbonation
exaggerate
the
rich
malt
character
creating
a
heavier
mouthfeel
and
lingering
sweetness
without
cloying
finishes
residual
with
an
evenly
matched
german
hop
acidity
allowing
a
good
drinkability
got
this
in
the
saranac
12
beers
of
winter
sampler
so
far
this
is
the
best
of
the
bunch
i
once
tasted
wagners
sled
dog
dopplebock
and
really
disliked
the
strong
flavor
and
wasnt
sure
how
i
was
going
to
like
this
bock
beer
when
i
saw
the
dark
color
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
tasted
it
it
had
a
creamy
mouthfeel
rich
malty
flavor
and
smooth
finish
this
was
an
excellent
tasting
lager
and
was
much
better
tasting
than
saranacs
adirondack
lager
i
would
like
to
see
saranac
add
this
one
to
their
regular
lineup
as
well
dark
lager
is
the
description
and
yes
is
a
spring
bock
or
doppelbock
it
is
closer
to
a
doppelbock
in
color
and
a
spring
hybrid
bock
in
flavor
smooth
chocolate
overtones
malty
nose
full
body
with
very
little
ibu
or
hop
bitterness
an
adventurous
enjoyable
beer
from
saranac
the
drinkability
was
about
average
but
i
would
have
a
few
if
i
felt
the
need
this
brew
pours
a
very
light
brown
color
thats
accented
with
a
reddish
hue
its
very
clear
with
a
nice
albeit
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
lightly
toasted
malt
the
beer
presents
a
significant
sweet
malt
smell
but
its
richness
and
depth
could
be
a
little
more
intense
the
beer
is
modestly
sweet
with
a
clean
fresh
bread
crust
flavor
the
finish
has
a
slight
herbal
bitterness
appropriately
theres
not
much
hop
flavor
in
the
beer
medium
body
and
fairly
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
clean
and
drinkable
bock
although
its
respectable
there
are
a
lot
of
better
bocks
out
there
cheers
a
fairly
average
bock
overall
the
metallic
aftertaste
brings
it
down
a
bit
but
otherwise
not
bad
appears
an
amber
hue
with
an
off
white
toffee
toned
head
hue
leaves
ample
lacing
all
around
my
glass
aroma
has
a
nice
warming
biscuit
malt
with
sweet
caramel
and
evident
herbal
hops
with
a
touch
of
metallic
character
flavor
has
a
mild
roasty
caramel
malt
with
more
herbal
hop
flavors
and
light
alcohol
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
even
smooth
carbonation
im
diggin
their
take
on
the
bock
not
a
bad
brew
drinkability
is
quality
with
six
percent
abv
it
has
some
flavor
with
some
nice
drinkability
going
on
juicy
caramel
and
toasted
malts
dominate
the
sip
syrupy
and
sweet
with
a
malty
backbone
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
with
a
mini
hop
presence
pours
maple
syrup
caramel
brown
no
head
at
all
you
can
definitly
smell
some
kind
of
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
kind
of
as
expected
very
smooth
definitly
some
caramel
notes
lacks
a
little
in
the
mouthfeel
slightly
flat
tasting
but
overall
really
good
of
the
three
beers
ive
tried
out
of
the
sampler
so
far
black
forest
beligian
ale
and
bock
i
would
definitly
rank
this
one
second
the
black
forest
is
awesome
all
in
all
decent
would
like
to
maybe
get
a
sixer
of
this
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
beer
easy
to
drink
md
kind
of
flat
nice
flavor
and
blend
but
not
completely
satisfying
but
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
d
very
drinkable
with
a
moderate
abv
this
is
a
real
star
from
the
winter
case
its
nice
to
see
a
few
new
things
coming
from
matt
even
if
they
are
not
greatpoured
a
medium
broze
color
with
a
thinner
quick
to
fade
head
muted
aromas
mainly
caramel
malt
with
a
light
toastinesspretty
thin
mouthfeel
for
even
a
smaller
bock
like
this
not
quite

but
not

you
would

it

a
decent
peppery

profile
comes
thru

a
decent
but
subtle
stab
at
a
bock
here
its
drinkable
but
lacks
alot
of
character
in
my
mind
d
not
bad
im
usually
not
big
on
bocks
but
i
could
do
this
again
pours
a
clear

color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
of
tan
bubbles
light
sweet
aroma
noble
hops
come
out
more
as
it
warms
first
thing
noticed
upon
sipping
was
a
rather
thin
body
flavors
were
on
the
light
side
as
well
biscuits
and
honey
grainy
light
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
boring
bock
nothing
offensive
but
not
up
to
the
standards
of
others
in
this
category
a
newfound
variety
to
me
not
that
i
hadnt
seen
them
before
but
only
recently
have
i
bought
and
enjoyed
traditional
bock
beers
most
of
the
others
from
germany
id
tried
another
rather
popular
bock
style
from
a
us
brewery
and
found
it
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
or
write
ba
about
so
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
try
a
version
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
incredibly
rich
color
and
head
retention
with
a
nice
malty
flavor
and
richness
augmented
by
subtle
carbonation
just
enough
hops
even
a
bit
more
than
expected
to
balance
the
flavor
while
not
detracting
from
the
malt
my
sample
bottle
came
from
my
12
beers
of
winter
variety
pack
but
id
buy
this
by
the
6er
or
the
case
if
i
could
12
ouncer
that
came
in
the
latest
saranac
sampler
no
freshness
dating
on
any
of
em
pours
pretty
tame
almond
amber
so
much
for
being
a
dark
lager
dark
tan
larger
bubble
head
that
leaves
a
smidge
of
lacing
malty
nose
as
was
expected
smooth
malty

notes
of
bread
yeast
maple
drinkable
serviceable
little
brew
nothing
special
pretty
typical
middle
of
the
road
saranac
offering
overall
a
very
solid
bock
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
a
very
nice
offering
from
saranac
poured
12oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
nice
dark
lager
deep
amber
color
with
almost
a
tannish
head
the
smell
of
the
malt
immediately
rises
to
the
top
of
the
glass
after
the
pour
with
the
malt
hitting
your
lips
as
soon
as
you
taste
it
german
style
beer
with
almost
a
dubbel
taste
nice
thick
mouthfeel
saranacs
description
of
a
rich
fullbodied
beer
is
right
on
the
nose
highly
recommended
drinkability
another
decent
but
not
overwhelming
beer
from
saranac
a
bit
more
maltiness
in
the
flavor
would
bring
it
up
a
notch
since
it
is
milder
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
bock
a
solid
beer
i
poured
from
a
12
ounze
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
and
was
suprised
at
how
much
less
head
i
got
from
this
than
any
others
from
saranac
the
smell
was
sweet
yet
not
sweet
i
know
that
doesnt
make
sense
but
thats
the
best
i
can
describe
it
the
taste
was
a
good
bitter
taste
but
not
awful
strong
it
went
down
very
smooth
dont
drink
and
review
a
pretty
decent
beer
considering
saranacs
low
price
looks
a
touch
light
for
a
bock
but
still
managed
a
pretty
amber
color
with
offwhite
head
im
never
quite
sure
how
to
describe
bock
flavor
but
i
know
it
when
i
taste
it
or
smell
it
the
sweet
caramel
and
licorishlike
malts
are
there
although
not
terrible
rich
theres
also
a
bit
of
a
spicey
hot
hops
element
to
this
brew
it
seems
saranac
has
been
uping
their
hops
in
a
couple
brews
lately
awesome
overall
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
the
price
tasty
and
very
drinkable
but
no
award
winner
d
im
sampling
this
from
their
winter
12pack
and
im
not
sure
if
thats
the
only
way
to
purchase
it
i
believe
it
is
this
was
honestly
better
than
i
expected
its
still
milder
than
german
bocks
but
its
not
bad
id
enjoy
this
again
taste
is
caramel
and
toasty
malt
with
a
light
bittering
and
some
nutty
tones
in
the
finish
some
dextrin
chewyness
not
bad
as
a
mediumbodied
lager
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
definitely
a
malt
lovers
brew
that
i
am
having
no
trouble
drinking
easily
not
a
complex
or
crazy
beer
but
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
and
little
o
the
sweet
side
without
being
cloying
i
enjoy
this
one
trying
this
one
out
of
the
winter
sampler
2012
first
of
all
the
bottle
art
is
a
ten
it
made
me
laugh
really
hard
for
no
reason
the
color
is
a
redishbrown
smelling
it
from
the
bottle
and
then
from
a
glass
it
smells
a
tad
bit
sweet
unfortunately
thats
where
the
fun
ends
the
taste
at
first
was
a
little
weak
and
a
little
watery
the
aftertaste
was
decent
but
nothing
special
good
warm
mouthfeel
not
sure
if
id
buy
this
again
outside
of
the
sampler
overall
an
average
beer
that
works
well
in
the
winter
season
wouldnt
seek
it
out
on
its
own
but
has
its
place
in
the
winter
mix
pack
overall
pretty
on
par
for
the
style
but
didnt
really
wow
me
pretty
good
for
saranac
though
saranacs
best
beer
was
brewed
for
limited
time
last
winter
to
go
with
ski
season
but
now
since
it
was
in
such
high
demand
it
is
an
all
year
round
brew
from
what
i
am
told
dark
heavy
beer
but
with
great
flavor
and
good
drinkability
even
the
label
on
the
bottle
is
fun
to
look
at
depicting
a
bear
with
skis
saranac
trys
to
encorperate
bears
into
all
thier
labels
it
seems
def
give
this
one
a
try
you
will
be
happy
you
did
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
standard
shaker
pint
glass
the
lager
appears
a
medium
chestnut
color
with
about
an
inch
of
fizzy
ecru
foam
aroma
and
taste
is
dominated
by
fair
amount
of
malt
caramel
bitter
earthy
hops
a
bit
sweet
nice
satisfying
body
with
ample
carbonation
a
nice
malty
bock
at
a
good
price
drinkability
stylistically
this
is
definitely
a
bock
and
even
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
cant
say
its
the
best
one
ive
ever
had
though
the
notes
are
mostly
here
its
just
a
little
dull
shallow
watery
cheap
no
thats
harsh
its
good
for
what
it
is
but
its
not
one
id
reach
for
again
m
d
a
little
bit
of
a
stickiness
in
the
body
an
assertive
but
not
overdone
carbonation
in
the
past
ive
always
detected
an
unusual
metallic
type
taste
that
i
had
just
associated
with
being
a
saranac
thing
it
wasnt
really
my
thing
but
this
particular
beer
doesnt
appear
to
have
that
quality
quite
a
nice
brew
which
has
me
interested
in
revisiting
other
beers
from
the
brewery
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
guess
i
was
always
figuring
this
to
be
a
heavier
stout
from
the
black
diamond
name
never
looking
closely
to
see
that
it
was
actually
a
bock
and
not
a
stout
this
could
be
a
session
beer
it
is
not
heavy
and
has
a
good
flavor

i
also
find
it
humorous
that
they
label
it
a
dark
lager
on
the
bottle
its
true
but
it
seems
like
theyre
trying
to
get
macro
lager
drinkers
to
not
be
scared
of
it
drinkability
this
is
really
a
great
bock
and
much
better
then
i
expected
its
is
obvious
that
this
beer
was
made
to
drink
in
the
winter
but
its
good
enough
to
enjoy
year
round
i
will
definately
be
getting
some
more
of
this
and
you
should
do
the
same
drinkability
for
a
bock
this
is
very
drinkable
this
one
goes
great
on
a
cold
day
and
for
a
6
00
abv
its
pretty
easy
to
slug
down
a
good
job
to
saranac
on
this
one
ill
defintley
pick
these
up
this
winter
i
would
drink
a
few
of
these
and
i
reckon
these
are
best
right
out
of
the
tap
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color

carbonation

bodied

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
manchester
wine
and
liquors
manchester
ct
from
new
york
state
comes
this
hearty
bock
more
carbonated
than
some
beers
it
produced
a
good
creamy
head
hee
hee
when
poured
which
it
retained
well
fermented
with
a
lager
yeast
yet
the
aroma
is
distinctly
bock
sort
of
breadlike
and
you
can
taste
the
malted
character
up
front
followed
by
a
slightly
sweet
finish
a
little
bitter
probably
imparted
by
the
higher
alc
content
6
dark
copper
color
medium
bodied
not
as
dark
as
most
winter
beers
but
clearly
intended
to
be
drunk
during
those
months
this
beer
is
smooth
despite
the
evident
high
carbonation
maybe
a
little
burn
from
the
carbonation
in
the
end
good
mouthfeel
and
biggish
in
body
i
dont
see
whats
not
to
like
about
this
beer
i
could
easily
drink
another
but
im
in
no
hurry
to
finish
this
one
very
good
beer
i
got
this
item
at
wells
baltimore
for
3
996pack
which
is
a
pretty
decent
price
for
anything
good
these
days
pours
brownish
deep
gold
with
a
very
generous
foamy
head
which
may
be
an
age
related
characteristic
theres
a
very
pleasant
malty
aroma
somewhat
reminiscent
of
spent
grain
this
has
a
real
bock
taste
maybe
toward
a
dopple
in
its
profile
but
lighter
and
very
drinkable
it
seemed
heavier
and
sweeter
when
drunk
straight
from
the
bottle
its
pretty
well
balanced
right
through
the
lingering
finish
and
the
head
stuck
around
as
well
even
though
the
malty
flavor
and
slightly
sweet
tones
eased
up
in
time
they
may
put
this
beer
out
of
the
summer
beer
category
it
would
certainly
be
fine
on
a
cool
evening
for
the
price
an
excellent
beer
id
have
gotten
more
but
it
was
only
available
refrigerated
drinkability
very
another
nice
beer
from
f
x
matt
true
to
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
bock
beers
that
i
can
remember
having
good
job
and
i
recommend
d
a
good
offering
from
saranac
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
body
is
quite
nice
above
medium
chewy
and
creamy
one
of
the
few
saranac
brews
to
live
up
to
its
style
expectations
d
solid
offering
the
hop
context
to
this
bock
makes
it
a
keeper
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
and
thats
a
good
thing
because
i
just
bought
a
case
on
a
whim
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
bocks
are
near
the
bottom
of
my
most
favored
styles
list
that
said
i
think
im
able
to
give
all
beer
a
more
than
fair
shake
when
its
time
to
review
black
diamond
bock
is
one
of
this
brewerys
finest
creations
and
should
not
be
missed
by
fans
of
the
style
saranac
black
tan
is
very
good
too
thanks
and
greetings
from
b
inghamton
ny
d
honestly
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
saranac
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
bl
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
color
with
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
very
good
lacing
is
ok
it
smells
like
sweet
malt
caramel
and
bread
the
aroma
is
on
the
light
side
but
its
still
nice
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
hops
in
the
finish
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
but
with
above
average
carbonation
too
much
for
my
liking
drinkability
is
average
but
the
high
carbonation
doesnt
work
for
me
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
but
it
could
be
better
drinkability
nice
balance
would
buy
again
worth
a
try
easy
drinking
d
a
well
rounded
beer
with
a
flavor
that
im
describing
poorly
but
still
enjoying
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
in
my
opinion
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
is
just
a
tad
too
high
too
much
frittering
about
the
tongue
i
also
expected
this
brew
to
have
a
much
more
dense
body
its
finish
is
dry
leaving
the
mouth
water
for
more
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
well
with
early
spring
i
dont
know
if
id
come
back
to
it
i
think
that
i
am
much
more
of
a
doppelbock
guy
but
id
like
to
give
others
a
shot
before
i
do
or
dont
come
back
to
this
just
pretty
average
good
nothing
great
though
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
but
id
not
go
seeking
this
out
unless
you
are
a
huge
matt
brewing
fan
overall
impression
a
balanced
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
spring
bock
very
solid
and
should
be
brewed
all
the
time
recommended
md
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
weight
on
the
palate
with
a
creamy
disposition
carbonation
is
relatively
fine
and
light
but
works
very
well
with
the
brew
this
is
a
fairly
easy
drinking
lager
with
an
interesting
twist
as
a
bock
very
drinkable
great
beer
right
on
target
and
very
clean
im
diggin
this
beer
a
lot
to
hell
with
it
being
a
winter
seasonal
brew
it
year
round
a
typical
saranac
offering
very
good
but
a
bit
bland
in
comparison
to
the
world
class
breweries
initial
pour
was
a
pale
copper
color
with
about
34
inch
head
the
aroma
was
filled
with
caramel
and
moderate
alcohol
presence
initial
sip
was
surprising
moderate
cramel
maltiness
with
a
strong
alcohol
presence
but
very
smooth
the
finish
lingered
with
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
balanced
by
the
sweet
malt
the
alcohol
subsides
as
the
beer
warmed
with
a
decent
amount
of
lace
left
in
my
glass
all
in
all
a
decent
example
of
this
style
and
a
worthy
beer
d
drinkability
is
good
i
could
easily
have
several
more
of
these
i
woud
recommemd
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
decent
bock
a
decent
bock
beer
easy
to
drink
and
true
to
style
another
good
value
from
saranac
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
gorgeous
brown
color
in
the
glass
nice
head
retention
bright
hops
and
toasted
malt
in
the
nose
the
initial
taste
left
something
to
be
desired
however
the
alcohol
taste
was
just
a
bit
overpowering
the
balance
was
ok
but
rather
than
quietly
warm
you
as
you
drink
it
was
a
bit
in
your
face
all
the
way
down
i
know
im
a
lightweight
dont
get
me
wrong
for
the
style
it
was
worth
trying
but
not
quite
as
drinkableenjoyableas
i
had
hoped
when
i
picked
it
up
the
2008
version
of
black
diamond
bock
has
come
my
way
and
it
is
as
fresh
as
can
be
a
rich
caramel
malt
palate
is
balanced
by
expert
use
of
hops
although
i
read
of
this
being
one
dimensional
this
is
certainly
not
so
with
a
fresh
case
like
huber
bock
black
diamond
is
a
very
good
example
of
american
single
bock
beer
poured
into
a
large
pilsener
glass
i
can
think
of
nothing
to
complain
about
poured
1
12
bottles
into
a
5
liter
steina
nice
pour
a
clear
rich
copperbronze
with
a
tight
formed
one
finger
slight
off
white
head
that
settled
into
a
creamy
froth
sweet
caramel
and
bready
malt
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
irongrainy
medium
to
full
mouthfeel
it
coats
the
mouth
well
bready
and
grainy
husklike
flavors
up
front
with
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
but
its
quite
dry
with
not
alot
of
uniquness
to
it
kinda
bland
this
has
some
nice
things
about
itits
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
good
but
it
lacks
flavor
in
my
mind
d
very
drinkable
i
only
had
one
that
i
picked
up
at
shawan
on
the
singles
rack
otherwise
i
would
have
had
another
one
overall
a
good
late
winter
offering
from
saranac
they
could
have
made
it
a
bit
more
interesting
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
a
season
filled
with
barleywines

great
beer
for
the
cold
winter
months
good
overall
i
would
recommend
to
people
that
like
other
bocks
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
down
a
six
of
these
over
the
course
of
an
evening
a
good
beer
overall
but
nothing
outstanding
about
it
however
i
seem
to
enjoy
it
more
and
more
as
i
slowly
work
through
the
sixer
one
every
couple
days
good
interesting
overall
nice
to
see
an
american
made
standard
bock
and
would
love
to
see
more
d
much
better
than
i
expected
this
was
also
the
first
time
i
had
a
saranac
on
tap
and
not
from
the
bottle
saranac
seems
to
be
on
the
right
track
with
this
one
now
i
wish
they
would
just
redo
their
regular
pale
ale
d
overall
flavor
is
decent
and
non
offending
and
light
enough
to
make
for
a
decent
session
bock
not
a
fan
but
this
is
one
of
their
better
attempts
presumably
named
after
a
typical
skicourse
this
winter
selection
from
saranac
is
an
overall
pleasing
sample
that
didnt
disappoint
considered
a
bock
this
pours
a
dark
amber
copper
color
with
minimal
head
that
soon
dissipates
smell
is
very
malty
and
the
taste
is
complete
with
strong
rich
caramel
and
brown
sugar
flavors
with
a
maple
syrup
essence
good
stuff
overall
and
much
better
than
i
had
anticipated
copped
a
single
12oz
bottle
from
garys
in
madison
for

picture
of
a

with
ski
goggles
on
the
logo
behind
a
winter
scene
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
good
representation
of
the
style
with
a
thick
and
rich
malt
flavor
that
hits
home
certainly
a
good
winterstyle
brew
with
enough
flavor
and
character
to
warrant
a
sample
good
beer
recommended
drinkable
heck
yeah
its
very
reasonably
priced
its
6
abv
and
its
brewed
in
america
by
a
nonmacro
brewery
pretty
darn
good
a
little
sweet
and
full
but
thats
just
being
nitpicky
i
like
the
warmth
frm
the
alcohol
thats
something
you
dont
expect
from
such
a
lightlooking
beer
ive
got
to
ding
it
a
little
for
actually
being
a
little
too
low
in
abv
for
bjcp
standards
though
but
definitely
worth
buying
a
whole
sixer
of
has
a
lagery
wateryness
to
the
feel
it
thickens
as
it
warms
but
still
watery
though
smooth
its
a
decent
smooth
drinking
beer
with
a
hint
of
roasted
nutty
malt
not
bad
at
all
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
appearance
it
kinda
reminds
me
of
a
less
interesting
saranac
black
forest
i
wish
it
wasnt
so
one
dimensional
but
its
still
a
good
brew
overall
this
was
more
then
pleasant
and
was
actually
a
pleasurable
brew
to
enjoy
a
good
overall
session
or
dinner
brew
i
had
no
issues
with
it
at
all
now
it
was
not
anything
fancy
or
abnormally
special
in
any
way
just
a
good
solid
offering
i
would
definitely
not
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
my
way
again
unfortunately
they
really
do
not
ever
make
it
down
here
but
never
the
less
glad
i
could
try
it
and
look
forward
to
some
more
seasonals
from
saranac
overall
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
bock
like
nearly
all
saranac
beers
toward
the
shallow
end
of
the
style
but
very
enjoyable
nonetheless
notes
apparently
this
isnt
moving
all
that
well
i
think
i
paid
3
49
for
a
6pack
of
it
at
olivers
well
worth
it
at
that
price
and
frankly
i
think
this
may
be
one
of
my
higherrated
saranac
beers
solid
pours
a
dark
caramel
amber
color
with
w
shallow
light
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
generated
the
smell
is
on
the
timid
side
but
a
good
roasted
malt
medium
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
adequately
carbonated
and
there
is
a
slight
tingle
from
hops
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
mildly
roasted
a
smooth
bock
thats
a
nice
drinker
this
offering
from
saranac
pours
out
of
the
bottle
a
caramel
brown
leaving
a
thick
tan
head
that
stays
with
this
brew
the
aroma
is
brown
sugar
slight
sour
twinge
herbal
grassy
notes
very
faint
nose
the
taste
starts
sourtart
upfront
followed
by
a
small
caramel
maltiness
but
dominated
by
a
sour
feel
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
weak
and
watery
overall
subpar
beer
nothing
i
will
return
to
again
the
beer
poured
a
dark
clear
amber
color
in
the
pint
glass
with
about
one
half
inch
of
head
which
quickly
disappered
it
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
fruitmaybe
apple
or
raison
also
a
note
of
alcohol
tastes
sweet
and
malty
not
much
hop
taste
that
i
could
detect
some
alcohol
present
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
is
fairly
well
carbonated
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
more
than
other
saranac
brews
i
have
tried
i
would
definately
buy
more
especially
since
i
found
this
on
sale
for
14
99
for
a
case
drinkability
the
carbonation
lessened
the
drinkability
for
me
appears
with
a
copper
amber
body
and
forms
a
large
tan
head
leaves
behind
fine
lace
around
my
pint

evenly
strung
patterns
aromatics
have
mild
herbal
nobleesque
hops
roasty
caramel
nut
edge
and
sweetness
nothing
off
here
just
a
bit
subdued
overall
flavor
is
upfront
with
malt
sweetness
roasted
character
just
liquid
bread
right
touch
of
bitterness
from
the
herbal
hop
profile
but
they
really
dont
stand
out
overall
i
felt
the
flavors
were
just
muted
and
i
like
more
expressive
beer
than
this
one
has
to
offer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
a
touch
of
syrup
stickiness
with
even
carbonation
no
complaints
in
this
department
drinkability
is
decent
i
just
come
across
other
beers
id
rather
invest
my
time
in
this
one
was
just
ummm
okay
for
me
a
nice
dark
amber
to
copper
color
not
much
aroma
but
a
bit
of
bread
on
deep
inhalation
taste
is
very
much
on
style
with
bread
and
sweetish
malt
which
persists
through
the
finish
no
real
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
and
full
as
well
as
smooth
given
very
low
carbonation
you
dont
feel
the
6
abv
until
its
too
late
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
beers
from
saranac
and
at
a
price
point
which
you
cannot
beat
any
malt
heads
need
to
sample
this
one
cheers
drinkability
for
its
style
i
would
say
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
its
not
very
high
in
abv
and
tastes
pretty
delicious
not
a
bad
bock
at
6
99
a
sixpack
this
is
the
best
beer
going
right
now
this
beer
is
a
darker
amber
color
but
not
as
dark
as
i
expected
there
was
just
a
bit
of
head
on
the
top
that
quickly
disappeared
there
is
a
sweet
malty
aroma
that
comes
off
of
it
but
it
isnt
that
strong
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
flavor
initially
but
disappears
quickly
there
is
only
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
flavor
that
i
cant
place
but
reminds
me
of
a
steam
beer
it
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
has
decent
drinkability

black

and
toasted

it
pours
a
clear
deepcopper
body
with
glowing
amber
highlights
beneath
a
creamy
head
of
offwhite
that
holds
well
and
leaves
thin
sheets
of
spotty
lace
about
the
glass
the
malty
nose
offers
a
welcoming
caramelizedsugar
note
along
with
a
decent
amount
of
toastiness
backed
by
some
very
mild
hops
in
the
background
across
the
tongue
its
silky
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
veryfine
bubbled
moderate
carbonation
the
flavor
is
less
sweet
than
the
nose
suggests
although
the
almostscorched
sugardark
caramel
side
is
still
there
the
full
bitterness
tends
to
tone
it
down
it
becomes
toasty
and
somewhat
dry
across
the
middle
as
some
of
the
sugary
malt
fades
and
the
bitterness
rises
some
floral
and
leafy
hops
flitter
here
and
there
throughout
although
they
make
their
greatest
impression
in
the
dry
finish
unfortunately
some
alcohol
sneeks
in
there
as
well
which
is
odd
because
its
only
6
abv
still
its
pretty
well
contained
and
you
dont
really
notice
it
until
about
halfway
through
the
glass
overall
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
pored
to
a
rusty
clear
brown
color
with
a
nice
sized
off
white
to
tan
head
that
had
very
good
retention
and
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aromas
seem
to
highlight
a
good
deal
of
roasted
and
caramel
malts
that
stick
out
nicely
that
give
it
a
nice
roasted
and
nut
like
smell
it
is
nice
with
its
malts
up
front
giving
more
of
a
caramel
taste
along
with
a
nut
like
flavor
also
possibly
i
am
picking
up
a
fruit
like
taste
of
raisins
or
plums
has
a
crisp
and
dry
feel
to
it
over
all
i
enjoyed
this
brew
actually
would
like
to
see
this
in
it
mix
packs
as
i
feel
it
is
a
better
offering
than
a
number
of
them
nice
solid
run
of
the
mill
brew
from
saranac
based
on
it
style
good
drinkability
could
drink
a
few
would
get
bored
after
a
while
with
the
taste
a
bit
lacking
not
a
bad
beernot
one
of
the
better
ones
from
saranac
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
scen
that
boasts
of
crystal
malts
along
with
a
slightly
roasted
and
nutty
aroma
its
sweet
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
scent
the
taste
is
decent
its
quite
dry
with
a
roasted
feel
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
some
residual
sweetness
its
not
as
malty
as
it
smells
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
bock
beer
it
looks
and
smells
great
but
the
taste
lacks
a
bit
still
a
good
drinker
the
color
is
the
nice
amberishredbrown
that
you
would
expect
to
see
with
not
much
foam
at
all
the
smell
is
sweet
and
definitely
carries
the
scent
of
all
the
malt
which
i
personally
love
overall
taste
is
pretty
good
it
starts
off
much
the
way
it
smells
lots
of
malt
and
toffee
flavor
along
with
some
citrus
and
finishes
a
tad
on
the
bitter
side
though
its
still
good
mouthfeel
isnt
too
bad
maybe
a
little
too
much
carbonation
or
maybe
im
just
a
sissy
drinkability
is
pretty
high
in
fact
im
gonna
open
another
one
a
good
malty
brew
that
was
vey
good
with
beef
stew
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
small
head
smell
is
extremely
malty
and
inviting
taste
follows
the
smell
sweet
at
the
start
strong
malt
backbone
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
creamy
and
smooth
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
could
quaff
more
than
one
over
all
pretty
drinkable
and
nice
in
the
winter
months
worth
the
20
that
i
paid
for
it
worth
it
if
you
find
it
nothing
extra
special
about
this
beer
but
a
decent
offering
nonetheless
from
saranac
i
had
been
getting
away
from
the
as
of
late
but
i
am
hoping
that
they
give
me
reasons
to
spend
a
few
bucks
on
them
i
spent
a
bit
back
in
college
and
around
abouts
and
dont
mind
doing
it
as
long
as
they
step
up
a
bit
d
a
bock
its
a
nice
mix
of
the
best
ive
had
and
the
most
affordable
bocks
a
great
saranac
beer
cheers
this
bock
pours
a
maroon
tinged
amber
color
with
a
residual
cap
of
head
and
malt
toned
nose
with
hints
of
coffee
the
taste
does
feature
malt
to
spare
and
enough
hop
balance
to
avoid
being
one
dimensional
but
the
texture
robs
the
flavor
of
any
originality
or
true
character
due
to
its
thin
watery
finish
and
general
lack
of
backbone
it
kind
of
just
devolves
in
your
mouth
leaving
some
nasty
bitterness
and
not
much
else
maybe
its
the
water
but
saranac
never
could
deliver
the
mouthfeel
its
ambitions
demanded
oh
well
worth
trying
anyway
but
probably
not
much
more

bockin
it
up

thin
and
as
such
is
almost
swallowed
up
by
the

that
said
its
still
a
tastey
drinkable
brew
just
a
bit
off

was
that
ever
a
bad
thing
i
hope
not
this
is
very

even
though
it
is

got
this
one
out
of
a
bartenders
choice
bucket
at
hi5
in
raleigh
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
almost
bought
a
single
bottle
earlier
today
at
whole
foods
poured
a
deep
amber
color
with
minimal
head
that
was
quickly
diminishing
not
to
much
to
the
aroma
normal
malt
aroma
i
expect
from
a
bock
taste
wasnt
the
best
bock
ive
ever
had
but
still
good
not
too
much
carbonation
in
this
one
drinkable
but
i
dont
buy
bocks
that
often
not
sure
why
cause
i
do
really
enjoy
them
drinkability
somewhat
limited
and
not
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
sipping
some
more
malt
andor
complexity
would
fix
that
12oz
brown
botle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
clear
medium
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
and
ok
lace
definate
malt
aroma
mixed
with
caramel
and
an
odd
smell
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
almost
like
a
mix
of
alcohol
and
cigarettes
like
the
breath
of
someone
you
meet
in
a
bar
upon
tasting
is
initial
malts
weak
for
a
bock
mixed
with
a
peppery
higher
than
the
norm
hop
flavor
with
a
lingerinh
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
weak
for
a
bock
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
bocks
i
have
had
imho
skip
this
one
not
bad
at
all
12
ounce
bottle
o
3
00
if
you
poured
this
in
a
glass
and
didnt
tell
me
what
it
was
i
dont
think
id
pick
up
any
chocolate
flavor
it
is
subtle
even
when
i
am
looking
for
it
to
be
fair
this
is
a
beer
that
was
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
for
a
long
time
so
it
may
have
lost
someall
of
its
character
the
beer
is
pleasant
and
is
actually
nicer
as
it
warms
i
couldnt
see
myself
actually
buying
this
but
if
i
found
it
in
a
fridge
somewhere
id
probably
drink
it
again
i
wasnt
expecting
to
really
find
any
cocoa
nib
notes
in
this
beer
but
to
my
surprise
there
was
some
halfway
decent
flavors
the
feel
isnt
bad
but
is
a
little
tinny
as
a
tealike
leafiness
which
also
adds
some
dryness
comes
through
its
almost
mediumbodied
maybe
barely
with
a
steady
carbonation
and
even
moderate
crispness
in
short
it
tastes
like
the
bitter
coco
and
not
like
a
rich
chocolate
bottle

poured
a
clear
brown
amber
with
a
small
beige
head
aroma
and
taste
is
of
mildly
toasted
barley
malt
some
chocolate
notes
mild
bitterness
a
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
toasted
grains
some
light
chocolate
flavor
and
mild
bitterness
seems
a
bit
light
on
the
chocolate
flavor
needs
more
chocolate
overall
an
ok
sessional
brew
its
not
a
bad
drink
its
just
not
exciting
the
chocolate
is
certainly
there
but
its
still
just
a
hint
of
it
if
it
has
it
in
the
name
of
the
brew
i
would
expect
it
to
be
more
than
a
hint
this
is
rather
watery
looks
like
an
ale
and
has
far
too
little
chocolate
odd
advertisement
i
enjoyed
it
but
wouldnt
get
it
again
o
a
little
disappointing
given
the
claims
of
sinful
chocolate
otherwise
pleasant
for
what
it
is
if
im
buying
lagers
i
like
buying
nonstandard
lagers
and
this
could
definitely
be
one
of
them
has
a
medium
bodied
feel
with
a
slightly
benign
flavor
decent
beer
the
chocolate
is
honed
down
here
id
have
it
again
o
this
ones
kind
of
a
headscratcher
not
terrible
but
not
great
and
the
chocolate
is
almost
imperceptable
huh
the
taste
is
more
akin
to
a
sweet
caramel
malt
lager
than
chocolate
actually
vanilla
would
be
the
better
descriptor
there
is
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
at
the
tail
end
probably
my
least
favorite
selection
in
the
saranac
2013
winter
mix
pack
autumn
orange
in
color
with
good
clarity
poured
with
a
short
white
foam
that
quickly
disappeared
lightly
toasted
and
caramel
malt
aromas
with
chocolate
in
the
bacground
starts
off
a
bit
thin
but
quickly
evolves
into
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
tangy
robust
carbonation
caramel
and
dark
toasted
malt
flavors
up
front
quickly
followed
by
chocolate
flavors
that
grow
through
the
middle
tangy
hop
bite
from
start
through
the
middle
flavors
and
feel
take
a
smooth
turn
toward
the
end
finishes
with
a
toasted
malt
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
winter
beer
hazelnut
and
chocolate
flavor
great
mouthfeel
precisely
a
chocolate
lager
one
of
my
favorite
ive
had
for
the
past
three
years
if
you
like
sweet
beers
you
will
love
this
ive
always
been
happy
with
any
up
state
new
york
brew
o
a
decent
brew
id
definitely
drink
another
one
o
i
appreciate
that
this
one
holds
up
the
malt
character
expected
with
a
bock
but
the
combination
of
this
with
the
chocolate
seems
a
bit
unbalanced
its
worth
a
try
however
as
it
is
quite
different
wouldnt
put
it
anywhere
near
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
though
taste
seems
a
bit
watery
definitely
wishing
for
more
of
a
chocolate
presence
considering
the
sweet
caramel
malt
is
the
largest
aspect
of
this
beer
it
does
have
a
crisp
refreshing
carbonation
though
o
one
of
the
best
of
the
bunch
from
the
holiday
sampler
but
nothing
spectacular
a
little
too
safe
i
wish
saranac
would
take
a
few
more
chances
with
their
brews
if
they
were
just
a
little
more
daring
they
might
fare
better
iid
cheers
o
i
had
expected
a
bit
more
maltiness
to
compete
with
the
cocoa
but
other
then
that
the
bitterness
and
the
dry
finish
are
pleasant
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
not
outstanding
but
nice
in
an
average
kind
of
way
the
style
says
bock
i
say
its
a
very
drinkable
dunkel
but
as
a
bock
it
is
underwhelming
as
a
dunkel
it
is
a
nice
average
sample
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
solid
beer
probably
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
again
but
i
enjoyed
the
experience
c
overall
having
this
after
samuel
smiths
chocolate
stout
was
maybe
not
fair
but
this
really
lacked
the
flavor
profile
i
was
looking
for
the
lager
yeast
presumabley
scrapped
much
of
the
sweet
flavor
out
of
this
beer
leaving
a
more
clean
balanced
flavor
profile
but
maybe
just
the
chocolate
and
lager
combo
arent
a
match
you
see
too
often
for
a
reason
sell
this
beer
as
a
dunkel
and
im
all
aboard
its
satisfactory
and
appealing
with
nuances
of
complexity
that
is
unexpected
yet
rewarding
but
as
a
selfsold
chocolate
infused
bockbier
my
mind
is
set
on
higher
expectations
ok
so
right
off
the
bat
in
case
anyone
reading
this
wondering
this
beer
is
nothing
like
the
sicklysweet
caramel
porter
no
there
isnt
a
big
chocolate
taste
but
this
is
a
decent
bock
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
a
dry
cocoa
comes
out
in
the
aroma
and
theres
a
light
earthy
note
in
the
flavors
finish
of
course
theres
also
a
big
caramel
toffee
and
toasted
bread
crust
barley
character
its
less
fruity
than
your
average
bock
but
i
like
the
cocoa
replacing
the
usual
sugars
the
body
is
on
par
with
your
average
lager
making
it
fairly
drinkable
this
is
kind
of
a
cool
beer
balanced
chocolate
tasty
malts
and
a
slightly
bitter
hops
finish
id
take
another
overall
its
okay
really
im
just
pleased
its
not
obnoxiously
sweet
or
eyerollingly
artificial
tasting
overall
an
all
around
average
beer
and
i
really
with
the
chocolate
was
a
little
more
pronounced
not
quite
as
good
as
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
but
nonoffensive
nonetheless
this
is
a
creative
well
made
lager
that
is
nice
for
a
holiday
variety
pack
its
a
change
of
pace
to
try
and
talk
about
at
holiday
gatherings
probably
not
anything
you
would
seek
out
on
its
own
but
to
have
during
a
session
not
a
bad
mouthfeel
but
ill
end
up
feeding
the
second
one
to
an
in
law
come
christmas
the
pour
created
two
fingers
of
fragile
tawny
head
that
fell
like
a
souffle
in
an
oven
whose
door
had
just
been
banged
shut
it
left
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
though
so
for
that
cheers
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
neplus
quality
clarity
enabling
me
to
see
both
through
walls
and
into
the
future
nose
was
chocolate
but
a
different
chocolate
than
the
atwater
that
i
reviewed
earlier
this
seemed
somehow
more
authentic
like
raw
unprocessed
chocolate
nice
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
not
as
dense
as
atwater
voodoovator
but
still
pretty
massive
in
the
mouth
i
am
really
glad
that
i
drank
this
shortly
after
the
atwater
dark
chocolate
as
it
gives
me
a
greater
appreciation
for
saranacs
craft
it
was
chocolaty
but
subtly
so
the
chocolate
had
an
unprocessed
taste
as
though
the
nibs
were
added
almost
as
an
afterthought
the
finish
was
dry
believe
me
or
dont
this
is
going
to
disappoint
a
lot
of
people
who
may
be
expecting
a
liquid
chocolate
bar
but
for
those
of
us
who
do
not
dig
that
sort
of
thing
this
was
perfect
o
the
light
and
airy
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
prevents
it
from
feeling
heavy
12

this
was
the

from
the

i
could
finish
o
a
likeable
lager
make
this
available
in
a
6pack
overall
a
tasty
malt
driven
lager
overall
an
enjoyable
and
drinkable
winter
beer
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes

is
a
crystal
clear

beer
topped
with
a
sand
colored
waxy
foam
that
has
very
good
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
metallic
aroma
with
a
hint
of
grass
and
chocolate
its
medium
bodied
a
little
watery
with
a
slightly
chalky
finish
its
just
a
touch
sweet
and
amply
bitter
something
about
it
seems
kind
of
salty
the
chocolate
fills
the
middle
of
the
taste
without
much
subtlety
it
gets
more
bitter
toward
the
end
with
notes
of
wood
resin
and
metal
well
im
glad
theres
chocolate
in
there
i
dont
think
this
beer
would
stand
up
without
it
it
isnt
great
but
it
isnt
bad
o
not
bad
as
for
readily
available
winter
chocolate
beers
if
presented
with
this
and
a
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
id
go
with
the
sam
good
backup
and
not
a
bad
intro
to
chocolatey
beers
this
beer
blows
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
out
of
the
water
the
use
of
chocolate
in
the
profile
and
the
nicely
masked
6
abv
are
just
couple
of
reasons
i
would
prefer
this
over
its
sam
adams
counterpart
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
clear
looking
brown
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
minimal
not
too
much
chocolate
on
the
nose
but
some
lagerlike
aromas
the
taste
has
a
pretty
good
amount
of
chocolate
actually
it
kind
of
tastes
a
little
artificial
to
me
but
still
better
than
i
expected
from
this
company
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
rather
smooth
and
was
very
drinkable
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
i
never
expected
what
i
got
im
actually
kind
of
glad
i
have
one
more
bottle
to
open
later
this
was
ahuge
surprise
especially
when
it
didnt
pour
black
it
seems
that
the
chocolate
really
compliment
with
the
typical
saranac
flavor
malty
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew

would
not
hestitate

chocolate
up

this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
great
flavor
but
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
as
well
as
it
could
with
a
little
more
harmony
this
would
be
truly
great
taste
is
much
better
as
some
of
the
sweetness
comes
out
and
the
chocolate
is
light
smooth
and
tastefully
done
not
bad
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
being
little
more
than
the
consistency
of
water
though
i
enjoyed
trying
this
once
but
its
certainly
onedimensional
and
i
dont
really
think
id
want
a
whole
sixer
of
this
in
the
fridge
although
on
the
other
hand
this
is
probably
the
best
one
of
the
winter
mix
12pack
my
dad
brought
back
from
d
c
this
pack
was
my
first
taste
of
the
saranac
family
and
i
am
pretty
disappointed
with
all
6
i
have
tried
thus
far
o
a
lot
of
chocolate
beers
have
an
overpowering
chocolate
taste
that
dominates
the
beer
this
however
is
definitely
not
one
of
those
the
chocolate
taste
is
more
of
an
aftertaste
i
would
have
liked
it
to
come
out
a
little
bit
more
but
it
wasnt
bad
it
was
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
had
to
try
this
week
not
bad
but
definitely
could
have
been
better
taste
begins
sweet
lightly
chalky
chocolate
in
the
middle
which
carries
on
through
to
the
end
with
a
light
bitterness
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
nice
to
see
a
flavored
brew
from
saranac
that
isnt
overpoweringly
artificial
like
some
ive
had
easy
drinking
but
nothing
exciting
decent
i
could
go
for
this
sometimes
but
only
if
i
wasnt
looking
for
something
interesting
pours
a
clear
ruddy
brown
body
with
a
nice
beige
head
the
head
lasts
a
decent
time
and
laces
the
glass
nicely
aroma
was
malty
sweet
and
light
taste
is
very
appealing
the
chocolate
is
not
at
all
overpoweringbut
definately
present
very
slightly
slick
d
i
can
get
behind
what
this
beer
is
trying
to
do
its
an
inspired
and
different
take
on
the
style
though
im
pretty
sure
this
isnt
a
bock
but
its
poorly
executed
good
mouthfeel
crisp
mediumhigh
carbonation
that
falls
just
shy
of
being
prickly
body
isnt
too
thin
and
everything
feels
right
for
a
lagerstyle
beer
not
bad
dont
go
into
this
one
expecting
a
big
chocolate
presence
however
overall
i
think
saranac
made
a
nice
beer
here
that
is
quite
sessionable
enjoy
sorry
i
dont
recommend
this
one
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
the
flavor
could
use
some
balance
and
the
sweetness
is
a
little
too
much
at
times
but
overall
its
drinkable
and
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
iced
tea
color
with
a
2
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
random
small
streaks
of
lace
stick
to
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
subtle
chocolate
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
artificial
chocolate
flavoring
and
some
herbalcitrus
zest
hops
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
doesnt
live
up
to
the
chocolate
flavors
i
was
expecting
o
not
the
beer
i
was
expecting
but
not
a
horrible
beer
there
are
way
better
choices
but
if
it
is
there
and
there
are
no
other
good
choices
i
might
get
it
i
had
very
high
hopes
for
this
beer
as
well
see
my
review
on
the
saranac
vanilla
stout
i
bought
a
cold
12
pack
of
the
12
beers
of
christmas
and
there
were
2
of
these
chocolate
lagers
included
i
poured
yet
another
wasted
frosty
mug
full
and
again
another
big
fat
flop
it
was
pretty
much
bland
overall
not
even
a
hint
of
chocolate
this
one
too
fell
short
and
flat
of
my
expectations
even
for
a
plain
lager
very
lackluster
and
blah
again
save
your
money
for
a
real
craft
brew
amen
and
testify
i
poured
this
average
tasting
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
copper
colored
and
light
for
its
name
i
thought
it
poured
a
fair
head
the
smell
was
malty
the
taste
on
this
beer
was
weak
i
tasted
no
chocolate
ate
all
and
actually
more
of
a
vanilla
taste
than
anything
i
did
not
think
it
well
represented
itself
as
to
what
is
was
suppose
to
be
not
buy
again
o
quite
an
intriguing
beer
i
liked
the
flavours
another
winner
from
the
mix
pack
overall
an
interesting
brew
the
chocolate
flavor
works
well
and
pretty
solid
bock
backbone
funny
if
you
blindfolded
me
and
gave
me
this
beer
i
would
guess
that
i
was
drinking
a
sam
adams
chocolate
bock
there
is
an
unmistakable
raisin
bran
flavor
that
is
very
pronounced
in
both
of
these
beers
its
not
bad
but
not
what
youd
expect
from
a
supposed
chocolate
beer
although
it
kind
of
grows
on
you
just
average
stuff
one
bottle
is
enough
the
taste
has
more
obvious
chocolate
and
toasted
note
along
with
a
slight
nutty
flavor
a
little
sweet
in
the
finish
this
bock
is
still
relatively
smooth
and
light
for
the
style
not
something
to
write
home
about
but
this
goes
down
fairly
easy
overall
a
good
beer
definitely
will
pick
up
a
few
singles
to
have
lying
around
if
not
another
saranac
winter
variety
pack
as
the
whole
sampling
is
spot
on
not
very
bockish
more
of
an
amber
lager
and
the
chocolate
is
light
an
ok
beer
drinks
fairly
well
o
i
think
this
is
more
of
a
lager
than
a
bock
it
would
have
a
larger
body
if
it
were
a
bock
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
most
of
the
others
in
the
variety
pack
o
this
is
a
nice
chocolate
lager
another
solid
brew
from
saranac
a
very
very
interesting
lager
pours
a
see
through
amber
color
with
the
tint
of
milk
chocolate
and
a
lasting
frothy
mocha
head
smells
like
a
brownie
a
malt
brownie
brimming
with
a
pleasant
chocolate
aroma
akin
to
hot
cocoa
in
a
beer
taste
is
more
bitter
than
sweet
chocolate
although
the
malts
lend
a
sugar
component
this
is
a
lager
which
is
unique
for
sure
it
somehow
stays
crisp
and
drinkable
a
great
new
addition
to
the
beers
of
winter
od
saranac
has
made
a
really
solid
chocolate
bock
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
touch
artificial
tasting
but
its
a
tasty
offering
in
the
12
pack
balances
out
the
hoppy
offerings
