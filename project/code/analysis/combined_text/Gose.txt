loved
the
earthiness
and
tang
of
the
rhubarb
with
this
one
hopefully
have
a
chance
to
find
this
one
again
a
gem
awesomely
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
nice
red
fruity
flavor
imparted
by
the
rhubarb
need
more
gose
beers
in
my
life
this
is
a
delicious
beer
the
rhubarb
lends
a
surprising
complexity
of
fruit
aromas
and
taste
not
traditional
but
well
done
nice
citrusy
smell
lightly
sour
subtly
herbal
taste
super
refreshing
super
light
the
rhubarb
doesnt
seem
to
be
coming
through
in
the
taste
but
seems
to
make
the
beer
very
wonderful
great
brew
serving
type
bottle
bottle
pours
a
opaque
golden

the
color
is
interesting
as
is
the
aroma
it
smells
slightly
cheesy
with
some
unripe
fruits
lemon
aroma
as
well
reminds
me
of
kiwis
too
the
flavor
is
sharp
and

actually
starts
to
sneak
up
on
me
the
more
i
enjoy
this
brew
light
bodied
surprisingly
high
carbonation
savory
yet
crisp
dry
very
interesting
very
rustic
and
fruity
a
tasty
unique
gose
complete
dryness
is
strongly
committed
to
the
lactic
acidity
and
its
clean
citrusy
portrayal
while
the
ale
effortlessly
strips
the
palate
of
all
thirst
and
leaves
it
refreshed
an
aftertaste
of
musty
cork
and
light
bread
keeps
the
palate
rewarded
both
deep
and
quick
this
is
a
gose
transcends
the
style
in
my
opinion
and
i
will
be
so
frustrated
if
they
dont
just
up
and
decide
to
make
this
a
yearround
offering
highly
drinkable
refreshing
complex
and
rivals
even
several
high
quality
german
rieslings
ive
had
to
date
do
everything
possible
to
try
this
its
delicious
complex
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
new
staple
for
the
style
if
i
ever
saw
one
a
seemingly
odd
combination
of
rauchbier
and
berliner
weisse
but
it
works
fairly
well
tart
and
smokey
elements
mix
together
well
thanks
to
a
restrained
use
of
smoked
grains
time
for
other
brewers
to
revive
this
old
style
brew
ointeresting
smoked
weisse
beer
okay
and
i
would
drink
more
but
seek
out
as
must
have
complex
flavor
and
aroma
brings
enjoyment
when
rating
this
beer
bottle
at
redlight
redlight
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
orange
with
a
good
amount
of
tight
white
head
that
held
about
30
seconds
before
fading
into
a
thin
collar
good
lacing
a
weird
kind
of
funk
to
the
aroma
of
this
beer
almost
like
a
spoiled
cheese
i
also
get
some
orangey
citrus
and
dry
grass
taste
is
very
similar
the
citrus
up
front
the
grass
in
the
middle
and
the
bleu
cheese
funk
throughout
nice
carbonation
medium
to
high
and
a
nice
mediumlight
body
mouth
mild
creamy
med
bod
nice
fluffy
carb
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
hefe
glass
looks
like
a
normal
wheat
beer
aroma
is
light
and
not
as
smoky
as
expected
the
flavor
though
is
very
unique
the
sourness
hits
your
first
then
the
smokiness
lingers
on
your
palate
after
you
swallow
very
smooth
and
clean
beer
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
love
the
intermingling
of
smoke
and
sour
one
of
my
new
favorite
styles
pours
from
the
bottle
cloudy
grainy
hazy
golden
with
a
one
finger
white
head
aroma
is
weird
smokey
wheat
and
spice
yeast
funk
flavor
is
fruited
smoked
bacon
apple
hint
of
yeast
and
spice
a
smoked
brew
for
sure
light
medium
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
lingering
smoke
this
is
weird
not
bad
but
a
strange
combo
of
light
weisse
and
dark
smoke
i
think
my
love
affair
with
smoked
beers
is
increasing
but
its
definitely
not
the
most
practical
option
if
its
something
i
want
to
sip
on
for
a
good
long
while
on
the
other
hand
im
so
glad
to
finally
try
a
much
better
take
on
a
grodziskie
and
this
would
pair
marvelously
with
food
really
good
stuff
but
not
as
drinkable
as
id
like
it
to
be
fans
of
smoked
beers
must
try
this
one
cloudy
yellow
very
little
head
and
light
carbonation
unexpected
smokiness
on
such
a
light
beer
smoke
and
wheat
dominate
along
with
funk
not
much
on
the
nose
i
like
the
flavors
but
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
the
way
it
coats
my
tongue
mild
but
long
lingering
aftertaste
the
flavor
is
lightly
smoked
with
a
wheaty
smoothness
the
tartness
is
dialed
downnot
a
berliner
weiss
sort
of
tartness
with
a
sweetness
on
the
finish
light
refreshing
with
that
great
whisper
of
smoke
keeping
it
interesting
o
a
well
made
easy
to
like
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
i
never
expected
a
sour
rauchbier
to
work
but
oddly
this
one
does
one
i
will
certainly
have
again
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
to
light
level
of
carbonation
the
smoke
verse
tart
lemony
quality
certainly
makes
for
an
interesting
experience
however
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
the
alcohol
is
seemingly
nonexistent
and
it
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
for
someone
who
likes
both
smoked
brews
and
berliner
weisse
this
really
was
enjoyable
with
a
pleasant
balance
i
wouldnt
change
anything
about
this
brew
except
for
maybe
its
availability
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
have
this
again
without
having
to
bother
someone
from
germany
to
send
me
some
d
i
love
berliners
and
this
is
quite
a
good
one
though
the
smoked
berliner
concept
sounded
crazy
it
has
only
a
modicum
of
smoke
character
d
and
overall
impression
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
on
this
one
overall
a
great
berliner
and
one
that
i
could
crush
on
a
hot
summer
day
skal
the
initial
lemony
sourness
never
gets
overpowering
and
is
quickly
replaced
by
unobtrusive
smoked
malt
flavor
i
couldnt
tell
whether
the
sourness
was
derived
from
usage
of
lactobacteria
or
simply
by
mixing
the
malt
with
hot
water
and
sustaining
the
temperature
long
enough
to
allow
the
lemony
sourness
to
develope
from
yeast
action
but
the
individual
flavors
are
clean
and
easily
pinpointed
at
the
smoky
character
is
of
burnt
wood
without
heavy
fleshy
flavors
of
bacon
or
fat
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
and
refreshing
with
excellent
drinkability
abraxas
is
a
a
kind
of
hybrid
between
berliener
weisse
and
rauchbier
successfully
seeking
balance
between
smoke
and
sour
overall
reminded
me
of
a
cross
between
a
berliner
weisse
25
and
an
apple
cider
beer
75
definitely
hits
the
spot
on
this
warm
spring
evening
my
only
gripe
is
that
it
could
have
used
a
lot
more
carbonation
definitely
a
solid
session
beer
the
3
8
abv
was
a
shock
felt
a
lot
stronger
and
fuller
than
that
very
drinkable
a
little
more
salty
than
sour
overall
mild
and
refreshing
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
regular
hefeweizen
glass
cloudy
once
i
poured
the
yeast
into
the
beer
the
head
is
white
and
thick
the
smell
is
grassy
not
what
i
expected
from
a
spruced
gose
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
is
just
what
expect
and
great
its
got
the
saltiness
i
expect
and
a
little
something
extra
which
i
think
is
the
spruce
overall
a
good
beer
moderately
tart
not
tart
not
salty
not
tasty
o
very
easy
to
drink
since
both
the
sourness
and
the
brininess
of
this
beer
are
not
as
intense
as
some
of
the
others
in
the
style
sessionable
and
it
would
be
excellent
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
very
smooth
for
a
gose
i
got
some
stone
fruit
flavors
to
accompany
the
sourness
very
refreshing
poured
into
my
teku
glass
sweet
for
a
gose
and
slightly
bready
like
a
kolsch
not
very
sour
however
certainly
light
and
refreshing
this
zippy
lighthoney
colored
offering
is
quite
literally
bursting
with
a
fragrant
layering
of
peach
mango
and
spring
flowers
focused
and
refined
where
the
residual
sweetness
is
playing
off
the
lemony
tartness
and
traditional
salinity
refreshing
and
elegant
overall
even
if
rather
hollow
and
short
its
refreshing
in
a
weird
way
but
its
not
like
a
kolsch
or
helles
lager
on
a
hot
day
different
to
say
the
least
taste
slightly
thin
sour
salty
a
little
more
carbonation
than
usual
reeks
of
bready
malt
but
luckily
theres
some
lime
and
sharp
peach
and
grapefruit
in
the
flavor
to
add
complexity
floral
notes
are
a
nice
complement
and
with
its
dry
and
racy
finish
the
palate
is
left
refreshed
and
the
thirst
is
quenched
to
near
perfection
just
enough
acidity
to
wash
the
palate
it
trails
with
a
soft
mineral
quality
and
faint
citrus
peel
much
like
ginandtonic
refreshers
echoes
of
wheat
return
deep
in
aftertaste
othis
beer
is
a
relatively
traditional
and
simple
example
of
the
style
it
drinks
easy
and
doesnt
blow
you
away
with
tartness
or
salt
or
whatever
it
fits
the
bill
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
there
are
better
gose
beers
out
there
o
not
a
bad
gose
but
i
have
had
better
worth
trying
might
pock
up
again
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
particularly
great
example
of
a
style
thats
really
starting
to
catch
on
worth
a
try
but
it
wouldnt
be
a
goto
beer
for
me
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
dense
white
head
settles
to
a
thin
layer
sheet
of
lace
for
a
few
inches
down
the
glass
smell
grape
juice
spice
wheat
cracker
citrus
and
earthy
notes
somewhat
fruity
but
no
real
promise
of
acid
taste
interesting
some
fruit
sweetness
nectarine
grape
into
pine
and
citrus
into
snappy
lactic
wheat
spice
then
finishing
semidry
with
residual
lemon
a
little
salt
and
lingering
herbal
note
not
as
summertimecrushable
as
others
but
this
one
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
nice
overall
a
pretty
good
gose
the
spruce
is
subtle
but
a
nice
touch
this
beers
very
interesting
to
me
i
find
it
enjoyable
but
just
like
the
sour
wheat
ale
i
had
recently
not
sour
to
the
american
tongue
there
are
a
medley
of
flavors
within
and
i
enjoy
them
but
i
do
find
that
this
beer
to
closely
resembles
a
hefeweizen
rather
than
boldly
proclaiming
itself
a
gose
i
suppose
id
like
a
little
more
explosiveness
from
the
salt
and
spices
typical
american
overall
the
spruce
flavor
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
and
almost
seems
to
hold
back
this
beer
from
being
great
for
5
i
cant
complain
the
flavor
has
a
pleasing
minerality
some
coriander
and
a
hint
of
wheat
collaborate
with
juniper
berries
crisp
and
slightly
tart
i
like
it
a
twist
on
the
style
with
the
spruce
nettles
the
nose
on
this
gives
such
an
interesting
perfume
that
you
think
you
are
tasting
something
that
you
are
not
my
first
gose
bottle
to
tulip
cloudy
straw
yellow
pour
with
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
straw
honey
sweet
malts
tart
banana
flavor
is
a
pilsner
and
hefe
combo
with
clove
banana
citrus
honey
flavors
dont
get
a
whole
lot
from
the
spruce
though
i
dont
know
what
the
base
flavor
of
the
style
tastes
like
slight
yeast
funk
and
clean
finish
high
carbonation
with
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
not
bad
and
easy
to
drink
i
believe
i
had
this
on
tap
many
months
ago
but
i
remember
being
enamored
with
the
bright
woody
tree
sap
like
flavors
that
came
with
the
funk
i
really
hope
to
find
more
goses
made
like
this
its
simultaneously
crisp
and
light
enough
to
drink
but
the
flavor
is
really
complex
and
all
over
the
place
in
comparison
to
your
everyday
beer
or
hell
your
everyday
sour
happy
with
what
this
brewery
is
doing
with
old
nearly
forgotten
german
styles
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
they
do
well
and
differently
o
a
nice
tasting
beer
theres
only
a
bit
of
spruce
in
the
nose
and
the
acidity
could
be
upped
a
bit
tasty
one
of
those
beers
that
would
be
excellent
in
a
6
pack
on
a
hot
summer
night
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
resulting
in
a
lightly
effervescent
mouthfeel
that
settles
in
appropriate
time
to
a
slightly
heavier
smoother
lightly
foamy
mouthfeel
that
seems
appropriate
for
the
style
o
a
refreshing
summer
beer
i
didnt
pick
up
any
notes
of
spruce
so
i
will
fly
to
germany
and
demand
a
refund
this
gose
pours
a
very
pale
orange
semitransparent
at
first
but
then
turns
cloudy
from
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
starts
out
with
a
nice
big
white
head
about
three
fingers
worth
no
lacing
but
good
retention
all
the
way
down
smells
of
lemon
hay
coriander
and
just
a
little
bit
funky
overall
not
much
aroma
its
funky
when
it
first
goes
in
the
mouth
doesnt
come
across
as
tart
but
theres
definitely
an
acidic
quality
to
it
theres
lemon
orange
more
coriander
just
a
hint
of
salt
and
no
bitterness
at
all
as
the
beer
warms
the
coniferous
notes
come
to
life
and
reminds
me
of
a
mountain
forest
which
is
amazing
this
gose
drinks
very
easily
and
is
a
refreshing
beer
its
pretty
unique
but
good
for
anytime
of
the
year
smooth
feel
lightly
astringent
though
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
tart
very
mild
coriander
supple
wheat
light
apple
ester
from
the
yeast
creamy
and
light
bodied
light
papery
oxidation
note
not
too
distracting
this
seems
very
traditional
simple
but
easy
to
drink
not
especially
tart
or
salty
though
and
not
picking
up
much
if
any
spruce
in
this
bottle
o
overall
let
down
by
this
one
was
expecting
more
pine
or
spruce
mostly
just
sour
wheat
overall
very
bland
and
simple
i
cant
get
a
feel
for
this
genre
i
always
expect
them
to
be
more
tart
whereas
this
one
is
very
mild
d
not
bad
it
is
less
tart
than
i
expected
and
the
spruce
is
also
fairly
light
drinkable
but
im
not
all
that
excited
by
it
b
o
gose
is
not
a
style
im
very
familiar
with
and
i
dont
think
im
alone
in
this
this
is
just
the
third
or
fourth
example
of
the
style
ive
had
it
shows
more
restraint
in
both
saltiness
and
tartness
than
others
but
this
is
a
good
thing
as
it
allows
for
more
complexity
to
come
through
and
ramps
up
the
drinkability
the
spruce
is
very
subtle
and
i
like
it
in
this
role
it
really
isnt
the
oddity
i
was
expecting
thought
the
rarity
of
the
style
makes
it
a
bit
of
an
eccentricity
already
its
tough
to
rate
to
style
when
the
style
is
this
rare
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
from
what
i
can
tell
it
is
a
wellmade
balanced
beer
a
real
oddity
here
a
spruced
gose
possible
the
lightest
colored
and
flavored
beer
ever
it
pours
almost
perfectly
clear
lighter
than
a
berliner
with
a
couple
inches
of
white
head
its
so
clear
i
can
watch
tv
through
it
unabated
the
nose
is
light
as
anything
a
touch
of
wheat
malt
and
minerals
not
spruce
at
all
the
flavor
has
a
slight
lemon
kick
to
it
and
is
fairly
dialed
down
on
the
salt
content
compared
to
some
other
german
gose
beers
ive
had
he
privilege
of
trying
the
wheat
malt
appears
to
be
cut
with
water
in
a
50
percent
mix
and
i
only
get
a
little
spruce
when
i
really
focus
maybe
its
a
mind
game
and
its
not
there
at
all
maybe
im
tasting
what
i
want
to
taste
who
knows
this
beer
is
so
light
on
flavor
its
impossible
to
tell
although
i
dont
dislike
it
at
all
ultra
light
feel
too
much
so
really
but
it
is
refreshing
for
the
style
since
there
isnt
too
much
salt
in
the
finish
drying
me
out
carbonation
is
ample
overall
a
beer
that
just
didnt
have
a
lot
of
flavor
to
it
a
stronger
or
more
concentrated
version
would
be
welcomed
here
probably
good
with
a
salad
or
grilled
veggies
overall
not
bad
not
exceptional
a
little
odd
and
im
not
sure
whether
or
not
its
better
for
it
sweet
and
tart
by
equal
proportions
very
smooth
beerseems
to
have
an
abundance
of
wheat
soft
on
the
palate
but
not
exactly
rich
high
level
of
carbonation
i
do
not
detect
any
spruce
by
now
ive
had
several
goses
but
this
may
be
the
first
one
ive
had
that
is
actually
german
served
in
a
ommegang
chalice
this
was
one
attractive
beer
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
small
but
thick
layer
of
white
head
that
retained
until
the
end
and
left
some
streaks
of
lacing
on
the
glass
when
swirled
aroma
was
a
bit
muted
notes
of
toasted
wheat
and
light
citrus
taste
of
salted
sourdough
bread
lemon
pith
slightly
lactic
probably
wouldnt
have
stood
up
great
on
its
own
but
paired
with
some
authentic
kartoffelpuffer
it
was
drinking
just
fine
smooth
mouthfeel
lightmedium
body
soft
carbonation
quite
good
overall
o
on
the
sweeter
style
for
a
gose
but
its
certainly
good
this
is
a
style
ive
found
a
lot
more
examples
recently
and
for
that
i
am
quite
thankful
o
this
beer
is
quite
quaffable
its
neither
very
sour
nor
salty
so
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
drinkability
is
high
a
refreshing
balanced
mild
gose
this
is
made
to
quench
not
to
ponder
cranking
up
the
lacto
and
salt
might
be
more
exciting
but
not
nearly
as
drinkable
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
extreme
but
it
is
nevertheless
very
well
done
overall
this
is
an
incredibly
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
i
think
it
takes
all
the
ingredients
and
does
them
all
justice
by
not
making
any
of
them
more
bold
than
another
i
think
i
would
prefer
it
more
tart
but
that
being
said
i
have
not
had
a
gose
that
really
nails
it
with
the
salt
and
cardamom
this
spruced
gose
pours
a
light
bodied
and
cloudy
light
gold
in
color
with
a
two
finger
bright
white
head
the
nose
is
light
with
moderate
german
yeast
character
light
lemon
peel
and
a
touch
of
spruce
the
flavors
mimic
the
nose
with
light
and
slowly
acidic
lemon
peel
with
nice
and
approachable
german
yeast
and
a
slight
sprucementhol
character
that
shows
its
head
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
just
a
touch
of
salt
but
nothing
over
the
top
its
like
drinking
a
light
hefe
on
the
beach
in
florida
the
spruce
isnt
bold
but
its
there
in
the
finish
it
drinks
light
in
body
and
is
very
sessionable
this
would
make
for
a
great
german
session
beer
for
summer
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
gose
ive
had
yet
its
a
really
nice
beer
for
the
style
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruit
and
some
perfumelike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
salty
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
to
me
it
tastes
like
a
glass
of
water
with
a
splash
of
beer
and
a
tsp
of
salt
certainly
not
worth
the
for
me
its
a
real
interesting
beer
but
it
comes
off
just
surprisingly
too
fruity
for
my
tastes
and
also
has
a
radler
quality
to
it
it
is
however
a
very
good
beer
but
not
usually
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
i
would
however
recommend
this
though
for
fans
of
the
style
to
give
it
a
go
othis
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
it
manages
to
pack
a
fair
bit
of
flavor
into
a
low
abv
package
without
tasting
gimmicky
or
tarted
up
it
is
more
aggressive
than
classic
german
gose
but
less
salty
than
many
popular
examples
of
the
style
e
g
westbrook
i
actually
like
it
this
way
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
summer
afternoon
without
any
problem
my
only
knock
would
be
the
price
this
guy
is
a
bit
spendy
to
drink
in
volume
refreshing
light
sour
ale
easy
drinking
on
a
late
summer
afternoon
at
the
cottage
there
are
no
fitter
descriptors
than
balanced
and
delicate
with
nice
coriander
herbal
dill
and
citric
notes
abound
the
palate
the
real
challenge
in
gosebrewing
is
involving
and
expertly
achieved
the
balance
between
the
salinity
acidity
abv
and
sourness
make
this
a
memorable
quencher
and
really
set
this
one
apart
at
the
tongue
the
aromatics
are
restrained
but
fair
and
fitting
overall
one
of
the
better
gose
beers
i
have
ever
had
its
so
bright
and
herbal
with
notes
of
green
tea
sweet
lemon
balm
coriander
seed
lime
leaf
and
something
more
floral
even
hibiscus
or
something
its
complex
but
its
clean
minimally
tart
for
the
style
just
very
light
and
drinkable
the
salt
here
is
nice
too
gives
the
beer
some
body
and
a
nice
mineral
character
with
an
abv
this
low
too
its
one
i
can
drink
plenty
of
and
for
what
it
is
the
price
isnt
bad
at
all
i
am
surprised
to
look
and
see
i
havent
had
any
beers
from
these
guys
before
i
see
their
stuff
around
periodically
but
have
always
been
turned
off
by
high
prices
this
one
is
really
really
fair
the
flavors
here
are
as
bright
and
summery
and
herbaceous
as
i
have
seen
in
the
style
carbonation
is
fantastic
and
the
wheat
malt
base
is
very
flavorful
exceptional
example
of
the
style
a
nice
little
twist
of
being
different
in
here
too
i
need
to
find
some
more
serving
type
bottle
final
grade

an
a
i
have
not
had
many
sours
and
while
part
of
that
is
due
to
their
typically
high
price
i
also
do
not
really
enjoy
the
taste
of
a
lot
of
them
hors
série
gose
is
one
of
the
few
that
has
been
able
to
break
that
trend
as
the
saltiness
is
the
perfect
cure
for
this
ones
assertively
acidic
flavour
profile
now
i
am
pumped
to
try
a
few
more
examples
of
this
style
hopefully
its
growing
popularity
will
encourage
other
brewers
to
give
this
style
a
shot
highly
recommended

a

quite

d
this
is
a
very
good
gose
and
ill
be
picking
up
more
if
i
can
the
barnyardlike
qualities
shown
through
over
a
nice
salty
base
o
by
far
the
saltiest
gose
ive
had
by
far
this
is
unique
got
it
in
toronto
drank
in
new
hamburg
on
aug
24th
2014
i
think
theyve
done
a
great
job
the
bottle
and
label
itself
are
very
cool
relatively
light
sessionable
beer
good
for
a
warm
day
this
is
a
pleasant
gose
very
drinkable
and
less
salty
than
westbrook
anderson
valley
or
leipziger
gose
that
may
make
it
more
palateable
to
those
who
do
not
like
gosestyle
beers
the
appearance
and
body
are
typical
of
goses
while
the
aroma
seems
a
little
weak
still
this
is
a
very
pleasant
highly
sessionable
beer
a
salty
and
refreshing
gose
decent
spice
and
florals
open
up
to
delve
into
some
lively
complexity
here
not
too
sour
maybe
some
light
tartness
to
it
but
that
was
about
all
i
registered
creaminess
from
the
wheat
is
there
in
body
but
a
lot
of
the
flavour
is
commanded
by
the
salt
a
tasty
and
light
session
beer
enjoy
the
complex
tart
fruit
and
floral
character
mixed
with
a
strong
earthy
spice
well
balanced
as
it
delivers
a
long
but
crisply
satisfying
finish
good
session
beer
though
the
salty
brine
was
a
bit
much
for
the
most
part
and
it
did
have
a
distinctly
saltwater
character
to
it
initially
worth
trying
enjoy
overall
while
i
have
very
little
experience
with
this
style
i
can
see
the
appeal
if
you
are
feeling
something
different
on
any
given
day
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
o
a
decent
attempt
at
this
style
its
worth
trying
once
but
i
will
not
buy
it
again
i
much
prefer
the
ritterguts
gose
might
have
again
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
o
i
was
really
excited
to
crack
open
my
first
gose
ever
and
it
didnt
disappoint
the
first
sip
was
ridiculously
sour
but
of
course
there
are
many
other
dimensions
to
this
beer
and
they
all
opened
up
as
i
continued
to
drink
it
its
funky
sour
and
salty
but
its
also
light
tasty
and
has
a
fantastic
albeit
subdued
fruit
profile
give
this
one
a
try
to
my
knowledge
the
folks
at
les
trois
mousquetaires
are
born
and
bred
quebecois
but
they
have
the
technical
virtuosity
and
detailed
craftsmanship
of
the
best
german
brewers
add
gose
to
a
list
that
already
included
doppelbock
maibock
rauchbier
hopfenweisse
and
oktoberfest
and
youve
got
the
best
german
lineup
made
outside
of
germany
hands
down
overall
get
a
sense
of
purity
and
cleansing
like
this
beer
is
doing
something
good
for
you
certainly
doing
something
good
for
my
tastebuds
great
for
summer
afternoons
o
im
sorry
but
maybe
gose
just
isnt
my
style
i
poured
it
im
sure
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
its
just
not
for
me
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
od
very
interesting
beer
lots
of
different
flavours
and
interesting
elements
going
on
sour
salty
sweet
a
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
fair
bit
of
on
a
hot
day
overall
very
refreshing
but
the
salt
is
not
a
plus
for
me
yes
i
know
that
is
the
style
and
the
lemonade
flavour
is
heavy
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
gose
but
this
was
more
tart
than
i
expected
o
very
nice
balance
of
tart
sourness
and
saltiness
proving
to
be
an
example
of
the
style
thanks
again
to
papat444
for
sending
it
out

notes
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
salt
notes
with
light
tart
wheat
notes
and
some
light
coriander
notes
body
is
quite
full
considering
the
low
abv
with
good
carbonation
quite
refreshing
though
maybe
a
tad
too
salty
for
my
taste
buds
body
is
hazy
with
the
color
a
cross
between
peach
and
lemonade
bit
of
a
sourish
wheat
aroma
flavor
is
of
lemons
tart
wheat
and
ripe
peaches
refreshing
and
quite
good
hope
they
bottle
this
sometime
soon
overall
an
enjoyable
gose
though
neither
quite
as
sour
nor
as
salty
as
one
might
hope
for
still
it
does
make
for
a
refreshing
citrus
beer
without
dragging
along
ridiculous
levels
of
hops
recommended
despite
the
high
abv
this
is
definitely
more
of
a
traditional
gose
than
are
many
of
the
sharply
citric
and
quite
popular
ones
on
shelf
today
o
it
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
it
has
enough
tartness
to
keep
me
interested
in
the
entire
22
ounce
bottle
22

the
beer
pours
a

about

offwhite

that
fizzled
away
quickly
theres
a
small
amount
of

is
on
the
weak
side
but
its
not
bad
the
brew
smells
like

malt
lime
and
a
bit

it
tastes
like

and
some
earthiness
i
think
its
more
salty
than
tart
i
expected
more
tartness
out
of
this
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a

overall
its
decent
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
at
8

a
bomber
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
cant
say
ive
had
many
gose
ales
but
i
thought
most
of
if
not
all
of
the
other
ones
ive
tried
were
better
than
this
was
o
i
prefer
my
sour
beers
to
be
sour
this
is
tasty
but
i
think
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
of
a
detractor
not
bad
though
i
hope
hoppin

makes
more
sours
in
the

my
only
real
complaint
is
that
this
is
obviously
not
soured
with
lactic
acid
bacteria
more
likely
acid
malt
or
regular
acid
but
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
balanced
offering
otherwise
excellent
drinkability
solid
flavor
if
a
tad
underwhelming
and
a
fair
price
for
what
it
is
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
wish
it
were
more
tart
but
thats
just
how
i
prefer
my
gosés
would
recommend
to
a
friend
and
would
buy
again
wow
very
impressive
my
first
gose
but
this
far
exceeded
my
expectations
reminds
me
of
the
salty
sweet
tartness
of
a
matgarita
mixed
with
the
body
and
mouthfeel
of
a
delicious
unflitered
wheat
ipa
good
stuff
to
answer
the
question
on
every
ones
mind
does
this
come
close
to
westbrook
yes
it
does
is
it
better
no
at
least
for
my
personal
tastes
king
gose
home
is
a
great
beer
and
im
excited
hoppin
frog
decided
to
experiment
with
it
salty
sweet
and
slightly
tart
well
done
serving
type
ontap
the
only
gose
ive
found
i
liked
some
say
its
too
salty
not
for
me
it
was
refreshing
tart
and
crushable
this
is
recommended
the
nose
is
tart
citrus
peel
yeast
good
funk
it
has
a
very
rustic
barnyard
note
the
flavor
is
traditional
gose
lots
of
salt
some
wood
but
i
cant
place
the
barrel
lemon
zest
at
the
end
this
is
good
clean
but
i
never
think
of
a
gose
as
refreshing
due
to
the
saltiness
fun
to
try
i
tried
this
beer
several
times
on
draft
at
the
dew
drop
inn
in
derby
ct
its
a
fantastic
sour
that
left
me
wanting
more
the
salt
was
more
obvious
the
second
time
i
tried
it
as
opposed
to
the
first
i
believe
we
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
the
second
time
i
tried
it
anyways
if
you
can
find
it
in
a
bottle
at
the
store
or
see
it
on
draft
at
a
bar
then
youd
be
foolish
not
to
try
it
awesome
brew
the
22
price
tag
was
a
little
more
than
i
wanted
to
spend
but
looks
like
it
was
well
worth
it
ill
be
buying
another
bottle
or
two
at
some
point
glad
i
had
a
glass
not
a
huge
fan
of
sour
beers
but
this
was
refreshing
and
although
fairly
fizzy
it
hit
the
spot
after
wandering
the
streets
of
rome
and
getting
lost
while
trying
to
find
a
few
sights
berry
sweet
salty
sour
funk
absolutely
delicious
nothing
else
to
say
kind
of
plain
less
sour
certainly
less
funky
and
less
interesting
than
most
goses
overall
strange
but
really
good
the
salty
character
is
weird
but
somehow
it
works
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
to
try

this
beer
blew
my
mind
i
was
confused
and
delighted
by
sip
and
sniff
tingly
delight
i
really
like
this
beer
and
have
been
drinking
it
a
lot
lately
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
in
the
summer
i
can
drink
a
bunch
of
them
and
not
be
feeling
it
too
much
and
they
are
very
refreshing
solid
beer
and
a
good
price
for
a
sour
in
a
can
a
delicious
crisp
tart
salty
refreshing
take
on
gose
the
blood
orange
is
noticed
but
does
not
dominate
good
saltysour
balance
no
fakeartificial
flavor
notes
and
not
overly
restrained
like
some
takes
a
nearly
perfect
summer
beer
overall
im
a
fan
its
unusual
in
a
good
way
and
has
a
refreshing
quality
it
reminds
me
of
vichycelestins
mineral
water
that
i
had
in
southern
france
fairly
clean
finish
dry
middle
a
pretty
solid
coating
of
the
upper
palate
is
the
only
strike
against
this
brew
though
i
didnt
find
the
coriander
either
below
average
brew
in
my
opinion
poured
a
clear
orange
body
with
a
halffinger
of
bubbly
white
head
overall
impression
of
appearance
is
of
a
gose
in
head
with
the
blood
oranges
shown
in
the
color
of
the
body
scents
of
salt
water
with
an
oceanlike
quality
mingling
with
mediumlight
aromas
of
blood
orange
and
spicy
coriander
and
a
light
earth
funk
from
the
yeast
and
light
lactic
acid
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
typical
gose
true
to
form
but
with
a
good
use
of
blood
orange
to
add
an
additional
bright
aroma
to
the
beer
quite
nice
flavor
begins
lightly
sour
with
notes
of
lactic
acid
with
a
plan
yogurt
quality
moderate
saltiness
tangy
wheat
malt
flavors
at
moderate
levels
and
a
light
level
of
blood
orange
middle
gains
in
sourness
with
notes
of
lactic
acid
still
providing
the
sourness
bright
fruitiness
of
blood
orange
at
moderate
levels
and
a
moderate
level
of
saltiness
and
tangy
wheat
finish
is
highly
tart
with
strong
notes
of
lactic
acid
moderate
saltiness
a
nice
tangy
wheat
malt
still
present
and
a
mediumlight
blood
orange
flavor
aftertaste
is
tart
with
notes
of
lactic
acid
grainy
tangy
wheat
malt
and
salt
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
classic
gose
tart
salty
and
true
to
style
but
enhanced
by
tangy
sweet
blood
orange
a
very
refreshing
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
effervescent
carbonation
and
puckering
drying
mouthfeel
that
urges
you
to
take
another
sip
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
wonderful
gose
that
is
true
to
style
and
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
an
amazing
gose
it
is
traditional
in
its
base
but
the
blood
orange
takes
the
aroma
and
flavor
to
new
levels
and
makes
this
a
fine
refreshing
beer
fantastic
the
pour
is
light
orange
with
less
head
than
pours
a
light
colored
peachy
orange
color
that
is
cloudy
and
with
a
little
head
there
is
no
lacing
the
odor
is
sour
citrus
orange
lemon
tangerine
sparkling
cognac
slight
peach
the
taste
is
crisp
tart
sour
at
first
but
then
fresh
cut
orange
lemon
grapefruit
peel
no
long
aftertaste
sour
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
a
bit
salty
but
not
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
the
look
and
smell
not
all
that
good
but
the
sour
tangy
taste
is
different
and
enjoyable
had
in
can
when
opened
there
was
a
significant
head
smells
like
sour
orange
tastes
the
same
but
more
pungent
and
with
a
distinct
saltiness
feels
quite
carbonated
and
rough
on
the
teeth
much
like
soda
there
was
also
a
weird
grain
or
corn
note
in
the
aftertaste
probably
true
to
the
style
but
i
didnt
like
it
and
wont
be
having
it
again
to
sour
for
my
taste
nice
tart
blood
orange
flavor
with
a
salty
finish
this
is
a
gose
on
performance
enhancers
the
expected
flavors
are
all
turned
up
and
the
added
citrus
punch
melds
nicely
with
the
generous
lactobacillus
treatment
to
yield
ample
pucker
power
tart
and
citrus
seems
to
be
the
theme
here
and
thats
about
right
first
time
with
this
style
and
may
not
be
my
speed
very
light
comes
from
their
session
series
but
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
on
a
hot
afternoon
you
could
definitely
enjoy
a
couple
or
three
and
not
feel
bloated
or
buzzed
the
blood
orange
adds
a
very
nice
citrus
finish
taste
on
the
tongue
bam
blam
more
and
more
sour
a
blast
and
a
half
of
fierce
fruit
the
tart
attack
never
quits
its
a
solid
salvo
that
blasts
anew
with
each
fresh
sip
the
lacto
is
hard
at
work
here
spreading
the
sour
lambics
are
so
oldschool
yesterdays
news
its
fruity
its
dry
its
creamy
and
its
sour
what
a
truly
magnificent
beer
this
is
bracing
refreshing
sweet
and
sour
and
everything
nice
serving
type
can
lacking
on
the
tart
qualities
compared
to
the
base
beer
but
the
citrus
addition
does
offer
an
interesting
element
to
the
style
o
this
is
really
tasty
i
really
like
the
blood
orange
may
be
a
bit
fruity
vs
malthop
for
some
but
its
a
unique
delicious
beer
pretty
good
although
one
of
the
key
things
about
blood
oranges
is
the
blood
color
which
is
missing
here
otherwise
it
is
true
to
style
as
a
gose
appearance
other
than
the
blood
thing
was
good
with
a
huge
though
short
lived
creamcolored
foamy
head
and
a
clear
honey
amber
color
aroma
was
oranges
berries
lacto
flavors
like
nose
fairly
balanced
for
the
style
salt
comes
out
more
in
the
finish
and
is
pleasant
bodys
excellent
this
is
maybe
the
best
most
drinkable
gose
ive
ever
had
wish
their
oranges
wouldve
been
bloodier
way
to
tart
almost
like
it
wasnt
ripe
overall
this
is
a
darned
tasty
beer
its
way
citrusy
for
a
gose
but
if
one
isnt
expecting
that
just
from
the
name
alone
one
may
be
illiterate
its
definitely
a
repeater
only
slight
hints
of
salt
and
acid
focus
is
on
the
fruit
which
i
like
lots
of
tart
orange
f
thin
and
dry
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
no
lacing
smell
isntypical
gose
fairly
indescript
very
little
citrus
the
nose
was
somewhat
misleading
as
thr
taste
is
full
of
vibrant
and
unmistakable
blood
orange
flavor
that
balances
very
well
with
the
funky
minerally
tartness
of
the
base
beer
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
lively
carbonation
perfect
summer
session
beer
for
anythong
outdoors
refreshing
and
delicious
im
partial
to
sours
this
one
is
no
exception
very
good
overall
this
is
a
nice

plenty
of

um

a
gose
in
a
can
that
it
is
widely
available
is
a
welcome
thing
overall
a
crisp
refreshing
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
definitely
drink
with
a
meal
otherwise
heartburn
is
a
serious
possibility
with
this
nice
tart
flavor
from
the
orange
and
light
flavors
overall
but
the
salt
overpowers
the
good
flavors
for
me
whether
or
not
thats
correct
for
the
style
or
not
its
still
not
pleasant

me

it

it

7
will
have
to
drink
this
one
again
this
summer
not
my
style
subdued
sour
or
super
tart
o
delicious
sessionable
and
better
than
any
other
gose
ive
had
its
low
price
and
easy
availability
makes
it
a
nobrainer
to
try
i
guess
this
just
isnt
my
style
i
wasnt
much
of
a
fan
of
the
original
version
the
orange
addition
does
little
to
change
my
mind
this
beer
will
make
you
pucker
up
but
its
delicious
pour
and
color
are
lovely
mouthfeel
was
just
what
id
hopedcrisp
and
light
overall
just
not
for
me
o
tasty
if
youre
into
the
sourness
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
you
want
a
sour
bomb
taste
like
red
bull
but
i
like
red
bull
good
summer
beer
decent
head
to
start
quickly
fades
to
nothing
nothing
at
all
not
my
thing
looks
kind
of
like
a
faded
orange
soda
nose
is
tart
soap
with
a
hint
of
orange
at
the
end
taste
is
tart
to
start
followed
by
some
fruitiness
has
an
aftertaste
i
dont
love
it
does
have
a
nice
refreshing
tarty
crispness
to
it
i
bet
i
would
appreciate
this
beer
a
lot
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
starts
with
an
amazing
citrus
flavor
from
the
oranges
edns
with
mild
tart
with
only
some
salt
back
end
could
improve
this
beer
was
way
too
sour
o
very
nice
gose
a
major
improvement
over
the
base
gose
from
the
same
brewery
i
have
received
this
a
couple
times
as
an
extra
in
trades
and
finally
opened
one
very
pleasantly
surprised
wonderful
blood
orange
smell
and
taste
really
exceptional
example
of
the
style
light
saltiness
right
at
the
beginning
and
and
the
very
end
blood
orange
flavor
is
dominate
yet
not
overpowering
additional
flavors
include
peach
and
lime
light
cloudiness
moderately
carbonated
all
in
all
an
exceptional
beer
for
sour
lovers
the
taste
is
salt
blood
orange
some
peach
and
light
pilsner
malt
the
salt
is
present
in
the
beginning
and
the
finish
the
blood
orange
adds
a
different
type
of
sweetness
to
the
beer
really
tasty
and
one
i
will
revisit
so
good
so
crushable
note
i
drink
this
from
the
can
so
i
cant
accurately
judge
the
appearance
of
the
drink
itself
sour
but
not
super
sour
light
acidic
blood
orange
flavor
o
this
was
my
first
foray
into
the
gose
style
and
i
liked
it
its
almost
like
a
berliner
in
that
its
a
sour
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
loved
it
and
will
be
seeking
this
out
especially
for
the
summer
well
done
overall
one
of
the
sourest
yet
smoothest
beers
in
a
while
and
at
2
dollars
a
pop
it
will
make
any
sour
beer
fan
happy
i
would
get
it
again
seems
like
a
great
summer
beer
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
use
of
blood
oranges
in
a
beer
choosing
a
gose
as
the
beer
style
to
add
blood
oranges
to
was
a
great
thinking
outside
of
the
box
kind
of
idea
its
a
cool
way
to
americanize
this
not
so
frequently
brewed
german
beer
style
this
is
by
far
the
most
creative
and
well
done
beer
by
this
brewery
that
i
have
tried
it
would
be
cool
if
they
made
a
series
of
fruited
gose
beers
and
please
keep
packing
the
beer
in
a
can
has
a
very
citrus
feel
and
intense
sour
flavor
overall
a
really
good
take
on
a
gose
good
zesty
and
tart
fruit
flavors
with
some
nice
funk
had
on
tap
at
amsterdam
cafe
only
downside
i
could
possibly
see
was
the
lack
of
a
head
even
with
a
semihard
pour
i
got
an
almost
nonexistent
head
that
dissipated
within
seconds
i
dont
really
care
though
because
the
taste
more
than
made
up
for
that
malty
smell
with
a
bit
of
orange
first
taste
has
a
slight
amount
of
orange
then
finishes
with
the
perfect
amount
of
sour
great
gose
small
quick
dying
head
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
above
a
washed
out
straw
golden
colored
beer
looking
at
this
beer
before
taking
a
sip
of
it
i
wasnt
expecting
anything
more
than
a
shock
top
tasting
beer
having
said
that
i
was
slightly
surprised
that
this
beer
has
a
better
taste
than
the
look
and
aroma
has
to
offer
this
beer
comes
with
a
slight
sourish
taste
without
much
of
the
advertized
orange
and
i
liked
that
better
although
it
takes
a
sip
or
three
to
appreciate
the
taste
it
grows
on
the
taste

quickly
sizzles
and
pops
as
it
dissipates
into
a
fizzy
band
around
the
shoulders
blood
oranges
are
very
apparent
in
the
nose
its
almost
reminiscent
of
fanta
orange
cola
saltiness
is
evident
from
the
first
quaff
and
the
blood
orange
is
a
bit
diminished
in
the
flavor
profile
coming
off
spritzy
and
citrusy
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
a
kiss
of
acidity
that
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
along
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
ive
only
had
this
style
a
couple
of
times
and
they
all
have
left
a
slightly
different
impression
that
said
i
found
this
enjoyable
and
look
forward
to
visiting
it
again
during
warmer
weather
the
typical
anderson
valley
gose
delivers
very
well
but
the
deliverance
of
oranges
really
gives
this
a
shot
in
the
arm
theres
very
little
saltiness
and
the
sweetness
is
tempered
what
you
have
is
a
delicious
beer
with
an
amazing
drinkability
orange
body
with
tart
taste
one
of
my
favorite
beer
styles
overall
a
really
enjoyable
gose
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
again
at
this
point
gose
not
my
thing
o
a
very
good
beer
if
you
like
sour
citrus
it
offers
enough
fruitiness
to
entice
sour
beer
neophytes
while
still
offering
an
interesting
beer
experience
for
more
seasoned
drinkers
an
excellent
alternative
to
the
ubiquitous
shandies
o
near
challenging
tartness
yet
delicious
and
refreshing
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
is
my
first
dabble
in
this
style
so
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
here
except
for
some
reviews
and
the
description
on
the
can
i
can
taste
the
blood
orange
along
with
wheat
malts
a
big
tart
flavor
comes
in
halfway
with
a
little
saltiness
too
tart
for
my
liking
but
i
gave
a
good
review
because
i
think
that
is
what
this
style
should
be

o

beer
i
think
i
found
my
new
substitute
for
when
westbrook
gose
is
not
in
season
this
will
be
staple
in
my
fridge

why
not
this
stuff
pours
a
clear

topped
by
a

of

the

comprises
orange
zest
lemon
peel
very
light
biscuit
and
a
kiss
on
each
cheek
one
from
ginger
and
one
from
lime
were
popular
the
taste
centers
on
tart
blood
orange
and
lemon
zest
but
also
in
the
mix
are
mild
ginger
and
a
vague
sweetness
one
that
underflows
everything
along
with
a
twinge
of
brine
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
straddles
the
line
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
leaning
toward
the
former
though
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
very
enjoyable
gose
that
doesnt
overdo
the
tartness
maintaining
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
im
not
sure
if
i
prefer
this
one
over
the
regular
gose
but
i
can
say
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
either
were
they
offered
to
me
good
times
crisp
refreshing
great
summer
beer
really
crisp
refreshing
beer
they
advertise
orange
that
is
definitely
what
you
get
sharp
salty
hit
upfront
finishes
dry
with
the
lingering
citrus
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
almost
on
a
champagne
level
would
be
great
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
the
blood
orange
works
remarkably
well
with
the
sour
tart
salty
base
im
not
sure
if
the
base
would
stand
up
as
a
worthwhile
gose
but
this
finished
product
is
truly
charming
try
it
its
strange
and
not
in
the
good
way
o
a
fine
sour
gose
a
great
light
beer
to
enjoy
with
any
dish
cheers
o
rock
solid
less
of
a
revelation
than
the
standard
gose
because
the
fruit
actually
clouds
the
grain
salt
combination
but
the
addition
of
the
orange
makes
for
its
own
combination
of
citrus
and
salt
that
is
itself
extraordinary
as
soon
as
i
get
back
into
the
av
distribution
area
im
going
to
buy
myself
a
whole
lot
more
of
this
overall
a
mouth
puckering
gose
with
a
whole
lot
of
blood
orange
the
sourness
may
be
overwhelming
for
some
it
just
takes
some
getting
used
to
otherwise
a
unique
brew
that
takes
the
style
to
another
level
overall
this
is
much
better
than
anderson
valleys
original
gose
overall
super
refreshing
beer
with
a
great
taste
i
havent
had
too
many
of
this
style
but
this
is
the
best
ive
had
so
far
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
light
fizzy
head
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
funk
citrus
and
wheat
in
the
taste
a
nice
snap
of
tartness
and
citrus
flavor
from
the
blood
orange
that
may
add
a
light
acidic
tone
pretty
nice
for
a
mass
produced
gose
light
bodied
and
drinks
super
easily
just
a
little
tang
mid
sip
that
makes
you
want
another
sip
for
fans
of
the
style
or
open
minded
drinkers
this
would
be
a
hit
this
beer
is
simply
a
salty
sweet
master
piece
as
id
hope
and
expect
for
the
body
is
light
mildly
effervescent
and
refreshing
it
drinks
cleanly
and
is
all
around
enjoyable
just
like
with
avs
other
gose
i
think
they
knocked
this
out
of
the
park
delicious
the
best
gose
to
try
if
you
have
never
drank
one
delicious
and
the
blood
orange
really
compliments
the
gose
style
overall
lots
of
sweet
and
tart
orange
its
nice
tasted
awful
just
a
brutal
sour
drink
o
pleasantly
sweet
and
tart
an
interesting
variation
on
gose
without
as
much
emphasis
on
the
salt
and
coriander
very
drinkable
easy
to
go
back
to
perhaps
i
am
alone
in
this
but
i
prefer
the
straight
up
gose
they
do
to
this
one
by
a
considerable
margin
its
just
not
adding
all
that
much
aside
from
sweetness
that
i
really
think
doesnt
belong
in
this
style
based
on
refreshment
it
adds
a
nice
color
to
the
brew
and
stains
the
head
a
little
bit
in
the
glass
the
fruit
adds
a
nice
citrus
tang
to
the
nose
which
i
would
describe
as
the
fruits
greatest
contribution
to
the
beer
its
zesty
and
a
cool
wrinkle
with
the
coriander
that
is
pretty
heavy
in
here
too
the
flavor
though
the
fruit
never
comes
through
as
much
as
it
does
in
the
nose
and
it
just
seems
sort
of
sweet
to
me
covers
up
the
salt
and
presents
itself
more
as
a
fruit
beer
than
as
a
gose
i
liked
the
simplicity
of
the
other
one
but
i
can
see
the
appeal
here
too
its
still
refreshing
but
not
as
dry
as
i
would
have
hoped
still
acidic
and
still
brilliantly
carbonated
cool
project
had
to
go
on
a
wild
gose
chase
for
this
one
was
not
disappointed
the
blood
orange
comes
through
but
you
still
get
the
salty
sourness
desired
in
the
style
o
a
nice
step
up
from
their
standard
gose
12
ounce
can
no
canning
date
that
i
could
find
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
mostly
clear
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
decent
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
at
all
the
brew
smells
like
orange
soda
limecitrus
and
a
bit
of
saltiness
i
like
the
taste
of
this
it
tastes
like
blood
oranges
salt
limes
and
some
tang
citrus
drink
its
sweet
tart
and
a
bit
salty
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
a
bit
coating
and
is
very
refreshing
even
on
a
cold
day
im
still
liking
this
its
a
good
sessionable
brew
just
the
thing
im
looking
for
when
i
want
to
end
the
night
with
one
more
good
beer
that
isnt
very
high
in
abv
and
i
figure
this
would
be
really
good
on
a
hot
day
im
liking
this
one
more
and
more
the
longer
i
drink
it
definitely
worth
trying
and
its
priced
well
at
8
99
a
6
pack
yeah
i
think
ill
be
buying
this
again
soon
sour
taste
too
overpowering
makes
beer
significantly
less
palatable
orange
prominent
with
nice
gose
taste
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
experience
if
you
are
looking
for
a
unique
off
beat
brew
clear
red
slight
pink
body
head
dissipated
very
fast
fruity
soda
pop
aroma
similar
to
flavored
sprite
wooo
this
is
tart
taste
is
big
tart
with
a
punch
of
sea
salt
good
amount
of
blood
orange
taste
interesting
but
good
hazycloudy
yellow
wit
thin
head
and
mild
lacing
strong
aromas
just
not
too
pleasing
not
really
as
orange
as
expected
but
more
of
a
candy
fruit
tastes
of
mild
orange
dry
an
a
sweet
tart
finish
decent
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
week
but
thhhis
was
honestly
the
first
of
this
style
ive
sampled
i
doubt
i
would
be
tempted
to
go
back
to
this
overall
a
very
good
gose
and
worth
getting
on
a
hot
summers
day
poured
from
the
can
into
a
wine
glass
color
is
light
to
medium
amberorange
with
maybe
a
hint
of
pink
very
little
head
initially
i
smelled
a
good
amount
of
sprite
on
this
which
was
obviously
a
turnoff
however
5
minutes
in
that
aroma
had
faded
away
completely
and
a
nice
tart
orange
aroma
presented
itself
that
taste
is
a
big
tart
blast
with
a
touch
of
citrus
little
to
no
noticeable
salt
body
is
light
crisp
overall
a
decent
take
on
the
gose
style
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
but
not
anything
id
buy
regularly
nice
orange
flavor
in
the
finish
not
over
the
top
in
any
one
flavor
slightly
tart
not
overly
sour
good
flavor
this
is
an
exceptional
gose
only
second
to
wbst
gose
salty
fanta
or
orangina
in
the
best
alcoholic
way
possible
it
works
a
bit
saltier
and
tart
than
i
was
thinking
still
a
solid
gose
most
fun
drink
ive
had
thank
you
anderson
valley
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
found
a
domestic
gose
sold
in
a
6pack
and
man
it
is
good
one
of
my
first
experiences
with
a
gose
and
this
is
pretty
good
tastes
exactly
as
it
sounds
worth
trying
overall
this
works
pretty
well
more
of
a
novelty
for
me
than
something
i
would
want
on
a
regular
basis
worth
trying
for
sure
outlier
detected
justify
rating
with
a
review
very
tart
great
orange
aroma
and
smooth
mouth
feel
but
too
tart
totally
sessionable
beer
smooth
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
taste
has
a
slight
orange
flavor
and
perfect
balance
of
sour
great
initial
taste
but
once
you
swallow
the
beer
the
sea
saltlike
dryness
becomes
quite
apparent
and
leaves
an
unpleasant
taste
in
your
mouth
a
light
beer
with
a
very
interesting
flavor
profile
the
blood
orange
is
pronounced
and
pairs
well
with
the
saltiness
of
the
gose
style
ive
never
thought
the
salt
was
very
present
in
gose
until
this
one
where
its
way
too
strong
everything
is
completely
overpowered
by
the
salt
mouth
feel
and
flavor
are
mostly
seawater
with
a
spritz
of
orange
in
the
nose
i
liked
the
regular
av
gose
ill
stick
to
that
smells
like
straw
and
oranges
tastes
like
orange
soda
up
frontseriously
like
fanta
i
know
its
real
oranges
not
orange
flavoring
but
the
combination
of
sour
bacteria
and
oj
lends
it
a
pleasant
ersatz
feel
this
is
followed
up
by
a
middle
and
finish
that
more
befit
a
berliner
than
a
gose
chewy
yeast
mellowing
out
the
sour
nodes
nicely
and
finishing
on
a
light
node
of
salt
its
brother
regular
gose
with
the
strange
name
is
a
better
beer
but
this
is
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
and
interesting
recommended
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
white
head
tartness
coriander
orange
citrus
and
some
raw
wheat
on
the
nose
follows
onto
the
palate
finishes
tart
dry
and
salty
almost
as
good
as
the
original
tart
dry
just
the
right
amount
of
juicy
orange
flavor
could
drink
anytime
light
orange
slightly
hazy
with
very
slight
carbonization
orange
is
apparent
on
the
nose
but
not
much
else
going
on
taste
follows
the
nose
with
strong
but
pleasant
orange
flavor
that
is
balance
well
with
the
salinity
all
in
all
a
refreshing
beer
bit
of
sparkly
carbonization
on
the
finish
its
a
very
tart
gose
bubbly
with
carbonation
pulpy
blood
orange
sharp
flavors
i
like
this
better
than
their
regular
gose
the
slight
citrus
is
a
bonus
overall
i
can
dig
it
i
dont
know
that
i
could
stomach
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
at
a
time
due
to
the
immense
sourness
but
i
wouldnt
mind
one
from
time
to
time
i
dont
know
that
i
get
blood
orange
character
so
much
as
just
a
general
orange
sweetness
but
its
a
genuine
flavor
will
buy
again
if
only
a
can
at
a
time
orangey
in
color
the
blood
orange
notes
certainly
come
through
in
both
the
nose
and
the
flavor
profile
i
liked
the
first
gose
in
the
hwy
128
session
series
but
this
one
is
really
good
a
true
breakfast
beer
poured
out
of
a
12
oz
can
into
my
stange
glass
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
cloudyhazy
but
mainly
clear
light
to
medium
golden
color
with
a
slight
orange
hue
and
lots
of
little
bubbles
rapidly
and
continuously
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
has
nice
big
fluffy
looking
white
head
that
is
well
over
an
inch
thick
when
first
poured
into
the
glass
that
settles
pretty
quickly
at
that
unfortunately
to
a
thin
white
ring
lining
the
inside
of
the
glass
with
practically
zero
lacing
has
a
very
distinct
orangecitrus
aroma
along
with
what
i
do
believe
is
a
hint
of
wheat
has
a
nice
slightly
sour
and
tart
yet
also
sweet
at
the
same
time
somehow
citrusorange
flavor
upfront
along
with
a
sort
of
musty
earthy
bread
like
quality
and
of
course
a
nice
hint
of
salt
has
a
very
crisp
yet
smooth
slightly
prickly
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
a
really
fine
effort
here
quite
and
enjoyable
beer
very
easy
to
drink
in
the
way
good
beer
should
be
everyone
should
try
this
beer
i
dont
like
sours
but
this
isnt
bad
its
interesting
overall
not
bad
just
tasted
like
a
tart
orange
soda
highly
recommended
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
great
company
terrible
style
mmm
oranges
everyone
loves
gose
lactic
sourness
and
citrus
saturates
the
palate
reminiscent
of
my
favorite
pellegrino
citrus
soda
feels
just
a
bit
too
thin
for
me
overall
the
blood
orange
is
an
interesting
addition
to
the
gose
but
to
a
certain
extent
i
yearn
for
just
the
gose
base
still
you
can
hardly
fault
it
light
bodied
lower
alcohol
and
refreshing
if
the
tart
aspect
doesnt
bother
you
it
can
be
really
drinkable
darker
golden
color
the
citrus
is
very
evident
the
beer
is
exactly
how
one
would
imagine
a
blood
orange
gose
to
be
which
is
to
say
tasty
and
light
anderson
valley
blood
orange
gose
45
a
pretty
wellmade
gose
overall
the
guest
fruit
ingredient
not
as
invasive
as
initially
thought
though
it
does
duly
draw
one
in
tasty
tart
and
dry
and
maybe
a
wee
bit
hard
on
the
palate
my
tongue
now
craving
something
sweet
overall
this
beer
is
interestingly
delicious
the
flavor
and
body

pale

with
thick
white
head
a
bit
of
funk
in
the
aroma
tart
tangy
citrusy
and
salty
taste
refreshing
and
sessionable
not
quite
as
crisp
as
it
could
be
though
o
not
the
most
complex
ive
had
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
glad
i
could
find
this
one
after
having
the
blood
orange
variant
which
i
thought
was
really
tasty
too
touches
on
some
of
the
positive
qualities
of
a
gose
but
lacks
depth
in
my
opinion
thin
and
light
body
quite
easy
to
drink
but
you
dont
want
to
chug
it
lots
of
carbonation
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
once
you
get
used
to
the
style
great
sour
nice
tart
apple
flavor
with
a
hint
of
citrus
not
having
much
or
any
experience
with
the
style
im
left
pretty
satisfied
my
one
knock
is
that
i
actually
feel
like
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
coming
in
from
somewhere
yeah
theres
an
intense
tartsweetsalty
kind
of
combination
going
on
but
other
than
the
biscuity
finish
and
pretty
slight
orange
flavor
theres
not
much
else
there
regardless
this
is
a
beer
that
deserves
a
look
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
tasty
gose
i
will
definitely
repeat
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
deep
straw
yellow
producing
2
fingers
of
mineral
water
effervescent
shortlived
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
no

aroma
has
a
low
malt
profile
but
i
detect
pilsner
malts
wheat
oddly
in
that
order
it
is
crisp
dry
with
hints
of
green
apple
lemon
lime
brine
it
may
be
my
imagination
but
a
little
grassy
hop
hint
taste
opens
with
salinity
lactic
acid
sourness
largely
persist
overpowering
hints
of
pilsner

tart
green

i
enjoyed
this
beers

immensely
and
will
make
this
a
regular
session
beer
summer
or
hell
any

of

if
i
can
find
it

an

more
or

didnt
impress
me
o
solid
beer
tasty
and
refreshing
no
real
flaws
missing
some
intangibles
to
make
it
great
light
straw
body
fast
dissipating
head
sorry
if
people
like
it
but
the
smell
reminds
me
of
puke
the
vomit
smell
you
get
when
you
drink
to
much
cheap
booze
taste
is
similar
do
not
like
it
at
all
reminds
me
of
drinking
too
much
and
getting
sick
back
in
highschool
verdict
a
nice
gose
from
anderson
valley
and
probably
the
best
option
for
a
year
round
widely
available
gose
though
troublesome
from
off
color
certainly
gives
this
a
run
for
its
money
still
enjoyable
during
winter
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
warm
weather
options
out
there
this
is
a
grat
beer
if
you
dont
like
gose
it
isnt
this
beers
fault
o
it
is
a
rare
day
when
i
find
something
truly
new
to
me
in
beer
this
was
extraordinary
a
first
foray
i
guarantee
it
will
not
be
my
last
the
experience
is
not
too
different
from
a
juicy
ipa
but
instead
of
big
hops
the
gose
comes
with
sourness
and
saltiness
skeptical
i
found
this
not
only
works
but
is
a
winning
combination
thank
you
anderson
valley
tart
salty
crisp
nice
departure
from
what
most
beers
have
become
lately
like
it
o
it
is
quite
a
refreshing
brew
i
am
not
a
fan
of
salt
but
it
is
nice
with
the
dry
finish
this
would
have
been
a
more
better
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
than
a
cold
january
day
but
it
still
hits
the
spot
im
surprised
that
something
so
light
in
alcohol
has
so
much
flavor
and
bite
its
dry
and
a
bit
sour
nicely
carbonated
and
very
refreshing
reminds
me
of
a
wine
cooler
i
would
probably
prefer
this
to
a
session
ipa
because
those
tend
to
be
subdued
and
this
has
a
lot
going
on
would
likely
go
well
with
fish
or
salad
i
like
some
people
giving
it
a
very
low
rating
are
probably
not
familiar
with
gose
and
are
expecting
a
regular
beer
this
beer
was
not
very
good
tart
dry
refreshing
one
of
my
favorites
to
drink
at
any
time
grabs
hold
like
a
sour
patch
kid
overall
its
good
think
i
liked
their
blood
orange
gose
slightly
better
these
brews
are
just
so
dang
tart
that
its
tough
to
put
down
more
than
a
few
at
a
time
o
good
stuff
that
i
thought
was
a
oneoff
or
rotating
some
reason
but
it
seems
to
be
yearround
now
now
to
nab
some
of
the
fruited
variants
i
hope
for
better
next
time
very
drinkable
brew
not
going
to
jump
up
and
down
for
it
but
worth
the
money
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
worth
getting
if
you
can
i
was
definitely
surprised
to
find
that
one
of
the
rarest
beer
forms
was
being
sold
yearround
instead
of
seasonally
this
is
some
refreshing
unique
deliciousness
right
here
overall
a
bit
like
unsweetened
lemonade
very
tart
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sour
in
my
humble
opinion
any
sour
flavor
does
not
belong
in
my
beer
i
drank
enough
to
get
a
legitimate
taste
of
this
beer
but
could
not
fathom
more
than
a
couple
ounces
total
this
is
my
first
time
trying
a
gose
and
i
must
say
this
might
be
my
new
favourite
beer
type
unlike
anything
ive
ever
tasted
before
this
will
definitely
be
one
i
keep
coming
back
to
overall
interesting
im
mixed
on
it
it
is
quite
refreshing
and
enjoyable
but
so
sour
and
tart
nice
blend
of
the
salt
and
flavors
actually
it
was
pretty
nice
for
a
gose
overall
too
tart
for
me
to
session
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
perhaps
better
reserved
for
july
and
not
late
november
overall
someone
else
wrote
a
review
stating
that
theyre
not
over
the
moon
with
the
style
agree
on
that
i
was
really
excited
though
to
try
it
it
seriously
has
been
something
ive
been
hoping
brewers
would
attempt
again
they
also
make
a
blood
orange
flavored
gose
which
has
an
additional
almost
acrid
acidity
but
some
orange
brightness
if
you
want
something
different
this
definitely
falls
into
the
category
and
despite
the
flavors
it
kind
of
grows
on
you
and
in
virtue
of
its
light
body
and
bracing
saltwatery
nature
is
actually
super
easy
to
drink
overall
i
am
not
over
the
moon
with
this
style
but
i
actually
like
this
i
could
recommend
this
to
those
who
are
not
too
familiar
or
just
getting
into
the
gose
style
this
really
does
remind
me
of
the
malt
liquor
style
brew
just
with
more
tartness
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
could
sit
back
and
slam
a
few
of
these
watching
a
baseball
game
this
brew
is
worthy
this
is
a
very
tart
beer
i
get
that
it
is
a
gose
but
whammy
the
beer
pours
crisp
clear
yellow
with
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
and
taste
is
like
a
sweetart
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
in
body
with
big
carbonation
overall
i
will
not
have
this
again
dont
like
the
style
crisp
tart
and
refreshing
goes
strong
berry
tartness
that
pairs
well
with
roasted
meat
would
drink
again
and
ranks
up
there
with
westbrook
gose
poured
from
purple
can
into
nonic

pale
golden

a
slight
hint
of
haze
good

well

foam
as
it
settles
nose
is
a
little
tame
with
some
bready
notes
in
there
and
a
hint
of
tangy
citrus
the
palate
was
a
big
surprise
with
the
lovely
sour
citrusy
flavors
nice
and
sour
and
also
very
drinkable
some
herbal
qualities
on
the
palate
as
it
goes
to
the
finish
and
aftertaste
would
get
a
6pk
next
summer
as
of
now
its
stout
season
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
big
white
head
it
looks
like
champagne
smell
is
mostly
of
light
bready
malts
with
some
tartness
and
citrus
taste
is
very
tart
upfront
with
some
citrus
then
the
malt
comes
in
just
enough
to
remind
you
this
is
a
beer
and
not
a
cider
or
champagne
nice
salty
finish
with
a
tartness
that
lingers
mouthfeel
is
super
light
and
crisp
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
although
i
could
drink
it
at
any
time
overall
this
is
pretty
good
its
my
first
gose
so
i
wasnt
completely
sure
of
what
to
expect
but
i
think
i
was
pretty
close
i
got
this
and
the
blood
orange
version
as
well
should
be
even
better
overall
pretty
good
very
tart
for
a
gose
not
my
favorite
but
i
digged
it
and
would
buy
it
again
eric
this
gose
is
crisp
and
tart
with

thats
the
taste
this
is
mild

a

so
i
can

this
being

beer
for

light

tart
wheaty

lots
of
hay
some
funk
and
a
bit
dry
and
salty
as
expected
flavor
is
sweet
honey

wheat
from
the
malts
up
front
just
a
tinge
of
tart
some
tangy
salty
notes
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
and
finishes
with
some
pineapple
and
a
dirty
wheaty
finish
light
bodied
with
medium
plus
plus
carbonation
overall
much
sweeter
than
others
in
the
style
ive
had
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
a
bit
bland
and
what
flavor
that
is
there
is
just
weird
oh
well
another
tick
similar
to
a
german
sour
very
tart
and
not
a
great
smell
listen
i
admit
that
gose
is
apparently
just
not
my
style
while
this
is
admittedly
my
first
gose
im
pretty
sure
and
by
all
accounts
its
a
great
example
of
the
style
apparently
gose
is
just
not
for
me
enjoy
it
if
youre
into
it
ill
leave
them
for
you
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
the
tart
and
salty
aspects
that
i
expect
from
the
style
and
it
lived
up
to
its
claim
as
being
a
good
session
beer
for
the
warm
weather
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
very
dry
on
the
finish
a
little
crisp
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
just
when
i
think
the
tartness
and
salty
flavors
would
start
to
wear
on
me
i
end
up
coming
back
for
more
so
i
think
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
on
a
really
hot
day
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
and
the
mouthfeel
when
it
came
to
the
taste
it
had
really
nice
balance
and
none
of
the
aspects
were
too
overpowering
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
just
a
little
bland
with
a
little
too
much
grainy
malts
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
might
actually
get
a
six
pack
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
doesnt
mind
a
little
tartness
and
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
then
its
for
sure
worth
a
try
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
was
just
what
i
expect
from
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
it
doesnt
feel
like
it
should
be
so
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
it
isnt
my
favorite
gose
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
from
this
brewery
good
job
guys
thinks
for
doing
this
style
justice
keep
up
the
good
work
a
bit
like
drinking
seawater
but
nevertheless
good
tasty
session
beer
i
think
they
should
let
the
beer
character
shine
more
by
tuning
down
the
salt
and
the
tartness

about
right

to
me
average

this

is
a
tasty
beverage
geuze
is
supposed
to
be
funky
like
the
livestock
are
at
the
county
fair
but
this
beer
hits
some
of
the
points
is
very
drinkable
great
sour
flavor
o
this
is
my
first
ever
gose
and
i
didnt
expect
to
like
it
as
much
as
i
did
this
a
a
good
hot
day
beer
o
a
very
dry
nicely
balanced
tart
brew
very
refreshing
great
with
spicy
food
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
galaxy
hut
in
arlington
va
it
poured
a
hazy
goldenhoney
color
with
lots
of
small
bubbles
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
had
notes
of
something
sour
and
wildflowers
the
mouthfeel
is
super
light
and
very
dry
the
taste
is
very
sour
forward
with
notes
of
salt
vinegar
and
fresh
cut
grass
super
refreshing
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
shallow
on
the
flavor
profile
but
well
worth
a
go
o
a
nice
gose
more
on
the
acidic
side
compared
to
a
lot
of
them
pours
golden
from
the
can
with
a
slight
white
head
that
leaves
quickly
very
slight
smell
of
salt
and
spice
the
taste
is
salt
tart
lemon
coriander
and
other
spices
super
refreshing
light
mouth
with
crisp
carbonation
that
is
very
dry
its
exactly
as
described
and
would
be
super
on
a
hot
summer
day
solid
tart
beer
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
overall
easily
available
easy
to
drink
and
just
a
touch
on
the
sour
side
i
find
myself
going
for
this
one
at
bars
when
i
want
to
switch
it
up
from
the
usual
styles
seems
to
be
the
most
readily
available
gose
around
and
not
a
bad
one
at
all
light
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
carbonation
im
going
to
really
enjoy
having
this
regularly
and
recommend
it
my
first
commerciallybrewed
gose
refreshing
opening
very
similar
to
berliner
weisse
but
with
a
bit
more
body
finish
was
satisfying
as
the
salt
countered
the
tartness
well
and
lent
diversity
to
the
experience
this
was
consumed
following
a
mad
chase
of
draft
pours
holiday
bar
closings
and
eventual
nirvana
moment
of
cases
of
cans
in
the
bottle
shop
with
much
anticipation
this
is
a
cool
conundrum
of
a
beer
this
looks
and
smells
like
an
average
lager
based
on
how
i
follow
ratings
i
as
many
others
put
as
much
emphasis
on
appearance
aroma
mouthfeel
etc
as
taste
this
beer
and
maybe
entire
style
deserves
a
bit
more
investigation
golden
straw
colored
brew
with
a
little
bit
of
head
looks
like
lawnmowerville
bit
of
sour
hit
to
the
nose
light
aroma
and
just
a
hint
of
breadyyeasty
goodness
boom
nice
tart
punch
up
front
a
bit
salty
and
such
inspiring
sour
notes
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
ironically
this
would
probably
make
for
a
nice
lawnmower
beer
or
a
sipper
or
anything
for
that
matter
damn
i
need
to
brew
a
gose
when
compared
to
westbrook
av
has
all
of
the
same
funky
salty
deliciousness
though
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
lighter
all
around
love
it
recommend
it
overall
try
it
if
you
were
hesitant
i
am
a
stout
and
ipa
fan
i
like
bold
flavors
i
enjoyed
the
interlude
with
this
beer
its
flavorful
enough
but
crisp
and
one
you
could
drink
a
few
of
without
tiring
quickly
overall
i
have
a
very
hard
time
with
the
gose
style
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
i
have
tried
however
i
think
the
tartness
and
the
fact
that
it
wasnt
completely
100
overwhelming
in
the
salt
department
grainy
wheat
sour
lemon
juice
and
a
salty
aftertaste
this
is
not
terrible
but
it
is
a
style
that
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
the
crack
let
loose
a
squirt
the
likes
of
which
i
have
not
seen
from
an
intact
can
sometimes
if
a
can
is
dented
it
will
push
the
beer
to
the
top
but
in
this
case
the
beer
was
up
to
the
lip
it
must
have
been
overfilled
when
the
lid
was
seamed
on
to
get
it
this
full
a
new
standard
has
been
set
i
began
an
inverted
glug
but
effervescent
was
the
operative
word
here
following
a
brief
pseudocascade
i
got
threeplus
fingers
of
puffy
fizzy
bonewhite
head
that
was
as
carbonated
as
soda
pop
and
lasted
for
just
a
short
time
before
fading
away
color
was
a
palestraw
srm
1
2
and
i
just
urinated
a
darker
liquid
nose
was
tart
yet
salty
i
felt
like
i
was
back
at
sea
smelling
the
breeze
on
the
fantail
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
very
fizzy
the
taste
was
initially
puckeringly
tart
like
sucking
on
a
lemon
but
then
the
saltiness
kicked
in
mellowing
the
intensity
of
the
tartness
finish
was
bone
dry
puckeringly
dry
and
i
could
hear
the
zephyr
winds
blowing
across
the
sahara
desert
as
i
reached
for
my
asthma
inhaler
well
if
you
are
looking
for
something
very
different
or
if
you
really
want
a
thirst
quencher
during
the
summer
months
this
would
be
it
it
was
as
refreshing
as
ginger
ale
but
without
the
sugar
pardon
me
while
i
try
to
prise
my
lips
apart
the
taste
has
a
lovely
tangy
citrus
quality
with
mild
wheat
flavor
light
lemony
tartness
with
mild
wheat
that
gives
a
light
toastiness
w
mild
mineral
aspect
in
the
finish
which
is
dry
and
has
a
slightly
sour
flavor
still
residing
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
wheat
beer
with
a
noticeable
sourness
level
and
quenching
overall
refreshment
factor
i
have
an
affinity
for
this
style
but
in
small
doses
i
wish
smaller
glass
options
were
available
by
the
half
point
i
wanted
something
different
10
oz
is
perfect
no
head
after
a
bit
but
i
think
it
is
a
fine
effort
overall
this
and
the
westbrook
are
the
only
goses
ive
had
and
i
think
this
one
wins
out
slightly
imo
its
less
sour
than
westbrooks
but
also
lacking
the
salt
flavor
the
westbrook
had
i
like
this
as
much
for
the
beer
as
i
do
for
the
packaging
decision
i
am
sick
of
a
bomber
of
gose
its
a
beer
for
sessioning
and
drinking
enormous
quantities
of
in
hot
weather
at
least
it
is
for
me
so
its
always
frustrating
to
spend
upwards
of
ten
bucks
for
a
bottle
i
will
likely
have
to
share
anyway
and
then
move
on
a
nationwide
sixer
of
gose
is
the
ticket
genius
really
and
although
i
know
westbrook
does
it
too
they
dont
come
out
this
way
too
often
the
beer
itself
is
right
on
too
clean
but
really
tart
not
as
salty
as
some
but
that
mouthfeel
and
minerality
are
there
along
with
a
citrusy
kick
thats
new
to
the
style
for
me
and
a
ton
of
carbonation
that
really
makes
it
an
outstanding
refresher
salty
lemon
sort
of
flavor
to
the
finish
acidic
enough
and
just
really
delicious
ice
cold
right
from
the
can
i
see
they
also
did
a
blood
orange
version
of
this
that
i
really
need
to
get
my
hands
on
nicely
tart
slightly
sour
with
a
delicious
bit
of
sweet
this
is
a
gose
with
tempered
salt
theres
a
bit
of
sour
wheat
malt
some
apple
pear
citrus
sweetarts
candy
and
lemon
to
complete
a
relatively
complex
but
lightly
presented
beer
this
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
immensely
sessionable
a
solid
beer
far
more
balanced
and
true
to
style
than
many
other
american
interpretations
of
gose
verry
fruity
and
a
nice
accent
to
a
hazy
hot
and
humid
late
august
afternoon
ooverall
a
nice
example
of
gose
would
have
again
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
amberish
yellow
with
nice
swirling
into
the
glass
pour
finishes
with
a
12
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
me
the
taste
is
wate
boom
sour
the
sour
is
very
present
but
not
the
only
thing
you
taste
really
cant
get
over
how
easy
to
drink
this
one
is
a
32
oz
growler
is
gone
within
a
few
min
good
thing
is
its
also
extremely
light
on
alcohol
so
quenching
your
thirst
shouldnt
kill
you
grainy
lightly
sour
aroma
with
a
hint
of
coriander
softly
floral
a
bit
earthy
and
minerally
flavor
reveals
extremely
tart
then
sour
lemon
character
at
the
forefront
puckering
grain
is
subtle
in
comparison
theres
a
lightly
earthy
finish
far
more
tart
than
most
guess
id
hoped
for
something
less
onenote
lemon
isnt
my
fave
restrained
sourness
with
slight
mineral
water
qualities
thirst
quenching
i
will
be
very
sad
if
this
beer
ever
becomes
unavailable
its
currently
very
easy
to
get
and
one
of
the
only
goses
in
cans
that
i
am
aware
of
another
excellent
summer
beer
or
outside
beer
this
is
a
little
more
dry
sour
than
some
of
my
favorite
goses
rapp
brewing
but
allinall
still
very
good
very
nice
gose
overall
good
beer
that
is
a
little
sweeter
than
other
goses
but
very
good
flavors
and
dry
saltiness
o
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
but
this
is
the
first
ive
ever
had
and
i
hated
my
first
kriek
so
i
may
revisit
this
one
in
a
couple
years
if
i
find
more
of
the
style
prost
probably
the
second
best
americanmade
gose
behind
westbrooks
its
not
nearly
as
mouthpuckeringly
sour
as
the
wb
version
but
still
has
a
nice
acidic
kick
and
a
great
balance
of
malt
wheat
and
sea
salt
pours
a
bit
hazy
almost
amber
golden
color
kicked
up
a
small
head
that
quickly
faded
to
nothing
aroma
is
of
wheat
citrus
and
sour
apple
the
taste
just
reaches
out
and
slaps
you
with
its
lemony
tartness
followed
by
a
bit
of
saltiness
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbles
that
just
make
you
want
to
drink
more
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
ever
drank
i
see
lots
of
them
in
my
future
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
for
its
price
and
incredible
taste
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
very
best
sessionable
beers
out
there
other
breweries
could
certainly
learn
something
from
anderson
valley
with
this
beer
simple
direct
tasty
the
world
could
use
a
few
more
sessionstyle
brews
that
fit
this
description
very
good
beer
o
this
beer
is
all
about
balance
some
other
goses
or
berliner
weisses
go
over
the
top
with
acidic
sourness
or
coriander
but
not
this
one
this
is
my
new
favorite
gose
highly
recommended
3

very
drinkable
refreshing
and
enjoyable
but
the
saltinessmild
sourness
may
not
be
for
everybody
overall
pretty
good
a
little
one
dimensional
but
still
classic
gose
a
good
starter
for
a
gose
not
overall
strong
or
sour
as
the
rustic
ale
dissolves
in
finish
it
does
so
with
the
briny
minerally
and
damp
hay
aftertaste
that
weve
come
to
enjoy
about
authentic
northern
german
gose
its
racy
carbonation
and
bright
vinous
acidity
refreshes
the
palate
at
a
very
high
rate
sip
after
sip
the
beer
is
simply
way
too
easy
12
ounce
can
served
in
a
stange
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
that
stuck
around
a
while
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
tart
lemonlime
green
apples
breadywheat
malt
and
some
salt
i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
mineralness
its
tart
and
refreshing
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
very
easy
to
drink
its
a
good
sessionable
brew
good
thing
i
bought
a
6
pack
of
this
but
i
have
a
feeling
it
isnt
going
to
last
too
long
9
99
a
6pack
overall
i
hope
i
can
still
find
a
sixer
of
these
to
take
up
to
the
lake
before
it
cools
off
this
year
solid
gose
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
by
good
flavors
and
aromas
a
solid
offering
overall
drinkable
for
what
it
is
but
not
a
tremendously
interesting
beer
t
kinda
tastes
like
a
dry
french
cider
sulfur
and
salt
balance
an
astringency
reminiscent
of
orange
pulp
rather
than
harsh
lemon
rind
or
peel
dandelion
with
grassy
notes
lightly
sweet
from
pear
and
apple
lemon
citrus
nice
salty
balance
this
is
my
very
first
gose
and
based
on
this
one
little
can
it
it
one
intriguing
style
of
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
with
good
retention
big
aromas
of
sour
fruit
sour
apple
and
unripened
cherries
and
salty
marshlands
are
dominant
with
a
bit
of
the
wheatiness
detectable
as
well
taste
is
primarily
a
swirl
of
saltiness
and
tart
fruity
notes
like
apricot
and
pear
extremely
dry
finish
the
saltiness
greatly
enhanced
my
enjoyment
of
a
sweet
nectarine
overall
i
dig
this
beer
and
feel
inspired
to
seek
out
new
goses
pours
yellow
gold
with
a
slight
chill
haze
that
falls
off
and
has
a
beautiful
fountain
like
stream
of
effervescence
coming
up
from
the
center
nose
is
a
touch
sweet
with
some
pale
malt
and
hop
floral
light
sweet
flower
petals
the
taste
is
light
crisp
a
bit
tart
and
very
refreshing
this
is
a
gentler
gose
than
the
westbrook
with
not
so
much
sour
that
it
puckers
you
just
enough
tartness
to
whet
the
whistle
and
then
the
saline
aspects
keep
it
whetted
a
touch
malty
as
it
warmed
light
sweet
hoppiness
in
this
one
and
i
really
liked
it
overall
this
is
my
first
gose
its
low
in
alcohol
and
while
its
not
complex
its
still
unique
and
has
lots
of
flavors
whats
cool
is
how
well
the
salt
complements
this
beer
initially
i
was
intrigued
yet
unsure
by
the
thought
of
a
salty
flavor
in
beer
but
after
drinking
this
i
can
see
how
it
works
well
o
an
enjoyable
beer
and
something
i
could
see
myself
buying
again
being
a
cheap
alturnitive
to
the
german
goses
i
can
find
the
saltiness
is
a
little
higher
than
the
german
examples
i
have
tried
and
it
doesnt
have
the
same
balance
a
big
shout
out
to
the
super
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
this
beer
came
gushing
out
of
the
can
despite
no
agitation
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
2
inch
head
smell
is
very
sour
some
salt
as
well
taste
was
not
good
very
sour
tart
lemons
a
bit
salty
as
well
feels
light
and
sour
in
the
mouth
and
while
others
may
like
this
flavor
profile
its
not
for
me
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
one
decent
beer
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
mixing
in
during
a
night
of
drinking
stouts
and
barleywines
definetely
a
shock
after
the
first
sip
but
as
you
get
further
through
the
beer
it
becomes
quite
pleasant
and
refreshing
solid
beer
o
very
refreshing
and
palatecleansing
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
its
not
from
lack
of
flavor
not
sure
how
it
stands
up
to
the
westbrook
offering
but
it
feels
like
its
missing
a
little
something
id
have
to
try
them
side
by
side
to
discern
this
overall
very
balanced
and
im
willing
to
try
again
who
knows
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
if
anyone
else
has
the
same
experience
please
let
me
know
a
very
refreshing
pleasant
beer
tart
and
salty
very
good
after
working
outside
on
a
hot
day
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
tartness
and
funk
followed
by
a
light
sour
mash
scent
which
comes
across
on
the
palate
its
crisp
and
tangy
with
just
a
touch
of
sour
tartness
and
a
drying
salty
brininess
on
the
finish
very
interesting
pours
decent
head
which
goes
away
quite
promptly
the
small
is
a
little
weird
but
when
u
taste
it
is
quite
a
surprise
it
is
a
tangy
beer
with
flavors
of
pepper
citrus
and
an
obvious
taste
of
salti
guess
sea
salt
i
was
a
little
scared
to
try
but
wow
all
of
the
flavors
come
together
and
make
a
great
sparkling
citrusy
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
enjoyable
anytime
especiall
drank
cold
on
a
warm
summer
day
not
like
any
other
but
well
worth
a
try
a
tasty
beer
not
quite
traditional
but
not
far
off
i
particularly
like
the
sea
salt
presence

this
beer
is
just
great
av
cant
produce
enough
of
this
i
wish
theyd
send
some
to
new
mexico
already
i
dont
know
what
the
hang
up
is
there
im
going
to
go
ahead
and
say
i
like
this
better
than
westbrook
gose
and
i
feel
this
is
more
true
to
style
o
outstanding
american
gose
a
real
treat
great
work
avbc
well
im
incredibly
happy
i
tried
this
beer
gose
is
definitely
something
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
as
im
a
fan
of
all
things
sour
that
said
i
think
think
this
is
a
beer
youll
either
love
or
hate
no
in
between
on
this
one
o
nice
to
see
more
of
this
style
coming
around
a
decent
offering
but
definitely
not
up
at
the
top
of
the
list
of
the
very
best
around
worthwhile
getting
to
have
a
light
and
refreshing
drink
for
the
summer
months
12oz
can
pours
a
semi
translucent
pale
yellow
color
with
a
14
inch
of
head
zero
lacing
the
aroma
is
tart
and
funky
with
some
wheat
and
peppery
notes
the
taste
is
lots
of
tart
lemon
upfront
followed
by
some
wheat
and
earth
finishes
with
some
wheat
and
lemon
and
a
hint
of
salt
earthy
at
times
but
mostly
sour
citrus
floral
hints
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
that
puckering
lemon
effect
refreshingly
sour
with
a
low
abv
and
high
drinkability
ideal
summer
beer
overall
pretty
solid
brew
id
grab
again
o
pretty
decent
example
of
the
style
nothing
more
nothing
less
id
like
a
bit
more
salt
and
more
tartness
the
nose
was
disappointing
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
get
a
bready
wheat
beer
luckily
the
flavour
profile
came
through
here
overall
nice
tart
lactic
fruit
with
a
bit
of
salt
one
of
the
better
goses
ive
had
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
overall
zippy
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
i
dig
it
interesting
but
not
something
i
can
say
ive
fallen
in
love
with
if
it
had
a
little
more
character
besides
its
dryness
i
might
be
more
into
it
at
least
its
something
different
than
the
million
or
so
blonde
ales
that
so
many
brewers
are
putting
out
this
time
of
year
o
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
combination
of
tartness
and
brightness
although
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
higher
level
of
saltiness
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
makes
for
a
good
summertime
beverage
i
dont
think
this
will
win
too
many
friends
for
the
style
but
its
certainly
cheap
enough
one
of
the
less
offensive
brews
from
anderson
valley
from
the
12
oz
can
purchased
at
special
brews
in
lynnwood
washington
the
obvious
comparison
is
to
westbrook
gose
this
is
not
as
tart
and
complex
but
arguably
better
balanced
definitely
a
fantastic
summer
beer
overall
even
with
only
about
10
ounces
of
beer
in
this
can
this
still
tasted
pretty
good
i
couldnt
find
anything
on
the
inter
webs
about
any
filling
problems
at
anderson
valley
so
maybe
they
all
are
like
this
those
issues
aside
this
is
a
solid
gose
but
there
are
others
i
would
seek
out
first
bottom
line
darn
good
beer
o
unique
refreshing
and
good
i
may
buy
this
again
if
i
see
it
again
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
pale
hazy
corngold
coloring
with
a
filmy
halo
of
head
and
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
throughout
the
body
nose
of
tart
white
grape
sour
notes
hints
of
sea
salt
toasted
grains
floral
highlights
and
subtle
citrus
notes
flavors
are
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
lemon
zest
and
white
wine
forward
blend
crisp
and
dry
followed
by
a
slightly
sour
and
tart
feel
saltiness
clears
up
into
the
aftertaste
keeping
it
mellow
light
crisp
and
refreshing
the
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
amazingly
drinkable
o
overall
a
fairly
nice
gose
missing
some
of
the
tarty
sweetness
that
you
get
in
the
westbrook
which
i
prefer
but
nonetheless
this
is
a
really
drinkable
and
tasty
gose
glad
to
try
it
anyway
gose
biers
can
go
several
ways
the
balance
of
tartness
is
the
most
important
and
keep
in
mind
im
not
basing
this
on
anything
historical
or
on
any
known
beer
because
there
iswas
no
existing
beer
and
there
was
no
measurement
at
all
for
ph
until
at
least
1909
and
then
it
was
just
getting
started
the
second
part
is
the
saltiness
the
third
is
the
spice
beyond
that
you
have
malt
and
hop
but
its
these
three
things
that
need
to
fall
into
line
to
make
the
beer
work
and
i
think
anderson
valley
has
pulled
that
off
its
salty
then
tart
then
woodyearthyspicy
then
you
repeat
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
depth
to
it
but
it
is
complex
and
refreshing
and
at
only
about
4
2
abv
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
i
want
to
preface
this
review
by
saying
i
have
never
found
myself
being
a
huge
fan
of
the
gose
granted
i
havent
tried
the
westbrook
version
which
i
hear
is
great
but
ive
had
my
fair
share
it
was
a
style
i
just
didnt
get
well
this
beer
changed
my
perspective
on
that
this
is
reviewed
from
a
can
pours
a
clear
gold
with
minimal
head
and
no
retention
the
nose
is
somewhere
between
an
american
wheat
and
a
berliner
weisse
there
is
noteable
wheat
grain
character
that
comes
through
along
with
a
bright
popping
citrus
character
a
bit
of
tangy
lactobacillus
sits
in
the
background
and
just
entices
me
to
take
a
sip
up
front
on
the
palate
you
get
a
wave
of
salt
this
was
the
part
that
didnt
make
sense
to
me
in
the
style
well
now
it
does
the
salt
in
this
brew
is
very
noticeable
and
almost
takes
on
the
taste
of
salt
water
for
a
split
second
this
quickly
gives
way
to
a
dash
of
tartness
and
then
a
big
zesty
lemony
character
at
the
finish
the
saltcitrustartness
makes
for
an
incredibly
harmonious
and
refreshing
combination
that
is
incredibly
quenching
especially
during
some
of
these
hot
summer
days
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
spritzy
overall
this
is
a
great
bbqsummersession
brew
forget
those
session
ipas
they
arent
bad
just
not
my
favorite
trend
i
think
these
are
due
to
catch
on
and
catch
fire
in
the
craft
beer
world
its
clean
like
my
baby
mama
out
of
the
wash
but
when
i
walk
by
the
bathroom
right
after
i
am
greeted
with
those
fruity
flavors
ay
now
raul
wouldnt
call
this
thang
fruity
but
the
wheat
and
sour
qualities
arent
exactly
making
him
excited
again
its
not
bad
but
a
bit
more
bite
and
salt
would
make
raul
want
to
holla
for
another
but
as
for
now
it
is
one
and
done
overall
really
nice
refreshing
and
affordable
gose
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
the
body
was
medium
with
a
nice
crispness
drinkability
was
good
my
can
went
away
quickly
and
another
is
ready
to
in
the
glass
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
not
notable
but
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
overall
a
solid
sessionable
gose
really
appreciate
the
creativity
in
this
one
i
have
had
better
in
the
style
that
have
the
salt
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
wish
i
would
have
gotten
a
six
pack
of
well
this
certainly
is
salty
so
that
is
certainly
covered
definitely
tart
and
sour
so
thats
covered
but
its
all
kind
of
one
dimensional
not
really
interesting
or
overly
complex
i
guess
im
jaded
because
ive
had
the
westbrook
gose
decent
but
i
wouldnt
go
for
it
again
cheers
to
an
american
brewery
for
doing
a
gose
style
beer
this
was
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
and
i
have
to
say
i
am
a
big
fan
i
was
put
off
initially
by
the
poor
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
outstanding
by
the
end
of
the
beer
the
head
had
completely
disappeared
and
it
transformed
into
something
that
resembled
a
gueuze
lambic
if
youre
into
sour
beers
dont
hesitate
to
give
this
one
a
whirl
slightly
hazed
golden
body
with
bright
white
head
forming
thick
fine
speckled
lacing
around
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
sharp
citric
wheat
notes
acidity
evident
even
in
the
nose
you
can
pick
up
a
touch
of
lactic
acid
tartness
in
a
really
tart
yogurt
or
light
note
of
apple
cider
vinegar
is
available
in
the
nares
flavor
a
mix
of
tart
cider
citric
lemon
notes
lactic
acid
found
in
greek
yogurt
finishes
with
an
approachable
level
of
brine
saltiness
finishes
bone
dry
amongst
all
the
tart
and
salty
characters
being
tossed
around
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
the
lingering
salt
and
lactic
acid
tartness
really
dries
that
palate
out
im
talking
a
salty
dry
quality
that
makes
it
down
the
back
of
your
throat
overall
a
solid
canned
gose
in
the
us
of
a
pretty
cool
to
know
that
theres
more
adventurous
brewers
like
westbrook
and
anderson
valley
willing
to
do
just
that
overall
a
nice
raggedy
gose
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
wisps
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
tart
with
malt
wheat
spice
and
salt
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
wheat
spice
and
salt
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
picked
this
up
when
i
saw
it
because
it
is
hard
to
find
a
gose
hoped
it
could
measure
up
to
lost
nation
gose
not
a
great
appearance
kinda
light
with
a
decent
head
smell
is
actually
bad
not
something
that
gets
you
going
for
the
beer
but
the
taste
is
excellent
sour
and
tart
and
even
a
little
sweet
you
notice
the
salt
but
it
is
faint
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
saltiness
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
as
i
had
this
in
the
heat
on
a
boat
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
finally
a
gose
that
i
may
be
able
to
buy
with
some
regularity
looks
pissyellow
but
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
slightly
hazy
the
head
is
white
and
effervescent
and
fades
quickly
it
smells
a
bit
uninteresting
but
im
in
a
smelly
bar
sooo
anyways
the
taste
shines
nice
and
tart
peach
skin
is
a
dominant
flavor
underripe
peaches
a
bit
of
wheatiness
grape
skins
very
effervescent
thirst
quenching
this
is
a
summer
beer
to
me
forget
over
sweet
witbiers
this
and
berliner
weisses
are
beers
id
like
to
see
more
often
in
america
a
solid
gose
but
its
a
little
heavier
on
the
sourtartness
than
the
others
i
think
its
well
done
but
some
of
the
others
out
there
i
prefer
more
anderson
valley
the
kimmie
the
yink
the
holy
gose
ale
45
this
gose
is
very
salty
very
refreshing
and
very
crisp
it
starts
out
tart
but
gives
way
to
a
salty
slightly
dry
but
refreshing
delight
the
beer
has
a
medium
creamy
feel
which
balances
out
the
saltiness
in
a
good
way
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
saltiness
does
not
become
fatiguing
on
the
palate
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
ill
seek
out
more
oa
tart
gose
in
a
six
pack
of
cans
that
isnt
ridiculously
pricey
so
goddamn
cool
very
happy
with
this
beer
i
will
definitely
make
this
a
steady
contributor
in
my
fridge
this
summer
very
well
done
both
in
the
beers
packaging
format
and
the
overall
product
as
well
i
continue
to
grab
this
at
a
local
bar
as
gose
and
sour
dont
always
occupy
a
tap
and
i
enjoy
this
as
a
go
to
for
an
enjoyable
break
from
other
styles
o
overall
light
tangy
and
delightful
once
you
get
over
the
initial
shock
of
it
not
at
all
like
the
other
gose
i
have
had
but
probably
a
little
more
enjoyable
salty
and
tangy
although
slightly
like
a
watered
down
salty
saison
o
this
is
a
very
uneven
beer
it
has
its
good
qualities
but
needed
to
be
pushed
even
further
than
it
was
overall
im
a
fan
of
this
one
and
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
sour
beers
great
sour
wheat
base
with
a
dose
of
saltiness
gotta
love
when
a
random
new
gose
shows
up
at
your
local
in
a
canned
sixpack
sweet
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
sharp
lemon
zest
light
lemongrass
and
a
touch
of
ginger
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
lemon
bringing
a
nice
tartness
a
bit
of
cracked
wheat
finds
its
way
in
there
as
well
for
once
no
real
salt
character
is
present
though
a
general
mineral
quality
pervades
the
tartness
both
cutting
and
bolstering
it
in
turn
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
solid
little
refresher
something
i
hope
comes
around
at
least
annually
o
very
enjoyable
and
it
has
a
nice
winelike
quality
that
several
wine
drinkers
i
know
enjoyed
good
flavors
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
definitely
worth
grabbing
if
you
are
not
in
the
distribution
area
of
westbrooks
gose
overall
3
75
i
really
enjoy
this
at
first
it
doesnt
seem
that
complex
because
the
citric
lactic
tang
dominates
the
mid
and
the
back
of
the
palate
but
the
salty
and
subtly
sweet
grainy
notes
add
depth
that
complements
the
sour
extremely
well
its
so
crisp
and
drinkable
its
kind
of
like
the
zany
cousin
of
a
really
good
cream
aleaal
which
i
love
in
this
weather
as
it
is
i
would
happily
session
the
crap
out
of
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
with
bleached
white
big
fluffy
head
settles
quickly
down
to
a
thin
ring
a
few
dots
on
the
glass
smell
pale
malt
a
little
tangy
smelling
mildly
earthy
taste
lemon
wedge
tart
white
grape
then
a
pop
of
salt
lactic
into
a
mild
earthy
finish
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
nice
midsip
carbonation
hit
that
leads
into
a
mildly
tart
juicyish
finish
tasty
and
refreshing
nice
not
must
have
this
is
a
refreshing
offering
but
nothing
that
anyone
should
get
terribly
jazzed
up
about
o
very
refreshing

overall
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
gose
this
is
a
pretty
solid
one
overall
this
tastes
ironically
way
too
much
like
cider
that
unfortunately
doesnt
do
it
for
me
while
being
ok
otherwise
but
i
would
pass
this
up
again
on
the
store
isle
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
an
initially
tall
creamy
head
that
fizzles
to
nothing
spiced
tart
lemon
light
white
wine
and
a
sort
of
mineral
element
in
the
nose
refreshingly
tart
flavor
lots
of
lemon
mild
coriander
peach
and
some
saltiness
in
the
finish
pretty
bone
dry
and
very
refreshing
this
will
be
excellent
for
sitting
poolside
and
at
the
beach
this
summer
overall
great
take
on
the
style
much
more
approachable
that
wb
i
prefer
the
extremes
of
westbrook
but
this
will
definitely
hold
me
through
o
my
first
in
this
style
and
i
really
liked
it
heres
to
more
taste
is
much
cleaner
and
more
enjoyable
tart
and
lemony
it
has
a
snappy
lactobacillus
clean
tartness
with
a
saline
presence
towards
the
end
finish
is
bone
dry
light
and
airy
feel
with
enough
champagne
carbonation
to
carry
it
along
overall
this
is
a
good
gose
maybe
not
especially
nuanced
or
sweet
smelling
but
it
hits
all
the
notes
for
me
otherwise
this
will
never
be
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
ovearall
great
gose
overall
good
if
you
want
a
gose
but
not
on
westbrooks
level
gose
arrives
at

in
calgary
and
obviously
one
has
to
try
this

the
entire

which
scrambled
the
servers
brain
she
was
awesome
by
the
way
whaaa
oh
the

done
arrived
in
a
pint
glass
an
exceedingly
pale
straw
color
like
many
commercial
lagers
with
a
stippling
of
white
foam
on
top
smells
vinous
a
white
wine
boozy
quality
tannic
and
tart
with
some
cidery
apple
cellar
must
and
tart
lemon
adding
to
the
olfactory
impression
taste
was
predictably
sour
and
salty
cider
vinegar
or
old
wine
coriander
husk
pedestrian
wheat
malt
spice
and
lemon
rind
with
a
briny
sea
salt
foundation
i
detect
some
other
fruit
that
i
cannot
pinpoint
more
specifically
thin
to
medium
body
like
many
summer
wheat
ales
and
fairly
aggressive
carbonation
perhaps
this
style
is
not
really
my
bag
i
find
the
salt
overpowering
here
and
the
whole
package
to
be
vinegar
sour
but
without
any
appreciable
yeasty
funk
or
other
flavors
to
provide
balance
its
compelling
but
maybe
not
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
will
try
another
gose
soon
to
assess
variation
in
the

to

5another
one
of
those
styles
o
very
bland
tasting
beer
especially
after
i
cracked
a
westbrook
gose
to
drink
side
by
side
with
this
no
sourness
or
saltiness
to
it
and
the
lack
of
truffle
flavours
was
fairly
disappointing
o
sweet
and
creamy
a
nice
drinker
and
not
as
crisp
as
the
normal
gose
pour
is
lighter
golden
amber
with
a
fairly
tight
white
head
with
some
larger
bubbles
nose
is
light
salt
up
front
a
hint
of
grain
strong
citrus
behind
taste
is
similar
a
bit
of
earthiness
to
it
fair
touch
of
salt
faint
hint
of
grain
tons
of
citrus
behind
body
is
a
touch
of
oil
softer
carb
and
creamy
feel
overall
the
truffle
flavor
just
wasnt
there
but
a
good
summer
beer
nonetheless
overall
a
nice
gentle
enjoyable
beer
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
as
anything
exceptional
i
expected
it
to
at
least
be
extremely
different
given
that
ive
never
had
either
a
gose
or
a
beer
brewed
with
white
truffles
but
its
not
really
all
that
different
the
palate
opens
with
a
touch
of
earth
a
mild
saltiness
and
a
brightening
coriander
note
a
touch
of
earthy
funk
is
also
present
as
with
the
base
beer
the
salt
levels
are
low
but
completely
appropriate
and
extremely
refreshing
light
in
body
with
a
drying
snappy
finish
maybe
a
touch
watery
carbonation
is
crisp
awesome
stuff
this
is
not
an
in
your
face
beer
uniquely
american
but
european
in
aim
i
think
this
is
my
top
two
all
time
favorite
gose
after
westbrook
but
theyre
very
different
from
each
other
westbrook
is
more
traditional
in
aim
and
cleaner
with
a
more
watery
texture
the
salt
in
the
westbrook
gose
is
also
much
more
prominent
which
is
not
very
traditional
this
is
maybe
a
top
10
all
time
favorite
beer
overall

my

the
great

metropolis
of
portland
or
overall
really
unique
gose
but
super
enjoyable
earthy
back
end
really
sets
it
apart
tartness
is
present
yet
not
overdone
upright
isnt
afraid
to
be
different
and
this
is
another
great
example
o
a
very
fun
and
well
made
beer
light
and
refreshing
with
subtle
complexities
given
the
opportunity
i
could
easily
drink
several
liters
of
this
overall
good
but
not
different
enough
to
stand
out
imo
not
for
me
my
wife
loved
it
o
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
the
perfect
accompaniment
to
any
summertime
meal
flavors
of
wheat
coriander
salt
cheese
rind
definitely
a
smooth
savory
feel
from
the
noticeable
salt
addition
slight
tang
but
not
really
tart
smooth
supple
feel
light
but
with
a
moreish
savory
quality
very
quenching
and
drinkable
but
it
could
use
a
little
more
zip
true
to
style
and
worth
a
try
dope
label
dont
have
much
for
traditional
german

to
do
hazy

body
foamy
white

with
basically
no
lace
bread
lemon
honey
corriander
salty
mineraly
finish
not
a
style
im
in
love
with
but
a
nice
representation
drinkability
is
good
a
quenching
goose
but
not
very
flavorful
worth
trying
not
necessarily
seeking
out
ultimately
this
gose
is
undersalted
underspiced
and
lacks
in
funk
and
acidity
but
manages
to
stand
up
on
its
own
feet
simply
because
it
is
supremely
wellcrafted
highly
recommended
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
tingly
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
it
is
like
a
savory
witbier
with
a
dirty
little
mineral
addition
it
was
ok
but
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
or
expecting
from
this
brewery
that
i
hold
to
high
regard
this
was
not
something
i
would
buy
again

well

looking

to
trying
more
beers
from
this
brewer
o
light
crisp
clean
and
damn
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
enjoy
a
perfect
beer
for
summertime
this
was
my
first
venture
in
the
gose
style
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
them
if
they
are
like
this
big
thanks
goes
out
to
msquared2
for
sharing
this
one
at
our
labor
day
tasting
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
golden
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
fruit
salt
wheat
and
subtle
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
sour
salt
earth
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
great
brew
gose
you
say
lets
do
this
i
had
heard
good
things
about
this
brew
so
i
was
quite
happy
to
see
it
make
an
appearance
at
our
tasting
i
had
heard
correct
as
this
was
a
really
well
done
brew
in
all
aspects
wish
there
was
a
little
more
carbonation
though
the
flavor
and
aroma
were
almost
perfect
in
my
opinion
all
the
right
notes
for
the
style
and
none
of
the
drawbacks
the
saltiness
was
there
in
both
but
it
didnt
pound
your
face
into
submission
and
leave
your
palate
screaming
for
mercy
which
was
very
nice
the
sourtart
note
definitely
helped
to
pull
this
one
off
a
really
well
done
brew
by
upright
that
i
would
love
to
have
more
of
in
the
future
thanks
so
much
for
sharing
this
one
morgan
as
it
is
currently
my
favorite
from
this
style
overall
i
would
have
this
one
again
light
and
crisp
enough
salt
to
taste
it
but
it
didnt
dominate
all
the
other
flavors
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
spice
taste
is
much
the
same
with
the
spices
lingering
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
really
go
for
again
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
tart
lemon
on
the
nose
with
lemon
zest
and
a
subtle
saltiness
some
straw
bread
and
lots
of
yeast
on
the
nose
too
really
pleasant
aroma
the
flavor
is
just
as
enjoyable
a
bit
more
tart
than
other
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
mild
coriander
and
salt
notes
with
lots
of
lemon
zest
yeast
and
cracker
malts
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
o
really
cool
beer
from
upright
that
i
enjoyed
lots
of
different
things
going
on
between
the
nose
and
palate
that
kept
me
thinking
more
and
more
about
what
i
was
getting
out
of
it
would
like
to
have
this
again
for
sure
to
see
if
anything
has
changed
down
the
road
o
funky
but
not
the
most
drinkable
its
my
first
of
the
style
though
so
maybe
the
style
just
isnt
for
me
o
my
first
tango
with
a
gose
went
pretty
well
but
i
can
see
this
style
being
hit
or
miss
i
really
like
the
briny
salt
character
of
the
style
and
hopefully
i
can
try
some
similar
ones
in
the
future
a
tasty
little
brew
from
upright
pours
pale
yellow
and
cloudy
with
a
big
white
head
the
head
is
pretty
fizzy
and
fades
to
nothing
quickly
the
aroma
is
subdued
particularly
in
terms
of
the
characteristic
gose
elements
its
mostly
wheat
spice
and
malt
sweetness
theres
some
mild
coriander
spicing
and
a
touch
of
lactic
acid
in
the
mix
maybe
a
little
lemon
but
less
than
i
expect
and
want
in
the
style
the
taste
is
similar
it
tastes
like
their
witbier
with
a
little
bit
of
gose
blended
in
theres
a
little
bit
of
salt
and
lactic
sourness
but
this
is
a
very
mild
version
of
the
style
its
moderately
dry
though
id
call
it
relatively
sweet
for
the
style
its
quite
clean
too
clean
really
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
little
to
no
pucker
overall
its
a
decent
enough
beer
though
a
touch
boring
i
just
cant
help
feeling
disappointed
since
i
like
the
spice
salt
and
sour
of
the
style
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
only
other
gose
ive
had
was
the
one
from
portsmouth
uprights
seems
more
like
a
saison
than
a
gose
but
i
still
really
enjoyed
it
the
beer
was
salty
but
not
as
intense
as
i
would
have
expected
it
to
be
pours
a
hazy
hayyellow
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
smells
very
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
with
that
clove
banana
aroma
looking
forward
to
tasting
this
one
flavor
is
very
nice
and
refreshing
a
bit
like
a
lighter
hefeweizen
there
are
hints
of
salt
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
bubbly
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
but
i
guess
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
little
more
exciting
given
my
love
for
upright
and
my
interest
in
this
style
still
its
a
very
good
gose
and
another
hit
from
upright
im
very
glad
to
have
tried
this
beer
i
can
see
from
this
that
a
gose
is
a
cross
between
a
saison
a
hefeweizen
and
a
berliner
weisse
this
was
tasty
id
love
to
try
another
version
especially
a
germanmade
one

would
like
to
grab
more
from
upright
if
i
get
the
chance
highly
recommend
a
nice
tart
and
refreshing
gose
the
carbonation
is

d
much

than

all
of

with
maybe
the
exception
of
the
ccb
gose
overall
considerably
more

than
the

o

here
quite
a
nice
gose
rated
with
style
in
mind
ive
only
had
limited
experience
in
this
style
but
this
seemed
to
do
the
trick
bottle
from
private
beer
store
in
vancouver
pours
hazy
orange
and
is
lacey
some
funk
and
sour
in
aroma
initially
the
sourness
hits
then
the
yeast
and
the
very
saltines
ultimately
sour
salt
water
sweet
corriander
drinkable
for
a
glass
but
a
pint
is
impossible
to
put
down
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
especially
since
we
drank
it
on
a
90
degree
summer
day
really
light
and
easy
to
drink
would
activily
seek
this
one
out
again
thanks
michael
definitely
an
interesting
beer
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
had
expected
from
a
gose
but
it
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
it
honestly
tastes
more
like
a
variation
of
an
upright
saison
than
anything
which
certainly
makes
sense
given
its
pedigree
this
should
definitely
be
drunk
on
the
cool
side
as
opposed
to
the
cold
side
as
it
opens
up
quite
a
bit
more
in
the
50s
and
60s
on
the
fahrenheit
scale
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
take
and
a
fairly
rare
style
of
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
away
almost
completely
smell
is
very
light
some
lemon
or
orange
to
me
smells
much
like
a
standard
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
so
surprising
and
delicious
some
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
a
delightful
tart
light
sour
finish
just
the
slightest
hint
of
the
salt
which
brings
out
all
the
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
tart
finish
this
is
the
first
gose
i
have
ever
had
and
i
now
wish
that
they
were
more
readily
available
a
great
beer
overall
im
quite
impressed
i
hope
im
able
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
or
ten
also
i
just
burped
and
it
tasted
good
this
pours
a
cloudy
whee
yelloworange
color
a
small
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
of
lemon
and
wheat
small
amounts
of
herbal
scents
and
malts
taste
is
a
light
zesty
lemon
sour
crossed
with
a
wheat
beer
nice
sour
right
up
front
that
is
noticeable
all
the
way
through
but
the
finish
there
is
also
a
light
grain
that
balances
out
the
beer
nicely
nothing
salty
or
no
salt
aspect
on
this
one
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
medium
bodied
it
is
bubbly
with
the
first
sip
but
defiantly
has
a
little
weight
in
the
body
i
think
this
is
great
especially
for
a
summer
day
my
first
gose
and
something
i
was
definitely
a
fan
of
a
really
nice
warmweather
beer
d
very
light
and
refreshing
even
thought
some
of
the
flavors
noted
can
be
fatiguing
they
are
quite
the
opposite
in
this
beer
and
you
could
certainly
have
a
lot
of
it
would
drink
again
if
it
were
made
in
large
quantities
nice
to
see
more
breweries
trying
their
hand
at
this
style
albeit
with
mixed
results
cough
bruery
cough
o
a
great
light
summer
sipper
i
like
the
mild
acidity
and
refreshing
complexity
of
this
brew
the
label
art
is
tasteful
as
well
if
that
counts
for
anything
o
the
upright
boys
just
keep
making
better
beer
all
the
time
this
is
proof
4
55
overall
i
believe
this
is
only
the
second
beer
of
the
style
ive
had
but
once
again
im
impressed
an
interesting
beer
that
doesnt
differ
much
from
a
saison
well
worth
a
shot
hey
i
get
to
try
another
gose
no
way
it
pours
a
cloudy
golden
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
lightly
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
coriander
orange
peel
wheat
and
lovely
flowers
trust
me
they
smell
like
they
would
look
pretty
pretty
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
coriander
salt
wheat
very
light
sour
malt
grass
and
those
goodlookin
flowers
again
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
dry
finish
overall
a
very
enjoyable
lil
drink
something
i
wish
more
breweries
would
dabble
in
especially
if
it
turns
out
as
well
as
it
did
here
the
appearance
of
this
beer
not
knowing
much
about
the
style
is
a
tad
unappetizing
it
pours
like
a
cloudy
champagne
color
and
fizzes
just
like
it
too
the
aroma
is
like
tart
lemons
with
the
coriander
in
place
with
a
slight
sour
nose
and
a
decent
aroma
of
pilsner
malt
the
flavor
is
actually
pretty
darn
good
there
is
a
touch
of
funk
the
slightest
of
saltiness
decent
wheat
flavor
and
a
good
deal
of
fizzy
lemons
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
like
this
style
but
i
must
admit
ive
taken
quite
a
shine
to
it
i
found
the
sourness
to
be
quite
mild
and
overall
the
extreme
fizz
seemed
to
really
help
the
fruity
notes
of
the
beer
come
through
overall
if
youre
going
to
make
an
attempt
at
the
style
there
seems
like
no
better
beer
to
do
that
with
then
the
upright
gose
d
very
good
nice
and
refreshing
d
tasty
and
unique
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
and
would
happily
drink
it
again
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
a
nice
twofinger
white
head
with
a
moderate
amount
of
retention
the
nose
brings
some
nice
citrus
and
lemon
notes
with
a
slight
sourness
to
it
the
flavor
is
lemon
with
some
mild
acidity
and
a
touch
of
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
where
this
really
shines
good
body
and
the
salt
is
actually
a
pleasant
addition
rather
than
something
id
simply
tolerate
because
its
part
of
the
style
this
was
a
highquality
brew
thanks
matt
i
liked
this
beer
considerably
more
than
the
3
other
people
that
shared
it
with
me
but
i
dont
care
it
is
bright
on
the
palate
and
creamy
with
a
thin
body
but
a
wet
finish
it
is
mildly
salty
but
that
accents
the
citric
acid
of
this
so
well
even
if
the
lactic
is
what
wins
out
the
two
acids
are
nicely
complementary
and
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
is
very
nice
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
much
better
than
leipziger
gose
d
this
is
a
great
style
it
is
very
refreshing
and
way
drinkable
it
is
just
too
bad
that
it
is
such
a
rarely
seen
style
too
all
appearances
this
beer
is
a
wheat
beer
but
after
a
sip
or
two
the
salt
shows
up
in
the
mouthfeel
it
is
an
interesting
beer
which
works
well
with
plain
food
i
liked
it
but
did
find
the
salt
was
noticeable
on
the
gums
after
awhile
nice
however
to
see
this
old
style
available
in
bc
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
some
tart
wheat
with
some
lemons
bananas
and
salt
the
flavor
is
similar
i
get
notes
of
lemons
wheat
and
some
salt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
very
light
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
very
easily
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
very
refreshing
definitely
a
nice
gose
great
for
the
summer
thanks
eric
d
really
good
see
the
last
sentence
of
mouthfeel
as
to
why
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
perhaps
a
onetime
release
or
perhaps
a
repeat
performance
by
the
fine
fellows
at
upright
not
the
best
ive
had
but
certainly
fine
enough
to
seek
out
and
a
perfect
spring
beer
despite
a
january
release
thanks
to
eric
for
sharing
this
one
a
wonderfully
refreshing
summer
beer
and
a
nicely
made
gose
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
gose
ive
only
had
the
leipziger
and
this
is
certainly
an
american
take
on
it
but
it
is
comparable
in
overall
quality
my
wife
found
this
a
tad
more
flavorful
and
enjoyable
than
i
did
certainly
worth
seeking
out
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
experience
a
gose
beer
a
cool
label
to
boot
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
and
was
left
wondering
why
more
brewers
dont
attempt
the
style
refreshing
and
light
interesting
and
flavorful
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
this
regularly
in
the
summer
love
that
light
pinch
as
the
tartness
hits
the
mouth
i
am
guessing
this
is
not
quite
like
a
typical
gose
as
it
seems
more
belgian
than
german
salt
comes
through
very
nicely
and
makes
the
body
creamy
and
full
lacto
plays
tricks
with
the
salt
and
comes
across
as
less
sour
than
it
might
normally
coriander
is
there
as
is
some
wheat
tang
it
is
kinda
like
a
witsaisonberlinerweissbier
nice
but
not
as
tart
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
believe
this
probably
used
a
saison
yeast
as
opposed
to
a
more
traditional
german
varietal
still
i
am
loving
this
beer
and
would
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
for
sure
a
wonderful
drinking
experience
thanks
again

nice
but
im
not
sure
what
to
measure
it
against
i
guess
anything
gose
drinkability
refreshing
but
the
carbonation
is
excessive
the
body
and
drinkability
were
both
good
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
on
a
summers
afternoon
overall
a
good
beer
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
i
enjoy
this
style
i
think
upright
did
it
right
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
beer
through
the
spring
and
summer
months
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
a
lower
moderate
level
of
carbonation
i
think
an
increased
level
of
carbonation
would
make
this
more
enjoyable
but
in
its
current
form
its
damn
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
750ml
was
depleted
with
no
great
effort
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
upright
offerings
in
the
future
d
a
perfect
example
of
a
summertime
thirst
quencher
right
up
there
with
berliner
weisse
witbier
etc
they
should
make
this
by
the
gallon
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
20
degrees
out
right
now
at
5
2
quite
drinkable
especially
given
its
lack
of
any
bittering
and
nice
maltiness
would
gladly
pick
this
up
again
when
its
out
in
bottle
overall
complex
creative
and
impressive
sour
pineapple
juice
lemon
zest
yogurt
bottle
pours
hazy
yellow
with
white
head
light
fruity
and
salty
aroma
taste
is
tropical
fruits
brett
funk
and
a
tart
and
light
salty
finish
excellent
oh
my
seek
this
brew
out
nothing
short
of
amazing
best
beer
collaboration
ever
i
wish
i
had
a
case
of
this
instead
of
just
one
this
is
amazing
such
a
puckery
experience
as
if
the
regular
westbrook
gose
could
get
any
better
well
it
did
the
addition
of
brett
to
the
mix
t
play
with
the
lacto
is
really
what
makes
this
different
its
pale
yellow
and
hazy
in
its
look
very
heady
with
a
ton
of
sediment
in
there
too
the
nose
and
taste
are
both
tangy
more
like
the
gozu
on
the
fruitiness
than
anything
else
the
saltiness
is
there
too
clean
though
for
its
yeasty
look
and
really
really
dry
and
brightly
carbonated
the
funk
of
the
brett
adds
a
layer
to
the
sourness
of
the
lacto
and
the
result
is
splendid
the
fruitiness
has
a
grapefruit
character
maybe
from
some
hops
you
dont
usually
see
hoppy
gose
its
also
got
a
peachy
creamy
thing
going
on
which
really
works
in
the
style
this
is
easily
the
most
evolved
example
of
a
gose
i
have
ever
had
wild
yeasts
on
both
the
hot
and
cold
side
which
make
this
all
the
more
interesting
from
a
process
standpoint
thanks
to
drlovemd87
for
sharing
this
with
me
what
a
treat
perhaps
this
is
the
most
refreshing
beer
ever
made
i
always
said
we
needed
more
pornish
references
in
beer
names
but
i
think
we
can
do
better
than
sophomoric
softcore
garbage
from
florida
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweettart
lemon
ruby
red
grapefruit
juice
and
a
hint
of
almost
peatlike
phenols
in
the
background
not
unlike
an
islay
scotch
the
taste
continues
the
sweettart
lemon
tradition
bolder
now
nearly
bleeding
into
a
wellsculpted
version
of
country
time
in
a
good
way
backed
up
by
what
is
now
clearly
a
briny
character
again
much
like
certain
islay
scotches
and
boyhowdy
does
it
work
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
this
was
a
decidedly
enjoyable
beer
my
favorite
of
the
day
the
slightlyincreased
heft
allows
the
tartness
and
brine
to
dance
their
lovely
dance
longer
on
the
tongue
allowing
more
of
the
spectators
ie
my
tastebuds
to
recognize
the
quality
of
their
motions
good
times
indeed
this
flavor
is
sublime
as
a
nicely
tempered
sourness
glides
across
the
palate
the
taste
has
a
pulpy
natural
grapefruit
tangy
nectarine
fruity
apricot
and
a
bit
of
earthy
mineral
this
does
have
little
to
no
saltiness
which
will
make
some
very
happy
but
instead
highlights
a
very
real
tangy
tart
and
sweet
an
extremely
balanced
brew
less
tart
and
salt
than
westbrooks
classic
but
a
beautiful
balanced
mouthfeel
and
hoppy
notes
towards
the
quality
of
funky
buddhas

tried
this
on

hazy

and
bready
the
beer
is
pretty
sour
tasting
but
is
balanced
well
by
a
sharp
bready
taste
sort
of
like
sour
dough
oone
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
extra
citrus
and
hops
really
adds
extra
layers
to
the
gose
this
beer
just
did
not
work
for
me
too
much
going
on
some
styles
just
simply
do
not
need
a
huge
dose
of
high
alpha
acids
and
this
is
one
of
them
finishes
dry
and
spicy
with
touches
of
sour

this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
definitely
the
most
interesting
gose
ive
had
to
date
the
hops
were
not
quite
as
strong
as
i
was
expecting
so
i
wish
i
had
another
to
cellar
for
a
bit
and
see
where
it
goes
overall
i
wish
every
beer
could
be
as
flavorful
as
this
at
such
a
low
abv
oone
of
the
coolest
most
unique
beers
i
have
come
across
probably
wont
see
this
one
again
so
i
am
very
very
happy
i
got
to
immerse
myself
into
a
full
pint
of
this
tasty
collaboration
o
great
beer
love
the
huge
tartness
and
some
great
balancing
flavors
as
well
i
think
i
slightly
prefer
the
regular
westbrook
gose
but
both
are
excellent
o
a
nice
sour
that
seems
a
bit
more
complex
than
most
gose
would
love
to
see
how
this
one
ages
pours
a
pale
almost
banana
yellow
very
cloudy
medium
white
head
all
fine
foam
little
lacing
but
it
could
be
the
glass
aroma
is
odd
i
think
its
a
mix
of
hops
lacto
and
spice
but
its
hard
to
separate
things
out
i
like
it
but
the
initial
smell
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
kinda
pickley
strong
yogurt
sour
note
with
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
taste
is
quite
lacto
sour
big
tropical
hop
flavor
some
butyric
acid
a
tad
off
putting
lots
of
pucker
a
bit
of
yogurty
body
and
otherwise
light
very
interesting
but
i
cant
say
that
i
love
it
overall
i
love
this
beer
while
its
a
far
cry
from
a
traditional
gose
if
ritterguts
andor
leipziger
are
to
be
taken
as
examples
its
so
deliciously
different
the
taste
is
really
what
makes
this
beer
and
i
would
encourage
anyone
who
loves
sourtasting
beers
in
general
or
pickled
foods
to
check
it
out
stillwater
and
westbrook
have
created
something
truly
unique
and
amazing
plenty
of
funk
in
this
beer
and
it
is
absolutely
delicious
dry
finish
and
a
lingering
tart
bite
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
lovely
opleasantly
surprised
im
really
digging
this
beer
overall
what
an
interesting
beer
very
sour
and
drinkable
with
a
nice
blend
of
sour
citrus
herbaceous
hops
and
brett
funk
pour
is
hazed
pale
yellow
with
a
good
bit
of
white
head
and
some
larger
bubbles
nose
is
quite
hoppy
lots
of
citrus
and
citra
hops
with
a
light
tinge
of
salt
and
a
dose
of
acidity
taste
is
similar
tons
of
citra
hop
a
bit
of
acidity
and
moderate
grain
presence
lots
of
citrusy
flavors
and
just
a
hint
of
saltiness
lighter
carb
with
a
juicy
finish
ohighly
drinkable
nice
delicious
blend
of
taste
and
traits
though
many
of
the
classic
gose
are
long
gone
comparisons
to
american
attempts
are
few
and
far
between
but
with
recent
brewing
advancements
in
place
gose
gone
wild
doesnt
only
compare
favorably
it
likely
surpasses
many
of
them
in
quality
and
crispness
o
this
is
even
better
than
wb
gose
it
is
more
sour
and
less
salty
this
one
is
amazing
stillwaters
remixes
the
ones
ive
tried
are
all
really
cool
beers
overall
pretty
fantastic
similar
to
the
regular
westbrook
gose
o
this
is
amazing
just
doesnt
taste
like
other
other
goses
or
fit
to
style
i
have
not
tried
westbrook
gose
and
based
on
how
good
this
is
i
need
to
try
it
i
cant
wait
to
get
more
of
this
hazy
straw
small
white
head
aroma
is
lightly
sour
and
musty
hay
flavor
is
extremely
acetic
limey
tart
lemony
sour
with
a
slightly
floral
lightly
bready
backbone
way
more
tart
than
expected
and
i
like
it
becomes
almost
grapefruity
after
a
few
sips
definitely
more
of
a
sour
than
a
gose
but
its
squeaky
clean
the
extreme
sourness
masks
subtle
nuances
o
a
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
overall
not
terribly
complex
but
thoroughly
enjoyable
this
is
by
far
the
nicest
gose
style
beer
i
have
tried
o
really
tasty
beer
the
combination
of
different
acids
from
the
hops
and
brettlacto
gives
it
an
almost
acetic
quality
although
not
overbearing
o
unique
and
fascinating
i
really
enjoy
it
but
its
probably
not
for
everyone
would
have
again
i
try
to
always
give
some
sort
of
recommendation
and
for
this
i
will
say
that
you
must
have
it
overall
super
impressive
and
tasty
one
of
the
best
o
this
is
one
of
the
most
unusual
goses
youre
likely
to
come
across
but
dont
let
that
stop
you
its
a
complex
easy
to
like
drinkable
beer
served
from
bottle
in
to
a
westbrook
snifter
pretty
proper
poured
a
hazy
golden
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
sour
fruit
salt
citrus
mango
and
lemon
zest
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
lemon
citrus
salt
tropical
fruit
sour
tart
and
citrus
hop
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
an
awesome
brew
alright
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
i
am
typically
brutal
on
most
beers
when
i
review
them
and
am
always
honest
about
how
i
truly
feel
about
them
being
a
huge
fan
of
this
base
beer
and
having
tried
gozu
when
it
was
out
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
most
out
of
the
series
the
citra
hops
added
to
this
one
took
it
to
a
whole
new
level
the
funk
aspect
gets
a
little
lost
in
the
saltiness
going
on
but
im
okay
with
that
this
is
excellently
balanced
which
make
it
rather
easy
to
crush
hoping
this
shows
up
on
a
growler
station
near
me
as
i
need
more
of
this
make
sure
you
do
the
same
tick
they
should
look
to
westbrook
or
rapp
brewing
for
a
better
idea
of
what
a
gose
should
be
this
gose
doesnt
really
make
raul
want
to
gose
for
another
see
what
raul
did
there
but
its
aite
enuff
overall
this
is
pleasant
to
sip
but
not
very
interesting
still
its
a
refreshing
tangy
quaff
that
might
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
those
who
demand
a
vinegar
smell
it
may
be
too
mild
overall
its
my
first
time
trying
this
gose
style
and
its
definitely
something
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
this
has
a
lot
of
the
great
hefeweizen
qualities
but
adds
the
great
sour
notes
o
this
is
a
well
made
gose
and
its
nice
to
see
another
memeber
of
this
rare
beer
style
around
hope
they
bottle
this
one
to
allow
the
number
of
bottled
goses
ive
seen
to
increase
to
two
overall
impression
first
time
enjoying
anything
by
this
brewing
company
and
was
very
pleased
i
hope
california
keeps
continuing
the
trend
of
brewing
sours
would
highly
recommend
this
one
this
is
a
fun
gose
which
would
be
appropriate
to
drink
during
most
days
keep
it
going
noble
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
and
lemonlike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
salty
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
that
makes
this
one
easy
to
drink
opaque
good
laced
white
foam
bright
lemons
some
funk
nice
mellow
malt
fruity
pebble
front
gives
way
to
biting
lemon
and
lil
salt
finish
mouthfeel
light
bodied
high
carbonation
the
high
carbonation
is
another
reminder
of
champagne
and
helps
to
spread
the
orange
and
coriander
around
my
tongue
overall
an
interesting
style
not
the
most
drinkable
but
tasty
o
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
it
is
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
compared
to
other
common
beer
styles
but
is
something
that
probably
isnt
that
appealing
to
the
average
craft
beer
drinker
o
overall
i
like
to
see
a
local
brewery
trying
new
styles
especially
something
like
a
gose
but
this
one
missed
the
mark
the
nose
was
pretty
bad
and
old
smelling
while
the
taste
was
too
salty
too
much
buttered
popcorn
throughout
it
again
cool
to
see
them
do
this
and
ive
enjoyed
every
other
beer
ive
had
from
barrier
so
far
so
i
will
certainly
try
their
new
beers
in
the
future
but
would
avoid
this
one
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
high
white
head
that
fades
quickly
very
little
lacing
it
smells
a
lot
like
weed
with
some
savory
notes
and
also
something
sweet
like
mulberry
the
taste
is
a
little
dominated
by
the
weediness
but
theres
lemon
zest
some
earthiness
a
little
toffee
that
seems
out
of
place
its
viscous
moderately
carbonated
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
prefer
the
leipziger
have
to
review
that
some
time
but
its
far
and
away
better
than
the
bruerys
salt
of
the
earth
not
one
ill
revisit
but
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
o
this
is
just
awful
though
you
might
sprinkle
this
on
some
popcorn
o
this
has
great
drinkability
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
it
is
light
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
for
it
being
so
low
in
alcohol
this
is
my
first
gose
so
i
cant
really
compare
it
to
any
other
beers
of
this
style
but
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
i
would
buy
this
again
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
very
interesting
style
that
i
look
forward
to
finding
again
i
had
my
doubts
about
these
two
guys
breaking
off
attempting
something
like
this
but
it
worked
i
admire
their
restraint
especially
considering
their
background
brewing
at
sixpoint
b
a
rather
okay
gose
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
a
goddamn
abomination
for
what
they
charge
very
good
beer
a
fine
and
complex
interpretation
of
the
style
and
one
that
i
think
is
really
really
good
that
said
its
appalling
that
it
costs
some
25
bucks
a
bottle
there
is
no
validity
to
that
at
all
and
where
i
see
the
need
to
charge
high
prices
for
peach
pit
sours
and
three
year
old
blends
and
all
of
that
this
makes
no
sense
and
its
frustrating
to
me
i
can
go
get
a
case
of
westbrook
cans
for
this
price
and
from
now
on
thats
probably
what
i
will
do
im
not
at
all
disappointed
in
the
beer
im
stoked
on
it
actually
but
i
will
never
buy
it
again
salty
and
tangy
and
with
some
oak
character
to
it
which
i
think
really
does
add
something
to
the
style
i
dont
know
if
its
spent
time
on
oak
or
not
but
there
is
a
woody
element
to
this
the
salt
is
medium
and
the
coriander
isnt
overdone
like
it
so
often
is
the
lactic
acid
is
really
high
but
there
is
a
yeasty
must
too
more
mature
than
others
i
like
it
a
lot
but
it
could
stand
a
little
more
carbonation
and
about
50
off
of
its
price
tag
i
hope
they
arent
trying
to
create
buzz
for
this
beer
and
an
aura
of
elitism
to
this
with
its
price
that
wouldnt
be
cool
but
the
beer
itself
is
very
cool
quite
solid
gose
smooth
citrusy
yet
with
some
vanilla
notes
and
whatnot
serving
type
bottle
o
a
sour
forward
imperial
gose
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
golden
yelloworange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
laces
and
no
sediment
the
beer
settles
quickly
into
a
syrupylooking
undercarbonated
beer
without
head
retention
or
lacing
the
nose
is
funky
upfront
followed
by
some
spice
and
citrus
that
opens
up
into
saline
tomatolike
and
malty
finish
the
taste
presents
salinated
funk
upfront
unsweetened
malt
and
a
bit
of
yeast
fruitiness
in
the
finish
its
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
semisweet
saline
mouthfeel
less
than
expected
carb
a
touch
of
fruit
and
tart
graininess
in
the
finish
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
imperial
gose
that
accents
the
desired
flavors
without
being
overpowering
though
id
prefer
a
lower
abv
onot
as
sour
or
salty
as
some
other
goses
but
the
balance
was
good
very
enjoyable
o
light
crisp
and
tart
nice
spices
quite
tart
compared
to
westbrooks
take
on
the
style
personally
prefer
this
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
finger
thick
head
aroma
is
tart
citrus
with
lemon
peel
and
orange
as
well
as
some
salty
spiciness
normal
body
with
soft
carbonation
flavour
is
sour
with
tart
fruity
lemon
and
lemon
peel
as
well
as
salt
finishes
of
with
a
long
tarty
fruitiness
ending
with
notes
of
sweetly
lemon
drops
ordered
a
glass
at
the
barrel
house
in
portland
after
getting
sweaty
on
my
bike
damn
this
hit
the
spot
this
hazy
yellow
beer
is
sour
but
not
wild
it
has
a
straightforward
almost
clean
tang
the
malts
are
very
mild
under
the
sour
with
a
subtle
bready
wheat
and
toast
character
instead
of
the
banana
and
spice
of
normal
german
wheat
this
is
big
on
the
tangy
grapefruit
and
lemon
zest
sour
o
reminds
me
of
a
very
sour
margarita
lots
of
lemon
lime
and
salt
character
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
i
have
had
very
interesting
beer
and
the
first
of
this
style
for
me
not
something
i
would
get
again
not
at
all
a
session
beer
one
and
done
but
a
nice
summer
drink
that
beats
the
hell
out
of
cider
or
something
worse
a
fantastic
mellow
sour
i
love
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
all
the
time
if
i
could
very
tasty
very
balanced
one
of
those
beers
that
you
stop
and
say
mmm
thats
good
o
very
good
refreshing
diaphonous
grainy
yellow
with
offwhite
fleeting
foam
nose
is
briny
and
sour
with
some
hints
of
grain
salt
pepper
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
sour
for
the
style
lemon
grain
hints
of
triscuits
the
finish
is
a
littles
saliated
and
gives
off
a
green
olive
brine
character
dominated
with
lactic
tart
thin
and
wet
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
i
purchased
a
grenade
of
it
but
i
wouldnt
place
it
too
high
among
goses
refreshing
and
packed
with
flavor
without
overdoing
the
sour
elements
really
nice
an
interesting
beer
the
gose
is
different
to
anything
ive
had
nice
beer
is
light
in
body
and
mildly
salty
the
salt
definitely
takes
a
back
seat
there
the
lactobacillus
character
is
low
and
there
is
a
floral
sense
to
this
beer
that
isnt
unpleasant
i
dont
know
what
i
expected
but
this
beer
let
me
down
o
overall
i
liked
this
gose
i
liked
the
sourness
to
it
especially
in
the
taste
and
just
would
have
liked
a
little
bit
of
a
stronger
nose
would
certainly
try
it
again
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
without
much
retention
and
no
real
lacing
the
nose
carries
a
slight
cider
character
with
a
light
bit
of
malt
the
flavor
is
a
tiny
bit
malty
with
a
very
light
dosing
of
salt
and
a
bit
of
a
redapple
character
mild
cider
light
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
slight
dryness
fairly
good
though
quite
plain
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
and
clear
with
minimal
head
that
rapidly
fades
to
nothing
leaving
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
sour
and
funky
with
notes
of
citrus
the
flavor
is
a
step
up
from
the
aroma
with
more
salt
presence
nice
citrus
flavors
slight
sourness
but
not
puckering
the
body
is
fairly
thin
with
low
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
beer
i
would
have
this
again
this
was
my
first
shot
at
trying
a
gose
and
i
really
liked
it
theres
a
solid
base
of
flavorful
sweetness
and
spice
to
this
but
then
the
tartness
and
crispness
came
in
to
keep
this
not
only
easy
drinking
but
even
a
bit
quenching
on
the
palate
as
well
this
was
unique
but
still
very
accessible
to
me
im
glad
that
i
gave
it
shot
and
id
definitely
be
willing
to
check
out
others
like
it
down
the
line
o
im
not
the
huge
gose
fan
but
this
was
pretty
nice
and
easy
to
drink
d
it
drank
pretty
good
and
was
definitely
glad
to
have
tried
it
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
visually
it
looks
like
a
very
effervescent
brew
but
when
it
hits
the
mouth
it
is
only
lightly
bubbly
in
the
mouth
yet
bubbly
enough
to
keep
it
light
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
and
feel
there
is
seemingly
no
alcohol
impact
in
this
brew
even
for
a
listed
5
abv
i
am
struggling
to
accept
that
it
is
that
this
is
a
very
easily
approachable
brew
and
goes
down
very
smooth
i
have
not
had
many
takes
on
this
style
but
this
one
is
the
best
i
have
had
yet
the
salt
flavoring
is
there
without
an
awkward
feel
left
in
the
mouth
or
being
overdone
give
this
one
a
try
this
beer
is
a
light
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
excellent
light
coriander
with
lactic
tartnes
are
the
most
prominent
notes
the
coriander
character
is
really
fresh
and
vibrant
salt
is
low
thankfullly
the
palate
opebs
crisp
mildly
overcarbonated
maybe
flavors
of
wheat
and
coriander
are
present
this
beer
is
very
lightly
salted
perfectly
so
imo
drying
crisp
clean
and
with
a
lactic
finish
with
lingering
coriander
this
is
excellent
stuff
as
it
warms
up
an
aroma
akin
to
chopped
cilantro
stalks
appears
all
told
an
excellent
gose
probably
the
best
ive
had
an
absolutely
perfect
summer
beer
good
stuff
a
very
enjoyable
summer
beer
matches
well
with
what
ive
come
to
expect
in
a
gose
no
head
dissipation
or
lacing
to
speak
of
clear
orange
amber
body
many
small
bubbles
rising
from
bottom
of
the
glass
pretty
funky
nose
peaches
some
other
stone
fruit
i
couldnt
identify
white
nectarines
and
apples
with
no
noticeable
hop
aroma
big
ass
dose
of
tart
and
sour
funk
in
the
taste
profile
some
grassy
hops
i
do
pick
up
the
salt
but
its
pushed
to
the
back
by
de
funk
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
not
much
effervescence
a
bit
sticky
with
quite
a
dry
finish
a
very
complex
tasting
beer
drinkability
is
quite
high
a
good
refreshing
summer
beer
this
may
be
my
favorite
cascade
gose
so
far
very
tasty
d
refreshing
and
complex
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
that
could
beguile
almost
anyone
while
not
extreme
it
is
unique
enough
that
it
does
not
immediately
lend
itself
to
comparisons
with
other
beers
except
perhaps
to
the
cascade
winter
gose
that
i
got
to
sample
from
a
companions
glass
i
went
to
portland
hoping
to
try
the
gose
at
upright
walked
away
disappointed
that
day
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
one
day
later
with
berliner
weiss
catching
on
to
some
breweries
will
we
see
more
gose
in
the
future
cascades
summer
gose
would
be
a
great
example
to
cast
and
mold
even
if
it
isnt
100
to
leipzig
tradition
d
i
really
havent
had
much
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
dont
know
why
more
brewers
dont
brew
gose
the
body
was
very
good
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
drinkability
was
very
good
ive
had
several
of
these
at
a
local
pub
and
enjoyed
all
of
them
overall
a
very
nice
beer
worth
trying
when
you
see
it
d
i
think
this
is
really
intended
to
be
a
summer
beer
right
now
im
in
the
mood
for
other
things
but
this
is
done
well
enough
that
id
pick
it
up
again
in
the
right
season
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
really
funky
really
good
a
little
to
sour
for
my
liking
but
overall
not
bad
love
this
beer
all
the
goodness
of
their
gose
but
even
better
complete
dryness
overtakes
the
finish
as
the
ale
closes
with
a
snap
elements
of
citrus
peel
soft
perfume
and
sour
white
grapes
give
its
waning
moments
a
convincing
champagne
character
if
not
for
the
linger
of
wheat
that
returns
in
echoes
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
need
more
i
do
think
i
might
like
regular
westbrook
gose
better
though
huge
thanks
to
2000drafts
for
sending
me
a
2nd
box
of
extras
just
insanity
enjoyed
the
other
day
from
a
westbrook
snifter
reviewed
from
notes
pours
a
really
murky
cloudy
orange
yellow
cloudier
than
the
gose
nose
is
sweet
n
sour
and
salty
with
a
bit
of
a
fruity
tartness
that
you
dont
find
in
the
gose
taste
matches
the
nose
a
bit
more
full
than
gose
and
less
saltysour
but
along
the
lines
of
gose
with
a
twist
super
refreshing
and
great
warm
weather
beer
wish
i
could
find
this
locally
overall
i
like
this
better
than
the
standard
gose
even
at
this
age
the
yuzu
fruit
juice
really
adds
a
tropical
like
twist
to
the
original
and
surprisingly
possibly
some
sweetness
highly
crushable
flavorful
and
light
summer
drinker
t
the
initial
taste
is
like
licking
a
lemon
thats
been
dipped
in
salt
cocktail
sauce
light
crackery
malt
citrus
peel
tangerine
and
some
sour
pink
grapefruit
finish
gives
just
a
touch
of
wheat
and
a
lingering
salty
lemon
twang
intensely
sour
and
salty
at
the
same
time
with
a
drying
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
a
lot
more
this
is
an
amazing
beer
o
overall
pretty
awesome
i
love
the
gose
and
the
fruit
addition
adds
a
nice
touch
o
not
as
tart
or
salty
as
their
gose
and
as
stated
above
much
juicier
delicious
beer
but
i
prefer
gose
as
it
is
saltier
and
more
tart
to
me
o
this
is
an
excellent
gose
very
very
tart
but
seems
to
temper
as
it
warms
one
of
my
favorites
ive
ever
had
of
the
style
bravo
a
very
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
higher
abv
beers
that
ive
been
drinking
i
like
it
the
refreshing
citrus
is
nicely
balanced
and
not
too
overbearing
really
bright
lemony
citrus
nose
on
the
beer
that
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
wispy
head
tastes
exactly
like
gose
with
yuzu
juice
very
refreshing
to
have
a
beer
deliver
on
what
you
expect
from
it
the
beer
is
also
refreshing
in
general
its
pretty
tart
from
the
yuzu
juice
but
not
a
sourfunkiness
from
a
wild
ale
overall
westbrook
really
knows
what
theyre
doing
here
this
is
a
delicious
beer
by
any
standard
would
love
to
get
more
i
was
thrilled
to
receive
this
as
an
ip
extra
but
would
happily
have
traded
for
it
overall
pretty
nice
good
tartness
with
interesting
fruity
citrus
and
spices
nice
wheat
pretty
tasty
o
overall
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
yuzu
is
so
well
utilized
here
just
awesome
could
drink
this
all
day
overall
skanky
and
tart
but
deliciously
even
refreshingly
so
can
you
imagine
can
y
well
you
can
probably
imagine
but
yeah
skanky
and
tart
o
a
good
tart
gose
that
isnt
as
salty
as
the
regular
as
the
fruit
tempers
down
the
in
your
face
saltiness
of
gose
but
adds
adds
an
additional
complexity
that
you
dont
get
in
the
original
it
also
softens
the
flavors
in
the
original
which
makes
this
one
more
approachable
overall
just
a
delightful
beer
to
drink
i
love
both
the
gose
and
the
gozu

served
in
a
bottle
inside
some
old
maple
syrup
vessels
that
retain
head
and
keep
aroma
in
this
beer
is
awesome
i
could
sit
at
the
beach
and
consume
it
all
day
front
end
is
salty
and
a
little
coriander
appearence
is
light
with
tons
of
head
clarity
is
perfect
a
basic
gose
taste
leads
into
some
light
sour
notes
and
a
mild
acidic
back
end
nose
is
awesome
gose
with
slight
sour
horse
blacket
notes
could
be
a
little
stronger
but
perfection
is
there
in
subtle
amounts
excellent
lasting
carbonation
throughout
really
cant
say
enough
about
this
a
well
made
gose
with
an
interesting
twist
if
they
put
this
in
6packs
i
would
buy
it
all
the
time
really
nicely
refreshing
every
sip
makes
my
mouth
beg
for
another
one
well
i
thought
id
like
this
beer
more
than
i
did
since
im
a
big
fan
of
gose
as
a
style
and
their
gose
in
particular
i
also
really
like
the
flavor
of
yuzu
and
thought
for
instance
that
it
added
a
nice
twist
to
new
belgiums
version
with
yuzu
of
their
berliner
weiss
here
though
i
dont
think
the
yuzu
adds
anything
and
in
fact
probably
detracts
from
the
base
beers
nice
hit
of
salt
and
subtle
coriander
you
do
get
some
citrus
but
its
not
zingy
in
itself
or
particularly
pronounced
it
just
slightly
mutes
everything
else
i
guess
some
may
like
the
gose
toned
down
a
bit
but
id
prefer
the
base
beer
in
all
its
glory
its
hard
to
say
if
i
prefer
this
over
westbrooks
standard
gose
i
enjoy
gozus
citrus
sweetness
but
miss
goses
saltiness
no
matter
this
is
another
great
brew
from
westbrook
and
well
worth
investigation
pours
a
well
hazed
straw
yellow
hue
glowing
body
with
a
brighter
creamy
white
head
atop
mellow
layer
stays
as
a

gentle

and

tart
citrus
gentle
bread
and
grass
initial
is
firmly
sour
up

lemony
and
yuzu

make
this
a

puckering

shows
lactic

salt
flaked
wheat
and
gentle

cleaner
light

drinkable
sourness
really
quite
nice

is
tart
a

really
that
lactic

citrus

vibe
really
provide
some
synergy
sour

quite
crushable
finish
is
tart
a
bit
slick
and

o
its
like
a
toned

gose
great
still
but
i
prefer

hazy
golden
pour
with
very
little
head
and
lacing
the
nose
is
slightly
sour
citrus
against
a
slight
mineral
background
light
medium
body
low
carbonation
level
but
an
almost
slick
mouthfeel
quite
an
interesting
taste
that
is
a
nice
balance
of
sour
citrus
and
salt
yuzu
juice
yields
a
nice
tartness
that
carries
beyond
the
smooth
finish
another
very
well
crafted
ale
from
westbrook
and
a
new
take
on
an
old
style
best
gose
i
think
ive
ever
had
its
their
standard
gose
if
there
is
such
a
thing
these
days
with
yuzu
juice
added
yuzu
being
an
asian
grapefruit
type
of
citrus
bitter
and
acidic
a
perfect
additive
for
a
beer
like
this
pale
white
wheat
color
to
this
hazy
and
carbonated
like
soda
pop
the
nose
is
soft
wheat
malt
citric
acid
a
hint
of
herbal
roundness
and
a
lemony
funk
from
the
yeast
salt
is
minimal
in
taste
but
gives
it
body
and
a
mineral
flavor
while
the
yuzu
is
profoundly
bitter
and
with
the
coriander
reminds
me
of
fresca
soda
a
very
similar
flavor
profile
minus
the
fake
sugar
of
course
tart
finish
almost
soured
more
so
than
any
other
gose
ive
had
fuller
body
for
its
color
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
flavor
profile
that
is
incredibly
unique
and
lasts
a
long
time
on
my
palate
after
the
swallow
a
genius
beer
in
terms
of
conception
and
execution
something
memorable
here
the
best
incarnation
of
the
style
ive
seen
and
a
beer
i
hope
to
drink
again
highly
recommended
overall
better
and
perhaps
less
challenging
than
their
regular
gose
loads
of
wellcrafted
flavor
in
a
low
abv
brew
overall
this
is
great
not
as
good
as
the
original
but
damn
close
overall
somehow
westbrook
ruined
their
gose
its
not
terrible
but
i
had
high
expectations
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
the
fruit
isnt
overpowering
and
i
think
it
works
well
with
salt
and
sourness
of
the
gose
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
for
enjoying
by
the
water
overall
their
regular
gose
was
my
favorite
until
this
came
along
this
takes
the
regular
gose
to
a
new
level
by
far
my
favorite
westbrook
offering
overall
this
beer
was
amazing
i
need
to
try
more
of
this
style
for
sure
hazy
gold
with
thin
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
funky

pucker
up
saltysour
lemonhead
goodness
lite
with
a
zesty
lemon
tongue
more
please
it
took
me
awhile
to
get
use
to
it
it
tickles
your
palate
with
a
salty
sensation
not
overly
strong
on
the
sour
side
but
its
different
as
it
warms
up
the
natural
sweetness
of
the
beer
starts
to
be
forward
im
glad
i
tried
it
as
for
me
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
grab
it
nasty
taste
why
anyone
would
drink
is
beyond
me
salty
very
tart
hard
to
finish
salt
taste
overwhelming
this
is
my
first
gose
so
im
unsure
how
to
score
it
but
it
is
interesting
as
all
get
out
far
more
than
most
wheat
beers
after
this
i
would
like
to
try
more
pours
an
opaque
straw
which
clears
some
as
the
brew
warms
producing
2
fingers
of
mineral
water
effervescent
somewhat
lasting
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
surface
collar
a
few
motes
strings
of
lacing
aroma
has
a
low
malt
no
hop
profile
offers
little
other
than
brine
tartness
is
if
memory
serves
from
chemistry
classes
long
ago
marked
by
an
acidic
sensation
in
the
nostrils
taste
opens
with
ocean
water
salinity
lactic
acid
sourness
persisting
far
into
the
sip
almost
overpowering
faint
hints
of
wheat
green
apples
lemon
lime
in
a
peppery
clean
crisp
dry
finish
aftertaste
is
a
much
more
potent
salty
lemon
lime
tart
green
apple
version
of
anderson
valleys
the
kimmie
the
yink
the
holy
gose
salty
throughout
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
that
rapidly
dissipates
as
the
brew
warms
puckering
mouthwatering
crisp
prickly
dry
this
style
is
often
brewed
with
coriander
however
i
pick
up
no
coriander
hints
at
all
not
a
fan
of
sours
just
a
bit
too
sour
for
me
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
berliner
weiss
nice
and
tart
and
light
a
little
bitter
salty
really
good
beer
outstanding
as
with
most
gose
not
much
to
look
at
but
interesting
smell
and
outstanding
flavor
perfect
mix
of
salty
and
sour
in
my
opinion
nice
carbonation
and
pop
on
the
tongue
extremely
clean
and
remarkably
refreshing
extremely
enjoyable
beer
hmmm
how
does
one
rate
a
gose
if
they
have
no
basis
for
comparison
well
im
certainly
going
to
try
sours
have
never
been
my
thing
but
ive
heard
so
much
about
this
one
in
particular
that
i
felt
it
would
be
a
crime
not
to
give
it
a
try
with
westbrook
in
my
backyard
and
their
stable
of
stellar
beers
it
had
to
live
up
to
the
hype
right
sort
of
right
from
the
start
the
appearance
is
quite
unappealing
ugly
even
pours
from
the
can
in
to
a
fluted
pilsner
glass
with
a
cloudy
goldenyellow
hue
and
a
little
transparency
zero
head
i
wouldnt
even
know
this
is
carbonated
based
upon
the
appearance
i
hate
to
say
this
but
is
looks
like
concentrated
urine
the
aroma
is
on
par
intense
sour
scents
and
perhaps
a
little
lemon
citrus
are
buried
under
a
dirty
urinal
cake
fragrance
pretty
gross
really
surprisingly
the
taste
completely
transcends
the
other
attributes
fruity
lemonzinging
tartness
clears
a
path
for
a
lingering
grain
flavor
that
imparts
a
little
sweetness
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
a
little
of
smarties
candy
but
with
an
obvious
sour
note
if
youve
ever
enjoyed
sour
patch
kids
this
may
be
your
beer
the
body
is
thin
light
with
a
nice
watery
texture
absolutely
minimal
carbonation
just
enough
to
give
it
a
hint
of
effervescence
surprisingly
quenching
which
invites
the
next
curious
gulp
one
of
the
intriguing
elements
of
this
experience
is
that
the
sourness
washes
away
pretty
quickly
leaving
behind
a
little
residual
saltiness
then
the
salinity
makes
you
feel
compelled
to
take
another
drink
while
this
is
certainly
not
for
everybody
i
have
to
imagine
that
the
target
audience
agrees
that
westbrook
executed
this
one
very
well
if
anything
this
one
got
me
curious
to
see
what
other
gose
offerings
are
like
isnt
that
the
point
of
craft
beer
to
expand
your
horizons
mission
accomplished
westbrook
my
expecpectations
were
somewhat
reserved
since
i
figured
people
in
sc
and
ga
that
are
rating
westbrook
so
well
havent
been
had
much
exposure
to
many
other
goses
out
there
im
wrong
this
is
the
best
gose
ive
ever
had
its
amazing
perfectly
soursalty
and
even
smells
good
every
other
gose
has
smelled
bad
but
ive
overlooked
that
if
you
like
the
gose
style
you
must
try
this
one
4
10
92
a
by
third
sip
it
tastes
like
pure
sea
salt
lost
coriander
flavor
the
can
doesnt
lie
this
is
a
delicious
light
refreshing
beer
definitely
would
make
a
fantastic
summer
quencher
omg
so
happy
about
this
beer
this
beer
tasted
like
a
wet
sock
at
low
tide
i
just
dont
understand
the
hype
what
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you
people
o
i
never
had
anything
like
thi
before
while
i
wouldnt
drink
this
every
day
i
am
thouroughly
enjoying
it
everyone
should
try
this
beer
at
least
once
had
this
at
the
brauhaus
in
philly
great
sour
beer
not
overly
sour
just
a
nice
hint
11715
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
so
much
flavor
o
interesting
brew
lots
of
sour
citrus
backed
by
the
smoothness
of
the
wheat
drinkability
is
fairly
good
though
its
a
little
too
sour
to
be
truly
sessionable
imo
it
is
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
though
one
of
the
best
in
that
regards
very
nice
example
of
the
style
perhaps
the
best
ive
had
not
that
theres
too
many
of
them
out
there
better
get
some
before
it
gose
my
favorite
canned
gose
delicious
and
refreshing
an
everyday
beer
this
is
not
a
good
introduction
to
the
gose
genre
now
is
it
a
good
gose
yes
but
man
is
it
intense
heavily
dosed
with
sea
salt
and
lemon
its
a
fun
beer
for
sure
overall
very
enjoyable
brew
im
fairly
new
to
the
style
but
have
to
go
with
this
as
my
fave
so
it
seems
my
first
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
will
probably
be
my
last
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
new
to
the
style
take
two
sips
one
to
shock
your
pallet
and
the
next
to
decide
if
you
like
it
most
will
either
love
or
hate
this
beer
i
dont
expect
many
people
to
find
it
just
ok
lemony
tasty
salty
thirst
quencher
fun
sour
well
worth
a
try
overall
probably
the
best
gose
i
have
had
i
look
forward
to
drinking
a
lot
more
of
this
style
in
the
new
year
to
come
especially
in
the
warmer
months
wonderful
and
delicious
but
a
tad
too
salty
with
a
nice
bitterness
i
havent
had
many
beers
in
this
style
to
compare
this
one
with
but
if
you
put
this
side
by
side
with
anderson
valleys
the
kimmie
the
yink
the
holy
gose
i
dont
think
i
would
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
made
an
excellent
pairing
with
a
thai
yellow
curry
dish
the
citrus
in
the
beer
really
goes
nicely
with
the
bright
flavors
of
the
curry
and
the
sourness
cuts
right
through
the
spice
one
of
the
better
gose
available
super
flavorful
and
i
didnt
find
it
overly
salty
as
is
a
turnoff
for
me
in
some
goses
great
beer
this
was
the
second
gose
ive
tried
and
arguably
my
favorite
i
loved
the
sour
notes
and
how
clean
and
refreshing
this
beer
was
light
and
crisp
in
nature
if
you
are
a
fan
of
tasty
sours
this
one
will
do
you
right
at
4
abv
you
can
easily
have
a
six
pack
or
two
12oz
can
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
thanks
joe
pours
a
dull
milky
yellow
with
a
sizzling
quarter
inch
bright
white
head
the
immediately
disperses
nose
expresses
citric
acid
a
light
yeasty
quality
and
a
hint
of
brine
taste
follows
nose
pleasantly
tart
citrusy
and
salty
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
lively
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
mild
acidity
that
lightly
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
probably
only
the
third
gose
ive
ever
tried
reminds
me
of
a
salty
belinnerweisse
very
refreshing
id
love
to
have
access
to
this
during
the
warm
weather
cloudy
yellow
tart
and
salty
its
tastes
puts
it
generally
into
the
category
of
the
new
style
tart
saisons
really
well
done
tastes
watery
to
me
gone
too
soon
a
refreshing
and
balanced
gose
that
doesnt
come
off
as
grainy
or
watery
probably
the
best
version
of
this
style
currently
available
in
the
states
low
b
i
am
probably
the
only
person
in
the
beer
nerd
world
who
did
not
love
this
beer
first
off
it
has
no
head
and
looks
cloudy
it
smells
slightly
sour
and
not
in
a
good
way
the
flavor
was
like
sour
green
apples
mashed
into
the
worlds
worst
apple
sauce
i
love
sour
beers
but
i
drain
poured
this
the
perfect
sour
beer
sour
and
salty
there
hasnt
been
a
better
combo
since
nuts
and
gum
in
all
seriousness
i
really
enjoyed
this
sour
o
it
kind
of
sucks
that
my
introduction
to
westbrooks
gose
came
in
the
form
of
its
variants
first
i
had
the
gozu
first
which
was
much
complex
with
the
full
flavor
of
the
yuzu
in
it
then
i
had
the
gose
gone
wild
which
was
brought
by
its
maker
to
a
bottleshare
the
ggw
is
much
more
tart
and
more
akin
to
a
classic
sour
this
is
great
but
really
kind
of
pales
in
comparison
to
its
brethren
i
feel
bad
about
rating
this
so
low
i
have
become
serious
about
the
world
of
craft
beer
for
the
last
34
years
and
am
quite
new
to
rating
beers
on
ba
i
have
been
learning
so
much
about
different
styles
and
was
excited
to
try
my
first
gose
the
saltiness
and
sour
nature
of
this
beer
really
challenges
my
notion
of
what
beer
is
sadly
the
sour
and
salty
feel
was
too
off
putting
for
me
perhaps
this
style
is
simply
not
for
me
or
it
will
become
an
acquired
taste
for
now
i
can
only
say
blech
i
dont
see
myself
even
finishing
this
one
received
via
trade
crisp
sour
and
very
refreshing
the
saltiness
is
not
as
present
as
i
was
fearing
the
light
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
sourtart
nature
keeps
you
from
drinking
too
fast
allowing
the
beer
to
be
savored
one
drink
at
a
time
big
thanks
to
aw
for
sending
me
a
can
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
very
nice
beer
we
have
a
number
of
nw
brewers
out
here
that
make
excellent
gose
style
beers
but
none
of
them
are
quite
like
this
impressive
o
2
25
i
am
pretty
certain
that
the
german
word
for
zima
is
gose
that
is
what
this
reminds
me
of
a
zima
it
is
a
citrus
alcoholic
beverage
i
was
very
excited
to
try
this
when
i
saw
it
at
the
store
i
think
that
this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
feel
bad
i
wanted
to
like
it
more
but
i
dont
only
my
second
ever
gose
so
i
rate
as
a
newbie
better
as
it
warms
up
and
my
palette
gets
used
to
the
tartness
that
is
ever
so
present
not
a
beer
for
me
overall
not
gonna
win
my
heart
from
the
big
stouts
and
barleys
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
aroma
is
lemony
saline
crackery
and
slightly
funky
lemon
dominates
but
theres
some
musty
character
flavor
is
extremely
acidic
citric
and
acetic
acid
are
huge
upfront
though
lactic
surfaces
mid
palate
and
acetic
and
citric
carry
into
the
finish
one
of
the
more
sour
examples
of
the
style
salt
weaves
throughout
but
its
countered
by
lightly
bready
malt
in
the
finish
a
little
too
acetic
wish
lactic
were
less
overwhelmed
overall
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
for
a
long
time
super
tasty
and
levels
of
complexity
that
many
other
gose
do
not
have
i
could
crush
this
all
day
long
golden
straw
color
with
a
stark
white
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
little
to
no
lacing
smell
of
wheat
grain
funk
lemon
lime
and
sea
breeze
flavor
opens
up
with
a
nice
tart
lemon
and
lime
bite
notes
of
grains
from
the
wheat
weave
into
the
mix
finish
brings
a
tart
spicy
and
salty
finish
prickly
mouthfeel
from
the
carbonation
light
body
and
dry
finish
is
nearly
perfect
overall
this
is
just
a
great
beer
thats
refreshing
and
different
canned
916
poured
into
a
snifter
gold
yellow
cloudy
with
one
finger
of
off
yellow
head
good
retention
smells
of
fresh
lemon
and
some
tart
candy
mouth
feel
is
fizzy
and
sharp
but
exactly
what
was
expected
taste
is
salt
sour
lemony
goodness
with
a
great
balance
of
tart
salty
sweet
and
citrus
dry
finish
yum
very
carbonated
and
fizzy
prickles
my
lips
immediately
flavor
is
tart
and
crisp
with
lemon
and
lime
and
a
little
wheat
twang
i
also
get
just
a
bit
of
sweet
fruit
but
that
is
gone
quickly
after
each
sip
finish
is
very
dry
and
leaves
a
lingering
tart
across
my
palate
i
find
this
enjoyable
but
wonder
if
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
on
any
given
day
can
poured
a
light
yellowish
color
gose
with
a
nice
pure
white
foamy
head
aroma
of
tart
notes
with
light
salty
notes
also
discernable
taste
is
a
mxi
between
some
tart
and
sour
notes
with
a
salty
finish
and
limited
coriander
notes
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
i
had
really
high
expectation
considering
all
the
noise
this
one
is
making
but
i
thought
it
was
an
ok
version
of
the
style
at
the
end
of
the
day
cloudy
and
hay
colored
good
fluffy
head
to
begins
thats
gone
quickly
slightly
sour
aroma
light
grain
tart
lime
clean
with
the
wheat
playing
second
fiddle
to
the
other
components
medium
body
and
medium
to
high
carbonation
clean
and
sour
from
start
to
finish
acidic
and
dry
the
wheat
gives
it
some
softness
and
a
dryness
to
keep
it
from
scraping
the
tongue
too
hard
it
does
meet
the
claim
of
being
refreshing
as
the
body
does
lean
light
but
its
got
that
puckering
sourness
to
it
as
well
pours
light
golden
with
a
shortlived
bubbly
white
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
the
nose
is
crisp
spicy
green
apple
lemon
and
a
wisp
of
salt
on
the
palate
tart
lemon
and
mild
salinity
a
touch
grainy
and
a
nice
hint
of
must
in
a
good
way
it
is
light
and
bubbly
and
would
be
the
perfect
summer
patio
beer
fantastic
pours
cloudy
like
juice
lemony
smell
and
a
bit
of
a
tart
and
salty
taste
low
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
unfortunately
not
available
in
my
area
because
i
would
consume
a
case
a
week
o
too
salty
for
my
taste
this
beer
is
more
of
a
novelty
that
should
be
shared
at
tastings
just
to
finish
off
the
can
overall
a
solid
gose
with
lots
of
tart
sour
lemon
and
some
salt
overall
very
nice
crisp
and
pleasant
completely
crushable
thanks
again
tom
o
right
there
with
gose
gone
wild
as
my
favorite
in
the
style
maybe
a
slight
edge
to
ggw
but
still
a
really
impressive
gose
here
a
nice
light
very
sour
beer
o
if
someone
were
to
give
this
to
me
sight
unseen
ida
tagged
it
as
an
american
wild
serving
type
can
t
umami
is
a
good
descriptor
here
sharply
tart
and
salty
upfront
a
touch
of
a
lactic
twang
with
a
backend
of
light
wheat
and
coriander
fades
into
sea
salt
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus
lemon
is
in
there
somewhere
ridiculously
refreshing
and
a
fantastic
take
on
the
style
thanks
chandler
my
issues
with
this
beer
and
it
may
just
be
that
i
dont
overly
care
for
the
style
was
that
although
its
only
4
0abv
it
was
a
sipping
beer
perhaps
due
to
the
saltiness
the
other
problem
was
that
despite
rinsing
thoroughly
with
water
and
wiping
off
my
lips
i
found
it
near
impossible
to
get
rid
of
the
saltiness
rendering
the
next
beer
i
had
slightly
salty
as
well
seems
like
this
is
a
one
and
done
last
beer
of
the
day
for
me
oalthough
this
beer
may
be
too
strong
on
the
salt
to
be
called
authentic
the
salt
certainly
makes
it
tasty
and
thirstquenching
indeed

finally
getting
around
to
enjoying
it
tonight
thanks
rich
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
virtually
nonexistent
head
and
no
lacing
nose
is
sharp
coriander
and
lemony
wheat
with
a
definite
briny
element
with
warmth
a
sorta
yeastydoughy
element
comes
up
and
out
of
the
glass
flavor
is
surprisingly
tart
bright
lemony
lacto
the
sour
notes
blow
out
most
of
the
coriander
except
on
the
finish
when
it
rebounds
with
a
light
saltiness
much
more
sour
than
any
standard
berliner
i
have
had
in
a
while
and
doesnt
have
as
much
saltcoriander
as
the
av
gose
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
punctuated
a
bit
by
the
residual
wheat
malt
drinkability
is
very
high
for
the
one
maybe
a
2nd
can

i
could
use
a
bit
more
of
that
for
balance
and
to
round
out
the
finish
this
can
be
a
polarizing
style
its
certainly
not
for
everyone

o
it
was
ok
probably
the
lower
end
gose
execution
that
i
have
had
but
it
was
pleasant
on
a
july
day
a
decent
saison
from
2nd
shift
but
not
quite
there
with
the
best
the
sour
cherry
notes
tended
to
overwhelm
the
accompanying
flavors
im
forced
to
imagine
someone
at
almanac
genuinely
appreciates
lemon
verbena
the
bit
of
sea
salt
is
perfect
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
good
flavors
and
a
nice
complexity
i
dont
know
how
true
to
style
this
beer
is
but
this
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
obvious
faults
and
it
seems
to
hit
all
the
marks
im
not
super
familliar
with
the
style
but
i
feel
like
all
the
flavors
work
very
harmoniously
effervescence
dances
on
the
tongue
a
very
light
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
lemon
verbena
salt
and
corriander
all
work
very
nicely
together
with
a
very
strong
wheat
finish
this
beer
is
in
your
face
especially
for
being
so
light
in
abv
its
full
of
highs
lows
and
i
dont
knows
but
what
i
do
know
is
its
interesting
enough
that
the
bottle
will
be
gone
quickly
thats
kind
of
what
counts
right
final
score
3
64
drinkability
goes
down
easy
at
5
0abv
its
a
nice
beer
overall
a
decent
gose
and
saltier
than
some
i
have
tasted
i
enjoyed
the
tart
lime
flavor
but
found
the
beer
a
touch
unbalanced
low
b
tart
lemony
nose
with
light
grains
pours
hazy
gold
under
a
big
white
persistent
finely
bubble
foam
collar
this
highly
effervescent
beer
has
a
tart
lemony
salty
refreshing
grainy
palate
it
starts
with
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
but
the
lemony
tartness
soon
rules
there
is
a
faint
bitterness
on
the
finish
in
the
beginning
the
beer
is
like
drinking
a
cloud
but
on
the
finish
a
big
carbonic
burst
triggers
the
pain
receptors
on
your
tongue
and
wipes
the
palate
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
its
not
terrible
not
great
either
pretty
solid
for
a
gose
worth
picking
up
and
trying
if
you
see
it
bomber
poured
into
a
snifter
the
brew
appears
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
cap
that
is
quick
to
fade
the
smell
of
this
is
pretty
much
dominated
by
a
fresh
grainy
scent
not
bad
but
also
kinda
lacking
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
with
a
fresh
grain
aspect
before
getting
lemony
and
slightly
mineralfilled
somewhat
fruity
at
times
as
it
opens
up
this
is
light
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
it
is
easy
drinking
and
fits
the
bill
for
the
style
pours
a
hazy
gloden
yellow
small
head
that
faded
to
nothing
left
no
lacing
smell
is
citrus
wheat
and
a
bit
of
funky
yeasty
aroma
taste
was
quite
tart
with
a
bit
of
bready
wheat
finished
with
a
salty
briny
tone
mouthfeel
was
pretty
light
but
fitting
for
the
beer
pleasing
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
overall
quite
good
a
lot
more
sour
and
tart
than
i
was
expecting
but
i
was
very
happy
with
especially
in
the
taste
the
salt
definitely
comes
through
in
the
taste
too
and
i
like
it
a
lot
a
very
good
gose
id
definitely
buy
again
this
could
use
more
salt
and
less
bitterness
otherwise
not
bad
overall
pretty
good
stuff
this
probably
has
more
german
wheat
beer
character
than
other
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
though
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
get
it
overall
interesting
and
refreshing
overall
the
wheat
is
very
strong
good
but
not
really
what
im
looking
for
in
a
gose
o
a
challenging
gose
serving
type
bottle
overall
pretty
drinkable
but
the
weird
plasticy
thing
in
the
flavor
still
bothers
me
worth
it
if
you
are
interested
in
goses
otherwise
probably
a
skip
old
ba
score
3
80
overall
reasonably
quaffable
and
with
a
subtle
lactic
edge
thats
far
less
aggressive
than
many
of
these
other
goses
that
are
springing
up
across
the
country
still
im
not
sure
why
they
felt
the
need
for
the
verbena
and
would
welcome
its
exclusion
from
future
batches
not
really
my
cup
of
foam
some
intrigue
but
doesnt
taste
nice
enough
to
quaff
down
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
not
the
best
example
for
my
tastes
salty
i
do
like
the
overall
construction
of
the
brew
othis
beer
has
a
few
low
points
that
detract
from
what
is
a
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
the
grainy
aroma
hurts
the
score
but
the
nice
clean
feel
almost
makes
up
for
it
the
salt
level
here
is
moderate
and
the
citrus
flavors
add
some
nice
complexity
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
just
dont
love
it
big
yeast
in
this
sour
tasting
gose
some
lemon
coming
through
slight
spice
as
well
very
bready
without
question
not
a
big
sour
beer
not
very
puckering
but
a
good
overall
sour
beer
it
doesnt
lack
taste
just
not
as
big
as
i
wanted
the
sour
to
be
o
light
and
refreshing
gose
well
with
food
overall
this
is
a
really
cracking
gose
salt
character
is
soft
but
works
really
pleasantly
with
the
tartness
its
a
balance
you
dont
see
in
any
other
style
but
i
think
almanac
has
nailed
the
way
its
meant
to
be

not
much

aroma
was
a
mild
bit

and
then
some
spice
maybe
that
was
the
coriander
flavor
was
not
really
salty
not
very
tart
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
i
have
much
preferred
real
german
made
gose
beers
to
this
it
just
didnt
wow
me
drinkability
very
high
its
almost
a
perfect
summer
quencher
i
wasnt
familiar
at
all
with
this
style
prior
to
tasting
this
one
but
im
going
to
do
my
best
to
remedy
that
problem
as
soon
as
possible
on
tap
at
rock
bottom
in
denver
pours
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
of
barnyard
funk
some
yeast
a
hint
of
salt
tart
lemons
wheat
malts
some
definite
sweetness
here
flavor
follows
the
smell
closely
with
tart
and
sweet
lemons
and
honey
wheat
malts
some
light
saltiness
very
light
and
a
funky
yeasty
finish
the
body
on
this
was
pretty
light
and
refreshing
with
medium
carbonation
this
really
came
off
more
as
a
saison
to
me
but
had
it
side
by
side
with
their
honey
saison
and
this
had
a
slight
salt
tinge
to
it
other
than
that
they
were
very
similar
the
beer
is
a
hazy
sunset
yellowish
orange
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
consisting
of
broken
bubbles
and
noticeable
effervescence
the
aroma
offers
tangerine
assorted
tangy
citrus
wheat
light
sea
salt
a
touch
of
coriander
nice
flavor
very
fruit
forward
zesty
with
a
tart
finish
enjoyable
o
sweet
and
welcoming
a
touch
tart
and
sweeter
but
very
tasty
i
wouldnt
order
it
again
smell
this
pours
a
straw
gold
color
with
cottony
foam
theres
a
light
amount
of
funk
on
the
aroma
with
some
distinct
lemony
notes
like
wet
hay
meets
lemongrass
in
the
best
possible
ways
the
flavor
has
a
crisp
grassy
straw
note
with
an
underlying
funk
to
it
its
approachable
refreshing
delicious
oone
of
the
few
and
better
goses
ive
had
the
salt
worked
well
with
the
tartness
overall
just
a
great
gose
could
just
pound
these
back
all
day
and
night
a
nice
sour
beer
that
has
a
touch
of
funk
crisp
and
refreshing
the
fruit
flavors
are
very
bright
and
only
brought
down
by
the
grains
from
the
malt
not
an
overpowering
sour
this
one
is
great
for
a
hot
summers
day
or
an
average
spring
one
in
socal
pours
a
light
clear
golden
with
almost
no
head
appears
a
bit
like
apple
juice
the
nose
starts
with
dry
wheat
notes
and
plenty
of
coriander
and
lemon
zest
the
coriander
brings
on
some
floral
qualities
mixed
with
citrus
fruit
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
with
the
salt
coming
through
and
cutting
into
the
fruit
and
light
tartness
the
finish
is
heavy
on
lemon
and
almost
drinks
like
a
shandy
this
is
ridiculously
drinkable
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
o
4
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
very
refreshing
while
still
being
interesting
to
drink
i
could
see
this
as
a
great
beer
for
someone
trying
out
sours
for
the
first
time
well
made
beer
here
but
different
from
other
goses
i
have
had
especially
on
the
salt
factor
its
minimal
here
and
still
adds
some
body
but
doesnt
hardly
add
any
dryness
or
minerality
to
the
beer
hazy
blonde
brew
with
a
gorgeous
tall
white
head
foamy
and
thick
it
smells
like
just
a
bit
of
coriander
over
a
wheat
beer
german
wheat
dusty
and
dry
with
that
coriander
seed
perfume
aromatic
the
salt
doesnt
impact
the
flavor
much
here
it
may
be
a
little
under
done
in
that
regard
at
least
compared
to
other
american
made
examples
of
the
style
but
the
beer
is
quite
tasty
despite
that
the
coriander
isnt
as
pungent
as
it
is
in
the
nose
and
the
yeast
does
a
nice
job
drying
this
thing
out
cracker
dry
a
nice
lush
body
gives
a
lot
of
character
to
this
wheat
driven
beer
maybe
a
little
more
simple
than
i
was
expecting
from
almanac
who
always
seems
to
go
crazy
with
odd
yeasts
and
fruits
and
methods
this
one
seems
a
bit
more
basic
to
me
and
even
underwhelms
when
held
up
next
to
other
examples
of
the
gose
style
but
i
like
it
a
lot
find
it
extremely
refreshing
and
would
happily
drink
it
on
the
regular
this
summer
if
it
were
available
here
in
colorado
o
smooth
and
refreshing
not
overly
tart
not
overly
salty
could
be
drier
but
delicious
flavor
overall
im
not
too
familiar
with
goses
but
this
sure
seemed
like
a
friendly
welcome
wagon
into
the
style
nice
and
punchy
without
becoming
too
cloyingly
sour
fair
balance
would
definitely
try
again
and
a
style
ill
try
to
explore
sometime
in
the
future
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
light
tart
effervescent
very
good
on
a
warm
night
pours

murky

with
a
foamy

that

of

floral
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
light
and
refreshing
but
i
think
the
smell
is
slightly
better
on
this
one
if
you
wanted
to
try
a
gose
with
some
userfriendly
drinkability
this
would
be
one
to
try
i
also
liked
the
marionberry
hibiscus
gose
from
widmer
though
i
was
one
of
the
few
apparently
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bine
vine
on
adams
ave
very
nice
gose
from
these
guys
this
was
super
weird
tasted
like
i
was
drinking
a
gose
and
somebody
farted
in
my
mouth
not
fun
o
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
the
combination
of
cilantro
lime
and
roasted
red
pepper
integrate
in
an
interesting
fashion
with
the
slightly
sour
and
salty
gose
seems
more
like
a
combination
of
flavors
found
in
food
than
in
a
beer
but
glad
i
grabbed
this
one
overall
interesting
but
wouldnt
buy
again
the
red
pepper
schtick
is
too
overwhelming
but
again
i
do
find
it
relatively
drinkable
i
like
against
the
grain
in
general
but
this
one
didnt
deliver
as
expected
because
i
was
super
pumped
for
some
serious
cilantro
taste
which
i
didnt
get
i
like
the
ambition
but
i
dont
think
the
roasted
red
peppers
work
at
all
in
this
beer
with
the
lactic
and
citrus
sourness
going
on
the
flavor
of
the
calamansi
is
very
nice
and
would
actually
make
a
killer
gose
on
its
own
o
ill
dock
it
points
for
the
pepper
being
the
only
of
the
many
ingredients
that
i
can
actually
taste
but
give
it
some
credit
for
the
red
pepper
flavor
actually
working
with
the
acidity
great
summertime
session
beer
against
the
grain
brewery
there
gose
the
neighborhood

overall
a
very
unique
and
salty
gose
would
be
perfect
for
a
michelada
or
a
bloody
for
fans
of
shorts
bloody
beer
etc
overall
sadly
i
did
not
like
this
beer
at
all
it
smells
of
vomit
and
with
a
huge
aftertaste
of
pizza
would
not
drink
again
under
any
circumstance
its
obvious
that
the
gose
style
wants
to
die
but
its
guys
and
gals
like
these
that
are
dragging
the
style
into
the
twentysecond
century
kicking
and
screamin
an
average
gose
at
best
o
approachable
for
the
style
light
and
not
overpowering
pours
hazy
and
light
looks
like
grapefruit
juice
the
nose
reveals
some
bread
and
light
funk
the
taste
is
similar
lightly
bready
little
citrus
sticky
white
lacing
throughout
consumption
very
drinkable
brew
but
lacking
bit
funkier
and
more
salty
and
id
be
telling
a
different
tale
all
in
all
a
nice
entry
level
gose
wow
this
beer
should
get
more
attention
best
beer
so
far
in
fl
just
an
excellent
combination
of
flavors
and
a
very
nicely
done
gose
on
par
with
westbrook
for
sure
near
perfect
gose
or
at
least
a
near
perfect
american
representation
the
tight
malt
drinkability
of
this
beer
and
interesting
fruitymelony
aroma
and
flavors
make
this
gose
stand
out
its
hard
to
judge
carbonation
but
it
could
also
stand
with
a
bit
more
sour
really
well
done
i
hope
this
style
takes
off
the
craft
world
could
do
with
a
few
more
like
this
one
overall
elegant
and
sophistocated
gose
its
easily
the
best
gose
that
i
have
ever
had
it
is
effortlessly
better
that
westbrook
gose
i
have
honestly
never
heard
of
rapp
brewery
before
but
i
will
be
keeping
an
eye
out
for
them
now
this
beer
has
absolutely
no
flaws
overall
this
brewery
has
built
a
reputation
on
its
gose
and
it
is
welldeserved
nye
growler

of
stevencon
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
thin
white
head
and
same
collar
aroma
is
lemony
and
very
light
dry
barnlike
funk
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
a
slight
brineyness
to
it
nice
light
body
and
mediumly
carbonated
d
first
gose
for
me
and
this
one
is
not
bad
at
all
without
any
comparison
this
seems
to
be
pretty
well
done
to
style
would
make
for
a
great
beach
beer
glad
to
have
tried
i
dont
think
gose
will
be
a
fav
of
mine
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
o
overall
i
liked
this
gose
a
lot
id
put
it
slight
after
the
westbrook
and
cascade
goses
ive
had
as
one
of
the
best
light
and
crisp
with
some
nice
lemon
tartness
like
a
berliner
but
the
salt
comes
through
in
the
taste
for
sure
worth
seeking
out
and
would
like
to
have
it
again
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
fruity
pebbles
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
fruity
and
salty
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
refreshing
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
this
might
be
the
only
first
example
of
the
style
ive
had
but
i
find
it
quite
enjoyable
nothing
id
always
have
in
the
fridge
but
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
definitely
an
interesting
style
o
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
gose
with
which
to
compare
it
but
i
really
like
this
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
tasty
plus
the
4
abv
means
i
can
finish
the
growler
without
hurting
myself
verdict
a
very
nice
take
on
the
gose
from
sante
adairius
simple
and
balanced
refreshing
with
pleasant
bright
qualities
i
would
love
to
enjoy
this
in
quantity
during
the
summer
months
a
hazy
light
straw
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
this
looks
good
the
nose
is
brilliant
bright
sour
focused
with
a
blend
of
funk
earth
mushrooms
a
touch
of
sulfur
salt
and
coriander
all
on
a
wheaty
bready
base
this
smells
excellent
the
palate
mirrors
these
flavor
notes
with
the
robust
wheat
base
dextrinous
and
lending
a
backbone
for
the
lactic
and
bretty
flavors
refreshing
very
nice
overall
had
this
at
the
end
of
the
night
which
was
probably
foolish
nice
beer
but
perhaps
i
missed
some
of
its
nuances
one
of
the
best
takes
on
a
gose
i
have
encountered
neon
yelloworange
with
floral
and
citrus
right
away
ever
so
slightly
funky
not
as
salty
as
some
other
contenders
but
the
sea
salt
is
there
all
around
solid
salty
poo
better
after
10
minutes
in
the
glass
to
air
out
but
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
on
tap
at
the
brewery
pours
a
dark
pumpkin
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
stone
fruits
and
mild
saltiness
funk
and
banana
flavor
is
vivid
dried
apricots
with
mild
coriander
and
brine
really
fruity
brett
c
high
carbonation
dry
finish
really
came
together
well
blahh
it
wasnt
anything
special
as
soon
as
the
bottle
opened
you
could
smell
a
harsh
acidity
and
tartness
the
beer
followed
that
to
a
tee
there
was
a
nice
brininess
to
the
body
of
the
beer
and
it
was
carbed
well
it
was
just
above
and
beyond
the
level
of
sour
that
i
expect
from
a
gose
the
sour
level
was
challenging
rather
than
quenching
the
incredible
lacto
tartness
and
builds
up
of
vinegar
flavor
is
a
negative
any
real
oyster
flavors
or
aromas
are
overwhelmed
subtlety
is
not
in
night
shifts
repertoire
its
a
gose
but
not
tons
of
lemon
and
a
healthy
dose
of
salt
unique
and
well
played
decent
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
tart
seems
like
night
shift
has
their
lacto
chops
down
but
lacks
in
the
quality
controlconsistency
department
of
some
of
their
other
brews
berliners
and
now
gose
from
night
shift
have
all
been
good
so
far
lactic
excellence
only
thing
that
turns
me
off
is
the
build
up
of
that
vinegar
feel
towards
the
end
of
my
glass
ogoses
are
wonderful
that
is
all
you
need
to
know
this
is
another
yummy
one
according
to
my
notes
this
beer
is
tasty
give
it
a
good
score
this
really
is
one
of
it
not
the
best
examples
of
a
gose
i
have
ever
had
its
nicely
sour
and
tart
and
its
not
so
salty
that
i
felt
sick
afterward
thanks
stomach
this
is
worth
seeking
out

what
a
complex
brew
i
havent
written
a
review
in
a
while
i
decided
i
rather
had
then
stare
at
my
phone
while
with
friends
trying
beers
felt
compelled
to
write
something
to
recall
this
one
later
aroma
is
very
sweet
but
not
overly
so
with
notes
of
pineapple
orange
salt
wet
towels
and
flavor
following
with
salt
more
wet
towel
perfectly
tart
citrus
lemon

and

color
somewhere
between
straw
and
golden
pours
cloudy
and
opaque
filmy
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
muted
with
sour
fruit
and
seaside
tones
slightly
tart
twang
the
saltiness
is
barely
perceptible
finishes
with
a
bit
of
funk
light
body
and
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
very
well
done
gose
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
clear
yellow
color
with
a
nice
big
white
head
that
fell
into
a
nice
thin
cap
that
lasted
throughout
the
beer
the
beer
gave
off
a
light
sourish
aroma
the
taste
was
very
good
and
not
overly
sour
but
enough
to
be
very
solid
the
beer
had
a
lighter
feel
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
had
good
carbonation
given
the
abv
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
long
and
would
if
were
on
tap
near
where
i
live
taste
is
incredible
yes
its
a
salt
beer
the
salt
actually
evens
out
the
lactic
acid
pretty
well
and
while
still
getting
a
sour
taste
it
isnt
the
palate
ruiner
some
sours
can
be
i
could
drink
pint
after
pint
of
this
particularly
at
the
low
abv
overall
a
good
session
beer
something
that
could
be
sipped
after
work
outside
or
while
sitting
outside
during
a
warm
late
summer
or
early
fall
afternoon
i
would
have
it
again
particularly
on
a
warm
afternoon
o
a
delightful
gose
could
be
more
complex
but
its
flavorful
and
refreshing
the
beer
looks
gorgeous
light
yellow
dense
white
head
excellent
lacing
all
hallmarks
of
a
good
beer
the
nose
otoh
is
awful
it
smells
like
the
material
used
in
diapers
to
soak
up
pee
and
slightly
used
to
boot
i
get
no
salt
no
coriander
no
funk
the
palate
is
also
just
way
way
off
downright
terrible
this
also
does
taste
like
a
peedin
diaper
light
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
i
guess
the
feel
is
decent
for
the
style
but
boy
is
this
gross
four
of
us
couldnt
finish
a
4oz
pour
tried
side
by
side
with
the
new
gose
from
flying
dog
and
well
this
beer
didnt
fare
well
by
comparison
little
bit
of
funk
up
front
tart
and
fresh
with
the
saltiness
kicking
in
subtlety
at
the
backend
decent
ive
had
all
3
batches
of
this
beer
it
has
evolved
so
much
it
has
that
traditional
funky
smell
salty
sourness
and
that
beautiful
hazy
color
very
average
for
a
gose
probably
the
worst
smelling
beer
i
have
ever
had
straight
up
full
baby
diaper
i
had
to
struggle
through
the
smell
to
drink
the
rest
of
this
one
if
you
pinch
your
nose
it
tastes
pretty
good
pour
at
a
bottle
share
sour
bready
aroma
very
light
golden

slight

taste
pretty
good
its
wonderful
overall
i
do
not
think
it
is
quite
on
par
with
westbrook
but
i
would
certainly
buy
this
if
they
canned
it
super
solid
gose
great
earthy
and
salt
notes
needs
a
bit
more
souring
and
coriander
im
rating
this
on
the
pure
experience
and
not
necessarily
how
it
adheres
to
the
style
definition
as
for
the
experience
its
wonderful
pour
is
slightly
hazed
pale
golden
amber
with
a
tight
white
head
nose
is
pungent
grapefruit
and
citrus
faint
salt
and
a
touch
of
mineral
brett
and
lemon
taste
has
a
faint
touch
of
grain
a
bit
sweet
grapefruit
and
citrus
moderate
acidity
very
little
salt
lacks
balance
of
a
good
gose
gets
a
bit
sweet
but
still
very
bright
downright
delicious
such
an
interesting
brew
seemed
like
it
needed
a
review
appearance
like
a
mango
puree
golden
apricot
colored
very
opaque
nose
is
barnyard
funk
horse
blanket
lemon
piney
hops
taste
is
very
tart
almost
sour
lots
of
lemony
citrus
with
lots
of
funk
dont
know
if
there
is
brett
but
a
clear
earthiness
is
present
the
salt
really
comes
through
as
does
the
really
citrusy
hop
flavor
a
hint
of
coriander
comes
through
but
not
as
much
as
expected
not
much
carb
almost
a
smooth
buttery
texture
that
is
slightly
offputting
overall
this
is
more
of
a
dry
hopped
bretty
sour
brewed
in
a
barn
with
some
gose
ingredients
than
a
true
gose
for
me
there
are
gueuzelike
flavors
mixing
with
a
sharp
cheese
funkyness
salt
and
hop
citrus
not
what
i
expected
slightly
off
putting
not
really
a
gose
but
surprisingly
good
verdict
a
delicious
gose
from
de
garde
really
puckery
and
tart
but
with
nice
complexity
for
a
simple
and
refreshing
style
this
beer
looks
like
hell
but
really
hits
the
spot
salty
floral
tart
and
super
drinkable
id
love
to
knock
this
beer
back
all
day
in
the
summer
months
bottle
poured
into
a
prairie
2nd
anniversary
stem
glass
while
im
waiting
for
my
dg
stem
glass
to
arrive
complete
silence
on
opening
the
cap
indicating
low
or
no
carbonation
an
aggressive
pour
yielded
a
completely
lifeless
liquid
no
carbonation
whatsoever
no
head
murky
orangeyellow
color
in
the
aroma
lots
of
raw
citrus

and
not
much

in
the
taste
loads
of
citrus
zest
and
oil
mostly
grapefruit
with
strong
additions
of
orange
and
lemon
light
coriander
spice
and
an
unmistakable
salty
finish
the
mouthfeel
really
suffered
by
the
complete
lack
of
carbonation
turning
what
would
have
probably
been
a
very
good
gose
into
a
glass
of
citrus
juice
even
a
slight
bubbly
tingle
would
have
been
a
major
improvement
but
it
just
wasnt
here
overall
tasty
but
kind
of
hard
to
drinkdue
solely
to
the
carbonation
lack
thereof
bottle
from
sam
by
way
of
brian
thanks
pouring
a
mostly
clear
light
orange
yellow
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
that
falls
off
to
a
ring
leaving
little
lacing
this
looks
solid
the
nose
is
just
incredible
bright
juicy
fruity
hops
with
a
moderate
amount
of
coriander
beautifully
paired
to
amplify
each
others
strengths
along
with
a
little
bit
of
citron
and
lemon
this
just
smells
incredible
in
some
ways
this
is
not
unlike
jaljeera
coriander
character
is
bright
and
fresh
lightly
toasted
salt
is
minimal
some
mild
ginlike
aromatics
are
also
present
the
palate
opens
quite
sour
with
a
big
citrusy
sourness
lemony
and
moderately
potent
along
with
a
mild
coriander
note
the
citrus
sourness
pairs
beautifully
with
the
hops
juicy
and
fruity
with
a
blend
of
citrus
tropical
fruit
pineapple
mango
guava
mildly
briny
on
the
finish
along
with
some
citrus
sourness
this
is
incredible
stuff
highly
recommended
wow
wonderful
light
tartness
and
full
of
bright
citrus
hop
flavor
the
amarillo
and
citra
make
this
beer
it
is
great
and
refreshing
everything
i
could
have
asked
for
in
this
serving
type
bottle
overall
quite
enjoyable
great
components
but
some
parts
need
improvement

acidic
excellent
one
of
the
best
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
wow
verdict
a
lovely
gose
from
de
garde
bright
delicate
refreshing
and
super
crushable
the
fruit
flavor
is
fresh
and
juicy
plenty
sour
without
being
crippling
and
the
coriander
and
sea
salt
flavors
add
a
nice
counterweight
stunning
for
the
style
more
lemon
and
sour
than
normal
hose
otherwise
about
the
same
both
world
class
beers
pour
is
pale
yellow
hazed
puffy
white
head
nose
is
very
dusty
brett
a
hint
of
sea
salt
and
mineral
orange
peel
not
really
citrusy
but
husky
peel
light
hoppy
pineapple
behind
taste
has
a
touch
less
going
on
a
little
bit
of
grain
comes
in
up
front
still
a
light
touch
of
dusty
brett
nicely
hoppy
citrus
and
pineapple
with
a
gentle
bitterness
light
body
well
carbonated
semi
dry
finish
not
unlike
the
regular
hose
this
is
a
mostly
clear
light
yellow
orange
with
a
dense
off
white
head
that
falls
off
to
a
ring
plenty
juicy
and
fruity
this
has
a
more
white
wine
and
mineral
character
than
hose
great
blend
of
coriander
and
lemon
as
well
the
palate
opens
sour
though
seemingly
more
as
sour
as
hose
lemony
citrusy
mildly
earthy
moderately
mineraly
white
wine
grapes
and
a
touch
of
salt
are
all
present
decidedly
unorthodox
this
is
extremely
delicious
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
light
and
airy
on
the
palate
the
sourness
lightens
it
as
well
excellent
similar
to
the
citraamarillo
hose
but
less
of
the
great
citrus
flavor
light
in
body
with
nice
carbonation
citrus
rind
lemon
and
salt
really
nice
balance
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
the
musty
lemonade
that
sometimes
accompanies
the
style
delious
beer
bottle
solid
beer
but
compared
to
others
of
same
style
it
falls
a
little
short
doesnt
have
the
tartness
or
depth
of
flavor
no
where
near
as
salty
as
some
gose
also
not
as
sour
but
it
has
a
delicious
sea
salt
after
taste
a
good
beginner
gose
its
very
palatable
im
trying
to
figure
out
what
yeast
strain
this
is
anyone
have
any
idea
the
bottle
was
over
carbonated
but
it
was
good
after
i
let
it
sit
in
the
glass
for
20
minutes
there
may
have
been
a
bottlecorking
issue
the
bottles
ive
had
were
a
little
off
ontap
remains
amazing
great
little
beer
different
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
terrific
gose
compares
favorably
to
most
anderson
valley
blood
orange
is
superior
but
as
for
east
coast
offerings
this
one
tops
the
list
excellent
beer
cant
wait
to
try
more
from
them
first
gose
i
have
ever
had
750ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
served
in
a
stange
90
of
the
cylinder
was
comprised
of
dense
bright
white
foam
off
the
initial
pour
copious
tiny
bubbles
are
present
effervescing
insolution
and
adhering
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
clarity
is
translucent
nose
expresses
clean
bready
yeast
aromas
a
kiss
of
lemon
and
a
hint

consistent
with

light
acidity
pleasant
lemony
quality
salt
is
barely
detectable
clean
yeast
and
light
biscuity

are
also

mouthfeel
is
light
in

with
a
refreshing
carbonation
and
an
easy
acidity
all
and
all
very
pleasant
and
easydrinking
if
it
wasnt
labelled
as
a
gose
id
just
have
assumed
it
was
a
berlinner
weisse
the
least
salty
of
any
goses
ive
tried
id
love
to
see
this
beer
in
tallboy
cans
on
tap
at
the
el
gato
cantina
in
burlington
goes
great
with
mexican
food
my
desert
island
beer
love
this
stuff
the
bottles
are
amazing
its
always
beautiful
on
draft
or
from
a
growler
i
just
cant
get
enough
overall
interesting
very
berliner
weiss
like
tart
sour
lemony
flavours
with
grainy
doughy
yeasty
dry
finish
nice
coriander
touch
of
salt
and
general
gose
characters
too
but
quite
tart
definitely
light
refreshing
summer
drink
the
hype
for
this
one
is
deserved
just
really
tasty
salty
and
sour
actually
does
work
well
a
restrained
gose
medium
lemon
tart
qualities
in
the
front
not
much
saltiness
in
the
back
with
a
good
wheat
backbone
more
full
flavored
than
the
anderson
valley
version
but
less
tart
and
flavorful
than
westbrooks
cheers
all
overall
just
a
solid
gose
very
nice
overall
a
phenominal
summer
brew
i
hope
they
bottle
the
gose
with
currents
at
some
point
overall
a
nice
and
peachy
example
of
the
style
never
had
a
gose
like
this
tastes
like
a
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
with
a
goses
saltiness
would
definitely
get
this
again
gose
seems
like
one
of
the
best
hot
day
beers
along
with
berliners
and
ipas
for
me
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
it
is
good
to
see
it
being
made
in
new
england
a
style
that
deserves
more
exposure
overall
this
is
a
tasty
refreshing
easy
drinker
im
drinking
it
outside
on
a
nice
day
and
its
just
great
for
that
well
done
brew
overall
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
beer
its
well
crafted
subtle
and
refreshing
oi
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
salt
is
perfectly
integrated
and
its
a
solid
beer
through
and
through
on
the
whole
an
exceptionally
wellcrafted
gose
refreshing
and
smooth
incredibly
easydrinking
would
pair
amazingly
with
seafood
wish
this
was
bottled
in
ma
so
i
could
take
some
down
to
the
cape
for
the
summer
im
having
this
after
a
malty
amber
and
this
is
lip
puckeringly
sour
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
spritz
it
becomes
smoother
as
i
drink
it
in
fact
the
subtleties
come
through
toward
the
end
of
the
glasstheres
a
creaminess
that
really
adds
to
the
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
surprisingly
short
updated
from
a
4
had
rating
would
still
be
a
straight
4
for
me
if
not
for
a
slightly
lackluster
appearance
ive
had
this
a
number
of
times
ontap
and
from
the
bottle
and
consider
it
a
great
u
s
example
of
the
gose
its
on
the
funkier
side
of
things
of
the
style
reminds
me
of
a
berliner
weisse
in
some
ways
tart
lemony

good
light
feel
with

right
now

very
good
example

lemongrass
crackery

and

unlike
some
goses
where
the
salt
component
is
more
implied
than
anything
it
was
very
prominent
in
this
beer
the
beer
had
a
very
distinct
threepart
effect
on
my
palate
up
front
it
started
off
like
an
earthy
berliner
weisse
funky
crackery
with
a
good
dose
of
coriander
midpalate
tart
and
fruity
notes
of
lemon
and

markedly
briny
confusing
the
salivary

very
nice
lightmedium

complex
and
drinkable
even
if
its
not
something
id
want
to
stick
with
all
night
long
but
definite
points
for
complexity
overall
a
good
interpretation
of
this
relatively
newlyresurrected
style
ive
had
lost
nations
gose
on
23
occasions
now
from
growlers
that
have
been
brought
back
to
md
from
vermont
ive
tried
34
goses
now
and
lost
nations
is
probably
the
best
or
one
of
the
best
out
there
it
is
the
perfect
balance
of
saltiness
and
tart
a
few
other
goses
ive
sampled
were
more
sourtart
than
the
lost
nation
one
however
the
overall
flavor
profile
of
lost
nations
was
better
extremely
sessionable
and
thirst
quenching
one
of
the
most
delightful
summer
beers
session
beers
one
could
ask
for
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
nonic
the
beer
is
a
bright
light
goldenyellow
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
bright
white
head
nose
of
tart
and
floral
with
a
grainy
backbone
subtle
sour
notes
flavors
are
smooth
fruit
sweetness
initially
with
apple
and
pear
tart
and
sweet
afterwards
smooth
and
crisp
in
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
tart
fruit
and
sweet
with
a
dry
lingering
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
this
was
my
first
lost
nation
beer
and
i
was
definitely
impressed
im
excited
to
see
more
breweries
producing
this
style
which
is
particularly
refreshing
on
a
warm
breezy
summer
evening
oenjoyed
this
beer
only
one
i
have
had
of
the
style
but
look
forward
to
trying
more
to
get
a
better
sense
of
which
ones
are
the
best
examples
of
the
style
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
every
time
i
have
a
gose
i
wonder
why
someone
thought
salt
in
beer
was
a
good
idea
i
expect
great
things
enjoyed
ontap
at
the
mule
bar
winooski
the
beer
has
a
cloudy
pale
straw
appearance
with
a
head
forming
at
the
sides
nose
is
briny
and
lemony
smells
like
something
to
chase
down
oysters
which
the
bar
serves
very
pleasant
tastethe
salt
presence
is
in
balance
with
lemon
citrus
peel
and
spice
coriander
a
nice
sipper
on
a
summer
afternoon
plus
of
the
few
goses
ive
had
this
one
is
enjoyable
and
not
just
a
novelty
salt
beer
very
clean
finish
and
lively
mouthfeel
to
coat
the
tastebuds
poured
into
a
hefeweizen
glass
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
golden
amber
with
a
very
thin
bright
white
head
head
didnt
last
long
but
had
nice
cling
with
numerous
streams
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
not
really
cloudy
at
all
aroma
had
a
small
hit
of
bitter
but
a
nice
malty
smell
with
some
citrus
that
had
a
bit
of
kick
to
it
from
a
tad
of
spice
flavor
was
a
tart
lemony
with
a
strong
salty
note
not
overpoweringly
so
but
enough
to
stand
out
dry
in
the
mouth
but
yet
had
a
bit
of
stickiness
at
the
same
time
that
was
odd
overall
a
nice
change
from
the
norm
flavor
was
bit
unusual
to
be
sessionable
but
was
nicely
drinkable
with
no
real
downsides
some
random
strangers
suggested
to
try
this
new
brewery
and
i
was
passing
by
and
did
what
a
great
suggestion
i
had
a
pint
of
fose
with
my
philly
sandwich
the
sandwich
was
great
and
the
salt
tinged
gose
complimented
it
nicely
great
golden
color
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
bready
nose
but
the
flavor
had
all
the
tartsalt
goodness
one
expects
from
this
style
very
forward
and
not
watered
down
at
all
an
beautiful
smear
beer
wishing
i
lived
closer
this
place
has
a
good
future
an
outstanding
gose
one
of
the
more
intense
ones
ive
had
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
without
a
lot
of
head
unassuming
to
say
the
least
the
nose
is
light
on
the
coriander
not
as
herbal
heavy
as
some
of
them
the
flavor
is
super
bold
not
understated
at
all
bright
and
snappy
salty
malty
goodness
where
the
herbal
element
highlights
the
main
ingredients
not
takes
over
there
is
come
citrus
here
and
some
light
wheat
malt
but
the
mouthfeel
is
what
makes
this
beer
so
unique
to
me
its
not
quite
salty
but
its
not
held
back
at
all
and
its
got
this
gnarly
power
of
sucking
all
the
moisture
out
of
my
mouth
almost
instantly
almost
pucker
in
that
way
but
it
makes
me
want
to
drink
another
sip
time
and
time
again
its
just
lovely
so
much
character
for
such
a
light
beer
i
wish
there
were
more
of
these
gose
styles
around
but
as
it
stands
this
one
is
near
the
head
of
its
class
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
night
now
that
its
after
midnight
i
guess
i
did
all
i
got
was
a
weakly
flavored
average
wheat
beer
overall
this
is
a
tasty
gose
would
repeat
didnt
care
for
the
wheat
sour
combo
o
so
close
to
corona
yet
so
far
away
super
light
and
drinkable
but
has
that
little
edge
of
real
flavor
and
crispness
over
the
aforementioned
macro
and
others
like
it
gose
will
probably
never
be
a
favorite
style
of
mine
but
this
sample
has
all
the
characteristics
to
make
me
respect
and
appreciate
the
category
great
with
mac
n
cheese
very
good
beer
appearance
is
traditional
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
that
soon
settles
and
a
hazy
yellow
color
aroma
is
grain
and
yeast
on
my
first
sip
i
got
wheat
grain
a
little
tart
coriander
but
no
salt
second
sip
got
all
of
that
but
then
got
a
little
salt
too
body
is
just
right
very
nice
drinking
beer
wouldnt
mind
another
sought
for
so
long
and
then
its
ok
i
get
those
salty
coriander
flavors
andbut
reads
like
a
wheat
beer
so
theres
that
drives
it
home
i
dont
much
like
wheat
beers
sparkles
on
the
tongue
though
and
goes
pretty
well
with
a
beet
sandwich
onot
sour
lacking
in
salt
not
sure
how
this
gets
classified
as
a
gose
tasted
like
hot
dog
water
but
in
a
good
way
not
overly
salty
and
the
coriander
was
allowed
a
little
breathing
room
not
bad
at
all
pours
a
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
a
solid
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
smells
like
an
infected
hefeweizen
although
not
necessarily
in
a
bad
way
grassy
funky
wheat
corriander
tart
lemon
zest
and
yogurt
a
light
saltiness
as
well
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
well
a
funky
spiced
wit
that
got
the
lacto
treatment
i
wish
there
was
slightly
more
tart
and
slightly
less
corriander
though
mouthfeel
is
crisp
appropriate
for
the
style
i
wish
it
was
slightly
more
tart
and
funky
though
i
do
still
really
enjoy
this
beer
im
not
a
big
wheat
beer
drinker
but
this
is
a
go
to
summertime
brew
anytime
its
around
nice
lemon
tartness
great
body
and
finishes
clean
overall
this
is
an
entry
level
sour
which
might
make
a
decent
session
beer
stronger
sour
presence
is
called
for
decent
for
what
it
is
intending
to
be
outlier
detected
justify

with

its

i
had
a

slight

overall
a
fairly

bottle
or
something
but
this
was
terrible
perhaps
ill
give
it
another
shot
some
other
time
taste
is
orange
coriander
and
lemon
i
do
not
get
the
saltiness
that
i
typically
associate
with
the
style
despite
a
bit
of
mineral
taste
worth
a
try
but
there
are
others
that
i
prefer
in
the
style
not
sure
just
how
to
rate
this
as
i
am
completely
new
to
this
style
and
cannot
seem
to
find
the
style
guidelines
for
gose
anywhere
on
the
internet
hey
bjcp
dont
you
think
its
time
you
updated
the
style
guidelines
on
your
website
it
aint
2008
anymore
from
what
i
gathered
i
feel
like
there
should
be
more
of
a
salty
salinelike
character
to
this
beer
that
im
not
getting
other
than
that
i
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
im
still
relatively
new
to
enjoying
gose
style
beers
but
i
feel
this
is
a
solid
representation
of
this
most
interesting
brew
there
is
a
sourness
and
funkiness
at
play
here
with
a
citric
and
salty
feel
enjoyable
and
thought
provoking
its
really
smooth
but
sometimes
the
sour
can
be
overpowering
dont
drink
this
with
spicy
food
sweet
and
sour
all
the
way
the
taste
has
mild
malt
with
wheat
character
and
light
grain
toastiness
and
slight
mineral
aspect
but
not
excessively
salty
tasting
with
mild
tropical
fruit
in
the
background
overal
i
liked
this
very
good
traditional
and
drinkable
gose
more
traditional
than
some
which
is
unexpected
considering
the
brewer
but
pleasant
and
quaffable
coming
off
westbrooks
salt
laden
mouth
popper
this
just
feels
lackluster
this
is
enjoyable
to
drink
sweet
witbier
with
a
touch
of
salt
and
tartness
if
you
like
your
gose
closer
to
a
sour
this
may
not
do
it
for
you
but
its
a
good
brew
im
new
to
the
style
not
sure
if
i
like
it
if
u
like
refreshing
beers
give
this
one
a
shot
o
like
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
not
being
a
salt
person
its
extremely
tasty
and
super
refreshing
but
doesnt
have
any
overpowering
flavors
nicely
harmonized
the
palate
opens
tart
refreshing
and
with
a
blend
of
buttermilk
yogurt
wheat
bread
and
some
grist
the
mid
palate
has
a
mild
coriander
flavor
but
the
lack
of
salt
makes
this
pretty
interesting
by
taking
away
that
downright
quenching
character
this
really
veers
off
into
berlinerweiss
waters
very
light
in
body
with
a
mild
watery
moutfeel
disappointingly
so
this
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
and
feels
ok
on
the
palate
decent
stuff

less

more

mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
falling
just
shy
of
bright
this
is
probably
my
only
second
experience
with
the
style
so
i
dont
have
too
many
frames
of
reference
to
compare
this
to
that
said
this
would
make
a
great
summer
offering
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
berlinner
weissewitbier
hybrid
nice
easy
drinking
not
over
done
with
coriander
and
thats
a
good
thing
good
buy
light
refreshing
yet
tasty
clean
and
refreshing
highly
quaffable
however
the
lacto
plays
a
minuscule
role
in
this
gose
unfortunately
prost
not
sure
where
im
coming
out
on
this
beer
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
gose
and
ive
been
excited
to
try
one
its
a
delicate
light
bodied
beer
nice
dark
yellow
color
with
medium
haze
and
little
to
no
head
the
taste
as
first
seemed
complex
with
a
slight
bit
of
belgian
slight
lacto
acid
but
not
at
all
overwhelming
and
refreshing
cant
get
much
smell
out
of
it
and
as
i
drink
the
beer
down
to
better
try
to
understand
the
taste
profile
my
thoughts
keep
moving
to
this
tastes
more
like
a
watered
down
ginger
ale
to
me
i
guess
the
ginger
taste
im
getting
is
a
mix
of
the
coriander
and
salt
kind
of
disappointing
for
me
but
not
a
bad
beer
for
fans
of
this
style
in
my
ever
so
humble
opinion
nonetheless
i
am
excited
try
some
of
the
other
off
color
offerings
really
disappointed
with
the
front
tartness
overall
an
nicely
balanced
fairly
enjoyable
beer
but
not
exciting
or
to
me
within
style
enough
bottle
shared
with
a
friend
at
world
of
beer
in
gainesville
pours
hazy
yellowish
white
colored
with
a
creamy
white
head
on
top
aroma
of
bananas
clove
yeasty
funk
pears
coriander
as
expected
here
flavor
follows
with
sweet
bananas
yeast
corander
a
bit
of
honey
mouthfeel
is
heavy
for
the
style
with
big
rich
flavors
alongside
adequate
to
plus
carbonation
overall
a
decent
rendition
of
the
styledescribed
as
a
witbier
but
here
looks
to
be
a
gose
as
a
witbier
it
falls
a
little
short
as
a
gose
its
better
than
others
ive
had
i
would
drink
it
again
smells
like
buttered
popcorn
is
that
diacetyl
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
knowledge
or
experience
with
beer
flaws
despite
that
its
not
bad
but
not
great
either
hard
to
rate
this
beer
cause
its
good
as
a
saison
w
coriander
but
pretty
disappointing
as
a
gose
not
nearly
tart
enough
very
thin
bone
white
head
covers
the
surface
before
a
swift
dissolve
to
just
an
accumulation
along
the
glass
sides
no
real
lacing
either
metallic
yellow
color
has
good
shine
to
compensate
for
overall
paleness
not
any
bubbles
but
whats
there
are
large
and
active
the
nose
is
on
the
flat
side
yeast
iron
flecks
wet
straw
brown
dirt
the
mixed
white
citrus
struggles
to
maintain
presence
minimal
peach
apricot
fruit
scents
funky
on
the
whole
albeit
more
sugary
as
it
warms
mediumbodied
heavily
carbonated
with
an
active
churn
in
the
mouth
corn
syrup
kind
of
sweetness
dough
honey
and
lemondrops
cant
say
it
is
easy
to
discern
any
coriander
although
there
is
an
undistinguished
cooking
spice
thing
there
peach
yellow
apple
to
cherry
flavors
the
wheat
is
clearer
here
comes
off
more
as
bread
than
uncooked
dough
semitart
ending
tries
to
play
up
earthiness
but
again
more
metallic
than
the
former
for
its
weight
can
be
refreshing
and
strikes
one
as
a
dinner
table
beer
more
than
a
quaffer
on
its
own
overall
not
bad
nothing
too
special
mild
coriander
which
comes
through
nicely
nice
wheat
and
plenty
of
raw
dough
wheat
with
even
the
tartness
of
raw
dough
and
lemony
notes
enjoyable
for
a
summer
style
beer
or
a
super
hot
summer
like
day
in
fall
as
in
today
the
beer
is
light
golden
with
small
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aromas
of
sourdough
bread
funky
malt
light
spice
particularly
coriander
wheat
theres
an
odd
rubbery
scent
in
there
as
well
but
i
cant
decide
how
distracting
it
is
sour
earthy
flavor
tart
lemonlike
qualities
an
interesting
take
on
a
gose
unusual
and
worth
a
try
meh
beer
finishes
dry
and
sour
almost
a
puckering
tartness
at
times
but
is
a
unique
beer
that
has
a
little
bit
of
everything
and
is
pretty
good
excellent
unique
beer
easy
to
drink
nice
balance
of
flavors
tastewheat
spicy
yeast
faint
coriander
a
pinch
of
salt
in
the
finish
lightbodied
faintly
tart
and
very
refreshing
and
quenching
a
fine
match
for
a
blue
cheese
salad
or
light
fish
entree
again
this
is
decent
but
the
salt
is
just
way
too
dominant
in
this
one
it
needs
some
more
flavors
to
balance
it
out
brewed
with
brett
so
ill
throw
a
bottle
or
two
in
the
basement
for
a
bit
and
see
how
it
turns
out
very
fruity
and
a
touch
tart
different
but
nice
overall
this
brew
has
subtleties
and
little
sex
appeal
i
e
not
barrel
aged
not
very
sour
or
hoppy
but
is
quite
a
nice
sip
nonetheless
its
likely
too
sweet
it
would
be
more
quaffable
if
somewhat
drier
or
perhaps
more
highly
carbonated
additionally
the
lactobacillus
may
underdeliver
but
its
subtlety
is
commendable
it
looks
like
a
berliner
weiße
or
belgian
witbier
with
a
light
straw
gold
body
thats
gently
hazy
and
a
short
but
creamy
bright
white
head
the
smell
is
a
touch
offputting
at
first
to
me
it
smells
like
spent
grain
and
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
that
old
bar
smell
where
dripping
draft
lines
have
left
small
puddles
of
beer
in
some
unseen
area
covered
in
white
mold
beyond
that
theres
coriander
and
the
combination
gives
a
bit
of
a
wet
straw
or
damp
plywood
character
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
the
flavor
of
the
lactobacilus
coming
in
right
up
front
followed
by
bright
coriander
and
then
sweet
malt
that
gently
fades
away
its
tart
but
not
overtly
so
and
the
balance
of
tart
going
to
sweet
is
interesting
oddly
i
find
it
a
bit
salty
as
well
and
i
see
that
its
listed
on
beer
advocate
as
a
gose
beer
but
thats
not
on
the
label
nor
is
salt
listed
as
a
secret
ingredient
but
of
course
it
is
i
checked
their
website
so
now
it
all
makes
sense
well
thats
great
personally
i
find
the
salt
a
bit
strong
but
thats
up
to
the
brewer
to
decide
its
curious
charming
and
ultimately
refreshing
and
enjoyable
its
not
the
best
gose
bier
ive
had
but
im
impressed
and
ill
have
to
try
seek
out
and
sample
more
beers
from
them
interesting
but
ultimately
distasteful
enjoy
gose
very
much
but
found
the
lacto
way
too
prominent
to
the
extent
that
taste
devolvd
to
sour
milk
aftertastes
seemed
a
relatively
nicely
made
beer
would
try
the
brewery
again
maybe
just
a
bottle
that
wasnt
the
best
a
very
different
and
interesting
beer
easy
to
drink
with
the
low
4
3
abv
pretty
unique
taste
light
but
full
of
flavor
lots
of
spices
that
dance
on
the
tongue
o
while
its
not
the
greatest
gose
ive
ever
had
troublesome
is
definitely
a
worthwhile
beer
drinkable
o
well
done
brew
i
am
drinking
this
in
the
chicago
area
tonight
august
12th
2014
first
saw
this
on
beer
temple
with
chris
quinn
from
chicago
when
it
apparently
was
not
yet
in
bottles
got
this
bottle
in
asheville
nc
and
have
been
carrying
it
with
me
i
thought
it
was
appropriate
love
this
one
perhaps
my
favourite
of
the
goses
so
far
very
nice
a
little
lacking
on
sourness
but
great
mineral
character
this
poured
yellow
and
with
a
scant
head
of
white
foam
the
nose
was
sweet
with
wheat
and
had
some
earthy
coriander
on
it
it
smelled
like
it
had
some
tartness
and
some
salt
to
it
sweet
lemon
peel
the
taste
was
malt
forward
sweet
wheat
which
was
dry
and
a
bit
crisp
but
the
coriander
made
it
earthy
and
taste
heavy
the
lemon
was
sweet
and
i
wanted
to
taste
tartness
there
was
no
saline
or
salty
finish
and
it
did
not
finish
dry
it
tasted
like
cereal
grain
after
a
while
and
was
bland
and
dull
i
did
not
think
this
was
a
good
representation
of
the
style
even
for
a
wheat
beer
it
drank
blandly
and
without
much
flavor
a
different
take
on
the
style
a
great
session
brew
although
not
exactly
on
point
for
a
gose
on
a
side
note
i
really
like
the
artwork
layout
printing
of
the
label
very
cool
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
however
the
salt
is
only
noticeable
in
the
finish
o
i
can
tell
that
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
and
there
are
a
lot
of
different
things
that
seem
to
stand
out
its
like
drinking
a
very
light
wheat
beer
but
that
sour
edge
makes
it
a
really
great
variation
i
actually
expected
more
salt
flavor
but
am
glad
it
wasnt
there
because
of
the
low
alcohol
content
this
is
something
i
could
sit
and
drink
a
lot
of
overall
its
ok
but
it
just
tastes
like
a
salty
wheat
beer
bright
orange
color
medium
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
peppery
spicy
flowery
and
generally
pleasant
very
likable
thus
far
taste
is
crisply
dry
floral
and
spice
nice
white
bread
malty
and
well
balanced
just
a
touch
of
salt
makes
things
interesting
no
overwhelming
flavors
and
nicely
light
perfect
for
spring
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
nothing
like
a
locallymade
sixpack
of
gose
on
the
shelves
right
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
brassy
gold
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
cracked
wheat
coriander
orange
zest
lemon
zest
and
a
touch
of
black
pepper
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
a
mildbutstilldefinitelyverypresent
tartness
pervading
throughout
accentuating
and
complementing
the
wheat
the
body
is
a
strong
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
pretty
solid
gose
something
i
could
easily
drink
plenty
of
in
the
coming
months
overall
my
first
beer
in
the
gose
style
troublesome
did
not
disappoint
a
friend
of
mine
assured
me
it
was
one
of
the
best
particularly
for
summer
with
that
said
find
some
shade
and
try
this
it
will
surely
not
disappoint
overall
one
of
the
better
goses
i
have
had
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
with
some
excellent
flavors
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
one
osolid
gose
easy
drinking
and
good
flavor
profile
fairly
on
point
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
solid
but
i
like
the
one
choc
makes
more
t
lemon
a
touch
of
coriander
and
some
ginger
right
away
the
middle
hovers
between
a
sort
of
grainy
grassy
hop
bitterness
and
a
salty
sourness
finish
shows
a
kiss
of
salt
wheat
and
some
grainy
sweetness
ends
very
clean
i
could
definitely
drink
a
lot
of
this
on
the
whole
an
easygoing
and
eminently
drinkable
beer
that
nevertheless
displays
enough
complexity
and
nuance
to
remain
interesting
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
over
the
summer
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
and
solid
brew
o
this
is
my
first
american
gose
and
i
am
finding
it
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
not
as
salty
or
tart
as
the
few
german
goses
i
have
tried
worth
picking
up
othis
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
unlike
some
american
gose
this
doesnt
overwhelm
with
salt
but
lets
it
hang
out
in
the
background
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
refreshing
but
there
is
just
enough
intrigue
and
flavor
to
keep
my
palate
from
getting
bored
i
will
try
more
of
this
i
think
overall
i
am
really
growing
to
love
this
style
and
this
one
is
pretty
accessible
i
am
not
a
session
beer
kind
of
guy
but
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
a
great
summer
beer
very
easy
to
drink
an
enjoyable
if
not
restrained
gose
more
of
a
session
or
crisptasting
beer
than
a
super
salty
beer
i
would
like
a
bit
more
salt
taste
but
still
this
is
enjoyable
and
smooth
with
fine
mouthfeel
a
bit
mellow
in
aroma
but
again
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
not
offputting
in
any
way
refreshing
and
worthy
of
more
in
the
future
very
refreshing
brew
very
well
made
i
like
that
the
citrus
character
is
prevalent
poured
into
a
tallgrass
brewing
cervoise
glass
produces
a
fizzy
finger
of
white
head
hazy
straw
colored
body
on
the
nose
a
bit
of
musty
tang
wheat
peppery
yeast
and
some
salt
smells
saison
like
taste
is
peppery
yeast
some
lactic
tang
restrained
salt
lemon
tartness
and
a
nice
wheat
finish
low
carbonation
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
very
creamy
and
smooth
prickly
and
slightly
dry
im
no
expert
on
gose
but
the
tartness
and
salt
are
quite
restrained
however
its
refreshing
and
will
for
sure
be
a
good
summer
beer
if
you
told
me
this
was
some
experimental
saison
id
believe
you
a
good
warm
weather
sipping
beer
interesting

overall
this
is
just
an
allround
enjoyable
brew
its
a
gose
that
doesnt
overdo
it
and
strikes
a
very
good
balance
love
to
have
it
again
this
is
akin
to
a
blue
moon
but
instead
of
moving
to
the
orange
its
lemon
flavors
make
it
more
drinkable
top
it
off
with
a
stronger
wheat
presence
this
stands
as
a
really
good
session
beer
overall
my
first
gose
style
beer
but
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
an
excellently
crafted
brew
multiple
layers
and
interesting
complexity
keep
the
drinker
on
their
toes
hopefully
i
can
get
my
hands
on
more
stuff
from
off
color
interesting
beer
a
nice
take
on
a
gose
off
colors
revival
of
gose
is
a
discovery
of
taste
and
the
mind
and
the
palate
is
transported
to
a
time
thats
perhaps
unimaginable
yet
this
beer
exists
in
all
its
wheaty
sour
and
minerally
demeanor
o
if
it
werent
for
the
tart
and
acidic
addition
of
lactobacillus
troublesome
would
be
very
witbieresque
as
its
bountiful
with
soft
wheat
and
coriander
spice
but
this
germanstyle
gose
makes
for
an
incredibly
easy
drinking

and
refreshing

12oz
bottle
that
i
believe
i
paid
3

for
which
if
this
is
gose
then
i
guess
they
priced
it
to
be
in
line
with
imported
gose
either
way
its
not
cheap
for
a
bottle
of

wheat
beer
appearance
is
a
hazy
yelloworange
ok
head
aroma
is
a
slight
bit
of
bile
at
first
which
must
be
from
teh
lacto
maybe
not
the
bile
subsides
and
then
a
decent
wheat
aroma
takes
over
the
flavor
was
quite
mild
and
easy
to
drink
wheat
and
yeast
but
i
didnt
really
taste
any
saltiness
at
all
pours
a
murky
light
yelloworange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
malt
wheat
lemon
and
coriander
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
wheat
lemon
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
fairly
light
and
refreshing
olove
the
labels
and
also
love
the
fact
that
they
brewed
a
gose
in
a
12
oz
bottle
at
a
very
reasonable
price
the
beer
itself
isnt
half
bad
as
well
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
minimal
head
the
nose
starts
with
a
heavy
cereal
malt
wheat
component
very
bready
with
waves
of
lemon
and
notes
of
coriander
the
predominant
note
is
grain
the
flavor
starts
with
a
light
dry
and
tart
note
and
quickly
gives
way
to
heavy
bready
wheat
notes
the
finish
brings
in
some
citrus
notes
and
is
quite
dry
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
highly
carbonated
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
berliner
with
less
tartness
and
more
malt
character
definitely
not
your
average
run
of
the
mill
6
pack
brew
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
offering
in
a
style
that
i
personally
enjoy
but
just
do
not
see
nearly
enough
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
o
very
happy
to
try
this
one
thanks
jer
o
similar
to
a
berliner
weiss
would
drink
during
the
summer
this
is
the
first
beer
i
had
from
off
color
and
while
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
it
has
some
good
things
going
for
it
i
will
follow
this
brewery
to
see
what
is
next
overall
good
the
pour
is
a
slight
haze
golden
yellow
with
a
one
inch
white
head
the
aroma
is
husky
wheat
grain
lemon
tart
citrus
and
sea
salt
the
taste
is
the
wheat
character
lemon
citrus
grass
coriander
and
a
bit
of
salt
in
the
finish
tasty
stuff
the
palate
is
light
to
medium
bodied
soft
carbonation
and
the
lightly
tart
clean
finish
really
nice
use
of
lacto
in
a
lower
abv
wheat
beer
beautiful
packaging
here
and
we
need
more
six
packs
of
gose
regardless
of
their
price
this
one
was
a
bit
absurd
the
beer
is
bright
blonde
yellow
with
very
little
cloudiness
and
a
short
lived
half
inch
of
white
airy
bubbles
it
smells
less
like
coriander
and
more
like
a
short
lacto
fermentation
tart
but
not
real
dry
the
wheat
malt
is
also
hopelessly
plain
not
bready
not
fresh
or
seasonally
interesting
but
generic
and
unremarkable
in
aroma
and
in
flavor
fortunately
there
is
enough
else
going
on
in
this
one
the
corriander
is
more
like
seed
than
fresh
herb
toasty
and
clean
not
perfumy
or
overdone
in
any
way
the
salt
adds
more
body
and
minerality
than
flavor
but
its
presence
is
there
throughout
strange
yeast
in
the
finish
not
as
tart
as
it
could
be
with
some
sweetness
left
over
light
alcohol
makes
it
real
easy
drinking
but
more
robust
carbonation
and
a
dryer
finish
could
really
push
it
to
the
next
level
an
enjoyable
and
sessionable
gose
in
a
format
i
appreciate
but
this
prices
me
out
a
bit
and
frankly
isnt
any
better
than
most
other
american
made
goses
out
there
o
i
bought
this
thinking
it
was
a
berliner
weisse
but
still
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
would
buy
again
pour
is
bright
golden
yellow
hazy
with
a
tight
white
head
nose
has
a
fair
bit
of
wheat
malt
notes
of
lemon
strong
salt
aroma
and
a
touch
of
iodine
taste
is
more
integrated
and
cleaner
lemon
is
brighter
and
most
prominent
flavor
wheat
is
blended
underneath
and
the
salt
is
very
light
through
the
back
very
light
body
with
a
soft
feel
and
inviting
carbonation
very
easy
sipper
overall
a
very
solid
offering
from
off
color
my
first
and
only
brew
from
them
but
would
definitely
want
to
try
more
from
them
lactobacillus
isnt
normally
the
brewers
friend
but
it
shows
up
in
this
beer
in
spades
im
not
a
sour
beer
noob
but
im
not
a
big
fan
either
i
have
to
say
that
i
bought
this
not
expecting
a
sour
beer
i
probably
should
have
known
better
when
i
saw
wheat
beer
and
coriander
on
the
label
both
traditional
ingredients
in
gose
ive
certainly
had
much
better
sour
beer
but
this
wasnt
awful
any
brewer
willing
to
play
with
lacto
is
rather
courageous
and
for
that
they
should
be
commended
also
not
the
beer
to
have
after
eating
chili
o
quite
light
and
refreshing
tart
funkiness
adds
character
and
flavor
d
not
too
shabby
nice
to
see
a
new
brewery
tackle
this
style
which
not
that
many
american
crafts
are
tackling
fair
effort
not
sure
how
old
this
bottle
was
but
i
wish
they
would
do
some
coding
worth
a
try
regardless
o
i
am
often
skeptical
of
lafflers
beers
as
i
find
them
to
be
more
of
an
expression
of
his
ego
than
his
ability
but
i
must
admit
this
was
a
pleasant
beer
that
was
better
than
expected
m
lighter
side
of
medium
on
the
body
poured
into
an
euler
stange
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
amber
with
a
fine
half
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
wheat
coriander
light
lemon
citrus
flavor
starts
with
sweet
wheat
coriander
and
citrus
then
transitions
and
finishes
with
increasing
light
lemon
and
lactic
tartness
light
bodied
with
great
active
carbonation
a
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
gose
there
is
a
nice
wheat
base
and
the
mild
tartness
in
the
finish
is
deftly
done
and
fit
with
the
other
flavors
i
really
like
this
gose
qit
a
bit
probably
a
bit
less
tart
than
traditional
but
more
to
my
taste
nice
balance
this
was
my
first
goes
and
didnt
know
what
to
exactly
expect
i
must
say
that
this
beer
is
deliciously
refreshing
the
sourness
was
present
bit
not
at
all
overpowering
very
slightly
tart
with
some
coriander
tang
and
wheatearthiness
coming
through
head
was
thin
and
lacing
was
thin
too
it
was
missing
something
taste
wise
was
a
very
pleasant
straw
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
carbonation
seemed
right
for
the
style
but
could
have
been
calmed
down
a
little
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
look
forward
to
drinking
it
this
summer
quite
nice
try
some
o
gose
is
still
a
bit
new
to
me
only
having
tried
a
few
of
them
but
this
is
really
enjoyable
and
best
consumed
colder
than
room
temperature
weird
beer
smelled
interesting
but
doesnt
really
deliver
what
im
looking
for
on
the
palate
it
sounds
rather
interesting
and
is
certainly
a
sessionable
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
if
offered
however
its
not
something
ill
seek
out
again
off
color
brewing
troublesome
45
gose
seems
to
be
making
the
rounds
of
americas
breweries
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
ive
had
soft
coriander
tangy
wheat
and
a
drying
saltiness
make
for
an
immensely
refreshing
and
slammable
beer
good
job
fellas
o
really
basic
but
nuanced
in
flavor
and
complexity
at
the
same
time
all
the
flavors
going
on
at
the
same
time
were
nice
and
id
happily
have
this
again
note
six
packs
are
9

in
chicago
if
youre
paying
more
you
have
your
local
distributorretailer
to
thank
a
very
simple
easy
to
drink
brew
not
a
lot
of
character
but
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
very
impressed
with
this
beer
very
true
to
style
just
the
right
amount
of
tart
and
saltiness
a
very
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
to
be
sure
cant
wait
to
have
more
o
definitely
my
favorite
beer
of
the
night
a
bit
of
sweetness
mixed
with
the
mild
tartness
makes
this
interesting
yet
it
remains
drinkable
and
moreish
looking
forward
to
this
in
distributed
format
really
into
goses
now
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
overall
delicious
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
would
love
to
try
more
funky
buddha
now
having
had
this
just
fantastic
funky
buddha
makes
a
number
of
outstanding
fruitinfused
sour
beers
and
this
one
is
perhaps
my
favorite
i
really
wish
i
had
easy
access
to
this
amazingly
tasty
and
refreshing
warm
weather
treat
not
super
familiar
with
goses
but
this
one
is
salty
as
hell
and
i
like
it
pale
straw
color
no
head
the
smell
is
all
passionfruit
and
berry
delight
its
awesome
taste
is
all
salt
up
front
berries
in
the
middle
and
finishes
tartly
crisp
on
the
drier
side
really
wants
you
to
take
another
sip
overall
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
shit
load
of
this
in
the
summer
if
you
cant
find
this
anywhere
and
want
to
get
a
taste
of
it
try
a
chobani
passionfruit
greet
yogurt
basically
the
same
taste
but
with
salt
super
refreshing
and
ridiculously
fruit
forward
the
best
gose
ive
had
funky
buddha
aromatically
is
the
best
brewery
in
the
world
o
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
that
was
quite
interesting
to
try
the
standard
gose
qualities
definitely
made
their
presence
known
and
the
fruit
presence
balanced
nicely
adding
a
nice
complexity
especially
on
the
nose
glad
i
got
to
try
this
at
150
bottles
its
not
going
to
be
easy
to
land
though
overall
quite
refreshing
and
flavorful
i
was
afraid
it
would
taste
like
a
buddha
berliner
but
it
has
avoided
the
pitfalls
from
which
they
suffer
darker
than
your
typical
gose
as
if
barrel
aged
the
aroma
has
a
faint
oaky
sourness
almost
like
balsamic
vinegar
strong
lemon
flavor
characteristics
along
with
a
bit
of
ginger
light
bodied
medium
high
carbonation
much
sweeter
than
the
goses
ive
previously
had
and
with
less
salt
make
me
think
of
radler
but
much
heartier
this
is
a
superb
sour
truly
exceptional
and
quite
impressive
for
this
coming
from
an
american
brewery
very
much
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
should
be
considered
as
a
reason
to
visit
richmond
for
beer
fans
nice
color
perhaps
inappropriately
clear
and
decent
lace
lightly
briny
aroma
with
a
hint
of
cherry
cough
syrup
dry
salty
just
a
bit
of
cherry
sweetness
in
the
flavor
medium
body
fairly
high
carb
reasonably
dry
finish
not
bad
but
this
is
one
of
those
things
that
just
doesnt
work
as
well
as
it
seems
like
it
should
perhaps
heavily
fruiting
a
gose
was
just
unnecessary
either
way
this
beer
probably
would
have
been
better
without
the
cherry
ive
heard
that
in
germany
gose
is
considered
a
womans
beer
thats
ok
with
me
i
wont
say
anything
if
you
wont
victorys
kirsch
is
delicious
and
refreshing
appearance
reminds
me
of
cherry
7up
and
the
taste
is
similar
as
well
with
a
nice
sour
twist
to
it
i
like
it
ive
only
had
a
few
beers
in
this
style
and
i
wouldnt
know
a
good
gose
from
shinola
so
im
no
expert
and
my
ratings
shouldnt
count
for
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
thought
the
beer
was
missing
some
of
the
salinity
that
should
be
present
in
this
style
still
it
was
quite
tasty
and
drinkable
decent
beer
for
summer
when
hot
o
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
nice
mix
of
both
sweet
and
tart
cherry
flavors
and
makes
for
refreshing
easy
drinking
o
a
nice
sour
cherry
beer
at
a
great
price
very
clean
flavors
easy
to
drink
flavor
is
definitely
on
the
american
side
of
the
gose
spectrum
but
not
as
extreme
as
most
the
cherry
character
adds
a
great
character
kinda
like
cherry
pie
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
strawberry
soda
color
bit
of
foam
and
light
lacing
smell
is
very
light
after
it
warms
a
little
it
comes
through
a
bit
of
sweet
bread
malt
and
berry
taste
has
a
bit
of
salt
up
front
with
nice
tart
cherry
follows
with
a
touch
of
the
malt
and
lingering
cherry
feel
is
light
and
slightly
effervescent
very
happy
to
find
this
in
4
packs
at
the
local
grocery
store
not
as
sharp
or
tart
as
a
lot
of
gose
beers
but
it
has
a
solid
flavor
profile
that
isnt
too
saccharine
or
sweet
but
has
a
nice
bouncy
flavor
with
a
good
cherry
flavor
a
good
hit
of
malt
yeast
to
round
out
the
mouthfeel
well
balanced
not
over
sour
like
some
domestic
representations
of
the
style
sweetness
of
the
cherries
on
the
finish
plays
well
with
the
saltiness
up
front
very
sweet
and
grainy
i
dont
get
any
saltiness
on
the
palate
not
really
representative
of
the
style
a
delicious
simple
and
relatively
inexpensive
fruity
and
tangy
gose
from
a
bigger
brewery
i
e
wider
availability
sometimes
youre
just
in
the
mood
for
some
dessert
and
dropping
16
on
a
bomber
of
kriek
boon
or
whatever
is
too
much
of
a
commitment
hopefully
this
and
other
similar
simple
sour
styles
will
end
up
making
its
way
to
more
local
shops
for
indulging
such
desires
overall
fantastic
sour
from
a
large
american
brewery
i
wish
more
breweries
did
these
sort
of
projects
to
further
the
reach
of
sour
beers
to
the
masses
this
isnt
a
cellar
candidate
drink
fresh
just
an
average
beer
nothing
wiring
with
but
nothing
special
tastes
better
the
closer
you
are
to
the
start
of
the
boston
marathon
o
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
come
back
to
flavor
was
almost
nonexistent
so
unique
dont
know
whether
itd
ever
make
it
to
the
top
of
my
beer
list
as
a
must
get
but
this
is
the
first
gose
ive
ever
experienced
malty
goodness
just
rests
on
your
palate
while
still
maintaining
a
refreshing
quench
complete
lack
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
oneofakind
twang
that
ive
never
tasted
before
finishes
with
a
pleasant
spice
note
coriander
poured
from
the
first
set
of
growlers
filled
at
their
jp
brewery
the
beer
pours
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
moderately
the
beer
itself
is
a
clear
light
copper
the
beer
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
thin
lacing
that
lasts
a
while
the
beer
has
a
fairly
light
smell
but
not
out
of
place
for
a
gose
the
notes
tend
to
be
coriander
with
a
light
hop
profile
and
supplemented
by
salt
with
a
hint
of
pepper
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
a
stronger
bitter
hop
and
salt
profile
the
coriander
is
more
of
a
background
taste
that
complements
salt
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
towards
the
light
end
of
medium
bodied
very
refreshing
and
smooth
overall
a
pretty
good
after
workout
beer
and
worth
getting
while
its
available
draught
doyles
this
one
pours
a
hazy
darker
golden
color
it
has
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
lighter
but
nice
aroma
mainly
notes
of
coriander
and
wheat
the
taste
is
good
medium
to
lighter
body
wheat
and
coriander
are
the
main
flavors
no
real
sweetness
or
bitterness
crisp
refreshing
pretty
nice
brew
an
excellent
boston
exclusive
i
wish
it
was
bottled
sigh
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
a
session
beer
o
good
beer
refreshing
and
drinkable
on
tap
at
the
sam
adams
tour
poured
a
hazy
light
orangey
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
coriander
is
well
integrated
with
the
malt
base
taste
is
refreshing
with
good
notes
of
coriander
and
malt
with
light
salty
finish
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
well
brewed
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
to
have
regular
access
during
sumnmertime
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
flavorful
lighter
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
carbonation
moderate
it
felt
very
light
and
refreshing
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
it
seemed
a
little
dumbed
down
from
the
more
traditional
leipziger
version
ive
had
it
tasted
a
little
like
a
slightly
salty
version
of
their
summer
brew
while
it
may
not
be
as
bold
as
a
traditional
version
they
did
a
pretty
good
job
at
incorporating
those
flavors
into
something
the
average
craft
beer
drinker
would
like
very
refreshing
with
more
than
enough
flavor
for
a
lighter
brew
subtly
extreme
mouthfeel
is
good
light
bodied
moderately
carbonated
sorta
prickly
im
sure
itd
be
refreshing
after
running
never
had
a
gose
before
but
its
tastes
like
a
typical
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
wit
or
hefeweisse
bier
26

is
a
tasty
and
remarkably
refreshing
beer
it
really
hit
the
spot
on
this
85
degree
marathon
monday
kudos
to
the
folks
at
sam
adams
for
creating
a
terrific
interpretation
of
this
unfortunately
underrepresented
style
t
grain
and
wheat
with
a
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
a
lingering
hint
of
salt
at
the
back
of
the
throat
on
the
finish
worth
seeking
out
just
to
try
a
gose
drinkable
will
never
try
again

not
a

beer
for
sa
worth
tasting
not
much
hints
at
this
being
a

as
it
has
a
deep

and
a
thick

hints
of

on

the
flavor
is

with

the
coriander
is
more
evident
in
the
finish
as
i
taste
some
lemon
lime
soda
water
as
well
perhaps
a
little
salty
this
seems
to
miss
the
gose
mark
but
i
find
it
good
to
drink
o
not
quite
what
i
expect
for
a
gose
but
still
quite
tasty
it
hits
some
of
the
qualities
but
its
very
mellow
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
risk
here
still
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
from
sam
ive
had
a
little
too
heavy
and
not
enough
salt
i
never
thought
i
would
type
that
about
a
beer
to
me
sometimes
a
style
is
a
certain
way
for
a
certain
reason
so
i
think
putting
your
own
twist
on
a
gose
might
not
be
the
best
direction
this
does
not
come
off
as
refreshing
as
the
other
goes
beers
i
have
had
it
is
worth
a
try
for
the
sheer
novelty
if
you
have
never
had
salt
in
your
beer
the
pour
at
first
glance
can
be
mistaken
for
a
pilsner
except
for
being
a
shade
darker
and
with
more
bubbles
as
ordinary
as
the
pour
looked
the
way
the
beer
smelled
was
anything
but
even
from
an
arms
length
there
was
a
sour
floral
and
mineralized
smell
coming
from
the
glass
which
intensified
when
brought
nearer
this
was
clearly
not
an
ordinary
pilsner
the
taste
stayed
true
to
the
style
but
was
lighter
than
others
of
the
type
ive
had
which
sadly
has
been
only
a
couple
this
was
a
bit
more
tame
in
acidity
and
salt
and
little
sweeter
not
a
bad
taste
at
all
mind
you
just
not
all
that
it
should
be
light
and
crisp
on
the
palette
but
again
softer
and
lacking
that
gose
edge
i
dont
mind
having
had
this
bottle
and
it
is
certainly
different
than
sam
adams
typical
fare
but
i
much
prefer
the
real
german
bottle
or
that
fantastic
recreation
by
westbrook
more
o
cant
say
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
the
fruity
sweet
sour
element
with
the
saltiness
was
just
a
little
too
weird
to
me
for
this
beer
to
be
truly
enjoyable
not
a
repeat
buy
however
kudos
to
sam
adams
for
the
attempt
at
making
this
style
more
available
eric
some
clear
notes
of
wheat
and
coriander
still
present
as
well
as
the
odd
lemon
soda
taste
light
bodied
and
still
somewhat
drinkable
even
though
its
old
theres
still
signs
of
life
would
try
again
if
fresh
o
overall
this
is
a
rather
unique
and
nice
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
a
very
good
example
of
a
gose
o
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
overall
i
quite
enjoyed
it
the
saltiness
aspect
was
interesting
i
think
sam
adams
did
a
good
job
on
this
overall
well
its
unique
ill
say
that
much
not
exactly
my
style
but
its
something
thats
different
and
unique
if
youre
a
beer
geek
and
want
to
try
something
different
this
is
a
good
one
to
pick
up
because
they
are
normally
a
good
price
i
got
mine
at
costco
of
all
places
and
its
something
different
i
dont
think
that
ill
be
getting
another
one
of
these
but
thats
ok
sweet
flavor
up
front
good
fruit
and
mild
spice
the
body
is
medium
with
a
slightly
elevated
carbonation
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
plum
short
lived
certainly
a
taste
different
from
anything
ive
tasted
before
not
really
a
style
i
prefer
but
it
seems
well
crafted
and
i
can
appreciate
how
others
would
enjoy
it
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
i
dont
think
i
would
go
crazy
looking
for
it
at
my
local
beer
spot
but
i
got
this
in
a
sam
adams
variety
pack
and
hit
the
spot
watching
a
little
sunday
football
salud
o
very
ok
has
nice
flavoring
going
on
pours
a
cloudy
straw
gold
color
with
a
thin
quickly
disappearing
white
head
aroma
is
mild
alcohol
pepper
and
malt
the
taste
is
interesting
briny
up
front
yeasty
slightly
sour
not
nearly
like
some
other
gose
ive
tried
fades
to
a
slight
bitter
finish
and
ends
with
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thick
highly
carbonated
with
a
very
dry
finish
overall
this
beer
is
rather
unimpressive
compared
to
the
expected
style
i
doubt
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
this
was
my
first
beer
of
this
style
and
i
thought
it
was
very
good
a
very
delicate
and
fairly
complex
beer
o
the
clean
and
crisp
beer
is
not
overly
dry
and
the
fruity
character
with
the
coriander
add
some
depth
and
the
salt
qualities
remain
in
the
background
this
very
drinkable
but
the
coriander
might
need
other
support
to
make
this
really
sessionable
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
bread
and
coriander
with
a
hint
of
date
or
apricot
very
pleasing
and
drinkable
in
fact
the
more
i
sip
the
better
i
like
it
the
beer
pours
a
ruddy
brown
with
two
solid
inches
of
foam
the
wheat
bill
comes
through
in
the
nose
along
with
corriander
and
some
earthy
yeast
some
mineral
character
full
bodied
with
a
heavy
dose
of
wheat
the
subtle
fruit
character
leads
to
some
mineral
aspect
toward
the
end
spices
follows
coriander
cloves
rounded
out
be
apricot
the
tang
hangs
on
past
the
end
to
leave
the
palate
thirsty
once
again
o
a
fruit
and
somewhat
malty
beer
like
oranges
mixed
with
a
bit
of
the
peel
some
caramel
and
light
bit
of
spice
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
defiantly
off
the
beaten
path
and
worth
the
try
overall
i
think
this
a
good
beer
ive
had
this
beer
before
fresh
and
its
even
better
with
the
clove
and
salt
really
showing
their
stuff
but
as
it
is
now
its
an
okay
beer
it
is
perfect
for
the
summer
heat
however
most
compelling
part
of
this
beer
to
me
is
the
nose
and
that
unique
coconut
profile
overall
impression
a
nice
balance
of
salt
sweet
fruit
and
dryness
this
ale
is
noticeably
different
from
most
other
weizens
or
wheat
beers
because
of
the
salt
added
and
lack
of
hop
bitterness
the
smooth
mouthfeel
and
refreshing
fruitiness
makes
this
a
great
thirst
quencher
but
the
dryness
keeps
you
coming
back
for
swig
after
swig
the
boston
beer
company
doesnt
sell
bad
beers
every
offering
is
well
conceived
and
polished
and
verloren
is
no
exception
well
done
mr
koch
poured
this
gose
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
produced
a
huge
white
creamy
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
toasted
grain
spicy
coriander
and
lemon
citrus
medium
bodied
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
followed
by
spicy
coriander
butter
and
lemon
citrus
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
flavor
a
bit
to
heavy
on
the
thick
buttery
taste
i
feel
it
overshadowed
the
coriander
toasted
malt
and
citrus
a
bit
glad
i
sampled
but
not
a
ale
that
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
a
respectable
beer
not
at
all
a
bad
choice
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
without
some
assurance
that
the
imbalances
of
the
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
had
been
corrected
at
the
very
least
it
got
me
eager
to
try
other
versions
of
the
gose
style
now
the
trick
will
be
finding
some
oi
give
sa
credit
for
brewing
the
style
id
be
interested
in
seeing
what
other
examples
are
out
there
interesting
beer
good
not
exceptional
would
buy
again
if
on
sale
but
wouldnt
specifically
seek
it
out
i
dont
want
to
slam
it
it
was
very
drinkable
and
i
didnt
regret
it
in
the
least
just
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
my
first
gose
and
probably
my
first
beer
with
salt
in
it
at
least
on
purpose
since
ive
never
sampled
the
style
before
and
have
no
comparison
im
assuming
its
a
good
example
of
style
because
sam
adams
is
usually
a
good
example
of
style
poured
into
a
sester
stange
pours
a
medium
golden
amber
with
a
fine
three
finger
ivory
head
constantly
renewed
by
active
carbonation
looks
nice
aroma
of
wheat
coriander
and
light
orange
and
sweet
malt
flavor
of
wheat
light
apple
coriander
and
fruit
esters
finishes
with
light
fruit
residual
coriander
rather
floral
and
a
hint
of
salt
light
and
refreshing
light
bodied
as
expected
from
the
style
a
very
nice
light
flavor
progression
and
combination
enjoyable
gose
such
an
underbrewed
and
underappreciated
style
a
rare
one
here
in
the
usa
and
indeed
the
world
over
these
days
but
this
is
a
gem
crystal
clear
golden
amber
on
the
pour
sparkling
with
bright
carbonation
and
a
few
fingers
of
fine
white
foam
the
nose
is
odd
corriander
for
sure
toasted
lightly
with
some
wheat
malt
and
a
curious
but
mild
yeast
strain
the
salt
of
course
doesnt
have
much
smell
but
it
comes
in
at
the
end
i
taste
sweet
wheat
malt
and
corriander
seeds
and
the
salt
is
more
of
a
finishing
element
leaving
a
unique
mouthfeel
that
is
somehow
both
dry
and
not
dry
at
the
same
time
i
found
this
to
be
much
less
salted
and
mineral
driven
than
some
of
the
other
versions
ive
had
particularly
genuine
european
versions
but
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
the
addition
of
corriander
i
thought
brought
out
a
lot
of
flavor
complexity
a
beer
id
gladly
pay
7
bucks
for
again
o
my
first
experience
with
this
style
so
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
i
liked
the
beer
its
refreshing
overall
a
very
good
but
not
great
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
again
for
friends
that
are
not
beer
nerds
this
is
a
huge
step
up
from
adjunct
lager
dreck
but
highly
accessible
for
the
nonadventurous
quaffer
overall
this
is
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
but
a
lot
of
things
have
to
go
right
to
end
up
with
a
good
gose
a
good
try
but
it
falls
a
little
bit
short
overall
this
is
one
tasty
brew
while
i
do
not
have
much
experience
in
the
gose
category
and
hence
do
not
really
have
a
great
perception
as
of
yet
what
the
ideal
one
tastes
like
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
rather
soft
yet
flavorful
and
quite
drinkable
beer
this
is
definitely
one
to
try
if
you
get
a
chance
o
very
interesting
ale
here
one
that
you
dont
see
very
often
im
glad
to
see
brewers
try
to
bring
some
rare
styles
to
light
i
thought
this
gose
was
tasty
and
think
it
would
be
especially
appreciated
in
warm
weather
i
dont
have
any
other
beers
in
the
style
to
compare
to
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
orly
the
components
for
a
closelybrewedtostylebeer
are
there
but
theres
little
in
the
states
to
compare
verloren
to
fear
not
for
this
beer
is
brewed
very
well
and
tastes
the
part
all
while
playing
the
part
to
revive
a
heritage

from
germany
ya
rly
verloren
is
a
rockin
bottle
from

to
try

and
different
things
overall
its
not

i
dont
know
how
it
compares
to
other
beers
of
the
style
though
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz

has
a
cloudy

color
with
a
12
inch

easy
drinking
feels
full

mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
if
not
quite
impressive
its
very
nicely
complex
and
it
changes
its
character
readily
as
you
progress
through
the
glass
worth
trying

only
had
one

they
were

just

an

with
almost

gose
none
of
the
salt
and
very
low
sour
thats
dominated
by
other
flavors
taste
is
lemony
biscuits
with
a
sharp
lime
peel
i
can
taste
the
salt
but
it
is
nowhere
near
the
tastiness
of
the
other
goses
i
have
had
this
one
is
bleh
something
different
but
not
right
so
not
to
style
no
bueno
gotta
give
it
up
for
sam
for
continuing
to
roll
out
some
new
takes
on
offbeat
styles
this
attempt
at
a
gose
pours
a
lightly
hazy
sunset
goldenstraw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
white
bread
soap
lemon
rind
the
waxy
outermost
part
of
the
rind
light
coriander
and
a
kiss
of
babys
breath
the
taste
unfortunately
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
soap
really
coming
forth
as
the
frontrunner
i
get
hardly
any
citrus
character
and
whatever
spice
notes
are
there
are
meek
at
best
busy
being
consumed
by
the
soapy
bread
enveloping
them
needless
to
say
the
whole
experience
is
unpleasant
leaving
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
literally
for
once
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
insipid
gose
one
that
doesnt
come
close
to
exhibiting
any
of
the
characteristics
of
the
style
all
of
the
top
four
google
translate
definitions
of
verloren
apply
here
something
was
definitely
lost
in
translation
the
effort
comes
across
as
wasted
and
retrospectively
potentially
doomed
to
failure
and
i
am
forlorn
after
having
partaken
of
it
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
tasted
with
a
friend
we
both
detected
the
coriander
and
really
thought
this
beer
was
well
made
i
enjoyed
the
tartness
and
subtleness
of
the
spicesalt
combination
a
bit
less
lactic
than
my
favorites
of
the
style
this
is
still
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
since
this
is
my
first
gose
im
not
quite
sure
what
to
say
about
how
to
compares
to
other
goses
but
this
is
at
least
doable
for
me

quite
liked
this
beer
despite
the
bad
reviews
it
has
some
very
nice
fruity
notes
but
also
some
spicy
notes
tastes
like
a
fall
beer
or
so
also
pretty

with
a
dry
peppery
and
notes
of
lemon
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
a
malty
wheat
beer
interesting
beer
and
it
seems
to
fit
the
style
yet
i
am
used
to
a
little
more
carbonation
in
this
beer
style
this
is
a
quite
average
brew
reminds
me
of
bells
oberon
mixed
with
blue
moon
a
gose
should
be
more
interesting
than
this
this
is
very
pedestrian
and
im
wouldnt
buy
it
again
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
bodied
and
goes
down
easy
it
has
a
smooth
finish
and
makes
for
quenchable
drinker
the
first
time
have
had
a
gose
beer
and
it
was
worth
a
try
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
amber
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
stickage
smells
of
spicy
wheat
and
a
pepper
with
hints
of
earth
and
salt
it
kind
of
smells
like
a
peppery
macro
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
sweet
with
honey
like
malts
a
bit
of
a
spicy
peppery
bite
to
mix
things
up
a
bit
as
well
as
a
bit
of
mineral
earthiness
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
sweet
mouthfeel
kind
of
an
easy
drinking
brew
a
bit
different
its
only
my
second
gose
but
i
think
i
liked
the
bruery
version
a
little
better
overall
very
approachable
with
a
nice
flavor
element
but
i
am
afraid
the
style
is
not
among
my
favorites
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
pours
cloudy
golden
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
there
are
plenty
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
and
side
of
the
glass
the
quantity
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
decreases
after
the
initial
pour
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
sticky
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
bright
orange
fills
the
nose
along
with
coriander
malt
and
hops
it
has
that
classic
inviting
wheat
ale
smell
coriander
orange
peel
malt
and
hops
blend
well
to
create
a
tasty
brew
if
i
hadnt
seen
salt
listed
as
an
ingredient
i
might
not
have
been
looking
for
it
as
it
stands
there
is
a
mild
saltiness
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
the
aftertaste
is
not
strong
the
body
is
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
dry
finish
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
is
an
interesting
addition
to
the
samuel
adams
lineup
this
gose
was
for
the
birds
overall
this
is
good
beer
and
certainly
intriguing
the
witbier
and
coriander
notes
when
combined
with
lovely
fruit
esters
and
breads
strike
a
nice
balance
and
work
well
together
i
did
find
the
flavors
eversoslightly
watery
which
was
especially
present
after
several
sips
were
taken
in
a
row
and
the
flavors
diminished
somewhat
but
this
is
a
still
a
very
nice
addition
to
adams
limited
release
series
rjt
o
my
first
gose
has
some
good
things
going
on
but
at
the
same
time
doesnt
make
me
want
to
seek
out
others
in
the
style
o
ive
never
had
an
authentic
german
gose
so
i
cant
really
determine
how
closely
verloren
follows
in
the
footsteps
of
traditional
examples
of
the
style
im
assuming
it
doesnt
though
as
ive
been
led
to
believe
that
a
gose
is
generally
tart
and
salty
verloren
though
is
predominantly
sweet
spicy
and
waxy
odd
with
an
unappealing
texture
that
makes
it
very
difficult
to
drink
i
doubt
ill
revisit
this
one
interesting
very
strong
coriander
forward
didnt
really
detect
the
salt
o
i
was
not
expecting
much
out
of
this
beer
to
be
honest
mostly
because
its
a
very
uncommon
style
of
beer
and
usually
thats
for
a
good
reason
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
not
as
strange
as
i
was
expecting
and
i
wish
more
breweries
would
have
a
go
at
this
style
because
i
think
its
untouched
territory
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
6
packs
and
i
think
if
there
was
a
bigger
version
of
this
beer
that
it
would
be
a
real
killer
for
bombers
still
i
recommend
you
try
it
out
overall
an
interesting
experimental
brew
never
had
an
example
of
this
style
so
comparisons
are
not
possible
pretty
simple
flavors
though
pours
a
hazy
orangish
gold
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
which
recedes
to
edging
and
leaves
a
few
fingers
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
malt
up
front
and
then
a
nice
big
corriander
aroma
with
a
hint
of
salt
at
the
end
the
aroma
is
inviting
the
taste
follows
suit
the
base
is
off
malt
after
the
malt
the
corriander
takes
the
show
as
the
main
flavor
after
the
corriander
comes
a
slight
hint
of
salt
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
solid
beer
it
is
an
easy
drink
and
refreshing
it
is
a
good
beer
worth
a
try
for
sure
poured
a
1
5
offwhite
head
of
medium
lifespan
the
body
is
a
lovely
slightly
hazed
golden
orange
the
mild
smell
is
malt
coriander
and
if
salt
has
an
actual
smell
i
think
i
do
get
that
too
taste
is
mild
and
mirrors
the
smell
and
the
salt
expresses
in
the
medium
long
finish
all
in
all
i
found
this
quite
enjoyable
though
its
certainly
not
a
powerhouse
from
a
marketing
standpoint
i
dont
see
why
this
beer
is
nicknamed
the
lost
beer
malted
and
unmalted

i

man
is
this

i

really
it
just

never

is

exciting
as
some
of
the

sour
beers
in
cans
but
also
because
theyre
so
readily
available
whats
even
more
exciting
is
that
here
gose
nothin
also
happens
to
be
damn
good
quite
a
bit
more
sour
than
a
traditional
gose
this
iteration
keeps
its
flavor
profile
in
line
with
some
of
the
german
classics
for
a
delicious
and
crushable
sour
beer
i
guess
i
dont
like
sours
bc
this
tasted
like
the
worst
sour
patch
kid
mixed
with
salt
and
vomit
on

for

night
at
the

in

week
2014
my
first
gose
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
it
reminded
me
of
a
berliner
weisse
in
terms
of
tartness
but
with
the
wheat
character
and
chewiness
of
a
wit
beer
or
light
wheat
beer
thrown
in
very
light
clean
and
refreshing
aroma
was
heavy
on
the
coriander
taste
was
similar
with
an
herbal
bitterness
and
tealike
impression
due
to
the
heavy

coriander
addition
also
hot

tart
lemon
lactobacillus
this
wasnt

you

can
the
offnotes
were
nearly
overpowering
any
decent
flavors
were
a
brief
flash
between
weirdnesses
if
there
was
more
of
a
head
and
if
it
was
fluffier
instead
of
comprised
of
tiny
bubbles
this
would
look

a
solid
dipa

of

and
a

would
be

with

slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
that
most
gose
beers
ive
had
or
remembered
but
still
refreshingly
crisp
and
effervescent
really
tasty
overall
the
beer
was
good
for
the
style
some
fruit
notes
balance
the
sourness
light
body
good
for
hot
summer
days
good
overall
rating
would
be
higher
but
other
two
sours
i
had
recently
were
a
little
better
o
solid
gose
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
is
a
nice
option
for
warm
summer
days
overall
an
excellent
beer
well
put
together
and
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
nice
gose
flavorful
with
a
nice
sourness
ive
recently
started
enjoying
sours
this
was
worth
trying
but
honestly
the
salt
in
the
taste
was
overpowering
i
liked
the
tart
sour
character
and
malty
backbone
but
just
couldnt
get
past
the
salt
good
stuff
poured
a
cloudy
orange
body
with
one
finger
of
thick
fluffy
white
head
a
very
nice
looking
beer
scents
of
salt
water
delicate
german
malt
aromas
a
light
lactic
sourness
light
bready
malt
and
a
light
fruit
ester
presence
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
of
a
true
to
form
gose
very
nice
flavor
begins
highly
sour
with
notes
of
lemon
zest
lemon
juice
and
a
slight
lactic
sourness
and
a
mediumlight
saltiness
balancing
the
sourness
middle
opens
up
further
sourness
along
with
a
light
hint
of
grainy
malt
finish
is
dry
and
highly
sour
with
notes
of
grainy
malt
lemon
juice
and
salt
water
aftertaste
is
sour
lactic
acid
lemon
juice
fading
to
grainy
malt
overall
impression
of
flavor
is
of
a
good
gose
that
tends
more
towards
the
sour
side
of
the
style
a
good
take
on
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
sour
puckering
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
true
to
style
gose
nothing
wrong
overall
this
is
a
good
gose
it
has
a
nice
sour
flavor
fitting
the
style
keeping
the
saltiness
present
and
complementary
and
having
an
excellent
aroma
and
mouthfeel
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
i
like
sours
couldnt
get
into
this
one
though
solid
gose
mixed
with
a
bunch
of
funk
sourness
i
loved
it
the
aftertaste
keeps
you
puckered
up
i
am
going
to
follow
this
with
another
anderson
gose
so
i
hope
this
stuff
doesnt
make
me
sick
im
a
fan
glad
to
see
this
on
the
shelves
at
my
local
whole
foods
pours
amber
in
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smell
has
aromas
of
acidic
sour
aroma
with
notes
of
apples
pears
and
coriander
taste
is
intensly
souracidic
and
somewhat
salty
really
intensely
sour
gose
with
a
mineraly
dry
finish
not
the
traditional
gose
i
was
expecting
but
a
good
sour
bomb
non
the
less
how
do
you
rate
something
like
this
says
gose
on
the
can
but
doesnt
look
or
taste
like
a
tradition
gose
thats
not
to
say
its
bad
its
actually
quite
good
but
not
a
typical
gose
darker
a
bit
heavier
it
has
a
meaty
aroma
and
taste
much
less
dry
with
fruit
like
flavor
characteristics
lots
of
coriander
light
body
and
high
carbonation
poured
out
the
can
into

man
it
was

the
flavor
is
fantastically
balanced
for
a
canned
sour
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
such
a
long
time
and
i
dont
know
if
i
can
ever
go
back
very
sour
just
as
good
as
westbrook
gose
but
a
bit
less
salty
really
refreshing
salty
and
tart
i
dont
understand
how
this
could
be
appealing
it
tasted
like
a
homemade
batch
gone
horribly
wrong
i
just
dont
get
it
my
daughter
loves
it
though
shes
22
what
does
she
know
i
would
work
this
into
my
regular
rotation
if
it
wasnt
4
a
can
mild
saltiness
balanced
malts
nice
easy
finish
might
be
my
favorite
gose
not
a
big
blast
of
coriander
like
some
gosewestbrook
mouthfeel
is
good
and
i
think
its
a
good
sour
wow
super
sour
almost
too
much
to
enjoy
it
stick
with
cantillon
a
little
darker
in
color
and
saltier
than
most
gose
very
good
but
there
are
better
options
received
this
as
an
extra
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
got
a
great
smell
with
the
taste
just
coming
in
a
little
below
like
a
nonsalty
version
of
westbrook
overall
really
enjoyed
it
and
look
forward
to
more
in
the
future
destihl
brewery
is
now
on
my
beerdar
a
great
gose
maybe
the
most
sour
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
so
much
pucker
here
and
a
bigger
malt
bill
and
body
than
i
am
used
to
in
the
style
more
than
just
wheat
or
more
deeply
toasted
wheat
that
gives
both
a
light
amber
color
and
a
bunch
of
body
to
this
its
hazy
and
weird
looking
for
the
style
though
and
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
head
it
certainly
doesnt
hold
it
long
the
nose
is
light
on
the
coriander
and
heavy
on
the
lacto
sour
fermented
as
much
as
it
is
traditional
sour
mash
or
kettle
sour
in
its
complexion
where
is
where
its
mature
sourness
comes
from
i
have
to
imagine
the
salt
is
light
in
the
flavor
but
it
adds
body
and
accents
the
sourness
really
well
i
didnt
no
know
they
canned
this
or
anything
so
its
cool
to
imagine
it
in
that
context
too
ive
never
had
such
a
sour
one
of
these
though
its
almost
caustic
and
hurts
the
drinkability
that
the
style
is
supposed
to
have
its
also
a
little
slower
down
because
of
all
the
body
but
i
cant
help
but
be
impressed
with
this
overall
its
dynamic
and
fun
and
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
around
a
little
more
carbonation
would
really
help
but
i
like
this
a
lot
as
it
is
appreciably
different
bravo
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
gose
to
date
it
is
tart
without
destroying
you
with
sour
and
it
is
incredibly
refreshing
i
would
drink
this
while
mowing
the
yard
all
the
time
in
the
summer
too
bad
its
december
destihl
brewery
here
gose
nothin
45
first
offering
from
destihl
this
is
a
tart
refreshing
beer
however
it
is
not
brewed
to
style
and
has
a
bit
of
an
overwhelming
lime
flavor
not
sure
where
to
rate
it
because
i
usually
rate
to
style
as
a
gose
it
is
3
00
as
a
refreshingly
tart
beer
it
is
probably
3
75
ill
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
westbrook
is
far
better
and
boulevard
hibiscus
gose
is
more
enjoyable
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
so
i
guess
i
learned
a
thing
about
prejudice
or
maybe
i
didnt
i
still
dont
like
the
vibe
these
guys
put
off
but
i
have
to
give
credit
where
its
due
this
beer
is
excellent
oh
my
heavens
this
is
the
absolute
best
gose
ive
ever
had
that
wasnt
from
germany
this
is
right
up
there
with
ritterguts
i
am
a
fan
of
destihl
but
this
was
just
amazing
if
you
like
sours
you
will
love
this
you
get
an
initial
love
bite
right
off
the
bat
but
then
it
becomes
apparent
there
is
alot
of
flavor
behind
it
i
think
this
is
the
first
gose
i
have
had
in
a
can
so
wasnt
that
excited
about
it
initially
but
im
a
believer
now
get
some
of
this
overall
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
happy
to
see
it
hit
our
market
to
me
this
one
was
slightly
better
than
westbrooks
gose
which
gets
a
ton
of
love
not
sure
the
midwest
is
ready
t
embrace
salty
sours
yet
but
we
could
do
much
worse
than
to
start
by
loving
this
one
o
a
pretty
delicious
flavorful
higherabv
gose
for
me
this
outshines
every
other
american
gose
ive
had
anderson
valley
westbrook
not
by
much
sour
note
the
list
goes
on
extremely
flavorful
tart
salty
very
much
a
gose
and
a
lot
less
like
what
most
microbreweries
are
doing
with
goses
blurring
the
lines
between
gose
and
berliner
keep
it
up
destihl
i
think
this
is
their
best
canned
release
yet
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
gose
i
was
really
surprised
how
much
this
beer
tastes
like
a
dill
pickle
which
is
slightly
weird
westbrook
gose
is
far
above
and
beyond
this
gose
dial
down
the
salt
and
coriander
let
the
lactobacillus
shine
through
and
you
will
have
an
outstanding
gose
overall
hell
yeah
this
is
one
heck
of
a
brew
bright
tartness
is
the
biggest
player
but
balanced
wheat
and
fruit
notes
are
perfectly
complimentary
good
for
you
destihl
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
ballpark
except
for
using
the
wrong
form
of
palate
in
the
description
on
the
can
but
hey
no
one
is
perfect
final
score
4
11
i
am
sorry
but
this
beer
doesnt
look
or
taste
like
a
gose
gose
is
a
style
which
was
initially
very
unique
to
me
so
it
will
take
me
a
while
to
appreciate
the
various
renditions
and
interpretations
but
this
one
is
very
approachable
and
a
good
thirst
quencher
golden
sunset
color
smell
is
lacking
slight
saltwater
odor
otherwise
smells
like
an
adjunct
lager
modest
floral
taste
finishes
with
salty
taste
slightly
sour
very
underrated
excellent
summer
brew
and
a
very
favorable
cost
ive
only
had
one
other
gose
so
i
cant
really
say
how
good
this
is
for
the
style
its
damned
enjoyable
though
normally
i
think
refreshing
is
a
rather
lazy
adjective
to
use
in
describing
a
beer
like
when
female
houseguests
mindlessly
refer
to
my
bedroom
as
kafkaesque
even
though
my
furnishings
evoke
none
of
the
subtle
humor
of
kafkas
work
this
beer
however
is
refreshing
as
hell
because
its
like
sitting
next
to
the
goddamn
ocean
pours
a
hazy
goldenamber
in
color
with
about
a
12
finger
white
head
that
settles
down
to
just
the
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
not
a
lot
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
wheat
and
spice
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
this
is
a
ale
brewed
with
coriander
and
salt
and
you
can
taste
both
of
those
ingredients
goes
down
easy
with
no
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
never
had
this
style
of
brew
but
i
like
it
lighter
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
a
good
brew
its
drinkable
it
doesnt
quite
have
that
zing
the
coriander
is
a
little
muted
as
well
with
that
said

like

was

a

my

i
am

if
my
palette
were
considerably

i
might
have

it
gose

not
my
favorite
beer
style
far
from
it
this
one
however
is
palatable
the
beer
poured
clear
with

white

that
is

the
scent
carries

notes
the

this
is

probably
the
best

drop
a

you
have
this

unique

im
not
a
big
sour
fan
to
begin
with

not

but
a

i
was

for

more

the

are

body

aroma

were
unusual
too
i
was
not
expecting
a
mild

the
gose
saltiness
was
there
but
the
main
flavor
was
a
mild
grapefruit
sourness
i
attribute
the
sweeter
floral
attributes
to
the
hibiscus
overall
not
bad
light
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
sour
tang
dont
know
if
i
would
call
this
a
gose
but
i
would
enjoy
a
few
in
the
summertime
surprisingly
pleased
with
this
one
its
not
a
very
typical
gose
but
has
all
the
characteristics
slightly
rearranged
and
then
augmented
by
soothing
hibiscus
pours
like
fizzy
pink
lemonade
aroma
is
grainy
lemony
and
lactic
with
sharp
acetic
notes
coriander
is
evident
but
the
hibiscus
is
very
subtle
flavor
is
puckeringly
sour
with
sharp
citric
acid
a
lactic
character
mid
palate
and
an
acetic
aftertaste
its
a
bit
difficult
to
pick
out
the
floral
notes
a
very
nice
sour
but
hibiscus
is
too
subtle
first
impression
is
the
orangerosy
hue
that
fills
the
glass
with
a
light
head
that
clears
out
quickly
the
first
punch
the
gose
packs
is
the
hibiscus
fruity
flavor
that
is
incredibly
smooth
once
that
taste
hits
your
palate
the
salt
taste
comes
right
behind
it
the
salt
taste
is
slightly
overbearing
breaking
up
the
overall
balance
of
the
gose
however
it
doesnt
completely
disrupt
the
hibiscus
aftertaste
that
finishes
the
sip
i
would
prefer
this
beer
in
the
summer
as
the
first
beer
of
the
day
i
cannot
say
i
would
pour
two
in
one
sitting
mostly
because
my
palate
doesnt
savor
fruitylike
tastes
drink
after
drink
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
come
next
summer
not
a
bad
offering
id
grab
it
again
as
a
light
sessionable
beer
ive
had
a
few
gose
now
and
this
one
is
middle
of
the
road
tartness
light
on
saltiness
reddish
amber
tinted
with
a
touch
of
pink
covered
with
an
initially
large
frothy
head
that
quickly
disintegrates
to
not
much
more
than
an
uneven
covering
smell
is
sour
and
mineral
in
nature
flowers
wheat
berries
and
a
general
earthy
funk
flavor
starts
with
a
flash
of
flowers
and
grass
before
becoming
more
berry
and
grapefruit
sweet
and
tart
finishing
with
brine
fresh
wheat
and
soft
spice
not
as
sour
as
some
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
mediumlight
slick
and
drying
which
keeps
it
very
drinkable
despite
the
mild
carbonation
well
done
oa
good
gose
that
just
needs
to
be
a
tad
more
tartsour
to
improve
the
beer
o
sour
salty
and
highly
drinkable
just
what
you
need
in
a
goes
not
the
best
goes
ive
had
but
pretty
close
clear

pour
with
a

is

a
great
take
on
the
style
but
nothing
really
like
traditional
goses
the
only
other
take
on
the
style
that
included
hibiscus
was
the
version
from
widmer
bros
and
it
wasnt
really
very
good
at
all
i
had
no
trouble
killing
a
six
pack
of
this
and
will
be
sad
to
see
it
goit
turned
out
to
be
a
really
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
nice
salty
crisp
flavor
golden
honey
color
nice
head
that
doesnt
remain
too
long
salty
orange
nose
solid
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
its
got
a
great
pink
color
to
it
really
bright
and
some
haze
to
the
beer
under
the
purest
white
head
an
aroma
less
of
hibiscus
and
more
of
tart
lactic
acid
and
coriander
hibiscus
is
easy
to
overdo
so
i
commend
it
for
its
delicacy
on
that
front
taste
too
i
find
this
being
neither
sour
or
salty
more
just
tart
and
full
bodied
and
mineral
based
in
the
finish
the
salt
adds
body
to
it
and
lengthens
the
finish
but
its
not
drying
on
the
palate
the
hibiscus
is
mild
and
plays
well
with
the
tartness
balancing
and
complimenting
one
another
what
i
like
most
is
the
carbonation
and
the
way
this
is
something
totally
different
its
expressive
with
the
bubbles
almost
hard
to
hold
on
the
tongue
so
fizzy
it
really
works
in
what
would
otherwise
seem
like
a
pretty
heavy
take
on
the
style
fun
stuff
im
glad
i
got
one
instead
of
six
though
its
not
as
tart
and
clean
as
i
like
my
gose
to
be
drinks
very
easy
they
should
do
this
a
summer
release
so
refreshing
floral
fruity
sour
patch
kids
candy
in
a
bottle
is
really
what
it
reminded
me
of
without
the
sugar
i
felt
it
tasted
less
refreshing
and
more
sour
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sours
then
this
would
be
a
cheap
alternative
if
you
are
interested
in
trying
this
style
of
beer
do
i
really
think
it
will
be
happening
in
the
future
at
least
i
hope
so
its
a
nice
late
summer
beer
complex
but
not
as
good
to
me
as
say
anderson
valley
i
would
love
to
check
out
westbrooks
version
o
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
but
would
have
been
great
if
it
came
out
in
the
beginning
of
the
summer
would
have
been
perfectly
refreshing
to
combat
the
real
heat
of
summer
rather
than
early
fall
football
season
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
reddish
pink
in
color
with
barely
a
trace
of
fingernail
thick
white
head
aroma
of
salt
and
herbal
hibiscus
flowers
is
very
unique
and
intense
the
taste
is
very
salty
with
some
coriander
in
the
front
of
the
palatebut
the
hibiscus
flower
does
a
nice
job
of
keeping
that
from
being
overwhelming
the
mouth
is
very
salty
and
carbonated
nice
pink
rose
color
huge
drinkability
salty
with
slight
floral
tones
o
an
approachable
beer
for
the
style
reminds
me
a
lot
of
hibiscus
syrup
added
to
a
tart
sparkling
wine
but
with
more
pronounced
sourness
and
salt
i
enjoy
this
even
if
i
favor
anderson
valleys
rendition
better
its
an
easy
sipper
and
tasty
enough
to
be
memorable

great

beer
dont
pass
it
up
if
you
can
find
it
its
at

worth
a
try
t
vinegar
tangy
strong
hibiscus
salty
aftertaste
is
sweeter
and
more
floral
with
notes
of
pepper
and
rosemary
a
great
combination
of
flavors
collide
in
a
light
spritzy
refreshing
beer
this
is
a
summer
sipper
to
say
the
salt
i
would
certainly
pick
this
up
again
in
the
future
sour
and
salty
cant
taste
the
flowers
they
just
turn
it
pink
on
a
hot
day
i
could
crush
these
forever
im

bottle
pours
a
pretty
pinkishorange
color
with
an
airy
bright
white
head
that
has
a
twinge
of
pink
to
it
the
head
slowly
fizzles
and
pops
away
leaving
not
much

aroma

slightly
tart
coriander
rose

the
flavor
reminds
me
of
pink
grapefruit
tart
and
slightly
briny
a
bit
of
unripe
berries
the
floral
notes
and
the
coriander
are
very
important
to
the
flavor
surprisingly
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
licking
the
lips
resurrects
the
saltiness
and
tartness
i
liked
this
beer
cant
wait
to
give
this
to
someone
and
explain
all
the
wacky
stuff
its
brewed
with
overall
one
of
the
more
consistent
goses
in
kansas
city
not
too
much
and
surprisingly
refreshing
its
not
a
labor
day
cookout
party
without
settlers
of
catan
and
a
gose
this
one
pours
a
mostly
clear
rose
or
perhaps
hibiscus
color
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
coriander
light
cracked
wheat
light
ruby
red
grapefruit
zest
and
a
hint
of
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
lemon
and
grapefruit
bringing
in
some
understandable
tartness
theres
a
vague
sense
of
salinity
but
nothing
firm
manifests
itself
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
brew
one
im
glad
my
local
beer
guy
convinced
me
to
buy
a
sixer
of
once
i
got
over
the
hibiscus
color
very
reddish
orange
and
tasted
the
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
good
amount
of
sour
reasonable
amount
of
salt
all
in
all
a
great
gose
overall
a
good
and
tasty
beer
but
not
quite
as
tart
and
missing
a
few
qualities
i
look
for
in
a
gose
certainly
a
good
drinkable
warm
weather
drink
surprisingly
good
attempt
at
a
difficult
style
pinkish
hue
with
no
lacing
tart
and
saltyfruity
aroma
fairly
complex
flavor
profile
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
average
gose
but
perhaps
that
is
intended
for
an
audience
that
may
not
have
tried
a
gose
before
at
any
rate
it
serves
as
an
accessible
introduction
to
the
style
and
offers
a
twist
on
a
classic
very
affordable
at
least
in
missouri
11
for
a
6
pk
o
overall
a
nice
mildly
sour
beer
i
prefer
that
its
less
salty
than
the
other
gose
id
tried
definitely
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
one
i
hope
they
start
releasing
annually
its
truly
one
of
the
unique
styles
of
beer
and
it
works
well
with
hibiscus
which
i
think
is
a
great
addition
to
lighter
style
beers
that
said
this
is
a
solid
beer
turns
out
i
love
hibiscus
who
knew
bottle
poured
into
tulip
glass
aroma
is
floral
sour
fruit
and
earthy
appearance
is
a
beautiful
reddish
color
taste
is
salty
up
front
opposite
of
other
goses
followed
by
some
tartness
and
finishes
earthy
and
salty
light
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
enjoyable
id
like
a
bit
more
tartness
but
still
really
good
taste
is
similarly
tart
with
a
fruity
floral
note
from
the
hibiscus
bright
crisp
and
dry
in
the
aftertaste
easily
drinkable
and
light
bodied
overall
a
great
summer
session
beer
that
shouldve
come
out

o
i
think
the
usage
of
hibiscus
is
very
smart
using
an
ingredient
like
that
brings
a
tea
like
quality
that
works
with
the
very
slight
tartness
not
as
salty
or
tart
as
others
of
the
style
much
more
restrained
take
executed
deftly
i
drank
about
a
case
of
this
this
summer
and
forgot
to
review
it
or
even
take
good
notes
what
a
dummy
the
perfect
style
of
beer
for
the
texas
summer
light
in
color
and
body
the
limes
are
apparent
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
the
salt
hits
about
middle
to
slightly
after
malt
is
very
unpronounced
and
shows
up
toward
the
finish
hard
to
tell
if
the
coriander
has
any
influence
as
the
lime
predominates
a
perfect
beach
drink
its
not
much
on
the
sour
end
of
things
unfortunately
those
hoping
for
something
as
tasty
as
westbrooks
offering
will
be
left
wanting
but
there
are
some
enjoyable
flavors
to
be
found
here
mostly
the
soft
wheat
salt
and
lime
the
coriander
i
could
do
without
in
this
beer
and
oddly
i
find
this
better
on
the
cooler
side
as
opposed
to
cellar
temp
good
enough
to
go
back
for
repeat
sixer
purchases
but
still
leaves
me
dreaming
of
having
westbrook
gose
in
a
picc
line
pours
out
a
hazy
brass
with
no
head
smells
largely
of
grain
and
lime
lime
and
salt
are
the
big
flavors
here
lightly
tart
and
a
bit
sweet
grainy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
flat
and
lightbodied
overall
this
is
ok
in
the
can
way
better
on
tap
but
im
rating
this
based
on
the
can
example
on
tap
it
seemed
to
be
drier
tarter
and
saltier
all
better
in
my
opinion
o
not
disappointed
but
probably
will
not
buy
again
due
to
my
slight
distaste
of
wheat
beers
o
definitely
different
from
the
other
gose
ive
tried
westbrook
i
think
i
like
westbrook
better
it
was
a
little
bit
more
tart
but
this
is
really
nice
got
this
as
a
single
planning
on
buying
a
sixer
next
time
i
hit
the
store
pours
medium
yellow
with
a
redish
tinge
soured
fruit
notes
with
no
hoppiness
in
the
nose
taste
is
wonderful
light
sour
with
a
bit
of
lime
and
spice
to
back
it
up
finished
pretty
dry
high
carbonation
which
is
a
bit
different
but
works
for
it
overall
a
great
saturday
afternoon
six
pack
o
interesting
take
on
the
gose
lets
call
it
a
texmex
version
of
the
german
style
given
that
it
has
a
heavy
lime
flavour
with
a
little
bit
of
cilantro
not
my
favorite
gose
as
its
not
as
tart
as
westbrooks
version
but
it
does
have
a
bit
more
in
common
with
leipzeigers
version
than
westbrooks
pours
a
cloudy
golden
beer
with
little
to
no
head
smells
like
lime
a
little
stale
taste
is
very
light
and
limey
like
a
mexican
lager
with
a
lime
in
it
the
lime
really
shines
through
definitely
not
in
the
background
body
is
very
light
and
clean
its
a
refreshing
pool
side
drinker
nothing
extremely
special
but
super
sessionable
and
great
for
outside
can
had
more
lime
flavor
and
a
bit
less
tartness
perfect
carbonation
on
the
cans
overall
a
great
summer
refresher
cloudy
straw
colored
pour
with
a
minimal

white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
medium

has

and
lime
fruity
with
a
citruslemonlime
flavor
that
has
nice
tart
edge
very
light
and
dry
beer
that
finishes
slightly
sour
certainly
not
a
brother
to
saint
arnold
boiler
room
but
a
close
cousin
both
are
great
examples
of
hard
to
make
unique
styles
highly
recommended
b
decided
to
try
one
of
the
beers
my
son
sent
me
from
texas
real
ale
18th
anniversary
gose
a
german
style
wheat
beer
with
coriander
lime
pours
nicely
with
a
full
head
and
a
scent
of
citrus
has
a
hazy
goldenlight
amber
tone
typical
of
wheat
beers
the
first
sip
reveals
a
strong
limey
flavor
with
a
slight
wheat
sweetness
i
can
barely
taste
the
coriander
as
the
lime
is
dominate
especially
on
the
sour
aftertaste
it
is
very
refreshing
i
am
not
a
big
gose
fan
but
i
am
learning
to
appreciate
the
style
more
and
more
real
ale
added
pureed
whole
lime
which
gave
their
gose
a
distinct
twist
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
gold
with
a
bubbly
white
head
the
aroma
had
distinct
lime
and
wheat
beer
qualities
but
was
overwhelmingly
lime
centered
the
taste
was
sharp
and
crisp
that
started
with
the
bready
wheat
and
hint
of
salt
but
quickly
spiked
to
a
tart
lime
that
faded
to
a
bready
lime
dry
finish
it
was
very
light
and
refreshing
which
made
a
perfect
summer
brew
in
texas
while
i
expected
more
salt
for
the
style
the
lime
definitely
dominated
and
accentuated
the
tart
characteristics
of
the
style
a
lime
gose
if
i
wanted
sprite
i
would
have
purchased
sprite
smells
mainly
like
coriander
seed
with
some
fresh
lime
juice
and
peel
and
a
yeasty
bready
note
fresh
and
attractive
both
the
coriander
and
lime
come
through
on
the
palate
too
with
the
coriander
again
being
the
more
prominent
of
the
two
light
dry
clean
refreshing
mild
salinity
only
a
hint
of
acidity
from
the
lime
i
cant
help
but
think
that
this
would
be
even
better
with
more
acidity
and
maybe
more
salt
but
in
any
case
its
quite
nice
refreshing
highly
drinkable
lots
of
lime
citrus
not
very
tart
overall
a
nice
quencher
for
texas
summer
and
smart
local
interpretation
the
salt
lime
and
wheat
base
find
a
good
harmony
rather
than
tasting
like
beer
spiked
with
a
margarita
cloudy
straw
colored
pour
with
a
minimal
head
white
head
that
fades
quickly
medium

hints
of
lemon
and
lime
fruity
with
a

flavor
that
has
nice
tart
edge
very
light
and
dry
beer
that
finishes
slightly
sour
the
briney
character
is
present
as
it
is
sipped
theres
more
salt
and
a
citric
squeeze
of
lime

i
love
this
brewery
someone
told
me
that
this
recently
medaled
at
the
world
beer
cup
or
something
but
i
have
yet
to
confirm
that
its
a
heck
of
a
nice
goes
no
matter
whether
it
won
something
or
not
it
should
have
honey
colored
not
as
pale
as
others
and
with
some
clarity
too
until
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
smallish
white
head
fades
fast
but
there
is
plenty
of
bubbles
in
the
beer
nose
is
nice
and
tart
lactic
acidity
is
mid
range
nothing
caustic
but
nice
and
zippy
too
coriander
is
on
the
lighter
side
in
both
smell
and
taste
which
is
great
sometimes
these
get
too
foody
and
herbal
more
mealish
than
beerish
this
one
stays
light
despite
a
richer
color
and
a
little
more
body
than
the
style
average
in
my
experience
salt
is
there
actually
having
a
strange
and
paradoxical
effect
of
making
my
mouth
water
after
the
swallow
and
with
the
nice
refreshing
carbonation
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
for
a
warm
afternoon
wheat
malt
is
fresh
and
crockery
light
citrus
with
the
sourness
lemon
rind
or
grapefruit
flesh
or
something
like
that
when
ice
cold
its
perfect
but
when
it
warms
up
and
the
pour
gets
dreggy
its
not
as
flattering
definitely
worth
seeking
out
this
poured
out
as
a
hazy
golden
color
with
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
faded
quickly
there
is
not
lacing
or
retention
i
this
red
lively
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
the
beer
the
second
pour
give
a
good
amount
of
sediment
making
this
a
milky
looking
tan
color
the
smell
is
slightly
tart
with
some
wheat
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
tart
with
some
lemon
citrus
the
salty
wheat
comes
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
has
a
big
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
really
enjoyable
thanks
blueokie
for
the
opportunity
the
beer
pours
a
coffee
w
creamer
hazy
light
brown
with
with
no
head
the
nose
is
slightly
tart
with
a
bit
of
funk
the
taste
is
acidic
and
fruityyeasty
and
a
bit
of
salt
honestly
this
beer
drinks
easy
despite
the
tart
funk
but
finishes
like
i
was
chewing
on
a
piece
of
cardboard
this
beer
is
interesting
mouthfeel
but
finishes
piss
poorly
ive
had
a
better
gose
but
none
that
was
this
milkycloudy
they
created
a
beer
that
was
almost
lost
maybe
there
was
a
reason
for
it
not
being
popular
absolutely
worth
finding
and
trying
though
o
a
pretty
average
gose
but
not
as
refreshing
as
some
goses
i
have
had
but
i
found
it
better
than
uprights
gose
the
chlorine
element
is
the
major
defect
but
it
did
not
kill
the
beer
overall
tasty
but
i
prefer
the
cascade
variant
we
tasted
earlier
in
the
evening
the
pour
yields
a
medium
golden
brew
with
a
nice
fizzy
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
a
good
dosing
of
coriander
and
citrus
with
a
bit
of
salt
in
the
background
the
flavor
adds
quite
a
bit
of
salt
though
doesnt
take
it
over
the
top
nice
coriander
and
spice
plus
some
orange
peel
light
crisp
body
with
a
faint
acidity
nicely
done
o
a
very
interesting
beer
with
crisp
clean
taste
and
a
perfect
palate
cleanser
slightly
on
the
salt
side
but
mostly
sour
yet
refreshing
variety
that
will
be
enjoyed
often
do
this
beer
takes
sourness
to
a
new
extreme
for
the
style
but
remains
true
to
the
clean
and
refreshing
aspects
at
the
same
time
it
has
a
less
pronounced
dehydrating
effect
than
some
others
suggesting
a
less
aggressive
salt
addition
krebschoc
shows
itself
to
be
an
adventurous
small
brewery
in
the
stylistic
choices
they
make
as
in
the
case
of
this
beer
even
if
the
results
arent
always
entirely
convincing
overall
a
very
interesting
and
unusual
brew
no
off
flavor
whatsoever
a
very
nice
beer
for
the
summer
very
drinkable
would
be
very
thirst
quenching
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
fun
strange
style
this
is
definitely
a
zesty
tangy
beer
but
the
subtle
caramel
malt
gives
it
a
nice
balancing
sweetness
along
with
the
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
more
body
would
make
this
offering
stellar
but
if
you
enjoy
the
style
and
the
pucker
it
is
quite
a
refreshing
drink
this
beer
is
nuts
ive
never
had
a
gose
before
and
this
is
certainly
an
experience
not
sure
if
ill
go
searching
this
style
out
but
it
was
highly
memorable
d
i
cant
stand
wasabi
or
horseradish
so
the
aroma
really
didnt
work
for
me
however
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
quite
enjoyable
its
very
salty
and
spicy
compared
to
other
goses
ive
had
which
makes
it
a
bit
of
struggle
to
drink
in
large
quantities
beer
is
light
in
body
and
very
salty
nice
overall
very
enjoyable
heavily
carbonated
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
nice
too
not
dry
the
lacto
character
in
this
beer
is
subdued
but
it
is
nice
i
enjoyed
it
a
nicer
gose
than
most
ive
had
i
would
have
it
again
more
lactic
creaminess
would
make
this
beer
better
the
beer
is
transparent
and
light
orange
colored
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
the
aroma
offers
white
grape
juice
grape
skins
white
wine
spice
the
flavor
resembles
ocean
water
salty
and
earthy
lingering
sea
salt
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
a
puckering
sensation
in
the
cheeks
very
bold
flavor
definitely
recognizable
as
a
gose
right
off
the
bat
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
taste
is
damn
spot
on
slight
salt
which
balances
the
tart
sour
this
is
the
best
gose
i
have
had
not
too
much
going
on
i
the
way
of
complexity
but
man
this
is
amazing
spot
on
congrats
choc
best
beer
to
style
you
have
made
absolutely
amazing
pours
a
darker
orange
than
most
of
the
goses
not
much
head
looks
pretty
so
so
compared
to
the
rest
smells
spicy
and
tart
there
is
almost
some
chili
pepper
the
taste
is
sweet
and
very
tart
coriander
is
strong
lot
of
lemon
zest
under
carbonated
compared
to
the
rest
overall
my
least
favourite
other
than
the
salt
of
the
earth
which
suuuucked
o
not
too
bad
want
more
salt
and
less
tart
not
my
most
favorite
style
but
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
thats
right
a
new
gose
and
from
the
sooner
state
no
less
right
on
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
golden
straw
pretty
much
yellow
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
seemed
more
like
that
of
a
white
wine
than
a
beer
mike
and
i
agreed
that
a
spicy
chardonnay
or
moscato
fit
the
bill
pretty
nicely
basically
its
all
just
spicy
white
grapes
with
a
hint
of
coriander
balsa
and
tart
lemon
zest
cowering
in
the
distance
the
taste
returns
to
the
usual
gose
territory
with
notes
of
tart
lemon
light
tart
orange
zest
coriander
cracked
wheat
light
cardamom
and
a
twist
of
tart
grapefruit
not
very
much
of
a
salty
character
here
which
ive
gotten
in
the
other
goses
ive
sampled
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
almost
sticky
finish
overall
a
highly
enjoyable
brew
not
too
sour
but
something
easily
drinkable
in
large
amounts
if
so
desired
good
times
overall
a
bit
more
tart
that
i
expected
the
spice
flavor
was
intense
but
good
i
would
consider
having
another
since
this
is
the
first
gose
ive
tried
i
really
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
it
seems
to
be
in
line
with
the
style
guide
ive
decided
not
to
throw
the
towel
in
on
this
beer
but
i
think
the
bottling
in
a
magnum
demands
sharing
with
friends
while
this
one
kicked
my
butt
a
bit
i
will
seek
out
a
few
more
for
comparisons
sake
dirty
apricot
with
a
two
finger
disc
of
white
head
that
comes
just
to
the
lip
of
the
tulip
earthy
wheat
sets
a
mild
backdrop
for
the
lemon
juice
and
peel
mixed
with
ruddy
seawater
flavor
profile
distinct
yet
multidimensional
and
wellintegrated
lactic
tartness
drives
the
beer
and
further
accents
the
citrus
from
the
coriander
intriguing
but
so
refreshing
and
easy
to
gulp
that
its
hard
to
make
the
bottle
last
long
enough
to
contemplate
it
the
rustic
graininess
comes
out
further
once
it
warms
choc
has
done
a
nice
job
with
this
one
and
ill
be
picking
up
one
or
two
more
bottles
while
its
still
around
o
this
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
unlike
any
i
have
tasted
the
beginning
is
pretty
standard
for
a
farmhouse
ale
but
the
salty
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
the
maltiness
in
the
finish
is
more
indicative
of
a
pilsner
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
brew
that
you
should
try
if
you
get
the
chance
o
ive
never
tried
any
other
goses
to
compare
this
to
but
this
has
a
very
lasting
impressing
great
job
choc
super
drinkability
couldnt
stay
on
it
all
day
but
man
this
really
slakes
the
thirst
this
is
a
pretty
daring
take
on
the
style
works
for
me
im
very
impressed
by
this
one
d
this
is
my
first
gose
but
it
will
not
be
my
last
a
fantastic
offering
from
choc
this
really
is
one
of
the
most
impressive
signature
offerings
cannot
wait
to
see
more
seek
out
a
good
balance
of
spice
tart
sour
and
saltiness
the
earthy
wheat
backs
everything
up
very
interesting
will
definitely
be
picking
more
bottles
of
this
a
pleasantly
tart
sour
and
wheaty
beer
decent
session
beer
that
pairs
well
with
curry
intriguing
beer
purchased
in
ma
as
imported
from
the
former
ddr
now
germany
well
worth
a
try
would
probably
fit
in
as
a
thirst
quencher
in
the
summer
pours
an
opaque
deep
straw
producing
barely
1
5
fingers
of
shortlived
foamy
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
has
a
low
but
nice
wheat
profile
i
detect
what
i
would
call
pilsner
malts
it
is
crisp
clean
dry
with
hints
of
tart
fruit
brine
which
the
brewery
says
should
be
be
below
what
humans
can
distinguish
as
salt
taste
opens
with
lactic
acid
sourness
wheat
a
hint
of
coriander
finishes
peppery
clean
crisp
dry
with
faint
salinity
again
tart
fruit
aftertaste
is
salty
wheat
coriander
with
briney
lemon
lime
tart
green
apple
easier
to
drink
than
the
american
versions
i
have
tried
due
to
less
lactic
acid
sourness
salt
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
that
rapidly
dissipates
as
the
brew
warms
lightly
astringent
prickly
dry
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
lively
looking
carbonation
small
head
and
minimal
lace
aroma
first
hits
you
with
salty
tones
but
becomes
more
malty
as
it
warms
i
dug
the
taste
not
too
salty
or
sour
hint
of
lemon
and
enough
of
a
malty
backbone
to
make
it
drinkable
good
feel
light
and
refreshing
great
for
a
hot
day
the
first
time
i
tried
gose
i
poured
it
down
the
drain
this
one
my
2nd
one
i
liked
either
it
is
becoming
an
acquired
taste
or
i
simply
like
this
one
better
overall
really
enjoyed
this
makes
me
want
to
try
more
of
the
style
five
bucks
per
bottle
is
a
little
steep
but
id
surely
have
it
again
tasty
gose
good
example
of
the
style
overall
i
was
interested
in
trying
this
one
i
am
thankful
i
just
bought
the
one
it
does
not
have
a
date
on
the
bottle
so
i
have
no
idea
how
old
it
is
but
i
doubt
the
store
i
purchased
it
from
would
allow
it
to
stay
very
long
considering
its
a
low
abv
beer
would
i
buy
this
again
probably
not
considering
there
are
others
that
are
much
better
to
me
anyway
pretty
boring
beer
for
the
price
light
refreshing
citrusy
not
too
much
salt
or
sourness
westbrook
gose
this
is
not
much
more
traditional
overall
its
a
great
beer
i
wasnt
getting
a
whole
lot
of
wheat
flavor
our
sourness
from
the
beer
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
its
a
nice
light
drink
that
could
be
enjoyed
with
about
anything
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
hasnt
tried
a
gose
and
those
who
have
who
enjoy
coriander
spiced
witbiers
i
would
buy
it
again
im
a
fan
not
to
many
true
german
goses
available
and
this
seems
to
fit
the
bill
from
the
handful
of
others
i
have
had
it
is
soft
and
subtle
but
really
enjoyable
o
very
interesting
flavors
come
together
here
very
delicious
pours
out
a
hazy
gold
white
head
smells
of
crackery
wheat
and
bright
coriander
taste
is
crisp
acidic
citric
with
fruitiness
from
the
coriander
salt
is
very
delicate
much
more
subtle
than
us
versions
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
mild
prickling
carbonation
awesome
beer
wish
this
were
in
6
packs
light
refreshing
slightly
sour
witg
a
nice
malty
finish
pretty
nice
i
think
it
just
got
distribution
in
texas
hopefully
its
just
as
delicious
in
bottle
form
when
i
get
back
o
a
classic
brew
ive
been
drinking
westbrooks
version
of
this
which
is
much
more
sour
this
is
really
good
and
presumably
more
traditional
being
from
germany
and
done
to
style
unique
balanced
fruity
salty
and
sour
its
nice
on
a
warm
night
at
table
rock
lake
mo
drank
aug
6th
2014
of
all
the
readily
available
examples
of
gose
where
i
live
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
have
had
better
ones
while
in
germany
but
i
cannot
seem
to
find
those
here
this
is
a
very
typical
gose
and
thus
a
good
starter
for
those
unfamiliar
with
this
complex
and
challenging
style
it
may
just
be
me
but
i
feel
that
the
american
wild
ale
substyle
has
as
much
if
not
more
in
common
with
a
german
gose
and
berliner
weiss
for
that
matter
as
it
does
with
flemish
style
red
and
brown
sours
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
given
the
choice
i
would
probably
choose
a
westbrook
gose
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
the
murky
appearance
and
lumps
are
somewhat
offputting
but
the
salty
refreshingness
is
well
worth
it
close
your
eyes
overall
pretty
disappointed
in
this
one
an
odd
aroma
and
weak
flavor
profile
make
this
one
i
wont
likely
revisit
maybe
this
was
a
badold
bottle
but
without
knowing
for
sure
id
have
to
recommend
avoiding
this
one
tasty
but
i
was
a
bit
thrown
off
by
the
milk
and
butter
hints
i
was
getting
for
me
it
stopped
it
from
being
great
still
i
found
it
good
overall
fantastic
beer
a
style
that
i
usually
get
when
i
find
it
because
it
is
so
hard
to
find
enjoyed
it
immensely
this
is
an
excellent
specialty
beer
from
the
saxon
area
of
germany
it
pours
burnt
orange
cloudy
medium
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
there
is
decent
carbonation
and
some
lacings
it
has
myriad
of
taste
that
comingle
in
the
mouth
these
include
lactic
floral
grains
fruits
and
wheat
it
has
no
bite
or
edge
foes
down
easy
but
is
pretty
filling
picked
this
up
at
the
fridge
in
lancaster
pa
split
it
with
me
beer
guru
great
beer
not
as
good
as
lost
nation
but
very
good
so
easy
to
drink
and
had
me
hurrying
to
the
next
drink
the
only
complaint
would
be
the
smell
which
i
did
not
enjoy
really
hope
that
i
can
find
this
again
presented
in
a
tulip
with
a
hazy
gold
color
and
2
fingers
of
white
head
that
retained
well
smelling
it
i
got
a
big
clean
springtime
flower
garden
scent
with
sweet
lemon
candy
rock
salt
and
white
pepper
it
has
a
light
wheat
taste
with
a
pop
of
tanginess
and
rose
petal
up
front
theres
a
good
evolution
in
the
mouth
the
saltiness
shows
up
but
is
kept
in
check
then
it
finishes
sour
feels
light
but
silky
and
effervescent
in
the
mouth
o
this
is
the
first
beer
i
have
tried
in
this
style
and
i
find
it
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
cant
wait
to
have
more
first
gose
for
me
expected
more
coriander
appearance
looked
like
a
standard
lager
but
very
little
head
no
lace
decent
golden
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
action
as
mentioned
didnt
pick
up
any
coriander
in
the
aroma
and
taste
the
salt
was
not
noticeable
in
the
flavor
but
found
in
the
aftertaste
similar
to
the
saltflavoraftertaste
you
get
after
sipping
a
margarita
the
mouthfeel
was
originally
very
lively
but
i
didnt
pound
the
beer
and
after
sitting
10
min
or
so
it
quickly
came
across
almost
flat
it
was
refreshing
at
first
then
became
more
interesting
than
sessionable
i
dont
have
any
other
gose
reference
so
i
attempted
to
be
fair
in
evaluating
overall
ive
not
had
many
of
the
gose
stylethis
would
be
my
fourth
ever
and
the
first
that
is
from
the
country
where
the
style
originated
ive
read
that
the
style
in
germany
can
be
extremely
sour
almost
like
a
gueuze
and
this
one
was
certainly
not
that
but
i
definitely
appreciate
the
subtle
complexity
that
is
going
on
here
im
of
the
opinion
that
this
is
the
best
in
style
from
a
style
that
ive
admittedly
had
limited
exposure
to
i
can
see
myself
buying
bottles
of
this
in
the
future
to
have
in
the
summer
first
time
trying
this
style
and
i
like
it
different
and
definitely
something
that
would
be
thirst
quenching
come
summertime
o
a
refreshing
pour
that
i
would
enjoy
during
warmer
months
pricey
but
worth
it
over
any
of
the
others
similar
glad
for
the
recommendation
of
a
fellow
customer
the
beer
pours
a
relatively
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
thin
halo
of
white
head
around
the
perimeter
the
nose
is
definitely
light
and
sweet
spice
forward
with
a
touch
of
saline
and
funk
lingering
in
the
background
accented
when
warmed
a
dull
coriander
is
present
in
the
taste
but
its
more
difficult
to
detect
comparatively
there
is
definitely
more
grain
sweetness
as
well
however
no
flavor
is
particularly
overpowering
and
all
blend
nicely
the
beers
mouthfeel
is
slightly
tart
semisweet
spicy
light
bodied
and
effervescent
with
minimal
funk
or
booze
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
gose
but
out
of
my
price
range
for
a
repeat
looks
light
golden
with
a
soft
head
the
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
hints
of
spices
like
coriander
of
course
tastes
both
sour
and
salty
with
clear
citrus
aroma
a
light
body
with
soft
carbonation
makes
it
very
drinkable
unfortunately
this
gose
has
almost
no
aftertaste
o
nothing
like
im
used
to
in
the
regards
to
gose
westbrook
has
perfected
it
in
my
opinion
this
wasnt
bad
but
not
great
compared
to
what
ive
had
this
could
have
been
a
bit
old
as
it
was
sitting
in
the
cooler
at
my
local
haunt
for
several
months
may
revisit
this
with
a
fresh
bottle
o
i
have
not
had
alot
of
experience
with
gose
yet
but
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
one
i
am
really
surprised
this
does
not
have
a
higher
rating
on
this
site
it
is
beautifully
balanced
and
thrist
quenchingly
crisp
the
perfect
summertime
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
quite
a
refreshing
and
tasty
brew
sweet
up
front
followed
with
some
spice
and
a
tart
end
i
really
liked
it
not
a
mindblowing
beer
my
first
gose
id
imagine
its
a
good
beginner
its
lightbodied
and
refreshing
lightly
crisp
and
almost
fluffy
this
was
my
first
gose
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
but
if
this
is
what
they
are
supposed
to
taste
like
all
i
can
say
is
that
its
very
interesting
and
very
different
from
any
other
style
of
beer
ive
tried
but
it
wont
be
a
favorite
style
of
mine
eric
overall
this
is
very
unique
and
enjoyable
definitely
recommended
overall
not
bad
i
think
its
lost
something
from
when
it
was
in
germany
as
most
of
the
beers
ive
had
here
and
while
in
germany
its
decent
but
i
want
to
try
it
super
fresh
sometime
seems
like
its
not
quite
the
same
beer
it
should
be
this
is
my
first
gose
and
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
moment
for
some
time
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
at
all
if
this
style
would
be
more
often
available
i
would
say
goodbye
to
often
disappointing
witbier
as
a
summer
treat
thank
you
in
de
wilde
man
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
in
leipzig
it
was
awesome
definately
something
different
a
great
regional
specialty
having
a
tough
time
finding
it
in
the
us
well
worth
a
taste
if
you
havent
tried
it
before
taste
was
awesome
very
refreshing
bought
a
large
bottle
at
the
brewery
excellent
bottled
as
well
330
ml
bottle
pours
hazygolden
with
tall
long
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
of
wheat
malt
spices
and
some
hops
body
is
full
and
smooth
wheat
malt
salt
spices
funky
yeast
some
sourness
and
tartness
combine
on
the
palate
finish
is
long
salty
and
tart
nice
refreshing
brew
o
an
excellent
refreshing
beer
and
my
first
review
of
this
style
taste
of
crackery
grain
along
with
a
dose
of
lemon
and
honey
saltiness
reveals
itself
a
bit
on
the
close
yet
more
so
as
a
lingering
aftertaste
which
interplays
with
or
gets
confused
with
the
lactic
factor
slightly
sweet
on
the
finish
yet
not
overly
so
by
any
means
feel
is
light
and
slightly
salty
with
a
light
carbonation
overall
a
pleasant
experience
yet
not
one
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
slightly
sour
slightly
sweet
slightly
salty
and
slightly
bitter
in
that
sense
it
covers
it
all
more
thanks
go
to
cameron
thebishopco
for
providing
this
from
my
want
list
this
is
my
second
gose
beer
experience
and
i
have
to
start
by
saying
this
is
the
far
better
of
the
two
being
an
authentic
german
brew
leipziger
gose
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
very
fizzy
1
sized
head
i
am
not
finding
lace
on
the
glass
once
drank
however
the
aroma
is
similar
to
a
european
pils
style
but
a
bit
grainier
with
the
coriander
and
citrus
scents
noticeable
as
well
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
but
more
fullflavored
than
one
might
expect
whats
nice
is
that
theres
a
bit
of
yeasty
funk
and
sour
apple
hints
in
the
mix
the
salt
a
signature
of
the
style
is
present
but
very
subtle
almost
giving
it
a
seltzer
like
mouth
feel
this
light
beer
finishes
with
an
extremely
crisp
bitterness
overall
my
recommendation
mirrors
my
overall
methods
of
trying
a
new
style
try
the
original
imports
first
before
the
local
attempts
while
a
refreshing
beer
and
quite
sessionable
it
falls
a
bit
short
of
a
summer
quencher
o
really
easy
drinking
beer
well
made
i
like
the
balance
and
slight
sourness
not
overwhelmingly
flavorful
but
this
is
the
right
beer
in
certain
circumstances
namely
in
warmer
weather
paired
with
some
nice
cheeses
this
beer
kind
of
grows
on
you
but
its
saltiness
is
just
a
little
too
much
interesting
to
say
the
least
glad
i
tried
it
but
a
little
too
odd
for
my
liking
a
little
less
orange
juicy
a
little
less
salty
and
it
might
be
a
solid
beer
but
who
knows
maybe
ill
grow
to
like
this
like
sours
o
for
the
first
real
example
of
the
style
it
makes
me
intrigued
with
what
else
is
part
of
this
tasty
salty
and
so
very
tight
in
feel
definitely
a
different
tasting
beer
and
probably
the
first
gose
beer
ive
had
sour
and
citric
taste
lemon
and
lime
that
has
a
mild
soapy
aftertaste
not
unpleasant
per
se
but
different
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
smoother
hefeweizen
but
with
a
definite
coriander
or
cilantro
character
ill
definitely
explore
some
more
offerings
in
this
style
even
if
it
wouldnt
be
near
the
top
of
my
list
in
beer
styles
o
kind
of
a
boring
style
overall
but
i
see
why
it
has
caught
on
its
definitely
for
those
who
are
turned
off
by
the
belgian
funk
yet
still
was
somewhat
of
that
taste
profile
o
all
in
all
this
is
very
good
refreshing
as
hell
it
comes
across
as
a
hefeweizen
with
spicing
and
a
pronounced
citric
or
is
it
lactic
acidity
the
yeast
profile
has
a
familiarity
to
it
bottle
poured
a
hazy
hay
color
gose
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
seas
alt
with
coriander
is
really
nice
with
light
lemony
notes
also
discernable
taste
is
a
very
good
balanced
mix
between
a
solid
malt
backbone
with
great
notes
of
sea
salt
and
lemony
finish
with
light
brett
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
well
balanced
gose
and
kind
of
what
i
had
in
mind
for
the
style
even
thought
i
dont
often
have
the
chance
to
taste
it
this
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
from
yeast
constantly
causing
carbon
to
rise
to
the
top
the
aroma
has
yeast
to
it
giving
it
that
freshly
baked
bread
scent
with
coriander
in
the
mix
the
texture
is
uniquely
thin
as
i
suspect
from
all
the
carbonation
with
lots
of
spices
in
the
taste
making
this
an
easy
light
drinking
beer
with
an
overall
citrusy
quality
this
is
certainly
a
different
style
of
beer
making
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
fans
of
saison
and
wit
styles
would
love
this
beer
very
interesting
i
would
definitely
try
more
in
the
style
o
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
goses
but
this
was
a
really
tasty
interesting
beer
id
happily
drink
this
more
regularly
overall
i
have
been
seeking
this
beer
out
for
awhile
but
was
a
little
underwhelmed
it
is
slightly
different
from
a
typical
wheat
beer
but
not
too
much
so
worth
trying
as
it
is
a
unique
style
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
an
interesting
article
pours
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
lazy
white
head
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
malt
and
the
corriander
seed
is
more
prominent
than
the
salt
almost
herbal
or
indian
rather
than
german
flavor
is
good
salt
is
much
less
than
the
other
gose
versions
ive
had
just
subtle
in
the
finish
the
corriander
and
the
wheat
are
the
most
dominant
flavors
its
spicy
and
yeasty
and
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
dont
love
it
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
body
and
perhaps
even
some
more
hops
an
american
gose
all
hoppy
and
salty
might
be
an
interesting
beer
who
knows
for
now
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
affordable
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
nice
the
fruit
flavours
go
well
the
flavor
is
light
with
a
faint
sourness
again
there
is
that
citrus
similar
to
the
aroma
tart
pleasing
beer
berry
refreshing
taste
and
easily
enjoyed
during
the
summer
months
the
finish
is
clean
with
no
real
after
taste
highly
recommendable
beer
ive
only
had
a
couple
examples
of
gose
and
this
one
seems
decent
and
consistent
by
no
means
would
i
pay
for
it
again
but
the
bottle
is
totally
worth
the
novelty
value
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bubbly
yellow
with
12
inch
head
and
no
lace
the
aroma
is
lemony
with
some
wheat
and
hay
the
flavor
is
mainly
white
grapes
with
very
mild
sweet
malt
and
mile
hoppiness
it
becomes
more
champagnelike
as
it
warms
its
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
and
slightly
dry
gasthaus
leipziger
gose
is
a
good
beer
similar
but
not
as
tart
as
champagne
recommended
this
was
an
interesting
experience
i
feel
that
this
will
make
me
better
in
my
beer
reviews
i
recommend
this
to
grow
your
pallatte
and
beer
understanding
this
beer
that
is
brewed
in
germany
has
an
appearance
that
is
light
yellowishorange
there
is
a
bit
of
carbonation
which
results
in
a
fine
head
while
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
there
are
hints
of
coriander
and
lemom
a
light
easy
drinking
beer
its
something
different
overall
a
very
interesting
drink
not
bad
at
all
like
a
witbier
and
berliner
weisse
blend
o
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
the
flavors
arent
bad
its
just
not
my
thing
its
is
drinkable
and
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
i
really
wont
buy
it
again
appearance
is
light
orange
with
a
short
white
head
this
beer
that
i
had
been
meaning
to
try
for
some
time
has
a
smell
of
straw
grain
lemon
and
green
apples
upon
sipping
this
gose
i
taste
salt
wheat
acid
citrus
with
tartness
mouthfeel
is
easy
going
a
proper
carbonation
for
the
style
it
really
is
a
great
quaffer
for
a
warm
day
albeit
one
that
may
cause
you
to
pucker
your
lips
poured
into
a
uerige
stange
pours
a
light
yelloworange
amber
fine
white
two
finger
head
and
active
carbonation
resultiing
in
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
faint
sweet
malt
coriander
strong
mineral
component
slightly
sour
flavor
also
has
a
dry
mineral
component
melded
with
light
wheat
a
hint
of
malt
slightly
acidic
lemon
finishes
dry
with
a
suggestion
of
coriander
and
salt
somewhat
sour
all
flavors
are
light
but
surprising
amount
of
complexity
for
the
low
key
taste
components
very
light
bodied
but
nice
carbonation
a
very
interesting
uncommon
beer
style
that
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
o
this
beer
really
gets
my
goat
the
bottle
broke
when
i
opened
it
leaving
me
worried
i
might
be
drinking
some
glass
and
the
beer
itself
was
totally
uncarbonated
leaving
a
sort
of
gross
drying
mouth
to
it
the
salt
levels
kept
me
interested
and
the
flavor
was
unique
but
im
mad
i
paid
for
this
this
was
my
first
dabble
with
this
style
and
it
was
uncarbonated
and
potentially
glass
filled
overall
my
first
gose
nice
thirst
quenching
a
pretty
average
gose
thinnish
body
with
good
carbonation
crisp
dry
clean
and
refreshing
not
super
exciting
or
flavorful
but
a
nice
accompaniment
to
pizza
to
be
sure
would
love
to
try
more
examples
of
this
style
but
they
are
sadly
quite
difficult
to
find
this
one
was
certainly
nothing
earthshattering
enjoyable
yes
but
not
as
interesting
as
a
good
berliner
weiss
nice
pale
yellow
shade
with
big
fluffy
white
pillow
as
a
head
laces
down
nicely
but
the
head
doesnt
stay
as
impressive
as
long
as
it
might
hazy
but
not
in
a
bad
way
im
pretty
sure
this
is
what
this
beer
is
supposed
to
look
like
definitely
didnt
turn
me
off
with
its
looks
by
any
means
some
great
smells
on
it
lemony
citrus
probably
the
coriander
a
bit
of
bread
some
malt
and
yeast
good
mix
of
smells
that
seem
totally
appropriate
for
the
beers
appearance
up
until
the
taste
point
this
could
be
a
couple
different
kinds
of
beers
but
wow
very
unique
flavor
citric
tart
and
yes
salty
i
dont
think
youre
supposed
to
taste
the
salt
in
these
but
there
just
is
no
missing
it
feels
very
full
on
the
mouth
stays
lively
with
carbonation
though
overall
and
absolute
delight
to
drink
as
it
stands
i
would
only
really
want
one
but
on
the
other
hand
i
think
i
could
totally
get
used
to
it
if
it
was
the
beer
that
was
all
around
my
town
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
to
try
this
beer
and
you
havent
had
it
i
would
highly
recommend
availing
yourself
of
the
experience
would
like
to
try
straight
from
the
source
as
it
stands
though
this
is
a
wonderful
treat
and
a
style
i
hope
to
have
more
of
sooner
rather
then
later
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
very
interesting
and
pretty
good
tasting
beer
i
thought
the
saltiness
added
a
interesting
and
somewhat
refreshing
component
to
it
the
citrus
flavors
worked
well
for
it
as
well
i
liked
it
this
is
one
easy
drinking
beer
it
begs
to
be
drank
quickly
the
way
it
finishes
on
the
palate
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
to
session
on
the
rest
of
the
night
o
a
good
change
of
pace
bier
something
i
couldnt
drink
really
often
but
pretty
nice
this
is
my
first
gose
and
it
has
a
very
interesting
smell
right
off
the
bat
its
like
seriously
salty
tortilla
chips
then
wheat
and
citrus
color
is
bright
yelloworange
and
completely
hazy
flavor
has
a
bit
of
salt
and
the
back
end
and
mostly
wheat
crackers
up
front
quite
the
interesting
beer
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
tart
at
all
citrus
yes
but
not
tart
in
the
least
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
aroma
of
light
sweet
fruity
esters
some
light
grassy
notes
taste
is
a
sweet
and
salted
sourness
some
yeast
with
some
light
fruity
notes
palate
is
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
finish
is
a
sweet
salted
sourness
with
some
yeast
and
light
fruity
notes
taste
like
it
was
fermented
on
a
bed
of
sea
salt
surprisingly
i
was
able
to
finish
drinking
this
brew
as
the
flavor
grows
on
you
overall
an
ok
and
interesting
brew
o
very
refreshing
and
something
that
would
be
wonderful
on
that
first
warm
day
of
spring
enjoyed
outside
i
really
enjoyed
the
beer
and
would
love
to
see
more
offerings
available
in
this
style
o
this
wasnt
bad
but
now
i
know
why
this
isnt
a
more
popular
style
a
very
refreshing
beer
makes
for
a
welcome
alternate
to
the
easy
session
beers
of
summer
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
i
wouldnt
exactly
say
i
like
it
but
i
imagine
this
is
what
a
gose
is
supposed
to
be
like
i
also
imagine
this
is
perhaps
why
goses
are
no
longer
in
vogue
worth
trying
but
i
doubt
ill
seek
it
out
in
the
future
overall
quite
a
refreshing
drink
bordering
on
apricot
soda
and
malt
refreshment
quite
nice
dr
i
dont
really
know
the
style
well
this
is
me
first
beer
in
the
style
but
the
emphasis
seems
to
be
on
adequate
presentation
of
the
sourness
belgian
sours
sure
do
this
better
and
this
feels
simple
in
comparison
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers
in
the
style
its
low
abv
never
shows
not
that
youd
expect
it
to
overall
interesting
and
different
difficult
to
describe
but
it
ended
up
being
ok
my
first
chance
to
sample
this
style
and
i
was
interested
to
see
how
the
use
of
salt
would
work
the
salt
was
reserved
adding
more
of
a
sharp
tangyness
than
actual
salinity
moderately
tart
with
some
coriander
in
the
background
mouthfeel
was
lean
and
wheaty
i
can
see
this
as
an
excellent
hotweather
quencher
this
has
to
be
the
blandest
of
hazy
yellows
i
have
ever
seen
a
small
white
head
sits
on
top
decent
retention
no
lacing
the
nose
is
a
little
barny
otherwise
does
not
have
too
much
going
on
the
palate
is
a
tartplosion
to
begin
followed
by
a
blast
of
salt
and
finishes
with
a
solid
chewy
wheat
body
the
tart
salt
and
light
body
makes
this
highly
quaffable
the
lacto
is
delicious
and
easy
drinking
finish
is
tart
and
dry
overall
a
refreshing
beer
that
loaded
up
on
the
crockery
grain
qualities
and
subtly
spiced
will
be
looking
to
try
other
versions
of
this
style
well
the
mystery
is
whether
this
is
a
better
than
average
gose
im
definitely
on
the
lookout
for
some
domestic
versions
of
this
wild
style
pours
a
fairly
clear
yellow
colour
lots
of
white
head
smells
spicy
and
a
touch
yeasty
i
think
i
can
actually
detect
the
coriander
on
the
nose
tastes
yeasty
and
spicy
i
thi
this
is
more
interesting
than
the
ccb
gose
but
there
is
a
light
fruity
characteristic
that
comes
through
thats
a
bit
odd
light
feels
lighter
than
the
ccb
gose
still
quite
refreshing
o
kinda
weird
and
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
o
well
my
first
gose
was
definitely
a
positive
experience
its
like
a
wheat
beer
with
a
tart
finish
very
refreshing
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
and
not
unlike
a
german
variation
on
geueze
this
is
a
super
easy
drinking
brew
that
is
tart
and
refreshing
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
provides
a
nice
tingle
on
the
tongue
this
is
light
bodied
and
an
awesome
take
on
the
style
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
nearly
5
i
havent
had
many
gose
offerings
but
this
one
is
by
far
my
favorite
to
date
subtle
salt
addition
with
pleasant
tartness
very
similar
to
the
berliner
weisse
style
but
with
a
bit
of
a
twist
perfect
for
a
brisk
october
weekend
and
a
bargain
at
4
note
nice
and
refreshing
and
i
like
that
you
can
taste
the
malt
the
coriander
isnt
my
style
but
it
does
add
character
its
hard
to
score
this
since
this
is
the
only
gose
ive
come
across
taste
is
tart
with
a
mild
and
palatable
sour
and
definitely
a
little
sodium
bicarbonate
savory
and
complex
on
the
palate
tart
with
mild
coriander
spice
delicately
interwoven
with
some
wheat
and
citrus
flavors
euro
pale
malt
body
is
there
somewhere
light
bodied
but
with
stinging
carbonation
overall
one
of
the
most
complex
authentic
and
amazing
beers
ive
had
of
german
origin
could
drink
this
regularly
o
this
beer
is
very
flavorful
for
its
alcohol
content
and
tastes
great
on
this
hot
day
i
am
newly
interested
in
trying
other
beers
of
this
style
o
the
only
other
gose
ive
tried
is
cascade
brewings
seasonal
gose
and
it
was
excellent
although
american
brewed
so
i
havent
yet
been
able
to
compare
it
to
something
traditional
im
pleasantly
surprised
that
cascades
is
spot
on
and
holds
up
to
this
if
not
is
slightly
better
i
would
buy
this
again
if
it
were
slightly
more
carbonated
and
more
readily
available
well
it
is
an
uncommon
style
at
the
current
time
so
no
hurt
in
checking
it
out
if
it
was
less
pricey
it
could
be
a
very
popular
alternative
to
american
macro
drinkers
who
would
like
something
a
little
more
grade
a
poured
a
2
white
head
which
in
moderate
time
had
completely
dissipated
hazy
light
straw
yellow
color
smells
of
hops
malt
and
spice
taste
doesnt
quite
match
the
smell
theres
more
malt
but
less
hops
and
the
spicing
is
a
very
short
sensation
id
say
this
beer
is
refreshing
perfectly
acceptable
and
quality
but
not
a
standout
this
was
a
good
unique
and
fairly
refreshing
beer
that
i
could
certainly
drink
more
of
just
wish
the
bottle
was
more
affordable
or
better
yet
that
there
was
a
local
brewery
producing
this
style
for
summer
medium
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
is
begs
to
be
gulped
instead
of
sipped
the
body
is
not
heavy
enough
to
stick
around
long
but
is
not
too
thin
to
be
forgettable
the
carbonation
fizzes
away
when
held
on
the
tongue
and
really
moves
this
beer
along
the
carbonation
may
be
a
little
strong
as
combined
with
the
drying
salt
causes
the
flavors
to
fade
rather
fast
the
pour
revealed
what
i
thought
was
initially
going
to
be
a
greg
koch
special
a
fizzy
yellow
beer
until
i
caught
some
unexpected
lees
and
it
turned
cloudy
on
me
i
had
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
very
good
retention
in
the
creeping
humidity
this
evening
color
went
from
a
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
to
a
hazy
orangishyellow
in
just
a
millisecond
depending
on
how
clear
you
want
your
beer
a
gentle
pour
may
be
in
order
the
nose
had
a
pronounced
peppery
odor
thanks
to
the
coriander
but
i
could
swear
that
i
also
caught
some
salt
spray
in
there
salt
pepper
what
a
novel
concept
mouthfeel
was
full
and
brisk
and
it
tasted
like
the
lemon
pepper
seasoning
that
i
like
to
put
on
fish
to
say
that
the
finish
was
dry
would
be
like
saying
that
the
mona
lisa
is
a
painting
this
was
alum
dry
you
could
pour
this
on
electronic
components
in
lieu
of
dessicant
in
terms
of
its
dryness
arid
extra
dry
had
nothing
on
how
dry
this
beer
finished
i
think
that
i
would
now
like
to
drink
a
beer
pours
a
murky
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
1
inch
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
spices
coriander
yeast
and
a
slightly
floral
scent
taste
is
slightly
sour
on
the
first
sip
with
spice
yeast
and
floral
flavors
there
is
a
slightly
acidic
sour
taste
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
but
somehow
it
feels
bubbly
and
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
and
interesting
style
of
beer
i
really
dont
get
any
salty
flavors
from
this
one
a
very
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
o
i
dont
know
if
i
enjoyed
drinking
extra
salt
but
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
good
uniquely
flavored
and
fairly
refreshing
although
i
did
drink
a
glass
of
water
afterward
mouthfeeloverall
very
pleasant
feel
on
the
palate
a
bit
over
light
bodied
and
a
bit
prickly
and
spritzy
seems
appropriate
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
extremely
refreshing
and
great
for
summer
i
wish
more
breweries
took
a
stab
at
this
style
overall
nice
and
light
i
really
liked
the
mild
tartness
i
would
definitely
have
another
cheers
overall
a
good
summer
beer
for
any
occasion
upon
trying
this
again
im
seeing
this
as
my
favorite
gose
the
american
versions
are
getting
too
sour
in
my
opinion
this
brew
has
the
perfect
balance
of
saltiness
and
sour
im
amping
up
my
numbers
on
this
because
i
truly
feel
this
is
the
best
of
its
class
really
great
stuff
and
should
definitely
be
tried
at
some
point
if
youre
enjoying
this
style
o
i
expected
leipziger
gose
to
taste
like
the
hypertension
in
a
bottle
that
is
bruerys
salt
of
the
earth
not
so
leipziger
gose
acts
more
like
a
berliner
weisse
with
a
spicy
twist
very
good
drinkability
and
complexity
more
goses
please
o
impressive
beer
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
the
style
bravo
o
interesting
to
say
the
least
glad
i
tried
it
and
i
would
drink
it
again
o
i
have
never
heard
of
this
beer
style
up
until
today
i
gotta
say
this
is
really
light
and
refreshing
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
for
the
hotter
days
of
summer
o
my
first
gose
was
a
pleasant
experience
this
would
be
a
great
hot
summer
day
beer
o
very
refreshing
beer
this
differs
from
the
dolenitzer
in
two
ways
adding
salt
during
the
boil
and
adding
coriander
when
you
taste
them
side
by
side
you
can
tell
the
differences
i
think
a
blend
of
the
two
would
actually
make
the
best
of
the
two
but
at
this
time
i
believe
the
dolenitzer
takes
the
prize
for
now
overall
i
think
this
beer
is
great
its
a
perfect
hot
summer
day
beer
its
light
crisp
refreshing
and
low
in
alcohol
yet
flavorful
and
interesting
albeit
in
a
total
different
way
than
a
big
imperial
stout
i
wish
it
was
readily
available
in
6
packs
like
so
many
other
beers
that
do
a
much
worse
job
of
trying
to
fill
the
same
role
in
case
you
couldnt
guess
this
is
a
drain
pour
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
lively
this
has
a
a
spritziness
on
the
tongue
and
a
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
tasting
good
at
4
6
abv
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
beer
o
very
enjoyable
slightly
tart
slightly
sweet
hope
to
have
more
gose
in
the
future
good
drinkin
beer
nice
and
flavoursome
but
it
pulls
back
in
the
important
areas
to
make
it
quaffable
salt
is
not
detectable
all
the
more
power
for
it
a
very
dry
but
crisp
and
unusual
beer
surprisingly
moreish
damn
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
until
my
store
runs
out
this
summer
if
it
were
cheaper
according
to
the
history
books
we
almost
lost
gose
as
a
style
shortly
after
ww2
yet
another
reason
to
hate
communism
this
is
a
deliciously
refreshing
notably
unique
and
im
sure
widely
appealing
style
of
beer
that
i
cant
believe
more
breweries
havent
tried
to
emulate
tell
your
friends
tell
your
family
run
out
in
the
street
in
your
underwear
and
start
screaming
do
whatever
it
takes
to
get
others
to
try
this
style
id
be
surprised
if
they
dont
like
it
o
pretty
cool
and
enjoyable
beer
the
salt
is
a
nice
breakup
to
sweetness
would
like
to
try
more
gose
beers
i
would
drink
this
till
the
cows
came
home
a
refreshing
drink
meant
for
summer
and
low
alcohol
for
the
long
hall
every
time
im
able
to
get
my
hands
on
a
new
style
i
take
the
opportunity
to
do
so
and
here
this
paid
off
it
lies
somewhere
between
a
hefe
and
a
witbier
with
its
spicy
quality
and
salty
feel
making
it
a
distinguishable
style
i
feel
like
i
can
drink
this
any
day
of
the
week
and
look
forward
to
having
more
of
this
in
the
future
overall
this
brew
has
made
me
fall
in
love
with
this
obscure
german
style
what
better
brew
to
do
it
than
the
one
from
the
german
town
that
started
it
all
o
im
not
an
expert
on
this
style
but
this
is
a
great
beer
and
as
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
as
ive
had
in
a
long
time
overall
very
crisp
and
clean
dryness
i
found
enjoyable
an
interesting
one
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
perhaps
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
citrusy
summer
dessert
this
is
pretty
crazy
beer
ive
had
scott
smiths
here
it
gose
again
east
end
brewed
gose
this
will
be
my
first
german
brewed
authentic
version
pours
a
deep
yellow
orange
golden
cloudy
color
with
a
bright
white
head
label
calls
it
a
beer
brewed
with
coriander
and
salt
fine
lacing
left
behind
between
sips
beautiful
looking
brew
aroma
at
first
was
bit
sulfurous
with
a
brisk
wind
of
sea
salt
and
lemon
peel
citrus
blends
with
coriander
spice
flavor
is
impressive
really
unique
great
tasting
beer
im
glad
i
finally
gave
this
a
try
every
time
i
had
seen
it
before
it
was
in
a
crazy
shaped
flip
top
bottle
with
a
pretty
high
price
tag
this
11
2
oz
brown
bottle
for
3
something
a
bottle
seemed
much
more
fair
for
never
having
a
real
version
of
this
stuff
spicy
coriander
flows
with
tart
lemon
flavor
perfect
german
wheat
beer
with
a
hint
of
salt
not
salty
you
can
more
or
less
get
the
mineral
aspect
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
super
effervescent
co2
on
the
high
end
really
interesting
unique
beer
that
i
will
be
revisiting
in
the
future
excellent
stuff
pours
a
hazy
golden
wheat
with
a
quickly
dissipating
foam
cap
nose
up
front
is
wheaty
salty
ocean
spray
and
sour
lemon
second
nosing
reveals
more
sea
salt
with
clove
and
coriander
interesting
stuff
similar
to
a
hefe
minus
the
ocean
taste
is
an
interesting
mix
of
sour
red
fruits
wheat
lemon
yeast
spice
the
finish
reveals
briny
sea
notes
and
a
puckering
sourness
never
had
the
style
but
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
and
would
drink
more
often
if
it
was
less
than
5
for
a
12oz
bottle
o
i
like
the
feeling
of
this
and
would
like
to
try
more
in
this
style
not
overpowering
yet
interesting
a
very
nicely
refreshing
and
good
tasting
beer
plus
the
4
60abv
lend
it
to
being
a
good
session
beer
very
unique
and
enjoyable
lepziger
goze
is
as
spritzy
as
my
description
of
its
flavor
makes
it
seem
active
refreshing
carbonation
medium
bodied
for
a
wheat
beer
finishes
clean
nothing
to
complain
about
overall
impression
this
is
an
extremely
refreshing
beer
id
kill
for
this
to
be
available
in
cheap
six
packs
kill
oa
unique
and
interesting
beer
that
everyone
should
try
once
i
could
actually
see
drinking
this
pretty
regularly
as
it
is
refreshing
and
has
a
lot
going
on
for
such
a
light
style
finally
my
first
gose
i
freaked
when
i
saw
this
sitting
on
the
shelf
at
a
store
that
i
hadnt
been
to
in
about
three
months
it
poured
a
murky
muddied
dark
yellow
with
an
orange
aspect
to
it
with
a
frothy
one
finger
white
head
the
head
dissipated
within
a
minute
or
two
and
laced
the
glass
it
smelled
pretty
salty
and
featured
yeast
citrus
and
clove
like
aromas
the
salt
hit
initially
then
calmed
down
the
flavors
are
definitely
interesting
its
primarily
yeast
with
citrus
fruits
cloves
banana
and
light
sodium
it
has
this
odd
effect
on
your
tongue
the
initial
salt
dried
mine
out
and
then
it
made
my
mouth
water
as
the
fruits
hit
it
reminded
me
of
when
you
walk
out
of
the
ocean
and
you
didnt
get
all
of
the
salt
water
off
of
your
lips
normally
id
think
that
was
odd
but
this
is
pretty
flavorful
it
drinks
medium
in
body
and
is
pretty
smooth
it
tingles
the
palate
i
find
this
to
be
pretty
drinkable
its
essentially
a
solid
heavier
wheat
beer
with
citrus
fruits
with
a
touch
of
salt
thank
god
i
finally
got
to
try
this
style
i
may
have
to
go
after
some
others
light
and
refreshing
light
to
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
finishes
dry
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
cpj
vibrant
carbonation
and
crisp
with
a
lower
medium
body
this
beer
seems
like
more
of
a
summer
chill
out
beer
than
anything
else
o
reminiscent
of
berliner
weisse
refreshing
tartness
great
summer
drink
one
could
say
that
it
the
the
german
saison
notes
my
first
gose
interesting
flavors
to
say
the
least
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
isnt
really
my
cup
of
tea
for
something
i
would
want
regularly
overall
fantastic
beer
low
in
alcohol
flavors
are
not
aggressive
or
over
the
top
very
easy
drinking
beer
quite
enjoyable
outstanding
example
of
the
style
soft
carbonation
with
sweet
citrus
flavor
up
front
followed
by
a
spicy
and
earthy
presence
mid
palate
and
an
odd
salty
dry
finish
hints
of
lemon
zest
clove
salt
and
slight
hops
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
slightly
cloudy
very
light
straw
yelloworange
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
very
delicate
aroma
of
lemon
grass
and
orange
the
taste
is
nice
and
light
slightly
sweet
beginning
with
an
underlying
lemon
sweetness
flavor
really
no
bitterness
at
all
i
imagine
this
would
be
a
great
summertime
beer
but
i
guess
it
works
in
the
middle
of
winter
in
mn
no
lace
on
the
glass
not
bad
d
this
is
the
first
gose
ive
ever
tried
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
to
nevertheless
this
was
an
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
off
tap
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
almost
opaque
goldenyellow
color
the
head
was
one
finger
of
offwhite
foam
that
retained
itself
stubbornly
as
a
slim
collar
the
aroma
was
spicy
and
zesty
with
a
nice
fresh
note
of
wheat
the
flavors
impressed
me
straight
up
i
was
hit
first
by
the
wheat
malt
and
strong
citrusy
tang
upon
examining
it
further
i
concluded
it
was
definitely
fresh
wheat
malt
and
kumquats
tart
and
orangelemonlike
in
the
middle
lemon
appeared
along
with
some
booze
and
finally
there
was
a
refreshing
semidry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
lightmed
and
the
carbonation
perfect
the
citruswheattwangbooze
combination
gave
it
an
effect
similar
to
lemonade
i
found
it
highly
refreshing
and
could
no
doubt
see
myself
enjoying
this
greatly
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
one
threw
me
for
a
loop
but
im
seriously
groovin
on
it
not
sure
if
its
to
style
my
guess
is
it
is
but
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
price
tag
sucks
but
ill
buy
it
again
wait
until
the
weather
heats
up
for
a
nice
refreshing
drink
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
on
draft
if
youve
only
tried
the
bottled
version
its
truly
a
night
and
day
difference
cloudy
pale
straw
gold
pour
a
lot
like
a
good
hefe
head
builds
pretty
fast
before
disappearing
this
is
definitely
the
funkier
cousin
of
the
hefeweizen
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
nice
sour
kick
a
miz
netween
the
refreshing
hefe
and
the
sour
berlinner
weiss
this
beer
is
still
very
smooth
but
the
sharp
sourness
really
makes
it
stick
really
need
to
have
this
on
a
nice
summer
day
this
was
my
first
try
for
the
style
but
this
beer
left
more
than
a
good
impression
a
musttry
for
sour
lovers
if
i
can
be
allowed
to
call
this
beer
the
ambassador
of
the
style
i
would
best
describe
gose
as
a
cross
between
a
wit
and
berliner
weisse
with
its
herbal
spice
and
propensity
towards
a
tart
dry
mouthfeel
it
could
be
considered
the
saison
of
leipzig
this
one
is
interesting
different
even
from
the
other
example
id
had
tasty
fairly
refreshing
may
be
the
novelty
of
it
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
not
at
all
what
i
expected
not
a
gamechanger
but
i
also
like
the
fact
that
i
can
reseal
the
swingtop
bottle
easily
save
some
for
later
this
is
pretty
good
beer
not
really
good
pretty
good
upon
opening
there
was
an
immediate
scent
of
caramel
malt
in
the
air
poured
with
a
fizzy
cream
colored
head
that
rapidly
faded
lots
of
little
bubble
trails
and
no
lace
color
is
a
very
slightly
hazy
amber
aroma
is
that
caramel
malt
plus
yeast
a
little
spice
fresh
bread
dough
fresh
baked
cookies
flavor
is
good
not
real
deep
like
the
aroma
just
tart
enough
and
a
little
salt
at
the
end
good
body
and
great
carbonation
finish
is
of
medium
length
although
the
salt
lingers
longer
session
beer
as
for
style
its
like
the
kristalweiss
of
the
berliner
weiss
world
has
a
nose
like
a
berliner
and
an
initial
tart
but
the
feel
is
crisper
and
i
nice
lager
like
feel
nose
is
of
subtle
tart
lactose
and
apple
malt
the
malt
carries
like
that
of
the
sour
apple
and
the
mild
sweet
of
a
good
german
lager
very
jean
feel
fantastic
and
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
have
a
regular
supply
to
have
as
a
relaxation
beer
the
lack
of
creamy
wheat
malt
gives
a
drinkablity
of
few
sour
beers
d
low
abv
tasty
and
complex
very
drinkable
drinkability
as
i
said
this
is
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
the
tartness
isnt
overdone
and
it
makes
the
overall
experience
extremely
enjoyable
as
much
as
i
love
every
other
beer
style
from
the
great
nation
of
germany
i
think
this
one
needs
to
go
by
the
wayside
hv
notes
ive
been
looking
for
the
original
for
quite
some
time
and
here
it
is
the
acidity
is
refreshing
and
the
salinity
adds
an
extra
dimension
of
flavor
it
is
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
dslug
it
the
salt
def
is
a
plus
i
know
a
bunch
of
mexican
dudes
that
do
salt
and
lime
with
their
coronas
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
how
that
tastes
but
without
the
corona
of
course
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
its
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
during
the
summer
months
session
worthy
doesnt
even
begin
to
describe
how
easy
this
beer
is
to
take
down
another
great
german
style
that
could
definitely
fit
in
well
with
sour
beer
fanatics
a
refreshing
very
balanced
brew
the
saltiness
added
another
level
to
this
beer
not
only
in
terms
of
complexity
but
in
drinkability
as
well
cool
this
was
my
first
gose
to
date
and
it
exceeded
my
expectations
close
to
hefeweizens
and
wits
but
i
can
see
where
the
lacto
and
salt
can
really
make
this
style
its
own
i
will
keep
my
eyes
peeled
for
future
examples
d
at
4
5
and
with
this
flavor
profile
this
is
a
very
drinkabke
and
refreshing
beer
pours
a
hazy
maize
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
wheat
slight
tart
malt
pale
hops
citrus
lemon
slight
pale
malt
and
hint
of
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
gose
mouth
feel
is
slightly
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
tartness
tastes
of
lemon
sweet
malt
slight
pale
malt
hint
of
hops
and
hint
of
wheat
ive
never
had
a
gose
before
but
this
seems
to
fit
the
description
pretty
well
update
now
it
is
available
in
small
bottles
333
ml
we
found
them
last
week
in
abes
store
for
4
25
each
the
historical
bottle
750
ml
content
was
not
seen
at
all
good
that
we
kept
ours
from
last
year
i
love
the
way
the
tartness
and
salt
play
off
each
other
the
coriander
just
adds
an
extra
depth
to
the
beer
if
a
beer
could
be
brewed
similar
to
this
and
released
in
a
responsibly
priced
6pk
damn
money
in
the
bank
until
then
this
appears
to
be
the
only
commercially
available
gose
available
in
a
bottle
in
the
us
for
now
drinkability
a
very
interesting
wheaty
beer
this
beer
is
incredibly
subtle
and
soft
in
its
flavors
i
could
sip
on
several
of
these
and
do
want
it
again
would
be
really
interested
to
try
this
on
tap
ive
always
wanted
to
try
a
gose
and
now
i
have
im
not
sure
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
bottle
of
this
but
i
would
not
turn
it
down
however
id
love
to
find
a
biergarten
in
liepzig
and
have
a
few
of
these
a
light
bodied
low
alcohol
unique
refresher
not
something
ill
be
craving
often
but
unique
regardless
the
larger
bottle
was
sold
in
a
uniquely
shaped
longnecked
flip
top
bottle
which
i
understand
to
be
the
traditional
gose
bottle
that
said
its
unique
shape
is
a
pain
to
store
and
would
be
even
worse
to
ship
in
a
trade
too
bad
dnice
summer
beer
lots
of
corriander
and
tart
lemon
flavors
could
be
a
bit
drier
i
was
expecting
something
more
extreme
but
its
crisp
refreshing
and
def
has
sourness
to
it
as
i
drink
more
i
can
feel
the
sourness
more
would
love
this
on
tap
at
a
bar
d
a
really
interesting
combination
of
flavors
here
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
know
how
much
of
this
stuff
i
could
drinkplus
these
seem
to
be
hard
to
find
around
here
dear
american
craft
brewers
start
brewing
with
salt
what
a
great
beer
and
what
a
style
ive
discovered
here
now
get
me
another
bottle
drinkability
1
is
enough
for
me
had
to
try
the
style
a
bit
too
flowery
herbal
and
spicy
for
me
glad
i
got
to
try
it
though
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
golden
with
a
smaller
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
the
aroma
has
lemons
coriander
some
saltiness
and
white
grapes
appreciate
how
the
coriander
is
not
overpowering
which
it
easily
can
be
the
flavor
has
white
grape
juice
some
appreciable
tartness
then
the
finish
develops
some
coriander
spice
notes
and
light
malts
light
bodied
with
a
prickly
refreshing
carbonation
i
really
dig
this
brew
light
refreshing
fruity
and
tart
i
would
drink
this
often
if
it
werent
for
a
prohibitive
price
tag
huge
on
the
drinkability
meter
this
was
fresh
crisp
and
flowed
so
easily
i
could
go
through
10
of
these
on
a
long
summer
afternoon
this
is
a
way
underrated
beer
that
should
come
in
six
packs
and
be
sold
on
every
corner
felt
like
i
could
drink
several
of
these
but
decided
to
try
something
else
new
i
look
forward
to
drinking
more
of
this
particular
beer
and
other
goses
in
general
an
intereting
beer
and
after
having
this
one
example
a
style
that
needs
to
be
explored
more
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
had
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thin
cap
just
a
little
lacing
is
left
behind
the
aroma
is
that
of
a
witbier
it
consists
of
yeasty
phenols
and
coriander
with
hints
of
lemon
and
sour
apples
the
flavor
starts
with
wheat
malt
then
it
turns
mildly
tart
then
slightly
salty
in
the
finish
the
spice
is
not
really
noticed
at
all
the
body
feels
a
bit
thin
and
flat
an
enjoyable
beer
and
none
of
the
unique
elements
are
too
robust
so
it
should
not
scare
anyone
away
pours
a
very
hazy
lemon
straw
with
a
fairly
thick
white
foamy
head
that
disappears
almost
entirely
after
a
minute
or
so
the
smell
is
heavy
on
the
lemon
with
dashes
of
cracked
pepper
salt
and
very
subtle
hops
the
taste
generally
follows
the
nose
with
the
coriander
hiking
up
the
lemony
flavor
pushing
the
pepper
to
the
back
and
nearly
drowning
out
the
hops
bitterness
in
the
end
a
general
saltiness
coming
through
on
the
back
and
sides
of
the
tongue
this
overall
fruitiness
and
spiciness
makes
for
a
pretty
distinctive
tasting
that
coupled
with
a
generously
medium
body
and
low
abv
makes
for
a
nicely
drinkable
brew

notes
naturally
this
was
my
first
review
of
a
gose
i
was
pleased
with
this
beer
because
i
appreciate
wheat
beers
when
they
are
wellmade
however
it
is
less
amazing
than
the
rarity
of
this
style
might
lead
one
to
believe
that
said
id
love
to
see
more
german
brewers
start
brewing
gose
beers
again
as
well
as
get
some
american
interpretations
out
there
as
far
as
rare
styles
go
its
rather
mundane
but
if
gose
was
a
more
common
style
id
choose
this
when
i
felt
like
a
light
wheat
beer
but
not
a
hefeweizen
i
think
the
taste
is
a
treati
get
the
saltseaspicebrine
at
the
beginning
and
then
that
gives
way
to
a
prickly
sweet
taste
with
some
apple
flavors
and
a
tart
wheat
backbone
with
a
bit
of
the
brine
and
salt
again
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
bright
truly
a
oneofakind
beer
i
would
consider
moving
to
leipzig
just
so
i
could
have
this
all
the
time
d
in
the
summertime
this
would
be
the
perfect
solution
to
a
hot
day
crisp
refreshing
lots
of
lemon
this
must
be
what
widmer
is
always
trying
to
attain
lol
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
i
would
purchase
it
again
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
d
this
one
was
different
for
sure
not
sure
i
would
order
this
again
but
i
couldnt
pass
up
a
style
i
have
never
tried
before
as
the
beer
warms
i
finally
taste
the
salt
dont
think
it
really
adds
much
to
the
taste
if
this
is
true
to
style
the
gose
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
dexcessively
so
tons
of
flavour
with
a
very
interesting
salty
spiciness
all
of
this
with
a
low
abvglad
to
see
this
rare
style
rescued
from
the
beer
graveyard
nice
stuff
for
sure
first
time
every
having
this
beer
and
hopefully
i
can
try
more
this
style
it
is
a
light
beverage
and
as
such
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
for
a
sour
anyway
unfortunately
there
just
isnt
much
more
to
it
than
that
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
fell
quickly
with
no
lacing
predominate
aroma
is
orange
followed
by
wheat
and
a
light
acidity
flavor
is
very
interesting
and
unique
this
is
my
first
gose
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
completely
expect
but
im
actually
digging
the
light
saltiness
in
the
background
flavor
lightly
tart
but
its
not
on
the
same
level
as
a
berliner
weiss
there
plenty
of
coriander
its
followed
by
a
crisp
wheat
twang
and
some
more
citrus
qualities
that
were
present
in
the
nose
very
orangey
and
i
like
it
crisp
light
body
refreshing
interesting
stuff
doesnt
taste
a
whole
lot
different
than
other
german
wheats
except
the
addition
of
salt
which
really
isnt
overlypresent
but
it
was
pretty
good
and
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
style
my
first
gose
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
looking
forward
to
finding
some
more
i
never
thought
that
i
would
enjoy
a
beer
with
salt
in
the
taste
go
figure
d
id
never
had
one
of
these
before
but
i
had
a
bit
of
an
idea
going
in
what
this
would
be
like
the
tart
sourness
is
actually
quite
refreshing
the
low
abv
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
d
fairly
drinkable
in
that
its
easy
on
the
palate
and
alcohol
is
not
an
issue
the
spice
and
saltiness
of
the
finish
gets
a
little
old
for
me
d
so
so
not
my
favorite
of
styles
pours
a
bright
see
through
yellow
color
with
medium
sized
fluffy
snow
white
head
big
wheat
aroma
in
the
nose
sans
the
cloveyfruity
esters
given
off
by
most
weizens
and
wits
this
is
more
rugged
in
its
wheat
profile
more
grainy
in
aroma
an
apple
juice
sweetness
lay
beneath
its
flavor
very
crisp
and
refreshing
lightly
spicy
and
a
mild
tangy
sourness
hits
the
tongue
late
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
an
enjoyable
pounder
any
time
but
this
one
would
be
sure
thing
come
mid
summer
the
only
ive
had
in
the
style
and
would
like
to
try
more
interesting
flavors
low
in
alcohol
and
yet
surprisingly
refreshing
i
would
like
to
see
other
examples
of
this
style
the
flavor
profile
is
not
one
that
i
personally
love
but
the
balance
nuance
and
boldness
of
flavor
in
such
a
small
beer
is
astounding
not
just
a
curiousity
this
brew
delivers
the
goods
classic
example
of
a
weizen
very
drinkable
to
be
sought
after
d
quite
drinkablethis
is
light
and
fairly
low
in
alcohol
and
the
uniqueness
of
the
beer
keeps
me
wanting
another
sip
d
very
drinkable
and
a
great
summer
beer
quite
a
unique
brew
which
i
think
would
be
very
decent
without
the
salt
but
is
intriguing
for
its
inclusion
its
a
hard
to
find
style
but
if
you
can
come
across
one
id
recommend
the
purchase
just
drink
a
big
ol
glass
of
water
afterwards
poured
from
the
cool
long
neck
swingtop
bottle
into
my
gaffel
kölsch
glass
leipziger
appears
a
mildly
cloudy
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
good
inch
of
fluffy
bone
white
head
nice
lingering
foam
leaving
some
spotty
lace
in
its
wake
as
i
sip
my
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
citrus
notes
such
as
tart
lemon
peel
and
zest
salt
light
toasted
wheat
saltine
crackers
coriander
spicy
yeast
light
bodied
and
quite
effervescent
very
quenching
i
could
see
this
paired
with
a
variety
of
foods
im
thinking
crackers
topped
with
bonelessskinless
sardines
packed
in
olive
oil
with
a
squeeze
of
fresh
lemon
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
price
tag
would
keep
it
off
my
casual
drinking
list
will
buy
again
for
a
special
occasion
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sour
wheat
beers
but
this
one
is
not
as
offensive
as
most
and
was
decently
enjoyable
a
small
glass
is
satisfying
for
me
maybe
not
the
most
drinkable
brew
note
this
was
sampled
at
maxs
in
baltimore
they
had
three
kegs
available
and
my
sample
was
taken
from
keg
3
of
3
i
have
been
told
that
each
keg
has
tasted
differently
which
makes
my
review
somewhat
less
relevant
to
the
overall
assessment
of
this
beer
it
seems
that
someone
can
easily
get
a
good
glass
of
this
beer
and
next
door
someone
might
get
a
bad
glass
mildly
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
thin
white
head
retention
is
decent
and
theres
patchy
lace
too
on
the
nose
this
is
fabulous
savory
with
salt
and
coriander
coupled
with
a
mild
tartness
this
is
just
so
refreshing
fresh
cut
cilantro
comes
to
mind
as
i
drink
this
light
bodied
beer
mildly
tart
with
a
combination
of
lemony
and
lactic
sourness
the
tartness
really
opens
to
palate
to
the
combination
of
the
salt
and
coriander
this
works
wonderfully
mildly
wheatybready
this
is
excellent
dry
and
mildly
tart
on
the
finish
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
nothing
spectacular
here
but
still
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
appreciate
beer
the
sort
of
thing
one
could
easily
drink
all
day
without
doing
too
much
harm
nice
overall
it
went
down
ok
but
it
wasnt
something
i
really
overly
enjoyed
either
just
ok
a
little
too
watery
a
little
too
saltytart
and
just
not
enough
to
make
me
chase
this
one
again
tap
hamiltons
first
gose
ive
had
poured
a
hazy
but
bright
yellowgold
with
a
fizzy
yellow
head
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
in
the
carbonation
floral
aroma
as
in
i
smell
rose
bushes
toasted
bread
lemon
and
wheat
popping
mouthfeel
that
enhances
the
acididy
of
the
beer
sweet
spiced
flavor
with
a
lot
of
acidity
tangy
wheat
and
a
strange
limeyeastflower
petal
taste
dry
crisp
finish
it
was
nice
just
impossible
to
pin
down
what
it
was
interesting
and
a
good
sour
d
ok
i
would
probably
not
have
more
than
1
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
it
was
easy
to
drink
that
one
this
beer
is
light
yellow
and
clear
it
pours
with
a
serious
head
but
it
falls
away
to
almost
nothing
really
quick
there
is
steady
carbonation
small
bubbles
im
drinking
this
out
of
a
radeberger
pilsner
flute
the
best
vessel
i
could
find
the
smell
is
interesting
spice
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
corridander
maybe
the
taste
its
amazing
lactic
sourness
sweetness
spice
comes
through
this
beer
is
so
refreshing
my
wife
loves
it
as
well
its
a
great
drink
all
around
well
done
why
are
you
still
reading
go
get
it
a
nicely
refreshing
and
surprisingly
sour
fruity
beer
right
up
my
alley
d
an
extremely
unique
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
the
aroma
is
spectacular
it
smells
like
oil
squeezed
out
of
a
fresh
lemon
peel
though
the
flavor
is
not
quite
as
good
this
one
is
a
must
try
if
you
come
across
it
and
the
style
is
deserving
of
the
revival
is
it
experiencing
d
light
yet
complex
nice
intro
to
sours
but
not
much
heavier
in
flavor
than
a
diet
lemony
water
drink
on
tap
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
hazy
gold
color
thick
white
head
tiny
bit
of
lacing
aroma
of
wheat
and
citrus
very
tart
lemon
taste
some
malt
wellbalanced
the
beer
had
a
real
piquancy
to
it
and
was
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
will
have
it
again
d
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ive
ever
had
goes
down
smooth
and
doesnt
feel
like
much
im
sad
i
cant
get
this
more
readily
because
after
a
long
hot
day
this
would
be
primetime
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
what
a
revelationj
this
beer
is
ontap
id
had
it
a
couple
of
times
in
the
bottle
before
and
while
i
thought
it
was
interesting
and
pretty
good
it
didnt
really
grab
me
as
a
style
or
a
beer
once
i
had
it
on
tap
this
summer
at
the
brick
store
pub
i
just
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
it
seems
that
at
least
every
other
time
i
would
go
to
the
pub
i
would
order
one
of
these
and
it
just
kept
getting
better
and
better
particularly
if
it
were
hot
outside
the
bottles
are
also
quite
expensive
so
this
is
relatively
a
much
better
deal
so
refreshing
and
the
touch
of
salt
an
loads
of
coriander
eventually
made
it
addictive
for
me
something
just
seemed
to
click
with
this
beer
on
draft
pours
a
super
carbonated
pale
yellow
with
a
very
white
fluffy
head
smells
very
slightly
sour
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
green
apple
and
spicy
with
fresh
wheat
and
you
can
smell
a
slight
salty
tang
tastes
very
very
refreshing
lots
of
coriander
and
some
crisp
wheat
up
front
and
then
the
salty
tang
is
quite
noticeable
against
a
background
of
light
citrusy
sourness
and
tannic
salty
bitterness
this
part
of
the
beer
is
reminiscent
of
a
salting
crabapples
that
i
remember
doing
as
a
child
in
the
south
the
salt
corander
citrus
and
bitterness
fronted
by
the
spicy
wheat
just
works
some
type
of
alchemy
is
surely
at
work
here
thirst
quenching
in
the
mouth
with
the
slightest
bit
of
prickliness
and
perfectly
refreshing
my
new
favorite
summer
beer
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beverage
this
is
my
first
gose
and
was
fairly
impressed
worth
a
shot
so
refreshing
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
deeper
flavor
profile
not
bad
but
id
rather
go
with
a
berlinner
weisse
or
hefeweizen
drank
on
tap
at
brauhaus
schmitz
pours
a
glowing
yellow
color
with
small
white
head
looks
like
a
glass
of
sunshine
and
smells
of
a
sweet
citrus
lemongrass
intial
taste
of
slight
honey
and
corriander
then
a
solid
lemon
flavor
not
too
overpowering
though
great
summer
beer
not
too
heavy
could
drink
all
day
under
the
hot
sun
d
rather
drinkable
not
sure
if
id
session
this
because
i
like
beers
with
a
bit
more
flavor
still
a
solid
brew
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
white
sudsy
head
to
it
head
recedes
rather
quickly
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
spots
here
and
there
nose
is
of
lemons
some
saltiness
yeasts
some
heavy
spicing
taste
is
a
lot
more
mellow
than
i
expected
i
had
only
ever
tasted
a
gose
before
at
a
tasting
and
i
wanted
to
rip
my
tongue
out
this
is
pretty
damn
good
taste
is
very
lemony
and
yeasty
up
front
but
the
coriander
kicks
in
quite
nicely
and
not
overdone
sour
kicks
in
during
the
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
taste
makes
it
feel
heavier
though
its
light
on
the
tongue
medium
carbonation
slick
and
oily
feel
to
it
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
is
hitting
the
spot
on
this
warm
and
muggy
night
not
sure
i
could
put
away
more
than
two
of
these
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
this
brew
pours
up
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
big
white
fizzy
head
the
nose
is
pretty
faint
light
fruits
faint
malts
the
taste
is
salty
lemons
faint
malts
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
light
bodied
low
carbo
would
make
a
good
sessioner
i
can
finally
afford
a
young
crazy
stripper
wife
on
a
whim
picked
up
a
bottle
at
the
wine
gallery
boston
for
4
99
ive
only
had
a
gose
once
and
it
was
years
ago
poured
into
a
short
stange
glass
very
cloudy
yellow
body
bubbly
white
head
but
a
noticeable
lack
of
carbonation
bubbles
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
smelled
a
bit
peppery
lemony
and
grassy
taste
was
smoother
than
i
would
have
though
had
a
very
wheatlike
flavor
and
definitely
some
spice
like
coriander
i
didnt
really
notice
the
salt
until
after
the
swallow
makes
your
palate
feel
dry
like
you
just
ate
some
pretzels
a
dry
doughy
aftertaste
its
a
very
smooth
beer
due
to
the
low
abv
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
while
not
abundantly
flavorful
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
its
bottle
conditioned
so
watch
out
for
the
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
a
nice
reintroduction
to
an
obscure
style
who
would
think
that
all
those
things
together
coulc
be
so
good
a
crisp
lightmedium
bodied
easy
drinking
wheat
the
slightest
dip
in
carbonation
lends
it
a
different
feel
i
found
in
varying
pours
from
the
750ml
bottle
very
nice
feel
usually
and
for
the
most
part
i
had
a
bottle
which
i
poured
into
a
glass
i
didnt
decant
to
try
and
remove
the
yeast
i
swirled
the
yeast
just
like
a
hefeweizen
and
added
it
to
the
glass
the
spicy
taste
and
the
saltiness
came
right
out
when
i
drank
the
beer
i
liked
the
taste
very
little
hop
bitterness
i
found
it
easy
to
drink
but
the
saltiness
might
get
to
some
folks

highly

this
for

into

glad
to

the

still
left
drinkability
well
that
was
weird
dunno
if
this
is
a
stylebeer
i
could
have
too
often
but
it
does
seem
like
it
would
have
its
place
and
time
the
abv
is
low
the
flavors
light
and
fairly
refreshing
ill
give
it
a
hesitant
recommendation
especially
if
youre
lookin
to
knock
out
a
style
c
great
beer
in
comparison
to
a
traditional
kriek
this
beer
definitely
has
the
balance
i
prefer
though
this
doesnt
mean
the
kriek
iswas
poor
definitely
more
in
line
with
a
berliner
weißbier
the
floaties
in
the
beer
also
add
a
cool
effect
to
the
experience
and
leaves
no
doubt
to
the
fact
that
this
is
unfiltered
and
bottle
conditioned
prost
m
d
crisp
refreshing
and
yet
it
has
a
bit
of
a
moderate
body
not
too
light
feeling
at
all
a
wonderful
dryness
follows
and
im
always
a
sucker
for
that
an
enjoyable
and
unique
beer
id
actively
seek
it
out
again
and
it
would
make
for
a
wonderful
session
choice
i
dont
really
have
any
other
reference
point
but
this
was
interesting
and
enjoyable
that
said
absolutely
not
worth
the
price
as
a
regular
drinking
beer
since
this
is
probably
the
only
one
you
can
ever
get
your
hands
on
in
the
states
try
it
once
just
to
check
this
off
your
list
of
beer
styles
and
move
on
great
session
brew
alternative
its
like
a
saison
light
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
smoothness
from
the
wheat
this
is
my
first
gose
i
like
the
style
based
on
this
one
di
dont
really
know
how
i
would
rate
this
regarding
drinkability
it
certainly
expands
the
borders
of
flavor
for
me
and
in
a
positive
way
i
just
dont
know
if
this
is
my
choice
for
any
particular
reason
its
worth
a
try
and
enjoyable
if
you
let
it
get
a
little
bit
warm
the
fruit
esters
come
out
then
overall
this
was
crip
tasty
and
refreshing
a
wonderfully
light
and
airy
brew
with
still
a
ton
of
complex
flavor
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
75
degree
night
in
february
as
was
the
case
this
time
d
this
beer
and
style
really
has
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
thing
going
for
it
the
flavor
is
a
bit
strange
and
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
i
dig
it
just
has
that
nice
touch
of
sweet
and
savory
goin
for
it
and
then
it
has
that
medicinal
flavor
i
am
pretty
sure
if
you
drink
this
when
you
have
a
sore
throat
cured
great
beer
and
i
dig
the
style
look
forward
to
tracking
down
more
of
these
d
drinkable
in
the
same
way
that
water
with
lemons
is
drinkable
i
could
probably
go
for
some
heavier
fare
though
huh
well
thats
a
funny
beer
its
sour
and
subtle
i
cant
say
that
i
particularly
love
anything
about
it
but
its
a
fairly
unique
beer
in
my
experience
the
predominant
flavor
is
yogurt
of
the
berliner
weisse
variety
of
yogurt
flavors
the
spices
are
subtle
with
coriander
coming
through
strongest
there
are
some
fruit
notes
to
the
beer
some
apricot
some
plums
the
sourness
is
light
and
not
very
strong
the
feel
is
a
touch
watery
i
think
that
i
would
prefer
it
a
bit
colder
not
that
id
like
the
flavor
diminished
but
it
would
help
the
feel
okay
beer
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
kind
of
muddy
looking
thick
white
head
forms
tight
bubbles
slowly
settles
down
to
a
thin
ring
and
layer
some
lace
spots
smell
is
neat
some
sweetness
honey
oats
banana
light
fruit
some
saltiness
orange
peel
almost
witbier
like
light
spice
pretty
interesting
taste
is
interesting
very
light
on
flavour
almost
a
tea
and
salt
combination
almost
jasmine
salt
slightly
vegetal
acidic
finish
some
spice
but
slightly
watery
vinegarbrine
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
saltiness
feels
a
bit
funny
but
otherwise
i
could
see
this
being
refreshing
in
the
summer
you
look
at
it
and
youd
just
assume
it
was
a
hefeweizen
if
you
didnt
know
better
the
cloudy
orangedarktan
body
topped
by
a
large
lumpy
longlasting
white
cloud
of
a
head
fill
the
requirements
of
good
looking
hefeweizens
the
aroma
then
throws
you
for
a
loop
that
distinctive
coriander
scent
doesnt
belong
here
if
this
was
a
hefeweizen
plus
its
missing
much
of
the
bananabubblegum
esters
of
a
good
hefeweizen
although
a
slight
phenolic
notes
makes
this
smell
much
like
youd
expect
from
a
witbier
on
the
first
sip
i
noticed
a
sour
twang
that
toned
down
drastically
in
further
sips
the
coriander
makes
for
a
nice
bit
of
character
in
the
flavor
and
the
salt
really
shows
itself
mostly
in
meshing
with
the
backend
bitterness
but
ill
qualify
that
with
the
fact
that
im
a
salt
fiend
so
my
salt
threshhold
may
be
a
little
high
theres
something
missing
though
it
lacks
the
bold
wheatiness
or
the
creamy
mouthfeel
of
a
good
hefeweizen
its
still
a
very
unique
drinkable
beer
d
a
great
beer
that
i
could
drink
every
day
superbly
balanced
and
highly
unique
refreshing
and
low
in
alcohol
this
is
a
tough
beer
to
beat
in
terms
of
drinkability
take
a
witbier
and
a
berlinerweisse
and
leipziger
gose
would
be
the
child
though
this
is
my
first
time
trying
a
gose
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
more
if
it
were
available
i
do
hope
to
see
more
beers
of
this
style
in
the
future
as
this
is
an
extraordinary
beverage
bottle
from
winking
lizard
this
brew
is
a
cloudy
yellowgold
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
diminishes
slowly
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
of
citrus
and
yeast
mediumbodied
with
a
tart
fruity
character
and
flavors
of
yeast
and
spices
along
with
mildly
sweet
wheat
the
finish
is
fruity
and
leaves
a
tart
citrus
aftertaste
decent
overall
drinking
gose
demands
an
acquired
taste
for
nearly
spicy
beer
i
had
this
one
from
the
traditional
glass
bottle
which
has
a
thin
neck
and
then
a
fat
base
the
aroma
is
certainly
the
spiciest
that
i
have
ever
tried
which
is
unique
for
a
german
beer
there
is
also
some
fruitiness
as
well
there
arent
many
outstanding
east
german
beers
which
is
why
i
appreciated
gose
and
also
for
its
daring
taste
worth
a
try
notes
from
022406
d
a
unique
brew
im
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
something
from
this
style
pricey
but
worth
a
go
poured
a
16
9oz
bottle
into
my
triple
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
honey
brown
with
a
big
eggshell
white
head
and
left
just
an
intermittent
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
honey
with
banana
clove
and
just
a
hint
of
pectic
tartness
the
flavor
is
wheat
malts
crisp
green
apples
just
a
lightly
mild
funky
tartness
and
a
salty
mixture
that
sticks
to
your
teeth
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
and
slightly
dry
this
would
be
a
wonderful
drink
on
a
hot
day
d
a
real
sleeper
in
my
fridge
i
had
no
idea
gose
would
be
this
appealing
perfect
for
warm
weather
clean
and
thirst
quenching
i
only
wish
i
had
a
bigger
bottle
clean
and
drinks
well
for
such
a
puckering
offering
enjoyable
change
of
pace
this
was
a
really
interesting
light
and
refreshing
beer
definitely
a
nice
change
from
the
typical
warm
weather
brew
d
drinkability
is
good
this
one
is
fairly
light
and
refreshing
throughout
several
could
easily
be
consumed
in
one
session
i
can
see
this
one
being
very
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
alas
it
is
october
and
there
is
a
chill
in
the
air
this
is
my
first
exposure
to
the
gose
style
and
has
piqued
my
interest
to
try
more
will
i
have
this
one
again
probably
not
pours
a
light
solid
body
with
a
twofinger
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
some
lacings
a
sharp
citric
smell
hit
my
nose
first
and
there
are
hints
of
spices
like
clove
reminded
me
of
a
wit
in
the
smell
dept
smooth
and
mediumbodied
orange
and
lemon
peel
seem
to
be
the
main
things
i
taste
giving
it
a
somewhat
sour
and
tart
feeling
it
is
also
a
little
veggielike
and
a
little
grassy
like
a
mix
between
a
hefe
and
a
pils
or
a
cheap
adjunt
filled
american
macro
also
some
spices
and
hints
of
hops
and
finishes
slick
i
dont
know
ive
never
had
a
gose
before
and
it
was
a
good
beer
but
my
overall
feeling
is
that
it
is
like
a
hefe
with
a
more
pronounced
sour
fruittartness
to
it
id
have
this
again
but
i
am
not
going
to
actively
seek
out
more
beers
made
in
this
style
another
interesting
summer
option
but
unfortunately
like
most
summer
beers
imho
well
short
of
great
d
makes
me
thirsty
the
salt
keeps
it
from
being
refreshing
gose
is
not
exactly
the
interesting
beer
id
hoped
it
would
be
im
not
exactly
sure
what
could
improve
this
beer
its
my
first
experience
with
a
gose
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
an
above
average
beer
that
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
out
again
it
is
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
though
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
it
often
taste
mouthfeel
salty
and
tart
mildly
acidic
with
a
dry
malt
backing
coriander
is
up
front
as
well
lending
further
depth
to
the
flavor
what
an
odd
combination
this
is
but
it
somehow
works
the
body
is
light
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
fairly
clean
with
a
hint
of
tang
from
the
salt
lingering
on
the
tongue
d
great
citrusy
flavor
with
a
slick
palate
makes
for
a
thirst
quenching
summer
time
beer
overall
a
decent
good
brew
and
drinkability
a
great
beer
this
is
my
first
experience
with
gose
and
i
have
to
say
that
im
a
big
fan
very
flavorful
and
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
other
beers
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
fluffy
three
finger
bright
white
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
lacing
is
pretty
nonexistant
with
a
fair
amount
of
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
smell
is
very
fresh
and
clean
consisting
of
lemon
fresh
cut
grass
and
some
wheat
a
bit
of
pepper
and
spice
tickle
the
nose
as
well
light
and
refreshing
smell
overall
taste
is
very
much
the
same
beginning
with
lemongrass
apple
and
hay
followed
by
sweet
wheat
slight
citrus
hops
midway
with
a
mild
salty
bread
flavor
aftertaste
is
slightly
dry
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
honey
light
and
crisp
body
with
a
slick
feel
very
refreshing
beer
one
that
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
bbqing
id
drink
this
over
a
hefe
anyday
thanks
a
ton
greg
for
continuously
hooking
me
up
with
amazing
beers
i
look
forward
to
our
future
trades
again
and
again
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
a
unique
brew
that
could
use
more
richness
on
the
palate
the
aroma
is
unique
and
nicely
concentrated
along
with
a
taste
that
falls
short
of
anything
special
pours
a
hazy
strawtoapricot
with
a
very
quickly
disappearing
white
head
scents
of
lemon
orange
zest
and
coriander
much
of
the
same
appears
on
the
tongue
with
some
slightly
soursharp
twinge
that
calls
to
mind
salt
and
margarita
meeting
at
the
rim
of
a
glass
finshes
off
a
little
like
a
sweetart
feels
a
touch
thicker
than
the
average
wheat
based
beer
refreshing
and
not
at
all
cloying
in
spite
of
the
rather
intense
fruitiness
a
nice
summer
brew
id
take
over
the
standard
weiss
worth
a
try
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
its
my
first
beer
in
this
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
its
a
very
good
lighter
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
this
intersesting
style
of
a
bier
pours
out
super
carbonated
very
murky
a
yeasty
thick
mustardgrain
color
the
beers
holds
a
three
finger
head
leaving
good
lacing
for
about
two
minutes
the
aromas
are
summery
lemonsbarley
grains
corander
much
like
a
belgian
wit
effervescent
light
mouthfeel
tart
lemony
flavors
spicy
corianders
bitter
oranges
the
flavors
left
at
the
corners
of
my
toungue
is
actually
quite
salty
making
another
sip
after
sip
come
easily
it
is
very
interesting
to
drink
something
as
unique
as
this
personally
i
prefer
a
good
wit
or
hefe
but
the
flavor
profile
matched
exactly
the
description
a
very
true
representation
of
the
style
it
only
tastes
better
fresh
in
berlin
this
has
an
appealing
mineral
vibe
and
its
dryness
of
textureflavor
as
well
as
the
yeast
character
makes
it
drink
much
like
a
belgian
saison
although
there
are
clearly
differences
as
much
as
i
enjoy
it
its
sharptartdry
elements
wouldnt
have
me
returning
that
often
now
how
exactly
does
this
comply
with
the
reinheitsgebot
i
thought
the
use
of
things
like
coriander
and
salt
in
any
german
beer
was
strictly
verboten
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fairly
thin
making
it
more
drinkable
but
the
aforementioned
salt
taste
results
in
thoughts
of
drinking
beer
brine
which
i
imagine
would
be
displeasing
it
is
possible
that
this
style
simply
creates
a
dissonance
with
my
palate
ill
have
to
search
out
another
as
confirmation
or
try
this
again
down
the
road
as
a
gose
novice
this
is
not
what
i
would
describe
as
an
enjoyable
tasting
beer
but
its
fringe
qualities
are
d
a
nice
drinker
btw
i
just
poured
the
last
of
the
bottle
and
took
another
sip
and
im
just
getting
a
smidgeon
of
malty
sweetness
that
i
didnt
notice
before
another
added
treat
to
an
already
most
enjoyable
brew
thanks
again
alan
drinkability
is
high
as
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
good
flavor
and
low
alcohol
make
it
even
easier
a
very
sessionable
brew
overall
i
think
this
was
a
great
beer
however
it
was
overpriced
almost
18
00
at
sams
in
chicago
i
should
mention
that
it
came
in
a
different
bottle
from
the
one
shown
in
the
picture
but
definitely
the
same
beer
poured
a
nice
hazy
golden
brown
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipated
into
some
chunk
lacing
the
smell
is
of
buttery
malt
and
pepper
a
noticable
creamy
funk
definitely
the
coriander
and
white
pepper
spices
the
taste
is
of
light
coriander
and
white
pepper
there
is
a
bready
malt
that
carries
the
salt
flavor
to
the
back
of
the
brew
there
is
a
noticable
lemony
citrus
sourness
to
this
brew
the
feel
is
of
a
moderate
bready
malt
and
light
to
prickly
carbonation
a
nice
bready
malt
brew
with
a
kick
of
spice
and
salt
to
give
this
a
unique
flavor
i
was
expecting
some
sourness
but
it
didnt
materialize
the
salt
was
a
little
distracting
but
then
im
not
a
fan
of
salty
foods
so
it
may
not
be
for
others
id
like
to
try
another
brand
of
gose
apperance
pale
yellow
with
haze
huge
white
head
that
went
down
quickly
and
left
a
nice
lace
around
the
edge
smell
sour
and
acidic
come
to
mind
taste
much
the
same
as
the
smell
a
little
like
a
lambic
mouthfeel
light
in
body
high
in
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
could
have
one
or
two
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
not
the
best
on
a
cold
ny
night
d
not
bad
at
all
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
i
like
this
brew
its
pretty
tasty
and
goes
down
ok
the
acidity
might
be
a
bit
tiring
after
a
few
but
i
guess
thats
why
the
traditionalists
add
syrup
as
im
getting
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
im
getting
a
little
tired
of
it
i
imagine
it
would
be
mighty
delicious
with
some
thrown
in
overall
recommended
a
very
interesting
almost
extinct
style
lots
of
flavor
given
the
abv
as
well
you
may
not
like
the
salt
but
hopefully
youll
appreciate
its
uniqueness
pours
a
clouded
amber
gold
nose
is
yeasty
and
citrus
flavor
is
yeasty
slightly
wheaty
and
leaves
a
long
citric
flavor
on
the
tongue
it
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
belgian
brew
and
a
german
quite
interesting
really
definite
spice
influence
though
i
have
to
admit
that
my
palate
for
spices
is
immature
so
i
cant
pick
them
out
as
i
should
be
able
to
on
the
mouth
it
is
low
in
carbonation
but
slightly
thick
in
ingredients
extremely
drinkable
like
i
said
this
was
the
last
bottle
to
be
had
where
i
bought
it
if
you
see
it
go
for
it
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
it
just
didnt
have
a
good
complex
taste
or
feel
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
pours
deep
copper
with
a
nice
white
head
the
beer
was
bottle
conditioned
so
there
are
a
few
floaties
in
the
glass
the
aromas
off
of
this
one
are
a
bit
funky
but
give
way
to
that
of
the
ocean
cranberry
and
sour
cherries
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
tart
with
hints
of
the
sour
cherries
the
finish
is
quick
and
dry
a
very
nice
brew
its
too
bad
there
are
not
more
examples
of
this
style
out
there
d
if
you
can
get
over
the
taste
and
smell
this
would
probably
be
fairly
drinkable
this
acidic
character
asserts
itself
more
when
i
take
a
sip
dry
wheaty
with
a
lemony
zing
at
the
finish
body
is
light
crisp
and
occasionally
a
tad
foamy
but
just
about
perfect
for
conveying
the
unique
blend
of
flavors
this
is
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
i
imagine
it
would
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
a
hefeweizen
as
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
day
ill
definitely
be
buying
more
of
this
overall
i
tried
this
beer
the
day
after
visiting
ohne
bedenken
the
other
gosebrauerei
in
leipzig
its
hard
not
to
compare
the
two
and
if
you
were
to
place
the
beers
on
a
spectrum
with
berliner
weisse
being
on
one
end
and
hefeweizen
being
on
the
other
this
was
definitely
on
the
hefeweizen
side
while
ohne
bedenken
was
on
the
berliner
weisse
side
between
the
lactic
acid
salt
and
coriander
this
is
definitely
a
more
complex
beer
than
a
hefeweizen
but
it
is
similar
in
its
refreshing
character
if
youve
never
had
a
gose
before
try
this
one
before
ohne
bedenken
as
it
is
more
toneddown
that
being
said
once
youve
had
gose
this
one
may
come
off
as
a
bit
too
pedestrian
compared
to
its
counterpart
at
ohne
bedenken
of
course
if
youre
in
the
u
s
this
is
likely
to
be
the
only
exemplar
of
the
style
you
can
find
and
i
would
strongly
advise
you
to
give
it
a
try
a
wonderful
style
for
anyone
who
loves
the
variety
of
beer
d
really
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
one
other
than
a
vague
recommendation
that
it
would
be
kinda
like
a
berlinerweisse
well
liking
that
style
a
good
deal
boded
weel
for
this
gose
and
it
did
not
disappoint
quite
tasty
amazingly
easy
to
drink
gone
in
5
or
6
sizable
sips
this
is
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
will
recommend
and
will
look
forward
to
having
again
overall
a
good
brew
i
had
wanted
to
try
this
because
i
love
new
styles
and
this
was
apparently
the
only
one
in
its
style
that
struck
me
as
odd
so
i
have
been
actively
seeking
it
out
i
am
now
very
glad
that
i
did
because
it
was
a
wonderful
light
brew
that
really
brought
a
little
something
different
to
the
table
i
would
easily
buy
it
if
i
ever
saw
it
in
a
store
it
was
just
that
good
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
it
should
not
disappoint
was
pleased
to
see
an
example
of
this
style
available
at
a
store
near
me
pours
a
somewhat
murky
orange
coloration
with
white
heading
that
holds
up
well
smell
has
some
light
fruit
and
a
somewhat
metallic
quality
to
it
taste
starts
off
with
a
bit
of
tartness
followed
by
a
wheat
presence
and
then
ending
with
a
metallic
twang
reminds
me
somewhat
of
how
some
white
wines
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
a
brew
that
grows
on
you
bit
by
bit
with
each
sip
an
interesting
german
ale
one
that
i
might
not
drink
all
the
time
but
one
that
i
am
sure
i
will
visit
again
cheers
seems
pleasing
enough
to
consume
but
not
sure
ill
be
back

am

almost
like

one
that

and
surprising

wonderful
indeed
once
this

was
poured
and
tasted
everyone
was
asking
for
a
second
taste
and
soon
the
supply
was
gone
faster
than

agreed
this

was
great

know

this

ive

for
the

stylistically
that
being

very
cool

id
gladly
pick
up
again
cheers

i
could
session
this
for
sure
an
odd

actually
a
pretty
good
beer
certainly
worth
a

if
you
can
find
it
this

would
be
well

on

if
only
there
were

overall
enjoyable
i

i
would
enjoy

similar
to

maybe
some
unibroue
a
funky
unique
beer
that
takes
a
little
getting
used
to
but
grows
on
you
after
a
while
glad
to
have
tried
it
halfliter
german
bottle
brought
home
from
the
capital
ale
house
in
richmond
brewed
with
coriander
and
salt

pouring
the

with

quicklyrising
carbonation
leading
up
to
a

that
reduces
to
a
quarter
inch
and
leaves
decent

i
smell
papaya
or
mango
at
first
surprisingly
tropical
i
thought
although
it
is
my
first
gose
but
i
also
discover
notes
of
tart
or
nutty
wheat
and
light
hops
it
is
quite
mild
on
the
palate
almost
watery
but
definitely
unique
with
light
oxidation
paper
or
cardboard
some
tartness
a
mild
bitterness
and
hints
of
peppery
coriander
and
salt
on
top
of
a
light
tingly
body
that
leaves
a
fleeting
finish
definitely
an
interesting
style
but
i
wish
the
flavors
were
more
pronounced
as
the
wheat
was
light
and
i
could
barely
taste
the
spices
but
this
perhaps
increases
the
drinkability
im
glad
i
got
to
experience
this
my
85th
style
but
this
offering
seems
to
lack
substance
with
the
flavors
not
really
coming
together
nor
the
saltcoriander
combo
stepping
forward
enough
to
express
themselves
body
and
mouthfeel
are
both
light
and
airy
mouthfeel
is
almost
fluffy
with
a
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
drinkability
the
750
disappears
quickly
due
to
the
low
abv
of
4
6
the
worlds
most
expensive
lawnmower
beer
gald
i
tried
it
but
wont
be
back
i
like
salt
just
not
in
my
beer
this
is
one
of
those
struggles
where
the
brewer
did
exactly
what
they
intended
so
i
read
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
my
taste
drinks
okay
this
minus
the
cardboardy
taste
is
pretty
much
how
i
rember
this
tasting
the
one
time
i
had
this
in
germany
worth
a
try
not
to
my
tastes
im
never
really
impressed
with
most
rustic
biers
unless
they
are
loaded
with
heft
flavor
this
is
what
it
is
my
first
and
only
gose
beer
purchased
from
whole
foods
for
3
the
beer
was
completely
translucent
hazy
orange
with
almost
no
head
the
aroma
was
sour
and
hinted
at
wheat
the
flavor
was
odd
but
good
the
bottle
states
its
brewed
with
coriander
and
salt
i
didnt
detect
either
nice
to
have
tried
but
now
i
must
move
on
md
the
beer
this
style
is
incredibly
drinkable
a
smooth
and
easy
flavor
combined
with
a
lowish
abv
lead
to
that
you
could
easily
make
this
a
session
beer
hazy
orange
bodywith
a
ncie
cream
head
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
spices
yeasty
tasting
with
some
orange
and
other
fruits
didnt
mix
well
with
the
other
beers
i
tried
that
night
worth
picking
up
some
more
at
least
of
the
style
d
outstanding
this
may
be
a
favorite
sessioner
i
hope
that
more
breweries
start
brewing
this
style
i
love
it
murky
light
brown
color
slight
orange
hue
small
very
slight
off
white
head
smells
a
tad
like
sea
air
to
me
with
a
slight
honey
note
the
taste
is
like
a
very
watered
down
butterscotch
with
honey
tiny
little
bit
of
maple
syrup
but
not
much
finishes
clean
decent
mouthfeel
with
a
tiny
bit
of
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
quite
refreshing
seemed
to
go
nicely
with
the
sausage
cheese
and
crackers
i
was
eating
pours
hazy
gold
with
limited
yeasty
cloudiness
and
a
sea
foam
head
that
sticks
to
the
beer
and
the
glass
like
glue
aromas
of
sharp
coriander
wheats
and
yes
just
a
touch
of
saltiness
smells
like
a
belgian
witbier
with
a
sharper
edge
sharp
spiciness
full
carbonation
then
turning
sour
with
lemony
citrus
notes
and
thats
about
it
not
too
much
depth
here
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
that
are
here
are
unique
refreshing
acidic
mouthfeel
that
leaves
the
palate
refreshed
easy
to
drink
with
a
low
abv
as
well
very
interesting
unique
beer
not
sure
if
its
stupendous
enough
to
justify
the
price
unfortunately
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
beer
has
a
huge
bright
white
head
with
some
lace
there
is
a
light
fruity
peach
like
aroma
with
a
spicey
background
and
a
hint
of
corn
the
head
had
a
distinct
salty
taste
that
preceded
the
beer
taste
some
albeit
a
light
version
of
the
usual
flavors
clove
and
banana
notes
but
the
acidic
body
ends
up
dominating
the
flavor
different
nice
not
fabulous
this
was
my
first
gose
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
and
i
have
no
idea
how
old
this
particular
bottle
of
beer
was
it
poured
a
cloudly
brown
similar
to
an
altstyle
beer
with
a
pure
white
head
about
half
an
inch
thick
the
initial
taste
was
strange
and
a
bit
unpleasant
the
saltiness
of
the
beer
created
a
bicarbonate
like
flavor
punctuated
in
the
middle
by
a
dull
metallic
taste
not
a
good
start
a
strange
thing
happened
as
i
was
drinking
this
beer
the
taste
steadily
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
it
lost
its
metallic
taste
and
flavors
other
than
the
salt
became
noticable
by
the
time
i
finished
i
was
sorry
to
see
it
go
im
definately
going
to
give
this
style
another
try
the
next
time
i
find
it
this
is
an
interesting
style
for
sure
and
im
pretty
sure
i
like
it
taste
is
mostly
coriander
but
its
not
dominated
by
it
the
wheat
malt
taste
is
there
in
full
force
while
light
hints
of
bananas
also
make
an
appearance
accompanied
by
a
slight
sour
lemony
flavor
theres
a
unique
bite
of
salt
at
the
end
interesting
beer
and
very
cool
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
goes
down
almost
too
easily
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
quite
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
drinking
buckets
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
style
that
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
explored
a
bit
more
often
track
yourself
down
some
of
this
and
give
it
a
shot
poured
into
a
weihenstephan
weizen
glass
slightly
hazy
dark
yellow
touched
by
brown
large
and
lazy
particles
float
about
a
fairly
strong
pour
doesnt
raise
much
of
a
head
perhaps
2
fingers
at
max
it
quickly
recedes
to
a
glass
ring
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
but
suds
instead
slide
down
the
glass
leaving
a
ring
at
the
original
beer
level
has
an
aroma
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
very
fruity
in
the
nose
also
very
sweet
and
slightly
flowery
maybe
has
a
hint
of
wheat
twang
first
sip
like
taking
a
draught
of
beer
after
coming
from
a
swim
at
the
shore
with
spray
still
fresh
on
your
lips
the
salt
is
quite
a
shock
for
the
uninitiated
its
hard
for
me
to
get
a
handle
on
the
other
flavors
since
the
salt
takes
over
once
it
hits
the
back
of
your
mouth
this
is
a
very
sweet
and
smooth
wheat
ale
it
seems
not
too
much
wheat
twang
either
i
think
the
salt
might
be
unsettling
my
stomach
i
will
attempt
to
review
this
for
the
style
and
that
demands
salt
but
i
dont
much
like
it
so
i
will
take
away
points
here
this
might
be
a
real
nice
drinker
without
the
salt
the
mouthfeel
is
made
of
a
fairly
full
body
but
with
low
carbonation
it
lends
it
a
smooth
mouthfeel
again
drinkability
suffers
because
i
dont
much
like
this
but
i
will
try
to
seek
the
other
gose
listed
to
see
how
it
compares
drinkability
a
low
abv
and
firm
spicy
flavor
make
this
beer
a
winner
a
curious
drink
something
a
bit
unique
but
nothing
that
i
personally
was
impressed
with
or
that
i
was
particularly
craving
more
of
when
i
was
finished
an
interesting
style
and
good
beer
another
good
summer
quencher
alla
berliner
weissebier
but
not
nearly
as
tart
and
more
robust
balanced
flavors
mineral
salts
and
coriander
like
seltzer
and
a
quebec
style
spiced
beer
really
woke
up
the
taste
buds
and
went
with

drinkability
this
is
interesting
and
kind
of
refreshing
in
an
odd
way
but
its
not
something
id
like
to
drink
every
night
might
be
an
interesting
beer
to
pair
with
pork
or
cook
bratwurst
wow
unimpressive
looking
and
smelling
but
what
a
drinker
definitely
going
to
check
this
out
with
bbq
parties
this
summer
it
would
go
great
by
the
pool
with
some
steamers
and
roasted
veggies
the
salinity
works
for
me
like
the
sourness
of
belgian
beers
works
for
me
expectations
were
low
after
a
friend
described
it
as
a
salt
beer
that
he
was
not
impressed
with
so
the
saisonlooking
beer
was
neither
a
surprise
nor
a
certainty
the
aromas
show
a
light
belgian
sourness
that
remained
thin
and
lightly
pungent
tastes
much
less
salty
than
i
expected
though
noticably
salted
the
dominant
flavors
were
lemon
and
orange
rinds
with
a
belgin
souness
tartness
almost
like
a
light
unblended
lambic
quality
a
little
vineous
musk
herbal
character
persists
flavors
never
dominate
and
whisp
away
quite
airy
and
cleanly
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
even
though
i
didnt
have
many
expectations
nevertheless
a
very
clean
beer
a
very
nice
german
beer
i
will
add
leipzig
on
the
list
of
places
to
visit
next
trip
to
europe
will
an
american
brewer
dare
try
to
brew
a
gose
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
very
good
one
either
similar
to
an
undercarbonated
wit
mouthefeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
light
body
the
carbonation
gives
the
beer
a
good
all
around
lift
the
beer
has
a
pretty
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
sessionable
beer
a
very
good
drinking
beer
wow
very
surprising
why
there
isnt
more
of
this
around
i
dont
know
its
really
very
good
get
some
if
you
can
verdict
this
is
a
great
small
beer
the
abv
is
only
4
6
but
it
never
feels
light
on
body
or
flavor
its
a
sublime
effortlessly
drinkable
brew
drinkability
overall
a
good
beer
and
a
interesting
style
that
im
glad
i
tried
at
least
once
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
i
really
dont
care

overall
i
could
say
that
this
would
be
my
goto
beer
for
those
hot
summer
days
were
it
not
so
darn
hard
to
find
and
just
a
bit
above
my
threshold
for
session
beers
as
far
as
price
is
concerned
nevertheless
i
could
easily
drink
a
bunch
of
this
beer
in
a
session
with
no
problems
at
all
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
makes
me
happy
to
advocate
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
lightly
carbonated
this
is
my
first
gose
not
that
the
world
is
crawling
with
them
so
i
wasnt
entirely
sure
what
to
expect
i
did
however
expect
something
more
aggressive
with
respect
to
both
coriander
and
salt
its
my
understanding
that
this
is
another
one
of
those
odd
german
beers
to
which
people
occasionally
add
flavored
and
colored
syrups
if
i
was
in
charge
at
gasthaus
gosebrauerei
id
eliminate
the
need
to
add
anything
to
the
beer
by
simply
making
it
goser
pours
a
light
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
little
lacing
behind
it
has
a
dark
brown
to
gold
appearance
that
looks
fairly
clear
and
crisp
the
smell
reminds
me
of
as
sweet
bock
bier
its
very
fruity
like
apple
and
berry
coupled
with
a
hoppy
smell
this
bier
is
salty
the
first
bier
i
have
ever
had
that
is
bitter
and
salty
slightly
spiced
with
salty
flavors
and
hops
drinkability
extraordinary
and
unusual
has
some
similarities
to
a
witbier
but
much
more
interesting
this
gose
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
persisted
a
while
but
slowly
settled
leaving
a
film
coating
the
glass
the
smell
was
floral
with
a
touch
of
coriander
and
a
light
malt
aroma
the
taste
was
lightly
sour
with
the
flavor
of
wheat
malt
and
coriander
very
much
like
a
witbier
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
with
light
body
and
good
carbonation
the
lightly
tart
taste
lingered
this
was
a
very
refreshing
brew
though
it
seems
to
taste
slightly
differently
each
time
i
have
it
proabably
a
delicate
beer
beer
is
good
happy
brackish
beering
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
could
easily
be
a
staple
not
horribly
expensive
for
an
import
and
very
good
beer
for
the
price
got
this
one
from
my
father
who
paid
3
99
great
beer
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
billowing
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
banana
and
coriander
like
a
really
big
witbier
the
taste
is
of
banana
and
coriander
it
walks
the
fine
line
of
being
mellow
while
still
being
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
lighter
the
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
is
sad
that
this
style
is
so
overlooked
by
american
brewers
my
first
gose
poured
out
to
a
slightly
hazy
brass
color
with
a
tiny
bubbled
white
foam
head
medium
high
level
of
carbonation
some
notes
of
lace
were
present
aroma
of
sea
salt
wheat
and
grain
and
sweet
bread
taste
was
quite
light
and
mild
with
overtones
of
mild
orange
grain
and
malt
some
traces
of
yeast
and
corn
slight
tartness
toward
the
finish
and
overall
rather
dry
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
far
from
special
carbonation
lit
the
tastbuds
up
with
hints
of
flavor
that
never
really
made
it
to
fruition
average
drinkability
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
reminded
more
of
a
well
made
american
macro
worth
a
try
overall
wow
this
is
different
from
anything
ive
ever
had
its
got
some
nice
muted
weizen
characteristics
and
incorporates
them
beautifully
in
with
the
little
spicy
saltiness
drinkability
easily
the
best
i
have
had
from
the
style
and
the
worst
poured
off
the
tap
at
dilly
deli
in
cincinnati
as
a
hefty
sampler
poured
a
beautiful
pale
yellow
that
was
slightly
hazy
but
had
a
tremendous
thick
white
head
that
lasted
forever
wheaty
aroma
with
some
twang
in
the
background
the
flavor
begins
with
strong
wheat
with
some
yeasty
coriander
finishes
with
tartness
from
the
addition
of
the
lactic
acid
didnt
really
get
the
salt
profile
that
i
read
about
but
there
were
some
citrus
hints
as
well
a
lot
more
heavy
on
the
mouth
than
expected
from
the
looks
of
it
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
style
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
has
a
bite
to
it
surprisingly
quite
full
in
body
i
am
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
but
it
lacks
the
high
drinkability
of
most
wheat
beers
thus
this
beer
seems
to
be
lacking
its
place
in
my
beer
food
pyramid
the
mouth
has
the
feel
of
a
good
pale
wheat
but
with
a
little
kick
from
the
saltspiceherb
combo
that
is
accented
by
the
carbonation
this
has
session
beer
written
all
over
it
i
didnt
what
to
think
with
a
beer
whose
ingredients
include
coriander
and
salt
but
was
i
surprised
by
this
gose
poured
to
a
nice
amber
colored
with
a
fizzy
head
that
vanished
in
a
instant
a
nice
spicey
nose
with
a
hint
of
wheat
at
first
taste
you
get
hit
with
the
spices
and
the
salt
comes
in
on
thru
the
backdoor
it
was
like
coming
out
of
the
ocean
and
getting
a
mouthfull
of
sea
water
but
have
no
fear
the
salt
taste
goes
away
within
seconds
overall
an
awesome
beer
and
certainly
one
to
try
wow
this
was
a
real
summer
quencher
poured
hazy
sunshine
yellow
from
the
tall
porcelain
stoppered
flasche
aroma
was
fruity
and
lemony
with
hints
of
spice
and
floral
notes
head
was
creamy
white
and
lingered
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
glass
taste
was
acidic
even
lemony
hints
of
spice
and
traces
of
saltiness
that
this
style
is
noted
for
having
an
overriding
sour
taste
was
just
the
thing
to
take
the
edge
off
of
a
hazy
hot
and
humid
saturday
drinkability
was
good
if
you
want
something
light
and
goes
down
easy
very
drinkable
brew
i
cant
understand
why
it
isnt
made
by
more
breweries
hard
to
describe
think
of
wheat
beer
gatorade
i
would
consider
this
for
everyday
use
if
only
an
american
brewery
made
it
alaskan
brewing
has
shown
mastery
at
making
altbier
maybe
they
should
try
gose
im
pretty
sure
i
reviewed
this
one
at
one
point
but
apparantly
im
mistaken
this
is
a
rare
beer
as
only
a
handful
of
breweries
in
one
region
of
german
even
make
it
anymore
anyway
its
now
widely
available
in
the
states
and
although
it
is
quite
pricey
ir
is
definately
a
nice
taste
experience
this
is
a
light
gold
offwhite
brew
with
a
big
head
of
white
foam
that
dies
quickly
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
on
my
glass
aromas
are
all
coriander
and
citrus
just
like
a
classic
wit
or
wheat
but
it
is
spicy
as
well
and
it
does
not
have
a
strong
hefey
sort
of
flavor
to
it
taste
is
saltysour
and
spicy
with
the
nice
wit
notes
in
the
mix
as
well
no
real
fruity
banana
or
german
yeasty
esters
show
their
head
though
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
the
finish
is
dry
drinkability
is
pretty
nice
a
real
oneofakind
brew
that
i
quite
like
but
dont
drink
often
it
will
be
cool
to
sup
this
one
in
germany
at
the
source
soon
tasted
at
a
homebrew
club
meeting
interesting
the
salt
coriander
and
wheat
are
indeed
all
in
there
kind
of
horsey
and
sour
with
a
definite
lactic
quality
i
guess
its
a
beer
thats
exactly
as
advertised
salt
gives
it
a
softened
water
taste
then
it
finishes
with
a
little
sweetness
not
to
my
personal
taste
but
a
pleasure
to
have
discovered
this
very
interesting
style
havent
had
anything
like
it
before
still
trying
to
wrap
my
mind
around
it
certainly
worth
a
try
i
liked
the
look
of
it
and
the
taste
of
it
but
never
came
to
an
agreeement
with
the
smell
of
it
still
i
will
certainly
try
this
again
with
the
expectation
that
theres
more
to
appreciate
halfaliter
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
present
the
smell
is
fruity
and
salty
a
weird
combo
orange
peel
mixed
with
sea
salt
comes
to
mind
the
taste
has
lots
of
citrus
as
well
lime
and
orange
take
over
with
some
saltiness
on
the
finish
even
a
little
peppery
spice
the
body
is
fairly
thick
and
strong
the
drinkability
is
good
too
thanks
to
kev
for
introducing
me
to
this
style
of
beer
fruity
nose
with
corriander
very
reminescent
of
a
wit
style
aroma
although
a
bit
under
played
on
the
some
of
the
spice
good
mouthfeel
nice
refreshing
wheat
character
mixed
style
sort
of
cross
between
a
hefe
and
wit
clean
aftertaste
with
just
a
hint
of
sourness
in
the
finish
a
salt
beer
hmm
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
sour
with
something
else
that
gives
it
a
sharp
edge
the
flavor
has
a
citrus
thing
going
on
but
then
has
a
strange
salty
drying
sensation
at
the
end
light
body
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
much
just
not
my
thing
drinkability
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
so
easy
to
drink
and
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
i
have
had
the
price
was
a
bit
steep
4
50
i
think
but
it
was
worth
it
im
wishing
i
snagged
another
couple
of
these
damn
nice
3
finger
head
that
falls
slowly
to
a
very
healthy
coat
hazy
orange
color
nose
is
pretty
nice
a
lot
going
on
in
there
i
get
lemonspritzed
banans
most
prevalent
the
flavor
is
still
not
as
impressive
as
i
would
hope
i
get
a
saltyness
initially
moving
to
a
grainey
flavor
but
not
harsh
and
finishing
a
light
fig
or
raisin
the
feel
is
a
solid
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
a
little
better
than
i
gave
it
before
it
is
a
well
rounded
beer
id
get
it
when
looking
for
something
different
bumping
it
to
a
solid
4
all
around
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
under
a
thick
one
finger
white
head
that
has
lots
of
body
but
doesnt
stay
very
long
a
few
spots
and
strings
of
lace
cling
to
the
glass
distinct
spicey
nose
with
the
coriander
mixing
pleasantly
with
the
citrus
of
a
usual
german
weizen
the
mouth
is
highly
carbonated
and
fairly
light
there
is
a
definite
tanginess
here
like
a
weizen
but
somehow
sweeter
the
coriander
is
not
overpowering
but
is
definitely
present
there
is
a
slight
saltiness
in
the
finish
rather
like
mild
perspiration
the
sweet
fruitiness
is
a
touch
like
lemonade
or
perhaps
a
berliner
weisse
certainly
an
interesting
brew
although
i
cant
say
i
would
want
more
than
one
glass
under
most
circumstances
i
feel
fortunate
to
say
that
there
are
about
3
stores
within
ten
minutes
of
me
that
carry
this
on
a
regular
basis
let
me
rephrase
it
is
probably
never
restocked
since
its
first
shipment
the
bottle
has
a
jovial
german
man
who
seems
to
be
happy
about
something
this
poured
out
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
nice
sticky
head
forming
right
away
there
was
a
good
amount
of
spontaneous
carbonation
running
all
through
the
glass
the
aroma
was
delicate
and
floral
doughy
presence
small
traces
of
spices
popped
through
as
well
the
taste
is
definately
different
than
anything
i
have
had
before
i
wouldt
say
it
is
an
unfamiliar
taste
in
the
sense
of
other
wiezen
styles
but
the
saltiness
is
an
unfamiliar
touch
apparently
the
use
of
salt
in
this
style
of
beer
traces
back
to
some
real
oldschool
brewing
practices
that
are
not
so
common
anymore
the
salt
aspect
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
is
much
more
subtle
than
table
salt
but
it
lingers
enough
to
know
it
is
major
piece
of
this
brew
the
salt
and
corriander
leave
my
mouth
very
dry
but
refeshed
i
can
say
that
this
not
a
style
of
beer
that
i
am
crazy
about
but
it
is
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
feel
honored
to
have
tried
this
is
true
oldschool
german
brewing
a
really
unique
beer
which
always
scores
points
in
my
book
pours
a
light
yellow
orange
amber
color
with
a
poofy
white
head
smells
spicy
and
dusty
those
scents
are
even
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
which
is
pretty
complex
nice
herbal
hop
taste
with
lots
of
complex
spicy
backgrounds
the
use
of
corriander
and
salt
is
definately
apparent
and
in
my
opinion
pretty
interesting
this
beer
also
has
a
pretty
apparent
funky
taste
as
found
in
belgian
styles
a
good
surprise
i
wasnt
expecting
really
nice
and
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
this
beer
particularly
refreshing
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
if
you
want
something
out
of
the
ordinary
go
pick
up
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
the
dude
on
the
front
of
the
bottle
looks
like
hes
having
a
blast
d
this
is
a
very
unique
smooth
beer
it
has
a
good
pale
malt
taste
with
a
nice
spicy
finish
very
nice
for
a
summer
quafting
beer
nothing
to
shock
the
tastebuds
but
a
good
solid
beer
very
cloudy
amber
nice
color
gentle
1cm
white
head
no
carbonation
apparent
wild
aroma
salty
hops
with
a
little
matchstick
faint
malt
and
lemony
hints
a
bit
empty
bodywise
it
tastes
rather
meaty
vegetal
mineral
all
over
a
tart
background
a
bit
like
sour
bread
and
rhubarb
sour
and
salty
aint
no
friends
light
body
light
carbonation
bleh
hopefully
the
other
gose
defends
this
style
better
because
this
one
is
one
of
those
select
few
that
deserves
twice
more
points
for
the
appearance
than
taste
this
is
a
beautiful
thing
5
liter
bottle
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
brown
color
the
large
foamy
head
lasts
a
long
time
and
there
are
nice
clumps
of
lace
on
the
side
of
my
5
liter
weissbier
glass
the
aroma
is
fruit
lemon
and
apple
yeast
spices
and
a
little
funk
the
flavor
is
fruity
much
like
tart
apples
there
is
a
malty
wheat
flavor
and
little
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
the
balance
comes
from
the
salt
there
is
a
coriandor
flavor
but
it
is
not
as
strong
as
in
many
spiced
belgian
beers
very
crisp
and
refreshing
this
beer
tasted
weird
to
me
at
first
but
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
loved
it
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
the
time
this
is
only
the
2nd
bottle
ive
had
of
this
very
distinctive
beer
bought
off
the
internet
as
its
not
distributed
here
the
first
time
a
couple
years
back
i
thought
i
tasted
the
salt
a
lot
more
than
i
do
now
i
think
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
with
some
semisoft
cheeses
like
chimays
wonderful
cheeses
lightmedium
bodied
i
was
a
bit
at
a
loss
as
i
had
no
experience
to
compare
this
one
against
slight
cloudymurky
light
orange
in
color
strings
of
carbonation
rise
to
the
top
a
thin
active
head
has
a
very
odd
but
receptive
nose
of
salt
coriander
and
some
outdoor
type
freshness
massive
twang
in
the
palate
sharp
wheaty
and
malt
offerings
up
front
lemon
zestiness
similar
to
hefes
but
more
crisp
and
flavorful
maintains
a
decent
medium
body
coriander
and
some
metallic
tastings
stays
the
same
even
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
and
beyond
finish
is
slightly
tarty
crisp
and
creamy
what
a
superb
brew
oh
so
easy
to
quaff
and
oh
so
tasty
heres
to
you
heres
to
me
go
get
the
gose
edit
i
found
out
that
it
is
from
e
germany
after
my
guess
there
must
be
a
ton
of
beers
from
east
germany
that
are
excellent
but
very
difficult
to
obtain
in
the
us
even
to
this
day
clear
copperygold
in
hue
there
is
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
racing
towards
the
white
head
in
a
variation
of
a
pilsner
glass
the
head
reached
an
apex
of
two
very
bubbly
fingers
the
head
retention
was
very
good
it
took
awhile
before
it
started
to
fade
it
still
had
good
height
and
a
tight
cap
lasted
the
entire
consumption
while
the
color
is
ordinary
the
big
rocky
head
makes
this
a
lovely
looking
beer
subsequent
lacing
was
patchy
the
nose
is
airy
but
not
empty
the
main
fragrance
while
lacking
in
potency
is
obviously
spicysalty
with
a
sharp
earthy
twang
at
the
back
lemony
notes
too
some
brief
hints
of
metal
the
nose
doesnt
say
much
beyond
this
however
while
i
cant
describe
the
smell
it
does
trigger
my
mind
to
think
hops

even
though
the
potency
is
lacking
the
constant
repeated
whisper
is
unique
the
bouquet
is
more
intriguing
than
inviting
regardless
it
is
drinking
time
the
palate
is
amazingly
refreshing
it
took
about
four
sips
before
i
anointed
this
the
most
refreshing
beer
i
have
ever
had
move
over
dortmunder
hefeweizen
or
pale
ale
gose
has
won
my
heart
the
flavors
are
crisp
and
to
the
point
only
the
earthiness
is
wide
and
found
throughout
upfront
is
a
mild
blast
of
saltyspice
and
lemony
flavors
in
the
middle
was
a
sweetsaltiness
that
made
my
mouth
water
interestingly
by
the
finish
the
beer
turned
dry
while
this
beer
is
largely
clean
there
is
an
odd
but
enduring
aftertaste
it
is
sweet
earthy
but
salty
tart
all
mixed
in
one
sensation
im
impressed
i
can
easily
see
why
some
would
not
enjoy
this
beer
it
strikes
some
very
unique
cords
they
just
happen
to
the
correct
notes
with
me
the
relatively
lively
carbonation
works
perfectly
with
the
flavor
profile
not
to
mention
the
low
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
mediummediumlight
in
body
but
it
is
perfect
for
this
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
could
session
with
this
beer
effortlessly
i
found
it
quirky
and
fun
of
course
finding
more
bottles
might
be
a
chore
i
bought
my
sample
in
burnsville
mn
for
4
19
i
really
dug
it
and
i
cant
imagine
how
wonderful
this
would
be
fresh
recommended
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
deep
hues
of
dark
amber
colors
throughout
a
firm
white
head
about
an
inch
high
forms
and
laces
the
glass
quiet
nicely
aromas
are
a
bit
spicy
with
a
slight
coriander
and
peppery
notes
but
then
move
to
more
wheaty
lemony
citrus
like
aromas
smells
pretty
damn
good
initially
this
beer
hits
up
front
with
a
nice
wheaty
like
flavor
that
quickly
moves
towards
a
more
citrus
lemony
flavor
in
the
middle
there
is
a
dry
briney
sort
of
flavor
with
just
the
slightest
hint
of
salt
which
just
tingles
on
the
tongue
because
of
the
delightful
carbonation
there
a
nice
yeastie
like
flavor
that
also
makes
its
way
into
the
mix
this
beer
finishes
sweet
and
zesty
with
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
and
just
a
bit
of
spice
that
leaves
the
tongue
just
wondering
what
the
hell
happened
here
of
course
in
a
good
way
that
is
this
beer
is
delitefully
light
bodied
with
a
zesty
sort
of
carbonation
that
just
feels
great
on
the
pallate
overall
this
beer
and
its
style
is
fantastic
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
some
of
the
other
beers
ive
been
trying
lately
pours
a
clear
copper
color
it
is
well
carbonated
which
supports
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
grainwheat
with
notes
of
lemon
and
some
light
spice
notes
to
me
this
has
a
clean
appetizing
aroma
the
beer
is
sweet
up
front
with
a
lightly
sour
finish
the
sourness
seems
to
be
both
a
combination
of
the
wheat
used
and
the
yeast
bugs
used
though
it
is
quite
light
and
in
almost
not
there
when
compared
to
some
of
the
other
sour
beers
of
the
world
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
a
perfect
beer
for
this
hot
july
night
there
almost
seems
to
be
a
smoky
note
in
the
finish
perhaps
this
is
all
that
is
left
of
the
coriander
the
beer
itself
is
nondescriptly
spicy
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
light
beer
is
showing
its
age
a
bit
while
still
quite
enjoyable
it
was
not
as
pronounced
in
its
uniqueness
as
the
brewing
process
would
suggest
nice
quite
salty
spicy
and
citric
some
cloves
lightly
tart
and
acidic
mouthcovering
palate
while
not
being
to
heavy
left
me
wanting
more
after
every
sip
nice
dry
light
yet
palate
covering
everything
seemed
to
be
in
its
right
place
cool
bottle
too
great
beer
thanks
per
ill
be
honest
i
was
a
little
scared
about
the
salt
part
of
this
beer
but
this
was
pretty
good
poured
out
a
dark
orangegolden
color
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
a
good
quarter
inch
stays
with
you
the
entire
time
smell
consisted
of
coriander
mostly
but
cloves
and
soft
fruit
was
in
there
as
well
which
mellowed
out
the
sharp
coriander
taste
was
half
wittehalf
hefe
the
cloves
and
coriander
blend
in
together
and
the
banana
flavors
balance
it
out
and
then
the
salt
hits
in
the
aftertaste
but
its
quite
pleasent
it
finishes
wet
in
a
way
but
the
salt
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
and
more
which
i
was
amazed
on
how
it
did
that
to
me
so
gose
it
is
pick
some
of
this
stuff
up
a
good
shake
up
for
the
summer
months
instead
of
all
those
wittes
and
hefes
doesnt
this
beer
break
some
kind
of
purity
law
or
something
the
story
of
liepzigs
ghost
beer
coming
back
from
the
dead
is
probably
more
interesting
than
the
beer
itself
although
its
subtle
tartness
and
dryness
from
the
addition
of
salt
do
give
it
a
really
unique
refreshing
quality
it
pours
easily
enough
giving
rise
to
a
full
head
of
thin
creamy
white
lace
that
holds
exceptionally
well
and
leaves
thick
longlasting
rings
of
lace
about
the
glass
very
fine
effervescent
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
quickly
to
the
surface
and
it
basically
resembles
any
wellmade
hefeweizen
coriander
is
evident
in
the
nose
along
with
a
touch
of
weizentype
yeast
characteristic
apple
and
subtle
phenolics
in
the
mouth
its
tiny
bubbles
lend
a
gentle
caresses
as
its
light
body
passes
smoothly
away
with
a
delicate
creaminess
wheat
malt
appears
first
on
the
palate
followed
by
some
dark
fruitiness
similar
to
that
of
a
hefeweizen
but
theres
no
banana
except
for
a
very
soft
note
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
splash
of
tartness
followed
by
a
mild
coriander
flavor
and
some
herbal
hops
at
the
swallow
seemingly
out
of
nowhere
salt
springs
forth
drying
tangy
and
oddly
refreshing
its
not
as
bold
in
flavor
as
a
traditional
bavarian
hefeweizen
but
its
unique
characteristics
lesssweet
flavor
and
slightly
lower
alcohol
may
give
it
a
bit
more
drinkability
if
you
like
hefeweizens
and
tart
or
lightly
tart
beers
then
this
is
a
must
try
unusual
and
very
enjoyable
a
beer
to
do
interesting
food
pairing
experiments
with
looks
like
homeade
ginger
beer
with
its
refreshing
hazy
caramel
orange
color
the
beer
pours
a
nice
sponge
like
off
white
head
that
starts
a
t
two
fingers
and
retreats
to
a
solid
one
throughout
the
aromas
are
of
whod
a
thunk
it
spicy
corriander
and
sea
salt
this
begs
for
a
hot
pretzel
with
mustard
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
a
very
refreshing
drink
that
shows
best
quite
cold
an
intriguing
element
of
savory
from
the
salt
adds
local
color
to
the
beer
perhaps
the
salt
is
so
you
keep
on
drinking
brilliant
glass
of
suds
exact
same
bottle
as
in
the
picture
the
bottle
says
brewed
with
coriander
and
salt
delicate
lemony
citrus
notes
are
followed
by
a
strong
spicy
coriander
flavour
this
is
balanced
by
a
pleasant
sour
twang
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
hard
mineral
driven
finish
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
very
unique
interesting
the
beer
came
is
a
0
5
liter
brown
bottle
with
label
that
looked
like
a
blast
from
the
past
the
beer
when
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
displayed
extremely
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
body
that
was
yellow
with
a
cloud
of
brown
yeast
that
would
not
let
any
light
pass
through
i
guess
if
a
hefeweizen
is
cloudy
this
one
is
like
an
oncoming
storm
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
malty
with
some
lambic
like
funkiness
thrown
in
the
taste
is
very
light
with
the
yeast
tasting
very
spicy
with
orange
peel
and
clove
that
overpowered
most
other
flavors
except
a
note
of
sourness
that
reminded
me
of
a
lambic
once
again
i
could
not
really
detect
much
coriander
but
the
salt
was
evident
in
the
way
the
beer
dried
up
my
mouth
after
each
sip
this
is
a
very
unique
taste
that
is
somewhat
of
a
cross
between
a
witbier
and
a
lambic
the
downfall
of
this
beer
is
a
watered
down
empty
mouthfeel
which
is
a
bit
odd
considering
the
body
is
not
very
lightweight
i
picked
up
mine
at
greens
on
cheshire
bridge
road
in
my
opinion
worth
a
try
as
there
is
nothing
else
quite
like
it
notes
not
too
exciting
would
be
nice
on
a
warm
day
theres
just
not
much
depth
and
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
lacking
hazed
deep
golden
appearance
orange
luminates
from
the
beer
as
well
the
one
finger
offwhite
head
has
good
retention
lace
is
droopy
but
decent
enough
aromas
nice
spicy
and
herbal
earthy
malty
the
taste
is
interesting
very
earthy
like
dirt
to
an
extent
has
a
bit
of
a
farmyard
presence
to
it
malts
are
sturdy
enough
hops
add
just
a
little
bitterness
rock
salt
is
sprinkled
on
top
the
carbonation
is
a
little
high
and
the
body
is
about
medium
or
a
little
better
interesting
brew
my
first
gose
not
one
id
need
to
return
to
anytime
soon
though
excellent
drinkability
im
surprised
that
this
style
is
not
more
common
clean
and
light
bodied
enough
to
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting

on
an
unlimited

for
750ml
bottle
from
tulleys
beer
and
wine
wells
me
nothing
here
really
leaps
out
but
there
are
nuamnces
enough
to
keep
your
interest
each
element
carries
a
pleasant
signature
and
they
merge
nicely
into
a
balance
that
yields
a
unique
result
if
it
suits
your
tastes
with
its
spicy
identity
then
its
quite
drinkable
and
i
found
it
just
so
a
year
ago
id
likely
have
turned
up
my
nose
at
this
but
my
preferences
have
shifted
to
the
point
where
i
find
this
something
i
can
truly
enjoy
it
makes
me
wonder
what
new
and
wonderful
changes
another
year
will
bring
pours
a
darkish
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
the
head
looks
like
a
science
experiment
gone
awry
smell
was
hefe
with
a
twist
i
got
apples
bananas
orange
spice
and
ocean
air
the
taste
was
also
unexpectedly
good
it
was
like
a
normal
wheat
beer
with
added
components
the
spices
were
notable
and
made
the
beer
have
a
wit
like
edge
to
it
however
the
salt
was
what
added
the
most
it
added
a
briney
dry
finish
it
was
almost
like
adding
beer
to
your
mouth
while
eating
a
nice
salty
oyster
it
was
refreshing
and
drying
at
the
same
time
mouthfeel
was
nice
went
down
smooth
as
silk
one
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
not
for
the
salt
after
a
couple
i
did
find
the
salt
was
not
making
my
tummy
too
happy
and
later
i
did
feel
a
bit
parched
but
that
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
a
tasty
brew
much
better
than
the
other
gose
i
have
had
drinkability
its
certainly
a
chuggable
beer
ill
give
it
that
sampled
123103
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
great
fluffy
head
that
left
some
light
lacingaroma
is
of
lemons
with
a
hint
of
mineral
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
pretty
acidic
with
that
saltiness
showing
thru
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
wich
was
more
pronounced
than
what
i
thought
it
would
be
a
great
easy
drinker
i
think
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
here
in
carolina
drinking
this
gose
is
much
more
an
experience
about
mouthfeel
and
refreshment
than
taste
and
on
that
simple
level
its
an
enjoyable
brew
perhaps
one
of
the
best
beers
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
but
i
think
my
tastebuds
would
get
bored
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
only
commercial
example
of
gose
available
in
the
us
and
it
is
the
only
one
that
i
have
ever
tried
with
that
said
i
wish
there
were
more
i
would
like
to
see
other
brewers
versions
it
has
a
slight
hazy
copper
color
with
a
large
head
the
aroma
is
delicate
and
subtle
with
aromas
of
citrus
and
spice
the
body
is
smooth
and
thin
there
are
tastes
of
orange
and
it
reminds
me
of
pretzels
from
the
use
of
the
salt
there
is
a
slight
sourness
in
the
refreshing
finish
bring
on
more
gose
the
taste
is
nice
much
like
a
typical
weiss
beer
a
mild
banana
taste
from
the
yeast
but
a
tiny
bit
different
a
little
dry
virtually
no
aftertaste
whatsoever
just
a
bit
of
residual
sweetness
this
is
no
doubt
due
to
the
salt
in
this
brew
very
nice
light
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
great
summer
brew
thanks
to
chaduvel
for
slogging
this
out
to
ut
for
me
pours
a
hazy
mandarin
copper
color
with
a
big
fluffy
creamy
slightly
off
white
head
nice
smell
is
light
orange
with
some
tangy
wheat
notes
coriander
and
yeast
taste
is
smooth
wheat
malt
up
front
that
quickly
gets
tangysour
and
accented
with
coriander
picking
up
lemon
notes
and
there
seems
to
be
a
unique
salty
character
to
it
all
very
interesting
finish
is
wheat
bitter
with
lingering
coriander
and
some
bananay
esters
this
beer
has
a
big
mouthfeel
for
its
strength
and
gets
better
as
it
warms
glad
i
got
to
try
this
drinkability

i
thought
the
salt
was
a
little
overpowering
although
i
guess
it
is
typical
of
the
style
taste
is
grainy
wheat
with
underlying
spice
saltiness
doesnt
come
through
until
later
its
cumulative
the
more
you
drink
the
more
saltiness
on
the
palate
while
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
saltiness
builds
and
makes
this
brew
less
than
drinkable
at
least
more
than
one
bottle
at
a
time
but
a
unique
experience
that
i
would
recommend
and
i
will
indulge
in
again
john
sinec
there
are
only
two
of
this
style
in
the
database
i
figured
theyre
fairly
hard
to
come
by
so
i
snatched
one
up
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
cant
compare
it
to
anything
else
in
the
style
again
as
there
are
only
two
but
this
one
is
different
nonetheless
not
bad
just
different
it
pours
a
cloudy
amber
colour
with
a
lovely
foamy
head
so
far
so
good
the
smell
is
quite
different
a
bit
sweet
a
bit
salty
a
bit
stale
almost
complex
but
strange
the
taste
here
is
also
not
overly
appealing
at
first
but
it
is
quickly
warmed
up
to
and
whilst
not
exceptional
is
solid
just
the
same
theres
a
bit
of
fruitiness
here
but
it
is
peppered
with
salt
if
you
will
just
a
very
strange
style
to
try
to
review
in
all
i
say
go
try
one
and
be
the
judge
yourself
some
will
love
it
others
will
hate
it
i
on
the
other
hand
fell
pretty
much
in
the
middle
on
this
one
id
like
to
sample
the
style
again
to
compare
but
wont
be
breaking
down
any
doors
to
seek
it
out
nice
appearance
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
thick
head
that
had
excellent
retention
and
good
lacing
there
wasnt
much
of
an
aroma
somewhat
like
a
fresh
bag
of
potato
chips
the
taste
was
dry
kinda
salty
with
a
hint
of
the
coriander
the
finish
was
pretty
dry
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
thinking
the
odd
ingredients
would
somehow
be
more
pronounced
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
think
this
was
just
an
above
average
macro
so
it
gose
i
imagine
this
beer
would
go
well
with
foodmaybe
chips
or
cheese
an
interesting
effort
but
probably
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
murky
pale
copper
hue
pitted
frothy
vanilla
white
head
leaves
spotty
sparse
lace
spicy
sharp
clove
and
herbal
coriander
dominate
the
aroma
but
are
offset
by
mellow
ripe
banana
esters
mild
lemony
citric
tartness
slight
papery
oxidation
notes
prevent
vibrancy
pronounced
clove
lends
a
mild
medicinal
note
upfront
grainy
wheat
tartness
comprises
the
dominant
malt
character
and
is
accompanied
by
a
parching
dryness
provided
by
mild
pure
salinity
simple
breezy
banana
esters
provides
token
girth
appropriately
lightly
bittered
due
to
the
paltry
residual
sweetness
musty
nutty
suspended
yeast
undertone
phenol
augments
as
the
beer
breathes
and
approaches
rubbery
in
nature
well
attenuated
with
a
brisk
thinnish
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
lingering
suggestion
of
clove
studded
salted
preserved
lemon
a
strange
brew
with
unbalanced
elements
of
a
wit
and
hefeweizen
maybe
i
just
missed
the
orange
peel
or
the
overt
salinity
overshadowed
it
tasty
but
rough
around
the
edges
id
very
much
like
to
try
more
of
this
obscure
style
cloudy
light
orange
color
looks
like
a
hefeweizen
has
a
huge
creamy
head
that
clings
to
my
glass
aroma
is
that
of
a
hefeweizen
spicy
wheat
smell
taste
like
wheat
and
mild
spice
i
cant
really
taste
coriander
yet
it
is
a
bit
salty
light
bodied
with
a
kind
of
a
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
a
bit
sour
very
drinkable
and
not
bad
but
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
this
again
thanks
lbb
for
something
different
an
intriguing
style
rarely
encountered
and
quite
easy
to
appreciate
if
im
ever
in
the
mood
for
a
mellow
dry
brew
that
wont
go
and
blow
my
mind
gose
it
is
id
wanted
to
try
this
style
of
beer
for
quite
some
time
and
was
pleased
to
finally
get
a
chance
the
appearance
of
the
beer
is
truly
amazing
a
towering
everlasting
rocky
white
head
tops
a
copperycaramel
colored
liquid
the
head
is
phenomenal
very
slight
haze
in
the
beer
coriander
is
distinct
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
mix
of
esters
first
taste
is
at
once
sweet
and
sour
salt
comes
through
in
the
hindtaste
it
becomes
more
pronounced
as
you
drink
more
of
the
beer
causing
a
mouthpuckering
and
unexpected
reaction
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
beer
after
beer
of
this
style
yet
its
strangely
refreshing
highly
recommended
trad
lambics
fan
will
love
it
drinkability
a
pastiche
of
other
more
familiar
beer
styles
a
healthy
dose
of
wit
a
sizable
portion
of
hefe
and
a
dash
of
gueuze
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
similar
etymology
here
a
great
beer
for
food
especially
bratwurst
and
other
german
delicacies
i
suspect
ill
be
having
a
few
of
these
next
summer
during
grilling
season
you
look
at
it
and
youd
just
assume
it
was
a
hefeweizen
if
you
didnt
know
better
the
cloudy
orangedarktan
body
topped
by
a
large
lumpy
longlasting
white
cloud
of
a
head
fill
the
requirements
of
good
looking
hefeweizens
the
aroma
then
throws
you
for
a
loop
that
distinctive
coriander
scent
doesnt
belong
here
if
this
was
a
hefeweizen
plus
its
missing
much
of
the
bananabubblegum
esters
of
a
good
hefeweizen
although
a
slight
phenolic
notes
makes
this
smell
much
like
youd
expect
from
a
witbier
on
the
first
sip
i
noticed
a
sour
twang
that
toned
down
drastically
in
further
sips
the
coriander
makes
for
a
nice
bit
of
character
in
the
flavor
and
the
salt
really
shows
itself
mostly
in
meshing
with
the
backend
bitterness
but
ill
qualify
that
with
the
fact
that
im
a
salt
fiend
so
my
salt
threshhold
may
be
a
little
high
theres
something
missing
though
it
lacks
the
bold
wheatiness
or
the
creamy
mouthfeel
of
a
good
hefeweizen
its
still
a
very
unique
drinkable
beer
gose
pours
with
a
large
bubbly
head
requiring
a
slow
pour
in
order
to
control
it
the
head
is
fairly
sticky
and
piles
pretty
high
above
the
rim
of
the
glass
when
it
finally
recedes
it
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
forms
a
thick
lace
that
stays
for
the
life
of
the
glass
theres
a
great
aroma
and
lots
of
it
the
aroma
is
citrusy
with
lots
of
lemony
notes
as
well
as
some
yeast
and
slight
spice
notes
cant
really
smell
any
salt
that
is
typically
mentioned
with
the
style
the
color
is
a
nice
slightly
hazy
amber
the
start
is
slightly
smooth
but
the
tartness
kicks
in
quickly
with
carbonation
that
adds
some
additional
bite
malts
add
some
graininess
to
this
brew
and
are
subtle
throughout
this
brew
along
with
the
tart
up
front
palate
are
citrus
notes
namely
lemon
spice
notes
are
fairly
subdued
but
noticeable
i
probably
would
have
missed
specifically
naming
the
coriander
if
the
bottle
didnt
mention
it
the
saltiness
seems
to
become
more
apparent
towards
the
end
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
again
with
some
tart
lemon
notes
definitely
heffeish
but
not
quite
still
a
refreshing
summer
brew
this
beauty
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
cloudy
copper
color
with
swirling
yeast
dregs
and
a
grandiose
crown
of
a
head
that
is
creamy
and
rocky
fantastic
lacing
that
lasts
the
entire
beer
salty
yeast
and
wheat
aromas
with
hints
of
vanilla
banana
pepper
and
coriander
definitely
can
smell
the
coriander
taste
is
smooth
and
full
of
sweet
wheat
beer
esters
banana
cloves
touch
of
vanilla
then
the
saltypepper
flavor
comes
through
in
the
middle
and
adds
a
dryness
and
mineral
content
then
finally
the
finish
is
bready
and
yeasty
amazing
i
could
best
describe
this
beer
as
a
combination
of
a
superb
hefeweizen
with
the
best
components
of
a
wit
beer
added
awesome
easily
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
in
sum
a
solid
tasting
hefeweizen
with
small
but
sizable
untraditional
additions
one
of
the
true
great
finds
in
the
world
of
beer
this
was
my
first
experience
with
gose
i
really
have
no
idea
what
the
beer
is
besides
a
hard
to
find
german
style
very
odd
but
definitely
an
experience
and
not
unpleasant
at
that
pintofale
nailed
it
like
a
cross
between
a
wit
and
a
hefeweiss
a
friend
of
mine
said
it
tasted
like
a
rotbusser
obscure
german
wheatoat
ale
with
coriander
added
if
you
see
this
try
it
excellent
brew
a
lemon
zest
character
is
one
of
the
predominant
fragrant
aromas
that
arise
from
the
glass
strong
floral
smell
as
it
warms
it
has
in
the
nose
a
sort
of
muted
sugar
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
saltwater
taffy
the
tangy
flavor
smacks
of
citric
acid
and
suits
the
light
body
well
so
it
seems
to
start
off
as
a
simple
refresher
but
a
very
textured
midpalate
leads
to
an
almostsalty
flavor
that
masks
any
big
finish
and
lingers
for
minutes
afterwards
if
you
even
think
of
serving
this
at
refrigerator
temperature
smack
yourself
around
a
little
bit
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
too
interesting
to
subdue
this
is
not
your
typical
german
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
reminded
me
slightly
of
allagash
white
one
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
especially
a
fellow
ba
another
beer
of
ethereal
quality
from
b
united
pours
a
lightly
hazy
deep
straw
color
with
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
aromas
of
spiced
bread
with
some
earth
salty
hints
and
some
yeast
derived
phenols
salty
spicy
bread
with
hints
of
lemon
and
a
bit
of
spicy
earthy
yeast
character
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
might
be
a
bit
salty
for
my
tastes
but
it
sure
did
disappear
rather
quickly
a
damn
fine
gose
i
cant
help
but
feel
refreshed
after
finishing
the
growler
at
the
end
of
a
very
hot
day
my
only
criticism
is
that
i
have
to
go
all
the
way
during
early
summer
to
nh
to
get
it
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
halo
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
yeasty
but
sweet
the
taste
is
similar
to
a
saison
but
different
there
is
a
lot
of
yeast
but
its
balanced
by
all
the
beer
has
going
on
its
slightly
tart
salty
and
a
slight
b
o
but
well
balanced
by
the
fruit
from
the
yeast
and
sweetness
from
the
malt
very
drinkable
summery
ale
and
it
completely
hits
the
spot
there
is
no
bitterness
but
it
still
balances
out
nicely
great
beer
to
grab
a
togo
bottle
of
this
was
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
gose
with
an
interesting
flavor
profile
that
was
much
more
quenching
feeling
and
drinkable
then
you
would
think
at
first
ive
had
a
couple
of
these
now
and
i
will
continue
to
seek
more
out
its
definitely
a
style
that
has
my
attention
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
there
is
seemingly
no
alcohol
inclusion
throughout
this
was
fairly
easy
drinking
with
the
salt
addition
really
coming
out
as
it
warms
i
have
not
had
a
ton
of
gose
offering
but
of
the
ones
ive
tried
this
one
had
the
best
saltiness
factor
but
lacked
a
little
bit
in
overall
depth
o
very
interesting
style
lots
of
good
flavors
with
a
weird
salt
taste
thrown
in
still
everything
blends
nicely
for
a
good
drink
very
refreshing
for
sure
overall
this
one
could
have
used
a
little
bit
more
flavor
the
herbal
notes
werent
strong
enough
nice
and
refreshing
but
im
not
sure
id
have
it
again
gose
is
a
rather
rare
german
style
of
beer
similar
to
other
weissbiers
which
focus
on
a
large
portion
of
wheat
how
ever
a
standout
difference
is
the
addition
of
spices
and
salt
portsmouths
starts
with
a
cloudy
yellow
straw
body
and
creamy
lacing
and
a
wheaty
nose
with
green
banana
sweet
herbal
notes
and
a
dusting
of
spice
crisp
up
front
creamy
mouthfeel
beneath
light
bodied
big
smack
of
lemon
bite
sweet
malts
soft
coriander
and
an
underlying
saltiness
mild
green
apple
too
fairly
dry
overall
but
really
dries
up
in
the
finish
moreish
delicious
insanely
drink
able
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
weve
had
to
date
o
this
bottle
is
maybe
two
months
old
and
maybe
that
affects
the
taste
i
find
the
salt
a
little
overwhelming
although
the
beer
would
probably
be
quite
good
with
food
alone
i
didnt
much
care
for
it
after
the
first
few
sips
but
that
would
probably
be
the
case
for
me
with
any
gose
nice
style
new
for
me
easy
drinking
beer
overall
far
too
much
coriander
d
nice
light
and
crisp
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
o
pretty
good
id
say
pretty
enjoyable
pours
a
fairly
clear
yellow
colour
lots
of
white
head
smells
spicy
and
a
touch
yeasty
i
think
i
can
actually
detect
the
coriander
on
the
nose
tastes
yeasty
and
spicy
i
thi
this
is
more
interesting
than
the
ccb
gose
but
there
is
a
light
fruity
characteristic
that
comes
through
thats
more
intigrated
than
the
leipziger
light
feels
lighter
than
the
ccb
gose
still
quite
refreshing
this
really
seems
like
a
clone
of
the
leipzigerr
gose
when
sipped
side
by
side
with
the
trasditional
german
brew
maybe
a
touch
saltier
overall
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
and
was
not
disappointed
this
may
be
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
portsmouth
that
i
have
seen
on
their
menu
multiple
times
nice
light
and
wheaty
this
is
super
sessionable
it
holds
true
to
the
gose
style
and
tastes
noticeably
different
then
other
wheat
beers
md
crisp
mouthfeel
relatively
low
carbonation
good
drinkability
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
o
we
really
enjoyed
this
and
finished
the
bomber
in
about
10
minutes
its
really
easy
to
drink
glad
we
got
to
try
this
one
4
5
draught
at
brewpub
this
one
was
served
in
a
20th
anniversary
flute
it
was
a
cloudy
light
yellow
color
there
was
a
small
white
head
that
left
a
little
lacing
nice
nose
to
it
wheat
coriander
and
lemon
notes
even
a
faint
whiff
of
sea
salt
interesting
flavor
very
dry
but
not
bitter
wheat
spices
and
citrus
some
earthiness
also
this
is
really
different
and
nice
the
beer
color
is
pale
yellow
and
its
slightly
veiled
the
head
is
white
and
sticks
well
to
the
glass
the
aroma
presents
notes
of
lime
and
citrus
some
grassy
notes
too
taste
is
similar
more
lime
and
citrusy
carbonation
is
present
in
the
mouth
medium
body
nice
and
refreshing
a
very
good
summer
beer
a
true
session
beer
too
taste
and
refreshing
nice
love
it
the
cpj
overall
this
was
a
refreshing
beer
to
have
while
sitting
outside
on
my
deck
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
id
probably
try
it
again
or
others
in
the
style
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
with
a
small
head
nose
is
some
grainy
wheat
sourness
lemon
mouth
is
really
grainy
bright
wheat
sour
mash
lemon
salt
soft
and
grainy
soft
in
the
mouth
apparently
portsmouth
was
the
only
brewery
in
the
u
s
to
make
this
style
until
a
few
years
ago
nice
enough
nothing
really
exceptional
but
finely
done
overall
this
was
alright
for
me
for
my
first
gose
style
ill
have
to
try
more
of
this
style
sometime
this
is
a
magnificent
hot
weather
session
brew
with
enough
complexity
to
maintain
my
interest
d
i
had
no
problem
with
the
bottle
but
this
certainly
isnt
a
beginner
beer
if
you
like
a
good
berliner
weisse
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
one
d
a
highly
drinkable
yet
supremely
funky
beer
not
much
of
a
hop
kick
to
speak
of
perhaps
only
contributing
to
a
touch
of
the
dryness
this
beer
is
unlike
any
other
ive
had
and
i
think
the
apple
funk
that
they
add
covers
up
the
usual
unpleasant
funk
bad
wheat
beers
all
too
commonly
exhibit
43
533
53
5
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
a
tulip
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
i
will
ever
have
pretty
excited
the
body
is
hazy
yellow
with
about
a
centimeter
of
white
head
on
top
that
reduces
to
thin
lacing
the
aroma
is
like
a
barnyard
with
lemon
zest
lost
of
grain
kissed
slightly
with
citrus
twang
its
a
really
nice
smell
not
complex
but
the
aromas
are
very
pleasant
starts
nice
and
tart
and
mellows
to
follow
through
with
earthy
grainy
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
carbonation
and
drinkable
as
the
rest
especially
at
4
5
i
did
this
would
really
like
to
try
more
examples
of
the
style
extraordinarily
drinkable
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
wish
to
see
more
of
the
style
good
job
portsmouth
make
sure
to
keep
brewing
this
style
and
i
will
be
sure
to
keep
tracking
it
down
i
was
told
that
if
you
want
to
drink
a
beer
while
exercising
that
this
would
be
the
best
style
to
do
it
because
the
salt
will
balance
your
electrolytes
all
in
all
this
was
an
ok
brew
a
decent
summer
sipper
if
you
get
the
chance
to
try
id
recommend
hunting
down
only
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
gose
style
otherwise
dont
bother
unless
you
have
access
to
the
brewery
very
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
session
beer
d
i
drank
this
down
pretty
fast
and
if
i
were
loitering
at
portsmouth
and
not
driving
to
syracuse
i
would
gladly
have
had
another
the
low
abv
and
refreshing
texture
make
it
a
good
session
option
s
a
nice
beer
for
a
summer
day
i
didnt
really
find
this
representation
of
the
gose
style
to
be
any
different
from
most
other
wheat
beers
ive
had
but
it
was
still
good
it
went
well
with
the
alehosue
muscles
i
hate
to
say
it
but
it
was
a
one
and
done
for
me
i
do
appreciated
the
chance
at
trying
the
style
thanks
guys
gose
was
quite
refreshing
and
even
invigorating
very
drinkable
it
was
a
delightful
surprise
and
seems
an
excellent
choice
for
a
summer
beer
nice
plum
notes
in
the
smell
and
taste
lightly
sour
and
the
sea
salt
adds
a
unique
taste
and
smell
not
found
in
others
the
beer
is
not
excessively
sour
but
thats
a
plus
nice
orange
color
serving
type

tap
flavor
mediumlow
tartness
and
bitterness
lightly
salty
interesting
with
an
unexpected
slight
funk
not
really
to
style
but
a
good
drinking
brew
this
beer
has
as
you
might
expect
mildly
sour
plum
flavors
however
the
flavors
are
very
subdued
and
gentledelicate
even
i
didnt
taste
the
salt
that
others
have
noted
and
that
is
appropriate
for
a
gose
but
i
wasnt
looking
out
for
it
either
beer
is
rather
thin
and
light
a
little
on
the
crisp
side
definitely
refreshing
and
pleasant
but
not
super
memorable
poured
a
gorgeous
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
quite
nice
looking
scents
of
fruity
esters
ume
plums
salt
water
and
apricot
very
nice
crisp
and
inviting
not
overly
complex
but
very
reminiscent
of
umeboshi
taste
begins
with
flavors
of
apricot
ume
plum
and
a
nice
fruity
sourness
in
the
middle
sourness
increases
and
a
pleasant
undercurrent
of
salt
water
appears
the
finish
is
sour
ume
plum
salt
water
and
a
hint
of
grainy
malt
aftertaste
is
sour
with
grainy
malt
and
salty
undertones
a
very
refreshing
flavor
that
combines
ume
a
and
other
fruit
flavors
with
salt
and
sour
and
a
hint
of
grain
very
well
done
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
juicy
feel
very
light
and
refreshing
excellent
overall
this
is
an
excellent
ale
though
i
cannot
rightly
compare
it
to
other
goses
what
it
is
is
a
nice
refreshing
ale
with
a
nice
uniquely
japanese
flavor
i
recommend
it
o
overall
this
beer
was
just
delicious
the
salty
sour
sweet
going
on
was
incredible
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
bottles
of
this
o
my
wife
tasted
this
beer
and
just
said
it
tastes
weird
anyway
i
like
it
its
sour
sweet
and
salty
give
it
a
try
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
come
across
this
unique
brew
from
what
must
be
japans
most
prestigious

and
makes
this
a

i
have
had
only
a
few
examples
of
the
style
so
i
figured
today
would
be
a
good
day
to
revisit
it

getting

of
anything
very

it
kinda
turned
me
off
a
littletoasted

and
the
hint
of

in

i
know
the
gose
is
becoming
a
fashionable
style
right
now
but
its
not
my
thingthis
is
a
good
example
though
and
i
tried
to
rate
accordingly
disgusting
not
the
gose
style
im
used
to
tastes
like
dirty
socks
overall
i
can
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
beers
generally
recommended
as
a
staple
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
nice
wellexecuted
gose
not
too
overdone
on
the
salt
or
sour
aspects
with
a
pleasant
depth
of
character

medium

a
really
nice
example
of
the
style
with
all
flavors
handled
lightly
but
nicely
balanced
the
tartness
is
well
supported
by
the
wheat
body
both
coriander
and
salt
are
deftly
integrated
im
not
a
sour
beer
fan
but
found
this
nicely
made
lightly
tart
beer
to
be
refreshing
and
tasty
very
solid
gose
literally
dissipates
in
your
mouth
lemon
zest
and
yeast
with
the
salt
is
very
nice
a
great
gose
had
it
alongside
leipziger
gose
of
bayerisches
bahnhof
in
ohne
bedenken
in
leipzig
this
one
is
slightly
more
complex
and
agressive
sourer
and
saltier
the
other
one
is
more
refreshing
nice
beer
but
for
me
the
style
is
much
less
exciting
than
for
example
geueze
or
witbier
similar
to
berliner
weisse
interesting
unique
musttry
for
beer
geeks
yes
but
if
that
would
be
the
only
available
beer
style
out
there
id
drink
much
more
water
and
wine
for
sure
pours
a
cloudy
dirty
straw
yellow
with
a
white

the
beer
shows
active

a
fine

plenty
of

the

is
funky

is
nice
with
some
tartness
wheat
straw
hops
and
lemon
peel
slightly

but
in
no
way
salty
or
brine
influenced
this
beer
is
perfect
for
what
it
is
it
has
balance
hops
grain
and
a
bit
of
that
sour
that
beer
loves
seek
a
lovely
beer
and
perfection
to
style
would
be
worth
revisiting
pale

nice

indeed
o
eh
it
might
be
more
true
to
style
than
westbrook
gose
but
still
not
as
enjoyable
for
me
o
not
extreme
in
any
way
yet
distinct
piquant
acidity
wisps
away
quickly
while
ensuring
a
high
rate
of
refreshment
and
drinkability
while
its
soft
saltiness
lingers
to
highlight
echoes
of
bread
dough
in
aftertaste
otherwise
a
light
bodied
ale
the
taste
of
brine
that
clings
on
tightly
to
the
mouth
gives
the
ale
an
impression
of
fullness
that
has
a
bit
more
staying
power
on
the
palate
than
expected
big
fan
of
the
style
and
this
one
did
not
let
me
down
had
it
side
by
side
with
lost
nation
gose
to
compare
this
one
was
slightly
more
funky
but
not
quite
as
clean
great
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
o
i
really
love
the
malttotang
ratio
in
this
one
tang
is
still
on
top
but
the
bready
malt
character
mellows
and
balances
it
out
classic
my
first
sour
really
enjoyed
it
best
way
i
can
personally
describe
it
is
if
mead
had
a
beer
a
well
rounded
gose
overall
a
great
benchmark
for
the
style
isnt
overly
tart
or
malt
forward
you
get
both
aspects
without
one
drowning
the
other
out
i
would
definitely
buy
more
of
this
in
the
future
when
im
looking
for
a
gose
fix
i
cant
say
that
its
perfect
for
every
occasion
or
for
volume
but
its
a
perfect
situation
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
tartness
and
the
saltiness
open
the
tastebuds
and
besides
its
just
a
delicious
beer
the
fiancee
really
liked
it
as
wellher
first
goseand
said
it
was
more
refreshing
than
a
shandy
and
tasted
much
better

i
may
have
missed
the

qualities

the
style
should
have

might
deduct
points

overall
flavor
is
very
nice

a

great
beer
i
really
enjoy
how
different
this
style
of
beer
is
smells
of
tart
lacto
big
nodes
of
red
cherries
tastes
like
cherries
up
front
corriander
and
salt
near
the
middle
and
it
finishes
with
the
sharp
esterlessness
you
get
out
of
a
lowhop
european
pils
basically
its
like
a
combination
between
a
good
berliner
weiss
and
a
good
continental
pilsener
and
its
much
more
balanced
than
any
of
the
america
goses
ive
drank
well
done
o
this
is
very
tasty
an
excellent
gose
and
an
examplar
of
a
style
thats
catching
on
at
long
last
recommended
for
sure
pours
an
almost
clear
light
amber
with
quick
fading
white
head
nectarine
lactic
with
some
herbal
oakiness
and
white
wine
notes
taste
wheat
cracker
lactic
with
some
stone
fruit
sweetness
and
tart
red
grapes
mildly
oaky
again
light
bodied
building
delicate
carbonation
really
tasty
the
flavor
is
pretty
full
of
wheat
with
creamy
quality
combined
with
yeast
and
light
salt
which
supports
and
doesnt
overwhelm
with
a
gentle
toastiness
in
the
malt
and
gentle
lemon
tanginess
which
goes
with
the
salt
creating
an
urge
to
return
for
repeated
sips
with
that
salty
berliner
type
tang
you
expect
overall
definitely
tasty
and
lovely
with
delicious
wheat
and
very
highly
quaffableone
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
had
i
appreciate
the
subtlety
there
is
not
too
much
going
on
very
traditional
quality
yet
excellent
for
the
season
a
perfect
warm
weather
beer
which
is
quenching
and
refreshing
overall
a
solid
take
on
the
style
could
easily
be
up
there
with
some
of
my
favoritesplenty
of
tart
and
salt
but
isnt
just
an
overpowering
sour
bomb
there
is
actually
subtlety
of
flavor
going
on
here
o
im
no
gose
expert
but
im
gonna
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
predict
this
is
a
pretty
accurate
take
on
the
traditional
style
simpler
and
subtler
than
westbrooks
gose
for
example
and
maybe
not
as
appealing
to
a
more
americanized
palate
but
i
found
it
delightful
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
best
gose
so
far
to
date
the
sour
german
beer
comment
on
the
back
label
is
truthful
through
and
though
ill
be
looking
for
this
again
no
doubt
o
a
tasty
beer
i
feel
that
i
will
be
picking
this
up
some
more
this
summer
o
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
beer
but
its
just
not
for
me
it
has
an
uncommon
taste
for
todays
brews
but
its
quite
enjoyable
quite
tart
almost
within
the
family
of
lambics
but
without
the
lingering
aftertaste
not
nearly
as
flat
as
the
initial
appearance
but
the
carbonation
is
still
well
below
my
expectations
the
body
is
on
the
thin
sidereminds
me
of
apple
juice
frankly
this
is
a
bit
disappointing
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
twofinger
head
thats
quick
to
disappear
leaving
a
ring
of
white
bubbles
around
the
surface
the
smell
is
briny
with
coriander
wheat
and
bread
yeast
it
tastes
of
tart
lemon
wheat
and
bread
and
finishes
salty
the
combination
of
sour
flavors
with
salty
ones
is
surprisingly
pleasant
the
body
is
light
and
its
very
drinkable
light
to
medium
body
really
good
and
refreshing
i
really
like
this
bottle
from
proof
pours
a
clear
straw
with
bubbly
white
head
that
faded
pretty
quickly
to
nothing
no
wisps
collar
anything
aroma
is
grassy
and
dry
yeast
tartness
taste
is
tart
throughout
slightl
pear
fruitiness
and
slightly
metallic
light
body
and
low
carbonation
very
drinkable
though
though
i
am
pretty
inexperienced
when
it
comes
to
the
style
id
say
this
is
a
good
amount
more
sour
than
the
one
other
ive
tried
lost
nation
gose
which
makes
this
one
a
little
less
refreshingdrinkable
but
still
a
nice
interplay
of
saltysour
and
german
malt
flavor
this
is
excellent
tart
crisp
refreshing
and
delicous
for
my
first
encounter
with
a
gose
things
went
well
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
gose
far
more
tart
and
saline
than
the
freigeist
offering
ive
had
several
times
and
probably
a
little
bit
more
authentic
as
doesnt
have
any
spruce
added
as
a
major
component
to
the
brewing
process
its
not
mind
blowing
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
its
refreshing
while
holding
a
unique
flavor
profile
and
fills
itself
with
subtle
flavors
and
textures
recommended
for
those
wanting
to
try
a
more
sour
offering
of
the
style
thats
german
brewed
i
would
say
for
the
sake
of
the
beers
freshness
that
this
must
be
consumed
best
on
tap
o
not
as
refreshing
or
complex
as
others
examples
of
the
style
so
it
would
not
be
one
of
the
first
gose
beers
that
i
would
reach
for
easy
enough
to
drink
but
just
not
quite
as
interesting
as
others
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
seems
to
lack
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
top
beers
in
the
style
far
more
tart
than
anticipated
this
reads
more
like
a
sour
than
other
examples
ive
tried
and
is
likely
the
most
authentic
somewhat
one
note
but
i
like
that
note
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
sampled
a
beer
of
this
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
i
usually
like
beers
on
the
heavy
end
but
this
proved
to
be
an
interesting
change
of
pace

the
beer
pours
a
dark
hazy
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
sodapop
head
that
quickly
fizzles
away
in

the
beer
is
dark

translucent
showing
murky
cloudy
hints

of
the
glass
along
with
a
healthy
torrent
of
bubbles
no
particles
can
be
seen
in

the
beer
smells
lightly
tart
and
wheaty

a
wheat
flake
and
a
subdued
berliner
weisse
light
saline
notes
also
puff
upon

i
dont

i
would
detect
them
if
i
didnt

gose
lemon

is
light
yet
bright
on
the
nose
giving
a
nice
pop
and
inviting
you
to
drink
the
beer
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
initially
tart
nearly
puckering
but
this
mellows
into
a
soft
bready
sweetness
with
just
a
touch
of
saltiness
and
a
deeper
earthy
sense
to
suggest
that
this
is
a
gose
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
sharp
lemonlime
citrus
which
mellows
into
sweet
lemon
then
lemon
bread
and
then
slowly
works
into
a
soft
fluffy
wheat
flake
flavor
that
finishes
soft
and
comforting
on
the
tongue
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
the
earthy
and
mineral
flavors
can
be
distinctly
sensed
as
the
lemon
citrus
dies
down
the
aftertaste
is
soft
but
distinctly
flavored
with
wheat
malt
notes
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
fizzy
yet
light
in
body
the
carbonation
is

slightly
sharp
effervescence
that
snaps
upon
the
tongue
and
gives
the
beer
a
crispness
the
mouth
is
left
wet
with
acidcanceling
saliva
on
the
cheeks
and
a
very
soft
chalkiness
overall
this
beer
is
hugely
refreshing
and
very
tasty
its
not
quite
as
salty
as
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
but
its
the
first
oldworld
gose
ive
tried
so
i
blame
new
world
interpretations
for
making
me
expect
big
salt
the
beer
is
soft
yet
nuanced
like
a
wellcrafted
ginger
ale
with
alcohol
and
deeper
citrus
flavors
its
crisp
refreshing
and
perfect
to
slake
your
thirst
in
summer
try
this
beer
from
the
bottle
it
pours
a
medium
golden
orange
brown
with
a
thin
foamy
white
head
not
much
lace
clings
to
the
glass
and
the
appearance
shows
a
wheaty
haze
but
with
bright
small
champagnelike
bubbles
rising
there
is
a
slight
orangelemon
malty
aroma
a
crisp
but
mild
tartness
some
sweet
wheat
hefeweis
a
little
bright
lemon
soapy
snap
coriander
and
a
nice
subtle
salt
rounding
out
tongue
a
little
mild
in
mouthfeel
but
refreshing
café
beer
for
hot
day
especially
by
the
ocean
great
refreshing
summer
sip
for
those
who
like
sour
beers
or
are
open
to
variety
very
few
others
are
similar
drinkability
this
is
one
that
id
definitely
pick
up
it
has
sparked
my
interest
in
the
style
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
others
in
this
style
as
well
yes
i
do
like
it
too
bad
i
cant
order
this
by
the

something
i
wish
it
had
a
little

more
bready
malts
and
chewy
sense
though
in
the
palate
and
flavor
i
wouldnt
pass
this
up
though
great
warm
weather
beer
and
one
to
session
nicely
also
o
a
very
good
gose
a
bit
pricey
at
close
to
6
50
for
the
pint
but
you
dont
see
this
style
too
often
pour
a
pale
orange
quite
cloudy
though
thats
not
exactly
a
surprise
after
following
the
labels
advice
to
stir
up
the
yeast

pouring
foamy

decent

lemony

some

in

background
apricot

blackberry
taste
is
lactic
tart
with
some
nice
spice
and
fruit
flavors
and
a
salty
undercurrent
its
quite
yogurty
lactic
like
unsweetened
yogurt
mixed
with
lemon
rind
little
to
no

sweetness
and
absolutely
no
hop
character
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
theres
a
little
body
to
the
beer
but
its
pretty
crisp
the
lack
of
malt
sweetness
makes
the
beer
feel
quite
clean
fun
beer
always
nice
to
find
a
gose
this
would
be
a
fun
beer
to
pair
with
food
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slight
sourness
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
refreshing
a
very
unique
beer
even
for
the
already
unique
gose
style
which
i
keep
hearing
pronounced
differently
but
thats
another
matter
the
pour
is
cloudy
and
pale
underwhelming
to
say
the
least
but
the
nose
is
really
inspiring
it
smells
like
a
funky
wheat
beer
almost
like
a
saison
as
there
is
plenty
of
interesting
yeast
and
some
lemony
funk
but
its
also
sour
i
think
a
sour
gose
hmmmm
the
taste
does
confirm
a
touch
of
sourness
to
this
really
different
the
salt
isnt
as
intense
as
in
some
versions
of
the
style
which
is
fine
with
me
its
just
enough
to
dry
up
the
finish
and
keep
you
asking
what
the
hell
this
beer
is
super
different
the
wheat
malt
and
the
sourness
make
a
clever
combination
unlike
anything
ive
ever
tried
it
got
too
much
for
me
after
a
bit
and
im
glad
i
had
help
with
the
bottle
nice
feel
well
carbonated
and
a
very
light
body
i
think
i
would
like
this
best
as
a
summer
beer
there
is
so
much
going
on
here
between
the
salt
and
the
sour
crank
up
the
alcohol
and
itd
be
more
like
a
cocktail
than
a
beer
but
its
very
inventive
and
apparently
quite
traditional
at
the
same
time
id
recommend
this
only
to
the
adventurous
beer
drinker
overall
an
interesting
beer
well
done
gose
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
wonderful
tough
to
make
a
comparison
as
this
is
a
style
that
is
just
hard
to
find
overall
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
if
you
are
one
who
likes
sours
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
pours
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
and
lots
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
the
head
dissipates
at
a
moderate
pace
leaving
little
splotches
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
is
only
the
slightest
bit
of
haze
in
the
beer
there
are
aromas
of
lemon
barley
and
wheat
malt
and
a
slight
tartness
from
the
lactic
acid
the
saltiness
comes
through
in
the
flavor
which
combines
well
with
the
tartness
of
the
lactic
acid
theres
the
wheat
and
barley
malt
flavors
as
well
as
the
lemon
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
theres
some
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
beer
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
that
faded
quickly
there
is
no
retention
or
lacing
on
this
one
the
smell
has
the
lactic
acid
coming
through
strong
with
some
subtle
wheat
but
not
much
coriander
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
dominant
tart
flavor
up
front
with
a
soft
wheat
finish
the
slat
and
coriander
are
very
subtle
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
nice
carbonation
and
drinkable
overall
i
feel
the
lactic
acid
is
a
little
too
much
on
this
beer
perhaps
its
just
me
either
way
its
always
fun
to
try
these
types
of
beers
to
see
how
they
differ
worth
trying
overall
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
lots
of
tart
sour
citrus
taste
but
not
over
the
top
and
in
your
face
it
comes
through
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
each
sip
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
beer
again
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
bottle
poured
a
hazy
hay
color
gose
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
tart
notes
is
pretty
dominant
with
some
light
salty
notes
also
distinguishable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
salty
notes
with
quite
strong
tart
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
great
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
a
lot
more
tart
and
lactic
acid
notes
then
expected
with
almost
no
coriander
beer
is
mediumlight
to
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
levels
of
carbonation
for
the
heft
this
makes
the
beer
quite
propulsive
on
the
palate
slightly
prickly
but
generally
a
fast
sipper
the
salt
adds
to
the
drying
effect
of
the
beer
itself
making
this
quite
dry
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
on
the
mouth
after
each
sip
b
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
tall
white
head
not
like
the
other
examples
of
gose
that
ive
had
there
is
a
slight
saltiness
to
the
nose
but
its
more
lactic
than
expected
nice
lemon
peel
and
a
bit
of
spice
coriander
to
it
some
sweet
malt
aroma
too
the
flavor
is
a
nice
mix
of
sweet
and
tart
with
lemon
peel
and
lactic
acidity
a
subtle
salt
and
spice
flavor
is
present
really
just
light
and
easy
to
drink
o
good
the
only
thing
missing
here
is
a
hint
of
coriander
to
help
fully
round
this
one
out
i
think
a
blend
of
the
two
goses
from
the
region
would
be
a
good
drink
this
one
is
preferred
though
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
gose
although
i
would
have
preferred
more
of
funky
goodness
in
short
an
acidic
saline
crisp
dry
and
very
refreshing
example
of
the
style
that
survived
the
enforcement
of
the
purity
law
i
would
say
this
is
a
little
bit
more
traditional
than
the
bahnhof
variety
just
because
i
get
more
of
the
strong
wheat
beer
taste
here
but
honestly
i
think
theyre
both
excellent
beers
everyone
should
make
a
trip
to
leipzig
to
try
them
d
if
you
like
sour
beers
this
is
a
wonderful
one
certainly
a
very
interesting
beer
but
not
one
i
could
imagine
drinking
regularly
drink
again
overall
an
interesting
and
unique
style
much
less
brew
worth
a
look
if
you
can
find
it
the
bottle
looks
good
but
i
dont
like
this
old
man
on
the
front
label
fine
sourishspicy
aroma
tastes
really
good
i
think
a
mix
between
berliner
weisse
and
a
hefeweizen
a
little
bit
sourish
with
woody
notes
but
also
fruity
like
lemon
and
apricot
very
refreshing
very
enjoyable
drinkable
and
pleasant
dmy
first
gose
and
i
found
it
very
drinkable
refreshing
tart
and
sessionable
overall
what
an
amazing
beer
i
had
tried
the
bayerischer
bahnhof
gose
on
tap
in
the
states
and
this
put
bbahnhof
to
shame
the
lactic
acid
is
assertive
but
not
as
dominating
as
it
is
in
a
berliner
weisse
i
suppose
it
cant
be
if
you
want
the
coriander
and
salt
contributions
to
come
through
and
while
the
salt
gave
it
an
earthy
quality
it
never
becomes
savory
the
salt
complements
the
sweetness
of
the
wheat
malt
and
coriander
in
the
same
way
that
you
add
salt
to
cookies
and
other
sweets
overall
there
are
some
unique
flavors
here
that
all
come
together
to
make
something
unexpected
and
remarkable
while
bbahnhof
plays
it
safe
doellnitzerohne

goes
all
the
way
to
make

beer
if
you
are

you

by

up

rather

not

does

as

every

nuisances
but
this

becomes
cloying

recedes

some

relatively
low

due

the

combo
that
was
a

much
for
my

is
very
low
due

the
intensity

a

and
id
probably
max
out
at
a
6
oz
serving
good
for
something
different
and
always
relish
the
opportunity
to
try
new
styles
finally
found
this
beer
and
got
a
bonus
of
it
being
on
sale
as
no
one
wants
to
drink
that
crap
well
i
dont
know
why
as
i
didnt
find
anything
wrong
with
it
it
pours
maybe
a
shade
or
two
darker
than
a
normal
hefe
but
not
as
dark
as
a
dunkle
not
too
much
head
on
this
one
might
be
due
to
the
salt
smell
is
also
reminicent
of
a
hefe
with
an
added
spicy
element
taste
is
smooth
at
first
with
the
banana
and
clove
esters
usually
associated
with
german
wheat
beers
however
at
the
end
the
salt
is
slightly
noticable
and
drys
the
beer
out
in
the
mouth
i
had
been
told
that
this
beer
tasted
like
licking
a
salt
lick
that
is
not
the
case
carbonation
is
nice
and
this
one
goes
down
pretty
smoothly
not
sure
if
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
an
evening
but
one
or
two
with
dinner
would
be
fine
i
will
definately
give
this
a
shot
again
this
was
a
very
well
made
beer
unfortunately
id
set
my
sights
on
something
absolutely
unique
and
the
gose
style
was
not
surprisingly
hoppy
smell
hazy
gold
with
a
nice
creamy
head
very
visibly
carbonated
with
the
carbonation
lending
a
tang
to
the
flavor
almost
takes
like
a
belgian
triple
but
certainly
closer
to
belgian
in
flavor
than
any
other
german
beer
cloves
and
banana
came
through
along
with
a
nice
malt
sweetness
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
you
can
find
it
dont
want
to
repeat
this
fresh
cannot
imagine
any
impact
would
be
had
here
unfiltered
in
appearance
grapefruit
pink
in
color
with
thin
bubbly
light
pinkish
white
head
smells
fruity
sweet
and
sour
medium
in
carbonation
taste
is
very
odd
not
sure
what
hibiscus
tastes
like
but
probably
this
has
a
rotten
fruit
aftertaste
that
is
pretty
nasty
not
really
sour
at
all
like
i
was
hoping
taste
kind
of
bland
and
flat
lame
o
wow
what
a
downer
it
looked
beautiful
but
taste
was
extremely
lacking
i
almost
feel
like
this
was
not
a
gose
it
was
slightly
tart
but
lacked
the
salt
and
lactic
flavor
i
was
looking
for
in
a
gose
it
also
lacked
a
distinct
marionberry
flavor
and
tasted
more
like
old
cranberries
and
i
only
got
hibiscus
in
the
scent
not
the
flavors
i
would
not
buy
again
nor
would
i
recommend
it
poured
into
a

a
good
bit
under

there

at

the

a
4pack
overall
a
nice
crisp
gose
would
have
liked
to
see
the
salt
aspect
for
the
style
but
still
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
overall
i
have
no
idea
how
to
rate
this
to
style
this
is
the
third
time
ive
tried
a
gose
and
each
time
has
been
different
than
the
previous
the
first
tasted
like
a
salty
tart
hefeweizen
the
second
was
more
like
a
really
sour
berliner
weisse
and
this
one
is
like
a
boring
fruit
beer
this
is
easily
the
worst
of
the
three
and
i
wont
be
having
it
again
marionberry

gose
pours
a
bright
blood
red
color
with
a
very
small
head
their
is
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
from
the
marionberries
the
taste
has
a
nice
subtle
sweetness
strong
marionberry
flavors
and
hints
of
coriander
easy
to
drink
but
slightly
watery
and
could
benefit
from
some
higher
levels
of
carbonation
overall
its
a
good
beer
tastes
more
of
a
fruit
style
then
a
gose
however
an
interesting
beer
and
worth
trying
at
least
once
o
ive
had
a
couple
of
these
over
the
last
year
and
while
it
isnt
my
favorite
it
always
leaves
me
wanting
another
i
like
the
style
and
its
crisp
and
refreshing
its
not
for
everyone
if
you
like
the
sour
beers
you
might
like
this
taste
is
pleasantly
tart
but
not
sweet
the
hibiscus
adds
a
floral
tinge
and
the
coriander
imparts
a
lightly
spicy
hint
towards
the
finish
but
overall
the
flavor
is
marionberry
its
a
little
sour
and
a
nicely
light
session
beer
that
breaks
the
mold
a
bit
sick
beer
unfiltered
wheat
beer
so
it
has
this
deep
beautiful
red
color
it
comes
off
sour
at
first
and
hits
you
with
a
huge
fruit
note
virtually
no
hops
flavor
so
it
actually
disguises
itself
as
a
beer
pretty
well
therefore
not
for
picky
hop
heads
or
those
not
into
sours
or
fruit
beers
on
the
other
hand
perfect
for
people
into
fruitier
things
so
drinkable
and
tasty
pours
a
hazy
deep
pink
to
reddish
color
with
a
small
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
coriander
and
a
fruity
to
tart
berries
in
the
taste
starts
dry
to
a
cranberry
juice
cocktail
flavor
to
dry
end
a
spice
like
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fruitiness
to
clean
aftertaste
note
really
sure
what
marionberry
should
taste
like
but
quite
cranberry
like
mouthfeel
is
flat
and
smooth
overall
im
not
a
fan
at
all
and
i
think
im
going
to
dump
this
out
overall
it
was
good
and
surprisingly
enjoyable
it
looked
weird
smelled
kind
of
off
and
tasted
like
a
wine
cooler
yet
came
together
and
worked
its
hard
to
pinpoint
the
reasons
why
it
worked
but
to
me
it
did
so
id
have
this
beer
again
not
too
familiar
with
marionberry
hibiscus
or
the
gose
style
for
that
matter
but
i
was
able
to
overlook
the
sweetness
and
enjoy
this
interesting
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
remarkable
o
this
is
an
interesting
style
my
first
sample
the
fruityacidic
element
works
pretty
well
together
would
like
to
try
more
of
the
gose
style
enjoyable

after

but
a

hard
to
judge
this
one
other
than
i
enjoyed
but
one
12
oz
serving
would
be
enough
at
a
time
ive
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
awhile
this
marionberry
gose
pours
a
rose
reddish
pink
in
color
with
light
carbonation
that
dies
off
quickly
the
nose
is
light
with
some
berry
and
floral
characteristics
but
no
typical
gose
wheat
or
salt
water
the
flavors
too
light
berry
and
some
hibiscus
character
it
is
lightly
tart
but
its
slight
if
anything
there
is
more
sweet
berry
than
i
anticipated
it
is
very
light
in
body
with
little
carbonation
its
approachable
but
nothing
really
impressive
this
could
be
used
as
a
good
gateway
to
get
girls
into
craft
d
very
drinkable
nice
overall
balance
with
some
good
berry
flavor
tartness
and
acidity
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
interesting
beer
for
the
style
and
something
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
addition
of
marionberries
and
hibiscus
really
helps
make
the
beer
easy
to
drink
akin
to
putting
fruit
syrup
in
a
berliner
weissbier
o
right
off
the
bat
from
the
appearance
you
can
tell
this
beer
contains
both
hibiscus
and
berries
there
is
a
pleasant
amount
of
tartness
but
overall
this
flavors
in
this
beer
are
rather
subtle
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
you
have
to
hand
it
to
them
for
coming
up
with
a
brew
like
this
old
world
style
meets
extreme
brewing
i
think
the
level
of
tartness
works
here
though
it
would
have
come
across
better
if
the
beer
was
dryer
overall
refreshing
but
a
little
too
subdued
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
introduce
more
mainstream
drinkers
to
the
concept
that
some
beers
can
be
tart
o
not
very
impressive
interesting
ingredients
but
underrealized
overall
more
of
a
fruit
punch
and
a
beer
i
think
my
forst
gose
and
from
what
i
have
read
about
the
style
it
is
true
to
it
unfiltered
wheat
ale
with
a
berry
syrup
to
balance
the
acidic
quality
of
the
wheat
ale
its
ok
but
not
an
everyday
sort
of
brew
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
nothing
special
about
it
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
of
it
might
be
a
good
hot
day
beer
though
o
a
solid
fruit
beer
really
its
just
the
nice
berry
flavour
blind
id
never
know
this
was
a
gose
it
doesnt
offer
much
in
the
way
of
style
o
ive
had
a
few
other
gose
beers
before
and
though
they
arent
really
my
thing
this
fruity
more
mainstream
take
on
them
sounded
good
to
me
boy
was
i
wrong
this
beer
really
misses
the
mark
in
every
way
for
me
im
probably
going
to
pour
the
rest
of
this
bomber
down
the
drain
overall
i
can
think
of
100
fruit
beers
better
than
this
one
if
i
want
a
winey
beer
dfh
red
white
is
better
not
to
mention
the
raspberry
rocket
fuel
called
fort
no
repeat
sale
on
this
one
overall
i
love
the
bizarre
experimentation
that
this
beer
represents
i
think
it
has
flaws
but
it
is
refreshing
and
certainly
drinkable
on
a
hot
enough
day
id
have
this
again
an
enjoyable
if
somewhat
specialized
brew
wouldnt
be
first
on
my
list
to
buy
again
but
ill
be
trying
other
goses
gosen
on
the
strength
of
this
o
basically
an
experimental
beer
thats
kind
of
hit
and
miss
not
undrinkable
but
there
are
better
examples
of
a
gose
out
there
taste
brings
forth
the
berry
and
coriander
up
front
a
touch
of
apparent
salinity
on
the
close
and
a
lingering
fruitiness
after
no
hop
bite
though
a
touch
of
hops
is
offered
on
the
aroma
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
light
in
body
touch
of
salty
tartness
though
not
tart
by
any
means
interesting
entree
to
the
style
though
likely
a
bit
of
an
outlier
the
aroma
is
floral
and
tart
from
berries
as
well
as
slightly
funky
the
appearance
is
raspberry
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
average
overall
i
want
to
like
this
beer
because
the
concept
is
so
cool
but
it
is
just
not
that
good
its
is
just
too
weird
pours
a
murky
turbid
raspberry
color
with
a
12
inch
foamy
light
red
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
somewhat
tart
and
sour
with
some
sour
berry
and
hibiscus
aromas
interestingly
enough
the
smells
actually
seem
to
disappear
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
slightly
tart
with
sour
berry
and
hibiscus
flavors
up
front
followed
by
grain
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
crisp
and
slightly
acidic
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
can
see
being
a
good
introduction
to
sours
for
beginners
but
to
me
its
not
worth
revisiting
the
body
was
very
good
light
but
still
substantial
but
not
heavy
or
cloying
the
beer
had
good
carbonation
that
carried
the
flavors
across
the
tongue
easily
drinkability
was
very
good
this
was
a
rare
case
where
if
i
had
another
22
i
would
have
opened
it
immediately
which
goes
to
show
my
point
if
brewers
would
put
these
brews
into
sixers
instead
of
22s
i
could
have
had
34
and
still
had
some
left
over
overall
in
my
limited
experience
with
the
gose
style
this
wasnt
really
a
typical
example
but
was
still
quite
enjoyable
no
aspect
of
this
beer
dominated
but
the
beer
was
very
well
combined
i
enjoyed
this
beer
much
more
than
the
number
shows
its
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
ill
be
grabbing
another
bottle
or
two
overall
its
an
ok
drinking
brew
but
not
what
i
am
in
the
mood
for
this
isnt
my
thing
and
this
is
not
what
i
want
when
i
want
a
gose
easy
drinking
with
some
unique
characteristics
though
fairly
subtle
overall
overall
this
is
just
a
really
fun
and
different
beer
and
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
and
its
in
fourpacks
for
relatively
cheap
too
o
really
not
impressive
berry
notes
are
subdued
and
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
very
light
maybe
thats
what
its
supposed
to
be
im
no
gose
expert
so
if
you
like
these
kinds
of
beers
this
may
be
supremely
drinkable
come
summertime
im
totally
charmed
by
this
stuff
if
its
not
anything
like
the
ancient
style
its
what
i
like
about
the
world
beer
movement
take
inspiration
and
make
it
drinkable
they
could
make
another
version
without
the
training
wheels
though
another
of
the
userfriendly
oddball
beers
from
widmer
kind
of
a
bland
attempt
at
a
gose
its
got
wheat
brewing
salts
and
a
touch
of
funk
but
it
isnt
quite
there
certainly
a
style
of
beer
that
shouldnt
be
done
in
large
batches
and
with
any
brewers
house
yeast
or
fermentation
style
this
is
strictly
a
style
all
in
its
own
and
should
be
brewed
as
such
it
wasnt
tart
enough
for
me
funky
enough
nor
did
it
have
the
fruit
i
was
expecting
after
seeing
its
color
want
a
good
gose
hit
up
upright
or
breakside
or
better
yet
grab
a
nice
berliner
weisse
and
add
a
little
marionberry
syrup
to
it
this
beer
captures
everything
i
liked
despite
the
off
white
head
that
is
gone
in
a
flash
and
the
red
color
the
beer
is
light
carbinated
and
refreshing
no
hops
at
all
and
a
light
sour
light
lemons
great
mouthfeel
and
taste

overall
id
tone
down
the
hibiscus
and
let
the
berries
shine
a
little
more
the
salinity
is
spot
on
but
there
should
also
be
a
bit
of
tartness
not
the
best
attempt
but
im
glad
to
see
a
big
name
getting
into
the
style
i
am
very
curious
to
try
this
as
gose
is
not
an
everyday
style
also
as
a
u
s
navy
retiree
i
am
definitely
a
salty
dog
i
used
a

to

the

the

i
served

my

was
watering
both
from
the
memory
and
at
the
prospect
of
what
was
to
come
mouthfeel
was

the
taste
was
salty
sure
and
slightly
spicy
but
in
both
instances
they
seemed
muted
this
lacked
ooomph
to
make
it
a
really
standout
gose
finish
was
dry
but
it
could
have
been
so
much
more
flavor
tastes
much
like
a
pilsener
combined
with
a
wheat
beer
there
is
a
pleasant
barley
malt
flavor
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
and
just
a
hint
of
spice
from
the
coriander
i
assume
but
it
is
not
strong

way

this

was
a

from

beers
ive
had
of
late
my
first
of
the
style
as
well
not
sure
how
representative
this
is
but
i
liked
it
great
beer
for
the
summer
months

taste
rating
is
a

overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
lightness
and
decent
spiciness
on
the
back
with
this
amalgamation
of
raw
and
unfiltered
ingredients
we
were
worried
about
getting
a
big
muddled
ball
of
contrasting
elements
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
the
opposite
as
the
finish
while
watered
was
clean
and
relatively
spicy
this
beer
was
actually
much
more
reminiscent
of
a
lighter
more
watery
wit
than
your
traditional
gose
the
spice
was
there
through
clove
and
coriander
but
any
salty
wheatiness
fell
to
the
wayside
with
more
pale
overly
adjuncty
malts
as
a
whole
the
yeast
was
also
a
bit
too
overrepresented
giving
palpable
muck
to
the
feel
and
powder
dryness
while
we
commend
magic
hat
for
attempting
the
style
we
are
left
wanting
a
bit
more
substance
and
a
lot
more
flavor
i
give
magic
hat
a
lot
of
credit
for
always
being
bold
and
trying
new
things
ambitious
styles
and
just
overall
far
out
stuff
but
i
criticize
them
for
doing
all
of
them
within
the
safe
realm
not
quite
authentic
and
sort
of
leaning
towards
mass
appeal
usually
it
works
just
fine
for
me
but
you
cant
half
ass
a
gose
a
salted
wheat
beer
recipe
resurrected
from
yesteryear
cannot
be
played
safe
im
sorry
pours
clean
and
mostly
clear
duller
golden
with
a
finger
or
so
of
off
white
suds
fine
lace
left
behind
the
nose
is
straight
coriander
fresh
green
leaves
not
seeds
or
extract
very
vegetative
and
it
detracts
from
the
minerally
salt
and
bready
wheat
malt
i
want
to
be
paying
attention
too
the
taste
is
equally
overherbed
with
the
salt
only
coming
in
the
finish
its
not
dry
not
refreshing
sort
of
like
a
pretzel
its
a
great
snack
gets
the
job
done
takes
the
edge
off
the
hunger
but
doesnt
fill
you
up
or
leave
you
completely
satisfied
like
a
precursor
for
something
that
never
comes
thats
this
beer
through
and
through
much
left
to
be
desired
i
want
a
salty
stop
in
the
feel
and
i
want
an
effervescent
carbonation
that
keeps
it
moving
and
both
are
absent
but
i
cant
be
too
hard
on
this
nobody
makes
a
gose
and
i
love
the
effort
to
reintroduce
the
style
to
america
i
also
love
its
drinkability
maybe
i
wouldnt
call
this
genre
defining
but
it
is
playing
a
useful
role
in
this
summers
beer
spectrum
at
first
this
beer
is
absolutely
creamy
and
fluffy
with
a
nice
body
that
tapers
off
and
the
crispness
is
left
to
carry
it
through
which
it
does
its
an
interesting
beer
although
its
a
bit
choked
back
like
most
of
the
other
magic
hat
beers
a
slight
touch
of
sourness
would
really
bring
it
into
focus
and
leave
it
more
drinkable
the
salty
aspect
reminded
me
of
dirty
bathtub
water
for
you
readers
out
there
with
kidsi
respect
the
experiment
and
like
the
low
abv
and
drinkability
but
i
doubt
that
id
have
this
again
if
it
wasnt
included
in
a
magic
hat
variety
12
pack
o
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
that
i
would
want
to
drink
again
there
just
wasnt
much
flavor
and
the
faint
flavors
that
were
there
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
had
three
of
these
in
the
magic
hat

buy
anymore
of
these
separately
great
artwork
saint
saltan
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
strongly
of
the
magic
hat
house
signature
yeast
with
a
bit
of
coriander
and
a
pinch
of
salt
the
taste
is
pretty
heavy
on
the
coriander
but
otherwise
tastes
just
like
magic
hats
single
chair
ale
with
just
a
hint
of
salt
on
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
light
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
one
of
the
more
average
brews
magic
hat
has
put
out
in
a
long
time
its
tasty
but
absolutely
nothing
special
and
beyond
the
slightest
hint
of
salt
theres
nothing
gosey
about
this
at
all
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
smell
is
yeasty
with
coriander
hints
of
bread
and
citrus
taste
is
grainy
coriander
yeast
with
the
salt
coming
in
at
the
end
and
staying
through
the
aftertaste
very
interesting
flavors
but
balance
out
well
a
smooth
well
carbonated
light
bodied
beer
overall
an
interesting
beer
good
flavors
and
a
nice
balance
worth
a
try
i
too
purchased
this
from
the
house
of
1000
beers
but
i
got
it
for
1
others
have
said
there
isnt
much
memorable
about
this
beer
and
i
would
agree
maybe
that
is
the
reason
i
like
it
so
much
just
a
beer
to
enjoy
ice
cold
right
from
the
bottle
and
not
feeling
the
need
to
remember
it
maybe
i
like
it
because
it
was
just
a
buck
what
a
disappointment
unrecognizable
saltiness
no
spices
and
where
is
the
lactic
acid
this
is
a
poor
example
of
a
gose
i
like
for
brewers
to
brew
out
of
their
comfort
zone
but
they
were
obviously
brewing
outside
of
their
capabilities
with
this
one
pass
not
half
bad
just
misses
the
mark
a
bit
more
me
still
a
decent
drink
the
patron
saint
of
gose
why
not
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
gold
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
coriander
sweet
biscuit
and
a
twinge
of
sweet
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
everything
has
congealed
into
a
characterless
mass
of
vague
wheatiness
and
sweetness
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
bland
meek
excuse
for
a
gose
one
that
comes
across
more
as
a
weak
pale
wheat
ale
than
anything
resembling
a
gose
shame
really
overall
very
enjoyable
would
be
great
as
a
summer
session
beer
o
a
little
to
clean
and
simple
for
me
its
almost
like
a
more
flavorful
bmctype
lager
im
sure
this
would
be
a
nice
easy
drinker
in
the
summer
but
its
still
a
little
too
cold
out
in
the
spring
to
get
the
most
enjoyment
out
of
this
overall
i
cant
say
it
was
terrible
but
if
i
wanted
a
german
wheat
beer
i
would
seek
out
a
witbier
over
this
offering
not
terrible
just
kind
of
forgettable
all
around
pretty
nice
simple
brew
i
cant
say
i
really
know
what
to
look
for
in
a
gose
but
i
wouldve
pegged
this
as
an
american
witbier
or
pale
wheat
if
i
didnt
know
better
kind
of
an
odd
offering
for
winter
but
pretty
enjoyable
overall
a
not
so
interesting
beer
yet
easily
sessionable
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
salty
some
grains
taste
is
also
salty
up
front
some
malts
and
grains
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
different
and
pretty
good
beer
