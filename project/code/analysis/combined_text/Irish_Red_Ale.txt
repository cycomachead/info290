cheers
odd
aftertaste
some
sort
of
spice
nice
irish
red
again
like
most
of
their
beers
dont
really
have
much
access
in
my
area
to
bad
because
its
very
nice
good
abv
around
6
percent
and
a
rich
malty
flavor
with
strong
hints
of
caramel
and
nuts
o
kind
of
blah
not
bad
certainly
not
great
amber
pour
with
a
nice
red
hue
very
nice
head
and
lasting
lacing
nose
is
of
toast
nut
and
caramel
sweet
malt
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavor
profile
is
a
laid
back
blend
of
malt
flavors
that
ends
up
being
nicely
complex
and
balanced
like
the
nose
toast
nut
and
caramel
float
over
a
slight
sweetness
the
finish
is
smooth
and
at
the
end
goldings
are
detected
a
solid
red
ale
this
was
a
huge
surprise
to
me
a
great
representation
of
the
style
so
simple
so
drinkable
a
really
representation
for
a
traditional
great
beer
pours
murky
caramel
brown
with
a
thin
1
finger
khaki
head
that
sits
for
a
minute
i
like
the
look
of
this
irish
red
more
than
others
ive
had
very
earthy
aroma
with
some
citrus
notes
of
orange
also
a
lot
of
sweet
wheat
bread
the
sweetness
carries
over
in
the
taste
most
of
the
citrus
is
gone
replaced
with
caramel
and
more
of
that
breadyness
mouthfeel
is
quite
wonderful
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
thirst
quenching
on
a
hot
day
i
am
always
weary
of
this
style
not
a
fan
by
any
means
this
however
i
like
a
lot
it
does
seem
more
of
a
american
take
on
a
irish
red
but
regardless
this
is
a
great
beer
i
have
found
the
thirsty
dog
brewery
to
be
somewhat
inconsistent
and
this
beer
is
certainly
one
of
their
better
choices
hop
presence
is
just
about
absent
but
theres
plenty
of
roasted
malt
caramel
butterscotch
and
nut
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
the
smell
is
sweet
and
the
taste
is
too
but
not
as
sweet
and
thats
a
good
thing
for
a
beer
with
a
relatively
thin
mouthfeel
and
modest
abv
for
the
style
the
flavors
are
bold
and
the
beer
is
relatively
complex
i
liked
the
malt
flavors
but
i
also
recognize
that
the
beer
could
be
better
with
more
hops
and
a
bit
less
sweetness
it
goes
down
easy
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
not
sticky
despite
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
its
just
a
touch
too
thin
this
isnt
bad
by
any
means
i
commend
thirsty
dog
for
taking
a
style
like
this
and
giving
it
a
real
dimension
for
fans
of
amber
ales
and
brown
ales
check
this
if
its
available
to
you
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
rich
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
crystal
and
biscuit
malts
it
has
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
with
a
mild
breadlike
character
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
crystal
malt
sweetness
with
a
dry
roasted
malt
finish
it
goes
down
incredibly
easy
with
tons
of
malt
character
yet
only
a
hint
of
residual
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
red
ale
it
appears
to
be
overly
complex
aroma
yet
it
stays
in
check
and
drinks
well
sweeter
flavor
than
the
smell
suggests
theres
a
berry
flavor
to
this
brew
again
theres
no
notable
hop
the
body
is
watery
with
a
high
level
of
fine
bubbles
so
it
isnt
too
soda
popish
overall
for
the
style
a
pretty
solid
beer
here
i
feel
like
irish
red
ales
can
only
be
so
good
and
thirsty
dog
has
brewed
a
good
one
d
again
not
my
style
but
one
of
the
better
ones
backin
the
home
team
this
one
is
pretty
good
was
in
cleveland
area
and
the
local
store
had
a
bunch
of
thirsty
dog
brews
so
i
made
my
own
six
if
you
know
what
i
mean
the
irish
setter
poured
a
clear
red
amber
with
sligthly
off
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
mostly
malt
on
the
nose
with
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
carried
a
caramel
malt
base
with
some
hop
balance
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
i
try
this
again
and
it
has
improved
ill
rereview
it
i
thought
this
red
was
highly
enjoyable
and
well
crafted
excellent
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
this
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
would
be
an
excellent
guzzling
choice
for
st
pattys
day
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
well
made
drinkable
beer
this
ones
not
bad
one
dimensional
but
rich
and
drinkable
o
wish
i
had
a
good
bottle
this
version
deserves
the
low
score
overall
again
i
find
another
great
beer
from
this
brewery
it
almost
makes
me
want
to
throw
the
4
bucks
down
to
try
the
cerberus
almost
aroma
is
of
light
caramel
roasted
nuts
light
touches
of
butterscotch
like
sugary
notes
warming
brings
out
a
very
earthy
and
pronounced
flavor
to
it
really
nice
done
but
a
touch
light
this
is
my
only
complaint
as
it
did
not
have
the
pop
i
was
really
looking
for
at
the
time
smooth
even
flavor
really
did
not
deviate
much
from
beginning
to
end
as
the
overall
impact
was
nicely
put
together
o
a
disappointing
irish
ale
a
little
bland
not
overly
medicinal
tasting
but
the
taste
is
definitely
there
i
had
this
on
tap
around
st
patricks
day
and
while
i
was
not
blown
away
by
it
i
seem
to
remember
liking
it
a
little
more
than
i
did
this
time
had
a
bottle
at
liberty
st
tavern
with
a
slice
of
pizza
overall
this
was
a
simple
and
smooth
red
ale
with
a
velvety
caramel
bread
character
and
medium
body
it
wasnt
too
thick
like
some
irish
reds
there
was
just
enough
balancing
bitterness
so
the
hops
werent
too
sweet
just
a
fine

like

pretty
to
look
at
theres
not

taste
to
this
beer
thats
not

still
worth
a
try

not
a
bad
beer
but
lacks
compared
to
some
of
the
bigger
more
flavorful
beers
later
on
in
the
tasting
rack
though
id
likely
go
for
a
pint
of
those
before
this
one
its
still
not
bad
as
a
session
beer
this
is
a
very
nicely
crafted
beer
with
just
a
bit
too
much
caramel
malt
sense
to
be
considered
a
top
offering
the
nose
is
definitely
caramel
malt
with
little
else
impressing
the
look
is
a
reddish
amber
with
an
ivory
head
and
decent
lacing
there
is
grain
in
the
finish
but
little
hop
sense
is
noticeable
creamy
with
too
little
carbonation
to
put
crispness
in
the
feel
good
effort
and
enjoyable
but
the
style
has
better
representatives
a
lot
better
light
amber
ale
with
noticeable
malt
flavor
very
red
color
and
sweet
carmel
aroma
light
carbonation
adds
to
the
sweet
flavoring
somewhat
lacking
in
flavor
to
be
memorable
though
described
as
medium
body
with
a
freshly
ground
caramel
malt
flavor
with
no
bitterness
that
was
the
problem
no
discernable
hopping
at
all
and
the
malt
was
too
bland
to
carry
the
beer
meh
is
the
best
possible
description
of
this
beer
not
as
good
as
i
remember
this
is
usually
a
very
short
release
so
if
you
want
it
you
have
to
get
there
fast
i
finally
got
myself
some
and
it
was
worth
it
very
smooth
and
drinkable
irish
red
a
better
beer
than
most
of
their
standards
overall
i
was
not
very
impressed
and
kind
of
saddened
since
pint
profits
go
to
local
firemen
and
i
only
got
a
sample
it
ok
overall
i
went
to
the
rock
bottom
in
cincinnati
though
because
its
a
chain
i
am
going
to
assume
the
beers
carry
over
the
same
i
ordered
a
flight
of
six
of
their
standard
beers
and
as
i
tried
each
one
i
found
that
each
was
spot
on
to
the
style
the
remarkable
thing
is
how
unremarkable
the
beers
are
dont
get
me
wrong
they
are
well
worth
the
try
and
certainly
above
average
but
they
are
produced
for
a
mass
market
so
as
lazy
as
it
may
be
i
am
going
to
simply
say
that
this
beer
was
a
text
book
example
of
the
style
without
breaking
out
and
setting
itself
above
paired
with
the
chicken
fried
chicken
i
love
me
some
chicken
fried
chicken
on
tap
at
the
westminster
location
an
appropriate
beer
for
st
pattys
day
the
pour
is
clear
brick
red
nice
and
dark
with
a
good
inch
of
off
white
foam
the
nose
is
surprisingly
complex
lots
of
floral
springtime
essences
and
an
orange
or
tangerine
citric
element
thats
uncommon
in
the
style
all
this
behind
a
sturdy
red
malt
body
and
a
biscuit
ale
yeast
the
flavor
is
identical
to
the
nose
but
with
the
orange
only
coming
out
after
its
swallowed
i
love
the
layers
here
and
it
feels
just
right
for
spring
its
an
easy
mug
to
get
through
with
a
medium
body
and
cruisy
carbonation
its
not
really
as
dry
as
advertised
but
who
cares
the
long
finish
allows
the
orange
and
flower
petal
thing
to
really
come
out
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
especially
for
a
chain
produced
red
ale
i
think
rock
bottom
is
pretty
impressive
for
a
chain
though
the
food
is
fantastic
and
the
beers
are
always
a
little
creative
also
proceeds
to
charity
for
this
one
so
props
for
that
enjoyed
at
rock
bottom
homestead
pa
poured
an
orangeamber
with
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
for
a
head
light
aroma
of
toasted
caramel
malts
nutty
not
much
in
the
flavor
department
nutty
somewhat
toasty
bready
a
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
but
nothing
really
distinctive
lightmedium
mouthfeel
and
after
one
mug
i
had
no
desire
to
have
another
overall
a
good
version
of
an
amber
ale
o
nothing
to
complain
about
with
this
beer
good
flavor
and
while
it
doesnt
blow
you
away
it
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
into
a
5
5
abv
beer
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
i
wish
they
served
it
here
at
home
i
will
definetly
try
and
get
my
hand
on
more
plus
it
supports
my
profession
and
it
was
being
used
as
a
fundraiser
for
indy
firefighters
which
made
it
even
better
i
am
all
about
the
charity
so
when
i
saw
that
there
is
a
combo
of
beer
and
charity
schwing
the
growler
came
from
rock
bottom
dtown
chitown
the
amber
color
was
very
nice
and
two
finger
white
head
gave
to
a
nice
lace
the
aroma
could
have
been
more
bit
was
a
nice
subtle
cross
between
malt
and
hop
the
taste
is
nice
and
caramelly
i
really
like
this
beer
and
could
session
all
day
long
on
tap
at
rock
bottom
downtown
indy
poured
a
very
nice
semideep
red
with
excellent
head
and
some
very
nice

slight
sugar
and

wonderful
taste
with
a
great

deepness
with
good
caramel
undertones
and
a
nice
crystal
malt
sweetness
decent
hop
finish
under
a
nice
tangy
maltiness
goes
down
extremely
smoothly
very
refreshing
and
cleansing
a
good
starter
beer
in
a
session
but
somewhat
neutral
with
some
of
its
flavors
considering
this
was
draft
fresh
in
a
well
sealed
growler
it
was
overall
slightly
above
average
pours
a
moderate
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
a

bready

a

slightly
roasted

character
alongside
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
a
bit
of
citrus
in
there
with
some
bitterness
following
along
drinks
fairly
well
and
the
lighter
malt
is
complemented
by
light
citrus
hopping
poured
hazy
deep
copper
color
with
an
average
frothy
offwhite

that
lasted

with
a
slick

and
soft
carbonation
medium
to
heavy
smooth
bittersweet
flavor
with
a
medium
bittersweet
finish
of
moderate
duration
this
is
a
very
good
beer
d
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
light
on
the
alcohol
well
balanced
and
plenty
of
hoppiness
smooth
and
light
in
flavor
for
an
amber
with
some
short
lived
malt
flavors
on
the
tongue
rather
thin
in
body
and
sports
excessive
carbonation
for
the
style
but
is
actually
befitting
of
the
beer
due
to
its
light
body
a
bit
drying
on
the
finish
keeps
the
drinkability
in
check
though
not
bad
if
only
due
to
the
light
body
d
a
decent
red
ale
but
a
bit
too
oaty
for
me
pretty
drinkable
though
d
very
nice
esb
with
lots
of
flavors
this
is
something
that
i
would
drink
all
night
and
would
love
to
try
cask
conditioned
nikki
this
years
version
is
noticeably
more
hoppy
and
less
smooth
than
i
remember
from
last
year
the
flavor
is
still
good
but
the
tartness
i
find
somewhat
offputting
sad
overall
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
was
a
little
crisp
not
too
heavy
d
drinkability
is
good
though
beer
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
d
this
beer
has
some
slightly
odd
flavor
with
the
tangy
notes
and
the
raw
grain
notes
at
the
end
left
kind
of
a
dull
flavor
in
my
mouth
after
each
sip
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
fingers
width
of
foamy
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
floral
hops
and
toffee
not
much
else
taste
is
of
floral
hops
with
a
nice
caramel
malty
backbone
earthy
finish
medium
in
body
good
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
complex
nice
that
proceeds
go
to
help
local
fire
departments
though
that
alone
is
worth
getting
a
pint
dont
drink
and
review
this
years
batch
is
hoppier
than
past
versions
the
brewer
stated
he

good

drank
pretty
easy
a
nice

bottom
line
good
beer
for
a
good
cause
i
also
picked
up
a
commemorative
pint
glass
like
many
of
rbs
beers
this
one
fails
to
wow
its
good
for
what
it
is
but
it
doesnt
make
me
want
to
order
another
not
a
bad
beer
and
certainly
drinkable
actually
very
sessionable
but
not
one
i
will
rush
back
to
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
good
carbonation
i
could
easily
drink
a
good
deal
of
this
brew
a
nice
session
beer
for
sure
really
toasty
and
worth
checking
out
i
hope
for
more
like
this
from
rb
warrenville
fire
chief
ale
is
definitely
in
the
bottom
half
of
all
the
offerings
that
ive
had
at
this
brewpub
over
the
years
since
its
a
beer
that
has
been
released
at
numerous
rock
bottoms
around
the
country
and
since
most
bas
dont
seem
overly
fond
of
it
i
wonder
if
the
recipe
was
predetermined
by
corporate
headquarters
better
to
let
the
local
brewmasters
unleash
their
creativity
at
least
then
thered
be
a
chance
at
good
beer
served
at
the
arlington
location
typcal
pint

colder
than
it
should
have
been
it
had
a
medium
reddish
brown
color
with
a
large
faomy
head
it
had
a
sweet
mildly
fruity
aroma
with
mild
hops
the
tatoh
sweet
and
roasted
it
had
a
mediocre
mouthfeel
with
a
good
balance
of
carbonation
sweetness
dryness
and
smoothness
it
was
however
very
drinkable
and
rather
refreshing
the
appearance
is
a
medium
browncopper
with
a
beige

mild
lacing
aroma
is
a
very
muted
hint
of

initial

a
gentle

but
not
as
sweet

few
hops
dry
and
mildly
carbonated
few

to
be

pleaser
i
know
the
brewmaster
john
and
his
standards
are
higher
he
is
planning
some
awesome
brews
for
the
coming
months
after
march
2006
stay
tuned
red
color
with
an
average
white
head
the
smell
was
nothing
special
basically
just
a
bit
of
malts
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
as
for
flavor
it
was
a
slight
hoppy
twang
up
front
and
a
bit
of
lighter
malty
sweetness
i
did
detect
a
slight
oxidized
or
metalic
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
standard
crisp
but
not
too
light
overall
i
didnt
really
see
anything
special
about
this
beer
drinkability
its
as
drinkable
as
any
okay
beer
but
considering
the
other
rb
taps
ill
save
my
growler
for
something
else
drinkability
very
sessionable
and
food
worthy
beer
nice
and
pleasant
overall
i
might
have
to
go
back
for
a
growler
of
this
served
at
rock
bottom
chicago
here
it
was
presented
as
an
irish
red
ale
and
i
dont
think
any
of
us
has
many
great
expectations
from
this
style
still
there
are
some
nice
roasty
malt
notes
and
a
noticable
hop
profile
in
an
attractive
red
body
a
decent
enough
session
ale
its
clear
deep
copper
body
has
an
orangeish
glow
to
it
and
its
creamy
tan
head
holds
well
before
dropping
to
a
thin
surface
covering
that
leaves
thin
splashes
of
lace
the
nose
is
caramelish
and
fruity
its
medium
body
is
accentuated
by
a
crisp
carbonation
that
gently
zests
the
tongue
and
wakens
the
tastebuds
in
the
flavor
a
juicy
berrylike
fruitiness
is
found
upfront
followed
by
a
carameltinged
toffeeish
malt
and
lightly
spicy
and
floral
hops
its
very
well
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
its
fruity
and
toffeeish
flavors
combine
brilliantly
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
like
this
one
as
much
as
i
did
but
i
just
had
to
have
a
second
pint
very
well
done
and
quite
drinkable
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
a
malt
forefront
and
a
hop
zing
as
the
finish
comes
on
and
the
malt
flavor
takes
a
break
the
hops
come
back
and
dance
on
the
tongue
to
wipe
the
caramel
and
bring
us
back
to
a
zing
for
the
next
sip
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
malt
scent
along
with
some
mild
aroma
hops
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
a
little
weak
in
the
malt
department
as
well
as
the
hops
department
this
is
supposed
to
be
an
american
pale
ale
that
usually
means
some
good
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
good
carbonation
this
is
like
most
of
their
beers
weak
and
made
for
the
masses
it
falls
short
on
style
deep
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
light
foam
lace
was
minimal
but
there
was
some
the
aroma
was
floral
and
mildly
malty
somewhat
earthy
taste
was
fruity
with
a
bittersweet
flavor
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
watery
sharp
tang
finish
that
disappeared
quickly
its
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
in
the
restroom
the
recipe
is
posted
centennial
willamette
and
mt
hood
i
dont
really
know
what
i
was
expecting
with
this
brew
i
was
just
happy
to
see
a
new
beer
on
the
menu
fire
orange
in
color
a
bit
hazy
and
topped
by
a
generous
head
the
aroma
is
mellow
and
hints
at
just
a
bit
of
spicy
hops
the
first
sip
brings
forth
a
smooth
rounded
brew
with
a
mild
maltiness
and
a
nice
bold
but
not
aggressive
bitterness
that
carries
through
in
the
finish
not
like
any
other
steam
beer
i
have
had
but
fairly
tasty
by
any
standard
very
drinkable
even
caught
on
with
some
of
my
beerwuss
buddies
to
be
honest
i
am
unsure
of
the
style
comments
elsewhere
on
the
web
imply
that
this
might
be
a
steam
beer
o
decent
red
and
certainly
drinkable
not
overwhelming
but
tasty
all
the
same
if
you
see
it
its
worth
a
try
for
sure
poured
ontap
at
the
dunedin
brewery
the
beer
was
served
in
a
pint
glass
and
it
pours
a
dark
ruby
coloring
with
a
slight
haze
the
color
has
some
brown
muddle
too
almost
opaque
there
was
a
thin
light
frothy
head
supersweet
toffee
and
caramel
aromas
with
a
little
roasted
character
too
caramel
and
tangy
sweet
toffee
with
roastytoasty
undertones
the
body
has
a
light
smoothness
to
it
the
tartness
gets
very
tangy
towards
the
end
there
is
a
slight
sourness
to
the
syrupy
sweet
aftertaste
the
finish
is
slightly
cloying
and
lingers
a
bit
certainly
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
irish
red
ale
just
needs
more
malt
complexity
in
aroma
flavor
and
a
toastierdrier
finish
to
compete
with
oharas
and
the
like
d
very
drinkable
i
crushed
this
one
in
about
5
minutes
overall
it
was
very
solid
a
very
nicely
done
and
quite
session
able
red
ale
a
notch
above
average
for
sure
d
as
with
the
pale
ale
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
a
couple
of
flavors
in
the
beer
are
a
bit
distracting
to
my
pallete
and
overall
it
misses
the
mark
from
me
interesting
to
try
a
couple
beers
from
this
brewery
back
to
back
the
similarities
are
strong
and
quite
noticeable
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
on
the
beach
but
not
terribly
compelling
i
feel
like
this
is
an
irish
red
ale
as
it
has
very
little
in
common
with
other
american
ambers
very
maltcentric
which
is
what
leads
me
to
the
irish
red
conclusion
overall
this
is
a
fine
red
ale
well
after
first
taste
i
felt
like
i
just
licked
a
rubber
band
strong
rubber
taste
to
this
one
this
was
the
second
dunedin
brewery
beer
that
we
have
tasted
and
i
think
its
safe
to
say
that
it
will
be
the
last
no
current
plans
on
swinging
by
that
brewery
on
my
next
trip
to
tampa
not
saying
that
i
could
brew
better
but
i
probably
could
this
won
an
several
awards
too
honestly
i
would
hate
to
have
gone
to
the
beer
competition
where
this
won
an
award
seriously
how
bad
were
the
beers
there
i
was
once
told
by
a
young
woman
that
once
you
go
red
youll
wanna
go
to
your
bed
yah
i
might
want
to
do
that
and
go
to
sleep
hopefully
forget
about
this
beer
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
deep
enough
this
was
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
maybe
at
the
brewery
next
time
d
this
is
an
ok
brew
this
is
a
very
drinkable
if
not
complex
amber
the
flavors
are
fairly
subdued
and
there
is
an
eversoslight
sour
twinge
that
takes
away
from
things
a
little
bit
again
on
tap
at
the
brewery
a
nicely
poured
pint
reddish
tan
of
course
with
a
light
tan
med
thick
head
little
strength
in
that
head
though
average
lacing
good
aroma
mainly
sweet
malts
the
taste
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
presentation
again
mainly
a
med
sweet
malt
flavor
lacking
the
hop
finish
that
would
have
made
this
beer
still
drinkably
just
a
only
slighty
better
that
average
red
ale
crisp
mouthfeel
that
dries
the
mouth
a
smidge
tastes
a
tad
like
metal
as
the
scent
hints
at
some
sweet
caramel
bumps
that
out
of
the
way
quickly
though
also
some
toasted
bread
crust
and
bready
malts
in
there
as
well
not
a
bad
brew
drink
is
ok
nothing
fantastic
but
with
that
burnt
caramel
taste
i
really
didnt
want
to
have
another
one
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
aside
from
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
this
is
an
atypical
red
ale
not
too
much
going
on
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
at
all
freshness
may
be
an
issue
but
as
i
didnt
purchase
this
from
the
brewery
i
cant
be
sure
i
didnt
buy
this
from
one
of
my
regular
stores
so
im
not
sure
how
long
its
been
on
the
shelf
i
found
this
to
be
a
darkcolored
pour
for
an
amber
the
freshness
is
inviting
a
sweet
nose
above
the
constant
bubbles
a
delicious
spiciness
thanks
to
the
hoppy
finish
a
great
amber
both
in
presentation
and
taste
i
might
need
to
make
a
trip
to
the
brewery
for
one
on
tap
other
comments
a
lively
bubbly
brew
with
a
gorgeous
color
its
a
bit
raw
tasting
though
if
that
makes
any
sense
this
one
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
left
me
wanting
another
one
average
drinkable
brew
overall
an
ok
local
beer
that
i
had
a
few
times
while
in
florida
it
could
use
a
little
more
hopping
for
my
like
but
hey
its
still
a
solid
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
that
is
well
rounded
if
a
bit
too
sweet
poured
a
very
hazy
coppery
orange
with
huge
rocky
foam
that
died
down
a
little
but
leaves
minimal
lace
smells
of
bright
slightly
sour
strawberry
and
cranberry
with
plenty
of
grains
and
a
little
alcohol
taste
is
growing
on
me
the
more
i
drink
with
a
berry
fruited
lightly
sweet
overtone

a
well
bodied

pretty

for

unique
balance

notes

a
pretty
well
done
ale
with
a
drinkable
taste
im
certainly
feeling
the
mystery
alcohol
level
so
its
worth
noting
pours
a
murky
brick

with
a
full

head
that
yields
a
decent
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
almost
birch
tree
like
with
metallic
aromas
and
a
good
amount
of
malt
not
too
enjoyable
some
citrus
in
the
nose
as
well
which
is
dominated
mostly
by
lemon
zest
that
weird
birch
flavor
returns
with
a
very
spice
like
almost
cinnamon
zing
to
it
a
dominate
caramel
malt
arises
and
overtakes
the

completely

brings

not
in
a
good
way
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try

for
a
bottle
very
tasty
malty
flavored
red
ale
poured
an
amber
brownish
hue
with
a
nice
offwhite
two
fingered
head
not
over
carbonated
and
very
refreshing
decent
malt
smell
followed
by
some
mild
hop
tones
smooth
and
rather
roasty
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
hop
tone
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
medium
bodied
brew
that
goes
down
very
easy
enjoyable
and
certainly
drinkable
drinkability
not
bad
id
drink
this
again
but
given
the
choice
id
probably
pick
their
pale
ale
i
cant
understand
why
dunedin
sends
their
beers
out
so
highly
carbonated
this
beer
has
a
fair
amount
of
fruity
sweetness
to
it
up
front
a
combination
of
malt
sugars
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
berry
like
fruit
character
immediately
following
this
is
a
buttery
note
of
diacetyl
that
really
only
becomes
noticeable
as
the
beer
is
leaving
my
mouth
but
does
linger
on
quite
a
bit
in
the
finish
this
is
certainly
not
a
diacetyl
bomb
at
least
compared
to
some
i
have
had
but
it
dominates
the
finish
and
ultimately
the
experience
of
this
beer
it
likely
would
not
be
noticeable
to
those
not
sensitive
to
diacetyl
up
front
i
really
like
the
soft
lightly
sweet
berry
note
if
the
diacetyl
was
reigned
in
this
could
become
a
nice
introductory
amber
ale
red

red
ale
pours
a

thin
white

from
a

sixteen
ounce

the
aroma
is
pleasant
but
very
mild
hops
the
taste
is
pleasant
hoppy
the
label
says
its
delicately
hopped
with
willemette
and
east
kent
goldings
id
say
its
a
hoppy
beer
but
not
double
ipa
hoppy
so
i
guess
by
west
coast
standards
it
might
be
delicately
hopped
an
enjoyable
beer
buyer
beware
when
purchasing
this
stuff
nothing
prettier
than
a
red
in
a
20
oz
pint
glass
aroma
is
a
mix
malty
caramel
smells
with
a
whiff
of
hops
i
found
this
to
have
a
nice
if
light
body
the
flavor
hits
the
spot
with
sweet
caramel
followed
by
a
light
hop
finish
this
is
a
smooth
one
that
would
make
a
very
nice
session
ale
interesting
aged
example
of
a
local
beer
which
has
developed
some
over
time
the

is
full
of
sediment

drinkable
red
interpretation
no
flaws
mouthfeel
was
the
worst
part
of
this
brew
thin
and
watery
but
theres
enough
froth
to
make
it
decent
and
not
unpleasing
overall
fairly
drinkable
and
light
but
a
bit
too
bitter
and
watery
to
have
too
many
not
bad
per
se
but
neither
is
it
good
drinkability
very
good
only
had
a
pint
so
im
not
sure
how
they
would
go
down
in
large
quantities
but
would
love
to
find
out
very
good
amber
ale
on
tap
at
the
lost
kangaroo
in
bradenton
fl
a
bit
bland
this
one
reddish
orange
tending
toward

similar
taste
very
lightly
hopped

scratchy
going

a
bit
watery
always
good
to
support
the
local
brews
but
this
one
is
a
bit
disappointing
a
good
score
from
the
sunshine
state
red
head
red
ale
is
a
different
sort
of
red
ale
it
starts
out
promisingly
but
is
unable
to
finish
and
is
therefore
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
dunedin
beers
that
ive
had
so
far
even
so
thanks
to
bierreise
for
the
bottle
this
was
my
first
try
of
beer
from
the
dunedin
brewery
but
it
shall
not
be
my
last
a
nice
thich
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
beer
has
a
reddish
amber
color
to
it
almost
like
the
head
on
a
rootbeer
float
aroma
is
a
light
malty
scent
with
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
to
it
beer
has
a
reddish
amber
color
to
it
there
is
a
easy
bitterness
with
a
malt
sweetness
at
the
finish
that
makes
this
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
nose
of
sweet
malts
flavor
that
is
nicely
balanced
from
the
malts
with
enough
bittering
to
keep
the
sweetness
in
line
very
light
fruitiness
move
forward
in
the
finish
medium
body
is
smooth
to
a
fault
decent
drinkability
from
this
ale
from
the
masterbrewer
of
dunedin
the
score
is
an
attempt
to
combine
both
reviews
above
a
little
thin
but
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
irish
red
ale
and
one
that
doesnt
lack
in
flavor
i
highly
recommend
getting
this
brew
a
spectacular
looking
brew
perfect
clarity
with
more
than
enough
suds
on
top
fresh
toasted
bread
spicy
rye
faint
toffee
woody
hops
in
the
aroma
lush
crispness
smooth
creamy
body
lots
of
malt
to
wade
in
some
caramel
then
some
spicy
rye
all
meld
very
well
clean
palate
throughout
quick
smack
of
hop
bitterness
keeps
this
ale
in
check
some
pretty
stellar
drinking
here
sessionable
as
it
grows
on
me
sip
after
sip
we
have
a
winner
here
a
big
thanks
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
pretty
deep
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
if
of
caramel
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
well
balanced
caramel
malts
some
hops
tasty
and
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
fine
beer
and
disappearing
quickly
poured
a
red
body
with
decent
head
and
lace
and
the
aroma
is
bland
as
i
get
touches
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
but
not
too
much
really
going
on
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
the
same
as
the
beer
is
light
smooth
minimal
hops
add
some
but
not
complete
balance
and
the
beer
is
just
an
easy
drinking
caramel
and
toffee
sweet
malt
mess
that
isnt
bad
but
not
something
i
want
again
once
the
crack
was
heard
i
sped
the
rabbit
on
his
way
with
an
inverted
glug
the
pseudocascade
was
perfect
and
resulted
in
a
finger
of
tawny
head
that
quickly
dissipated
leaving
some
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
the
color
was
a
deep
copperyred
srm

and
looked
like
the
hair
color
of
a
former
girlfriend
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
filtration
but
this
was
filamentbright
adding
to
the
overall
appearance
of
the
beer
nose
had
a
light
grassiness
to
accompany
the
biscuity
maltiness
and
i
found
this
odd
for
an
irishstyle
red
as
i
usually
think
of
them
as
being
quite
malty
where
this
was
more
subdued
actually
in
reading
up
on
it
this
was
well
within
spec
for
the
style
exhibiting
a
caramel
maltiness
in
the
mouth
with
just
a
hint
of
the
grassiness
that
i
noted
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
i
found
myself
drinking
through
it
quite
quickly
easydrinking
beer
may
be
a
cliche
but
i
am
unabashed
in
using
it
in
this
instance
the
finish
was
semisweet
but
just
about
right
for
my
tolerance
of
sweet
beers
its
relatively
low
abv
would
make
it
a
good
candidate
for
the
cooler
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
creamy
tan
head
head
has
some
nice
retention
but
no
lacing
aroma
is
caramel
malt
fruit
and
some
earthy
hops
the
taste
follows
right
along
with
the
aroma
and
mirrors
it
closely
in
fruit
and
hops
notes
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
but
not
bad
a
tasty
red
ale
poured
straight
into
a
large
tulip
style
glass
dark
amber
with
hints
of
orange
and
a
one
and
half
finger
head
which
quickly
goes
down
to
a
one
finger
head
which
in
turn
dissipates
down
to
a
very
light
froth
covering
the
surface
of
the
beer
nose
is
all
sweet
caramelly
amber
malt
roasted
grains
warm
bread
pudding
a
touch
of
milk
chocolate
a
hint
of
minerality
and
some
sweet
floral
notes
from
the
hops
altogether
its
a
sweet
crisp
clean
inviting
nose
and
thoroughly
appropriate
for
the
style
front
of
the
tongue
sees
tart
sweetness
while
the
midpalate
sees
a
lovely
expansion
of
the
sweet
malty
flavors
including
roasted
grain
and
sweet
bread
notes
dark
cherry
blood
orange
and
mildly
tart
apple
back
of
the
tongue
sees
a
surprising
and
wellplaced
hop
bitterness
and
a
surprising
and
very
subtle
sense
of
lighterroast
berry
forward
fresh
coffee
the
finish
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
bitter
and
sweet
and
is
very
light
on
the
palate
which
reflects
the
surprising
lightness
of
this
beer
overall
this
style
is
not
supposed
to
be
terribly
complex
it
is
meant
as
a
session
beer
and
this
one
is
certainly
sessionable
both
in
flavor
and
lower
abv
unlike
some
other
irish
reds
the
malty
sweetness
never
becomes
cloying
or
heavy
and
the
balancing
hop
bitterness
is
wonderfully
executed
you
may
have
dozens
even
hundreds
of
better
beers
this
year
but
you
might
not
find
a
better
take
on
the
irish
red
ale
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
nice
everydaysession
type
beer
different
a
little
bit
of
a
spin
on
the
style
not
bad
o
nice
malt
profile
well
balanced
solid
amber
a
basic
but
decent
beer
that
is
unpretentious
and
a
highly
quaffable
rendition
of
this
style
o
this
is
a
really
nice
effort
from
db
good
representation
of
the
roastytoasty
malts
with
a
good
dose
of
caramel
and
a
good
crisp
hop
schedule
with
light
citrus
herbal
and
floral
components
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
and
pretty
sessionable
as
not
too
sweet
grain
over
caramel
to
give
solid
maltiness
without
too
much
sweetness
i
really
liked
this
its
definitely
more
of
an
irish
red
now
and
should
probably
be
reclassified
as
such
with
notes
of
caramel
butter
toast
and
firm
hop
bitterness
that
gives
this
just
enough
of
a
refreshing
crispness
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
and
not
get
bored
without
research
i
dont
know
who
this
reilly
is
but
apparently
he
likes
reds
and
probably
redheads
too
but
then
who
doesnt
this
brew
pours
a
clear
orange
amber
topped
by
a
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
whitish
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
hoppy
citrus
and
some
white
biscuits
the
taste
is
similar
but
the
caramel
notes
are
watereddown
the
hops
melt
into
a
bland
floral
bitterness
and
a
strange
mintyness
i
think
thats
how
to
describe
it
creeps
in
as
well
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
crisp
semidry
finish
overall
a
rather
average
red
but
its
nice
to
see
new
things
popping
up
down
here
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
and
yes
you
guessed
it
that
can
reached
my
hand
by
way
of
the

pretty
deep

present
caramel
very
refreshing
and
smooth

overall
a
very
easy
drinking
beer

i
could
consume

mo
aug
8th
2014
d
this
was
a
decent
irish
red
ale
nothing
exciting
but
very
traditional
scent
and
taste
and
body
it
had
a
clean
and
mellow
finish
so
it
was
really
easy
to
drink
not
bad
to
try
once
but
i
prefer
something
more
interesting
o
refreshing
enough
but
i
did
not
dig
the
foam
geyser
this
a
simple
yet
tasty
beer
the
smell
was
a
bit
off
but
didnt
detract
from
the
overall
beer
too
much
i
put
this
baby
in
gear
with
a
squirting
crack
and
employed
an
inverted
glug
producing
a
massive
three
fingers
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
excellent
retention
color
was
indeed
a
deep
brick
red
srm

hey
who
am
i
to
argue
plus
it
works
as
a
calibrator
with
nequality
clarity
the
cascade
hops
were
prevalent
on
the
nose
and
allow
me
to
plug
hops
by
stan
hieronymous
printed
by
the
brewers
association
it
is
a
brilliantly
written
tome
and
very
helpful
for
this
nonbrewing
hophead
warming
i
was
also
getting
a
toastlike
smell
probably
from
the
roasted
barley
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
not
bad
but
not
great
either
forget
that
the
taste
was
great
since
the
hops
were
forward
which
is
a
knock
that
i
usually
have
with
the
usually
maltdriven
style
it
had
a
grassy
mintiness
along
with
a
light
biscuit
flavor
just
right
for
this
baby
bear
finish
was
closer
to
semidry
than
semisweet
and
i
was
cantacting
my
friends
for
more
i
really
dug
this
twist
on
the
style
and
would
certainly
cansider
it
for
inclusion
in
my
cooler
poured
ontap
at
the
tap
house
and
served
in
a
shaker

the
beer
is
a
caramel
brown
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
filmy
white
coating
of
head
nose
of
roasted
nut
caramel
and

very
rich

flavors
are
rich
and
roasted

forward
with
a
subtle
resinous
hopped
backbone
chocolate
notes
into
the
aftertaste
to
join
the
toffee
caramel
and
nut
with
a
building
bitterness
to
balance
rich
smooth
bodied
with
a
sweet
linger
into
a
smooth
finish
good
beer
o
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
i
am
impressed
most
irish
reds
ive
had
have
been
poor
attempts
and
cant
even
touch
this
beer
on
a
complexity
level
this
beer
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
aroma
and
alcohol
and
delivers
it
in
a
nice
little
aluminum
package
for
you
well
done
the
feel
is
smooth
lightly
carbonated
and
a
bit
thick
but
well
presented
for
a

i
had
an
old
review
id
had
on
tap
and
i
liked
this
one
i
dont
know
if
the
recipe
changed
or
it
doesnt
sit
well
in
the
can
but
this
isnt
what
id
remembered
reddish
amber
in
the
duvel
tulip
with
a
modest
but
persistent
foam
plenty
of
hoppy
flavors
give
this
a
bitter
middle
that
intensifies
in
the
aftertaste
the
nutty
roasted
flavors
are
what
give
it
some
zest
i
score
this
highly
because
its
a
superior
example
of
a
really
dull
category
of
beer
from
the
12
oz
can
purchased
at
whole
foods
in
washington
dc
taste
was
easily
near
the
top
of
any
red
ale
ive
ever
had
the
pour
was
not
near
as
smooth
as
i
would
normally
like
but
the
flavor
made
it
easy
to
forgive
the
foam
after
the
can
opened
pretty
interesting
take
and
a
memorable
brew
for
the
style
quite
different
than
most
irish
ales
ive
had
every
single
fing
can
in
this
sixpack
has
overflowed
from
the
pour
spout
upon
cracking
resulting
in
a
stupidly
overfoamed
pour
the
beer
does
have
a
nice
amber
color
though
under
that
ridiculous
head
the
obnoxiously
overflowing
pour
also
filled
the
area
with
lovely
beer
aromas
of
cereal
grains
lemon
pith
and
a
clean
yeastiness
in
the
flavor
sweet
caramel
malts
are
subdued
by
an
earthy
dry
somewhat
roasty
bitterness
but
it
all
comes
through
just
a
bit
thin
the
light
texture
has
some
substance
and
energy
providing
a
fine
complement
to
the
flavor
profile
overall
the
overflowing
cans
pissed
me
off
but
after
my
rage
subsided
i
had
to
acknowledge
that
this
beer
is
quite
nice
o
ive
had
three
of
these
on
different
days
to
see
if
my
impression
changed
but
this
is
one
i
wont
be
buying
again
i
had
high
hopes
for
it
but
it
just
doesnt
work
for
me
interesting
beer
i
like
the
taste
where
that
earthtea
flavor
really
shines
and
the
sweetness
adds
a
lot
of
complexity
to
it
overall
4

this
is
pretty
interesting
to
me
its
got
a
really
awesome
roasted
flavor
to
it
but
then
finished
with
the
familiar
hop
crunch
perfect
carbonation
levels
the
appearance
is
quite
nice
too
except
the
lacing
it
out
of
control
its
like
an
insulating
lining
on
my
glass
o
a
well
above
average
red
here
the
deep
toasted
character
courtesy
of
the
roasted
malt
adds
a
great
underlying
complexity
to
the
sweet
caramel
pleasantly
interesting
for
the
style
drinks
well
o
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
and
it
hides
the
abv
pretty
well
i
enjoyed
the
hoppiness
but
still
found
it
relatively
easy
to
drink
nothing
exceptional
but
a
better
american
offering
in
the
irish
red
ale
style
than
i
normally
come
across
a
decent
tasting
beer
maybe
a
little
much
on
the
hints
of
burnt
malts
but
i
like
how
the
dryish
aftertaste
keeps
building
long
after
each
drink
a
dark
copper
colored
brew
with
a
healthy
offwhite
head
and
major
walls
of
lacing
the
aroma
brings
sour
mash
malt
a
little
pine
hop
and
fruit
nougat
and
a
touch
of
grassy
yeast
alcohol
the
flavor
closes
the
deal
with
deep
grassy
malt
cider
theres
a
vague
floral
edge
slightly
perfumey
vegetable
ideas
it
has
some
bocklike
qualities
a
little
skunky
a
very
solid
red
ale
easily
recommended
with
medium
body
and
a
dry
feel
smooth
and
modestly
carbonated
nice
certainly
not
standard
among
the
irish
reds
i
have
sampled
in
the
past
but
definitely
tasty
and
interesting
o
i
do
like
this
beer
and
i
think
will
you
too
there
might
be
better
irish
ales
out
there
but
i
feel
that
one
cannot
go
wrong
with
the
aviator
hod
rod
red
enjoy
i
am
very
proud
to
say
this
irish
red
ale
is
brewed
only
15
minutes
down
the
road
from
me
nothing
is
over
the
top
concerning
this
style
of
beer
every
flavor
has
been
crafted
just
right
i
want
to
see
some
six
packs
soon
i
bought
this
beer
because
they
are
a
local
brewery
from
down
the
road
i
like
some
of
their
other
stuff
but
this
is
just
awful
o
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
but
doesnt
particularly
separate
itself
from
the
herd
the
only
better
irish
red
is
glbc
conways
overall
this
is
what
i
imagine
when
i
imagine
an
irish

try
and
gets
the
job
done
i
think
i
will
go
drink
one
now
on
cask
at
the
wooden
nickel
served
in
a
slim
pint
glass
a
crisp
dark
amber
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
crisp
citrus
hops
in
front
of
burn
caramel
malts
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
burnt
caramel
malts
and
citrus
hops
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
quite
smooth
this
is
a
great
cask
beer
as
a
result
the
drinkability
is
good
but
not
great
a
decent
enough
sessionstyle
beer
and
a
good
take
on
one
of
my
less
than
favorite
styles
easy
drinker
and
hides
its
slightly
higher
than
average
abv
well
overall
probably
the
best
red
ale
ive
had
which
granted
doesnt
say
too
much
but
i
liked
this
beer
would
order
it
again
and
it
gets
me
excited
to
try
more
from
aviator
so
mission
accomplished
nice
flavors
for
an
irish
red
with
hints
of
english
hops
and
malts
this
really
strikes
me
as
something
that
might
be
had
at
an
english
inn
rather
than
an
irish
pub
just
the
same
its
solid
and
clean
nice
brew

decent
red
ale
certainly
highly
drinkable
but
neither
is
it
among
garrisons
better
brews
still
when
its
consumed
within
sight
of
the
harborfront
it
adds
a
certain
something
to
the
experience
overall
good
but
not
amazing
i
tried
one
of
these
while
on
a
vacation
to
their
brewery
in
halifax
in
august
2012
compared
to
the
few
reds
ive
had
this
was
a
pretty
pedestrian
offering
nothing
offensive
yet
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
found
myself
wishing
id
ordered
something
else
instead
and
thats
kind
of
disappointing
overall
a
standard
irish
red
by
garrison
it
hits
the
mark
on
some
of
the
styles
traits
such
as
dry
finish
and
tealike
flavour
but
otherwise
does
not
offer
much
else
new
o
one
of
my
more
enjoyable
garrison
brews
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
but
not
lacking
to
much
character
d
decent
flavor
probably
my
least
favorite
so
far
by
garrison
but
still
enjoyable
overall
i
liked
this
light
and
refreshing
with
nice
hints
of
fruit
d
maybe
not
a
session
beer
but
could
definitely
enjoy
a
couple
this
darker
amberred
ale
pours
with
a
light
skimming
of
a
head
an
aroma
of
nutty
malts
and
earthy
hops
both
stick
out
very
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
noted
in
the
glass
but
it
is
more
noticeable
on
the
tongue
a
sharp
bite
i
find
this
to
be
an
irish
dry
red
if
that
is
even
a
category
as
that
is
how
it
leaves
my
mouth
sticky
also
overall
a
typical
beer
for
the
price
and
for
what
i
was
expecting
o
overall
a
tasty
red
ale
with
some
esb
characteristics
worth
a
try
but
nothing
spectacular
sweet
and
somewhat
generic
doesnt
really
stand
out
for
the
style
an
irish
ale
with
an
identity
problem
it
maintains
the
big
enjoyable
oldschool
malt
base
but
the
other
offflavours
at
times
push
the
lowrent
local
brew
boundaries
still
easy
enough
to
drink
i
suppose
but
certainly
not
all
night
the
red
has
a
smooth
finish
and
i
could
see
this
being
drinkable
this
was
not
one
of
my
favorite
irish
reds
by
any
stretch
but
it
is
still
a
decent
beer
if
it
was
my
university
years
again
a
pitcher
of
this
for
me
would
be
just
fine
at
the
pub
pretty
drinkable
bottle
poured
a
light
redamber
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
dry
caramel
malt
with
light
cereal
notes
and
some
residual
sugar
taste
is
also
dominated
by
dry
caramel
malt
with
light
sweet
notes
and
no
discernible
hops
body
is
a
bit
light
with
ok
carbonation
decent
but
a
bit
too
bland
to
be
truly
interesting
even
as
a
session
beer
d
not
terrible
but
not
very
smooth
the
odd
things
about
this
beer
likely
wont
make
me
buy
it
again
not
the
best
red
ale
ive
had
but
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
either
thanks
again
long813
for
this
one
yet
another
worthy
beer
from
the
other
side
of
canada
yep
this
is
infected
mouthfeel
is
overly
carbonated
taste
is
pretty
foul
with
rotten
fruit
and
cherries
still
some
chocolate
in
there
but
yea
this
is
a
pretty
nasty
bottle
shitty
really
on
my
end
since
id
have
to
travel
2000
miles
just
to
get
another
bottle
very
dissapointed
but
all
the
other
garrison
brews
i
had
were
terrific
so
cant
get
too
mad
about
one
bad
apple
not
many
microbreweries
offer
an
irish
red
and
even
less
offer
a
good
irish
red
i
had
forgotten
just
how
respectable
this
style
can
be
when
put
in
a
capable
brewers
hands
garrison
makes
a
number
of
solid
beers
in
styles
much
more
exciting
than
this
yet
i
think
the
irish
red
may
just
be
my
favourite
of
the
bunch
thanks

at

smells
of
fresh
cut
wood
balsa
possibly
and
some

coming
through
good
steady
low

thin

seems
out
of

with

minimalist

regenerated

with

overall
a
beer
with
good
refreshment
value
thats
just
a
bit
intriguing
as
well
poured
with
a
nice
little
head
but
it
died
pretty
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
smelled
decently
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
but
also
a
bit
of
lemon
tea
which
seems
to
be
common
for
the
garrison
beers
ive
tried
so
far
the
taste
followed
suit
and
while
its
nothing
exciting
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
solid
and
balanced
mostly
sweet
maltycaramel
flavour
with
a
sort
of
tart
bitterness
partly
citric
and
partly
coffeeish
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
was
fine
would
not
be
hard
to
make
this
into
a
session
beer
its
not
a
complex
beer
at
all
but
overall
its
an
easydrinking
and
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
plenty
of
thick
sweet
head
head
stuck
around
for
a
while
and
left
minor
lacing
on
the
glass
scent
consists
of
some
sweet
malts
which
match
the
taste
some
roasty
flavors
at
the
end
as
well
as
a
somewhat
creamy
taste
somewhat
muted
but
very
drinkable
overall
one
of
my
favorite
garrison
brews
note
after
having
got
this
one
from
the
maritimes
i
was
able
to
try
another
sample
at
beerfest
now
is
readily
available
in
calgary
i
will
definatley
have
this
one
again
rich
chestnut
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
tan
head
definitely
looks
the
part
laces
quite
well
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
malts
along
with
a
light
fruitiness
nice
light
caramel
flavour
with
decent
levels
of
breadiness
and
fruit
in
the
background
mediumlight
body
and
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
good
for
the
style
garrisons
website
has
a
fair
bit
of
info
on
all
their
beers
but
i
was
surprised
to
see
they
labelled
the
bitterness
as
low
for
this
beer
it
certainly
stands
out
for
me
still
fairly
drinkable
just
wish
i
could
of
had
a
clean
sample
perhaps
another
day
notes
very
conservative
brewing
for
a
microbrew
nothing
wrong
with
conservative
but
you
have
to
hit
the
marks
if
you
go
for
an
easy
drinking
brew
and
this
one
misses
so
far
im
dissapointed
in
the
local
offerings
a
night
out
at
taps
located
downtown
hopefully
will
change
my
mind
overall
taste
is
mostly
mellow
with
a
light
cramel
and
fruit
sweetness
lots
of
malty
sweetness
and
a
definite
peppery
bite
cellarlike
damp
eath
flavour
comes
through
as
well
and
a
light
floral
note
theres
a
bit
of
acidic
sourness
to
balance
it
out
a
bit
or
else
i
think
it
might
be
too
sweet
but
its
not
bad
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
light
dryness
slides
down
quite
easily
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
and
a
sessionable

to
boot

peter
far
better
than
the
garrison
brown
or
amber
ales
still
one
dimensional
but
an
all
malt
ale
with
subtle
falvor
and
good
drinkability
arrives
at
my
table
a
brilliantly
clear
and
bright
red
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
that
is
reasonably
well
retained
and
leaves
some
lacing
for
the
first
half
of
the
pint
smell
is
bright
and
fruity
will
notes
of
strawberry
apricot
and
pear
dominating
the
malty
profile
taste
is
similar
with
a
very
fruity
base
and
little
hop
bitterness
to
balance
its
sweet
and
malty
nature
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
but
still
decent
and
with
nice
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
good
not
a
bad
offering
this
beer
is
ok
but
it
lacks
the
malt
dimension
of
the
brown
ale
and
has
more
of
the
off
flavors
kind
of
like
mediocre
homebrew

unpasteurized

the

dissipates
aromas

ale
reminds
me
of
something
i
would
have
been
really
into
about
10
years
ago
but
today
its
just
ok
o
weak
the
taste
is
like
the
nose
in
that
toasted
bready
malts
and
butter
kick
in
right
off
but
there
is
a
low
to
moderate
earthy
bitterness
hanging
around
at
the
end
to
add
just
the
slightest
bite
easy
to
drink
but
pretty
ordinary
poured

a
copper

some

and
a
lot
of

malty

taste
is
slightly
below
average
but
its
close
enough
to
a
3
crisp

flavors
slight
sweet
fruit
notes
and
a
hint
of
yeast
its
not
bad
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
mouthfeel

overcarbonated
and
dry
again
give
it
a
try
but
dont
seek
out
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
muddled
copperyellow
coloring
with
a
frothy
white
small
bubbled
foam
of
head
about
half
an
inch
tall
aromas
are
light
and
smooth
with
a
light
sweetness
atop
some
toasty
and
bready
tones
flavors
are
offbalance
a
bit
with
a
decent
strong
roasted
caramel
malt
backbone
and
some
subtle
fruit
highlights
overpowering
any
of
the
toasty
and
biscuity
qualities
that
were
present
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
light
to
the
point
of
watery
in
mouth
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
overly
rewarding
the
aftertaste
is
cloyingly
sweet
with
a
slight
floral
twist
the
finish
is
a
bit
watery
and
leaves
a
slight
film
behind
like
i
said
its
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
better
beers
worth
your
time
and
focus
out
there
od
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
this
was
actually
one
of
the
better
one
i
have
tried
from
this
style
sweet
and
simple
less
coarse
than
other
irish
reds
i
have
had
nowhere
near
bad
poured
a
pretty
1
5
custard
head
with
decent
lasting
power
the
body
is
a
clear
radiant
orangy
amber
which
doesnt
exactly
look
like
an
irish
red
ale
to
me
but
it
still
looks
nice
theres
not
much
smell
just
some
malt
the
taste
has
malt
its
creamy
and
a
little
sweet
body
is
pretty
light
weight
this
strikes
me
as
a
decent
everyday
workhorse
beer
alternative
to
bmcs
aroma
is
of
light
caramel
roasted
nuts
light
touches
of
butterscotch
like
sugary
notes
warming
brings
out
a
very
earthy
and
pronounced
flavor
to
it
really
nice
done
but
a
touch
light
this
is
my
only
complaint
as
it
did
not
have
the
pop
i
was
really
looking
for
at
the
time
smooth
even
flavor
really
did
not
deviate
much
from
beginning
to
end
as
the
overall
impact
was
nicely
put
together
a
bit
light
on
the
feel
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
somewhat
smooth
it
does
feel
pleasant
but
there
is
a
lingering
aftertaste
that
was
a
little
tough
but
a
decent
beer
mouth
feel
was
ok
taste
lingers
on
tongue
like
most
of
the
wachusett
beers
ive
tasted
drinkable
but
not
delicious
pours
a
nice
clear
brownish
red
has
a
mild
foamy
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
has
a
mild
bitter
taste
with
a
hint
of
lemon
a
faint
hoppy
aroma
this
seems
to
a
balanced
brew
that
doesnt
overpower
in
any
one
area
nicely
carbonated
has
a
nice
zesty
feel
to
it
looks
good
mostly
clear
amber
in
colour
with
a
solid
half
inch
of
light
beige
foam
a
bit
sticky
with
good

retention
malty
aroma
a
little
toasty
and
buttery
slightly
metallic
pretty
much
the
same
in
the
flavour
low
bitterness
kind

in
the

the
body
was
fine
up
front
but
fell
away
at
the
end
medium

i
definitely
felt
that
this
beer
had
a

this
beer
had
enough

drinkability
nice
sweet
sessionable
bready
flavor
that
is
barely
above
average
for
the
style
this
one
is
pleasant
to
drink
but
does
not
jump
out
the
way
some
other
beers
from
this
brewery
do
d
i
wrote
blech
which
pretty
much
sums
it
up
im
glad
i
only
bought
the
single
d
a
decent
beer
follows
the
form
for
an
irish
red
but
not
a
stand
out
ale
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
an
offwhite
color
relatively
decent
retention
and
slight
lacing
left
on
the
sides
the
nose
is
very
weak
almost
no
scent
at
all
there
is
a
touch
of
breadiness
and
pale
malts
but
other
than
that
not
much
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
also
very
blase
but
a
little
more
to
it
than
the
nose
starts
off
with
a
malt
flavoring
slightly
sweet
slightly
bready
touch
of
hops
but
not
enough
or
well
blended
to
work
well
off
the
malt
and
sweetness
medium
bodied
beer
decent
carbonation
but
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
to
it
overall
its
drinkable
but
i
would
certainly
pick
something
different
its
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
really
stood
out
nonthing
fancy
but
another
solid
new
england
beer
it
makes
love
living
in
a
region
thats
so
prone
to
brewing
its
own
beer
and
doing
it
well
again
even
though
this
beer
is
nothing
to
shout
about
its
something
that
i
would
buy
again
should
the
appropriate
situation
arise
in
terms
of
company
this
beer
poured
a
coppercolor
with
a
twofinger
head
the
smell
is
caramel
and
toasted
malt
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
slightly
grainy
sweet
caramel
taste
that
gives
way
to
a
metallic
taste
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
a
some
crisp
carbonation
im
not
a
fan
of
the
metallic
taste
but
this
isnt
a
horrible
beer
this
is
very
mild
for
being
an
irish
red
ale
i
would
like
a
bit
more
flavor
and
body
to
follow
this
style
of
beer
i
will
not
seek
this
brew
out
again
i
never
choose
this
style
to
be
honest
drinkability
good
irish
red
with
nice
complexity
high
carbonation
may
limit
how
much
you
would
want
but
very
tasty
and
seemingly
low
abv
may
it
quite
drinkable
im
not
a
big
fan
of
irish
reds
so
i
need
to
preface
any
review
with
that
disclosure
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
typically
reddish
in
color
with
some
sweet
malty
caramel
aromas
with
the
red
fruity
aromas
typical
of
the
style
the
taste
is
malty
caramely
a
bit
flat
tasting
some
cloying
sweetness
and
the
very
typical
copperishreddish
flowery
taste
of
the
irish
red
ales
nothing
new
in
this
beer
it
is
very
typical
of
the
style
nothing
more
nothing
less
its
okay
im
not
a
big
fan
im
moving
on
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
irish
ale
light
bodied
smooth
feel
but
slightly
thick
at
the
end
leaves
a
light
film
smooth
drinker
its
good
and
balanced
the
hops
and
malt
are
both
bitter
but
also
flowery
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
not
the
best
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
keep
drinking
for
an
evening
the
beer
pours
a
goldenlight
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
fruitysour
yeast
aroma
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
aroma
the
taste
is
not
very
good
it
has
a
real
yeasty
flavor
that
overpowers
the
weak
malt
bill
it
seems
almost
past
its
prime
the
malt
bill
is
simple
and
consists
of
pale
and
light
crystal
malts
hops
are
faint
and
probably
english
noble
varieties
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
the
worst
beer
wachusett
makes
its
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
one
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
more
of
a
lighter
copper
color
than
an
amber
a
thin
wispy
white
head
atoptoasty
aromas
along
a
touch
of
butter
and
caramel
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
but
quite
crisp
it
went
down
quite
wellquite
toasty
a
lightly
sweet
and
caramelly
with
a
hint
of
mineral
a
basic
amber
here
not
much
hop
presence
but
it
drinks
easy
this
tasted
different
from
the
quinns
i
remember
a
few
years
back
when
it
was
labeled
as
an
irish
style
ale
rather
than
an
amber
ale
if
the
formula
has
been
tweaked
in
the
process
it
has
not
been
to
the
overall
benefit
of
the
product
this
used
to
be
my
favorite
wachusett
seasonal
it
now
seems
to
be
more
of
an
average
decent
product
but
one
with
no
special
appeal
to
cause
a
followup
purchase
pours
a
golden
amber
fluffy
headwith
good
retentionand
lacing
body
is
light
to
mediumand
carbonated
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
nicebut
weak
taste
is
roastedand
sweet
with
a
bit
of
hop
in
the
finish
im
not
all
that
famliar
with
this
stylebut
this
is
a
refreshing
good
flavored
brew
i
would
try
it
again
d
really
easy
to
drink
refreshing
but
still
has
a
substantial
amount
of
flavor
for
a
lightbodied
brew
ill
have
more
of
these
notes
this
beer
has
lost
something
over
the
years
very
pedestrian
and
certainly
does
not
stand
above
any
of
the
traditional
irish
reds
d
eeeh
mouthfeel
has
a
strong
chewy
body
that
exhibits
easy
drinking
smoothness
with
mellow
carbonation
this
one
goes
down
easy
a
well
built
ale
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
more
often
thanks
to
muddyfeet
and
bif20
for
this
one
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
with
caramel
malts
throughout
each
sip
a
nice
hop
presence
helps
balance
this
beer
out
wachusett
brewery
biscuit
and
bready
flavors
in
there
too
the
feel
on
the
palate
is
very
soft
and
with
syrupy
malts
not
one
of
my
favorite
style
but
now
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
brews
for
the
style
pours
a
clay
color
like
infield
dirt
with
a
big
foamy
head
and
lots
of
lace
aroma
is
malty
with
hops
very
faintly
in
the
background
flavor
was
very
sweet
malts
and
hints
of
some
sort
of
nut
chestnut
perhaps
kind
of
an
earthy
feel
to
the
whole
flavor
made
me
think
of
a
foggy
morning
mouthfeel
is
pretty
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
finishes
very
crisp
very
smooth
to
drink
and
tough
to
put
down
nice
if
brief
hops
at
the
front
then
disappearing
evaporating
fading
along
with
the
body
begins
medium
then
bottoms
out
malt
dominated
crisp
on
the
palate
but
disappointing
after
the
hoppy
introduction
a
passable
irish
ale
for
the
punters
in
the
crowd
the
label
for
this
one
calls
it
an
amber
ale
not
an
irish
though
but
alas
not
grabbing
me
overall
a
decent
brew
easy
to
drink
heres
an
okay
beer
with
the
slightly
off
aroma
aside
this
is
a
very
nondescript
brewneither
offensive
nor
interesting
worthy
of
a
taste
but
perhaps
not
a
six
pack
this
ale
poured
a
clear
amberred
color
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
was
malty
and
only
lightly
hoppy
with
notes
of
caramel
overall
the
flavor
was
mellow
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
smooth
but
with
a
crispness
it
had
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
but
it
is
a
decent
easy
drinking
not
overly
complex
beer
clear
copper
appearance
pale
yellow
head
creamy
in
texture
lasts
at
14

just
over
a
minute
spare

spicy

light

astringency
with
some

flavor
starts
easy
going
but
oddly
slick
a
fruity
sense
with
some
pear
flavors
honeyish
as
well
keeps
its
texture
but
the
flavor
pans
out
to
mildly
watery
mid
mouth
the
hops
could
step
up
to
the
plate
more
as
well
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
i
was
picking
up
weird
aftertastes
something
like
parmesan
cheese
good
appearance
and
start
decent
overall
drinkability
the
close
was
a
little
off
for
me
thanks
to
liza
p
for
bringing
a
bottle
back
from
a
short
easter
break
in
rhode
island
this
was
an
amber
beer
topped
by
a
bit
of
fluffy
whiteness
that
died
quickly
lightly
fragrant
i
found
a
bready
maltiness
to
chew
on
amid
the
fine
bubbles
with
the
clean
bitterness
in
the
hops
i
could
have
a
couple
more
very
nice
pint
glass
presentation
fluffy
offwhite
head
on
deep
goldenbrown
brew
malt
outpowers
the
hops
a
bit
on
this
one
but
they
have
obviously
worked
hard
to
get
both
constituents
in
balance
for
this
brew
in
preparation
for
their
prime
st
patricks
day
window
of
sales
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
all
great
on
this
brew
and
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
for
a
withdinner
beer
enjoy
better
than
average
considering
i
caught
this
at
the
edge
of
its
lifespan
bleh
some
caramel
malt
notes
are
the
highlights
here
low
carbonation
and
zero
reason
to
go
for
more
then
a
few
sips
pass
this
one
by
032013
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
on
tap
very
enjoyable
as
the
first
of
the
day
it
went
down
all
to
easy
may
have
another
before
days
end
the
body
is
medium
and
this
wouldnt
work
as
well
as
a
classic
irish
style
if
it
was
much
heavier
its
got
lots
of
depth
but
what
really
impresses
me
is
a
clean
and
robust
balance
against
an
incredibly
silky
smoothness
that
coats
the
tongue
without
slickness
and
flows
like
silk
impressively
it
doesnt
give
up
crispness
for
all
the
smoothness
overall
youd
be
pretty
nuts
not
to
seek
this
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
u
s
craft
beer
and
love
irish
reds
i
had
it
with
some
bbq
tempeh
mashed
potatoes
and
broccoli
and
it
was
the
perfect
pairing
this
beer
is
proof
that
american
brewers
can
do
cool
things
with
fairly
standard
styles
without
resorting
to
mondo
hopping
or
zany
flavors
would
drink
again
fairly
standard
amberred
ale
not
as
dry
as
most
which
is
nice
decent
flavors
but
boring
overall
a
good
pick
and
solid
ale
taste
comes
off
the
same
with
light
tones
and
smooth
sweetness
very
easy
drinking
and
laid
back
and
even
a
bit
watery
at
times
not
the
best
amber
ever
but
still
a
decent
brew
i
love
red
beer
and
this
one
is
pretty
good
the
best
quality
was
its
appearance
which
was
beautifull
the
smell
and
taste
were
okay
nothing
spectacular
in
general
but
a
great
beer
to
bring
by
to
drink
with
friends
instead
of
bringing
millers
or
buds
o
nothing
special
but
still
and
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
beer
could
definitely
be
sessionable
since
it
has
a
moderate
abv
and
an
easy
to
enjoy
flavor
had
this
for
the
first
time
in
appelebees
it
was
their
guest
beer
of
the
month
i
like
irish
reds
and
this
was
very
good
to
excellent
on
the
first
glass
smooth
with
a
caramelbutterscotch
taste
it
was
easy
to
put
a
few
down
quickly
i
made
a
special
trip
to
the
brewery
in
riverhead
where
greg
showed
me
around
and
indicated
that
they
were
going
to
be
bottling
shortly
from
their
riverhead
location
i
cant
wait
this
ale
tastes
great
light
im
a
big
amber
fan
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
i
know
ambers
dont
get
a
lot
of
love
on
this
site
but
if
you
like
the
style
id
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
if
you
see
it
very
well
balanced
and
just
gives
me
that
caramel
malt
flavor
that
i
crave
from
time
to
time
when
im
all
hopped
out
o
a
solid
and
enjoyable
effort
from
the
local
folks
i
would
try
this
on
tap
if
i
came
across
it
had
a
sample
from
this
brewery
almost
a
year
back
and
remembered
enjoying
it
so
i
took
the
opportunity
to
try
it
again
when
seen
on
tap
close
to
a
finger
head
on
a
caramelreddish
body
the
smell
is
of
caramel
butterscotch
with
the
taste
leading
there
also
with
a
tealike
flavor
the
body
is
very
light
with
light
carbonation
which
makes
the
for
a
crisp
refreshing
character
a
pleasant
lighter
beer
polishing
off
a
32oz
growler
at
the
mo
reppin
strong
island
in
a
real
good
way
with
a
decent
appearance
this
isthe
second
time
ive
had
a
growler
fill
of
this
brew
and
its
a
solid
sessionable
brew
definitely
lighht
carbonation
and
good
mouthfeel
throughout
bold
flavor
with
slight
bitterness
great
with
food
poured
a
deep
reddish
color
bordering
on
brown
little
head
little
lacing
smelled
no
hops
muted
malts
tasted
those
malts
and
maybe
some
caramel
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
the
best
parts
of
this
red
ale
for
me
smooth
mouthfeel
slight
carbonation
clean
finish
way
drinkable
at
5
this
is
a
very
relaxed
sessionable
brew
d
decent
the
mouthfeel
and
alcohol
content
are
easy
enough
on
your
palate
to
throw
a
few
of
these
back
the
taste
just
doesnt
keep
me
coming
back
overall
i
like
it
irish
red
is
a
style
that
i
feel
is
underrepresented
and
thought
id
give
it
a
try
when
i
caught
it
on
tap
im
glad
i
did
i
would
definitely
give
this
a
go
and
ill
be
looking
for
their
other
beers
in
the
future
overall
a
good
and
servicable
ale
d
this
one
is
extremely
drinkable
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
which
makes
it
go
down
easy
but
the
flavor
is
nice
and
subtle
and
it
leaves
my
mouth
feeling
cool
i
could
easily
throw
several
of
these
back
it
went
down
easy
so
i
had
another
sample
picked
up
a
growler
direct
from
the
contract
brewer
in
connecticut
this
one
shows
a
dark
maple
color
with
a
fair
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
simple
sour
apple
caramel
malt
pretty
sharp
upon
the
first
mouthful
this
is
somewhat
thin
an
aqueous
finely
carbonated
ale
which
somewhat
resembles
a
sweet
brown
ale
i
also
pick
up
some
smoke
but
the
dominant
taste
is
tart
rhubarb
and
sour
brown
sugar
at
first
it
seems
too
sour
almost
like
its
over
ripe
but
as
you
get
through
the
first
pint
it
mellows
and
the
sweetness
blends
in
a
bit
more
and
you
get
the
nutty
brown
ale
qualities
and
always
a
touch
of
smoky
wood
drinkability
is
good
it
grows
on
you
worth
a
try
surprised
by
the
fizz
of
it
but
a
good
beer
i
would
drink
again
respectable
red
a
local
go
to
for
me
when
in
doubt
o
ok
but
nothing
special
a
passable
red
that
is
drinkable
o
the
malt
profile
this
beer
has
is
very
interesting
and
combined
with
the
earthy
woody
hop
flavor
underneath
im
a
fan
however
the
carbonation
from
this
bottle
was
out
of
control
and
made
it
more
filling
then
it
needed
to
be
pairing
best
with
hot
wings
i
advise
against
nachos
jalapeños
overpower
the
beer
yet
the
wings
did
not
o
it
was
alright
average
beer
for
an
average
price
i
guess
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
but
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
for
o
overall
a
pretty
good
red
but
theres
better
out
there
overall
i
was
surprised
by
the
flavor
of
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
typical
amber
ale
its
very
good
its
not
far
off
from
a
wine
cooler
though
when
all
is
said
and
done
its
a
nice
red
beer
for
a
cool
fall
day
but
there
are
many
better
reds
out
there
enjoyed
at
the
brewery
single
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
clear
amber
body
caramel
and
toasted
malts
with
light
strawberry
and
herbal
aroma
notes
flavor
is
plain
and
undermalted
with
a
slight
earthy
and
herbal
hop
note
lighter
body
than
expected
for
the
style
and
moderate
carbonation
many
of
these
brews
are
boring
and
undermalted
expecially
the
red
ales
brewery
is
nearby
i
look
forward
to
sampling
a
few
dragonmeade
beers
fresh
hard
to
get
excited
for
this
beer
some
off
flavors
going
on
here
but
they
seem
to
be
intended
glad
i
just
have
the
one
bottle
light
mouthfeel
with
a
tangy
finish
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
but
an
interesting
spin
on
a
red
ale
overall
this
is
a
fine
but
maybe
undistinguished
red
ale
it
sort
of
cements
dragonmead
in
my
mind
as
a
fine
but
maybe
undistinguished
brewery
with
the
exception
of
final
absolution
overall
refreshing
and
much
more
flavorful
than
expected
for
the
style
good
pouring
brilliant
redamber
hue
not
too
much
head
great
aroma
has
a
distinct
heavy
smell
some
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
bite
very
refreshing
one
of
the
best
darker
beers
ive
had
for
the
summer
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
quite
dry
but
still
fresh
tasting
clean
finish
almost
a
lemonbitter
aroma
at
the
finish
it
was
there
and
now
it
is
gone
dnot
a
bad
tasting
beer
overall
but
just
too
over
the
top
with
the
carbonation
this
brew
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
deep
amber
with
a
slight
head
after
a
fairly
aggressive
pour
that
dissipates
quickly
definitely
not
aromatically
challenged
i
get
a
very
pleasant
mellow
malt
essence
with
a
tinge
of
sweet
it
has
a
good
meaty
scent
to
it
but
its
not
piercing
my
nostrils
already
it
seems
balanced
and
tasty
and
thats
coming
from
my
nose
the
taste
is
nice
dry
crisp
light
to
the
sense
yet
packed
with
maltflavored
goodness
its
a
fine
mix
as
some
ambers
pack
on
the
flavor
and
the
density
whereas
this
brew
almost
drinks
like
a
lager
but
yet
has
plenty
of
girth
to
back
it
up
as
an
irish
ale
i
love
how
theres
a
hint
of
sweet
and
a
slight
bitterness
yet
its
almost
like
they
mask
each
other
theres
a
breadyness
to
the
taste
that
allows
each
flavor
to
blend
and
create
its
own
taste
the
aftertaste
is
a
nice
lingering
malt
sensation
it
hits
the
back
of
my
throat
in
a
refreshing
way
and
sits
there
until
the
next
sip
i
get
a
nice
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
a
hazy
amber
pourwith
two
fingers
of
soapy
white
head
aroma
of
bread
toasted
malt
and
herbal
hops
flavor
is
sort
of
a
toasty
pinynuttyand
herbal
hopsmedium
sweetness
a
sweet
honey
type
finish
thin
mouthfeelkind
of
a
watery
body
drinkable
but
nothing
special
d
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
was
not
good
the
fruitiness
i
noted
reminded
me
of
young
homebrew
love
to
try
this
on
tap
and
see
if
that
helps
with
the
conditioning
weak
body
weak
flavor
still
looking
forward
to
try
more
from
these
guys
though
this
beer
is
unlike
the
few
other
irish
reds
ive
had
in
fact
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
scottish
ale
but
i
suppose
they
can
be
fairly
similar
while
it
had
a
standard
red
with
white
head
appearance
the
aroma
and
flavor
especially
came
off
as
dry
thin
caramel
malts
with
some
bready
flavor
mixed
in
the
yeast
seemed
to
add
a
creamy
note
as
well
but
the
malts
carried
this
beer
tasty
and
drinkable
worth
trying

mouthfeel
is
nice
good

good

and
very

a
great
irish
red
i
would
order
again
poured
a
dark
reddish
copper
with
minimal
head
it
really
didnt
have
much
smell
to
it
at
all
so
i
was
especially
surprised
with
the
flavor
of
this
ones
it
had
a
pretty
strong
flavor
with
a
very
sweet
finish
which
i
believe
was
honey
it
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
i
will
want
to
definitely
try
again

moderate

with

feel
not
bad
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
dragonmead
brews
maybe
its
because
i
havent
had
an
irish
red
in
a
while
but
i
like
this
one
more
than
i
expected
to
if
erik
the
red
irish
style
amber
ale
is
representative
of
what
dragonmead
has
to
offer
im
looking
forward
to
the
handful
of
other
singles
that
i
was
able
to
find
on
my
recent
trip
through
southern
michigan
on
tap
at
ashleys
in
ann
arborpoured
from
the
tap
into
a
standard

almost
no

sweetness
and
firm

almost
a

flair
going
on
a
very
faint

shows
thru
in
the
finish
eh
it
was
ok
it
is
what
it
is
a
malty
red
with
a
thinner
mouthfeel
d
very
drinkable
i
could
have
one
of
these
almost
hourly
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
my
favorite
dragonmead
thus
far
unfortunately
the
beer
with
my
name
but
not
hair
color
has
got
some
work
to
do
this
brew
had
a
nice
red
color
presentation
but
low
carbonation
and
no
head
to
speak
of
forget
about
lacing
smell
was
sort
of
herbal
and
whisky
like
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
taste
was
bland
and
kind
of
boring
with
only
minimal
amounts
of
malt
mouthfeel
was
weak
and
flat
not
a
real
good
beer
maybe
i
got
it
on
a
bad
day
or
something
id
try
some
other
offerings
first
inoffensive
easy
drinking
boring
had
way
worse
but
wont
purchase
again
very
good
smooth
beer
a
little
bitterness
not
much
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
and
more
than
one
solid
pull
off
the
shelf
draught
pour
in
a
branded
glass
in
my
local
village
pub
appearance
is
a
dark
rubyred
with
a
creamy
head
it
smells
fruity
hoppy
and
with
hints
of
caramel
taste
is
balanced
not
too
sweet
or
too
bitter
and
feels
great
going
down
not
too
heavy
but
also
not
too
light
with
a
light
not
bitter
caramelly
aftertaste
overall
his
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
do
a
blacksmith
when
i
want
to
transition
to
a
heavier
stout
can
drink
this
all
evening
i
like
the
green
label
with

better
truly
an
enjoyable
alternative
to
the
run
of
the

alternatives

super

beer
it

the

feels

down
not
much
smell
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
being
poured
from

overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
not
spectacular
exceptional
or
even
great
but
its
a
very
very
good
solid

forward
slightly
sweet
ale
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
12

a
lasting
off

and
plenty
of
spotty

of

with
hints

and
refreshing
the

is
medium

abv
session
ale
pours
dark
reddish
brown
tiny
head
taste
mild
bitter
after
taste
i
think
this
glass
would
taste
better
if
it
was
not
served
so
cold
after
the
glass
set
and
got
just
a
little
bit
warmer
it
tasted
more
smooth
to
me
this
sets
the
standard
for
irish
red
ale
it
is
dry
balanced
and
has
a
wonderful
aftertaste
ive
tried
other
red
ales
that
aim
for
a
bolder
flavour
but
smithwicks
is
consistently
enjoyable
overall
it
is
also
well
priced
for
an
imported
beer
this
is
a
goto
for
me
any
it
is
in
heavy
rotation
for
st
pattys
day
celebrations
great
in
the
line
and
it
shows
it
is
the
standard
in
my
opinion
pours
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
decent
head
retention
the
smell
had
some
hops
to
it
but
also
what
seemed
like
cooked
rice
and
little
bit
of
oak
the
flavor
was
a
little
underwhelming
with
most
of
the
flavor
being
in
the
aftertaste
the
beginning
has
a
bit
of
bread
flavor
while
finish
has
a
bit
of
hop
bite
that
lingers
not
bad
but
nothing
great
either
the
flavor
follows
with
those
flavors
as
the
beer
is
generally
malty
cereal
grain
and
a
decent
body
lacking
in
flavor
and
then
a
cornlike
flavor
comes
in
a
slightly
metallic
finish
dark
red
almost
brown
smell
is
yeast
toasty
caramel
malt
light
mouthfeel
no
head
light
carbonation
sweet
taste
but
not
in
a
good
way
i
did
not
like
this
being
from
ireland
i
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
light
enough
to
guzzle
all
night
and
not
have
a
banging
head
the
next
morning
tip
if
in
ireland
ask
for
a
smithwicks
with
a
guinness
head
an
irish
red
ale
that
predates
arthur
guinnesss
famous
brew
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
that
contains
both
a
sweet
and
bitter
taste
at
the
same
time
with
a
fruity
aroma
ideal
for
those
heavy
sessions
when
you
dont
want
a
massive
hangover
this
beer
deserves
more
credit
in
my
opinion
on
the
once
a
year
i
drink
irish
beer
i
prefer
this
or
a
black
and
tan
depending
on
my
mood
its
decent
just
as
the
ratings
indicate
but
nothing
outstanding
surprisingly
low
alcohol
in
this
one
probably
done
that
way
on
purpose
so
you
can
have
several
of
them
at
a
time
pours
a
deep
brown
amber
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
foamy
head
that
stays
around
for
a
white
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malts
and
floral
hops
for
the
most
part
a
bit
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
some
roasted
malts
toffee
and
slightly
nutty
flavor
in
the
mix
also
slight
bitter
aftertaste
that
lingered
a
bit
more
than
i
would
like
overall
it
was
ok
i
had
my
first
smithwicks
while
in
divinity
school
last
summer
its
dark
full
bodied
flavor
was
the
perfect
beverage
for
the
peppered
venison
tenderloin
i
sizzled
up
for
supper
on
several
occasions
this
is
a
smooth
nonbitter
manly
brew
o
solid
for
the
style
enjoyed
note
the
bottle
looks
like
the
one
posted
for
the
superior
irish
ale
but
this
one
clearly
says
premium
overall
this
ale
taste
like
an
american
adjunct
lager
with
a
touch
more
malt
up
front
not
bad
just
boring
i
was
expecting
much
more
this
is
a
fairly
light
sessionable
and
refreshing
beer
but
with
a
good
deal
of
flavor
nothing
special
but
nothing
overbearing
or
offputting
just
an
all
around
good
beer
bought
as
part
of
a
six
pack
for
about
8
50
on
sale
at
hennessey
market
in
uptown
butte
believe
it
or
not
this
is
a
fairly
rare
beer
to
find
in
these
parts
eric
o
an
ok
beer
with
little
character
drinkable
but
disappointing
this
was
an
okay
beer
i
poured
a
dales
pale
ale
through
it
and
it
tasted
better
tell
you
a
story
about
this
my
brother
was
in
ireland
and
his
wife
ordered
a
guiness
draught
when
it
came
my
brothers
turn
he
said
he
would
like
a
smithwicks
draught
the
publican
looked
at
my
brother
then
at
his
wife
and
said
so
the
wife
is
having
the
mans
beer
and
himself
is
having
the
lady
guiness
that
about
sums
it
up
clear
dark
amber
pour
with
a
dark
ruby
cast
average
head
and
lace
retention
the
nose
is
slight
and
has
a
slightly
burnt
aroma
nice
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
slight
burnt
malt
off
flavor
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
effervescence
and
the
burnt
off
flavor
lingers
if
you
want
a
red
ale
get
an
excellent
one
like
green
flash
hop
head
red
overall
a
nice
and
well
balanced
session
ale
one
of
my
favorite
beers
at
my
place
of
work
we
have
it
on
draft
which
definitely
creates
a
better
experience
it
pours
a
very
pleasant
copperred
and
has
a
sweet
malty
aroma
its
sweet
aroma
transitions
nicely
into
a
semi
sweet
flavor
that
makes
for
a
very
easy
drink
i
remember
really
relishing
in
this
beer
before
i
discovered
craft
brews
not
so
much
now
this
one
pours
a
handsome
copper
red
hue
with
a
generous
white
head
and
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
malty
but
unfortunately
in
the
way
of
a
mass
produced
beer
the
flavor
is
light
and
sweet
and
refreshing
but
yet
again
carries
the
taste
of
the
use
of
inferior
grainsi
e
corn
its
a
good
beer
and
better
than
typical
lawnmower
beers
but
not
by
much
now
sold
with
the
modernized
red
label
pours
dark
amber
with
a
2
finger
offwhite
head
decent
carbonation
with
malty
and
slightly
skunky
aroma
taste
is
metallic
bitterness
then
turns
malty
and
sweet
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
slight
grittiness
finishes
off
typical
of
mass
produced
brews
good
but
nothing
stands
out
smithwicks
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
head
there
is
a
rather
stale
and
weak
aroma
but
with
some
malty
notes
the
taste
is
a
bit
wet
but
has
a
sharp
malt
backbone
weaker
flavors
but
still
there
overall
its
a
decent
red
ale
looks
good
and
the
taste
isnt
bad
overall
like
a
lot
of
longstanding
european
brands
smithwicks
has
kind
of
been
outpaced
by
modern
craftier
takes
on
the
style
still
its
a
very
reliable
beer
and
i
cant
see
myself
every
turning
one
down
especially
on
an
early
spring
day
when
its
getting
greener
outside
and
stoutandsnow
season
is
fading
more
malt
backbone
than
expected
the
bitterness
is
a
little
overly
done
the
metallic
character
is
offputting
esters
are
a
little
odd
as
well
this
is
really
rather
lackluster
to
me
this
is
the
beer
to
get
when
there
are
no
other
options
because
bud
and
miller
stuff
at
the
gas
station
the
smell
is
so
faint
and
the
taste
is
just
barely
there
but
enough
to
tell
its
a
red
ale
barely
i
confess
im
not
big
on
this
style
i
probably
wouldnt
ever
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
however
yes
it
is
drinkable
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
scent
is
of
hops
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
malts
the
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
hops
malts
and
caramel
the
overall
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
good
and
it
was
very
well
balanced
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
drink
it
again
poured
a
clear
amber
red
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
receded
to
a
white
ring
leaving
abundant
lacing
down
the
glass
pretty
good
for
the
style
scents
of
skunked
hops
caramel
toasted
malt
and
slight
nutty
aromas
not
the
best
scent
in
the
world
but
not
bad
for
a
red
ale
flavors
of
toasted
malt
caramel
some
grainy
malt
and
moderate
levels
of
floral
hops
throughout
with
some
slight
nuttiness
the
finish
is
semidry
and
toasty
with
a
toasty
aftertaste
not
bad
not
extremely
complex
but
good
for
a
session
ale
the
toasted
nutty
and
caramel
flavors
are
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
not

for
a
session
ale
quite
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
decent
session
ale
nothing
bad
about
it
but
nothing
amazing
its
still
a
good
enough
offering
id
have
it
again
overall
i
recall
having
this
on
tap
about
a
year
ago
and
it
was
a
very
solid
beer
revisiting
it
reminds
me
that
while
a
good
beer
there
really
is
nothing
exceptional
and
would
look
to
other
offerings
in
the
future

i
know
i
like
it
overall
an
impressive
beer
that
i
would
like
to
indulge
in
a
couple
pints
of
without
having
to
worry
about
whether
or
not
its
considered
craft
or
not
its
an
acceptable
irish
ale
better
than
most
imports
these
days
and
thats
good
enough
for
me
to
spend
my
hard
earned
dollars
overall
a
very
basic
beer
the
taste
doesnt
put
me
off
but
there
also
isnt
anything
in
the
flavour
that
i
would
call
really
likeable
or
enjoyable
if
someone
bought
this
for
me
in
a
bar
id
drink
it
but
this
is
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
myself
there
are
other
ambers
that
i
think
are
much
better
it
smells
like
a
bar
though
it
smells
like
a
typical
commercial
massproduced
beer
i
wonder
if
they
have
changed
the
recipe
either
way
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
there
are
way
too
many
other
brews
out
there
with
more
satisfying
flavor
than
purchasing
this
import
from
6000
miles
away
california
is
full
of
average
grade
brews
and
good
ones
too
poured
to
a
bubbly
head
very
airy
with
moderate
lacing
and
retention
had
a
rich
ruby
color
with
a
mild
malt
toffee
aroma
taste
was
a
mild
caramel
toffee
back
with
some
malty
notes
up
front
dry
finish
was
a
light
almost
watery
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
drink
had
not
had
in
a
while
and
is
not
a
good
as
i
remember
it
being
nice
deep
copper
appearance
with
a
tall
thick
head
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
are
understated
and
fairly
flat
the
flavor
is
the
high
point
but
it
isnt
anything
extraordinary
it
tastes
kind
of
like
a
very
light
guiness
i
supposed
definitely
not
a
summer
beer
perhaps
best
on
a
very
cold
december
night
in
ireland
the
smithwicks
did
not
overwhelm
lovely
color
but
comparatively
bland
overall
from
smell
to
mouthfeel
just
short
of
interesting
paired
with
oysters
on
the
half
shell
and
the
beer
definitely
could
not
stand
up
to
cocktail
sauce
might
be
ok
as
a
pure
pub
beer
with
low
expectations
very
smooth
ale
hints
of
caramel
fruit
malt
sweat
honey
smoke
very
easy
to
drink
if
its
on
tap
and
i
am
in
the
mood
why
not
is
one
of
my
top
go
to
beers
if
nothing
else
is
on
tap
i
feel
like
and
when
you
go
to
an
irish
bar
down
the
street
from
my
house
and
you
dont
like
guinness
this
is
one
of
the
best
alternatives
i
love
to
drink
my
setting
and
this
will
do
just
fine
for
my
irish
bars
go
groggs
when
i
brew
my
irish
ale
this
is
the
benchmark
i
use
the
beer
is
amber
hued
with
a
thin
tan
head
honey
and
fruit
notes
bread
and
biscuit
character
with
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
pretty
easy
to
drink
unexciting
but
inoffensive
thin
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
ok
overall
a
little
above
average
its
worth
a
try
and
is
quite
sessionable
more
of
a
drinking
beer
than
one
you
mull
over
probably
wont
purchase
again
as
there
are
plenty
of
better
beers
and
styles
for
the
same
price
or
cheaper
a
decent
unpretentious
beer
that
doesnt
go
anywhere
as
far
as
distinctive
flavors
go
it
also
seems
a
little
watery
still
a
good
thirst
quencher
especially
if
youre
not
looking
for
hop
or
malt
bombs
great
in
appearance
rich
dark
brown
little
weak
on
smell
but
pleasant
tasted
a
little
watery
going
down
but
after
taste
is
medium
left
you
wanting
a
bit
more
bite
but
still
wanting
another
drink
lacked
that
tightening
sensation
of
the
checks
and
tongue
that
dark
beers
give
light
on
the
hops
i
guess
but
ok
over
all
its
a
good
beer
does
not
have
an
over
powering
alcohol
taste
like
the
ipas
not
that
there
is
any
wrong
with
an
ipa
try
it
you
will
like
it
bottoms
up
i
tried
this
irish
ale
out
of
the
bottle
and
into
a
pint
glass
i
noticed
the
head
is
medium
to
deep
depending
on
the
pour
the
color
is
right
away
the
head
turner
a
beautiful
deep
ruby
unfortunately
it
is
a
very
deceiving
characteristic
the
deep
color
reminds
me
of
fools
gold
while
the
caramel
shines
through
with
woody
hints
the
power
of
flavor
seems
to
be
lacking
it
seems
the
ease
of
drinking
this
red
style
ale
is
its
second
positive
trait
think
guinness
black
but
with
a
lighter
carbonation
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
for
its
ease
of
drinkability
and
deep
color
but
i
feel
the
flavor
and
alcohol
power
is
lacking
an
irish
keg
beer
a
gateway
beer
for
people
that
do
not
drink
dark
ales
or
reds
overall
not
a
flavor
powerhouse
but
rather
easy
drinking
and
a
good
brew
for
the
more
session
level
of
alcohol
overall
its
rather
well
done
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
best
irish
ale
i
have
had
according
to
the

guidelines
this
is
everything
an
irish
red
should
be
ill

thank
you
o
expected
and

not

to
this

more

it
o

irish
red
ale
not
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
will
take
this
over
any
i
have
tried
before
not
a
remarkable
tasting
beer
other
than
the
fact
that
it
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
smooth
and
easy
on
the
palette
overall
a
very
nice
beer
a
staple
at
pubs

often
one
of
the
better
beers
available

red
ale
a
pretty
average
beer
nothing
particularly
unpleasant
just
lacking
in
anything
intriguing
or
noticeably
well
done
smithwicks
is
one
of
my
over
all
favorite
beers
it
has
never
let
me
down
in
taste
color
and
or
appearance
its
a
beer
i
find
my
self
drinking
when
i
just
want
to
relax
and
enjoy
my
night
a
nutty
brown
always
with
a
creamy
head
s
smells
malty
but
nothing
over
bearing
t
the
swithwicks
does
lack
on
the
taste
a
little
but
in
a
good
way
beginning
it
tastes
very
malty
then
just
as
fast
the
malt
goes
away
to
finish
with
a
small
hint
nothing
is
left
on
your
tongue
a
over
all
great
beer
if
youre
out
for
awhile
o
a
nice
alternative
on
st
pats
day
i
dont
have
this
nearly
as
much
as
guinness
but
its
a
good
trade
off
for
a
full
bodied
ale
but
one
thats
a
bit
more
bitter
good
dark
color
with
nice
foamy
head
off
the
pour
that
laced
nicely
malty
and
smooth
nothing
jumps
out
as
great
but
nothing
bad
either
just
a
good
old
reliable
pub
choice
that
i
could
drink
anytime
if
nothing
better
was
available
i
tried
this
to
experience
the
presence
of
diacetyl
and
found
it
near
the
finish
not
offputting
and
appropriate
to
the
style
it
made
me
analyze
an
old
favorite
a
little
harder
i
found
it
to
be
an
easy
drink
but
not
as
flush
with
character
light
body
slightly
prickly
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
o
it
was
ok
overall
just
a
decent
beer
not
too
much
to
say
about
in
a
good
and
bad
way
there
was
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
spectacular
just
another
beer
of
the
thousands
ive
consumed
still
this
could
be
up
someone
elses
alley
so
i
would
recommend
received
as
a
gift
and
i
popped
a
top
the
bottle
appearance
is
unimpressive
who
the
hell
is
smithwick
but
it
does
say
guinness
which
i
find
decent
smell
faint
sweetness
taste
bad
hops
and
metallic
brewing
vessel
long
finish
with
a
bad
aftertaste
mouthfeel
thin
but
decent
carbonation
overall
this
beer
sucks
i
gave
it
a
three
on
appearance
because
it
is
a
bottle
of
beer
overall
not
bad
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
a
solid
irish
ale
12oz
bottle
had
a
friends
house
pours
a
clear
light
copper
color
with
small
sheets
of
lace
on
top
mild
sticky
lace
clings
to
the
glass
aroma
of
light
citrus
sweet
malt
husk
crisp
clean
feel
easy
drinking
with
a
good
amount
of
bubble
play
simple
flavors
with
a
mild
bitter
smack
some
residual
sweetness
balances
it
out
touch
of
fruit
and
alcohol
as
well
not
a
bad
little
irish
beer
id
gladly
drink
this
one
with
a
steaming
bowl
of
irish
stew
o
a
decent
average
beer
certainly
beats
almost
all
other
american
tap
offerings
the
beer
pours
a
dark
dark
red
somewhere
between
ruby
burgundy
and
light
black
with
a
lovely
white
cream
head
that
sits
a
fingers
width
above
my
mug
the
lacing
on
the
mug
is
thin
and
spattered
across
my
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
sterilized
caramelly
malts
with
a
touch
of
staleness
the
nose
is
fairly
simplistic
and
not
the
most
pleasant
but
not
the
most
unpleasant
either
the
smell
is
a
little
cloying
with
sweet
malt
but
subdued
enough
that
it
doesnt
turn
you
off
to
the
beer
the
beer
tastes
very
similar
to
the
smell
with
sweet
sterile
caramel
malts
and
a
faint
touch
of
bitterness
it
begins
with
almost
sickly
sweet
malts
but
quickly
pulls
itself
back
with
a
faint
hint
of
biscuit
and
more
caramel
flavor
which
balances
out
the
taste
into
the
finish
which
is
clean
and
only
faintly
tingling
with
the
sweet
sterile
caramel
of
the
malts
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
thin
to
medium
body
with
velvety
smooth
carbonation
that
reveals
only
a
slight
tingle
on
the
close
of
the
sip
overall
this
is
a
mass
produced
beer
but
it
is
an
irish
mass
produced
beer
and
ireland
just
seems
to
do
mass
production
better
than
everyone
else
sure
it
is
not
as
flavorful
as
some
beers
and
definitely
has
some
almosttoosweet
flavors
to
it
that
are
both
sterile
and
weird
but
this
beer
is
generally
very
drinkable
and
not
offensive
to
the
palate
its
not
a
fancy
beer
but
its
one
that
is
easy
to
find
and
easy
to
drink
and
it
does
have
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
of
a
flavor
than
other
mass
produced
beers
its
a
good
drink
a
decent
enough
beer
a
solid
ale
that
hits
the
spot
everything
about
the
beer
said
it
had
to
be
superb
but
for
me
it
feel
quiet
short
pours
a
clear
amber
red
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
quickly
disappears
and
no
lacing
smell
is
very
mild
theres
a
little
bit
of
caramel
and
a
hint
of
fruit
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
towards
the
end
medium
carbonation
and
a
fairly
light
body
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
just
nothing
spectacular
not
what
i
would
imagine
getting
regularly
but
worth
a
try
o
decent
beer
to
enjoy
a
couple
of
pints
while
watching
american
football
on
a
late
sunday
evening
in
dublin
but
nothing
amazing
o
ive
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
so
i
can
honestly
say
that
what
i
just
drank
from
the
can
in
canada
is
not
what
you
get
there
for
starters
i
served
it
too
cold
but
the
whole
thing
is
different
o
a
great
beer
fantastic
irish
session
beer
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
would
be
the
bud
light
to
guinness
bud
heavy
granted
they
arent
the
same
style
but
you
get
my
point
o
not
the
greatest
but
its
a
classic
offering
o
this
is
usually
my
favorite
goto
brew
around
st
pattys
day
although
im
used
to
having
it
in
draft
this
bottle
tastes
a
bit
different
then
im
used
to
and
although
its
not
unenjoyable
i
def
have
to
say
im
gonna
stick
with
the
drafts
gave
higher
then
normal
scores
because
of
it
overall
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
irish
red
very
drinkable
espcially
on
tap
thanks
this
beer
pours
a
maple
syrup
clear
brown
with
a
2
inch
lingering
foamy
head
leaving
substantial
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
honey
with
some
citrus
notes
as
well
taste
is
sweet
malt
balanced
well
with
hops
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
pretty
good
beer
although
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
dark
cherry
red
with
a
two
and
a
half
finger
head
the
smell
is
of
sweet
candy
lots
of
sweet
candy
unfortunately
the
taste
is
of
agave
and
tequila
i
hate
tequila
thus
and
so
why
it
is
getting
the
current
rating
that
it
is
getting
from
me
the
mouthfeel
opens
up
nothing
else
just
more
agave
and
tequila
sweet
yes
drinkable
perhaps
bad
tasting
depends
on
whether
or
not
you
can
drink
cuervo
the
only
beer
i
have
had
that
tastes
like
it
should
be
made
into
a
liqueur
or
better
yet
a
tequila
id
avoid
but
i
got
the
bottle
for
free
so
no
true
complaints
overall
a
2
basically
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
offering
it
is
drinkable
and
sessionable
certainly
it
is
far
preferable
to
the
light
yellow
corn
and
rice
slop
that
some
people
call
beer
but
thats
the
best
i
can
do
for
a
compliment
o
i
feel
that
me
and
this
beer
will
get
along
during
several
occations
dinner
parties
cookouts
family
gettogethers
chill
time
with
your
homies
etc
this
could
shamelessly
be
somebodys
favorite
beer
it
may
be
becoming
mine
o
relatively
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
think
this
one
might
be
a
little
more
enjoyable
on
nitro
than
it
is
on
tap
this
is
just
on
the
border
of
being
sessionable
might
be
just
a
hint
too
bitter
im
not
going
to
do
the
astmo
for
this
beer
it
is
average
in
almost
every
respect
i
did
like
the
appearance
with
its
dark
amber
and
full
rocky
head
but
there
was
nothing
else
remarkable
about
it
a
biscuity
malty
aroma
leads
to
a
biscuity
almost
malty
flavor
nothing
grand
nothing
offensive
either
a
slight
flavor
of
english
hops
ekg
fuggles
i
would
definitely
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
but
i
would
also
be
happy
to
see
it
among
the
normal
lineup
of
bmc
beers
i
will
add
that
drinking
it
from
a
glass
was
significantly
better
than
from
the
bottle
as
is
usually
the
case
overall
a
beer
i
would
have
been
much
more
impressed
with
enforce
discovering
founders
dfh
etc
not
bad
by
any
means
but
merely
passable
dark
brown
pour
large
bubbles
decent
lacing
not
many
overarching
scents
soy
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
rather
smooth
though
nothing
special
lots
of
malt
in
the
taste
and
a
bit
of
chocolate
rounds
out
this
average
brew
it
ends
with
a
strange
aftertaste
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
i
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
jigger
i
got
a
four
fingered
head
of
creme
colored
head
that
faded
to
some
lacing
the
color
was
of
an
ambertea
color
and
very
clear
the
nose
was
sweet
with
malt
and
a
hint
of
grass
and
lemon
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
was
sweet
with
a
tiny
bit
of
bitter
from
the
hops
and
a
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
being
bready
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
good
solid
beer
but
not
outstanding
in
any
area
i
will
buy
this
again
from
time
to
time
as
its
very
drinkable
the
lightly
carbonated
mouth
feel
matches
well
with
the
finish
some
fruit
smooth
and
refreshing
a
solid
beer
its
a
good
choiceeasy
to
drink
with
good
character
o
not
bad
good
choice
when
only
options
are
other
macros
final
thoughts
methinks
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
the
benchmark
for
this
style
its
far
better
then
kilkenny
and
id
be
interested
to
see
what
nitro
would
do
for
this
one
m
medium
body
slightly
creamy
light
carbonation
smithwicks
has
a
perfect
head
when
poured
correctly
with
dark
red
brown
body
nice
hoppy
ale
taste
with
no
aftertaste
all
in
all
goes
down
smooth
and
a
great
pick
if
you
want
a
little
taste
of
ireland
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
pours
clear
dark
reddish
copper
with
an
abundant
offwhite
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
its
a
faint
smell
it
smells
of
bread
and
it
has
that
nuttygrassy
type
of
aroma
the
flavor
is
fairly
neutral
there
are
flavors
of
caramel
and
its
slightly
nutty
theres
a
slight
back
end
bitterness
the
flavor
is
fairly
average
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
its
moderately
carbonated
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
mostly
average
beer
i
purchased
this
as
a
single
and
would
not
purchase
this
again
as
a
six
pack
overall
always
been
a
fan
of
smithwicks
this
is
a
good
brew
to
go
to
if
there
is
not
many
options

clean

the

made
this

unfortunately
also
makes
this
close

and
feel
a
pretty
hohum
offering
and
not
something
i
would
order
again
unless
of
course
i
found
myself
in
an
undesirable
bar
with
limited

like
the
one
i
consumed
this
one
in
12

from

joes
overall
its
alright
though
ive
had
better
ive
yet
to
have
a

im
comfortable
calling
this

standby

o
wasnt
expecting
much
but
not
bad
like
it
b
new
in
can
in
bc
not
a
bad
beer
in
that
it
has
a
pleasant
malty
note
that
creates
a
beer
that
works
well
in
the
style
this
is
a
mass
produced
beer
that
actually
delivers
nice
finish
and
nose
though
not
overly
complex
will
buy
again
as
long
as
i
can
find
it
in
cans
o
this
one
is
a
really
underrated
session
beer
imo
just
a
classic
rendition
of
an
english
style
pub
ale
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
complex
or
paticulary
outstanding
but
a
decent
enough
drink
o
this
is
mostly
a
good
brew
i
would
have
this
again
perhaps
next
years
at
st
paddys
day
with
bangers
and
mash
overall
fairly
uninteresting
compared
to
other
irish
ales
ive
had
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
it
is
complex
balanced
smooth
and
highly
sessionable
honestly
this
may
be
one
of
the
better
irish
reds
out
there
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
that
style
id
absolutely
drink
and
buy
this
again
smithwicks
pours
a
rusty
amber
with
oneinch
of
frothy
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
a
good
deal
of
lacing
throughout
sweet
malt
aromas
mostly
biscuit
and
bready
notes
dominate
the
nose
with
hints
of
caramel
poking
through
as
well
the
same
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
erupts
on
the
pallet
before
subsiding
into
some
caramel
and
hop
bitterness
that
blend
perfectly
to
make
this
a
very
well
balanced
beer
a
very
crisp
and
clean
finish
is
a
product
of
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
creamy
medium
body
exactly
what
a
irish
red
ale
should
taste
like
o
a
very
sessionable
irish
ale
perfect
for
calming
down
the
demons
in
a
guiness
extra
stout
o
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
this
beer
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
just
drinking
guinness
on
st
patricks
day
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
overall
a
nice
tasting
red
ale
on
the
lighter
side
but
good
for
the
style
o
still
my
favorite
of
generic
irish
brews
harp
guinness
smitwicks
nothing
complex
but
makes
a
great
black
and
tan
ill
probably
always
get
suckered
into
buying
atleast
one
for
st
patricks
day
would
be
a
great
tailgating
beer
in
the
fall
nice
on
a
chilly
march
night
notes
there
was
a
time
when
i
liked
this
beer
that
was
before
i
delved
into
craft
beer
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
poured
from
bottle
has
a
nice
large
soapy
head
with
minimal
lacing
a
nice
deep
dark
amber
in
color
smell
carries
notes
of
caramel
abundantly
carbonated
but
not
too
much
starts
out
with
a
very
very
light
sweetness
that
leads
into
a
moderate
bitterness
but
finishes
with
a
lingering
sweetness
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
overall
lighter
and
drier
than
expected
also
more
bitter
carbonation
seemed
too
high
decent
sessionable
ale
presents
a
single
finger
of
head
with
heavy
lacing
on
top
of
a
standard
amber
with
great
clarity
smells
initially
of
a
fruity
ale
yeast
esters
but
it
is
shortlived
eventually
settles
down
into
a
normal
biscuit
malt
aroma
flavor
is
a
grainy
and
biscuit
malt
base
with
an
creeping
rise
of
diacetyl
butter
in
the
finish
texture
is
light
crisp
and
fresh
i
cannot
find
any
significant
hopping
character
in
either
the
flavor
or
aroma
and
this
is
fresh
from
the
tap
if
only
the
level
of
butter
was
reigned
in
slightly
and
some
kind
of
significant
hopping
accent
were
present
this
one
would
have
been
pretty
great
this
is
a
beer
id
be
to
drink
any
day
in
fact
knocking
back
a
few
pints
of
this
with
my
bros
at
the
bowling
alley
or
the
local
dive
while
shooting
some
darts
sounds
ideal
o
not
a
bad
beer
quite
good
there
are
some
nice
roasty
flavors
a
well
balanced
sweetness
not
worth
seeking
out
but
its
bound
to
be
a
crowd
pleaser
and
you
can
get
it
anywhere

quaffable
but
only
for
the
right
price
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
overall
good
every
day
beer
which
isnt
too
complicated
at
all
but
easy
to
drink
and
even
easier
to
keep
in
your
fridge
salud
overall
i
think
this
was
better
when
i
had
it
in
bottled
form
it
seems
less
dynamic
now
still
very
drinkable
o
this
is
a
solid
ale
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
tried
smithwicks
irish
red
at
the
tilted
kilt
today
good
beer
and
good
service
the
beer
pours
a
deep
clear
amber
with
white
head
that
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
fairly
simple
malt
the
taste
was
a
decent
malt
based
beer
that
had
subtle
hop
to
help
clear
the
pallet
the
mouthfeel
was
a
nice
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
i
surprising
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
just
a
smooth
roasty
beer
overall
an
above
average
highly
sessionable
beer
that
is
a
better
option
than
most
of
the
beers
available
to
me
locally
it
hit
the
spot
and
ill
order
it
again
one
of
the
better
large
scale
imports
pours
deep
amber
in
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
guinness
and
a
bass
malty
and
roasty
and
defiantly
english
in
nature
although
its
not
made
in
england
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
drinkable
for
its
color
and
fairly
priced
finish
is
a
bit
dry
but
it
adds
an
appealing
character
to
this
brew
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
take
on
the
golf
course
a
decent
irish
red
light
tan
frothy
head
disapates
fairly
quickly
dark
brown
yet
clear
color
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
records
every
drink
you
take
good
carbonation
with
a
smooth
malty
carmel
flavor
this
has
been
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
for
years
but
as
my
beer
experiences
continue
to
evolve
i
find
it
seems
a
bit
thinner
than
it
used
to
be
still
a
great
beer
has
more
in
common
with
a
glass
of
pepsi
than
a
pint
of
traditional
irish
ale
looks
great
but
the
flavor
is
too
light
and
shallow
and
the
body
only
accentuates
its
flaws
before
you
can
find
much
flavor
the
bubbles
scrub
your
tongue
clean
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
stretch
but
it
lakes
smooth
body
balancing
hops
and
intriguing
malt
character
that
irish
red
ales
should
strive
for
i
think
its
fair
to
say
this
is
a
dumbed
down
example
of
the
style
o
standard
irish
red
good
with
food
while
standard
for
the
style
id
recommend
plenty
of
others
smithwicks
irish
ale
i
sampled
a
smithwicks
on
tap
during
at
the
minneapolis
airport
it
must
have
been
near
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
as
the
bar
tender
had
to
resort
to
filling
a
pitcher
with
beer
and
foam
let
a
glass
of
beer
settle
to
the
bottom
and
then
pour
my
glass
so
this
pour
may
not
be
a
fair
review
of
smithwicks
but
what
can
i
do
i
paid
top
dollar
for
this
beer
so
i
will
review
it
as
it
came
there
was
a
deep
tan
color
to
the
body
with
light
carbonation
the
head
was
thin
and
off
white
with
a
good
aroma
of
malt
and
some
subtle
spice
the
smithwicks
had
a
great
malt
flavor
tempered
with
a
subtle
bitter
at
the
finish
some
heft
to
the
body
overall
a
good
irish
ale
even
when
i
got
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
it
went
down
easily
and
i
would
have
had
another
if
it
were
not
for
my
one
beer
per
day
rule
o
this
is
a
very
nice
irish
red
ale
it
doesnt
reinvent
the
wheel
but
it
is
solid
and
widely
available
i
think
this
will
remain
a
standard
in
my
refrigerator
pours
a
deep
coppery
red
with
decently
thick
creamcolored
head
low
visible
carbonation
grainy
aroma
with
caramel
and
bread
notes
a
hint
of
floral
hops
but
not
much
going
on
there
the
flavor
hits
pretty
hard
with
the
caramel
malt
with
some
nutty
and
grainy
undertones
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
a
sharp
cold
crispness
hit
the
tongue
overall
a
little
watery
bland
and
boring
but
above
average
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
d
all
in
all
a
great
beer
its
simplicity
is
one
of
its
strengths
but
it
is
by
no
means
flawless
overall
goes
down
easy
a
friendly
beer
still
its
not
as
good
as
others
but
its
something
a
little
different
that
i
can
recommend
o
not
my
choice
but
not
terrible
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
seek
out
this
use
to
be
one
of
my
go
to
beers
i
dont
get
it
very
often
anymore
but
it
sure
is
nice
during
the
hot
summer
days
o
i
dont
know
if
ive
had
a
beer
that
smells
so
much
like
its
ingredient
malts
than
this
one
it
smells
just
like
a
nice
hot
mash
tun
and
its
oh
so
clean
d
very
well
rounded
and
easily
enjoyable
i
dont
mind
having
a
pint
of
smithwicks
every
now
and
then
not
at
all
o
a
perennial
favorite
of
mine
tastes
like
a
more
expensive
micro
brew
yet
is
readily
available
very
good
session
beer
o
its
a
good
beer
standard
run
o
the
mill
type
brew
but
you
cant
go
wrong
with
it
if
you
were
at
an
irish
pub
overall
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
like
the
aroma
is
nonexistent
one
of
the
better
regular
beers
at
your
standard
irish
pub
overall
this
is
a
pretty
standard
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
certainly
drinkable
overall
simple
middle
of
the
road
pedestrian
but
that
is
sometimes
a
good
thing
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
an
absolutely
boring
and
uninspired
beverage
o
one
of
the
better
red
ales
i
have
had
nothing
extremely
complex
but
it
is
still
flavorful
apperance
is
copper
red
with
foamy
head
that
lasts
decently
and
lovingly
laces
the
glass
malty
not
bitter
just
slightly
hoppy
a
nice
clean
and
clear
beer
with
no
aftertaste
one
to
drink
several
at
a
time

the

too
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
has
a
bitter
component
as
well
fairly
thin
and
dry
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
going
on
here
cant
really
say
id
get
this
one
again
but
its
alright
in
a
pinch
cheers
overall
id
never
had
smithwicks
till
tonight
i
have
to
admit
i
expected
a
little
more
i
cant
in
good
conscience
call
it
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
great
beer
either
for
an
amber
ale
its
pretty
middle
of
the
road
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
as
someone
else
here
said
theres
a
place
for
beers
like
this
with
its
low
alcohol
content
4
5abv
and
overall
average
drinkability
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
a
good
crisp
red
the
red
color
is
nice
and
bright
the
mouthfeel
is
terrific
and
gives
it
a
terrific
drinkablility
at
an
irish
pub
that
you
cant
always
get
in
a
guiness
the
head
is
about
one
inch
and
has
a
sweet
foamy
flavor
that
belies
that
rest
of
the
the
flavor
profile
nothing
bad
here
but
nothing
to
rave
about
d
could
use
more
flavor
not
bad
for
a
traditional
style
red
ale
from
the
uk
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
could
have
definitely
had
a
few
more
overall
this
is
a
smoothdrinking
tasty
beer
its
light
sweetness
and
bitterness
balance
each
other
well
and
its
low
alcohol
means
it
is
a
good
session
quaffer
rather
one
dimensional
but
its
not
a
bad
dimension
this
is
my
goto
st
pattys
day
drink
overall
this
is
a
decent
ale
and
given
its
safe
middleoftheroad
approach
which
is
not
a
criticism
there
is
a
place
and
purpose
for
such
ales
its
easy
to
see
why
so
many
choose
this
as
their
drink
of
choice
it
definitely
goes
down
easy
and
could
be
quaffed
in
great
quantities
better
than
expected
more
complex
than
some
of
its
mass
produced
qualities
would
lead
a
drinker
to
expect
o
good
brew
but
not
great
i
enjoyed
trying
it
there
simply
isnt
much
that
stands
out
here
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
for
a
long
time
but
never
got
around
to
it
until
now
thats
unfortunate
for
me
because
this
stuff
is
pretty
decent
nothing
fancy
but
a
perfectly
sessionable
red
ale
i
certainly
could
have
picked
much
worse
for
my
100th
review
overall
a
good
irish
red
very
satisfying
i
think
this
beer
lacks
character
and
thats
why
i
did
not
score
it
better
a
poured
a
massive
three
finger
head
with
patchy
lacing
good
rention
a
dark
amber
colour
with
a
ruby
hue
s
malty
hint
of
hops
a
little
bready
t
a
dry
discuit
a
stale
malt
some
bitter
hops
nothing
to
write
home
about
decent
carbonation
and
medium
body
overall
nothing
spectacular
and
not
worth
seeking
out
o
decent
irish
red
ale
nothing
special
and
a
little
watered
down
nothing
i
would
keep
on
hand
or
grab
again
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
2
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
puffy
small
cap
nice
rings
of
lace
form
all
down
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
caramel
malt
and
maybe
some
fruity
aromas
there
is
also
a
distinct
herbalhoppy
smell
as
well
taste
is
of
caramel
malt
bread
and
a
bitter
herbalhop
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
my
first
of
this
style
o
a
decent
enough
irish
red
ale
and
the
most
popular
one
here
in
ireland
i
often
find
myself
drinking
this
in
most
pubs
in
dublin
due
to
the
fact
that
american
adjunct
beers
are
all
the
rage
here
and
no
other
ales
are
stocked
d
smithwicks
isnt
bad
its
just
not
very
distinctive
or
complex
it
isnt
even
really
all
the
roasty
it
is
though
very
sessionable
and
full
of
biscuity
goodness
it
seems
to
be
relatively
easy
to
get
on
tap
around
here
to
boot
poured
a
3
linen
colored
head
body
in
masstone
looks
like
brown
tea
but
held
up
to
the
light
its
really
an
attractive
clear
auburn
brown
i
got
no
smell
at
all
from
it
not
even
after
warmed
taste
when
cold
was
any
basic
bmc
after
it
warmed
it
had
the
slightest
hint
of
the
weakest
of
dark
beers
to
me
this
is
another
beer
just
built
to
look
a
certain
way
while
having
nothing
offensive
of
any
kind
in
the
flavor
to
make
sure
it
has
mass
appeal
this
beer
is
really
nice
to
have
from
time
to
time
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
red
color
the
beer
is
clean
and
clear
looking
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
good
malt
quality
to
it
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
as
well
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
good
in
my
opinion
its
got
plenty
of
malt
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
to
bitter
the
finish
of
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
like
the
beer
quite
a
bit
worth
trying
for
sure
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
i
was
met
with
a
small
amount
of
foam
coming
through
the
opening
my
gentlest
of
pours
still
created
better
than
two
thick
fingers
of
tawny
head
with
excellent
retention
when
they
describe
this
as
a
red
ale
that
red
is
a
deepcopper
with
nequality
clarity
like
an
autumn
sunset
drool
as
the
massive
head
slowly
fell
it
created
some
beautiful
lacing
nose
was
quite
biscuity
not
terribly
sweet
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
biscuit
malt
taste
was
prevalent
on
the
tongue
finish
was
slightly
dry
and
definitely
refreshing
on
a
breezy
summer
afternoon
poured
this
irish
red
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
ale
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
color
and
produces
a
nice
off
white
head
the
retention
is
average
and
it
leaves
an
average
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
of
the
irish
red
smells
of
toasted
malt
the
taste
of
the
ale
is
slightly
toasted
with
some
caramel
maltiness
there
are
sweet
undertones
and
some
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
a
little
on
the
dry
side
overall
this
is
an
average
irish
red
ale
whatever
the
case
this
adjunct
syrup
ridden
example
can
outcompete
the
fellows
it
keeps
company
with
macro
lagers
but
pales
in
comparison
to
the
finer
ales
of
the
world
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
nice
finger
of
foamy
offwhite
head
grains
and
sweet
malts
in
the
aroma
with
hints
of
herbs
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
thick
sweet
caramel
malts
toasted
bread
a
bit
leafy
with
slight
notes
of
dark
fruits
very
little
to
speak
of
in
the
way
of
hops
smooth
medium
bodied
and
very
drinkable
for
a
mainstream
beer
and
a
preferred
choice
of
mine
for
casual
drinking
definitely
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again

that
can
be
found
most
anywhere
it
is
light

to
be
enjoyed
any

but
dark
and
heavy
enough
to
let
you

youre
drinking
ale
mouthfeel
is

smooth
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
little
coating
sweetness
the
finish
is
all

tasting
with
a
slight
drying
a
solid
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
satisfying
other
then
that
there
isnt
much
personality
to
it
o
not
too
bad
rather
average
i
had
the
most
pleasant
memories
of
drinking
smithwicks
in
pubs
when
i
was
in
ireland
and
quite
enjoying
it
this
was
the
start
of
my
fondness
for
beer
and
now
revisiting
it
over
a
year
later
the
taste
is
not
as
good
as
i
remember
despite
that
my
fondness
shall
remain
d
despite
the
fact
that
i
dont
like
this
as
much
as
i
used
to
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
do
like
a
dark
semisweet
soda
water
nothing
really
to
it
d
slightly
above
mediocre
worth
drinking
but
nothing
terribly
special
its
ok
as
a
change
of
pace
mo
again
nothing
spectacular
happening
a
little
on
the
creamier
side
doesnt
really
bite
at
all
making
it
really
drinkable
obviously
i
enjoyed
this
enough
to
keep
drinking
it
even
though
a
sam
seasonal
was
looking
at
me
all
night
i
stuck
to
the
smithwicks
beautiful
amber
colour
clear
but
dark
enough
to
be
almost
opaque
subtle
aroma
of
malt
and
caramel
followed
by
a
complex
and
well
balanced
taste
and
a
clean
but
satisfying
finish
overall
a
delightful
session
ale
not
a
bad
option
for
a
mass
produced
beer
and
a
good
option
at
bars
without
better
craft
options
o
it
must
be
my
tastes
changing
but
this
was
nowhere
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
easy
to
drink
but
theres
nothing
that
exciting
about
it
d
decently
drinkable
certainly
not
a
drainpour
but
also
not
particularly
memorable
we
did
have
fun
pronouncing
it
properly
smithicks
at
least
thats
how
i
was
reliably
informed
by
resident
irishers
decent
medium
body
and
carbonation
a
bit
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
you
know
this
really
isnt
that
bad
especially
compared
to
other
macro
offerings
at
bars
like
this
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
it
but
id
drink
one
if
there
wasnt
many
craft
options
poured
a
darker
amber
brown
color
with
just
a
bit
of
head
not
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
to
it
just
some
malt
coming
through
taste
was
not
too
bad
sweet
nutty
slightly
bitter
relatively
light
bodied
beer
pretty
decent
overall
not
a
bad
beer
overall
its
not
something
i
would
chase
after
regularly
but
its
a
solid
irish
beer
and
is
very
drinkable
the
low
abv
makes
it
ideal
for
longer
drinking
sessions
worth
a
try
if
nothing
else
pours
a
darker
brown
color
with
a
fairly
thick
offwhite
head
on
it
the
scent
of
malt
is
very
evident
here
has
a
smooth
mellow
taste
to
it
is
very
nicely
blended
so
not
too
much
of
one
item
sticks
out
i
got
a
small
cocoacoffee
hint
from
it
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
a
very
well
made
and
drinkable
irish
beer
to
enjoy
on
st
pattys
day
or
any
other
day
blandly
drinkable
is
the
best
thing
you
can
say
about
this
beer
oh
it
actually
looked
pretty
good
but
that
doesnt
mean
jack
once
youve
tasted
it
i
wont
bother
with
this
again
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
the
flavors
of
the
beer
leave
something
to
be
desired
but
not
a
bad
irish
beer
to
drink
on
st
pattys
day
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
deep
amberred
color
that
is
crystal
clear
there
is
a
huge
chunky
offwhite
head
that
has
reasonably
big
bubbles
and
remains
for
quite
some
time
semisweet
caramel
and
nutty
smells
on
the
beer
super
sweet
and
tangy
malts
on
the
tongue
when
you
first
taste
the
beer
there
is
a
very
subtle
underlying
hops
bitterness
that
creeps
up
on
the
end
of
the
flavors
it
helps
greatly
to
balance
all
the
sweetness
also
there
is
a
roasted
quality
that
reveals
itself
after
the
beer
has
had
some
time
to
warm
in
the
glass
a
bit
there
is
a
crisp
and
slightly
sour
bite
to
the
finish
with
a
subtle
caramel
aftertaste
tasty
beer
doesnt
poor
much
of
a
head
it
is
dark
brown
in
color
somewhat
see
through
but
not
much
it
looks
very
interesting
i
smell
some
malty
sweetness
on
the
nose
maybe
some
apple
cents
as
well
other
fruits
are
possibly
here
also
other
than
that
there
isnt
much
to
speak
of
on
the
nose
pretty
weak
oh
man
kinda
disappointing
on
the
taste
it
tastes
like
an
irish
beer
for
sure
but
not
nearly
as
full
as
say
a
guinness
it
has
a
very
nice
crispness
to
it
but
it
just
doesnt
have
that
umph
that
some
other
irish
beers
have
not
much
hops
in
the
flavor
its
really
all
just
malts
like
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
like
i
said
not
much
umph
drinkability
is
very
high
but
thats
to
be
expected
with
an
irish
beer
overall
its
a
decent
and
somewhat
unique
irish
beer
but
not
as
good
as
some
other
irish
beers
o
shitty
but
not
without
its
charm
md
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
but
leaves
the
mouth
with
a
dry
feel
and
having
a
light
bodied
feel
makes
it
easy
to
drink
d
in
right
setting
yes
but
would
likely
try
something
different
in
round
2
from
the
bottle
pours
amber
with
a
very
foamy
white
head
it
kind
of
smells
like
a
pilsner
very
light
notes
of
caramel
and
malt
hops
are
very
understated
almost
nonexistent
this
ale
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
theres
just
not
much
to
get
excited
about
boring
12
oz

pours
dark
red
with
a
thick
long
lasting
offwhite
head
and
much
lacing
aroma
is
of
caramel
ripe
fruit
and
grassy
hops
lightmedium
crisp
body
flavors
are
some
caramel
malt
and
earthy
hops
short
watery
finish
this
brew
tastes
like
a
macro
on
steroids
it
poured
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
2
and
half
finger
head
that
died
down
pretty
fast
but
hung
around
until
the
end
it
smells
fairly
light
a
little
roasted
malt
and
some
nuttyness
and
a
little
bit
of
grain
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
but
more
pronounced
roastedburnt
malt
taste
and
a
little
bready
that
coats
the
entire
mouth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
not
too
complex
but
not
too
light
on
flavour
which
is
a
good
thing
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
i
dont
like
the
way
it
makes
me
thirsty
afer
drinking
it
d
i
have
this
beer
quite
often
and
i
go
up
and
down
on
it
it
is
much
better
out
of
the
bottle
than
off
tap
imo
a
well
crafted
beer
for
the
most
part
overall
this
is
a
simple
light
session
ale
dpretty
decent
alittle
watered
down
but
the
roasted
malts
that
come
through
make
this
a
decent
beer
brown
bronze
color
with
bone
white
froth
on
top
smells
like
light
malts
tastes
light
with
lots
o
bubbles
slightly
bitter
but
doesnt
taste
like
its
from
hops
not
to
impressed
with
this
one
but
better
than
killians
irish
red
tastes
kind
of
flat
but
theres
plenty
of
carbonation
puzzling
a
sessionable
and
serviceable
red
ale
appropriate
for
an
irish
pub
setting
if
guinness
isnt
what
you
want
this
is
the
closest
beer
i
have
had
that
is
similar
to
guiness
dont
get
me
wrong
guiness
is
in
a
realm
all
its
own
but
smithwicks
taste
is
very
close
i
have
had
this
also
on
tap
and
its
just
as
good
this
beer
is
best
served
ice
cold
but
then
again
what
beer
isnt
very
drinkable
medium
bodied
for
the
most
part
though
it
does
become
watery
at
times
the
carbonation
is
brisk
and
has
a
decent
overall
mouth
feel
drinkability
isnt
a
problem
because
of
the
low
abv
this
is
worth
picking
up
from
time
to
time
this
beer
is
pretty
plain
but
i
could
have
a
good
drinking
session
with
it
some
day
fairly
decent
for
what
it
is
an
easy
going
sessionable
ale
that
would
go
well
with
rich
flavorful
foods
not
fantastic
though
no
reason
to
drink
this
one
unless
one
needs
to
hydrate
and
there
no
water
in
sight
usually
on
tap
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
dark
amberred
with
a
dense
white
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lacing
great
lacing
a
matter
of
fact
toasty
nutty
light
earth
and
light
coffee
aroma
decent
malty
flavor
with
lightly
toasted
grain
light
roast
and
a
lightly
earthy
bitter
finish
starts
with
just
a
very
light
sweetness
and
ends
dry
with
he
roast
and
hops
cleaning
up
medium
bodied
and
creamy
textured
very
sessionable
if
a
bit
industrial
and
processed
this
has
a
nice
color
to
it
for
a
red
ale
there
wasnt
much
head
after
pouring
which
was
very
pleasant
the
aroma
had
a
roasted
smell
to
it
that
reminds
you
of
a
coffee
house
as
well
as
a
caramellike
smell
definitely
a
dry
beer
i
like
to
look
at
it
like
wine
and
think
of
what
to
pair
it
up
with
as
far
as
food
is
concerned
it
think
it
would
taste
fabulous
with
grilled
or
panseared
chicken
it
leaves
a
nutty
flavor
on
the
palate
i
would
appreciate
this
beer
in
a
casual
setting
so
that
i
could
drink
it
slow
and
appreciate
all
its
flavors
this
may
not
be
my
beer
of
choice
but
i
would
absolutely
drink
it
again
this
a
good
all
around
kick
back
beer
dryer
than
the
nose
lets
on
easy
drinking
d
easily
drinkable
as
the
from
the
start
to
finish
the
beer
is
not
exactly
lacking
in
flavor
but
it
is
not
bursting
with
it
either
overall
a
very
agreeable
and
that
solid
beer
that
i
cannot
see
be
unpleasing
even
to
the
those
with
a
less
discerning
palate
this
is
really
just
like
killians
but
a
little
bit
thicker
m
d
good
balance
served
at
a
lesser
than
freezing
temp
which
is
what
most
ontap
beers
seem
to
be
served
at
and
this
temp
worked
fantastically
this
is
a
very
wellbalanced
great
tasting
beer
i
could
drink
this
very
regularly
d
easy
to
drink
but
one
is
usually
enough
to
get
the
picture
and
move
onto
something
else
a
bit
more
expensive
than
id
like
a
macrolike
beer
to
be
d
really
not
much
going
on
here
its
not
bad
but
its
not
good
its
just
an
average
session
beer
d
the
lighter
body
and
low
abv
make
this
an
easy
drinker
coupled
with
the
overall
pleasant
taste
a
great
beer
to
keep
stocked
in
the
fridge
i
always
like
to
try
new
beers
but
smithwicks
is
one
of
the
few
that
ill
buy
on
a
consistent
basis
d
a
solid
offering
that
may
not
be
all
that
complex
but
is
a
solid
and
enjoyable
alternative
to
other
brews
that
are
produced
on
this
scale
dall
in
all
not
bad
but
not
very
good
either
found
this
beer
by
accident
was
looking
for
a
partner
for
a
black
and
tan
our
local
lcbo
doesnt
carry
bass
ale
anymore
so
smithwicks
was
suggested
as
an
alternative
now
my
beer
of
choice
being
of
german
descent
ive
always
enjoyed
german
beers
smithwicks
is
now
1rst
choice
i
didnt
know
this
was
pronounced
smiddiks
until
last
night
d
one
of
the
good
beers
for
this
style
d
its
a
decent
beer
nothing
great
but
it
gets
the
job
done
if
you
enjoy
this
style
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
mountain
of
fluffy
tan
head
and
copious
amounts
of
sticky
lacing
chasing
the
beverage
out
of
the
glass
aromas
of
dry
roasted
malts
on
the
palate
a
slight
sweet
carmel
malt
with
a
bitter
finish
a
smooth
medium
body
brew
with
a
desent
amount
of
carbonation
smithwicks
has
a
thick
beige
whipped
creamlike
head
and
a
very
clear
copper
appearance
with
medium
carbonation
the
aroma
is
a
light
malt
and
the
taste
is
mostly
mellow
breadiness
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
undertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
and
smithwicks
finishes
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
drinkable
irish
ale
and
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try
rjt
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
down
easily
not
the
strongest
or
boldest
but
definitely
a
staple
amongst
the
style
smithwicks
is
the
classic
irish
red
ale
and
is
largely
responsible
for
defining
the
style
where
the
diacetyl
is
acceptable
and
celebrated
in
this
beer
it
still
provides
an
illconcieved
distraction
for
me
overall
a
decent
red
ale
it
is
both
flavorable
and
smooth
would
recommend
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
amberred
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
caramelroasted
malt
nose
with
little
to
no
hop
aroma
its
light
with
a
stiff
dryness
the
taste
is
the
same
it
has
a
very
drinkable
pilsner
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
faint
roasted
feel
its
light
and
easily
quaffable
a
fine
session
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
isnt
the
most
complex
around
but
these
brews
generally
arent
its
an
accessible
beer
that
most
can
enjoy
a
quizzo
beer
i
thought
id
gone
through
all
the
guinness
products
for
review
but
here
i
am
it
pours
a
nice
thick
white
foam
on
top
of
a
red
body
the
smell
i
found
to
be
rather
faint
in
nature
but
from
what
i
could
grasp
i
found
there
to
be
a
slight
nutty
bread
note
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
happens
to
be
pretty
standard
with
this
beer
there
is
the
caramel
malty
sweetness
no
real
hop
character
and
but
the
faintest
of
roasted
notes
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
thin
for
the
caramel
flavor
but
nothing
thatll
take
away
from
this
beer
this
is
a
easily
enjoyable
beer
one
of
the
good
beers
from
guinness
imo
this
is
easy
to
drink
and
if
you
can
get
it
a
bit
fresher
it
can
be
a
good
option
when
little
else
is
at
hand
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
nothing
truly
outstanding
but
nowhere
near
horrible
probably
wouldnt
want
to
make
this
my
dominant
beer
but
if
this
were
all
that
was
available
i
could
make
do
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
its
sort
of
interesting
and
not
too
overpowering
might
be
a
nice
dinner
brew
in
short
smithwicks
definitely
merits
a
try
in
fact
i
may
pick
up
another
bottle
d
i
prefer
this
beer
when
theres
guinness
floating
on
top
but
overall
decent
drinkability
im
preferring
this
revisit
in
the
bottle
over
my
prior
neartasteless
ontap
tastings
sure
its
still
kind
of
simple
and
forgettable
but
a
3
99
sixpack
was
a
deal
this
cheap
jerk
couldnt
pass
up
d
this
is
a
good
beer
rather
mild
in
flavor
but
very
smooth
its
a
nice
beer
for
a
chilly
day
hardly
an
a
but
something
that
is
a
good
staple
to
have
in
the
fridge
the
taste
is
a
very
fresh
fruity
one
apricot
maybe
apple
and
a
nice
balance
at
the
end
with
crisp
hops
great
prickly
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
go
irish
no
complaints
here
oh
danny
boy
pretty
yummy
stuff
nice
crystal
malt
flavour
caramel
of
course
light
hoppy
finish
wouldnt
say
robust
but
not
timid
either
doesnt
taste
macroish
sessionable
especially
with
the
meat
pototoes
crowd
come
back
to
erin
my
boy
smithwicks
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
have
at
any
time
of
day
when
poured
out
of
a
tap
there
was
1
inch
of
head
at
the
top
the
color
was
magestic
dark
brown
with
a
red
tint
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
although
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
of
a
sip
it
is
easily
drinkable
but
only
if
you
drink
one
at
a
time
its
not
very
good
to
drink
with
other
beers
it
does
have
an
almoundy
taste
with
a
kind
of
toffee
flavor
it
is
pretty
exceptional
overall
and
i
highly
recommend
it
i
will
always
have
a
smithwicks
whenever
i
feel
like
having
a
cold
brew
d
average
but
i
would
not
recommend
it
pours
a
deep
brown
black
color
with
ruby
hues
and
a
thick
tan
head
that
sticks
around
awhile
and
some
decent
lacing
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
with
some
hints
of
smoke
tastes
of
coffee
chocolate
vanilla
and
roasted
barley
and
maybe
some
wheat
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
with
a
thick
medium
body
drinkability
is
decent
this
beer
looks
like
a
root
beer
float
in
my
mug
big
three
plus
fingers
whip
cream
like
head
of
light
brown
bubbles
over
a
dark
body
of
beer
the
beer
color
is
dark
brown
rating
a
30
on
the
srm
chart
smells
like
i
want
to
drink
it
before
i
get
a
good
smell
i
can
smell
dark
chocolate
coffee
bean
wheat
some
spices
and
roasted
wheat
flavors
are
coffee
cocoa
raisins
lime
wheat
barley
and
hops
in
a
nicely
balanced
brew
velvet
in
my
mouth
need
a
little
less
zing
i
have
had
this
ale
before
and
like
it
bunches
oh
yes
i
will
drink
this
again
very
flavorful
yet
not
too
heavy
good
buzz
factor
but
sets
well
in
my
tummy
and
no
bad
morning
after
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
pours
a
moderate
darkened
amber
color
with
a
bit
of
an
off
white
head
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
roasted
and
toasted
malt
as
well
as
some
slight
hop
characteristics
the
taste
is
quite
bready
with
some
roast
and
a
bit
of
hops
moderate
feel
with
good
carbonation
drinks
fairly
well
and
is
a
decent
alternative
at
some
bars
but
nothing
id
really
come
back
to
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
it
doesnt
pretend
to
be
anything
that
it
isnt
it
would
be
very
low
down
on
the
list
of
ales
that
i
would
search
out
but
i
would
say
that
about
most
irish
ales
that
i
have
had
time
changes
a
lot
of
things
i
still
have
a
ton
of
respect
for
this
beer
as
one
of
the
gateways
into
craft
and
import
goodness
for
me
but
unless
its
free
again
i
dont
see
myself
ever
ordering
one
outside
of
some
need
to
experience
nostalgia
in
my
olden
days
far
from
now
great
drinkability
a
tasty
irish
red
solid
enough
dont
get
it
that
often
but
always
enjoy
it
when
i
have
it
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
and
smooth
before
you
know
it
the
glass
is
empty
an
above
average
beer
to
enjoy
with
any
occasion
a
downside
to
the
beer
is
that
its
not
as
complex
tasting
as
other
beers
out
there
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
easily
could
have
a
couple
of
these
in
one
sitting
good
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
for
friends
poping
in
d
overall
this
is
decent
yet
uninspiring
ale
its
quaffable
but
mostly
because
of
its
relative
blandness
like
pretty
much
all
guinness
beers
its
a
macro
at
heart
but
is
still
decent
highly
drinkable
d
not
a
beginners
beer
somewhat
thinker
then
the
ordinary
beer
its
made
by
guinness
which
has
a
reputation
for
its
beers
to
be
on
the
thicker
side
drinkability
a
decent
unassuming
ale
while
certainly
not
the
best
out
there
you
could
do
a
whole
lot
worse
every
person
has
their
own
taste
this
is
the
absolute
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
the
color
was
a
darkish
brown
red
with
a
perfect
cream
color
head
the
taste
and
flavor
of
this
beer
far
exceeded
what
i
expected
and
left
me
wanting
more
it
was
a
heavy
beer
to
me
which
is
my
style
but
may
not
be
agreed
upon
my
others
overall
perfection
here
in
my
book
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
but
thats
all
just
opinion
another
quizzo
beer
we
came
in
second
this
week
couldnt
repeat
dammit
it
pours
a
darkish
ambercopper
topped
by
finger
or
so
of
ecru
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
light
caramel
and
light
flowers
the
taste
is
nearly
identical
to
the
smell
though
eversoslightly
caramelier
not
by
much
though
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
brew
ive
been
drinkin
em
for
years
now
nothing
overtly
special
and
nothing
very
emblematic
of
irish
reds
in
general
but
a
tasty
and
drinkableenough
brew
to
enjoy
while
rockin
fools
at
pub
trivia
deep
brownishred
color
with
a
pleasent
offwhite
head
that
reduces
to
a
healthy
cap
sweet
light
toasted
malt
aroma
with
a
hint
of
fruit
light
bodied
with
low
carboation
nice
toasted
malt
taste
with
with
very
light
fruit
flavor
with
a
dry
toasted
malt
finish
easy
to
drink
overall
i
was
disappointed
frankly
a
big
gulp
bolus
to
the
gullett
is
best
ill
have
a
few
more
and
see
m
even
at
the
beginning
it
is
refreshing
the
felling
change
fast
to
a
bitter
intense
not
very
cool
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
havent
had
many
beers
in
this
style
before
but
this
could
make
me
seek
out
more
d
good
choice
went
at
the
pub
or
any
place
really
cheers
d
this
beer
was
first
recommended
to
me
as
like
a
newcastle
only
moreso
the
appellation
is
not
without
merit
especially
when
this
beer
is
drunk
straight
from
the
bottle
which
seems
to
dampen
the
sweet
notes
and
accentuate
the
malts
giving
it
the
character
of
an
english
brown
ale
smithwicks
certainly
shares
the
humble
agreeability
of
its
english
cousin
with
the
added
boon
that
there
is
a
far
greater
consistency
of
flavor
and
character
between
beers
i
dont
know
how
many
other
people
have
shared
my
experience
but
i
believe
the
clear
bottles
are
to
blame
for
the
radical
variation
in
that
other
beer
but
i
digress
smithwicks
is
extremely
drinkable
versatile
consistent
and
tasty
overall
i
was
very
impressed
with
smiths
i
had
this
in
a
tasting
alongside
stella
artois
and
peroni
and
this
beer
was
the
best
it
has
the
perfect
bitterness
and
only
slight
carbonation
is
it
my
favorite
no
does
it
stand
up
very
well
against
other
imports
yes
and
the
best
part
is
that
i
had
low
expectations
i
like
that
smiticks
is
actually
from
ireland
as
appose
to
the
canadian
guinness
of
u
s
a
which
taste
nothing
like
irish
guinness
smiticks
tastes
the
same
in
europe
as
america
this
is
a
nice
solid
ale
well
worth
trying
this
is
a
golden
red
colour
with
a
big
frothy
head
very
smooth
and
creamy
almost
buttery
there
is
some
kind
of
earthy
flavour
present
in
the
background
but
overall
quite
a
sweet
taste
with
a
bit
of
a
metallic
finish
a
pretty
pleasant
overall
combination
a
nice
irish
ale
ill
definitely
order
this
at
a
pub
sometime
soon
or
perhaps
pick
up
another
6pack
drinkablity
is
good
certainly
and
easy
drinking
beer
not
particularly
complex
in
flavor
but
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
session
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
i
love
smittys
for
a
much
cheaper
beer
its
very
good
m
pretty
smooth
not
quite
what
i
would
call
creamy
easy
to
drink
although
not
many
complex
flavors
i
would
be
interested
to
know
what
this
stuff
tasted
like
before
guinness
took
it
over
i
had
this
beer
once
before
this
review
and
i
didnt
have
a
problem
with
it
this
time
around
i
was
not
impressed
if
someone
offered
this
to
me
id
probably
drink
it
but
i
wont
buy
it
on
my
own
the
taste
has
a
slight
bitterness
that
youd
expect
from
roasted
barley
with
little
hops
presence
malty
sweetness
is
paired
with
a
somewhat
unpleasant
metallic
taste
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
off
flavor
puts
me
off
a
bit
the
body
is
fairly
light
and
the
carbonation
is
prickly
drinkability
is
ok
sampled
in

it
pours
more
amber
brown
than
red
with
a
decent
halfinch
frothy
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
nice
maltynutty
sensation
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumthick
with
a
honey
like
texture
the
taste
is
on
the
bitter
side
with
a
fairly
nice
but
lightly
hopped
ending
likeable
overall
d
nice
malt
character
and
good
looking
beer
pretty
good
in
a
style
with
a
lot
of
average
beers
id
love
to
say
that
this
was
a
sensual
satisfying
pint
and
that
i
found
all
the
charm
of
the
irish
local
in
the
socalled
irish
pub
in
which
i
drank
it
unfortunately
neither
could
be
further
from
the
truth
in
both
all
i
found
was
bastardized
commodities
that
market
the
illusion
of
ireland
without
the
thinnest
of
actual
veritableness
or
virtue
drinkabilty
is
average
you
will
get
bored
of
this
beer
faster
than
you
will
get
full
or
buzzed
poured
a
caramel
brown
with
around
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
followed
up
by
a
pleasant
taste
of
brown
sugar
biscuit
and
more
caramel
quick
finish
with
minimal
bitterness
or
hoppy
presence
nice
session
beer
though
it
lost
much
of
its
zip
as
it
warmed
it
has
a
certain
creaminess
to
it
due
to
the
carbonation
nice
combo
of
balanced
malt
flavors
from
lightly
toasty
with
a
hint
roast
to
the
broad
spectrum
of
caramely
flavors
hops
are
minimal
finish
is
clean
pretty
basic
for
the
style
then
again
its
a
pretty
basic
style
d
i
found
nothing
holding
me
back
from
nice
long
drinks

and
a

this
ones
my
favorite
of
all
the
guinnessproduced
brews
drinkability
overall
i
liked
this
beer
it
probably
wont
make
it
into
the
regular
rotation
but
every
once
in
awhile
would
be
great
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
was
a
good
tasted
but
it
feels
like
am
drinking
a
guiness
ultra
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
for
a
few
pints
but
not
much
complexity
here
so
its
a
beer
for
socializing
over
and
not
for
reflective
moments
however
ill
not
be
searching
out
this
beer
again
with
so
many
others
waiting
to
be
tasted
d
nothing
is
overly
offensive
but
there
is
nothing
outstanding
either
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
over
all
not
very
good
this
beer
is
better
than
most
macros
but
i
dont
see
myself
spending
money
on
this
beer
ever
again
the
drink
ability
is
above
average
based
on
its
lightness
but
its
lack
of
flavor
deters
me
from
wanting
to
drink
it
again
d
a
very
drinkable
and
altogether
enjoyable
brew
not
bad
but
not
too
interesting
pretty
average
i
always
get
this
on
tap
when
i
go
to
the
local
irish
pub
it
has
a
typical
dark
irish
red
color
with
a
white
head
it
has
a
breadcarmel
aroma
the
taste
is
a
bitter
start
with
a
smoother
light
breadcarmel
finish
lighter
mouth
feel
and
for
me
extremely
drinkable
it
has
a
simple
taste
that
is
not
overwhelming
and
for
me
is
just
a
nice
simple
brew
12oz

it
helping
it

overall
its

beer
nothing
special
but
drinkable
had
a
pint
on
draught
at
devlins
in
brighton
center
this
past
sat
night
even
though
this
beer
is
on
tap
just
about
everywhere
i
have
not
had
one
in
5
years
so
i
figured
on
one
for
old
time
sake
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
brownish
red
color
barely
visible
head
no
noticeable
smell
taste
was
pretty
average
a
bit
malty
kinda
tart
in
the
finish
very
watery
body
not
sure
how
people
can
drink
these
all
night
overall
very
boring
i
have
not
missed
much
by
skipping
this
beer
for
so
long
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
order
on
a
reguler
basais
when
i
go
out
to
eat
i
would
for
sure
buy
cases
of
this
if
i
saw
it
at
the
beer
store
mouth
sensually
rich
feel
loved
the
color
of
this
beer
nice
dark
red
but
the
smell
was
not
too
impressive
the
taste
is
exceptional
this
is
definiately
my
go
to
irish
beer
or
beer
during
st
patties
i
think
this
beer
goes
great
with
any
traditional
irish
food
like
bangers
and
mash
or
a
nice
shephards
pie
very
tasty
and
since
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
guiness
beer
i
will
be
getting
more
and
more
of
this
one
d
since
this
beer
is
almost
not
noticeable
in
terms
of
abv
flavor
and
fillingness
i
would
say
its
a
drinkability
winner
very
sessionable
heck
of
a
consolation
prize
here
hey
look
this
actually
quite
decent
coming
from
guinnessdiageo
easy
to
throw
back
quite
a
few
with
some
corned
beef
a
hearty
stew
or
roast
game
on
tap
at
virtus
in
waterbury
ct
this
well
known
brew
poured
into
the
pint
glass
a
dark
carmel
color
with
a
giant
slightly
offwhite
head
and
lots
of
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
yeasty
grass
hop
bitterness
and
caramel
malt
not
too
complex
but
decent
enough
the
flavor
is
very
consistent
with
the
aroma
grassy
tartness
with
thin
malt
background
peppery
carbonation
fairly
thin
and
refreshing
pretty
easy
drinking
if
you
like
the
tart
side
of
ales
not
bad
but
nothing
exciting
to
me
d
im
getting
a
rather
bitter
finish
but
i
specifically
remember
it
being
smoother
than
this
the
last
time
i
had
it
its
a
rather
drinkable
beer
maybe
this
experience
warrants
a
revisit
down
the
line
overall
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
makes
a
good
transition
beer
for
somebody
who
wants
to
switch
from
a
typical
bmc
product
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
alternative
to
a
lager
for
a
bbqmowing
my
lawn
type
brew
quite
session
able
i
wouldnt
call
this
sessionable
i
like
to
enjoy
my
session
beers
with
the
almost
complete
lack
of
taste
this
is
past
the
point
of
sessionable
and
nothing
more
than
a
pounder
or
a
pregamer
if
drinkability
were
just
measured
on
how
easy
it
is
to
slam
a
beer
this
would
get
a
5
however
this
earns
a
1
in
the
enjoyment
part
of
drinkability
so
i
dont
feel
too
bad
for
giving
it
a
3
overall
very
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
a
little
low
on
the
attenuation
would
like
just
a
little
less
sweet
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
as
well
as
a
beer
that
can
be
combined
with
guinness
for
a
black
and
tan
drinkability
the
drinkability
depends
on
the
drinker
if
you
are
like
me
and
enjoy
a
beer
that
offers
alot
of
different
feelings
in
one
bottle
and
you
dont
mind
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
enjoy
a
beer
that
has
the
consistency
of
beer
not
water
so
i
really
enjoy
this
particular
brew
all
i
can
say
is
try
it
it
is
on
my
top
favorite
beer
list
and
is
way
better
than
killians
i
put
these
away
in
a
pretty
consistent
fashion
d
its
bitterness
as
compared
to
some
others
makes
it
not
as
drinkable
as
i
prefer
though
it
does
taste
and
feel
above
average
its
a
bit
harsh
for
only
a
4
5
abv
very
drinkable
fullfilling
and
refreshing
i
like
this
beer
it
may
surprise
you
and
it
gives
you
a
lot
for
the
price
overall
mouthfeel
is
about
standard
nothing
special
drinkability
is
great
for
smithwicks
i
could
put
down
this
one
all
day
wonderful
beer
fairly
drinkable
but
seeming
a
bit
too
hopforward
though
not
in
a
good
way
and
seeming
contradictory
to
the
style
overall
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
go
too
very
often
easily
drinkable
low
abv
and
good
balance
no
overpowering
flavors
however
there
isnt
anything
complex
either
a
good
session
beer
d
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
st
patricks
day
libation
d
definitely
will
have
a
few
of
these
today
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
seems
like
it
matches
up
with
the
style
nicely
so
it
might
be
a
bit
unfair
to
compare
it
to
other
styles
of
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
irish
red
enjoy
it
pours
a
copperred
color
nice
big
fluffy
head
to
it
that
sticks
around
with
a
lot
of
lacing
taste
is
pretty
light
bodied
nice
mouthfeel
though
nice
and
malty
some
caramel
taste
in
there
pretty
well
balanced
and
smooth
definitely
very
drinkable
the
lightness
of
the
body
hurts
this
beer
a
lot
imo
but
still
pretty
solid
for
being
a
mass
produced
import
it
was
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
st
pattys
day
weekend
be
irish
and
give
this
beer
a
try
d
great
beer
definitely
going
to
have
a
few
more
for
st
pattis
day
irish
red
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
that
fyi
the
w
in
smithwicks
is
silent
for
those
of
you
who
like
sounding
all
intellectual
and
stuff
d
the
beer
is
smooth
and
what
smithwicks
does
right
it
does
very
well
roasty
flavor
its
a
sweet
tasting
beer
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
my
taste
however
if
youre
looking
for
a
sweet
tasting
beer
with
some
toasty
goodness
this
beer
goes
down
easily
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
without
compromise
nice
amber
color
with
some
head
noticed
and
good
lacing
to
boot
a
malty
smell
in
toe
bitter
in
taste
sweet
if
you
will
gulp
factor
is
on
the
high
level
medium
bodied
makes
for
easy
sipping
and
a
sweet
pleasant
withdraw
of
the
malt
is
the
star
of
this
beer
a
very
drinkable
brew
that
i
will
be
returning
to
when
available
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
wish
it
were
more
hoppy
but
you
have
to
respect
the
style
of
the
land
i
recommend
over
guinness
any
day
of
the
week
cheers
this
is
a
nice
all
around
brew
very
light
in
body
to
the
mouth
but
also
creamy
the
head
never
quits
right
down
to
the
bottom
very
drinkable
and
with
a
low
but
fizzy
carb
yeasty
aroma
and
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
from
its
low
level
of
hoppiness
some
tinny
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
of
newcastle
brown
ale
this
is
much
like
that
but
creamier
and
a
bit
sweeter
recommended
i
could
and
have
drank
these
all
night
long
no
problem
in
fact
my
picture
is
from
halloween
three
years
ago
where
i
was
drinking
pitchers
of
smithwicks
by
myself
the
wait
to
get
a
beer
from
the
bar
was
half
an
hour
long
so
when
we
got
up
there
we
would
just
order
pitchers
for
ourselves
and
drink
straight
out
of
those
needless
to
say
it
was
a
messy
way
to
drink
but
a
fun
one
poured
a
fairly
dark
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
the
light
tan
head
did
not
last
long
at
all
i
got
whiffs
of
caramel
and
sweet
maltiness
malt
flavor
dominates
the
taste
also
but
the
hops
are
there
just
enough
nice
and
smooth
this
was
a
good
nacho
coolant
nothing
special
but
kinda
enjoyable
at
the
same
time
solid
irish
red
the
last
time
i
had
this
i
made
a
blacksmith
with
this
and
a
nitrocan
of
guinnesss
draught
very
good
as
something
from
the
guinnessdiago
family
of
beers
i
wasnt
quite
sure
what
to
expect
i
know
its
likely
to
fall
under
that
macromassproduced
definition
for
some
and
its
worth
a
revisit
every
now
and

you
can
tell
its

by
its

this

is
i
only
had
it
one

on

in
my
opinion
easy
drinkable

a

they
hit
the
spot
perfectly
a

this

an

forgettable

not

has

for

small
balancing

not
a

very

by

poured

red
with

almost

slicker
sweetish

really
really
really
gooood
o
goes
down
very
easy
leaving
a
nice
coating
at
the
start
which
gives
way
eventually
to
a
dry
feel
this
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
not
particularly
exciting
or
pronounced
on
any
element
in
the
scale
this
beer
is
a
good
session
beer
pleasing
but
not
really
anything
to
write
home
about
o
the
nitrotap
makes
this
beer
have
an
incredible
mouthfeel
that
is
both
creamy
and
smooth
initially
the
beer
displays
a
turbulent
and
hazy
storm
with
granular
sandy
liquid
gradually
settling
to
a
pretty
ruby
hued
body
with
a
thick
and
pure
tan
collar
the
aroma
brings
some
sweet
malt
lightly
fruity
grain
notes
similar
flavor
the
nitrotap
really
does
wonders
for
beers
of
this
ilk
smooth
and
creamy
easy
to
drink
no
harsh
flavors
detectable
simple
and
easy
going
nothing
to
wrote
home
about
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
find
when
i
thought
perhaps
there
may
be
no
decent
beer
options
ive
always
been
content
with
this
as
a
perfunctory
default
at
that
sort
of
bar
both
here
and
even
in
eire
herself
but
now
upon
closer
circumspection
a
few
blemishes
become
increasingly
evident
a
certain
plainness
all
around
be
it
malt
hop
or
well
overall
flavour
which
i
suppose
is
this
ones
appeal
at
the
pub
toss
in
the
lower
than
average
abv
and
this
beer
is
sessionability
incarnate
o
good
example
of
the
style
the
nitro
tap
helped
out
the
scores
for
appearance
and
body
but
overall
i
did
enjoy
it
arrived
in
an
official
kilkenny
pint
glass
deep
reddishbrown
with
around
two
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
kilkenny
smells
like
faint
caramel
with
fruity
notes
and
hints
of
floral
hops
as
is
often
the
case
this
example
was
served
too
cold
but
unfortunately
the
aroma
remained
subdued
even
after
things
warmed
up
taste
is
that
of
a
classic
massproduced
irish
red
with
carameltoffee
the
predominant
malt
flavor
along
with
a
little
roasted
barley
and
some
red
grape
fruitiness
body
is
rather
thin
and
the
beer
comes
off
watery
and
on
the
bland
side
but
there
is
a
tealike
tannic
astringency
that
i
like
in
this
style
and
some
earthy
hops
in
what
is
a
decent
bitter
finish
a
bit
of
cardboard
and
metal
make
an
unwelcome
appearance
but
all
in
all
id
drink
this
before
many
other
macrobrewed
uk
offerings
its
designed
with
drinkability
in
mind
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
and
few
overtly
loud
or
bombastic
flavor
elements
to
dissuade
the
average
pubhound
was
extremely
happy
with
this
beer
had
it
while
at
an
irish
pub
in
canada
the
taste
was
very
good
and
the
creamy
head
which
never
dissipated
gave
a
sweet
taste
to
counteract
any
bitterness
my
first
impression
that
it
would
be
extremely
heavy
which
at
the
time
would
be
bad
because
i
was
about
to
enjoy
a
nice
irish
meal
but
the
beer
was
much
lighter
than
expected
if
i
could
find
this
stuff
in
the
us
id
be
getting
some
for
the
holidays
oeasy
drinking
but
not
overly
flavorful
this
beer
has
some
features
that
are
redeeming
but
in
the
end
it
just
doesnt
hold
together
well
the
taste
aside
from
the
metallic
aspect
wasnt
too
bad
but
there
was
not
much
depth
or
body
to
hold
it
together
after
the
creaminess
goes
down
i
would
have
this
over
a
aal
and
its
an
interesting
style
to
try
but
id
like
to
assume
i
can
find
more
interesting
examples
overall
not
a
bad
beer
in
the
style
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
tasty
enough
to
quaff
with
lunch
o
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
is
best
on
tap
great
looking
beer
when
poured
and
settled
but
everything
else
about
it
was
fairly
average
sadly
the
aroma
was
bland
and
unexciting
definitely
not
an
ale
worth
looking
out
for
im
not
sure
if
it
would
be
better
on
draft
and
im
not
sure
if
i
really
want
to
find
out
either
it
was
drinkable
and
the
nitro
can
was
a
plus
all
i
really
have
to
say
is
this
beer
feels
like
a
practical
joke
it
looked
like
it
would
be
a
decent
beer
since
it
was
poured
from
a
nitro
tap
and
i
had
to
wait
5
minutes
for
the
head
to
settle
to
even
taste
the
damn
thing
but
alas
a
flavorless
waste
of
time
instead
of
straight
up
slamming
this
beer
im
just
gonna
say
drink
anything
else
that
is
available
youll
make
the
right
decision
d
definitely
a
big
letdown
for
me
maybe
i
got
a
bad
can
maybe
its
old
i
dont
know
i
recall
having
this
on
tap
a
while
back
and
i
dont
remember
any
terrible
off
flavors
another
one
to
rereview
down
the
road
i
guess
shame
a
nice
way
to
cap
a
train
trip
out
of
the
city
and
as
a
prelude
to
a
nice
sushi
dinner
from
down
the
street
this
stuff
pours
a
lightly
hazy
bronze
topped
by
a
nice
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
sweet
malt
and
even
lighter
powdered
sugar
i
think
some
light
sweet
flowers
may
have
wafted
in
there
from
time
to
time
as
well
but
i
could
have
been
imagining
things
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
flowers
and
all
only
stronger
and
with
an
addition
of
mild
caramel
and
even
milder
grass
th
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
firm
nitrogenation
and
a
subsequently
silkysmooth
feel
overall
this
stuff
wasnt
bad
at
all
i
could
easily
see
myself
downing
pints
of
this
as
a
guinness
replacement
at
irishstyle
pubs
around
here
if
they
carried
it
overall
i
like
to
drink
this
when
im
having
a
few
in
an
irish
pub
dont
think
id
buy
it
to
drink
in
the
house
though
the
low
abv
and
easy
drinkability
makes
this
excellent
for
long
sessions
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
lot
of
specialness
in
the
taste
or
smell
this
beers
best
qualities
are
the
appearance
and
the
mouthfeel
definitely
enjoyable
o
this
is
not
a
beer
that
will
impress
you
through
your
tastebuds
rather
its
the
kind
of
beer
like
draft
guinness
that
only
works
in
the
right
situation
yet
when
it
does
it
inspires
the
ability
to
put
down
multiple
pints
of
this
in
a
single
sitting
accept
it
for
what
it
is
and
you
might
enjoy
it
a
lot
it
gets
high
marks
here
just
because
its
so
easy
to
down
interesting
to
compare
after
a
guinness
much
lighter
all
in
all
overall
i
loved
this
beer
from
the
tap
and
from
the
can
this
might
just
be
my
favorite
session
beer
that
isnt
a
microbrew
definitely
worth
trying
on
tap
cheers
lampertland
o
passable
beer
might
be
a
good
standby
when
guinness
runs
out
final
grade
2
97
a
comfortable
c
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
guinness
itd
be
a
tossup
theyre
of
comparable
quality
but
i
doubt
id
ever
be
in
a
situation
where
nothing
better
is
available
kilkenny
is
just
more
cream
and
less
roast
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
its
not
something
id
want
to
be
a
staple
at
least
it
makes
for
a
decent
st
patricks
day
session
o
good
beer
but
not
something
i
feel
is
worth
having
too
often
overy
refreshingbut
nothing
2
special
about
this
beer
overall
one
of
the
brews
i
like
to
revisit
once
in
a
while
when
im
looking
for
a
mild
brew
a
decent
cream
ale
but
could
use
a
little
work
to
avoid
wateriness
beautiful
appearance
is
noteworthy
serving
type
nitrotap
od
smooth
extremely
uncomplex
simple
and
drinkable
yet
in
no
way
interesting
poured
from
a
nitro
tap
into
a
smithwicks
glass
nice
raining
as
the
beer
settles
leaving
a
thick
foamy
head
smells
sweet
and
creamy
flavor
is
creamy
roasted
barley
mildly
bitter
with
hints
of
black
coffee
unique
and
very
tasty
not
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
one
that
i
would
probably
not
seek
out
again
this
was
worth
trying
once
but
id
much
rather
have
a
tetleys
if
i
wanted
a
lighter
ale
on
nitro
pours
a
dark
copper
with
an
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
along
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
but
the
taste
is
a
little
flat
its
smooth
and
creamy
but
just
not
a
lot
of
character
to
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
smooth
ale
id
go
with
tetleys
or
boddingtons
pub
ale
this
one
pales
in
comparison
overall
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
a
dozen
of
with
no
issues
it
goes
down
way
too
easy
and
it
has
a
fantastic
appearance
in
the
glass
the
taste
is
pretty
subtle
but
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
some
other
irish
beers
o
a
good
irish
red
from
the
nitro
but
id
take
a
guinness
for
what
i
got
for
this
and
be
happier
o
nothing
big
or
complex
about
this
but
a
real
looker
and
icecream
smooth
for
what
thats
worth
and
perfectly
sessionable
o
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
macrobeer
definitely
one
of
the
best
imports
available
in
south
africa
and
worth
the
price
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
it
in
the
nitrocan
although
it
still
came
off
rather
well
i
would
still
prefer
draught
o
its
easy
drinking
but
the
depth
and
volume
of
flavor
is
not
there
o
save
the
missing
and
vegetal
nose
a
winner
for
what
it
is
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
it
delivered
above
expectations
smell
is
blocked
slightly
by
the
heavy
head
but
there
are
hints
of
mild
roasted
malt
taste
is
low
key
barley
wheat
roasted
smokey
flavors
pop
hear
and
there
hints
remind
of
guiness
slightly
coffee
flavoring
the
feel
is
what
does
it
for
this
brew
incredibly
rich
and
creamy
thick
feel
in
the
mouth
little
to
no
carb
from
the
base
of
the
beer
but
my
goodness
every
sip
captures
some
of
the
huge
head
on
top
and
it
is
like
a
nice
iced
coffee
that
has
been
frothed
overall
a
nice
cream
ale
really
lives
up
to
in
on
the
feel
but
could
certainly
use
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
and
smell
department
especially
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
itself
had
it
in
san
antonio
and
fell
in
love
with
it
its
not
the
greatest
beer
ever
but
very
smooth
has
a
guinness
type
feel
drinking
it
it
is
very
hard
to
find
so
when
i
find
it
again
i
will
def
get
it
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
wish
they
had
it
in
cans
or
bottles
around
me
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
in
montreal
sampling
as
many
as
i
could
find
and
stumbled
along
this
irish
red
pours
a
reddish
amber
some
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
faint
but
smells
malty
even
spicy
taste
is
of
malty
sweetness
drinkable
and
mouthfeel
is
creamy
enough
there
was
nothing
really
spectacular
about
this
beer
but
it
was
a
solid
drinkable
brew
yeah
so
have
a
kilkenny
poured
a
lovely
twofinger
frothy
head
that
died
ever
so
slow
on
top
of
a
brownish
body
very
mild
aroma
of
citric
bitter
hops
and
sweet
malts
but
almost
nonexistent
while
it
is
somewhat
smooth
and
creamy
it
can
also
be
said
to
be
almost
watery
very
little
hop
or
sweet
malt
tastes
just
kinda
goes
over
the
tongue
w
a
little
noise
and
finishes
easy
it
was
an
alright
beer
to
sip
on
at
the
pub
while
playing
darts
w
my
buddies
but
nothing
else
to
say
other
than
an
average
beer
at
best
overall
nice
drink
for
pubquiz
how
disappointing
i
drank
a
bit
of
this
years
ago
and
thought
it
was
good
but
not
anymore
o
this
beer
is
light
everywhere
except
in
the
appearance
a
interesting
beer
for
the
fact
that
i
didnt
expect
much
of
this
and
it
delivered
a
little
more
than
i
thought
it
would
overall
impression
i
wasnt
ready
for
this
irish
red
ale
to
be
so
good
it
was
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
almost
felt
like
there
should
have
been
some
futbol
game
in
front
of
me
while
drinking
it
had
good
attributes
allaround
and
since
i
had
everything
else
ontap
this
was
a
fun
one
to
go
m
head
is
creamy
and
smooth
like
nitropoured
stout
should
be
mediumbodied
with
little
carbonation
dr
average
or
below
average
abv
depending
on
your
perspective
extremely
drinkable
and
a
great
price
in
france
you
wont
find
it
out
of
the
bottle
back
home
tastes
a
bit
different
especially
those
damned
esters
but
still
of
course
a
welcome
beer
anytime
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
give
it
a
go
especially
if
shes
off
the
draught
it
wasnt
terrible
but
it
wasnt
good
either
i
wish
id
gone
with
one
of
the
local
brews
also
served
ontap
but
i
felt
like
i
needed
to
try
something
from
across
the
pond
at
a
scottish
pub
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
the
aroma
was
a
subdued
grain
malt
scent
and
just
a
hint
of
yeast
the
flavor
was
the
same
pleasantly
neutral
the
body
was
nice
full
and
smooth
drinkabilty
was
good
the
went
nicely
enough
overall
a
decent
if
unspectacular
beer
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
probably
not
worth
seeking
out
overall
its
not
bad
very
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
most
exciting
looks
like
a
red
guinness
the
color
was
a
very
nice
looking
clear
amber
the
head
was
creamy
thick
and
white
from
the
nitro
the
aroma
had
some
sweet
malts
in
there
not
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
in
the
way
of
smell
the
taste
was
very
smooth
and
had
some
hearty
malts
in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
had
no
carbonation
this
beer
went
down
like
water
to
me
i
could
have
drank
several
of
these
without
any
issue
for
sure
a
very
nice
irish
red
here
enjoyed
it
fully
o
malty
ale
not
that
exciting
but
a
nice
beer
after
work
a
tipical
irish
red
ale
with
low
alocohol
i
like
the
american
styls
better
more
taste
fairly
gentle
drinkable
beer
im
a
sucker
for
just
about
anything
decent
on
nitrotap
o
i
just
dont
enjoy
these
nitro
cans
not
that
the
nitro
can
had
anything
to
do
with
the
lack
of
aroma
and
taste
but
they
just
seem
to
watery
for
me
not
something
id
recommend
the
appearance
is
the
only
good
part
overall
i
guess
i
just
dont
like
this
style
o
it
is
what
it
is
alright
its
st
patricks
day
afterall
great
appearance
mouthfeel
is
what
this
beer
is
all
about
theres
nothing
off
putting
ive
got
a
soft
spot
for
this
one
happy
st
pattys
day
everyone
a
good
standby
around
st
patricks
day
or
whenever
i
find
myself
in
one
of
those
pseudoirish
chain
bars
canada
seems
to
have
in
spades
i
can
certainly
have
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
the
light
abv
and
thin
mouthfeel
make
for
easy
drinking
d
not
bad
kind
of
reminds
me
of
smithwicks
nothing
earth
shattering
here
poured
from
a
440ml
can
the
colour
is
dark
amber
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
the
nose
is
very
sweet
and
malty
i
get
alot
of
sugary
candy
too
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
and
the
mouthfeel
is
flat
and
very
creamy
only
the
slighest
amout
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
not
a
great
beer
but
there
is
enough
here
to
keep
you
interested
and
its
very
easy
to
blow
through
quite
a
few
in
short
order
making
this
a
great
sports
beer
down
at
the
local
pub
which
i
believe
is
what
its
supposed
to
be
from
the
pub
can
that
contains
a
floating
widget
one
of
the
creamiest
heads
on
a
beer
head
lasts
unti
the
bottom
of
the
glass
really
sweet
aroma
of
candy
and
caramel
i
know
beer
is
supposed
to
have
hops
but
i
would
be
surprised
if
this
had
any
creamy
smooth
goes
down
easy
this
is
as
just
as
drinkable
as
water
easy
drinkable
at
least
it
has
more
characters
than
any
nitrotap
beer
that
i
ever
had
d
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
in
the
vain
of
tetleys
and
boddingtons
its
not
terribly
complex
but
does
its
job
well
enough
overall
for
a
macro
thats
readily
available
its
pretty
good
its
easy
to
drink
and
has
enough
complexity
and
taste
that
its
a
go
to
if
only
the
typical
macro
lineup
is
available
its
hard
to
find
ales
here
in
austria
in
general
so
im
glad
this
is
around
and
easy
to
find
a
good
beer
to
have
while
in
ireland
and
different
than
anything
i
have
ever
tried
before
food
match
oysters
or
light
game
hen
with
a
green
salad
rocket
and
mashed
potato
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
as
expected
but
the
beer
was
extremely
drinkable
crisp
very
smooth
and
very
creamy
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
every
day
serving
type
nitrocan
when
poured
from
the
tap
there
was
not
a
ton
of
foam
in
the
glass
but
two
tons
and
after
finishing
off
the
pint
there
was
one
ton
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
color
was
a
light
hazy
cream
brown
when
served
but
after
a
few
minutes
the
color
was
of
a
clear
medium
goledn
brown
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
spice
or
fruit
or
whatever
had
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
was
of
the
sweetbitter
roasted
malts
and
a
nice
balance
of
whatever
the
components
were
in
the
ale
i
really
enjoyed
it
especially
being
in
an
irish
bar
in
sf
the
abv
is
low
at
4
3a
perfect
choice
for
session
drinking
one
of
my
early
favourites
d
give
this
to
me
any
time
and
im
gonna
enjoy
it
with
or
without
food
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
low
alcohol
creamy
sweet
throughout
yet
bittering
enough
to
just
balance
the
flavor
profile
a
great
starter
for
anyone
just
discovering
beer
outside
of
bmc
types
and
just
a
great
session
beer
ive
never
had
an
irish
red
on
nitro
before
so
how
could
i
turn
this
down
this
pours
a
beautiful
cascading
ecru
foam
leaving
a
firm
fat
finger
of
head
this
covered
a
nice
amber
red
body
that
is
how
it
was
supposed
to
look
the
aroma
was
rather
bland
in
nature
there
was
a
bit
of
hop
and
green
apple
the
flavor
consisted
mostly
of
malted
barley
and
green
apple
the
green
apple
almost
made
me
think
i
had
mistakenly
ordered
a
cider
but
this
was
not
true
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
good
either
the
flavor
however
was
muddled
greatly
due
to
the
nitro
tap
im
not
sure
how
good
it
was
supposed
to
be
but
the
kind
i
had
was
extraordinarily
water
this
is
the
worst
mouthfeel
ive
ever
given
a
nitrotap
it
was
drinkable
no
real
problems
taking
it
down
but
its
not
really
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
guinness
but
it
held
its
own
and
was
definitely
an
interesting
experience
the
crack
glug
also
included
some
odd
noises
as
a
result
of
the
widget
priming
itself
i
suppose
man
i
do
love
watching
the
cascade
when
pouring
from
an
n2
canit
resulted
in
a
finger
of
thick
tawny
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deepcoppery
orange
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
lightly
malty
sweetness
which
was
okay
with
me
mouthfeel
was
creamy
which
is
as
it
should
be
with
this
serving
style
the
taste
was
pleasantly
mildly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
nuttiness
on
the
tongue
finish
was
slightly
dry
pleasant
easily
quaffable
this
was
a
nice
simple
beer
somewhat
unobtrusive
but
with
such
low
alcohol
that
i
could
easily
see
having
it
in
my
cooler
for
a
day
out
kilkenny
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
light
aroma
hard
to
get
anything
but
some
mild
malt
flavor
fails
to
impress
mild
nutty
malt
and
lactose
are
there
but
very
light
the
mouthfeel
is
so
slick
and
dare
i
say
too
smooth
since
it
lacked
any
real
body
or
substance
id
stick
to
smithwicks
guinness
or
harp
over
this
one
pours
a
pretty
dark
gold
almost
a
light
red
very
nice
creamy
head
kinda
smells
and
tastes
like
a
guinness
yet
without
the
roasted
notes
but
they
are
a
bit
noticeable
in
this
one
aftertaste
is
just
like
a
guinness
imo
also
tastes
pretty
watery
but
a
good
kind
of
watery
not
like
light
beer
but
it
actually
tastes
like
this
was
brewed
with
good
quality
water
and
it
goes
down
pretty
good
not
something
i
would
drink
too
often
as
it
isnt
really
my
thing
but
its
pretty
good
and
i
could
see
a
few
people
really
take
a
liking
to
it
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
pours
a
deep
amber
colour
with
a
finger
of
thick
white
head
head
doesnt
dissipate
at
all
and
leaves
nice
rings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
sweet
toasted
malt
with
the
slightest
hint
of
floral
hops
flavour
is
balanced
of
sweet
and
bitter
but
it
is
a
bit
lacking
overall
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
a
nice
beer
to
have
sometimes
but
it
is
just
ok
in
the
end
a
drinkable
beer
and
mostly
enjoyable
but
a
fuller
mouthfeel
would
really
help
it
not
my
favourite
but
okay
cheers
dnot
robust
at
all
the
light
flavor
is
disappointing
after
an
appealing
aroma
i
would
not
have
this
again
overall
not
terrible
but
lacks
depth
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
you
teeter
on
the
edge
of
mediocrityboredom
with
this
one
d
this
is
as
i
said
before
made
to
be
an
easy
drinker
better
than
some
other
big
name
irish
reds
an
ok
choice
but
more
taste
in
the
bottle
i
dont
dislike
it
but
it
seems
average
d
a
nice
alternative
to
guinness
for
me
to
have
with
my
rasher
cashel
blue
cheeseburger
and
fries
pours
a
dirty
anber
color
with
a
fist
thick
frothy
head
which
gave
way
togobs
of
lacing
up
and
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
faint
malts
with
a
hint
of
fruit
notes
the
taste
followed
suit
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
caramel
and
english
malts
with
a
slight
musty
wet
hop
bite
and
some
mild
fuitiness
the
mouthfeel
was
mild
carbonation
and
dry
the
drinkability
was
high
a
very
easy
drink
nice
flavor
with
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
and
sweet
you
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
d
dry
and
bitter
this
comes
across
more
like
an
english
bitter
than
an
irish
red
even
so
it
would
be
a
poor
bitter
with
a
weak
malt
profile
that
is
not
up
to
dealing
with
the
strong
hop
character
a
drinkable
beer
and
perhaps
better
than
average
as
irish
beer
goes
but
not
something
to
go
for
if
you
have
access
to
any
real
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
irish
red
and
kilkenny
does
not
really
improve
that
view
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
perhaps
more
typical
of
an
english
mild
but
not
particularly
malty
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
clear
dark
golden
amber
with
a
very
finebubbled
creamywhite
head
aroma
is
malty
slightly
fruity
and
slightly
hoppy
not
all
that
strong
but
still
appealing
flavor
is
malty
and
somewhat
but
not
nastily
bitter
with
a
whisper
of
fruit
texture
is
velvety
smooth
and
slightly
fizzy
so
it
goes
down
the
pipes
nicely
tastes
like
what
boddingtons
goes
for
but
doesnt
quite
accomplish
a
very
smooth
lightly
fruity
lightly
hoppy
english
pale
there
are
no
bad
tasting
flavors
in
here
so
in
that
regard
its
drinkable
and
at
only

abv
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
the

but
if
youre
looking
for
something
tasty
this
isnt
it
as
another
reviewer
put
it
its
good
for
washing
down
the
pub
food
however
slight
the
palate
is
clean
and
smooth
but
also
very
watery
and
not
have
to
be
a
genius
to
understand
that
this
beer
does
not
drink
it
cascading

good

and
sticky

is
almost

i
would
buy
this

again
this
a
good
beer
for
all
occasions
it
is
not
the
fullest
flavored
beer
nor
is
it
overly
distinct
however
it
is
flavorful
smooth
and
refreshing
it
is
one
of
my
standard
beers
not
an
easy
style
to
find
around
mn
so
i
picked
a
bottle
of
this
up
in
a
mixsix
huge
khaki
head
dark
red
color
fairly
clear
toasty
malts
and
some
faint
floral
hops
on
the
nose
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
nice
mellow
slightly
sweet
and
quite
dry
finish
smooth
and
creamy
mouthful
a
very
faint
metallic
mineral
note
toward
the
end
too
if
it
came
out
more
clearly
as
say
herbal
or
medicinal
that
would
be
interesting
but
as
is
it
isnt
pleasing
except
for
that
this
is
pretty
nice
for
the
style
though
it
could
be
much
more
full
bodied
would
be
interested
to
give
this
a
go
on
cask
starts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
which
gives
way
to
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
full
flavored
but
not
heavy
very
drinkable
overall
not
bad
at
all
it
may
be
an
irish
red
but
the
bitter
edge
means
that
this
one
has
a
lot
in
common
with
an
english
bitter
not
as
nice
as
kilkenny
but
still
a
reasonable
drink
by
most
standards
the
feel
is
about
spoton
herbal
and
mineral
notes
showing
up
in
a
semidry
body
as
sweetness
works
to
tone
down
the
hard
water
element
its
crisp
all
the
way
and
fairly
smooth
but
boring

session

sure

a
good
looking

huge

that

a

make
it
an
enjoyable
swallow
a
decent
brew
but
it
had
lost
its
way
like
harp
it
has
suffered
less
but
nonetheless
has
turned
into
a
shadow
of
the
full
bodied
ale
it
once
was
having
said
that
it
still
has
something
to
offer
and
is
a
step
up
from
the
bmc
crowd
overall
an
okay
irish
red
ale
certainly
would
have
it
again
but
if
i
have
other
choices
this
would
probably
be
passed
up
a
very
drinkable
ale
that
satisfies
without
a
lot
of
bellsandwhistles
lightly
malty
without
any
big

several
of
without
getting
buzzed
o
porterhouse
did
a
great
job
staying
true
to
style
with
this
one
this
is
a
textbook
irish
red
and
the
bodymouthfeel
is
truly
great
highly
sessionable
to
boot
i
could
see
it
pairing
very
nicely
with
a
grassy
irish
cheddar
unfortunately
the
american
palate
tends
to
only
appreciate
sweeter
hoppier
americanized
reds
i
can
see
this
gem
slipping
through
the
cracks
in
our
market
the
high
price
tag
doesnt
help
a
pretty
tasty
irish
red
ale
my
goto
has
always
been
smithwicks
sometimes
even
just
to
pronounce
it
properly
but
were
this
as
readily
available
the
contest
wouldnt
even
be
close
well
balanced
and
fairly
complex
better
than
the
majority
of
reds
ive
had
in
the
last
little
while
light
and
slightly
spicy
hopsg
with
juicy
roastytoasty
sweet
malts
and
long
finish
makes
this
a
joy
an
approachable
beer
for
most
but
not
complex
enough
for
the
seasoned
the
flavour
and
mild
complexity
make
a
great
and
affordable
everyday
beer
this
is
an
irish
red
ale
okay
if
you
say
so
seems
to
carry
a
decent
spicy
hop
thing
in
there
id
say
there
is
a
pleasant
malt
base
on
there
as
well
perhaps
i
am
used
to
explosive
flavors
american
brewers
are
delivering
or
perhaps
its
just
that
not
many
people
are
making
irish
red
ales
so
i
dont
know
what
to
compare
it
to
or
what
to
expect
either
way
this
is
a
pretty
nice
ale
good
character
well
rounded
pleasure
to
drink
i
can
dig
it
irish
reds
are
a
style
generally
bereft
of
character
but
this
beers
got
it
in
spades
interesting

and

a
fantastic

beer
if
you
ask
me
this
is
a
fine
beer
for
the
uninitiated
and
could
easily
be
a
transitional
brew
from
the
mass
market
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
otherwise
this
would
be
well
suited
to
a
tailgate
party
or
other
event
where
beer
is
not
the
focus
o
a
decent
beer
not
overly
complex
but
fits
the
style
i
could
imagine
myself
downing
a
few
pints
of
this
with
some
traditional
irish
cuisine
at
a
pub
o
really
enjoyable
and
really
refreshing
this
is
very
much
a
session
beer
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
drinkable
like
the
other
beers
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
single
finger
head
with
decent
lacing
on
a
deep
amber
and
garnet
body
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
malts
and
even
some
dark
fruit
notes
the
flavor
is
also
mostly
malts
but
they
are
strongly
represented
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
to
the
finish
this
is
very
robust
red
even
for
an
irish
red
medium
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
very
complex
irish
red
one
of
the
best
out
there
o
a
slightly
aboveaverage
offering
but
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
complexity
here
easy
to
drink
and
quite
smooth
but
they
have
better
offerings
for
sure
overall
this
beer
certainly
emphasizes
drinkability
with
enough
malty
sweetnessflavor
to
keep
me
interested
given
its
nye
and
ive
got
a
long
way
to
go
opening
up
with
a
modest
but
wellflavored
beer
like
this
made
sense
to
me
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
rather
nice
looking
red
color
with
a
healthy
looking
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
very
light
but
the
retention
is
good
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
earthy
slightly
sweet
and
a
little
nutty
the
flavors
are
creamy
nutty
a
bit
of
caramel
and
some
grains
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
was
really
quite
nice
for
a
good
drinkable
brew
overall
a
pleasant
red
ale
on
par
with
other
irish
craft
reds
definitely
not
to
be
put
in
the
same
brackets
with
the
only
macro
red
brewed
in
ireland
smithwicks
and
its
nitro
sibling

refreshing
o
a
very
well
crafted
red
ale
something
that
the
style
most
certainly
needs
in
terms
of
refinement
and
freshness
highly
recommended
o
not
a
huge
red
ale
fan
but
a
wonderful
unique
taste
nice
for
a
cool
day
pours
rich
deep
red
color
with
the
thick
amount
in
carbonation
initial
aroma
is
thick
hoppy
and
roasted
caramel
with
a
trailing
aroma
of
cocoa
rich
hoppy
taste
with
an
initial
taste
in
of
hopps
with
only
slight
bitterness
and
finishes
smoothly
and
bitterness
mellows
out
rather
quikcly
taste
is
light
plumy
fruitiness
up
front
some
faint
caramelly
grain
and
a
tealeaf
bitterness
with
hint
of
peppery
bit
that
takes
over
lightly
at
the
finish
and
lingers
it
has
nice
balance
a
little
nice
complexity
and
is
very
good
this
is
just
a
slightly
above
average
brew
with
a
decent
chocolate
flavor
the
cap
is
probably
the
most
interesting
part
of
this
brew
overall
a
bland
unoffensive
beer
from
porterhouse
this
is
tough
style
to
accomplish
since
it
is
so
easy
to
make
a
boring
beer
i
dont
understand
why
they
put
this
on
nitro
it
killed
the
little
complexity
this
beer
had
maybe
a
cask
would
be
a
better
vessel
for
this
brew
d
i
would
appreciate
this
far
more
if
it
had
much
less
carbonation
in
it
nice
to
try
but
once
is
enough
thank
you
but
is
this
supposed
to
be
on
nitro
the
taste
was
quite
bitter
but
still
malty
it
was
refreshing
would
make
a
perfect

chug

may

fantastic
beer
d
it
had
a
watery
malty
finish
overall
a
definite
must
try
from
the
porterhouse
selection
and
as
an
irish
red
would
have
again
although
not
my
first
choice
in
irish
reds
d
overall
drinkability
was
not
bad
but
certainly
not
what
i
envisioned
or
come
to
expect
from
a
irish
red
felt
really
strange
and
ends
up
drinking
better
if
you
dont
think
about
it
the
second
time
around
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
light
bodied
and
smooth
it
isnt
worth
the
plus
five
dollar

tag
that
i
payed
for
it
i
would
much
rather
drink
a
great
lakes
conways
irish
the
flavors
here
are
subtle
which
can
be
nice
at
times
but
they
just
dont
present
themselves
enough
pours
a
deep
dark
golden
almost
reddish
in
color
with
a
good
sized
fuzzy
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
form
a
cap
and
lots
of
sticky
lace
smells
great
dark
crystal
malt
sweetness
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
burnt
sugar
very
little
to
any
hop
present
in
the
aroma
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
light
caramel
slightly
bready
with
some
dark
fruit
and
an
earthy
hop
bite
that
surfaces
just
long
enough
to
keep
it
on
the
right
side
of
cloying
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
light
body
very
simple
but
quite
tasty
brew
very
easy
to
drink
sessionable
ale
if
not
for
the
price
tag
i
could
easily
see
more
of
these
in
my
future
it
pours
a
handsome
clear
dark
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
too
persistent
head
aroma
is
fairly
strong
and
malty
with
a
fruity
undertone
flavor
is
fruity
and
malty
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
texture
is
somewhat
fizzy
and
a

it
is
still

there
a

tones
in

really
subtle

profile
kind
of

flavor
is
really

not

kind
of

a
pretty
big
disappointment
to
me
based
on
what
i
paid
for
it
it
looked
like
craft
imported

but
ended
up
mediocre
import

mellow

dry
drinkability
is
unimpressive
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
shoud
be
paying
top
dollar
for
due
to

d
the
beer
goes
down
very
smoothly
i
could
easily
drink
this
beer
all
night
long
hops
galena

east
kent
goldings
overall
a
tasty
and
rather
complex
red
ale
toasted
malts
dominate
the
flavor
profile
of
this
beer
not
so
much
as
to
be
overly
sweet
by
any
means
i
could
taste
biscuits
crackers
and
white
bread
crust
the
hops
added
a
little
grass
and
earth
to
keep
some
of
the
sweeteness
in
check
the
mouthfeel
has
some
a
nice
dryness
to
it
that
adds
to
this
beers
awesome
sessionability
da
good
pairing
or
session
beer
not
a
standalone
star
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
enough
flavor
and
substance
to
make
it
worth
pounding
for
a
long
time
pours
a
big
frothy
deep
caramel
brown
solid
head
retention
smell
was
a
big
bitter
skunky
almost
pale
lagery
after
pulling
the
cap
taste
was
nothing
like
the
smell
almost
watery
and
light
but
definate
roasted
malts
this
is
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
special
d
at
least
its
4
4
but
come
on
if
im
at
the
porterhouse
ill
have
the
brain
blasta
for
near
the
same
price
pours
a
clear
amber
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
hinr
of
sulfur
and
slight
hop
fits
the
style
of
an
irish
red
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
slight
hop
hint
of
sweet
malt
sulfur
and
hint
of
grain
overall
the
sulfur
hurts
but
other
than
that
a
generally
weak
irish
appearance
is
pale
reddish
amber
with
thin
white
head
nose
is
fairly
faint
despite
the
appropriate
serving
temperature
some
pale
caramel
comes
out
palate
is
round
and
pleasantly
wide
with
solid
carbonation
there
is
that
classic
roasted
malt
that
irish
reds
are
known
for
balance
is
found
in
this
beer
and
its
subtle
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
these
if
only
i
liked
the
style
oh
well
cant
like
them
all
right
still
find
it
to
be
a
well
made
beer
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
but
not
exactly
like
most
red
ales
not
that
that
is
a
bad
thing
there
is
plenty
of
grassy
hay
like
hops
a
bit
of
yeast
and
honey
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
malt
of
front
and
hop
bitterness
at
the
back
end
the
palate
is
thin
for
the
style
but
smooth
from
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
but
thats
about
it
drinkability
this
was
just
an
avg
red
ale
nothing
remarkable
about
it
the
aftertast
last
for
a
long
while
and
i
could
taste
it
a
few
minuttes
after
i
was
done
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
exceptional
ok
im
done
with
these
guys
for
a
while
thats
for
sure
if
yesterdays
oyster
stout
is
their
best
beer
ouch
to
that
i
say
this
pours
a
beautiful
red
amber
lots
of
carbonation
and
another
creamy
head
no
lacing
on
this
at
all
though
smell
and
some
hoppiness
id
call
this
a
very
decent
irish
red
as
it
stands
a
wonderfully
malty
beer
with
a
nice
tart
tang
and
very
slightly
fruity
finish
goes
down
great
but
a
bit
timid
in
flavour
o
not
terribly
interesting
a
little
to
sweet
but
that
could
make
it
a
great
gateway
beer
for
people
who
arent
into
craft
brews
o
tasty
easy
to
drink
red
in
a
pint
can
with
around
5
abv
liked
this
one
solid
red
ale
good
balance
and
descent
flavor
easy
to
drink
also
drinkability
i
do
not
have
much
experience
with
irish
red
ales
so
i
cannot
comment
on
how
the
beer
fits
the
style
overall
though
it
is
too
sweet
for
my
taste
it
is
far
from
my
favorite
great
river
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
would
go
well
with
roasted
corn
salsa
spaghetti
with
a
tomato
sauce
might
even
be
very
good
to
put
into
a
tomato
sauce
overall
another
solid
beer
from
great
river
riminds
me
of
fat
tire
but
i
prefer
the
roller
dam
red
its
worth
you
time
convience
of
a
can
and
priced
great
at
7
99
a
4pk
of
tall
boys
o
this
is
a
pretty
fun
beer
the
malt
flavor
is
unique
to
me
and
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
ill
be
buying
this
again
for
sure
o
while
im
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
it
is
pretty
good
its
relatively
low
abv
makes
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
solid
session
brew
ill
be
returning
to
this
one
from
time
to
time
not
what
i
want
in
a
red
ale
but
definately
well
crafted
i
will
go
back
to
their
pale
ale
for
sure
i
see
this
is
classified
as
an
irish
red
instead
of
an
american
red
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
that
since
it
is
brewed
with
sterling
hops
and
american
yeast
overall
i
bought
a
4
pack
of
16
oz
cans
for
6
29
a
bit
pricey
imo
but
i
wanted
to
give
this
a
try
as
i
liked
the
name
and
like
to
find
good
craft
beer
in
a
can
an
enjoyable
beer
and
well
worth
trying
o
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
ale
that
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
i
actually
rather
like
this
onetheres
not
much
special
to
it
but
its
an
easy
drinking
irish
red
with
just
enough
malt
character
to
make
it
special
i
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
for
sure

with
a
shortlived

that
dissipates

the

bitterness

medium

lower
than
expected

not
great
but
drinkable
i
did
enjoy
their
ipa
a
bit
more
o
ok
beer
fairly
easy
to
drink
it
well
balanced
for
a
amber
and
again
mouth
feel
is
a
little
bit
of
an
issue
i
would
really
enjoy
this
one
being
much
creamier
and
just
sliding
over
the
tongue
overall
i
am
very
impressed
and
this
could
be
a
regular
session
ale
and
one
to
introduce
new
people
to
craft
beer
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
beer
with
some
substance
making
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
o
a
nice
english
style
amber
nothing
crazy
here
but
flavorful
and
subtle
thanks
again
to
cpolking
for
sending
this
beer
this
beer
rushed
out
of
its
can
and
produced
an
amber
color
with
a
1
5
inch
head
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
taste
is
also
malty
a
touch
of
hops
slightly
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
do
thirst
quenching
to
say
the
least
i
want
more
hops
in
my
red
to
say
even
more
i
guess
thatd
no
longer
be
and
irish
red
but
still
my
preference
this
would
be
a
good
local
goto
sessionable
beer
for
me
as
im
enjoying
it
thoroughly
o
this
beer
as
real
drinkable
and
is
a
solid
red
ale
this
pours
dark
amber
and
has
underwhelming
headlacingretention
there
is
a
nice
dark
toasty
malt
flavor
that
finishes
off
pleasant
and
bready
i
can
even
taste
a
sweet
grainalmost
corn
flavor
there
is
no
sourness
that
is
sometimes
seen
in
red
ale
i
enjoyed
this
representation
of
the
style
the
drinkability
is
great
and
probably
the
highlight
o
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
a
really
nice
beer
this
beer
begs
to
be
paired
and
im
thinking
that
irish
stew
would
be
a
good
choice
no
strong
flavors
to
compete
between
the
two
will
need
to
test
that
theory
the
next
time
the
weather
is
cold
enough
kudos
to
the
folks
at
great
river
for
another
tasty
brew
light
amber
pours
with
a
huge
head
of
white
that
came
up
a
full
three
fingers
in
height
smooth
settling
left
a
good
bit
of
side
glass
lace
and
a
nice
and
even
coating
across
the
top
of
the
glass
interesting
aroma
as
it
started
out
with
a
nice
and
well
rounded
bready
malt
that
seemed
to
slowly
evolve
into
a
grassy
herbal
hop
profile
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
from
the
caramel
did
not
seem
to
have
a
clear
direction
but
the
taste
made
up
for
it
nicely
very
smooth
nice
caramel
and
malty
tones
that
won
me
over
with
ease
smooth
even
flavor
crisp
clean
and
well
balanced
smooth
notes
of
grassy
bittering
hops
coming
in
at
the
finish
gave
it
a
nice
little
drying
effect
and
warmed
it
up
very
drinkable
as
it
went
down
smooth
and
left
me
looking
for
more
right
away
m
not
too
much
to
say
here
good
carbonation
pretty
average
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
poured
from
16
oz
can
into
that
ol
trusty
shaker
glass
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
very
small
whiteish
head
that
quickly
disapated
aromas
of
malt
caramel
and
something
i
cant
quite
put
a
finger
on
taste
was
sweet
malt
and
caramel
with
no
hop
bitterness
quite
quaffable
i
could
do
this
one
as
a
session
beer
and
would
definitely
have
this
again
on
draft
verdict
good
enough
but
not
great
try
it
if
its
cheap
this
style
is
usually
one
of
my
least
favorites
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
from
the
few
beers
ive
had
from
great
river
brewery
i
have
had
a
good
experience
with
every
one
of
them
and
am
looking
forward
to
their
other
offerings
nice
medium
bodied
brew
somewhat
complex
with
a
hint
of
a
powdery
dryness
a
surprisingly
warm
finish
for
a
brew
with
a
lower
abv
would
i
buy
more
of
it

received
a
can
of
this
one
last
night
from
my
friend
schmittymack
thanks
dan
had
this
one
late
saturday
afternoon
before
dinner
poured
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
aromas
of
caramel
malt
and
woody
hops
nicely
balanced
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
sweet
malt
woody
hops
and
carameltoffee
d
really
quite
drinkable
but
simply
nothing
fantastic

overall
a
well

red

is
damn
fine
beer
if
you
like
red
ales
that
have
perfect
malthop
balance
the
recent
change
in
iowa
law
allowing
higher

beer
to
be
brewed
was
great
but
rdra
wouldve
been
possible
back
in

days
of

good
job
great
river
and
keep

coming
notes
a
nice
although
fairly
typical
amberred
ale
plenty
of
toffee
and
nutty
flavors
with
some
caramel
sweet
maltiness
but
nothing
too
overboard
another
good
not
great
offering
for
the
brewery
great
options
for
getting
a
canned
beer
and
for
introducing
people
to
craft
beer
worth
picking
up
and
trying
love
the
crack
glug
beer
as
an
auditory
pleasure
in
addition
to
everything
else
my
pour
netted
just
over
a

of

that
burbled
bubbled
exploded
with

and
phased
itself
out
of

phew
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sweet
beers
but
anything
in
the
interest
of
the
quest
finish
was
bittersweet
with
a
light
metallic
tang
bottom
line
for
me
was
that
it
was
simply
too
sweet
for
this
selfavowed
hophead
to
want
to
drink
on
a
routine
basis

fairly
big

flavors
and
light

making
for
an
easier
session
well
made
and
full

still
it
could
use
a

more

to
make
it

not

from

it
is
a
nice
change

for

it
is
good
for
a
deviation
from

niche
plenty
of

a

not

a
good
red
gave
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
and
i
can
say
that
i
feel
it
was
a
somewhat
disappointing
choice
the
brew
was
poured
to
a
amber
color
with
a
good
sized
head
that
broke
down
quite
quickly
leaving
a
little
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
seems
to
be
really
just
malts
that
i
think
gave
off
a
nut
and
caramel
like
scent
but
that
could
also
be
coming
through
in
the
flavor
as
that
is
really
what
i
am
picking
up
after
taking
a
sip
not
a
bad
brew
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
probably
a
few
years
ago
i
would
have
thought
that
this
was
a
good
brew
now
it
seems
just
average
at
best
d
not
very
flavorful
but
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
filling
its
a
good
beer
to
pound
if
macros
are
your
only
other
choices
drinkability
a
dull
and
boring
session
beer
better
on
tap
than
in
bottle
but
still
not
one
i
long
for
drinkability
my
first
and
last
i
picked
this
up
beause
i
heard
a
rumour
it
was
not
going
to
be
made
much
longer
personally
i
dont
think

poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
ending
in
a
nice
hazy
red
finish
12
inch
head
that
faded
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
along
the
glass
little
nose
on
this
one
but
what
is
there
is
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
the
taste
is
suprisingly
better
than
expected
slight
amount
of
sweetness
but
not
overpowering
this
being
my
first
experience
with
an
irish
red
ale
i
cant
really
compare
this
to
any
others
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
a
very
easy
beer
to
session
very
creamy
and
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
although
this
beer
is
anything
but
impressive
it
isnt
offensive
either
good
session
beer
but
nothing
for
a
special
occasion
cheers
i
am
not
sure
what
to
say
about
this
beer
it
was
a
sharp
tasting
beer
with
full
flavors
but
it
taste
a
lot
like
a
lot
of
other
beers
i
have
tried
i
see
this
beer
has
gotten
pretty
good
scores
but
i
honestly
didnt
find
anything
special
about
it
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
bottle
pours
a
pale
ruby
orange
with
decent
clarity
and
streams
of
fast
rising
bubbles
an
effervesent
three
finger
head
of
dense
cream
shows
excellent
retention
and
lots
of
sticky
lace
patches
clean
nose
some
mild
toasted
malt
and
english
hop
aromas
sweet
toasted
malt
and
english
winter
barley
flavors
upfront
followed
by
tons
of
dextrin
and
a
mellow
clash
of
herbal
hops
semidrying
aftertaste
light
sweetness
and
very
balanced
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
with
mediumcarbonation
an
exceedingly
smooth
mouthfeel
finishes
easy
with
a
touch
of
residual
caramel
and
mild
english
hops
to
match
a
session
ale
for
sure
whodey
this
was
a
favorite
of
mine
way
back
when
i
first
started
drinking
imports
and
craft
beers
and
it
disappeared
in
my
local
market
for
several
years
it
has
resurfaced
at
the
world
market
and
im
glad
it
did
a
deep
red
with
a
very
creamy
head
that
lasted
till
the
last
drop
with
excellent
lacing
s
sweet
malts
dominate
with
mild
hints
of
almost
oak
wood
t
smoothe
delicious
maltiness
that
is
a
little
milder
than
the
appearance
and
nose
would
suggest
m
thick
enough
to
represent
the
beer
without
hurting
drinkability
which
is
strong
even
though
heineken
took
over
murphys
i
still
enjoy
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
copper
color
with
massive
slightly
offwhite

smell
is
minimal
with
a
slight
metallic
note

with

with

off

a
sixteen
ounce
can
smells
inoffensive

not

probably
tastier

anyway
worth
a
try
cheers
i
will
buy
this
beer
from
time
to
time
when
im
looking
for
a
simple
beer
theres
certainly
nothing
complicated
about
it
i
admit
its
quite
disappointing
given
the
quality
of
murphys
stout
the
aroma
is
rather
weak
with
traces
of
malt
the
beer
does
look
red
but
tastes
very
little
like
other
reds
ive
had
the
flavor
is
a
little
malty
not
very
hoppy
and
with
a
faintly
tart
aftertaste
that
resembles
many
dutch
beers
all
in
all
a
mediocre
beer
only
good
for
washing
down
food
or
quenching
a
thirst
pours
a
dark
redish
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
smell
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordianary
a
bit
of
hops
a
bit
of
malt
the
taste
is
sharp
and
strong
with
some
bitter
notes
tastes
like
a
hyped
up
macro
but
not
by
much
i
love
murphys
stout
so
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
me
it
has
average
carbonation
a
light
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
good
balance
of
flavors
i
could
drink
these
a
lot
but
not
for
the
price
if
i
had
to
choose
i
would
pick
a
cheaper
irish
red
and
not
find
a
huge
difference
worth
a
try
if
you
are
into
the
style
d
quite
drinkable
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
uninteresting
not
hard
to
drink
just
bland
and
uninteresting
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
light
reddark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
leaves
a
good
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
taste
is
slightly
bitter
but
refreshing
a
good
session
beer
goes
down
smooth
much
prefer
this
to
killians
good
session
beer
cant
wait
to
have
some
more
of
this
beer
in
the
future
poured
the
required
amber
with
no
real
head
retention
or
lacing
a
bit
of
floral
hops
on
the
nose
slightly
caramel
hoppy
but
it
came
off
as
being
way
too
biscuity
and
harsh
not
very
drinkable
and
surprisingly
bad
from
the
same
folks
that
make
the
stout
taste
is
fruity
dry
with
distinct
caramellic
notes
some
maltbitterness
and
actually
pretty
clean
a
good
beer
of
which
i
could
have
a
couple
not
overly
complex
or
bigbodied
just
a
good
pubbeer
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
its
easy
to
drink
but
for
the
price
i
can
get
much
better
session
beers
the
aluminum
can
flavor
is
bothersome
overall
so
id
be
interested
in
trying
it
on
tap
or
in
bottle
even
had
i
not
known
i
would
say
that
this
beer
definitely
tastes
like
heineken
not
many
beers
do
and
this
while
different
certainly
does
it
might
have
been
the
serving
and
it
being
too
cold
but
i
still
believe
the
draught
version
is
better
in
this
beer
the
body
is
limp
kind
of
watery
and
weak
it
reminds
me
of
iced
tea
not
much
punch
in
the
alcohol
dept
so
i
find
it
hard
to
recommend
this
strange
red
beer
i
have
never
been
so
unpleasantly
suprised
by
a
beer
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
nice
enough
complexities
to
let
me
enjoy
one
but
also
a
beer
i
think
i
could
have
for
the
whole
night
poured
out
the
color
of
dark
iced
tea
with
a
thin
white
head
decent
sheetlike
lacing
smell
was
of
toasted
malts
and
not
much
more
pretty
onedimensional
tasted
very
sweet
and
grainy
decent
enough
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
really
though
just
like
the
smell
there
wasnt
much
in
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
was
ok
a
bit
watery
for
my
taste
overall
this
was
fairly
average
neither
bad
nor
good
this
beer
poured
with
a
thick
frothy
heah
there
is
a
thin
layer
left
the
color
is
similar
to
sweet
tea
with
a
reddish
tint
the
smell
is
a
bit
bitter
the
taste
is
not
a
strong
point
on
this
beer
there
is
a
bit
of
harshness
that
is
hard
to
overcome
this
lingers
into
the
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
would
be
higher
if
not
for
the
sharpness
smooth
it
out
a
little
and
get
rid
of
the
bite
and
this
beer
would
be
much
better
average
for
a
red
beer
but
there
is
much
better
out
there
in
this
style
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
watery
but
carbonated
quite
well
not
my
favorite
style
but
ill
take
the
exception
from
this
good
brew
other
than
being
a
safe
beer
with
little
standout
characteristics
there
are
very
little
to
frown
at
a
solid
caramel
malt
flavor
that
hinges
slightly
on
maple
syrup
flavors
and
toffee
lightly
bready
but
mostly
toasty
and
nutty
low
butterpopcorn
flavors
these
characters
come
out
in
the
aromas
and
subdue
into
the
flavors
and
expecially
the
finish
lightly
malty
finish
keeps
from
becoming
as
clean
as
desired
but
still
a
fine
beer
da
good
red
ale
could
definitely
enjoy
this
in
a
long
drinking
session
easily
enjoy
45
more
for
irish
red
it
is
an
average
beer
but
still
perfect
for
social
drinking
this
is
drinkable
but
certainly
not
well
crafted
nectar
of
the
kind
that
most
of
us
seek
most
of
the
time
instead
this
beer
is
good
for
tailgating
or
social
events
where
the
crispness
is
more
important
than
the
taste
which
isnt
this
beers
strong
point
not
for
me
man
this
brew
pours
a
clear
blood
red
color
with
big
bubbles
of
visible
carbonation
the
head
is
large
creamy
white
and
long
lasting
the
aroma
is
mildly
sweet
with
some
butter
and
cream
notes
the
taste
semi
sweet
but
kind
of
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
too
much
carbonation
so
much
that
it
masks
the
flavor
overall
this
brew
is
okay
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
purchasing
it
again
a
completely
ordinary
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
not
real
thin
but
less
than
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
good
also
a
nice
predinner
beer
light
mouth
with
decent
carbonation
drinkable
once
i
got
past
the
nose
but
way
too
boring
for
another
this
beer
came
a
light
copper
around
the
edges
that
faded
to
a
dark
burgundy
in
the
middle
of
the
pint
glass
the
head
was
smooth
and
off
white
smelled
of
dry
ash
and
sour
red
grapes
tasted
of
sweet
roasted
caramel
malts
with
a
dry
and
crisp
hop
balance
that
reminded
me
of
a
lager
very
simple
yet
assertive
flavor
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
light
small
bubble
carbonation
flavor
is
odd
in
general
red
ales
are
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
but
this
one
just
tastes
off
sour
stale
oily
hops
malts
that
dont
really
taste
enjoyable
just
not
enjoyable
i
poured
most
of
this
out
so
i
could
have
something
good
a
little
rough
but
drinkable
with
a
somewhat
lingering
metallic
bite
in
the
aftertaste
pours
a
pretty
clear
amber
color
almost
looks
like
it
has
been
darkened
with
coloring
of
some
sort
the
head
is
watery
and
thin
the
aroma
is
of
a
weak
sweettoasty
malt
taste
is
not
very
complex
with
a
simple
malty
flavor
and
a
tinge
of
commercialgrade
hops
very
carbonated
some
acidity
on
the
tongue
pretty
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
but
a
bit
too
expensive
not
bad
for
the
price
pours
a
deep
more
brown
then
red
color
with
a
full
head
that
sinks
to
a
nice
lace
that
lasts
has
a
strong
malt
smell
the
malt
predominates
the
initial
taste
ending
with
a
touch
of
fruit
nice
light
mouth
feel
and
easy
going
down
you
can
drink
more
then
one
of
these
for
the
price
i
keep
a
sixpack
of
this
beer
around
to
impress
my
budweiser
drinking
buds
without
spending
a
lot
of
money
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
a
good
one
either
i
remember
liking
it
quite
a
bit
back
when
it
was
murphys
irish
amber
taste
has
some
roasted

mellowed

faint

in

followed
by

mild

along
with

lightly

passably

very
well
attenuated
with
functional
residual
sweetness
at
best
finishes
dry
with
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
very
mild
bready
sweetness
not
particularly
good
but
innocuous
enough
for
easy
quaffing
akin
to
a
killians
red

red

hybrid
but
maybe
a
bit
better
thirst
quenching
at
best
an
irish
red
it
aint
in
conclusion
not
bad
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
brewed
under
license
in
denmark
why
anyway
this
is
a
very
good
looking
beer
that
poured
out
a
very
dark
amber
almost
light
mahogany
color
a
full
rich
ivory
head
capped
the
brew
and
held
on
for
quite
a
while
leaving
some
pretty
darn
good
lacing
the
look
is
better
than
the
nose
or
taste
though
neither
are
bad
the
nose
is
mostly
malt
with
some
light
hops
kicking
in
as
the
head
fades
the
taste
is
mostly
malt
but
balanced
more
than
many
other
irish
brews
there
are
some
slightly
disconcerting
notes
of
metallicity
feel
is
full
smooth
and
crisp
light
but
lingering
aftertaste
after
pouring
this
beer
with
the
color
of
a
golden
amber
with
no
red
hue
what
so
ever
the
smell
and
was
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
a
bitter
hoppy
nature
the
taste
had
a
sort
of
chemical
and
metalic
balance
to
it
not
a
beer
that
i
would
purchase
again
smelling
it
again
it
also
had
an
aroma
of
hair
spray
not
promising
this
brew
pours
a
rather
brown
amber
color
i
found
it
to
be
quite
pleasing
for
some
odd
reason
it
has
a
nice
head
with
good
staying
power
you
can
really
smell
the
full
flavored
hops
the
taste
is
excellent
but
the
malt
flavors
really
are
much
better
if
the
beer
is
served
at
room
temperature
this
is
a
very
good
brew
and
would
really
drink
it
much
more
often
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
f
this
is
a
rather
unoffensive
beer
i
caught
a
unique
taste
towards
the
end
rather
pleasant
that
made
this
beer
stand
out
in
my
mind
a
little
bit
this
unique
taste
wasnt
what
i
would
consider
malty
or
hoppy
it
was
like
a
flat
in
between
those
two
types
of
tastes
there
are
better
beers
for
less
money
good
to
drink
once
a
year
on
st
pats
this
one
pours
a
clear
reddish
tinged
rust
colour
a
thin
but
persistant
head
is
backed
up
by
some
carbonation
and
a
slight
lace
a
thin
malty
nose
is
complimented
by
an
earthy
and
slightly
grassy
hop
aroma
light
toasted
and
biscuity
malt
tastes
are
paired
with
a
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
making
for
a
both
flavorful
and
crisp
refreshing
lager
bits
of
perfumy
and
earthy
hoppiness
abound
from
start
to
finish
not
too
bad
and
quite
drinkable
just
good
enough
to
appeal
to
both
the
mass
swill
drinker
and
the
particular
palate
i
probably
wont
be
revisiting
this
one
though
it
may
be
the
irish
catholic
in
me
but
i
really
like
this
brew
i
consider
it
an
old
stand
by
when
i
go
out
to
a
pub
and
i
get
tired
of
guinness
it
had
a
very
nice
deep
radish
color
with
a
white
head
that
lasted
a
while
the
taste
had
some
undertones
of
citrus
but
a
lot
of
hops
aftertaste
was
smooth
and
rolled
down
the
ole
esophogas
pretty
easily
beer
poured
a
slight
redish
color
not
as
dark
as
you
might
expect
in
a
red
beer
small
amount
of
head
lingered
in
the
glass
smelled
a
bit
like
heineken
but
not
quite
as
skunky
mouthfeel
was
refreshingly
carbonated
a
bit
more
carbonated
than
in
lager
which
is
nice
the
taste
isnt
anything
special
but
is
not
bad
either
rather
average
drinkability
wise
this
is
an
ok
beer
a
couple
of
them
go
down
nicely
but
the
desire
for
more
than
that
just
isnt
there
ill
get
this
again
but
not
in
the
near
future
this
beer
was
served
in
a
green
actually
aqua
glass
which
made
it
hard
to
tell
the
color
of
the
beer
maybe
that
was
just
as
well
because
i
was
roundly
unimpressed
with
this
beer
the
aroma
and
taste
were
bland
the
menu
said
it
had
a
touch
of
malt
and
slight
hops
to
my
taste
i
could
not
detect
much
of
either
it
finished
as
bland
as
it
started
it
was
as
drinkable
as
a
tall
glass
of
water
this
bottle
came
out
of
a
beers
of
the
world
box
set
that
i
received
as
a
gift
this
beer
poured
a
medium
amber
head
was
thick
and
retained
very
well
lacing
was
pretty
good
with
some
nice
sheets
concentrated
at
mid
glass
aroma
was
sharp
and
slightly
cheap
smelling
reminded
me
of
a
macro
almost
taste
was
malty
and
on
the
sweet
side
nothing
really
stood
out
but
it
was
fairly
smooth
thinnish
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
nothing
to
write
home
about
its
not
awful
but
its
hardly
good
either
probably
wont
have
it
again
poured
a
clear
dark
copper
color
with
an
airy
white
foamy
head
aroma
consisted
of
malt
hops
and
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
mouthfeel
is
crisp
yet
smooth
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
smooth
malt
sweetness
of
the
flavor
its
followed
up
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
biscuit
crisp
finish
has
the
perfect
hop
balance
to
it
in
regards
to
the
bitterness
a
very
mild
red
beer
sláinte
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
fades
into
a
nice
amount
of
lace
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
is
a
bit
earthy
and
musty
taste
is
lightly
toasted
sweet
malts
with
a
bit
of
caramel
and
a
slick
oily
hop
finish
a
nice
if
unremarkable
brew
i
have
some
fond
memories
of
sitting
at
a
bar
and
drinking
these
all
day
long
one
st
pattys
day
many
years
ago
a
somewhat
hazy
deep
amber
color
on
the
pour
with
a
pleasant
sized
head
and
oodles
of
fine
lace
the
nose
is
mostly
malt
lightly
sweet
and
pleasing
to
the
senses
start
is
malt
and
sweet
the
top
middling
and
the
finish
nicely
carbonated
with
a
modest
but
pleasant
hop
bite
and
the
typical
dry
lingering
aftertaste
quite
good
in
its
own
right
but
give
me
the
draught
version
which
is
becoming
quite
scarce
here
in
arizona
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
lingers
well
after
the
pour
lots
of
broken
lace
with
slight
carbonation
fairly
strong
aroma
of
toasted
malt
with
some
earthy
character
as
well
taste
begins
with
rich
slightly
sweet
toasted
malts
little
in
the
way
of
hops
finishes
with
mild
earthy
flavors
a
decent
but
unremarkable
amber
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
on
the
nose
there
is
a
decent
sweet
malt
aroma
on
the
palate
decent
malt
flavor
touch
of
caramel
in
there
very
drinkable
brew
lacks
a
well
rounded
flavor
but
good
malt
character
and
very
drinkable

americanstyle

irish

hmmm
seems
a
little
odd
nice
head
but
it
didnt
last
long
amber
color
seemed
thin
a
portent
of
the
rather
watery

with

great
session
beer
the
beer
was
a
dark
brownish
amber
color
that
left
a
white
head
with
some
nice
lace
a
slight
aroma
of
malt
but
barely
even
that
the
flavor
was
of
malt
the
finish
of
is
was
very
light
and
the
beer
seemed
watery
i
was
rather
disappointed
with
this
since
i
was
hoping
this
on
tap
would
be
better
than
the
other
macros
they
had
not
bad
but
just
a
little
bit
watery
in
the
end
no
real
standout
character
i
guess
they
focused
this
beer
to
a
wider
audience
drinkable
nice
reddish
color
fuzzy
off
white

with
red
hints
nice
malty
smell
and
taste
earthy
roastedness
to
it
kinda
slippery
and
slider
but
tastes
pretty
good
alot
of

taste
what
you
expect
i
never
knew
it
was
imported
by
heineken
ok
going
down
maybe
one
at
a
time
havent
really
had
much
in
this
style
to
compare
it
to
nice
deep
copperbrown
in
color
fresh
smelling
of
sweet
malt
with
a
touch
of
carmel
taste
is
similar
somewhat
flat
tasting
but
good
malt
character
run
o
the
mill
irish
amber
kind
of
disappointing
i
liked
murphys
stout
and
thought
id
give
the
amber
a
try
too
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
stout
very
nice
red
ale
ill
buy
again
a
nice
smooth
red
ale
smoother
and
very
so
slightly
sweeter
than
killians
ill
buy
again
not
very
good
but
who
knows
how
well
the
restaurant
maintains
its
tap
lines
i
do
give
the
longhorn
in
greenville
credit
for
serving
a
local
brew
overall
not
the
most
tip
top
irish
red
ive
had
but
definitely
a
solid
traditional
recipe
it
just
needs
a
little
more
polish
and
finesse
in
its
current
state
especially
with
the
diacetyl
factor
it
reminds
me
of
an
award
winning
homebrew
in
a
small
regional
competition
no
idea
how
old
this
is
but
its
a
gusher
took
5
minutes
to
see
what
color
it
was
its
amber
with
a
billowing
cream
head
aroma
is
metallic
with
nutty
notes
and
specialty
malt
fruitiness
flavor
is
also
metallic

not
a

by
any

definitely
one

nothing
on
this
brew
really
stood
out
to
me
while
it
was
a

brew
from
the

it
wasnt
overly
memorable
worth
trying
if
you
havent
done
so
or
if
you
see
it
on

and
want
something
a

the

not
as

as
some

however
this
is
kind
of
baffling
the

is
weak
and
powerless
tastes
good
at
the
start
of
each

but
totally
falls
apart
by
the
finish
i
wish
that
werent
the
case
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
decent
as
is
theres
no
need
for

to

not
much

use

even
though
thomas
creek
considers
river
falls
red
ale
to
be
their
flagship
beer
its
more
of
a
sturdy
little
tugboat
it
would
also
be
best
if
they
took
the
tagline
sink
the
status
quo
off
the
label
because
this
stuff
is
the
very
definition
of
the
status
quo
o
if
you
a
relatives
that
have
no
idea
what
a
good
beer
is
and
you
want
to
fool
them
into
thinking
you
do
then
give
them
this
this
should
have
a
coors
lable
on
it
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
really
wish
the
metal
wasnt
there
would
help
the
beer
a
lot
if
that
aspect
could
be
fixed
d
a
pleasant
red
ale
for
sure
but
too
plain
and
subtle
to
generate
much
interest
dvery
crisp
and
refreshing
a
nice
example
of
a
red
ale
easily
a
23
pint
beer
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
the
bartender
told
me
it
was
one
of
his
favorites
i
thought
it
was
good
but
not
a
fave
being
called
a
red
ale
i
thought
there
would
be
more
red
to
it
more
copper
looking
than
amber
very
decent
drinkability
i
think
a
lot
of
people
would
enjoy
this
but
there
was
nothing
special
for
me
to
point
out
coppery
amber
with
a
dense
sand
colored
head
toasted
malt
and
subdued
floral
hop
notes
in
the
aroma
sweet
malt
well
balanced
with
mild
herbal
hoppiness
flavors
of
toffee
and
candied
orange
peel
with
a
mild
breadiness
and
soft
herbal
hop
bittering
well
balanced
and
spot
on
for
the
style
medium
bodied
and
smooth
an
easy
drinker
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
somewhat
lighter
amber
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
fizzy
head
on
it
that
dropped
off
rather
quickly
it
leaves
a
little
lacing
lighter
but
decent
nose
some
floral
and
toffee
notes
the
taste
is
ok
a
little
lighter
in
the
body
mildly
bitter
with
just
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
very
faint
roastiness
decent
enough
but
nothing
special
right
on
target
here
its
a
style
in
which
you
dont
want
massive
complexities
clinging
on
the
palate
or
flexed
flavors
bursting
at
the
seams
balanced
and
very
drinkablenot
a
flaw
showing
not
much
body
and
that
metallic
tang
continues
into
the
aftertaste
averting
you
from
trying
another
i
left
five
of
the
bottles
from
the
sixpack
in
the
hotel
4
0
d
after
looking
at
the
average
for
this
im
not
quite
sure
why
everyone
hates
it
its
a
solid
red
ale
that
tastes
more
like
a
brown
ale
id
happily
drink
this
again
drinkability
overall
is
pretty
good
i
cant
get
this
beer
in
ky
picked
up
in
asheville
nc
but
would
buy
again
if
the
price
was
right
my
sam
adams
perfect
pint
is
a
little
disappointed
but
i
suspect
a
fresher
offering
would
be
worthwhile
as
a
tailgate
beer
you
know
something
that
quenches
ones
thirst
while
lowering
inhibitions
without
feeling
like
a
waste
easy
drinker
but
just
not
worth
the
effort
pours
a
glorious
reddish
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
largely
a
very
fruity
berrylike
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
is
more
balanced
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
but
the
sweet
caramel
malts
are
still
a
bit
dominant
but
not
quite
as
fruity
as
the
nose
would
suggest
medium
bodied
but
it
feels
a
bit
thin
because
of
a
fine
carbonation
that
is
almost
reminiscent
of
an
adjunctlager
by
no
means
am
i
comparing
this
to
a
killians
though
as
this
one
has
a
nice
malt
sweetness
but
is
also
fairly
balanced
making
it
a
good
but
not
great
beer
overall
impression
not
something
id
seek
out
necessarily
but
a
pretty
solid
offering
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
2
finger
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
grainy
it
has
a
bready
flavor
to
it
not
real
sweet
the
finish
is
crisp
a
medium
bodied
quaffer
imo
this
is
more
of
an
amber
ale
but
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
drinkability
decent
beer
but
it
needed
a
bit
more
bitterness
imho
the
beer
was
easy
to
quaff
seems
that
this
beer
was
mishandled
by
the
distributor
or
the
storekeep
its
a
shame
because
this
is
my
first
encounter
with
this
brewery
its
not
their
fault
and
ill
try
to
find
some
more
of
this
beer
and
their
other
offerings
again
and
revisit
pours
with
a
solid
head
of
cream
colored
head
pretty

runs
down

without

watery
the
strength
of
the
caramel
and
roasted
coffee
is
out
of
balance
with
the
whole
hence
the
nose
is
very
dominated
by
the

much
to
begin
with
this
was
a
tasty
light
and
crisp
session
ale
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
that
it
lacked
the
toasted
malt
character
found
in
most
examples
of
this
style
nevertheless
it
was
definitely
worth
a
try
label
on
the
bottle
says
river
falls
red
ale
pours
a
mostly
clear
copperorange
body
with
a
medium
beige
head
good
retention
and
plenty
of
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
restrained
aroma
has
hints
of
toasted
caramel
and
vague
hops
light
medium
body
has
medium
carbonation
taste
is
malty
mostly
caramel
but
not
overly
sweet
hop
bitterness
is
restrained
but
balances
well
a
nice
red
ale
that
goes
down
well
unassuming
but
nicely
put
together
with
no
obvious
flaws
drinkability
not
bad
a
bit
better
than
average
drinkability
better
with
food
than
by
itself
this
could
be
sessionable
more
likely
on
tap
but
ill
need
an
appetite
to
work
with
d
i
didnt
find
this
one
particularly
drinkable
the
taste
wasnt
complex
and
was
fairly
uninteresting
more
bitter
than
usual
for
style
not
something
ill
be
going
back
to
biscuity
and
doughy
malts
in
the
aroma
which
morphs
a
bit
into
a
woody
and
toasted
nuts
taste
nice
dry
and
crisp
finish
if
in
south
carolina
id
say
go
for
a
sixer
anytime
i
was
bumming
i
only
had
one
poured
a
nice
hazyorange
with
no
head
and
some
decent
lacing
nice
streams
of
carbonation
coming
from
th
botom
of
the
glass
smell
was
light
grainy
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
taste
really
caught
me
off
guard
came
off
vey
sour
hints
of
grapes
and
pears
more
complex
then
i
thought
very
light
and
well
carbonated
and
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
tis
wasalot
more
of
a
beer
then
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
seems
like
they
have
done
a
bit
of
exploring
with
this
very
complex
and
a
good
drinker
pours
a
reddish
orange
with
only
a
lacy
head
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
smell
is
sugary
and
dry
malts
and
marmalade
some
hops
in
the
background
it
smells
thicker
than
it
tastes
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
outside
of
the
smell
though
the
mouthfeel
is
sturdy
at
first
but
not
much
after
that
it
doesnt
hold
up
over
time
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
better
red
ales
out
there
seems
like
theyre
on
the
right
track
but
they
need
to
change
something
somewhere
in
the
process
or
ingredients
to
make
this
highly
quaffable
glad
i
only
sprang
for
a
single
i
get
the
feeling
that
thomas
creek
didnt
set
out
to
redefine
the
style
with
this
beer
but
rather
settled
on
something
very
average
and
safe
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
got
little
to
help
it
stand
out
from
the
pack
either
i
do
like
the
fact
that
its
brewed
in
my
state
folks
in
sc
need
all
the
help
they
can
get
smell
was
sweet
malts
period
in
fact
this
reminded
me
of
a
breakfast
cereal
taste
was
a
bit
bitter
up
front
with
some
dry
malt
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
and
lacked
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
very
average
offering
got
this
on
tap
while
waiting
at
the
airport
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
orange
tones
had
a
one
finger
off
white
cap
that
dissipated
to
almost
nothing
and
leaving
very
slight
lacings
up
sides
of
airport
plastic
cup
aroma
is
caramel
cloves
citrus
coriander
and
hops
flavor
is
a
little
watered
down
but
the
light
caramel
malitness
comes
through
with
medium
hop
bitterness
slight
citrus
undertones
and
a
little
spice
and
slight
pepperyness
has
a
hoppy
earthy
aftertaste
that
doesnt
quite
agree
body
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
little
on
the
watery
side
in
some
ways
this
beer
while
average
is
fairly
decent
and
yet
runofthemill
with
warts
this
doesnt
cut
it
with
me
this
isnt
something
id
want
to
drink
again
as
there
are
much
better
similar
products
nevertheless
thanks
timtheenchanta
for
the
bottle
12
ounce
brown
bottle
from
a
local
brewer
in
greenville
sc
pours
a
hazy
dark
orangeamber
color
with
a
good
sized
head
that
quickly
dissipates
minimual
lacing
nice
malty
aroma
with
some
spiceness
cinnamon
in
the
background
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
little
spicy
flavor
and
very
little
ho
bitterness
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
one
i
would
seek
out
i
prefer
their
amber
ale
over
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
amber
burntorange
with
an
extreamly
frothy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
and
a
little
film
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
mostly
malty
with
sweet
aromas
and
the
chararacteric
malt
smell
that
seems
to
come
along
with
all
thomas
creek
beers
the
taste
exhibits
the
same
characteristics
as
the
smell
this
is
mostly
sweet
malts
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
with
a
nice
thickness
there
is
also
a
slight
dryness
associated
with
it
overall
average
on
drinkability
that
characteristic
maltiness
that
seems
to
be
consistent
throughout
all
thomas
creek
beers
just
isnt
to
my
liking
uf
nose
is
sweet
malts
caramel
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
throughout
with
hops
pushing
back
to
balance
and
leave
just
a
bit
of
bitternes
in
the
sweet
finish
mouth
is
full
and
modertately
carbonated
drinks
rather
easily
would
be
nice
to
have
another
tonight
this
slightly
hazy
deepamber
ale
has
a
wonderful
creamy
offwhite
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
about
the
glass
its
malty
and
sweet
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
yeasty
fruitiness
thin
streams
of
steadily
rising
bubbles
reveal
its
moderate
carbonation
and
its
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
dextrinous
medium
body
sweetish
caramel
and
toffeelike
malt
dominates
the
flavor
which
is
laced
with
floral
and
delicately
citrusy
hops
and
backed
by
a
firm
bitterness
a
basic
approachable
and
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
amber
certainly
there
are
better
out
there
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
pretty
easily
drinkability
pleasant
drinker
a
decent
example
of
a
style
that
i
rarely
seek
out
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
total
wine
in
charleston
sc
add
some
additional
bittering
to
the
flavor
to
tip
the
balance
toward
bitter
and
this
could
be
a
real
winner
cloudy
amber
red
in
color
the
head
was
hard
to
judge
as
i
tasted
this
at
a
festival
in
a
2
5
oz
shot
glass
immediately
pick
up
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
that
dominates
any
other
scent
the
taste
was
clean
sweet
malt
with
a
very
robust
lingering
finish
with
average
carbonation
i
agree
with
the
other
reviewers
in
that
this
is
much
better
that
other
american
reds
a
great
improvement
over
their
pilsner
nice
looking
slightly
hazy
amberred
decent
tan
head
aroma
is
similar
to
sweet
wort
with
some
faint
leafy
hops
flavor
is
predominately
malt
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
sweetish
and
biscuity
an
easy
going
hop
finish
makes
for
a
decent
red
a
good
crossover
brew
for
someone
discovering
better
beer
was
a
good
beer
try
it
o
this
fits
the
irish
red
ale
description
but
imo
this
would
be
better
with
a
bit
less
sweetnes
mediumlight
body
lightish
carbonation
dry
finish
heck
dry
middle
dry
beginning
even
not
harsh
but
dry
relatively
easy
to
drink
pours
an
amzing
clear
reddish
color
with
a
nice
head
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
that
feels
great
on
the
palate
i
get
a
touch
of
bread
and
dried
fruit
on
the
nose
carbonation
is
definately
the
dominant
trait
at
first
mouthfeel
the
bitterness
of
some
hops
is
very
present
and
i
get
a
touch
of
nutty
earthiness
as
it
drinks
overall
a
great
refresher
for
a
hot
day
overall
nice
red
ale
the
taste
is
sophisticated
enough
that
its
not
boring
should
be
a
crowd
pleaser
for
we
need
a
lot
of
good
beer
thats
not
expensive
or
weird
type
events
overall
drinkability
slainté
to
this
one
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
amber
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
clingy
white
head
aromas
of
roast
caramel
and
nut
sweetness
with
hints
of
smoke
flavors
are
richly
sweet
and
roasty
with

and
sugary
notes
smooth
light

with

clean

finish
with
floral
and

left
behind
notes
my
2nd
maine
beer
in
an
hour
this
is
a
nice
ale
well
balanced
interesting
enough
to
be
distinguishable
would
drink
again
overall
a
malt
focused
beer
with
a
nice
dry
finish
an
easy
to
drink
food
friendly
beer
it
has
the
caramel
flavor
but
lacks
the
initial
sweetness
for
the
style
which
just
fine
by
me
but
sort
of
forces
me
to
hold
back
on
a
point
there
o
this
is
an
excellent
red
ale
with
big
flavor
i
love
the
balance
between
the
rich
flavors
and
the
crisp
finish
of
hop
character
wonderfully
heady
pour
into
a
14oz
pilsner
glass
nice
hazy
ruddy
red
color
subdued
sweet
malt
nose
with
a
little
hop
nuance
to
get
the
nose
hairs
to
stand
up
nice
hop
character
up
front
and
on
the
finish
with
malt
sweetness
balance
the
bitterness
dry
finish
sturdy
mouth
feel
i
would
say
this
is
the
poster
child
for
medium
bodied
not
fizzy
and
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
wonderfully
easy
drinking
red
ale
whose
flavors
are
an
easy
all
season
sell
o
a
good
session
brew
here
but
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
like
to
see
o
this
is
a
very
good
irish
red
and
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
an
excellent
red
ale
nice
malt
flavors
meshed
with
a
nice
light
hoppiness
along
with
a
good
aroma
i
could
easily
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
with
friends
highly
recommend
if
you
have
the
chance
to
try
it
dr
a
very
drinkable
red
ale
with
no
bold
flavours
or
any
unique
characteristics
quite
pleasant
a
great
session
beer
by
irish
standards
id
like
to
try
it
on
draught
at
a
pub
the
toasted
malt
in
particular
is
quite
nice
so
so
sad
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
east
coast
faves
then
it
disappeared
for
a
while
and
tonight
i
paid
9
for
a
six
mistake
used
to
be
a
fresh
tasting
ale
and
tonight
it
was
a
runofthemill
shipyard
brewie
ringwood
yeast
city
major
disappointment
overall
i
finished
this
before
i
knew
it
so
i
guess
it
cant
be
bad
i
just
barely
noticed
i
was
drinking
a
beer
im
just
not
one
for
red
ales
but
it
wasnt
bad
i
was
happily
surprised
by
this
beer
i
could
enjoy
this
one
with
a
good
meal
or
around
the
campfire
straight
from
the
bottle
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
irish
red
this
one
comes
highly
recommended
goes
very
well
with
lobster
chowder
lobster
rolls
and
boiled
lobster
with
potato
salad
and
corn
on
the
cob
and
melted
butter
drinkability
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
a
great
irish
red
would
easily
have
this
beer
again
no
problem
ran
into
this
at
jamesons
tavern
in
freeport
me
it
had
a
light
clear
copper
color
with
very
little
white
head
that
disappeared
leaving
no
discernable
lacing
the
aroma
is
cider
malt
mash
and
light
grass
hops
the
flavor
is
lemony
hopped
malt
with
lots
of
caramel
cardboard
lightly
carbonated
medium
bodied
a
bit
limp
in
feel
fairly
drinkable
but
not
great
enough
to
warrant
more
than
a
couple
i
think
value
perhaps
the
greatest
thing
about
this
fine
red
ale
i
paid
6
99
for
a
six
pack
at
the
grocery
store
hard
to
beat
that
friend
of
mine
passed
this
one
along
from
the
beerofthemonth
club
poured
a
rich
amber
with
ruby
highlights
small
tan
head
that
persisted
bready
maltiness
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
hops
caramel
malt
sweetness
but
balanced
more
toward
woodygrassy
hop
flavored
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
with
the
hop
flavor
carrying
through
in
the
aftertaste
light
to
medium
body
smooth
w
touch
of
resins
in
finish
gentle
to
moderate
carbonation
can
be
tingly
but
also
moments
of
creaminess
drinkability
some
of
the
bitter
and
metallic
flavors
are
a
little
offputting
and
limit
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
d
as
stated
before
a
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
id
drink
another
poured
with
a
very
small
offwhite
head
body
is
mostly
clear
with
a
trace
of
haziness
and
a
dark
amber
color
good
aroma
average
maltiness
present
some
caramel
and
light
yeast
great
on
the
palate
smooth
mediumbody
with
a
creamy
texture
soft
carbonation
progresses
well
to
the
terrific
flavor
caramel
and
malt
nice
and
creamy
with
a
mediumduration
finish
the
beer
does
not
look
like
anything
special
but
its
easiest
one
of
the
best
irish
reds
ive
tasted
could
drink
this
all
day
for
sure
very
nice
flavor
a
lot
more
dry
and
bitter
hops
than
i
expected
malt
sweetness
balances
things
somewhat
though
the
finish
is
definitely
dry
woody
and
biscuity
touch
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
light
but
very
refreshing
overall
a
very
good
red
ale
and
a
great
offering
from
casco
bay
a
wellbalanced
cacophony
of
malts
and
hops
greet
the
the
palate
and
ride
out
smoothly
bitterness
is
kept
at
a
moderate
level
allowing
some
fruitier
flavors
to
develop
like
red
grapes
and
sour
apple
the
maltiness
is
slightly
sweet
and
suggests
caramel
and
toasted
grains
while
the
hops
assert
themselves
mostly
on
the
finish
as
they
chime
in
with
a
fresh
greenery
of
resin
and
floral
notes
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
the
active
carbonation
level
turns
the
creamy
mouthfeel
into
a
zesty
popping
finish
all
in
all
a
very
flavorful
very
wellcrafted
irish
red
that
i
would
be
happy
to
try
again
nice
job
casco
bay
very
thick
mouthfeel
a
nice
substantial
beer
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
feels
about
right
with
the
heavyish
body
couldnt
go
on
drinking
these
all
night
be
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
a
couple
of
watching
the
game
with
the
guys
dyeah
its
drinkable
but
not
overly
refreshing
nor
challengingrewarding
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
with
this
much
effervescence
a
nice
fullbodied
presence
very
drinkable
d
very
easy
to
drink
low
abv
which
makes
this
enjoyable
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
nice
mahogany
color
with
great
clarity
the
head
was
a
thin
skim
of
khaki
foam
that
did
not
retain
well
the
lacing
was
equally
unimpressive
the
aroma
was
a
good
blend
of
a
semisweet
lightly
fruity
malt
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
some
hop
bitterness
the
flavors
were
at
first
a
flash
of
sweetness
that
then
became
more
roasted
malt
before
going
into
a
pleasant
bitterness
hints
of
wood
and
a
long
roasted
malt
finish
yum
the
body
was
medium
the
carbonation
perfect
and
the
mouthfeel
quite
good
for
the
style
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
it
would
be
topclass
if
only
it
looked
a
little
better
another
mainer
from
the
botmc
very
malty
with
trace
hops
on
the
smell
some
butterscotch
some
peanut
brittle
pours
to
a
deep
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
taste
is
malty
throughout
with
a
little
bitterness
starting
in
the
middle
becoming
a
little
more
predominant
in
the
the
end
then
fading
away
to
a
malty
finish
with
only
hints
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
viscous
with
the
carbonation
perfect
to
enjoy
the
flavor
of
this
brew
this
is
an
excellent
ale
not
to
mention
amber
ale
good
flavor
complexity
not
a
constant
balance
throughout
but
a
flipflopping
between
bitter
and
sweet
i
will
have
to
get
more
to
keep
on
hand
i
really
dig
this
beer
and
would
drink
more
if
i
had
more
dvery
very
drinkable
this
is
one
seems
like
it
will
hold
up
in
the
long
haul
without
letting
you
down
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
a
few
cases
of
this
on
my
way
back
from
maine
nice
brew
goes
well
with
food
or
alone
as
a
sipper
enjoy
if
local
try
to
find
if
not
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
nice
halfinch
head
some
lacing
smell
is
light
malt
with
grassy
elements
nice
malty
floral
taste
a
hint
of
roses
a
bit
different
from
the
usual
red
ale
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
good
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
pretty
darn
good
example
of
the
style
i
wish
it
were
more
readily
available
around
here
i
would
probably
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
i
had
the
chance
cant
really
say
a
bad
thing
about
this
brew
other
than
its
an
exceptional
brew
in
a
category
mired
by
numerous
clones
this
red
is
one
to
reach
for
however
beer
poured
red
with
an
off
white
head
that
is
sustaining
pretty
well
nose
had
a
hint
of
hops
upon
opening
but
is
primarily
malty
half
way
down
the
glass
taste
is
quite
nice
very
malty
with
hints
of
biscuit
and
nut
beer
finishes
with
a
light
citrus
hop
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
quite
full
for
the
style
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
red
ale
with
an
emphasis
on
the
malts
a
nice
departure
from
the
hoppier
reds
tasted
on
22108
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
reddish
in
color
and
had
a
bit
if
a
tan
head
the
beer
was
malty
in
smell
and
rick
kightly
in
taste
the
beer
was
nothing
special
but
was
still
a
goodbeer
i
thought
in
fact
it
was
enough
that
i
will
buy
again
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
after
the
smell
i
never
thought
this
beer
could
recover
but
it
managed
to
pick
its
mouthpiece
up
off
the
canvas
and
get
back
into
the
fight
then
was
knocked
out
due
to
the
stink
there
was
something
unpleasent
about
the
first
half
a
second
the
taste
hit
the
mouth
all
in
all
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
not
the
best
either
hooray
for
stink
beer
poured
smooth
with
a
slight
film
of
suds
just
enough
to
cover
the
surface
it
looked
a
translucent
chocolaty
orange
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
when
i
smelled
this
were
autumn
leaves
nice
balanced
flavor
that
starts
with
the
malts
and
ended
with
a
moderate
amount
of
hops
showing
thru
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
drinking
beer
i
could
defiantly
put
down
the
additional
two
that
came
with
beer
of
the
month
club
but
then
id
be
all
out
drinkability
goes
down
nice
and
easy
and
has
just
the
right
balance
into
a
twelveounce
mug
this
is
a
nice
reddishmahogany
color
with
a
small
but
firm
head
on
top
good
malty
aroma
a
little
toasty
a
little
caramel
the
palate
is
firmly
maltdriven
with
a
crisp
biscuity
toastiness
backed
by
some
sweet
caramel
just
like
the
aroma
implies
bitterness
is
moderate
and
hop
flavor
undetectable
but
this
beer
is
mainly
about
the
malt
so
it
hardly
matters
neutral
yeast
character
as
well
nice
creamy
texture
and
a
medium
body
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
colored
head
that
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
of
nice
roasted
malts
and
layered
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
sweet
fruity
smell
it
tastes
of
deep
roasted
malts
as
a
nice
base
layered
with
an
excellent
sweet
fruity
taste
perhaps
of
apples
but
the
bottle
says
peaches
then
finished
with
a
nice
citrisy
hop
bitterness
it
has
a
really
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
and
an
excellent
drinkability
definately
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
d
full
flavored
easy
drinkin
great
session
beer
taste
was
fairly
well
balanced
between
the
caramel
malt
and
the
hops
and
citrus
bit
buttery
but
not
too
much
a
pretty
good
red
ale
offering
pours
a
fiery
redorange
sugary
sweet
aroma
very
nicely
balanced
caramelly
with
strong
hints
of
roasted
grain
just
how
i
like
my
red
ales
thick
and
smooth
but
with
an
interesting
smoky
finish
excellent
i
hope
i
stumble
upon
this
one
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
sometime
drinkability
a
very
pleasant
dark
colored
but
light
bodied
brew
perfect
while
enjoying
down
home
maine
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
keep
drinking
consistently
for
an
evening
or
to
drink
with
a
nice
meal
casco
bay
riptide
red
ale
has
to
be
classified
as
a
pleasant
surprise
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
brewery
or
this
beer
what
i
got
was
a
delicious
irish
red
that
favors
the
bold
end
of
the
style
spectrum
rather
than
the
wimpy
one
thanks
to
jrdegriselles
for
the
opportunity
note
disregard
the
placement
of
the
pts
in
the
score
same
here
the
label
was
hard
to
read
i
think
it
says
062006
stamped
on
the
side
nice
amber
red
color
to
it
lots
of
head
when
i
poured
it
in
a
glass
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
a
red
ale
first
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
this
company
located
in
maine
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
best
before
102206
stamped
on
the
label
i
think
the
date
was
difficult
to
read
this
class
of
beers
always
look
beautiful
to
me
and
this
was
no
exception
red
garnet
in
color
with
a
nice
medium
head
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
breadlike
taste
with
some
tang
to
it
an
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
pours
a
dark
rich
amber
with
a
giant
tan
foamy
head
a
really
beautiful
beer
the
smell
is
a
nice
sweet
malt
floral
and
maybe
vanilla
aroma
the
taste
is
rich
and
creamy
with
a
nutty
sweet
malt
and
a
vanilla
or
cinnamon
aftertaste
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
making
this
a
truely
quality
beer
caramel
amber
appearance
a
little
cloudy
but
nothing
to
worry
about
small
faint
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
sweet
and
sugarry
with
some
hops
the
body
gives
an
initial
hops
impression
that
dominates
the
flavor
profile
without
being
bitter
a
little
bitterness
lingers
on
the
finish
but
then
it
goes
clean
a
refreshing
effervescent
warm
weather
brew
maybe
a
little
too
heavy
to
drink
in
large
quantities
but
still
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
for
a
while
and
im
glad
i
did
fullflavored
wellbalanced
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
within
the
style
a
very
nice
red
color
is
spot
on
and
it
sustains
a
nice
cap
but
leaves
little
lacing
smells
of
piney
hops
layered
over
a
good
malt
driven
beer
it
taste
is
a
little
bready
but
a
good
malt
character
with
little
sweetness
and
nice
cutting
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
a
good
red
and
a
great
local
thing
to
have
i
just
dont
live
in
maine
but
if
i
did
this
would
be
a
sesion
beer
for
me
easy
body
for
sipping
or
slamming
rip
tide
red
poured
a
cloudy
but
distinct
red
color
the
cloudy
is
a
sign
this
beer
has
not
had
the
yeast
filtered
out
thats
good
the
grain
husks
from
the
mash
that
poured
from
the
bottle
with
the
beer
was
a
little
sloppy
on
the
part
of
the
brewery
though
the
smell
was
light
and
had
caramel
notes
with
not
much
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
pleasant
and
light
with
a
malt
base
a
slight
caramel
aftertaste
and
a
pleasant
hop
character
the
mouthfeel
was
good
not
too
light
but
not
heavy
very
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
but
it
is
a
good
beer
smells
was
hoppy
with
floral
undertones
taste
was
rather
below
average
which
disappointed
me
since
i
thought
thered
be
more
here
there
was
a
certain
element
of
the
yeast
i
believe
that
didnt
settle
well
with
my
palate
i
cant
really
recommend
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
awful
medium
bodied
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
light
crispness
at
the
start
the
finish
is
slightly
crisp
and
caramel
ride
the
tongue
for
a
few
seconds
after
swallowing
great
drinkability
very
enjoyable
beer
deep
reddish

and

clung

in
patches
roasted

and
woodiness
floral
note
sweet

taste
with
a
slight

push
at
back

and
a
little
fruitiness
thrown
in
slowly
diminishing
balanced
finish
great
refreshing
mouthfeel
a
drinking
beer
for
sure
couldve
had
a
whole
pitcher
casco
bays
riptide
ale
has
a
medium
froathy
head
that
seemed
to
stay
in
the
pitcher
for
most
of
the
session
with
a
nice
golden
brown
color
the
color
seems
to
seperate
towards
the
bottom
the
smell
is
a
nice
mixture
of
sweet
malts
and
hops
with
a
fruity
aromatic
smell
the
taste
was
nice
mellow
hops
with
a
smooth
aftertaste
the
red
ale
is
full
of
flavor
it
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
has
some
nice
bitters
in
the
aftertaste
however
the
bitters
disapate
quickly
not
as
rich
as
some
other
irish
red
ales
but
definately
a
good
choice
thanks
to
brewguru
the
aroma
is
a
well
blended
treat
of
malts
and
hops
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
quick
dose
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
followed
by
a
direct
but
not
overpowering
shot
of
hop
the
mouth
is
left
with
a
slight
grainy
dryness
that
leaves
the
mouth
crisp
and
refreshed
a
nice
irish
red
indeed
drinkability
holds
up
well
anytime
pours
with
a
twofinger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
clear
amber
color
medium
bodied
and
medium
carbonation
hoppy
nose
starts
as
a
mix
of
malt
and
hops
but
finishes
hoppy
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
the
brewer
says
5
different
malts
and
3
hop
varietals
carefully
blended
results
in
a
perfect
balance
but
the
hops
dominate
1

for
a
12
oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
medium
ruby
red
color
with
three
fingers
of
offwhite
head
there
is
lots
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
balanced
with
lots
of
sweet
maltiness
and
a
great
dose
of
hops
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
malty
at
first
and
fairly
sweet
a
little
bit
of
tart
cherry
tones
down
the
sweetness
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
nice
and
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
smooth
for
a
red
ale
the
drinkability
is
great
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
beer
the
beer
gushes
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
slightly
beclouded
copper
color
with
the
head
portly
in
size
and
frothy
in
texture
the
color
a
light
tan
with
the
resultant
lace
a
fine
covering
upon
the
glass
nose
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
crisp
and
clean
to
the
senses
start
is
slightly
sweet
a
decent
malt
profile
with
the
top
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
is
pertinently
acidic
with
the
hops
mild
and
pleasant
in
their
spiciness
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
a
drinkable
beer
certainly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
ales
i
encountered
on
the
maine
coast
very
well
done
this
is
a
great
tasting
well
balanced
red
ale
that
id
like
to
find
on
tap
soon
poured
a
bright
and
snazzy
clear
copper
in
color
with
a
thick
and
longlasting
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
of
the
glass
aromas
are
surprisingly
hoppy
always
a
nice
thing
for
this
hophead
theres
a
mixture
of
floral
and
grassy
hops
mixed
in
with
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
flavor
too
was
hoppy
nice
dose
of
malty
sweetness
keeps
this
one
in
check
what
was
most
interesting
with
this
was
the
pronounced
chocolate
flavor
that
came
in
at
the
end
not
too
overmalted
and
that
is
a
great
thing
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
is
a
dollop
of
chocolate
on
your
tongue
quite
tasty
and
one
that
id
seek
out
again
the
riptide
red
is
a
spectacular
example
of
what
a
red
should
be
a
definite
must
if
you
ever
are
near
maine
this
is
a
very
drinkable
amber
ale
and
i
would
suggest
this
beer
for
someone
trying
to
find
a
beer
to
style
the
color
is
a
little
off
but
other
than
that
it
is
a
great
ale
this
will
stand
up
well
and
not
get
tiring
if
youre
having
a
couple
a
big
thanks
to
noclueaboutbeer
for
hauling
this
one
out
to
kansas
all
the
way
from
connecticut
not
my
style
but
i
enjoy
the
richness
of
the
malt
its
almost
like
an
unsweetened
caramel
short

makes
this
what
a
red
ale
should
be
highly
recommended
thanks
johnnyp
a
tasty
brew
although
the
butterscotch
flavor
was
a
bit
overpowering
whether
it
was
actually
the
beer
or
the
lines
were
dirty
i
have
no
idea
ill
have
to
give
a
bottle
of
this
a
shot
as
ive
never
seen
it
on
tap
in
ct
on
tap
at
the
glb
what
better
place
to
sample
a
fresh
maine
beer
medium
amberreddish
color
more
red
than
brown
in
color
glowing
shiny
color
nice
bubbly
beige

medium

malt
smells
sweet
candy
smells
taste
was
full
of
rich
sweet
carmel
taste
candy
and
a
slight
bitter
snap
to
finish
hops
were
way
in
the
back
and
very
sublte
all
about
a
nice
smooth
malty
sweetness
here
however
there
was
no
feeling
of
slick
sweetness
or
aritificial
amber
ale
tastes
that
are
so
common
for
the
style
medium
to
full
bodied
this
would
compliment
a
lobsta
or
serve
as
a
nice
autumn
treat
right
up
there
with
the
rogue
american
amber
in
my
opinion
a
very
good
red
ale
this
stuff
pours
red
i
think
the
hummingbirds
went
after
it
i
savoured
its
light
floral
slightly
tart
and
clearly
hoppy
smell
on
my
back
porch
in
maine
i
was
enticed
as
the
tan
head
receded
i
took
a
sip
and
discovered
a
smokey
citrus
taste
like
a
pink
grapefruit
aged
in
an
oak
cask
its
a
different
and
intriguing
brew
a
third
sip
and
im
still
working
on
describing
the
aftertaste
just
a
bit
bitter
but
not
distressingly
so
a
good
brew
i
recommend
it
ill
have
to
have
more
of
this
pours
a
deep
redamber
good
sized
tan
head
and
leaves
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
caramel
and
strong
on
the
bitter
floral

flavor
starts
with
the
caramel
middle
and
end
are
dominated
by
the
hops
with
a
little
hint
of
chocolate
sneaking
in
somewhere
medium
body
easy
drinking
perfect
for
a
session
around
the
campfire
in
maine
this
summer
that
said
if
it
is
the
only
beer
that
you
are
drinking
in
one
session
it
should
go
over
well
enough
i
did
make
the
mistake
of
drinking
about
13
of
a
bottle
and
then
taking
a
swig
of
brand
b
red
ale
before
finishing
my
own
initially
after
brand
b
red
ale
it
tasted
like
well
nothing
but
gradually
the
flavors
came
back
in
as
i
drank
more
and
it
came
to
taste
like

hop

facilitates
a

thanks
mainebeerman
for
the
marc
beer
fund
donation
i
had
never
heard
of
this
beer
but
when
i
was
at
the
springhouse
drafting
room
i
saw
this
and
decided
to
give
a
tryand
iam
glad
i
did
poured
a
deep
copperred
color
with
minimal
headsmell
was
roasty
and
somewhat
fruity
taste
was
very
roasted
and
a
little
chocolaty
with
some
fruity
flavors
also
comin
thrui
think
that
this
is
the
way
a
true
red
should
taste
but
many
cant
live
up
to
the
style
this
one
sure
did
live
up
to
the
stylemaybe
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
i
have
hadreally
well
done
this
product
tastes
like
what
i
would
expect
a
quality
irish
red
ale
to
taste
pours
a
bright
red
with
a
nice
creamy
head
the
initial
taste
seems
to
emphasize
the
malt
characteristics
of
the
product
while
the
finish
places
more
emphasis
on
the
hops
smooth
mouthfeel
and
pleasant
and
lingering
aftertaste
i
would
expect
that
this
might
become
casco
bays
flagship
product
despite
the
brewerys
highly
acclaimed
and
justifiably
so
pilsener
wish
it
were
available
in
nh
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
red
highlight
it
was
slightly
opaque
and
fairly
well
carbonated
the
head
that
was
produced
was
a
medium
beigetan
color
that
was
thick
and
creamy
some
chunky
parts
mixed
in
the
foam
and
seemed
to
last
fairly
well
the
lace
that
it
produced
stared
off
as
sticky
sheets
then
slid
right
into
a
decent
lace
that
was
sparse
in
some
areas
and
chunky
in
others
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
strong
at
points
and
slight
in
others
i
nosed
floral
hops
sweet
malts
chocolate
citrus
fruit
roasted
malt
coconut
nuts
and
some
bread
surprisingly
complex
and
diverse
aromas
from
this
beer
the
tastes
that
flowed
over
my
tongue
were
of
bitter
hops
flowers
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
creamy
chocolate
earth
tones
biscuits
and
a
slight
alcohol
warmth
at
the
end
and
it
left
a
slight
hop
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
it
was
medium
to
full
bodied
the
warmer
this
beer
got
the
more
the
flavors
and
aromas
increased
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
would
get
again
not
my
first
and
certainly
not
my
last
a
slightly
hazy
deep
amber
body
is
capped
by
a
frothy
ivory
head
that
drops
shortly
to
a
creamy
collar
and
light
surface
foam
it
holds
well
and
leaves
some
thin
transient
lace
throughout
the
pint
bold
floral
hops
welcome
you
and
a
sweet
biscuity
maltiness
becomes
apparent
with
a
little
more
nosing
around
its
mediumfull
body
combines
with
a
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
to
leave
it
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
rich
without
being
overbearing
its
biscuity
and
gently
caramelish
malt
provides
a
perfect
counterbalance
to
its
vibrant
citrusy
and
mildly
resinous
hop
flavor
a
solid
bitterness
anchors
it
without
distracting
it
finishes
with
some
dry
maltiness
and
a
ghost
of
its
hop
flavor
before
fading
into
a
lingering
mild
bitterness
refreshing
and
fulfilling
a
clean
exceptionally
wellbalanced
and
highly
drinkable
beer
very
nicely
done
and
well
worth
trying
f
this
beer
was
awesome
and
at
4
20
for
a
six
pack
how
could
i
not
buy
it
it
poured
a
thick
foggy
orangered
with
a
really
off
white
head
the
smell
was
very
fruity
and
reminded
me
of
peaches
which
was
very
pleasing
to
the
nose
the
taste
was
just
a
little
bitter
with
a
nice
mellow
malt
flavor
and
a
nice
citrus
undertone
i
really
like
this
beer
maine
is
a
lucky
state
overall
a
very
nice
red
ale
a
pleasure
to
drink
in
summer
or
winter
with
a
complex
and
well
balanced
flavor
a
little
more
aroma
and
it
would
be
almost
perfect
rich
looking
hazy
amber
with
a
tan
head
and
some
nice
decorative
lace
with
the
aroma
right
off
the
bat
this
brew
hints
at
the
malty
and
hoppy
goodness
to
come
those
flavors
are
in
perfect
balance
creating
an
incredibly
drinkable
ale
i
think
ill
keep
this
around
on
a
regular
basis
in
fact
i
went
back
to
the
store
and
bought
the
last
two
sixes
without
being
overly
complex
this
brew
revels
in
simplicity
and
that
makes
it
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
a
nice
find
and
a
keeper
this
flavorful
bold
red
ale
has
a
very
complex
character
the
bold
malt
aroma
drifts
from
the
glass
to
fill
the
air
the
initial
roasted
dark
malt
flavor
gives
way
to
a
light
hop
spice
and
a
sharp
lingering
bitterness
pretty
drinkable
quite
tasty

with
a
small

notes
absolutely

one

my
favourite

in

honestly
really
nothing
jumps

expect
the
fact
that
its
extremely
well
balanced
i
would
say
a
nice
even
balance
of
hops
and
malt
really
just
a
perfect
brew
for
session
drinking
such
a
great
take
on
what
is
traditionally
a
rather
boring
and
dull
style
i
cant
believe
im
tasting
strawberry
in
a
non
sugary
processed
adjunct
ale
its
naturally
sweet
and
delicious
overall
92
o
sessionable
for
sure
delicious
with
a
good
mix
of
earth
and
juicy
fruit
with
a
strong
malt
presence
smells
completely
different
than
how
it
tastes
89
o
this
was
a
decent
irish
red
ale
that
was
definitely
better
then
your
average
irish
red
however
there
wasnt
anything
that
really
made
this
beer
stand
out
there
was
a
nice
underlying
fruity
presence
and
a
nice
sweetness
but
the
beer
still
remained
a
little
bit
onedimensional
poured
this
22
ounce
bomber
into
a
weizen
glass
for
size
not
style
color
is
a
cloudy
deep
copper
with
an
inchdeep
ivory
head
wellstructured
but
not
persistent
citrus
hops
scream
on
the
nose
with
more
subtle
caramel
notes
hiding
beneath
more
hops
on
the
palate
but
of
the
piney
variety
and
more
than
a
little
tart
giving
way
gradually
to
undertones
of
toasted
malt
the
body
is
a
bit
flabby
with
little
carbonation
and
a
nondescript
finish
generally
enjoyable
and
refreshing
but
i
would
have
expected
a
bit
better
focus
from
this
brewery
o
as
previously
mentioned
this
is
how
fff
does
an
irish
red
and
its
awesome
fff
makes
a
lot
of
great
beers
and
this
one
is
near
the
top
for
me
fantastic
beer
that
hop
heads
and
malt
heads
can
all
enjoy
this
does
not
get
the
name
recognition
as
some
of
the
other
three
floyds
beers
do
but
it
is
definitely
a
solid
irish
ale

that
is

nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
irish
red
style
all
around
great
complexity
and
balance
of
malt
hop
and
ester
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
taste
starts
off
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
fades
into
a
sweeter
maltiness
that
i
would
expect
more
from
a
red
overall
i
love
me
some
fff
but
this
one
is
a
miss
i
do
not
really
get
what
the
goal
for
this
brew
was
flavor
seem
to
get
lost
and
are
overall
forgettable
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumlight
carbonation
intensity
leading
to
a
smooth
somewhat
crisp
slightly
foamy
beer
thats
easy
upon
the
palate
closes
fairly
dry
with
fairly
substantial
stickiness
remaining
across
the
palate
overall
its
a
shame
this
doesnt
come
in
6packs
i
normally
shy
away
from
irish
style
beers
but
this
is
great
theres
enough
bulk
to
this
beer
to
support
the
strength
and
depth
of
flavors
but
it
doesnt
drop
off
under
the
weight
it
actually
has
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
right
up
front
along
with
the
crispness
that
remains
strong
to
the
end
o
love
the
amarillo
hops
twist
on
the
irish
style
only
downside
may
be
it
seemed
a
bit
too
divided
from
the
carmelpineapple
vs
hops
there
seemed
almost
a
clear
division
and
wish
it
was
a
bit
thicker
and
frothier
that
said
all
great
flavors
dank
nose
was
really
nice
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
irish
style
beers
ive
had
three
floyds
continues
to
impress
onever
thought
id
have
an
irish
red
this
well
made
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
take
on
an
irish
red
ale
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
three
floyds
adds
their
signature
hop
twist
which
results
in
a
unique
and
perfectly
balanced
beer
i
loved
the
atypical
tropical
fruit
notes
in
the
aroma
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
very
true
to
style
and
pretty
tasty
its
a
really
nice
easy
drinker
i
honestly
couldnt
imagine
a
better
interpretation
of
an
irish
red
overalli
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
miss
for
three
floyds
or
it
could
be
that
their
other
brews
are
so
good
you
expect
that
from
them
every
single
time
their
is
quality
here
you
can
taste
it
in
the
hops
put
forward
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
3
5
b
very
interesting
beer
not
sure
if
it
is
supposed
to
highlight
the
hops
or
the
malts
but
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
an
easydrinking
irish
red
if
you
like
gumballhead
i
think
youll
like
this
too
since
its
a
seasonal
its
probably
just
a
onceayear
purchase
for
me
as
usual
another
stellar
beer
from
3
floyds
i
wanted
to
not
like
it
because
its
a
style
i
dont
care
for
but
this
is
really
good
and
goes
down
readily
the
alcohol
is
relatively
low
so
you
can
have
at
it
and
not
worry
about
jail
time
as
with
all
things
3f
a
hoppy
example
of
the
style
good
malt
character
though
to
carry
it
through
o
so
this
was
a
great
red
and
im
glad
i
chose
to
pick
it
up
most
reds
ive
had
punish
you
with
malt
but
this
had
a
great
balance
with
the
hops
without
it
being
a
hoppy
beer
three
floyds
always
brings
great
beers
and
this
is
not
different
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
why
the
hell
does
fff
almost
always
do
it
right
and
to
the
point
where
a
non
favorite
style
of
mine
becomes
a
win
in
my
books
once
again
they
just
continue
to
wow
me
and
this
one
too
has
wowed
me
initial
scent
of
cereal
grains
toasted
breads
and
a
dab
of
marmalade
spread
on
top
flavor
is
more
toffeecentered
but
still
has
toasted
bread
with
bitter
orange
peel
marmalade
used
as
balancing
material
against
the
malts
there
is
a
very
light
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
nuance
that
doesnt
really
appear
until
the
glass
warms
up
for
a
while
overall
very
well
done
overall
perhaps
it
is
a
personal
affinity
for
red
ales
but
this
beer
is
simply
wonderful
it
goes
down
so
smoothly
begs
you
to
continue
drinking
it
and
makes
you
lament
the
empty
bottle
sitting
in
front
of
you
as
the
last
drops
slide
down
your
throat
the
toffee
notes
really
make
this
beer
a
special
red
ale
it
does
not
quite
top
the
brilliance
of
tocobaga
but
if
that
beer
is
not
available
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
this
will
certainly
fill
the
void
as
the
differences
are
almost
negligible

overall
this
really
is
a
wonderful
beer
the
balance
is
really
as
close
to
perfect
as
i
think
you
can
get
this
is
my
first
beer
from
three
floyds
after
finally
tracking
some
down
in
ky
not
sure
when
ill
be
able
to
pick
up
some
more
but
i
am
very
anxious
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
i
picked
up
a
bomber
of
this
at
3
floyds
in
early
2012
for
8
pours
a
dark
copper
orange
with
a
fluffy
head
scent
is
hoppy
mixed
with
pineapple
delivering
a
thick
flavorful
taste
very
nicely
blended
ingredients
that
makes
for
a
great
sipping
beer
this
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
amber
with
two
fingers
of
head
the
aroma
has
a
fantastic
citrus
and
floral
hop
nose
theres
some
caramel
malts
in
there
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
big
burst
of
juicy
hops
at
first
this
is
followed
up
by
toasty
grains
and
caramel
malts
the
best
of
both
worlds
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
this
is
just
a
great
beer
i
could
see
this
being
a
favourite
at
the
bar
that
is
if
i
could
get
it
there
its
cut
from
the
same
cloth
as
beers
like
lagunitas
imperial
red
and
cigar
city
tocobaga
but
lighter
feeling
poured
into
a
standard
pint
and
enjoyed
over
good
conversation
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
standard
amber
in
color
with
two
fingers
width
of
clingy
white
head
smell
is
nice
and
hoppy
citrus
notes
and
sweet
toffee
taste
is
strongly
balanced
with
those
citrusy
hop
notes
presenting
them
selves
once
again
nice
mild
malt
toffee
and
caramel
with
just
a
hint
of
toasted
grain
really
well
done
this
beer
was
way
to
easy
to
enjoy
medium
body
with
a
slight
creamy
feel
lightly
carbonated
overall
im
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
one
3f
makes
some
awesome
beer
and
i
was
hoping
theyd
step
it
up
a
bit
when
it
comes
to
such
a
bland
style
but
they
went
the
traditional
route
its
not
bad
for
a
red
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
brewery
a
hoppedup
super
tasty
version
of
an
otherwise
pretty
lame
style
well
done
fff
o
man
i
really
do
enjoy
red
ales
with
a
bit
more
hops
this
one
is
really
tasty
i
rank
it
right
up
there
with
cigar
city
tocobaga
and
lagunitas
lucky
13
highly
recommended
totally
unexpected
for
this
style
but
the
toasted
caramelly
malt
grain
are
right
on
cue
taste
there
is
a
wondeful
light
hoppy
citricpineapple
character
that
jumps
right
out
in
the
flavor
before
the
expected
toasty
bread
elements
and
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
emerge
a
deeper
note
of
dark
roasted
coffee
appears
finally
a
delicious
washing
of
juicy
citrus
into
the
finish
which
is
dry
with
a
lingering
interplay
of
coffee
roast
bitterness
and
citric
juiciness
if
there
is
any
disappointment
its
the
body
which
seems
a
bit
on
the
light
side
to
me
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
twist
on
the
dry
malt
forward
irish
red
style
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
just
the
slightest
copper
hue
the
white
head
attenuates
very
quickly
to
a
thin
cap
and
then
to
nothing
but
a
few
bubbles
very
light
notes
of
amarillo
hops
in
the
nearly
absent
bouquet
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
with
a
thin
oily
moistness
that
would
make
nearly
anything
taste
better
clean
amarillo
comes
through
with
a
little
more
grain
depth
than
gumballhead
or
pride
and
joy
there
is
a
discernible
flavor
of
peat
in
this
beer
that
seems
to
define
its
overall
character
not
a
bad
effort
not
stellar
either
a
very
good
beer
but
somewhat
middle
of
the
road
for
3f
despite
some
interesting
and
unexpected
fruity
hop
character
this
is
still
an
easydrinking
pint
with
maltfocused
flavors
and
a
dry
roasty
finish
were
it
easy
to
obtain
in
the
sf
bay
area
id
put
this
near
the
top
of
my
list
for
go
to
examples
of
the
style
thanks
again
mike
for
including
this
in
the
box
feels
creamy
from
the
malt
then
gets
a
nice
shot
of
bitterness
to
cut
it
off
starts
off
sweet
then
ends
dry
pours
a
dark
murky
orangish
red
with
a
yellow
tinted
white
head
tons
of
it
with
tight
bubbles
leaving
a
thick
lace
the
nose
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
slightly
off
twang
to
it
the
grain
smells
stale
and
the
hops
oily
with
a
fleshy
orange
peel
the
taste
has
a
huge
toasted
malt
and
chocolate
malt
flavor
that
was
unexpected
the
hop
presence
is
much
lighter
than
in
the
nose
and
actually
more
balanced
lightly
citric
and
bitter
with
a
moderate
sweetness
crisp
finish
with
an
assertive
carbonation
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
that
had
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
to
it
the
beer
was
creamy
a
bit
sticky
and
finishes
with
a
nice
dry
balanced
taste
overall
high
quality
from
this
brewer
and
the
next
time
that
my
wife
is
in
indiana
i
will
have
her
pick
more
up
overall
im
impressed
once
again
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
red
ales
i
would
still
try
this
one
if
you
can
find
it
lighter
bodied
with
a
pleasant
creaminess
overall
3
floyds
did
it
again
a
real
fun
beer
not
sure
if
i
would
highly
desire
this
in
the
style
id
look
towards
a
meaty
more
malt
backbone
but
it
is
quite
unique
and
tastes
real
good
another
win
for
the
floyd
here
glad
to
have
tried
it
would
have
again
anytime
a
clear
golden
copper
color
with
a
solid
offwhite
fluff
and
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
offers
a
mild
citrus
hop
with
pineapple
and
caramel
with
a
bit
of
spicey
yeast
the
flavor
brings
a
unique
grassy
hop
bitterness
and
tropical
fruit
sweetness
once
again
i
get
plenty
of
caramel
with
definite
honey
this
is
medium
bodied
with
full
but
delicate
carbonation
feel
is
a
little
tinglyfizzy
with
a
slightly
glassy
component
the
hops
are
nicely
prominent
without
taking
away
from
the
style
grassy
and
a
bit
herbal
they
finish
with
a
bit
of
dryness
which
balance
off
the
sweet
clover
and
makes
for
a
pretty
unique
but
satisfying
and
drinkable
irish
red
a
solid
brew
for
sure
as
a
person
who
liked
hoppy
beers
i
like
the
smell
of
this
one
as
it
seems
a
bit
hoppy
for
a
red
which
works
for
me
a
very
drinkable
brew
quite
tasty
without
the
aftertaste
of
most
of
the
hoppy
brews
that
i
like
this
is
the
first
place
that
i
have
found
this
brew
but
if
you
can
find
it
i
highly
recommend
it
its
quite
balanced
and
drinkable
but
a
little
hard
to
get
in
these
parts
m
nice
and
creamy
with
the
hops
giving
the
beer
a
nice
bitter
leave
that
sticks
incredibly
well
the
hoppy
bitters
dry
the
tongue
mmmm
medium
bodied
nicely
carbonated
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
well
made
beer
and
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
a
beer
with
5
50
abv
is
packed
with
so
much
flavor
the
best
irish
red
ale
i
have
had
by
far
m
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
love
the
low
to
medium
carbonation
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
drink
easy
drinking
and
delicious
d
very
drinkable
excellent
red
ale
with
a
bit
more
hops
than
normal
for
the
style
the
balance
is
really
nice
and
the
beer
has
a
great
malty
profile
d
consensus
seems
to
be
that
this
is
brewed
very
much
outofstyle
but
those
fff
house
hop
notes
work
well
here
i
doubt
ill
revisit
again
but
worth
the
purchase
beer
pours
a
nice
reddishamber
hue
just
about
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
leave
a
marginal
head
that
vanishes
quickly
with
next
to
no
lacing
the
smell
on
this
leans
heavily
towards
the
malted
end
of
the
spectrum
i
like
to
smell
a
bit
more
hops
but
perhaps
my
expectations
for
the
style
are
off
there
are
some
nice
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
as
well
the
taste
is
strange
in
addition
to
the
malt
forward
character
of
this
beer
it
has
a
taste
as
though
its
heavy
in
alcohol
despite
being
only
5
5
abv
very
odd
the
mouthfeel
is
very
malty
in
a
way
that
sticks
around
and
coats
your
mouth
for
an
extended
period
of
time
theres
an
astringent
quality
to
this
that
im
not
too
keen
on
and
again
it
gives
off
a
feel
as
though
its
really
boozy
overall
this
is
average
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
fff
overall
three
floyds
did
an
amazing
job
with
this
brew
imo
the
balance
is
fabulous
and
the
complexity
is
awesome
for
this
style
of
beer
i
found
the
transitions
in
the
taste
to
be
spoton
and
it
makes
for
a
highly
drinkable
beer
this
is
an
exceptionally
easydrinking
nice
tasting
beer
very
sessionable
given
its
hop
profile
i
dont
know
if
this
is
necessarily
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
it
tastes
damn
good
o
interesting
contrast
between
the
hops
in
the
smell
and
the
relative
absence
of
them
in
the
flavor
the
aroma
is
its
best
characteristic
quite
extreme
o
a
hoppy
irish
red
with
a
restrained
malt
bill
in
the
three
floyds
style
o
this
brew
is
exactly
what
you
might
expect
an
irish
red
with
fffs
signature
delivered
by
an
added
level
of
hoppiness
a
very
enjoyable
brew
slainte
overall
nice
amber
here
with
some
interesting
flavours
going
on
o
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
good
flavor
nothing
extraordinary
but
good
nonetheless
one
to
have
on
st

festive
with
fun

and
some
overt
flavors
but
not
necessarily
interesting

exciting

good

very
good

have

bottom
line
picked
this
up
for
6
99
in
ohio
because
i
wanted
to
drink
an
irish
beer
on
spd
this
is
tasting
better
than
the
month
old
nugget
nectar
that
i
had
last
night
no
joke
a
style
i
had
started
to
move
away
from
but
three
floyds
really
hits
it
well
and
makes
it
one
of
the
best
o
this
is
a
very
good
irish
red
ale
i
am
sure
that
traditionally
speaking
this
is
overhopped
but
it
really
is
an
enjoyable
beer
for
me
a
big
thanks
to
billakowski
for
sending
this
one
out
my
way
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
redamber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
hoppier
than
i
expected
with
some
malt
aromas
coming
off
of
it
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
this
really
interesting
mustyaged
flavor
the
flavors
kept
me
guessing
on
what
it
was
that
i
was
tasting
the
other
flavors
were
of
caramel
and
some
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
was
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
its
a
good
brew
and
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
i
really
liked
this
one
a
really
tasty
hopforward
take
on
a
red
ale
smell
was
very
harsh
and
kinda
like
bo
taste
was
similar
very
harsh
bitterness
some
astringency
skunky
like
heineken
and
a
pleasant
aftertaste
was
not
left
no
sweetness
was
detected
i
am
not
kidding
about
this
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
body
odor
i
would
rather
drink
bud
light
than
this
o
surprisingly
hoppy
for
an
irish
red
but
that
is
no
shocker
coming
from
3fs
very
drinkable
as
usual
with
fff
the
style
is
hopped
more
aggressively
than
normal
which
is
how
i
like
my
reds
anyway
id
had
a
few
that
are
better
but
this
one
is
up
there
from
a
bomber
in
a
duvel
tulip
clear
amber
red
with
a
2
finger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
aroma
is
amarillo
hops
tropical
fruit
and
some
toffee
taste
is
of
caramel
toffee
orange
and
mild
grapefruit
this
red
has
somewhat
of
a
tropical
feel
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
the
flavor
lingers
awesome
irish
red
o
a
very
good
irish
red
some
might
argue
whether
it
should
be
considered
as
such
but
it
always
seems
that
3f
can
take
a
beer
style
and
add
an
interesting
twist
i
wish
it
wasnt
seasonal
but
it
does
make
for
a
good
spring
and
summer
beer
o
really
good
beer
the
sweet
and
bitter
qualities
of
the
taste
is
kind
of
unique
and
also
quite
delicious
also
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
o
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
really
loving
it
for
the
price
i
may
grab
a
few
more
bottles
cant
beat
it
o
certainly
not
a
traditional
irish
red
tastes
like
a
hopped
up
amber
ale
this
beer
actually
tastes
more
malty
at
first
but
further
along
this
really
tasted
more
hopped
up
especially
with
the
big
pineapple
aftertaste
mo
medium
body
with
great
carbonation
chewy
body
and
is
soft
of
the
palate
a
little
overhopped
for
the
style
imo
but
it
is
a
not
normal
3floyds
beer
so
that
is
to
be
expected
but
doesnt
detract
from
how
good
it
is
either
way
its
a
good
beer
and
easy
to
drink
3
5
d
this
is
more
like
alpha
king
than
an
actual
irish
red
ale
oh
well
its
tasty
but
i
was
expecting
an
irish
ale
so
im
a
bit
disappointed
o
this
beer
was
about
as
good
as
i
expected
it
to
be
and
more
weird
then
i
expected
but
i
never
really
know
what
to
expect
from
3f
its
not
physically
red
and
has
citrus
notes
that
embarrass
many
big
ipas
so
dont
expect
to
be
drinking
a
typical
red
here
this
beer
is
as
unique
as
they
come
and
really
defines
a
new
style
of
beer
draft
to
imperial
pint
looks
good
red
and
pretty
translucent
especially
for
a
fff
beer
probably
to
adhere
to
the
style
smells
good
too
like
a
hoppy
amber
conjures
up
an
image
of
a
lighter
nugget
nectar
tastes
good
but
much
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
irish
red
and
it
loses
12
point
because
of
this
even
though
the
taste
itself
doesnt
warrant
it
mouthfeel
is
good
too
overall
a
good
beer
that
is
miscategotized
do
a
delicious
highly
drinkable
enjoyable
repeatable
hoppy
treat
just
not
much
of
a
red
ale
o
a
ton
of
flavor
for
such
an
easydrinking
lowalcohol
beer
one
of
my
favorite
fff
monthly
offerings
so
far
cheers
overall
another
solid
offering
from
3floyds
i
am
going
to
have
to
hunt
for
another
bottle
or
stop
by
the
lizard
one
more
time
this
month
for
one
more
bottle
it
pours
a
light
bodied
pure
copper
in
color
with
a
nice
shine
and
good
clarity
it
reveals
only
a
slight
off
white
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
is
nice
and
fresh
it
gives
off
aromas
of
citrus
alongwith
pine
and
a
touch
of
onion
not
really
typical
for
the
style
the
flavors
are
very
light
and
crisp
it
features
light
pine
light
onion
and
fades
into
some
light
toffee
and
amber
malts
probably
as
complex
as
it
can
be
but
most
importantly
drinks
very
hoppy
for
the
style
its
light
and
drinks
pretty
light
in
body
its
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
irish
red
probably
the
best
around
very
nice
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again

a
hazy
brownish
orange
with

smell
is
hoppy
with
roasted

flavor
screams
of
caramel
and
maltyness
medium

with
underlying

tastes

tea
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
there
is
a
pleasant
balance
between
the

presence
and
the
toffeecaramel
flavor
o
ill
go
b
on
this
one
but
have
a
feeling
it
might
have
been
superb
if
it
was
fresh
i
love
that
fffs
uses
those
amarillo
hops
so
well
a
very
distinct
note
that
you
are
drinking
one
of
their
beers
bravo
o
overall
not
a
bad
irish
red
not
my
favorite
style
and
this
might
be
my
favorite
i
recommend
letting
it
warm
up
it
is
a
totally
different
beer
i
had
to
come
back
and
edit
my
scores
after
letting
it
sit
out
for
quite
a
while
overall
a
nice
irish
red
but
for
some
reason
seems
milder
in
flavor
to
me
than
i
may
have
anticipated
o
very
easy
drinking
had
no
problem
with
drinking
it
and
would
gladly
do
so
again
liked
that
this
was
a
hopped
up
irish
red
as
it
falls
more
in
line
with
my
natural
taste
another
solid
beer
from
fff
swee
toffee
hoppy
malt
scent
almost
like
a
hoppy
stout
deep
dark
thick
amber
color
very
nice
mouth
feel
clean
and
refreshing
watery
caramel
hops
with
a
touch
of
citrus
also
grapefruit
and
not
very
bitter
in
the
taste
or
finish
which
is
nice
easy
to
drink
and
not
as
complex
or
harsh
as
some
of
their
other
beers
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
them
a
very
nice
ale
o
for
me
the
hop
presence
is
a
big
improvement
on
a
traditional
amber
i
would
like
to
see
more
irish
red
ales
around
would
definitely
like
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
brian
boru
pours
a
very
attractive
reddish
copper
color
a
two
finger
head
recedes
gradually
leaving
nice
lacing
and
a
thin
white
coaster
the
nose
is
very
hoppy
smells
like
an
ipa
was
not
expecting
that
taste
is
hop
forward
at
the
start
with
some
nice
citrus
characteristics
hops
give
way
to
a
nice
malt
backbone
mid
palate
big
caramel
and
toffee
notes
are
present
hoppy
bitterness
returns
towards
the
end
and
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
viscosity
to
it
carbonation
is
medium
overall
brian
boru
is
a
tasty
very
drinkable
brew
from
three
floyds
i
certainly
appreciate
their
hoppy
take
on
the
style
and
would
gladly
have
this
again
if
given
the
chance
o
a
good
example
of
an
irish
red
enjoyed
o
red
velvet
cake
with
hops
truly
an
awesome
brew
however
im
not
sure
what
the
irish
would
think
of
it
overall
im
not
sure
that
i
would
call
this
an
irish
red
but
i
would
definitely
say
its
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
on
a
summer
day
the
hop
profile
was
very
refreshing
and
mighty
tasty
definitely
recommended
o
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
red
ale
great
combination
of
flavors
that
go
through
every
range
on
your
palate
it
keeps
drawing
you
back
for
more
and
boy
did
i
oblige
medium
mouthfeel
with
some
typical
hop
oil
texture
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
and
would
gladly
have
it
again
the
reveal
is
brian
boru
irish
red
big
want
of
mine
thanks
kyle
i
was
hoping
they
would
have
this
at
the
brewery
when
i
went
to
dld
last
month
but
they
didnt
so
very
glad
to
try
this
now
this
is
one
of
the
fff
beers
i
hadnt
had
before
tonight
but
i
really
enjoyed
the
nose
is
amazing
and
makes
this
one
of
the
better
irish
red
ales
ive
had
thanks
again
kyle
i
like
it
but
dont
love
it
i
do
like
what
i
detect
in
the
background
but
all
the
hops
drown
it
out
just
a
bit
that
said
its
three
floyds
that
distinctive
hoppy
flavor
is
part
of
what
makes
them
great
overall
brian
boru
is
a
good
session
beer
with
big
flavor
although
a
bit
unbalanced
d
brian
boru
is
a
flavorful
and
pleasing
beer
that
has
a
lower
abv
i
consider
it
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
monthly
three
floyds
bombers
22oz

a

taste
is
sweet

backbone
with
a
lightbright
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
an
oily

finish
is
bitter
but
very
pleasant
this
is
a
really
easytodrink
beer
because
of
its
bright
hops
there
is
so
much
flavor
in
this
beer
awesome
beer
o
a
fine
beer
to
be
drinking
for
st
pattys
and
beyond
d
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
representation
of
this
style
i
could
drink
2
or
3
bombers
of
this
during
a
nice
cookout
love
this
beer
will
get
again
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
from
beginning
to
end
i
will
drink
the
hell
out
of
it
should
i
see
it
again
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
creative
interpretations
of
the
irish
red
as
its
more
or
less
a
showcase
for
3
floyds
fondness
for
hops
especially
their
ace
in
the
hole
amarillo
i
categorize
this
somewhere
between
alpha
king
and
dreadnaught
its
like
a
beefedup
slightly
maltier
alpha
king
or
a
dreadnaught
thats
been
balanced
with
some
caramel
malts
and
had
the
hop
regimen
dialed
down
a
few
notches
not
so
irish
red
but
hey
its
delicious
cant
knock
it
too
much
for
that
overall
a
very
nice
take
on
the
normally
mundane
irish
red
ale
a
bit
out
of
the
norm
but
a
bit
better
than
the
vast
majority
of
the
beers
of
the
style
you
could
drink
a
boat
load
of
this
if
you
chose
to
slainte
pouge
mahone
o
good
seasonal
beer
wouldnt
be
my
bread
and
butter
but
come
st
paddys
day
reach
for
this
one
if
you
get
sick
of
the
guinness
and
harp
spend
some
time
to
learn
about
the
history
of
the
ard
ris
youll
appreciate
this
beers
name
sake
this
is
gumballheads
big
redheaded
brother
big
on
the
roasted
malt
and
well
balanced
with
3
floyds
heavy
hop
hands
smells
of
creme
brulee
with
citrus
essence
nice
average
head
this
is
how
one
should
celebrate
st
pattys
day
cant
wait
till
next
spring
o
finally
a
good
red
ale
that
has
flavor
typical
hop
characteristic
of
three
floyds
overall
this
brew
is
a
great
one
and
should
be
bottled
in
six
packs
and
sold
yearround
overall
this
is
a
solid
red
ale
but
doesnt
beat
out
my
favorite
the
panama
red
limited
this
guy
though
does
come
in
a
close
second
and
it
is
a
ridiculously
good
beer
to
drink
when
paired
with
a
nice
steak
note
this
got
an
a
but
it
could
have
easily
been
a
b
it
was
on
the
boarderline
between
b
and
a
for
me
d
yes
i
can
and
do
drink
this
when
given
the
opportunity
the
taste
profile
lends
itself
to
easy
drinking
and
the
abv
concludes
the
ease
of
drink
simply
put
three
floyds
has
made
a
nice
american
irish
red
d
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
can
get
a
bit
cloying
but
really
its
basically
perfect
thanks
to
funkyaudio
and
hurfer
for
the
bombers
just
in
time
for
st
pattys
week
poured
from
bomber
into
a
dimpled
mug
pours
a
clear
deep
ruby
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
beige
head
retains
very
nice
lacing
throughout
the
drinking
session
beautiful

up
piney

citrus
caramel

biscuit
buttered
toast
toffee
some
pineapple
and
resin
flavor
of
piney
hops
honey
resin
grapefruit
and
orange
citrus
toast
herbal
notes
and
definitely
a
nice
share
of
caramel
malts
lightmedium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
throughout
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
in
a
very
good
way
crisp
refreshing
and
extremely
wellbalanced
for
the
style
perfect
amount
of
hops
and
bitterness
this
brew
has
become
my
favorite
for
the
irish
red
ale
style
im
actually
surprised
to
see
this
at
under
6
abv
so
its
definitely
sessionable
imagine
that
doesnt
suck
at
all
nice
malt
profile
and
creamy
mouthfeel
of
pale
ale
without
same
level
of
bitternesss
a
bit
sweet
but
not
too
much
with
a
slighly
astringent
finish
where
you
notice
the
alcohol
but
not
too
much
also
leaves
a
tannin
taste
similar
to
tea
which
might
keep
me
from
drinking
more
than
a
couple
but
nonetheless
a
very
solid
beer
extremely
sessionable
not
too
high
abv
but
full
of
flavor
readily
available
by
me
however
i
probably
only
have
6
weeks
to
get
as
much
as
i
can
d
good
drinking
not
too
heavy
but
a
funny
aftertaste
slows
me
down
a
bit
this
beer
is
part
of
my
1
beer
per
style
project
best
irish
red
ale
currently
on
beeradvocate
com
and
i
agree
dvery
drinkable

just
a
great
profile
solid
drinkability
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
would
like
but
really
very
nice
i
suppose
its
fairly
drinkable
but
after
so
many
top
notch
brews
from
3fs
this
is
a
disappointment
and
as
far
as
value
its
not
a
chug
of
this
will
set
you
back
the
same
as
a
6
pack
of
a
comparably
good
red
from
a
brewery
as
far
away
as
the
west
coast
and
3fs
is
local
figure
that
one
out
its
not
as
if
their
ingredients
are
triple
the
price
hopefully
we
see
more
classics
coming
out
from
3fs
in
the
future
sorry
guys
but
brian
boru
seems
like
a
halfeffort
drinkability
very
pleasant
brian
boru
is
a
nice
change
from
the
typical
hoppy
fff
beer
the
honey
malt
sweetness
and
tropical
fruit
notes
are
brushed
aside
leaving
a
dry
resinous
irish
red
slainte
overall
quite
drinkable
a
very
hoppy
take
on
the
style
that
impresses
me
three
floyds
motto
is
its
not
normal
and
this
beer
certainly
fits
in
that
line
of
thinking
sometimes
very

it

an
interesting
beer

love
reds

this
is
a

example
although
the
balance
does
seem
to
lean
very
heavily
towards
the

a

underlying
malt
aroma
taste
is
very
malty
and
much
less
hoppy
than
i
would
have
expected
from
a
beer
by
three
floyds
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
dry
crisp
finish
this
brew
is
definitely
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
above
average
personally
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
its
good
nonetheless
i
just
expected
a
little
more
hop
flavor
than
the
beer
provided
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pour
is
a
deep
red
amber
with
a
tiny
tan
head
light
lacing
aroma
is
that
familiar
fff
hop
profile
with
notes
of
caramel
and
grapefruit
flavor
is
a
big
citrusy
caramel
followed
by
a
mellow
hint
of
hop
and
pine
very
mellow
and
well
balanced
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
smooth
with
a
quick
bitter
kick
at
the
finish
a
real
winner
its
called
irish
red
style
by
3
floyds
but
this
is
really
an
exceptional
amber
american
ale
pours
a
cloudy
redbrown
rusty
looking
thick
tan
head
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
nice

grapefruit
super
malty
with
3f
hop
twist
lots
of
pine
pineapple
more

nice

taste
is
very
malty
as
well
thick

and
a

some

very
rich

with

tons
of

i
really
liked
d
i
think
it
is
really
good
nice
balance
of
all
the
flavors
and
the
best
irish
red
i
have
had
d
a
well
crafted
red
ale
complex
for
the
style
and
the
selection
of
hops
gives
this
beer
a
different
angle
recommended
split
a
22
oz

of
this
with
a
good

a
very
slightly
hazy

into
a
rich
grainy

then
ends
with
a
piny

medium

highly
drinkable
beer
overall
a
fine

fermented
by
a

with

dry
slightly
fruity

i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
the
legend
on
the
bottle
immensely
the
guys
at
3
floyds
are
giving
all
of
us
from
munster
something
to
be
proud
of
on

poured

a
deep
bronze
with
a
thinner
but
well
sustained
slight
off

aromas
of
sweet

made
it
very
appetizing
a
big
lightly
sweet

really
showed
itself
along
with
a
hint
of

melding
into
a

notes
of
of

solid

somewaht
complex
red

a
good
combination
of

winner
from
fff
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
three
floyds
does
some
amazing
things
with
hops
the
get
big
juicy
fruit
flavor
from
hops
that
i
havent
expierenced
from
other
breweries
another
winner
from
them
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
be
able
to
buy
by
the
6pack
deep
ruby
body
topped
by
a
bright
creamy
head
head
retention
is
good
as
is
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
fruit
and
herbal
hops
flavor
has
some
malt
initially
but
a
strong
woodiness
enters
which
is
then
followed
by
an
ashy
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
soapy
hop
note
continues
to
build
as
i
consume
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
thin
enough
to
get
out
of
the
way
but
enough
to
savor
drinkability
is
much
better
than
it
should
be
i
think
the
hoppiness
makes
you
thirsty
so
you
keep
drinking
more
of
it
whatever
the
reason
i
drank
this
one
quickly
even
though
i
didnt
completely
enjoy
it
thin
feeling
with
a
little
residual
hop
oiliness
although
it
does
have
more
moxy
than
any
other
irish
red
ive
tried
very
drinkable
and
if
i
were
with
a
killians
drinker
i
feel
like
i
could
convert
them
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
in
a
split
second
with
this
brew
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
one
tastes
a
little
watery
and
leaves
almost
an
oily
aftertaste
its
okay
i
honestly
feel
its
a
little
subpar
for
three
floyds
but
maybe
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
overall
its
okay
a
far
cry
from
some
of
the
other
classics
we
love
from
this
brewery
i
dont
usually
pay
7
99
per
bottle
of
beer
for
something
to
take
home
after
work
but
this
beer
had
been
intriguing
me
for
some
time
and
i
bit
the
bullet
it
poured
very
dark
for
a
red
and
had
a
robust
scent
with
a
hearty
head
that
lasted
well
into
the
drinking
the
drinking
was
the
highlight
i
am
not
a
fan
of
reds
as
a
rule
but
this
has
body
and
flavor
with
a
hoppy
feel
i
dont
see
this
being
a
consistent
purchase
but
it
was
quite
good
money
spent
aside
d
surprisingly
vivid
hop
flavors
for
such
low
ibus
low
abv
coupled
with
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
make
for
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
all
day
drinkability
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
as
with
gumballhead
the
floyds
have
taken
an
often
insipid
style
and
turned
it
on
its
head
oelergud
like
every
three
floyds
beer
ive
had
so
far
amazing
d
amazingly
drinkable
great
session
beer
i
could
have
easily
had
a
few
more
but
i
had
to
save
room
for
the
dreadnaught
and
the
black
sun
man
i
love
three
floyds
drinkability
great
i
could
really
drink
a
lot
of
this
beer
it
is
very
well
balanced
has
a
great
interesting
aroma
and
a
nice
appearance
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
this
beer
couldve
been
much
better
this
is
a
disappointing
effort
considering
three
floyds
lofty
standards
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
copperred
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
smells
like
citrus
hops
grapefruit
some
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
it
tastes
more
like
floral
hops
than
citrus
hops
but
i
can
taste
both
along
with
some
sweet
malt
as
well
theres
a
pretty
good
balance
with
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
a
bit
watery
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
smooth
not
my
favorite
of
the
fff
beers
but
its
still
better
than
most
pours
a
deep
red
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
sweet
hops
and
some
malts
taste
starts
out
malty
then
the
hops
come
in
and
theres
a
nice
piney
finish
its
like
hops
grown
in
a
coniferous
forest
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
averageish
its
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
i
enjoyed
the
bottle
but
wont
be
sneaking
it
out
again
goodsized
head
and
a
beautiful
deepred
color
great
hoppy
pineapple
malt
aroma
tasty
with
malt
and
citrus
hop
flavors
accompanied
by
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavor
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
you
can
certainly
enjoy
a
lot
of
at
only
5
9
abv
this
remains
one
of
my
favorite
3fs
beers
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
makes
it
easily
drinkable
the
style
guidleline
predicted
a
teaish
hoppiness
the
only
way
i
can
see
that
is
in
the
near
lack
of
bitterness
at
least
relative
to
the
other
hop
characteristics
while
i
had
tried
this
beer
at
a
beer
tasting
it
seemed
a
bit
different
when
having
the
bottle
for
starters
it
is
a
good
beer
but
just
a
bit
too
heavy
for
an
irish
red
it
borders
scotch
ale
in
my
opinion
great
color
fantastic
smell
but
all
in
all
a
bit
too
heavy
to
be
a
nice
session
irish
red
however
i
read
a
review
that
compares
it
a
heavier
red
seal
and
i
totall
agree
has
that
red
seal
taste
it
is
a
hoppymalty
mix
its
ok
but
i
would
not
drop
7
a
bomber
again
for
it
this
beer
is
good
but
obviously
better
when
fresh
thanks
much
to
shbobdb
for
this
fine
beer
m
d
watery
for
a
red
but
easy
to
drink
prefer
it
thicker
but
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
would
need
to
wash
it
down
with
something
as
it
leaves
my
throat
tight
id
buy
this
again
but
not
at
that
price
point
cheers
the
mouth
is
light
on
the
front
smooth
and
bittersweet
on
the
finish
as
the
hops
and
sugar
both
assert
themselves
leaving
a
sticky
residue
upon
the
lips
a
little
sugary
on
the
back
to
be
highly
drinkable
has
a
solid
overall
balanced
but
seems
slighly
off
balance
not
one
of
the
best
from
fff
drinkable
when
available
a
bomber
might
be
a
perfect
single
serving
size
but
i
shared
mine
with
a
fellow
homebrewer
poured
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
tan
head
that
disappeared
almost
as
fast
as
it
developed
quite
disappointing
smell
was
awesome
pineapple
and
resiny
hops
greet
you
probably
not
very
true
to
style
but
its
smells
so
good
taste
reminds
me
of
red
koolaid
for
some
reason
piney
hops
kick
in
to
help
out
and
a
slightly
roasted
finish
i
just
didnt
care
for
the
koolaid
taste
maybe
im
missing
something
lower
carbonation
and
light
to
medium
bodied
it
was
a
decent
beer
and
loved
the
smell
but
i
cant
say
id
search
this
out
this
is
the
first
fffs
that
i
didnt
find
to
be
awesome
but
then
again
maybe
im
missing
something
ill
probably
try
it
again
to
double
check
the
fruitiness
was
different
for
the
style
but
quite
enjoyable
tasty
brew
drinkable
similar
to
red
seal
amber
on
a
good
day
though
red
seal
has
more
pnw
type
hops
and
this
was
a
bit
more
earthy
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
but
just
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
hops
for
the
style
i
realize
that
3f
doesnt
really
adhere
to
many
style
guidelines
which
i
generally
love
but
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
a
straightup
irish
red
and
this
beer
just
didnt
quite
scratch
my
itch
unique
version
of
the
style
and
recommended
a
very
strong
irish
red
ale
with
a
caramel
and
fruity
base
and
a
robust
for
the
style
hop
presenceperfect
for
my
personal
prefernces
im
not
a
hop
head
per
se
though
i
like
the
occasional
dipa
but
a
stronger
than
average
hop
presence
to
balance
a
strong
malty
base
is
my
idea
of
a
red
ale
and
three
floyds
does
a
great
job
with
this
one
the
aroma
is
light
and
doesnt
pull
up
into
the
nose
well
and
the
head
was
weak
and
the
rust
color
became
a
barely
noticable
blob
in
the
center
of
the
very
very
redrubyred
beer
if
in
a
well
lit
bar
or
a
sunny
patio
the
red
color
from
a
distance
could
be
mistaken
for
a
summer
fruity
beer
the
the
slightly
creamy
but
full
body
mouthfeel
would
tell
the
difference
for
you
immediately
give
this
one
a
shot
if
you
can
get
it
had
this
as
an
after
dinner
relaxer
nice
red
color
very
much
like
it
should
be
with
a
dominate
white
head
that
fades
slowly
smell
is
of
caramelized
malt
with
a
strong
arm
of
hops
grapefruit
with
spice
the
taste
enthralls
the
palate
holding
it
before
passing
on
and
giving
you
a
dry
finish
very
much
a
irish
red
but
strengthed
and
grown
a
mustache
good
body
and
a
bomber
will
do
you
fine
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
although
the
carbonation
is
just
about
right
a
beer
with
this
much
character
should
be
thick
in
the
mouth
mild
pine
hop
profile
coupled
with
a
slightly
biscuity
malt
character
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
but
overall
this
is
simply
an
adequate
beer
with
nothing
exceptional
22
oz
bomber
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
a
dark
garnet
that
is
clear
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
half
inch
tan
head
and
the
second
pour
contributes
some
sediment
grapefruit
and
pineapple
hops
in
the
aroma
with
additional
notes
of
leafy
hops
faint
tea
and
caramel
there
is
mango
and
pineapple
on
the
palate
with
a
light
to
medium
bitterness
and
a
firm
toasted
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
tea
it
has
a
medium
body
that
is
somewhat
dry
and
near
the
end
of
the
first
pour
its
a
bit
watery
but
the
second
pour
cures
that
overall
a
good
quite
drinkable
irish
red
that
really
brings
out
the
hop
flavor
without
getting
all
the
bitterness
i
just
wish
it
like
a
lot
of
3f
offerings
were
a
bit
cheaper
a
solid
drinkin
brew
its
cleanness
is
respectful
to
its
balance
as
it
has
a
wonderfully
crafted
oily
tone
to
it
that
makes
for
solid
enjoyment
drinkability
a
nice
pleasant
brew
good
for
all
occasions
poured
a
22oz
bomber
appearance
was
a
clear
copper
color
with
a
medium
size
head
aroma
was
maltysweet
with
molasses
coming
to
mind
a
faint
whiff
of
grass
also
came
through
taste
was
primarily
sweet
molasses
again
blackstrap
in
particular
with
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
at
the
end
the
flavor
was
very
well
balanced
body
was
medium
and
carbonation
was
quite
low
leading
to
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
very
smooth
however
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
but
to
me
quite
filling
awesome
looking
brew
pours
a
very
brilliant
amber
redish
color
very
clear
a
nice
one
inch
thick
cream
colored
head
forms
fades
a
little
slowly
leaving
a
ton
of
delicate
lacing
citrusy
hops
dominate
the
smell
as
with
most
three
floyds
brews
there
is
a
musty
dusty
malt
smell
in
the
background
very
well
balanced
flavor
of
citrusy
hops
and
caramel
malts
a
tad
sweet
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
great
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
not
filling
at
all
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
another
great
beer
from
three
floyds
drinkability
pretty
good
seems
to
improve
a
bit
as
approaches
room
temperature
drinkability
the
ales
strong
hop
character
does
not
impair
the
drinkability
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
malts
but
overall
i
have
little
to
complain
about
the
color
was
burnt
pumpkin
with
a
creamy
head
the
aroma
was
mostly
hops
over
a
slightly
caramel
background
the
flavor
was
a
little
roasty
a
littel
caramel
and
definite
hops
i
put
the
mouthfeel
at
a
3
5
because
the
body
seemed
a
little
thin
but
id
still
get
it
again
drinkability
yeah
this
is
extremely
delicious
insanely
complex
and
well
very
expensive
at
least
as
far
as
im
concerned
do
you
get
what
you
pay
for
in
this
instance
though
yes
would
i
buy
another
one
yes
a
fantastic
brew
all
around
aroma
is
caramel
and
grassy
and
herbal
hops
overall
the
nose
is
fairly
mild
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
gentle
rolling
carbonation
flavor
starts
with
some
chocolate
and
caramel
thenn
rolls
to
some
lite
grassy
hops
that
linger
and
come
back
with
each
burp
the
beer
is
smooth
an
very
drinkable
not
overly
complex
or
robust
but
a
solid
example
of
the
style
imo
worth
a
shot
i
would
like
a
fresh
bottle
this
showed
signs
of
aging
or
mistreatment
d
three
floyds
is
interesting
they
make
some
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
but
wow
are
some
of
their
beers
mediocre
not
that
ambers
are
usually
a
stand
out
style
but
i
suppose
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
bottle
poured
a
deep
clear
amber
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
citrus
hops
is
clearly
dominant
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
sweet
malt
caramel
and
some
overpowering
hops
seems
to
me
this
another
one
of
those
3f
recipe
where
they
take
a
traditional
style
pride
joy
robert
the
bruce
and
drop
some
major
hops

make

almost
slammable
cheers
this
is
one
very
easy
to
drink
beer
the
beer
that
proves
that
irish
ale
isnt
just
a
marketing
gimmick
to
sell
killians
red
tasty
ale
that
will
appeal
to
a
regular
beer
drinker
with
lots
of
extra
flavor
that
a
real
beer
fan
can
love
drinkability
is
really
good
this
would
be
a
great
brew
to
enjoy
on
tap
yet
another
great
beer
from
the
folks
at
three
floyds
a
little
to
hoppy
to
be
a
red
in
my
book
but
still
a
very
nice
beer
i
think
i
can
say
this
is
undoubtably
the
best
irish
red
ive
had
to
date
my
lord
ill
be
burping
up
hops
for
the
rest
of
the
night
three
floyds
you
continue
to
amaze
d
a
hoppy
take
on
the
irish
red
style
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
from
3f
but
still
a
tasty
beer
a
nice
copperbrown
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
laces
nicely
the
aroma
is
very
surprising
i
was
expecting
the
malt
to
be
the
dominant
aroma
it
is
there
but
the
distinct
aroma
of
hop
spiciness
and
earthy
scents
are
very
apparent
the
taste
the
malt
is
very
strong
then
i
am
left
with
a
question
what
happen
to
the
hops
the
hops
seem
to
diminish
in
the
taste
they
do
bring
some
flavor
at
the
end
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
the
only
characteristic
that
the
hops
leave
behind
is
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
though
the
aroma
could
scare
some
off
the
taste
would
be
enjoyable
to
some
drinkability

this
one
started
off
looking
and
smelling
good
but
in
the
end
disappointed
on
tap
track
84
in
warwick
r
i
poured
clear
almond
amber
with
a
standard
tan
head
and
leaving
minimal
to
minor
lacing
bland
malty
nose
this
a
pretty
tame
malty
red
ale
notes
of
vanilla
and
honey
picked
up
amoungst
the
decent
malty
crest
of
this
brew
very
minor
hop
character
looks
like
this
beer
in
bottles
is
quite
hoppy
interesting
cuz
the
tap
version
pint
that
had
was
malt
and
more
malt
nothing
special
but
a
decent
sessioner
if
your
thing
is
middle
of
the
road
malty
brew
pours
a
deep
brownish
garnet
in
color
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
piney
aroma
with
a
caramel
malt
underlying
to
it
soft
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
three
floyds
hops
the
shit
out
of
everything
and
this
is
no
exception
with
an
open
mind
this
is
no
doubt
their
take
on
an
irish
red
albeit
untraditional
piney
hoppiness
dominates
the
flavor
of
this
beer
underneath
all
the
hop
bitterness
lies
a
caramel
and
toasted
malt
flavor
gets
a
touch
seltzery
definitely
unique
for
the
style
but
off
the
mark
if
you
ask
me
hop
heads
will
probably
enjoy
this
quite
a
bit
but
i
dont
feel
this
is
inline
for
an
irish
red
i
love
the
label
illustration
though
this
is
really
a
terrific
offering
from
three
floyds
while
it
is
not
spectacularly
complex
what
irish
red
is
it
is
very
flavorful
and
stays
true
to
the
style
by
being
very
drinkable
despite
the
copious
amount
hops
that
is
typical
of
fff
the
smell
is
off
the
hook
piney
hops
that
just
are
incredibly
inviting
the
taste
is
more
subdued
with
a
mellow
citrusy
hoppiness
that
just
begs
for
another
sip
i
would
buy
this
beer
constantly
if
it
were
available
in
mass
and
were
less
than
7
a
bomber
overall
this
is
just
an
enjoyable
brew
that
i
could
find
myself
using
as
a
session
brew
if
it
wasnt
as
pricey
as
it
is
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
anywhere
drinkability
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
a
big
hoppy
irish
red
who
would
have
thought
3
floyds
again
shows
why
they
are
one
of
the
better
craft
brewers
plenty
of
hops
to
satisfy
most
hop
heads
but
also
very
well
balanced
a
great
session
beer
especially
at
5
9
abv
not
true
to
style
but
who
cares
a
damn
good
beer
all
around
seek
this
one
out
and
enjoy
that
actually
sums
up
my
experience
with
this
beer
overall
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
got
smoother
with
every
sip
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
get
it
again
sorry
floyds
poured
an
intense
dark
copperrust
color
with
a
frothy
head
that
just
sat
there
for
a
few
minutes
leaving
behind
plenty
of
lacing
full
of
carbonation
with
tiny
bubbles
speeding
to
the
surface
to
join
the
party
aromas
of
grapefruit
pine
grass
roasted
malt
and
rubber
exciting
and
a
bit
unusual
the
taste
followed
the
scent
with
a
malty
core
that
was
surrounded
by
juicy
citrus
hops
fruity
and
earthy
sweetness
gives
way
to
bold
and
potent
hops
that
linger
in
the
finish
generating
a
bitter
taste
good
mouthfeel
just
a
tad
slick
with
the
taste
and
aromas
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
again
and
again
without
a
problem
drinkability
notes

its
a
fine
beer
i
just
wish
that
three
floyds
didnt
have
to
pile
hops
into
every
beer
they
make
this
is
a
lot
like
a
sweeter
maltier
version
of
alpha
king
id
take
conways
irish
ale
over
this
if
i
was
looking
for
something
a
bit
truer
to
style
but
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
if
you
look
at
it
for
what
it
is
i
will
drink
this
again
for
sure
a
clean
copperred
beer
with
deep
ruby
highlights
has
a
big
bubbly
beige
haed
with
a
tinge
of
red
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
starts
with
a
strong
duo
of
floral
and
citrusy
hops
with
a
hint
of
carmel
malt
in
the
background
the
caramel
malt
lands
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
as
the
floral
and
citrusy
hops
character
rushes
by
the
sides
there
is
a
dry
finish
with
a
tea
like
note
at
the
end
this
strikes
me
as
elements
of
multiple
styles
melded
to
produce
a
very
pleasing
mesh
of
tasteful
compatibility
its
got
a
credible
warm
abv
but
its
very
crisp
clean
and
drinkable
in
spite
of
its
apparent
size
it
goes
to
show
that
in
the
hands
of
a
master
a
diverse
many
can
be
wedded
into
a
damned
good
one
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
this
is
a
red
ale
that
any
hop
head
would
love
nicely
done
this
is
just
outstanding
on
tap
way
better
than
i
remember
it
being
in
the
bottle
wow
brian
boru
blends
biting
pine
and
orange
zest
hop
flavors
with
robust
caramel
and
brown
sugar
malts
its
full
of
body
and
spunk
it
looks
good
with
a
red
amber
body
and
thick
tan
cream
head
the
malts
and
hops
are
balanced
beautifully
in
the
aromas
of
mandarin
pineapple
toffee
and
caramel
carbonation
is
minimal
mf
is
creamy
initially
becomes
dry
and
biting
halfway
through
and
then
goes
back
to
the
malts
i
cant
say
that
it
really
fits
the
style
but
it
obviously
isnt
meant
too
its
a
great
beer
that
just
happens
to
cost
way
too
much
in
the
bottle
these
days
all
the
more
reason
to
seek
it
out
on
tap
i
am
not
typically
an
irish
red
ale
fan
but
i
have
great
faith
in
three
floyds
so
i
gave
it
a
shot
deep
satisfying
red
color
the
overly
maltysweet
quality
that
drives
me
away
from
irish
reds
was
not
there
it
had
a
grapefruitesque
smell
similar
to
what
you
find
in
alpha
king
the
front
end
had
a
surprisingly
crisp
citrus
hop
quality
with
nice
subtle
malty
undertones
clean
mouthfeel
i
will
definately
drink
this
again
if
i
encounter
it
on
tap
this
was
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
it
produced
a
12
inch
head
that
subsided
into
just
surface
skim
and
left
decent
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
ale
was
deep
reddish
brown
like
tea
powerfull
and
pleasant
citrus
aroma
citrus
grapefuit
some
pine
pretty
much
all
hops
no
hint
of
malt
taste
was
similar
grapefuit
and
orange
hop
dominating
this
ale
doughy
pleasant
bready
malt
hanging
way
in
the
back
quietly
providing
backbone
not
at
all
sweet
and
without
any
roasted
acridness
there
was
even
a
slight
aftertaste
of
tea
and
all
the
time
grapefruit
oranges
lemon
hops
and
hops
and
very
dry
hey
this
is
really
an
ipa
in
disguise
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
full
very
satisfying
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
this
goes
down
easy
this
is
an
excellent
ale
and
i
will
certainly
enjoy
it
from
time
to
time
i
had
been
waiting
to
try
this
beer
for
some
time
and
it
was
certainly
worth
the
wait
i
know
i
said
the
same
thing
about
the
dreadnaught
but
its
so
true
especially
since
i
know
i
wont
be
disappointed
by
three
floyds
on
tap
at
track
84
in
warwick
ri
this
beer
pours
reddish
brown
with
an
unholy
darkness
to
an
irish
red
ale
that
was
truly
awesome
the
smell
is
classic
floyds
in
that
it
had
a
fresh
flowered
hoppiness
to
it
not
found
in
any
other
irish
red
ales
the
hoppiness
transfers
over
in
the
taste
as
well
mixing
with
orange
and
herbs
on
the
tremendously
long
finish
the
mouthfell
was
just
right
not
too
heavy
or
too
thin
but
perfectly
balanced
i
ended
up
having
4
or
5
throughout
the
evening
and
at
5
9
alc
which
suprised
me
when
i
found
out
it
was
easy
to
drive
the
hour
and
a
half
home
its
a
shame
this
beer
isnt
around
longer
but
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
slainte
the
color
of
this
beer
is
a
rich
amber
slightly
hazy
and
topped
by
a
thick
tan
head
that
shows
nice
retention
i
love
the
aroma
of
3
floyds
beers
see
my
comments
on
the
black
sun
stout
this
beer
has
even
more
rich
hop
aroma
the
same
floral
character
i
get
in
many
of
their
beers
but
with
a
more
intense
citrusorange
character
in
this
offering
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
bright
edge
of
citrus
grapefruit
that
hits
you
immediately
malty
finish
of
caramel
and
toffee
slick
mouth
feel
not
particularly
full
good
drinkability
no
alcohol
feel
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
of
this
style
but
not
a
favorite
3
floyds
still
very
nice
d
very
nice
on
all
accounts
a
nice
interesting
flavor
and
one
you
could
sit
with
for
a
long
time
drinkability
is
good
on
another
tasty
winner
from
the
floyds
mouthfeel
great
carbonation
and
being
just
shy
of
6
abv
a
great
session
beer
the
balance
of
hops
and
malts
makes
this
beer
so
very
appealing
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
easy
to
quaff
this
brew
several
pints
can
be
consumed
in
a
session
worth
a
look
drinkability
could
be
better
very
dry
and
bitter
not
exactly
one
of
the
most
refreshing
irish
reds
ive
had
but
leave
it
to
3fs
to
give
you
a
kick
in
the
ass
with
their
spin
on
a
seemingly
ordinary
style
good
stuff
but
i
dont
know
if
i
will
revisit
it
once
again
tied
with
dark
lord
for
the
most
badass
label
ever
rich
dark
amber
color
yet
perfectly
clear
and
a
very
nice
off
white
head
the
smell
is
mainly
hops
not
overly
malty
this
is
odd
it
says
on
the
bottle
there
are
pineapple
aromas
and
i
can
actualy
detect
a
hint
of
it
in
the
citrus
aftertaste
other
than
that
which
in
truth
is
a
fairly
minor
note
this
is
pretty
hoppy
for
a
red
but
well
balanced
with
the
complex
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
slighly
sticky
but
again
well
balanced
overall
this
is
easily
the
most
enjoyable
red
ive
had
i
dont
usualy
go
for
red
ales
but
i
am
a
pretty
big
fan
of
the
three
floyds
brews
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
redefines
the
style
drinkability
is
good
this
seems
to
be
a
more
interesting
version
of
the
style
but
i
can
totally
dig
it
hops
are
nicely
over
expressed
clear
reddish
brown
with
almost
no
head
piney
and
grassy
hops
in
the
aroma
some
nice
sweetness
too
caramel
and
vanilla
mostly
caramel
and
brown
sugar
make
this
sweet
with
a
lingering
bitterness
balancing
the
flavor
some
slightly
citrusy
notes
that
came
out
a
little
more
as
it
warmed
thin
to
medium
bodied
this
would
make
a
pretty
nice
session
beer
1st
of
5
beers
tried
at
our
first
meeting
of
the
south
bend
coalition
of
the
drinking
good
looking
bottle
and
i
anticipated
the
beer
greatly
since
id
just
been
up
to
3
floyds
this
past
weekend
pours
out
nicely
some
carbonation
reddish
brown
color
some
lacing
odor
is
biscuity
with
some
hoppiness
not
much
hop
taste
more
like
caramel
and
biscuits
grapefruit
weak
bitter
chocolate
undertones
bitter
aftertaste
not
best
tasting
red
ive
had
but
fairly
good
damn
good
drinkability
though
gimme
another
in
conclusion
while
the
popular
smithwicks
is
certainly
no
slouch
of
an
irish
red
ale
it
just
doesnt
have
the
complexity
or
the
spirit
to
compete
with
the
fff
gang
tasty
and
not
as
challenging
as
some
of
the
other
3fs
offerings
i
like
this
and
when
reasonably
priced
it
is
worth
picking
up
it
has
a
nice
little
mix
of
everything
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
is
just
a
fantastic
effort
maybe
the
most
friendly
bomber
presentation
for
cross
over
drinking
just
a
fantastic
meduim
bodied
beer
with
a
proper
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
slides
right
down
the
throat
drinkability
about
as
irish
as
a
st
patricks
day
parade
but
im
not
complaining
too
much
midwest
represent
a
nice
hoppy
red
ale
with
some
chutzpah
beer
is
good
happy
beering
great
overall
beer
i
wanted
brian
boru
old
irish
red
to
be
bigger
more
resiny
and
more
unrelentingly
hoppy
but
ive
made
my
peace
with
what
it
is
rather
than
what
i
wish
it
was
the
bottom
line
is
that
its
another
fantastic
effort
from
those
hopobsessed
hoosiers
this
is
borutiful
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
yet
somewhat
syrupy
from
the
hops
most
likely
the
carbonation
is
midlevel
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
due
to
the
low
abv
and
clean
finish
other
than
the
hoppiness
which
seems
to
increase
as
the
beer
warms
this
might
be
a
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
the
nonbeliever
but
not
really
drinkable
forme
the
blend
of
flavors
is
just
a
bit
overpowering
it
seems
like
an
interesting
experiment
and
a
wellmade
beer
but
the
particular
hops
used
and
quantities
thereof
dont
allow
me
to
fully
appreciate
it
not
even
enough
for
me
to
order
a
second
one
slàinte
this
is
a
very
good
beer
pours
deep
clear
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
patches
of
lace
has
a
lovely
aroma
thats
full
of
juicy
floral
and
piney
hops
flavor
begins
sweet
and
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
then
finishes
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
is
spicy
and
satisfying
the
beer
has
low
carbonation
and
is
quite
light
not
one
of
the
most
in
your
face
beers
the
floyds
have
put
out
but
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
thanks
go
out
to
the
ard
ri
of
reviews
cokes
drinkability
seems
like
the
in
thig
to
do
is
to
make
a
red
ale
taste
like
an
ipa
oh
well
it
was
pretty
good
whatever
it
is

not

rather
hoppy

estery
honey

buy
this
beer
if
i
ever
come
across
it
again
nice
bottle
and
label
which
adds
to
the
stellar
appearance
the
beer
pours
a
nice
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
fine
malt
scent
that
is
full
of
caramel
and
toffee
aroma
it
also
has
a
tremendous
hop
aroma
that
is
citrusy
and
highly
bitter
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
caramel
flavor
with
a
bitter
hop
edge
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
yet
sweet
with
loads
of
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
great
red
ale
it
has
awesome
aroma
and
taste
a
real
treat
overall
dangerously
drinkable
and
at
just
under
6
alcohol
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
without
getting
too
drunk
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
i
think
i
will
go
have
some
more
outstanding
beer
overall
will
try
again
very
nice
although
ive
never
had
an
irish
red
like
this
maybe
more
brewers
should
follow
suit
drinkability
is
good
one
of
the
better
reds
out
there
even
with
its
small
imperfections
buy
some
now
if
you
can
give
it
a
try
know
i
will
be
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
tan
head
over
the
slightly
hazy
yet
still
clear
coppery
amber
brew
head
dims
but
stands
tall
at
half
height
with
delicate
if
somewhat
sparse
lacing
aroma
is
malty
to
style
yet
the
piney
hops
are
an
integral
part
here
as
well
taste
is
almost
perfectly
balanced
with
ample
grains
and
hops
complementing
each
other
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
superb
for
the
style
going
down
creamily
and
with
ease
best
red
ive
had
at
least
in
a
long
time
if
not
best
period
drinkability
perfect
balance
of
big
beer
flavor
and
approachability
a
topnotch
beer
for
crossover
crowd
tasting
parties
one
of
the
most
sessionable
beers
in
bomber
format
ive
ever
had
thanks
joe
for
luring
us
to
this
well
stocked
indiana
packy
its
been
2
days
since
i
have
had
a
brew
from
the
masters
at
3f
and
i
am
feeling
the
hop
need
drinkability
nothing
like
any
irish
red
ale
that
ive
sampled
before
but
not
a
big
surprise
coming
from
three
floyds
this
one
seems
to
be
some
kind
of
irish
red
hybrid
but
succeeds
on
its
overall
quality
and
fine
construction
excellent
drinkability
the
amarillo
hops
really
work
well
here
very
tasty
22
ounce
bomber
this
beer
pours
out
dark
red
with
a
large
dense
head
for
a
beer
this
smells
a
lot
like
grapefruit
there
is
also
caramel
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
grapefruit
again
but
not
at
all
sour
or
bitter
malt
flavors
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
while
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
it
is
somehow
light
and
fluffy
addictive
drinkability
hop
burps
are
among
the
best
ive
had
between
this
beer
and
the
gumballhead
three
floyds
has
proved
how
far
they
can
take
what
are
usually
known
as
nonexperimental
styles
of
beer
another
damn
fine
beer
from
three
floyds
only
drawback
could
be
price
at
6
99
for
a
bomber
i
can
see
having
one
or
two
a
year
knock
that
down
to
6
99
a
sixer
and
ill
have
at
least
a
case
a
year
definitely
worth
a
try
at
any
rate
i
have
been
on
a
streak
lately
with
some
great
beers
this
one
courtesy
of
starchild
it
pours
a
firebrick
red
out
of
the
bottle
very
clear
great
light
refraction
against
the
wall
thick
foam
head
stringy
lace
nose
is
old
pine
with
an
awesome
malt
and
caramel
backdrop
it
is
what
my
martha
stewart
so
refers
to
as
worn
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
malty
and
piney
only
more
pronounced
lots
of
roasted
caramel
on
top
of
a
nice
hop
layer
that
provides
a
great
balance
maybe
a
little
ctrius
too
but
i
cannot
narrow
as
to
what
citrus
is
could
be
mouthfeel
is
halfway
between
medium
and
full
bodied
nice
finish
that
leaves
the
mouth
dry
enough
to
want
another
sip
bit
not
so
dry
that
the
sip
needs
to
be
water
drinkability
was
high
for
the
aggression
of
this
brew
really
enjoyed
and
savored
each
glass
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
an
irish
red
as
well
i
would
expect
a
bit
more
body
from
the
makers
of
dark
lord
but
i
was
let
down
not
one
to
seek
out
again
at
least
not
in
my
book
freed
from
its
bomber
this
brew
fills
my
glass
a
red
orange
hue
with
some
haze
slight
whitish
head
aroma
is
hoppier
than
i
would
have
expected
not
at
all
a
bad
thing
toasty
malt
and
sweet
caramel
coexist
with
clean
citrous
and
floral
hops
smooth
malts
lead
the
flavor
with
some
toasty
breadiness
apparent
as
well
as
hints
of
caramel
hops
are
crisp
and
present
in
a
big
way
bitter
citrous
and
some
resinous
pine
threaten
the
malt
backbone
quite
hoppy
for
an
irish
ale
but
youll
never
hear
me
complaining
about
that
finish
is
slightly
drying
citrous
mixed
with
a
little
sweetness
cheers
to
three
floyds
for
their
take
on
the
style
drinkability
smooth
and
wonderfully
drinkable
this
would
make
an
excellent
daily
drinker
if
i
could
get
more
of
it
the
body
is
so
smooth
with
loads
of
malt
complexity
hops
are
well
shown
here
but
not
near
as
dominant
as
in
the
nose
plus
theyre
really
not
that
bitter
just
flavorful
which
is
good
for
an
irish
red
imo
caramel
biscuit
pine
and
light
fruit
notes
are
in
the
malts
nothing
too
sweet
in
fact
sweetness
is
held
to
a
minumim
great
balance
tons
of
flavor
without
any
excess
sweetness
or
bitterness
very
well
made
i
bet
the
irish
would
drink
this
by
the
gallons
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
all
hops
bunches
and
bunches
of
citrus
hop
with
just
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
the
flavor
doesnt
have
the
extreme
hop
profile
that
the
aroma
foretold
but
theres
still
some
hop
flavor
slightly
fruity
with
a
nice
malt
character
pretty
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
light
body
and
easy
to
drink
special
thanks
to
cmaruschak
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
nice
long
lasting
head
and
great
lace
an
immense
amout
of
hop
bouquet
is
immediate
citrusy
and
although
you
know
some
nice
carmalized
malt
is
in
there
it
is
not
very
detectable
due
to
all
the
hop
fragrence
upon
tasting
the
hops
are
not
as
immediate
and
some
of
the
malts
come
shining
through
a
bit
fruity
suprisingly
light
considering
the
color
the
hoppiness
of
it
balances
out
the
malts
nicely
and
make
it
much
more
drinkable
proabably
a
bit
to
hoppy
for
the
style
but
a
damn
tasty
and
quality
beer
cracked
open
the
bottle
and
immediately
smelled
hops
poured
the
entire
bomber
into
a
large
mug
the
red
body
with
a
cascading
thin
head
with
tons
of
carbonation
smells
of
flowery
hops
with
a
bitter
back
to
it
fruits
maybe
a
peach
or
apple
and
caramel
malt
taste
hops
are
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
with
a
nice
sweet
caramel
and
even
a
little
fruit
more
of
the
apple
seems
to
be
coming
through
let
me
take
a
second
drink
definitely
taste
more
of
the
caramel
with
the
hops
i
can
probably
drink
this
entire
glass
within
the
next
five
minutes
but
i
shall
savor
it
instead
a
clear
teasteeped
reddish
liquid
with
a
nice
head
of
white
foam
that
syats
around
for
the
long
haul
aromas
are
the
unique
three
floyds
hop
blend
amarillo
this
reminds
me
of
a
pumped
up
red
version
of
yards
newest
edition
of
their
phily
pale
ale
anyways
the
aromas
is
all
citrusy
hops
pineapple
and
toasted
biscuity
malts
nice
the
taste
is
juicy
with
the
fresh
hops
and
nicely
malty
as
well
with
a
sweet
biscuity
kiss
this
stuff
just
smells
and
tastes
so
fresh
and
juciy
that
it
slides
down
the
throat
with
eaze
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
excellent
orangeamber
body
lasting
beige
ring
rather
dull
aroma
this
seems
so
simple
and
feels
like
déjà
vu
as
much
as
anything
else
ample
grapefruitytangerine
like
hops
dominate
while
being
fairly
fragile
the
leafy
and
rocky
aroma
mineral
palate
thinmedium
bodied
highly
carbonated
very
dry
palate
boasting
more
astringent
hops
than
is
recommendable
very
earthy
herbal
lichen
algae
those
hops
feels
raw
and
attaches
to
the
palate
this
is
not
aggressive
its
just
dull
in
the
same
sense
than
a
fly
you
want
to
push
away
i
do
like
dreadnaught
and
alpha
king
but
i
dont
recognize
3
floyds
here
i
always
cant
wait
to
taste
a
new
to
me
3
floyds
product
so
i
had
to
try
this
the
day
i
bought
it
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
tall
cream
colored
head
streaky
lacing
was
left
on
the
glass
big
piney
hop
nose
this
hit
me
as
a
bit
of
a
surprise
with
a
red
ale
but
then
again
it
is
3
floyds
even
with
the
huge
hoppiness
there
is
a
great
sweet
maltiness
that
manages
to
show
itself
very
excellent
aroma
caramel
malt
upfront
on
the
flavor
with
a
backend
hop
kick
floral
and
piney
hops
are
plenty
tasty
stuff
that
ends
with
a
bitter
sweet
finish
great
mouthfeel
and
it
is
quite
creamy
very
easy
drinking
and
it
is
quite
sessionable
reminds
me
of
what
they
did
to
the
porter
with
alpha
klaus
great
stuff
all
around
especially
for
the
hop
heads
overall
the
beer
leans
heavily
towards
the
hops
moreso
than
id
anticipate
for
the
style
but
still
a
very
tasty
product
it
carries
all
the
character
of
a
beer
brewed
by
the
floyds
in
indiana
clean
bright
bitter
with
an
appropriate
malt
as
called
for
by
the
style
definately
worthwhile
thanks
to
orbitalr0x
for
this
one
it
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
finger
over
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
nice
and
piney
with
a
good
sweet
caramel
underneath
the
hop
very
nice
the
flavor
is
actually
more
mellow
than
expected
how
i
like
it
the
first
to
hit
is
sweet
caramel
followed
by
a
very
mellow
but
very
flavorful
piney
hop
the
feel
is
moerate
wtih
a
moerate
carbonation
as
far
as
red
beers
go
this
is
the
most
flavorful
one
i
have
ever
had
i
know
its
not
what
is
supposed
to
be
for
style
but
damnit
all
if
i
dont
like
this
take
more
than
the
style
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
clear
bright
amber
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
in
my
glass
citrus
fruity
aromas
pineapple
grapefruit
and
caramel
flavors
unlike
any
irish
ale
i
have
ever
had
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
bitter
this
is
very
tasty
a
nice
amber
and
nice
too
to
have
something
not
widely
tried
yet
higher
than
average
carbonation
on
hops
and
malt
and
caramel
more
hophead
feed
grapefruit
floral
aroma
in
hops
midsip
toast
medium
mouthfeel
not
the
best
three
floyd
radekfest
2
that
said
this
is
kind
of
the
maltier
version
of
the
fff
mold
not
surprising
or
even
that
noteworthy
moreover
for
6
a
bomber
i
would
much
rather
go
with
founders
red
rye
which
is
an
absolutely
comparable
beer
for
much
cheaper
pours
a
crystal
clear
copper
color
with
a
dark
tan
head
smell
is
pure
amarillos
nice
lemon
and
grassy
smell
taste
is
dry
and
of
light
caramel
mostly
dominated
by
hops
of
the
amarillo
variety
very
tasty
red
ale
but
nothing
really
irish
about
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
for
the
style
not
too
thick
but
not
thin
by
any
means
i
would
love
to
drink
this
stuff
by
the
gallon
very
nice
but
as
said
before
not
very
irish
this
is
another
great
brew
from
my
favorite
brewery
if
you
can
find
this
you
have
got
to
try
it
i
wish
their
limited
beers
werent
so
limited
and
were
available
in
6packs
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
medium
ruby
color
with
three
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
good
deal
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
little
bit
sweet
but
overall
just
very
very
hoppy
you
can
really
tell
those
amarillo
hops
in
there
the
taste
is
nice
and
malty
at
first
slightly
sweet
and
a
touch
of
honey
flavor
the
finish
is
nice
and
hoppy
but
not
super
hoppy
like
the
aroma
its
actually
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
super
thick
and
heavy
the
drinkability
is
great
as
well
three
floyds
knows
their
shit
im
finishing
this
bomber
but
wont
be
buying
more
22
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
ouav
in
richmond
for
5
99
this
has
very
little
irish
about
it
except
the
label
and
is
an
american
amber
i
absolutely
loved
this
brew
ontap
at
the
hopleaf
in
chicago
so
i
had
a
friend
pick
me
up
a
bottle
from
kahns
on
his
way
to
lafayette
it
appears
to
pour
just
a
shade
darker
than
from
tap
a
nice
ruby
tinged
with
a
light
brown
supporting
a
1
finger
pale
tan
head
citrusy
notes
of
amarillo
are
strong
in
the
nose
as
well
as
a
nice
carmel
maltish
sweetness
a
little
bit
of
chocalate
rounds
out
the
aroma
very
impressive
for
an
irish
red
taste
is
very
crisp
although
one
could
easily
say
that
three
floyds
over
uses
amarillos
i
love
the
edge
that
they
give
to
their
brews
the
intial
citrus
punch
soon
fades
into
a
sea
of
sweet
malt
finishing
with
notes
of
caramel
superbly
drinkable
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
ambersirish
reds
but
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
ill
surely
miss
three
floyds
after
moving
away
in
a
few
months
exceptionally
drinkable
that
is
all
there
is
to
say
about
this
one
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
smooth
creamy
body
that
is
rather
full
this
goes
down
so
easily
i
could
drink
it
all
night
i
must
say
this
is
the
irish
red
i
want
to
be
drinking
on
st
pattys
day
three
floyds
has
done
it
yet
again
highly
recommended
this
beer
named
after
a
rumored
ancestor
poured
a
dark
reddish
amber
color
and
formed
a
nice
off
white
foamy
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
slight
bit
of
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
of
malt
hops
caramel
and
and
slight
hint
of
pepper
the
finish
is
slightly
astigent
with
a
definate
hop
edge
to
it
leave
it
to
the
three
floyd
folks
to
twist
the
formula
leave
it
to
three
floyds
to
break
the
mold
on
a
straightforward
and
common
beer
style
this
beer
is
a
dark
clear
reddishamber
color
with
a
tall
and
foamy
beige
head
thin
patches
of
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
amazingly
floral
with
hops
and
malt
in
the
wings
mediumbodied
and
very
hoppy
with
some
citrus
malt
and
caramel
flavors
the
finish
is
bitter
and
hoppy
yet
somewhat
smooth
stacked
up
against
the
rest
of
the
amber
ales
out
there
this
one
definitely
raises
eyebrows
dthis
is
not
your
fathers
irish
red
it
is
an
irish
red
that
3fs
made
their
own
it
does
have
a
big
burst
of
hops
and
a
great
flavor
however
i
dont
feel
the
malt
is
there
to
support
the
hops
in
this
delicious
monster
at
least
enough
to
call
it
an
irish
red
ale
the
hops
are
all
grapefruit
in
punch
and
i
would
like
to
see
more
dimensions
to
the
hop
characteristics
this
is
another
good
solid
beer
from
3fs
but
not
a
great
beer
yet
i
will
be
buying
more
to
age
while
this
is
far
from
anything
one
might
expect
from
an
irish
red
this
has
definately
been
stamped
by
3f
with
signature
citurusy
hop
flavors
and
bold
yet
tasty
proclamations
of
beer
enthusiasm
still
pricy
for
a
bomber
but
worth
a
shot
for
the
season
so
far
only
availible
at
the
brewery
go
out
and
get
some
if
you
have
the
chance
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of

this
is
a
very
nice
flavorful
beer

drink
for

will
definitely
be

up

a
220z
bottle
from
a
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
this
is
a
wicked
good
beeah
hoppy
malty
tasty
great
smell
too
bad
it
doesnt
come
in
a
six
pack
very
enjoyable
and
dangerously
drinkable
thick
body
with
initial
sweetness
but
the
beer
avoids
being
sticky
carbonation
is
brisk
but
doesnt
break
the
body
up
too
much
sweet
candied

hits
the

to
balance
everything
lingering
cereal
grain
flavors
along
win
a
touch
of
tobacco
make
de
a
unique
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
that
brings
you
to
thoughts
of
a
hawaiian
luau
at
sunset
different
in
a
good
way
with
some
other
hidden
complexities
burnt
sugars
tangerines
faintly
flowery
a
complex
beer
with
lots
of
different
flavors
that
all
work
together
its
also
just
nice
to
sip
and
enjoy
it
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
ruby
colored
with
a
decent
sized
offwhite
head
sweet
caramel
malt
aroma
with
some
piney
hops
to
balance
it
out
medium
bodied
with
a
thick
texture
and
slightly
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
for
8
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
trying
some
of
their
other
offerings
overall
i
bought
this
because
i
liked
the
lobstah
rowing
away
angry
that
being
said
i
do
not
normally
buy
irish
red
ales
as
they
seem
average
in
many
ways
however
this
imperial
version
of
the
style
was
good
light
and
refreshing
for
a
hot
day
in
june
and
the
8
abv
is
appreciated
not
by
my
wife
and
was
hidden
well
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
this
imperial
red
was
a
interesting
twist
on
the
classic
red
ale
cheers
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
in
many
ways
but
the
hops
tend
to
overwhelm
everything
else
had
this
been
marketed
as
a
double
ipa
this
would
not
have
been
an
issue
but
the
imperial
red
ale
note
speaks
to
a
higher
sugar
presence
that
is
simply
not
there
causing
the
beer
to
seem
out
of
balance
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
beer
is
not
delicious
in
fact
i
would
easily
buy
another
bottle
but
its
not
what
i
expected
and
the
result
especially
because
of
the
drastic
difference
between
the
aroma
and
the
taste
was
too
jarring
deep
amber
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
good
lace
and
retention
great
balance
of
sweet
tasty
malt
and
bright
piney
hops
super
creamy
and
thick
with
great
feel
and
finish
although
a
bit
cloying
after
a
while
great
hop
profile
and
definitely
an
imperial
red
as
opposed
to
an
imperial
red
ipa
solid
delicious
beer
for
malt
fans
and
hop
heads
alike
o
enjoyable
but
a
little
strong
at
8
abv
to
be
called
easy
drinking
or
sessionable
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
it
was
likely
a
good
one
to
start
off
saw
a
bunch
of
different
places
in
boston
that
had
an
offering
from
them
on
tap
solid
beer
imperial
red
ale
from
slumbrew
first
beer
ive
actually
tried
from
slumbrew
excellent
taste
kind
of
caramely
and
malty
dark
red
in
appearance
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
large
beer
stein
decent
head
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
thought
it
would
of
had
a
lot
more
flavor
being
a
red
ale
just
had
this
before
christmas
came
around
and
it
surprised
the
heck
out
of
me
delicious
red
ale
very
plain
taste
smell
is
non
existent
no
lacingwalling
at
all
which
is
a
huge
hit
to
the
appearance
score
but
i
do
like
the
color
and
appearance
otherwise
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pay
5per
glass
for
a
subpar
beer
when
they
have
green
flash
and
firestone
walker
on
tap
also
bjs
is
a
great
spot
to
grab
a
bite
and
watch
a
game
or
ten
enjoy
and
find
a
dd
overall
really
enjoyed
this
red
ale
the
strongbodied
taste
is
a
surprise
after
minimal
odor
very
nice
red
ale
would
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
i
can
understand
the
fairly
high
reviews
would
have
liked
to
see
more
head
but
the
lack
of
it
might
have
been
due
to
a
weak
pour
recommend
this
beer
at
greenwood
indiana
location
poured
an
excellent
deep
red
with
wonderful
head
and
very
nice
lacing
huge
deep
malt
scent
with
a
nice
tang
in
the
nose
wonderfully
deep
malty
scent
with
a
great
tang
and
hints
of
chocolate
very
smooth
rich
and
deep
with
no
hint
of
the
relatively
high
abv
my
favorite
at
bjs
pours
a
clear
light
brownishred
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
slight
fruity
aromas
taste
is
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
on
the
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
red
ale
but
like
the
nutty
brewnette
the
alcohol
on
the
finish
is
slightly
jarring
would
like
them
find
a
hop
bill
similar
to
their
pihrana
pale
substituted
for
this
beer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
it
was
on
the
verge
of
being
a
little
too
sweet
but
turned
out
pretty
well
overall
a
solid
malty
red
ale
poured
a
reddishbrown
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
left
some
patchy
lacing
basic
aroma
of
sweet
malts
caramel
toasty
same
in
the
taste
with
nice
caramel
malt
sweetness
mild
hop
bitterness
and
just
a
hint
of
the
aboveaverage
alcohol
content
a
little
chewy
with
a
slightly
off
aftertaste
but
nothing
intolerable
medium
bodied
and
nicely
drinkable
had
this
beer
las
night
as
a
part
of
their
8
beer
sampler
overall
i
have
to
say
that
the
jeremiah
red
was
my
favourite
it
had
a
deep
reddish
amber
colour
which
immediately
caught
my
eye
there
was
a
bit
of
head
but
not
much
lacing
the
smell
was
wonderful
with
a
slightly
fruity
aroma
at
first
followed
by
some
malt
notes
and
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
the
taste
was
quite
bold
with
rich
caramel
and
toffe
malt
flavours
paired
with
the
slightest
bit
of
hoppiness
which
was
riminiscent
of
the
aroma
a
slight
bit
of
fruitiness
but
almost
no
alcohol
except
for
a
slight
tingling
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
for
the
reported
abv
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
the
beer
was
well
balanced
and
my
favourite
of
the
bjs
brews
definitely
getting
a
pint
next
time
i
drop
by
for
a
meal
dvery
drinkable
and
went
perfectly
with
my
burger
melt
a
high
abv
keeps
you
honest
sampler
actually
brewed
by
st
arnolds
brewery
in
sugar
land
tx
for
bjs
pours
a
dark
ruby
amber
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
some
breadiness
and
light
fruity
nose
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
with
some
hops
palate
is
nice
med
body
good
carbonation
finish
is
sweet
caramel
malt
ending
with
a
slight
hoppy
fruitiness
overall
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
irish
the
drinkablility
of
this
beer
is
high
i
really
liked
it
i
would
go
as
far
as
call
it
a
session
beer
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
which
is
about
one
finger
in
size
and
gives
way
to
web
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
malt
backbone
with
some
roasted
malt
and
hint
of
ever
so
slightly
of
hops
the
taste
has
a
caramel
malt
backbone
along
with
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
in
the
middle
there
is
a
hop
bitterness
of
wet
hops
and
earthy
hops
as
well
as
some
dark
fruit
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
is
an
easy
drink
its
not
as
complex
in
the
nose
as
i
would
like
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
good
it
has
a
nice
balance
d
no
thanks
i
didnt
even
finish
the
sample
size
time
to
move
along
d
very
drinkable
indeed
i
drank
the
whole
thing
a
vigorous
pour
into
a
pint
glass
yielded
over
an
inch
of
off
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
as
it
is
consumed
it
is
copper
colored
i
smell
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
i
am
drinking
this
growler
two
days
after
purchase
but
it
has
held
its
carbonation
very
well
it
is
malty
in
taste
and
goes
down
pretty
well
bjs
is
not
my
favorite
brewpub
but
the
old
lady
likes
the
food
as
do
i
so
i
will
continue
to
go
there
hey
its
better
than
drinking
miller
lite
at
a
chain
restaurant
d
decent
beer
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
i
simply
went
off
of
the
red
ale
name
without
reading
anything
about
expecting
an
irish
red
i
got
a
bit
of
shock
upon
first
taste
but
when
i
corrected
the
style
in
my
head
it
allowed
me
to
see
it
was
a
good
beer
srong
toffee
malts
combine
well
with
sunkist
barley
notes
for
bright
caramel
tastes
and
a
depth
of
kilned
barley
variations
dark
coppermohogany
in
color
this
beer
releases
a
thick
dense
barleystained
head
that
lasts
the
session
and
laces
very
well
the
malts
dominate
the
beer
throughout
however
theres
a
fresh
hop
flavor
piney
and
grassy
that
only
shows
up
in
the
taste
everso
lightly
in
the
nose
and
struggles
for
balance
in
the
mouthfeel
alcohol
content
is
evident
with
a
sharp
prickle
to
the
mouth
and
light
numbing
confectionate
sweetness
accompany
the
barley
notes
from
nose
to
finish
while
always
edging
out
the
hops
finishes
with
that
cottoncandy
sweetness
and
alcoholic
numbness
yes
bold
for
a
red
which
hurts
drinkability
but
i
like
it
for
a
variation
probably
the
best
irish
red
i
have
had
i
am
not
surprised
it
has
received
medals
the
appearance
of
this
is
beer
is
a
light
coppery
color
moderate
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
was
consumed
the
nose
is
excellent
a
malty
and
ever
so
slight
citrus
hint
at
the
end
it
has
a
wonderful
light
malty
flavor
with
a
good
hop
balance
i
had
to
go
for
two
of
these
it
packs
a
heavier
punch
than
most
irish
style
reds
at
7
4
abv
without
a
doubt
the
best
of
the
yearround
beers
that
bjs
has
to
offer
d
very
dirnkable
beer
a
nice
tasting
choice
in
a
style
that
has
a
lot
of
pretty
average
beer
the
pour
is
an
amber
color
with
a
reddish
hue
the
nose
faint
and
hard
to
describe
the
taste
has
a
very
complex
malt
character
there
is
a
sweet
roasted
toasted
and
caramelized
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
the
finish
is
clean
and
sweet
and
simple
with
hints
of
bitterness
overall
very
tasty
beer
great
malty
brew
back
in
the
day
it
was
probably
my
favorite
i
can
remember
getting
a
keg
of
this
for
my
23rd
birthday
worst
hangover
ever
pretty
much
like
most
reds
except
with
a
little
more
punch
to
it
the
bitterness
as
with
most
bjs
brews
comes
on
strong
at
the
end
it
was
not
as
smooth
as
i
would
have
hoped
a
pleasant
lunch
at
bjs
this
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
and
some
nice
lacing
it
had
a
mildly
fruity
aroma
the
taste
was
a
little
more
malt
than
fruit
but
still
was
a
nicely
balanced
beer
i
think
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
probably
would
have
enjoyed
this
a
little
more
if
it
was
the
only
style
i
drank
at
lunch
on
tap
at
bjs
in
cupertino
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
body
with
a
white
head
good
retention
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
and
some
fruitiness
taste
is
sweet
malty
caramel
and
a
bit
nutty
this
is
no
arrogant
bastard
but
it
still
hit
the
spot
finish
is
dry
and
grainy
good
amount
of
hops
for
the
style
good
drinkability
for
its
abv
a
decent
brew
that
i
would
drink
again
drinkability
its
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
nice
to
enjoy
with
a
pizza
id
gladly
have
it
again
original
review
from
142005
this
is
another
one
of
the
standard
bjs
beers
that
are
apparently
brewed
yearround
at
all
locations
jeremiah
red
is
a
deep
redamber
in
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
light
and
somewhat
fruity
the
taste
is
very
nicely
balanced
with
fruity
notes
the
finish
is
a
little
bit
more
malty
abv
is
not
perceptable
at
all
this
is
another
very
good
beer
from
bjs
though
the
taste
is
just
a
step
from
great
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
the
alcoholic
content
is
blended
well
keeping
the
drinkability
high
drinkability
definitely
a
high
octane
and
malty
red
but
drinkablility
suffers
slightly
with
the
higher
alcohol
level
drinkability
for
those
who
prefer
malts
over
hops
this
is
a
wellmade
and
easily
consumed
brew
the
red
is
copperhued
little
beauty
a
bit
more
red
than
most
copper
bodies
the
smallish
offwhite
head
did
some
mild
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
and
slight
whiffs
of
friuty
spice
the
flavor
is
spicy
as
well
with
good
malt
presence
the
feel
is
medium
with
a
fine
finish
very
nicely
drinkable
had
this
one
on
tap
and
then
i
got
a
growler
to
come
home
with
me
it
poured
with
a
huge
off
white
head
that
lasted
for
a
good
5
minutes
before
it
settled
into
a
nice
lace
there
was
not
much
smell
at
all
comming
off
this
brew
other
than
malt
and
once
i
started
drinking
i
found
out
why
the
beer
was
allmost
all
malt
with
very
little
hop
bitterness
and
spice
but
it
seemed
to
work
out
just
fine
everything
mixed
together
wonderfully
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
brew
like
i
said
i
brought
a
growler
home
and
most
of
my
friends
who
are
not
into
the
stuff
i
get
really
liked
it
so
this
may
be
a
good
crossover
brew
jeremiah
red
is
a
decent
if
understrength
beer
the
7
1
abv
came
through
a
bit
strong
but
maybe
because
the
rest
of
the
beer
seemed
to
be
coming
up
a
bit
diminished
in
flavor
medium

the
abv
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
a
nice
red
ale
with
a
lot
of
complex
malt
flavor
sampled
locally
at
the
bjs
at
4901
beltline
in
addison
originally
sampled
on
12
april
2002
in
the
past
ive
never
thought
much
of
red
ales
everyone
i
had
sampled
didnt
have
much
flavor
this
one
did
there
was
plenty
of
malty
flavor
to
enjoy
in
my
opinion
this
is
well
worth
trying
had
it
the
bjs
in
irvine
ca
this
particularly
sampling
of
red
was
from
the
cask
with
a
large
dose
of
east
kent
goldings
to
pick
up
the
nose
normally
a
bright
deep
ruby
color
the
cask
version
of
the
beer
was
a
hazy
brown
with
virtually
no
head
on
the
pour
the
ekgs
were
prominent
as
intense
floral
notes
in
the
aroma
while
they
lent
the
palate
a
lingering
grassiness
the
beers
flavor
is
a
crystal
malt
chewy
extravaganza
cut
by
a
strong
tingling
sensation
of
alcohol
and
american
bittering
hops
the
beer
arrived
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
there
was
a
roastiness
in
the
aroma
that
i
wasnt
expecting
of
an
amber
ale
the
roastiness
held
over
into
the
taste
also
it
was
more
of
a
stout
in
its
taste
but
a
hair
lighter
which
is
to
say
by
no
means
was
this
a
light
beer
this
was
very
full
bodied
and
flavorful
quite
tasty
in
fact
as
one
would
expect
a
sanguineous
color
the
head
portly
and
the
consistency
spumescent
tan
in
color
and
the
residual
lace
a
nice
sealing
sheet
nose
is
sweetly
malt
fresh
and
clean
with
a
maltladen
start
top
middling
in
its
feel
finnish
is
mildly
acidic
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
dry
lingering
aftertaste
cheers
its
a
goodlooking
red
and
its
actually
red
the
smell
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
it
does
have
a
nice
malty
sweetness
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
its
nothing
spectacular
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
are
present
but
the
flavor
is
just
a
bit
lacking
the
alcohol
content
was
a
little
high
and
noticeable
considering
the
style
had
this
once
in
nyc
on
tap
caught
me
off
guard
way
better
on
draft
than
in
nitro
can
o
the
taste
and
aroma
are
pretty
bland
but
its
the
mouthfeel
that
ruins
this
its
like
beer
flavoured
water
no
taste
whatsoever
weak
consistency
but
still
totally
under
my
expectations
bitterness
is
completely
nonexistent
overall
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
with
but
one
word
boring
if
it
was
in
fact
a
premium
5
beer
it
would
probably
be
alright
the
right
flavours
are
there
they
are
just
way
too
muted
add
to
that
a
price
tag
over
au75
for
an
equivalent
case
of
24
x
330ml
and
youve
gotta
be
joking
prost
lampertland
food
match
i
would
have
previously
said
irish
pub
fare
stews
and
shepherds
pie
but
now
at
the
new
flavourless
3
8
abv
version
i
say
plain
crackers
with
cream
cheese
for
dipping
also
make
sure
that
cream
cheese
doesnt
have
any
added
flavourings
i
suppose
not
many
3
8
beers
really
get
me
excited
and
this
is
no
exception
theres
not
much
going
on
here
shes
a
pretty
average
brew
not
the
grandest
of
ripsnortingly
pungent
flavours
going
on
here
i
suppose
but
perhaps
this
isnt
the
venue
for
such
a
thing
the
irish
and
we
willing
tourists
and
diaspora
if
i
recall
correctly
use
this
type
of
watery
sideshow
as
a
respected
moderator
for
their
whiskey
habit
i
sure
could
go
for
some
of
the
latter
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
taste
is
so
watery
it
doesnt
taste
like
an
irish
red
at
all
of
course
it
doesnt
advertise
itself
as
one
either
it
self
identifies
as
a
smooth
irish
ale
mildly
hopped
water
with
a
hint
of
grain
is
how
i
would
describe
this
maybe
it
tasted
better
before
molson
coors
bought
it
who
knows
but
this
doesnt
really
taste
much
like
beer
its
lack
of
carbonation
makes
its
thinness
even
more
noticeable
that
mouthfeel
of
cold
flat
water
makes
it
refreshing
but
lacking
in
any
beerlike
quality
overall
this
isnt
really
the
beer
for
me
it
tasted
fine
but
its
just
not
something
im
really
into
o
quite
honest
irish
red
ale
typic
pub
ale
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
ideal
for
a
session
it
is
along
the
same
lines
as
a
kilkenny
irish
cream
ale
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
every
now
and
then
mouthfeel
is
smoothcreamy
a
bit
watery
as
the
carbonation
dies
down
outstandingly
drinkable
a
long
session
could
be
built
around
these
if
they
were
drunk
fast
had
this
at
an
irish
pub
in
toronto
was
hoping
for
a
pint
of
murphys
irish
stout
but
they
were
out
of
it
so
decided
to
go
with
caffreys
pours
a
clear
amber
colour
a
finger
of
nitroassisted
white
head
is
there
and
doesnt
dissipate
at
all
some
very
mild
lacing
some
floral
hops
with
a
lot
of
caramel
in
the
smell
flavour
actually
has
more
bitterness
than
i
remember
some
sweetness
as
well
creamy
mouthfeel
from
the
nitro
this
is
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
though
notes
from
old
chicago
2001
a
beautiful
pour
from
a
nitrokeg
it
takes
forever
to
separate
when
it
does
it
is
a
clear
redgolden
with
a
creamy
nitroinfused
head
the
aroma
is
very
mild
much
better
in
terms
of
flavor
while
still
a
bit
mild
for
my
tastes
it
has
a
definite
apricot
note
that
i
rather
enjoy
as
would
be
expected
given
the
means
of
dispensation
it
is
very
clean
and
smooth
on
the
palate
it
lacks
a
certain
richness
but
its
not
bad
overall
this
reminds
me
of
my
beloved
john
smiths
extra
smooth
poured
a
beautiful
deep
amber
with
a
creamy
and
persistent
head
i
didnt
get
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
but
the
toffee
and
malt
flavour
was
really
enjoyable
carbonation
is
low
and
very
fine
the
problem
with
this
is
quaffability
i
can
smash
down
a
whole
pint
before
i
can
even
taste
it
so
drinkability
is
huge
theres
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
terms
of
complexity
and
it
is
a
bit
watery
but
this
suits
me
as
long
as
the
flavour
is
there
and
though
the
toffee
and
caramel
is
subdued
its
still
there
and
balanced
good
but
not
great
d
a
tasty
irish
ale
and
great
to
have
on
tap
nothing
mind
blowing
here
just
an
allaround
tasty
beer
d
my
favourite
beer
on
tap
at
one
of
my
favourite
pubs
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
have
to
say
this
was
way
too
easy
to
drink
like
flavoured
water
the
smell
is
pleasant
and
the
taste
is
sweet
the
beer
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
it
definitely
lacks
something
the
taste
is
very
straight
forward
and
not
too
complex
which
prevents
the
beer
from
being
a
really
great
one
rather
average
but
not
at
all
unpleasant
d
even
with
its
faults
its
a
highly
drinkable
beer
d
this
reminded
me
of
a
darker
boddigtons
ale
no
flavours
are
strong
in
this
very
bland
and
pale
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
maybe
its
the
style
it
self
but
its
a
weak
beer
more
sips
revealed
nothing
intereting
whatsoever
its
the
most
unrewarding
beer
ive
ever
sampled
i
bought
a
12
pack
for
8
making
each
can
only
66p
so
ive
no
probelms
in
giving
the
rest
away
or
pouring
it
down
the
sink
a
complete
waste
of
drinking
time
poured
into
a
pint
glass
translucent
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
very
little
lacing
was
surprised
by
how
light
colored
this
was
for
the
style
the
smell
was
predominantly
yeasty
biscuit
toffee
and
apple
while
the
flavor
was
exceedingly
dominated
by
malt
the
mouthfeel
however
was
velvety
smooth
and
mediumbodied
likely
the
result
of
the
nitro
felt
nice
enough
to
session
but
didnt
have
the
requisite
flavor
i
dont
think
that
ill
buy
this
one
again
drinkability
this
lacks
taste
for
me
there
just
seems
to
be
no
substance
behind
it
the
smoothness
of
the
feel
is
impressive
but
without
taste
it
is
sadly
a
subpar
beer
nothing
surprising
nothing
outstanding
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
it
though
doverall
a
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
its
not
likely
i
will
buy
it
again
it
looked
and
smelled
great
but
the
taste
was
a
bit
to
meek
for
my
taste
it
must
be
tough
to
make
a
beer
this
bland
and
flavorless
the
good
news
is
that
there
are
no
bad
tastes
but
pleasant
flavors
are
also
mia
this
is
one
bland
and
watery
beer
drinkability
very
good
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
is
a
bit
expensive
for
a
4pack
but
definitely
a
good
beer
that
helps
remind
that
spring
is
coming
bought
this
can
at
somerfields
british
supermarket
chain
not
impressed
by
the
smell
somewhere
around
not
very
fresh
fish
and
wet
hay
i
almost
felt
being
at
billingates
market
the
fishy
smell
disperses
a
bit
after
a
while
though
taste
is
creamy
and
malty
paired
with
fresh
hops
but
not
very
powerful
mouthfeel
is
rather
watery
all
in
all
a
rather
below
average
brew
i
tried
this
beer
on
march
15
2008
at
mccabes
irish
pub
in
guelph
ontario
canada
the
beer
was
a
nice
translucent
orangegold
colour
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
experience
the
aroma
was
primarily
malt
with
a
slight
hoppish
hint
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
creamy
with
very
light
carbonation
when
taking
into
account
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
flavour
was
nothing
more
than
malted
water
one
could
easily
drink
56
of
these
as
they
go
down
easy
on
this
day
one
was
enough
for
me
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
irish
red
ale
style
i
wouldnt
reach
for
another
but
not
bad
a
sort
of
lesser
evil
whilst
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
it
lacks
in
other
areas
and
this
is
evident
in
my
rating
whilst
in
ireland
i
tried
both
smidicks
and
kilkenny
and
thought
that
these
were
both
superior
pours
a
deep
red
color
with
a
solid
finger
of
offwhite
head
on
top
nice
and
foamy
a
very
light
touch
of
lacing
nose
is
extremely
mild
but
mostly
caramel
malt
taste
is
likewise
mild
but
with
a
fair
bit
of
caramel
malt
a
little
citrus
a
touch
of
hops
show
up
at
the
end
feel
is
fullbodied
and
creamy
a
meal
in
itself
this
one
was
alright
although
i
wouldnt
have
to
many
because
of
the
thickness
and
the
general
blandness
the
beer
pours
a
clear
red
with
a
thick
white
head
that
holds
beautifully
the
smell
is
sublte
malts
the
taste
is
all
amber
malts
it
is
very
smooth
overall
though
not
too
drinkable
i
really
do
not
enjoy
it
all
that
much
considering
this
beer
shares
my
name
i
was
kinda
underwhelmed
with
it
it
poured
a
light
amber
with
an
inch
white
head
that
stayed
throughout
good
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
standard
of
hops
and
alcohol
and
the
taste
was
pretty
basic
this
was
a
smooth
beer
tho
so
the
drinkability
is
high
however
i
think
id
reach
for
a
tetleys
before
reaching
for
this
cheers
was
foamy
otherwise
a
bit
amber
and
nothing
special
to
look
at
little
in
terms
of
taste
on
the
bitter
rather
than
malted
side
however
there
is
caramel
creamy
mouthfeel
not
too
carbonated
could
not
finish
it
a
bit
of
floral
hop
smell
light
bodied
pours
a
deep
reddishcopper
with
the
nitro
bubbles
reaching
the
whole
way
to
the
bottom
before
they
precipitate
out
and
leave
behind
a
very
tight
white
head
that
is
about
a
finger
high
the
head
stays
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
leaves
good
lacing
classic
nitro
except
for
the
odd
whistling
farty
noise
when
i
opened
the
can
smell
is
faint
with
floral
hops
and
some
caramel
as
well
taste
is
caramel
and
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
watery
and
flat
as
well
but
not
terribly
so
it
just
lacks
the
usual
creaminess
that
is
the
upside
of
the
trade
off
between
appearancemouthfeel
and
tastesmell
the
drinkability
is
very
good
though
if
this
was
my
local
brew
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
its
not
however
and
i
dont
think
id
ever
make
a
point
of
seeking
it
out
or
ordering
it
i
have
had
caffreys
on
draft
in
my
basement
pub
for
a
year
and
cant
find
a
better
nitro
ale
to
replace
it
although
caffreys
has
little
or
no
nose
appeal
the
head
is
very
creamy
and
always
super
smooth
going
down
on
draft
there
is
a
slight
bitter
or
fruity
finish
that
is
clean
and
crisp
this
irish
ale
is
smooth
as
silk
and
enjoyable
in
quantity
or
alone
the
best
nitro
irish
ale
ive
had
well
my
hopes
were
a
tad
bit
too
high
on
this
one
but
only
because
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
for
taste
oh
well
wont
have
to
buy
this
one
again
creamy
and
pleasant
on
the
palate
caffreys
irish
ale
is
not
bad
but
is
unfortunately
in
my
mind
rather
disappointing
pours
a
deep
orangey
gold
color
with
an
amazing
tight
white
head
the
head
could
almost
pass
for
actual
cream
and
it
sticks
around
for
a
while
for
the
life
of
me
i
cant
smell
a
damn
thing
from
this
beer
had
to
smell
some
food
to
make
sure
my
nose
was
actually
working
not
sure
what
to
make
of
that
the
taste
doesnt
really
taste
like
much
sorta
like
the
guinness
nitro
cans
except
not
near
as
sweet
its
slightly
bitter
and
a
very
very
faint
toffee
flavor
but
not
much
else
at
all
mouthfeel
is
great
its
really
creamy
again
it
could
almost
pass
for
real
cream
i
probably
wont
be
getting
this
again
even
tho
i
love
the
mouthfeel
and
appearance
the
flavorscent
just
isnt
there
clear
light
amber
with
an
orange
hue
topped
by
a
dense
white
head
of
fine
bubbles
nitro
really
helps
out
here
great
head
retention
and
it
leaves
a
thick
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
muted
but
theres
some
caramel
maltiness
a
hint
of
fruit
and
some
floral
hops
the
mild
flavour
is
matched
by
low
bitterness
caramel
malt
and
light
fruit
start
things
off
with
hops
kicking
in
towards
the
finish
low
carbonation
of
course
with
a
light
body
and
a
dry
texture
especially
as
it
warms
this
is
a
great
session
beer
especially
on
nitrotap
not
very
complex
but
tasty
enough
to
have
several
yeah
one
of
these
is
probably
enough
its
a
fairly
good
beer
nothing
that
really
stands
out
for
or
against
probably
just
not
my
style
and
going
by
the
description
i
would
say
this
is
fairly
close
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
certainly
a
nice
low
abv
session
beer
its
got
all
the
good
characteristics
of
an
ale
from
the
british
isles
with
the
typical
hearty
amber
ale
fruitiness
a
bit
more
hops
and
it
would
have
been
a
part
of
the
regular
rotation
quite
drinkable
but
could
become
boring
after
a
while
this
beer
lots
really
cool
when
it
pours
as
the
widget
effect
is
one
of
a
clear
body
emerging
from
a
maelstrom
of
foam
well
that
is
the
best
part
as
this
beer
is
underpowered
in
all
aspects
needs
more
malt
more
hops
and
more
finish
i
find
molson
canadian
more
challenging
than
this
brew
bought
the
draft
can
nitrogen
in
the
delivey
poured
a
creamy
amber
with
a
big
off
white
head
virtually
no
aroma
taste
is
watery
and
non
distinct
with
a
quick
finish
where
some
hop
bitters
are
slightly
detectable
a
very
weak
ale
with
a
nitrogen
can
gimmick
the
beer
as
its
spills
from
the
can
a
slightly
hazy

the

the

quite
mild
also
very
dry

a
drinkable
brew
and
one
that
used
to
be
available
readily
on
tap
but
alas
i
can
now
only
find
it
in
cans
mores
the
pity
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
i
found
this
bitters
a
delightful
way
to
spend
time
in
the
airport
someday
ill
likely
give
this
another
chance
just
to
check
and
be
100
fair
not
a
bad
ale
by
any
means
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
made
more
substandard
by
becoming
too
commercialised
price
was
expensive
compared
to
other
nitros
so
will
be
passing
next
time
poured

are

all
that
said

the

on

the

is
actually
not

far
better
english

out

to
quaff
and

this
one
falls
along
the
wayside
hey
waitress
i
thought
i
ordered
a
beer
light
brown
color
medium
head
is
a
beige
and
foamy
aroma
is
malty
and
very
sweet
touch
of
fruit
medium
bodied
amber
rich
malt
flavor
slightly
too
sweet
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
rich
smooth
taste
finish
is
smooth
aftertaste
is
malty
slightly
bitter
f
made
the
mistake
of
following
a
guiness
on
tap
with
this
in
a
nitro
can
the
nitrous
oxide
puts
on
a
good
show
cascading
the
head
toward
the
top
the
final
appearance
is
nice
with
a
deep
amber
hue
complimenting
the
thick
and
creamy
head
unfortunately
the
taste
and
smell
does
not
match
the
appearance
the
smell
is
stale
and
the
taste
somewhat
hard
to
define
but
definitely
leaving
a
sense
of
sourness
no
hops
are
noted
in
the
brew
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
bland
in
its
residual
palate
sense
watery
liquor
taste
not
a
pleasing
taste
to
be
sure
wont
go
back
i
have
had
this
on
tap
a
few
timesa
nice
creamy
look
to
it
with
nice
creamy
head
kind
of
a
dark
gold
almost
amber
color
smell
was
nice
and
appetizingly
sweetthe
taste
was
a
little
bland
for
the
look
and
smell
of
this
one
a
little
smack
of
hop
will
hit
the
farther
down
the
glass
u
go
a
pretty
good
irish
ale
but
nothin
to
spectacular
when
living
in
england
my
place
was
near
an
oniels
pub
which
soon
became
my
local
watering
hole
it
was
there
that
i
was
introduced
to
caffreys
ale
which
soon
became
my
beer
of
choice
i
am
kind
if
biased
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
was
this
beer
that
introduced
me
to
the
wonderful
world
and
awseome
varietys
of
beer
that
is
available
to
us
i
owe
my
eye
opening
to
this
beer
i
asked
for
a
sweet
ale
and
this
is
what
i
got
wonderful
selection
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
had
another
went
back
to
the
same
place
2
weeks
later
simply
to
have
another
and
was
told
it
is
no
longer
made
whats
up
i
loved
this
beer
wonderful
aroma
exceptional
taste
sweet
if
you
like
that
thing
with
a
delightful
flavor
all
its
own
slightly
red
or
coppery
color
would
this
be
considered
an
irish
red
ale
are
there
any
others
similar
this
is
a
very
good
irish
ale
im
not
sure
if
it
would
be
considered
a
cream
ale
but
its
very
creamy
in
color
and
taste
everytime
i
go
to
the
local
irish
pub
i
start
off
with
this
beaut
its
easy
on
the
tastebuds
and
gets
ya
ready
for
the
night
the
head
is
always
a
nice
thick
cream
color
and
its
real
thick
too
the
seperation
it
does
in
the
beginning
is
just
like
guinness
which
is
another
great
beer
in
my
book
anyways
the
finish
is
nice
a
sturdy
but
light
at
the
same
time
its
not
stouty
or
bitter
which
i
think
is
the
reason
it
makes
a
great
starting
out
beer
great
head
creation
and
retention
from
the
nitro
can
a
pinky
finger
width
head
stuck
with
the
beer
all
the
way
til
it
was
gone
i
was
very
impressed
by
that
has
a
very
alluring
redish
orangish
color
to
it
if
this
beer
were
a
woman
she
would
be
a
supermodel
flavor
was
good
but
disappointing
tasted
a
little
watered
down
but
that
may
just
be
the
style
i
have
nothing
to
compare
it
to
kinda
hoppy
and
bitter
fragrance
is
a
reflection
of
that
wow
what
a
different
brew
in
england
i
still
am
not
a
huge
fan
but
the
brew
is
improved
on
tap
and
fresh
it
took
35
mins
to
settle
slightly
sweet
nose
thick
white
persistant
head
sweet
chewy
malt
taste
with
the
usual
hop
metalic
finish
this
is
what
i
dislike
the
tinlike
finish
to
this
brew
it
was
less
watery
than
the
can
but
still
not
a
standout
tried
this
one
in
a
steak
house
pours
a
light
reddish
colour
topped
by
a
thick
white
head
that
settles
rather
easily
its
a
fairly
refreshing
beer
with
nice
smell
and
i
wonder
why
this
ale
is
not
found
in
every
pub
in
cyprus
only
some
selective
pubs
or
steak
houses
have
this
beer
caffreys
ontap
is
less
creamy
than
the
nitro
can
but
seems
to
be
more
substantial
a
decent
session
ale
that
is
quite
quaffable
review
taken
from
notes
before
coors
pulled
the
plug
on
the
brand
in
the
u
s
the
nitro
can
pours
out
a
beautiful
looking
brew
cascading
creamy
coppergold
which
eventually
becomes
translucent
with
a
persistant
thick
white
head
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
somewhat
hoppy
but
very
little
bitterness
overly
creamy
mouthfeel
bordering
on
flat
this
is
a
brew
that
is
slightly
better
than
average
but
doesnt
have
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
interested
typical
nitro
pour
this
one
was
lighter
colored
and
not
quite
as
pretty
to
watch
as
some
when
settled
the
head
is
14
inch
with
hanging
murkiness
beneath
a
little
sourness
to
the
yeasty
aroma
velvet
mouthfeel
pretty
good
toffeelike
malts
and
a
trace
more
hoppiness
than
some
drinkable
enough
but
aside
from
youngs
luxury
double
chocolate
im
geting
pretty
bored
with
these
nitros
just
not
enough
flavor
excellent
pour
that
started
out
butterscotchcolored
then
settled
into
the
more
typical
ale
hue
creamy
almost
to
a
fault
as
there
was
not
much
of
a
beer
flavor
to
it
at
all
slightly
tannic
and
overall
the
flavor
does
not
live
up
to
the
looks
a
very
good
irish
beer
nice
and
thick
although
light
in
color
it
has
a
head
that
really
sticks
to
the
glass
all
the
way
down
very
sexy
a
well
rounded
brew
that
is
balanced
in
aroma
and
flavor
prost
looks
very
nice
with
a
thick
cloudy
appearance
similar
to
guinness
but
obviously
much
lighter
no
smell
or
special
taste
to
speak
of
but
certainly
not
bad
very
easy
to
drink
decent
head
creamy
caramel
tastes
hints
of
homey
and
malt
it
was
way
too
watery
though
bland
bland
bland
sweetfruity
taste
smells
burnt
but
very
very
lightly
creamy
and
quite
drinkable
although
somewhat
thin
these
widgets
are
heavensent
another
amazing
nitro
head
and
plus
it
has
pleasant
burnt
fruit
like
aroma
that
i
always
like
which
translates
itself
to
a
faint
grape
flavor
in
the
mouth
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
but
with
an
extremely
thin
mouthfeel
if
this
had
some
more
body
it
would
be
awesome
malts
and
hops
are
there
but
the
watery
aspect
of
the
body
really
robs
the
essence
of
the
beer
chuggable
nonetheless
creamy
and
bland
but
i
suppose
its
drinkable
but
its
creaminess
doesnt
really
appeal
to
my
tastes
had
it
on
tap
and
from
the
can
they
both
tasted
the
same
this
ends
up
to
be
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
consumed
quickly
it
loses
its
luscious
texture
the
more
the
nitro
pulls
away
from
the
liquid
i
also
had
this
handpumped
in
england
it
was
the
house
beer
at
the
local
pub
and
it
was
smooth
and
creamy
beyond
belief
with
a
subtle
caramel
sweetness
to
cut
the
edge
off
the
bitterness
i
was
thrilled
when
they
finally
started
selling
it
here
but
was
quickly
disappointed
too
watery
and
not
much
flavor
an
average
beer
at
best
perhaps
its
not
fair
to
compare
what
you
get
here
in
a
can
with
what
you
get
there
at
a
pub
though
notes
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
caffreys
is
a
fine
beverage
and
so
easy
to
put
down
that
it
often
scares
me
a
friday
lunchtime
favourite
for
my
buddy
dee
and
i
we
always
have
2
or
10
o
this
is
one
fine
irish
red
bold
and
smooth
fantastic
finish
and
complements
any
dish
o
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
its
probably
my
favorite
irish
red
ale
this
might
not
be
saying
much
but
its
still
quite
good
after
you
have
some
real
good
ales
this
one
is
just
plain
ok
nothing
to
get
excited
about
just
ok
my
last
glass
of
this
tasted
slightly
sweet
a
little
malty
and
metallic
it
also
had
a
metallic
smell
as
well
i
would
stick
to
the
guest
beers
that
are
on
tap
instead
of
the
house
brews
they
do
have
a
very
fine
selection
of
bottles
as
well
i
liked
this
beer
probably
more
than
the
piranha
pale
ale
smooth
and
balance
led
the
way
the
beer
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
small
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
strong
toffee
and
caramel
notes
and
a
little
bit
of
grass
and
earth
from
the
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
great
but
one
of
the
better
yearround
beers
from
bjs
d
a
good
drinker
good
for
a
few
seems
to
fill
the
style
quite
well
average
in
every
way
much
sweeter
and
maltier
also
could
be
that
because
the
ontap
and
growler
were
tasted
on
different
days
there
could
have
been
a
difference
in
the
batch
characteristics
regardless
of
reasons
the
growler
was
very
sweet
too
sweet
not
as
bitter
not
at
all
like
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
ordering
this
beer
on
location
i
will
stick
to
having
in
in
person
from
now
on
and
will
try
a
growler
of
something
different
this
beer
really
needed
a
hoppy
bite
to
balance
out
the
sickly
sweetness
my
wife
ordered
a
pint
of
this
but
couldnt
finish
it
because
it
was
so
sweet
completely
out
of
whack
red
highlights
with
a
brown
body
served
with
a
creamy
beige
head
of
about
a
quarter
inch
streaming
bubbles
keep
it
that
way
the
nose
is
a
bit
light
but
biscuity
sweet
malt
lightly
toasted
the
flavor
is
again
highly
malty
with
slight
notes
of
toffee
along
with
the
toast
lightly
sour
and
puckering
minimal
hops
highly
carbonated
but
decently
fun
ontap
at
chandler
location
this
is
occasionally
put
on
the
weekly
cask
offering
lots
of
malt
reddish
highlights
white
creamy
head
lace
mild
malta
roma
above
avrage
mouthfeel
from
the
malts
a
touch
of
sour
and
a
touch
like
an
old
ale
too
much
carbonation
to
drink
pints
of
it
still
enough
malt
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
poured
a
ruby
brown
in
color
with
no
head
smell
is
all
malt
and
a
little
off
taste
is
much
the
same
not
sure
what
the
flavor
is
but
it
strikes
me
as
a
bit
stale
like
cheap
malts
were
used
in
the
production
of
this
beer
this
strikes
me
as
rather
close
to
your
basic
bmc
not
much
going
on
here
smooth
but
tough
to
finish
not
very
enjoyable
ill
move
on
smooth
earthy
and
peat
flavors
are
dominating
in
this
brew
along
with
sweet
and
toasty
malts
has
a
mild
hop
bite
on
the
finish
candyesque
sweetness
is
a
bit
annoying
and
the
alcohol
feel
is
a
bit
raw
but
a
decently
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
not
mind
drinking
again
one
of
these
days
this
is
the
one
bjs
pimps
as
their
awardwinner
pours
a
bright
copper
with
a
medium
white
head
malty
fruity
aroma
as
advertised
with
some
caramel
sharp
taste
with
earthy
hops
decent
malt
backbone
bitter
but
not
in
a
really
good
way
they
have
better
beers
than
this
on
tap
sampled
this
on
42308
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
reddishamber
color
topped
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
and
some
spotty
lacing
roasted
malty
flavor
with
some
caramel
in
there
it
seemed
slightly
off
balanced
with
a
finish
that
was
a
bit
stale
but
overall
it
was
solid
and
i
liked
it
i
would
order
this
again
at
bjs
not
bad
at
all
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
sweetness
and
the
alcohol
put
a
limit
on
that
factor
clear
orangish
red
pour
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
hints
of
apple
juice
taste
is
similar
with
sweet
apple
like
malt
flavors
and
a
touch
of
balancing
hops
still
thin
overall
but
not
excessively
so
very
friendly
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
was
hidden
well
nice
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
here
as
one
would
expect
a
sangrineous
color
the
head
portly
and
the
consistency
spumescent
tan
in
color
and
the
residual
lace
a
nice
sealing
sheet
nose
is
sweetly
malt
fresh
and
clean
with
a
maltladen
start
top
middling
in
its
feel
finnish
is
mildly
acidic
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
dry
lingering
aftertaste
sample
at
the
columbus
location
this
brew
is
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
medium
beige
head
that
lasts
pretty
well
patchy
lacing
sweet
malt
and
nuts
in
the
nose
mediumbodied
with
a
sweet
malt
character
throughout
along
with
light
roasted
nut
and
hops
flavors
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
nutty
overall
this
is
not
too
bad
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
a
red
ale
not
particularly
hoppy
but
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
bj
beer
offerings
big
copperorangeish
pour
with
a
white
foamy
head
smells
malty
and
tastes
malty
some
hop
overtones
but
certainly
nothing
overwhelming
somewhat
complex
taste
and
mouthfeel
goes
well
with
buffalo
wings
on
tap
at
the
rancho
cucamonga
ca
location
a
sort
of
imperial
red
ale
pours
red
head
is
off
white
foamy
not
too
durable
the
smell
is
subdued
but
it
is
malty
the
taste
very
malty
hops
dont
contribute
much
to
this
beer
starts
with
semisweet
malt
and
then
finishes
spicy
there
may
be
some
very
faint
smokiness
thrown
in
there
too
its
mainly
a
malty
high
alcohol
soup
the
alcohol
is
definitely
detectable
probably
giving
off
the
spiciness
and
creates
a
really
viscous
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
again
its
not
really
my
style
drinkability
i
tend
to
prefer
more
flavoring
and
aroma
hops
in
my
red
ales
but
im
a
major
hophead
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
expecting
a
red
ale
but
i
think
i
would
put
this
more
in
the
strong
ale
category
without
the
big
alcohol
content
this
beer
is
an
interesting
concept
at
least
i
am
intrigued
by
the
description
take
an
uninteresting
irish
red
and
double
the
recipe
to
give
it
some
character
this
beer
sits
a
full
red
color
in
my
glass
and
is
topped
by
a
pale
tan
color
head
that
is
pretty
long
lasting
the
aroma
is
malt
dominated
with
notes
of
caramel
a
fruitiness
that
reminds
me
of
cherries
and
some
toasted
malt
notes
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
malty
with
lots
of
fruity
notes
as
well
i
get
notes
of
strawberry
cherry
caramel
and
biscuits
with
a
nice
honey
glaze
there
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
which
seems
to
make
a
feeble
attempt
at
holding
the
yeasty
fruitiness
and
solid
malt
notes
in
check
this
is
certainly
not
a
bad
thing
either
i
am
really
struck
by
how
fruity
this
beer
is
there
is
also
a
palate
coating
fullness
to
it
that
slowly
melts
to
an
herbal
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
quite
nice
really
lives
up
to
the
verbal
description
this
irish
style
strong
ale
poured
a
dark
redamber
color
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
mild
malty
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
the
taste
was
malty
with
notes
of
caramel
malt
and
a
very
light
sweetness
the
hops
were
mild
a
note
of
alcohol
could
be
detected
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
medfull
body
and
moderate
carbonation
there
was
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
and
overall
this
beer
was
warming
this
was
a
pretty
good
red
ale
my
hope
is
that
this
was
the
result
of
the
pour
or
equipment
because
everything
else
i
have
had
from
alpine
has
been
top
notch
i
will
try
again
in
a
different
setting
this
is
a
sleeper
in

the

in

to
me
o
one
of
the
best
irish
ales
i
have
ever
had
nice
complexity
in
a
style
that
tends
to
lack
it
at
times
big
malt
character
that
drinks
easy
overall
just
a
real
fine
easy
drinking
irish
ale
its
nearly
perfect

a

bready

carries

the

toasted

at

keeping
in

with

finishes
long
and

overall
not
many
irish
reds
are
very
exciting
and
this
is
no
exception
it
is
well
made
though
no
trouble
sharing
this
bomber
overall
interesting
brew
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
maybe
worth
a
shot
very
unique
in
the
land
of
irish
reds
but
not
anything
to
write
home
about
strange
overall
verdict
a
nice
irish
red
from
alpine
but
obviously
this
isnt
going
to
turn
any
heads
when
compared
to
their
hoppy
line
up
still
a
nice
beer
for
someone
who
likes
a
sessionable
malty
beer
o
the
flavor
just
seems
off
on
this
one
some
weird
berries
dont
go
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
low
b
this
makes
me
wonder
about
the
medals
at
beerjudged
events
if
this
won
gold
anything
anywhere
i
dont
see
that
we
the
great
unwashed
horde
of
bas
like
this
so
much
on
the
cask
at
the
linkery
in
san
diego
m
medium
bodied
o
a
tasty
red
a
little
sweeter
than
a
typical
red
very
drinkable
since
its
a
pretty
low
abv
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
balance
of
crisp
hops
and
sweet
malts
hoppier
than
expected
up
front
with
dry
spiciness
and
subtle
earthy
floral
notes
backing
malt
backbone
with
lots
of
sweetness
hints
of
caramel
toffee
rye
hazelnut
apricot
and
other
light
fruit
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
o
very
malty
enough
so
that
its
fatiguing
to
drink
anywhere
near
a
pint
maybe
its
the
style
but
i
dont
really
see
myself
drinking
much
of
this
again
o
this
is
a
pretty
straightforward
ale
that
is
quite
refreshing
and
not
difficult
to
enjoy
ive
been
wanting
to
try
some
stuff
from
alpine
for
a
while
and
this
will
encourage
me
to
continue
my
pursuit
b
t
taste
is
almost
more
along
the
lines
of
a
nut
brown
than
a
red
big
and
malty
a
hint
of
orange
zest
upfront
followed
quickly
by
big
nutty
malts
lots
of
breadiness
as
well
a
decent
red
but
not
as
bold
as
i
was
hoping
for
o
wonderful
malty
flavors
really
refreshing
and
enjoyable
and
thankfully
not
super
sweet
the
taste
is
fairly
sweet
brown
sugar
and
caramel
tempered
by
rye
and
with
a
bready
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
medium
carbonation
while
this
is
a
fine
stab
at
the
style
with
so
many
great
beers
from
this
brewer
this
one
missed
for
me
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
this
just
isnt
a
noteworthy
offering
cheers
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
good
i
really
think
the
10
ibus
is
really
what
is
keeping
this
beer
from
being
a
pretty
great
beer
i
think
its
seriously
lacking
character
and
maybe
dry
hopping
would
just
set
this
beer
above
and
beyond
drink
im
glad
i
got
to
bring
a
bottle
home
normally
i
really
like
what
alpine
does
but
this
was
thin
and
off
flavored
for
me
i
probably
wont
come
back
to
this
one
o
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
its
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
taste
not
sure
its
worth
the
price
in
bomber
form
but
if
you
see
it
on
tap
its
worth
getting
to
try
pours
a
reddish
brown
without
much
head
to
speak
of
i
poured
very
aggressively
and
this
beer
seems
lightly
carbonated
as
no
head
formed
the
mouthfeel
also
has
a
pleasant
light
carbonation
nose
has
simple
caramel
and
lightly
roasted
malts
with
maybe
a
little
coffeetoffee
as
well
taste
is
a
tasty
mouthful
of
different
malts
really
from
light
breads
through
rich
caramel
and
finishing
with
a
touch
of
dark
roasted
malt
good
beer
for
the
style
though
you
could
give
me
a
newcastle
and
i
would
be
sadly
just
as
happy
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
it
is
medium
bodied
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
very
smooth
throughout
with
plenty
of
malt
and
balancing
hop
flavors
a
very
solid
representation
of
the
style
i
would
drink
this
again
o
very
surprising
beer
did
not
know
what
to
expect

sweet

is
good
it
was
a
really
cool
unique
and
good
beer
overall
i
really
liked
all
the
different
malt
flavors
in
it
and
they
all
really
came
together
nicely
not
terribly
exciting
but
drinkable
and
good
for
the
style
d
a
really
nice
beer
all
around
perhaps
my
favorite
irish
red
very
very
well
made
bottle
home
this
beer
is
okay
but
its
a
disappointment
coming
from
alpine
this
beer
is
bright
orange
rust
in
color
with
a
small
dissipating
head
white
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
malt
flavors
its
hard
to
pick
out
too
many
individual
malt
notes
because
the
caramel
dominates
but
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
fruit
peak
out
hops
are
almost
nonexistent
the
flavor
is
the
real
downer
it
starts
out
almost
rich
and
sweet
with
malt
flavors
but
that
quickly
fades
into
an
odd
mess
of
sickly
sweet
and
offkilter
light
roast
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
also
odd
and
not
so
great
i
wish
that
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
hops
or
a
bit
more
direction
with
the
malt
its
not
bad
or
anything
but
this
isnt
a
direction
that
i
particularly
like
all
that
said
i
still
firmly
believe
that
alpine
is
awesome
d
this
is
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
irish
reds
arent
usually
but
it
is
very
drinkable
poured
out
clear
deep
copper
with
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
has
sweet
malty
caramel
and
lightly
roasted
malts
along
with
a
light
smattering
of
hops
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
sweet
caramelized
malts
roasted
malts
and
light
hints
of
vague
hoppiness
it
ends
with
less
sweet
roasted
malts
nice
malty
brew
poured
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
doublefinger
head
some
nice
lacing
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
is
fairly
complex
as
is
often
the
style
with
a
good
irish
red
ale
the
taste
is
all
malt
with
only
the
faintest
hint
of
hop
bitterness
i
can
definitely
see
the
insane
number
of
different
malts
in
this
as
the
taste
is
fairly
complex
nice
and
mediumbodied
and
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
style
thats
not
one
of
my
favorites
overall
it
is
a
tasty
beer
better
than
alot
of
reds
i
have
had
but
for
sure
not
the
best
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
unless
reds
are
your
style
but
it
is
a
good
beer
to
grab
if
you
see
it
notes
this
is
a
solid
irish
red
that
left
a
good
impression
on
me
its
got
a
good
nose
flavor
and
mouthfeel
that
comes
together
to
make
this
beer
quite
drinkable
but
not
necessarily
sessionable
for
me
because
of
its
sweet
nature
you
can
tell
the
guys
at
alpine
know
what
the
hell
theyre
doing
very
solid
d
although
not
a
session
beer
in
my
opinion
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
babies
over
a
couple
of
hours
truly
this
is
a
new
favorite
of
mine
from
alpine
good
work
guys
this
beer
poured
a
deep
red
amber
color
with
a
fast
falling
offwhite
head
minimal
lacing
and
not
a
lot
of
retention
you
can
smell
the
caramel
malts
a
bit
of
toast
and
a
slight
trace
of
floral
hops
not
really
an
irish
red
more
like
a
hoppy
american
amber
had
a
sweet
malty
front
with
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
not
really
an
irish
red
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
a
bit
nicely
flavored
for
an
irish
red
and
the
drinkibility
was
right
on
i
didnt
get
to
drink
any
irish
beers
the
day
before
on
st
patties
day
so
this
was
a
nice
belated
pint
to
celebrate
with
d
a
good
beer
i
really
liked
the
flavour
initially
but
over
the
whole
22
oz
the
sweetness
did
become
cloying
and
hard
to
drink
at
times
still
looking
at
the
overall
picture
it
was
a
nice
pint
glad
to
try
it
a
bit
more
hop
character
would
have
helped
for
sure
taste
confirms
my
suspicions
and
offers
a
welcome
light
yet
complex
malt
flavor
roasty
up
front
segueing
to
a
clean
finish
and
a
dry
aftertaste
hop
bitterness
is
less
than
anticipated
given
the
nose
offers
a
good
carbonation
level
which
fits
the
beer
well
drinkability
is
above
average
for
the
style
due
to
the
relative
lightness
of
the
malts
a
nice
irish
red
that
doesnt
smother
things
with
excessive
malt
notes

this
beer
is

better
as
it
warms
imo
sweeter
more
complex
riper
aroma
d
i
have
recently
realized
that
i
like
reds
for
me
this
is
the
measuring
stick
on
tap
at
pizza
port
carlsbad
pours
a
pretty
dark
but
clear
red
with
lots
of
streams
of
carbonation
present
the
overall
impression
here
is
its
more
of
a
toasty
brew
less
smooth
but
more
flavorful
than
other
macro
irish
reds
ive
had
there
is
a
distinct
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
making
it
feel
somewhat
harsh
it
was
ok
though
a
good
compliment
to
a
pepperoni
pizza
other
than
mandarin
nectar
which
is
okay
i
have
been
supremely
impressed
by
alpine
beer
pure
hoppiness
is
one
of
the
best
dipas
that
ive
ever
had
and
alpine
ale
is
a
damn
fine
apa
mcilhennys
irish
red
may
not
be
in
their
league
but
its
a
wellbrewed
version
of
the
style
and
would
be
my
choice
for
st
patricks
day
if
i
lived
in
southern
california
very
drinkable
i
am
surprised
by
the
restraint
shown
with
respect
to
the
hops
this
beer
drank
almost
like
an
english
brown
ale
hope
to
have
this
again
someday
got
this
beer
from
metallitone1
in
bday
07
and
im
drinking
it
on
st
pats
day
it
pours
a
brilliant
dark
amber
red
and
is
crystal
clear
not
much
to
speak
of
in
terms
of
aroma
mostly
light
caramel
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
pretty
tame
nothing
really
stands
out
here
to
grab
my
attention
the
body
is
good
but
the
flavor
is
weak
what
is
there
is
some
caramel
sweetness
and
malt
this
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
but
ive
been
more
into
bolder
beers
lately
not
really
a
big
red
as
first
percieved
more
a
reddishrye
if
that
makes
any
sense
beer
is
good
happy
red
irish
beering
overall
i
am
happy
to
have
had
this
as
my
300th
review
i
am
surprised
that
i
have
never
had
this
beer
before
it
is
good
and
i
definately
plan
to
make
it
a
regular
in
my
beer
fridge
d
not
half
bad
extremely
drinkable
and
well
balanced
my
kind
of
beer
tasty
well
rounded
smooth
full
candyish
with
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
sweet
fruity
center
that
helps
keep
a
terrific
balance
damn
good
stuff
drinkability
is
very
good
great
transitions
between
flavors
and
progression
of
sweet
roast
and
bitter
overall
it
was
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
a
fine
session
ale
overall

are
either
harsh
island
misnomers
or
sweet
sickly
offerings
this
is
neither
far
from
it
the
high
quality
ingredients
from
the
maris
otter
pale
munich
and
rye
malts
as
well
as
the
pacific
nw
and
european
hops
listed
all
shine
through
a
very
nice
red
and
a
good
solid
drinking
partner
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
the
beer
as
it
sets
in
my
glass
a
limpid
mahogany
color
the
head
average
in
size
frothy
in
texture
light
tan
in
color
and
the
lace
a
decent
covering
upon
the
glass
malt
dominates
the
nose
fresh
and
clean
sweet
as
it
the
maltladen
start
top
is
skimpy
in
feel
finish
is
lightly
carbonated
the
hops
present
and
mild
in
their
bite
dry
aftertaste
average
beer
drinkable
and
pleasant
enough
when
your
into
something
on
the
lighter
side
nice
dark
plummy
red
brown
but
the
head
is
licaking
the
aroma
is
malty
a
bit
roasty
but
little
else
the
flavor
is
more
roasty
than
expected
with
a
light
sweetness
not
a
lot
of
complexity
except
for
a
little
melon
and
really
low
hopping
of
course
low
hopping
makes
sense
for
the
style
but
the
lack
of
fruitiness
doesnt
boring
but
not
bad
o
a
decent
beer
but
that
weird
cherry
flavor
in
the
middle
throws
it
off
a
little
for
me
pretty
good
beer
for
samuel
adams
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
ill
have
a
couple
times
a
year
nothing
special
but
better
than
a
few
other
irish
reds
out
there
a
decent
sam
yearround
ill
take
it
overall
im
very
satisfied
with
this
brew
its
really
much
better
than
the
ratings
suggest
in
my
opinion
o
this
was
a
caramel
bomb
the
bitterness
was
barely
noticeable
and
nicely
balanced
the
malt
this
was
interesting
to
try
against
the
ambers
that
ive
had
it
was
a
simple
beer
but
good
pours
to
a
beige
head
that
lasts
and
laces
color
is
a
maroonish
red
hue
aroma
is
toasty
caramel
sweet
malt
and
spicy
earthy
hops
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
toffeelike
finish
overall
a
very
good
red
simply
the
best
ive
had
pours
a
pretty
dark
russet
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
but
not
a
lot
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
nuts
the
taste
was
mostly
of
malt
with
a
slight
hoppy
bitter
finish
that
lingered
a
bit
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
was
ok
but
nothing
special
in
my
book
yes
i
would
drink
it
again
yes
there
are
better
beers
yes
there
are
far
worse
beers
note
i
am
not
a
professional
beer
taster
the
opinions
in
this
review
are
mine
and
mine
alone
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
think
this
beer
is
delicious
beautiful
copper
color
great
aroma
and
awesome
slightly
malty
taste
not
too
heavy
very
drinkable
in
warm
or
cold
weather
excellent
with
hearty
foods
like
stews
and
potato
dishes
go
figure
o
an
okay
beereasy
to
drink
and
pleasant
enough
not
my
favorite
of
the
12
pack
but
decent
enough
12
ounce
bottle
into
signature
pint
glass
best
before
52014
pours
crystal
clear
reddish
copper
color
with
a
2
finger
dense
and
fluffy
light
khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
nice
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
a
large
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
retaining
the
head
aromas
of
caramel
toast
toffee
brown
bread
light
roast
raisin
plum
herbal
and
yeast
earthiness
nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with
good
balance
of
darkbready
malt
and
fruity
yeast
ester
notes
with
solid
strength
taste
of
big
caramel
toast
toffee
brown
bread
light
roast
raisin
plum
herbal
floral
and
yeast
earthiness
minimal
earthy
bitterness
on
the

with
lingering
notes
of
caramel
toast
toffee
brown
bread
light
roast
raisin
plum
herbal
and
yeast
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
darkbready
malt
and
fruit
yeast
ester
flavors
with
a
nice
malt
forward
profile
and
zero
cloying
sweetness
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
smooth
and
lightly
bready
mouthfeel
that
is
very
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
good
irish
red
ale
good
balance
and
robustness
of
darkbready
malt
and
fruity
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
overall
not
bad
however
i
have
had
better
irish
red
ales
conways
irish
ale
to
name
just
one
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
brew
so
i
dont
think
i
will
be
getting
anymore
of
this
anytime
soon
despite
the
complexity
i
find
it
strangely
awry
as
my
expectation
is
stronger
roasts
and
toasted
malt
the
flavors
are
more
twangy
and
raisin
and
that
simply
seems
wrong
overall
one
of
the
better
irish
reds
ive
had
perfect
beer
for
a
cool
spring
day
would
have
another
had
this
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
the
eleventh
beer
ive
tried
from
sam
this
is
a
pretty
mild
red
from
those
thatve
tried
not
as
smoky
as
im
accustomed
to
a
little
flat
lacking
the
lingering
flavor
that
you
get
out
of
many
like
beers
it
did
however
have
a
great
appearance
beautiful
ruby
red
too
bad
the
flavor
didnt
measure
up
o
a
nice
red
beer
i
drank
it
at
garage
temperature
58f
and
it
was
just
about
right
too
cold
and
i
think
youd
miss
the
taste
sweet
malts
on
the
nose
and
then
on
the
palate
some
roasted
notes
and
plenty
of
sweet
caramel
britishmellow
hops
dry
out
the
finish
and
provide
the
balance
ehh
nothing
special
but
not
terrible
drinkable
and
serviceable
every
daymiddle
of
the
road
kinda
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
very
sessionable
based
on
taste
this
was
by
far
the
best
brew
with
roasted
malts
i
have
had
in
quiet
some
time
if
not
ever
i
was
very
impressed
by
its
crystal
clear
red
color
with
thick
head
and
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
beer
is
silky
and
smooth
going
down
and
the
roasted
maltstaste
mixes
well
with
the
overall
flavor
of
the
beer
the
one
disappointing
part
of
the
beer
was
its
smell
not
as
good
as
i
would
have
like
but
easily
overlooked
with
the
rest
of
what
this
beer
has
to
offer
overall
its
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
irish
red
ales
the
verdict
its
ok
entirely
drinkable
and
mostly
underwhelming
if
only
their
beers
tasted
as
good
as
they
looked
o
i
didnt
mind
having
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
anything
great
it
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
weaker
version
of
a
porter
its
a
good
beer
to
have
even
if
on
the
watery
side
and
would
just
rate
this
as
an
average
beer
poured
into
malt
glass
pours
a
gppd
head
afterwards
does
the
the
bubble
show
and
hoping
for
some
good
barley
malts
in
the
taste
its
really
just
bland
and
resembles
other
high
production
glorp
like
killians
red
save
your
shillings
not
all
that
great
overall
damn
this
beer
tastes
great
definitely
my
favorite
of
samuel
adams
regular
line
up
of
beers
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
certainly
look
for
more
i
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
o
easy
drinking
irish
red
well
balanced
and
true
to
the
style

on
the
palate
initial
sweetness
that
is
very
quickly
counter
balanced
with
a
mixture
of
bitterness
roastiness
and
even
a
somewhat
sour
tone
all
at
the
same
time
so
here
i
am
again
in
a
land
of
red
that
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
suspect
it
isnt
all
that
bad
if
this
is
what
one
likes
just
no
for
my
taste
been
a
while
since
i
reviewed
anything
from
sam
adams
with
a
nice
ruby
color
and
thick
headseems
to
be
the
standard
when
it
comes
to
beers
from
sam
adams
malty
and
not
to
sweet
with
a
bit
of
hop
bite
at
the
end
for
me
i
enjoy
getting
my
feet
wet
with
new
style
through
sam
adams
they
are
usually
very
solid
beers
that
are
good
examples
of
the
style
remarks
did
not
score
a

at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
poured
from
the
bottle
into

sa
irish
red
is
a
redamber
color
surprise
with
a
cream
colored
thick
soapy
head
the
nose
is
faint
but
is
of
caramel
and
grainy
notes
flavor
also
seems
a
little
muted

definitely
easy
drinking
mild
caramel
sweetness
with
a
breadytoasted

hops
only
to

finish
is
very
neutral
somewhat
dry

very

i
dont
drink
many
amber
ales
any
more
but
this
one
is
a
home
run
in
my
book
smooth
and
not
too
sweet
this
is
one
you
could
have
more
than
a
couple
of
3
0
d
this
is
about
as
average
as
it
gets
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
right
either
boring
beer
o
appreciated
this
beer
much
more
this
time
around
a
very
flavorful
and
pleasant
red
ale
several
unique
flavors
going
with
a
small
amount
of
sweetness
highly
recommended
beer
the
rest
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
pretty
decent
red
o
ive
had
quite
a
few
different
red
ales
and
ambers
recently
this
was
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
for
sure
as
far
as
samuel
adams
goes
i
put
this
right
up
there
with
boston
lager
oktoberfest
and
winter
lager
as
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
their
brewery
to
me
the
best
way
to
enjoy
an
irish
red
is
to
let
it
roll
down
the
back
of
your
tongue
this
may
be
a
bad
habit
that
i
acquired
in
college
but
it
seems
to
work
every
time
this
red
pours
a
beautiful
clear
amber
with
not
much
head
to
talk
about
nothing
lasting
anyway
i
get
sweet
candy
and
malts
on
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
caramel
theres
nice
carbonation
i
taste
the
same
finished
by
lovely
sweet
candied
honey
hops
is
there
such
a
thing
can
i
say
this
this
beer
has
everything
id
expect
from
an
irish
red
nothing
more
nothing
less
its
hard
to
describe
this
beer
above
that
i
dont
understand
the
harsh
reviews
as
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
expect
complexity
or
richness
and
find
myself
pleasantly
not
disappointed
boston
can
be
proud
of
this
irish
red
anyone
that
knows
more
about
irish
reds
is
welcome
to
introduce
me
to
the
finer
red
brews
pours
a
clear
orangered
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
grain
and
some
caramel
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
slight
metallic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
i
think
the
smell
is
better
on
this
one
overall
eh
is
about
all
i
can
say
about
this
beer
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
is
not
a
traditional
irish
red
that
i
would
expect
it
almost
seems
like
a
watered
down
version
ill
drink
the
other
3
irish
reds
that
came
in
this
variety
pack
after
having
a
couple
of
more
flavorful
beers
this
was
pretty
disappointing
for
sure
this
is
a
delicious
beer
with
the
briefest
presence
in
my
mouth
that
i
can
remember
a
beer
having
which
again
isnt
unpleasant
probably
best
in
the
summer
when
you
want
a
lighter
though
not
weak
brew
somewhere
between
a
pale
ale
and
an
ipa
though
best
on
its
own
the
slight
sweetness
might
go
well
with
a
light
pasta
dish
or
contrast
with
a
white
clam
chowder
cheers
o
meh
it
was
alright
not
horrible
and
it
was
fairly
smooth
too
ive
had
far
worse
just
a
decent
beer
would
pair
great
at
a
barberque
in
90
degree
weather
id
recommend
it
though
i
probably
wont
have
this
again
unless
its
given
to
me
final
thoughts
overall
the
samuel
adams
irish
red
is
a
bit
of
a
below
average
beer
it
really
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
to
begin
with
and
the
offflavors
dont
help
would
i
drink
it
again
no
o
im
not
really
a
fan
of
red
ales
unless
theyre
super
hoppy
e
g
ob
gknight
lagunitas
imperial
red
and
this
one
certainly
isnt
that
hopped
up
still
it
drinks
well
and
i
could
name
several
sam
adams
beers
that
are
worse
the
flavor
is
okay
not
bad
mild
maltiness
with
slight
fruitiness
in
the
yeast
with
just
enough
hops
to
give
it
some
balance
the
flavor
is
slightly
creamy
with
bready
toasted
taste
yet
the
diacteyl
comes
forward
as
it
warms
with
a
light
tanginess
in
the
yeast
i
am
not
ecstatic
about
the
flavor
is
okay
but
after
one
of
these
i
was
ready
to
move
on
the
style
is
fine
but
this
particular
interpetion
is
not
that
impressive
12oz
bottle
from
a
sampler
12pack
pours
reddishamber
in
color
and
is
topped
with
a
frothy
offwhite
head
that
holds
good
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
as
it
fades
malty
nose
with
caramel
toasted
grain
and
herbal
earthy
hop
tastes
are
sweet
with
caramel
herbal
and
earthy
hop
again
kind
of
sour
with
some
toasty
grain
notes
as
well
thintomedium
body
creamy
with
ample
carbonation
overall
its
what
id
expect
for
a
traditional
irish
red
ale
little
head
out
of
the
bottle
but
a
prettyclear
amber
with
a
fair
amount
of
red
strong
sweet
malt
comes
upon
opening
the
bottle
fair
amount
of
dryness
but
more
is
needed
for
this
style
a
bit
of
fizz
on
the
tongue
from
the
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
tasty
variation
that
is
welcome
but
as
an
irish
red
goes
a
bit
too
sweet
and
needs
to
be
a
tad
drier
a
pretty
good
irish
red
not
as
dry
as
the
traditional
ones
but
a
good
spring
mix
brew
no
doubt
it
pours
a
nice
amber
honey
color
with
a
solid
white
head
with
fine
retention
the
nose
is
a
little
sweeter
than
the
style
usually
allows
for
with
a
woody
sort
of
malt
vibe
and
a
balancing
hop
component
towards
the
end
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
surprisingly
delicate
malt
profile
that
makes
this
a
real
easy
drinking
beer
the
caramel
toffee
english
sort
of
sweetness
comes
out
in
the
middle
before
the
hops
checks
it
in
the
finish
the
hops
are
sort
of
pine
like
foresty
and
more
winter
than
spring
in
this
beer
medium
body
and
average
carbonation
slightly
sticky
finish
and
a
tad
filling
a
better
than
average
irish
red
and
a
fine
addition
to
the
spring
mix
mouthfeel
this
is
a
bit
of
the
light
bodied
side
that
makes
it
rather
easy
to
drink
compared
to
some
red
ales
and
with
its
dry
finish
makes
it
a
good
irish
red
o
not
really
balanced
between
the
smell
and
taste
the
beer
is
kind
of
all
over
the
place
not
as
much
taste
as
one
might
hope
and
even
then
the
initial
flavours
fade
very
quickly
not
terribly
impressed
this
will
be
my
alreadydrunk
beer
if
i
have
to
pick
one
from
the
pack
i
dont
know
how
they
get
this
perfect
copper
color
but
its
a
little
suspicious
lovely
though
and
there
is
a
float
of
foam
finally
on
the
last
pour
of
the
12
oz
bottle
not
a
bad
contender
in
one
of
my
least
favorite
beer
categories
flavor
starts
off
with
the
sweet
malt
notes
but
then
fortunately
different
form
the
nose
there
is
some
grassy
herbal
notes
to
it
then
the
grassy
refreshing
notes
get
subedud
again
by
some
nice
sweet
bready
malt
notes
there
is
some
slight
roast
but
the
sweetness
carries
through
pretty
straight
forward
brew
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
amber
with
a
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
there
are
some
visible
bubbles
rising
in
the
glass
some
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
glass
during
consumption
the
beer
smells
of
caramel
and
lightly
toasted
bread
theres
also
a
mildy
earthy
smell
the
taste
follows
the
nose
theres
bread
crust
and
mild
caramel
sweetness
balanced
by
the
earthy
hops
theres
some
back
end
hop
bitterness
that
is
fairly
mild
but
does
provide
some
balance
theres
almost
a
touch
of
smokiness
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
fairly
clean
and
the
beer
drinks
smoothly
this
is
a
good
beer
compared
to
other
sam
adams
and
irish
red
beers
this
is
a
let
down
for
us
toasted
marshmallow
up
front
sweetish
and
a
little
nutty
caramel
molasses
and
cookie
dough
flavor
build
by
midpalate
vegetal
hops
sneak
in
by
the
finish
creating
some
mildly
spicy
bitterness
mediumbodied
creamy
mouthfeel
not
bad
reminds
me
of
some
scottish
ales
i
have
had
o
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
it
has
a
fair
amount
of
toasty
flavor
and
caramel
sweetness
without
upsetting
the
balance
of
it
being
a
drinkable
beer
i
would
say
that
of
all
the
sam
adams
offerings
ive
had
this
one
would
probably
be
the
closest
to
what
an
appreciator
of
their
boston
lager
would
enjoy
for
these
people
i
would
recommend
it
highly
o
not
sams
best
but
not
a
beer
i
would
be
above
choosing
again
o
nice
beer
but
nothing
special
id
drink
it
again
but
probably
wont
make
an
effort
to
look
for
it
it
did
go
down
easy
rjt
o
cant
say
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
its
hard
to
really
place
what
i
dont
like
about
this
but
it
ultimately
doesnt
come
together
nearly
as
much
as
it
should
o
not
my
favorite
style
yet
i
really
like
this
beer
more
complex
tasting
than
expected
a
little
all
over
the
place
great
look
boring
smell
great
taste
etc
and
if
they
fixed
a
couple
flaws
this
could
really
be
a
champ
im
sure
there
are
better
irish
reds
out
there
but
its
the
best
i
have
had
so
far
and
blows
smithwicks
out
of
the
water
o
pretty
good
beer
but
the
taste
is
just
above
average
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
almost
seems
like
a
starter
version
of
craft
beer
not
as
if
an
irish
red
is
a
very
complex
style
but
there
isnt
a
lot
going
on
it
pours
a
lovely
brownish
amber
with
a
thick
creamy
head
and
medium
retention
and
good
lacing
the
appearance
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
it
has
a
wheaty
boozy
smell
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
kind
of
bland
to
me
it
taste
a
little
metallic
in
the
after
taste
it
has
a
weak
body
but
ok
for
the
style
of
beer
and
decent
carbonation
this
beer
is
ok
at
best
and
i
would
not
order
it
at
a
bar
unless
all
they
had
was
light
american
beers
this
came
in
the
sam
adams
spring
pack
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
it
by
itself
theres
better
irish
reds
out
there
but
they
did
a
nice
job
on
this
one
overall
a
solid
worthwhile
beer
nothing
stunning
but
hits
enough
style
points
and
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
to
drink
samuel
adams
irish
red
2
55
o
this
doesnt
strike
me
as
special
at
all
but
i
havent
had
many
irish
reds
not
worth
the
time
imo
im
happy
about
what
i
have
here
not
a
labor
to
drink
through
i
first
scoffed
when
i
saw
it
included
in
the
spring
thaw
case
and
now
im
out
that
was
easy
my
neighbor
brewed
some
and
did
a
taste
test
with
three
others
this
beer
was
the
best
by
far
and
over
a
signature
irish
red
they
got
this
one
down
overall
this
beer
has
the
looks
but
to
me
is
average
beyond
that
more
body
and
a
little
more
carbonation
and
i
think
this
could
be
a
good
one
drinkable
but
certainly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
red
one
that
you
could
easily
session
but
that
has
enough
flavor
to
be
satisfying
it
pours
a
deep
clear
red
with
a
tan
head
the
head
retention
is
good
and
the
lacing
kicks
in
when
there
is
just
a
thin
layer
of
foam
left
on
the
beer
it
smells
toasty
with
notes
of
caramel
bread
and
some
very
light
hop
aromas
the
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
exected
there
is
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
and
it
is
prickly
the
taste
is
mildly
bitter
and
astringent
up
front
and
then
fades
into
malt
and
caramel
the
finish
is
very
bready
recommended
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
irish
red
im
sure
ill
have
better
irish
reds
in
my
life
and
im
sure
ill
have
worse
samuel
adams
does
a
great
job
of
making
consistent
beers
they
have
a
few
that
are
at
the
top
of
each
style
and
a
lot
that
kind
of
fall
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
and
ill
definitely
enjoy
the
last
bottle
of
irish
red
that
i
have
in
the
fridge
i
wouldnt
mind
buying
another
but
maybe
not
a
6
pack
solid
brew
for
a
good
low
price
caramely
and
creamy
with
just
a
slight
touch
of
bitterness
really
like
this
one
id
certainly
have
it
again
this
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
scent
is
fairly
weak
but
there
are
some
tones
of
malts
the
taste
is
well
blended
with
a
decent
mix
of
malts
hops
and
spices
its
perhaps
a
little
thinner
in
texture
than
i
like
in
a
beer
but
not
bad
drinks
smooth
tastes
good
and
has
that
classic
irish
red
character
overall
not
a
big
fan
of
irish
reds

my
new
st
pattys
day
beer
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
beer
creamy
head
sweet
d
i
think
if
there
was
a
bit
more
in
the
way
of
hops
that
this
beer
would
be
a
little
more
balanced
and
would
rate
way
higher
as
it
is
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
one
that
could
be
sessioned
not
bad
just
needs
a
little
work
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
may
stock
some
in
my
fridge
in
the
summer
months
overall
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
with
stong
malt
characteristic
i
feel
that
the
roasted
notes
is
just
a
bit
too
much
not
over
powering
just
more
than
i
would
want
id
buy
this
again
this
beer
is
a
deep
burnt
copper
color
with
a
firm
white
head
nice
looking
brew
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
caramel
toffeelike
smell
theres
malt
and
a
cookedsugar
smell
backed
by
a
faint
english
hop
scent
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
its
a
little
malty
but
also
quite
sugary
in
the
sensation
at
times
this
is
overthetop
sweetness
without
a
firm
bitterness
for
balance
it
can
be
cloying
the
beer
is
full
bodied
and
quite
tasty
im
not
sure
that
i
could
have
a
lot
at
once
but
i
did
enjoy
it
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
am
amazed
that
a
brewery
that
produces
on
such
a
large
scale
can
craft
such
an
ale
my
hat
is
off
to
samuel
adams
i
feel
like
i
must
revisit
this
beer
soon
just
to
make
sure
i
didnt
have
a
fluke
bottle
that
was
better
than
the
rest
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
thick
for
the
style
boulevards
irish
ale
is
much
better
but
drink
ability
is
still
very
good
i
was
impressed
with
a
macro
pulling
off
a
micro
taste
m
d
sits
pretty
heavy
in
the
mouth
all
around
a
pretty
solid
brew
from
sa
i
honestly
cant
compare
to
more
micromade
irish
red
but
i
think
this
is
a
good
representation
medium
body
and
effervescence
a
solid
beer
though
not
a
standout
a
drinkable
ale
not
sure
id
want
to
have
a
lot
of
it
i
am
not
much
on
the
style
but
this
one
seems
true
to
it
as
far
as
i
can
tell
its
a
lot
like
a
killians
personally
id
prefer
a
little
more
hop
presence
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
but
it
turns
out
i
rather
enjoyed
it
i
like
this
much
more
than
smithwicks
for
the
record
not
a
bad
beer
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
nothing
id
probably
buy
again
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
goblet
the
beer
poured
an
excellent
redish
brown
with
rich
thick
head
with
lacing
that
held
on
for
a
while
malty
roasted
grain
aroma
disappointed
with
the
taste
it
has
a
very
pronounced
metalic
flavor
with
a
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
pleasantly
robust
but
the
drinkability
will
get
low
points
due
to
the
beers
bitterness
i
am
disapointed
with
this
beer
i
would
pick
a
killians
over
the
sam
adams
iresh
red
d
definitely
something
you
could
enjoy
several
of
in
one
sitting
drinkability
very
good
a
well
done
balanced
take
on
an
irish
red
every
sam
adams
seems
to
taste
like
sa
lager
with
one
or
two
small
changes
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
from
that
rule
that
being
said
this
is
a
very
good
and
extremely
drinkable
beer
a
little
bit
sweet
and
just
a
little
overly
malty
but
again
nice
beer
could
drink
it
all
day
the
taste
is
very
true
to
an
irish
red
ale
definately
a
4
5
possibly
even
a
5
a
great
beer
to
celebrate
st
pats
day
even
if
you
are
not
irish
and
if
you
are
irish
drink
it
everyday
the
only
down
point
of
this
brew
was
the
over
carbonation
but
i
have
had
them
not
as
carbonated
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
sam
adams
their
irish
red
is
a
good
solid
beer
and
it
adheres
to
the
style
but
theres
nothing
here
thats
going
to
blow
your
socks
off
poured
from
a
cellar
temp
bottle
into
my
nerax
pint
glass
it
has
a
dark
red
color
and
a
good
sized
head
of
light
brown
foam
minuscule
carbonation
bubbles
are
observable
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
there
is
some
patchy
lacing
the
aroma
has
tones
of
caramel
malts
and
other
sweet
grains
the
flavor
is
mostly
toffee
but
i
can
also
detect
some
bread
grain
flavor
the
is
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
there
is
a
certain
malty
strangeness
in
the
aftertaste
that
i
do
not
like
so
i
docked
it
0
5
points
this
is
a
fullbodied
beer
and
the
carbonation
is
strong
although
not
overpowering
this
is
a
pretty
good
sam
adams
beer
i
can
see
myself
having
a
few
of
them
final
word
makes
a
red
headed
step
child
out
of
killians
sorry
george
dcould
be
a
little
bodler
but
very
good
for
the
style
will
definatley
buy
again
one
of
sam
adams
better
beers
6
99
for
a
six
pack
across
the
border
in
delaware
i
can
keep
myself
regularly
stocked
on
a
college
student
budget
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
drinkability
is
above
average
but
not
great
overall
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
certainly
dont
dislike
it
im
sure
this
would
have
been
more
enjoyable
if
irish
reds
in
general
suited
my
palate
more
but
such
is
life
and
beer
overall
a
good
beer
something
i
would
definitely
buy
again
and
something
everyone
around
me
would
enjoy
d
a
very
solid
irish
red
the
best
ive
had
yet
for
sure
its
tasty
well
rounded
huge
deal
for
me
and
interesting
beer
its
more
complex
than
i
originally
thought
which
is
a
nice
surprise
great
job
sam
adams
bravo
d
another
easy
drinker
from
sam
adams
cant
say
that
i
would
seek
it
out
in
fact
i
prefer
the
boston
lager
to
this
version
there
is
nothing
particularly
complex
or
exciting
about
this
beer
but
also
nothing
offensive
or
bad
tasting
all
around
average
d
pretty
nice
would
drink
again
i
would
buy
again
very
good
for
an
irish
red
ale
much
better
than
smithwicks
not
too
complex
or
anything
so
its
easily
drinkable
a
little
dry
drinkability
quite
good
i
would
gladly
drink
a
few
of
these
d
very
well
balanced
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
some
hints
of
caramel
taste
is
good
caramel
and
malts
fairly
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
d
that
mineral
thing
going
on
in
the
flavor
is
a
bit
offputting
to
me
a
great
red
otherwise
the
feel
is
very
nice
after
one
im
done
though
all
combined
its
a
bit
dry
to
keep
drinking
consistently
still
good
and
wellcrafted
though
d
drinkable
for
those
who
enjoy
sa
beers
and
malty
beers
this
is
a
good
beer
satisfying
though
maybe
not
outstanding
d
taking
me
a
little
while
to
get
through
this
beer
and
not
because
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
let
sit
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
drinkability
id
drink
this
again
especially
since
its
year
round
like
most
irish
reds
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
is
certainly
above
average
but
it
doesnt
take
a
lot
of
risks
that
said
it
probably
wasnt
trying
or
didnt
need
to
this
is
one
of
the
better
irishred
ales
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
tasty
and
enjoyable
if
youre
looking
for
malt
but
i
think
the
sweetness
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
probably
could
only
do
2
of
these
before
the
sweetness
gets
to
me
d
overall
not
the
sa
offering
id
rate
it
well
below
even
killians
would
not
invest
in
a
six
of
this
particular
brew
drinkabilitynot
a
bad
beer
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a

nothing
id
probably
buy
again
cheers
nicely
balanced
very
drinkable
solid
beer
a
good
beer
ive
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
enjoy
the
second
one
in
my
fridge
d
fairly
good
i
would
maybe
have
another
but
wouldnt
buy
a
sixer
again
for
just
myself
maybe
if
it
was
for
a
party
but
then
only
as
a
last
resort
not
bad
for
an
irish
red
enjoyable
enough
yet
nothing
really
makes
this
stand
out
either
d
very
drinkable
for
an
irish
red
this
one
ranks
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
nicely
overall
a
nice
irsh
ale
notes
as
i
said
not
a
real
adventurous
beer
but
a
nicely
crafted
variety
of
flavors
that
could
appeal
to
craft
and
noncraft
drinkers
hop
heads
and
malt
lovers
no
one
will
be
wowed
but
its
a
nice
fall
baseball
evening
beer
it
tastes
good
the
malt
goes
from
toasty
to
bitter
on
the
end
and
after
that
its
kind
of
grassy
and
sweet
tasty
and
full
bodied
and
balanced
a
great
irish
red
d
this
beer
was
great
i
was
really
not
expecting
this
to
be
good
after
listening
to
the
post
after
this
beer
won
the
longshot
competition
but
i
really
liked
this
one
d
these
dont
last
too
long
in
my
house
and
therefore
received
a
perfect
score
in
the
drinkability
category
beer
is
pretty
thick
on
the
tongue
which
is
a
plus
but
that
leafy
flavor
leaves
the
mouth
a
little
puckered
which
isnt
appealing
to
me
a
pretty
tasty
beer
just
what
id
expect
from
sam
adams
this
is
a
very
picturesque
beer
while
it
doesnt
have
an
exceptionally
large
or
longlasting
head
it
is
a
striking
cranberry
red
with
tints
of
plum
and
shades
of
walnut
contrasted
by
an
airy
marzipancolored
head
the
aroma
is
not
so
special
but
not
bad
mostly
caramel
and
honey
with
some
pumpkin
pie
spice
notes
and
a
hop
profile
of
wet
leaves
the
flavor
is
round
and
balanced
mostly
toffee
malt
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
pound
cake
cola
and
an
unexpected
berry
fruitiness
hops
provide
a
firm
leafy
spice
that
bitters
the
beer
nicely
a
lingering
bittersweet
vaguely
herbal
finish
calls
to
mind
a
dry
manhattan
medium
bodied
but
still
dry
this
is
actually
a
very
good
beer
that
makes
for

drinkin
d

that
is

some

some
alcohol
presence
and
waxiness
are
offflavors
decent
feel
medium
body
and
soft
smooth
carbonation
this
is
okay
the
beer
is
fairly
light
on
the
stomach
but
i
find
sweet
beers
to
be
less
than
ideal
as
a
session
brew
mixed
up
with
a
couple
other
beers
maybe
a
porter
and
a
pub
ale
to
change
things
up
and
youve
got
a
good
nightdaymorningwhatever
alone
this
is
probably
limited
in
its
enjoyablility
to
around
3
at
a
time
still
its
extremely
enjoyable
and
i
could
easily
put
away
a
few
of
these
without
complaint
drinkability
it
goes
down
smooth
and
its
not
hard
to
enjoy
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
and
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
prefer
several
other
sam
adams
offerings
to
this
one
though
d
nice
crisp
hoppy
and
malty
irish
red
beer
pretty
interesting
taste
a
little
too
malty
overall
unfortunately
overall
a
bit
off
of
what
would
be
expected
from
this
style
just
average
too
much
carbonation
which
takes
away
from
the
refreshing
nature
of
the
style
also
overly
sweet
taste
balanced
nicely
between
the
sweetness
and
the
slight
bitterness
it
might
have
a
better
taste
if
it
had
a
little
more
bitterness
to
compliment
the
sweet
taste
but
overall
it
has
a
really
nice
flavor
d
goes
down
smooth
but
couldnt
drink
a
lot
because
it
is
a
little
heavy
d
not
what
i
expected
compared
to
other
irish
reds
such
as
kilkenny
and
smithwicks
anyway
but
quite
good
definitely
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
yet
another
solid
entry
from
sam
adams
a
pretty
good
irish
red
i
must
admit
at
5
5
some
people
might
be
caught
off
guard
with
the
medium
body
of
the
beer
worth
a
try
for
sure
d
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
too
filling
this
beer
has
gotten
me
interested
in
the
style
for
some
reason
i
always
thought
irish
reds
were
hoppier
now
im
off
to
try
some
of
the
best
reds
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
came
in
a
sam
adams
variety
pack
thing
pretty
good
irish
red
ale
md
this
sweetness
also
gives
it
a
nice
smoothness
and
quality
mouthfeel
one
of
the
better
sa
beers
i
have
tried
sa
irish
red
is
ok
but
its
not
a
world
beater
in
this
style
or
on
its
own
recommended
to
fans
of
the
style
otherwise
meh
dextremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
d
this
is
just
as
rated
good
i
would
have
another
as
this
is
not
bad
at
all
d
this
is
a
nice
irish
red
overall
i
appreciated
the
flavor
complexities
at
work
here
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
overall
a
wonderful
beer
from
sam
adams
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
the
brewmasters
collection
d
easy
enough
to
get
down
solid
but
not
great
beer
would
definately
drink
it
if
its
around
drinkability
relatively
so
however
it
is
a
bit
sweet
granted
this
is
coming
after
drinking
an
american
wild
ale
so
as
for
sessionability
i
could
have
a
couple
but
that
would
be
about
it
overall
pleasantly
surprised
drinkability
is
good
enough
i
really
am
not
craving
another
since
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
it
is
enjoyable
i
recognize
this
as
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
nice
to
have
in
the
mix
pack
the
next
one
im
saving
for
a
food
pairing
as
i
would
see
this
as
pairing
well
with
a
pork
dish
like
smoked
ham
a
really
nice
beer
nice
and
malty
sweet
with
just
enough
hoppiness
to
provide
some
balance
and
dryness
great
irish
red
ale
many
could
be
enjoyed
and
still
deliver
a
fine
taste
without
overdoing
it
a
great
sam
adams
offering
cheers
drinkability
nice
irish
red
ale
overall
it
is
not
the
most
exciting
style
for
me
but
they
did
a
better
job
than
most
ive
been
trying
to
branch
out
more
in
my
beer
drinking
being
mostly
an
ipa
guy
and
i
think
this
brew
really
turned
me
on
to
irish
reds
its
got
a
great
caramel
smell
and
goes
down
really
smooth
if
it
werent
for
the
sweetness
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
not
that
its
overpowering
or
too
heavy
not
a
beer
that
will
blow
you
away
by
any
means
but
probably
my
favorite
red
because
of
its
simplicity
and
drinkability
would
recommend
it
to
someone
thats
never
had
this
style
before
its
a
good
place
to
start
overall
a
solid
irish
red
ale
worth
getting
when
your
in
the
mood
for
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
d
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
to
drink
many
of
these
but
i
could
have
a
couple
d
i
really
like
this
beer
though
at
5
5
it
might
be
a
little
strong
to
drink
all
night
it
is
certainly
enjoyable
feels
like
a
solid
choice
at
any
time
of
the
year
did
i
mention
i
love
irish
red
i
tried
this
brew
about
a
month
ago
when
i
first
started
drinking
beers
and
the
hops
were
way
above
what
i
could
handle
however
i
am
really
glad
that
i
didnt
pour
this
one
out
because
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
flavor
in
this
brew
i
can
only
imagine
that
this
new
appreciation
of
the
brew
has
come
with
drinking
some
other
beers
that
push
the
limits
a
bit
more
thus
training
my
palate
and
giving
me
some
more
tolerance
in
my
tasting
in
the
end
after
finishing
this
brew
i
am
left
saying
thanks
jim
for
yet
another
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
brew
d
although
this
might
be
too
sweet
for
some
this
could
be
a
solid
session
beer
the
malty
flavors
make
this
a
good
cold
weather
brew
but
its
so
easy
going
down
i
could
drink
this
any
season
of
the
year
a
very
solid
brew
from
sam
adams
d
ehhh
not
the
best
from
sam
adams
if
you
poured
this
for
me
without
me
knowing
id
have
a
hard
time
seperating
this
out
as
an
irish
red
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
brew
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
i
cant
get
over
how
bad
it
was
in
the
glass
what
a
difference
well
worth
the
time
if
tasted
in
the
bottle
release
the
flavors
and
aromas
when
you
pour
and
it
tastes
like
a
malty
red
dog
thats
not
a
good
thing
drinkability
a
surprisingly
wellrounded
tasty
beer
ill
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
good
session
beer
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
poured
a
deep
amber
with
a
medium
pale
head
i
smell
the
amber
malt
maybe
some
earthy
hops
tastes
smooth
with
a
little
malt
sweetness
5
5
abv
was
well
hidden
but
absolutely
felt
the
hops
are
earthy
and
clean
up
the
malt
nicely
not
cloying
very
drinkable
thanks
to
a
dry
finish
kinda
feel
like
this
is
just
an
american
amber
but
with
english
hops
but
what
do
i
know
its
good
would
like
to
try
on
tap
im
liking
the
direction
that
sammy
is
taking
nose
has
some
malt
and
the
taste
is
deep
bready
malt
with
good
sweetness
in
the
middle
dry
at
the
end
hops
are
small
easy
drinker
with
a
nice
heavy
mouthfeel
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
but
ill
take
this
anytime
good
beer
to
have
with
lunch
or
dinner
theres
very
little
body
to
this
beer
the
carbonation
is
strangely
weak
and
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
quite
a
disappointing
beer
d
well
if
the
mouthfeel
review
didnt
emphasize
it
enough
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
can
be
had
many
times
over
for
an
irish
red
though
it
does
the
job
nicely
if
youre
into
these
ales
go
for
it
goes
down
easy
as
a
result
of
its
watery
nature
but
isnt
what
i
would
call
an
above
average
drinker
this
one
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
light
orange
head
smells
of
malt
tastes
of
rich
pungeant
malt
a
bit
of
honey
with
a
hint
of
cranberry
but
not
enough
to
throw
it
off
carbonation
is
just
right
though
the
richness
of
the
flavor
makes
this
one
to
sip
rather
than
drink
quickly
overall
i
just
dont
see
much
difference
in
this
beer
then
a
lot
of
other
sam
adams
beers
so
i
doubt
i
will
buy
this
one
again
i
would
rather
drink
boston
lager
which
has
more
hops
overall
a
decent
beer
that
was
average
at
best
not
something
i
plan
to
seek
out
again
d
nice
and
easy
on
the
palate
could
be
a
session
brew
mouthfeel
is
tame
and
a
little
low
on
the
carbonation
flavor
is
a
huge
malt
bomb
big
tastes
of
molasses
caramel
ginger
bread
toffee
and
caramel
finishes
very
sryupy
with
a
hint
of
bittersweet
on
the
end
not
bad
but
i
wont
seek
this
out
most
likely
too
dang

its

easy

this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
not
something
id
make
a
point
to
seek
out
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
definitely
worth
a
try
d
wouldnt
turn
it
down
at
a
party
but
not
seeking
it
out
again
it
had
a
sour
malt
taste
to
it
that
i
just
wasnt
enjoying
perhaps
it
was
simply
the
batch
mild
fruitiness
to
it
ill
probably
give
it
another
shot
some
other
time
another
fine
outing
by
the
crew
at
sam
adams
i
would
happily
return
to
this
beer
again
red
ales
typically
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
if
more
were
like
this
it
would
surely
grow
on
me
would
pair
nicely
with

colored
it
smells
malty
but
thats
about
all
i
can
pick
up
since
its
so
overwhelming
no
hops
here
this
beer
tastes
better
than
the
smell
but
not
by
much
its
malty
up
front
followed
by
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
definitely
drink
this
beer
cold
as
it
gets
worse
as
ti
warms
however
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
the
carbonation
nice
the
beer
is
a
bit
watery
though
its
a
low
abv
but
the
beer
isnt

drinkable
due
to
the
overpowering
sweetness
definitely
not
the
best
sam
adams
out
there
overall
definitely
not
disappointed
by
this
one
i
would
consider
a
repeat
purchase
if
im
looking
for
am
easy
drinking
red
but
unfortunately
i
only
see
this
one
in
the
mixed
6packs
i
picked
up
mixnmatch
at
dahls
and
threw
a
few
reds
in
he
mix
one
was
sa
irish
red
its
a
pretty
dark
amber
with
a
zesty
aroma
the
taste
is
a
letdown
the
malty
aspect
seems
a
bit
sour
offtasting
the
aftertaste
seems
watereddown
i
ended
up
dumping
the
last
bit
of
the
bottle
im
not
doing
this
one
again
this
is
certainly
no
murphys
my
favorite
red
ale
but
as
usual
sam
adams
offers
a
solid
interpretation
that
will
rarely
disappoint
poured

thanks
to

an
american

with

what
do
i
know
its
good
would
like
to
try
on

amber
colored

with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
caramel
taste
is
maltyfruity
and
a
hint
of
caramel
very
light
and
goes
down
easy
this
is
just
another
good
beer
from
the
people
at
the
boston
beer
company
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
d
is
pretty
spoton
to
this
style
of
beer
a
really
easydrinker
for
me
95
recommended
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
smells
slightly
buttery
and
malty
and
grainy
with
some
slight
cherry
and
peach
to
the
malt
tastes
pretty
typical
for
the
style
with
firm
malt
a
touch
of
butter
and
fruit
and
lightly
hopped
a
bit
tight
and
prickly
in
the
mouth
but
also
fairly
robust
for
the
style
not
bad
d
very
high
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
usual
lackluster
sam
adams
samplers
i
prolly
wont
seek
it
out
again
unless
its
on
sale
pretty
good
everyday
beer
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
that
i
wouldnt
refuse
if
offered
one
and
i
probably
will
give
it
a
try
every
few
months
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
pleases
it
wont
knock
you
socks
off
with
intense
flavors
but
provides
a
relaxing
smooth
experience
this
style
isnt
very
bold
to
begin
with
by
sams
irish
red
is
good
when
you
need
to
reset
from
hop
intense
or
malt
intense
brews
and
just
let
your
taste
buds
relax
for
the
evening
the
aroma
is
outstanding
this
beer
smells
fantastic
look
if
youre
going
to
get
this
beer
or
are
planning
on
picking
it
up
just
take
a
moment
after
purchase
of
course
and
smell
the
st
out
of
this
beer
it
has
floral
notes
on
top
of
malt
that
isnt
overpowered
by
the
golding
hops
aside
from
that
the
beer
is
pretty
average
tastes
more
like
a
porter
than
an
irish
red
nice
depth
though
and
i
like
how
they
approached
this
beer
too
much
of
this
beers
flavor
comes
from
the
overpowering
amount
of
darker
malts
used
in
this
beer
however
it
tastes
too
similar
to
their
honey
porter
to
be
much
in
the
way
of
an
irish
red
ale
its
heavy
but
drinkable
and
it
is
like
velvet
going
down
but
where
is
my
carbonation
this
is
an
ale
not
a
porter
can
someone
please
let
them
know
that
it
is
part
of
the
brewmaster
collection
and
rightfully
so
but
i
really
wanted
an
irish
red
when
i
bought
this
beer
d
i
do
not
have
a
lot
of
exposure
to
irish
red
ales
so
i
am
not
sure
how
it
compares
but
i
would
try
it
again
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
sam
adams
but
it
is
not
bad
not
offensive
but
just
not
what
i
am
looking
for
in
an
irish
red
d
good
session
beer
not
spectacular
but
a
lot
of
times
spectacular
becomes
tiring
when
drinking
more
than
more
so
far
this
is
the
best
irish
red
that
ive
ever
tried
very
enjoyable
and
pretty
well
balanced
even
though
its
over
5
50
abv
this
wouldnt
make
a
bad
session
beer
theres
just
a
bit
of
grapefruitlike
acidity
to
this
that
makes
it
a
bit
harder
to
down
than
it
should
be
but
other
than
that
this
was
relativly
unmemorable
call
me
a
beer
snob
maybe
im
past
the
days
where
a
sam
adams
beer
stood
out
for
me
drinkability
very
easy
and
smooth
for
a
red
ale
pretty
much
on
for
the
style
overall
one
of
the
best
things
to
come
out
of
sam
adams
since
the
seasonals
in
my
oh
so
very
humble
opinion
d
nice
red
ale
very
pleasing
beer
pours
a
clear
reddish
colored
body
with
a
small
white
colored
head
that
is
somewhat
lasting
has
a
malty
and
somewhat
fruity
aroma
but
is
very
weak
a
creamy
watery
taste
malty
and
fruity
has
a
somewhat
fruity
taste
too
watery
drinkability
highly
drinkable
and
a
tasty
session
beer
didnt
blow
me
away
negative
or
postive
a
decent
choice
i
will
visit
again
the
wierd
after
taste
or
metallic
flavor
was
odd
wasnt
terrible
but
not
great
a
clear
red
color
appearance
is
similar
to
other
reds
the
taste
is
very
good
it
is
slightly
dry
the
main
taste
is
malty
with
very
little
taste
of
hops
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
very
light
very
easily
you
could
drink
three
or
four
of
these
the
aroma
is
slightly
complex
it
doesnt
hit
your
nose
with
the
malts
but
it
has
a
pleasant
aroma
this
beer
pours
a
very
nice
red
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
just
wont
quit
even
toward
the
the
bottom
of
the
glass
there
is
still
a
nice
ring
of
lace
leaving
an
enduring
testament
along
the
side
of
my
glass
the
aroma
is
lackluster
but
still
appealing
with
a
nice
bit
of
sweet
caramel
malt
and
an
undertone
of
hops
the
taste
follows
the
route
of
the
nose
not
surprisingly
delivering
on
the
malt
very
nicely
and
almost
balanced
by
the
hops
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
full
body
good
co2
cant
complain
12

in
the

with

and
an

some

high
in
carbonation
with

but
it
is

warm
for
the
style
12
ounce
bottle
taken
from
my
friend
scotts
fridge
tonight
poured
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
a
34
inch
soapy
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
at
first
weak
retention
aroma
is
sweetness
lots
of
malt
black
pepper
light
toffee
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
no
scents
really
stood
out
or
were
very
strong
flavor
does
not
seem
to
have
much
of
a
hop
presence
except
maybe
some
grassy
accents
early
on
mostly
malt
that
is
pretty
sweet
maybe
some
light
fruit
in
there
too
light
and
sweet
mouthfeel
can
be
smooth
at
times
medium
bodied
light
carbonation
could
not
drink
much
more
than
a
bottle
too
sweet
and
malty
overall
needs
bitterness
to
battle
it
out
probably
would
skip
next
time
might
be
worth
trying
taste
the
flavor
is
led
by
sweet
malts
and
light
hops
but
it
finishes
crisp
but
dry
overall
a
pretty
good
experience
overall
you
can
put
these
back
a
tad
bit
sweeter
than
expected
but
that
is
ok
i
dug
it
it
is
important
to
remember
that
this
one
is
not
a
onetrick
pony
lots
of
changes
from
first
sip
to
the
finish
decent
and
worthy
of
a
try
d
nothing
overpowering
here
good
session
beer
as
a
fan
of
all
beers
irish
red
i
have
been
awaiting
the
arrival
of
sam
adams
product
and
i
was
not
disappointed
although
the
heavy
somewhat
yeasty
aftertaste
took
me
by
surprize
at
first
i
grew
to
enjoy
it
without
it
i
suspect
the
beer
would
have
been
too
much
like
a
smithwicks
it
has
the
color
i
like
a
deep
amber
with
enough
head
upon
pouring
to
tickle
my
stache
a
fine
addition
to
my
collection
conclusion
simple
to
the
point
and
nicely
balanced
just
how
i
like
my
irish
reds
this
is
a
beer
that
has
a
very
simple
taste
the
bitterness
is
balanced
with
a
nice
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
well
and
has
the
night
amount
of
body
for
an
irish
red
ale
d
this
is
a
great
fall
beer
and
an
excellent
session
beer
a
great
one
when
youre
kicking
back
enjoying
that
lateseason
weather
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
irish
reds
a
malty
backbone
is
complimented
by
a
background
hoppiness
ive
never
seen
sixpacks
of
this
around
my
area
but
would
buy
more
often
if
i
did
very
enjoyable
very
nice
head
and
lacing
with
a
pleasing
caramel
red
color
smell
is
malt
malt
and
more
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
hops
taste
has
malt
sweetness
but
not
cloying
some
hop
undertones
just
enough
dryness
for
balance
mouthfeel
is
a
good
balance
of
smoothness
with
a
hint
of
dryness
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
not
a
session
brew
but
a
couple
go
down
quite
nicely
not
my
style
but
decent
considering
i
will
buy
again
d
very
drinkably
but
i
like
this
style
of
beer
and
i
also
like
all
sam
adams
beer
that
i
have
had
the
chance
to
drink
ill
be
adding
it
to
my
list
of
beers
served
at
my
annual
st
patricks
day
party
pours
a
clear
amber
color
14
inch
head
with
slight
retention
and
little
to
no
lacing
smells
slightly
of
hops
and
malt
fits
the
style
smooth
crisp
good
carbonation
the
hops
bitterness
is
noticed
first
and
stays
relatively
strong
throughout
a
good
malt
background
is
present
its
not
too
sweet
which
i
like
a
good
strong
malt
characteristic
and
nice
bitter
note
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
i
could
see
this
being
a
session
beer
for
those
that
like
irish
reds
but
i
will
not
be
searching
for
this
i
like
sam
adams
but
believe
they
have
better
offerings
good
flavor
and
nice
atmosphere
slightly
complex
nose
good
feel
nice
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
sweet
very
nice
overall
quaff
definitely
worth
buying
the
brewmasters
pack
or
whatever
it
came
in
to
try
this
3
25
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
from
a
very
solid
brewery
i
think
sam
makes
good
reliable
beers
but
nothing
that
really
blows
my
socks
off
except
boston
lager
which
is
my
comfort
beer
still
if
youre
an
irish
red
fan
im
sure
youll
enjoy
this
one
and
since
its
a
sam
its
probably
widely
available
presntation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
would
i
drink
again
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
regularly
i
didnt
give
it
a
perfect
5
but
it
was
very
close
i
am
very
picky
choosing
my
beers
to
begin
with
and
i
just
grabbed
another
good
one
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
a
nice
and
smooth
beer
taste
very
smooth
and
drinkable
its
malty
with
the
hops
in
the
background
to
me
this
tastes
like
an
english
pale
ale
d
this
one
is
tasty
and
unlike
many
other
sa
offerings
it
drinks
a
little
heavier
than
it
actually
is
decent
complexity
and
somewhat
robust
while
remaining
quite
quaffable
a
nice
american
version
of
a
classic
beer
style
drinkability
overall
a
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
but
nothing
truly
outstanding
a
bit
too
maltheavy
though
drinkability
not
terrible
but
not
great
either
i
think
sam
adams
is
reputable
for
brewing
a
wide
selection
of
beers
none
of
which
are
terrible
but
none
of
which
really
stand
out
either
this
one
might
be
a
good
introduction
for
someone
whose
never
had
an
irish
red
before
or
someone
whos
not
used
to
good
beer
drinkability
is
moderate
its
not
completely
offensive
just
missing
the
mark
on
most
aspects
i
can
feel
the
alcohol
on
the
middle
of
my
palate
some
bubbles
towards
the
back
a
touch
of
bitterness
average
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
couldnt
have
more
than
two
would
want
more
that
two
d
highly
drinkable
i
would
definitely
like
to
have
this
brew
again
i
have
yet
to
see
it
by
itself
in
six
pack
this
was
purchased
in
a
brewmaster
pack
along
with
the
honey
porter
and
black
lager
probably
one
of
the
better
reds
around
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
keep
on
hand
d
a
nice
irish
red
i
had
three
of
these
in
one
night
and
i
could
of
kept
drinking
them
not
my
favourite
style
but
a
nicely
brewed
example
worth
trying
i
pick
up
a
6pack
of
this
from
timetotime
so
for
the
price
and
availability
it
is
worth
having
again
im
curious
why
this
isnt
more
readily
available
as
i
feel
it
would
surely
give
sales
of
smithwicks
a
run
for
its
money
especially
for
the
style
this
one
is
complex
and
layered
im
not
head
over
heels
for
it
but
id
look
for
it
again
it
has
dark
brownish
red
body
it
has
a
caramel
tan
head
with
a
little
bit
of
lace
the
lace
is
tight
it
has
a
roasted
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
a
little
most
complex
than
most
reds
it
has
a
deep
roasted
malt
and
nut
like
taste
with
some
bitterness
the
after
taste
has
a
grainy
plant
like
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
slightly
fizzy
some
styles
just
dont
work
to
well
with
european
hops
in
my
opinion
sam
adams
is
a
hell
of
a
brewer
and
they
can
always
been
counted
on
to
deliver
beers
that
are
worth
drinking
and
at
least
a
little
interesting
but
this
once
just
aint
all
that
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
spot
on
fixing
to
open
up
another
with
a
good
book
pours
an
amber
red
color
with
a
small
dense
tan
colored
head
that
settled
into
a
light
cap
the
aroma
faint
and
is
of
light
caramel
malt
slightly
buttery
the
taste
is
of
sweet
caramel
malt
some
honey
and
a
dry
bitter
tea
like
hop
the
brew
has
a
moderate
body
with
semisoft
carbonation
astringent
finishes
with
a
lemony
bitterness
a
decent
irish
red
though
it
is
a
bit
hard
to
review
since
i
am
not
a
real
fan
of
the
style
seems
to
be
true
to
the
style
d
true
to
the
style
this
is
made
for
session
drinking
competitively
priced
could
go
with
this
easily
if
there
is
no
smithwicks
available
overall
a
nicely
drinkable
irish
red
it
certainly
separates
itself
from
an
american
amber
with
less
citrusy
hops
and
more
tea
like
hop
characteristics
the
caramel
is
also
quite
prevalent
with
a
bit
of
toast
great
beer
for
the
price
and
accessibility
great
beer
in
general
shorttop
but
stubborn
head
amber
of
course
aroma
is
big
and
forwardthe
caramel
and
toffee
and
brown
sugar
candies
im
not
sure
i
can
distinguish
this
from
a
typical
scotch
ale
though
tastes
exactly
like
it
smells
likewise
bears
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
because
the
carbonation
lasts
and
so
nicely
cleans
the
palate
you
never
feel
too
gooey
or
heavy
if
the
label
were
masked
i
would
definitely
feelby
the
overall
weightiness
of
the
beer
taste
aroma
feelthat
this
were
a
true
microbrew
brew
rather
than
sam
adams
not
a
session
beer
needs
your
attention
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
havent
had
this
style
before
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
sam
adams
and
will
revisit
this
one
fore
sure
dquite
drinkable
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
ill
certainly
have
this
one
again
especially
considering
theres
another
in
the
fridge
d
i
could
take
six
of
these
quite
nicely
over
a
game
of
cards
me
proud
of
that
sammy
aint
he
sam
and
marys
boy
old
deacon
raised
that
boy
right
a
very
nice
offering
and
one
of
the
better
irish
reds
that
i
have
had
i
bought
a
single
of
this
and
now
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
sixer
slainte
d
it
took
me
a
few
of
these
to
appreciate
them
at
first
it
just
seemed
like
a
highly
drinkable
beer
with
little
flavor
but
it
has
been
growing
on
me
this
favor
is
quite
complex
and
pleasant
and
yet
isnt
an
assault
to
the
taste
buds
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
a
great
deal
at
7
50
a
six
on
sale
plan
on
purchasing
again
perfect
fall
beer
that
reminds
me
of
drinking
apple
cider
full
of
spice
and
oranges
during
the
holidays
oustanding
irish
ale
deep
redish
hue
is
topped
off
with
a
long
lasting
vanilla
head
with
plenty
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
caramel
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
fragerent
hops
the
taste
is
big
mainly
caramel
toffey
with
a
smooth
finish
that
dries
a
bit
towards
the
end
a
very
nice
session
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
alcohol
one
of
sas
best
seasonal
ales
d
one
of
the
better
red
ales
with
mass
appeal
this
one
was
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
a
good
choice
to
have
with
food
when
you
dont
want
the
beer
flavors
fighting
with
the
food
flavors
drinkability
easily
alot
more
drinkable
then
alot
of
other
red
ales
i
can
easily
sesh
a
6
pack
of
these
very
drinkable
without
having
a
boring
taste
boston
beer
company
does
it
again
good
work
drinkability
is
good
pitchers
of
this
stuff
would
be
welcome
at
a
session
good
take
on
a
fairly
basic
style
d
drinks
well
but
too
sweet
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
smells
like
carmel
pretty
strong
actually
pours
with
a
very
nice
head
also
tastes
very
sweet
not
bitter
at
all
slight
hint
of
that
same
carmel
again
its
as
if
some
one
finally
managed
to
make
a
beer
malt
well
kinda
its
not
that
creamy
but
it
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
s
t
good
greeting
of
hop
with
undertone
of
malt
there
is
a
good
after
taste
of
hop
nothing
that
really
excites
the
palate
for
desire
to
drink
this
beer
on
regular
basis
d
when
i
think
of
irish
red
i
think
of
killians
i
didnt
think
i
would
like
this
as
much
as
i
do
color
me
surprised
i
knew
it
would
be
at
least
competent
but
i
didnt
expect
to
get
into
it
this
much
if
i
wasnt
already
full
i
could
drink
a
couple
it
comes
out
of
the
bottle
an
appetizing
clear
mahogany
brown
rather
a
dark
coppery
color
with
a
respectable
but
not
persistent
head
aroma
is
malty
with
hints
of
spice
hops
and
treacle
flavor
is
mouthfilling
and
has
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
bitterness
is
minimal
and
nicely
complements
the
subtle
sweetness
there
is
also
a
touch
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
and
tingly
enjoy
not
the
best
irish
red
ale
ive
had
but
its
pretty
good
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
red
color
and
it
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
i
retried
this
beer
after
not
liking
it
so
well
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
must
have
had
bad
patch
the
first
time
because
this
time
the
beer
is
pretty
good
nice
and
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
very
nice
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
night
since
they
go
down
smooth
overalla
good
beer
a
superior
alternative
to
killians
ive
havent
had
too
many
reds
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
usually
dont
like
reds
or
irish
reds
so
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
seems
like
the
little
brother
to
the
scotch
ale
similar
flavors
but
not
as
much
of
them
still
pretty
good
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
deep
burnt
umber
color
with
a
tan
onefinger
head
retention
and
lacing
are
average
sweet
aroma
mostly
caramel
with
some
honey
flavor
is
toasty
and
grainy
with
some
caramel
sweetness
and
an
appreciable
earthy
metallic
hop
finish
with
light
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
finish
is
mostly
clean
a
decent
and
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
american
interpretation
of
the
style
a
better
pick
than
murphys
red
or
a
smithwicks
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
nice
looking
brew
a
dark
reddish
orange
color
with
an
extremely
creamy
off
white
head
which
sticks
around
the
nose
is
sweet
and
slightly
smoky
malt
forward
with
faint
hops
the
taste
is
the
weakest
component
of
this
beer
it
is
mirrors
the
nose
sweet
malts
with
some
smokiness
well
balanced
but
nothing
blows
me
away
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
dry
it
would
make
a
decent
session
brew
d
this
is
a
good
solid
irish
red
good
from
first
sip
to
last
as
usual
sam
adams
delivers
tried
this
beer
out
of
a
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
nice
reddish
brown
color
good
malty
smell
with
light
hops
light
tan
head
that
laces
lightly
down
the
glass
earthy
hops
flavor
comes
through
the
sweet
caramel
of
the
malt
decent
balance
of
flavors
light
cream
feel
in
the
mouth
with
pronounced
carbonation
somewhat
above
average
on
the
drinkability
scale
overall
a
very
decent
beer
ciao
usually
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
must
say
tried
it
when
it
came
out
last
year
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
pours
a
very
nice
red
color
and
tastes
very
malty
and
has
a
caramel
kick
to
it
only
was
able
to
try
2
in
the
mixed
pack
but
ill
have
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
it
and
try
it
our
again
drinkablity
good
change
of
pace
well
crafted
i
would
like
to
see
samuel
adams
increase
the
availability
of
these
brews
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
middleoftheroad
beer
for
sam
adams
but
worth
drinking
if
you
have
not
tried
it
this
brew
poured
a
hazy
dark
copper
color
the
best
by
date
showed
that
i
still
had
about
a
week
before
this
one
was
past
its
prime
but
there
were
still
some
floaters
in
the
glass
when
i
held
it
up
to
the
light
the
smell
was
delicious
caramel
malts
as
advertised
on
the
bottle
the
first
few
sips
were
great
maybe
some
toasted
malts
and
there
was
a
balance
between
the
hops
and
malts
but
then
it
all
fell
a
part
for
some
reason
and
the
last
80
of
this
beer
was
just
ok
i
will
have
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
soon
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
glass
i
was
enjoyable
drinkability
not
bad
but
definitely
not
great
and
much
weaker
than
most
sam
adams
beers
ive
enjoyed
alcohol
levels
fine
but
its
just
not
interesting
or
complex
enough
to
keep
my
attention
for
too
long
worth
a
try
but
not
something
id
seek
out
or
drink
again
unless
it
comes
in
a
mix
pack
which
it
does
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
irish
red
although
i
have
not
had
a
lot
of
irish
reds
this
seems
like
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
i
really
would
recommend
it
i
glanced
at
the
presentation
on
the
first
pour
and
rushed
through
the
scent
to
taste
it
on
my
first
two
bottles
but
on
the
third
i
slowed
enough
to
write
this
review
every
sip
i
took
i
was
almost
convinced
that
ive
found
my
favorite
beer
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
mainstream
irish
red
killians
and
i
knew
that
id
have
to
find
another
irish
red
when
i
got
into
actually
caring
about
the
beer
i
was
drinking
i
know
there
are
others
out
there
and
im
hoping
they
can
beat
this
one
but
wow
this
is
a
great
irish
red
try
this
sam
for
sure
its
way
better
than
their
octoberfest
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
simplicity
of
this
brew
i
love
samuel
adams
line
for
start
up
styles
im
now
curious
to
try
more
irish
red
ales
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
sam
adams
glass
the
genetically
engineered
one
it
was
a
very
clear
amberred
color
with
a
robust
tan
colored
head
there
might
even
be
some
light
lacing
with
this
brew
the
aroma
is
strong
of
caramel
there
are
some
roasted
nut
fragrances
noticeable
as
well
very
inviting
the
beer
is
initially
big
with
malt
but
not
overpowering
it
ends
bitter
roasted
and
a
touch
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
noticeable
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
session
brew
from
sam
adams
but
it
seems
hard
to
get
in
my
area
of
the
country
only
available
in
sampler
packs
a
pretty
good
irish
red
but
not
my
favorite
beats
killians
thats
for
sure
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
at
least
there
was
some
flavor
to
this
beer
to
keep
you
going
as
for
me
ive
had
enough
of
this
beer
already
another
strong
sam
adams
drinkability
no
thanks
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
one
again
d
another
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
after
having
a
lot
of
mediocre
brews
lately
im
beginning
to
realise
just
how
good
the
bbc
is
quaffable
tasty
ale
right
here
i
put
off
buying
this
because
the
few
offerings
of
the
style
didnt
impress
me
this
is
really
nice
d
despite
the
rather
odd
tastes
that
i
was
getting
out
of
this
i
would
still
say
that
it
is
beter
than
average
drinkability
drinkability
not
a
huge
fan
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
alkaloid
bitterness
will
avoid
in
the
future
notes
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
simple
pleasing
flavor
very
pleasant
beer
and
a
good
session
beer
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
cherry
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
sweet
malty
aroma
some
caramel
too
the
taste
was
more
caramel
but
the
fruitiness
was
there
too
drying
hops
finish
will
have
it
again
pretty
typical
for
the
style
but
the
aftertaste
kills
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
as
a
session
beer
this
would
definitely
rank
high
on
my
list
a
very
balanced
brew
and
quite
attractive
as
well
i
first
tracked
this
brew
down
as
a
single
on
the
huge
wall
of
beer
at
jungle
jims
in
fairfield
oh
ill
tell
ya
i
was
surprised
i
could
not
find
this
anywhere
and
it
was
st
patrick
season
i
was
impressed
then
but
could
not
find
it
in
a
six
pack
until
just
recently
at
kroger
of
all
places
this
beer
is
tricky
it
is
a
lot
like
the
infamous
mullet
hair
style
from
the
80s
this
beer
is
all
business
in
the
front
and
all
party
in
the
rear
the
hops
are
heavily
frontloaded
it
is
kinda
hard
to
get
used
to
after
the
hops
subside
you
get
subtle
maltiness
and
a
refreshing
finish
that
is
heathledgerjoker
lipsmacking
good
well
done
sam
adams
bottle
poured
a
deep
caramel
color
ale
with
a
huge
light
brown
color
head
with
some
good
retention
but
minimal
lacing
aroma
consists
of
strong
caramel
malt
with
some
nice
touch
of
toffee
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
deep
rich
and
somewhat
sweet
caramel
malt
notes
with
some
nice
touch
of
toffee
which
were
not
expected
but
well
enjoyed
fuller
body
then
expected
with
some
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
body
is
lot
more
creamy
then
expected
and
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
more
then
i
had
expected
theres
layered
flavors
that
just
dont
seem
to
work
well
together
somethings
off
with
this
one
i
will
not
buy
again
d
i
would
have
it
in
a
bar
if
offered
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
decent
offering
in
general
d
i
highly
recommend
and
one
of
the
better
ones
coming
out
of
boston
beer
company
fairly
drinkable
not
a
bad
offering
by
sam
adams
overallim
a
little
let
down
by
this
offering
from
sam
adams
i
thought
they
would
nail
this
style
but
it
appears
they
missed
the
mark
too
malty
thick
and
an
off
sweetness
that
isnt
pleasent
d
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
its
pretty
heavy
and
not
in
a
particularly
drinkable
way
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
pretty
thick
like
cough
syrup
but
a
nice
drinkable
beer
notes
good
for
the
style
and
a
simplewell
balanced
beer
high
marks
for
drinkability
here
great
example
of
an
irish
red
nothing
mindblowing
about
it
but
balanced
and
tasty
good
brew
just
not
big
enough
for
my
likings
appreciate
the
brew
none
the
less
doesnt
feel
insubstantial
in
the
mouth
reasonable
carbonation
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
worth
the
price
paid
and
worth
drinking
again
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
copper
color
with
a
generous
threefinger
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malt
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
toasty
maltiness
little
bit
of
hop
bite
that
fades
away
to
some
sweet
caramel
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
thick
without
an
overbearing
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
although
its
a
little
rich
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
i
could
enjoy
more
than
a
couple
in
a
night
this
pours
from
the
bottle
to
immediately
form
a
nice
head
which
dissipates
rather
quickly
but
continues
to
renew
itself
around
the
miniscus
as
the
hefty
carbonation
continues
to
work
its
magic
the
deep
red
color
is
unusual
for
an
irishstyle
ale
having
an
almost
burgundy
hue
the
rich
sweet
malty
aroma
is
quite
lovely
and
leads
well
into
the
sweet
caramel
maltiness
on
the
palate
the
texture
is
thick
for
an
irish
red
and
coats
the
tongue
to
deliver
a
nice
finish
of
malt
with
subtle
hop
bitterness
overall
a
very
nice
specialty
beer
but
not
as
drinkable
as
the
boston
lager
sam
adams
irish
red
poured
a
very
nice
dark
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
pretty
good
lacing
smelled
of
sweat
malt
but
wasnt
very
strong
taste
was
malty
sweet
crisp
refreshing
and
a
slight
hop
bite
mouthfeel
was
good
drinkability
was
nice
as
well
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
good
for
the
style
this
is
a
nice
looking
beer
it
has
a
light
tan
head
about
a
finger
thick
and
is
very
dense
and
it
completely
covers
a
slightly
hazy
red
amber
body
with
some
medium
carbonation
the
head
thins
out
and
has
some
good
lacing
to
it
it
has
a
nice
hop
scent
to
it
a
little
floral
sweetness
and
hint
of
brown
sugar
it
has
a
semicrisp
feel
and
taste
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
and
has
a
mediumtolight
body
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
it
is
smooth
and
mildly
sweet
throughout
there
is
also
a
mild
bitterness
to
it
and
it
has
a
faint
dry
finish
to
it
drinkable
and
sessionable
but
again
nothing
that
stands
out
for
me
pours
into
my
sam
adams
glass
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
large
offwhite
head
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
and
side
aroma
is
dark
caramel
with
some
floral
hops
taste
is
very
toasty
with
lots
of
caramel
not
much
sweetness
finishes
dry
plenty
of
herbal
hops
with
a
lingering
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
fairly
drinkable
but
not
something
id
be
inclined
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
think
this
is
probably
a
good
example
of
the
style
which
admittedly
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
drinkability
quite
nice
dark
red
rich
appearance
with
a
thick
dense
head
i
cant
pick
up
very
much
smell
on
this
beer
i
detect
a
faint
carmel
apple
scent
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
scent
maybe
somethings
wrong
with
my
nose
i
can
definitely
taste
way
more
than
i
can
smell
its
a
sweet
carmel
and
roasted
malt
flavor
and
the
texture
is
great
it
creamy
like
a
milk
stout
the
best
irish
red
style
beer
ive
ever
had
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
even
with
a
style
i
dont
like
it
seems
quite
a
bit
was
accomplished
in
making
a
bold
strong
beer
i
taste
brazil
nuts
and
minerals
hops
are
present
but
slide
in
on
the
backside
not
a
bad
brew
fairly
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
a
whole
sixer
of
these
drinkability
is
decent
this
is
a
pretty
big
beer
for
the
low
price
tag
very
enjoyable
as
a
session
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
sam
seasonals
d
despite
the
strong
malt
character
the
beer
isnt
heavy
i
could
drink
many
of
these
i
really
like
this
beer
sa
gets
a
lot
of
flack
as
of
late
and
especially
for
their
newer
brews
but
i
really
dig
this
particular
one
no
its
not
great
but
its
a
really
solid
brew
that
is
widely
available
and
not
overpriced
d
could
be
sessionable
smooth
and
pretty
good
drinkability
i
really
liked
this
one
would
have
been
an
a
if
the
smell
was
a
little
more
interesting
but
i
guess
that
goes
with
the
style
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
highly
sessionable
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
offerings
overall
this
was
a
good
irish
red
buti
dont
think
that
i
will
buy
it
again
this
is
a
great
balancing
act
of
a
beer
here
it
has
a
heartiness
that
really
satisfies
nice
creaminess
not
watery
this
is
a
solid
beer
i
loved
it
samuel
adams
irish
red
is
a
prototypical
irish
red
ale
that
is
very
very
close
to
being
good
beer
hell
it
is
good
beer
but
i
cant
quite
pull
the
trigger
on
the
next
highest
flavor
score
i
will
definitely
be
coming
back
to
this
one
in
the
future
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
poured
into
a
boston
lager
glass
a
nice
crisp
light
copper
with
a
decent
frothy
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
great
lacing
aroma
was
slight
caramel
malts
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
a
nice
amount
of
caramel
malt
with
pine
hops
lingering
in
the
background
and
coming
through
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
light
smooth
and
crisp
with
decent
carbonation
i
must
say
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
however
if
in
the
mood
for
the
style
id
more
than
likely
just
go
with
harpoon
or
murphys
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
dating
notch
on
the
side
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
nice
rich
ruby
color
there
was
a
lot
of
suspended
yeast
in
there
and
a
little
carb
as
well
it
had
a
small
offwhite
head
that
quickly
settled
into
a
thin
collar
just
a
hint
of
lacing
the
smell
was
heavily
sweet
malt
with
caramel
overtones
i
almost
found
it
to
be
too
sweet
almost
distracting
which
had
me
worried
about
the
taste
being
too
sweet
it
wasnt
it
was
a
solid
irish
red
ale
its
not
my
favorite
style
although
i
do
like
to
detour
here
once
in
awhile
to
get
away
from
the
hop
bombs
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
but
probably
wont
be
buying
many
sixers
of
it
d
a
great
beer
aside
from
the
growing
bitterness
in
the
finish
reminded
me
of
what
i
always
thought
killians
should
be
but
the
bitterness
in
the
end
is
a
bit
much
for
the
style
that
said
its
a
bit
darker
in
color
than
killians
or
killarneys
but
probably
right
on
for
smithwicks
it
has
a
creamy
yellowed
tan
head
that
indicates
were
talking
about
an
allmalt
beer
some
of
the
previously
mentioned
brands
utilize

i
couldnt
see
passing
this
up
for
smithwicks
and
its
much
better
than
killarneys
very
enjoyable
a
nice
addition
to
the
samuel
adams
lineup
this
was
a
beer
which
was
enjoyable
and
gave
good
bang
for
the
buck
it
was
on
sale
for
under
7
a
six
pack
and
came
with
a
nice
sam
adams
glass
to
boot
this
is
another
very
impressive
brew
from
the
folks
at
sam
adams
im
certainly
going
to
have
this
beer
again
and
i
look
forward
to
it
anyone
liking
a
good
irish
red
will
without
a
doubt
be
pleased
with
this
brew
d
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
beer
as
with
most
sam
adams
offerings
it
isnt
particularly
creative
or
over
the
top
but
it
is
solid
and
reliable
id
definitely
drink
it
again
very
drinkable
with
anything
and
refreshing
pours
out
darker
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
has
a
pretty
good
smell
of
low
key
hops
the
smell
and
taste
all
remind
me
of
a
brown
ale
id
like
it
to
be
a
little
bit
more
distinct
its
good
and
easy
to
drink
with
or
without
food
but
it
just
doesnt
have
any
unique
characteristic
to
it
an
intersting
version
of
the
style
which
has
aspects
of
a
malty
lager
with
a
pinch
of
ale
pours
a
nice
deep
red
color
with
a
thick
offwhite
almost
reddish
head
that
is
a
little
lumpy
the
head
thins
but
remains
around
14
for
quite
a
while
nice
sweet
malty
aroma
with
maybe
a
hint
of
floral
hops
pleasant
caramel
malty
initial
flavor
that
has
a
delayed
transition
to
a
more
earthy
malt
aftertaste
and
a
lingering
mild
bitterness
a
llittle
bit
sweet
but
still
nice
medium
bodied
and
maybe
just
a
little
syruppy
with
active
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
bet
and
worth
trying
d
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
long
very
sessionable
great
taste
worth
getting
12
oz
bottle
a
nice
caramel
malt
up
front
in
the
aroma
with
definite
grassy
hop
characteristics
intermingled
with
a
sweetness
that
is
pleasing
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
medium
long
lasting
off
white
head
taste
is
got
a
definite
herbal
hop
characteristic
malt
is
on
the
back
end
an
interesting
brew
i
am
kind
of
torn
with
this
one
its
nice
and
interesting
but
the
aftertaste
is
watery
overall
i
think
its
alright
interesting
indeed
and
rather
strange
on
my
palate
right
now
to
give
it
anything
but
an
average
rating
d
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
weekend
long
overall
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
i
could
easily
session
this
one
all
night
at
home
or
in
the
pub
a
solid
brew
all
around
overall
one
of
the
best
irish
ales
ive
tasted
boston
beer
co
s
hit
this
one
on
the
head
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
snappy
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
a
nice
session
beer
without
skimping
on
the
flavor
pours
a
light
brown
red
colour
pours
with
a
medium
head
has
a
very
interesting
and
pleasing
taste
some
caramel
and
toffee
mixed
with
some
nice
irish
craick
irish
for
good
fun
is
a
good
brew
that
i
bet
would
craick
it
up
on
tap
the
sole
survivor
of
the
six
pack
break
at
specs
final
thought
samuel
adams
brewed
one
of
their
best
beers
and
provides
a
great
irish
red
ale
model
to
follow
even
if
they
skimp
on
quantity
of
ingredients
comparably
cheers
smooth
and
softly
carbonated
excellent
drinkability
overall
a
delicious
if
not
exceptional
beer
as
i
said
above
without
this
my
choices
would
have
been
far
worse
thanks
again
sam
adams
overall
this
is
a
malty
beer
that
does
not
go
extreme
in
any
way
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
not
bad
nothing
exceptional
but
great
drinkability
worth
a
try
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
even
carbonation
very
satisfying
feel
decent
beer
fairly
drinkable
its
definitely
good
to
try
a
new
one
from
sa
i
have
unfortunately
not
had
many
others
of
the
style
but
this
certainly
made
a
good
impression
on
me
not
too
bad
for
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
this
one
once
or
twice
very
interesting
take
its
more
hoppy
than
most
reds
but
i
prefer
that
one
thing
though
is
that
it
isnt
a
session
beer
its
taken
me
an
hour
just
to
get
through
two
so
it
isnt
something
you
want
to
get
for
a
st
patties
party
or
something
like
that
pours
a
nice
almost
ruby
red
from
a
12oz
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
2
finger
head
not
a
lot
of
lacing
smells
about
how
i
thought
it
would
bit
of
malt
smell
some
faint
hops
maybe
a
metallic
smell
in
there
too
taste
is
really
good
kind
of
a
malty
decently
bodied
ale
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
malt
but
in
no
way
really
sweet
almost
a
cherry
taste
in
there
mouthfeel
is
nice
sits
real
nice
on
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
easy
to
drink
you
know
i
hate
a
lot
of
sam
adams
beers
and
i
dont
know
a
lot
about
irish
red
ales
but
i
really
like
this
beer
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
irish
red
lagers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
poured
a
dark
amberred
color
with
good
head
and
decent
lacing
smells
and
tastes
malty
and
with
a
slight
bitter
hoppiness
at
the
end
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
not
overly
exciting
one
of
sam
adams
more
mediocre
brews
from
their
brewmaster
collection
better
than
killians
at
least
a
clear
amber
color
that
has
a
mediocre
tan
head
th
nose
has
some
caramel
and
sweet
fruit
followed
by
a
small
amount
of
hops
the
taste
is
mostly
malts
but
has
some
bitter
hop
flavors
a
light
to
medium
body
has
average
carbonation
a
good
brew
to
wash
down
a
burger
d
pretty
easy
drinker
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
had
this
on
a
brewery
tour
a
little
over
a
year
ago
when
they
were
still
tweaking
it
and
enjoyed
it
more
then
when
it
was
much
less
sweet
bodywise
it
starts
off
close
to
medium
but
it
thins
out
a
bit
just
before
the
swallow
and
it
finishes
with
a
mix
of
bread
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
i
really
like
this
one
and
i
find
it
very
easy
to
drink
well
done
bbc
btw
the
best
by
date
notch
is
november

super
fresh
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
very
tastey
wish
i
had
some
more
lots
of
flavor
in
this
one
looks
surprisingly
perfect
excellent
lacing
from
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
and
a
pretty
deep
amber
color
looks
pretty
perfect
nose
is
toffee
malt
deep
and
mildly
spicy
dried
fruit
no
real
hop
presence
flavor
is
fairly
similar
although
theres
a
slight
graininess
in
there
along
with
the
toffee
malt
slight
hint
of
bitter
coffee
in
the
fruit
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
that
works
well
with
the
spiciness
overall
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
highly
drinkable
really
smooth
and
a
very
sessionable
brew
which
bbc
really
seems
to
excel
at
a
quite
good
red
ale
quite
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
poured
an
attracted
red
color
with
decent
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
spicy
with
hints
of
caramel
sweetness
the
flavor
is
also
of
caramel
and
roasted
maltiness
that
is
balanced
by
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
effort
and
also
highly
drinkable
poured
to
a
nice
head
head
disapated
quicker
than
other
s
a
beers
that
i
have
had
lacing
was
above
normal
ale
was
reddish
brown
smelled
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
also
a
hint
of
alcohol
and
malt
tasted
slightly
bitter
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
perhaps
the
stronger
alcohol
content
felt
good
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
just
about
right
i
would
be
carefull
making
these
an
all
nighter
the
higher
alcohol
content
was
evident
i
dont
think
this
ale
was
as
good
as
some
of
s
a
products
but
it
was
by
no
means
a
bad
product
all
in
all
a
very
smooth
refreshing
irish
red
one
of
the
best
ive
had
now
if
only
they
could
make
more
of
this
quality
on
the
isle
itself
sam
has
trouble
brewing
a
bad
beer
except
that
cherry
lambic
ugh
this
one
is
very
good
as
well
redtinted
amber
with
a
lacy
head
smells
of
honey
spring
and
moss
hearty
hoppy
bite
well
balanced
by
sweet
malt
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
crisp
finish
and
little
aftertaste
very
drinkable
im
not
a
red
fan
but
this
one
is
very
good
bottle
pours
a
clear
copper
body
with
a
small
beige
head
that
strews
some
respectable
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
toasted
caramel
red
apple
skins
and
spicy
hops
light
medium
body
is
moderately
carbonated
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
with
toasted
caramel
malt
and
a
bittering
spicy
hop
profile
some
earthiness
is
also
noted
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
pleasantly
drinkable
i
would
recommend
this
beer
this
beer
thinned
out
a
little
over
time
but
i
could
still
sit
down
and
have
two
or
three
in
a
session
without
complaint
overall
a
flavorful
and
complex
ale
scarlet
red
body
thin
and
slightly
bubbly
beige
head
leaves
some
pretty
decent
lace
along
the
way
pretty
strong
aroma
of
toasted
malts
and
spicy
hops
flavor
brings
more
of
the
same
really
decent
effort
at
an
irish
red
sweet
caramel
with
some
light
toasted
bread
notes
and
a
sweet
lingering
flavor
hops
add
just
a
touch
of
dryness
easy
going
feel
on
the
palate
and
quite
drinkable
solid
d
definitely
sessionableits
got
a
medium
body
and
an
intriguing
flavor
that
keeps
me
interested
i
wish
i
could
find
it
in
sixpacks
here
this
one
was
only
in
a
sampler
6
pack
with
2
honey
porters
and
2
black
lagers
the
thing
that
really
stood
out
to
me
about
this
beer
besides
the
red
color
was
the
earthy
hoppy
aftertaste
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
possible
session
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
down
flavor
is
smooth
and
enjoyable
there
are
certainly
more
aggressive
scotch
ales
out
there
this
one
has
a
milder
flavor
profile
that
makes
a
nice
easy
drinking
session
brew
d
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
six
pack
overall
a
solid
beer
good
for
something
different
apours
a
deep
amber
with
about
a
75
head
that
disipated
over
5
min
without
much
lacing
it
smells
slightly
sweet
and
malty
it
has
a
strong
malt
taste
with
slight
earthen
tones
that
i
would
associate
with
a
bock
very
faint
earthy
taste
though
with
some
molassas
or
caramel
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
i
had
this
out
of
our
refridgerator
and
not
the
beer
cellar
but
still
has
good
taste
regardless
of
temp
it
was
very
drinkable
and
would
go
with
some
roast
and
potatoes
very
well
ive
had
it
with
meat
loaf
and
it
was
great
thats
what
i
love
about
irish
reds
is
that
they
go
very
well
with
beef
very
drinkable
and
i
would
not
mind
having
a
few
during
a
session
di
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
over
alot
of
reds
that
i
have
had
its
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
was
one
of
the
better
sa
offerings
ive
had
lately
packing
a
pleasant
flavor
profile
and
at
only
5
quite
the
nice
sessionalbility
as
well
i
wish
i
could
get
this
in
sixers
rather
than
the
brewmasters

this
bbc
offering
pours
a
clear
medium
brown
liquid
with
a
sudsy
large
head
plenty
of
thick
lacing
pretty
good
amount
of
carbonation
as
well
smell
is
muted
and
faint
what
i
do
get
is
malty
and
sweet
taste
is
better
a
nice
creamy
malt
front
roasted
nuttiness
sweet
but
balanced
a
hint
of
a
bittering
hop
finish
a
solid
come
back
mouthfeel
despite
the
malt
character
is
somewhat
refreshing
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
brew
and
one
that
i
will
look
forward
to
during
its
next
release
d
a
good
offering
and
i
will
definitely
return
my
only
complaint
is
with
a
brief
funk
i
picked
up
in
the
nose
this
is
one
of
the
stronger
sam
adams
offerings
ive
come
across
longshot
winners
notwithstanding
its
crisp
and
clean
with
a
tinge
of
sass
and
earth
its
pretty
much
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
and
it
all
comes
together
to
wind
up
tasty
and
drinkable
its
become
one
of
my
wifes
favorites
so
i
wont
mind
at
all
having
it

while
drinking
it
puts
off
a
very
nice
sweet
roasty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
in
the
background
however
the
taste
really
didnt
impress
me
not
a
whole

going
on
up

and
mainly
some
astringent
bitterness
in
the

into
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
medium
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
though
not
horrible
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
d
this
is
not
an
unpleasant
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
strike
me
as
any
better
than
average
in
terms
of
whether
i
want
to
search
it
out

sam
adams
irish
red
pours
a
deep
red
amber
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
fades
the
aroma
is
dark
crystal
malt
and
earthy
almost
dirty
hops
the
crystal
dominates
the
flavor
with
lots
of
dark
fruit
the
beer
is
very
malty
without
being
overly
sweet
the
malt
is
balanced
by
a
crisp
bitterness
and
loads
of
earthy
slightly
floral
hops
the
finish
is
dry
and
smooth
but
the
beers
heaviness
detracts
from
its
drinkability
this
is
good
it
immediately
reminds
me
of
the
thomas
hooker
irish
red
ale
the
sam
adams
however
is
drier
yet
very
rich
in
flavor
theres
a
dry
caramel
and
toffee
flavor
similar
to
the
boston
lager
but
its
complimented
by
spicy
and
smokey
flavors
like
youd
expect
out
of
a
scotch
ale
it
may
be
a
little
off
for
the
style
btu
its
still
darned
tasty
this
is
very
much
an
american
interpretation
of
the
style
the
flavors
are
big
and
the
yeast
doesnt
do
much
but
this
is
a
musttry
if
you
dig
red
ales
this
is
ok
but
i
liked
the
hooker
irish
red
i
had
last
night
a
lot
better
feels
thick
and
a
little
chewy
tiny
burn
on
the
way
down
its
a
bit
of
a
choker
but
nicely
balanced
above
average
drinkability
i
had
two
as
part
of
a
mixed
12
pack
an
ok
beer
but
i
do
not
find
myself
wanting
anymore
than
the
two
that
i
have
had
tonight
deasy
drinking
but
a
beer
with
some
depth
and
character
quality
brew
and
fortunately
it
lacks
the
butterscotch
notes
i
am
finding
more
and
more
in
the
sa
beers
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
served
in
my
sa
sensory
pint
glass
purchase
before
august
2008
notched
on
the
label
poured
a
murky
reddishamber
color
threequarter
inch
offwhite
head
dissipated
into
a
thin
inconsistent
skim
of
foam
some
watery
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
but
weak
adherence
scent
of
malt
predominates
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
taste
similar
to
nose
not
too
much
complexity
here
very
mellow
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
of
a
smooth
buttery
sensation
however
the
mild
carbonation
helps
keep
it
a
little
lively
nice
sessionable
brew
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
easy
to
quaff
this
is
a
very
complex
and
extremely
drinkable
irish
red
ale
it
may
not
be
ultraauthentic
but
its
a
solid
beer
from
sam
adams
they
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
recommended
this
beer
is
nothing
extraordinary
but
like
all
sa
beers
it
does
a
good
job
of
representing
the
syle
tmdhopps
are
pretty
apparent
in
the
first
sip
but
one
could
get
used
to
that
not
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
this
brand
has
yet
too
dissappoint
the
same
toffee
and
sweet
caramel
malts
come
through
moderately
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
only
a
surprisingly
moderate
to
thin
the
beer
does
not
have
strong
flavors
but
is
quite
flavorful
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
im
not
a
huge
irish
red
fan
but
this
one
is
unique
from
the
others
i
may
revisit
it
again
sometime
or
another
this
is
a
nice
beer
has
a
nice
deep
red
appearance
but
i
though
the
smell
was
sort
of
funky
and
mossy
very
smooth
malt
taste
with
a
nice
balance
of
hop
bitterness
while
no
one
thing
really
stands
out
this
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
beer
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sam
adams
not
bad
not
particularly
outstanding
it
was
an
enjoyable
brew
but
i
dont
have
a
desire
to
try
it
again
overall
the
tannins
are
a
little
out
of
whac
and
create
a
little
bit
of
off
flavors
i
wonder
what
happened
i
expected
a
little
bit
more
after
getting
a
whiff
sammy
glass
its
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
nice
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
it
goes
down
very
well
and
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
good
sit
back
and
watch
the
game
beer
im
glad
i
decided
to
try
it
md
very
drinkable
since
it
is
light
in
the
mouth
because
of
smell
and
after
flavor
i
would
buy
again
i
bought
this
in
a
six
pack
at
a
giant
eagle
thankfully
not
in
a
variety
pack
like
someone
else
had
mentioned
really
nicely
done
now
one
of
my
sam
adams
favorites
along
with
the
cream
stout
and
double
bock
nicely
done
perhaps
im
just
not
that
fond
of
red
ales
so
therefore
my
rankings
are
slightly
lower
than
average
the
beer
pours
a
very
ruby
amber
with
not
much
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
but
pretty
much
an
uncarbonated
sticky
feel
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
bready
malts
some
crisp
hop
aromas
and
some
unsweetened
dryish
cherry
hints
the
smell
is
pretty
typical
of
a
red
ale
there
are
lots
of
caramel
malts
some
balance
between
dry
and
sweet
grain
some
bread
like
flavors
but
pretty
much
the
dryish
unsweetened
cherry
fruits
are
pronounced
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
and
aftertaste
are
modest
and
there
is
a
dryish
hoppiness
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
im
just
not
a
big
red
ale
fan
only
bad
thing
is
its
only
available
in
a
mixed
pack
at
the
moment
i
found
this
beer
to
be
flavorful
yet
quite
sessionable
furthermore
i
could
see
it
pairing
well
with
a
variety
of
dishes
d
overall
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
red
but
drinkable
i
wouldnt
pass
up
another
good
session
beer
if
the
grapey
sweetness
doesnt
get
tiring
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
a
pretty
good
red
from
sam
adams
d
went
down
really
well
i
look
forward
to
another
bottle
of
it
a
solid
addition
to
the
sam
adams
line
it
served
well
for
st
patricks
day
d
easy
drinking
enjoyable
brew
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
may
to
seek
out
good
session
beer
pick
up
a
sixer
and
slam
it
down
while
watching
the
ncaa
playoffs
drinkability
very
nice
stab
at
a
style
which
often
disappoints
d
great
great
beer
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
somewhere
i
love
the
brewmasters
packs
from
sam
adams
there
are
always
great
beers
included
in
the
set
and
i
believe
they
nailed
the
irish
red
100
should
give
this
a
shot
when
you
find
it
i
am
pretty
sure
you
will
love
it
too

it
would
not

to
knock

a

of
these
not

still
pretty
smooth
i
like
that
it

at

if
i
want
to
spend
an
evening
or
afternoon
with
these
with
the
intention
of
feeling
good
i
wont
have
to
drink
an
entire
sixer
i
like
having
this
one
in
the
variety
pack
better
than
the
boston
ale
a
very
solid
beer
d
this
is
starting
to
sound
like
a
broken
record
but
another
damn
fine
craft
beer
from
sam
adams
truly
a
springtime
classic
get
it
while
you
can
preferably
with
some
extras
to
store
a
nice
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
good
job
bringing
a
hop
kick
to
an
otherwise
malty
drink
sure
beats
a
runofthemill
irish
red
ale
kudos
an
amber
bodied
beer
with
a
thick
head
that
had
a
reddish
hue
to
it
the
aroma
was
faint
and
had
a
caramel
note
to
it
the
taste
of
caramel
malt
is
the
dominant
character
with
a
slightly
toasted
edge
and
a
bit
of
honey
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
to
nicely
balance
things
out
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
not
thin
though
this
is
a
style
i
dont
usually
rave
about
i
could
go
for
more
of
these
when
in
the
mood
d
overall
a
tasty
brew
from
sam
adams
that
goes
down
easily
and
one
could
easily
session
it
does
not
really
stand
out
in
any
particular
way
but
it
is
good
nevertheless
they
need
to
keep
this
one
around
all
year
and
sell
it
in
6
packs
because
if
they
did
i
would
easily
buy
it
to
hand
out
whenever
the
family
comes
around
pours
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
a
nice
dark
red
with
brown
hints
and
a
frothy
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
strong
dose
of
the
caramel
malt
the
taste
starts
very
malty
and
sweet
finishing
with
a
calmer
malt
flavor
and
a
hint
of
hop
at
the
end
the
aftertaste
is
a
nice
malty
flavor
that
lingers
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
heavy
carbonation
the
flavors
are
really
powerful
here
not
looking
to
balance
this
one
but
to
punch
its
best
qualities
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
a
quality
irish
red
worth
checking
out
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
poured
a
dark
amber
red
with
a
large
hazy
head
with
just
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
toffee
but
the
taste
is
burnt
caramelized
sugar
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
and
lightly
caramelized
drinkability
is
low
because
the
taste
is
overwhelmingly
burnt
i
know
this
is
pretty
fresh
i
bought
it
when
the
sampler
pack
came
out
i
have
one
more
in
the
sampler
pack
and
if
its
of
the
same
taste
i
dont
think
i
will
ever
be
drinking
it
again
a
nice
irish
red
in
my
opinion
but
not
something
i
could
drink
too
many
of
happy
st
patricks
day
sams
irish
red
has
a
nice
redamber
color
and
pours
with
a
strong
head
that
sticks
around
for
about
2
minutes
from
the
bottle
it
will
nicely
fill
a
pint
glass
right
to
the
brim
it
smells
more
bitter
and
tart
than
it
tastes
its
true
flavor
hits
in
after
a
couple
seconds
a
good
irish
red
ale
it
is
mediumlight
on
the
carbonation
and
goes
down
smooth
another
tasty
beer
by
sam
d
good
example
of
an
irish
red
definitely
worth
trying
especially
if
you
like
malty
beers
pours
a
hazy
dark
orangeamber
color
that
is
quite
red
with
lots
of
offwhite
head
that
has
great
sustain
aroma
is
light
and
bready
a
little
toasty
and
slight
buttery
toffee
notes
on
the
palate
it
starts
thin
opens
to
a
tangy
buttery
malt
feel
finishing
dry
with
a
risidual
bitterness
overall
its
a
very
easydrinking
ale
with
just
enough
interest
to
keep
me
coming
back
irish
reds
are
a
pretty
tame
malt
oriented
style
that
is
great
for
the
spring
the
mouthfeel
has
moderate
carbonation
marked
by
a
creamy
slightly
buttery
feel
very
smooth
smell
is
woody
and
cedarlike
some
malt
kicking
through
and
clearly
these
characteristics
are
very
present
in
the
palate
quite
true
to
style
and
drinkable
there
is
maybe
a
more
liberal
usage
of
hops
than
in
many
other
craft
ambers
but
i
think
this
is
a
good
thing
and
applaud
sa
for
making
a
fairly
hoppy
one
like
this
quite
drinkable
as
well
t
the
taste
is
very
easy
and
almost
light
id
say
it
should
be
more
a
3
7
taste
but
we
cant
do
that
so
i
knocked
it
up
it
seems
like
it
should
be
a
bit
heavier
which
is
why
i
decided
to
knock
mouth
feel
instead
there
is
no
real
bitterness
but
its
pretty
good
and
easy
to
drink
light
tan
head
disappears
quickly
the
brew
is
a
clear
reddish
amber
in
the
glass
toasted
grain
dominates
the
nose
and
the
hops
seem
somewhat
floral
grassy
not
in
a
bad
way
this
brew
is
very
well
balanced
sweet
but
not
cloying
toasted
bready
malts
are
offset
nicely
with
floral
hops
this
brew
first
struck
me
as
a
tiny
bit
thin
but
the
more
i
drink
it
i
think
its
about
perfect
for
a
session
brew
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
very
crisp
carbonation
is
excellent
very
smooth
and
satisfying
very
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
fine
offering
from
sam
adams
one
ill
no
doubt
enjoy
again
not
bad
but
im
noticing
the
hop
profile
in
the
sa
varieties
are
almost
all
identical
save
for
the
other
flavors
contributing
not
bad
but
a
little
variety
to
the
hops
would
be
nice
overall
its
a
very
nice
drink
for
the
prespring
a
good
transition
from
the
dark
winter
brews
now
im
just
about
ready
for
some
bocks
and
then
an
abrupt
change
to
light
summer
beers
great
for
the
irish
day
though
ill
probably
be
switching
to
a
tall
guinness
it
might
be
an
irish
red
but
its
an
american
beer
and
id
rather
drink
the
only
irish
beer
ill
drink
on
the
only
day
that
call
for
it
d
one
of
the
best
of
the
sa
brewmaster
series
i
would
love
to
see
this
in
6
packs
the
only
place
ive
seen
this
one
is
in
the
mixed
12
packs
pours
an
attractive
redbrown
with
very
nice
creamcolored
lacing
and
a
head
that
sticks
around
would
be
a
five
for
appearance
but
for
some
chill
haze
smells
of
rich
malts
caramel
roasted
toasted
a
little
rum
earthy
ale
hops
and
a
little
honey
appetizing
tastes
again
of
full
malt
flavors
and
english
ale
hops
kent
goldings
according
to
the
label
a
hint
of
spice
nice
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
medium
to
fullbodied
but
the
hops
dry
it
out
nicely
another
solid
offering
from
bbc
i
might
have
to
change
my
bad
attitude
about
sam
adams
the
brewmasters
collection
this
year
has
been
surprisingly
good
i
am
amazingly
impressed
by
this
new
beer
from
sa
its
a
great
take
on
the
style
and
should
be
a
staple
in
every
beer
drinkers
diet
at
this
time
of
year
definitely
recommended
cheers
to
sa
for
this
wonderful
brew
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
at
a
sitting
not
big
on
the
red
beers
but
this
was
good
d
extremely
drinkable
can
easily
put
down
one
after
another
i
thought
this
beer
was
delicious
i
tend
not
to
love
all
sam
adams
but
this
was
an
exception
it
poured
a
nice
dark
gold
with
a
red
hue
to
it
the
head
was
nice
about
a
finger
but
thinned
quickly
lacing
was
evident
as
there
were
some
spots
around
the
glass
just
no
distinctive
rings
s
it
was
rather
nice
it
was
a
toasted
malty
smell
and
fuggle
hops
with
a
woody
smell
it
reminded
me
of
the
smell
when
walking
into
a
brewery
the
wart
i
actually
liked
the
smell
ttasted
nice
velvety
carbonated
with
nice
distinct
red
ale
flavor
very
nice
wish
i
had
more
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
deep
redcopper
color
forming
a
thick
creamy
1
inch
tan
head
medium
spots
of
lace
dot
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
strong
sweet
malts
with
a
hint
of
hops
sweet
and
simple
the
taste
is
smooth
sweet
malts
creating
a
creamy
nutty
light
caramel
flavor
medium
smooth
mouthfeel
full
flavor
and
medium
alcohol
make
for
a
highly
drinkable
ale
overall
this
is
a
great
session
ale
definitely
a
new
favorite
from
sam
adams
very
toasty
and
sweet
smelling
caramel
malt
on
the
nose
pours
a
nice
head
and
doesnt
go
away
that
quickly
leaving
nice
lacing
tastes
toasty
as
well
with
some
nice
peppery
spices
and
bready
malt
nice
english
tasting
hops
on
the
back
with
a
bit
of
soury
unpleasantness
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
sam
adams
best
beers
however
imo
it
rivals
conways
irish
ale
which
is
my
favorite
irish
ale
this
may
be
slightly
better
very
nice
session
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
might
be
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
a
session
beer
but
solid
nonetheless
drinkable
beer
though
as
one
would
expect
form
this
brewery
it
was
a
good
fall
back
beer
after
a
dissapointing
evening
long
story
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
reds
i
will
be
sure
to
buy
this
again
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
an
evening
and
not
want
for
anything
else
i
see
many
more
of
these
in
my
immediate
future
a
good
tasting
beer
you
could
drink
this
all
night
irish
reds
just
dont
have
a
ton
of
flavor
to
me
there
are
drinkable
and
theres
subtleties
there
but
i
aside
from
pilsners
i
like
bigger
flavor
in
my
beer
pours
a
somewhat
clear
amber
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
into
the
sa
specialty
glass
retention
and
lacing
are
great
smells
of
roasted
malts
nuts
tea
leaves
and
subtle
pine
taste
has
some
sweetness
which
is
quickly
offset
by
hops
and
a
slight
spiciness
light
to
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smoothing
going
down
carbonation
is
adequate
my
first
irish
red
so
i
cant
compare
with
other
brands
but
this
is
wellbalanced
and
tasty
me
likes
style
go
try
some
truly
a
session
beer
and
an
awesome
one
at
that
i
wish
they
brewed
this
year
round
as
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
glad
i
listened
to
my
fellow
bas
on
this
one
as
this
is
definately
one
great
beer
another
hit
from
the
boys
at
boston
i
got
this
beer
in
one
of
the
sam
adams
samplers
i
had
to
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
better
irish
red
beers
you
can
find
a
very
malty
tastesmell
it
is
not
overly
bitter
and
has
a
subtle
sweetness
to
it
decent
color
and
head
retention
it
is
a
very
good
session
beer
i
recommend
this
to
someone
looking
for
a
tasty
easyily
drinkable
malty
brew
i
like
it
i
real
treat
out
of
the
brewers
collection
i
am
a
fan
of
the
sam
adams
but
i
thought
this
still
tasted
a
lot
at
the
end
like
commercial
boston
lager
apperance
was
a
deep
red
with
a
nice
1
finger
head
that
was
there
for
most
of
the
beer
smell
was
nice
and
malty
with
lots
of
spice
the
taste
was
very
pleasant
with
the
spice
up
front
and
the
ale
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
very
creamy
the
drink
was
good
but
i
would
savor
it
more
than
drink
it
to
drink
recommended
serving
type
bottle
i
could
only
find
this
in
the
brewmaster
collection
hope
to
find
this
in
a
six
or
twelve
pack
sometime
overall
a
nice
beer
not
the
best
but
by

from

along

there
a

are

where
the

tart
d
not
bad
but
not
all
that
great
either
sure
looks
pretty
though
this
is
too
similar
to
sa
boston
lager
and
its
not
very
much
to
style
this
could
use
a
lot
more
hops
too

this
beer
moves
to
the
top
of
my
favorites
list
would
and
did
buy
another
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
beer
at
my
local
distributor
and
immediately
bought
a
case
at
first
glance
i
compared
it
to
killians
red
but
after
drinking
knew
this
was
indeed
more
of
an
ale
as
opposed
to
the
lager
taste
of
killians
it
has
a
distinct
ale
aftertaste
cant
place
all
of
the
flavors
amateur
taster
at
best
with
a
bitter
tinge
but
is
very
drinkable
and
i
highly
reccomend
it
i
was
told
by
the
distributo
it
is
only
available

i
could
have
this

by
the
pint
this
beer
pours
a
incredibly
brilliant
deep
true
red
there
is
a
nice
thick
offwhite
head
with
good
lacing
throughout
the
beer
the
aroma
is

overall
this
is
an
incredible
brew
one

the
best

fingers

dissipates
to
a
nice
one
finger
thick
layer
atop
the

the

sheets

along

the
cranberry
and
peppry
flavors
are
a
bit
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
sticky
with
medium
body
and
quite
carbonated
the
let
down
for
me
is
certainly
the
taste
i
was
very
excited
to
drink
this
after
smelling
it
but
the
taste
didnt
pull
through
how
i
would
have
liked
may
be
good
with
herb
crusted
chicken
or
thanksgiving
dinner
the
caramel
is
more
like
a
sweet
buttery
toffee
and
the
golding
hops
are
so
bland
yet
bitter
that
i
find
myself
longing
for
some
balancing
fuggle
hops
really
not
so
bad
but
this
sample
is
similar
to
the
boston
lager
except
much
sweeter
not
a
session
for
me
but
id
hardly
turn
one
down
when
handed
to
me
a
little
bland
more
like
a
weak
scotch
ale
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
smooth
and
mellow
irish
red
that
is
neither
taxing
nor
overly
sweet
as
some
tend
to
get
cheers
d
good
irish
red
definitely
a
cut
above
the
average
its
a
great
session
beer
and
defines
the
style
well
i
will
buy
this
again
maybe
even
take
the
place
of
my
current
favorite
the
beer
poured
with
a
beautiful
red
body
and
a
big
offwhite
head
the
beer
smelled
strongly
of
sweet
malts
and
it
got
me
excited
unfortunately
the
taste
did
not
completely
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
it
was
decent
but
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
did
not
meld
together
in
a
convincing
and
fully
satisfying
way
and
that
keeps
this
beer
from
being
truly
excellent
overall
though
it
was
a
enjoyable
drinking
experience
id
get
it
again
sometime
overall
impression
nicely
drinkable
plenty
of
flavor
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
lineup
another
jesss
market
find
pours
a
dark
redbrown
color
with
a
medium
head
smells
a
bit
biscuity
lightly
so
tastes
of
slightly
smoky
malt
caramel
slight
citrus
hint
in
the
background
not
expecting
that
but
its
good
overall
its
another
satisfying
beer
from
sam
adams
hopefully
itll
be
made
easier
to
find
than
the
double
bock
in
these
parts
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
beers
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
their
oktoberfest
i
am
pleased
to
see
that
sam
adams
is
branching
off
from
the
boston
lager
mold
i
liked
this
one
overall
very
drinkable
with
any
meats
or
on
its
own
id
buy
this
again
d
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
i
had
several
without
even
thinking
about
it
a
very
good
example
of
the
red
style
very
enjoyable
as
i
wait
until
this
beer
arrives
in
my
area
i
wonder
if
it
will
take
on
the
classic
toasted
maltiness
with
a
crisp
hop
counterpart
or
become
grainy
artificially
caramel
and
metalic
like
many
other
american
breweries
deliver
turns
out
to
be
the
former
the
beer
opens
with
a
bright
ruby
color
with
hints
of
darkness
brown
with
a
terrific
slightoftan
head
formation
retention
and
adequate
carbonation
aromas
of
rich
malt
lightly
toasted
malts
nuts
and
an
ester
that
reminds
me
of
timid
berries
a
fresh
wethop
aroma
gives
a
distinct
pungent
earthy
herbal
and
at
times
piney
character
that
later
transfers
directly
to
flavor
along
with
the
hops
the
malts
deliver
a
steady
medium
malty
flavor
that
hinges
of
fresh
bread
yeast
and
toast
a
well
attenuated
crisp
crackerlike
flavor
provides
a
nice
pillow
for
the
piney
hops
and
light
esters
kinda
like
the
ale
version
of
an
oktoberfest
but
with
increased
maltiness
finishes
clean
and
with
a
mild
pleasant
pine
flavor
a
very
nice
beer
worthy
of
the
sam
adams
branding
d
another
fine
seasonal
brew
from
sam
adams
it
is
very
sessionable
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
offer
from
sam
adams
i
must
admit
i
came
in
not
expecting
much
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
in
the
result
i
love
big
hoppy
beers
so
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
fall
in
love
with
but
the
malt
character
is
very
intriguing
and
keeps
me
reaching
for
the
remaining
beers
very
sessionable
which
is
also
a
plus
a
nice
wellbalanced
beer
with
perfect
drinkability
would
be
nice
to
session
mf
d
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
with
a
reasonable
alcohol
content
pushing
it
high
on
my
drinkability
list
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
is
a
bit
much
resulting
in
a
bit
of
acidity
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
that
aside
this
is
a
very
pleasant
drinking
experience
overall
good
solid
beer
that
does
a
lot
right
but
not
extra
special
drinks
pretty
easy
the
dryness
might
wear
on
me
after
a
while
a
pretty
good
irish
red
but
give
me
the
scotch
ale
in
six
packs
now
cheers
to
a
brewer
out
there
that
makes
the
american
beer
scene
better
every
day
it
has
a
crisp
almost
lagerish
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
it
focuses
on
malt
sweetness
and
does
a
solid
job
of
it
bright
clear
amber
red
appearance
with
a
two
finger
head
that
faded
fairly
quickly
smelled
faintly
of
barley
soft
but
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
moderate
carbonation
decent
malt
flavor
with
a
slightly
metallic
taste
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
glad
theres
another
red
on
the
market
drink
for
a
style
that
has
disappointed
me
so
many
times
in
the
past
i
must
say
that
i
am
impressed
at
the
depth
of
character
that
samuel
adams
has
crafted
into
their
version
not
overly
malty
and
certainly
not
wimping
out
on
the
hops
either
this
beer
is
definitely
one
that
could
be
sessioned
or
enjoyed
all
evening
long
at
a
party
pours
a
deep
reddish
amber
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
into
a
boston
lager
glass
good
head
retention
and
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
a
very
nice
sweet
caramel
malt
presence
dominates
the
aroma
along
with
some
grain
and
a
faint
touch
of
citrus
and
fruit
taste
is
more
caramel
and
biscuity
malt
pretty
well
balanced
and
a
somewhat
grainy
finish
that
i
could
do
without
easy
drinker
pretty
good
irish
red
in
my
opinion
the
appearance
is
a
bright
amberred
with
a
ridiculously
thin
head
that
does
last
throughout
the
drink
a
good
malty
aroma
overall
permeates
from
the
drink
the
taste
is
wicked
good
sweetness
wrapped
in
flavors
of
malt
and
caramel
the
carbonation
allows
it
to
be
pretty
refreshing
and
crisp
while
being
both
malty
and
light
this
drink
might
still
not
win
over
all
but
i
highly
enjoyed
this
great
drink
from
sam
adams
certainly
a
better
beer
but
for
my
personal
taste
it
had
too
much
butter
taste
and
after
taste
to
be
a
great
beer
d
this
would
be
a
good
session
beer
pretty
tasty
little
beer
except
for
the
aftertaste
i
would
probably
pick
a
different
irish
red
ale
if
it
were
available
though
that
being
said
this
is
pretty
good
more
hop
presence
than
many
good
balance
as
well
a
pretty
neutral
everyday
nonintimidating
brew
very
quaffable
would
have
been
cool
to
see
something
more
extravagant
from
sam
adams
but
were
not
too
far
removed
from
the
imperial
pilsner
and
there
is
a
hop
shortage
so
i
can
understand
im
really
not
much
into
this
style
but
sa
did
brilliant
work
on
this
and
made
it
their
own
not
over
sweet
nice
hop
addition
to
really
give
the
malts
a
perfect
counter
balance
it
looks
tastes
and
feels
great
ill
be
bringing
this
to
my
towns
st
pattys
day
fest
this
year
for
sure
all
i
can
say
is
wow
overall
a
fantastic
brew
i
find
only
one
or
two
of
jimsams
brews
outright
unpleasant
a
lot
of
it
as
solid
if
not
my
pick
and
then
a
few
select
to
be
absolutely
outstanding
to
my
palate
this
is
one
of
the
outstanding
in
my
book
i
cant
say
it
edges
out
rock
art
red
in
flavor
but
besides
for
being
nearly
as
stunning
in
its
own
way
this
is
way
cheaper
easier
to
get
at
the
moment
and
it
knocked
me
out
by
exceeded
my
expectations
when
i
took
a
single
so
im
paying
my
dues
and
stocking
it
cheers
to
sam
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
color
with
a
beige
three
finger
head
with
a
easy
pour
with
some
lace
could
have
been
better
fruity
aromas
with
a
hint
of
caramel
taste
is
sweet
fruity
malty
caramel
with
a
slight
tea
finish
mouthfeel
light
and
carbonation
ok
very
nice
beer
notes
i
found
this
one
in
this
years
samuel
adams
brewmaster
collection
pack
only
two
but
it
will
do
i
wish
this
one
would
be
brewed
year
round
but
oh
well
if
its
not
i
could
definately
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
cheers
d
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
dont
see
myself
keeping
this
around
but
it
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
a
decent
red
but
nothing
too
memorable
the
distinct
spiciness
distinguishes
this
from
other
amber
ales
drinkability
already
an
ideal
style
for
sessioning
this
beer
is
an
allseason
winner
if
you
just
read
off
those
detected
flavors
it
sounds
like
a
scotch
ale
but
its
not
its
got
more
of
a
lagery
drinkability
to
it
its
uncomplicated
and
drinks
easily
this
isnt
meant
as
a
harsh
critique
and
the
irish
and
scotch
alike
will
cringe
but
its
like
diet
scotch
ale
so
there
pours
a
dark
oaklike
color
with
little
to
no
head
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
of
dark
crystal
malts
hiding
beneath
the
surface
the
dark
crystal
hits
again
nicely
in
the
taste
with
a
astringent
and
slightly
weak
finish
obviously
calciumtreated
water
which
goes
well
with
the
crystal
malts
and
the
irish
feel
of
the
beer
medium
body
with
peppery
carbonation
pretty
tasty
the
astringency
gets
to
me
a
bit
but
part
of
it
is
the
water
sort
of
like
drinking
a
killkenny
only
made
in
boston
really
quite
a
good
irish
red
and
one
of
the
few
in
the
style
that
id
be
happy
to
have
a
few
of
ranks
with
goose
islands
kilgubben
as
one
of
the
best
of
the
bunch
mrdium
bodied
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
poured
a
clean
brown
ruby
color
the
beige
head
was
smooth
creamy
it
stuck
around
for
quite
awhile
good
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
similar
to
the
boston
ale
it
is
sugary
sweet
and
has
notes
of
caramal
and
malt
delicious
complex
rich
and
sweet
the
light
hop
flavor
tastes
great
with
the
malty
caramel
and
sugar
flavor
this
beer
is
so
smooth
it
is
airy
and
creamy
somewhat
like
a
boddingtons
there
is
lots
going
on
here
i
could
drink
this
forever
in
one
sitting
very
nice
pour
it
has
a
ruby
red
color
rather
dark
except
when
held
to
the
light
with
a
thick
creamy
halfinch
of
head
on
top
longlasting
nose
is
a
bit
disappointing
theres
some
caramel
malt
with
a
light
floral
hop
presence
first
taste
is
a
lightly
caramel
malt
together
with
noble
hop
flavor
quite
similar
to
the
stock
ale
if
i
remember
the
taste
right
good
body
for
the
strength
with
a
neutral
texture
pours
a
nice
deep
golden
red
with
a
hefty
creamy
twofinger
head
that
stuck
around
for
the
duration
leaving
a
thick
sheen
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
was
pretty
much
biscuity
bready
malts
the
taste
had
a
surprising
citrusy
fruity
sensation
on
the
intake
moving
to
a
cookielike
buttery
diacetyl
presence
finishing
with
the
mildest
hoppy
twinge
and
a
long
lingering
yeasty
bready
flavor
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
was
thinnner
and
weaker
than
i
would
have
liked
drinkability
is
decent
a
somewhat
interesting
beer
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
but
probably
wouldnt
select
if
it
was
sold
on
its
own
in
a
6pack
either
verdict
ok
not
too
exciting
the
signature
yeast
flavor
is
present
but
doesnt
have
enough
supporting
character
to
bring
me
back
a
very
drinkable
beer
nothing
special
but
a
really
sessionable
brew
i
like
it
and
will
bury
a
bunch
of
these
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
the
taste
is
deceptively
complex
with
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
complementing
sweet
berry
and
milk
chocolate
malt
really
delicious
although
this
is
moderately
sweet
there
is
a
nice
touch
of
bitter
that
does
not
fade
from
irish
red
the
carbonation
is
wellbalanced
allaround
good
beer
not
spectacular
but
very
good
surprisingly
so
i
cant
say
that
irish
red
ale
is
atop
my
list
of
preferred
styles
but
this
is
highly
drinkable
delicious
and
enjoyable
well
done
d
very
much
so
i
would
happily
have
another
pours
a
bright
amberreddish
color
with
an
immense
tan
head
great
retention
as
well
as
lacing
smell
is
of
sweet
caramel
malts
pineapple
earthyspicy
citrusy
taste
is
very
spicy
malty
earthy
fruity
bitter
finish
and
an
ever
so
quaint
touch
of
peat
medium
body
well
carbonated
dry
finish
pretty
drinkable
this
one
turned
out
better
than
i
had
expected
it
to
be
pours
murky
reddish
burnt
orange
with
1
5
finger
beige
head
which
dissipates
quickly
but
not
entirely
and
leaves
decent
lacing
all
the
way
down
smells
fresh
but
that
is
about
all
i
can
gather
my
nose
is
not
very
good
taste
is
very
robust
and
pleasing
with
malt
up
front
and
fruithop
hint
at
end
i
can
take
one
sip
and
still
taste
it
several
minutes
later
which
i
find
pleasant
this
is
a
good
beer
that
has
a
lot
going
on
with
lots
of
flavor
unfortunately
only
two
in
the
sa
bm
12
pack
so
would
definitely
buy
on
its
own
if
i
run
across
sixer
d
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
its
nothing
too
special
its
an
easy
drink
and
has
a
solid
flavor
and
balance
that
you
would
expect
from
a
sam
adams
the
smooth
mouthfeel
was
nice
but
other
than
that
nothing
really
stood
out
which
could
also
be
a
good
thing
an
enjoyable
beer
i
figure
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
introduce
newbies
but
like
many
other
sam
adams
products
i
think
it
lacks
a
distinctive
punch
and
its
quality
lies
only
slightly
over
the
median
drinkability
id
say
its
ok
i
wouldnt
probably
buy
it
by
itself
on
purpose
especially
the
way
sam
adams
is
pricing
their
six
packs
these
days
but
as
part
of
a
12pack
brewmasters
select
collection
its
worthwhile
a
nice
filler
good
for
some
variety
in
your
fridge
or
for
a
party
d
this
is
a
hell
of
a
drinkable
brew
nice
flavors
going
on
make
you
want
more
abv
is
on
the
higher
side
of
the
average
for
an
irish
red
but
not
so
high
that
you
cant
have
quite
a
few
of
these
definitely
going
to
move
into
my
rotation
of
session
beers
when
im
not
looking
to
satisfy
my
hop
craving
but
am
not
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
beer
this
beer
pours
a
clear
ruby
color
the
head
is
large
fluffy
and
recedes
very
slowly
into
a
nice
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
lightly
malty
with
a
nice
touch
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
it
is
very
balance
and
light
without
being
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
if
they
keep
this
beer
in
the
brewmasters
collection
sampler
i
will
certainly
drink
it
again
it
sure
beats
the
cranberry
lambic
this
is
my
first
bottle
of
this
and
really
enjoyed
it
definately
worth
a
try
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
dark
red
color
and
when
i
poured
it
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
had
a
tan
halfinch
head
this
dissipated
after
a
minute
and
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
i
like
the
smell
theres
some
hop
aroma
and
a
roasty
malt
scent
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
good
as
the
look
and
smell
and
leaves
an
aftertaste
that
is
sticky
i
think
this
would
make
a
good
dinner
beer
paired
with
something
meaty
and
irish
i
suppose
its
not
a
session
beer
at
least
not
for
me
but
overall
not
a
bad
choice
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
ale
more
than
once
i
remarked
that
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
red
its
the
kind
of
drink
that
you
can
take
in
any
time
and
enjoy
it
dvery
good
drinkability
smooth
maltiness
and
fresh
berries
combine
to
make
a
easy
fruity
drinking
irish
style
red
that
is
enjoyable
in
multiples
pours
a
really
nice
dark
red
color
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
the
beer
has
a
sweet
malty
and
slightly
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
delivers
just
that
nice
malty
base
with
a
hoppy
finish
with
a
caramel
hint
to
it
this
is
a
good
irish
red
but
it
wasnt
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
hoped
not
a
bad
beer
though
a
nice
take
on
this
type
of
beer
this
beer
has
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
very
smooth
feel
to
it
that
i
really
enjoyed
a
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
my
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
clear
deep
red
color
slightly
tan
head
is
about
23
inch
thick
when
poured
fairly
quickly
settles
to
a
nice
thick
ring
lining
the
inside
of
the
glass
with
decent
lace
has
a
nice
rich
caramel
and
malty
aroma
also
some
fruit
and
tart
smells
here
the
taste
is
slightly
roasted
malty
and
sweet
upfront
with
flavors
of
caramel
and
tart
also
a
bit
of
a
breadyyeast
flavor
rounded
out
by
some
hop
bitterness
good
malt
and
hop
balance
here
i
just
wish
the
flavors
were
a
bit
stronger
overall
though
has
a
full
bodied
crisp
smooth
and
frothy
mouthfeel
with
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
easy
to
drink
a
good
beer
for
sure
but
sa
could
maybe
have
done
a
little
better
here
m
d
again
could
be
a
little
deeper
but
it
drinks
well
a
decent
feeling
brew
its
not
mindblowing
but
there
are
times
when
that
is
the
mood
id
take
another
if
it
were
offered
though
i
might
not
actively
pursue
it
poured
into
a
sam
glass
and
got
a
twofinger
head
that
quickie
dissipated
the
body
was
a
nice
bronze
red
the
aroma
is
rich
with
caramel
and
malt
also
can
detect
a
flowery
almost
citrus
hint
a
roasted
caramel
malt
taste
with
a
bitter
after
taste
it
is
lightly
carbonated
with
a
decent
body
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
worth
buying
a
six
pack
the
body
here
is
on
the
full
side
but
the
carbonation
is
quite
low
and
the
beer
goes
down
pretty
easily
a
bit
less
sweetness
and
id
have
a
few
more
as
it
is
itll
be
a
novelty
march
17th
beer
for
me
that
i
wouldnt
otherwise
order
again
i
like
it
d
nicely
balanced
very
smooth
and
juicy
its
dryness
at
the
end
help
its
d
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
buttery
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
a
full
velvety
finish
with
a
slightly
dry
feel
very
well
balanced
and
pleasing
in
fact
on
of
the
better
sa
brews
ive
had
and
i
dont
think
there
are
many
i
havent
the
beer
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
sweet
caramel
malts
its
balanced
with
a
mild
noble
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
solid
pale
and
crytal
malt
flavor
its
semisweet
in
the
beginning
and
dry
in
the
finish
its
incredibly
balanced
with
a
nice
mild
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
and
well
brewed
irish
red
it
doesnt
sell
out
in
the
malt
department
and
finishes
with
excellent
hop
character
d
easily
drinkable
and
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
it
isnt
particularly
compelling
either
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
redamber
with
a
monster
3
cm
offwhite
head
that
is
slowly
diminishing
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
hops
initial
flavor
is
malty
caramel
and
bread
and
citrus
hops
at
the
end
to
balance
it
out
aftertaste
is
very
mild
citrus
nearly
no
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
no
lacing
drinkable
as
a
nice
alternative
to
a
heavy
beer
or
one
with
more
alcohol
or
another
sa
selection
poured
into
a
pint
glass
amd
received
a
onefinger
head
that
mostly
receeded
but
there
was
some
constant
frothiness
w
no
lacings
typical
reddishcopper
body
but
more
than
what
i
expected
w
a
smell
nostrils
picked
up
a
faint
smell
of
citrus
and
bread
but
also
a
nice
smell
of
flowers
and
malt
the
malts
balanced
nicely
with
the
hops
creating
a
springy
mouthfeel
that
is
smooth
w
a
minor
dry
backbite
but
overall
a
creamy
drink
that
is
nicely
flavored
i
will
definitely
pick
up
a
6er
of
this
and
recommend
the
same
to
any
fan
of
irish
red
ales
taste
is
immediately
malty
and
hoppy
at
the
same
time
not
really
separated
into
stages
a
bit
buttery
solid
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
at
the
time
i
voted
for
the
dunkel
but
this
red
will
be
in
the
fridge
often
it
tastes
malty
but
with
more
bitterness
than
i
expected
it
to
have
the
beer
then
finishes
with
a
nice
mild
creaminess
overall
i
rate
this
as
a
great
beer
a
good
addition
to
the
sam
adams
family
of
beers
this
was
a
complete
shocker
i
expected
a
throw
away
item
for
sa
to
test
out
but
i
now
think
this
could
be
boston
beers
best
new
item
in
quite
some
time
i
look
forward
to
being
able
to
buy
this
in
6packs
not
bad
but
nothing
overly
impressive
its
a
bit
too
much
like
or
at
least
seems
like
a
blend
of
some
of
their
other
beers
at
times
i
e
theres
nothing
terribly
distinctive
about
it
that
said
its
represents
the
style
fairly
well
an
along
with
the
boston
lager
scotch
honey
porter
black
lager
and
brown
makes
for
one
of
the
nicer
sa
mixed
packs
in
some
time
liked
it
didnt
love
it
i
have
to
admit
that
i
am
slightly
disappointed
that
this
brew
beat
out
the
dunkel
for
being
the
new
sam
adams
brewmaster
reserve
beer
at
the
same
time
it
doesnt
seem
like
you
see
much
of
this
style
around
on
the
market
so
so
be
it
poured
in
to
my
sam
adams
pint
glass
a
pretty
copper
color
with
a
medium
sized
white
heading
that
eventually
fades
and
leaves
a
ring
around
the
glass
smell
is
clean
for
the
most
part
with
hints
of
cream
and
mint
here
and
there
taste
starts
off
with
a
nice
hop
bite
followed
by
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
to
back
it
up
in
the
middle
things
get
a
bit
creamier
then
finally
it
ends
on
a
buttery
note
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
drinkable
would
make
a
proper
session
beer
pretty
impressive
offering
from
sam
adams
right
here
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
humble
patience
from
magic
hat
which
was
unfortunately
retired
some
time
ago
i
would
definatly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
good
full
malty
flavors
but
still
has
a
little
complexity
to
it
as
well
a
new
sam
adams
found
in
the
brewmasters
collection
12
pk
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrown
color
w
a
thin
offwhite
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
in
my
pint
glass
not
much
smell
some
caramelish
notes
detected
a
crisp
almost
astringent
taste
w
some
caramel
and
darker
fruit
undertones
a
faint
floral
hop
and
diacetyl
in
there
but
not
really
noticeable
a
very
dry
light
bodied
beer
good
co2
just
a
bit
too
dry
for
me
the
more
i
drank
the
thirstier
i
got
not
bad
at
all
for
the
style
quaffff
away
d
a
real
surprise
that
they
havent
made
this
a
more
frequent
offering
as
it
would
crush
most
reds
out
there
smooth
creamy
and
malty
sweet
without
excessive
heft
the
mouthfeel
alone
would
make
it
a
really
nice
session
beer
overall
a
great
brew
sams
site
says
that
irish
red
is
brewed
all
year
long
so
heres
hoping
for
the
sixer
to
come
out
soon
because
when
it
does
ill
be
first
in
line
to
get
it
good
work

it
out
roasty

the
finish

lighter
side

with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
a
pretty
good
drinker
this
one
is
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
for
sure
but
a
fairly
solid
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
dark
deep
red
with
a
large
tan
foamy
head
a
long
lasting
head
with
good
lacing
makes
this
a
nice
looking
beer
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
maybe
some
hops
the
taste
is
crisphoppyand
full
of
sweet
malt
this
is
better
than
i
thought
with
more
of
a
hop
presence
the
mf
is
light
with
the
sweet
malt
and
hops
mixing
very
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
beerone
that
sam
should
sell
all
year
long
decent
if
not
spectacular
sessionable
as
well
d
ok
drinkability
the
robitussinlike
characteristics
took
away
from
the
beer
a
little
bit
for
me

worth
a
try
appears

drinkability
is

a

brew
that
i
could
imagine
being
pretty
popular
in
the
six
pack
format
im
not
sure
what
the
other
options
were
for
them
to
brew
in
this
process
but
i
would
love
to
see
an
american
or
dipa
i
guess
well
have
to
wait
a
year
or
two
for
the
longshot
version

faint
aroma
of
sweet
malt
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
not
a
bad
brew
still
not
a
bad
choice
to
include
in
the
bmc
pours
a
great
dark
copper
color
with
nice
head
and
excellent
horizontal
lacing
nice
malty
scent
a
little
sour
nothing
strong
overall
nice
taste
malty
with
just
a
little
zing
a
bit
of
a
sour
aftertaste
along
with
a
nice
touch
of
spice
goes
down
smoothly
now
that
its
a
part
of
the
brewmasters
pack
i
will
be
drinking
several
of
these
and
enjoying
them
in
a
market
saturated
with
red
ales
i
dont
see
how
this
one
would
get
too
many
purchases
if
it
werent
thrown
in
with
a
sam
variety
pack
i
voted
b
this
is
an
artfully
crafted
beer
which
would
be
even
better
on
tap
than
from
the
bottle
i
think
nicely
done
poured
a
rich
red
color
with
a
solid
1
5
inch
head
just
reaching
the
top
of
the
glass
settled
down
after
a
few
minutes
leaving
much
lacing
at
the
top
after
a
drink
or
two
not
real
set
on
the
nose
but
it
wasnt
terrible
or
anything
like
that
definite
malt
taste
the
caramel
flavor
shines
you
can
pick
out
the
hops
just
a
bit
and
a
little
bitterness
but
it
definitely
doesnt
finish
off
like
a
hopped
beer
normally
would
if
theres
such
a
thing
that
is
i
think
this
beer
would
be
great
in
the
colder
weather
as
the
drinkability
round
after
round
seems
low
of
the
two
at
the
taste
event
i
believe
this
one
would
be
a
six
pack
and
the
dunkel
would
be
inside
a
variety
pack
very
nice
brew
although
i
voted
for
the
dunkelweizen
apparently
only
available
in
boston
part
of
sam
adams
charity
program
i
believe
this
is
only
available
in
massachusetts
but
if
you
are
in
the
great
city
of
boston
you
would
be
better
served
by
trying
another
craft
beer
that
you
cant
get
in
your
home
statecountry
i
have
had
this
a
couple
of
times
now
and
nothing
special
i
consider
it
below
average
is
only
available
at
a
handful
of
bars
in
boston
this
beer
is
brewed
as
a
thank
you
for
the
early
adopters
to
sell
sam
adams
high
quality
very
similar
to
an
irish
red
and
easy
to
pair
with
a
good
chowder
o
actually
a
decent
red
ale
not
too
sweet
moderately
balanced
wonderful
irish
red
ale
it
reminds
me
of
mcsorleys
red
which
i
had
years
ago
in
new
york
city
its
creamy
and
rich
and
has
only
the
slightest
after
taste
of
bitterness
it
has
a
soft
texture
i
think
any
experienced
beer
palate
will
enjoy
this
beer
personally
i
loved
it
second
favorite
sam
adams
beer
next
to
noble
pils
if
you
can
only
get
this
on
tap
around
boston
i
suggest
getting
it
and
you
wont
regret
it
draught
doyles
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
coppery
color
there
is
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
left
lots
of
lacing
nice
nose
caramel
malts
a
subdued
sweetness
some
spicy
earthy
hops
and
a
touch
of
pine
the
taste
is
good
very
clean
well
balanced
malty
slightly
dry
bitter
finish
nice
o
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
kind
of
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
sam
adams
nothing
too
risky
fairly
safe
recipes
that
would
appeal
to
gateway
craft
beer
drinkers
im
glad
that
i
happened
to
find
this
on
tap
while
visiting
boston
for
the
weekend
because
otherwise
i
would
not
have
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
this
and
26
2
both
boston
exclusives
unfortunately
are
both
two
of
the
better
samuel
adams
varieties
i
can
understand
and
appreciate
why
theyre
only
available
in
boston
but
i
still
wish
theyd
bottle
it
and
ship
it
pours
a
deep
amber
almost
red
with
a
decent
sized
tan
head
that
shows
great
retention
smells
of
malty
caramel
and
toffee
with
just
enough
earthy
floral
hops
to
make
it
a
sam
adams
beer
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
and
a
bit
malty
with
a
great
irish
red
caramel
feel
to
it
spicy
earthy
hops
provide
some
balance
to
the
sweetness
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
malty
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
irish
red
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
in
the
hops
i
liked
it
a
bit
it
was
a
treat
to
have
a
rare
sa
beer
while
in
its
home
town
o
what
else
can
be
said
i
am
in
boston
and
you
have
to
embrace
this
type
of
beer
experience
o
good
beer
but
not
a
whole
lot
coming
through
i
could
drink
a
few
o
boston
brick
red
is
a
nice
and
solid
example
of
the
style
in
particular
it
is
very
drinkable
and
a
great
accompaniment
to
a
meal
i
had
this
one
with
pizza
it
is
rare
and
i
definitely
would
like
to
see
more
of
this
one
its
a
good
restaurant
beer
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
it
in
a
bottle
for
comparison
overall
the
malt
profile
is
nice
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
not
particularly
interesting
the
beer
was
a
red
color
and
the
taste
was
fitting
of
a
red
ale
descent
amount
of
head
on
it
but
nothing
stood
out
other
than
the
fact
you
cant
buy
it
in
bottle
form
and
its
rare
to
see
anywhere
not
bad
with
some
chowder
on
par
with
killians
irish
red
oa
more
than
decent
effort
worthy
of
your
attention
o
very
similar
to
their
boston
lager
with
heavier
malts
and
a
lighter
hop
profile
a
decent
beer
to
at
least
try
if
you
get
a
chance
when
you
are
in
the
boston
area
o
just
an
average
irish
red
id
get
it
if
you
see
it
because
of
the
limited
aspect
of
it
but
dont
be
disappointed
if
youre
let
down
maybe
it
was
the
plastic
cup
for
me
but
who
knows
i
had
this
beer
when
we
went
on
the
tour
at
the
bbc
in
boston
the
beer
was
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
a
very
thick
head
the
smell
was
pretty
average
got
a
bit
of
malt
and
tiny
bit
of
hops
the
taste
was
pretty
average
to
me
it
was
like
a
watered
down
version
of
the
boston
lager
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
i
got
a
good
amount
of
crispness
overall
this
beer
is
perfect
for
what
it
is
meant
for
local
bars
and
restaurants
it
isnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
i
love
the
meaning
of
this
beer
it
was
aaite
im
usually
pretty
quick
to
shut
down
a
jim
kosh
beer
but
this
one
was
aaite
i
had
it
at
the
bell
in
hand
supposedly
the
nations
oldest
tavern
in
boston
we
also
had
some
sam
boston
lagers
around
too
and
came
to
the
agreement
that
it
was
like
they
took
the
boston
lager
recipe
and
switched
out
yeasts
and
fermented
it
at
68
degrees
this
isnt
to
say
we
didnt
like
it
the
grain
bill
was
solid
nice
hop
aroma
and
flavor
it
looked
pretty
in
its
glass
it
just
didnt
do
much
else
for
me
that
any
other
american
style
ale
would
do
like
i
said
though
id
give
it
a
solid
aaite
and
probably
order
another
if
given
the
chance
o
not
all
that
impressive
of
a
beer
drinkable
but
its
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
considering
how
much
i
like
most
sam
adams
beers
while
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
would
still
recommend
trying
it
once
just
because
i
havent
tasted
anything
else
quite
like
it
didnt
know
anything
about
this
beer
until
i
got
to
the
brewery
in
boston
last
summer
the
brewery
was
giving
samples
of
this
along
with
a
few
others
since
its
only
sold
in
boston
ill
need
to
make
my
way
back
there
if
i
ever
want
to
have
this
beer
again
the
color
of
the
beer
is
a
deep
red
color
with
a
pretty
decent
looking
head
on
it
the
lacing
was
sporadic
along
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
pleasent
aroma
of
hops
and
malts
the
taste
also
has
a
hoppy
and
malty
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
drinkable
and
just
about
medium
bodied
overall
its
a
good
brew
and
really
worth
checking
out
when
in
boston
i
wish
i
didnt
have
restaurant
distractions
while
trying
this
beer
but
based
on
the
taste
it
was
great
brew
and
was
enjoyed
with
food
but
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
great
medium
body
that
pairs
perfectly
with
the
caramel
and
hints
of
chocolate
some
bitter
hops
towards
the
end
and
a
semidry
finish
overall
it
is
very
good
one
of
the
best
ive
had
for
the
style
sampled
earlier
today
at
epcot
in
disney
world
light
mahogany
red
in
color
with
a
short
offwhite
head
that
reduced
to
a
light
cap
plenty
of
sticky
lacings
malty
caramel
aroma
with
a
very
slight
hint
of
floral
hops
medium
bodied
with
pleasant
carbonation
big
malty
caramel
flavor
up
front
dark
cherry
and
grape
fruit
flavors
through
the
middle
and
light
floral
hop
finish
very
enjoyable
certainly
recommended
on
tap
somewhere
in
massachusetts
rusty
head
with
excellent
retention
nice
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
hop
very
smooth
with
a
subtle
hop
bite
that
balances
out
perfectly
with
the
beers
malt
some
chocolate
malt
a
nice
smooth
irish
red
great
for
the
style
i
could
drink
this
all
afternoon
the
malt
makes
it
to
be
on
the
heavier
side
but
it
was
a
very
nice
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
it
might
not
be
the
best
beer
in
the
style
but
its
decent
enough
to
be
worth
drinking
for
a
while
this
beer
is
only
available
on
tap
in
the
boston
area
its
not
in
every
bar
either
so
you
have
to
look
around
for
it
its
got
a
great
color
a
deep
brick
red
color
hence
the
name
its
got
a
nice
malty
sweetness
to
it
with
a
mild
hop
finish
its
a
great
red
ale
and
one
of
sam
adams
best
beers
in
recent
times
two
enjoyable
pints
later
i
appreciated
the
subtle
complexities
of
this
beer
more
than
i
had
on
previous
occasions
there
was
something
off
of
about
the
grainy
hoppiness
in
the
beer
i
couldnt
place
but
its
a
highly
drinkable
suitably
unique
boston
beer
co
offering
while
its
not
the
best
red
ive
had
or
anything
its
a
good
beer
to
get
you
in
the
boston
frame
of
mind
and
a
good
offering
from
sam
adams
drinkability
an
aboveaverage
and
drinkable
red
but
nothing
more
d
a
soso
irish
red
ale
that
gets
more
props
as
a
bostonnative
taponly
selection
the
flavors
and
abv
are
sessionable
but
its
sort
of
a
tough
pair
and
not
entirely
interesting
enough
flavorwise
to
keep
going
back
to
glad
i
tried
it
so
should
you
and
i
might
be
inclined
to
get
it
again
if
nothing
outshines
it
on
the
tap
line
its
worth
a
try
d
a
very
pleasant
english
style
red
ale
i
could
spend
an
evening
drinking
these
i
saw
this
on
draft
at
a
number
of
bars
in
boston
and
had
never
seen
it
before
i
wasnt
even
sure
what
type
of
beer
it
was
irish
red
makes
sense
this
was
ok
as
with
all
of
sam
adams
beers
it
was
very
solid
and
good
but
as
with
many
of
their
beers
not
altogether
outstanding
good
amberred
color
nice
carbonation
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
always
the
most
interesting
choice
among
a
small
selection
of
marcros
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
pub
today
pours
a
dark
red
tasted
like
a
pretty
standard
irish
red
pretty
malty
yet
smooth
not
alot
standing
out
to
me
as
i
drink
this
beer
pretty
nondescript
not
sure
how
this
is
much
different
than
their
other
red
ales
id
have
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
sorry
for
lack
of
detail
but
a
very
standard
run
of
the
mill
red
ale
not
bad
but
not
great
either
a
very
average
beer
it
pours
a
clear
amber
red
with
a
khakitan
head
more
than
a
finger
strong
solid
wall
of
lace
clings
to
the
glass
with
very
good
head
retension
floral
hops
and
malty
sweetness
comprise
the
aroma
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
sweet
with
an
alcohol
taste
filling
out
the
body
caramel
notes
are
present
and
it
has
a
warming
finish
medium
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
drinkability
a
hoppier
boston
lager
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
sip
all
day
one
of
sam
adams
better
offerings
and
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
in
the
style
it
had
a
clean
after
taste
and
a
definite
drinkability
i
didnt
want
anything
else
while
i
was
in
boston
cheers
sam
adams
has
an
interesting
take
on
the
irish
red
and
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
a
pretty
standard
irish
red
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
worth
a
try
overall
i
could
do
better
easy
to
drink
but
kinda
lacking
any
real
punch
to
make
me
want
an
encore
worth
a
try
but
just
that
d
not
sas
best
effort
by
a
long
shot
very
malty
but
too
much
toasted
flavor
with
an
strange
abrupt
hops
finish
that
adds
up
to
a
poorly
cohesive
brew
tried
this
beer
on
recommendation
from
the
staff
and
found
it
quite
enjoyable
i
had
never
heard
of
this
sam
adams
product
so
was
pretty
excited
served
in
a
becker
which
nicely
accentuated
the
deep
red
color
of
this
beer
and
the
2
fine
finger
eggshell
head
that
stuck
around
well
and
left
some
good
lacing
the
smell
was
a
little
worrisome
as
it
was
virtually
not
there
but
being
in
a
steak
house
sort
of
over
whelms
the
senses
so
perhaps
it
had
more
than
the
slight
maltiness
to
which
i
would
give
it
credit
the
taste
seemed
to
be
very
forward
on
the
palette
but
with
very
little
after
taste
this
beer
seems
like
a
more
full
version
of
many
of
the
reds
i
have
tried
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
any
time
and
they
could
be
well
served
to
compliment
a
good
steak
any
day
this
beer
is
dark
red
in
color
and
clear
has
light
to
moderate
carbonation
with
a
slight
head
there
is
a
slight
plum
and
carmel
aroma
and
the
taste
is
of
alcohol
and
plum
this
is
an
ok
session
beer
and
i
was
happy
to
find
it
on
tap
though
i
do
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
remarkable
pretty
authentic
take
on
an
irish
red
unfortunately
the
horrible
aroma
brings
the
drinkability
down
in
my
book
a
great
beer
without
being
flashy
one
of
my
favorites
by
sa
very
similar
to
their
irish
red
reviewed
on
06222009
on
tap
at
sunset
grill
boston
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brownish
red
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
indistinct
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
sweet
initially
with
lots
of
sweet
malt
this
is
just
a
bland
malty
mess
of
a
beer
nothing
special
meh
i
know
irish
reds
are
supposed
to
be
malty
but
this
one
just
seems
a
bit
too
malty
to
me
perhaps
its
the
onenote
dominance
of
the
malt
flavors
its
a
decent
beer
but
most
likely
not
one
that
ill
have
again
especially
if
there
are
better
options
on
tap
d
not
bad
but
pretty
standard
this
beer
pours
a
deep
crystal
clear
red
when
served
not
much
of
a
head
more
like
a
slight
film
that
was
offwhite
nice
wispy
lacing
left
along
the
glass
nose
is
somewhat
muted
with
most
notably
caramel
malts
present
taste
makes
up
for
lack
of
scent
very
sweet
this
beer
is
loaded
with
amber
caramel
and
toffee
malts
there
was
a
touch
of
breadiness
in
the
middle
and
finished
out
for
more
sweet
caramel
malts
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
body
nice
carbonation
crisp
going
down
with
a
slightly
sticky
finish
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
sam
adams
brewery
but
ive
found
a
brew
that
is
highly
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
on
tap
only
in
the
city
of
boston
and
cambridge
for
a
limited
time
so
i
have
been
trying
to
have
a
pint
whenever
i
can
had
a
pint
on
saturday
night
at
a
bar
on
boylston
st
served
in
a
pint
glass
clear
bright
red
color
minimal
head
and
good
amount
of
carbonation
smell
was
nothing
special
taste
was
good
and
different
at
the
same
time
good
in
the
sense
that
it
had
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
and
different
in
that
it
didnt
really
taste
like
a
sam
adams
it
was
refreshing
but
i
would
not
have
guessed
sa
i
think
i
like
this
one
more
than
the
irish
red
theyve
had
out
in
the
past
a
nice
oneoff
beer
to
serve
to
the
locals
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
irish
red
not
sure
how
close
to
the
style
it
was
but
nevertheless
very
malty
and
smooth
ive
always
found
irish
red
ales
and
lagers
to
be
a
bit
bland
but
sam
adams
does
it
again
i
really
liked
this
had
a
nice
malty
smell
and
drank
very
smooth
and
had
kind
of
a
sweet
aftertaste
very
tasty
brick
red
is
the
perfect
description
of
the
color
because
it
was
a
deep
dark
amberred
color
i
really
hope
this
gets
marketed
and
is
in
stores
itd
be
one
id
pick
up
on
occasion
thats
for
sure
it
went
really
well
with
the
buffalo
wings
i
had
this
beer
has
a
great
feel
to
it
with
a
nice
refreshing
crsip
taste
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
pretty
darn
smooth
fairly
drinkable
beer
pretty
average
overall
glad
i
tried
it
far
more
bitter
than
i
expected
good
malt
flavor
which
means
its
wellbalanced
the
aftertaste
is
short
lived
full
bodied
with
a
proper
level
of
carbonation
overall
a
decent
red
for
my
bachelor
party
my
pals
took
me
both
to
doyles
and
the
sam
adams
tour
at
both
places
the
brick
red
which
they
said
was
released
thursday
feb
26th
was
being
served
the
tour
guide
described
the
drink
as
being
similar
to
the
already
aptly
named
sam
adams
irish
red
ale
from
memory
this
drink
was
much
darker
than
the
sam
adams
irish
red
ale
hence
the
brick
name
a
frothy
head
with
some
decent
lacing
was
also
noticed
in
both
the
sample
cup
and
glass
i
had
at
doyles
aromas
of
malty
spice
were
noticeable
a
sharp
malt
sweetness
was
enjoyable
prevalent
in
the
drink
other
flavors
included
hints
of
hops
toffee
and
bread
wrapped
in
the
roasty
crispness
of
the
carbonation
overall
if
you
are
in
the
greater
boston
area
you
should
try
this
up
while
it
lasts
330
ml
bottle
poured
into
an
english
pint
glass
dark
orange
amber
in
hue
with
minimal
white
head
just
a
smattering
rimming
the
edges
of
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
little
toast
dried
fruit
butterscotch
chips
walnut
with
some
earthy
tealike
hops
indeed
hoppier
than
expected
with
some
heavier
grass
and
resin
notes
accompanied
by
lighter
citrus
dried
plum
and
caramel
as
advertized
with
some
brown
bread
alcohol
faintly
detectable
moderately
full
bodied
and
carbonation
on
the
low
end
rather
buttery
and
smooth
yet
tannic
in
the
finish
does
suffer
from
a
little
of
the
classic
big
rock
caramel
malt
overdose
syndrome
but
all
in
all
a
wellexecuted
and
satisfying
irish
red
mild
and
fullbodied
irish
style
ale
slight
indication
of
nugget
nops
warm
toffee
and
caramel
aroma
slight
notes
of
plum
copperishdark
red
coloration
very
smooth
definitely
the
best
irish
style
ale
ive
tried
in
canada
45
errr
this
is
craftbeer
canada
eh
can
a
guy
get
a
better
beer
next
time
he
visits
a
foreign
country
this
is
a
boozy
hot
caramelspiced
mess
i
had
very
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
it
falls
short
its
ok
and
not
nearly
a
drainpour
but
could
certainly
be
improved
imo
seems
like
something
massed
produced
easy
to
drink
light
and
crisp
clean
finish
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
ale
with
a
malty
profile
nothing
exceptional
but
its
something
i
could
see
myself
trying
again
not
too
bad
o
an
ok
stab
at
it
i
guess
though
it
is
not
something
a
style
i
was
normally
going
to
go
out
and
buy
so
i
will
look
for
better
options
in
the
future
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
big
rock
its
easily
drinkable
with
a
good
combination
of
flavors
watch
out
or
youll
pound
back
a
case
would
definitely
recommend
some
nuttiness
at
times
a
stronger
version
of
a
red
ale
not
my
thing
d
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
mix
of
flavours
and
feels
the
7
abv
goes
unnoticed
maybe
not
a
sesson
beer
but
a
great
brew
i
wish
they
would
brew
some
new
stuff
other
then
the
bandwagon
lime
lager
and
the
decent
but
not
great
winter
spice
for
the
abv
its
quite
drinkable
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
initial
sweetness
and
find
it
masks
any
real
flavour
not
a
bad
brew
and
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
produced
by
big
rock
but
i
cant
really
say
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
very
easy
to
drink
ampedup
irish
ale
which
as
already
mentioned
goes
well
with
many
sorts
of
food
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
but
the
extra
alcohol
kind
of
makes
that
a
moot
point
after
bottle
or
round
number
2
quite
pleasingly
so
d
this
beers
defining
characteristic
for
a
higherabv
beer
it
goes
down
easy
you
could
put
back
a
case
on
a
summers
night
without
thinking
too
hard
about
it
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
the
class
its
in
definately
worth
a
try
my
only
negative
remark
i
have
for
this
beer
is
big
rock
only
has
it
in
6
packs
where
i
live
back
in
then
day
this
was
the
beer
that
writers
such
as
michael
jackson
raved
about
now
it
stands
as
a
decent
beer
but
still
one
of
big
rocks
best
shouldnt
this
brewery
have
moved
up
to
better
beers
rather
than
down
the
beer
is
caramel
coloured
malty
on
the
nose
and
big
in
the
body
the
drinkability
is
suspect
at
times
with
weird
notes
showing
up
on
the
finish
however
i
like
this
beer
as
it
is
complex
for
the
style
and
well
put
together
tastes
faily
smooth
but
again
that
big
rock
flavor
too
sweet
in
their
hopmalt
balance
is
evident
here
a
dry
finish
which
one
would
expect
with
this
type
not
bad
but
there
seems
to
be
a
sameness
with
this
brewers
ales
has
anyone
else
noticed
this
pours
a
fairly
dark
copperred
with
a
very
small
beige
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
surfacing
energetically
makes
it
look
like
a
slightly
dark
ginger
ale
smell
is
very
malty
and
quite
sweet
caramel
and
fruitiness
with
some
biscuity
notes
and
a
mild
herbal
tone
dry
nuttiness
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
acidic
entering
with
a
sour
note
caramel
again
to
be
sure
but
over
boiled
and
a
bit
metallic
in
nature
spicy
hops
play
a
role
but
only
add
to
the
sharp
feeling
in
the
taste
profile
finish
is
drier
with
the
nuts
and
a
touch
of
apple
showing
up
mouthfeel
starts
off
with
good
body
and
nice
carbonation
but
fades
near
the
end
and
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
overall
the
best
beer
ive
yet
had
from
big
rock
which
isnt
saying
a
whole
lot
thx
i
like
the
taste
of
this
one
its
probably
one
of
my
favorite
big
rock
brews
dense
and
fruity
malty
good
hop
taste
a
bit
alcoholic
but
not
overpoweringly
so
nice
bite
on
the
tongue
surprisingly
since
the
beer
appears
a
bit
flat
good
and
warm
going
down
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
on
a
cold
winter
night
a
brownish
copper
brew
with
a
pleasing
malty
aroma
somewhat
low
carbonation
the
head
was
quite
small
and
disappeared
fairly
quickly
quite
smooth
going
down
with
a
fair
amount
of
hop
and
alcohol
bite
some
bready
oaky
and
mineral
hints
as
well
not
really
my
style
but
still
somewhat
enjoyable
taste
this
one
is
meant
to
be
served
warmer
i
pour
it
fairly
cold
and
it
almost
seems
metallic
but
i
drink
it
slow
and
let
it
warm
and
mellow
soon
the
character
emerges
in
the
form
of
a
smooth
caramel
ruddy
malts
and
a
large
bitter
hop
contrast
at
the
end
goes
down
well
with
the
dark
finish
at
the
end
and
tastes
just
like
something
called
an
extra
strong
irish
ale
should
nice
little
beer
from
big
rock
drinkability
is
okay
a
bit
too
thick
for
my
liking
but
otherwise
fine
the
slightly
above
average
abv
limits
the
drinkabilty
overall
i
never
found
the
word
extra
in
the
title
on
the
bottle
and
i
most
certainly
didnt
find
it
in
the
bottle
i
hesitated
to
collect
this
one
from
the
cooler
and
adopt
it
but
ill
always
try
something
once
especially
as
it
was
only
1
48
so
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
whirl
and
i
did
but
i
much
preferred
it
if
i
had
left
this
bastard
orphan
alone
i
wouldnt
adopt
this
one
and
give
it
a
home
again
i
wouldnt
loose
any
sleep
if
this
irish
style
ale
traditionally
brewed
in
canada
stayed
there
clear
ambercopper
colored
liquid
with
tan
creamy
head
that
disappeared
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
aroma
of
malt
and
caramel
with
an
added
sweet
honey
smell
the
continued
carbonation
gave
it
a
nice
full
mouthfeel
as
the
beer
warmed
up
it
gave
an
even
stronger
and
fuller
flavor
matching
the
aromas
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
better
big
rock
products
a
pleasant
surprise
hope
to
experience
a
fresh
one
sometime
as
the
beer
warmed
some
the
bitter
finish
faded
and
i
started
to
enjoy
the
beer
a
bit
more
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
though
a
more
complex
taste
would
be
needed
for
it
to
stand
out
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
it
pours
amber
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
caramel
with
a
trace
of
metallic
smell
in
the
background
the
taste
also
has
notes
of
caramel
and
the
metallic
smell
carries
over
into
the
taste
hops
are
on
the
light
side
even
for
a
purportedly
irish
style
ale
its
not
particularly
interesting
but
not
offensive
either
two
was
about
the
limit
on
this
one
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
modest
head
and
excellent
lace
smells
literally
like
raisin
bread
with
rum
notes
in
the
back
the
taste
is
very
malty
with
raisin
apple
and
caramel
flavors
theres
also
a
very
present
alcohol
spiciness
even
for
this
malt
exentuated
style
i
think
this
beer
is
weak
in
the
hop
department
murphys
irish
red
for
example
is
much
drier
and
balanced
nice
subtle
carbonation
makes
a
good
mouthfeel
theres
a
strange
pixie
sticks
sweetness
in
the
finish
that
ruins
this
beers
drinkability
its
still
by
far
the
best
of
the
big
rock
offerings
i
have
tried
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
calgarys
big
rock
brewery
which
has
recently
been
made
available
in
nova
scotia
the
beer
pours
an
orangered
color
with
little
head
the
aroma
is
more
sour
than
floral
but
not
unappealing
this
beer
has
a
very
creamy
mouth
feel
its
taste
is
tart
and
sweet
almost
berrylike
initially
becoming
bitterer
near
the
finish
although
this
beer
has
seven
percent
alcohol
by
volume
the
alcohol
flavors
are
well
masked
the
alcoholic
content
is
apparent
however
with
a
slight
warming
feeling
overall
a
good
alternative
to
the
beers
to
the
run
of
the
mill
macro
or
even
national
craft
beers

very
nice
medium
bodied

quaffing

that
im
repeating
myself
but
this
ale
is

kind

nutty

boot

the
beer

and
balanced
beers
and
this
is
at
the

i
dont
know

damn
it

so
good

liked

just
nothing
dramatic
about
it
overall
this
feels
a
bit
full
on

be

of
a
dry
finish
are
hindering
the
score
overall
decent
beer
nothing
special
but
good
flavor
a
very
suitable
session
beer
because
of
its
continuously
interesting
but
mild
taste
and
fairly
light
body
i
will
drink
it
again
12oz

with

pleasant

not

for
a

i
generally
dont

for
the
mouth
is
on
the
thin
side
not
a
whole

going
on
here
no
off
or
odd
notes

not
a
lot
of
flavor
either
from
notes
tasted
march
2010
admittedly
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
not
great
even
for
the
style
definitely
drinkable
but
too
light
and
not
the
best
from
their
stable
of
beers
pours
red
with
a
medium
head
nothing
special
but
nice
enough
smells
sweet
and
a
little
corny
smells
of
adjunct
tastes
similar
with
more
sweet
adjunct
flavor
and
very
light
hops
just
okay
d
this
is
a
nicely
done
beer
i
could
sit
with
a
few
of
these
for
a
little
bit
but
the
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
deters
me
from
drinking
it
all
night
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
some
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
d
this
is
an
okay
irish
red
ale
it
is
welldone
and
worth
a
try
overall
nice
and
clean
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
earthy
hops
my
1st
from
diamond
bear
and
a
good
1
at
that
great
drinkability
not
a
bad
irish
red
picked
up
a
bottle
while
in
fayetteville
this
is
an
interesting
red
ale
im
getting
nutty
flavors
that
remind
me
more
of
an
english
brown
ale
while
this
still
looks
and
largely
tastes
like
a
redamber
hued
caramel
malt
theres
also
a
nice
tan
head
that
lasts
the
whole
beer
through
and
while
this
is
a
tasty
beer
overall
the
body
is
bit
thick
making
it
feel
more
like
the
heartier
american
red
ale
style
still
worth
a
try
for
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
a
surprisingly
yummy
little
ale
by
diamond
bear
this
beer
looks
incredible
nice
rich
red
body
topped
by
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
shows
nice
lacing
and
decent
retention
aroma
has
some
nice
caramel
notes
and
a
bit
of
hops
but
also
a
fair
amount
of
what
smells
like
corn
or
dms
and
holy
crap
its
actually
bottle
conditioned
swirling
it
a
bit
to
pick
up
just
enough
yeast
to
make
the
beer
slightly
hazed
effectively
covers
the
off
aroma
and
throws
more
of
a
bread
and
caramel
note
in
the
aroma
amazing
transformation
flavor
actually
smoothes
out
a
bit
as
well
but
it
still
has
a
slightly
skunky
adjunct
flavor
decent
bitterness
comes
through
in
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fair
drinkability
well
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
i
will
finish
the
sixer
definitely
a
step
in
the
right
direction
from
the
bmc
fizzy
yellow
beers
but
not
quite
a
leap
but
hey
its
brewed
in
arkansas
and
its
more
than
i
though
i
would
find
down
here
and
for
the
record
i
find
arkansas
to
be
a
beautiful
state
just
not
real
beer
friendly
i
drove
for
hours
from
texarkana
to
fort
smith
and
i
swear
the
entire
trip
was
through
dry
counties
so
to
find
beers
brewed
in
little
rock
was
a
real
treat
honestly
flavor
is
somewhat
light
but
dominated
by
a
caramel
malt
sweetness
faintest
hint
of
cherries
and
a
wisp
of
smoke
fairly
light
mouthfeel
with
a
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
comes
off
more
as
an
amber
ale
than
a
red
but
its
drinkable
and
inoffensive
mouthfeel
pretty
good
for
a
killian
like
irish
red
beer
but
this
had
more
flavor
and
personality
too
it
the
carbonation
helps
the
flavor
move
on
from
the
tongue
nice
enough
sliding
down
the
throat
rests
pleasantly
on
the
palate
but
i
had
a
hankering
for
a
beefier
taste
just
a
little
anyway
brown
with
copperyruby
highlights
largely
clear
there
is
just
a
whisper
of
haze
a
few
bubbles
were
noticed
in
the
liquid
they
lazily
raced
towards
the
head
which
was
beige
in
color
the
foam
reached
almost
two
fingers
in
height
before
fading
quickly
to
a
thin
cap
this
cap
lasted
awhile
but
left
the
beer
completely
before
i
removed
all
the
beer
from
by
glass
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
the
nose
has
modest
potency
but
the
most
vocal
aroma
was
toffee
very
light
sweetness
in
fact
it
is
a
little
dry
toasted
malts
with
a
slightly
earthy
undertone
finishes
the
bouquet
clean
simple
inviting
the
palate
is
pleasant
i
like
it
malt
leads
the
way
brown
alelike
roasted
malts
tasty
toffee
light
sweetness
some
earthiness
chocolate
and
at
the
finish
is
a
tickle
of
hopinduced
bitterness
throughout
the
taste
is
a
small
note
of
astringency
the
finish
is
creamy
but
dry
with
a
scotch
alelike
vibe
there
isnt
much
about
the
taste
that
says
red
ale
but
thankfully
this
beer
works
it
works
well
tasty
stuff
of
the
three
beers
ive
tried
from
diamond
bear
this
one
is
the
best
medium
in
body
maybe
a
little
bigger
the
carbonation
is
modest
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
filling
this
is
a
pleasant
quaff
id
buy
a
sixpack
and
drink
away
the
day
it
is
a
solid
uncomplicated
beer
a
good
complement
to
stews
or
chili
i
would
think
i
have
no
criticisms
about
the
taste
mouthfeel
or
drinkability
i
do
wish
the
nose
were
louder
and
richer
in
smells
oh
well
if
this
was
my
local
id
be
happy
thanks
rugger
for
the
bottle
this
is
a
solid
4
point
beer
even
if
i
am
a
little
biased
this
beer
pors
a
beautiful
amber
red
with
a
nice
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
but
looks
nice
in
the
beginning
and
then
it
seems
to
bow
out
when
it
is
time
for
the
flavours
to
shine
throught
the
smell
is
almost
belgian
like
with
a
nice
fruity
nutty
earthy
smell
the
first
sip
is
of
a
nice
sweet
and
nutty
feel
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
bold
and
it
almost
seems
to
be
on
the
heavy
sice
but
for
a
nite
cap
beer
it
fits
the
bill
very
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
i
am
glad
this
is
carried
up
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
not
the
typical
red
i
was
surprised
when
the
bartender
told
me
it
was
a
red
it
is
fruity
and
slightly
bitter
super
smooth
and
refreshing
malt
forward
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
a
great
tasting
beer
for
any
occasion
that
i
feel
even
novice
drinkers
would
enjoy
good
from
the
bottles
but
i
enjoy
these
the
most
from
my
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glasses
malty
and
smooth
no
surprise
going
on
in
this
beer
it
is
what
it
is
a
solid
red
ale
that
on
occasion
im
in
the
mood
for
and
enjoy
when
i
want
something
other
then
a
hop
bomb
this
is
an
interesting
example
of
irish
red
because
there
are
hidden
notes
of
citrus
from
american
hop
that
actually
work
quite
well
for
the
style
pours
a
gorgeous
amber
with
small
head
and
is
strong
on
the
caramel
and
malt
flavors
barely
noticeable
hops
on
the
nose
instead
heavy
malt
sweetness
caramel
and
tiny
hints
of
dark
fruit
i
tried
this
beer
while
in
san
diego
during
a
business
trip
and
really
enjoyed
it
a
smooth
quality
beer
in
which
i
enjoyed
numerous
times
both
on
draft
and
bottle
i
just
wish
you
it
was
sold
in
alabama
while
this
beer
is
not
complex
i
like
the
balanced
flavors
because
i
dont
much
care
for
forward
hop
bitterness
very
easy
to
drink
pretty
color
in
the
glass
this
could
be
a
pleasing
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
your
friends
still
stuck
drinking
the
mass
produced
american
lagers
nice
deep
copper
clear
colour
in
the
glass
head
disappeared
pretty
quickly
and
then
no
lacing
good
carbonation
and
slightly
sweet
and
caramel
like
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
with
a
palatable
level
of
sweetness
and
i
found
a
slight
drying
finish
like
iced
tea
no
strong
flavours
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
ale
that
went
down
very
easily
and
left
me
wanting
another
one
straight
away
id
buy
this
one
again
but
will
probably
buy
a
couple
of
other
red
ales
to
do
a
comparison
good
solid
irish
red
ale
nothing
in
this
beer
is
going
to
blow
your
mind
but
sometimes
a
nice
carmel
and
malty
red
ale
is
perfect
with
dinner
at
the
brewery
final
score
3
08
tried
some
in
san
diego
have
a
hard
time
finding
a
red
better
than
it
for
me
o
wellcrafted
if
not
particularly
exceptional
irish
red
more
than
decent
enjoyable
packs
almost
enough
flavor
but
lacks
any
interesting
characteristics
its
a
nice
and
malty
ale
overall
a
malty
sweet
smooth
amber
ale
with
just
a
touch
of
nuttiness
simple
and
honest
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
a
a
true
amber
ale
so
many
california
amber
ales
are
loaded
with
hops
your
coors
light
chugging
buddies
might
be
able
to
appreciate
this
beer
deep
amber
to
reddish
in
color
a
light
bit
of
white
foam
covers
a
small
bit
of
the
top
of
the
beer
light
aroma
of
caramel
and
amber
malt
theres
a
taste
of
amber
malt
with
very
little
play
from
the
hops
theres
not
much
in
the
fade
the
body
is
a
bit
light
for
my
taste
o
while
i
do
love
my
ipas
i
found
this
to
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
brew
very
easy
to
drink
poured
a
beautiful
clear
reddish
copper
ungortunately
no
head
to
speak
of
no
lacing
none
zilch
aroma
is
malty
no
hops
mouthfeel
is
ok
taste
is
seeet
malty
no
hops
not
bitter
in
the
least
little
aftertaste
the
whole
thing
is
kind
of
bland
other
than
the
great
color
this
beer
has
little
going
for
it
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
good
mainstay
at
karl
strauss
but
not
the
most
exciting
beer
still
no
complaints
bad
a
bottle
at
our
hotel
in
san
diego
pours
a
bright
deep
red
clear
with
very
small
white
head
aroma
of
cherries
caramel
sweet
sugars
plums
some
other
fruits
flavor
follows
with
big
sweet
cherries
and
fruits
sweet
sweet
caramel
body
is
medium
with
low
medium
carbonation
and
extremely
smooth
going
down
nice
sweet
finish
lingers
on
the
palate
thought
this
was
a
really
good
beer
and
went
down
incredibly
easy
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
but
very
pleasant
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
nothing
too
terrible
but
nothing
memorable
either
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
not
very
bitter
but
not
too
weak
to
me
it
actually
has
a
very
distinct
malty
flavor
and
leaves
behind
a
sweet
aftertaste
i
randomly
selected
this
brew
and
honestly
i
wasnt
the
least
disappointed
my
only
criticism
is
i
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
all
in
all
will
drink
again
o
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
and
seemed
a
little
flat
not
recommended
overall
this
is
pretty
drinkable
stuff
once
i
got
over
the
lack
of
hops
and
realised
that
this
was
a
very
determined
choice
it
was
clear
that
this
was
a
pretty
wellcrafted
brew
though
the
flavours
might
be
subtle
theyre
there
to
be
explored
i
enjoyed
it
overall
id
say
its
a
solid
red
ale
the
best
thing
i
can
say
is
that
this
beer
is
sweet
as
opposed
to
being
bitter
ive
always
disliked
beer
in
general
but
only
because
i
apparently
wasnt
drinking
the
right
beer
it
wasnt
until
i
had
a
glass
of
this
that
i
decided
beer
can
be
awesome
i
admit
i
had
no
idea
this
was
supposed
to
be
in
an
irish
red
ale
style
it
definitely
tasted
like
a
less
bittered
up
english
bitter
to
me
for
a
sd
beer
this
is
pretty
mild
on
the
hop
side
but
i
unfortunately
cannot
vouch
whether
or
not
its
authentic
to
style
as
i
have
little
experience
with
irish
beer
in
general
this
is
definitely
one
of
those
for
casual
beer
drinkers
and
for
the
rest
of
us
there
are
definitely
other
amber
ales
that
are
more
worthwhile
to
revisit
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
irish
red
just
not
my
style
if
you
are
an
irish
red
drinker
i
would
recommend
you
try
this
beer
as
its
won
some
very
prestigous
awards
for
its
example
of
the
style
o
decent
beer
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
prizewinning
beer
as
stated
on
the
label
though
feels
like
an
improved
and
slightly
more
complex
version
of
newcastle
probably
would
be
a
good
candidate
to
get
people
into
the
craft
scene
drinkability
is
ok
if
you
like
a
really
sweet
malty
ale
id
not
have
a
2nd
if
it
wasnt
the
only
craft
brew
in
the
san
diego
airport
where
i
have
a
painful
4
hour
layover
i
was
really
hoping
for
some
good
ipa
this
beer
is
everywhere
in
sd
but
i
dont
see
how
its
gotten
so
popular
or
how
it
deserves
a
gold
medal
of
any
kind
flavorful
malt
bill
and
sessionable
but
an
absolute
adjunct
and
raw
mess
on
the
finish
you
need
to
keep
quaffing
this
thing
to
keep
the
aftertaste
out
of
your
mouth
karls
seasonal
offerings
and
one
shots
are
so
much
better
ill
pass
on
this
doa
overall
really
not
a
brilliant
beer
if
you
want
a
good
caramelmaltandnutbased
beer
try
james
squires
amber
ale
much
better
built
and
cheaper
by
the
case
pours
a
semi
see
through
copper
hue
which
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
a
rim
of
lacingthe
smell
is
raisinstoffeecaramel
and
fruit
cake
very
malt
orientated
which
you
expect
for
the
style
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
a
little
light
for
me
with
tastes
of
caramel
candytoffee
maltsraisin
breadfruit
cake
and
finished
with
a
butterscotch
swseetness
and
overall
it
doesnt
look
the
greatest
but
isnt
the
worst
irish
red
out
there
and
if
fresher
could
be
something
i
try
again
o
not
a
bad
beer
this
one
nice
accompaniment
to
a
winter
meal
body
seems
pretty
watery
too
much
carbonation
o
nice
red
well
balanced
nothing
too
special
but
a
drinkable
good
showing
of
a
irish
red
overall
its
a
solid
beer
its
inexpensive
and
worth
drinking
picked
up
a
pint
at
the
san
diego
airport
before
flying
home
beer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
light
clear
red
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
to
report
in
aroma
very
average
hop
and
malt
aroma
similar
taste
some
caramel
sweetness
with
some
malty
biscuity
character
mild
hoppiness
overall
this
beer
was
about
as
average
as
you
can
go
glad
to
have
tried
it
would
not
drink
it
again
the
beer
is
very
straightforward
malty
brew
and
easy
to
drink
good
when
out
with
friends
if
youll
not
really
wanting
to
think
too
much
about
your
beer
but
could
be
more
interesting
with
a
little
more
hop
balance
o
really
pretty
boring
its
saviors
are
how
it
looks
and
how
it
feels
pass
its
a
beer
that
has
a
place
in
the
world
but
its
not
exactly
teeming
with
flavor
country
either
overall
a
pretty
nice
irish
red
ale
easydrinking
beer
with
a
maltfocused
flavor
light
caramel
sweetness
and
hints
of
mint
and
chocolate
overall
i
was
quite
disappointed
ive
had
both
their
tower
10
ipa
and
full
suit
brown
and
was
very
impressed
with
both
this
really
wasnt
up
to
that
standard
and
was
really
rather
ordinary
not
worth
having
m
surprisingly
thin
compared
to
the
taste
from
the
taste
youd
expect
a
medium
thick
palate
coating
residual
effect
but
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
price
wise
if
i

id
pick
some
up
from
time
to
time
pours
a
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
1
inch
fizzy
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
random
dots
of
lace
drip
back
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
fruit
and
a
slight
metallic
aroma
taste
is
malty
fruity
caramel
and
there
is
a
slight
metallic
flavor
just
like
the
smell
the
carbonation
on
this
beer
is
fairly
high
and
paired
with
a
somewhat
thin
body
the
mouthfeel
is
not
that
impressive
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
all
around
nothing
too
horrible
but
not
something
i
would
probably
try
again
overall
pretty
much
iconic
of
what
a
red
should
be
while
making
nothing
too
standout
karl
strauss
i
may
have
been
unimpressed
by
your
wheat
circumstances
may
have
caused
that
but
your
red
is
nothing
to
scoff
at
in
my
opinion
a
great
drink
with
the
right
meal
an
extremely
bready
red
ale
and
flavorful
enough
per
the
style
you
get
a
caramel
flav
distinct
to
the
style
with
a
lighter
lessfilling
body
and
actual
decent
hop
bitterness
im
sure
this
would
have
been
much
better
out
of
a
pint
glass
or
bottle
but
sometimes
you
have
to
go
with
what
you
have
will
give
it
another
try
and
check
the
ratings
then
medium
to
full
body
but
the
carbonation
is
a
little
bit
coarse
pretty
good
brew
here
malt
bombs
like
this
dont
tend
to
be
my
thing
but
im
really
enjoying
this
one
while
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
it
is
highly
drinkable
has
a
great
redlike
amber
color
and
smells
of
toasty
hops
with
a
tiny
hint
of
vanillacaramel
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
strauss
beers
but
its
not
exceptional
as
a
final
note
i
hope
the
people
at
karl
strauss
keep
taking
risks
as
they
have
been
trying
to
recently
theyve
been
creative
before
they
just
have
to
keep
trying
i
look
forward
to
future
efforts
from
them
but
i
wont
bother
trying
their
classic
selection
anymore
o
karl
used
to
be
on
my
top
favorite
beers
but
have
gone
on
to
bolder
beers
i
wont
knock
em
down
for
what
they
do
its
just
my
opinion
but
i
hope
they
continue
to
make
different
ones
for
us
to
try
o
i
think
that
there
is
a
strong
case
for
poor
handling
on
part
of
the
seller
for
that
reason
i
cant
really
rule
out
that
this
isnt
the
intended
state
of
this
beer
i
will
reserve
my
final
say
of
this
beer
until
i
can
confirmdebunk
the
authenticity
of
this
tasting
karl
strauss
has
consistently
made
decent
beers
and
i
wouldnt
be
shocked
if
revisiting
this
beer
would
provide
a
completely
different
tasting
experience
o
this
is
like
a
very
hunky
man
with
rippling
muscles
and
a
fabulous
car
turning
out
to
be
a
big
yawn
fest
i
loved
the
appearance
but
the
flavor
is
nothing
to
cheer
about
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
wash
something
down
with
not
enjoy
on
its
own
truly
a
pleasant
and
likeable
offering
id
be
happy
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
nice
beer
with
a
lot
of
malt
flavor
something
you
dont
see
to
much
in
california
flagships
not
much
to
say
on
this
one
its
nice
and
drinkable
but
nothing
stands
out
for
those
who
love
that
heavy
bready
alcohol
flavor
go
out
and
pick
it
up
cant
wait
to
try
ks
other
brews
stay
thirsty
my
friends
not
bad
not
great
a
perfectly
competent
irish
red
maybe
this
fills
a
need
in
the
marketing
scheme
since
i
like
most
of
the
other
strauss
beers
much
better
than
this
but
the
other
choice
was
dos
equis
at
guadalajara
in
old
town
san
diego
overall
very
good
not
sure
it
tastes
like
an
ale
but
im
a
fan
of
this
one
t
similar
to
the
smell
a
little
caramel
malt
sweetness
followed
by
a
faded
hop
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
the
malts
stand
out
a
bit
more
and
take
on
a
more
bready
character
its
one
of
the
better
karl
strauss
beers
ive
had
but
still
not
great
taste
is
sweetspicy
definite
toasty
character
very
light
pepperspicy
bitterness
with
hint
of
citrus
and
a
faint
hint
of
earth
near
the
finish
its
a
bit
boozyalcoholic
in
character
for
the
abv
and
what
appears
to
be
intended
as
an
easy
going
session
beer
all
is
a
bit
vague
and
somewhat
flat
in
character
so
although
decent
with
some
character
it
ends
up
being
neither
interesting
nor
particularly
drinkable
being
rather
bland
flat
and
heavy
for
what
it
is
for
my
own
reference
its
slightly
better
than
napa
smith
amber
but
not
much
being
somewhat
flatter
and
weaker
in
character
but
also
being
cleaner
and
less
offputting
in
aroma
or
the
like
d
nice
sessionability
easy
enough
to
drink
d
not
bad
overall
i
like
it
and
it
goes
well
with
food
a
not
too
challenging
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
in
smaller
doses
but
is
very
sweet
not
too
bad
overall
but
i
dont
think
ill
pick
this
one
up
again
d
drinkable
simple
not
the
best
but
standard
overall
barring
the
mouthfeel
red
trolley
is
pretty
much
perfect
so
much
complexity
balance
and
flavors
while
being
perfectly
fit
for
a
session
beer
its
small
wonder
its
won
the
accolades
it
has
poured
ontap
in
downtown
san
diego
at
the
columbia
street
brewpub
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
presenting
with
a
deep
amberred
color
and
a
good
thick
white
head
there
is
a
spicymalt
nose
to
the
beer
the
beer
has
a
good
fullbodied
flavor
that
is
well
balanced
malt
and
toffee
with
fruity
undertones
the
beer
is
very
full
and
robust
in
mouth
with
a
smooth
malty
finish
very
easy
to
drink
the
color
was
an
amber
when
poured
the
aromoa
was
of
a
mild
roasted
malts
and
hops
with
a
hint
of
sweet
spices
and
candy
the
taste
of
lightly
roasted
malts
and
hops
along
with
a
hint
of
caramel
was
evident
on
the
palate
nicely
balanced
and
a
pleasant
surprise
not
tart
but
a
nice
long
pleaant
finish
ive
always
loved
this
beer
and
am
suprised
to
see
it
only
have
a
b
it
is
the
perfect
winter
beer
in
my
eyes
d
red
trolley
is
and
always
has
been
what
it
is
a
malty
red
ale
with
lots
of
flavor
while
i
prefer
a
dryer
and
hoppier
beer
rt
is
solid
for
the
style
and
definitely
a
favorite
for
those
that
dont
like
bitter
beers
i
e
most
broads
pours
to
a
moderate
beige
head
and
moderate
lacing
color
is
brilliant
redamber
aroma
is
a
disappointingly
weak
caramel
malt
flavors
consist
of
a
mild
mix
of
graininess
crystal
malts
pale
malt
and
a
balancing
hop
bitterness
and
weak
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
a
bit
too
flat
pepsilike
overall
it
is
a
decent
predictable
drinking
experience
d
a
solid
red
ale
but
the
almost
over
the
top
malt
character
stops
it
from
being
really
drinkable
needs
a
bit
more
balance
overall
fair
but
not
going
to
be
added
to
my
rotation
drinkability
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
bottle
at
worst
i
dreaded
another
thin
flavorless
american
brew
but
i
was
surprised
by
its
thickness
not
too
heavy
but
i
wouldnt
have
too
many
of
these
in
a
night
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
caramel
being
the
most
prevalent
some
toast
and
some
more
of
that
mild
chocolatepeanut
butter
is
there
in
the
background
kind
of
like
mexican
mole
sauce
this
brew
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
but
not
overly
interesting
although
i
cant
deny
a
quick
malt
bomb
fix
is
nice
every
now
and
again
served
cold
and
fresh
red
trolley
ale
works
well
as
a
session
beer
d
very
easy
drinking
personally
i
think
it
needs
more
bitterness
to
offset
the
malty
base
of
this
beer
overall
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
but
its
certainly
not
a
terrible
decision
if
this
is
your
best
option
not
worth
seeking
out
but
also
not
worth
avoiding
poured
ambercopper
into
a
5oz
sampling
glass
with
a
finger
of
white
head
and
decent
carbonation
smelled
overwhelmingly
of
malt
with
some
caramel
biscuit
and
a
tiny
hint
of
chocolate
the
taste
however
was
very
onedimensionally
geared
toward
maltiness
from
start
to
finish
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
sprinkled
in
fullbodied
and
nicely
carbonated
but
not
a
session
beer
for
me
it
tastes
as
it
smells
with
caramel
being
the
first
taste
and
chocolate
second
this
is
definitely
a
dessert
drink
for
me
overall
drinkable
if
you
are
having
only
one
after
that
it
becomes
bland
and
tasteless
d
the
beer
itself
is
not
terrible
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
other
than
that
its
not
awful
the
flavors
that
are
there
arent
bad
its
just
not
necessarily
my
cup
of
tea
drinkability
as
the
temperature
cools
down
i
find
its
an
even
better
time
to
enjoy
a
warming
red
trolley
it
just
works
really
well
enjoying
one
or
two
while
watching
the
chargers
i
tend
to
drink
this
beer
slower
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
making
the
most
of
the
malts
this
is
a
beer
ive
enjoyed
over
the
years
and
i
think
it
gets
a
little
bit
better
each
time
i
have
it
or
maybe
i
appreciate
it
a
little
more
each
time
if
i
didnt
read
the
label
i
might
guess
this
was
an
oktoberfest
in
fact
if
they
upped
the
carbonation
50
it
might
make
a
good
one
as
is
its
flat
on
both
counts
5
8
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
pretty
solid
amber
ale
definitely
malt
forward
but
thats
certainly
not
a
bad
thing
after
this
one
i
think
ill
have
another
way
too
sweet
cloying
thick
mouthfeel
for
the
style
as
well
nothing
really
positive
to
say
other
than
the
fact
that
im
probably
being
too
generous
with
my
ratings
on
this
one
sorry
mister
strauss
you
have
yet
to
impress
me
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
even
at
a
baseball
game
in
a
plastic
cup
d
drinkability
is
good
the
smoothness
really
helps
out
alot
this
one
comes
across
as
a
run
of
the
mill
amber
for
the
most
part
not
bad
but
not
too
remarkable
either
overall
red
trolley
is
a
fine
example
of
what
the
microbreweries
of
san
diego
have
to
offer
while
not
as
powerful
in
comparison
to
other
seasonal
red
ales
e
g
santas
private
reserve
ale
brewed
by
rogue
ales
red
trolley
ale
deserves
praise
for
its
drinkability
it
almost
seems
like
in
a
failed
attempt
at
crafting
a
winterwarmer
karl
strauss
lucked
on
to
something
with
more
universal
appeal
the
first
thing
i
smell
is
tomato
soup
call
me
crazy
the
taste
is
slightly
malty
with
a
warm
finish
that
sticks
to
the
pallet
perfectly
carbonated
i
would
session
this
beer
trying
to
drink
all
the
local
san
diego
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
salute
the
san
diego
airport
which
of
all
the
airports
ive
been
to
in
america
has
the
best
selection
in
the
terminals
for
instance
before
catching
a
flight
in
san
yesterday
i
had
a
couple
pints
of
red
trolley
ale
nice
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
some
decent
lace
work
on
the
glass
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
but
maybe
mine
was
a
little
too
cold
to
generate
much
aroma
slight
caramel
malt
aroma
nice
rich
combination
of
caramel
malt
with
a
little
roastiness
maybe
a
little
nuttiness
and
a
slight
grassy
hops
finish
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
nice
blend
of
flavors
for
a
solid
ale
a
little
high
in
the
carbonation
which
ive
noticed
in
other
karl
stauss
brews
nice
smooth
mellow
finish
and
a
very
solid
session
beer
d
i
think
i
could
drink
this
for
a
session
beer
it
certainly
beats
the
budcoorsmiller
available
at
the
corner
store
drinkability
is
certainly
good
but
the
flavor
and
lack
of
hop
presence
makes
this
beer
less
desirable
on
tap
at
the
chilis
in
torrance
ca
aroma
has
a
hint
of
malt
not
much
hops
in
there
amber
red
with
a
small
tan
beige
head
smooth
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
in
there
caramely
and
a
little
sweet
easy
drinking
and
dry
in
the
finish
well
made
and
no
real
flaws
could
be
a
little
more
assertive
everyone
says
this
is
the
best
karl
strauss
has
to
offer
its
a
decent
beer
good
color
solid
red
with
an
offwhite
head
a
nearly
toosweet
caramel
nose
with
straw
malty
sweet
taste
to
the
point
it
feels
like
it
builds
up
on
your
teeth
lasting
finish
pretty
thin
not
remarkable
for
a
lighter
beer
i
think
the
amber
lager
is
a
much
better
alternative
poured
a
deeper
amber
color
with
a
small
sized
off
white
head
i
had
this
side
x
side
with
a
pint
of
their
oktoberfest
and
honestly
other
than
this
being
a
little
deeper
in
color
i
would
have
a
hard
time
telling
the
difference
some
caramel
toastiness
and
some
light
citrus
decent
beer
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
in
the
future
tried
this
one
on
tap
at
the
fish
market
restaurant
in
san
diego
where
it
poured
nice
and
cold
a
dark
brown
thick
and
hazy
color
with
a
fizzy
whimpy
offwhite
head
that
disappears
with
some
minor
lacing
the
aroma
suggests
malty
brown
sugar
and
grassy
wheat
the
taste
is
consistent
with
the
smell
somewhat
thin
with
minor
sweetness
and
a
pretty
forgetable
wheat
bitterness
fairly
drinkable
and
well
carbonated
for
a
refreshing
feel
but
not
something
you
really
feel
compelled
to
drink
many
of
in
my
opinion
not
the
best
of
what
i
have
tried
from
this
brewer
but
not
regrettable
either
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
it
were
just
a
little
more
hoppy
id
like
it
a
lot
more
there
is
practically
no
aroma
that
comes
of
this
beer
which
is
a
big
disappointment
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
to
it
but
a
slight
bit
less
malt
would
be
my
taste
has
a
deep
tawnycopper
color
with
a
nice
beige
head
the
aroma
is
heavily
of
roasted
malt
toffee
and
caramel
the
taste
is
of
caramel
and
some
dark
fruits
like
raisins
or
dates
pretty
sweet
wish
it
were
hoppier
it
has
a
medium
body
and
finishes
pretty
smooth
and
sweet
drinks
well
for
chain
restaurant
offering
had
on
tap
at
an
airport
bar
in
lax
poured
a
medium
amber
color
with
some
red
tint
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
and
a
touch
sweet
a
medium
bodied
amber
malts
are
nutty
and
a
touch
sweet
hops
are
slightly
spicy
there
is
a
slightly
harsh
feel
to
the
taste
in
this
beer
kind
of
a
typical
amber
drinkable
but
typical
not
very
complex
at
all
it
pours
a
medium
amber
color
into
my
glass
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
sweet
and
fruity
almost
like
candied
fruit
theres
a
trickle
of
malt
in
the
nose
too
well
so
far
its
off
to
a
good
start
but
good
starts
only
last
for
so
long
more
sugary
fruits
in
the
taste
without
much
balance
from
the
hops
and
the
malt
runs
around
on
the
palate
the
beer
is
made
to
be
sweet
according
to
the
bottle
label
but
its
a
little
cloying
in
my
opinion
worth
a
try
super
easy
on
the
taste
buds
ale
nothing
is
particularly
outstanding
here
this
is
simply
a
mild
all
purpose
ale
that
just
wants
to
be
a
beer
pretty
much
this
would
work
with
just
about
any
meal
o
this
beer
is
almost
a
nutbrownmild
on
steroids
fairly
mild
and
well
balanced
flavor
and
it
has
a
nice
little
hop
kick
a
drinkable
beer
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
basic
good
not
great
could
drink
good
amount
of
this
brew
best
of
the
karl
strauss
offerings
ive
had
though
i
havent
seen
the
stout
offered
anywhere
yet
karl
strauss
is
a
decent
organization
that
i
think
suffers
from
trying
to
please
too
many
people
being
a
brewpub
they
aim
at
appealing
to
beer
nuts
but
at
the
same
time
they
position
themselves
as
a
kind
of
beerthemed
family
restaurant
this
is
a
tricky
balance
to
acheive
and
there
is
some
overlap
in
those
two
schemes
but
beerwise
it
guides
them
to
aim
for
the
middle
this
beer
along
with
most
of
their
lineup
exemplifies
that
the
beer
is
clean
and
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
but
largely
unremarkable
it
has
some
pleasant
maltytoffee
notes
with
a
hint
of
toastyness
but
given
a
decent
hoppy
zing
it
would
have
been
considerably
more
interesting
im
not
saying
they
should
remake
arrogant
bastard
im
just
saying
that
i
would
like
this
beer
more
if
it
had
a
little
hoppy
dryness
in
the
finish
and
just
a
frisson
of
hop
perfume
in
the
nose
aiming
for
accessibility
is
one
thing
and
this
beer
is
quite
accessible
but
even
so
when
i
was
in
the
k
s
in
universal
citywalk
the
people
at
the
next
table
displayed
their
preconceptions
when
they
picked
out
the
endless
summer
light
lager
as
their
fave
saying
of
the
red
we
dont
like
those
dark
beers
the
problem
is
you
cant
please
everybody
it
looks
like
they
are
pleasing
enough
to
stay
in
business
at
any
rate
thanks
to
hoppyben
for
the
bottle
my
recent
fascination
with
red
ales
probably
gives
this
brew
more
credit
than
it
deserves
but
overall
i
thought
it
was
very
good
a
little
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
but
finishes
nice
and
smooth
the
aroma
is
perfect
for
the
style
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
i
chose
this
particular
brew
over
the
sampler
because
i
had
just
recenlty
brewed
my
own
batch
of
red
ale
and
i
gotta
say
the
red
trolley
ale
was
definately
better
than
mine
local
consideration
at
pizza
port
solena
beach
some
lace
some
yeast
noted
and
some
toasted
malt
not
all
that
bad
but
this
style
is
fairly
commonplace
and
topped
by
many
easy
drink
and
beats
a
macro
not
way
out
of
a
place
in
the
incredible
california
beer
landscape
beautiful
lacing
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
coming
up
from
the
bottom
the
entire
time
i
was
drinking
this
pint
d
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
kind
of
dull
especially
after
a
week
of
seeking
out
and
consuming
sd
style
2xipa
hop
bombs
this
is
a
pleasant
drinkable
brew
nothing
more
nothing
else
d
completely
and
absolutely
drinkable
to
me
this
is
a
session
beer
of
dreamlike
proportions
while
it
looks
nice
after
drinking
it
for
just
a
short
while
you
realize
that
its
no
good
the
taste
is
the
main
problem
theres
a
horribly
sweet
taste
and
a
somewhat
bitter
taste
all
at
once
and
it
turns
out
less
than
good
in
fact
it
tastes
quite
bad
i
might
be
willing
to
try
this
on
tap
theres
a
karl
strauss
across
from
my
office
but
i
certainly
wont
get
this
again
at
the
store
medium
amber
red
color
with
a
medium
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
not
much
aroma
here
a
bit
of
fruityness
and
caramel
taste
is
quite
sweet
but
i
like
it
lots
of
toffee
with
a
caramelized
strawberry
flavor
on
top
not
much
in
the
hop
dept
a
bit
of
a
creamy
body
slight
sour
notes
from
the
yeast
finish
is
a
bit
sticky
and
this
could
definitely
be
cloying
after
a
few
i
only
had
one
and
it
went
fast
but
i
am
satisfied
and
want
some
more
hops
one
was
plenty
not
impressed
yuck
cheers
overall
this
is
a
decent
if
mostly
average
amber
ale
if
i
lived
near
the
san
diego
area
id
probably
drink
this
every
once
in
a
while
finally
thanks
mom
for
bringing
back
a
mixed
sixpack
from
california
for
your
favorite
beer
geek
this
is
a
decent
offering
from
karl
strauss
and
will
definantly
appeal
to
the
maltheads
out
there
the
beer
poures
a
deep
amberred
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
left
nice
lace
down
my
glass
the
smell
was
interesting
and
made
up
of
a
very
light
doppelbock
type
scent
the
taste
was
nothing
as
intriguing
as
the
scent
but
quite
plesent
the
beer
had
a
nice
malt
flavor
to
it
and
was
quite
sweet
with
a
definant
caramel
aftertaste
like
i
said
lovers
of
malt
will
go
for
this
beer
but
the
taste
is
a
little
too
one
dimentonal
for
me
ill
stick
with
my
previous
rating
this
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
biscuity
malt
so
this
is
a
big
big
step
up
from
macroswill
hop
bite
is
mild
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
fruitiness
between
the
hops
and
esters
sweet
raisins
sampled
at
disneylnads
california
park
this
was
a
very
attractive
looking
beer
with
a
darker
color
and
a
smallish
head
laced
pretty
well
smell
was
a
very
enjoyable
sweet
and
tangy
blend
easy
to
drink
the
taste
could
have
used
a
little
bit
of
improvement
it
didnt
taste
bad
but
at
the
same
time
there
really
wasnt
too
much
to
remember
it
buy
if
only
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looked
and
smelled
this
would
be
a
truly
great
beer
medium
amber
color
medium
head
aroma
is
malty
and
a
touch
sweet
a
medium
bodied
amber
malts
are
nutty
and
a
touch

hops
are
slightly
spicy
there
is
a
slightly
harsh
feel
to
the

in
this
beer
kind
of
a
typical

i
am
writing
this
review
form
my
notes
boring
there
is
nothing
outstanding
or
bad
about
this
beer
like
all
karl
strauss
offerings
in
my
opinion
it
is
sufficiently
benign
not
to
offend
the
mass
market
there
are
many
better
beers
available
got
this
on
draught
at
the
uva
cafe
in
downtown
disney
after
pretty
much
giving
up
on
finding
any
decent
beer
in
the
disney
parks
pretty
amber
color
with
a
medium
beige
head
nice
malty
aroma
balanced
with
a
faint
whiff
of
hops
flavor
is
nicely
balanced
sweet
malt
and
hops
with
a
light
hoppy
finish
worth
seeking
out
if
you
are
at
disney
and
are
sick
of
only
finding
bud
served
in
a
mug
i
love
the
color
and
the
foam
this
beer
provides
its
a
rich
coppery
color
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
isnt
much
of
anything
just
a
slight
malt
the
taste
is
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
roasted
grains
smooth
with
some
depth
of
flavor
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
only
a
slight
bitter
hop
finish
this
is
a
very
good
ale
nice
irish
ale
with
the
quality
that
has
come
to
be
expected
from
boulevard
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
traditional
irish
ales
im
really
glad
i
went
for
this
instead
of
one
of
the
massmarket
ones
smithwicks
is
probably
the
best
of
the
lot
but
not
as
good
as
this
at
this
time
of
year
nice
color
lots
of
lacing
big
head
just
a
really
nice
looking
beer
that
tastes
great
one
of
boulevards
better
beers
for
sure
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
an
irish
red
has
the
toasty
caramel
malt
presence
you
expect
with
a
wee
bit
of
roast
o
a
very
wellmade
version
of
irish
red
just
not
a
lot
of
character
throughout
but
the
cleanness
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
profiles
are
impressive
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
i
liked
it
a
lot
and
would
gladly
buy
more
nice
copperrusty
color
floral
and
slightly
hoppy
taste
a
tad
malty
and
a
little
sweet
i
always
expect
it
to
be
better
and
am
always
let
down
pours
slightly
hazy
light
brown
tinted
amber
under
a
2
offwhite
persistent
foam
cap
has
a
clean
malt
driven
aroma
with
caramel
and
bread
crust
a
light
caramel
sweetness
on
the
introduction
dries
out
with
a
light
roast
and
grainy
finish
medium
body
and
moderate
to
moderately
high
carbonation
which
seems
a
little
high
and
washes
out
some
of
the
malt
flavors
another
solid
standard
from
boulevard
crisp
full
bodied
goodness
this
is
the
one
beer
from
boulevard
that
i
wont
buy
if
you
hand
me
one
i
will
drink
it
though
i
am
at
odds
with
many
of
my
friends
who
love
this
beer
though
guys
who
wish
they
could
get
it
year
round
the
yeast
aroma
is
too
strong
im
not
sure
why
it
is
more
pronounced
in
this
beer
when
compared
to
other
irish
style
red
ales
though
overall
not
bad
but
not
the
best
showing
from
boulevard
overall

may
not
pick
this
one
up
again
but
it
is
a
respectable
amber
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
a
cheap
price
pours
well
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
head
is
nice
and
thick
taking
a
while
to
settle
it
is
not
a
very
sweet
irish
ale
it
is
a
malty
ale
with
a
somewhat
bitter
finish
this
is
a
full
flavoured
beer
that
is
neither
overly
filling
or
too
complex
this
is
a
great
beer
from
bottle
or
tap
overall
this
is
an
above
average
but
not
outstanding
offering
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brownish
red
amber
with
a
two
finger
light
khaki
head
that
seemed
fizzy
during
the
pour
but
had
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
malt
dark
stone
fruit
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
flavor
is
biscuit
malt
with
a
light
toastiness
earthy
finishes
with
a
mildly
astringent
dry
grassy
hop
bitterness
with
dry
biscuit
malt
medium
bodied
with
light
creaminess
a
nice
domestic
take
on
an
irish
red
ale
covers
all
the
bases
for
the
red
profile
with
a
nice
lightly
toasty
maltiness
and
a
dry
almost
tannic
finishing
bitterness
pleasant
mouth
feel
o
i
think
that
bottle
conditioning
adds
a
bit
of
complexity
to
this
one
very
drinkable
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
like
where
they
were
going
with
this
i
just
wish
they
wouldve
taken
it
ever
so
slightly
farther
flavor
just
lacks
a
little
punch
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fluffy
however
you
could
probably
pound
these
on
st
patricks
day
and
not
turn
into
a
complete
mess
before
noon
if
you
were
so
inclined
overall
though
i
like
this
better
than
a
lot
of
your
more
mainstream
irish
ales
seasonal
so
get
it
while
its
out
if
it
had
more
alcohol
and
hops
i
would
rate
it
higher
but
it
is
priced
right
for
its
value
i
had
six
pints
yesterday
and
did
not
become
overly
attracted
to
ugly
women
my
head
felt
ok
this
morning
and
i
made
it
through
the
day
without
being
too
irritable
solid
but
not
must
have
and
me
purposefully
without
some
corned
beef
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
sunset
amberruby
topped
by
a
finger
of
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
rich
caramel
a
hint
of
roast
and
a
healthy
smattering
of
earthy
almost
mossy
greens
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
hearty
balance
maintained
for
most
of
the
proceedings
things
topple
a
bit
in
the
end
though
as
the
greens
puncture
through
with
a
mild
wave
of
soilladen
grassy
bitterness
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
little
red
lass
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
yet
another
solid
offering
from
boulevard

oa

usually
not

this

alot
of

its
pretty
damn
good
all
in

a
very
enjoyable
ale
nice
with
some
corned

and
cabbage
overall
i
think
this
beer
has
a
good
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
the
carbonation
brightens
it
and
it
has
a
great
reddishbrown
color
all
in
all
a
beautifully
balanced
brew
that
is
6
pack
worthy
for
sure
do
you
ever
just
crave
a
nice
hop
and
malt
balance
where
one
does
not
over
power
the
other
if
so
then
this
is
your
ticket
very
nice
brew
c
o
a
splendid
offering
from
boulevard
one
of
the
better
and
more
balanced
red
ales
ive
tried
beer
is
a
little
applelike
in
the
mouth
a
mild
roast
on
the
end
very
subtle
a
mild
bitterness
a
nice
medium
bodied
the
finish
is
nice
as
well
id
have
it
again
its
very
drinkable
with
no
alcoholic
taste
but
its
nothing
outstanding
o
goid
tasting
beer
that
is
well
balanced
a
great
st
pattys
day
beverage
not
my
most
favorite
irish
red
but
a
solid
one
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
at
best
but
not
one
of
boulevards
best
overall
its
simple
yet
inoffensive
in
taste
and
its
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
that
plays
it
safe
doesnt
take
any
chances
and
succeeds
in
doing
just
that
a
very
drinkable
irish
ale
yet
another
beer
from
boulevard
that
ive
enjoyed
and
want
again
o
after
the
last
few
boulevards
i
had
in
the
twelve
pack
sampler
i
was
having
some
doubts
this
irish
ale
though
is
quite
good
would
buy
it
again
m
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
my
tastes
mouth
has
decent
heft
there
is
nothing
bad
here
but
nothing
that
exciting
either
boulevard
irish
red
pours
a
light
shade
of
mahogany
with
a
halfinch
of
off
white
head
that
provides
spotty
yet
sticky
lace
sweet
malt
caramel
and
some
herbal
hops
are
noticeable
in
the
nose
with
the
slightest
hints
of
roasted
malt
discernible
as
well
the
flavors
of
this
brew
closely
follow
the
nose
with
the
sweet
malt
dominating
the
pallet
out
front
hints
of
caramel
and
toffee
poking
through
and
a
long
sustained
finish
with
a
touch
of
floral
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
in
the
end
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
is
met
with
a
mediumhigh
body
another
wonderful
example
of
the
irish
red
ale
category
o
a
solid
irish
red
nice
malty
flavors
with
a
subtle
hop
finish
not
overly
complex
but
easily
drinkable
o
i
initially
has
this
beer
pegged
around
a
3
but
it
built
on
me
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
nor
a
beer
i
would
regularly
reach
for
but
was
enjoyable
enough
for
what
it
was
do
this
balanced
ale
is
safe
but
respectable
able
to
cultivate
midrange
flavor
qualities
that
seem
to
find
some
new
territory
between
that
of
the
amber
and
brown
ales
while
the
smell
is
representative
of
the
flavor
it
seems
like
a
less
interesting
version
of
what
greets
the
palate
it
should
pair
well
with
most
savory
foods
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinker
nice
to
have
on
hand
to
compliment
any
kind
st
patricks
day
celebration
another
well
balanced
beer
from
boulevard
not
a
huge
irish
red
fan
but
this
one
is
really
nice
and
a
bit
different
from
the
conventional
pours
a
nice
ruby
hue
with
a
massive
fluffy
tan
head
smell
is
red
malts
and
dried
fruit
maybe
cherries
or
plums
or
something
just
barely
some
residual
sugar
taste
too
has
some
fruit
in
it
even
more
than
the
nose
mostly
featuring
the
malt
here
but
some
sappy
hops
come
in
near
the
middle
nice
malty
finish
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
of
a
yeastytart
aftertaste
maybe
from
the
bottle
conditioning
that
i
think
isnt
perfectly
congruent
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
a
very
drinkable
red
ale
with
just
enough
abv
for
the
spring
days
that
still
have
some
chill
in
the
air
another
worthy
boulevard
brew
pours
a
rusty
brown
with
a
quilt
of
light
latte
foam
and
excellent
clarity
spotty
lace
nose
is
of
floral
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
caramel
some
tea
like
earthy
hops
metallic
flavor
over
a
decent
amount
of
sweet
malts
there
is
a
certain
dry
tart
character
im
not
really
digging
medium
bodied
with
moderately
hi
carb
and
a
good
dry
finish
this
is
okay
nothing
more
i
appreciate
the
balance
struck
on
this
beer
its
rich
and
malty
yet
has
a
nice
bitterness
that
cuts
through
the
malt
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
d
a
nice
little
beer
with
a
wealth
of
malty
flavors
a
bit
too
malty
for
my
tastes
with
really
no
other
noticeable
flavors
o
pretty
darn
good
as
far
as
im
concerned
i
wouldnt
drink
this
year
round
but
for
st
pattys
day
ill
be
knocking
back
a
few
every
year
conclusion
looks
good
smells
good
feels
good
but
this
bottle
falls
a
little
short
in
the
taste
department
i
imagine
this
is
a
hard
style
to
get
just
right
because
it
includes
subtlety
but
this
is
a
good
beer
all
the
same
it
just
doesnt
shine
out
as
world
class
overall
this
brew
will
get
away
from
you
quick
i
started
the
night
with
one
and
have
had
a
whole
bunch
since
then
it
is
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
bad
boys
and
not
really
pay
it
much
mind
an
excellent
brew
i
really
liked
it
recommended
especially
for
the
springst
patricks
daymarch
timeframe
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
decent
irish
red
but
again
with
all
of
boulevards
beers
theres
just
too
much
carbonation
i
think
when
you
pour
the
beer
the
head
blossoms
as
if
youre
pouring
it
into
a
chilled
mug
not
good
but
its
well
balanced
with
malts
and
hops
and
i
do
like
this
beer
but
its
not
perfect
o
this
just
isnt
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
irish
red
ales
are
really
hard
to
perfect
and
this
one
has
a
lot
of
flaws
that
need
to
be
worked
out
i
picked
this
one
up
a
while
back
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
poured
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
good
beige
head
aromas
of
grassy
hops
toasted
malts
and
caramel
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
caramel
grassy
hops
and
toasted
malts

in
a

foamy
metal
raw
hop
and
cereal
malt
flavor
probably
one
of
my
top
12oz
seasonal
offerings
from
boulevard
o
the
hops
are
a
bit
stronger
than
the
malt
but
both
are
a
bit
soft
and
there
is
not
a
lot
of
depth
in
the
beer
but
it
has
some
nice
flavors
and
is
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
far
more
astringent
than
id
expect
from
an
irish
red
its
a
little
too
obviously
hopped
it
tastes
sweet
enough
and
there
are
some
toasty
characteristics
but
im
displeased
with
how
much
they
are
masked
by
the
excessive
hops
the
toasty
and
sweet
malt
profile
should
be
allowed
to
shine
i
really
think
that
sam
adams
does
a
better
job
of
the
irish
red
im
going
to
have
to
say
this
is
average
o
ill
be
honest
im
not
much
on
the
style
but
i
tried
to
grade
by
style
and
this
is
quite
a
good
little
beer
both
within
style
and
in
general
overall
this
is
a
nice
irish
red
the
acidity
in
the
finish
is
the
only
detractor
here
drunkability
this
beer
is
fairly
tasty
if
today
was
st
pats
day
i
would
definitely
get
drunk
off
this
brew
i
got
this
beer
in
a
boulevard
sampler
pack
and
it
was
the
seasonal
selection
bought
in
clinton
ia
very
reasonable
priced
a
very
average
beer
o
a
good
beer
for
dinner
with
some
pot
pie
or
a
burger
my
choice
i
enjoyed
it
and
it
disappeared
faster
than
i
hoped
which
means
they
did
something
right
for
sure
top
of
the
evening
to
ya
its
st
pats
and
what
a
perfect
reason
to
taste
the
wonderful
pot
of
gold
known
as
boulevards
irish
ale
thsi
beer
is
very
good
better
than
killians
this
beer
is
a
nice
clear
ruby
red
with
thin
white
head
with
slight
lacing
the
taste
is
agreat
balance
of
malt
and
a
lil
something
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
great
and
i
could
session
this
bad
boy
this
one
seems
to
be
getting
slightly
dumbed
down
over
the
years
still
drinkable
and
flavorful
compared
to
harp
guinness
and
some
of
the
big
name
irish
reds
but
past
years
seemed
to
offer
a
touch
of
roast
and
more
in
the
way
of
hops
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
boulevards
irish
ale
pours
a
very
nice
dark
red
color
perfect
for
the
style
a
tan
head
emerges
but
quickly
dissolves
head
retention
is
below
average
the
beer
leaves
slightly
above
average
amounts
of
lacing
aroma
is
not
great
only
slightly
malty
with
just
an
ever
so
slight
hint
of
caramel
the
beer
is
very
malty
and
tastes
much
better
then
it
smells
the
toasted
malt
flavor
dominates
and
it
finishes
smooth
the
beer
is
slightly
sweet
and
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
for
a
irish
red
and
it
i
give
it
high
marks
for
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
irish
red
style
if
it
had
a
little
more
aroma
it
would
have
very
high
marks
overall
this
could
be
the
consummate
session
beer
flavors
are
light
well
balanced
and
refreshing
the
price
is
very
reasonable
at
around
6
dollars
a
six
pack
also
i
can
get
this
for
around
3
dollars
a
pint
at
the
local
watering
hole
nothing
exceptional
but
a
great
goto
that
never
lets
meor
leaves
me
down
ample
amounts
of
carbonation
and
quite
dry
a
somewhat
complex
beer
for
a
lighter
abv
profile
the
beer
was
a
copper
marroon
color
with
a
thick
rocky
offwhite
head
it
has
an
earthy
dirt
smell
along
with
some
toasted
caramel
malt
when
you
take
a
sip
there
is
a
slight
bite
on
the
tongue
that
smoothes
over
with
some
roasty
malt
flavors
and
herbal
hops
there
is
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
it
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
beer
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
flavor
makes
it
enjoyable
well

not
something
i
would
try
again
to
be

not

just
underwhelming

this
was
a
malty
and
somewhat
sweet

a
smooth

be
picked
up

in

the

its
a

from
one

the
best

in

a
good
beer
to
drink
while
relaxing
o
while
not
exactly
as
i
remember
irish
ale
is
a
solid
seasonal
from
my
local
guy
boulevard
if
they
could
just
ramp
it
up
to
like
a
7
or
8
on
the
volume
knob
its
like
a
5
right
now
i
would
enjoy
it
more
that
being
said
its
worth
a
try
and
i
will
probably
buy
another
sixer
or
two
this
year
a
very

this
irish
red
ale
fits
the
style
description
perfectly
in
my
mind
this
style
is
far
from
my
first
choice
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
and
will
probably
pick
up
a
sixer
pours
a
brownred
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
average
carbonation
and
clarity
smells
sweet
and
malty
but
no
sweatness
in
the
taste
the
toasted
malt
taste
is
accompanied
by
a
surprising
taste
of
alcohol
other
than
that
im
not
tasting
much
of
anything
the
beer
isnt
very
full
its
a
little
watery
the
combination
of
the
toasted
malt
and
the
alcohol
leaves
this
beer
quite
dry
as
with
most
boulevard
offerings
its
not
bad
but
not
great
this
beer
varies
year
to
year
some
years
its
good
other
years
its
outstanding
this
one
leans
toward
outstanding
to
me
it
could
probably
handle
a
bit
more
bite
from
the
roasted
malts
but
as
it
is
its
very
very
good
and
well
worth
finding
great
job
by
a
great
brewery
also
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
johnnys
tavern
during
the
chiefs
playoff
game
this
is
a
good
beer
nice
dark
red
color
almost
black
when
not
in
the
light
the
look
of
this
beer
is
amazing
i
love
a
beer
with
deep
color
and
character
the
smell
is
nice
with
alot
of
malt
and
a
little
bread
lots
of
lacing
on
the

the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
amazing
a
nice

drinkability

is

ive
really
wanted
to
like
boulevards
brews
but
i
havent
been
able
to
find
any
thus

that
i
like
this

be

some

would
be
liked

irishamerican

with

bitterness
d
easily
drinkable
flavorful
balanced
and
moderate
abv
ive
got
to
say
that
this
was
definitely
one
of
the
better
irish
reds
that
ive
had
in
a
while
lots
of
robust
malt
flavors
with
just
the
right
amount
of
earthy
hops
providing
balance
plus
the
feel
and
drinkibility
on
this
were
great
for
nearly
6
maybe
not
entirely
true
to
the
sytle
with
all
of
the
hops
involved
but
i
was
still
impressed
by
this
boulevard
offering
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
large
offwhite
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
settles
to
a
thin
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
different
from
most
irish
reds
more
hoppy
than
malty
a
large
dose
of
citrus
and
spicy
hops
before
the
malt
underneath
can
be
detected
the
hops
also
play
a
large
role
in
the
flavor
almost
has
a
german
pilsener
hop
charactor
the
typical
caramel
malt
flavor
comes
in
after
the
initial
hop
flavor
bittersweet
is
a
perfect
discriptor
for
the
taste
the
body
feels
a
little
light
which
is
not
surprising
considering
the
malt
profile
atypical
for
the
style
but
it
might
appeal
more
drinkers
because
of
the
hops
very
nice
example
of
the
style
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
and
theres
enough
in
the
taste
to
make
it
interesting
worth
checking
out
glad
i
tried
it
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
good
head
the
smell
is
that
of
grain
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
crisp
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
the
body
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
is
an
enjoyable
beer
for
kicking
back
cheers
drinks
wellsessionable
especially
on
this
murky
spring
taste
in
the
midwest
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
overall
irish
red
i
could
have
several
especially
at
the
2
happy
hour
draft
price
this
is
a
very
fine
example
of
an
irish
ale
just
perfect
for
st
patricks
day
or
really
any
other
day
you
have
corned
beef
or
soda
bread
or
pizza
for
that
matter
this
irish
ale
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
shouldnt
offend
or
demand
attention
just
an
easy
drinker
and
wonderful
at
that
m
d
delicious
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
light

that
balances
well
with
the
flavors
very
drinkable
with

from
blvd
drinkability
would
be
better
if
the
finish
was
more
balanced
otherwise
a
good
session
beer
a
deep
amber
color
is
poured
with
touches
of
ruby
red
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
quarter
inch
thick
beige
to
light
beige
color
head
forms
on
top
the
head
dissolves
away
quickly
leaving
some
traces
of
lacing
to
become
thin
film
on
top
the
sweetness
of
malt
along
with
cracked
grain
bread
and
biscuit
are
the
main
fragrances
the
malt
also
dominates
the
taste
as
well
with
a
hearty
bread
flavor
with
the
addition
of
sweet
caramel
a
biscuit
flavor
develops
towards
the
end
it
finishes
with
a
mild
grassy
bitterness
a
light
and
watery
feel
grows
to
become
more
medium
bodied
halfway
across
the
palate
the
foaming
sensation
of
carbonation
come
out
cleanses
the
back
of
the
palate
this
may
the
closest
beer
to
this
style
i
have
had
yet
the
strong
malt
scent
and
flavor
is
spot
on
with
the
classic
color
and
soft
feel
makes
me
crave
some
bangers
and
mash
to
have
this
beer
very
hop
forward
for
the
style
and
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
body
lots
of
dry
earthy
bitterness
with
some
dry
sticky
pine
along
with
some
sweet
citrus
notes
there
is
a
nice
slightly
toasty
caramel
malt
backbone
that
provides
some
balance
with
hints
of
toffee
nut
and
biscuit
although
there
is
some
decent
balance
this
beer
is
very
very
dry
and
is
dominated
by
the
bitter
piny
hops
not
much
like
an
irish
ale
at
all
really
but
is
still
pretty
tasty
long
dry
bitter
hoppy
finish
had
on
tap
at
old
chicago
in
uptown
in
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
auburn
brown
with
a
little
head
bot
with
a
nice
beige
ring
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
the
smell
was
was
caramel
toast
some
roasted
toffee
a
little
coffee
and
some
earthy
peat
smells
almost
that
of
a
winter
warmer
the
taste
was
the
same
it
was
a
roasted
malt
and
oat
taste
with
some
caramel
and
bitter
hops
the
moth
feel
medium
with
a
slightly
bitter
taste
overall
a
good
drinking
beer
for
late
winter
early
spring
i
liked
it
i
was
quite
curious
to
see
what
boulevard
could
do
with
an
irish
red
ale
after
drinking
their
winter
seasonal
nutcracker
i
must
say
i
am
impressed
because
while
this
is
not
an
explosive
beer
by
any
means
it
is
very
full
of
flavor
and
to
me
very
pleasing
sitting
down
with
this
would
be
a
pleasure
and
this
is
not
a
style
that
piques
my
interest
easily
the
affordability
is
also
appreciated
better
than
sam
adams
irish
red
for
my
money
first
boulevard
brew
for
me

slainte
very

overall
this
is

isnt
one
of
my
favorites
and
to
those
who
accuse
me
of
not
reviewing
to
style
ha
d
goes
down
smoothly
but
and
i
cant
believe
i
am
about
to
say
this
maybe
a
little
bit
over
the
top
on
bittering
hops
i
would
also
like
a
little
more
on
the

thanks
lane
d
very

wish
i
had
more
of
this
this
is
neither
the
best
beer
in
the
world
nor
one
of
the
most
complex
its
probably
not
a
beer
people
are
going
to
be
clamoring
for
throughout
the
country
however
i
think
it
is
very
solid
in
aroma
taste
and
drinkability
overall
i
liked
this
beer
it
has
a
sweet
malty
aroma
there
is
not
much
for
hops
it
has
a
dark
amber
body
with
a
little
bit
of
a
red
hue
the
head
was
very
impressive
it
had
a
tan
head
that
was
very
bubbly
as
well
as
the
lace
it
has
a
malty
and
fruity
flavor
with
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
the
body
was
just
right
for
the
style
d
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
from
boulevard
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
it
is
sweet
but
its
is
a
round
sweetness
that
makes
this
really
smooth
the
aroma
did
not
stand
out
to
me
in
any
way
the
flavor
is
not
complicated
it
is
just
enough
to
make
it
quite
enjoyable
i
think
it
would
be
good
with
crackers
salty
cheese
and
nuts
the
color
in
this
beer
is
nice
a
deep
amber
with
enough
red
that
it
could
advertise
it
hop
flavor
is
in
proportion
for
the
style

d
pretty
smooth
beer
with
good
balance
and
decent
flavor
a
very
drinkable
session
beer
wish
i
could
regularly
get
boulevard
here
in
michigan
d
not
being
a
big
fan
of
irish
reds
this
has
a
decent
taste
nothing
complex
just
a
straightforward
ale
not
bad
but
still
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
several
of
in
one
night
mouthfeel
is
crisp
due
to
a
mediumhigh
amount
of
carbonation
flavor
is
pretty
muted
and
tame
a
very
malty
brew
definite

low
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer

mild

recommend
my
first
boulevard
and
although
thie
iris
ale
is
not
my
choice
in
sytle
im
impressed
with
blvd
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
a
deep
reddishbrown
with
light
tan
foamy
head
that
crowns
just
over
the
top
of
the
glass
as
soon
as
it
starts
pouring
you
get
a
strong
smell
of
malts
upon
further
smelling
i
get
mostly
roasted
malt
with
a
scent
lingering
on
the
end
that
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
beer
taste
is
malt
malt
malt
definitely
a
malt
bomb
but
a
good
one
biscuity
malt
flavor
coats
every
inch
of
the
tongue
with
this
beer
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
very
dry
finish
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
session
and
i
do
so
every
year
when
it
comes
out
another
beer
that
shows
boulevard
is
one
of
the
most
consistent
solid
brewerys
around
deasy
to
drink
not
sure
its
somethin
i
would
pick
up
alot
but
once
a
year
or
so
or
if
there
was
somewhere
i
could
grab
it
on
tap
its
very
solid
the
color
borders
on
dark
amberlight
red
and
had
12
finger
of
head
it
has
a
nice
malty
flavor
with
very
slight
twang
that
makes
it
a
bit
interesting
goes
down
good
and
the
flavor
lingers
just
long
enough
to
be
enjoyed
i
like
it
this
beer
is
okay
it
just
seems
to
get
an
eh
overall
it
needed
a
little
more
bite
but
otherwise
decently
inconspicuous
for
the
style
goes
well
with
grey
meat
olivecolored
drapes
p
i
really
like
this
a
good
flavor
and
an
easy
beer
to
quaff
something
i
would
recommend
and
purchase
again
in
my
opinion
irish
ale
is
the
best
of
boulevards
seasonal
beers
overall
i
think
this
beer
was
brought
in
for
the
upcoming
st
patricks
day
festivities
as
the
bar
i
had
it
at
is
right
in
the
heart
of
the
dallas
parade
route
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
for
me
that
makes
it
good
smooth

with
a
great

and
no

slight

slightly

the

are

lightly
sweet
with

its

not
sure
where
you
are
getting
the

even
another

has

for
this

at

please
look
into
this
cheers
overall
impression
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
one
is
better
enjoyed
straight
from
the
bottle
it
makes
a
decent
session
beer
when
it
opens
up
the
aroma
is
less
than
pleasant
a
nice
session
brew
that
can
complement
a
wide
variety
of
foods
bitterness
is
on
the
high
side
for
an
irish
red
da
very
sessionable
brew
i
drank
a
few
of
these
last
weekend
and
was
quite
pleased
again
tonight
pleased
with
this
brew
d
its
not
really
filling
and
has
a
smooth
enough
taste
that
makes
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
the
fairly
low
abv
makes
it
possible
to
drink
alot
of
these
certainly
would
be
nice
if
one
could
enter
an
irish
pub
and
enjoy
one
or
two
of
these
on
homebrewer
on
the
tour

and
then
some

the
roasted

dominates
the
finish
which
is
also
slightly
dry
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
norm
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
kind
of
a
dark
red
and
brown
color
it
had
about
a
one
finger
head
that
disappeared
rather
fast
leaving
very
little
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
caramel
smelling
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
very
sweet
and
has
a
a
kind
of
tea
taste
to
it
not
bad
at
all
and
fairly
drinkable
especially
with
a
fairly
low
abv
its
not
a
style
i
drink
a
lot
but
i
definitely
could
drink
this
pretty
easily
md
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
just
ok
nice
carbonation
but
overall
nothing
too
outstanding
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
for
session
drinking

good

of
an
irish
ale

of
these

again

is
good

enjoyable

very

easy

could
see
buying
this
again
for
a
session

wouldnt
replace
my
favorite
red
but
is
a
nice
change
conclusion
samuel
adams
irish
red
may
claim
to
be
a
bit
hoppier
that
typical
for
the
style
boulevards
is
even
more
so
its
got
a
decent
kick
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
along
with
nice
herbal
hop
flavors
and
a
touch
of
roastiness
that
makes
this
quite
tasty
pours
a
deep
reddishamber
colour
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
leave
a
few
small
bubbles
i
probably
shouldnt
be
reviewing
any
beers
during
the
height
of
cedar
pollen
season
but
even
though
im
pretty
bunged
up
today
im
still
getting
a
good
nose
off
this
beer
plenty
of
hops
a
bit
of
spice
and
some
yeasty
breadiness
once
in
the
mouth
theres
a
nice
balance
of
maltiness
but
the
hops
are
still
to
the
fore
full
bodied
but
a
little
overcarbonated
i
feel
even
so
id
go
back
to
the
bar
for
another
one
of
these
what
can
i
say
another
good
seasonal
brew
from
boulevard
dark
reddishbrown
in
color
with
a
slightly
less
than
onefinger
tan
head
that
really
never
fades
completely
only
shrinking
a
bit
and
leaving
a
thin
lace
behind
smells
malty
and
slightly
spicy
with
a
hint
of
wet
grass
in
the
background
tastes
big
on
the
caramel
malts
with
an
undercurrent
of
bubblegum
and
a
slight
hint
of
hops
in
the
very
back
goes
down
on
the
dry
side
and
is
fairly
carbonated
with
a
pure
medium
mouthfeel
tasty
brew
here
of
a
style
that
can
end
up
a
little
weak
sometimes
liking
this
one
notes
this
really
reminds
me
of
fat
tire
taste
is
toasted
malt
hints
of
molasses
and
a
hint
of
citrus
overall
this
is
a
good
irish
style
beer
by
boulevard
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
the
body
is
medium
to
light
i
am
drinking
an
irish
ale
right
now
it
is
an
irish
red
brewed
by
my
friendly
neighborhood
brewer
boulevard
i
love
the
irish
ale
i
even
love
the
celticish
label
it
pours
a
deep
reddishcaramel
color
with
a
decent
foamy
head
that
settles
into
lacing
for
the
entire
beer
it
smells
like
sweet
caramel
a
little
bready
and
malty
and
a
bit
fruity
the
taste
is
also
caramel
malts
and
sweet
but
has
some
nuttiness
and
a
tiny
hint
of
hops
the
body
is
fairly
light
and
sparsely
carbonated
and
basically
i
love
this
beer
not
one
i
would
look
after
might
try
on
tap
local
i
could
put
down
a
pitcher
of
this
and
not
be
sad
d
session
beer
think
this
is
above
average
irish
red
drank
pretty
good
the
dryness
would
get
to
me
after
a
while
a
passable
irish
red
bottle
conditioned
so
may
be
better
a
bit
fresher

tim
i
look
forward
to
this
ale
all
year
long
i
have
to
get
my
fill
because
after
spring
zon
comes
out
and
im
not
a
fan
d
drinks
nice
and
tasty
yet
light
a
session
beer
anyone
i
had
to
work
late
on
st
patricks
day
so
i
had
two
of
these
when
i
got
home
from
work
poured
a
copperred
color
there
wasnt
much
of
a
smell
but
what
smell
there
was
came
across
as
malty
the
taste
was
malty
with
only
a
slight
amount
of
hops
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
irish
red
ales
but
this
one
tasted
good
to
me
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
nice
deep
red
color
with
decent
foam
smell
was
a
little
funky
toasty
malts
but
also
picked
up
a
mossy
overly
earthy
smell
too
sweet
bready
taste
but
what
really
does
it
for
me
is
the
hint
of
citrus
and
bitterness
from
the
hops
to
go
along
with
the
malt
flavors
nice
job
a
nice
pour
from
the
bottle
produced
a
frothy
creamcolored
head
settled
on
a
dark
amber
body
not
much
aroma
from
this
just
some
malt
taste
is
of
semisweet
malt
with
some
light
hoppiness
in
the
finish
and
a
bit
of
a
toasted
flavor
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
is
simple
in
style
and
very
drinkable
a
nice
beer
definitely
a
good
st
patricks
day
choice
far
exceeding
the
traditional
brews
served
up
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
yet
this
isnt
the
equal
of
three
floyds
brilliant
brian
boru
not
close
nor
is
it
close
to
boulevards
bully
porter
a
good
steady
beer
certainly
and
not
one
to
turn
down
just
not
in
the
upper
strata
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
big
opaque
head
smell
isnt
very
strong
some
malty
characters
and
some
biscuit
aromas
taste
is
pretty
good
though
has
a
lot
of
interesting
malt
flavors
one
of
the
better
irish
ales
most
of
them
seem
kinda
bland
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
and
only
a
few
days
till
st
pattys
day
im
really
enjoying
this
style
its
like
a
sweeter
pale
ale
and
much
more
smooth
with
the
malt
presence
i
easily
enjoyed
a
couple
of
these
one
evening
i
could
also
easily
persuade
myself
to
buy
another
sixpack
i
keep
coming
back
for
a
whiff
its
really
pleasing
pours
out
a
rusty
orangered
with
middling
carbonation
and
a
pretty
thick
head
atop
leaves
some
thick
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
a
good
deal
of
toasty
crystal
lots
of
fruity
esters
going
on
that
i
tend
to
associate
with
boulevard
theres
kind
of
a
tinge
of
piny
hops
taste
is
sufficiently
malty
with
a
good
bit
of
toastiness
theres
the
fruitiness
here
which
reminds
me
of
fruity
bubblegums
theres
a
bit
of
that
beyondtoasted
malt
character
that
i
get
from
fat
tire
and
much
of
the
new
belgium
line
here
which
almost
gives
off
the
effect
of
cocoa
powder
slight
medicinal
flavors
bit
of
pine
hop
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
light
in
weight
and
extremely
creamy
drinkability
is
ok
i
really
didnt
like
this
beer
right
off
but
as
i
work
my
way
through
the
6
pack
over
the
course
of
a
couple
weeks
i
find
myself
liking
it
more
with
such
a
low
abv
you
could
drink
this
all
day
but
i
would
probably
choose
something
else
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
handed
to
me
though
decent
brew
nothing
extraordinary
d
this
is
a
tasty
irish
red
and
perhaps
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
tried
from
boulevard
id
certainly
pick
this
up
again
during
the
season
o
the
irish
poured
into
tumbler
dark
amber
with
a
1
head
that
quickly
breaks
into
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lacing
smells
of
toffee
and
maybe
candy
corn
not
a
lot
of
hops
malty
and
smooth
all
the
way
through
caramel
wood
sweet
with
very
slight
bitterness
at
the
finish
not
the
best
red
ale
ive
had
but
pretty
good
had
on
tap
in
a
boulevard
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
coppery
orange
with
a
slight
tan
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
that
leaves
just
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
isnt
out
of
this
world
pretty
basic
with
a
big
caramel
sweetness
finishing
with
citrus
hops
that
gives
it
the
sensation
of
smelling
orange
rinds
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
malty
presence
the
melds
into
the
hops
its
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
have
you
believe
my
biggest
problem
is
that
there
is
a
slight
metallic
taste
to
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
i
think
i
think
that
they
could
have
done
a
bit
more
with
the
beer
d
this
beer
is
good
but
flawed
good
for
someone
who
likes
dry
hoppy
alesas
i
dobut
lack
of
malt
body
and
watery
palate
preclude
greatness
great
session
beer
though
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
from
boulevard
irish
reds
are
a
style
i
cant
really
get
to
excited
about
but
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
if
you
were
sitting
down
for
a
game
or
in
a
more
social
situation
where
more
than
a
few
would
be
consumed
in
a
night
thanks
vance
d
a
good
brew
from
boulevard
not
one
of
their
best
but
its
pretty
good
irish
ale
is
an
above
average
though
not
spectacular
irish
red
buy
this
six
pack
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
color
the
head
is
medium
sized
and
fades
away
pretty
quickly
smells
bready
and
yeasty
taste
is
malty
buttery
and
slightly
toasty
there
is
also
a
nice
earthy
taste
from
the
hops
the
bitterness
levels
are
nice
as
well
mouthfeel
is
good
with
smooth
carbonation
very
drinkable
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
very
drinkable
i
think
i
could
see
this
being
a
session
choice
with
some
frequency
if
it
were
sold
here
draught
this
one
pours
a
fairly
clear
amber
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
head
on
it
and
it
left
some
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
bit
light
what
was
there
was
pleasant
with
notes
of
roast
and
a
bit
of
caramel
it
does
taste
pretty
good
taste
is
slightly
caramel
malt
sweet
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
hint
of
hops
providing
a
nice
balance
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
nor
my
favorite
boulevard
brew
still
this
is
a
decent
beer
from
a
brewery
which
makes
several
good
brews
an
easy
drinker
but
its
pretty
average
stuff
close
in
vibe
to
your
everyday
average
brown
or
amber
ale
a
very
smooth
yet
tasty
drinker
ive
had
this
many
times
before
and
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
hadnt
reviewed
it
yet
i
think
this
is
a
top
notch
example
of
the
style
and
i
believe
my
favourite
to
date
very
well
done
boulevard
thanks
to
bort11
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
5107
lasered
on
the
neck
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
clear
reddish
color
it
had
a
couple
finger
head
that
settled
into
a
thin
film
during
the
session
good
carb
the
aroma
was
a
little
muted
but
had
good
malt
backbone
and
slight
toasted
smell
the
taste
was
good
not
spectacular
but
nice
easy
drinking
kinda
beer
mouthfeel
was
good
overall
its
a
good
session
type
beer
that
quenches
the
thrist
with
above
average
taste
recommend
if
you
can
easily
get
3
5
rb
t
o
d
good
stuff
nothing
memorable
or
outstanding
but
its
a
fine
lowerabv
session
beer
a
good
session
choice
for
st
pattys
day
if
you
are
bored
with
guinness
killians
and
bud
light
in
green
aluminum
bottles
pours
a
deep
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
quickly
disappearing
white
head
and
small
amounts
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
fruit
taste
has
a
nice
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
this
is
an
easy
drinker
nothing
too
spectacular
just
a
solid
red
im
much
more
impressed
with
the
final
few
ounces
than
i
was
with
the
first
few
whether
the
improvement
was
due
to
warming
or
to
the
goodies
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
couldnt
say
boulevard
irish
ale
still
cant
touch
great
lakes
conways
irish
or
three
floyds
brian
boru
but
its
damn
good
beer
all
the
same
ill
be
sure
to
look
for
it
again
next
march
a
fine
brew
if
theres
one
thing
boulevards
good
at
its
making
palatable
beers
that
even
newbies
can
enjoy
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
a
great
session
beer
and
a
great
crossover
beer
far
from
an
overmalted
watery
brew
its
a
maltdriven
but
balanced
brew
easy
sipping
for
a
german
maibock
fan
or
any
other
maltmouth
the
funky
apple
yeast
flavor
that
emerges
will
please
belgian
fiends
and
lovers
of
localcraft
beer
will
appreciate
the
midwest
tlc
applied
to
this
classic
style
cheers
kc
best
beer
brewed
d
very
drinkable
session
beer
i
actually
enjoyed
it
more
at
a
colder
temperature
as
it
warmed
the
body
seemed
to
thin
out
but
still
a
great
irish
red
boulevard
irish
ale
was
a
clear
redbrown
color
with
good
clarity
and
a
light
tan
head
the
head
was
a
good
inch
thick
and
had
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
sweet
caramel
malt
the
taste
was
malty
upfront
with
some
nice
hop
flavor
towards
the
dry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
in
the
spring
nice
little
pop
of
alcohol
at
5
3abv
a
smooth
drinker
that
warms
the
cockles
on
a
snowy
feb
day
nothing
spectacular
just
good
fresh
local
beer
this
years
batch
seems
a
bit
bolder
than
what
i
remember
of
last
years
good
stuff
i
know
spring
is
coming
soon
when
these
hit
the
shelves

ia
drinkability
good
enough
but
i
dont
think
id
drink
more
than
one
not
really
my
kind
of
thing
this
brew
pours
a
clear
blood
red
color
the
head
is
huge
fluffy
reddish
off
white
in
color
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
faint
but
some
fruity
sweetness
and
caramel
can
be
detected
with
a
lot
of
work
the
taste
is
sweet
with
enough
fruity
esters
to
add
some
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
irish
red
ale
that
i
can
see
myself
buying
again
better
than
killians
but
there
are
much
better
brews
out
there
of
course
i
have
to
say
i
like
over
hopped
beers
so
one
whould
take
that
into
account
when
reading
this
review
the
beer
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
its
a
bit
sweet
with
a
dry
bitter
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
roasted
flavor
that
boasts
of
crystal
malts
and
roasted
barley
it
has
a
mild
hop
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
the
yeast
seems
to
give
it
an
overly
dry
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
think
i
may
have
aquired
an
older
bottle
hence
the
overly
dry
and
carbonated
feel
pours
out
a
reddish
copper
color
maybe
a
two
finger
head
it
leaves
some
lace
as
you
drink
it
the
beer
is
very
typical
of
an
irish
ale
hoppy
and
slightly
bitter
it
goes
down
very
smooth
goes
great
on
st
patricks
day
if
you
dont
have
any
guinness
or
harp
on
hand
dvery
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
discovered
this
a
long
time
ago
a
very
solid
red
ale
that
could
be
a
nice
session
brew
pours
out
of
the
12
ounce
stubby
bottle
a
less
than
clear
dark
auburn
colour
with
an
off
white
frothy
head
sticky
lace
makes
it
a
looker
citric
aroma
some
subdued
fruity
maltiness
too
toasty
maltiness
backed
by
a
touch
of
fruit
and
floral
hoppiness
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
session
ale
body
is
quite
light
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
prickly
but
otherwise
soft
and
smooth
this
is
a
nice
unoffending
red
ale
refreshing
tasty
and
just
perfect
for
spending
st
patricks
day
at
home
drinkability
very
easy
to
pack
these
away
low
alcohol
content
makes
this
an
excellent
sessioner
on
that
i
am
likely
to
have
again
on
st
pattys
day
gotta
say
this
is
one
brew
that
wasnt
as
good
ontap
for
me
seemed
a
bit
too
thin
and
lacked
the
complexity
of
flavor
that
the
bottled
version
had
still
a
pretty
good
seasonal
from
boulevard
thats
worth
trying
appearance
has
a
smooth
creamy
tan
caramel
tan
head
body
is
amber
red
leaves
even
thick
chunks
of
lacing
aroma
contains
caramel
malt
sweetness
with
pine
cone
scented
hops
definitely
hoppier
than
the
average
irish
red
which
is
a
plus
in
my
book
taste
has
upfront
malted
wheaties
sweetness
touch
of
caramel
creamy
tone
altogether
with
a
mild
bitterness
but
complex
piney
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
mildly
carbonated
very
smooth
with
each
sip
drinkability
is
very
nice
all
around
definitely
better
than
many
other
beers
of
this
style
go
irish
this
march
with
boulevards
take
on
the
style
id
hoped
for
better
too
strong
a
hop
presence
for
my
liking
in
this
style
very
nicely
balanced
nothing
overdone
very
smooth
and
extremely
easy
to
drink

of
the
best

thanks

and
jimdkc
pours
a
sexy
brown
amber
with
a
tan
headskie
something
striking
about
this
brew
mouthfeel
is
almost
perfect
wow
what
drinkability
but
i
havnt
even
gotten
to
the
flavor
yet
tastes
good
haha
yeah
thats
the
simple
truth
nice
full
flavor
is
simple
yet
subtile
and
it
works
a
nice
ale
this
one
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
medium
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
has
a
buttery
thing
going
on
the
flavor
has
a
strong
caramel
backbone
with
a
much
stronger
hop
presence
than
the
aroma
would
tell
fairly
large
in
body
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
wonderful
but
a
very
nice
offering
for
the
style
purchased
from
johns
grocery
in
feb
2005
and
consumed
that
same
evening
reviewed
from
notes
pours
a
12
finger
tan
head
over
a
red
brown
liquid
smells
chocoaltey
sweet
and
lightly
of
coffee
tastes
lihglty
chocolate
with
some
coffee
too
flavors
are
quite
mild
and
some
stornger
malt
sweet
would
have
added
a
playful
dimension
medium
mouthfeel
which
is
a
surprise
as
ive
found
boulevard
products
to
usually
lack
in
this
characteristic
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
pours
a
nice
rubied
amber
color
with
a
nice
coat
of
head
over
top
the
nose
is
caramel
and
slight
diacetyl
with
a
spicey
hop
interesting
the
flavor
is
a
little
better
than
the
nose
the
hop
is
more
dominant
with
not
a
very
prevalent
buttery
character
the
caramel
malt
comes
in
on
the
end
i
like
it
the
feel
is
nice
and
thick
with
a
moderate
carb
im
impressed
with
this
beer
one
of
the
better
irish
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
the
taste
has
a
certain
fullness
and
balance
just
a
hint
of
tartness
at
the
finish
certainly
drinkable
and
well
above
the
reds
and
limp
irish
beers
i
tend
to
see
available
just
not
as
much
of
a
stand
out
as
the
other
blvd
beers
bravo
boulevard
bravo
the
taste
was
quite
redeeming
of
the
smell
though
it
seems
somewhat
subdued
initially
the
taste
is
of
roasted
barley
and
wheat
malts
caramel
and
the
perfect
balance
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
also
this
is
the
first
beer
i
can
remember
drinking
recently
with
an
abv
under
5
thus
i
could
drink
these
all
night
this
beer
is
an
awesome
balance
between
huge
taste
and
low
alcohol
i
will
probably
buy
more
before
the
seasonal
stock
runs
out
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
and
had
a
tan
head
that
did
not
stick
around
it
has
a
very
sweet
malty
aroma
and
a
touch
of
hops
in
there
too
the
flavor
is
really
balanced
and
refreshing
quite
complex
actually
way
above
my
tasting
skills
but
from
a
pure
enjoyment
standpoint
it
is
just
plain
good
worthy
of
any
true
beer
lovers
refrigerator
pours
a
dark
red
hue
wwith
a
big
creamy
offwhite

very
beautiful
color
smells
of
roasted
malt
and
sweet
carmel
scents
with
some
floral
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
very
sweet
at
first
then
tart
then
those
flavors
fade
to
reveal
a
roasted
malt
backbone
that
really
works
well
with
its
final
transition
into
adequate
hops
presence
very
good
well
rounded
with

flavor
that
i
could
sip
all
night
deep
copper
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
fluffs
itself
up
and
lasts
for
quite
some
time
theres
even
some
patchwork
quilt
lacing
on
the
glass
impressive
aromas
are
toasted
grains
and
dark
druit
theres
even
some
spicy
character
to
it
flavor
is
balanced
sweet
malty
flavors
mix
nicely
with
the
hops
aided
by
a
dash
of
doughy

good
session

more
kudos
to
the
huge
one
a
very
tasty
irish
red
ale
with
an
intriguing
almost
belgian
flair
this
is
my
first
boulevard
beer
and
the
folks
in
kansas
city
have
a
good
thing
going
unique
and
interesting
i
could
drink
these
all
day
body
is
lighter
side
of
medium
this
is
nothing
to
jump
up
and
down
about
but
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
low
abv
easy
drinking
sessionstyle
beer
i
rate
drinkability
as
a
3
0
because
while
it
is
easy
drinking
its
not
one
i
would
be
dying
to
drink
again
that
is
what
i
consider
drinkability
i
took
some
of
this
to
a
family
gathering
and
even
the
macro
drinkers
liked
it
overall
a
good
balanced
amber
ale

warm
this
is

fact
that
in

it
is
a
1

kinda
boring

adequate

good
beer

dark

color
with
an
off

head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
leaving
a

of

first
sip
was
great
really
refreshing
it
has
a
nice
malty
sweet
taste
to
it
with
a
nice
lingering
sensation
in
the
mouth
had
it
out
of
a
keg
not
sure
how
similar
the
bottle
is
but
after
drinking
this
i
decided
i
had
to
go
out
and
get
some
more
great
seasonal
brew
a
very
drinkable
beer
from
boulevard
it
is
mellow
without
being
bland
boulevards

irish
ale
pours
a
beautiful
deep

color
with
an
amazing
nitrolike
head
of
tan
tinybubbled
foam
creating
a
sheeting
blanket
of
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
head
lasts
forever
the
nose
is
very
understated
but
a
vigorous
swirl
reveals
a
slight
roasted
malt
character
the
supersmooth
velvety
body
feels
like
nitro
but
without
the
helium
aftertaste
the
taste
is
pretty
nicemalty
without
being
roasty
or
thick
and
still
quite
fresh
tasting
like
recently
cracked
malt
with
the
obligatory
low
hopping
rate
this
beer
tends
toward
a
bit
of
sourness
in
the
finish
but
not
too
much
also
this
beer
is
sweetish
but
not
overly
so
the
hops
make
a
very
brief
herbal
appearance
in
the
middle
of
the
flavor
and
then
recede
again
forced
into
their
minor
role
by
the
complex
maltiness
i
keep
coming
back
to
the
smoothness
of
the
body
though
its
really
extraordinary
if
this
isnt
the
perfect
macro
to
micro
transition
beer
i
dont
know
what
is
sweetish
but
not
syrupy
barely
hoppy
but
not
at
all
bitter
and
easier
and
smoother
to
drink
than
proper
guinness
i
really
wish
i
had

it

an

session
beer
decided
to
try
something
new
picked
up
a
six
pack
at
a
local
liquor
store
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
for
a
pale
ale
my
friends
asked
me
what
it
taste
like
and
the
best
thing
i
can
describe
it
as
is
a
mixture
of
killians
red
and
any
normal
ipa
i
will
buy
this
again
overall
relatively
tasty
and
drinkable
i
could
probably
quaff
quite
a
few
of
these
although
the
diacetyl
does
bother
me
a
little
bit
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
like
an
average
irish
red
ale
the
only
real
drawback
was
that
the
smell
was
very
weak
and
seems
like
it
could
use
stronger
aromas
o
the
bar
that
served
this
had
no
craft
to
offer
so
i
gave
this
a
shot
is
it
the
same
beer
that
ive
had
at
mcsorleys
in
nyc
many
times
i
dont
know
on
its
own
not
bad
id
try
more
this
beer
would
make
a
yuengling
drinker
never
look
back
overall
a
decently
tasty
and
quite
easy
to
drink
brew
while
not
the
best
it
is
quite
drinkable
o
not
good
i
hate
it
when
american
breweries
make
a
bad
product
and
call
it
irish
a
slight
hint
of
diacytel
is
appropriate
not
an
overwhelming
character
it
tastes
rushed
like
they
didnt
give
it
adequate
time
to
ferment
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
medium
copper
with
a
tall
creamy
eggshell
colored
head
there
are
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
slowly
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
there
are
some
sweet
malts
and
floral
hops
in
the
aroma
i
did
pick
up
that
medicinal
odor
a
previous
reviewer
spotted
theres
a
mild
sweet
breadiness
to
the
flavor
the
hops
come
through
on
the
back
end
but
its
not
very
strong
its
also
a
bit
nutty
theres
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
sticks
to
the
mouth
but
fades
quickly
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the
crowd
but
its
worth
a
try
if
you
feel
like
picking
up
a
single
overall
a
decent
brew
but
for
a
pale
ale
it
was
just
a
little
light
in
the
hops
department
in
fact
it
was
more
like
an
english
ale
than
anything
else
pours
a
clear
amber
nice
cap
off
faintly
offwhite
froth
scent
brings
a
balance
of
light
caramel
toasted
grain
grassy
and
floral
hops
moderately
flavorful

profile
floral
then
grassy
sweet
malt
backbone
with
light
caramel
and
light

and
bready
qualities
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
fizzy
and
watery
somewhat
of
a
decent
surprise
didnt
expect
any
character
but
had
some
nice
notes
that
make
it
drinkable
and
preferred
over
the
bmc
crap
at
this
particular
bar
enjoyed
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
think
this
beer
gets
an
undue
average
rating
while
the
taste
is
rather
mild
it
lingers
pleasantly
and
is
enjoyable
to
drink
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
who
is
interested
in
acquiring
an
affinity
for
ipas
as
it
is
not
quite
as
hoppy
yet
still
has
the
essence
of
an
indian
pale
ale
overall
i
respect
the
long
tradition
of
this
beer
but
truth
be
told
they
need
to
tweak
it
its
good
but
not
one
youd
say
damn
good
beer
notes
ok
its
beer
drinkable
anything
else
o
not
bad
but
not
great
just
an
average
irish
red
ale
serving
type
bottle
not
the
greatest
overall
its
a
beer
thats
not
too
complex
in
terms
of
flavor
which
is
fine
but
it
leaves
something
more
to
be
desired
aside
from
that
its
a
decent
beer
with
no
offensive
qualities
and
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
too
and
perfect
for
almost
any
occasion
very
light
orangecolored
red
ale
with
a
very
thin
head
and
a
maltybuttery
aroma
i
quite
enjoyed
drinking
this
onebiscuit
fruit
toasted
malt
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
presence
goes
down
very
nicely
although
its
again
on
the
light
and
watery
side
fun
to
drink
with
chili
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
surprised
to
taste
a
beer
of
this
quality
from
papst
the
other
mcsorleys
wasnt
on
par
with
this
one
o
good
irish
ale
perhaps
a
bit
lighter
than
some
but
good
body
and
flavor
amber
red
coppery
ale
heads
up
decently
but
does
not
last
acidic
aroma
taste
is
almost
a
cross
between
smithwicks
and
killians
but
with
an
acidic
astringent
bite
im
not
sure
what
needs
to
be
changed
about
this
brew
but
something
is
just
plain
off
odd
aftertaste
as
well
still
not
the
worst
thing
ive
drunk
the
alcohol
wasnt
too
high
or
low
here
and
had
it
been
it
would
have
added
to
the
slight
heavyhandedness
of
the
taste
thankfully
the
carbonation
is
just
right
and
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
allowing
for
this
beer
to
go
down
a
bit
easier
this
would
go
great
with
a
corned
beer
sandwich
and
a
viewing
of
the
quiet
man
but
for
a
drinking
session
theres
a
lot
more
out
there
that
pleases
easier
this
is
only
worth
a
try
for
diehard
fans
of
the
style
the
most
remarkable
characteristics
for
this
beer
were
its
color
which
was
rich
full
and
slightly
reddish
and
its
great
balance
it
immediately
struck
me
as
being
very
appetizing
in
its
appearance
which
featured
a
thick
head
along
with
the
nice
color
the
aroma
was
not
particularly
remarkable
but
that
was
ok
because
the
flavor
was
full
like
the
hue
it
was
slightly
heavier
than
i
expected
in
a
pale
ale
which
kept
the
bitter
on
the
back
allowing
the
malty
side
some
attention
it
was
overall
very
appetizing
to
the
eye
and
to
the
taste
id
buy
more
poured
out
as
a
red
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
slight
sweet
malt
backbone
with
just
a
touch
of
hop
aroma
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
typical
it
had
some
malts
and
some
hops
in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
overall
its
not
the
best
irish
red
ive
had
but
it
wasnt
terrible
o
not
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
pale
ale
or
an
irish
red
the
bottle
says
it
is
now
made
in
utica
ny
overall
a
pretty
good
irish
ale
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
has
some
good
flavor
i
would
like
to
try
this
at
the
pub
in
nyc
someday
mo
very
crisp
drinkable
session
ale
that
really
has
a
good
flavor
and
balance
that
make
a
good
tavern
ale
this
pours
a
clear
copper
color
with
no
head
its
aroma
is
fruity
with
bread
and
maybe
some
honey
mixed
in
the
flavor
has
notes
of
citrus
molasses
and
pine
followed
by
a
curious
taste
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
light
paving
the
way
for
a
good
drinkability
lion
mcsorleys
irish
red
ale
is
a
decent
beer
slightly
recommended
d
expected
the
beer
to
be
more
gimmick
than
substance
pleasantly
surprised
a
fairly
decent
beer
in
what
is
usually
an
average
category
it
really
hit
the
spot
i
dont
know
if
it
was
because
it
was
served
so
cold
but
it
sure
did
taste
good
and
went
down
easy
overall
this
beer
is
alright
and
a
bit
different
from
the
one
i
got
in
ny
city
at
the
famous
bar
on
the
label
very
drinkable
but
not
worth
going
up
to
maine
and
getting
another
sixer
i
think
i
will
stick
to
the
delicious
maine
beers
next
time
i
am
up
there
irish
pale
ale
id
never
heard
of
it
so
i
figured
id
try
it
i
can
live
without
it
this
is
a
very
average
beer
not
very
complex
like
ipas
the
color
is
nice
a
reddish
brownish
hue
but
the
taste
is
a
little
watery
im
not
sorry
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
trying
it
again
o
not
bad
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
point
to
buy
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
either
this
is
okay
performing
pretty
well
tastewise
and
thats
where
it
counts
most
easy
to
drink
despite

mcsorleys
irish
pale
ale
is
a
lively
deep
golden
ale
with
a
thick
off
white
foam
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
cavelike
aroma
with
a
cardboard
note
and
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
the
smooth
soft
medium
body
has
a
slightly
chalky
finish
theres
a
little
green
bitterness
followed
by
some
sweet
caramel
the
finish
is
bitter
sweet
and
herbal
it
tastes
substantive
but
theres
no
need
to
sip
it
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
amber
color
with
little
off
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
as
you
drink
the
aroma
is
apparent
with
sweet
malty
notes
and
some
fruity
notes
the
taste
starts
malty
sweet
and
pretty
much
ends
there
overall
an
average
pale
ale
overall
the
appearance
and
nose
really
had
me
going
but
i
was
let
down
by
the
flavor
still
this
is
a
decent
beer
and
will
not
deter
me
for
visiting
mcsorleys
one
day
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
effort
maybe
ba
bad
but
i
rate
it
as
i
like
it
and
as
such
its
above
average
for
me
and
not
one
to
run
away
from
i
can
drink
a
few
easy
going
down
taste
is
good
feels
good
definitely
a
beer
to
choose
if
all
the
other
beers
are
lame
if
someone
handed
me
a
six
pack
i
would
drink
them
but
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
beer
in
the
future

quite
full
with
a
good
use

drinks
ok
and
wasnt
bad
really
but
i
dont
think
im
going
to
revisit
this
anytime
soon
though
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
needs
work
it
looked
great
with
its
reddishcopper
body
with
a
thick

to
top
the
smell
is
a
bit
caramely
with
a

to
it
the
taste
is
all
the
with
a
bit
of
bittering
hops
and
a
slight
butterscotch
note
on
it
its
odd
that
theres
almost
no
aftertaste
on
this
beer
its
got
a
thick
body
and
is
a
bit
filling
d
the
flavors
are
right
the
abv
is
right
the
syrupiness
is
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
beer
it
leaves
a
candycoated
feeling
on
the
tongue
other
than
that
way
way
way
drinkable
overall
its
alright
not
a
beer
i
am
going
to
be
purchasing
anytime
soon

in
a
glass
mug
many
atime
at
mcsorleys
tavern
in
nyc
i
had
the
12oz
bottle
a
few
times
as
well
mostly
clear
copper
body
with
a
medium
creamy
offwhite
had
sweet
earthy
and
light
malt
aroma
sweet
earthy
flavor
light
malt
and
slight
metallic
hints
medium
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
perfect
for
binge
drinking
a
reasonable
but
not
exciting
beer
ok
drinkability
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
agian
mcsorleys
irish
pale
ale
has
a
pale
copper
colored
hue
and
a
very
light
citrusy
aroma
the
mild
appearance
and
smell
characteristics
were
quite
indicative
of
the
overall
texture
and
flavor
the
light
body
of
this
ale
makes
it
very
drinkable
but
the
lack
of
flavor
or
complexity
leaves
its
overall
character
quite
mediocre
there
is
a
soft
distinguished
malt
flavor
but
it
is
subtle
almost
to
a
fault
a
decent
pale
ale
but
not
much
to
write
home
about
i
believe
this
is
the
light
at
mcsoreleys
ale
house
in
new
york
city
pours
a
pale
orange
colour
with
half
of
the
glass
being
head
head
dissipates
to
a
ring
along
the
top
of
the
beer
quick
enough
but
still
lasts
until
your
finish
your
half
glass
they
give
you
2
glasses
lacing
over
some
of
the
glass
smells
of
grainy
malt
almost
no
hops
whatsoever
very
light
sweetness
no
bitterness
in
the
flavour
medium
bodied
ale
easy
to
drink
but
not
all
that
interesting
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
thin
creamy
tan
head
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
of
oatmeal
and
a
hint
of
vinegar
taste
is
bready
up
front
with
a
yeasty
middle
followed
by
some
ripe
fruit
flavor
and
a
spicy
earthy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
ultimately
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
one
at
a
time
is
plenty
still
i
would
get
this
again
i
am
somewhat
surprised
at
how
low
its
overall
score
is
drinkability
this
beer
has
potential
but
lacks
depth
in
almost
every
area
its
passable
but
not
really
worth
buying
regularly
not
terrible
but
hugely
disappointing
d
not
all
that
impressive
an
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
a
very
easy
drink
there
are
no
flaws
and
it
exhibits
all
of
the
irish
ale
characteristics
pours
a
good
looking
orange
medium
quickly
dissipating
head
and
little
to
zero
lace
smells
of
cheap
beer
and
alcohol
some
brown
sugar
mixed
in
taste
is
sharp
again
with
the
alcohol
and
some
present
but
confused
hops
in
other
words
its
bitter
but
not
good
mouthfeel
is
average
but
the
drinkability
suffers
from
the
belowaverage
taste
if
it
were
good
wed
call
it
complicated
could
have
a
couple

a

were
really
quite
enjoyable
it
started
malty
and
then
went
into
a
soft
hoppiness
comprised
of
two
layers
not
very
stark
tastes
or
body
one
that
got
away
tear
with
this
review
i
will
say
it
like
a
man
and
make
you
understand
what
this
brews
all
about
it
pours
an

the
body
a
light

the

is
nowhere

of

somehow

i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
it
is
not
the
best
beer
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
not
really
too
impressed
with
this
one
it
seems
to
have
a
strange
metallic
aftertaste
very
different
i
really
cannot
tell
what
would
go
good
with
this
beer
it
almost
has
a
sense
of
sucking
on
a
9
volt
battery
after
taking
a
swig
of
beer
maybe
a
baked
potato
would
go
good
with
this
beer
or
a
really
starchy
food
not
really
impressive
drinkability
no
reason
to
ever
go
here
again
doesnt
really
offer
anything
to
get
excited
about
or
remember
i
could
see
where
drinking
it
on
tap
in
the
original
nyc
bar
could
be
an
experience
but
no
need
to
try
this
out
of
the
bottle
appearence
is
a
golden
brown
with
no
head
and
very
slight
lacing
the
nose
is
that
of
grains
and
light
hop
scents
with
a
malty
essence
the
taste
is
about
what
you
would
expect
a
malty
pale
ale
with
some
breadiness
and
slight
earthy
hoppiness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
as
this
is
easy
to
down
overall
not
bad
good
enough
to
give
a
shot
for
something
different
d
decent
downer
with
a
decent
balance
of
dry
toasted
bread
and
pale
grains
with
soft
hop
accents
good
for
a
few
but
not
an
all
nighter
d
a
runofthemill
english
ale
with
too
much
butteriness
and
astringency
to
be
a
good
call
notes
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
like
to
try
on
tap
drinkability
is
pretty
good
crisp
and
goes
down
easy
probably
not
a
bad

if
your

keep
looking
if
you
looking
for
something
familiar
but
different
this
could
work
ale
is
well
d
not
great
but
not
a
bad
brew
and
i
certainly
enjoyed
the
chance
to
try
it
certainly
the
history
of
the
ale
house
helps
make
this
helps
the
charm
of
this
brew
my
wife
picked
this
up
for
me
thinking
she
found
some
crazy
hard
to
find
beer
i
love
my
wife
a
nice
pour
started
out
this
beera
deep
bronze
color
with
a
creamylike
12
finger
white
head
that
sticks
like
glue
to
the
glass
very
faint
aromas
just
light
butter
and
that
crystal
maltflavors
are
light
but
not
badits
a
malt
driven
ale
and
it
is
what
it
is
buttery
with
sweet
biscuit
flavors
with
atinge
of
toasted
maltthere
is
a
decent
fruitiness
as
well
t
o
me
this
more
like
an
english
pale
than
an
ambermaybe
somewhere
in
between
not
all
that
bad
but
not
anything
to
go
seek
out
the
beer
has
the
ringwood
yeastiness
it
has
some
unmistakable
dry
crystal
malts
it
is
lightly
carbonated
there
is
a
bit
of
diacetyl
in
the
taste
as
well
it
is
just
a
tad
prickly
in
the
mouthfeel
and
it
does
have
a
slightly
chicory
hint
or
two
the
beer
is
a
bit
smooth
not
all
that
creamy
it
has
a
touch
just
a
touch
of
leafy
hop
to
balance
out
those
crystal
malts
but
not
by
much
this
is
a
very
traditional
british
style
irish
ale
with
a
slightly
sourish
finish
it
is
quite
good
refreshing
light
and
hits
all
the
right
notes
overall
this
beer
is
really
nothing
special
but
considering
the
price
and
that
i
got
it
at
wal
mart
its
one
of
your
best
options
out
of
their
selection
saw
this
for
under
6
bucks
for
a
6
pack
and
had
to
try
it
this
one
is
worth
the
try
and
i
would
prolly
buy
it
again
when
selection
is
limited
or
money
is
tight
d
not
too
bad
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
looking
for
this
brew
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
before
this
one
clear

a
thick
creamy

nose
is
quite
buttery
with
some
nuts
and
floral
notes
fruit

is

some

and
a
metallic
edge
hops
are
moderate
quite
dry

body
and
moderate

not
particularly
clean
flavour
but
still
drinkable
pretty
good
but
unspectacular
d
fairly
drinkable
called
irish
pale
ale
categorized
as
an
irish
red
ale
well
this
comes
across
as
a
pale
ale
but
with
a
more
hearty
flavor
and
feel
pretty
solid
atmosphere
nice
appearance
and
a
really
distinctive
nose
although
flavor
is
very
distinctive
the
components
are
subdued
making
for
a
nice
balance
really
solid
quaff
as
far
as
drinkabilty
goes
i
think
this
beer
is
real
drinkable
even
in
large
amounts
cause
it
goes
down
smooth
and
its
not
filling
i
would
defintly
buy
this
agian

im

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
d
im
a
fan
of
irish
reds
but
this
was
just
simply
a
bad
beer
i
wondered
if
i
got
a
old
bottle
but
it
was
well
within
the
freshness
date
i
have
no
desire
to
try
another
to
see
if
this
was
a
fluke
go
for
a
sam
adams
irish
red
for
a
much
more
solid
beer
at
a
similar
price
point
tried
this
one
after
drinking
the
black
lager
liked
this
one
better
and
i
usually
prefer
the
darker
beer
so
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
nice
reddishamber
color
with
a
soft
foam
on
top
fairly
rich
malt
in
the
nose
a
touch
sweet
in
a
good
way
with
a
nicely
balanced
very
mild
hops
bitterness
roasted
caramel
taste
continues
and
the
balance
is
maintained
right
down
to
the
end
little
true
hops
flavor
per
se
but
it
is
really
unique
in
that
way
definitely
worth
trying
something
id
seek
out
and
buy
very
enjoyable
thanks
n
for
bringing
it
by
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amberred
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
fruity
yeast
aroma
it
almost
smells
like
english
ringwood
yeast
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
witha
slight
sweetness
in
the
finish
its
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
aftertaste
this
is
a
quaffable
brew
but
nothing
exceptional
i
had
a
terrible
time
tinding
this
beer
on
ba
also
to
be
noted
that
the
beer
on
ba
is
listed
as
coming
from
lion
brewery
but
on
my
bottle
it
says
mcsorelys
brewery
anyway
i
poured
this
brew
into
my
glass
at
50
degrees
the
beer
amber
colored
with
a
fast
decaying
head
it
had
a
bitter
smell
the
taste
was
interesting
in
that
it
tasted
a
bit
like
it
had
cane
sugar
in
it
i
liked
it
and
will
buy
again
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
big
tan
head
the
smell
is
lightly
toasted
malts
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
it
starts
off
with
some
sweet
malts
that
give
way
to
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
a
tasty
beer
but
completely
onedimensional
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
some
crisp
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
they
made
a
killing
selling
it
on
saint
pattys
day
drinkability
is
good
on
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
tastes
which
makes
it
go
down
very
easy
there
is
not
a
lot
of
really
strong
tastes
that
make
this
beer
anything
better
than
a
killians
or
other
generic
irish
red
mouthfeel
was
a
little
on
the
slick
side
carbonation
level
was
low
detected
some
biscuity
flavors
and
hints
of
sweetness
they
were
there
but
they
faded
quickly
easy
enough
drinker
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
drink
more
than
1
or
2
overall
this
beer
is
just
another
stop
in
my
quest
for
a
nice
irish
red
its
not
terrible
but
there
are
many
others
id
prefer
before
this
d
very
sessionable
beer
perfect
for
a
st
patricks
day
session
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
overall
slightly
faint
and
weak
but
worth
a
try
if
i
were
at
mcsorleys
id
drink
a
few
of
these
drinkability
great
drinkability
good
session
beer
d
goes
down
easy
and
isnt
too
filling
avoid
this
beer
there
are
so
many
things
wrong
with
it
fermented
too
warmly
grain
is
husky
oxidation
great
example
of
many
flaws
all
in
the
same
glass
bleh
not
a
good
beer
at
all
my
usual
beer
store
rarely
got
new
beers
but
received
some
six
packs
of
these
new
mcsorleys
and
cant
say
its
such
a
good
thing
i
mean
it
isnt
offensive
by
any
means
but
isnt
good
at
all
either
i
had
a
mixed
sixer
in
the
fridge
and
asked
my
girlfriend
to
grab
me
a
random
one
and
i
tried
to
guess
what
it
was
i
was
able
to
fathom
some
sort
of
pale
ale
i
guess
from
the
faint
hoppiness
to
it
but
that
was
about
it
id
drink
it
if
given
for
free
but
would
never
purchase
this
on
my
own
notes
for
all
you
homebrewers
out
there
this
is
the
cheapest
six
pack
i
can
find
with
pry
off
bottles
overall
not
the
greatest
ale
i
ever
had
in
fact
not
even
the
best
ale
ive
had
tonight
had
a
sam
adams
boston
ale
earlierbut
ill
buy
it
again
nice
creamy
irish
taste
would
purchase
more
of
this
one
probably
the
worst
craft
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
just
feels
empty
and
has
a
terrible
finish
i
have
3
left

i
am

dreading

tones
a
little

but
still

watery
caramel
notes
with
a
fucked
up
overall
nose
like
husks
of
grains
flavor
makes
me
cringe
i
cant
believe
how
bad
this
beer
is
i
though
it
would
be
promising
instead
i
pour
straight
shit
into
my
glass
induces
gag
reflux
with
a
stale
grainy
finish
this
is
horrible
i
hate
this
beer
with
disdain
please
lets
get
them
closed
down
its
an
abomination
of
a
beer
overall
if
you
like
this
beer
let
me
hand
you
a
personal
fuck
you
d
lackluster
version
of
a
style
that
im
not
partial
to
theres
much
better
out
there
however
the
lightness
of
body
and
weak
flavor
could
up
its
drinkability
overall
its
like
a
light
version
of
a
good
irish
amber
its
got
the
right
flavors
just
not
enough
of
them
and
they
arent
bold
enough
too
light
for
my
liking
so
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
very
good
one
i
never
say
no
to
a
free
bottle
of
a
beer
ive
never
had
before
this
one
pours
a
clear
copperamber
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
decidedly
buttery
with
side
notes
of
light
grass
and
caramel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
decent
amount
of
sweetgrass
on
top
this
helps
to
cut
the
buttery
malts
but
not
enough
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
marginally
dry
finish
overall
an
average
irish
red
at
best
a
beer
that
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
at
all
drinkability
is
good
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
a
lot
of
tastes
going
on
that
would
make
you
want
to
drink
more
it
has
nice
marketing
on
the
bottle
for
st
pattys
day
chugging
beer
so
i
guess
this
beer
fits
someone
who
wants
to
chug
a
fake
irish
beer
all
day
better
than
killians
but
that
means
nothing
thanks
to
rob
at
mgm
for
the
sample
poured
a
medium
reddish
with
a
small
head
that
disappeared
fairly
quick
with
little
lace
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
a
trace
of
malt
at
best
taste
picks
up
a
bit
with
medium
roasted
caramel
malt
lending
a
semisweet
flavor
reminiscent
of
a
tootsie
roll
candy
its
quite
brightly
carbonated
and
in
a
medium
style
body
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
irish
red
ale
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
everything
about
this
beer
was
pretty
spot
on
for
it
style
and
it
was
highly
drinkable
this
would
make
a
good
spring
time
brew
wish
i
had
some
of
these
on
st
pattys
day
another
good
beer
from
grays
and
one
that
i
would
buy
again
and
recommend
to
anybody
who
likes
this
style
this
is
not
something
ill
recommend
to
friends
not
because
it
poorly
represents
the
style
but
because
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
as
far
as
drinkability
within
the
style
i
say
average
or
a
bit
better
drinkability
is
good
nothing
spectacular
about
this
one
but
a
satisfying
beer
overall
mahogany
body
thin
dirty
white
head
lacing
is
sporadic
fresh
yeast
and
caramel
malts
on
the
nose
some
sugar
too
nice
caramel
malt
base
solid
footing
some
dry
woodiness
lingers
which
adds
a
nice
touch
hops
add
a
little
herbalness
all
in
all
a
nice
flavor
profile
body
is
medium
full
subdued
carbonation
though
not
a
creamy
feel
perse
decent
enough
offering
theres
good
crispness
and
smoothness
in
a
light
body
that
might
barely
reach
medium
it
ends
up
a
touch
thin
just
into
the
end
but
keeps
up
well
into
the
finish
o
really
well
done
picked
this
one
up
in
frankenmuth
mi
drank
in
new
hamburg
on
aug
24th
2014
well
done
and
to
style
went
to
the
brewery
in
frankenmuth
which
is
quite
cool
the
beer
is
fresh
to
style
and
worthy
of
drinking
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
had
this
beer
and
i
was
equally
disappointed
thankfully
i
was
not
the
one
that
brought
this
to
the
bottle
share
the
beer
poured
a
dark
red
color
with
a
very
slight
aroma
that
could
best
be
described
as
metallic
the
taste
is
also
faint
though
there
are
some
sweet
malts
present
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
taste
does
not
create
a
strong
impression
in
the
aftertaste
on
senses
the
malts
becoming
somewhat
sour
but
nondescript
in
my
personal
notes
i
wrote
the
word
boring
from
the
first
time
i
sampled
this
beer
i
would
say
that
adjective
still
applies
beer
pours
rust
to
copper
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
hints
at
some
sweet
malt
flavors
perhaps
honey
or
molasses
unfortunately
none
of
these
flavors
make
an
appearance
the
initial
taste
is
metallic
gradually
fading
to
a
faint
but
unpleasant
bitterness
that
lingers
mouthfeel
is
standard
for
an
ale
red
sky
starts
promising
but
ultimately
comes
up
short
overall
its
just
not
that
great
of
a
beer
bad
by
no
means
but
the
beer
would
be
much
better
if
it
had
more
of
an
aroma
to
it
and
didnt
have
that
odd
unnatural
tasting
aftertaste
drinkability
is
okay
on
this
thing
it
is
easy
drinking
but
not
much
to
the
taste
so
not
sure
you
would
want
to
drink
much
of
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
bold
clear
copper
with
no
head
or
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
caramel
with
some
hints
of
wood
and
grass
the
flavor
leads
off
with
caramel
and
nuts
followed
by
bread
crust
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
its
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
drier
than
most
irish
reds
frankenmuth
red
sky
ale
is
a
decent
beer
recommended
p
s
this
is
better
when
warm
o
a
distinctly
tart
irish
ale
thats
a
welcome
change
of
pace
from
the
average
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
red
color
with
a
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
roasted
malt
aromas
as
well
as
some
sweet
caramel
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
much
like
the
nose
the
toasted
malts
and
the
caramel
come
through
with
a
nice
crisp
hoppy
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
carbonated
nicely
with
a
decent
body
to
it
overall
i
found
this
one
to
be
pretty
good
rusty
red
color
hazed
over
though
the
topping
of
head
is
impressive
hint
of
caramel
in
the
nose
with
some
maraschi
no
cherry
toasted
bread
and
a
bit
of
yeast
super
smooth
medium
bodied
twang
from
the
yeast
fades
quickly
and
a
toasted
malt
sweetness
comes
forth
hops
are
modest
but
aim
for
balance
fruity
and
yeasty
in
the
middle
maltiness
stays
clean
and
runs
from
sweet
to
toasted
to
mildly
biscuity
malty
finish
lands
semisweet
it
is
what
it
isa
malt
bomb
of
sorts
and
a
damn
good
rendition
of
an
irish
red
ale
at
that
overall
i
was
pretty
unimpressed
with
this
brew
and
i
thought
it
was
slightly
below
average
as
a
whole
this
beer
was
very
one
dimensional
it
was
pretty
much
all
malts
it
needed
some
hops
to
balance
out
all
the
malts
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
besides
being
a
little
too
fizzy
it
was
pretty
spot
on
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
it
was
a
one
trick
pony
that
only
offered
a
bland
malt
flavor
and
nothing
else
the
lack
of
flavor
hurts
the
drinkability
a
lot
yes
i
could
drink
another
one
but
with
hardly
any
flavor
to
look
forward
to
why
would
i
want
to
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
there
are
many
other
better
red
ales
easily
available
to
me
that
i
would
much
rather
have
then
this
bland
attempt
at
the
style
ill
take
samuel
adams
irish
red
any
day
over
this
beer
i
also
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
this
is
a
miss
from
the
frankenmuth
brewery
and
so
far
my
least
favorite
beer
i
have
had
from
them
and
the
worst
irish
red
ale
i
have
had
to
date
you
guys
may
want
to
stick
with
the
german
styles
cause
this
isnt
working
interesting
amber
ale
that
is
a
summer
session
ale
in
my
book
especially
if
you
palate
enjoys
teh
more
tart
side
of
the
taste
spectrum
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
its
nothing
special
but
its
a
good
beer
for
the
style
and
perfect
for
sipping
on
while
its
warm
out
o
thin
on
flavor
one
and
done
d
a
very
solid
take
on
the
style
although
it
is
not
very
memorable
drinks
nicely
not
a
bad
brew
on
another
day
i
might
have
given
this
a
better
score
but
as
i
said
not
a
bad
brew
to
me
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
red
a
red
is
the
color
if
you
gave
me
a
pint
with
a
blind
fold
on
i
wouldnt
know
it
wasnt
a
brown
there
is
just
no
hop
that
i
am
used
to
coming
in
a
red
ale
overall
a
decent
nutty
red
nothing
special
but
a
really
sweet
but
expensive
growler
excellent
session
ale
real
nice
malt
profile
toasty
touch
of
sweetness
full
flavor
but
easy
drinking
goes
great
with
lots
of
different
foods
unimpressed
looked
good
smelled
good
then
huge
disappointment
lack
the
real
irish
amber
flavor
better
than
a
bud
but
rather
have
a
killians
shame
about
the
metallic
brewdoglike
hops
drank
from
a
bottle
in
dublin
city
centre
bar
because
they
had
no
ipa
including
the
ohara
ipa
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
better
than
most
of
the
other
red
irish
ales
normally
available
i
enjoyed
it
though
it
would
not
be
my
normal
beer
nice
enough
smell
and
taste
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
no
head
whatsoever
after
pouring
bottle
if
you
like
red
ales
i
would
recommend
this
masculine
dark
but
not
to
heavy
shame
about
the
vegetables
what
this
offering
highlights
is
the
fact
that
irish
reds
are
from
a
different
stable
than
american
ambers
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
be
sure
to
taste
it
in
isolation
before
youve
had
anything
else
that
might
confuse
your
taste
buds
its
cleancut
barley
notes
make
oharas
among
the
most
pure
and
veritable
examples
of
the
style
as
they
come
pleasant
irish
red
ale
not
overly
sweet
tasty
very
well
balanced
and
with
a
relatively
huge
drinkability
now
the
style
makes
more
sense
to
me
after
tasting

that
seems
to
be
a
common
feature
of
the
beers
i
have
tried
from
the
country
albeit
with
a

an
okay
beer

i
am
glad
that
we
could
drink
an
irish
beer
this
week
but
i
wouldnt
order
this
one
again
if
this
was
on
draft
and
i
was
sitting
in
a
pub
in
ireland
maybe
but
only
because
it
is
a
true
irish
beer
and
i
would
be
drinking
this
in
ireland
jeremy
and
petulia
were
recently
in
ireland
i
wonder
if
they
had
any
of
this
while
they
were
there
rjt
pours
a
clear
super

around
the

on

down
smell
is
of
toasted

and
a
slight
alcohol
aroma
there
is
also
a
distinct
soy
sauce
aroma
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
up
taste
is
much
the
same
with
toasted
bread
and
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
go
after
again
i
wish
this
beer
came
on
nitro
then
it
would
be
awesome
o
great
drinkability
very
well
done
beer
recommended
this
is
quite
a
lively
solid
brew
for
4
3
i
could
just
pound
these
back
all
day
great
beer
notes
its
not
too
bad
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
drinkable

me

rounds
it
out
tons
of
culinary
potential
with
this
beer
too
its
just
a
rich
but
drinkable
perfect
example
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
right
on
for
what
it
is
excited
carbonation
and
a
just
medium
body
slightly
filling
after
a
few
lots
of
malt
here
but
not
heavy
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
seeking
a
sudsy
irish
red
o
not
the
most
complex
beer
out
there
but
sure
one
that
stays
totally
true
to
its
style
by
bringing
great
balance
and
drinkabilty
definitely
worth
as
a
regular
beer
if
you
can
find
it
for
a
cheap
price
all
the
flavors
work
well
with
each
other
and
the
abv
is
so
low
that
a
few
could
be
had
easily
a
brew
overall
as
i
said
before
this
was
really
big
surprise
for
me
in
a
good
way
surely
beer
that
you
must
try
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
deep
amber
with
a
tall
creamy
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
slowly
leaving
lots
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
theres
a
pleasant
aroma
of
sweet
malts
it
smells
bready
as
well
the
taste
is
malty
and
slightly
sweet
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
and
there
is
some
breadiness
in
the
taste
its
very
delicious
the
body
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
moderate
its
creamy
and
the
finish
is
clean
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
a
solid
delicious
beer
serving
type
bottle
this
is
a
fine
session
beer
with
little
to
discuss
however
it
would
work
well
as
a
social
beer
with
friends
on
a
crisp
autumn
afternoon
on
tap
at
the
linkery
in
san
diego
overall
its
cheaptasting
swill
even
for
this
benighted
style
easy
to
see
why
the
irish
drink
stout
on
their
home
turf
ok
brew
liked
how
this
stood
up
to
food
nice
balance
of
malt
and
bitterness
glad
i
tried
this
overall
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
had
from
oharas
and
its
another
good
one
well
made
very
drinkable
and
no
punches
i
love
breweries
that
arent
pretentious
and
this
is
one
well
done
i
cant
for
the
life
of
me
remember
ifwhen
ive
had
this
beer
before
anyone
regardless
it
pours
a
clear
russetamber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
buttery
biscuit
a
touch
of
mandarin
orange
syrup
and
a
sprinkling
of
cilantro
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
orangelike
qualities
come
to
the
fore
sorta
creating
a
candied
orange
peel
kind
of
flavor
some
added
toffee
helps
this
effect
along
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
dry
finish
overall
an
alright
red
but
not
one
that
i
would
ever
really
seek
out
again
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
overall
i
hadnt
had
this
one
in
several
years
and
well
i
kind
of
remember
why
i
hadnt
particularly
soso
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
irish
red
ale
tried
this
irish
red
in
a
4
pack
from
total
wine
compared
to
other
irish
reds
ive
had
like
sam
admans
and
saranac
i
found
oharas
to
be
the
best
and
most
expensive
it
had
a
nice
dark
rich
color
when
poured
into
a
glass
with
minimal
head
goes
does
nice
and
even
when
warm
still
tasty
bring
the
price
down
and
ill
be
buying
more
overall
a
drinkable
beer
quite
sessionable
but
also
something
that
is
fairly
onedimensional
and
while
id
drink
this
on
another
occasion
i
dont
necessarily
think
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
more
overall
a
decent
beer
probably
wont
buy
it
again
though
i
like
my
reds
hoppy
and
to
taste
a
little
more
like
a
red
when
i
finished
i
saw
that
i
give
it
5
out
of
5
good
so
i
guess
thats
pretty
good
pours
a
dark
ruby
red
moving
to
amber
has
a
nice
frothy
tan
head
with
some
surprising
lacing
aroma
has
a
caramel
malt
burnt
sugar
thing
going
on
i
get
a
little
bit
of
smoked
malts
as
well
taste
isnt
bad
somewhat
middling
theres
a
big
toffee
note
in
the
beginning
of
the
beer
but
its
chased
away
by
more
smoked
malt
character
in
the
finish
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
theres
no
real
hop
character
to
speak
of
this
beer
calls
itself
an
irish
red
but
with
the
smoked
character
it
feels
more
like
a
60
schilling
or
something
similar
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
isnt
anything
drawing
me
back
either
somewhat
mediocre
its
a
little
thin
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
irish
red
not
bad
at
all
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
great
the
second
time
around
i
thik
my
tastes
had
changed
because
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
red
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
lacing
was
decent
but
not
too
impressive
the
smell
was
of
sweet
malts
they
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
scotch
ale
the
taste
seemed
good
the
first
time
with
a
good
malt
base
and
not
much
deviating
from
that
the
second
time
i
think
the
bottle
may
have
been
bad
because
it
just
didnt
taste
the
same
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
overall
the
beer
is
worth
trying
one
last
time
i
think
before
i
come
to
a
true
verdict
on
the
flavor
issues
ok
not
a
must
have
d
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
certainly
not
bad
by
any
means
and
could
probably
be
enjoyable
at
a
concert
or
something
of
that
nature
classic
rust
red
color
with
a
two
finger
head
nice
thick
foam
sweet
malt
notes
like
a
belgian
ale
but
with
some
caramel
spice
has
a
sweet
rootbeer
flavor
at
first
but
then
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
come
through
with
a
crisp
malty
finish
medium
body
with
a
clean
finish
very
enjoyable
beer
d
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
id
defiantly
buy
it
again
taste
is
dryish
and
wellbalanced
up
front
light
swetsour
fruit
and
nut
some
dark
toast
strong
black
tea
and
pepper
bitterness
dominating
finish
and
lingering
with
spicy
fruit
it
is
a
little
too
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
reducing
drinkability
a
little
dr
priced
fairly
when
not
on
draught
not
a
great
beer
but
worthy
of
the
style
its
certainly
worth
a
try
one
of
the
best
beers
from
this
brewery
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
what
it
is
it
is
the
best
irish
red
that
i
have
tried
to
date
but
that
isnt
that
many
the
first
beer
i
ever
brewed
was
an
irish
red
so
you
would
think
that
i
would
have
more
commercial
experience
either
way
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
character
for
such
a
light
one
so
you
should
take
your
time
with
this
one
medium
effervescence
and
body
relatively
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
a
slight
warming
in
the
throat
a
solid
brew
wonder
what
else
they
have
overall
enjoyable
beer
i
wont
be
day
dreaming
about
it
though
o
i
enjoyed
it
while
it
was
there
would
i
purposefully
buy
it
again
no
poured
into
a
pint
glass
deep
amberred
hue
extremely
dark
in
color
with
a
pinkish
head
the
carbonation
is
mild
it
comes
across
very
dry
with
some
caramel
sweetness
the
body
is
filling
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
will
have
again
d
nice
wasnt
expecting
too
much
here
but
this
is
a
solid
irish
red
i
would
drink
this
again
not
sure
id
buy
much
because
its
a
bit
pricey
nice
redbrown
color
nice
smokey
almost
tobaccolike
aroma
nice
tan
head
with
a
good
amount
of
lacing
pours
a
nice
redbrown
color
smell
is
of
tobacco
dark
roated
malt
some
toffee
notes
a
little
disappointed
in
the
flavor
and
palate
feel
from
the
look
and
smell
i
figured
that
it
would
be
smooth
and
flavorful
like
smithwicks
but
it
is
not
lackluster
flavor
and
a
bit
harsh
on
the
palate
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
color
forming
a
large
creamed
coffee
like
hue
fine
speckled
lacing
forms
evenly
on
the
sides
of
my
chalice
aroma
has
some
mild
fruit
notes
hints
of
grape
and
cherry
with
earthy
rounded
notes
with
a
nice
malt
presence
much
more
palatable
than
the
last
irish
red
i
tried
at
double
the
price
hints
of
peated
malt
fruitiness
lingers
on
throughout
the
maltiness
this
beer
could
become
one
dimensional
unless
you
really
really
like
it
underlying
fruit
blends
nicely
together
minimal
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
even
flowing
carbonation
going
on
no
harsness
on
the
palate
really
smoth
and
expressive
this
was
a
solid
authentic
offering
of
the
style
from
across
the
pond
not
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
still
i
wouldnt
describe
this
as
dry
there
isnt
much
hop
to
this
brew
comes
closest
to
a
scotch
ale
the
body
is
full
with
a
low
carbonation
d
a
good
beer
but
a
strange
red
again
stouter
than
i
expected
it
pairs
excellently
with
slowroasted
pork
belly
not
a
lot
going
on
here
but
would
probably
make
for
a
pleasant
enough
session
definitely
a
better
choice
than
a
macro
d
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
it
had
a
great
appearance
and
the
taste
was
really
good
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
especially
with
the
low
abv
one
of
the
best
red
ales
ive
had
drinkability
aftertaste
is
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
to
enjoy
often
well
carbonated
and
full
of
life
but
somewhat
lacking
in
depth
or
inner
strenght
an
ok
beer
but
not
an
outstanding
one
in
my
eyes
pours
a
deep
amber
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
doesnt
retain
particularly
well
the
aroma
is
very
british
in
style
with
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
dark
fruits
burtonized
water
fruity
esters
and
some
slight
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
similar
with
soft
caramel
and
treacle
notes
upfront
along
with
some
apple
and
cherry
earthy
hops
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
oak
sharp
carbonation
and
a
kiss
of
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
understated
irish
red
ale
probably
more
representative
of
the
style
than
the
hopped
up
american
versions
taste
some
slight
tang
to
the
ale
but
really
not
much
going
on
the
bitterness
prolly
isnt
desireable
in
this
style
of
beer
tastes
as
if
it
is
a
half
red
half
brown
ale
blend
with
the
slight
nuttiness
and
subtlety
read
boring
that
fans
of
session
beers
like
lacking
depth
substance
ingredients
it
seems
notes
this
is
not
your
average
irish
red
a
bit
of
a
malt
bomb
but
i
like
what
theyve
done
with
it
there
are
almost
some
stoutlike
qualities
flavor
and
body
are
more
robust
than
most
examples
of
the
style
but
it
still
retains
its
sessionability
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
watery
bland
reds
that
saturate
the
market
medium
body
chewy
lower
carbonation
smooth
quick
drinking
although
the
flavor
profile
isnt
exactly
anything
spectacular
still
alright
for
the
style
though
d
this
is
an
okay
red
ale
not
fabulous
but
tasty
and
drinkable
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
not
my
particular
taste
and
i
can
honestly
say
i
dont
think
im
going
to
be
buying
this
one
md
light
and
dry
feel
this
is
a
beer
that
goes
down
real
easy
it
is
pretty
pricey
for
just
an
okay
beer
overall
a
below
average
red
ale
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
nice
flavor
the
taste
is
slightly
burnt
and
smoky
caramel
but
in
a
good
way
the
overall
feel
is
very
balanced
and
it
is
one
of
the
best
irish
ales
i
had
the
pleasure
to
drink
very
little
bitter
taste
can
be
felt
which
is
true
to
the
style
however
maybe
there
is
a
slight
lack
of
complexity
in
the
taste
for
this
to
be
a
world
class
brew
interesting
d
ok
but
not
that
great
of
a
beer
wouldnt
seek
out
again
pours
a
dark
rubybrown
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
12
of
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
caramel
and
nuttiness
from
the
aroma
are
slightly
less
present
in
the
flavor
this
wellrounded
ale
has
just
a
slight
hop
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
very
sweet
malty
character
to
it
nice
carbonation
a
good
beer
though
i
certainly
prefer
their
celebration
stout
medium
body
with
an
unfortuante
late
bitterness
and
slight
aftertaste
some
sweetness
up
front
slight
roast
in
the
back
i
wonder
how
they
got
the
black
colour
to
this
beer
u
added
intentionally
eh
its
relatively
easy
drinking
not
too
impressed
in
general
sorry
overall
a
decent
brew
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
easy
drinking
nothing
too
special
here
but
not
bland
d
it
was
relatively
easy
to
drink
this
beer
but
nothing
really
stood
out
about
the
taste
so
im
not
sure
if
i
would
have
it
again
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
its
a
tad
thin
but
not
offbalance
its
drinkable
smooth
and
if
anything
a
bit
too
sweet
but
overall
a
nice
showing
tastes
like
it
smells
only
with
a
wee
bitty
dose
of
dry
european
hops
near
the
back
end
the
whole
thing
is
nitrogen
smooth
which
makes
it
feel
nice
in
your
mouth
but
also
taste
a
little
weird
i
have
a
feeling
that
maybe
this
one
is
a
little
bit
better
fresh
solid
two
fingers
of
light
tan
foam
somewhat
delicate
microbubbles
steady
dissolve
with
much
lacing

amber
color
with
a
little
more
brown

orange
excellent
clarity
and
vividness
bready
nose
with
caramel
chocolate
fudge
sugar
cane
and
a
hint
of
golden
raisin
and
date
alongside
the
pear
apple
scents
the
hops
come
across
as
mixed
drink
bitters
with
a
pinch
of
green
field
grasses
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
has
an
aggressiveness
which
comes
out
of
left
field
churns
things
up
and
favors
the
bitter
grassy
element
as
well
as
sour
grapefruit
lemon
citrus
the
maltiness
more
of
a
powdery
texture
here
hence
less
sweetness

pit
flash

through

beer
throws
a
fair
amount
of
curveballs
tried
it
for
st
pattys
day
not
particularly
interested
nice
and
drinkable
not
horrible
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
begs
you
to
drink
it
by
far
the
best
irish
beer
ive
had
so
far
fresh
and
lively
hops
forward
makes
a
nice
change
for
an
irish
red
unfortunately
the
hops
die
down
as
it
warms
and
it
starts
to
cloy
a
bit
d
one
of
the
best
irish
reds
ive
had
good
beer
very
enjoyable
poured
a
red
body
with
two
finger
head
that
dies
quickly
a
mix
of
bready
yeasty
malt
smells
along
with
hints
of
sour
hops
a
lowkey
blend
of
hops
and
yeasty
bready
malt
lead
to
a
dryer
beer
but
still
contains
some
caramel
malt
sweetness
for
an
easy
to
drink
balanced
red
great
to
sip
on
during
dinner
and
a
very
enjoyable
mellow
red
ale
d
ive
never
come
across
an
under
5
abv
beer
that
has
as
much
flavor
and
substance
as
this
one
does
this
is
a
true
session
beer
by
any
definition
and
puts
most
peers
ive
had
in
its
category
to
shame
i
could
drink
it
all
day
and
i
think
i
plan
to
this
st
patricks
day
md
pretty
good
tasting
import
out
of
ireland
first
time
having
this
and
was
pretty
impressed
very
smooth

i
very
good
session
brew
indeed
i
would
recommend
picking
up
some
and
i
will
for
sure
purchase
again

and
rasperries
up

with
a
tangy
malt
middle
and

slightly

low

an
excellent
session
beer
d
average
irish
red
i
would
purchase
again
found
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
bar
at
the
resevoir
inn
in
woodstock
ny
this
shows
a
nice
golden
brown
color
with
a
fair
white
head
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
very
mild
malty
grass
hop
the
flavor
brings
a
somewhat
thin
caramel
malt
with
wheat
overtones
its
nicely
carbonated
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
but
ultimately
there
isnt
alot
going
on
here
fair
malt
sweetness
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
but
kind
of
watery
the
caramel
builds
as
you
go
its
ok
but
i
dont
look
to
revisit
this
one
ruby
red
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
melts
to
soft
peaks
after
a
minute
or
two
the
nose
is
toasted
grain
and
mild
sweet
malt
good
toasty
malt
flavor
with
mild
hop
bitterness
to
balance
nicely
medium
light
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
pretty
wimpy
flavor
and
body
wise
i
guess
i
prefer
the
bigger
domestic
versions
of
the
style
drinkability
its
a
nice
beer
that
i
can
drink
all
night
no
problem
the
issues
is
i
wonder
if
its
correct
to
classify
it
as
an
irish
red
ale
its
taste
aroma
and
characteristics
make
me
wonder
about
that
however
overall
good
beer
nothing
too
special
but
not
that
bad
drinks
alright
id
say
theres
at
least
a
dozen
american
versions
i
prefer
nothing
special
here
imo
this
beer
pours
a
really
dark
mahogany
red
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
recedes
slowly
to
lacing
the
aroma
boasts
of
a
lot
of
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
the
roasted
caramel
that
comes
through
better
in
the
taste
the
medium
body
and
somewhat
agressive
carbonation
make
this
a
pretty
decent
drink
d
a
really
drinkable
irish
red
an
ok
representation
overall
i
think
this
might
have
been
because
of
the
age
but
this
beer
was
pretty
bad
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
reddish
tint
to
it
smell
is
somewhat
sweet
and
hints
of
caramel
taste
was
very
mild
and
much
less
flavorfull
than
i
expected
medium
texture
in
mouth
and
decent
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
a
rather
enjoyable
irish
red
one
of
the
more
robust
ones
ive
had
recommended
interesting
for
a
red
not
how
i
remember
them
pours
redish
black
with
a
cherry
tan
head
smells
of
cherries
and
hops
kind
of
fruity
tastes
a
bit
hoppy
a
hint
of
what
reminds
me
of
cherry
finishes
with
a
grassy
taste
not
unplesant
but
nothing
super
special
either
sort
of
lite
not
a
bad
taste
and
the
low
abv
make
it
fairly
drinkable
1x
okay
this
beer
was
pretty
different
poured
beautifully
smelled
excellent
but
the
taste
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
might
try
this
one
again
at
a
beer
pub
but
overall
i
was
not
impressed
and
did
not
find
my
new
go
to
irish
red
kinda
dissapointed
pours
a
dark
red
body
clear
huge
foamy
light
tan
head
pretty
lasting
english
malty
tasting
malty
some
bitterness
some
malt
roastiness
hard
to
describe
besides
british
some
nuttiness
too
roasted
malty
aroma
lots
of
malt
some
light
chocolate
too
d
things
started
out
well
for
this
beer
but
the
situation
went
downhill
as
i
drank
it
the
acidic
finish
and
hyper
carbonated
body
just
didnt
work
for
me
at
least
it
looks
and
smells
nice
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
simple
pure
clean
and
highly
sessionable
ill
gladly
share
a
pitcher
any
day
thanks
marikkas
d
good
solid
fuller
bodied
beer
that
has
a
good
drinkability
to
it
not
something
id
choose
to
put
back
all
night
though
a
pretty
beer
redbrown
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
that
resembled
whipped
cream
very
sticky
the
aroma
was
on
the
light
side
light
roasted
malt
and
some
fruit
lemony
taste
some
caramel
and
a
little
bitterness
at
the
end
a
pleasant
beer
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
my
second
oharas
the
1st
being
the
exceptional
stout
that
id
abandon
guinness
for
definitely
a
bit
less
than
my
expectations
sought
especially
since
i
had
it
in
ireland
albeit
canned
not
that
a
can
ruins
a
beer
the
pour
was
a
richer
red
brownamber
with
ruby
light
edging
it
out
the
head
was
decent
full
but
not
overwhelming
while
the
lace
stuck
to
the
glass
throughout
the
initial
aroma
expressed
a
malty
lemonbread
which
stayed
in
the
tasting
roasted
malts
toasted
bread
the
edge
of
lemon
towards
the
end
of
each
sip
not
too
sweet
and
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
this
red
was
superior
to
many
out
there
that
lack
any
complexity
a
good
basic
beer
a
shame
its
not
more
common
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
red
ive
ever
had
overall
a
solid
beer
though
personally
i
like
a
little
more
sweetness
out
of
my
irish
reds
the
sweet
smell
was
picked
up
in
the
taste
after
swallowing
the
sip
but
only
for
a
second
and
then
the
taste
disappears
it
is
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
without
being
light
in
flavor
nothing
exciting
here
but
it
is
a
solidly
drinkable
red
not
worth
the
10
buck
price
for
a
4pack
though
quite
drinkable
this
didnt
exactly
make
me
want
to
run
for
more
after
the
bottle
was
through
but
the
one
was
drinkable
it
could
use
more
allround
fullness
and
slightly
less
burntmetallic
touches
on
the
upside
it
does
have
balance
and
enough
smoothness
to
be
on
the
enjoyable
side
of
things
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
the
style
this
brew
pours
up
a
beautiful
crimson
color
with
a
decent
white
head
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
malts
some
sort
of
raw
malt
aroma
grains
i
suppose
it
has
a
distinct
scottishirish
aroma
to
it
the
taste
is
watered
down
bitter
malts
very
subtle
hops
a
crisp
brew
dry
finish
similar
mouthfeel
to
guinness
in
the
finish
that
rhymes
guinness
in
the
finish
guinness
in
the
finish
oh
ya
ya
ya
i
was
surprised
as
how
dark
this
brew
was
deep
brownish
red
with
a
solid
head
on
it
i
was
searching
for
the
toasted
malts
but
really
had
to
reach
to
find
that
flavor
decent
hop
profile
and
nebulous
malt
body
what
stood
out
more
than
anything
was
the
slightly
metallic
flavor
that
hit
me
at
times
i
was
a
litte
disappointed
given
how
good
their
stout
was
glad
i
tried
it
once
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
d
drink
drink
it
up
easy
as
can
be
if
you
enjoy
the
unique
flavor
low
alcohol
means
that
this
beer
could
be
had
throughout
the
night
this
is
a
great
choice
for
a
bbq
in
the
back
yard
with
friends
during
early
fall
this
beer
has
a
very
smooth
taste
and
feel
to
it
it
has
distinct
malt
flavors
but
is
mellow
with
no
after
taste
the
alcohol
content
on
this
is
lower
but
based
on
alcohol
content
its
got
great
taste
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
poured
an
appealing
grade
a
maple
sugar
brown
one
finger
head
of
cream
colored
head
fades
to
a
tiny
bubbled
ring
not
much
retention
but
some
lacing
smells
are
a
little
subtle
but
like
the
flavors
appealing
lightly
floral
hops
assorted
dry
grains
the
appearance
is
great
overall
palate
is
a
bit
malt
heavy
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
slightly
herbaceous
and
sour
medium
carbonation
is
too
feisty
to
makes
the
beer
as
smooth
as
it
wants
to
be
same
problem
their
stout
has
sadly
the
appearance
is
the
best
part
of
this
brew
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
the
famously
proud
irish
should
tout
drinkability
it
is
alright
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
drinkability
very
watery
and
thin
everything
seems
muted
so
its
drinkable
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
beer
too
much
everything
seems
sort
of
muted
and
nondescript
it
wasnt
really
refreshing
or
complex
or
well
anything
really
not
recommended
the
drink
is
mediumbodied
crisp
mild
and
clean
with
superb
drinkability
d
a
great
irish
red
with
unique
smokiness
and
good
feel
pretty
expensive
though
in
the
bottle
d
nothing
affirmatively
wrong
with
this
beer
but
it
is
not
particularly
special
in
opinion
low
enough
abv
to
session
with
i
suppose
but
just
not
enough
of
interest
in
the
taste
the
aroma
is
of
butterscotch
along
with
fruits
cherry
the
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
tiny
hop
flavor
on
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
easy
to
drink
this
one
but
there
is
nothing
all
that
special
d
not
terrible
but
not
very
good
either
i
really
cant
find
any
faults
other
than
a
vague
sour
flavor
but
i
really
just
dont
like
this
beer
all
that
much
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
right
drinkability
is
fine
could
have
really
benefited
if
it
were
more
flavorful
not
bad
though
kind
of
like
this
beer
poured
with
a
nice
head
which
mostly
dissapated
and
some
lace
good
reddish
amber
color
mild
malty
and
roasty
aroma
with
little
hops
perhaps
a
little
fizzy
in
the
mouth
which
also
leads
to
a
sharpness
on
the
tongue
still
its
not
overly
sweet
and
is
drinkable
it
gets
even
better
as
it
warms
a
bit
d
overall
a
dry
earthy
red
with
a
moderate
drinkability
a
refreshing
clean
and
true
to
style
red
ale
a
great
session
beer
even
if
the
price
is
a
little
higher
than
your
normal
session
i
will
pick
this
one
out
again
on
an
warm
weather
irish
day
verdict
i
really
like
this
beer
its
sessionable
drinkable
and
it
goes
down
very
well
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
if
i
could
find
it
in
a
pub
setting
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
nice
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
caramel
brown
sugar
toffee
and
a
hint
of
grapefruit
the
taste
is
a
little
hoppier
than
other
irish
red
ales
i
have
had
but
it
is
more
well
balanced
because
of
it
there
is
a
nice
interplay
between
the
sweet
malt
and
this
floral
hops
that
lasts
long
into
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
bodied
with
nice
refreshing
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
irish
red
ale
and
a
great
session
beer
too
i
will
certainly
drink
this
again
i
could
see
this
being
a
wonderful
beer
on
a
nice
spring
day
this
was
a
good
beer
across
the
board
when
you
think
of
irish
red
wonderfully
sweet
with
a
nice
tartness
goes

at

night
a

weeks

the
beer
poured
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
1
finger
of
head
that
fell
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
was
slight
caramel
and
slight
roasted
not
anything
special
the
flavor
was
a
little
better
than
the
nose
and
pleasantly
drinakble
not

good
as
a

out

overall
boring
and
mass
produced
but
not

bad
i
get
a
toffey
taste
from
it
or
maybe
its
caramel
to
me
it
is
a
refreshing
taste
from
all
the
floral
taste
out
there
i
would
recommend
it
to
my
friends
very
smooth
it
goes
with
just
about
any
meal
for
dinner
great
beer
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
still
has
lots
of
flavour
one
of
my
favorites
not
sure
what
to
say
here
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
recommend
either
go
with
murphys
red
if
you
have
a
choice
while
it
may
lack
the
depth
of
taste
of
a
truly
good
craft
beer
it
remains
one
of
my
gateway
beers
to
the
craft
scene
after
not
having
one
in
a
while
its
still
a
good
beer
especially
at
an
irish
theme
bar
a
decent
beer
a
serious
brew
head
would
give
it
a
low
score
but
it
is
a
good
adventure
beer
for
folks
looking
for
something
light
but
different
the
rest
decent
body
and
carbonation
but
fairly
unremarkable
otherwise
it
lacks
a
robust
appealing
malt
profile
this
is
much
to
grainy
tasting

othe
beer
could
be
summed
up
with
one
word
and
that
word
is
okay
12oz

i
havent
had
a
smithwicks
in
probably
ten
years
now
i
know
why
boring
aroma
and
flavor
both
were
grainy
and
forgettable
deep
red
color
i
would
likely
never
buy
another
one
of
these
unless
i
was
actually
in
ireland
sampled
on
tap
at
a
scottish
ale
house
serving
mostly
irish
and
local
brews
a
red
to
dark
chalky
brown
ale
with
some
light
butterscotch
foam
astonishingly
little
in
the
way
of
aroma
maybe
a
hint
of
dried
dark
fruit
raisin
and
toffee
but
largely
flat
on
the
nose
taste
was
mellow
toast
dilute
caramel
sauce
slight
hop
bitterness
little
of
the
tealike
smooth
bitterness
and
body
of
other
irish
reds
watery
and
thin
lingering
sweet
finish
with
a
little
cardboard
unobjectionable
but
insipid
has
a
lovely
red
brown
color
advertized
as
a

thin
head
on
draft
in

almost
no

my
nose
is
plugged
up
a
very
disappointing
taste
mildly
citrys
little
hops
no

very
fizzy
almost
like
a
cola
im
glad
to
have
sampled
it
but
i
wont
be
trying
it
again
at

were

have
a
bitter
aftertaste
smithwick
irish
ale
satisfies
long
after
the
swallow
the
only
problem
i
have
with
this
ale
is
locating
it
i
try
to
buy
as
many
sixpacks
as
i
can
when
i
locate
it
on
the
shelves
nevertheless
eventually
the
stores
seem
to
just
stop
stocking
this
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
looks
and
tastes
like
a
excellent
craft
beer
should
not
too
hoppy
no
strong
odor
or
bitter
aftertaste
drinkable
and
smooth
no
comparison
to
guiness
as
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
not
heavy
like
guiness
extra
stout
great
history
of
brewery
as
well
o
this
was
a
light
beer
nuetral
no
hops
or
malt
then
with
black
patent
added
i
would
not
buy
again
my
pour
produced
better
than
two
fingers
worth
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
great
retention
in
todays
heat
and
humidity
it
looked
like
the
top
of
a
coffee
ice
cream
cone
color
was
a
deep
copperyred
with
nequality
clarity
the
shade
that
makes
me
swoon
when
it
is
on
a
woman
nose
was
malty
fairly
sweet
nothing
terribly
remarkable
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
and
other
than
a
mild
sweetness
it
really
lacked
ooomph
of
any
sort
it
was
not
bad
just
lacking
finish
was
equally
hohum
i
hate
to
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
but
this
was
not
doing
anything
for
me
overall
an
average
red
ale
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
it
again
especially
in
hotter
days
but
it
is
not
unforgettable
taste
is
mild
and
malty
again
with
the
hops
coming
in
near
the
finish
overall
a
very
plain
and
unremarkable
even
forgettable
ale
wont
pursue
this
one
again
anytime
soon
it
pours
a
reddish
brown
in
color
with
a
light
foam
head
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
with
some
hints
of
earth
and
nut
the
beer
flavor
is
pretty
simple
and
clean
there
is
a
slight
hoppiness
to
the
finish
which
is
really
the
most
distinguishing
characteristic
aside
from
the
nose
its
okay
but
with
a
whole
world
of
beer
out
there
to
try
i
am
not
sure
when
or
if
i
will
drink
it
again
the
body
is
light
with
a
slight
dry
finish
as
mentioned
clean
and
crisp
overall
this
is
kind
of
like
a
hybrid
amberlager
with
limited
taste
overall
very
easy
to
drink
and
easily
attainable
in
ireland
this
is
one
delicious
ale
arrives
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
finger
head
that
doesnt
go
away
for
a
while
and
leaves
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
pretty
bitter
up
front
and
so
does
it
taste
but
it
goes
down
smooth
and
the
faint
taste
of
bread
is
what
is
left
on
your
tongue
on
the
end
i
love
the
irish
reds
and
one
brewed
in
the
emerald
isle
will
always
get
my
taste
buds
attention
this
is
my
favorite
of
all
the
bottled
redheads
ive
had
through
the
years
i
enjoy
just
about
everything
this
beer
has
to
offer
the
color
aroma
and
taste
are
all
outstanding
only
the
aftertaste
maybe
something
to
do
with
the
bottling
process
could
be
a
little
better
in
my
book
taste
malted
and
mild
not
bitter
at
all
a
distant
hint
of
hops
d
drinks
ok
nothing
special
ive
had
better
reds
on
tap
at
the
irish
bar
and
restaurant
grasshopper
too
in
wayne
nj
pours
very
dark
black
with
a
good
amount
of
head
smells
sweet
a
bit
of
clove
very
roasty
very
easy
to
drink
dark
sweet
caramel
taste
very
malty
a
little
bit
of
hoppiness
but
not
very
noticeable
a
little
watery
but
the
irish
should
be
proud
this
is
a
fantastic
effort
d
malts
and
flattish
feel
could
get
tiresome
but
certainly
nothing
offensive
better
than
many
of
its
style
pours
nicely
with
a
medium
head
with
light
lace
neither
of
which
lasted
very
long
medium
dark
amber
color
no
real
nose
for
me
to
appreciate
taste
slightly
sweet
mellow
hop
no
overtly
carbonated
immediately
gave
a
flat
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
but
still
pleasant
i
found
this
brew
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
not
very
heavy
drinkable
if
you
actually
like
it
a
little
on
the
wrong
side
of
average
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
better
than
a
lot
of
other
macros
but
you
can
find
better
beers
overall
not
bad
beats
up
on
domestics
very
drinkable
not
too
heavy
smithwicks
is
an
easy
beer
to
find
in
the
usa
and
it
is
common
to
see
it
on
the
store
shelves
in
many
stores
even
small
carryouts
but
smithwicks
while
certainly
acceptable
is
a
little
on
the
boring
side
with
a
taste
that
attempts
to
be
complex
but
that
doesnt
offer
enough
body
or
character
to
reach
its
full
potential
it
is
also
a
tad
overpriced
too
and
i
can
think
of
many
beers
that
taste
better
and
cost
less
still
the
taste
is
good
enough
to
imbibe
a
few
bottles
when
there
is
nothing
better
available
good
clean
appearance
with
a
decent
head
malt
smells
with
definate
but
modest
hints
of
apples
slightly
bitter
taste
was
expecting
a
little
more
carbonation
was
light
which
was
what
i
was
expecting
overall
was
a
decent
beer
but
one
that
was
just
average
the
pint
came
a
dark
caramel
brown
color
with
a
wispy
head
aroma
is
light
with
a
generic
maltiness
coming
through
fairly
light
caramel
and
toffee
on
the
palate
no
hop
or
bitterness
to
mention
a
fairly
light
flavored
beer
but
refreshing
nonetheless
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
that
i
would
i
feel
that
i
could
have
had
a
few
more
and
will
be
buyingordering
this
beer
again
the
taste
is
similar
mostly
lightly
sweet
darkbready
with
hints
of
burnt
caramel
and
earth
it
has
only
a
faint
hint
of
bitterness
its
somewhat
bland
and
onedimensional
thinning
out
at
the
end
tasted
061607
drinks
easy
though
and
makes
for
a
better
session
beer
than
many
other
mass
brews
thiner
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
but
a
good
if
not
great
beer
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
irish
red
ale
style
but
i
prefer
the
draught
version
drinkability
it
definitely
left
me
wanting
more
this
will
be
an
excellent
afternoon
bbq
beer
or
a
great
one
with
a
snack
and
a
good
ballgame
smithwicks
has
good
balance
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
the
full
body
complimented
the
tightbubbled
head
that
left
a
great
deal
of
lace
on
the
glass
frankly
i
expected
far
less
the
only
distraction
might
be
the
lack
of
aroma
but
i
find
this
to
be
commonplace
amongst
those
poured
in
a
barby
the
time
the
beer
arrives
the
smell
is
nearly
gone
d
drinkability
is
surprising
easy
and
quite
good
i
really
enjoy
the
minerality
in
the
water
and
the
sweet
toasted
malt
lacing
in
the
finish
of
this
beer
decent
per
style
i
wont
be
drinking
this
stuff
again
if
the
flavor
were
more
enjoyable
this
would
be
a
solid
session
brew
as
for
now
i
think
ill
pass
this
is
a
decent
ale
it
poured
with
a
good
sized
head
and
left
nice
lacing
in
the
glass
it
smelled
faintly
of
sweet
malts
the
taste
was
pleasing
and
balanced
but
a
bit
muted
a
touch
more
hops
and
a
stronger
malt
backing
would
make
it
a
lot
more
interesting
a
good
everyday
ale
if
a
bit
pedestrian
dfairly
drinkable
not
really
anything
to
write
home
about
from
a
bottle
this
poured
a
copper
to
brown
color
with
a
nice
fat
tan
head
and
good
lacing
nose
of
nuts
caramel
malts
and
toffee
is
present
smooth
mouthfeel
flavor
is
sweet
with
touches
of
malts
and
light
hops
and
the
finish
is
dry
decent
irish
ale
nice
aroma
slighty
sweet
and
malty
tastes
similar
and
has
a
nice
off
white
creamy
head
delicious
very
easy
to
drink
with
almost
no
hoppy
bitterness
whatsoever
very
smooth
aftertaste
drank
on
draught
at
2
locations
in
austin
the
first
was
definitely
less
carbonated
than
the
second
locations
yet
it
is
still
a
lightly
carbonated
beer
either
way
would
definitely
get
again
and
enjoyed
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
my
first
true
irish
red
pours
a
med
ruddybrown
color
w
a
thin
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
in
my
pint
glass
a
faint
burnt
caramelish
aroma
no
hops
to
speak
of
a
little
on
the
thin
side
theres
a
crisp
caramel
maltlike
flavor
at
first
followed
by
a
slight
floral
hop
bite
w
some
nutty
undertones
similar
in
taste
to
an
eng
mild
brown
with
less
hops
a
light
almost
watery
body
w
a
modest
amount
of
co2
would
be
dry
if
not
for
the
wet
taste
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
a
good
style
example
though
im
not
too
familiar
w
the
style
but
i
could
knock
back
a
lot
of
this
final
statement
pretty
bland
mass
produced
irish
red
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
remember
it
being
better
3
or
4
years
ago
a
dark
ice
tea
color
brew
with
a
thin
but
sturdy
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
light
chocolate
malt
the
flavor
suggests
some
charcoal
and
malt
it
is
finely
carbonated
with
a
peppery
sense
at
the
front
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
background
a
little
acqueous
still
a
solid
choice
mellow
and
quite
drinkable
had
beer
at
a
ball
game
where
other
guiness
ales
also
available
dark
amber
color
with
nice
white
creamy
head
that
it
stayed
for
a
good
while
aroma
is
mild
nice
full
flavor
that
is
similar
to
smell
nothing
spectacular
but
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
good
and
aftertaste
stays
full
pours
nice
amber
color
with
small
creamy
head
that
it
retained
for
a
good
while
aroma
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
but
pulled
roasted
malt
and
some
caramel
from
it
decent
flavor
that
is
similar
to
smell
nothing
spectacular
but
extremely
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
thin
lacing
was
minimal
great
irish
beer
good
deep
red
colour
finger
thick
head
that
lasted
for
quite
a
while
it
has
a
real
mellow
ale
taste
good
mouthfeel
i
had
it
multiple
times
in
ireland
and
each
time
was
as
good
as
the
last
it
definitly
leaves
you
wanting
another
pint
i
recently
tried
this
on
tap
at
a
local
toronto
eatery
and
found
it
to
be
an
alright
brew
the
colour
was
a
brownish
colour
slightly
dark
with
an
offwhite
head
that
didnt
stay
long
the
aroma
was
slightly
malty
and
sweet
but
weak
the
flavour
was
slightly
malty
at
the
start
but
became
better
as
i
got
closer
to
the
bottom
like
other
ales
i
have
tried
it
was
thick
on
the
tongue
with
little
carbonation
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
when
provided
a
list
on
tap
if
ive
previously
tried
them
all
occassionally
ill
pick
this
one
pours
a
beautiful
translucent
brownred
with
a
very
thick
and
persistent
head
pleasant
aroma
is
mostly
malty
but
has
some
hoppy
hints
flavor
is
more
malty
than
hoppy
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
caramel
a
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
ale
definitely
worthy
of
ones
time
and
money
d
decent
beer
to
drink
one
after
the
other
not
great
but
easy
to
wash
down
some
irish
food
pretty
refreshing
ale
drinkability
a
good
drinker
i
got
2
sixes
on
sale
for
st
pattys
day
and
had
two
left
to
review
i
liked
it
i
was
a
change
of
the
usual
irish
dry
stouts
i
guzzle
on
the
17th
from
what
i
understand
this
imported
us
version
has
slightly
higher
abv
i
would
love
to
try
the
lighter
version
and
just
drink
the
day
with
this
beer
d
other
than
just
trying
out
the
bottled
version
for
petes
sake
i
dont
think
ill
ever
order
this
or
even
drink
on
a
weekend
afternoon
brew
d
good
session
brew
if
you
just
want
to
slake
your
thirst
or
get
drunk
at
an
irish
pub
good
irish
bar
brew
for
nonbas
that
have
a
fear
of
the
dark
and
want
to
stay
away
from
guiness
i
got
this
on
tap
at
tommy
condons
in
charleston
sc
though
not
bad
in
any
aspect
i
found
this
to
be
very
average
nothing
exciting
or
original
in
any
of
the
characteristics
although
it
is
quite
smooth
and
this
improves
its
drinkablility
it
has
a
light
bready
taste
with
a
dry
finish
lightbodied
but
the
lightness
causes
a
lack
of
flavor
can
neither
complain
nor
reccommend
overall
it
was
not
my
favorite
not
complex
enough
or
well
enough
developed
twodimentional
beer
at
best
but
im
sure
its
a
decent
pick
if
you
like
this
style
pours
a
good
two
finger
off
white
head
which
leaves
about
a
quarter
inch
at
the
finish
dark
brown
in
color
smell
is
like
fresh
bread
taste
is
caramel
or
brown
sugar
all
malt
light
smooth
very
nice
drinkability
is
very
good
something
everyone
can
enjoy
16
oz
can
poured
well
carbonated
into
a
tall
glass
with
a
good
white
head
and
no
foam
fall
aroma
was
of
strong
hops
and
the
first
sip
confirmed
it
very
bitter
malty
character
flavors
with
some
oaky
flavors
and
even
some
pine
essence
but
not
enough
to
overcome
the
bitter
hops
nothing
that
really
sticks
out
as
great
but
nothing
that
detracts
its
a
good
drink
that
goes
down
smooth
and
fast
and
a
beer
my
wife
can
enjoy
too
not
the
beer
im
looking
for
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
import
beers
we
have
available
in
our
province
run
liquor
monopoly
im
pretty
impressed
with
the
beers
that
are
associated
with
guiness
guiness
itself
is
usually
quite
good
on
tap
harp
is
one
of
my
favourite
euro
lagers
and
smithwicks
is
quite
enjoyable
as
well
im
not
a
big
kilkenny
fan
but
its
better
on
tap
than
in
the
can
coming
from
a
large
scale
brewer
like
this
these
are
really
good
quality
beers
i
hadnt
had
this
in
years
but
its
about
as
i
remembered
a
good
session
beer
but
kind
of
bland
looks
a
nice
red
with
a
creamy
head
and
lacing
smells
watery
however
like
an
inoffensive
macro
taste
is
a
little
weak
but
still
nice
a
touch
creamy
in
flavor
with
burnt
caramel
watery
mouthfeel
but
easy
to
drink
a
tasty
drink
but
you
might
as
well
just
order
yourself
a
pitcher
as
it
goes
down
fast
d
not
bad
but
a
little
blandboring
on
tap
it
had
a
good
head
and
a
dark
brown
color
it
smelled
malty
and
slightly
sweet
it
tasted
a
little
bitter
with
a
blend
of
caramel
and
malt
mouthfeel
was
quite
soft
and
creamy
it
wasnt
too
heavy
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
my
first
ever
smithwicks
cheers
drinkability
i
do
think
this
is
a
solid
brew
and
id
drink
it
again
i
dont
know
the
6pack
price
or
anything
but
this
went
down
very
easily
and
went
very
well
with
my
bangers
and
some
of
the
spiciness
of
that
maybe
not
the
best
ira
but
id
drink
more
of
this
certainly
in
my
opinion
this
is
something
that
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
which
i
probably
will
with
the
multitude
of
bbqs
this
summer
i
recommend
it
to
those
who
like
a
mild
smooth
taste
of
an
ale
and
yes
goes
great
with
any
bbq
i
wont
buy
this
again
no
point
good
amount
of
carbonation
enough
malty
taste
to
fit
the
amber
style
very
light
hops
with
almost
no
aftertaste
easy
drinking
session
beer
a
bit
more
malt
and
it
would
be
good
as
is
its
decent
better
than
some
but
not
the
best
this
beer
pours
a
copper
red
with
a
very
frothy
off
white
head
it
smells
like
irish
yeast
with
other
mild
maltiness
the
taste
is
also
very
malty
with
some
hop
bitterness
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
nice
and
thick
and
overall
its
not
a
bad
irish
ale
but
i
would
have
to
take
a
highland
gaelic
over
this
one
any
day
pours
a
thickheaded
big
and
bubbly
head
with
a
strange
muted
translucent
brownish
hue
for
a
red
ale
left
a
creamy
dolop
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
mild
lightly
grassy
and
of
sweet
malt
taste
is
balanced
and
outstanding
for
a
macro
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
but
only
in
balance
with
the
full
malt
taste
smooth
sweetish
tea
like
and
definitely
uk
style
better
than
newcastle
for
sure
but
it
has
a
rather
unique
taste
it
doesnt
seem
like
it
would
be
difficult
to
imitate
and
beat
this
but
ive
as
of
yet
had
a
craft
brewery
that
tried
and
suceeds
in
this
style
id
return
here
and
know
it
would
win
at
a
party
nothing
ill
buy
regularly
but
id
be
excited
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
cheers
light
and
fizzy
on
the
palate
with
no
discernable
hop
bitterness
or
floralfruit
mouthfeel
only
slightly
bitter
malt
is
more
firmly
planted
as
primary
flavor
mediocre
at
best
an
irish
macro
ale
drinkablilty
i
thought
it
was
refreshing
could
drink
one
or
two
easy
drinking
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
well
i
could
see
this
being
pounded
back
by
someone
getting
drunk
at
a
bar
but
to
actually
drink
for
the
pleasure
ill
pass
i
paid
way
too
much
for
the
sixpack
hopefully
they
were
just
sticking
it
to
me
right
before
st
patricks
day
indeed
the
reason
i
sought
it
out
as
opposed
to
that
being
an
extra
buck
and
a
halfi
can
expect
to
pay
for
this
when
i
go
looking
for
it
again
which
i
will
drinkability
these
go
down
pretty
good
nice
on
st
paddys
day
but
theres
not
enough
going
on
to
warrant
another
purchase
not
too
bad
i
got
it
on
sale
for
7
i
would
buy
again
at
that
price
but
not
the
normal
10
i
usually
see
it
for
d
i
dont
know
if
id
have
this
again
but
its
certainly
easier
to
drink
than
guinness
yes
i
am
a
weakling
smitchwicks
pours
out
a
copper
color
with
a
small
head
i
detected
absolutely
no
aroma
in
this
beer
i
stuck
my
nose
so
far
in
that
i
inhaled
foam
but
i
never
smelled
a
thing
the
flavor
is
quite
watery
with
a
bit
of
caramel
there
is
some
metallic
flavor
a
hint
of
hops
comes
in
at
the
finish
i
cant
really
call
this
beer
bad
but
it
has
almost
no
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
without
the
creaminess
i
was
hoping
for
not
something
ill
be
wasting
my
time
with
again
drinkability
flavorful
but
not
demanding
wellbalanced
and
easytodrink
i
liked
it
more
than
i
expected
happy
st
patricks
day
picked
up
a
six
at
a
local
ingles
for
7
97
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
just
a
little
light
dry
malt
taste
was
a
disapointment
too
faint
pale
roasted
malt
with
little
hop
bitterness
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
would
prefer
a
killians
over
this
way
over
priced
on
the
label
it
says
from
a
recipe
inspired
by
john
smithwick
ill
bet
if
john
had
one
of
these
he
would
be
pissed
to
have
his
name
on
the
label
light
sweetness
up
front
sting
sizzle
pop
carbonation
in
the
middle
and
soft
lingering
malts
to
finish
reminds
me
of
something
gordon
biersch
would
make
forgettable
for
the
most
part
musings
bought
a
12
pack
of
this
because
of
a
spd
sale
its
drinkable
but
i
wont
be
going
back
anytime
soon
aroma
is
dissapointingly
light
just
a
light
malty
aroma
but
nothing
really
jumping
out
at
me
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
not
a
ton
of
flavor
just
a
bit
of
malt
and
grain
with
a
smooth
flavor
front
to
back
nothing
jumping
out
or
off
balance
finishes
fairly
dry
i
was
expecting
more
malty
flavor
from
an
irish
ale
this
one
is
a
bit
light
on
flavor
and
a
somewhat
overly
dry
finish
cheers
the
mouth
feel
is
light
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
over
all
smithwicks
is
an
okay
beer
other
reds
ive
had
seem
a
little
sweeter
still
goes
down
easy
and
is
quite
drinkable
id
probably
say
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
maybe
good
for
the
golf
course
first
time
i
have
had
this
style
i
hope
there
are
better
ones
out
there
i
bought
this
in
a
6pack
at
a
local
store
which
occasionally
has
a
few
importedbeers
of
note
would
i
buy
this
beer
at
a
bar
yes
probably
but
if
they
had
this
to
offer
theyd
probably
be
offering
others
that
would
tempt
me
more
greatly
appearance
was
dark
brownamber
w
a
good
sized
head
and
nice
consistent
lacing
not
much
to
speak
of
as
far
as
smell
goes
but
it
is
sligthly
sweet
as
is
the
taste
spikes
of
smoky
caramel
touch
the
taste
buds
i
found
the
mouthfeel
totally
enjoyable
definitely
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
night
i
actually
tried
this
for
the
first
time
from
a
chilis
that
was
offering
2fers
i
got
one
guinness
and
one
of
these
guinness
is
one
of
my
favs
but
i
took
an
immediate
liking
to
smithwicks
this
wont
blow
anybody
away
but
its
a
totally
enjoyable
beer
and
i
hope
it
continues
to
become
popular
here
in
the
states
i
guess
this
is
the
new
in
beer
for
our
area
its
popping
up
in
all
my
usual
hangouts
after
tasting
it
im
not
impressed
its
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
some
nice
lacing
it
had
a
weak
toasty
odor
and
tasted
of
grain
with
some
slight
hoppiness
i
really
didnt
appreciate
much
flavor
an
average
beer
as
far
as
beers
go
this
one
struck
me
as
very
unimpressive
to
look
at
as
soon
as
i
poured
i
was
overcome
by
the
head
which
at
one
point
was
about
half
the
glass
the
color
is
a
maple
amber
crystal
clear
and
with
tons
of
carbonation
on
the
sides
and
bottom
of
the
glass
it
looked
more
like
a
root
beer
or
maybe
a
foodcolored
macro
the
head
only
looked
pleasant
once
it
had
died
down
to
about
half
a
centimeter
and
actually
left
a
good
deal
of
lace
the
smell
was
metallic
off
the
bat
although
i
was
able
to
uncover
some
hidden
honey
malts
with
a
touch
of
hops
after
some
searching
the
taste
was
a
bit
watery
although
this
would
probably
be
the
strongest
point
of
the
beer
it
is
unimpressive
on
the
front
of
the
pallate
but
it
divulges
a
few
malty
flavors
on
the
back
released
by
the
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
high
in
carbonation
and
watery
drinkable
fine
for
a
round
or
two
but
you
wont
see
me
drinking
the
night
away
with
this
this
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
smallish
head
the
smell
has
a
slight
malt
aromabut
it
is
pretty
weak
the
taste
is
all
malt
sweetness
with
a
slight
hop
presence
the
mf
is
light
and
pretty
well
balancedbut
this
is
just
an
average
beer
at
best
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
recedes
to
a
spotty
lace
smells
malty
grainy
and
like
buttered
biscuits
taste
is
very
heavy
on
the
malts
with
a
toastlike
finish
feels
thin
in
the
mouth
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
pay
my
hard
earned
money
for
if
it
was
free
i
would
gladly
accept
though
fairly
drinkable
brownred
ale
maybe
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
still
a
good
beer
edit
i
let
the
beer
warm
up
some
more
after
my
initial
comments
and
found
the
caramel
character
to
be
more
evident
and
more
enjoyable
i
bumped
up
my
score
to
reflect
this
but
i
still
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
to
scream
from
the
rooftops
about
decent
drinkability
but
overall
not
too
impressed
a
beer
that
pours
way
better
than
it
drinks
this
beer
really
did
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
i
thought
it
would
be
a
lot
better
it
is
the
color
of
iced
tea
there
is
a
decent
sized
head
the
smell
is
similar
to
a
light
beer
the
taste
could
use
some
improvment
there
is
quite
a
bite
to
it
i
will
not
buy
this
again
there
are
much
better
options
for
red
beer
than
this
this
seems
to
be
slightly
different
less
flavorful
and
more
carbonated
than
i
remember
having
it
while
on
an
ireland
trip
a
few
years
ago
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
malt
and
faint
hops
not
at
all
exciting
nor
complex
but
certainly
not
offensive
ill
let
my
next
bottle
get
closer
to
room
temp
and
if
there
are
any
noteworthy
changes
in
my
opinion
of
this
brew
ill
edit
my
review
as
it
stands
now
this
just
lacks
the
flavour
that
i
was
hoping
for
in
a
uk
session
ale
too
bad
not
a
good
first
pint
for
any
country
in
my
opinion
i
probably
wont
be
sampling
this
again
any
time
soon
not
recommended
not
bad
makes
a
decent
session
beer
but
not
the
tastiest
one
good
caramel
flavor
with
decent
drinkability
recommended
pours
a
deep
amberred
with
a
reddish
tinged
head
that
builds
to
about
one
finger
before
dissipating
fairly
quickly
and
leaving
little
lacing
smells
of
caramel
and
coffee
with
malts
and
sweetness
apparent
taste
is
a
bit
medicinal
with
the
caramel
muted
by
a
phenolic
overtone
that
puts
a
damper
on
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
with
slight
carbonation
drinkability
is
solid
but
not
that
impressive
this
is
pretty
good
seems
to
go
well
with
pub
grub
and
other
heavy
british
isles
food
overall
a
pretty
typical
ale
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
lovely
amber
color
good
clarity
fruity
slightly
hoppy
nose
initial
mouthfeel
was
very
full
malty
lots
of
nonfermentable
sugar
feel
but
then
finished
as
a
clear
amber
lager
a
good
session
beer
one
id
like
to
stock
up
on
if
the
price
is
right
pours
a
bronzish
copper
with
good
clarity
two
light
tan
fingers
of
dense
bubbles
retain
well
and
leaves
some
stubborn
patches
of
lacing
lightly
toasted
pilsener
and
caramel
in
the
nose
theres
also
a
whiff
of
hops
that
seem
both
noble
and
citrusy
nice
blend
of
crystal
malt
sweetness
and
pilsener
spice
but
the
malt
profile
is
still
lacking
for
the
style
the
citrus
and
faint
noble
hop
aftertaste
dominates
the
flavor
with
no
herbal
taste
detectable
airy
body
is
light
but
not
thin
and
a
high
level
carbonation
keep
a
crisp
mouthfeel
but
it
retains
some
texture
without
becomeing
diacetyl
finishes
mostly
clean
but
more
like
an
apa
deep
garnetmahogany
in
color
no
real
head
to
speak
of
nose
is
a
little
too
subtle
metallic
peat
with
a
hint
of
smoke
flavor
is
even
more
subtle
metallic
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
smoked
bread
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
highly
carbonated
another
underwhelming
brew
from
the
british
isles
sadly
in
my
experience
they
tend
to
be
watered
down
and
lacking
in
character
nothing
that
id
particularly
seek
out
again
though
it
made
an
adequate
substitute
for
water
with
my
meal
this
beer
came
amber
brown
with
slight
reddish
hue
smelled
of
sweet
and
dry
sour
malts
a
bit
like
bleached
flour
tasted
of
a
good
smokey
sour
malt
a
bit
of
molasses
and
a
nice
sour
coffee
finish
there
was
a
nice
combo
of
sharp
contrasts
in
the
flavor
between
the
smooth
brown
alelike
malt
and
a
sharp
hops
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
slick
and
creamy
nice
flavor
in
this
beer
very
smooth
with
a
nice
assertive
flavor
ill
look
for
this
one
again
the
flavor
can
best
be
described
as
delicious
lighter
in
flavor
than
most
beers
of
this
color
and
at
only
4
5
alcohol
you
can
go
ahead
and
put
a
couple
of
these
back
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
i
cant
say
ill
ever
have
another
take
your
time
and
enjoy
this
one
i
bet
it
goes
really
well
with
a
porterhouse
with
carmalized
onions
and
some
buttery
greens
d
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
nothing
to
slow
you
down
no
overt
complexity
just
nice
taste
and
relatively
low
abv
for
what
it
is
its
pretty
decent
if
its
available
have
a
couple
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
and
get
some
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
though
ive
had
better
nevertheless
i
found
this
beer
to
be
delicious
and
satisfying
this
irish
ale
is
dark
redbrown
in
color
and
pours
with
a
rich
thick
head
a
high
level
of
carbonation
creates
a
sparkle
of
effervescence
on
the
tongue
a
crisp
somewhat
astringent
hoppiness
characterizes
this
beer
along
with
a
rich
midpalate
malty
sweetness
notes
of
harvest
apples
spice
and
molasses
make
way
for
a
lingering
sweet
aftertaste
everyone
sitting
with
me
at
my
table
tried
this
and
everyone
nonbeer
drinkers
included
was
very
impressed
this
is
now
my
goto
beer
this
beer
is
good
overall
its
not
a
very
strong
irish
ale
like
george
killians
but
it
is
a
different
kind
of
beer
its
a
bit
thick
but
not
guinness
extra
stout
a
bit
sweet
appearance
and
smell
are
better
than
average
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
i
could
drink
smithwicks
daily
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
irish
imports
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
one
out
drinkability

the
drinking
experience
was
rather
uneventful
but
theres
nothing
here
that
will
activate
your
gag
reflex
not
too
bad
left
a
strange
aftertaste
though
i
dont
see
myself
buying
again
this
beer
poured
a
reddish
copper
orange
color
that
was
crystal
clear
and
well
carbonated
the
head
was
pure
white
in
color
semidense
and
thick
but
not
long
lasting
it
fell
quickly
to
just
a
ring
on
the
edges
no
lace
seemed
to
be
present
the
aromas
were
fairly
simple
malts
lots
of
caramels
light
hops
and
a
creamy
fresh
butter
tones
the
tastes
were
much
like
the
aromas
caramels
malts
seemed
there
were
more
hops
present
in
the
taste
then
the
nose
seemed
some
sweetness
slips
in
and
out
bitter
cocoa
semed
present
on
the
swallow
then
ended
up
with
a
grainy
taste
the
body
was
on
the
light
side
an
ok
beer
but
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
other
irish
reds
i
would
suggest
doing
so
decent
stands
up
but
not
really
noticed
a
decent
session
beer
if
nothing
better
but
there
were
plenty
of
things
better
at
the
bar
where
i
had
this
the
mac
jacks
amber
i
had
before
this
would
be
a
far
better
choice
for
session
drinking
tasted
very
average
creamy
and
smooth
but
just
lacking
i
would
buy
it
for
the
nostalgic
value
not
for
the
taste
man
i
wish
i
could
travel
back
in
time
and
have
that
beer
in
kilkenny
pours
dark
amber
with
2
fingered
beige
head
a
little
lace
light
sweet
malt
aroma
medium
body
and
dextrinous
mouthfeel
flavors
malt
and
caramel
and
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
not
what
you
expect
from
an
irish
ale
makes
you
wonder
what
changes
it
has
undergone
since
its
ownership
by
guinness
swithwicks
ale
pours
to
a
beautiful
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
eventually
fades
and
a
moderate
to
soft
amount
of
carbonation
the
nose
on
this
beer
is
wonderful
with
lots
of
soft
sweet
malty
aromas
paired
with
flowery
hops
and
light
touches
of
plummy
estery
fruit
the
palate
is
soft
and
buttery
with
lots
of
good
sweet
malt
flavors
biscuity
malt
a
touch
of
caramel
and
undertones
of
ripe
estery
fruit
that
just
glide
over
the
palate
this
beer
finishes
with
more
malt
and
fruit
up
front
then
ends
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
grassy
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
sweet
and
fruity
flavors
that
linger
pours
deep
amber
with
a
huge
long
lasting
brownish
frothy
head
with
fair
amount
of
lacing
some
smokiness
and
slight
caramel
flavor
upfront
that
giveaway
to
a
dry
finish
nothing
overpowering
or
heavy
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
that
stands
out
smithwicks
which
i
gather
has
just
recently
been
launched
in
the
us
is
an
oddlooking
beer
its
a
diluted
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
head
full
of
random
enormous
bubbles
it
looks
like
sourdough
bread
or
swiss
cheese
smells
malty
with
some
smoked
and
buttery
diacetyl
undertones
tastes
surprisingly
good
smooth
and
malty
with
a
pronounced
smoked
character
that
i
did
not
expect
i
have
no
idea
how
this
compares
to
the
smithwicks
served
elsewhere
but
the
label
design
is
different
and
my
girlfriend
claims
the
version
she
got
in
ireland
was
much
better
overally
this
brew
is
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
not
bad
however
for
3
75
a
pint
id
pass
on
another
to
be
quite
honest
appearance
was
this
beers
strong
suit
poured
a
nice
amber
with
a
frothy
meringuelike
head
that
left
broken
puffs
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
was
rather
vague
sweet
malty
aroma
dried
fruit
perhaps
taste
waspleasant
rather
weak
unsweetened
tealike
taste
very
light
and
slight
hop
dryness
but
a
nice
beer
on
a
warm
day
as
it
is
here
right
now
mouthfeel
is
light
bubblysmooth
drinkability
is
average
not
bad
but
not
that
great
either
good
session
brew
because
of
the
low
abv
you
could
probably
drink
this
till
the
cows
come
home
if
you
are
so
inclined
this
beer
was
hoppier
than
what
i
expected
but
since
im
a
hophead
thats
a
good
thing
i
ordered
this
beer
thinking
i
was
just
getting
something
better
than
the
everyday
macros
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
brought
it
back
home
from
pazzos
in
lexington
plug
for
pazzos
yay
it
is
deep
brown
in
color
with
a
strong
red
tint
it
would
be
a
lot
better
looking
if
the
head
hung
around
for
more
than
0
seconds
but
hey
smells
very
sweet
in
a
fruity
way
and
yeasty
not
too
complex
but
rather
refined
in
its
simplicity
the
taste
is
surprisingly
subtle
and
fades
rather
quicky
as
expected
from
the
nose
there
is
a
sweet
yeasty
taste
the
aforementioned
fruit
being
drowned
out
it
finishes
with
a
dry
grassy
taste
normally
id
prefer
more
carbonation
than
this
but
somehow
this
beer
pulls
it
off
without
much
at
all
a
very
nice
beer
there
is
supposedly
some
story
that
smithwicks
couldnt
be
sold
in
the
us
for
a
number
of
years
due
to
a
noncompete
with
bass
makes
sense
this
is
a
superior
product
to
bass
also
i
am
told
its
pronounced
smitticks
this
was
a
bottled
offering
that
i
had
to
try
i
have
had
draft
and
enjoyed
that
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
full
off
white
head
there
is
malt
in
the
nose
but
no
hop
bitterness
what
is
an
irish
red
ale
anyway
the
flavor
was
malt
driven
although
light
some
bitterness
is
present
no
hops
detected
the
bitterness
does
linger
after
the
malt
goes
away
this
one
finishes
dry
and
bitter
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
an
cream
coloured
head
faint
caramel
in
the
nose
along
with
some
diacetyl
taste
wise
nothing
stands
out
but
nothing
offends
a
very
safe
beer
some
caramel
grain
and
a
little
hops
a
step
above
most
national
brands
crisp
medium
bodied
appearance
is
red
amber
with
lots
of
fluffy
foam
that
produces
sticky
lacing
aroma
has
brown
sugar
and
malt
butter
diacetyl
and
few
hops
initial
taste
contains
notes
of
roasted
barley
sweet
malt
toffee
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
and
reminds
one
of
killians
body
is
thin
and
watery
carbonation
needs
a
booste
finish
is
unsatisfying
leaving
the
tongue
wondering
where
the
flavor
went
smithwicks
ale
is
what
the
horticulturallyinclined
might
call
a
garden
variety
irish
red
ale
it
looks
pretty
good
even
though
a
little
red
would
provide
some
needed
visual
interest
but
it
cant
back
it
up
with
regard
to
the
other
senses
my
sense
is
that
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
and
that
this
one
is
skippable
draft
at
ship
anchor
in
sandy
springs
ga
the
taste
was
fantastic
very
rich
with
a
slight
malt
taste
very
sweet
subdued
after
taste
in
all
a
great
beer
i
am
kind
of
partial
to
this
beer
however
i
would
take
a
smithwicks
anyday
a
much
better
irish
red
than
the
killians
that
i
drank
the
night
before
looks
like
coca
cola
with
nice
ruby
and
orange
highlights
has
great
head
retention
smells
malty
sweet
and
herbal
no
reall
hop
detection
tastes
toasty
sweet
slightly
biscuity
caramelly
and
malty
round
mouthfeel
but
not
heavy
finish
is
malty
and
tacky
to
the
palate
never
detected
much
hop
character
just
enough
to
offset
the
sweetness
i
thought
the
draught
version
of
this
beer
was
a
little
better
than
killians
but
the
bottled
version
not
so
much
dark
amber
with
a
medium
beige
head
the
lacing
is
sticky
and
thin
light
malt
aroma
mediumbodied
with
flavors
of
malt
and
caramel
the
finish
is
hoppy
but
not
very
flavorful
i
can
take
it
or
leave
it
a
pretty
average
example
of
the
style
all
around
did
pour
a
nice
glowing
amber
with
an
impressive
head
aroma
was
muted
with
some
vague
malt
seemed
a
bit
underweight
all
along
i
had
the
impression
that
the
beer
needed
more
malt
substance
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
a
bit
of
tartness
and
some
caramel
but
not
all
that
much
a
snoozer
clear
copper
with
a
great
billowy
cream
colored
head
and
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
pretty
weak
a
little
caramel
biscuit
can
be
detected
along
with
some
mild
hop
taste
isnt
too
bad
a
tad
watery
on
the
palate
though
very
smooth
tastes
like
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
very
light
some
biscuity
malt
and
a
faint
hop
bitterness
i
wanted
something
light
tonight
but
this
goes
a
bit
too
far
in
its
wateriness
certainly
nothing
offensive
about
it
though
this
surprised
me
i
wasnt
expecting
much
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
in
general
but
for
being
an
easy
to
find
massappeal
bottled
beer
its
not
too
bad
i
have
already
purchased
12
bottles
of
this
beer
and
began
to
share
it
with
my
friends
enjoyed
very
much
decent
at
best
taste
massproduced
and
to
light
on
the
palate
many
american
brewers
make
a
better
irish
style
red
ale
overallthis
beer
got
off
to
a
great
start
then
turned
rather
adequete
and
plain
in
the
end
seeing
as
guinness
now
produces
it
it
may
be
the
ingreadiants
have
been
changed
or
perhaps
it
was
always
like
this
regardless
this
is
a
decent
irish
red
that
is
passable
and
true
to
the
style
nothing
more
i
never
new
this
was
available
in
a
bottle
until
today
and
i
must
say
i
liked
it
better
out
of
the
bottle
compared
to
the
taps
ive
had
at
two
places
solid
amber
pour
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
faded
into
a
mill
but
held
and
laced
all
the
way
down
very
malty
and
sweet
on
the
nose
made
my
mouth
water
almost
instantly
good
brutally
smooth
and
crisp
malts
throughandthrough
with
a
hoppy
sting
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
ill
have
to
experiment
and
post
my
results
slightly
too
much
carbonation
in
the
taste
but
a
very
nice
brew
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
refreshing
biscuity
bready
maltiness
in
the
nose
a
very
well
balanced
smooth
taste
with
a
thin
but
crisp
mouthfeel
i
must
admit
that
i
like
this
beer
even
though
i
had
serious
doubts
i
could
chug
several
of
these
down
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
but
nothing
special
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
nice
cascading
effect
ending
in
a
halfinch
creamy
head
nose
is
kind
of
funky
like
a
cheap
american
adjunct
lager
a
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
but
mostly
skunkinessgarbage
the
taste
is
a
little
smoky
up
front
with
a
bit
of
a
phenolic
quality
overall
its
bitter
but
not
from
the
hops
maybe
the
tap
lines
havent
been
cleaned
in
a
while
mouthfeel
is
good
rich
and
creamy
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
it
goes
down
easier
after
a
while
this
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
has
a
good
head
retention
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lace
aroma
is
lacking
with
slight
notes
of
toasted
malt
and
not
much
else
flavor
is
ok
but
fairly
bland
notes
of
caramel
and
a
light
bitterness
over
carbonated
for
the
style
fizzed
up
like
a
soft
drink
while
this
beer
has
a
strong
reputation
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
it
hasnt
suffered
at
the
hands
of
diageo
if
youre
looking
for
an
irish
red
you
could
do
much
better
too
bad
they
have
been
bought
by
guinness
which
has
since
been
bought
by
diageo
i
drink
this
every
now
and
then
and
have
noticed
a
decrement
in
quality
makes
do
but
nothing
much
more
than
that
drinkability
very
im
not
crazy
about
red
ales
but
this
is
one
that
i
have
a
hard
time
passing
up
lots
of
carbonation
in
this
one
overall
a
good
drink
that
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
if
you
like
irish
red
you
would
be
better
off
going
for
a
beamish
red
or
a
porterhouse
red
if
you
happen
to

overall
this
is
an

beer
which
i
occasionally
end
up
having
one
too
many
bad
pickup
lines
to
follow
i
like
red
ales
in
general
so
maybe
that
made
me
like
this
beer
more
than
dislike
it
however
when
it
came
out
of
the
tap
it
had
almost
no
head
at
all
and
that
was
unimpressive
the
taste
was
bitter
and
fruity
with
a
pretty
smooth
feel
its
definitely
drinkable
because
of
the
pretty
good
taste
but
after
a
while
i
could
see
myself
getting
tired
of
it
id
rank
this
beer
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
the
best
part
about
this
beer
by
leaps
and
bounds
is
its
beautiful
deep
dark
amber
color
gorgeous
in
the
glass
with
a
short
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
up
and
down
the
sides
smells
lightly
of
alcohol
and
grain
not
altogether
offensive
but
the
horror
almost
reminds
me
of
certain
american
pale
lagers
tastes
first
of
caramel
then
of
grain
and
finally
thin
fizzy
bitterness
for
all
its
color
finishes
bone
dry
with
a
tragically
meager
mouthfeel
not
an
offensive
beer
often
the
best
thing
available
at
irish
pubs
that
only
serve
macros
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
where
better
beers
are
available
drinkability
it
is
good
one
but
nothing
for
selling
my
soul
to
the
devil
for
sure
its
a
goodlooking
brew
a
dark
burntamber
colored
liquid
very
clear
with
a
beautiful
frothy
white
head
not
much
aroma
at
alla
little
grain
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
all
very
faint
almost
no
hops
in
the
aroma
at
all
the
body
was
notably
thin
which
seemed
notable
even
before
the
taste
a
bit
of
malt
but
very
understated
very
quiet
finish
this
beer
really
didnt
do
anything
for
me
taste
is
dominated
b
a
bready
crisp
maltiness
with
some
underlying
hops
to
offset
the
sweetness
thats
about
it
for
the
flavor
very
straightforward
beer
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
and
a
bt
thin
in
the
mouth
easy
drinker
but
somehow
doesnt
put
it
all
together
to
be
anything
distinctive
one
of
the
best
irish
reds
ive
had
though
i
do
recall
having
a
bottle
of
one
some
time
ago
and
it
not
being
half
as
good
which
is
probably
a
result
of
it
not
being
a
hot
seller
around
me
i
recommend
checking
for
freshness
before
purchasing
bottles
sweet
caramel
malts
up
front
buttery
cream
in
the
middle
of
the
sip
and
then
a
watery
seltzer
finish
what
happened
this
beer
started
out
okay
but
finishes
on
a
weak
note
too
bland
for
a
true
irish
red
this
is
not
something
i
see
myself
drinking
again
i
must
say
i
was
disappointed
it
what
was
my
first
true
irish
red
the
color
of
this
brew
is
almost
beyond
desciption
a
fantastic
clear
ruddyorange
that
had
a
metallic
copperesque
quality
nice
1
cream
colored
head
of
tight
foam
with
very
clingy
slow
lace
the
nose
was
very
shy
offering
a
hint
that
there
is
body
to
the
beer
its
even
too
even
and
mildly
sweet
some
malt
like
the
nose
its
shy
throat
was
clean
with
some
subtle
citrus
but
otherwise
an
uneventful
brew
that
didnt
hold
its
true
colors
too
bad
because
it
was
beautiful
to
look
at
i
guess
personality
does
count
lol
disappointingly
blah
at
best
i
doubt
i
will
purchase
again
unless
for
st
patricks
day
events
the
draft
pour
was
wonderful
dark
mahogany
brown
with
an
excellent
brown
head
that
laced
all
the
way
down
just
a
lite
malt
grainy
aroma
and
taste
but
not
too
heavy
for
a
spring
day
before
the
baseball
game
great
body
with
this
one
perfectly
carbed
only
had
two
but
it
left
me
wanting
more
i
will
look
for
this
one
at
irish
bars
this
is
sooo
much
better
than
harp
smittiks
is
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
more
than
a
few
of
and
still
enjoy
there
are
no
funny
flavors
and
it
is
very
well
balanced
not
too
hoppy
and
not
too
sweet
i
will
definitely
pick
up
a
couple
of
sixers
to
keep
around
for
a
cool
refresher
during
the
hazy
hot
and
humid
jersey
summers
is
it
me
or
is
harp
becoming
hard
to
find
very
pleasant
to
drink
brew
complex
enough
to
keep
your
attention
but
never
harsh
an
excellent
choice
for
a
session
beer
pours
out
to
a
dark
amber
brown
colour
with
a
long
lived
dense
white
foamy
head
no
real
odor
to
speak
of
kind
of
a
stale
smell
with
a
touch
of
maltiness
detected
the
flavor
left
quite
a
bit
to
be
desired
as
it
comes
off
as
plain
bland
and
generally
mediocre
id
prefer
a
cheaper
irish
red
any
day
but
this
may
be
up
your
alley
as
its
very
smooth
and
goes
down
well
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
smooth
very
slight
dry
aftertaste
drinkability
is
slightly
better
than
average
mostly
because
it
is
unoffensive
and
sports
a
simple
taste
had
this
on
tap
at
the
local
pub
pours
an
amberred
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
wasnt
very
nice
hard
to
describe
but
i
didnt
like
it
much
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
caramel
character
and
some
slight
sweetness
but
i
just
didnt
care
much
for
the
flavor
of
this
one
its
not
bad
but
its
not
great
either
from
notes
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
brown
deep
amber
color
wtih
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
slowly
ther
ewas
a
slight
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
but
also
a
sweetness
that
didnt
sit
well
with
me
i
think
it
was
from
corn
there
was
a
touch
of
hops
but
nothing
really
grabbed
me
and
said
it
smelled
nice
the
flavor
was
slightly
spicey
in
the
hop
and
slightly
caramel
on
the
malt
but
overall
i
was
not
all
that
impressed
with
it
the
feel
was
light
and
watery
with
a
light
carb
all
around
lacking
the
beer
was
easy
drinking
and
smooth
but
taking
all
the
other
qualities
into
account
i
was
not
all
that
impressed
slàinte
this
beers
taste
is
by
far
its
best
quality
other
than
the
nice
red
kick
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
characteristics
that
really
stand
out
finally
decided
to
try
this
when
i
found
a
single
the
beer
appears
dark
amber
with
a
sudsy
white
head
and
large
bubbles
the
aroma
is
plain
i
would
probably
think
it
was
a
german
lager
blindfolded
the
flavor
is
fairly
clean
with
a
little
graininess
mildly
malty
with
possibly
a
faint
roasted
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
highly
carbonated
and
a
little
astringent
overall
its
an
ok
irish
red
that
sure
beats
the
artificial
irish
red
that
is
made
by
you
know
who
still
not
too
intersting
in
my
opinion
on
tap
poured
into
a
smithwicks
tulip
pint
glass
it
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
just
a
touch
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
light
theres
some
caramel
maltiness
but
not
much
else
going
on
the
taste
is
very
very
sweet
lots
of
pale
maltiness
with
caramel
flavors
and
just
the
slightest
bit
of
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
the
drinkability
is
fairly
nice
just
your
average
irish
red
ale
this
here
is
an
excellent
session
ale
and
it
goes
great
with
irish
food
this
one
pours
out
to
a
very
dark
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
goodsized
head
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
bread
dough
the
taste
is
good
with
a
nice
maltiness
giving
way
to
a
light
sweetness
more
flavor
than
typical
amber
offerings
in
this
class
this
one
screams
session
as
i
could
see
having
several
of
these
at
a
time
the
beer
decamps
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
a
pellucid
brown
with
a
substantial
frothy
light
tan
head
that
after
its
decomposion
leaves
thick
layer
of
lace
to
surround
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
and
a
touch
earthy
nice
caramel
tone
also
noticed
fresh
and
crisp
a
nice
lightly
sweet
start
that
is
nicely
malted
and
the
top
light
and
gentle
on
the
palate
finish
is
modest
in
its
acidity
with
the
hops
delicate
and
the
aftertaste
dry
nice
to
see
it
here
in
bottles
although
fresh
from
the
tap
is
my
choice
for
sampling
this
nice
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
a
tad
creamy
with
healthy
carbonation
fills
the
mouth
well
drinkability
is
good
as
it
goes
down
easy
however
this
is
not
something
id
regularly
go
far
sampled
at
local
beer
distributer
at
thursday
night
tastings
poured
an
attractive
copper
color
with
enormous
longlasting
head
smell
was
nonexistent
taste
was
so
smooth
i
felt
i
wasnt
even
drinking
a
beer
probably
would
appeal
to
a
coors
light
fan
the
appearance
is
exceptional
certainly
a
nice
mellow
brown
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
good
long
time
but
other
than
that
i
was
amazed
at
how
bad
this
beer
managed
to
be
better
than
macroswill
but
only
very
slightly
so
id
rather
go
with
just
about
any
leines
or
michelob
brew
for
less
money
or
spring
for
a
real
irish
like
beamish
or
guiness
extra
stout
never
been
a
fan
of
the
draught
pours
a
nice
reddishbrown
color
with
a
very
slight
white
head
subtle
malty
odor
the
flavor
is
also
quite
malty
with
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
providing
some
bitterness
the
flavors
in
this
beer
seem
to
blend
together
nicely
nothing
is
too
overpowering
incredibly
drinkable
smithwicks
goes
down
very
easily
and
has
become
my
new
favorite
session
beer
in
the
multitude
of
irish
pubs
around
here
that
are
usually
topheavy
with
macros
writing
this
review
has
my
mouth
watering
for
beer
work
needs
to
end
soon
i
did
not
realize
this
was
considered
a
red
ale
until
looking
on
this
website
looked
much
darker
in
a
smoky
bar
last
night
and
felt
heavier
on
the
stomach
reminded
me
a
porter
therefor
this
loses
some
points
in
comparsion
to
other
reds
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
malts
and
drinkable
enoght
o
enjoy
two
in
a
row
i
wanted
so
much
to
like
this
i
found
it
unremarkable
in
the
extreme
for
an
ale
this
is
actually
a
decent
light
lager
see
also
lawson
creek
red
ale
not
a
bad
session
style
beer
more
along
the
lines
of
a
mild
subtle
in
every
aspect
nothing
i
would
seek
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
overall
impression
all
in
all
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
nothing
too
outstanding
but
a
decent
choice
if
you
want
an
easy
drinker
the
beer
completed
the
fish
and
chips
nicelyhas
more
body
than
the
harp
lager
also
on
tap
at
the
pub
but
is
less
filling
than
guinness
stout
which
has
of
course
a
nice
taste
but
is
rich
and
heavy
especially
eating
fried
food
along
with
it
during
happy
hour
the
special
was
buy
one
get
one
on
draught
pints
so
i
had
two
and
the
drinkability
was
good
with
the
smoothness
shing
through
the
most
drinkability
not
bad
enough
character
to
make
it
interesting
and
slightly
unique
but
not
too
heavy
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
huge
letdown
versus
the
draft
sample
i
will
agree
that
the
relatively
high
carbonation
hurts
drinkability
hopefully
pub
managers
on
these
shores
will
learn
to
dial
down
c02
pressure
and
ease
up
on
the
chilling
to
give
this
baby
the
presentation
it
deserves
alright
today
is
20
feb
and
i
have
had
another
one
of
these
things
this
really
is
terrible
i
think
i
was
extemely
generous
in
giving
this
stuff
a
3
something
or
other
for
an
overall
rating
if
sprite
made
a
beer
this
would
be
it
way
too
carbonated
given
to
me
by
mark
at
3
corners
pours
a
dark
amber
color
and
has
a
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
a
touch
of
hops
is
in
there
too
the
flavor
is
a
bitter
hop
bite
up
front
and
a
nice
smooth
ale
character
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
hoppy
dry
finish
more
proof
that
our
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
can
brew
some
groovy
beer
i
could
definitely
drink
this
all
night
and
not
get
bored
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
slightly
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
bit
of
crystal
malts
along
with
some
hops
to
boot
the
taste
is
decent
also
again
it
is
slightly
malty
with
a
dry
finish
but
the
hops
stand
out
a
bit
more
as
its
quite
bitter
it
goes
down
easy
but
seems
a
tad
watery
fro
my
tastes
i
guess
thats
the
irish
style
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
brew
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
irish
ale
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
malt
character
but
it
fits
the
style
just
fine
a
good
drinker
darker
red
in
color
small
offwhite
head
smell
is
maltcentric
slightly
roasted
hops
are
not
a
big
part
of
this
beer
in
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
taste
is
full
and
sweet
but
has
some
depth
to
it
provided
by
the
nice
malt
and
slight
hop
presence
fairly
good
beer
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
there
are
tons
of
better
reds
out
there
smithwicks
is
a
very
dark
redamber
color
with
a
pure
white
head
i
was
impressed
as
to
how
balanced
this
beer
was
between
maltiness
and
hoppiness
the
malty
flavor
wins
out
here
slightly
a
very
warming
beer
caramellike
malts
make
it
very
satisfying
didnt
expect
to
be
blown
away
by
this
especially
after
reading
some
other
reviews
and
overall
i
wasnt
however
this
is
great
for
what
it
is
a
light
flavorful
beer
that
doesnt
demand
too
much
of
the
taster
somewhat
lower
in
abv
and
wonderful
for
a
session
beer
this
practically
has
session
ale
written
all
over
it
i
suppose
those
looking
for
an
irish
beer
that
isnt
a
stout
will
enjoy
this
nothing
groundbreaking
but
still
rather
enjoyable
garnet
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
which
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
nice
malt
and
mineral
aroma
coming
off
this
beer
with
very
little
hops
the
flavor
is
malt
dominated
ranging
from
sweet
to
toffee
and
then
roasted
with
a
bitter
finish
to
balance
nice
carbonation
and
body
this
is
perhaps
the
best
of
the
three
irish
reds
ive
had
with
more
body
and
richer
malt
character
than
murphys
or
killeans
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
id
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
its
much
better
than
many
of
the
standards
you
find
on
tap
ill
drink
it
again
moderate
of
both
body
and
carbonation
this
is
a
session
beer
all
the
way
not
a
bad
choice
not
bad
but
id
find
other
first
taste
was
well
balanced
with
a
sweet
malt
backbone
and
a
kiss
of
herbal
hops
bitterness
crisp
and
refreshing
with
biscuity
malt
and
a
lot
less
hopping
than
the
american
red
ales
ive
grown
accustomed
to
very
enjoyable
particularly
with
the
delis
signature
dish
of
grilled
shrimp
and
asparagus
salad
outstanding
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottle
perfect
appearance
with
a
long
lasting
head
and
clear
dark
amber
color
bubbling
carbonation
and
spotty
lacing
very
refreshing
crisp
mouthfeel
and
wellbalanced
with
just
the
right
bitterness
and
malt
flavors
perfect
when
are
not
in
the
mood
for
guinnessharpor
bass
highly
drinkable
again
refreshing
aroma
could
be
more
distinctive
this
could
easily
become
a
staple
beer
for
me
medium
bodied
with
a
sweet
malt
finish
hearing
this
selection
was
an
irish
red
i
was
surprised
when
a
tall
dark
pint
appeared
at
my
table
almost
as
dark
as
a
guinness
but
with
significantly
larger
bubbles
of
carbonation
the
aroma
was
somewhat
mild
but
a
toasty
note
came
through
as
for
the
taste
it
again
was
somewhat
mild
nice
flavors
of
coffee
toasted
nuts
and
caramel
with
just
a
touch
of
a
bitter
burnt
chocolate
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
few
pints
will
go
down
quite
easy
that
being
said
its
also
isnt
one
to
get
overly
excited
about
nice
but
not
memorable
had
this
one
on
tap
at
some
irish
pub
in
sf
nice
creamy
head
with
an
amber
body
to
it
the
taste
was
creamy
as
well
had
hints
of
malts
and
light
fruits
the
taste
was
almost
like
a
beer
with
cream
in
it
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
as
a
result
of
the
taste
it
also
coated
the
mouth
fairly
well
and
held
a
nice
aftertaste
it
was
very
refreshing
and
made
it
easy
to
pound
a
few
down
in
no
time
give
it
shot
if
you
like
wexford
or
belhavens
best
so
glad
i
took
the
salesmans
advice
on
trying
out
this
wonderful
brew
drinkability
is
a
average
with
this
overall
average
beer
i
gotta
say
this
wasnt
all
that
bad
a
nice
example
of
a
session
brew
wouldnt
mind
having
this
in
my
rotation
once
in
a
while
i
will
update
next
time
i
get
it
either
bottled
or
on
tap
appearance
light

almost
white

as
well

and

overall
taste
flowery

light

very

finishes
slightly
earthy
for
me
mouthfeel

in
body
evenly
carbonated
cant
complain
too
much
drinkability
very
sessionable
not
too
watery
but
not
flavorful
enough
for
me
i
enjoyed
it
in
canada
when
throwing
darts
and
drinking
in
bars
with
little
or
no
beer
selections
glad
to
see
it
made
its
way
back
to
the
states
all
in
all
not
bad
but
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
might
make
a
good
black
and
tan
though
drinkability
excellent
drinkability
perfect
for
a
quiet
night
out
of
rest
and
relaxation
its
smoothness
ensures
it
goes
down
very
well
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
drink
to
be
taken
with
a
meal
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
quite
a
filling
ale
nonetheless
as
an
irish
man
i
cant
help
but
feeling
proud
of
this
crowning
ale
well
i
have
been
enjoying
smithwicks
for
the
past
few
months
and
guess
i
have
forgotten
to
review
it
it
has
really
taken
off
in
the
albany
ny
area
can
find
it
on
tap
at
a
lot
of
restaurants
and
is
available
for
growler
fills
at
both
glenmont
and
olivers
beverage
centers
with
this
said
i
got
a
growler
the
other
day
and
must
say
that
this
is
a
nice
brew
it
pours
to
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
a
fantastic
light
tan
head
that
has
fair
retention
and
good
lacing
that
sticks
nicely
for
about
half
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
a
nice
balanced
brew
stronger
on
the
malt
side
with
highlights
of
caramel
that
seems
to
go
along
with
the
sweet
smell
the
taste
of
this
brew
goes
along
with
the
aroma
solid
flavor
and
the
sweetness
that
i
sensed
in
the
aroma
goes
well
definitely
not
over
powering
this
is
a
great
session
brew
one
that
i
could
enjoy
for
an
entire
evening
also
see
that
this
brew
has
been
able
to
bridge
the
gap
for
some
friends
that
are
usually
macro
drinkers
again
a
cleas
mouth
feel
and
easy
going
down
good
for
more
then
one
this
is
a
pretty
typical
englishirish
ale
its
got
a
similar
flavor
to
the
stuff
like
boddingtons
and
bass
but
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
flavor
very
slight
hops
a
bit
of
estery
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
malt
its
easy
drinking
but
also
very
forgettable
priced
at
the
premium
import
range
this
would
be
a
tough
beer
to
turn
to
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all
i
would
probably
have
more
of
in
were
i
drinking
it
somewhere
localy
a
nice
ir
ale
does
well
and
its
like
guinness
to
produce
something
as
easy
drinking
as
this
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
tried
but
a
fine
brew
nonetheless
it
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
and
i
owe
it
thanks
for
setting
me
on
the
path
to
beer
righteousness
drinkability
easily
enjoyed
and
one
of
the
best
session
ales
ive
ever
had
its
great
to
have
it
widely
available
on
draft
in
the
states
if
only
its
price
were
on
par
with
us
macros
i
think
this
could
develop
a
real
following
had
not
seen
much
of
this
in
the
usa
before
i
glanced
at
the
taps
after
i
entered
kells
irish
pub
in
portland
so
while
me
and
the
wife
waited
for
a
tabel
i
ordered
one
very
attaractive
clear
brown
beer
with
a
lovelly
off
white
frothy
head
nice
aromas
of
slighly
roasty
malts
not
a
bad
tasting
irish
ale
at
all
smooth
and
malty
with
a
small
hint
of
hops
maybe
a
littel
toffeeish
taste
too
its
sort
of
average
on
the
palte
maybe
on
the
lager
side
of
thin
overall
a
nice
session
ale
for
watching
footie
on
the
big
tvs
clear
nutbrown
red
colour
topped
by
a
thin
lace
of
light
tancreamcoloured
head
the
aroma
was
nutty
and
had
a
definite
caramel
quality
but
little
to
no
hop
presence
nuttiness
carried
into
the
flavour
and
light
fruity
esters
were
present
malt
sweetness
was
nicely
balanced
by
hop
bitterness
but
there
still
wasnt
a
lot
of
flavour
character
from
the
hops
the
finish
was
clean
and
slightly
bitter
medium
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
that
was
more
evident
towards
the
finish
taste
very
smooth
with
a
small
drizzle
of
hops
and
larger
helping
of
malt
feels
slick
caramelly
easy
to
toss
back
just
enough
flavor
but
not
really
enough
to
make
it
more
than
a
session
ale
something
to
pass
the
time
without
worrying
the
mind
whos
up
for
darts
a
nice
ale
to
have
as
a
session
beer
or
when
hanging
around
the
pub
with
some
friends
brownish
red
ale
nutty
caramel
nose
the
taste
is
caramelic
and
hoppy
excellent
balance
between
malt
and
hops
actually
great
nutty
bitterness
very
well
done
simple
and
light
ale
surprisingly
decent
as
im
not
a
fan
of
any
irish
beers
that
i
know
of
this
was
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
it
was
quite
popular
in
ireland
when
i
was
there
but
i
chose
to
only
drink
guinness
and
baileys
for
the
entire
trip
good
to
see
it
make
its
way
to
the
states
this
beer
pours
an
attractive
brown
amber
with
a
nice
head
the
smell
is
on
the
dull
side
the
beer
has
a
deep
caramel
malt
taste
followed
by
a
quick
hit
of
bitterness
it
is
a
pleasant
although
not
overwhelming
taste
it
is
has
a
medium
body
and
i
would
say
that
overall
it
is
quite
palateable
and
drinkable
this
reddishbrown
ale
poured
a
decent
sustained
head
smell
was
a
wee
bit
smokey
taste
was
of
caramel
malts
blended
into
a
muted
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
decent
and
lively
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
very
enjoyable
i
think
i
have
found
a
new
irish
session
beer
i
think
it
is
better
than
harp
and
killians
not
real
exciting
in
any
particular
category
but
pretty
solid
in
balance
and
appearance
im
planning
to
go
to
portland
me
on
business
this
week
and
will
seek
this
one
out
on
draught
at
brian
borus
or
rirasi
wonder
how
it
tastes
also
it
will
probably
appeal
to
my
business
colleagues
who
before
traveling
with
me
were
pretty
much
wedded
to
bud
and
heineken
yuk
ill
purchase
this
one
again
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
copperbrown
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
aroma
is
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
smoke
not
a
very
assertive
nose
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
heavy
malts
press
against
a
nice
smokiness
that
becomes
more
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
is
to
be
found
as
well
it
possess
a
medium
body
and
i
definately
would
nominate
this
as
a
decent
session
brew
plus
its
sweet
enough
to
offer
to
your
friends
who
cant
stand
hop
bombs
although
it
wont
be
in
my
regular
purchasing
rotation
pours
a
brown
amber
with
a
nice
head
lacing
is
average
at
best
the
smell
is
very
nutty
and
of
brown
sugar
slight
hints
of
molasses
as
well
the
tate
a
little
to
scotch
for
my
tasting
very
sweet
of
brown
sugar
and
molasses
and
no
hop
balance
to
blend
with
the
sweetness
medium
bodied
and
wouldnt
recommend
to
anyone
i
would
call
this
a
fairly
boring
beer
move
along
and
try
something
else
pours
a
copper
bronze
color
with
lots
of
big
bubbles
and
a
long
lasting
creamy
head
theres
plenty
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
a
yeast
fruityness
pleasant
diacytel
buttery
caramel
and
aroma
hops
the
taste
is
well
balanced
with
a
big
dose
of
caramel
malts
a
distinct
fruityness
and
herbal
hops
bittering
hops
are
sparse
the
mouthfeel
is
grainy
the
finish
isnt
bogged
down
by
the
sweet
malt
flavors
very
clean
overall
this
is
a
very
good
ale
and
its
available
on
tap
in
a
lot
of
places
too
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
heard
that
this
is
owned
by
guinness
which
must
be
why
it
seems
to
be
popping
up
just
about
everywhere
being
owned
by
them
doesnt
seem
to
have
impacted
the
quality
much
we
dropped
by
the
office
in
morristown
nj
tonight
and
found
this
on
tap
the
ale
came
out
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
a
matching
head
it
also
was
translucent
a
very
nice
looking
beer
that
added
to
the
anticipation
the
smell
was
light
with
just
a
little
bit
of
malt
and
alcohol
in
it
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
taste
a
very
mellow
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
hoppy
finish
it
is
medium
with
some
carbonation
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
pleasant
experience
and
will
have
to
make
my
way
back
to
the
office
to
do
a
little
more
research
on
this
one
my
disclaimer
this
beer
is
popular
and
in
reading
reviews
other
bas
really
enjoy
it
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
maybe
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
maybe
ive
been
drinking
too
many
bock
style
beers
stuff
from
belgium
and
big
ipas
who
knows
maybe
it
wasnt
so
good
because
i
wasnt
in
ireland
while
drinking
it
this
time
around
regardless
i
just
wasnt
impressed
pours
a
garnet
red
with
some
brown
highlights
and
a
thick
beige
head
that
stays
fluffy
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
pint
really
kind
of
hard
to
pick
on
any
aroma
other
than
some
weak
earthy
malt
and
a
dulled
fruitiness
maybe
a
dash
of
cocoa
weak
lightly
toasted
malt
taste
that
is
pretty
enjoyable
dulled
chocolate
malt
notes
as
it
warms
watery
mouthfeel
probably
around
the
same
strength
of
belhaven
or
boddingtons
easily
drinkable
due
to
low
abv
this
beer
has
some
character
but
lacks
some
at
the
same
time
a
touch
acidic
in
its
malt
profile
and
a
bit
minerally
in
its
water
content
i
had
this
ontap
at
the
black
rose
an
irish
pub
in
downtown
grand
rapids
i
believe
this
is
the
only
place
in
grand
rapids
where
i
could
get
this
beer
so
i
had
to
try
it
out
the
beer
had
a
really
dark
amber
color
to
it
that
turned
copper
when
held
to
light
small
but
steady
tan
head
accompanied
the
beer
the
smell
seemed
a
bit
weak
and
watery
but
i
was
surrounded
by
food
the
taste
was
not
watery
at
all
though
this
beer
was
much
thicker
in
body
and
flavor
than
i
had
expected
there
was
a
caramel
maltiness
upfront
but
it
wasnt
really
sweet
underneath
that
was
a
toasted
grain
flavor
combined
with
a
maple
syrup
taste
little
earthy
hop
pricks
kept
hitting
my
tongue
but
a
full
hoppiness
was
never
relized
i
believe
this
beer
is
only
3
9
abv
and
considered
a
session
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
too
many
of
these
but
it
was
still
a
solid
beer
a
lot
of
carbonation
a
bit
of
malty
taste
did
not
go
flat
after
an
hour
robust
some
hops
and
a
bitter
bite
aftertaste
quench
your
thirst
then
after
that
you
could
do
worse
its
an
easy
summer
drink
carmel
and
midsip
fruity
taste
and
carmel
colour
session
beer
this
is
one
of
my
dads
favorites
he
had
it
while
on
a
trip
to
ireland
and
has
been
raving
about
it
ever
sense
he
will
be
glad
to
know
its
now
available
on
this
side
of
the
pond
malt
predominantes
in
the
taste
with
a
slight
backbite
of
hops
underneath
a
silky
mouthfeel
and
clean
finish
nothing
terribly
spectacular
here
just
a
decent
brew
i
switched
over
to
guinness
without
trying
another
not
bad
it
may
be
my
irish
beer
of
choice
next
time
i
return
there
first
sip
reveals
an
average
bodied
beer
with
fine
rolling
carbonation
flavor
is
not
robust
but
is
tasty
some
sweet
malt
flavors
mix
with
the
earthy
hops
that
were
present
on
the
nose
as
the
beer
warms
the
hops
are
more
flavorful
and
dominant
quite
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
rolls
to
my
belly
very
smoothly
clear
darker
amber
appearance
with
a
pale
creamy
head
of
excellent
duration
fat
dripping
rings
for
laces
slight
grain
to
the
aroma
but
not
too
much
else
to
read
in
that
department
body
is
fine
the
carbonation
is
done
right
just
enough
to
call
it
quaffable
and
creamy
the
flavor
just
leaves
me
wanting
something
more
to
hang
a
hat
on
very
obvious
pale
caramel
and
powdery
sugar
to
begin
with
then
a
fade
to
black
without
much
of
any
hop
sense
theres
nothing
obviously
wrong
here
but
the
bottom
falls
out
after
the
attractive
looking
pour
pint
glass
presentation
nice
light
tan
head
on
dark
amber
brew
and
laced
excellently
aroma
and
taste
similar
to
that
of
guinnes
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
describe
with
words
but
less
intense
this
is
not
so
much
a
bad
thing
mouthfeel
very
good
and
drinkability
is
excellent
could
and
would
be
interested
in
drinking
this
more
than
once
overall
a
very
good
beer
to
have
on
tap
alongside
bud
miller
coors
we
had
a
great
night
at
derrys
pub
near
miller
park
stadium
in
milwaukee
our
group
found
this
a
good
session
beer
for
a
mixed
bunch
of
adventurous
and
less
adventurous
drinkers
while
i
like
the
beer
i
could
not
help
think
that
guinness
is
basically
just
filling
in
their
line
from
a
marketing
perspective
guinness
smithwicks
bass
harp
deep
amber
color
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
beige
head
and
lace
roast
malt
and
sweetness
are
the
major
tastes
upfront
the
brew
then
smooths
in
the
mouth
sweet
malt
smell
a
hint
of
grass
taste
in
the
malty
hazelnut
finish
smooth
medium
mouth
a
solid
session
kind
of
beer
on
tap
i
was
pleased
to
see
this
at
a
macro
pub
close
to
my
work
something
worth
trying
poured
dark
amber
with
a
creamy
white
head
nice
maltyearthy
nose
creamy
mouthfeel
malt
nutty
and
a
bit
of
peat
in
flavor
profile
this
was
a
pleasant
suprise
a
dencent
irish
ale
good
session
brew
now
available
in
many
bars
in
the
new
york
metro
area
i
have
had
occasion
to
sample
this
ale
a
few
times
this
past
week
wonderful
taste
completely
absent
of
any
bitter
aftertaste
there
is
a
mild
sweetness
cant
describe
the
flavors
great
dark
color
and
a
decent
head
very
easy
to
drink
with
mild
effects
the
next
morning
my
absolute
favorite
beer
nice
to
find
smithys
here
in
greensboro
at
mccouls
public
housepours
a
deep
copper
with
some
amber
highlights
with
a
pretty
thin
head
aroma
is
roasted
and
very
fruity
with
some
big
caramel
notesi
also
got
a
some
doughy
flavors
in
the
background
much
more
fruity
than
expectedi
really
liked
this
beer
will
become
my
staple
when
i
go
to
that
bar
bottle
poured
a
brownish
looking
beer
with
a
nice
bubbly
head
with
standard
retention
some
notes
of
creamy
and
caramely
taste
overall
this
is
a
very
decent
session
irish
ale
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
or
too
complex
aroma
is
a
mix
of
hops
and
sweetness
taste
is
quite
bitter
with
a
dry
finish
and
also
has
when
i
was
in
ireland
i
consistently
heard
this
was
an
old
mans
beer
with
guinness
and
kilkenny
supposedly
being
the
standard
and
youngercrowd
beers
repsectively
i
sampled
it
quite
a
few
times
over
there
just
because
you
couldnt
get
it
here
at
the
time
and
i
must
say
that
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
albiet
nondaring
brew
now
thats
it
is
being
imported
i
figured
id
give
it
another
go
it
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
colour
with
a
fluffy
head
that
just
looks
rich
and
creamy
the
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
much
the
same
a
bit
sweet
a
bit
buttery
a
bit
creamy
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
its
quite
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
has
a
good
amount
of
flavour
while
remaining
pretty
much
as
basic
as
you
can
get
this
is
a
great
session
brew
if
youre
looking
for
something
simple
it
was
poured
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
quickly
dissipated
it
was
a
dark
amber
in
color
that
was
several
shades
darker
towards
the
center
of
the
glass
kind
of
neat
it
had
a
nice
wood
finish
to
the
taste
it
is
a
very
wellrounded
beer
and
allows
for
the
drinker
to
taste
the
hops
and
a
dark
malty
aftertaste
to
be
honest
i
didnt
go
in
thinking
much
of
this
since
it
was
a
product
from
the
guinnessbassharp
people
but
it
honestly
wasnt
that
bad
at
all
a
nice
bitterness
on
top
of
the
malt
kept
them
both
fairly
balanced
for
good
drinkability
and
this
beer
is
certainly
something
that
i
could
drink
as
a
session
brew
had
a
pint
of
this
at
the
local
irish
pub
they
were
advertising
it
heavily
so
i
stopped
in
to
try
it
on
tap
it
pours
a
very
nice
amber
with
a
goodsized
tannish
head
with
decent
amounts
of
lacing
there
was
little
aroma
to
ale
but
the
atmosphere
was
very
smoky
which
made
it
hard
to
smell
the
beer
the
taste
was
average
with
a
nice
malty
taste
little
carbonation
and
no
bitterness
it
had
a
decent
feel
in
the
mouth
but
overall
this
is
not
a
favorite
i
actually
think
that
i
like
killians
better
and
thats
not
even
irish
smithwicks
was
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
trace
of
copper
the
head
was
insubstantial
and
there
was
no
lace
the
aroma
was
meek
a
little
caramelly
with
a
slight
floral
bouquet
as
for
taste
there
was
not
much
happening
it
was
mellow
and
dry
with
slight
touches
of
caramel
coffee
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
little
hop
bite
the
finish
was
dryish
and
chalky
overall
i
was
disappointed
to
me
it
was
a
bland
beer
this
beer
is
a
rich
brown
yellow
not
much
in
the
way
of
red
color
dense
creamy
foam
smells
nice
and
sweet
with
something
else
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
very
subtle
taste
is
malty
with
no
burnt
or
roasted
notes
maybe
a
little
chocolate
tiny
bit
of
hop
bitterness
tastes
pretty
darn
good
low
carbonation
does
not
taste
water
thin
but
its
light
and
goes
down
very
easy
great
session
ale
the
hops
possess
a
tealike
quality
and
just
a
hint
of
lemony
citrus
it
begins
and
finishes
dry
had
a
great
frothy
offwhite
head
and
some
decent
lacing
ruddy
amber
in
appearance
hoppy
nose
with
a
base
of
sweetish
malt
the
malt
in
the
flavour
seemed
a
bit
more
grainy
than
on
the
aroma
balanced
by
a
bitter
hop
finish
yet
had
an
astringent
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
full
everything
seemed
to
be
in
its
place
but
this
really
didnt
do
anything
for
me
actually
seemed
pretty
unremarkable
for
an
amber
now
i
remember
why
i
hadnt
tried
this
again
after
so
many
years
ive
seen
this
at
a
couple
of
places
where
it
seems
suspiciously
heavily
promoted
i
tried
it
on
tap
at
oconnors
where
it
was
served
so
cold
my
fingers
ached
on
holding
the
glass
it
had
a
pleasant
amber
color
but
hardly
any
head
and
only
a
faint
scent
of
hops
it
was
too
fizzy
and
cold
for
me
i
could
barely
taste
much
but
faintly
sour
hops
only
the
prospect
of
having
something
else
got
me
to
finish
this
draught
in
ireland
this
one
is
a
crystal
clear
amber
color
a
bit
of
a
tight
white
head
somewhat
sweet
and
malty
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
what
a
real
irish
red
tastes
like
im
not
sure
if
it
tastes
differently
anywhere
else
as
i
have
only
had
it
in
ireland
im
interested
if
it
is
any
different
in
the
states
i
used
to
drink
this
when
there
was
nothing
else
in
bars
but
now
i
avoid
it
a
solid
easy
drinking
session
pint
my
guess
is
an
irish
red
ale
whatever
it
is
i
was
glad
to
have
enjoyed
a
pint
on
a
sunday
evening
in
an
irish
style
pub
satisfying
and
delicious
passing
good
but
not
one
id
go
looking
for
drinkability
glides
down
pint
after
pint
after
pint
reddish
copper
color
with
a
big
light
tan
head
strange
aroma
that
i
can
not
quite
place
not
very
interesting
maybe
malt
maybe
hops
hmm
not
sure
light
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
roast
in
the
finish
but
then
disappears
not
much
happening
here
its
finish
is
ever
so
slightly
bitter
and
somewhat
soapy
not
really
recommended
no
head
to
speak
of
with
a
nice
deep
amber
color
very
smooth
to
drink
with
a
clean
aftertaste
slight
malt
with
a
distinct
carmalized
hop
finish
not
an
extreme
hop
style
but
very
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
brew
i
really
liked
this
brew
slainte
notes
of
caramel
and
not
too
much
hops
this
is
a
very
good
irish
red
ale
and
was
so
tasty
it
even
took
me
away
from
guinnes
while
i
was
there
a
fine
looking
dark
tawney
amber
that
has
a
very
nice
large
offwhite
head
with
great
lacing
the
nose
is
light
and
provides
subtle
hints
of
understated
caramel
malt
the
flavor
is
a
musky
light
affair
with
very
subtle
hops
in
the
background
the
feel
is
a
soft
creamy
and
uncrisp
bit
of
wispyness
good
drinkability
once
youre
used
to
the
style
other
i
suspect
well
be
seeing
more
of
this
in
irish
pubs
in
the
usa
and
canada
soon
after
buying
this
in
ireland
and
carrying
it
3000
miles
i
noticed
the
bestby
date
was
june
1999
so
i
had
grave
misgivings
about
even
drinking
but
even
with
an
abv
of
only
4
0
it
still
had
the
sweet
malty
taste
poured
with
a
good
head
some
lace
malty
nose
ruby
amber
color
too
bad
it
is
only
a
250ml
bottle
browner
then
amber
in
color
with
a
handsome
crown
of
offwhite
foam
thats
tall
thick
rich
and
steady
some
patchy
lace
sticks
but
most
of
it
drips
back
down
smell
is
a
dirty
musty
lightly
roasty
malts
and
grains
taste
is
cleaner
but
i
sense
alot
of
grains
its
got
a
touch
of
roastyness
and
light
hops
with
a
crispy
finish
quite
empty
in
taste
and
feel
not
impressed
at
all
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
its
a
smooth
and
crisp
refresher
of
a
beer
but
beyond
that
yawn
notes
this
might
be
the
benchmark
irish
ale
i
hadnt
had
this
in
about
1012
years
and
its
as
good
as
i
remember
i
am
extatic
that
this
is
available
at
the
liquor
store
2
blocks
from
my
home
it
remains
an
excellent
example
of
an
excellent
style
if
you
see
this
beer
buy
it
it
is
absolutely
the
cats
pyjamas
f
a
well
crafted
ale
not
what
i
would
consider
a
bitter
though
poured
into
the
glass
smoothly
with
a
large
rushing
head
that
dissipated
after
a
minute
or
two
slight
rustic
gold
coloration
a
2
inch
head
and
thin
lace
that
creeps
towards
the
bottom
ahh
lovely
smell
smooth
malt
aroma
and
a
spicybitter
hop
kick
too
wake
up
your
nose
now
the
taste
hmm
sweet
at
first
mild
bitter
aftertaste
from
the
hops
malt
overpowers
the
taste
though
the
bitterness
does
try
damn
hard
clean
mouthfeel
drinkable
a
little
sweet
for
its
style
but
overall
a
very
good
drinkable
brew
i
shall
purchase
again
out
of
the
2
traditional
irish
ales
i
drink
regularly
smithwicks
and
killkenny
the
smithwicks
is
one
that
can
be
had
in
larger
quantities
but
the
creamy
smoothness
of
killkenny
still
calls
my
name
more
frequently
than
here
having
said
that
dont
shy
away
from
smithwicks
as
it
too
is
a
very
good
ale
make
that
great
ale
from
irelands
oldest
brewery
1710
but
now
owned
by
guinness
comes
an
impressive
wellmade
brew
there
are
several
versions
this
one
is
at
5
0
and
exported
to
canada
the
bottle
is
embossed
with
the
arthur
guinness
name
and
the
metallic
green
label
is
in
both
english
and
french
its
a
deep
brasscopper
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
and
a
surprising
rocky
offwhite
head
that
holds
exceptionally
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
the
nose
expresses
an
earthy
character
with
just
a
light
touch
of
diacetyl
very
english
in
nature
the
body
is
medium
and
quite
smooth
creamy
in
the
mouth
although
the
carbonation
seems
quite
standard
the
flavor
starts
gently
fruity
then
quickly
displays
some
sweetish
caramel
malt
as
it
warms
along
with
some
leafy
hop
character
and
finishes
dry
with
a
long
lingering
soft
and
nutty
caramel
note
and
some
residual
earthiness
really
nicely
balanced
with
a
firm
bitterness
that
supports
the
malt
but
never
really
comes
forward
full
flavored
but
also
very
drinkable
i
spent
2
weeks
in
ireland
and
spent
much
of
that
time
constantly
looking
for
another
pint
of
this
wonderful
ale
its
right
alongside
guinness
in
every
pub
but
cant
be
found
in
the
uk
i
like
it
better
than
bass
although
the
guinness
is
definitely
better
in
ireland
than
in
the
states
i
had
a
hard
time
having
anything
but
a
smithwicks
like
guinness
the
irish
version
is
far
superior
to
the
american
version
i
made
the
mistake
of
pronouncing
the
w
in
a
smokey
rundown
local
pub
outside
of
cork
city
the
first
time
i
asked
for
one
thats
something
youre
sure
to
do
only
once
full
bodied
ale
but
rather
flat
tasting
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
may
be
an
aquired
taste
as
the
more
i
sampled
the
more
appealing
it
came
to
me
the
colour
is
exceptional
this
brew
does
have
character
in
that
it
avoided
a
negative
rating
and
i
dont
know
how
on
tap
at
the
tara
cross
here
in
ottawa
comes
with
a
nice
darkish
red
colour
and
offwhite
head
smooth
taste
of
malts
but
not
overly
heavy
certainly
drinkable
i
have
to
say
i
prefer
the
nitro
of
kilkenny
but
this
is
certainly
a
fine
beer
i
reviewed
this
beer
previously
but
had
this
on
tap
again
in
canada
this
past
weekend
and
it
was
not
what
i
remembered
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
lovely
rich
looking
dark
amber
ale
with
a
creamy
smooth
tan
head
not
an
overly
complex
aroma
though
its
a
welcoming
one
exhitbiting
that
same
inviting
malty
richness
the
color
suggests
a
smooth
full
mouthfeel
is
complimented
by
the
well
rounded
full
maltgrain
bill
a
spicey
hop
character
pokes
through
maybe
challenger
this
is
a
standout
brew
in
a
sea
of
mediocre
red
ales
it
did
a
fine
job
washing
down
a
meal
though
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
alone
i
loved
this
beer
when
i
went
to
ireland
great
irish
ale
impossible
to
find
in
the
states
they
have
an
agreement
with
harp
and
as
long
as
harp
is
here
no
smithwicks
smooth
and
amazing
taste
nice
foamy
head
too
my
first
experience
with
smithwicks
was
on
the
planes
to
and
from
shannon
its
nothing
spectacular
but
its
better
than
most
irish
reds
i
havent
seen
it
around
many
places
in
the
states
but
its
not
a
beer
id
go
in
search
of
anyhow
poured
from
a
nitrocan
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
has
the
cascade
effect
into
a
caramel
coloring
with
a
dense
smooth
cream
colored
head
aromas
of
tangy
cream
sugary
and
caramel
sweet
notes
and
roasted
notes
flavors
are
roasted
sweet
forward
with
caramel
and
nutty
notes
blending
together
and
some
sugary
highlights
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
and
the
nitro
really
rounds
out
any
edges
tangy
and
sugary
aftertaste
most
noticeably
caramel
linger
through
the
smooth
easy
finish
classic
and
easy
enough
to
drink
but
there
are
better
cream
ales
out
there
i
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
kilkenny
i
picked
up
my
obligatory
st
pattys
4
pack
of
nitro
cans
today
this
really
is
a
lovely
looking
beer
i
do
love
the
cascading
action
as
it
assembles
itself
for
consumption
the
aroma
is
a
faint
bread
and
yeast
and
the
flavour
is
super
soft
on
the
palate
this
is
beer
for
people
who
dont
really
like
beer
in
many
ways
my
wife
loves
it
overall
though
drinking
a
kilkenny
is
a
good
thing
maybe
i
drank
differently
then
i
was
supposed
to
but
it
tasted
like
water
with
a
little
bit
of
milk
to
me
these
draught
can
cream
ales
are
not
supposed
to
be
in
your
face
they
are
mellow
have
low
abv
and
are
meant
for
easy
drinking
this
one
fits
the
mold
perfectly
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
youll
taste
overall
decent
irish
red
wouldnt
not
drink
again
the
creamy
texture
is
the
only
thing
this
one
really
has
going
for
it
macro
flavor
with
nothing
that
really
stands
out
really
smooth
creamy
enjoyable
beer
i
love
this
creamy
beer
not
a
lot
of
flavour
but
i
like
it
i
dont
mind
having
one
once
in
awhile
but
it
is
not
a
beer
i
actively
seek
out
aroma
and
flavor
is
caramel
malts
mild
fruit
and
nitrocreamy
finish
not
bad
but
probably
would
have
been
a
little
better
without
the
nitro
i
think
this
is
a
enjoyable
choice
i
could
see
myself
grabbing
some
of
these
for
the
holidays
as
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
the
consistency
of
light
eggnog
not
the
taste
definately
better
than
the
winter
spirit
i
reviewed
and
has
a
lot
more
going
for
it
as
far
as
appearance
body
and
complex
flavors
not
everyone
may
like
it
but
definately
is
a
nice
change
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
cheers
overall
this
is
not
really
a
spectacular
beer
i
have
had
a
lot
of
better
beers
a
lot
but
this
one
allows
me
to
wax
nostalgic
its
better
than
a
lot
of
beers
out
there
but
if
i
had
just
had
this
one
for
the
first
time
it
would
honestly
get
probably
a
3
5
or
3
75
but
i
am
biased
based
upon
a
youthful
tromp
through
europe
when
i
drank
this
beer
many
years
ago
it
still
good
if
you
can
find
it
try
it
for
yourself
i
wish
they
would
make
it
more
readily
available
in
this
part
of
the
usa
i
would
buy
it
more
often
for
sure
o
delicious
toasted
red
nothing
special
kind
of
tasteless
would
i
recommend
it
its
a
small
yes
just
give
it
a
try
if
you
are
at
the
bar
but
dont
buy
a
whole
pack
i
had
this
at
ri
ra
at
mandalay
bay
in
vegas
a
very
drinkable
irish
ale
soft
creamy
mouthfeel
nothing
extraordinary
but
rather
tasty
lightly
carbonated
and
malty
not
extremely
hoppy
a
few
hints
of
citrus
bot
nothing
overt
it
has
a
nice
finish
went
perfectly
with
fish
chips
i
used
to
not
care
about
red
beers
but
now
i
have
to
say
i
really
enjoy
kilkenny
very
drinkable
this
rating
is
for
having
it
on
tap
in
ireland
in
the
can
i
would
give
it
3
65
on
tap
it
has
a
delicious
creamy
body
and
iron
flavor
o
great
beer
it
belongs
to
one
of
my
favorite
beer
style
i
love
the
nitro
widget
on
offer
in
the
canned
variety
what
a
novelty
the
creamy
texture
really
does
it
for
me
with
this
ale
it
has
a
deep
reddish
hue
topped
off
with
a
thick
layer
of
cream
i
feel
really
indulgent
when
i
drink
this
beer
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
has
not
yet
experienced
it
this
is
a
beer
that
is
totally
different
on
nitro
draft
and
scores
can
vary
a
lot
very
smooth
eay
to
drink
red
ale
import
has
much
better
flavor
ok
n
nitro
draft
vs
can
sooth
light
caramel
malt
very
low
hop
presence
creamy
fluffy
white
head
and
a
sliky
smooth
body
overall
a
nice
beer
one
that
highlights
subtle
malt
and
nut
flavours
and
could
be
likened
to
a
lighter
less
roasty
guinness
in
a
good
way
it
is
not
as
complex
as
i
would
have
hoped
but
is
ahead
of
a
lot
of
other
macro
beers
out
there
definitely
relies
on
the
nitrogen
carbonation
to
stand
out
but
worth
trying
anyway
o
lacked
a
lot
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
needs
a
lot
more
flavor
to
give
me
any
reason
to
come
back
for
more
hopefully
this
was
just
a
bad
experience
since
i
did
not
have
it
on
tap
medium
bodied
with
a
watery
drying
finish
very
light
effervescence
a
smooth
brew
easily
quaffed
in
quantity
and
agreeable
to
the
palate
not
a
standout
but
a
solid
performer
i
do
not
have
much
experience
with
british
beers
and
am
right
now
trying
to
learn
more
personally
i
found
it
a
very
decent
beer
which
i
plan
to
try
again
and
see
how
my
tastebuds
will
judge
it
o
the
entire
time
i
was
drinking
this
i
kept
thinking
that
it
was
just
a
nuttier
version
of
guinness
draught
with
a
copper
body
i
dont
think
thats
such
a
bad
thing
though
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
bit
of
flavor
to
it
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
especially
at
4
3
abv
nitrogen
or
bust
though
sampled
from
a
pint
glass
serving
type
ontap
o
the
lack
of
aroma
and
taste
of
this
beer
is
a
bummer
because
it
looks
proper
and
drinks
amazingly
smooth
it
drinks
very
very
smooth
and
is
quite
refreshing
however
not
overly
enjoyable
reminds
me
of
drinking
cream
soda
as
a
kid
growing
up
good
memories
but
ill
pass
on
this
going
forward
as
it
is
too
sweet
for
me
o
on
a
warmhot
day
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
not
one
i
would
go
back
to
very
often
i
think
my
wife
would
love
it
i
decided
to
try
kilkenny
ale
tonight
because
it
was
the
only
offering
at
the
bar
that
i
had
yet
to
sample
and
apparently
i
discovered
why
this
beer
not
more
popular
overall
i
had
not
tried
this
beer
for
perhaps
15
to
20
years
and
did
so
largely
because
i
was
getting
bored
of
guinness
i
would
only
drink
this
again
in
similar
circumstances
and
will
not
be
seeking
it
out
a
very
enjoyable
afternoon
beer
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
very
popular
as
well
had
my
first
in
amsterdam
im
surprised
its
not
been
added
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
and
night
get
bored
taste
is
similarly
sweet
with
a
creamy
velvety
mouthfeel
has
a
slightly
bitter
pang
to
the
midpalate
but
finish
and
linger
are
creamy
and
soft
main
palate
tastes
of
that
irish
cream
with
a
slight
herb
flavour
and
a
distinct
vinegar
acidity
on
the
back
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
one
might
expect
it
to
be
sweeter
it
is
interesting
and
rewarding
though
but
not
as
quaffable
as
it
may
have
been
still
very
pleasant
drinking
and
a
great
afterdinner
drop
the
brewery
tacks
the
slogan
smooth
and
distinguished
onto
each
can
smooth
by
default
yes
distinguished
someone
please
get
these
people
a
dictionary
is
that
meant
to
be
tongueincheek
let
me
be
plain
and
simple
this
doesnt
smell
taste
or
feel
like
beer
and
you
could
make
the
case
about
this
artificial
carbonation
so
in
my
mind
it
simply
isnt
drinkability
i
will
not
be
drinking
kilkenny
from
a
can
for
a
long
time
though
im
tempted
to
give
it
a
second
chance
on
tap
overall
its
good
but
as
a
fan
of
irish
reds
i
think
the
taste
profile
could
be
better
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
carbonated
with
just
a
little
fizz
nice
and
easy
to
take
down
a
really
nice
session
beer
with
the
low
abv
what
a
great
brew
to
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
with
friends
arrived
as
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
creamy
white
bubbles
filter
to
the
top
as
it
settles
making
for
a
bit
of
a
show
the
taste
was
a
delicious
creamy
slightly
sweet
flavor
with
some
mild
bitterness
really
smooth
and
tasty
though
a
bit
dry
in
the
end
it
reminds
me
of
a
really
good
guinness
but
not
as
heavy
drinkability
the
lowalcohol
hightaste
is
a
winner
many
of
these
could
be
put
down
in
a
night
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
ireland
numerous
times
on
a
trip
there
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
outstanding
very
nice
mix
of
hoppiness
and
malts
with
a
stronger
malt
character
the
head
stayed
with
the
beer
the
whole
glass
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
i
wish
it
was
available
here
d
a
refreshing
change
from
guinness
and
when
the
bar
runs
out
of
it
then
you
shouldnt
be
disappointed
the
body
gets
in
the
way
of
its
endless
drinkablity
however
i
enjoy
the
style
and
its
certainly
more
friendly
per
pint
then
guinness
if
you
like
guinness
than
revel
in
a
new
found
beer
final
thoughts
when
i
think
this
beer
i
think
of
guinness
this
is
probably
because
of
the
nitrogen
tap
that
being
said
this
beer
seems
to
suffer
from
all
the
flaws
of
guinness
heavy
bitter
aftertaste
with
few
of
the
advantages
rich
and
strong
flavor
creamy
feel
frankly
that
would
be
fine
if
the
beer
was
lighter
to
the
stomach
i
would
probably
never
buy
this
beer
again
its
far
too
heavy
for
far
too
little
flavor
ive
always
been
content
with
this
as
a
perfunctory
default
at
that
sort
of
bar
both
here
and
even
in
eire
herself
but
now
upon
closer
circumspection
a
few
blemishes
become
increasingly
evident
a
certain
plainness
all
around
be
it
malt
hop
or
well
overall
flavour
which
i
suppose
is
this
ones
appeal
at
the
pub
toss
in
the
lower
than
average
abv
and
this
beer
is
sessionability
incarnate
a
light
aroma
of
malt
but
not
much
to
speak
of
the
flavour
is
quite
dry
with
a
grainy
malt
backbone
pretty
bitter
but
still
light
on
the
hops
pretty
reminiscent
of
a
guinness
for
me
creamy
mouthfeel
and
pretty
soft
carbonation
not
too
bad
it
has
a
deep
and
dark
red
body
with
beautiful
cloudy
carbonation
unit
the
beer
settles
the
head
is
amazingly
frothy
and
creamy
both
the
head
and
lace
stick
around
until
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
head
does
get
thin
it
just
seems
to
settle
to
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
just
like
most
irish
beers
it
is
more
about
malt
than
hops
it
is
hardly
bitter
at
all
the
flavor
is
bread
like
with
a
mild
amount
of
caramel
it
has
thick
mouthfeel
and
is
mildly
creamy
it
is
creamier
in
the
can
than
on
tap
in
my
opinion
a
good
ale
to
drink
anytime
of
the
year
pours
a
really
nice
tea
like
red
with
a
thick
white
head
that
stays
until
the
beer
is
done
nice
sticky
lacing
that
follows
the
beer
to
the
end
of
the
glass
for
smell
and
taste
i
couldnt
get
that
much
very
very
smooth
with
almost
no
carbonation
could
easily
have
another
but
the
taste
just
isnt
there
for
the
price
of
a
4
pack
i
dont
think
im
going
to
buy
another
one
of
these
for
awhile
ultimately
this
beer
is
pleasant
nothing
tickles
my
fancy
or
even
gets
me
really
interested
however
it
is
certainly
not
a
disappointing
or
offensive
brew
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
cant
sing
its
praises
poured
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
thick
reddish
hue
to
the
color
sweet
smell
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
i
enjoyed
this
beer
nevertheless
not
heavy
and
goes
down
smooth
would
drink
again
given
the
chance
its
better
than
caffreys
to
me
cheers
drinkabilty
my
goodness
i
really
did
struggle
to
get
it
all
down
but
in
the
end
i
did
due
to
passing
it
around
for
others
to
try
some
liked
others
didnt
just
too
watery
absolutelty
nothing
to
invite
me
back
for
another
one
a
shame
really
drinkability
is
good
as
well
it
feels
so
wonderfully
velvety
rich
in
the
mouth
but
its
not
filling
and
it
finishes
to
nothing
very
quickly
and
theres
so
little
carbonic
acidity
and
flavour
that
i
could
chug
these
all
evening
d
very
good
wish
i
could
get
this
at
home
it
truly
is
better
than
guinness
and
boddingtons
and
i
know
buy
into
the
hype
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
it
wasnt
2
50
a
can
i
have
found
that
many
others
i
work
with
have
also
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
but
bummed
about
its
distribution
i
first
discovered
this
beer
through
a
friend
at
a
gym
i
go
to
he
is
british
and
was
familiar
with
many
beers
from
the
uk
i
was
tired
of
the
same
old
beers
we
have
here
in
this
little
province
of
pei
canada
so
he
suggested
i
try
some
english
and
irish
beers
kilkenny
was
my
first
ive
tired
a
dozen
or
so
others
but
keep
coming
back
to
kilkenny
its
my
favorite
of
all
smoothest
ive
ever
tastes
and
really
goes
with
almost
anything
its
texture
is
so
creamy
and
the
head
is
so
dense
and
inviting
recently
it
became
available
here
not
sure
if
its
because
of
my
pleading
everyone
who
come
over
i
give
them
a
glass
full
and
no
one
has
ever
not
been
impressed
with
it
i
highly
recommend
people
try
it
out
drinkability
high
good
abv
for
sitting
in
the
sun
d
excellent
drinkablity
i
had
plenty
of
these
while
in
europe
d
virtually
no
abv
but
goes
down
real
smooth
a
nice
drink
id
like
to
have
access
to
once
in
a
while
id
give
it
the
nod
over
guinness
better
layers
of
flavor
d
a
night
in
an
irish
pub
in
europe
is
a
great
time
this
beer
helped
push
the
party
on
d
this
is
not
my
favourite
style
but
i
must
say
that
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
so
i
could
see
myself
downing
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
its
also
relatively
low
in
alcohol
so
you
could
have
a
few
before
you
really
feel
it
however
i
still
find
the
flavour
quite
muted
so
i
dont
know
how
much
of
this
i
plan
to
drink
in
the
future
nothing
id
order
again
and
really
wouldnt
recommend
trying
d
couldnt
go
for
another
at
4
3
abv
it
is
highly
quaffable
but
im
not
really
a
fan
it
lacks
an
essential
character
that
others
in
the
style
have
i
enjoy
others
in
the
style
but
the
taste
and
weak
mouthfeel
throws
me
off
might
be
better
on
tap
deep
amber
colored
almost
orange
topped
by
a
creamy
white
head
that
lasts
all
the
way
down
thanks
nitro
it
has
a
toasted
aroma
with
just
a
little
creaminess
similar
flavor
too
but
a
little
sweeter
as
it
warms
up
a
little
fruitiness
creeps
from
underneath
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
palate
light
and
dry
like
many
nitroinfused
beers
its
quaffable
making
this
a
solid
selection
for
a
session
beer
certainly
better
than
smithwicks
and
one
beer
i
wish
was
sold
in
the
states
i
would
interchange
this
with
murphys
and
beamish
at
the
irish
pub
i
routinely
go
to
overall
a
decent
brew
that
goes
well
with
most
food
especially
basic
pub
fare
worth
a
try
review
translated
from
french
6112008
overall
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
brand
of
beer
it
simply
has
everything
you
can
ask
for
out
of
a
beer
one
benefit
of
starting
to
actually
critique
the
beer
you
drink
is
a
growing
awareness
of
the
nitrocan
i
find
it
hard
to
look
at
this
beer
the
same
way
i
did
a
year
ago
the
layered
head
is
twoplus
fingers
with
amazing
retention
and
foamy
presence
yet
there
appears
to
be
no
carbonation
feint
odour
of
grain
yeast
theres
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
mouth
mildly
bitter
rye
bread
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
sweet
actually
it
isnt
anywhere
rich
as
it
looks
and
i
think
it
drinks
quite
well
for
a
cream
ale
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
try
this
on
tap
sometime
ah
the
cascading
display
that
is
the
nirocan
after
the
show
i
was
left
with
a
rich
copper
brown
brew
very
clear
with
a
gorgeous
off
white
to
tan
head
as
thick
as
cream
that
really
never
went
away
some
rich
roasted
malt
aroma
is
prevalent
if
you
can
get
past
that
head
that
acts
like
a
aroma
seal
some
immediate
tealike
bitterness
followed
by
a
sudden
rush
of
roasted
caramel
malt
which
never
overpowers
the
experience
the
drying
finish
is
there
along
with
some
hop
bitterness
altough
somewhat
creamy
and
very
smooth
it
was
a
tad
on
the
watery
side
still
very
drinkable
in
large
quantities
by
this
reviewer
this
beer
is
an
example
of
what
every
irish
red
would
hope
to
be
from
the
first
pour
it
resembles
a
guinness
with
the
dark
red
color
and
thick
white
head
its
as
smooth
as
beer
gets
the
flavor
resembles
a
somewhat
fruity
amber
with
a
surprisingly
short
aftertaste
this
is
the
type
of
beer
you
have
to
unwind
and
relax
since
it
is
a
heavy
brew
the
only
con
i
can
think
of
it
getting
a
hold
of
it
i
have
only
had
it
in
montreal
well
worth
the
trip
possibly
im
being
a
little
generous
but
this
is
a
real
easy
drinker
with
no
clear
flaws
apart
from
the
watery
mouthfeel
i
prefer
kilkenny
over
guinness
when
given
the
choice
on
most
occassions
but
i
have
somewhat
lost
my
fondness
after
an
awful
st
patricks
day
hangover
excellant
mouth
to
this
one
medium
body
that
goes
down
thin
but
creamy
at
the
same
timevery
very
smoothand
the
head
that
turns
into
a
nice
14
inch
collarstays
with
you
all
along
and
adds
to
the
creaminesswonderful
to
drinkcould
easily
drink
3
or
4
of
these
at
500
ml
before
moving
on
to
some
thing
else
very
enjoyable
and
highly
reccomended
cute
waitress
wrote
yay
in
the
foam
on
top
it
stuck
around
for
a
while
in
a
thick
foam
about
an
inch
over
a
deep
red
colored
beer
looked
amazing
unfortunately
appearances
can
be
deceiving
nose
was
nearly
nonexistant
just
some
very
light
caramel
malt
i
think
i
got
my
nose
wet
trying
to
find
any
odor
taste
was
likewise
extremely
mild
caramel
malt
body
was
excellent
thick
and
creamy
overall
this
one
wasnt
terrible
but
i
really
could
do
with
a
little
more
kick
in
my
beers
thick
creamy
guinness
like
head
slightly
lighter
in
colour
slightly
bolder
taste
than
smithwicks
a
little
more
full
bodied
i
felt
i
did
have
in
on
nonnitro
and
it
seemed
even
more
full
bodied
nitro
had
slightly
drier
finish
good
beer
anyhow
another
british
ale
that
just
didnt
please
my
palate
yet
my
friends
tell
me
that
someday
my
ale
will
come
this
beer
has
a
darker
colour
than
i
normally
like
i
prefer
golden
nectars
and
a
weak
aroma
it
went
down
very
smooth
however
it
felt
thick
in
the
mouth
very
little
carbonation
the
flavour
was
alright
very
malty
the
taste
is
simple
a
balance
of
malt
and
hops
that
quenches
more
than
it
does
excite
the
palate
a
supersmooth
mouthfeel
and
easy
drinkability
makes
this
one
good
for
people
who
are
looking
for
something
light
or
people
who
dont
enjoy
beer
much
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
a
pretty
good
rendition
if
youre
not
this
isnt
going
to
change
your
mind
i
had
this
brew
on
tap
at
a
cafe
during
a
late
afternoon
walk
around
milan
its
a
light
yellow
colored
liquid
with
a
very
slim
head
the
aroma
is
faint
with
a
slight
whiff
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
grass
not
much
else
to
speak
of
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
similar
a
hint
of
grain
and
a
touch
of
hops
theres
also
a
slight
sweetness
the
consistency
of
the
brew
is
watery
with
modest
carbonation
frankly
it
reminds
me
of
an
american
lawnmower
beer
it
served
to
quench
my
thirst
but
didnt
excite
the
beer
lover
inside
like
caffreys
irish
ale
kilkenny
is
very
impressive
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
thick
reddish
hue
to
the
color
sweet
smell
with
a
smooth
dry
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
great
beer
to
just
sit
back
and
drink
all
night
mouthfeel
only
jesus
himself
could
create
a
creamier
beer
than
this
not
just
because
of
the
nitro
can
its
just
a
dessert
of
a
beer
drinkability
very
highh
its
far
from
bad
but
its
not
really
outstanding
either
an
optimist
might
call
it
balanced
a
pessimist
might
call
it
dull
id
just
call
it
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
have
no
qualms
with
buying
this
again
but
it
probably
wont
be
a
priority
the
taste
is
slightly
tealike
which
conforms
to
the
style
and
reminded
me
of
caffreys

though
better
the
mouthfeel
and
overall
effect
were
more
flavourful
with
roasted
malt
and
a
dry
finish
a
nice
full
body
and
creamy
mouthfeel
too
not
bad
but
the
finish
hurts
the
overall
beer
experience
mouthfeel
okay
but
i
didnt
make
it
past
the
halfway
mark
overall
a
very
disappointing
beer
d
ive
only
had
this
beer
a
couple
of
times
once
a
while
back
and
now
i
didnt
enjoy
it
either
time
because
it
is
watery
with
low
abv
it
goes
down
easily
enough
but
it
is
not
really
a
pleasant
experience
a
nice
beer
but
not
even
close
to
the
pint
of
kilkenny
i
had
on
tap
recently
still
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
was
very
attractive
with
its
thick
head
and
red
color
it
felt
as
smooth
as
it
looked
which
was
delightful
the
taste
was
good
however
i
felt
like
it
could
have
been
richer
to
go
along
with
the
look
and
feel
of
the
beer
rather
it
was
kind
of
light
which
did
make
it
quite
drinkable
but
i
felt
took
me
in
the
wrong
direction
overall
a
good
beer
though
far
better
than
what
i
typically
get
on
tap
good
for
morning
tea
this
is
one
for
a
session
i
have
had
kilkenny
many
times
over
the
years
but
had
not
really
appreciated
it
until
i
had
it
recently
served
at
the
right
temperature
and
poured
correctly
at
the
harp
pub
in
tempe
australia
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
beer
was
a
nice
redamber
colour
with
an
inchthick
creamy
head
that
stayed
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
was
minimal
but
smelled
slightly
malty
taste
was
smooth
and
slightly
toffeesweet
with
minimal
bitterness
very
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
was
halfway
through
my
pint
before
i
knew
it
i
wouldnt
say
this
was
a
great
beer
by
any
standard
but
a
good
session
beer
to
be
sure
pours
clear
and
reddish
with
a
moderate
white
head
faint
aroma
of
caramel
with
toasty
overtones
flavour
is
the
same
but
weaker
than
aroma
thanks
to
a
faint
butterscotch
sweetness
no
hops
low
carbonation
and
the
overpowering
flavour
of
the
nitro
widget
some
faint
lingering
astringency
disappointing
overall
pours
out
to
a
reddish
cherrywood
color
with
a
stormy
presenation
that
calms
slowly
leaving
a
dense
creamy
head
of
foam
nice
aromas
of
toasted
bread
and
grains
taste
is
quite
light
nearly
weak
light
malt
caramel
some
tea
like
bitterness
not
bad
but
too
light
mouthfeel
was
good
rather
creamy
and
smooth
drinkability
is
average
not
bad
but
needs
a
big
boost
in
the
taste
dept
worth
a
try
drinkability
not
bad
this
one
is
pretty
light
has
nothing
objectionable
and
of
course
its
got
the
nitro
going
for
it
definitely
a
session
candidate
think
of
it
as
boddingtons
irish
cousin
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
if
i
go
to
pub
i
always
get
a
pint
of
kilkenny
it
might
not
be
that
great
to
savor
but
it
will
do
for
a
long
night
of
drinking
and
debauchery
drinkable
just
not
that
enjoyable
drinkability
high
drinkability
and
moderate
alcohol
content
make
this
a
solid
session
beer
comes
out
with
a
nice
auburn
copper
color
and
a
thicker
egg
white
head
looks
like
a
lighter
guinness
from
the
pour
good
sheets
of
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
is
weak
maybe
some
toffee
and
pear
but
thats
about
all
i
get
taste
is
also
too
weak
for
my
liking
some
caramel
is
in
there
along
with
hints
of
fruity
hops
creamy
in
mouthfeel
but
this
is
still
a
bit
too
watery
for
me
just
kind
of
bland
all
around
i
could
session
this
but
why
would
i
want
to
reminds
me
of
wexfords
offering
but
not
as
good
not
impressive
mouthfeel
is
total
nitro
creamy
lightly
bubbly
needs
to
lose
a
bit
of
the
metallic
harshness
to
become
more
drinkable
amber
colour
with
lace
only
a
bit
of
head
light
mouthfeel
creamy
and
on
dry
side
not
much
taste
but
quaffable
in
fact
quite
smooth
good
amount
of
malt
and
some
carmel
decent
aftertaste
though
drying
session
ale
whiff
of
roast
in
aroma
440
ml
d
its
a
little
filling
but
its
still
a
great
session
beer
it
use
to
be
my
winter
staple
very
hearty
the
mouthfeel
is
utterly
amazing
the
carbonation
levels
are
absolutely
perfect
and
the
beer
is
absolutely
silky
smooth
with
a
good
body
to
it
id
certainly
have
trouble
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
session
despite
the
slightly
lower
alcohol
content
but
its
still
a
joy
to
drink
on
those
occasions
when
i
do
want
to
treat
myself
to
something
a
little
pricier
and
for
that
it
still
scores
some
points
in
the
drinkability
category
kilkenny
irish
cream
ale
is
certainly
worth
a
try
and
i
will
say
that
if
nothing
else
its
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
ever
had
that
presents
just
as
well
from
a
can
or
bottle
as
it
does
on
draft
kilkenny
is
not
run
of
the
mill
macro
swill
but
still
not
very
good
at
all
somehow
i
just
feel
the
recipe
probably
is
decent
but
the
brewer
tried
to
use
cheaper
ingredients
and
faster
methods
and
this
is
the
result
smell
is
very
sweet
slight
roasted
malts
not
much
of
a
bitter
or
hoppy
smell
to
speak
of
taste
is
quite
bitter
and
roasted
slight
sweetness
but
the
scales
tip
on
the
side
of
bitterness
not
much
complexity
mouthfeel
is
extremely
watery
nothing
to
bite
the
tongue
at
all
maybe
this
is
a
nitro
thing
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
though
i
like
to
feel
the
beer
in
my
mouth
sticks
to
the
throat
though
dry
finish
slides
down
like
nothing
at
all
drinkable
but
not
so
much
my
thing
this
is
my
favourite
irish
red
which
isnt
that
big
of
an
accomplishment
seeing
how
the
style
isnt
really
for
me
i
can
honestly
say
if
you
do
like
irish
reds
you
probably
will
love
this
one
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
light
beige
head
consistent
with
other
nitro
beers
ive
had
thick
and
creamy
smells
pleasant
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
slight
with
some
smooth
malts
and
hops
presenting
the
most
strongly
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
an
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
clear
light
copper
under
a
thick
one
finger
light
beige
head
that
lasts
literally
forever
most
of
it
was
still
there
when
i
drained
the
glass
very
little
lacing
however
interesting
theres
a
pleasant
nose
here
of
malt
and
spice
with
a
touch
of
cinnamon
sweetness
the
mouth
is
light
clean
and
mildly
carbonated
smooth
as
milk
somehow
everything
about
the
taste
is
mild
here
opening
malt
with
a
touch
of
fruit
followed
by
some
dry
and
bitter
hops
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
fades
fairly
quickly
leaving
a
watery
feel
its
ok
if
you
have
no
better
choice
but
the
experience
is
ultimately
unsatisfying
drinkability
was
rather
a
nice
thirst
quencher
at
the
time
but
other
than
that
nothing
spectacular
it
disappointed
as
i
think
it
was
a
better
drink
from
the
can
i
brought
a
bunch
of
the
delicious
brew
back
from
a
trip
to
ireland
several
years
ago
and
really
had
to
savor
each
can
because
when
i
asked
guinness
usa
why
this
beer
isnt
available
in
the
us
they
told
me
that
it
would
be
a
direct
competitior
to
the
pub
can
stout
that
they
produce
fair
it
would
take
away
from
sales
of
the
original
im
sure
but
this
is
s
completely
different
style
of
beer
this
is
a
redcream
ale
with
an
enormous
and
beautiful
head
and
a
smell
of
a
heather
field
from
the
emerald
isle
herself
it
has
a
full
rich
body
with
malt
to
spare
and
the
finish
goes
on
forever
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
and
would
consider
trading
to
get
my
hands
on
more
drinkability
goes
down
unbelievably
easy
i
could
toss
these
back
all
night
long
but
nothing
memorable
except
for
the
smooth
feel
bleech
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
kilkenny
but
i
hadnt
tried
one
in
several
years
and
thought
it
was
worth
another
shot
especially
since
its
my
brotherinlaws
favourite
beer
bought
a
4
pack
and
split
it
with
him
both
of
these
wound
up
going
down
the
drain
i
cant
get
this
pine
taste
out
of
my
mouth
i
feel
like
ive
been
sucking
on
a
branch
of
a
christmas
tree
i
dont
know
if
its
psychological
but
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
nitro
can
yet
that
i
enjoyed
shouldnt
be
the
nitro
that
puts
me
off
but
whatever
yuck
itll
be
several
years
before
i
have
one
of
these
again
unless
its
on
tap
that
might
make
a
difference
but
i
doubt
it
red
in
colour
with
your
typical
nitro
qualities
of
a
lasting
head
and
thick
mouthfeel
there
are
some
candysweet
malty
aromas
from
this
one
a
slight
mineral
note
and
a
somewhat
strange
veggie
smell
as
well
the
flavors
are
dominated
by
a
slightly
sweet
malt
component
along
with
some
ironlike
well
water
flavors
overall
its
an
ok
session
beer
but
nothing
special
ontap
served
in
the
proper
labelled
glass
a
nice
looking
inch
of
off
white
head
of
creamy
thick
bubbles
bright
clear
pale
amber
body
the
head
lasts
the
whole
way
down
with
full
coating
of
lace
on
the
glass
nitro
kills
alot
of
the
aroma
buyt
there
is
some
caramel
comining
through
full
flavored
with
toasted
caramel
malt
balanced
by
some
hop
bite
in
the
end
nice
creamy
thick
mouthfeel
and
it
goes
down
smooth
better
on
tap
than
from
the
nitrocan
pours
a
dark
red
color
almost
brown
smell
is
strong
like
a
traditional
lager
almost
like
stella
the
taste
is
like
a
lager
as
well
although
there
are
many
more
hops
added
to
it
its
almost
thick
going
down
no
doubt
due
to
the
nitrous
there
is
lots
of
overall
flavor
and
its
very
multifaceted
but
its
heavy
in
consistency
first
time
i
had
ever
saw
this
beernever
saw
it
in
the
u
s
poured
from
the
a
nitro
tap
a
deep
amber
with
a
nice
creamy
head
on
toppretty
blah
aromas
though
some
highly
kilned
malt
and
caramel
but
pretty
faint
like
alot
of
nitro
ales
flavors
are
pretty
weeknice
creamy
mouthfeel
helps
but
the
faint
caramel
sweetness
leafy
finish
is
just
to
faint
and
subdues
well
iam
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
but
its
not
something
i
would
look
for
again
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
are
after
if
you
want
a
beer
to
sit
and
drink
with
friends
this
is
a
good
one
but
if
you
want
to
focus
on
the
beer
there
isnt
much
to
keep
you
interested
in
the
long
run
its
a
little
pricey
as
well
but
overall
a
good
pub
beer
if
your
pub
has
limited
selections
not
bad
at
first
but
i
find
the
whole
ale
gets
downright
disappointing
by
the
time
ive
finished
half
a
glass
not
my
ale
of
choice
thats
for
sure
looks
good
out
of
the
can
dark
amber
with
strong
lacing
and
head
retention
a
little
too
good
and
artificiallooking
smell
chemical
aluminium
can
some
hop
scent
but
not
nice
taste
im
ambivalent
i
think
the
real
flavour
that
goes
with
this
beer
is
the
ashen
smell
and
taste
of
old
men
in
a
small
smoky
irish
pub
somewhat
lacking
when
the
surroundings
arent
right
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
a
little
harsh
from
carbonation
so
easy
to
drink
that
you
could
enjoy
it
anywhere
out
of
the
way
when
you
felt
like
a
few
pints
costs
too
much
for
what
it
is
but
its
better
than
a
lot
of
shit
they
try
and
serve
us
better
on
tap
but
very
nearly
on
par
in
the
widgetcans
it
is
right
in
between
caffrys
and
guinness
on
the
flavor
scale
drinkability
i
enjoyed
to
discover
this
brew
and
i
recommend
it
for
a
heavy
drinking
night
this
beer
was
in
a
nitro
can
i
forgot
to
put
it
in
that
category
worth
a
try
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
this
beer
was
as
advertised
deliciously
creamy
it
pours
sort
of
an
reddish
brown
the
appearance
is
almost
guiness
like
in
terms
of
the
thickness
of
the
head
it
does
not
have
a
particularly
pungent
smell
and
the
smell
is
that
of
a
typical
pub
ale
such
as
boddingtons
or
the
like
this
beers
greatest
attrubite
is
in
fact
its
spectacualrly
creamy
mouthfeel
a
great
session
beer
in
my
mind
and
always
better
on
tap
all
in
all
a
nice
ale
probably
will
buy
again
the
nitro
really
helps
the
head
and
creaminess
deep
coppery
brown
with
a
dense
cream
coloured
head
plenty
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
mild
with
some
floral
hops
and
light
toasted
malts
it
had
a
light
biscuit
or
toasted
malt
flavour
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
lingers
through
the
finish
fairly
smooth
partially
due
to
the
light
carbonation
and
it
had
a
light
body
dry
finish
partially
due
to
a
light
grain
astringency
notes
had
this
one
in
the
temple
bar
district
of
dublin
in
april
of
2004
nitro
can
poured
a
creamy
light
brown
beer
with
a
nice
thick
creamy
head
that
has
lasting
retention
the
head
is
similar
to
the
guinness
aroma
is
very
light
with
some
small
notes
of
malts
i
founded
the
taste
to
be
very
creamy
with
some
small
notes
of
roastiness
and
sweetness
this
beer
was
a
bit
dry
at
the
end
with
a
small
watery
aftertaste
but
again
subtler
then
guinness
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
session
beer
from
a
decent
brewery
i
do
not
really
know
cream
ales
enough
to
judge
this
one
on
another
basis
but
it
was
certainly
not
my
favourite
the
pour
brown
with
a
head
and
sinking
bubble
appearance
like
a
stout
immediately
releases
a
considerable
malt
aroma
that
describes
most
of
what
the
beer
is
extremely
sweet
on
a
full
body
with
no
carbonation
and
just
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
which
doesnt
match
with
the
rest
properly
back
in
the
days
when
i
was
totally
into
cream
ales
i
gave
this
one
a
try
upon
pouring
the
appearance
looked
very
nice
nice
creamy
head
darker
looking
red
ale
smelled
of
hops
and
malt
when
tasting
all
i
can
remember
is
tasting
what
i
thought
was
tin
not
very
impressed
for
the
available
cream
ales
we
have
here
i
reccomend
tetleys
anyday
although
i
dont
care
much
for
cream
ales
anymore
even
though
my
nickname
implys
i
love
it
back
to
the
belgians
for
me
do
not
bother
with
this
yet
another
inspid
creation
from
a
once
great
brewery
is
this
a
good
indication
of
the
style
im
not
sure
i
think
in
the
end
kilkenny
is
o
k
but
give
me
a
murphys
irish
red
any
day
of
the
week
poured
out
a
dark
red
with
a
thick
creamy
head
that
pretty
much
stayed
til
the
end
thick
lacing
too
not
particularly
exciting
no
strong
nose
no
strong
presence
in
the
mouth
a
light
hopy
aftertaste
it
was
just
too
thin
for
my
liking
if
offered
this
beer
at
somebodys
home
id
take
it
otherwise
i
wouldnt
bother

in

notes
overall
nothing
special
but
definantly
worth
it
for
a
night
of
constant
drinking
would
choose
the
draught
over
the
can
any
day
the
head
is
super
dense
and
levitates
on
a

hued
sea
smell
is
rather
meek
but
taste
is
slightly
fuller
taste
is
sweet
mellow
with
a
touch
of
vanilla
but
lacks
the
bite
of
other
red
ales
ive
had
such
as
erie
and
murphys
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
the
guiness
familythick
creamy

luscious
the
beer
is
drinkable

rather
boring

are

a
great
looking
ale
big
thick
creamy
head
topping
a
clear
pale
amber
body
the
head
lasts
the
whole
way
down
far
more
than
just
a
thin
cap
aroma
is
primarily
of
sweet
caramel
malt
taste
directly
matches
this
with
a
small
touch
of
hops
on
the
finish
nice
thick
mouthfeel
and
it
goes
down
velvety
smooth
nothing
exceptional
about
this
ale
its
actually
pretty
plain
and
average
and
very
straight
forward
but
it
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
and
it
sure
looks
pretty
aside
from
the
insanely
thick
and
dense
white
head
on
this
pint
i
really
cant
say
i
find
anything
special
about
this
one
the
color
is
a
reddish
amber
and
the
nose
reveals
very
little
about
this
one
it
goes
down
easy
enough
but
the
hops
andor
malts
just
arent
prominent
enough
for
me
i
was
expecting
alot
more
judging
by
the
looks
ah
well
at
least
at
this
pub
they
also
had
murphys
which
is
a
far
better
alternative
for
me
flavor
is
rich
and
creamy
with
a
sweet
maltiness
and
loads
of
apple
and
pear
fruitiness
light
caramel
flavor
with
a
mild
hopping
in
the
finish
provinding
some
dryness
smooth
creamy
texture
i
didnt
notice
any
metallic
taste
which
was
good
considering
it
came
from
a
can
pick
up
a
six
pack
at
the
liquor
store
at
the
end
of
this
review
all
that
remains
is
the
original
thick
creamy
head
minus
a
little
of
its
original
depth
there
are
so
many
versions
of
smithwickskilkenny
now
that
its
almost
impossible
to
keep
up
with
them
still
i
think
ive
got
it
under
the
right
heading
here
this
is
a
nitro
can
exported
to
canada
with
4
3
abv
it
pours
a
deep
copper
with
an
orangereddish
cast
the
offwhite
nitro
head
is
exceptionally
creamy
and
maintains
a
solid
14
cap
throughout
the
pint
well
14
ounces
anyway
it
leaves
some
nice
lace
and
gives
the
impression
of
a
proper
pint
within
the
nose
a
softly
sweet
and
gently
buttery
caramel
malt
darts
in
and
out
through
mildly
earthymineral
fuggles
hops
the
body
is
light
but
creamy
and
accentuates
the
balanced
toasty
caramelish
and
lightly
fruity
malt
it
finishes
dry
and
biscuity
with
a
lingering
note
of
dull
buttery
caramel
its
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
decent
amount
of
character
a
nice
session
beer
worth
trying
f
my
little
bro
introduced
me
to
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
and
alas
its
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
the
memories
of
it
do
not
waste
your
time
and
money
on
this
beer
if
you
buy
the
can
if
you
want
a
great
beer
drink
this
beer
from
a
tap
but
they
do
not
sell
this
beer
in
the
u
s
yet
what
a
waste
of
brewing
this
beer
and
putting
it
in
a
can
ive
heard
kilkenny
is
just
smithwicks
renamed
in
order
to
appeal
to
a
younger
crowd
but
i
can
assure
you
its
a
completely
different
beer
a
very
good
irish
red
ale
thats
an
excellent
session
beer
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
creamy
head
i
had
this
on
tap
while
in
ireland
but
i
believe
its
still
unavailable
in
any
form
in
the
us
which
is
a
shame
because
i
certainly
miss
it
cheers
first
one
was
pretty
smoothe
but
the
second
didnt
tase
as
well
readily
available
in
canada
i
regularly
partake
of
this
classic
beer
few
beers
have
a
better
appearance
than
kilkenny
the
deep
red
colour
and
cascading
carbonation
of
a
freshly
poured
pint
are
prime
examples
of
the
style
the
taste
is
near
heavenly
smooth
and
well
heeled
without
significant
bitterness
kilkenny
is
truly
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
daily
for
the
rest
of
my
life
and
be
a
happy
man
i
feel
sorry
for
americans
since
you
apparently
cant
find
kilkenny
in
the
states
my
favourite
beer
hands
down
a
hearty
irish
red
ale
unlike
the
watered
down
versions
we
typically
see
in
the
us
darker
too
than
most
with
a
pleasant
not
cloying
sweetness
a
smooth
easy
drinking
but
flavorful
session
ale
while
not
necessarily
something
to
be
sought
out
it
was
a
nice
find
amongst
the
many
pils
styles
on
a
recent
trip
to
europe
pours
a
nice
deep
red
amber
with
an
off
white
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
was
full
of
toasted
malt
and
caramel
scents
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
with
those
sweet
toasted
flavors
coming
through
in
the
beginning
before
a
crisp
finish
and
clean
aftertaste
really
liked
this
one
for
the
season
im
buzzed
i
liked
it
why
do
have
to
justify
my
answer
overall
this
is
a
delicious
irishstyle
red
ale
great
flavors
of
malt
and
sweetness
wrapped
up
in
a
creamy
beer
im
definitely
getting
a
six
pack
of
this
every
year
its
ok
but
i
dont
plan
a
return
trip
overall
a
decent
bog
standard
irish
red
ale
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
grains
taste
is
malts
caramel
some
grains
smooth
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
makes
for
a
fine
session
or
warm
weather
beer
pours
a
clear
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
toast
and
nut
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
toast
earth
and
nut
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
toast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
solid
toast
and
nut
qualities
all
around
overall
its
a
doable
red
ale
but
misses
some
of
the
malt
thickness
and
sweetness
i
am
expecting
oi
wasnt
expecting
to
like
this
as
much
as
i
did
smooth
malty
easy
to
drink
nothing
extraordinary
but
i
would
definitely
reach
for
one
of
these
again
maybe
its
the
4leaf
clovers
o
eh
its
pretty
damn
uneventful
this
beer
reminds
me
that
while
flying
dog
makes
some
great
stuff
on
occasion
the
truth
theyve
also
got
a
few
stinkers
in
the
lineup
hi
there
k9
natch
this
is
closer
to
the
latter
or
maybe
i
just
dont
like
this
style
that
much
i
mean
theres
little
to
differentiate
this
from
shudder
an
esb
to
me
this
one
isnt
going
to
be
repeat
purchase
pours
a
reddish
copper
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
that
lingered
a
bit
particularly
in
the
edges
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
malty
the
flavor
profile
is
driven
by
taste
of
amber
malt
and
includes
a
trace
of
sweetness
there
is
also
a
hint
of
cloves
in
the
flavor
the
tingling
dry
bitterness
on
the
finish
is
a
pleasant
way
to
end
a
decent
but
not
extraordinary
drinking
experience
o
an
average
red
ale
enough
said
overall
i
will
pretty
much
try
anything
for
a
buck
and
even
though
i
only
had
one
bad
flying
dog
brew
tire
bite
this
one
is
pretty
close
i
havent
had
the
old
scratch
in
forever
so
maybe
this
uses
the
same
recipe
regardless
it
wasnt
that
great
o
sort
of
a
bland
amber
ale
nothing
really
stands
out
or
will
be
rememberable
o
a
little
more
hoppy
than
other
reds
but
an
enjoyable
mix
of
flavors
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
lucky
offers
nice
flavor
without
overkill
overall
solid
all
day
irish
ale
compliments
to
the
brewer
on
this
one
spot
on
really
solid
example
of
the
style
a
little
more
hoppy
than
usual
not
sure
what
the
4
leaf
clovers
contributed
besides
being
a
marketing
ploy
nice
red
ale
even
after
that
boring
nose
recommended
a
fun
quaff
for
the
most
part
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
on
the
malty
side
or
pushing
the
envelope
in
other
ways
tastetoasted
malt
nice
little
kiss
of
hops
tangy
spicinesscould
this
be
the
4leaf
clovers
that
supposedly
used
in
the
brewing
of
this
beer
who
knows
that
being
said
this
ia
a
pleasant
drinkable
irish
red
clean
thats
the
word
that
struck
me
about
this
one
complete
clarity
visually
clean
flavor
profile
might
strike
some
as
thin
slick
sweetness
with
a
lot
of
malt
presence
but
nothing
too
out
there
easy
to
drink
not
really
all
that
inspiring
but
a
nice
enough
beer
overall
irish
red
ales
usually
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
pleasant
and
an
easy
flavorful
drinker
recommended
for
a
sampling
by
all
this
has
really
surpassed
my
expectations
as
a
beer
touting
that
its
brewed
with
4leaf
clovers
i
was
a
little
skeptical
forget
the
clovers
this
is
a
damn
good
irish
red
overall
decent
a
little
weak
but
for
a
5
5
beer
it
drinks
well
and
has
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
a
little
more
hop
kick
would
work
really
well
with
the
clover
leafy
flavors
still
good
a
nice
beer
to
drink
a
few
off
at
one
sitting
not
a
bad
irish
red
the
malt
bill
was
certainly
showcased
here
i
cant
really
speak
to
the
clover
though
i
guess
its
definitely
a
novel
marketing
concept
real
clover
in
the
boil
really
cool
i
didnt
get
any
clover
not
that
id
be
able
to
identify
the
taste
of
clover
from
the
beer
but
interesting
for
sure
beer
poured
a
nice
deep
reddish
hue
and
super
clean
clear
really
nice
tight
2
finger
head
that
remained
for
the
entire
drink
the
first
sip
was
really
nice
and
smooth
nothing
overpowering
anything
else
the
malt
and
hops
played
nicely
with
each
other
i
could
drink
this
all
day
really
nice
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
this
wasnt
anything
too
earth
shattering
for
an
irish
red
ale
but
its
flavorful
enough
with
a
nice
crisp
bite
to
it
that
keeps
this
quenching
on
the
palate
this
was
a
good
one
to
pair
up
with
some
barbecue
here
decent
beer
here
poured
a
clear
golden
brown
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
ringlet
and
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
not
really
a
deep
red
color
or
darker
amber
like
other
beers
of
the
style
light
aroma
of
toasted
malts
grains
caramel
the
taste
followed
the
aroma
lightly
toasted
malty
light
caramel
cereal
grains
light
body
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nothing
extraordinary
here
but
quite
sessionable
overall
12
oz
bottle
pours
copper
with
small
shortlived
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
of
bread
crust
herbal
hops
and
some
caramel
body
is
medium
and
crisp
herbal
earthy
hop
bready
malt
and
caramel
combine

i
would
not
buy
this
brew
again
12
oz
bottle
exp

april
poured
into
glass
head
on
the
beer
pours
with
a
slightly
tan
hue
the
color
is
a
deep
and
dark
red
and
clear
the
aroma
is
mild
but
roasted
malt
and
herbal
hop
is
present
the
first
taste
is
a
balance
between
malt
and
hop
with
a
significant
roasted
finish
the
beer
coats
the
palate
but
finishes
quite
dry
certainly
different
than
most
red
ales
but
for
an
irish
red
seems
appropriate
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
a
hoopy
irish
red
is
not
what
i
want
in
the
spring
nor
is
a
kind
of
heavy
and
sticky
bodymouthfeel
what
i
want
when
the
weather
is
getting
nice
i
wouldnt
choose
this
at
anytime
of
the
year
id
rather
newport
storm
bring
back
the
summer
ipa
and
replace
this
beer
with
that
od
not
the
best
irish
red
but
a
good
example
and
worth
giving
it
a
shot
at
least
on
tap
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
really
like
this
and
i
would
seek
it
out
again
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
but
very
bold
overall
thanks
shogo
smooth
creamy
coffee
taste
a
little
more
bitteracidic
than
it
was
fresh
but
still
good
we
drank
a
ton
of
these
on
trivia
night
it
may
have
been
the
gf
favorite
newport
storm
beer
and
i
believe
it
to
be
another
solid
offering
from
a
solid
brewery
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
style
which
i
thoroughly
enjoy
when
done
properly
yeah
spring
is
nearly
upon
usat
least
in
the
beer
world
though
it
doesnt
just
revolve
around
march
17th
so
we
look
past
the
style
connection
here
firm
pour
provides
a
tall
head
and
lengthy
lacing
red
knocks
on
blacks
door
in
a
chestnut
manner
hints
of
roasted
malt
mild
sweetness
and
a
faint
suggestion
of
licorice
root
sultry
smoothness
on
a
medium
body
toasty
goodness
that
lands
dry
then
roasted
flavors
kick
in
moderate
hopping
with
some
lingering
herbal
woody
flavors
palate
drys
up
really
quick
with
a
second
kiss
of
the
roasted
grain
a
sessionable
ale
for
sure
sadly
a
seasonal
only
there
is
no
need
to
have
a
boiled
dinner
just
once
a
year
when
you
can
have
it
whenever
you
want
ordered
a
bottle
while
having
some
pizza
at
a
restaurant
with
my
family
in
providence
poured
into
a
pint
glass
very
dark
red
color
bordering
on
brown
smell
was
of
faint
coffee
grounds
flavor
was
very
interesting
for
a
spring
ale
a
lot
of
chocolate
malt
here
gives
this
beer
a
cocoacoffee
flavor
like
a
porter
but
it
has
the
maltiness
of
a
red
ale
a
unique
take
on
the
flavor
profile
for
the
style
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
combined
with
a
smooth
body
made
it
easy
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
liked
the
fact
this
is
marketed
as
more
of
a
cool
weather
spring
beer
which
would
be
a
nice
time
to
enjoy
this
hearty
but
mild
ale
overall
a
decent
brew
havent
had
many
of
the
style
but
this
is
the
best
so
far
i
like
their
intended
purpose
of
creating
a
seasonal
for
the
colder
early
months
of
spring
in
new
england
it
works
well
because
with
the
roasted
malt
and
smoky
flavor
this
isnt
the
first
thing
id
go
for
in
warmer
weather
i
would
hardly
call
this
a
spring
ale
because
of
the
heavy
smokey
peaty
earthy
smell
and
taste
this
beer
has
its
not
refreshing
enough
to
be
a
spring
ale
and
not
heavy
enough
to
be
a
winter
ale
again
its
a
bit
heavy
to
be
an
irish
ale
but
not
heavy
enough
to
be
a
scotch
ale
i
feel
like
newport
storm
has
created
an
irishscotch
hybrid
thats
perfect
for
that
odd
transition
period
between
winter
and
spring
where
you
want
something
light
and
refreshing
because
you
want
it
to
warm
but
you
know
deep
down
that
its
going
to
be
cold
for
another
6
weeks
o
sessionable
cheap
easy
drinkin
could
be
tightened
up
a
bit
but
its
one
ill
buy
every
year
there
is
a
strange
taste
hanging
around
that
i
would
like
gone
but
it
isnt
very
strong
though
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
there
is
something
about
this
one
i
cant
put
a
finger
on
which
hurts
the
drinkability
and
we
finally
welcome
rhode
island
into
the
fold
this
offering
therefrom
pours
a
clear
dark
browngarnet
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
ecru
froth
the
nose
is
heavy
on
the
maple
syrup
and
molasses
with
some
caramel
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
spruce
getting
used
to
the
pine
on
the
sidelines
so
this
is
an
irish
red
right
this
nose
borders
on
porter
or
even
fes
okay
the
taste
goes
down
similarly
though
the
molasses
is
definitely
more
muted
and
the
maple
syrup
is
lighter
a
nicely
strong
contingent
of
piney
hops
makes
itself
known
trying
its
best
to
balance
out
the
portery
bits
the
hops
do
succeed
at
least
in
part
but
not
enough
to
fully
salvage
things
the
body
is
a
somewhat
hefty
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
crispy
feel
not
very
chewy
but
not
really
notchewy
either
overall
a
confusing
entry
not
bad
really
but
not
the
first
irish
red
id
reach
for
the
taste
has
elements
of
bitter
cocoa
neutral
body
with
a
low
carbonation
the
swallow
brings
out
some
hop
but
this
is
the
tale
of
the
malt
no
sweetness
here
this
is
has
lipsmacking
dryness
to
it
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
spot
of
black
patent
in
the
malt
mix
d
definitely
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
night
quite
easily
nice
beer
well
crafted
i
would
like
to
have
this
on
tap
at
some
point
thanks
john
d
found
this
to
be
be
refreshingly
drinkable
generously
flavored
and
appropriately
sessionable
not
a
wow
beer
but
doesnt
need
to
be
nice
one
by
cebc
one
id
have
again
the
taste
is
first
rate
and
i
appreciated
the
medium
body
of
the
beer
the
full
palate
of
flavor
and
the
modest
carbonation
this
is
a
really
good
red
ale
the
taste
begins
with
lots
of
roasted
caramel
malts
there
are
some
brown
sugar
residuals
in
the
background
the
beer
has
the
slightly
smokey
slightly
nutty
a
touch
caramely
crystal
malt
backbone
there
is
lots
of
creamy
goodness
in
this
beer
the
beer
isnt
particularly
sweet
but
it
doesnt
have
that
charred
over
burntness
characteristic
of
the
style
there
might
be
a
slight
hint
of
cherry
floral
in
this
beer
as
well
this
is
a
substantial
beer
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
a
good
aftertaste
that
lets
you
know
youve
had
something
important
but
without
the
burned
over
straw
flavors
that
all
too
many
reds
are
guilty
of
lchaim
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
coffee
note
and
caramel
the
taste
is
bitter
malty
with
some
coffee
notes
and
some
caramel
medium
body
drinkable
a
slightly
different
take
on
a
irish
red
ale
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
drinkability
not
bad
this
isnt
a
brew
that
id
session
on
as
i
find
it
a
little
bit
too
sweet
overall
great
head
retention
and
good
lacing
though
a
very
unique
tasting
irish
red
plenty
of
malty
nutty
aftertaste
drinks
very
smooth
could
have
planty
of
these
on
st
pats
day
i
will
want
to
try
some
more
offerings
from
coastal
brewing
thanks
themaniacalone
for
the
opportunity
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
nice
half
inch
head
smell
is
mainly
malt
with
some
molasses
undertones
taste
is
sweet
malty
and
wellrounded
mouthfeel
is
creamy
yet
with
a
nice
slightly
bitter
finish
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
definitely
could
have
more
than
one
pours
a
deep
clear
ruby
red
with
a
solid
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
shows
really
good
retention
lacing
is
minimal
i
honestly
couldnt
get
much
aroma
out
of
this
one
there
was
some
faint
light
malt
smells
with
a
hint
of
berries
the
taste
starts
with
the
sweet
caramel
malts
with
a
heavy
dose
of
sugar
as
well
unlike
the
smell
there
is
a
definitive
hop
presence
with
some
citrus
and
pine
that
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
malts
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
with
some
decent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
red
and
i
really
like
the
unique
hop
profile
that
shows
up
the
taste
i
dont
typically
think
of
hops
when
i
think
of
an
irishred
but
i
definitely
think
this
beer
is
better
for
their
presence
the
hops
might
be
a
bit
distracting
if
there
was
not
such
a
large
malt
presence
but
luckily
there
is
and
i
really
like
how
rich
the
malt
character
is
despite
this
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
a
clean
beer
that
drinks
much
better
than
i
might
have
guessed
now
this
brew
has
had
an
official
name
change
to
the
newport
storm
spring
ale
it
certainly
has
not
lost
any
of
its
flavor
or
appeal
this
is
still
a
solid
session
beer
in
my
opinion
poured
a
dark
amber
color
nice
ruby
tones
come
out
when
this
beer
is
back
lit
there
is
a
thin
white
head
that
left
a
mild
ring
of
lace
in
the
pint
smell
is
nutty
with
some
hints
of
sweet
caramel
malt
slightly
mild
tones
of
roasted
barley
are
found
in
the
background
no
real
hop
presence
but
it
was
detected
in
the
after
taste
coastal
extreme
brewing
certainly
created
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
there
is
a
strong
overall
malt
flavor
with
a
slight
dry
hop
finish
nice
after
taste
left
on
the
tongue
good
medium
bodied
offering
i
have
grown
fond
of
i
have
always
liked
this
beer
and
it
is
still
the
solid
irish
red
ale
it
has
always
been
this
beer
creates
a
great
crossover
between
the
heavier
winter
brews
into
the
lighter
easier
drinking
summer
beers
making
it
a
decent
transition
brew
drinkability
was
an
ok
beer
light
drinking
beer
goes
down
fast
d
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
from
newport
storm
worth
a
try
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
would
prefer
to
drink
while
eating
rather
than
just
drinking
it
alone
simply
because
i
prefer
a
more
flavorful
beer
if
im
drinking
it
by
itself
a
good
beer
though
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
decent
beer
to
be
had
the
smell
is
a
little
odd
but
overall
its
not
too
bad
i
thought
it
was
a
well
balanced
rather
drinkable
beer
that
would
go
well
with
anything
grilled
dark
reddish
copper
colored
with
foamy
white
head
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
some
faint
floral
hops
in
the
background
tastes
rather
bland
a
bit
sweet
with
a
hop
overtone
bitter
aftertaste
not
bad
but
nothing
special
certainly
wouldnt
have
another
overall
a
pretty
average
ale
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
seek
this
out
its
drinkable
though
this
red
ale
pours
a
dark
amber
color
closer
to
brown
than
to
red
it
leaves
a
very
thin
white
lace
that
disappates
quickly
appearance
is
clear
smoothe
looking
the
aroma
is
faint
i
had
to
stick
my
nose
deeply
in
the
glass
what
i
could
smell
besides
the
alcohal
was
a
nutty
maybe
roasted
essence
as
i
put
it
on
my
palate
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
i
detected
tastes
of
caramel
nuts
and
a
little
peppery
lemon
overall
decent
ira
i
recommend
it
but
not
one
of
the
better
beers
from
coastal
very
good
drinkability
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
well
i
guess
i
can
disregard
my
prior
review
now
that
it
is
brewed
at
a
different
brewery
drier
a
less
likable
graininess
and
a
worse
mouthfeel
this
beer
has
very
little
life
left
in
it
very
sad
as
it
used
to
be
a
beauty
is
it
the
pasteurization
something
is
lacking
in
the
finish
that
makes
it
dead
the
aroma
is
still
great
but
other
than
that
it
is
just
a
decent
red
ale
sigh
drinkability
is
average
good
be
better
and
im
sure
it
is
on
draught
but
in
the
bottle
this
one
is
a
relative
yawner
an
average
tasting
red
that
would
be
a
lot
smoother
and
drinkable
on
draught
another
coastal
extreme
that
i
probably
wont
be
going
back
to
this
is
a
well
balanced
nicely
flavored
amber
ale
thats
very
drinkable
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
with
a
one
finger
barely
offwhite
head
aroma
is
bready
and
grainy
with
just
a
wiff
of
some
spice
notes
from
the
hops
taste
follows
fairly
assertive
grainy
malts
with
just
enough
hops
to
dry
this
out
a
bit
nice
subtle
hopping
in
this
mouthfeel
is
nice
maybe
a
touch
low
on
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
a
good
candidate
for
a
session
beer
would
buy
this
again
especially
if
having
some
people
over
who
were
not
hopheads
but
liked
a
good
solid
beer
pours
a
twofingered
cream
head
that
fades

a
rough
pour
brings
up
a
marvelously
creamy
ivory
head
over
its
deep
copper
body
the
head
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
nice
craggy
lines
about
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
clean
and
inviting
with
just
a
hint
of
malt
and
some
subtle
yeasty
fruitiness
its
medium
body
and
median
carbonation
leave
it
lightly
crisp
and
then
smooth
across
the
palate
mild
carameltinged
malt
is
well
balanced
in
the
flavor
with
a
touch
of
floral
hops
and
a
firm
bitterness
some
yeasty
fruitiness
also
enters
and
gives
it
a
little
bit
more
character
it
finishes
clean
dry
and
refreshing
its
a
basic
wellmade
beer
that
represents
the
style
well
and
could
easily
serve
as
a
decent
session
ale
or
party
beer
its
accessible
to
the
masses
but
still
has
enough
going
on
to
satisfy
the
beer
lover

dense

above
the
clear
dark
amberlight
copper
brew
laces
well
aroma
consists
mainly
of
malts
with
a
bit
of
yeasty
highlights
taste
has
a
quick
grain
flavor
up
front
kind
of
bready
and
then
switches
to
a
somewhat
biting
hops
flavor
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
reasonable
ok
red
but
seems
to
be
missing
that
certain
something
to
make
me
come
back
for
more
be
a
deeper
malt
profile
more
pronounced
hops
something
pours
a
red
color
with
an
offwhite
full
headskie
the
flavor
balance
works
for
the
most
part
hops
are
a
bit
scratchy
but
do
the
balancing
job
ok
by
putting
the
sweetness
into
the
background
there
is
a
strange
taste
hanging
around
that
i
would
like
gone
but
it
isnt
very
strong
though
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
there
is
something
about
this
one
i
cant
put
a
finger
on
which
hurts
the
drinkability
thunderhead
irish
red
is
a
pretty
good
irish
red
ale
all
things
considered
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
but
is
an
enjoyable
enough
version
thanks
to
xgrigorix
for
the
bottle
caramel
toasty
malt
a
hint
of
apple
a
tiny
bit
of
chocolate
some
earthy
floral
hops
lead
to
a
crisp
finish
a
slightly
sour
mineraly
twang
lingers
for
a
short
time
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
a
thin
head
resulted
from
the
pour
and
a
lace
formed
that
would
not
quite
go
away
the
beer
was
a
dark
amber
or
red
in
color
the
taste
was
very
flatboth
the
carbonation
and
the
flavor
it
was
also
very
sweet
i
have
not
had
it
in
a
while
and
do
not
remember
it
being
this
sweet
overall
the
beer
was
blegh
not
remarkable
but
workable
in
a
pinch
this
beer
has
a
dark
amber
body
with
reddish
overtones
the
aroma
has
a
light
malty
sweetness
to
it
i
got
the
nice
malty
sweetness
at
the
begining
of
the
taste
followed
by
a
good
even
bitterness
and
finished
lightly
with
that
malt
characteristic
i
found
this
a
even
balanced
ale
with
very
good
easy
drinking
character
i
think
storms
take
on
an
irish
red
is
what
i
would
look
to
make
if
i
made
one
only
a
bit
more
on
the
roasted
side
than
i
would
do
the
spring
storm
of
the
season
is
a
nice
transition
to
wean
away
from
the
tasty
porter
that
is
available
in
the
winter
flavor
is
initially
very
mild
malty
with
a
somewhat
overpowering
yeasty
breadiness
slight
toasted
malt
presence
i
think
the
beer
was
a
little
too
warm
when
i
drank
it
not
the
best
red
ale
ive
had
fairly
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
its
ok
but
i
think
these
boys
can
do
better
less
on
the
breadiness
and
more
estery
flavors
apparently
this
is
newport
storms
spring
seasonal
as
i
found
it
in
bottles
on
cape
cod
last
month
irish
red
ales
are
not
necessarily
my
favorite
type
of
beer
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
6pack
of
this
one
very
enticing
reddish
color
with
a
lasting
creamy
head
roasted
malty
nose
and
strong
malty
taste
long
finish
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
no
freshness
dating
on
bottle
but
definitely
tasted
fresh
even
though
the
spring
season
was
coming
to
an
end
ill
again
be
a
customer
when
this
product
reappears
next
spring
not
as
much
malt
as
id
expect
from
an
irish
ale
sweet
though
but
simple
some
fruitiness
and
a
corny
sweetness
comes
through
later
on
the
palate
light
in
body
and
texture
but
not
without
its
charms
a
tasty
little
delight
but
i
wonder
what
else
these
guys
can
do
thanks
go
to

light

color
with
an
ample
sized
off
white
head
that
leaves
a
web
of

aroma
is
nutty
and
not
much
else
the
strong
roasted
flavors
surprised
me
at
first
but
grew
on
me
fast
a
creamy
and
clean
mouthfeel
made
this
brew
quite
drinkable

happiness
just
right
had
a

easily
had
a

more
this
is
a
good
old
session
beer
that
can
blend
well
with
any
food
in
the
case
of
this
tasting
i
paired
this
beer
with
some
hot
wings
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
seems
to
be
an
average
representation
of
the
style

kept
going
back
to

it
was
so
easy
sipping
and
after
a
big
plate
of
corned
beef
and
cabbage
it
was
still
sippable

quite
dry

more

i
probably
would
not
buy
this

this
was
one
of
the
better
versions
of
one
of
my
least
favorite
beer
styles
one
bottle
was
enough
for
me
it
could
have
been
much
worse
overall
not
too
bad
good
session
beer
also
have
to
not
this
beer
isnt
too
fresh
which
would
explain
some
of

a
touch

bad
but
a

subdued
feels
medium

and
overall
is
a
drinkable

pretty
good

o
just
an

irish

so
do
not
go
out

your
way

how
i
feel
about

the

is
a
bit
much
for

not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
overall
it

alright
in
the

were
it
not
for
the
prickly
nature
of
the
carbonation
overall
just
about
what
youd
expect
from
an
irish
red
quite
full
of
flavor
but
not
in
your
face
this
is
a
very
easytogulp
red
ale
bring
me
some
fried
clams
and
scallops
please
yeah
that
sounds
good
pulled
a
pint
of
this
at
a
burger
joint
in
west
hartford
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
with
a
dark
maroon
color
this
looks
ok
the
head
dissipates
to
a
few
clingy
spots
on
the
edges
smells
of
sweet
carmel
with
a
hint
of
grassy
earthiness
tastes
initially
sweet
and
carmel
which
transitions
to
a
clean
slightly
bitter
finish
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
think
a
bmc
person
could
get
into
this
one
quite
easily
not
a
wow
beer
but
not
bad
either
sour
malt
flavor
that
is
almost
as
if
a
malt
vinegar
was
added
light
hop
that
shows
up
in
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
cant
save
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
minimal
cap
of
off
white
head
decent
lacing
scent
brings
sweet
notes
of
brown
sugar
burnt
carmel
and
some
grassy
and
roast
qualities
first
taste
brings
the
brown
sugar
and
dark
carmel
sweetness
with
a
roasted
nut
quality
grassy
flavors
as
well
as
some
earthy
and
smoke
fuller

and
coating
perfect
like
carbonation
a
nice
irish
red
which
contains
some
bold
flavors
without
being
overly
sweet
moderate
carbonation
a
little
heavy
feeling
drinkability
is
below
average
since
its
a
little
too
sweet
drinkability
a
highly
flavorful
and
enjoyable
brew
id
gladly
have
this
again
d
moderately
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
really
care
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
very
boring
and
cheap
tasting
from
a
pretty
decent
brewery
dammit
i
hate
admitting
that
i
dont
remember
who
i
got
bottles
from
thanks
go
out
to
either
jlindros
or
gogriz
for
this
guy
though
both
deserve
plenty
o
thanks
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
ruby
amber
topped
by
about
a
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
rye
bread
maple
syrup
and
brown
sugar
the
taste
follows
emphasizing
the
sweeter
notes
like
maple
syrup
brown
sugar
and
plenty
o
toffee
a
slightly
sharp
bit
o
sourdough
creeps
in
there
near
the
end
as
well
and
this
somehow
does
not
detract
the
body
is
a
nice
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pretty
smooth
feel
overall
not
a
bad
red
at
all
nice
and
straightforward
d
a
decent
irish
red
but
not
a
standout
best
red
ale
ive
had
yet
could
just
keep
drinking
this
lush
and
delicious
beer
poured
a
deep
red
nearbrown
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
less
than
a
finger
of
head
spotty
lacing
and
mild
carbonation
the
smell
was
dominated
by
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
caramel
the
taste
was
a
little
more
balanced
between
malt
caramel
and
toffee
but
still
fairly
onedimensional
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
less
carbonation
then
expected
sessionable
yes
if
you
love
malty
flavor
in
excess
but
this
beer
was
too
onedimensional
for
me
d
average
not
a
beer
tasty
enough
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
light
enough
the
taste
of
this
irish
red
from
thomas
hooker
is
very
enjoyable
it
has
some
carmel
more
of
the
malts
and
hops
as
well
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sharp
compared
to
other
red
ales
but
pleasant
and
not
dry
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
good
in

thanks
john
a
nice
deep
burnt
red
with
a
creamy
off
white
foamy
cap
nose
is
very
malt
forward
lots
of
nutty
and
tofee
notes
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
molasses
some
dark
fruit
sweet
earthy
nutty
malts
with
good
caramel
backbone
a
bit
of
sharp
hops
tries
to
balance
the
swetness
but
it
doesnt
work
a
bit
too
sweet
but
the
flavours
are
good
for
the
most
part
creamy
and
overall
pretty
good
d
this
is
a
nicely
crafted
irish
red
very
drinkable
with
a
nice
malty
flavor
another
solid
offering
from
thomas
hooker
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
i
would
purchase
again
in
the
future
d
this
is
an
okay
irishstyle
red
ale
it
doesnt
blow
you
out
of
the
water
with
complexity
but
it
delivers
a
traditional
and
tasty
take
on
the
style
this
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
complex
it
is
not
the
beer
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
have
it
there
are
plenty
of
roasted
grains
a
slightly
charred
maltiness
that
interacts
with
the
drying
hop
to
take
away
the
beers
sweetness
the
slightly
ashy
flavor
is
the
predominant
flavor
throughout
there
is
a
cherried
maybe
a
slightly
honeyed
crystal
malt
flavor
underneath
but
it
cant
get
out
from
underneath
the
charred
and
ashy
flavors
the
beer
is
modestly
carbonated
reasonably
refreshing
has
a
touch
of
an
oiliness
in
the
mouthfeel
and
the
aftertaste
is
the
same
charred
notes
found
in
the
body
of
the
beer
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
given
the
abv
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
red
ale
d
despite
what
seems
to
be
a
low
score
i
could
drink
this
all
day
not
a
beer
to
sit
and
pontificate
on
its
a
beer
to
drink
very
easy
to
drink
irish
red
id
gladly
reach
for
this
one
in
the
future
d
as
with
far
too
many
restaurants
my
beer
was
served
at
a
near
arctic
temp
at
near
freezing
this
beer
doesnt
display
a
lick
of
complexity
as
it
warms
the
flavors
grow
and
the
beer
becomes
more
interesting
a
pretty
good
take
on
the
style
its
more
daring
than
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
chain
restaurants
namesake
beer
the
aroma
is
malty
with
caramel
and
grassy
hops
the
appearance
is
deep
amber
with
a
small
but
nice
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
its
simple
but
quite
effective
the
palate
is
smooth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
am
just
not
in
love
with
it
pours
a
amberish
gold
a
nice
size
head
with
sticky
lacing
and
good
retention
smells
like
a
boquet
of
fruity
aroma
with
tinges
of
toffee
and
honey
taste
is
a
big
caramel
malt
profile
up
front
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
some
malt
spice
is
present
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
break
from
the
killians
style
and
a
bit
more
intuitive
a
good
beer
from
a
local
brewery

im
not
usually
the
biggest
fan
of
irish
red
ales
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
was
balanced
perfectly
and
was
great
for
the
cooler
weather
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
of
these
to
enjoy
d
this
is
an
excellent
brew
that
hits
on
the
maltier
sweeter
side
of
this
style
d
good
would
mind
drinking
more
and
more
of
these
great
session
beer
average
abv
not
overpowering
in
its
flavor
a
good
irish
red
like
a
better
killians
and
i
like
killians
for
a
cheaper
brew
d
no
problems
here
i
could
drink
at
least
six
of
these
in
a
row
thought
i
reviewed
this
a
couple
years
back
guess
not
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
color
with
a
great
creamy
head
good
retention
on
this
beer
smells
very
sweet
and
a
bit
floral
lots
of
candy
in
the
aroma
along
the
lines
of
tropical
fruit
mike
n
ikes
or
the
like
or
even
bubble
gum
tastes
of
of
sweet
malts
up
front
then
falls
off
to
a
very
thin
finish
with
a
small
herbal
hop
bite
but
nothing
significant
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
airy
not
overly
carbonated
slightly
dry
finish
i
guess
its
drinkable
but
id
go
for
another
red
ale
within
arms
reach
very
quickly
or
any
other
style
for
that
matter
i
had
this
on
tap
with
dinner
in
new
haven
the
beer
was
dark
red
and
a
little
hazy
or
maybe
just
strongly
translucent
with
a
strong
3finger
foam
the
smell
was
malty
some
biscuit
and
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
the
flavor
followed
through
with
the
malts
i
didnt
get
much
from
the
hops
except
maybe
a
little
tempering
of
the
sweetness
ive
never
counted
irish
reds
among
my
favorites
but
this
one
could
enter
the
upper
echelon
within
that
style
nothing
too
special
here
in
my
opinion
a
huge
malt
bomb
for
me
almost
no
detectable
hops
at
all
i
also
thought
it
suffered
from
a
lack
of
carbonation
which
hurt
the
drinkability
it
tasted
almost
like
an
exaggerated
killians
irish
red
to
me
which
is
a
beer
i
can
barely
drink
so
that
isnt
saying
much
hookers
other
offerings
are
better
pours
a
very
dark
rich
red
amber
color
little
head
with
very
little
lacing
smells
of
malts
very
sweet
hints
of
spices
taste
sweet
malty
but
not
overwhelming
almost
taste
like
candy
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
good
red
ale
i
would
recommend
it
dark
amber
colored
ale
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
mainly
caramel
taste
is
caramelcoffee
and
toasted
malt
this
is
a
winner
i
would
buy
and
recommend
the
brewery
on
my
bottle
says
troutbrook
brewingi
dont
know
who
bought
who
but
they
did
a
very
good
job
pours
a
very
dark
red
almost
caramel
color
rather
thin
head
but
decent
retention
not
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
smells
of
malt
caramel
and
mild
spice
i
expected
a
stronger
aroma
from
such
a
dark
red
ale
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
a
bit
carbonated
tastes
somewhat
sweet
and
just
enough
malt
but
not
overpowering
a
little
bitterness
lingers
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
quite
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
smooth
red
ale
pours
a
four
finger
cream
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
clear
mahogany
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
malty
nose
flavor
is
like
a
neutral
caramel
not
sweet
not
bitter

bottle
from

attleboro
ma
d
nice
sweet
drinkability
dit
is
good
but
it
is
not
my
style
i
could
drink
one
and
move
on
but
if
presented
as
my
only
option
to
have
a
few
it
would
not
be
a
bad
option
overall
very
good
brew
i
wish
i
had
more

you
like
irish
red
ales
youll
like
this
d
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
mild
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
and
quite
easy
would
have
liked
to
see
a
little
more
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
categories
even
for
an
irish
red
still
remains
a
nice
beer
and
worth
a
try
for
anyone
looking
for
a
good
beer
that
is
not
too
complicated
pours
a
dark
amber
brown
color
with
an
average
head
nothing
special
the
aroma
is
dissappointing
i
pick
up
some
doughy
bread
malt
not
much
else
the
taste
is
of
buttery
malt
light
caramel
or
toffee
no
real
hop
profile
detected
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
good
carbonation
the
finish
is
dry
and
astrigent
the
drinkability
is
fine
but
nothing
special
much
better
brews
out
there
d
easy
drinking
tasty
brew
an
excellent
beer
here
i
wish
i
had
more
than
just
this
one
bottle
straddles
scottish
and
irish
ale
varieties
a
bit
but
the
result
is
wonderful
a
nicelooking
redbrown
color
with
a
mediumsize
white
head
which
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
it
had
a
malt
and
sweet
fruit
aroma
malt
predominated
first
in
the
taste
followed
by
a
little
cherry
flavor
and
finishing
with
some
hop
bitterness
fairly
dry
and
fun
to
drink
id
think
twice
about
passing
on
the
hooker
12pack
from
now
on
particularly
if
it
was
the
one
which
included
the
hop

love

do
something
a
little
different

there
is
a
sweet

with
a

john
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
one
and
to
be
honest
it
has
been
a
while
since
a
red
ale
has
impressed
me
this
was
very
nicely
crafted
and
never
got
boring
and
dull
nice
palate
and
great
feel
this
was
defiantly
a
winner
and
i
am
sure
it
really
shines
when
on
tap
this
one
is
recommended
md
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
but
no
at
all
displeasing
i
havent
tried
many
irish
red
ales
but
i
can
tell
i
will
like
the
style
the
sweetness
and
the
balance
really
stand
out
to
me
and
really
enjoyed
the
first
one
and
wish
i
had
another
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
this
brew
is
copper
red
with
a
light
head
but
fair
lacing
not
much
to
smell
other
than
a
hint
of
skunkiness
tastes
of
wheat
and
a
very
mellow
malt
blended
in
nicely
its
mild
with
ok
carbonation
quite
drinkable
there
is
a
peppery
touch
with
a
light
apple
background
a
nice
tasting
red
very
passable
for
a
wide
variety
of
occasions
drink
responsibly
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
very
thin
cream
colored
head
slight
carbonation
the
aroma
had
some
floral
notes
and
a
lot
of
malt
went
down
very
smooth
with
sort
of
an
astringent
or
drying
type
effect
at
the
end
the
first
one
had
me
wantng
another
mdheavy
for
a
redbut
that
might
have
been
the
cask
no
carb
very
thick
and
rich
one
of
the
better
irish
reds
that
i
have
had
and
a
true
irish
red
at
that
d
quite
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
excellent
representation
of
style
decent
kick
this
is
yet
another
exemplary
brew
by
th
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
in
an
evening
there
is
a
nice
malty
flavor
up
front
with
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
bite
than
youd
expect
from
the
style
its
nothing
overwhelming
but
noticeable
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
overall
a
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
session
ale
from
thomas
hooker
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
a
nice
carbonation
level
this
is
a
decent
sessionable
red
ale
after
the
pour
there
was
a
decent
head
atop
this
mediumdark
colored
ale
slight
lace
left
on
the
glass
upon
settling
nose
picks
up
a
caramel
scent
subtle
malty
flavor
accented
with
a
biscuity
taste
while
its
not
a
head
turner
i
could
easily
spend
a
session
with
this
beer
it
has
a
full
malt
flavor
but
the
richness
of
the
mouth
presence
seems
to
dominate
the
experience
im
not
finding
the
combination
as
distracting
as
some
i
would
enjoy
this
one
as
a
session
beer
if
it
was
available
locally
the
beer
pours
a
dark
red
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
crystal
bisquit
and
special
roast
malts
its
sweet
with
caramel
malts
yet
dry
with
a
toasted
aroma
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
crisp
dry
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
hops
and
a
slight
bisquity
edge
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
something
with
this
much
malt
character
shouldnt
be
this
carbonated
this
is
a
damn
good
red
ale
its
got
excellent
aroma
and
malt
flavor
one
of
the
best
red
ales
ive
ever
had
its
got
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
fine
drinkability
but
its
not
one
that
will
lodge
in
my
memory
probably
great
for
a
party
where
people
are
just
tipping
back
the
brown
bottles
but
nothing
to
boast
about
this
is
a
rich
fullflavored
redale
but
its
a
bit
thick
and
tough
to
drink
it
drinks
like
a
stout
or
something
bigger
than
this
actually
is
dont
get
me
wrong
theres
a
nice
caramel
malt
flavor
with
a
splash
of
citrus
hops
but
its
too
much
imo
for
a
red
ale
i
like
the
flavor
and
complexity
but
dial
back
the
mouthfeel
pours
a
deep
garnet
with
a
nice
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
nice
tang
of
malt
in
the
aroma
with
a
hit
of
spicy
hops
at
the
end
and
an
underlying
yeastiness
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
was
struck
by
its
maltiness
but
now
that
i
review
it
i
detect
more
hops
and
more
of
a
balance
still
tangy
malt
upfront
but
medium
bitter
hops
throughout
fruity
maybe
faint
red
fruit
flavors
but
dry
fairly
light
but
clean
and
delicious
and
enough
malt
to
give
it
some
body
holds
your
interest
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
was
not
as
sweet
and
malty
as
i
thought
it
might
be
it
actually
had
a
pretty
decent
hop
profile
very
well
balanced
and
nice
beer
this
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
red
the
thin
head
doesnt
stick
around
to
long
or
lace
much
the
smell
is
all
malts
caramel
and
toasted
maltiness
very
little
hop
character
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
dominated
by
a
full
malty
taste
with
a
bit
sweet
but
not
overly
sweet
and
again
just
a
touch
of
hops
there
is
a
touch
of
a
metallic
flavor
as
well
but
the
finish
is
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
maybe
slightly
overcarbonated
as
well
the
drinkability
is
ok
this
a
decent
irish
red
and
is
a
lot
better
than
some
other
irish
reds
that
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
was
acidya
bit
of
a
watery
feellots
of
tartness
goes
down
good
could
drink
a
few
but
not
a
lot
tastemouthfeel
pronounced
but
not
overpowering
malty
flavor
dominates
subtle
hoppiness
peeks
through
overall
a
nicely
balanced
brew
crisp
dry
mouthfeel
as
a
newby
to
ct
i
am
glad
to
find
some
local
brews
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
will
pick
up
next
fall
and
drink
throughout
the
winter
also
my
bro
is
a
killians
drinker
so
maybe
this
will
be
that
transition
beer
d
a
nice
solid
irish
red
i
am
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
a
fine
sessionable
brew
should
go
good
with
food
too
another
quality
beer
from
troutbrook
its
quite
nice
rich
and
somewhat
complex
although
it
may
build
on
the
palate
after
one
of
two
however
its
certainly
worth
trying
a
very
nice
brew
a
very
nice
beer
to
pair
with
a
dish
of
colcannon
on
a
winters
day
wont
win
the
award
for
best
in
style
but
it
comes
close
and
is
worth
hunting
it
down
to
give
it
a
try
great
brew
from
a
solid
brewer
cheers
hooker
irish
red
ale
is
yet
another
quality
offering
from
one
of
the
east
coasts
finest
breweries
ill
have
to
check
my
reviews
but
there
cant
be
too
many
iras
that
ive
liked
more
thanks
to
nouseforotacon
for
the
bottle
amber
brown
in
color
with
a
head
that
doesnt
quit
lacing
remains
throughout
eye
candy
smell
is
mainly
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
below
the
surface
taste
is
likewise
a
tad
sweet
with
a
small
hop
taste
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
not
to
a
fault
very
easy
on
the
palate
because
of
its
smoothness
and
medium
body
this
is
a
very
easy
brew
to
drink
defintely
have
more
than
one
thanks
to
far333
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
drinkability

well
i
usually
drink
a
few
of
these
once
i
have
one
i
always
want
a
second
occasionally
sessioned
definitely
worth
a
try
folks
taste
and
drinkability
lived
up
to
its
appearance
not
outstanding
but
very
worthwhile
some
malty
caramel
undertones
noted
not
heavy
on
the
hops
but
pretty
much
a
good
solid
irish
red
what
killians
can
only
hope
to
be
i
would
definitely
buy
again
if
looking
for
a
drinkable
ale
with
good
taste
but
without
too
heavy
a
body
d
a
solid
drinking
red
ale
from
t
hookerseems
like
it
would
be
a
great
session
brew
especially
with
the
low
abv
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
hue
with
smallish
tighty
bubbled
head
that
is
the
color
of
almonds
the
aroma
is
faintly
of
hops
citrusy
american
and
slightly
grassy
this
is
an
irish
red
but
there
is
minimal
malt
aroma
and
is
a
clearly
americanized
interpretation
taste
is
tea
like
and
yes
biscuity
but
very
fleeting
theres
a
faint
dark
malt
note
but
that
all
fades
quickly
into
hops
pine
citrus
zest
hops
and
that
lingers
gentle
muted
malt
flavors
here
session
kind
of
beer
here
but
not
a
remarkable
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
bodied
and
fully
carbonated
thought
fine
for
style
its
not
helping
a
session
beer
for
certain
or
an
american
hopfocused
smitwicks
for
those
who
prefer
hops
to
malt
doesnt
this
contradict
the
style
thought
basically
its
half
irish
red
half
american
amber
it
probably
gets
high
ratings
as
it
leans
toward
hoppy
rather
than
malty
despite
that
not
being
part
of
the
traditional
style
so
it
gets
better
ratings
here
than
say
hibernian
which
is
american
but
true
to
style
i
prefer
other
versions
but
this
is
not
a
bad
brew
thought
not
a
very
special
one
either
from
a
16
ounce
swingtop
bottle
this
pours
very
dark
for
an
irish
red
with
subdued
dark
ruby
highlights
and
a
thick
head
that
leaves
a
very
substantial
ring
around
the
beer
the
nose
is
all
carapils
malt
with
slight
dusty
hops
underneath
on
the
tongue
those
sweet
caramel
malts
come
through
first
then
metallic
moderately
bitter
hops
that
mesh
together
and
balance
each
other
rather
well
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
at
the
mid
palate
and
a
flat
finish
overall
a
great
session
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
smooth
and
interesting
enough
and
perfect
adherence
to
style
yummy
and
satisfying
red
a
good
version
of
a
style
i
generally
dont
get
too
excited
about
d
moderate
may
be
too
bitter
for
some
could
use
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
it
otherwise
very
tasty
this
pours
a
dark
ruby
mahogany
with
a
smallish
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
is
light
with
only
a
little
malt
present
the
taste
is
stronger
than
i
expected
with
honey
sweet
malt
hops
and
some
alcohol
in
the
mix
the
mf
is
light
but
the
sweet
malt
clashes
with
the
bitter
hops
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
flavors
dont
quite
mix
right
this
one
was
pretty
good
its
easy
drinking
and
full
of
flavour
throughout
its
definitely
worth
your
time
if
you
prefer
this
style
to
lean
more
toward
the
malt
side
of
things
rather
than
toward
the
hops
the
initial
smell
was
mild
malt
and
hints
of
caramel
after
letting
the
beer
sit
for
a
few
minutes
the
aromas
intensified
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
and
tasted
of
strong
malt
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
was
replaced
by
a
suttle
biterness
overall
the
beer
had
a
good
balance
d
mild
seems
to
be
the
keyword
that
comes
to
mind
the
most
when
thinking
about
this
beer
perhaps
its
because
ive
been
drinking
intensely
hoppy
or
malty
brews
this
winter
and
this
was
a
sudden
departure
from
those
styles
solidly
built
and
fairly
enjoyable
but
lacking
any
truly
distinctive
qualities
to
relish
thomas
hookers
irish
red
is
quite
drinkable
as
such
but
nothing
outstanding
nice
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
pours
a
crystaline
red
that
looks
quite
good
tastes
of
malts
breads
yeasts
and
mild
bitterness
very
smooth
and
went
well
with
a
salad
its
nothing
special
but
its
better
than
most
reds
i
had
repeatedly
missed
this
ontap
for
nearly
four
years
finally
got
it
on
the
right
date
crystalline
dark
red
with
burnt
amber
highlights
really
thick
moderately
dense
head
that
held
well
a
solid
malt
and
caramel
on
the
nose
something
not
unlike
oat
bread
too
about
the
same
on
the
tongue
with
some
hop
balance
a
good
trigger
of
yeast
and
nice
thick
feeling
to
it
a
good
version
of
the
style
very
smooth
on
the
palate
and
quite
flavorful
on
cask
this
is
one
that
i
could
drink
all
night
malty
aroma
biscuity
with
hints
of
bread
crust
and
caramel
same
in
the
flavor
with
a
more
of
a
toasted
and
very
mildly
roasted
malt
character
balanced
hops
and
very
drinkable
nothing
earthshattering
but
rather
just
a
good
drinking
ale
this
was
a
bomber
we
received
at
the
last
ba
festival
thanks
pour
is
a
lovely
deep
garnet
and
there
is
still
a
14
inch
tan
head
even
20
minutes
after
hurray
i
enjoy
the
deep
malty
notes
that
remind
me
of
rich
brown
bread
tastewise
the
beer
delivers
mostly
malt
up
front
and
some
low
but
mouthwatering
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
appropriate
carbonation
very
well
balanced
brew
and
another
winner
from
this
brewery
the
beer
poured
a
dark
red
with
a
thick
head
that
receded
to
form
a
slight
film
on
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
was
all
malts
and
grassy
hops
the
flavor
was
sweet
malts
and
reminded
me
of
the
the
sugar
toasted
peanuts
i
used
to
eat
in
nyc
there
was
also
a
nice
grassy
hop
kick
to
the
back
end
of
the
flavor
the
beer
has
a
full
body
the
beer
is
quite
good
overall
but
i
think
it
could
be
a
little
boring
to
the
palate
after
a
couple
pints
a
clean
dark
brown
beer
with
some
ruby
highlights
has
a
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lace
there
is
a
good
assertive
roasted
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
in
the
background
the
flavor
starts
out
with
some
malt
sweetness
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
with
a
good
balance
of
bitterness
from
hops
and
the
roasted
malt
bitterness
with
the
roasted
malt
winning
on
the
finish
this
is
what
a
cask
ale
should
be
plenty
of
flavor
and
body
complex
with
out
being
over
done
mild
malt
flavor
with
just
enough
hops
to
give
this
ale
wounderful
balance
their
is
just
enough
malt
in
the
aftertaste
that
makes
me
want
more
good
job

a
fair
amout
of
maltiness
to
go
with
a
little

a
bit
of
smokiness
and
roastiness
to
the
taste
much
better
than
the
commercial

at
an
irish

to
have
been
improved

yeasty

cant
detect
much
in

more
to
the
malty
side
than
hoppy
side

mild
notes

sweet
chocolaty
malt
poured
from

bottle

yielded
hardly
any

nothing
remarkable
at

about

not
a

lots

it
a
go
if
your

from
the

unfortunatly
there
is
a
certain
something
in
there
that
gives
it
an
astringency
that
makes
the
after

unfavorable
almost
like
i
let

thin

thanks
silverx
for
the
opportunity
notes
this
beer
was
very
well
balanced
and
flavors
were
complimentary
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
delightfuly
simple
a
good
beer
from
buffalo
where
i
live
an
irish
style
drank
in
an
irish
city
i
could
drink
this
all
night
nothing
extraordinary
but
its
a
well
crafted
local
staple
definatly
a
nice

this

the

is
lightly
toasted

with
a
tiny
bit

the
taste
starts
off
with
some
slightly
smokey
sweet
toasted

that
gives
way
to
a
kick
of
hops
that
stay
through
to
the
finish
the
mouthfeel

watery
with

crisp
carbonation
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable

even
though
its

its
still
worth
snagging
if
you
can
find
it

drinkability
eh
its
just
an
average
red
at
best
did
the
brewery
tour
and
liked
this
one
fresh
from
the
tank
picked
up
a
6er
sample
at
the
store
poored
deep
copper
in
color
with
about
14
of
cream
colored
head
that
dissipated
quickly
but
had
bits
hang
on
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
that
left
nice
lacing
taste
isnt
quite
what
i
remember
but
i
was
drinking
it
straight
from
the
tank
they
were
bottling
the
next
day
so
typical
of
other
red
ales
ive
tried
very
easy
to
drink
and
may
have
to
go
straight
to
the
source
next
time
d
i
tried
this
based
on
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
from
the
niagra
falls
area
thanks
doug
and
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
this
is
a
nice
red
ale
with
tons
of
grainy
flavor
complemented
by
plenty
of
bold
sweetness
i
will
definitely
try
other
offerings
from
flying
bison
in
the
future
this
is
a
tasty
and
solid
brew
this
one
is
even
a
bit
past
what
would
probably
be
a
best
by
date
has
a
brewed
on
date
not
a
best
by
date
and
so
the
hops
have
mellowed
a
bit
but
it
still
drinks
very
well
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
ruby
highlights
thin
tan
head
has
little
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
smells
of
sweet
and
roasted

sweet

semicrisp
with

with
a
good

well
as
a

pours
very
dark
for
an
irish
red
with
dark
mahogany
highlights
and
little
head
or
carbonation
mostly
malty
smells
here
but
theres
a
slight
stony
or
sulphury
element
lurking
in
the
background
on
the
palate
juicy
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
a
roasted
character
balance
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
and
dryness
at
the
finish
but
only
a
bit
the
beer
is
rather
sweet
overall
mouthfeel
is
still
and
heavier
than
expected
due
to
the
low
carbonation
level
overall
this
is
a
pretty
delicious
irish
red
that
would
make
a
great
sessionish
ale
very
nice

blast
bitter

mouthfeel
was
very
good
with

was
also
enhanced
by
the
slight

drinkability
wish
i
had
a
fresh
bottle
to
see
what
this
beer
is
really
like
the
oxidation
aside
i
can
see
this
being
a
nice
irish
red
plenty
of
malty
sweetness
that
is
balanced
out
by
some
really
nice
citrusy
hops
to
round
things
out
a
decent
beer
all
around
and
one
a
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
or
buy
if
available
worth
seeking
out
if
fresh
flying
bison
made
another
good
one
with
this
effort
again
thanks
to
my
sister
for
picking
this
one
up
for
me
on
her
trip
out
east
drinkability
this
would
get
greater
marks
here
but
the
carbonation
is
becoming
overwhelming
all
around
a
good
solid
drinker
that
could
be
sessioned
this
one
isnt
half
bad
but
its
just
not
the
type
of
red
ale
i
prefer
its
good
stuff
all
around
but
im
more
of
a
hoppy
red
ale
fan
if
malt
is
more
your
thing
youll
enjoy
this
one
for
sure
worth
a
try
regardless
pours
a
rich
amber
hue
with
a
huge
khaki
colored
three

head
that
takes
a
very
long
time
to
die
down
to
a
good
layer
of
lacing

stickiness
is
great
holds
on
all
over

off
to

take
away
from
the
drinkability
because
of
the
strange
taste
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
an
enjoyable
beer
but
nothing
great
drinkability
nicely
drinkable
but
i
didnt
find
this
in
the
session
beer
of
red
ales
a
bit
too
malty
for
that
but
this
beer
is
worth
giving
it
a
try
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
this
beer
seems
like
it
probably
should
be
in
the
irish
red
ale
category
but
its
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
could
stick
with
for
an
evening
seems
that
the
carbonation
levels
on
these
flying
bison
brews
is
kind
of
out
of
whack
got
these
samples
off
my
bro
who
was
experiencing
the
same
effect
damn
drinkable
once
the
foam
settles
d
this
was
interesting
and
worth
a
try
quite
complex
taste
to
it
the
carbonation
gets
in
the
way
of
the
character
though
bottled
on
date
box
is
blank
im
pretty
sure
this
is
very
fresh
though
pours
dark
copper
into
my
nonic
with
a
modest
creamy
light
tan
head
caramelly
malt
aromas
with
a
nearly
butterscotch
character
but
not
quite
faint
floral
hop
scents
sweet
caramel
maltiness
up
front
on
the
palate
with
a
slightly
spicy
and
floral
hop
interlude
right
before
a
surprisingly
long
toasted
biscuit
finish
which
is
probably
my
favorite
aspect
of
this
beer
there
is
a
slight
melonpearkiwi
fruitiness
somewhere
around
the
middle
of
the
sip
but
overall
this
is
a
maltbased
irish
red
ale
light
body
moderate
sparkle
and
tactile
piquancy
this
is
nowhere
near
outstanding
but
it
is
a
damn
good
session
brew
downright
quaffable
flaship
beer
ahoy
overall
an
average
amber
that
displays
some
irish
red
flavors
the
dry
bready
malts
become
a
little
too
much
as
it
warms
mediumdark
reddishbrown
with
a
small
creamy
light
tan
head
that
slowly
diminishes
to
a
tenacious
film
some
shortlived
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
wonderful
full
and
malty
backed
by
a
mild
hops
presence
dark
bread
and
caramel
most
notable
along
with
a
hint
of
earthy
peat
the
taste
is
actually
a
bit
of
a
let
down
its
not
bad
but
following
such
and
attractive
nose
it
just
doesnt
live
up
to
expectations
it
starts
and
finishes
nicely
but
i
find
the
middle
pretty
dull
in
both
flavor
and
mouthfeel
it
has
a
medium
body
lightly
dry
texture
and
low
carbonation
it
definitely
has
a
lot
of
qualities
i
admire
but
it
needs
some
tweaking
to
make
it
something
id
recommend
seeking
out
a
medium
mouthfeelslightly
cloyinga
bit
grainy
a
nice
hop
swell
on
the
palate
a
very
good
beer
overallvery
pleasing
and
tasty
could
drink
the
one
all
nite
long
solid
beer
pours
a
medium
red
color
with
a
slight
white
foamy
head
smell
was
malty
with
hints
of
caramel
the
taste
matched
this
with
a
dry
finish
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
had
this
in
buffalo
for
thanksgiving
would
have
it
again
di
like
this
beerive
had
killians
irish
red
and
it
almost
taste
alike
ide
try
this
beer
again
but
not
anytime
soonthere
are
plenty
of
other
beers
out
there
that
i
wanna
try
more
good
though
pours
a
good
amberred
color
with
some
head
a
good
hearty
amber
that
still
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
nice
rich
caramel
malts
with
citrus
hops
to
match
reminds
me
of
rogues
amber
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
for
drinking
or
meals
cheers
appears
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a

toned

nice
full
bands
of

a
full
nutty

drinkability
is
a
solid
all
around
drinking
irish
red
that
goes
down
smooth
light
in
the
mouth
too
not
watery
at
all
not
too
heavy
at
all
would
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
drinkability
i
could
drink
about
a
six
pack
of
these
delicious
beers
before
it
gets
too
strong
pours
a
dark
brownred
when
held
to
light
the
red
really
comes
through
not
much
head
to
speak
of
and
no
lacing
left
behind
smells
of
sweet
malts
some
chocolate
and
dark
fruits
tastes
of
similar
but
not
as
rich
as
i
would
have
expected
good
drinking
beer
but
dont
have
to
worry
about
savoring
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
and
was
disappointed
drinkability
is
very
good
no
overpowering
flavors
and
is
not
too
complex
bought
a
full
6er
and
will
happily
finish
them
probably
wont
get
again
though
might
not
soar
like
an
f14
but
provides
a
nice
solid
workmanlike
flight
good
everyday
kind
of
beer
and
makes
a
fine
ale
substitute
for
an
octoberfest
the
beer
was
good
but
not
really
my
style
if
youre
in
to
irish
reds
id
give
this
a
try
d
this
is
a
beer
to
savor
for
its
complex
malt
flavors
the
intensity
and
quality
of
the
flavors
make
it
a
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
and
in
small
quantities
pours
reddish
brown
almost
reminds
me
of
motor
oil
the
label
says
its
a
red
ale
brewed
in
an
irish
tradition
but
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
nonbitter
stout
tastes
like
a
light
stout
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
i
would
call
this
an
enjoying
beer
rather
thick
and
creamy
hard
to
drink
quick
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
will
gladly
drink
again
d
worth
a
try
if
youre
a
amberred
ale
fan
good
interpretation
of
the
style
pretty
darn
good
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
if
the
opportunity
arose
i
had
this
on
cask
at
the
old
toad
in
rochester
ny
poured
a
nice
deep
red
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
thined
out
pretty
quickly
smell
was
malty
but
mild
with
little
hops
and
notes
of
carmel
very
tastely
brew
malty
smooth
and
true
to
the
style
definitly
something
id
get
again
cheers
taste
wise
this
beer
is
one
of
the
better
red
ales
i
have
tasted
i
liked
the
malt
flavor
and
the
hops
were
added
in
just
the
right
amount
to
complement
the
malt
flavor
overall
a
drinkable
amber
not
necessarily
my
first
choice
but
it
gets
the
job
done
a
nice
red
ale
but
was
expecting
more
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
it
is
very
malty
my
only
criticism
is
the
lack
of
hops
it
is
pretty
smooth
going
down
nice
and
fruitycaramelysweet
with
a
slight
chocolate
finish
there
is
no
bite
to
it
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
all
that
satisfying
poured
from
growler
into
an
american
pint
glass
not
too
much
head
lacing
remains
throughout
beer
has
a
nice
dark
brownish
red
color
not
as
red
as
most
red
ales
are
in
color
hoppy
aroma
smell
really
tells
you
whats
in
store
hops
is
the
dominating
flavor
but
not
too
hoppy
good
roasted
malt
aftertaste
very
clean
in
the
mouth
overall
a
nice
enjoyable
beer
i
didnt
hold
out
too
much
hope
after
a
few
strong
sniffs
but
the
engaging
flavor
was
a
nice
surprise
for
me
i
dont
mind
yeast
not
saying
that
but
it
just
came
on
a
bit
strong
at
first
but
the
flavor
more
than
mitigated
what
i
saw
as
the
sole
setback
this
is
probably
a
bit
more
complex
than
your
average
session
beer
but
with
the
manageable
abv
it
is
certainly
as
drinkable
as
many
others
if
not
more
so
buffalo
may
not
crank
out
a
lot
of
taste
sensations
but
you
can
add
this
one
to
the
distinguished
if
limited
list
just
had
the
aviator
red
during
a
black
friday
lunch
at
coopers
in
scranton
pa
i
know
scranton
but
it
is
a
very
good
beer
bar
the
beer
pours
a
nice
slightly
light
brown
color
with
a
nice
head
in
the
glass
i
can
pick
up
some
slightly
toasty
notes
to
this
one
nice
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
it
goes
down
the
malt
in
this
red
ale
is
a
nice
touch
and
makes
this
beer
a
good
one
to
have
a
few
of
without
a
problem
for
3
75
a
bottle
not
a
bad
deal
definitely
worth
a
try
what
ho
buffalo
beer
on
this
evening
of
session
drinking
this
puppy
fits
the
bill
get
it
bill
bills
no
ok
pours
a
deep
chestnut
colored
brew
im
picking
up
some
toffee
and
starbucks
coffee
in
the
nose
interesting
for
the
style
very
malty
profile
with
a
good
wallop
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
in
there
to
balance
the
malt
sweetness
hop
bitterness
is
subtle
but
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
mild
carbonation
chewy
and
coating
a
real
nice
drinker
certainly
not
wide
right
closer
to
down
the
middle
overall
this
is
a
fairly
basic
but
still
very
good
beer
that
would
work
well
in
a
wide
variety
of
situations
and
pair
with
a
decent
range
of
basic
foods
beer
is
good
happy
local
treat
beering
a
solid
offering
from
flying
bison
appears
about
what
you
expect
from
a
red
ale
but
a
little
nicer
nice
vibrant
ruby
red
color
with
a
nice
head
good
retention
wow
smell
is
great
really
strong
coffee
or
espresso
bean
character
pops
right
out
at
you
interesting
and
a
little
bold
for
a
red
ale
also
a
nice
mixture
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
scent
balance
is
key
taste
is
equally
good
the
mentioned
espresso
taste
is
more
subtle
in
the
taste
nice
big
carmel
malt
notes
up
front
with
a
nice
milky
creamy
taste
this
is
a
solid
beer
all
around
excellent
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
to
big
bodied
great
complexity
without
being
too
much
this
red
ale
is
a
bit
bigger
and
bolder
than
most
a
great
interpretation
of
the
style
one
of
my
favs
when
theyre
good
a
great
first
experience
with
flying
bison
i
have
to
seek
out
some
more
strong
coffee
malts
with
a
tiny
touch
of
chocolate
nice
and
smooth
as
it
warms
exceptionally
so
ruby
brown
with
not
much
of
a
head
hardly
any
carbonation
the
alchohol
overpowers
the
otherwise
ok
malty
earthy
smell
coffee
sneaks
out
from
the
alchohol
very
heady
coffee
maltsat
first
but
dies
out
quickly
a
bit
watery
a
touch
of
alchohol
a
touch
of
chocolate
very
smooth
but
a
bit
thin
drinkable
easy
and
smooth
this
is
a
better
beer
for
the
fall
or
winter
seasons
drinkable
yes
very
much
so
in
fact
i
could
sit
back
and
kill
a
sixpack
of
this
hell
i
might
kill
to
try
this
beer
on
cask
if
this
beer
were
a
local
i
would
drink
it
often
as
is
i
need
to
thank
shippos
for
including
this
bottle
in
the
secret
bunny
exchange
mildly
sweet

to
a
thin
film
transparent
deep
brown
colored
beer
with
an
amber
hue
toasted
biscuit
malt
flavor
up
front
mixes
midway
with
a
bit
of
hop
tea
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
light
bodied
beer
with
a
soft
mouthfeel
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
and
strange
up
front
but
otherwise
a
nice
beer
a
dark
juicy
looking
red
colour
with
a
nice
ample
head
of
white
foam
aromas
are
of
juicy
fruity
hops
caramel
malts
bread
and
pine
the
taste
is
very
juicy
with
a
subtle
hop
flavor
that
is
very
juicy
in
nature
the
maltiness
is
apparent
but
somewhat
subdued
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
refreshing
which
gives
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
a
very
clear
edge
this
was
a
cheap
single
a
lastminute
grab
while
leaving
the
beer
store
i
didnt
expect
much
to
be
sure
but
found
a
hell
of
a
good
brew
its
a
dark
amber
nearly
reddishbrown
brew
with
a
beautiful
longlasting
head
its
really
an
attractive
beer
the
aroma
is
intense
and
of
roasted
malts
and
alcohol
chocolate
bit
of
coffee
and
somewhat
peppery
at
times
theres
an
intrusive
harshness
but
i
found
that
kind
of
enjoyable
only
slightly
sweet
and
very
well
balanced
medium
body
and
very
smooth
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
see
why
this
one
has
a
higher
score
than
say
the
casco
bay
riptide
its
much
smoother
nicer
to
drink
well
especially
if
its
not
hot
out
and
when
is
it
hot
in
maine
if
they
cut
back
on
the
chocolate
malts
and
maybe
upped
the
hops
a
bit
this
would
be
an
awesome
beer
ruby
red
hue
thick
pure
white
head
nose
is
pleasant

some
fresh
baked
bread
dark
roasted
malts
thin
bodied
but
not
in
the
way
of
flavorings
some
coffeeespresso
notes
dark
roasted
malts
rather
dry
vienna
malts
come
to
play
rather
over
carbonated
minimal
hop
presence
nonoffensive
but
average
at
best
freshness
may
be
an
issue
here
the
beer
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
kick
ass
malty
scent
it
is
complex
and
full
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
it
has
a
dry
feel
and
a
creamy
finish
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
yet
malty
flavor
with
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
in
the
aftertaste
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
red
ale
it
has
great
aroma
and
complexity
an
awesome
brew
from
buffalos
finest
now
the
first
bottle
i
had
was
awesome
but
the
second
seemed
a
little
off
and
had
some
chunks
of
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
so
this
beer
might
vary
a
little
due
to
qc
still
give
this
beer
a
shot
a
very
good
drink
but
the
heaviness
definitely
becomes
a
factor
in
terms
of
drinkability
a
great
version
of
the
style
and
one
to
seek
out
of
your
partial
to
reds

oddly
enough
says
gringo
light
too
cryptic
for
me
to
decipher

robust

it
becomes

chocolate
toasted

with
some
coffee
on
the
aftertaste
with
a
minimum
appearance
of
hops
although
the
hops
become
a
bit
more
prevalent
as
the
glass
warms
up
light
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
carbonation
on
the
finish
a
very
rich
red
ale
it
could
have
easily
fooled
me
for
a
brown
it
could
use
a
stronger
dose
of
hopping
for
my
tastes
so
as
not
to
be
so
overhwhelmed
by
the
plethora
of
malts
many
thanks
to
northyorksammy
for
the
fresh
sample
nice
ruby
red
and
beautiful
creamy
head
various
flavour
including
chocolate
malt
and
a
total
of
5
malts
this
is
a
standout
red
rogue
red
rocket
red
seal
etc
are
all
too
hopped
up
to
be
a
red
should
be
considered
a
india
red
as
landmark
has
properly
done
regardless
i
would
purchase
aviator
over
all
of
these
even
without
the
homestate
nod
a
real
nice
offering
from
a
small
brewery
in
buffalo
and
am
very
glad
i
found
it
pours
a
great
deep
red
with
a
creamy
sticky
a
real
pleasure
to
look
ataroma
was
all
malttoasted
malt
and
biscuity
taste
was
also
very
toasty
with
nice
sweetness
a
nice
toasted
malt
aftertaste
made
this
a
real
winner
normaly
i
cant
drink
to
many
reds
but
i
was
able
to
have
a
few
of
these
with
easea
very
nice
beer
i
may
be
partial
to
a
hometown
brewery
but
the
overwhelming
freshness
of
this
makes
it
ohsogood
very
easydrinking
and
smooth
nothing
too
exciting
but
definitely
enjoyable
not
a
really
good
effort
from
glb
the
soapy
finish
is
off
putting
very
smooth
excellent
flavor
especially
good
when
on
draught
this
is
a
subpar
beer
in
my
opinion
perhaps
its
just
the
style
but
this
one
wasnt
doing
it
for
me
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
i
have
had
in
this
style
and
one
of
the
few
that
i
would
drink
outside
of
march
if
it
were
available
nice
clean
lager
with
a
taste
of
caramel
toasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
woodsy
hops
at
the
end
super
malty
super
sessionable

in
the

nothing
groundbreaking
here
but
a
solid
ale
for
anyone
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
the
focus
on
the
malt
nice

slight

taste
which
is
good
this
is
the
only
great

i
have
liked
it
was
sample

9
so
that
may
have
been
the
only
reason
i
liked
it
seasonal
favorite
always
excited
when
this
one
hits
the
taps
pleasantly
surprised

generally
not

a

great
for

done

this
is
another
one
you
need
to
let
warm
up
as
it
changes
the
taste
quite
a
bit
the
first
one
i
had
i
tried
it
while
it
was
still
too
cold
and
was
underimpressed
it
pours
with
a
red

appearance
with
a
nice

vigorous
pour
of

fingers
that
dissipates
quickly
to

i
would
certainly
pick
up
a
sixer
of

overall
slightly
sweeter

i
prefer
but
without

the

would
not

im
good
with

others
of

ive
had

this
is

overall
a
great
beer
by
any
means
however
i
did
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
other
great
lakes
brews
that
could
be
because
gl
couldnt
make
a
bad
beer
if
they
tried
im
not
a
huge
malt
fruitiness
fan
but
this
at

has
a
nice

support

sit
on
the
couch
on
a
sunday
and
drink
while
watching
a
few
games
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
fits
the
definition
of
an
irish
ale
similar
to
a
english
pale
ale
with
caramel
malts
not
chemicalnasty
or
flashy
just
a
good
ale
overall
this
just
seemed
like
an
underwhelming
irish
red
ale
it
certainly
was
not
bad
but
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
the
complexities
were
present
they
just
failed
to
balance
this
one
out
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
unfamiliar
with
this
style
my
favorite
irishred
ale
of
them
all
so
smooth
and
easydrinking
yes
i
am
quite
biased
in
favor
of
great
lakes
brewing
company
because
one
of
my
best
friends
worked
there
for
nine
years
and
ive
spent
many
a
fine
afternoonevening
at
the
place
but
my
preference
for
glbc
beer
is
primarily
because
the
beers
are
almost
always
outstanding
cheers
conways
irish
ale
is
good
the
label
is
awesome
great
lakes
is
probably
the
best
thing
to
come
out
of
cleveland
since
the
browns
left
for
baltimore
this
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
with
no
head
and
no
lace
the
scent
is
mostly
caramel
malt
with
biscuits
the
taste
is
nothing
remarkable
or
noteworthy
just
solid
it
is
well
balanced
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
so
so
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
sessionable
beer
and
worth
a
try
o
a
truly
underrated
ale
in
todays
craft
beer
world
a
real
hallmark
on
the
roots
of
glbc
and
what
they
are
about
this
irish
ale
gets
back
to
the
basics
of
crafting
exceptional
brews
and
with
the
kind
of
stuff
thats
being
created
in
the
u
s
right
now
we
sometimes
forget
these
simple
yet
brilliant
ales
this
is
reviewed
based
on
what
they
accomplished
with
the
idea
they
had
this
wasnt
intended
to
start
a
new
trend
or
be
an
insanely
flavored
giant
this
is
the
basics
of
brewing
and
done
perfectly
sometimes
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
a
9
abv
brew
to
get
a
high
rating
i
applaud
beer
like
this
done
right
this
is
a
little
underwhelming
for
great
lakes
but
overall
its
not
too
bad
easily
sessionable
3
55
one
of
my
first
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
it
a
bit
although
i
know
id
get
tired
of
it
after
one
bottle
much
like
i
did
this
time
around
the
intense
caramel
and
toffee
malts
are
nice
at
first
but
can
be
a
touch
overwhelming
after
twelve
ounces
tasty
brew
no
doubt
but
one
is
certainly
enough
for
me
overy
well
balanced
and
malty
great
example
of
the
style
i
dont
drink
many
red
ales
but
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
if
this
were
distributed
in
my
area
it
would
definitely
be
in
my
refrigerator
as
a
goto
beer
overall
drinking
this
i
went
back
and
forth
if
it
was
goodgreat
i
ended
up
at
great
its
near
the
end
of
its
freshness
20
days
away
so
i
want
to
try
it
fresh
next
year
but
this
beer
is
another
great
one
from
great
lakes
the
bottle
indicates
its
about
three
months
old
which
should
not
be
old
enough
to
lose
its
pop
the
flavors
are
good
but
i
feel
like
if
it
were
at
its
freshest
this
could
be
more
robust
o
a
great
beer
to
keep
you
on
your
toes
and
awaken
all
your
senses
overall
this
is
a
good
session
beer
a
little
to
tangy
for
my
tastes
the
sweetness
in
the
smell
does
not
come
through
in
the
taste
and
the
whole
thing
has
the
carbonation
level
of
soda
not
bad
but
this
could
be
better
this
isnt
too
bad
its
a
really
excellent
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
im
not
really
digging
the
slight
caramel
aspect
to
it
but
its
still
well
done
overall
not
my
favorite
from
great
lakes
actually
i
think
this
one
is
my
least
favorite
still
an
ok
beer
tho
o
a
good
beer
that
id
drink
again
this
one
may
have
suffered
from
sloppy
barkeeping
o
solid
but
not
a
standout
this
is
an
easy
drinking
if
not
very
challenging
irish
ale
minimal
amounts
of
that
mildly
fruity
and
leafy
thing
that
seems
prevalent
in
the
style
decent
enough
to
drink
though
not
overly
interesting
or
mind
blowing
i
hope
this
is
an
accurate
sample
of
this
beer
really
i
just
tried
it
because
it
was
one
of
the
great
lakes
beers
i
had
yet
to
check
out
next
pours
reddish
with
a
nice
head
i
rarely
drink
this
style
and
bought
because
of
the
date
malts
and
grain
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
malt
and
a
strong
hop
presents
overall
it
blends
nicely
medium
carbination
it
exceeded
what
i
thought
i
would
get
in
this
style
it
took
me
8
years
fo
find
this
beer
it
has
a
great
beer
smell
and
it
pour
nice
in
a
glass
its
not
red
maybe
dark
orange
goes
down
smooth
but
it
taste
like
im
swallowing
a
flower
big
disappoint
here
for
all
of
you
who
likes
good
for
you
but
i
cant
wait
for
there
other
wonderful
beers
overall
an
all
around
good
beer
i
can
dig
it
i
would
buy
this
one
again
always
a
fan
of
glbc
o
this
is
a
simple
well
made
beer
four
ingredients
that
are
finely
balanced
solid
quaffable
beer
one
of
the
better
for
the
style
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
for
folks
that
enjoy
the
malt
forward
style
i
do
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
beer
is
almost
sessionable
pairs
well
with
food
overall
a
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
which
ill
likely
buy
again
overall
as
should
be
of
no
surprise
this
is
another
good
brew
by
great
lakes
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
roasted
and
sweet
flavors
while
still
maintaining
great
drinkability
but
still
remaining
quite
proficient
in
flavor
pours
a
copperorange
color
with
a
fluffy
head
toasted
malt
and
nuts
aroma
gently
sweet
bready
slightly
fruity
tasty
malt
biscuit
toffee
graham
cracker
and
tea
flavors
medium
bodied
and
smooth
sort
of
chewy
and
dry
in
the
finish
an
enjoyable
and
easily
drinkable
take
on
a
style
that
is
oftentimes
pretty
boring
d
im
glad
glbc
took
this
style
and
made
it
bigger
a
style
that
could
definitely
use
the
meat
this
is
well
welcomed
lots
and
lots
of
caramel
flavors
and
aromas
if
you
are
a
fan
of
irish
reds
pick
this
up
o
a
pretty
solid
session
beer
to
enjoy
this
time
of
year
no
wow
factor
but
quite
enjoyable
glad
to
recommend
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
moderate
intensity
leading
to
a
mouthfeel
that
is
somewhat
fizzy
at
first
then
foamy
then
a
mix
of
creamy
and
slightly
watery
mouthfeels
closes
dry
with
moderate
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
overall
a
great
beer
for
those
who
love
the
lighter
yet
maltier
brews
great
lakes
makes
some
very
tasty
brews
and
this
one
fits
perfectly
in
their
family
just
another
solid
offering
from
great
lakes
price
point
8
596pk
12oz
bottles
this
is
a
rather
simplistic
beer
the
esters
from
the
yeast
provide
most
of
the
flavor
offering
some
fruitiness
the
malt
is
prevalent
but
it
really
only
adds
caramel
this
was
a
nice
beer
to
try
once
but
this
isnt
something
i
would
seek
out
again
id
have
this
again
while
i
wasnt
expecting
to
get
blown
away
by
this
beer
this
was
just
a
little
underwhelming
for
a
brewery
like
great
lakes
while
a
good
irish
red
keep
style
in
mind
and
very
much
sessionable
there
are
a
few
caveats
that
take
away
in
my
opinion
worth
checking
out
however
cm2013
overall
very
dirinkable
but
im
not
crazy
about
this
iteration
flavors
dont
melt
quite
right
for
me
not
bad
but
not
great
either
beautiful
amber
red
pour
inch
head
excellent
lacing
smells
of
caramel
and
malt
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
peppery
zest
mouthfeel
is
thick
wonderfully
balanced
and
very
smooth
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
the
flavor
profile
and
smell
is
somewhat
simple
though
its
very
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
zesty
finish
creamy
and
that
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
brew
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
with
a
good
white
head
leaving
a
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
pleasant
light
malt
the
taste
was
a
very
satisfying
bit
of
malt
with
a
peppery
finish
the
feel
is
medium
and
dry
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
it
is
well
put
togethet
and
could
easily
be
consumed
en
masse
overall
this
beer
is
exceptional
for
its
naturally
roasted
flavor
as
well
as
its
unpretentious
drinkability
o
6
5
abv
but
goes
down
like
a
good
4
5
session
beer
this
is
definitely
brewed
closer
to
style
than
fff
brian
boru
but
i
like
the
brian
boru
a
little
better
both
are
great
seek
em
o
another
winner
from
great
lakes
the
body
has
a
nice
reddish
color
body
with
a
small
head
that
lays
down
quickly
the
smell
has
a
nice
maltyness
to
it
the
taste
has
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
it
also
has
some
fruiteyness
to
it
also
the
mouth
feel
is
great
and
overall
a
really
good
easy
drinking
beer
o
i
dont
really
like
reds
so
this
was
a
big
surprise
well
done
glbc
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
fresh
and
easy
drinking
it
was
the
fruitiness
was
overbearing
at
first
and
was
still
quite
strange
by
the
end
but
the
balanced
through
the
middle
saved
it
it
was
nice
for
the
style
but
seemed
to
be
lacking
just
a
bit
in
every
category
o
a
good
irish
ale
although
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
the
sweetness
from
the
fruit
flavors
is
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
appears
a
fiery
orange
with
good
clarity
thick
dense
white
head
present
with
great
retention
and
tons
of
lacing
the
nose
features
a
light
earthy
hop
character
along
with
a
punch
of
malty
sweetness
the
taste
starts
malty
and
sweet
and
then
gives
way
to
a
tea
like
hop
bitterness
along
with
grass
and
herbs
the
taste
finishes
slightly
bland
the
body
is
moderate
and
the
carbonation
is
mellow
overall
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
character
but
the
flavors
dont
work
for
me
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
delicious
beer
from
great
lakes
ive
had
it
several
times
on
tap
and
would
recommend
it
this
is
a
very
solid
irish
red
ale
and
probably
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
that
ive
had
recently
this
was
well
balanced
and
flavorful
with
a
crisp
and
quenching
feel
to
it
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
flavor
is
primarily
sweet
toast
and
jam
with
some
caramel
notes
and
a
nice
mild
hop
presence
there
is
a
faint
touch
of
spice
nutmeg
mouthfeel
is
thintofirm
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
enjoyable
representation
of
the
style
that
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
again
i
do
wish
it
had
a
little
more
going
for
it
in
the
hop
department
though
the
taste
is
good
but
comes
off
very
smooth
and
lagerlike
at
times
with
a
slight
toasted
grain
character
and
mild
caramel
notes
intermingling
the
finish
has
an
almost
lagerlike
flavor
with
herbal
hops
enhancing
the
malt
but
leaving
a
slight
dry
effect
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
irish
red
i
wasnt
expecting
one
with
the
amount
of
alcohol
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
for
the
strength
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
most
i
have
had
of
the
style
o
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
and
i
usually
appreciate
breadiness
in
beers
but
this
one
tilts
the
scales
flavorwise
its
not
got
the
biggest
malt
backbone
to
carry
it
or
any
hoppiness
this
would
make
a
good
foodbeer
its
light
enough
to
be
swiggable
and
has
those
robust
toastinesses
that
i
think
could
ride
well
over
salty
greasy
stuff
not
for
me
though
o
another
winner
from
great
lakes
their
conways
is
my
favorite
irish
red
and
one
i
can
easily
recommend
to
those
looking
for
a
better
unique
alternative
to
smithwicks
a
nice
beer
for
those
cool
spring
nights
but
not
my
favorite
offering
from
great
lakes
this
beer
looks
very
nice
and
has
some
aroma
complexity
and
is
very
steady
on
taste
and
feel
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
on
draft
to
see
how
it
differs
o
i
had
this
one
after
a
brian
boru
and
the
two
just
dont
compare
this
one
is
much
more
malty
with
a
lots
of
fruit
which
i
wasnt
expecting
and
very
low
on
the
hops
and
bitterness
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
couldnt
see
coming
back
to
it
overall
not
the
best
irish
ale
however
i
do
think
it
is
worth
drinking
and
would
try
it
again
pours
completely
transparent
somewhere
between
amber
and
ruby
in
color
with
a
healthy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
mild
and
unobtrusive
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
first
sip
invokes
a
sweet
malty
lightly
spiced
flavor
with
a
very
smooth
feel
its
easy
for
caramel
malt
to
become
cloying
if
ones
not
careful
but
i
dont
find
that
to
be
the
case
here
theres
just
enough
citric
hop
flavor
to
balance
the
sweetness
making
this
brew
very
easy
to
drink
my
only
grievance
is
that
things
fall
apart
a
bit
on
the
back
end
where
an
indefinable
and
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
overstays
its
welcome
that
transgression
is
fairly
minor
though
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
and
i
would
readily
endorse
this
irish
red
ale
as
a
fine
session
beer
and
something
worth
trying
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
little
off
the
beaten
path
bronze
pour
with
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lace
smell
is
biscuit
caramel
grassy
hop
taste
is
cereal
caramel
a
bit
nutty
a
hint
of
sweetness
finish
is
dryish
and
clean
body
holds
together
well
slightly
prickly
carbonation
on
a
semicreamy
feel
pretty
good
fairly
balanced
with
a
touch
more
hops
to
boost
mediumbodied
with
a
sharp
yet
not
intense
hoppiness
notes
there
is
something
about
great
lakes
ales
burning
river
nosferatu
and
now
conway
they
all
have
a
cocoa
aftertaste
conway
is
hoppier
than
any
irish
ale
i
have
ever
had
i
dont
like
anything
about
this
beer
the
color
is
insipid
the
aroma
not
to
the
style
the
taste
out
of
sync
o
my
goodness
i
really
like
great
lakes
i
do
hope
this
is
a
bad
bottle
or
my
taste
buds
are
shot
just
had
a
vanilla
coffee
porter
this
beer
is
almost
vomit
inducing
im
enjoying
my
pint
just
fine
but
i
may
not
order
another
anytime
soon
good
brew
but
i
can
pass
4
0
d
this
is
a
thoroughly
solid
beer
that
goes
down
far
too
easily
though
i
cant
say
im
really
that
impressed
with
any
one
aspect
of
this
beer
im
really
sad
that
i
only
have
one
i
would
do
horrible
things
for
a
couple
more
right
now
love
the
toast
bought
a
six
for
around
eight
bucks
pours
a
nice
deep
copper
color
with
good
thick
sticky
cream
colored
head
smell
is
biscuity
malt
smells
really
good
taste
is
also
biscuity
malt
deep
and
rich
slight
alcohol
on
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
get
in
the
way
a
really
good
malty
substantial
brew
if
only
all
irish
ales
were
this
deep
and
flavorful
one
of
the
few
good
things
to
ever
come
out
of
the
state
of
ohio
o
ive
had
this
in
previous
years
and
thought
it
was
better
but
still
very
good
a
nice
malty
drinkable
irish
ale
it
showcacses
great
lakes
base
malt
perhaps
better
than
any
of
their
other
beers
the
taste
is
really
about
exactly
what
an
irish
red
should
be
malt
driven
not
too
balanced
beautiful
dark
color
for
this
beer
the
flavor
is
very
malt
centered
but
still
well
balanced
it
lets
the
malts
give
off
a
nice
sweetness
with
the
hops
it
balances
out
nicely
pours
a
nice
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
but
not
much
for
lacing
its
not
my
favorite
brew
from
great
lakes
but
i
get
it
every
year
when
it
comes
around
serving
type
bottle
o
an
easy
drinking
irish
red
i
wish
i
had
gotten
a
bit
more
hops
out
of
this
but
not
bad
as
is
o
a
decent
brew
drinks
nicely
and
cleanly
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
with
no
qualms
o
not
what
i
expected
from
great
lakes
but
worth
the
single
bottle
i
bought
toasted
malts
up
front
with
slight
graininess
sweetish
caramel
and
fruit
fill
up
the
palate
toasted
malt
notes
throughout
modest
herbal
hop
presence
gets
a
little
lost
in
the
malt
some
herbal
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
mostly
lingering
fruit
and
honey
toast
mediumbodied
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
nice
example
of
it
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
a
pretty
average
irish
red
ale
it
didnt
have
anything
that
was
out
of
place
for
the
style
but
it
seemed
like
the
flavors
didnt
meld
as
good
as
they
could
of
and
the
sweet
malts
didnt
let
hardly
any
other
flavors
and
aromas
come
through
this
beer
went
down
fairly
smooth
one
went
down
smooth
and
i
might
be
able
to
drink
another
one
but
after
that
i
think
the
sweetness
would
start
to
get
to
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
pretty
spot
on
for
an
irish
red
ale
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
i
think
the
sweetness
needs
to
be
toned
down
some
to
make
this
beer
more
enjoyable
and
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
there
are
better
irish
red
ales
to
be
found
that
are
more
available
at
the
same
price
i
dont
really
recommend
this
beer
unless
you
are
a
huge
irish
red
ale
i
find
it
to
be
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
kind
of
beer
great
lakes
is
a
pretty
solid
brewery
and
this
beer
was
ok
but
it
just
wasnt
that
memorable
of
beer
and
it
really
didnt
hold
my
attention
better
luck
next
time
guys
o
a
perfect
irish
ale
i
will
make
this
brew
always
around
for
the
beginning
of
spring
overall
one
of
the
better
irish
reds
i
have
had
great
drinkability
i
could
drink
several
o
like
i
said
its
a
fine
beer
but
there
is
nothing
that
transcends
the
normal
irish
red
level
for
me
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
body
is
just
thick
enough
to
allow
the
flavors
to
come
out
without
ever
becoming
sticky
or
coating
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
fizzy
but
does
not
interfere
with
the
flavors
and
really
helps
to
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
o
a
solid
irish
red
fits
the
bill
for
the
style
quite
well
its
smooth
and
straightforward
something
great
lakes
has
always
done
well
very
good
session
beer
here
would
love
to
have
this
during
college
football
season
orange
with
a
nice
lasting
head
nose
is
mostly
sweet
malt
tastes
like
roasted
nuts
caramel
and
graham
cracker
with
just
a
touch
of
orange
from
the
hopsi
want
to
like
this
more
than
i
do
as
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
ultimately
its
just
kind
of
there
good
malt
character
and
i
enjoyed
the
three
i
had
but
its
not
a
beer
ill
be
buying
again
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
very
sweet
but
not
sticky
washes
down
clean
bright
clear
copper
pour
with
a
nice
rich
tidy
cream
head
nothing
notable
in
the
nose
just
some
faint
sweet
grass
tinny
and
sweet
malts
are
wrapped
around
a
bouquet
of
juicy
fruit
picking
up
hints
of
orange
lemon
and
some
more
of
that
grass
that
i
smelled
the
creamy
watery
mouthfeel
follows
nicely
with
style
first
time
trying
this
and
i
found
it
an
interesting
and
damn
fine
example
i
have
come
to
expect
great
ness
from
this
brewery
and
it
continues
to
not
disappoint
a
little
too
sweet
but
otherwise
very
good
consistent
with
the
high
quality
beers
churned
out
by
glbc
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
like
it
now
with
a
few
months
of
age
on
it
and
i
can
see
liking
it
fresh
too
o
a
pretty
decent
irish
red
the
malt
character
really
stands
out
and
gives
a
good
flavor
to
the
beer
cherrycopper

i
am
not
typically
a
big
irish
ale
fan
but
this
one
is
okay
would
i
get
it
again
questionable
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
a
lot
it
is
unsung
in
the
great
lakes
lineup
and
provides
a
nice
example
of
a
superdrinkable
amber
ale
overall
a
pleasant
beer
d
the
abv
is
quite
deceptive
here
from
drinking
it
i
could
swear
this
was
a
lot
lower
so
not
quite
sessionable
but
i
dont
think
that
would
stop
me
reco
overall
a
solid
irish
red
i
really
like
the
malt
flavors
well
balanced
and
mild
o
a
very
nice
beer
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
balanced
and
tasty
varied
interesting
and
tempting
this
beer
is
definitely
one
to
try
from
this
company
o
excellent
drinkability
and
taste
overall
even
if
the
brew
is
a
bit
middleoftheroad
a
really
wellrounded
and
unusually
complex
irish
red
ale
here
superior
and
very
delicious
o
d
drinks
pretty
easy
tastes
good
nothing
offensive
but
its
not
something
that
you
cant
help
drinking
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
light
this
is
an
okay
irish
red
ale
the
flavors
are
not
in
balanced
too
malty
unfortunately
this
in
not
one
im
going
to
finish
just
doesnt
fit
the
style
for
me
and
not
a
pleasant
beer
overall
disappointed
as
ive
enjoyed
most
of
glb
other
offerings
overall
a
pretty
solid
irish
red
overall
was
a
decent
beer
not
that
i
expected
in
the
taste
based
on
the
smell
overall
would
be
a
good
session
beer
the
rest
body
is
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
and
the
finish
is
fairly
fast
and
clean
a
decent
beer
of
a
style
i
dont
really
care
for
all
that
much
for
what
its
worth
o
not
a
bad
beer
for
when
wanting
an
easy
drinking
irish
beer
not
as
strong
of
a
tea
taste
as
most
irish
beers
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
either
o
a
decent
beer
that
has
a
great
look
and
an
very
nice
feel
this
ones
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
worth
a
try
but
pretty
runofthemill
overall
dry
light
easy
drinking
i
dont
have
a
wealth
of
experience
with
this
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
good
irish
red
nothing
extraordinary
but
solid
nonetheless
the
flavors
and
aroma
are
simple
but
executed
well
drinkability
this
beer
was
just
ok
for
me
not
bad
at
all
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
enjoyed
by
most
any
craft
beer
enthusiast
reds
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
they
are
ok
on
occasion
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
but
if
you
see
it
maybe
pick
up
a
single
and
give
it
a
try
somehow
this
guy
got
swept
under
the
rug
following
my
recent
jaunt
to
the
firk
ordered
last
to
compliment
my
share
of
a
burger
tasty
stuff
i
tells
ya
it
pours
a
clear
copper
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
caramel
light
greens
oak
and
a
lightish
dash
of
orange
peel
the
taste
follows
fairly
closely
with
notes
of
orange
peel
light
caramel
sweet
rice
and
a
sort
of
celerytype
flavor
everything
has
a
vague
sweetness
to
it
though
a
similarly
vague
bitterness
pervades
as
the
finish
nears
im
still
not
sure
if
they
go
together
all
that
well
ill
get
back
to
ya
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
decent
brew
especially
in
the
capacity
of
accompanying
the
burger
but
frankly
nothing
all
that
special
i
cant
really
knock
any
part
of
it
per
se
but
i
also
cant
rave
about
them
either
you
know
what
i
mean
this
is
a
pretty
good
irish
red
ale
perhaps
a
bit
heavy
on
the
caramel
i
would
drink
it
again
im
glad
i
got
it
as
an
extra
as
it
probably
isnt
a
beer
i
would
have
seeked
out
this
is
one
fine
irish
ale
by
great
lakes
brewery
ive
been
drinking
cases
of
it
for
almost
two
months
i
still
cant
get
enough
of
it
i
saw
some
bad
reviews
posted
on
herebut
all
i
can
say
is
they
must
of
had
a
bad
batch
or
bad
beer
on
tap
this
seems
to
be
better
out
of
the
bottle
it
has
sweet
taste
of
caramela
slightly
hop
bitter
after
taste
a
red
color
and
white
foam
head
this
is
my
favourite
beer
by
glbc
i
look
foward
to
drinking
it
next
year
oyeahi
like
the
label
design
as
well
rock
on
glbc
d4
d
very
drinkable
dangerously
so
id
buy
this
year
round
if
it
was
available
one
of
the
better
great
lakes
products
imho
o
i
feel
that
it
could
have
a
stronger
taste
but
it
is
still
enjoyable
i
feel
that
if
i
could
get
this
around
me
i
would
pick
up
a
six
pack
from
time
to
time
overall
another
irish
red
that
i
just
dont
love
o
i
will
never
drink
another
one
of
these
im
almost
ready
to
proclaim
this
thing
as
awful
great
lakes
is
a
hit
or
miss
for
me
and
this
is
clearly
a
miss
i
would
say
the
cleveland
browns
are
better
than
this
beer
d
ive
been
cherishing
these
but
they
are
definitely
a
sneaky
session
beer
at
6
5
abv
one
of
the
better
irish
red
beers
i
have
had
this
pours
copper
with
one
finger
of
light
head
and
active
bubbles
the
nose
is
sweet
barley
malts
and
fresh
hops
the
taste
is
light
and
grassy
but
the
sweet
malty
flavors
come
on
strong
there
is
a
nice
bite
from
the
bitterness
there
is
a
graininess
that
sticks
around
on
the
aftertaste
longer
than
i
prefer
i
would
classify
this
as
a
crowd
pleasing
easy
drinker
for
those
who
like
craft
brews
anyway
great
pick
for
a
spring
cookout
smooth
and
rich
tasting
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
and
neither
sticky
nor
dry
a
bit
watery
but
it
works
for
the
style
and
beer
in
this
case
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
makes
a
name
for
itself
as
the
sweetness
is
perfectly
leveled
to
keep
the
beer
going
down
easy
swig
after
swig
flavors
go
well
together
and
the
beer
just
works
was
shocked
to
see
this
one
is
6
5
abv
as
it
goes
down
ridiculously
easy
this
is
a
case
of
a
beer
being
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
first
thing
i
noticed
about
this
beer
is
the
unique
herbal
smell
as
i
poured
it
into
the
glass
i
cannot
fully
place
the
smell
but
its
similar
to
some
sort
of
vegetable
or
some
less
than
fresh
fruit
either
way
its
not
something
i
want
my
beer
to
smell
like
the
same
flavor
is
in
the
palate
but
is
milder
and
at
least
there
is
a
good
malt
base
with
toasted
and
caramel
flavors
to
make
it
drinkable
as
for
appearance
the
orange
color
is
less
than
spectacular
and
the
large
amount
of
unexpained
floaties
is
downright
unappealing
not
one
ill
drink
again
o
i
could
perhaps
use
a
stronger
foundation
but
still
this
is
an
original
floral
pleasant
beer
overall
not
bad
the
corn
flavor
is
really
weird
and
unexpected
but
its
still
light
and
drinkable
a
little
sticky
on
the
finish
but
a
crisp
and
dry
ale
d
highly
drinkable
a
nice
beer
for
st
pats
day
you
could
have
two
or
three
of
in
a
sitting
overall
a
good
red
ale
that
isnt
very
sessionable
for
me
notes
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
fullflavored
and
quite
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
only
slightly
noticeable
irish
reds
have
not
always
been
my
favorite
of
styles
but
conways
is
actually
quite
good
overall
another
excellent
beer
from
great
lakes
not
easy
to
get
in
nj
but
its
worth
it
do
your
taste
buds
a
solid
and
try
this
irish
red
ale
overall
excellent
beer
my
favorite
st
pattys
beer
by
a
long
shot
you
will
be
hard
pressed
to
find
an
irish
red
better
than
this
highly
recommended
it
wasnt
as
flavor
full
as
other
irish
ales
but
gls
did
state
this
was
a
medium
bodied
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
doesnt
need
bells
and
whistles
and
simply
wants
a
beer
that
taste
great
and
will
get
the
job
done
the
beer
is
light
and
drinkable
not
really
my
type
of
beer
but
still
can
be
described
as
light
and
drinkable
i
would
lean
towards
gulping
this
one
down
dont
get
your
hopes
up
for
a
supreme
sipper
pricewise
this
beer
is
of
good
value
but
id
still
rather
shell
out
the
dough
for
something
better
or
bitter
or
anything
not
so
generic
tasting
maybe
im
just
on
my
betterbeer
soap
box
but
i
typically
expect
more
from
great
lakes
drinkable
enough
though
sweet
and
malty
to
the
point
where
one
or
two
of
these
is
about
all
i
can
handle
d
incredibly
drinkable
a
beer
you
can
easily
just
enjoy
throughout
the
evening
d
its
tasty
and
appetizing
though
i
like
a
little
more
sweetness
the
high
abv
may
have
fermented
out
all
the
sweet
malt
character
and
that
vegetal
character
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
not
awful
but
sort
of
distracting
i
like
sam
adams
irish
red
a
lot
might
have
to
compare
these
sideby
drinkabilty
very
very
high
so
easy
to
drink
not
real
high
in
alcohol
i
could
rip
through
a
6pack
in
no
time
honestly
great
lakes
should
make
this
all
the
time
not
just
seasonal
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
for
st
pattys
day
d
the
best
beer
of
its
class
and
very
drinkable
despite
its
higher
alcohol
content
not
a
bad
little
beer
here
from
gl
look
is
a
little
mehcolor
is
fine
though
nothing
special
and
theres
very
little
head
even
with
some
swirling
nose
is
paler
malts
a
hint
of
hops
to
it
but
pretty
much
a
straightforward
ale
the
red
malts
dont
make
much
of
a
play
in
the
nose
taste
follows
similar
to
the
nose
and
the
red
malts
make
a
bit
of
a
stronger
play
though
they
are
weak
at
best
overall
the
flavor
is
a
bit
lacking
though
not
necessarily
off
decent
full
mouthfeel
easy
drink
pretty
straightforward
aleits
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
not
going
to
make
you
wish
you
had
a
bmc
d
a
very
drinkable
ale
the
flavors
are
complex
enough
to
make
this
interesting
yet
not
so
over
the
top
you
can
drink
just
one
i
expect
this
has
a
very
broad
appeal
to
the
craft
lover
and
noncraft
lover
quite
enjoyable
ill
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
little
below
a
fingers
worth
of
light
tan
foam
full
mix
of
bubble
sizes
and
types
settles
down
into
a
decent
layer
across
the
surface
the
lacing
starts
off
in
thin
sheets
before
breaking
into
thinner
sheets
sliding
down
the
glass
immaculate
red
amber
color
that
captures
light
very
well
brightening
as
a
result
the
bubbles
appear
haphazardly
you
can
see
some
big
ones
glued
to
the
glass
bottom
the
nose
has
a
big
malty
profile
emphasizing
cocoa
toffee
scone
and
danish
more
breakfast
flakes
than
lunch
bread
mix
of
pepper
and
pine
at

the
peach

fruit
scents
hover
in
the
background
fullbodied
with
somewhat
sloppy
carbonation
foams
through
the
mouth
like
a
gregarious

guy
theres
a
tart
to
outright
sour
element
here
which
tempers
any
excesses
in
the
foundational

finishing
with

more
chocolate
on
the
scene
while
very
good
not
sure
how
many
i
could
drink
in
one
sitting
overall
a
nice
little
beer
in
a
straightforward
style
worth
the
try
if
youre
a
fan
of
irish
reds
but
its
not
going
to
sway
you
if
you
arent
while
not
a
complex
beer
by
any
shape
or
form
it
was
well
balanced
beer
that
was
smooth
and
tasty
malty
and
bready
as
in
the
smell
mild
hops
and
an
underlying
sweetness
while
titillated
my
palate
just
wanted
to
find
a
reason
to
use
the
word
titillated
it
was
crisp
adequately
carbonated
and
finished
a
bit
dry
this
beer
is
uber
drinkable
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
session
beer
but
one
that
i
could
easily
throw
a
bunch
back
and
not
bat
an
eyelash
d
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
no
problem
drinking
this
one
till
you
cant
stand
a
good
example
of
the
style
liked
the
drier
flavor
slightly
sweet
caramel
up
front
wrapped
in
chewy
malt
flavor
with
bread
overtones
finishes
dry
with
a
nice
toasted
oat
flavor
good
flavor
and
a
real
nice

drink
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
can
see
how
it
might
appeal
to
some
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
i
would
not
seek
this
beer
out
again

an
amber
redorange
color
with
a
light
creamy
creamcolored
head
which
quickly
fizzles
yet
retains
a
nice
lace
throughout
the
session
this
irsh
red
ale
has
a
hoppy
toasty

nutty
sweet
malty
flavors
as
well
as
a
nice
bitter

counterbalance
very
full

this
is
a

beer
for

drinking
another
win
for
the
great

it
may
not
be
my
favorite
irish
red
ale
but
its
a
good
one
for
sure
d
if
this
evening
is
any
proof
several
tall
pints
go
down
quite
easily
during
games
of
trivia
another
very
quaffable
brew
from
gl
while
the
bottle
is
tasty
the
drafts
were
even
better
this
is
one
drinkable
beer
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
easy
drinking
mildly
sweet
on
the
front
end
a
little
bitter
at
the
back
but
the
bitterness
is
from
a
type
of
roasted
grain
that
i
find
a
little
odd
i
know
thats
a
brewing
trick
add
a
little
roasted
grain
at
mash
out
for
color
thats
probably
what
happened
here
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
have
it
again
simple
but
very
good
paired
very
well
with
some
orange
chicken
fwiw
nice
work
glbc
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
dangerously
addictive
and
is
hard
to
stop
drinking
it
is
an
impressive
red
ale
that
i
will
be
sad
to
see
go
out
of
season
d
wow
i
have
know
ales
to
be
either
really
light
or
heavy
in
flavor
but
this
one
seems
balanced
and
creamy
abv
is
well
masked
another
solid
offering
from
great
lakes
the
beer
pours
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
an
excellent
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
biscuit
malts
it
has
a
mild
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
dry
irish
ale
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
with
some
toastedbready
notes
this
has
got
to
be
the
most
complex
irish
ale
ive
ever
tried
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
its
full
flavored
with
excellent
malt
character
and
a
smooth
finish
this
beer
pours
a
clear
bright
red
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
tea
leaves
toast
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
is
slightly
maltier
than
the
aroma
but
still
quite
balanced
there
are
some
very
nice
strong
tea
notes
that
blend
well
with
the
toffee
and
caramel
of
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
beer
is
really
really
good
and
spot
on
for
the
style
i
will
certainly
be
drinking
a
lot
of
this
while
its
around
all
in
all
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
probably
a
good
choice
for
someone
that
is
leaving
the
standard
miller
bud
coors
line
of
beers
and
starting
to
try
new
things
this
one
will
certainly
not
frighten
you
away
from
the
microbrewery
scene
this
is
being
reviewed
from
the
cleveland
oh
airport
thats
right
trying
new
beers
on
the
road
this
is
a
nice
tasting
and
smelling
beer
sweet
and
malty
without
a
lot
of
hops
smells
brown
sugar
and
nutmeg
and
tastes
the
same
as
well
what
its
lacking
in
is
presentation
not
a
lot
of
head
or
carbonation
almost
trio
the
point
where
im
wondering
if
its
fresh
theyve
served
3
glasses
of
it
while
im
reviewing
it
so
it
must
be
right
either
way
the
flavor
the
noise
and
the
mouthfeel
make
it
an
overall
drinkable
beer
d
very
drinkable
a
little
on
the
light
end
for
the
style
but
good
nonetheless
d
a
robust
very
tasty
irish
red
from
great
lakes
fairly
heavy
hitting
for
the
style
but
it
manages
to
avoid
being
too
sweet
or
too
alcoholic
at
any
point
no
surprises
here
from
great
lakes
a
polished
delicious
spring
seasonal
drinkability
probably
the
best
irish
red
i
have
although
this
is
admittedly
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
it
really
does
remind
of
their
christmas
ale
in
many
ways
but
not
quite
at
the
same
level
of
enjoyment
for
me
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
drinkability
easy
drinker
no
problem
having
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
d
a
nice
red
ale
some
nice
bready
and
toasted
malts
and
a
nice
creamy
body
would
have
again
pours
a
dark
caramel
like
appearance
has
a
small
head
that
stays
thin
enough
to
drink
through
but
there
the
whole
way
through
it
has
a
bread
like
smell
it
tastes
like
bread
almost
at
first
and
then
has
a
calm
flavor
afterwards
with
a
bread
like
after
taste
it
is
a
good
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
would
be
good
with
a
traditional
irish
dinner
will
get
this
again
not
my
favourite
glbc
brew
but
its
up
there
good
one
here
sad
it
took
me
this
long
to
review
this
one
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
will
be
buying
more
of
it
d
it
above
average
tasting
crisp
and
malty
red
that
went
down
pretty
quick
not
one
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
would
drink
again
this
beers
a
great
change
of
pace
w
all
of
the
ipas
and
stouts
out
which
i
love
very
enjoyable
beer
this
really
is
a
meat
and
potatoes
kind
of
beer
recommended
drinkability
its
at
this
point
in
the
day
where
i
love
to
kick
back
sip
a
beer
and
think
this
beer
is
great
for
that
its
not
boisterous
or
bombasticit
has
a
particular
laid
back
quality
where
you
just
want
to
casually
sip
it
with
a
good
meal
no
flavors
possessing
overthetop
strength
here
like
many
more
popular
beers
but
a
great
beer
in
its
own
right
and
definitely
worth
a
try
ive
heard
this
one
described
as
watered
down
christmas
ale
and
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
if
youve
heard
and
maybe
even
acted
on
such
statements
leading
you
away
from
this
beer
in
the
past
go
ahead
and
give
it
a
chance
d
the
sweetness
detracts
a
little
but
this
beer
is
still
very
drinkable
and
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
foodsits
flavor
and
body
seem
designed
for
warm
hearty
dinners
md
nice
and
smooth
easytodrink
beer
ill
be
buying
this
in
a
12
pack
if
i
see
it
again
while
not
sessionable
compared
to
the
more
mainstream
irish
beers
its
good
to
know
that
if
you
are
looking
for
that
craft
beer
around
march
17th
that
has
a
bit
more
depth
this
one
will
fill
that
void
taste
sturdier
than
your
average
red
ale
traditional
in
that
it
doesnt
have
any
overpowering
aspect
of
it
falls
to
the
side
of
malt
heavy
tea
toast
nothing
offensive
just
an
easy
drinking
red
ale
with
a
little
bit
more
substance
than
your
average
one
you
might
come
across
ive
had
many
bottles
of
this
as
well
but
conways
is
excellent
as
a
draft
pours
a
really
nice
clear
copper
color
nice
smallfoam
tannish
head
smell
is
nice
and
airy
a
bit
on
the
bready
side
taste
is
malty
chewy
with
an
awesome
sweetness
that
permeates
no
tankardtaste
a
sweet
malt
that
blends
perfectly
with
the
mild
hoppiness
little
hops
to
speak
of
but
the
finish
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
imbibe
with
dinner
a
meat
and
potatoes
beer
indeed
with
a
mediumheavy
mouthfeel
i
found
this
beer
to
be
slightly
chewy
with
all
the
malt
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
puts
other
american
irish
ales
to
shame
if
you
enjoy
a
good
hearty
malted
beer
then
please
give
this
one
a
shot
overall
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
nothing
all
that
memorable
but
drinkable
d
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
i
really
dont
prefer
red
ales
over
other
types
i
would
define
this
as
a
good
session
beer
maybe
some
people
wouldnt
d
this
beer
is
a
interesting
drinker
for
me
i
have
no
problem
finishing
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
reluctent
for
another
one
due
to
the
sweetness
of
it
d
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
could
have
had
some
hop
flavor
but
it
was
good
this
would
be
good
with
a
steak
dinner
dreally
easy
drinking
and
another
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
overall
this
ranks
up
there
with
my
favorite
irish
reds
if
only
it
were
available
yearround
d
this
actually
went
well
with
my
hot
wings
its
got
a
little
bit
of
bittersour
aftertaste
that
would
prevent
me
from
having
more
than
one
but
its
more
than
i
expected
for
a
place
that
doesnt
normally
serve
craft
beers
the
taste
fits
the
style
perfectly
a
nince
malty
beer
with
a
mild
but
present
hop
character
glad
to
have
it
on
tap
despite
the
way
it
was
presented
overall
great
lakes
is
starting
to
turn
my
opinion
of
them
around
with
a
few
of
my
last
choices
from
them
the
previous
irish
ale
i
had
before
conways
was
dundee
red
which
was
extremely
drinkable
tasty
but
a
bit
more
generic
to
find
a
beer
directly
in
the
middle
of
this
and
dundee
would
be
optimal
very
good
job
gl
d
altogether
a
good
beer
tasty
enjoyable
and
i
could
sit
down
for
a
night
of
these
but
that
being
said
it
is
a
little
forgettable
and
is
not
the
strongest
in
their
lineup
overall
an
unoffensive
but
not
particularly
noteworthy
beer
i
thought
easy
enough
to
put
away
but
much
more
boring
than
ive
found
other
great
lakes
beers
thus
far
d
a
decent
brew
that
unfortunately
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
more
than
one
of
these
perfect
for
a
quench
of
thirst
with
a
meal
or
just
enjoying
ruby
amber
with
a
dense
creamy
khaki
head
that
leaves
sheets
of
beautiful
lace
on
the
glass
lighty
toasted
grain
earthy
hops
and
caramel
in
the
nose
sweet
toffee
and
bready
maltiness
with
citrusy
and
herbal
hop
notes
a
little
sweeter
and
a
little
hoppier
than
most
of
the
style
medium
light
bodied
with
a
sticky
mouthfeel
a
fine
ale
d
easy
drinkable
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
another
good
beer
from
the
folks
at
great
lakes
brewing
co
d
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
the
bitter
bite
at
the
end
really
rounds
off
this
beer
i
will
probably
be
enjoying
the
rest
of
these
tomorrow
for
st
pattys
day
d
quaffable
and
refreshing
i
might
need
another
six
pack
for
st
patricks
day
another
solid
beer
from
the
folks
at
great
lakes
good
job
great
lakes
dthis
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
great
lakes
does
a
very
good
job
with
everything
they
make
very
well
balanced
and
big
flavors
make
this
something
that
goes
down
smooth
and
makes
you
want
another
sip
very
drinkable
brew
my
personal
favorite
of
what
ive
tried
from
great
lakes
so
far
d
not
a
style
i
am
particularly
fond
of
but
this
does
a
decent
job
at
representing
an
irish
red
could
go
a
few
of
the
flavor
profiles
as
this
drinks
to
me
a
lot
like
a
light
christmas
beer
a
very
good
beer
for
an
irish
red
overall
let
it
warm
and
enjoy
overall
really
liked
it
smell
is
toasted
malt
faint
hops
and
sweetness
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
the
smell
but
it
is
pleasant
and
not
overpowering
taste
is
toffee
bready
and
light
hops
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
its
full
and
malty
with
good
carbonation
which
is
right
where
it
needs
to
be
without
being
a
distraction
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
enjoy
it
frequently
if
i
had
access
this
seems
like
a
good
beer
to
introduce
people
into
craft
a
very
healthy
medium
body
on
this
and
very
sweet
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
kinda
reminds
me
of
sucking
on
a
worthers
original
for
a
second
this
was
a
easy
one
to
take
down
perhaps
thats
the
irish
in
me
its
simple
no
more
no
less
i
can
see
this
going
downhill
in
the
bottle
fairly
quickly
so
drink
up
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
drinkable
nicely
flavored
brew
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
one
of
the
better
irish
ales
that
i
have
had
for
sure
i
cant
believe
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
the
cop
on
the
label
must
have
scared
me
my
notes
say
great
beef
for
sprung
sessions
i
think
i
meant
beer
and
spring
but
at
any
rate
thats
what
i
fat
fingered
into
my
iphone
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
i
like
it
drinkability
quite
enjoyed
this
one
yet
another
solid
brew
from
great
lakes
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
o
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
gl
beer
behind
edmund
fitzgerald
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
can
have
several
of
these
in
a
night
as
they
taste
quite
good
and
they
wont
leave
me
unable
to
function
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
brian
boru
but
a
very
respectable
irish
red
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
fun
to
drink
slow
not
an
easy
chugger
great
dinner
beer
with
chicken
another
fine
seasonal
effort
from
great
lakes
slainte
another
great
brew
from
great
lakes
something
ive
come
to
expect
over
time
d
nice
complex
malt
flavor
a
little
too
sweet
the
lingering
finish
brings
the
drinkability
down
some
for
me
pretty
good
malt
aroma
and
flavor
i
just
feel
like
it
needs
to
dry
out
a
little
more
medium
body
smooth
and
just
a
small
gentle
carbonation
md
medium
body
with
big
carbonation
both
in
volumes
and
on
the
palate
semidry
finish
and
has
a
certain
stickiness
on
the
plate
very
drinkable
and
clean
with
the
low
alcohol
lets
you
drink
a
bunch
of
these
at
one
time
d
could
work
on
a
6
no
prob
d
very
drinkable
beer
other
than
the
bitterness
theres
nothing
thats
likely
to
turn
anyone
off
about
it
very
light
for
an
ale
a
good
choice
for
a
full
stomach
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
a
little
bite
but
dont
have
a
taste
for
sweet
this
would
go
great
with
roasted
peppers
cabbage
broccoli
endive
salad
stuff
like
that
thoughts
i
love
the
history
behind
this
brew
nice
to
see
respect
given
to
ones
elders
as
for
the
brew
it
was
a
good
try
at
the
style
and
it
made
an
excellent
baked
chicken
so
i
would
have
it
again
for
sure
this
is
a
very
drinkable
if
not
very
complex
ale
it
is
surprising
to
see
the
6
5
abv
on
the
label
as
this
drinks
like
a
classic
low
alcohol
english
bitter
this
is
probably
the
least
favorite
beer
of
mine
in
the
great
lakes
line
up
d
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
and
comfortable
beer
enjoy
one
after
work
or
anytime
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
for
more
than
a
couple
but
your
mileage
may
vary
while
never
being
a
great
fan
of
the
style
ive
always
loved
great
lakes
and
would
probably
rank
them
as
the
prime
contender
for
my
favourite
brewery
theyve
done
another
good
job
here
though
even
their
efforts
wont
win
me
over
its
just
a
little
simple
and
plain
a
pleasant
beer
for
sure
but
my
complaint
with
the
whole
style
has
always
been
that
its
lacks
the
complexity
to
ever
be
anything
greater
than
pleasant
d
its
not
very
tasty
or
intense
its
almost
too
mild
to
care
about
it
certainly
wont
wear
you
out
but
its
not
offensive
id
want
something
more
flavorful
to
session
but
if
you
dig
extremely
mild
european
ales
you
might
want
this
im
not
very
impressed
with
this
really
its
a
rare
miss
by
my
hometown
brewery
this
beer
has
set
the
benchmark
for
irish
ales
i
will
make
a
point
this
year
to
try
more
of
the
style
and
see
if
there
is
a
better
one
out
there
until
then
this
one
is
gonna
be
a
hard
one
to
topple
well
worth
seeking
out
d
a
meat
and
potatoes
kind
of
beer
indeed
would
be
great
with
a
nice
down
to
earth
homecooked
meal
almost
sessionable
at
6
5
notes
i
love
great
lakes
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
i
also
converted
my
mother
and
step
father
to
craft
beer
with
this
irish
ale
how
cool
is
that
this
is
an
amazing
example
of
the
style
and
a
great
beer
all
around
nicely
done
d
a
really
nice
solid
ale
man
its
nice
to
drink
something
clean
and
simple
in
these
days
of
big
and
complex
its
just
a
good
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
another
nice
brew
to
enjoy
from
great
lakes
they
really
know
how
to
make
beer
in
any
case
this
is
a
great
irish
red
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
catholics
and
prots
alike
can
get
behind
something
like
this
bottom
line
recommended
especially
with
irish
stew
or
haggis
dangit
there
i
go
again
d
once
you
have
one
you
want
another
abv
a
little
higher
than
your
typical
brew
but
you
really
wouldnt
notice
by
the
taste
pours
a
clear
light
coppery
orange
dark
amber
thin
white
head
forms
wispy
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
not
much
there
no
real
lacing
doesnt
look
too
exciting
smell
is
nice
and
malty
caramel
some
really
toasty
and
grainy
malt
oatscereal
light
floral
very
malty
taste
is
similar
very
sweet
oranges
some
grainy
malt
biscuit
cereal
light
fruitiness
in
the
finish
low
bitterness
not
too
exciting
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
alright
beer
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
boring
and
light
drinks
very
easy
not
the
best
irish
red
ive
had
has
some
aesthetic
issues
but
session
worthy
d
solid
brew
to
be
sure
i
have
yet
to
taste
a
poor
offering
from
great
lakes
and
this
is
no
exception
i
think
they
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
by
calling
this
a
meat
and
potatoes
kind
of
beer
on
the
label
its
a
no
frills
solid
good
tasting
beer
recommend
it
was
a
great
beer
excellent
for
a
session
not
the
best
irish
red
ive
had
but
far
from
the
worst
hits
all
the
right
notes
without
challenging
the
taste
buds
but
without
surprising
them
either
one
of
those
brews
and
styles
you
wouldnt
be
ashamed
to
stick
with
when
youre
sick
of
throwing
down
big
beers
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
there
could
be
a
bit
more
punch
in
the
flavor
given
the
abv
or
could
lower
the
abv
the
bit
while
keeping
the
current
profile
drinkability
as
mentioned
in
the
taste
portion
above
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
and
easy
going
not
challenging
at
all
but
very
tasty
and
fulfilling
to
me
this
one
comes
across
as
a
little
more
unique
because
of
breadylike
quality
i
know
i
keep
coming
back
to
that
but
i
really
find
that
to
be
most
pleasing
i
give
this
a
higher
drinkability
because
it
is
indeed
easy
to
get
down
but
also
the
abv
is
pretty
doable
the
conways
irish
ale
has
a
good
aroma
and
flavor
profile
to
it
with
out
commanding
your
attention
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
hue
with
a
short
lasting
head
i
picked
up
lots
of
malts
and
toffeecarmel
in
the
aroma
the
finish
improves
as
the
beer
warms
as
the
carbonation
is
a
little
to
prickly
at
first
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
extraordinary
pours
clear
reddish
orange
with
a
little
head
dissapating
into
a
light
lace
smells
of
faint
honey
with
a
mild
hop
note
taste
is
slight
hoppiness
with
a
honey
like
aftertaste
and
a
bit
of
sweet
grass
drinkability
is
good
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
not
of
of
great
lakes
best
this
brew
has
a
very
earthy
character
which
lends
itself
nicely
to
the
irish
style
drinkability
high
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
for
this
time
of
year
d
more
punch
than
the
standard
irish
red
but
still
easy
to
drink
d
actually
pretty
good
considering
the
6
5
abv
here
is
one
of
those
cases
where
the
beer
from
the
tap
is
sooo
much
better
than
out
of
the
bottle
i
will
review
the
tap
version
and
give
great
lakes
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
i
had
one
several
years
ago
from
the
bottle
and
was
not
impressed
even
disappointed
since
i
have
been
a
huge
glb
fan
since
the
late
90s
have
made
several
trips
to
the
brewery
mecca
over
the
years
my
last
trip
my
buddy
advised
that
i
try
it
as
a
draft
i
did
and
it
was
like
a
different
brew
it
came
to
life
with
punch
and
aroma
it
delivered
on
a
brilliant
irish
red
which
can
be
drank
endlessly
when
done
right
bartender
pour
me
another
this
ones
on
eliot
ness
d
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
sometimes
reds
can
get
boring
but
this
is
very
full
flavored
while
maintaining
the
approachability
that
reds
are
known
for
i
really
enjoy
most
irish
ales
but
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
one
i
had
just
sampled
michelob
irish
red
and
felt
that
this
one
tasted
a
little
watered
down
the
smell
and
appearance
were
great
but
was
thinner
than
i
expected
when
drinking
great
lakes
has
so
many
great
products
it
was
a
shame
that
this
one
fell
a
little
short
i
love
great
lakes
beers
and
this
was
no
exception
maybe
its
the
yeast
strain
they
use
but
many
of
their
beers
share
taste
characteristics
ive
tasted
many
of
the
same
notes
in
their
oktoberfest
and
christmas
ales
goes
down
easy
and
will
rate
high
drinkability
wise
this
is
a
hearty
ale
very
different
from
a
lot
of
irish
reds
ive
had
but
good
in
its
own
right
pours
a
nice
midcopper
color
with
good
initial
head
although
it
rapidly
fades
and
there
is
no
lacing
a
fair
bit
of
carbonation
as
well
nice
scent
deep
almost
like
a
brown
ale
with
just
a
hint
of
sour
to
it
good
taste
a
bit
of
irish
red
sour
but
with
noticable
hop
tones
and
a
deeper
thick
malt
flavor
goes
down
quite
well
if
a
tad
over
carbonated
nice
irishstyle
red
ale
drinkability
this
one
was
very
odd
very
heavy
on
the
fruits
moderate
on
most
everything
else
it
wasnt
unpleasant
but
i
cant
say
it
was
stylistically
too
accurate
the
6
5
is
also
pretty
up
there
for
the
style
id
have
it
at
a
party
but
i
dunno
if
id
seek
it
out
in
the
future
i
think
i
should
go
out
tomorrow
and
try
to
find
some
more
before
they
are
gone
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
they
are
so
filling
im
not
sure
i
could
session
them
drinkability
is
very
high
a
good
beer
to
session
with
jonathan
passow
d
a
good
offering
worth
a
try
taste
is
less
crisp
of
crystal
malt
than
youd
expect
a
little
more
like
a
mild
with
rounded
edges
and
slight
raisny
notes
mouthfeel
is
pretty
heavy
for
an
irish
red
with
peppery
carbonation
a
little
slick
and
oily
for
me
in
terms
of
overall
mouthfeel
and
taste
oh
well
ill
just
keep
drinking
the
rest
of
their
excellent
collection
drinkability
is
awesome
on
this
irish
red
this
beer
is
a
nicely
balanced
selection
that
has
some
really
great
tastes
to
it
but
nothing
so
strong
that
you
can
get
sick
of
it
one
of
the
better
irish
reds
i
have
ever
had
but
a
nice
session
beer
to
drink
all
day
the
way
the
irish
intended
future
outlook
this
beer
just
didnt
quite
come
together
for
me
a
rare
miss
for
great
lakes
though
still
not
something
that
i
would
say
was
bad
or
push
away
if
offered
i
wont
seek
this
out
again
but
could
accept
it
as
part
of
a
variety
mixpack
great
lakes
conways
irish
red
ale
is
a
clear
amber
ale
with
a
fading
white
head
it
has
a
slightly
sweet
aroma
thats
a
little
resiny
it
is
medium
bodied
smooth
bubbly
and
the
finish
is
clean
it
is
simple
and
balanced
with
notes
of
resin
smoke
and
peat
it
has
a
good
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
not
bad
on
the
plus
side
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
a
few
of
these
to
sip
on
with
definitely
clear
your
mind
and
make
you
relaxed
in
no
time
definitely
worth
a
purchase
give
it
a
try
easy
going
good
taste
smooth
and
delicious
notes
not
great
lakes
best
offering
and
maybe
one
of
their
weakest
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
glbc
it
is
a
seasonal
beer
but
i
wish
it
wasnt
i
reviewed
it
from
draft
but
it
is
just
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
the
only
complaint
i
had
was
that
it
was
served
too
cold
the
twelve
pack
box
is
a
wonderful
buy
do
not
hesitate
to
pick
some
up
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
great
lakes
never
lets
me
down
cheers
poured
from
a
bottle
pours
deep
copper
with
light
head
smell
is
very
malty
the
taste
is
huge
malts
with
little
hop
presence
really
i
kind
of
get
a
wet
hop
flavor
which
i
found
odd
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
perfect
nice
light
carbonation
this
is
pretty
decent
but
after
maybe
a
few
i
would
be
looking
for
something
new
d
another
great
brew
from
glbc
this
is
an
excellent
example
the
the
irish
red
style
soft
carbonation
makes
me
contemplate
the
flavor
of
this
beer
not
as
quite
straightforward
as
the
aroma
but
close
there
is
a
slightly
sweet
hop
fruitiness
in
this
beer
that
is
easily
balanced
with
remarkably
fresh
cereal
grains
i
could
go
on
about
this
beer
but
then
i
wouldnt
be
drinking
it
any
longer
it
has
pretty
much
everything
i
like
in
a
beer
hops
that
are
not
overly
done
malts
that
are
not
overly
sweet
a
nice
dryness
that
makes
me
yearn
for
another
sip
and
a
mouthfeel
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
cask
ale
than
a
bottle
of
soda
go
out
and
get
this
stuff
while
its
fresh
d
ive
had
this
beer
twice
and
have
to
say
that
the
first
time
it
made
a
stronger
impression
than
it
did
this
time
however
with
that
said
it
really
comes
off
as
more
a
of
a
lighter
ale
than
an
irish
red
its
refreshing
and
the
flavors
are
nice
but
could
stand
to
be
slightly
more
pronounced
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
not
much
to
this
one
a
very
light
irish
ale
very
average
too
below
average
i
dont
think
this
batch
was
up
to
snuff
great
lakes
never
disappoints
and
this
is
no
exception
a
great
example
of
the
style
seasonal
irish
amber
from
great
lakes
named
after
their
grandfather
an
honor
for
sure
faintly
sweet
malty
aroma
not
much
else
aside
from
a
very
low
key
hop
nose
twinkling
amber
pour
sizable
head
that
soon
becomes
a
thin
film
leaving
mild
lacing
crisp
with
an
easy
finish
this
has
a
real
good
medium
bodied
fullness
to
it
flavor
is
more
intense
than
the
aroma
lots
of
sweet
malts
caramel
and
a
touch
of
honey
low
key
hop
presence
nice
change
from
this
brewer
overall
one
of
great
lakes
more
simple
beers
but
its
a
nice
choice
for
its
respective
style
very
enjoyable
taste
peppery
hops
with
a
hint
of
citrus
perfectly
balanced
by
amber
malts
and
breaded
notes

kiss
of
alcohol

complex
and
intriguing
finish

an

should
feel
like

this
offering
form
great

pours
amberred
with
a
tall
white
head
there
was
a
sent
of
toasted
malts
and
seeds
the
malt
profile
is
of
slight
carmel
roasted
nuts
and
toffie
there
is
not
too
much
for
the
hops
because
the
malt
is
so
dominent
there
is
a
nice
malty
body
with
a
reasonable
amount
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
has
too
much
bitter
coffie
flavors
d
not
bad
its
a
fairly
simple
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
how
often
i
would
pick
it
up
in
the
future
d
a
great
brew
and
excellent
example
for
the
style
very
drinkable
pours
with
a
orangish
coppery

that
leaves

first
smell
is
sweet
flowery
hops
and
very
slight
malt
coming
through
malt
hits
first
with
a
kind
of
a
toasted
creamy
hop
afterwards
its
not
a
sick
creamy
though
just
the
texture
this
one
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
an
overall
good
drinkability
im
usually
not
an
over
the
top
hops
guy
but
this
is
a
good
balance
definately
recommend
da
nice
combonation
of
malts
and
a
very
drinkable
ale
overall
another
winner
from
great
lakes
thanks
to
pimppfor
the
chance
to
try
this
d
drinkability
is
good
for
this
one
i
could
very
easily
drink
many
of
these
with
no
problem
sweet
light

flavor
very
creamy

the
flavor
is
a
touch
bland
for
6
5
abv
i
do
get
a
touch
of
vegetable
dms
but
im
not
sure
if
thats
completely
inappropriate
for
the
style
theres
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
in
the
end
but
in
general
its
pretty
tasty
id
like
it
to
be
lower
in
abv
because
this
beer
could
sneak
up
on
me
fast
drinkability
a
fine
session
beer
looks
like
itll
be
st
patties
day
all
week
i
see
a
bright
yet
deep
amberycopper
very
little
head
but
a
cool
column
of
tiny
bubbles
spewing
from
the
bottom
center
of
the
glass
very
uniform
the
aroma
is
a
pretty
inviting
baked
then
quickly
toasted
old
fashioned
white
bread
it
just
smells
warm
and
comforting
the
first
sip
is
great
toasted
malts
bread
with
a
smooth
light
caramel
finish
the
palate
is
very
upfront
nt
a
lot
of
stuff
lurking
in
the
shadows
no
real
nuances
just
great
malt
and
a
hint
of
caramel
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
know
the
boarderline
of
session
beers
is
5
0
and
this
one
is
at
6
5
but
i
would
call
it
sessionable
no
matter
what
the
abv
is
you
are
gonna
feel
the
effects
after
5
or
6
this
is
a
good
choice
if
you
are
feeling
a
little
irish
and
dont
want
or
are
afraid
of
the
dark
not
my
favorite
from
glbc
but
that
is
mostly
because
of
the
style
this
beer
is
classicly
good
this
ale
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
light
copper
color
with
a
thin
white
head
a
moderatehigh
malty
aroma
rises
from
the
beer
toasty
grains
and
some
breadiness
the
flavor
is
highly
malty
toasty
and
breadylike
the
aroma
the
hop
bitterness
is
moderate
with
a
bit
of
hop
flavor
at
the
swallow
the
body
is
medium
and
moderate
carbonation
delivers
an
appropriate
prick
at
the
swallow
overall
a
tasty
brew
nice
malt
profile
without
being
too
sweet
slightly
dry
toasty
finish
is
pleasant
poured
into
pint
glass
reddish
amber
with
minimal
head
less
than
half
inch
on
the
pour
with
but
tight
smells
roasty
and
tastes
similar
with
fresh
tea
like
flavor
pekoe
hitting
the
back
of
your
taste
buds
this
is
nicely
carbed
and
and
very
drinkable
this
beer
poured
a
beautiful
reddishorange
hue
however
there
was
hardly
any
head
even
when
poured
harshly
its
nose
definitely
had
a
caramel
malt
presence
with
a
little
smokiness
in
back
its
taste
was
mild
in
my
opinion
caramel
with
moderate
malt
and
a
little
smokiness
in
the
back
just
as
in
its
smell
i
didnt
particularly
like
its
mouthfeel
its
carbonation
vanished
as
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
my
glass
giving
it
a
flat
feel
more
carbonation
would
have
made
it
much
more
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
but
ive
had
better
from
great
lakes
pours
a
rich
clear
honeyamber
with
a
finger
of
smooth
tan
head
smooth
malt
dominates
the
aroma
with
a
tiny
bit
of
citrus
and
some
woodiness
and
caramel
a
wellrounded
mild
hop
scent
draws
it
all
together
for
the
first
second
the
heavier
side
of
the
malt
is
present
but
it
is
immediately
followed
by
the
hops
and
lightens
up
to
a
caramel
bread
flavor
the
citrus
is
present
but
fleeting
which
is
fine
because
i
think
too
much
would
have
ruined
the
brew
overall
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
perfect
for
an
easy
social
drink
or
to
have
with
a
burger
d
good
beer
nothing
special
but
its
a
good
change
of
pace
moreys
bottom
line
this
beer
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
so
much
so
that
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
lager
fortunately
there
is
enough
alelike
qualities
to
set
it
apart
for
a
red
it
was
good
for
holding
up
production
of
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
blackout
stout
well
i
hate
it
id
say
it
was
about
what
i
suspected
having
thried
their
other
offering
it
was
a
good
beer
but
not
one
to
seek
out
id
settle
for
four
months
of
blackout
and
none
of
this
on
tap
at
beef
obradys
in
centerville
oh
nice
golden
amber
to
red
color
with
a
small
white
head
which
was
quickly
gone
nice
malty
smell
malty
caramel
taste
with
some
biscuit
flavor
and
a
small
hoppy
bitter
bite
at
the
end
one
of
the
many
nice
beers
by
great
lakes
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
a
pretty
straight
forward
beer
pretty
drinkable
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
poured
a
light
reddish
color
with
a
creamy
style
off
white
head
that
lingered
for
a
bit
and
then
slowly
died
down
plenty
of
sweet
toffee
malt
is
initially
picked
up
slightly
floral
hops
but
there
is
another
smell
somewhat
like
tea
leaves
taste
is
the
toffee
sweetness
with
not
much

at
all
to

mostly
a
bready
malt
here

feel
is
slightly
creamy

a
little
more

down
crisp

much
like
a
lager
very
smooth
drinkable
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
to
medium
bodied
pretty
well
carbonated
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
its
a
solid
beer
d
not
quite
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
offerings
but
yet
another
solid
brew
from
glbc
d
no
problem
knockin
em
back
tonight
too
bad
its
only
a
seasonal
release
a
solid
brew
probably
my
favorite
irish
red
to
date
this
is
a
great
brew
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
but
i
guess
thats
okay
its
got
a
light
roastiness
and
sweetness
throughout
that
is
backed
up
with
a
bit
of
hops
i
am
pleased
to
know
that
everything
coming
from
glbc
has
a
consistently
high
level
of
quality
drinkability
is
also
good
could
have
a
couple
of
these
but
would
maybe
get
bored
after
two
or
three
better
than
what
i
see
offered
at
a
lot
of
my
local
pubs
the
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
creamy
half
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
quite
sweet
and
malty
the
flavor
has
a
good
bit
of
caramalized
malt
and
grassy
hops
it
has
a
heavy
mouthfeel
and
prickly
carbonation
this
is
quite
different
than
i
was
expecting
in
a
good
way
i
would
deffinately
get
a
sixer
of
this
to
share
with
friends
not
a
bad
brew
not
what
i
was
expecting
no
nutty
or
carmel
character
somewhat
of
a
malt
and
refreshing
hop
character
to
it
though
i
liked
this
brew
overall
but
not
the
best
irish
red
i
have
ever
had
i
do
reccomend
it
as
worth
a
try
its
not
bad
overall
eric
pours
a
clear
reddish
amber
with
little
head
and
no
retention
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
no
hop
character
taste
is
very
like
iced
tea
with
some
roastiness
and
strawberry
present
a
fine
beer
but
nothing
remarkable
i
wouldnt
be
interested
in
having
it
again
especially
when
it
sits
next
to
commodore
perry
all
rounded
out
to
a
smooth
pleasant
finish
not
a
great
beer
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
session
beer
as
i
had
several
as
is
the
case
with
nearly
all
great
lakes
creations
i
never
get
tired
on
this
beer
its
even
better
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
i
impatiently
wait
for
its
release
each
year
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
brings
the
drinkability
down
a
little
but
this
is
still
a
very
nice
satisfying
take
on
the
style
the
rich
lightly
sweet
caramelish
toasty
and
berryish
flavors
of
conways
irish
ale
are
sure
to
please
its
deepambercopper
body
glows
with
orange
and
gold
highlights
and
the
creamy
offwhite
head
holds
just
fine
leaving
behind
spotty
walls
of
lace
the
nose
is
clean
with
a
malty
and
fruity
edge
its
medium
bodied
and
gently
crisp
on
the
tongue
in
many
ways
its
just
your
basic
irish
red
ale
but
it
does
have
a
distinct
malty
character
thats
caramelish
toasty
and
offers
the
suggestion
of
some
roastiness
in
the
background
blanced
towards
sweetness
the
bitterness
is
just
enough
to
give
it
ballast
and
keep
it
from
becoming
sweet
nicely
done
light
to
medium
body
has
a
light
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
a
nice
pleasing
taste
thats
easy
drinking
this
is
my
choice
for
st
patty
day
next
year
could
drink
this
all
night
chilled
and
poured
into
nonic
the
head
rose
and
immediately
fell
its
a
sparse
film
lingering
on
the
surface
the
body
is
a
hearty
golden
amber
sort
of
a
light
shade
of
southern
style
sweet

smells
of
light
hoppiness

overall
pleasant
in

category
this
beer
combines
a
bit
of
a
smokey
blend
to
it
with
a
rather
sharp
bite
to
it
between
the
balance
of
malt
to
hops
overall
a
selection
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
find
on
the
kickoff
of
this
st
patricks
day
weekend
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
it
sustains
a
smooth
lighter
mouthfeel
to
it
as
the
flavor
profile
is
reminiscent
of
a
good
poured
from
a
growler
i
got
7
days
ago
from
the
brewery
seems
that
7
days
may
have
been
a
little
much
this
seemed
to
have
more
sharpness
to
it
last
week
but
maybe
ti
was
the
food
i
was
eating
nice
middle
of
the
road
sweet
beer
this
was
tough
to
rate
since
it
is
categorized
as
an
american
red
ale
which
it
doesnt
really
present
itself
as
in
which
case
i
thought
it
was
a
below
average
american
red
ale
but
a
very
good
irish
red
ale
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brew
pub
served
in
a
pint
glass
a
beautiful
rich
amber
color
with
a
nice
one
and
a
half
finger
head
on
it
the
aroma
was
nicely
developed
and
not
overwhelming
to
the
point
where
it
overpowered
the
beer
when
i
drank
it
i
could
taste
the
richness
of
the
hops
and
malts
which
made
the
beer
that
much
better
if
you
can
get
this
on
draft
get
it
i
said
to
the
bartender
that
they
should
bottlecan
this
brew
and
the
bartender
said
that
he
would
pass
it
on
i
like
this
brew
and
found
it
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
i
would
order
a
pint
of
this
if
i
was
sticking
around
for
a
meal
too
a
simple
wellbalanced
choice
from
lbc
poured
a
clear
copper
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
and
noticeable
carbonation
mild
malts
and
grains
in
the
aroma
and
a
hint
of
hops
toasted
grains
and
malts
on
the
tongue
nutty
and
again
just
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
a
little
stale
in
the
aftertaste
mediumlight
mouthfeel
not
too
flavorful
but
drinkable
overall
poured
a
deep
amber
it
was
bittery
and
hoppy
smell
was
not
really
all
that
upfront
lively
this
one
was
an
ok
drinker
too
hoppy
for
my
tastes
but
a
great
try
for
the
hop
heads
d
its
good
drinking
but
probably
shouldnt
be
considered
an
amber
was
talking
to
the
bartender
and
they
apparently
qualify
it
as
an
irish
red
id
say
that
would
be
a
little
more
apt
watery
finish
and
barely
noticeable
carrythrough
very
dry
finish
leaving
me
with
a
bit
of
an
overroasted
grain
dryness
d
okay
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
bland
to
want
a
second
d
the
flavor
was
good
bit
some
times
overwhelming
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
occassion
but
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
or
every
week
d
i
probably
wouldnt
reach
for
another
right
away
poured
a
clear
deep
amberred
color
with
a
good
34
of
bubbly
offwhite
head
good
lacing
smells
are
of
very
grainy
malts
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
tastes
very
sweet
and
malty
like
caramel
and
bread
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
a
very
sessionable
amber
ale
to
enjoy
while
at
lancaster
brewing
d
the
abv
is
reasonable
low
even
and
the
flavors
are
strong
enough
that
id
belly
up
for
a
few
more
d
not
my
favorite
beer
from
lancaster
more
of
a
palate
cleanser
it
lacks
what
i
consider
drinkable
qualities
too
much
gas
and
it
a
long
while
for
the
malt
to
even
grace
my
tastebuds
i
will
skip
this
in
the
future
this
arrived
with
a
decent
bonewhite
head
that
had
decent
retention
throughout
the
color
was
rustred
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
was
lightly
sweet
with
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thin
and
had
a
mild
hoppiness
to
go
along
with
the
sweetness
the
finish
was
mildly
bitter
but
it
also
had
enough
sweetness
to
keep
the
malt
set
happy
this
was
another
red
which
did
not
overwhelm
me
with
its
sweetness
i
may
have
to
rethink
my
stance
on
red
ales
as
a
result
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
12
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
tame
pale
and
light
crystal
malt
scent
it
seems
a
bit
grainy
it
has
a
mild
hop
aroma
that
really
rounds
out
the
nose
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
light
malty
flavor
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
again
there
is
a
grainy
element
but
nothing
too
bad
the
hops
are
light
but
welcome
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
a
decent
amber
ale
its
light
and
easy
drinking
nothing
too
complicated
an
ok
beer
but
there
are
better
beers
at
the
brewpub
to
select
from
this
is
an
easydrinking
red
ale
and
by
easydrinking
i
mean
its
smooth
but
lacks
much
flavor
i
think
theres
a
little
bit
of
crisp
and
spicy
hops
but
it
mostly
throws
off
an
otherwise
creamy
mouthfeel
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
killians
irish
red
even
thought
thats
a
lager
oh
well
d
a
good
beer
all
around
balanced
well
the
celtic
rose
has
made
its
debut
and
its
kind
of
interesting
it
tastes
somewhat
like
the
red
rose
although
i
admit
its
been
quite
a
while
since
i
had
a
pint
matter
o
fact
it
even
looks
a
little
like
the
red
rose
check
it
out
new
batch
on
tap
so
i
love
regular
new
castle
but
this
werewolf
was
horrible
i
had
to
chase
it
with
other
drinks
to
get
it
down
and
struggled
to
pawn
it
off
it
reminded
me
of
old
coffee
grounds
mixed
with
old
beer
and
dark
hops
just
horrible
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
while
i
would
have
liked
some
more
flavor
overall
i
have
no
major
complaints
from
the
bottle
in
their
branded
glass
appearance
is
a
translucent
reddishbrown
with
a
hefty
head
slightly
fruity
smell
and
starts
with
a
sweet
taste
eventually
going
to
bitter
which
saves
it
since
i
dont
like
sweet
brews
feels
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
bite
i
usually
dont
like
strong
aftertastes
but
its
not
bad
here
overall
pretty
good
for
a
seasonal
and
a
nice
change
from
newcastle
brown
which
i
like
alot
very
poor
beer
not
a
good
effort
this
was
a
nice
surprise
for
me
a
little
darker
than
newcastle
brown
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
less
enjoyable
experience
drinking
a
beer
the
aroma
was
a
tad
on
the
earthy
side
for
me
with
a
distinct
hint
of
dirt
however
the
real
fireworks
arrived
upon
the
first
sip
with
a
powerful
initial
burst
of
flavor
i
generally
try
to
be
more
flowery
in
my
descriptions
but
the
taste
of
this
beer
can
only
be
compared
to
that
of
saddle
sweat
i
would
suggest
trying
it
if
only
for
the
novelty
of
experiencing
the
worst
beer
youve
ever
tasted
i
try
and
find
something
i
like
about
every
beer
this
one
was
hard
to
do
that
this
was
one
of
worst
things
or
ever
put
in
my
mouth
two
drinks
was
all
i
could
get
down
before
pouring
the
rest
down
the
sink
terrible
does
not
stand
out
above
other
newcastles
definitely
a
halloween
beer
not
something
i
will
get
again

c
decent
session
brew
albeit
a
bit
watery
overall
the
solvent
aspect
takes
a
lot
away
from
a
beer
that
had
potential
pours
a
nice
red
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
last
long
but
leaves
nice
lacing
taste
is
somewhat
like
a
light
caramel
that
hints
at
something
darker
and
richer
but
never
shows
its
face
disappointing
smell
is
typical
of
most
british
ales
has
a
lighter
mouthfeel
and
is
relatively
refreshing
overall
this
is
something
id
drink
without
complaint
but
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
myself
cheers
i
miss
the
old
beer
advocate
very
much
a
british
beer
style
very
tasty
beer
and
one
i
would
have
again
this
beer
was
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
blind
pig
mug
and
enjoyed
at
apx
55f
tastes
of
sweet
malt
copper
a
little
spicy
and
soapy
watery
on
the
palate
with
copper
aftertaste
crazy
red
brown
look
and
decent
head
starts
very
smooth
with
a
very
slight
berry
taste
half
way
though
you
get
a
almost
tart
bite
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
rather
plain
offering
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
but
nothing
offensive
just
ok
will
not
revisit
nice
clean
taste
of
a
darker
ale
can
taste
a
bread
and
caramel
taste
in
the
finish
i
was
a
good
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
around
my
mid
beer
snob
friends
and
family
a
bit
let
down
some
carmel
notes
but
not
much
else

a
deep
amber

with
light
beige
small
head

rapidly
and
leaves
a
tracing
of

some
mild

of

in

for
a

evening
smooth

o

goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
beer
was
somewhat
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
although
there
are
better
options
within
the
style
this
beer
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
pours
a
beautiful
brown
seethrough
aroma
is
light
with
sweet
malts
taste
is
ok
with
malt
prevelance
and
a
little
bread
there
is
a
overpowering
doughy
bread
taste
as
it
goes
on
overall
ok
balance
but
seems
a
touch
heavy
on
the
cool
sweetness
pours
a
dark
brownish
red
color
with
an
offwhite
head
with
solid
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
plums
raisins
and
dark
bread
the
taste
is
very
sweet
up
front
with
a
good
dose
of
malts
and
slightly
toasted
grain
and
a
lingering
sweetness
well
into
the
finish
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
the
sweetness
is
overpowering
for
my
taste
buds
would
have
prefered
a
drier
finish
to
this
one
im
sure
its
vogue
to
pan
this
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
rather
flavorful
and
a
decent
macro
brewed
irish
red
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
typical
of
an
irish
red
little
to
no
head
and
minute
lacing
after
ten
minutes
the
aroma
is
pretty
disatisfying
consisting
of
mainly
malt
and
smokiness
though
some
sugarybuttery
aromas
come
through
as
it
warms
the
taste
wasnt
much
better
with
first
mouth
feel
tasting
mainly
of
malt
with
an
after
taste
of
crisp
bread
mouth
feel
was
very
light
but
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
nothing
id
recommend
overall
had
this
at
a
tasting
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
nothing
about
the
flavor
or
aroma
was
appealing
i
wish
i
had
notes
to
refer
back
to
other
than
a
number
rating
so
i
could
recall
what
about
this
specifically
was
so
hideous
but
i
recall
it
being
very
unpleasant
overall
3
88
yes
this
is
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
it
is
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
and
it
is
not
bashful
in
its
flavor
the
faint
at
heart
will
probably
gawk
and
make
faces
but
this
beer
is
rich
in
taste
and
has
a
lot
going
for
it
i
highly
recommend
the
werewolf
werewolf
pours
a
brownish
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
there
is
a
very
weak
aroma
some
salty
peanut
notes
the
flavor
is
pronounced
big
hazelnut
flavors
and
a
stale
malt
flavor
the
body
is
a
bit
watery
but
flavors
are
still
there

its

newcastle
werewolf
is
brown
in
color
with
a
slight
reddish
hue
to
it
i
personally
didnt
notice
much
of
a
smell
at
all
and
i
took
some
pretty
deep
whiffs
upon
trying
it
the
first
thought
that
came
to
mind
was
this
is
probably
what
gutter
water
taste
like
having
had
a
pitcher
the
first
pint
of
werewolf
was
pretty
brutal
to
get
through
but
by
the
second
id
become
immune
to
the
taste
werewolf
is
slightly
carbonated
but
feels
very
flat
it
really
does
taste
like
dirty
water
overall
werewolf
is
good
not
great
and
is
a
decent
addition
to
the
rotating
seasonal
lineup
from
newcastle
mouthfeel
is
watery
overall
its
an
ok
beer
o
overall
an
odd
little
beer
a
little
off
i
could
see
it
appealing
to
a
broader
audience
but
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
yo
thiz
iz
madd
real
yo
as
is
my
wont
i
employed
an
aggro
pour
allowing
it
to
flow
freely
out
of
the
bottle
which
in
turn
began
a
pseudocascade
that
produced
three
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
great
retention
i
would
put
the
color
more
as
deepcopper

as
opposed
to

up
a
cartloads
of
this
brew
as
it
was
on

special
price

a

was

did
my

lets
give

a
nice
zesty
roasted
malt
smell
pours
into
a
trusty
pint
to
a
deep
bronze
with
a
two

head
the
taste
starts
with
a
nice
hop
bite
the
phases
into
a
sweet
yet
tangy
malt
base
then
transitions
to
a
gradually
sweeter
finish
with
a
broad
robust
yet
zesty
bitterness
fading
in
the
background
a
very

brew
i
will
purchase
again
as
well
as

that
is

rjt
appearance
was
a

dark
amber
not
much
carbonation
small
head
smell
was
malty
with
some
caramel
notes
not
bad
was
looking
forward
to
this
but
then
not
a
whole
lot
of
taste
up
front
very
light
despite
the
abv
moreso
in
the
aftertaste
malty
not
much
else
i
was
actually
quite
let
down
by
this
one
may
try
again
in
the
future
orang
red
in
the
color
there
was
a
small
head
at
the
table
not
sure
what
it
looked
like
at
the
tap
little
to
no
lacing
can
be
seen
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sweet
the
taste
has
a
lots
of
malt
carmel
a
hint
of
bread
dough
and
a
light
bitter
after
taste
what
you
would
expect
in
an
irish
red
i
like
the
sweeter
brews
so
this
was
fine
in
my
eyes
apart
from
actually
looking
at
it
its
fine
enough
but
im
not
in
love
with
it
overall
a
really
good
irish
red
deeply
malted
caramel
flavors
but
not
overly
sweet
fairly
simple
but
delicious
the
feel
is
good
rich
and
thick
fullbodied
especially
for
a
red
with
a
bit
of
a
crisp
bite
and
plenty
of
smoothness
nothing
bad
here
a
decent
sessionable
ale
without
a
lot
of
distinction
its
probably
a
good
drink
for
those
who
are
really
into
the
sweetermaltybiscuty
beers
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
complexity
a
good
beer
for
those
who
like
their
stuff
more
biscuit
and
caramel
rather
than
hoppy
but
balanced
it
is
not
pour
is
almost
like
an
amber
smells
like
overly
dry
cereal
grains
and
it
even
tastes
like
dry
grains
honestly
tastes
like
a
grain
mill
they
didnt
figure
out
balance
in
this
one
its
so
overly
dry
its
hard
to
get
over
its
honestly
not
a
bad
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
all
those
grains
o
i
liked
this
beer
i
want
to
try
it
again
and
since
im
so
close
to
moylans
i
wanted
to
check
out
their
location
thanks
to
swalden28
for
sharing
this
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
redorange
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
toffee
and
earth
with
some
orange
citrus
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
grt
a
lot
of
toffee
and
some
cocoa
as
well
as
some
earth
and
orange
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
nice
drop
easily
sessionable
without
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
taste
was
just
like
the
smell
it
was
elegant
well
balanced
and
distinctly
apricot
flavoured
it
was
an
exceptional
ale
but
i
cant
give
it
an
exceptional
rating
because
of
the
way
it
was
presented
it
was
clearly
not
an
irish
red
ale
as
other
reveiewers
have
mentioned
this
is
not
the
way
an
irish
red
ale
is
meant
to
taste
there
were
too
many
hops
and
that
distinct
fruitiness
is
that
isnt
meant
to
be
an
irish
red
good
beer
though
so
i
have
to
give
it
a
pretty
good
score
o
not
bad
but
probably
not
something
id
drink
on
a
regular
basis
pours

very
easy

ira
thats
very
sessionable
and
probably

again
cheers
overall
i
think
its
different
type
of
beer
low
hop
profile
and
sweet
malts
but
well
put
together
and
drinkable
not
my
style
but
enjoyable
malty
aroma
has
a
fruity
underpinning
and
is
not
strong
but
still
inviting
it
pours
a
clear
ambercopper
with
an
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
long
flavor
has
a
core
of
malt
plus
subtle
fruity
caramel
grassy
and
woody
tones
and
a
whisper
of
honey
sweetness
texture
is
about
average
fairly
smooth
and
gently
fizzy
overall
not
great
but
still
worthy
different
but
only
liked
it
soso
dry
barley
with
more
sweetness
than
bitterness
could
not
drink
very
much
of
this
bomber
reddish
coloured
body
with
one
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
retained
head
a
different
aroma
a
tad
above
average
mouthfeel
lace
sheet
fine
for
what
it
is
interesting
brew
with
some
appealing
scottish
character
that
doesnt
quite
grab
me
seems
to
underachieve
in
complexity
without
compensating
with
particularly
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
nice
consistent
well
brewed
irish
red
ale
that
is
not
overly
true
to
style
but
is
a
quality
beer
that
gives
a
good
different
approach
to
things
taste
bread
up
front
with
a
yeasty
sting
then
a
green
apple
flavor
hits
in
the
back
finishes
dry
with
a
caramel
coating
there
are
good
flavors
in
this
but
something
tastes
a
little
off
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
overall
one
for
the
malty
sweet
drinkers
heading
towards
some
slight
cloying
stickiness
i
would
prefer
a
skosh
less
sweetness
and
alcohol
just
a
skosh
mind
you
appearance
is
a
nice
copper
tone
with
1
finger
of
head
dannys
irish
red
smells
of
grains
and
malts
mostly
some
hops
taking
a
sip
and
the
taste
has
some
light
fruits
more
malts
mf
is
medium
and
finishes
bitter
and
dry
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
that
would
pair
well
with
wings
o
this
beer
was
horrible
and
to
think
this
is
a
off
bottle
is
laughable
as
i
have
had
so
many
bottles
from
them
that
taste
the
exact
same
i
think
qc
needs
to
be
looked
at
more
indepth
a
little
more
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
has
sweet
caramel
and
toasted
malts
and
a
little
fruit
too
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
a
somewhat
bready
taste
and
minimal
hops
medium
bodied
solid
mouthfeel
not
something
id
drink
often
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
but
still
a
pretty
decent
red
ale
this
beer
screams
of
mediocrity
there
is
definitely
a
lack
of
balance
as
this
beer
could
have
benefited
from
at
least
a
little
hop
flavoring
the
flavors
that
did
come
through
did
not
stand
out
as
anything
fantastic
i
became
quite
bored
quite
quickly
while
drinking
this
aroma
is
of
light
caramel
roasted
nuts
light
touches
of
butterscotch
like
sugary
notes
warming
brings
out
a
very
earthy
and
pronounced
flavor
to
it
really
nice
done
but
a
touch
light
this
is
my
only
complaint
as
it
did
not
have
the
pop
i
was
really
looking
for
at
the
time
smooth
even
flavor
really
did
not
deviate
much
from
beginning
to
end
as
the
overall
impact
was
nicely
put
together
a
bit
light
on
the
feel
but
this
helped
to
keep
it
very
drinkable
and
the
subtly
sweet
finish
was
the
icing
on
the
cake
o
another
fine
brew
from
moylans
i
have
never
gone
wrong
with
one
of
their
ales
yet
all
have
been
solid
and
some
have
been
spectacular
hopsickle
imperial
stout
and
the
price
is
right
too
d
this
was
like
a
light
scotch
ale
with
malty
but
clean
scent
and
taste
nice
body
too
and
very
easy
to
drink
good
beer
but
nothing
great
drinks
alright
but
not
really
holding
my
interest
about
middle
of
the
pack
for
this
style
not
had
to
many
new
offerings
to
me
from
moylans
lately
that
have
impressed
me
to
be
honest
drinkability
would
be
a
whole
lot
better
if
the
overall
taste
had
some
oomph
to
it
its
not
a
hard
brew
to
drink
just
boring
this
has
some
excellent
flavors
the
malts
really
prevail
it
could
be
ised
as
a
session
brew
as
well
yeah
its
missing
something
i
like
the
light
graininess
and
the
nutty
characters
and
its
light
enough
to
be
quite
drinkable
for
a
beer
clocking
in
above
session
strength
but
theres
something
too
light
too
dumbed
down
about
it
for
me
to
really
enjoy
it
tasty
enough
but
something
ill
probably
forget
pretty
quickly
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
this
beer
is
a
deep
reddishamber
color
with
a
colossal
head
worthy
of
the
glass
quite
lovely
to
look
at
the
aroma
is
quite
good
as
well
light
caramel
with
bready
melanoidens
modestly
fruity
the
taste
is
appropriate
for
the
style
fairly
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
toastiness
to
the
breadlike
flavor
rather
estery
bitterness
is
low
and
no
hop
flavor
is
to
be
found
the
body
is
a
tad
watery
which
i
count
the
only
real
flaw
drinkability
is
very
good
tasty
perfectly
balanced
and
with
a
reasonable
abv
showing
no
hints
of
alcohol
nice
beer
drinkability
a
tad
too
sweet
for
my
tastebuds
but
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
not
exceptional
but
still
a
very
good
american
attempt
at
an
irish
red
id
pick
it
up
again
d
its
a
nice
irish
red
ale
tasty
and
well
balanced
definitely
worth
a
try
for
red
ale
fans
medium
body
and
carbonation
pretty
refreshing
overall
this
isnt
incredibly
exciting
but
it
is
fairly
drinkable
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
one
bomber
is
enjoyable
but
i
dont
know
that
this
is
something
id
want
more
than
every
once
in
a
while
mouthfeel
heavy
syrup
in
the
cheeks
and
throat
grab
a
slice
of
bread
or
some
cheese
or
some
water
anything
to
combat
the
syrup
blitz
taste
is
a
bit
fruity
and
buttery
to
be
considered
a
clean
malty
red
ale
the
peat
that
i
noticed
in
the
nose
carries
on
into
the
flavor
and
contributes
more
to
the
unclean
feel
of
this
beer
i
am
not
getting
much
caramel
sweetness
which
usually
is
a
trademark
of
the
style
body
is
a
touch
on
the
light
side
and
the
abv
is
well
hidden
hoppy
bitterness
creeps
in
on
the
finish
but
really
does
not
contribute
much
overall
i
cant
think
of
too
many
positive
traits
for
dannys
irish
style
red
ale
and
at
nearly
5
bucks
a
bomber
i
can
say
with
certainty
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
average
at
best
d
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
much
rather
have
a
six
pack
of
this
instead
of
a
bomber
but
hey
with
our
beer
selection
beggars
cant
be
choosers
pours
a
strong
reddish
color
body
average
foamy
creamy
offwhite

lasting
very
malty
aroma
strong

nuttiness
enticing
malty
irish

very
light
nutty

very
irish
ale
tasting
good
and
malty
d
again
its
a
delicious
caramelmalty
irish
red
ale
not
an
impressive
appearance
or
aroma
but
it
delivers
on
taste
d
i
would
say
this
a
good
beer
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
see
myself
enjoying
this
with
some
peanuts
watching
some
sports
on
tv
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
bomber
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
pumpkin
flesh
orange
color
with
a
thick
fluffy
tan
head
that
sticks
around
wonderfully
aroma
is
sweet
grains
and
a
little
bit
of
tangy
hop
presence
flavor
is
similar
sweet
and
tangy
with
a
sort
of
orangey
note
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
better
than
the
marin
irish
red
by
a
hair
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
good
sized
white
head
with
no
lacing
down
the
glass
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
taste
is
much
the
same
sweetmalty
brown
sugar
taste
up
front
with
a
peatearthy
dry
aftertaste
carbonation
is
right
on
and
beer
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
would
buy
this
again
i
like
i
and
its
smooth
but
its
not
nearly
as
drinkable
as
it
should
be
for
the
lowkey
smoothness
and
isnt
really
a
session
beer
which
is
what
i
think
it
should
be
it
becomes
a
little
tiresome
and
heavy
in
part
because
it
has
a
lot
of
alcohol
for
the
amount
of
flavour
and
complexity
you
get
for
this
level
of
character
id
go
with
many
other
beers
that
have
a
lot
less
alcohol
while
for
the
alcohol
id
go
with
beers
with
a
lot
more
interest
and
character
not
a
bad
amber
ale
overall
i
personally
prefer
more
hop
flavor
as
it
balances
out
the
amber
malts
the
flavors
from
the
barley
and
malts
however
blended
well
for
a
smack
you
in
the
face
flavor
this
was
a
22oz
cant
see
myself
wanting
to
drink
more
back
to
back
d
very
drinkable
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
a
good
example
one
i
wont
dream
about
but
may
enjoy
down
the
road
a
nice
changeup
to
the
super
hoppy
beers
i
love
the
moylans
brewery
but
this
is
unfortunately
not
one
of
my
favorites
a
good
irish
red
better
than
the
massprodcued
imported
brands
we
get
in
the
states
way
drinkable
and
then
some
yum
overall
its
a
decent
red
ale
but
too
sweet
for
my
liking
d
havent
had
a
beer
of
this
style
in
a
long
time
so
it
was
nice
to
go
back
fresh
and
tasty
i
enjoyed
this
pint
the
bottle
overflowed
upon
opening
and
it
was
not
shaken
malt
and
sherry
aroma
red
and
auburn
in
color
again
lots
of
brewers
yeast
with
this
brand
taste
is
smooth
chunky
malty
and
sweet
with
bit
of
bitterness
aftertaste
has
something
kind
of
skunky
could
be
the
yeast
this
was
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
d
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
not
much
character
to
this
beer
from
a
22
oz
bottle
purchased
locally
aroma
is
malty
and
plumy
appearance
is
a
cloudy
red
with
a
tiny
tan
head
taste
is
malty
more
of
the
plummy
notes
from
the
crystal
malt
a
little
roast
in
the
background
im
getting
some
funky
notes
in
the
malt
wet
cardboard
and
a
little
stale
tasting
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
very
little
carbonation
this
has
to
be
one
bad
bottle
because
ive
never
had
a
clunker
from
moylans
before
good
drinkability
though
nothing
to
overpowering
and
overall
its
wellbalanced
ruddy
rusty
woodstain
like
amber
but
not
much
of
a
head
or
any
bubbling
great
color
color
though
ambrosia
golden
toasted
barely
grains
glide
into
the
nostrils
mixing
with
some
light
caramel
and
minty
hop
notes
the
taste
has
subtle
yet
undeniable
flavors
abounding
heavy
breads
with
some
caramel
and
honey
faintly
drizzled
on
top
a
little
buttery
on
the
paate
but
the
faint
mint
and
pine
hops
cuts
through
the
malt
butter
flavor
a
bit
screams
round
after
round
at
ye
olde
pube
not
a
typo
overall
probably
wont
pick
it
up
again
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
either
i
enjoyed
this
beer
didnt
knock
me
out
but
definitely
a
beer
worth
drinking
not
everything
can
be
a
kilt
lifter
i
suppose
i
had
it
after
dinner
and
thought
it
fit
well
got
slightly
syrupy
towards
the
end
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
red
ale
this
beer
will
not
disappoint
went
great
with
my
dinner
and
im
sure
it
would
with
most
anyones
great
flavor
and
a
nice
drinker
the
abv
and
cost
is
a
little
high
to
make
this
a
session
beer
recommend
this
highly
for
the
style
good
low
key
carbonation
its
not
as
smooth
as
kilkenny
on
nitro
and
not
as
fizzy
as
smithwicks
even
at
6
8
very
sessionable
and
the
best
irish
red
ive
had
even
if
it
is
from
california
a
great
example
of
the
style
you
see
this
bottle
you
drink
whats
inside
it
d
i
could
seriously
drink
this
any
time
any
day
great
beer
the
best
irish
red
i
have
ever
had
ever
d
exceptional
the
best
irish

highly
recommend
this
beer
to
people

is
quite
balanced
between

and
toasted
maltiness
its
a
good
blend
just
a
titch
of

hops
arent
detectable
only
around
for
a
little
countering
effect
if
anything
a
bit
dry

the
finish
highly
quaffable
and
tasty
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
with
a
light
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
cap
somewhat
strange
herbal
and
malty
aromas
that
are
a
little
light
the
taste
is
surprisingly
bland
there
is
some
dry
malt
some
faint
fruitiness
and
some
faint
bitterness
but
the
flavors
all
sort
of
cancel
each
other
out
not
bad
but
pretty
neutral
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
the
malt
starts
to
grow
a
bit
as
i
warms
up
but
its
not
too
sweet
not
terrible
just
a
misses

mark

overall
a
very
good

why
this

called
irish

whatever
i
like
this

d
i
split
a
750ml
and
that
was
enough
i
wont

is
ok

i
would

in
a
better

cm

i
enjoyed

i
drank
it
from
a
24oz
bottle
and
if
id
had
two
of
them
id
have
cracked
open
the
second
and
gotten
piss
drunk
to
be
sure
drinkability
i
really
liked
this
version
of
the
style
and
ive
yet
to
have
a
moylans
brew
which
didnt
impress
me
i
paid
around
4
for
the
bomber
and
at
6
5
abv
the
buzz
is
very
euphoric
and
present
at
the
end
without
the
alcohol
making
itself
known
in
the
taste
and
though
its
complex
its
balanced
and
doesnt
lean
too
far
over
to
the
malt
side
which
for
me
throws
a
lot
of
reds
offkilter
and
makes
many
too
derivative
i
could
drink
much
more
of
this
and
if
its
ever
in
6packs
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
staple
for
the
spring
d
pretty
good
for
an
irish
red
it
isnt
something
id
have
again
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
irish
reds
color
was
a
deep
ruby
hazy
with
a
minimal
tan
head
subdued
nose
some
roasty
caramel
vague
fruit
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
noted
taste
was
caramel
and
toffeeish
sweet
malts
minimal
hop
presences
finished
sweet
almost
rich
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
very
lightly
carbonated
viscous
decent
but
nothing
special
pours
a
great
redburnished
copper
color
with
a
nice
foamy
head
and
wonderful
lacing
has
a
nice
malty
and
sour
scent
not
really
citrus
sour
but
tangy
nice
taste
a
very
nice
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
cherry
and
something
a
little
burnt
but
not
as
much
sourness
as
a
red
from
ireland
goes
down
very
smoothly
a
little
on
the
thick
side
for
a
beer
relatively
low
in
alcohol
there
is
still
a
bit
of
warmth
to
be
felt
hops
are
in
the
background
and
only
tasted
as
the
beer
slides
down
the
back
of
the
tongue
on
its
way
to
a
happy
belly
a
malty
somewhat
sweet
beer
d
my
only
complaint
is
that
it
doesnt
come
in
a
6pack
that
i
know
of
drinkability
overall
definitely
a
pretty
tasty
brew
at
6
5
its
not
chugable
but
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
is
very
approachable
i
actually
find
myself
drinking
this
faster
than
usual
glad
i
brought
a
bomber
home
oelergud
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
and
again
an
attractive
copper
color
a
thin
offwhite
head
an
aroma
of
caramel
malt
butterscotch
and
pears
a
caramel
and
biscuit
flavor
somewhat
sweet
but
balanced
with
hops
to
dry
it
out
on
the
finish
a
pleasing
medium
body
with
a
lightly
nutty
and
caramel
finish
a
well
made
beer
that
screams
october
though
nobody
knows
what
october
means
in
novato
the
moutfeel
is
medium
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
even
in
large
amounts
the
dry
finish
helps
to
keep
the
beer
refreshing
this
is
definitely
a
wellconceived
and
executed
beer
d
i
just
saw
a
show
where
a
person
was
filmed
on
the
7
day
guinness
diet
i
volunteer
to
be
the
first
to
do
the
moylanss
seven
day
dannys
irish
style
red
ale
diet
i
highly
recommend
the
beer
pours
forth
from
the
22
ounce
bottle
an
reddish
orange
with
a
demonstrative
creamy
white
head
that
upon
its
erosion
leaves
a
velum
like
coating
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
has
a
sour
dough
earthiness
somewhat
sweet
with
a
grassy
tone
hints
of
oranges
caramel
also
peek
though
the
maze
start
has
a
decent
malt
presence
mint
like
bitterness
also
present
with
a
touch
top
is
medium
in
feel
finish
has
a
stinging
acidity
the
hops
blatantly
spicy
dry
as
a
bone
aftertaste
sticks
to
the
palate
like
super
glue
quite
drinkable
a
nice
everyday
beer
this
is
a
very
pretty
beer
pours
a
dark
reddishmahogany
with
a
thick
chewy
head
unfortunately
thats
where
my
affinity
ends
for
this
brew
taste
is
excessively
biscuity
reminding
me
of
the
hopelessly
mediocre
new
belgium
fat
tire
very
drinkable
and
goes
well
with
traditional
irish
fare
but
thats
about
it
opened
a
22oz
bottle
last
night
and
it
exploded
with
foam
all
in
the
kitchen
sink
after
the
initial
burst
it
still
was
foaming
like
mad
as
i
poured
it
into
the
glasses
this
beer
was
way
too
overcarbonated
i
must
have
picked
up
a
bad
bottle
i
managed
to
only
salvage
about
half
a
pint
glass
of
beer
each
for
me
and
my
wife
i
figured
we
should
at
least
try
a
sip
or
two
to
see
what
it
tastes
like
actually
it
wasnt
too
bad
it
was
red
colored
obviously
but
had
a
nice
apple
flavor
aspect
to
it
a
bit
better
than
i
expected
too
bad
that
we
were
only
able
to
have
about
4
oz
each
as
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
irish
reds
to
begin
with
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
one
let
me
down
lightly
full
medium
body
here
it
is
still
fairly
sweet
with
that
ampd
up
berry
character
here
in
the
flavor
toasted
biscuit
malt
notes
are
evident
up
front
and
there
is
a
touch
of
dark
grain
astringency
in
the
finish
though
i
wouldnt
say
there
is
any
roast
character
here
lots
of
caramelized
crystal
malt
character
here
this
brew
is
practically
definite
by
it
the
hops
play
a
supporting
role
here
most
noticeable
as
a
light
to
nipping
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
there
is
also
a
nice
herbal
hop
flavor
here
as
well
there
is
an
almost
saccharine
quality
to
the
berrysweetness
in
the
finish
here
not
sure
what
is
giving
the
beer
this
taste
but
it
is
a
touch
distracting
at
times
still
this
is
mostly
a
really
nice
malty
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
and
great
for
those
who
like
the
malt
focused
equivalent
of
a
pale
ale
well
i
believe
this
is
where
moylan
comes
in
the
color
is
almost
ruby
aroma
is
very
deep
and
pleasing
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
crystal
malt
and
clean
hop
finish
mouthfeel
was
almost
a
5
but
as
good
as
this
was
i
want
to
live
in
a
world
where
the
best
is
yet
to
come
if
i
havent
said
it
enough
times
this
is
a
great
brew
nice
reddish
color
with
a
great
head
on
top
ho
hum
aromametallic
and
coppery
like
malt
flavor
dominates
with
a
slight
bitter
bite
to
it
slight
bready
taste
to
it
metallic
notes
from
the
aroma
comes
thru
smooth
and

up
for
the
bite
it
tends
to
have
a
notch
above
average
thanks
to
beerrun13
for
this
suprise
package
a
superb
malt
showcase
not
sure
why
it
doesnt
rate
better
maybe
its
especially
sensitive
to
age
and
old
samples
are
out
there
pours
into
my
pint
glass
with
a
rich
dark
reddish
amber
if
thats
a
possible
color
and
is
crowned
nicely
with
an
offwhite
head
owning
lingering
tints
of
burnt
orange
the
beer
itself
had
a
rather
mild
smell
but
hints
of
sweet
malt
and
caramel
find
their
way
through
this
ale
had
a
very
low
hop
presence
i
like
that
however
giving
way
to
mild
malt
and
meandering
honey
notes
finishing
clean
yet
sweet
a
nice
medium
body
although
probably
a
bit
to
much
to
be
considered
a
session
brew
pairs
great
with
yep
corned
beef
and
cabbage
throw
in
a
few
slices
of
rye
bread
and
spin
the
irish
pub
tunes
enjoy
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
ruby
red
with
a
medium
head
that
disapates
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
is
pretty
strong
and
different
vanilla
grape
sweet
malt
make
this
an
interesting
smelling
beer
the
taste
is
creamy
and
wine
like
sweet
malt
some
hops
and
mostly
dark
fruit
and
grapes
make
this
a
very
different
red
ale
the
mf
is
light
with
a
combination
of
flavors
that
dont
reallt
go
well
together
not
horriblebut
this
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
if
you
like
very
fruity
beers
this
may
be
for
youotherwise
try
another
red
ale
d
maybe
i
let
this
sit
a
bit
too
long
possibly
a
bit
more
crisp
when
fresh
d
i
like
this
a
lot
wish
i
could
get
it
here
love
the
dry
finish
also
had
a
bit
bigger
body
than
most
moylans
nice
caramel
chewiness
going
on
after
you
swallow
notes
ehhhh
not
for
me
but
not
a
complete
dissaster
by
any
stretch
soft
malty
brews
have
a
place
and
i
do
like
them
but
they
havent
to
have
a
hook
and
this
was
rather
blah
1
and
done
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
weak
14
beige
head
above
the
reddish
amber
brew
head
is
gone
in
a
flash
very
disappointing
for
the
style
leaving
just
a
film
and
a
few
odd
bubbles
here
and
there
some
lacing
present
aroma
is
lightly
of
sweet
caramel
malts
taste
is
reasonably
wellbalanced
with
grain
husks
balanced
by
the
sedate
hops
character
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
chalkygrainy
and
lacking
in
the
carbonation
department
but
it
goes
down
pretty
well
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
overall
impression
very
drinkable
beer
better
than
most
reds
but
nothing
outstanding
overall
ive
never
been
a
big
irish
red
fan
but
this
one
was
pretty
decent
good
caramel
malt
and
fruit
aroma
taste
was
a
touch
grainy
and
dry
with
some
nutty
caramel
flavours
some
citrus
flavours
too
medium
bodied
good
drinkability
after
taste
is
dry
and
a
touch
astringent
ok
beer
but
probably
wont
have
again
drinkable
however
not
my
type
of
red
this
beer
opened
with
a
huge
burst
i
expected
to
see
a
big
eruption
from
the
bottle
but
none
came
forth
it
pours
a
nice
deep
amber
color
with
an
incredible
head
that
really
gets
in
the
way
of
the
pour
the
nose
is
nice
deep
caramel
and
slighty
citrusy
oreangey
quality
there
is
also
a
peppery
spiceyness
as
well
the
flavor
is
more
orangey
citrusy
than
the
nose
its
not
bad
at
all
the
spiceypeppery
character
is
there
just
before
the
finish
but
fades
fast
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
to
meduim
carbonation
overall
i
do
enjoy
this
one
tapmoylans
brewpub
under
the
name
paddys
irish
red
sweet
nuttytoffee
flavours
with
a
watery
texture
dont
really
like
the
style
much
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
nothing
much
happening
in
the
flavour
or
body
department
pretty
soft
smooth
palate
i
guess
22
ounce
bottle
an
easy
drinking
mellow
brew
highly
recommended
quite
red
in
color
with
a
medium
tightly
packed
offwhite
head
aroma
is
malty
with
strong
caramel
notes
caramel
comes
through
strong
in
the
flavor
as
well
where
it
picks
up
some
light
fruity
notes
midpalate
a
moderate
hop
bite
in
the
finish
and
an
aftertaste
which
has
a
rich
molasses
flavor
theres
a
bit
of
smokiness
in
there
too
which
could
stand
to
be
accentuated
as
it
stands
the
flavor
is
overall
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
mediumfull
bodied
and
drinkable
enough
but
not
the
best
this
brewery
has
to
offer
red
gold
color
medium
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
slightly
hopped
mildly
roasted

light

the

nice
flavor
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
malty
no
bitterness
nice
beer
very
drinkable
on
a
warm
summer
day
the
head
foams
up
like
a
wave
breaking
on
the
northern
california
shore
in
a
nasty
winter
storm
after
a
fairly
careful
pour
i
was
left
with
a
good
four
inches
of
foam
the
head
remained
at
14
to
12
inch
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
color
is
a
very
attractive
red
with
a
hint
of
copper
caramel
is
noticeable
in
the
smell
with
just
a
slight
bit
of
hops
backing
it
up
as
others
have
noticed
this
stuff
goes
down
like
water
especially
at
6
5
abv
very
enjoyable
its
only
drawback
is
that
it
lacks
a
hop
bite
in
the
finish
for
a
red
ale
but
you
may
well
forget
that
after
16
of
these
in
my
quest
to
join
the
mug
club
i
had
this
beer
at
moylans
today
instead
of
some
of
their
better
offerings
color
was
a
deep
red
and
the
head
and
lace
were
nice
taste
was
interesting
and
i
could
not
pinpoint
what
it
was
overall
a
very
smooth
brew
that
would
be
a
decent
session
ale
hazy
reddish
amber
in
hue
w
a
quickly
dissapating
off
white
head
sweet
ripe
fruit
esters
smells
like
starfruit
nutty
malt
dark
caramel
and
a
touch
of
roasted
barley
in
aroma
w
a
floral
and
somewhat
spicy
hop
nose
the
overall
aroma
is
quite
odd
yet
somewhat
enticing
flavorwise
this
beer
is
an
interesting
mix
of
fruity
esters
and
assertive
caramel
sweetness
although
sweet
upfront
hop
and
roasted
grain
bitterness
surfaces
late
w
lightly
tart
yeast
derived
flavors
perceptible
as
well
the
body
is
a
touch
thin
unfortunately
leaving
the
mouthfeel
slightly
weak
the
goldings
hop
flavor
is
akin
to
damp
flowers
finishes
w
biscuit
notes
and
light
but
more
fruitiness
lingering
this
is
one
strange
brew
the
esters
are
odd
and
perhaps
a
bit
too
dominant
the
flavor
components
dont
seems
to
coalesce
here
that
being
said
i
found
myself
readily
drinking
this
due
to
its
oddity
in
flavor
moylans
irish
red
is
worth
a
try
but
im
unsure
if
id
purchase
it
again
draft
at
the
brewpub
another
exceptional
beer
from
moylans
nice
deep
amber
color
with
a
tanreddish
head
that
stays
up
nicely
you
expect
lots
of
carmel
malt
sweetness
and
you
get
it
both
in
the
smell
and
taste
also
some
earthy
roasted
smells
very
big
malt
flavors
rich
sweet
and
creamy
just
a
touch
of
late
hops
again
reminds
you
its
moylans
i
could
see
this
as
meal
in
itself
but
combined
with
a
snowy
cold
day
roast
beef
and
mashed
potatos
this
would
make
for
grinning
belly
rubbing
heaven
another
on
of
moylans
22oz
bottles
i
carried
over
2500
miles
home
hayward
abbey
rating
74
respectable
red
worth
a
try
if
you
like
a
malty
brew
with
a
kicked
up
abv
picked
up
a
bomber
of
this
for
4
99
red
ales
have
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
and
this
beer
doesnt
change
that
pours
a
nice
dark
red
color
great
mouthfeel
and
caramel
malt
backbone
with
just
a
perfect
mix
of
hoppiness
great
all
around
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
and
easy
and
finishes
clean
for
its
higher
abv
it
really
drinks
way
too
easy
the
heavy
seas
line
has
been
surprisingly
good
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
this
beer
will
not
overwhelm
your
palate
nor
will
it
grab
your
nose
by
the
balls
and
squeeze
it
can
be
described
as
a
moderate
selection
from
the
boys
in
halethorpethe
baltimore
suburb
that
is
home
to
the
brewery
yet
it
is
a
decent
quaff
that
possesses
a
strange
crispness
amid
a
nicely
stuctured
body
of
malt
nice
brew
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
irish
reds
ive
had
its
well
balanced
easily
drinkable
and
offers
more
flavor
than
im
used
to
for
the
style
o
a
solid
brew
would
like
to
try
some
others
in
this
style
o
i
like
this
beer
its
very
drinkable
and
predominantly
biscuity
i
would
have
another
totally
recommended
the
whole
mutiny
fleet
is
worthwhile
a
nice
above
average
beer
that
was
highly
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
still
well
done
and
good
enough
that
i
enjoyed
the
whole
bomber
tasting
the
beer
up
front
there
are
the
maplesyrup
and
brown
sugar
notes
in
the
middle
grainy
tastes
and
malt
switches
the
palette
at
the
end
a
light
bitterness
finishes
this
very
drinkable
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
but
heavy
seas
certainly
made
better
ones
i
was
dubious
about
the
classification
of
this
expecting
it
to
be
an
american
red
but
yeah
its
not
hoppy
enough
and
to
be
honest
its
not
very
interesting
at
all
very
average
a
dark
maple
syrup
color
with
a
decent
light
oatmeal
colored
head
this
brew
also
shows
a
very
solid
lacing
the
aroma
gives
off
punky
cider
malt
even
a
nice
hint
of
juniper
or
something
sort
of
minty
almost
the
flavor
at
room
temperature
is
much
like
the
aroma
except
deeper
and
better
i
get
cider
and
peat
haystack
herbal
sweetness
i
really
like
this
taste
and
its
very
drinkable
for
an
imperial
brew
at
only
7
percent
abv
theres
maple
syrup
and
brown
bread
ideas
here
nice
stuff
in
a
medium
light
brew
with
nice
fine
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
aqueous
feel
strong
inviting
aroma
is
malty
yeasty
and
spicy
with
just
a
whiff
of

none

persistent

flavor
has
spicy
and
earthy
tones
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
texture
is
very
smooth
but
has
a
respectable
tingle
to
it
aaaargh
matey
glad
to
have
tried
it
and
certainly
cannot
say
this
is
a
bad
beer
it
just
not
the
most
exciting
beer
ive
ever
had
then
again
red
ales
never
have
been
one
of
my
string
favorites
thin
head
less
than
a
finger
of
deep
tan
foam
mixture
of
bubble
sizes
dissipates
with
ease
the
lacing
is
wispy
however
sticks
in
fairly
wide
streaks
deep
amber
red
color
with
a
mild
metallic
orange
tinge
at
the
glass
a
few
meandering
bubbles
as
well
as
tiny
particulate
matter
while
the
nose
has
a
hoppy
spine
of
grass
herbs
and
pepper
it
mostly
expresses
chocolate
cake
crumbs
carob
caramel
and
grilled
nuts
soft
touch
of
fig
cherry
blackberry
fruit
scents
not
especially
citrusy
nor
flowery
fullbodied
the
carbonation
may
be
too
fine
to
do
more
than
lift
it
just
off
the
tongue
tends
to
layer
itself
on
the
palate
does
have
a
slight
mineral
water
aspect
to
balance
out
the
caramel
butterscotch
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
candy
aspects
never
gets
excessively
sweet
although
youre
unlikely
to
call
it
dry
too
here
you
get
a
clearer
expression
of
white
grapefruit
to
orange
citrus
challah
bread
scone
and
lower
nuttiness
any
toast
or
roast
kept
well
in
check
fig
apricot
peach
cherry
fruit
not
as
dark
as
delivered
in
the
nose
keeps
that
peppery
bite
especially
at
the
end
for
its
weight
has
good
drinkability
maybe
suffers
from
not
taking
more
chances
at
forging
a
distinctive
personality
overall
reminds
me
a
lot
of
smithwicks
and
i
dont
really
taste
the
higher
abv
good
effort
by
heavy
seas
the
taste
begins
with
a
lot
of
the
same
toasted
and
bready
malty
grains
caramels
toffee
sweetness
as
it
warms
there
is
some
light
earthy
almost
metallic
bitterness
which
is
rather
unpleasant
to
be
honest
the
finish
is
pleasantly
dry
with
some
detection
of
mineral
water
flavors
which
adds
a
nice
dryness
overall
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
or
seek
out
because
of
the
generic
flavors
especially
because
of
the
unnecessarily
high
abv
which
inhibits
further
consumption
if
im
consuming
something
over
6
abv
it
needs
flavor
which
this
is
lacking
o
overall
a
good
red
ale
that
is
heavy
on
the
toasted
and
caramel
malts
worth
trying
if
you
like
red
ales
pours
a
clean
copper
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
faint
small
maltiness
in
the
taste
a
small
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
watery
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
hint
of
caramel
in
the
aftertaste
quite
mellow
and
watery
eh
label
sold
me
on
it
overall
this
beer
isnt
as
dry
as
many
in
the
style
but
the
robustness
of
the
malt
flavors
makes
up
for
that
shortcoming
not
a
traditional
irish
red
but
a
nice
beer
nonetheless
worth
a
shot
an
imperial
irish
redevery
style
is
gonna
get
imperialized
or
barrel
aged
at
some
point
i
think
poured
with
good
clarity
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
deep
bronze
color
with
a
well
defined
one
finger
off
white
head
carame
and
brown
sugar
notes
mainly
in
the
nosethere
is
a
whiff
of
leafy
hop
but
its
not
anything
that
really
jumps
out
sweeter
on
the
palate
then
it
needs
to
bebig
buttery
caramelbrown
sugarand
some
alcohol
sweetnessthe
leafy
hop
presence
is
masked
for
the
most
part
from
the
sweet
malty
flavors
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
like
big
sweeter
malty
alesi
thought
it
was
ok
but
to
one
dimensional
in
its
sweetnessit
can
be
malty
without
being
overly
sweet
pours
a
nice
crimsontinged
amber
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
lacking
with
some
caramel
and
fruity
esters
upfront
along
with
slight
floral
hops
and
biscuit
malt
in
the
backgound
the
taste
is
similar
with
caramel
and
toasted
bread
notes
initially
along
with
some
fruity
esters
and
biscuit
floral
hops
and
a
strong
alcoholic
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
and
oily
and
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
alcohol
presence
decent
red
ale
could
use
more
malt
depth
and
less
evident
alcohol
though
would
give
it
a
third
try
but
not
going
to
hunt
for
it
o
ive
come
to
expect
this
sort
of
good
quality
beer
from
clipper
city
and
they
have
once
again
delivered
with
this
irish
red
quite
enjoyable
and
drinkable
light
copper
with
a
dense
offwhite
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
the
nose
is
malty
with
a
mildly
stale
caramel
malt
along
with
some
hops
it
smells
like
a
blend
of
english
and
american
hops
were
used
here
earthy
and
green
with
some
fruitiness
the
palate
opens
sweet
mildly
chalky
with
some
caramel
and
sugar
sweetness
sweet
on
the
finish
with
soft
carbonation
this
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
with
pine
and
citrus
solid
stuff
it
does
strike
me
that
this
beers
suffering
from
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
shrug
this
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
just
starting
to
drink
craft
beer
who
doesnt
want
to
drink
anything
too
heavy
or
flavorful
d
a
somewhat
memorable
irish
red
in
a
sea
of
otherwise
forgettable
ones
clipper
city
hits
its
trademark
abv
point
of
7
while
ensuring
the
alcohol
never
really
takes
center
stage
nicely
balanced
sweet
and
malty
but
id
skip
on
purchasing
another
pint
or
a
bomber
in
the
future
overall
a
good
red
i
enjoyed
the
blend
of
hops
and
sweetness
it
was
very
well
balanced
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
and
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
one
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
it
had
some
pretty
good
malty
flavors
but
wasnt
overly
sweet
it
went
down
pretty
easy
and
was
an
enjoyable
beer
to
start
off
this
st
patricks
day
evening
the
sweet
caramel
malt
is
also
prominent
upon
first
taste
with
a
rich
grain
flavor
resting
in
the
back
there
is
a
citrushop
finish
that
is
subtle
enough
to
compliment
the
sweet
malt
characteristics
the
beer
is
smooth
overall
and
very
drinkable
though
there
is
nothing
too
complex
about
this
aarsh
ale
it
is
very
enjoyable
especially
on
the
eve
of
st
patricks
day
mouthfeel
drinkability
a
very
easily
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
whole
lot
and
will
pick
up
another
bottle
if
i
see
it
again
in
stores
my
bottles
was
very
fresh
it
was
sort
of
refreshing
to
have
a
red
ale
without
being
overwhlemed
by
sweet
malts
the
sweetness
is
there
it
is
just
perfectly
balanced
with
the
hops
and
ethanol
this
beer
is
definitely
not
an
aarsh
hole
drinkability
this
is
another
decent
offering
from
heavy
seas
their
beers
never
blow
me
away
but
are
almost
never
bad
cheers
d
very

anyone
in

please
consider
this
one
for
your
st

brew
d

beer
but
nothing
too
amazing
pours
a
deep
copper
with
a
fluffy
but
disappointingly
shortlived
hear
the
aroma
is
roasty
with
a
nice
reddish
cherry
edge
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
roasted
like
they
sacrificed
taste
for
color
its
roasted
but
lacks
a
lot
of
deep
malt
flavor
and
the
hops
are
simply
too
light
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
prickly

very
easy
this
bomber
didnt
last
too
long
at
all
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
enough
beer
one
of
the
first
bottles
i
split
with
my
friend
this
past
week
and
a
pretty
impressive
one
for
an
irish
red
ale
had
the
typical
characteristics
of
an
irish
red
ale
but
it
was
richer
hoppier
and
had
a
smooth
finish
drinkablity
was
up
there
with
the
bests
ive
had
in
the
style
given
its
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
style
if
your
looking
for
a
great
red
this
might
be
your
beer
the
flavor
is
great
very
elegant
with
a
creamy
yet
bubbly
mouthfeel
the
malt
profile
is
clean
and
has
a
delightful
finish
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
twix
bar
with
a
crisply
bitter
and
hoppy
finish
a
solid
beer
all
around
as
are
most
of
the
mutiny
fleet
offerings
great
balance
smooth
malt
and
crisp
hoppy
finish
d
this
was
an
average
strong
red
ale
that
was
fairly
tasty
but
not
that
clean
body
was
only
ok
but
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
at
least
it
was
really
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
impressive
either

support
local
business
these
mutiny
fleet
beers
are
often
hit
or
miss
with
me
but
i
ended
up
really
enjoying
this
one
the
key
was
keeping
that
abv
on
the
lower
side
of
the
imperial
style
as
7
seemed
about
perfect
for
the
fullness
of
the
flavors
and
body
here
while
still
keeping
this
very
approachable
and
drinkable
this
one
could
have
easily
been
a
mess
but
kudos
to
clipper
city
for
showing
some
restraint
this
was
well
done
not
a
huge
red
fan
but
this
one
was
pretty
tasty
o
not
much
good
to
say
here
there
is
no
way
to
know
how
long
ago
this
beer
was
made
but
its
certainly
not
good
in
its
current
state
o
i
have
not
tried
many
beers
from
this
brewery
but
so
far
nothing
has
impressed
me
this
ale
unfortunately
is
no
exception
it
is
not
bad
by
any
means
but
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
of
many
of
the
better
amber
and
red
ales
out
there
i
would
not
turn
it
down
however
and
could
see
it
being
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
simple
meal
of
grilled
meats
and
vegetables
i
think
it
could
also
be
a
good
gateway
brew
for
those
just
getting
into
american
craft
ales
cherokee
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
wide
range
of
events
foods
or
attitudes
where
it
wont
blow
you
away
with
its
strength
complexity
or
uniqueness
it
satisfies
the
palate
on
all
fronts
and
with
ease
medium
amber
with
hints
of
red
in
appearance
smell
is
mild
with
very
slight
hints
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
full
and
is
very
noticable
on
the
side
of
the
tongue
taste
this
is
a
very
inviting
flavor
there
is
a
sweet
flavor
with
a
little
hint
of
beech
wood
we
think
nice
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
brew
one
that
will
go
well
with
a
good
burger
appearance
in
the
growler
was
redish
brown
color
with
an
almost
orange
hue
to
it
when
poured
the
head
was
almost
nonexistent
the
smell
was
fruity
like
rotten
bananas
which
isnt
necessarily
bad
had
an
unforgivingly
sharp
after
taste
did
not
go
away
without
a
fight
mouthfeel
ugh
was
like
drinking
a
flat
soda
syrupy
feel
i
would
say
how
the
last
gulp
was
but
i
didnt
get
that
far
overall
i
was
thoroughly
disappointed
considering
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
this
particular
brew
all
week
d
meh
might
be
better
on
tap
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
bottled
offering
drinks
ok
here
the
bitter
flavor
may
hang
some
up
a
bit
slight
aftertaste
with
hops
and
some
malt
medium
body
and
effervescence
a
decent
brew
but
a
little
too
hoppy
for
the
style
additionally
the
balance
is
off
draught
in
one
of
their
calhoun
locations
the
first
problem
with
this
was
the
heavily
frosted
mug
they
served
this
in
there
were
chunks
of
frost
in
with
my
beer
the
beer
itself
was
a
fairly
clear
amber
color
after
the
frost
subsided
mine
had
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
mild
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
nose
the
taste
was
decent
enough
slightly
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
pretty
east
drinking
nondescript
average
and
uninteresting
however
d
the
overall
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
about
average
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
drinkability
probably
my
favorite
of
all
the
beers
ive
tasted
at
smoky
mountain
brewery
i
would
recommend
starting
with
this
one
caramel
malty
start
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
coming
in
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
though
kinda
reminds
me
of
what
a
killians
light
would
taste
like
if
there
was
such
a
beast
hops
are
noticably
absent
and
the
finish
is
a
little
overmetallic
even
for
the
style
nice
color
but
the
head
leaves
faster
than
the
kid
who
pulled
the
fire
drill
wont
revisit
but
this
is
not
my
style
preference
either
should
have
branched
out
and
tried
the
different
varieties
but
once
again
my
fascination
with
red
ales
kept
telling
me
to
give
this
one
a
chance
more
like
6
or
7
chances
on
this
particular
evening
in
the
smokies
not
really
characteristic
of
a
pure
red
ale
but
at
the
same
time
a
very
drinkable
beer
sweet
caramel
taste
but
with
overtones
of
dull
nothingness
and
a
mouthfeel
that
really
lacks
in
overall
satifaction
the
room
was
too
dark
for
a
real
view
of
the
color
but
from
what
i
could
tell
it
looked
more
like
a
pale
ale
well
what
can
i
say
about
this
brew
this
isnt
a
great
beer
and
is
definitely
not
true
to
its
style
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
pigeon
forge
this
was
very
pale
for
a
red
ale
more
of
an
amber
color
than
red
a
very
thin
head
with
minimal
lacing
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
strong
caramel
taste
i
think
this
is
close
to
a
pale
ale
in
flavor
but
not
quite
a
red
ale
somewhere
in
between
this
is
a
crisp
and
refreshing
ale
that
is
smooth
to
drink
and
i
enjoyed
it
although
someone
expecting
a
full
bodied
red
ale
might
be
dissapointed
ive
sampled
every
beer
this
brewery
makes
over
the
past
few
years
and
it
had
been
a
while
since
id
tried
their
red
ale
the
girl
refilling
my
growler
request
botched
my
order
and
gave
the
red
ale
instead
of
the
harvestfest
marzen
it
pales
in
comparison
to
what
it
did
in
the
mid
to
late
90s
when
the
brewery
first
opened
a
very
light
amber
too
light
to
be
considered
a
red
ale
s
low
key
malts
with
slight
hints
of
sweet
grain
t
very
mild
with
less
malt
than
needed
for
the
style
m
thin
and
watery
d
not
great
as
this
is
not
a
beer
im
happy
about
getting
in
lieu
of
the
tasty
marzen
this
beer
is
shadow
of
its
former
self
as
the
original
cherokee
ale
had
much
more
character
body
and
taste
the
noble
tribe
wouldnt
be
thrilled
about
its
namesake
considering
how
light
in
the
ass
this
ale
has
become
this
beer
looks
like
a
pale
ale
there
is
little
head
the
smell
is
really
hard
to
detect
maybe
just
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
like
a
cross
of
a
pale
ale
and
red
ale
only
this
is
not
all
that
great
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
but
there
is
a
small
bit

harshness
in
the
finish
not
a
good
representation
of

style
i
could
drink
again
but
probably
wont
pours
an
amber
color
with
an
audible
fizzy
head
that
is
gone
in
seconds
smell
is
dominated
by
caramel
with
a
hint
of
wheat
and
bannana
flavor
again
is
caramel
dominated
very
malty
and
hops
are
not
noticable
thin
in
the
mouth
overall
a
very
average
beverage
mouthfeel
is
thin
bitey
but
it
goes
down
not
exactly
a
pleasantry
this
could
be
a
much
better
brew
if
the
flavour
was
kicked
up
a
notch
and
the
freshness
issue
in
the
smell
was
remedied
its
probably
my
least
favourite
of
their
brews
that
i
tried
drinkability
great
session
pale
and
a
fine
start
to
the
sampler
set
drinkability
is
not
very
good
would
not
recommend
unless
your
desperate
as
i
was
according
to
the
brewery
blurb
this
beer
was
inspired
by
the
famous
red
ales
of
ireland
must
not
have
been
too
inspirational
overall
flavor
profile
was
flat
with
none
of
the
robustness
that
characterizes
a
good
red
ale
needed
something
more
hops
more
malt
something
to
punch
things
up
okay
but
boring
cherokee
red
ale
is
a
strange
brew
that
just
might
have
defined
a
new
style
red
porter
it
isnt
bad
beer
really
its
just
forgettable
this
beer
is
proof
that
just
because
a
beer
is
a
micro
very
tasty
rich
red
lager
with
a
slightly
hoppy
taste
probably
one
of
the
best
and
most
interesting
red
beers
available
this
was
a
decent
brew
not
one
that
i
would
have
regularly
or
probably
buy
again
but
i
have
two
more
of
these
left
got
3
as
part
of
the
shorts
autumn
variety
pack
i
definitely
wont
mind
drinking
them
very
thin
and
very
sweet
one
dimensional
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
red
ale
would
definetly
drink

o

that
would

underrated
beer
overall
in
my
opinion
this
beer
really
does
nothing
for
me
except
encourage
me
to
dump
it
out
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
it
washes
down
rather
quickly
it
leaves
a
faint
coat
near
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
finishes
slightly
dry
overall
this
is
a
decent
one
not
overwhelmed
by
it
i
think
it
would
improve
with
out
the
chocolate
taste
at
the
end
o
a
good
easy
drinking
brew
id
have
more
if
i
had
the
chance
overall
im
shocked
at
the
77100
rating
thats
a
decent
score
but
i
actually
thoroughly
enjoy
this
one
and
its
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
shorts
that
sour
smell
tart
flavor
malty
finish
all
of
it
comes
together
well
may
i
have
another
i
hate
when
you
try
beers
when
youre
well
tipsy
and
then
make
an
effort
to
try
them
sober
and
things
seem
totally
different
i
remember
this
being
such
a
nice
harmony
of
styles
with
such
interesting
character
this
version
seems
soso
kind
of
a
mildly
sour
dish
of
amber
tones
and
i
cant
quite
say
what
else
i
really
wish
i
had
taken
notes
when
i
tried
this
first
wherever
it
was
but
alas
more
sober
ponderings
are
probably
more
accurate
ones
o
a
strange
brew
not
to
sure
what
to
make
of
this
one
kind
of
one
alot
different
then
any
other
brew
i
have
had
latley
deffinatly
not
bad
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
aftertaste
though
o
this
was
a
drain
pour
for
me
there
was
nothing
about
this
from
the
floral
hop
profile
to
the
overly
sweet
malt
bill
that
was
inviting
to
me
o
good
much
better
in
this
style
the
great
lakes
version
reminded
me
of
cooked
cabbage
overall
a
nice
complex
well
balanced
beer
not
overly
sweet
at
all
and
very
easy
to
drink
enough
hops
to
hide
any
alcohol
whatsoever
this
would
make
avery
good
interesting
and
refreshing
sesssion
beer
overall
quite
a
solid
brew
with
good
malt
complexity
o
a
cool
brew
from
shorts
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
fusionstyle
brew
but
this
seemed
to
be
more
of
a
traditional
style
solid
drinkability
its
too
bad
i
only
had
one
bottle
im
very
impressed
i
dont
often
buy
malt
driven
beers
that
arent
either
a
stout
or
a
porter
by
far
the
best
irish
red
ive
had
o
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
this
is
pretty
good
very
maltheavy
almost
no
noticeable
hops
but
at
the
same
time
its
quite
light
and
thin
o
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
shorts
but
its
not
too
bad
none
of
the
flavors
are
really
overstated
which
is
a
very
good
thing
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
smooth
and
i
could
easily
have
a
few
glasses
of
this
throughout
the
evening
overall
i
think
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
irish
red
ales
that
i
have
had
so
far
i
recommend
trying
it
out
if
you
come
across
it
i
would
buy
it
agian
o
overall
i
like
it
and
would
drink
it
again
and
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
somewhere
many
thanks
to
kzoobrew
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
beer
so
far
pretty
impressed
with
shorts
this
is
another
offering
i
have
never
had
before
poured
from
bottle
into
brooklyn
tulip
this
is
an
ugly
looking
beer
looks
like
storm
drain
watersomething
i
would
find
in
a
rest
stop
toilet
little
to
no
head
visible
small
bubbles
streaming
from
the
bottle
of
the
glass
i
assume
this
is
going
to
be
pretty
carbonated
smell
strawberries
a
hint
of
plastic
some
offflavors
here
on
the
nose
taste
watered
down
plastic
mixed
with
strawberries
something
is
wrong
here
im
not
sure
i
would
call
this
a
drain
pour
because
other
than
the
plastic
flavors
its
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
there
just
arent
many
redeemable
qualities
to
this
one
overall
not
a
fan
other
offerings
from
shorts
have
been
very
strong
this
is
an
exception
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
deep
amber
color
with
an
almost
nonexistant
head
the
nose
is
malt
forward
with
a
mixture
of
dark
fruits
caramel
biscuit
and
nut
flavor
is
all
malt
too
with
the
caramel
and
fruity
notes
coming
to
the
forefront
mouthfeel
is
quite
viscous
with
a
very
thin
carbonation
and
slightly
drying
finish
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
would
be
easy
to
tip
back
a
few
of
these
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
needs
better
balance
with
hops
and
less
raisins
the
tangy
aftertaste
kind
of
ruins
this
for
me
not
bad
before
then
but
nothing
good
going
on
either
o
its
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
the
mouth
feel
is
the
biggest
turnoff
for
me
o
i
didnt
pick
hardly
any
of
the
infection
in
the
nose
but
its
definitely
there
in
the
taste
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
infection
o
not
a
very
good
red
ale
the
strange
fruitiness
and
metal
note
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
dont
like
red
ales
and
this
confirms
it
further
o
probably
one
of
shorts
less
impressive
offerings
im
glad
i
opted
for
the
single
as
this
just
tasted
a
little
weird
to
me
i
just
found
it
a
little
too
much
to
have
the
fruitiness
without
much
else
a
good
strong
ale
the
heat
hidden
well
enough
and
with
a
healthy
balance
of
sturdy
malt
and
peppy
yet
restrained
hops
o
lackluster
not
horrible
but
not
appetizing
wont
seek
out
again
forgettable
and
mediocre
a
very
solid
beer
but
quite
one
dimensional
overall
i
was
not
expecting
so
much
sour
at
first
i
thought
the
beer
was
bad
besides
that
this
brew
is
just
an
irish
red
with
a
sour
peppery
zing
to
it
nothing
special
o
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
a
light
borderline
session
ale
flavors
are
not
palate
shocking
and
more
is
better
in
this
case
i
found
a
far
cry
of
a
qisper
of
a
sour
note
on
the
finish
as
the
glass
warmed
as
a
wild
ale
this
would
not
only
be
a
good
base
but
an
interesting
combination
appearance
is
redbrown
with
about
one
finger
of
head
its
smell
has
cherries
toffee
and
bread
tart
upon
sipping
i
think
that
this
is
different
than
other
irish
reds
that
i
have
consumed
in
the
past
the
malts
are
there
that
i
would
expect
but
spices
such
as
pepper
are
more
pronounced
and
also
a
sour
aspect
that
really
sets
it
apart
i
was
not
expecting
that
in
this
style
mf
is
lightmed
good
carbonation
for
me
this
was
pretty
good
partly
because
it
is
so
different
from
most
other
irish
reds
o
well
i
can
say
ive
had
it
tried
to
be
objective
but
have
a
hard
time
finding
any
redeeming
quality
of
this
one
overall
an
interesting
beer
with
a
few
strange
flavors
pitting
against
each
other
and
a
deliciously
simple
malt
backbone
in
the
distance
unique
albiet
confused
overall
im
starting
to
find
that
a
lot
of
shorts
beers
are
very
hit
or
miss
some
of
them
are
absolutely
amazing
and
on
the
other
hand
some
of
them
are
absolute
avoids
and
this
is
of
the
latter
there
is
nothing
going
on
here
really
weird
flavours
and
only
bready
malt
and
very
slight
earthy
hops
come
through
at
all
personally
i
am
not
a
fan
and
as
far
as
the
reviews
go
it
seems
like
everyone
is
pretty
much
on
the
same
boat
avoid
this
one
as
there
are
so
many
more
better
shorts
offerings
out
there
for
you
to
discover
o
both
of
the
irish
reds
ive
rated
ive
enjoyed
more
especially
the
glbc
conways
irish
ale
i
was
a
little
disappointed
by
this
beer
but
it
was
horrible
but
if
youre
a
huge
irish
red
fan
go
for
it
if
no
there
are
better
alternatives
available
for
this
style
disappointing
shorts
brews
often
contain
flashes
of
incoherent
brilliance
that
leaves
one
reeling
but
this
is
another
effort
marred
by
something
faint
sour
notes
really
bring
this
one
down
coulda
been
a
contender
notes
this
one
is
a
very
unique
irish
red
ale
which
is
a
good
thing
the
sour
notes
set
it
apart
from
other
irish
red
ales
cheers
edit
on
drinking
another
bottle
a
month
later
i
noticed
a
little
bit
of
a
sour
taste
i
think
they
may
have
some
sloppy
sanitation
procedures
because
previous
bottles
didnt
taste
like
this
and
this
style
shouldnt
the
beer
appears
amber
in
color
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
brings
malt
slight
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
caramels
the
flavor
is
pretty
simple
malt
with
a
bit
of
caramel
its
decent
enough
but
rather
bland
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
an
ok
beer
albeit
unexciting
pours
a
murky
dark
red
color
with
small
white
head
scent
is
malty
and
grainy
with
a
hint
of
caramel
taste
is
initially
toffee
and
caramel
but
immediately
followed
by
a
skunkytart
offflavor
the
maltiness
is
put
off
by
this
now
i
love
me
some
tartsour
beers
but
this
one
is
just
not
that
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
a
little
light
drinkability
is
fair
overall
this
is
not
a
good
beer
at
all
would
not
seek
this
out
again
o
its
a
little
drytart
for
my
personal
preferences
but
its
still
a
decent
red
ale
i
probably
wont
go
out
searching
for
this
beer
but
if
im
at
a
store
with
a
limited
variety
or
at
a
friends
place
i
wouldnt
mind
picking
it
up
again
slightly
sour
note
picked
up
cherries
raisins
woody
interesting
brew
moderate
complexity
toffee
malts
come
through
loud
and
clear
moderate
drying
hop
bite
late
not
bad
but
unlikely
id
go
for
this
one
too
often
taste
begins
sweet
sour
cherries
in
the
middle
with
a
lightly
chalky
close
more
sour
than
would
hopeexpect
mouthfeel
is
average
and
drinkability
is
okay
not
sure
what
is
up
with
the
sour
but
since
it
was
only
instate
for
a
limited
amount
of
time
i
have
to
assume
that
this
is
what
it
should
be
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
drinkable
and
interesting
but
not
my
favorite
from
shorts
by
a
longshot
drinkability
its
quite
good
while
i
prefer
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
this
is
very
smooth
and
thirst
quenching
perfect
for
a
hot
day
or
anytime
really
the
beer
is
sweet
and
not
much
else
i
guess
it
doesnt
taste
bad
it
is
just
a
bland
plain
irish
red
ale
nothing
to
see

this
beer
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
noticed
that
people
have
been
giving
it
average
scores
but
this
is
more
than
a
average
irish
red
shorts
is
known
for
all
their
crazy
beers
but
this
one
shouldnt
slip
by
i
personally
could
drink
a
sixer
of
this
and
am
glad
i
live
only
5
miles
or
so

overall
i
just
dont
have
a
lot
to
say
overall
a
good
amber
ale
but
not
great
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wont
go
back
for
more
my
first
soso
brew
from
shorts
d
really
dissapointed
with
this
i
love
shorts
beers
overall
but
this
is
by
far
my
least
favorite
i
am
bummed
i
have
4
more
bottles
of
it
oh
well
d
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
good
i
could
sit
down
and
drink
these
all
night
d
a
sweet
buttery
beer
not
really
a
stand
out
but
it
wasnt
bad
ive
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
shorts
and
this
definitely
keeps
with
the
trend
pick
one
up
sometime
like
most
shorts
brews
the
mouthfeel
was
spoton
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
strive
to
recreate
in
my
homebrewing
efforts
gold
standard
for
malt
heavy
ales
and
lives
up
to
its
name
as
well
truly
magical
i
cant
wait
to
see
this
on
tap
at
my
local
bellaire
is
a
bit
of
a
drive
from
down
here
i
imagine
that
tasting
it
at
the
source
can
not
be
beat
though
the
current
version
of
the
magician
has
an
abv
of
about
5
its
a
sessionable
amber
ale
remember
hops
are
wonderful
but
sometimes
a
good
malty
ale
is
just
as
great
mouthfeel
is
creamy
slightly
bitter
good
texture
and
easy
to
drink
for
an
amber
i
would
rate
magician
a
decent
pick
i
like
oktoberfest
beers
and
this
reminds
me
strongly
of
that
style
if
it
was
available
yeararound
at
a
bar
near
me
i
would
probably
drink
it
semiregularly
because
it
bridges
the
gap
between
tasty
and
quaffable
pretty
well
its
nothing
remarkable
but
i
like
what
it
has
to
offer
not
bad
at
all
had
the
chance
to
try
it
n
would
drink
another
o
fairly
average
but
if
you
like
malt
give
it
a
try
very
solid
red
ale
one
of
my
favorite
beers
finish
is
kind
of
dry
and
leaves
a
bit
of
a
bitter
hop
bite
on
the
finish
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
even
if
it
isnt
overly
complex
not
a
bad
beer
to
enjoy
a
few
of
and
not
have
to
think
too
deeply
about
while
you
enjoy
them
clear
deep
reddish
brown

bubbled

dissipates

heavy

and

obviously

medium

moderate

middle
of
the
road
irish
ale
with
a
bit
of
an
oxygen
problem
got
this
as
part
of
a
botm
club
shipment
wanted
to
like
it
but
i
got
a
very
overpowering
metallic
taste
that
just
ruined
it
for
me
too
bad
it
had
really
nice
color
and
decent
aroma
maybe
i
got
a
bad
or
old
can
31214
maybe
it
was
just
me
either
way
this
one
cleaned
the
kitchen
sink
drain
overall
a
very
enjoyable
red
with
lots
of
flavor
and
a
nice
sweet
but
not
cloying
taste
as
it
is
nicely
balanced
by
some
good
roasted
malt
and
very
light
grainy
and
hop
flavors
overall
impression
an
easy
drinking
balanced
irish
red
not
sure
why
this
hasnt
gotten
more
love
well
crafted
approachable
and
tasty
glad
i
tried
it
just
hearing
a
crack
was
enough
to
give
me
a
chubby
i
began
the
inverted
glug
and
sat
back
as
the
pseudocascade
began
it
settled
into
twoplus
fingers
of
fizzy
tawny
head
that
immediately
began
to
fizzle
and
pop
its
way
out
of
existence
color
was
a
copperybrown
srm
17
o
probably
not
the
best
summer
beer
its
ninety
plus
degrees
as
i
drink
it
but
a
very
tasty
drinkable
irish
red
ale
overall
this
is
a
solid
flagship
beer
for
north
country
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
as
it
is
not
overlycomplex
in
flavor
or
aromas
but
this
is
a
sturdy
version
of
the
irish
red
ale
id
prefer
this
over
the
commercially
available
imports
ie
murphys
smithwicks
any
day
the
dry
finish
is
a
desirable
effect
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
the
taste
left
alot
to
be
desired
appearance
was
good
and
even
the
smell
was
okay
but
something
with
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
screamed
cheap
beer
hope
you
guys
get
it
right
im
local
to
the
brewery
and
would
love
to
see
you
guys
take
off
try
to
improve
this
style
please
a
big
thanks
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
pretty
amber
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
light
a
bit
of
malts
taste
is
malts
some
caramel
a
bit
of
sweetness
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
nice
looking
beer
which
ive
also
had
on
tap
not
much
flavor
so
probably
a
good
beer
for
nonbeer
drinkers
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
go
to
the
local
fire
department
so
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
occasionally
eh
this
beer
is
merely
okay
at
best
its
well
too
malty
and
sweet
from
it
for
my
liking
theres
too
much
good
beer
out
there
to
be
spending
time
on
bland
stuff
like
this
better
beer
out
there
and
better
beer
from
north
country
to
be
trying
just
okay
thats
how
id
write
it
in
my
book
o
when
people
visit
the
brewery
this
the
most
liked
beer
but
for
what
reason
theres
so
much
malt
going
on
here
its
not
a
clean
and
light
feeling
beer
too
warm
too
flat
fairly
enjoyable
this
one
is
better
ontap
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
caramel
subtlety
good
brew
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
amber
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
roast
and
a
sugar
cookie
batter
like
smell
in
the
taste
sweet
malts
a
dry
sugar
cookie
and
a
small
hop
in
the
end
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
pine
hop
in
the
aftertaste
nice
red
sweet
cookie
like
but
balanced
has
a
bit
of
a
minerally
taste
to
it
also
was
a
bit
hazy
for
the
style
probably
not
filtered
which
is
odd
cause
it
doesnt
have
much
taste
for
an
unfiltered
beer
i
do
like
the
idea
of
helping
the
fire
department
but
i
wish
the
beer
tasted
bettter
it
was
way
too
mild
for
me
pretty
refreshing
nothing
special
but
an
easy
to
like
session
beer
hurt
by
a
lack
of
a
noticeable
scent
though
had
the
cask
version
of
this
beer
at
pipers
pub
in
pittsburgh
im
used
to
having
a
nice
creamy
head
from
a
beer
drawn
from
a
hand
pump
but
this
one
had
none
at
all
very
low
carbonation
the
nose
was
literally
nonexistant
similar
to
smelling
a
glass
of
water
very
strange
the
flavor
followed
suit
with
not
much
of
anything
going
on
very
thin
in
body
not
much
in
the
way
of
a
discernable
malt
pallete
and
only
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
tail
end
of
the
finish
to
sum
this
beer
up
in
one
word
bland
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
being
that
it
is
local
but
ended
up
completely
dissapointed
and
5
poorer
not
a
great
introduction
to
north
country
brewing
came
to
the
table
a
wonderful
deep
bloodruby
red
with
a
nice
bit
of
thick
foam
and
had
very
nice
lacing
throughout
very
nice
thick
malty
scent
deep
and
slightly
woodsy
excellent
taste
a
very
nice
maltiness
just
south
of
a
brown
ale
with
a
touch
of
tartness
to
it
and
a
nice
light
hoppy
finish
unlike
a
lot
of
red
ales
they
did
not
overhop
this
one
it
was
just
about
perfect
went
down
wonderfully
smooth
although
i
know
part
of
that
is
because
it
was
through
a
cask
ale
system
id
like
to
compare
to
a
noncask
version
but
definitely
recommend
it
on
cask
pours
a
dark
red
to
slightly
orange
color
with
little
to
no
head
the
smell
is
of
caramel
malts
with
some
slight
smell
of
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
very
similar
it
has
a
slight
caramel
malt
taste
that
is
slightly
sweet
and
is
balanced
out
with
some
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
not
much
going
on
for
the
mouthfeel
the
drinkability
is
good
it
is
a
serviceable
beer
that
you
could
have
a
couple
of
but
not
go
all
night
d
pretty
solid
ale
another
good
one
from
north
country
notes
second
time
ive
tried
this
one
this
seems
to
be
a
local
favorite
i
tried
it
at
the
penn
brewfest
and
it
was
popular
among
my
group
back
then
very
clean
and
crisp
finish
with
moderate
carbonation
not
a
lot
of
texture
to
it
i
guess
there
was
not
much
substance
overall
a
solid
selection
but
very
mild
in
all
aspects
d
a
decent
session
beer
sweeter
than
i
prefer
but
in
accordance
with
the
style
dthis
was
delicious
and
i
could
have
drank
it
all
night
d
my
friend
loves
this
beer
im
not
too
keen
on
irish
reds
but
this
is
well
made
much
better
than
killians
imo
item
of
note
ncb
donates
a
small
percentage
of
all
sales
of
this
item
to
the
aforementioned
station
33
firehouse
in
slippery
rock
so
try
a
glass
enjoy
a
good
irish
ale
and
help
out
our
heroes
all
at
the
same
time
mild
but
refreshing
and
not
without
some
darker
earthyamber
richness
while
remaining
mostly
aethereal
and
crisp
nice
irish
red
good
color
and
smell
might
have
been
one
of
my
first
craft
beers
its
nothing
extrodinary
but
given
the
style
its
no
supposed
to
be
easy
drinking
and
simple
nutty
tea
like
maltiness
lager
like
crispness
040513
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
this
is
malt
malt
malt
not
shy
at
all
surprisingly
refreshing
for
something
so
assertive
nice
body
not
sweet
noticeable
but
not
in
an
in
your
face
kind
of
way
overall
an
okay
beer
but
not
my
favorite
tastes
similar
to
a
doppelbock
in
terms
of
overall
malt
profile
maltier
than
an
oktoberfest
but
sweeter
than
a
doppelbock
its
ok
but
not
spectacular
their
website
lists
it
as
a
good
session
beer
and
it
should
be
with
a
5
4
alcohol
content
but
i
couldnt
down
many
of
these
due
to
the
noticeable
alcoholic
flavor
o
very
nice
red
ale
ive
been
a
fan
of
others
of
this
style
ive
tried
and
this
is
no
exception
like
the
maltybreadybiscuity
taste
id
give
this
another
go
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
3
55
o
definitely
on
the
lower
end
of
the
craft
beer
spectrum
imo
you
could
do
worse
however
rjt
it
is
very
sessionable
and
easy
to
pair
with
food
harpoon
has
nailed
the
style
onot
a
bad
beer
at
all
an
above
average
irishstyle
red
ale
in
my
opinion
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
a
little
better
than
other
offerings
in
the
irish
red
style
not
a
favorite
for
me
but
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
of
these
in
a
single
session
pours
a
medium
amber
color
full
fluffy
white
head
moderate
retention
scent
is
pale
and
mild
with
notes
of
caramel
malts
and
stale
grassy
hops
taste
brings
a
bit
more
to
the
table
caramel
malts
still
dominate
with
only
a
light
touch
of
hoppyness
quite
grassy
earthy
lighter
bodied
and
heavily
bubbly
really
felt
like
i
had
a
vienna
lager
as
opposed
to
an
irish
red
just
too
light
and
fizzy
for
me
the
verdict
not
bad
an
above
average
irish
red
its
a
good
solid
choice
for
a
night
of
dancing
and
debauchery
or
a
day
of
celebrating
the
arrival
of
spring
maybe
not
a
brew
ill
look
forward
to
with
anticipation
each
year
but
not
one
id
turn
down
either
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
reds
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
thus
far
the
taste
seems
to
be
a
combination
of
alcohol
which
is
odd
considering
the
abv
and
malt
its
quite
enjoyable
as
a
yearly
st
pats
drink
overall
pretty
nice
i
would
love
to
try
a
different
celtic
red
style
to
compare
o
i
believe
this
to
be
a
high
quality
example
of
the
style
it
is
at
least
to
my
liking
although
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
irish
red
ales
or
red
ales
in
general
this
brew
has
a
solid
malt
backbone
that
carries
it
through
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
this
up
the
next
time
i
get
a
rare
hankering
for
an
irish
red
o
lets
face
it
this
isnt
the
greatest
or
most
appreciated
style
of
beer
and
while
its
one
i
used
to
appreciate
ive
grown
away
from
it
nevertheless
this
beer
is
just
about
spoton
for
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
notes
the
taste
cannot
live
up
to
the
amazing
nose
but
it
is
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
and
easily
the
best
irish
red
ive
had
actually
it
reminds
me
of
bass
ale
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
but
this
being
st
patricks
day
i
will
go
forth
and
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
o
decent
beer
but
not
that
interesting
overall
malt
profile
could
use
a
bit
more
depth
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
though
overall
a
decent
red
ale
it
has
an
easy
drinking
and
noncomplex
flavor
profile
that
has
nice
smoother
flavors
which
makes
a
good
beer
to
have
while
enjoying
the
company
of
other
pours
a
dark
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
caramel
slight
hops
and
some
nutty
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malty
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
low
c
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
trader
joes
in
san
diego
o
a
good
effort
not
anything
to
make
you
go
wow
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
the
24
oz
i
dont
know
if
this
is
some
kind
an
anomaly
or
if
harpoon
is
actually
coming
to
ca
but
id
like
to
see
more
from
them
in
the
future
t
seems
like
its
going
to
hit
upfront
with
a
citrus
hop
bite
but
that
fades
quickly
into
a
lot
of
sweet
bready
malt
some
caramel
malt
syrup
and
some
grain
mouthfeel
is
pretty
watery
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
easy
going
light
alcohol
fun
but
sweet
irish
red
o
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
one
that
could
easily
be
drank
in
either
the
winter
or
spring
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
good
worth
a
shot
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
aroma
and
the
rich
color
we
were
surprised
to
find
some
estery
sweetness
as
well
as
fruit
and
bitterness
among
the
rich
malty
background
the
flavoring
however
was
a
bit
basic
and
skirted
on
the
adjuncty
side
making
this
guy
less
than
perfect
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
red
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
sweet
malt
with
some
dark
fruit
thrown
in
i
get
a
ton
of
raisins
and
cherries
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
a
lot
of
sweet
toffee
and
some
light
dark
fruit
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
this
one
was
better
than
most
i
have
tried
o
decent
beer
but
nothing
great
overall
very
malty
so
much
that
the
beer
texture
is
affected
a
lovely
clear
red
amber
ale
wit
a
good
head
and
nice
lacing
nose
carries
aromas
of
caramel
malt
light
sweetness
and
some
toasted
whole
grain
bread
a
light
fruitiness
blooms
as
it
warms
up
and
indeed
this
is
a
beer
best
served
at
cool
rather
than
cold
temperatures
to
allow
the
flavors
to
develop
speaking
of
flavors
the
taste
is
nicely
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
malt
and
chewy
breadiness
there
is
a
mild
sweetness
and
firm
yeasty
fruitiness
that
is
a
hallmark
of
good
uk
style
brewing
this
one
gets
better
as
it
warms
finish
is
clean
with
a
touch
of
metal
and
lingering
toast
and
grains
feel
is
medium
light
with
a
smooth
and
lightly
effervescent
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
that
touts
itself
for
st
pattys
day
and
it
is
more
that
up
to
the
task

this
is
a

very

for
being
almost
a

beer
i
would
have
this
again
poured
from
a

into
a
tumbler

the
beer
is
a
vibrant
dark

quickly
settles
into

there
is
a
slight

bitterness
that
cleans
up
the
tail
end
of
the
flavor
profile
leading
into
a
light
richly
sweet
aftertaste
the
body
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
sharpness
for
the
finish
slightly
cloying
leaving
a
slight
linger
behind
easy
to
drink
and
some
interesting
and
light
flavors
o
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
a
decent
irish
red
and
this
certainly
hit
the
spot
nothing
to
really
get
excited
over
somewhat
of
a
bland
style
i
could
see
this
appealing
to
macro
drinkers
trying
to
convert
exspecially
those
who
enjoy
yuengling
lager
almost
the
same
beer
with
an
ale
yeast
and
maybe
the
slightest
bit
more
body
but
tis
the
season
the
flavor
has
some
good
toasted

with
earthy

a

this
brew
is
making
me
want
to
look
into
this
style
again
a
great
treat
here
tasty
full
bodied
looks
great
and
is
very
drinkable
great
stuff
here
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
would
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
with
my
st
pattys
celebration
overall
this
beer
is
ok
but
it
seems
like
there
is
a
little
too
much
going
on
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wouldnt
go
back
and
have
it
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
chilled

foamy
head
about
a
quarter
inch
dissipated
to
some
lingering

hint
of

color
is
golden

nice
ruddy
appearance
for
an
irish

feel
in
the
mouth
with
just
a
bit
of
extra
carbonation
floral
hop
taste
with
a
hint
of
caramel
finishes
bitter
and
dry
overall
very
nice
solid
red
ale
o
not
one
of
my
favorites
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
scream
about
might
have
again
o
an
interesting
take
on
an
irish
red
fruity
and
refreshing
yet
nicely
balanced
by
the
sweet
malt
better
than
i
was
expecting
poured
a
pretty
2
bright
beige
head
of
average
lifespan
the
body
is
a
nice
clear
amber
but
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
red
ale
it
smells
of
toasted
malt
and
a
little
hops
the
taste
is
kind
of
a
weak
version
of
a
scotch
ale
this
beer
is
ok
i
could
drink
it
regularly
but
its
not
really
a
standout
oanother
irish
red
ale
that
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
mesh
of
flavors
isnt
there
overall
this
is
a
solid
irish
red
obviously
made
with
care
and
good
quality
ingredients
it
doesnt
necessarily
bring
anything
new
to
the
style
but
it
is
wellcrafted
and
nicely
balanced
i
personally
thought
this
was
a
very
good
irish
red
very
smooth
and
tasty
i
hope
it
is
released
again
next
year
very
drinkable
a
good
allaround
irish
red
pretty
close
to
the
style
from
my
experience
i
could
have
used
some
more
hops
though
not
bright
ones
this
really
isnt
a
bad
little
red
overall
this
is
nice
beer
nothing
to
complain
about
yes
i
would
drink
it
again
and
i
enjoyed
it
as
a
decent
irish
red
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
and
might
buy
more
in
the
future
next
time
theyre
available
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
could
have
used
a
touch
more
of
a
hit
though
the
spices
were
a
nice
addition
they
werent
quite
perfect
and
enough
on
their
own
a
rough
beer
tod
rink
odd
malty
aromas
light
orange
coloured
body
i
did
not
like
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
still
a
little
drinkability
i
have
had
better
in
the
style
not
the
worst
harpoon
ending
with
something
more
flavourful
from
the
brewery
thanks
radek
d
doesnt
feel
well
put
together
in
some
ways
it
seems
more
like
a
lager
version
despite
the
ale
in
the
name
clean
light
sulfur
rather
edgey
and
angular
doesnt
seem
rounded
at
all
minimal
caramel
and
sweetness
otherwise
in
style
but
pushes
the
margins
just
barely
underaverage
drinking
overall
highly
drinkable
however
a
bit
less
malt
than
id
like
for
an
irish
red
to
have
the
beer
lacks
the
unmistakable
slightly
pungent
malt
profile
one
would
expect
from
an
irish
red
i
cant
help
but
wonder
whether
harpoon
dialed
this
one
back
a
bit
to
shoot
for
more
of
a
gatewaytype
beer
not
bad
but
could
have
been
better
imo
i
did
not
review
it
but
remember
enjoying
the
hibernian
ale
more
a
few
years
back
crisp
and
light
on
the
palate
dry
refreshing
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
flavor
that
recalls
an
alt
i
really
like
this
brew
i
find
it
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
more
flavor
than
your
standard
lager
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
in
hot
weather
as
i
think
the
light
dry
body
will
go
well
with
hot
humid
days
while
providing
a
good
amount
of
toasty
flavor
food
pairing
this
brew
screams
lamb
potatoes
root
vegetables
hearty
stews
braised
beef
oddly
german
fare
would
go
well
jager
schnitzel
spatz
red
cabbage
and
this
brew
tuck
me
in
and
kiss
me
goodnight
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
good
flavor
and
well
made
like
most
harpoon
beers
more
notes
the
woody
tastes
seem
even
more
apparent
when
this
beer
is
served
on
tap
i
think
it
throws
the
balance
of
flavors
off
a
little
bit
one
of
the
few
beers
i
enjoyed
better
out
of
the
bottle
d
in
my
opinion
just
an
average
irish
red
a
good
one
when
the
time
is
right
but
otherwise
keep
it
moving
overall
i
liked
it
this
maybe
the
first
harpoon
beer
i
did
enjoy
kind
of
aggressive
grain
profile
but
still
very
good
would
consider
buying
a
sixer
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
this
in
a
sitting
and
even
easier
to
come
back
to
overall
its
an
average
beer
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
again
but
if
i
felt
festive
and
saw
it
on
draft
i
would
get
it
again
mo
the
initial
mouthfeel
is
fine
smooth
slightly
creamy
but
about
10
seconds
after
swallowing
there
is
such
a
dryness
in
my
throat
that
just
ruins
the
experience
i
suppose
i
could
just
keep
pounding
these
down
and
somewhat
enjoy
them
but
ill
inevitably
have
to
leave
this
beer
being
annoyed
and
disappointed
because
it
finishes
so
poorly
well
made
but
not
overly
memorable
beer
we
enjoyed
on
st
patricks
day
the
color
is
closer
to
red
than
amber
and
the
head
was
average
not
a
lot
of
aroma
which
was
disappointing
it
is
slightly
hoppy
with
a
prominent
taste
of
banana
both
on
the
tongue
and
the
finish
for
st
patricks
day
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
beer
the
color
did
have
a
slight
amber
but
it
seemed
a
bit
too
watery
just
from
looking
at
it
patchy
lacing
also
aromas
had
an
unique
hints
of
juices
such
as
apples
and
even
oranges
within
a
burnt
context
taste
had
a
bittersour
flavor
but
it
washed
down
with
a
decent
spice
to
it
i
liked
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
nice
carbonation
and
pretty
drinkable
overall
not
too
bad
pours
an
reddish
brown
color
with
average
carbonation
the
head
is
a
long
lasting
one
around
a
fingers
worth
has
a
mild
hoppy
taste
and
aroma
with
a
bitter
but
dry
finish
a
worthy
representative
of
this
class
id
certainly
would
sample
this
one
again
i
am
usually
a
rather
jovial
fan
of
any
beer
that
comes
out
of
boston
however
this
one
deserved
to
be
bent
over
my
knee
and
spanked
after
first
pour
into
a
clean
and
crisp
pilsner
glass
my
initial
thoughts
on
its
appearance
nearly
convinced
me
that
i
was
going
to
enjoy
this
beer
it
has
an
attractive
reddishamber
hue
and
a
good
inch
thick
head
on
it
after
it
settled
christ
almighty
was
i
fooled
as
i
poured
this
facade
of
a
brew
into
my
eager
mouth
i
was
immediately
struck
with
an
incredible
shock
to
my
taste
buds
like
a
spear
to
my
gut
this
beer
had
rudely
interrupted
what
i
thought
was
going
to
be
a
celestial
experience
the
taste
was
almost
nonexistant
bland
would
be
an
understatement
i
sensed
a
cripsness
to
it
that
could
have
been
better
exploited
had
the
beer
had
better
componets
to
it
the
finish
was
bitter
but
i
will
admit
that
the
aftertaste
did
not
linger
as
long
as
i
thought
it
would
i
truly
missed
the
presence
and
aroma
of
the
ingrediants
of
this
brew
as
i
have
grown
accustomed
to
smell
in
other
reds
that
i
have
tried
sorry
harpoon
your
other
brews
are
great
but
other
than
the
pleasant
appearance
this
one
was
a
crushing
failure
d
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
maybe
hoping
for
a
stronger
allaround
flavor
but
i
would
buy
another
bottle
of
this
in
the
near
future
just
not
a
6pack
this
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
beers
ive
ever
seen
the
head
was
an
awesome
golden
reddish
cream
three
fingers
high
it
looked
like
what
i
picture
a
lothlorien
beer
would
look
like
uh
maybe
this
should
be
my
last
beer
of
the
night
well
anyway
the
smell
is
not
promising
reminds
me
of
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
tried
four
horesmens
irish
red
yeeeuckkk
luckily
the
taste
although
slightly
similar
to
that
aforementioned
travesty
of
a
beer
is
actually
really
good
although
slightly
minerally
with
a
slight
tartness
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
makes
friends
with
tongue
throat
and
stomach
easily
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
would
definitely
try
again
best
by
date
stamped
on
bottle
34
inch
white
head
clear
sparkling
dark
amber
body
with
ruby
highlights
initial
bitter
taste
with
short
finish
couldnt
really
pin
the
taste
of
this
beer
down
different
than
any
other
beer
ive
had
not
really
sure
if
i
liked
it
enough
to
have
another
one
d
different
but
better
i
dont
know
ill
have
to
try
this
beer
again
later
to
solidify
my
opinion
of
it
very
underated
irish
red
ale
pretty
burnt
orange
hue
with
a
solid
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
smell
hits
you
right
out
of
the
gate
with
some
light
fruity
scents
that
complement
barley
and
malt
aromas
taste
starts
strong
but
finishes
slightly
disappointingly
that
hints
of
some
american
adjunct
lagers
that
i
dislike
fortunately
this
taste
is
bolstered
by
some
good
hop
barley
and
slight
malt
flavors
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
it
tastes
better
than
in
the
back
on
the
finish
finish
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
mouthfeel
thats
on
the
creamier
side
drinkability
is
high
with
this
one
as
it
would
be
no
problem
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
when
theres
nothing
better
decent
beer
just
not
great
or
unique
drink
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
style
it
would
come
in
handy
with
st
patricks
day
approaching
worth
a
try
if
you
happen
to
see
it
it
is
also
very
reasonable
priced
drinkabilty
well
its
a
decent
beer
but
too
light
for
me
there
are
more
solid
irish
ales
out
there
but
that
are
more
flavor
heavy
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
so
you
could
pound
a
6pack
really
easy
good
beer
but
it
cant
touch
great
lakes
conway
imo
the
ale
pours
a
brilliant
ruby
red
with
a
nice
cream
colored
head
with
decent
retention
while
the
nose
is
bright
with
lots
of
floral
flavors
cherries
and
caramel
the
mouth
starts
malty
with
a
juicy
pink
grapfruit
note
moderate
carbonation
and
a
pleasant
balancing
hoppiness
while
the
finish
returns
to
the
more
mouthwatering
malt
notes
dm
crisp
tight
carbonation
with
a
good
balance
very
drinkable
and
not
overpowering
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
into
dimpled
mug
pours
a
reddishbrown
thin
head
with
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
caramel
sweet
toasted
malts
butter
semisweet
toasted
malts
caramel
minor
hop
taste
semidry
finish
there
is
also
somewhat
of
a
thick
syrup
taste
that
is
especially
apparent
in
the
aftertaste
this
really
hurt
the
score
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
but
feels
a
little
watery
overall
a
decent
brew
d
overall
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
not
an
every
day
sit
down
at
the
pub
beer
however
it
does
have
its
merits
for
an
occasional
change
of
pace
this
is
admittedly
an
unusual
red
ale
most
beer
drinkers
will
enjoy
this
but
only
some
will
want
to
return
those
who
dont
will
have
enjoyed
the
visit
though
d
session
worthy
but
every
time
the
bandaid
returned
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
reds
and
have
a
huge
respect
for
irish
beer
most
reds
that
i
have
tried
are
american
so
the
irish
style
reds
are
somewhat
new
to
me
this
beer
was
not
in
favor
to
my
personal
pallet
harpoon
i
will
keep
trying
to
find
the
beer
for
me
in
your
company
i
still
keep
the
faith
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
id
want
many
repeats
of
simple
and
good
one
of
the
better
harpoon
offerings
d
a
nice
find
it
would
pair
well
with
pub
food
on
st
pattys
day
not
a
standout
in
any
one
dimension
but
nonetheless
enjoyable
you
might
not
remember
this
beer
but
it
wont
make
you
want
to
forget
it
nice
drinking
beer
nice
almost
pure
red
color
with
a
halfinchtoaninch
of
offwhite
foam
that
sinks
rather
quickly
malty
nose
with
hints
of
sweet
garden
vegetables
medium
body
leaning
towards
the
light
side
carbonation
is
smooth
and
creamy
sweet
maltiness
with
caramel
taffee
and
mild
woodsiness
clean
and
smooth
without
a
lot
of
aftertaste
very
drinkable
easy
to
have
more
than
one
could
knock
these
back
for
days
pours
an
ultraclear
dark
amberorange
a
tan
head
recedes
and
patches
to
the
glass
but
a
few
slow
carb
trails
smell
is
highpitched
toasted
malts
some
fresh
greens
as
well
i
tend
to
rate
finish
with
mouthfeel
and
this
beer
has
some
of
the
best
of
both
i
like
it
when
a
beer
makes
me
forget
about
the
seperation
for
taste
a
light
buddy
hops
twists
intently
into
an
absolute
blast
of
sweet
and
almost
cocoaish
roasted
malts
then
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
feel
is
carbonated
and
mediumbodied
and
hearty
drinkability
high
im
starting
to
think
i
like
these
red
ales
reading
others
reviews
i
think
i
got
a
bad
one
that
spoiled
it
tastes
spoiled
next
time
i
get
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
ill
rereview
i
picked
a
six
pack
up
on
my
way
home
from
an
out
of
state
trip
and
was
quite
thrilled
with
what
i
bought
i
have
come
to
expect
great
beers
from
harpoon
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
one
has
very
nice
sweet
smells
that
sets
up
well
for
what
your
taste
buds
have
in
store
it
also
have
a
very
sweet
malty
flavor
with
some
caramel
hints
this
would
be
a
great
desert
beer
for
sure
a
quite
respectible
entry
in
this
style
category
maltcentric
with
some
light
fruity
notes
and
a
touch
of
woodyness
body
was
just
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
than
i
would
have
liked
but
overall
an
enjoyable
sessionable
ale
that
would
be
a
fine
accompanyment
to
a
meatandpotato
meal
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
moderate
redamber
color
offwhite
head
that
starts
out
at
a
nice
twofinger
height
and
falls
down
throughout
good
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
light
caramel
and
toffee
notes
plus
a
bit
of
earthy
hops
in
the
end
a
bit
of
the
characteristic
harpoon
house
yeast
which
after
having
25
or
so
of
their
beers
ive
started
to
pick
up
on
taste
is
slight
breadiness
plus
some
earth
light
to
medium
body
and
nice
drinkability
medium
body
with
a
light
crisp
finish
and
flavor
thats
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
taste
wasnt
bad
but
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
i
was
disappointed
pours
a
clear
dark
copper
with
a
a
thin
light
tan
head
smells
of
ripe
bananas
taste
is
dextrin
sweetness
up
front
with
a
toasted
bread
middle
and
a
earthy
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
quite
good
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
a
good
beer
overall
like
i
said
i
had
4
i
tried
them
in
various
circumstances
and
in
each
case
it
was
a
chore
to
finish
the
bottle
bleh
drinkability
the
finish
on
this
lets
your
mouth
know
that
it
would
like
another
taste
and
sooner
than
later
it
drinks
quick
especially
on
a
nice
hot
day
harpoon
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
breweries
helped
me
get
into
craft
i
think
this
is
their
brew
for
the
masses
if
you
catch
my
drift
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
nothing
special
that
doesnt
mean
you
cant
enjoy
it
harpoon
celtic
has
a
reddish
amber
color
taste
has
a
good
malty
character
with
a
moderate
hoppiness
good
head
retention
but
the
first
taste
almost
has
a
little
too
much
head
for
my
taste
once
i
get
into
the
beer
itself
i
am
quite
pleased
this
ale
has
a
medium
body
and
is
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorites
on
draft
at
my
local
pub
d
this
is
a
nice
little
red
ale
i
would
recommend
it
good
drinking
irish
red
i
enjoyed
d
pretty
impressive
beer
overall
and
would
drink
this
one
no
problem
sweet
caramel
malts
pretty
much
complete
this
onetrick
pony
but
it
is
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
surprisingly
the
effervescent
carbonation
offsets
some
of
the
sweetness
and
there
is
a
floral
cloverleaf
bitterness
that
is
probably
at
least
half
toasty
malt
to
go
with
a
mild
hopping
rate
as
an
irish
red
it
is
pretty
lackluster
but
it
does
go
down
very
easy
and
i
must
say
you
could
choose
worse
for
a
st
pattys
day
sixer
mine
certainly
will
not
go
to
waste
notes
its
perhaps
a
little
sweet
for
the
style
but
otherwise
a
very
solid
beer
not
terribly
complex
but
tasty
a
great
session
beer
d
goes
down
easy
ok
representation
of
the
style
its
one
to
have
a
few
pints
of
but
not
necessarily
seek
out
drinkability
is
well
not
great
dont
see
having
this
one
again
might
as
well
have
a
killians
drink
well
my
friend
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
clear
redcopper
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
retains
very
well
and
laces
nicely
a
slight
citrus
aroma
but
not
much
else
very
mild
malty
and
sour
taste
good
clean
finish
goes
down
very
easy
recommended
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
great
beer
i
had
this
beer
becuase
it
was
the
only
new
one
on
draft
that
day
at
my
local
beer
bar
im
not
a
big
fan
of
irish
reds
but
as
far
as
the
style
goes
harpoons
is
quite
nice
good
redamber
color
not
much
aroma
but
a
refreshing
flavor
that
will
be
enjoyed
by
anyone
who
likes
irish
beers
and
even
those
in
the
mood
for
an
american
light
lager
i
could
drink
this
all
night
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
fairly
high
put
together
the
good
taste
light
mouthfeel
and
relatively
low
abv
drinkability
is
its
highest
rating
i
drank
about
four
of
these
all
different
sittings
before
i
decided
to
review
it
i
wasnt
too
impressed
the
first
couple
of
times
but
it
really
grew
on
me
i
dont
know
if
the
meal
i
had
with
it
today
brought
the
flavor
out
somehow
but
i
could
really
taste
the
toasted
malty
goodness
this
time
great
brew
mild
slightly
malty
aroma
a
little
sweetness
and
a
trace
of
hops
pleasant
but
not
outstanding
again
a
mild
balanced
flavor
nothing
overpowering
maltly
a
slight
hoppiness
to
the
finish
easy
drinking
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
refreshing
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
an
amber
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
crisp
malts
with
a
bit
of
hops
finishing
slightly
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
brew
d
very
drinkable
as
it
is
an
irish
red
and
that
is
the
point
of
these
beers
am
i
wrong
pours
a
clear
shimmering
bronze
that
is
beautiful
in
the
light
has
very
little
head
but
settles
to
a
white
collar
that
laces
the
top
of
the
glass
constant
streams
of
very
fine
bubbles
add
to
its
attractiveness
aromas
are
disappointingly
subdued
tending
towards
a
dull
toastiness
tastewise
light
english
hops
balance
the
bready
malts
but
the
flavors
lack
assertiveness
and
arent
very
interesting
overall
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
have
any
remarkable
qualities
as
good
an
irish
red
as
ive
had
not
that
thats
been
many
certainly
an
easy
drink
but
the
lingering
bitterness
limits
its
sessioning
potential
to
me
md
pretty
light
body
for
an
irish
red
ale
and
a
little
under
carbonated
for
my
personal
preference
it
is
smooth
on
the
palate
and
really
easy
to
drink
d
would
be
a
great
dinner
beer
and
definitely
better
than
killians
et
al
because
this
is
actually
made
with
quality
malts
and
hops
and
isnt
sodapop
carbonated
probably
great
when
running
ontap
all
night
as
well
but
more
of
a
standard
stock
irish
red
than
a
great
find
still
would
be
nice
to
see
this
instead
of
killians
on
tap
in
many
places
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
makred
best
by
051510020
probably
from
their
windsor
vermont
brewery
sampled
on
march
4
2010
the
pour
is
a
very
nice
looking
ruby
redmahogany
with
a
thin
beige
head
lots
of
beige
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
with
caramel
malts
and
some
vague
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
like
butterscotch
and
caramel
with
a
light
hoppy
ending
a
nice
take
on
the
irish
style
red
d
this
beer
is
good
but
not
great
flavors
and
aroma
fairly
muted
and
nothing
really
standouts
out
here
i
would
say
that
the
harpoon
celtic
ale
is
at
the
top
of
the
irish
eds
i
have
tried
recently
this
beer
would
definitely
be
in
my
fridge
year
round
d
pretty
good
interpretation
of
an
irish
ale
which
is
a
style
i
havent
had
too
many
of
but
the
ones
ive
had
i
liked
at
the
very
least
a
good
session
brew
that
is
definitely
an
alternative
to
the
bmcs
of
the
world
this
one
isnt
going
to
force
one
to
reminisce
or
become
introspective
of
the
brew
but
better
than
some
other
brews
that
are
considered
sessions
for
a
irish
style
ale
this
is
the
best
one
ive
had
to
date
so
far
this
is
going
to
be
my
st
patricks
day
beer
of
choice
pours
a
brilliant
almost
crystal
clear
reddish
tawny
brown
color
with
a
perfect
white
head
that
laces
well
down
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
bit
muted
smooth
caramel
and
cereal
notes
slightly
tasted
creamy
as
ever
and
nice
and
malty
slight
hops
flavor
balances
the
sweetness
enough
extremely
smooth
and
refreshing
does
well
as
it
warms
as
well
but
cold
is
perfect
this
is
a
huge
session
beer
for
red
ale
drinkers
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
kind
of
mixed
on
this
one
suspect
its
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
but
its
not
my
favorite
that
glycerine
flavor
is
a
bit
offputting
but
those
that
dont
mind
it
will
find
this
quite
drinkable
na
zdravje
overall
a
very
solid
and
well
put
together
offering
from
harpoon
would
not
mind
trying
this
again
and
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
from
them
lately
d
i
would
try
it
again
in
the
future
perhaps
it
is
interesting
i
would
never
order
up
another
celtic
ale
though
one
per
month
year
decade
is
enough
a
very
drinkable
iriish
style
lager
definitely
a
st
paddys
day
session
brew
though
i
prefer
to
mix
it
up
with
anything
else
not
naturally
green
overall
this
beer
is
just
plain
bad
i
cant
recommend
it
to
anyone
notes
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
your
basicaverage
irish
style
red
ale
its
not
bad
at
all
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
either
easy
to
drink
prefect
beer
for
a
day
of
ice
fishing
dnot
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
i
have
had
better
than
this
one
all
flavors
are
a
bit
muted
and
the
fruit
stone
aftertaste
is
not
something
i
am
into
that
said
given
a
limited
number
of
choices
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
overallgood
version
of
the
style
no
problems
with
this
beer
not
overly
creative
but
it
fits
the
style
mold
and
does
it
well
out
of
a
bottle
provided
to
me
by
my
good
friend
laura
this
beer
was
a
true
garnet
color
with
ruby
highlights
the
head
was
two
fingers
of
khaki
colored
foam
that
retained
well
as
a
thin
layer
and
left
streaks
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
toasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavors
were
misbalanced
starting
with
bitter
grains
then
slightly
too
much
of
the
sweet
malts
with
not
enough
bittering
hops
to
even
it
out
not
bad
but
awkward
the
mouthfeel
was
watery
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
was
right
on
point
for
the
style
a
one
and
done
for
me
poured
from
a
refrigeratortemperature
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
one
finger
head
of
large
tan
bubbles
quickly
dissipates
into
a
lacy
skim
across
the
top
of
the
beer
champagnelike
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
of
this
copper
colored
brew
aroma
is
of
sweet
malts
and
some
spice
the
initial
flavor
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
a
drier
finish
and
a
hint
of
hops
as
the
beer
warms
i
am
noticing
a
bitterness
that
balances
the
sweetness
there
is
a
good
amount
of
body
to
this
brew
but
the
high
carbonation
keeps
it
from
being
syrupy
or
heavy
this
is
a
deliciously
uncomplicated
beer
that
i
could
drink
many
of
poured
from
a
refrigerator
chilled
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
pretty
copper
color
with
hints
of
red
there
is
a
thick
tan
head
made
up
of
many
different
sizes
of
bubbles
it
leaves
a
patchy
spiderweb
of
lacing
as
the
head
settles
initially
there
were
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbles
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
but
they
have
quickly
disappeared
there
are
still
a
few
steams
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
has
a
slightly
spiced
malt
smell
the
beer
has
a
malty
flavor
reminiscent
of
graham
crackers
this
is
most
prevalent
in
the
finish
as
there
is
a
sweeter
flavor
up
front
that
disappears
as
you
hold
the
beer
in
your
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
strange
it
has
kind
of
a
nutty
alcohol
flavor
it
has
kind
of
a
thick
body
but
i
wouldnt
go
so
far
to
call
it
a
fullbodied
beer
the
carbonation
bubbles
feel
sharp
on
my
tongue
but
that
may
go
away
as
the
drinks
temperature
rises
the
beer
goes
down
pretty
well
its
not
an
incredible
complex
beer
so
you
dont
feel
like
you
need
to
think
much
well
drinking
it
you
can
just
enjoy
it
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
easy
drinking
and
to
share
with
friends
well
all
told
this
beer
has
potential
if
they
crank
up
the
ingredients
and
the
intensity
a
bit
i
liked
the
flavors
i
found
but
they
were
kind
of
hard
to
find
its
a
drinkable
irish
red
but
drinkable
in
that
its
not
offensive
in
any
way
shape
or
form
and
you
could
definitely
drink
several
without
being
overly
impressed
or
overly
inebriated
i
drank
the
pint
quickly
and
moved
on
to
another
more
interesting
beer
drinkability
easily
consumable
in
a
session
this
beer
seems
like
a
style
for
irish
red
fans
i
would
have
enjoyed
more
flavor
complexity
but
everything
worked
out
okay
a
few
of
these
on
a
cold
night
t
off
the
bat
it
had
a
very
sour
aftertaste
but
once
i
got
used
to
it
i
noticed
a
slightly
tart
fruitiness
to
it
it
has
a
very
dry
aftertaste
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
fan
its
a
really
ease
to
drink
beer
i
would
drink
this
aagin
and
again
cheers
d
moderate
to
high
depending
on
your
affinity
for
reds
this
is
a
solid
and
sessionable
beer
totally
worth
checking
out
if
i
saw
this
on
tap
id
get
a
pint
for
sure
eric
notes
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
normally
this
brewery
fails
to
get
my
attention
yet
this
was
great
for
sessions
with
a
good
abv
not
a
good
example
at
all
of
the
irish
red
style
stick
to
something
else
d
over
all
a
very
nice
beer
i
found
myself
at
the
bottom
sooner
than
i
expected
easy
session
beer
and
i
will
definitely
get
it
again
d
pretty
good
actually
a
sessionable
ale
this
brewery
has
yet
to
really
impress
me
this
one
falls
a
bit
short
not
bad
but
what
is
the
point
there
are
roasted
malty
grains
some
sweeter
caramels
a
bit
of
diacetyl
some
oaken
flavors
and
a
slightly
cherryish
crystal
malt
base
there
are
some
leafy
hops
present
and
just
enough
to
keep
this
from
getting
too
sweet
there
is
some
drying
tendencies
in
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
toffee
maybe
a
tad
bit
of
char
towards
the
finish
as
well
the
beer
is
good
but
not
brilliant
this
is
a
fairly
light
bodied
beer
and
none
too
taxing
on
the
palate
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
a
great
thick
and
sticky
white
head
that
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
settled
into
a
14
cap
the
brew
has
a
great
aroma
full
of
sweet
hops
and
a
balance
of
mildly
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
wonderfully
balance
and
reminds
me
of
my
time
in
ireland
there
is
a
sweetness
to
it
but
also
has
that
fullness
yet
light
in
the
mouth
the
style
really
takes
me
back
which
is
why
i
had
to
give
it
the
rating
i
did
back
then
about
6
years
ago
i
was
not
into
ba
but
i
did
write
about
the
types
of
beers
i
tried
and
this
really
brings
back
some
great
times
pours
a
golden
redorange
brown
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
some
soapy
sticking
sweet
fruity
malt
in
the
nose
i
pick
up
next
to
no
bitterness
in
aroma
very
malty
coating
nutty
coconut
leafy
herbal
hop
character
towards
the
end
of
the
quaff
not
quite
crisp
enough
to
warrant
a
refreshing
title
but
it
sure
goes
down
smooth
and
quick
its
a
good
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
drink
again
as
a
session
brew
simply
put
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
and
an
amazing
surprise
hops
apollo
willamette
clear
amber
with
a
sudsy
head
of
different
size
bubbles
that
leave
fine
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
bubblegum
malt
and
lightly
toasted
grain
tastes
good
but
too
light
in
flavor
to
make
it
stand
out
caramel
malt
and
apple
juice
nicely
balanced
by
faint
hop
bitterness
light
watery
mouthfeel
with
crisp
carbonation
an
okay
beer
that
is
a
little
light
for
an
irish
red
drinkability
easy
drinking
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
problem
i
ended
up
bumping
the
drinkability
up
because
i
finished
the
beer
with
dinner
and
the
food
stopped
the
aftertaste
i
will
drink
the
next
one
with
a
meal
d
really
really
drinkable
stuff
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
most
of
harpoons
stuff
d
a
fairly
average
beer
thats
ok
to
drink
not
the
best
beer
ive
drank
recently
but
far
from
the
worst
not
bad
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
easily
sessionable
nice
easy
flavors
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
rose
red
and
clear
has
an
anemic
whte
head
that
disappears
quickly
into
a
thin
collar
slight
laciness
aroma
has
a
lot
of
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
citruis
taste
is
sweet
and
a
i
picked
up
a
lot
of
cereal
grain
the
aftertaste
was
on
the
tart
side
light
and
thin
on
the
tongue
it
has
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
flavor
is
mediocre
i
feel
this
is
an
average
session
beer
lets
put
it
this
way
if
i
was
a
party
and
some
one
kept
handing
me
these
i
would
drink
them
all
night
and
enjoy
them
but
if
i
was
looking
for
a
six
pack
to
enjoy
for
a
night
this
wouldnt
be
one
i
would
be
looking
at
that
sums
it
up
d
notes
an
easy
drinking
pint
and
not
much
more
d
this
is
a
decent
enough
irish
red
its
fairly
well
done
with
regard
to
craft
but
theres
not
much
interesting
going
on
here
it
might
be
a
good
gateway
craft
beer
not
a
fan
of
this
one
there
are
certain
metallicchemicalish
detractors
its
a
little
harsh
as
well
with
all
these
complaints
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
botmc
the
pour
is
a
clear
brick
red
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
grassy
with
a
kick
of
hops
the
flavor
is
fruity
with
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
hibernian
is
light
bodied
with
adequete
carbonation
the
beer
is
easy
drinking
purchased
at
whole
foods
in
birmingham
looks
good
in
a
glass
with
amber
overtones
smells
earthy
with
nut
vanilla
and
caramel
in
the
mix
tastes
exactly
the
same
while
this
beer
is
smooth
and
sessionable
there
is
just
not
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
reminds
me
of
a
brown
ale
still
better
than
most
big
macros
out
there
crisp
clean
taste
slightly
hoppy
very
understated
hits
the
front
of
the
tongue
very
refreshing
on
the
palate
thin
mouth
feel
very
drinkable
a
really
good
irish
red
ale
very
smooth
and
balanced
as
the
hops
do
a
good
job
of
complimenting
the
malts
a
good
representation
of
the
style
recommended
had
a
pint
on
tap
at
goody
glovers
in
the
north
end
served
in
a
harpoon
celtic
ale
glass
reddish
orange
color
no
real
head
or
any
lacing
smelled
a
bit
doughy
taste
was
pretty
boring
slight
bit
of
citrus
fruit
and
hops
very
thin
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
memorable
i
only
ordered
it
because
i
was
in
an
irish
bar
and
i
havent
seen
it
on
tap
a
lot
a
boring
seasonal
d
easy
drinking
irish
red
nothing
over
the
top
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
would
not
seek
this
out
good
drinkability
its
soft
and
easy
not
my
favorite
harpoon
i
hope
we
get
others
the
two
leviathans
ive
had
were
awesome
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
feels
like
i
could
easly
drink
a
case
of
this
in
a
sitting
and
if
i
could
find
it
around
where
i
live
i
would
definately
buy
a
case
or
two
d
nothing
really
offensive
nothing
really
outstanding
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
back
without
thinking
too
much
average
amber
beer
nothing
too
bad
but
nothing
to
recommend
drinking
it
again
overall
decent
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
dont
understand
why
harpoon
rebranded
their
hibernian
ale
but
they
didnt
change
anything
with
the
formula
just
the
label
i
wonder
if
the
aoh
had
something
to
do
with
the
changeover
at
any
rate
still
a
nice
goto
red
during
the
late
winterearly
spring
months
drinkability
superhigh
could
have
several
of
these
thanks
to
the
tastiness
and
low
abv
happy
st
paddys
indeed
harpoons
celtic
ale
is
not
the
most
exciting
beer
but
you
could
do
a
ton
worse
its
definitely
a
solid
beer
that
should
be
really
good
on
those
cool
rainy
spring
evenings
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
more
had
i
not
been
in
a
hoppy
mood
when
i
tried
it
dont
expect
an
award
winner
but
this
is
a
decent
beer
thats
worth
trying
if
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
hops
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
a
decent
beer
but
much
better
if
someone
else
buys
it
biggest
positive
is
that
its
better
than
killians
overall
a
huge
letdown
drinkability
is
average
at
best
not
reccommended
in
fact
next
time
ill
pass
not
awful
but
i
expect
better
this
is
one
really
well
rounded
beer
pours
a
nice
head
with
some
lacing
heavy
scented
peat
flavors
on
the
nose
very
pumpkinesk
spicey
flavor
on
the
palate
quite
complex
creamy
feel
also
on
the
palate
nice
beer
to
throw
a
few
back
with
flavorful
hops
round
it
out
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
head
that
faded
with
minimal
lacing
dominate
smell
is
roasted
malt
but
i
also
get
a
hint
of
a
slightly
yeasty
aroma
as
well
taste
is
kind
of
nondescript
it
has
pretty
good
body
some
slight
bitterness
you
can
definitely
taste
the
roasted
malt
but
nothing
to
spectacular
finishes
fairly
fast
with
some
slight
drying
a
fairly
decent
beer
overall
mouthfeel
finishes
on
the
dry
side
feels
smooth
no
real
flaws
here
the
drinkability
on
this
brew
is
pretty
good
it
went
quickly
with
an
appetizer
as
mj
would
say
it
is
moreish
beer
selection
here
wasnt
great
but
i
ordered
another
one
so
that
must
be
saying
something
pours
a
bright
red
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
thin
layer
and
thick
ring
smell
is
mostly
of
bubblegum
and
circus
peanuts
i
have
usually
associated
those
with
certain
belgian
yeast
there
is
a
slight
malt
but
no
hops
present
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
slight
caramel
with
a
decent
hop
presence
the
fruity
yeast
aromas
did
not
carry
over
much
into
the
taste
but
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
the
carbonation
seems
excessive
drinkability
is
soso
the
mouthfeel
isnt
great
and
the
taste
is
a
little
off
i
might
be
able
to
stomach
a
few
of
these
but
not
going
to
revisit
any
time
soon
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
and
fruity
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crytal
malt
as
well
as
yeast
esters
its
not
overly
malty
yet
it
retains
a
minimal
caramel
sweetness
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
dull
malt
character
along
with
and
equally
dull
finish
harpoon
makes
the
same
tasting
beer
and
keeps
renaming
it
everything
is
dumbed
down
for
the
masses
its
a
easy
drink
but
its
a
very
boring
one
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
harpoon
beers
continue
to
uninspire
celtic
ale
is
the
newest
in
a
rotating
lineup
of
middle
of
the
road
beers
that
just
arent
that
good
drinkability
yeah
i
would
drink
this
again
it
is
a
safe
beer
they
didnt
take
any
real
risks
here
so
they
didnt
blow
it
on
anything
yet
harpoon
isnt
going
to
knock
anyones
socks
off
a
solid
easy
to
poker
beer
for
a
saturday
night
with
the
guys
gave
this
brew
a
try
on
tap
last
evening
it
was
poured
to
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
goodsized
white
head
had
some
legs
but
left
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
was
sweet
on
two
fronts
seemed
like
a
sweet
malt
aroma
but
also
sweet
wafts
of
fruit
imagine
it
was
the
same
thing
just
picking
up
slight
variations
but
who
the
heck
knows
the
flavor
had
a
nice
malt
presence
with
a
clear
caramel
feel
as
well
as
slight
yeast
like
breadiness
while
this
brew
was
not
overly
spectacular
it
is
well
done
and
seems
to
be
a
easy
drinking
brew
the
overcarb
and
late
alchohol
may
make
this
a
heartburn
nightmare
for
those
with
reflux
issues
but
it
still
taste
pretty
darn
good
compared
to
most
in
this
style
drinkable
there
are
other
irish
reds
i
would
prefer
to
drink
but
its
certainly
not
bad
nice
drinkable
irish
red
i
think
what
ever
happened
to
harpoon
hibernian
is
this
a
rename
or
a
completely
different
recipe
recipe
this
a
real
good
irish
red
a
seasonal
beer
that
is
well
bodied
and
has
a
nice
even
feel
to
it
nice
looking
beer
a
nice
copper
color
with
nice
head
to
it
and
lots
of
ascending
bubbles
smell
is
very
much
of
caramel
and
malts
nice
smell
taste
is
little
simple
but
solid
again
hints
of
caramel
but
a
little
too
macro
tasting
as
a
previous
reviewer
stated
reminds
me
of
bud
american
ale
nothing
great
but
a
nice
solid
drinker
this
beer
has
a
nice
amber
color
to
it
the
smell
is
pretty
subtle
but
the
malts
are
a
little
more
noticable
than
the
hops
the
taste
was
very
good
and
consisted
of
a
good
balance
between
malts
and
hops
a
nice
wheat
flavor
also
poked
through
with
a
breadcarrot
cake
type
of
a
flavor
it
finishes
pretty
smooth
and
is
a
pretty
good
beer
in
my
opinion
light
bodied
creamy
feel
i
feels
more
substantial
than
it
probably
is
for
lack
of
a
better
term
drinkable
but
limited
d
this
is
easy
to
drink
although
its
somewhat
thin
and
onedimensional
like
many
other
harpoon
offerings
its
a
bit
above
average
across
the
board
but
nothing
stellar
drinkability
decent
enough
irish
red
but
nothing
really
special
at
all
it
looks
really
good
but
the
taste
falls
short
taste
is
malty
sweet
and
pretty
clean
not
much
in
the
hop
department
but
enough
to
balance
this
one
out
pretty
good
so
im
at
the
beer
store
and
im
picking
up
a
couple
of
beers
id
been
looking
for
and
there
in
the
cooler
is
this
harppon
celtic
ale
cant
recall
seeing
this
before
so
i
figured
why
not
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
a
solid
white
head
taste
is
malt
tea
and
an
oxidized
note
light
bodied
and
proably
if
it
had
not
come
across
as
oxidized
it
wouldve
been
nice
with
dinner
d
ok
but
wouldnt
rush
out
to
buy
a
sixer
of
this
anytime
soon
drinkable
but
not
really
exciting
drinkability
is
good
nice
contrast
to
darkcolored
macros
calling
themselves
irish
reds

pours
an
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
easy
drinking
but
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
i
thought
it
might
be
could
be
because
i
was
overpowered
by
smuttynose
barleywine
last
night
and
this
now
seems
watery
either
way
the
flavor
was
sweet
with
some
malts
good
but
not
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
slight
spiciness
bitterness
fruit
light
and
drinkable
with
a
lot
of
flavor
one
of
the
best
reds
ive
had
in
a
while
and
definitely
a
good
take
on
the
style
i
love
celtic
crosses
staffs
very
cool
too
bad
this
is
only
a
season
beer
d
nothing
special
here
easy
drinker
its
drinkable
pours
a
nice
red
color
with
good
head
and
some
very
nice
lacing
very
light
scent
a
good
malty
sweetness
but
its
not
very
strong
good
taste
a
nice
malty
flavor
with
good
sweet
overtones
and
a
slightly
sour
finish
goes
down
fine
if
a
little
over
carbonated
not
a
bad
irish
red
a
nice
seasonal
pours
a
deep
orangered
color
a
decent
amount
of
foam
sticking
to
the
glass
smells
of
malt
and
some
fruit
tasted
of
malt
and
sweet
fruit
and
a
whole
bunch
of
other
flavorsmostly
some
apple
cider
sticking
out
a
bit
just
a
tad
too
much
apple
for
me
but
other
than
that
its
a
fine

nothing
earthshattering
a
nice

nothing

good

more
than

nicely
with
an
amber
color
and
nice
roasted
smell
good
flavor
with
medium
drinkability
id
suggest
sam
adams
irish
red
before
this
one
taste
is
malty
upfront
slight
hop
bitterness
nothing
too
complex
for
this
red
ale
easy
going
down
with
a
good
carbonation
level
overall
quite
the
drinkable
beer
drinks
very
similar
to
my
current
scottish
ale
that
i
brewed
up
recently
solid
malt
flavors
and
low
hop
presence
a
solid
offering
drinkability
the
main
problem
with
this
beer
is
if
you
told
me
it
was
killians
i
wouldve
believed
you
which
isnt
really
a
good
thing
especially
from
someone
like
harpoon
even
though
i
have
had
many
mediocre
brews
from
them
that
said
this
is
still
pretty
unimpressive
i
think
harpoon
needs
to
do
their
single
barrel
series
and
make
it
more
widely
available
id
like
to
see
some
experimentation
otherwise
ill
pay
two
dollars
less
and
order
a
pint
of
killians
d
standup
job
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
be
satisfied
recommendation
on
this
one
for
sure
a
lot
of
flavor
to
soak
in
here
for
a
normal
strength
beer
a
sensible
seasonal
on
their
part
for
the
boston
area
this
ended
up
being
a
more
than
just
a
decent
beer
d
this
is
definitely
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
does
really
stand
out
much
for
me
only
slightly
better
than
average
d
not
bad
id
certainly
have
again
would
drink
again
pours
a
dark
amber
dark
caramel
color
with
just
a
quarter
inch
of
offwhite
head
excellent
clarity
a
very
buttery
lightly
toasty
aroma
comes
through
with
some
toffee
like
character
as
well
an
almost
oaked
vanilla
note
as
well
kind
of
strange
on
the
palate
a
complex
malt
profile
comes
through
a
range
of
orange
bready
biscuit
and
toffee
notes
are
in
there
finishing
slightly
smoky
and
floral
with
a
burnt
bitter
feel
the
roastiness
of
this
beer
is
deceptive
given
its
light
shade
but
overall
an
interesting
beer
definitely
a
session
beer
but
a
little
heavy
for
my
taste
appearance
copper
amber
in
color
one
finger
tan
head
and
some
lacing
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
head
retention
though
smell
caramel
and
malt
thats
about
it
taste
caramel
malt
grain
and
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
to
balance
mouthfeel
a
bit
light
in
body
mediem
carbonation
drinkability
a
nice
beer
to
share
a
evening
with
friends
d
good
fairly
light
in
abv
5
4
and
no
heavy
flavors
helped
this
one
go
down
pretty
easily
though
personally
id
prefer
a
little
less
bigbubbled
carbonation
to
make
it
smoother
and
creamier
i
consider
this
one
great
irish
red
ale
an
all
around
good
beer
from
start
to
finish
verdict
a
highly
drinkable
irish
red
ale
its
what
i
expect
from
harpoon
and
perfect
for
the
spring
season
md
mouthfeel
is
solid
medium
weight
with
light
but
persistent
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
wish
there
were
just
a
bit
more
character
in
the
taste
but
this
is
very
enjoyable
just
the
same
drinkability
pretty
good
beer
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
one
after
another
i
would
recommend
it
d
i
like
this
one
nothing
stands
out
by
itself
in
this
brew
and
i
think
thats
a
good
thing
wellbalanced
all
the
way
through
no
off
flavors
or
metallic
taste
for
me
either
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
d
overall
its
a
nothing
great
the
flavors
in
the
beer
goes
together
well
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
too
many
of
these
because
i
didnt
like
it
that
much
because
of
the
metallic
taste
yet
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
12
ounce
bottle
says
best
before
5108
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
reddishcopper
color
with
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
it
smells
like
caramel
malt
breadgrain
and
a
bit
of
hops
aroma
is
nice
but
a
bit
weak
luckily
the
taste
is
stronger
than
the
aroma
is
it
tastes
like
toffee
caramel
toasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
in
the
finish
but
its
a
mostly
malty
sweet
beer
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
chewiness
drinkability
is
good
too
the
smoothness
makes
it
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
choice
as
a
session
beer
imo
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
id
buy
it
again
very
drinkable
but
not
the
best
red
ale
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
singlefinger
orangey
tan
head
the
smell
is
pretty
weak
with
maybe
some
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
very
akin
to
a
sweet
bread
the
malts
provide
sweetness
all
the
way
through
with
perhaps
just
a
hint
of
hops
towards
the
middle
before
it
finishes
with
even
more
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
i
expected
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
this
would
make
for
a
nice
desert
beer
but
i
couldnt
really
imagine
grabbing
more
than
one
or
two
at
a
time
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
red
with
a
nice
frothy
head
that
retains
pretty
well
smell
is
very
sweet
and
earthy
kind
of
a
tang
to
the
aroma
as
well
taste
is
more
sweet
malts
but
rather
thin
in
the
middle
and
finish
slight
bitter
hop
finish
slightly
metallic
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
would
like
good
carbonation
and
slightly
dry
finish
fairly
drinkable
but
was
kinda
let
down
by
this
one
d
this
one
comes
across
as
average
glad
i
got
to
try
it
this
would
not
be
my
first
choice
of
beverage
but
still
not
too
bad
though
pours
a
dark
amber
with
red
highlights
and
a
nice
offwhite
head
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
it
smells
of
nice
roasted
malts
and
hops
good
aroma
for
an
irish
red
the
taste
is
pretty
good
a
nice
sweet
and
malty
base
finishing
off
with
some
eathier
hops
not
bad
for
an
irish
red
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
still
a
good
beer
though
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
beer
like
this
it
is
also
pretty
drinkable
as
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
and
i
would
probably
get
this
again
another
bonus
from
a
guy
at
work
who
says
hey
i
got
4
cases
of
assorted
brews
here
want
any
well
yeah
smells
like
caramel
and
molasses
pours
to
a
dark
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
trace
head
taste
is
thick
and
creamy
almost
chewy
with
a
sweet
start
and
a
semi
bitter
finish
the
bitterness
is
sharp
but
doesnt
linger
in
the
aftertaste
this
starts
out
like
an
english
ale
but
definitely
finishes
as
an
irish
style
amber
well
balanced
so
far
typical
of
harpoon
brews
and
that
adds
to
a
very
high
drinkability
this
is
a
sessionor
without
a
doubt
something
new
in
my
supermarket
was
this
pours
a
clear
brownishamber
w
a
fluffy
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
moderate
lacing
in
my
pint
very
light
smell
some
hints
of
crystal
malts
and
vinous
alcohol
present
as
well
taste
is
a
bit
thin
as
well
but
rounded
out
by
a
grainy
flavor
and
some
hop
flavor
as
well
tastes
of
poss
adjuncts
linger
underneath
toasted
malt
w
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
a
bit
out
of
style
a
bit
thick
for
an
irish
red
but
not
cloying
not
much
co2
not
on
my
top
10
but
id
drink
it
again
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
touch
of
red
a
fair
amount
of
head
and
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
nose
i
got
a
touch
of
peach
and
a
slight
sweet
edge
the
taste
is
earthy
and
full
there
are
the
typical
hops
and
roasted
malt
on
the
mouth
and
the
feel
is
a
little
bit
thick
but
good
overall
a
nice
brew
worth
trying
i
suppose
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
though
drinkability
a
fairly
average
irish
ale
thats
all
im
saying
drinkabke
very
got
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
with
johnnnniee
thanks
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
may
07
so
slightly
past
date
but
not
too
much
was
within
date
when
i
got
but
was
sitting
in
back
of
fridge
had
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
thin
collar
had
a
small
fountain
of
carb
in
the
center
of
the
glass
was
dark
copper
amber
in
color
the
aroma
was
solid
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
caramel
not
bad
but
didnt
really
excite
the
taste
was
pretty
good
for
a
ira
good
and
solid
from
start
to
finish
i
find
iras
to
not
be
extremely
flavorful
but
what
they
do
have
hits
the
spot
and
doesnt
disappoint
not
exciting
but
satisfying
sorta
like
my
wife
in
its
own
way
mouthfeel
was
solid
with
right
amount
of
carb
overall
a
good
session
beer
that
worth
trying
if
you
can
easily
get
your
hands
on
preferably
from
a
buddys
fridge
and
not
your
own
pocket

pretty
drinkable
not
really
what
i
would
chose
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
not
bad
pours
s
reddish
copper
color
nice
and
clear
with
a
nice
pillowy
cream
colored
head
retains
a
nice
film
with
some
sticky
lacing
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
is
of
caramel
and
biscuity
malts
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
the
same
malt
characters
as
the
nose
and
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
to
balance
out
the
back
end
also
a
bit
of
nutty
flavor
nice
light
mouthfeel
with
a
very
clean
dry
finish
overall
while
there
is
no
wow
factor
with
this
brew
its
a
really
solid
enjoyable
red
ale
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
nice
amber
red
color
with
a
soft
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
mildly
fruity
with
a
little
pastry
dough
good
caramel
and
biscuit
malt
character
with
mild
hop
bitterness
somewhat
dry
and
nutty
finish
a
good
beer
to
have
right
after
work
i
wish
i
saw
this
at
more
bars
than
killians
this
would
be
delicious
on
cask
ill
bet
i
really
liked
this
clear
red
body
with
nice
white
head
smell
is
very
nutty
and
malty
taste
is
the
same
nutty
is
what
i
notice
with
a
nice
malt
backing
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
low
carbonation
very
smooth
like
most
irish
reds
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
i
reccomend
it
to
those
who
enjoy
smooth
and
nutty
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
decent
representation
of
style
it
isnt
the
best
beer
that
ive
had
in
the
style
but
its
still
very
good
theres
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
but
its
enjoyable
in
its
simplicity
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
it
seems
like
i
could
guzzle
one
after
another
something
i
usually
wouldnt
do
a
bit
bland
but
very
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
sheer
slickness
of
this
beer
in
the
mouth
is
fantastic
but
its
also
a
bit
too
active
and
gassy
the
malts
really
deliver
on
this
one
and
id
highly
recommend
anyone
at
least
try
it
d
i
enjoyed
this
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
i
will
likely
buy
this
again
i
would
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
crossover
beer
for
folks
new
to
the
world
of
craft
beers
as
well
as
a
solid
session
beer
for
craft
veterans
in
many
respects
im
sorry
that
this
is
only
a
spring
seasonal
as
id
definitely
prefer
it
as
an
alternative
to
the
many
summer
wheat
beers
drinkability
this
was
st
pattys
day
beer
along
with
my
other
choices
that
i
bought
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
i
had
lost
a
lot
of
faith
in
harpoon
and
really
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
im
not
going
to
lie
i
really
dig
this
beer
this
will
more
than
likely
be
my
st
patricks
day
beer
it
may
not
wow
you
but
this
beer
really
preaches
the
beauty
of
simplicity
this
went
down
incredibly
easily
and
definitely
could
be
sessioned
especially
with
some
munchies
nothing
spectacular
but
a
good
enjoyable
beer
i
could
definitely
see
this
being
a
yearly
session
when
its
available
and
again
would
probably
be
better
surrounded
by
good
friends
at
the
pub
with
some
appetizers
while
i
wont
be
buying
a
case
of
it
i
would
drink
it
again
in
a
minute
given
the
right
setting
if
youre
in
that
setting
give
it
a
shot
taste
is
also
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
there
are
hints
of
caramel
grain
and
maybe
a
slight
hop
presence
but
overall
the
flavor
is
uneven
and
a
bit
bland
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
this
beer
is
sessionable
but
that
sour
aftertaste
kind
of
kills
your
desire
for
more
this
isnt
an
awful
beer
just
not
a
very
good
one
either
average
at
best
pours
a
rustyorange
hue
with
brass
highlights
and
pristine
clarity
dense
pale
biege
threefinger
head
sinks
to
a
marshmallow
fluff
cap
shows
decent
retention
and
leaves
spotty
lacing
english
hop
and
munich
malt
nose
nothing
offensive
but
nothing
impressive
either
toasted
pale
malt
sweetness
is
backed
by
dextrinous
graininess
in
the
first
sip
a
deeply
earthenherbal
hop
flavor
balances
while
leaving
the
aftertaste
slightly
dry
but
retaining
a
fair
caramel
taste
lightmediumthinnish
body
gains
some
texture
from
dextrin
which
gives
it
a
pleasent
tannic
bite
although
not
quite
astringnet
the
mouthfeel
is
mild
but
flavorful
with
medium
carbonation
finishes
biscuity
with
a
comfortable
level
of
residual
sugar
and
mild
english
hop
flavor
quite
a
nice
session
beer
highly
drinkable
with
a
very
agreeable
expression
of
stye
i
recently
was
introduced
to
harpoons
hibernator
by
mistake
and
i
have
to
say
i
really
enjoyed
it
it
was
presented
to
me
as
an
ipa
but
it
was
really
a
red
ale
i
was
expecting
an
ipa
and
i
found
my
first
sip
not
only
to
be
a
surprise
but
a
pleasant
surprise
it
was
really
smooth
and
tasty
it
was
a
nice
pour
with
a
rich
foamy
head
the
aroma
was
a
nice
mix
of
fruit
and
caramel
but
not
overpowering
it
went
down
very
easily
light
tasty
and
very
drinkable
even
though
i
was
looking
for
an
ipa
i
ended
up
sticking
with
this
one
for
the
whole
time
i
was
there
there
was
no
aftertaste
and
it
was
easy
on
the
pallet
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
next
time
not
a
bad
taste
just
not
enough
to
make
me
want
another
this
is
a
definite
st
pattys
day
beer
a
good
go
at
the
irish
red
style
reminds
me
of
smithwicks
but
less
creamy
than
im
used
too
thatd
probably
be
fixed
by
a
nitro
pour
but
anyways
seems
a
little
light
in
body
for
a
craft
beer
but
i
think
that
goes
with
the
style
theres
a
mellow
ester
flavor
from
the
yeast
plus
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
little
tang
almost
seems
closer
to
a
lager
for
some
reason
anyways
if
you
want
an
irish
red
session
beer
get
a
6er
or
order
a
pint
poured
a
crisp
clear
red
with
a
quickly
diminishing
head
aroma
is
somewhat
malty
with
a
bit
of
fruitiness
but
not
too
much
taste
holds
up
to
the
style
very
well
good
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
decently
drinkable
beer
for
the
style
pours
a
nice
red
amber
with
a
slight
off
white
head
the
smell
is
unoffending
and
slightly
sweet
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
didnt
really
get
my
attention
right
away
but
after
a
couple
of
glasses
from
the
growler
it
really
started
to
grow
on
me
the
taste
is
really
well
balanced
with
a
real
smooth
finish
almost
honey
like
i
think
this
is
a
real
solid
beer
very
smooth
very
middle
of
the
road
and
very
appealing
to
the
masses
i
dig
it
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
and
decent
lacing
looks
very
appealing
smells
like
tea
with
lemony
notes
a
bit
of
fruitiness
and
a
decent
sweet
malty
backbone
taste
is
also
a
bit
like
tea
but
more
muted
than
the
nose
a
sweet
lightly
toasted
malt
backbone
and
the
appearance
of
bittering
hops
in
the
finish
serve
to
round
out
this
beer
very
well
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
with
decent
body
and
carbonation
as
for
drinkability
im
somewhat
conflicted
on
one
hand
this
is
a
tasty
brew
that
isnt
too
heavy
on
the
other
i
just
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
two
maybe
three
in
a
sitting
and
for
me
that
says
something
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
certainly
something
id
have
if
i
had
a
few
other
beers
to
drink
12oz
bottle
from
shaws
amberred
translucent
body
with
a
little
less
than
an
inch
of
light
tan
head
smells
of
malt
and
floral
hops
biscuit
and
caramel
malt
with
some
floral
hop
to
support
it
creamy
full
mouthfeel
pretty
good
ale
nice
malty
ale
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
dark
center
and
bright
caramel
edges
only
a
collar
of
head
remains
after
a
few
minutes
aroma
is
definitely
on
the
butterscotchy
diacetyl
side
of
things
although
some
nutty
malts
and
fruity
hops
poke
through
in
spite
the
diacetyl
intensity
the
palate
the
palate
ok
im
usually
ok
with
a
bit
of
diacetyl
in
my
english
style
ales
but
this
is
ridiculous
diacetyl
in
the
front
mid
and
finish
along
with
some
acidity
first
off
and
some
grapefruity
notes
at
the
midpalate
but
those
last
two
things
are
overwhelmed
by
the
big
d
the
finish
dries
out
quickly
mouthfeel
is
pretty
fullbodied
with
good
medium
carbonation
that
fills
things
out
overall
this
beer
has
only
the
minor
trappings
of
a
successful
one
looks
mouthfeel
its
kind
of
like
a
hot
girl
who
looks
great
and
feels
great
in
all
the
right
places
but
cant
carry
on
a
conversation
and
has
poison
for
a
soul
this
is
an
abject
failure
of
a
beer
imo
i
can
only
see
someone
enjoying
this
is
they
either
a
have
a
strange
diacetyl
fixation
or
b
are
blissfully
unaware
that
the
stuff
exists
beer
pours
with
a
nice
thick
head
that
eventually
settles
to
a
thin
rim
beer
has
some
lacing
which
follows
the
beer
down
the
glass
there
is
a
metallic
smell
present
maybe
a
skunky
batch
otherwise
the
smell
is
of
amber
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
no
metallic
taste
is
present
taste
is
of
amber
malt
and
a
nice
honey
like
aftertaste
is
present
the
beer
is
balanced
well
and
is
rather
light
in
body
almost
watery
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
either
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
you
could
drink
two
on
a
hot
day
sweet
and
malty
at
first
followed
by
a
hop
kick
midsip
that
is
at
times
piney
floral
malts
creep
back
in
for
the
finish
with
a
figcaramel
quality
this
beer
was
looking
pretty
good
up
untill
i
tasted
it
it
is
about
the
color
of
a
glass
of
tea
there
was
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
taste
is
just
too
harsh
there
is
a
negative
bitterness
that
cannot
be
overlooked
it
kills
the
entire
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
average
at
best
i
could
not
drink
this
beer
again
there
are
much
better
red
beers
overall
i
expected
a
little
more
hop
presence
with
the
style
but
malt
pretty
much
dominated
the
flavor
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
after
one
i
switched
to
something
with
more
flavor
pours
light
red
pretty
translucent
moderate
to
light
carbonation
not
much
head
smell
is
rather
light
with
hints
of
florals
taste
is
not
powerful
mild
malts
hints
of
hops
caramels
as
well
easy
going
down
good
if
you
want
to
down
a
few
quickly
quick
and
rather
enjoyable
taste
is
all
about
malt
with
a
caramel
overtone
very
subdued
hop
flavor
not
a
bad
drinking
brew
but
not
exciting
enough
to
want
me
running
back
for
more
probably
a
good
macro
cross
over
beer
happy
st
patricks
to
all
this
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
a
little
lace
and
a
little
film
the
smell
is
faint
with
sweet
malts
the
taste
is
malty
caramel
up
front
with
some
bitterness
coming
through
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
with
good
carbonation
overall
moderately
drinkable
but
not
the
best
irish
red
ale
out
there
i
dont
know
a
decent
beer
but
sort
of
a
mor
red
ale
aimed
more
for
the
macro
crowd
that
is
willing
maybe
try
a
micro
decent
but
not
my
favorite
from
this
great
brewery
this
could
possibly
make
a
good
intro
beer
for
getting
someone
into
craft
beers
pleasant
unoffensive
very
smooth
and
definitely
easy
to
drink
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
light
and
under
carbonated
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
id
stongly
recommend
it
to
anyone
especially
those
who
likes
irish
red
ales
an
nice
take
on
the
irish
red
style
this
beer
poured
a
nice
rich
redstraw
color
though
to
be
honest
the
place
was
kinda
dark
not
much
in
the
way
of
head
only
some
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
plastic
cup
the
taste
was
a
nice
and
smooth
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
but
with
a
nice
malt
characteristic
all
in
all
this
would
be
a
welcome
addition
to
my
st
patricks
day
party
a
nice
full
amber
color
a
big
beautiful
head
that
was
an
off
white
and
lasted
for
quite
a
while
i
know
we
arent
supposed
to
mention
this
but
i
love
the
artwork
on
the
bottle
itself
the
smell
was
the
worst
aspect
of
the
beer
im
sure
this
sounds
nuts
to
a
lot
of
you
and
probably
extremely
naive
but
i
dont
like
it
when
a
beer
smells
like
alcohol
it
had
a
delicious
flavor
but
was
not
very
carbonated
other
than
that
i
liked
it
very
much
it
was
quite
smooth
going
down
and
left
a
pleasant
aftertaste
overall
id
say
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
but
id
probably
have
another
if
the
opportunity
arises
drinkability
i
could
drink
an
entire
6pack
of
this
without
realizing
it
its
that
tasty
harpoon
hibernian
ale
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
with
some
spicy
notes
maybe
a
little
grassy
as
well
taste
is
bready
and
malty
with
a
slight
tang
and
a
slightly
dry
but
not
hoppy
finish
light
mouthfeel
fairly
highly
carbonated
a
good
solid
red
ale
very
drinkable
not
an
awesome
beer
but
i
have
yet
to
find
a
red
ale
that
is
this
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
smallish
tan
head
the
smell
is
very
maltybut
not
much
else
the
taste
is
clearcrisp
and
malty
the
flavor
has
some
nut
and
brown
sugar
to
itbut
the
malt
rules
this
beer
the
mf
is
light
and
ends
with
a
slight
watery
aftertaste
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
from
harpoon
and
id
try
it
again
one
of
the
better
irish
reds
that
i
have
had
not
being
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
was
skeptical
has
a
bold
toasted
malt
aroma
with
and
underriding
hop
scent
and
moderately
spiced
nice
strong
malt
flavor
that
hits
on
toasty
dates
nuts
and
a
light
brown
sugar
flavor
hops
balance
out
the
sweetness
well
while
lending
a
mild
bitterness
and
spice
flavor
other
spices
such
as
nutmeg
and
ginger
the
body
is
medium
and
balanced
finishes
lightly
sweet
with
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
lingering
malt
flavor
pretty
good
stuff
this
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
given
the
style
description
on
ba
for
the
irish
red
ale
not
really
for
me
though
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
bubbley
bordering
on
creamy
slick
near
the
end
very
nice
id
say
this
is
pretty
darned
drinkable
its
tasty
and
not
too
heavy
it
wont
sneak
up
on
you
assuming
it
sticks
to
style
and
is
around
5
and
is
pleasurable
to
drink
a
good
beer
this
is
the
strangest
red
ale
ive
ever
tried
imagine
was
iipa
is
to
pale
ale
hibernian
is
to
red
ale
somehow
harpoon
isolated
the
red
beer
flavor
and
magnified
x100
lovely
crystal
clear
dark
burnt
red
good
muddy
head
too
smell
and
taste
quite
overwhelming
with
the
irish
red
ale
malts
the
taste
gets
to
you
after
a
while
and
not
in
a
good
way
a
nice
beer
to
visit
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
every
day
pours
with
an
effervescent
1finger
tan
head
that
quickly
fizzles
away
body
is
a
pleasing
clear
copper
with
very
subtle
red
highlights
there
was
no
lacing
nose
is
sweet
with
caramel
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
spicey
hoppage
good
carbonation
up

body
is
mediumfull
on
the
tongue
surprisingly
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
indicates
nicely
balanced
caramel
and
spicey
nugget
hop
goes
down
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
and
lingering
spicyness
quality
but
a
pretty
boring
recipe
not
interesting
enough
to
want
to
pack
a
second
into
a
session
hops
nugget
drinkability
perfectly
adequate
red
ale
but
nothing
special
really
popped
into
my
head
while
drinking
it
this
beer
pours
a
one
and
a
half
finger
creamy
offwhite
head
that
persists
for
a
decent
while
it
strongly
laces
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
ale
dissappears
the
brew
is
deadon
style
copper
color
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
is
evident
to
the
eye
my
nose
picks
up
sweet
malt
and
a
light
floral
hop
smell
this
beer
starts
mildly
sweet
and
finishes
mildly
dry
and
bitter
this
beer
does
everything
a
bit
too
mildly
this
is
really
good
stuff
but
it
seems
could
be
great
with
just
a
little
more
umph
in
all
departments
hibernian
irish
style
red
ale
is
a
fairly
lackluster
offering
from
a
brewery
that
is
new
to
me
or
at
least
to
my
taste
buds
i
know
better
than
to
judge
harpoon
by
one
beer
and
will
have
no
trouble
trying
other
offerings
as
i
run
across
them
for
instance
theres
an
interesting
little
creation
called
triticus
brewed
by
two
brothers
who
know
a
thing
or
ten
about
beer
that
ive
been
itching
to
try
poured
a
deep
copper
color
with
large
offwhite
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
faint
hint
of
hops
taste
is
pleasant
but
nothing
outstanding
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
finish
let
a
mild
dry
taste
in
the
mouth
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
both
nothing
outstanding
unfortunately
harpoon
seems
like
one
of
those
brewers
that
just
doesnt
live
up
to
their
potential
the
beers
are
consistent
and
wellmade
but
the
flavor
just
is
not
there
on
a
lot
of
them
seems
to
me
they
could
easily
be
a
glbc
or
bells
caliber
brewer
if
they
would
just
decide
they
wanted
all
their
beers
to
be
less
boring
anyway
this
killiansish
beer
is
clear
amber
with
a
thin
ivorycolored
head
and
minimal
lacing
caramel
and
malt
aroma
mediumbodied
and
dry
with
malt
caramel
and
light
nut
flavor
the
finish
is
short
and
hoppy
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
again
there
should
be
more
to
this
body
is
medium
light
with
sodalike
carbonation
with
a
smooth
and
slick
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
but
forgettable
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
well
balanced
beer
i
consider
it
middle
of
the
road
in
regards
to
flavor
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
the
harpoon
brewery
poured
from
a
bottle
the
head
fizzes
out
fairly
quickly
there
is
a
halfmoon
ring
on
one
side
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
good
well
above
average
anyway
a
little
bit
fruity
black
cherries
malty
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
here
but
it
has
a
clean
taste
and
smell
a
good
pub
ale
for
sure
i
like
most
of
harpoons
beers
and
this
one
is
a
good
example
of
why
it
isnt
outrageously
estery
malty
or
hoppy
it
is
however
true
to
its
style
this
beer
pours
a
copper
color
and
produces
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
of
light
malt
the
taste
contained
a
bready
maltiness
and
had
hints
of
cherry
and
banana
which
yielded
to
bitter
citrus
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
balanced
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
exactly
earthshattering
overall
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
im
slightly
disappointed
and
cant
really
recommend
it
as
its
not
much
of
an
improvement
over
killians
poors
a
red
amber
with
an
offwhite
headskie

with

cant
quite

it

also

some
other
clean

flavor
i
cant
identify
sort
of
a
burnt

candied
apple
flavor
but
that
desciption
doesnt
quite
do
it
justice
fairly
light
mouthfeel
with
prickly

good
drinkability
a
pleasant
tasty
beer
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
good
but
unremarkable
quite
drinkable
due
to
how
light
this
red
is
a
pretty
average
version
of
the
style
what
i
was
expecting
from
harpoon
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
feels
nice
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
very
drinkable
balanced
ale
pours
reddishsuprise
amber
slight
white
head
clear
and
no

sort
of
nondescript
beer
for
my
liking
this
is
a
semi
sweet
brew
i
also
pick
up
a
little
ginger
or
mint
this
just
too
dull
a
brew
for
me
no
real
character
nor
of
much
interest
my
wife
liked
it
she
said
this
is
much
better
then
all
that
crazy
strong
beer
you
like
what
can
i
say
i
like
crazy
strong
flavorful
beer
with
some
character
i
wont
buy
this
red
ale
stuff
again
anytime
soon
overall
this
a
nice
spring
seasonal
by
a
local
brewery
this
one
pours
a
somewhat
transparent
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
ring
the
beer
the
nose
is
a
very
dirty
earthy
hop
i
dont
reallyl
ike
it
the
flavor
is
bad
there
is
a
funkey
sweetness
on
the
finish
that
follows
a
dirty
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
drinkability
is
pretty
bad
i
dont
really
want
to
finish
this
one
this
poured
out
clean
clear
and
was
an
orangeyamber
color
a
large
persistent
head
of
foam
rose
out
of
the
beer
and
left
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
semisweet
with
buttery
malts
and
bitter
orange
notes
the
taste
is
buttery
smooth
and
flavorful
this
goes
down
extremely
easy
the
body
is
solid
and
the
finish
is
clean
and
leaves
a
pleasant
tartness
in
the
throat
the
draft
version
was
good
but
this
might
be
even
better
i
might
try
it
if
i
found
it
on
tap
otherwise
not
interested
the
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
while
it
had
the
bitter
foretaste
the
aroma
promised
it
mellowed
out
much
too
quickly
this
was
a
good
average
drinking
beer
but
overall
i
wsnt
impressed
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
another
clear
coppery
amber
in
hue
with
a
modest
tawny
highlight
no
animation
the
white
head
reached
a
half
finger
in
height
the
head
retention
was
excellent
as
it
sat
like
concrete
and
it
had
the
same
staying
power
the
subsequent
lacing
amounted
to
zilch
still
this
is
a
goodlooking
beer
the
nose
is
way
too
clean
this
is
an
ale
right
faint
whiffs
of
nuts
and
trace
amounts
of
caramel
maltiness
can
be
found
once
i
worked
at
it
a
little
the
lack
of
smell
removes
any
hope
of
an
invitation
true
the
nose
is
inoffensive
but
it
is
so
damn
lackluster
it
is
time
to
taste
even
without
an
invite
bland
palate
i
could
end
my
comments
on
the
taste
right
there
but
i
will
elaborate
a
little
first
of
all
where
is
the
biscuitlike
maltiness
hell
id
settle
for
some
yummy
caramel
notes
all
i
get
out
of
this
beer
is
hints
of
nuts
some
grassiness
a
moderate
bite
of
bitterness
at
the
back
and
a
large
dose
of
cleanliness
how
boring
im
not
impressed
frankly
it
is
too
bland
to
be
offensive
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
the
carbonation
is
modestly
high
but
it
seems
fitting
medium
in
body
but
it
could
use
more
malt
not
only
for
bulk
but
also
for
flavor
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
since
nothing
bothers
to
tickle
the
tastebuds
before
reaching
the
throat
this
is
a
very
very
run
of
the
mill
amber
ale
nothing
about
it
is
memorable
in
a
positive
light
anyway
i
can
think
of
dozens
of
ambers
id
pick
over
this
one
regardless
i
never
would
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
if
it
wasnt
for
drweizen
and
bif
5
thanks
taste
is
above
average
but
unimpressive
caramel
and
bready
malts
dominate
with
a
balancing
floralherbal
hops
presence
that
provides
enough
bitterness
to
give
this
decent
drinkability
not
one
of
the
better
harpoon
brews
ive
tried
but
its
not
bad
just
average
pure
nastiness
this
is
horrid
stuff
another
dumper
from
the
folks
at
harpoon
after
4
brews
from
this
brewery
i
have
no
interest
in
ever
having
their
beer
again
and
will
warn
my
friends
to
stay
away
down
the
drain
it
goes
avoid
at
all
cost
it
is
ruby
colored
with
a
brownish
tint
and
an
offwhite
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
some
malt
and
caramel
banana
and
cherry
are
among
the
fruity
flavors
i
detect
with
the
esters
the
medium
to
full
body
has
little
to
hop
character
but
there
is
a
bitterness
that
helps
balance
out
the
maltiness
an
easy
drinker
but
not
my
favorite
theres
something
alluring
about
the
appearance
of
red
ale
harpoons
has
smooth
complex
flavor
thats
a
little
bitter
with
overtones
of
caramel
and
hops
the
smell
isnt
so
great
its
as
if
the
beer
has
gone
a
bit
bad
but
thats
misleading
the
carbonation
is
just
about
right
all
of
which
makes
this
a
fine
beer
for
repeated
offerings
while
ales
are
not
usually
my
type
of
beer
i
found
this
too
be
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
appearance
good
aroma
good
taste
and
a
lasting
impression
if
you
get
a
chance
try
this
beer
great
little
spring
brew
ill
definitely
get
some
more
very
nice
spring
beer
it
was
a
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
that
left
a
little
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
faint
malty
aroma
but
not
much
overall
great
tasting
with
the
malts
most
notable
but
a
good
balance
of
hops
too
high
drinkability
wouldnt
have
minded
having
a
couple
of
these
went
great
with
my
halibut
dinner
pours
a
nice
caramel
ruby
amber
tone
forms
nice
caramel
tan
off
white
head
forms
a
collar
of
lace
around
my
pint
not
bad
eh
aromatics
going
on
instantly
are
caramel
nut
toasted
malts
with
very
appetising
fruit
tones
dancing
around
in
there
mild
hop
dosage
what
an
amber
should
be
except
for
hopback
a
very
strong
malt
backbone
compromises
the
main
taste
here
with
some
fruit
almost
sugary
fruit
notes
and
toasty
malts
nice
mix
mild
hop
bitterness
nice
amber
ale
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
very
reserved
carbonation
nice
beer
drinkability
factor
here
yeah
i
could
enjoy
few
of
these
beauties
without
a
problem
light
bitterness
light
to
medium
feel
interesting
spring
seasonal
i
like
it
in
a
half
and
half
with
guinness
pours
out
to
a
dark
amber
in
the
glass
with
a
very
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
malt
and
smells
fresh
the
taste
is
very
good
there
is
a
wonderful
sweet
malt
taste
here
that
is
very
lightly
balanced
by
the
hops
its
tastes
lightly
sweet
and
is
very
refreshing
a
fine
example
of
the
amberred
style
after
all
is
said
and
done
this
beer
is
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
i
think
it
would
improve
if
it
were
slightly
fuller
in
body
and
more
complex
in
flavor
smooth
but
like
all
of
the
style
fall
short
of
greatness
this
beer
had
a
nice
amber
color
and
a
nice
malty
smell
however
it
is
boring
if
memory
serves
the
style
is
a
tad
boring
but
im
not
going
to
hold
it
against
the
beer
not
too
much
going
on
with
the
taste
a
malt
profile
with
a
nice
taste
but
not
too
complex
but
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
remember
saint
patrick
with
a
fine
session
brew
23oz
pour
from
tap
in
a
large
fluted
pilsner
glass
nice
head
on
top
of
a
deep
reddishbrown
liquid
pleasant
mouthful
of
malt
with
an
appropriate
amount
of
hops
to
balance
smell
somewhat
guessed
as
in
a
barsmoking
atmosphere
and
my
nose
isnt
the
best
under
optimal
conditions
definitely
worth
the
trouble
to
try
this
beer
great
sessionability
this
is
a
lively
brew
with
a
noticeable
scotchlike
alcohol
interesting
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
pour
was
a
clear
amber
aroma
was
rather
clean
taste
was
more
of
the
oktoberfest
variety
rather
malty
i
detected
some
husky
notes
as
well
pleasant
but
overall
not
earthshattering
could
make
a
nice
session
beer
for
a
change
harpoon
hibernian
style
ale
was
a
dark
copperruby
color
with
a
moderate
head
it
had
a
nice
fragrant
hop
aroma
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
caramelly
with
traces
of
coffee
and
citrusy
orangey
the
finish
was
dry
and
citrusy
overall
it
had
a
nice
smooth
blend
with
good
carbonation
and
a
good
hop
bite
id
have
another
notes
pretty
good
beer
to
drink
four
or
five
of
very
drinkable
a
bit
decieving
on
the
body
side
considering
how
sweet
the
aroma
is
thin
watery
mouthfeel
little
carbonation
little
hops
but
nice
sweet
lipsmacking
maltiness
that
goes
down
easy
very
drinkable
and
nonoffensive
to
just
about
any
beer
drinker
well
harpoon
has
consistently
underwhelmed
me
with
almost
all
of
their
beers
and
i
have
to
say
this
is
no
exception
first
of
all
i
know
this
site
has
had
some
reconfiguring
of
the
beer
styles
but
theres
no
way
this
is
a
pale
alebitter
its
an
irish
red
ale
and
there
is
no
mistaking
it
its
also
a
pretty
mediocre
one
which
is
tough
going
because
i
have
always
found
irish
reds
to
be
a
pretty
mediocre
style
in
general
while
not
as
initially
repugnant
as
harpoons
esb
this
is
still
pretty
unlikable
malts
have
a
nice
base
to
them
and
a
twinge
of
smokiness
is
brought
out
by
the
hops
but
there
is
a
huge
soap
flavor
that
harpoons
other
beers
have
it
wrecks
the
beer
and
since
irish
reds
are
usually
delicate
and
mild
the
off
flavor
is
overpowering
no
more
harpoon
for
me
please
ive
heard
they
are
currently
kicking
it
up
a
notch
and
making
more
interesting
beers
not
that
it
means
they
will
be
better
but
i
probably
wont
try
them
unless
the
word
is
that
theyre
truly
kick
ass
and
theyre
free
not
much
aroma
just
an
indefinite
sweetness
taste
was
a
little
better
mostly
malty
sweetness
and
just
a
wee
bit
of
hops
trying
valiantly
to
hold
back
the
malt
thin
but
not
too
thin
mouthfeel
the
hops
make
themselves
known
more
in
the
finish
but
not
overtly
so
pretty
drinkable
i
didnt
have
to
force
myself
a
good
alternative
to
macros
and
would
probably
be
good
for
educating
macro
drinkers
to
better
beer
flavor
is
not
very
strong
and
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
it
is
still
pretty
enjoyable
a
lot
of
sweet
fruitiness
with
a
mass
of
grains
start
you
out
it
then
gives
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
flavor
but
nothing
to
die
for
i
was
not
impressed
but
i
would
probably
drink
it
again
depending
on
my
other
options
even
with
the
odd
flavor
this
isnt
horrible
but
i
wont
spend
money
on
it
again
perish
the
thought
of
celebrating
st
paddys
day
with
it
as
the
bottle
suggests
decent
pour
that
yielded
a
choppy
and
soapy
looking
white
head
trails
of
lace
left
as
head
settled
the
color
is
darkish
red
the
mouthfeel
was
very
crisp
and
clean
a
light
refreshing
and
somewhat
watery
texture
a
malty
and
biscuitlike
taste
an
average
aroma
of
biscuit
and
malt
more
hops
and
malt
would
help
this
ale
alot
has
almost
a
mass
produced
beer
taste
its
ok
but
not
worh
buying
again
try
again
harpoon
says
on
label
its
an
irish
red
but
mine
seemed
to
be
more
copperbut
anyways
left
hardly
no
head
when
poured
a
little
bit
of
clove
or
cinnamon
in
the
smell
also
picked
up
some
woodlikw
smell
to
me
the
taste
had
some
smokiness
to
itit
was
very
malty
sweet
as
well
wich
i
liked
nice
mouthfeel
cant
drink
to
many
of
this
style
though
kinda
sits
in
my
stomach
a
pretty
good
american
style
irish
ale
though
the
initial
color
is
that
of
killians
a
redcopper
color
the
taste
is
total
malt
with
an
overabundance
of
caramel
sweetness
the
first
time
i
tried
this
i
loved
it
the
second
time
i
had
a
hard
time
finishing
it
it
is
rather
bland
and
it
seems
like
something
is
not
quite
right
in
the
balance
head
vanishes
quickly
and
you
are
left
with
a
glass
of
malty
syrup
it
seemed
it
has
quite
a
stong
aroma
a
hint
of
cinnamon
to
start
and
strong
alcohol
overall
very
inviting
colour
is
a
reddish
brown
and
quite
rich
to
taste
it
is
very
sweet
strong
malt
profile
and
a
nice
hop
bite
to
balance
there
is
an
unfortunate
watery
finish
and
aftertaste
which
detracts
body
is
quite
thin
too

i
find
to
be
a

on

something
i
would

i
will

looked
better
than
it
tasted

good
but
not
great
beer
pours
a
nice
coppery

head
the
aroma
just
isnt
there
but
has
a
pleasant
taste
and
is
easy

drink
reminded
me
of
killians
but
a
step
above
cheers
and
if
were
going
to
compare
harpoon
spring

ill
vote
for
the
long
gone
stout
over
this
the
maibock
and
anything
else
they
have
had

amber
color
with
a
rich
tan

when
poured
from
the
tap
a
pleasant
blend
of
malty
and
hoppy
aromas
and
more
of
the
same
in
the
flavor
an
enjoyable
above
average
amberred
ale
judge
the
beer
for
what
it
is
a
very
drinkable
irish
ale
rather
than
what
its
not
spring
maibock
lets
face
it
its
not
the
most
complex
style
out
there
but
this
beer
is
head
and
shoulders
above
the
other
massproduced
killians
etc
out
there
very
clean
and
drinkable
good
at
a
party
when
you
dont
want
to
have
to
think
about
the
beer
too
much
notes
harpoon
replaced
their
spring
maibock
with
this
beer
i
put
that
aside
they
come
out
with
an
irishstyle
red
ale
saranac
red
ale
is
unbearable
at
least
on
my
palate
its
bitter
and
tastes
like
the
inside
of
a
cologne
bottle
this
is
seemingly
what
some
beer
advocates
like
the
more
bitter
and
unbearable
the
tastier
it
is
i
dont
get
it
maybe
its
like
cheese
the
stinkier
and
more
bitter
the
higher
the
review
scores
that
said
if
you
are
a
regular
beer
drinker
like
i
am
i
drink
all
different
kinds
of
beers
then
you
most
likely
will
cringe
at
the
taste
of
the
red
ale
its
not
a
beer
to
drink
in
your
adirondack
chair
its
a
beer
to
drink
when
youre
already
wasted
from
a
few
landshark
lagers
this
beer
is
a
go
to
for
me
for
the
fall
i
dont
know
why
saranac
doesnt
make
this
a
stand
alone
seasonal
the
flavor
is
full
and
smooth
it
had
a
very
clean
finish
which
is
to
be
expected
from
saranac
one
of
my
favorites
very
malty
hops
dont
really
come
through
which
is
fine
overall
one
of
the
best
irish
reds
out
there
overall
a
mild
flavored
beer
where
several
can
be
easily
consumed
in
a
session
pours
a
copper
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
nose
is
lightly
bready
there
is
some
notes
of
caramel
malt
present
in
the
flavor
profile
but
the
taste
is
not
very
bold
there
is
a
pleasant
hoppy
finish
this
is
a
wellbalanced
red
that
is
sessionable
but
not
terribly
memorable
overall
a
fine
beer
but
it
misses
the
mark
compared
to
other
saranac
brews
copper
amber
color
with
decent
head
and
moderate
carbonation
hoppy
sweet
caramel
aroma
malty
flavor
flavors
are
very
well
integrated
and
balanced
slight
spice
flavor
and
the
floral
hop
flavor
also
comes
through
finishes
a
bit
drier
than
it
starts
could
be
a
bit
sweeter
a
solid
red
ale
that
is
worth
a
session
for
a
get
together
would
please
craft
brew
novices
but
may
lack
the
depth
that
some
craft
beer
nerds
myself
included
look
for
pretty
good
brew
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
clear
light
copperauburn
coloring
with
a
filmy
coating
of
offwhite
head
clinging
to
the
surface
aromas
of
roasty
caramel
and
toffee
malts
that
are
rich
but
balanced
flavors
are
smokey
and
roasted
initially
with
a
sweet
rich
caramel
backbone
that
is
both
tangy
and
slightly
bitter
sweet
buttery
and
caramel
tangy
aftertaste
that
leads
to
a
slick
sweet
and
slightly
cloying
finish
not
bad
for
the
style
but
overly
sweet
for
my
tastes
a
bit
more
balance
would
make
this
one
a
great
goto
for
an
irish
red
o
decent
beer
suffers
a
bit
from
too
much
sweetness
i
cant
think
of
anything
nice
to
say
about
this
other
than
it
is
one
of
the
many
beers
i
would
grudgingly
prefer
over
abitas
jockamo
suckfest
taste
is
really
creamy
sweet
caramel
malts
its
smooth
and
easy
drinker
nice
session
brew
and
really
not
a
bad
irish
red
there
isnt
much
wow
factor
but
its
solid
and
drinkable
sometimes
thats
all
you
need
not
bad
but
not
recommended
aroma
was
pretty
good
would
have
liked
a
little
more
ummpgh
in
the
flavor
department
nothing
bad
but
nothing
too
exciting
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
o
not
a
bad
irish
red
very
easy
drinking
and
clean
nice
sweet
flavors
with
a
bit
of
earhtiness
to
the
beer
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
an
average
representation
of
the
style
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
9
oz
glass
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
light
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
a
small
bit
of
floral
hops
tastes
of
roasted
malt
but
does
not
have
the
hop
tone
that
the
smell
gave
off
as
is
expected
in
this
type
of
beer
this
beer
has
a
great
finish
but
seems
to
have
a
little
bit
too
much
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
a
pleasant
surprise
easy
to
recommend
particularly
as
a
rather
inexpensive
brew
not
bad
esp
for
game
day
not
my
favorite
of
what
ales
you
mixed
twelve
pack
but
a
decent
if
kinda
boring
and
not
all
that
tasty
red
ale
price
point
is
the
only
notable
feature
of
this
one
o
tastes
nice
enough
i
would
be
happy
to
see
this
in
a
six
pack
as
i
dont
really
love
a
few
of
the
other
offerings
in
the
what
ales
you
mix
pack
an
average
ale
from
a
below
average
style
lightly
sweet
but
more
dry
and
oddly
bitter
moderate
one
finger
plus
head
of
light
tan
coloration
evaporates
too
quickly
to
really
dimple
mostly
smaller
bubbles
the
lacing
appears
a
thin
sheet
which
drifts
quickly
down
the
side
of
the
glass
copperish
color
to
the
liquid
very
clear
with
a
horde
of
loose
bubbles
rising
inside
more
bright
orange
around
the
rims
pralines
candied
nuts
brown
sugar
molasses
kind
of
grapey
with
date
fig
banana
aspects
does
have
a
bit
more
grains
and
hoppiness
than
expected
gives
it
better
posture
in
the
nostrils
lightbodied
would
likely
feel
flat
were
it
not
for
the
quite
aggressive
carbonation
which
keeps
it
sloshing
around
the
mouth
here
you
get
a
light
metallic
aspect
along
with
quinine
and
more
indistinct
herbaceousness
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
would
suggest
however
you
do
get
caramel
cane
sugar
molasses
bubblegum
notes
along
with
challah
bread
the
fig
apple
pear
fruit
basic
enough
supplemented
by
some
orange
peel
the
nuttiness
helps
flesh
out
the
finish
all
in
all
not
bad
for
what
it
is
but
not
something
id
seek
out
per
se
o
a
drinkable
irish
red
ale
but
could
really
use
a
bigger
body
to
give
it
more
depth
nothing
special
and
would
only
drink
again
if
not
much
else
overall
a
fine
beer
by
saranac
i
havent
had
many
of
this
style
so
im
not
to
fond
of
the
dry
finish
but
the
flavors
are
pleasant
and
its
quite
sessionable
overall
this
is
quite
a
nice
brew
very
flavorful
and
drinkable
pours
a
clear
deep
copper
lots
of
slow
carbonation
offwhite
film
smell
is
equal
parts
mineral
toasted
malts
taste
starts
off
bitter
morphing
into
semisweet
crystal
malts
and
finishing
sort
of
nuttty
and
tannic
feel
is
flat
smooth
decent
ive
only
been
able
to
find
one
6
pack
of
this
beer
and
it
was
well
worth
it
one
of
the
best
irish
red
ales
ive
had
that
didnt
break
your
wallet
but
now
i
cant
seem
to
find
it
anywhere
compared
to
sam
adams
or
oharas
it
is
hard
to
beat
based
on
price
and
taste
another
quality
beer
from
saranac
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
kinda
amber
colored
and
poured
a
decent
off
white
head
the
beer
had
a
nice
toffee
smell
that
was
also
in
the
taste
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
does
not
knock
your
socks
off
but
is
a
good
all
around
beer
i
will
buy
again
not
bad
overall
well
rounded
and
smooth
not
a
bad
take
on
the
style
this
was
an
ok
beer
i
have
yet
to
find
an
irish
red
that
is
real
impressive
i
guess
this
was
on
par
with
typical
saranac
offerings
very
drinkable
and
nothing
too
extreme
pours
a
clear
copper
red
with
deep
white
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
no
lacing
of
the
glass
no
aroma
to
speak
of
taste
is
excellent
caramel
malt
with
the
lightest
touch
of
hops
to
balance
one
of
this
brewerys
better
offerings
from
the
12
beers
a
fallin
variety
pack
poured
into
my
geordie
schooner
definitely
a
red
brew
with
a
medium
head
malt
dominates
the
aroma
quite
pleasantly
this
reminds
me
of
a
killians
only
better
this
was
easy
drinking
and
quite
mild
not
super
complex
actually
no
complexity
a
sold
basic
red
overall
i
enjoyed
it
out
of
the
12
beers
a
fallen
pack
during
a
football
game
o
eh
ive
had
better
and
probably
wont
go
searching
this
one
out
again
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
looking
red
color
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
on
top
that
fizzled
away
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
malty
had
some
light
grainy
aromas
and
some
hops
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
a
pretty
good
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
drinkable
and
went
down
pretty
easily
overall
this
brew
wasnt
too
bad
i
wouldnt
say
id
buy
a
case
but
if
it
was
offered
to
me
id
drink
it
again
for
sure
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
nothing
worth
seeking
out
it
came
as
part
of
the
fall
variety
pack
a
little
more
hoppiness
and
it
would
have
some
legs
my
pour
left
me
with
two
dense
fingers
of
tawny
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
copperyred
with
nequality
clarity
that
makes
me
think
of
former
gfs
and
women
with
that
natural
hair
color
that
speaks
to
the
reptilianneanderthal
part
of
my
brain
goo
bup
nose
was
much
hoppier
than
i
anticipated
and
now
i
cannot
tell
you
whether
that
is
good
or
bad
i
like
hops
sure
but
necessarily
in
my
ipas
mouthfeel
was
full
and
creamy
and
i
got
hops
initially
on
the
tongue
but
quickly
followed
by
a
biscuit
maltiness
finish
was
more
malty
than
hoppy
so
it
all
worked
out
in
the
end
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
amberish
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
on
the
malty
side
taste
is
malty
a
touch
of
caramel
just
a
bit
of
hops
are
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
one
at
logan
liquors
today
simply
because
of
the
great
price
poured
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
generous
light
brown
head
aromas
of
caramel
toasted
malt
and
toffee
medium
bodied
and
sweet
with
toasted
malt
and
caramel
olike
most
everything
from
saranac
it
is
ehh
however
i
prefer
this
red
ale
to
sam
adams
with
a
choice
between
the
two
go
with
this
one
d
this
is
a
nice
balanced
ira
carameltoffee
without
too
much
sweetness
toasty
dryness
without
much
darkly
toast
flavors
nicely
to
style
and
appropriately
with
balancing
hops
appropriate
heft
and
strength
well
made
and
nicely
drinkable
o
this
is
a
pretty
nice
irishstyle
red
ale
it
would
make
a
nice
session
ale
this
was
a
nice
little
session
red
that
i
enjoyed
tremendously
nice
light
amber
pours
with
a
huge
head
of
white
that
came
up
a
full
three
fingers
in
height
smooth
settling
left
a
good
bit
of
side
glass
lace
and
a
nice
and
even
coating
across
the
top
of
the
glass
interesting
aroma
as
it
started
out
with
a
nice
and
well
rounded
bready
malt
that
seemed
to
slowly
evolve
into
a
grassy
herbal
hop
profile
with
a
bit
of
a
kick
from
the
caramel
did
not
seem
to
have
a
clear
direction
but
the
taste
made
up
for
it
nicely
very
smooth
nice
caramel
and
malty
tones
that
won
me
over
with
ease
smooth
even
flavor
crisp
clean
and
well
balanced
smooth
notes
of
grassy
bittering
hops
coming
in
at
the
finish
gave
it
a
nice
little
drying
effect
and
warmed
it
up
very
drinkable
as
it
went
down
smooth
and
left
me
looking
for
more
right
away
appearace

almost

nice
thick

and
more
sweet
caramel
and
sugar
flavors
take
center
stage
with
some
secondary
candied
apple
light
bodied
and
low
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
ale
overall
a
pretty
good
showing
in
a
generally
unremarkable
class
d
very
drinkable
very
smooth
but
also
fairly
simple
there
is
not
too
much
flavor
really
going
on
and
it
could
have
used
a
bit
more
here
or
there
still
a
refreshing
and
crisp
beer
though
o
overall
and
good
cheap
irish
red
ale
this
is
an
ok
beer
overall
the
low
abv
and
light
body
make
it
an
easy
drinker
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
very
low
on
the
carbonation
which
is
the
only
major
downside
to
this
brew
overall
a
decent
beer
to
find
on
tap
at
a
bar
amongst
the
macro
rubbish
d
very
drinkable
a
good
st
patricks
day
session
ale
d
this
was
a
completely
underwhelming
irish
red
didnt
particularly
care
for
it
and
not
a
good
representation
of
the
style
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
light
and
has
a
smooth
feel
going
down
that
was
a
bit
sweeter
then
expected
it
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
as
well
and
goes
down

certainly
much
better
irish

to
be
had
out
there
easy
to
drink
but
not
very
inviting
drinkability
is
very
high
much
like
the
other
saranacs
this
one
can
be
thrown
back
with
ease
time
and
time
again
while
this
one
isnt
stellar
and
could
use
more
depth
its
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
quite
drinkable
taste
hops
come
through
about
mid
palate
i
get
the
traditional
irish
red
taste
but
something
seems
off
balance
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
drinkability
is
about
average
the
hops
seem
a
little
off
from
12

brew
not
a

and
slight

there
isnt
much
more
to
say
other
than
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
smooth
it
does
not
numb
the
palate
nor
overpower
the
taste
buds
this
is
topshelf
stuff
for
a
cheap
4
5
beer
believe
it
and
i
would
happily
stuff
my
fridge
full
of
these
for
relaxing
days
if
i
wasnt
so
into
tasting
and
reviewing
all
kinds
of
other
beers
buy
this
beer
d
flavorful
and
smooth
easily
drinkable
even
though
the
crystal
malt
was
pretty
dominating
drinkability
this
would
go
well
as
an
easygoing
session
brew
or
with
some
bangers
and
mash
but
as
far
as
a
version
youll
admire
it
really
doesnt
strike
that
kind
of
chord
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
translucent
copper
with
a
loose
half
inch
tancolored
head
that
quickly
disperses
into
a
tight
bubbly
band
around
the
edges
no
lacing
on
this
one
nose
is
almost
nonexistent
but
suggests
a
light
malty
body
perhaps
caramel
malt
and
a
slightly
metallic
quality
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
a
slightly
skunky
quality
is
expressed
towards
the
middle
and
the
metallic
character
resurfaces
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
lively
assertive
almost
prickly
carbonation
and
some
astringency
its
definitely
drinkable
but
really
not
all
that
impressive
a
swing
and
a
miss
no
need
to
try
this
one
again
this
is
a
typical
red
through
and
through
it
poured
deep
red
in
color
is
has
a
very
nice
color
but
absolutely
no
head
remains
after
a
few
seconds
much
like
a
soda
the
aroma
is
of
malt
and
grains
but
nothing
distinctive
the
tastes
begins
sweets
and
as
the
carbonation
builds
it
drys
and
leaves
a
grain
taste
on
the
tongue
for
the
price
its
drink
increases
but
overall
doesnt
stand
out
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
some
caramel
toffee
malt
a
prickly
mouthfeel
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
a
good
all
around
beer
yet
not
extraordinary
i
would
drink
it
again
not
much
to
this
beer
even
though
i
have
not
had
much
in
the
style
and
yes
i
do
have
irish
in
me
but
ill
pass
on
this
from
now
on
d
i
could
put
a
sixxer
of
this
away
without
a
problem
at
a
party
not
an
extrodinary
beer
but
an
average
red
ale
that
i
wouldnt
look
past
at
the
store
pretty
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
irish
red
ale
but
i
would
definitely
consider
getting
it
again
it
came
in
te
fall
seasonal
variety
pack
for
saranac
its
a
pretty
well
made
fall
beer
good
sipper
not
much
to
dislike
about
it
would
be
easy
to
session
but
not
quite
great
d
a
bit
on
the
tame
side
but
good
for
a
couple
d
good
drinkable
beer
and
sad
by
the
seasonal
status
all
in
all
this
wasnt
half
bad
i
see
this
best
as
a
beer
to
enjoy
along
with
a
meat
pie
burger
or
simple
grilled
chicken
sandwich
and
some
fries
drinkability
doesnt
taste
good
enough
to
warrant
many
more
side
note
i
went
to
see
umphreys
mcgee
this
summer
at
the
saranac
brewery
and
in
between
sets
they
were
giving
out
free
irish
red
saranac
irish
red
ale
fits
into
the
tmbc
lineup
pretty
much
where
i
though
it
would
for
those
upstate
new
yorkers
looking
to
drink
locally
and
save
a
few
bucks
have
at
it
for
anyone
looking
for
an
enjoyable
irish
red
keep
looking
smooth
and
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
good
for
a
st
pattys
day
celebration
this
beer
had
a
medium
creamy
tan
head
with
a
very
dark
red
body
the
smell
didnt
have
much
of
a
hop
aroma
i
was
picking
up
a
slight
yeast
smell
but
also
toffee
this
beer
is
lightly
carbonated
witch
fits
well
with
soft
undertone
of
carmel
and
toffee
i
believe
the
toffee
is
however
more
noticeable
the
beer
seems
like
a
light
irish
red
or
watery
to
me
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
bolder
this
irish
red
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
will
buy
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
basic
irish
red
nothing
really
stands
out
from
this
beer
but
for
3
99
a
six
pack
i
might
find
myself
drinking
it
again
since
it
has
some
flavor
to
it
clear
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
leaves
some
fine
lace
on
the
glass
caramel
and
roasty
malty
aroma
with
a
touch
of
floral
hop
sweet
and
malty
upfront
with
some
minty
hop
bittering
in
the
finish
medium
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
imo
it
wont
blow
your
mind
but
would
any
irish
red
d
a
very
enjoyable
and
sessionable
irish
red
not
overly
sweet
which
serves
to
enhance
the
drinkability
a
nice
example
of
the
style
comments
overall
this
beer
presents
some
good
attributes
but
other
key
components
seem
to
be
missing
appearance
is
a
mediumdark
red
smell
is
slight
nuttiness
and
alcohol
i
taste
sweet
maltiness
with
some
sweet
cereal
with
a
dry
finish
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
it
is
really
thin
drinkability
is
good
not
the
most
delicious
beer
but
very
easy
drinking
notes
overall
its
not
bad
but
to
me
it
is
rather
simple
and
light
poured
to
a
redamber
color
from
my
vigorous
pour
i
received
a
thick
tall
head
which
dwindled
quickly
but
stuck
around
from
there
on
sweet
malt
on
the
nose
sweet
flavor
as
well
hints
of
sweet
caramel
develops
into
a
light
hoppy
bittterness
in
the
finish
this
was
an
average
beer
for
me
nothing
really
stood
out
for
me
it
wasnt
bland
just
a
sweet
beer
with
no
real
strong
flavor
probably
wont
get
this
one
again
pours
a
decent
midred
color
with
just
a
bit
of
initial
head
and
no
lacing
clean
malty
scent
but
thats
about
it
for
the
aroma
decent
clean
malty
flavor
as
well
but
without
much
of
anything
else
did
not
have
that
nice
extra
sourness
red
ales
from
ireland
have
goes
down
smooth
not
a
great
beer
but
a
drinkable
one
ill
not
buy
another
six
pack
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
d
not
a
bad
red
ale
there
were
a
lot
of
coarse
characteristics
carbonation
saturated
malt
that
blanketed
a
lot
of
potential
features
its
worth
a
try
though
d
this
was
one
of
my
first
stabs
at
saranac
and
dont
know
how
i
feel
about
it
it
is
a
step
above
bmc
but
not
by
much
will
try
others
from
the
brewery
but
dont
know
if
this
is
one
i
will
revisit
drinkability
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
and
quickly
and
went
nicely
with
a
simple
fish
meal
there
are
other
irish
reds
out
there
i
enjoy
more
though
still
if
it
was
available
id
take
it
one
of
my
favorite
style
love
the
malt
d
ok
at
least
its
light
has
some
flavor
to
it
not
one
id
get
again
however
d
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
at
all
and
imo
one
of
saranacs
best
made
beers
pours
an
bright
amber
with
nice
intricate
lacing
smells
of
toasty
malts
nothing
spectacular
but
fresh
fullbodied
mouthfeel
allows
the
tang
of
hops
to
accent
but
allow
the
malt
character
to
remain
stage
center
not
bad
at
all
much
better
than
killians
a
bit
dry
not
onedimensional
but
not
3
or
4
either
good
for
quaffing
something
that
has
flavor
drinkability
this
is
a
great
low
abv
session
beer
perfect
for
st
patties
day
and
will
make
an
appearance
in
place
of
killians
any
day
of
the
week
great
effort
and
sessionability
pours
a
copper
amber
red
color
with
a
strong
and
sticky
foamy
off
white
head
caramel
malt
sweetness
a
strange
piney
wintergreen
note
and
a
strong
musty
bready
yeast
aroma
simple
and
pretty
well
balanced
no
detectable
flaws
crisp
and
highly
carbonated
very
easy
to
drink
had
2
yesterday
with
a
spicy
chicken
breast
sandwich
dead
on
strong
effort
here
from
saranac
pours
a
nice
amber
red
sweet
caramel
smell
tastes
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
maple
syrup
feels
mildly
smooth
in
your
mouth
its
a
good
beer
for
drinking
while
eating
food
the
mild
bitterness
contrasts
hearty
meals
very
well
not
much
foam
when
poured
which
is
nice
indeed
overall
a
good
beer
pours
a
clear
bright
burnt
umber
with
a
halffinger
of
ecru
head
that
diminishes
quickly
and
leaves
a
miniscule
amount
of
transitory
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
of
figs
dark
malts
molasses
brown
sugar
and
citrus
the
taste
emphasizes
the
sweet
malts
and
adds
a
bite
of
spice
and
a
healthy
but
not
overwhelming
dose
of
hoppy
pine
and
bitterness
the
body
is
a
solid
moderate
and
runs
smoothly
over
the
tongue
but
the
high
carbonation
detracts
slightly
overall
a
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
indeed
overall
this
is
a
bland
thin
irish
red
that
i
would
not
return
to
easy
enough
to
drink
sweet
touch
but
not
too
sweet
a
thin
mild
interpretation
of
the
style
a
very
good
example
of
an
irish
red
ale
cheers
saranac
irish
red
is
a
fairly
drinkability
enjoyable
beer
a
lot
of
beers
around
here
have
saranac
or
macros
to
choose
from
so
i
will
always
be
happy
to
see
this
irish
red

tap
drinkability
a
veritably
drinkable
beer
on

upper
echelon

being
mediocre
defiantly
worth
a
try
goes
down
easy
nothing
off
very
drinkable
just
not
overly
exciting
i
decided
to
try
this
ale
after
hearing
some
good
things
about
it
i
am
quite
impressed
with
it
overall
it
certainly
isnt
earth
shattering
but
is
a
very
enjoyable
drink
it
produces
an
off
white
head
that
unfortunately
dissipates
fairly
quickly
and
leaves
only
a
small
amount
of
lacing
the
color
is
an
inviting
and
rich
amberred
it
smells
very
pleasant
ans
mildly
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is

is
