poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
wheat
oranges
taste
is
crisp
wheat
spice
a
bit
of
orange
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
thirst
quenching
and
enjoyable
beer
due
to
the
wheat
coriander
and
orange
peel
i
was
expecting
a
wit
influence
doesnt
looks
smell
or
taste
like
a
wit
at
all
its
pure
american
style
wheat
which
is
just
dandy
after
a
6
mile
train
run
overall
i
am
disappointed
with
this
one
everything
about
it
is
light
and
a
bit
boring
overall
good
brew
i
would
have
this
one
again
this
beer
was
vey
unique
to
me
had
a
flavor
but
more
bitterness
than
the
flavor
wasnt
bad
at
all
tho
i
went
to
a
local
brew
store
in
my
home
town
where
they
said
its
a
big
favorite
so
ihad
to
give
it
a
try
and
was
honestly
impressed
taste
a
little
like
a
light
beer
i
guess
you
could
say
very
hard
to
really
explain
cause
it
was
so
different
to
me
go
try
it
i
imagine
this
is
fairly
popular
would
work
when
it
is
hot
humid
but
only
for
two
at
the
most
for
me
there
are
way
better
wheat
beers
out
there
one
done
atmosphere
is
okay
no
head
and
no
lacing
nose
is
light
and
bready
light
grainy
flavor
accentuated
with
a
little
hint
of
sweet
overall
this
is
an
okay
quaff
thanks
to
brad
for
sending
this
out
my
way
tick
the
beer
is
golden
hued
with
a
thin
fleeting
white
head
the
aroma
offers
sweet
malt
grain
ripe
fruit
sweet
and
cloying
with
fairly
low
carbonation
not
something
i
would
try
more
than
once
lacking
wheat
and
hop
character
bland
no
fun
o
this
is
one
of
the
worst
wheat
beers
ive
ever
had
at
least
canebreak
has
some
flavor
even
if
its
not
that
good
this
beer
pours
up
a
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
small
head
no
retention
and
no
lacing
smell
is
citrus
not
bad
and
maybe
the
strongest
feature
of
this
offering
taste
is
very
weak
with
notes
of
tangy
orange
and
spicy
coriander
a
little
aspiriny
taste
is
there
too
mouthfeel
is
thin
this
one
is
okay
but
nowhere
near
being
my
favorite
but
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
the
shocktop
equivalent
this
beer
is
like
most
deep
southern
beers
a
slightly
simplified
version
of
the
style
i
like
the
yeast
and
wheat
melange
with
a
touch
of
citrus
at
first
but
eventually
it
bores
me
i
do
imagine
it
would
be
refreshing
in
warmer
weather
the
texture
is
okay
at
first
but
finishes
dry
and
a
touch
chalky
a
little
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
isnt
too
encouraging
either
not
worth
driving
eleven
hours
for
drink
it
was
semi
tasty
a
little
heavy
handed
at
times
but
then
with
90
degree
heat
was
fine
rjt
overall
unfortunately
its
one
of
those
beers
thats
instantly
forgettawait
what
were
we
talking
about
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
tall
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
looks
super
carbonated
there
are
aromas
of
bready
malt
orange
and
spices
the
flavor
is
bready
from
the
barley
and
wheat
malts
there
are
mild
contributions
from
the
orange
peel
and
the
coriander
the
hop
presence
is
there
but
not
strong
the
body
is
light
with
plentiful
carbonation
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
its
the
sort
of
beer
that
would
be
very
drinkable
after
being
outside
on
a
summer
day
this
is
a
good
beer
if
only
a
bit
standard
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
pretty
bubbly
golden
yellow
head
is
thin
but
this
is
apparently
an
artifact
of
the
pour
rich
aroma
is
wheaty
with
firm
tones
of
apple
lemon
and
banana
satisfying
flavor
has
a
wheaty
core
and
fruity
notes
plus
a
hint
of
butterscotch
and
a
touch
of
hops
lively
texture
has
average
body
but
plenty
of
tingle
and
sass
a
truly
satisfying
summer
brew
certain
to
cool
you
off
on
a
hot
day
and
its
hot
as
allgetout
in
atlanta
right
now
in
may
taste
is
just
above
average
with
a
slight
wheaty
orange
lager
flavor
nothing
crazy
here
but
crisp
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
several
of
these
with
no
trouble
while
not
amazing
this
is
a
decent
session

aroma
is
nice
otherwise
pretty
average
oimo
its
descent
and
very
drinkable
but
not
impressive
in
the
least
glad
my
friend
picked
some
up
for
me
to
try
thanks
julie
this
beer
has
a
medium
amber
color
and
is
very
transparent
the
head
is
small
and
disappears
quickly
the
beer
smells
bready
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
very
subtle
hops
and
spice
at
the
end
its
light
bodied
and
refreshing
overall
the
beer
is
light
sweet
and
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
but
this
is
a
decent
lighter
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
overall
this
is
a
throw
back
lawn
mower
beer
this
would
also
work
well
for
macro
loving
friends
overall
a
clean
if
somewhat
bland
american
wheat
could
use
some
more
spices
and
more
protein
to
help
hold
some
head
this
claims
to
be
a
summer
wheat
so
i
was
expecting
a
weizen
style
and
i
expected
some
added
spice
as
well
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
this
is
that
it
is
inoffensive
its
sweetness
is
balanced
by
a
slightly
metallic
zing
the
orange
flavor
doesnt
show
as
an
orangepeel
or
essencemaybe
it
is
folded
into
the
sweetness
it
has
almost
no
wheat
characteristics
it
really
looks
like
a
lager
in
the
glass
only
faintly
rusty
no
conventional
native
wheat
spiciness
or
fruitiness
and
the
added
spice
is
nondescript
this
beer
reminds
me
of
shiner
bockit
shares
that
beers
somewhat
papery
overtone
it
suggests
a
beer
like
shiner
also
in
that
it
comes
from
a
nominally
quirky
brewery
that
is
obviously
trying
not
to
startle
people
used
to
mainstream
beers
these
guys
need
to
take
the
governor
off
their
system
and
really
make
a
weizenstyle
with
corriander
and
orange
it
sounds
good
overall
this
is
good
for
the
style
but
the
only
lazy
magnolia
beer
that
did
not
blow
me
away
this
one
is
not
a
bad
beer
especially
on
a
hot
day
however
it
is
the
only
lm
i
will
not
seek
out
again
m
a
bit
crisp
and
a
little
astringent
medium
carbonation
o
average
kinda
beer
can
see
why
i
would
drink
this
without
end
on
a
hot
and
humid
southern
day
great
for
sessioning
but
loses
points
for
originality
fairly
simple
drefreshing
would
drink
again
2
or
3
probably
preferable
dont
know
why
theyre
adding
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
if
its
with
such
a
light
hand
kinda
like
an
upmarket
blue
moon
which
is
not
a
compliment
too
stick
to
be
the
summer
drinker
they
want
it
to
be
dwould
be
nice
on
a
summer
day
this
would
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
could
think
of
on
a
hot
day
even
though
it
isnt
a
hot
day
and
im
inside
i
still
enjoy
this
immensely
probably
one
of
the
best
sessionable
beers
around
cheers
drinkability
fairly
decent
brew
might
be
fun
to
experiment
with
adding
lemon
or
lime
but
certainly
best
to
first
taste
this
one
alone
to
get
the
full
experience
of
the
true
beer
i
wonder
if
this
is
misclassified
not
much
wheat
going
on
not
much
of
anything
going
on
for
that
matter
poured
a
slightly
amber
light
brown
none
of
the
spices
made
much
of
an
impression
nondescript
light
malt
flavor
was
the
most
noteworthy
aspect
d
goes
down
really
quickly
and
easily
i
could
easily
have
a
large
quantity
of
this
definitely
for
those
warm
weather
days
d
decent
beer
for
a
summertime
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
but
its
really
nothing
to
special
butterscotch
in
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
carries
some
herbs
cilantro
parsley
sage
but
im
not
picking
up
any
spice
the
smell
is
of
a
saison
that
was
brewed
with
a
poor
choice
of
spices
and
the
taste
is
even
worse
this
beer
is
vegetal
and
it
shouldnt
be
if
it
were
done
correctly
if
someone
had
asked
me
what
this
beer
had
been
brewed
with
i
would
have
been
tempted
to
answer
celery
any
sweetness
or
bitterness
from
any
traditional
ingredients
is
loss
in
the
effort
to
block
the
vegetal
taste
from
your
tongue
but
its
not
easy
still
there
is
a
mild
sweetness
from
the
light
malts
but
no
bitterness
from
the
hops
i
rarely
pour
a
beer
but
this
one
had
to
go
and
i
also
left
behind
5
bottles
form
the
sixpack
for
the
next
person
to
get
the
hotel
room
i
hope
they
have
the
good
sense
to
pour
it
too
edit
had
this
beer
on
tap
a
couple
weeks
ago
and
was
not
impressed
i
dont
know
what
the
deal
was
but
it
was
very
lackluster
im
not
going
to
edit
the
numbers
but
just
leave
a
note
in
here
could
have
been
the
keg
the
glassware
or
inconsistency
in
brewing
without
knowing
more
i
cant
take
this
beer
down
a
peg
or
two
based
on
one
bad
experience
after
having
a
better
than
average
review
of
it
before
if
it
happens
again
ill
play
with
the
numbers
and
make
note
of
it
otherwise
ill
leave
it
where
it
sits
great
drinkable
beer
im
surprised
at
the
low
ratings
its
a
summer
beer
folks
drinkability
isnt
good
though
i
imagine
the
big
spiced
character
could
potentially
et
out
of
hand
certainly
not
bad
though
d
pretty
drinkable
the
label
compliments
itself
on
its
superb
drinkable
in
southeastern
summers
but
having
reviewed
this
beer
outside
in
alabama
in
july
i
can
say
with
authority
this
claim
is
overrated
drinkable
sure
sublimely
so
nope
overall
just
interesting
i
guess
not
something
i
would
go
after
again
i
dont
think
but
a
pleasant
experience
overall
i
would
say
like
i
said
im
just
not
an
ale
guy
even
during
the
summer
months
poured
a
decently
clear
slight
haze
tangerine
with
little
specks
of
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
short
lived
1
5
white
head
that
left
a
scant
ring
a
small
patch
of
lacing
looks
somewhat
disappointing
and
yes
it
is
quite
so
aroma
of
metallic
orange
sherbet
with
a
tangy
wheat
touch
and
tastes
exactly
as
it
smells
as
well
this
is
lacking
in
orange
and
has
a
weird
metallic
off
flavor
that
is
definitely
getting
in
the
way
of
my
enjoyment
slight
caramel
in
the
finish
bubbly
and
lots
of
carbonation
im
not
a
fan
hope
i
can
finish
this
tastes
like
a
witbier
without
the
soft
and
mildly
fruity
wit
yeast
profile
strong
spicing
and
plenty
of
wheat
flavors
some
pithy
orange
peel
flavors
dont
quite
meld
with
the
coriander
was
hoping
for
something
a
bit
softer
still
fairly
enjoyable
though
crisp
and
refreshing
tart
even
not
bad
worth
a
go
in
the
summertime
d
easy
drinking
refreshing
beer
that
is
pretty
forgettable
d
very
drinkable
a
solid
little
wheat
ale
glad
lazy
mag
has
started
bottling
more
than
just
the
southern
pecan
light
bodied
with
somewhat
tingly
carbonation
not
a
bad
summer
beer
not
great

inyourface
herbspice
signature
and
tasty
refreshing
wheat
base
that
has
broad
appeal
drinkability
is
not
great
find
this
brew
kind
of
dull
and
boring
tastes
just
like
your
average
wheat
beer
with
the
orange
and
coriander
on
top
pretty
light
and
refreshing
after
a
day
of
painting
but
a
little
too
sweet
and
flowery
for
me
it
would
be
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
were
it
not
for
the
grainy
metallic
finish
which
i
did
not
care
for
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
again
d
the
harshness
of
the
carbonation
is
the
only
real
inhibitor
here
this
might
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
down
in
the
delta
but
i
cant
see
any
other
reason
to
revisit
this
one
the
indian
summer
wheat
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
color
with
a
minimal
white
frothy
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
not
much
retention
on
the
glass
also
no
haze
to
the
color
smells
of
musky
grains
and
some
citrus
fruits
not
overpowering
but
pretty
pleasant
taste
has
much
more
citrus
fruits
than
the
nose
lots
of
grapefruit
with
some
bitterness
to
the
finish
some
spiciness
as
well
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
fairly
thin
drinkability
is
solid
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
not
overpowering
but
a
nice
flavor
profile
simple
and
and
enjoyable
wow
botmc
selection
from
brett
favres
hometown
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
a
nice
spicy
nutmeg
and
coriander
with
some
citrus
notes
particularly
orange
and
banana
pours
to
a
pale
yellow
orange
with
a
foamy
multisized
bubble
head
taste
is
very
summerlike
nice
spicing
hint
of
coriander
banana
and
orange
zest
good
mouthfeel
not
over
carbonated
tastes
perfect
on
this
88
degree
day
taste
is
consistant
throughout
i
like
the
finish
as
it
gets
real
zesty
and
tangy
leaving
a
hankering
for
the
next
sip
for
what
this
is
its
spot
on
a
great
summer
beer
overall
a
very
bland
lifeless
beer
not
something
i
would
ever
pick
up
on
my
own
drinkability
a
drinkable
brew
due
to
its
low
alcohol
content
light
mouthfeel
and
nonoverpowering
flavors
however
since
i
found
this
to
be
kind
of
lifeless
i
will
not
seek
out
again
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
it
was
a
little
more
bitter
than
i
would
have
liked
and
lacked
a
punch
of
flavor
that
i
expected
this
beer
takes
me
back
to
when
i
used
to
drink
hoegaarden
and
blue
moon
like
it
was
my
job
those
beers
were
ultimately
my
gateway
to
better
beer
and
indian
summer
would
have
been
a
staple
for
me
a
decade
ago
had
i
been
able
to
get
my
hands
on
some
witbiers
are
no
longer
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
whatever
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
i
actually
wish
i
had
another
bottle
or
two
so
some
of
my
noncraft
drinking
friends
could
give
it
a
whirl
this
was
a
nice
beer
sent
as
a
extra
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
it
pours
a
light
haze
yellow
some
bananna
sugar
it
is
a
light
beer
at
heart
and
has
a
nice
taste
but
does
not
really
break
any
new
boundries
or
even
hold
its
own
this
would
only
be
a
go
to
if
this
was
all
i
had
to
choose
this
is
a
beer
that
you
could
pound
down
all
night
long
unfortunately
thats
not
what
i
really
look
for
in
a
beer
it
usually
means
that
there
just
isnt
alot
going
on
with
the
beer
flavorwise
i
can
think
of
a
few
other
beers
that
id
reach
for
first
the
next
time
that
i
want
a
wheat
beer
d
all
in
all
pretty
good
brew
gonna
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
weekend
i
dont
care
for
this
style
but
lazy
magnolia
has
produced
a
wheat
ale
that
is
as
good
as
most
this
would
be
enjoyable
on
a
warm
summer
day
drinkability
no
weight
to
it
and
it
tastes
like
water
with
an
orange
slice
so
while
you
could
drink
a
ton
of
it
but
theres
really
no
flavor
or
substance
to
it
so
why
would
you
nice
pale
copper
sort
of
color
not
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
bready
and
caramel
like
aromas
nice
solid
malt
flavor
upfront
soft
bitterness
in
the
backround
lingering
sweetness
very
solid
body
for
the
lower
abv
a
nice
beera
lot
of
flavor
and
body
i
could
see
doing
a
lot
of
this
in
any
season
medium
bodied
light
effervesce
on
tongue
tip
slightly
warming
in
throat
very
nice
will
look
for
more
from
them
comments
it
was
not
what
i
expected
i
anticipated
something
more
like
a
belgian
wit
or
a
german
hefe
but
it
was
neither
none
of
the
cloudy
flavorful
yeasts
to
be
had
in
those
styles
however
i
dont
think
this
was
supposed
to
be
one
of
those
but
rather
its
own
thing
taste
is
a
nice
combination
of
wheaty
and
spicy
like
a
combo
of
an
american
wheat
with
a
belgian
its
quite
drinkable
and
quite
well
done
its
light
and
crisp
but
that
doesnt
nearly
make
up
for
the
taste
oh
well
lazy
magnolia
makes
better
stuff
so
when
i
visit
family
in
louisiana
at
least
ill
have
better
options
d
id
drink
this
on
the
regular
if
i
had
to
as
it
is
a
good
baseline
craft
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
though
pours
golden
orange
with
a
minimal
white
head
not
much
aroma
but
what
is
there
is
wheat
and
some
unidentifiable
fruit
the
flavor
is
more
pronounced
with
wheat
yeast
and
a
citrus
fruit
possibly
apricot
or
orange
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nothing
special
but
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
one
is
meant
for
a
hot
day
as
it
probably
is
in
mississippi
during
the
indian
summer
days
down
there
i
felt
like
this
beer
would
be
more
suited
to
drinking
in
september
up
here
in
new
england
d
this
is
very
nostalgic
of
my
childhood
when
i
would
get
sick
and
have
to
drink
that
orange
flavored
medicine
not
the
fondest
memories
considering
they
all
surround
me
being
sick
or
ill
sorry
but
this
one
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
light
up
front
with
a
heavier
medium
body
towards
the
end
of
the
palate
with
a
nice
amount
of
bready
yeast
light
sweet
citrus
fruit
subtle
malt
backbone
and
a
prominent
pepperyspicy
character
nice
biscuit
and
graham
crackery
malt
backbone
with
subtle
bread
flavor
along
with
sweet
citrus
orange
peel
and
a
strong
spicy
corriander
presence
the
corriander
flavor
is
the
most
prominent
but
there
is
also
a
good
amount
of
the
orange
peel
citrus
well
balanced
and
a
refreshing
session
beer
for
the
warmer
months
d
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
that
would
make
a
very
good
choice
for
a
patio
beer
in
good
barbque
weather
d
i
cant
get
over
this
incredibly
awkward
flavor
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
dont
like
it
its
really
not
bad
per
se
but
its
not
something
id
want
again
thanks
to
piginapen
for
this
one
it
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
bread
infused
with
coriander
the
flavor
profile
is
heavy
on
orange
and
coriander
slightly
sweet
and
zesty
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
a
decent
wheat
beer
that
kinda
works
for
me
this
is
an
easy
summer
drinker
and
a
good
offering
from
lazy
mag
thanks
to
joeyr
for
bringing
it
to
the
tasting
this
was
my
first
offering
from
this
brewery
while
i
probably
wouldnt
order
it
again
i
would
recommend
it
to
those
that
want
a
light
beer
that
is
not
an
american
adjunct
lager
d
great
summer
beer
d
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
especially
after
smelling
it
and
seeing
the
weak
head
but
this
is
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
the
spice
character
is
distinct
but
restrained
enough
that
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
a
nice
drinkable
summer
beer
md
light
and
crisp
medium
carbonation
and
refreshing
easy
to
put
a
couple
down
very
enjoyable
d
3
5
not
bad
just
not
great
i
would
take
and
oberon
or
most
other
wheat
offering
over
this
one
i
would
not
say
i
disliked
it
just
would
not
pursue
it
smell
rocks
weak
every
other
catergory
nice
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
dont
love
american
wheats
but
this
is
as
good
as
most
i
have
had
it
is
my
first
lazy
magnolia
that
was
bought
in
fl
a
light
beer
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
lightn
and
refreshing
an
easy
drinker
in
the
summer
as
intended
so
points
for
fulfilling
its
purpose
not
something
id
regularly
turn
to
but
worth
a
try
every
now
and
again
during
the
hot
days
yep
a
good
summer
beer
not
much
complexities
but
still
enjoyable
and
subtle
this
is
would
be
good
for
a
bbq
or
summer
party
had
this
the
other
night
after
work
poured
a
bronzecopper
color
with
thin
white
head
that
faded
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
smelled
spicy
with
a
little
bit
of
malts
tasted
spicy
coriander
and
slightly
citrusy
a
little
too
fizzy
for
me
and
while
i
didnt
have
to
struggle
to
drink
this
it
did
not
go
down
easy
this
one
drinks
quite
well
and
has
a
few
very
cool
twists
would
definitely
snag
a
sixer
of
this
every
now
and
then
if
it
was
readily
available
md
light
and
crisp
well
carbonated
and
easy
drinking
a
drinkable
wheat
but
a
little
too
much
of
the
forced
flavor
for
my
liking
bye
beer
is
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
tint
of
amber
to
it
the
head
is
about
avg
and
needed
some
work
to
have
it
form
well
the
aroma
is
faint
but
pleasant
of
a
orangy
tang
with
a
bit
of
zest
in
the
background
taste
is
a
pleasant
and
relaxed
experience
for
me
a
wheat
flavor
pushes
threw
with
a
malt
sweetness
in
the
background
with
just
hint
of
some
kind
of
bite
the
brew
is
a
tasty
and
light
brew
and
i
would
welcome
it
on
any
hot
day
drinkability
is
high
mainly
for
me
due
to
the
refreashing
light
flavor
and
body
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
but
soft
flavor
making
it
a
good
summer
sipper
the
spice
flavors
are
subtle
and
dont
get
in
the
way
of
the
malt
or
hops
the
spicing
is
just
enough
to
make
it
stand
out
a
bit
from
a
typical
american
pale
wheat
a
nice
warmweather
refresher
mouthfeel
some
carbonation
but
feels
more
like
a
light
beer
definitely
could
drink
a
sixpack
without
feeling
full
carbonation
is
nice
on
the
tongue
very
refreshing
beer
probably
good
in
the
ms
summer
easy
drinking
stuff
aroma
is
mostly
grain
but
a
bit
of
wet
cardboard
distracts
and
joins
the
mix
quaff
is
a
subdued
spice
and
coriander
with
a
sturdy
dose
of
wheat
and
a
soapy
finish
not
a
lot
of
depth
and
overall
rather
bland
drinkable
in
the
summer
heat
the
rest
of
the
sixer
will
be
some
lawnmower
brews
overall
a
very
nice
and
very
sessionable
little
ale
lots
of
depth
to
the
profile
and
a
smooth
and
very
nice
easy
drinking
to
it
i
would
go
here
again
for
sure
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
smooth
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
light
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
this
beer
has
renewed
my
faith
that
this
is
a
descent
drink
beer
the
spice
is
really
nice
addition
to
the
beer
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
im
not
nearly
as
impressed
with
this
one
as
i
have
been
with
my
previous
2
lm
beers
southern
pecan
and
jefferson
stout
as
im
not
exactly
sure
what
they
were
aiming
to
do
stylewise
that
said
its
still
fairly
drinkable
especially
on
a
warm
day
12oz
bottle
thanks
to
deepsouth
nice
golden
color
effervescent
bubbly
but
the
head
doesnt
last
for
shit
smells
like
spices
almost
belgian
but
not
quite
it
tasted
odd
and
i
honestly
couldnt
tell
if
they
were
shooting
for
a
belgian
witbier
or
an
american
wheat
it
was
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
was
still
confused
d
this
beer
could
be
a
very
refreshing
and
sessionable
beer
but
the
spiciness
on
the
tongue
is
really
ruining
it
for
me
but
it
might
be
your
thing
so
give
the
latest
offering
from
lazy
magnolia
a
shot
o
not
a
terrible
beer
the
orange
is
a
little
overemphasized
for
my
taste
a
good
session
beer
if
you
like
the
taste
i
would
love
this
beer
if
they
backed
off
on
the
orange
flavor
and
fixed
the
fizzy
carbonation
level
pours
a
perfectly
clear
dark
gold
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
after
just
a
few
secondsits
not
the
glass
either
smells
faintly
of
slightly
tart
wheat
some
orange
and
coriander
not
a
whole
lot
there
really
the
flavor
is
on
the
weak
side
as
well
after
an
initially
shock
of
wheat
and
citrus
it
finishes
like
spiced
water
light
feel
its
best
quality
is
its
drinkability
its
quite
mildit
would
certainly
be
nice
on
summer
day
on
the
gulf
coast
mouthfeel
like
most
of
the
lazy
magnolia
offerings
is
a
bit
thin
it
does
have
really
nice
carbonation
drinkability
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
be
outstanding
otherwise
its
just
okay
overall
this
is
a
pretty
hohum
beer
that
really
doesnt
stand
up
to
my
lm
favorites
southern
pecan
and
the
jefferson
stout
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
is
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
think
ill
revisit
it
drinks
with
ease
indian
summer
is
a
great
tasting
local
brew
i
described
it
once
as
like
the
feeling
you
get
early
in
the
morning
after
you
drink
a
glass
of
the
best
orange
juice
one
of
my
favorites
if
you
get
the
chance
at
least
try
it
its
a
good
session
beer
for
hot
days
i
was
not
impressed
by
the
smell
kinda
wheaty
not
really
all
that
good
the
first
glass
i
pored
had
a
nice
head
the
rest
of
them
didnt
this
beer
is
better
then
it
smells
though
pretty
interesting
like
a
spicy
wheat
beer
not
strong
tasting
at
all
though
i
might
buy
a
cask
of
this
again
next
summer
on
a
cook
out
but
other
then
that
i
am
going
to
hold
out
for
the
bottled
version
which
should
be
coming
this
way
pretty
soon
its
a
clear
light
yellow
gold
with
a
white
foamy
head
doesnt
look
like
much
nose
is
sweet
wheaty
hops
gentle
but
nice
taste
is
very
floral
hops
with
oranges
and
sugar
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
pretty
good
slight
mustiness
mouthfeel
falls
flat
low
alcohol
had
one
of
these
poured
at
the
govt
street
grocery
in
ocean
springs
ms
appearance
is
gold
with
orangy
tints
and
has
a
thin
white
head
it
smells
of
citrusy
hops
with
a
little
spice
the
taste
was
not
too
goodartificial
orange
flavor
some
hops
with
a
hint
of
berries
mouthfeel
was
only
average
fairly
clean
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
because
its
essentially
a
blue
moon
knockoff
with
overpowering
orange
flavor
d
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
it
is
cool
and
crisp
but
still
has
the
citrus
and
sweetness
you
are
looking
for
is
such
a
brew
really
enjoyable
and
a
good
follow
up
to
the
southern
pecan
pours
a
wheat
yellow
with
an
orange
glowing
tint
little
to
no
head
coming
off
the
cask
pretty
clear
and
light
looking
as
one
would
figure
with
a
summer
beer
doesnt
really
smell
too
strongly
but
has
hints
of
light
hops
and
a
malty
aroma
it
tastes
really
good
especially
on
a
hot
muggy
day
after
the
magic
city
brewfest
it
tastes
of
subtle
malt
and
a
little
citrus
twist
as
it
goes
to
the
throat
very
light
and
fluffy
mouthfeel
and
extremely
drinkable
looking
forward
to
more
of
these

just
had
from
the
bottle
still
kind
of
bland
i
really
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
this
beer
i
see
that
it
is
listed
as
a
pale
wheat
ale
word
has
it
lazy
mag
will
begin
bottling
their
brew
this
month
not
sure
about
the
distribution

a
great
wheat
ale
was
very
impressed
by
it
would
definitely
recommend
to
any
beer
drinker
incredibly
full
mouthfeel
what
a
wheat
drinkable
and
round
and
solid
very
solid
wheat
beer
has
a
subtle
sweetness
to
the
aftertaste
fairly
light
overall
but
heavy
enough
to
compliment
the
flavor
easy
to
drink
solid
light
beer
a
solid
delicious
refreshing
wheat
beer
rating
a
more
sweetness
and
the
same
wheat
is
the
primary
flavor
but
its
short
of
bready
that
artificial
peach
candy
note
is
evident
along
with
hints
of
tangerine
and
floral
hop
bitterness
remains
juicy
without
ample
hoppiness
even
the
body
seems
like
a
glaze
in
the
mouth
wet
enough
to
wash
down
but
this
would
be
better
if
it
was
drier
more
bubbles
would
help
also
the
finish
becomes
minerally
strange
for
the
style
just
not
much
there
overall
a
rather
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
with
a
good
blend
of
citrus
and
wheat
a
nice
summer
style
brew
crusty
wheat
with
a
nice
citrus
aspect
complimenting
that
i
applaud
brewers
who
still
make
beers
like
this
today
when
hops
barrels
and
adjuncts
are
starting
to
rule
the
world
simple
on
the
surface
but
solid
its
a
good
wheat
beer
they
arent
aiming
to
make
a
unique
and
original
beer
and
thats
what
i
like
about
it
the
most
it
is
very
simple
and
just
easy
to
enjoy
not
a
must
have
but
not
bad
would
definitely
buy
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
it
o
simple
but
gratifying
as
a
good
american
wheat
ale
should
be
many
view
the
style
as
being
rather
boring
and
uninspired
but
when
you
come
across
a
wellcrafted
brew
like
this
you
can
appreciate
the
simple
pleasures
it
has
to
offer
it
makes
for
a
great
summer
quaff
or
beach
beer
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
as
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
ubiquitous
sam
summer
you
may
find
that
it
scratches
that
summer
wheat
beer
itch
even
better
overall
this
is
exactly
how
i
want
my
wheat
beers
very
refreshing
with
a
clean
citric
quality
sampled
a
12
oz
tulip
glass
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
odd
serving
choice
for
an
american
wheat
but
they
do
that
with
the
more
pricy
us
imports
this
one
is
a
semicloudy
bright
yellow
brew
maybe
just
a
hint
of
orange
with
a
light
spray
of
white
bubbles
riding
on
top
aroma
is
bright
and
citric
with
lemon
and
orange
hops
front
and
center
wheat
spice
and
doughy
sweet
rolls
in
the
background
tastes
like
dilute
orange
juice
or
vitamin
c
chews
lemon
rind
gummy
worms
perhaps
a
little
noble
hop
peppered
flower
water
sweet
and
hoppy
for
an
american
wheat
and
fucking
tasty
on
a
certain
level
e
g
if
you
are
sitting
outside
and
its
blazing
hot
like
some
ahole
squeezed
a
citrus
wedge
into
the
beer
except
no
one
actually
did
thank
god
this
is
all
hops
doing
the
talking
rather
fizzy
and
has
an
interesting
slick
almost
oily
mouthfeel
but
finishes
crisp
dry
and
clean
as
expected
gotta
say
this
stands
out
from
the
pedestrian
mass
of
dull
safe
american
wheat
beers
and
does
so
quite
handily
if
i
were
to
compare
it
to
an
aggressively
hopped
wheat
like
lagunitas
little
sumpin
this
is
like
a
little
brother
session
alternative
with
hop
flavor
trumping
the
bitterness
a
decent
americanoriented
wheat
ale
the
fruitiness
i
e
lemon
character
going
a
long
way
in
differentiating
this
from
the
dregs
of
the
masses
of
the
style
hardly
mindblowing
but
agreeable
enough
especially
as
a
potential
harbinger
of
the
days
where
i
can
kick
back
on
my
new
houses
deck
with
a
few
rounds
of
this
kind
of
thing
my
wife
put
it
wonderfully
this
would
be
a
great
beer
at
the
end
of
the
night
where
you
dont
want
to
drink
any
more
of
your
regular
beer
but
dont
want
to
stop
drinking
great
third
or
fourth
beer
to
cleanse
the
palate
to
me
this
beer
definitely
screams
northern
california
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
lemony
flavors
make
the
taste
a
little
more
palatable
it
does
not
stand
up
to
other
north
coast
offerings
quite
plain
and
assertive
but
still
a
very
refreshing
american
wheat
a
session
summer
beer
c
o
okay
beer
without
a
whole
lot
of
character
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
outside
o
an
exceptionally
refreshing
barleywheat
ale
with
fine
citrus
overtones
drinkability
a
good
refreshing
beer
would
be
great
for
a
outside
barbque
with
friends
and
i
know
youre
not
supposed
to
drink
iced
cold
beer
but
this
one
may
be
good
a
little
extra
cold
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
disappates
to
a
rim
around
the
glass
aroma
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
some
pilsner
hops
present
flavor
is
dry
to
start
and
finishes
with
the
pilsner
slight
presence
of
citrus
maybe
some
grapefruit
and
lemon
clean
and
refreshing
brew
and
would
be
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
light
color
almost
like
apple
cider
very
light
in
the
taste
a
weiss
bier
taste
without
the
fullness
not
much
to
say
for
taste
nice
and
frothy
a
little
hoppy
for
a
wheat
beer
a
simple
wheat
beer
probably
for
people
who
want
to
try
wheat
beers
but
are
not
into
them
crisp
overall
i
like
it
it
is
very
refreshing
and
has
a
nice
flavor
that
i
guess
is
that
of
yeast
it
hits
the
spot
and
is
totally
sessionable
othere
is
a
reason
gumballheads
label
has
a
line
about
a
wheat
beer
that
doesnt
suck
this
beer
isnt
awful
but
brings
little
to
the
table
this
was
a
beer
that
cried
out
to
be
agitated
before
the
pour
well
actually
it
was
hard
to
hear
what
it
was
saying
over
the
howling
of
hurricanetropical
storm
sandy
but
i
extrapolated
based
on
previous
knowledge
as
such
i
got
a
finger
of
thin
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
off
of
my
pour
chalk
the
dying
head
up
to
barometric
conditions
which
are
less
than
optimal
right
now
color
was
a
deeply
cloudy
orangishyellow
nose
was
very
wheatlike
with
that
sweetish
scent
that
wheat
imparts
in
beer
i
always
think
of
my
pops
and
his
wheaties
when
i
was
a
kid
when
i
smell
it
in
beer
no
question
in
my
mind
that
wheat
malts
were
in
play
here
mouthfeel
was
medium
it
had
a
slight
lemony
tartness
on
the
tongue
which
another
feature
of
wheat
beers
finish
was
semidry
and
very
refreshing
this
would
be
an
excellent
summertime
beer
no
wow
factor
here
but
its
still
a
decent
wheat
ale
i
liked
it
overall
i
like
it
it
has
a
very
refreshing
taste
and
is
certainly
very
drinkable
would
go
well
with
heavy
foods
like
pizza
and
goulash
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
wheat
some
lemon
taste
is
refreshing
malts
a
bit
of
hops
some
lemon
is
present
very
easy
drinking
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
best
enjoyed
during
the
summer
blue
star
is
a
simple
easy
drinking
pale
wheat
ale
the
low
abv
and
relatively
straight
forward
yet
interesting
oldschool
flavor
profile
would
make
this
an
ideal
session
beer
although
not
good
enough
for
me
to
seek
out
in
abq
i
would
give
this
strong
consideration
if
i
stumbled
across
it
in
a
grocery
store
while
looking
for
a
solid
wheat
beer
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
small
one
finger
white
head
the
taste
and
smell
is
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
i
was
expecting
from
north
coast
it
has
a
smooth
and
light
wheat
body
there
is
a
good
deal
of
light
malts
and
i
get
a
tiny
bit
of
rye
for
the
low
abv
this
beer
has
a
nice
feel
drinkable
and
not
watery
a
decent
enough
wheat
ale
definitely
not
up
to
par
with
oberon
in
my
opinion
but
a
decent
enough
beer
to
enjoy
your
evening
with
turns
the
style
on
its
ear
nothing
soft
or
bread
or
sweet
here
aggressive
and
bitter
and
a
little
harsh
this
could
work
well
with
food
i
have
some
trouble
going
beyond
one
of
these
at
a
time
though
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
2
inch
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
and
malt
mainly
with
maybe
some
light
citrus
aromas
taste
is
of
malt
and
wheat
with
a
herbal
and
citrus
zest
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
there
is
also
a
weird
slightly
funky
aftertaste
that
comes
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
wheat
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
after
again
o
i
hold
oberon
has
the
gold
standard
for
wheat
pale
ales
this
brew
can
stand
up
against
it
balance
is
key
here
you
get
just
enough
of
both
the
barley
malt
and
the
nobel
hops
its
highly
quaffable
and
highly
recommended
o
would
not
suggest
would
choose
anothernew
wheat
over
this
all
it
does
well
is
the
citrustartyeast
overload
sampled
on
april
14
2012
the
color
is
golden
yellow
with
busy
carbonation
and
a
long
lasting
foamy
offwhite
head
there
is
a
little
wheat
on
the
nose
but
the
aroma
tends
to
be
more
hopped
and
citrusbased
the
body
is
actually
kind
of
nice
with
a
medium
texture
and
smooth
the
taste
is
grainy
and
hoppy
this
beer
has
a
bigger
bitter
punch
than
most
wheats
i
have
had
so
in
that
regard
it
is
unique
a
cellar
temperature
that
was
shipped
to
me
from
ca
is
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
cloudy
and
has
a
golden
wheat
color
a
small
white
foam
head
sits
on
top
a
decent
amount
of
rising
carbonation
can
be
seen
within
aromas
of
wheat
and
some
pale
malt
sweetness
can
be
smelled
coming
off
of
the
beer
the
beer
has
a
very
pleasing
pale
wheat
flavor
there
is
a
healthy
amount
of
grain
here
but
it
isnt
too
sweet
the
noble
hops
and
some
balance
but
they
do
not
posess
a
very
strong
flavor
they
may
add
to
the
kiss
of
spiciness
in
the
finish
but
that
could
be
only
the
yeast
like
many
beers
of
this
style
this
ones
tastes
refreshing
and
would
probably
be
best
consumed
on
a
warm
day
its
medium
body
isnt
sticky
and
the
carbonation
levels
are
just
right
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
though
not
impressive
enough
for
me
to
have
it
shipped
across
country
again
as
there
are
many
fine
examples
produced
closer
to
home
for
anyone
on
the
west
coast
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
i
would
never
have
guessed
that
this
was
a
wheat
beer
but
that
does
not
make
it
a
bad
beer
with
spring
on
the
horizon
i
am
looking
for
brews
suitable
to
warmer
weather
food
from
the
grillsmoker
and
a
refresher
after
mowing
the
beer
had
little
lacing
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
mild
but
fresh
smell
it
constantly
streamed
bubbles
and
tingled
my
tongue
it
cleansed
my
palate
pleasingly
after
finishing
a
bowl
of
lobster
bisque
it
would
pair
well
with
bbq
sauces
and
burgers
the
aftertaste
was
mild
and
refreshing
it
would
be
a
nice
session
drink
while
sitting
on
the
deck
this
is
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
which
is
nice
but
the
flavor
profile
throws
me
the
lemony
orangey
taste
is
not
really
what
im
looking
for
this
would
probably
be
a
great
summer
beer
but
overall
im
unimpressed
o
as
the
temp
goes
up
down
a
few
of
these
very
enjoyable
wheat
beer
with
a
few
nice
surprises
o
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
this
and
am
not
a
big
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
was
definitely
a
job
well
done
for
north
coast
on
tap
at
local
habit
in
san
diego
i
liked
it
better
as
it
warmed
and
i
got
used
to
the
flavor
excellent
example
of
the
type
cloudy
golden
appearance
with
a
nice
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
nice
wheat
aroma
with
very
smooth
taste
resulting
in
very
refreshing
experience
very
drinkable
and
would
rate
this
as
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
ive
had
overall
average
but
wouldnt
have
again
overall
a
solid
american
wheat
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
consume
in
quantity
during
warmer
weather
or
any
other
time
for
that
matter
clean
and
drinkable
a
good
session
ale
pours
a
light
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
good
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
the
nose
is
wheat
hops
lemon
and
maybe
a
little
grass
thrown
in
there
very
light
and
not
offensive
taste
follows
suit
same
profile
as
the
nose
feel
is
very
light
with
average
carbonation
fairly
average
for
this
style
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
great
one
i
probably
wont
look
for
this
again
cheers
overall
a
great
wheat
beer
the
balance
is
what
sets
this
beer
apart
from
so
many
others
o
a
great
and
kind
of
different
wheat
beer
its
simplicity
is
what
makes
this
star
shine
strange
of
me
to
order
this
as
i
wasnt
really
in
the
wheat
beer
mood
but
then
i
rarely
am
so
i
figured
id
sample
it
poured
a
very
hazy
golden
yellow
nearly
opaque
with
a
small
cap
of
white
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
aroma
of
pale
malts
wheat
and
bready
yeast
similar
taste
with
notes
of
pale
malts
wheat
yeast
lemon
pith
and
apple
skins
pretty
nice
actually
even
if
not
overly
flavorful
or
distinctive
lightmedium
body
and
decently
drinkable
for
the
style
o
needs
to
be
a
tad
more
bitter
for
my
liking
but
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
again
another
beer
that
bmc
drinkers
will
not
be
shocked
by
on
the
other
hand
a
solid
beer
that
more
jaded
beer
drinkers
me
included
might
pass
up
in
favor
of
something
a
little
more
substantial
has
great
flavor
and
character
but
is
not
beefy
o
just
as
the
bottle
states
only
the
bare
ingredients
were
used
impressively
simple
and
quite
drinkable
overall
pleasant
enough
and
a
cut
above
average
for
the
style
batting
second
is
the
blue
star
wheat
ale
and
it
is
very
good
the
color
is
a
cloudy
yellow
with
thin
white
head
the
aroma
included
spice
and
citrus
the
taste
is
very
good
starts
spicy
then
comes
hints
of
citrus
with
a
final
spice
on
the
pallet
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
good
wheat
o
could
have
used
more
wheat
flavor
and
less
blandness
d
overall
good
drink
i
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
handle
not
a
bad
summer
drink
i
like
the
orangepeach
blend
in
this
drink
this
wheat
is
not
that
overpowering
and
the
fruits
stand
out
very
well
o
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
its
lightness
makes
a
great
choice
for
summer
days
because
the
beer
goes
down
easy
and
can
be
enjoyed
in
bbq
parties
etc
but
at
the
same
time
the
taste
wasnt
as
complete
as
i
was
hoping
for
o
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
know
its
supposed
to
be
light
and
refreshing
in
flavor
but
i
still
felt
this
could
use
more
and
what
flavors
were
there
were
not
the
best
i
would
drink
the
anchor
fff
lagunitas
or
sn
versions
over
this
any
day
overall
good
run
of
the
mill
wheat
its
cheap
and
tasty
just
the
way
i
like
my
hookers
pours
a
hazy
pale
honey
golden
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
is
wheaty
and
fruity
the
latter
component
almost
entirely
apple
and
has
a
hint
of
honey
wheaty
flavor
has
a
subtle
apple
undertone
smooth
slightly
fizzy
texture
is
just
a
teensy
watery
but
still
acceptable
plenty
of
head
on
top
of
the
cloudy
bright
body
super
clean
aroma
with
wheat
sharpness
and
a
delightful
yeast
dance
in
your
nose
its
crisp
and
refreshing
and
sharp
low
abv
makes
it
extremely
sessionable
its
hard
not
to
just
chug
it
great
straight
out
of
the
bottle
too
highly
recommended
overall
a
nice
hoppy
wheat
beer
by
no
means
a
hopfenweisse
but
it
doesnt
proclaim
to
be
great
summer
drinking
and
as
im
drinking
this
in
the
middle
of
winter
it
is
good
enough
to
be
had
all
year
round
o
a
decent
wheat
but
not
a
choice
for
the
style
nice
cloudy
gold
color
creates
a
rocky
white
head
on
top
great
retention
lots
of
sticky
lace
the
nose
is
sharp
with
hops
a
nice
clean
fruity
balance
and
mild
grainy
finish
good
nose
the
body
is
firm
with
oily
moments
carbonation
must
have
put
all
its
strength
into
the
foam
at
the
top
as
this
lacks
a
needed
bite
a
little
slick
at
times
the
noble
hops
make
their
presence
known
with
a
nice
bitter
start
mild
yeasty
tartness
in
the
middle
and
a
smooth
bready
finish
with
oatlike
characteristics
good
hoppy
wheat
here
i
like
it
not
one
of
my
goto
styles
but
this
beer
was
a
treat
great
summer
brew
a
simple
refreshing
wheat
ale
with
enough
flavour
to
be
worth
drinking
but
maybe
just
a
little
too
much
body
to
truly
be
quaffable
final
notes
the
wheat
beer
lover
would
probably
enjoy
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
even
compare
to
the
true
german
weizenbiers
definitely
tolerable
though
o
a
decent
pale
wheat
has
nice
flavors
just
a
tad
bit
muted
tastefresh
wheat
cracker
malt
biscuit
lemon
zest
nice
spicy
hop
prescence
makes
itself
known
and
provides
a
wonderfull
balance
and
flavor
very
refreshing
and
tasty
great
flavor
and
character
in
a
wheat
ale
another
winner
from
north
coast
salute
the
summer
with
a
case
of
these
yummy
this
wheat
beer
pours
out
as
a
cloudy
yellowish
orange
color
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
before
is
settled
and
turned
into
just
a
thin
little
coating
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
this
brew
was
of
grains
and
wheat
the
taste
was
soft
with
lots
of
wheat
grains
and
malts
there
wasnt
much
of
a
hop
flavor
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
is
worth
having
in
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
overall
its
an
ok
brew
north
coast
has
much
better
beers
out
there
overall
i
like
how
sweet
this
beer
was
and
close
to
style
i
would
pick
up
the
pilsner
just
to
tick
it
since
it
may
also
be
well
done
a
definite
summer
ale
on
a
hot
day
where
american
wheat
ales
are
generally
less
favorable
to
more
authentic
german
counterparts
this
one
falls
a
hair
better
than
average
in
this
lesser
catagory
but
on
a
90
degree
day
at
the
ball
park
this
one
is
welcome
in
my
cup
flavor
is
light
easygoing
with
a
little
citrus
spice
blue
star
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
and
likely
a
superlative
gateway
to
craft
beers
solid
and
worthy
drinkability
quite
drinkable
but
not
an
outstanding
beer
i
could
have
another
but
i
probably
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
beer
d
not
very
satisfying
leaves
you
hollow
il
be
sticking
to
oberon
and
gumbalhead
final
thought
wheat
beer
isnt
my
style
but
i
could
hang
with
this
one
every
so
often
when
its
nice
and
warm
outside
pours
a
very
hazed
yellowish
orange
color
with
a
thick
yellowish
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
coriander
orange
and
wheat
tastes
of
wheat
coriander
spice
and
citrus
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
i
like
this
one
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
a
little
grainy
but
not
bad
it
has
a
decent
finish
but
there
isnt
much
in
the
flavor
department
not
much
at
all
its
a
throw
away
boring
average
beer
nothing
much
to
say
about
it
i
wont
have
it
again
d
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
shows
what
the
style
should
be
without
taking
a
brewers
approach
to
it
the
low
flavor
and
abv
makes
this
a
perfect
gateway
beer
i
am
always
impressed
with
north
coast
and
their
basic
yet
great
drinking
beers
d
a
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
offering
although
i
would
like
a
bit
more
depth
overall
a
nice
lightly
spiced
and
lightly
hoppy
wheat
still
clean
and
crisp
yet
with
a
bit
more
bite
to
keep
things
interesting
d
went
down
like
water
and
was
a
very
sessionable
that
you
can
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
the
drinkability
is
very
good
here
this
is
a
solid
wheat
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
that
ive
had
i
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
it
does
not
remind
me
of
a
german
hefe
but
is
not
bad
more
citrus
notes
and
a
little
thin
reminds
me
of
widmer
edit
after
trying
another
bottle
of
this
ive
found
that
the
unusual
sweetness
on
the
finish
tastes
just
like
gold
rum
im
not
sure
if
i
like
this
or
not
so
i
will
continue
through
the
six
pack
and
edit
again
with
a
verdict
dry
finish
gritty
taste
seems
like
the
malt
percentage
that
is
wheat
is
really
high
on
this
one
a
very
agreeable
beer
when
thats
what
you
are
looking
for
i
wonder
why
this
isnt
more
popular
given
some
of
the
ones
that
are
good
hydration
beer
to
be
honest
the
beer
is
a
bit
onedimensional
but
it
is
very
very
drinkable
i
could
put
down
quite
a
few
of
these
without
a
second
thought
this
beer
smells
very
heavily
of
wheat
and
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
it
has
a
smooth
mellow
taste
that
goes
down
on
the
lighter
side
and
oh
yeah
the
head
of
foam
stick
around
even
with
a
little
left
at
the
last
sip
can
tell
this
a
beer
is
made
with
quality
materials
definetly
worth
a
try
i
find
it
pretty
comparable
to
a
summer
ale
or
one
of
sam
adams
coastal
wheats
the
taste
is
similarly
mild
and
refreshing
i
would
like
to
try
one
again
although
wheat
beers
arent
my
favorite
style
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
enough
for
the
style
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
a
very
mild
and
subtle
beer
the
low
abv
lends
itself
to
the
classic
session
beer
requirements
damn
late
running
board
meetings
almost
missed
today
pours
a
tasty
gold
with
the
slightest
haze
to
it
lots
of
carbonation
and
almost
no
head
to
speak
of
but
there
is
a
bit
of
lace
kind
of
like
the
straight
a
high
school
girl
who
is
also
captain
of
the
cheerleaders
lots
of
lemon
and
citrus
in
the
nose
and
some
maltiness
flavor
is
wonderful
again
like
the
cheer
captain
bright
crisp
clean
but
also
very
full
of
wheat
and
long
on
the
finish
which
carries
a
great
bitter
balance
this
is
really
excellent
beer
and
as
drinkable
as
keg
beer
on
a
friday
night
after
the
big
game
really
well
priced
too
so
find
and
drink
up
kids
practice
tomrrow
morning
and
homework
d
i
plan
on
making
this
a
goto
summer
beer
assuming
i
can
find
it
in
illinois
d
session
brew
accommodating
and
rewarding
flat
out
just
a
great
drinker
d
good
summertime
quaffer
as
far
as
apwas
this
and
bells
oberon
are
the
only
ones
id
buy
again
just
read
about
the
three
floyds
take
havent
tried
it
yet
d
the
apwa
style
is
not
going
to
make
anyone
go
crazy
blue
star
and
gumballhead
are
about
as
good
as
it
gets
go
with
them
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
really
deep
rich
hue
and
a
pretty
nice
head
nose
is
not
profound
but
does
have
a
nice
mix
of
components
flavor
again
is
pretty
basic
but
has
a
nice
easy
balance
overall
this
is
pretty
good
quaff
d
fair
flavor
moderate
abv
and
refrewhing
finish
make
it
easily
drinkable
going
through
naked
pint
book
highly
recommended
and
trying
their
various
recommendations
for
good
examples
of
particular
styles
this
one
was
recommended
as
a
good
example
of
an
american
wheat
beer
its
everything
i
expected
smooth
not
hoppy
at
all
lightmedium
carbonation
yellow
to
goldish
color
just
nothing
ab
it
blew
me
away
i
guess
i
now
know
what
to
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
d
good
abv
a
great
balance
and
flavor
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
maybe
one
of
my
new
favorites
ill
look
out
for
this
one
over
the
summer
pours
an
apple
cider
brown
with
a
half
inch
off
white
head
sediment
dances
around
my
glass
smells
of
lemon
and
citrus
strong
yeast
orange
spice
clove
and
coriander
the
taste
is
sharp
but
short
grain
orange
rind
and
slightly
bitter
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
a
good
summer
brew
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
americanized
wheat
with
loads
of
hops
not
a
bad
thing
but
know
what
to
expect
drinkability
good
not
heavy
and
with
moderate
abv
no
problem
tossing
a
few
back
d
this
is
a
very
refreshing
thirst
quenching
brew
great
for
the
summer
and
extremely
drinkable
i
would
of
liked
a
bit
more
citrus
in
there
along
with
more
flavor
on
the
finish
but
still
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
though
in
fact
ill
still
be
looking
for
better
before
trying
this
one
again
m
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
lots
of
residual
sugars
left
in
here
carbonation
is
medium
too
adequate
but
less
than
id
expect
for
a
wheat
ale
d
solid
apwa
good
in
the
spring
and
summer
months
im
drinking
it
during
the
butthole
of
winter
because
i
didnt
know
what
this
was
until
i
took
a
closer
look
at
a
single
i
havent
seen
it
in
six
packs
in
the
store
i
normally
go
to
though
value
ive
seen
it
for
9
99
a
sixer
awesome
deal
d
a
good
summer
wheat
have
more
than
one
a
very
odd
beer
but
i
must
admit
the
more
i
drink
the
better
it
seems
to
taste
i
guess
you
just
need
to
get
acclimated
to
it
strangely
medicinal
with
virtually
no
hop
crispness
unfortunately
the
flavor
is
very
muddled
pours
into
a
new
belgium
balloon
as
a
nice
light
hazy
yellow
with
a
super
fast
white
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
the
wheat
smell
is
strong
but
appealing
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
one
in
my
opinion
is
very
smooth
and
tasteful
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
the
brew
rolling
easily
across
the
palate
not
too
malty
or
grainy
making
this
one
pretty
easy
to
drink
much
better
than
average
for
the
style
i
think
this
one
would
be
pretty
good
for
an
easy
drinking
warm
summer
day
overall
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
i
would
drink
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
is
decent
has
some
things
i
like
and
dont
like
to
it
drinkable
however
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
lovley
golden
color
minimal
lacing
minimal
head
smells
and
tastes
wheaty
of
course
with
some
mild
hoppiness
and
a
slight
honey
aftertaste
it
felt
a
bit
thin
on
my
pallate
good
drinkability
a
nice
beer
for
a
summer
afternoon
nothing
special
though
the
dinner
pairing
would
have
worked
fine
but
i
slathered
sriracha
all
over
my
chicken
to
add
some
flavor
and
the
spiciness
ended
up
overpowering
the
beer
drinkability
is
respectable
not
one
of
the
best
ncbc
offerings
but
a
semi
respectable
attempt
of
the
style
high
drinkability
as
the
low
alcohol
content
and
the
easy
drinking
make
this
a
great
summer
brew
d
it
would
be
a
decently
drinkable
beer
if
it
only
had
more
flavor
drinks
slow
not
that
interesting
just
another
wheat
beer
out
there
had
this
on
draft
a
decade
ago
in
san
francisco
thought
it
was
slightly
better
maybe
my
least
favorite
north
coast
brew
i
guess
the
5
remaining
will
get
choked
down
with
football
season
looming
so
this
is
what
a
west
coast
american
wheat
tastes
like
first
time
ive
had
a
apwa
that
pulled
that
much
hop
flavor
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
making
it
almost
look
like
juice
this
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
light
aroma
of
sweet
malts
and
some
citrus
taste
mimiced
the
aroma
but
wasnt
too
strong
carbonation
is
there
but
the
beer
felt
a
little
bit
too
thin
overall
a
good
beer
for
anyday
drinking
cloves
bananas
peach
and
some
spiciness
powerdy
yeastiness
in
the
flavor
too
peppery
spice
very
tasty
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
fairly
nice
drinker
not
a
bad
wheat
ale
poured
up
as
pale
wheat
ale
should
with
an
egg
yolk
yelloworange
colour
and
a
nice
sized
frothy
white
head
smell
was
pleasant
and
gentle
with
detectable
wheat
present
and
a
bit
of
what
i
perceived
to
be
a
mild
peppery
aroma
nice
taste
was
flavourful
again
with
the
presence
of
wheat
and
the
modest
peppery
nuance
mouthfeel
to
me
was
a
bit
heavy
considering
the
style
and
the
relatively
low
abv
i
was
somewhat
surprised
actually
overall
drinkability
is
about
average
i
would
say
its
no
3fs
gumball
head
to
be
sure
but
its
still
a
good
pale
wheat
i
would
buy
it
again
notes
the
first
north
coast
beer
that
i
would
pass
over
in
a
selection
of
same
style
offerings
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
i
would
have
it
again
im
not
rushing
out
to
get
it
but
it
is
good
drinkability
a
very
nice
brew
that
lacks
the
up
front
banana
and
clove
that
we
all
want
not
bad
though
drinkability
its
not
that
impressive
not
your
typical
wheat
it
certainly
lives
up
to
the
american
in
the
american
wheat
ale
style
however
its
not
offensive
and
is
smooth
drinking
overall
very
different
from
your
normal
wheat
beer
d
very
refreshing
low
abv
equals
something
extremely
drinkable
drinkability
fair
to
decent
id
do
it
again
but
give
this
to
someone
looking
for
a
widmer
of
a
blue
moon
and
they
might
come
over
to
our
side
average
color
for
unfiltered
wheat
beer
nothing
remarkable
in
the
flavor
department
not
complex
but
not
terrible
beyond
the
wheaty
and
pleasant
finish
not
much
flavor
at
all
perhaps
on
tap
and
very
very
cold
would
have
been
a
better
experience
solid
wheat
character
on
the
palatea
little
chewy
with
some
pleasant
prickliness
the
flavor
starts
out
a
little
fruity
a
twang
in
the
center
ending
with
a
little
spice
pretty
standard
stuff
here
pours
a
lightly
hazed
yelloworange
color
with
a
smallish
head
of
white
foam
nose
is
bright
fresh
citrus
lemon
and
tangerines
with
a
bit
of
wheat
and
peach
quite
light
and
dry
on
the
tongue
with
a
pronounced
husky
grain
flavour
and
something
resembling
those
fuzzy
peach
gummy
candies
some
orangey
hops
and
wheaty
twang
finish
this
off
carbonation
is
quite
hard
interesting
tasty
brew
suitable
for
summer
drinking
drinkable
but
nothing
id
reach
for
if
this
were
a
person
it
would
be
a
mid
level
human
resources

just
getting
by
picking
up

a

bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
very
well
carbonated
and
is
pretty
light
on

this
is
the
best
installment
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
to
this
point
i
can
see
it
being
pretty
darn
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
i
am
really
glad
we
can
finally
get
this
beer
here
in
town
better
then
the
average
wheatbeer
excellent
to
introduce
people
to
northcoast
brewery
also
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
thin
white
head
smelled
fairly
sweet
with
good
amounts
of
wheat
and
yest
tasted
sweet
with
a
quick
finish
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
with
decent
drinkability
i
was
fairly
disappointed
in
this
beer
while
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
it
i
was
just
expecting
more
and
was
a
little
disappointed
with
that
being
said
i
could
see
how
some
people
will
find
this
to
be
a
nice
summer
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
stays
a

of
thin

flavors
a
lighter
beer
with
background
citrus
taste
lemon
particularly
mouthfeel
was
good
just
as
in
any
other
wheat
beer
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
stood
out
about
this
beer
but
is
wasnt
bad
a
highly
drinkable
beer
sure
i
had
mine
in
the
completely
wrong
season
but
i
could
easily
see
having
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
bucket
of
ice
on
a
summer
day
very
refreshing
notes
definitely
one
of
the
best
wheats
i
have
ever
tasted

was
of
wheat
grain
taste
was
also
wheaty
but
of
little
else
mouthfeel
was
okay
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
which
coming
from
north
coast
surprises
me
maybe
i
got
an
old
one
the
yelloworange
hue
is
light
enough
for
the
cloudiness
to
show
fully
looks
warm
even
if
its
icy

otherwise
its
the
grain
hops
wheat
to
keep
things
more
tart

carbonation
really
works
to
lift
things
off
the
tongue
admirably
doesnt
leave
much
behind
after
you
swallow
not
out
to
overimpress
could
drink
a
lot
just
probably
not
remember
it

week
later

hot
day
kind
of
a
beer
i
had
this
one
at
north
coasts
taproom
they
served
it
with
a
slice
of
lemon
which
im
not
a
fan
of
mores
the
pity
even
so
i
found
this
to
have
relatively
good
flavor
for
a
wheat
beer
there
are
good
grain
notes
and
some
citrus
the
malt
comes
through
when
its
needed
the
beer
is
bright
yellow
with
some
haziness
although
it
was
hard
to
tell
how
much
that
lemon
was
altering
things
it
was
cold
and
foggy
when
i
had
this
beer
and
that
was
probably
not
the
optimal
setting
for
such
a
light
smooth
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
body
that
is
moderately
cloudy
and
leaves
a
onefinger
head
that
leaves
minor
lacings
the
smell
leaves
noticeable
aromas
of
fruit
and
yeast
but
not
so
much
malt
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
very
smooth
you
could
say
the
lack
of
malt
in
the
beer
hurts
it
if
you
like
a
dry
finish
nothing
too
good
to
brag
about
though
had
at
moes
in
lee
ma
d
pretty
refreshing
easy
to
session
great
hot
weather
beer
d
absolutely
drinkable
im
sad
i
didnt
discover
this
beer
until
the
end
of
the
summer
but
there
are
still
some
more
warm
texas
months
to
enjoy
this
beer
this
year
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
topped
with
a
moderate
offwhite
head
that
does
settle
down
a
bit
it
certainly
has
a
dirty
water
look
to
it
very
wheaty
aroma
with
hints
of
lemon
and
an
overall
fresh
type
of
smell
to
it
but
its
subtle
and
could
be
mistaken
for
the
smell
you
get
after
cleaning
your
house
the
flavor
is
mild
lemon
spice
with
a
mix
of
citrus
malts
its
not
a
bad
wheat
but
something
is
missing
to
make
it
a
good
beer
id
have
no
problem
having
it
again
on
a
hot
day
but
its
definitely
limited
and
for
the
record
if
im
going
to
drink
a
north
coast
brew
on
a
warm
day
ill
take
a
scrimshaw
pils
nice
beer
i
would
gladly
suck
on
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
medium
foamy
head
on
a
cloudy
light
orange
body
smelled
of
hoppiness
sweetness
with
hints
of
banana
and
cloves
as
well
as
caramel
there
was
no
hoppiness
in
the
taste
though
which
i
was
happy
about
the
orange
and
banana
came
through
in
the
taste
but
the
caramel
was
surprisingly
strong
but
in
a
good
way
also
surprising
was
the
smoothness
very
very
smooth
despite
a
more
than
average
carbonation
went
down
very
easily
a
good
wheat
not
among
the
greats
but
the
caramel
and
smoothness
really
made
it
a
good
brew
d
a
knockout
of
an
apwa
a
single
that
i
almost
didnt
buy
and
another
example
of
my
foolish
underestimation
suited
to
my
tastes
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
apwa
ive
ever
had
ever
recommended
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
not
quite
the
best
wheat
beer
but
its
still
a
decent
beer
to
pound
for
a
while
when
you
want
something
light
lightly
hazy
light
golden
wheat
with
a
fizzy
lid
of
offwhite
light
nose
of
softly
sweet
wheaty
grain
lightly
lemony
and
yeasty
estery
soft
lightmedium
body
with
modestly
creamy
carb
and
flavors
of
mellowly
sweettangy
wheat
with
some
lemony
citrus
and
estery
yeastiness
a
bit
of
spice
in
the
end
pleasant
and
sessionable
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
a
little
drying
wouldnt
be
that
bad
if
it
wasnt
for
the
plastic
taste
drinkability
quite
nice
this
was
kind
of
a
boob
of
a
beer
not
a
nice
young
firm
one
more
like
a
granny
teet
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
geez
such
a
simple
dumbed
down
beer
some
lacing
needs
more
everything
make
me
a
bike
clown
lacks
character
integrity
and
morals
and
fuck
the
people
who
ask
for
this
nice
semiclear
yellow
in
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
to
speak
of
subdued
aroma
of
bread
crust
and
some
citrus
with
a
nice
hop
profile
sitting
underneath
taste
is
clean
and
refreshing
with
a
bready
start
giving
way
to
just
enough
hops
to
make
it
interesting
and
finishing
sweetly
with
some
banana
peel
and
apple
medium
to
light
feel
but
with
more
carbonation
than
expected
helping
to
fill
it
out
on
this
96
degree
day
i
find
this
to
be
very
drinkable
but
all
in
all
i
dont
think
its
quite
enough
to
be
in
regular
rotation
poured
like
a
traditional
wheat
no
head
on
the
clear
straw
colored
pourhad
some
good
carbonation
as
it
bubbled
for
a
while
the
nose
was
wheat
and
floral
subtle
lemon
flavors
with
wheat
and
some
smoothness
to
it
but
not
ebough
wheat
for
me
not
a
fan
of
wheatshefes
but
this
one
did
not
have
enough
wheat
for
me
the
body
was
a
little
weak
not
much
backbone
and
nothing
really
spectacular
it
was
average
but
nothing
i
would
drink
again
notes
solid
stuff
excellent
for
long
sessions
bbqs
or
any
other
time
when
youd
want
a
simple
refreshing
beer
i
could
drink
a
whole
case
of
this
stuff
if
i
can
find
it
otherwise
ill
just
buy
a
good
amount
of
sixpacks
in
the
meantime
great
stuff
the
drinkability
is
ok
is
this
is
a
style
you
like
otherwise
it
is
pretty
average
and
not
worth
seeking
out
mk
sudsy
slickclean
and
refreshing
high
levels
of
carbonation
but
easily
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
it
pours
a
very
pale
almost
shocking
golden
color
with
a
sizable
head
that
lingers
longer
than
one
would
expect
it
lacks
much
in
the
way
of
an
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
pleasantly
wheaty
with
overtones
of
tropical
fruit
it
has
a
satisfying
mouthfeel
the
flavor
and
texture
sustain
through
to
the
finish
this
is
a
solid
american
wheat
and
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
i
dont
know
that
it
lives
up
to
the
excellence
of
some
other
north
coast
offerings
but
neither
is
it
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
easy
drinker
although
overall
i
was
thoroughly
unimpressed
on
the
chance
the
bottle
was
bad
i
may
edit
later
on
but
i
have
a
feeling
the
bottle
wasnt
bad
its
just
a
fairly
unimpressive
example
of
the
style
semihazy
blonde
in
appearance
with
a
low
dense
head
on
top
the
aroma
brings
out
some
fruit
notes
and
some
hops
as
well
the
begining
of
each
drink
crisp
wheat
malt
a
twang
of
fruit
and
a
moderate
representation
of
hops
for
the
style
as
a
beer
this
is
solid
keep
it
cold
for
a
warm
day
and
enjoy
final
thoughts
very
light
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
despite
its
debits
its
certainly
not
my
favorite
among
this
style
but
its
still
good
a
cloudy
yellow
beer
had
a
small
white
head
that
evaporated
before
i
even
got
the
glass
to
my
lips
there
is
a
light
wheat
aroma
with
hints
of
herbs
and
spices
in
the
background
light
and
lemony
with
a
nice
herbal
character
and
a
hint
of
clove
in
the
background
while
i
dont
generally
like
american
wheat
beers
this
had
more
flavor
and
character
than
most
of
the
rest
cracked
a
bottle
open
after
a
long
bike
ride
and
this
really
hit
the
spot
light
and
refreshing
yet
full
of
flavor
the
wheat
malt
isnt
as
clean
as
id
expect
for
an
american
wheat
its
a
pleasant
sweet
bread
flavor
balanced
by
the
malt
are
very
fruity
hops
lots
of
citrus
and
no
harsh
bitterness
theres
also
a
little
kick
of
yeasty
earthyness
all
in
all
this
is
relatively
complex
session
beer
at
times
i
got
a
slight
cilantro
aroma
which
makes
me
think
they
used
summit
hops
i
also
could
have
used
a
little
bitterness
but
maybe
thats
just
me
drinkability
an
easy
drinker
sessionable
i
guess
for
me
this
is
just
another
american
wheat
beer
i
put
two
of
these
in
a
mixed
6
pack
it
will
be
a
long
while
before
i
buy
this
again
perfect
hazy
golden
pour
with
a
big
lasting
white
head
in
a
weizen
glass
smell
is
lemony
lightly
wheaty
and
refreshingly
simple
taste
is
fairly
light
lemony
very
mildly
wheat
and
a
bit
of
tartness
perfectly
crisp
bite
and
finish
yet
smooth
at
the
same
time
a
nice
wheat
which
although
lacking
some
flavor
is
a
good
easy
drinking
summer
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
pretty
dark
orange
color
without
alot
of
head
has
a
ton
of
sediment
in
it
lots
of
big
chunks
floating
around
in
there
smell
is
kinda
weak
but
not
bad
just
doesnt
jump
out
at
me
like
other
beers
but
to
its
defense
im
not
using
the
proper
vessel
the
taste
is
good
though
has
your
normal
citrus
flavor
but
has
a
little
more
body
to
it
than
other
wheat
beers
from
what
i
can
remember
alot
of
wheat
beers
are
kinda
weak
when
it
comes
to
alcohol
volume
and
such
this
beer
keeps
up
a
more
normal
45
range
good
beer
all
around
poured
out
a
light
hazy
color
small
head
retention
good
clove
and
banana
aromas
finished
witha
slight
lemony
bite
thank
god
the
bartender
knows
better
than
to
put
a
lemon
in
any
of
my
beers
nice
light
crisp
mouthfeel
i
would
compare
this
more
to
the
kristallweizens
i
had
in
deutchland
rather
than
a
hefe
makes
drinkability
high
and
a
very
enjoyable
amer
wheat
for
the
summer
to
look
foward
to
pours
a
pale
golden
body
that
is
moderately
cloudy
and
leaves
a
onefinger
head
that
leaves
minor
lacings
the
smell
leaves
noticeable
aromas
of
fruit
and
yeast
but
not
so
much
malt
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
very
smooth
with
the
citrus
and
yeast
a
little
overpowering
the
hops
for
a
sweeter
drink
but
i
am
not
complaining
you
could
say
the
lack
of
malt
in
the
beer
hurts
it
if
you
like
a
dry
finish
but
i
think
for
an
american
pale
wheat
it
was
nice
having
a
smooth
flow
nothing
too
complex
here
to
write
about
but
i
bought
a
6pack
the
other
day
and
it
is
gone
taste
is
mild
citrus
is
up
front
orange
rind
good
carbonation
the
finish
is
also
strong
such
as
yeast
and
a
little
sour
good
drinking
this
beer
smelled
hoppy
with
a
faint
bit
of
citrus
and
wheat
breadish
the
taste
was
kind
of
bland
moved
from
the
malts
to
a
strong
wheat
aftertaste
that
lets
you
know
its
a
wheat
it
was
easy
to
drink
due
to
it
being
a
watery
wheat
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
offering
but
thats
not
to
say
i
would
never
have
it
again
overall
not
bad
i
was
really
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
but
to
be
honest
i
have
had
much
worse
this
was
definitly
a
quality
beer
and
something
that
i
would
probably
not
buy
again
but
would
not
snub
my
nose
at
it
either
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
unfiltered
and
cloudy
as
expected
and
appears
a
yelloworange
color
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
head
comprised
of
many
fine
bubbles
the
smell
is
what
you
might
expect
from
an
american
wheat
beer
wheat
duh
a
hint
of
citrus
fruitiness
and
maybe
just
a
touch
of
yeast
the
taste
is
much
the
same
starts
slightly
sweet
with
the
wheat
and
citrus
notes
shining
through
but
it
finishes
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
is
transparent
in
the
smell
making
for
a
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
lightmedium
body
with
a
fairly
agressive
carbonation
that
suits
the
beer
well
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
sessionable
beer
quaffable
even
good
example
of
an
apwa
blue
star
great
american
wheat
beer
pours
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
touch
of
lemon
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
light
flavor
you
can
taste
the
wheat
and
then
theres
some
lemon
a
simple
sessionable
beer
when
i
poured
it
i
thought
that
it
looked
like
lemon
juice
it
ended
up
being
a
telltale
sign
the
lemon
flavor
is
very
heavy
but
not
so
overpowering
that
it
ruins
the
beer
in
its
entirety
i
felt
i
will
admit
that
i
like
strong
flavors
in
a
beer
so
anything
that
is
very
full
will
most
likely
get
more
points
from
me
it
might
be
so
strong
that
it
makes
it
that
you
have
to
dig
that
lemon
flavor
in
your
wheat
beer
or
full
flavors
in
general
otherwise
you
might
not
appreciate
it
that
much
theres
a
fair
amount
of
hops
though
they
do
weave
in
and
out
a
bit
enough
to
make
it
stand
out
a
bit
in
its
style
alltogether
a
fine
refresher
and
better
than
the
runofthe
mill
apwa
my
friend
picked
up

not
really
a

feels
dry
in

a

the
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
forming
a
1
inch
head
that
quickly
fades
leaving
light
spots
of
lace
the
aroma
is
a

light
mix

hops
the
taste

overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
i
wasnt
dissappointed
not
too
much
flavor
is
present
but
i
can
see
this
being
an
afternoon
summer
beer
worth
a
try
just
okay
thirstquenching
but
not
tasty
this
is
a
very
light
and
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
the
summer
pours
out
a
murky
nectarine
with
a
thick
3
finger

that
maintains
its
fluffy
and
dimpled
presence
for

smells
like
malted

pale

citrus

come
out
most
in

flavor
with
the
wheat
and
malt
more
in

some
apricot
too

is
light

some
weight

i
sip
again
a
bit
of
a

with

no

still
adept
for
picking
one
up

of
hops
much
like
the
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bland
offering
that
really
does
not
have
any
qualities
that
stand
out
in
any
way
to
make
me
want
to
drink
another
this
is
one
beer
that
i
will
be
rereviewing
in
the
future
and
i
will
be
discussing
this
with
my
beer
hook
up
to
obtain
a
better
sample
dirty
yellow
with
not
so
great
head
and
lackluster
retention
smell
is
a
wheat
field
malty
and
cool
after
this
the
taste
is
surprising
american
micro
toffee
with
plenty
of
fluffy
wheat
and
a
late
sting
of
hops
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
this
feels
nice
going
down
and
is
damn
drinkable
bought
this
beer
at
the
premiere
store
as
a
single
bottle
very
very
carbonated
almost
like
a
sodafizz
to
it
very
refreshing
beer
that
was
very
easy
to
drink
light
bitterness
and
a
good
citrus
smell
to
it
if
your
not
too
crazy
into
bitter
pale
beers
this
one
is
a
good
american
pale
wheat
to
have
very
easy
on
the
taste
buds
but
not
with
a
lack
of
flavor
drinkability
a
good
session
pick
probably
would
be
ideal
with
anything
off
the
grill
d
i
love
wheat
beers
and
this
is
just
not
the
example
i
was
looking
for
its
too
thin
too
watery
too
overcarbonated
and
too
acidic
12
oz
bottle
color
of
pale
hazy
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
nose
of
cereal
dried
bananas
slight
cloves
sweet
lemon
and
barnyard

taste
of
citrus
wheat
yeast
and
that
sweet
lemon
body
sparkely
and
with
sight
acidity

aftertaste
of
sour
acidic
and
cereal
drinkability
easy
drinking
like
most
wheat
beers
a
good
tart
taste
good
stuff
d
aw
its
ok
i
guess
id
take
it
again
over
macro
swill
but
i
hope
to
never
be
in
that
position
otherwise
i
dont
see
it
in
the
fridge
again
pretty
decent
but
really
not
all
that
remarkable
very
nice
pour
there

lemon
yellow
with
a
pillowy
white
head
and
nice
laces
which
can
be
hard
to
come
by
with
a
wheat
pours
an
opaque
whitegold
with
next
to
no
head
which
is
disappointing
aromas
hint
at
sweetness
beneath
a
bit
of
caramel
in
there
along
with
a
few
more
fruity
esters
of
the
citrus
variety
pretty
typical
for
an
american
wheat
beer
mildly
citric
very
little
spice
on
the
tongue
the
citrus
flavors
are
the
biggest
story
here
at
first
the
beer
is
sharply
carbonated
and
a
little
sweet
but
at
the
midpalate
it
starts
to
dry
out
with
the
citrusy
acid
components
taking
over
the
finish
is
quite
dry
and
slightly
bitter
with
lingering
tingles
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
very
good
wheat
beer
for
an
american
producer
its
slick
and
refreshing
enough
to
suit
many
palates
but
has
enough
citrus
notes
to
interest
those
looking
for
style
points
rather
good
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
hefes
or
wheat
beers
in
general
and
that
is
probably
why
i
enjoyed
this
very
mild
wheat
beer
a
cloudy
as
one
would
expect
in
a
wheat
beer
s
grainy
and
yeasty
aromas
with
a
fair
amount
of
lemony
zest
t
very
smooth
and
no
yeast
induced
bite
that
i
find
unappealing
in
most
wheat
beers
m
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
feel
that
is
smoother
than
usual
for
a
weizen
d
all
in
all
a
drinkable
mild
wheat
beer
that
is
best
suited
for
warm
weather
consumption
d
overall
id
say
this
is
a
good
am
pale
wheat
ale
overall
an
apwa
i
can
enjoy
usually
this
style
falls
short
compared
to
many
others
with
wheat
imho
but
this
is
quite
enjoyable
crisp
and
light
but
enough
complexity
to
keep
it
interesting
a
mediocre
beer
that
has
the
look
and
feel
of
a
wheat
beer
but
with
a
taste
that
is
really
lacking
not
bad
just
uninspiring
really
overpriced
so
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
a
sweet
barley
wheaty
intro
with
an
earthy
malt
coming
through
till
the
the
hops
kick
in
giving
a
bitter
and
crisp
finish
too
this
brew
the
alcohol
goes
unnoticed
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tangy
as
well
as
grainy
flavor
texture
to
this
unique
wheat
beer
a
bit
of
a
lemony
aftertaste
quite
refreshing
and
ultra
easy
to
drink
a
good
summer
sessioner
thats
worth
tasting
while
its
not
outstanding
anywhere
each
part
has
just
enough
going
on
to
be
credible
and
its
here
that
it
comes
together
with
the
light
airy
nature
making
it
quite
drinkable
i
wont
look
here
ot
be
wowed
because
that
wont
happen
but
on
a
damned
hot
night
like
tonight
it
has
a
refreshing
spin
that
makes
it
a
decent
option
d
i
think
this
is
best
served
when
in
need
of
refreshment
im
beginning
to
think
that
pale
wheats
are
just
not
my
thing
though
this
is
one
of
the
better
wheats
ive
ran
into
pours
hazy
golden
color
with
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
wonderful
cascade
hops
taste
is
hop
bitterness
not
much
more
doesnt
linger
in
finish
very
long
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
a
little
bite
from
carbonation
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
too
bad
it
cost
10
for
a
six
pack
or
i
would
drink
this
more
if
you
like
american
wheat
beers
and
hops
youll
like
this
a
good
summer
beer
but
nothing
too
special
this
wheat
beer
poured
out
a
nice
deep
golden
color
with
typical
wheat
haziness
gave
a
decent
light
head
but
it
did
not
stick
around
long
some
mild
lacing
produced
as
the
beer
went
down
nothing
really
stuck
out
in
the
smell
mild
citrus
and
wheat
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
noticed
a
good
deal
of
carbonation
at
that
point
beer
went
down
smooth
with
a
light
crisp
taste
again
with
just
mild
hints
of
citrus
and
wheat
if
you
gave
me
this
for
a
summer
night
i
wouldnt
complain
but
i
wouldnt
remember
you
in
the
morning
either
d
finishes
much
stronger
would
purchase
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
d
very
drinkable
beer
ive
seen
this
at
the
supermarket
many
times
but
always
pass
it
up
ill
be
sure
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
hand
from
now
on
nice
summer
beer
overall
a
pretty
decent
pale
wheat
ale
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
again
my
first
real
experience
with
a
wheat
beer
and
it
was
quite
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
and
wil
further
explore
this
style
guy
at
the
store
recommended
this
one
had
never
tried
it
so
i
was
game
flavors
on
this
one
are
subdued
not
much
hops
but
mild
wheatgrain
flavor
appearance
was
a
nice
cloudy
unfiltered
yellow
head
was
about
an
inch
with
some
lacing
smell
was
a
definate
yeast
but
you
taste
less
than
you
smell
had
a
fairly
thick
mouthfeel
but
was
rather
bland
was
hopeing
for
more
of
a
kick
at
the
end
no
kick
just
a
subdued
wheat
taste
overall
average
could
have
used
a
little
more
citris
whang
to
it
or
more
hopps
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
terribley
outstanding
would
be
pretty
good
with
some
foods
since
it
wouldnt
cover
up
the
flavor
of
the
dish
this
one
was
okay
but
fairly
hohum
for
the
most
part
nothing
bad
about
it
but
nothing
overwhelming
by
any
stretch
drinkable
but
not
memorable
extremely
cloudy
wheat
with
a
whiteyellow
hue
a
thin
bubbly
quickly
dissapating
head
smells
mild
mostly
of
yeast
and
surprising
clean
with
a
faint
but
focused
hop
aroma
taste
oh
this
is
definitely
not
a
witbier
which
is
what
i
was
anticipating
when
i
excitedly
and
hurriedly
saw
a
north
coast
wheat
beer
and
picked
it
up
as
part
of
a
mixasix
that
definitely
comes
into
play
here
as
i
dont
enjoy
most
other
wheat
beer
styles
taste
is
tangy
bitey
and
citrusy
not
sweet
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
though
with
too
much
carbonation
especially
for
a
wheat
beer
on
the
tounge
it
is
not
as
heavy
as
i
would
expect
it
to
be
this
is
light
years
better
than
magic
hats
circus
boy
for
certain
and
it
is
drinkable
if
you
like
this
style
i
think
it
would
be
an
fine
beer
to
stock
for
casual
drinking
keep
in
mind
that
nothing
legitimately
bad
comes
out
of
north
coast
but
all
around
this
one
seems
mostly
to
sing
average
your
mileage
may
vary
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
aroma
has
notes
of
citrusy
hops
sour
wheat
toasted
bread
and
yeast
appealing
and
light
the
flavor
starts
off
with
hoppy
citrus
notes
followed
by
toasted
bread
mild
cane
sugar
sweetness
yeast
and
a
wheaty
twang
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
a
very
nice
pale
wheat
ale
from
north
coast
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
lot
of
flavor
poured
a
smallish
head
with
no
retention
color
was
a
pale
yet
golden
sunshine
color
the
lacing
was
defiently
subpar
with
any
average
wheat
beer
smell
was
tart
and
a
little
metallic
the
flavor
was
a
tart
banana
and
wheat
melange
with
some
plae
malts
in
the
mix
but
all
these
flavors
were
pretty
muted
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
run
of
the
mill
as
far
as
wheat
beers
go
i
have
to
tell
you
i
like
this
one
its
got
a
full
body
for
a
wheat
nice
thick
mouthfeel
goes
down
smoothly
and
you
can
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
a
great
session
beer
moderately
priced
low
hops
strong
malt
and
wheat
an
unusually
terrific
smell
for
a
wheat
if
you
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
sessions
give
this
one
a
whirl
a
very
drinkable
american
wheat
a
style
i
generally
dont
care
for
if
brewers
go
overboard
on
hops
or
if
the
yeast
character
is
nonexistent
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
delicate
and
light
but
with
good
character
may
be
too
subtle
for
some
again
i
recommend
you
try
this
as
the
first
beer
of
the
day
not
after
anything
else
this
is
the
only
american
wheatnot
hefe
that
i
buy
with
any
regularlity
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
i
come
across
it
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
overall
a
damn
fine
wheat
beer
maybe
to
light
to
drink
on
a
cold
winter
evening
but
perfect
for
a
bbq
or
baseball
game
good
mouthfeel
not
heavy
not
watery
just
good
beer
i
usually
buy
a
few
of
these
to
keep
in
my
beer
fridge
nice
beer
satisfying
smooth
drinking
wheat
beer
just
nice
at
end
of
a
long
hot
day
good

grain
nice
sweet

some

mid
mouthfeel
not

big
beer
done
very
well
its
white
and
also
has
an
orange
hue
recommended
north
coast
is
impressive
with
their
offerings
this
is
a
highly
reccomended
beer
to
at
least
test
out
poured

cloudy
golden
orange
frothy
head
dissappated
almost
immediately
to
side
glass
lacing
smell
wasnt
very
strong
fruity
and
somewhat
yeasty
though
i
wasnt
impressed
by
the
appearance
or
smell
the
taste
was
great
very
sweet
and
biscuity
tasting
at
the
front
then
fruity
and
slightly
floral
hops
with
a
crisp
dry
slightly
tart
finish
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
malty
i
could
drink
this
one
over
and
over
loved
it
not
much
like
most
wheats
ive
had
but
very
good
mouth
feel
is
light
but
is
a
bit
oily
in
the
finish
easy
drinking
but
nothing
spectacular
finish
is
a
tad
dry
otherwise
a
decent
american

goes
down

not
too
bad
considering
its
1am
and
its
still

100

thirst
quencher

youve
ever
eaten

good
citrus

the
taste
dances
across
the
palate
with
a
bitter
and
sour
sting
this
beer
has
some
flavor
there
is
an
aftertaste
that
is
less
than
pleasant
yeasty

or
something
the

is
medium

close
the

are
faint

the

is
citrusy
at

followed
by
a

with

this
also
has
an
excellent
finishing
flavor
no
bad
aftertaste
whatsoever
the
drink
finishes
smooth

i
find
it
quite

do
find
it

no
noticiable

other
than
a
sour
note
at

just
zingy

lightly
wheaty
drinkable
i
dont
usually
enjoy
wheat
beer
i
typically
equate
them
to
drinking
a
breadstick
but
this
one
was
a
nice
surprise
it
had
all
the
elements
of
a
wheat
beer
but
they
were
all
relatively
tame
and
no
one
element
overpowered
the
others
specifically
you
could
taste
the
wheatiness
lemon
and
hops
but
they
were
very
manageable
there
was
a
mild
fruitiness
in
the
aroma
i
would
tell
hard
core
wheat
beer
drinkers
to
stay
away
everyone
else
should
give
it
a
try
imagine
your
favorite
hefeweizen
murky
goldenyellow
voluminous
head
enticing
to
the
eyes
now
take
away
all
the
bananaclove
scent
that
usually
tickles
the
fancy
of
your
nose
take
away
the
fruity
esters
that
make
your
palate
so
happy
and
you
have
this
beer
all
the
promise
of
a
hefe
missing
all
the
reasons
that
you
reach
for
it
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
buy
into
this
as
being
a
separate
style
as
in
american
wheat

really
very

but
not
anything
to

about
had
at

also
hella
foamy
one
of
my
standards
that
i
keep
around
just
a
good
beer
that
doesnt
disappoint
pretty
smooth
with
a
nice
aroma
tastes
like
a
classy
budweiser
this
wheat
ale
is
not
particularly
memorable
or
remarkable
in
any
way
its
actually
the
weakest
of
all
of
goose
islands
products
that
i
have
tried
so
far
not
to
say
its
bad
but
their
beers
are
usually
very
good
ok
whatever
beer
here
o
solid
beer
not
as
flavourful
as
say
gumball
head
for
what
it
is
its
a
solid
beer
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
decent
flavour
to
it
and
its
cheap
to
boot
hazy
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
like
wheat
malt
with
hints
of

but
the
scent
is
very
faint
very
mild
malt
taste
with
some
lemon
flavor
has
a
typical
wheat
beer
mouth
feel
overall
i
feel
like
this
beer
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
in
the
taste
department
i
feel
like
a
lemon
wedge
would
have
benefited
this
beer
a
great
deal
pours
a
slightly
dark
straw
color
interesting
aroma
a
blend
of
earthy
tones
and
some
malt
taste
is
wheaty
spicy
and
some
elements
of
mineral
water
an
easy
drinking
light
and
crisp
feel
not
a
bad
brew
but
a
tad
on
the
bland
side
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
hazy
tart
and
crisp
refreshing
wheat
ale
312
is
my
go
to
domestic
easy
drinking
light
and
pleasant
enough
just
not
a
lot
of
flavor
i
think
i
could
pound
these
all
night
no
problem
had
this
beer
for
sunday
lunch
on
tap
bar
louis
in
denver
i
enjoyed
it
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
this
is
average
in
every
sense
of
the
word
overall
if
i
was
blindtasting
this
id
be
able
to
guess
its
an
ab
product
its
probably
mindblowing
for
people
used
to
drinking
bud
light
but
ill
be
honest
i
almost
would
rather
drink
a
bud
light
because
its
easier
to
swallow
i
had
to
drain
pour
this
and
i
hate
drain
pouring
beers
meh
just
another
low
abv
bland
wheat
overall
and
to
be
honest
this
is
their
lowest
common
denominator
offering
this
is
not
meant
to
be
a
jab
but
rather
just
to
explain
how
this
is
clearly
their
beer
to
sway
craft
fringers
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
many
many
beer
drinkers
still
reach
for
bmc
the
thing
drinks
light
enough
like
one
and
the
flavor
profile
is
crisp
and
equally
as
comparable
you
get
just
a
little
more
sweetness
and
a
bit
more
of
that
savory
metallic
quality
from
the
wheat
actually
as
the
beer
warms
you
get
this
curious
zesty
lemon
flavoring
that
is
part
yeast
and
part
citric
inclusion
otherwise
you
shouldnt
expect
much
else
different
from
your
typical
american
adjunct
lager
despite
the
differently
labeled
style
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
o
not
the
best
american
wheat
ive
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
another
gateway
beer
offering
from
goose
island
my
friends
who
are
not
into
craft
beer
would
certainly
drink
this
my
go
to
beer
good
taste
after
living
in
germany
for
four
years
and
drinking
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
i
was
slightly
disappointed
in
this
one
i
guess
they
call
it
a
pale
american
wheat
beer
for
a
reason
it
just
didnt
have
the
strong
wheat
taste
ive
come
to
expect
in
a
wheat
beer
smooth
taste
for
a
wheat
ale
and
no
after
taste
very
flat
taste
from
the
the
very
touch
of
your
tongue
till
the
finish
just
flat
absolutely
delicious
light
wheat
beer
fruity
taste
yet
smooth
fun
beer
for
my
pallet
a
superb
choice
it
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
and
goes
well
with
many
different
meals
i
always
keep
a
few
in
my
fridge
for
after
class
i
consider
this
my
bud
light
replacement
as
my
taste
buds
matured
not
very
aromatic
but
a
nice
beer
for
bowling
i
would
drink
it
again
after
one
sip
this
beer
became
a
favorite
almost
like
a
less
in
your
face
witbier
doesnt
have
the
orangyness
like
a
bluemoon
but
definitely
a
nice
smooth
easy
to
drink
wheat
beer
would
love
to
try
again
its
a
very
good
american
wheat
ale
overall
honestly
its
better
than
i
expected
after
reading
the
other
reviews
when
it
comes
to
wheat
ive
only
had
this
and
blue
moon
and
prefer
this
over
blue
moon
this
beer
is
terrible
i
rather
get
iced
this
is
a
hazy
golden
beer
the
head
is
slim
and
soapy
smell
of
mild
wheat
a
hint
of
twang
and
some
yeast
grain
and
some
citrus
this
is
an
everyday
average
wheat
nothing
special
the
result
is
a
taste
i
would
only
accept
if
i
were
a
sixteen
year
old
desperate
to
get
drunk
the
taste
is
bold
enormous
and
overwhelming
just
like
city
lights
on
beer

the
flavor
is
as
light
as
the
feel
with
some
mild
maltiness
which
comes
off
as
slightly
wheat
in
the
sweet
quality
of
grain
with
some
mild
pilsner
toastiness
perhaps
with
some
mild

pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
the
nose
is
grassy
mild
and
light
wheat
flavor
that
lacks
the
funky
tartness
of
many
american
wheat
beers
there
just
a
touch
of
hoppiness
on
the
finish
as
wheat
beers
go
this
one
is
amazingly
ok
basically
it
is
a
very
light
lowalcohol
kinda
flavorless
wheat
beer
c
nuff
said
im
cool
with
this
its
not
much
but
sometimes
simple
is
good
a
decent
beer
the
nose
was
a
bit
onedimensional
but
the
taste
was
pleasant
with
some
light
hop
notes
coming
through
overall
i
would
say
average
at
best
there
are
better
northwest
wheats
around
and
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
to
buy
this
again
peace
i
dont
know
what
goose
island
was
thinking
here
but
a
lot
of
budweiser
is
sold
there
is
no
accounting
for
taste
o
did
i
mention
bland
yeah
its
completely
inoffensive
though
so
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
if
the
only
other
offerings
were
bmc
wait
a
minute
d
easy
to
drink
a
bit
sweet
and
not
really
remarkable
but
easy
to
drink
remember
if
you
drink
dont
drive
and
if
youre
gonna
drive
for
cryin
out
loud
please
dont
drink
stay
safe
overall
its
sluggable
but
it
has
so
little
flavour
i
wonder
whats
the
point
i
really
dont
want
to
say
that
theres
only
a
minimal
advantage
in
drinking
this
over
bud
but
i
guess
i
just
insinuated
that
anyway
lets
leave
it
at
that
easydrinking
beer
for
at
a
baseball
game
no
complaints
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
during
our
first
day
in
chicago
when
temperatures
hit
80
i
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
it
certainly
is
smooth
and
consistent
but
the
wheat
character
is
pretty
mild
and
almost
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
wheat
ale
and
a
blonde
easy
drinker
for
sure
not
overly
interesting
though
i
am
sure
they
were
appealing
to
the
easy
drinking
mass
market
o
average
not
too
exciting
i
hear
its
better
on
draft
sessionable
it
isnt
often
that
i
praise
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
with
that
in
mind
its
even
more
impressive
how
i
perceived
312
urban
wheat
this
is
a
definate
pickup
for
warmer
weather
overall
a
rather
refreshing
and
quite
nice
drinking
brew
it
has
a
nice
light
body
with
a
good
blend
of
grainy
wheat
and
light
grassy
and
citrus
flavors
to
make
for
a
good
session
brew
lively
crisp
and
refreshing
not
bad
at
all
a
summer
drink
though
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
like
fresh
grain
taste
begins
with
a
dry
cracker
flavor
then
some
more
grain
then
a
clean
zesty
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
though
a
bit
bland
for
unfiltered
the
beer
is
remarkably
clear
and
there
is
no
sediment
in
the
bottle
maybe
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
someone
who
is
used
to
light
lagers
overall
im
not
the
worlds
biggest
american
wheat
ale
fan
but
did
enjoy
i
will
drink
again
but
at
9
a
sixer
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
keep
it
in
the
fridge
expecting
more
flavor
from
an
unfiltered
wheat
i
would
prefer
this
brew
over
many
generic
offerings
out
there
but
given
the
many
options
available
that
go
well
above
and
beyond
in
the
wheat
category
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
overall
i
generally
recommend
this
beer
to
people
its
refreshing
and
nonoffensive
its
worth
a
try
i
like
this
in
the
summer
it
also
compliments
fish
and
white
meat
well

this
leaned

in

finished

glass
and
enjoyed
it
but
would
probably
not
buy
this
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
wheat
ale
again
i
do
hope
they
continue
to
put
out
good
product
without
compromising
during
the
process

i
couldnt

myself
having

of
these
at
a
time
but
a
decent
refreshing
beer
anyways
o
eh
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
o
i
would
love
to
sample
this
ale
just
after
produced
to
see
how
much
i
am
missing
by
drinking
an
older
one
make
sure
to
pay
attention
to
the
label
and
i
have
overlooked
as
the
sour
taste
really
took
away
from
the
enjoyment
of
this
beer
i
tried
to
rate
this
product
without
taking
that
into
consideration
as
i
do
not
want
to
hold
goose
island
responsible
notes
maybe
i
had
a
bad
bottle
maybe
my
taste
buds
were
off
from
the
big
indian
dinner
i
had
but
this
one
was
sour
and
not
enjoyable
my
first
bad
experience
with
a
goose
island
beer
i
am
going
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
doubt
and
will
try
again
and
revise
my
review
if
necessary
sorry
overall
a
decent
american
wheat
nothing
offputting
but
nothing
great
either
session
friendly
but
there
are
several
wheat
brews
i
can
think
of
that
id
rather
session
ive
gotta
say
id
be
lying
if
i
wasnt
excited
to
try
this
312
is
one
of
the
most
popular
crafts
in
the
northeast
and
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
try
it
yet
theres
gotta
be
some
reason
its
popular
it
pours
out
a
hazy
yellowgolden
color
with
a
head
that
retains
very
well
the
aroma
is
a
citrus
and
wheat
affair
with
a
light
touch
of
citrus
hoppiness
the
taste
is
very
nice
it
manages
to
do
a
smooth
wheat
and
citrus
thing
but
minus
the
graininess
that
often
accompanies
this
flavor
profile
i
like
grainy
flavors
dont
get
me
wrong
but
this
is
a
nice
switchup
that
really
makes
the
beer
seem
delicate
theres
also
a
nice
subtle
hop
character
that
adds
just
a
touch
of
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
spoton
this
beer
goes
down
way
too
easy
i
really
love
trying
a
regions
gateway
crafts
theyre
almost
always
very
wellmade
if
not
especially
to
the
average
bas
taste
312
is
a
solid
and
extremely
drinkable
wheat
i
think
well
make
good
friends
over
the
summer

nothing

some

at

some
more
complexity

some

benefit
from
subtlety
i
think
its

is
the
best
quality
about
it

are
difficult
to
detect

first
had
this
beer
on
tap
in
the
chicagoland
area
and
loved
it
its
a
simple
with
light
lemon

theyre
kind
of
weak
it
drinks
fine
with
light
carbonation
and
is
very
thing
and
easy
to
drink
i
know
this
is
goose

most
available
beer
but
it
tastes
a
little
too
much
like
a
mass
produced
what
that
said
not
your
typical
wheat
ale
overall

since
it
was
available
on

54444this
was
another
great
beer
from
goose
island
the
color
was
a
light
copper
color
with
a
little
haze
the
aroma
was
nice
and
yeasty
but
with
a
hop
backbone
the
flavor
was
hoppy
with
a
great
taste
of
yeast
i
could
put
back
a

dozen
of
these
on
a

its
just
as
youd
expect
lots
of
wheat
it
had
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
taste
other
than
that
it
was
enjoyable
i
also
tasted
a
few
fruity
notes
as
well
the
good
kind

please
taste
begins
pretty
pale
and
bland
grains
and
some
zesty
lemon
with
a
faint
wheat
backbone
the
flavor
seems
to
be
pretty
watered
down
overall
with
a
very
empty
aftertaste
fluffy
and
soft
feel
with
a
light
body
steady
carbonation
which
makes
this
fairly
refreshing
once
again
and
a
small
dry
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
mostly
bland

aftertone
heavy
wheat
cant
really
detect
the
hops
very
well
overall
especially
with
the
low
abv
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
one
can
drink
these
with
buddies
who
have
never
had
a
wheat
beer
and
theyd
be
none
the
wiser
a
session
beer
perhaps
good
for
card
games
light
easygoing
this
reminds
me
of
a
blonde
not
alot
going
on
upstairs
but
beautiful
to
look
at
nonetheless
this
was
a
light
beer
and
enjoyable
to
drink
probably
better
in
the
hot
days
of
summer
when
it
is
cool
and
you
are
warm
served
on
tap
minimal

clear
straw
color
smell
is

with
some

taste
is
the
same
very
lemony
some
spicyness
as
well
the
mouthfell
was
pretty
light
almost
watery
but
not
horrible
i
really
cant
beleive
how
fast
and
easy
this
went
down
overall
its
a
good
tasting
beer
nothing
special
a
little
light
in
body
but
would
make
a
good
session
beer
overall
just
too
watery
drinkability
i
wouldnt
rate
it
as
a
great
weisse
beer
nor
would
i
say
that
its
a
bad
one
i
just
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
any
but
if
someone
would
give
me
more
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
drinkability
as
far
as
wheat
beers
go
this
is
a
very
drinkable
one
i
drank
this
a
lot
this
summer
i
guess
you
could
call
it
a
nice
summer
session
beer
i
dont
think
ill
crave
it
in
the
colder
months
as
it
is
a
little
too
light
for
the
minnesota
winter
refreshing
has
some
substance
for
a
mass
produced
beer
and
is
turning
bmc
drinkers
into
almost
craft
drinkers
that
aint
bad
beer
is
mass
produced
and
cheap
but
for
your
buck
you
cant
do
much
better
at
the
local
big
chain
supermarket
ng
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
liquid
with
a
white
head
that
slowly
fell
leaving
a
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
fruity
lemon
and
banana
maybe
and
slightly
grassy
the
taste
was
similar
with
a
little
wheat
in
there
mouthfeel
was
fine
but
carbonation
was
light
sessionable
on
a
warm
afternoon
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
lingers
around
on
top
of
the
glass
smell
is
lemony
and
wheat
smells
some
spice
but
very
little
in
the
nose
taste
is
wheat
and
a
little
grains
some
light
spice
flavors
too
mostly
a
light
nice
wheat
beer
pours
from
the
bottle
to
a
copper
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
that
lingers
well
and
leaves
good
lacing
ont
he
glass
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
grassyfloral
hops
and
the
flavor
follows
suit
mouthfeel
is
nonexciting
probably
due
to
the
low
carbonation
this
leads
to
a
finish
that
is
at
first
satisfying
but
that
quickly
fades
to
stale
grass
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
a
couple
others
ive
had
from
this
little
startup
brewery
one
of
the
more
impressive
summerwheat
beers
ive
had
so
far
served
ontap
this
was
a
golden
mostly
clear
straw
in
color
i
really
could
not
pick
up
too
much
aromawise
maybe
some
lemony
and
bready
notes
taste
is
mostly
of
lemony
tartness
with
a
hint
of
sweet
wheaty
malt
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
good
i
almost
expected
this
to
be
watery
for
a
4
2
beer
but
it
wasnt
drinkability
is
good
considering
the
tart
crispness
and
light
body
of
this
beer
definitely
a
summer
beer
as
the
name
suggests
312
is
meant
to
be
light
and
refreshing
with
maximum
flavour
and
thats
what
it
is
the
low
abv
makes
it
a
perfect
summer
quencher
which
allows
it
to
be
sessionable
and
a
nice
match
for
summer
grilling
grub
i
liked
it
and
hopefully
it
will
be
a
summertime
staple
in
future
years
drinkability
a
nice
summer
quaffer
hazy
first
morning
piss
look
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
smell
was
a
bit
cellarish
at
first
then
pledgelemon
small
floaters
that
stayed
in
a
nice
tight
pattern
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
which
is
pretty
typical
for
this
style
taste
was
citrus
with
a
bit
of
wonderbread
and
kisses
of
spice
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
but
i
prefer
a
little
more
personality
forgettable
but
not
regrettable
nicely
done
wheat
beer
the
paleish
yellow
color
was
just
average
and
there
was
very
little
lacing
in
the
glass
this
was
spiced
just
right
to
produce
a
zesty
wheaty
and
citrusy
aroma
and
taste
that
was
very
refreshing
the
flavors
were
very
wellbalanced
this
is
an
ideal
summer
beer
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
almost
pissy
with
lots
of
tiny
suspended
particles
the
head
is
a
finger
or
so
and
the
lacing
is
minor
i
pick
up
a
distinct
honey
aroma
mixed
with
some
lemon
and
dank
well
water
the
taste
is
tart
wheaty
with
some
biscuit
it
is
pretty
thin
drinkable
enough
probably
a
refreshing
choice
in
general
some
cracker
citrus
noted
in
the
front
trying
this
right
after
an
iipa
was
probably
not
the
most
fair
condition
so
i
will
be
happy
to
sample
again
but
generally
this
isnt
my
favorite
variety
and
seems
a
bit
too
tart
to
rate
highly
on
my
list
this
is
an
easy
dinking
beer
something
i
can
give
to
everyone
to
enjoy
just
had
this
beer
again
just
wanted
to
say
this
beer
is
great
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
good
but
theres
nothing
special
about
this
beer
happening
a
good
utility
beer
for
the
summer
months
where
refreshment
is
as
high
of
a
priority
as
enjoyment
i
did
enjoy
the
fine
carbonation
to
this
beer
though
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
dissipates
quickly
into
lacing
nice
smell
of
wheat
and
citrus
the
taste
mostly
wheat
and
citrus
is
pleasing
decent
mouthfeel
not
crisp
not
watery
a
good
beer
that
is
a
little
light
but
a
good
fit
for
warmer
weather
d
yes
this
is
drinkable
like
a
chilled
lemonade
is
drinkable
low
alcohol
good
flavors
and
aroma
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
oomph
to
it
so
it
wasnt
so
weaklackluster
in
the
mouth
a
good
summer
beer
a
thirst
quencher
if
theres
such
a
thing
with
beers
but
ultimately
not
one
id
want
to
have
more
than
one
maybe
two
of
before
either
shutting
it
down
or
moving
on
drinkability
no
problems
but
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
either
sure
give
it
a
try
its
a
nice
safe
summertime
wheat
beer
but
ive
had
better
both
franziskaner
and
weihenstephaner
are
much
preferred
over
this
one
d
with
pizza
in
the
summer
this
would
be
pretty
good
i
think
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
312
urban
wheat
ale
was
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
didnt
last
long
but
did
leave
a
little
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
light
malt
with
a
little
lemon
the
taste
was
citric
with
some
wheat
malt
and
a
dry
finish
it
was
light
bodied
and
a
little
watery
drinkability
was
good
overall
its
just
another
boring
wheat
beer
drinkability
a
nice
summertime
beer
that
quenches
your
thirst
even
thought
there
is
a
bit
of
graininess
in
the
body
nice
beer
to
have
on
tap
minus
the
lemon
i
poured
this
bottled
beer
into
a
pint
glass
a
decent
white
froth
formed
with
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
but
did
not
last
very
long
the
beer
has
a
yellow
color
and
unexciting
smell
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
but
a
good
buy
for
the
price
poured
into
my
weizen
glass
the
ale
look
a
brilliant
hazy
yellow
definitely
some
particulate
moderate
carbonation
drifts
up
to
a
nice
thick
cap
not
much
retention
and
little
lace
scent
is
grains
and
some
citrus
hops
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
the
wheat
and
citrus
mostly
lemon
and
orange
the
hops
are
noted
as
well
a
very
dry
crisp
finish
rounds
this
beer
off
nicely
goose
island
scores
again
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
slightly
cloudy
light
straw
color
with
a
sudsy
white
head
smell
is
clean
and
is
of
wheat
and
citrusy
hops
taste
has
a
bit
of
wheat
and
lemon
a
decently
refreshing
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
minimal
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
fairly
quaffable
i
always
enjoy
gis
offerings
this
one
is
no
exception
pours
a
clear
light
golden
with
a
decent
head
and
pretty
good
lacing
the
smell
is
somewhat
light
but
whats
there
is
mostly
light
yeast
and
bananas
the
taste
is
also
quite
light
with
some
grainy
wheat
light
banana
and
a
little
lemon
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
as
crisp
as
it
could
be
veering
toward
the
slick
instead
a
decent
summer
brew
if
a
little
forgettable
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
has
a
warm
sunlight
quality
to
it
the
head
starts
out
large
and
airy
then
quickly
collapses
to
a
spotty
sheet
the
beer
struggles
to
maintain
little
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
starts
with
a
very
noticeable
lemon
bread
aroma
also
detectable
are
grapefruit
and
malt
overall
the
nose
is
mild
but
pleasing
taste
has
a
lemon
zing
up
front
followed
by
slightly
bready
malt
and
wheat
sweetness
a
dash
of
grapefruit
is
thrown
in
for
good
measure
lemon
is
a
bit
too
prominent
on
the
palate
finish
is
citrusy
and
dry
body
is
medium
light
with
a
good
carbonation
that
gives
the
beer
a
smooth
feel
carbonation
doesnt
seem
quite
as
crisp
as
it
should
be
thirst
quenching
and
drinkable
what
ya
get
here
is
a
lightly
carbonated
and
very
clean
almost
too
clean
tasting
beer
with
hot
day
summertime
drinking
in
mind
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
in
on
the
tastebuds
with
a
slight
bready
aftertaste
not
much
when
it
comes
to
tasting
the
hops
yeast
seems
to
take
the
lead
not
even
close
to
be
an
exciting
beer
or
something
i
imagine
i
would
recommend
to
anything
but
a
novice
wanting
to
try
one
of
them
fancy
beers
312
has
enough
character
to
show
the
drinker
of
average
domestics
a
bit
of
zing
but
still
gatewaybland
enough
not
to
make
them
run
back
to
their
watery
security
blanket
that
comes
in
can
and
a
big
let
down
compared
to
other
goose
island
things
i
have
tried
definitely
a
beer
for
the
summer
a
bit
to
watery
in
my
opinion
to
rank
with
my
favorite
summer
wheats
but
a
good
beer
as
it
is
light
clean
mouth
feel
great
beer
for
summer
days
very
drinkable
drinkability
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
especially
on
hot
days
but
nothing
here
really
excites
me
like
most
offerings
from
goose
island
this
brew
despite
it
being
very
light
in
taste
is
actually
very
drinkable
what
comes
to
mind
for
this
beer
is
if
a
typical
macro
lager
were
to
become
an
ale
this
is
kind
of
how
i
would
imagine
it
tasting
very
light
on
taste
easy
to
drink
low
bitterness
this
brew
is
good
choice
for
the
warm
summer
months
as
a
refresher
but
there
just
isnt
enough
to
this
brew
to
recommend
it
for
year
round
enjoyment
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
another
not
an
earthshaking
beer
but
definatley
a
great
summer
option
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
thirst
quenching
overall
kind
of
a
waste
there
arent
really
any
flavors
to
speak
of
super
thin
and
not
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
finishes
somewhat
dry
this
brew
also
has
a
super
light
body
with
higher
levels
of
carbonationokay
these
are
appropriate
for
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
goes
down
like
cold
water
in
a
hot
desert
i
will
not
be
buying
this
brew
again
there
are
much
better
out
there
one
wordoberon
pours
a
piss
yellow
the
kind
after
a
long
night
of
drinking
smells
sweet
and
grainy
closer
to
a
pilsner
than
a
wheat
beer
an
inch
head
that
faded
away
quickly
tastes
of
the
hops
initially
for
a
second
and
then
sweet
grainswheat
slight
citrus
hoppy
finish
almost
tasted
like
a
very
weak
pale
ale
at
first
light
bodied
goes
down
like
water
i
picked
it
up
at
kroger
for
5
95
so
it
certainly
would
be
worth
it
over
some
other
beers
for
mass
consumption
on
a
hot
summers
day
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
if
i
wanted
to
enjoy
just
a
few
very
good
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
good
flavor
and
a
good
feel
in
the
mouth
i
recommend
it
because
it
is
much
better
than
most
beer
in
its
class
i
also
thought
the
taste
was
crisp
and
refreshing
without
any
bitterness
that
would
have
damaged
the
overall
taste
relatively
low
alcohol
content
s
mouthfeel
is
light
somewhat
refreshing
beer
but
a
tad
bit
sugary
for
my
taste
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pale
yellow
color
that
has
a
tiny
amount
of
head
with
some
fairly
decent
lacing
some
visibly
strong
carbonation
smell
is
dominated
by
lemon
with
a
faint
breadlike
sweetness
in
the
background
the
taste
is
nice
at
first
with
some
strong
lemon
character
but
then
there
is
an
awful
artificial
sweetener
taste
on
the
back
end
im
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
but
man
its
rough
mouthfeel
is
fine
carbonation
is
refreshing
but
ive
had
better
version
of
this
style
this
would
be
drinkable
if
that
odd
sweet
flavor
wasnt
there
recommendation
to
try
if
you
like
the
style
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
but
its
a
very
light
drinkable
beer
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
outdoors
on
a
summer
day
it
is
as
easy
to
drink
and
as
refreshing
as
water
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
so
light
that
you
forget
youre
drinking
beer
poured
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
small
bright
white
head
this
beer
was
poured
way
too
cold
so
at
first
there
was
little
flavor
and
i
was
dissapointed
until
it
warmed
some
the
scent
was
very
much
earthy
and
slightly
spicy
taste
was
a
lemon
zing
and
slightly
grassy
was
a
good
beer
overall
drinkability
it
isnt
as
easy
to
drink
as
one
would
expect
it
is
good
but
not
amazing
d
pretty
good
hope
i
can
find
this
come
the
warmer
months
of
july
and
august
but
you
go
just
perfect
with
a
slice
of
lou
malnatis
stuffed
pizza
so
i
just
cant
hate
you
drinkability
i
had
to
give
it
a
4
because
it
disappeared
way
too
quick
did
the
goose
island
goose
drink
it
down
while
i
wasnt
looking
nope
it
was
all
me
it
was
so
light
with
some
flavor
in
it
that
it
was
hard
to
put
down
even
though
i
was
drinking
this
in
the
middle
of
winter
it
was
still
quite
refreshing
if
its
this
refreshing
in
the
winter
time
i
would
like
to
see
what
its
like
in
the
summer
time
d
very
drinkable
beer
theres
something
missing
here
though
theres
a
lot
more
wheats
out
there
that
i
would
drink
before
this
one
i
take
back
what
i
said
earlier
this
beer
is
horrible
enough
that
i
will
refuse
to
drink
it
again
but
only
if
there
is
not
a
better
option
the
chances
of
that
is
zero
however
as
any
bar
that
would
stock
this
would
definitely
have
something
better
honkers
for
instance
d
a
very
good
am
pale
wheat
ale
a
great
combo
of
wheat
and
fruit
tastes
a
trade
from
jhammerly
pours
a
cloudy
yellowish
color
nice
carbonation
head
quickly
disappates
basically
no
lacing
afterwards
scents
of
malts
hops
wheat
yeast
and
some
citrus
the
taste
is
grassy
like
with
a
dry
finish
lightmedium
body
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
would
make
an
excellent
summer
time
session
brew
has
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
little
head
smells
fruity
orange
and
lemon
mostly
come
through
it
has
a
very
light
taste
some
spice
is
noticeable
is
also
high
in
carbonation
not
impressed
with
this
one
from
goose
island
they
definitely
have
better
offerings
i
dont
plan
on
having
this
again
honkers
ale
and
the
christmas
beer
from
goose
island
are
much
much
better
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
boring
beer
but
i
would
drink
it
in
a
world
of
macros
i
would
expect
more
from
goose
island
d
boring
beer
but
this
is
an
american
wheat
after
all
probably
would
be
better
with
a
lemon
wedge
cloudy
yellow
hard
to
get
a
decent
head
but
i
wont
hold
that
against
it
so
much
the
taste
is
a
smooth
at
first
and
then
it
is
followed
by
a
burst
of
hops
at
least
i
think
i
know
what
hops
is
now
in
the
end
i
would
love
to
drink
again
cheers
overall
this
is
a
mellow
beer
not
too
harsh
or
extravagant
in
any
direction
i
can
see
people
liking
this
if
theyre
taking
a
break
from
their
macro
beers
as
was
i
long
ago
with
spotted
cow
i
think
more
experienced
palettes
can
find
better
wheat
brews
out
there
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
i
was
not
overly
impressed
i
compare
this
wheat
beer
to
my
favorite
hacker
pschorr
weiss
by
comparison
the
taste
was
weak
there
was
a
citrus
taste
to
it
which
was
refreshing
but
i
like
a
stronger
beer
on
its
own
it
was
alright
but
i
would
not
buy
it
again
refreshing
and
light
bodied
this
one
is
lemony
and
quite
highly
hopped
this
is
an
interesting
blend
of
a
wheat
beer
and
a
pale
ale
that
is
worth
trying
i
would
like
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
next
summer
for
sessioning
medium
bodied
very
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
overall
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
large
head
that
quickly
disapates
leaving
decent
lacing
nose
is
light
bready
with
a
very
thin
fruity
component
flavor
is
watered
down
somewhat
skunky
apple
juice
its
not
undrinkable
just
not
something
to
be
seeking
out
thanks
to
jeffkrenner
for
the
bottle
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
decent
as
well
not
too
carbonated
but
not
a
lot
of
body
ive
had
nonbeer
friends
recommend
this
to
me
to
them
its
a
flavorful
change
of
pace
to
me
its
pretty
crappy
still
its
a
good
hot
day
slammin
brew
with
a
thick
body
that
makes
it
go
down
smooth
as
silk
so
if
you
are
going
to
a
chicago
street
fest
sneak
something
in
a
baby
stroller
low
abv
is
nice
for
the
style
not
simple
in
a
boring
way
just
in
a
pleasant
and
i
get
it
its
good
way
normally
pricey
but
under
a
buck
a
bottle
i
can
drink
these
all
day
on
a
sunny
afternoon
drinkabilityoverall
a
fairly
standard
apwa
sour
wheat
and
lemon
been
there
inoffensive
yet
entirely
unremarkable
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
it
does
have
a
certain
drinkability
drinkability
very
drinkable
highly
consumable
beer
with
its
crisp
refreshing
qualities
and
low
alcohol
content
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
just
dont
expect
anything
to
wow
you
with
this
one
though
light
and
refreshing
not
complex
at
all
very
simple
nothing
special
frankly
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
i
was
disappointed
in
the
basic
almost
macrobrew
nature
of
the
beer
nothing
wrong
here
just
nothing
over
whelmingly
attractive
either
good
standard
am
style
wheat
to
beat
the
heat
notes
perfect
summer
beer
pairs
well
with
fruit
salad
pasta
prima
vera
or
a
light
marinara
sauce
had
this
one
on
tap
whilst
in
chicago
presents
itself
as
a
mirky
yellow
color
with
a
super
huge
white
head
nose
is
of
citrus
and
floral
notes
slight
spiciness
as
well
palate
is
lively
somewhat
dry
and
only
a
subtle
wheat
taste
upfront
the
citrus
and
floral
notes
play
well
in
the
mouth
wheres
the
wheat
though
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
decnt
carbonation
but
tends
to
flatten
quickly
as
it
warms
this
does
wake
up
the
wheat
in
this
beer
however
okay
for
an
american
wheat
beer
readily
available
and
userfriendly
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
would
be
a
waste
of
time
and
energy
dont
bother
with
this
one
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
tumbler
the
appearance
was
light
and
hazy
yellow
with
a
wispy
head
the
aroma
was
really
faint
wheat
nothing
stood
out
very
strong
same
with
the
flavor
really
a
little
taste
of
wheat
base
and
a
tought
of
hops
bitterness
not
bad
but
kind
of
bland
this
brew
pours
a
clear
pale
yellowishorange
color
the
head
is
large
enough
but
fades
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
bubble
gum
with
a
mild
wheat
tanginess
if
you
look
really
hard
for
it
the
taste
is
even
more
faint
than
the
aroma
with
nothing
really
to
speak
of
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
thinnest
of
any
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
had
overall
like
so
many
other
american
wheat
beers
is
a
drain
pour
312
is
a
beer
that
pours
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
the
breadlike
aroma
of
wheat
is
fairly
obvious
while
the
flavor
of
this
slightly
hazy
yelllow
ale
is
inoffensively
like
a
liquid
low
salt
whean
thin
a
very
slight
tart
finish
adds
just
a
little
bit
of
compexity
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
definitely
fits
into
the
category
of
lawnmower
beer
in
that
respect
drinkability
i
will
admit
its
quite
quaffable
and
i
seem
to
recall
knocking
back
4
dollar
glasses
all
day
long
in
the
summer
sun
so
at
least
it
has
a
purpose
pours
a
cloudy
straw
with
the
yeast
pour
fizzy
three
finger
head
shows
poor
retention
but
good
lacing
powdery
yeast
and
wheat
nose
pretty
clean
first
sip
is
sweet
flaked
wheat
malt
and
a
spicy
clove
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
a
healthy
yeast
bite
low
carbonation
in
a
thin
body
results
in
a
very
quaffable
mouthfeel
but
the
drinkability
suffers
due
to
mild
astringent
charcter
that
comes
on
in
the
finish
much
better
head
good
lacing
lemony
notes
throughout
clean
finishing
a
bit
thin
sokay
but
not
what
pres
shoulda
sent
the
epm
not
bad
but
the
beer
is
pretty
mild
and
lacks
anything
mentionable
its
unoffending
but
not
spectacular
might
be
used
as
a
gateway
beer
for
someone
used
to
typical
massproducedmassmarketed
american
beer
cloudy
sun
yellow
body
with
particulates
suspended
in
the
media
aroma
is
very
tangy
and
citrusy
and
lemony
this
beer
is
lifeless
and
i
thought
the
island
wheat
from
capital
i
just
had
was
bland
carbonation
is
slightly
prickly
body
is
barely
medium
and
the
flavor
in
indescribable
not
a
lot
to
talk
about
a
little
of
that
lemon
and
citrus
tang
not
a
lot
else
watery
a
disappointment
i
liked
this
one
its
not
a
great
beer
but
its
enjoyable
as
far
as
american
wheats
go
goose
island
are
consistently
very
good
and
this
doesnt
disappoint
even
though
the
style
generally
does
id
drink
it
again
review
found
in
old
notes
not
sure
what
date
reviewed
but
sometime
this
last
winter
drinkablity
this
goes
down
easy
is
very
light
so
would
be
good
in
warm
weather
for
those
with
less
bold
tastes
but
not
so
much
for
me
i
am
sure
this
would
taste
great
on
draugh
but
in
the
bottle
is
lacking
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
the
carbonation
gives
the
beer
a
big
lift
in
the
mouthfeel
a
very
nice
well
balanced
beer
this
beer
is
highly
quaffable
and
very
sessionable
i
am
a
big
fan
of
goose
island
i
can
always
count
on
them
to
give
me
something
that
is
better
than
most
of
the
competition
for
a
great
price
and
they
are
always
dead
on
the
style
the
312
may
be
in
a
relatively
broad
category
but
it
neither
pins
it
down
or
pushes
the
boundaries
it
just
sort
of
sits
there
limply
they
and
you
can
do
better
312
is
a
great
looking
beer
ough
what
does
urban
mean
ill
give
it
another
shot
but
im
not
impressed
yet
dglad
i
tried
this
one
a
solid
wheat
ale
that
will
be
great
for
the
summer
months
another
good
selection
for
after
yard
work
im
revisiting
this
one
after
not
having
one
for
probably
a
year
or
so
goes
great
with
mexican
food
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
great
balance
of
flavor
and
drinkability
if
this
is
available
in
your
area
i
highly
recommend
it
rock
on
man
rock
on
a
decent
pale
wheat
brew
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
many
a
glass
full
drinkability
beats
a
macro
any
day
but
i
would
generally
choose
to
wait
for
a
real
german
wheat
beer
if
i
knew
that
the
opportunity
to
drink
one
would
soon
present
itself
drinkability
very
drinkable
due
to
the
light
body
and
clean
taste
this
would
make
a
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
in
a
hot
summer
need
some
cheddar
cheese
crackers
to
go
with
them
final
self
note
not
worth
the
8
for
a
sixer
price
an
excellent
american
wheat
not
complex
but
a
good
refreshing
beer
drinkability
quite
drinkable
could
be
a
session
beer
nothing
complex
but
nothing
bad
even
for
the
style
312
could
use
a
little
more
kick
yet
by
the
light
of
its
balanced
taste
and
the
approachability
of
the
next
sipbottle
it
stands
as
an
easy
pour
a
lock
as
an
intro
beer
for
a
macro
drinker
very
approachable
in
july
on
tap
at
the
clyborne
brew
pub
pale
clear
yellow
color
with
a
wispy
thin
head
watery
mouthfeel
has
a
weak
grainy
slightly
tart
malt
taste
fizzy
carbonation
weak
stale
bread
smell
a
little
better
than
your
average
macro
is
the
best
i
can
say
here
price
1
00
12oz
bottle
my
first
beer
from
the
goose
island
brewery
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
selections
there
was
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
it
was
just
bland
and
boring
it
was
drinkable
but
so
is
water
where
i
generally
enjoy
the
fuller
flavor
of
authentic
hefeweizens
i
can
see
this
crisper
cleaner
and
more
simplified
palate
finding
way
into
my
glass
while
enjoying
a
game
at
wrigley
field
12
ounce
bottle
pours
out
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
suspended
particles
and
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tangy
wheat
lemon
honey
and
cereal
grain
grain
flavor
with
lemons
wheat
flavor
but
not
at
all
hefe
weizen
like
maybe
it
could
use
some
more
hop
flavor
but
its
fine
the
way
it
is
medium
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
this
is
a
simple
beer
but
it
is
tasty
and
quaffable
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
foamy
head
actually
leaves
nice
patterns
of
lacing
on
the
pint
glass
citrusy
aroma
and
lingering
hops
soft
dry
mouthfeel
with
typical
wheat
qualities
the
wheat
character
gives
this
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
while
having
a
fairly
light
body
it
is
a
solid
offering
from
goose
island
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
fallback
as
its
served
ontap
at
many
places
in
my
area
drinkability
id
say
skip
it
there
are
many
more
better
crisper
and
refreshing
pale
wheat
ales
out
there
i
owed
it
to
the
brewers
to
give
this
a
second
review
this
is
certainly
drinkable
and
largely
inoffensive
just
so
long
as
you
shut
your
brain
off
prior
to
the
first
sip
in
some
aspects
312
urban
wheat
seems
to
have
been
created
for
the
masses
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
but
it
seems
to
lack
any
real
flavor
characteristics
it
reminds
me
a
lot
although
the
style
is
different
to
beers
such
as
new
glarus
spotted
cow
and
lakefronts
cattail
ale
the
later
being
a
more
recent
example
of
a
beer
catered
to
appeal
to
those
who
normally
drink
bland
american
lagers
again
this
doesnt
take
anything
away
from
the
beer
i
just
seem
to
get
the
sense
that
goose
island
was
trying
to
create
a
summer
entry
or
lawnmower
beer
for
someone
who
typically
would
enjoy
a
bmc
product
and
if
thats
what
turns
a
person
like
that
on
to
better
beer
than
so
be
it
im
sure
that
wasnt
their
intention
when
crafting
this
but
they
may
have
hit
that
market
in
the
process
if
that
silly
distributor
would
have
let
me
pick
this
up
in
a
6pack
i
surely
would
have
gone
through
plenty
over
the
summer
in
case
anyone
is
interested
312
refers
to
the
telephone
area
code
for
the
goose
island
brewery
it
seems
to
me
the
folks
at
gi
have
achieved
what
they
set
out
to
achieve
with
this
beer
that
is
to
give
an
often
lackluster
style
a
kick
in
the
ass
with
cascade
hops
and
to
give
the
lawnmower
beer
category
a
quality
newcomer
mission
accomplished
on
both
counts
pours
the
usual
yellow
colour
of
a
wheat
which
almost
matches
the
label
only
a
slight
haziness
in
the
glass
definitly
a
strong
wheat
flavour
and
aroma
with
a
slight
lemony
finish
fairly
thin
mouthfeel
and
relatively
low
carbonation
a
decent
wheat
but
rather
bland
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
perhaps
as
the
first
beer
after
coming
in
from
the
heat
before
moving
on
straw
yellow
with
a
slight
haziness
and
a
rocky
bright
white
head
lemon
citrus
and
wheat
dominate
the
aroma
and
flavour
along
with
a
bit
of
hop
character
subdued
bitterness
with
some
malty
sweetness
as
well
short
balanced
finish
with
some
dryness
creamy
texture
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
lightish
body
nice
flavour
light
and
drinkable
great
for
the
heat
of
summer
thanks
viggo
this
is
worth
experiencing
if
it
is
available
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
nor
would
i
pay
a
premium
price
for
it
dry
lemon
wheat
bread
flavor
a
bit
light
but
very
refreshing
very
refreshing
a
good
wheat
beer
and
not
overpowering
with
the
carbination
which
i
feel
it
has
just
the
right
amount
it
almost
goes
down
like
a
light
beer
easy
and
refreshing
but
has
the
richness
of
a
medium
bodied
beer
pale

that
of

here
light

good

more

might
do
this
some

maybe
orange
peel
not
bad
has
a
fruity
taste
up
front
with
some
hops
and
a
little
bitterness
kind
of
a
lemony
zest
there
too
without
being
sour
very
pleasant
beer
low
carbonation
and
very
refreshing
in
the
summer
good
for
sessioning
thanks
to
darkover
for
the
trade
apparently
wheat
doesnt
grow
too
well
in
urban
areas
hazy
yellowgold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
scant
lacing
the
aroma
is
faintly
wheaty
with
a
touch
of
malt
lightbodied
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
tastes
like
a
cross
between
a
wheat
and
an
adjunct
lager
mild
wheat
hops
and
corn
are
the
prevalent
flavors
the
finish
is
crisp
and
lightly
hoppy
and
fruity
not
bad
really
it
just
doesnt
need
to
be
this
bland
drinkability
i
drank
it
with
no
problem
and
it
wasnt
intolerable
so
average
but
there
are
otherbetter
wheats
out
there
tasty
simple
drinkable
i
like
this
beer
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
the
three
and
then
six
bottles
i
acquired
as
part
of
the
summer
samplers
will
find
a
good
home
first
in
the
dbf
and
then
my
belly
purchased
in
omaha
decent
need
not
avoid
cloudy
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
huge
white
frothy
and
sticky
head
that
stays
around
for
awhile
this
has
citrus
and
wheat
aromas
light
wheaty
and
some
lemon
flavor
medium
in
body
nice
soft
and
creamy
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
clean
and
refreshing
finish
a
bit
on
the
bland
side
dthis
is
an
average
beer
none
of
the
flavors
really
tell
you
its
a
wheat
beer
but
they
hops
and
grain
are
balanced
flavors
its
nice
for
someone
who
wants
to
switch
from
american
adjunct
lagers
but
im
rather
bored
after
drinking
it
i
had
it
on
cask
a
few
years
ago
and
really
liked
it
but
in
the
bottle
its
dead
not
impressed
with
you
at
all
watery
beer
this
brew
is
a
somewhat
hazy
lighter
goldstraw
color
small
white
head
at
the
crown
light
wheat
brew
smell
not
much
going
on
i
got
a
cold
take
the
grain
of
salt
light
malt
front
fairly
sweet
light
floral
hop
presence
wheaty
characteristics
not
as
intense
as
a
hefe
quite
refreshing
and
quaffable
while
i
would
prefer
a
hefe
to
this
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
could
drink
by
the
pool
by
the
case
excellent
refreshing
summer
brew
this
is
the
first
bottled
goose
island
to
let
me
down
poured
a
beautiful
hazy
gold
initial
flavor
is
a
lemony
citric
tartness
nothing
of
much
consequence
follows
up
on
the
citric
front
sort
of
a
case
of
waiting
for
the
other
shoe
to
drop
and
it
never
does
finish
is
a
neutral
astringency
yeast
appears
to
contribute
nothing
much
but
cloudyness
normally
id
assign
a
tart
reserved
wheat
such
as
this
to
the
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
category
but
this
falls
short
of
delivering
that
sort
of
refreshment
just
too
shallow
in
the
flavor
profile
to
make
me
want
another
12
oz
bottle
from
the
brewerys
summer
sampler
box
served
into
a
tall
weizen
glass
the
body
is
a
hazed
lemonade
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
good
patchy
lace
aroma
is
subdued
with
citrusy
lemon
grainy
wheat
and
a
hint
of
noble
hops
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
bodied
with
spritzy
carbonation
taste
is
lemon
zest
grainy
wheat
mild
coriander
and
white
pepper
spices
and
some
restrained
grassy
and
herbal
hopping
clean
and
crisp
this
is
a
laid
back
easy
going
beer
that
is
user
friendly
excellent
drinkability
i
had
this
at
charlies
ale
house
in
munster
indiana
for
2
50pint
nice
deal
and
a
good
starter
imo
this
beer
has
a
golden
glow
to
it
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
holds
well
lacing
is
moderate
a
few
bubbles
show
themselves
in
the
transparent
bronze
body
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
to
me
as
most
wheats
have
a
weak
aroma
but
i
notice
a
clean
pale
malt
flavor
and
some
bready
notes
but
not
much
flavor
is
just
a
nice
clean
wheat
backed
by
a
solid
hop
bitterness
to
even
out
the
sweetness
yeast
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
low
side
but
it
provides
a
drying
effect
good
lively
body
really
helps
this
beer
in
drinkability
and
the
finish
is
nice
and
crisp
nothing
spectacular
but
definitely
a
nice
drinker
and
a
beer
that
one
could
have
quite
a
few
of
no
prob
sampled
on
tap
last
night
at
jet
on
milwaukee
ave
in
chicago
served
in
a
tall
312
glass
and
had
a
cloudy
gold
appearance
looked
like
a
german
hefeweizen
smell
was
fruity
with
banana
esters
quite
nice
tasted
vanilla
banana
and
some
american
hop
bitterness
dont
recall
much
clove
or
spiciness
but
overall
very
quaffable
mouthfeel
was
about
right
sorta
thin
like
most
goose
island
brews
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
more
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
i
will
definitely
pick
up
more
of
this
during
the
summer
thanks
to
orbitalr0x
for
bringing
this
one
down
to
me
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
subdued
for
an
american
wheat
slight
hops
slight
spices
but
very
subdued
the
flavor
doesnt
have
as
much
of
the
us
hops
as
i
expected
it
to
which
i
like
it
still
has
a
slight
hoppiness
which
differentiates
it
from
the
standard
wheat
beers
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
that
ive
had
actually
thanks
to
orbitalr0x
for
bringing
this
to
me
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
nice
with
a
slight
citrusy
lemon
and
sweet
honey
hiding
behind
the
minimally
harsh
wheat
and
moderately
aggressive
noble
hop
i
like
it
the
flavor
is
full
on
the
spicey
noble
hop
followed
by
a
slight
lemoney
burst
finishing
true
to
its
roots
as
an
american
wheat
with
a
wheaty
graineyness
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
full
carbnation
outside
of
the
gumballhead
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
wheat
beers
i
have
had
very
good
show
a
good
looking
wheat
beer
that
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
a
fair
amount
of
cloud
a
nice
snow
white
two
finger
head
sits
on
top
that
offers
a
good
amount
of
lace
as
the
carbonation
purks
up
the
citric
aroma
the
taste
is
of
wheat
with
a
nice
amount
of
lemon
zest
a
tartness
is
felt
through
the
crisp
hops
while
a
nice
solid
malt
hints
the
background
of
this
medium
bodied
brew
the
carbonation
softens
the
mouthfeel
which
aids
its
drinkability
a
great
warm
wheather
beer
im
sure
if
you
can
get
it
try
it
a
good
drinkable
offering
of
this
style
drinkability
is
pretty
solid
on
this
one
definitly
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
i
have
had
will
be
a
great
session
beer
on
hot
summer
days
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
wave
of
small
bubbly
carbonation
that
fills
the
mouth
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
would
make
a
great
summer
session
brew
i
could
see
myself
having
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
sunny
day
working
in
the
yard
definetly
worth
a
try
hazy
yellow
with
some
tiny
sediment
and
loose
bubbly
carbonation
great
white
capped
head
that
offers
bananas
freshly
peeled
oranges
wheat
bread
and
some
oats
tarty
and
soursweet
a
sharp
offering
of
lemon
peel
coriander
and
some
wheat
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
strong
bitter
hops
kisses
of
black
pepper
on
the
palate
decent
maltbased
undertone
pretty
easy
drinkin
here
nothing
wrong
with
this
offering
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
pillowy
white
head
that
diminishes
greatly
but
sticks
around
until
the
end
the
nose
is
the
greatest
part
of
this
beer
toasted
cereal
bready
a
hint
of
banana
and
an
uderlying
citric
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
as
the
nose
but
less
intense
wheaty
and
grassy
slightly
fruity
with
a
little
bitter
hop
finish
lightly
carbonated
and
very
clean
this
should
make
for
a
great
session
beer
especially
in
the
summer
easy
drinking
summer
type
beer
with
excellent
carbonation
per
style
very
enjoyable
beer
bottled
and
draft
at
the
brewery
the
next
beer
in
their
specialty
retail
line
as
soon
as
they
get
approval
for
the
labels
baseline
example
of
an
american
wheat
pale
yellow
beer
under
a
bubbly
head
that
clings
a
little
to
the
plastic
glass
not
as
fizzy
as
other
wheats
hop
taste
is
more
traditionally
bitter
not
fruity
like
3fs
gumballhead
and
very
well
balanced
to
the
malt
profile
sampling
from
the
bottle
reveals
a
slightly
fruitier
profile
the
honey
didnt
do
anything
for
me
not
as
bready
and
wheaty
as
i
would
like
but
decent
taste
an
ok
beer
in
a
field
of
a
whole
bunch
of
other
ok
beers
feel
very
refreshing
lightmedium
bodied
very
easy
to
drink
perfect
beer
for
springsummer
while
a
fun
beer
it
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
the
honey
is
much
more
prominent
and
the
wheat
taste
as
well
as
the
fruit
and
spice
tastes
that
i
expected
are
hidden
yellowgolden
in
flavor
clear
with
a
slight
head
limited
retention
minimal
lacing
sweet
bready
aroma
with
some
honey
in
there
and
some
spice
that
i
cannot
make
out
pretty
good
flavor
was
expecting
even
more
sweetness
from
the
smell
but
still
pretty
sweet
not
as
much
wheat
as
i
expected
the
honey
is
there
along
with
what
seems
like
cinnamon
and
even
some
vanilla
really
clean
taste
good
carbonation
on
the
tongue
when
drinking
and
the
malts
has
me
licking
my
lips
between
sips
which
is
great
overall
a
pretty
good
sweet
wheat
beer
i
like
the
honey
chamomile
aftertaste
hard
to
get
wolavers
in
philly
area
the
variety
pack
with
the
wildflower
brown
ale
oatmeal
stout
is
awesome
one
of
my
favorite
beers
unfortunately
i
cant
find
it
in
the
cleveland
area
anymore
i
really
like
this
slightly
sweet
light
summer
beer
nice
cloudy
golden
color
lacking
a
good
head
though
very
smooth
golden
poor
with
decent
head
retention
the
taste
was
smooth
with
a
background
of
honey
the
honey
was
not
over
powering
but
a
fine
back
addition
easily
one
of
my
favorite
summer
brews
yet
poured
a
cloudy
gold
body
with
decent
head
that
dies
slow
with
some
patches
aroma
has
a
sweet
malt
vibe
to
it
more
than
minor
yeast
or
wheat
notes
along
with
subtle
spices
smooth
light
easy
this
beer
has
a
sweetness
to
it
not
normally
found
in
this
style
of
beer
reminds
of
something
sugary
and
bready
like
sugar
coated
pie
crust
not
a
bad
beer
but
once
you
get
past
the
sweetness
there
isnt
much
to
it
overall
very
tasty
for
such
a
light
beer
great
this
humid
new
england
weather
try
this
one
its
a
great
beer
for
the
money
and
if
you
dont
like
it
send
the
remainder
to
me
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
for
those
who
like
strong
sweet
flavors
in
their
beer
but
dont
want
to
drink
something
heavy
like
a
stout
or
porter
and
dont
want
to
deal
with
something
silly
and
fruity
this
is
a
solid
option
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
interesting
sweet
and
tasty
but
almost
too
creamy
to
be
refreshingquenching
full
bodied
feel
offsets
the
carbonation
and
kicks
the
malt
profile
into
overdrive
i
want
to
say
interesting
again
for
emphasis
i
was
surprised
by
the
whole
experience
certainly
a
unique
take
on
the
style
overall
ultimately
the
sweetness
started
to
get
to
me
but
the
flavors
were
interesting
and
certainly
a
notch
or
two
above
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
american
wheat
swishy
good
carbonation
levels
a
little
sticky
lighten
it
up
a
bit
please
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
light
wheat
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
too
much
honey
and
too
sweet
for
me
maybe
with
some
dessert
on
a
hot
day
besides
that
one
and
done
for
me
although
i
cant
help
but
think
somehow
or
someway
that
this
beer
is
good
for
me
i
selected
bottle
for
this
review
as
my
most
recent
experience
was
from
a
bottle
my
first
experience
with
this
was
a
20oz
draft
at
the
brewery
initially
this
beer
really
appealed
to
me
the
first
scents
i
picked
up
were
floral
notes
tasting
presented
a
clear
honey
note
and
then
hints
of
floral
things
went
south
from
here
as
i
drank
the
scent
of
the
beer
moved
to
overly
sweet
and
almost
smelled
flat
does
not
hold
carbonation
well
in
both
bottle
and
draft
experiences
and
to
me
this
made
the
flavor
feel
heavy
as
another
reviewer
said
maybe
on
a
scorching
summer
day
this
might
feel
and
taste
right
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
finish
the
6
pack
i
brought
home
m
o
sweet
creamy
with
a
nice
medium
finish
very
wellbalanced
mdo
not
terribly
complex
or
flavorful
i
continue
to
enjoy
otter
creek
without
being
a
huge
fan
of
wolavers
it
is
smooth
refreshing
and
sessionable
maybe
i
should
go
mow
the
lawn
in
95
degree
weather
and
i
would
enjoy
it
more
its
a
decent
wheat
ale
with
a
hint
of
floral
notes
not
bad
this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
crisp
warm
weather
ales
ive
had
excellent
balance
of
honey
and
yeast
in
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
nice
fresh
mouthfeel
4
25
abv
makes
this
a
perfect
compliment
to
a
summer
lunchtime
sandwich
it
never
disappoints
one
of
otter
creekswolavers
best
along
with
the
oatmeal
stout
i
am
really
enjoying
this
one
this
summer
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
honey
wheat
everything
in
exceptional
balance
the
pour
is
hazy
orange
golden
with
a
fluffy
inch
of
pure
white
head
on
top
the
aromatics
of
this
beer
are
splendid
lots
of
sticky
clover
honey
light
and
flavorful
but
not
a
sugary
sweet
smell
at
all
notes
of
soft
white
wheat
and
relaxed
hops
are
also
present
the
flavor
is
exceptional
the
honey
is
present
all
the
way
through
bees
seem
to
swarm
to
my
glass
here
the
pollen
and
liveliness
of
this
is
remarkable
like
a
wildflower
itself
the
chamomile
is
just
right
too
not
tea
heavy
or
out
of
place
but
distinct
mildly
bitter
and
a
fitting
contrast
to
the
honey
this
is
an
artfully
made
beer
with
a
fuller
body
for
the
style
and
abv
which
i
love
crisp
and
clean
in
the
finish
despite
the
honey
perhaps
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
wolavers
overall
consider
me
impressed
with
this
one
the
honey
was
very
flavorful
and
worked
well
with
the
other
ingredients
pleasantly
surprised
had
never
seen
this
brand
always
afraid
of
beers
that
sell
themselves
on
organic
i
assume
most
craft
brewers
are
using
the
highest
quality
ingredients
they
can
come
by
this
has
proven
itself
as
a
great
beer
that
i
will
drink
and
share
as
often
as
i
can
find
it
o
a
nice
beer
with
an
amazing
mouthfeel
it
has
a
pleasant
sweetness
that
is
balanced
though
the
finish
might
be
sharp
o
havent
had
too
many
organics
when
it
comes
to
beers
but
this
one
is
top
notch
of
its
kind
perfect
for
spring
and
summer
great
beer
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
was
looking
for
something
different
but
not
too
light
the
color
was
of
a
light
beer
but
the
taste
was
very
nice
it
smelt
a
little
like
dirt
but
did
not
taste
that
way
at
all
i
would
be
able
to
drink
this
beer
on
a
regular
not
like
certain
beers
where
you
can
only
have
one
and
then
have
to
switch
it
up
nice
flavor
overall
a
bit
on
the
tart
side
for
me
but
that
is
to
be
expected
for
the
style
not
a
bad
flavor
profile
and
rather
refreshing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
haze
orangegold
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
throughout
and
a
slim
ring
of
frothy
white
head
around
the
surface
aromas
of
subtle
honey
and
lemon
sweetness
on
a
biscuit
and
wheat
background
smells
like
a
cookie
almost
flavors
are
rich
and
sweet
on
the
forward
tongue
almost
like
a
fall
seasonal
style
rich
buttery
tones
on
a
biscuit
backbone
give
the
palate
a
heavier
load
than
is
usual
for
summer
beers
or
wheats
for
that
matter
honey
and
banana
highlights
are
accented
with
some
cinnamon
and
clove
spicing
leaning
more
towards
the
white
style
no
hops
presence
to
speak
of
throughout
the
beer
the
aftertaste
is
light
with
some
roasted
qualities
accompanying
the
dying
sweetness
clean
fairly
crisp
finish
the
beer
is
kept
light
throughout
by
the
carbonation
and
balancing
flavors
this
was
nice
and
low
in
the
alcohol
department
which
made
it
perfect
for
a
nice
summer
day
not
a
lot
of
complexity
here
and
this
may
be
the
first
beer
of
the
season
that
i
would
want
to
have
as
a
dessert
because
of
the
honey
and
sugary
sweetness
no
doubt
that
this
is
better
than
the
lawnmower
beers
that
are
out
there
and
worth
a
try
for
those
looking
for
some
depth
during
the
hotter
days
d
light
fairly
refreshing
this
would
actually
make
a
very
unique
winter
seasonal
given
the
cinnamon
read
holiday
spicing
decent
but
not
something
that
i
would
readily
invest
in
each
and
every
summer
i
would
recommend
this
for
both
the
beach
and
the
christmas
party
a
simple
wheat
beer
thats
perfectly
suited
to
a
hot
summers
day
unremarkable
but
well
made
and
very
drinkable
sweet
and
floral
with
a
soothing
presence
without
being
cloying
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
great
perfect
for
the
summer
usually
when
i
say
that
it
means
that
this
is
a
beer
that
the
wife
is
drinking
and
im
just
sampling
it
hazy
deep
yellow
with
a
firm
creamy
head
aroma
is
mild
with
chamomile
and
light
grains
a
sip
reveals
a
mellow
tasty
balance
between
sweet
malts
and
a
mild
vanillachamomile
element
going
on
it
finishes
a
touch
sweet
but
not
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
creamy
overall
a
unique
take
on
an
american
wheat
ale
it
stands
apart
from
the
average
american
hefe
for
sure
quite
drinkable
and
worth
trying
served
in
a
weizen
glass
brew
pours
a
slightly
hazed
and
glowing
yellow
gold
with
a
nice
display
of
diverse
carbonation
bubbles
floating
toward
a
white
head
notes
of
sweet
honey
and
herb
im
guessing
chamomile
flowers
hint
at
a
zesty
and
possibly
tart
wheat
brew
dry
and
almost
sticky
mouth
coating
non
tart
flavors
of
honey
and
chamomile
gently
caress
the
palate
in
a
well
balanced
and
relatively
intense
concentration
of
flavor
stylistically
speaking
o
its
an
ok
beer
nothing
id
buy
lots
of
12oz

purchased
at

in
somersworth
pours
a
hazy
yellow
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
shortlived
white
head
smells
sweet
and
floral
with
banana
and
vanilla
notes
tastes
sweet
with
banana
and
nut
notes
as
well
as
floral
and
lemon
notes
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
very
drinkable
bright
and
flavorful
something
good
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
suspect
as
with
the
otter
creek
black
ipa
i
had
last
night
i
found
this
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
however
i
did
learn
from
my
experience
to
not
judge
this
brew
by
its
cover
dont
be
fooled
from
the
clipart
label
into
thinking
this
is
lightweight
beer
the
brewer
certainly
takes
hisher
art
seriously
and
you
should
too
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
by
this
brewer
in
my
area
an
excellent
organic
wheat
ale
with
a
noticeable
honey
nose
and
a
balanced
honey
taste
upon
drinking
a
thick
mouthfeel
that
reminds
me
of
honey
the
beer
tastes
reminds
me
of
mead
but
their
is
no
question
this
is
a
beer
a
nice
springtime
beer
had
it
at
the
blue
cat
resturant
in
burlington
vermont
had
it
again
at
blue
cat
its
just
as
good
as
my
previous
review
hard
to
find
in
the
bottle
not
a
sexy
looking
beer
but
drinks
pretty
fine
especially
for
such
a
lackluster
style
overall
the
flavor
is
nice
but
just
too
sweet
if
i
came
in
with
different
expectations
id
rate
this
more
highly
but
compared
to
other
beers
of
this
style
it
just
doesnt
measure
up
for
me
solid
brew
a
welcomed
change
up
for
summer
drinking
especially
if
you
like
hefes
or
other
wheat
beers
like
i
do
d
i
wish
it
hadnt
taken
my
so
long
into
the
summer
to
find
this
beer
well
balanced
easy
drinking
for
a
summer
afternoon
or
evening
definitely
pairs
well
with
lighter
foods
such
as
salads
and
grilled
corn
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
misleading
pours
a
goldenrodorange
yellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
lots
of
carbonation
clinging
to
the
outside
of
the
glass
smells
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
thats
about
it
taking
the
first
sip
is
indeed
surprising
tastes
of
brown
sugar
nutmeg
and
honey
very
little
in
the
way
of
hops
but
slightly
malty
overall
a
surprising
beer
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
overy
enjoyable
a
nice
twist
on
a
wheat
beer
that
adds
a
little
extra
flavor
while
still
maintaining
a
pretty
low
profile
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
when
served
from
the
tap
the
beer
had
about
a
finger
tall
white
head
and
poured
from
a
bottle
it
has
about
half
that
pours
a
beautiful
golden
color
very
summery
the
aroma
is
delicious
honey
and
cinnamon
dominate
this
spicy
flowery
scent
reminds
me
of
cinnamon
toast
crunch
or
golden
grahams
yum
and
taste
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
its
sweet
with
a
bit
of
a
hops
bite
and
a
strong
honey
flavor
combined
with
a
crisp
refreshing
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
almost
like
candy
liquid
alcoholic
candy
this
is
a
beautifully
balanced
beer
perfect
for
a
summer
afternoon
a
very
pleasant
surprise
for
someone
with
low
expectations
for
wheat
beers
this
is
a
very
agreeable
beer
with
a
charming
lightness
to
it
all
of
the
action
of
this
beer
takes
place
within
your
first
few
seconds
of
ingesting
it
and
disappears
before
you
even
swallow
at
the
outset
the
drinker
is
met
with
a
crisp
punch
of
sweet
honey
which
rapidly
dissipates
to
a
neutral
wheat
taste
all
around
pleasant
and
inoffensive
pours

overy
enjoyable
dont
know
if
it
is
something
i
can
drink
more
than
1
or
2
of
in

sitting
but
for
a
hot
summer
day
after
working
outdoors
this
beer
hits
the
spot
wonderfully
o
an
extremely
unique
beer
in
my
opinion
its
strong
aroma
really
took
me
by
surprise
and
overall
the
beers
backbone
is
its
floralhoney
notes
and
if
youre
into
that
its
definitely
worth
a
try
honey
and
wheat
pretty
much
sums
up
what
most
people
envision
in
a
spring
seasonal
most
sweet
honey
edge
with
some
bready
notes
and
a
very
fine
camomile
tea
fill
the
nose
had
to
take
a
sip
to
remind
ourselves
that
this
is
a
beer

credit
for
the

though

the

pushes
forward
hops
are
very
light
but
everything
is
in
bal
ance
for
a
delicate
dainty
beer
it
comes
off
as
being
drinkable
and
the
addition
of
camomile
makes
this
beer
extreme
on

at

monkey
in

city
serves
in

the
beer
has
an
initial
honey
aroma
that
is
supported
by
its
taste
its
light
in
color
and
slightly
hazy
as
most
wheat
beers
are
this
however
was
less
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
from
an
american
wheat
it
was
very
light
in
feel
but
had
a
nice
honey
and
fruit
flavor
the
wheat
taste
didnt
come
through
as
much
as
i
would
like
but
the
taste
overall
was
very
pleasant
overall
a
tasty
and
interesting
wheat
ale
iam
not
into

very

with

has
the
sort
of
greasy
texture
of

not

heavy
the

is
in
the
taste

at
the

than
others
it

bready
for

notes
i
see
this
being
a
very
good
hot

beer
middle
of
the

with

lunch

i
really
like

with
some
sweetness
that
doesnt
come
from
the
honey
maybe
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
the
mix
of
the
honey
with
this
one
works
really
well
and
kind
of
surprised
me
how
tasty
it
made
it
wheat
beers
are
hit
or
miss
in
my
experience
but
this
is
a
good
one
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
and
would
consider
buying
a
6
pack
of
it
overall
another
organic
offering
from
wolaver
but
kind
of
lackluster
if
anything
it
could
use
more
body
overall
this
seems
pretty
appropriate
for
the
style
light
enough
but
not
too
sweet
bright
and
clean
good
summer
drinker
but
wasnt
overly
impressed
by
the
interpretation
then
again
ive
had
gumballhead
and
lil
sumpin
sumpin
o
probably
a
beer
i
would
skip
over
in
the
future
this
brew
will
do
well
on
a
very
hot
day
when
you
need
some
added
refreshment
overall
a
highly
recommended
beer
drinkability
is
good
since
the
sweetness
is
not
cloying
and
the
beer
is
interesting
enough
to
have
multiple
pints
of
why
do
you
think
i
bought
a
growler
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
quite
refreshing
and
very
flavorful
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
a
highly
sessionable
brew
this
is
a
brew
that
i
would
seek
out
especially
would
be
great
for
summer
days
by
the
pool
the
motuhfeel
is
very
nice
the
body
is
appropriately
light
about
medium
in
strength
with
a
big
crispness
that
never
fades
but
gives
way
with
ample
but
not
overdone
carbonation
to
a
nice
smooth
finish
with
plenty
of
character
tastewheat
fresh
honey
sweet
biscuit
creamy
and
refreshing
but
hard
to
escape
the
lingering
sweetness
thats
there
from
start
to
finish
a
dose
of
spicy
or
citrus
hops
to
balance
things
out
a
bit
would
have
worked
wonders
in
my
opinion
but
that
being
said
its
still
a
decent
brew
to
try
wow
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
i
had
a
pint
at
volpes
in
emmaus
pa
yes
you
can
taste
the
honey
and
chamomile
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
chamomile
but
theyre
expertly
balanced
off
the
clean
crisp
and
distinct
bready
wheat
malts
typically
id
expect
the
spice
or
honey
to
dominate
and
define
the
beer
but
really
this
is
a
complex
american
wheat
that
doesnt
need
to
rely
on
massive
hops
flavor
heck
of
a
beer
for
the
style
and
just
plain
tasty
overall
check
this
out
pours
a
small
half
finger
head
that
only
hangs
in
there
for
a
little
bit
kinda
disappointing
there
the
head
is
pure
white
and
the
body
is
orange
golden
looking
it
looks
like
a
wheat
beer
should
look
its
very
cloudy
and
there
is
some
sediment
in
the
beer
it
looks
good
despite
the
wimpy
head
well
for
starters
on
the
smell
you
for
sure
get
that
flower
smell
which
smells
really
good
and
then
the
honey
and
a
vanilla
smell
which
both
smell
really
good
as
well
the
only
thing
that
is
a
little
off
with
the
smell
is
the
generic
beer
smell
that
im
getting
which
i
dont
like
but
the
beer
still
smells
really
good
as
a
whole
oh
man
this
beer
is
so
fing
tasty
wow
you
first
just
get
punched
in
the
mouth
with
that
honey
flavor
then
comes
a
little
vanilla
and
that
flower
taste
to
polish
it
off
on
some
tastes
i
notice
different
things
first
thats
how
well
mixed
in
everything
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
or
malts
but
who
cares
amazing
taste
the
generic
beer
taste
is
very
small
if
even
there
at
all
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
of
a
wheat
beer
but
its
not
the
worst
ive
ever
had
its
still
got
some
back
bone
to
it
overall
the
taste
makes
this
a
damn
good
beer
there
are
factors
that
are
weak
and
if
they
were
better
this
might
be
a
perfect
beer
in
my
opinion
but
as
it
stands
now
damn
good
beer
the
color
is
quite
nice
with
a
nice
head
overall
pour
me
another
im
ready
to
drink
pours

golden

with
a
thin
white

much

decent
laceing
aroma
is
floral
with
wheat
and
honey
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
of
sweet
fruit
honey
and
wheat
spicy
and
creamy
throghout
with
a
bit
of
tart
in
the
finish
really
good
this
beer
is
full
of
flavor
and
differs
from
other
wolavers
offerings
because
you
can
actually
taste
it
its
certainly
worth
a
try
o

i
really
dont
like
the
belgian
wheat
flavor
the
nose
let
me
know
that
this
was
going
to
be
not
a
hit
for
me
overall
boulders
sweaty
betty
is
a
decent
beer
it
has
the
traditional
flavors
of
a
wheat
beer
which
is
why
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
fans
of
wheat
beers
should
really
like
this
beer
though

that
thats
a
bad
thing
clean

fair
summer
refresher

a
better

than
what
youll
find
at
many

parties
this
beer
is
actually
a
really
good
beer
i
actually
liked
it
a
lot
i
know
that
i
will
have
this
beer
again
i
liked
the
smell
and
the
taste
to
this
beer
it
has
a
smooth
taste
to
it
it
is
not
a
heavy
beer
and
i
liked
that
avout
this
beer
i
know
that
i
will
have
this
beer
again
i
also
will
recomend
it
to
friends
and
family
as
well

of

along

the
glass
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
rising
up
from
the
bottom
and
sides
of
the

very
little

is
seen
the
aroma
is
of
malts
and
wheat
with
a
hint
of
light
spice
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
a
light
hint
of
citrus
as
well
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
a
great
summer
seasonal
brew
for
a
hot
day
overall
i
like
this
one
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
caramel
banana
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
banana
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
a
nice
smell
but
the
flavors
arent
as
good
in
my
opinion
mixed
feelings
on
this
one
if
the
carbonation
and
flavors
were
turned
up
a
notch
i
think
i
would
like
it
a
lot
as
it
is
i
could
see
this
being
a
satisfactory
choice
on
a
hot
day
id
definitely
drink
it
again
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it
o
not
a
bad
bier
try
one
on
o
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
wheat
beers
but
this
one
seems
to
be
a
slightly
above
average
overall
hot
summer
day
less
than
a
buck
25
per
beer
this
is
worth
sharing
with
your
lady
and
scoring
brownie
points
i
know
when
i
reach
for
a
tasty
beverage
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
sweat
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
cracked
wheat
banana
peel
light
orange
peel
and
a
dash
of
muddled
spices
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
heavy
bready
component
leading
the
charge
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
middling
beer
at
best
one
that
just
kinda
sits
there
with
little
or
no
distinguishing
character
of
its
own
sure
i
suppose
this
could
be
used
as
a
nice
enough
thirstquencher
in
the
summer
months
but
its
just
kinda
bland
for
my
tastes
beyond
that
overall
a
big
let
down
i
got
it
from
a
bar
that
offered
a
ton
of
different
beers
to
maybe
it
was
a
stale
keg
but
i
probably
wont
try
this
again
might
come
back
to
this
one
at
some
point
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
boulder
beer
but
this
wheat
ale
is
far
from
bad
some
may
not
like
the
slightly
muddled
character
but
i
kind
of
appreciate
it
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
knocking
back
one
of
these
if
it
were
readily
available
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
it
comes
with
a
healthy
kick
too
i
want
more
it
is
a
spring
beer
that
only
comes
around
once
a
year
but
i
anticipate
having
this
beer
and
beg
my
supplier
to
have
it
in
stock
for
me
from
the
great
clean
taste
to
the
appearance
and
feel
of
this
beer
it
gets
consistent
high
marks
from
me
o
this
beer
is
a
beer
i
would
come
back
to
again
and
again
not
only
do
i
like
it
for
the
style
it
is
also
a
beer
that
is
just
enjoyable
period
i
am
a
fan
of
sweeter
brews
and
there
is
just
something
about
this
beer
that
i
really
like
12
ounce

pours
very
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
nice
12
finger
dense
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
nice
spotty
foamy

clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
big
lemon
banana
clove
wheat
pear
pepper
light

nice

of
flavors
a
bit
more
watered
down
than
i
expected
with
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
lightly
creamy
and
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
nearly
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
wheat
ale
nice
amount
of
hefeweizen
flavor
complexity
and
balance
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
definitely
an
enjoyable
offering
its
mostly
cloudy
and
yellow
with
a
very
weak
head
the
tate
is
nice
add
yeasty
as
it
should
be
the
overall
impression
is
of
a
light
to
medium
wheat
it
is
similar
to
the
bottle
and
somewhat
disappointing
it
also
has
a
higher
abv
at
nearly
6
percent
but
without
the
heavier
spirit
taste
youd
never
know
it
from
the
taste
it
goes
down
like
a
4
8
so
beware
its
smooth
and
w
the
higher
alcohol
content
could
pack
a
punch
i
wont
get
again
overall
this
is
just
a
thin
bodied
slightly
sweet
something
wheaty
beer
with
few
high
points
even
on
a
warm
day
overall
i
can
say
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
date
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
though
for
someone
looking
for
an
incredible
amount
of
flavor
you
might
want
something
else
but
for
an
easy
drinking
and
delicious
beer
you
cant
beat
one
of
these
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
at
some
point
overall
my
buddy
recommended
this
beer
and
i
think
maybe
he
was
playing
an
evil
trick
on
me
terribly
weak
from
nearly
every
possible
angle
this
is
not
a
wheat
beer
that
id
care
to
try
again
overall
very
easy
drinking
but
a
little
subtle
and
boring
for
the
most
part
o
a
very
tasty
blonde
wheat
ale
excellent
for
a
hot
summer
july
evening
cheers
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
i
will
buy
over
harpoon
and
sa
certainly
will
suit
the
nontraditional
hefe
taster
as
it
may
seem
light
to
those
more
experienced
palates
also
checks
in
at
5
9
but
doesnt
taste
like
it
i
loved
the
finish
and
after
taste
overall
fits
very
hot
weather
as
its
extremely
light
but
id
like
more
flavour
overall
i
just
didnt
like
this
beer
period
everything
from
its
appearance
to
taste
had
something
about
it
i
didnt
like
i
also
dont
like
the
5
9
for
a
wheat
beer
seems
a
bit
high
however
i
dont
regret
trying
it
and
ill
finish
the
sixer
just
not
again
o
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
and
like
i
said
perfect
for
what
it
is
an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
summer
beer
i
think
boulder
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
and
when
i
want
something
like
this
again
i
will
return
nice
summer
brew
from
boulder
simple
and
quenching
4
0
o
has
some
good
qualities
for
a
wheat
light
floral
refreshing
although
not
a
style
i
usually
go
for
this
one
is
good
o
not
bad
for
a
wheat
ale
as
you
may
know
already
i
havent
had
many
but
this
one
isnt
bad
for
what
it
is
a
pleasant
little
beer
with
a
good
unique
character
works
for
me
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
with
not
much
head
to
speak
of
the
taste
has
a
nice
wheat
character
with
hints
of
banana
throughout
it
it
also
has
a
nice
dry
taste
that
makes
it
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
sunny
day
carbonation
is
fizzy
but
works
well
as
a
whole
not
my
favorite
style
but
its
a
decent
beer
for
sure
o
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
with
a
little
flavor
or
complexity
youve
been
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
overall
this
one
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
would
love
to
buy
it
again
a
pretty
decent
wheat
ale
good
flavor
character
and
otherwise
solid
in
everything
you
would
expect
from
a
wheat
brew
would
have
again

d

i
like
me
a
good
apwa
from
time
to
time
overall
acceptable
but
there
are
better
choices
o
im
not
crazy
about
the
style
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
offering
for
the
style
these
types
often
taste
cheap
this
one
doesnt
that
said
i
wont
seek
it
out
a
decent
one
although
flawed
the
balance
of
flavor
is
there
just
lacks

going

discernably

hopping
is

around

relatively
balanced
mildly
sweet
a
little
metallic
bitterness
creeps
into
the
mouthfeel
what
was
once
a
small
dallop
of
tartness
gets
progressively
more
aggressive
as
the
metal
exerts
itself
made
me
wonder
if
this
was
part
of
the
weird
pallet
of
boulder
beer
come
into
reno
recently
conclusion
fine
work
by
boulder
beer
this
is
a
very
light
beer
and
i
think
it
would
work
amazingly
on
cask
in
the
summer
or
out
of
a
growler
at
least
less
carbonation
for
some
reason
i
always
had
the
impression
that
this
wasnt
a
worthwhile
beer
and
i
am
happy
to
be
corrected
boulder
beer
sticks
mostly
to
mainstream
styles
but
they
do
them
well
sweaty
betty
is
definitely
a
dishwater
blonde
shes
sorta
weak
altogether
now
look
if
you
do
not
like
the
traditional
skunk
of
a
heffe
then
you
may
actually
enjoy
this
the
appearance
when
poured
was
cloudy
and
not
in
a
good
way
the
nose
was
a
metallic
skunk
reminding
me
of
fennel
the
head
was
shortlived
at
best
but
it
kicked
up
high
initially
like
a
wheat
should
i
expect
a
fruity
experience
from
an
american
wheat
totally
disappointed
as
were
my
beer
geeks
this
is
a
fine
sessioning
beer
the
flavor
is
good
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
makes
it
an
easily
consumed
beverage
that
i
would
certainly
recommend
to
friends
and
would
like
to
see
offered
in
12
packs
o
better
than
many
of
the
other
hefeweizens
out
there
but
id
be
fine
not
having
this
again
drink
this
was
pretty
tasty
for
an
extra
im
not
normally
the
biggest
blonde
fan
so
i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
after
seeing
the
reviews
and
bottle
closely
its
more
pale
wheat
above
all
else
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
poured
ontap
at
la
festa
brick
and
brew
in
dover
nh
the
beer
was
poured
in
a
pint
glass
and
it
settles
into
a
pale
unfiltered
look
with
a
musty
yellow
coloring
and
lots
of
carbonation
there
is
a
thin
quarterinch
smallbubbled
head
the
nose
is
citrusy
with
lemon
zest
and
butter
characteristics
the
beers
flavors
are
light
and
crisp
with
a
slight
toasting
and
underlying
citrus
sweetness
the
aftertaste
is
minimal
but
with
a
zesty
and
tangy
fruit
sweetness
the
finish
is
a
little
sweet
and
syrupy
good
light
brew
for
a
hot
day
but
not
anything
extraordinary
in
terms
of
substance
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
has
an
easydrinking
quality
about
it
the
body
while
not
thick
definitely
has
a
meatiness
to
it
that
really
helps
the
flavors
stand
out
the
carbonation
is
a
little
fizzy
but
does
not
seem
to
detract
from
the
flavors
m
theres
some
crispness
a
thin
body
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
sweaty
betty
is
boulder
beers
entry
into
the
wheat
beer
style
i
personally
love
wheat
beers
theyre
refreshing
taste
like
a
meal
and
have
a
wonderful
consistency
and
high
standard
between
breweries
with
enough
flexibility
in
style
and
character
to
make
each
one
different
boulder
beers
wheat
feels
less
like
a
unique
brew
than
others
easy
street
wheat
for
example
tastes
very
different
but
remains
an
deeply
satisfying
beer
the
aroma
is
strong
and
seducing
packed
with
lemon
white
grapes
and
the
by
now
familiar
coupling
of
banana
esters
and
a
touch
of
exotic
clove
the
flavor
is
less
thrilling
losing
much
of
its
depth
in
a
haze
of
heavy
carbonation
i
mostly
detect
wheat
and
corn
tortilla
flavors
gradually
panning
out
to
include
some
banana
on
the
tongue
but
tragically
little
the
sweaty
betty
is
still
a
fair
sample
of
the
style
and
i
hope
to
set
it
aside
and
drink
it
in
comparative
calm
and
quiet
however
as
a
coasterdampener
for
a
cool
summer
evening
it
fared
admirably
even
if
not
spectacularly
the
memory
of
that
evening
belongs
to
the
grill
and
the
sunset
not
the
beer
it
pours
out
a
pale
straw
colored
beer
pretty
cloudy
with
a
small
and
shortlived
white
head
topping
it
off
the
nose
consists
of
wheat
grain
and
pale
malt
with
some
hints
of
floral
hop
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
starts
off
with
pale
malt
a
fair
amount
of
wheat
grain
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
finishes
with
a
splash
of
lemon
juice
and
a
light
floral
hop
background
a
bit
of
spice
as
well
maybe
just
a
hint
of
banana
as
well
a
taste
i
more
often
associate
with
hefes
than
filtered
wheats
light
mouthfeel
and
pretty
refreshing
a
bright
and
easydrinking
session
ale
quite
enjoyable
overall
this
is
quite
good
beer
and
unique
enough
in
flavor
to
set
itself
apart
from
many
of
its
peers
the
brew
is
balanced
and
flavorful
and
would
i
suspect
be
quite
thirstquenching
in
midsummer
worth
trying
onot
bad
id
buy
it
again
for
some
sort
of
summer
event
a
nice
summer
ale
got
on
growler
poured
a
yellow
gold
color
with
minimal
head
looks
and
smells
prett
unassuming
but
its
got
a
nice
taste
of
wheat
and
yeast
with
a
touch
of
clove
maybe
some
sort
of
other
fruit
to
goes
down
really
smooth
nice
and
refreshing
not
to
much
of
a
bite
but
thats
alright
o
an
average
wheat
beer
that
goes
down
smoothly
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
by
no
means
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
out
there
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
i
think
a
good
representation
of
a
wheat
ale
ooverall
this
is
an
ok
wheat
beer
would
drink
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
probably
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
again
theres
better
wheat
beers
out
there
overall
a
solid
brew
but
nothing
above
normal
or
setting
it
apart
quite
drinkable
and
decent
taste
a
little
off
and
light
on
the
nose
with
average
presentation
overall
wow
to
surprised
those
expecting
to
review
to
style
fail
for
the
brewery
but
for
a
guy
expecting
the
typical
blonde
it
drank
rather
well
kudos
guys
this
is
a
nice
brew
overall
i
wasnt
too
impressed
after
hearing
a
story
how
its
an
american
wheat
it
wasnt
light
bodied
or
light
yeast
tasting
like
a
lot
of
american
wheats
more
of
a
hef
or
wit
m
light
body
shade
watery
underwhelming
carbonation
overall
this
might
not
be
the
best
or
even
in
the
top
10
in
pale
wheats
but
i
could
knock
back
many
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
on
par
with
goose
312
without
the
lemon
the
feel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
prickley
overall
nothing
bad
but
nothing
great
i
dont
see
myself
going
back
to
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
sweaty
betty
pours
out
like
a
typical
wheat
beer
with
some
haze
but
also
seems
a
bit
lighter
in
color
the
aroma
smells
soft
like
wheat
and
some
banana
the
taste
is
on
the
light
side
almost
too
light
for
a
wheat
beer
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
is
very
drinkable
and
easy
going
i
just
wish
this
beer
was
a
little
bit
more
flavorful
it
really
doesnt
have
many
bragging
rights
there
are
better
wheat
beers
out
there
than
this
one
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
moderate
white
head
and
a
lively
carbonation
which
helps
retain
the
head
thoughout
most
of
the
brew
the
nose
is
bright
with
mostly
wheat
influenced
flavors
aromas
of
banana
peach
white
clove
and
maybe
a
faint
touch
of
hoppy
flowers
the
palate
is
mediumbodied
and
creamy
with
a
smooth
delivery
and
flavors
of
banana
lemon
and
vanilla
leading
to
a
moderate
fruity
and
mouthwatering
finish
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
its
done
well
for
the
style
o
this
is
my
second
beer
out
of
a
boulder
mix
pack
and
im
starting
to
sense
a
pattern
is
this
an
amazing
beer
or
a
shining
example
of
the
style
no
is
it
highly
drinkable
and
relatively
enjoyable
yes
in
fact
i
could
see
giving
this
to
some
noncraft
beer
drinking
friends
and
probably
have
them
enjoy
it
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
small
frothy
white
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
light
of
grain
malts
flowery
hops
sweet
yeast
and
a
nice
hint
of
citrus
it
tasted
sweet
and
yeasty
at
first
and
finished
with
a
light
sweet
yeast
and
citrus
flavor
that
lasted
a
decent
amount
of
time
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
a
little
watery
in
texture
overall
a
very
nice
blonde
wheat
ale
great
for
the
warm
weather
not
to
heavy
but
not
to
light
a
quality
beer
that
should
be
consumed
over
and
over
one
of
my
new
favorites
fairly
drinkablei
could
enjoy
2
or
3
but
any
more
than
that
and
the
sweetness
would
be
too
much
dvery
strong
marks
here
i
had
been
disappointed
with
my
recent
luck
with
wheat
ales
but
i
found
this
one
quite
refreshing
and
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
pours
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
touches
of
very
white
foam
smells
wheaty
with
some
banana
notes
full
wheaty
taste
with
underlying
lemon
citrus
throughout
smooth
mouthfeel
residual
tang
very
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
refreshing
to
boot
d
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
d
pretty
solid
apwa
i
dont
know
if
i
would
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
but
it
is
a
better
than
average
wheat
ale
d
i
marked
the
drinkability
as
a
4
good
because
again
for
the
style
it
is
above
average
and
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
if
in
the
mood
for
a
light
refreshing
summer
beer
d
a
mix
between
a
hefeweizen
and
a
blue
moon
awesome
beer
easy
for
a
new
beer
drinker
or
a
party
beer
d
very
refreshing
for
a
beer
and
likely
to
have
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
daynight
im
impressed
by
this
beers
drinkability
and
character
im
not
exactly
sure
what
separates
this
from
a
hefe
but
its
definitely
a
tasty
summer
option
on
tap
on
a
whim
not
the
best
decision
but
ok
i
guess
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
little
head
nose
is
witbeeresque
lemony
notes
a
bit
of
spice
some
wheatiness
to
it
too
taste
follows
with
the
same
notes
but
theres
something
off
here
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
light
and
refreshing
body
not
a
terrible
beer
but
probably
not
one
i
would
order
again
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
dry
coriander
and
cinnamon
in
the
taste
cinnamon
and
a
lemon
zest
a
spicy
bite
with
a
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
and
a
dry
spice
to
clean
aftertaste
nice
spices
and
easy
to
drink
and
decent
this
is
like
a
blonde
alepale
wheat
hybrid
i
think
it
mostly
succeeds
easy
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
d
served
cold
enough
this
beer
would
go
down
easy
and
refresh
on
a
hot
day
save
it
for
the
poolside
the
body
is
light
and
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
good
crispness
this
one
is
pretty
refreshing
its
a
good
hot
day
drinker
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
oct
07
2010
and
sampled
on
august
17
2010
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
and
very
cloudy
with
a
thinner
but
slightly
foamy
white
head
that
never
quite
fades
banana
wheat
and
yeast
aromas
are
the
first
to
greet
the
nose
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
comforting
fresh
hop
ending
really
not
all
that
bad
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
not
an
earth
shattering
beer
by
any
means
but
a
solid
quality
summer
wheat
ale
that
is
both
light
and
delicious
taste
is
light
with
not
as
much
spiciness
that
i
would
have
expected
from
this
style
of
beer
though
it
hides
its
5
9
abv
rather
well
overall
it
is
pretty
light
and
refreshing
and
makes
a
nice
summertime
drink
overall
this
is
not
a
good
wheat
ale
as
there
is
a
definite
lack
of
taste
throughout
maybe
if
they
dropped
the
price
and
marketed
this
as
a
cheap
lawnmower
beer
it
would
be
worth
it
if
your
looking
for
a
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
for
summer
id
go
with
this
one
poured
gold
with
less
than
one
finger
of
white
poor
retention
and
spotty
lacing
not
much
of
a
nose
besides
some
modest
banana
and
lemon
very
thin
flavor
profile
and
raw
bitter
finish
definitely
missing
more
fruit
balance
thin
bodied
and
decently
carbonated
nice
feel
for
sessioning
but
unfortunately
not
enough
flavor
md
medium
bodied
and
feels
slightly
harsh
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
ok
but
not
something
i
like
to
continue
drinking
d
an
easy
drinking
and
mild
brew
with
some
citrus
character
its
nice
for
summertime
light
thirst
quenching
refreshing
etc
but
as
far
as
being
bavarian
style
i
could
appreciate
a
bit
more
yeast
spiciness
o
this
is
not
my
style
i
like
wheat
beers
but
prefer
the
banana
flavors
over
the
apple
its
a
personal
thing
i
know
it
is
worth
a
try
but
im
glad
i
dont
have
a
six
pack
d
very
typical
for
the
style
a
nice
beer
that
succeeds
but
fails
to
stand
out
the
persistently
sweet
finish
is
a
nice
touch

medium

not
my
favorite
beer
by
any
stretch
its
light

easy
to
drink
might
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
its
kind
of
bland
with
nothing
really
exciting
happening
this
beer
is
what
i
would
consider
a
staple
sweaty
betty
offers
a
light
easy
to
drink
banana
undertone
with
a
thin
wispy
head
of
average
retention
when
you
are
going
with
an
alternative
brew
this
is
a
decent
candidate
dont
let
the
negative
reviews
keep
you
from
trying
it
at
the
very
least
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
it
was
very
clean
and
had
a
banana
note
along
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
crisp
finish
i
had
a
couple
of
six
packs
of
this
over
the
summer
and
they
went
down
easy
and
although
its
not
easy
to
find
here
i
will
be
hunting
for
it
in
the
future
it
makes
a
nice
replacement
for
the
abita
strawberry
lager
that
i
really
love
but
cant
get
very
often
betty
hasnt
improved
her
diet
her
sweat
is
still
funky
and
not
in
the
good
way
poured
from
a
brown
12

color
with

spices
taste
like
it
smells
spices
and
citrus
quite
delicious
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
brew
d
the
funkified
finish
in
this
beer
absolutely
killed
it
for
me
initially
an
ok
representation
of
the
style
but
it
went
downhill
and
fast
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
strong
wheat
and
banana
ester
aromas
bubble
out
of
this
well
carbonated
brew
white
head
forms
on
the
top
of
a
beautifully
hazy
blond
color
wheat
and
banana
flavors
dominate
the
palate
and
are
well
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
spice
smooth
fruity
finish
fades
gracefully
away
d
a
good
offering
in
a
category
that
seems
to
be
rife
with
simply
fair
beers
i
would
recommend
this
one
for
those
not
quite
summer
yet
spring
days
very
lightbodied
refresher
that
has
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
the
aroma
of
the
beer
says
hefe
more
than
the
taste
there
is
a
touch
of
cloviness
but
the
crisp
wheat
is
the
main
flavor
the
light
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
even
allows
some
mild
hop
notes
through
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
drink
some
more
of
i
like
the
name
and
the
label
as
well
or
not
well
thats
a
little
too
harsh
the
beer
is
best
described
as
weak
all
the
flavours
on
the
nose
are
in
the
beer
i
think
but
they
are
so
weak
they
can
be
scarcely
tasted
save
my
hunting
for
them
the
beer
seems
watered
down
as
it
has
a
very
low
carbonation
there
is
a
higher
maltiness
at
least
i
think
thats
what
it
is
at
the
outset
and
it
finishes
with
a
some
citrus
before
it
all
too
quickly
falls
off
the
palate
as
though
i
had
never
consumed
it
its
a
beer
i
could
drink
lots
of
simply
because
it
doesnt
feel
like
much
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
would
want
to
drink
that
much
of
it
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
just
wish
i
had
this
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
by
the
grill
instead
of
holed
up
in
my
house
watching
snow
fall
outside
i
will
certanly
revisit
this
one
once
the
spring
hits
d
easy
drinking
by
flavor
although
i
would
find
this
to
be
a
pairing
beer
something
i
would
put
with
a
meal
to
counteract
its
stronger
flavors
abv
is
a
cut
above
for
a
wheat
so
this
may
knock
you
out
as
it
refreshes
you
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
brew
is
a
little
disappointing
i
am
a
fan
of
the
boulder
brew
especially
the
anniversary
brews
it
is
a
little
wet
grassy
smelling
and
has
some
banana
and
slight
hop
notes
the
taste
is
a
little
bland
with
a
higher
carbonation
than
anticipated
the
most
dominant
is
banana
with
a
light
malt
backbone
and
a
little
bitter
hop
finish
this
is
by
far
the
least
tasty
of
the
brews
i
have
had
from
them
as
of
late
good
thing
picked
it
up
as
a
single
md
light
mouthfeel
and
nice
carb
average
wheat
with
common
wheat
pepper
yeasty
notes
a
touch
watery
but
might
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
d
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
from
boulder
beer
its
a
nice
refresher
that
seems
best
suited
to
warm
summer
days
definitely
worth
a
revisit
moreys
bottom
line
i
tried
to
be
as
fair
as
possible
while
reviewing
this
beer
but
this
just
isnt
my
favorite
style
if
youre
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
then
i
see
no
reason
why
you
wouldnt
enjoy
this
blonde
for
an
evening
drinkability
refreshing
easy
good
one
for
a
pitcher
in
the
sunshine
with
your
mates
on
first
sip
i
knew
this
one
had
missed
its
mark
not
by
much
but
definately
not
an
award
winner
it
is
not
balanced
between
the
yeast
the
hops
the
concept
at
all
sweaty
betty
turned
out
to
be
a
very
appropriate
moniker
as
this
beer
really
did
taste
kind
of
sweaty
i
want
to
try
the
beer
this
would
have
been
without
the
10k
it
just
ran
behind
it
it
has
promise
underneath
its
hesitant
and
unfulfilled
idea
but
for
now
i
will
not
be
purchasing
it
again
md
if
it
wasnt
for
the
smell
the
drinkability
would
be
higher
i
dread
the
next
sip
because
i
will
smell
the
beer
from
my
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
weak
but
thats
to
be
expected
given
the
style
fairly
strong
aroma
is
wheaty
and
yeasty
with
just
a
touch
of
lemon
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
and
none
too
persistent
white
head
flavor
is
wheaty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
slightly
yeasty
not
all
that
inspiring
flavor
is
smooth
and
fairly
tingly
sometimes
just
a
tad
watery
tastes
moderate
malt
sweet
that
carries
mediumstrong
clovey
phenol
also
quite
yeasty
mild
hop
bitter
and
little

very
german
in
character
is
this
beer
misclassified
here
on

as
an
american
pale
wheat
judged
to
category
listed
here
on

wet
on
the
tongue
but
dries
out

creaminess
in
mouthfeel
and
modest
carbonation
epic
fail
for
the
style
but
a
decent
german
wheat
on
tap
at
smoken
joes
served
in
a
16
oz
mug
probably
the
most
yellow
and
cloudy
looking
pale
wheat
ale
ive
had
almost
looked
like
a
witbier
super
faded
yellow
in
color
thin
white
head
clove
smell
not
overly
flavorful
though
which
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
it
was
good
but
it
was
not
bursting
at
the
seams
with
all
the
flavors
i
love
from
a
wheat
beer
that
said
it
was
mighty
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
from
a
large
glass
almost
too
easy
to
drink
as
it
went
down
fast
if
only
i
enjoyed
it
more
before
it
was
gone
oh
well
id
order
one
again
poured
into
my
weizen
glass
a
murky
pale
yellow
with
a
decentsized
offwhite
head
on
top
very
little
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
of
bananas
light
spices
and
bread
the
mouth
was
crisp
and
bubbly
a
little
wet
but
not
that
bad
the
flavor
is
a
little
zesty
to
start
with
but
it
finishes
bready
and
grainy
sort
of
a
cheerio
flavor
going
on
this
is
more
like
a
hefe
rather
than
a
pale
wheat
not
bad
but
a
little
different
than
i
expected
refreshing
nonetheless
d
very
drinkable
wheat
beer
d
although
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
rings
in
at
5
9
abv
it
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
while
this
could
definitely
be
downed
easily
there
are
much
cheaper
beers
out
there
for
that
purpose
dgiven
the
right
place
and
time
this
beer
would
hit
the
spot
though
that
can
probably
be
said
about
just
about
any
beer
especially
on
a
hot
summer
saturday
afternoon
that
said
for
sitting
down
and
enjoying
a
brew
this
beer
is
of
average
quality
and
not
my
favorite
of
boulders
lineup
sweaty
betty
blonde
is
a
slightly
hazy
pale
straw
colored
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
that
disappears
it
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
there
isnt
much
aroma
a
hint
of
lemon
and
maybe
banana
and
apple
its
pretty
light
bodied
but
soft
and
fluffy
with
a
clean
bubbly
finish
it
tastes
simple
and
light
but
well
balanced
and
clean
pear
oil
is
present
but
not
strong
even
the
bitterness
seems
fruity
its
tangy
and
refreshing
tm
the
palate
is
a
lot
more
of
the
nose
a
nice
dose
of
hops
gives
this
beer
some
great
character
and
a
cool
crispness
that
lends
itself
well
to
hot
summer
days
the
hops
are
grainy
perhaps
a
touch
citrusy
which
nicely
complements
the
wheat
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
even
though
the
head
is
almost
gone
the
guy
who
sold
the
bottle
to
me
gave
this
beer
a
lot
of
praise
pours
a
cloudy
witbier
blond
with
a
disappointing
soda
fizz
for
a
head
smells
good
though
cloves
banana
yeasty
sweet
rolls
altogether
makes
for
an
enticing
aroma
tastes
just
like
it
smells
for
my
taste
it
badly
needs
more
carbonation
rather
than
dancing
on
the
tongue
or
delivering
a
refreshing
feel
its
body
feels
flat
and
lifeless
a
bad
quality
in
a
summer
beer
all
in
all
it
tastes
good
and
is
worth
trying
but
needs
that
extra
carbonation
to
give
it
some
snap
this
beer
isnt
the
worst
it
has
a
decent
abv
that
is
well
masked
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
style
that
i
can
appreciate
fully
so
i
will
give
the
rest
of
them
to
my
friends
who
like
this
style
i
will
not
buy
this
beer
again
there
are
many
other
better
versions
of
the
style
on
the
plus
side
you
could
probably
down
many
of
these
no
problem
you
know
if
you
had
a
rough
day
at
work
or
something
note
i
actually
put
half
of
it
in
the
glass
back
in
the
fridge
and
came
back
to
it
an
hour
later
its
still
really
gross
on
the
finish
pale
yellow
and
a
bit
cloudy
with
a
light
white
head
mild
prickle
rising
in
the
glass
the
nose
has
notes
that
are
similar
to
a
white
beerale
as
there
are
grape
and
wheat
characters
that
i
can
pickup
mild
attack
and
clean
flavor
with
a
breaking
malt
finish
that
results
in
a
dry
and
clean
aftertaste
the
flavor
just
seems
to
break
away
as
it
leaves
the
mouth
the
beer
causes
me
to
think
of
the
white
ale
from
new
south
brewing
in
myrtle
beach
sc
only
the
sweaty
betty
isnt
as
good
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
to
it
the
smell
is
of
wheat
with
hints
of
some
floral
notes
the
overall
taste
is
of
wheat
with
hints
of
some
citrus
hop
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
the
drinkability
of
this
is
okay
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
the
beer
but
there
is
nothing
to
make
you
sit
up
and
say
hey
i
really
like
that
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
sweaty
betty
doesnt
quite
hold
up
against
some
of
my
favorites
but
if
you
hand
me
one
this
summer
im
going
to
be
happy
to
see
it
every
time
poured
a
pale
straw
color
with
little
head
no
lace
smelles
a
mix
of
citrus
and
spice
can
note
some
hops
very
bland
taste
like
watered
down
citrus
very
light
feel
not
very
refreshing
for
the
citrusy
smell
taste
not
very
impressed
but
then
again
i
got
it
for
free
d
this
is
a
very
good
hot
weather
beer
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
a
little
underrated
i
am
a
fan
of
this
beer
d
very
drinkable
on
a
nice
hot
day
id
have
another
one
d
great
summer
beer
when
its
really
hot
and
your
not
doing
anything
drinkability
this
broad
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
but
the
bananas
may
overwhelm
some
palettes
close
resemblance
to
the
spicy
belgian
whites
lots
of
wheat
providing
a
souring
finish
very
highly
carbonated
tiny
bubbles
theres
some
body
to
counterbalance
this
but
it
is
still
quite
spritzy
on
the
tongue
drinkability
very
much
so
a
pretty
good
representation
of
this
style
recommended
a
very
decent
pale
wheat
appearance
is
golden
with
some
head
and
almost
no
lacing
smell
is
good
but
a
bit
weak
with
sweet
malt
and
caramel
coming
through
taste
has
a
bit
more
of
dry
fruit
on
the
back
end
but
other
than
that
prety
straight
forward
mouthfeel
is
right
on
par
well
carbonated
and
light
drinkability
is
good
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
light
yellow
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
slight
earthy
hops
sweet
malts
and
sweet
fruit
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
wheat
and
hops
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
bubblegum
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
d
easily
drinkable
decent
flavors
certainly
nothing
offensive
just
nothing
special
either
easy
drinking
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
d
decent
nothing
too
extreme
makes
this
a
perfect
warm
weather
beer
not
bad
i
like
it
and
its
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
sessionable
as
well
betty
will
be
in
my
rotation
as
long
as
shes
around
d
i
sipped
the
1st
for
reviewing
then
the
2nd
was
gone
in
a
several
large
quaffs
ill
buy
it
again
problem
is
there
are
so
many
good
choices
now
for
warm
weather
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
54
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
earthy
malt
biscuit
lemon
and
some
tart
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
lemon
yeast
cleanliness
some
biscuit
mustiness
and
slight
hop
in
the
background
overall
a
good
bodied
beer
with
a
slightly
off
aroma
but
still
worthy
of
a
try
d
it
is
definitely
drinkable
easy
to
drink
decent
flavors
not
a
preference
however
would
drink
again
if
offered
but
probably
not
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
even
when
i
gulped
down
the
first
sip
all
i
could
taste
was
that
yestfilled
armpit
smell
in
my
mouth
it
was
bad
i
usually
like
wheat
ales
but
this
one
was
a
loser
d
very
nice
summer
brew
ill
grab
a
few
this
summer
quite
good
and
refreshing
for
the
style
wheats
have
never
been
my
cup
of
rea
but
this
is
great
for
the
style
out
of
a
22oz
bottle
this
beer
was
a
slightly
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
tons
of
visible
rising
carbonation
the
head
was
offwhite
a
full
three
fingers
high
displayed
modest
retention
as
a
cap
and
left
some
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
floral
hops
wheat
lemon
and
orange
zest
and
doughy
malt
the
flavors
were
much
like
a
witbier
sweet
citrus
tang
up
front
with
wheat
in
the
middle
and
some
pale
malt
flavors
in
the
background
simple
but
pleasant
enough
the
flavors
do
seem
to
compete
with
each
other
a
little
however
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
a
little
watery
and
the
carbonation
good
notes
from
122705
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
overall
a
pretty
bland
mix
of
a
hefeweizen
and
a
wit
this
beer
pours
a
semicloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
for
a
wheat
beer
into
a
thin
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
of
orange
peel
lemon
zest
and
tangy
wheat
the
aroma
is
tangy
with
only
hints
of
the
lemon
and
orange
peel
from
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
water
not
what
i
would
expect
from
even
an
american
wheat
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
sweaty
betty
is
a
very
drinkable
wheat
beer
but
its
very
lacking
in
looks
smell
and
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
flavored
with
a
medium
body
md
light
to
medium
bodied
and
a
little
on
the
chewy
side
very
average
wheat
ale
d
all
in
all
this
is
an
alright
beer
but
not
something
id
come
back
to
the
sweet
quality
of
the
taste
is
a
little
to
cloying
but
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
complexity
to
it
d
great
summer
session
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
3
5
drinkability
is
moderate
very
sessionable
but
kind
of
boring
and
uninspiring
drinkability
just
a
light
lightly
sweet
something
wheaty
beer
though
its
a
fine
quaffer
for
hot
summertime
atlanta
drinking
d
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
summer
offering
from
boulder
its
not
the
best
looking
glass
series
beer
but
its
enjoyable
enough
spin
on
a
usually
boring
and
underwhelming
style
drinkability
even
though
it
tastes
a
bit
fair
it
finishes
well
and
leaves
a
good
aftertaste
this
has
actually
become
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
very
drinkable
given
the
style
the
clean
finish
is
very
appealing
in
a
wheat
beer
a
well
made
blondepale
wheat
goes
dwn
easy
and
is
very
enjoyable
sweaty
betty
is
a
nice
little
apwa
that
has
a
definite
hefeweizen
lean
to
it
it
doesnt
have
my
favorite
characteristics
of
the
style
but
is
definitely
one
that
i
will
enjoy
again
a
nice
dark
gold
color
greeted
my
beer
but
not
much
cloudiness
decent
head
that
died
quickly
but
left
a
lace
ring
around
the
mug
weak
smell
did
not
give
me
anticipation
for
this
beer
very
faint
clove
notes
and
smelled
more
like
a
lime
than
lemon
or
orange
peel
or
anything
the
taste
improved
on
the
smell
thankfully
somewhat
a
little
weak
but
a
smooth
mediumbodied
beer
that
had
a
little
sweetness
from
the
wheat
mixed
with
a
decent
punch
of
citric
notes
most
noticeable
was
the
orange
a
little
sharp
in
the
backbite
but
not
bad
a
light
summer
beer
that
isnt
bad
but
not
a
standout
or
anything
d
i
wish
the
carbonation
was
higher
on
this
but
it
is
still
pretty
drinkable
smooth
and
subtle
but
there
is
some
complexity
if
you
look
for
it
an
interesting
and
very
drinkable
beer
should
make
a
nice
beer
for
the
summer
months
for
sure
pour
a
very
light
yellow
stong
aroma
of
mashed
banana
whispy
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
flavor
is
crisp
to
start
slight
citrus
good
carbonation
refreshing
the
end
is
disappointing
as
it
lacks
the
depth
of
flavor
from
other
styles
ive
tried
ill
try
it
again
to
see
if
its
just
my
allergies
messing
with
my
taste
buds
overall
i
think
its
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
cool
artwork
on
the
bottle
d
killer
this
is
a
killer
killer
brew
for
the
summer
i
could
quaff
this
stuff
until
i
puke
not
that
i
would
do
something
like
that
but
i
could
amazing
pour
this
unfiltered
wheat
ale
really
comes
alive
in
your
glass
upend
the
bottle
and
your
eyes
are
givin
a
real
treat
awesome
folds
waves
and
loops
of
sediment
stay
suspended
in
the
beer
and
slowly
settle
out
nice
2
inch
white
head
too
betty
has
a
solid
white
ale
nose
definitely
with
some
belgian
influence
solid
roasty
wheat
flavor
belgian
yeast
and
spicyness
some
banana
and
bland
citrus
notes
above
average
white
ale
body
very
bright
carbonation
this
one
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
and
chewy
a
good
choice
for
the
drinker
who
wants
a
white
ale
with
a
little
bit
of
body
and
decent
character
overall
not
a
bad
summer
beer
however
i
would
have
to
pass
on
trying
it
again
just
not
really
up
my
alley
as
far
as
flavor
nothing
wrong
with
it
though
and
as
far
as
blond
ales
not
half
bad
hv
poured
into
a
wheat
glass
pours
a
yellow
with
a
serious
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
thick
fat
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
summer
sweatyness
with
hints
of
lemon
tweed
earth
and
resin
spicy
grape
taste
hits
the
palate
heavy
carbonation
taste
is
a
bit
toned
down
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
hop
in
there
a
bit
of
acid
and
a
light
taste
of
grapefruit
overall
not
a
bad
offering
but
not
a
great
one
either
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
though
average
at
best
good
carbonation
light
body
nice
beer
i
could
do
a
warm
weather
session
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
but
i
would
drink
again
nice
blonde
d
very
drinkable
in
the
summertime
decent
summer
beer
d
i
could
drink
this
type
of
beer
frequently
it
is
a
very
well
rounded
american
wheat
d
not
bad
a
pretty
light
ale
but
i
bought
this
because
well
also
i
hadnt
had
it
and
couldnt
pass
it
up
as
a
result
im
grilling
this
weekend
and
it
will
be
perfect
for
being
outside
with
friends
its
light
and
refreshing
and
should
make
this
partly
cloudy
day
of
temperatures
in
the
low
80s
a
real
joy
highly
recommended
for
summer
drinking
outside
also
i
feel
like
people
who
arent
into
craft
beer
as
much
could
enjoy
this
one
pretty
easily
heres
to
summer
im
a
sucker
for
wheat
beers
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
could
down
tons
of
these
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
and
has
a
marginal
whitish
head
the
nose
has
some
quiet
citrus
tones
and
wheaty
malts
the
taste
is
mostly
wheat
malts
with
again
subtle
fruit
the
body
is
really
light
for
the
style
and
over
carbonated
needs
lots
of
glass
swirling
to
help
go
down
smooth
this
beer
was
on
sale
which
makes
me
wonder
if
its
old
because
it
poured
out
pretty
flat
with
no
head
hazy
yellow
with
a
small
but
steady
stream
of
tiny
bubble
rising
to
the
surface
i
smell
earthy
clove
funk
and
sour
banana
tastes
as
it
smells
but
a
bit
better
thick
and
somewhat
heavy
mouthfeel
for
the
style
not
the
best
pale
wheat
ive
had
many
better
had
this
beer
at
the
drafting
room
in
exton
pa
great
name
for
a
beer
and
certainly
got
me
to
try
it
as
for
the
taste
it
was
a
wheat
beer
but
it
tasted
water
downed
compared
to
most
i
guess
it
was
the
sweat
from
betty
in
the
beer
would
not
even
bother
trying
d
a
citrusy
and
refreshing
drink
that
slides
effortlessly
off
the
tongue
would
be
on
of
my
top
5
choices
for
a
summer
time
quencher
case
worthy
by
all
means
recommended
hops
did
much
for
the
mouthfeel
which
would
have
been
thin
to
the
point
of
precarious
without
the
ample
hop
complement
had
i
more
time
i
would
have
knocked
back
two
more
of
these
in
a
snap
delicious
and
balanced
sweaty
betty
has
a
harsher
name
than
the
beer
will
ever
realize
its
smooth
semisweet
not
bitter
and
great
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
good
stuff
d
because
of
the
watery
nature
of
the
beer
these
would
be
easy
to
take
down
on
a
hot
summer
night
lacks
in
the
flavor
department
once
again
another
typical
wheat
beer
pours
a
slightly
fogged
straw
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
falls
quickly
nose
is
strange
kind
of
sour
and
weird
flavor
is
strange
too
kind
of
an
odd
banana
edge
that
is
enough
to
notice
but
really
makes
everything
odd
and
unusual
feel
has
a
fairly
full
carbonation
but
the
liquid
is
thin
i
dont
really
like
this
beer
but
i
know
a
lot
of
it
has
to
do
with
my
dislike
of
the
style
said
it
before
saying
it
again
too
thin
on
the
flavor
and
whats
there
just
doesnt
keep
it
interesting
enough
pass
d
the
sournesstartness
and
the
acidity
hurts
the
drinkability
it
is
a
very
light
beer
that
doesnt
have
much
flavor
what
flavor
is
present
is
not
particularly
enjoyable
i
dont
know
if
it
was
just
my
bottle
or
not
but
if
this
is
how
it
always
tastes
i
would
avoid
it
seemed
to
be
an
extra
carbonated
wheat
beer
in
my
mouth
as
for
drinkability
i
live
in
arizona
where
lightweight
beers
are
a
must
in
the
summer
come
on
winter
and
this
one
will
find
a
place
in
my
fridge
from
time
to
time
again
i
just
cant
tell
anyone
im
tasting
sweaty
betty
again
overall
a
thirst
quencher
this
can
replace
gatorade
not
bad
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
extremely
light
yellow
color
and
the
smell
had
a
hint
of
sourness
to
it
the
taste
is
ok
but
there
is
a
subtle
metallic
taste
to
it
it
is
drinkable
but
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
to
try
i
would
only
drink
again
if
it
was
free
what
an
aesthetic
name
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
hazy
watery
golden
color
with
almost
no
head
smell
is
actually
similar
to
a
hefe
there
is
a
slightly
spicy
clovey
banana
presence
taste
is
just
like
the
nose
much
better
than
the
appearance
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
in
both
body
and
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
isnt
perceivable
and
it
goes
down
easily
i
would
recommend
this
beer
d
decent
i
could
have
a
few
on
a
summer
day
but
it
wouldnt
be
a
top
choice
i
will
talk
with
betty
again
soon
to
be
honest
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
attempts
at
the
hefe
weizen
that
ive
come
across
there
isnt
much
of
that
bavarian
flare
to
it
that
makes
the
german
iterations
so
great
but
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
sweetness
and
carbonation
to
make
it
very
enjoyable
notes
of
lemon
honey
and
spices
come
together
nicely
it
is
a
more
classic
take
on
the
pale
wheat
category
and
i
think
boulder
did
a
solid
job
with
it
although
i
found
the
taste
a
little
lacking
this
is
one
of
the
better
summer
beers
and
given
boulders
track
record
id
be
interested
in
trying
this
again
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
stick
with
for
an
evening
especially
if
youre
looking
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
worth
a
case
every
summer
season
ah
the
beauty
of
summer
and
all
the
good
beers
that
comes
with
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
probably
my
favorite
wheat
beer
not
from
a
bar
tap
i
bought
it
at
the
same
time
as
some
samuel
adams
summer
ale
and
while
that
was
good
this
was
just
slightly
better
it
had
a
little
more
of
a
citrusy
taste
which
i
enjoyed
gave
this
brew
a
try
it
poured
to
a
dull
yellow
color
with
some
cloudiness
possessed
virtually
no
head
and
what
was
there
was
a
white
cap
that
broke
down
very
rapidly
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
pretty
good
wheat
scent
comes
out
first
with
a
little
citrus
character
i
would
saw
mostly
lemon
slight
sweet
smell
also
mixed
in
with
a
light
hop
highlight
the
taste
is
ok
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
has
a
grainy
feel
light
hop
presence
but
just
seems
very
plain
finishes
somewhat
dry
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
during
the
warmer
months
but
feel
that
we
have
better
choices
both
nationally
as
well
as
locally
overall
decent
but
nothing
to
actively
pursue
worth
a
try
if
one
comes
your
way
drinkability
grabbed
a
sixer
of
this
because
its
hot
outside
and
this
does
quench
on
a
hot
day
but
like
many
american
wheat
beers
flavor
is
not
overly
complex
or
exciting
at
least
for
me
12oz
brown
bottle
poured
into
my
sly
fox
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
hazy
yellow
color
i
kicked
up
the
yeast
on
purpose
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
smells
of
spicy
yeastbread
bananas
and
clove
tastes
of
said
bananas
peppery
spice
and
a
hint
of
clove
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
dry
and
clean
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
and
not
get
bored
drinkability
overall
a
very
neutral
brew
that
finishes
pretty
clean
first
off
im
not
sure
sweaty
should
ever
be
used
to
describe
something
you
are
planning
to
consume
that
being
said
it
does
make
for
a
rhyming
name
this
beer
poured
a
bright
hazy
yellow
the
head
is
white
and
sparse
the
smell
is
wheaty
the
taste
follows
suit
wheaty
and
bananalike
very
refreshing
and
reminds
me
of
a
hefeweizen
what
is
the
difference
a
wheat
and
a
hefeweizen
anyway
this
is
definitely
a
hefeweizen
so
i
wonder
why
they
call
it
a
blonde
probably
just
to
have
something
go
with
the
name
sweaty
betty
at
any
rate
it
seems
to
have
confused
quite
a
few
reviewers
on
this
site
quite
enjoyable
i
will
have
to
check
out
6pack
prices
because
if
its
cheaper
it
may
replace
summit
as
my
summer
hefeweizen
tasty
a
not
bad
not
exceptional
pale
wheat
that
seems
to
have
wandered
into
boulders
looking
glass
series
by
mistake
fine
to
grab
a
cool
one
of
but
id
pass
on
a
steady
diet
d
this
is
very
drinkable
and
is
a
great
representation
of
the
wheat
beer
style
the
wheat
and
yeast
can
be
tasted
seen
and
felt
but
are
accented
with
citrus
and
some
spices
the
aroma
is
a
little
weak
maybe
light
spicing
wheat
grain
profile
the
flavor
is
much
better
and
significantly
more
full
along
with
some
coriander
spicing
the
wheat
is
more
assertive
pretty
straightforward
blonde
ale
its
not
too
weak
but
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
otherwise
a
solid
brew
i
open
the
bottle
and
pour
eyes
focused
on
the
game
on
this
gloomy
spring
day
the
first
sip
intrigues
me
it
is
wheat
it
is
blonde
it
is
the
fermented
drops
of
bettys
sweat
and
it
tastes
wonderful
golden
like
blonde
locks
wheaty
but
not
overly
fruity
or
citrusy
refreshing
and
i
am
away
from
the
game
dancing
with
the
mysterious
betty
in
fields
of
dandelion
the
6
pack
is
gone
my
team
wins
poured
a
very
hazy
straw
color
with
close
to
a
two
finger
white
head
that
faded
to
just
covering
the
beer
with
a
sticky
lace
that
followed
the
beer
down
the
glass
aromas
of
wheat
and
lemon
grass
and
spice
taste
wheat
malt
lemon
grass
cloves
and
other
spices
with
a
peppery
ending
lingers
for
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
crisp
and
spicy
will
definitely
be
looking
for
more
of
sweaty
betty
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
straw
color

thick
head
the
aroma
is
quite
fruity
and
a
little
sour
the
taste
is
fruity
and
floral
with
some
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
that
is
interesting
and
refreshing
drinkability
a
hidden
gem
this
one
for
an
american
wheat
it
can
compete
with
some
of
the
best
german
hefes
out
there
light
yellow
slightly
cloudy
rapidly
evaporating
head
with
bubbly
carbonation
that
grabs
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
sweet
citrus
and
some
spices
on
the
nose
none
of
which
improve
as
this
beer
warms
up
twangy
lemon
and
orange
offerings
in
the
initial
quaffs
the
body
quickly
reveals
touches
of
hops
and
a
sweet
malt
based
background
there
are
certain
flashes
of
banana
peel
cloves
and
hefelike
spices
with
just
a
touch
of
black
pepper
left
on
the
palate
borderlinemedium
modied
somewhat
of
a
sugary
and
creamy
malt
finish
nothing
that
will
have
you
crying
for
more
but
whos
complaining
about
a
simple
and
easy
to
drink
wheat
ale
d
it
is
pretty
good
i
had
high
expectations
for
a
boulder
beer
product
and
it
didnt
quite
meet
them
but
it
is
still
a
drinakble
beer
bham
uk
but
written
while
in
florida
d
i
could
finish
100
of
these
without
breaking
a
sweat
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
if
you
are
looking
for
a
thirst
quencher
this
may
fit
the
bill
but
the
strong
lemon
and
tartness
gets
a
bit
boring
after
a
while
this
wheat
ale
poured
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
creamy
very
white
foam
that
slowly
settled
and
clung
to
the
glass
leaving
some
lace
the
smell
was
fruity
and
citrusy
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
wheat
malt
beneath
the
taste
was
wheat
malty
with
citrus
fruitiness
and
very
light
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
mediumlight
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
light
fruitiness
lingered
in
the
finish
this
was
a
very
easydrinking
beer
a
good
example
of
the
american
wheat
style
meh
another
plain
jane
pale
wheat
with
a
slight
sourness
unsure
if
this
was
intended
or
if
my
sample
is
beyond
its
life
expectancy
either
way
i
probably
would
have
scored
it
just
the
same
good
summer
cooler
very
clean
and
straightforward
a
true
lawnmower
beer
but
id
like
more
from
this
beer
from
such
a
great
brewery
12oz
bottle
this
one
poured
a
straw
yellow
color
it
was
slightle
hazy
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dropped
off
rather
quickly
faint
whiffs
of
banana
and
clove
to
the
nose
the
body
is
rather
thin
the
flavor
isnt
bad
but
it
is
weak
slight
notes
of
wheat
and
citrus
ok
as
a
lawnmower
beer
but
not
for
any
other
reason
the
name
is
really
unappealing
though
very
drinkable
overall
if
you
are
an
afficianado
of
this
style
no
doubt
you
will
find
that
there
are
better
exemplars
out
there
but
this
a
passable
brew
for
the
dog
days
of
august
on
the
jersey
shore
light
pale
with
fizzy
carbonation
and
almost
no
head
alcohol
and
cheesy
scent
light
bodied
but
drinkable
a
bit
acidic
sour
and
a
metallic
aftertaste
i
even
thought
it
a
tad
skunky
but
apparently
this
is
normal
for
this
beer
terrible
name
i
think
worst
of
the
brewerys
line
d
terrific
refreshing
summer
beer
good
flavor
would
drink
this
again
not
a
big
fan
of
the
name
of
the
beer
however
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
decent
but
theres
nothing
to
write
home
about
here
excellent
hot
weather
brew
ill
definately
grab
more
o
these
next
time
around
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
white
head
over
the
clear
light
golden
brew
head
lasts
nicely
with
heavy
lacing
aroma
is
cloves
and
wheat
character
taste
is
sweet
malts
upfront
with
the
clove
kicking
in
after
a
minute
and
lingering
in
the
mouth
mouthfeel
is
tostyle
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
but
limited
slightly
by
the
possibly
oversweet
start
what
to
give
a
try
on
a
hot
and
humid
day
why
not
sweaty
betty
a
fine
offering
from
boulder
beer
sweaty
betty
pours
a
nice
gold
color
the
rather
pleasant
smell
is
grassy
citrusy
wheaty
the
taste
is
nice
mixture
of
lemoncitrus
wheat
and
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
refreshingly
crisp
a
very
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beverage
is
this
made
by
ab
this
cant
be
a
boulder
beer
no
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
but
it
wasnt
by
any
means
painful
to
drink
that
said
it
rates
higher
on
drinkability
but
most
american
pale
wheats
do
it
would
make
a
pretty
damn
good
summer
sessioner
medium
hops
citrusy
character
light
body
a
great
beer
to
bring
to
the
beach
or
have
at
a
bbq
though
there
are
much
better
options
try
left
hands
haystack
if
you
want
to
stay
in
style
a
pale
wheat
ale
is
probably
not
the
best
style
to
characterize
for
this
beer
the
wheat
never
really
shows
up
the
look
is
quite
clear
and
not
hazzy
the
carbonation
is
fizzy
instead
of
creamy
the
aroma
is
pisnerish
and
grainy
not
estery
and
fruity
the
beer
feels
too
thin
and
the
finish
is
grainy
would
fare
better
as
a
blonde
ale
despite
the
lack
of
wheat
the
beer
keeps
a
persistant
lemon
flavor
and
tartness
that
makes
a
good
summertime
refrehing
beer
though
fizzy
a
mintlike
character
works
in
the
beers
favor
cutting
through
the
thirst
its
a
decent
beer
but
dont
look
for
a
wheat
beer
when
purchasing
this
this
is
a
nicely
amped
up
pale
wheat
ale
its
got
much
more
flavour
than
youd
expect
from
the
style
its
not
the
be
all
end
all
but
a
nice
summer
thirst
quencher
indeed
thanks
go
out
to
heath
for
trucking
me
a
box
of
fresh
co
beers
on
a
recent
east
coast
visit
d
definately
a
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
summers
day
seems
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
almost
reminds
me
of
a
hefe
drinkability
love
to
have
more
but
i
only
have
one
bottle
taste
starts
with
really
clear
malts
with
a
wheat
chaser
finish
a
refreshing
yet
sub
par
blonde
ale
flavor
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
straw
with
an
average
sized
white
head
the
smell
is
very
malty
and
especially
bisquity
other
smells
include
lemon
and
wheat
this
is
a
pretty
good
smelling
beer
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
with
lemon
wheat
yeast
and
a
creamy
citrus
flavor
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
a
very
good
summer
beer
i
can
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
a
flavorful
pale
wheat
compared
to
the
onslaught
of
boring
summer
releases
too
heavy
on
the
lemonsourness
but
one
i
would
go
back
to
this
is
a
decent
summer
brew
a
good
change
from
most
of
the
boring
summer
brews
out
there
refreshing
enough
and
the
taste
is
good
its
just
what
id
expect
from
a
summertime
wheat
beer
sassy
crisp
snappy
and
refreshing
it
may
not
stand
out
in
the
memory
but
it
represents
itself
nicely
while
youre
drinking
it
its
very
quaffable
staying
light
and
quenching
a
thirst
capably
i
got
a
kick
out
of
the
name
and
hey
the
beers
not
bad
either
i
thought
that
a
beer
from
boulder
would
have
a
bolder
no
pun
or
alliteration
intended
side
to
it
and
would
show
off
the
amarillo
hops
that
characterize
them
and
make
them
stand
out
from
other
brews
in
that
part
of
the
country
this
could
have
used
just
a
bit
of
that
to
liven
things
up
and
make
it
more
memorable
instead
they
made
a
light
enjoyable
brew
but
the
memory
of
it
is
just
like
the
taste
it
doesnt
linger
well
and
hardly
stands
out
among
the
competition
certainly
a
missed
opportunity
i
felt
this
was
a
great
hefe
i
had
this
beer
after
a
weekend
of
backpacking
my
mind
was
quite
numb
and
my
notes
on
this
beer
were
sparse
im
sure
it
deserves
more
description
than
i
can
decipher
from
my
notes
this
ones
a
dead
ringer
for
a
bavarian
weitzen
well
done
sweaty
betty
blonde
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
aroma
is
banana
and
clove
very
light
wheat
beer
taste
clove
is
noticeable
but
mild
at
first
but
becomes
more
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
a
bit
of
citrus
perhaps
sort
of
a
sparkling
type
of
carbonation
decent
beer
for
a
hot
day
worth
a
try
pours
an
opaque
lemon
yellow
with
a
14
inch
creamy
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
citrusy
and
spicy
taste
is
banana
cloves
as
one
would
expect
from
this
style
hints
of
pepper
as
well
carbonation
is
slightly
stinging
but
not
inappropriate
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
after
working
your
butt
off

mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
light
body
the
beer
has

the
beer
is
an
ok
beer
drink
however
for
the
money
it
is
easy
to
get
a
better
wheat
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
wispy
white
head
that
disappears
after
about
a
minute
nice
crisp
aroma
of
light
wheat
citrus
banana
and
weizen
yeast
palate
is
fairly
standard
for
a
wheat
beer
light
wheat
and
citrus
flavors
with
banana
and
bubble
gum
esters
present
in
the
background
body
is
a
bit
thin
and
not
particularly
wellcarbonated
not
bad
but
im
glad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
of
this
the
beer
pours
forth
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the

a
slightly
chill
hazed
straw
color
the

smallish

quite
dry

not
a

beer
hits
the
spot
on
this
hot
arizona
day
didnt
really
go
down
that
easy
too
much
going
on
with
out
any
rhyme
or
reason
d
moderate
a
little
to
lemonysour
for
me
but
a
quality
brew
poured
a
lemon
orange
with
a
cloudy
body
that
leaves
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
lemon
pepper
orange
zest
very
nice
and
complex
the
taste
starts
malty
wheat
with
a
candied
fruit
body
that
is
slighty
carbonated
and
slighty
thin
the
beer
finishes
light
with
gentle
bubble
and
a
spicy
sweetness
on
your
tongue
draft
at
the
angry
mexican
aka
mad
mex
in
robinson
any
way
i
was
expecting
a
blonde
from
boulder
when
i
heard
sweatty
betty
nope
i
was
wrong
appears
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
wow
impressive
appearance
the
billowing
head
dwindles
slowly
leaving
even
bands
of
lacing
aromatics
com
packed
with
citrus
tones
sharp
wheat
acidity
soft
vanilla
and
other
herbal
spices
but
the
hops
also
stand
out
here
with
a
spicy
finish
tastes
very
well
balanced
yet
packing
abundant
flavor
light
and
fluffy
citrus
and
wheat
sweetness
with
a
softer
vanilla
fruity
tone
and
finishes
with
a
nice
hop
bite
well
done
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
evenly
carbonated
no
harshness
here
at
very
smooth
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
great
a
very
refreshing
summertime
offering
that
puts
the
typical
american
pale
wheat
to
shame
good
job
to
the
folks
out
at
boulder
brewing
dvery
easy
to
drink
beer
excellent
warmer
weather
beer
sweaty
betty
you
go
down
easy
for
all
of
that
i
wish
you
gave
better
head
youre
leaving
the
bottom
of
my
glass
bald
i
dont
mind
bald
but
not
on
my
beer
feels
substantial
enough
to
be
satisfying
but
not
so
flavorful
that
youd
wince
at
every
sip
while
tipping
back
at
a
bbq
good
especially
for
the
style
one
of
the
more
complex
american
wheats
ive
had
the
wheat
sourness
and
vague
spiciness
leans
towards
a
witbier
some
aspects
are
more
bavarian
hefeweiss
and
others
are
american
wheat
a
nice
little
hybrid
you
are
betty
da
very
good
wheat
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
more
would
be
welcomed
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
for
by
the
pool
but
as
i
review
this
on
129in
mn
and
look
outside
there
is
a
thick
layer
of
ice
on
my
pool
i
can
dream
though
cant
i
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
some
carbonation
small
head
some
lacing
scents
of
citrus
and
wheat
nice
taste
for
a
wheat
ale
dry
but
kinda
flat
light
body
very
drinkable
for
sure
not
too
sure
about
the
abv
nice
taste
would
recommend
but
will
probably
not
buy
again
you
could
drink
cases
of
this
stuff
in
the
summer
and
get
pretty
damn
drunk
doing
so
a
summer
offering
thats
worth
a
try
if
you
find
it
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
head
disapears
quickly
to
a
nice
lace
this
beer
is
a
lighter
version
of
flying
dogs
in
heat
wheat
i
like
the
flying
dog
a
bit
betterbut
this
is
not
bad
at
all
in
fact
on
a
hot
day
i
may
go
for
this
because
it
is
lighter
from
notes
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
wit
ha
small
head
that
fell
to
nothing
at
all
over
the
brew
the
nose
was
orangey
nd
lemony
with
light
wheaty
notes
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
rather
bland
just
nota
lot
going
on
in
that
one
at
all
the
feel
was
light
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
impressions
were
nothing
of
note
a
fairly
average
brew
pedestrian
this
one
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
reminds
me
a
lot
of
an
american
wheat
some
us
hops
and
a
backing
of
wheat
and
graininess
the
flavor
is
just
as
expected
reminds
me
of
an
american
wheat
just
like
the
aroma
not
my
favorite
style
but
the
flavor
on
this
one
is
better
than
most
more
smooth
than
expected
the
body
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
good
im
not
so
sure
this
one
is
retired
since
i
just
got
it
on
tap
from
old
chicago
yesterday
but
oh
well
this
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
haze
with
a
quickly
dissolving
head
and
a
little
lace
smells
of
mostly
lemon
citrus
and
seems
to
taste
that
way
to
i
was
not
to
thrilled
with
this
beer
but
not
let
down
it
was
just
average
an
unusual
wheat
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
isnt
afraid
to
have
some
fun
gotta
love
the
name
and
the
label
design
and
blurb
are
amusing
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
hefe
head
mild
banana
aroma
that
was
equally
evident
in
the
flavor
some
tangy
citric
qualities
lend
a
more
american
spin
to
this
wheat
very
refreshing
a
bit
lighterweight
than
a
german
hefe
and
meant
to
be
so
few
hefes
are
good
session
beers
but
this
is
one
where
one
is
not
enough
a
medium
bodied
ale
ok
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
or
repeat
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
such
as
this
another
fine
offering
from
boulder
a
nice
addition
to
the
lineup
an
ok
to
seldomly
enjoyable
beer
not
much
to
it
just
not
cutting
it
for
me
as
any
kind
of
wheat
beer
this
brew
would
probably
go
great
with
gourmet
pizza
or
at
a
barbeque
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
on
its
own
but
i
really
didnt
i
wish
they
spent
more
time
thinking
about
what
they
were
brewing
instead
of
coming
up
with
fancy
names
and
labels
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
witha
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
fruity
wheat
scent
that
boasts
of
banana
and
clove
along
with
a
yeasty
aroma
very
refreshing
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
light
wheat
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
its
smooth
with
the
traditional
banana
and
clove
appeal
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
summer
seasonal
it
has
a
nice
fruity
flavor
i
wish
it
had
more
of
a
wheat
malt
presence
but
it
drinks
well
anyway
cloudy
sun
yellow
thin
white
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lace
this
ones
good
on
the
nostrils
lemon
citron
tangy
wheat
hay
very
pleasant
not
as
much
to
talk
about
on
the
buds
though
still
decent
enough
but
the
lively
tones
on
the
nose
dont
translate
to
the
palate
dulled
wheat
tones
and
a
little
lemongrass
just
a
little
spritz
of
hops
that
give
the
beer
a
slightly
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
not
quite
as
active
as
id
like
in
a
wheat
brew
but
not
a
lot
else
to
complain
about
body
is
a
little
better
than
medium
this
ones
not
too
bad
id
hit
it
up
again
overall
i
love
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
style
but
this
one
just
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
to
hold
up
to
the
better
examples
pleasant
enough
to
drink
but
there
are
much
better
choices
appearance
is
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
quarter
inch
of
foam
and
no
lacing
aroma
has
spicy
hops
barley
but
not
much
malt
initial
taste
is
of
banana
esters
citrus
grain
and
some
pretty
interesting
hops
body
is
medium
and
finish
is
dry
not
a
great
ale
more
of
a
wheat
beer
this
one
pours
a
very
cloudy
yellowish
tone
white
head
with
morerate
retention
and
next
to
no
lacing
the
nose
here
is
of
heavy
clove
on
the
tongue
its
more
strong
cloves
some
buting
cirtic
notes
and
some
soft
tropical
fruits
in
the
background
this
one
is
quite
tart
and
leaves
an
allmost
stinging
bite
on
the
tongue
not
my
favorite
wheat
type
brew
needs
to
be
softened
up
less
clove
notes
would
be
a
start
it
should
be
easy
to
find
better
drinking
summer
brews
uf
this
was
mild
easy
drinking
and
not
too
exciting
it
was
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
looking
glass
series
of
beers
sweaty
betty
is
the
first
one
that
hasnt
bowled
me
over
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
i
havent
had
a
good
time
with
it
its
flavorful
and
oh
so
drinkable
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
bomber
is
empty
and
the
glass
is
rapidly
heading
in
that
direction
sweaty
might
be
pushing
it
but
then
mildy
moist
betty
doesnt
have
much
shelf
appeal
drinkability
unfortunately
there
are
many
other
seasonals
i
want
to
try
yet
that
this
will
have
to
compete
with
later
as
summer
winds
down
if
i
see
this
on
sale
i
would
probably
pick
some
more
up
i
just
am
not
going
to
go
rush
out
and
get
more
right
away
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
the
style
is
a
bit
watery
for
my
tastes
and
this
beer
does
seem
a
tad
watery
give
it
a
try
anyway
it
would
be
very
refreshing
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
and
fizzy
but
lasting
white
head
no
lacing
to
be
found
the
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
along
with
mild
hops
lightbodied
and
bubbly
with
fruit
and
wheat
flavors
kind
of
a
watery
texture
too
the
finish
is
short
and
lemony
i
am
against
any
beer
that
makes
reference
to
something
secreted
from
the
human
body
even
without
that
this
is
a
below
average
beer
a
very
light
yellowstraw
colored
beer
has
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
starts
with
a
strong
yeasty
note
with
the
wheat
and
banana
notes
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
like
a
mild
version
of
a
hefe
but
there
is
an
unpleasant
corn
on
the
cob
sweetness
that
lays
in
the
back
of
your
throat
on
the
finish
my
final
bottle
from
the
six
pack
and
it
opened
with
a
flow
of
foamy
beer
unlike
its
brothers
that
were
lost
before
it
nicy
cloudy
dark
gold
color
head
is
small
after
the
initial
pour
nice
strong
banana
and
clove
smell
pretty
solid
for
the
style
the
taste
is
a
little
bland
but
still
good
with
alot
of
tart
banana
flavor
pretty
good
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
i
have
yet
to
find
a
beer
in
the
looking
glass
series
that
wasnt
interesting
another
looking
glass
series
beer
now
it
comes
in
six
packs
moslty
clear
greenish
gold
color
with
a
very
white
head
that
reduces
to
a
collar
pretty
quickly
lace
is
minimal
at
best
aroma
of
dusty
hay
with
some
cotton
candy
sweetness
solid
mouthfeel
with
minimal
carbonation
which
helps
the
estery
qualities
shine
candy
circus
peanut
impressions
distinct
vanilla
tone
seems
to
dominate
mid
mouth
like
cream
of
wheat
with
sugar
and
bananas
on
top
sucrose
finish
not
a
lot
of
complexities
and
without
a
lot
of
citrus
notes
to
cut
in
theres
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
is
an
american
wheat
with
a
hefty
dose
of
that
grain
tossed
in
im
starting
to
get
warm
on
the
name
now
too
sweaty
or
not
bettys
my
kind
of
girl
overall
impression
i
had
this
beer
last
spring
and
wasnt
too
impressed
i
feel
like
they
may
have
changed
the
recipe
slightly
or
maybe
my
tastes
changed
but
i
enjoyed
it
this
time
poured
a
light
somewhat
cloudy
yellow
with
minimal
head
and
no
lacing
smells
like
bananas
and
fruit
and
tastes
very
much
like
the
banana
smell
very
light
and
refreshing
beer
and
very
enjoyable
nice
change
of
pace
at
the
end
of
your
95
day
ok
so
it
doesnt
have
the
label
hefeweizen
in
the
name
anywhere
when
i
tried
this
beer
that
is
definitely
what
i
thought
it
was
it
poured
a
pale
golden
yellow
and
was
certainly
unfiltered
there
was
no
head
to
speak
of
and
very
little
lace
that
didnt
stay
around
anyway
very
slight
aroma
of
vanilla
and
banana
the
taste
has
the
banana
and
a
little
more
citrus
no
clove
flavor
that
you
might
expect
from
a
highquality
hefe
i
give
this
beer
credit
though
it
had
none
of
the
chemical
aftertaste
that
many
american
hefeweizens
are
full
of
why
is
that
a
very
light
mouth
feel
nice
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
hot
weather
beer
on
a
90
degree
boston
day
hazy
pale
gold
in
hue
kind
of
pasty
yet
it
was
still
surprisingly
transparent
not
much
animation
either
it
looks
a
bit
lifeless
the
head
was
white
in
color
and
about
a
finger
in
height
on
a
hard
pour
head
retention
was
poor
as
it
quickly
faded
to
a
loose
cap
for
a
hefeweizen
these
features
are
not
up
to
par
as
the
head
was
too
small
and
the
retention
was
to
short
the
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
and
it
didnt
cling
well
yet
another
dull
aspect
of
the
appearance
the
nose
is
soft
with
musty
notes
being
the
most
noticeable
yeasty
weak
banana
aromas
as
well
hint
of
vanilla
wheaty
there
is
a
faded
indication
of
citrus
at
the
back
the
nose
does
play
along
with
the
idea
that
this
is
a
hefeweizen
im
not
totally
convinced
maybe
id
call
it
a
kicked
up
american
wheat
then
again
i
havent
tasted
it
yet
this
is
solely
based
on
the
look
and
smell
the
bouquet
is
inviting
regardless
the
palate
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
upfront
is
a
meshing
of
yeasty
musk
with
some
wheaty
notes
in
the
middle
the
banana

a
way
to

are

in

modest

malty

thickly
wheaty
pleasantly
sweet
the
aftertaste
is
mostly
banana
with
just
a
trace
of
clove
this
is
a
zesty
and
quite
tasty
hefeweizen
with
an
american
twist
still
the
palate
has
now
conviced
me
this
was
german
roots
the
carbonation
is
lively
as
desired
tasty
bring

the
pancakes

medium
in

the
mouthfeel
is
quite
pleasant
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
yet
another
dandy
from
the
looking
glass
series
this
is
enjoyable
enough
that
i
might
have
to
buy
a
few
more
bombers
purchased
in
omaha
fresh
subtle
solid
and
refreshing
wheat
beer
an
americanized

also

small

with
a
strange
slightly
harsh

grip
up

i
am
not
impressed
with
this
beer
too
many
conflicting
flavors
and
tastes
with
little
direction
or
focus
no
need
to
look
for
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
orange
yellow
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
no
lacing

of
wheat
bananas

spices
flavors
of

bubblegum
flavors
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
almost
flat

i
was
disappointed
with
this
maybe
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
slightly
hazy
nearly
opaque
golden
yellow
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
copper
the
white
head
was
tiny
even
after
a
hard
pour
little
lacing
smell
is
wheaty
and
pleasant
with
slight
hints
of
banana
and
lemon
taste
is
sweet
lots
of
the
wheat
flavor
just
a
small
hint
of
bitterness
and
lemon
this
is
right
up
there
next
to
paulaner
hefeweizen
this
one
isnt
quite
as
fruity
as
paulaners
is
but
absolutely
great
the
taste
was
acidic
at
first
then
went
with
an
alcohol
flavor
which
didnt
impress
me
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
heavier
than
i
expected
it
has
a
wonderful
wheaty
aftertaste
which
lingers
nicely
all
in
all
a
good
brew
didnt
like
it
so
much
at
first
gulp
but
from
there
ive
grown
to
like
the
taste
a
bit
more
ill
plan
to
stock
the
fridge
with
a
few
more
before
it
disappears
i
was
extremely
impressed
by
this
beer
definitely
need
to
snag
a
few
more
while
they
are
still
available
this
years
summer
sessions
is
my
favorite
summer
beer
for
2014
overall
breweries
just
love
to
crank
out
these
wheat
beers
in
the
summer
its
a
nice
entry
though
it
doesnt
separate
itself
from
the
pack
much
other
than
the
organic
tag
i
had
it
with
pizza
and
salad
i
would
have
it
with
pizza
and
salad
again
probably
o
one
of
the
better
hoppy
wheats
ive
tried
overall
pretty
solid
summer
brew
ill
revisit
this
one
again
in
the
near
future
o
took
a
chance
on
this
one
and
i
couldnt
be
happier
this
is
a
very
solid
fridge
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
getting
it
again
this
may
even
top
trout
slayer
ale
as
my
favorite
wheat
beer
would
pair
very
nicely
with
white
fish
a
nice
first
impression
from
peak
organic
i
will
have
to
seek
out
more
of
their
offerings
cheers
this
wont
blow
anyones
mind
but
its
good
for
a
summer
afternoon
for
sure
summer
session
very
much
like
an
apa
very
hoppy
got
3
or
them
in
a
beer
of
the
month
pack
will
enjoy
them
i
never
have
heard
of
peak
organic
brewing
company
but
i
definitely
would
recommend
someone
with
access
to
this
to
try
if
you
enjoy
this
style
o
i
do
not
like
the
yeast
profile
on
this
at
all
way
too
buttery
o
decent
pale
wheat
good
mild
hop
presence
and
not
too
much
on
the
wheat
balanced
if
po
could
get
that
soapy
aftertaste
out
this
would
be
something
id
return
to
o
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
hot
day
and
it
tasted
great
after
a
walk
in
the
heat
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
piss
colored
and
poured
a
nice
fluffy
head
the
beer
was
a
little
bit
hoppy
with
a
citrus
hint
to
it
the
beer
had
a
tiny
bitter
finish
but
not
too
bad
and
had
great
lacing
i
would
drink
again
overall
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
because
i
usually
dont
go
for
the
imo
bland
summer
beers
i
was
hoping
for
something
that
is
easy
to
drink
without
sacrificing
complex
flavor
and
hoppiness
this
one
is
right
on
the
money
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
in
the
mood
for
a
session
with
character
o
very
impressed
by
this
offering
whenever
i
see
summer
beers
the
word
lame
automatically
pops
into
my
head
this
beer
is
a
true
pale
ale
and
is
light
enough
for
the
summer
this
is
the
epitome
of
what
i
want
to
drink
for
the
season
o
a
slightly
aboveaverage
summer
pale
wheat
has
quite
a
bit
going
on
despite
a
nice
simplicity
easy
to
drink
organic
and
not
too
expensive
worthy
of
a
try
its
1045
should
i
have
one
overall
while
i
found
the
twelve
ounces
agreeable
but
i
wonder
where
it
finds
a
home
at
its
not
overly
wheaty
and
the
hops
are
somewhat
muted
by
the
diacetyl
character
at
least
in
this
batch
so
i
do
wonder
who
is
this
for
i
could
see
this
being
replaced
sometime
down
the
road
an
all
right
pale
wheat
ale
i
suppose
with
lip
service
being
paid
to
that
west
coast
hop
essence
which
altogether
makes
for
a
whole
is
better
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
sort
of
deal
refreshing
enough
and
worthy
of
a
few
more
go
rounds
i
must
admit
on
tap
at
burger

tasting
notes
overall
meh
not
much
of
a
wheat
beer
at
all
more
like
a
macro
so
called
wheat
more
like
candy
cereal
grains
with
a
bit
of
fruit
more
leinenkugel
like
wheat
beer
than
a
real
wheat
the
hops
are
decent
though
which
might
be
the
saving
grace
of
this
beer
its
light
and
drinkable
for
a
summer
beer
though
so
definitely
sessionable
but
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
and
after
all
that
there
really
arent
any
off
flavors
just
not
the
best
overall
flavors
for
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
definitely
asadvertised
a
great
summer
session
ale
it
also
happens
to
suit
my
palate
quite
nicely
id
definitely
have
this
again
peak
organic
summer
session
ale
is
a
very
clear
golden
ale
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
has
great
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
very
earthy
smell
with
a
fresh
hop
aroma
thats
bright
and
citrusy
it
smells
great
its
medium
light
bodied
smooth
and
soft
the
finish
is
quick
and
dry
leaving
the
mouth
a
little
slick
it
has
a
nice
tight
dry
bitter
flavor
with
lots
of
lemon
peel
and
a
hint
of
grass
and
herbs
the
bitterness
lingers
for
a
while
after
the
taste
this
beer
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
it
has
a
lot
more
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
and
its
very
refreshing
im
a
fan
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
slightly
hazed
vibrant
bright
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
slim
filmy
white
coating
on
the
surface
aromas
of
toasted
grains
and
a
surprising
hops
presence
bitter
and
slightly
resiny
on
the
nose
which
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
flavors
are
definitely
hopcentric
with
a
green
peppery
bitter
influence
overshadowing
a
subtle
toasted
grain
backbone
a
little
unbalanced
on
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
light
crisp
and
clean
with
some
citrus
influence
on
the
green
hops
characteristics
crisp
light
and
slightly
drying
finish
very
tasty
o
one
the
better
examples
of
the
style
done
organically
cool
overall
i
may
just
get
this
again
organic
ales
kick
ass
o
this
drinks
like
a
lightened
version
of
little
sumpin
sumpin
big
hops
flavor
with
the
wheaty
tanginess
tone
down
the
carbonation
by
20
and
peak
would
have
a
real
winner
as
springsummer
beers
go
this
is
a
cant
miss
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
brew
probably
my
favorite
summer
beer
the
aroma
is
loaded
with
bright
citrus
hop
character
up
front
then
a
rush
of
nice
wheat
flavor
contrasting
the
hops
really
well
finishes
dry
and
clean
nice
carbonation
i
could
have
many
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
and
appreciate
the
taste
of
each
one
a
gem
decent
beer
i
would
drink
during
the
summer
in
small
amounts
d
glad
i
only
got
one
of
these
not
a
terrible
beer
but
definently
below
my
expectations
5
as
the
overall
yes
when
its
hot
out
when
im
working
up
a
sweat
i
want
a
flavorful
beer
that
refreshes
me
rejuvenates
me
keeps
me
going
but
still
tingles
my
taste
buds
this
is
exactly
what
peak
organics
summer
session
ale
and
i
encourage
you
to
reach
for
one
this
summer
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
very
high
visible
carbonation
the
aroma
has
clean
malts
wheat
hops
and
citrus
the
taste
is
good
its
got
a
nice
citrus
and
wheat
presence
at
first
dying
down
to
some
clean
malts
toasted
grain
a
touch
of
hops
and
still
continuing
citrus
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
heavily
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
just
a
really
good
american
wheat
its
very
flavorful
for
its
small
profile
delicious
o
decent
sessionable
summer
ale
for
what
its
worth
i
might
have
this
again
o
a
decent
session
ale
bready
some
citrus
and
peppercorn
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
o
its
certainly
not
gumballhead
but
its
a
tasty
little
number
in
its
own
right
not
as
complex
or
hoppy
as
id
have
liked
yet
its
something
you
could
bring
to
a
party
and
not
offend
anyone
id
prefer
more
complexity
but
in
the
end
its
still
quaffable
and
easily
approachable
sampled
from
a
bottle
at
the
april

2012
keene
nh
beerfest
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
shortlived
head
the
aroma
has
a
moderate
malt
character
but
there
is
also
a
citrus
or
more
likely
a
pineapple
character
the
wheat
is
playing
second
fiddle
the
body
is
light
which
is
typical
for
the
style
the
taste
also
brings
out
the
same
sort
of
light
malt
citrus
flavor
with
an
extra
tart
finish
winding
things
down
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
a
nice
dry
and
lemony
pale
ale
that
fits
the
label
of
summer
session
ale
o
very
refreshing
a
good
summer
beer
peak
organic
brews
some
very
good
beers
and
this
is
one
i
will
look
for
this
one
again

has
some

a
mild

finish
certainly
a
step
up
from
other
summer
ales
and
quite
refreshing
but
not
overly
complex
definitely
above
average
though
and
so
far
ive
liked
every
single
thing
i
tried
from
peak
organic
picked
up
a
single
at
euromarket
for
such
a
light
beer
the
ringwood
creamy
earthy
fruit
character
is
too
heavy
there
is
however
a
pleasant
fruity
citrus
burst
that
remind
me
of
citra
hops
and
narragansett
summer
ale
the
hops
are
complemented
by
a
mild
sweet
wheat
bread
the
body
is
appropriately
light
and
drinkable
for
sessionsummer
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
ringwood
beers
o
a
decent
summer
ale
that
actually
tastes
like
beer
hoppy
and
refreshing
notes
the
mild
buttery
taste
i
picked
up
was
a
tad
distracting
but
this
is
nitpicking
it
isnt
enough
to
detract
from
the
overall
drinking
experience
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
tasty
too
you
cant
really
ask
for
much
more
from
a
summer
seasonal
all
in
all
pretty
enjoyable
for
a
summer
brew
solid
flavors
interesting
malt
profile
and
all
around
good
beer
id
pick
up
a
sixer
if
it
was
local
for
sure
d
it
is
a
pure
summer
beer
refreshing
and
lagers
not
happy
or
pure
malty
very
good
balance
taste
is
crisp
nice
bitter
touch
to
finish
fairly
crisp
like
a
pilsner
a
perfect
summer
session
beer
aptly
named
reminds
me
a
bit
of
new
belgium
mighty
arrow
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
yellow
with
plenty
of
head
and
generous
lacing
strong
malt
and
sweet
wheat
aroma
leads
to
a
concentrated
grain
taste
some
burnt
malts
balanced
by
light
bitterness
very
easy
drinking
perfect
carbonation
gets
you
in
the
mood
for
a
baseball
game
session
is
the
perfect
description
for
this
summer
brew
crisp
and
light
bodied
with
a
decent
balance
of
bready
yeast
earthy
hops
peppery
spice
and
citrus
rind
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
none
of
the
flavors
stand
out
or
are
particularly
strong
a
well
balanced
quaffable
session
beer
that
is
good
for
bbq
and
outdoor
drinking
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
light
and
pretty
drinable
it
makes
for
a
very
good
summer
beer
and
went
well
with
the
pasta
i
paired
with
it
d
im
quite
impressed
with
this
one
and
even
a
little
bit
surprised
at
how
nice
it
is
this
beer
is
much
better
than
average
both
as
a
summer
beer
and
an
american
wheat
ale
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
complex
as
spices
and
a
very
nice
lemon
zest
character
hit
your
in
the
nose
along
with
a
hint
of
pine
hops
the
flavor
profile
operates
along
the
same
lines
with
the
addition
of
vanilla
and
some
more
potent
malt
really
well
done
and
very
drinkable
i
continue
to
be
impressed
with
peak
as
they
are
making
beers
that
stand
up
for
themselves
regardless
of
their
organic
status
pouring
a
clear
light
orangeyellow
with
a
dense
white
head
that
falls
off
leaving
no
lacing
this
beer
looks
decent
the
nose
is
decent
as
well
moderate
hop
character
fruity
and
citrusy
with
a
rather
clean
crackerlike
malt
backbone
grainy
with
a
moderate
dry
wheat
aroma
theres
not
too
much
going
on
here
the
palate
opens
with
some
hop
flavor
moderately
citruslike
rather
mild
in
flavor
theres
no
real
bitterness
here
and
even
the
hops
taste
a
little
muted
moderate
grain
flavor
is
present
with
a
definite
wheat
presence
drying
on
the
finish
with
no
real
lingering
flavors
this
feels
just
a
touch
watery
crisply
carbonated
this
is
a
refreshing
beverage
though
not
particularly
tasty
summer
session
ale
is
a
solid
beer
that
doesnt
quite
stand
out
from
the
crowd
more
hops
would
have
been
nice
making
this
a
hoppedup
wheat
beer
less
hops
and
a
focus
on
the
malted
wheat
might
have
been
better
too
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
and
refreshing
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
a
subtle
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
it
has
a
mild
bitterness
and
well
as
a
faint
citrus
character
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
brew
with
incredible
drinkability
a
fine
summer
seasonal
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
its
a
good
selection
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
as
a
pairing
with
a
light
dish
like
pasta
really
a
nice
light
body
here
with
good
lively
carbonation
really
a
refreshing
beer
here
it
really
sums
up
what
i
would
want
out
of
a
lighter
summer
beer
poured
into
a
standard

vt
d
i
definitely
plan
on
drinking
this
beer
again
this
summer
in
place
of
my
slightly
heavier
goto
beer
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
ive
already
recommended
this
beer
to
a
few
friends
and
its
definitely
a
bonus
in
my
book
that
its
organic
d
very
drinkable
beer
nice
moderate
abv
with
refreshing
flavors
a
really
good
summer
sessionable
ale
like
the
name
says
md
light
body
sparkling
carbonation
finishes
with
a
dry
resiny
smack
will
have
this
again
d
a
delicious
summer
beer
i
would
definitely
have
another
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
it
might
not
be
the
best
beer
out
there
but
its
still
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
the
taste
is
light
refreshing
a
true
summer
ale
the
lemony
tartness
is
most
noticeable
with
some
sweetish
malts
and
wheatiness
coming
through
things
dry
up
a
bit
in
the
finish
there
is
not
much
aftertaste
for
better
or
worse
the
texture
is
a
touch
course
but
only
a
touch
due
to
the
wheat
but
not
mouth
prickly
it
isnt
a
smooth
beer
but
neither
is
it
particularly
rough
the
herbal
lemony
flavors
are
pretty
much
what
defines
this
beer
there
is
a
slightly
drying
leafy
hop
pepperiness
in
the
finish
and
that
keeps
things
a
bit
interesting
too
id
come
back
for
another
if
it
means
anything
i
had
this
after
a
very
boozy
dipa
and
this
really
cleansed
the
palate
points
added
right
there
d
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
ive
had
refreshing
fruity
wheaty
just
awesome
drinkability
is
this
beers
strong
point
plenty
of
flavor
but
the
crisp
dry
finish
leaves
you
salivating
for
the
next
sip
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
summer
beers
but
this
one
is
nice
overall
a
great
surprise
i
think
its
welldone
for
the
style
im
not
too
high
on
releases
from
this
brewery
as
they
have
been
somewhat
lackluster
in
the
past
however
this
would
not
be
out
of
place
on
a
hot
day
this
one
is
easy
drinking
with
some
nice
complexity
and
bonus
points
for
being
organic
easily
one
of
the
best
overall
summer
session
brews
ive
had
whether
or
not
this
is
a
session
ale
at
5
it
is
delicious
and
light
for
summertime
drinking
and
still
packed
with
flavor
overall
decent
beer
with
some
nice
flavors
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
as
there
are
many
many
better
summer
beers
out
there
im
not
getting
it
again
on
my
own
im
generally
a
fan
of
the
shipyard
line
and
while
im
not
as
down
on
this
one
as
the
bros
i
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
less
inspired
offerings
from
shipyard
just
blah
and
a
bit
harsh
and
metallic
on
the
palate
picked
up
a
12pack
on
sale
about
a
buck
a
bottle
and
still
cant
say
id
buy
more
even
at
that
price
you
cant
get
a
better
summer
ale
then
this
an
extremely
plain
and
almost
flavorless
summer
beer
which
is
odd
because
it
has
more
body
than
it
needs
to
with
this
little
flavor
brassy
color
a
little
dull
looking
from
the
bottle
but
holding
a
decent
white
head
and
leaving
some
patchy
froth
lacing
as
i
drink
it
down
very
quickly
the
best
feature
is
the
feel
great
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
but
thats
expected
because
there
isnt
much
flavor
to
clean
up
a
really
mild
two
row
malt
base
is
basically
irrelevant
and
the
hops
are
for
balance
only
no
real
flavor
to
them
the
thing
i
taste
the
most
is
the
yeast
which
is
a
clean
and
very
basic
ale
yeast
i
think
more
grain
profile
not
body
on
this
beer
would
make
it
a
little
better
but
its
good
for
mindless
summer
drinking
i
much
prefer
it
with
spicy
food
can
cleanse
the
palate
pretty
will
without
getting
too
filling
nothing
special
though
overall
from
shipyard
they
save
their
magic
for
the
signature
series
o
more
crafty
than
craft
overall
decent
summer
beer
very
simple
not
too
crazy
about
the
ringwood
yeast
too
o
not
a
bad
summer
brew
very
similar
to
the
saranac
kolsch
i
had
recently
and
some
of
the
same
observations
apply
more
body
than
many
lagers
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
distinctive
flavor
except
for
initial
tartness
i
did
not
get
the
lemon
flavor
others
have
reported
overall
its
not
a
sipper
if
you
didnt
know
that
when
you
bought
it
youre
a
bit
of
a
stooge
its
a
really
good
summer
session
ale
for
pool
parties
cookouts
watching
ballgames
beaching
etc
theres
a
reason
the
label
has
a
picture
of
a
lounging
lobster
on
it
overall
an
ok
summer
ale
its
pretty
easy
drinking
and
nonoffensive
a
brew
that
most
anyone
would
drink
making
it
good
for
large
summer
style
gatherings
it
didnt
stink
but
not
exactly
memorable
it
was
a
gift
who
i
am
not
to
drink
a
gifted
six
pack
unfortunately
the
best
thing
this
guy
had
going
for
it
was
its
label
definitely
did
the
wrong
kind
of
judging
a
book
by
its
cover
on
this
one
in
my
opinion
its
still
a
touch
underrated
crisp
light
flavor
without
much
fruit
or
anything
else
going
on
its
not
bland
and
the
flavor
is
fine
best
when
bought
cheaply
at
an
end
of
season
sale
at
bootleggers
the
wheat
does
add
a
slight
bit
of
character
to
this
pale
ale
which
might
otherwise
taste
like
a
standard
pale
or
pilsener
a
low
to
moderate
hop
bite
at
the
end
i
think
it
is
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
ok
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
nothing
really
offensive
about
this
beer
either
o
not
a
bad
summer
option
at
all
but
not
a
must
have
summer
option
either
my
pour
garnered
a
finger
of
dense
rocky
eggnogcolored
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
amber
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
distinct
wheat
tang
and
a
lemoncitrus
bite
no
i
did
not
squeeze
a
slice
of
lemon
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
and
the
taste
was
very
tangy
from
the
wheat
i
can
understand
why
the
uninitiated
might
want
to
cut
the
flavor
but
it
also
speaks
to
the
refreshing
nature
of
the
beer
finish
was
quite
dry
not
gasping
like
some
aipas
but
more
like
applying
alum
to
the
tongue
literally
drying
not
bad
at
all
im
sure
this
american
pale
wheat
goes
way
better
with
a
lobster
roll
eating
in
portland
me
but
here
it
goes
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
formed
thick
with
fine
bubbles
carbonation
levels
seem
kicked
up
a
bit
by
the
amount
of
head
im
getting
in
this
glass
but
the
fine
speckled
lacing
is
patterned
around
my
wheat
beer
glass
evenly
aromatics
im
getting
a
light
sharp
wheat
character
a
hint
of
lemon
citrus
peel
and
some
grain
maybe
even
a
light
biscuit
malt
expression
pretty
muted
so
far
flavor
has
a
whirl
wind
of
yeast
characteristics
im
guessing
this
is
their
house
yeast
fermentation
set
up
with
one
of
the
alan
pugsley
systems
im
getting
earthiness
a
bit
of
oak
with
a
mild
light
bodied
summer
ale
as
the
backbone
base
beer
a
touch
of
citrus
and
bitterness
that
comes
of
as
grassy
but
overall
a
really
lackluster
beer
experience
on
flavor
and
if
you
dont
care
for
their
house
yeast
watch
out
it
has
a
bite
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
even
lively
carbonation
flow
with
a
lingering
bitterness
mainly
from
the
yeast
pitch
here
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
its
quite
refreshing
and
like
i
stated
before
im
sure
i
would
be
guzzling
a
couple
of
these
on
tap
when
in
rome
aka
chowing
one
some
fresh
seafood
in
maine
shipyard
summer
ale
is
a
very
sparkling
clear
golden
ale
topped
with
a
thin
dense
off
white
head
that
has
super
retention
and
lacing
light
wheat
and
lemon
are
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
banana
it
smells
grainy
and
perhaps
corny
it
has
a
smooth
light
body
with
a
dry
crunchy
finish
it
makes
my
teeth
feel
dirty
along
with
the
lemony
twang
of
wheat
there
is
a
rumbling
green
bitterness
it
gets
herbal
and
a
little
minty
toward
the
finish
it
leaves
a
phenolic
taste
in
the
mouth
its
a
little
ragged
but
not
that
hard
to
drink
83b
just
ok
just
below
average
overall
im
not
a
big
summer
ale
guy
but
when
in
the
mood
there
are
much
better
offerings
out
there
sam

at

with
a
half
inch
of

that
leaves
some
lacing
smell
is
ring
wood
yeast
biscuit
lemon
and
wheat
taste
what
you
would
expect
from
the
smell
pretty
strait
forward
body
is
medium
for
the
style
plenty
of
carbonation
not
dry
and
easy
going
down
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
easy
drinking
summer
beer
sure
this
could
be
a
session
beer
on
taste
alone
but
in
this
case
i
wish
i
could
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
lawnmower
beers
are
a
dime
a
dozen
and
this
easily
fell
into
the
category
of
that
while
its
not
worth
passing
up
dont
buy
this
and
expect
an
apa
this
is
beer
in
the
most
generic
sense
of
the
word
o
well
i
thought
i
liked
this
beer
before
but
realized
this
wasnt
as
good
as
i
thought
it
could
have
just
been
a
bad
brew
however
i
looked
at
the
bottle
and
it
said
it
doesnt
expire
until
november
2012
i
may
have
to
rereview
this
or
try
it
on
tap
somewhere
overall
some
off
flavors
detract
from
what
should
be
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
it
would
make
for
a
good
selection
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
ive
learned
not
to
expect
too
much
from
apas
but
shipyards
summer
ale
just
doesnt
have
the
basic
elements
needed
to
make
a
good
apa
o
meh
id
rather
drink
bmc
lagers
than
this
i
assume
its
old
being
a
summer
ale
and
all
but
they
were
still
selling
them
poured
a
2
white
head
clear
straw
yellow
color
body
smells
mildly
of
malt
taste
is
a
mix
of
mild
malt
weak
spice
and
a
faint
acidity
better
than
an
average
bmc
but
still
only
slightly
acceptable
for
a
summer
ale
on
a
hot
summer
day
bonus
points
for
the
label
with
the
lobster
drinking
beer
on
the
beach
my
opinion
its
a
beer
thats
been
placed
in
bottle
with
a
kitschy
label
that
represents
everything
that
maine
is
to
a
tourist
lobster
ships
ocean
nautical
flags
etc
so
i
think
its
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
from
the
bottle
while
on
vacation
in
maine
and
not
much
else
well
the
worst
thing
about
the
mouthfeel
is
that
the
taste
is
on
your
tongue
otherwise
its
a
relatively
light
body
with
ample
carbonation
overall
this
isnt
good
grab
a
narragansette
or
at
least
a
sam
over
this
guy
lots
of
better
summer
offerings
out
there
overall
shipyard
has
many
choices
but
most
of
these
are
mediocre
however
i
think
the
grading
of
this
one
has
taken
a
hit
by
their
reputation
as
it
is
actually
a
standard
summer
ale
i
have
to
call
not
really
good
on
this
if
its
summer
in
maine
i
think
i
am
going
for
vacationland
beer
from
grittys
instead
o
this
wasnt
really
a
great
pale
ale
there
was
an
odd
mustiness
that
didnt
work
for
me
was
building
a
mixed
sixer
at
a
grocery
store
near
me
wound
up
with
five
brews
i
wanted
this
is
the
sixth
beer
this
beer
pours
a
fairly
clear
highly
carbonated
pale
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
goes
away
the
aroma
is
highly
sweet
and
buttery
probably
partially
owing
to
the
ringwood
yeast
the
taste
is
pretty
good
its
sweet
and
grainy
with
that
little
hint
of
butter
in
the
background
which
actually
works
quite
well
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
that
comes
in
for
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
very
crisp
and
thirstquenching
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
overall
an
enjoyable
brew
if
unexceptional
i
found
it
fairly
interesting
to
drink
a
beer
where
the
buttery
taste
was
actually
intentional
and
worked
well
with
the
flavor
profile
but
ymmv
pale
yellow
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
and
taste
are
similar
to
a
german
pilsner
with
the
skunky
odor
and
taste
there
is
not
much
to
say
about
it
except
that
if
you
like
german
pilsners
you
will
like
this
if
not
you
wont
for
me
personally
i
woudlnt
recommend
or
purchase
again
i
shrugged
this
down
to
be
a
polite
guest
but
this
is
a
terrible
summer
beer
yuck
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
pale
goldenyellow
coloring
with
a
decent
one
and
a
half
inch
fluffy
offwhite
colored
head
at
first
the
head
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
layer
of
offwhite
head
that
is
filmy
tons
of
bubbles
throughout
this
brew
looks
very
watery
aromas
are
smokey
and
roasted
with
a
banana
fruit
sweetness
and
buttery
character
to
it
reminds
me
of
banana
bread
a
bit
but
lighter
flavors
are
slightly
sour
and
bitter
on
the
edges
but
overly
sweet
and
cloying
throughout
the
roasted
cereal
flavor
is
underlying
on
the
midtongue
but
the
fruity
and
sweet
backbone
is
muddled
making
the
beer
poorly
balanced
throughout
aftertaste
is
mostly
roast
and
semisweet
caramel
with
a
lingering
slightly
bitter
and
tangy
finish
there
are
worse
things
you
could
drink
out
there
this
summer
but
not
many
overall
not
a
bad
brew
and
interesting
to
taste
o
hey
buddy
ive
had
one
of
them
before
tell
me
your
opinion
overall
saw
this
on
tap
at
a
local
pub
and
thought
id
give
it
shot
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
it
lacks
both
character
and
flavor
there
are
much
better
examples
both
regionally
harpoon
and
nationally
sam
adams
readily
available
pours
a
deep
gold
decent
head
that
goes
away
quickly
no
lacing
smell
is
extremely
mild
not
much
taste
is
also
very
mild
a
bit
of
white
grape
and
citrus
little
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
slightly
sweet
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
a
pretty
good
summer
ale
very
refreshing
and
light
poured
a
yelloworange
colour
with
no
head
none
it
smells
sort
of
like
citrus
and
peach
with
a
little
bit
of
an
herbal
undertone
the
taste
is
pretty
typical
of
a
summer
ale
its
very
citrusy
and
tastes
kind
of
like
cloves
or
coriander
im
not
sure
which
but
thats
pretty
much
what
comprises
the
spicy
notes
nothing
special
really
its
very
light
in
flavour
and
body
as
a
summer
ale
should
be
so
thats
right
on
its
refreshing
ill
give
it
that
im
not
a
big
fan
of
that
corianderclove
taste
though
never
have
been
pale
yellow
but
clear
and
bubbly
head
is
about
a
14
high
but
drops
to
nothing
nose
is
grassy
with
a
background
of
sour
lemon
and
malt
taste
is
thin
and
crisp
with
a
buttery
biscuit
malt
body
and
a
quick
hit
of
fruity
hops
that
dry
out
fast
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
but
with
a
lot
of
the
biscuit
malt
lingering
the
definition
of
average
but
i
enjoy
it
do
an
easy
summer
drinker
with
a
decent
abv
doesnt
try
too
hard
at
being
a
hoppy
apa
but
balances
the
malts
and
hops
nicely
cheers
summer
beers
have
a
weird
way
of
being
just
too
light
on
all
levels
this
pale
ale
could
have
probably
used
just
a
little
bit
more
in
the
mash
or
just
less
water
i
say
this
because
i
that
most
people
who
are
willing
to
try
this
beer
want
something
better
than
average
this
brew
falls
under
par
for
me
because
its
too
much
like
a
generic
run
of
the
mill
ale
from
a
major
brewery
yellow
clear
and
light
bodied
wasnt
very
impressive
gold
clear
and
fizzy
white
head
that
topped
the
yellowness
slightly
longer
than
expected
grainy
touch
of
metallicness
but
theres
a
slight
perfumefloral
aroma
as
well
rather
bland
in
flavor
save
for
a
light
metallic
twang
and
cereal
grain
should
have
been
served
a
bit
colder
youll
probably
never
hear
me
say
that
again
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
wheat
and
grain
along
with
some
flowers
perfume
and
hairspray
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
grain
corn
and
some
floral
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
given
as
a
gift
from
the
father
as
part
of
a
mixed
pack
feels
a
little
out
of
season
to
be
drinking
on
a
summer
ale
on
a
chilly
night
but
ah
what
the
hell
pours
a
nice
bubbly
gold
kind
of
bmc
looking
but
the
big
head
saves
it
light
bodied
very
thin
on
the
palette
get
some
lemon
zest
type
of
flavors
a
bit
of
euro
hop
taste
to
it
finishes
nice
and
clean
super
drinkable
yeah
it
could
be
a
little
tastier
but
it
is
what
is
is
a
super
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
lackluster
summer
ale
it
is
more
of
an
american
pale
wheat
it
is
far
from
an
apa
an
okay
beer
watered
down
and
thin
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
a
step
down
from
sam
summer
sorry
guys
being
a
brewer
who
is
not
a
hop
head
my
opinion
is
tainted
towards
malty
brews
i
liked
it
it
was
clean
crisp
lightly
hopped
bought
only
one
in
a
sample
pack
i
will
be
heading
back
to
the
abc
store
to
buy
more
before
it
vanishes
along
with
summer
d
for
a
pale
ale
i
get
almost
no
pale
malts
and
very
little
hop
character
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
adjunct
beer
definitely
no
a
summer
beer
id
have
again
average
for
the
lack
of
complexity
somethings
not
working
here
but
i
cant
say
for
sure
what
that
is
still
its
a
beer
and
not
terrible
there
are
better
but
this
was
sessionable
even
its
not
the
worst
summer
ale
ive
had
but
far
from
the
best
your
average
ne
summer
ale
from
shipyard
the
flavor
is
all
about
the
infamous
interesting
and
bazaar
house
yeast
its
too
dominating
in
this
style
sometimes
it
works
the
wormwwood
yeast
is
fine
in
the
bluefin
stout
and
some
others
but
in
this
delicate
style
it
just
doesnt
work
it
seemd
way
too
malty
with
buttered
bread
and
honey
that
is
too
cloying
and
relaxed
the
yeast
does
not
provide
a
criapy
snap
and
also
a
rather
funky
aftertaste
its
just
not
clean
enough
for
a
simple
summer
brew
and
there
are
so
very
nice
summer
brews
out
there
sorry
guys
i
just
cannot
finish
this
one
taste
is
ok
but
the
fruitiness
from
their
house
yeast
is
just
too
much
for
me
im
really
not
a
fan
of
it
at
all
i
cant
say
its
too
bad
theres
a
light
honey
sweetness
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
it
feels
watery
and
leaves
a
slight
coat
there
isnt
much
carbonation
to
be
felt
expected
more
from
shipyard
but
like
a
maine
summer
it
was
confused
and
not
sure
what
it
wanted
to
be
drinkability
light
bodied
rather
bitter
the
taste
of
this
beer
leaves
much
to
be
desired
refreshing
like
a
summer
ale
should
be
overall
i
think
this
is
a
tasty
and
totally
refreshing
brew
welldone
shipyard
b
drinkability
sorry
shipyard
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
not
exactly
the
best
use
of
1
99
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
malts
taste
is
good
a
bit
sweet
malts
with
a
touch
of
citrus
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
d
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
it
is
not
something
that
i
would
purchase
again
ehh
picked
up
a
twelve
pack
for
13
for
a
saturday
evening
bbq
at
my
house
with
friends
poured
mine
into
a
standard
pint
glass
clear
yellow
body
looks
like
a
macro
large
white
head
formed
but
immediately
disappeared
no
lacing
at
all
on
glass
smell
was
nonexistent
nothing
on
the
nose
taste
was
below
average
reminded
me
a
mediocre
euro
lager
had
a
slightly
skunky
flavor
not
enough
to
be
offensive
just
enough
to
notice
very
boring
on
the
palate
could
not
taste
any
hops
not
much
body
at
all
i
will
rate
the
drinkability
as
average
and
not
below
because
the
beer
is
not
horrible
that
said
there
are
so
many
more
local
summer
ales
on
the
market
that
are
better
than
shipyard
would
not
purchase
this
again
did
i
just
get
a
skunk
here
the
bitterness
is
almost
cleaning
solutionesque
it
is
weird
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
as
long
as
this
bottle
isnt
an
anomaly
pretty
bland
and
forgettable
all
around
drinkability
ok
i
will
drink
it
again
couldnt
beat
the
price
i
got
it
for
free
its
an
ok
summer
beer
not
a
beer
to
sip
or
taste
with
buddies
just
drink
until
you
are
not
thirsty
anymore
overall
i
was
a
bit
suspect
buying
a
summer
beer
in
late
september
however
the
bottle
had
a
date
saying
it
was
best
before
oct
i
would
not
enjoy
running
across
this
beer
after
the
bestby
date
overall
better
than
a
macro
but
there
are
certainly
better
summer
ales
out
there
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
1
finger
of
bubbly
sudsy
head
to
it
head
recedes
quickly
leaving
thin
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
muted
notes
of
yeast
malts
and
some
extremely
mild
citrus
taste
is
of
grains
and
malts
predominantly
a
touch
of
citrus
zest
to
it
for
the
most
part
it
is
a
bit
bland
light
bodied
medium
carbonations
somewhat
watery
and
thin
to
it
crisp
and
slight
dry
finish
this
is
a
beer
that
on
a
hot
summer
day
could
down
down
pretty
quickly
but
there
is
nothing
of
note
to
it
decent
drinkablity
for
a
summer
ale
but
with
average
qualities
bottom
line
not
really
worth
it
overall
the
worst
summer
beer
ive
ever
had
due
to
the
oddly
heavy
body
buttery
stale
taste
and
high
carbonation
poured
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
1
finger
of
thin
foam
over
orangeamber
clear
beer
good
refreshing
smell
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
refreshing
taste
that
invites
gulps
nice
long
finish
that
is
very
pleasant
very
drinkable
sitting
here
on
the
backporch
in
july
just
another
averageesc
summer
ale
but
as
most
on
this
site
really
dislike
it
it
has
something
about
it
that
i
find
easy
to
put
back
i
like
the
bisquit
notes
the
mildly
sweet
malt
component
and
the
light
touch
of
citric
hop
it
is
a
good
summer
slammer
it
really
says
maine
not
including
allagash
and
all
the
other
great
ones
in
meas
it
is
in
the
style
i
often
find
here
uncomplicated
and
not
overly
complex
but
generally
fresh
and
easy
to
knock
back
im
probably
the
only
one
on
this
site
that
will
try
it
again
perhaps
with
a
lobstah
roll
next
time
im
up
d
not
horrible
not
great
feels
a
little
heavy
to
chug
and
not
thirst
quenching
enough
to
be
a
great
summer
beer
drinkability
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
not
overpowering
but
it
has
more
than
a
little
taste
to
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
34
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
wheat
yeast
and
pale
malt
does
not
really
fit
the
style
of
an
american
pale
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
sweet
malt
pale
malt
wheat
and
slight
hops
overall
a
decent
blonde
ale
maybe
but
not
a
pale
ale
at
all
drinkability
more
like
a
lager
than
an
ale
to
be
honest
both
in
looks
as
well
as
in
flavour
and
scent
and
with
that
style
in
mind
its
still
not
impressing
d
wow
this
is
likely
the
worst
summer
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
stale
harsh
and
totally
lacking
in
character
on
tap
in
portland
me
poured
with
barely
any
head
at
all
an
orangeyellow
color
that
was
slightly
hazy
average
carbonation
aroma
seemed
to
have
hints
of
orange
light
body
that
was
smooth
on
the
palate
very
easy
to
drink
didnt
taste
wheaty
at
all
some
are
claiming
its
a
wheat
beer
but
it
seemed
like
a
pretty
good
deck
beer
on
a
summer
day
with
a
very
short
finish
pours
pale
golden
with
white
head
nose
is
somewhat
weak
with
a
light
lemony
cereal
grain
profile
on
the
palate
this
comes
across
like
a
macro
lager
with
that
cereal
grain
malt
flavor
light
hops
slight
herbal
and
overall
light
bodied
easy
drinking
but
not
much
to
savor
d
a
bland
beer
to
me
which
i
woul
buy
if
there
were
nothing
else
interesting
available
but
i
was
not
impress
and
would
probably
pass
to
be
honest
d
goes
down
easy
no
real
citrus
or
spice
that
you
might
expect
from
a
summer
wheat
beer
good
carbonation
almost
fizzy
in
the
mouth
flavor
is
really
plain
a
liitle
wheaty
malt
and
hops
again
no
real
summer
wheat
spark
not
sure
what
they
were
going
for
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
any
of
your
friends
who
like
bud
or
miller
could
certainly
drink
this
one
nice
for
hot
summer
days
but
i
wont
look
for
it
again
found
on
tap
at
the
fox
ridge
golf
course
while
in
maine
this
brew
shows
a
light
orange
yellow
color
clear
with
a
thin
white
whispy
head
and
fair
lacing
the
aroma
is
tart
citrus
wheat
and
apple
not
too
strong
but
decent
the
taste
a
nice
citrus
dry
hop
bite
with
a
blend
of
wheat
and
ginger
spice
light
feel
but
for
the
style
its
very
reasonable
with
a
solid
fine
carbonation
for
a
very
refreshing
and
relatively
tasty
summer
brew
well
done
if
you
like
some
bitter
hop
while
sipping
a
lighter
beer
and
very
drinkable
of
course
pretty
much
an
average
summer
ale
the
color
when
poured
was
medium
golden
with
an
orange
hue
the
smell
of
sweet
malts
and
citrus
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
was
a
zesy
yeast
and
citrus
nature
not
unpleasant
in
the
taste
but
refreshing
i
would
say
its
an
average
to
slighty
above
average
summer
ale
pleasant
quincher
on
hot
day
or
just
sitting
around
chewing
the
fat
with
friends
a
mild
and
somewhat
reserved
ale
might
be
a
hit
on
hot
summer
days
though
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
will
probably
never
buy
it
again
i
probably
wouldnt
be
inclined
to
get
it
again
or
order
it
on
draft
unless
the
malts
proved
to
be
a
bit
smoother
or
the
ale
dedicated
itself
to
being
more
hoppy
or
citrusy
im
beginning
to
have
my
reservations
about
shipyard
brews
as
theyre
proving
to
underwhealm
me
quite
often
drinkability
nothing
really
jumps
out
about
this
beer
for
an
apa
the
hops
are
not
really
there
i
could
drink
this
again
after
cutting
the
grassor
i
could
just
as
easily
reach
for
water
it
is
a
step
above
macro
is
not
bad
but
moreso
just
blah
note
abv
is
48
according
to
the
label
overall
an
interesting
summer
beer
that
was
certainly
worth
the
purcahse
in
my
case
nothing
so
special
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
the
mouth
feel
was
really
smooth
it
was
quite
a
treat
to
have
it
come
to
the
feel
of
the
ale
drinkability
overall
i
didnt
hate
it
but
its
got
loads
of
issues
that
need
to
be
corrected
i
think
if
the
lemony
bite
was
smoothed
out
and
the
toasted
element
i
got
was
maximized
this
could
be
a
decent
sessioner
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
lowered
alot
as
well
it
made
the
beer
almost
unbearable
to
finish
glad
i
only
bought
a
bottle
of
this
or
i
would
have
been
very
disapointed
d
nice
light
and
clean
beer
that
goes
well
with
the
name
drinkability
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
summertime
refresher
alcohol
is
never
detectable
i
look
forward
to
more
summers
drinking
this
beer
twist
off
cap
smells
refreshing
spices
and
malt
pours
to
a
pale
yellow
with
a
medium
bubble
head
but
it
doesnt
hold
up
long
taste
is
malty
with
subdued
hoppiness
that
shows
up
a
little
more
in
the
finish
carbonation
is
a
little
high
upon
further
review
the
brew
tends
to
be
a
little
more
bitter
than
sweet
throughout
with
some
spice
in
the
background
a
good
refreshing
beer
with
no
complexity
but
solid
taste
im
not
sure
if
this
is
really
a
hot
weather
brew
but
then
again
how
hot
does
it
get
in
the
summer
in
maine
overall
id
say
this
beer
is
smooth
and
mediumbodied
and
it
contains
a
rather
very
sharp
hop
bite
unfortunately
it
is
a
little
too
sharp
and
cuts
through
the
beer
and
gives
off
a
pungent
bitter
feeling
that
corrals
a
rather
standard
summer
ale
not
a
bad
summer
seasonal
but
there
definitely
better
ones
out
there
the
beer
poured
with
a
clear
pale
yellow
appearance
with
some
nice
lacing
and
a
thin
head
aromas
were
really
odd
and
out
of
place
very
weak
citrus
with
a
really
yeasty
texture
somewhat
metallic
hints
as
well
just
very
off
and
imbalanced
taste
is
similar
strong
metallic
aftertaste
with
bittersalty
flavoring
no
real
biscuity
aspects
and
very
minor
citrus
mouthfeel
is
quenching
and
refreshing
a
little
watery
though
overall
really
unbalanced
drink
drinkability
is
high
on
this
beer
because
of
the
great
wheat
taste
in
this
there
is
not
a
great
amount
of
hop
taste
to
this
beer
but
that
makes
it
more
drinkable
on
a
warm

ok
ive
now
tried
quite
a
few
shipyard
selections
theyre
easy
to
get
here
with
various
styles
and
i
think
its
safe
to
say
im
not
really
a
fan
of
this
brewery
thinking
back
i
cant
think
of
one
beer
from
them
i
thought
was
really
good
and
only
a
few
that
were
in
the
averagegood
range
brown
ale
ipa
this
one
unfortunately
is
no
different
golden
colored
decent
sized
white
foamy
head
little
lacing
malty
aroma
with
a
sweet
malty
caramel
taste
this
isnt
really
even
that
refreshing
didnt
even
like
it
on
the
golf
course
and
thats
saying
something
d
i
really
hope
that
this
beer
doesnt
always
taste
like
this
but
form
reading
other
reviews
it
still
doesnt
seem
very
impressive
im
not
a
fan
of
seltzer
water
update
july
2009
i
still
like
the
beer
it
is
a
little
less
creamy
than
i
originally
pegged
it
a
bit
too
carbonated
to
be
a
kolsch
style
so
scrub
that
possibility
this
is
a
solid
a
touch
grassy
a
touch
lemony
refreshing
summer
ale
there
is
a
slight
tartness
in
the
finish
maybe
a
touch
prickly
in
the
mouth
you
cant
go
wrong
here
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
variation
in
amearican
wheats
based
on
the
handful
i
have
sampled
this
style
has
slowly
grown
on
me
and
i
take
them
for
what
they
are
worth
and
that
is
satisfying
good
malty
and
grainy
aroma
light
amber
in
color
thin
white
head
good
lacing
and
steady
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
par
and
the
flavor
is
solid
i
do
like
what
wheat
does
for
an
ale
its
simple
and
relatively
subtle
but
it
works
well
good
solid
example
here
and
there
is
a
hint
of
the
buttery
flavor
in
the
finish
that
is
common
with
their
blonde
ale
d
definitely
not
session
material
or
one
i
would
bother
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
bit
dry
tart
and
not
really
smooth
on
the
swallow
couldnt
recommend
this
in
good
judgement
d
a
decent
summer
quencher
with
some
interesting
elements
would
work
for
me
at
a
bbq
however
overcarbonation
would
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
drink
too
many
notes
not
something
i
would
ever
try
again
a
let
down
and
although
it
was
drinkable
i
kept
wishing
i
had
bought
a
brooklyn
summer
ale
instead
despite
my
review
i
have
had
a
lot
worse
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
less
than
ordinary
beer
and
wouldnt
be
the
first
one
that
id
pick
not
recommended
at
all
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
smells
metallic
with
a
slight
hint
of
malt
again
tastes
metallic
from
the
start
you
start
to
pick
up
some
floral
notes
and
hops
but
the
metallic
taste
stay
with
you
to
the
end
quite
smooth
despite
the
poor
taste
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
not
my
pint
of
beer
but
sure
to
please
some
of
those
looking
for
a
lighttasting
beer
this
summer
dit
doesnt
go
down
too
smooth
but
it
does
have
some
good
flavor
to
an
extent
this
isnt
something
i
would
think
about
purchasing
at
a
bar
in
the
future
or
even
in
a
case
it
was
nice
to
have
just
for
the
collection
not
the
best
summer
seasonal
out
there
in
fact
seems
a
bit
weak
compared
to
the
competition
as
well
as
other
shipyard
brews
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
golden
color
into
my
favorite
pint
glass
with
decent
initial
head
formation
that
thins
out
rather
quickly
its
nose
has
a
breadyeast
smell
with
a
slight
hop
aroma
i
find
this
beer
to
be
very
light
but
it
has
a
decent
malt
flavor
and
subtle
hop
balance
unfortunately
the
carbonation
level
is
a
little
too
high
for
my
taste
but
in
an
odd
way
it
adds
a
nice
creamy
finish
to
the
beer
i
think
that
this
is
an
adequate
representation
of
a
summer
beer
and
would
definitely
not
turn
one
down
if
offered
in
the
future
d
i
could
knock
these
back
all
day
cheers
solid
summer
beer
its
hard
to
find
summer
beers
i
enjoy
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
nose
is
a
bit
malty
with
no
other
discernable
qualities
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
nicely
balanced
between
malts
and
hops
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
and
is
decently
carbonated
and
goes
across
the
palate
nicely
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
have
had
this
twice
at
tailgates
and
this
brew
does
quite
well
in
a
warm
weather
session
ok
but
not
much
else
overall
i
have
to
admit
i
have
never
really
been
a
huge
fan
of
anything
from
shipyard
they
just
always
seem
to
come
off
a
bit
bland
to
me
this
one
however
was
quite
nice
it
had
a
great
feel
to
it
and
really
the
punch
at
the
end
of
it
really
seemed
to
make
the
difference
i
really
enjoyed
some
of
the
fruit
tones
that
were
present
throughout
and
thought
it
had
a
nice
sessionable
characteristic
to
it
overall
i
would
not
say
this
was
a
favorite
of
mine
however
it
was
not
too
bad
at
all
will
probably
get
me
to
try
another
one
or
two
from
them
down
the
road
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
traces
of
lace
clear
amber
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
citrus
nose
flavor
is
citrusy
sweet
but
slight
hoppy
finish
best
by
oct
2007
1
50
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capitol
convenience
concord
nh
pours
golden
with
a
bit
of
white
head
the
smell
is
just
a
hint
of
flowers
and
sweet
malt
taste
isnt
overpowering
but
a
nice
clean
floral
finish
this
is
an
ok
summer
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
if
their
was
nothing
else
in
the
fridge
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
what
throws
me
off
is
the
summer
ale
name
to
me
i
would
drink
this
more
as
a
fallwinter
brew
was
looking
forward
to
this
beer
but
something
about
it
is
not
sitting
right
with
me
very
average
beer
at
best
pours
a
clear
looking
orangeamber
color
with
a
decent
slightly
offwhite
head
nothing
special
but
it
does
leave
some
trace
lace
elements
the
aroma
is
faintly
floral
but
is
weak
at
best
also
some
light
fruit
and
malt
characteristics
but
again
nothing
special
the
taste
is
crisp
and
provides
some
refreshment
on
this
hot
summer
day
but
this
beer
has
very
little
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
some
distant
fruitiness
maybe
some
apple
or
pear
but
its
too
hard
to
tell
but
it
finishes
with
a
rather
unpleasant
alcohol
flavoring
so
very
unimpressive
here
the
mouthfeel
isnt
terrible
relatively
smooth
with
a
nice
dry
finish
but
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
both
at
times
not
there
and
just
not
very
good
id
be
willing
to
give
this
another
try
down
the
road
but
only
in
a
different
format
or
settingon
tap
at
the
brewery
perhaps
or
maybe
next
years
recipe
will
be
different
this
summer
ale
leaves
much
to
be
desired
nice
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
ive
never
been
a
big
fan
of
shipyard
but
this
is
pretty
good
give
it
a
try
though
summer
is
great
for
all
the
wheat
and
summer
ales
and
here
is
another
one
pours
an
highly
carbonated
amber
with
a
great
head
that
is
constantly
replenished
good
looking
beer
aroma
is
a
biscuity
malt
with
a
slice
of
lemon
and
an
unwelcome
metallic
astringent
characteristic
that
brings
down
the
beer
taste
is
not
much
better
dry
and
malty
but
metallic
there
are
just
so
many
better
summer
ales
sam
adams
anchor
out
there
or
hefe
weizens
any
from
germany
that
you
should
probably
take
a
pass
on
this
one
not
awful
but
forgettable
this
was
nice
an
enjoyable
ale
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
was
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
shipyard
beers
ive
tried
this
would
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
as
well
as
pair
with
any
standard
grilled
fare
recommended
and
i
will
enjoy
more
of
this
while
the
sun
is
high
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
fluffy
head
not
much
retention
and
just
a
bit
of
lacing
lots
of
bubbles
smell
is
breadywith
fruit
undertones
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
spicy
and
bready
with
some
citrus
tastes
more
like
a
kolsch
than
and
apa
not
really
a
summer
ale
taste
either
but
not
bad
for
whatever
it
is
although
im
reviewing
this
beer
im
not
sure
its
the
right
one
mine
has
a
very
different
label
and
the
beer
does
not
fit
the
style
of
an
apa
however
the
beer
would
be
a
very
good
blonde
or
a
bold
kolsch
but
for
an
apa
the
brew
is
undermalted
underhopped
and
has
no
amber
colors
or
caramel
notes
the
beer
does
have
a
very
firm
bready
pilsner
flavor
and
texture
with
ligth
citrus
spiciness
and
a
hint
of
lemons
pears
earthy
yeasty
flavors
and
a
solid
texture
that
lends
smoothness
and
an
airy
feel
nice
beer
but
not
a
pale
ale
pours
a
nearly
clear
gold
color
with
hints
of
amber
and
about
1
finger
of
white
head
and
some
very
spotty
lacing
smells
of
biscuity
malts
with
some
malt
sweetness
taste
is
first
of
biscuity
malts
then
sweet
malts
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
average
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
moderate
carbonation
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
beer
is
slightly
below
par
the
aroma
is
in
some
way
offputting
its
a
bit
difficult
to
describe
but
it
certainly
lessens
the
drinking
experience
besides
the
aroma
this
beer
is
just
average
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
with
limited
retention
aroma
of
weak
malt
with
some
yeast
taste
of
weak
wheat
malt
is
overall
quite
boring
with
again
a
weird
and
off
taste
of
yeast
coming
through
light
hops
at
the
end
provide
a
dry
aftertaste
definitely
boring
for
a
style
that
doesnt
produce
much
in
term
of
great
beers
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
an
average
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quick
leaving
no
lacing
not
much
smell
maybe
a
bit
grassy
the
taste
is
more
pronounced
i
can
detect
a
hint
of
hops
lemon
and
some
buttery
notes
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
finishes
a
little
sour
not
a
bad
summer
ale
but
not
one
the
impresses
i
cant
say
that
many
summers
do
not
enough
hop
flavor
for
a
respectable
apa
maybe
masked
by
the
lemon
this
brew
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
thats
notably
hazy
the
head
is
slim
and
simple
the
aroma
is
composed
of
a
slight
malt
sweetness
and
faint
herbal
hops
theres
a
bit
of
yeast
and
grain
but
not
much
else
the
taste
begins
mildly
sweet
then
dries
out
by
the
finish
theres
a
malt
and
grain
flavor
and
just
a
bit
of
hops
modest
carbonation
and
quite
light
body
for
a
summer
beer
this
one
has
a
more
pronounced
hop
profile
than
most
i
certainly
liked
that
aspect
of
the
beer
but
unfortunately
theres
little
else
to
praise
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
forgettable
and
unremarkable
beer
the
drinkability
is
good
a
great
pick
me
up
on
a
warm
day
prosit
mk
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
about
an
inch
white
head
it
smells
like
grain
and
a
bit
of
citrusy
hops
it
has
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
lemon
and
also
a
weird
hoppy
sour
taste
pops
in
there
too
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
and
slick
but
also
smooth
the
drinkability
isnt
too
bad
overall
i
think
its
an
average
beer
id
drink
it
again
if
someone
gave
me
one
but
i
wouldnt
buy
one
unless
i
didnt
have
a
better
choice
available
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
lager
than
an
apa
pours
an
orangishyellow
color
with
little
head
or
retention
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
has
an
unusual
scent
to
it
that
i
cant
quite
describe
but
i
dont
i
like
it
the
taste
is
kind
of
bland
not
as
much
flavor
to
it
as
comparable
beers
fairly
hoppy
feels
crisp
and
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
correct
amount
of
carbonation
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
just
not
typical
of
a
summer
there
are
better
summers
out
there
drinkability
you
will
have
to
enjoy
the
ringwoodinduced
butterscotch
complement
to
the
wheat
and
hops
notes
that
otherwise
characterize
this
beer
unfortunately
i
dont
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
and
very
good
for
a
summer
ale
overall
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
but
if
it
comes
your
way
its
worth
a
try
beer
poured
out
with
about
a
14
head
which
disappeared
pretty
quickly
has
a
nice
amber
color
but
a
very
nice
carbonation
which
remained
high
till
the
last
drink
smell
gave
a
good
mild
hoppy
odor
the
beer
went
down
very
smooth
with
very
mild
hops
taste
and
light
mouthfeel
a
nice
beer
for
a
summer
night
a
firm
and
frothy
halfinch
head
gives
way
pretty
quickly
the
color
is
pale
straw
with
a
huge
contingent
of
bubbles
dancing
to
the
surface
the
scent
is
clean
and
dry
upon
the
first
taste
a
good
hop
bite
spreads
through
the
mouth
and
leaves
just
a
touch
of
malt
at
the
end
a
crisp
and
light
very
drinkable
beer
without
very
much
complexity
very
nice
and
smooth
summer
drink
went
well
with
a
summer
evening
and
light
food
would
enjoy
another
if
the
sixer
didnt
disappear
so
fast
d
goes
down
very
easy
notes
this
is
far
from
your
typical
summer
grainy
light
brew
it
ends
up
with
the
same
results
though
meaning
it
ends
up
another
summer
brew
i
wont
purchase
anytime
soon
doesnt
sniff
any
of
the
better
pales
on
the
market
today
and
we
all
know
there
are
a
ton
pass
shipyard
summer
ale
pours
a
light
orange
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
smell
is
diacetyl
butterscotch
taste
is
pure
butterscotch
maybe
a
little
citrus
torward
the
finish
not
my
thing
i
really
just
dont
dig
their
yeast
which
is
where
this
butterscotch
taste
is
coming
from
if
you
dig
ringwood
yeast
flavors
this
is
your
brew
otherwise
avoid
i
guess
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
clean
refreshing
summer
beer
but
there
was
nothing
to
it
nothing
that
makes
it
any
better
than
any
typical
light
macro
quite
disappointing
pours
a
yellow
straw
with
a
large
white
head
the
smell
is
very
light
with
only
a
hint
of
lemon
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
maltfloral
and
lemon
flavors
that
make
this
very
drinkable
beer
the
mf
is
light
with
the
aftertaste
alittle
watery
a
nice
summer
beer
not
the
best
but
a
beer
that
goes
down
good
on
a
hot
day
nothing
special
not
even
on
a
scorcher
of
a
day
id
opt
for
a
more
focused
complex
or
balanced
wheat
beverage
for
summer
refreshment
just
in
this
week
at
the
local
pub
nothing
special
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
small
head
that
didnt
last
a
sweetfruity
gariny
odor
very
ordinary
taste
not
much
to
discern
could
detect
a
little
citrus
as
well
as
some
hops
it
did
feel
ok
in
the
mouth
and
was
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
it
would
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
day
not
impressed
with
the
summer
ale
from
shipyard
it
sounded
like
opening
a
pepsi
when
i
popped
the
top
poured
a
sickly
brown
color
with
a
smell
to
match
it
left
a
bittersour
taste
in
my
mouth
and
i
struggled
to
get
malt
down
wasnt
smooth
going
down
either
ill
stick
to
old
thumper
a
bit
more
backbone
than
other
weak
summer
offerings
but
it
still
lacks
and
comes
across
as
yet
another
lackluster
summer
seasonal
light
fruity
aroma
of
bananas
apricots
pineapples
all
kinds
of
summery
fruits
moderately
thick
foamy
bright
white
colored
head
completely
transparent
apricotcopper
colored
beer
with
dozens
of
stream
of
fine
bubbles
rising
briskly
to
the
surface
interesing
mix
of
butterscotch
and
apricot
in
the
flavor
the
finish
is
just
barely
bitter
and
alcoholic
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fairly
soft
this
beer
wasnt
that
cold
when
i
pulled
it
from
the
fridge
and
barely
cool
by
the
time
i
drank
i
think
the
temperature
brought
out
a
lot
of
flavor
and
aroma
that
i
hadnt
noticed
in
previous
colder
bottles
light
and
fruity
when
cold
but
becomes
more
interesting
as
it
warms
this
looked
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
nice
golden
hue
almost
an
orange
color
served
with
a
lemon
though
i
took
that
right
out
it
had
little
to
no
head
and
had
a
cloudy
presence
to
it
could
not
get
the
aroma
of
this
beer
although
i
had
the
carrabassett
pale
ale
before
it
but
the
only
thing
that
i
was
even
close
to
was
a
fruity
aroma
this
seems
to
be
a
wheat
based
ale
with
a
hint
of
citrus
maybe
lemon
or
grapefruit
kind
of
a
sour
feel
when
first
trying
it
smooth
and
easy
after
taste
i
have
always
liked
this
beer
during
the
summer
when
it
is
released
mildly
refreshing
light
in
body
crisp
start
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
this
brew
smells
and
feels
good
on
the
tongue
but
the
flavor
is
average
at
best
this
knocks
drinkability
down
a
notch
clear
light
copper
color
decent
size
white
foamy
head
light
bready
and
citrus
aromas
balanced
malt
and
hop
flavors
light
to
medium
body
with
a
watery
and
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
mild
honey
sweetness
very
average
and
middle
of
the
road
pale
ale
not
as
much
character
compared
to
previous
years
seems
weak
when
put
up
against
many
of
the
other
summer
seasonals
well
this
one
does
the
trick
it
is
indeed
a
nice
citrusy
summer
ale
as
summer
ales
go
this
one
has
a
nice
full
profile
with
the
aroma
of
lemony
hops
and
dry
wheat
along
with
a
similar
flavor
the
key
for
a
summer
ale
is
its
drinkability
and
i
find
this
one
certainly
is
gone
before
you
know
it
its
a
nice
reward
for
mowing
the
lawn
shipyard
summer
ale
is
simple
fare
and
would
be
a
good
accompaniment
to
a
warm
weather
picnic
for
my
bottom
line
see
the
first
sentence
of
the
previous
paragraph
summer
ale
will
undoubtedly
be
my
last
summer
beer
until
next
summer
rolls
around
drinkability
is
a
little
below
average
theres
just
something
a
little
off
about
this
beer
that
doesnt
seem
to
sit
well
drinkability
summer
ales
make
great
session
beers
this
one
doesnt
the
captains
collection
summer
brew
nice
to
be
had
it
poured
a
solid
pale
gold
with
a
fair
soft
white
wispy
head
that
laced
some
a
lemongrain
aroma
was
on
the
nose
the
taste
carried
a
citric
spicey
hop
to
crisp
things
up
while
balanced
softly
by
a
buttered
toast
grain
that
buttery
feel
lingers
on
the
mouth
abit
the
beer
is
drinkable
as
the
body
seems
lighter
not
chewy
a
good
one
cold
american
pale
ale
huhanyways
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
thin
wispy
head
but
with
good
carbonationaroams
a
really
muted
some
light
citrius
but
not
much
there
taste
is
buttery
from
the
yeast
strain
with
a
light
hoppy
note
taking
over
as
i
drink
more
with
a
toasty
taste
lingering
in
the
finish
an
easy
drinker
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
out
again
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
poured
out
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
big
amount
of
carbonation
that
settled
down
somewhat
smell
consisted
of
spicy
hops
lemon
and
some
malts
in
there
as
well
taste
was
about
the
same
as
the
nose
spicy
hops
that
lasted
a
good
while
combined
with
some
malts
and
citrus
notes
but
with
those
spicy
hops
in
the
aftertaste
came
the
buttery
aftertaste
seemed
to
last
forever
in
this
brew
this
almost
crosses
the
lines
with
a
pils
somewhat
but
man
that
buttery
aftertaste
is
sometimes
too
much
can
we
say
ringwood
all
in
all
this
could
be
a
good
alternative
during
the
summer
months
but
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
for
it
a
decent
brew
nothing
special
from
the
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
liquid
with
a
white
fluffy
head
the
head
was
present
for
a
long
time
leaving
a
good
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
slightly
malty
with
perhaps
a
citrus
note
or
two
not
much
else
jumping
out
taste
was
a
nice
light
malt
slight
tartness
with
some
modest
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
not
too
much
overall
a
refreshing
summer
beer
pretty
light
but
with
a
nice
hint
of
hops
in
it
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
yet
malty
scent
with
a
fruity
yeast
finish
very
nice
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
light
yet
slightly
malty
flavor
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
some
hops
it
seems
a
tad
grainy
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
summer
brew
but
nothing
more
it
has
a
good
aroma
but
the
taste
is
a
disappointment
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
thick
1
white
head
above
the
clear
strawwithatingeoforange
brew
laces
nicely
aroma
is
lightly
of
pale
malts
taste
is
if
pale
malts
with
a
slight
hops
bite
at
the
end
kind
of
nondescript
but
nothing
bad
going
on
mouthfeel
good
and
im
torn
on
drinkability
because
one
could
drink
it
all
day
but
not
sure
what
would
be
the
impetus
to
do
so
except
for
a
lawnmowing
type
application
an
acceptable
brew
as
summers
go
pours
a
nice
solid
golden
hue
with
a
very
light
stark
white
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
just
a
crisp
clean
scent
of
a
little
bit
of
malt
slightly
foamy
creamy
mouthfeel
yields
a
palate
of
light
hops
a
bit
of
malt
and
a
light
citrus
flavor
nothing
really
special
but
great
for
a
summer
night
drinking
session
very
nice
summer
beer
springy
and
light
with
out
tasting
like
cold
sparkiling
urine
maybe
my
sample
is
old
dated
oct
03
for
consumption
just
not
impressive
at
all
notes
a
bit
disconcerted
that
this
is
classified
as
a
pale
ale
at
the
very
least
its
closer
to
an
american
style
wheat
ale
this
is
a
really
great
summer
ale
probably
one
of
the
best
out
there
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
from
new
england
it
tasted
like
a
kolsch
to
me
easily
one
of
shipyards
best
brews
pours
a
medium
golden
small
white
head
no
lace
tons
of
tiny
bubbles
rushing
through
the
body
aroma
is
fairly
light
consisting
of
sourness
some
lemon
some
wheaty
aromas
flavor
is
also
fairly
light
the
same
sourness
lemon
some
ringwood
funkiness
is
present
fairly
thin
bodied
overal
entirely
average
i
would
say
thanks
to
pedrmrtnz45
for
this
nice
quaffable
beer
pale
light
amber
good
sized
off
white
head
retention
is
better
than
adequate
and
lacing
is
sufficient
this
beer
has
a
buttery
butterscotch
like
aroma
reminiscent
of
an
english
style
pub
ale
does
this
beer
use
a
ringwood
yeast
strain
hmmm
a
little
apple
skin
and
pale
malt
on
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
buttery
and
slightly
fruity
solid
enough
malt
backbone
with
caramel
qualities
coming
through
slightly
slight
bitterness
is
present
mouthfeel
is
slick
but
definitely
carbonated
body
is
better
than
medium
average
beer
little
better
than
average
i
guess
overall
i
like
the
beer
its
a
good
but
not
great
summer
ale
that
would
be
well
complemented
with
spicy
or
sweet
barbeque
or
a
fresh
lobster
perhaps
the
taste
only
a
little
more
present
than
the
aroma
light
body
with
tastes
just
hints
of
malt
yeast
and
citrus
slightly
watery
and
not
really
much
of
anything
this
beer
was
neither
bad
nor
good
nor
was
it
really
there
6
99
6pack
pretty
standard
summer
ale
from
shipyard
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
was
retained
for
most
of
the
glass
smells
were
indistinct
and
almost
macro
like
taste
was
clean
and
crisp
without
much
in
the
way
of
hops
plenty
of
light
malts
witha
wheatyslightly
yeasty
finish
decent
carbonation
as
well
i
could
slug
back
a
bunch
of
these
after
working
in
the
fields
and
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
doing
a
light
golden
summer
ale
that
has
a
little
more
malt
to
it
than
most
the
citrus
kind
of
kills
it
for
me
im
more
of
a
darker
ale
kind
of
guy
anyway
fwiw
not
bad
for
a
summer
beer
but
its
still
a
summer
ale
better
than
some
other
local
summer
ales
but
nothing
to
run
out
and
get
this
beer
nearly
sucks
in
fact
im
not
even
going
to
finish
it
clear
light
gold
with
thin
creamy
white
head
almost
no
retention
at
all
sour
wheat
aroma
with
little
hop
presence
slightly
sweet
and
sourwith
dry
bitter
flavors
big
dissapointment
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
great
ale
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
the
color
is
a
light
orangish
yellow
and
quite
clear
the
head
consists
of
large
white
bubbles
which
rapidly
dissipate
into
nothing
more
than
a
thin
ring
of
lace
smell
is
minimal
with
barely
noticable
hints
of
hops
and
malt
drinken
cold
this
beer
has
a
very
good
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
pleasant
amount
of
carbonation
gracing
the
tongue
taste
was
nothing
special
just
mild
malt
flavor
with
subtle
undertones
of
hops
which
stick
around
for
a
mild
aftertaste
all
in
all
a
very
nice
light
ale
for
a
warm
night
orange
and
straw
mix
in
the
color
with
a
longlasting
pillowy
white
head
there
are
clean
judicious
citrus
flavors
balanced
with
a
belt
of
hops
i
rarely
find
in
a
summer
style
the
finish
is
appealingly
dry
maybe
ill
have
to
order
this
under
the
sun
more
often
i
was
very
impressed
with
shipyards
winter
ale
this
year
and
with
most
of
their
other
products
but
this
one
disappointed
me
in
comparison
with
the
summer
ales
from
geary
and
casco
bay
it
doesnt
begin
to
compete
in
taste
or
overall
appeal
hard
to
say
what
its
flavor
profile
may
be
other
than
its
relatively
bland
with
no
special
malt
or
hop
overtones
maybe
a
light
fruity
taste
would
be
my
best
description
its
not
a
bad
product
and
certainly
quite
drinkable
its
just
not
a
product
im
willing
to
pay
a
premium
micro
price
to
obtain
maybe
theyre
hoping
to
appeal
to
a
broader
market
than
micro
fans
clearly
transparent
gold
color
with
a
decent
14
inch
spritzy
head
tight
and
thin
laces
aroma
is
light
lemon
with
some
sense
of
peach
and
a
lack
of
obvious
banana
esters
initial
flavor
follows
aroma
closely
lightbodied
from
the
outstart
hops
are
masked
at
best
and
the
finish
is
a
little
watery
but
relatively
crisp
and
citrusy
drinkable
enough
no
off
notes
i
still
prefer
a
little
more
taste
in
the
warm
weather
the
beer
pours
a
liquid
gold
color
the
head
modest
in
size
frothy
in
texture
and
the
resultant
lace
a
fine
covering
sheet
nose
is
malt
sweet
crisp
and
fresh
with
a
sweet
malt
start
the
top
is
moderate
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
persistent
acidity
the
hop
purposeful
in
their
spicy
bite
dry
long
lasting
aftertaste
and
a
fine
quaffing
beer
at
any
rate
theres
absolutely
nothing
to
be
enjoyed
here
was
not
impressed
with
this
offering
tasted
like
an
ale
someone
had
roped
some
nutmeg
in
nice
scolor
and
head
but
couldnt
hide
the
taste
the
shipyard
should
stick
with
prelude
this
is
just
average
this
beer
has
a
light
gold
color
and
an
almost
estery
fruity
aroma
that
also
comes
through
nicely
in
the
flavor
of
the
brew
cold
and
light
bodied
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
and
richly
flavored
libation
this
is
one
tasty
summer
brew
shipyard
bills
it
as
a
wheat
beer
but
its
not
tart
citrusy
and
bland
like
most
others
it
has
more
of
a
sweet
fruity
start
and
drying
butterscothy
finish
overall
a
delicately
balanced
lighter
beer
not
bad
alittle
to
much
lemon
nice
buttery
after
taste
if
you
want
a
summer
beer
try
a
good
wheat
this
was
very
disappointing
nothing
special
one

smuttys

refresher

nice
and
enjoyable
summer
beer
overall
among
my
favorite
summer
beers
ive
tried
this
year
its
relatively
simple
but
its
really
tasty
and
refreshing
and
reasonably
complex
for
a
picnicworthy
beer
smuttynose
is
really
good
at
what
they
do

this
is
more
proof
o
effortless
yet
interesting
and
complex
a
rare
gem
must
try
my
favorite
summer
ale
pours
a
light
copper
with
less
than
a
finger
of
head
that
dissipated
down
to
a
thin
film
on
top
of
the
liquid
the
nose
was
very
mild
the
flavor
has
wheat
and
something
sweet
that
was
hard
to
place
but
moderately
pleasant
there
is
also
a
mild
essence
of
funk
to
this
beer
definitely
nothing
too
disturbing

a
murky
light
orange

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
an
average
smell
and
very
grain
forward
flavors
overall
its
ok
perhaps
the
brewer
was
just
going
for
something
a
little
different
that
doesnt
super
appeal
to
me
o
not
an
impressive
wheat
beer
sure
you
can
probably
knock
back
multiple
on
a
hot
day
which
is
what
its
intended
for
but
i
can
find
many
other
examples
of
the
style
for
the
same
price
that
are
much
better
o
dare
i
say
smuttynoses
worst
beer
by
a
long
shot
o
it
is
just
very
plain
and
unimpressive
definitely
not
a
good
weizen
flavor
is
rich
with
a
good
amount
of
malty
subtlety
i
get
the
light
grains
again
and
the
chamomile
addition
adds
a
slightly
herbal
feel
again
this
is
a
light
and
subtle
wheat
ale
that
i
found
quite
enjoyable
and
perfect
for
a
simmering
summer
afternoon
in
indiana
this
is
a
nice
light
refreshing
wheat
beer
this
isnt
big
on
flavor
but
it
is
big
on
drinkability
the
hop
bitterness
was
a
tad
intense
for
the
overall
flavor
but
it
doesnt
throw
the
beer
out
of
balance
overall
a
nice
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
and
refreshing
to
drink
during
these
hot
summer
days
pours
a
hazy
medium
straw
color
with
a
good
sized
bubbly
white
head
that
persists
for
a
while
smells
of
yeast
and
wheat
and
citrus
and
a
hint
of
bread
and
cereal
with
a
light
floral
scent
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
up
front
with
some
bready
malts
followed
up
by
some
lemony
citrus
and
light
yeasty
phenols
a
hint
of
earthy
hop
or
maybe
it
chamomile
to
finish
this
off
light
to
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
ok
to
drink
on
this
90
degree
and
humid
day
but
not
something
i
think
i
would
ever
want
again
the
flavors
dont
work
for
my
palette
this
brewery
took
a
chance
with
a
very
unusual
brew
and
usually
when
breweries
do
that
they
either
hit
or
miss
however
this
one
is
just
average
and
with
so
many
summer
beers
available
next
time
ill
pass
pours
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
a
fingers
worth
of
foam
that
fell
fast
but
left
good
lace
nose
is
belgian
sweet
bread
lemon
with
a
hint
of
sour
spice
and
wheat
its
a
calm
nose
with
good
yeast
taste
is
very
complex
bread
cracker
and
full
but
smooth
and
mild
ample
carbonation
but
thin
body
drinks
a
little
heavy
but
clean
and
crisp
the
chamomile
is
just
lightly
on
top
combining
with
the
faintly
floral
hops
and
meets
the
malt
right
where
it
would
get
sweet
but
doesnt
the
lemon
and
the
wheat
come
together
so
closely
that
you
are
tempted
to
think
that
you
cant
taste
the
lemon
but
your
mouth
does
water
finishes
dry
with
a
touch
of
bitter
and
the
malt
lingers
too
in
the
finish
i
liked
it
delightful
all
the
way
around
the
summer
weizen
is
an
easy
throw
back
type
of
beer
because
of
its
refreshing
taste
clean
texture
and
effortless
drinkability
o
underwelming
expected
a
little
more
from
smuttynose
this
beer
is
light
orange
in
color
with
a
hazy
nontransparent
complexion
a
finger
thick
head
quickly
accumulates
and
recedes
slowly
leaving
behind
a
thin
lacing
around
the
sides
of
my
glass
this
thing
looks
the
way
a
good
wheat
beer
should
look
the
smell
is
interesting
and
leads
with
spicy
cloves
mild
banana
and
husky
wheats
and
grains
the
beers
flavor
follows
suit
its
light
fruity
and
wellbalanced
all
the
while
with
a
solid
underlying
wheatiness
hints
of
banana
some
light
grassy
hops
and
yeasty
malts
throughout
its
lightbodied
and
refreshing
a
perfect
summer
consistency
overall
a
nice
wheat
beer
that
gives
a
nice
balance
between
an
american
wheat
ale
and
a
hefeweizen
huge
head
tons
of
lace
two
finger
cap
after
seven
minutes
hazy
golden
brew
with
gentle
microfine
carbonation
lemony
aroma
with
wheat
malt
and
light
sweet
breadiness
bright
citrusy
hops
taste
is
lemony
wheat
and
crystal
malt
with
a
dry
graininess
like
a
good
pilsner
very
clean
hops
give
a
zesty
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
pepper
and
hop
oil
lingering
faintly
feel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
crisp
carbonation
and
quenching
character
a
very
nice
summer
session
ale
and
a
good
alternative
to
a
well
done
pilsner
poured
this
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
while
till
calming
down
the
smell
is
wheat
and
a
hint
of
lemon
the
taste
is
of
wheat
and
some
lemon
but
not
much
else
going
on
there
the
mouth
feel
is
good
and
overall
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
good
for
a
couple
after
mowing
the
grass
or
yard
work
overall
definatly
not
my
first
choice
for
a
beer
its
really
not
anything
special
if
you
are
offered
try
it
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
buy
it
o
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
a
quite
enjoyable
beer
for
the
hot
summer
weather
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
would
seriously
consider
this
a
regular
summer
session
beer
o
i
dont
think
id
choose
it
again
but
not
bad
from
notes
9

12
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
pale
wheat
ale
the
chamomile
adds
another
dimension
to
the
beer
particularly
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
theres
nothing
overly
spectacular
here
but
it
is
just
a
solid
example
of
its
style
something
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
smuttynose
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
vibrant
bright
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
big
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
slight
coating
of
white
film
along
the
surface
aromas
of
lemon
green
herbs
and
roasted
wood
come
through
on
the
nose
flavors
are
a
bit
more
roasted
than
the
style
normally
produces
but
not
unwelcomed
lemon
zest
and
a
slight
peppery
hopping
bring
some
levity
to
the
backbone
with
a
grainy
main
character
powering
through
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
toasted
grains
with
only
a
slight
hint
of
hops
bitterness
tangy
somewhat
drying
finish
and
this
beer
quickly
leaves
the
palate
never
really
establishing
itself
prominently
while
you
drink
not
bad
but
smutty
has
much
better
offerings
12
ounce
bottle
the
stamp
has
been
smudged
a
bit
but
i
can
tell
it
says
best
before
sometime
in
september
2012
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
offwhite
head
that
stays
around
for
a
bit
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malt
wheat
and
some
light
honey
and
citrus
it
tastes
like
wheat
malt
light
citrus
chamomile
and
some
peppery
spice
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
seem
to
be
subtle
to
me
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
nothing
really
impressive
about
this
brew
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
better
ill
try
to
revisit
this
one
next
summer
and
see
if
i
like
it
more
then
1
79
for
a
single
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
wheat
and
biscuit
notes
with
some
lemon
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
some
bread
and
wheat
as
well
as
some
lemons
and
a
little
bit
of
white
pepper
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nothing
too
exciting
but
not
too
bad
overall
pretty
tasty
and
easy
drinking
could
use
some
more
wheat
flavor
pretty
decent
refreshing
wheat
ale
but
not
wheaty
enough
just
kind
of
average
nothing
to
complain
about
but
there
are
better
wheat
ales
leaves
a
dry
clean
taste
in
its
finish
it
is
highly
refreshing
in
its
finish
overall
i
give
this
one
a
4
00
one
of
the
most
refreshing
and
flavorful
summer
ales
i
have
ever
had
thanks
to
jason
at
epps
beverage
in
limerick
for
the
sample
i
may
just
have
to
get
a
case
of
this
i
find
smuttynose
beers
to
almost
always
be
an
excelent
quality
product
o
for
a
summer
beer
this
one
just
isnt
very
freshing
or
positive
tasting
smuttynose
makes
some
really
solid
beers
but
this
one
was
a
miss
to
me
its
tolerable
but
it
doesnt
really
work
for
me
just
way
too
metallic
tasting
on
the
pallet
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
summer
ale
with
some
nice
complexity
and
summery
flavors
the
body
makes
this
easy
to
quaff
o
out
of
all
of
smuttynoses
brews
i
was
the
least
impressed
by
their
summer
weizen
it
isnt
really
all
that
summery
and
the
flavor
doesnt
really
stand
out
appearance
is
great
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
but
the
taste
itself
isnt
too
spectacular
3
5
overall
going
into
this
beer
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
strongbitter
it
had
a
bitter
tasting
to
it
but
was
quickly
overrides
by
lemon
zest
not
too
thick
either
something
i
might
recommend
but
something
i
wouldnt
personally
try
again
othe
spiceherbs
do
not
balance
out
which
bring
down
the
brew
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
isnt
bad
not
the
best
smutty
but
i
always
end
up
with
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
the
summer
overall
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
it
just
seems
too
hoppy
and
unbalanced
overall
the
beer
is
mediocre
for
its
type
but
is
simply
meh
a
little
too
harsh
in
the
mouth
and
a
little
too
bland
in
flavor
overall
smuttynose
does
it
again
this
is
a
great
tasting
summer
beer
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
lawnmower
beer
wish
there
was
more
of
a
floral
or
tea
quality
but
then
again
it
might
lose
its
balance
it
works
as
an
american
pale
wheat
as
a
whole
tasty
little
lemon
quality
in
the
finish
is
a
plus
upfront
flavor
may
be
bland
its
still
just
fine
as
it
is
name
of
the
beer
threw
me
off
and
i
may
have
expected
more
but
in
its
style
id
take
it
over
many
others
3
5
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
its
a
good
beer
and
a
decently
represents
the
style
o
its
just
a
beer
folks
nothing
to
offend
yet
nothing
to
wow
you
either
if
you
like
the
style
i
assume
youll
be
checking
this
out
regardless
for
those
in
question
grab
a
single
i
heartily
do
not
recommend
this
beer
this
beer
looks
like
an
american
adjunct
lager
tastes
like
an
american
adjunct
lager
not
much
flavor
at
all
there
may
be
some
tartness
from
the
yeast
andor
the
chamomile
do
not
recommend
summer
weizen
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
half
inch
head
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
was
a
struggle
to
detect
anything
unique
in
the
aroma
aside
from
a
slightly
biscuity
scent
the
taste
was
a
watery
weizen
flavor
with
faint
hints
of
spice
it
was
a
very
mild
ale
that
did
not
leave
a
strong
impression
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
since
the
label
promises
the
ale
to
be
brewed
with
chamomile
flowers
there
was
nothing
that
stood
out
in
this
beer
i
generally
think
of
a
weizen
being
a
wheat
beer
with
a
sense
of
sweetness
any
flavor
here
was
very
mild
o
this
would
be
a
good
summer
thirst
quencher
the
sweet
and
bitter
and
nicely
balanced
and
the
flavor
is
pretty
damn
good
o
a
delightful
beer
to
enjoy
at
the
beach
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
nice
big
carbonation
really
makes
this
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
o
nice
easy
thirst
quenching
beer
poured
a
cloudy
lemon
yellow
with
nice
white
head
head
only
lasted
a
moment
no
lacing
to
speak
of
scent
is
warm
and
welcoming
taste
is
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
a
tangy
lemon
wedge
slight
aftertaste
a
bit
bity
the
citrus
becomes
more
pronounced
as
its
drunk
i
would
have
again
but
only
if
my
other
choices
were
very
limited
there
are
many
better
beers
out
there
o
not
quite
sure
about
this
beer
some
of
its
characteristics
are
not
very
particular
of
wheat
beers
which
is
strange
maybe
i
got
a
dud
who
knows
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
very
different
type
of
wheat
beer
thats
on
the
very
light
and
floral
side
go
for
this
one
d
okay
base
wheat
beer
what
makes
it
interesting
is
the
transition
from
sweet
floral
herbal
chamomile
open
to
the
bitter
herbal
earthy
close
really
a
pronounced
attractive
flavor
arch
besides
that
it
is
just
a
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
summer
beer
o
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
pretty
delicious
call
me
a
fan
it
was
ok
but
i
wasnt
sold
on
the
taste
and
did
not
find
this
as
refreshing
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
expected
a
light
summer
beer
but
this
just
had
too
much
of
a
grain
edge
to
suppress
the
wheatyeast
and
not
enough
fruit
to
meet
what
i
had
hoped
for
it
was
decent
yet
disappointing
to
me
o
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
so
light
and
refreshingly
delicious
simple
yet
effective
and
very
tasty
a
refreshing
beer
but
i
think
i
would
prefer
to
drink
a
hefe
or
one
of
the
hoppy
wheat
ales
that
are
becoming
increasingly
popular
moreys
bottom
line
something
i
could
drink
plenty
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
there
are
others
that
id
probably
reach
for
first
overall
good
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
good
qualities
the
thinness
of
the
texture
makes
it
a
good
summer
beer
but
the
flavor
is
lacking
somewhat
would
definitely
try
again
pours
a
nice
pale
yellow
golden
with
a
nice
whitehead
some
good
lacing
aroma
is
of
citrus
lemony
light
hops
with
somw
light
malt
and
fruity
esters
taste
has
some
good
citrusy
lemon
and
fruity
spices
some
light
grassy
notes
palate
is
nice
light
body
with
good
carbonation
nice
crisp
mouth
feel
finish
is
a
nice
citrusy
lemos
some
sweet
spices
and
grassy
notes
with
some
light
hops
has
slight
sweet
nutty
aftertaste
overall
a
very
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
summer
ale
o
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
smuttynose
but
a
nice
offering
the
chamomile
provides
some
nice
floral
notes
and
is
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
finishes
dry
and
floral
notes
of
mellow
grainy
wheat
and
a
hint
of
hop
bitterness
comprise
the
main
flavors
somewhat
thin
but
well
attenuated
and
dry
like
a
belgian
pale
clean
and
easy
drinking
just
not
all
that
interesting
minimal
and
crisp
easy
to
pair
with
food
probably
a
touch
too
bitter
and
dry
to
use
as
a
conversion
beer
for
macrodrinking
friends
poured
from
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
is
nice
wonderful
fluffy
head
with
cool
golden
feel
s
is
kind
of
harsh
with
a
pilsner
feel
cereal
is
prominent
t
is
just
ok
good
shallow
beer
for
summer
with
a
real
hint
of
bitterness
its
uncommonly
harsh
in
the
aftertaste
m
is
decent
maybe
a
bit
overcarbonated
o
its
just
kinda
okay
i
wouldnt
pick
it
off
a
shelf
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
a
nice
light
summer
drinker
the
body
is
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
it
is
manageable
and
goes
down
easy
just
when
you
want
a
beer
that
does
so
overall
an
ok
beer
my
wife
enjoys
drinking
it
a
lot
and
im
happy
to
buy
it
for
her
since
its
craft
and
well
she
likes
it
odthis
one
is
okay
10
six
pack
no
worth
a
try
yes
i
love
smuttynose
this
one
is
not
bad
finest
kind
is
such
a
fantastic
beer
that
my
expectations
are
very
high
for
the
company
still
pretty
decent
appearance
is
a
light
hazy
golden
color
with
a
pale
white
head
and
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
upon
opening
the
bottle
the
floral
scents
were
pleasant
but
as
i
drank
it
the
smell
seemed
to
become
more
medicinal
and
unpleasant
almost
vomitlike
the
taste
was
different
from
other
wheat
beers
a
vague
floralherbal
flavor
comes
through
maybe
a
slight
lemon
taste
with
some
piney
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
smell
became
so
offensive
that
i
couldnt
finish
it
this
one
ended
in
a
drain
pour
bells
oberon
ale
is
a
much
better
beer
of
this
style
had
on
tap
recently
with
my
wife
out
for
dinner
much
more
enjoyable
so
far
than
this
bottle
has
been
this
one
pours
a
clouded
bright
yellow
golden
hue
with
a
nice
thicket
of
bright
white
head
lacing
forms
bands
of
uneven
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
a
touch
of
honey
biscuit
malt
character
to
it
with
very
nice
floralherbal
notes
minimal
banana
or
clove
and
somewhat
of
a
graininess
the
label
says
its
brewed
with
chamommile
flowers
which
would
make
sense
for
what
im
getting
flavors
provide
some
balanced
breadygrain
husk
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
honey
harsh
bitterness
from
herbalfloral
notes
almost
something
perfume
like
in
nature
probably
the
chamommile
flower
additions
i
like
my
summer
weizens
to
have
a
bit
more
banana
and
clove
from
the
german
yeast
additions
this
seems
to
be
running
on
house
smuttynose
yeast
or
at
least
an
american
pale
wheat
yeast
addition
mouthfeel
is
actually
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
oily
textures
going
across
my
palate
finishes
rather
dry
not
sure
of
the
hopping
rate
or
ibus
on
this
but
id
venture
to
say
higher
than
your
average
hefeweizen
carbonation
isnt
an
issue
but
overall
enjoyment
level
was
lacking
a
bit
first
off
better
on
draft
and
flavor
wise
the
herbalgraininess
was
a
bit
off
putting
for
me
still
an
enjoyable
summer
sipper
just
not
what
i
was
looking
for
in
a
weizen
o
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
without
an
overpowering
flavor
profile
this
is
one
that
you
can
easily
drink
without
focusing
too
much
on
perhaps
at
a
cookout
or
over
a
game
of
horseshoes
i
filled
my
growler
with
this
summer
brew
within
an
hour
of
it
being
tapped
sudsy
pour
the
wheat
gives
the
ale
a
really
nice
flavor
with
yeast
in
the
aftertaste
clear
and
light
yellow
in
color
nothing
great
fun
to
share
with
friends
on
the
back
porch
sitting
in
the
cooler
on
ice
o
not
my
favorite
beer
genre
though
i
did
purchase
6
different
breweries
versions
to
try
and
compare
this
one
isnt
too
bad
i
feel
some
of
these
are
brewed
to
suit
the
more
causal
beer
drinker
but
also
to
go
well
with
summer
foods
and
the
heat
which
this
one
would
accomplish
those
objectives
standard
looking
american
wheat
pretty
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
smells
a
little
musty
and
a
bit
grainy
palate
is
refreshing
and
pleasant
the
floral
notes
from
the
camomile
are
mild
and
suprisingly
work
well
mouthfeel
is
pretty
lively
and
light
overall
this
is
a
nice
summer
wheat
but
not
one
to
seek
out
full
bodied
with
lots
of
bready
yeast
and
banana
again
this
is
surprisinlgy
hoppy
with
an
earthy
grassy
presence
that
adds
faint
dry
bitterness
the
hops
arent
overwhelming
however
and
the
wheat
beer
characteristics
are
still
prominent
zesty
spice
with
hints
of
clove
and
pepper
countered
by
the
yeast
and
sweet
citrus
notes
lots
of
lemon
flavor
toward
the
end
of
the
palate
with
a
dry
finish
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
especially
in
this
hot
humid
weather
expiration
date
of
sep
2011
sampled
on
june

2011
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
to
orange
and
slightly
cloudy
with
a
shortlived
head
there
is
slowmoving
but
regular
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
some
yeast
and
chamomile
spices
interesting
but
not
jawdropping
the
body
is
around
medium
and
quite
easy
on
the
palate
the
taste
boasts
a
kind
of
grainy
character
and
a
vague
fruitiness
of
the
meaty
variety
like
banana
it
ends
moderately
bitter
my
opinion
of
this
better
is
that
its
really
not
a
bad
beer
and
would
drink
several
if
presented
to
me
but
i
would
not
actively
try
and
seek
it
out
either
o
not
a
bad
beer
was
expecting
more
of
a
hefe
there
is
a
sweetness
that
comes
and
goes
throughout
the
drink
that
is
interesting
overall
one
and
done
on
this
one
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
per
say
perhaps
overly
simple
and
this
is
a
style
i
actually
generally
enjoy
overall
nice
tasting
beer
nothing
that
will
blow
your
mind
or
something
id
seek
out
again
o
consumable
still
better
than
a
us
macro
if
that
were
your
only
choice
but
a
huge
disappointment
for
any
wheatbeer
fans
my
wife
said
her
favorite
blue
moon
was
much
better
and
id
have
to
agree
omeh
based
on
the
description
and
other
reviews
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
subtle
but
complex
its
boringly
simple
and
i
could
find
other
beers
at
a
lower
price
point
with
a
similar
taste
profile
a
decently
refreshing
beer
but
nothing
fantastic
there
must
be
better
summer
ales
out
there
im
sure
of
it
if
youre
just
looking
for
a
good
thirst
quencher
youre
better
off
seeking
out
a
hefeweizen
or
a
more
mature
refined
summer
ale
overall
i
wasnt
real
impressed
im
not
saying
that
its
bad
by
any
means
but
maybe
just
a
bit
too
out
there
for
me
for
my
summer
drinking
ill
be
going
for
either
a
wit
or
a
hefe
not
a
semi
pale
concoction
of
the
two
very
nice
summer
offering
from
smuttynose
uncomplicated
and
easy
drinking
not
a
bad
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
summertime
drinker
overall
at
first
i
wasnt
crazy
about
the
floral
taste
that
the
beer
had
but
it
grew
on
me
as
i
progressed
through
my
glass
it
a
decent
summer
refresher
but
theres
lots
of
other
beers
in
this
category
that
id
rather
be
drinking
overall
a
solide
beer
that
i
enjoyed
633
d
very
drinkable
feels
just
slightly
light
in
both
body
and
flavor
but
otherwise
there
are
some
nice
flavors
that
are
really
nicely
balanced
and
are
really
refreshing
o
a
decent
summer
beer
but
many
others
are
just
as
good
if
not
better
i
really
really
enjoyed
this
beer
great
summer
refresher
here
the
lemon
and
the
wheatgrain
work
so
well
together
o
first
smuttynose
beer
and
a
very
disappointing
one
very
watery
and
not
a
fan
of
the
chamomile
overload
and
skunky
aftertaste
not
a
must
try
but
still
solid
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
somewhat
floral
some
notes
of
citrus
taste
is
good
a
bit
mild
some
citrus
and
spice
are
present
a
touch
of
wheat
and
hops
feel
smedium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
cheers
overall
i
was
disappointed
since
smuttynose
has
never
let
me
down
this
much
but
then
every
brewery
has
at
least
1
dud
if
not
more
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
one
is
well
executed
and
refreshing
the
chamomile
adds
an
appropriate
herbal
twist
that
elevates
this
one
above
most
of
its
blander
peers
drink
is
great
light
dry
and
crisp
light
herbal
hops
though
poured
a
medium
yellow
with
a
small
white
creamy
head
that
dissapated
rapidly
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
heavy
with
a
floral
hop
with
strong
notes
of
a
horseblanket
yeast
and
a
grain
malt
it
tasted
slightly
bitter
with
a
mild
citrus
flavor
at
first
and
ended
with
this
bitter
yeasty
flavor
with
a
nice
note
of
citrus
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
watery
in
texture
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
and
hoppy
wheat
ale
very
vibrant

feel
prickly

and
lowmedium

it
reminds
me
a
lot
like
sam
adams
wheat
beers
more
than
ive
ever
related
any
other
beer
before
pretty
good
summer
wheat
beer
however
a
little
harsh
around
the
edges
pours
with
a
pillowy
white
head
this
beer
is
rather
clear
for
a
wheat
beer
aroma
is
of
chamomile
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
chamomile
there
is
a
lack
of
balancing
wheat
and
yeast
flavors
in
this
beer
not
a
good
american
wheat
ale
i
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
drinkability
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
without
any
problem
good
show
of
the
style
definitely
worth
the
try
md
the
beer
left
light
as
expected
but
very
smooth
and
the
drinkability
may
have
been
the
best
quality
as
since
it
had
a
stronger
taste
than
most
beers
of
the
same
style
it
was
extremely
drinkable
overall
if
i
was
comparing
it
to
other
beers
of
the
same
style
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
for
the
style
but
when
comparing
to
the
other
beers
that
i
have
tried
this
one
is
better
than
average
certainly
not
one
of
the
best
but
one
that
i
will
defiantly
order
to
buy
again
i
liked
this
be
sure
to
give
it
a
try
a
good
change
of
pace
from
your
traditional
hef
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
some
light
cloudiness
a
bit
of
a
white
head
and
not
too
much
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
light
grain
as
well
as
some
light
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
hops
arent
nearly
as
prevalent
in
the
taste
although
some
flavor
is
there
a
few
grain
notes
as
well
feel
doesnt
provide
much
bitterness
and
is
quite
light
easy
to
drink
but
not

honestly
i

the
body
is
very
smooth
and
im
certainly
glad
i
tried
it
but
ultimately
i
just
dont
think
this
is
my
beer
one
of
the
most
complicated
yet
drinkable
summer
seasonals
there
are
so
many
flavors
to
deal
with
yet
none
come
at
the
taste
buds
in
an
aggressive
way
match
that
with
the
smoothness
and
you
have
a
winner
notes
it
is
definitely
a
light
summer
time
beer
and
a
good
one
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
ive
had
many
better
examples
and
as
such
dont
plan
on
buying
this
one
again
this
beer
put
up
a
great
head
it
took
two
pours
with
a
3
minute
intermission
to
get
the
whole
12oz
into
a
16oz
pint
glass
a
stable
foamy
offwhite

sweetness
to
even
it
out
taste
same
as
the
smell
finish
is
of
candied
lemon
rind
and
a
little
soap
pretty
good
american
wheat
ale
overall
supremely
refreshing
and
drinkable
just
enough
body
and
sweetness
to
give
this
one
some
depth
i
like
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
soapy
white
head
the
aroma
is
typical
of
weizens
clove
banana
and
some
odd
spicing
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
some
hop
aromas
in
the
finish
the
taste
is
not
impressive
in
the
slightest
taste
is
dominated
by
the
yeast
character
needs
more
malty
body
or

or
something
floralherbal
presence
is
unbalanced
and
offputting
for
my
liking
i
have
definitely

much
better
weizen
yeast
combinations
the
faint
malt
and
wheat
are
not
enough
to
overcome
the
other
numerous
misses
with
this
beer
no
thanks
in
the
future
for
me
overall
there
isnt
a
lot
to
this
beer
but
i
think
thats
just
fine
id
describe
this
as
a
lawnmower
beer
but
one
that
you
wouldnt
have
any
qualms
about
reaching
into
the
cooler
for
again
and
again
cheers
this
truthfully
wasnt
bad
until
it
warmed
up
hurry
and
drink
it
cold
and
youll
get
a
mediocre
wheat
ale
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
that
just
needs
a
bit
more
depth
and
strength
to
it
aromas
were
my
favorite
characteristic
of
this
one
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
more
i
have
the
more
i
think
that
i
can
have
another
as
i
said
earlier
i
havent
had
to
many
american
pale
wheat
ales
but
i
think
over
time
i
can
appreciate
this
one
more
so
id
say
pretty
drinkable
the
drinkability
is
good
its
quenching
and
unique
the
chamomile
is
something
that
while
pervasive
in
the
beer
works
well
and
is
not
your
typical
beer
additive
its
a
perfectly
drinkable
beer
but
also
one
that
doesnt
really
impress
its
by
no
means
bad
but
i
think
i
may
already
have
forgotten
it
d
drinkable
and
a
unique
take
on
a
summer
weizen
but
not
particularly
easy
or
refreshing
among
summer
brews
solid
beer
definitely
drinkable
good
for
a
deck
party
in
the
summer
ive
had
better
from
smuttynose
d
this
is
an
interesting
wheat
ale
ive
only
ever
seen
chamomile
in
shampoo
so
i
was
curious
to
see
it
used
in
a
beer
it
was
nice
a
simple
but
refreshing
summer
sipper
smuttynose
makes
good
beer
period
summer
weizzen
is
no
exception
though
you
wont
hear
many
raving
about
it
because
its
a
just
a
good
mild
ale
this
beer
is
good
and
refreshng
d
i
caould
see
this
as
a
summer
go
to
nice
to
have
a
change
of
paste
i
rated
drinkability
high
although
the
other
categories
were
a
bit
lower
mouthfeel
is
crisp
fairly
light
but
that
is
what
the
style
calls
for
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
nice
light
summer
beer
with
some
flavor
there
are
better
beers
out
there
for
this
role
but
this
one
is
not
bad
either
overall
a
lightbodied
tangy
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
american
wheat
would
pair
nicely
with
a
light
summer
salad
pours
light
golden
with
lots
of
effervescence
and
a
small
head
smells
grainy
and
slightly
sour
with
fresh
grain
aromas
on
the
end
as
well
as
slightly
lemony
the
taste
has
some
nice
bitterness
that
helps
rein
in
the
graininess
a
bit
the
finish
especially
has
a
nice
bitterness
but
there
is
also
a
tangy
lagerlike
yeast
that
asserts
itself
and
makes
things
a
bit
more
jumbled
and
less
crisp
refreshing
enough
but
a
little
unclear
in
focus
eh
though
i
did
grow
to
like
this
offering
after
3
separate
samplings
spread
over
2
weeks
ill
never
by
a
sixpack
of
it
and
never
order
it
at
a
bar
unless
its
the
best
choice
available
if
im
craving
a
wit
theres
many
better
ones
out
there
priced
similarly
and
id
pay
a
little
more
to
get
one
id
enjoy
more
id
highly
recommend
it
as
a
great
summer
beer
for
those
with
less
finicky
taste
poured
a
pale
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
little
aroma
bits
of
wheat
and
yeast
taste
is
refreshing
the
wheat
is
evident
as
well
as
grains
in
the
flavor
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
and
some
slight
sweetness
faint
taste
of
citrus
hops
on
the
aftertaste
high
carbonation
and
light
mouthfeel
this
one
could
be
pounded
all
night
and
day
assuming
youd
ever
want
to
for
me
id
take
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
on
my
own
quite
complex
compared
to
other
apwas
which
are
introduced
in
the
summer
months
which
tend
to
be
bland
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
well
nice
alternative
to
summer
pilsners
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
tangerine
with
an
initial
white
head
of
11
5
fingers
that
quickly
fades
but
holds
strong
at
roughly
half
a
finger
theres
not
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
to
speak
of
the
nose
is
a
blend
of
wheat
malt
sweetness
with
a
little
floral
note
in
the
background
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
though
the
addition
of
a
small
but
noticeable
hop
bite
is
welcome
the
beer
is
appropriately
light
in
body
but
the
carbonation
is
a
little
to
aggressively
high
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
night
but
overall
a
very
run
of
the
mill
and
forgettable
beer
overall
one
of
the
best
weizen
ales
ive
ever
had
and
is
great
for
hot
outdoor
parties
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
with
thin
fast
fading
white
head
smell
very
light
toasted
and
wheat
aromas
a
touch
of
orangey
citrus
flowery
maybe
the
chamomile
different
taste
powdery
crackery
wheat
that
coats
the
tongue
leafy
and
lemony
citrus
as
well
as
flavors
reminiscent
of
herbal
tea
mouthfeel
starts
light
but
creamy
but
a
somewhat
unpleasant
powdery
feel
takes
over
different
not
a
sessionable
summer
beer
imo
taste
is
very
pleasant
nice
mix
of
citrus
with
lemon
orange
and
a
good
deal
of
wheat
well
balanced
if
not
outstanding
good
bit
of
spiciness
and
surprisingly
medium
bodied
altogether
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
summer
drink
and
thats
what
pushes
it
forward
a
bit
for
me
good
session
beer
d
overall
smuttynose
summer
weizen
is
a
fine
summer
seasonal
beer
light
bodied
with
a
solid
amount
of
flavor
would
be
great
for
outdoor
tailgatesbarbecues
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
this
is
a
decent
summer
ale
but
nothing
really
outstanding
a
little
more
interesting
than
your
average
summer
wheat
but
not
up
to
par
with
other
smutty
offerings
drinkability
was
nice
but
i
like
some
other
apwas
more
i
mean
a
beer
like
gumballhead
is
the
exception
but
it
has
more
flavor
in
one
sip
that
this
entire
bottle
had
im
not
asking
for
extremity
for
the
sake
of
extremity
i
just
want
a
beer
with
a
touch
more
flavor
cheers
drinks
all
day
definitely
a
good
beer
for
the
warmer
time
of
year
d
a
full
flavored
and
refreshing
pale
wheat
treat
for
the
scorching
hot
days
of
summer
this
is
another
example
of
a
barely
average
american
wheat
beer
the
color
is
golden
and
there
is
a
light
haze
but
no
yeast
floating
around
at
all
the
smell
is
okay
but
nothing
special
a
little
clovey
the
taste
is
like
so
many
other
american
wheat
beers
there
is
a
small
banana
taste
but
also
a
little
salty
the
feel
and
drinkablitiy
are
also
just
average
i
wouldnt
look
for
this
beer
again
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
theres
nothing
that
really
stands
out
about
the
taste
although
its
probably
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
value
overall
pricey
for
what
it
is
i
cant
see
paying
more
than
eight
bucks
a
sixer
and
at
my
place
its
10
99
for
that
price
id
have
to
say
pass
d
this
beer
is
a
nice
crisp
light
beer
with
a
good
depth
of
character
to
it
not
like
the
weizens
ive
had
in
germany
but
pretty
good
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
with
a
slight
head
aroma
of
citrus
and
flowers
taste
is
at
once
sweet
and
bitter
very
little
wheat
or
yeast
in
the
nose
or
flavor
smooth
aftertaste
worth
a
try
smell
is
deep
flowery
malty
inviting
taste
follows
the
nose
sweet
malty
flowery
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
and
smooth
almost
syrupy
but
nice
drinkability
follows
suit
craemy
rich
very
nice
on
the
palate
poured
a
golden
yellow
srm4
slightly
cloudy
with
a
small
white
head
and
moderate
carbonation
citrusybanana
nose
with
some
spiciness
not
sure
if
peppery
of
coriander
dominated
sweet
softer
malt
flavor
with
low
hop
bitterness
and
a
orangespiciness
in
the
flavor
clean
finish
this
would
make
a
good
radler
beer
with
lemonade
smutty
summer
weizen
is
a
weird
beer
sure
but
its
good
and
unusual
and
quite
refreshing
on
this
humid
august
night
ill
buy
more
smells
like
grain
lemon
and
chamomille
tastes
that
way
too
crips
and
refreshing
this
was
perfect
after
a
summer
trail
ride
one
of
those
beers
i
like
better
than
my
rating
d
goes
down
easy
very
refreshing
could
easily
drink
this
all
daynight
camping
at
a
barbecue
or
any
summer
event
interesting
take
on
a
summer
brew
reviews
here
have
me
scratching
my
head
when
people
think
a
particular
beer
needs
to
conform
to
a
style
this
beer
creates
its
own
one
of
a
kind
style
and
i
really
dig
it
bone
white
head
of
about
a
finger
plus
mixture
of
bubble
sizes
lacing
slides
off
the
glass
swiftly
some
dimpled
texture
fully
transparent
yellow
to
light
orange
color
allows
the
light
in
enough
to
take
on
nice
brightness
bready
nose
of
sourdough
rye
and
wheat
notes
noticeable
lemon
to
grapefruit
accents
more
sweet
than
sour
as
theres
traces
of
honey
there
too
moderate
peach
to
apricot
fruit
at
best
very
clean
and
direct
which
helps
it
lift
and
blossom
some
lightbodied
the
carbonation
comes
at
you
steadily
with
a
fair
degree
of
churn
more
orange
and
lemon
citrus
than
grapefruit
again
more
sweet
than
sour
slightly
less
honey
but
more
floral
the
rye
wheat
breadiness
comes
close
to
pumpernickel
dry
enough
to
create
some
light
tacky
residue
on
the
tongue
after
a
few
sips
the
grassiness
is
more
like
a
tall
field
grasses
than
green
grass
blends
in
some
cooking
herbs
but
nothing
hot
or
spicy
steadily
grows
on
you
and
by
the
time
the
first
bottle
is
gone
you
just
might
want
another
i
feel
like
the
choice
of
chamomile
as
a
brewing
adjunct
is
weak
and
inconsequential
any
other
flavor
in
even
the
lightest
of
beers
will
overpower
the
subtleties
of
this
sleepy
herb
alas
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
cant
hit
a
home
run
with
each
and
every
offering
carbonation
is
pleasant
overall
its
an
ok
beer
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
drinkability
a
light
refreshing
wheaty
brew
for
summertime
fun
and
floating
around
the
pool
with
blonde
chickypies
d
this
is
a
drinkable
american
take
on
the
hefeweizen
a
good
summer
beer
that
is
quenching
and
would
be
a
popular
choice
for
summer
gatherings
i
didnt
expect
a
bad
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
so
this
was
a
big
let
down
i
cant
find
any
thoughtful
purpose
behind
this
beer
if
you
are
considering
buying
this
as
a
summer
refresher
get
something
else
not
great
and
also
betraying
stylewise
to
be
fair
i
drank
this
after
having
a
weihenstephaner
hefe
so
the
variation
within
the
style
is
particularly
indicative
ideal
for
those
who
like
apas
in
the
summer
but
not
really
worth
it
otherwise
lemony
aroma
with
more
grapefuity
hoppiness
than
usual
for
a
wheat
the
flavo
brings
on
the
hoppy
bitterness
to
complement
a
lemony
wheaty
tartness
i
think
this
works
quite
well
unlike
any
european
style
wheat
befits
an
american
experiment
refreshing
and
summery
but
keeps
hop
lovers
happy
another
nice
offering
from
this
brewery
d
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
in
the
sense
that
its
seemingly
part
wheat
and
part
adjunct
making
it
easy
on
the
palate
and
definitely
drinkable
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
certainly
above
average
to
my
taste
and
is
appropriate
to
the
style
except
for
the
floral
addition
which
keeps
it
interesting
but
doesnt
really
add
to
it
overall
full
bodied
but
refreshing
leaves
behind
a
bit
of
a
film
overall
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
going
back
to
again
really
very
nicely
done
and
i
was
happy
to
have
gotten
a
hold
of
it
usually
i
like
most
of
the
smuttynose
offerings
time
to
try
their
summer
seasonal
pours
the
typical
cloudy
orange
color
that
is
seen
across
most
wheat
beers
sort
of
a
sweet
smell
to
it
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
taste
is
very
smooth
and
somewhat
under
carbonated
nothing
too
different
about
the
taste
but
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
label
says
it
was
brewed
with
chamomile
flowers
could
be
that
or
could
be
my
mind
being
biased
after
reading
that
well
balanced
and
finishes
clean
nothing
harmful
going
on
here
and
nothing
spectacular
either
makes
for
a
nice
summer
drinker
but
if
you
want
uniqueness
look
elswhere
solid
beer
definitely
drinkable
good
for
a
deck
party
in
the
summer
d
very
drinkable
yet
satisfying
d
a
decently
drinkable
beer
though
not
smuttynoses
best
effort
still
easy
to
drink
d
good
for
a
go
but
there
are
better
weizens
out
there
smuttys
version
has
the
chops
to
hold
up
to
its
intended
style
but
the
recipe
could
use
some
tweaking
the
smell
really
throws
me
off
of
this
one
though
overall
a
tasty
and
basic
wheat
ale
dry
on
the
finish
really
dry
nice
carbonation
slightly
sweet
but
the
graininess
and
the
touch
of
hop
bitterness
make
this
one
complex
and
quite
tasty
great
summer
beer
for
sure

as
lemon

spied
this
on
draught
which
was
exciting
after
having
a
blah
abita
served
up
with
a
nice
hazycloud
of
yellowgold
it
soon
settled
to
pale
as
its
2
finger
foamy
head
crept
down
to
12
the
aroma
was
definitely
less
than
expected
very
mild
wheat
and
lemon
the
flavor
was
a
bitter
lemon
earthy
yeast
but
on
a
minor
scale
which
again
was
unexpected
i
would
have
thought
the
draught
would
have
made
this
more
full
and
pronounced
on
its
plus
side
it
was
an
easytodrink
mediumbodied
mild
wheat
that
would
be
perfect
on
a
warm
day
or
barbecue
d
im
having
a
hard
time
finishing
this
one
this
just
seems
way
over

a

down

slamdunk

for
the

down

i
can
see
myself
drinking
an
awful

of
this
beer
this
summer
overall
bland
a
real
disappointment
from
an
otherwise
good
brewery

in

category
it

revisiting
not
a
bad

by
any

ill
probably
drink
it
again
in
about
4
months
when
the

overall
drinkability
i
really
havent
had
a
beer
from
this
style
that
has
been
outstanding
except
for
gumballhead
this
just
falls
into
the
just
like
the
rest
category
the
controlling
taste
is
lemony
with
a
bready
aftertaste
slight
yeast
presence
assertive
carbonation
maybe
a
bit
too
much
finishes
up
with
some

d
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
but
also
not
much
to
really
recommend
it
against
most
of
its
better
peers
certainly
drinkable
fair
fizz
and
some
alcohol
here
good
hot
weather
beer
compared
to
some
of
thee
summer
beers
i
had
early
in
the
season
this
is
a
distant
finisher
ok
but
not
great
very
light
aroma
semicloudy
but
not
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
weizen
more
golden
like
a
pilsner
but
it
drinks
like
a
pale
ale
eggshell
white

that
does
not
last
long
and
very
little
lacing
has
a
very
fresh
character
almost
too
much
so
wet
hay
or
a
wet
barn
too
much
hops
and
not
enough
malt
to
balance
it
odd
and
indecisive
are
you
a
hefeweizen
or
a
pale
ale
commit
the
feel
is
fizzy
like
champagne
a
little
chewy
it
really
is
like
a
hefe
mixed
with
a
belgian
a
good
stronger
than
expected
drink
notes
i
thought
it
was
o
k
and
i
usually
say
this
when
a
beer
is
easy
to
drink
nothing
against
average
brew
as
it
serves
a
purpose
thanks
ohmesohoppy
for
the
opportunity
taste
is
not
as
smooth
as
i
would
like
for
a
wheat
almost
a
bit
harsh
i
would
almost
think
it
may
be
a
bit
skunked
but
i
have
had
it
before
pretty
crisp
for
a
wheat
but
i
dont
know
if
that
is
what
they
were
looking
for
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
decent
enough
to
drink
a
few
when
sessioning
but
only
if
i
did
not
have
anything
better
at
the
time
as
i
do
not
now
bummer
holy
zingy
tartness
this
has
a
unique
flavor
for
sure
kind
of
hazy
yellow
average
head
some
lacing
fruity
zesty
apple
like
tartness
i
love
the
apply
fruity
spiciness
vs
your
typical
wit
spices
little
earthy
but
this
thing
really
sets
itself
apart
i
like
it
will
be
picking
up
some
more
this
summer
for
sure
keep
on
keepin
on
smutty
you
guys
rock
i
personally
didnt
care
much
for
this
one
which
was
a
downer
because
i
picked
up
a
6
on
the
premise
of
just
wanting
a
different
summer
beer
i
cant
recommend
it
but
maybe
youll
find
it
more
palatable
than
i
did
pours
a
nice
hazed
golden
orange

small
white
head
rises
and
falls
not
what
i
am
used
to
with
wheat
ales
and
their
big
pillowy
bubbley
heads
smell
is
full
of
fresh
baked
bread
honey
and
a
slight
hint
of
earthy

follow

tropical
floral
notes

a
grassy
earthy
finish

mouthfeel
is
a
bit
overcarbonated
for
my
liking
but
for
what
this
beer
is
it
surely
helps
keep
me
yearning
for
another
sip
thanks
for
the
opportunity
john
this
is
quite
enjoyable
and
would
be
a
nice
summer
quencher
body
is
medium
and
rounded
one
of
the
better
american
style
wheat
ales
ive
had
much
more
enjoyable
than
pyramid
for
example
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
if
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
it
is
at
least
an
interesting
example
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
brew
based
on
the
name
summer
weizen
although
it
is
an
american
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
extremely
malty
this
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
and
if
i
had
an
opportunity
to
taste
this
previously
i
probably
wouldnt
have
purchased
an
entire
6
pack
the
appearance
is
very
inviting
the
subtle
hints
of
lemon
and
wheat
are
strongly
overshadowed
if
you
enjoy
a
strong
malt
taste
then
this
beer
is
for
you
i
cant
bash
it
because
its
not
my
style
its
well
put
together
just
not
what
my
taste
buds
enjoy
pours
a
slightly
hazed
yellow
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
and
seriously
sticky
lacing

a
wheat
beer

small
amount
lemon

nose
some
yeasty
smells
some
lemon
in
the
taste
buds
slight
tartness
some
hop
bitterness
but
mostly
the
wheatymalty
tastes
dominate
really
crisp
and
refreshing
for
me
spoton
for
a
summer
beer
and
the
low
abv
puts
this
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
great
summer
brew
its
a
good
thing
this
is
labeled
on
ba
as
a
american
pale
wheat
ale
because
this
was
nowhere
close
to
tasting
like
a
weizen
it
looked
similar
to
one
but
it
was
nowhere
close
to
tasting
or
smelling
like
one
the
2
good
things
about
the
beer
was
the
appearance
and
the
crispy
side
of
the
beer
everything
else
was
too
burnt
for
my
liking
pours
a
hazy
golden

d
ok
but
not
something
i
would
drink
the
day
away
with
that
refreshing
summertime
vibe
translates
into
the
taste
with
lemon
and
orange
along
with
a
breadlike
malt
making
for
a
refreshing
wheat
ale
mouthfeel
was
fizzy
and
light
drinkable
good
for
a
barbecue
go
for
it
this
was
a
nice
surprise
looks
good
in
a
glass
bright
yellow
and
orange
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drank
it
out
of
a
weizen
glass
and
enjoyed
the
constant
stream
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
the
head
stuck
around
for
a
long
time
and
had
a
light
aroma
of
yeast
and
a
bit
of
hay
good
taste
with
a
nice
bite
from
the
fizz
a
very
attractive
summer
beer
although
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
of
a
wheaty
taste
if
you
plug
your
nose
you
may
have
something
palatable
but
there
are
many
others
that
id
seek
out
before
this
one
apperance
is
a
light
golden
staw
color
slight
hazing
unlike
true
germanhefesno
yeasty
swirls
or
effervecent
head
to
speak
of
the
aromatic
profile
of
this
american
wheat
is
completly
unlike
a
german
hefe
instead
of
banana
and
clove
here
is
light
hops
slight
dry
nose
flavor
is
somewhat
bitter
light
dry
on
the
finish
this
beer
is
extremly
light
and
tart
so
light
yet
i
would
rather
have
a
delicatley
spicied
belgian
wit
anyday
i
wasnt
overly
impressedbut
drinkablity
is
where
the
beer
scores
its
highest
i
enjoyed
the
samplebut
wont
be
seeking
out
another
of
thesee
anytime
soon
d
its
a
summer
beer
for
a
summer
day
right
now
its
a
summer
day
after
a
day
of
yardwork
i
cant
imagine
anything
better
granted
i
drank
this
on
my
dock
after
getting
my
car
inspected
but
hey
six
of
one
hefe
dozen
of
the
other
this
was
definently
a
weird
one
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
it
poured
a
nice
light
amber
colour
with
a
bit
of
foam
at
the
top
nice
lacing
the
smell
was
strange
though
it
was
sweet
and
yet
it
had
a
bitter
scent
at
the
same
time
i
suppose
this
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
a
hybrid
brew
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
were
inoffensive
not
the
best
but
not
bad
at
all
it
wasnt
remarkable
i
do
love
a
nice
hefe
this
did
not
deliver
but
it
didnt
really
disappoint
its
drinkable
absolutely
100
i
cant
say
anything
bad
about
this
drink
but
i
cant
say
anything
amazing
about
it
either
my
boyfriend
who
likes
wine
over
beer
really
enjoyed
it
so
i
guess
you
can
say
its
a
crowd
pleasing
gentle
brew
ill
drink
it
again
if
it
is
offered
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
run
out
to
buy
it
again
this
is
a
quality
summer
brew
picked
up
a
six
pack
for
this
past
weekend
poured
into
hefe
glasses
a
decent
sized
hear
formed
and
lingered
for
a
while
the
color
was
yelloworange
and
clear
not
cloudy
like
a
normal
hefe
the
smell
and
taste
didnt
really
remind
me
of
a
hefe
very
much
at
all
the
weird
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
its
not
really
a
hefeweizen
and
not
a
summer
ale
either
its
a
hybrid
combo
of
both
the
color
and
body
looks
like
a
summer
but
the
head
formed
is
like
a
hefe
other
than
that
id
have
to
lean
towards
just
calling
this
one
a
summer
ale
its
smooth
and
easy
drinking
and
a
great
warm
warm
weather
beer
i
guess
it
is
what
it
is
a
pale
wheat
ale
so
in
that
respect
it
fits
the
bill
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
hefe
that
youll
be
let
down
a
bit
d
pretty
drinkable
probably
would
have
been
more
drinkable
if
it
wasnt
as
hoppy
but
still
enjoyable
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
some
lace
almost
clear
pale
amber
color
lightmedium
carbonation
and
light
bodied
slight
hoppy
nose
flavor
is
sweet
citrusy
but
finish
and
aftertaste
is
bitter
hops

67
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capitol
convenience
concord
nh
pours
an
almost
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
soapy
white
head
this
looks
more
like
a
pils
than
a
wheat
beer
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
lemony
detergent
like
smell
some
tart
apple
skins
not
very
good
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
kind
of
grainy
has
a
lemony
and
granny
smith
apple
tartness
and
a
noticable
grassy
hop
profile
in
the
end
the
feel
is
moderate
with
nice
carbonation
but
finishes
quite
astringent
and
tart
this
is
a
very
disappointing
wheat
brew
i
wont
get
into
the
fact
that
they
call
this
brew
a
weizen
its
very
grainy
for
a
wheat
brew
not
very
smooth
and
really
just
a
mess
i
dont
recommend
ok
mouthfeel
nothing
special
id
buy
this
again
pretty
drinkable
like
most
wheat
beers
has
a
brilliant
golden
body
with
a
slightly
hazy
appearance
topped
by
a
fingers
worth
of
white
bubbly
foam
smells
a
little
citrusy
and
and
a
little
wheaty
nothing
impressive
a
very
lemonlike
taste
that
finishes
a
little
bitter
and
a
little
like
cherries
this
beer
is
light
and
smooth
an
excellent
refreshing
beer
to
accompany
summer
and
this
humid
day
in
boston
mouthfeel
maybe
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
smooth
and
juicy
with
a
super
clean
finish
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
overall
a
nice
wheat
ale
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
on
the
east
coast
not
my
favorite
wheat
beer
but
worth
a
try
for
smuttynose
lovers
great
summer
beer
very
poundable
try
this
one
after
cutting
the
lawn
cheers
d
easy
drinking
average
summer
beer
somewhat
of
a
dissapointment
from
smutty
but
its
not
terrible
good
stuff
dprobably
not
a
bad
beer
if
it
was
fresher
but
ill
never
know
since
even
if
it
was
its
still
not
my
bag
the
balance
was
surprisingly
good
and
it
was
still
worthy
of
finishing
despite
its
handicap
drinkability
this
beer
is
alright
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
again
pours
hazed
straw
metallic
nose
slight
citric
edge
flavor
is
slight
citrus
with
strong
hefe
characteristics
nice
and
smooth
this
is
nothing
above
or
below
what
it
should
be
feel
is
typical
overall
fairly
good
for
a
person
looking
for
something
traditional
well
here
ya
go
looking
for
something
wild
the
next
one
over
might
be
a
better
bet
certainly
not
a
drain
pour
but
its
nothing
to
search
out
again
either
very
good
stuff
and
i
wish
id
been
able
to
procure
more
than
one
bottle
hope
to
find
some
next
summer
drinkability
a
decent
brew
a
few
of
these
would
be
most
pleasant
the
aroma
is
of
banana
and
other
fruits
maybe
peaches
and
apples
the
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
and
refreshingly
smooth
the
hops
actually
overpower
the
malts
in
this
weizen
the
mouthfeel
is
very
lite
bodied
and
pretty
dry
this
is
a
fairly
decent
example
of
the
style
slightly
hazed
light
golden
body
thin
off
white
head
leaves
moderate
amounts
of
lace
smells
like
a
cross
between
an
american
style
wheat
and
a
pale
ale
has
some
snappy
hoppiness
present
on
the
nose
along
with
some
very
light
wheat
properties
inviting
aroma
the
aroma
works
better
than
the
actual
falvor
which
is
very
average
some
west
coast
hoppiness
is
noted
cascade
like
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
a
lingering
bitterness
yeasty
character
is
pretty
subdued
unfortunately
otherwise
just
a
bit
of
wheat
tang
they
should
call
this
summer
wheat
ale
using
weizen
in
the
name
just
invokes
a
german
expectation
to
me
and
this
is
in
no
way
shape
or
form
any
type
of
a
german
weizen
this
is
my
third
from
this
brewer
and
i
have
yet
to
be
impressed
their
pumpkin
ale
tastes
like
turpentine
the
hanami
ale
tastes
like
battery
acid
and
this
tastes
like
a
musty
old
sock
im
willing
to
give
this
brewer
a
chance
if
someone
could
direct
me
to
something
decent
these
guys
make
not
very
enjoyable
weird
a
beer
perfectly
crafted
for
the
season
of
summer
the
write
up
is
quite
right
in
saying
this
beer
is
brewed
for
warm
weather
enjoyment
bring
some
to
your
next
picnic
barbecue
or
frisbee
game
i
know
i
plan
to
big
plenty
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
saw
this
on
the
shelf
frankly
i
was
hoping
for
a
tasty
hefe
weizen
but
this
was
not
to
be
the
case
if
american
pale
wheat
ales
are
your
thing
then
youll
probably
enjoy
this
pours
a
fairly
pale
straw
color
with
about
a
fingers
worth
of
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
lacing
smell
is
lemons
interspersed
with
wheat
and
a
faint
yeastiness
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
lemons
and
wheat
upfront
also
present
is
a
slight
spicynes
which
gives
way
to
a
bitterness
in
the
finish
throughout
there
is
are
slight
floral
and
fruity
notes
good
mouthfeel
moderate
body
with
nice
crisp
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
as
well
imo
this
is
slightly
muddled
and
not
quite
as
good
as
it
could
be
i
think
this
should
be
a
little
truer
to
its
style
which
i
had
assumed
was
a
weizenbier
from
the
name
or
they
should
throw
in
some
more
spices
regardless
this
is
a
solid
brew
smuttynose
summer
weizen
is
a
light
yellow
gold
with
a
tall
soapy
fluffy
head
a
medium
sour
aroma
of
lemon
with
a
yeasty
nuttiness
wheat
spiciness
rounds
out
the
aroma
these
are
also
the
flavors
and
lead
to
a
crisp
semidry
finish
this
is
a
basic
summer
refresher
good
flavors
and
meant
to
be
consumed
cold
and
preferably
outdoors
smuttynose
doesnt
make
a
bad
beer
this
is
just
on
the
bottom
of
their
list
there
are
a
few
more
complex
summer
refreshers
out
there
that
outshine
this
beer
leinenkugel
sunset
wheat
comes
to
mind
refreshing
with
an
average
mouthfeel
nice
on
a
hot
day
but
nothing
outstanding
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
filling
at
all
decent
representation
of
style
but
not
the
best
apwa
ive
liked
almost
everything
ive
had
from
smuttynose
thus
far
but
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beer
d
certainly
easy
ive
been
rolling
through
some
of
the
summer
beerspale
wheat
ales
and
this
is
the
richest
and
thickest
ive
come
across
it
reminds
me
a
bit
more
of
an
american
hefe
in
that
the
flavor
is
all
wheat
its
a
full
light
roasted
wheat
taste
with
some
pale
malt
in
the
background
while
its
rich
i
cant
say
its
terribly
deep
but
its
not
a
bad
wheat
beer
d
light
summer
taste
it
was
good
but
not
great
it
seemed
lacking
some
of
the
fruity
and
spicy
tones
i
was
expecting
for
the
style
d
ugh
i
tried
to
get
my
friends
to
drink
this
one
but
it
was
too
unpleasant
for
them
too
smuttynose
really
disappointed
with
this
one
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
too
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
against
my
better
judgement
just
to
make
sure
this
was
an
okay
keg
i
doubt
i
will
try
this
again
after
that
though
yuck
d
not
half
bad
i
personally
think
they
should
have
gone
all
the
way
and
spiced
it
with
orange
peel
and
coriander
or
used
a
cleaner
yeast
pours
a
light
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
smallish
head
on
top
that
dissolves
fairly
slowly
nose
is
mediocre
kind
of
spicy
some
citrus
mostly
mild
not
particularly
nice
taste
is
likewise
uninteresting
and
even
occasionally
biting
and
unwelcome
body
is
okay
i
cant
really
say
any
better
than
the
other
recent
reviews
have
stated
there
are
a
lot
of
other
american
pales
or
hefeweizens
out
there
so
get
one
of
them
instead
itll
be
better
the
down
side
to
this
beer
is
the
initial
smell
which
is
biting
and
not
enticing
at
all
as
the
beer
warms
the
spices
phenols
and
citrus
come
through
but
it
still
isnt
that
good
this
is
a
light
colored
light
bodied
fairly
well
carbonated
ale
with
not
much
head
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
not
all
that
balanced
but
i
do
like
the
bready
malts
the
citrus
lemon
the
spices
and
the
metalic
hoppy
bite
it
is
a
clean
beer
with
a
refreshing
mouthfell
this
is
a
very
drinkable
summer
ale
and
i
would
come
back
to
it
again
is
it
a
weizen
an
american
wheat
ale
a
wit
who
knows
who
cares
enjoy
the
beer
for
what
it
is
lchaim
d
ok
its
light
and
has
some
flavor
going
on
but
its
not
particularly
interesting
to
me
having
had
a
bunch
of
hefeweizens
american
pale
wheat
ales
and
summer
ales
recently
this
one
doesnt
stand
out
as
anything
other
than
mediocre
at
best
an
ok
seasonal
but
not
one
ill
buy
again
not
a
huge
summer
brew
fan
in
general
and
this
one
didnt
set
my
world
on
fire
certainly
not
worth
the
price
for
what
it
is
pours
a
opaque
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
holds
well
and
good
lacing
to
the
finish
aromas
of
wheat
malt
yeast
and
citrus
taste
wheat
malt
yeast
grapefruit
juice
finishing
with
a
tangy
slightly
bitter
after
taste
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
good
carbonation
much
rather
have
a
regular
hefeweizen
but
its
not
bad
for
an
american
style
wheat
ale
notes
not
a
style
im
a
fan
of
but
i
think
smutty
hit
it
on
the
head
a
good
summertime
beer
especially
for
fans
of
wheat
beers
picked
this
up
at
the
local
premier
gourmet
its
a
pretty
wild
beer
for
a
pale
wheat
doesnt
have
any
bitterness
to
it
it
has
a
good
mouth
feel
to
it
and
goes
down
really
easily
however
it
doesnt
really
have
an
over
the
top
taste
to
it
tasted
like
a
nice
summer
beer
dont
really
understand
the
weizen
title
but
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
out
if
ur
at
a
bar
and
want
to
try
a
nice
summer
brew
overall
a
very
good
summer
beer
just
got
back
from
the
driving
range
and
this
beer
hits
the
spot
high
carbonation
lemon
and
citrus
is
dominant
in
the
flavour
with
some
sligh
banana
notes
smooth
mouthfeel
starchy
aftertaste
little
bit
of
spicy
raw
wheat
and
pepper
in
there
slighly
grainy
and
watery
as
it
warms
up
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
very
nice
pretty
decent
head
down
to
a
thin
film
and
really
nice
stringy
lacing
aroma
is
actually
not
that
appealing
to
me
but
still
a
good
combination
of
nuttiness
and
grainy
wheat
malt
taste
following
in
same
fashion
crisp
wheat
with
nutty
hints
in
background
some
spiciness
in
there
and
a
dry
clean
finish
basically
what
i
expect
from
the
style
mouth
has
a
nice
bit
of
carbonation
good
body
just
right
got
much
better
as
it
warmed
which
would
do
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
good
beer
on
tap
4
5
years
later
on
a
hot
day
and
pretty
nice
drinkability
overall
fairly
drinkable
and
worth
a
try
12
oz
bottle
best
by
september
06
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
that
borders
on
yellow
and
it
has
medium
carbonation
that
goes
up
to
a
1
finger
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
it
smells
pleasantly
spicy
with
yeast
banana
a
wheat
tang
and
some
perfumycitric
hops
the
flavor
consists
of
this
and
a
nice
dose
of
medicinal
phenols
orange
peel
light
lemon
and
coriander
light
piney
hops
and
a
medium
bitterness
from
both
the
hops
and
the
phenols
the
body
is
medium
it
leaves
a
medium
finish
and
its
overall
a
tasty
summer
ale
that
is
packed
with
flavor
and
tastes
almost
belgian
would
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
pours
leaving
a
short
12
inch
head
that
tries
to
sustain
itself
leaving
a
crusty
ring
the
color
is
not
too
exciting
very
pale
yellow
with
light
haze
smell
is
not
bad
with
a
hint
of
citrus
spice
and
light
tang
more
like
a
witbier
really
taste
is
lemony
and
bready
a
bit
sour
which
lingers
on
in
the
finish
and
a
bit
yeasty
despite
its
thin
body
the
mouthfeel
has
reclaims
some
depth
with
help
from
a
nice
bubbly
zest
i
wasnt
too
impressed
overall
and
i
probably
wouldnt
have
two
unless
maybe
i
was
at
a
ballgame
in
the
hot
sun
for
awhile
brew

smuttynose
takes
on
the
classic
german
ale
with
an
american
sensibility
the
unfiltered
color
is
a
pale
staw
with
a
generous
head
the
scent
is
full
or
banana
clove
and
lots
of
wheat
malt
as
does
the
taste
it
has
a
nice
sweet
yeast
kick
that
pleasantly
rounds
the
taste
out
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
please
no
lemon
in
mine
light
brown
in
color
with
some
haze
opening
the
bottle
seemed
to
remind
me
of
the
smell
of
an
empty
keg
storage
area
not
terribly
pleasant
however
it
was
just
during
opening
and
improved
greatly
afterwards
to
where
it
smelt
decent
definately
could
tell
it
unfiltered
when
drinking
but
was
still
pleasant
enough
easy
to
drink
making
a
great
summer
beer
dnot
a
bad
summer
brew
but
the
lemon
flavor
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
a
bit
a
thirst
quenching
summer
offering
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
day
while
relaxing
with
friends
on
the
beach
enough
flavor
to
have
a
few
more
and
light
enough
not
to
knock
you
out
on
a
hot
and
humid
new
england
summers
day
i
was
excited
to
see
a
summer
beer
from
smuttynose
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
most
of
the
stuff
they
make
appearance
is
decent
with
a
yellowgold
hue
and
a
minimal
head
smell
is
a
but
sour
like
citrus
but
there
is
a
faint
hint
of
the
yeast
as
well
taste
is
great
just
a
classic
summer
weizen
which
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
ubiquitous
sam
summer
ale
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
terrific
the
drinkability
is
very
high
i
got
this
from
a
variety
12
pk
but
would
buy
it
out
right
prosit
mk
sharp
and
spicy
clean
and
refreshing
very
quaffable
on
a
warm
day
d
anything
from
smuttynose
is
drinkable
i
was
just
talking
about
that
tonight
good
one
to
grab
in
the
summer
if
you
can
recommended
the
taste
was
surprising
a
touch
harsh
a
touch
bitter
some
american
wheat
twang
some
bitterness
in
the
mid
to
finish
th
emouthfeel
was
surprisingly
full
perhaps
an
overcarbonation
burst
there
were
elements
of
perhaps
lagery
pilsnerish
type
stuff
anyhow
it
was
somewhat
refreshing
and
i
will
finish
the
six
pack
i
probably
wont
recommend
it
or
buy
it
again
though
poured
from
the
bottle
this
beer
came
out
nice
and
hazy
with
a
deep
tan
color
with
a
slight
orange
tint
the
beer
poured
out
a
nice
head
with
mild
retention
but
good
lacing
throughout
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
just
average
for
a
weizen
a
little
grain
a
little
fruit
the
same
can
be
said
for
the
taste
nothing
really
stuck
out
but
it
wasnt
bad
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
went
down
very
smooth
all
in
all
a
nice
drinkable
summer
weizen
this
light
bodied
strongly
carbonated
beer
is
a
refreshing
macrobrewery
alternative
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
day
md
a
little
light
and
thin
in
the
mouth
the
first
bottle
i
had
was
totally
hammered
by
a
spicy
thai
meal
so
i
had
to
try
another
a
few
days
later
the
lightness
does
make
it
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
poured
a
very
light
straw
with
quick
dissapating
white
headrelly
liked
the
aromas
really
clovey
i
even
picked
up
a
hint
of
nutmeg
in
there
as
well
a
lighter
lemon
pith
and
banana
aroma
sits
underneath
the
spice
not
a
real
complicated
or
complex
wheat
ale
but
that
makes
it
pretty
drinkableclovey
spice
with
a
hint
of
banana
and
toasted
wheat

real
summer
drinker

down

with
a
bit
of
wheaty
depth
and
some
dry
fruitiness
the
smell
proves
to
be
the
strong
point
here
taste
is
rather
lackluster
with
a
dry
burnt
somewhat
pithy
upfront
concealing
the
malt
body
very
slight
grainy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
but
overly
watery
in
general
on
a
hot
day
after
work
it
would
be
very
refreshing
but
otherwise
its
a
bit
lacking
in
general
i
have
definitely
had
better
summer
brews
a
suitable
substitute
for
german
hefes
of
questionable
vintage
while
maybe
not
a
beer
to
be
savored
certainly
one
to
enjoy
out
on
the
deck
more
of
a
one
night
stand
than
a
marriage
drinkability
the
drinkability
is
good
refreshing
and
tart
on
the
tongue
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
lemony
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
grainy
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
and
earthy
with
some
lemony
zest
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
brew
its
light
and
quite
flavorful
a
good
drinker
d
very
drinkable
this
one
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
i
could
imagine
a
better
ways
to
make
life
seem
a
little
bit
more
nice
rather
than
drinking
this
beer
for
an
american
wheat
fine
definately
standard
for
a
refreshing
summer
beer
with
taste
look
the
other
way
pours
an
uninspiring
clear
pale
golden
yellow
the
stuff
of
macros
only
saved
by
lively
streams
of
carbonation
that
feed
a
modest
snowwhite

that
lasts

the
end

taste
is
a

with
some
astringent
plasticky

mouthfeel
also
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
thin
and
flat
lacking
any
real
body
but
perhaps
thats
where
the
summer
comes
in
apparently
nobody
wants
any
body
in
the
heat
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
new
belgiums
sunshine
wheat
another
clear
thin
flat
middling
summer
apwa
i
suppose
its
refreshing
but
just
about
anything
wet
fits
that
bill
87
degree
humid
weather
yawn
drinkability
good
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
brwe
for
the
summer
its
one
of
the
better
seasonal
offerings
ill
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
in
the
future
ok
beer
for
the
style
even
if
it
is
a
rather
boring
style
this
one
could
be
a
bit
more
refreshing
if
the
graininess
was
toned
down
to
let
the
citrus
zing
come
out
a
bit
more
it
is
what
it
is
an
easy
drinking
summer
brew
tried
this
just
after
sampling
magic
hats
hocus
pocus
this
one
is
better
but
thats
damning
it
with
faint
praise
the
beer
was
a
golden
color
with
a
medium
head
it
had
an
average
aroma
for
the
style
citrus
and
grain
decent
taste
tart
citrus
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
slightly
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
department
ok
not
amazing
pours
a
hazy
yellow
not
much
headand
minium
lacing
not
much
there
for
the
smell
a
hint
of
spice
maybe
with
some
light
citrus
body
is
lightand
a
bit
fizzy
not
much
of
a
wheat
taste
some
spicewith
a
bit
of
a
bitter
edge
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
some
may
like
it
better
than
i
did
i
am
very
disappointed
in
smutty
for
this
subpar
brew
i
dont
even
know
how
they
can
call
this
a
wheat
beer
pours
like
any
standard
american
macro
lager
and
smells
like
one
too
taste
has
the
slightest
hint
of
wheat
and
a
good
amount
of
citrus
flavors
but
there
is
just
really
nothing
here
a
helluva
session
beer
as
it
is
far
tastier
than
the
masses
of
cheap
macro
lagers
but
nothing
that
makes
it
a
wheat
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
not
at
all
flattering
the
carbonation
is
rough
and
erratic
and
drinkability
suffers
as
a
result
this
beer
actually
was
more
enjoyable
right
out
of
the
bottle
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
but
thats
not
how
we
review
beers
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
a
summer
beer
good
summer
offering
from
smutty
these
guys
really
have
it
together
fairly
light
bodied
good
natured
evenly
carbonated
a
tasty
little
quaffer
definitely
just
a
usa
wheat
beer
and
not
any
kind
of
weizen
like
the
name
suggests
since
american
wheat
beers
are
very
average
generally
subpar
offerings
as
it
is
i
suppose
this
beer
lives
up
down
to
that
reputation
the
smell
is
off
kind
of
mildly
offensive
like
a
macro
lager
but
with
a
touch
of
citrus
on
top
the
taste
is
just
kind
of
disagreeable
and
not
very
smooth
nothing
shocking
or
horrible
just
not
really
good
the
budweiser
summerspicedheatwheatwhatever
i
had
recently
was
better
than
this
i
split
this
bottle
with
my
girlfriend
and
im
glad
i
only
had
6oz
of
it
drinkability
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
overall
with
the
yeast
dominating
rather
than
the
wheat
malt
not
my
favorite
version
of
the
style
but
this
is
nice
in
summer
for
sure
especially
for
this
insanely
hot
weather
and
junes
only
just
started
drinkabilty
i
found
this
to
be
an
easy
quaffing
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
refreshing
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
when
the
glass
is
empty
i
have
had
several
styles
from
this
brewery
i
have
always
been
pleased
this
one

looks

it

a
generic
blonde
that
tastes
pretty
good
on
the
whole
and
satisfies
just
fine
when
youve
already
been
drinking
all
day
but
probably
cant
hold
its
own
against
even
the
upper
middle
class
of
craft
brewed
blonde
ales
its
thicker
heavier
but
that
has
its
merit
too
i
like
its
uplifted
carbonation
and
its
thin
sweetness
medium
tinny
middle
though
and
an
old
semistale
hop
complexion
thats
underdone
and
missing
something
still
its
refreshing
in
the
right
context
not
as
good
as
others
from
these
guys
but
a
decent
brew
i
always
find
it
a
little
weird
when
a
brewery
can
rock
out
a
barrel
aged
imperial
brew
but
cant
dial
in
a
real
basic
thing
like
this
one
it
almost
seems
lazy
or
complacent
rather
than
incompetent
and
maybe
thats
a
greater
offense

overall

a

an

brew
overall
o
a
sold
beer
if
you
have
been
working
outside
all
day
and
need
a
refreshing
brew
of
you
looking
for
a
flavor
bomb
try
something
else
sorry
guys
it
just
wasnt
good
overal
a
pretty
unispiring
beer
refreshing
on
a
very
hot
day
perhaps
cant
think
of
any
other
positive
reason
for
buying
it
this
is
a
cloud
pale
gold
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
fades
to
film
the
aroma
is
unpleasant
very
vegetal
ugh
flavor
follows
the
smell
except
also
doughy
limpid
disgusting
glad
i
only
bought
one
of
these
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
at
least
a
couple
years
favoring
a
sweeter
finish
the
ale
appeals
to
fans
of
fruitier
and
sweeter
ale
but
its
reluctance
to
dry
in
finish
limits
its
drinkability
and
refreshment
its
fruity
center
does
however
make
this
dirty
blonde
an
irresistible
choice
more
fruitforward
than
i
expected
certainly
not
the
most
complex
profile
but
a
drinkable
beer
could
use
more
wheat
and
malt
character
along
with
some
hops
i
give
this
a
3
0
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
at
the
store
for
enjoyment
however
i
would
have
again
if
offered
at
a
gathering
where
it
was
accessable
vs
the
buds
and
the
millers
average
at
the
very
best
o
a
solid
beer
lacks
any
kind
of
a
kick
no
head
retention
if
you
dont
aggressively
pour
this
beer
it
has
no
head
to
start
with
if
you
pour
aggressively
the
weak
bubbly
head
wont
last
two
sips
seems
to
taste
better
while
cold
if
you
drink
it
slowly
itll
lack
any
flavor
at
the
end
nice
color
but
very
weak
carbonation
not
my
cup
of
tea
im
by
no
means
a
hop
head
as
summer
brews
helles
kolsch
and
belgian
saison
are
my
favs
i
thought
i
liked
pale
wheat
ales
but
this
one
is
telling
me
i
dont
slightly
hazed
body
eggshell
white
head
forms
a
cloudy
three
fingers
worth
with
fine
even
lacing
aroma
has
a
nice
sharp
wheat
and
citrus
combo
with
very
mild
spice
additions
limited
coriander
which
is
usually
a
good
thing
for
my
palate
flavor
wise
theres
some
biscuit
bread
dough
layers
with
a
very
chalky
yeast
in
the
finish
slight
hint
of
citrus
peel
and
coriander
with
a
relatively
lackluster
overall
flavor
carbonation
is
light
not
much
on
the
palate
as
far
as
textures
go
but
still
not
a
horrible
beer
under
4
5
its
light
and
refreshing
and
keeps
you
wanting
to
experience
the
next
sip
it
has
a
trademark
atwater
characteristic
it
misses
the
mark
on
the
style
and
ends
in
a
generic
watered
down
version
of
a
witbier
i
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
but
cant
really
look
at
this
as
a
beer
i
want
to
keep
buying
the
flavor
has
a
refreshing
crispness
to
it
i
get
more
life
from
the
flavor
than
the
aromatheres
some
coriander
and
orange
peel
with
a
more
pronounced
yeasty
ester
profile
however
it
drops
off
with
a
flat
finish
and
an
unwelcome
malty
corn
sweetness
not
one
id
have
again
trying
the
dirty
blonde
thats
how
i
like
my
blondes
anyway
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
smell
includes
orange
zest
and
floralness
the
taste
carries
much
the
same
as
the
smell
but
has
a
nice
wheat
base
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
must
downrate
this
beer
because
it
is
labeled
as
a
belgian
white
but
comes
across
more
like
a
nutbrown
very
sweet
caramel
roasted
malt
and
nut
flavor
i
was
convinced
there
was
a
bottlingline
mixup
but
it
has
the
hazy
appearance
of
a
wit
although
a
bit
more
goldenhued
than
strawcolored
i
struggle
to
find
the
orange
and
coriander
amidst
the
cloying
sugariness
and
roasted
grain
flavors
in
this
brew
if
this
were
a
nutbrown
id
probably
give
it
good
marks
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
color
was
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
2
finger
bubbly
head
head
quickly
started
to
dissapate
but
switched
to
a
thicker
foam
as
it
went
fair
amount
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
didnt
cling
at
all
aroma
was
slightly
grainy
but
also
seemed
a
bit
sour
flavor
came
across
as
a
very
watery
fruity
flavor
a
hint
of
banana
but
all
was
on
the
thin
side
felt
overly
watery
in
the
mouth
needed
a
little
more
chew
but
was
nicely
carbonated
overall
not
terrible
just
seemed
a
little
off
slight
drying
in
the
finish
forgettable
little
brew
would
be
decent
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
with
a
light
lunch
besides
that
situation
not
much
chance
i
would
go
for
this
one
again
the
crack
revealed
another
brimful
can
and
the
excitement
led
to
an
inverted
glug
it
turn
leading
to
a
fizzy
finger
of
bonewhite
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
wisps
color
was
a
hazy
lemonyellow
nose
smelled
more
like
a
wit
note
from
the
can
ale
brewed
with
orange
peel
and
coriander
thanks
to
the
adjuncts
i
definitely
caught
the
orange
peel
initially
followed
by
the
inherent
spiciness
of
the
coriander
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
much
more
like
a
wit
than
an
apwa
i
would
submit
a
correction
but
the
bfg
program
has
been
disestablished
so
apparently
the
program
will
somehow
pick
up
this
discrepancy
at
some
point
in
the
meantime
i
will
cansider
it
as
an
apwa
it
had
a
nice
orange
citrusiness
on
the
tongue
followed
by
the
peppery
spiciness
of
the
coriander
finish
was
quite
dry
very
nice
for
summer
id
take
a
dirty
blonde
to
the
beach
with
me
overall
eh
its
beer
and
its
a
little
different
which
is
good
on
a
tasting
night
like
tonight
still
wont
be
keeping
this
one
in
rotation
you
know
shes
dirty
cause
o
the
tramp
stamp
and
the
fact
shes
a
tigers
fan
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
soapy
orange
peel
light
wheat
and
a
touch
of
white
bread
the
taste
takes
this
formula
and
adds
a
healthy
amount
of
random
funk
for
lack
of
a
better
word
as
well
as
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
for
the
sake
of
it
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
meek
little
beer
one
that
just
plain
didnt
do
it
for
me
below
average
ale
due
to
imbalance
2
5
o
below
average
wheat
not
one
i
will
buy
again
d
light
thin
lemony
sort
of
a
less
than
well
done
lemony
summer
beer
not
that
anything
is
terribly
worng
but
nothing
is
very
good
either
perhaps
a
hot
weather
throw
em
back
brew
overall
decent
lawnmower
beer
but
not
on
the
buy
list
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
i
was
offered
one
at
a
party
o
good
lawnmower
beer
a
basic
wheat
beer
with
a
touch
of
fruit
to
help
out
the
ratings
are
low
but
dont
be
dissuaded
its
just
simple
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
pale
hazy
yellowgold
with
a
half
inch
bright
white
foamy
head
that
settles
rapidly
into
a
thin
film
roasted
malt
nose
with
a
slight
highlight
of
orange
citrus
and
some
spicing
but
too
faint
to
pick
out
specifics
the
beer
is
watery
with
a
cereal
roast
initial
flavor
that
stands
over
all
other
taste
profiles
there
is
a
tangy
malt
sweet
highlight
and
a
splash
of
citrus
but
all
the
flavors
seem
watered
down
overall
the
aftertaste
is
a
very
very
very
slight
citrus
tart
and
the
finish
is
blink
of
an
eye
quick
not
even
long
enough
to
think
too
much
about
the
flavors
that
arent
there
o
while
im
not
familiar
with
the
style
i
have
to
imagine
there
are
much
better
blondes
out
there
this
one
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
looked
rather
gross
and
tasted
average
perhaps
a
hot
summer
day
would
have
made
a
difference
but
not
much
would
opt
to
purchase
something
else
beer
from
the
d
pale
light
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
throgh
out
aroma
of
orange
citrus
and
fanit
spice
notes
fresh
grain
malt
summery
flavor
it
is
like
a
tasty
verson
of
a
lager
an
easy
session
beer
a
decent
drinkable
beer
to
enjoy
at
a
tigers
baseball
game
after
tasting
dirty
blonde
i
can
see
why
the
brew
was
classified
on
b
a
as
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
as
i
thought
that
a
beer
spiced
with
coriander
and
orange
should
fall
into
the
witber
style
atwater
if
you
intended
this
brew
to
be
a
witber
you
missed
the
mark
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
a
touch
of
wheat
and
oranges
taste
is
good
orange
coriander
very
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
summer
time
beer
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
light
goldenyellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
didnt
retain
much
at
all
grainy
bready
aroma
lightly
toasted
with
hints
of
citrus
zest
similar
taste
biscuity
grainy
a
yeasty
sensation
mild
wheat
profile
crisp
citrus
an
a
touch
of
spice
pretty
good
blonde
ale
but
not
really
my
style
light
body
and
fairly
drinkable
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
suppose
o
very
acidic
over
carbonated
didnt
like
this
much
but
i
could
see
a
niche
it
reminds
me
of
summer
shandy
and
lovers
of
that
might
really
like
this
too
overall
id
say
this
is
an
ok
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
for
the
price
i
was
hoping
for
something
a
litter
better
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
the
body
is
a
pale
gold
color
the
head
and
lace
are
both
frothy
white
i
was
pretty
disappointed
overall
with
almost
everything
about
this
beer
aroma
is
fruity
and
citrusy
i
thought
the
flavor
is
very
sour
and
remind
me
of
a
grapefruit
the
body
was
thin
and
watery
drinkability
while
this
beer
is
not
bad
it
is
certainly
not
good
if
i
want
some
wheat
beers
there
are
better
ones
if
i
want
something
light
and
refreshing
there
are
better
things
well
this
was
not
an
exciting
beer
the
golden
deliciousness
of
its
looks
soon
gave
way
to
a
quickly
fading
head
no
carbonation
lead
to
a
flat
taste
beer
was
not
flat
though
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
beer
with
no
ill
affects
on
the
tongue
as
it
passes
by
not
a
bad
taste
but
a
little
boring
would
probably
be
good
on
a
very
hot
day
when
all
you
want
is
something
cold
o
overall
i
feel
that
this
brew
falls
short
of
style
and
does
not
represent
a
refreshing
summer
ale
very
well
the
main
concern
i
have
is
the
astrigent
lemon
aspect
and
the
high
level
of
carbonation
that
gives
a
soda
sensation
this
is
a
slightly
older
bottle
that
a
friend
gave
me
which
they
are
still
selling
in
store
past
prime
but
still
on
the
market
maybe
it
shouldnt
be
sold
this
far
past
bottling
the
only
reason
im
giving
this
a
3
5
is
because
out
of
a
bottle
the
taste
was
stronger
i
should
have
just
kept
to
drinking
it
out
of
the
bottle
because
once
poured
this
is
a
very
unappealing
beer
great
name
and
label
but
a
boring
beer
poured
only
a
14
head
which
completely
dissipated
straw
yellow
color
not
much
of
an
aroma
at
all
even
after
warming
up
very
mild
flavor
and
yes
it
has
some
orange
peel
and
coriander
but
not
really
a
showcase
amount
of
it
wheres
the
excitement
here
folks
not
dirty
barely
blonde
overall
this
was
a
pretty
lack
luster
brew
with
not
a
lot
going
for
it
it
seems
like
this
beer
was
trying
to
be
a
nice
summer
time
witbier
like
oberon
but
instead
it
came
out
too
watered
down
i
dont
think
i
will
be
revisiting
this
brew
anytime
soon
not
a
lot
to
say
about
this
one
thats
any
better
than
average
taste
smell
are
both
thin
a
little
flawed
the
mouthfeel
is
just
kind
of
weird
cant
say
im
a
fan
pours
with
a
slight
yeasty
haze
lightgolden
color
the
initial
offwhite
head
of
about
12
inch
dissipates
almost
immediately
carbonation
is
light
the
malt
is
very
light
with
hints
of
straw
some
petillance
on
the
initial
palate
followed
by
a
light
center
and
finish
the
finish
is
rather
short
the
body
is
very
light
lace
does
not
form
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
is
not
evident
some
ale
and
wheat
characteristics
in
the
nose
albeit
very
faint
somewhat
sweet
and
slick
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
refreshing
but
exciting
this
didnt
have
the
grass
and
clove
taste
that
most
witbiers
do
but
nevertheless
its
a
good
summer
offering
because
the
abv
is
low
its
not
hard
to
down
a
few
in
a
sitting
nothing
stands
out
about
this
but
for
me
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
fitting
drink
during
the
warm
nights
that
weve
had
so
far
this
month
this
ale
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
hazy
light
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
is
not
strong
but
fairly
wheaty
and
appealing
flavor
is
firm
and
wheaty
with
a
good
citrusy
mainly
lemony
undertone
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
quite
fizzy
d
maybe
if
you
like
a
one
note
beer
made
with
a
single
spice
it
would
be
for
you
it
simply
is
not
for
me
cheers
i
picked
up
a
single
bottle
of
this
from
state
line
liquors
in
elkton
maryland
when
coming
back
from
a
trip
to
baltimore
the
appearance
is
a
honey
color
a
head
just
smaller
than
one
finger
an
good
looking
beer
smell
is
a
bit
of
citrus
but
very
faint
other
than
that
taking
a
sip
the
taste
has
lemons
but
also
a
near
soapiness
to
it
mouthfeel
has
more
of
that
citrus
which
is
nearly
overbearing
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
from
atwater
block
is
not
very
good
due
to
the
aforementioned
characteristics
overall
a
better
beer
from
atwater
normally
their
beers
have
been
pretty
bad
but
this
one
is
at
least
palatable
i
would
buy
again
if
there
was
nothing
i
havent
had
yet
and
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
refreshing
beer
drinkability
is
just
ok
it
does
go
down
easy
and
is
pretty
crisp
but
the
lack
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
doesnt
make
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
a
decent
wit
beer
especially
for
the
price
i
paid
3
50
sixpack
off
a
buddy
who
bought
a
case
thanks
neil
overall
a
decent
offering
and
better
then
i
thought
it
would
be
although
still
nothing
special
d
it
was
a
touch
overspiced
for
my
taste
which
would
keep
me
from
drinking
more
than
1
or
2
in
a
sitting
id
like
a
little
more
beer
and
less
flavoring
it
wasnt
quite
as
refreshing
as
other
examples
of
the
style
drinkability
i
suppose
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
why
would
i
want
to
cheers
d
tough
to
get
a
whole
bottle
down
atwater
usually
makes
enjoyable
stuff
but
they
missed
on
this
one
seems
to
me
that
they
tried
to
copy
sa
summer
ale
but
totally
came
up
empty
the
only
positive
thing
that
i
can
say
about
dirty
blonde
ale
is
that
it
isnt
as
horrendous
as
most
of
what
atwater
block
brews
instantly
forgettable
beer
is
preferable
sometimes
because
the
truly
wretched
ones
tend
to
stick
with
me
longer
than
id
like
misses
the
style
badly
not
impressive
when
held
to
any
standard
much
less
your
average
apwa
about
what
id
expect
from
bud
light
with
lemon
glad
i
only
bought
one
d
this
is
an
okay
wheat
beer
just
too
much
lemon
for
it
to
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
standard
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
deep
yellow
color
with
barely
a
finger
of
quickly
fading
off
white
head
nose
and
flavor
are
of
lightly
toasted
grains
sweet
dinner
rolls
very
mild
notes
of
citrus
and
spices
a
tad
thin
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
as
with
most
beers
from
this
brewery
simply
not
worth
your
time
or
calories
ontap
at
liberty
st
tavern
in
allentown
pa
appears
hazy
dark
blonde
theres
nothing
very
remarkable
about
this
beer
it
was
a
slightly
sweet
wheat
malt
flavor
so
it
kind
of
just
tastes
like
sugary
liquid
bread
no
hops
to
speak
of
and
while
its
easydrinking
and
balanced
its
not
really
a
pleasure
to
drink
it
just
does
nothing
for
me

this

the

the

okay
it

the

leaves
you
wanting
more

other

its
got
low

it
goes
down
easy
its
just
a

souracidic

a
great

not
a
mindblowing
beer

it
sure
is
smooth

from

it
was
sweet
and
the
initial

was
all
about
the
orange

hints
of

got
stronger

d
in
conclusion
i
dont
know
whether
i
personally
like
this
beer
or
not
i
got
one
of
these
for
a
friend
so
ill
be
interested
to
see
the
reaction
to
this
beer
very
few
reviews
on
here
and
the
range
is
pretty
big
overall
i
believe
this
is
sessionable
and
a
nice
summer
brew
the
other
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
have
had
a
tartsour
undertone
maybe
because
of
the
style
it
works
well
here
its
an
american
pale
wheat
with
wit
spicing
that
works
well
here
a
refreshing
summertime
brew
hazy
blonde
with
a
skim
of
white
foam
that
leaves
a
little
sliding
lace
on
the

of
dishwater
orange

faint

kind

like
an

orange

vanilla
ice

soda
with
some
mild
yeasty
funkiness
light
bodied
and
creamy
tastes
too
artificial
and
processed
for
me
overall
weak
and
watery
but
easy
to
drink
and
slightly
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
d
too
much
carbonation
im
glad
i
only
bought
3
because
they
hard
to
put
back
and
gives
you
gas
not
a
very
good
beer
i
think
atwater
has
some
issues
in
the

more

mouthfeel
was
watery
no
body
to
it
lacking
in
many
ways
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
one
as
id
yet
to
try
it
it
came
to
me
in
a
glass
and
the
foam
had
been
poured
off
this
isnt
the
fault
of
the
brewer
so
maby
it
had
great
head
the
main
problem
with
this
beer
was
infection
im
sure
it
was
an
infection
because
when
i
sniffed
it
i
thought
for
a
second
maybe
i
was
at
the
movies
about
to
dig
into
a
12
dollar
medium
popcorn
it
had
a
very
noticeable
diacetyl
aroma
and
taste
past
the
buttery
flavor
i
could
taste
blueberry
almost
which
im
sure
wasnt
intended
either
itd
be
interesting
to
taste
one
from
a
different
batch
served
in
a
tumbler
poured
a
pale
translucent
straw
color
with
lots
of
tiny
effervescent
bubbles
and
some
tiny
yeast
floaties
two
inch
rocky
white
head
began
to
collapse
within
seconds
before
settling
into
a
thin
foamy
cap
some
lacing
but
poor
adhesion
scent
was
clean
pale
wheat
some
citrus
and
a
light
hoppiness
taste
was
weak
and
watery
a
pale
comparison
of
the
nose
no
pun
intended
with
a
great
deal
of
citric
acid
coming
forth
mouthfeel
was
bitingly
astringent
and
lightbodied
carbonation
was
also
a
little
high
considering
this
brew
would
and
should
qualify
for
a
session
beer
based
on
style
and
character
i
was
dissapointed
at
how
it
all
came
together
and
how
unrefreshing
it
was
cloudy
and
muddled
light
orange
body
creamy
one
finger
white
head
lace
comes
in
droopy
rings
strong
aroma
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
its
nice
though
i
like
it
plus
some
faint
lemon
zest
and
biscuity
malt
aromas
the
flavor
is
a
little
too
high
on
the
artificial
orange
notes
theres
some
tangy
wheat
tones
as
well
a
little
too
tangy
and
sour
mouthfeel
is
a
little
flaccid
and
lifeless
this
one
is
average
at
best
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
wheat
scent
along
with
a
bit
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
its
refreshing
with
a
citrus
edge
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
dry
wheat
malt
flavor
thats
light
and
easy
drinking
its
quite
citrusy
with
just
a
hint
of
coriander
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
drinker
its
on
par
with
coors
blue
moon
this
is
pretty
lousy
not
very
pleasant
to
drink
at
all
i
wont
be
back
this
is
a
reasonable
beer
to
drink
but
not
to
impress
mouthfeel
is
smooth
light
very
easy
drinking
great
for
after
doing
something
active
in
the
hot
sun
drinkability
is
poor
as
the
taste
is
not
very
good
d
i
am
glad
i
only
got
a
single
of
this
i
guess
it
would
be
fine
on
a
really
hot
day
but
really
whats
the
point
the
best
part
about
this
is
the
label
a
new
beer
at
trader
joes
i
was
warned
that
this
wasnt
the
best
beer
we
have
over
there
boy
that
was
an
understatement
off
smells
and
flavors
are
abound
in
this
brew
rather
than
there
being
a
pronounced
orange
peel
and
coriander
flavor
i
taste
hay
and
corn
not
a
good
sign
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
water
like
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
saving
it
just
a
little
the
pale
golden
color
and
the
nice
sturdy
head
is
really
this
beers
saving
grace
oh
and
the
cartoon
lady
on
the
label
has
a
detroit
tramp
stamp
thats
awesome
not
recommended
except
for
the
bottle
serving
type

a
hazy

a
somewhat
lasting

that

j
like
great

it
was
a

i

it
amazing

and
great
taste
no
complaints
kind
of
bland
got
it
through
the
mail
service
i
use
this
is
a
pretty
typical
wheat
beer
though
a
bit
heavier
on
the
citrus
than
most
not
my
favorite
style
but
certainly
very
drinkable
these
wheatbased
beers
do
not
produce
much
in
the
way
of
lasting
head
i
initially
had
two
fingers
of
fizzing
bonewhite
head
before
it
simply
fell
to
wisps
color

very
cloudy

srm

and
i
will
readily
cop
to
agitating
it
to
get
the
lees
back
into
suspension
nose
had
a
very
pleasant
lemoniness
to
it
and
my
mouth
began
to
water
at
the
thought
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
taste
had
an
immediate
tartness
on
the
tongue
that
slowly
revealed
itself
as
its
inherent
lemony
flavor
finish
was
dry
and
even
slightly
puckering
with
a
lingering
lipsmacking
quality
another
perfect
summer
beer
that
i
wonder
how
it
would
fly
during
other
times
of
the
year
the
jack
whacker
wheat
is
a
nice
beer
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
smell
and
the
taste
had
hints
of
lemon
citrus
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
wheat
maybe
a
touch
too
fruity
for
me
but
not
bad
great
on
warmer
days
sounds
like
a
euphemism
for
something
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
very
light
grass
and
a
decent
smattering
of
watereddown
lemonade
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
lemonade
definitely
not
watereddown
anymore
its
in
your
face
together
with
a
bit
of
orange
rind
for
good
measure
things
on
the
tongue
just
spiting
the
absolute
hell
out
of
the
label
for
its
fallacious
hint
of
citrus
comment
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
just
too
much
citrus
for
this
stuff
to
work
especially
considering
the
consequent
lack
of
any
other
character
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
like
my
wheats
with
a
bit
more
velvet
overall
its
not
a
complex
flavorful
brew
but
a
nice
refreshing
option
none
the
less
tommy
knocker
makes
some
solid
beers
for
sure
if
you
are
a
hefeweizen
lover
then
its
definitely
worth
a
try
personally
i
prefer
swetty
betty
blonde
from
boulder
beer
company
mildly
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
pure
white
frothy
head
citrus
fruits
lemon
zest
wheat
grass
creamy
malts
and
molasses
in
the
aroma
sweet
citrus
uplift
and
buttery
malts
on
the
first
sip
rich
milky
mouthfeel
with
fresh
hops
thick
malts
and
lemongrass
with
a
lingering
soft
citrus
blend
sweet
citrusy
finish
a
really
wonderful
beer
edit
in
bottled
form
this
is
a
vastly
superior
to
on
tap
the
lemon
is
balanced
out
more
of
a
lemongrass
flavor
and
its
much
cleaner
to
drink
dont
write
this
off
if
the
tap
version
turned
you
off
too
im
bumping
up
a
few
scores
accordingly

poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
dark
murky
gold
with
absolutely
no
head
the
smell
was
of
light
lemon
and
wheat
and
that
was
it
the
taste
was
once
again
of
light
lemon
and
wheat
the
mouthfeel
allowed
no
other
flavors
through
it
actually
lessened
the
flavors
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
decent
for
a
wheat
ale
which
is
my
thus
far
least
favorite
type
of
beer
however
after
looking
at
the
freshness
date
which
was
07062009
i
could
understand
why
it
was
as
bland
as
it
was
i
was
drinking
it
3
years
passed
its
freshness
date
had
it
been
fresh
it
would
have
probably
been
my
favorite
wheat
ale
but
given
what
i
was
it
wasnt
that
impressive
oh
well
for
a
free
bottle
i
cant
complain
d
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
picnic
by
the
lake
or
beach
a
solid
wheat
beer
i
like
what
the
lemon
grass
imparts
to
this
brew
overall
actually
surprised
that
this
wheat
beer
had
this
much
flavor
that
was
sweet
and
somewhat
bitter
liked
it
but
couldnt
say
i
love
it
must
say
i
would
totally
recommend
it
to
a
friend
taste
a
real
disappointment
the
idea
of
lemongrass
sounded
interesting
but
the
beer
lacks
finesse
making
it
more
in
the
style
of
a
wit
might
make
it
work
better
i
personally
really
liked
this
beer
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
brewpub
in
idaho
springs
the
food
was
good
and
the
beer
was
fresh
im
not
much
for
the
appearance
or
smell
of
beer
all
i
care
about
is
whether
or
not
a
beer
tastes
goood
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
solid
wheat
ale
i
really
enjoy
the
lemon
peel
taste
that
they
add
it
had
a
nice
aroma
one
that
really
intriged
me
however
the
aroma
did
not
transalate
into
a
great
taste
the
mouthfeel
felt
a
little
heavy
for
this
style
to
me
it
almost
came
across
as
sour
ive
had
beers
with
lemon
grass
before
and
i
did
not
get
that
same
tastemouthfeel
i
actually
gave
this
beer
3
tries
before
rating
it
i
wanted
to
be
able
give
it
a
good
unbiased
rating
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
would
not
pick
up
another
one
cheers
pours
a
hazy
soft
golden
with
zero
head
looks
like
apple
cider
smells
like
moldy
hay
tastes
like
a
crappy
cider
with
a
heap
of
metallic
zest
that
bumps
the
roof
of
the
mouth
no
carbonation
really
overall
a
shitty
shitty
beer
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
happened
here
what
am
i
suppose
to
do
with
the
other
5
medium
bodied
at
best
with
a
strong
astringency
and
high
effervescence
a
lot
of
lemon
in
the
aftertaste
with
some
weaker
malt
a
decent
beer
along
the
lines
of
a
blue
moon
with
an
astringent
streak
just
unimpressive
all
around
every
thought
i
had
comparitively
was
not
a
beer
i
do
like
wheat
ales
but
this
one
is
a
major
step
down
for
me
there
are
absolutely
much
better
ones
out
there
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
any
situation
and
especially
for
the
one
described
above
ironically
although
i
dont
typically
do
this
with
wheats
and
did
not
intend
to
i
let
it
get
a
little
warmer
before
i
finished
it
in
my
opinion
the
taste
and
aroma
of
this
beer
was
accentuated
by
the
raised
temperature
i
know
that
sounds
more
like
an
imperial
or
other
stronger
style
but
im
serious
i
really
think
it
was
better
at
a
warmer
temp
i
would
recommend
this
beer
its
just
as
good
as
many
of
the
american
pale
wheats
i
have
had
overall
dont
know
if
this
beer
is
marketed
as
a
summer
ale
regardless
if
it
isnt
this
might
be
your
year
round
go
to
tastes
great
and
flavor
to
carbonation
is
evenly
distributed
hope
you
all
enjoy
this
is
a
pretty
standard
light
simple
wheat
beer
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
and
the
apple
juice
notes
arent
pleasing
i
probably
wont
have
this
again
o
for
some
reason
ive
had
a
hard
time
finding
an
american
wheat
ale
that
i
have
liked
i
definitely
like
this
one
flavors
are
really
nice
and
stray
away
from
the
traditional
overcitrusy
ales
o
i
really
like
this
beer
lemon
taste
is
a
touch
strong
so
you
need
to
like
lemons
to
really
enjoy
great
warm
weather
beer
or
after
any
work
at
all
overall
this
beer
is
alright
but
nothing
special
i
definitely
wont
buy
it
on
its
own
however
if
this
is
the
weak
link
in
a
variety
6pack
i
think
i
can
deal
with
that
overall
a
nice
wheat
ale
worth
a
try
but
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
up
a
sixer
until
next
summer
this
ones
pretty
good
actually
the
body
of
this
beer
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
with
more
heft
and
depth
than
most
apwas
its
gently
crisp
and
a
bit
smooth
overall
impression
meh
another
overly
filtered
wheat
with
some
citrus
added
definitely
mediocre
overall
i
would
move
on
to
another
overall
a
good
sessionable
wheat
ale
i
love
the
maltiness
in
this
one
this
one
is
subtle
but
is
one
of
tommyknockers
better
brews
overall
pretty
good
for
this
style
but
the
style
doesnt
suit
me
o
this
is
a
pretty
decent
wheat
beer
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
on
any
hot
summer
day
dr
well
priced
and
very
drinkable
but
of
mundane
quality
id
have
it
again
if
it
were
well
priced
would
likely
be
better
on
draught
overall
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
since
it
is
more
yeast
forward
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
good
enjoying
two
in
a
row
so
session
able
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
it
just
needs
another
layer
of
complexity
to
make
it
great
hops
yeast
malt
it
just
needs
a
contribution
from
something
else
not
bad
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
delicious
and
flavorful
a
real
winner
and
good
session
candidate
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
without
complaint
the
lemongrass
is
a
great
touch
definitely
worth
trying
this
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
mainly
banana
with
hints
of
lemon
and
dough
the
flavor
is
lemony
with
banana
cake
and
some
nutty
notes
it
has
a
lightmedium
mouthfeel
light
and
very
smooth
tommyknocker
jack
whacker
wheat
ale
is
a
very
good
beer
represents
the
style
well
and
is
very
enjoyable
highly
recommended
o
this
is
by
far
the
best
american
wheat
i
have
ever
had
i
love
the
flavor
that
lemongrass
brings
to
the
drink
and
how
refreshing
this
beer
is
perfect
for
chilling
out
during
summer
great
beer
probably
decent
on
a
hot
day
but
still
not
what
it
could
have
been
had
the
brewer
laid
off
the
bubbles
this
one
is
just
so
refreshing
a
nice
addition
to
my
palate
after
a
long
day
at
work
this
is
average
tasting
at
best
a
summer
beer
for
sure
this
could
be
a
session
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
since
it
isnt
horrible
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
this
was
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
i
havent
had
a
wheat
beer
that
tasted
similar
to
this
i
feel
like
the
addition
of
lemon
grass
is
what
made
this
beer
stick
out
i
have
never
had
a
beer
brewed
with
that
before
but
i
wouldnt
mind
checking
out
some
more
beers
that
utilize
lemon
grass
especially
a
wheat
beer
i
liked
jack
wacker
and
it
ranks
up
there
as
one
of
the
better
ones
from
the
six
pack
so
far
i
would
buy
this
again
with
all
the
citrus
notes
in
this
beer
i
think
it
would
make
a
good
summertime
brew
i
would
recommend
this
people
who
like
wheat
beers
that
are
heavy
on
the
citrus
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
fast
no
lace
smells
good
wheat
grapes
and
lemon
sweeter
than
expected
sweet
pilsner
malts
honey
and
wheat
with
a
background
hint
of
citrus
probably
the
lemon
grass
not
a
faint
beer
but
nice
and
light
refreshing
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
poured
in
a
bayernweissbier
glass
look
dull
golden
color
two
finger
of
foam
with
david
the
gnome
on
the
logo
smell
cirtus
with
some
sweetness
taste
wheat
lemon
peel
sugar
mouthfeel
refreshing
and
citrus
sometimes
sweet
medium
body
and
slight
carbonation
drinkability
tasty
and
off
thirst
but
something
simple
this
was
a
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
beer
with
good
flavor
tommyknocker
jack
whacker
wheat
ale
was
golden
in
color
and
very
hazy
with
fine
particles
floating
about
it
had
a
large
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
mainly
lemons
the
taste
was
lemony
as
well
with
some
light
malt
wheat
and
a
dry
lightly
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
medium
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
above
average
this
is
a
good
wheat
beer
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
the
high
carbonation
completely
throws
this
one
off
assuming
it
doesnt
ruin
the
drinking
experience
for
you
the
beer
is
relatively
light
and
fairly
low
in
abv
so
it
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
unfortunately
its
not
a
beer
that
would
make
the
session
very
enjoyable
notes
this
beer
does
not
remind
me
of
any
other
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
really
sticks
out
as
unique
i
was
put
off
by
the
goofy
label
on
the
bottle
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
tastes
great
on
draft
as
well
recommended
pleasing
and
somewhat
interesting
but
not
enough
oomph
to
be
memorable
on
the
other
hand
very
easygoing
and
easy
to
down
but
the
sweetness
builds
up
too
easily
somewhat
like
a
more
restrained
version
of
leinenkugels
berry
weiss
crossed
with
a
subdued
magic
hat
circus
boy
d
drinkable
yes
enjoyable
not
sure
drinkability
interesting
taste
but
perhaps
a
bad
bottle
i
may
come
back
and
reevaluate
my
review
when
i
can
next
find
another
bottle
drinkability
nice
and
would
definitely
drink
this
again
just
an
over
all
good
wheat
but
there
are
ones
that
are
better
but
again
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
one
and
should
be
tried
conclusion
nothing
is
wrong
with
this
example
of
the
style
but
i
cant
find
one
thing
about
it
to
praise
however
the
lemongrass
is
interesting
and
if
you
like
lemongrass
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
beer
i
like
thai
food
and
thus
i
like
lemongrass
d
the
appearance
was
a
little
weak
but
the
rest
came
through
with
an
outstanding
flavour
coming
as
a
great
surprise
highly
recommended
to
any
wheat
ale
fan
or
anyone
looking
for
a
fruity
twist
to
their
bevy
d
considering
it
doesnt
really
have
a
taste
it
is
real
easy
to
drink
just
not
very
enjoyable
my
300th
review
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
small
white
head
aromas
are
big
on
the
sourdough
bread
dough
and
yeast
not
nearly
as
wheaty
as
many
wheat
beers
but
definitely
pleasant
and
interesting
lots
of
carbonation
on
the
palate
that
wasnt
apparent
on
the
head
tastes
like
a
buttered
piece
of
sourdough
bread
with
just
a
dab
of
honey
its
somewhat
wheaty
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
many
other
wheat
beers
i
agree
with
the
reviewers
who
said
that
it
has
a
chalky
element
to
its
taste
the
uniqueness
of
its
flavor
profile
makes
it
fun
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
want
another
d
could
very
well
drink
a
few
pints
of
these
no
preob
pours
a
clouded
apricot
hue
orange
golden
really
with
a
large
bubbled
thicket
of
bright
white
head
lacing
is
sporadic
and
finely
speckled
aroma
has
a
nice
citric
note
between
the
typical
yeast
character
and
the
lemongrass
adjuncts
smell
has
a
really
nie
bready
wheat
tone
to
it
flavor
really
is
nice
brings
an
earthy
grass
feel
with
the
citrusbready
wheat
profile
yeast
gives
a
bit
of
chalky
character
amongst
everything
else
going
on
slightly
spicy
finish
this
brew
would
pair
nicely
with
some
thai
food
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
with
carbonation
really
cleans
the
palate
with
fine
bubbles
sharp
acidity
does
add
a
bit
of
dryness
a
nice
light
bodied
wheat
ale
that
does
a
good
job
of
not
being
a
boring
bland
pale
wheat
ale
that
ive
come
to
expect
with
most
american
micros
drinkability
overall
was
solid
especially
after
being
outdoors
for
most
of
the
early
part
of
today
i
needed
something
refreshing
to
go
with
my
water
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
wheat
and
perfume
not
what
i
expected
and
not
very
good
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
flowers
and
perfume
notes
to
go
along
with
wheat
and
some
grassy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
one
i
wish
to
try
again
one
of
the
more
favorable
wheats
that
i
have
had
you
know
i
could
down
this
easy
on
a
hot
day
its
not
hot
today
and
this
is
just
pizza
beer
ok
all
in
all
though
there
are
a
few
great
pale
wheat
brews
this
brew
defines
the
pale
wheat
genre
for
me
personally
without
a
doubt
i
think
that
this
beer
is
an
a
beer
golden
bodied
brew
slight
haze
but
mostly
clear
small
white
head
doesnt
last
very
long
filtered
wheat
wheat
grain
nose
some
citrus
hints
and
a
bit
of
banana
wheat
malt
pretty
much
owns
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
the
ole
bubblegum
thing
going
on
not
much
in
the
way
of
malts
kinda
thin
on
the
mouth
but
overall
pretty
refreshing
and
tasty
d
high
i
could
have
two
or
three
of
these
in
a
row
without
feeling
weighed
down
which
i
cant
say
for
blue
moon
while
some
wheat
beers
are
complimented
by
a
twist
of
orange
i
think
this
beer
is
best
on
its
own
i
can
picture
myself
picking
up
a
six
pack
of
this
for
a
party
or
just
to
enjoy
on
my
own
drinkability
is
relatively
high
the
flavor
profile
is
ok
the
abv
is
low
making
this
sessionable
its
an
ok
drinking
experience
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
a
wheat
this
was
a
recommendaton
by
the
bartender
during
the
summer
his
presentation
sparked
my
interest
but
his
serving
of
the
beer
was
even
more
important
he
put
the
pint
glass
upside
down
on
top
of
the
bottle
flip
them
around
so
the
bottle
was
now
upside
down
and
poured
slowly
in
a
circular
motion
for
the
wheat
once
finished
he
spun
the
bottle
back
and
forth
palms
of
hand
on
the
bottle
mr
miyagi
stlye
to
collapse
the
wheat
and
pour
the
foamy
head
on
top
then
garnished
with
a
slice
of
lemon
do
it
this
way
to
capture
all
the
flavors
and
enjoy
a
great
beer
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
looking
for
something
different
it
pours
a
near
clear
yellow
so
my
expectations
for
wheat
flavor
immediately
lowered
the
bouquet
promised
lemongrass
which
was
readily
apparent
upon
first
sip
however
that
is
all
that
was
present
in
this
thin
beer
i
could
see
how
people
would
love
it
on
a
warm
day
as
a
session
beer
but
a
single
bottle
i
didnt
feel
it
was
an
attention
grabber
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
lemons
taste
is
also
of
lemons
tart
some
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
not
bad
but
definatly
nothing
great
poured
into
sam
smith
nonic
hazy
orange
color
dominates
with
finger
white
head
leaving
negligible
lacing
smell
is
of
orange
and
coriander
and
taste
is
unsurprisingly
orange
and
coriander
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
this
is
a
sessionable
yet
average
beer
the
most
disappointing
out
of
the
sampler
d
nothing
really
flawed
with
this
beer
but
nothing
making
it
stand
out
and
make
me
want
another
d
moderate
to
high
drinkability
the
flavors
are
well
nonexistent
at
times
avoid
palette
fatigue
lightly
filling
drinkability
in
this
occasion
may
not
be
a
compliment
d
this
is
an
easy
drinker
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
intrigued
if
i
want
a
light
wheat
beer
this
is
just
what
im
looking
for
d
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
sweet
not
something
i
would
drink
too
much
of
i
can
think
of
more
balanced
wheat
ales
that
i
think
are
more
complex
that
i
would
rather
have
interesting
idea
with
the
lemon
grass
but
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
pours
a
yellow
hazy
color
with
a
half
finger
to
finger
head
the
smell
is
of
wheat
and
some
fruity
notes
but
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
smell
to
be
had
the
taste
is
bland
and
kinda
watery
the
taste
is
wheat
with
a
hint
of
maybe
coriander
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
overly
carbonated
and
it
is
slightly
too
watery
the
overall
drinkability
of
the
beer
is
about
average
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
but
there
is
too
much
water
and
not
enough
guts
to
this
beer
d
very
refreshing
i
could
drink
these
all
day
drink
ability
is
barely
above
average
it
is
session
able
but
very
boring
glad
i
bought
this
for
99
cents
would
not
spend
any
more
on
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
almost
no
lacing
very
disappointing
for
a
wheat
beer
the
aroma
has
a
faint
wheaty
tang
to
it
but
really
nothing
else
the
taste
is
has
a
more
pronounced
wheatiness
than
the
arome
with
the
addition
of
some
nice
lemony
citrus
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
a
little
too
high
overall
this
is
a
decent
american
wheat
beer
at
best
i
would
be
upset
if
i
had
to
drink
this
again
but
i
would
be
excited
either
solid
choice
for
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
for
a
wheat
ale
not
a
bad
one
for
a
hot
summer
day
gets
better
as
it
warms
more
of
the
wheat
malt
come
out
easily
drinkable
if
you
like
wheat
ales
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
12
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
wheat
pale
malt
some
citrus
flavors
lemon
and
some
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
really
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
tastes
of
lemon
up
front
but
not
just
lemon
juice
its
more
of
a
lemon
with
a
zestyearthy
kick
probably
from
the
lemon
grass
added
after
the
lemon
comes
some
slight
spice
and
then
finishes
with
a
smooth
sweet
malt
flavor
the
initial
zest
on
the
tongue
is
intriguing
and
along
with
the
smooth
finish
this
beer
is
amazingly
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
really
good
brew
that
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
worth
a
try
on
a
bad
note
it
does
not
get
better
with
warmth
actually
quite
the
reverse
great
balanced
feel
on
the
palate
a
bit
watery
goes
down
smooth
with
no
unpleasant
after
taste
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
by
far
the
best
thing
ive
had
from
tommyknocker
the
drinkability
was
pretty
great
and
would
be
the
perfect
day
to
enjoy
after
a
day
on
the
mountain
or
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
am
usually
a
bigger
fan
of
belgian
style
wheats
but
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
american
wheats
i
have
had
d
lemon
grass
and
wheat
ale
seems
to
be
a
winning
combination
mild
in
character
but
with
likable
nuances
i
could
slam
about
a
billion
of
these
in
the
summertime
drinkability
a
slightly
toned
down
carbonation
would
for
me
be
appreciate
otherwise
its
a
fairly
pleasant
wheat
ale
d
very
drinkable
beer
in
a
drinkable
style
especially
since
its
local
this
will
make
a
summer
session
beer
for
the
back
yard
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
this
beer
but
it
could
be
a
decent
session
beer
nikki
i
dont
mean
to
knock
this
beer
so
hard
cuz
the
idea
is
really
neat
but
something
went
wrong
with
the
batch
this
one
came
from
id
like
to
try
it
again
on
tap
or
from
a
new
bottle
as
it
stands
though
this
one
is
not
good
at
all
taste
is
a
nice
wheat
with
overtones
of
citrus
little
malt
and
a
slight
hint
of
esters
and
citrus
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
d
this
beer
just
didnt
excite
me
that
much
decent
for
a
session
but
not
one
im
anxious
to
revisit
im
still
convinced
that
this
style
is
meant
to
be
a
safe
microbrew
starting
point
for
the
macro
drinker
my
mom
certainly
liked
it
d
fine
for
an
american
wheat
ale
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
like
most
of
this
style
md
to
me
it
was
too
much
wheat
to
be
drinkable
for
more
than
a
few
this
one
was
sort
of
bland
for
me
a
pretty
high
abv
for
a
pale
wheat
ale
and
is
very
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
having
this
on
a
nice
hot
day
as
a
beer
though
its
a
little
boring
aroma
and
taste
wise
and
can
definitely
be
improved
one
of
the
better
beers
from
this
brewery
though
d
very
high
this
beer
goes
down
easy
as
water
but
tastes
much
better
very
refreshing
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
i
think
ill
look
for
it
again
it
was
a
decent
price
overall
light
but
quite
tasty
very
good
for
a
bbq
beer
cloudy
gold
colored
ale
with
a
slowly
fading
head
i
got
nothing
on
aroma
taste
is
very
weak
and
bland
i
got
some
lemon
and
wheat
but
again
not
strong
at
all
i
cant
say
that
this
is
bad
or
goodtheres
not
much
to
work
with
probably
as
average
and
boring
as
a
beer
can
get
a
light
goldyellow
with
a
twofinger
head
that
died
quickly
a
stronger
sweet
malt
smell
than
most
pale
wheats
but
real
lemon
and
clovespice
come
through
a
light
to
medium
body
a
little
slick
for
my
taste
with
an
intense
almost
overpowering
lemon
bite
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
wit
for
a
second
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
i
just
thought
the
lemongrass
overpowered
the
brew
a
little
taking
away
from
the
malts
and
the
wheat
the
addition
of
lemon
grass
gives
this
brew
its
distinctive
flavor
without
it
itd
be
a
really
subpar
wheat
still
look
to
maybe
magic
hats
hocus
pocus
for
a
better
example
of
the
style
overall
excellent
wheat
beer
very
drinkable
very
well
balanced
hv
d
this
is
pretty
good
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
hefeweizen
instead
of
an
american
wheat
ale
d
this
is
a
nice
wheat
great
on
a
100
degree
day
d
goes
down
easy
strong
wheat
flavor
meh
its
alright
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
appropriate
and
the
drink
soft
and
flavorful
with
good
drinkability
d
drinkable
but
the
lemon
textures
might
get
a
little
old
after
a
few
could
definitely
put
down
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
day
though
drinkability
i
kinda
like
this
one
and
it
drinks
real
easy
might
pick
it
up
again
in
the
future
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
medium
foamy
head
on
a
lovely
cloudy
body
lemon
comes
through
in
initial
sniffs
wheat
not
so
much
rather
faint
theres
a
funk
to
the
smell
as
well
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
taste
is
about
the
same
minus
the
funk
which
was
a
good
thing
again
the
wheat
was
a
tad
underwhelming
thickness
was
also
a
tad
low
at
least
as
far
a
wheats
go
a
good
beer
not
among
the
greats
but
certainly
drinkable
very
pleased
they
got
lemon
balanced
just
right
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
in
the
aroma
banana
and
small
hints
of
citrus
in
the
taste
dry
banana
small
clove
presence
and
just
a
small
bitterness
a
nice
bitterness
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
clove
and
citrusy
aftertaste
a
nice
balance
good
flavor
a
really
nice
wheat
d
i
think
the
lemon
is
a
lil
bit
overkill
with
this
brew
but
it
is
still
decent
i
think
it
is
just
a
tad
too
much
acidic
but
that
could
just
be
my
thoughts
i
could
only
do
two
or
three
of
these
before
my
stomach
would
be
turning
knots
cloudy
yellow
color
with
zero
head
and
therefore
no
lace
not
looking
very
good
but
the
smell
holds
some
promise
fresh
clean
smell
the
bottle
says
lemon
grass
is
added
and
you
can
easily
pick
it
up
along
with
a
light
grainyness
taste
matches
the
smell
but
is
a
little
underwhelming
mouth
is
clean
but
somehow
manages
to
not
be
watery
a
nice
summer
brew
which
is
what
i
think
they
set
out
to
make
so
ill
give
it
a
thumbs
up
worth
a
try
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
good
a
nice
session
wheat
beer
worth
keeping
a
six
pack
around
for
a
warm
day
very
easy
to
drink
sor
tof
a
weak
mouthfeel
but
definetely
nice
on
a
summer
day
a
little
bit
more
crispness
and
fullness
of
flavor
might
make
the
beer
more
drinkability
overall
well
drinkable
im
not
a
fan
of
wheat
ales
but
this
is
pretty
solid
and
something
that
i
would
consider
drinking
more
often
especially
as
a
summertime
brew
d
a
really
solid
wheat
beer
excellent
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
like
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
like
them
less
sweet
d
an
enjoyable
pale
wheat
ale
there
are
others
i
would
drink
over
this
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
d
quite
drinkable
because
its
so
light
just
a
little
too
much
abv
for
a
session
beer
but
id
be
willing
to
fake
it
drinkability
is
once
again
nothing
special
but
i
think
all
wheat
beers
are
pretty
damn
drinkable
espcially
in
the
summer
so
i
bump
it
up
from
average
not
bad
but
nothing
above
and
beyond
a
pretty
nice
brew
the
lemon
grass
is
a
nice
touch
good
foam
4
an
american
wheat
a
cross
between
a
witbier
and
a
fruity
kolsch
a
saving
grace
from
tommy
skippy
and
his
lunch
this
would
be
good
at
a
bbq
on
a
warm
day
decent
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
tommyknocker
jack
whacker
wheat
is
a
pleasant
surprise
the
presentation
is
mediocre
with
a
thin
layer
of
white
head
leaving
town
way
too
fast
over
a
yellowgolden
body
very
nice
aroma
with
some
fruitiness
and
a
decent
hop
load
im
impressed
with
the
taste
more
hopped
than
i
expected
but
balanced
by
tasty
fruitorange
lemon
especially
creamy
smooth
this
is
a
terrific
accompaniment
to
a
warm
weekend
day
delicious
one
ill
be
sure
to
grab
again
as
the
weather
warms
a
pretty
decent
all
around
brew
this
style
isnt
my
favorite
admittedly
but
it
was
rather
interesting
i
have
found
that
a
lot
of
these
have
a
random
spice
that
they
kind
of
make
dominate
the
beer
this
beer
chose
lemon
grass
and
it
was
delicious
the
smell
has
a
lot
of
the
lemony
smell
but
a
bit
earthier
in
the
taste
the
earthiness
is
stronger
than
the
lemon
however
i
like
both
so
i
wont
complain
a
bit
light
on
mouthfeel
but
on
par
for
the
style
initial
lemon
zing
followed
by
hops
bitterness
results
in
a
complex
but
balanced
taste
this
would
be
a
great
beer
pool
side
the
lemon
grasswheat
thing
is
still
going
on
sweeter
than
i
expected
as
i
had
the
assumption
the
lemon
grass
would
provide
tartness
it
does
however
counterpoint
the
sweetness
a
bit
and
the
beer
has
an
easydrinking
wheat
smoothness
to
it
not
much
hop
or
pop
but
i
appreciate
whats
going
on
here
probably
one
of
tommyknockers
better
offerings
id
take
some
fishing
or
golfing
would
be
good
with
a
veggiefruit
tray
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
breweries
best
beers
well
balanced
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
a
glowing
golden
with
a
silky
white
head
aromas
of
citrus
fruits
and
light
malts
body
is
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
still
full
on
the
palate
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
bready
malts
floral
hops
and
tart
fruit
slightly
light
golden
color
with
a
fairly
thin
head
atop
smell
is
light
nice
wheatiness
along
with
some
tart
lemony
note
taste
is
also
a
touch
tart
with
a
sweet
honey
wheat
like
kick
to
it
as
well
i
tend
to
like
american
wheats
although
theyre
not
generally
a
highly
rated
snobby
beer
and
id
say
this
one
was
above
average
i
thought
it
was
quite
good
while
slightly
unique
for
the
style
and
would
get
it
again
edit
after
savoring
another
i
noticed
aftertaste
and
finish
going
a
little
thin
and
lowered
taste
and
drinkability
s
a
notch
still
a
very
nice
beer
though
d
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
wheats
just
not
much
my
style
but
this
was
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
and
i
wouldve
had
another
had
this
not
been
the
last
one
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
very
little
head
smell
has
some
fruity
aromas
goes
down
extremely
smooth
and
is
a
little
dry
on
the
tongue
taste
is
very
malty
with
some
hints
of
fruit
im
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
i
really
liked
this
one
i
only
expected
a
lot
more
head
for
a
wheat
beer
regardless
this
one
should
be
given
a
try
part
of
the
trail
mix
6
pack
unfiltered
evidently
bottled
61307
per
the
notching
on
the
label
pours
out
to
a
very
clear
deep
golden
forming
a
creamy
white
head
which
has
good
retention
and
good
lacing
carbonation
is
moderate
the
aroma
is
rather
nondistinct
definitely
an
american
wheat
smells
like
a
pyramid
product
some
suggestion
of
orange
peel
and
corn
oh
now
i
see
its
brewed
with
lemon
grass
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
a
little
sizzly
refreshingly
light
bodied
and
clean
well
whats
to
say
its
a
beer
theres
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
going
on
some
distant
pale
malts
crackers
some
yeasty
fruity
esters
a
little
citrus
finish
is
lightly
sweet
and
the
aftertaste
suggests
adjuncts
and
a
hint
of
metal
best
served
ice
cold
because
as
it
warms
they
all
become
more
apparent
nothing
i
would
ever
care
to
have
again
di
would
love
to
drink
this
beer
again
it
has
a
very
interesting
taste
and
a
light
body
drinkability
probably
ok
on
a
warm
summer
day
not
a
cold
winter
night
still
not
real
good
one
is
enough
and
i
will
probably
not
seek
this
out
again
overall
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
mix
pack
will
definitly
get
again
probably
on
a
nice
summer
day
it
would
do
well
with
me
overall
a
very
strong
offering
from
tommy
knockers
i
have
had
a
couple
off
ones
lately
but
this
seemed
to
restore
my
hope
that
they
are
putting
out
some
quality
products
not
the
best
i
have
ever
had
but
nowhere
near
the
worst
i
would
grab
for
this
one
again
without
hesitation
if
it
were
around
d
very
drinkable
beer
smooth
and
crisp
the
aftertaste
doesnt
build
up
a
great
session
beer
oelergud
d
falls
below
the
medium
in
terms
of
a
wheat
beer
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
enjoyed
most
of
the
tommyknocker
brews
that
i
poured
at
the
charlotte
oktoberfest
however
the
wheat
was
not
to
my
fancy
nothing
spectacular
though
a
lot
of
the
girls
who
needed
something
light
enjoyed
this
medium
straw
color
that
looked
mostly
filtered
easy
to
consume
good
choice
ona
hot
summer
day
apparently
a
jack
whacker
had
the
job
of
whipping
the
last
mule
to
keep
the
supply
train
moving
along
in
mining
camps
i
bought
this
beer
thinking
it
was
something
completely
different
damn
marketing
campaigns
i
try
very
hard
to
not
slam
a
beer
but
there
is
nothing
going
on
with
this
one
this
is
better
than
bmc
but
not
much
i
am
glad
only
only
have
1
of
these
thanks
to
pegasus
for
the
karma
point
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
hazy
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
aroma
is
dirty
diaper
and
slight
cloves
flavor
mimics
the
aroma
soiled
underpants
with
slight
lemon
and
citrus
flavors
average
mouthfeel
not
really
drinkable
another
dud
from
tommyknocker
d
not
quite
up
to
par
there
are
better
apwas
to
be
had
one
and
done
for
me
this
is
a
beer
that
has
no
reason
to
exist
poured
into
a
wehat
glass
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
bit
of
a
head
that
doesnt
hang
around
to
long
little
yeast
particles
float
around
smell
is
slight
citrusy
with
sweet
amber
in
there
as
well
also
a
bit
of
wheat
the
taste
is
pretty
good
nice
and
smooth
and
goes
down
extremly
well
taste
of
slight
bitterness
lemon
twang
also
a
bit
of
lime
in
there
this
is
a
pretty
good
offering
and
the
drinkability
is
amazing
you
could
littlerly
go
through
a
bunch
of
these
in
no
time
the
beer
pours
a
bright
clear
gold
color
with
a
few
small
yeast
chunks
floating
a
fizzy
bleached
white
head
foams
up
1
cm
and
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
surface
layer
aroma
is
some
lemon
zest
and
tangy
wheat
with
also
a
bit
of
general
sugar
sweetness
the
first
sip
reveals
a
light
crisp
body
with
fine
tingly
carbonation
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
light
sweetness
some
mild
wheat
twang
and
a
bit
of
lemon
overall
mild
and
crisp
good
for
a
hot
day
but
not
overly
interesting
in
terms
of
flavor
no
hint
of
5
5
abv
so
could
be
easily
sessionable
nothing
more
to
say
big
disappointment
not
a
bad
drinking
beer
just
not
much
of
a
wheat
beer
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
crisp
light
with
reasonable
balance
but
overall
not
a
lot
of
flavor
really
drinkability
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
but
i
dont
think
there
is
really
enough
here
to
make
me
want
to
try
another
drinkability
good
i
found
that
after
a
couple
the
lemony
taste
starts
to
were
on
you
all
an
all
a
good
beer
a
nice
wheat
beer
with
whispers
of
citrus
thanks
to
the
addition
of
lemon
grass
color
is
cloudy
amber
so
you
know
it
hasnt
been
filtered
aroma
has
a
hint
of
lemon
as
does
the
taste
which
is
typical
of
a
wheat
beer
pleasant
and
uncomplex
it
has
just
a
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
good
for
spring
or
summer
outings
the
mouth
is
very
low
carbonation
which
also
hurts
this
beer
drinability
suffers
from
the
beers
flaws
not
a
beer
i
will
be
searching
for
and
goes
down
nice
the
pour
into
my
blanche
de
chambly
glass
raises
a
1
5
finger
head
over
a
hazy
yellow
gold
body
looking
much
like
the
pils
i
had
earlier
the
head
though
doesnt
last
long
especially
for
a
wheat
beer
it
falls
after
a
minute
or
two
to
surface
lacing
but
manages
to
leave
some
nice
tracks
on
the
glasss
sides
the
nose
has
a
lemonpepper
smell
to
it
but
is
quite
mild
in
all
categories
the
lemon
is
very
noticeable
and
actually
adds
a
very
interesting
dimension
to
this
beer
theres
a
lot
of
sweetness
too
but
not
anything
usually
associated
with
wheat
beers
still
its
a
fun
departure
the
mouth
is
light
with
a
mellow
carbonation
i
think
the
lower
carbonation
helps
the
soft
lemon
flavor
come
through
more
clearly
a
fun
and
refreshing
beer
which
would
be
even
better
in
warm
weather
a
nice
option
when
the
weather
warms
but
nothing
special
here
pours
a
very
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
white
three
finger
head
that
held
for
a
short
time
then
settled
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
of
fruit
and
citrus
lemon
grass
comes
right
out
but
cant
pick
anything
else
out
of
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
slight
lemon
after
taste
i
would
buy
it
again
as
a
summer
refresher
again
from
the
motherlode
12
pack
mix
poured
a
hazy
yellow
gray
in
the
glass
with
a
soft
creamcolored
head
that
disappeared
quickly
clean
smelling
i
guess
i
expected
more
lemon
seeing
lemongrass
on
the
label
as
an
ingredient
but
the
lemon
taste
was
very
subdued
almost
smooth
in
its
subtlety
obvious
wheat
taste
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
again
thanks
to
the
wheat
but
surprisingly
drinkable
and
tasty
i
find
that
if
i
enjoy
every
sip
looking
forward
to
the
next
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
give
the
beer
a
thumbs
up
this
was
not
all
that
complex
in
flavor
but
everything
was
so
well
balanced
that
it
was
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
like
tommyknockers
glacier
lager
i
would
buy
this
for
the
summer
barbeque
another
solid
beer
from
tommyknocker
drinkability
easy
session
pick
but
its
on
the
pricy
side
at
close
to
8
a
sixer
pours
a
nice
strawyellow
into
my
duvel
glass
a
substantial
head
of
at
least
a
quarterinch
formed
but
it
didnt
last
long
i
always
like
the
view
of
sediment
swirling
at
the
bottom
of
any
beer
the
aroma
is
of
fruity
citrus
and
lemongrass
but
its
very
light
overall
i
found
the
initial
flavor
to
be
quite
enjoyable
it
was
crisp
and
bright
with
lemon
wheat
and
light
summer
fruit
dominating
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
as
well
with
a
subtle
cloying
effect
followed
by
a
warm
sensation
that
outlasted
the
aftertaste
the
only
negative
aspect
to
this
beer
is
that
it
weakened
in
flavor
over
the
45
minutes
i
sipped
it
by
the
end
almost
no
big
flavor
characteristic
stood
out
and
the
aftertaste
vanished
not
bad
interesting
to
try
dnot
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expectingits
more
like
a
spiced
ale
to
me
i
have
another
but
probably
not
a
sessionable
beer
overall
it
was
decent
poured
a
cloudy
light
apricot
color
with
massive
white
puffy
head
smell
is
very
light
with
only
a
mild
fruity
sweetness
to
be
found
taste
is
also
very
mild
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
lemon
grass
and
a
moderate
tartness
to
balance
it
finish
is
nice
and
full
in
the
mouth
and
very
refreshing
a
nice
beer
for
a
warm
eary
autumn
afternoon
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
offwhite
head
above
the
almost
clear
golden
amber
brew
head
fades
gradually
with
frothy
lacing
aroma
is
lightly
flowery
wheat
taste
follows
along
slightly
floral
almost
sickly
sweet
wheat
flavor
with
a
chalky
close
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
okay
but
this
is
not
something
i
would
search
out
again
the
drinkability
is
good
i
like
the
taste
i
will
add
this
is
no
german
hefe
but
they
dont
say
it
is
this
is
a
very
good
american
wheat
better
then
most
mk
this
is
an
interesting
wheat
you
can
definitely
say
that
it
is
not
bland
unlike
most
other
american
wheat
beers
there
is
a
lot
of
noticeable
lemongrass
and
other
seasonings
added
to
it
the
lingering
aftertaste
may
be
a
bit
disagreeable
but
its
not
a
huge
deal
if
it
didnt
have
all
the
extra
spices
etc
added
to
it
it
would
be
pretty
boring
but
at
the
very
least
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
out
of
curiosity

slight

very

taste

the
lemongrass
definitely
dominating
upfront
very
light
yeastiness
a
bit
of
wheat
and
a
lingering
lemon
finish
very
different
from
an
normal
american
wheat
a
little
offputting
on
the
first
sip
but
the
taste
grew
on
me
and
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
light
and
crisp
this
makes
a
good
thirst
quencher
on

hot

day

aroma

contribution

into

from

into
a
weizen
glass
cloudy
smells
like
lemons
followed
by
a
hint
of
wheat
the
taste
is
pretty
muchy
the
same
a
strong
taste
of
lemon
as
well
as
a
taste
of
wheat
a
moderate
beer
with
a
nice
crisp

perfect

a
fairly
tasty
beer
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
maybe
the
best
ive
had
from
tommyknockers
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
not
terrible
if
you
want
something
very
lemony
without
any
citrusy
sweetness
good
hot
weather
beer
for
sure
flavor
had
a
good
wallop
of
lemongrass
not
as
bad
as
a
streetside

soup
but
more
of
a
hint
personally
i
didnt
care
for
it
felt
overly
perfumy
then
citrusy
with
some

not

not

i

that

this

falls
flat
on
all
counts
a
big
miss
for
me
jack
whacker
wheat
ale
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
aroma
tends
to
the
lemon
side
not
much
else
is
noticeable
tastes
fairly
good
the
wheat
is
not
really
noticeable
lemon
is
dominant
but
not
overpowering
a
little
bit
of
hops
toward
the
end
but
not
much
worth
a
try
its
not
bad
d
eh
whatever
the
label
explains
that
a
jack
whackers
role
was
to
whip
the
last
mule
to
keep
the
supply
train
moving
along
in
essence
he
was
an
ass
whipper
jack
whacker
wheat
ale
isnt
quite
an
ass
whipper
of
a
beer
but
it
is
a
very
good
one
considering
the
style
i
could
go
for
a
few
more
of
these
this
summer
a
quality
wheat
brew
from
tommyknocker
poured
a
hazy
dull
gold
a
bit
of
lemon
rind
in
the
aroma
nothing
in
the
malt
profile
really
set
it
out
as
a
wheat
ale
and
there
was
a
significant
grainy
note
that
blossoms
toward
the
end
a
lighter
note
from
the
lemongrass
helps
salvage
the
beer
and
the
finish
is
just
barely
tart
pleasant
enough
but
nothing
noteworthy
12
ounce
bottle
jack
whacker
wheat
pours
out
a
light
golden
brown
color
the
head
is
small
and
fades
away
quickly
weak
malty
flavor
with
a
sour
fruitiness
the
flavor
starts
off
sweet
this
beer
is
brewed
with
lemongrass
the
flavor
is
quite
noticable
it
adds
a
tanginess
to
the
finish
almost
a
minty
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
good
drinkability
i
enjoy
some
of
the
flavors
in
this
beer
but
it
also
has
a
stale
wheat
beer
taste
not
a
great
beer
but
certainly
worth
a
try
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
again
not
too
crazy
about
this
one
but
as
ive
said
before
in
other
reviews
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pale
wheat
ales
this
particular
example
is
a
bit
watery
with
a
bland
finish
sure
it
was
quaffable
enough
but
it
didnt
really
make
me
want
to
have
another
bottle
either
still
it
wasnt
awful
so
if
you
like
the
style
more
than
i
do
give
it
a
try
beer
is
good
happy
different
beering
not
overpowering
by
any
aspect
but
a
solid
little
wheat
to
drink
in
the
summer
heat
or
if
someone
in
the
group
is
ready
for
a
crossover
into
brew
with
more
taste
and
body
in
fact
i
knew
the
wifey
would
like
these
she
did
and
ill
get
some
more
the
next
time
i
spot
these
at
the
store
uniformly
translucent
greenish
gold
appearance
head
is
small
and
turns
into
patches
very
quickly
a
couple
of
globs
for
lace
not
much
of
anything
aroma
is
not
very
satisfying
mostly
lemon
pledge
without
an
accompanying
estery
sense
light
mouthfeel
with
moreorless
medium
carbonation
not
very
fun
to
drink
for
me
the
lemongrass
is
somewhat
like
infused
iced
tea
with
a
brightening
mid
tone
washes
out
a
bit
at
the
end
with
some
off
flavors
that
i
pick
up
as
stale
water
not
much
of
a
wheat
beer
profile
to
help
give
more
interest
to
the
lemony
flavor
whats
here
doesnt
strike
me
as
that
good
though
it
may
appeal
to
some
as
refreshing
during
the
warmer
weather
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
yellow
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
fruity
bananaclove
scent
as
well
as
a
wheat
malt
aroma
its
light
and
yeasty
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
and
slightly
fruity
wheat
flavor
the
yeast
character
isnt
as
pronounced
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
its
pretty
run
of
the
mill
but
it
works
surprised
of
the
low
ratings
from
other
baers
sure
its
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
but
the
intentions
creativity
and
execution
went
quite
well
it
has
an
obvious
american
wheat
base
that
would
have
been
better
with
a
german
hefeweizen
yeast
to
accentuate
the
clove
citrus
and
bananna
characteristics
the
addition
of
lemon
grass
adds
a
nice
citric
earthy
tone
that
dominates
the
otherwise
bland
wheat
character
very
clean
and
refreshing
in
the
finish
with
a
light
mintydryness
a
true
thirstquincher
saw
a
mixed
12pack
and
i
hadnt
really
heard
of
the
brewery
so
i
picked
it
up
12
oz
best
within
4
months
of
feb
05
hmm
anywho
its
my
first
american
wheat
and
after
the
pour
it
sits
in
the
weizen
glass
a
hazy
gold
at
the
bottom
and
an
opaque
peach
at
the
top
with
1
inch
of
white
head
and
fairly
active
carbonation
with
bubbles
that
keep
some
of
the
sediment
near
the
top
of
the
glass
near
the
end
it
is
very
dark
and
looks
like
cider
with
a
bit
of
a
head
it
smells
of
toastygrainy
malts
with
sweet
wheat
some
fruitiness
citrus
and
perhaps
molasses
a
combination
i
havent
met
yet
but
i
like
it
the
flavor
follows
suit
but
with
a
low
bitterness
almost
no
hops
detectable
by
taste
and
a
light
body
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
but
i
imagine
its
a
better
summer
beer
this
is
an
okay
beer
for
a
hot
day
or
with
some
asian
or
hotspicy
food
of
what
ever
ilk
appearance
is
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
quickly
disappeared
aroma
has
wheat
and
citrus
initial
taste
is
coriander
and
lemon
with
notes
of
yeast
and
some
hops
the
citrus
in
the
middle
dissipates
tot
a
dry
finish
might
be
good
with
some
foods
pours
a
cloudy
amberyellow
with
a
small
shortlived
bubbly
head
nose
is
of
citrus
grass
wheat
and
hops
taste
follows
suit
very
lemony
the
front
label
says
its
flavored
with
lemon
grass
with
a
hoppy
finish
very
refreshing
in
the
humid
wisconsin
summer
not
sure
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
them
as
the
lemon
grass
is
rather
overpowering
but
one
or
two
would
be
a
refreshing
start
to
a
session
an
interesting
brew
dark
golden
color
hazy
bodt
with
little
head
smell
is
sweet
like
artificial
banana
flavoring
was
added
taste
is
more
like
a
english
pale
ale
than
a
wheat
beer
murky
underpowered
hops
and
slight
fruity
flavors
are
the
only
things
going
on
in
this
one
as
a
pale
wheat
not
that
good
mouthfeel
is
to
light
over
carbonated
just
to
fizzy
for
my
liking
drinkability
is
well
bad
has
to
be
the
worst
wheat
beer
i
have
had
to
date
thanks
go
to
merlin48
for
the
sample
though
just
cant
win
them
all
this
one
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
so
is
carbonated
water
finally
a
tommyknocker
beer
that
i
like
it
is
a
cloudy
orangish
yellow
color
and
had
a
foamy
white
head
that
disappeared
in
a
hurry
it
smell
of
lemons
and
has
distinct
wheat
malt
notes
if
it
wasnt
for
the
lemon
grass
zing
in
the
aroma
it
would
be
average
but
the
lemony
aroma
is
very
pleasing
the
flavor
is
very
tart
lemon
and
grassy
but
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
actually
benefits
from
the
thin
body
that
all
tommyknocker
beers
seem
to
have
with
so
many
good
summer
beers
available
it
will
be
hard
to
revisit
this
beer
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
very
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
little
skunky
nothing
much
more
than
that
the
flavor
had
a
lemon
and
grass
taste
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
ive
not
been
terribly
impressed
with
the
beers
from
this
company
and
this
falls
into
place
not
much
else
to
say
about
it
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
less
than
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
quickly
the
nose
is
mostly
sweet
wheat
with
a
bit
of
a
citrusy
hop
finish
the
beer
is
light
on
flavor
with
a
sweet
wheat
flavor
being
most
dominant
theres
not
much
hop
coming
through
the
beer
is
rather
light
in
my
mouth
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
would
be
easy
to
sit
down
and
drink
many
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
have
this
beer
again
due
to
the
lack
of
flavor
and
watered
down
taste
i
would
drink
it
again
but
its
definately
not
the
best
wheat
ive
had
added
the
next
day
after
further
review
it
appears
that
skunky
smell
is
from
the
tap
water
i
used
to
rinse
the
soap
residue
off
the
glass
i
guess
i
need
to
install
my
water
filters
semicloudy

the

with

and

notes
in
the
tasting

grass
notes
later
on
with
a
tender

a
quickly
dissolving
aftertaste
yet
a

feel
on

solid
unfiltered
ale
perhaps
a
bit
underrated
on
the
scales
not
as
sour
or
as
sweet
as
some
beers
yet
its
just
a
simple
laid
back
wheat
a
solid
offering
here
i
didnt
enjoy
the
citrus
tones
this
beer
had
to
offer
i
think
without
the
lemon
grass
this
would
have
been
a
good
beer
i
think
ill
skip
this
one
next
time
its
cloudy
yellowgold
body
is
capped
by
a
decentsized
head
of
creamy
brightwhite
foam
that
holds
really
well
and
leaves
some
splashes
of
lace
here
and
there
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
clean
and
delivers
the
expected
delicate
tartness
and
grainy
wheatiness
of
an
american
wheat
beer
along
with
a
soft
bready
sweetness
and
subtle
note
of
lemongrass
the
lemon
grass
becomes
more
apparent
as
it
warms
and
adds
a
unique
and
refreshing
character
the
body
is
distinctly
medium
and
its
nicely
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
due
to
its
very
fine
natural
carbonation
lightly
sweet
and
bready
wheat
malt
dominates
the
palate
with
just
a
subtle
accent
of
fruit
even
banana
and
although
its
sweetish
its
still
fairly
wellbalanced
and
finishes
nicely
dry
with
just
a
mild
lightly
acidic
note
of
cookiedoughlike
malt
the
tartness
suggested
by
the
nose
is
just
barely
present
in
the
flavor
other
than
the
finish
and
the
lemon
grass
doesnt
seem
to
have
left
any
significant
contribution
other
than
to
help
balance
the
doughy
malt
in
the
aftertaste
its
an
interesting
twist
on
an
american
wheat
that
takes
the
ball
but
just
doesnt
run
with
it
pours
a
murky
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
quick
lacing
aroma
is
light
hops
and
spice
light
bodied
with
flavors
of
citrus
floral
hops
and
very
little
wheat
finish
is
rather
crisp
and
carbonated
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
overall
but
not
bad
on
the
scale
of
other
american
wheats
i
have
tried
this
brew
pours
a
large
head
of
fine
and
medium
sized
white
bubbles
with
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
body
it
has
a
mild
breadfruit
aroma
with
a
slight
initial
tingle
then
its
fruit
flavor
and
the
lemon
come
on
acceptable
but
somehow
i
just
dont
care
that
much
for
the
lemon
flavoring
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
brew
had
a
large
white
frothy
head
with
mostly
fine
bubbles
the
body
was
cloudy
and
the
hue
was
straw
it
had
a
lemon
aroma
to
it
and
a
taste
of
lemon
along
with
an
acidic
taste
this
brew
had
good
lacing
it
tasted
thin
and
a
bit
watery
this
brew
lacked
character
as
nothing
really
special
stood
out
with
this
particular
american
wheat
it
was
on
the
flat
side
in
my
opinion
farily
light
goden
color
hazy
beer
topped
by
a
moderate
but
loosely
formed
white
head
the
head
fades
rather
quickly
a
hint
of
yeast
on
the
aroma
gives
way
quickly
to
a
wheat
crispness
and
some
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
rather
light
exhibiting
little
yeast
qualities
there
is
a
substantial
crispness
to
the
beer
as
well
as
a
decent
citrus
note
presumably
from
the
hops
the
body
is
very
thin
almost
watery
drinkability
is
poor
as
the
watery
body
and
the
citrus
notes
remind
me
more
of
lemonade
than
a
wheat
beer
wheat
ale
this
is
about
as
enjoyable
as
a
kick
in
the
groin
after
the
erdinger
i
had
earlier
color
is
a
cloudy
medium
gold
i
poured
the
sediment
in
after
all
it
is
a
wheat
beer
it
poured
with
a
medium
head
that
disappeared
rather
quickly
nice
lace
though
aroma
is
very
subtle
by
the
third
sniff
i
couldnt
even
smell
it
any
more
flavor
is
nothing
special
kind
of
lemony
bitter
with
a
touch
of
malt
and
hops
if
this
beer
was
clear
it
would
almost
be
a
macro
almost
but
not
quite
that
bland
wheats
were
never
my
favorite
and
this
one
is
no
exception
its
not
a
bad
brew
its
just
not
my
style
turbid
pale
golden
in
color
topped
by
a
thin
spotty
white
head
that
leaves
isolated
aggregates
of
foam
tart
lemon
grass
and
doughy
maltose
like
sweetness
upfront
in
aroma
ensued
by
understated
banana
esters
and
token
grainy
wheat
sticky
sucrose
sweetness
hits
the
palate
at
first
then
is
ceded
by
a
brief
snap
of
hop
bitterness
then
mild
notes
of
stale
cracker
and
cracked
wheat
suggestions
of
cold
chunky
cream
of
wheat
drizzled
with
lemon
and
confectioners
sugar
decently
proteinaceous
mouthfeel
finishes
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
soured
cream
an
odd
off
balanced
brew
that
approaches
cloying
in
its
sweetness
not
an
improvement
on
the
typical
insipid
american
wheat
at
least
theyre
clean
the
beer
pours
a
lightly
chill
hazed
golden
orange
color
with
the
head
adequate
in
size
and
the
texture
frothy
with
lots
of
fine
lace
to
conceal
the
glass
the
aroma
of
yeast
the
typical
bread
dough
description
fits
nicely
citrus
crisp
and
fresh
start
is
sweet
with
the
top
middling
in
feel
the
finish
sparsely
hopped
moderately
carbonated
and
the
aftertaste
typically
dry
drinkable
beer
but
overall
quite
plain
and
nothing
separates
it
from
a
million
other
beers
so
the
average
rating
applies
per
my
rating
criteria
the
beer
looks
fairly
viscous
as
it
glugs
into
my
glass
very
murky
golden
with
shades
of
orange
no
head
just
a
rimming
fairly
light
odor
for
a
weizen
but
there
are
some
nice
subtle
notes
of
lemon
pepper
and
citrus
body
of
this
beer
is
between
medium
and
mediumfull
the
taste
begs
for
your
attention
i
understand
why
this
is
in
the
herb
and
spice
category
now
this
doesnt
taste
like
your
typical
hefe
weizen
the
lemon
grass
adds
a
nice
touch
though
a
thirst
quenching
taste
that
makes
you
want
to
keep
drinking
more
and
fast
pretty
decent
beer
here
jack
wacker
cool
name
even
more
interesting
beer
lemon
grass
eh
now
thats
unique
you
can
definitely
taste
it
the
nose
is
pretty
mellow
but
there
are
hints
of
citrus
evident
i
dont
get
the
typical
wheat
flavor
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
very
little
carbonation
solid
and
unique
a
good
combo
in
my
book
this
unfiltered
wheat
ale
pours
with
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
and
a
thin
yet
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
nicely
balanced
between
malt
and
the
addition
of
lemon
grass
which
imparts
surprise
a
slightly
lemony
character
to
the
perfume
the
flavor
is
very
close
to
that
of
a
true
german
hefeweizen
with
an
addition
of
a
lemon
tartness
that
grows
from
the
sip
to
the
finish
very
interesting
and
tasty
brew
notes
very
drinkable
and
makes
for
a
great
hot
weather
brew
nice
addition
of
lemon
grass
in
the
brew
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
lemony
grassy
iced
tea
comes
to
mind
while
sipping
this
brew
very
tasty
and
i
imagine
myself
pounding
down
a
sixer
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
sweet
and
summery
drank
out
of
the
can
so
not
sure
about
the
look
my
parents
brought
these
back
from
hawaii
with
them
for
me
solid
beer
have
to
visit
the
brewery
someday
clean
with
a
body
similar
to
a
hefe
tastes
are
dominantly
wheat
with
pineapple
juice
wish
i
would
have
picked
up
a
full
pack
of
this
an
interesting
take
on
this
style
and
one
that
makes
me
more
curious
about
this
brewery
m
medium
carbonation
and
quite
full
bodied
finishes
medium
sweet
some
more
beery
edge
underlying
could
really
make
this
pop
pleasant
summery
mauiesque
drop
but
feel
it
could
really
be
an
intriguing
beer
if
consumed
fresh
as
its
well
crafted
o
a
refreshing
summer
beer
nothing
too
serious
a
fun
beer
i
like
the
pineapple
here
o
i
am
normally
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
i
think
the
hint
of
pineapple
makes
the
difference
o
a
very
good
fruity
wheat
ale
definitely
recommended
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
wheat
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
lemon
and
hint
of
hop
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hint
of
lemon
hint
of
clove
wheat
slight
pale
malt
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
good
appearance
feel
body
and
blend
not
a
real
complex
beer
but
rather
a
summer
patio
quencher
that
makes
good
use
of
the
wheat
notes
and
the
added
pineapple
flavour
not
too
sweet
and
quite
nice
on
the
finish
this
is
easy
drinking
and
decent
for
the
style
compares
with
konas
wheat
beer
though
they
use
passionfruit
as
an
addition
tastes
better
on
a
maui
beach
o
had
quite
high
hopes
for
this
beer
which
partly
explains
my
slightly
scathing
review
the
lack
of
pineapple
on
the
palate
was
a
missed
opportunity
and
overall
this
beer
did
very
little
for
me
i
think
the
explanation
for
this
lies
in
my
expectation
of
a
beer
which
would
have
fruity
and
wheaty
characteristics
if
you
go
into
it
expecting
a
slightly
wheaty
lager
with
pineapple
in
the
nose
you
might
not
be
as
disappointed
forgettable
yet
drinkable
as
expected
this
is
a
fairly
simplistic
wheat
beer
that
has
been
infused
with
pineapple
easy
drinking
not
bad
and
it
can
hit
the
spot
when
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summers
day
the
pineapple
definitely
contributes
quite
a
bit
more
to
the
nose
than
it
does
the
flavor
this
one
makes
it
seem
like
pineapple
is
a
natural
for
brewing
with
fortunately
the
flavor
is
on
the
subtle
side
this
could
put
the
blonde
ales
out
of
business
it
actually
tastes
better
as
it
warms
up
a
little
a
beery
light
beer
with
a
touch
of
flavor
if
thats
what
youre
hoping
for
from
the
12
oz
can
bought
at
beercraft
in
san
diego
as
it
warms
up
the
pineapple
flavor
and
the
aroma
open
up
more
and
more
great
beer
that
incorporates
some
local
fruit
doesnt
mask
the
original
style
creates
something
different
and
good
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
fruit
beers
that
are
not
too
sweet
o
refreshing
creamy
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
an
enjoyable
beer
for
hot
weather
overall
a
pretty
simple
tasting
beer
but
refreshing
and
tasty
would
love
to
have
access
to
dozens
of
cheap
cans
of
this
stuff
7
010
o
refreshing
light
beer
worthy
of
a
try
as
expected
this
one
is
pretty
tropical
and
fruit
with
a
good
refreshing
taste
to
it
and
one
that
made
for
easy
drinking
a
great
tasting
beer
that
mixes
a
traditional
hefeweizen
with
tonnes
of
tropical
flavours
and
somehow
it
works
overall
pretty
average
apwa
simple
two
note
flavor
fizzy
fairly
hefty
price
tag
not
a
good
combination
good
summer
brew
but
there
are
considerably
better
options
at
half
the
cost
needless
to
say
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
a
cloudy
honey
colored
pour
with
a
finger
of
head
which
quickly
diminished
scents
of
lemongrass
sour
notes
bready
a
slightly
tart
sweet
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
citrus
sweeter
than
most
wheat
beers
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
and
is
surprisingly
refreshing
a
nice
surprise
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
one
but
it
was
really
nice
and
sweet
for
the
style
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
youll
forget
about
it
rather
quickly
its
just
too
light
in
terms
of
flavor
and
body
to
leave
any
sort
of
impression
there
are
a
number
of
other
wheat
beers
id
rather
drink
than
this
one
a
very
light
tasting
beer
not
much
to
write
home
about
unless
you
need
a
lighter
beer
to
cool
off
with
after
running
a
marathon
or
something
overall
a
nice
simple
wheat
with
a
pretty
good
balance
carbonation
is
much
too
high
and
the
body
feels
a
bit
watery
a
lot
of
wheats
can
be
boring
this
one
offers
a
unique
flavor
and
wasnt
bad
at
all
considering
how
old
it
is
overall
a
nice
wheat
beer
would
be
good
for
the
summer
around
the
pool
not
stellar
pours
gold
with
a
hint
of
amber
head
disappears
by
the
end
of
the
beer
with
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
cloudy
aroma
and
the
description
on
the
can
set
expectations
high
wheat
smell
with
citrus
and
definite
sweeter
fruit
from
the
pineapple
taste
decent
for
a
wheat
but
the
pineapple
is
subtle
and
does
little
to
enhance
the
citrus
flavors
i
respect
the
subtle
fruit
but
at
the
same
time
left
me
wishing
for
more
as
for
the
beer
eh
so
so
i
never
seem
to
enjoy
trying
many
wheat
beers
it
seems
this
one
is
hearty
but
kind
of
oddly
earthy
in
a
way
there
seems
to
be
some
vegetal
thing
in
on
the
mix
here
which
is
somewhat
different
and
this
touch
of
odd
smoky
kind
of
thing
i
dont
know
what
thats
about
but
i
want
to
say
it
has
something
to
do
with
pineapple
overall
it
is
pretty
drinkable
but
there
is
something
about
it
that
seems
muted
i
think
the
pineapple
are
offering
some
unusual
character
to
this
one
the
body
was
nice
crisp
smooth
and
dry
drinkability
was
very
good
knocking
off
a
sixer
while
enjoying
the
nice
summer
weather
would
be
too
easy
overall
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
a
very
enjoyable
beer
thats
worth
your
time
if
you
see
it
i
really
like
maui
gold
pineapples
every
time
i
visit
hawaii
or
california
i
bring
back
around
4
of
them
anybody
thats
had
them
before
you
know
why
when
i
found
out
that
mbc
made
a
wheat
ale
with
maui
gold
i
had
to
jump
on
it
i
thought
this
one
had
a
great
balance
between
the
maui
gold
and
the
wheat
maui
gold
is
very
sweet
and
has
very
low
acidity
to
it
so
i
figured
it
would
be
a
bit
over
powering
but
they
did
a
good
job
not
letting
that
happen
its
a
great
beer
for
the
hot
weather
down
here
i
just
wish
i
didnt
have
to
bring
it
from
cali
or
hawaii
when
i
visit
roundly
sweet
with
a
strong
flavor
of
toasted
banana
bread
a
sailor
jerryish
spiced
rum
note
and
a
twang
of
pineapple
its
weird
but
i
like
it
the
base
is
a
classic
hefeweizen
and
really
thats
what
this
is
you
could
be
fooled
into
thinking
into
its
just
an
unusually
fruity
specimen
from
bavaria
its
a
little
bit
slick
with
sugar
and
gluten
but
overall
quite
refreshing
and
unlike
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
its
not
overly
gassy
it
doesnt
rank
among
the
worlds
best
weissbiers
but
it
is
novel
and
tasty
if
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
in
one
night
still
it
makes
for
a
lovely
treat
on
occasion
o
overall
this
is
another
excellent
wheat
beer
in
a
can
for
a
hot
summer
day
a
pretty
darned
drinkable
example
of
the
style
twisted
and
a
tad
mutated
for
the
remote
island
ethos
for
the
better
i
must
declare
this
little
fruit
experiment
is
cute
as
it
just
adds
to
an
already
capable
underlying
wheat
ale
d
for
a
brew
that
probably
should
have
been
taken
off
the
shelf
this
is
pretty
tasty
definitely
worth
picking
up
if
you
dig
the
wheat
brews
golden
hazy
wheat
look
decent
1
finger
head
with
minimal
lacing
and
retention
smell
is
that
of
most
wheats
with
a
bit
more
fruit
on
this
one
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
very
fruity
taste
and
this
i
attribute
to
the
strong
pineapple
forward
character
nothing
complex
but
fairly
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
more
like
a
juice
than
a
beer
i
feel
that
they
went
a
little
overboard
on
the
fruit
character
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
a
simple
wheat
that
is
a
bit
of
a
one
trick
pony
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
a
unique
twist
on
a
style
that
was
a
bit
too
fruity
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
probably
very
good
to
enjoy
at
the
beach
o
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
remember
when
we
were
in
maui
last
year
my
wife
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
and
she
really
enjoyed
it
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
time
around
too
certainly
a
beer
wed
buy
again
o
this
beer
is
awesome
the
pineapple
really
works
well
with
the
wheat
ale
simple
concept
executed
very
well
m
medium
bodied
o
i
think
i
had
tons
more
affection
for
this
brew
than
just
about
everyone
else
who
has
reviewed
it
so
far
and
thats
totally
cool
i
dug
the
fresh
fruit
and
the
light
body
i
could
pop
a
few
of
these
around
the
pool
in
the
summertime
ultimately
i
cant
say
a
lot
of
nice
things
about
this
beer
its
a
subpar
wheat
ale
with
an
excessive
amount
of
driedout
sticky
pineapples
thrown
in
the
mix
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
im
not
even
sure
if
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
its
a
nice
take
on
the
wheat
beer
but
the
pineapple
dominates
in
the
long
run
and
loses
some
of
the
more
subtle
flavor
profiles
pours
an
almost
opaque
cloudy
goldorange
with
a
huge
offwhite
head
head
has
many
different
size
bubbles
from
mousse
to
rocky
aroma
is
wheaties
in
unsweetened
pineapple
juice
plus
some
sharp
clove
from
the
yeast
taste
is
flat
a
little
cardboardy
but
goes
down
easy
the
little
bit
of
pineapple
in
the
taste
needs
some
sweetness
or
maybe
just
more
of
the
flavor
or
added
carbonation
from
the
appearance
i
expected
this
to
be
more
like
a
hefeweizen
but
there
is
none
of
the
zip
of
a
good
hefe
this
might
be
a
decent
beach
beer
especially
considering
the
can
or
might
be
paired
with
a
pineapple
burger
to
effect
not
my
thing
but
not
bad
theres
a
time
and
a
place
for
a
beer
like
this
id
have
another
while
grilling
out
or
toobing
down
the
river
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
wheat
spices
yeast
and
some
pineapple
notes
taste
is
of
wheat
spices
and
a
pretty
good
pineapple
flavor
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
wheat
beer
but
the
pineapple
comes
across
better
in
the
flavor
over
the
smell
overall
i
was
hoping
this
would
have
a
little
more
ripe
pineapple
taste
its
more
of
a
unripened
pineapple
flavour
going
on
its
a
good
beer
that
im
happy
i
chance
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
i
enjoyed
this
the
pineapple
character
came
off
as
more
authentic
than
artificial
to
me
and
i
thought
that
it
nicely
complimented
the
wheat
flavors
in
this
this
was
crisp
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
id
be
down
with
checking
out
more
of
this
in
the
future
its
cool
to
see
maui
down
in
maryland
now
o
one
of
my
goto
beers
far
from
your
average
wheat
beer
d
very
drinkable
a
bit
too
much
fruit
juice
without
enough
of
wheat
beer
it
is
also
a
bit
too
thin
and
watery
o
i
really
like
this
beer
i
do
think
that
its
better
on
tap
as
far
as
smell
goes
but
its
fine
canned
this
is
one
of
the
best
uses
of
fruit
ive
ever
encountered
especially
for
a
fruit
that
can
be
as
cloying
as
pineapple
i
was
impressed
that
they
managed
to
make
something
that
smelled
like
syrupy
pineapple
juice
taste
so
refreshing
and
clean
i
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
especially
as
cans
can
be
brought
to
the
park
o
a
complex
beer
for
a
wheat
and
not
sweet
at
all
really
delish
and
nice
mo
the
beer
has
a
nice
carbonation
and
is
very
refreshing
not
too
strong
but
very
balanced
considering
that
some
of
these
beers
with
fruit
can
overdo
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
some
brackish
aftertaste
wont
be
back
to
this
one
i
love
this
beer
nothing
to
hype
over
but
definitely
super
delicious
imo
i
didnt
much
enjoy
the
few
pineapple
beers
i
had
had
to
this
point
but
i
sure
did
enjoy
mana
wheat
its
as
refreshing
as
a
premoistened
toilette
and
is
a
solid
example
of
a
style
that
is
so
often
predictable
and
underwhelming
while
a
bit
middling
it
benefits
from
the
same
highquality
craftsmanship
that
characterizes
all
maui
brewing
beers
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
although
more
clear
than
most
wheats
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
sweet
pineapple
tropical
fruit
feel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
taste
is
good
enough
very
light
there
is
some
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
pineapple
taste
and
a
little
sweet
malts
overall
a
pretty
light
beer
the
pineapples
applied
with
a
deft
touch
are
refreshing
and
subtly
sweet
overall
its
not
bad
a
decent
beer
for
the
pool
or
golf
course
mouthfeel
feels
like
juice
when
youre
drinking
it
i
wish
the
carbonation
stayed
with
the
beer
longer
could
use
more
bite
but
would
make
a
great
summer
time
pool
beer
overall
nice
and
refreshing
i
enjoyed
the
use
of
pineapple
i
wouldnt
call
it
great
but
i
would
have
another
mo
i
know
this
is
considered
an
american
wheat
ale
and
as
a
hefe
lover
i
consider
them
when
tasting
the
american
versions
as
well
saying
that
this
one
is
just
average
i
do
appreciate
the
use
of
the
local
fruits
for
an
ale
brewed
with
pineapple
juice
its
not
overly
sweet
or
too
much
pineapple
flavor
its
very
subtle
if
noticeable
at
all
its
a
bit
too
thick
to
be
refreshing
and
the
wheat
eventually
envelops
the
taste
completely
overall
i
dont
feel
like
i
need
to
seek
this
beer
out
again
i
admire
the
ambition
of
the
brewer
pineapple
wheat
ale
seriously
but
to
me
this
is
more
of
a
novelty
beverage
pours
an
almost
murky
orange
yellow
color
decent
white
head
with
pretty
good
retention
strong
banana
aroma
with
some
spiciness
and
a
bit
of
citrus
aroma
banana
aroma
reminds
me
of
dried
banana
chips
the
pineapple
flavor
is
relegated
to
the
background
this
is
not
an
over
the
top
fruity
beer
which
i
appreciate
but
actually
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
of
the
pineapple
in
this
one
the
banana
flavor
actually
takes
first
billing
which
is
a
bit
surprising
hmmm
there
just
isnt
much
going
on
in
this
beer
and
the
upfront
smell
and
flavor
is
not
pleasant
overall
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
one
i
have
a
weird
obsession
with
all
things
pineapple
it
just
didnt
follow
threw
with
as
much
pineapple
as
i
would
like
to
see
it
really
is
a
good
brew
with
great
drinkability
on
a
hot
day
it
just
underwelmed
me
as
just
another
good
wheat
o
a
decent
brew
especially
for
summer
went
down
too
easy
tastes
just
like
it
smells
however
i
like
it
its
a
slightly
phony
tasting
hybrid
wheat
beer
that
just
hit
the
spot
at
the
time
i
slammed
it
and
i
enjoyed
it
i
plan
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
sixer
by
the
pool
during
a
4th
of
july
party
and
cant
think
of
much
else
that
would
suffice
i
wonder
how
different
it
would
be
on
draught
at
the
brewpub
with
a
plate
of
beerfried
brie
in
front
of
me
overall
this
beer
needs
to
be
taken
back
to
the
drawing
board
a
good
idea
that
just
doesnt
pan
out
fruit
beer
category
each
sip
is
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
with
a
husky
mineral
note
in
the
finish
the
wheat
is
mellow
which
allows
the
sweet
tart
acidity
of
the
pineapple
to
flash
across
the
palate
midsip
mouthfeel
is
superb
creamysmooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
thin
body
is
amazingly
drinkable
on
a
hot
texas
day
without
feeling
overly
watery
overall
a
tasty
wheat
from
maui
brewing
company
definitely
glad
i
have
another
five
cans
poured
into
a
pint
glass
slightly
washed
to
prevent
head
formation
but
this
beer
had
so
much
malt
and
yeast
i
epically
failed
with
the
immediate
crack
of
the
can
you
get
a
wiff
of
pineapple
very
nice
the
smell
up
close
is
pineapple
and
a
hint
of
grain
really
good
smell
i
really
like
pineapple
so
i
was
excited
for
the
taste
the
taste
is
pineapple
and
more
pineapple
with
a
finish
of
a
high
end
wheat
beer
i
was
really
surprised
with
this
beer
i
was
thinking
of
a
wheat
beer
with
a
hint
of
pineapple
but
this
was
the
opposite
for
2
bucks
this
was
an
amazing
experience
the
mouthfeel
was
not
bad
it
was
not
too
dry
and
the
flavor
was
not
stuck
in
my
mouth
for
that
long
overall
i
gave
this
a
good
rating
due
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
random
find
and
have
had
no
hype
provided
to
me
from
friends
i
would
buy
one
can
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
very
and
i
mean
very
sweet
beer
overall
not
for
me
but
if
you
love
fruit
in
your
beer
than
this
is
definately
for
you
o
this
would
be
an
okay
beer
for
sitting
poolside
but
it
just
wasnt
really
my
thing
id
like
it
better
if
the
pineapple
was
integrated
a
bit
better
and
not
just
taste
like
a
can
of
juice
was
poured
in
not
too
bad
not
too
great
average
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
might
find
a
home
with
the
masses
but
its
too
sweet
for
me
and
too
one
dimensional
accent
great
lead
not
so
much
avail
here
in
tx
glad
to
try
it
as
ive
heard
good
things
about
maui
but
one
is
enough
for
me
no
o
overall
pretty
meh
the
artificial
tasting
pineapple
juice
gets
old
quick
and
is
pretty
distracting
id
be
really
unhappy
if
i
had
another
5
of
these
to
finish
i
think
this
might
be
really
good
in
a
smoothie
if
youre
into
drinking
smoothies
many
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
for
me
to
try
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
lots
of
head
rushing
to
the
top
of
my
glass
smell
is
of
pineapple
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
taste
is
not
sweet
pineapples
are
present
as
are
some
wheat
and
grains
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
worth
seeking
out
this
is
the
4th
beer
i
have
tried
from
maui
brewing
and
all
have
been
of
superior
quality
we
need
to
get
them
distributed
here
in
pa
i
dont
know
what
everyone
else
was
drinking
but
this
beer
tastes
like
vomit
and
smells
like
it
too
the
malt
and
hop
aroma
that
may
be
there
are
masked
by
a
pungent
aroma
of
puked
pineapple
the
head
was
great
and
the
beer
looked
stellar
but
every
time
i
brought
the
beer
close
to
my
face
i
triggered
my
gag
reflex
this
beer
could
possibly
drive
me
back
to
watered
down
lager
style
beers
they
never
let
you
down
like
this
do
this
filtered
wheat
beer
is
fairly
accomplished
refreshing
the
palate
while
generating
interest
it
is
quite
dissimilar
to
most
other
wheat
beers
in
appearance
as
well
as
other
qualities
it
presents
itself
more
like
an
adventurous
blond
ale
than
anything
traditionally
associated
with
wheat
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
out
on
the
bbq
the
crack
glug
netted
two
rocky
fingers
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
nose
was
redolent
with
pineapple
woody
typed
dolefully
a
tom
swifty
pun
in
case
you
may
have
glossed
over
it
i
postulated
recently
that
a
cherry
beer
with
easter
ham
would
be
good
but
this
would
go
equally
well
or
with
a
hawaiian
pizza
i
am
all
of
a
sudden
hungry
as
hell
it
may
have
something
to
do
with
that
bowl
of
maui
pineapple
gold
earlier
mouthfeel
had
a
real
twang
to
it
like
having
the
dentist
grab
your
tongue
with
pliers
and
hit
it
with
a
hammer
eyeopening
it
was
both
sweet
and
spicy
at
once
and
if
i
ever
see
somebody
adding
fruit
to
this
i
will
take
their
beer
from
them
this
was
smooth
as
heck
and
the
lacing
was
pretty
as
the
beer
simply
seemed
to
evaporate
from
my
glass
i
got
a
taste
like
pineapple
and
black
pepper
on
the
tongue
to
be
a
bit
more
specific
btw
the
finish
however
was
all
pineapple
sorry
leinies
sunset
wheat
but
you
just
got
ejected
from
the
cooler
this
would
be
phenomenal
at
any
time
including
01
febrewary
hula
in
the
coola
day
but
especially
at
the
beach
the
honeyhoneys
doing
the
grass
skirt
number
me
opening
cans
as
quickly
as
possible
surfers
hitting
the
tasty
waves
bro
its
on
interesting
concept
to
make
a
exotic
wheat
wit
hybrid
with
tropical
flare
i
think
they
went
a
bit
too
overboard
with
the
spice
and
yeast
and
much
of
the
fruit
flavor
was
lost
resulting
in
a
really
soapy
finish
was
expecting
more
from
this
the
cpj
overall
a
drinkable
wheat
beer
that
has
a
couple
flaws
case
in
point
a
seeming
lack
of
integration
between
the
flavors
and
an
awkward
finish
imagine
drinking
a
sweet
tasty
wheat
beer
that
finishes
like
a
pilsner
urquell
some
people
may
like
that
i
dont
however
its
decent
enough
to
warrant
another
try
if
not
at
least
to
appreciate
what
the
brewery
is
trying
to
do
here
namely
produce
a
tropically
exotic
pale
wheat
ale
final
thought
for
11
99
this
is
not
worth
a
six
if
you
can
find
this
in
a
single
can
give
it
a
try
o
well
interesting
take
on
the
awpa
but
not
really
up
my
alley
the
yeast
overwhelms
the
novelty
ingredient
of
the
beer
likely
would
have
been
better
off
in
a
lower
wheat
proportionate
grain
bill
lower
srm
and
body
when
i
opened
and
poured
this
i
wanted
to
dislike
it
but
the
first
sip
was
like
a
slap
on
the
face
and
a
firm
demand
to
pull
oneself
together
as
i
say
probably
not
a
session
beer
but
if
you
like
wheat
beers
or
anything
with
a
bit
of
tartness
to
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
give
this
a
try
overall
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
much
more
interesting
than
it
turned
out
to
be
should
be
popular
with
the
masses
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
dated
90310
into
my
singha
little
beer
glass
lightly
hazy
light
amberorange
colored
body
and
about
a
finger
of
big
bubbled
fizzy
head
head
holds
for
about
2
minutes
or
so
lacing
slips
from
the
glass
as
you
drink
no
sticking
smells
of
american
wheat
beer
kinda
corn
tortillaish
canned
pineapple
along
with
the
metallic
can
lining
a
little
flowery
sweetness
very
pleasant
nose
medium
light
body
on
the
tongue
the
pineapple
definitely
comes
through
some
of
that
wheaty
goodness
light
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
is
dry
despite
the
slightly
sweet
nose
prickly
nice
carbonation
great
hot
weather
beer
love
great
beer
wasnt
really
a
fan
of
this
brew
i
thought
the
wheatmalt
aspects
werent
quite
bold
enough
and
as
a
consequence
the
pineapple
just
tasted
watereddown
as
opposed
to
providing
flavor
enhancement
overall
had
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
bbq
day
and
i
remember
liking
it
much
better
than
when
i
sat
down
for
this
after
dinner
beer
review
i
like
the
unusual
take
on
this
wheat
ale
and
will
drink
this
again
but
not
as
great
as
i
once
thought
it
was
might
have
overrated
it
while
i
was
in
the
moment
interesting
beer
just
not
for
me
drink
a
small
tasty
little
beer
in
a
can
good
with
clean
flavors
and
quite
refreshing
d
i
liked
this
and
this
is
the
first
wheat
beer
i
have
drank
in
a
while
that
i
would
honestly
say
i
would
buy
again
it
also
looks
like
i
was
lucky
to
find
this
in
winter
at
bevmo
in
huntington
beach
i
wish
i
could
find
another
6
pack
and
save
for
the
summer
good
job
maui
brewing
co
hats
off
bottom
line
i
could
drink
this
refreshing
brew
as
a
castaway
but
as
i
write
this
review
im
reminded
that
the
price
at
least
for
a
coloradon
could
really
only
be
afforded
by
thurston
howell
iii
however
i
would
gladly
pay
it
drinkability
very
refreshing
especially
in
maui
but
this
really
did
not
seem
all
that
different
from
other
american
wheats
some
reviews
mention
too
much
pineapple
others
like
mine
mention
just
the
barest
touch
consistency
issues
regardless
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
and
refreshing
d
you
can
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
overall
just
a
weird
beer
ill
try
it
again
on
draft
and
see
if
i
feel
the
same
way
who
put
pineapple
in
my
hefe
ok
so
i
clearly
knew
there
was
gonna
be
pineapple
in
this
and
thats
why
i
wanted
to
try
it
the
pineapple
however
completely
overshadows
everything
else
in
this
beer
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
wheat
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
clouded
orange
golden
body
with
a
nice
large
bubbled
white
head
fine
lacing
spread
across
the
glass
aroma
has
a
nice
citrus
flow
to
it
with
hints
of
tart
pineapple
around
the
edges
this
is
a
pretty
cool
concept
nice
base
wheat
beer
with
maui
gold
pineapples
flavors
bring
a
nice
fruity
roll
between
tropical
fruitcitrus
blend
with
wheat
beer
base
coming
through
phenolic
mildly
spiced
character
works
well
together
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
even
soft
carbonation
nothing
off
here
drinkability
overall
its
nice
to
have
some
pineapple
burps
rather
than
the
typical
hop
burp
nice
experience
works
well
overall
very
drinkable
interesting
due
to
abv
and
refreshing
taste
you
can
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
an
interesting
beer
but
the
advertised
component
blew
away
most
of
the
other
attributes
which
could
have
made
this
better
poured
a
dark
yellow
into
steinlager
glass
the
smell
of
pineapples
are
definitely
there
taste
of
a
wheat
ale
with
pineapples
good
mouthfeel
it
has
a
refreshing
taste
to
it
good
drinkability
pineapple
juice
with
a
bite
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
interesting
in
addition
to
wheat
i
get
a
lot
of
smoke
very
odd
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
smoke
wheat
and
some
citrus
fruit
possibly
pineapple
or
mangoes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
wheat
beer
with
pineapple
perfect
after
a
long
day
of
surfing
very
nice
wheat
ale
with
some
interesting
flavors
nice
fruitiness
but
the
medicinal
flavor
is
a
bit
offputting
at
first
once
it
dies
down
a
bit
this
is
good
stuff
overall
very
nice
light
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
no
overwheliming
flavors
a
nice
wheat
ale
from
the
isles
i
wish
i
were
there
drinking
this
d
i
was
disappointed
by
this
one
perhaps
its
a
beer
that
fairs
better
being
freshly
kegged
because
it
was
nothing
like
what
i
remember
having
beer
is
light
in
body
and
has
a
clean
finish
its
ok
no
real
pineapple
flavor
kind
of
thin
and
flat
its
not
a
great
wheat
beer
just
another
novelty
md
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
but
not
watery
an
improvement
over
most
of
this
style
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
easily
see
a
sixer
being
killed
by
accident
just
going
one
after
the
other
an
approachable
summer
beer
good
for
a
picnic
or
pool
party
but
not
too
impressive
on
its
own
appearance
is
a
nice
cloudy
orange
clearly
unfiltered
just
the
way
i
like
it
smells
of
wheat
and
pineapple
strong
on
both
and
nothing
else
distinctive
taste
is
the
same
as
smell
a
nice
unfiltered
wheat
taste
with
moderate
to
strong
carbonation
and
a
nice
pineapple
flavor
very
drinkable
and
very
impressed
i
would
definitely
order
this
beer
again
stopped
by
at
one
of
my
favorite
beer
stores
and
discovered
they
had
the
new
mana
wheat
in
by
maui
brewing
picked
up
a
sixer
and
went
to
a
friends
house
to
share
it
with
her
it
pours
a
really
golden
color
mixed
with
a
little
orange
in
it
the
beer
is
hazy
but
not
to
dense
the
smell
was
what
you
would
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
with
the
little
exception
of
pineapples
yep
pineapples
the
taste
was
yeasty
but
the
acidity
of
the
pineapples
really
balanced
out
the
flavor
quite
well
it
was
going
down
nice
and
smooth
on
a
hot
hawaiian
day
d
certainly
not
difficult
to
drink
but
the
smoke
on
the
nose
is
a
negative
and
its
not
really
good
enough
to
want
more
than
one
this
is
one
i
would
pass
on
really
not
even
worth
the
taste
from
my
point
of
view
d
a
solid
wheat
beer
i
liked
how
the
hefe
and
pineapple
came
together
but
not
a
beer
id
rush
out
and
by
again
would
i
buy
more
of
it
if
only
i
could
id
be
stocking
up
on
this
and
the
other
maui
cans
on
a
regular
basis
a
nice
crisp
wheat
beer
i
love
the
subtle
citrus
taste
overall
well
done
youve
got
to
give
some
props
to
a
committed
focus
on
kansas
wheat
probably
would
seem
even
better
if
it
was
a
summer
day
instead
of
midoctober
this
is
a
very
good
wheat
beer
o
nice
summer
wheat
beer
very
drinkable
but
with
more
kick
than
most
wheats
not
something
i
would
crave
all
the
time
but
can
see
myself
picking
it
up
from
time
to
time
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
nice
carbonated
head
hay
wheat
and
grain
predominate
the
nose
theres
nothing
subtle
about
the
taste
of
wheat
on
the
tongue
very
bready
also
with
a
bit
of
lemony
citrus
medium
mouth
that
seems
to
me
a
bit
chewy
but
that
may
be
from
all
the
wheat
this
beer
implants
upon
the
brain
this
is
an
unexpectedly
nice
beer
i
like
it
would
have
again
overall
a
very
good
wheat
ale
with
nice
flavors
balance
and
not
overly
sweet
i
think
this
works
best
as
a
beer
paired
with
food
especially
bbq
rather
than
a
everyday
session
beer
not
that
its
even
meant
to
be
that
overall
another
solid
beer
from
tallgrass
but
theres
plenty
of
superior
wheats
out
there
competing
for
my
money
82100
moderately
golden
hued
with
plenty
of
haziness
brussels
lacing
a
fingernail
of
off
white
head
sits
on
top
aroma
of
pale
wheat
with
just
a
trace
of
banana
the
pale
wheat
flavor
is
a
bit
of
a
sourdough
bread
note
the
mouth
is
very
light
and
this
is
highly
quaffable
overall
i
imagine
this
is
a
crowd
pleaser
particularly
for
those
who
like
a
sweeter
style
a
wheat
beer
with
a
difference
but
i
prefer
mine
hoppy
ontap
at
bernies
taproom
in
waukesha
wi
this
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
color
with
a
slight
head
the
taste
is
smooth
full
of
wheat
and
a
hint
of
citrus
overall
pretty
good
and
delicious
for
being
a
lesser
known
wheat
beer
this
is
pretty
good
overall
a
solid
wheat
ale
hoppier
than
usual
for
the
style
but
it
lends
a
nice
balance
final
thoughts
while
nothing
about
halcyon
unfiltered
wheat
really
wows
the
palate
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
enjoyed
in
this
beer
the
refreshing
and
drinkable
mix
of
flavors
make
it
a
perfect
summer
beer
and
one
of
the
best
wheat
ales
ive
ever
had
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
overall
a
noticeable
fruity
presence
with
nice
sweetness
not
my
favorite
wheat
beer
but
good
for
a
summer
evening
the
flavor
displays
the
hops
more
fully
than
the
aroma
suggests
and
theres
some
pine
in
there
along
with
the
citrusy
notes
the
wheat
flavor
remains
solid
and
the
yeast
adds
a
light
touch
of
chalkiness
and
seemingly
some
light
spiciness
in
that
sense
its
more
like
a
belgian
witbier
than
a
bavarian
hefeweizen
im
quite
sure
theyre
using
a
belgian
strain
and
in
fact
have
intended
a
belgianstyle
wit
with
a
bit
of
citrusy
american
hops
thrown
in
and
it
works
its
still
refreshing
and
balanced
but
the
citrusypiney
hops
give
it
an
unexpected
twist
and
an
added
component
of
complexity
nicely
done
pretty
good
and
unique
flavor
and
great
looking
to
boot
beer
is
drinkable
wet
on
the
palate
mild
aftertaste
a
little
grainy
a
little
sweet
from
the
yeast
not
a
great
beer
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
just
dont
think
id
have
it
again
12oz
can
very
cloudy
tangerineorange

mandarin
tropical

lemongrass

a

overall
the
mandarin
orange
flavor
is
overpowering
and
too
dominant
this
wasnt
bad
just
not
something
id
get
again
overall
this
is
one
the
better
american
wheat
that
i
have
had
bonus
point
for
coming
out
of
a
can
and
being
so
reasonably
priced
overall
this
is
a
criminally
underrated
beer
in
my
opinion
i
dont
know
if
i
would
have
said
that
before
i
enjoyed
it
out
of
a
glass
which
really
seemed
to
kick
off
the
aromas
in
a
way
that
enhanced
the
flavor
as
well
tallgrass
really
has
the
makings
of
a
solid
portfolio
of
beers
and
this
is
one
of
their
best
o
a
great
sessionable
beer
and
the
can
format
makes
it
perfect
to
take
tailgating
camping
or
the
beach
the
crack
revealed
yet
another
brimful
craft
can
beautiful
the
glug
was
flawless
and
i
had
a
fingerandahalf
of
fizzing
bonewhite
head
that
popped
gurgled
and
fizzed
its
way
out
of
existence
color
was
a
fizzy

and
i
raised
a
toast
as
a
wussy
to
greg
koch
nose
was
really
clean
with
a
peppery
spiciness
up
front
accompanied
by
a
slight
fruitiness
and
a
light
mintiness
i
do
not
know
what
i
was
expecting
but
that
was
not
it
mouthfeel
was
fairly
full
thanks
to
all
of
the
carbonation
and
the
taste
was
subtle
less
intense
than
on
the
nose
but
with
all
of
the
characteristics
noted
earlier
the
peppery
bite
really
came
through
on
the
finish
making
it
very
dry
indeed
this
definitely
belongs
in
my
summer
beach
cooler
and
is
worthy
of
your
cansideration
also
drinkability
its
decent
it
is
probably
what
i
would
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
from
kansas
poured
from
a
can
to
a
hefeweizen
glass
deep
hazy
orange
with
a
generous
frothy
head
fairly
ight
on
lacing
the
nose
is
heavy
on
citrus
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
mostly
citrus
quite
sweet
hops
are
very
subdued
but
there
with
a
floral
undercut
mouthfeel
is
almost
creamy
long
lasting
pretty
good
wheat
offering
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
wheat
and
lemons
taste
is
the
same
wheat
and
lemon
some
bitterness
a
bit
mild
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
does
not
have
the
refreshing
qualities
of
some
wheat
beers
mediocre
im
a
bit
disappointed
that
it
isnt
hoppier
i
did
the
date
calculation
at
the
store
and
was
pretty
sure
that
it
was
fresh
enough
but
if
tallgrass
dates
six
months
out
this
is
as
good
as
four
months
old
halcyon
is
an
affordable
craft
can
summer
refresher
and
if
i
pick
up
another
six
i
will
rereview
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
out
of
a
12
oz
can
really
i
thought
they
only
did
pints
nice
amounts
of
lacing
came
from
the
inch
of
bright
white
head
faint
smells
of
hops
and
yeast
slight
hint
of
lemon
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
very
mellow

and
a
tiny
bit
bready
light
bodied
easy
drinking
beer
not
impressed
at
all
this
brewery
was
on
a
roll
until
i
had
this
can
even
for
a
wheat
beer
it
seems
too
bland

the

character
really
makes
this
a
refreshing
beer
im
glad
to
hear
that
it
went
year
round
mouthfeel
is
lighter

but
the

character
gives
it
some
added

ovrall
very
tasty
american

out
of
the
can
i
love
seeing
canned
offerings
out
there
that
taste
this
good
the
first
12
ounce
offering
ive
seen
from
tallgrass
most
of
their
other
beers
come
in
pounder
16
ounce
cans
o
this
beer
is
decent
its
not
on
the
level
of
some
other
wheat
beers
ive
had
but
id
drink
it
again
if
i
had
the
chance
o
if
i
am
going
to
like
a
wheat
beer
it
needs
to
taste
crisp
and
natural
this
one
doesnt
overall
a
pretty
decent
pale
wheat
too
much
raw
wheat
to
be
a
hefe
or
a
wit
this
fits
the
style
nicely
at

a

this
quenching
beer
could
be
a
summer
staple
d
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
out
in
the
sun
great
summer
beer
i
would
love
a
greater
malt
presence
to
give
a
little
more
substance
but
otherwise
im
enjoying
the
hoppyness
on
this
otherwise
yeastforward
brew
overall
a
simple
quenching
wheat
beer
versatile
with

an

up

up
being
a
nearly
perfect
snapshot
of
what
an
american
pale

ale
should
be
especially
for
a
style
that
perhaps
doesnt
get
enough
love
no
bells
or
whistles
just
a
great
wheat
beer
o
a
real
nice
easy
drinking
beer
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
othis
is
not
what
i
expected
but
a
very
drinkable
great
tasting
smooth
wheatwhat
else
could
you
ask
for
oh
yeah
i
picked
this
up
for
4
for
a
6
pack
i
better
stock
up
on
this
one
fantastic
my
new
favorite
wheat
overall
a
very
very
underrated
brew
in
my
opinion
puts
many
midwestern
wheats
to
shame
the
only
comparable
ones
i
can
think
of
are
the
free
state
golden
wheat
and
the
312
if
you
enjoy
the
newer
sweeter
revamped
american
version
of
wheat
beers
please
please
do
this
beer
justice
and
pick
it
up
when
you
get
a
chance
do
not
be
deceived
by
it
being
canned
o
overall
this
is
a
very
delicious
unique
wheat
beer
love
that
it
comes
in
a
can
tallgrass
is
one
of
the
regional
leaders
when
it
comes
to
using
cans
i
believe
that
is
all
they
use
no
bottles
and
i
hope
to
see
more
breweries
in
the
midwest
move
in
that
direction
refreshing
crisp
and
delightful
american
wheat
as
a
style
is
rather
bland
but
this
beer
manages
to
bring
some
nice
wheatmalt
flavors
along
with
some
light
hop
notes
to
add
complexity
an
awesome
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
thirst
quenching
above
average
american
style
wheat
a
fine
ale
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
at
the
beach
o
a
tremendous
wheat
beer
wonderfully
delicious
there
are
some
wheat
beers
that
use
a
lot
of
hops
but
then
it
loses
its
wheaty
presence
this
one
doesnt
too
that
there
is
a
delightlfully
wheaty
and
also
hoppy
well
balanced
highly
recommend
this
is
really
yummy
thats
all
ive
got
to
say
been
turning
the
heads
of
some
i
dont
like
wheat
beer
types
around
here
a
bit
bolder
hoppier
brighter
and
more
complex
than
oberon
sweet
bitter
a
touch
sour
and
crazily
thirst
quenching
like
this
one
lots
good
work
tallgrass
i
remain
a
fan
of
your
work
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
certainly
is
a
great
lawnmower
beer
the
body
is
light
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
slightly
fizzy
but
does
not
detract
from
the
flavors
a
little
more
carbonation
might
help
to
make
this
beer
more
crisp
but
it
is
very
drinkable
as
is
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
and
a
great
play
what
can
be
an
unfortunately
bland
style
overall
a
solid
pale
wheat
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
pleasant
carbonation
pretty
smooth
drinking
and
not
overcarbonated
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
its
about
an
average
wheat
beer
good
for
a
hot
day
though
i
picked
this
one
up
today
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
at
lukas
liquors
just
south
of
denver
surprised
that
this
can
was
a
12
ouncer
unlike
the
other
tallgrass
beers
oh
well
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
rocky
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
and
light
lemony
hops
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
with
wheat
and
more
citrus
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
definitely
i
could
go
back
and
forth
with
this
and
tallgrass
oasis
and
be
very
happy
all
summer
long
overall
impression
i
havent
had
a
craft
beer
in
a
can
for
a
while
so
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
of
it
i
found
this
to
be
extremely
drinkable
and
it
went
down
very
easily
after
being
outside
on
this
hot
day
the
flavors
were
mostly
yeasty
but
light
adding
a
bit
of
tastiness
but
leaving
it
very
drinkable
the
finish
was
slightly
citrusy
almost
effervescent
making
it
a
great
summer
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
into
my
dfh
signature
glass
great
one
finger
head
retains
with
great
lacing
aroma
of
wheat
and
hops
with
hints
of
bready
malts
and
yeast
taste
follows
the
nose
very
fresh
and
crisp
tasting
this
is
a
great
wheat
beer
that
flys
under
the
radar
o
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheats
but
this
wheat
bomb
is
fantastic
very
drinkable
beer
for
overall
its
a
simple
but
enjoyable
and
drinkable
wheat
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
great
beer
for
the
cooler
in
the
summer
taste
great
right
out
of
the
can
for
sporting
events
or
concert
tailgating
i
did
a
session
at
the
tailgate
party
with
several
of
these
and
they
hit
the
spot
would
grab
them
again
for
a
similar
event
overall
i
dont
think
is
a
terrible
representation
of
the
style
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
wheat
thanks
to
mcnuts
for
this
freebee
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
of
this
style
i
highly
recommend
it
d
another
winner
from
jeff
and
the
folks
in
manhattan
ks
light
mouthfeel
and
a
good
clean
finish
solid
wheat
that
would
be
excellent
all
summer
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
since
its
finally
getting
warmer
around
here
nice
crisp
wheat
beerits
not
gumballhead
but
it
is
hoppy
nice
change
of
pace
beer
or
summer
drinker
o
one
of
my
new
favorite
springsummer
session
beers
very
refreshing
everyone
who
ive
let
try
this
beer
really
enjoys
it
tallgrass
is
becoming
one
of
my
new
favorite
breweries
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
two
inches
of
billowy
eggshell
white
colored
foam
that
recedes
at
a
glacial
pace
into
a
fluffy
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
tangerines
and
some
tangy
wheat
it
is
a
very
vibrant
aroma
the
taste
is
full
of
citrus
fruit
with
a
hint
of
tang
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
chewy
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
impressive
american
pale
wheat
ale
it
has
far
more
flavor
that
nearly
every
other
beer
ive
had
of
this
style
i
am
a
much
bigger
fan
of
hefes
and
would
almost
always
choose
one
over
a
pale
wheat
ale
however
i
this
beer
is
good
enough
that
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
again
overall
great
wheat
beer
i
love
the
thickness
of
the
beer
but
wish
that
there
were
actually
more
citra
hops
in
it
when
i
had
it
two
months
ago
as
fresh
as
can
be
it
was
more
of
a
standout
would
have
been
an
a
i
will
make
sure
next
year
i
grab
a
six
pack
right
away
the
taste
is
more
floral
as
well
hardly
any
wheat
malt
backbone
no
wheat
malt
mouthfeel
and
certainly
no
fruity
wheat
flavor
its
got
some
i
suppose
but
this
beer
is
more
like
a
pale
ale
that
accidentally
had
some
wheat
malt
spilled
in
it
d
pretty
decent
wheat
beer
it
is
more
flavorful
than
your
run
of
the
mill
apwas
but
not
earth
shattering
then
again
is
it
supposed
to
be
i
would
buy
this
again
very
easy
going
and
refreshing
beer
this
would
easily
replace
hoegaarden
in
my
fridge
during
the
summer
were
it
not
that
i
live
in
ms
where
this
beer
is
unavailable
overall
this
is
a
reallly
well
made
wheat
beer
and
probably
one
of
my
new
favorites
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
beer
many
times
this
summer
this
beer
has
almost
no
taste
okay
its
innocuous
doesnt
actually
taste
bad
and
is
slightly
more
refreshing
than
cold
water
but
i
want
flavor
from
my
beer
and
this
is
not
a
comment
on
the
style
ive
recently
had
several
pale
wheat
ales
that
i
found
flavorful
dont
think
its
a
freshness
issue
as
im
pretty
sure
this
just
hit
our
shelves
in
the
last
couple
weeks
i
do
not
plan
to
drink
this
again
very
hop
forward
on
the
flavor
and
definitely
qualifies
as
a
thirst
quencher
although
probably
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
over
and
over
again
overall
seems
like
they
were
aiming
for
something
more
akin
to
oberon
vs
the
typical
american
wheat
and
it
is
a
pretty
good
wheat
beer
as
the
citra
hops
make
it
unique
but
the
oddly
sweet
taste
keeps
this
from
being
great
cheers
halcyon
has
the
least
flavor
of
all
the
tall
grass
beers
and
yet
i
think
it
might
be
their
best
it
is
exactly
what
an
american
unfiltered
wheat
should
be
and
the
picture
of
a
perfect
canned
beer
for
the
summer
perhaps
the
best
example
of
tempreture
turning
a
pedestrian
beer
in
to
someting
truly
interesting
a
good
wheat
ale
that
is
not
as
exciting
as
offerings
from
lagunitas
and
three
floyds
better
than
most
others
however
good
but
not
great
happy
for
the
folks
at
tallgrass
as
they
continue
to
produce
quality
beers
edit
17jul2011
bumped
the
overall
to
five
because
this
stuff
is
just
so
damn
perfect
for
summer
that
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
a
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
summer
beer
not
the
most
interesting
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
in
a
can
which
are
two
huge
plusses
for
a
summer
brew
great
drinkability
nice
refreshing
really
grew
on
me
as
this
warms
this
could
easily
become
one
of
my
summers
favorite
beers
great
taste
and
easy
to
carry
around
in
a
can
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
offering
from
tallgrass
i
would
like
to
do
a
side
by
side
tasting
with
gumballhead
itd
be
very
close
all
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
an
amazing
beer
for
hot
days
lots
of
flavor
and
creamy
body
thats
still
light
and
refreshing
for
the
style
halcyon
has
a
very
thick
body
this
is
easily
the
most
creamy
american
pale
wheat
ive
ever
had
despite
this
the
carbonation
level
is
onpoint
impressive
overall
this
is
a
unique
take
on
the
style
that
is
very
worthy
of
competing
with
the
big
dogs
of
the
style
an
interesting
session
choice
that
is
equally
at
home
when
enjoyed
out
of
a
glass
or
swigged
out
of
the
can
at
a
cookout
o
a
great
summer
wheat
that
is
easy
drinking
has
lots
of
flavor
ill
be
drinking
this
one
alot
update
found
out
they
use
citra
hops
which
i
believe
adds
a
lot
of
character
to
this
beer
theres
another
hop
also
but
i
will
need
to
look
that
up
as
i
cant
recall
off
the
top
of
my
head
got
this
info
from
an
info
card
they
gave
out
at
the
kansas
sampler
festival
overalll
this
was
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
solid
flavors
i
really
like
the
citrus
definitely
one
to
have
around
for
the
summer
overall
a
very
good
beer
perhaps
my
favorite
by
tallgrass
will
buy
more
of
this
overall
quite
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
one
that
i
would
grab
if
i
was
craving
classic
wheat
flavor
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
the
two
sixers
i
bought
went
pretty
fast
the
chalkiness
is
the
biggest
downfall
and
makes
this
one
more
pleasing
at
coolercold
temperatures
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
isnt
quite
like
your
traditional
german
wheat
beer
really
good
though
overall
id
say
that
drinkability
is
ok
almost
a
session
beer
id
like
to
smell
taste
more
bubblegum
in
this
banana
too
pretty
good
american
version
of
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
prosit
o
wow
im
only
paying
6
56
for
a
sixpack
of
this
stuff
jesus
ill
pay
that
anyday
im
gonna
miss
it
in
the
fall
mouthfeel
is
a
little
heavier
than
most
pale
wheat
ales
this
seems
to
fall
some
where
in
the
middle
between
a
wheat
ale
and
a
hefeweizen
there
is
a
mild
creaminess
in
the
texture
but
is
not
filling
like
a
lot
of
hefeweizens
can
be
im
liking
this
beer
more
and
more
o
this
is
a
really
good
wheat
beer
aroma
was
fantastic
and
it
tasted
good
too
this
beer
is
awesome
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
summer
seasonal
very
excited
for
more
of
this
hard
to
be
more
refreshing
than
that
who
said
you
cannot
add
lots
of
hops
to
a
wheat
beer
and
still
feels
great
the
only
sin
is
its
body
it
sure
could
be
bolder
even
being
very
light
to
me
this
looked
and
tasted
like
a
summer
beer
but
i
drank
the
one
in
my
fridge
rather
than
wait
6
months
or
so
it
pour
a
relatively
bright
light
color
with
a
good
head
the
taste
had
lemon
notes
and
not
light
and
perhaps
crisp
hops
half
acre
akari
shogun
3
55
taste
is
very
nice
bitter
and
crisp
and
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
light
excellent
i
could
drink
a
number
of
these
in
a
sitting
hazy
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
hop
forward
aroma
with
underlying
wheat
grass
floral
notes
more
ipa
character
than
wheat
beer
with
hops
leading
the
charge
easy
drinking
a
tasty
beer
it
would
be
easy
to
have
several
of
these
in
a
session
well
done
good
beer
overall
really
nice
hoppy
wheat
beer
the
hops
definitely
steal
the
show
but
theyre
not
too
overpowering
to
prevent
the
wheat
from
playing
too
really
really
enjoyable
thanks
to
batfireman
for
sending
this
as
an
extra
o
refreshing
and
unique
hoppy
american
pale
wheat
ale
featuring
hops
from
new
zealand
i
would
buy
this
again
especially
in
the
summertime
overall
i
did
not
expect
a
wheat
beer
to
have
such
a
hop
presence
however
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
good
looking
and
great
for
the
summer
months
overall
nice
to
see
half
acre
showing
some
restraint
with
the
hops
here
the
wonderful
wheat
and
malt
flavors
come
through
but
the
distinct
bitterness
leaves
this
a
little
less
refreshing
than
id
expect
for
a
wheat
beer
especially
as
it
warms
o
crisp
crushable
and
refreshing
so
so
good
my
only
major
question
is
where
the
hell
does
the
name
come
from
i
mean
i
guess
where
do
any
names
come
from
but
this
one
is
confounding
akari
shogun
is
a
summer
drinker
my
go
to
as
a
matter
of
fact
citric
hoppiness
wheat
tang
manageable
bitterness
and
extreme
drinkability
give
this
guy
a
gold
star
too
bad
its
37
out
in
the
glass
akari
shogun
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
hue
topped
with
a
moderately
retained
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
carries
elegant
floral
tones
blossoming
into
a
fruit
salad
arrangement
of
tangerine
apricot
and
peach
while
also
boasting
a
sweet
candied
bubblegum
seductive
wheat
sweetness
and
lemon
citrus
brightly
tease
the
palate
while
tamed
by
assertive
hop
bitterness
grass
and
rose
petal
sensations
delicately
join
lemon
and
mango
juiciness
throughout
the
taste
the
mildly
lasting
finish
is
semidry
and
allows
the
wheat
notes
to
shine
refreshing
and
delicate
enough
on
the
palate
to
make
this
a
perfect
warm
weather
beverage
on
the
whole
this
is
a
world
class
brew
my
expectations
were
nonexistent
but
this
is
great
on
a
whole
different
level
than
gumballhead
which
i
previously
thought
was
pretty
solid
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
wheat
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
the
mouthfeel
is
off
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
my
favorite
beer
by
half
acre
and
one
of
the
best
out
of
chicagoland
outstanding
and
surprisingly
sessionable
if
you
clear
he
rest
of
your
day
pours

with
a
bit
of
lace
remaining
smells
earthydirt
with
faded
citrus
taste
and
mouthfeel
a
bit
off
the
mark
for
me
very
bitter
taste
of
earthy
tones
with
a
bit
of
citrus
sweetness
and
a
medium
malt
backbone
that
i
cant
quite
pick
out
a
flavor
i
definitely
can
imagine
a
walnut
type
nut
being
used
in
this
brew
medium
body
with
an
extreme
dry
finish
almost
hard
to
swallow
after
taking
a
sip
thanks
to
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
very
lemony
a
touch
of
wheat
taste
is
good
lemons
wheat
some
grapefruit
a
good
bit
of
hops
are
present
very
easy
drinking
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
brew
o
exceptional
from
start
to
finish
akari
shogun
is
a
beautifully
hopped
beer
that
perfectly
balances
an
elevated
hop
level
with
a
smooth
wheat
body
and
crisp
finish
perfect
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
the
crack
revealed
yet
another
brimful
craft
can
and
i
executed
a
samurai
glug
cleaving
the
can
in
two
and
letting
its
cantents
spill
into
the
glass
no
actually
i
employed
an
inverted
glug
resulting
in
a
fingerandahalf
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
cloudy
orangishyellow
nose
had
a
lemongrapefruitcitrusiness
to
it
nose
was
more
hoppy
than
i
expected
and
i
canfess
to
unfamiliarity
with
that
particular
strain
mentioned
in
the
notes
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
effervescent
and
i
felt
as
though
i
were
picking
up
where
i
left
off
with
that
radler
earlier
the
taste
was
odd
peppery
citrusy
quite
unexpected
the
finish
was
quite
dry
with
the
pepper
and
citrus
flavors
combining
nicely
it
did
not
seem
to
fit
the
style
and
i
am
not
a
style
maven
by
any
stretch
but
it
caught
me
off
guard
it
might
be
nice
on
a
hot
humid
summers
day
but
i
was
left
unimpressed
got
this
in
a
very
generous
trade
along
with
gumballhead
lots
of
people
compare
the
two
huh
not
even
close
poured
slightly
hazy
with
a
white
foamy
head
and
very
little
nose
it
had
even
less
flavor
i
guess
ill
just
agree
to
disagree
with
the
majority
on
this
one
odloved
it
daisy
cutter
is
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
and
this
one
is
similar
in
some
essences
in
a
very
small
sample
size
half
acre
seems
to
be
all
its
cracked
up
to
be
overall
a
nice
gumballhead
substitute
what
a
beer
wasnt
expecting
much
was
just
lucky
enough
to
get
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
funny
thing
was
that
one
can
busted
during
transport
but
when
it
arrived
i
totally
poured
out
what
was
left
in
the
can
and
the
ziplock
bag
and
tried
it
on
the
spot
even
flat
and
warm
it
was
still
delicious
juicy
is
the
one
word
id
use
to
summarize
this
beer
juicy
tropical
refreshing
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
and
completely
delicious
overall
half
acre
does
light
hoppy
beers
so
well
no
exception
here
i
would
sooner
drink
a
miller
product
m
light
to
medium
bodied
this
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazed
yellow
color
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
on
top
some
moderate
lacing
and
retention
here
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
big
lively
citrusy
hops
on
the
nose
the
taste
has
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
as
well
with
the
subtle
softness
of
the
wheat
filling
in
later
on
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
light
bodied
very
refreshing
overall
its
a
very
good
brew
would
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
this
is
my
new
goto
wheat
ale
whenever
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
delicious
straight
out
of
the
can
as
well
one
of
the
best
new
beers
ive
had
this
year
a
light
to
moderate
mouthfeel
a
soft
carbonation
but
the
bitterness
balances
well
a
great
lingering
hop
finish
a
bit
too
dry
on
the
back
end
but
still
good
overall
a
great
hoppy
ipa
wheat
extremely
drinkable
overall
another
good
american
pale
wheat
ale
that
is
hop
forward
obviously
a
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
overall
this
is
pretty
underwhelming
and
weak
watery
wheat
pale
ale
with
no
chewy
backbone
and
virtually
no
flavor
this
is
an
easy
drinking
wheat
that
satisfies
hop
cravings
i
imagine
this
to
be
a
great
summer
beer
and
am
stoked
theyll
be
canning
it
through
the
summer
j
o
very
tasty
pale

love
the
aroma
on
this
beer
overall
a
good

good
job
half
acre
overall
another
great
beer
from
half
acre
this
is
a
great
version
of
the
style
that
has
summer
written
all
over
it
poured
in
a
snifter
appearance
is
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
that
leve
some
splotchy
lacing
the
nose
features
a
strong
wheaty
grain
profile
with
lemon
drops
and
passion
fruity
the
hops
are
present
but
somewhat
tame
the
taste
has
plenty
of
wheat
backbone
and
some
dry
grapefruit
bitterness
not
much
sweetness
here
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
decent
little
whet
beer
nothing
earth
shattering
o
really
impressed
with
the
balance
and
easy
drinking
of
this
beer
i
hope
this
makes
more
appearances
in
the
ha
rotation
o
this
tasted
like
a
slightly
wheated
version
of
daisy
cutter
which
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
to
begin
with
great
aroma
but
the
taste
is
dry
grassy
and
boring
gotta
love
these
half
acre
labels
amiright
anyway
the
beer
itself
pours
a
cloudy
straw
topped
by
a
sturdy
finger
of
eversolightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
rind
leek
light
cantaloupe
light
pineapple
and
a
pinch
of
coriander
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
some
orange
rind
some
overlyripe
mandarin
orange
and
a
bit
of
wild
rice
unfortunately
a
stiff
bitterness
pervades
the
finish
malingering
for
a
tad
too
long
sorta
ruining
things
a
bit
at
the
end
its
not
enough
to
raze
things
completely
thankfully
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
grainy
feel
overall
a
solid
fruity
wheat
beer
but
its
nothing
overtly
special
o
the
bright
full
hops
have
some
nice
depth
and
blends
together
a
lot
of
different
characteristics
this
has
a
full
mouthfeel
but
it
is
not
a
filling
beer
very
sessionable
pungent
citrusy
aroma
at
first
becoming
grainy
and
wheaty
over
time
a
certain
sweet
earthiness
and
grassy
character
from
the
mouteka
hop
variety
first
sips
are
very
reminiscent
of
tasty
waves
and
daisy
cutter
albeit
with
wheat
and
a
different
hop
variety
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
earthy
grassy
bitterness
lingers
alongside
bitter
grapefruit
zest
the
nz
hops
do
lend
some
distinct
character
and
overall
its
pretty
tasty
especially
for
the
style
definitely
feeling
the
summer
vibes
with
this
one
d
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
that
does
not
suck
really
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
the
hot
summer
weather
also
appropriately
priced
at
5
9922oz
watch
out
gumballhead
o
a
very
drinkable
american
wheat
ale
aggressively
hopped
but
with
with
a
lot
more
wheat
character
than
is
typically
seen
in
this
category
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
one
make
its
way
to
cans
one
day
o
this
is
going
to
be
our
summer
beer
without
a
doubt
the
balance
is
fantastic
i
respect
that
they
didnt
go
the
safe
route
and
brew
something
that
youd
see
the
trixies
swilling
in
wrigleyville
this
brew
is
classic
half
acre
and
kicks
some
serious
ibus
a
great
wheat
ale
that
i
am
gonna
enjoy
all
summer
long
o
im
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
one
is
pretty
well
done
highly
hopped
for
the
style
with
citrus
and
pine
notes
o
a
pretty
damn
tasty
beer
its
very
hop
forward
and
probably
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
hefeweizen
but
is
still
an
awesome
beer
if
this
was
available
in
fourpacks
it
might
be
the
first
wheat
beer
i
would
actually
pick
up
regularly
this
is
the
worst
belgianstylewitbierstyle
ive
had
out
of
the
maybe
56
or
so
that
ive
tried
definitely
not
recommended
normally
i
find
that
i
can
give
cheap
beers
good
ratings
but
its
certainly
not
the
case
here
im
surprised
others
gave
better
reviews
perhaps
its
related
to
the
batch
i
had
andor
the
fact
that
i
had
it
just
several
days
before
its
bestbefore
date
rather
refreshing
and
tasty
in
my
opinion
delicious
that
is
above
all
else
it
looks
a
creamy
pale
goldyellow
a
very
inviting
look
and
feel
the
aroma
is
mild
sort
of
spicy
with
citrisy
tones
i
began
to
lose
optinism
for
the
beer
as
i
do
not
like
beers
that
use
orange
peel
or
coriander
and
this
beer
reaked
of
that
but
the
taste
is
not
how
it
smells
its
perfectly
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
balanced
citrisyfruity
taste
love
this
beer
will
buy
again
buy
a
case
overall
a
fair
american
wheat
ale
long

very
sessionable

with

i
gave
this
wheat
beer
a
shot
and
it
wasnt
too
bad
but
im
still
not
all
the
way
there
on
wheats
this
one
wasnt
as
sour
as
some
reviews
indicate
and
i
could
get
a
nice
citrus
flavor
in
it
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
not
a
bad
representation
of
it
i
actually
liked
this
better
than
sunshine
wheat
which
is
their
more
popular
and
longstanding
version
overall
a
decent
brew
with
a
good
yeasty
wheaty
and
sour
green
apple
taste
due
to
the
green
apple
flavor
it
is
not
as
refreshing
as
others
but
it
is
still
very
nice
the
description
on
beer
advisor
mentions
something
about
bacteria
that
make
lactic
acid
to
produce
a
sour
beer
but
going
only
halfway
makes
this
a
poor
choice
its
not
a
traditional
relaxing
wheat
beer
and
its
not
a
well
executed
sour
beer
steer
clear
pours
from
the
can
with
a
cloudy
golden
color
and
forms
only
a
modest
head
but
it
still
leaves
decent
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
subtle
combination
of
an
earthymusty
character
with
some
white
bread
the
flavor
likewise
has
a
mildly
lemony
yeast
character
that
provides
brightness
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
the
mild
flavors
are
supported
however
by
a
texture
that
is
light
but
still
has
some
substance
overall
although
certainly
light
on
flavor
this
one
is
inoffensive
and
somewhat
refreshing
making
it
easy
and
drinkable
disappointed
is
all
i
have
to
say
about
this
one
i
popped
the
top
took
a
whiff
and
was
repulsed
this
is
easily
on
of
the
worst
smelling
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
it
smells
of
rotten
wheat
not
fresh
at
all
normally
i
am
a
big
fan
of
new
belgium
but
they
bungled
this
one
for
sure
the
beers
color
is
watery
and
looks
dirty
the
aroma
as
i
mentioned
earlier
is
atrocious
it
is
bitter
beyond
enjoyment
and
the
amount
of
carbonation
is
insane
i
wanted
to
like
this
but
it
didnt
happen
so
i
have
to
recommend
to
avoid
this
one
o
very
refreshing
wheat
beer
some
nice
flavors
going
on
here
definitely
not
your
typical
wheat
beer
not
entirely
convinced
that
i
would
buy
this
again
i
expect
this
type
of
sourness
from
wild
ales
not
necessarily
from
wheat
beers

the
wheat
taste
here
is
more
pronounced
than
others
ive
tasted
you
can
taste
the
wheat
clearly
in
the
aftertaste
it
has
a
sour
smarties
candy
tart
flavor
intertwined
with
the
citrus
and
wheat
flavors
which
is
not
bad
at
all
in
my
opinion
overall
a
very
good
wheat
ale
almost
as
good
if
not
better
than
blue
moon
depending
on
the
day
mood
and
the
meal
o
this
beer
isnt
as
bad
as
advertised
but
it
is
very
uneven
thats
about
it
i
snapped
and
cracked
that
can
open
and
used
an
inverted
glug
to
get
it
shot
out

into
my
glass
the

very

not
bad
at
all
would
i
buy
a
sixer
hm
now
that
is
a
question
at
first
i
would
have
said
no
but
as
im
getting
down
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
think
this
beer
would
be
worthy
of
a
rotation
try
it
if
you
havent
yet
overall
this
beer
started
off
promising
but
the
initial
characteristics
took
a
turn
still
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
sessionable
one
at
that
popped
the
top
to
an
aroma
of
someone
farting
in
a
wet
bathing
suit
in
a
hot
car
tart
is
accurate
which
paired
well
with
my
dry
numb
pallet
after
a
pack
of
newports
pretty
run
of
the
mill
wheat
beer
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
whoever
said
it
tastes
like
blue
moon
was
spot
on
overall
ive
got
a
bit
of
love
for
this
beer
if
only
because
its
not
as
bland
as
i
expected
see
sierra
nevada
old
chico
those
who
hate
sour
beers
should
probably
look
elsewhere
its
a
bit
of
a
one
note
wonder
but
whats
there
is
pretty
good
if
you
like
a
nice

the

overall
i
really
enjoyed

and
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
wheat
beer
i
would
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
and
it
was
reasonably
priced
as
well
well
its
a
tart
and
refreshing
drink
the
color
is
a
pale
cloudy
yellow
with
hardly
any
head
the
smell
is
mostly
lemon
at
first
and
second
whiffs
the
taste
is
something
tart
with
dashes
of
lemon
its
good
but
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
best
on
a
hot
day
o
a
good
beer
overall
simple
but
enjoyable
and
refreshing
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
a
normally
bland
and
boring
style
moderate
spice
and
earthiness
before
a
relatively
mild
lemony
lactic
tartness
at
the
finish
light
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
id
have
it
again
overall
i
love
wheat
beers
and
i
love
flemmish
sour
ales
so
this
worked
for
me
not
overly
tart
or
vinegary
with
the
sourness
like
some
sours
and
its
all
balanced
very
well
with
a
good
wheat
beer
not
my
favorite
but
a
decent
beer
this
is
a
good
american
wheat
i
usually
choose
a
belgian
witt
but
snapshot
is
a
nice
change
it
isnt
heavy
feeling
and
doesnt
bite
back
like
some
american
wheat
beers
it
is
a
little
lighterthinner
tasting
than
a
belgian
witt
but
very
drinkable
i
also
like
the
fact
that
new
belgium
is
employee
owned
it
is
pretty
bland
except
for
the
tart
touch
in
the
finish
a
decent
american
pale
wheat
ale
o
a
refreshing
spin
on
a
pretty
standard
wheat
beer
eh
its
alright
o
just
another
wheat
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
typical
of
the
style
only
about
a
halffinger
of
head
that
faded
quickly
but
left
plenty
of
lacing
surprisingly
not
much
aroma
at
all
citrus
notes
are
there
but
not
pronounced
either
in
smell
or
taste
low
bitterness
one
of
the
reasons
i
like
this
style
mouthfeel
is
tangy
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
i
find
it
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
glad
i
have
five
more
in
the
fridge
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
5
abv
best
by
date
of
101214
the
carbonation
quickly
fizzled
out
and
we
were
left
with
lemon
iced
tea
in
our
mouths
without
the
tea
either
we
werent
impressed
with
wheat
beer
or
this
may
not
be
the
best
out
there
thanks
ellen
easily
accessible
but
at
least
somewhat
interesting
this
is
a
beer
that
could
appeal
to
a
wide
crowd
its
a
good
wheat
ale
but
nothing
special
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
of
lemons
and
wheat
taste
is
refreshing
lemony
a
mild
tartness
a
bit
of
wheat
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
the
sum
is
better
than
the
parts
a
good
warm
weather
session
beer
i
thought
this
was
a
very
pleasant
beer
its
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
with
notes
of
orange
and
vanilla
its
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
fresh
citrus
scent
and
slight
floral
notes
not
too
much
else
to
say
about
it
besides
the
fact
that
its
well
balanced
and
tastes
pretty
similar
to
other
wheat
beers
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
bad
its
a
solid
choice
if
your
heading
to
the
beach
or
just
staying
outside
on
those
hot
days
o
it
sounded
interesting
when
i
read
the
description
in
the
store
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
not
my
favorite
but
m
glad
i
got
to
try
it
overall
an
odd
beer
for
the
style
it
has
a
very
appealing
appearance
great
head
fair
lacing
bright
color
but
the
aroma
is
neither
spicy
nor
phenolic
the
flavor
is
pretty
weak
but
holding
my
nose
while
i
drink
helps
i
dont
know
if
this
particular
bottle
is
infected
but
i
dont
think
so
particularly
after
the
other
new
belgium
beers
ive
had
i
guess
i
just
dont
find
their
flavor
palate
particularly
appealing
to
each
their
own
the
palest
of
straw
colors
a
little
cloudy
with
a
large
airy
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
with
some
grainy
wheat
notes
the
flavor
is
very
light
wheat
with
very
low
bitterness
but
is
nicely
acidicthe
one
redeeming
feature
i
still
am
disappointed
they
ditched
the
light
coriandertouched
sunshine
wheat
and
replaced
it
with
this
it
is
refreshing
though
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
13oz
tulip
a
pale
yellow
beer
with
some
haze
and
a
very
weak
aroma
of
wheat
and
citrus
the
taste
is
of
a
simple
beer
with
lemon
wheat
and
a
slight
spice
overall
not
strong
on
the
tongue
and
a
light
watery
feel
that
goes
down
quick
a
good
beer
for
someone
trying
to
step
up
from
bud
light
overall
big
fan
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
do
not
particularly
like
sour
ales
but
this
is
only
very
lightly
sour
and
otherwise
a
light
dry
pleasant
wheat
beer
i
would
pick
up
another
one
of
these
if
i
was
going
to
the
beach
or
something
review
edit
i
made
my
first
review
after
1
can
ive
now
had
a
full
6
pack
over
4
days
and
every
time
i
come
back
to
this
i
like
it
a
little
more
this
is
my
new
favorite
summer
beer
but
im
a
sour
head
in
mn
and
we
have
a
very
poor
selection
of
berliners
gose
am
wild
ales
ect
its
almost
like
surly
misanthrope
but
less
sour
and
more
wheaty
anyways
i
like
it
much
more
than
the
80
rating
that
it
has
right
now
o
a
nice
mild
wheat
on
a
summer
afternoon
but
i
expected
more
from
new
belgium
since
im
a
big
fan
of
their
ipas
im
not
a
fan
of
light
beer
at
all
and
this
had
a
mildly
similar
weak
watereddown
flavor
an
easydrinking
beer
but
disappointing
since
its
not
as
tasty
as
id
hoped
it
has
a
nice
dose
of
creamy
wheatines
on
the
aroma
the
taste
begins
with
the
wheat
but
then
finishes
with
a
slight
sourness
it
is
actually
refreshing
but
a
little
acidic
feeling
which
i
do
not
care
for
its
ok
but
nothing
special
very
good
for
people
who
like
lighter
beers
personally
its
just
slightly
better
than
ok
to
me
but
if
you
need
to
get
a
friend
out
of
their
bland
beer
rut
give
them
this
probably
the
most
flavor
youll
find
in
a
lighter
beer
with
no
scary
bitterness
overall
the
finish
is
what
i
like
most
as
for
taste
it
is
pretty
simple
certainly
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
in
place
of
some
lemonade
or
shandy
overall
a
fairly
decent
wheat
beer
i
like
the
slightly
sour
finish
a
pale
yellow
beer
with
some
haze
and
a
very
weak
aroma
of
wheat
and
lemon
the
taste
was
a
bit
astrigent
and
sour
with
lemon
wheat
and
a
slight
spice
being
the
primary
tastes
overall
not
strong
on
the
tongue
and
a
light
watery
feel
that
goes
down
quick
a
pedestrian
and
lackluster
beer
in
my
opinion
watery
light
and
sour
i
struggle
to
appreciate
wheat
beer
in
general
but
this
beer
certainly
does
not
score
high
in
my
book
o
not
bad
but
not
great
it
could
have
used
more
sourness
or
none
at
all
it
is
clean
and
inoffensive
though
which
is
nice
its
well
crafted
but
still
pretty
pedestrian
id
like
it
more
if
they
would
have
dialed
it
up
a
notch
or
two
well
yes
there
is
lots
of
citrus
in
the
flavor
overall
its
a
pretty
good
whit
especially
if
you
like
things
on
the
lighter
side
i
would
still
favor
a
blue
moon
which
has
a
bit
more
punch
in
the
flavor
department
very
light
cloudy
with
average
lacing
the
smell
is
wheat
and
yeast
with
citrus
background
the
taste
is
sour
up
front
with
a
bland
wheat
and
slight
candy
lemon
with
a
tangy
finish
mouthfeel
is
thin
good
for
a
hott
day
in
the
heat
but
besides
that
kinda
average
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing

o

this
is
pretty
decent
new
belgium
snapshot
wheat
beer
45
overall
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
with
traditional
flavours
and
a
surprising
tart
twist
this
is
one
for
the
summer
season
the
third
new
belgium
beer
to
arrive
here
in
alberta
reviews
not
in
order
poured
a
single
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
a
cloudy
lemon
yellow
with
a
fizzy
sparkly
white
head
aroma
smells
almost
exactly
like
gummy
bears
with
some
added
dry
white
pepper
lemon
rind
and
carbolic
winelike
notes
smells
wonderfully
sweet
and
tart
at
the
same
time
palate
features
a
doughy
bread
backbone
but
this
is
downplayed
in
favor
of
lemon
juice
peppery
wheat
spice
another
spice
seed
element
coriander
perhaps
and
faint
raspberry
and
apple
esters
there
in
the
background
i
detect
some
yeasty
funk
as
well
although
this
is
buried
compared
to
the
other
elements
i
have
described
aggressively
carbonated
a
little
prickly
on
the
mouth
and
remains
lemonysour
on
the
finish
it
is
impossible
to
escape
an
overall
citric
tart
vibe
cut
rather
minimally
with
a
more
malty
sweetness
great
stuff
really
tastes
like
there
is
some
berliner
weiss
in
its
ancestry
somewhere
considerably
quantities
are
going
to
be
consumed
on
this
patio
if
we
ever
fucking
get
some
summer
here
this
should
cut
thirst
like
a
mofo
although
it
might
be
a
tough
sell
to
the
folks
more
used
to
that
classic
grasshopper
and
velvet
fog
appleyeast
sweetness
picked
up
one
of
these
as
part
of
a
ye
ole
mixed
six
on
the
recommendation
of
my
beer
guru
great
looking
beer
with
a
good
clean
and
crisp
smell
and
taste
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
out
standing
beer
that
i
very
much
enjoyed
will
be
willing
to
snag
a
sixer
of
this
to
enjoy
at
the
fire
pit
this
summer
o
overall
its
an
excellent
crisp
and
refreshing
summer
beer
a
great
compliment
for
spring
weather
i
recommend
hey
this
is
not
bad
one
part
belgian
pale
one
part
berliner
weisse
and
one
part
boring
american
wheat
results
in
a
crisp
clean
summer
ale
while
this
one
is
no
substitute
for
a
proper
sour
beer
it
does
a
good
job
putting
me
in
the
mood
for
one
pours
a
partly
hazy
very
pale
straw
yellow
with
medium
soft
white
head
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
retention
but
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
loads
of
soft
wheaty
aroma
with
hints
of
lemon
zest
and
a
bit
of
honey
smells
very
clean
on
the
palate
there
is
a
definite
sourness
that
strikes
first
although
somewhat
lightany
more
would
turn
it
into
a
berliner
weisse
tastes
very
reminiscent
of
a
radler
half
beer
and
half
lemonade
practically
thin
as
water
alcohol
not
apparent
at
all
carbonation
diminishes
quickly
the
longer
you
take
to
drink
it
the
more
it
loses
its
snap
definitely
a
beer
for
quaffing
down
quickly
on
a
hot
summer
day
all
in
all
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
performs
well
in
the
heat
of
summer
am
i
the
only
one
who
really
doesnt
like
new
belgiums
new
branding
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
and
light
flowers
anything
else
disappears
into
the
small
ether
space
between
the
surface
and
my
strils
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
lemon
here
is
fairly
tart
didnt
see
that
coming
honestly
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
surprisingly
sour
wheat
one
that
i
could
easily
see
drinking
more
of
in
the
near
future
o
this
is
a
fairly
typical
wheat
beer
with
a
subtle
souring
perhaps
too
subtle
the
citrus
is
limited
and
i
found
most
of
the
flavors
fairly
muted
no
missteps
just
not
terribly
interesting
o
not
only
does
new
belgium
have
a
penchant
for
constantly
creating
new
extremely
drinkable
summertime
beers
but
they
also
have
a
big
love
for
sours
while
sours
have
exploded
in
popularity
in
the
craft
beer
community
theyre
not
quite
ready
for
the
mainstream
and
thats
where
snapshot
comes
in
new
belgiums
snapshot
takes
everything
great
about
a
pale
wheat
ale
its
drinkability
refreshing
quality
and
light
sessionable
flavor
and
adds
a
twist
of
tart
lactobacillus
a
souring
bacteria
for
us
exploratory
drinkers
its
reminiscent
of
a
german
berliner
weisse
while
it
maintains
great
training
wheel
characteristics
for
those
uninitiated
looking
to
get
their
feet
wet
in
the
wild
world
of
sours
like
many
of
their
lighter
offerings
usually
do
during
the
warmer
months
snapshot
will
have
a
permanent
place
in
my
fridge
this
summer
pours
a
hazy
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
and
sides
of
the
glass
some
spottystreaky
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
with
some
citrus
and
floral
hops
the
taste
started
out
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
lemon
grass
and
wheat
but
followed
by
a
hoppy
taste
that
lingered
to
long
afterwards
slightly
aboveaverage
carbonation
wasnt
a
bad
brew
but
that
hoppy
aftertaste
was
a
bit
unpleasant
for
me
overall
had
this
in
a
bottle
around
the
campfire
i
thought
overall
it
is
a
pretty
average
beer
except
the
hop
character
is
poor
in
my
opinion
it
had
an
unpleasing
hop
twang
in
the
finish
that
i
couldnt
get
over
it
almost
tasted
like
an
acidic
lactic
thing
was
going
on
and
made
the
finish
really
harsh
othis
is
a
pretty
simple
beer
and
not
one
that
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
but
i
could
endorse
this
for
summertime
shenanigans
im
not
totally
sold
on
the
hefemeetspale
concept
here
but
the
beer
is
wellconstructed
and
there
are
no
off
flavors
aboveaverage
a
pretty
good
wheat
ale
would
be
a
great
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
nice
for
the
summer
the
nose
was
a
bit
subdued
at
times
but
an
enjoyable
flavor
and
well
done
beer
overall
oa
bland
boring
beer
that
brings
nothing
great
to
the
table
the
best
thing
that
can
be
said
is
that
there
is
nothing
awful
about
this
beer
bought
a
1
bottle
sampler
to
try
poured
cold
into
a
tulip
looks
average
with
a
nice
murky
yellow
color
and
small
1
finger
head
a
little
lacing
but
not
much
has
a
very
pleasant
smell
not
too
sweet
but
a
mix
of
slight
sweetness
and
wheat
grain
that
is
well
balanced
same
with
the
taste
its
packed
with
flavor
but
very
well
balanced
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
slight
tartnesssourness
doughy
flavor
and
a
hint
of
hop
crispness
in
finish
i
really
like
the
mix
of
whats
going
on
with
this
beer
nearly
perfectly
balanced
imo
for
an
american
wheat
ale
an
excellent
summer
session
beer
hopefully
this
one
stays
on
the
shelves
for
a
while
as
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
one
snapshot
pours
a
hazy
and
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
large
lacing
and
frothy
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sour
and
stale
the
taste
however
is
very
creamy
good
creamy
wheat
flavors
very
crisp
and
refreshing
malt
notes
with
hints
of
orange
good
flavors
bold
flavors
just
a
tad
over
carbonated
overall
a
very
good
tasting
wheat
beer
not
my
favorite
from
these
guys
sour
cereal
hurts
its
cause
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
hint
of
orange
aromas
of
fresh
hay
and
some
citrus
taste
begins
with
a
tart
wheat
then
some
yeasty
phenols
and
finishes
with
a
tart
citrus
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
a
good
witbier
but
with
as
many
as
there
are
on
the
market
i
sort
of
wish
nb
brewed
a
more
obscure
style
overall
i
felt
it
underwhelming
for
a
new
belgium
beer
the
color
was
mildly
off
putting
and
the
lemony
tartness
was
just
not
enough
of
a
flavor
to
make
this
beer
very
distinctive
still
its
drinkable
and
will
do
for
a
wheat
beer
clean
decent
mediocre
wheat
beer
with
othing
special
to
recommend
it
im
sure
they
will
sell
hundreds
of
barrels
to
folks
who
dont
really
like
beer
overall
id
have
to
go
over
my
old
notes
but
this
might
be
my
favorite
new
belgium
offering
its
definitely
not
a
traditional
european
wheat
beer
yet
it
has
tons
more
character
than
your
runofthemill
american
wheat
beer
fruity
though
not
crazily
funky
though
not
too
saisoney
and
sour
though
not
brettly
this
beer
fills
an
interestingly
mild
niche
of
drinkable
fruity
wheat
beer
made
in
america
yet
with
its
own
personality
ba
dow
i
can
see
myself
buying
many
sixpacks
of
this
overall
reminds
me
of
a
gose
but
a
bit
sweeter
and
more
wheaty
easy
to
drink
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
a
decent
thirst
slaker
rjt
o
i
really
like
how
theres
some
genuinely
noticeable
tartness
even
to
my
scorchedearth
palate
yet
its
disguised
within
a
wellbalanced
yet
unassuming
wheat
beer
without
the
sour
notes
this
would
be
boooring
thank
the
flying
spaghetti
monster
they
exist
and
help
to
make
this
one
pretty
solid
id
even
buy
it
again
snapshot
from
new
belgium
is
the
first
beer
in
quite
a
while
that
i
liked
and
didnt
like
so
much
all
at
once
appearance
into
the
glass
was
outstanding
good
head
lacing
and
staying
power
taste
was
very
good
citrusy
lemons
and
oranges
i
taste
with
a
good
wheat
mix
mouthfeel
was
slightly
dissapointing
with
too
much
after
taste
the
smell
as
well
was
skunky
to
me
and
thats
after
trying
three
of
them
overall
a
very
good
beer
of
which
ill
happily
have
some
more
very
soon
interesting
but
doesnt
stand
out
in
the
crowded
summer
beer
market
overall
soft
refreshing
amply
effervescent
its
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
the
impending
springtime
notes
pretty
cool
image
on
the
label
of
a
retro
camera
an
instamatic
its
interesting
to
me
how
many
of
these
light
brews
nb
comes
up
with
and
bottles
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
perfectly
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
it
seems
overly
citrusy
and
yet
lacking
enough
of
a
tang
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
an
above
average
example
of
a
wheat
ale
it
was
pretty
true
to
style
and
i
liked
how
fresh
and
juicy
the
orange
aspect
was
and
this
beer
did
a
good
job
at
keeping
the
sweetness
in
check
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
a
little
refreshing
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
when
it
gets
warmer
outside
and
i
could
see
me
taking
it
disc
golfing
but
i
think
i
would
start
to
get
bored
with
flavor
after
a
little
while
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
appearance
i
thought
they
were
both
pretty
nice
and
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
that
spices
didnt
come
through
more
in
the
flavor
i
think
that
would
bring
more
balance
to
the
taste
i
might
buy
this
again
if
its
available
in
the
summer
so
i
can
take
it
disc
golfing
but
i
dont
see
myself
getting
it
for
anything
but
that
reason
i
would
recommend
this
to
people
who
enjoy
the
style
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
solid
wheat
beer
its
for
sure
not
my
favorite
new
belgium
beer
but
its
not
my
least
favorite
either
it
right
in
the
middle
nice
job
guys
keep
up
the
solid
work
poured
a
freshly
dated
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
a
very
underwhelming
brew
with
little
hint
of
orange
or
coriander
or
wheat
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
but
the
taste
is
so
bland
not
sessionable
due
to
lack
of
interest
or
soul
a
complete
swing
and
a
miss
from
a
normally
solid
brewer
o
decent
spring
seasonal
from
new
belgium
12oz
bottle
forgot
what
i
paid
probably
not
much
color
was
very
very
light
yellow
almost
white
extremely
cloudy
with
a
decent
head
smell
was
sort
of
creamy
like
lacto
or
something
flavor
was
a
mild
wheat
with
just
the
faintest
bit
of
tartness
to
it
i
could
see
it
as
a
good
candidate
for
cans
in
the
summertime
good
barbeque
or
lawnmower
beer
taste
is
light
but
quite
palatable
i
get
refreshing
orange
and
spices
among
the
malty
wheat
and
yeasty
attributes
overall
a
perfectly
enjoyable
session
wit
comments
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
regardless
of
the
only
above
average
ratings
many
american
brewery
attempts
at
wheat
beers
i
have
found
have
too
much
carbonation
whether
in
a
bottle
or
on
draft
and
many
also
get
the
color
all
wrong
with
many
times
a
clearer
look
than
what
a
wheat
should
be
and
finally
the
taste
is
spot
on
for
a
wheat
thats
dynamic
and
expects
more
out
of
the
drinker
than
hmm
not
bad
wheats
should
be
compared
to
the
penultimate
weihenstephaner
if
you
want
a
barometer
of
what
a
good
wheat
is
wheats
are
my
go
to
favorite
beer
and
this
may
very
well
be
the
best
america
has
made

overall
great
lawn

beer
appearance
is
a
bit
off
putting
initially
particularly
if
accustomed
to
deutsche
and
pnw
hefes
due
to
the
lack
of
head
no
need
for
the
weizen
glass
on
this
one
next
time
ill
pour
to
a
snifter
aroma
and
flavor
are
well
tied
together
love
the
citrus
gets
a
tad
more
bready
with
a
slight
sour
note
peeking
in
as
it
warms
ill
like
this
one
better
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
but
there
are
a
few
other
wheats
i
would
probably
grab
over
this
a
more
or
less
flavourful
wheat
brew
headier
and
yeastier
than
the
norm
maybe
a
bit
too
fruity
weirdly
but
enjoyable
enough
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
under
different
circumstances
i
e
summer
and
outside
as
a
more
agreeable
alternative
to
the
blue
moons
and
their
ilk
of
the
world
overall
nothing
real
special
but
a
refreshing
session
beer
o
not
as
complex
as
i
would
like
but
a
decent
offering
for
the
style
overall
a
solid
example
of
a
american
wheat
ale
has
all
the
standard
flavors
done
pretty
well
nothing
special
groundbreaking
or
unique
just
a
another
beer
that
would
be
a
fine
summertime
drink
the
aftertaste
is
also
refreshing
and
clean
just
slightly
tart
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
o
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
all
of
the
aromasflavors
are
just
a
touch
too
muted
for
me
sessionable
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
earth
and
yeast
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
grain
and
earth
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
pretty
refreshing
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
mild
all
around
o
great
summer
beer
very
refreshing
would
go
well
drinking
on
the
patio
or
with
grilled
chicken
o
this
wheat
beer
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
something
to
enjoy
in
hot
weather
it
has
a
decent
flavor
but
looks
and
feels
sub
par
for
this
style
not
going
on
my
go
to
list
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
still
better
than
the
popular
beers
atmosphere
is
really
nice
fair
head
persistent
lacing
nose
is
wheaty
and
yeasty
with
a
splash
of
lemon
lightly
hoppy
and
citrusy
with
a
strong
dose
of
wheat
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
poured
into
a
wheat
beer
glass
from
the
bottle
a
murky
yellow
color
with
some
fast
rising
bubbles
and
thick
head
that
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
a
classic
wheat
beer
look
smells
of
citrus
notes
tastes
of
citrus
with
a
unique
sweetnesstartness
at
the
end
this
part
really
makes
the
brew
stand
out
from
the
others
this
will
make
for
a
damn
fine
summer
beer
will
definitely
be
in
heavy
rotation
as
the
temps
rise
this
is
an
awesome
and
one
of
a
kind
beer
by
far
the
best
thing
to
come
out
of
new
belgium
in
a
long
time
solid
stuff
right
here
a
slightly
sour
wheat
unfiltered
and
all
day
drinking
with
ease
its
a
pre
boil
blend
meaning
they
brew
up
a
batch
pitch
lacto
and
the
blend
it
back
in
with
fresh
wort
before
the
boil
and
then
cook
it
up
like
normal
killing
the
lacto
and
then
they
ferment
with
ale
yeast
a
genius
way
to
get
a
tartness
in
this
beer
without
making
a
crazy
sour
a
gateway
beer
for
sure
hazy
blonde
in
color
with
a
big
white
head
nose
is
lemony
and
tart
but
still
round
enough
from
the
ale
yeast
and
clean
for
being
unfiltered
the
taste
is
similarly
dynamic
but
the
tartness
is
very
subtle
enough
to
refresh
and
satiate
me
but
remains
approachable
for
people
who
think
they
dont
like
bacterial
brews
quick
snappy
finish
there
is
a
light
herbal
hop
back
end
i
absolutely
love
this
and
while
i
think
it
may
become
a
year
round
beer
it
seems
to
work
best
for
spring
and
summer
light
and
super
easy
drinking
they
have
nailed
it
and
maybe
coined
a
new
style
in
the
process
huge
props
to
new
belgium
for
this
one
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass
2514
m
light
bodied
and
crushable
o
an
awesome
take
on
the
witbier
take
a
complex
yet
refreshing
style
and
make
it
even
more
refreshing
and
complex
with
souring
bugs
a
true
winner
gonna
crush
my
fair
share
of
these
once
summer
hits
also
note
to
bartenders
this
beer
dont
need
no
stinkin
lemon
overall
a
good
deck
beer
in
warmer
weather
good
use
of
citrus
this
will
be
a
damn
goos
summer
beer
some
inconcsistency
between
bottles
as
some
seem
less
flavorful
than
others
still
a
very
simple
easy
drinking
beer
even
though
this
really
isnt
a
sour
it
may
bring
more
people
into
the
world
of
sour
beers
and
it
seems
that
new
belgium
is
planning
on
making
a
lot
more
sour
beer
in
the
future
i
applaud
nbs
risk
in
releasing
this
as
a
year
round
beer
it
pushes
the
boundaries
of
what
can
be
a
core
beer
this
is
the
evolution
of
craft
beer
from
widmers
iconic
hefe
my
local
wine
and
spirits
just
got
this
in
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
try
pours
a
very
light
hazy
yellow
almost
lemonade
like
first
thoughts
on
taste
is
that
it
does
taste
like
a
light
lemonade
its
got
a
lot
of
citrus
in
the
taste
and
goes
down
smoothly
this
is
a
beer
that
i
may
like
during
a
hot
summer
day
but
it
just
didnt
taste
right
during
winter
right
now
i
recommend
it
but
only
during
summer
overall
this
beer
feels
like
one
that
would
be
good
to
drink
lots
of
in
hot
weather
without
really
thinking
about
it
is
not
too
complex
but
the
tartness
is
an
interesting
twist
ill
pick
it
up
again
once
the
weather
warms
up
o
only
slightly
better
than
sunshine
wheat
not
too
bad
for
a
summer
beer
unfortunately
its
january
poured
on
tap
into
a
pint
glass
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
a
tiny
head
smells
of
sweet
wheat
very
sweet
and
inviting
not
over
the
top
tastes
of
sweet
wheat
but
not
overly
grainy
but
great
beer
i
slight
bodied
but
very
full
in
taste
good
carbonation
and
nice
finish
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
is
a
really
nice
sessionable
beer
good
representation
of
the
wheat
style
imo
it
is
neither
a
crazy
flavor
bomb
nor
extremely
light
it
falls
in
the
middle
7
99
a
6
pk
i
would
def
buy
again
to
have
at
the
house
or
take
to
a
bbq
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
wheat
beer
with
some
character
the
tartness
is
really
faint
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
but
they
werent
trying
to
make
a
berliner
weiss
here
it
wont
change
your
life
but
its
pretty
good
for
a
six
pack
wheat
beer
o
for
this
being
a
six
pack
wheatsour
which
is
something
you
dont
see
to
often
i
think
it
makes
a
great
beer
really
good
everyday
beer
especially
when
summer
hits
not
for
the
super
sour
lover
as
the
tart
on
this
is
light
and
only
present
in
the
finish
but
for
someone
who
enjoys
a
good
heff
but
wants
something
unique
used
to
drink
on
these
wheat
beers
all
the
time
havent
been
able
to
find
them
as
of
recently
a
kind
of
plain
wheat
beer
the
attempts
to
witicize
it
while
not
overly
successful
working
well
for
me
now
as
the
week
has
been
rather
summery
in
denver
and
this
hits
the
spot
as
my
last
brew
here
for
another
year
im
not
a
wheat
beer
fan
but
this
one
is
probably
the
most
popular
one
from
a
craft
brewery
here
in
colorado
i
tried
one
just
to
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
and
its
fine
but
nothing
spectacular
good
when
its
hot
outside
like
most
wheats
overall

a
big
disappointment
i
was
surprised
at
how
overwhemingly
mediocre
this
beer
is
its
a
wheat
beer
sure
but
thats
all
it
is
definition
of
meh
snapshot
is
better
pours
a
strawyellow
with
just
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
when
sipped
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
light
smell
of
lemon
or
citrus
with
some
wheat
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
the
same
and
is
very
smooth
and
pleasant
to
drink
goes
down
easy
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
perfect
carbonation
as
well
this
is
a
great
brew
for
the
spring
and
summer
months
very
pleased
with
this
one
i
like
my
wheat
beers
a
little
sweeter
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
light
sour
finish
but
some
will
enjoy
that

this
is
a
nice
brew
it
is
fairly

packs
some
great
flavor
it
is
really
nothing
too
special
bombers
being
unloaded
at
the
market

lets
give
it

aroma
that
is
almost
floral
pours
int
a
sapp
with
a
three
finger
head
and
a
cloudy
straw
color
on
the
taste
there
is
a
nice
feint
bitterness
right
on
the
start
that
then
gives
way
to
more
floral
spicy
fruit
flavor
with
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
the
spices
and
fruit
then
fade
away
and
are
replaced
by
a
broad
flat
bitterness
that
is
balanced
with
the
malt
then
it
too
fades
quickly
leaving
a
clean
finish
very
refreshing
and
very
light
and
crisp
for
a
wheat
beer
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
golden
only
a
small
white
fizzy
head
the
beer
smells
fresh
and
mainly
of
light
lemony
notes
with
cracker
and
a
hint
of
coriander
mello
sweetness
with
a
dry
and
grassy
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
mediumhigh
carbonation
a
very
good
beer
and
a
nice
take
on
the
style
o
not
bad
at
all
for
a
pale
wheat
complex
and
refreshing
o
good
for
a
hot
day
but
not
overwhelming
flavors
this
beer
is
solid
and
i
wasnt
expecting
that
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
and
subdued
spice
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slight
citrus
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
pretty
subdued
all
around
certainly
an
easy
drinking
casual
beer
but
it
does
have
some
pleasant
subtle
complexities
if
the
time
is
taken
to
appreciate
them
a
lightersideofmedium
body
with
an
effervescence
that
bursts
forth
at
the
start
stays
noticeable
and
fades
unwillingly
fairly
astringent
throughout
i
must
say
im
not
a
big
fan
of
filtered
wheatstone
i
miss
the
yeastiness
and
the
appearance
a
decent
beer
overall
but
not
worth
searching
for
this
is
blue
moon
im
drinking
blue
moon
right
now
i
pulled
one
of
my
roommates
blue
moons
out
of
the
fridge
just
to
compare
sunshine
wheat
tastes
identical
to
blue
moon
interestingly
enough
blue
moon
has
a
78
rating
and
this
beer
has
a
79
maybe
bas
are
less
biased
against
the
big
brewers
than
they
think
so
yeah
back
to
the
beer
if
youve
had
blue
moon
youve
had
this
big
orange
and
coriander
over
a
light
body
with
noticeable
adjuncts
the
main
difference
is
that
blue
moon
pours
whiter
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
tight
head
and
lots
of
lacing
nose
is
light
and
bready
with
a
little
lemon
citrus
flavor
of
white
bread
with
lemon
citrus
and
some
pepper
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
overall
good
beer
refreshing
easy
to
drink
d
enjoyable
when
i
first
started
enjoying
beer
i
recall
this
being
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
decent
but
not
something
to
seek
out
o
a
fairly
unexciting
and
rather
average
wheat
ale
low
c
tastes
clean
if
unexceptional
the
lemon
tapers
to
a
touch
of
banana
and
clove
its
a
wheat
beer
what
do
you
expect
not
the
most
exciting
expression
of
the
style
but
ive
certainly
had
much
worse
o
this
is
my
kind
of
light
beer
the
spiciness
has
a
great
flavor
and
it
is
tangy
and
refreshing
the
beer
is
smooth
and
mellow
and
easy
drinking
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
clear
light
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
that
retains
well
there
are
numerous
tiny
bubbles
visible
in
the
beer
there
are
aromas
of
orange
and
coriander
i
also
get
some
light
malt
in
the
nose
the
flavors
are
mostly
of
the
malt
with
support
from
orange
and
coriander
the
body
is
medium
with
a
nice
soft
mouthfeel
theres
enough
carbonation
to
make
this
beer
refreshing
this
is
an
average
yet
refreshing
beer
final
thoughts
new
belgium
sunshine
wheat
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
had
that
i
truly
enjoyed
drinking
now
a
few
years
later
and
having
tried
hundreds
of
different
beers
it
comes
off
as
rather
bland
and
unremarkable
id
recommend
it
for
those
just
getting
into
craft
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
no
this
beer
didnt
grow
on
me
in
fact
it
was
the
opposite
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
good
summer
brew
though
overall
above
average
but
not
spectacular
goes
down
easy
overall
a
ok
wheat
style
beer
mild
flavor
drinkable
but
nothing
wow
rjt
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
before
dec
23
2012
this
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
mid
sized
white
head
which
leaves
a
light
lacing
the
smell
is
light
and
of
lemon
spice
wheat
the
feel
is
medium
light
mid
carbonination
the
taste
is
okay
a
little
light
mild
bitterness
lemon
lemon
peels
spices
a
good
gateway
craft
beer
but
i
probably
wont
find
myself
drinking
it
again
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
highly
recommended
overall
simply
a
clean
easytosession
summer
wheat
beer
i
have
no
problems
giving
this
one
high
marks
hardly
any
faults
pours
out
to
a
creamy
but
thin
white
head
and
hazy
pale
yellow
color
aroma
is
strong
coriander
and
citrus
with
some
grainy
wheat
blended
in
flavor
corresponds
to
aroma
with
orange
pepper
lemon
and
dry
wheat
and
biscuity
new
belgium
malt
flavors
no
discernible
hop
character
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
hope
to
have
more
of
this
summer
overall
new
belgium
got
rid
of
mothership
wit
and
kept
this
shit
seriously
overall
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
is
perfect
for
drinking
all
day
and
if
it
was
a
little
lower
in
alcohol
content
would
make
a
perfect
session
beer
if
based
on
the
tasting
experience
alone
o
a
pleasant
beer
the
subdued
nature
of
the
spice
is
just
right
i
like
the
added
complexity
without
getting
the
impression
of
chewing
on
a
mouthful
of
coriander
a
nice
wheat
beer
id
drink
another
bottle
for
sure
overall
drinkability
a
nice
combination
that
i
wish
were
a
bit
more
forceful
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
served
best
cold
on
a
warm
day
not
real
impressed
with
this
one
super
light
cloudy
whiteish
yellow
pale
color
with
a
short
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
smells
lemony
and
yeasty
and
the
flavor
matches
extraordinarily
light
on
the
tongue
in
the
mouth
similar
in
feel
to
their
mothership
wit
lots
of
carbonation
low
abv
makes
it
sessionable
but
its
got
a
funky
rindy
sort
of
aftertaste
that
makes
it
funny
in
the
stomach
after
a
few
not
new
belgiums
best
product
but
i
suppose
it
satisfies
those
looking
for
a
shocktop
style
beer
from
a
craft
operation
moutfeel
is
extremely
thin
and
carbonated
a
bit
too
watery
overall
its
easy
drinking
with
enough
complexity
to
make
it
memorable
but
not
worldclass
nothing
really
special
slightly
decent
brew
light
pale
straw
in

semi
hazy
light
fluffy
two

head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
but
only
leaves
behind

of

maybe
a
slight
hint
of
nutmeg
once
allowed
to

made
up
of
lemon

and
wheat

with
a

is
crisp
clean
and
buoyantly

memorable
for
being
one
of
the
most
lemony
fresh
pale
wheat
ales
ive
ever
had
and
for
a
great
mouthfeel
o
this
is
just
an
okay
beer
i
could
see
me
drinking
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
other
than
that
it
is
not
anything
special
reviewed
on
02232011

overall
it
has
some
nice
flavors
and
aromas
but
its
not
my
favorite
and
i
may
or
may
not
come
back
to
this
one
the
pepperiness
is
something
im
not
familiar
with
but
thats
just
me
give
this
one
a
try
though
as
its
definitely
worth
trying
othis
is
a
decent
wheat
beer
very
reasonably
priced
and
i
would
drink
this
over
a
boulevard
wheat
any
day
d
an
easy
drinker
but
not
one
is
have
again
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
it
has
some
flavor
to
make
it
appealing
however
with
so
many
other
more
complex
beers
out
there
it
does
come
off
as
quite
onesided
all
in
all
the
good
points
cancel
out
the
bad
points
and
you
get
a
decent
wheat
ale
o
overall
this
beer
is
bland
o
easy
drinking
good
lawnmower
beer
its
very
light
but
it
is
refreshing
and
somewhat
complex
overall
too
much
of
a
macro
light
for
me
drinkable
none
the
less
and
not
as
watery
as
a
macro
lager
beer
is
light
in
body
and
sweet
on
the
front
with
a
mild
grainy
finish
overall
it
is
an
interesting
beer
but
not
a
favorite
of
mine
i
like
it
but
i
dont
know
how
much
of
it
i
would
buy
midpalate
is
a
little
flowery
fruity
mild
yeast
overall
just
a
decent
beer
nothing
special
overall
i
agree
with
the
consensus
that
this
is
largely
forgettable
there
is
nothing
to
really
complain
about
but
there
is
just
not
a
lot
of
flavor
to
maintain
my
interest
this
is
a
pleasant
sipping
beer
but
i
do
wish
the
flavor
was
stronger
sunshine
wheat
would
be
good
to
enjoy
in
100degree
heat
but
thats
about
the
only
time
id
reach
for
one
very
refreshing
and
very
average
good
beer
new
belgium
sunshine
wheat
if
you
have
read
some
of
my
reviews
you
know
i
dedicate
the
summer
to
celebration
of
wheat
beers
the
new
belgium
sunshine
wheat
is
a
filtered
wheat
beer
light
in
color
and
fragrance
it
has
a
very
clean
taste
without
the
yeast
common
to
unfiltered
wheat
beers
given
the
added
spices
it
has
a
flavor
that
puts
is
somewhere
between
my
standard
odell
easy
street
and
the
true
belgian
whitbeer
such
as
a
hoegaarden
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
but
i
in
general
prefer
unfiltered
brews
during
the
all
to
short
wheat
beer
season
overalldrinkability
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
beer
for
the
summer
but
a
welcomed
change
of
pace
overallnew
belgium
seems
to
be
hit
or
miss
with
me
i
love
them
or
hate
them
this
one
is
closer
to
the
hate
list
when
the
summer
heat
calls
for
setting
aside
the
sipping
beers
and
picking
up
a
drinking
beer
this
one
will
prove
worthy
pours
a
perfect
length
two
finger
head
that
makes
it
right
to
the
top
of
my
wheat
glass
the
head
is
completely
white
with
about
half
small
bubbles
and
half
big
bubbles
kinda
creamy
looking
but
its
not
hanging
around
very
long
pretty
good
lacing
though
the
body
is
see
through
in
some
areas
and
cloudy
in
other
but
overall
its
a
lot
lighter
in
color
than
it
should
be
and
its
not
as
cloudy
as
it
should
be
the
body
is
yellow
pretty
much
looks
like
a
lager
other
than
some
of
the
cloudiness
way
too
much
carbonation
here
as
well
the
only
reason
this
beer
is
getting
a
3
5
is
because
of
the
good
lacing
and
thats
really
a
generous
rating
it
looks
like
a
lager
the
smell
on
this
beer
is
good
though
it
sort
of
smell
like
a
hoegaarden
the
spices
are
the
most
prominent
thing
not
too
much
fruit
but
thats
sometimes
a
good
thing
i
am
picking
up
some
small
scents
of
fruit
and
a
tiny
bit
of
light
malt
but
for
the
most
part
its
all
spice
the
smell
isnt
very
potent
and
there
isnt
really
much
too
it
but
its
for
sure
better
than
the
appearance
this
beer
really
isnt
impressing
me
at
all
in
any
areas
the
taste
is
no
different
i
get
a
little
spice
and
maybe
some
lemon
or
possibly
orange
on
the
taste
but
thats
about
it
some
maltyness
is
present
and
a
touch
of
wheat
but
its
way
too
small
for
this
to
be
considered
a
quality
beer
frankly
its
just
a
little
watery
maybe
this
beer
deserves
better
than
a
3
on
taste
but
i
think
its
closer
to
a
3
than
it
is
to
a
3
5
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that
the
appearance
was
close
to
a
3
but
the
lacing
bailed
it
out
and
the
smell
was
slightly
better
than
the
look
so
that
bailed
it
out
i
cant
keep
cutting
this
beer
more
breaks
this
maybe
could
get
a
3
5
but
it
really
doesnt
deserve
it
nothing
about
this
is
above
average
mouthfeel
is
the
same
story
its
close
to
being
a
3
5
but
not
quite
there
there
is
only
a
tiny
tiny
bit
of
wheat
and
thats
not
going
to
fly
in
a
wheat
beer
especially
for
the
mouthfeel
other
than
the
wheat
its
just
way
too
light
without
any
wheat
its
obviously
going
to
be
light
and
it
is
i
know
wheat
beers
are
a
lighter
style
but
there
really
isnt
much
to
this
at
all
carbonation
is
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
overall
not
a
great
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
but
only
because
its
so
damn
light
its
doesnt
taste
amazing
or
anything
overall
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
being
one
tiny
step
above
a
blue
moon
seasonal
the
blue
moon
spring
ale
and
summer
ale
were
pretty
crappy
and
this
is
just
a
little
bit
better
than
those
two
the
blue
moon
standard
the
belgian
white
was
better
than
this
beer
so
overall
i
can
drink
it
i
wont
mind
drinking
it
its
a
spiced
beer
so
even
though
its
bad
its
not
terrible
but
its
just
not
doing
it
for
me
in
really
any
areas
average
beer
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
with
some
coriander
and
some
orange
peel
notes
smells
like
a
witbier
that
is
heavy
on
the
coriander
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
coriander
is
the
predominant
flavor
although
there
is
a
little
bit
of
orange
and
other
fruit
as
well
there
is
some
light
pepper
notes
in
the
flavor
also
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
id
drink
this
if
someone
handed
it
to
me
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
one
overall
drinkability
balanced
at
best
boring
at
worst
not
a
must
have
but
not
bad
overall
when
it
comes
down
to
it
new
belgian
makes
a
beer
to
accommodate
each
and
every
style
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
will
say
it
has
a
great
drinkability
but
i
stopped
with
this
one
and
switched
over
to
the
zubrowka
bison
grass
vodka
o
american
wheat
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
by
a
stretch
but
this
one
was
alright
i
would
drink
again
for
the
right
price
on
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
and
the
light
body
made
it
easy
to
go
down
and
ask
for
another
if
it
came
down
to
it
though
i
would
take
a
magic
hat
9
over
another
one
of
these
any
day
good
per
style
not
my
favorite
style
hard
to
judge
you
cant
really
bash
on
this
beer
for
anything
it
is
a
sessionable
wheat
great
for
summer
the
canning
helps
carbonation
some
and
is
quite
active
on
the
palate
that
baby
powder
taste
i
sensed
is
a
bit
odd
but
doesnt
exactly
hurt
this
beer
any
d
the
drink
is
nice
overall
nb
makes
great
beers
im
always
excited
when
their
seasonals
come
out
when
i
took
the
time
to
pick
the
beer
apart
it
seems
like
it
falls
flat
but
really
its
a
great
spring
session
beer
hopefully
the
spice
on
this
wheat
wont
disappoint
you
the
flavor
was
much
more
of
the
same
with
a
very
bright
and
appropriate
for
summer
taste
there
was
a
decent
hint
of
orange
rind
and
lemon
in
the
back
with
a
nice
rounded
wheat
flavor
nothing
shocking
or
extraordinary
here
though
the
feel
was
very
light
and
highly
carbonated
crisp
and
clean
with
little
in
the
way
of
aftertaste
nice
beverage
for
a
hot
day
this
ties
in
here
as
well
as
it
was
just
very
light
with
low
abv
and
just
that
slightest
bit
of
citrus
to
make
it
pop
it
could
have
easily
been
something
that
you
have
multiples
of
for
sure
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
d
one
and
done
if
u
dont
believe
me
put
one
in
a
pick
6
and
try
it
not
a
bad
drinker
but
nothing
very
tasty
d
very
very
drinkable
this
would
be
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
south
texas
summer
day
overall
b
overall
nice
brew
and
a
nice
drinkable
change
of
pace
from
the
heavy
over
the
top
rich
brews
that
often
dominate
the
colder
winter
months
though
this
is
an
odd
cross
between
a
wit
and
an
american
wheat
would
be
very
curious
to
see
how
this
brew
tastes
unfiltered
might
take
the
edge
off
the
slightly
astringent
finish
either
way
i
am
happy
i
tried
it
d
only
drinkable
if
i
forget
about
enjoying
myself
and
go
directly
to
quenching
a
thirst
no
thank
you
d
this
is
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
a
blue
moon
fan
for
transition
to
micros
especially
during
a
hot
august
afternoon
per
the
bottle
an
american
wheat
with
belgian
witbier
leanings
i
might
have
enjoyed
the
beer
had
it
leaned
more
in
that
direction
the
noted
orange
peel
and
coriander
were
there
but
just
barely
the
overall
impression
was
a
fairly
insipid
american
pale
wheat
with
just
a
little
spice
not
enought
to
enliven
it
and
it
was
almost
more
of
a
distraction
there
seems
to
be
no
real
dearth
of
summer
style
beers
in
winter
hmm
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
cardamom
a
lot
of
cracked
black
pepper
and
white
bread
the
taste
does
not
deviate
from
this
prescribed
path
though
a
slight
mild
sour
crick
wanders
through
along
the
base
of
the
mountain
imagery
yeah
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
very
light
carbonation
and
a
smooth
nearly
watery
feel
overall
a
nice
bit
o
apwa
though
i
could
see
some
not
appreciating
the
pepper
as
i
do
d
an
easy
to
drink
wheat
beer
d
decent
enough
for
a
summer
time
lawn
mower
beer
but
nothing
i
would
really
want
alot
of
or
that
often
not
one
of
new
belgiums
best
efforts
yikes
did
i
drink
this
past
its
prime
i
guess
i
have
to
try
it
again
when
it
is
more
in
season
because
as
is
yuck
pours
a
light
yellow
color
white
head
and
not
much
lacing
the
nose
is
really
quite
plain
there
are
a
few
light
notes
of
orange
and
lemon
maybe
a
tad
bit
of
spice
the
taste
is
slight
malt
with
a
bit
of
sugar
light
orange
character
feel
is
light
and
somewhat
refreshing
another
very
plain
offering
out
of
them
quite
disappointing
dr
very
refreshing
could
have
a
lot
of
these
on
a
hot
day
its
actually
very
good
im
impressed
with
it
this
would
probably
go
very
well
for
a
person
who
likes
the
flavors
of
a
wit
without
all
the
sweetness
drinkability
this
is
a
good
summer
time
beer
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
definitely
refreshing
it
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
a
pleasant
sweet
aftertaste
final
notes
i
like
a
lot
of
the
new
belgium
beers
but
this
one
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
a
little
more
flavor
than
a
macro
but
its
rather
bland
and
unbalanced
overall
its
still
crisp
and
refreshing
but
i
cant
deal
with
the
toucan
sam
after
taste
overall
i
like
the
taste
but
downgraded
on
the
smell
and
only
soso
on
the
appearance
good
start
when
youre
ready
to
move
up
theres
better
but
this
is
good
d
very
drinkable
as
all
the
flavors
are
there
and
its
not
a
huge
abv
beer
highly
drinkable
and
not
at
all
overbearing
would
be
excellent
for
a
day
of
fishin
on
the
lake
i
see
from
other
reviews
that
cans
are
available
that
would
be
excellent
for
this
brew
since
many
lakes
have
a
no
glass
containers
rule
quite
drinkable
and
delicious
on
a
warm
day
cheers
di
am
not
impressed
with
this
offering
from
nb
its
looking
more
like
a
drain
pour
the
more
i
drink
this
it
was
a
gift
though
and
i
do
not
want
to
offend
gag
i
think
it
fits
the
bill
just
right
if
you
want
a
pale
wheat
ale
poured
into
pint
glass
from
a
12
oz
can
i
am
personally
very
excited
to
see
so
many
colorado
brewers
putting
beers
like
this
into
cans
perfect
for
the
park
this
one
was
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
light
wheat
lemon
and
citrus
lots
of
lemony
flavors
here
along
with
wheat
and
a
hint
of
hops
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
one
to
drink
during
the
upcoming
hot
summer
days
really
not
bad
at
all
recommended
to
buy
this
by
the
six
pack
or
more
slainte
d
out
of
a
can
does
seem
somewhat
different
although
i
cant
figure
out
why
i
would
prefer
this
beer
in
this
medium
md
mouthfeel
is
watery
its
as
drinkable
as
a
weak
lager
d
very
drinkable
smooth
with
a
bit
sharpness
but
definitely
light
enough
to
drink
down
quick
pretty
lacking
overall
the
body
was
not
watery
as
i
expected
after
looking
at
it
in
fact
it
had
quite
a
nice
coating
feel
carbonation
was
maybe
a
little
stiffer
than
i
would
have
liked
but
all
in
all
it
was
very
well
done
this
is
no
heavyweight
but
itd
be
incredibly
easy
to
pound
several
of
them
on
a
sunny
day
outside
d
very
drinkable
smooth
light
and
not
actively
bad
by
any
means
i
dont
dislike
this
beer
so
much
as
i
am
just
disappointed
it
lacks
the
punch
that
i
expected
from
a
nb
beer
good
enough
but
just
doesnt
have
anything
exciting
about
it
good
drinkability
a
fine
offering
from
new
belgium
d
this
beer
is
palatable
and
tastes
decent
but
lacks
character
the
taste
was
quite
a
surprise
what
seemed
to
be
a
neglected
beer
from
nb
and
looked
quite
average
at
first
really
shocked
my
tastebuds
by
far
the
fruitiest
wheat
beer
ive
had
to
date
strong
blueberry
notes
hit
the
tastebuds
immediately
with
banana
and
orange
notes
trailing
hardly
any
bitterness
with
a
real
creamy
smooth
texture
one
of
the
more
sessionalable
wheat
beers
out
there
the
beer
was
exceedingly
crisp
and
smooth
on
the
palate
with
a
good
balance
of
flavours
the
spice
was
light
on
the
tongue
and
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
it
finished
cleanly
a
rather
nice
wheat
ale
that
is
entirely
sessionable

and
it
would
be
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
md
creamy

this

didnt

great
beer
for

or
whenever
d
i
usually
prefer
a
lighter
bodied
wheat
beer
the
aroma
is
nice
enough
but
the
flavor
doesnt
really
deliver
all
that
it
promises
however
still
decent
enough
d
overall
a
solid
session
beer
that
goes
down
easy
while
delivering
some
good
flavors
this
one
will
always
had
a
special
place
for
me
since
it
was
one
of
the
gateway
beers
that
really
turned
me
onto
craft
beers
at
the
time
it
blew
away
the
bmcs
that
i
was
drinking
and
became
my
regular
sixer
in
my
fridge
after
i
discovered
ba
i
moved
on
to
other
beers
and
flavors
ive
moved
past
this
one
but
still
get
the
occasional
sixer
and
enjoy
the
old
days
rotation
avail
here
occasional
memory
lane
sixer
plus
ontap
when
in
colorado
for
trips
d
you
probably
could
drink
these
all
night
long
light
abv
and
light
flavor
but
why
i
pass
on
this
brew
and
deem
it
my
worst
new
belgium
experience
yet
i
have
not
had
this
bad
of
an
experience
since
i
watched
that
ronald
reagan
film
notes
a
better
than
average
american
pale
wheat
if
they
bumped
up
the
wheatbarley
ratio
it
might
qualify
as
a
kristalweizen
even
as
it
stands
though
it
fulfills
its
function
admirably
a
little
better
than
your
run
of
the
mill
wheat
beer
has
a
nice
subtle
citrus
scent
and
taste
to
accent
the
wheat
also
some
spice
to
add
character
the
bottle
says
corriander
and
ill
take
their
word
for
it
pretty
thin
feeling
this
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
for
warmer
temperatures
this
is
an
averaga
wheat
beer
with
low
flavor
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
drinkability
is
such
i
would
not
try
again
glad
i
tired
it
but
but
their
are
more
falvorful
wheat
beers
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
good
bite
of
carbonation
considering
its
lower
abv
it
something
you
can
knock
back
all
day
it
also
wont
do
a
number
on
your
taste
buds
if
you
feel
like
going
on
to
something
bigger
bolder
for
me
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
i
was
born
raised
in
the
fort
so
it
reminds
me
home
mouthfeeldrinkability
light
bodied
and
kind
of
thin
would
be
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
thats
about
it
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
again
drinkability
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
its
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
light
wheat
beer
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
like
the
spice
flavor
that
this
beer
has
to
offer
washed
out
yellow
pee
color
almost
clear
with
a
big
white
head
resting
on
top
and
displaying
good
retention
very
spiced
aroma
mostly
coriandor
dominates
with
some
orange
peel
in
the
taste
there
are
some
bits
of
orange
but
it
is
spice
oriented
very
little
maltiness
in
the
body
light
bodied
its
an
okay
wheat
beer
but
a
little
more
maltiness
would
add
another
layer
of
goodness
to
this
beer
still
its
solid
drinking
on
a
warm
day
overall
a
very
drinkable
summer
beer
but
not
something
i
would
go
to
regularly
i
think
this
one
would
just
get
the
nod
over
sd
first
i
should
comment
that
summertime
wheats
arent
my
personal
favorites
but
the
weather
called
for
something
in
this
style
that
i
had
never
tried
it
did
not
specifically
dissappoint
and
it
ment
the
general
need
of
the
drinkability
expectation
of
this
beer
it
did
however
possess
a
bit
more
body
than
i
had
expected
the
typical
wit
beer
spices
were
present
but
not
overpowering
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
good
amount
of
head
nice
lacing
as
it
was
drank
d
i
had
no
problems
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
would
want
a
beer
with
more
flavour
in
the
future
pretty
much
middle
of
the
road
for
its
style
its
a
bit
thin
and
watery
its
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
or
a
hot
day
by
the
lake
beer
but
has
a
wierd
metallic
aftertaste
it
makes
me
want
to
drink
from
the
bottle
too
i
feel
undewhelmed
drinking
it
from
a
pint
glass
d
easy
drinker
one
of
the
easiest
from
new
belgium
this
beer
was
somewhat
of
an
obsession
of
mine
when
i
first
got
into
craft
beer
and
revisiting
it
has
made
me
realize
its
not
as
good
as
i
used
to
think
it
was
but
it
still
is
a
tasty
beer
excellent
gatewaytransition
beer
glad
to
have
revisited
an
old
friend
drinkability
suffers
greatly
from
the
high
carbonation
and
any
real
lack
of
flavor
that
exists
so
much
so
that
i
could
not
finish
it
d
this
is
an
exceptional
lawnmower
beer
theres
not
much
going
on
here
but
it
would
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
drink
straight
out
of
the
bottle
at
a
bbq
since
it
lacks
flavor
and
aroma
my
overall
score
may
not
reflect
this
but
sunshine
is
my
favorite
american
filtered
wheat
beer
i
cant
quite
pinpoint
what
exactly
it
is
that
makes
this
beer
stand
out
it
definately
has
a
very
distinct
flavor
i
beleive
it
is
spiced
similarly
to
other
wheats
so
perhaps
it
is
the
particular
strand
of
wheat
malts
or
hops
they
use
give
it
a
try
its
definately
a
slightly
different
take
on
the
filtered
wheat
overall
great
stuff
drink
this
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
perfect
for
a
barbecue
beer
poured
straw
yellow
with
a
pretty
good
white
head
nose
is
wheat
malt
all
the
way
taste
is
wheat
malt
lemongrass
and
a
hint
of
coriander
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
lively
on
the
palate
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
nice
100
degree
day
here
is
phoenix
d
definite
sessionability
a
nice
summer
beer
good
when
grilling
or
enjoying
the
outdoors
this
guy
is
very
refreshing
and
a
great
choice
for
a
summertime
session
i
am
more
of
a
fan
of
cloudier
beers
ones
with
more
flavor
than
this
overall
i
was
disappointed
by
new
belgiums
showing
on
this
beer
d
oh
yes
nothing
like
putting
back
a
bunch
of
these
on
a
summer
day
by
a
pool
crisp
refreshing
and
easily
approachable
by
novice
and
expert
alike
im
not
a
big
fan
of
nb
i
hate
fat
tire
for
instance
this
beer
is
much
better
but
i
suspect
i
just
like
their
take
on
this
style
better
than
the
amber
ale
didnt
get
to
see
the
beer
too
well
as
i
drank
it
from
the
bottle
spicy
fresh
aroma
enticing
very
fresh
same
spicy
flowery
taste
coriander
some
malts
fizzy
mouthfeel
very
tasty
very
similar
taste
to
a
belgian
ale
good
job
new
belgium
overall
this
was
just
an
okay
brew
for
me
i
guess
after
trying
several
im
just
not
real
fond
of
the
american
wheat
beer
md
the
feel
is
light
and
airy
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
on
hot
summer
afternoons
i
am
excited
for
the
summertime
to
enjoy
this
brew
more
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
a
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
coriander
tangy
wheat
and
oranges
but
it
is
all
very
faint
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
stronger
and
with
the
addition
of
the
same
generic
caramel
maltiness
that
can
be
found
in
most
new
belgium
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
at
best
i
could
drink
it
again
if
someone
else
bought
it
for
me
cheers
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
have
not
had
this
beer
in
some
years
but
its
still
as
good
i
remembered
for
what
it
is
and
tries
to
be
this
beer
is
impressive
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
like
wheat
beers
overall
its
a
solid
wheat
beer
although
i
have
had
better
easily
sessionable
had
this
at
the
classic
brew
in
c
c
tx
i
really
like
it
if
i
wasnt
such
a
hop
lover
ide
go
and
get
me
a
sixer
clear
bright
yellow
pour
with
a
light
white
head
wheaty
grassy
aroma
with
crystal
malt
and
some
metal
the
taste
is
very
light
lemony
with
the
slight
flavor
of
grass
and
wheat
light
mouthfeel
compliments
the
taste
very
well
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
a
longtime
favorite
of
many
colorado
folks
i
tried
this
one
ontap
in
durango
my
glass
was
delivered
to
me
a
bright
yellow
color
with
almost
no
head
perhaps
the
pour
and
very
little
lacing
consequently
the
aroma
was
crisp
lemony
hops
and
dry
grains
with
lots
of
wheat
presence
the
flavors
were
at
first
lemony
and
wheatlike
but
it
quickly
paled
i
just
never
got
much
more
the
body
was
watery
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
average
not
unpleasant
just
forgettable
as
with
many
popular
beers
i
think
people
like
it
because
its
easy
to
drink
thus
easy
to
get
fed
up
on
but
really
i
consider
it
one
of
the
weakest
beers
this
brewery
produces
nothing
crazy
but
very
drinkable
there
isnt
very
much
wheat
at
all
in
this
socalled
wheat
id
certify
this
as
a
lackluster
brew
from
new
belgium
d
very
refreshing
not
filling
at
all
flavors
are
fairly
balanced
plenty
of
carbonation
mouth
feel
was
somewhat
over
carbonated
this
beer
has
an
overall
great
drink
ability
nice
sweet
light
flavors
this
beer
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
this
is
a
pale
yellow
brown
beer
with
a
fizzy
white
head
has
a
very
bland
smell
to
it
that
is
nothing
like
it
tastes
a
very
fruity
high
in
esters
that
remind
me
of
a
breakfast
fruit
bar
with
no
real
bitterness
to
speak
of
it
is
crisp
clean
and
something
you
could
drink
for
its
refreshing
character
d
spices
are
too
overpowering
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night

this
one
was
a
little
disappointing
as
far
as
new
belgium
brews
go
while
its
not
bad
there
are
at
least
a
handful
of
other
wheat
beers
that
id
rather
have
than
this
one
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
that
really
sets
it
apart
from
others
in
the
same
family
perhaps
its
better
on
tap
but
ill
stick
to
some
of
the
other
new
belgium
brews
in
the
future
nice
wheat
flavor
this
one
was
real
clear
i
wish
that
this
one
was
unfiltered
and
a
tuch
sweeter
this
is
refreshing
it
has
a
bit
of
a
citrus
twist
a
beer
purfict
for
summer
this
one
is
avrage
for
a
wheat
but
i
could
drink
it
agan
if
it
ever
crossed
my
path
drinkable
but
not
a
favorite
pours
a
hazy
golden
hue
with
an
average
puffy
white
head
that
falls
to
a
simple
disk
of
foam
floating
atop
the
beer
smell
is
very
nice
lemon
zest
apricot
orange
juice
grass
green
apple
some
white
grape
and
some
tropical
hints
of
pineapple
taste
begins
nice
and
smooth
sweet
oranges
and
a
touch
of
sour
apple
then
a
transition
into
whole
wheaty
goodness
finishes
like
you
just
ate
whole
wheat
exhale
and
you
taste
what
it
tastes
like
to
chew
on
a
straw
of
wheat
the
mouthfeel
is
vibrant
and
carbonated
this
isnt
a
complex
beer
there
is
not
much
thinking
with
that
said
its
a
solid
beer
more
than
worthy
of
a
summer
afternoon
on
the
back
porch
drinkability
was
very
good
had
on
tap
at
the
dundee
dell
in
omaha
ne
has
a
nice
straw
appearance
hazy
and
dense
the
aroma
is
full
of
fruit
especially
orange
and
lemon
with
little
of
the
expected
banana
this
was
a
nice
surprise
and
it
tasted
quite
citrusy
but
not
as
overpoweringly
so
as
other
wheat
beers
i
tried
during
the
same
session
had
a
decent
hoppy
bitterness
and
fizz
that
added
a
nice
touch
at
the
end
with
a
rather
thick
texture
that
made
the
beer
last
a
while
definitely
worth
a
try
d
good
session
beer
not
particularly
exciting
but
a
good
summer
quencher
its
pretty
light
but
i
enjoyed
it
its
definitely
good
to
go
as
a
summer
afternoon
sessioner
a
good
average
wheat
beer
from
the
people
at
new
belgium
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
is
of
wheat
malt
sand
soem
swet
fruits
the
flavor
structure
consists
of
mostly
wheat
as
well
a
crisp
refreshing
body
add
to
the
drinkability
goes
well
with
an
orange
very
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
wheat
but
worth
having
another
very
pale
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
going
on
a
big
large
bubbled
white
head
and
fair
lace
the
aroma
is
a
decent
typical
wheat
and
light
citrus
the
flavor
is
bready
light
and
effervescent
not
bad
but
nothing
memorable
easy
drinking
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
going
out
of
your
way
for
this
one
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
to
begin
with
but
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
very
bold
attempt
at
it
anyway
this
is
quite
a
quenching
drink
a
must
for
the
summer
d
this
is
a
really
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
a
nice
session
brew
a
very
interesting
american
wheat
i
thought
pours
a
very
pale
light
beer
like
yellow
in
a
weizen
glass
with
a
nice
head
however
smell
is
unique
and
like
a
lemony
cerealish
smell
some
sweetness
but
not
sickly
sweet
however
and
i
didnt
get
any
notes
of
coriander
or
orange
peel
somehow
this
feels
very
viscous
in
the
mouth
amazingly
full
body
and
mouthfeel
for
an
american
wheat
yet
is
crisp
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
nice
light
wheaty
finish
although
the
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
light
and
muted
side
this
is
still
very
nice
refreshing
bright
wheat
beer
that
i
can
see
enjoying
again
for
sure
d
notes
overall
i
am
actually
fairly
impressed
with
this
brew
as
i
am
normally
not
a
pale
wheat
beer
lover
this
isnt
something
i
would
seek
out
regularly
but
rating
it
for
style
i
would
say
it
is
very
solid
its
well
balanced
nothing
is
overdone
plenty
of
flavor
and
its
very
refreshing
for
the
style
a
definite
winner
for
a
session
wheat
beer
this
would
be
a
good
choice
to
give
a
bmc
drinker
and
introduce
himher
to
the
world
of
craft
beer
despite
my
slight
disappointment
in
the
flavoring
i
found
this
to
be
an
extremely
pleasant
and
drinkable
if
unremarkable
beer
i
could
have
had
a
second
quite
easily
all
and
all
is
a
good
choice
probably
not
one
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
overall
drinkable
and
okay
as
a
gateway
beer
but
underwhelming
refreshing
is
the
name
of
the
game
for
one
of
the
standards
of
excellence
from
new
belgium
golden
in
color
with
a
bright
white
head
smells
of
citrus
and
spice
evoke
an
image
of
taste
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
sunny
day
or
picnic
out
on
the
poudre
river
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
know
i
goes
down
so
easy
almost
too
easy
if
thats
really
possible
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
good
representation
of
style
but
leans
toward
being
a
witbier
this
one
is
definitely
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
if
you
want
something
light
but
it
might
not
necessarily
be
my
first
choice
as
for
drinkability
i
will
definitely
keep
a
few
of
these
on
hand
for
those
times
when
dark
beer
will
seem
too
heavy
when
the
weather
is
hot
definitely
worth
a
try
on
this
one
drinkability
another
of
new
belgiums
highly
drinkable
lighter
styles
d
refreshing
if
a
little
boring
drinkability
nice
on
a
hot
summers
day
after
mowing
though
nothing
too
sensational
seems
to
be
new
belgiums
attempt
at
kristall
weizen
a
good
beer
for
a
good
price
drinkability
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
definitely
thirst
quenching
the
color
of
this
beer
definitely
follows
the
name
as
it
is
a
bright
clear
golden
color
the
head
was
short
and
white
the
smell
was
faint
wheat
and
not
much
else
the
taste
was
also
very
subdued
wheat
and
the
drinkability
was
pretty
high
i
could
probably
substitute
this
for
water
on
a
hot
day
im
not
implying
that
the
taste
is
watery
just
that
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
good
session
beer
for
a
picnic
not
so
great
if
you
are
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
distinct
quality
wits
good
for
them
the
taste
is
decent
with
hints
of
malts
and
citrus
its
not
very
hoppy
the
mouthfeel
is
also
pretty
good
being
medium
bodied
and
smooth
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
will
definitely
get
this
beer
again
the
taste
was
much
thinner
then
i
remembered
but
id
attribute
this
to
the
maturity
of
my
palate
still
this
was
very
representative
of
the
style
light
crisp
lots
of
wheat
and
the
touch
of
coriander
definitely
a
nice
summer
refresher
golden
color
with
minimal
head
as
before
vague
coriander
and
maybe
a
hint
of
orange
peel
on
the
nose
on
the
palate
lacking
a
bit
of
the
freshness
and
lacking
an
orange
slice
this
tasted
more
like
there
was
a
macrolager
hiding
beneath
the
corianderwheat
flavors
a
bit
tired
take
home
message
when
you
want
a
refreshing
beer
on
tap
and
you
dont
mind
a
beer
that
sort
of
needs
a
garnish
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
for
taking
home
the
bottle
can
pretty
much
be
skipped
the
taste
has
orange
and
other
citrus
flavour
up
front
followed
by
some
wheat
and
coriander
put
them
all
together
and
well
it
doesnt
seem
to
work
for
me
at
all
i
cant
say
much
more
than
that
other
than
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
and
the
other
5
bottles
of
it
that
i
have
will
be
tough
to
finish
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
to
pint
glass
good
2
finger
foamy
head
that
left
some
nice
lace
golden
yellow
almost
strawlike
in
color
unique
color
in
my
opinion
citrus
like
smell
with
a
touch
of
hops
citrus
is
present
in
the
taste
as
well
with
lemon
dominating
the
flavor
well
balanced
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
very
light
and
crisp
very
refreshing
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
perfect
for
summer
my
gal
had
a
slice
of
orange
in
hers
and
i
have
to
admit
that
really
spiced
it
up
a
bit
worth
a
try
i
dont
understand
why
new
belgium
releases
any
of
their
nonbelgian
styles
i
havent
liked
one
yet
including
the
famous
fat
tire
i
guess
youve
got
to
pay
the
bills
i
call
bs
d
easy
to
drink
but
so
is
tap
water
a
little
more
flavor
here
would
be
much
appreciated
light
is
the
operative
word
in
the
style
description
here
drinkability
refreshing
i
might
have
it
again
at
the
restaurant
i
was
eating
at
since
it
does
little
to
impact
the
flavor
of
the
food
however
im
pretty
confident
that
i
wont
go
out
and
buy
this
one
for
home
unless
its
to
please
a
lightweight
guest
smells
of
light
citrus
and
yeast
tastes
fuller
than
expected
orange
flavors
up
front
with
a
finish
of
the
wheat
after
a
few
more
drinks
a
lime
flavor
comes
out
no
yeast
flavor
detected
this
beer
isnt
quite
as
light
as
a
white
but
is
just
as
drinkable
id
be
able
to
down
several
on
a
hot
summers
day
a
good
overall
beer
id
buy
it
again
this
reminds
me
of
the
blue
moon
spring
ale
but
better
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
forming
a
very
thin
head
and
leaving
very
light
lacing
very
light
citrus
aroma
taste
is
very
light
wheat
citrus
flavor
light
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
noncomplex
ale
light
and
smooth
a
very
sessionable
brew
but
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
thick
white
head
which
leaves
a
nice
fine
white
lace
behind
as
you
drink
smells
clean
and
a
bit
fruity
but
nothing
overpowering
feels
somewhat
thick
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
balance
of
carbonation
not
too
watery
as
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
tastes
quite
pleasant
with
orange
flavors
coming
out
but
very
mild
not
too
strong
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
from
new
belgium
d
this
beer
is
easier
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
lower
abv
of
4
8
compared
to
other
new
belgium
beers
it
is
easier
to
control
a
pleasant
buzz
after
a
couple
of
these
beers
the
abrasiveness
of
the
carbonation
will
start
to
compound
might
change
the
overall
flavor
pours
with
a
white
head
that
settles
vey
quickly
very
clear
yellow
in
color
not
overly
carbonated
not
a
lot
of
odor
or
discernable
taste
nothing
that
really
stands
out
or
offends
the
senses
its
good
to
see
a
beer
that
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
extremely
easy
to
drink
but
other
than
that
nothing
to
write
home
about
without
the
foamy
white
head
this
beer
would
look
very
similar
to
a
glass
of
bud
or
miller
yes
it
looks
fizzy
and
yellow
the
smell
is
beyond
subtle
and
almost
nonexistent
some
spicy
notes
are
barely
detectable
but
it
has
nothing
else
in
the
nose
the
taste
unfortunately
is
as
lackluster
as
the
smell
its
far
from
offensive
but
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
recommend
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
light
on
the
bright
side
it
does
slide
down
the
gullet
quite
easily
on
a
warm
early
spring
afternoon
however
this
is
a
passer
in
the
future
first
stop
on
my
day
with
new
belgium
decent
wheat
beer
not
the
best
pours
out
a
bright
oglden
with
good
deal
of
carbonation
a
thin
head
and
some
decent
lacing
smell
is
of
course
wheaty
in
a
crackerlike
way
good
amount
of
coriander
and
citrus
peel
as
well
smells
rather
clean
the
flavor
starts
off
really
pleasant
with
the
coriander
orange
and
wheat
but
then
finishes
a
bit
too
grainy
for
my
tastes
light
bodied
and
kind
of
prickly
this
is
far
from
stellar
but
it
is
a
good
drinker
at
least
poures
a
crystal
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
and
citrus
in
particular
lemon
and
a
little
orange
taste
is
of
spicy
wheat
and
citrus
a
pretty
drinkable
american
wheat
a
beer
that
i
dont
mind
having
once
in
a
while
and
makes
for
a
nice
summer
session
brew
sunshine
wheat
beer
pours
straw
colored
with
a
pure
white
head
that
falls
quickly
bubbles
rise
quickly
from
the
glass
i
smell
wheat
citrus
and
hints
of
pine
the
flavor
was
mostly
wheat
with
subtle
citrusy
hop
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
great
very
full
bodied
for
the
color
the
drinkability
on
this
is
good
and
would
be
better
if
it
was
warm
outside
instead
of
upstate
ny
in
december
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
little
spiced
it
has
a
lemony
and
citrusy
flavor
the
head
wasnt
impressive
and
the
nose
was
nice
but
faint
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
would
probably
be
better
as
a
summertime
beer
it
has
a
bit
of
a
dry
aftertaste
but
it
wasnt
bad
mouthfeel
was
good
and
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
its
worth
a
try
i
tried
this
at
illegal
petes
on
pearl
st
while
visiting
boulder
its
a
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
crisp
and
clean
with
a
mild
inoffensive
flavour
a
mild
wheat
beer
to
be
sure
i
tried
this
on
a
cold
november
day
and
im
sure
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
more
had
it
been
summertime
to
be
fair
i
should
try
it
again
as
i
was
more
in
the
mood
for
a
pale
ale
but
my
girlfriend
wanted
to
share
this
with
me
this
one
arrived
with
a
huge
frothy
bonewhite
head
it
had
extremely
bright
clarity
in
a
palelemon
colored
beer
with
fantastic
effervescence
the
nose
had
a
faint
wheatdriven
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
full
thanks
to
the
aforementioned
effervescence
the
taste
was
light
and
slightly
fruity
with
a
very
refreshing
dryness
on
the
finish
sunshine
wheat
beer
was
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
did
not
last
long
and
soon
only
a
ring
remained
the
aroma
was
mainly
citrus
the
taste
was
lemon
a
little
sweet
upfront
and
drying
out
in
the
finish
the
body
was
light
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
was
fairly
good
overall
it
a
pretty
average
wheat
beer
d
wasnt
expecting
much
upon
first
pour
however
smell
and
taste
is
very
above
average
for
wheat
beers
in
my
opinion
i
drove
about
30
minutes
to
get
this
beer
and
would
gladly
do
it
again
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
flavorful
similar
to
a
hefe
weizen
but
its
decent
for
what
it
is
the
filtering
of
the
yeast
seemed
to
remove
some
complexity
this
beer
is
still
refreshing
a
good
pick
of
the
sunshine
of
summer
poured
a
hazy
blonde
very
similar
to
a
witbier
or
hefe
with
notable
carbonation
very
small
head
but
with
some
lace
making
it
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
wheat
and
malt
are
in
the
forefront
with
honey
lemon
and
coriander
also
making
an
appearance
overall
sweet
and
clean
with
a
crisp
carbonated
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
especially
during
the
summer
a
light
pale
hazy
blonde
with
strong
bubbling
emerges
after
the
pour
a
mild
head
and
par
foam
is
also
noted
plenty
of
light
fruit
and
spices
hit
the
nose
a
nice
wheat
character
is
developed
nicely
in
the
front
of
teh
palate
thats
where
the
spices
make
the
best
presence
plenty
of
lighter
malts
also
felt
in
the
tongue
a
pretty
ginger
ale
dry
sweet
beer
nice
and
refreshing
perfect
for
stefleling
hot
summer
afternoons
and
nights
d
give
me
a
thousand
of
these
on
a
hot
muggy
summer
day
like
today
and
youll
have
a
thousand
empties
by
tomorrow
its
quite
a
thirst
quencher
during
the
winter
though
i
might
only
finish
500
not
overly
exciting
but
still
an
easy
drinker
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
it
could
be
a
bit
more
full
flavored
in
terms
of
taste
but
a
very
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
brew
just
the
same
straw
colored
a
little
haze
but
definitely
see
through
average
white
head
lasted
throughout
as
usual
for
new
belgium
aroma
is
very
wheaty
and
bready
of
lemon
grass
and
orange
peel
and
a
fair
amount
of
coriander
pretty
complex
aroma
for
a
simple
pale
wheat
beer
the
taste
was
alright
at
first
i
thought
i
was
a
bit
strong
in
coriander
for
my
liking
but
that
kind
of
mellowed
as
the
beer
went
on
as
in
the
aroma
it
tasted
very
wheaty
with
lemon
grass
and
orange
peel
sparkling
tangy
mouthfeel
aftertaste
doesnt
last
long
kind
of
a
plain
beer
all
in
all
but
great
for
drinking
on
hot
days
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
nice
puffy
white
head
coriander
and
orange
on
the
nose
flavors
are
citrus
sour
but
pleasent
havent
been
overly
thrilled
with
nbb
however
this
one
was
very
nice
light
albeit
somewhat
watery
refreshing
summer
time
brew
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
the
bottle
pours
a
five
finger
pillowy
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
a
good
lace
chrystal
clear
pale
yellowamber

previous

ended
up
with
a
bad
bottle
best
before
aug
2006
1
30
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
liquid
solutions
tigard
or
ill
review
this
again
next
time
i
find
it
but
for
now
thats
all
i
have
this
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
very
light
thin
head
the
smell
contains
notes
of
citrus
and
malt
mouthfeel
and
taste
was
very
light
with
hints
of
orange
there
is
a
very
light
hint
hops
in
the
aftertaste
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
quench
your
thirst
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
is
otherwise
relatively
unremarkable
id
drink
it
again
if
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
it
d
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
its
very
light
and
refreshing
too
bad
its
not
available
in
minnesota
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
shadow
of
a
witbier
the
orange
and
coriander
do
stand
out
but
only
for
a
moment
and
the
rest
of
the
beer
fails
to
back
it
up
with
characteristic
witbier
complexity
the
finish
is
just
bland
i
like
nbs
lineup
for
the
most
part
but
this
is
definitely
the
least
of
their
beers
i
have
tried
on
tap
at
the
denver
airport
pale
gold
and
clear
with
lots
of
carbonation
aromas
of
grainy
wheat
lemon
along
with
some
mild
floral
and
spice
notes
the
flavors
are
tart
lemon
and
perhaps
some
light
centennial
hops
light
bodied
and
refreshing
without
feeling
overly
watery
simple
and
refreshing
and
still
full
of
flavor
a
good
warm
weather
session
beer
drinkability
easy
to
have
a
lot
of
these
in
a
day
and
not
worry
about
being
too
intoxicated
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
lots
of
fizzing
action
and
a
good
whitish
permihead
aroma
is
subdued
but
a
nice
amount
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
taste
is
likewise
with
a
nice
orange
peel
front
with
a
leveling
maltwheat
base
that
evens
out
and
finishes
with
a
nice
coriander
body
is
light
and
springy
and
very
refreshing
particularly
after
this
hot
day
whenever
i
see
new
belgium
i
dont
see
this
which
is
kind
of
sad
because
id
most
likely
pick
it
up
again
had
one
with
dinner
at
the
bellagio
in
vegas
not
impressed
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dull
gold
with
a
minimum
head
small
white
head
some
citrusy
smell
but
not
pronounced
taste
did
not
stand
up
some
wheat
smoothnessbut
the
overall
taste
had
too
much
lemon
and
was
pretty
bland
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
weak
and
watery
i
had
no
problem
finishing
one
but
would
not
have
ordered
another
overall
impression
not
bad
but
not
very
interesting
either
definitely
pass
this
one
over
for
new
belgiums
more
interesting
offerings
maybe
they
will
replace
this
with
their
new
wit
pours
leaving
only
a
faint
wisp
of
foam
that
dissolves
into
a
clear
pale
yellowstraw
colored
body
the
smell
does
not
present
strongly
with
only
hints
of
coriander
and
orange
spice
the
taste
is
mild
and
bready
carrying
a
light
sweetness
with
notes
of
orange
and
other
citrus
finish
is
not
particularly
remarkable
overall
flavor
is
quite
mild
and
simple
the
body
is
light
with
a
decent
burst
of
carbonation
drinkablilty
fares
well
as
you
can
finish
it
easily
although
the
lack
of
complexity
makes
it
hard
to
come
back
to
for
another
bought
a
sixpack
to
bring
with
me
fishing
yesterday
had
one
of
them
from
the
bottle
and
thought
it
was
assawful
just
terrible
it
tasted
like
an
american
lager
of
the
worst
sort
but
then
i
gave
it
a
second
shot
at
home
poured
one
into
a
glass
its
got
a
very
light
look
to
it
almost
like
diet
lemonade
or
something
and
what
a
bright
white
head
very
uniform
tiny
bubbles
like
champagne
the
taste
improved
tenfold
cool
crisp
wheaty
beautiful
light
flavor
and
super
freshing
i
poured
myself
another
right
after
the
first
crispclean
feeling
leaves
me
thirsty
d
the
sourness
isnt
bad
but
im
wondering
if
this
ones
past
its
prime
i
may
try
and
find
a
fresher
batch
next
time
if
there
is
a
next
time
d
super
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
pretty
good
beer
nicely
flavored
the
underlying
brew
could
be
a
little
better
but
worth
a
try
ill
not
hesitate
to
buy
some
more
of
these
during
the
summer
i
was
expecting
a
maltier
and
breadier
beer
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
perhaps
just
the
name
is
misleading
pours
an
almost
neon
straw
yellow
with
a
cm
of
snow
white
head
that
fades
instantly
nose
is
a
weak
mix
of
cracker
lemon
juice
ground
pepper
and
a
hint
of
coriander
taste
is
slightly
acidic
a
bit
spicy
a
little
citrus
sweet
yet
overall
uninspiring
even
for
an
apwa
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
watery
very
little
body
to
speak
of
a
rather
uninspiring
stab
at
a
lawnmower
beer
not
bad
but
not
impressive
in
any
way
either
yawn
cheers2beers
smell
is
faint
and
hardly
there
some
citrus
flavors
in
the
aroma
tastes
of
coriander
and
ground
orange
peel
but
there
needs
to
be
much
more
flavor
from
the
spices
for
this
to
even
be
considered
adequate
and
the
yeast
and
malt
character
are
far
from
ample
light
in
body
and
character
dull
disappointig
yeast
character
terrible
especially
considering
the
style
pours
a
crystal
clear
super
light
pale
yellow
color
much
like
a
american
light
lager
blah
good
amount
of
head
is
produced
with
decent
tracing
aromas
of
wheat
biscuit
a
little
spice
and
lemon
light
overall
however
flavor
is
rather
light
high
in
the
biscuity
flavors
with
a
mild
citrusy
background
high
carbonation
very
refreshing
certainly
not
the
time
of
year
to
be
enjoying
hops
show
nothing
giving
it
a
little
tartness
in
the
end
i
cant
wait
to
stock
the
fridge
with
this
when
the
hot
kansas
summer
comes
along
certainly
a
light
beer
which
isnt
so
much
appealing
but
it
has
its
place
would
choose
any
nb
brew
over
this
but
not
a
bad
attempt
overall
impression
clean
and
easy
this
is
one
to
woo
your
macro
friends
with
great
coriander
taste
no
flaws
noted
bravo
a
tough
style
to
really
wow
me
with
but
nb
did
it
recommended
drinkability
is
ok
for
the
styleonce
again
dont
see
the
point
of
making
watered
down
wheat
shit
and
calling
it
american
but
if
rating
to
style
guess
this
one
is
as
good
as
any
of
them
thanks
to
bcg
bif
and
babydoc
for
this
one
fyi
it
was
served
with
a
lemon
i
didnt
use
it
wifey
really
liked
hers
too
i
can
see
us
enjoying
these
on
the
deck
as
we
watch
the
purple
martins
new
belgium
is
available
over
here
where
i
work
in
missouri
but
it
doesnt
cross
the
illinois
border
yet
d
a
good
session
beer
id
say
this
beer
is
good
for
those
who
want
to
watch
some
football
but
not
have
to
drink
adjunctladen
macrobrews
but
as
for
a
hierarchy
of
taste
this
one
is
not
really
too
premium
in
spite
of
being
somewhat
boring
its
very
drinkable
and
an
easy
session
brew
especially
on
a
warm
day
in
the
sun
drinkability
id
drink
this
again
i
think
it
was
indeed
tasty
and
i
do
enjoy
a
good
wheat
beer
not
so
with
this
one
however
grassy
lemon
notes
blend
with
a
slight
musty
character
to
make
it
very
interesting
in
the
nose
sptritzy
and
peppery
with
a
slight
acidity
and
more
lemony
notes
as
it
goes
down
this
may
be
the
best
american
wheat
ive
had
very
good
very
refreshing
and
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
it
might
have
been
the
fact
that
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
but
i
enjoyed
sunshine
more
than
any
of
the
other
beers
we
tasted
there
it
was
extremely
smooth
if
maybe
a
little
weak
but
that
surprizingly
did
not
detract
from
my
enjoyment
of
the
brew
hints
of
wheat
fruit
and
maybe
a
little
honey
in
there
too
havent
had
it
in
the
bottle
so
maybe
it
doesnt
translate
to
an
enclosed
environment
all
that
well
a
little
thin
on
taste
but
definitely
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
should
go
well
with
most
food
and
will
definitely
work
well
as
a
cooler
in
hot
weather
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
but
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
best
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
brewery
but
when
your
12
hours
drive
away
the
bottle
will
do
opinion
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
light
i
know
that
wheat
beers
arent
supposed
to
be
imperial
but
the
backbone
to
the
malt
really
isnt
there
it
is
nice
that
it
is
so
clear
but
the
body
is
gone
as
evidenced
by
the
head
retention
this
beer
may
actually
benefit
from
the
traditional
weizen
thinslice
of
lemon
a
year
later
and
a
twelvepack
of
this
pretty
okay
brew
and
ive
got
to
say
its
fairly
decent
not
overly
complex
just
enough
malted
wheat
and
hops
mix
to
keep
things
fairly
interesting
hints
of
orange
and
clove
are
there
but
not
nearly
like
a
german
hw
this
might
just
be
interesting
enough
to
be
a
decent
session
beer
the
abv
is
in
the
right
range
to
be
sure
straw
coloured
without
much
head
this
smells
and
tastes
very
much
of
apricot
if
you
like
apricot
youll
surely
appreciate
this
but
if
not
you
should
probably
steer
well
clear
of
it
strong
carbonation
but
with
pin
prick
type
bubbles
help
to
make
this
feel
very
refreshing
and
definitely
a
summer
beer
there
is
a
slight
lingering
cereal
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
fast
moving
carbonation
that
attacks
the
mouth
goes
down
fairly
easily
but
overall
it
doesnt
grab
me
the
spiciness
does
kick
it
up
a
notch
against
most
of
the
other
bland
pale
wheat
ales
worth
a
shot
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
thanks
mentor
for
the
opportunity
boring
light
thirst
quencher
here
i
can
see
the
use
of
this
as
a
lawnmower
beer
but
it
isnt
that
great
this
was
an
all
around
boring
beer
for
me
it
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
little
sticky
lace
the
was
very
mild
and
smelt
of
wheat
and
light
hops
it
tasted
very
lightbodied
and
a
little
floral
hint
here
and
there
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
that
tasty
im
not
sure
that
i
can
describe
this
beer
any
better
than
average
it
had
decent
color
amber
decent
carbonation
light
mouthfeel
the
smell
was
mild
light
floral
sweetness
the
taste
was
about
the
same
a
nice
floral
sweetness
and
a
good
sweet
bready
malt
nothing
steller
but
decent
easy
to
drink
at
least
i
would
drink
this
again
it
was
one
of
the
better
examples
from
the
u
s
appearance
transparent
straw
color
with
a
pale
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
contains
hay
citrus
and
grains
initially
it
hits
the
tongue
with
cloves
and
some
pretty
slim
amounts
of
malt
and
hops
watery
thin
and
lacking
in
much
flavor
one
is
left
wanting
more
and
quite
unsatisfied
try
widmer
bros
hefe
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
bright
gold
color
and
is
topped
by
a
frothy
pale
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
sweet
grassy
grain
note
to
it
as
well
as
a
hint
of
candied
orange
aromatics
to
it
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
up
front
with
a
definite
citrus
note
and
a
hint
of
acidity
to
it
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
in
its
simplicity
there
are
some
spicy
hints
of
ginger
and
pepper
in
the
finish
as
well
this
really
is
a
summer
time
refresher
light
quaffable
and
fairly
straight
forward
despite
the
simplicity
it
is
quite
enjoyable
but
the
taste
is
smooth
and
subtley
sweet
it
isnt
sugary
or
syrupy
sweet
it
is
a
good
tasting
wheat
with
a
pleasant
rice
candy
or
summer
fruit
taste
very
refreshing
this
is
probably
realistically
about
as
good
as
you
can
expect
from
this
style
bright
clear
and
covered
with
a
nice
head
a
fresh
nose
and
a
clean
first
sip
make
this
a
good
summer
drink
that
make
not
mistakes
but
also
creates
little
real
excitement
a
decent
beer
in
a
style
that
hits
the
quality
ceiling
pretty
quickly
got
this
one
for
free
from
work
about
1
finger
of
bright
white
head
on
top
of
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
colored
brew
the
head
quickly
deminishes
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
smell
is
rather
spicy
taste
is
clean
with
some
fruitty
spicyness
i
am
partial
to
the
texture
and
body
of
wheat
beers
something
about
them
just
seems
to
go
down
quite
nice
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
golden
yellow
the
head
is
white
but
is
nearly
non
existant
i
see
absolutely
no
laces
the
beer
looks
like
apple
juice
in
a
glass
not
cloudy
like
you
would
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
it
smells
fruity
i
detect
bananas
and
lemon
maybe
a
little
honey
also
it
tastes
like
honey
it
has
a
slight
citrus
taste
to
it
also
the
flavor
is
so
mild
that
it
is
almost
non
existant
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
it
leaves
a
slight
honey
taste
on
the
palate
it
goes
down
smooth
it
is
carbonated
well
this
beer
would
make
a
good
session
beer
if
you
dont
like
beer
it
has
so
little
flavor
that
it
is
boring
you
could
drink
a
case
by
your
self
with
no
problem
this
one
is
not
worth
your
time
or
money
i
will
probably
never
drink
this
beer
again
pours
a
clear
goldenstraw
color
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
nice
nose
of
wheat
ale
yeast
and
notes
of
lemon
and
honey
palate
is
wellbalanced
with
light
floral
hops
complementing
the
subtle
malt
character
a
touch
of
spiciness
on
the
finish
with
additional
notes
of
citrus
mediumbodied
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
great
on
a
cool
spring
evening
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
has
no
real
faults
just
sort
of
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
a
decent
wheat
beer
its
not
exactly
like
a
euro
heffe
but
its
pretty
close
reminds
me
of
summer
in
the
mountains
new
belgium
recommends
serving
it
with
an
orange
instead
of
a
lemon
and
i
think
theyre
probably
right
because
it
already
has
quite
a
bit
of
lemon
in
it
has
a
nice
straw
color
but
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
hints
of
corriander
and
orange
peel
in
the
smell
but
very
clear
and
crisp
in
appearance
i
think
a
previous
reviewers
opinion
of
apple
juice
in
appearance
was
very
accurate
i
would
be
very
interested
to
try
this
offerring
in
its
unfiltered
state
hint
hint
refreshing
crisp
and
clean
very
suited
to
a
hot
weather
beer
i
am
big
fan
of
hoegaarden
and
i
would
rate
this
as
a
close
second
to
that
a
worthy
offerring
from
nb
i
would
love
to
have
a
handful
of
these
on
a
sunny
day
this
would
be
a
great
replacement
for
the
stereotypical
beach
beer
corona
because
this
is
actually
tasty
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
but
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
there
are
a
lot
better
beers
out
there
in
this
style
the
taste
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
blue
moon
but
i
like
it
better
and
not
just
because
of
the
macro
factor
it
has
a
coriander
and
orange
peel
taste
on
top
of
the
malty
wheat
base
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
only
the
slightest
bit
dry
very
highly
drinkable
if
you
are
a
wheat
beer
fan
check
it
out
light
bodied
and
crisp
mouthfeel
is
flat
and
watery
with
not
much
carbonation
and
almost
no
body
drinkability
is
great
if
you
dont
want
to
taste
your
ale
if
youre
in
to
this
kind
of
thing
save
your
money
buy
natural
light
and
squeeze
a
bit
of
orange
into
it
maybe
a
dash
of
coriander
if
youre
feeling
rich
drinkability
drinkable
but
i
really
wouldnt
order
another
one
on
tap
i
never
thought
i
would
ever
say
anything
negative
about
new
belgium
but
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
their
offerings
it
reminds
me
of
gasp
a
bud
light
no
head
no
aroma
no
character
to
speak
of
it
was
even
kind
of
flat
with
no
lacing
and
very
little
carbonation
pale
straw
yellow
with
little
taste
despite
the
labels
proclamations
of
coriander
and
orange
i
taste
nothing
of
the
ilk
a
comparison
to
other
wheat
beers
is
a
mismatch
boulevard
wheat
blows
it
away
this
is
just
a
plain
beer
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
regularly
now
abbey
ale
on
the
other
hand
that
is
simply
heavenly
this
beer
almost
reminds
of
the
hoegaarden
white
except
not
as
good
it
certainly
smells
nice
but
the
taste
is
too
watery
doesnt
really
have
an
appealing
appearance
either
its
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
but
id
rather
have
hoegaarden
pours
very
light
pale
wheat
colored
a
little
head
medium
carbonation
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
taste
is
quite
light
nice
wheat
notes
but
very
light
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
id
drink
this
if
i
didnt
really
want
a
beer
its
a
bit
too
light
for
me
all
in
all
this
new
belgium
sunshine
wheat
beer
is
a
good
offering
from
the
people
at
new
belgium
and
i
will
be
back
for
more
very
refreshing
beer
considered
as
a
belgian
wit
it
has
the
some
of
the
requisite
flavors
but
in
small
amounts
as
an
american
wheat
as
its
listed
here
however
it
makes
an
excellent
much
more
interesting
beer
than
many
us
wheat
beers
id
like
some
more
yeast
character
but
thats
a
quibble
i
have
enjoyed
all
of
the
other
new
belgium
offerings
but
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
somewhat
disappointing
with
limited
new
belgium
experience
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
this
would
be
a
good
beer
if
you
just
finished
mowing
the
yard
but
not
for
much
else
this
12
oz
bottle
was
provide
in
person
by
southernbrew
the
beer
poured
pale
macro
yellow
with
a
small
ring
of
fizzy
bubbles
id
not
even
call
it
a
head
that
disappeared
rapidly
the
aroma
was
totally
unlike
the
attributes
the
label
suggested
all
i
could
detect
was
graininess
and
faint
sweetish
malts
there
was
no
hint
of
banana
orange
peel
or
coriander
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
clean
and
dull
there
was
no
wheat
beer
fruity
edge
instead
this
was
basically
a
purified
and
cleaned
up
macro
there
was
a
lemony
twang
in
the
finish
with
a
hint
of
spiciness
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
few
notches
above
most
macros
there
was
nothing
really
wrong
with
the
beer
except
for
the
allusion
of
getting
a
belgian
style
wheat
beer
on
the
label
i
am
sorry
but
this
is
not
even
close
to
that
the
taste
greatly
resembled
the
smell
with
a
good
base
of
wheat
and
malt
with
a
nice
citrus
tartness
off
setting
it
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
pleasent
beer
that
is
great
to
drink
anytime
and
especially
during
the
summer
a
decent
wit
i
prefer
mine
with
more
substance
yeast
and
orange
oomph
but
this
would
make
a
satisfying
thirstquencher
on
a
hot
summerday
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
wit
i
have
had
better
samples
in
the
past
but
even
those
are
pretty
mediocre
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
wheat
by
a
company
that
i
believe
has
a
pretty
good
lineup
over
all
very
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
im
not
a
fan
of
tossing
a
lemon
into
a
beer
but
the
citrusy
taste
that
this
one
brings
with
it
is
a
very
good
addition
this
beer
pours
a
very
pale
color
reminds
me
of
bud
light
way
too
light
needs
some
cloudyness
the
aroma
was
very
much
orange
citrus
and
not
much
else
the
body
wasnt
there
the
taste
was
very
much
citrus
as
well
i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
beer
it
isnt
what
i
call
a
witbier
uninteresting
thanks
to
the
mystery
beerfairy
that
left
this
on
my
doorstep
today
this
one
pours
a
very
transparent
slightly
golden
yellow
the
nose
is
overpowering
orange
citrus
no
malts
come
through
in
this
one
the
head
is
nonexistant
the
flavor
is
citrusy
and
thin
there
is
a
grainygrassy
finish
blah
mouthfeel
is
light
this
would
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
on
a
very
hot
day
very
cold
bleh
its
light
and
refreshing
with
a
little
belgian
snap
to
it
this
is
ok
in
a
bland
sort
of
way
but
not
very
memorable
since
this
one
is
past
its
best
by
date
ill
give
it
another
chance
sometime
though
it
didnt
taste
spoiled
in
any
way
theres
just
not
much
here
it
seems
consumed
in
october
2004
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
quickly
with
virtually
zero
lace
a
deep
yellow
straw
colored
liquid
sits
in
my
glass
smells
of
cloves
and
corriander
fill
the
air
maybe
a
grassy
smell
as
well
tastes
pretty
much
like
the
smell
dated
oct
14
so
its
pretty
close
to
its
freshnesses
end
tastes
kinda
like
a
witbier
bud
not
the
best
thing
has
a
bit
of
character
though
would
like
to
try
it
from
the
tap
and
see
the
difference
no
need
to
do
the
bottle
again
theres
a
nice
little
bit
of
hoppiness
here
but
overall
well
its
a
light
beer
that
would
fit
a
few
occasions
perfectly
would
i
lust
over
it
or
even
really
buy
it
nah
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
mild
wheat
scent
with
limited
yeast
fruitiness
it
seems
to
have
some
pale
malts
as
well
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
crisp
and
spicey
wheat
flavor
with
some
malts
there
is
a
touch
of
coriander
and
bitter
orange
peel
in
here
to
spice
up
the
taste
nice
touch
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
seasonal
wheat
beer
i
was
skeptical
with
the
aroma
and
appearance
but
the
taste
made
up
for
it
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
overall
felt
like
very
much
like
a
lite
wheat
beer
and
whilst
it
was
better
than
the
other
big3
choices
on
offer
at
the
airport
it
is
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
rather
a
disappointment
actually
i
expected
better
from
new
belgium
way
too
thin
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
colored
beer
with
a
medium
head
with
average
retention
aroma
is
quite
strong
on
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
side
and
a
bit
weak
on
the
wheat
side
i
think
just
a
bit
more
balance
would
have
been
appreciated
the
coriander
and
the
orange
peel
which
lent
a
funky
feeling
also
overpower
taste
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
thin
and
body
is
just
above
average
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
was
expected
sunshine
wheat
pours
a
light
and
shiny
golden
shade
with
a
two
finger
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
carbonation
is
pretty
high
aroma
is
mainly
of
wheat
but
a
nice
lemony
zest
is
also
detected
taste
is
fairly
lightbodied
especially
the
wheat
lemony
finish
is
the
strong
flavor
here
flavor
is
nice
and
light
but
i
think
it
could
have
been
a
little
more
complex
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
summertime
brew
this
seems
like
a
solid
example
of
the
style
based
on
the
three
witbiers
ive
had
but
im
sure
there
is
plenty
better
out
there
pours
a
darker
golden
yellow
with
slight
haziness
the
head
is
a
nice
2
inch
thick
beauty
however
doesnt
hold
up
through
the
session
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
strong
of
straw
and
buttered
bread
slight
light
sweet
sugar
malts
detected
the
taste
is
clean
and
refreshing
but
lacking
alot
of
taste
the
bready
straw
taste
is
what
comes
clear
a
hint
of
lemon
detected
the
two
dont
creat
the
harmony
i
like
light
bodied
and
refreshing
but
not
the
best
or
even
close
really
note
the
style
has
since
been
changed
to
american
pale
wheat
ale
which
explains
a
lot
drinkability
very
good
not
the
best
wit
ive
had
but
better
than
most
looks
like
apple
juice
clear
light
golden
with
an
almost
lifeless
amount
of
carbonation
almost
the
perfect
aroma
for
a
wit
not
too
perfumey
just
the
right
amount
of
orange
and
corriander
spice
a
little
wheat
and
a
little
lemon
nice
refreshing
brew
good
spicing
on
the
palate
some
wheat
tang
just
the
slightest
bit
of
bitterness
more
carbonated
than
it
looks
but
could
use
a
little
more
medium
body
leaves
the
palate
clean
not
bad
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
not
much
head
to
speak
of
no
sediment
no
nice
fluffy
head
not
very
impressive
aromas
of
toasted
malt
and
coriander
but
not
much
of
the
fruitiness
i
was
hoping
for
taste
like
the
aroma
alot
of
toasted
malt
and
some
light
spiciness
with
the
toasted
flavor
coming
thru
again
in
the
finish
with
a
very
light
wheatiness
to
it
not
much
to
this
beer
thought
it
might
be
a
little
better
but
decent
for
the
porch
on
a
warm
day
like
today
ng
this
beer
poured
a
very
faint
yellow
with
a
head
that
dissapated
really
fast
the
smell
is
a
citrus
and
kinda
spicy
smell
to
it
the
taste
sure
has
some
spice
to
it
from
the
coriander
its
a
well
rounded
beer
has
a
nice
clean
flavorfull
aftertaste
you
could
pound
this
all
day
long
you
could
down
it
any
chance
easier
then
some
bmc
creation
but
its
sublte
cahrecters
are
the
reason
why
you
slwoly
savor
this
well
made
brew
i
had
this
beer
at
the
brewery
originally
and
i
think
my
excitement
of
actually
being
there
a
day
after
skiing
in
june
and
a
week
into
a
beerskiingflyfishing
cross
country
trip
may
have
tainted
my
original
judgement
at
the
time
i
thought
it
was
an
exceptional
wheat
beer
now
id
place
it
at
average
i
just
cracked
open
a
bottle
brought
to
me
by
a
friend
and
i
was
a
bit
let
down
its
better
than
your
average
american
wheat
beer
but
it
doesnt
approach
other
belgian
style
offerings
such
as
blanche
de
brooklyn
or
whirlwind
wit
from
victory
its
a
bit
of
a
paradox
a
filtered
spiced
wheat
beer
pours
almost
lagergolden
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
spices
and
orange
are
evident
in
the
smell
at
first
taste
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
in
my
opinion
not
nearly
as
smooth
as
it
could
be
spicing
is
evident
but
not
as
pronounced
as
id
expect
from
a
nb
brew
finishes
a
bit
tart
and
dry
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
up
to
what
i
would
expect
from
nb
thanks
to
beer
angel
for
the
sample
nice
golden
yellow
color
lofty
head
smell
is
dominated
by
lemon
and
citrus
just
a
hint
of
pepper
and
spice
taste
is
smooth
and
mellow
but
very
citrusy
and
lemony
the
most
lemony
beer
ive
every
had
not
much
wheat
or
yeast
to
speak
of
and
the
pepper
and
spices
are
subtle
at
best
tasty
but
not
spectacular
this
is
exemplary
beer
and
towers
above
most
of
new
belgiums
brews
even
fat
tire
i
was
hoping
for
some
haziness
in
his
beer
but
i
found
none
sunshine
pours
clear
as
well
sunshine
a
very
clear
straw
color
and
really
looks
like
a
decent
lager
which
is
too
bad
considering
it
is
a
wheat
the
smell
was
light
and
crisp
with
a
bit
of
graininess
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
to
the
taste
in
this
beer
it
tasted
like
a
watered
down
wheat
there
was
a
very
subtle
hint
of
spices
that
were
so
weak
i
couldnt
place
them
i
was
hoping
to
find
some
complex
yeast
flavors
but
found
none
the
bottle
says
it
was
brewed
in
belgian
wheat
tradition
but
how
can
that
be
if
they
dont
bother
with
the
secondary
fermentation
all
in
all
this
seems
sort
of
like
the
diet
coke
of
wheat
beers
if
you
want
something
light
and
refreshing
that
isnt
a
lager
this
is
for
you
but
if
you
want
an
interesting
and
tasty
wheat
beer
look
elsewhere
it
is
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
the
aroma
is
light
and
has
some
berries
in
the
nose
the
body
is
creamy
yet
light
with
some
fruitiness
it
finishes
with
a
delicate
bitterness
a
decent
refreshing
wheat
beer
since
nb
is
not
local
to
me
i
wont
be
stretching
too
far
to
drink
this
beer
often
arrives
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
frothy
bright
white
head
somewhat
thin
because
the
bartender
kindly
filled
me
to
the
brim
straw
yellow
body
smell
is
a
subtle
flourish
of
yeast
and
subdued
malt
sweetness
earthy
and
solid
taste
opens
with
a
yeasty
hop
bitterness
that
levels
out
into
a
slightly
spicy
blunt
plain
of
malts
and
yeast
aftertaste
is
sweet
like
buttery
fresh
baked
croissants
lots
of
carbonation
body
is
thin
and
refreshing
very
enjoyable
this
wheat
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
the
smell
was
very
faint
but
perhaps
a
slight
fruitiness
could
be
detected
the
taste
was
slightly
fruity
with
notes
of
wheat
some
floral
hops
light
grain
and
very
light
citrus
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
mediumlight
body
and
good
carbonation
this
was
a
decent
light
wheat
ale
on
tap
big
dissapointment
reminded
me
of
harpoons
ufo
there
arent
many
american
brewers
that
can
acomplish
a
decent
wheat
beer
in
my
opinion
this
one
poured
slightly
hazy
and
gold
with
an
ample
white
head
aroma
was
ok
wheatmalt
and
spice
perhaps
flavor
was
not
very
good
overall
very
average
final
thoughts
first
had
on
tap
came
served
cold
with
a
lemon
this
is
always
done
here
especially
with
the
boulevard
wheat
i
hate
lemon
wedges
or
lime
in
my
beer
if
i
want
fruit
in
my
beer
ill
ask
for
it
had
to
buy
a
six
to
review
at
home
can
be
had
on
sale
for
about
5
99
a
six
will
definately
purchase
again
without
the
lemons
solid
but
i
dont
know
if
i
like
my
beers
vegetabley
appearance
slightly
cloudy
golden
hue
with
a
rather
thin
white
head
but
it
does
leave
behind
thin
strips
of
lacing
between
each
sip
aroma
coriander
blended
with
wheat
bread
sweetness
some
definite
orange
peel
evident
as
well
a
bit
tame
but
nice
and
balanced
taste
incredibly
refreshing
with
the
smack
your
lips
together
sharp
sweetness
blended
with
the
spices
makes
me
happy
a
very
refreshing
tasty
version
of
this
style
mouthfeel
lighter
bodied
strong
carbonation
blends
well
in
the
mouth
has
a
nice
texture
going
down
adding
to
the
drinkability
drinkability
summer
wheat
that
can
be
enjoyed
year
round
in
my
opinion
this
is
excellent
so
drinkable
and
tasty
i
am
a
fan
question
whered
the
yeast
go
i
dont
know
except
that
it
wasnt
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
while
sunshine
wheat
is
drinkable
i
didnt
dump
it
it
looks
more
like
a
pilsener
minus
the
hops
profile
this
beer
is
almost
macroesque
in
stature
lacking
any
of
the
more
robust
aromas
and
flavors
of
other
witbiers
overall
a
dull
boring
beer
that
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
is
designed
in
the
belgian
wheat
beer
tradition
as
stated
on
the
label
lemon

wan
yellow

flavor
is
partially
spice
hop
citrus
and
sweet

but
all
balanced
charged
and
light
through

a
quality
brew
even
if
you
live
in
an
apartment
poured
a
clear
golden
with
little
carbonation
and
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
spicy
hops
with
a
touch
of
coriander
and
a
definite
orange
scent
taste
is
very
clean
with
a
light
fruity
flavor
that
is
citrus
with
a
further
citrus
flavor
from
the
coriander
it
is
very
clean
and
refreshing
though
a
little
weak
on
the
spices
it
has
a
creamy
maltiness
that
is
very
appealing
and
gives
this
beer
a
smooth
flavor
drinkable
on
a
sunny
day
when
the
lawnmower
calls
for
a
sacrifice
i
was
somewhat
dissappointed
with
this
beer
because
i
have
enjoyed
many
other
fat
tire
beers
within
their
line
and
i
really
feel
they
do
a
great
job
in
my
opinion
this
one
came
off
more
as
an
american
style
wheat
beer
it
has
a
very
nice
unoffensive
taste
a
nice
lemonycitrusy
aroma
and
a
mild
spiciness
compared
to
some
other
american
belgianwit
beers
this
one
lacks
the
spiciness
and
flavor
that
is
present
in
many
other
varieties
like
allaghash
or
victory
i
would
say
this
is
more
of
an
american
wheatbelgian
wit
hybrid
drinkable
but
not
aweinspiring
comments
this
is
a
very
nice
wheat
and
a
great
summer
drink
i
wish
i
had
discovered
it
earlier
in
the
season
a
warm
afternoon
by
the
grill
with
a
few
of
these
would
have
been
really
nice
light
gold
color
small
foamy
head
aroma
is
grassy
grainy
and
sweet
light

wheat
a
lighter
tasting
mild

wheat
beer
light
malts
and
hops
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
and
crisp
aftertaste
is
slightly
malty
flavor
this
is
a
slightly
crisp
hot
weather
beer
definitely
something
youd
have
after
mowing
the
lawn
i
will
definitely
have
this
beer
again
it
is
good
not
great
i
agree
with
some
other
reviews
that
the
label
wheat
on
this
beer
is
a
little
misleading
i
enjoyed
this
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
lotsa
bubbles
and
a
big
white
marshmallowy
head
i
kinda
wish
that
it
was
unfiltered
though
smell
is
tart
peppery
wheat
and
coriander
spicy
peppery
malts
dominate
the
palate
followed
by
a
yeastilybitter
orange
finish
not
great
and
not
my
favorite
new
belgium
summer
beer
see
loft
and
porch
swing
but
a
nice
refreshing
brew
comments

this
is
a
light
fruity
type
of
beer
the
wheat
in
the
name
is
misleading
as
it
conjures
weitzen
and
hearty
malts
for
the
bjcp
style
witbier
but
not
really
what
i
was
looking
for
it
had
an
citrusgrainy
flavor
but
with
some
lace
citrus
and
coriander
in
the
aroma
palate
is
sweetish

nothing

i
like
this
concept
a
hoppy
wheat

unfiltered
a
lot
of
my
top
beers
are
unfiltered
wheats
although
im
not
a
huge
hop

anyway
they
strike
a

here
and
the

on

boosts

rating
from

to

easy

its
the
little
things
in
life
that
make
it
great
i
might
have
to
look
for
this
beer
again
or
maybe
i
can
find
ophelia
the
redhead
instead
id
like
to
buy
her
a
beer
hippy
taste
smooth
going
down
just
like
a

weak
finish
overall
i
was
looking
for
something
different
and
this
did
the
trick
how
this
is
not
collaboratively
rated
very
good
or
outstanding
is
beyond
me
its
a
little
generous
with
the
hoppy
title
so
hopheads
may
not
approve
but
it
is
first
and
foremost
a
smooth
wheat
beer
with
a
slight
twist
of
leafy
twiggy
hop
its
just
damn
delicious
hoppy
with
a
very
clean
finish
o
as
a
hop
head
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
awesome
wheat
ale
hazy
and
great
o
overall
pretty
light
enjoyable
but
definitely
not
a
trip
through
flavor
country
much
like
another
ophelia
i
think
this
is
a
little
watery
a
hopheads
wheat
beer
but
not
too
hoppy
to
be
overpowering
of
the
subtle
wheat
nuances
very

you
can

it
the
smell

the

you
pick

another
spring
hopeful
ive
experienced
this
winter
on
draft
in
chicago
a
long
way
from
the
kettle
maybe
the
draftglass
was
compromisedbut
usually
not
at
this
barbut
i
got
nothing
from
this
beer
no
mosaic
aromas
no
head
no
lacing
nothing
materially
above
s
bud
i
will
chalk
this
up
to
distance
of
distribution
drink
this
at
the
brewery
or
close
to
home
where
it
was
handled
properly
bb
makes
good
beer
so
a
poor
rating
is
for
overreach
im
not
sure
it
was
worth
the
hotel
price
of
6
for
a
12
oz
glass
but
still
very
good
taste
is
strong
but
reminds
me
of
budweiser
rather
than
a
nice
craft
aroma
is
terrible
taste
isnt
much
better
c
hoppy
but
not
too
much
which
is
fine
because
it
lets
the
citrus
and
fruit
shine
ends
a
tad
bitter
for
my
druthers
but
this
is
still
a
good
brew
o
you
can
tell
whats
going
on
with
this
beer
when
fresh
though
the
hop
noise
has
simmered
down
this
might
be
more
interesting
with
hop
varieties
with
more
personality
with
as
much
hype
as
mosaic
has
gotten
why
choose
to
kinda
bury
it
in
a
malty
yeasty
wheat
beer
overall
i
dont
really
like
whats
going
on
here
its
a
pretty
standard
bland
boring
american
wheat
ale
with
a
generous
amount
of
hops
thrown
in
very
juicy
but
boring
mosaic
are
the
cool
new
thing
but
you
need
a
good
beer
behind
it
as
well
not
bad
just
not
good
sometimes
you
come
across
a
beer
that
is
so
simple
that
it
is
difficult
to
come
up
with
250
characters
to
complete
a
review
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
doesnt
mean
i
didnt
like
it
in
fact
i
did
it
simply
is
hard
to
write
much
the
nose
and
flavor
are
light
piney
hops
coupled
with
a
light
wheat
malt
pure
easy
simple
but
a
nice
drinking
beer
overall
a
solid
hoppy
wheat
ale
that
is
bitter
and
slightly
biting
in
the
mouthfeel
but
good
flavors
o
overall
a
decent
hoppy
wheat
but
i
think
i
was
hopping
for
a
little
more
from
the
mosaic
hops
in
this
one
but
to
be
fair
i
will
have
it
again
on
a
hot
sunny
day
i
was
gentle
with
ophelia
but
still
she
was
anxious
to
give
me
head
my
pour
netted
just
over
two
fingers
of
dense
tawny
head
with
great
retention
in
the
face
of
todays
humidity
color
was
a
cloudy
orangishyellow
srm
5

kind
of
like
freshlysqueezed
grapefruit
juice
ophelia
smelled
wonderful
citrusy
but
not
bitter
and
with
a
slight
sweetness
i
was
reminded
of
tangerines
or
orange
zest
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
the
taste
was
very
nice
it
had
a
semisweet
orange
tang
along
with
a
wheat
tartness
that
was
really
refreshing
finish
was
semidry
more
citrus
than
wheat
and
a
really
nice
drink
on
a
hot
humid
day
please
put
this
in
cans
the
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
herbal
hop
flavors
initially
and
light
orange
taste
with
a
mild
wheat
toastiness
and
slightly
grassy
hop
edge
with
gentle
tangy
yeast
combined
with
wheat
flavors
and
hint
of
spice
in
the
nutty
dry
finish
overall
i
enjoyed
this
it
is
drinkable
and
kind
of
like
a
white
ipa
but
it
has
more
wheat
with
a
mild
yeast
flavor
throughout
yeah
name
a
beer
after
that
particular
character
in
hamlet
nothing
iffy
there
nossir
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
partly
cloudy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
flowers
mixed
greens
powdered
sugar
honey
and
oats
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
zest
orange
peel
flowers
powdered
sugar
light
honey
and
some
mild
grass
that
sits
on
the
tongue
through
the
finish
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
meek
hoppy
wheat
one
where
the
hops
dont
really
blend
seamlessly
with
the
base
its
alright
at
best
o
overall
moderate
hoppiness
mildly
entertaining
but
not
enough
to
really
hold
your
attention
decent
but
forgetable
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid

something
hoppier
here
it
is
the
wheat
ale
backbone
is
a
sturdy
canvas
for
the
hoppy
character
of
this
beer
its
quite
hoppy
and
it
brings
notes
of
orange
a
vague
pepper
spice
grassy
notes
and
delicate
melon
too
this
is
backed
by
a
light
body
with
gently
crisp
carbonation
which
in
the
end
makes
this
a
pleasantly
made
beer
the
body
is
medium
pretty
hefty
for
whats
typical
and
semidry
all
the
way
as
hops
and
tangy
acidic
lemon
balance
in
the
feel
with
the
sweetness
its
crisp
to
the
point
of
being
sharp
and
carbonation
offers
a
soft
smoothness
as
well
overall
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
brew
it
was
very
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
with
a
nice
blend
of
hop
wheaty
malt
and
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
it
all
in
line
o
not
a
bad
choice
i
was
intrigued
by
the
cool
label
if
youre
looking
for
a
little
hop
bite
this
is
a
good
one
dry
citrus
burst
some
light
wheatness
at
the
most
pale
still
flavorful
malts
more
vegetablelike
notes
maybe
greens
or
carrot
a
unique
pale
wheat
carries
the
hoppiness
that
it
suggests
also
pushes
a
lot
of
sudsy
carb
good
spring
seasonal
poured
into
a
tulip
hazy
color
typical
for
a
wheat
beer
thin
foamy
head
with
slight
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
slight
piney
wheat
smell
pale
wheat
taste
with
slight
hop
bitterness
midway
through
the
drink
mild
bitter
aftertaste
wheat
taste
does
overpower
the
bitterness
a
bit
wheat
beer
was
my
first
love
when
it
came
to
craft
beers
but
i
have
become
more
of
a
hop
head
so
i
do
enjoy
the
combination
but
i
wish
it
was
more
hoppy
it
is
definitely
a
beer
i
can
enjoy
and
would
gladly
drink
again
o
excellent
beer
better
than
anticipated

i
am
a
fan
of
the
ophelia

can
compete
with

80acre
hoppy
wheat
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
unfiltered
yellow
with
virtually
no
head
and
no
lace
the
smell
was
a
good
mix
of
citrus
hops
and
wheat
the
taste
was
a
very
good
balance
of
bready
malt
and
citrus
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
would
certainly
try
it
again
home
tasting

drinks
very
easy
didnt
really
push
the
hops
forward
but
this
would
a
nice
summer
time
beer
around
here
i
found
it
at
cbc
belmont
serving
type
bottle
ok
worth
trying
they
call
this
a
hoppy
wheat
but
it
all
seemed
a
bit
subdued
to
me
barley
hazy
pale
yellow
liquid
and
a
thin
white
film
for
head
the
nose
is
wheat
malt
first
hops
second
not
overly
exciting
by
any
means
but
seemingly
well
crafted
and
light
enough
to
drink
a
bunch
of
nothing
about
this
really
pops
in
terms
of
flavor
good
ale
yeast
and
fresh
wheat
leave
a
mark
but
the
hops
arent
where
i
expected
them
to
be
after
reading
the
description
its
a
little
citrusty
but
the
fuller
wheat
body
covers
up
a
lot
of
the
hops
its
a
good
beer
with
food
as
its
plenty
full
flavored
but
it
lacks
an
exciting
or
distinguishing
element
to
me
clean
finish
good
bubbles
its
a
high
c
or
a
low
b
for
me
par
for
the
breckenridge
course
criticisms
may
be
that
the
wheat
beer
is
trying
to
be
too
much
of
an
ipa
but
perhaps
thats
what
this
style
should
become
this
was
so
good
completely
cloudy
it
poured
leaving
a
thick
head
which
moderately
quickly
became
a
solid
lace
the
smell
was
mainly
floral
but
there
was
definitely
citrus
complementing
it
the
taste
brought
out
the
big
citrusy
hop
goodness
it
was
mingled
with
pepper
and
floral
and
was
pretty
carbonated
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
and
regret
only
getting
one
overall
really
good
beer
espically
for
breckenridge
nice
flavors
good
balance
and
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
id
rather
be
drinking
this
during
the
summer
months
but
still
its
a
worthy
drink
for
the
winter
overall
incredibly
interesting
tasty
and
refreshing
abv

this
isnt
anything
too
special
but
its

its

a

back
to
the
breckenridge
effort
i
drank
a
beer
this
is
a
good
mellow
summer
beer
as
you
would
expect
very
easy
to
sip
and
before
you
know
it
youve
probably
had
a
few
out
on
the
patio
a
little
bit
fruity
but
not
a
typical
summer
wheat
beer
solid
mildly
sour
some
citrus
notes
not
overly
hopped
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
pours
a

overall
nice

flavor
and
malts

for

ale
from
breckenridge
brewery
if
the
aroma
wouldve

potent
i

it
wouldve
earned
a

it
sure
does
the
job
of
cooling
you
down
wetting

i
may
pick
this
brew
up

this

pretty

it
is
not

not
too
high
on

the

the

this
wont
take

of
any
of

session
beers
but
its
tasty
and
refreshing
though
simple
o
refreshing
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
summer
or
wheat
beers
this
is
one
of
the
ones
i
like
i
think
its
the
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
was
looking
for
something
relatively
light
today
and
this
fit
the
bill
more
or
less
nothing
to
write
home
about
or
repeat
this
is
a
pale
yellowgold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
subtle
wheat
scent
and
the
taste
has
a
faint
twang
no
real
hop
presence
but
there
is
a
little
fruit
and
a
slight
spice
and
flower
note
medium
to
light
in
mouthfeel
its
a
reasonable
summer
brew
nothing
outstanding
a
beer
with
summer
written
all
over
it
granted
its
in
the
name
this
is
a
lager
like
experience
its
attributes
are
straight
wheat
bread
cracker
and
dough
with
a
dry
refreshing
feel
this
style
is
never
overly
diverse
but
this
ale
is
strong
in
flavor
and
aroma
very
good
hot
weather
quencher
o
easy
summer
sipper
somewhere
between
shandy
and
wheat
ale
but
leaning
more
to
ale
side
just
short

this
beer
tasted
liked
a
bottle
400
pound
monkey
which
i
reviewed
but
not
nearly
as
bad
i
have
a
feeling
that
i
must
have
a
gotten
a
bad
bottle
of
both
because
the
smell
and
taste
is
really
strange
another
great
brew
from
lagunitas
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
very
crisp
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
way
too
hoppy
long
bitter
aftertaste
not
a
fan
one
of
my
favorites
of
lagunitas
delicious
sweet
tasting
very
refreshing
to
me
the
presence
of
wheat
malt
is
not
noticeable
to
the
taste
besides
the
yeasty
sweetness
that
characterizes
beers
like
hefeweizeninstead
the
wheat
comes
across
in
the
overall
lightness
of
the
beer
what
is
actually
a
pretty
strong
brew
feels
airy
and
light
with
little
alcohol
taste
nice
foamy
head
that
settle
nicely
color
is
a
beautiful
hay
yellow
with
consistent
bubbling
to
the
head
smell
is
slight
floral
and
fruit
notes
taste
is
outstanding
very
hoppy
as
it
should
be
with
a
combination
of
fruits
honey
and
floral
aspects
finish
and
mouth
feel
are
slightly
bitter
but
not
off
putting
very
impressive
something
my
roommate
brought
home
im
all
for
hops
but
this
is
something
else
6
types
in
one
beer
is
interesting
tastes
of
honey
straw
and
wheat
along
with
citrus
and
floral
notes
it
smells
of
the
same
the
is
a
very
refreshing
all
purpose
beer
which
is
deceivingly
complex
this
is
a
nice
drinking
beer
poured
into
tulip
glass
a
beautiful
orange
with
fluffy
white
bubbles
to
the
rim
settles
nicely
with
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
incredible
bouquet
of
floral
and
piney
hops
with
a
crackers
and
light
ester
notes
taste
is
resiny
hops
tangerines
cut
grass
with
a
semi
sweet
breadiness
to
give
a
balanced
flavor
and
mediumlight
body
to
this
beer
nice
crisp
carbonation
and
excellent
drinkability
i
would
get
this
again
for
sure
light
amber
color
pleasant
smell
floral
and
fruity
aftertaste
one
of
my
favorite
beers
malty
yet
clean
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
this
was
my
first
lagunitas
and
it
is
still
my
favorite
overall
good
beer
lagunitas
cant
wait
to
try
more
of
what
you
got
overall
a
nice
brew
fantastic
excellent
across
the
board
not
to
be
missed
overall
has
the
best
features
of
a
wheat
beer
and
an
ipa
well
balanced
sweetness
with
hoppy
bitterness
great
beer
there
is
so
much
going
on
with
this
ale
i
cant
even
explain
it
a
little
bit
of
everything
which
is
a
good
thing
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
really
great
flavor
wonderfully
balanced
very
drinkable
and
will
kick
your
butt
if
you
have
too
many
the
wheat
marries
beautifully
with
the
citrusforward
hops
keeping
that
resinous
piney
note
so
pervasive
within
this
style
in
check
while
adding
some
bready
texture
to
the
midpalate
finishes
dry
but
with
a
smooth
honeyed
feel
great
balance
o
a
really
great
ale
that
straddles
the
line
between
a
hoppy
pale
wheat
ale
and
a
wheatbased
ipa
this
one
is
definitely
worth
seeking
out
on
a
warm
day
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
nice
golden
display
crisp
flavor
nothing
bad
to
say
overall
a
fantastic
beer
highly
recommended
o
being
a
new
brunswicker
i
travel
to
the
state
of
maine
as
often
as
i
can
to
seek
out
some
great
beer
thats
not
available
at
home
and
i
consider
myself
extremely
fortunate
to
have
come
across
a
sixer
of
lagunitas
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
in
a
hannaford
easily
one
of
the
best
apas
ive
had
and
this
one
is
even
wheat
extremely
easy
to
drink
even
at
7
5
abv
it
will
be
hard
to
measure
up
to
this
one
for
sure
i
have
to
say
thanks
to
my
buddy
matt
for
recommending
this
beer
the
bottle
calls
this
an
ale
but
its
really
a
sweet
ipa
all
day
long
and
amazingly
drinkable
the
fact
that
this
is
available
yearround
probably
makes
this
my
new
goto
beer
love
it
this
is
easily
one
of
my
top
five
goto
beers
and
its
a
luxury
that
its
so
readily
available
beer
this
good
is
usually
hard
to
find
i
love
that
it
zings
hops
like
a
double
ipa
but
is
not
heavy
on
the
malt
easy
to
drink
without
feeling
like
you
ate
a
loaf
of
bread
great
beer
id
like
to
know
what
happened
ive
had
this
before
and
it
tasted
like
an
ipa
this
clearly
is
not
an
ipa
i
checked
the
lagu
website
its
a
wheat
ale
with
hops
added
what
was
i
drinking
before
poured
from
bottle
to
nonic
appearance
is
a
clear
pale
golden
with
white
thick
frothy
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
immediately
get
floral
and
citrus
aromas
with
a
hint
of
bread
flavors
are
similar
with
medium
sweetness
from
a
fruit
note
and
a
lightly
bitter
grassy
taste
mouthfeel
is
lively
with
a
soapy
texture
and
a
mild
but
lingering
bitter
finish

i

right
away
but
as
i
kept
drinking
it
i
really
liked
it
28
mo
dailey
draft
chicago
very
good
ipa
offering
by
lagunitas
nice
blend
of
taste
and
strength
went
down
smooth
had
a
few
when
all
was
said
and
done
and
i
look
forward
to
having
this
beer
again
down
the
road
overall
this
is
a
beer
you
go
to
for
a
nice
refreshing
and
full
flavored
beer
amazing
beer
lagunitas
is
great
as
usual
not
a
fan
of
bitter
beers
this
one
reminded
me
of
carrots
however
take
the
bitterness
away
and
its
a
great
beer
thats
good
news
for
bitter
beer
lovers
ooverall
i
will
say
that
this
is
an
excellent
beer
it
is
so
refreshing
so
make
sure
you
drink
it
very
cold
and
also
pour
it
into
a
worthy
glass
the
glass
allows
any
beers
characteristics
to
shine
through
and
this
beer
is
amazing
the
color
is
much
lighter
and
more
of
a
yellowgolden
than
other
ipas
that
i
have
reviewed
like
rebel
rouser
from
sam
adams
and
rampant
ipa
by
new
belgium
those
beers
are
amazing
too
but
this
one
is
different
because
it
focuses
on
the
floral
and
piney
citrus
flavors
more
than
other
ipas
a
great
beer
with
a
great
hop
taste
with
some
subtle
citus
notes
and
a
nice
bitterness
one
of
my
favorites
indeed
pours
clear
gold
no
foreshadowing
of
whats
to
come
aroma
has
a
sharp
distinctive
perfumemedicinal
bent
strangely
reminiscent
of
my
girlfriends
house
though
i
have
a
strong
olfactory
sense
this
aroma
does
not
translate
the
taste
is
semisweet
with
caramel
and
wheat
flavors
i
have
no
idea
what
style
this
brew
indicates
per
usual
from
lagunitas
but
its
delicious
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
pours
a
semitransparent
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
smells
of
citrus
zest
tropical
fruits
and
flowers
with
a
touch
of
pepper
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
some
added
hints
of
apple
its
also
a
tad
spicy
and
slightly
bitter
the
malt
is
there
but
very
faint
its
crisp
refreshing
and
not
boozy
at
all
especially
considering
the
high
abv
for
8
99
a
6
pk
this
is
too
good
to
be
true
awesome
smell
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
stated
67
ibus
on
the
bottle
but
the
bitterness
largely
dissappeares
in
the
cloying
sweetness
not
to
my
liking
quite
hoppy
for
a
wheat
ale
but
i
expect
and
like
that
from
lagunitas
this
beer
is
more
towards
a
orange
citrus
ipa
treat
but
with
some
wheat
that
is
there
but
not
full
front
and
center
its
delicious
and
smells
wonderful
out
of
a
mason
jar
with
jimi
hendrix
spinning
under
a
needle
this
is
just
great
beer
something
refreshingly
different
it
may
be
a
little
sweet
for
some
but
for
me
it
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
just
enough
hoppy
bitterness
to
react
well
with
the
sweet
flavor
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
lagunitas
so
far
it
hides
the
7
5
abv
almost
to
well
i
didnt
like
it
and
i
think
94
is
a
silly
score
hows
that
not
being
a
hop
head
i
was
a
bit
concerned
about
this
one
but
i
found
it
a
nice
beer
there
is
a
very
definite
hops
presence
there
but
not
to
the
point
of
dominating
the
beer
so
much
that
they
are
all
you
can
taste
it
kind
of
bridges
the
gap
between
a
full
on
ipa
and
something
less
hoppy
i
am
still
not
a
hop
head
but
this
is
one
hops
heavy
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
not
good
does
not
taste
like
beer
would
rather
drink
pink
wine
this
beer
is
beautiful
hands
down
favorite
lagunitas
brew
this
ice
cold
beer
hit
high
marks
on
all
aspects
of
this
review
great
brew
through
and
through
im
not
normally
a
fan
of
very
hoppy
beers
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
flavor
and
crisp
bite
you
can
smell
the
layers
of
hops
right
from
the
start
but
the
sharp
taste
makes
this
an
excellent
beer
medium
hop
smells
more
citrusy
and
spicy
not
alcohol
smell
which
is
surprising
for
higher
level
little
too
citrusy
of
a
hop
for
me
need
more
of
a
smooth
aftertaste
rather
than
grapefruit
notes
enjoyable
beer
overall
o
very
drinkable
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
beer
overall
it
drinks
well
not
overly
carbonated
nice
mouth
feel
not
too
filling
good
beer
its
definitely
a
different
wheat
beer
working
off
old
notes
will
update
with
more
details
ifwhen
i
have
another
great
beer
my
new
fav
beer
a
really
solid
wheat
ale
with
some
complexity
and
quite
intense
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
the
floral
aroma
is
amazing
and
the
hoppy
entrance
quickly
turns
into
a
slightly
bitter
finish
overall
a
great
beer
one
of
my
favorites
grapefuit
is
the
major
note
but
pretty
light
and
balanced
with
some
dry
fruit
and
distant
malt
refreshing
and
more
complex
than
most
wheat
beer
loved
the
aromas
of
berries
and
floral
tones
right
in
my
wheelhouse
the
taste
does
pair
with
the
smell
very
well
bitter
hops
that
fades
to
smooth
crisp
finish
not
overly
sweet
which
helps
in
the
fact
that
im
able
to
drink
a
few
at
a
time
and
not
get
sick
of
the
beer
overall
it
is
a
beer
i
like
to
keep
in
the
frig
on
a
regular
basis
if
i
can
find
it
very
good
lagunitas
overall
one
of
the
best
hoppy
wheats
ive
had
and
substantially
better
than
the
overhyped
gumballhead
highly
recommended
v
medium
just
a
beer
nothing
too
outstanding
about
it
the
scores
on
this
say
it
all
very
good
for
when
youre
looking
for
something
heavy
that
is
affordable
well
made
and
really
drinkable
drink
sumpin
ale
its
just
spot
on
for
providing
a
nice
hop
aroma
without
overwhelming
a
really
clean
malt
flavor
the
body
is
just
fabulous
as
is
the
abv
i
dont
find
it
boozy
either
its
really
well
balanced
love
it
makes
my
top
5
list
now
that
i
am
in
the
southwestern
us
ive
been
looking
for
an
alternative
to
peak
organic
summer
ale
which
i
love
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
was
looking
for
i
will
grab
another
six
and
try
it
again
i
will
still
keep
searching
for
something
similar
to
the
peak
organic
though
the
smell
of
spiced
fruit
and
orange
peel
follow
immediately
into
the
flavor
up
front
that
turns
into
a
great
smooth
but
dry
bitter
finish
another
from
lagunitas
that
doesnt
disappoint
a
beautiful
looking
pale
ale
golden
yellow
translucent
body
with
a
minimal
egg
white
head
pine
hops
punch
through
other
cleansoapy
smells
hinting
at
a
very
refreshing
brew
tastes
of
lemon
orange
and
pear
juices
possibly
some
biscuity
malts
there
but
piney
hops
overtake
the
taste
buds
before
theres
any
chance
of
balance
feels
light
and
refreshing
subtle
carbonated
and
somewhat
creamy
overall
one
of
the
most
refreshing
wheat
beers
ive
had
but
not
enough
hopmalt
balance
for
my
liking
i
was
hoping
the
malts
would
come
out
towards
the
end
as
citrusy
hops
dominated
everything
but
no
dice
still
little
sumpin
is
one
tasty
lagunitas
brew
worth
trying
crisp
refreshing
drink
it
if
you
want
a
pleasing
late
winter
warmer
wife
has
a
90
minute
every
night
i
picked
up
this
ca
beer
in
miami
last
week
and
super
clean
nice
ibus
and
abv
hate
to
type
it
but
a
mini
90
min
ipa
tonight
i
am
sticking
to
founders
dirty
bastard
centennial
and
breakfast
stout
happy
new
years
an
above
average
ipa
bitter
with
strong
hop
notes
due
to
the
abv
count
it
packs
a
punch
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
from
lagunitas
as
well
who
i
am
quite
the
fan
of
i
tried
this
for
the
first
time
on
thanksgiving
and
drank
it
with
my
brother
in
law
and
we
both
absolutely
loved
this
brew
and
have
since
bought
it
again
way
to
hoppy
for
a
wheat
the
perfect
beer
to
my
taste
buds
almost
like
drinking
dank
smooth
and
hoppy
a
nice
but
different
ipa
poured
on
tap
at
the
abbey
brewing
co
in
miami
bronze
colored
nice
foamy
head
very
bitter
great
focused
taste
didnt
know
what
kind
of
ale
this
was
supposed
to
be
when
i
bought
it
first
whiff
and
i
said
oh
a
light
ipa
then
i
tasted
it
what
the
heck
this
aint
no
ipa
is
it
could
it
be
a
wheat
beer
but
i
dont
really
like
wheat
beers
an
orange
pineapple
piney
sweetness
came
through
that
was
unexpected
and
fantastic
hops
are
there
but
really
balanced
with
the
other
flavors
this
beer
is
complex
smooth
and
extremely
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
more
than
just
the
single
i
bought
definitely
buying
more
of
this
soon
delicious
i
always
try
to
make
sure
i
have
this
beer
in
my
fridge
year
round
o
overall
an
amazing
almost
too
drinkable

with

this
is
a

definitely
drink
on
a

very
good
beer
overall
i
only
had
one
and
really
wanted
another
i
dont
know
if
id
want
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
i
will
add
it
to
my
regular
rotation
overall
the
flavors
dont
seem
to
mesh
very
well
the
citruslike
flavors
and
bitterness
seem
very
stark
on
the
other
hand
it
has
the
intense
hop
character
of
an
ipa
with
a
discernible
malt
influence
which
comes
across
as
soft
and
breadlike
the
hops
are
citrusy
and
bitter
siding
with
grapefruit
lemon
and
lime
without
the
rounding
influence
of
some
sweeter
tarter
orange
etc
i
wish
there
where
more
ales
like
these
very
hoppy
aroma
but
is
surprisingly
smooth
on
flavor
herby
flavors
but
not
overwhelming
excellent
balance
is
all
i
have
to
say
about
this
brew
i
love
this
beer
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
wheat
beers
and
the
addition
of
delicious
hops
makes
for
a
total
homerun
perfect
beer
in
my
opinion
nose
is
wonderful
rich
sharp
hop
aroma
with
a
bit
of
wheat
flavor
is
on
point
buttery
smooth
hop
and
wheat
flavors
are
so
good
in
combination
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
a
real
gem
from
lagunitas
love
me
some
sumpin
sumpin
excellent
beer
will
absolutely
seek
out
and
purchase
again
cant
put
it
in
a
box
nor
can
you
surmise
its
greatness
by
trying
to
define
the
pale
wheatipa
characteristics
that
embody
this
brew
slightly
fizzy
yellow
an
inch
of
clouds
and
minimal
lace
comprise
the
nonic
pint
that
allows
me
to
see
the
girth
of
my
fingers
on
the
other
side
the
smell
is
delicious
reminiscent
of
cameron
diaz
in
her
younger
years
yet
that
is
another
story
hmm
banana
chips
forest
sap
and
honey
pervade
my
senses
and
invite
me
to
delve
further
into
this
temporary
escape
from
reality
the
taste
is
superb
i
suppose
this
is
a
hybrid
because
if
mother
wheat
had
a
love
child
with
the
four
cs
it
would
result
in
this
brilliant
yet
complex
bubblegum
hops
offering
body
is
medium
and
warms
with
additional
surprises
of
grapefruit
and
peach
on
the
tongue
every
now
and
then
we
step
outside
of
our
zone
and
find
a
beer
that
surprises
us
for
me
this
was
one
of
those
times
the
ipa
hunter
gives
this
an
overall
rating
of
larrrrrrge
if
you
like
gumballhead
give
this
a
shot
not
a
hop
head
dont
let
the
ibus
scare
you
off
the
hops
arent
overwhelming
grapefruit
awesome
beer
hoppy
and
sour
fruity
hard
to
believe
its
a
wheat
beer
actually
fun
to
drink
pours
a
light
amber
with
an
off
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
hops
with
a
grapefruit
scent
being
the
strongest
the
beer
itself
has
many
layers
to
the
flavors
grapefruit
and
pine
notes
from
the
hops
mingle
well
with
sweet
fruit
and
spice
from
the
malt
the
flavor
was
well
balanced
and
quite
tasty
a
favorite
for
sure
rjt
overall
try
it
for
yourself
and
see
there
are
beers
that
stand
out
more
this
one
has
its
own
character
but
would
be
one
i
could
point
to
someone
trying
to
get
into
the
style
but
not
sure
if
they
really
like
it
or
not
this
is
a
beer
i
would
also
drink
as
a
fan
of
ipas
i
have
drank
a
lot
of
intense
beers
this
isnt
one
of
them
its
just
well
made
and
tasty
more
hoppy
than
i
thought
id
like
becoming
a
favorite
for
those
hotter
evenings
while
kicking
back
in
the
back
yard
sumpin
special
i
lokit
a
lot
overall
impression
very
enjoyable
an
ipa
drinker
can
turn
this
into
a
session
be
careful
o
one
of
my
go
to
beers
dangerously
drinkable
good
party
beer
super
solid
recommend
o
nicely
hopped
but
still
well
balanced
not
much
more
to
say
but
this
is
one
ill
be
turning
to
again
for
sure
a
great
experience
start
to
finish
excellent
o
i
had
this
about
a
year
ago
and
dont
remember
it
being
this
good
lagunitas
keeps
getting
better
overall
not
much
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
more
of
a
double
hoppy
wheat
i
guess
it
tastes
great
just
miscategorized
i
believe
the
only
beer
from
lagunitas
that
totally
understands
me
o
this
blew
my
socks
off
its
definitely
a
west
coast
hop
forward
apaapwaipa
or
however
people
want
to
categorize
it
it
has
a
very
nice
grapefruit
sweetness
that
comes
on
first
followed
with
a
slightly
bitter
wash
that
then
fades
into
citrusy
sweetness
again
the
alcohol
is
also
completely
hidden
and
it
does
go
down
easily
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
drank
one
the
other
day
just
because
it
was
in
the
fridge
and
then
another
repeat
until
the
floor
looks
wobbly
damn
thats
good
and
i
dont
even
like
wheat
beer
this
smells
at
least
fairly
fresh
somewhat
vibrant
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
plus
muted
wheat
underneath
the
hops
dont
come
across
as
fresh
on
the
tongue
but
this
is
still
damn
tasty
pungent
grapefruit
plus
hints
of
pineapple
and
mango
all
but
overwhelm
any
malt
balance
the
body
was
big
and
sticky
definitely
liking
this
one
give
me
a
bottled
on
date
and
this
would
be
a
regular
buy
for
me
this
is
my
kinda
wheat
beer
hoppy
with
a
slightly
resiny
and
bready
finish
really
good
its
really
great
wheat
hops
fruit
it
has
it
all
and
its
just
great
pretty
close
to
perfection
to
me
an
amazing
fruity
apa
better
than
gumballhead
in
my
opinion
and
im
a
three
floyds
fan
boy
im
glad
indiana
has
what
seems
to
be
an
endless
supply
of
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
a
o
i
love
this
beer
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
want
more
of
it
the
hop
bomb
of
an
ipa
the
refreshing
character
of
a
hefe
the
drinkability
of
a
light
lager
this
is
so
money
o
really
liked
this
beer
i
can
see
what
they
mean
when
they
say
it
is
hard
to
categorize
poured
a
nice
clear
light
orange
body
with
a
half
finger
foamy
white
head
it
looks
quite
nice
very
inviting
scents
of
earthy

hints
of
tropical
fruit
mostly
mango
a
bit
of
pine
resin
a
hint
of
orange
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
overall
impression
of
aroma
is
a
nicely
hop
forward
aroma
that
has
most
all
of
the
typical
west
coast
aromas
on
display
quite
nice
flavor
begins
with
a
nice
vegetal
hop
flavor
mingling
with
pine
resin
and
a
bit
of
indeterminate
citrus
bitterness
is
moderate
this
moves
into
a
middle
with
notes
of
orange
zest
and
flesh
and
a
touch
of
alcohol

is
mediumdry

overall

lets
a
bit
of
the
wheat
malt
shine
through
very
nice
mouthfeel

resinous
and
slightly
chewy
with
a
nicely

feel
with

overall
impression
is
of
a
good
smooth
resinous
mouthfeel
that
is
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
nice
hoppy
wheat
ale
that
is
very
pleasant
in
aroma
and
flavor
and
is
aided
by
a
nice
mouthfeel
it
is
quite

really

everybody
always
likes

amazing
tastes
good
another
unique
sumpin
o
this
is
my
first
beer
from
lagunitas
ive
heard
a
lot
about
them
but
theyve
just
recently
become
easy
to
find
in
delaware
part
of
me
was
hoping
for
this
to
taste
like
more
of
a
wheat
beer
than
an
ipa
but
im
not
sure
that
i
really
care
either
way
its
got
some
really
nice
malt
and
hop
aroma
and
flavors
and
goes
down
smooth
what
else
could
you
ask
for
recommended
taste
like
flowers
beer
flowers
interesting
half
wheat
half
ipa
very
tasty
yummmm
serving
type
bottle
a
high
hopped
beer
with
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
to
me
it
has
a
citrus
aroma
and
overall
fruity
flavors
although
the
fact
that
its
a
bit
sweet
and
has
a
solid
amount
of
hops
likely
is
the
cause
for
this
description
its
taste
is
not
particularly
balanced
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
it
really
is
a
fine
refreshment
worth
savoring
perhaps
not
worthy
of
world
fame
but
definitely
something
i
would
want
in
my
cup
a
very
drinkable
hoppy
wheat
beer
excellent
taste
good
all
around
beer
overall
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
wheat
beer
at
first
it
tastes
like
a
lot
of
american
pale
ales
but
the
thickness
and
malt
backbone
set
it
apart
recomended
by
my
local
beer
guy
as
a
must
try
he
was
right
again
good
beer
very
drinkable
complex
falvors
yes
will
reapeat
chicago
can
they
be
added
to
the
best
beer
in
the
midwest
list
in
nyc
i
have
found
the
taste
quality
of
this
beer
to
have
a
pretty
high
variation
when
my
brother
was
visiting
nyc
from
petaluma
ca
we
got
one
of
the
notsogreat
six
packs
from
a
super
market
prompting
the
dreaded
criticism
of
it
doesnt
taste
as
good
out
here
stores
that
have
a
high
turnover
like
a
whole
foods
beer
store
or
specialty
beer
stores
are
your
best
bet
for
a
relatively
fresh
batch
with
this
beer
freshness
means
everything
with
the
opening
of
the
chicago
brewing
site
hopefully
those
of
us
on
the
east
coast
can
expect
to
see
a
steadier
stream
of
fresh
lagunitas
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
favorite
beer
of
the
summer
refreshingly
bitter
with
fruity
american
hops
and
a
tight
clear
head
as
well
as
fantastic
clarity
a
little
hearty
as
well
which
is
a
pro
for
me
tried
this
based
on
ba
positive
ratings
first
one
was
shockingly
floral
and
grassy
second
one
was
much
better
and
after
that
very
good
i
guess
my
point
is
its
an
acquired
taste
o
a
very
tasty
beer
that
has
that
good
ol
lagunitas
hop
character
however
something
about
this
beer
maybe
the
mild
carbonation
really
struck
me
as
being
similar
to
homebrews
i
have
tried
nonetheless
a
great
summertime
compromise
between
fruity
hops
and
fruity
wheat
o
a
good
beer
but
not
a
apwa
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
but
not
sure
that
ill
be
going
back
for
the
price
it
cost
i
read
the
beer
advocate
description
for
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
it
says
its
an
americanized
version
of
a
hefe
weizen
that
gets
me
interested
you
know
what
i
dont
want
to
call
this
an
ipa
any
more
since
i
dont
like
ipa
that
much
sign
my
name
on
the
petition
for
apwa
there
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweetness
and
hoppiness
in
this
beer
it
has
a
very
nice
nose
gotta
love
what
they
put
on
their
bottles
i
am
curious
they
state
that
the
beer
has
64
20
for
international
bitterness
units
ibus
is
it
acidityph
how
is
that
tested
original
gravity
and
alcohol
by
volume
is
certainly
easy
to
test
o
granted
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
american
pale
wheat
style
i
can
appreciate
when
a
brewery
has
a
good
beer
in
that
style
and
this
is
indeed
a
good
brew
such
a
great
brewery
and
a
very
nice
offering
on
a
bright
sunny
day
this
is
one
of
the
best
in
this
style
o
a
fantastic
ipa
50
wheat
malt
adds
mouthfeel
and
head
retention
without
distracting
from
hop
flavor
a
crisp
clean
bitter
fruity
ipa
that
is
perfect
for
warm
weather
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
not
bad
well
hidden
abv
with
an
interesting
and
intense
balance
of
hops
and
malts
ultimately
not
my
favorite
profile
after
i
drank
the
first
few
sips
of
this
is
tasted
really
hoppy
but
in
a
good
way
fairly
floral
good
thick
taste
hard
to
describe
but
even
though
it
is
not
the
same
type
of
beer
it
really
tasted
like
a
beer
that
i
had
last
week
in
california
pliney
the
elder
the
taste
was
about
80
similar
so
if
you
want
something
that
tastes
similar
but
live
in
texas
like
i
do
go
buy
some
little
sumpin
to
satisfy
your
pliney
the
elder
needs
o
good
beer
balanced
well
not
too
hoppy
or
malty
m
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
finishes
quite
dry
i
really
love
how
different
this
is
it
has
the
fresh
citrus
and
pine
notes
of
an
ipa
with
smooth
mellow
undertones
of
orange
peel
and
vanilla
it
feels
like
an
ipa
and
wheat
beer
working
together
and
it
is
such
a
good
combination
the
overall
product
is
fresh
and
citrusy
with
a
smooth
creamy
finish
i
plan
on
buying
this
again
very
soon
i
discovered
this
beer
several
years
ago
and
was
enamoured
id
never
had
such
a
suculent
tasting
ipa
before
i
was
a
regular
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
guy
which
is
my
everyday
and
the
flavour
here
was
a
wake
up
call
for
me
i
love
this
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
had
and
i
will
grab
it
without
hesitation
from
the
shelf
and
like
most
products
from
lagunitas
i
have
enjoyed
its
subtlety
beautiful
flavor
and
consistency
every
time
i
buy
it
if
you
ever
have
anyone
offer
this
to
you
at
a
gathering
or
whatever
they
deserve
a
kiss
right
on
the
mouth
per
lydia
loveless
and
hopefully
she
looks
like
the
varga
girl
on
the
label
overall
a
very
interesting
and
delicious
beer
that
is
both
wheaty
and
hoppy
a
top
among
the
apwa
style
for
sure
as
my
first
lagunitas
beer
i
was
impressed
a
must
try
for
those
seeking
a
tasty
and
potent
warm
weather
brew
fucking
dank
as
shit
beer
this
beer
just
did
not
appeal
to
my
tastes
i
typically
like
very
hoppy
beer
but
this
beer
was
just
a
mixed
up
mess
of
hops
tastes
bitterness
and
flavors
compared
to
other
high
quality
pale
ales
and
ipa
this
is
just
average
at
best
i
think
they
tried
hard
but
failed
o
refreshing
and
tasty
brew
for
9
a
sixer
its
worth
buying
any
day
great
alternative
to
typical
west
coast
ipa
good
beer
worthy
if
repeating
fresh
bottle
poured
into
my
snifter
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
2
finger
head
that
quickly
dropped
to
1
and
then
just
some
nice
lacing
aroma
of
grapefruit
and
pine
taste
was
very
clean
big
notes
of
pine
somewhat
astringent
perhaps
with
some
citrus
to
boot
tasted
quite
like
it
smelled
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
back
end
but
we
are
talking
about
a
7
5
beer
so
no
hard
feelings
overall
this
was
very
good
probably
not
a
daily
go
to
though
i
would
really
like
to
see
how
it
tastes
on
draft
pinybityfloraly
this
is
a
standard
in
my
area
i
have
consumed
so
much
of
it
i
had
to
take
a
few
months
off
i
love
this
ale
stands
up
with
any
ipa
even
though
it
is
not
considered
an
ipa
it
can
be
found
most
everywhere
in
the
country
and
is
very
fairly
priced
no
need
to
go
into
a
long
description
if
you
have
not
tried
it
do
it
now

out
a

bitter
at
first

the

is
nice

this
brew
is
different
from
most
brews
on
the
market
this
is
not
your
everyday
drinking
brew
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
of
5
overall
an
exceptional
beer
that
is
excellent
to
drink
glass
shaker
pint
overall
a
3
for
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
from
lagunitas
brewing
company
i
was
disappointed
to
say
the
least
ill
have
to
give
it
another
chance
but
for
now
its
not
hitting
the
spot
for
me
o
a
refreshing
unique
simple
beer
that
goes
down
way
too
easy
for
something
that
tastes
so
good
one
of
my
summer
go
to
beers
bright
golden
colored
with
excellent
clarity
a
half
inch
off
eggshell
white
head
pungent
aroma
of
tropical
and
citrus
hops
in
the
forefronti
taste
plenty
of
citrus
hops
with
the
tropical
hops
and
pale
wheat
playing
more
of
a
background
note
there
back
of
the
palate
is
fading
pungent
hops
giving
way
to
pale
wheat
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
refreshing
o
complex
fruity
and
floral
beer
very
interesting
and
worth
trying
my
favourite
in
this
style
so
far
overall
i
had
this
beer
with
some
blackend
grilled
chicken
and
it
was
the
perfect
match
i
think
this
should
be
my
diet
for
a
week
just
have
to
find
more
lagunitas
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
by
lagunitas
it
has
all
the
aroma
hops
of
an
ipa
without
a
harsh
bittering
charge
a
perfect
example
of
an
apa
perfect
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
hops
i
like
that
the
wheat
doesnt
take
over
the
flavor
but
plays
well
with
the
other
ingredients
well
done
good
deceived
me
at
first
smells
like
a
single
ipa
but
once
you
take
your
first
sip
you
realize
its
a
pale
ale
not
a
huge
fan
of
pale
ales
but
this
was
good
would
i
purchase
this
beer
again
most
likely
not
but
thats
mainly
because
i
do
not
care
for
the
pale
ale
style
would
i
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
does
enjoy
pale
ales
hell
yes
o
4
25
the
aroma
is
just
great
but
the
flavors
dont
quite
match
up
a
very
good
beer
but
with
lagunitas
there
are
better
options
m
medlight
body
carbonation
provides
a
zip
to
it
well
blended
beer
overall
i
got
no
wheat
smell
or
taste
at
all
this
is
really
more
of
an
ipa
then
a
wheat
beer
o
another
ipa
that
is
common
around
these
parts
and
easily
accessible
worth
the
price
and
definitely
one
of
those
go
to
ipas
in
the
6
pack
format
refreshing
not
world
class
but
is
consistent
the
appearance
and
smell
are
soso
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
definitely
make
up
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
arent
those
the
most
important
aspects
of
a
beer
as
far
as
hoppy
wheats
go
the
ibu
is
just
a
tad
too
high
for
me
and
at
7
5
its
a
little
too
alcoholic
to
make
it
sessionable
though
you
really
cant
taste
the
alcohol
i
feel
this
is
suited
more
toward
ipa
fanatics
rather
than
wheat
connoisseurs
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
are
great
overall
this
a
very
good
beer
and
especially
suited
for
summer
just
be
careful
how
many
you
drink
youll
feel
it
before
you
know
it
believe
the
hype
my
go
to
lagunitas
hits
it
out
of
the
park
with
sumpin
it
has
citrus
its
slightly
bitter
its
refreshing
its
great
with
spicy
food
i
love
the
label
design
of
anything
flying
dog
and
sumpin
by
lagunitas
is
a
great
looking
label
throwback
pinup
girl
is
asking
you
if
you
want
to
take
a
sip
and
you
do
shes
naughty
and
knows
you
like
that
i
put
this
beer
up
against
almost
anything
best
part
is
that
its
available
all
the
time
the
hype
isnt
a
limited
availability
marketingsnob
thing
only
mark
i
have
against
it
is
the
difference
in
pricing
locally
i
see
it
at
albersons
for
14
99
a
sixer
but
can
pick
it
up
at
my
favorite
ma
and
pa
liquor
store
for
9
99
solid
beer
caramel
notes
jump
out
to
me
light
buttery
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
buy
again
probably
wouldnt
brag
about
it
though
thought
this
might
be
too
hoppy
for
me
based
on
the
ibu
but
this
is
the
most
well
balanced
hoppy
beer
ive
had
great
all
around
i
can
see
why
this
beer
gets
the
reviews
it
does
too
bad
its
not
available
where
i
live
glad
i
got
to
try
it
excellent
brew
o
hop
heads
especially
chinook
heads
will
love
this
beer
i
appreciate
it
not
my
style
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
this
beer
once
was
in
the
top
250
how
it
dropped
off
i
have
no
idea
this
beer
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
ales
ive
tasted
i
dont
want
to
compare
it
to
sucks
but
they
are
somewhat
similar
it
has
a
misty
golden
look
nice
hoppy
ale
taste
i
love
the
label
of
the
bottle
old
fashion
looking
cheers
pours
a
clear
lightamber
to
straw
color
with
a
thick
two
finger
cap
and
heavy
retention
i
didnt
pick
up
the
wheat
characteristics
i
was
expecting
on
this
one
lots
of
citrusy
hops
with
a
slight
malt
presence
i
picked
up
the
wheat
flavor
after
around
my
third
sip
about
two
minutes
after
my
pour
the
wheat
presence
lingered
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
while
all
the
hops
danced
around
moderate
and
pleasant
carbonation
throughout
the
beer
definitely
a
sneaky
7

a
very
well
balance
beer
overall
nice
for
a
warm
day
poured
a
nice
clear
honey
gold
with
a
thin
but
lasting
head
nice
lacing
smells
fresh
hoppy
and
of
pink
grapefruit
tastes
of
grapefruit
tangerine
and
pine
and
a
trace
of
wheat
my
wife
picked
up
wheat
on
the
nose
as
well
every
so
often
i
taste
a
little
of
the
alcohol
but
it
is
well
masked
overall
a
very
good
wheat
ale
thanks
again
for
the
taste
bob
a
golden
very
clear
looks
like
a
good
strong
ale
or
lager
s
definitely
the
low
light
of
this
beer
get
some
sweet
bready
smell
and
some
floral
notes
up
front
but
it
then
turns
to
an
almost
sour
urine
smell
sorry
but
thats
what
im
getting
here
t
up
front
has
a
familiar
ale
or
strong
lager
taste
clean
and
wheaty
getting
a
real
bready
malty
sweetness
at
the
back
of
my
mouth
finishes
very
bitter
m
pretty
light
good
carbonation
pretty
dry
from
all
the
hops
bite
o
why
did
i
wait
so
long
to
give
this
a
shot
its
a
good
ale
with
some
real
hops
bite
overall
this
is
my
favorite
hoppy
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
i
think
the
balance
between
the
slightly
sweet
malt
background
fruity
hop
flavors
and
strong
but
not
overpower
bitterness
is
perfect
i
could
drink
this
all
day
overall
a
nicely
balanced
refreshing
beer
with
very
interesting
and
nicely
done
hops
although
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
i
liked
it
definitely
palatable
to
a
malt
head
like
me
nice
golden
yellow
color
perhaps
ever
so
slightly
orange
head
was
white
and
thick
but
dissipated
down
to
a
small
soapy
top
hops
in
the
nose
smells
of
orange
peel
and
a
bitter
something
hay
grass
closer
to
grass
yum
fruity
on
the
tongue
again
orange
is
there
almost
an
orange
soda
vibe
going
to
it
there
is
a
bitter
tackiness
as
well
some
pepper
nice
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
hop
bitterness
but
it
is
there
the
fruity
orange
flavor
offsets
it
well
a
beer
you
can
sit
and
relax
with
and
you
wouldnt
grow
tired
of
light
and
fizzy
in
the
mouth
this
is
exactly
how
i
would
hope
a
beer
that
tastes
this
way
would
feel
in
the
mouth
a
delight
a
beer
you
can
sit
and
relax
with
something
you
wouldnt
grow
tired
of
easy
drinking
love
it
poured
into
a
plnt
glass
golden
wheat
color
with
little
head
but
the
taste
was
indescribable
and
irrestistable
and
it
could
makes
me
drink
over
and
over
again
a
wonderful
beer
from
a
unique
brewery
this
one
is
surely
worth
trying
two
thumbs
up
o
probably
not
a
repeat
the
bitter
is
too
far
forward
for
my
tastes

this
is
now
my
favorite
beer
it
was
my
3rd
try
at
american
hoppy
wheat
beers
gumballhead
80
acre
and
then
a
little
sumpin
great
cloudy
color
terrific
foamy
head
i
really
like
the
citrus
profiles
these
beers
have
i
like
that
it
has
a
higher
abv
the
tangerine
flavors
dont
cloud
or
fight
the
beer
taste
i
cant
wait
for
the
brewery
to
open
up
in
chicago
o
pours
great
smells
excellent
and
tastes
even
better
one
of
my
favorites
my
first
pass
with
this
beer
was
mediocre
but
the
second
was
much
better
the
yeast
used
with
this
brew
is
what
makes
it
special
it
has
a
unique
and
interesting
flavor
it
is
certainly
worth
trying
it
has
a
bit
of
a
wild
yeast
character
to
it
while
still
being
clean
and
refreshing
o
one
of
the
best
examples
if
not
the
best
of
a
wheat
ale
amazingly
smooth
easy
to
drink
never
gets
old
comments
fug
great
hands
down
the
number
1
ipa
of
all
time
cant
get
enough
of
that
beauty
lil
sumpin
pairs
so
well
with
a
vindaloo
curry
any
night
of
the
week
its
a
home
run
the
guy
at
providence
beverage
they
call
dennis
overall
this
beer
is
a
winner
this
and
gumballhead
are
definitely
my
favorite
wheat
beers
would
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
to
decide
the
victor
cheers
lagunitas
has
scored
a
major
hit
with
this
beer
the
nose
and
flavor
are
addictive
and
the
beer
just
keeps
getting
better
and
better
with
each
passing
sip
i
love
the
combination
of
tropical
fruit
flavors
they
combine
to
create
a
flavor
that
most
any
person
will
find
acceptable
at
the
very
least
including
those
who
are
not
normally
ipa
fans
its
a
very
tasty
beer
that
earns
a
big
thumbs
up
from
me
overall
this
beer
isnt
very
true
to
the
style
in
my
opinion
as
i
dont
get
much
wheat
flavor
which
is
probably
why
this
is
my
favorite
wheat
ale
lol
this
would
make
for
a
great
lighter
tasting
and
drinkable
ipa
i
find
myself
drinking
an
awful
lot
of
this
during
the
spring
and
summer
months
how
is
this
7
5
my
favorite
lagunitass
beer
along
with
hop
stoopid
highly
recommended
o
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
is
one
of
my
goto
session
brews
balanced
and
very
tasty
probably
the
best
american
wheat
ale
ive
had
wish
the
fruity
character
were
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
but
a
great
beer
overall
o
a
fine
wheat
that
reminds
more
of
a
west
coast
ipa
than
a
typical
wheat
beer
great
o
im
rather
new
to
the
world
of
hoppy
wheats
if
theyre
all
this
damn
good
it
looks
like
i
will
have
to
keep
indulging
great
brew
lagunitas
a
fantastic
ale
at
roughly
60
ibus
this
is
an
ale
to
recommend
to
any
of
your
friends
regardless
of
palate
and
preferences
strong
floralcitrus
aromas
with
a
smooth
two
finger
head
from
the
bottle
this
ale
is
the
perfect
supplement
to
a
spring
day
o
4

great
beer
i
dont
think
ive
had
this
fresh
enough
before
lagunitas
is
a
pretty
impressive
brewery
great
hoppy
big
beers
o
good
beer
wouldnt
be
my
first
pick
but
i
wouldnt
pass
up
an
opportunity
to
drink
it
again
the
name
and
label
really
gather
your
attention
ooverall
another
great
beer
by
lagunitas
would
be
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
glad
i
got
to
try
this
very
sought
after
brew
now
i
see
why
its
so
popular
a
great
back
porch
beer
overall
decent
balance
unique
for
its
style
i
wish
there
were
more
wheat
characteristics
to
the
beer
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
take
it
over
gumballhead
overall
nice
easy
drinking
brew
seems
to
go
down
way
to
easy
for
7
5
which
could
lead
to
trouble
one
of
the
better
ones
in
this
style
delicious
and
pleasant
tropical
ipa
or
even
a
hoppy
apa
hard
to
say
anything
bad
about
this
beer
balanced
with
a
decent
complexity
and
huge
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
the
whole
day
perfectly
executed
great
choice
of
hops
and
wheat
gave
it
some
roundness
this
is
a
complex
ale
no
other
way
to
put
it
but
it
is
still
easy
to
drink
warm
or
cold
with
or
without
food
the
way
i
would
describe
it
to
a
friend
would
be
imagine
your
favorite
belgian
white
all
that
bread
and
banana
goodness
now
throw
a
well
balanced
single
ipa
at
it
poof
thats
the
little
sumpin
sumpin
i
think
they
were
talking
about
i
love
this
beer
and
buy
it
when
i
see
it
good
beer
with
some
taste
and
appearance
lacking
i
was
a
little
reluctant
to
try
this
because
i
thought
it
couldnt
be
as
good
as
lagunitas
sucks
brown
shugga
substitute
boy
was
i
wrong
this
is
just
fantastic
if
this
is
going
to
be
available
yearround
it
will
be
in
my
refridgerator
yearround
this
is
a
great
ale
perfect
amount
of
hop
profile
on
the
aftertaste
and
a
sweet
fruity
taste
upfront
bitterness
lingers
for
a
bit
but
quickly
dissipates
leaving
you
wanting
another
sip
alcohol
is
hidden
well
this
just
became
one
of
my
favorite
hoppy
ales
a
must
try
next
up
for
me
is
the
sucks
brown
shugga
i
first
tasted
this
one
at
an
event
that
included
lagunitas
ballast
point
and
dogfishhead
and
i
found
myself
back
for
several
little
cups
of
this
newfound
gold
an
aromatically
distinct
smooth
ale
with
almost
brown
ale
qualities
in
a
hoppier
golden
form
this
one
has
has
quickly
become
a
staple
within
my
rotation
of
beers
that
can
be
bought
in
a
grocery
store
a
great
beer
pale
yellow
body
clear
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
tight
patchwork
pf
lacing
aroma
is
strong
wheat
with
a
kiss
of
orange
flavor
has
ripe
oranges
sweet
clementines
great
drinkability
and
flavorful
to
boot
o
the
entire
staff
over
at
lagunitas
needs
to
pat
themselves
on
the
back
for
this
one
not
only
have
they
devised
a
geniusly
complex
and
interesting
beer
theyve
also
devised
some
effin
delicious
flavors
hops
wheat
honey
light
malts
all
wrapped
up
in
a
devilishly
drinkable
package
this
onell
be
finding
its
way
back
into
my
fridge
in
the
future
this
is
an
ipa
with
wheat
for
all
intents
and
purposes
and
a
big
one
at
that
big
aroma
big
flavor
i
consider
it
an
excellent
and
somewhat
unique
beer
among
the
yearround
ipa
selection
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
plan
and
simple
it
is
a
standard
in
my
fridge
but
until
tonight
i
never
thought
to
write
a
review
taste
starts
with
a
bit
of
bread
then
an
explosion
of
pineapple
followed
by
a
bunch
of
mango
has
a
mango
pineapple
and
tangerine
finish
crisp
citrusy
and
light
bread
aftertaste
has
an
above
average
heaviness
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
above
average
carbonation
compliments
beer
nicely
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
lagunitas
and
i
will
always
seek
this
out
fresh
when
i
can
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
very
wellbalanced
and
flavorful
slightly
hazed
golden
brew
with
more
head
than
marilyn
chambers
ever
gave
the
aroma
and
taste
are
full
of
so
much
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
its
enough
to
make
carmen
mirandas
head
jealous
goes
down
smoother
than
a
babys
ass
highly
drinkable
and
a
few
of
these
makes
most
any
woman
highly
bangable
o
solid
flavor
profile
balance
is
good
though
i
would
like
just
a
bit
more

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
has
great
flavor
i
will
be
drinking
many
more
o
this
brews
best
attribute
is
the
look
and
it
is
sexy
but
i
think
this
one
goes
like
this
its
not
you
its
me
we
should
see
other
people
although
i
can
appreciate
the
the
time
put
into
this
ale
it
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
i
remember
this
one
differently
though
and
i
need
one
more
go
at
it
to
decide
a
unique
take
on
the
style
but
too
light
on
hop
character
definitely
worth
grabbing
but
far
from
a
favorite
o
lahgookneetuss
does
it
again
a
wonderful
offering
from
a
brewery
that
can
do
no
wrong
so
far
just
moved
to
california
and
cant
wait
to
head
down
to
petaluma
to
check
out
the
brewery
good
game
pat
to
the
boys
at
lagunitas
no
homo
o
tastes
like
a
undercarbonated
ipa
definitely
a
great
albeit
strong
apa
for
the
abv
but
im
definitely
in
favor
of
the
more
traditional
ipas
like
bells
two
hearted
in
terms
of
flavor
and
mouthfeel
this
beer
honestly
gave
me
a
halfchub
on
the
smell
making
me
expect
a
hoppycitrusy
ipa
but
then
it
fell
flat
when
it
came
to
taste
i
can
definitely
see
how
some
people
like
this
beer
but
it
just
aint
for
me
this
ale
pours
a
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
thick
lasting
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
for
a
wheat
ale
there
is
a
little
spice
and
some
floral
notes
present
as
well
the
flavor
follows
suit
very
fresh
citrusy
and
a
bit
spicy
the
wheat
flavor
is
subtle
and
the
whole
beer
comes
together
very
nicely
this
is
definitely
another
winner
from
lagunitas
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
overall
a
hoppy
take
on
a
rather
predictable
style
though
i
missed
the
malts
this
is
certainly
a
tasty
beer
i
want
more

really

to

cirtusfruits
are

and
a

one
of
my
personal
favorites
o
this
is
the
best
hoppy
wheat
beer
out
there
better
than
80acre
and
gumballhead
in
my
opinion
i
could
throw
back
3
or
4
of
these
pretty
quickly
ad
get
myself
in
trouble
with
the
7
5
what
a
brew
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
lots
of
flavor
going
on
and
its
all
exceptionally
balanced
and
given
the
relative
intensity
of
this
beers
its
remarkably
drinkable
o
definitely
worth
a
try
fruit
is
definitely
one
of
the
things
i
look
for
in
wheat
pale
ales
and
this
delivers
my
favorite
lagunitas
beer
o
an
extremely
wellconstructed
beer
very
drinkable
and
excellent
introduction
beer
to
craft
beer
curious
appearance
is
beautiful
nose
is
very
light
when
cold
so
nose
it
but
do
not
expect
much
until
it
warms
the
nose
does
not
grow
as
big
as
the
taste
as
it
warms
mouthfeel
is
awesome
this
beer
is
great
o
excellent
beer
i
love
this
i
will
buy
this
again
a
mediumfull
body
and
a
solid
effervescence
work
well
together
there
is
a
strong
grapefruit
aftertaste
a
dry
finish
and
a
reasonably
warming
aspect
a
good
beer
but
not
right
for
the
style
too
many
things
missing
i
wish
there
was
more
to
it
than
just
hops
hops
hops
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
snifter
1514
serve
it
from
a
snifter
glass
you
wont
regret
it
embodies
a
full
mouth
feel
i
havent
seen
in
a
lot
of
ipas
yet
out
of
a
bottle
it
will
be
a
little
less
rewarding
taste
wise
as
most
of
its
quality
seems
to
com
from
from
the
aroma
so
make
sure
to
stimulate
those
hops
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
in
an
ipa
full
mouth
feel
great
aftertaste
and
the
head
lasts
for
at
least
half
the
beer
the
blend
of
flavors
in
this
one
really
hits
the
spot
it
begins
with
a
splash
of
citrus
and
honey
with
a
soft
malty
center
finishing
up
with
a
tail
of
grassyness
and
orange
rind
its
got
a
slightly
sharp
medium
mouthfeel
that
pleasantly
lingers
overall
this
brew
defies
any
sort
of
set
style
not
a
bad
drink
for
any
time
of
the
day
would
overpower
a
meal
but
is
great
on
its
own
i
may
have
another
one
now
o
i
wish
i
would
have
waited
for
the
temperature
to
come
up
a
bit
before
drinking
but
after
it
did
this
beer
tastes
wonderful
i
dont
taste
the
wheat
at
all
even
though
i
caught
a
whiff
of
it
at
first
smell
definitely
a
very
citrus
fruity
beer
tastes
like
an
ipa
a
great
brew
by
lagunitas
o
this
may
be
my
favorite
lagunitas
beer
to
dateill
have
to
give
sucks
another
try
excellent
beer
at
an
amazing
value
overall
excellent
ale
with
superb
sessionability
oversatile
beer
it
can
be
labeled
ipa
if
need
be
there
is
enough
bitter
hop
and
pine
in
it
i
tend
to
keep
a
sixer
at
all
times
of
sumpin
sumpin
great
alone
or
with
food
super
refreshing
that
doesnt
compromise
on
flavor
i
love
its
level
of
7
5
abv
as
well
brownie
points
for
the
artsy
vintage
bottle
label
o
wow
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
i
usually
dont
sit
down
and
drink
3
beers
at
once
now
a
days
but
i
kept
coming
back
for
more
of
this
i
was
surprised
how
easy
these
go
down
given
the
abv
rating
overall
outstanding
beer
o
a
good
beer
by
lagunitas
the
hops
really
linger
on
my
tongue
which
is
interesting
considering
this
isnt
an
ipa
and
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
them
personally
not
a
big
hop
head
which
may
be
why
the
bitterness
bugs
me
for
just
being
a
pale
and
at
that
with
wheat
i
dont
find
it
to
be
particularly
unique
but
very
good
nonetheless
watch
out
as
a
6er
of
these
will
get
ye
o
juicy
beer
as
mentioned
above
really
great
and
just
the
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
to
level
things
out
delicious
comes
to
the
table
a
slightly
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aromas
of
citrus
grapefruit
and
lemon
with
bits
of
bread
and
spice
the
flavor
follows
quite
well
a
citrus
hoppy
ale
with
a
bit
of
bready
malt
and
spicy
wheat
medium
body
with
a
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
almost
bubbly
mouthfeel
pretty
damn
good
for
a
hoppy
wheat
beer
thanks
todd
for
suggesting
it
i
wouldnt
have
ordered
it
on
my
own
othis
is
pretty
damn
good
not
a
huge
wheat
fan
but
these
guys
did
it
right
highly
recommend
another
very
solid
beer
from
lagunitas
drank
more
like
an
ipa
or
apa
than
a
pale
wheat
not
very
much
wheat
characteristic
however
still
an
excellent
beer
that
packs
a
puch
in
abv
yet
i
could
still
throw
back
five
or
six
of
i
had
another
bottle
and
upgraded
my
review
a
couple
of
pts
today
to
bad
grocer
so
greedy
they
would
sell
many
more
overall
this
beer
is
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
it
being
i
could
see
this
one
being
very
versatile
has
a
session
type
appeal
to
it
but
could
work
well
in
other
settings
another
good
effort
by
lagunitas
overall
im
rarely
a
fan
of
super
hoppy
beers
but
this
complex
brew
is
definitely
a
keeper
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
full
head
that
laces
well
light
nose
of
piney
hops
with
citrus

the
background
against
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
light
body
and
well
carbonated

is
mostly
piney

against
some
grapefruit

well
balanced
but
not
very
flavorful
or
complex
overall
clean

a

of

appearance
has

has
a
nice
balance
of

bringing
out
a

balance
with
the
sweet

clean

is
medium
with
good
carbonation
one
of
the
better
and
easier
drinking
ipas
ive
had
in
awhile
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brews
from
lagunitas
available
year
round
it
is
a
regular
in
my
iipa
rotation
i
consider
it
a
top
10
in
the
iipas
i
have
tasted
it
is
difficult
to
find
american
wheat
ales
that
arent
pretty
insipid
to
my
palate
even
from
decent
breweries
american
wheat
is
such
a
broad
style
and
many
err
on
the
side
of
bland
and
bubbly
presumably
a
profitdriven
decision
on
the
other
hand
lagunitas
rarely
if
ever
disappoints
and
has
a
reputation
for
heavyhanded
hopping
so
i
snagged
a
sixpack
of
this
when
i
happened
upon
it
at
a
socalled
wine
market
that
also
has
a
decent
craft
selection
worth
every
penny
a
bottle
of
this
elixir
pours
a
pleasing
golden
yellow
with
a
lot
of
thick
white
head
the
brewer
wanted
that
classic
wheat
head
retention
and
executed
this
variable
like
a
pro
stuff
sat
there
like
meringue
aroma
was
also
pleasantly
evocative
of
lemon
meringue
pie
among
other
signs
of
a
solid
malthops
balance
i
get
mixed
citrus
a
grainy
spice
and
a
little
resin
or
pine
all
on
top
of
a
graham
cracker
malt
backbone
palate
is
fairly
chewy
creamy
and
smooth
but
pungently
bitter
lemon
lime
orange
and
grapefruit
passion
fruit
and
cantaloupe
starfruit
apricot
and
a
touch
of
something
that
recalls
white
wine
this
starts
like
a
fruit
bowl
but
ends
with
a
grainy
bitter
coda
of
piney
wood
green
bananas
and
some
floral
components
that
evoke
tobacco
or
sweetgrass
not
particularly
estery
or
phenolic
as
per
the
american
style
this
is
a
wheat
ale
hopped
like
an
ipa
and
is
the
perfect
antidote
to
north
american
wheat
beers
that
taste
like
foam
and
not
much
else
may
be
too
bitter
for
some
expecting
a
more
traditional
wheat
experience
pale
straw
appearance
thick

truly
unique
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
great
smells
excellent
and
tastes
even
better
flavor
lingers
in
your
mouth
begging
you
to
have
another
and
i
think
i
will
overall
try
it
just
try
it
o
this
was
pretty
good
i
get
the
feeling
or
at
least
hope
that
this
bottle
may
have
been
a
bit
on
the
older
side
ill
try
again
sometime
in
the
future
would
have
again
well
worth
finding
if
i
had
to
venture
a
guess
i
would
say
this
bottle
is
a
little
past
its
prime
and
im
sure
this
beer
is
much
juicier
when
more
fresh
as
is
this
beer
has
an
under
whelming
set
of
flavors
took
the
beer
straight
from
a
38degree
fridge
and
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
the
head
was
minimal
even
with
a
rather
careless
pour
down
the
side
of
the
glass
while
small
the
head
is
very
tight
and
it
coats
the
glass
all
the
way
down
at
cold
fridge
temperature
its
flavor
doesnt
have
a
chance
to
really
open
up
carbonation
dominates
your
tongue
let
it
warm
up
to
the
mid
to
high
40s
and
the
beer
comes
alive
its
smells
like
honey
wheat
bread
and
tastes
about
the
same
with
a
lingering
maltiness
and
a
sweetness
that
sticks
with
you
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
that
is
nice
to
sip
on
when
you
get
home
from
work
my
favorite
go
to
beer
never
disappoints
compliments
any
meal
love
it
with
sushi
if
i
cant
find
anything
new
i
can
always
rely
on
lil
to
satisfy
my
thirst
fresh
and
hoppy
it
can
be
enjoyed
all
year
round
even
nonbeer
drinkers
can
enjoy
this
beer
what
a
nice
surprise
to
find
in
the
old
publix
beer
case
whoever
the
beer
buyer
for
these
lames
are
finally
made
good
what
a
great
beer
most
things
from
cali
usually
are
a
bit
weird
for
my
taste
however
this
sweet
concoction
is
worthy
of
being
in
a
cooler
at
a
bama
bon
fire
anytime
nice
hoppiness
with
a
smooth
wit
beer
type
finish
that
is
all
update
bumped
the
rating
slightly
for
smell
taste
and
overll
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
beers
overy
good
beer
that
started
my
weekend
off
right
leaves
you
ready
for
the
next
sip
oa
delicious
summer
ale
solid
ipa
but
lacking
some
lusciousness
and
a
presence
somehow
would
happily
drink
again
though
poured
from
bottle
into
a
mason
jar
yeah
its
a
ball
dont
worry
pours
slightly
hazy
orange
with
a
nice
two
finger
white
head
smell
is
sweet
hops
wheat
pine
taste
is
full
of
perfectly
balanced
wheat
with
sweet
piney
hops
plenty
of
citrus
some
pineapple
some
other
sweet
fruity
notes
i
love
this
beer
definitely
a
perfect
west
coast
hybrid
of
an
ipa
and
a
wheat
beer
as
a
lover
of
both
styles
this
is
a
winner
for
me
o
well
it
took
me
a
couple
of
trips
to
ny
to
get
it
but
i
finally
did
and
it
was
worth
it
this
is
a
great
beer
nice
and
easy
to
drink
full
of
flavor
and
what
i
expected
from
this
brewer
lagunitas
was
the
brewer
that
started
changing
my
mind
on
the
west
coast
style
of
beer
and
this
has
completed
the
conversion
i
will
be
buying
more
on
my
next
trip
overall
great
beer
that
displays
strong
bitterness
with
pine
and
a
little
citrus
notes
but
also
exhibiting
toasty
and
biscuity
notes
strong
bitter
finish
and
great
nose
overall
o
one
of
my
favorite
pale
ales
to
date
almost
could
be
considered
an
ipa
probably
why
i
like
it
so
much
the
only
other
beer
ive
had
in
these
ranks
is
oskar
blues
pale
ale
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
sweet
bitter
heavy
yet
easy
drinking
a
perfectly
balanced
ale
it
has
the
lagunitas
hop
profile
and
malt
bill
just
amped
up
a
bit
prost
lampertland
o
wow
great
will
be
buying
again
the
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
is
the
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
taste
it
pours
smoothly
with
a
slight
head
and
the
colour
is
fantastic
when
taking
a
sniff
of
the
beer
you
can
clearly
smell
the
hops
but
it
isnt
overpowering
its
as
if
there
is
enough
to
say
im
here
but
im
not
going
to
melt
your
face
off
the
taste
is
very
similar
you
get
the
boldness
of
the
hops
but
the
aftertaste
is
smooth
and
lacks
the
bitterness
of
some
overly
hoppy
ales
lagunitas
is
a
favorite
so
i
am
slightly
biased
the
complexity
of
this
brew
renders
it
a
favorite
o
decent
ipa
i
would
order
again
overall
pretty
good
personally
i
would
rather
have
a
little
more
malt
in
the
backbone
of
this
one
the
hops
are
balanced
out
in
the
aroma
but
not
in
the
taste
i
do
like
the
lightness
in
body
for
the
abv
this
one
does
not
taste
as
strong
as
it
is
the
body
is
moderate
to
light
astringent
from
the
hops
is
a
bit
of
a
distraction
over
all
a
nice
hop
forward
beer
but
would
like
some
backing
or
balance
overall
this
is
a
unique
and
very
good
pale
wheat
ale
a
style
that
has
some
very
good
examples
yet
isnt
terribly
popular
this
beer
is
just
a
little
behind
gumballhead
in
overall
quality
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
lending
towards
the
overall
drinkability
and
outstandingness
of
this
beer
so
i
end
where
i
began
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
period
o
terrific
beer
and
so
drinkable
yep
o
had
to
drink
3
before
i
finished
my
evaluation
id
finish
it
review
my
notes
and
then
have
to
have
another
to
validate
the
4
75
on
taste
its
that
good
good
stuff
complex
and
well
balanced
pours
light
amber
almost
yellow
color
with
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
okay
has
a
citric
aroma
slightly
piney
lightly
citric
malty
taste
up
front
with
a
nice
bitter
piney
hop
at
the
end
with
a
wheat
edge
bitter
soapy
aftertaste
that
is
great
excellent
beer
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
owell
done
i
wasnt
expecting
so
many
hops
but
i
enjoyed
it
its
more
of
an
ipa
than
an
apa
but
whatever
its
delicious
m
7
5
abv
is
hidden
quite
nicely
as
i
put
away
a
few
too
many
of
these
without
realizing
it
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
and
also
a
very
good
one
as
for
alss
this
beer
is
lagunitas
in
a
nutshell
playful
name
unique
flavor
and
a
very
solid
beer
like
all
their
ipas
it
pours
out
very
light
in
color
with
a
light
lacy
head
the
body
is
nice
not
too
heavy
but
obviously
qualifies
as
a
light
dipa
i
just
wish
i
could
pickup
a
half
barrel
for
my
fridge
has
great
carbonation
and
tastes
wonderful
the
hops
are
there
but
not
over
bearing
o
amarillo
hops
added
to
a
wheat
ale
delicious
and
a
great
beer
for
anytime
of
the
year
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
offerings
o
uniquely
foamy
extremely
entertaining
for
an
aipa
yes
i
deviate
from
beeradvocates
classification
as
the
packaging
suggested
many
do
great
hop
complexity
yet
i
feel
that
most
other
brews
in
this
category
that
ive
sampled
can
provide
the
same
profundity
maybe
my
hops
palate
hasnt
been
properly
developed
quite
possible
maybe
ive
only
been
sampling
the
finest
of
aipas
possible
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
its
casings
hopefulness
of
tasting
everything
anew
still
a
great
beer
cheers
overall
a
wheat
beer
for
ipa
drinkers
o
the
wheat
really
shines
through
on
this
one
and
im
not
getting
the
hop
profile
i
would
expect
from
a
beer
going
neck
and
neck
with
gumball
head
i
think
i
prefer
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
because
i
get
less
wheat
taste
from
it
i
will
drink
it
again
because
there
are
5
left
from
the
6pack
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
fresh
from
the
brewery
to
get
a
better
idea
of
where
they
were
trying
to
take
the
hop
profile
champagne
like
carbonation
and
surprising
bright
orange
transparent
fruity
and
hoppy
on
the
nose
with
some
warm
spices
smooth
taste
light
but
hinting
towards
an
amber
but
like
a
not
so
bitter
ipa
pretty
damn
delicious
smooth
on
the
tongue
light
to
medium
body
i
would
certainly
drink
again
delicious
id
recommend
it
o
im
sold
i
had
been
avoiding
this
one
for
almost
two
years
simply
due
to
the
fact
that
its
labeled
a
wheat
beer
i
should
kick
myself
this
is
a
deliciously
hopped
beer
with
an
amazingly
light
body
considering
the
mad
availability
and
downright
reasonable
price
i
have
a
new
staple
ipa
o
goes
down
smooth
and
carries
enough
taste
to
keep
it
interesting
a
great
summertime
beverage
overall
quite
powerful
for
a
pale
ale
particularly
one
with
wheat
i
should
think
but
the
sweet
secondary
flavors
made
this
something
special
and
the
hops
were
zany
and
enjoyable
too
much
going
on
for
this
to
be
a
sessionable
beer
but
definitely
something
one
ought
to
try
cant
give
this
more
than
a
4
overall
simply
because
i
felt
it
was
more
of
an
ipa
than
an
apa
i
have
had
this
many
a
time
but
for
some
reason
never
gave
it
a
score
i
see
why
people
compare
it
to
sucks
all
lagunitas
beers
seem
to
have
that
amazing
citrus
quality
that
i
for
one
just
love
they
are
all
different
in
there
way
some
more
malty
some
more
bitter
some
more
piney
but
i
think
we
can
all
agree
you
know
a
lagunitas
beer
when
you
taste
it
o
pretty
tasty
fairly
drinkable
and
by
no
means
a
typical
wheat
beer
solid
but
nothing
to
wow
you
with
surprise
surprise
maybe
i
am
a
wheat
ale
guy
after
all
o
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
fine
example
of
why
laguanitas
is
one
of
the
best
craft
beer
producers
around
everything
about
this
beer
is
spot
on
for
the
type
of
beer
that
it
is
although
i
personally
didnt
like
the
bitterness
the
aftertaste
left
that
is
just
my
personal
opinion
would
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
like
this
style
of
beer
overall
quite
good
nice
beer
indeed
malty
sweetness
kicks
off
the
taste
experience
and
it
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
earthiness
along
with
some
pear
or
maybe
grapefruit
flavors
ends
moderately
dry
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
character
it
is
one
i
will
remember
o
i
wish
all
wheat
beers
tasted
like
this
this
is
far
closer
to
an
apa
or
even
an
ipa
my
ratings
are
biased
by
my
preference
if
i
rated
on
style
itd
be
lower
but
that
would
be
a
disservice
to
the
beer
this
beer
is
insanely
good
and
you
owe
it
to
yourself
if
youre
on
this
site
to
get
it
if
its
available
one
of
my
top
10
across
all
styles
a
golsen
straw
fluffy
head
with
nice
lacing
s
intense
citrus
grapefruit
hint
of
pine
t
hoppy
but
in
a
very
citrus
way
that
comes
off
as
refreshing
m
slightly
thicker
mouthfeel
than
expected
a
bit
creamy
likely
from
the
wheat
overall
without
a
doubt
my
favorite
ipa
it
just
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
n
overall
a
damn
tasty
beer
really
closer
to
an
ipa
and
for
that
reason
its
probable
the
best
apwa
ive
had
pretty
solid
all
around
and
worth
picking
up
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
deep
golden
to
orange
with
nice
foamy
head
smell
is
amazing
lots
of
bright
citrus
fruit
with
a
hint
a
pine
quite
hoppy
for
a
wheat
beer
but
very
tasty
sour
lemon
tartness
and
bready
with
a
full
body
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
is
present
but
its
balanced
by
the
bready
yeast
and
wheat
by
the
lemony
sourness
and
by
the
hops
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
very
enjoyable
o
never
had
a
lagunitas
beer
and
tried
this
on
a
recommendation
i
was
not
disappointed
it
was
also
my
first
pale
ale
wheat
beer
and
it
held
up
well
for
sure
would
have
again
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
considering
it
oits
a
good
beer
probably
best
when
fresh
the
more
you
drink
this
the
better
it
becomes
it
really
starts
to
build
a
good
citrus
flavor
overall
a
really
great
beer
but
id
prefer
a
bit
more
haze
to
make
it
easier
to
convince
myself
this
isnt
an
ipa
remarks
pretty
complex
and
different
excellent
beer
overall
a
nice
thin
layer
of
foam
that
sticks
around
some
decent
lacing
along
the
edge

lots
of

they
definitely
play
second

o
overall
what
a
fantastic
beer
hands
down
the
best
american
pale
wheat
ale
ive
ever
had
blows
gumballhead
out
of
the
water
if
you
ask
me
highly
recommend
o
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
super
balanced
very
tasty
and
yet
refreshing
especially
when
cold
despite
the
higher
alcohol
content
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
could
be
treated
as
a
session
beer
but
could
have
you
stumbling
home
afterwards
wonderful
stuff
o
this
one
is
so
refreshing
and
loaded
with
fruity
flavor
the
fruitiness
is
authentic
almost
like
it
has
fruit
juice
infused
well
balanced
with
nearly
a
perfect
mouthfeel
could
easily
get
through
a
6pack
of
this
o
lagunitas
rarely
disappoints
and
this
is
no
exception
glad
to
recommend
this
beer
delicious
o
this
reminds
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
a
wheat
delicious
none
the
less
this
is
a
beer
i
plan
on
coming
back
to
often
this
beer
delivers
quite
a
bit
more
than
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
its
got
a
lot
of
sumpin
sumpin
good
as
it
says
on
the
bottle
life
is
short
dont
sip
o
this
is
a
superbly
drinkable
beer
that
fits
any
season
a
year
round
go
to
beer
for
me
o
i
am
not
normally
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
but
every
now
and
then
i
find
one
that
i
really
enjoy
this
is
one
of
those
rare
ipas
that
i
find
drinkable
and
enjoyable
first
opening
this
beer
i
was
impressed
by
its
smell
and
moved
quickly
to
get
a
taste
in
the
beer
first
hit
as
a
great
bitter
to
a
kind
of
spicy
ting
at
the
end
it
provided
me
with
interest
at
first
taste
but
for
some
reason
after
the
first
taste
i
lacked
the
full
first
experience
and
was
dismayed
waited
a
little
bit
and
tried
it
again
and
it
provided
a
decent
taste
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
can
see
the
uniqueness
of
spicy
ting
that
some
may
appreciate
overall
a
very
nicely
done
slightly
unique
brew
i
need
to
add
more
wheat
to
my
homebrewed
ipas
overall
impression
worthy
of
the
hype
more
like
an
apa
or
even
a
light
ipa
but
whatever
they
call
it
its
a
keeper
beer
is
a
gauzy
golden
amber
with
a
light
head
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
tangerine
bread
taste
start
off
with
a
modest
malt
taste
and
ends
with
a
lingering
hop
hit
of
grapefruit
rind
very
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
very
good
it
is
nicely
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
well
balanced
citrusey
pale
ale
drinkable
and
delicious
overall
really
great
i
would
buy
this
one
again
in
all
honesty
im
more
inclines
to
buy
some
great
lakes
lake
erie
monster
but
all
the
same
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
taste
doesnt
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
smell
but
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
o
easily
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
even
though
i
would
classify
it
as
an
ipa
before
a
wheat
ale
the
sugar
balance
is
perfect
but
this
beer
can
definitely
change
once
age
is
put
on
it
so
drink
it
fresh
awesome
beer
i
had
my
first
lalssa
a
month
or
so
before
i
started
writing
reviews
on
ba
i
remember
it
being
excellent
this
one
did
not
change
my
opinion
im
on
a
tasteeverythingnewyoucanaffordtopourdownyourgulletandafewyoucant
summer
binge
but
when
that
is
done
im
expecting
this
one
will
be
on
my
list
of
repeat
buys
for
2014
and
beyond
that
is
if
im
still
allowed
to
drink
beer
when
national
health
fascism
kicks
in
described
as
a
pale
wheat
ale
id
rival
any
dipa
with
the
fruitiness
of
the
hops
here
tons
of
character
as
tangerines
grapefruit
peach
apricot
lemon
and
orange
burst
onto
a
backdrop
of
floral
pine
the
back
bone
wheat
is
lost
in
a
juicy
fruit
array
this
is
so
well
done
so
good
and
tasty
id
put
it
against
so
many
of
the
top
dogs
o
4
50
i
was
initially
of
the
impression
that
laguintas
was
one
of
the
most
overrated
west
coast
breweries
but
suffice
it
to
say
my
opinion
has
changed
dramatically
with
several
of
their
recent
offerings
including
this
one
this
is
a
really
refreshing
american
wheat
ale
with
lots
of
the
west
coast
ipa
characteristics
i
could
put
several
of
these
done
without
feeling
full
and
enjoy
every
taste
this
is
also
exceptionally
reasonably
priced
for
a
6
pack
for
this
caliber
o
i
love
this
beer
i
love
hoppy
wheats
in
general
and
this
one
is
toward
the
front
of
the
pack
pours
light
gold
and
clear
with
two
fingers
of
foam
that
wont
fall
down
lots
of
clinging
lace
the
nose
is
grapefruit
pine
and
a
little
resin
as
it
warms
it
smells
like
wheat
and
honey
the
malt
is
a
surprising
standout
in
the
glass
bready
and
lots
of
biscuit
the
hops
are
vigorous
earthy
and
herbal
their
spiciness
is
tamed
down
by
the
big
malt
character
what
a
surprise
this
beer
was
a
celebration
of
hops
without
being
overly
fruity
or
bitter
a
celebration
of
pale
malt
that
was
straightforward
and
not
overly
sweet
robust
yet
easy
to
drink
with
a
lightly
oily
mouthfeel
and
a
long
dry
finish
this
beer
really
does
have
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
overall
a
great
wheat
ale
smooth
yet
hoppy
lagunitas
struck
gold
with
this
one
one
of
the
better
american
wheat
beers
this
packs
a
punch
that
wheat
beers
normally
lack
will
be
buying
again
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
overall
this
is
a
great
hoppy
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
ales
but
the
hop
presence
in
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
it
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
wheat
ales
overall
this
beer
is
so
close
to
dog
fish
head
90
min
rating
it
is
crazy
i
would
probably
drink
this
one
more
due
to
the
fruity
scents
but
dfh
had
slight
better
carbonation
this
is
most
definitely
the
gumballhead
of
the
west
coast
and
i
love
how
affordable
and
easy
that
this
is
to
find
around
these
parts
flavorful
juicy
but
ultimately
very
refreshing
works
well
for
the
warm
weather
whats
there
not
to
like
i
think
with
this
one
and
ton
of
past
successes
ive
had
with
lagunitas
i
can
officially
call
them
one
of
my
new
favorites
well
done
keep
it
up
as
always
o
excellent
beer
taste
and
quality
closer
to
some
of
the
better
dipas
than
other
wheat
beers
in
this
class
the
taste
is
less
distinct
but
begins
with
a
slightly
bready
character
that
gives
way
to
a
bitter
citrus
hop
taste
moving
to
a
touch
of
caramel
and
finishing
with
a
grassy
hop
bite
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
very
fine
level
of
carbonation
enjoyable
all
around
o
definitely
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
everything
in
the
right
place
and
well
balanced
if
not
a
touch
more
hoppy
than
the
norm
overall
a
great
daily
drinker
despite
the
higher
abv
i
would
have
another
with
a
side
of
thai
food
or
jalepeno
poppers
o
such
a
sessionable
complex
reasonably
priced
year
round
brew
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
from
lagunitas
my
favorite
brewery
o
wheat
beers
typically
arent
my
thing
but
its
hard
to
dislike
anything
lagunitas
hops
up
easily
my
favorite
wheat
beer
as
of
now
sumpin
sumpin
is
surely
deserving
of
the
praise
it
gets
m
light
and
refreshing
in
spite
of
how
complex
and
full
the
flavor
is
a
bit
spicy
but
goes
down
smoothly
and
doesnt
linger
o
a
beer
i
will
certainly
purchase
again
its
nothing
that
im
going
to
buy
all
the
time
but
its
a
damn
good
beer
great
taste
appearance
and
aroma
o
this
is
pretty
good
its
very
interesting
almost
like
an
ipa
with
a
tad
bit
of
wheat
added
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
try
o
i
love
this
beer
well
balanced
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
the
pricing
is
spot
on
another
win
for
lagunitas
o
this
was
really
solid
for
a
style
that
can
be
underwhelming
so
often
quite
enjoyable
a
fun
somewhat
fruity
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
certainly
some
caramel
specialty
mixing
with
several
other
grains
on
a
two
solid
row
base
to
create
a
flavorful
ale
that
is
sneaky
good
this
ale
is
great
for
those
new
to
craft
beers
but
will
not
satisfy
the
strong
robust
pallets
o
very
good
beer
great
nose
nice
and
easy
to
drink
right
amount
of
bitterness
definitely
worth
trying
o
one
of
their
best
yearround
beers
for
sure
this
beer
can
best
be
described
as
sort
of
a
wheat
ipa
it
pours
a
beautiful
golden
orange
with
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
nice
with
flowery
hops
notes
citrus
and
grapefruit
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
but
after
all
its
a
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
like
a
light
wheat
ipa
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
it
is
much
more
interesting
than
other
wheat
beers
and
will
please
hop
heads
well
hopped
but
not
too
bitter
o
great
beer
good
smell
taste
bitterness
if
you
havent
tried
this
yet
definitely
pick
it
up
next
time
you
see
it
definitely
worth
the
buy
o
overall
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
which
was
great
i
really
really
liked
this
beer
and
it
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
lagunitas
beers
that
i
have
tried
i
suppose
this
is
one
way
to
brew
the
best
of
a
style
hop
the
hell
out
of
a
beer
with
some
wheat
malt
and
try
to
pass
it
off
as
a
pale
wheat
ale
however
you
brand
this
one
its
great
and
id
buy
it
again
in
a
flash
o
i
really
liked
this
one
and
it
will
make
a
regular
appearance
in
my
beer
lineup
particularly
now
that
the
hot
weather
has
finally
arrived
o
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
beers
i
always
just
assumed
as
have
many
others
that
it
was
an
ipa
because
thats
what
it
drinks
like
but
lo
and
behold
its
a
wheat
beer
and
a
damn
delicious
one
at
that
average
head
which
maintained
plenty
of
lacing
pours
a
beautiful
deep
golden
color
the
smell
was
understated
an
interesting
combination
of
fruityhoppy
flavor
the
citrus
fruitiness
cuts
the
hoppy
bitterness
for
a
delicate
balance
that
was
quite
drinkable
the
7
5
abv
was
surprising
i
was
looking
for
a
springsummer
ale
to
replace
my
beloved
quads
and
this
just
might
fit
the
bill
definitely
gets
points
for
originality
it
definitely
is
a
little
sumpin
cause
i
have
no
idea
what
just
happened
o
very
good
beer
that
would
be
great
if
the
alcohol
was
dialed
back
slightly
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
if
not
too
far
out
there
like
a
wheat
ipa
lagunitas
doing
what
lagunitas
does
best
this
is
an
interesting
combination
of
styles
and
one
that
i
would
be
happy
to
have
a
few
times
over
the
course
of
a
day
overall
this
is
my
favorite
from
lagunitas
so
far
absolute
gem
purchased
at
the
fresh
market
in
naples
fl
for
9
99
a
sixer
no
bottled
on
date
o
great
wellrounded
original
beer
a
must
try
best
i
have
had
from
lagunitas
tastes
like
100
degree
day
in
petaluma
bravo
went
from
a
sample
to
hadda
have
a
six
pack
could
easily
be
an
every
day
beer
but
at
7
5
a
little
too
strong
for
me
and
my
every
day
beer
has
to
be
in
cans
it
is
dales
pale
ale
overall
an
almost
perfect
beer
for
a
hophead
looking
for
something
a
little
but
not
too
different
to
have
on
the
beach
or
by
the
pool
o
the
perfect
beer
for
90
degree
summer
heat
cant
beat
the
refreshing
flavor
combined
an
alcoholic
punch
that
does
its
job
without
knocking
you
on
your
rear
end
overall
this
a
pleasant
find
and
lagunitas
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
with
this
and
other
offerings
i
would
have
thought
this
was
an
ipa
if
b
a
had
not
told
me
the
true
style
the
wheat
adds
a
sweetness
and
smoothness
that
is
not
normally
present
in
an
ipai
keep
thinking
of
this
as
an
ipa
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
really
great
brew
but
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
wheat
ale
12oz
bottle
pours
a
pale
goldenstraw
color
with
slight
haze
nice
rocky
white
head
holds
good
retention
leaves
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
juicy
fruity
aroma
juicy
fruit
gum
tropical
mango
floral
hop
its
tangy
and
a
bit
tart
tropical
fruit
mango
mandarin
juicy
fruit
gum
mild
bitterness
on
the
clean
finish
medium
body
nice
carbonation
allows
flavors
to
meld
on
the
palate
overall
i
always
enjoy
this
hopped
up
version
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
really
nice
flavors
here
perfect
for
summertime
but
with
the
higher
abv
its
less
sessionable
than
most
apwas
a
hazy
dark
golden
in
color
aromas
of
various
citrus
fruits
and
some
pine
cone
taste
begins
with
some
apricot
then
a
bready
middle
and
a
piney
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
extra
rich
and
creamy
overall
a
quite
strong
but
quite
good
wheat
beer
i
assumed
it
was
an
ipa
before
i
went
to
ba
this
is
an
easily
affordable
nicely
hopped
pale
wheat
ale
i
liked
this
version
of
little
sumpin
best
would
i
drink
it
again
i
would
its
not
hard
to
find
i
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
beer
this
much
lagunitas
makes
a
bunch
of
differnt
beers
that
taste
very
similar
to
one
and
other
but
i
freaking
love
that
taste
i
could
totally
drink
way
more
of
these
then
i
should
4
5
o
good
wellrounded
beer
great
price
too
this
beer
will
make
its
way
into
my
rotation
of
6
pk
purchases
overall
pretty
good
but
i
think
ill
take
oberon
or
all
day
ipa
over
it
for
a
summer
beer
overall
a
very
hoppy
pale
wheat
ale
just
what
you
want
from
your
west
coast
hop
gurus
the
wheat
malt
adds
a
nice
complexity
and
certainly
makes
it
drinkable
but
i
kind
of
wish
they
went
with
all
barley
malt
the
tartness
gets
in
the
way
of
the
hop
character
a
tad
still
a
very
minor
gripe
for
a
beer
i
buy
with
great
frequency
especially
during
the
hot
summer
days
mouthfeel
is
fairly
sharp
and
slightly
sticky
on
the
back
end
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
that
is
very
refreshing
and
very
full
of
flavor
so
yummy
very
refreshing
and
crisp
with
tons
of
hop
smell
and
taste
but
still
as
drinkable
as
a
regular
pale
ale
i
think
the
half
wheat
malt
gives
it
a
great
refreshing
mouthfeel
as
well
just
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
i
love
sns
pale
ale
as
a
go
to
for
a
drinkable
beer
with
food
or
something
on
a
hot
day
but
when
i
want
that
with
more
hop
and
richer
flavors
i
go
for
the
little
sumpin
sumpins
pours
a
beautiful
brass
color
with
a
3
finger
head
that
is
very
slow
to
recede
but
leaves
a
nice
bit
of
lace
when
it
does
nose
is
full
of
hopscitrus
and
pine
maybe
a
touch
of
bread
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
good
body
and
nearlyundetectable
alcohol
taste
is
boldly
bitter
with
more
grapefruit
than
pine
in
the
taste
compared
to
the
nose
clean
on
the
palate
not
too
astringent
extremely
easy
to
drink
a
topdrawer
wheat
ipa
one
of
the
best
ive
had
too
bad
its
a
limited
release
overall
a
very
nice
ipa
that
i
would
definitely
do
again
a
very
hoppy
and
malty
wheat
beer
another
great
lagunitas
beer
excellent
brew
there
isnt
too
much
depth
and
complexity
to
this
beer
its
a
solid
choice
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
summer
ale
with
plenty
of
dry
hops
and
bitterness
but
mild
enough
for
the
nonipa
enthusiasts
to
enjoy
the
wheat
really
shines
through
and
begs
for
a
zesty
food
pairing
tacos
guacamole
ceviche
or
pretty
much
anything
fresh
cilantro
thats
how
i
enjoyed
it
the
flavor
doesnt
linger
long
and
the
abv
isnt
killer
very
nice
golden
honey
color
with
a
decent
head
and
beautiful
lacing
smell
isnt
as
pronounced
as
id
expect
slight
notes
of
honey
pine
and
grapefruit
nice
malty
flavor
with
subtle
citric
fruits
and
light
damp
woodiness
with
a
surprisingly
tropical
fruit
note
light
mouth
feel
nicely
carbonated
overall
a
great
pale
wheat
ale
perfect
for
the
first
warm
day
of
the
year
o
shocked
by
this
not
a
traditional
wheat
beer
by
any
means
drinks
more
like
a
great
apa
or
ipa
lots
of
delicious
fruity
hop
flavor
thats
refreshing
and
smooth
lagunitas
still
tops
my
favorite
breweries
o
overall
it
was
pretty
solid
tastes
like
your
typical
ipa
i
think
its
placed
under
the
wrong
style
honestly
o
the
best
representation
of
a
style
that
i
generally
dont
like
every
other
wheat
pale
ive
tried
seemed
confused
and
unbalanced
lagunitas
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
as
far
as
mix
of
hops
to
pair
with
the
wheat
great
summer
day
beer
one
to
keep
on
hand
for
friends
this
is
a
great
beer
but
da
taste
is
just
honestly
discusting
taste
like
over
sweeted
beer
eith
2
much
sugar
or
watever
over
bullshit
they
put
on
it
this
is
a
great
beer
im
surprised
i
never
sought
it
out
before
i
will
now
this
is
a
new
favorite
poured
this
american
pale
wheat
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
clear
pale
color
produced
a
thick
white
head
left
an
outstanding
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
mega
amounts
of
floral
hops
medium
bodied
this
wheat
ale
had
a
foundation
of
soft
malted
wheat
that
gives
way
to
a
citric
hops
by
far
the
best
american
pale
wheat
ale
i
have
sampled
nothing
ordinary
about
this
beer
really
good
beer
went
well
with
my
kobe
burger
i
suggest
drinking
it
with
a
frosted
mugand
be
careful
drinking
it
it
sneaks
up
on
you
i
love
it
i
love
it
ilove
it
nice
bottle
bartender
suggested
italso
women
like
it
its
a
good
little
conversatin
piece
o
what
a
great
tasting
smelling
and
overall
drinking
experience
the
flavors
hide
the
high
abv
very
nicely
very
sessionable
three
bottles
later
i
was
feeling
as
good
as
it
gets
this
is
a
great
brew
but
is
more
of
an
ipa
than
a
wheat
ale
remarkable
first
impressions
from
this
brewery
i
sure
do
love
living
in
southern
california
and
seeing
sixers
of
this
within
walking
distance
of
my
house
does
it
get
any
better
not
by
much
im
thinking
not
by
much
i
would
rate
this
a
wc
offering
d
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
many
beers
in
the
style
that
are
comparable
i
can
think
of
one
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
well
priced
a
bit
simple
but
incredibly
refreshing
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
since
people
say
its
a
lot
like
gumballhead
and
some
say
its
better
it
smells
amazing
but
as
far
as
taste
goes
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
is
overbearing
and
there
doesnt
seem
much
else
to
the
flavor
there
is
no
subtle
complexity
that
gumballhead
has
this
beer
tastes
like
an
ipa
and
im
not
an
ipa
fan
wish
it
had
less
bitterness
and
more
of
a
complex
wheat
flavor
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beer
this
has
been
my
favorite
so
far
i
could
really
get
behind
a
6
pack
of
this
while
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
will
test
this
theory
in
a
couple
months
fantastic
this
is
the
type
of
daily
drinker
i
love
i
would
love
a
keg
of
this
on
at
home
for
the
style
this
is
an
amazing
beer
overall
a
personal
favorite
and
new
to
me
this
week
you
ever
notice
how
everything
has
to
be
todays
version
of
yesterdays
whatever
well
whatever
sometimes
we
wonder
what
the
world
would
be
like
if
everything
was
perceived
for
what
it
is
and
not
what
it
reminds
you
of
the
sun
would
rise
everyday
as
if
for
the
first
time
youd
work
as
if
newly
born
youd
see
your
lover
next
to
you
anew
the
air
would
smell
like
flowers
work
would
be
like
the
first
day
back
in
school
a
beer
would
make
your
eyes
roll
back
in
your
head
in
ecstasy
well
maybe
not
but
you
get
the
idea
cheers
o
i
think
im
going
to
have
a
new
go
to
beer
this
season
when
the
weather
gets
hot
we
happy
i
cant
say
enough
about
this
beer
this
is
my
go
to
brew
when
poured
it
has
a
beautiful
golden
appearance
it
smells
very
hoppy
with
a
fruitiness
tone
i
get
the
cascade
hops
instantly
every
bottle
i
have
tried
has
the
same
crisp
full
fresh
taste
like
i
said
if
i
am
having
trouble
deciding
i
always
grab
a
6
of
this
o
a
clean
pale
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
that
balances
nicely
overall
i
couldnt
be
anymore
impressed
a
really
interesting
beer
very
fruity
in
a
varied
way
like
beer
fruit
punch
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
had
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
quite
delicious
not
the
standard
hopped
brew
which
is
loaded
with
citrus
hop
this
one
has
a
very
nice
hopped
profile
blending
nicely
a
sweeter
body
with
a
variety
of
hop
flavors
it
is
almost
like
something
between
an
aipa
and
an
imperial
ipa
this
beer
pours
up
an
amazing
clear
gold
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
very
earthy
and
citrus
forward
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
delicious
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
full
excellent
beer
overall
o
great
beer
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
only
one
of
these
it
combines
the
smooth
taste
and
drinkability
of
a
hefeweisen
with
the
citrusy
hops
of
an
ipa
yummy
this
is
the
5th
beer
ive
tried
from
lagunitas
some
were
pretty
good
and
some
were
really
good
this
little
sumpin
ale
is
also
a
good
one
the
color
is
really
nice
very
clear
and
golden
colored
there
is
a
ton
of
lacing
the
smell
is
really
hoppy
it
tastes
like
a
good
solid
ale
not
as
much
citrus
as
an
ipa
which
is
why
i
usually
go
for
one
of
those
but
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
none
the
less
ill
keep
going
after
beers
from
lagunitas
i
havnt
been
let
down
yet
o
easy
to
drink
easily
a
highend
daily
drinker
for
a
beer
snob
wheat
malt
makes
this
a
lighter
version
version
of
their
flagship
offering
but
lagunitas
never
disappoints
me
its
been
a
few
years
since
i
last
had
this
beers
it
was
one
of
the
first
craft
brews
i
ever
had
so
i
was
relatively
unaware
of
what
i
was
trying
and
i
feel
so
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
fine
it
is
this
is
a
great
beer
o
love
me
some
lagunitas
and
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
theyve
basically
brewed
an
ipa
just
with
a
wheat
malt
im
excited
to
try
this
one
in
the
summer
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
lagunitas
is
making
some
killer
stuff
and
theyve
yet
to
disappoint
i
feel
very
lucky
to
be
able
to
have
access
to
many
different
types
of
beer
they
make
from
their
cappuccino
stout
to
brown
shugga
they
all
come
highly
recommended
cheers
overall
this
beer
seems
to
be
more
pale
ale
than
wheat
but
still
a
good
brew
though
nice
and
hoppy
for
a
apwa
too
overall
a
fantastic
beer
it
honestly
reminds
me
a
lot
of
another
outstanding
american
pale
wheat
ale
offering
by
boulevard
80acre
hoppy
wheat
if
i
lived
on
the
west
coast
outside
of
boulevards
footprint
this
beer
would
be
a
regular
goto
one
of
the
best
apwas
on
the
market
today
i
purchase
a
6
pack
whenever
the
opportunities
presents
itself
but
a
rare
treat
in
raleigh
nc
o
mark
of
good
beer
is
if
it
makes
you
want
another
thats
what
i
kept
thinking
as
savored
this
brew
deliciousness
o
wonderful
beer
its
incredible
easy
to
drink
the
citrus
flavors
really
shine
and
its
ridiculously
refreshing
i
think
i
have
found
my
new
summer
goto
apaipaeasy
drinking
brew
o
ok
i
really
dont
get
the
positive
reviews
here
this
was
a
boring
beer
with
nothing
to
offer
but
a
high
ibu
count
not
quite
a
drain
pour
but
not
up
to
the
standards
id
have
expected
from
lagunitas
o
overall
i
did
like
the
beer
i
think
this
beer
wheat
or
not
is
a
contender
for
many
pale
ales
out
there
i
would
highly
recommend
it
to
any
hop
lovers
it
was
enjoyable
to
drink
12oz
bottled
served
in
an
sa
perfect
pint
glass
pours
a
translucent
gold
with
a
fizzy
one
inch
bright
white
head
that
settles
into
a
creamy
skim
delicate
clusters
of
lacing
coat
the
sides
of
the
glass
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
wheat
and
orange
rind
taste
consistent
with
nose
no
real
surprises
however
there
is
a
pleasant
easy
tartness
to
the
flavor
profile
with
a
light
earthy
hops
bittering
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
a
slight
astringency
and
a
carbonation
that
falls
just
shy
of
lively
i
cant
believe
im
just
discovering
this
beer
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
looking
froward
to
adding
this
into
my
summer
rotation
o
a
very
enjoyable
well
crafted
beer
definitely
a
beer
i
will
return
to
time
and
time
again
great
beer
this
is
what
aipas
should
be
all
about
not
sure
if
the
wheat
malt
made
this
beer
cleaner
but
whatever
it
works
12
oz
bottle
poured
clear
pale
golden
with
a
decent
head
tasted
like
this
one
may
have
been
born
quite
a
while
back
as
the
aroma
of
hops
was
nearly
nonexistent
the
malty
middle
overwhelmed
i
will
not
buy
this
bottle
again
however
i
would
try
a
draft
just
to
see
how
a
fresh
one
compares
mmmm
this
is
friggin
delicious
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
goblet
and
let
me
first
say
love
the
pinupgirl
label
all
beers
should
have
pinupgirl
labels
gave
it
a
good
pour
and
didnt
get
much
of
a
head
there
but
what
was
there
was
densely
formed
by
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
for
a
wheat
not
real
cloudy
i
even
gave
it
a
swirl
at
the
end
which
i
think
did
absolutely
nothing
but
really
nice
light
amber
color
the
nose
is
great
pine
candy
berry
definitely
some
sour
yeastiness
love
it
flavor
is
great
sweet
but
nice
backing
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
pretty
perfect
light
with
a
punch
overall
this
is
a
kickass
beer
totally
worthy
of
the
overtenbucks
pricetag
and
i
will
definitely
get
this
again
absolutely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
honestly
can
go
good
with
anything
but
you
are
better
off
enjoying
this
beer
by
itself
it
has
so
much
too
offer
such
great
combination
between
the
yeast
and
malts
making
this
an
outstanding
brew
you
can
put
this
on
my
list
of
top
beers
overall
this
is
by
far
the
finest
wheat
beer
i
have
had
as
a
hophead
it
satisfies
my
need
for
bitterness
than
most
other
wheat
beers
lack
i
truly
hope
that
more
brewers
head
in
the
direction
of
aggressively
hopped
wheat
ales
o
this
is
a
good
beer
that
being
said
it
was
hoppier
and
less
wheatlike
than
i
was
expecting
from
the
style
wheat
beer
done
ipa
assertive
crisp
clean
and
hoppy
overall
another
interesting
lagunitas
brew
deceptively
smooth
but
packs
enough
of
a
punch
to
stand
alone
quite
well
i
think
you
have
to
really
like
this
style
to
go
back
to
it
too
many
other
good
offerings
from
this
brewery
and
at
least
for
me
too
many
better
styles
that
being
said
this
is
the
worst
brew
ive
had
from
lagunitas
and
given
the
rating
it
should
speak
volumes
about
their
beers
bottom
line
fantastic
offering
from
the
boyz
and
girls
at
lagunitas
i
would
call
this
an
ipa
like
flower
power
instead
of
a
wheaty
pale
ale
it
doesnt
have
the
pop
that
some
west
coast
ipas
have
because
of
the
wheat
and
malt
i
like
the
balance
of
this
beer
i
would
recommend
it
for
people
trying
to
get
into
ipas
because
of
the
good
smooth
bitterness
offering
of
the
beer
o
one
of
lagunitas
best
if
you
like
pale
ales
or
ipas
give
this
one
a
try
i
see
many
more
6packs
of
this
in
my
future
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
with
a
large
foamy
head
smells
of
piney
and
earthy
hops
and
lots
of
malt
taste
is
initially
very
hoppy
with
earthy
tones
but
finishes
really
syrupy
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
after
the
smell
it
doesnt
fully
ruin
it
but
it
does
bring
it
down
a
little
beer
is
carbonated
correctly
and
for
its
light
body
even
with
the
syrupy
taste
still
goes
down
smooth
overall
an
above
average
beer
in
general
i
like
the
hop
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
too
much
or
there
is
not
the
right
malt
sweetness
to
back
it
up
the
quality
is
there
its
just
not
quite
my
taste
not
sure
if
i
will
get
this
again
o
cant
believe
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
sweet
and
sticky
with
just
a
decent
amount
of
hops
this
is
so
drinkable
i
think
ill
be
having
more
of
this
very
soon
in
the
future
lagunitas
strikes
again
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
character
at
first
you
think
its
another
calistyle
hoppy
beer
but
it
is
full
of
sweet
flavors
as
well
i
really
dug
the
range
of
flavors
i
experienced
from
my
first
whiff
to
my
last
sip
highly
recommended
cheers
i
like
a
broad
range
of
beers
but
most
of
the
time
i
want
something
with
plenty
of
flavor
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
the
rich
roasty
creamy
stouts
and
ive
never
turned
down
a
rich
red
or
brown
ale
a
sailing
buddy
introduced
me
to
big
hops
beers
last
year
and
i
havent
looked
back
the
brewery
that
consistently
nails
the
big
hops
taste
test
is
lagunitas
the
lagunitas
beer
that
satisfies
me
every
time
i
pop
one
is
little
sumpin
sumpin
i
will
keep
drinking
and
enjoying
other
beers
but
i
will
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
for
a
looong
time
overall
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
for
any
time
of
year
well
done
lagunitas
and
i
hope
you
continue
to
crank
out
some
more
tasty
beers
such
as
this
one
this
is
a
medium
to
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
overall
quite
drinkable
with
that
7
5
abv
really
integrated
well
this
was
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
that
i
would
not
mind
having
again
and
drinking
pretty
effortlessly
during
the
summer
lagunitas
delivers
on
the
hops
once
again
definitely
one
to
include
in
my
rotation
overall
where
has
this
been
all
my
life
nice
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
regardless
of
the
style
light
and
bright
refreshing
tasty
goodness
super
easy
drinking
sessionable
hoppy
beer
here
once
i
got
on
ba
to
review
i
was
shocked
to
see
that
its
classified
on
here
as
a
wheat
ale
ive
never
tasted
a
wheat
ale
like
this
but
like
the
packaging
says
labels
are
often
confusing
and
arbitrary
ill
definitely
be
making
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
a
regular
in
my
fridge
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
its
very
possible
that
i
may
revisit
this
brew
in
the
future
lagunitas
uses
hops
extremely
well
from
what
the
offerings
ive
had
good
shit
o
never
had
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
no
wonder
its
so
highly
regarded
a
very
nice
drink
great
drinkability
great
flavor
profile
great
wheat
beer
with
a
giant
citrus
taste
o
extremely
drinkable
beer
the
mouthfeel
and
nice
peach
and
orange
flavors
make
it
a
great
beer
even
after
sitting
around
for
2
months
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
the
time
would
love
to
try
this
even
fresher
to
see
how
much
more
the
hops
come
out
would
recommend
to
any
hophead
probably
too
much
for
those
who
are
more
into
wheat
beers
this
will
be
a
staple
on
the
lawnmower
this
year
although
at
7
5
too
many
and
im
falling
off
awesome
warm
weather
brew
and
one
im
glad
i
can
get
anytime
one
of
the
lagunitas
better
beers
really
enjoyed
it
crisp
and
bitter
and
remains
really
pleasant
and
interesting
lots
of
nice
hop
intensity
clean
finish
i
will
look
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
next
time
i
go
shopping
final
thoughts
does
lagunitas
make
a
beer
that
isnt
an
ipa
whatever
the
answer
i
cant
wait
to
try
another
offering
from
them
would
i
drink
it
again
yep
o
a
very
good
pale
wheat
though
definitely
on
the
hoppier
side
beautiful
nose
and
well
integrated
flavors
make
this
a
worthwhile
visit
this
is
a
solid
ipa
with
a
heavy
wheat
bill
one
of
the
better
ipastyle
beers
from
lagunitas
if
i
had
never
tried
sucks
this
would
easily
be
there
best
fresh
its
downright
silly
ages
pretty
quickly
but
remains
drinkable
for
some
time
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
but
if
i
reviewed
it
as
a
wheat
ale
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
not
brewed
properly
to
style
as
an
ipa
it
is
great
though
overall
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
balanced
flavor
whats
not
to
like
o
the
appearance
was
a
total
disappointment
however
it
completely
improved
with
regards
to
taste
and
smell
overall
a
terrific
beer
that
missed
in
one
little
area
i
do
have
some
reservations
due
to
the
fact
this
is
supposedly
an
american
wheat
ale
o
this
is
the
most
perfect
beer
ive
ever
tasted
its
so
balanced
and
drinkable
youd
never
guess
it
was
7
5abv
and
65ibu
its
wonderfully
aromatic
floral
and
damned
tasty
i
hope
the
upcoming
homebrew
clone
can
you
brew
it
recipe
im
brewing
comes
within
75
of
this
beer
because
its
amazing
pours
clear
golden
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
quickly
clears
to
bubbles
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
nose
is
pine
hops
a
little
grass
light
caramel
sugars
grapefruit
and
other
tropical
notes
great
flavors
to
this
ipa
some
wheat
bitter
grapefruit
orange
light
mango
hops
pine
light
sugars
touch
of
lemon
caramel
malt
in
the
background
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbontation
leading
to
a
bitter
sweet
finish
a
solid
ipa
overall
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
quite
a
surprise
for
me
i
remember
trying
hop
stoopid
and
being
blown
away
by
it
as
well
and
this
further
solidifies
the
hype
surrounding
lagunitas
beers
for
me
i
will
definitely
recommend
it
to
winos
and
hop
lovers
as
i
find
this
to
be
a
great
wellrounded
brew
a
little
late
in
the
season
but
this
still
tastes
remarkably
fresh
i
could
go
for
some
spicy
vegetarian
indian
with
this
o
a
very
good
wheat
ale
with
loads
of
hops
flavor
that
nevertheless
doesnt
overlap
the
essential
crisp
refreshing
wheat
character
of
this
beer
the
relatively
high
abv
for
the
style
is
also
very
wellhidden
o
as
a
hophead
this
is
right
up
my
alley
i
havent
has
many
wheat
beers
but
this
is
about
ideal
for
me
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
be
buying
more
very
unique
beer
tasty
no
doubt
possibly
a
little
too
sweet
at
first
but
it
mellows
out
nicely
and
turn
into
one
hell
of
a
drinker
wheaty
and
fruity
all
around
with
a
nice
alcohol
warming
through
and
through
not
sure
if
im
in
love
with
some
of
the
hop
flavors
though
o
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
to
begin
with
o
im
not
a
hop
head
but
can
appreciate
this
hopforward
wheat
beer
its
put
together
well
and
makes
for
a
tasty
brew
recommended
overall
a
great
beer
to
drink
i
typically
get
this
as
a
treat
every
so
often
since
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
typically
a
few
dollars
more
than
sierra
nevada
a
real
good
beer
and
i
really
like
a
little
sumpin
wild
as
well
if
you
can
find
it
overall
lagunitas
does
it
again
with
a
style
that
i
am
really
liking
american
wheats
overall
a
really
good
beer
and
probably
my
favorite
so
far
from
lagunitas
awesome
example
of
the
style
and
dangerously
drinkable
with
the
7
5
completely
hidden
one
to
pick
up
whenever
possible
o
paired
with
an
awesome
burger
from
hole
in
the
wall
on
the
westside
of
la
which
i
would
say
leaves
umami
and
even
fathers
office
in
the
dust
great
hops
on
a
wheat
base
making
a
great
bright
brew
which
is
both
familiar
and
original
going
beyond
the
typical
west
coast
ipa
recipe
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
slicker
than
most
american
pale
wheat
ales
which
tend
to
be
pretty
effervescent
this
is
due
to
all
of
the
hop
oils
no
doubt
still
refreshing
though
overall
this
is
about
as
good
a
beer
as
the
pale
wheat
style
can
be
b
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
goto
beer
that
we
get
here
in
nj
ive
had
lots
and
lots
of
beers
and
some
seasonals
and
ipas
that
i
love
hell
even
more
than
this
but
this
sumpin
ale
really
gives
you
a
bang
for
your
buck
plus
you
can
sit
back
and
have
more
than
one
granted
its
not
a
session
ale
but
it
does
drink
like
one
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
me
and
miss
sumpin
will
be
spending
some
serious
time
together
this
summer
i
tried
this
beer
on
a
cool
fall
day
and
liked
it
ok
but
its
unseasonably
warm
today
and
after
a
long
bike
ride
this
is
it
lagunitas
is
a
really
good
brewery
the
cpj
nice
overall
this
is
the
best
pale
wheat
ale
that
i
have
had
including
gumball
head
and
the
best
part
about
this
one
is
it
is
available
right
down
the
road
any
time
i
want
more
o
a
very
spoton
beer
ill
certainly
be
coming
back
for
somewhat
regularly
definitely
has
great
flavours
for
the
value
of
the
beer
as
i
said
this
beer
does
not
easily
fall
into
a
specific
category
but
its
certainly
a
great
brew
high
carbonation
makes
it
a
lil
heavy
heavy
on
the
belly
but
its
a
great
sipper
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
summer
or
fall
o
first
time
having
this
beer
and
i
must
say
i
realy
enjoyed
it
nice
and
refreshing
not
overly
hopped
worth
buying
on
a
regular
basis
the
wheat
malt
in
this
cleanly
hopped
highabv
pale
ale
creates
a
depth
and
complexity
of
flavor
that
ill
crave
delicious
mouthfeel
crisp
and
refreshing
mediumlight
body
slightly
above
average
carbonation
finish
is
dry
with
a
lingering
bitterness
a
unique
and
fantastic
offering
from
lagunitas
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorties
one
of
the
best
drinking
beers
when
its
fresh
i
had
it
first
on
tap
and
loved
even
non
craft
beer
drinkers
liked
it
it
is
what
gumball
head
wants
to
be
when
it
grows
up
it
is
like
a
wheat
ipa
with
great
aroma
it
is
best
when
fresh
so
if
you
buy
it
drink
it
it
loses
its
fruity
aroma
and
flavor
as
it
ages
try
to
buy
fresh
shipments
and
you
will
have
a
new
favorite
beer
if
you
enjoy
a
hoppy
american
pale
wheat
ale
sumpin
sumpin
is
the
ale
for
you
a
pretty
unique
and
good
tasting
beer
ill
have
to
remember
to
place
this
in
my
summer
rotation
o
more
complexity
than
your
typical
pale
wheat
beer
the
abundance
of
hops
certainly
contributes
to
this
some
of
the
hop
characteristics
remind
me
of
flower
power
although
i
wouldnt
say
that
these
are
similar
beers
a
terrific
fullflavored
warm
weather
beer
overall
drinkability
a
suprising
ale
the
alcohol
really
hits
you
on
this
one
great
flavors
and
smells
overall
a
highly
drinkable
balanced
ale
unique
and
delicious
i
could
pound
a
6
pack
without
even
thinking
twice
pours
a
yellow
slightly
orange
lightly
hazy
brew
with
nice
dense
head
smells
citrus
and
pine
and
hoppy
great
with
some
grain
and
malt
notes
almost
a
sweetness
there
taste
is
malt
and
grain
first
but
gives
to
bitterness
and
floral
and
tropical
fruits
and
manufactured
newness
yep
you
read
that
right
in
a
good
freshly
made
way
mouthfeel
is
light
for
this
with
a
creaminess
and
moderate
hop
echo
but
i
wish
it
to
be
more
and
a
winter
warming
that
is
nice
without
being
wacked
with
alcohol
a
really
terrific
beer
that
i
hope
to
have
again
d
excellent
beer
i
get
this
all
the
time
and
i
just
logged
onto
beer
advocate
to
check
out
what
i
originally
wrote
about
it
and
realized
id
never
reviewed
it
i
get
this
beer
all
the
time
though
its
a
great
session
beer
for
heavy
drinking
just
out
of
college
beer
lovers
i
highly
recommend
it
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
as
i
have
many
others
that
laguanitas
has
made
this
beer
is
an
excellent
drinker
light
crisp
and
refreshing
while
still
giving
bold
hop
flavor
that
we
all
love
a
potent
abv
fantastic
appearance
and
superb
smell
add
to
make
this
a
very
well
rounded
beer
one
to
add
to
my
always
in
stock
in
my
fridge
a
really
good
ipa
with
some
wheat
malt
base
interesting
and
delicious
o
a
fantastic
wellcrafted
ale
which
gives
pliny
a
run
for
its
money
glad
they
didnt
overdo
the
wheat
portion
tastes
more
like
a
quality
ipa
to
me
highly
recommended
overall
it
reminds
me
a
good
bit
of
lagunitas
ipa
but
it
just
has
more
oomph
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
if
you
will
certainly
not
for
those
new
to
craft
this
beers
heavy
on
the
hops
with
just
a
dash
of
malt
a
fantastic
beer
on
all
counts
overall
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
thirstquenching
wheat
beer
with
some
great
hop
flavors
going
on
throughout
the
flavor
profile
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
come
summer
time
overall
although
i
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
wheat
this
beer
is
pretty
amazing
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
way
to
go
lagunitas
overall
this
beer
is
absolute
quality
it
has
flavor
appetizing
smell
strength
7
5
abv
and
a
dry
enough
aftertaste
to
make
you
want
to
drink
more
and
more
and
more
y
mas
para
mi
hermanos
latinos
but
it
now
seriously
why
are
you
still
here
go
out
and
buy
it
another
winner
for
lagunitas
with
a
powerful
hop
punch
to
the
palate
yet
still
clean
and
refreshing
o
one
of
my
favorites
and
certainly
my
favorite
wheat
beer
in
that
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
overall
this
is
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
o
im
very
impressed
by
this
beer
great
citrus
hop
presence
with
a
sweet
malt
and
wheat
body
i
will
definitely
revisit
in
the
future
wow
this
is
one
amazing
brew
now
i
wish
i
could
grab
one
whenever
i
like
a
ton
of
aromatic
hops
and
plenty
of
malt
the
sweetness
borders
on
sugary
but
is
kept
in
check
by
hop
bitterness
cant
say
i
taste
much
wheat
as
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
wheat
ale
its
more
like
an
american
ipa
in
character
might
also
benefit
from
bottle
conditioning
but
im
nitpicking
this
is
a
superb
beer
and
goes
into
my
top
10
add
it
to
your
musttry
list
and
grab
one
if
you
see
it
o
this
is
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
much
better
than
i
was
even
expecting
dangerously
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
this
is
one
that
will
make
its
way
into
my
regular
lineup
and
will
probably
always
be
in
my
fridge
come
the
summer
o
wow
i
actually
did
not
think
this
beer
was
going
to
be
this
good
right
now
im
wishing
i
would
have
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
o
a
great
beer
a
good
stepping
stone
for
those
not
ready
to
jump
into
the
big
boys
of
the
ipa
fold
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
medium
golden
amber
one
finger
fine
offwhite
head
with
a
hint
of
wheat
flavor
follows
excellent
retention
and
lacing
great
aroma
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
lemon
caramel
malt
pine
and
citrus
hops
with
grapefruit
and
lemon
light
sweet
malt
supports
the
other
flavors
wheat
flavors
subdued
by
the
hops
and
citrus
very
nice
medium
creamy
body
with
an
superb
mouth
feel
very
tasty
and
well
made
not
really
to
style
for
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
not
cloudy
not
pale
wheat
element
rather
subdued
however
judged
as
another
fine
lagunitas
product
an
interesting
and
tasty
take
on
a
wheat
ale
smell
was
ripe
citrus
fruit
grapefruit
and
oranges
and
pine
hints
of
wheat
and
pale
malt
taste
is
very
similar
to
nose
loads
of
ripe
citrus
orange
grapefruit
pineapple
along
with
wheat
cracker
and
even
a
little
bite
of
pine
resin
medium
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
strong
carbonation
very
juicy
delicious
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
overall
this
is
by
far
the
best
lagunitas
brew
ive
had
to
date
i
wish
this
werent
a
seasonal
because
its
excellent
definitely
pick
yourself
up
a
sixpack
of
this
brew
while
it
lasts
i
certainly
will
be
grabbing
another
highly
recommended
this
is
an
often
overlooked
jem
style
is
very
unique
and
stands
outs
as
being
on
the
top
i
was
so
tempted
to
refer
to
this
beer
as
an
outstanding
version
of
a
session
ale
but
at
7
5
abv
this
is
anything
but
that
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
is
another
outstanding
example
of
the
no
frills
kindofbeers
that
the
folks
at
lagunitas
are
so
good
at
creating
o
great
for
an
ipa
id
happily
grab
a
six
pack
if
you
wanted
a
wheat
beer
i
think
youd
be
more
disappointed
the
label
uses
the
word
hops
eight
times
though
so
i
dont
see
that
happening
too
often
o
a
pleasant
soft
fruity
floral
sweetish
sipper
theres
one
note
in
the
nose
i
dont
like
but
thats
the
only
thing
i
dont
like
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
even
though
its
technically
classified
as
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
it
has
a
ton
of
fresh
flavor
and
depth
of
body
and
the
subtle
nuances
in
smelltaste
are
what
really
make
it
great
there
are
tons
of
pineygrapefruit
honey
hops
bready
yeast
and
a
bit
of
fruit
flavor
like
apple
and
pear
there
is
also
a
little
sweetness
to
the
hops
that
balances
out
the
whole
beer
i
could
have
this
beer
again
and
again
overall
a
really
good
juicy
ale
has
all
the
citrus
flavor
you
expect
from
a
west
coast
ipa
but
with
more
wheat
and
less
bitterness
this
pours
a
toasted
straw
color
unlike
your
typical
wheat
beer
this
has
a
gobsmack
of
hops
theres
a
light
aroma
with
some
floral
notes
and
lagunitas
trademark
hop
aroma
flavor
is
smooth
light
with
a
bit
of
a
funkand
some
generous
hopping
hiding
behind
this
its
strong
but
hides
it
well
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
glad
they
have
it
in
6
packs
it
is
now
time
to
put
hop
stoopid
in
6
packs
that
one
is
even
better
o
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
ale
and
not
just
your
run
of
the
mill
pale
ale
definitely
would
drink
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
grapefruit
and
lemons
with
some
wheat
malt
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
mainly
grapefruit
with
a
mild
hop
bitterness
that
is
nicely
offset
by
the
wheat
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium

edit
this
beer
is
now
available
in
nky
im
done
for
o
i
will
crave
this
beer
until
i
have
another
havent
been
able
to
get
my
hands
on
it
but
i
will
yes
i
will
o
a
wheat
ale
that
has
enough
hoppy
bite
to
keep
the
ipa
lovers
attention
id
have
this
one
with
some
bbq
which
i
did
when
i
tried
it
smoky
mesquite
and
this
are
made
for
each
other
interesting
beer
i
picked
it
up
simply
because
i
liked
the
label
i
had
no
idea
what
sort
of
beer
it
was
but
the
label
was
attractive
after
opening
and
pouring
it
into
a
glass
it
was
apparent
that
it
was
a
wheat
beer
which
generally
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
but
the
color
wasnt
off
putting
and
the
aroma
was
pleasant
nice
citrus
and
wheat
notes
i
thought
it
had
a
slightly
floral
smell
which
was
at
first
i
wasnt
too
sure
of
but
it
grew
on
me
i
took
my
time
drinking
it
and
found
overall
it
to
be
very
satisfying
and
clean
nothing
unpleasant
about
the
beers
head
or
the
consistency
in
the
glass
a
great
beer
for
being
outside
in
the
warm
weather
i
wouldnt
say
i
loved
it
but
could
surely
see
myself
drinking
it
again
i
think
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
the
more
you
drink
of
it
the
more
you
can
enjoy
it
cheers
o
in
my
opinion
of
the
great
examples
of
the
style
would
easily
drink
this
again
especially
on
draft
o
nice
balance
beer
can
see
a
lot
of
even
noncraft
drinkers
liking
this
or
i
guess
a
very
approachable
beer
a
standout
among
the
american
wheat
beers
really
strong
hop
presence
a
little
pine
and
a
little
resin
on
the
nose
very
crisp
feel
bubbly
definitely
a
little
bitter
but
goes
down
pretty
easy
its
a
little
strong
to
be
a
perfect
summer
sipper
but
it
is
an
excellent
overall
a
great
brew
will
buy
again
fo
sho
honestly
what
is
all
the
fuss
about
poured
from
bottle
into
perfect
pint
glass
big
fluffy
creamy
white
3
finger
head
its
very
frothy
eventually
settles
with
legit
cling
very
nice
golden
honey
light
yellow
color
smell
consists
of
light
pine
hops
wheat
sweet
resinous
hop
taste
is
similar
grassy
wheat
some
pine
cream
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
thick
with
light
bitterness
from
hops
smooth
very
good
overall
this
has
been
one
my
favorites
since
i
first
tried
it
its
crisp
and
refreshing
on
this
summer
evening
pours
a
honey
golden
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
a
nice
sweet
malt
underbody
providing
some
nice
doughiness
to
the
aroma
sitting
alongside
some
grassy
hops
and
some
grapefruit
flavor
offers
some
moderately
bitter
grassy
and
citric
hops
alongside
some
sweet
wheat
malt
a
crisp
medium
bodied
overall
not
a
bad
beer
the
beer
pours
a
clean
golden
color
like
very
light
yellow
piss
though
there
is
a
little
of
the
wheat
haze
towards
the
middle
and
lots
of
bubbles
tumbling
up
from
the
bottom
the
head
is
finger
thin
with
big
white
bubbles
and
a
nice
easy
retention
at
a
half
a
finger
that
leaves
sticky
thin
clouds
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beers
smells
surprisingly
nice
and
wet
with
pine
hops
and
some
nice
citrusy
tingles
but
i
dont
notice
any
of
the
wheat
in
the
smell
and
the
malt
and
yeast
seem
to
be
light
in
the
smell
the
beer
tastes
much
like
it
smells
thick
with
resinlike
pine
hops
the
malts
are
faint
in
the
initial
sip
as
the
hops
take
the
full
blam
but
the
after
taste
is
a
lovely
light
sweet
wheat
malt
with
side
tingling
from
the
hops
there
are
also
some
nice
light
citrus
tangs
in
this
beer
reminiscent
of
oranges
and
mango
the
mouthfeel
is
initially
really
rough
with
carbonation
and
the
hops
bitter
bite
leaving
the
tongue
feeling
assaulted
the
beer
is
really
clean
and
refreshing
on
the
tongue
but
the
after
feel
is
only
lightly
tingly
with
hop
and
a
slight
bitterburn
on
the
tongue
while
the
rest
of
the
mouth
has
a
thin
sheen
of
saliva
that
initial
mouthfeel
is
too
rough
for
my
taste
but
mellows
out
to
a
more
manageable
state
overall
the
beer
a
nice
hopbomb
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
reminiscent
more
of
sierra
nevadas
pale
ale
or
an
ipa
than
of
anything
thing
else
i
have
tried
this
is
admittedly
my
first
heavily
hopped
wheat
ale
and
i
love
the
hops
in
it
and
the
aftertaste
of
wheat
malt
is
very
intriguing
but
the
rest
of
it
isnt
very
different
from
other
ales
o
i
am
ok
with
a
wheat
but
usually
just
because
i
am
out
and
thats
about
the
best
choice
on
the
menu
also
i
love
that
this
is
a
wheat
at
abv
7
50
i
think
that
is
what
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
overall
lagunitas
has
redefined
the
american
wheat
ale
and
it
is
awesome
it
drinks
like
an
american
ipa
waves
of
hop
aroma
and
flavor
with
malt
sweetness
to
balance
my
favorite
american
wheat
hands
down
pretty
big
complex
beer
big
full
mouthfeel
but
goes
down
smooth
good
carbonation
sweet
tropical
fruits
with
a
hint
of
taffy
and
caramel
wheaty
goodness
on
the
middle
of
the
palate
with
a
sharp
bitter
edge
the
hops
are
really
bright
and
fruity
and
provide
a
nice
balance
to
the
subtle
malt
body
great
balance
and
all
the
flavors
play
really
well
together
great
how
the
hops
add
to
the
sweetness
and
the
balance
very
nice
great
damn
beer
we
need
to
see
more
of
it
nj
overall
yeah
its
a
good
one
had
a
bbq
last
weekend
served
this
one
up
to
some
craft
drinkers
got
some
positive
feedback
if
i
had
to
classify
this
beer
id
call
it
a
summertime
ipa
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
and
id
recommend
overall
very
good
and
no
complaints
on
my
end
salud
o
once
again
not
a
style
i
would
seek
out
alot
but
for
what
it
is
lagunitas
has
managed
to
make
something
drinkable
the
high
abv
is
enjoyable
though
for
many
it
might
make
this
unattractive
as
an
option
just
cant
bring
myself
to
want
any
beers
of
this
nature
not
bad
i
suppose
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
nice
head
on
it
nice
citrus
floral
aroma
is
a
preview
of
the
tastiness
that
awaits
in
your
glass
this
has
the
hoppiness
of
an
ipa
but
the
wheat
balances
the
flavor
nicely
and
it
has
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
i
cant
believe
this
beer
is
7
5
abv
so
smooth
o
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
and
im
glad
i
finally
gave
it
a
chance
i
would
have
no
idea
its
a
7
5
on
the
abv
scale
its
very
well
hidden
by
the
sensational
flavor
and
drinkability
golden
pour
thin
frothy
head
it
has
a
beautiful
floral
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
very
good
and
heavy
hop
profile
with
some
exciting
funkiness
that
makes
this
brew
stick
out
a
little
medium
heavy
mouthfeel
with
a
great
aftertaste
that
lingers
with
more
of
the
floral
notes
you
get
in
the
scent
cheers
plenty
of
hops
with
a
bit
a
malty
sweetness
wheat
adds
great
mouthfeel
quite
good
id
score
this
a
5
but
i
believe
in
always
leaving
room
for
improvement
amazing
hop
quality
amazing
nose
amazing
flavor
how
they
make
a
7
abv
beer
and
keep
it
so
nice
for
a
summer
day
is
beyond
me
i
had
several
ipas
after
this
including
some
truly
fantastic
beers
and
they
imparted
far
more
bitterness
wo
any
of
the
hop
flavor
this
spoiled
my
palate
because
it
was
so
good
please
enjoy
o
very
tastey
brew
overall
well
made
another
quality
brew
from
lagunitas
they
never
dissapoint
more
like
a
maltywheaty
pale
ale
for
a
summer
seasonal
it
stands
out
this
is
no
lawnmower
beer
o
a
good
beer
overall
good
amount
of
everything
and
well
balanced
throughout
lagunitas
never
dissappoints
o
nice
offering
from
lagunitas
i
think
i
prefer
this
over
their
maximus
a
winner
d
great
drinker
that
goes
down
easy
a
beer
with
a
unique
character
that
lets
it
stand
tall
in
a
sea
of
ipas
overall
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
given
how
bland
and
boring
most
exampled
of
the
style
typically
are
but
i
should
have
known
better
coming
from
lagunitas
this
offering
is
a
much
better
take
on
the
pale
wheat
ale
than
most
other
offerings
of
this
style
even
thought
i
would
consider
this
more
a
wheat
ipa
given
the
abv
instead
of
a
wheat
pale
ale
the
hoppiness
really
makes
this
a
great
refreshing
brew
and
one
i
will
gladly
revisit
in
a
bottle
or
on
draft
during
the
warmer
months
of
the
year
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
but
i
have
one
question
american
pale
wheat
ale
this
is
the
same
category
that
boulevard
unfiltered
wheat
and
sam
adams
coastal
wheat
and
summer
ale
is
in
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
those
beers
but
lagunitas
destroyed
all
of
them
with
this
until
i
read
the
classification
of
the
brew
on
ba
this
morning
i
thought
this
was
may
be
a
light
ipa
or
an
aggressively
hopped
apa
i
would
have
never
guessed
apwa
regardless
of
all
that
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
for
a
good
price
that
i
can
get
most
anytime
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
and
i
will
be
drinking
it
again
well
done
by
lagunitas
im
going
to
call
this
a
hybrid
of
styles
overall
nice
hybrid
style
here
very
refreshing
originally
reviewed
06272011
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
one
i
would
call
it
a
pale
ale
but
i
get
some
wheat
out
of
it
too
good
for
a
hot
day
and
will
probably
be
really
good
with
rich
foods
this
one
is
goes
perfect
after
a
sunny
early
summer
day
delicious
continuing
with
my
new
review
format
i
enjoyed
this
delicacy
during
game
seven
as
my
beloved
celtics
went
to
their
demise
go
thunder
poured
into
a
stone
nonic
pint
glass
as
it
says
on
the
bottom
of
the
six
pack
carrier
this
beer
defies
categorization
and
i
happily
agree
as
a
steady
ipa
and
dipa
consumer
i
found
this
to
be
a
more
than
refreshing
change
of
pace
it
will
definitely
be
a
regular
in
my
summer
rotation
heartily
endorsed
by
the
white
creek
kru
overall
a
nice
different
ipa
to
drink
on
hot
day
no
heavy
flavors
jump
out
or
overpower
overall
a
recomendable
beer
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
ive
ever
had
dont
know
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
buy
some
of
this
mfo
thick
and
creamy
feel
to
it
passive
carbonation
just
a
solid
beer
a
goto
i
like
this
beer
dont
know
how
many
i
could
drink
in
a
row
or
if
id
have
it
often
but
its
a
good
idea
to
throw
a
bottle
of
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
into
your
rotation
o
a
very
smooth
well
balanced
beer
sure
i
like
the
lagunitas
yeast
strand
so
i
may
be
partial
but
still
great
nice
and
hoppy
but
not
bitter
has
a
sweetness
to
it
any
any
rate
i
docked
it
12point
for
the
fact
its
more
of
an
ipa
than
any
sort
of
pale
wheat
ale
still
a
great
brew
just
not
at
all
what
it
claims
to
be
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
perhaps
my
favorite
from
lagunitas
definitely
a
must
try
if
youre
into
hoppy
beers
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
ive
tried
almost
every
release
from
lagunitas
that
has
come
out
in
the
last
7
years
and
this
ranks
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
i
hope
they
never
discontinue
this
one
because
i
will
keep
buying
it
and
promoting
it
as
long
as
its
around
thank
you
lagunitas
for
such
a
great
brew
overall
an
interesting
and
original
beer
very
tasty
and
hides
the
abv
very
well
have
and
will
continue
to
buy
regularly
o
as
others
have
said
this
is
more
ipa
or
apa
like
than
a
wheat
ale
though
still
well
made
and
tasty
overall
this
one
surprised
me
it
has
a
lot
more
citrus
and
wheat
than
the
nose
lets
on
and
its
incredibly
good
i
was
reluctant
about
trying
it
before
because
it
costs
9
89
at
my
work
but
this
beer
is
fantastic
definately
a
lagunitas
brew
because
they
did
it
proper
with
the
hops
but
also
really
flavorful
and
balanced
i
feel
like
this
beer
would
be
just
as
at
home
next
to
the
pool
on
a
hot
day
as
it
would
be
with
a
nice
meal
or
even
sitting
at
your
computer
and
just
enjoying
a
beer
versatile
complex
and
most
importantly
delicious
drinkability
such
a
great
beer
for
its
price
if
i
want
a
good
beer
for
a
good
price
i
generally
go
to
lagunitas
or
sometimes
abita
the
flavor
matches
the
aroma
noteworthy
alcohol
feel
and
flavor
good
hop
bite
almost
from
the
beginning
the
body
is
rich
and
gives
an
element
of
rounded
malt
tastes
i
dont
really
note
any
wheat
in
this
one
its
a
very
good
pale
ale
overall
its
a
little
above
average
but
a
good
warm
weather
beer
which
hides
the
alcohol
o
you
could
tell
this
was
a
lagunitas
brew
after
the
first
sip
huge
tropical
fruit
aromas
and
flavor
has
that
signature
west
coast
tropical
thing
going
on
very
nicely
balanced
ale
and
most
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
good
beer
overall
not
overly
complex
and
definitely
not
a
pale
wheat
ale
but
a
good
ipa
with
lots
of
nice
hop
characters
without
being
overly
bitter
very
bizarre
brew
here
pours
a
clear
red
tinted
copper
color
with
a
one
inch
off
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
smells
like
fresh
hops
grassy
and
earthen
english
malt
backing
some
wheat
malts
as
well
but
does
not
smell
like
a
wheat
beer
and
its
usually
accompanying
yeast
flavor
is
strangely
hopped
up
front
not
quite
fruity
a
bit
dry
and
mildly
spiced
tough
to
place
exactly
but
possibly
tasting
some
fresh
cascade
hops
here
feel
is
good
fuller
bodied
than
most
kind
of
a
hybrid
beer
in
taste
and
feel
not
a
wheat
beer
per
se
but
not
an
ipa
either
well
carbonated
it
carries
the
unique
flavors
of
the
hops
overall
a
cool
beer
good
bargain
and
interesting
blend
of
ingredients
ill
most
likely
have
this
again
not
bad
for
a
wheat
hops
beer

etoh
very
drinkable
almost
like
a
desert
beer
has
a
sweet
aftertaste
i
first
had
it
had
rhodeside
grill
in
arlington
va
the
2nd
time
i
had
it
was
as
jaleo
a
josé
andrés
restaurant
in
wash
dc
just
last
week
bought
a
6
pack
at
whole
foods
on
p
street
for
9
99
this
is
one
of
my
top
6
beers
for
sure
simply
put
this
beer
is
dank
from
the
complex
smell
and
taste
to
the
heavy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
awesome
ive
tried
multiple
lagunitas
brews
and
id
put
this
up
there
with
the
lagunitas
sucks
and
the
ipa
very
delicious
and
totally
worth
the
price
i
paid
for
a
sixer
great
ale
i
never
thought
id
say
it
but
i
think
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
may
have
dethroned
gumballhead
for
my
favorite
in
this
style
and
that
says
a
lot
coming
from
a
guy
who
would
defend
fff
to
the
death
o
my
father
just
brought
this
back
from
california
and
im
so
glad
he
did
this
is
a
first
class
beer
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
feel
it
is
slightly
comparable
to
lagunitas
sucks
just
a
little
lighter
in
the
body
cant
wait
to
drink
one
of
these
while
mowing
my
lawn
this
summer
o
nice
brew
mellow
enough
to
have
several
in
a
row
but
may
make
you
think
everything
else
you
own
smells
like
crap
o
this
is
a
flavorful
delicious
representation
of
a
style
that
i
usually
find
underwhelming
and
boring
the
flavors
are
of
all
sorts
of
fruit
and
just
enough
hops
to
satisfy
and
balance
i
could
definitely
drink
several
of
these
on
a
hot
day
i
love
this
stuff
and
im
happy
to
see
it
back
for
the
season
o
such
a
great
beer
if
the
abv
was
a
touch
lower
id
feel
perfectly
comfortable
in
drinking
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
dangerously
deceptive
pardon
me
i
gotta
end
this
review
so
i
can
go
get
a
little
more
sumpin
sumpin
o
this
is
a
rereview
since
my
original
exposure
to
this
brew
almost
one
year
ago
not
only
was
i
lucky
enough
to
acquire
a
few
6rs
of
their
lagunitas
sucks
holiday
ale
it
is
now
very
clear
that
little
sumpin
sumpin
was
the
basis
for
that
limited
release
recipe
albeit
the
holiday
ale
produced
a
more
substantial
head
with
great
lacing
if
you
missed
out
on
lagunitas
sucks
holiday
ale
just
go
get
yourself
a
fresh
sumpin
sumpin
and
you
will
not
be
missing
anything
superb
overall
superb
beer
here
great
wheat
beer
a
summer
staple
for
sure
ajr
we
always
keep
this
beer
stocked
in
the
beer
fridge
lagunitas
makes
some
excellent
beer
and
while
many
of
there
beers
are
said
to
be
similar
the
little
sumpin
rises
above
in
my
opinion
hops
malt
and
a
little
citrus
sweetness
make
this
beer
perfect
for
those
that
like
hops
but
are
not
considered
a
hophead
d
i
had
been
disappointed
by
all
the
other
lagunitas
offerings
i
had
tried
but
this
one
is
very
well
done
i
have
order
this
beer
twice
at
a
local
drinking
establishment
i
originally
picked
this
beer
based
upon
the
name
and
the
brewery
and
i
was
pleasantly
awarded
for
my
prejudice
i
had
never
had
a
beer
like
this
before
it
is
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
along
with
having
the
complex
flavor
profile
of
the
ipa
style
that
i
have
grown
to
adore
i
cannot
get
too
far
into
the
astm
profile
but
i
can
say
it
ranked
pretty
well
in
all
of
them
in
the
summer
if
i
were
not
in
the
mood
for
intense
maltiness
i
would
be
sure
to
go
with
this
beer
o
really
interesting
tasty
beer
pours
a
goldenamber
color
with
a
nice
white
colored
head
fruity
sweet
smell
at
first
apples
grapefruit
good
sweet
malty
aroma
and
finishes
up
with
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
apple
and
citrus
followed
by
a
mild
hoppy
bitterness
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
o
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
that
hits
almost
every
note
spot
on
while
speaking
amongst
some
friends
we
have
concluded
this
is
one
of
the
best
deals
available
and
if
i
had
to
have
a
nice
brew
to
sip
on
a
a
sunny
afternoon
there
is
none
better
than
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
not
to
mention
at
10
49
a
sixer
with
wide
availability
this
is
simply
the
benchmark
the
beer
is
golden
hued
and
pretty
clear
the
white
head
is
about
a
quarter
inch
thick
leaving
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
nice
gaining
strength
as
the
beer
is
allowed
to
warm
hops
citrus
particularly
grapefruit
are
the
primary
scents
the
flavor
takes
things
up
a
notch
wow
what
a
delicious
beer
hop
forward
with
ample
contributions
from
citrus
fruit
easy
to
drink
like
juice
minimal
malt
body
and
alcohol
presence
nice
feel
i
will
be
returning
to
this
beer
often
recommended
overall
very
drinkable
please
sir
may
i
have
another
yum
overall
lagunitas
has
been
on
fire
these
last
few
years
and
this
beer
is
proof
by
far
the
best
pale
wheat
ale
ive
had
to
date
definitely
a
beer
ill
be
purchasing
in
the
future
pours
a
bright
yellow
gold
with
nice
transparency
short
bubbly
white
head
with
weak
retention
fresh
zesty
hops
with
bleached
yeast
white
bread
creamy
malts
grapefruits
and
pineapple
on
the
aroma
floral
and
mildly
earthy
beautiful
fresh
hop
flavor
with
smooth
lemon
zest
grapefruit
and
wheaty
malts
sour
bite
with
a
smooth
bready
hoppy
mouthfeel
clean
fresh
aftertaste
a
little
outside
of
my
normal
style
range
but
this
one
is
done
well
and
always
enjoyable
o
this
is
almost
a
tale
of
two
beers
at
first
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
later
its
tiring
hopmalt
sweetness
renders
it
merely
good
still
a
nice
wheat
ipa
thats
a
great
value
even
when
its
less
than
fresh
o
great
brew
good
balance
in
the
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
is
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
wheat
beer
and
an
ipa
what
ever
it
is
it
is
good
grab
a
six
pack
not
a
single
you
will
wish
for
the
six
if
you
dont
o
this
is
one
for
the
collection
grab
a
six
pack
the
first
opportunity
you
get
drinkability
is
sky
high
at
7
5
im
sucking
this
down
no
problem
its
just
so
tasty
i
will
be
buying
a
sixpack
of
this
the
next
chance
i
get
after
having
this
and
sucks
im
a
big
fan
of
the
brewery
this
beer
is
a
hazy
effervescent
darkstraw
colored
beverage
bubbles
rise
constantly
and
aggressively
through
the
liquid
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
grapefruit
lemon
and
crackers
its
a
fresh
refreshing
smell
but
its
a
bit
static
and
onedimensional
nice
aroma
but
citrus
dominates
the
flavor
is
more
nuanced
theres
a
lemongrass
and
wheat
twang
flavor
backed
by
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
modest
hop
flavor
nicely
packaged
the
beer
also
hides
its
alcohol
well
it
tastes
like
a
session
beer
but
the
abv
could
be
dangerous
some
residual
sweetness
that
hints
at
heaviness
yet
the
beer
stays
refreshing
nice
beer
o
a
really
stellar
offering
from
lagunitas
i
applaud
them
for
making
really
good
beer
that
is
pretty
accessible
to
the
masses
i
could
drink
this
all
day
overall
the
smell
is
terrific
and
the
taste
follows
it
a
little
too
much
the
sweetness
can
be
a
bit
overpowering
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
would
drink
again
for
sure
mouth
is
surprisingly
heavier
than
you
would
think
from
its
appearance
very
drinkable
and
tasty
everythings
there
but
maybe
not
as
much
as
youd
like
it
to
be
definitely
solid
and
i
think
its
a
nice
refreshing
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
at
any
given
time
o
very
drinkable
not
a
style
that
i
have
experienced
often
but
definitely
one
that
i
enjoyed
i
really
liked
the
aroma
of
this
beer
o
simply
amazing
this
is
my
favorite
go
to
readily
available
beer
tons
of
fruit
flavors
being
thrown
around
you
get
sweet
you
get
bitter
all
being
combined
in
good
ways
highly
recommended
doa
wow
my
tour
through
the
pale
ales
is
showing
me
that
i
do
like
a
hoppy
beer
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
more
malt
showing
through
to
balance
the
hops
but
thats
not
going
to
stop
me
from
drinking
it
overall

is
a
very
good
beer
glad
to
know
this
is
yearround
its
pleasant
when
the
hops
have
died
off
but
i
definitely
like
this
beer
freshfreshfresh
easy
drinking
and
approachable
but
not
sacrificing
character
in
any
way
i
like
it
when
theres
some
wheat
character
thats
allowed
to
shine
through
in
a
beer
tootoo
often
the
wheat
in
a
beer
gets
washed
out
by
spices
or
superestery
yeast
notes
so
i
like
it
when
its
given
its
due
with
a
solid
ale
yeast
not
that
id
consider
this
a
particular
wheaty
brewits
more
of
a
sidenote
but
i
enjoy
it
well
done
lagunitas
keep
up
the
good
work
and
yes
im
still
waiting
for
a
bretty
hop
stoopid
this
stuff
is
great
beer
pours
a
dark
straw
with
only
a
finger
of
thick
sticky
bright
white
head
despite
being
poured
straight
down
the
center
of
a
pint
glass
tons
of
cling
as
the
head
settles
really
good
lacing
all
this
is
nice
but
the
smell
and
flavor
are
truly
spot
on
extremely
well
balanced
between
malt
and
citrus
hop
flavor
this
beer
is
like
bells
hopslams
older
smoother
more
sophisticated
brother
exceptional
beer
cheers
o
a
clean
very
hoppy
wheat
ale
suitable
for
hop
heads
i
didnt
think
this
was
a
great
apa
or
ipa
not
up
with
better
lagunitas
offerings
for
one
thing
but
as
an
amer
pale
wheat
it
is
exceptional
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
best
served
fresh
in
a
glass
to
enjoy
the
aroma
poured
into
mug
fairly
murky
orangeyellow
body
with
smaller
head
than
expected
smell
is
pretty
intense
lots
of
sweet
citrus
and
spice
flavor
is
very
much
like
an
ipa
with
a
different
mouthfeel
not
so
crispy
more
watery
this
is
basically
a
pale
ale
bordering
ipa
with
some
wheat
it
really
is
hoppy
and
well
rounded
but
just
doesnt
have
the
wow
factor
that
a
fuller
mouthful
would
give
it
all
around
bigassed
wheat
beer
tropical
fruits
citrus
and
crushed
aspirin
get
out
ahead
of
things
before
eventually
being
reeled
in
by
a
big
wheaty
body
as
it
warms
the
grainy
cereal
notes
come
out
even
more
and
the
absurd
creaminess
increases
this
is
just
a
damn
good
craft
beer
i
could
see
drinking
it
all
day
in
the
summer
except
that
the
abv
would
knock
me
on
my
ass
before
supper
overall
the
flavor
reminds
me
heavily
that
of
an
apa
or
an
ipa
more
so
than
a
wheat
ale
still
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
any
craft
beer
fan
should
check
out
oa
very
well
balanced
wheat
beer
with
nice
fruit
focus
but
not
overally
sweet
or
bitter
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
bit
a
carbonation
makes
this
ale
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
can
say
hope
lagunitas
keeps
this
pale
wheat
crossed
with
a
ipa
around
for
a
long
time
color
is
light
amber
to
a
dark
shade
of
gold
and
cloudy
lots
of
lacing
but
the
moderate
head
fades
fairly
quickly
the
smell
is
much
like
an
apa
or
ipa
nice
citrus
notes
the
wheat
character
of
this
beer
comes
through
more
in
the
taste
but
the
wheat
definitely
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
hops
there
is
just
a
touch
of
clove
and
lemon
behind
the
surge
of
grapefruit
for
my
tastes
this
beer
strikes
the
perfect
balance
between
a
pale
ale
and
a
wheat
pours
a
nice
yellow
honey
orange
and
gold
color
with
a
slight
hazy
appearance
has
a
huge
honey
comb
colored
head
that
leaves
sticky
lacy
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
huge
pineapple
orange
peel
and
some
sweet
grapefruit
there
is
a
nice
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
front
of
the
nose
and
the
malt
creeps
through
to
balance
out
the
aromas
but
this
is
definitely
hop
forward
on
the
aroma
the
taste
is
very
much
like
the
aroma
it
has
a
huge
kick
of
sweet
pineapple
and
orange
peel
i
get
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
grapefruit
rather
than
sweet
on
the
taste
but
it
works
great
with
the
other
hop
flavors
there
is
a
malt
presence
that
balances
this
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
a
total
hop
bomb
smooth
arrival
to
the
hops
and
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
for
an
ipa
really
has
a
big
kick
of
carbonation
that
cleanses
the
palate
while
opening
it
up
to
all
the
huge
flavors
this
beer
has
to
offer
not
over
sticky
or
sweet
at
all
for
such
a
high
hop
profile
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
very
accessible
i
wish
it
were
year
round
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
trying
aquired
in
a
trade
with
schufj
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
glowing
golden
hue
capped
by
a
12
white
head
with
fair
retention
nose
is
complex
and
inviting
with
caramel
backed
by
pine
and
citrus
bitterness
is
cutting
but
quickly
washed
away
with
cracker
and
caramel
sweetness
slick
but
medium
bodied
yum
o
extremely
drinkable
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
sampled
from
lagunitas
im
usually
not
super
crazy
about
wheat
beers
but
i
will
definitely
buy
this
one
again
very
enjoyable
and
definitely
makes
me
want
to
try
more
highly
regarded
apwas
overall
i
would
say
that
this
is
ridiculously
tasty
lagunitas
nails
another
west
coast
hop
forward
ale
stoopid
good
very
well
done
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
believe
that
the
other
ratings
are
justified
as
well
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
chalice
o
about
as
good
a
wheat
pale
ale
as
i
have
ever
had
i
will
be
buying
this
beer
again
o
great
refreshing
beer
with
a
dry
finish
are
the
lasting
points
here
goes
down
a
little
too
easy
for
the
alcohol
content
could
be
dangerous
o
one
of
the
best
beers
at
lagunitas
and
one
of
my
favorite
hoppy
wheat
beers
a
great
well
crafted
beer
one
of
my
faves
to
review
so
far
damn
proud
of
lagunitas
damn
proud
edit
had
no
idea
this
was
a
pale
wheat
fooled
me
way
too
good
to
be
a
wheat
super
just
super
the
hops
in
this
work
way
better
with
the
wheat
than
they
should
this
really
defies
any
categorization
as
its
more
like
an
ipa
than
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
regardless
this
is
a
great
offering
shared
a
growler
of
this
with
the
lady
over
homemade
mac
and
cheese
and
fish
stick
it
was
a
wonderful
combination
it
was
a
great
hazy
mustard
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
left
some
solid
lacing
it
smelled
of
pine
hops
citrus
and
a
hint
of
wheat
the
wheat
came
thru
more
in
the
taste
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
bells
two
hearted
ale
solid
i
hope
it
continues
to
be
readily
available
good
west
coast
ipa
a
very
drinkable
beer
fits
the
style
pretty
well
the
only
issue
i
had
was
that
i
fell
the
carbonation
level
should
have
been
higher
also
probably
a
better
summer
brew
flavor
profiles
were
spot
on
overall
very
good
well
rounded
will
drink
again
o
this
is
an
excellent
brew
drinkable
tasty
a
real
winner
too
bad
its
a
7
5
because
it
drinks
so
easy
it
makes
me
want
many
o
i
love
this
beer
and
would
make
a
session
if
it
wasnt
so
powerful
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
is
7
5
and
that
could
be
dangerous
try
this
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
would
buy
again
if
i
had
the
chance
overall
it
is
hard
to
drink
just
one
of
these
the
flavors
are
so
incredibly
balanced
and
its
such
a
beautiful
looking
beer
that
i
want
more
one
of
the
cashiers
at
the
store
said
she
bought
a
case
of
4
six
packs
and
finished
it
off
in
under
a
week
i
was
skeptical
at
first
but
im
now
determined
to
oneup
her
very
interesting
ba
lists
it
as
a
wheat
ale
based
off
my
tasting
i
wouldve
assumed
it
was
a
very
floral
ipa
im
not
sure
i
was
detecting
any
of
the
wheat
other
than
in
a
certain
light
brightness
in
the
beer
all
around
a
good
beer
but
not
super
exciting
hides
its
alcohol
well
o
i
am
a
believer
interestingtasty
beer
in
every
word
and
the
best
lagunitas
brew
ive
had
so
far
i
cant
say
i
have
any
gripes
with
this
beer
the
dominate
grapefruit
you
see
in
many
ipas
is
upfront
but
doesnt
linger
after
finish
i
guess
the
only
sense
of
a
wheat
beer
is
the
finish
but
its
settle
besides
that
i
would
classify
this
as
an
ipa
good
beer
worthy
of
my
shelf
go
pick
up
a
six
pack
not
sure
i
get
the
wheat
except
maybe
in
the
feel
but
this
is
a
great
extremely
drinkable
pale
ale
interested
to
drink
this
side
by
side
with
lagunitas
pa
shame
its
too
strong
to
session
o
a
very
delicious
beer
addendum
noticed
its

an

beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
over
and
over
malt
cheers
big
grapefruit
and
citrus
flavors
come
out
of
the
hops
the
flavor
is
intense
and
bold
hitting
all
of
the
tastebuds
and
then
rescinding
quickly
so
that
you
cant
wait
for
the
next
sip
theres
a
balance
from
the
malts
that
takes
the
edge
off
the
sharply
bitter
hops
just
enough
so
that
they
can
be
enjoyed
to
their
fullest
extent
without
making
you
pucker
not
much
of
a
boozy
taste
so
the
7
5
abv
has
the
potential
to
sneak
up
on
you
the
mouthfeel
helps
along
the
carrying
of
the
hop
message
with
its
moderately
high
carbonation
and
ultracrisp
dry
finish
perfect
for
the
style
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
just
for
the
sake
of
relaxation
after
a
hot
summer
day
or
for
analyzing
and
dissecting
the
flavors
one
of
my
favorites
from
lagunitas
cheers
this
is
delicious
ale
and
a
surprise
from
lagunitas
which
mostly
has
not
overly
impressed
me
with
their
offerings
but
with
this
they
have
hit
a
home
run
very
very
drinkable
even
though
the
abv
is
7
5
the
abv
is
never
noticeable
a
unique
taste
different
from
any
other
ale
i
can
think
of
at
this
time
definitely
worth
buying
by
the
case
even
though
it
is
a
little
pricey
in
my
area
at
around
48
note
even
my
light
beer
buddies
liked
this
one
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
with
good
retention
seems
to
be
pretty
well
filtered
smells
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
a
nice
sweet
smell
and
some
bread
malts
feel
very
tingly
good
carbonation
medium
and
silky
taste
is
pretty
good
you
get
loads
of
sweet
malts
up
front
a
little
herbal
notes
perhaps
a
little
sweet
banana
tasting
yeast
esters
and
on
the
end
you
get
plenty
of
floral
hoppy
goodness
and
grapefruit
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
the
high
abv
is
very
well
masked
o
a
delicious
beer
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
great
beer
not
intensely
bitter
yet
full
of
hop
flavor
and
satisfying
wheat
malt
o
im
not
gonna
say
this
is
a
sessionable
brew
because
of
the
abv
but
it
certainly
drinks
like
one
delicious
refreshing
and
fantastic
126pack
is
probably
a
bit
much
but
ive
never
had
it
and
really
wanted
to
try
it
well
done
once
again
lagunitas
o
damn
good
wheat
beer
i
love
the
hoppiness
that
comes
to
the
table
in
this
one
this
beer
is
golden
colored
and
clear
nice
head
at
first
that
fades
to
nothing
but
a
white
ring
aroma
is
filled
with
orange
candy
pineapple
floral
hops
lightly
toasted
bread
and
various
other
delightful
happy
aromas
i
am
enjoying
every
fragrant
sniff
taste
is
full
of
hoppy
goodness
both
bitter
and
flavor
more
yummy
bread
malt
and
fresh
grains
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
grainyresiny
texture
to
it
and
underneath
that
its
smooth
good
level
of
carbonation
and
medium
to
light
body
very
drinkable
indeed
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
high
carbonation
and
nice
frothy
white
head
smells
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
i
get
mango
pineapple
and
sticky
sweet
hop
nectar
smells
like
a
tropical
fruit
salad
a
sweet
light
to
medium
beer
with
a
rush
of
piney
hop
taste
that
gives
to
some
orange
citrus
hop
zest
quite
bitter
can
almost
feel
the
hop
resins
coat
my
teeth
a
very
nice
summer
beer
loaded
on
hops
the
abv
does
kick
in
after
a
number
of
these
daddys
will
be
looking
for
this
one
again
to
quench
my
longing
for
hop
flavor
and
summer
thirst
well
done
poured
into
a
22
oz
pintstyle
glass
more
room
for
a
hard
pour
as
it
poured
it
looked
very
yellow
but
once
in
the
glass
it
settled
into
a
solid
golden
color
with
a
good
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
first
sniff
yielded
floral
hop
aromas
and
for
some
reason
on
the
first
sniff
peach
yeah
i
know
it
sounds
odd
but
thats
what
i
smelled
and
i
did
like
it
it
drifted
into
the
fruityfloral
hops
scent
after
that
taste
reflected
the
label
with
hops
in
the
ingredients
listing
hops
several
times
hoppy
with
a
clean
crisp
finish
all
in
all
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
that
i
would
get
again
i
wouldnt
mind
giving
it
a
taste
on
tap
i
love
it
awesome
beer
the
bitterness
of
many
ipas
with
a
nice
sweet
fruitiness
underneath
that
provides
excellent
balance
a
great
ale
overall
not
only
is
this
my
favorite
lagunitas
beer
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
of
all
styles
ridiculously
refreshing
on
a
sultry
south
florida
day
you
must
try
this
beer
an
interesting
style
but
ipa
lovers
will
adore
this
beer
top
notch
poured
a
bright
golden
color
slightly
hazy
the
head
was
medium
and
i
had
noce
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
to
me
wass
ipaish
with
a
pronounced
grapefruit
and
grassy
aroma
mmm
i
didnt
expect
this
but
am
now
excited
to
have
bought
this
the
taste
was
also
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
than
a
wheat
beer
the
grapefruit
type
taste
hit
me
first
maybe
a
litte
wheat
in
the
background
but
just
sweep
hop
and
fruity
taste
all
the
way
through
mouthfeel
was
awesome
what
a
great
beer
i
cant
believe
it
took
me
this
long
to
try
one
ill
be
back
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
pours
a
bright
pale
golden
body
with
a
fizzy
generous
head
smell
has
a
citrus
hop
profile
with
some
sharpness
taste
is
incredible
with
a
ton
of
lemon
and
orange
hop
notes
with
a
crisp
wheat
backbone
kind
of
reminds
me
of
gumballhead
but
less
wheat
and
fruitier
hops
this
beer
is
really
really
good
mouthfeel
is
awesome
try
this
one
you
wont
be
sorry
lightly
carbonated
sour
puckering
gives
a
wetness
to
the
palate
and
kind
of
coats
the
warmness
from
the
alcohol
o
definitely
a
very
tastyvery
drinkable
beer
love
the
malts
calming
the
bitterness
down
as
much
as
it
does
although
i
do
love
the
assault
of
hops
every
now
and
then
gave
this
a
second
try
as
of
0714
this
is
either
a
very
good
ipa
or
a
failure
of
a
wheat
ale
like
somebody
got
a
little
too
clever
for
their
own
good
hey
lets
just
keep
adding
hops
pretty
much
an
ipa
honestly
if
they
knocked
it
down
to
5
or
so
i
think
it
would
be
even
better
and
more
refreshing
oh
well
fruity
candied
stickiness
cant
complain
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
of
it
when
poured
into
a
glass
there
is
a
fantastic
citrusy
aroma
of
it
it
goes
down
smooth
i
have
never
been
disappointed
with
a
lagunitas
and
this
one
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
o
im
impressed
ive
had
very
few
offerings
from
lagunitas
but
this
is
a
great
beer
im
usually
underwhelmed
by
wheat
beers
but
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
well
balanced
great
for
a
summer
beer
or
fall
beer
or
spring
beer
hell
even
winter
fairly
simple
and
straightforward
but
just
all
around
good
one
of
the
best
beer
bargains
out
there
for
10
worth
of
summer
drinking
you
cant
do
much
better
for
a
six
pack
cheers
i
really
dug
this
beer
and
didnt
realize
it
was
a
wheat
until
after
i
had
drunk
it
theres
not
much
wheat
flavor
and
its
closer
to
an
caliapa
in
style
wow
its
good
slightly
opaque
light
gold
color
floral
hops
in
the
nose
continue
in
the
mouth
with
balanced
flavors
and
restrained
bitterness
tremendously
drinkable
a
delicious
beer
that
i
cant
wait
to
drink
again
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
think
everyone
should
try
do
it
i
will
try
it
again
and
again
a
little
syrupy
but
overall
crisp
and
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
and
nicely
balanced
beer
flavor
had
a
light
touch
of
bready
crackery
malt
and
was
a
touch
dry
and
crisp
lots
of
citrus
was
present
with
rindy
pithy
characteristics
aplenty
pineapple
and
grapefruit
came
into
play
in
this
solid
offering
the
hoppiness
in
the
finish
was
longlasting
and
pleasant
reminded
me
a
bit
of
schneiderbrooklyner
hefeweizen
good
stuff
o
solid
stuff
from
lagunitas
little
sumpin
sumpin
pours
out
a
golden
amber
with
a
thin
half
inch
head
scent
is
apricot
wheat
mango
pineapple
orange
and
grapefruit
taste
is
predominately
apricot
and
wheat
with
some
lemon
dropping
in
on
the
finish
and
lingering
around
mouthfeel
is
velvetysmooth
outasight
overall
a
very
smooth
and
drinkable
pale
wheat
ale
despite
the
abv
one
of
my
goto
six
pack
purchases
along
with
racer
5
on
tap
at
beer
run
in
charlottesville
va
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
wheat
until
i
read
about
it
i
would
consider
this
an
almost
ideal
american
pale
ale
nice
appearance
in
the
glass
slight
haze
plenty
of
head
and
lace
on
the
glass
bursting
with
american
hop
aroma
excellent
malthop
flavor
balance
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
a
great
beer
that
may
win
over
those
who
shy
away
from
hoppy
beers
i
was
so
impressed
by
the
quality
of
this
beer
that
i
had
another
despite
the
large
selection
on
tap
at
beer
run
one
of
the
best
this
is
a
go
to
beer
for
me
and
im
glad
have
a
minute
to
review
it
first
time
i
had
it
was
at
brewtopia
in
nyc
and
was
blown
away
had
no
idea
it
was
an
apa
thought
it
was
a
lights
ipa
now
that
ive
been
drinking
it
regularly
it
is
my
go
too
chillin
in
the
pool
summer
beer
ok
enough
blah
blah
blah
pours
like
a
golden
lagerish
color
with
a
fluffy
white
dissipating
head
lacing
the
glass
lightly
smell
is
slightly
citrusy
sour
some
pine
and
overall
inviting
the
taste
allows
for
the
hops
to
blow
you
away
if
your
expecting
a
wheat
bear
or
have
you
grinning
a
bit
if
your
expecting
an
ipa
i
can
taste
the
bittering
grapefruit
and
some
unripe
apricots
as
well
as
sweet
peppers
and
believe
it
or
not
a
little
wheat
beer
on
the
burp
the
mouthfeel
is
light
as
hell
and
very
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
despite
the
high
abv
overall
freakin
great
another
thumbs
up
to
lagunitas
will
gladly
pick
up
more
than
one
next
timne
after
this
worthwhile
trial
keep
in
mind
im
an
ipadouble
ipa
fan
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
for
me
if
youre
all
about
the
wheat
this
may
not
be
exactly
what
your
reaching
for
o
a
fine
drinking
beer
for
anytime
of
year
o
decent
but
im
surprised
im
not
as
impressed
as
others
here
seem
to
be
i
totally
love
the
sumpin
extra
ipa
but
then
again
this
is
a
wheat
beer
this
one
just
doesnt
come
together
as
nicely
for
me
overall
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
it
wasnt
anything
like
the
other
pale
wheats
ive
had
before
this
one
was
too
hoppy
for
me
i
was
expecting
a
more
balanced
flavor
of
hops
and
wheat
but
i
couldnt
taste
the
wheatiness
that
i
loved
in
other
pale
wheats
just
the
hops
and
bitterness
overall
very
impressive
drink
its
a
little
strong
for
a
wheat
ale
but
really
this
isnt
anything
like
traditonal
wheat
ales
7
5
and
hoppy
this
could
pass
for
a
ipa
very
tasty
and
hoppy
overall
a
very
satisfying
wheat
beer
hardly
surprisingi
learned
to
expect
great
things
from
lagunitas
a
long
time
ago
o
a
very
interesting
and
extremely
tasty
wheat
beer
a
great
amount
of
tasty
hops
balanced
with
the
wheat
malt
in
all
this
is
yet
another
great
offering
from
lagunitas
which
combines
the
best
attributes
of
a
smooth
refreshing
wheat
beer
and
the
excellent
taste
of
an
ipa
no
wonder
this
is
quickly
becoming
my
new
goto
summer
beer
drink
i
like
this
one
a
lot
its
similar
to
an
ipa
but
just
smaller
and
tastier
id
like
this
one
again
was
quite
balanced
and
tasty
o
wow
hoppy
wheat
im
a
fan
great
beer
very
drinkable
and
went
down
way
to
easy
poured
into
a
pint
glass
thick
white
two
finger
head
straw
colored
and
clear
with
ample
carbonation
and
some
lacing
smells
of
orange
and
hops
with
a
touch
of
wheat
the
taste
is
of
hops
and
orange
with
alcohol
and
bitterness
being
a
noticable
factor
but
not
unpleasent
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
overall
a
very
solid
beer
but
just
a
tad
hoppy
for
a
wheat
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
golden
color
the
head
is
strong
and
fluffy
looking
the
lacing
isnt
bad
either
the
smell
is
hoppy
i
actually
thought
this
was
an
ipa
not
a
wheat
ale
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
light
wheat
flavor
but
finished
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
on
this
beer
is
smooth
and
crisp
its
got
a
good
bite
to
it
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
pretty
good
all
around
worth
having
again
o
very
very
impressive
i
couldnt
stop
taking
sips
of
this
bad
boy
before
i
knew
it
the
glass
was
empty
well
done
lagunitas
if
youd
start
putting
descriptions
on
your
beers
i
would
probably
drink
a
lot
more
of
you
o
one
of
my
go
to
beers
i
am
not
typically
the
biggest
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
is
fantastic
when
fresh
overall
lagunitas
rarely
disappoints
me
this
is
no
exception
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
is
always
in
my
fridge
during
summer
4
55
a
very
good
beer
i
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
try
this
it
has
plenty
of
big
hoppy
flavor
but
its
all
about
flavor
and
not
just
about
hops
overall
another
winner
from
the
good
people
of
petaluma
overall
this
is
my
first
and
definitely
not
last
goround
with
sumpin
sumpin
and
color
me
impressed
really
digging
this
beer
would
be
perfect
for
a
summer
barbecue
mouthfeel
dried
out
my
mouth
medium
body
lagunitas
is
impressing
me
more
more
looking
forward
to
sampling
the
rest
of
their
offerings
in
due
time
this
ones
incredibly
drinkable
i
could
easily
keep
this
one
stocked
in
the
fridge
all
year
or
at
least
all
summer
this
definitely
is
one
of
the
hoppier
wheat
beers
i
have
tried
or
it
could
just
pass
as
an
ipa
brewed
with
some
wheat
either
definition
works
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
especially
considering
the
abv
o
i
will
get
this
beer
again
great
for
the
price
refreshing
enough
on
hot
days
yet
malty
enough
to
scratch
an
itch
if
you
want
something
a
little
heavier
this
is
a
hop
forward
wheat
ale
i
kind
of
wished
the
balance
was
a
bit
better
the
malt
bill
is
a
little
weak
in
my
opinion
although
i
thought
it
was
good
and
worthwhile
ive
had
better
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
has
a
bright
orangetan
coloring
to
it
with
no
head
whatsoever
pours
out
with
minimal
carbonation
bubbling
also
aromas
are
hoppy
with
a
slight
citrus
and
nutty
sweet
blend
to
it
well
balanced
but
somewhat
awkward
for
some
reason
the
flavors
are
light
on
the
forward
tongue
but
burst
onto
the
middle
and
rear
tongue
with
light
crisp
hops
a
heavy
dose
of
pepper
spicing
citrus
tart
and
sweet
and
a
slight
toasty
and
breadlike
character
the
body
remains
light
and
crisp
true
to
the
style
but
slightly
watery
initially
the
aftertaste
is
light
on
the
spice
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
flavors
and
an
even
bigger
amount
of
citrus
sweetness
and
a
slight
hint
of
pineapple
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
with
the
slightest
dryness
from
the
hops
very
tasty
overall
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
actually
i
love
it
it
is
like
a
blend
of
an
ipa
and
wheat
beer
all
in
one
another
unique
offering
by
this
brewer
and
they
have
shown
the
knack
for
avoiding
the
run
of
the
mill
brews
it
seems
strange
to
call
a
7
5
abv
64
ibu
beer
sessionable
maybe
thats
going
to
far
but
i
would
say
this
is
a
lighter
softer
summer
friendly
ipa
that
doesnt
seem
to
sacrifice
anything
in
the
hop
department
to
achieve
its
aformentioned
qualities
damn
fine
work
by
the
guys
at
lagunitas
i
like
this
american
pale
wheat
in
fact
it
is
my
first
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
the
head
is
thick
and
sticks
around
all
the
way
to
the
last
sip
the
smell
is
that
of
an
american
pale
ale
there
is
a
just
enough
hops
but
not
that
big
bite
very
pleasant
and
very
drinkable
this
went
down
fairly
quickly
i
want
more
of
these
i
thought
this
was
a
very
unique
tasting
beer
if
you
like
apas
and
wheat
beers
this
is
a
great
choice
o
a
fantastic
and
really
interesting
beer
recommended
for
hopheads
and
lovers
of
grapefruit
this
is
my
second
in
a
week
and
i
think
ill
go
buy
a
few
more
o
this
is
like
an
ipa
with
a
bit
of
wheat
and
a
nice
clean
finish
with
minimal
bitterness
very
nice
and
easy
to
drink
honestly
i
was
pretty
stunned
as
to
how
good
this
was
it
was
just
a
smidge
below
gumballhead
in
my
opinion
one
of
my
new
favorites
overall
another
outstanding
beer
from
lagunitas
again
lagunitas
leaves
me
wanting
more
i
recommend
this
to
any
hop
lovers
or
wheat
beer
lovers
looking
to
branch
out
this
beer
is
one
of
those
super
hoppy
american
wheat
ales
that
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
if
you
are
into
american
pale
ales
gumball
head
is
still
my
favorite
of
this
style
but
this
one
is
quite
tasty
and
widely
available
leftcoast
hops
and
wheat
malt
maybe
not
the
first
beer
to
feature
this
dynamic
duo
but
arguably
one
of
the
best
examples
of
it
slight
wheat
beer
haze
with
a
solid
white
head
that
retreats
to
a
persistent
ring
lots
of
classic
leftcoast
citrus
hops
in
the
nose
with
some
pine
and
grapefruit
supporting
the
lemony
main
note
bitterness
is
solid
but
in
proportion
for
a
beer
of
medium
body
at
half
this
strength
itd
make
a
great
lawnmower
beer
but
full
strength
it
is
and
that
limits
it
to
a
few
rounds
unless
hops
aint
your
thing
its
hard
to
find
any
fault
with
this
brew
overall
nice
the
hops
go
well
with
the
wheat
base
o
this
is
a
good
solid
ipa
with
a
little
bit
of
a
twist
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
not
quite
as
radical
as
i
thought
itd
be
and
it
doesnt
really
stand
above
others
in
this
segment
enough
to
sell
your
first
born
to
get
it
but
its
easy
to
see
how
lssa
could
become
someones
goto
brew
love
this
beer
fresh
now
that
its
year
round
that
will
be
a
little
harder
to
accomplish
on
the
east
coast
ill
be
sure
to
look
for
the
bottling
dates
on
future
batches
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
has
a
good
balance
blend
of
hops
and
the
malt
bill
is
subtle
but
compliments
the
ensemble
that
said
i
am
a
malthead
so
this
one
finished
just
a
bit
bitter
for
my
taste
but
it
was
still
pretty
nice
to
the
back
of
your
throat
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
my
sixpack
no
doubt
though
i
am
not
sure
when
the
urge
will
strike
me
to
buy
this
again
just
for
pleasure
the
mouthfeel
ranks
in
at
medium
no
doubt
from
the
generous
use
of
wheat
malt
a
very
well
made
beer
overall
this
beer
is
very
much
drinkable
is
very
high
on
my
list
one
that
i
am
so
very
glad
is
not
a
limited
release
will
be
a
staple
in
my
rotation
prosit
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
and
oily
slick
with
light
fizzy
carbonation
a
light
to
medium
body
and
a
bitter
zesty
finish
a
high
recommendation
for
a
great
beer
that
is
extremely
drinkable
as
i
had
4
on
tap
last
light
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
again
soon
as
it
was
excellent
o
good
all
around
balanced
hop
and
malt
d
very
drinkable
nothing
really
sticks
to
the
mouth
at
all
and
is
really
easy
drinking
overall
a
really
flavorful
wheat
pale
ale
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
balance
the
sweetness
and
good
flavors
all
around
not
too
weak
on
the
flavors
like
many
wheat
pale
ales
and
a
respectable
abv
another
winner
from
lagunitas
overall
a
good
twist
to
the
american
ipa
style
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
a
fantastic
summer
beer
for
hop
lovers
track
this
down
poured
into
13oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
clear
orange
yellow
nice
1
inch
white
sticky
head
this
beer
is
different
then
any
beer
out
like
a
sweet
ipa
smell
is
mango
pappia
pineapple
grapefruit
and
piney
hops
taste
is
all
that
but
stronger
a
little
alcohol
in
the
finish
medium
body
and
very
easy
to
drink
just
a
wonderful
and
unique
beer
everyone
want
a
lil
sumpin
sumpin
another
solid
creation
by
lagunitas
the
color
is
golden
clear
with
not
much
carbonation
so
the
head
is
very
very
thin
almost
nonexsistent
the
nose
is
accented
by
grapefruitcitrus
and
you
can
sense
a
full
bodyness
to
it
the
taste
is
very
good
with
citrus
hints
and
body
the
mouthfeel
is
good
lil
punchy
with
the
higher
abv
in
general
im
a
fan
of
what
lagunitas
puts
out
but
im
sorry
to
report
that
this
particular
release
has
been
hard
to
get
down
this
lil
sumpin
has
got
sumpin
not
quite
right
about
it
o
damn
just
a
great
beer
lagunitis
you
are
quickly
moving
up
on
my
brewery
list
overall
wheat
ipa
not
too
surprising
coming
from
lagunitas
flavorful
complex
and
refreshing
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
anytime
its
very
well
balanced
and
the
taste
is
delicious
it
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
the
aprihop
beer
by
dogfish
head
if
i
had
to
drink
one
type
of
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
it
would
be
along
the
lines
of
this
one
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
an
excellent
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
wonderful
hop
aroma
its
basically
an
ipa
brewed
with
wheat
the
taste
is
great
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
easy
drinking
with
a
kick
ass
hop
character
its
malty
with
an
equally
bold
hop
appeal
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
delicious
beer
its
a
bolder
american
wheat
ale
with
loads
of
hop
my
kind
of
beer
food
pairing
pork
chicken
bbq
items
rubbed
sauced
smoked
whatever
pretty
perfect
grill
brew
ham
medium
cheeses
goat
cheese
would
go
great
with
this
tofu
fried
foods
anything
really
not
a
real
beef
kind
of
brew
but
anything
else
that
comes
to
mind
would
go
good
delicious
seek
it
out
i
definitely
get
more
ipa
than
wheat
which
is
probably
why
i
like
it
overall
its
different
certainly
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
especially
for
its
abv
overall
this
might
be
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
had
it
drinks
far
more
like
an
ipa
than
any
other
wheat
style
beer
that
ive
had
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
will
certainly
be
in
rotation
this
summer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
scent
is
very
hoppy
with
some
nice
wheat
aromas
as
well
i
also
get
some
earthiness
and
grassy
aromas
even
hints
of
meat
taste
is
initially
tropical
and
citrus
fruit
forward
then
i
get
some
floral
flavors
the
wheat
is
definitely
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
nice
grassy
and
delicious
hop
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
crisp
to
perfection
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
a
great
offering
from
lagunitas
and
just
in
time
for
the
summer
pours
a
great
golden
yellow
with
a
slight
orangish
tinge
a
small
amount
of
white
head
formed
as
well
the
smell
is
hoppy
freshness
with
a
slight
hint
of
wheat
and
light
malt
smell
the
flavor
is
really
well
balanced
with
the
wheat
hitting
first
only
to
then
finish
with
that
fresh
hop
flavor
goes
down
smooth
and
is
a
really
refreshing
beer
a
great
summer
drink
that
i
will
soon
drink
again
overall
great
great
brew
tastes
and
feels
like
an
ipa
but
as
easy
to
drink
as
a
wittbier
one
word
stunning
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
moderate
head
made
up
of
small
interlocking
bubbles
aroma
is
hoppy
with
some
big
citrus
notes
im
picking
up
oranges
coming
to
the
forefront
the
wheat
character
is
there
but
its
subdued
if
i
was
tasting
this
blind
i
probably
would
call
it
an
ipa
or
pale
ale
based
on
the
aroma
taste
is
pretty
stunning
i
had
several
of
these
the
other
day
and
they
went
down
smooth
and
easy
this
beer
is
bursting
at
the
seams
with
flavor
with
huge
fruity
ipa
notes
hitting
the
palate
first
chased
by
wonderful
malt
thats
highlighted
by
the
wheat
not
all
that
bitter
which
is
nice
in
a
beer
like
this
the
second
sip
showcases
more
of
the
hop
profile
with
big
pine
and
grass
notes
this
time
malt
flavor
errs
on
the
sweet
side
rather
than
the
dry
which
means
that
this
one
goes
down
quick
and
easy
and
at
7
3
abv
thats
something
you
may
want
to
monitor
carbonation
is
relatively
high
but
given
the
wheat
character
and
malt
sweetness
thats
actually
welcome
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
its
easy
to
drink
like
a
wheat
beer
fantastic
and
unique
serving
type
bought
bottles
as
well
its
better
on
tap
more
aromatic
as
well
with
a
name
like
that
how
could
i
resist
it
was
pretty
good
crisp
and
refreshing
as
a
wheat
beer
should
be
poured
a
pale
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
floral
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
citrus
zest
similar
qualities
in
the
taste
floral
citrus
a
touch
of
spice
and
sweet
malts
in
the
background
lightmedium
body
crisp
and
drinkable
hazy
brass
colored
pour
with
a
slight
head
that
leaves
little
to
no
lace
the
brassy
hued
brew
is
only
mildly
carbonated
great
hopa
nd
malt
balance
really
nice
hop
finish
behind
a
sweet
malt
overtone
the
piney
hops
dont
overpower
the
malt
sweetness
but
rather
compliment
the
malt
profiles
very
tastey
and
drinkable
beer
pours
a
nice
copper
color
smells
great
you
get
a
nice
peach
aroma
that
goes
along
with
pine
some
sugar
in
the
aroma
as
well
and
it
has
some
malt
the
taste
starts
off
with
that
pinecitrus
it
finishes
with
a
chalk
like
texture
just
slightly
overall
i
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
but
it
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
thought
the
aroma
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
it
has
its
good
qualities
but
i
wouldnt
buy
anymore
anytime
soon
o
pretty
delicious
brew
with
a
great
hop
bite
smooth
and
refreshing
brew
i
couldnt
taste
any
alcohol
to
this
beer
even
though
it
certainly
is
there
thats
the
strength
of
this
brew
without
a
doubt
it
went
down
so
easily
but
never
did
it
feel
weak
or
watered
down
im
not
sure
how
it
was
pulled
off
but
this
is
a
warmweather
beer
that
doesnt
have
the
weakness
that
the
lawnmower
beers
have
and
everyone
should
get
a
little
something
every
now
and
then
even
if
it
comes
from
a
bottle
such
as
this
overall
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
reminds
me
slightly
of
gumballhead
but
not
quite
as
tasty
a
floralhopped
wheat
beer
very
drinkable
but
i
have
some
issues
if
you
are
a
light
weight
you
can
only
have
like
2
since
these
are
over
7
the
flavor
is
very
delicious
and
the
lightness
of
the
wheat
is
amazing
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
comes
across
with
a
crisp
and
slightly
dry
refreshing
quality
to
it
overall
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
is
not
just
a
funny
name
designed
to
sell
beer
it
has
the
flavor
to
back
it
up
hoppy
wheats
are
a
great
treat
ogreat
summer
beer
cant
wait
to
crack
one
of
these
when
the
temperature
rises
o
fantastic
beer
just
get
some
burnt
straw
color
that
forms
a
decent
white
head
that
disintegrates
rather
quickly
nice
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
earthy
hops
wheat
and
grass
very
refreshing
taste
a
little
bitter
upfront
but
that
is
balanced
out
with
a
nice
refreshing
wheat
finish
good
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
i
would
consider
this
gumballheads
twin
brother
not
identical
twin
but
pretty
close
has
all
of
the
characteristics
to
make
this
a
top
tier
beer
and
putting
this
in
the
same
class
as
gumballhead
is
an
outstanding
compliment
well
done
lagunitas
d
this
beer
is
crisp
and
smooth
it
drinks
more
like
a
session
but
also
some
some
bite
to
it
a
solid
beer
to
have
on
a
nice
warm
day
pours
a
semiclear
light
honey
orange
color
with
a
small
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
decent
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
sweet
grains
honey
and
citrus
zest
hops
taste
is
of
sweet
honey
grapefruit
juice
biscuit
and
citrus
zest
the
honey
flavor
is
really
noticeable
to
me
and
its
very
delicious
very
very
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
good
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
that
makes
form
a
crisp
and
clean
feel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
surprising
honey
taste
i
am
surprised
to
see
that
it
is
a
wheat
ale
i
am
not
too
sure
if
this
one
is
past
its
prime
i
have
been
sitting
on
it
for
months
because
the
hops
arent
too
overwhelming
but
this
is
good
either
way
doverall
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
almost
tasted
like
an
ipa
but
the
wheaty
grainess
made
you
remember
it
was
a
wheat
beer
id
love
to
have
this
again
nice
beer
overall
i
love
it
another
terrific
beer
from
lagunitas
o
all
in
all
incredible
beer
great
beer
to
default
to
on
a
regular
basis
loved
it
and
look
forward
to
another
growler
poured
a
light
amber
color
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
small
amount
of
white
head
with
mild
retention
of
the
lacing
aroma
is
of
flowers
hops
and
citrus
the
aroma
carries
over
into
the
taste
mild
mouthfeel
this
is
a
super
tasty
refreshing
brew
love
it
o
a
decent
beer
here
the
alcohol
on
this
is
well
hid
it
is
a
nice
change
from
a
hefe
or
ipa
if
you
are
looking
for
one
a
nice
offering
although
if
inspired
by
three
floyds
gumballhead
it
really
doesnt
match
up
gumballhead
is
so
much
more
balanced
and
nuanced
this
is
bold
and
for
the
most
part
well
done
but
appears
hamhanded
next
to
a
brew
like
gumballhead
but
thats
just
my
opinion
once
again
lagunitas
leaves
me
impressed
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
their
beers
but
every
one
that
i
have
had
has
been
stellar
obviously
i
loved
this
beer
im
really
starting
to
become
a
believer
in
lagunitas
time
after
time
they
impress
the
hell
out
of
me
will
revisit
this
beer
in
about
right
now
cheers
pours
a
hazy
orangish
gold
with
a
good
amount
of
white
frothy
head
smells
really
wonderful
light
hops
over
sweet
wheat
a
nice
light
fruitiness
on
the
nose
tastes
as
ot
sells
sweet
and
hoppy
especially
for
a
pale
wheat
lots
of
great
lighter
fruit
on
he
tongue
with
pine
and
grape
fruit
coming
through
on
the
hops
very
solid
brew
overall
definitely
wish
i
had
access
to
this
this
is
a
wheat
beer
could
have
fooled
me
wouldve
never
guessed
outside
its
light
and
slightly
cloudy
color
this
wasnt
an
american
pale
ale
grapefruit
all
over
the
place
eeeasy
drinker
surprising
for
weighing
in
at
the
7
5
abv
my
only
wish
is
that
the
balance
leaned
more
towards
wheat
than
the
pale
ale
side
o
not
as
refreshing
as
a
straight
ipa
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
citrus
and
hops
taste
is
good
citrus
hops
a
touch
of
wheat
not
really
what
i
expected
from
this
style
but
good
nonetheless
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
serving
type
12
oz
bottle
goddamn
goddamn
goddamn
i
love
this
beer
ive
said
it
three
times
and
ill
say
it
again
i
fucking
love
this
beer
and
no
less
than
wanton
profanity
will
suffice
in
as
many
ways
as
its
an
ipa
its
something
else
entirely
thick
sticky
and
creamy
on
the
tongue
tastes
of
copious
copious
and
sugarysweet
citric
hops
with
a
rich
sturdy
undercurrent
of
everything
from
chocolate
to
grapefruit
to
an
evergreen
tree
and
a
euphoric
alcohol
warming
sensation
like
mumma
rubbin
vicks
on
yo
tummy
one
of
my
favorites
i
find
myself
all
over
the
map
on
this
one
i
like
it
but
find
it
odd
and
taxing
i
want
more
but
then
feel
ive
had
enough
little
sumpin
sumpin
ok
ill
try
a
little
mo
notes
a
lively
fruity
hop
profile
makes
this
much
better
than
your
average
american
pale
wheat
ale
a
very
tasty
treat
a
great
transition
beer
as
well
the
inexperienced
beer
drinker
can
cut
his
or
her
teeth
on
it
and
use
it
as
a
stepping
stone
to
some
of
the
harderhitting
hoppy
beers
the
body
on
this
seems
a
bit
heavier
than
i
would
like
on
the
style
even
a
little
sticky
not
a
bad
beer
very
enjoyable
glad
to
see
this
in
six
packs
relatively
locally
from
first
taste
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
citric
acid
bite
upfront
it
has
to
be
from
the
heavy
amount
of
hops
on
top
of
the
crisp
clean
wheat
a
smooth
caramel
sweet
body
that
finishes
with
a
hard
but
pleasant
bite
the
bite
become
less
overwhelming
as
it
goes
light
but
complex
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
on
the
first
day
over
60f
day
in
mass
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
this
beer
was
heavy
on
the
hops
almost
could
be
called
a
wheat
ipa
the
hops
blended
nicely
with
the
wheat
flavors
but
it
didnt
let
much
wheat
come
through
i
was
surprised
how
smooth
this
beer
was
for
being
7
5
it
drank
more
like
a
nice
pale
ale
this
would
make
a
great
summertime
brew
i
will
for
sure
be
buying
this
again
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
likes
a
good
dose
of
hops
in
their
beer
another
in
the
line
of
wheat
brews
who
have
copied
the
success
of
three
floyds
gumballhead
with
an
extra
hop
base
o
i
was
impressed
that
brewers
were
able
to
capture
strong
complexity
for
such
a
bitter
hoppy
brew
overall
i
felt
that
the
bitterness
was
way
overpowering
leaving
my
mouth
dried
out
i
could
only
handle
2
bottles
before
this
characteristic
became
overwhelming
the
beer
is
somewhere
between
a
refreshing
brew
and
a
hoppy
flavorful
sipper
for
me
making
it
tough
to
find
times
when
im
in
a
mood
for
a
beer
of
such
characteristics
do
i
wouldnt
go
as
far
and
say
this
is
the
best
of
its
style
but
it
is
certainly
up
there
its
so
refreshing
and
clean
to
drink
that
you
could
totally
sit
around
a
fire
and
drink
a
few
of
these
and
be
as
happy
as
you
possibly
could
be
the
alcohol
in
this
was
greatly
masked
and
allows
you
to
keep
drinking
without
it
tasting
like
a
shot
in
each
sip
all
in
all
wonderful
another
thanks
to
illudiumq36
for
a
great
beer
this
is
a
really
unique
beer
but
an
exceptional
one
at
that
great
for
spring
and
summer
alike
this
is
a
great
brew
has
the
sweet
hop
fruitiness
and
isnt
bitter
and
is
balanced
beautifully
by
the
wheat
maltiness
can
be
sessioned
by
the
case
stellar
stuff
perfect
for
a
bbq
or
a
hot
day
hell
anytime
of
year
this
would
be
a
nice
alternate
to
a
hefe
or
a
striaght
wheat
brew
for
some
great
stuff
if
you
havent
had
this
beer
yet
put
it
on
your
list
it
is
by
far
the
best
offering
by
lagunitas
and
has
had
me
coming
back
for
more
mo
very
wellcarbonated
refreshing
loving
the
hops
selection
used
here
surprised
this
isnt
labeled
an
ipa
definitely
worth
multiple
purchases
absolutely
great
springsummer
session
o
an
exceptional
beer
perfect
for
the
springsummer
months
hoppiness
is
there
but
not
overwhelming
the
citrus
fruit
flavor
makes
this
one
easy
to
drink
and
makes
me
keep
wanting
another
sip
drinkability
is
good
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
very
tasty
in
its
own
right
definitely
an
enjoyable
beer
o
an
aboslutely
delightful
beer
nice
hop
malt
balance
and
very
drinkable
i
dont
really
know
how
to
classify
this
beer
except
that
it
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
upon
opening
theres
a
hint
of
citrus
dont
get
fooled
by
the
appearance
of
this
beer
because
its
bot
a
little
bite
to
it
as
well
as
a
great
rounded
hoppyness
overall
a
very
tasty
and
easydrinking
beer
with
better
than
average
complexity
for
the
style
but
a
sneakily
high
abv
considering
how
smooth
it
goes
down
this
is
a
perfect
springsummer
beer
if
you
want
something
a
little
stronger
in
a
session
beer
as
i
said
before
this
brew
is
delicious
the
abv
is
a
little
higher
than
desired
for
an
everyday
drinker
but
thats
the
only
flaw
minor
at
that
this
has
completely
transformed
my
previous
view
of
lagunitas
o
amazing
beer
the
tropical
fruitiness
gives
this
brew
a
nice
juicy
character
good
for
hopheads
yet
good
for
those
who
arent
check
it
out
if
you
can
cheers
its
always
a
delight
to
see
the
slutty
sumpin
girl
back
on
the
shelves
but
she
should
be
holding
two
pineapples
in
front
of
her
boobs
because
this
beer
tastes
and
smells
judge
smells
like
pineapples
delicious
delicious
pineapples
golden
liquid
pineapples
with
a
fishbelly
white
foamy
top
oh
pineapples
thank
you
for
your
flavor
profile
in
this
beer
and
the
zippy
fun
finish
is
a
nice
reminder
of
the
slutty
girl
on
the
label
sampled
froma
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
deep
yellow
in
color
with
excellent
clarity
poured
with
a
dense
yellowishwhite
head
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
lot
of
wet
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
citrus
grapefruit
and
orange
aromas
with
along
with
plenty
of
caramel
sweetness
and
hint
of
toasty
malt
medium
bodied
with
nice
refreshing
carbonation
sweet
malty
and
citrus
grapefruit
hop
flavors
are
well
balanced
through
the
beginning
and
middle
the
wheat
flavor
peeks
through
toward
the
end
as
this
finishes
slightly
dry
and
very
clean
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
wouldnt
think
twice
about
having
it
again
lagunitas
has
yet
to
disappoint
o
very
impressive
brew
goes
to
the
top
of
my
list
in
a
heartbeat
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
pale
wheat
made
me
want
another
this
is
my
get
a
6
pack
beer
many
times
mf
medium
bodied
beer
that
has
flavors
that
really
jump
on
the
palate
a
little
dry
in
the
finish
that
leaves
slight
chalky
feeling
overall
this
is
a
really
great
beer
it
has
a
wonderful
aroma
ripe
and
crisp
fruity
flavors
that
have
enough
bitterness
to
rein
in
sweetness
and
it
is
not
too
heavy
however
the
abv
is
a
tad
bit
heavy
and
though
you
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
you
might
regret
drinking
too
many
this
beer
is
perfect
for
sunny
spring
days
that
still
have
a
bit
of
chill
or
dampness
in
the
air
why
achtung
baby
because
you
have
never
had
so
many
hops
in
your
hefeweizen
period
the
hops
are
showcased
very
well
in
this
beer
and
the
wheat
complements
it
nicely
i
really
love
the
hop
profile
on
this
beer
its
like
a
bigger
more
tropical
gumballhead
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
lagunitas
always
seems
to
come
through
for
me
mouthfeel
drinkability
easily
drinkable
and
quite
hoppy
medium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
delicious
fruit
flavors
chime
in
well
with
the
bitterness
final
thought
lagunitas
does
it
again
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
very
similar
to
my
favorite
of
this
style
fff
gumballhead
probably
the
most
refreshing
beer
i
can
get
speaking
of
which
i
am
so
glad
this
is
offered
on
a
regular
basis
and
distributed
in
my
area
this
will
always
be
in
stock
in
my
fridge
d
shit
i
mean
o
this
is
a
great
beer
considered
a
pale
ale
but
at
64
ibu
and
7
5
this
drinks
a
little
heavier
imo
i
reviewed
the
last
of
my
6pack
and
not
my
first
pack
ive
had
and
thought
i
only
had
one
left
over
to
review
i
have
put
down
quite
a
few
of
these
in
one
session
great
staple
beer
here
and
though
i
try
to
be
as
subjective
as
possible
i
will
say
that
litle
sumpin
wild
was
a
better
overall
beer
than
this
by
a
little
o
a
very
good
beer
i
enjoyed
my
glass
wholly
and
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
highly
recommended
for
anyone
looking
for
a
nontraditional
ipa
even
if
its
not
too
far
offbase
from
the
style
a
damn
fine
beervery
interesting
pleasant
and
sweetwhile
still
being
consumable
for
more
than
one
or
twoit
makes
a
good
session
brew
and
a
break
from
the
usual
another
selection
from
lagunitas
who
never
disappoints
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
i
get
a
nice
waft
of
malt
sweetness
with
a
citrus
mostly
grapefruit
smell
pours
to
a
bright
yelloworange
with
a
multisized
bubble
foamy
head
head
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
receding
taste
is
a
great
likeness
of
the
smell
taste
starts
with
a
dandelion
like
sweet
bitterness
up
front
then
transitions
into
a
heavy
malt
backbone
in
the
middle
with
a
tangy
finish
and
a
finish
similar
to
the
initial
taste
the
aftertaste
stays
bittersweet
and
fades
to
a
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
spot
on
lagunitas
continues
to
not
disappoint
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
tropical
fruit
pineapple
in
particular
and
herbalbotanical
hop
flavors
pine
becomes
more
apparent
in
the
midpalate
and
the
slight
soap
character
that
i
picked
up
on
the
nose
is
present
on
the
tongue
as
well
while
the
beer
isnt
especially
sweet
or
malty
it
does
have
a
mediumfull
body
from
the
liberal
use
of
wheat
malt
the
finish
is
smoothly
bitter
and
very
slightly
tangy
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
lagunitas
catalog
golden
bodyclear
with
a
nice
white
head
on
top
some
light
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
very
hoppy
big
citrusy
notes
with
some
tropical
fruit
flavor
as
well
tastes
a
bit
more
balanced
than
the
aroma
would
indicate
a
nice
citrusy
hop
flavor
mingles
with
a
solid
pale
malt
backbone
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
one
again
its
a
solid
beer
for
sure
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
go
nuts
trying
to
seek
it
out
but
the
bang
for
your
buck
is
high
on
this
one
had
this
on
tap
at
poor
phils
in
oak
park
il
golden
color
with
foamy
head
with
good
lacing
the
smell
is
floral
hop
with
citrus
notes
you
think
from
the
smell
that
it
is
going
to
be
a
hop
bitter
blast
which
i
dont
really
care
for
but
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
with
sweet
malt
husk
and
yeast
flavors
very
well
crafted
recipe
extremely
drinkable
definitely
not
a
hoptea
that
totally
covers
up
the
rest
of
the
ingredients
this
one
exemplifies
what
an
american
ipa
can
be
very
huge
smell
of
juicy
fruits
maybe
some
berry
smell
in
there
too
and
then
some
sweetness
what
an
excellent
aroma
this
is
definitely
what
i
expect
from
lagunitas
it
still
has
that
juicy
fruity
hop
taste
with
a
spicy
hop
kick
in
the
beginning
and
a
good
almost
piney
bitter
finish
at
the
end
you
get
a
huge
sweetness
in
the
middle
that
blends
real
well
with
the
tremendous
hop
flavor
and
then
the
wheat
finishing
in
the
back
with
the
hop
bitterness
the
hop
profile
is
very
close
to
their
other
beers
like
their
regular
ipa
maximus
and
hop
stoopid
although
they
are
all
very
similar
i
still
like
this
beer
just
as
much
as
them
even
though
the
hops
shine
the
most
in
this
beer
that
wheat
malt
really
completes
it
and
gives
lagunitas
regular
hopped
up
beers
a
good
twist
definitely
recommend
this
beer
its
like
a
wheat
ipa
d
i
could
probably
drink
this
stuff
from
sunup
to
sundown
lagunitas
makes
some
damn
fine
products
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
good
just
not
sure
if
this
is
fresh
or
not
ill
have
to
pick
some
up
again
to
be
sure
mediumbodied
and
carbonation
all
in
all
the
american
pale
wheat
ale
category
is
one
style
that
i
am
not
particularly
fond
of
but
this
is
definitely
drinkable
a
little
high
on
the
abv
to
be
terribly
sessionable
but
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
good
beer
and
a
great
take
on
the
style
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
beer
to
keep
around
tried
this
beer
for
the
first
time
tonight
after
seeing
it
at
the
beer
store
a
few
times
i
really
enjoyed
it
nice
orange
color
with
some
good
head
on
it
good
hop
aroma
and
an
even
better
taste
this
is
a
really
good
ale
with
a
good
bitter
finish
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
this
beer
again
overall
another
delicious
brew
from
this
nice
wc
brewery
i
seem
to
like
every
thing
they
put
in
those
funny
stubby
bottles
keep
sending
them
east
d
the
is
a
little
strong
on
the
floral
notes
but
delicious
nonetheless
good
stuff
an
interesting
beer
i
still
prefer
the
lagunitas
ipa
it
has
a
far
superior
hop
flavor
and
a
low
enough
abv
to
drink
the
heck
out
of
them
this
one
is
good
but
why
so
high
in
alcohol
for
a
beer
that
is
so
light
and
that
drinks
so
quickly
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
2
finger
white
head
prett
agressive
pour
on
the
smell
i
get
a
ton
of
pineapple
on
the
second
pass
i
picked
up
a
good
amount
of
orange
mango
juice
very
interesting
and
complex
smell
taste
is
full
of
floral
hops
good
mouthfeel
and
ok
drinkability
i
like
this
brew
but
too
sweet
to
throw
back
more
than
one
or
two
nonetheless
i
hope
this
review
helps
somewhat
this
is
a
great
beer
and
very
affordable
mbeautifuly
cleard
and
crisp
freshness
with
a
lot
of
carbination
make
this
a
nice
feeling
beer
along
with
its
nearly
perfect
tatse
for
anyone
whos
loves
hoppy
beers
so
much
flavor
and
charictor
packed
in
this
beer
one
of
my
top
ten
beers
at
7
5
a
few
of
these
is
just
plenty
but
i
could
drink
nothing
but
these
all
night
when
i
am
in
a
hoppy
mood
truly
awesome
mouthfeel
is
light
with
active
carbonation
this
is
a
well
balanced
very
drinkable
double
ipa
certainly
one
to
come
back
to
again
and
again
d
so
drinkable
so
clean
so
light
nothing
lingers
the
flavors
are
vibrant
and
juicy
this
is
a
joy
to
drink
the
liquid
was
a
pale
golden
amber
color
with
a
bubbly
whit
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
i
took
a
sniff
and
first
could
smell
grapefruit
then
pineapple
and
sugary
sweet
malt
when
you
take
a
sip
there
is
an
orangey
citrus
bite
that
soon
gets
dominated
by
a
sweetness
there
are
some
background
flavors
of
grapefruit
and
pine
the
beer
is
kind
of
thick
it
has
low
carbonation
and
is
warming
from
the
alcohol
this
is
a
wellrounded
beer
i
would
drink
it
anytime
the
little
sumpin
this
beer
gives
is
a
lot
and
it
is
only
one
of
many
great
beers
from
lagunitas
dvery
drinkable
wish
i
had
anoher
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
fairly
pale
straw
to
golden
yellow
little
head
that
disappeared
quickly
smell
here
is
great
hops
right
there
in
your
face
with
pine
and
pineappley
citrus
taste
has
a
nice
bitter
kick
with
a
slightly
sweeter
finish
with
bread
and
wheat
notes
slight
peppery
bite
as
well
has
a
slightly
heavier
body
than
i
expected
from
based
on
its
color
and
pour
but
fits
right
in
with
the
flavor
profile
nice
and
refreshing
beer
leaves
just
enough
hoppy
bite
to
make
you
want
another
sip
and
goes
down
very
smooth
by
the
end
of
the
glass
the
alcohol
comes
out
just
a
tad
first
beer
by
lagunitas
and
i
definitely
want
to
check
out
some
more
with
all
the
citrus
this
would
be
a
fantastic
thirst
qeuncher
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
i
would
have
never
known
this
was
an
american
pale
until
today
i
had
yet
to
be
blown
away
by
a
lagunitas
beer
everything
has
changed
as
of
this
moment
this
beer
is
remarkable
i
will
be
drinking
this
and
maybe
only
this
until
next
fall
d
very
well
balanced
not
too
hoppynot
too
sweet
easy
to
drink
and
would
appeal
to
many
different
people
def
would
have
another
i
will
be
honest
here
did
not
even
realize
this
beer
was
a
wheat
ale
until
i
found
it
on
here
pleasantly
surprised
good
beer
i
would
happily
have
this
as
a
staple
in
my
fridge
this
is
a
new
beer
to
me
that
i
really
find
very
drinkable
may
become
a
new
favorite
very
sessionable
beer
i
will
definitely
pick
some
of
this
up
in
the
spring
and
summer
this
is
a
very
very
easy
drinker
if
youre
into
hop
flavors
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
sip
outside
on
a
summer
day
its
relatively
light
and
a
great
showcase
of
mild
hop
flavors
d
good
drinkability
would
be
great
in
the
summer
or
with
a
meal
really
impressed
with
this
one
dvery
drinkable
a
good
beer
to
share
with
friends
or
keep
all
to
yourself
a
good
solid
wheat
beer
with
a
fantastic
hop
character
about
itself
great
one
from
lagunitas
ill
be
adding
this
to
my
keep
in
stock
list
for
the
fridge
pours
a
bright
golden
yellow
color
w
a
thin
white
head
looking
forward
to
this
one
after
reading
some
very
positive
reviews
smell
is
very
crisp
and
citrus
based
and
the
hops
are
there
as
well
wow
this
beer
is
an
animal
a
hop
crazed
crisp
lemony
animal
that
shocks
my
palate
very
smooth
though
especially
the
finish
and
aftertaste
this
beer
makes
me
feel
alive
alive
w
hops
i
also
dont
really
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
at
7
5
its
not
a
huge
abv
but
impressive
that
i
dont
detect
anything
very
stealthy
the
drinkability
is
great
i
could
put
down
several
of
these
pretty
easily
and
not
think
twice
about
it
i
really
like
this
beer
and
will
be
buying
it
again
for
sure
another
fantastic
effort
by
lagunitas
cheers
d
at
7
5
abv
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
the
light
color
and
crisp
taste
really
throw
me
off
i
feel
as
though
im
drinking
a
normal
lower
pale
ale
until
i
look
at
the
bottle
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
and
be
more
intodxicated
than
i
would
want
to
be
due
to
the
high
abv
it
would
be
a
good
finisher
for
a
hefeweizen
tasting
session
very
interesting
beer
the
mouthfeel
during
the
finish
is
unlike
any
ive
felt
very
nice
array
of
flavors
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
worth
trying
for
starters
i
prefer
this
to
a
little
sumpin
wild
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
belgium
styles
and
i
thought
this
was
more
mild
and
drinkable
it
pours
orangeyellow
with
big
foamy
head
the
smell
and
taste
is
sweet
and
floral
with
some
sourness
to
follow
it
has
a
nice
medium
body
that
is
crisp
i
prefer
the
orangehoppy
bite
in
this
brew
to
the
thick
sweetness
in
the
wild
it
has
a
wheatiness
almost
making
it
a
hybrid
of
sorts
i
had
a
few
of
these
overall
this
is
a
great
offering
from
lagunitas
it
is
balanced
and
delicious
and
has
a
nice
little
kick
to
boot
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
must
try
in
the
summer
if
other
american
pale
wheat
ales
are
lawnmower
beers
then
this
is
a
tractor
beer
good
stuff
o
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
it
has
so
much
good
stuff
going
on
a
favorite
for
spring
and
summer
overall
a
bit
too
grassy
and
feel
that
the
the
dry
hops
missed
their
peak
i
bet
this
beer
would
be
much
better
on
tap
when
very
fresh
this
one
is
super
smooth
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
dangerously
easy
to
put
down
at
7
drinkability
would
be
higher
if
the
flavor
could
match
the
incredible
nose
on
this
thing
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
the
alcohol
is
not
really
detectable
a
solid
brew
indeed
i
went
out
on
a
whim
buying
this
ale
i
had
never
heard
of
it
but
am
very
impressed
drinking
from
bottle
is
nice
it
might
be
better
from
a
glass
though
d
on
a
hot
day
i
could
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
six
pack
of
this
and
not
even
thinking
twice
about
it
being
over
7
its
crisp
and
refreshing
with
enough
hop
presence
to
take
in
before
each
gulp
this
beer
poured
a
clear
amber
color
and
formed
a
snow
white
foamy
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
pepper
and
caramel
the
flavor
was
of
malt
caramel
and
pepper
the
body
was
medium
light
and
the
finish
slightly
smokey
its
a
great
food
beer
good
with
sturdy
salads
and
light
to
moderately
flavoured
dishes
id
pick
it
as
a
good
introduction
to
food
pairing
with
lightly
spiced
meats
and
cheeses
theres
little
to
fault
its
a
superbly
balanced
pale
wheat
brew
that
continually
surprises
for
some
reason
i
thought
this
would
have
more
a
bright
hop
presence
does
a
good
a
job
at
still
drinking
like
a
wheat
ale
though
a
very
hoppy
one
improved
as
it
warmed
too
d
very
drinkable
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
d
pretty
interesting
full
hopped
american
wheat
is
a
nice
mild
ipa
with
a
clean
sweetness
very
easy
to
drink
so
enjoyable
and
so
drinkable
try
it
youll
like
it
the
color
when
poured
was
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
amount
of
foam
that
disapated
almost
immediately
the
smell
of
piney
hops
was
evident
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
of
bitter
hops
citrus
lemon
orange
rind
with
a
hint
of
yeast
was
also
evident
in
the
flavor
the
bittness
was
not
overpowering
but
could
of
been
a
little
more
sutle
this
american
pale
whea
ale
was
more
like
an
ipa
rather
than
the
wheat
ale
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
hoppier
than
average
wheat
beer
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
taste
follows
the
smell
but
shows
a
bit
more
of
the
light
malt
base
sugar
cookie
malts
but
very
lightly
great
canvas
for
the
hop
character
light
medium
bodied
with
nice
prickly
carbonation
works
well
extremely
drinkable
and
doesnt
even
show
a
hint
if
the
abv
d
standard
lagunitas
fare
fairly
good
but
nothing
spectacular
drinkability
the
nice
crisp
profile
of
the
wheat
with
an
american
ale
style
yeast
and
hops
make
this
guy
a
winner
the
body
is
around
medium
with
a
slick
feel
and
very
sharp
carbonation
the
tingle
lasts
long
through
the
dry
finish
boy
i
think
i
found
a
refreshing
summer
drinker
that
has
a
load
of
hops
even
im
impressed
bravo
lagunitas
for
filling
a
gap
for
the
greengeeks
out
there
this
beer
is
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
different
d
was
surprised
how
good
this
beer
was
very
easy
drinking
and
dangerously
addictive
hop
heads
beer
for
sure
do
if
youre
a
hop
fan
this
one
is
for
the
long
haul
its
by
no
means
overbearing
but
its
certainly
not
a
character
to
go
unnoticed
d
borderline
ipaapa
but
enjoyable
nevertheless
this
one
is
light
enough
and
crisp
enough
to
be
highly
drinkable
an
ipa
crossed
with
a
wheat
beer
then
pumped
up
to
close
to
dipa
regions
works
when
the
brewery
is
lagunitas
hoppy
citrusy
and
crisp
the
beer
is
at
times
light
like
a
wheat
beer
then
big
hops
like
an
ipa
very
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
excellent
beer
that
is
luckily
available
in
bc
hoppy
wheat
is
what
the
beer
geeks
are
callin
for
this
beer
has
a
thick
wheatinduced
head
and
clear
pale
amber
color
it
has
some
sweet
breadiness
underneath
a
big
tide
of
hop
aroma
its
super
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
thick
flavor
of
soft
floral
and
fruity
hops
and
the
bitterness
is
there
but
nothing
too
sharpmore
like
dried
grass
or
tobacco
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
snappy
dry
malt
character
and
is
faintly
yeasty
with
some
warming
esters
the
hops
stay
on
the
palate
far
into
the
aftertaste
this
one
has
it
all
figured
outan
amazing
ale
im
drinking
this
really
quickly
as
its
an
amazing
surprise
and
there
is
not
a
trace
of
the
alcohol
if
you
want
a
hop
smack
this
will
do
you
as
well
as
stone
ipa
or
even
blind
pig
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
with
a
thin
foamy
white
head
nose
is
dominated
by
grapefruit
hops
citrus
and
flowery
auroma
good
notes
of
caramel
malts
taste
is
a
chewy
bready
malt
upfront
some
woodygrassy
characteristics
too
sharp
bitterness
towards
the
finish
which
is
dry
in
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
medium
bodied
easy
drinker
here
my
only
regret
is
not
getting
a
six
pack
d
definitely
a
nice
wheat
beer
id
pick
it
up
again
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
somewhere
they
call
this
a
wheat
beer
i
call
this
a
damned
good
ipa
overall
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
a
7
5er
cheers
d
almost
no
booze
in
the
profile
for
the
7
ab
holds
a
great
hop
character
that
isnt
clawing
and
doesnt
leave
a
sharp
bitterness
or
dryness
in
on
your
palate
the
flavors
are
fantastic
and
the
carbonation
is
restrained
but
refreshing
a
fantastic
american
session
beer
hard
to
believe
this
is
considered
a
wheat
ale
a
type
i
usually
avoid
fortunately
i
did
not
know
before
buying
a
6pack
i
picked
it
because
the
label
said
ibu
74
2
and
indeed
it
is
more
like
ipa
than
wheat
beer
better
than
regular
lagunitas
ipa
not
as
good
as
their
maximus
ipa
the
label
is
kind
of
stupid
like
st
pauli
girl
so
i
turned
the
bottles
around
in
our
refrigerator
so
my
wife
couldnt
see
them
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
has
a
yellow
colour
and
a
good
head
that
lasts
it
has
a
nice
hoppy
smell
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
citrus
bitterness
its
nice
and
foamy
in
the
mouth
and
very
drinakable
its
delicious
d
probably
the
most
hopped
out
pale
wheat
ive
ever
had
and
decidedly
american
west
coast
hopforward
as
expected
of
lagunitas
the
7
5
abv
carries
a
nice
warming
sensation
but
isnt
really
translated
in
a
lot
of
alcoholic
heat
in
the
flavor
not
to
be
pounded
in
the
summer
heat
rather
reserved
for
the
ipa
fan
who
wants
a
wheat
ale
d
the
drinkability
is
good
i
think
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
it
is
really
refreshing
and
the
taste
leaves
you
wanting
more
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
a
6pack
of
this
drinkability
starts
out
fairly
lite
and
refreshing
and
finishes
with
some
hop
bitterness
i
must
say
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
a
hoppy
wheat
beer
but
i
like
it
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
and
one
i
enjoy
regularly
im
really
starting
to
get
a
lot
of
respect
for
this
brewery
and
am
sorry
that
its
taken
me
this
long
to
get
around
to
trying
this
and
some
of
their
other
terrific
offerings
the
little
sumpin
opens
with
a
thick
glob
of
a
head
atop
a
light
golden
body
within
which
rise
a
sporadic
school
of
carbonation
bubbles
layguneetus
upon
raising
your
glass
for
the
initial
sip
the
nose
is
immediately
overwhelmed
by
a
hearty
aroma
of
grapefruit
this
grapefruit
theme
continues
on
to
the
palate
however
there
is
perceptible
malt
finish
here
as
for
the
mouthfeel
it
is
moderately
chewy
without
any
identification
to
discern
it
to
be
a
wheat
ale
in
fact
one
could
mistake
it
for
an
ipa
albeit
one
with
a
lighter
body
lagoonitis
drinkability
may
be
easy
to
drink
for
some
but
others
could
only
drink
one
of
these
and
have
to
switch
to
something
lightersweeter
i
enjoyed
4
out
of
the
6pack
and
let
my
girlfriends
dad
have
the
other
two
paid
8
99
for
a
growler
at
the
local
beer
store
and
as
usual
any
lagunitas
is
a
good
call
will
drink
this
again
preferably
in
the
summer
d
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
because
the
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
had
ontap
at
apex
in
portland
out
of
a
standard
pint
glass
it
is
a
transparent
golden
orange
color
with
visible
carbonation
and
a
one
finger
white
head
smell
is
very
hoppy
with
floral
and
grapefruit
notes
as
far
as
smell
goes
it
doesnt
share
many
attributes
with
a
standard
wheat
ale
it
smells
more
like
an
apa
or
an
ipa
the
taste
has
a
little
more
wheat
in
it
but
the
emphasis
is
still
on
the
hops
not
the
wheat
mouthfeel
is
good
very
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
this
beer
is
similar
to
gumballhead
but
i
think
i
like
gumballhead
better
i
am
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
being
a
wheat
beer
as
there
isnt
a
lot
of
wheat
in
the
taste
if
you
want
a
wheat
beer
then
go
for
an
american
knock
off
of
a
hefeweizen
but
if
you
are
looking
for
an
apa
or
ipa
that
has
a
touch
of
wheat
in
it
then
this
is
what
you
are
looking
for
d
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
may
be
considered
a
summer
beer
but
due
to
its
spicy
nature
it
works
for
the
winter
also
real
beer
lovers
use
hops
as
mistle
toe
anyway
delicious
d
pleasing
brew
and
def
worth
the
buy
some
beers
are
flavourful
enough
to
sip
contemplatively
over
the
course
of
an
entire
evening
others
are
delicious
enough
to
want
to
chug
in
one
giant
gulp
as
lagunitas
says
life
is
uncertain
dont
sip
guys
trust
me
you
dont
have
to
tell
me
twice
with
a
beer
like
this
thats
all
too
easy
to
do
hell
this
bottles
been
done
for
a
while
now
do
wow
for
a
7
5abv
beer
one
could
almost
make
this
a
6
pack
night
wrecked
palate
and
all
alcohol
presence
is
virtually
nonrecognizable
damn
tasty
wow
didnt
think
id
like
anything
in
this
style
more
than
gumballhead
but
alas
here
it
is
taste
is
very
hopforward
more
citrus
hops
tropical
notes
finishes
with
an
aspirin
like
astringency
very
crisp
and
refreshing
you
just
want
to
keep
going
for
more
and
more
but
have
to
calm
yourself
due
to
the
7
5
abv
phenomenal
beer
d
i
am
definitely
going
to
make
this
a
regular
d
delicious
just
a
good
beer
overall
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
gave
me
the
illusion
of
being
really
drinkable
until
i
had
four
of
them
i
made
the
mistake
of
checking
the
abv
afterwards
fun
night
for
a
wheat
ale
it
has
a
little
too
bitter
aftertaste
but
since
im
a
hop
lover
i
approve
easy
to
enjoy
and
fairly
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
density
with
adequate
carbonation
this
was
a
unique
american
wheatipa
hybrid
firstly
im
stoked
to
be
able
drink
this
big
cheers
to
adam
to
making
it
happenit
pours
a
nice
vibrant
orange
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
of
smog
across
the
top
and
average
lacingthe
smell
is
distinctly
pine
needle
hopsbubblegum
and
sweet
golden
wheatit
has
a
nice
medium
bodied
lively
carbonated
mouthfeel
which
feels
really
refreshing
and
has
tastes
of
orange
zestpiney
hops
and
finishes
with
a
lemonlime
golden
wheat
hit
which
is
quite
dry
and
makes
you
want
another
sip
straight
awayoverall
i
cannot
really
say
anything
bad
about
this
brew
apart
from
the
fact
its
not
a
regular
on
our
shores
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
of
their
lineup
ive
got
waiting
nice
color
on
this
beer
orange
golden
color
disappointing
otherwise
not
much
head
at
all
very
spotty
if
any
lacing
aroma
is
citrusy
lemon
and
grassy
vegatile
notes
also
very
light
aroma
of
grapefruit
taste
is
pretty
fruity
with
some
sweetness
bitterness
from
the
hops
not
all
too
complex
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
beer
drinks
well
it
tastes
sessionable
overall
i
liked
this
beer
more
when
i
first
tried
it
on
tap
perhaps
just
an
older
bottle
wow
i
could
drink
this
all
day
easy
to
see
why
sumpin
is
ranked
as
the
2
apwa
as
this
compares
quite
favourably
to
gumballhead
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
toprated
beers
d
a
nice
brew
i
dont
think
i
would
classify
it
as
a
pale
wheat
ale
seems
more
like
a
pale
ale
to
ipa
id
drink
another
not
only
is
the
drinkability
right
there
with
any
session
beer
but
this
is
one
dangerous
brew
careful
when
drinking
because
with
its
7
5
abv
itll
certainly
knock
you
down
seemingly
yet
another
variation
of
their
ipa
still
a
good
beer
you
cant
go
wrong
with
drinkability
overhopped
for
the
style
by
a
lot
i
get
the
feeling
that
thats
why
its
ranked
so
much
higher
than
the
majority
of
pale
wheat
ales
lame
this
is
a
good
beer
but
its
not
true
to
the
style
drinks
like
an
ipa
who
doesnt
love
gettin
themselves
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
eh
this
potential
entendre
pours
a
cloudy
straw
topped
by
two
fingers
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
grapefruit
melon
light
onion
flowers
and
light
caramel
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
light
clove
pepper
nutmeg
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
body
is
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
bit
o
brew
something
that
im
upset
i
took
so
long
to
try
mouthfeeldrinkabilitynotes
i
probably
wouldnt
have
guessed
that
this
was
a
wheat
ale
if
it
didnt
say
so
on
the
bottle
but
theres
something
about
added
wheat
that
always
lightens
things
up
7
5
is
a
fairly
high
abv
for
a
wheat
but
it
doesnt
make
this
any
harder
to
throw
back
not
to
mention
everything
is
completely
balanced
quite
refreshing
i
was
surprised
how
much
i
liked
this
given
its
not
my
goto
style
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
decent
lacing
from
the
frothy
white
foam
head
the
smell
is
of
lots
of
hops
particularly
the
pine
and
lemon
aroma
derived
from
the
hops
used
the
taste
is
honestly
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
i
had
expected
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
a
good
surprise
theres
not
a
hell
of
a
lot
to
the
taste
but
the
main
components
are
citrus
lemony
and
hints
of
banana
it
feels
really
nice
on
the
tongue
and
is
one
of
the
better
drinking
beers
i
know
i
love
love
love
this
beer
i
wrote
lagunitas
a
few
months
ago
begging
them
to
keep
this
a
yearround
brew
and
a
few
months
later
they
announced
that
it
would
indeed
be
year
round
this
says
something
about
it
a
hoppy
complex
brew
thats
incredibly
drinkable
and
hides
its
abv
dangerously
well
whats
not
to
love
growler
fill
from
tap
at
bierkraft
poured
into
shaker
super
aroma
of
hops
and
citrus
when
poured
very
bubbly
large
white
head
head
glued
it
self
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
is
long
lasting
ive
just
poured
my
third
glass
and
this
is
quite
drinkable
each
pour
the
head
gets
larger
and
more
sticky
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
smooth
mouthfeel
light
and
bitter
on
the
tongue
taste
great
nice
smooth
drinkable
and
wheat
pale
ale
mostly
pale
ale
with
some
wheat
tastes
heavy
of
grapefruit
but
not
all
bitter
rind
it
has
a
nice
full
flavor
of
the
flesh
of
the
fruit
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
more
hoppy
than
others
ive
had
mouthfeel
was
pretty
big
because
of
all
the
hops
so
you
probably
would
want
to
drink
more
that
one
or
two
d
alcohol
is
well
hidden
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
along
with
a
good
mix
of
hop
flavors
at
first
i
wasnt
entirely
convinced
but
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
i
liked
it
an
outstanding
offering
by
lagunitas
the
7
5
will
sneak
up
on
you
i
think
because
you
dont
taste
it
does
lagunitas
make
a
bad
beer
ive
never
tried
one
at
least
some
may
argue
that
their
hop
profile
is
onesided
i
cant
necessarily
disagree
but
i
love
it
nonetheless
grab
one
if
you
see
it
if
you
like
it
seek
out
its
counterpart
lil
sumpin
wild
westmalle
yeast
and
some
extra
strength
make
for
another
great
take
on
this
american
wheatipawhatever
the
hell
this
tasty
thing
is
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
im
glad
i
didnt
eventually
because
this
is
a
really
tasty
brew
and
an
exceptionally
drinkable
one
the
characters
are
unusual
but
balance
against
each
other
well
i
love
slightly
offkilter
beers
that
still
work
so
well
this
is
a
good
example
of
one
clear
golden
bodied
brew
small
but
sturdy
foamy
white
head
leaves
its
mark
on
the
glass
big
hop
scent
for
a
wheat
definitely
not
run
of
the
mill
for
a
wheat
citrus
hops
grapefruit
nice
wheat
undertones
but
its
dominated
by
the
hops
alcohol
spiciness
is
a
bit
more
noticeable
due
to
the
wheat
character
i
think
thin
to
med
bodied
very
interesting
and
pretty
damn
good
tasting
too
try
it
bottle
poured
a
lightly
hazy
dirty
amber
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
west
coast
hops
is
noticeable
though
not
too
powerful
taste
is
also
a
good
mix
between
some
citrusy
hops
with
a
nice
bitter
presence
and
a
good
malt
backbone
though
wheat
is
hardly
noticeable
another
easily
drinkable
beer
from
lagunitas
with
not
too
much
complexity
d
drinks
closer
to
a
big
pale
or
an
ipa
the
wheat
is
not
as
noticeable
as
it
is
with
other
beers
in
this
style
d
decent
thought
it
would
be
maltier
if
there
was
more
elements
of
a
pale
wheat
it
would
be
better
d
rich
enough
for
colder
weather
cheeky
enough
for
warm
good
stuff
d
definitely
bitter
and
chock
full
of
hops
but
it
doesnt
leave
your
throat
with
that
dry
barren
patch
that
you
get
some
high
ibu
high
abv
pale
ales
i
love
that
patch
but
it
leaves
me
desiring
a
glass
of
water
this
beer
counters
the
bitterness
with
a
subdued
sweetness
that
is
at
the
same
time
refreshing
and
complex
ah
this
beer
is
greatyou
know
with
lagunitas
its
always
very
good
or
pretty
goodalways
been
satisfied
with
their
beeri
think
the
westmalle
yeast
strain
did
this
beer
very
welli
can
actually
relate
this
beer
to
westmalleleft
this
beer
pretty
dryit
smells
like
dark
fruit
and
def
hopsa
little
alcohol
in
the
nose
as
welldarn
fine
beer
could
drink
more
but
id
be
much
more
likely
to
seek
out
a
multitude
of
west
coast
ipas
at
around
the
same
abv
md
medium
bodied
extremely
drinkable
leaves
a
very
nice
finish
the
7
5
is
hidden
extremely
well
surprised
me
that
this
beer
is
classified
as
a
pale
wheat
but
i
will
take
it
a
great
beer
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
is
an
excellent
release
from
lagunitas
i
dont
really
see
smell
or
taste
any
evidence
that
this
is
an
american
pale
wheat
but
it
must
be
for
what
its
worth
its
among
the
best
in
the
style
if
thats
true
the
hop
presence
alone
carries
it
to
the
top
if
you
havent
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
fine
release
from
lagunitas
do
yourself
a
favor
and
find
a
6pack
or
more
if
possible
american
pale
wheat
ale
my
sort
of
pale
canadian
ass
i
know
that
this
is
made
with
wheat
malt
then
ok
but
the
rest
of
the
story
screams
out
tasty
wc
ipa
despite
the
wheatiness
and
im
not
going
to
fault
a
damned
agreeable
beer
for
being
cast
in
the
wrong
category
because
of
the
black
sheep
in
its
makeup
drinkability
my
days
of
big
hop
are
long
in
the
past
but
this
works
and
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
the
hops
are
certainly
present
but
are
well
balanced
by
the
malt
if
not
sessionable
still
very
drinkable
my
soninlaw
whos
a
miller
lite
type
of
beer
drinker
really
liked
this
beer
i
was
going
to
hide
the
6pack
from
him
but
in
an
effort
to
further
his
beer
education
i
gave
him
four
of
the
six
bottles
overall
an
amazing
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
been
disappointed
with
most
apwas
so
almost
didnt
grab
it
but
read
some
good
things
on
it
so
did
so
glad
i
did
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
need
to
go
get
a
6xer
before
they
are
gone
highly
recommend
avail
here
in
tx
rotation
seasonal
release
during
the
season
it
will
make
the
heavy
rotation
for
sure
hy
pours
a
pale
orange
with
modest
white
head
aromas
of
grapefruit
honey
flowers
and
peaches
lightly
sweet
subdued
malt
backbone
with
medium
tart
strong
citrus
middle
and
lightly
bitter
grassy
hops
medium
body
with
average
carbonation
and
slightly
chewy
texture
juicy
and
citrusy
with
a
great
complex
fresh
hop
finish
whether
its
a
wheat
ale
or
ipa
i
did
it
taste
is
spiceypeppery
leaf
grapefruit
and
guava
it
has
light
dominant
bitterness
with
faint
underlying
caramellyraisinyfruity
grain
sweetness
what
character
it
has
soon
blurs
and
degrades
to
be
less
distinguishable
character
overall
and
rather
onedimensional
it
has
some
basic
decent
character
but
not
much
feel
at
least
is
good
full
a
bit
creamy
pepperycitrusy
bitterness
is
a
bit
to
sharp
and
strong
at
the
finish
and
lingers
drinkability
is
decent
but
it
is
very
tiresome
at
least
it
tastes
a
little
different
from
the
90
of
lagunitas
beers
that
all
taste
like
variations
of
the
same
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
really
nice
mix
of
hops
and
malt
i
loved
it
gunna
have
to
drink
more
of
this
next
summer
cheers
to
lagunitas
but
it
us
a
good
pale
ale
filled
with
american
hops
the
classic
flavors
and
aromas
of
citrus
the
beer
was
served
very
cold
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
fine
mouthfeel
and
tasted
fresh
and
clean
good
drinkability
for
those
who
like
the
hops
nice
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
to
take
time
to
have
one
or
two
mixed
in
when
your
thirsty
for
a
few
not
one
for
those
who
prefer
a
mild
domestic
brew
this
is
my
1st
updated
review
of
this
brew
i
put
it
as
my
second
favorite
behind
pliney
d
from
the
first
sip
this
beer
shouts
lagunitas
with
its
recognizable
combination
of
floral
and
citrus
aromatic
qualitiesthe
ipa
is
definitely
there
as
in
sumpin
extra
even
hop
stoopid
may
be
eligible
for
first
cousinstatus
despite
the
evident
resemblance
to
other
family
members
this
beer
should
not
be
known
by
association
alone
from
a
stylistic
standpoint
it
is
miles
from
the
middle
with
all
the
qualities
of
a
strong
ipanot
exactly
what
one
might
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
d
awesome
i
picked
up
a
case
of
this
without
tasting
it
and
dont
regret
it
for
a
second
this
beer
definately
lived
up
to
all
the
hype
very
drinkable
lil
sumpin
sumpin
is
just
a
damn
good
beer
great
balance
between
fruitiness
bitterness
and
sweetness
very
easy
to
enjoy
a
few
in
a
sitting
pours
golden
with
decent
white
head
good
penetration
of
color
and
overall
handsome
beer
aromas
of
mixed
citrus
with
light
herbal
qualities
are
noted
on
the
palate
the
herbalcitrus
comes
through
nicely
with
some
soft
wheaty
cracker
in
the
background
finishes
with
some
of
the
herbal
elements
that
linger
for
a
bit
on
the
palate
moderate
carbonation
and
a
resinous
creamy
mouthfeel
grapefruit
and
tangerine
up
front
followed
by
some
biscuit
and
caramel
sweetness
gentle
pine
bitterness
on
the
finish
gains
intensity
as
the
beer
warms
wellbalanced
and
very
drinkable
higher
alcohol
is
almost
undetectable
d
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
a
nice
refreshing
hoppy
brew
that
is
highly
drinkable
recommended
really
good
beer
overall
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
lagunitas
in
my
opinion
i
remember
liking
it
a
bit
more
ontap
but
its
well
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
of
bottles
outstanding
very
hoppy
american
pale
wheat
i
loved
gumballhead
but
it
isnt
available
in
mi
this
is
just
even
better
outstanding
this
is
a
wheat
beer
i
honestly
couldnt
tell
when
this
one
was
going
down
my
impression
was
that
it
was
another
hoppy
ipaish
brew
also
called
strong
from
what
ive
seen
on
tap
at
founding
farmers
in
dc
most
noticeable
factors
in
this
light
yellow
beer
were
its
huge
fruitiness
which
is
mainly
pineapple
and
citrus
these
help
bring
some
sweetness
to
the
fairly
strong
hop
presence
a
light
beer
light
body
pretty
high
in
carbonation
overall
a
respectable
beer
but
not
standard
for
the
style
in
the
least
solid
d
highly
enjoyable
and
worthy
of
purchasing
a
case
once
a
year
d
this
was
delicious
with
an
offering
of
hops
that
slightly
overpowered
the
malts
but
was
nicely
balanced
the
flavours
were
fruity
and
provided
for
a
very
pleasureable
experience
highly
recommended
to
anoyone
who
likes
hops
but
doesnt
want
something
that
will
overpower
the
tastebuds
despite
being
7
5
abv
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
multiple
bottles
quite
drinkable
at
7
5
abv
just
finishes
clean
making
you
want
to
try
another
d
a
very
tasty
brew
for
those
of
us
who
like
the
bitter
life
drinkability
another
great
deal
from
lagunitas
probably
the
best
value
brewery
in
the
us
have
had
this
on
draft
and
out
of
the
bottle
and
i
think
this
might
be
my
favorite
summer
seasonal
beer
d
a
really
great
beer
that
i
could
drink
alot
of
the
alcohol
will
get
you
as
it
is
almost
unnoticable
this
is
now
my
favorite
summer
seasonal
and
one
of
my
go
to
hoppy
beers
now
on
to
the
beer
store
for
my
next
lagunitas
d
this
was
recently
one
of
the
first
clone
type
recipes
i
brewed
love
the
style
for
its
hop
assertiveness
yet
ease
of
drink
hides
a
7
5abv
very
dangerously
give
me
more
repost
almost
3
years
later
now
my
oh
my
how
the
palate
changes
or
maybe
the
recipe
i
dont
know
how
i
could
have
disliked
this
beer
it
is
now
my
fallback
summer
beer
very
tasty
and
overhopped
for
the
style
whatever
the
hell
that
means
lol
anyway
love
this
stuff
d
a
very
tasty
beer
indeed
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
thin
head
of
small
soaplike
creamcolored
bubbles
the
aroma
is
clean
but
fruity
with
big
citrus
notes
of
lemon
and
orange
the
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
with
a
big
citrus
hop
character
up
front
with
some
pine
and
a
bit
of
an
earthy
undercurrent
this
one
may
be
an
even
more
hoppedup
pale
wheat
than
i
remember
3
floyds
gumballhead
being
the
texture
is
quite
dry
and
the
prickly
carbonation
doesnt
add
constructively
overall
its
an
overhopped
light
wheat
ale
that
still
doesnt
compare
to
a
strong
pale
ale
but
also
loses
the
qualities
of
the
wheat
nice
and
drinkable
but
not
special
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
full
of
hops
wonderful
citrus
and
pine
aromas
wafting
off
this
beer
very
one
dimensional
in
aroma
and
flavor
all
hops
as
the
malt
did
not
stand
a
chance
against
the
hops
the
featured
hops
give
a
powerful
citrus
blast
to
the
tastebuds
a
larger
body
than
most
in
the
style
good
carbonation
without
being
harsh
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
is
a
hoppier
more
bitter
and
brasher
gumballhead
but
it
is
not
as
drinkable
or
enjoyable
because
of
this
a
good
hop

a
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
quite
drinkable
this
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
last
years
batch
which
is
unfortunate
as
that
was
delicious
still
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
quenches
ones
thirst
on
a
warm
summers
day
quite
readily
another
great
offering
from
lagunitas
as
stated
abit
too
sweet
but
a
nice
hoppy
wheat
ale
i
havent
had
all
that
many
pale
wheat
ales
but
little
sumpin
sumpin
is
the
clear
champ
among
those
ive
sampled
if
i
had
to
describe
this
to
someone
in
a
bar
in
one
sentence
itd
be
a
bit
like
an
ipa
though
a
bit
more
sessionable
seek
this
one
out
certainly
this
is
interesting
and
worthwhile
to
try
i
have
the
rest
of
a
sixer
and
the
rest
of
the
weekend
so
i
hope
this
grows
on
me
but
right
now
im
a
bit
underwhelmed
did
i
speak
too
soon
about
lag
overall
i
have
heard
this
described
as
an
amped
up
gumballhead
they
are
both
hoppy
wheat
beers
but
i
think
the
comparison
really
ends
there
this
is
good
but
not
great
a
very
cool
and
innovative
mixture
of
pale
ale
and
wheat
love
it
rich
golden
color
with
a
slight
head
it
has
a
subtle
but
sweet
banana
and
peach
flavor
balanced
out
with
a
citrus
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
well
balanced
and
refreshing
it
wouldnt
be
something
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
winter
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
mild
fall
afternoon
would
be
easily
enjoyed
one
after
the
another
after
another
d
quite
a
take
on
a
wheat
ale
and
really
a
phenomenal
idea
douse
a
wheat
ale
with
hops
and
see
what
happens
what
happens
is
yumminess
notes
the
beer
is
very
unique
and
really
makes
me
say
there
really
is
a
little
something
in
there
that
makes
you
think
and
question
your
taste
buds
its
a
little
off
but
everything
just
works
leans
towards
an
ipa
overall
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
and
am
sad
that
it
is
a
limited
release
from
a
brewery
lagunitas
that
is
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
you
cant
call
this
beer
an
outright
hopbomb
you
cant
call
it
a
pure
wheat
ale
as
it
is
too
hoppy
the
tang
is
what
gets
me
with
the
hops
and
big
body
this
is
a
memorable
beer
overall
a
really
drinkable
flavorful
beer
really
hoppy
but
balanced
a
great
summer
beer
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavor
profile
is
nice
but
the
abv
is
getting
towards
the
high
end
which
limits
intake
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
very
unique
on
at
tap
at
bodega
on
the
patio
a
servers
suggestion
that
was
right
on
the
head
served
in
a
pint
glass
a
lightly
clear
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
nothing
special
pretty
light
honey
a
little
hops
on
the
back
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
body
with
a
small
white
head
that
lasts
for
about
two
minutes
the
nose
is
predominantly
hoppy
with
a
lot
of
orange
and
lemon
citrusy
notes
and
whispers
of
floral
aromas
tastewise
the
front
and
midpalates
are
remarkably
balanced
the
malts
are
caramelly
in
nature
and
the
hops
are
consistent
with
the
nose
the
hops
dont
dominate
until
the
finish
which
is
pretty
quick
and
dry
not
the
boldest
of
its
style
by
any
means
but
one
of
the
most
easily
drinkable
all
on
its
own
d
great
mix
of
flavour
complexity
with
a
hop
feature
that
i
always
enjoy
the
7
5
abv
is
well
concealed
and
the
bitter
leaves
me
thirsty
lagunitas
does
it
again
d
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
solid
brew
that
would
be
worth
a
repeat
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
hay
color
with
a
slightly
rocky
white
head
nice
fresh
citrus
aroma
with
a
lot
of
lemon
good
flavor
of
refreshing
citrus
and
hop
spice
theres
a
bit
of
wheat
at
the
finish
lightbodied
with
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
neither
an
ipa
nor
a
wheat
beer
but
something
very
inbetween
though
leaning
towards
the
ipa
it
is
really
refreshing
which
i
like
and
easy
to
drink
could
be
a
good
introduction
to
hops
for
wheat
beer
lovers
or
a
nice
staycation
for
ipa
lovers
well
done
d
the
tingle
of
the
hops
make
this
one
a
little
less
refreshing
than
other
brews
of
this
style
still
very
tasty
and
i
could
down
a
few
mfd
very
light
on
the
tongue
short
lasting
but
excellent
for
a
summer
afternoon
session
this
beer
is
heavy
on
the
hops
and
alcohol
and
light
on
the
malts
like
many
popular
california
brews
if
thats
your
thing
youll
like
this
beer
working
on
my
third
case
of
this
one
its
about
time
to
review
it
this
is
a
killer
session
beer
delicious
fruity
wheat
underneath
a
rush
of
tangy
and
piney
hops
crisp
and
refreshing
leaves
you
wanting
more
every
time
you
sip
it
nice
light
golden
color
head
is
ok
froths
up
nicely
at
first
and
quickly
dissipates
fresh
hoppy
punch
on
initial
taste
followed
by
a
sweet
pineapply
mid
palate
and
dry
crisp
finish
cant
get
enough
of
it
drink
it
fresh
d
this
is
not
your
runofthemill
wheat
beer
very
hoppy
with
some
nice
malt
flavors
that
help
make
this
a
little
more
complex
too
bad
i
only
bought
one
of
these
i
wish
more
were
on
the
shelf
d
not
for
me
but
if
you
like
this
style
i
am
sure
its
drinkable
as
it
is
very
light
the
hoppy
taste
will
really
sit
well
with
that
crowd
notes
another
remarkable
lagunitas
offering
this
is
certainly
highlighting
their
dexterity
with
hoppy
profiles
and
on
this
one
they
are
really
delivering
a
master
lesson
and
as
always
the
pricequality
ratio
is
remarkable
what
is
there
not
to
like
overall
to
me
this
brew
is
better
than
the
little
sumpin
extra
pale
ale
i
did
a
couple
shots
from
hard
luck
candy
made
in
mi
root
beer
barrel
vodka
and
still
managed
to
knock
down
5
out
of
the
6
pack
i
will
prolly
do
one
more
shot
and
finish
the
6
even
tho
im
hammered
i
will
say
this
is
prolly
lagunitas
best
brew
but
i
still
havent
had
the
maximus
ipa
this
was
the
summer
beer
of
choice
i
was
overtaken
in
a
good
way
by
the
citrusgrapefruit
scents
at
first
then
comes
the
creamy
smooth
texture
of
this
monster
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
summer
beer
of
all
time
will
await
the
year
round
releas
as
some
have
posted
great
job
lagunitas
overall
an
excellent
beer
the
flavors
here
are
complex
and
fruity
the
style
is
marked
as
a
wheat
beer
which
it
may
be
but
all
flavor
signs
point
to
an
ipa
and
a
welldone
one
at
that
another
great
one
from
lagunitas
definitely
a
hop
focused
wheat
that
while
not
overpowering
or
harsh
in
regards
to
hop
usage
a
bit
too
salty
and
tongue
drying
for
my
liking
in
any
event
a
thirst
quencher
for
sure
d
a
tasty
end
of
summer
selection
thanks
again
tb69
i
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
i
think
it
is
an
ipa
in
wheat
beer
clothes
basically
but
plenty
of
west
coast
hop
in
this
tasty
wheat
62
ibus
and
7
5
alcohol
i
guess
you
expect
that
from
a
super
sweet
and
hoppy
beer
its
very
fragrant
citrus
floral
with
a
pale
slightly
copper
color
the
head
doesnt
last
long
at
all
dont
even
bother
with
a
swirl
or
high
pour
all
youll
get
is
a
flatter
beer
rather
than
a
nice
foam
its
powereful
sweet
side
works
well
to
cut
through
spicy
food
mfd
this
has
body
feel
is
prickly
and
kinda
smooth
a
few
of
these
would
go
down
just
fine
d
medium
to
high
even
with
the
7
abv
not
normally
a
fan
of
many
wheat
offerings
but
this
is
an
ipa
with
some
wheat
in
it
so
im
loving
it
this
beer
really
blew
me
away
when
i
first
tried
it
and
i
was
pumped
to
find
out
that
they
recently
added
this
to
thier
year
round
line
up
great
effort
by
the
guys
at
lagunitas
value
you
sure
get
what
you
pay
for
with
these
lagunitas
beers
drinkability
i
noted
the
higher
abv
fairly
quickly
with
this
one
but
thats
because
it
was
so
good
that
i
drank
it
fairly
quickly
that
being
said
this
one
is
dangerous
i
want
another
one
but
i
know
i
shouldnt
it
its
a
great
beer
went
fantastic
with
a
meal
mustard
porkchops
and
potato
gnocchi
and
i
think
it
would
be
good
alone
also
i
can
see
why
so
many
people
have
rated
this
beer
highly
it
is
a
very
very
good
beer
the
taste
is
bitter
hops
with
a
mild
bit
of
wheat
tossed
in
i
could
not
drink
more
than
one
of
these
particularly
as
it
warms
drinkability
wow
i
really
like
this
one
a
very
nicely
done
summer
brew
lots
of
citrus
hop
aromaflavor
mild
hop
bitterness
and
an
easy
drinking
brew
for
such
a
high
abv
i
will
have
to
be
sure
to
pick
this
up
every
summer
mfd
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
smooth
the
drink
is
boarder
line
excellent
this
is
7
5
i
dont
think
so
drinkability
is
good
no
matter
what
time
of
year
it
is
drinkability
super
refreshing
and
tasty
like
i
said
this
beer
just
rubs
me
the
right
way
good
stuff
bottom
linein
bottles
i
can
give
this
an
a
or
b
on
draft
fresha
solid
a
d
considering
the
higher
abv
for
a
wheat
ale
this
goes
down
real
easy
d
this
is
one
killer
pale
wheat
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
a
great
summer
day
brew
for
labor
day
weekend
di
think
i
would
try
this
one
again
but
the
craft
beer
aisle
at
binnys
is
limitless
extremely
drinkable
has
a
huge
range
of
flavors
and
i
really
cant
even
put
this
beer
into
one
category
which
i
like
about
it
it
has
the
wheat
beer
flavors
but
also
those
of
an
india
pale
ale
combined
with
a
mouthfeel
i
would
expect
out
of
a
scottish
cream
ale
its
one
of
the
more
complex
flavor
profiles
i
have
found
with
lagunitas
and
it
wont
dissapoint
bye
nice
tasty
pale
wheat
glad
to
find
it
on
this
business
trip
mouthfeel
is
good
id
like
a
touch
more
creaminess
as
opposed
to
the
slightly
sharp
edge
the
carbonation
gives
this
but
the
body
is
lush
and
light
at
the
same
time
medium
in
weight
and
really
clean
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
and
will
be
adding
it
to
my
normal
rotation
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
apws
pours
a
deep
golden
color
thin
head
and
quickly
fading
lace
now
things
start
to
get
better
smells
fruity
along
with
some
pine
resin
then
the
first
taste
hops
hit
you
right
off
then
the
different
fruit
flavors
mixing
with
that
pine
resin
and
the
smooth
thick
mouthfeel
lets
you
know
that
your
drinking
a
nice
beer
here
drinkability
i
definitely
need
more
this
is
super
hoppy
for
the
style
and
might
be
one
of
my
favorite
lagunitas
beers
ever
nice
overall
a
great
brew
worthy
the
price
of
admission
this
beer
is
drinkable
given
the
abv
the
alcohol
makes
its
presence
known
but
isnt
overwhelming
by
any
means
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
the
drinkablility
is
great
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
golden
hue
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
minimal
head
the
evident
smells
are
light
floral
hops
the
taste
is
upfront
hops
without
being
overwhelming
somehow
this
beer
manages
to
be
both
light
and
hoppy
a
rare
breed
in
my
experiences
the
hop
bitterness
is
not
to
the
extent
of
an
ipa
but
the
hop
flavor
is
prevalent
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
brings
some
much
needed
interest
to
an
american
pale
wheat
beer
the
hops
are
everpresent
but
never
overpowering
the
alcohol
is
kept
well
in
check
while
definitely
a
sweet
beer
it
never
goes
syrupy
kudos
to
lagunitas
for
another
tasty
hop
heads
brew
d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
was
thinkingpale
wheat
ale
probably
not
my
style
but
this
one
delivered
but
i
do
try
to
be
as
open
minded
as
possible
about
very
hoppy
beers
tony
seems
to
have
found
a
great
balance
in
this
beer
which
allows
someone
like
me
to
enjoy
the
full
hop
flavor
without
being
overwhelmed
by
it
which
is
incredible
in
a
beer
at

d
im
impressed
somewhat
despite
myself
not
a
style
i
follow
and
i
generally
stick
to
lagunitas
strong
ales
they
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
it
costs
more
than
their
ipa
around
here
but
im
willing
to
pay
that
please
sir
may
i
have
some
more
drinks
great
easily
the
best
american
wheat
beer
ive
had
i
believe
maybe
off
style
a
tad
but
i
dont
care
this
goes
on
the
must
buy
list
for
summer
fall
wow
what
a
great
find
pours
a
dark
straw
color
lots
of
bubbles
and
carbonation
great
aroma
of
greapefruit
but
also
ripe
peaches
and
wheat
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
has
combined
two
great
styles
into
one
it
has
the
nice
little
kick
of
hops
from
an
ipa
with
the
smooth
thirst
quenching
hit
of
a
wheat
ale
its
like
biting
into
a
fresh
piece
of
juicy
fruit
and
grapefruit
all
at
the
same
time
this
is
an
outstanding
example
of
craft
beer
d
thanks
to
the
carbonation
that
hoppybitter
aspects
dont
linger
which
in
this
beer
is
a
good
thing
as
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
alcohol
is
nicely
masked
i
had
bought
the
last
bottle
really
wishing
i
had
another
overall
this
was
as
solid
as
they
come
really
just
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
something
i
would
do
again
in
a
minute
d
this
is
a
great
summer
time
ipa
super
smooth
and
nice
bitterness
this
is
a
favorite
of
mine
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
its
now
been
upgraded
to
a
year
round
release
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
many
sixers
of
this
wonderful
ale
going
forward
d
i
could
drink
this
very
often
and
dare
i
say
at
less
than
2bottle
i
can
see
this
replacing
a
greater
known
beer
i
dont
know
if
its
sessionable
since
its
rather
high
in
alcohol
but
i
can
easily
sip
this
on
a
warm
day
and
let
it
get
away
from
me
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
especially
since
they
are
threatening
this
as
a
limited
release
booo
i
liked
this
beer
at
the
beer
ontap
appearance
nice
head
and
lacing
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
pretty
amazing
i
was
very
impressed
by
it
and
drank
two
glasses
the
taste
is
creamy
and
good
feel
to
it
it
is
pretty
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
dvery
drinkable
more
than
one
is
certainly
possible
d
as
someone
who
enjoys
citrus
hops
this
one
was
a
great
beer
i
would
and
could
certainly
have
multiple
in
a
sitting
despite
the
7
abv
d
easy
to
drink
and
delicious
not
my
first
choice
for
a
summer
beer
but
it
is
damn
good
i
wish
this
wasnt
my
last
bottle
very
drinkable
in
fact
i
would
like
another
after
this
one
notes
this
beer
is
fantastic
it
has
the
lightness
and
crispness
of
a
wheat
but
the
flavor
profile
of
an
ipa
pick
this
limited
release
up
this
beer
has
fifty
percent
wheat
in
the
malt
bill
but
its
dry
hopped
like
an
ipa
this
is
a
beer
designed
to
let
the
hops
shine
through
and
it
does
so
beautifully
delicious
d
this
one
drinks
nice
for
a
7
4
wheat
beer
it
comes
off
much
more
as
an
ipa
than
a
pale
wheat
but
it
is
tasty
either
way
d
im
bored
by
this
no
suggestion
of
the
wheat
though
its
very
drinkable
like
all
of
lagunitas
beers
if
i
were
to
have
to
blind
taste
test
this
against
another
hoppy
lagunitas
beer
im
not
sure
that
i
could
tell
the
difference
its
pretty
much
just
like
any
other
strong
ipa
an
easy
drinker
indeed
pretty
ipa
like
for
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
but
i
still
dig
it
ddrinks
like
a
dream
the
surprisingly
high
abv
is
hidden
masterfully
this
is
supposedly
a
wheat
ale
more
like
a
sassy
ipa
love
it
i
think
and
have
had
agreeing
conversations
with
peers
that
this
beer
is
great
for
both
the
beerpros
and
the
newbies
if
this
was
presented
to
me
before
i
began
to
experiment
with
craft
beer
this
would
have
absolutely
changed
my
life
drinkability
average
to
good
simple
flavors
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
good
nonetheless
i
like
the
tropical
element
to
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
carbonation
is
above
average
drinkability
is
very
good
i
loved
the
tropical
citrus
flavors
the
hops
had
excellent
beer
overall
and
one
of
my
new
summer
favorites
pours
a
slight
hazy
copper
color
with
spare
head
spare
lacing
and
lively
carb
fruity
grapfruit
smell
taste
is
much
the
same
very
crisp
and
piney
as
well
light
body
average
flavor
duration
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
very
crisp
and
refreshing
seems
like
a
lot
of
lagunitas
beers
have
a
something
very
similar
to
them
and
this
one
was
no
differentbut
still
very
good
d
well
i
love
lagunitas
but
it
seems
only
for
their
big
beers
their
ipa
doesnt
seem
hopped
enough
and
this
was
just
a
hopped
up
pale
ale
pretty
bland
yet
still
love
the
company
d
a
very
well
made
beer
and
drinks
rather
nicely
d
dangerously
high
if
i
had
discovered
this
masterpiece
sooner
slash
if
it
had
come
to
portland
sooner
it
wouldve
been
my
summer
session
beer
d
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
easily
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
with
just
about
any
meal
overall
wonderfully
aromatic
balanced
snappy
and
tasty
hard
to
stop
at
just
one
a
fine
match
for
a
cheeseburger
with
the
works
one
of
my
favorites
from
lagunitas
dont
hesitate
buy
that
sixer
or
case
truly
an
outstanding
brew
d
an
outstanding
ipa
its
wellbalanced
but
still
packs
a
punch
highly
recommended
d
wow
this
is
quite
an
awesome
brew
insanely
quaffable
i
couldnt
put
my
glass
down
before
wanting
another
sip
only
downside
is
it
reminds
me
very
heavily
of
wilco
tango
foxtrot
except
in
appearance
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
color
with
foamy
two
finger
white
head
blobs
of
lace
smell
lots
of
pineapple
and
grapefruit
honeyed
biscuit
taste
pretty
serious
bash
of
grapefruit
and
pineapple
fades
to
a
sweet
pale
malt
with
a
hint
of
melon
maybe
some
wheat
in
the
tangy
finish
mouthfeel
prickly
active
carbonation
but
fairly
light
and
refreshing
this
would
be
the
best
pale
wheat
ever
still
pretty
damn
good
as
an
ipa
would
be
44

imagine
one
of
your
favorite
hoppy
ipas
and
a
classic
dry
wheat
beer
having
an
offspring
nicely
crafted
and
mighty
enjoyable
and
i
usually
dont
even
like
most
lagunitas
offerings
well
nix
that
this
is
a
slam
dunk
d
very
refreshing
beer
interesting
combination
of
flavors
nice
for
hot
summer
days
would
go
well
with
picnic
fare
definitely
would
order
this
beer
again
taste
is
nothing
spectacular
like
the
name
of
the
beer
would
suggest
but
its
still
pretty
darn
good
particularly
when
compared
against
similar
styles
nice
bit
of
fizz
light
mouthfeel
its
a
good
beer
for
summer
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
you
would
never
expect
the
high
abv
a
good
all
around
drink
well
done
notes
this
is
a
pretty
bitter
wheat
beer
but
definitely
very
drinkable
i
was
hoping
it
would
taste
a
lot
like
three
floyds
gumballhead
but
i
was
a
little
disappointed
its
much
less
fruity
and
tropical
than
gumballhead
but
good
just
the
same
goes
down
rather
well
but
its
very
lagunitas
styled
bitter
kind
of
sour
and
resiny
hopforward
not
too
refreshing
for
a
wheat
beer
and
not
quite
as
tasty
as
an
ipadipa
not
bad
though
damn
i
feel
like
im
drinking
an
ipa
super
hoppy
this
is
great
for
the
summer
too
bad
its
not
yearround
lagunitas
really
really
comes
though
with
this
one
recommended
to
anybody
drink
is
very
good
for
the
7
abv
doest
feel
this
strong
drinkability
wow
this
was
very
strong
in
the
hop
department
somewhat
to
its
disadvantage
a
bit
too
onenote
for
me
to
go
back
to
but
still
not
bad
scoring
this
one
to
style
is
tough
as
it
is
categorized
as
a
wheat
ale
here
but
this
has
far
more
ipa
characteristics
than
wheat
however
since
it
is
in
this
perhaps
wrong
category
its
gonna
score
really
high
for
me
as
i
hate
wheats
but
love
ipas

i
b
u
this
summer
wheat
ale
is
the
best
ive
had
in
a
long
time
easy
drinker
for
the
hop
head
in
us
all
d
ipa
meets
hefeweizen
very
drinkable
very
delicious
enjoy
this
morning
i
headed
over
to
the
store
where
i
got
this
and
bought
two
more
sixes
of
the
three
they
had
price
was
not
on
my
mind
i
think
it
was
10
or
11
i
apologized
for
hoarding
they
told
me
the
last
one
i
didnt
buy
is
the
last
one
they
will
have
it
had
just
come
in
thursday
and
that
was
all
they
will
get
california
is
a
long
way
from
ne
ohio
and
i
may
not
see
a
little
sumpin
again
for
a
while
but
it
sure
is
sumpin
good
tastes
like
the
wonderful
bastard
child
of
ipa
meets
summer
lager
incredibly
complex
while
remaining
light
enough
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
beautiful
combination
of
hops
and
malt
i
dont
do
the
citrusymelontarballbootheelplum
thing
but
to
me
too
many
lagunitas
brews
are
ruined
by
an
overpowering
taste
of
burned
sugar
not
this
one
a
real
classic
best
lagunitas
ive
tasted
thus
far
d
lagunitas
has
impressed
me
again
i
really
appreciate
what
comes
from
caly
i
am
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkabletasty
summer
beers
i
have
had
although
i
do
sense
some
confusion
with
the
entire
profile
of
the
beer
resembling
an
ipa
there
is
that
slight
spiced
wheat
presense
that
provides
integrity
of
the
brew
just
great
very
solid
beer
from
lagunitas
overall
im
dissappointed
in
this
brew
considering
its
reputation
its
not
even
close
to
gumballhead
in
any
aspects
having
said
that
it
has
its
own
pleasures
it
warms
nicely
making
it
something
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
hv
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
very
tasty
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
lagunitas
overall
a
nice
ipa
some
of
the
characteristics
remind
me
of
gubna
by
ob
but
its
more
reserved
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
crisp
yellow
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
aroma
is
some
crisp
citrus
hops
and
wheat
with
a
touch
of
spice
the
taste
is
more
like
a
wheat
beer
than
the
bottle
i
had
a
few
weeks
ago
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
citrus
hops
as
well
making
this
a
truly
unique
beer
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
slight
alcohol
presence
but
its
drinkable
this
is
a
truly
unique
beer
one
i
would
certainly
have
again
drinkability
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
very
good
and
unique
beer
with
a
beautiful
use
of
hops
to
bring
out
bright
vibrant
flavor
alcohol
is
well
integrated
very
good
beer
i
will
be
getting
while
i
can
get
it
blind
it
is
drinkable
good
hoppy
brew
but
where
the
hell
is
everything
else
overdone
likable
but
over
hopped
still
worth
trying
but
i
doubt
i
could
do
more
than
2
without
getting
a
little
bored
d
punchy
but
refreshing
an
excellent
summer
brew
i
had
one
on
a
very
warm
sunday
after
church
and
while
the
label
may
not
call
someone
to
seek
after
the
mysteries
of
the
divine
the
taste
definitely
will
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
thick
white
head
good
retention
and
great
lacing
smell
is
of
citric
hops
with
some
orange
and
lemon
very
much
like
a
good
west
coast
ipa
taste
was
similar
a
dry
wheatstraw
taste
at
first
followed
by
a
citrusy
hop
kick
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
velvety
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
oily
aftertaste
overall
a
great
beer
and
easy
drinker
this
almost
could
be
confused
for
an
ipa
if
you
ask
me
a
light
bodied
easy
sipper
with
the
alcohol
very
well
masked
pours
a
light
golden
almost
pilsnerlike
appearance
decent
head
and
persistent
lacing
fairly
hoppy
aroma
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
lagunitas
this
beer
is
pretty
interesting
because
it
is
a
wheat
beer
but
has
many
characteristics
of
a
hoppy
pale
ale
i
get
wheat
beer
on
the
front
end
with
a
bitter
pale
ale
finish
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
from
a
typical
summer
beer
a
good
amount
of
hops
but
not
over
the
top
overall
this
is
a
beer
id
consider
having
again
however
it
wasnt
one
which
left
a
memorable
impression
im
not
tasting
any
wheat
in
here
though
on
their
website
lagunitas
coyly
implies
that
theres
only
a
slight
wheat
influence
anyway
im
grading
this
beer
as
something
between
an
ipa
and
a
dipa
its
clear
that
the
intention
is
to
provide
a
nice
multifaceted
hop
treat
to
the
drinker
it
is
successful
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
last
year
but
it
never
made
it
out
to
denver
this
year
it
did
poured
a
nice
light
goldenstraw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
good
piney
hops
dominate
both
the
nose
and
palate
although
the
malt
is
there
and
it
balances
this
one
out
nicely
not
sure
its
worth
10
99
a
6
pack
though
verdict
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
is
an
enjoyable
little
beer
its
tasty
easily
drinkable
and
packs
a
hidden
punch
as
far
as
summer
seasonals
go
this
is
just
what
im
looking
for
d
a
decent
wheat
ale
with
some
nice
citrus
and
orange
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
try
again
drinks
well
enough
very
good
value
at
about
7
50
for
a
six
pack
good
flavor
aboveaverage
drinkability
i
would
probably
buy
another
sixer
of
this
in
the
future
i
was
hoping
for
more
wheat
and
balance
when
drinking
this
beer
the
hops
arent
complex
enough
to
warrant
a
high
score
for
taste
either
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
thick
and
frothy
white
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
pretty
lacing
the
aroma
is
bursting
with
juicy
hops
notes
of
citrus
pine
mango
along
with
wheat
honey
biscuit
caramel
and
a
little
rye
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
piney
and
citrusy
hops
upfront
along
with
mango
and
grapefruit
a
wheaty
twang
cane
sugar
honey
biscuit
fruity
esters
and
a
little
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
and
drinkability
is
excellent
an
excellent
beer
from
lagunitas
its
tasty
and
drinkable
and
is
quite
the
bargain
to
boot
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
excellent
retention
and
very
nice
laceing
aroma
is
of
citrusand
piney
hops
body
is
medium
and
very
carbonated
taste
is
more
like
an
ipa
very
hopped
up
front
with
a
bit
of
a
bready
presence
hoppy
finish
wheres
the
wheat
nice
beer
one
of
the
most
drinkable
hoppy
beers
out
there
i
am
blown
away
by
how
good
this
beer
is
awesome
drinkability
so
enjoyable
to
drink
lagunitas
knows
how
to
hop
things
up
and
this
is
no
exception
no
problem
tipping
back
a
few
of
these
but
at
over
seven
percent
watch
out
bit
hot
and
much
like
the
undercover
investigation
shutdown
ale
what
i
think
they
should
do
is
try
brewing
a
different
beer
other
than
bottling
one
that
didnt
quite
turn
out
the
same
as
the
last
batch
and
calling
it
something
different
huge
on
hops
sugary
sweet
and
too
much
like
the
rest
of
their
other
offerings
kind
of
lost
on
this
one
d
im
sold
on
this
beer
being
my
go
to
summer
beer
when
im
down
on
money
a
little
lagunitas
does
some
amazing
things
with
hops
this
is
no
exception
they
do
a
great
job
with
their
pricing
as
well
as
making
some
of
the
most
wonderful
beers
ive
tasted
better
than
gumballhead
i
would
say
drinkability
nothing
stood
out
for
me
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
wheat
ale
i
would
not
go
for
this
one
i
think
it
was
on
the
fringes
of
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
overall
but
compared
to
others
in
the
same
class
definitely
nontraditional
d
this
was
a
nice
bitter
beer
i
dont
see
why
they
want
it
classified
as
a
pale
wheat
ale
this
was
more
of
an
ipa
to
me
a
nice
beer
for
the
summer
or
a
hop
fix
reminds
me
of
the
first
time
i
had
gumballhead
the
comparison
is
hardly
valid
but
for
an
outsidethenorm
pale
wheat
hit
it
up
d
an
absolutely
fantastic
summer
beer
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
lagunitas
update
having
been
through
cases
upon
cases
of
this
this
is
consistently
great
a
great
head
every
time
fresh
every
time
great
mouthfeel
perfectly
carbonated
nose
not
as
good
as
gumballhead
and
the
abv
is
a
bit
high
for
me
but
otherwise
great
this
is
the
beer
that
turned
my
wife
to
the
dark
side
and
also
her
best
friend
a
great
gateway
beer
one
time
a
year
for
its
release
is
too
long
to
wait
i
need
my
little
sumpin
sumpin
fix
great
beer
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
alcohol
content
is
perfect
to
make
this
a
heavy
session
beer
looking
forward
to
summer
to
see
this
pretty
lady
again
dquite
flavorful
with
pleasant
orange
and
tangerine
hp
notes
malt
backing
is
present
but
doesnt
get
in
the
way
nice
job
and
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
thoughts
this
was
my
favorite
new
beer
this
summer
an
wheat
ale
that
bent
the
style
lines
just
enough
to
make
it
unique
and
flavorly
wonderful
at
the
same
time
appearance
looks
like
nothing
special
in
fact
it
looks
a
little
light
and
cloudy
to
be
good
like
a
mass
produced
hefe
but
the
aroma
starts
to
tip
its
hand
that
this
is
a
quality
brew
and
then
the
taste
so
strong
bitter
and
then
bam
like
i
dunno
stone
ipa
or
speakeasy
ipa
it
just
is
gone
so
crisp
like
outkast
so
fresh
and
so
clean
very
drinkable
light
on
the
palate
and
yet
so
bitter
and
hoppy
im
thinkin
crystal
malt
and
simcoe
hops
all
over
this
one
poured
a
honey
color
quite
cloudy
with
a
small
white
colored
head
aroma
was
easily
detectable
but
not
overpowering
and
consisted
of
a
sweet
orange
and
grapefruit
combination
very
inviting
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
sweet
rather
than
tart
citrus
mandarin
orange
and
grapefruit
bitterness
on
a
barely
detectable
crystal
malt
backbone
ending
in
a
slightly
dry
finish
a
bit
warming
as
well
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
lightmedium
body
overall
although
this
offering
is
not
overly
complex
i
wish
this
wasnt
a
limited
edition
as
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
and
went
back
to
the
store
to
get
the
last
bottle
i
could
put
down
quite
a
few
but
id
pay
the
price
the
next
morning
notes
very
flavorful
beer
has
a
dry
and
wethopped
combo
going
on
aroma
and
flavor
is
fantastic
probly
my
favorite
beer
from
them
would
not
have
guessed
this
had
anything
to
do
with
the
wheat
category
clear
enough
to
read
through
the
glass
single
finger
head
but
it
relaxes
slowly
the
color
is
neutral
amber
lots
of
classic
pine
needle
hop
aromalike
an
ipa
the
flavor
matches
the
aroma
noteworthy
alcohol
feel
and
flavor
lots
of
hop
bite
almost
from
the
beginning
the
body
is
rich
and
gives
an
element
of
rounded
malt
tastes
i
dont
really
note
any
wheat
in
this
one
but
its
still
a
very
good
pale
ale
d
i
dont
care
if
this
has
an
abv
of
7
3
i
have
no
problem
drinking
a
6
pack
in
a
sitting
one
of
my
favorites
this
summer
without
a
doubt
ontap
at
the
spinnerstown
hotel
4
for
a
tulip
not
a
bad
deal
it
appeared
hazy
yellow
with
a
tall
white
head
the
aroma
reminds
me
immediately
of
orange
soda
but
then
pineapple
kicks
in
to
make
it
more
of
a
tropical
citrus
fruit
punch
the
flavor
is
equally
juicy
at
first
but
they
dries
out
with
a
bit
of
plain
malted
wheat
and
peppery
hop
bitterness
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
shortlived
middle
ages
imperial
double
wheat
its
big
hoppy
but
not
terribly
bitter
all
in
all
a
pretty
tasty
beer
d
great
my
favorite
from
lbc
so
far
easy
drinking
but
full
flavored
keeps
enticing
me
back
for
more
id
order
another
and
buy
a
sixer
again
d
i
generally
dont
like
wheat
beers
love
this
one
very
balanced
cant
believe
its
7
3
well
hidden
was
sort
of
hoping
for
more
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
like
it
was
supposed
to
be
and
less
of
an
ipa
because
if
you
didnt
tell
me
what
it
was
thats
what
i
would
have
guessed
too
bad
lagunitas
couldnt
lay
off
the
hops
a
little
but
i
guess
thats
what
they
do
still
a
good
beer
though
it
appears
as
though
the
folks
at
lagunitas
have
stumbled
upon
this
hop
profile
that
they
are
now
using
to
hop
the
hell
out
of
a
fairly
basic
pale
wheat
not
sure
if
i
dislike
it
or
love
it
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
akin
to
maybe
dfh
90
minute
hop
forward
with
a
malty
background
without
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
my
beer
of
the
year
for
2009
loved
it
when
it
was
totally
fresh
love
it
as
it
gets
a
bit
older
very
unique
taste
up
front
and
that
great
lagunitas
hop
onslaught
on
the
back
end
balanced
but
just
a
nice
amount
of
sweetness
hard
to
believe
the
abv
is
over
7
on
this
masterpiece
juicy
greatness
and
just
a
true
joy
to
drink
over
and
over
glorious
drinkability
although
this
isnt
what
i
expected
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
i
will
absolutely
pick
this
one
up
again
next
time
i
see
it
its
downright
drinkable
and
if
it
wasnt
for
the
abv
id
tear
through
a
sixer
of
this
in
no
time
at
all
go
phils
d
drinks
like
a
session
beer
but
will
kick
your
ass
at
7
7
d
drinkability
was
good
but
not
mind
blowing
this
is
definitely
not
a
session
type
beer
but
it
does
get
progressively
easier
interesting
yes
a
little
sumpin
offers
something
off
the
beaten
path
in
the
way
of
hoppy
wheats
which
drank
like
a
amped
up
southern
tier
422
di
love
drinking
this
smooth
beer
there
is
no
fusal
alcohol
at
all
to
this
beer
a
very
drinkable
beer
given
the
higher
abv
thank
you
lagunitas
go
get
some
little
sumpin
extra
ale
it
is
very
good
d
easily
drinkable
this
is
solid
lagunitas
worth
a
shot
knowing
that
it
was
more
hoptastic
than
most
apwas
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
that
this
would
be
good
beer
truth
be
told
its
hoppier
more
delicious
and
more
drinkable
than
imagined
if
you
crave
the
little
green
cones
like
i
do
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
joins
three
floyds

on
the
top
of
the
american
pale

pile
thanks
to
mikey711
for
the
bottle
md
sticky
and
resinous
without
being
over
carbonated
the
texture
is
perfect
i
would
drink
this
every
time
i
barbecued
if
i
had
it
on
hand
d
found
this
to
be
hard
to
finish
not
usually
my
mo
wouldnt
have
it
again
cheers
clear
dark
yellow
strong
hop
aroma
dense
head
fall
away
as
you
drink
and
leaves
lacing
although
i
dont
consider
that
important
some
on
this
site
do
sweet
malt
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
in
aroma
this
is
a
warming
beer
the
bitterness
is
the
first
thing
i
notice
when
i
drink
it
second
a
brightness
associated
with
high
alcohol
beers
the
alcohol
is
noticable
not
bad
just
noticable
bitterness
also
builds
as
you
drink
im
very
pleased
with
this
beer
a
good
ipa
d
the
aroma
is
the
highmark
for
this
beer
the
taste
has
a
slightly
off
bitterness
to
it
that
diminishes
an
other
wise
nice
lemonwheat
flavor
again
this
beer
smells
and
looks
like
it
should
be
a
nice
refreshing
brew
but
alas
it
falls
short
body
is
medium
bodied
as
is
the
carbonation
a
slightly
more
vigorous
carbonation
would
be
appreciated
drinkability
is
a
bit
of
a
conundrum
served
fresh
this
is
a
quenching
hopmonster
for
the
style
however
im
not
sure
a
7
3
abv
is
necessary
i
like
my
pale
wheats
to
be
sessionable
and
boy
do
i
want
to
down
a
sixer
of
this
in
a
hurry
that
however
is
not
recommended
all
together
this
a
well
put
together
ale
certainly
in
the
west
coast
tradition
of
brilliant
hops
but
could
use
some
work
recommended
for
hop
heads
who
are
hesitant
to
sample
wheat
beers
this
quickly
became
one
of
my
goto
beers
for
the
summer
upon
my
last
haul
i
was
sad
to
see
it
had
disappeared
off
the
shelves
at
all
the
stores
around
town
d
finish
is
a
bit
to
mediciol
for
my
tastes
in
a
pale
wheat
ale
just
too
much
hops
here
i
think
but
otherwise
a
well
executed
beer
worth
a
shot
our
of
curiosity
for
what
could
be
considered
an
imperial
pale
wheat
ale
d
this
is
easily
my
new
favorite
offering
from
lagunitas
this
is
a
really
citrusforward
brew
with
fresh
grapefruit
out
the
wazoo
almost
like
ballast
point
dorado
without
the
alcohol
presence
awesome
d
this
is
a
great
beer
definitely
a
summer
beer
but
for
the
hop
lover
i
hear
there
is
a
lil
sumpin
extra
coming
out
i
cant
wait
in
the
meantime
ill
be
drinking
this
d
a
fantastic
balance
between
summer
wheat
and
ipa
an
excellent
brew
well
this
was
quite
a
first
experience
with
lagunitas
and
one
that
will
ensure
im
back
for
more
the
best
pale
wheat
ale
ive
had
yet
a
wonderful
experience
if
youre
looking
for
something
unique
and
refreshing
but
with
a
bit
of
bite
and
body
go
with
this
brew
i
cant
believe
this
is
a
wheat
it
is
full
of
hops
and
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
which
i
like
very
much
worth
searching
out
it
pours
with
a
small
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
as
you
finish
it
has
a
nice
bronze
color
has
a
nice
peppery
ipa
smell
the
hops
jumps
right
out
at
you
and
stays
with
you
till
the
end
very
good
effort
i
just
wasnt
feeling
this
beer
its
definitely
not
a
wheat
beer
and
its
not
even
that
good
of
an
ipa
i
had
pretty
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
i
definetly
prefer
southern
tier
uber
sun
and
three
floyds
gumballhead
but
this
is
a
decent
summer
offering
and
is
worth
checking
out
d
such
a
nice
beer
would
like
to
see
it
in
bottle
overall
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
beer
from
lagunitas
i
have
been
mixed
on
them
in
the
past
thinking
some
are
great
and
other
fall
short
of
expectations
this
beer
exceeded
what
i
was
expecting
o
awesome
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
would
be
insulting
anybody
by
saying
this
but
its
like
a
light
dipa
im
going
to
keep
this
in
the
fridge
as
long
as
its
around
medium
bodied
less
carbonation
than
im
used
to
for
a
wheat
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
mouthfeel
7
3
abv
is
completely
masked
this
was
at
a
beer
bar
and
no
one
at
the
place
knew
what
kind
of
style
it
was
i
tried
a
small
glass
and
wasnt
able
to
tell
myself
after
reading
that
its
an
american
wheat
it
makes
sense
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
a
little
strong
to
have
the
typical
advantages
of
a
wheat
refeshing
etc
good
color
carbonation
and
smell
a
little
short
on
taste
and
mouthfeel
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
not
quite
a
session
brew
keeping
7
3
in
mind
but
it
wont
spoil
your
dinner
drinkability
a
dangerous
brew
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
high
abv
will
knock
tour
socks
off
big
floral
hop
taste
that
turns
into
grapefruit
and
ends
bittersweet
the
more
i
drink
it
the
better
it
seems
to
show
all
its
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
good
i
love
the
combonation
of
wheat
and
hops
like
this
a
good
reminder
that
i
need
to
keep
trying
with
hop
heavy
styles
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just
a
hybrid
style
that
i
think
is
a
bad
idea
wheat
beers
are
light
and
drinkable
hop
the
shit
out
of
it
and
that
brings
it
down
overall
this
is
by
no
means
a
traditional
wheat
beer
however
like
most
of
lagunitas
brews
the
hops
are
a
nice
addition
this
is
worth
a
shot
d
rates
only
a
good
simply
because
i
think
i
was
looking
for
something
lighter
as
a
summer
seasonal
with
that
said
i
love
it
i
will
buy
a
6pack
tomorrow
and
another
next
week
this
might
take
1st
place
in
my
lagunitas
lineup
behind
my
favorite
brown
shugga
pours
a
pretty
hazy
golden
amber
very
huge
and
thick
white
head
forms
slowly
settles
leaving
a
shit
ton
of

on
the

looks
pretty

alright

some

is
similar
lots
of

character
yeast
lots
of
citrus

sweetness
through

middle
lightly

some

decent

mouthfeel
is
a

thin
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
refreshing
not
too
bad
but
a
little
let
down
well
then
this
stuff
is
straight
out
of
left
field
and
a
wonderful
surprise
its
got
it
all
in
the
right
places
at
the
right
time
even
though
i
really
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
in
advance
im
going
to
have
to
pick
up
more
to
hang
on
to
if
this
is
a
limited
edition
even
the
girl
on
the
label
is
pure
retro
pinup
cheesecake
kitschy
bliss
somehow
this
beer
manages
to
cater
to
all
of
my
guilty
pleasures
yet
with
enough
quality
to
abolish
any
guilt
whatsoever
overall
reminds
me
of
a
gumballhead
which
is
a
good
thing
if
anything
better
in
the
bottle
as
wheat
beers
sometimes
are
great
beer
and
a
homerun
for
lagunitas
much
much
hoppier
than
the
average
wheat
but
the
hops
wotk
here
combined
with
the
slightly
sweet
fruitiness
of
the
wheat
and
yeasty
esters
pours
golden
with
a
relatively
thin
head
and
excellent
clarity
smells
hoppy
tangy
and
slightly
sweet
with
notes
of
bubblegum
and
citrus
highly
herbal
with
some
of
the
same
dill
notes
ive
picked
up
in
a
few
other
west
coast
hoppy
beers
recently
with
exponential
hoppiness
being
the
king
of
that
flavor
i
wonder
which
hop
or
combination
of
hops
are
giving
me
that
taste
regardless
i
really
like
the
effect
particularly
with
the
tanginess
of
the
wheat
and
the
fruity
sweetness
of
the
yeast
i
love
the
taste
of
this
tangy
and
herbal
piney
and
citrusy
and
fruity
all
together
extremely
smooth
followed
by
a
spritzy

thanks

and

overall
i
was
pleased
with
the
little
sumpin
sumpin
after
fearing
i
had
missed
it
this
season
another
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
d
very
drinkable
the
hops
in
both
the
flavor
and
in
the
nose
remind
me
of
a
toned
down
hop
stupid
it
is
well
balanced
as
it
has
a
pretty
strong
dose
of
malt
and
most
of
the
hop
character
is
devoted
to
flavor
and
aroma
rather
than
bitterness
one
of
lagunitas
best
the
mouth
was
pleasantly
oily
and
coating
very
easy
to
drink
i
had
three
with
my
bbq
i
also
did
not
realize
it
had
a
relatively
high
abv
until
looking
on
ba
i
guess
that
may
explain
my
slightly
hazy
recollection
of
the
cubs
game
or
it
could
have
been
the
additional
5
or
so
old
styles
cubs
won
120

think
i
won

im
drinking
this
fast
had
this
as
part
of
a
tasting
session
with
a
buddy
a
while
back
poured
a
bronze
color
with
white
head
that
faded
slowly
and
left
decent
lacing
smelled
of
pine
hops
and
malt
tasted
of
pine
hops
malt
and
citrusy
fruit
quite
smooth
just
slightly
dry
would
have
been
nice
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
md
this
drinks
and
feels
like
a
lighter
ipa
with
some
really
interesting
smells
to
it
i
could
drink
a
whole
bunch
of
these
d
this
beer
is
soft
on
the
bitterness
which
is
good
but
it
is
huge
on
the
pungency
of
the
hops
they
are
well
supported
by
pineapple
and
grass

it
is

beer
for
a

the
local
didnt
know
what
to
expect
first
american
pale

ale
and
drinks
like
a

with
some
slight
creaminess
to
it
as
well
average

and
a
bitter

great
flavor
citrus
and
a
small
amount
of
wheat
at
first
a
clear
body
and
the

but
i
do
think
theres
something
spicy
that
makes
this
more
of
a

a

i
agree
with
the
previous
review
that
this
is
not
like
other

beers
the
wheat
gives
this
a
very
earthy
and

with
the
obvious
pale

attributes
very

very

the

again

i
like

im
trying
not

be

harsh
but
i
really
could
not
drink
this
beer
it
poured
well
had
a
nice
hazy
unfiltered
look
with
a
descent
head
what
you
should
expect
from
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
but
immediately
i
could
tell
that
i
wasnt
going
to
like
it
the
aroma
was
overwhelmingly
of
banana
esters
and
sweet
off
bubblegum
like
flavors
i
took
a
sip
and
it
was
just
more
of
the
same
after
two
sips
i
decided
that
i
couldnt
drink
it
its
probably
just
my
personal
preference
since
i
hate
bananas
if
it
was
a
flavor
that
i
enjoyed
this
probably
could
have
been
a
good
beer
odd
that
it
has
such
a
distinct
and
odd
flavor
profile
oh
well
cheers
an
excellent
unfiltered
heff
very
smooth
but
has
a
tangy
zest
to
it
no
much
wheat
or

but
an
excellent
overall
heff
thing
of

but
more
character
and

was
ok
i
found
myself
trying
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the

i
can

out

owould
be

drinkable
if
it

a

such

definitely

the

excellent
well

and

this
is
the
best
summer
seasonal
ive
had
this
year
i
really
need
to
try
and
get
up
to
the
brewery
soon
and
try
a
fresh
draft
of
this
o
this
is
a
bottle
from
the
summer
that
has
been
around
for
awhile
im
sure
i
would
enjoy
it
even
more
if
it
was

and

and
crisply
carbonated
works

with
the
taste
overall
i
could
drink
a
half
gallon
of
this
very
thirst
quenching
beer
even
better
if
it
wasnt
january
in
minnesota
but
rather
july
an
above
average
ale
overall
this
is
a
nice
wheat
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
typical
wheat
beer
it
is
technically
flawless
but
it
does
not
jump
out
as
anything
amazing
that
being
said
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
rather
enjoyable
o
refreshing
with
a
bolder
flavor
profile
than
most
summer
seasonals
nice
raw
wheat
character
fine
whatever
but
at
6
id
expect
a
very
different
experience
more
esters
to
start
with
and
a
bit
more
grain
and
maybe
hops
on
the
palate
this
should
be
better
the
palate
is
light
in
body
and
opens
moderately
strong
on
the
clove
but
without
enough
banana
the
fruit
profile
from
the
yeast
of
courseis
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
and
coupled
with
the
thin
palate
with
bready
flavors
but
without
the
fullness
from
the
wheat
this
beer
does
come
across
as
flawed
in
addition
the
acidity
while
higher
than
youd
expect
doesnt
really
work
with
the
flavor
profile
the
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
adding
to
the
acidity
and
keeping
the
finish
from
picking
up
too
much
flavor
while
this
is
a
rather
excellent
combination
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
a
hefeweizen
it
does
by
definition
come
up
short
on
the
hedonic
scale

def
purchase
again
a
very
tasty
light
wheat
brew
to
compliment
a
day
out
during
summer
classic
wheat
beer
that
doesnt
deviate
from
the
formula
but
is
very
easy
on
the
lips
good
beer
overall
this
beer
is
simply
fantastic
im
really
impressed
drinks
closer
to
a
hefeweizen
but
i
can
definitely
taste
the
saison
influence
particularly
in
the
finish
only
available
in
the
summer
months
boo
we
want
yearround
release
an
easy
drinking
well
made
beer
definitely
well
suited
for
warm
weather
d
extra
cold
on
a
hot
day
not
too
bad
i
would
bet
ive
had
the
solace
many
times
before
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
rated
it
it
was
just
like
i
remembered
it
decent
but
not
good
it
is
good
for
a
junejuly
day
though
overall
this
is
very
good
a
pretty
simplistic
beer
but
a
great
representation
of
the
style
its
another
flavorful
beer
in
the
loweralcohol
range
so
i
give
it
some
credit
but
that
bitterish
cardboard
aftertaste
just
doesnt
go
away
12
oz
bottle
from
trader
joes
o
a
very
good
wheat
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
and
hopefully
will
be
able
to
again
on
draft
o
very
drinkable
but
ultimately
plain
wheat
beer
overall
straightforward
wheat
beer
that
doesnt
have
much
to
distinguish
itself
from
others
within
the
style
o
the
overall
flavor
is
clean
and
crisp
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
a
very
good
wheat
with
some
german
roots
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
fruity
summer
wheat
beer
maybe
my
favorite
of
the
season
thus
far
pours
a
hazy
golden
to
brassy
orange
color
with
an
average
white
head
smells
like
hefe
yeast
banana
notes
some
spice
flavor
is
equally
yeast
dominated
with
a
major
fresh
banana
palate
also
some
good
wheat
malts
in
there
that
give
it
a
light
but
flavorful
body
and
some
late
hop
additions
that
crisp
it
right
up
in
the
finish
and
make
it
feel
lighter
than
it
is
feel
is
excellent
for
a
summer
beer
enough
body
there
to
maintain
interest
but
also
very
drinkable
a
good
outdoors
beer
bright
carbonation
and
quick
finish
make
it
a
nice
refresher
without
being
too
fruity
or
citric
overall
a
well
balanced
summer
beer
and
a
major
departure
from
the
woody
hop
bombs
firestone
walker
usually
produces
nevertheless
it
is
very
refreshing
the
inclusion
of
lemonlike
spices
make
a
great
substitute
for
an
actual
lemon
or
orange
and
its
still
full
of
great
flavors
i
really
wish
this
was
as
juicy
in
feel
or
spicier
in
taste
but
its
still
a
good
take
on
the
style
and
is
recommended
a
try
overall
i
thought
id
try
something
different
firestone
markets
it
as
a
limited
edition
it
should
remain
that
way
to
be
fair
i
usually
go
for
stouts
mostly
porters
overall
this
one
may
have
a
bit
of
age
on
it
hence
the
prominence
of
the
sour
twang
still
the
combination
of
flavors
of
an
american
wheat
and
a
saison
are
not
something
i
would
really
crave
again
o
ill
be
curious
to
see
how
this
does
in
the
warmer
upcoming
weather
seems
like
a
nice
refreshing
american
pale
wheat
ale
overall
this
was
a
delicious
version
of
american
wheat
ale
probably
one
of
my
more
favorite
ones
flavors
are
well
rounded
and
you
could
easily
drink
alot
of
these
pours
hazy
orange
with
slight
head
that
fades
quickly
the
banana
and
cloves
remind
me
of
a
german
hef
rather
than
an
american
also
oranges
as
well
a
bit
of
spice
from
the
yeast
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
saison
a
great
summer
beer
i
love
you
firestone
walker
overall
an
easy
to
consume
beer
this
one
is
not
overly
exciting
either
but
drinkable
pours
a
hazy
maizegold
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
yeast
hint
of
alcohol
citrus
hint
of
hop
and
a
hint
of
dough
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
dough
yeast
slight
citrus
hint
of
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
poor
appearance
but
good
aroma
feel
and
body
o
wow
is
this
good
a
complex
flavorful
brew
that
blue
moon
only
wishes
it
could
be
this
is
my
new
favorite
for
the
style
kudos
to
firestone
walker
overall
this
beer
does
not
wow
me
in
any
way
it
is
decent
but
like
a
lot
of
other
apwas
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
revisit
this
well
again
anytime
soon
overall
impression
great
wheat
beer
could
definitely
enjoy
several
of
these
i
cant
think
of
another
wheat
off
hand
that
id
rather
have
taste
is
grain
light
raisiny
alcohol
fermented
pears
hint
of
clovelike
bubblegum
lemony
zestiness
its
a
bit
sweet
but
has
good
wellrounded
character
and
good
depth
it
has
a
nice
full
feel
and
is
very
enjoyable
overall
impression
this
hefe
was
almost
stronger
than
the
abvs
are
listed
i
didnt
mind
this
though
since
the
citrus
flavor
was
so
dominant
since
this
is
a
limited
release
i
dont
think
im
going
to
be
seeing
this
one
anytime
soon
until
next
summer
if
i
go
back
to
cali
i
am
drinking
this
in
the
mid
to
upper
40s
and
it
really
brings
out
some
great
flavors
still
clean
and
easy
drinking
but
tons
of
layers
of
flavors
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
would
love
to
have
one
tap
o
i
didnt
believe
i
thought
firestone
was
a
meh
brewery
this
beer
proves
me
wrong
nicely
done
firestone
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
1
inch
fluffy
bone
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
sticky
chunks
of
foam
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
spices
yeast
and
some
citrus
aromas
taste
is
of
wheat
bread
mild
spices
yeast
and
some
citrus
zest
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
wheat
beer
that
is
nice
and
refreshing
to
drink
dr
its
very
drinkable
and
with
how
light
it
is
im
impressed
its
6
id
have
it
again
on
draught
i
wish
it
were
more
complex
but
for
what
its
trying
to
do
its
successful
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
this
brewery
poured
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
decent
cap
of
bubbly
offwhite
foam
aromas
of
floral
hops
somewhat
grassy
bubblegum
and
biscuit
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
good
hops
as
well
as
some
pears
peaches
and
biscuit
malt
o
beyond
its
lackluster
appearance
nothing
really
wrong
with
the
beer
nose
a
little
muted
and
maybe
should
be
a
bit
more
carbonated
just
seemed
to
have
a
couple
misses
here
and
there
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
wheat
ale
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
always
good
alternative
on
a
hot
day
better
of
the
style
in
my
opioin
i
could
probably
sit
down
and
drink
a
6
pack
to
myself
light
and
resfreshing
wish
it
came
in
cans
so
i
can
take
it
to
the
pool
lol
o
disappointing
only
because
this
is
firestone
im
getting
to
a
point
where
if
their
beer
doesnt
blow
me
away
then
im
disappointed
still
a
good
beer
the
aroma
was
odd
very
light
and
almost
non
existent
at
times
what
was
there
seemed
a
touch
artificial
to
me
to
be
honest
light
grain
and
some
off
fruit
notes
not
very
appealing
at
all
the
flavor
was
a
little
bit
better
but
still
very
weak
in
my
eyes
it
started
with
a
nice
rush
of
light
grain
some
mild
fruitiness
as
well
light
touches
of
peach
and
passion
fruit
i
guess
highlighting
it
but
leaving
quickly
with
only
a
touch
of
light
grass
like
flavor
in
the
finish
which
was
itself
shortlived
hazy
yellowamber
with
a
thin
skim
and
collar
of
white
bubbles
wheat
cracker
aroma
slight
fruitiness
toast
mild
citrus
and
spiciness
low
bitterness
with
wheat
and
malt
not
a
lot
of
sweetness
toasty
with
a
flash
of
grassy
hops
and
slight
spiciness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
low
side
fairly
dry
its
well
done
for
what
it
is
a
subtle
beer
thats
not
out
to
clobber
you
with
over
the
top
aromas
or
flavours
overall
i
was
not
too
impressed
especially
at
10
for
a
6
pack
its
watery
with
too
much
banana
for
me
it
does
get
a
bit
better
as
it
warms
o
a
great
summer
beer
a
bavarian
style
hef
flavorfull
without
the
fillingness
a
refreshing
summer
seasonal
ale
thats
worth
a
try
overall
a
tastyenough
beer
but
i
rate
it
around
average
a
bit
more
sweet
spice
to
it
than
anticipated
for
an
american
wheat
ale
its
likely
that
this
one
is
better
on
draught
so
i
will
keep
my
eyes
out
for
it
overall
this
is
definately
a
good
version
of
the
style
im
not
sure
why
the
other
reviewers
dont
see
it
that
way
maybe
if
they
used
wild
yeasts
barrel
aged
it
and
made
it
12
abv
it
would
score
higher
i
dont
know
that
firestone
walker
could
release
any
brand
of
ordinarystyle
beer
that
would
come
anywhere
close
to
matching
the
ratings
of
their
limited
higher
gravity
offerings
still
solace
is
a
terribly
disappointing
offering
from
a
brewery
capable
of
not
only
complex
blended
beers
but
great
conventional
brands
like
union
jack
and
double
barrel
as
well
overall
i
did
not
like
this
i
generally
dont
like
wheats
or
hefes
so
for
me
to
not
like
this
is
pretty
on
par
for
the
style
i
must
say
it
stayed
musty
and
earthy
this
was
a
bit
sweet
though
o
great
summer
beer
refreshing
im
not
nearly
as
learned
as
most
id
bet
but
this
reminded
me
more
of
a
saison
ala
great
divides
colette
somewhere
between
juicy
and
semidry
this
is
beer
has
a
smooth
semifull
mouthfeel
with
spicy
and
fruity
notes
im
getting
a
flashback
from
my
cider
days
in
edinburgh
theres
also
yeast
of
course
carbonation
is
assertive
definitely
worth
a
try
firestone
walker
does
so
much
great
but
maybe
they
need
to
revamp
the
recipe
for
solace
to
really
drive
sales
on
this
one
a
solid
if
unexceptional
witbier
fine
o
the
flavor
was
decent
enough
but
the
carbonation
was
distracting
i
would
drink
this
again
if
it
were
there
but
i
dont
think
id
spend
any
money
on
it
good
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
there
are
more
interesting
summer
offerings
o
very
drinkable
and
a
decent
summer
beer
overall
probably
would
not
go
well
with
food
o
overall
a
decent
beer
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
farmhouse
ale
but
not
completely
there
it
is
a
little
sweet
for
my
liking
and
the
taste
just
makes
me
want
to
have
a
nice
saison
im
not
finding
solace
in
solace
the
flavors
arent
bad
but
there
are
better
more
refreshing
wheats
out
there
o
though
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
firestones
solace
is
a
nice
little
beer
the
ability
to
showcase
more
then
the
banana
profile
really
made
this
one
worth
returning
to
sip
after
sip
yet
another
drinkable
brew

note
drinkable
and
quenching
maybe
a

on
the

a
nice

overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
very
drinkable
but
a
bit
too
sweet
t
and
heres
where
it
goes
wrong
for
me
starts
with
wheatyhef
taste
and
then
goes
to
a
creamy
finish
with
some
orange
honey
and
spice
the
problem
is
that
its
way
overcarbonated
the
flavors
are
subtle
and
it
feels
like
this
beer
would
have
a
lot
to
offer
if
the
carbonation
didnt
blast
all
the
flavor
off
your
tongue
so
much
potential
but
not
that
great
in
the
end
in
the
upper
echelon
of
wheat
beers
with
sierra
nevada
kellerweisse
and
bells
oberon
a
spicy
yeasty
brew
with
soft
complimenting
fruitiness
and
slight
hops
for
balance
thank
you
firestone
for
showing
the
public
that
wheat
beers
can
be
interesting
i
will
definitely
return
to
this
during
the
hotter
months
carbonation
produces
a
light
tingle
when
first
sipped
but
isnt
really
present
otherwise
highly
drinkable
beer
as
the
finish
is
crisped
by
the
hops
that
are
there
well
balanced
tasty
wheat
beer
why
just
a
summer
seasonal
the
brewer
surely
knows
this
rivals
many
of
the
well
known
wheat
ales
firestone
raises
the
bar
for
wheat
ales
everywhere
drinkprobably
couldnt
have
much
of
this

good
a
nice

me
as
being
a
good

to
craft

with
yellow
highlights
that
had
a
thin

and
left
a
little

sticking
to

the
aroma
really
had
a
big
wheat
character
with
banana
clove
spice
slight
citrus
and
bready
malty
notes
upfront
on
the
palate
the
maltiness
stike

that
did
mesh
quite
well
with
the
banana

clove
spice
flavors
but
also
had
slight
citrus
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
slight
citric

bready
grainy

finish
it

not
great

was

tasty

even
at

great
summer
beer
hot
weather
is
perfect
for
this
beer
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
and
to
be
honest
didnt
know
this
was
one
when
i
bought
it
really
like
the
flavor
of
this
beer
as
its
got
a
distinct
flavor
that
i
dont
find
in
any
other
weizens
around
at
6
its
pretty
worthy
and
very
drinkable
at
that
has
become
a
regular
pick
up
and
turned
me
around
on
good
wheat
beer
firestone
i
always
want
to
like
all
there
beers
cause
there
brewery
is
30
minutes
from
my
house
this
one
just
wasnt
what
they
can
do
advice
is
if
this
is
you
first
firestone
try
the
double
barrel
its
a
much
better
beer
d
this
is
probably
the
most
flavorful
american
wheat
ive
had
flavors
are
awesome
thirst
quenching
a
few
of
these
would
be
great
with
fish
or

very
drinkable
highly
recommended
cheers
d
one
of
the
better
wheats
ive
had
so
far
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
very
unimposing
beer
not
really
a
good
conversation
starter
but
good
enough
in
and
of
itself
easy
to
come
back
to
d
this
is
a
great
refreshing
summer
beer
not
one
that
i
would
drink
everyday
but
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
success
firestone
walker
has
created
an
american
wheat
ale
thats
worth
a
damn
and
worth
at
least
a
sixpack
purchase
for
the
summer
above
average
drinkability
its
not
my
favorite
for
sure
but
i
might
not
mind
drinking
these
on
a
hot
day
but
thats
about
it
flavor
carries
forward
the
wheat
influence
and
is
somewhat
sweet
of
lemon
particularly
given
the
light
carbonation
which
seems
at
odds
to
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
offers
a
smooth
feel
and
finish
with
a
nice
touch
of
spice
on
the
close
and
a
long
citric
finish
d
goes
down
very
easy
and
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
session
however
im
not
sure
id
really
want
more
than
one
its
just
not
an
interesting
beer
glad
i
just
got
a
single
of
this
t
nice
creamy
smooth
body
with
a
little
bite
of
carbonation
underneath
flavor
of
mostly
spices
that
slowly
rolls
into
a
long
earthygrainy
finish
very
drinkable
beer
i
am
quite
impressed
with
it
the
body
is
smooth
crisp
and
wellrounded
drinkability
was
very
nice
it
went
down
easily
and
left
me
wanting
another
one
another
fine
brew
from
a
fine
brewery
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
an
hazy
golden
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
the
smell
of
yeast
and
mild
hops
were
evident
in
the
aroma
the
taste
had
a
pleasant
flavor
of
fruits
and
spice
although
even
with
the
pleasant
flavor
it
was
just
a
little
on
the
weak
side
of
flavor
but
overal
it
would
be
a
great
summer
sipper
d
lack
of
taste
or
complexity
definitely
makes
this
less
drinkable
but
its
light
and
refreshing
if
anything
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
offering
as
im
a
fan
of
most
other
fw
beers
the
whole
beer
just
seems
muddy
and
confused
not
what
i
expect
from
fwb
but
i
guess
they
need
a
patio
wheat
beer
to
compete
in
that
growing
and
lucrative
market
that
being
said
this
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
though
it
verges
on
the
wit
side
with
some
cloves
and
banana
notes
in
the
nose
and
finish
very
drinkable
though
a
little
thin
this
is
patio
fodder
and
worth
picking
up
for
that
reason
overall
this
beer
needs
the
yeast
without
swirl
and
pour
at
the
end
it
would
get
a
much
lower
grade
from
me
i
am
shocked
they
dont
tell
you
to
pour
this
like
a
german
hefe
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
good
summertime
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
defiantly
a
good
summer
bbq
beer
will
seek
out
again
d
out
of
this
world
instantly
a
summer
bbq
must
have
imo
firestone
walker
deserves
credit
for
not
brewing
yet
another
bland
american
pale
wheat
ale
that
would
bore
the
palate
of
most
craft
beer
lover
to
tears
solace
is
an
outstanding
summertime
quaffer
i
find
some
solace
in
the
fact
that
its
available
online
too
bad
shipping
is
ridiculously
expensive
light
golden
fairly
clear
body
chill

one
finger
white
head
medium

with
some

is
pretty
spicy
coriander
with
some
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
more
like
a
wit
than
a
apwa
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the
style
may
be
attributable
to
the
yeast
a
bit
funky
mouthfeel
is
medium
minimal
effervescence
pretty
drinkable
but
once
again
too
sweet
for
the
style
my
least
favorite
firestone
walker
beer
to
date
drinkability
i
guess
if
i
was
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
might
be
better
but
im
just
not
feeling
this
beer
kind
of
an
oxidized
malty
flavor
and
sweet
wheat
somewhat
creamy
with
too
heavy
of
an
alcohol
presence
for
a
summer
brew
almost
gets
cloying
but
a
little
hop
bite
on
the
end
keeps
it
from
being
so
undercarbonated
for
sure
as
not
even
a
swirl
can
not
get
any
bubbles
to
rise
to
the
top
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
my
first
fw
brew
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
but
this
bottle
was
a
bit
disappointing
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
not
my
favorite
wheat
beer
but
definitely
one
i
will
have
again
d
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
and
i
liked
the
mix
of
styles
will
pick
up
more
of
this
while
it
is
in
season
had
on
tap
at
lucky
baldwins
in
pasadena
ca
quite
cloudy
medium
maize
colour
about
a
finger
of
whitish
head
that
disippated
very
quickly
smells
like
a
wheat
beer
tastes
citruisy
with
bready
malts
reminds
me
a
lot
of
new
belgium
sunshine
wheat
or
boulevard
unfiltered
wheat
a
tiny
bit
of
spiciness
a
smidge
of
cloves
absolutely
no
hint
of
bananas
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
refreshing
very
drinkable
decent
wheat
beer
almost
approaching
a
saison
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
pours
with
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
generous
white
head
at
first
that
dissipates
to
not
much
soon
thereafter

is
very
faint
with
some
lemonorange

with
a

light
on

finish

store
oddly

and
boring
for

i
dont

this
one
was
a
very
good

for
their
new
sixpack
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light

the
flavor
is

im
not
a
big
fan
of
summer
beers
and
i
imagine
that
was
what
they
were
shooting
for
here
but
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer

on

for
another
the
way
some
other
summer
session
beers
might
on
a
nice
but
its
not
very
complex
and
is
really
more
like
an
american
wheat
beer
than
a

i

this

odell
might
be
the
most
consistent
brewery
in
co
the
smell
is
wonderful
but
otherwise
average
take
my
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
due
to
my
inexperience
please
excuse
my
brevity
this
beer
is
just
average
for
me
ive
had
better
in
the
style
and
ive
had
worse
still
a
decent
brew
my
favorite
wheat
beer
by
far
it
is
the
perfect
drink
for
the
summer
time
with
a
nice
orange
as
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
wheat
beer
does
some
weird
shit
to
my
palate
but
this
one
doesnt
gross
me
out
therefore
it
is
the
best
wheat
beer
ever
this
seemed
an
average
beer
to
me
nothing
special
but
still
quite
drinkable
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
hazy
dark
orangebrown
coloring
with
a
filmy
bubbly
white
head
nose
of
toasted
grains
subtle
citrus
notes
of
tangerine
and
hints
of
caramel
flavors
are
citrus
and
candy
sweet
forward
with
a
toasted
grain
backbone
highlights
of
tangerine
throughout
light
effervesced
body
with
a
citrusy
and
grainy
aftertaste
smooth
light
crisp
finish
im
just
not
a
wheat
beer
guy
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
odell
can
pretty
much
do
no
wrong
as
far
as
im
concerned
and
they
make
this
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
is
one
of
their
most
popular
beers
and
i
can
see
why
overall
3
83
if
someone
shows
up
to
your
house
with
a
six
pack
of
easy
street
you
know
you
have
a
buddy
for
life
this
personpersons
knows
beer
and
you
should
be
grateful
for
that
this
is
a
good
wheat
beer
impressive
even
and
when
a
beer
makes
you
say

for

from

could
tell
it
was
a

from
the

didnt
realize
it
was
a
wheat
variant
at
first
although
subconsciously
i
knew
it
from
the
name
a
little
thinner
than
i
would
expect
from
either
a
pale
ale
or
a
wheat
ale
still
a
good
drinkable
beer
wish
i
could
say
more
but
wasnt
really
prepared
to
take
notes
or
inclined
to
think
about
it
really
hard
and
then
as
i
said
straight
from
the
bottle
so
not
much
for
looks
or
aroma
would
like
to
try
again
some
time
so
i
can
update
my
review
one
of
those
beers
that
you
have
to
get
your
hands
on
malty
soft
nose
with
a
generous
dose
fruit
and
hint
of
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
sweet

really
full
with
pleasant
mango
hops
and
a
clean
long

finish
three
floyds
staple
im
very
lucky
to
live
in
an
area
where
i
can
find
this
almost
anytime
i
want
if
only
i
could
say
the
same
for
its
cousin
zombie
dust
but
no
complaints
this
beer
is
amazing
in
its
own
right
the
staple
of
3
floyds
heaven
in
a
bottle
i
love
the

this

on

great
pine

lemony
hop
flavor
but
the
malt
bill
seemed
lacking
not
my
favorite
my
favorite
beer
smooth
taste
good
character
when
people
say
this
is
a
session
beer
they
mean
it
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
a
6
pack
of
this
and
as
much
as
i
wouldve
loved
to
save
it
and
enjoy
it
throughout
the
weekend
i
have
to
admit
i
blew
through
all
six
in
an
evening
its
delicious
amazing
and
very
easy
to
drink
id
be
buying
this
constantly
if
it
were
readily
available
awesome
session
beer
wish
i
could
get
this
more
often
o
enjoyable
taste
varied
week
to
week
drink
fresh
this
is
a
crisp
wheat
beer
that
is
very
heavy
on
the
lemony
hops
its
quite
refreshing
and
would
have
better
served
me
on
a
hot
summer
day
perfect
head
retention
hence
5
stars
for
look
very
refreshing
great
beer
to
have
around
for
any
occasion
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
they
have
set
the
bar
very
high
in
my
opinion
none
have
come
close
since
the
first
taste
2
years
ago
this
is
some
pretty
good
beer
extremely
refreshing
summer
beer
wonderful
amarillo
hop
aroma
slightly
aggressive
bittering
for
the
style
very
enjoyable

beer

by

with
the
amarillo
hops
tastes
more
of
a
pale
than
wheat
that
is
good
for
hop
heads
lite
flavor
at
times
is
overrated
around
here
which
is
a
shame
it
gets
built
up
to
be
just
something
its
not
its
not
earth
shattering
but
it
is
a
damn
good
beer
like
a
sweet
pale
ale
different
and
good
not
great
for
my
palate
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
very
good
seems
more
of
a
wheat
pale
ale
rather
than
a
pale
wheat
ale
if
that
makes
any
sense
at
all
an
instant
favorite
tried
and
true
a
reliable
brew
one
of
the
best
session
beers
i
have
ever
had
great
taste
a
pleasent
earthy
wheat
taste
just
right
amount
snap
at
the
end
from
the
hops
a
very
well
ballanced
beer
i
love
this
brew
sampled
on
tap
and
12oz
bottles
far
to
many
times
than
i
want
to
admit
i
tried
this
recently
in
a
pint
glass
that
was
poured
fresh
from
a
tap
for
some
reason
it
was
significantly
better
than
what
i
tried
from
bottles
previously
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
perfect
nuff
said
you
cant
find
another
beer
at
this
level
in
this
style
i
have
had
a
lot
of
different
beers
and
none
really
get
close
to
the
quality
of
this
beer
makes
sense
why
it
is
hard
to
find
i
love
this
beer
picked
it
up
expecting
it
to
taste
like
most
wheat
beers
lacking
any
real
sustenance
i
could
not
have
been
more
wrong
what
a
refreshing
beer
for
me
but
also
for
the
industry
that
i
think
is
lacking
in
experimental
wheat
brews
the
amarillo
hops
are
very
apparent
and
the
after
taste
proves
it
one
of
my
regular
favorites
but
hard
to
come
by
unless
you
really
look
or
stop
by
3
floyds
taste

with
a
hoppy
finish
perfect
amber
fluffy
white

ripe
orangelime
zest
fruity
pebbles
cut
grass
over
the
top
citrus
hop
subdued
body
and
great
finish
overall
does
it
live
up
to
the
hype
im
not
sure
this
is
an
amazing
beer
but
lagunitas
really
gives
them
a
run
for
the
money
with
their
sumpin
line
nonetheless
a
very
good
brew
that
every
beer
geek
needs
to
try
a
really
interesting
beer
for
me
as
it
is
not
what
i
would
consider
a
standard
wheat
beer
it
has
the
same
notes
as
a
wheat
as
well
as
a
beautiful
hoppy
punch
at
the
end
to
ramp
up
the
flavor
profile
really
nice
and
deliciously
drinkable
12

overall
an

beer
cant
say
ive
had
any
other
american
pale
wheats
but
gumballhead
takes
the
cake
i
was
so
excited
to
try
this
based
on
my
inability
to
obtain
this
locally
and
the
reviews
on
ba
it
was
my
favorite
hoppy
wheat
but
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
imho
outstanding
the
hops
make
this
beer
delicious
with
an
irresistible
aroma
and
a
sweet
psychedelic
look
and
feel
ive
tried
numerous
wheats

favorite
wheat
beer
because
it
is
not
your
typical

beer
excellent
smells
of
fruit
and
wheat
all
at

what
an
eye
opener
the
appearance
is
a
very
clear
pale
orangeyellow
color
especially
midswallow
and
after
swallowing
the
wheat
seems
to
have
thinned
the
beer
and
added
weird
astringent
tastes
rather
than
being
used
to
build
body
and
soft
banana
esters
i
would
like
to
see
this
one
unfiltered
and
more
like
a
hopped

but
its
good
news
for
everyone
that
they
did
ive
always
been
interested

how
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
had
such
a
high
score
on
a
site
where
dipas
and
ba
stouts
rule
the
roost
and
now
i
know
why
its
simply
a
great
beer
this
was
my
first
three
floyds
beer
and
id
love
to
try
more
thank
you
so
much
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this

5had
the
second
of
the
two
gumballhead
that
i
was
able
to
get
pours
a
nice
yellowish
orange
with
an
ok
head
the
smell
is
phenomenal
im
a
sucker
for
a
sweet
hoppy
smell
that
is
headed
up
with
an
abundance
of
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
very
good
as
well
the
citrus
gets
you
up
front
followed
by
a
relatively
smooth
hoppy
finish
the
only
negative
to
say
is
that
it
doesnt
go
far
enough
with
the
citrus
and
hops
no
doubt
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
get
again
though

favorite
beers
it
is
very
hard
to
find
in
the
indianapolis
area
but
when
i
do
find
it
i
buy
it
highly
recommended
as
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
if
you
offer
it
to
your
friends
they
will
really
appreciate
it

this
is
truly
an
exceptional
wheat
its
as
if
fff
took
a
wheat
and
pounded
it
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
draw
out
the
basic
lemonwheat
flavors

but
what
makes
this
beer
so
good
is
that
they
are
late
addition
hops
this
is
not

beer
and
the
majority
of
the
hop

this
is
in

top
3
favorite
beers
wheat
beer
helped
me
get
into
craft
beer
and
this
a
perfect
breakaway
you
get
the
wheat
beer
name
i
used
to
love
plus
the
hops
and
flavors
lacking
in
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
its
more
like
a
wheat
ipa
if
you
can

i
definitely
recommend
getting
a
case
of
it
you

o
a
highly
soughtafter
brew
from
3
floyds
is
it
completely
worth
the
mythological
hype
maybe
not
but
this
is
a
solid
wheat
beer
honestly
i
have
not
had
the
style
in
quite
a
while
but
this
is
probably
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
had
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
very
good
clarity
and
decent
head
retention
aroma
of
wheat
citrus
and
mild
herbal
qualities
in
the
taste
moderate
wheat
and
a
good
dose
of
hops
hop
flavors
of
citrus
tropical
fruit
mango
pineapple
and
mild
pine
still
the
hops
are
in
the
background
and
dont
steal
the
show
more
wheat
with
a
grainy
flavor
and
a
touch
of
lemon
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
bodied
overall
a
really
nice
pale
wheat
refreshing
and
enough
hops
to
keep
it
interesting
o
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
the
aromas
and
flavor
are
refreshing
i
love
the
combination
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruits
and
it
finishes
with
enough
bitterness
to
keep
me
wanting
another
drink
o
its
a
good
beer
but
for
me
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
reveal
fff
gumballhead
oof
i
just
had
this
a
couple
of
days
ago
and
didnt
recognize
it
at
all
also
whiffed
on
the
amarillo
once
again
this
bif
does
its
job
and
makes
me
reassess
what
i
thought
would
be
an
instantly
recognizeable
beer
verdict
really
fine
wheat
ale
from
three
floyds
great
for
all
occasions
and
a
perfect
session
or
table
beer
this
is
a
great
starter
beer
for
someone
just
getting
into
craft
overall
the
quintessential
lawnmower
beer
light
and
flavorful
awesome
i
wish
i
could
have
this
in
my
fridge
every
day
during
the
summer
o
a
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
way
too
fast
tastes
more
like
a
pale
ale
to
me
o
its
great
its
that
simple
this
one
might
become
a
regular
in
the
fridge
again
o
really
surprised
me
not
really
a
wheat
beer
fan
or
fruit
beer
fan
but
this
won
me
over
it
was
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
each
swig
left
me
wanting
more
the
wheat
was
in
the
background
the
fruit
and
hops
balanced
well
and
it
just
clicked
for
this
to
be
a
wheat
beer
it
really
tastes
like
a
pale
ale
to
me
i
like
the
hoppiness
and
this
is
a
clean
refreshing
beer
pours
a
golden
amber
with
little
head
looks
like
a
beer
in
a
commercial
thats
not
a
bad
thing
smells
of
citrus
and
hops
not
overpowering
excellent
has
a
little
bit
of
hop
bite
up
front
with
the
wheat
coming
in
later
but
coming
in
really
strong
a
hint
of
something
citrusy
grapefruit
maybe
at
less
than
5
abv
this
is
one
you
can
sip
all
day
i
just
might
pours
a
golden
orangegold
color
with
a
great
one
finger
off
white
head
good
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
looks
much
more
substantial
than
most
beers
in
the
style
the
nose
is
unsurpassed
by
any
beer
ive
tried
in
the
style
it
smells
like
an
ipa
thats
how
good
it
is
pineapple
mango
and
other
fruits
are
in
the
front
here
along
with
hops
by
far
the
best
in
style
ive
ever
smelled
taste
follows
suit
fairly
light
but
great
fruit
hops
and
floral
flavors
some
grass
as
well
as
it
warms
feel
is
light
with
incredible
carbonationaftertaste
overall
theres
a
reason
this
beer
leads
its
style
its
incredible
a
great
session
brew
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
cheers
great
anytime
beer
light
yellow
in
color
hoppy
smell
on
pour
citrus
taste
small
head
disapates
rather
quickly
had
it
new
years
eve
but
would
definitely
drink
anytime
three
floyds
hit
the
mark
again
for
me
the
store
where
i
usually
buy
my
growlers
sells
out
of
this
very
fast
and
i
was
lucky
to
get
some
this
time
cant
wait
to
have
some
again
real
soon
overall
try
this
beer
its
great
for
drinking
i
would
love
to
have
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
trade
pretty
much
anything
for
this
beer
overall
solid
beer
here
i
drank
this
beer
with
an
egg
sandwich
for
breakfast
and
it
was
a
really
good
pairing
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
gumballhead
is
a
fantastic
beer
while
it
is
not
one
i
reach
for
often
when
it
is
available
to
me
i
also
enjoy
it
when
i
do
great
warm
weather
beer
but
then
again
i
would
not
be
opposed
to
enjoying
a
few
in
the
comfort
of
my
home
while
watching
the
snow
fly
very
drinkable
easy
to
enjoy
had
this
beer
last
night
thanks
alec
for
dropping
this
one
off
at
my
house
this
beer
pours
a
ligh
yellow
color
with
a
slight
haze
to
it
and
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
light
lemony
with
a
little
wheat
malt
there
too
i
really
like
the
flavor
there
is
the
lemony
tang
to
it
and
its
super
light
and
refreshing
overall
a
great
beer
overall
this
beer
has
some
sentimental
value
for
me
i
first
drank
it
when
i
really
shouldnt
have
d
my
taste
generally
gravitates
towards
more
acidichop
centric
brews
but
this
is
a
great
balance
of
easy
drinking
while
having
a
distinct
hop
flavor
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
majority
of
drinkers
overall
very
refreshing
and
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
ive
encountered
the
wheat
plays
a
nice
backing
and
rounding
role
and
allows
other
flavors
to
play
through
and
shine
also
hops
make
it
way
better
this
beer
does
not
follow
suit
it
goes
big
for
the
style
very
unique
bitter
yet
drinkable
and
just
sweet
enough
to
really
savor
one
of
my
goto
favorites
pours
pale
orange
with
a
small
head
nose
is
rainbow
bubblegum
soft
orange
and
grapefruit
meat
some
light
spices
mouth
is
lightly
sweet
banana
bitter
hops
at
the
finish
with
some
citrus
rind
end
of
finish
is
sort
of
discordant
an
interesting
take
on
a
wheat
beer
one
of
the
more
brightly
hopped
ones
ive
had
and
well
done
that
being
said
i
cant
see
this
having
a
regular
place
among
beers
i
would
like
to
drink
regularly
as
its
kind
of
too
sweet
for
a
pale
ale
and
too
brightly
hopped
for
a
wheat
beer
gumballhead
pours
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
about
34
finger
head
the
smell
is
a
pure
fruity
hoppy
waft
on
the
nose
you
get
a
light
crisp
fruit
taste
with
just
enough
bitterness
the
balance
between
flavors
and
bitterness
is
the
highlight
of
this
brew
in
my
opinion
overall
a
delicious
brew
for
any
season
but
especially
during
those
hot
summer
days
the
downfall
of
this
beer
is
the
hype
vs
availability
although
its
a
great
beer
having
to
call
my
local
liqour
store
to
check
availabilty
and
then
being
laugh
at
doesnt
make
me
want
to
drink
it
as
much
as
i
want
to
if
you
see
it
grab
it
and
buy
it
this
is
an
allaround
solid
beer
its
ridiculously
refreshing
clean
and
inoffensive
the
fruitiness
is
really
interesting
and
overall
this
is
very
drinkable
now
if
i
could
only
get
more
of
this
serving
type
bottle
got
this
as
part
of
a
beer
trade
recently
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
hype
around
it
and
understandably
so
from
the
time
this
showed
up
in
the
mail
i
was
hyped
on
the
label
when
i
opened
the
bottle
for
pouring
it
radiated
an
amazing
hoppy
tropical
scent
poured
in
a
standard
pint
glass
crystal
clear
yellow
golden
color
with
frothy
white
head
smell
lots
of
citrus
mango
and
pineapple
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
coming
through
taste
is
mild
light
tropical
fruits
as
mentioned
above
and
some
citrus
hops
after
taste
has
a
touch
of
biter
hops
i
could
drink
these
all
day
i
hate
not
being
able
to
drink
this
beer
regularly
simple
yet
tasty
done
right
and
super
sessionable
maybe
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
but
still
hoppy
enough
to
satisfy
i
wish
i
could
get
this
cause
it
would
be
in
my
fridge
more
often
than
not
prolly
my
favorite
american
pale
wheat
to
date
an
excellent
wheat
beer
that
uses
loads
of
hops
to
extenuate
the
wheat
and
fruity
yeast
has
a
lemon
zest
kick
that
is
well
placed
and
goes
great
with
the
hop
profile
this
may
indeed
be
king
of
the
wheat
beers
no
wonder
its
always
so
hard
to
find
pretty
much
a
nice
golden
wheat
color
with
a
poor
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
color
is
wonderful
though
like
a
rich
golden
yellow
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
citrusy
a
nice
balanced
burst
of
hops
not
to
much
bitter
hoppiness
up
front
with
great
citrus
and
grapefruit
quality
following
in
the
wake
a
very
clear
presence
of
wheat
with
its
distinct
cracker
like
flavor
and
mouthfeel
fluffy
mouthfeel
light
but
some
of
that
resin
hop
mouthfeel
quality
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
id
drink
it
all
the
time
o
decent
but
i
was
expecting
more
probably
a
style
i
need
to
try
more
of
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
what
it
should
be
it
is
very
drinkable
and
could
be
a
great
sunday
beer
or
something
to
share
with
the
nonnerdy
beer
drinkers
definitely
growing
on
me
as
i
drink
it
i
have
never
played
with
the
scores
as
much
as
i
have
with
this
beer
but
recommend
everyone
should
try
id
say
i
could
use
some
more
of
this
gumballhead
overall
wow
a
wheat
beer
that
manages
to
be
both
hoppy
and
balanced
and
unlike
lagunitas
little
sumpin
sumpin
which
is
really
more
of
an
ipa
i
can
actually
tell
this
is
a
wheat
beer
if
this
was
available
in
minnesota
this
would
be
a
musthave
lawnmower
beer
ever
summer
by
far
the
best
american
wheat
i
have
had
overall
impression
i
can
see
why
the
chicago
guys
get
fussy
about
this
critter
o
i
love
amarillo
hops
in
my
home
brewing
and
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
i
had
always
figured
on
this
beer
being
a
wheat
ipa
rather
it
is
more
of
an
apa
with
a
thick
body
enjoyable
overall
the
combination
in
this
brew
is
great
i
love
the
whole
complex
of
the
ingredients
cheers
overall
this
beer
shows
the
big
differences
between
american
and
european
beers
i
had
some
european
beers
before
this
one
and
its
hard
to
tell
because
they
are
basically
the
same
style
hops
are
accented
much
more
then
the
yeast
in
the
europeans
easy
to
see
why
this
is
the
one
of
the
regular
beers
by
three
floyds
easily
drinkable
which
gives
it
an
overall
commercial
appeal
i
take
it
that
it
his
doesnt
sit
well
with
the
subtle
banana
undertones
very
very
subtle
this
is
properly
hopped
as
in
a
lot
like
all
there
other
beers
brisk
the
adjunct
is
like
a
charm
and
american
and
adjunct
is
like
a
hex
they
do
it
great
wonderful
look
for
a
session
although
sort
of
watery
in
persona
still
very
accessible
probably
the
most
being
a
three
floyds
when
it
comes
to
hop
character
golden
clear
small
head
brisk
hop
dry
mild
floral
and
a
hint
of
yeast
starches
in
the
back
note
which
im
sure
may
over
develop
over
time
i
would
lavender
zucchini
bread
but
um
beer
o
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
and
one
i
would
go
to
consistently
in
the
summer
if
i
had
the
option
on
draft
appears
light
golden
with
half
finger
of
head
appears
very
carbonated
but
dies
quickly
smells
of
fresh
grass
and
pines
complimemted
by
amazing
floral
tastes
the
hops
are
not
overbearing
in
the
least
very
smooth
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
very
impressive
o
smells
good
but
tastes
amazing
drinkability
is
off
the
scale
as
well
king
of
the
pale
wheats
i
think
lil
sumpin
sumpin
comes
close
but
yet
so
far
i
tried
to
grade
this
one
by
style
and
i
have
never
had
better
hence
the
5s
wish
this
were
available
in
my
area
incredible
beer
overall
for
a
pale
ale
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
very
sessionable
and
a
very
easy
drinker
anytime
of
the
day
or
night
an
incredibly
easy
drinking
delicious
lowabv
pale
wheat
with
a
ton
of
character
i
cant
think
of
a
better
pale
wheat
ale
it
isnt
dreadnaught
panzer
alpha
king
or
zombie
dust
it
is
lighter
yet
still
packs
such
a
wonderful
hop
profile
and
presence
that
i
just
cant
say
enough
about
what
this
beer
does
i
want
to
knock
it
for
something
but
damn
just
cant
do
more
or
less
as
promised
this
beer
smells
like
ballast
points
sculpin
ipa
but
embarks
upon
its
own
evolutionary
path
when
it
comes
to
flavor
it
uses
each
of
its
marquee
ingredients
to
full
effect
wringing
floral
aromatics
from
the
amarillo
hops
and
soft
bread
from
the
wheat
it
is
compelling
and
palatefriendly
but
like
the
most
interesting
west
coast
ipas
does
not
play
well
with
most
other
flavors
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
more
than
rich
enough
for
the
style
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
a
very
sessionable
and
tasty
beer
overall
very
nice
for
the
style
but
dont
make
the
mistake
we
made
while
trying
fff
brews
drink
this
before
zombie
dust
but
i
do
highly
recommend
this
anyways
this
was
my
first
review
o
this
brew
lived
up
to
all
of
the
hype
another
great
one
from
three
floyds
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
some
of
their
other
brews
overall
this
beer
might
as
well
be
a
pale
ale
cause
the
wheat
beer
qualities
are
minimal
and
are
only
detected
in
the
finish
most
importantly
though
ive
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
a
month
so
its
assy
and
not
as
fresh
as
it
should
be
for
a
wheat
low
abv
brew
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
have
had
this
several
times
in
the
past
but
first
time
sitting
down
for
a
review
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
not
a
huge
head
but
it
sticks
around
nicely
a
little
bit
of
floral
hops
in
the
scent
but
mostly
grassy
and
earthy
notes
flavor
is
right
there
with
the
nose
a
bit
of
sharp
bitterness
up
front
followed
quickly
by
smooth
bready
earthy
and
grassy
flavors
nice
smooth
and
balanced
finish
fairly
light
body
without
a
ton
of
carbonation
overall
very
refreshing
and
a
really
tasty
brew
o
very
good
wheat
beer
that
is
definatly
sesssionable
the
only
downfall
is
it
leaves
a
soapy
taste
in
my
mouth
give
me
oberon
or
live
oak
hefe
for
that
matter
any
day
i
dont
know
if
i
keep
getting
old
bottles
but
this
is
nothing
close
to
the
better
wheat
beers
out
there
let
alone
the
far
superior
hefes
overall
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
pale
wheat
ales
for
sure
thanks
so
much
arkansastroy
for
this
as
an
extra
in
our
recent
trade
very
grateful
for
the
chance
to
have
tried
this
beer
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
sessionable
beer
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
more
often
im
sure
it
would
replace
oberon
as
my
summer
session
brew
o
im
enjoying
this
one
quite
a
bit
right
now
this
is
a
damn
good
tasting
beer
thats
lighter
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
worth
getting
your
hands
on
to
try
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
pretty
smooth
and
easy
drinking
overall
its
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
out
there
no
doubt
definitely
some
good
hoppiness
in
this
one
o
overall
a
hoppy
slightly
intense
yet
utterly
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
ale
i
could
suck
down
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
for
sure
not
blown
away
but
very
impressed
at
the
same
time
o
another
please
what
a
great
beer
and
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
a
fresh
bottle
thanks
again
deuane
the
aroma
gets
you
hooked
then
you
take
that
first
sip
and
youre
hooked
even
more
im
guessing
this
stuff
is
dryhopped
its
certainly
got
a
ton
of
sweet
citrus
in
the
nose
backed
up
with
wheat
and
yeast
a
very
tasty
beer
thats
much
hoppier
than
you
typically
see
from
the
style
a
minor
complaint
is
that
the
hops
somewhat
overpower
the
wheat
but
like
i
said
tasty
stuff
abundant
carbonation
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
accentuate
the
moderate
level
of
bitterness
the
wheat
pitches
in
there
too
no
doubt
toss
in
the
light
malt
profile
and
crazy
tropical
fruit
flavor
combo
and
this
stuff
is
really
more
like
a
wheat
ipa
than
anything
an
easy
recommendation
for
this
unique
brew
thanks
todd
renegade
reps
overall
the
beer
is
good
the
people
who
made
it
put
a
lot
of
time
making
this
one
and
it
shows
i
honestly
would
enjoy
1
maybe
2
depending
on
the
weather
other
than
that
the
sweetness
and
the
zest
is
a
bit
much
for
the
lack
of
alcohol
clean
refreshing
after
one
but
i
stop
there
o
thank
allah
i
can
drink
this
ontap
on
a
regular
basis
the
only
thing
better
is
zombie
dust
both
are
perfection
od
was
lucky
enough
to
obtain
a
bottle
from
a
cool
dude
i
would
absolutely
love
to
have
this
beer
available
to
me
very
different
and
very
yummy
this
lived
up
to
expectations
for
me
really
begging
for
another
right
now
o
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
pale
ale
than
a
wheat
ale
but
it
is
certainly
well
made
and
i
like
it
thanks
casey
im
typically
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
ill
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
day
if
im
low
on
alpha
king
or
ambergeddon
o
great
pale
wheat
ale
i
am
thrilled
that
i
was
finally
able
to
try
three
floyds
i
look
forward
to
the
rest
i
have
been
able
to
get
in
trade
o
very
easy
drinking
beer
with
lots
of
great
flavor
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
would
buy
again
o
i
really
liked
it
excellent
summer
beer
that
will
satisfy
any
hop
head
overall
this
is
a
solid
easy
to
drink
beer
the
sweetness
of
the
wheat
is
well
balanced
with
the
slight
bitterness
and
citrus
notes
of
the
amarillo
hops
it
is
basically
a
wheat
pale
ale
wpa
i
mowed
the
lawn
earlier
this
morning
and
craved
this
beer
when
i
came
in
so
it
is
definitely
an
above
average
lawnmower
beer
o
probably
the
best
wheat
out
there
super
good
beer
one
of
the
best
things
about
living
in
indiana
o
a
delicious
and
extremely
drinkable
beer
everything
about
the
beer
is
mellow
and
soft
but
the
hop
flavors
are
big
enough
to
please
a
hop
head
it
might
be
a
little
bitter
for
the
style
but
i
enjoy
that
o
i
like
it
wellenough
as
a
pale
ale
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
full
sail
ipa
o
truly
wonderful
as
stated
before
now
one
of
my
favorites
and
cannot
wait
to
try
again
overall
im
glad
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
on
a
positive
note
i
really
enjoyed
the
hoppy
take
on
a
wheat
beer
and
also
the
unique
clean
clear
profile
my
personal
opinion
of
the
gumball
note
was
that
it
was
interesting
at
first
but
tasted
more
and
more
out
of
place
over
time
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
on
draught
but
its
likely
that
this
ones
just
not
for
me
please
try
though
to
see
what
you
think
about
it
o
this
isnt
even
close
to
any
other
american
wheat
this
is
a
fairly
watery
boring
style
with
no
hop
character
three
floyds
decided
it
didnt
have
to
be
and
made
this
great
beer
im
impressed
standard
hazy
golden
body
and
lemony
scent
with
a
noticeable
hoppy
character
flavor
followed
suite
this
one
fulfills
the
pale
in
pale
wheat
ale
nicely
i
definitely
puckered
when
i
sipped
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
the
label
is
dope
also
ofor
not
being
a
fan
of
wheat
beer
or
pale
ales
this
was
a
good
beer
with
nice
balance
its
not
a
great
finish
but
very
pleasant
otherwise
and
even
better
the
second
time
around
o
overall
i
am
a
hop
head
and
like
this
for
a
wheat
beer
its
definitely
what
i
would
choose
if
available
in
my
area
its
almost
a
wheat
ipa
if
you
ask
me
and
a
good
one
at
that
thumbs
up
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
yellow
straw
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
it
smells
hoppy
and
like
lemongrass
a
little
peppery
hop
smell
the
taste
is
great
a
nice
mouthfeel
of
lemon
and
hops
it
really
works
well
i
should
drink
this
one
more
often
its
hard
to
find
in
fort
wayne
and
its
a
little
maybe
overpriced
around
here
though
too
three
floyds
is
giving
midwest
brewing
one
heck
of
a
reputation
these
guys
are
fearless
much
like
their
art
work
for
their
beers
gumball
head
is
by
far
my
favorite
wheat
beer
the
appearance
is
a
clear
yellowgolden
color
with
nice
carbonation
that
provides
good
white
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
scent
is
a
wonderful
bouquet
spice
and
citrus
formed
by
the
amarillo
hops
the
taste
has
a
great
citrus
combo
of
lemongrapefruitapricot
and
touch
of
spice
that
i
cant
define
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
session
no
question
this
wheat
beer
could
be
a
pale
ale
easily
an
absolute
must
try
o
glad
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
try
this
one
its
clearly
a
classic
and
deserves
to
be
distributed
far
and
wide
as
to
give
all
american
craft
beer
lovers
a
chance
at
having
it
at
least
once
onot
much
of
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
is
a
very
good
one
seek
it
out
if
you
have
the
opportunity
overall
gumballhead
is
the
best
sessionstrength
pale
wheat
ale
that
ive
sampled
while
little
sumpin
sumpin
7
5
abv
is
more
flavourful
robust
and
aromatic
this
is
the
benchmark
low
alcohol
apwa
a
truly
remarkable
quaffer
that
i
could
drink
for
days
on
end
superb
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
superrefreshing
the
body
is
not
thick
or
sticky
and
while
it
is
not
watery
certainly
can
be
gulped
easily
the
carbonation
is
not
fizzy
but
definitely
helps
to
keep
this
beer
awesomely
drinkable
the
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
taste
does
not
become
drying
in
the
least
making
this
beer
as
tasty
as
it
is
thirstquenching
on
a
sidenote
it
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
jackie
os
golden
spice
hazy
golden
color
a
few
little
floaties
head
is
generous
but
quick
aromas
are
bright
lots
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
hints
of
pine
and
grapefruit
waft
in
and
out
orange
and
pineapple
dominate
flavor
is
a
god
reflection
similar
to
nose
lots
of
citrus
and
pineappple
fruit
flavors
finish
is
crisp
and
nicely
bitter
very
impressed
with
this
beer
wish
i
could
get
it
in
va
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
the
hop
character
is
very
pronounced
but
balances
well
with
the
malt
character
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
these
in
a
short
period
of
time
ill
have
to
trade
for
more
of
this
sometime
soon
i
have
to
say
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
its
strange
this
beer
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
its
so
smooth
and
easy
drinking
this
would
be
three
floyds
answer
to
coors
bud
miller
lite
etc
this
is
a
genuine
everyday
all
occasions
drinker
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
about
this
beer
that
hasnt
been
mentioned
already
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
hope
someday
soon
i
can
get
it
here
in
ohio
whenever
i
need
it
12
oz
bottle
with
cartoonish
graphics
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
decent
fluffy
white
head
it
smells
of
hops
this
beer
tastes
like
an
apa
the
wheat
flavors
are
minimal
this
beer
is
pretty
alright
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
taste
as
it
did
overall
nice
refreshing
wheat
big
citrus
o
very
light
in
taste
and
aroma
still
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
the
light
candy
taste
is
very
different
could
drink
a
6
pack
of
this
in
about
3045
minutes
on
a
hot
day
o
for
the
record
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
american
pale
wheat
ales
but
this
is
about
as
good
as
you
can
get
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
overall
i
drink
this
beer
almost
as
much
as
i
can
when
i
can
find
it
its
not
an
easy
one
to
locate
and
i
can
see
why
another
great
offering
from
fff
nice
smooth
taste
hints
again
of
a
medley
of
fruits
the
wheat
works
as
a
nice
counterbalance
good
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
quencher
very
well
done
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
an
efes
tulip
thin
white
head
with
low
retention
clear
oily
lacing
clear
body
strawgold
in
color
aroma
dominated
by
citrussy
hops
tangerine
lemon
lime
grapefruit
taste
is
a
lovely
blast
of
citrus
as
the
hops
dominate
the
body
is
soft
and
very
palatable
i
assume
by
the
addition
of
wheat
a
great
style
of
beer
and
along
with
sumpin
sumpin
a
awesome
version
if
the
style
o
nice
hoppy
twist
on
a
pale
wheat
ale
very
light
refreshing
and
drinkable
pours
a
nice
yelloworange
with
a
good
head
excellent
citrus
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
nice
grapefruit
smell
not
terribly
bitter
and
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
day
nice
hop
balance
and
finishes
very
smooth
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
i
would
not
actually
describe
this
as
a
wheat
ale
but
since
i
am
relatively
new
to
beer
tasting
perhaps
i
just
dont
understand
the
style
as
well
i
would
love
to
have
this
in
my
refrigerator
yearround
as
it
could
easily
be
a
goto
standard
beer
without
breaking
down
every
detail
of
this
beer
i
wanted
to
rate
it
it
has
plenty
of
people
putting
down
any
little
particular
they
can
identify
my
local
beer
stores
distributor
no
longer
travles
to
our
area
and
the
new
one
dosent
carry
fff
and
it
breaks
my
heart
so
i
just
wanted
to
memorialize
this
delicious
beer
that
there
is
never
a
bad
time
for
and
i
cant
get
enough
of
overall
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
and
cant
wait
to
get
more
of
it
so
again
this
is
a
great
great
beer
with
tremendous
personality
if
i
were
to
mix
a
six
pack
as
a
gift
for
a
visiting
german
friend
there
would
be
a
12oz
bottle
of
gumballhead
no
doubt
about
it
pours
a
suprisingly
clean
golden
amber
color
nice
plume
of
white
froth
decent
lacing
first
whiff
is
a
remarkable
rush
of
fruit
from
pineapple
to
mango
to
grapefruit
to
peach
light
funky
tartness
from
the
wheat
and
a
light
whiff
of
simple
syrup
like
sweetness
taste
brings
the
fruit
to
the
front
but
not
as
aggressive
as
the
scent
dictates
and
the
tart
and
lightly
funky
wheat
and
yeast
come
into
play
finishes
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
akin
to
a
teaspoon
full
of
powdered
sugar
medium
bodied
surprisingly
creamy
and
smooth
a
very
nice
beer
with
a
lot
of
positives
a
little
more
kick
of
fruity
hop
flavor
and
i
would
be
dying
for
more
o
drinkable
delicious
and
not
overpowering
id
have
it
again
if
i
could
ever
find
it
o
this
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
i
mean
it
feels
like
you
could
crush
a
vat
of
this
thing
thirst
quenching
fruity
flavors
beautiful
hop
contrast
and
a
mouth
that
rivals
the
ambrosia
of
the
gods
such
a
treat
to
have
a
fresh
offering
of
this
beer
and
to
be
able
to
drink
it
on
a
hot
southern
california
day
this
beer
is
on
the
session
ale
dream
team
a
starter
in
any
lineup
seek
this
out
its
very
well
worth
it
on
second
thought
get
at
least
two
o
very
highly
sessionable
delicious
pale
wheat
ale
i
dont
see
many
trumping
this
great
balance
and
highquality
flavors
compose
this
wonderful
brew
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
or
a
growler
had
several
bottles
of
this
and
was
definitely
let
down
a
bit
would
love
to
try
it
on
draft
to
see
if
it
can
live
up
to
the
hype
overall
a
great
summer
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
i
dontknow
if
it
fits
the
style
of
pale
wheat
ale
but
nice
beer
all
together
i
want
more
o
much
hyped
and
not
dissapointed
this
beer
wouldnt
be
in
my
top
10
however
it
is
a
real
bright
star
in
a
usually
forgetable
style
of
beer
othis
is
a
clean
crisp
wheat
beer
it
could
also
serve
as
a
hop
fix
when
i
need
it
i
wish
this
was
available
to
me
thanks
again
bay01
o
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
o
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
this
style
but
i
have
to
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
nuanced
for
a
wheat
beer
personally
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
from
the
smell
i
expected
more
citrus
notes
nevertheless
if
i
lived
in
indiana
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
during
the
summer
months
a
very
good
beer
im
grateful
to
have
tried
it
o
this
beer
isnt
quite
what
i
expected
at
all
but
it
was
a
great
surprise
and
i
can
see
why
people
go
crazy
over
it
its
a
fantastic
summer
beer
that
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
o
another
great
one
from
fff
these
guys
have
to
be
considered
one
of
the
best
american
breweries
great
job
d
very
drinkable
with
an
assertive
hop
character
bravo
on
breathing
some
life
into
a
simple
style
o
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
be
perfect
at
a
bbq
or
on
the
lake
i
like
this
beer
and
glad
i
tried
it
with
that
said
when
im
back
in
three
floyds
territory
ill
probably
reach
for
something
else
o
have
had
plenty
of
times
on
draft
and
bottled
and
while
its
certainly
a
good
brew
especially
for
a
hoppy
wheat
i
think
this
beer
gets
hyped
up
a
bit
too
much
certainly
a
refreshing
brew
for
summer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
fff
then
that
fine
flavor
a
well
balanced
wheat
with
a
great
hop
kick
this
is
probably
a
wheat
that
would
scare
off
a
blue
moon
drinker
but
the
strong
citrus
flavor
makes
an
orange
unnecessary
the
complex
flavors
and
aromas
make
this
beer
a
must
for
anyone
who
enjoys
good
beers
a
very
tasty
wheat
pale
ale
worth
drinking
if
you
can
get
it
this
ended
up
being
a
much
better
beer
than
it
initially
appeared
im
glad
i
bought
a
six
pack
instead
of
a
single
o
i
have
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
the
past
few
summers
i
highly
recommend
you
get
a
six
pack
today
poured
into
pint
glass
nice
golden
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
nose
is
piney
hops
bit
of
citrus
taste
is
congruent
hoppy
i
feel
like
i
find
some
mango
and
orange
a
little
wheat
overall
great
beer
well
balanced
and
refreshing
with
agreat
crisp
to
relieve
summers
woes
this
wheat
pours
fairly
clear
deep
strawlight
golden
with
a
quickly
diminishing
but
clingy
white
head
the
aroma
is
highly
hoppycitrus
mainly
lemons
the
flavor
is
also
highly
hoppy
lots
of
citrus
quite
lively
on
the
tongue
a
bit
of
wheat
malt
flavor
pokes
through
the
hops
at
the
swallow
a
nice
subtle
surprise
the
finish
is
smooth
and
just
a
bit
dry
the
carbonation
is
mediumhigh
and
body
medium
overall
a
refreshing
yet
subtly
complex
apa
yes
i
call
it
an
apa
glad
ive
finally
tried
this
beer
and
would
gladly
pick
up
a
full
6er
overall
this
stuff
is
everything
i
hoped
it
would
be
just
wish
i
had
more
than
one
six
pack
so
it
looks
like
its
back
to
the
trading
forum
for
me
i
envy
those
with
regular
access
to
this
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
nice
zip
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
spritzy
and
lemony
with
a
hop
kick
a
perfect
summersession
beer
one
of
my
favorites
definitely
a
beer
i
look
for
when
i
am
out
and
the
bottle
label
is
pretty
badass
i
stopped
in
at
bass
pro
shop
in
portage
in
and
they
had
this
on
tap
as
their
house
special
i
knew
3
floyds
knew
their
shit
about
beer
because
they
are
one
of
the
greats
this
beer
at
first
is
not
too
impressive
but
as
hank
the
tank
put
it
once
it
hits
your
lips
it
taste
so
good
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
not
too
much
aroma
coming
off
but
a
slight
citrus
fragrance
in
you
mouth
it
is
a
great
summer
flavor
explosion
going
on
with
taste
of
sweet
summer
citrus
and
honey
going
on
feels
so
good
on
the
palate
i
would
drink
12
of
these
if
i
had
the
time
btw
they
are
pretty
close
to
the
michigan
border
no
wonder
they
know
their
beer
a
good
beer
which
if
i
could
get
it
in
ca
would
buy
a
6
pack
or
2
to
get
me
through
this
hot
summer
overall
this
isnt
like
any
other
wheat
beer
ive
had
and
since
i
havent
had
may
american
pale
wheat
ales
its
hard
to
say
if
this
beer
is
an
outlier
or
just
an
example
of
a
style
i
havent
explored
in
any
event
i
wouldnt
put
this
on
my
favorites
list
but
it
is
new
to
me
and
thats
gotta
count
for
something
i
kept
thinking
how
does
a
brewery
in
middle
of
no
where
indiana
make
beer
that
people
arrange
their
day
around
trying
to
get
now
i
know
this
is
the
perfect
balance
of
a
wheat
beer
and
an
ipa
this
is
an
everyday
beer
and
i
wish
i
had
access
to
it
more
often
enjoy
poured
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
cloudy
goldishyellow
but
not
pale
yellow
like
a
bud
or
anything
like
that
it
has
a
wonderful
citrus
aroma
the
amarillo
hops
it
has
a
nice
citrus
hop
flavor
along
with
a
touch
of
lemon
in
the
taste
carbonation
seemed
a
little
on
the
low
side
and
mouthfeel
was
just
ok
not
too
full
but
not
too
light
overall
its
a
very
tasty
beer
and
not
your
ordinary
wheat
beer
by
any
means
o
great
beer
probably
my
favorite
summer
beer
overall
impression
the
hop
is
too
overpowering
for
the
style
but
i
cant
diss
this
beer
because
its
still
awesome
should
be
a
american
pale
ale
when
it
comes
down
to
it
i
would
get
this
beer
again
if
it
was
more
available
to
me
but
not
sure
what
style
it
is
isnt
anywhere
close
to
an
american
wheat
easily
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
had
if
i
could
get
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
i
would
probably
buy
this
by
the
case
in
the
summer
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
o
goes
down
easy
but
doesnt
live
up
to
its
reputation
if
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smells
this
would
be
amazing

listen
i
as
a
small
minded
standard
do
not
care
for
wheat
beers
i
respect
them
i
just
dont
love
them
so
when
i
had
a
couple
of
these
gumballheads
i
was
not
expecting
too
much
the
great
hops
and
red
wheat
combine
like
chocolate
and
peanutbutterfiguratively
to
make
a
badass
easy
sipping
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
grapefruit
lemon
and
peach
notes
i
loved
it
in
fact
i
want
to
go
back
and
change
my
review
scores
done
so
three
floyds
not
sold
in
my
great
state
your
winning
streak
continues
in
my
book
good
day
from
my
weekend
notes
this
bottle
has
a
heart
of
gold
like
any
good
eighties
comic
underworld
character
smells
nothing
like
a
wheat
ale
but
still
incredibly
satisfying
dripping
with
citrus
piney
hop
madness
this
killer
nose
relays
perfectly
into
the
wheatbeer
anchor
of
the
brew
the
orange
marmalade
hops
blend
with
the
clovey
grassy
malt
creating
a
benchmark
american
wheat
beer
as
a
5
5
brew
id
love
to
see
it
here
in
ms
ill
have
my
next
bottle
side
by
side
with
a
tallgrass
halcyon
which
according
to
my
husband
is
better
tastewise
its
a
close
call
but
i
give
this
brew
my
vote
the
taste
on
this
is
much
more
restrained
than
i
imagined
based
on
the
nose
but
its
still
very
delicious
instead
of
the
hop
attack
that
i
thought
id
be
getting
i
got
a
nice
and
smooth
citrus
lemon
and
grapefruit
mostly
hop
and
wheat
kick
this
trio
just
walks
in
thandem
all
the
way
through
the
finish
with
the
wheat
and
lemon
fading
first
then
the
grapefruit
leaving
a
nice
lingering
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
its
smooth
and
has
a
lively
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
overall
this
is
just
an
extremely
well
crafted
summer
beer
that
id
currently
be
drinking
a
lot
of
if
it
were
in
my
area
but
alas
theres
only
one
overall
a
good
beer
not
amazing
but
good
wish
i
could
get
6ers
of
this
dont
know
why
the
bros
only
gave
it
a
b
definitely
a
beer
to
obtain
again
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
when
i
want
something
slightly
more
bitter
felt
a
bit
watery
but
a
good
beer
overall
gumballhead
turned
out
to
be
much
nicer
than
i
thought
itd
be
the
pour
was
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
looking
fluffy
white
head
on
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
hoppy
wasnt
expecting
that
but
i
like
it
a
lot
the
soft
aromas
of
grains
and
wheat
are
also
in
there
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
wheat
flavor
upfront
that
is
quickly
kicked
away
by
a
rush
of
citrusy
hop
flavors
kind
of
reminded
me
of
hopsun
from
southern
tier
but
on
a
better
scale
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
yet
had
a
good
tingling
finish
overall
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
release
from
3
floyds
id
buy
this
if
theyd
only
distribute
to
pa
again
o
i
am
completely
in
love
with
this
beer
this
beer
drinks
like
a
wheat
but
has
the
taste
of
a
pale
ale
as
well
you
could
seriously
drink
this
all
day
and
the
abv
is
not
ridiculously
high
to
prohibit
you
from
doing
so
on
a
fine
summer
day
this
beer
just
fits
well
its
elements
come
together
very
well
to
form
a
nice
cohesive
experience
ill
drink
to
that
o
very
refreshing
very
easy
i
like
the
different
malt
influence
very
good
beer
disappointing
im
having
my
only
one
i
feel
like
i
could
get
a
keg
of
this
for
the
summer
if
not
year
around
definitely
recommend
this
to
all
that
have
the
opportunity
good
feel
gives
you
a
jab
of
hops
then
goes
a
summer
favorite
overall
its
alright
however
i
wish
it
had
more
bold
flavors
o
this
is
the
beer
that
started
my
journey
into
the
world
of
craft
it
took
me
so
long
to
revisit
because
apparently
people
are
catching
on
to
the
fact
that
3floyds
makes
an
amazingly
tasty
and
drinkable
session
brew
drinkability
i
will
be
able
to
put
this
one
away
no
problem
easy
drinking
and
not
to
heavy
on
the
palate
so
far
good
stuff
but
you
can
tell
its
lower
in
alcohol
and
not
alot
of
malt
going
on
o
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
it
seems
a
little
closer
to
a
pale
ale
than
a
wheat
but
still
very
enjoyable
nice
work
three
floyds
jh
clear
gold
pour
with
a
small
white
head
nice
juicy
mango
and
grapefruit
aroma
with
some
grassy
wheat
maltiness
estery
citrus
flavor
with
a
fair
amount
of
piny
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
a
note
of
clover
honey
mediumthin
body
with
lots
of
tingly
carbonation
what
an
awesome
summertime
beer
i
wish
i
could
buy
it
locally
i
would
drink
the
crap
out
of
this
stuff
my
favorite
americanstyle
wheat
although
admittedly
for
its
combination
of
nontraditional
aspects
with
the
wheat
character
got
another
bottle
of
this
as
an
extra
from
fear025
and
drank
it
last
night
im
upping
the
appearance
and
taste
scores
color
was
a
beautiful
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
that
just
looked
refreshing
taste
was
a
ton
more
citrus
that
i
got
the
first
time
with
more
peach
mango
grapefruit
and
orange
tasted
really
fresh
ill
retract
my
statement
about
oberon
this
beer
is
much
better
and
much
hoppier
wish
i
had
access
to
it
all
the
time
tasty
and
refreshing
id
definitely
return
o
d
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
i
dont
think
its
something
id
really
want
on
a
daily
basis
i
know
people
really
like
this
beer
and
i
can
see
why
but
for
a
wheat
beer
id
rather
have
oberon
and
a
hoppy
beer
id
rather
have
alpha
king
its
good
overall
this
is
a
solid
pale
wheat
ale
and
i
can
see
why
its
considered
one
of
the
best
an
excellent
beer
for
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
no
flaws
just
a
solid
pale
wheat
all
around
worth
picking
up
overall
i
quite
like
this
one
im
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
would
definitely
would
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
in
the
summer
or
with
almost
any
food
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
light
mild
and
straightforward
with
some
decent
flavors
o
solid
beer
i
would
probably
drink
a
lot
of
this
it
was
readily
available
glad
to
have
tried
it
d
a
wheat
beer
for
the
ipa
drinker
well
balanced
great
taste
and
highly
sessionable
i
am
definitely
happy
to
have
received
this
brew
o
enjoyed
this
one
first
offering
from
three
floyds
great
refreshing
summer
beer
would
seek
out
again
o
this
is
the
most
unique
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
and
like
i
mentioned
earlier
it
really
blurs
the
taste
line
between
a
wheat
and
a
pale
ale
with
some
ipa
frutiness
thrown
in
american
pale
wheat
ale
the
category
nailed
it
5
5
for
some
folks
may
not
be
considered
a
session
beer
i
absolutely
hate
that
term
to
begin
with
and
all
the
debates
that
it
seems
to
spark
but
falling
to
the
cliche
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
to
that
definition
as
the
ultimate
i
could
stock
this
stuff
year
around
but
that
wont
happen
especially
since
i
cant
even
get
it
where
i
live
overall
i
must
say
that
if
all
wheats
tasted
as
great
as
this
one
i
might
not
be
such
a
hater
of
the
style
it
goes
to
show
us
that
the
right
brewery
can
do
it
a
bit
better
or
a
bit
different
and
change
our
opinions
as
for
all
the
adjunct
lager
or
even
adjunct
wheat
imo
fans
if
you
started
drinking
this
by
the
twelve
pack
as
you
floated
down
the
river
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
wouldnt
call
all
of
you
beer
pies
thanks
to
handsomebrew
for
the
extra
a
must
try
go
three
floyds
very
solid
i
wish
the
appearance
was
better
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
as
well
wheat
is
very
restrained
almost
like
an
ipa
light
but
in
a
good
way
thank
god
i
got
two
bottles
of
this
because
one
was
not
enough
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
would
say
that
it
is
just
a
little
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
the
creaminess
and
the
full
flavor
of
this
beer
make
up
for
it
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
wow
i
really
wanted
to
be
blown
away
by
this
beer
and
i
suppose
that
lead
me
to
disappointment
weird
that
i
would
use
the
word
disappointment
for
a
beer
and
gave
it
such
a
decent
review
oh
well
i
definitely
will
drink
this
again
just
not
necessarily
going
to
seek
it
out
so
hard
o
i
could
drink
this
unique
beer
all
day
long
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
its
a
damn
easy
drinker
very
crisp
and
refreshing
bitterness
is
balanced
well
by
the
citrus
and
wheat
solid
all
around
o
great
light
pale
ale
with
an
amazingly
smooth
finish
i
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
thank
god
for
the
six
packs
od
i
really
liked
this
one
whenever
i
hear
wheat
beer
the
last
thing
i
am
thinking
is
hops
but
it
was
done
very
well
here
it
has
good
balance
and
drinkability
one
could
easily
go
backtoback
with
this
brew
o
another
quality
beer
from
fff
this
beer
is
a
good
session
beer
refreshing
and
enjoyable
o
great
beer
i
can
see
why
so
many
friends
recommended
it
to
me
the
salesman
at
the
store
told
me
i
was
lucky
to
find
it
since
it
usually
sells
out
the
day
it
arrives
no
surprise
there
worth
seeking
out
i
love
gumballhead
pours
a
light
yellow
with
1
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
this
is
quite
a
hoppy
american
pale
wheat
and
it
works
very
well
for
this
beer
smells
like
grapefruit
and
is
very
citrusy
i
did
not
detect
any
scent
of
gum
or
gumballs
as
some
reviewers
have
claimed
and
i
think
thats
just
a
byproduct
of
the
name
get
this
beer
if
you
can
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
if
where
i
am
at
has
it
on
tap
i
always
get
atleast
one
pretty
tough
to
find
bottles
cause
the
liquor
store
in
my
area
sells
out
pretty
quick
whenever
they
get
it
in
gumballhead
is
a
fitting
name
because
you
can
damn
near
chew
it
its
so
hoppy
great
beer
and
always
a
want
overall
great
yearround
offering
from
fff
you
cant
go
wrong
with
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
drinkable
delicious
and
readily
available
overall
three
floyds
created
another
very
different
beer
with
this
one
this
is
the
wheat
beer
for
the
hophead
o
waite
too
long
to
try
this
beer
great
stuff
this
is
my
new
everyday
beer
i
am
lucky
whereby
i
can
get
it
as
needed
in
bottle
or
on
tap
just
a
few
miles
away
the
hoppyfruity
aromas
titillate
me
each
time
i
drink
this
it
goes
down
so
smooth
i
have
had
a
dozen
or
so
friends
try
this
and
it
becomes
a
staple
in
their
drinking
as
well
three
floyds
has
a
hit
with
this
one
as
far
as
american
wheat
ales
go
gumballhead
is
one
of
the
best
light
enough
to
be
thirstquenching
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
o
love
it
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
once
the
weather
gets
warmer
out
makes
me
want
to
try
many
more
from
three
floyds
this
was
my
first
time
trying
the
beer
and
wow
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
think
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
as
a
perfect
summer
beer
i
love
the
drinkability
and
refreshing
qualities
of
a
wheat
beer
but
im
a
hop
head
so
this
beer
really
hits
the
mark
for
me
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
11
a
six
pack
cheers
o
another
great
offering
from
fff
would
i
take
this
beer
over
other
fff
beers
no
would
i
take
this
beer
over
other
american
wheats
hell
yes
definitely
a
great
beer
in
a
style
that
i
find
to
mainly
have
forgettable
offerings
o
awesome
balance
extremely
refreshing
i
now
have
a
new
opinion
of
this
beer
now
that
ive
tasted
it
in
its
freshest
state
yum
i
wish
that
i
had
easier
access
to
this
quaffable
apwa
i
thought
it
was
dynamite
great
nose
filled
with
tropical
fruits
and
nice
spice
balance
from
the
wheat
if
you
have
stable
access
to
this
beer
consider
your
self
very
fortunate
this
is
just
about
the
perfect
summer
afternoon
brew
very
easy
drinking
with
very
little
aftertaste
t
lots
of
caramel
malts
and
a
hint
of
citrusy
hops
theres
a
bit
of
a
peppery
hop
bite
upfront
and
then
the
taste
gets
overwhelmed
by
the
malt
sweetness
the
wheat
gives
it
an
incredible
smoothness
and
a
fantastic
creamy
mouthfeel
i
would
drink
this
every
day
if
i
could
get
it
here
for
whatever
reason
i
just
dont
trust
that
yellow
guy
on
the
label
anyway
the
beer
behind
him
pours
a
clear
golden
sunlightblonde
topped
by
a
nice
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
pine
orange
peel
light
grapefruit
light
raspberry
banana
light
cardamom
and
some
nice
honeydripped
biscuit
in
the
background
the
taste
doesnt
really
change
this
recipe
all
that
much
but
it
does
come
across
to
me
as
a
slightly
watereddown
slightly
wheatedup
version
of
the
smell
which
does
take
away
from
the
tastiness
imbibed
by
my
strils
it
still
tastes
pretty
damn
good
but
not
as
good
as
it
could
have
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
body
is
a
nice
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisplyfinishing
wet
feel
overall
a
very
nice
if
sort
of
elusive
apwa
one
of
the
best
things
regularly
put
out
by
the
floyds
had
on
tap
at
the
beer
trappe
poured
a
nice
golden
orange
with
a
decent
zesty
white
head
that
lingered
for
some
time
smell
upfront
was
dominated
by
hops
citrus
and
pine
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
followed
by
an
ever
so
faint
bit
of
wheat
and
sweet
caramel
grain
taste
is
very
nice
with
a
crisp
hop
presence
up
front
with
the
smoothness
of
wheat
coming
through
with
a
clean
citrus
hop
finish
everything
balanced
nicely
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
not
heavy
like
some
of
three
floyds
hoppier
beers
can
be
overall
a
tremendous
apwa
and
a
great
beer
to
have
when
the
summer
grill
outs
arrive
good
sessionability
overall
i
dont
think
there
could
be
a
better
apwa
this
particular
style
to
me
is
probably
the
most
boring
and
uninteresting
styles
but
this
is
definitely
not
a
boring
apwa
kudos
fff
a
nice
wheat
tang
with
a
citrusytropical
shitload
of
hop
flavor
not
overly
bitter
but
just
realy
bright
and
fresh
i
would
absolutely
love
to
have
access
to
this
all
the
time
i
do
get
some
of
the
gumball
flavors
i
am
assuming
from
the
yeast
melting
together
with
hops
juicy
and
thirst
quenching
as
hell
man
this
is
great
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
good
amount
of
white
head
on
it
smell
was
very
good
citrusy
wheat
with
some
floral
notes
great
tasting
beer
well
balanced
wheat
and
slight
malt
taste
coming
trough
light
bodied
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
one
went
down
very
smooth
ill
definitely
buy
this
again
and
probably
have
in
my
fridge
pretty
regularly
pours
a
nice
crystal
clear
old
gold
with
a
finger
full
of
head
that
leaves
sticky
curtains
on
my
spiegelau
tulip
the
nose
consists
of
bready
malts
some
sweet
pastry
and
lemon
peel
piney
hops
taste
is
very
lemony
followed
by
crisp
bittering
hops
and
malts
refereshing
taste
if
not
one
dimensional
drinkability
is
high
as
a
sessionable
beer
though
not
too
thought
provoking
overall
this
beer
on
draft
is
insanely
better
than
the
bottles
version
i
could
not
believe
it
actually
was
better
after
hearing
so
from
a
few
friends
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
on
draft
it
definitely
opened
my
eyes
to
how
good
gum
ball
head
actually
can
be
sorry
for
doubting
the
glory
of
the
gum
ball
head
this
was
a
really
enjoyable
balanced
beer
that
made
me
very
happy
those
of
you
who
can
drink
this
often
are
lucky
dogs
taste
is
more
lighter
pale
ale
than
wheat
but
im
not
going
to
get
caught
up
in
the
nuances
of
the
style
this
is
great
beer
looks
like
a
lager
with
a
nice
head
sitting
on
it
clear
slightly
dark
yellow
smells
of
faint
piney
hops
wheat
and
maybe
a
touch
of
corn
or
other
sweetness
taste
is
clean
and
crisp
very
impressive
pine
hops
and
some
sort
of
wheat
lager
come
together
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
deliver
a
super
clean
taste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sweeter
and
heavier
than
i
would
expect
sweetness
just
kind
of
hangs
out
in
the
mouth
but
not
really
as
a
flavor
just
as
a
feeling
overall
this
is
a
goto
beer
if
i
just
want
something
light
that
still
brings
something
to
the
table
i
should
note
that
i
have
heard
people
claim
this
beer
to
tastesmell
like
gumballs
i
did
not
find
this
true
at
all
in
my
case
it
certainly
smelled
good
but
nothing
more
than
the
typical
tropical
fruitheavy
paleipa
for
this
i
was
a
little
disappointed
and
if
that
was
the
true
intention
of
the
brewery
i
might
be
compelled
to
dock
the
beer
another
half
point
for
smelltaste
thanks
to
itsthelibyans
on
reddit
for
this
beer
o
this
is
decent
but
nothing
mindblowing
d
this
goes
down
really
easy
i
really
like
having
this
beer
around
because
its
a
nice
beer
to
have
in
the
summer
what
a
blast
of
hoppy
goodness
friend
of
mine
bought
me
a
6pack
of
this
because
he
thought
i
would
like
to
give
it
a
try
boy
am
i
glad
i
did
this
beer
is
just
loaded
with
hops
flavor
which
is
something
that
usually
turns
me
away
but
the
balance
with
the
maltyness
was
superb
while
a
lot
of
hops
taste
comes
though
it
seems
to
have
a
great
finish
and
the
bitterness
of
it
is
just
right
i
cant
wait
to
drink
the
rest
of
the
pack
and
share
them
with
a
few
friends
this
is
my
favorite
beer
amarillo
hops
gives
it
a
grapefruit
smell
and
citrus
taste
perfect
amount
of
bubbles
the
malt
and
wheat
makes
it
warm
and
fuzzy
in
the
winter
but
light
and
very
refreshing
in
summer
i
realize
now
i
am
a
lucky
sob
living
in
the
the
land
of
3
floyds
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
however
i
feel
like
it
falls
a
bit
behind
lagunitas
lil
sumpin
which
is
an
allstar
in
its
class
in
my
opinion
d
i
knew
this
was
a
hoppy
taste
for
an
american
pale
wheat
but
the
amount
still
surprised
me
a
little
that
being
said
i
think
this
would
be
a
very
refreshing
beer
for
a
warm
day
and
would
certainly
get
it
again
overall
a
very
nice
albeit
hoppy
take
on
the
style
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
lightest
and
most
crisp
ive
had
its
perfect
for
this
beer
and
the
lively
carbonation
keeps
the
mouth
busy
while
preventing
the
beer
from
ever
feeling
watery
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
the
combo
of
the
abv
light
body
flavorful
yet
unimposing
taste
and
tremendous
mouthfeel
is
unstoppable
probably
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
a
very
good
and
unique
creation
by
the
folks
at
fff
well
worth
trying
and
having
again
and
again
if
you
can
get
it
its
a
solid
hoppy
beer
i
apologize
for
the
ratebeer
style
brief
review
but
i
give
this
a
solid
4
0
pours
a
beautiful
golden
body
with
a
bright
white
head
that
stays
most
of
the
way
through
it
leaves
a
nice
white
film
on
the
glass
with
every
drink
smell
is
of
hops
and
wheat
the
smell
is
pretty
straightforward
nothing
crazy
going
on
there
but
doesnt
need
to
be
the
taste
is
great
has
good
mellow
hop
taste
with
a
wheat
finish
great
balance
between
the
two
mouthful
is
what
is
to
be
expected
of
a
great
wheat
beer
very
thin
but
that
is
a
good
thing
overall
this
beer
ranks
up
with
my
favorites
believe
it
or
not
im
not
a
huge
wheat
beer
fan
but
the
blend
of
hops
just
makes
this
perfect
great
sessionable
beer
that
you
can
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
cold
winters
night
d
definitely
happy
that
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
im
sure
ill
be
trading
for
it
again
in
the
future
unless
three
floyds
comes
back
to
ohio
which
would
be
ideal
a
sessionable
and
tastey
beer
that
goes
down
easy
i
could
consume
a
few
in
a
sitting
no
problem
d
very
easy
drink
low
abv
nice
bear
to
drink
on
a
warm
sunny
day
nothing
too
outstanding
still
a
solid
wheat
beer
from
3
floyds
d
the
drinkability
of
this
is
phenomenal
im
enjoying
it
outside
on
a
75
degree
day
and
im
sure
im
going
to
have
no
problem
finishing
the
growler
by
myself
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
is
really
hitting
the
spot
drinks
pretty
well
i
like
wheat
beers
for
everyday
drinking
especially
for
sporting
events
because
theyre
light
and
easy
to
drink
and
of
moderate
alcohol
this
one
fits
right
in
the
beer
is
a
light
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
lemon
with
some
wheat
and
quite
a
bit
more
hops
than
you
usually
get
in
this
style
citrus
sweetness
and
a
significant
hops
flavor
hit
you
first
the
wheat
character
comes
out
a
little
bit
after
the
hops
citrus
fade
but
its
not
very
pronounced
aftertaste
is
lemony
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
bitterness
very
crisp
very
smooth
mediumtohigh
carbonation
medium
body
clean
finish
d

the
wellbalanced
clean
tastes
of
this
brew
and
its
unheaviness
make
this
very
drinkable
for
me
it
is
refreshing
hoppy
sweet
and
smooth
if
only
i
could
get
this
more
frequently
d
this
is
edged
out
by
fresh
lagunitas
little
sumpin
sumpin
if
you
were
strictly
talking
about
american
pale
wheat
ales
but
in
my
head
im
comparing
this
against
pale
ales
in
general
and
even
then
there
are
a
few
i
like
more
hardly
a
bad
beer
just
not
something
im
gaga
over
d
this
goes
down
really
easy
i
wish
i
could
get
lager
quantities
of
this
near
me
because
i
would
love
to
be
able
have
this
waiting
for
me
after
a
long
day
of
work
on
a
nice
spring
day
i
liked
the
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
theres
no
wow
factor
that
made
me
immediately
wish
id
bought
another
growler
of
it
d
i
could
definitely
drink
a
sixer
there
is
no
alcohol
taste
anywhere
i
almost
cant
help
but
down
this
thing
in
a
few
minutes
the
flavor
just
completely
dominates
the
palate
and
leaves
you
with
an
almost
dry
mouth
that
needs
something
to
wet
it
oh
and
look
ive
got
a
beer
in
front
of
me
ill
use
this
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
summer
session
beer
lawnmower
or
patio
low
level
abv
make
this
a
nice
option
pretty
much
like
a
wheat
ipa
drinkability
well
balanced
and
quite
good
i
will
seek
this
out
again
in
the
future
not
your
grandmas
wheat
beer
i
love
this
one
especially
on
tap
d
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
maybe
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
more
i
feel
like
this
beer
changes
every
time
i
have
it
the
first
seemed
to
have
this
delicious
crush
of
sweetness
that
is
mellower
the
more
times
i
try
it
put
this
next
to
an
ipa
and
it
will
fall
flat
but
on
its
own
or
compared
to
other
pale
wheat
ales
gumballhead
really
excels
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
very
simple
beer
that
is
a
great
standby
to
have
around
think
sessionable
try
it
the
cpj
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
light
amber
no
head
at
all
with
a
thin
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
mostly
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
taste
is
similar
with
an
emphasis
on
the
malt
side
of
things
the
hops
are
there
and
provide
a
citrus
zest
on
the
palate
was
hoping
for
more
hop
flavor
but
whats
there
is
nice
the
wheat
gives
this
beer
a
real
nice
body
and
feel
in
your
mouth
carbonation
is
on
the
low
side
but
adequate
hardly
any
bitterness
good
mouthfeel
and
a
flavor
that
is
easily
palatable
all
contribute
to
a
very
drinkable
if
not
terribly
exciting
brew
not
being
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
i
still
find
this
three
floyds
offering
refreshing
and
quite
good
the
addition
of
all
amarillo
hops
add
a
bit
of
a
natural
citrus
character
that
do
this
style
well
no
need
for
an
orange
wedge
on
the
glass
the
orange
flavor
is
right
from
the
bottle
as
intended
by
the
brewer
admittedly
im
enjoying
the
aftertaste
more
than
the
beer
itself
aftertaste
is
again
wheat
bread
but
with
a
lot
of
subtle
sweetness
from
other
malts
and
the
lovely
orange
rind
touches
nice
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
could
definitely
see
this
being
a
great
beer
to
relax
with
in
the
summer
di
love
this
beer
in
the
summer
heck
i
love
this
in
the
winter
it
is
my
go
to
beer
so
i
might
be
alittle
biased
but
def
give
this
beer
a
try
if
you
havent
d
quite
a
drinkable
beer
i
wish
it
were
hotter
out
it
would
pair
well
with
a
warm
day
poured
from
12oz
bottle
no
date
but
label
shows
2007
copyright
which
makes
me
wonder
how
old
this
was
into
tulip
glass
pours
hazy
yellowgolden
with
a
small
rocky
white
head
and
a
few
small
particles
of
sediment
the
head
fades
quickly
to
a
minimal
cover
but
leaves
some
lace
as
it
goes
the
aroma
has
prominent
but
bitter
notes
of
citrus
along
with
some
floral
and
lemon
notes
from
amarillo
hops
there
is
also
a
touch
of
yeast
and
grass
with
some
wheat
the
flavor
starts
with
a
restrained
sweetness
up
front
and
develops
a
tangy
acidity
through
the
middle
hops
are
present
all
the
way
through
and
these
grow
towards
the
finish
the
finish
is
long
with
hops
and
lemony
lingering
on
the
palate
palate
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
watery
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
unconventional
example
of
a
wheat
ale
but
it
is
good
it
is
more
assertive
than
most
wheat
beers
and
much
more
complex
for
the
style
d
a
pleasant
take
on
an
american
wheat
beer
god
light
citrus
and
hop
flavor
plays
well
with
the
wheat
malt
i
really
enjoy
the
use
of
amarillo
hops
medium
bodied
with
a
good
balance
of
earthy
and
citrus
hops
crisp
light
fruit
citrus
peel
and
spice
there
is
some
earthy
pine
needle
and
citrustropical
fruit
notes
from
the
hops
but
it
isnt
as
hop
forward
as
the
aroma
suggests
the
wheat
beer
characteristics
are
much
more
prevalent
in
the
palate
and
flavor
good
balance
of
breadyeast
citrus
peel
and
clove
notes
clean
crisp
and
easy
drinking
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
beer
was
made
for
drinking
it
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
of
the
american
pale
wheat
ales
ive
tried
this
one
stands
out
drinkability
one
the
more
easily
drinkable
beers
that
ive
tasted
in
a
long
time
poured
a
mildly
hazy
light
coppery
orange
with
a
short
lived
white
head
a
band
of
lace
adorns
the
glass
but
not
much
remains
kind
of
a
weak
smell
slight
citrus
hints
and
wheat
tangy
and
fizzy
with
a
decently
strong
citrus
body
but
light
in
other
flavors
mild
wheat
twang
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
not
much
else
here
a
decent
lawnmower
beer
though
drink
i
have
to
say
i
live
in
ca
but
i
am
really
digging
on
three
floyds
lately
thank
god
for
trading
my
friends
a
great
pale
wheat
what
else
can
i
say
a
nice
beer
but
nothing
special
too
much
of
a
sweet
biscuit
and
grain
taste
hops
are
a
little
floral
bitter
not
a
tropical
punch
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
sumpin
sumpin
easy
to
drink
but
not
terribly
deep
now
that
im
thinking
about
it
with
the
limited
supply
of
this
that
comes
out
of
the
brewery
maybe
i
shouldnt
rave
about
this
one
so
much
kidding
drink
this
if
you
have
the
opportunity
you
wont
be
disappointed
pours
amber
with
big
foamy
head
looks
well
carbonated
great
lacing
smells
a
bit
sharp
and
hoppy
with
some
sweetness
on
the
nose
doesnt
smell
particularly
citrusy
like
most
wheat
ales
but
rather
some
sweetness
that
melds
well
with
the
light
wheat
hints
tastes
sweet
and
hoppy
with
some
background
of
wheat
a
tasty
beer
with
a
great
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
for
sure
my
favourite
wheat
beer
verdict
strange
brew
not
really
my
style
worth
trying
out
of
novelty
though
faint
bread
at
first
then
a
giant
sweetness
finishing
off
with
a
huge
wheat
field
rush
hops
and
aromatics
wow
just
flat
out
neat
not
bitter
not
weak
even
a
crispness
i
am
wildly
impressed
by
this
beer
and
wish
i
could
get
more
d
a
highly
drinkable
wheat
beer
that
id
love
have
again
in
the
heat
of
summer
on
a
super
humid
day
sitting
out
in
my
yard
after
working
on
the
garden
this
is
my
number
one
refrigerator
beer
because
more
visitors
seem
to
like
it
over
other
craft
beers
and
the
lowish
abv
means
i
can
drink
it
all
day
long
and
i
do
the
original
sumpin
just
sayin
burnt
gold
with
an
offwhite
head
that
holds
forever
and
leaves
big
lace
sweet
red
wheat
and
fruity
fruity
citrusy
amarillo
rule
this
one
in
the
nose
and
taste
to
me
it
is
a
hop
bomb
and
all
the
fruity
goodness
and
sweet
wheat
translate
into
a
flavor
that
actually
is
reminiscent
of
the
bubblegum
we
used
to
get
as
kids
from
machines
a
little
bit
of
lemon
citrus
tropical
fruit
and
bubblegummy
esters
really
unique
and
quite
hoppy
but
more
so
in
the
dryhop
sense
seeing
as
there
is
minimal
bitterness
in
the
medium
body
that
goes
down
slick
silky
and
a
little
chewy
very
good
very
unique
and
masterfully
balanced
for
such
a
hoppy
beer
still
as
good
as
the
first
time
i
tried
it
this
beer
has
alot
of
the
hop
character
especially
in
the
nose
of
a
good
ipa
or
apa
but
without
the
bitterness
and
as
much
booze
a
great
easy
drinking
stepping
stone
toward
the
hoppy
end
of
the
beer
spectrum
dhands
down
the
best
wheat
brew
out
there
doesnt
even
taste
like
any
other
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
had
easy
drink
with
great
taste
and
aroma
could
drink
this
all
the
time
and
usually
do
get
your
hands
on
some
i
can
give
it
props
for
doing
the
style
well
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
style
that
i
much
enjoy
ho
hum
overall
such
a
tasty
beer
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
american
wheats
but
gumballhead
is
hopped
up
enough
these
will
be
great
once
summer
comes
around
again
perfect
to
bring
to
the
beach
or
just
drink
sitting
around
cheers
light
bodied
and
modestly
carbonated
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
would
go
to
all
summer
long
if
it
was
regulary
available
surprisingly
i
found
this
bottled
offering
to
be
much
more
enjoyable
then
when
i
had
it
on
tap
back
in
april
d
very
drinkable
great
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
i
found
the
beginning
and
the
finish
to
be
even
there
was
no
change
or
crescendo
in
initial
taste
to
swallow
this
is
odd
to
me
as
i
find
almost
all
beers
to
dramatically
change
in
taste
both
during
and
after
the
drinking
process
this
quality
combined
with
the
fruitywheat
yumminess
proves
to
be
an
excellent
drinking
beer
i
will
seek
this
out
again
with
vigor
highly
recommend
d
gumballhead
breaks
the
mold
for
what
a
apwa
can
be
this
is
definitely
up
there
with
little
sumpin
sumpin
i
get
more
bitterness
here
than
in
alpha
king
this
is
very
drinkable
if
i
had
access
to
this
brewery
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
for
sure
d
reminded
me
of
a
light
version
of
their
pride
joy
subtle
aroma
but
followed
with
an
eyeopeningly
brilliant
taste
amarillo
hops
lots
of
them
and
beautifully
done
definitely
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
d
very
drinkable
brew
that
i
will
enjoy
finishing
the
5
i
have
left
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
but
im
not
sure
it
lives
up
to
all
the
hype
it
gets
i
could
easily
drink
a
6pack
of
this
and
love
every
drop
this
is
a
great
wheat
ale
but
one
of
the
hardest
to
find
even
though
i
work
at
a
liquor
store
we
only
get
a
limited
supply
so
if
you
fall
in
love
stock
up
i
have
to
applaud
three
floyds
for
having
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
overall
i
really
like
this
it
is
a
thinner
smaller
pale
ale
hard
to
even
tell
that
there
is
wheat
in
there
just
a
graininess
in
the
finish
i
dont
detect
any
specialty
grains
at
all
this
is
a
simple
refreshing
summer
beer
for
those
that
love
american
hops
i
must
say
that
im
not
entirely
sold
on
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
there
wasnt
anything
unpleasant
about
this
beer
but
as
a
pale
wheat
ale
i
just
was
not
getting
as
much
of
the
wheat
side
as
i
expected
the
balance
seemed
to
swing
more
towards
an
ipa
if
anything
it
definitely
has
more
flavor
than
your
average
americanstyle
wheat
beer
thanks
to
the
hop
presence
so
id
say
it
sits
above
the
likes
of
sam
adams
summer
ale
or
gis
312
but
the
question
is
it
worthy
of
all
the
hype
it
receives
im
not
sure
i
can
say
after
one
tasting
will
have
to
try
another
bottle
to
see
if
does
enough
to
change
my
tastes
or
my
opinion
this
is
super
drinkable
and
by
far
the
best
american
wheat
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
it
makes
me
wish
that
more
breweries
were
making
wheat
beers
like
this
yet
another
great
beer
from
three
floyds
d
just
a
fantastic
drink
one
of
my
personal
favorites
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
and
be
very
happy
fff
brewers
did
a
fantastic
job
coming
up
with
a
unique
blend
of
ingredients
to
produce
a
memorable
beer
d
gumballhead
is
another
unbelievable
brew
from
fff
i
challenege
anyone
to
find
a
better
drinkable
brew
for
a
resfreshing
drink
i
will
try
to
find
more
of
these
somehow
someway
gumballhead
my
favorite
beer
love
that
its
brewed
here
in
indiana
as
well
which
makes
it
readily
available
pours
a
light
bronze
color
with
a
light
head
leaves
a
lacy
trail
the
taste
is
wonderful
the
wheat
is
prevalent
and
delicious
a
great
beer
overall
enjoyed
year
round
really
though
with
fff
you
cant
go
wrong
i
received
a
6er
of
this
from
a
trade
with
atown
from
illinois
and
i
was
quite
pleased
with
the
trade
and
this
beer
i
wish
i
was
drinking
this
in
the
summer
because
this
looks
quenchtastic
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
bubbly
carbonation
floating
through
my
glass
the
head
was
about
34
of
an
inch
and
of
average
density
unfortunately
the
head
dissipated
quickly
after
the
first
two
sips
if
i
were
to
judge
the
style
of
beer
by
smell
alone
i
would
be
convinced
that
this
was
a
straightup
ipa
i
did
not
detect
any
wheat
in
the
nose
though
im
no
bloodhound
the
taste
was
good
but
not
what
i
expected
which
made
trying
this
beer
fun
it
has
interesting
depth
with
the
hopwheat
combo
the
emphasis
is
certainly
on
the
hops
and
they
have
a
pine
flavor
to
them
which
i
really
liked
the
wheat
played
second
fiddle
in
this
brew
to
the
hops
the
more
subtle
flavor
of
the
wheat
may
be
a
letdown
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
wheat
beer
but
if
you
enjoy
wheat
beers
and
ipas
then
its
a
fun
blend
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
and
its
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
good
middle
ground
between
two
of
my
favorite
summer
styles
overall
this
is
an
easy
beer
for
an
ipa
drinker
to
drink
but
probably
not
what
most
wheat
beer
drinkers
would
have
in
mind
it
is
bold
strong
and
delicious
my
favorite
wheat
beer
and
like
most
3floyds
products
deviates
from
the
norm
into
areas
that
produce
pleasant
surprises
d
despite
the
low
mouthfeel
score
gumballhead
is
still
an
excellent
brew
and
i
would
purchase
cases
of
it
during
the
summer
months
if
only
fff
would
distribute
to
pa
the
greedy
sobs
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting
american
wheat
beers
that
ive
had
gumballhead
is
a
beverage
that
i
will
certainly
look
for
again
maybe
its
just
because
i
like
hops
so
much
but
id
say
its
my
favorite
wheat
beer
that
ive
tried
so
far
yet
another
winner
from
3
floyds
d
very
drinkable
mow
the
lawn
in
the
summer
drinkable
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
im
ashamed
that
it
took
me
this
long
to
get
my
hands
on
some
i
sure
wish
three
floyds
would
distribute
to
pa
im
going
to
have
to
get
tons
more
of
this
in
trades
i
love
the
combination
of
wheat
and
boat
loads
of
hops
d
nice
carbonization
and
light
for
me
this
beer
starts
out
slow
and
finishes
strong
this
is
quite
different
from
most
beers
i
drink
all
in
all
i
will
rereview
when
i
get
more
but
as
it
stands
right
now
this
beer
is
awesome
and
seek
it
out
d
all
day
all
night
drinkability
this
is
a
lot
better
than
most
of
the
boring
beers
in
the
category
and
is
a
great
light
change
of
pace
from
a
great
three
floyds
lineup
overall
a
truly
remarkable
brew
its
not
really
a
wheat
beer
its
not
a
pa
or
ipa
its
doesnt
really
have
a
style
but
whatever
it
is
its
great
a
real
masterpiece
of
subtlety
from
a
brewery
that
isnt
know
for
pulling
punches
and
the
quintessential
summer
beer
recommended
the
overall
flavor
isnt
bursting
but
the
flavor
itself
is
very
good
the
hops
in
this
show
up
much
more
in
the
flavor
than
the
smell
the
bitter
herbal
resinous
hops
rest
underneath
a
crisp
citrus
edge
on
top
chewed
weak
bubble
gum
shows
up
along
with
orange
and
lemon
something
in
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
fresh
hop
pellets
before
brewing
and
its
a
nice
addition
i
wish
i
could
get
more
three
floyds
in
ga
because
this
is
a
masterpiece
of
subtlety
overall
very
drinkable
and
tasty
o
solid
flavor
but
not
the
interpretation
of
the
style
that
i
am
looking
for
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
two
and
a
half
fingers
ifwhite
head
that
stays
for
a
while
and
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
are
citrus
hips
slight
piney
hips
and
some
wheat
the
citrus
hop
smell
makes
my
mouth
water
amazing
the
taste
is
citrus
hops
up
front
followed
by
some
wheat
and
a
nice
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
great
and
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
this
beer
is
definitely
the
best
or
one
of
the
beat
in
this
style
and
its
easily
sessionable
pale
golden
with
a
thick
pillowy
head
lemon
zest
and
pinapple
in
the
aroma
similar
flavors
pineapple
lemon
and
grapefruit
the
hops
are
wonderfully
flavorful
with
out
being
over
agressive
other
than
the
lemon
theres
not
much
that
screams
wheat
beer
to
me
nice
light
mouthfeel
the
essential
summer
beer
imo
d
damn
good
i
can
see
why
this
is
six
packed
and
not
in
22oz
if
this
was
a
local
offering
for
me
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
and
a
constant
order
at
my
local
watering
hole
this
beer
is
tough
to
classify
not
a
true
wheat
but
i
guess
americans
twist
on
it
hoppy
a
great
beer
anytime
of
the
year
md
light
to
medium
bodied
very
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
a
great
beer
moves
right
near
the
top
of
my
list
could
easily
drink
this
one
all
night
long
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
im
not
sure
if
it
was
just
the
way
the
bartender
gave
me
the
beer
but
it
had
no
real
head
on
it
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
decidedly
hoppy
and
i
must
say
im
surprised
at
that
for
the
style
however
and
nice
and
orangepiny
the
scent
maybe
i
would
still
have
liked
to
smells
some
wheat
which
did
manage
to
elude
my
nostrils
the
taste
is
surprisingly
pleasant
i
was
due
to
the
aroma
expecting
a
mouthfull
of
juicy
hops
instead
what
i
was
awarded
with
was
a
sweet
fruitiness
i
believe
that
i
was
able
to
taste
some
nectarines
and
pineapple
in
the
flavor
there
was
a
hint
of
bitterness
still
which
i
didnt
much
care
for
but
i
must
admit
this
beer
went
down
smooth
as
silk
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
know
most
people
would
kill
to
have
this
on
tap
all
the
time
but
as
excellent
as
this
beer
is
it
doesnt
have
that
wow
factor
that
i
look
for
still
a
great
beer
and
a
recommendation
from
me
lighter
to
medium
body
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
creaminess
crazy
drinkability
on
this
one
lighter
abv
great
flavor
refreshing
and
avoids
becoming
too
dry
or
bitter
this
was
my
first
fff
beer
and
its
living
up
to
the
hype
drinkability
a
great
wheat
beer
that
doesnt
overwhelm
you
with
adjunct
flavor
would
definitely
come
back
to
this
one
d
very
drinkable
beer
would
be
great
in
the
summer
months
d
beyond
recommended
d
extremely
drinkable
very
sessionable
a
go
to
drink
among
many
of
the
fff
brewing
everything
ive
had
ive
loved
the
bodi
is
light
to
medium
with
an
aggressive
carbonation
level
to
make
it
seem
lighter
the
mouthfeel
also
has
a
texture
of
what
i
associate
with
a
decent
percentage
of
wheat
malt
used
its
kind
of
creamy
and
slick
but
not
in
a
bad
way
its
just
what
have
recognized
as
a
common
trait
in
most
beers
with
wheat
its
highly
drinkable
though
and
i
can
surely
understand
why
there
is
such
demand
for
this
beer
overall
a
really
nice
everyday
beer
d
i
could
drink
on
this
all
day
i
wish
it
were
still
in
ohio
drinkability
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
in
this
style
that
ive
had
the
best
ones
seem
to
be
the
hop
forward
ones
but
this
one
retains
some
wheatbeerishness
unlike
a
beer
like
little
sumpin
sumpin
which
is
more
like
an
ipa
with
a
little
wheat
malt
this
would
be
a
great
summertime
or
barbeque
beer
d
i
can
see
why
people
go
nuts
over
this
a
fantastic
beer
worth
it
and
then
some
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
of
a
weakpoint
here
medium
in
body
but
carbonation
is
low
for
a
wheat
ale
that
being
said
this
would
be
a
goto
beer
for
me
if
it
were
available
locally
its
really
quite
enjoyable
particularly
when
its
fresh
enough
to
bring
out
these
wonderful
citrus
hops
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
soft
and
crisp
flavor
definitely
want
more
thanks
kruthar
for
this
i
had
heard
a
lot
of
hype
surrounding
gumballhead
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
while
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
all
the
hype
did
not
live
up
to
my
tasting
it
has
a
very
hoppy
smell
almost
to
the
point
of
an
ipa
and
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
the
taste
is
smooth
and
mellow
but
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
body
and
girth
to
it
on
the
plus
side
it
is
has
no
bad
after
taste
worth
a
try
to
form
your
own
opinion
about
it
drinkabilitythis
is
a
great
sessionable
ipa
theres
not
a
huge
amount
of
complexity
in
this
beer
but
its
got
lots
of
drinkability
pours
a
very
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
the
dies
down
leaving
sticky
lace
on
the
sides
aroma
grapefruit
and
tangerine
are
dominant
with
some
grainy
base
aroma
underneath
the
amarillo
hops
really
dominate
here
flavor
starts
with
sweetbitter
grapefruit
up
front
and
continues
through
to
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
and
refreshingly
dry
with
a
bit
of
resinous
hop
flavor
that
sticks
to
the
tongue
this
beer
tastes
like
happy
lower
the
alcohol
by
1
5
abv
and
well
talk
very
good
now
that
i
am
done
singing
praises
i
have
to
say
that
3
floyds
has
done
a
pretty
good
job
of
making
their
mediocre
beers
look
awesome
i
have
had
dark
lord
on
one
occasion
and
that
too
is
contributing
towards
my
opinion
a
wonderful
treat
of
a
wheat
beer
d
definitely
a
topshelf
american
wheat
ale
but
still
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
lagunitas
little
sumpin
sumpin
glad
i
tried
it
all
the
same
hoppiness
is
aggressive
without
making
the
feel
too
sticky
d
probably
the
best
hop
smell
of
any
beer
that
is
not
an
ipa
i
really
like
amarillo
hops
and
this
beer
is
a
fine
showcase
of
their
potential
this
is
a
unique
and
tasty
brew
d
session
beer
and
a
solid
one
very
drinkable
this
is
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
ive
had
im
giving
a
few
tenths
of
a
point
up
on
this
category
because
the
label
is
awesome
drinkability
unbelievably
high
d
oh
so
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
easy
access
to
this
because
it
would
be
forever
in
my
fridge
this
is
a
must
try
for
any
beer
nerd
d
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
im
so
glad
fff
made
this
part
of
their
standard
flagship
lineup
rather
than
an
overpriced
bomber
the
way
it
used
to
be
i
had
this
one
on
tap
and
it
was
a
cloudy
pale
straw
yellow
and
golden
in
color
with
a
light
white
head
it
had
a
nice
piny
citrusy
grapefruit
aroma
to
it
with
light
yeast
and
sweetness
the
taste
was
excellent
it
was
very
citrusy
with
slight
hoppiness
to
it
and
had
a
dry
yeasty
after
taste
it
was
very
light
but
well
carbonated
crisp
and
smooth
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
around
its
excellent
on
tap
so
grab
it
if
you
can
find
it
d
good
this
is
a
refreshing
fullflavored
beer
thats
pretty
easy
drinking
very
light
lingering
aftertaste
is
pleasant
and
calls
me
back
for
more
fantastic
d
a
really
tasty
beer
overall
i
just
wish
there
was
a
hint
more
malt
and
body
would
be
a
quite
enjoyable
summer
hop
fix
ill
buy
it
again
but
only
in
the
summer
while
not
as
earthshattering
as
i
was
expecting
a
very
nice
apwa
interesting
to
see
such
a
hopforward
wheat
beer
and
i
would
definitely
have
this
more
often
if
it
were
available
to
me
got
a
six
pack
of
this
from
a
great
ba
recently
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
is
pale
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
sitting
atop
a
lively
body
the
aroma
is
sweet
like
bananas
and
strawberries
with
a
solid
wheat
and
grain
aroma
in
the
background
slight
hop
aroma
with
a
mild
sweetness
make
this
fun
to
dip
my
nose
into
tastes
like
it
smells
sweet
fruits
with
solid
grains
if
this
was
local
it
would
definitely
be
a
goto
beer
for
me
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonated
nicely
a
solid
wheat
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
i
would
take
this
anytime
average
mouthfeel
and
super
high
drinkability
make
this
a
fantastic
offering
i
would
love
more
of
this
for
the
summer
o
while
its
an
outstanding
everyday
brew
the
flavor
is
a
bit
lacking
and
leaves
me
wanting
still
very
good
d
well
this
beer
is
super
drinkable
every
day
of
the
year
hot
cold
inbetween
it
doesnt
matter
its
smooth
refreshing
and
smells
awesome
this
is
definitely
somewhat
of
a
hybrid
ipawheat
the
taste
and
aroma
of
a
wonderful
ipa
mixed
with
the
lightness
of
a
refreshing
wheat
3fs
was
right
its
not
normal
a
very
refreshing
beer
one
beer
i
would
order
and
order
over
again
a
great
flavor
light
bodied
and
nothing
too
bitter
to
where
you
can
enjoy
drinking
36
in
a
night
might
be
a
go
to
beer
when
going
to
a
party
that
is
byob
d
very
easy
to
drink
probably
due
to
the
low
abv
good
session
beer
man
this
was
delicious
fairly
light
easydrinking
refreshing
the
dryness
hits
at
the
perfect
time
to
bring
me
back
for
more
could
definitely
go
through
multiples
of
this
in
a
row
again
much
love
to
mavajo
for
the
extra
this
one
kicks
ass
pours
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
tinge
of
straw
yellow
to
it
one
and
half
fingers
of
head
here
quickly
fades
to
a
very
thin
layer
of
head
with
a
bigger
collar
aroma
is
a
very
pleasant
citrus
hop
led
by
some
orange
nectarine
and
peach
a
touch
of
lemon
rind
here
as
well
with
some
malty
sweetness
underneath
it
taste
has
a
nice
wheat
character
to
it
well
duh
decorated
with
citrus
hop
profile
thats
exceptionally
refreshing
for
the
style
follows
the
aroma
pretty
well
for
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
approximates
the
perfect
summer
beer
and
is
incredibly
sessionable
this
is
a
good
beer
one
that
ill
go
to
again
for
a
nice
summer
drink
or
to
remind
me
of
summer
gumballhead
is
the
hoppiest
american
pale
wheat
ale
that
i
have
consumed
because
of
its
higher
hops
to
me
it
is
closer
to
an
ipa
with
an
american
wheat
base
than
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
overall
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
if
i
could
only
drink
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
without
a
doubt
it
would
be
this
drinkability
damn
drinkable
and
sessionable
imo
had
this
before
and
that
is
why
i
picked
it
up
again
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
came
damn
close
to
getting
a
5
in
this
department
hint
of
citrus
and
body
toneaug
13
backfat
all
in
all
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
with
a
crescendo
of
hops
really
really
enjoyed
it
d
very
nice
i
would
drink
this
all
day
if
it
was
available
i
had
this
once
before
several
months
ago
and
didnt
think
much
of
it
but
justin
hooked
me
up
with
a
fresh
sixer
from
the
brewery
and
was
very
impressed
thanks
to
drew
for
tossing
this
in
at
first
glance
i
was
very
dissapointed
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
the
hoppy
smells
got
me
excited
again
this
was
a
very
solid
wheat
for
me
the
extra
hoppiness
from
the
amirrilo
hops
is
outstanding
pours
a
yellowish
cloudy
golden
with
a
thick
frothy
head
that
sticks
around
nicely
very
clean
smell
fresh
cut
grass
with
some
pine
and
wheat
notes
some
lemon
or
manderine
orange
is
in
there
too
wheat
beers
are
usually
not
my
favorite
i
usually
find
them
kind
of
bland
with
an
aftertaste
that
doesnt
do
much
for
me
this
beer
has
great
flavor
there
is
a
twang
from
the
wheat
that
is
blended
nicely
by
a
sweet
toasty
caramel
flavor
very
nice
pine
and
grapefruit
bite
at
the
finish
reminded
me
somewhat
of
seirra
nevada
pale
ale
very
nice
crisp
bitterness
in
this
beer
more
of
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
than
you
get
from
most
wheats
ive
heard
about
how
good
this
stuff
is
for
years
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
gotten
around
to
try
it
good
stuff
the
other
five
bottles
wont
last
long
notes
drinkability
is
definitely
good
i
could
drink
several
of
these
i
only
wish
that
i
had
that
many
to
enjoy
for
everyone
who
can
get
their
hands
on
gumballhead
on
a
regular
basis
i
am
extremely
jealous
of
you
extremely
drinkable
a
world
class
example
of
the
style
cheers
pours
an
nice
golden
orange
colour
with
little
head
well
carbonated
smells
like
grapefruit
and
lemon
very
citrusy
with
a
little
hop
aroma
behind
it
all
tastes
really
good
lots
of
citrus
there
with
a
sweet
hop
on
the
palate
very
refreshing
left
almost
no
aftertaste
probably
the
only
downside
of
this
beer
but
that
might
be
just
my
personal
taste
drinks
really
well
overall
would
love
to
drink
this
again
d
wheat
beers
are
not
my
favorite
but
this
one
is
probably
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
think
anchor
summer
is
highly
underrated
but
this
one
is
probably
even
better
on
a
hot
day
there
is
a
lot
more
hops
in
this
than
i
expected
tastes
a
lot
like
a
pale
ale
wheat
is
right
there
though
to
add
that
hay
like
flavor
pours
a
medium
golden
with
a
substantial
head
that
leaves
about
an
inch
of
foam
and
significant
lacing
aroma
features
an
intense
hops
presence
with
grapefruitcitrus
notes
very
prominent
taste
features
more
hopsgrapefruity
intensity
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
could
benefit
from
more
carbonation
the
intensity
of
the
hops
in
this
beer
is
enjoyable
but
it
probably
limits
this
beers
drinkability
for
those
who
prefer
a
more
subtle
approach
seemed
untraditional
for
a
wheat
beer
but
wow
this
was
tasty
my
glass
just
disappeared
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
resiny
hops
with
some
wheat
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
resiny
and
piney
with
some
wheat
medium
bitterness
this
is
basically
an
american
india
wheat
ale
and
it
is
delicious
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
very
refreshing
hop
forward
beer
that
i
would
strain
to
call
a
wheat
that
being
said
it
tastes
good
and
3f
has
never
been
known
for
sticking
to
style
d
and
another
three
floyds
beer
blows
me
away
i
love
this
especially
since
i
just
got
home
from
a
long
hot
day
at
work
crisp
refreshing
quaffable
absolutely
the
best
summer
beer
ive
had
more
please
pours
an
interesting
yelloworange
hue
into
a
perfect
pint
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
wheat
and
a
skunky
sour
apple
undertone
taste
is
dominated
by
what
im
guessing
are
summit
hops
then
fades
to
a
citrusy
slightly
wheaty
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
a
bit
chewy
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
the
key
component
of
this
beer
is
the
carbonation
ive
never
noted
how
critical
it
was
in
the
tasting
of
craft
beer
before
today
its
departure
and
arrival
into
my
glass
ring
in
different
experiences
hell
if
you
werent
careful
you
may
ruin
this
beer
by
deflating
it
too
fast
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
beer
is
perfect
for
drinking
regularly
id
buy
it
again
and
again
if
there
wasnt
so
much
more
to
try
in
the
world
the
hype
of
a
beer
lived
up
to
my
expectations
for
once
d
easy
drinking
and
good
taste
and
lots
of
hops
this
is
a
hop
delivery
medium
with
some
good
wheat
in
the
back
nothing
wrong
here
except
the
appearance
d
once
it
warmed
up
it
tasted
more
like
a
pale
ale
and
not
a
wheat
pale
very
interesting
and
delicious
goes
down
so
smooth
this
could
be
a
session
beer
andor
have
a
few
of
them
in
a
night
d
chuggable
its
no
mistake
that
this
is
the
highest
rated
american
pale
wheat
ale
on
beeradvocate
thanks
corey
for
sending
me
this
one
this
will
be
the
closest
i
get
to
sheffields
in
chicago
this
year
after
spending
4
hours
or
so
in
the
bleachers
ill
miss
the
8
or
so
gumballheads
at
sheffields
this
week
but
i
will
still
feel
that
i
was
there
by
having
this
it
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
if
you
ever
find
yourself
in
the
chicago
area
pick
yourself
up
a
6pck
or
find
a
bar
that
offers
a
pint
this
is
one
worth
trying
cheers
the
fact
that
this
is
a
wheat
beer
blows
my
mind
this
is
the
one
beer
that
truly
builds
up
to
the
hype
that
surrounds
it
best
wheat
beer
ever
is
a
complete
understatement
when
i
smelt
this
beer
a
smile
came
on
my
face
and
i
was
content
with
just
sniffing
it
all
night
but
then
came
the
taste
i
felt
like
i
was
punched
in
the
face
with
the
most
intense
hops
of
a
strong
ipa
until
they
mellowed
out
and
i
was
left
with
one
of
the
most
pleasant
tastes
ever
hook
me
up
to
an
iv
of
this
and
ill
be
good
forever
three
floyds
please
distribute
in
ohio
again
because
i
will
be
honest
i
hate
going
to
indiana
it
is
the
flattest
drive
and
bores
me
we
are
good
neighbors
and
your
beer
should
probably
come
over
the
border
in
an
easier
manner
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
every
day
and
be
more
than
happy
d
incredibly
drinkable
nay
quaffable
i
could
easily
put
a
6pack
of
this
down
in
a
sitting
and
its
fing
addicting
do
they
put
crack
in
this
beer
drinkability
its
alright
basically
this
is
your
average
brewpubs
pale
ale
being
called
a
american
pale
wheat
ale
nothing
great
poured
a
cloudy
golden
sparkling
color
with
a
very
minimal
head
very
strong
hop
aromas
on
this
brew
a
whole
lot
of
fruitiness
as
well
not
just
citrus
fruits
either
im
picking
up
a
lot
of
grapes
and
apple
scents
the
taste
is
definitely
fruity
i
get
a
lot
of
green
grapes
and
apples
on
my
palate
along
with
some
very
subtle
hops
i
nice
sweet
fruity
taste
lingers
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
very
delightful
with
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
bite
extremely
drinkable
great
summertime
beer
i
obtained
a
12
ounce
bottle
from
enelson
i
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
hazy
yellow
with
a
sticky
2
finger
white
head
lots
of
floral
hops
on
the
aroma
the
beer
is
floral
and
fruity
very
assertive
hopping
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
fruitiness
it
was
light
in
body
and
high
in
carbonation
this
worked
for
me
it
drinks
more
like
a
apa
than
a
wheat
beer
this
is
interestingly
hoppy
for
a
wheat
beer
very
solid
light
to
medium
gold
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
moderate
head
lots
of
carbonation
lemon
citrus
grapefruit
all
in
one
yum
yum
light
crip
lemony
grapefruit
finishes
clean
super
summer
beer
full
of
flavor
without
any
heaviness
i
could
really
put
these
down
edit
the
more
i
drank
this
there
were
peach
undertones
that
started
to
come
out
d
a
wonderfully
executed
hoppy
wheat
ale
both
light
bodied
and
dangerously
drinkable
yet
full
flavored
unique
and
delicious
i
would
buy
this
by
the
case
if
it
was
readily
available
overall
a
very
good
summer
beer
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
and
would
recommend
it
as
a
beer
to
have
on
hand
in
the
warmer
months
if
you
have
access
incredibly
drinkable
i
would
definitely
session
this
if
only
3fs
were
distributed
in
california
dthis
is
a
hugely
drinkable
wheat
beer
but
more
like
an
ipa
ftons
of
hops
with
a
light
note
of
wheat
the
acetone
in
the
finish
is
a
little
off
putting
but
the
hops
are
huge
d
a
pretty
good
wheat
ale
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
floral
and
citrus
hops
would
try
again
really
an
impressive
wheat
beer
from
this
obviously
very
talented
brewery
comments
thanks
goes
out
to
dvelcich
he
sent
this
beer
to
me
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
a
hoppy
wheat
beer
certainly
not
conventional
nonetheless
an
interesting
experimentation
within
the
style
notes
highly
recommended
thanks
bliss
in
wauconda
il
for
the
great
singles
selection
pours
a
golden
colour
with
thick
head
that
left
some
lacing
the
smell
of
hops
immediately
hit
me
before
i
even
lift
the
glass
it
still
has
the
smell
of
a
wheat
beer
just
with
a
lot
of
hops
in
it
the
taste
is
wonderfully
refreshing
with
the
hop
bitterness
combining
with
the
banana
and
lemon
of
the
wheat
beer
wonderful
to
drink
and
i
wish
i
could
have
had
more
than
one
i
have
a
housewarming
party
coming
up
and
this
will
be
the
keg
i
choose
a
great
summer
beer
a
very
solid
beer
not
outstanding
but
very
good
d
big
time
super
easy
to
drink
way
too
fast
this
and
new
glarus
crackd
wheat
are
twins
seprated
at
birth
i
did
a
sideby
tasting
of
the
two
and
they
were
so
close
i
had
a
tough
time
choosing
what
beer
was
what
the
great
nose
flavors
and
thin
mf
make
this
one
of
the
if
not
the
most
drinkable
beers
on
the
market
today
i
would
rate
this
higher
than
a
5
if
possible
md
light
and
prickly
mouthfeel
highly
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
all
day
mouthfeel
light
but
coats
the
mouth
very
sessionable
i
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
while
watching
the
cubs
on
tv
a
few
blocks
from
wrigley
field
the
head
is
nice
and
tall
and
the
body
is
slightly
hazy
and
a
shade
darker
in
the
golden
color
spectrum
crisp
hops
up
front
that
fade
considerably
toasted
biscuits
light
tropical
fruits
mango
orange
juice
more
viscosity
and
not
as
dry
as
expected
for
the
style
enjoyable
non
the
less
easy
drinking
especially
when
the
hot
midwest
summer
months
roll
around
will
probally
be
buy
a
few
packs
over
the
summer
this
was
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
drink
my
wifes
comment
was
that
this
would
be
good
with
barbecue
and
i
think
she
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
if
you
brought
some
of
this
to
your
next
outdoor
dinner
with
friends
i
believe
it
would
go
over
well
in
spades
light
golden
amber
with
a
onefinger
head
which
quickly
settled
to
a
coating
lacing
was
thin
but
lasting
nose
was
lemon
zest
wheat
and
floral
with
a
sweet
bready
undertone
good
carbonation
taste
follows
the
nose
hops
are
there
and
up
front
like
an
apa
or
ipa
but
they
are
quickly
beaten
back
by
the
malty
sweetness
the
aftertaste
remains
sweet
but
with
a
nice
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
smooth
thin
and
pleasantly
sticky
at
a
little
over
4
this
beer
is
definitely
sessionable
yep
already
i
want
more
d
this
is
a
brew
i
could
drink
all
day
long
in
the
summertime
fff
outdid
themselves
brewing
this
one
and
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
in
my
area
i
will
certainly
be
recommending
this
to
my
friends
would
have
given
it
another
5
if
didnt
have
to
deal
with
the
hassle
of
getting
the
beer
d
was
kinda
flat
for
the
style
but
i
always
enjoy
a
fff
beer
overall
had
a
good
nose
and
a
decent
flavor
wouldnt
mind
having
some
more
d
amazing
seriously
i
could
drink
this
all
day
without
getting
tired
of
it
easily
the
best
american
wheat
beer
ive
had
too
bad
three
floyds
beers
arent
available
anywhere
close
to
here
d
the
best
although
i
may
be
hopbiased
wheat
beer
ive
had
to
date
great
summer
beer
easy
drinking
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
d
goes
down
very
very
easy
i
imagine
a
six
pack
of
this
could
be
killed
quite
easily
ill
let
you
know
how
it
goes
d
seemed
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
style
but
id
probably
pick
up
another
if
i
ever
come
across
it
again
uber
refreshing
delicious
low
in
abv
and
goes
down
like
water
this
beer
is
drinkability
d
definition
of
a
session
beer
could
put
back
quite
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
really
dont
think
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
of
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
out
there
pours
a
very
pale
orange
with
a
fluffy
2finger
white
head
eventually
a
ring
leaves
barely
any
lacing
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
floats
in
a
standstill
although
this
looks
like
a
pretty
typical
pale
wheat
the
smell
and
taste
is
anything
but
lots
of
fresh
fruity
hops
orange
peel
and
pine
the
taste
is
excellent
im
getting
citrus
pine
and
lemon
nice
caramel
malt
and
an
amount
hops
that
could
be
sufficient
for
an
ipa
im
already
getting
hop
burps
after
a
few
sips
if
youre
really
looking
for
a
wheat
taste
you
will
probably
be
disappointed
im
not
getting
any
until
the
end
a
nice
fruity
wheat
finish
gumballhead
is
easily
a
standout
in
a
usually
dull
style
there
is
so
much
flavor
and
body
here
for
a
4
8
beer
so
drinkable
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
i
finished
this
very
quickly
and
enjoyed
every
second
of
it
this
may
be
the
ultimate
session
beer
if
i
ever
am
in
their
distribution
area
i
will
try
to
pick
up
a
case
of
it
three
floyds
is
definitely
solid
in
my
book
right
now
thanks
to
sportscrazed2
for
sending
this
out
my
way
d
very
high
drinkabilty
i
think
this
beer
is
perfect
for
any
occasion
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
so
ill
be
drinking
this
one
till
the
end
always
stocked
in
my
fridge
mediumbodied
slightly
fizzy
up
front
but
finishes
smooth
and
malty
with
a
banana
aftertaste
pretty
good
and
a
nice
transition
brew
from
the
megas
to
real
beers
d
unlike
any
wheat
brew
i
have
ever
tried
its
easily
my
favorite
might
not
be
the
poster
beer
for
the
style
however
its
10x
better
than
any
wheat
ive
had
before
this
would
def
be
a
go
to
brew
for
me
i
could
drink
this
all
day
perfect
5
here
great
beer
the
hoppy
wheat
thing
works
perfectly
here
poured
with
a
nice
fine
foamy
frothy
off
white
head
and
good
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
aroma
is
malty
hoppy
and
fruity
flavors
similar
body
is
excellent
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
a
tad
sweet
but
very
well
balanced
very
drinkable
session
beer
d
high
drinkability
here
nice
complexity
too
for
its
measly
4
8
abv
if
this
stuff
was
a
couple
bucks
cheaper
a
6pack
it
would
have
a
permanent
spot
in
my
fridge
during
the
summer
i
need
to
do
a
sidebyside
comparison
between
this
and
ngs
crackd
wheat
for
fun
amazingly
refreshing
and
clean
the
ultimate
session
beer
along
with
weihenstephaner
hefeweiss
and
i
can
only
imagine
this
to
be
the
best
tailgate
beer
my
only
regret
is
living
outside
of
the
fff
distribution
range
d
this
is
damn
drinkable
i
only
wish
i
had
a
second
the
flavor
pops
amarillo
piney
and
citrusy
hop
notes
with
a
background
of
caramel
malt
the
finish
has
floral
notes
lingering
bitterness
a
bit
out
of
place
for
a
wheat
again
and
somewhat
dry
cookielike
malt
finish
too
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
in
a
bjcp
competition
would
totally
flunk
out
of
the
style
guidelines
but
i
cant
really
hold
that
against
it
because
this
is
a
delicious
beer
the
mouthfeel
has
a
bit
of
that
milkshake
thickness
from
the
wheat
with
a
prickly
carbonation
that
isnt
quite
spritzy
the
wheat
adds
good
body
for
this
sessionable
brew
drinkability
is
very
high
flavorful
very
hoppy
not
palatewrecking
though
intense
for
something
in
this
category
ill
go
ahead
and
call
it
a
good
thing
though
d
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
get
used
to
this
if
i
lived
where
this
was
distributed
great
sessionable
beer
overall
the
gumballhead
drinks
like
some
kind
of
hybrid
between
a
wheat
ale
and
an
american
pale
ale
the
hop
flavor
and
aroma
dont
overpower
though
but
merely
makes
you
stop
and
think
about
what
you
are
drinking
d
this
just
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
for
me
way
to
light
tasting
it
is
nice
and
refreshing
but
definitely
want
more
flavor
md
light
bodied
good
hearty
carbonation
make
this
beer
one
that
would
be
great
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
one
of
the
tastier
wheat
beers
ive
had
truely
enjoyed
d
this
is
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
hops
are
crisp
and
bitter
sitting
on
top
of
soft
malt
flavors
the
nice
lemony
touches
really
round
things
out
extremely
smooth
and
easy
drinking
goes
down
as
easy
as
water
perfect
craft
beer
for
spring
yard
work
excellent
definitely
a
beer
to
pour
cold
into
a
cold
glass
on
a
hot
day
i
dare
say
it
is
the
most
refreshing
beer
i
have
ever
experienced
d
i
rated
this
beer
as
a
session
beer
and
it
would
make
a
wonderful
one
at
that
citrus
and
yeast
make
this
beer
a
wonderful
beer
for
the
summer
time
great
job
fff
overall
a
pleasant
take
on
an
american
wheat
beer
god
light
citrus
and
hop
flavor
plays
well
with
the
wheat
malt
i
really
enjoy
the
use
of
amarillo
hops
notes
i
wish
fff
distributed
here
because
i
would
consider
keeping
this
in
my
fridge
all
the
time
do
wheats
generally
arent
my
favorite
but
i
could
definitely
imbibe
on
this
and
only
this
on
a
summer
night
in
the
nottodistant
future
will
drink
again
thanks
for
the
beer
john
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
it
made
it
to
new
york
thank
god
i
travel
for
work
and
i
will
pick
this
up
for
then
and
now
everytime
i
am
in
chi
town
d
incredibly
refreshing
remarkably
crisp
and
clean
throughout
a
superb
pale
wheat
ale
that
i
look
forward
to
diving
into
this
summer
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
well
made
wheat
beer
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
ton
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
hell
i
would
drink
this
beer
anytime
of
the
year
very
refreshing
d
very
drinkable
like
i
said
would
never
leave
but
to
get
more

3
floyds
always
a
quality
brew
d
a
very
unique
wheat
beer
that
exhibits
a
lot
of
creativity
in
my
opinion
gumballhead
succeeds
because
of
its
high
drinkability
and
because
even
though
the
flavors
are
quite
experimental
they
work
well
and
are
not
overpowering
worth
seeking
out
though
im
not
sure
how
im
gonna
get
my
hands
on
another
of

drinkability
is
off
the
charts
you
simply
must
find
this
stuff
for
yourself
summer
officially
starts
the
21st
of
this
month
june
so
stock
up
for
the
lawnmower
season
youll
be
glad
you
did
talk
about
getting
run
over
with
amarillo
hops
for
this
style
very
hoppy
and
very
nice
pours
very
pale
gold
in
color
clear
too
thin
head
that
receded
fairly
quickly
but
lots
of
stringy
lace
aroma
is
all
hops
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
the
boiling
hops
in
my
kettle
when
i
homebrew
taste
is
more
of
the
same
cut
grass
hops
but
with
a
nice
and
sweet
malt
backbone
to
the
beer
to
provide
some
balance
some
pine
some
light
citrus
cant
find
any
of
the
wheat
but
i
almost
prefer
not
to
find
any
fairly
well
carbonated
very
crisp
with
a
light
bodynot
thin
but
light
on
the
tongue
at
first
was
not
prepared
for
the
hops
but
it
quickly
grew
on
me
drinkability
is
great
very
drinkable
beer
hell
of
a
hoppy
apa
with
some
wheat
hints
would
buy
this
again
loved
it
actually
score
is
based
on
it
being
listed
as
a
wheat
ale
and
me
being
generous
listed
as
a
apa
it
would
be
a
4
5
anyway
thanks
to
gimmehead
for
this
nice
miss
styled
beer
bottom
line
couldnt
find
much
of
the
wheat
flavor
it
is
a
monster
on
the
hops
if
you
like
hops
and
see
this
beerget
it
i
usuaully
shy
away
from
wheat
beers
i
just
personally
dont
like
them
too
much
but
damn
me
in
the
pants
if
i
am
not
buying
this
stuff
this
summer
light
enough
to
pass
off
on
novices
to
lure
them
to
the
dark
side
but
yet
definitely
interesting
enough
to
keep
the
beer
snob
sated
this
is
one
damn
fine
brew
note
on
tap
is
even
better
with
a
smoother
mouthfeel
and
much
fresher
grapefruity
hop
character
perfectly
clear
gold
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
quite
last
long
enough
the
smell
is
wonderful
lots
of
sweet
malt
and
fruity
wheat
smell
along
with
the
characteristic
amarillo
hops
smell
which
comes
off
as
sweet
citrusy
fruit
very
pungent
indeed
taste
is
at
first
a
very
nice
light
sweetness
from
the
malt
then
the
hops
take
over
and
give
this
more
citrus
flavor
than
any
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
except
when
a
server
decided
to
cram
an
orange
slice
into
my
blue
moon
for
some
reason
a
light
bitterness
is
in
the
finish
wow
this
is
refreshing
it
could
use
a
little
bit
more
carbonation
though
maybe
i
let
this
bottle
sit
for
a
bit
too
long
in
the
fridge
i
remember
it
being
better
on
tap
at
the
brewery
mouthfeel
is
wickedly
creamy
but
i
dont
know
if
my
lips
could
take
more
than
two
of
these
prosit
the
idea
is
interesting
and
i
realize
i
am
in
the
minority
here
so
try
it
and
form
your
own
opinion
comes
in
an
eyecatching
bomber
with
no
date
noted
anywhere
careful
not
to
disturb
the
sediment
the
beer
pours
golden
clear
and
with
a
thick
rocky
head
and
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
smell
is
wonderously
hoppyfloral
and
piney
primarily
but
a
little
citrus
as
well
taste
is
more
of
the
same
hops
upfront
with
a
nice
wheaty
backbone
and
a
somewhat
tart
citric
taste
in
the
middle
giving
way
to
a
quickly
fading
bitter
aftertaste
medium
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
makes
for
very
easy
drinking
this
is
unlike
any
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
in
a
stupendously
good
way
this
is
the
absolute
best
summer
brew
for
hopheads
that
ive
yet
come
across
slightly
tart
lemony
rustic
very
hoppy
i
found
the
hops
a
bit
overpowering
in
this
particular
beer
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
pour
full
dont
fear
the
yeast
what
a
refreshing
brew
gumballhead
has
summer
written
all
over
it
props
to
fff
pours
a
hazy
peach
with
a
thinner
head
than
expected
that
was
gone
pretty
quicklyoh
man
the
aromasloads
of
amarrilo
hops
give
it
a
big
piney
aroma
intermingled
with
some
citrus
and
clove
like
wheatinessman
what
a
combination
the
different
refreshing
flavors
of
this
beer
are
just
awesome
definent
hop
profile
of
grapefruit
and
pine
along
with
a
wheat
beer
lemon
and
spice
make
this
a
one
of
a
kind
damn
now
i
see
why
this
beer
is
so
highly
regarded
and
amarillo
hops
are
a
big
favorite
of
mine
pours
a
very
pale
golden
color
lots
of
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
make
up
the
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
pint
glass
smells
fruity
lemons
pineapple
passion
fruit
pine
needles
oranges
limes
all
rolled
into
one
sweet
scent
holy
amarillo
batman
if
youve
ever
hombrewed
with
amarillo
you
know
what
i
mean
taste
is
very
light
there
is
definitely
the
signiture
three
floyds
sweet
malt
backbone
but
it
is
subdued
due
to
the
wheat
the
hops
really
take
the
forefront
here
quite
the
amarillo
taste
basically
tastes
of
all
the
fruits
i
mentioned
above
plus
other
unnameable
tropic
fruits
moutfeel
is
so
light
and
fluffy
making
this
a
perfect
summer
beer
very
quaffable
without
taking
the
price
into
account
unique
as
hell
also
tasty
as
hell
this
3fs
offering
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
a
nice
sturdy
medium
off
white
head
decent
lacing
aroma
is
very
floral
like
walking
into
a
garden
theres
also
a
dry
grain
note
in
there
i
like
it
a
lot
taste
is
fruitier
and
wheatier
then
the
aroma
would
suggest
not
sweet
and
not
bitter
either
starts
out
with
that
wheat
characteristic
becomes
more
yeasty
and
fruitier
as
it
goes
along
then
finishes
with
an
herbal
dryness
quite
nice
body
is
medium
thicker
than
most
wheats
but
still
refreshing
another
great
3fs
beer
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
brian
boru
i
had
last
week
drinkability
the
drinkability
factor
is
strong
in
this
one
compelling
even
lets
all
have
some
crazy
cigarette
smoking
cat
beer
a
clean
pale
yellow
beer
has
a
big
foamy
white
head
some
lace
the
aroma
is
spicey
kinda
like
clove
mixed
with
hops
the
flavor
has
more
of
that
clove
hops
interplay
with
a
hint
of
yeast
in
the
background
this
is
one
the
best
tasting
american
wheat
beers
ive
had
d
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
summer
session
beer
it
has
the
great
hops
coming
through
and
a
nice
softness
from
the
wheat
that
gives
it
a
base
to
stand
on
when
i
see
this
on
the
shelves
i
know
summer
is
close
this
one
is
just
real
tasty
and
interesting
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
yet
another
generous
donation
from
buckeyenation
thanks
hmm
where
do
i
start
first
off
i
must
admit
that
i
was
a
fan
of
skin
graft
records
long
before
gumballhead
was
even
bottled
rob
syers
gumballhead
the
cat
and
mark
fisher
hot
satan
have
always
been
some
of
my
favorite
comic
book
superheroes
that
said
the
beer
itself
lives
up
to
its
name
the
beer
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
the
malted
wheat
the
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
the
smell
is
quite
citric
with
a
lemony
zest
to
it
and
also
reminds
me
a
little
of
tangerine
the
taste
is
more
balanced
definitely
has
those
signature
three
floyd
malts
which
remind
me
of
cotton
candy
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
a
wheat
ale
very
drinkable
though
for
the
price
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
a
b
v
notable
for
its
impressive
lace
and
sustained
head
retention
special
thanks
to
cmaruschak
the
beer
fills
the
glass
with
hazy
golden
goodness
topped
with
a
pillowy
2
inch
white
head
nice
yeasty
wheaty
aroma
with
banana
papaya
and
a
floral
hop
nose
fresh
and
sprightly
in
the
mouth
without
sacrificing
body
wheat
and
tropical
fruits
mostly
with
a
subtle
hoppiness
and
a
dash
of
lemon
on
the
finish
creamy
and
finely
carbonated
excessively
drinkable
i
must
admit
i
dont
normally
like
american
wheat
beers
but
this
is
outstanding
a
fine
example
i
would
try
it
again
if
i
had
access
this
puppy
is
well
crafted
oh
yeah
drinkability
is
really
good
certainly
a
unique
brew
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
no
head
and
little
lace
smells
of
citrus
and
pine
trees
taste
is
very
lemony
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
apricots
doesnt
have
any
of
the
clove
and
banana
taste
that
most
wheat
beers
seem
to
have
id
say
it
resembles
more
an
american
pale
ale
in
that
the
aroma
and
bittering
hops
hit
you
in
the
face
but
the
subtleties
of
the
wheat
do
come
through
extremely
drinkable
and
a
definitely
a
great
summer
brew
no
wonder
this
beer
is
so
sought
after
poured
a
slightly
hazy
medium
gold
with
very
little
head
and
almost
non
existant
lace
smells
of
aromatic
hops
and
some
slight
citrus
wheat
malt
taste
is
unique
for
an
american
wheat
that
is
to
say
it
is
more
heavily
hopped
than
the
typical
but
it
is
wonderful
a
very
crisp
clean
hop
presence
that
finishes
with
some
nice
lemony
overtones
it
does
not
leave
an
overwhelming
hop
aftertaste
i
am
not
a
hop
head
very
nicely
balanced
and
huge
drinkability
i
will
with
out
a
doubt
pick
up
some
more
for
the
summertime
an
excellent
brew
well
now
i
am
witnessing
perfection
it
is
in
a
glass
right
in
front
of
me
not
perfect
in
respect
to
beer
guidelines
or
style
specifications
its
just
friggin
perfect
believe
me
i
know
of
fffs
propensity
to
overhop
anything
that
travels
through
their
tanks
but
this
is
working
for
me
big
time
the
floral
and
piney
hoppiness
that
comes
out
of
this
beer
is
so
soft
and
matches
so
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
theres
also
touches
of
apricot
and
clover
honey
this
beer
is
very
light
in
color

pale
and
golden
with
a
slight
haziness
making
an
appearance
after
the
2nd
pour
due
to
the
rousing
of
the
yeast
the
initial
pour
and
tasting
was
from
a
perfectly
lucid
beer
the
wheat
malt
lays
a
perfectly
sweet
foundation
for
those
floral
gummy
hops
not
too
sweet
or
too
hoppy
by
any
means
any
bitterness
is
beaten
down
with
a
sweet
wheat
malt
stick
the
finish
is
clean
and
has
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
tang
it
seems
like
most
hefs
have
an
abundance
of
sourness
its
not
a
bad
thing
but
the
tempered
sourness
in
this
beer
along
with
the
hops
made
drinking
this
beer
an
extremely
enjoyable
experience
perfection
medium
body
though
the
hops
and
carbonation
tingle
the
tongue
and
it
goes
down
creamy
and
smooth
some
lingering
sweetness
andor
hop
bitterness
depending
on
the
swig
tasty
and
worth
another
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
an
obvious
summer
beer
but
i
just
happened
to
acquire
one
in
a
trade
thank
you
patyoda
while
this
may
not
have
been
the
freshest
sample
in
the
world
it
was
still
excellent
the
best
part
was
the
smell
but
id
have
to
say
the
initial
hop
bite
is
the
only
thing
that
turned
me
off
notes
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
i
dont
think
this
one
quite
fits
the
bill
it
seems
more
like
a
straight
up
apa
to
me
that
being
said
its
a
fabulous
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
good
stuff
thanks
for
the
bottle
rob
i
cracked
a
22oz
of
this
while
brewing
a
batch
of
belgian
trappist
ale
this
beer
is
so
freakin
cool
it
is
scary
the
whole
time
you
are
drinking
it
you
think
that
it
is
an
apa
but
then
you
switch
back
to
thinking
it
is
a
wheat
beer
the
hops
definatelymix
well
with
the
wheat
and
produces
a
wonderful
sweet
finish
the
appearance
is
golden
and
there
is
tiny
particles
of
pulp
freefloating
in
the
glass
i
had
some
spicy
chinese
while
drinking
this
and
it
was
a
perfect
compliment
this
beer
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
session
beers
that
i
have
had
and
by
the
way
the
label
is
so
badass
drinkability
if
i
had
easy
access
to
this
beer
i
would
have
a
case
on
hand
at
all
times
a
true
taste
experience
so
much
flavor
in
this
beer
thank
you
so
much
meathookjones
for
this
sample
truly
an
all
time
great
one
a
top
10
beer
for
me
an
easy
drink
with
lower
than
average
alcohol
just
a
great
taste
and
wonderful
grapefuit
aroma
the
wheat
some
nice
complementary
spice
and
beautifully
hopped
too
big
a
bottle
to
finish
on
my
own
but
i
can
drink
this
anywhere
anytime
medium
mouthfeel
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
peachamber
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
the
smell
was
fruity
and
aromatic
with
some
spice
and
peppery
hops
the
taste
was
spicy
and
hoppy
and
peppery
and
fruity
melon
with
hints
of
wheat
and
a
hoppy
finish
a
taste
like
no
other
american
wheat
beer
that
i
have
tried
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
hops
lingered
in
the
finish
this
was
a
very
nice
wheat
ale
this
beer
has
a
sturdy
astringent
backbone
sinewed
with
sweet
and
hearty
muscle
that
has
been
arrived
at
honestly
no
highaltitudehgh
treatments
here
i
drank
a
22oz
bomber
and
really
look
forward
to
the
next
this
is
not
a
wheat
beer
yeah
it
was
made
with
wheat
but
if
you
put
a
lemon
in
it
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
gave
you
a
black
eye
22
oz
bottle
this
one
was
aged
only
a
few
months
it
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dies
off
after
a
few
minutes
the
aroma
was
very
hoppy
some
kind
of
a
grapefruit
character
in
the
hops
the
flavor
is
quite
a
bit
hoppy
as
well
with
a
pine
feel
there
is
a
bit
of
malt
character
but
this
doesnt
really
fit
the
category
that
its
in
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
what
i
expected
on
draught
at
barleys
smokehouse
as
with
the
bottled
this
beer
definitely
does
not
fall
within
the
normal
the
definition
of
the
style
but
it
is
still
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
draught
version
is
a
golden
yellow
color
with
nice
effervescence
tiny
bubbles
the
head
is
medium
thin
milky
white
and
did
not
last
long
nice
aroma
of
floral
hops
wheat
and
a
touch
of
citrus
lightbodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
less
hops
in
the
flavor
than
in
the
nose
but
still
a
great
amount
there
is
also
a
nice
wheat
presence
along
with
some
lemon
and
grass
overall
the
wheat
overlaid
with
the
hops
texture
makes
this
pretty
close
to
the
perfect
summer
beer
for
me
i
will
enjoy
this
beer
as
long
as
it
is
around
well
fellow
ba
goz
was
kind
enough
to
share
a
bottle
of
this
with
us
yesterday
at
our
ba
fest
meeting
and
i
finally
got
to
try
some
this
is
the
least
wheat
beer
like
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
tried
but
the
aroma
seemed
pretty
consistent
with
what
can
be
expected
from
three
floyds
and
i
iike
that
abv
anyway
clear
golden
when
poured
no
head
i
didnt
see
any
in
anyone
elses
glass
either
heady
hop
aroma
full
of
spun
sugar
and
cinnamon
taste
wise
it
starts
out
as
a
typical
hoppy
3fs
i
am
thinking
about
dreadnaught
the
one
thing
that
reveals
its
wheat
moniker
in
my
opinion
is
that
it
finishes
light
as
opposed
to
bitter
or
syurpy
very
enjoyable
especially
if
you
appreciate
candied
hops
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
see
this
beer
on
the
shelf
please
try
one
if
you
want
more
hurry
back
because
i
understand
the
supply
is
limited
gumballhead
is
far
and
away
the
best
american
wheat
beer
ive
tried
it
had
just
the
right
balance
ive
got
one
left
and
i
doubt
it
will
survive
the
first
quarter
of
tonights
mnf
game
big
thanks
to
qarre
for
the
hookup
22oz
bomber
a
dreary
golden
color
with
a
fantastic
white
head
atop
that
refuses
to
die
the
aroma
is
powerful
complex
and
simply
put
great
just
a
touch
of
wheat
in
the
nose
yielding
more
of
a
piney
hop
aroma
and
fresh
citrus
fruits
this
is
a
wheat
beer
right
upon
sipping
it
i
am
reminded
of
this
fact
the
aroma
is
deceiving
from
the
flavor
and
i
must
say
i
did
expect
a
bit
more
complexity
in
the
taste
wheat
malts
and
a
pleasant
lingering
sweetness
are
the
story
here
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
crisp
and
extremely
refreshing
one
of
the
best
session
beers
ever
i
am
guessing
and
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
of
its
kind
very
impressive
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
out
to
a
bright
and
satin
colored
dark
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
moderate
head
the
aroma
is
wonderful
and
gives
of
hints
of
pine
wheat
and
citrus
the
taste
is
very
good
to
near
exceptional
it
starts
off
like
a
pale
ale
with
hints
of
pine
spruce
citrus
and
hops
and
weaves
its
way
into
honey
wheat
and
spice
ive
never
experienced
a
wheat
or
summer
beer
with
such
a
range
of
tastes
excellent
clear
golden
honeyed
the
head
came
and
went
quick
after
only
a
minute
there
was
just
a
bit
of
creamy
white
froth
in
a
ring
at
the
edges
and
a
slight
dusting
left
in
the
center
sharp
hoppy
and
sweetness
float
from
the
glass
juicyfruit
gum
and
grapefruit
as
an
aroma
hmmmm
such
an
interesting
taste
honey
taste
and
honey
feeling
sweet
and
wheaty
yet
hoppy
lemon
hard
candy
in
the
background
not
the
good
lemonhead
ones
the
crappy
ones
you
find
in
the
doctor
office
candydishes
my
dad
is
a
psychologist
i
know
them
ohtoowell
fills
your
mouth
with
a
medium
bodied
almost
smooth
but
not
really
creamy
texture
im
not
seeing
the
carbination
but
i
can
feel
it
a
bit
on
my
tongue
im
really
liking
this
one
great
session
such
good
flavors
and
like
i
said
interesting
the
body
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
nothing
is
too
overpowering
to
make
it
annoying
just
nice
and
yummy
big
froathy
white
head
leaves
a
scattered
islands
of
lace
as
it
slowly
to
a
thin
coating
transparent
straw
colored
beer
with
dozens
of
tiny
carbonation
streams
rising
from
the
bottom
beer
is
at
cellar
temp
and
there
is
a
mellow
bubblegum
flavor
to
the
beer
not
much
else
a
light
malt
base
nice
soft
mouthfeel
carries
the
flavor
to
the
tongue
resinous
hop
aroma
a
nice
tasting
simple
beer
thats
easy
drinking
i
mellow
taste
and
addictive
aftertaste
combined
with
the
awesome
body
make
this
brew
exceptionally
drinkable
an
interesting
unorthodox
approach
to
the
style
but
i
dont
find
this
to
be
all
that
different
from
loads
of
others
it
is
hoppier
no
doubt
but
whatever
the
hops
bring
they
take
away
equally
notes
of
lemon
and
other
citrus
fruits
very
very
very
drinkable
might
as
well
stick
to
3floyds
brews
right
i
am
lucky
enough
to
have
an
ample
supply
of
gumballhead
available
to
me
at
the
village
bottle
shop
in
lafayette
no
i
wont
complain
about
the
price
here
this
is
a
truly
great
brew
which
brings
me
pride
when
thinking
of
its
indiana
origins
it
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
magnificent
white
head
which
has
good
retention
aroma
is
nice
and
hoppy
very
citric
for
a
wheat
beer
finally
some
grassy
notes
seep
through
taste
is
extremely
well
balanced
a
little
bit
of
hoppiness
backed
up
by
some
nice
sweet
malt
flavors
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
if
only
i
had
the
money
to
make
this
my
session
beer
ok
i
did
complain
this
is
a
marvel
of
brewing
and
i
have
yet
to
have
anything
similiar
one
of
my
favorite
3floyds
beers
try
it
if
you
can
pours
golden
amber
with
a
white
head
thick
aroma
of
piney
hops
bubble
gum
lemony
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
papaya
and
pineapple
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
soft
straightforward
wheat
malt
upfront
some
caramel
flavors
emerge
also
bitterness
from
the
amarillo
hops
pops
about
about
midway
and
introduces
the
lone
piney
finish
excellent
the
hoppiness
for
a
wheat
beer
is
unique
and
fits
the
3fs
profile
to
a
tee
poured
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
august
schell
weiss
glass
copper
rust
in
color
with
a
moderate
sized
foamy
head
smells
mainly
of
hops
with
some
bubblegum
sweetness
taste
is
hop
dominant
with
a
sweet
carmel
flavor
that
is
very
reminiscent
of
bubblegum
aftertaste
is
very
dry
but
very
appealing
defintely
a
tribute
to
its
style
big
whiff
of
slightly
lemony
amarillo
hops
open
opening
light
copper
in
color
with
a
slightly
uneven
big
white
head
juicy
orange
hop
flavor
dominates
without
contributing
much
bitterness
slightly
piney
in
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
wheaty
tang
a
mild
sweetness
waxes
as
the
beer
warms
and
lingers
a
bit
in
the
aftertaste
quite
big
in
terms
of
flavor
but
fairly
light
in
the
mouth
a
terrifically
drinkable
summertime
ale
poured
a
clear
amber
with
a
whte
frothy
head
the
head
dissipated
relatively
shortly
which
was
disappointing
the
aroma
is
luxuriously
hoppy
with
hints
of
citrus
orange
rind
the
taste
starts
off
as
smooth
as
a
typical
american
wheat
then
goes
all
emeril
and
kicks
it
up
a
notch
with
a
stellar
yet
still
muted
and
balanced
hop
finish
the
malts
are
soft
and
easy
on
the
palate
and
then
the
hops
roll
in
to
town
like
a
biker
gang
trying
an
image
reconstruction
plan
this
is
a
great
summer
offering
from
three
floyds
and
if
it
were
distributed
down
here
i
would
buy
it
case
after
case
after
tasty
case
22oz
bomber
hazy
golden
delicious
apple
color
topped
with
a
bright
white
creamy
layer
of
foam
head
dissipates
rather
rapidly
to
nothing
sugary
sweet
citric
hop
aroma
and
not
much
else
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
crisp
level
of
carbonation
soft
bubblegum
and
sugarcoated
hop
cone
flavor
like
dreadnaught
in
the
juicy
hop
flavor
department
minus
all
the
bitterness
seems
wheat
beer
like
in
texture
only
finsishes
rather
crisp
and
amazingly
somewhat
dry
certainly
unique
i
tend
to
like
originals
and
i
tend
to
like
originals
done
well
even
more
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
isnt
constrained
to
a
specific
style
great
summertime
drinking
i
only
wish
it
were
cheaper
8
for
22oz
ouch
this
beer
is
awesome
really
refreshing
as
well
a
great
beer
to
have
with
lunch
lush
and
flavorful
but
a
few
of
them
wouldnt
knock
you
on
your
ass
i
only
wish
it
were
more
available
around
here
a
very
interesting
wheat
beer
refreshing
on
hot
days
but
packs
the
hop
dose
i
need
let
me
preface
this
review
by
saying
that
this
is
one
weird
beera
pale
wheat
ale
immediately
my
taste
buds
were
expecting
that
typical
wheat
beer
taste
but
they
were
totally
caught
off
guard
by
the
heavy
duty
hops
it
poured
a
deep
golden
color
slightly
hazy
with
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
left
tight
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
nearly
all
hopsit
smelled
entirely
of
grapefruit
some
black
pepper
and
a
slight
wheat
thing
happening
in
the
background
the
taste
was
all
hops
up
front
big
grapefruit
flavors
and
plenty
spicy
gently
sweet
delicate
wheat
flavors
come
through
ever
so
slightly
just
before
a
mellow
barely
bitter
aftertaste
sets
in
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
medium
carbonation
stuff
is
highly
drinkable
each
swallow
leaves
you
thirsting
for
another
gulp
good
interesting
stuff
never
had
a
wheat
beer
like
this
before
pours
with
a
hazy
orange
body
with
a
decent
head
can
smell
the
grapefruityness
of
the
hops
in
the
nose
but
what
a
taste
the
palate
is
almost
confused
the
mellow
wheatiness
on
the
front
with
the
grapefruitiness
of
the
hops
in
the
back
makes
for
a
very
good
beer
eminently
quaffable
with
a
lighter
mouthfeel
one
would
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
more
so
than
an
ale
highly
recommended
from
someone
who
is
not
a
hophead
i
got
one
bomber
in
trade
from
francisweizen
and
have
another
one
brought
from
chicago
by
southernbrew
gumballhead
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
brews
ive
ever
had
it
has
the
look
of
a
wheat
beer
light
hazy
and
fluffy
and
the
creamy
texture
of
a
wheat
beer
but
this
has
hops
lots
of
hops
the
citrussy
yeasty
wheat
character
is
there
too
but
those
delicious
hops
are
upfront
and
the
combination
is
perfection
if
this
is
dreadnaughts
little
brother
then
ol
dread
deserves
its
reputation
i
even
like
the
weirdo
cartoon
label
thumbs
up
pours
a
nice
pale
cloudy
golden
color
with
amber
hues
a
billowing
head
about
an
inch
and
a
half
high
rises
and
recedes
with
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
initial
aromas
are
wheaty
sweet
with
some
malts
and
a
nice
spicy
piney
hop
tone
the
flavor
of
this
beer
starts
off
initially
sweet
with
the
wheat
and
other
malts
giving
a
nice
bready
malty
and
wheat
flavoring
carbonation
to
this
beer
is
subtle
and
crisp
with
a
nice
light
body
to
match
and
an
almost
creamy
texture
to
it
following
the
wheat
and
malty
backbone
this
beer
shows
off
its
nice
hop
profile
with
some
citrusy
zing
a
bit
of
floral
notes
some
zesty
flavors
and
a
final
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
to
keep
things
in
check
a
little
caramel
like
flavors
sneak
there
way
in
towards
the
end
of
this
brew
also
overall
an
interesting
offering
from
three
floyds
thats
just
in
a
style
of
its
own
really
definetly
a
great
brew
for
the
summer
with
a
nice
hop
kick
to
any
of
the
hop
heads
out
there
that
needs
a
change
from
an
ipa
pours
a
light
amber
with
a
large
white
puffy
head
lots
of
carbonation
and
i
had
to
be
careful
to
pour
slowly
smell
is
a
bit
of
grain
and
wheat
followed
by
piney
hops
taste
is
at
first
one
of
a
nice
refreshing
wheat
but
the
amarillo
hops
then
sneak
in
and
turn
the
beer
into
a
little
hop
monkey
its
almost
like
two
beers
in
one
at
first
you
think
you
are
getting
a
wheat
ale
but
by
the
end
you
are
thinking
you
might
have
gotten
your
glass
switched
with
a
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
good
with
pretty
hardy
carbonation
but
for
this
beer
the
effervencene
works
drinkability
is
nice
as
well
as
one
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
quite
easily
might
be
a
bit
overpriced
and
it
would
be
nice
if
these
came
in
6
packs
over
all
i
nice
offering
ive
been
saving
this
one
for
my
week
with
my
best
friend
one
of
the
many
great
beers
waiting
for
us
both
beer
is
a
nice
light
golden
color
the
head
starts
out
strong
and
thick
about
one
finger
high
and
fades
a
thick
coating
around
the
glass
with
a
light
cover
over
the
top
of
the
beer
there
is
a
good
malt
and
hop
aroma
with
the
hops
being
more
prevalent
the
hops
hit
me
first
followed
by
a
sweetness
from
the
malt
finishing
with
a
second
coming
of
the
hops
overall
a
very
nice
flavor
combination
as
the
hops
dont
linger
too
long
but
just
enough
for
my
taste
the
beer
is
moderately
thick
but
not
offensively
so
there
is
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
burning
on
my
tongue
i
had
expected
more
with
the
bubbling
present
in
the
glass
i
am
highly
impressed
with
this
beer
and
would
actively
seek
it
out
like
i
had
to
trying
to
find
it
in
the
first
place
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
in
my
opinion
ive
been
waiting
for
almost
a
year
to
write
a
beer
review
and
tonight
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
gumballhead
would
be
fit
for
my
first
ive
recently
moved
to
chicago
from
connecticut
where
we
cannot
find
three
floyds
now
that
im
here
i
treat
myself
to
a
bomber
or
two
of
gumball
every
week
i
have
even
been
considering
driving
the
900
miles
back
home
so
that
i
could
stop
at
the
brewery
to
pick
up
a
keg
to
share
with
my
friends
at
almost
6
00
a
bottle
this
brew
isnt
cheap
but
like
they
say
you
get
what
you
pay
for
i
think
ive
found
my
favorite
beer
drinkability
my
wallet
thin
as
it
is
will
not
allow
me
to
drink
this
as
i
should
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
im
almost
angry
because
i
cant
get
more
of
this
except
by
shelling
out
8
for
a
bomber
the
sad
thing
is
its
so
good
i
know
ill
be
back
nice
light
mouthfeel
leaving
a
slight
coating
but
nothing
too
overpowering
very
enjoyable
drink
i
will
have
this
again
22
ounce
bottle
thanks
to
skidz
i
now
have
another
bottle
for
the
stash
so
i
can
rate
this
one
funky
looking
label
as
is
the
beer
i
might
add
but
damn
does
this
taste
good
poured
out
a
goldenorange
color
with
some
carbonation
visible
and
stays
with
you
until
the
end
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
when
youre
done
with
it
smell
is
mostly
hops
to
my
surprise
some
sweet
aromas
come
in
as
well
along
with
some
citrus
notes
that
you
can
taste
quite
a
bit
of
taste
is
where
its
at
hops
alone
with
some
pine
flavors
hit
the
palate
first
with
some
wheat
in
the
middle
and
finally
blends
in
with
some
grapefruit
like
flavors
in
the
end
and
lasts
into
the
aftertaste
these
just
blend
in
so
well
its
amazing
the
aftertaste
isnt
all
that
powerful
with
just
a
wheat
aftertaste
along
with
that
grapefruit
taste
it
just
makes
you
want
to
sip
more
and
more
a
damn
fine
brew
the
name
is
fitting
as
it
is
a
bit
reminiscent
of
gum
also
hoppy
for
a
wheat
beer
which
is
not
uncommon
for
us
versions
give
em
credit
for
doing
something
unique
and
definitely
worth
trying
overall
it
cant
hold
a
candle
to
the
real
thing
but
a
good
brew
nonetheless
thanks
to
the
beirreise
for
the
sample
drinkability
exceptional
i
could
drink
this
beer
year
round
but
this
is
a
wonderful
summer
ale
i
would
keep
this
stocked
in
my
fridge
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
to
virginia
to
get
it
a
unique
beer
unlike
anything
else
ive
tried
hops
alert
you
know
the
hops
are
in
the
glass
before
you
taste
it
i
tasted
flavors
of
apricots
lemons
and
yes
gumballs
if
you
ever
wondered
what
the
spawn
of
a
bavarian
hefeweizen
and
an
ipa
would
be
this
is
it
comments

big
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
sending
this
one
all
the
way
to
seattle
ive
found
a
new
standard
cloudy
amberorange
color
with
a
huge
creamy
head
that
leaves
a
thick
sticky
lacing
in
my
glass
hoppy
aroma
of
grapefruits
and
candy
flavors
of
pine
and
citrus
never
had
a
wheat
beer
taste
like
this
before
medium
body
with
a
somewhat
sticky
mouthfeel
finishes
bitter
three
floyds
has
hit
another
home
run
this
is
a
superb
wheat
beer
the
best
by
far
that
ive
ever
had
i
cant
imagine
a
more
delicious
more
easy
drinking
more
flatout
enjoyable
summer
seasonal
the
bomber
is
almost
gone
and
it
hasnt
taken
me
all
that
long
to
write
this
review
have
the
boys
at
3f
sold
their
souls
to
old
scratch
gumballhead
met
my
high
expectations
and
then
some
drinkability
not
all
wheat
beers
need
to
be
light
and
wimpy
a
nice
mix
of
a
pale
aleipa
and
a
wheat
ale
take
the
light
body
of
a
wheat
beer
and
chuck
in
the
small
scale
sensual
assault
of
hops
from
an
ipa
and
you
have
this
schweeeet
wow
probably
the
best
wheat
beer
in
the
world
i
have
no
idea
how
a
beer
like
this
can
be
so
well
hopped
and
still
manage
to
let
the
wheats
mellow
character
shine
through
but
somehow
3f
manages
it
im
glad
we
have
another
bottle
to
enjoy
and
if
and
when
3f
makes
it
to
western
pa
this
will
be
one
of
my
personal
favorites
22oz
bomber
poured
into
a
tulipstyle
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
a
little
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
fantastic
with
a
slight
bit
of
wheat
malt
hiding
behind
a
large
dose
of
fresh
citrus
hops
it
smells
like
a
wheaty
ipa
very
strong
aromas
the
taste
is
weird
in
that
it
starts
with
sharp
hops
on
the
tongue
and
ends
with
a
wheaty
finish
still
crisp
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
heavy
great
for
a
wheat
beer
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
too
at
only
4
8
a
great
summer
beer
the
appearance
is
decent
looks
like
a
hazier
version
of
your
average
macro
lager
there
is
a
decent
white
head
here
aroma
has
my
attention
its
sweet
full
of
citrousy
hop
aroma
almost
as
if
there
were
citric
acid
in
there
the
taste
is
quite
good
for
a
beer
that
is
not
too
strong
full
of
citrousy
flavors
mixed
with
the
usual
hefe
tropical
tastes
make
this
a
wiiner
initial
grainy
wheat
flavors
are
spruced
up
by
some
fruity
hops
ending
with
a
decently
bitter
fruity
aftertaste
this
one
actually
gets
more
complex
as
i
go
along
the
mouthfeel
comes
off
rather
thin
but
fluffy
at
times
drinkabilty
is
good
and
this
a
great
low
abv
session
brew
my
current
flavor
of
the
month
love
the
taste
and
love
the
low
abv
hazed
dark
auric
hue
thin
but
well
retained
cream
white

leaves
sparse
lace
pine
sap
and
lemon
atop
grainy
tart
wheat
with
a
splash
of
light
lovibond
caramel
malt
bubblegum
hints
clean
and
enticing
aromawise
flavor
is
a
facsimile
of
the
aroma
pine
dominates
although
theres
a
juicy
honeydew
melon
presence
that
melds
well
with
the
stately
wheat
presence
bitterness
is
well
above
the
norm
for
the
typically
insipid
style
and
is
within
range
for
an
apa
wheat
lends
a
slight
tartness
that
adds
to
the
impressive
thirst
quenching
nature
of
this
brew
not
deep
maltwise
nor
is
it
intended
to
be
the
assertive
hopping
has
elevated
what
would
be
a
prosaic
american
wheat
to
a
very
respectable
level
thinnish
in
mouthfeel
but
with
a
light
viscosity
that
feigns
richness
finishes
slightly
soapy
with
trace
lemon
pine
sol
hints
but
otherwise
squeaky
clean
american
wheats
have
their
limitations
and
gumballhead
overcomes
one
typical
banality
lack
of
any
noteable
hop
presence
any
other
alteration
would
have
overly
bastardized
the
style
it
retains
the
effortless
drinkability
of
american
wheats
yet
adds
savourability
truly
unique

extremely
drinkable
and

this
is
a
great
brew
as
it
stands
i
have
to
thank
jahred
and
his
messenger
incongruity
for
their
gallant
work
the
beer
relinquishes
all
ties
with
the
22
ounce
brown
bottle
and
takes
up
residence
in
my
special
wheat
beer
glass
a
limpid
amber
color
the
head
is
modest
in
size
creamy
in
texture
and
a
very
light
tan
color
as
it
dematerializes
the
lace
formed
is
a
thin
veil
to
hide
the
glass
nose
is
spicy
citrus
crisp
with
a
nice
underlying
floral
tone
very
fresh
and
clean
to
the
senses
the
start
is
a
light
to
the
taste
buds
feel
of
the
wheat
and
malted
grain
spun
sugar
sweet
the
top
is
fair
to
middling

its

finish
is
ineffable
in
its
acidity
with
the

their
spicy

the

desert
dry
and
long
lasting
another
fine
beer
from
a
fine
brewery
thanks
to
mikeys01
for
the
bottle
i
owe
you
bigtime
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
head
lots
of
hoppy
goodness
with
the
malt
almost
nonexistent
lovely
aroma
for
a
summer
brew
hops
dominate
but
dont
overpower
the
palate
wheat
malt
adds
nicely
to
the
finish
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
nicely
balanced
with
hops
first
and
what
malt
last
well
done
quickly
becoming
a
summer
fave
of
mine
glad
to
see
this
one
bottled
the
cloudy
light
gold
body
is
topped
by
a
nice
frothy
head
that
shrinks
back
to
a
nice
residual
that
laces
well
the
nose
is
full
of
fruit
fruit
and
more
more
fruit
from
the
excellent
hopping
normally
not
much
of
a
wheat
fan
i
found
this
beer
to
be
excellent
in
its
drinkability
being
light
and
refreshing
from
the
excellent
blend
of
ingredients
a
bit
pricey
but
well
worth
the
money
as
a
novelty
experience
to
be
savored
on
occasion
notes
good
beer
not
one
i
would
suggest
to
a
first
time
wheat
beer
drinker
simply
because
of
the
way
it
differs
greatly
from
others
in
the
category
nice
beer
for
the
price
i
am
rating
it
per
style
doesnt
measure
up
as
an
ipa
but
as
an
american
wheat
it
blows
things
out
of
the
water
for
the
style
of
american
wheat
ales
this
is
light
years
ahead
of
the
competition
i
would
surely
buy
it
often
but
the
price
8
a
bomber
is
a
bit
much
for
me
right
now
regardless
you
will
not
find
a
more
amenable
nonweizen
wheat
out
there
this
is
both
an
excellent
beer
and
a
disappointment
with
a
name
like
gumballhead
i
was
looking
for
huge
esters
but
instead
i
found
a
beer
that
proved
to
me
that
american
hops
dont
clash
hopelessly
with
wheat
beers
after
all
the
color
is
a
slightly
hazy
not
very
cloudy
at
all
dark
gold
topped
by
a
moderately
sized
white
head
the
aroma
pits
slight
esters
against
a
moderate
fresh
amarillo
aroma
over
freshbaked
bread
the
flavor
is
a
good
amount
of
crisp
wheatiness
livened
up
with
some
grapefruitjuniper
hops
making
a
very
crisp
very
refreshing
brew
this
is
imminently
drinkable
i
could
probably
drink
a
dozen
of
them
and
fall
over
dead
itd
be
interesting
to
see
the
same
grain
and
hop
recipe
fermented
on
real
bavarian
hefeweizen
yeast
instead
of
the
yeast
strain
they
used
here
22oz
bomber
bottle
with
an
odd
looking
comic
charecter
on
the
label
named
gumballhead
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
a
rocky
white
head
left
a
fantastic
lacing
on
the
glass
as
it
was
drank
aroma
is
hoppy
with
citrus
grapefruit
notes
as
well
as
mild
malts
flavor
is
definatly
wheat
heavy
with
a
nice
hoppy
kick
to
it
with
a
bit
of
lemon
detected
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
especially
for
a
wheatbeer
this
has
a
great
mouthfeel
i
will
definatly
be
picking
some
more
of
this
up
and
doing
some
research
to
see
what
gumballhead
did
to
have
such
a
great
beer
named
after
him
this
is
now
my
favorite
wheat
beer
but
i
think
of
it
as
a
sessionable
wheatipa
i
could
easily
suck
down
3
of
these
bombers
but
my
wallet
sure
wouldnt
like
me
for
it
served
from
a
22oz
bobmber
graced
with
some
interesting
artwork
of
a
punk
ass
cat
or
something
like
that
you
can
certainly
count
on
3f
for
interesting
labels
pours
out
a
bright
orange
color
with
just
a
hint
of
haze
and
wisps
of
swirling
white
head
nose
is
shockingly
hoppy
for
a
wheat
beer
smelling
like
a
citrus
orchard
at
picking
time
no
hint
of
bananas
here
slight
wheatiness
is
also
noticeable
in
the
aroma
very
clean
flavor
lightly
wheaty
and
loaded
with
amarillo
hop
flavor
highly
bitter
towards
the
finish
and
just
a
bit
lemony
and
sweet
definitely
different
nearly
perfectly
so
body
is
medium
but
light
enough
to
go
down
very
easily
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
summer
beer
quite
complex
for
a
wheat
beer
3f
does
an
excelent
job
with
the
hops
as
usual
mmmm
want
more
from
the
bomber
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
head
disappeared
quickly
there
was
a
great
amount
of
lace
on
the
glass
what
a
smell
huge
notes
of
pine
and
citrus
sort
of
like
a
grapefruit
crossed
with
a
christmas
tree
on
closer
inspection
it
almost
smells
like
a
handful
of
what
else
gumballs
the
taste
begins
very
briefly
with
a
good
wheat
sourness
however
that
is
quickly
interrupted
by
hops
hops
and
more
hops
again
grapefruit
and
pine
flavored
hops
with
a
great
but
not
overwhelming
amount
of
bitterness
several
times
i
swear
i
could
faintly
taste
crunchberries
this
is
a
wheat
beer
oh
yes
3
floyds
means
hops
light
to
medium
body
with
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
wow
i
would
certainly
have
another
i
would
never
have
thought
that
a
wheat
ale
would
be
this
intense
but
it
is
and
it
works
great
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
its
got
a
big
lotta
wheat
with
a
raft
of
amarillo
to
match
and
they
balance
and
blend
to
offer
up
loads
of
sassy
refreshment
earthy
and
fruity
and
spicy
its
playfulness
captures
the
imagination
as
the
tidier
parts
pull
together
to
deliver
a
big
sum
total
and
that
in
turn
yields
some
truly
impressive
drinkability
if
the
name
and
the
label
put
a
grin
on
your
face
then
the
beer
itself
will
turn
that
grin
in
to
one
full
satisfied
smile
at
2
75
per
bomber
for
now
at
least
i
will
load
up
the
fridge
for
the
coming
months
kudos
to
3f
for
another
winner
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
style
wheat
beers
out
there
appearance
honey
golden

a
huge
massive

big

very
resilient

heavy

aroma
amazing
absolutely
one
of
the
most
pleasant
and
alluring
hop
profiles
ive
ever
come
across
from
an
american
wheat
ale
who
could
have
guessed
that
deep
buttery
pinecone
scented
hops
as
the
label
describes
loads
of
amarillo
hops
with
a
touch
of
banana
ester
man
this
hop
profile
is
kickin
taste
heavenly
layer
upon
layer
of
this
orgy
of
wheat
vanilla
and
banana
along
with
such
a
generous
helping
of
amarillo
hops
really
hoppy
flavored
yet
not
that
bitter
extremely
balanced
its
easy
to
say
theres
no
other
beer
drinking
experience
like
this
out
there
mouthfeel
creamy
silky
yet
rediculously
smooth
going
down
medium
bodied
with
an
even

a
pure

nectar
drinkability
a
dream
come
true
for
people
who
love
both
hoppy
beers
and
wheat
infused
ales
if
you
dont
like
american
wheats
give
this
a
try
nothing
like
any
other
example
of
the
style
let
me
thank
crjmellor
for
this
beauty
ive
been
salivating
to
try
this
one
drinkability
is
enormously
high
this
one
could
go
down
my
gullet
all
night
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
the
medium
body
is
packed
full
of
hops
and
will
give
anyone
craving
hops
their
fix
okay
we
in
columbus
finally
got
this
brew
and
as
is
often
the
case
with
three
floyds
i
am
somewhat
confused
if
pleasantly
this
beer
poured
a
light
clear
golden
color
and
fomred
a
small
off
white
head
the
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
hops
citrus
caramel
some
hint
of
pine
and
more
hops
a
flavor
of
hops
citrus
pine
and
more
hops
the
finish
was
bittersweet
and
refreshing
as
you
can
see
by
my
review
i
was
not
expecting
such
hop
influence
in
a
supposedly
wheat
beer
but
like
so
many
other
american
craft
brewers
three
floyds
continues
to
surprise
me
this
is
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
orange
colour
with
a
nice
head
of
white
foam
that
lasts
and
lasts
the
aromas
are
of
gumballs
other
german
yeast
notes
such
as
bananas
cloves
grapes
etc
fresh
citrus
hops
and
lovely
bready
malts
the
taste
is
absolutely
awesome
as
this
is
a
very
flavorful
blend
of
strong
hopping
and
delicate
yeast
play
at
4
8
this
beer
is
one
of
the
most
complex
wheat
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
sharp
and
the
drinkability
is
stellar
fffs
does
it
again
pours
a
clear
straw
gold
with
a
tight
white
head
that
sits
on
top
of
a
clear
straw
colored
brew
the
amarillo
aroma
is
just
wonderful
a
citrisy
spicy
flavor
accompanies
a
grainy
maltiness
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
and
crisp
with
the
amarillo
featured
in
the
end
a
great
warm
weather
drinker
it
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
with
a
head
that
dissipates
fast
the
head
is
a
dissappointment
for
a
wheat
beer
but
ill
get
over
it
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
some
cirtus
and
pine
and
a
wheat
tinge
the
crisp
body
does
not
have
much
malt
taste
but
some
sweet
breadiness
is
detectable
and
there
is
also
a
touch
of
bubblegum
the
hops
fesh
hop
flavors
are
excellent
there
is
lemongrapefruit
juiciness
and
some
pine
it
is
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
clean
finish
if
this
was
6
for
a
6pack
as
opposed
to
a
single
bomber
id
drink
a
whole
shitload
of
it
during
the
summer
but
as
is
it
seems
like
a
rather
rotten
deal
aside
from
getting
to
try
it
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
and
at
4
8
what
a
great
session
beer
it
makes
thanks
to
jackndanbif
6
for
the
bomber
i
said
god
damn
god
damn
what
have
we
here
its
a
wheat
it
is
spectacular
poured
this
bad
boy
into
a
glass
it
was
cloudy
straw
colored
held
a
perfect
white
bubbly
head
holy
crap
the
aroma
is
a
regular
thing
of
beauty
when
3
floyds
writes
that
they
add
a
boatload
of
amarillo
hops
on
the
bottles
label
they
are
telling
the
truth
every
sip
is
better
than
the
one
before
it
hops
are
everywhere
but
the
wheat
flavor
is
still
there
to
keep
this
brew
clean
refreshing
the
hop
profile
is
wonderful
floral
citrus
fruit
lemon
orange
grapefruit
drinkability
is
absurd
if
possible
i
would
drink
this
for
breakfast
lunch
dinner
for
the
months
of
april
through
august
for
the
rest
of
my
life
to
quote
andre
3000
i
think
im
in
love
again
ng
slightly
hazed
dark
golden
light
amber
appearance
thin
dirty
white
head
leaves
some
ample
lace
the
first
thing
that
hits
my
nose
is
that
sweet
resiny
canabislike
aroma
that
i
love
so
much
all
about
the
rillos
but
theres
also
a
little
spiciness
to
the
nose
and
a
little
wheat
tang
now
this
is
my
kind
of
an
american
wheat
the
pine
sap
burnt
citric
tones
of
the
hops
blend
with
some
bubblegum
esters
and
wheat
spiciness
to
create
one
enjoyable
beer
the
dichotomy
of
the
lingering
sweet
bubblegum
and
bitter
rillos
makes
for
a
nice
interplay
nicely
carbonated
and
about
mediumfull
in
body
im
liking
3
floyds
more
and
more
by
the
minute
now
that
im
not
tasting
the
contract
brewed
stuff
a
hazy
deep
amberorange
body
reveals
golden
highlights
at
the
base
of
the
glass
and
teems
with
tiny
effervescent
bubbles
the
offwhite
head
is
full
and
densely
creamy
and
displays
excellent
retention
and
leaves
wide
swatches
of
lacing
about
the
glass
the
nose
is
loaded
with
bright
fresh
hops
that
are
citrusy
and
lightly
spicy
with
hints
of
pine
over
a
delicately
sweet
wheatish
malt
the
body
is
medium
and
its
lightly
zesty
effervescence
leaves
a
lingering
tingle
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
as
the
rest
of
the
beer
fades
smoothly
away
with
a
light
creaminess
the
hops
displayed
in
the
nose
are
clearly
carried
over
into
the
flavor
dominating
upfront
but
blending
most
exquisitely
across
the
middle
in
a
wash
of
sweetish
wheataccented
malt
the
bitterness
is
held
in
check
as
it
should
be
20
ibus
perhaps
yet
the
hop
aromas
and
flavors
shine
it
finishes
with
some
lingering
malt
sugar
and
piney
and
spicy
hops
that
fade
to
a
dull
residual
bitterness
by
the
time
youre
ready
for
another
sip
an
extraordinary
american
wheat
thats
well
worth
seeking
out
props
to
cretemixer
for
delivering
this
to
my
door
pours
an
golden
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
and
good
lacing
smells
overwhelmingly
of
citrus
fruits
lemons
and
a
sweet
swide
round
out
the
smells
taste
is
nice
starts
with
a
nice
citrusy
punch
that
comes
around
with
a
sweeter
malty
finish
the
wheat
in
here
is
slightly
masked
by
overwhelming
hops
flavors
its
a
very
well
rounded
drinkable
beer
and
i
should
have
assumed
an
overhopped
hefe
from
3floyds
its
a
very
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
its
medium
bodied
a
pretty
good
ammount
of
carbonation
but
it
just
goes
down
so
damn
smooth
its
crazy
great
beer
by
a
great
brewery
drinkability
is
insane
one
bottle
was
not
enough
it
is
so
good
i
and
low
abv
and
smoothness
makes
me
just
want
to
drink
this
all
afternoon
on
the
back
porch
summer
beer
of
the
year
this
year
for
sure
very
good
and
very
drinkable
i
love
this
stuff
damned
if
oberon
is
in
the
same
league
faaagett
about
it
this
one
through
me
for
a
loop
for
sure
i
thought
it
would
be
more
of
a
belgium
white
ale
and
what
i
found
was
a
beer
with
a
very
unique
and
distinct
persona
the
beer
pours
a
wonderful
deep
golden
and
has
none
of
the
hazey
yeast
i
love
in
the
style
this
beer
throws
style
out
the
window
the
head
is
a
clean
creamy
buttery
white
aromas
are
super
fresh
and
hop
focused
an
orange
malt
aroma
adds
an
initial
summery
feel
and
once
in
the
mouth
the
beer
explodes
with
freshness
ahhh
what
a
flavor
spicy
citrusy
hoppy
grainy
smooth
and
again
ohh
so
fresh
as
the
beer
finishes
one
could
swear
that
all
the
complexities
of
this
beer
combine
to
actually
offer
the
taster
the
flavor
of
a
gumball
i
swear
it
the
flavor
of
the
sweet
shell
the
tang
of
the
fruity
gumball
and
the
bitter
of
the
gum
itself
this
is
a
one
of
a
kind
drink
cool
stuff
enjoyed
this
right
off
the
brewery
tap
this
is
quite
unlike
any
other
beer
out
there
american
wheats
are
a
little
bland
unless
theyve
been
brewed
with
the
spicy
flavor
of
german
wheats
but
the
floyds
never
cared
for
following
style
this
has
a
big
zesty
wheat
taste
that
i
somehow
guessed
was
north
dakota
winter
wheat
and
nick
said
i
was
right
but
i
dont
know
how
i
knew
like
with
most
3f
beers
theres
a
big
smack
in
the
face
of
hops
this
one
is
all
amarillo
giving
a
different
more
orangey
taste
pleasing
orange
color
too
gotta
get
out
and
find
this
stuff
while
its
around
pours
a
clear
deep
gold
color
and
it
is
topped
by
a
tan
head
a
wonderful
aroma
of
candied
fruit
rises
up
from
my
glass
the
aroma
definitely
lives
up
to
its
name
i
smell
notes
of
apricot
lemon
and
grapefruit
the
taste
is
light
bodied
and
slightly
sweet
and
thick
with
pungent
hop
flavors
a
clean
crisp
beer
hides
under
the
domination
hop
flavors
of
apricot
and
lemon
this
beer
is
not
overly
bitter
like
perhaps
the
hop
flavor
and
aroma
my
suggest
it
has
a
medium
level
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
definitely
know
of
no
gumball
that
is
quite
so
exquisite
as
this
elixir
this
is
a
damn
good
summer
offering
certainly
not
a
traditional
wheat
beer
but
the
wheat
lightens
this
beer
up
and
makes
it
a
great
summer
refresher
this
is
a
straight
forward
onedimensional
attack
of
amarillo
hops
if
you
like
them
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
on
tap
at
bw3s
downtown
indy
poured
a
clear
golden
orange
with
a
smallish
head
and
no
lacing
i
know
this
is
suppose
to
be
a
american
wheat
and
as
a
lover
of
wheat
beer
i
usually
dont
like
what
american
wheat
tastes
like
but
rating
this
as
a
stand
alone
beer
not
going
by
style
this
is
one
tasty
beer
from
the
moment
of
the
pour
you
get
that
big
hop
aroma
followed
by
the
bubble
gum
and
some
wheat
beer
characteristics
the
taste
starts
out
with
the
sweetness
from
the
malt
then
the
hops
kick
in
you
can
pick
up
a
little
banana
in
the
finish
very
good
a
great
session
beer
too
bad
this
is
seasonal
i
found
this
beer
to
be
fantastic
however
my
rating
for
this
one
is
not
comparing
the
beer
to
the
style
but
my
opinion
of
the
beer
itself
as
is
it
is
not
your
typical
hefe
if
at
all
id
call
it
an
ordinary
bitterweizen
the
smell
was
very
nice
with
good
malt
and
hop
aroma
and
a
touch
of
the
classic
weizen
yeast
esters
taste
was
a
blast
of
interesting
yet
delightful
flavors
starts
out
malty
sweet
with
a
balanced
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
gumball
flavors
actually
came
through
which
suprise
me
and
a
hint
of
banana
was
also
there
finish
was
smooth
with
a
good
overall
mouthfeel
nice
hoppy
finish
and
lingering
sweetness
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
this
brew
pours
a
small
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
white
colored
bubbles
and
a
weak
wheat
yellow
colored
body
it
had
a
mild
malthop
aroma
its
flavor
contained
the
typical
3
floyds
hop
bite
that
is
strong
initailly
yet
softens
in
the
finish
my
favorite
indiana
brewer
the
flavor
has
just
a
touch
of
the
wheat
sweetness
and
very
little
malt
to
cut
through
the
intense
citrus
hop
burn
towards
the
end
a
strong
taste
of
bubble
gum
yes
i
imagine
this
is
part
of
the
name
comes
in
to
rescue
the
taste
buds
from
a
neverending
load
of
hop
bitterness
this
beer
was
advertised
to
me
as
a
summer
pale
and
i
really
wouldnt
have
known
it
was
a
wheat
beer
unless
i
did
some
additional
research
this
one
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
miniscule
head
from
the
tap
lacing
is
not
present
smell
is
that
of
an
american
ipa
not
a
typical
wheat
beer
this
alone
tells
you
this
is
a
three
floyds
product
i
love
it
big
notes
of
fruity
hops
are
present
along
with
a
sweet
gumball
aroma
taste
is
a
great
balance
between
sweet
and
hoppy
with
the
hoppiness
winning
out
mouthfeel
is
mildly
carbonated
and
pleasant
this
is
an
incredibly
refreshing
brew
and
one
i
wish
three
floyds
bottled
hopefully
they
will
sometime
soon
going
along
with
the
typical
three
floyds
mantra
of
were
not
normal
they
pull
through
once
again
with
this
unique
offering
very
nice
great
looking
beer
lots
of
citrus
orange
zest
creates
an
awkward
aftertaste
o
a
decent
beer
that
might
be
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
to
be
sessionable
even
tho
the
abv
states
otherwise
but
doable
the
orange
taste
kinda
reminds
me
of
tang
looks
nice
smells
ok
above
average
beer
but
nothing
to
search
for
sounds
like
my
experience
at
summerfest
listening
to
rodrigo
y
gabriela
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
orangebrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
rind
very
mild
caramel
and
a
twinge
of
pine
resin
the
taste
mostly
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
resin
mixes
with
the
rind
in
a
strange
way
creating
a
strong
bitterness
that
ruins
a
lot
of
the
synergy
between
the
cracked
wheat
and
citrus
characters
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
bitterness
offsets
any
enjoyable
fruitiness
and
overpowers
any
hope
of
balance
its
not
terrible
but
ill
likely
never
have
this
stuff
again
overall
this
was
a
pretty
solid
pale
wheat
with
orange
zest
certainly
contributing
to
the
flavor
enjoyable
and
pretty
unique
would
imagine
fresh
is
best
but
this
turned
into
an
orange
soda
inspired
wheat
beer
and
the
subtle
bitterness
kept
me
interested
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
oranges
some
wheat
taste
is
wheat
oranges
some
tartness
decent
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
o
i
dont
eat
sugar
cereal
anymore
but
this
is
nostalgic
every
once
in
a
while
a
fun
one
overall
a
quite
tasty
and
easy
drinking
kind
of
like
sucking
on
an
orange
peel
in
a
good
way
o
itesting
ipa
straight
marmalade
o
3
5
i
like
this
for
what
it
is
thinking
outside
the
box
but
still
keeping
it
simple
ill
probably
try
this
again
next
summer
super
floral
really
wellcrafted
certainly
worth
picking
up
a
sixer
its
definitely
more
on
the
sessiony
side
but
it
does
not
come
up
short
in
the
flavor
category
whatsoever
4
hands
brewing
contact
high
45
cracked
the
can
and
poured
into
my
stemless
wineglass
pours
hazy
copper
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
which
later
retreats
into
a
thin
cover
of
sudsy
foam
with
lacing
on
the
glass
heavy
citrus
aroma
from
the
orange
zest
and
hops
citrus
flavor
with
a
muted
but
apparent
hop
bitterness
nice
and
full
bodied
especially
for
5
abv
with
a
dry
finish
a
solid
summer
beer
that
isnt
available
in
my
area
but
would
reach
heavy
summer
rotation
if
it
was
rather
nice
worth
trying
poured
into
a
wine
glass
golden
hued
with
a
wisp
of
tight
white
head
smells
of
orange
and
flowers
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
very
floral
up
front
with
orange
zest
dominating
the
finish
light
and
crisp
although
slightly
under
carbed
a
nice
summer
beer
for
sure
wheat
orange
zest
just
didnt
work
well
enough
for
me
to
break
into
even
a
mild
lather
decent
light
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
offering
that
will
work
well
in
the
summer
rotation
4
hands
is
putting
out
some
good
stuff
and
canning
is
an
added
plus
dark

light
copper
in
color
with
a
quarter
inch
thick
light
white
foam
cap
resting
on
top
citrus
hop
and
orange
aroma
the
flavor
is
fresh
pungent
citrus
hops
and
pale
wheat
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
the
hop
bitterness
pricks
my
tongue
this
is
likely
dry
hopped
very
orange
forward
in
the

slightly
sweet

candy
orange

taste
is
similar

presence
wheaty
lightness
body
is
fairly
light
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
would
look
for
this
one
again
overall
i
think
four
hands
has
done
something
wonderful
here
and
this
will
be
my
summer
drink
of
choice
o
this
was
ok
the
adjunct
made
the
beer
worse
in
my
opinion
overall
a
solid
pale
wheat
ale
and
one
that
ill
likely
get
again
not
sure
its
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
hoppy
wheat
beers
that
seem
to
becoming
very
popular
but
it
was
light
and
refreshing
and
probably
worth
another
go
since
its
pretty
easy
to
get
around
here
o
very
light
and
lots
of
orange
zest
pours
a
murky
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
much
better
citrus
hop
smell
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
would
drink
again
overall
a
decent
beer
with
a
noticeable
hop
presence
that
is
not
overpowering
another
huge
hit
from
4
hands
keep
em
coming
o
very
refreshing
and
great
for
this
style
nice
aftertaste
and
good
balance
overall
tasty
and
definitely
a
warmer
weather
style
well
if
this
is
a
wheat
which
im
sure
it
is
the
hops
certainly
have
taken
over
things
spiced
up
from
it
beyond
where
wheat
characteristics
can
shine
full
and
frothy
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
sure
but
standing
as
a
wheat
ale
it
doesnt
really
fit
to
style
o
one
of
the
better
summer
brews
of
the
season
love
these
hoppy
wheats
that
have
popped
up
here
and
there
this
does
not
disappoint
wellcrafted
overall
a
very
wellconstructed
hoppy
wheat
rarely
do
i
seek
out
the
style
but
this
one
is
for
real
pours
a
pale
orangeish
yellow
with
a
very
lively
head
upon
the
pour
that
retains
nicely
the
smell
features
nice
bready
wheat
malts
paired
with
big
orange
citrus
character
notes
of
lemon
pine
and
grapefruit
interplay
nicely
with
cereal
grains
and
bread
taste
is
very
fruity
up
front
with
notes
of
orange
zest
and
pine
heavy
hop
bitterness
starts
and
finishes
the
flavor
with
sturdy
wheat
profile
in
the
middle
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
overall
a
very
refreshing
hoppy
wheat
beer
worth
a
try
for
sure
overall
a
very
solid
summer
ale
one
id
drink
regularly
if
i
could
its
a
nice
hoppy
wheat
that
drinks
easy
id
imagine
this
to
be
a
good
summer
lawnmower
beer
i
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
body
and
pronounced
flavor
to
it
yep
ill
have
another
tasty
indeed
pretty
good
brew
it
seems
like
they
have
perfected
this
hop
profile
and
vary
it
between
their
dipa
ipa
and
apa
and
know
utilize
it
for
this
wheat
ale
nice
job

somewhat

taste
is

mildly

bready

a

mouthfeel
is
light

with
with

crisp
but
not
clean
leaving
a
phenolic
presence
on

this
is
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
very
easy
to
drink
the
taste
is
sooth
with
an
overwhelming
drinkability
lightly
carbonated
and
pours
with
a
small
head
this
is
a
must
try
if
anchor
products
are
available
in
your
neighborhood
golden
color
with
a
light
crisp
body
smells
of
citrus
lemon
and
wheat
prep
you
for
eh
not
much
theres
not
much
going
on
with
this
beer
a
good
summer
session
beer
that
could
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
i
could
think
of
better
options
a
real
disappointment
from
anchor
here
particularly
given
the
reputation
of
the
brewery
and
my
past
experiences
with
them
with
this
one
being
forgettable
in
almost
ever
area
not
to
mention
boring
and
bland
as
well
both
the
taste
and
smell
seemed
far
to
weak
and
featured
too
much
skunk
to
make
them
enjoyable
that
couple
with
the
relatively
poor
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
beer
i
cant
recommend
at
all
rating
c
tastes
more
like
a
lager
o
pretty
good
beer
for
a
wheat
i
do
not
like
wheat
beer
this
is
fairly
nice
and
probably
my
favorite
one
but
thats
not
saying
much
wont
buy
again
but
glad
i
tried
it
it
has
the
medium
full
body
and
mouthfeel
of
a
good
wheat
beer
with
above
average
carbonation
overall
what
a
terrific
wheat
beer
and
i
usually
dont
like
wheat
beers
but
this
one
is
really
terrific
i
really
love
the
strong
flavors
of
toasted
malt
and
wheat
balanced
well
with
some
subtle
sweetness
spicing
and
hops
highly
recommended
on
tap
from
bottle
from
the
tap
this
hits
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
funk
which
is
quickly
dispelled
once
it
hits
the
tongue
the
rich
looking
head
quickly
dissipated
leaving
an
intriguing
lacing
pattern
until
about
half
way
down
the
glass
the
body
is
the
most
noticeable
trait
thus
far
unlike
most
summer
brews
there
is
a
lack
of
the
crisp
citrus
character
so
ubiquitous
this
time
of
year
that
should
not
be
misconstrued
as
something
bad
it
can
when
all
is
said
done
be
a
distinction
as
long
as
it
has
a
purpose
in
this
case
it
seems
to
anchor
steam
in
my
mind
has
always
had
a
character
that
i
can
best
be
describe
as
a
fistful
of
flavor
the
heartiness
of
which
is
not
lost
in
this
venture
to
the
lighter
brighter
side
as
a
new
yorker
whose
summers
are
a
series
of
intermittent
hot
days
interdispersed
with
very
hot
days
this
would
be
great
on
the
merely
hot
days
synchronize
with
a
midcalifornian
moderate
clime
bottom
line
is
grab
some
if
its
warm
but
spare
it
if
its
hot
humid
but
if
you
like
robust
beer
no
matter
what
keep
it
on
the
list
now
on
to
the
bottled
effort
the
head
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
the
lacing
showed
up
virtually
other
aspects
corresponded
m
medium
carbonation
and
finishes
very
crisp
and
quite
sweet
o
a
better
history
lesson
than
an
actual
beer
all
it
has
going
for
it
is
drinkability
and
even
then
there
are
other
wheat
beers
id
much
rather
drink
without
a
doubt
this
is
my
least
favorite
brew
from
anchor
overall
a
fair
summer
beer
nothing
overly
complex
or
interesting
but
still
comes
off
as
a
decent
beer
o
a
nice
taste
of
history
marking
how
far
american
craft
brewing
has
come
so
much
like
an
aa
lager
with
a
few
tweaks
that
a
novice
wouldnt
pick
up
on
yet
this
was
supposedly
the
first
american
wheat
ale
in
the
modern
era
got
at
trader
joes
ashville
overall
this
is
a
picture
perfect
summer
brew
keeping
your
focus
on
friendly
conversations
with
others
instead
of
having
to
explain
flavors
to
non
craft
fans
im
definitely
a
fan
of
this
beer
its
not
a
heavyduty
beer
but
is
definitely
yummy
perhaps
its
that
im
a
fan
of
san
francalifornia
perhaps
not
i
do
like
the
taste
as
it
is
crisp
and
light
without
being
bland
this
is
the
second
time
ive
purchased
a
single
bottle
of
this
lovely
beer
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
sixpack
next
time
overall
my
beer
taste
changes
all
the
time
and
maybe
this
was
not
the
time
for
me
to
have
the
summer
beer
it
was
good
but
as
mentioned
before
nothing
to
write
home
about
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint

bottled
on

pours
slightly

bright

with
a

with
great

that
reduces
to
a
nice

that
lingers
nice

overall
this
is
a
nice
pale
wheat
ale
good
robustness
and
balance
of
pale
malt
earthy
hops
and
fruity
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
i
guess
you
could
say
that
a
lot
of
american
craft
breweries
muck
up
their
pale
wheat
ales
with
fruit
peels
chalky
spices
and
a
big
musty
yeast
this
is
a
minimalist
wheat
ale
at
its
finest
it
doesnt
really
hold
up
on
its
own
but
i
dont
think
the
brewers
at
anchor
care
too
much
about
that
kind
of
opinion
it
could
only
possibly
be
american
in
style
as
it
seems
theyre
giving
germany
and
belgium
a
great
big
middle
finger
from
way
way
way
across
the
pond
nevertheless
its
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
if
you
like
a
summer
beer
sixer
that
you
dont
want
to
stop
and
think
about
too
much
this
is
right
as
rain
for
you
this
is
actually
a
light
apa
with
some
wheat
that
further
smooths
the
brew
very
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
it
fits
well
its
purpose
a
sneaky
but
fresh
grassy
floral
hoppy
feel
balanced
well
by
a
fairly
strong
yeast
and
nice
malty
backbone
it
all
comes
together
pretty
well
in
a
refreshing
balanced
brew
this
beer
came
packaged
in
an
anchor
brewing
company
sampler
case
including
their
steam
porter
and
liberty
ale
and
is
labeled
as
their
wheat
beer
with
james
stitts
original
label
art
on
the
bottle
the
beer
itself
is
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
and
is
a
nice
surprise
to
me
there
is
definitely
a
nice
mix
of
wheat
and
barley
malts
which
provide
a
smooth
slightly
sweet
character
to
the
beer
the
yeast
does
a
nice
job
of
complementing
the
malts
by
providing
a
great
fruity
aroma
and
flavor
enhancement
ill
have
to
keep
this
one
in
mind
for
the
upcoming
hot
summer
days
although
american
pale
wheat
ales
do
not
represent
my
favorite
beer
style
i
am
a
fan
of
anchor
and
this
one
was
hard
to
pass
up
on
when
i
spied
it
on
a
pick
six
craft
beer
wall
pours
up
nicely
a
mountain
of
offwhite
thick
foam
on
top
of
a
golden
yellow
base
beer
does
look
a
bit
like
darkish
honey
or
less
pleasantly
concentrated
urine
but
hey
very
clean
spicy
wheat
and
old
world
earthyleafy
hop
aroma
brisk
and
assertive
carbonation
was
right
where
it
should
be
for
the
style
moderate
to
quite
fizzy
and
i
was
struck
by
the
smoothness
on
the
palate
almost
creamy
palate
features
very
pleasant
lemonlime
apricot
and
green
apple
characters
than
are
subtle
enough
but
add
complexity
nice
smooth
bitterness
with
white
peppertype
spice
notes
in
the
finish
this
beer
includes
the
underutilized
glacier
hop
and
perhaps
this
is
the
source
of
the
fruity
character
along
with
the
wheat
malt
minimal
pine
flavor
the
hops
are
more
grassy
earthy
and
refined
dry
and
crisp
overall
with
some
sour
fruit
character
and
the
unvarnished
clean
flavors
remind
me
a
bit
of
a
good
pilsener
i
am
perplexed
by
the
mediocre
ratings
this
beer
garners
on
this
website
perhaps
people
were
looking
for
more
aggressive
flavors
it
is
not
supposed
to
taste
like
a
hefeweizen
or
a
wheat
ipa
i
think
this
brew
is
right
where
it
needs
to
be
in
terms
of
the
wheat
and
hops
balance
refreshing
and
wellexecuted
draught
headkeeper
this
one
pours
a
crystal
clear
lighter
golden
color
there
was
a
very
small
white
head
on
it
and
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
ok
earthy
hops
some
malts
some

the
taste

a
good
summer
beer
purchased
in
a
bottle
from
a
supermarket
in
knoxville
tennesse
poured
into
a
pint
glass
of
course
very
light
beer
no
heavy
smell
and
no
aftertaste
nice
golden
color
with
very
little
carbonation
very
good
blonde
not
a
strong
beer
so
a
good
choice
with
heavy
meals
i
e
pizza
pasta
etc
will
try
again
opretty
one
dimensional
wheat
beer
overall
again
a
lot
of
people
arent
going
to
like
this
because
it
lacks
the
flavors
that
most
expect
from
the
typical
summer
ale
i
like
the
hops
in
this
one
and
i
think
theres
just
enough
of
them
to
balance
the
wheat
and
that
the
flavors
of
grass
and
bread
are
great
slightly
above
average
wheat
ale
not
bad
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
offerings
out
there
o
i
had
a
feeling
this
beer
was
going
to
exceed
my
expectations
and
it
did
has
the
balance
between
the
wheat
and
the
adjuncts
the
sweetness
and
tartness
great
brew
that
embodies
summer
o
nice
flavors
great
mouthfeel
nothing
exceptional
here
to
be
sure
but
an
easydrinker
that
i
enjoyed
very
much
on
a
gorgeous
summer
day
d
definitely
the
least
enjoyable
anchor
brew
ive
tried
so
far
the
first
3
were
all
outstanding
but
this
one
just
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
runofthemill
summer
patio
sipper
with
a
craft
twist
on
it
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
average
picked
up
a
single
anchor
summer
outta
the
cold
box
because
the
sixer
i
was
buying
was
warm
and
i
needed
something
to
break
the
spell
of
baltimores
summer
sun
im
pleased
i
dont
have
five
more
of
these
to
imbibe
because
one
is
quite
enough
the
shape
of
the
bottle
and
the
design
of
the
label
are
superior
to
the
beverage
contained
within
im
afraid
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
poured
a
light
golden
color
pretty
clear
small
white
head
that
didnt
stay
long
smells
of
lemon
grain
light
citrus
taste
of
grassy
hops
some
citrus
wheat
light
malty
background
mouthfeel
was
lighter
side
but
still
well
balanced
overall
it
really
was
just
okay
but
is
an
easy
drinker
and
can
see
how
this
can
be
enjoyed
during
the
hot
summer
weather
i
am
surprised
by
okay
ranking
for
this
one
for
a
light
lowalcohol
wheat
ale
this
is
quite
a
flavorful
and
unique
flavor
profile
it
is
true
a
lot
of
breweries
have
made
some
excellent
wheat
beers
since
this
one
was
first
brewed
in
1984
this
one
is
still
quite
competitive
in
this
category
ideal
for
summer
refreshing
but
in
a
characterless
macro
lager
kinda
way
doesnt
go
for
weizen
character
but
doesnt
load
up
on
us
hops
either
and
not
as
creamy
as
id
expect
for
a
wheat
beer
this
style
can
be
done
so
much
better

a
soft

this
beer
did
not
taste
prickly
in
the
mouth
unusual
in
my
recent
tastings
wellcrafted
beer
bought
from
connollys
b91
england
a
refreshing
beer
on
a
summer
day
leading
up
to
our
bbq
pour
well
into
a
weizen
glass
and
developed
a
lot
of
head
with
a
good
yelloworange
color
coming
through
smelled
crisp
with
hints
of
citrus
tasted
clean
with
a
smooth
finish
will
definitely
be
having
another
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
sessionable
refreshing
tastes
like
a
good
belgian
wheat
thats
been
watered
down
a
little
nice
lemonycitrus
bite
would
be
very
refreshing
after
mowing
the
lawn
slightly
above
average
not
to
be
turned
down
judging
by
the
sweat
after
my
run
tonight
its
definitely
summer
now
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
lemon
peel
light
wheat
light
sweet
flowers
and
a
hint
of
what
may
or
may
not
be
coriander
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
ups
the
lemon
to
a
point
where
its
the
clear
star
making
for
a
fruity
breeze
of
a
drink
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
nice
little
hotweather
quaff
nothing
special
but
something
easily
drinkable
o
many
other
summer
beers
beat
this
one
flavor
was
not
right
for
me
very
clear
yellowamber
look
small
white
fluffy

with
some

taste
is
light
fluffy
airy
wheat
with
a
lemony
kick
of
hops
feel
is
light
finish
of
lingering
bitterness
overall
drinkability
not
a
great
beer
none
of
the
fruityyeasty
wheat
qualities
i
like
i
would
drink
this
again
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
pretty
average
tasting
beer
to
me
nothing
about
it
really
stood
out
it
is
pretty
drinkable
had
to
try
it
when
it
came
to
bottle
shop
tasted
almost
amberish
to
me
the
bottle
describes
it
as
being
very
crisp
but
i
didnt
get
that
experience
maybe
had
it
been
on
tap
its
on
the
more
bitter
side
for
a
summer
beer
tends
towards
a
german
pils
bitter
taste
overall
a
good
summer
beer
with
a
distinct
anchor
brewing
flavor
profile
i
never
did
taste
or
smell
the
wheat
aspect
which
is
fine
by
me
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
in
general
odamn
fine
session
beer
great
intro
to
craft
beers
for
budlight
lovers
bring
this
one
to
the
beach
or
the
barbeque
a
great
warmup
beer
before
the
big
guns
come
out
overall
theres
nothing
remarkable
about
this
beer
other
than
its
refreshing
and
drinkable
it
wouldve
been
cool
had
there
been
some
more
flavor
but
for
what
is
its
alright
this
is
a
rather
simple
beer
this
comes
across
as
a
microbrewers
answer
to
a
light
american
lager
it
has
a
mildly
grainy
taste
and
a
very
light
body
the
wheat
is
there
but
its
solo
with
nothing
to
support
it
this
isnt
a
beer
il
buy
again
im
kind
of
surprised
at
the
average
reviews
this
beer
is
getting
for
me
this
is
almost
exactly
what
i
want
in
a
summer
beer
clean
crisp
refreshing
but
not
lacking
in
complexity
or
general
taste
the
wheat
flavor
is
great
just
the
right
amount
the
finish
might
be
slightly
dry
but
overall
im
glad
to
add
this
to
my
summer
arsenal
overall
a
decently
refreshing
beer
if
not
a
perfect
one
the
floralperfumey
character
of
the
flavor
just
doesnt
suit
me
at
least
not
in
the
intensity
evident
here
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
readily
available
summer
session
ales
there
are
definitely
better
more
flavorful
versions
but
much
pricier
and
harder
to
track
down
nothing
revolutionary
just
very
balanced
and
drinkable
overall
an
ok
summer
style
ale
while
not
tons
of
flavor
it
is
a
good
for
sessions
with
pals
over
a
long
summer
night
as
it
is
light
and
refreshing
overall
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
by
anchor
clean
flavours
with
some
pleasant
toasted
characteristics
a
crisp
and
simple
brew
not
much
of
a
discernible
aroma
in
the
least
theres
a
slight
bitterness
veering
into
tartness
like
a
light
berlinerweiss
tang
not
a
heavy
hefewheat
beer
refreshing
crisp
smooth
effervescent
with
a
clear
flavor
that
cuts
through
a
meal
refreshing
and
perfectly
suited
for
summertime
o
not
an
exciting
summer
beer
and
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
reliable
anchor
steam
but
it
will
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
oaroma
and
appearance
are
really
nice
but
just
seems
to
be
lacking
everywhere
else
even
for
a
lighter
style
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
enough
structure
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
refreshing
light
body
moderately
carbonated
a
little
resin
from
the
hops
i
would
recommend
this
summer
beer
over
all
others
from
mainstream
breweries
o
certainly
one
of
the
easier
drinking
summer
beers
nice
and
light
with
enough
flavor
to
make
you
want
to
keep
drinking
nothing
offputting
and
a
solid
choice
for
a
refreshing
beer
pours
a
goldenstraw
color
with
a
halffinger
of
fizzy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
nose
is
akin
to
that
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
not
a
good
start
the
taste
is
fairly
light
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
quaffable
but
nothing
special
in
the
least
overall
this
beer
is
fine
its
good
for
the
summer
theres
just
not
much
to
it
honestly
im
not
offended
by
it
but
eh
from
the
bottle
marked
2aq
sampled
on
july
12
2012
the
color
is
an
excellent
looking
pale
to
golden
yellow
with
a
longlasting
softish
white
head
the
aroma
is
subtle
all
around
with
field
wheat
grains
bread
and
a
cleanliness
the
body
is
light
to
medium
the
taste
has
a
slightly
more
bitter
character
to
it
than
other
summers
and
little
in
the
way
of
citrus
also
there
is
a
short
lingering
finish
very
easy
to
drink
to
boot
owhile
cold
the
beer
is
decent
however
as
it
begins
to
warm
even
slightly
it
goes
down
hill
o
this
beer
is
refreshing
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
would
be
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
evening
o
i
dig
the
lemony
flavors
here
a
good
distraction
worthy
of
trying
at
least
once
overall
a
decent
summer
brew
not
a
personal
favorite
but
nothing
id
turn
down
if
offered
overall
i
dont
really
like
wheat
beers
in
general
but
do
enjoy
them
occasionally
in
the
summer
months
however
this
was
a
major
disappointment
but
it
might
be
due
to
the
more
hoppier
versions
i
have
become
used
to
notes
a
nice
job
for
a
summer
ale
the
summer
ale
market
is
big
so
this
is
not
king
just
a
good
contender
o
not
a
favorite
style
this
is
the
weakest
beer
ive
had
from
this
beloved
brewery
still
it
is
good
for
style
well
crafted
very
drinkable
and
rather
refreshing
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
a
grainy
aftertaste
a
mild
bitterness
mostly
a
little
sweetness
and
a
decent
malt
character
not
a
great
beer
but
drinkable
overall
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
i
am
not
usually
a
wheat
beer
drinker
but
this
one
is
very
good
i
like
that
this
beer
is
not
the
traditional
unfiltered
heavy
wheat
beer
to
i
come
to
expect
indeed
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
one
that
i
would
try
again
o
this
was
just
an
average
wheat
ale
nothing
stood
out
to
put
this
one
above
the
rest
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
o
very
enjoyable
summer
beer
everything
balances
well
and
all
of
the
flavors
and
light
and
crisp
great
job
by
the
anchor
brewers
the
taste
is
also
very
simple
there
is
some
grain
a
little
grassiness
and
a
light
mineral
taste
i
felt
that
it
was
very
drinkable
but
there
wasnt
much
there
not
bad
just
no
lasting
effect
overall
a
decent
if
unspectacular
wheat
ale
its
pretty
refreshing
but
i
dont
really
care
for
a
overly
dry
finish
pretty
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
and
decent
tasting
i
dig
it
the
body
is
nice
and
light
with
somewhat
soft
carbonation
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
i
can
see
myself
grabbing
this
again
good
lacing
decent
head
over
golden
carbonated
beer
smells
ok
malts
predominate
slightly
metallic
scent
sneaks
in
tastes
like
a
macro
beer
they
really
missed
the
mark
watery
metallic
artificial
light
enough
that
you
could
have
several
if
you
were
so
inclined
i
am
not
overall
a
pretty
nice
and
refreshing
summer
wheat
beer
nice
zesty
citrus
flavors
going
on
another
grest
nothing
earth
shattering
here
but
a
pretty
nice
brew
for
the
hot
months
smells
like
grassy
hops
light
tea
crackery
malt
palate
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
citrus
zest
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
with
more
malt
features
than
hop
features
its
got
a
sort
of
german
or
czech
pils
malt
profile
which
is
bigger
than
a
lot
of
summer
seasonals
floral
blooming
polleny
grassy
hops
are
very
crisp
and
seasonally
appropriate
o
the
tail
end
of
this
beer
feel
is
good
not
too
light
on
the
body
but
very
very
easy
drinking
refreshingly
robust
carbonation
and
a
quick
finish
this
is
a
nice
outside
slammer
for
the
summer
and
a
lot
less
boring
than
many
of
its
contemporaries
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
bubbly
though
the
beer
gets
a
little
bitter
when
it
warms
have
this
one
cold
t
very
light
and
pretty
refreshing
lots
of
wheat
and
pale
malt
throughout
with
a
bit
of
lemon
and
honey
sweetness
the
biggest
problem
for
me
was
a
lot
of
bready
malt
towards
the
finish
that
got
stronger
and
more
overpowering
as
the
beer
warmed
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
not
much
to
look
at
but
has
a
solid
nose
combo
of
grains
fruit
and
spice
flavor
is
full
fermented
grains
with
a
little
citrus
and
spice
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
if
i
didnt
know
what
style
this
was
i
would
have
guessed
it
to
be
some
sort
of
light
lager
not
a
bad
beer
but
bit
of
a
let
down
for
the
style
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
light
orange
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
rapidly
leaving
light
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
citrus
taste
is
light
caramel
malt
light
citrus
and
understated
wheat
light
and
refreshing
but
otherwise
unremarkable
o
just
a
so
so
wheat
beer
pretty
forgettable
i
would
imagine
if
i
had
tried
this
in
the
summer
in
the
heat
i
might
have
liked
it
more
if
i
can
find
it
again
this
summer
i
will
give
it
another
shot
as
i
am
a
fan
of
anchor
brews
but
in
the
winter
it
just
did
not
cut
it
m
light
bodied
crisp
and
thirstquenching
if
perhaps
a
wee
bit
overcarbonated
o
light
and
bright
shade
too
much
acidity
o
very
nice
beer
with
lemon
tones
throughout
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
very
refreshing
and
would
be
great
on
a
summer
day
d
session
session
session
i
may
have
gotten
into
this
one
a
little
late
into
the
season
which
may
explain
some
of
the
flavor
and
nose
dissipation
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
an
sf
summer
day
requires
a
little
bit
more
of
a
bite
though
picked
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
at
wegmans
i
love
the
stubby
bottle
the
head
was
super
fluffy
and
looked
great
typical
wheat
color
the
nose
was
more
wheat
than
usual
nice
lemony
flavor
but
hold
the
lemon
wedge
please
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
nice
combo
of
pale
ale
crispness
with
hearty
hefe
characteristics
just
in
time
for
the
end
of
summer
o
i
find
this
beer
to
be
average
its
a
pleasant
treat
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
do
not
feel
that
it
is
all
that
memorable
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
o
this
is
a
great
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
i
recommend
it
o
a
very
good
summer
wheat
beer
a
great
beer
to
kick
back
with
on
a
warm
summer
day
o
nicely
done
but
i
like
a
bigger
citrusy
hop
presence
in
an
apwa
overall
drinkability
surprisingly
quite
drinkable
for
a
shallow
flavor
profile
beer
but
maybe
thats
why
it
works
its
not
trying
too
hard
to
wow
you
its
not
amazing
its
just
very
drinkable
washes
food
down
quiet
well
i
think
this
would
be
great
with
seafood
and
went
well
with
a
blt
for
an
unofficial
end
of
summer
beer
on
labor
day
i
think
it
would
definitely
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
as
well
rjt
ok
brew
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
light
and
citrusy
with
about
as
much
flavor
as
the
steam
coming
off
an
anchor
not
much
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
for
when
you
are
taking
a
summer
vacation
from
taste
wheaty
and
mildly
malty
with
some
lemon
notes
light
on
the
mouthfeel
drinkable
at
least
easy
to
pound
or
funnel
marginal
showing
from
a
decent
brewery
beer
poured
with
a
large
frothy
head
and
darklike
gold
color
aromas
were
slightly
strong
with
some
cloves
malts
and
wheat
the
taste
is
really
enjoyable
and
bittersweet
the
malt
and
bready
balance
leaves
a
bitter
flavor
at
the
end
which
is
nice
and
refreshing
along
with
a
good
solid
body
the
beer
is
a
wonderful
wheat
ale
overall
i
think
its
very
well
made
and
a
great
easy
drinking
summer
beer
it
could
use
a
little
more
character
but
its
subtleties
and
simplicity
are
very
enjoyable
o
nice
brew
i
find
it
delicious
actually
nice
beer
to
get
the
night
started
since
its
so
refreshing
ill
definitely
be
back
for
more
next
summer
overall
its
refreshing
enough
to
be
a
decent
summer
despite
the
generally
below
average
scores
i
gave
it
id
have
it
again
this
would
be
suitable
for
a
scorching
hot
day
but
even
then
i
can
think
of
many
beers
i
would
prefer
to
this
i
dont
see
myself
having
this
one
again
had
a
pint
at
batdorfs
in
annville
this
is
a
basic
clean
american
wheat
boring
but
refreshing
there
was
a
very
mild
wheat
and
pale
barley
taste
with
no
real
discernible
hops
character
its
on
the
mark
for
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
order
this
again
not
a
terrible
beer
overall
but
not
great
by
any
means
i
wouldnt
go
back
to
this
one
dr
low
abv
fair
drinkability
and
low
quality
make
this
a
beer
to
leave
be
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
my
six
pack
and
im
not
upset
that
i
purchased
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
though
it
seems
a
little
below
anchors
usual
standards
for
one
the
bitter
notes
seem
to
grow
with
subsequent
mouthfuls
leaving
the
tongue
tingling
and
the
tastebuds
reeling
with
sourtart
residue
still
the
flavors
are
crisp
and
nuanced
and
the
brew
just
screams
to
be
quaffed
at
a
hot
beach
o
one
of
the
most
flavorful
summer
beers
ive
had
overall
a
very
good
beer
definitely
a
summer
beer
o
for
what
it
is
its
not
that
bad
pretty
much
your
average
american
wheat
which
is
pretty
nice
and
refreshing
this
time
of
year
worth
a
try
if
you
like
this
style
anchor
should
know
that
a
little
more
character
wouldnt
do
their
summer
beer
any
harm
sure
as
is
it
makes
a
delightfully
refreshing
beer
that
lives
up
to
the
brewerys
established
standards
of
quality
and
is
tremendously
approachable
to
even
the
most
casual
of
beer
drinkers
but
its
a
little
too
nofrills
for
me
to
buy
it
consistently
if
again
at
all
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
huge
3
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
nice
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
and
some
citrus
zest
taste
is
of
sweet
malt
and
some
bitter
citrus
zest
hops
very
little
lingering
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
that
is
pretty
refreshing
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
anchor
overall
really
quite
bland
just
a
slight
step
up
above
a
generic
bmc
honestly
id
probably
just
go
with
my
standby
lager
o
overall
an
ok
beer
but
kind
of
bland
easy
to
drink
but
not
a
lot
going
on
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
compared
to
the
cheap
stuff
this
is
all
right
this
does
the
job
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
if
i
were
to
only
have
a
few
beers
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
choose
bells
oberon
something
with
more
complex
flavors
pours
from
the
22oz
bottle
a
rather
macrolike
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
settles
into
a
12
finger
collar
quite
high
carbonation
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
the
glass
theres
a
faint
aroma
of
light
citrus
1st
sip
brings
a
modest
taste
of
dry
grassylike
malt
some
bitter
lemon
peel
the
taste
is
a
little
too
understated
imho
its
not
bad
its
just
that
its
a
little
too
weak
faint
for
my
tastes
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
with
a
bit
of
sparkle
from
the
carbonation
this
is
pretty
refreshing
on
a
100
degree
plus
summer
day
like
today
i
just
wish
the
flavor
packed
a
bit
more
of
a
punch
solid
beer
onot
bad
id
not
really
seek
this
out
but
its
ok
in
a
very
large
field
of
serious
contenders
not
a
brilliant
effor
too
many
offnotes
there
was
a
brief
moment
in
the
first
minute
or
two
when
it
seemed
pleasant
and
lightly
hopped
but
it
went
downhill
from
there
perhaps
i
let
it
warm
up
too
much
at
any
rate
its
not
awful
but
somewhat
flawed
choose
something
better
this
brew
poured
up
a
cloudy
amber
colored
body
with
an
intense
foamy
white
head
with
amazing
retention
and
lacing
aromas
of
toastedbuttered
wheat
bread
lemon
zest
and
a
hint
of
some
field
grasses
light
to
mediumbodied
with
a
nice
lemonybready
flavor
almost
like
a
good
tea
cake
and
a
subtly
hoppy
bite
on
the
finish
with
is
smooth
and
crisp
and
definitely
not
heavy
or
harsh
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
sharp
with
some
firm
carbonation
and
a
light
body
the
co2
adds
a
nice
soda
like
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
is
the
icing
on
the
cake
maybe
i
am
biased
about
this
summer
beer
because
its
105
outside
right
now
but
this
seems
to
be
a
perfect
glass
of
suds
great
beer
looks
nice
and
smells
good
but
this
seemly
promising
beer
suffers
from
the
strong
lemony
bitterness
in
the
flavor
pours
a
clean
gold
with
moderate
cap
of
white
soapy
froth
scent
is
uber
pale
with
a
faint
kiss
of
malt
sweetness
lemon
and
bready
yeast
taste
brings
just
a
bit
more
to
the
experience
still
a
very
light
beer
with
only
touches
of
sweetness
bread
and
lemon
lighter
side
of
medium
slightly
watery
at
first
but
creamy
as
carbonation
escapes
and
the
beer
warms
not
quite
sure
what
the
goal
was
but
the
beer
was
too
mild
and
lacking
any
sort
of
style
d
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
you
can
drink
this
all
day
not
sure
if
i
would
necessarily
reach
for
this
one
first
but
would
not
turn
it
down
considering
how
much
i
like
anchor
steam
i
was
quite
let
down
with
this
beer
just
seemed
like
a
washed
out
summer
offering
a
good
choice
to
have
a
packed
cooler
with
a
selection
from
a
quality
brewer
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
i
feel
like
anchor
was
going
for
something
light
and
refreshing
for
summer
and
this
meets
the
criteria
id
consider
this
to
be
a
step
above
light
beer
which
in
this
case
isnt
a
bad
thing
id
recommend
giving
this
one
a
shot
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
in
a
glass
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
lemon
and
maybe
a
hint
of
banana
lemon
and
wheat
on
the
palate
with
a
crisp
finish
light
body
with
a
really
nice
tightly
wound
frothy
carbonation
a
solid
beer
from
anchor
o
as
good
as
some
anchor
beers
can
be
they
have
some
pretty
bad
ones
overall
solid
summer
offering
from
anchor
its
simple
and
understated
which
is
good
considering
the
purpose
of
this
beer
and
its
one
of
the
better
light
wheat
ales
ive
had
cheers
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
a
very
dry
finish
leaves
me
wanting
more
this
is
at
a
sessionable
abv
of
4
6
so
more
is
a
good
thing
medium
bodied
but
on
the
lighter
end
with
zesty
spice
earthy
floral
hops
and
sweet
malt
notes
again
im
not
pickig
up
much
wheat
beer
character
light
and
watery
with
some
grassy
hops
up
front
followed
by
some
peppery
spice
and
sweet
malt
notes
hits
of
caramel
toffee
and
biscuit
bland
but
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
like
their
porter
and
steam
beer
but
this
was
a
disappointment
overall
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
its
decent
just
nothing
overly
exciting
about
it
the
feel
is
nice
and
crisp
certainly
refreshing
for
a
cali
summer
behind
the
bite
is
a
silky
feel
thats
so
smooth
going
down
its
definitely
a
summer
beer
with
some
character
that
sets
it
apart
from
its
sometimes
boring
competitors
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
the
head
is
copious
at
first
but
quickly
dissipates
into
a
white
ring
atop
the
beer
the
beer
itself
is
yellow
with
orange
hues
not
much
smell
a
few
grainy
notes
detected
the
taste
itself
is
grainy
crisp
and
dry
with
a
subtle
citrus
presence
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
i
think
this
beer
certainly
achieves
anchors
goal
of
making
a
light
drinkable
summer
brew
which
is
why
i
gave
it
a
solid
overall
score
even
if
ill
probably
be
bored
with
it
by
the
time
i
finish
the
six
pack
i
enjoy
it
but
i
wont
be
rushing
to
have
it
again
especially
at
the
12six
pack
price
point
where
i
live
light
golden
in
color
slightly
hazy
with
no
head
retention
light
wheat
and
pilsner
malts
dominate
the
nose
the
hop
character
is
grassy
and
lightly
flowery
crisp
pale
malt
taste
with
the
same
hop
character
carrying
over
from
the
nose
floral
and
grassy
backed
by
some
of
the
pilsner
and
wheat
light
and
drinkable
but
nothing
to
fantastic
in
the
flavor
department
cheers
i
dont
know
what
is
going
on
with
anchor
but
im
surprised
they
dont
make
better
beers
given
their
historic
status
in
the
better
beer
movement
o
a
good
summer
brew
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
i
would
however
drinktry
it
again
overall
its
a
beer
i
would
like
to
try
more
than
one
of
great
summer
brew
o
i
have
a
bit
of
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
but
its
still
a
tasty
summer
id
drink
it
on
a
hot
day
and
enjoy
it
sort
of
a
weenie
wheat
beer
which
might
be
an
unfair
thing
to
say
about
a
beer
thats
only
50
wheat
but
still
its
a
weenie
wheat
beer
decent
copper
color
with
some
nice
sparkle
not
much
of
a
head
zipless
body
and
something
of
a
dry
corny
taste
that
the
malty
edge
just
couldnt
push
aside
dang
anchor
makes
such
terrific
porter
and
their
steam
beer
is
decent
what
happened
here
way
back
when
mid90s
i
drank
lots
of
anchor
products
now
i
rarely
pick
them
up
this
one
was
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
after
i
couldnt
find
a
sixth
beer
i
wanted
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
straw
and
light
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
bodied
and
drinkable
with
sweet
malt
and
just
the
barest
suggestion
of
hops
overall
nothing
worth
checking
out
o
enjoyable
summer
beer
its
easy
to
drink
light
and
crisp
should
compliment
all
the
summer
foods
this
season
has
to
offer
overall
this
is
really
one
of
those
summer
beers
that
could
be
drank
all
day
the
bitterness
is
refreshing
and
the
malted
wheat
provides
enough
of
an
earthy
sweetness
that
keeps
it
balanced
moderately
low
abv
would
allow
for
copious
amounts
to
be
consumed
with
little
to
no
worry
hadnt
had
this
for
a
while
and
forgot
how
good
it
was
bought
this
as
a
single
bottle
but
will
definitely
pick
up
more
of
this
a
beer
like
this
could
become
a
regular
for
me
during
a
long
hot
carolina
summer
recommended
overall
this
is
probably
the
best
american
hefeweizen
i
have
had
that
doesnt
make
it
the
best
american
wheat
ale
i
have
had
as
it
is
broad
style
that
includes
diverse
beers
such
as
lagunitas
little
sumpin
sumpin
bells
oberon
and
big
sky
trout
slayer
but
in
terms
of
the
old
fashioned
american
wheat
that
are
simply
hefeweizens
without
the
german
yeast
this
is
pretty
damn
good
most
are
overly
sweet
or
bland
but
this
is
dry
and
spicy
as
hell
glad
i
finally
tried
this
as
i
put
it
off
as
i
did
not
expect
much
i
love
anchor
but
this
is
pretty
bland
and
ho
hum
not
something
i
would
recommend
huge
frothy
head
rises
out
of
the
glass
pale
translucent
golden
aromas
are
tart
citrus
and
wheat
with
a
bit
of
something
baked
upon
first
sip
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
super
high
carbonation
and
overall
crispness
of
the
beer
flavors
are
mildly
buttery
malt
and
wheatgrass
thin
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
residuals
behind
and
this
is
no
exception
very
bright
flavor
profile
with
a
very
nice
touch
of
tartness
to
the
wheat
up
front
middle
is
moderately
soft
with
some
faint
wheat
grain
notes
at
the
finish
quite
nice
pours
golden
into
my
bear
republic
glass
a
good
sign
of
carbonation
when
the
little
bubbles
are
floating
to
the
top
a
very
subdue
smelling
and
tasting
beer
with
notes
of
faint
hops
rising
through
this
is
my
first
summer
themed
beer
and
im
sure
it
wont
be
my
last
with
summer
starting
for
me
wednesday
afternoon
this
would
be
a
good
pool
side
beer
o
very
drinkable
has
some
malt
and
hop
character
thats
nicely
balanced
citrus
and
carbonation
in
building
finish
is
very
refreshing
o
this
was
a
very
nice
drinking
summertime
beer
i
really
liked
the
way
the
beer
just
was
refreshing
alcohol
was
really
no
problem
at
all
which
could
be
a
bad
thing
a
nice
drinker
from
anchor
and
i
will
be
looking
for
this
one
during
these
warming
months
pours
clear
orange
in
body
with
white
bubbly
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
aroma
of
light
cereal
subtle
wheat
subtle
citrus
refreshing
flavor
of
light
cereal
grain
wheat
cornflakes
subtle
citrus
dry
and
clean
in
the
finish
light
body
with
light
carbonation
a
clean
palate
and
thirst
quenching
brew
pretty
flawless
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
particularly
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
a
good
summer
thirst
quencher
that
ill
like
to
have
around
during
these
hot
florida
days
i
dunno
i
just
dont
much
care
for
this
beer
not
what
i
want
from
a
apwa
overall
not
a
bad
interpretation
of
a
wheat
beer
for
an
american
wheat
beer
not
great
though
i
was
really
expecting
more
from
this
one
am
left
wanting
more
normally
anchor
hits
the
mark
on
their
beers
but
this
one
missed
for
me
i
would
love
to
smell
taste
more
of
that
banana
clove
that
is
so
very
custom
to
this
style
as
always
beer
is
good
prosit
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
not
much
to
write
home
about
but
it
is
pretty
good
the
pour
was
nicely
done
rich
golden
amber
in
color
with
a
huge
head
of
white
on
top
light
cloudiness
to
it
as
well
really
capped
it
off
quite
nicely
nice
lacing
down
the
sides
fits
the
style
perfectly
aroma
is
hoppy
lights
of
lemon
and
light
grassy
notes
abound
here
floral
would
be
the
optimal
word
though
it
did
tend
to
stray
off
the
path
a
touch
and
land
itself
in
the
lemon
category
a
bit
too
much
crisp
and
very
clean
on
the
palate
much
more
refreshing
and
light
then
i
thought
it
would
be
and
that
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
behold
rich
notes
of
lemon
and
light
grass
hints
of
wheat
on
the
tongue
and
a
nice
hit
of
peach
and
pear
on
the
finish
very
dry
finish
as
well
with
a
light
spicy
note
gracing
the
tongue
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
little
but
of
head
that
retains
a
little
the
aroma
is
malty
and
somewhat
floral
the
taste
also
has
floral
notes
and
a
good
amount
of
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
balanced
but
average
overall
a
crisp
summer
beer
taste
is
an
explosion
of
citrus
hops
balanced
with
a
strong
malty
presence
and
a
tinge
of
bitterness
refreshing
light
and
flavorful
drinkablity
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
beer
i
really
love
the
way
this
beer
way
walks
line
between
a
different
styles
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
certainly
would
make
a
very
nice
light
and
flavorful
summertime
beer
choice
o
overall
this
beer
is
what
i
expected
and
what
i
hoped
for
it
lives
up
to
what
is
says
it
is
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
as
summer
ales
go
this
ones
hit
all
the
key
components
a
wheaty
body
that
anchors
flavor
and
body
an
acidic
balance
of
tart
esters
and
sulfurs
and
a
grassy
hop
crispness
that
finish
the
beer
keep
it
low
in
gravity
for
an
effortless
beverage
to
drink
and
we
have
a
beer
thats
prime
for
the
season
we
have
anchor
summer
ale
so
bring
on
the
heat
o
i
am
biased
because
ipas
are
my
favorite
but
this
beer
was
not
even
enjoyable
for
me
craving
an
ipa
now
because
this
is
far
too
light
and
thin
o
this
is
a
new
summer
goto
crisp
refreshing
light
but
still
tasty
its
what
bmc
should
be
some
folks
knock
this
style
but
its
legit
to
me
and
serves
its
purpose
this
offering
from
anchor
hits
the
mark
perfectly
based
on
its
description
on
this
label
ill
have
another
please
o
a
solid
offering
as
anchor
offerings
almost
always
are
wasnt
overly
thrilled
by
this
brew
from
anchor
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
straw
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
on
it
the
aromas
of
fresh
grains
were
bursting
out
of
this
one
the
hops
werent
there
or
hidden
by
something
else
i
suppose
the
flavor
was
very
light
on
this
brew
i
really
thought
anchor
would
have
done
something
to
kick
this
up
a
notch
i
felt
that
the
mouthfeel
was
good
for
a
summer
brew
but
the
flavors
just
werent
overly
exciting
smooth
mouthfeel
this
is
different
from
other
pale
wheat
ales
but
in
a
good
way
very
drinkable
d
not
something
i
would
normally
pick
up
but
as
one
of
six
mystery
beers
i
got
this
first
one
tastes
pretty
darn
good
great
beer
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
by
this
one
it
was
reminiscent
of
a
weizen
o
a
pilsner
anyway
not
a
bad
brew
head
is
similar
to
a
light
lager
smell
is
yeasty
and
malty
taste
is
light
but
pretty
toasty
with
a
bit
of
hops
right
before
an
easy
finish
low
alcohol
appropriate
to
its
name
drinkability
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
anchors
version
has
been
around
for
a
long
time
and
this
is
not
too
bad
dthis
is
tough
not
close
to
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
wheat
beer
interesting
and
unique
but
in
some
weird
ways
this
is
summer
wheat
ale
done
right
high
regards
for
this
seasonal
and
it
is
a
session
beer
to
boot
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
while
vacationing
at
the
beach
last
week
im
not
a
big
summer
beer
fan
but
it
was
summer
and
i
was
on
the
beach
so
what
the
hell
it
was
ok
not
great
cloudy
and
light
in
color
with
a
wheaty
aroma
flavor
was
light
but
pretty
good
i
certainly
didnt
spill
any
out
but
i
wont
be
ordering
or
buying
it
anytime
again
soon
if
youre
looking
for
a
summer
session
beer
then
look
no
further
i
couldnt
feel
the
alcohol
in
this
and
i
imagine
that
it
would
be
easy
to
down
more
than
one
if
i
wished
to
if
for
nothing
else
enjoy
this
for
a
copious
head
and
subtle
easygoing
nature
of
this
beer
there
isnt
another
summer
offering
quite
like
this
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
faded
slowly
with
nice
ring
lacing
the
aroma
is
moderately
grainy
with
a
lot
of
the
wheat
malt
showing
up
but
overall
not
a
lot
on
the
nose
the
front
end
is
very
thin
with
hardly
anything
going
on
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
middle
and
then
a
very
fast
finish
thats
slightly
drying
body
is
very
thin
drinkability
is
ok
but
theres
not
very
much
to
this
beer
quite
disappointing
coming
from
anchor
i
love
a
nice
clean
refreshing
summer
beer
but
that
doesnt
it
should
taste
like
tonic
water
feel
as
you
would
expect
is
crisp
and
refreshing
has
good
crackle
but
the
carbonation
isnt
overbearing
good
thirst
quencherlawnmower
beer
i
could
drink
a
few
at
a
tailgate
or
bbq
d
an
extremely
refreshing
summer
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
your
standard
american
wheat
beer
anchor
summer
has
a
faded
john
deere
yellow
color
and
a
one
finger
white
head
it
looks
just
like
what
i
expect
a
summer
beer
should
look
like
it
has
a
heavier
nose
than
i
would
have
expected
the
slightest
hint
of
lemon
tickles
my
nose
the
citrus
comes
out
in
the
first
sip
leaving
some
coriander
on
the
tongue
there
is
some
grainy
wheat
on
the
finish
that
lingers
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
umph
on
the
flavor
this
is
still
one
of
the
better
summer
beer
out
there
to
be
honest
id
probably
go
for
an
anchor
steam
or
a
liberty
ale
if
i
had
the
choice
they
share
many
of
the
same
attributes
but
with
a
bolder
flavor
but
this
is
still
a
pretty
nice
beer
if
youre
looking
for
something
a
bit
lighter
too
dry
to
be
refreshing
lack
of
pleasant
flavor
and
composed
of
almost
entirely
bitterness
if
you
can
imagine
that
as
a
taste
the
phenols
are
way
too
harsh
maybe
a
bad
bottle
but
the
bottle
i
had
was
not
good
new
to
bc
this
is
a
very
typical
american
wheat
that
doesnt
pretend
to
be
a
hefe
or
a
wit
clean
crisp
and
well
made
this
beer
is
much
like
a
lager
in
taste
and
nose
i
added
a
slice
of
lime
and
really
like
that
a
summer
patio
beer
not
a
breakthrough
beer
like
most
of
the
other
anchor
offerings
but
a
simple
thirst
quencher
with
no
pretensions
otherwise
d
low
abv
is
good
but
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
not
full
of
citrus
and
crisp
this
one
has
a
little
more
too
it
that
most
summer
beers
give
this
one
a
try
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
pale
wheats
have
their
place
but
this
just
misses
the
mark
there
are
at
least
half
a
dozen
easily
available
versions
that
are
markedly
more
enjoyable
d
its
a
refreshing
ale
for
sure
drinks
like
a
lager
a
bit
i
guess
no
problem
putting
a
couple
of
these
down
in
the
summer
heat
d
its
drinkable
for
the
summer
but
for
me
it
would
lose
every
time
to
a
good
german
hefe
would
be
good
in
a
session
i
could
pound
a
few
of
these
pours
a
deep
golden
with
a
nice
big
layer
of
foam
it
dissipates
slowly
leaving
a
moderate
amount
of
lacing
a
restrained
aroma
with
tangy
citrusy
notes
up
front
but
less
of
a
malt
presence
than
i
had
hoped
for
tart
citrusy
notes
up
front
again
in
the
taste
but
not
much
maltiness
to
be
found
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
there
is
a
nice
lively
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
decent
choice
for
nice
hot
summer
days
but
i
think
there
are
better
brews
of
this
style
to
be
found
out
there
pours
a
clear
gold
color
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
grain
slight
metallic
hint
of
hop
hint
of
citrus
and
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
grain
metallic
hint
of
hops
hint
of
citrus
and
pale
malt
overall
not
that
great
odd
metallic
notes
are
offputting
and
there
is
a
strong
grain
presence
that
is
not
helpful
at
all
the
taste
was
also
mostly
benign
but
had
a
bit
of
grainyness
and
a
slightly
funky
yeast
finish
the
body
was
typical
for
the
style
drinkability
was
ok
but
with
the
beer
being
so
bland
why
would
you
bother
a
drinkable
if
not
good
beer
it
would
certainly
be
refreshing
in
the
right
circumstance
but
would
be
a
bit
underwhelming
under
any
others
a
summer
ale
that
is
all
about
the
undulating
fields
of
wheat
and
much
less
about
what
the
hops
can
do
for
you
as
they
are
pretty
lowkey
in
this
offering
unfortunately
what
the
malt
has
to
say
just
isnt
all
that
interesting
being
that
it
has
a
leaky
diacetyl
valve
or
something
not
a
drinking
experience
that
i
care
to
repeat
on
this
or
any
other
patio
i
might
stumble
into
across
i
mean
across
dsurprisingly
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
had
me
two
this
is
pretty
easy
drinking
in
fact
very
easy
nice
low
abv
and
light
refreshing
taste
make
this
perfect
for
summer
the
usual
suspects
wheat
lemon
citrus
haze
and
little
wallop
of
bitterness
maybe
some
coriander
in
there
as
well
a
decent
summer
offering
nothing
to
write
home
about
anchor
stuff
always
seems
a
little
pricey
a
pretty
standard
wheat
well
made
just
nothing
out
of
this
world
id
drink
again
but
wouldnt
lay
down
many
bones
for
one
of
these
anchor
summer
beer
on
tap
pours
a
light
gold
in
color
with
a
decent
head
and
lace
aroma
is
light
just
some
zested
citrus
and
pale
malts
flavor
is
quite
satisfying
and
refreshing
wheat
and
lemon
playing
key
roles
in
the
flavor
theater
i
was
along
for
the
ride
and
it
was
certainly
worth
it
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
drinkability
rates
very
high
a
summer
beer
with
some
character
and
flavor
another
great
one
from
anchor
mouthfeel
is
smooth
buttery
which
is
a
bit
unusual
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
something
id
seek
out
again
drinkability
quite
easy
to
quaff
this
down
doesnt
overload
the
senses
and
is
a
good
summer
beer
i
honestly
prefer
sas
summer
to
this
and
in
the
future
will
pick
that
up
over
this
but
good
to
try
drinkability
smooth
crisp
light
the
lingering
taste
is
not
awesome
but
its
fine
d
they
nailed
it
with
the
summer
ale
as
it
is
the
perfect
drink
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
very
sessionable
and
perfect
for
sharing
amongst
friends
nonoffensive
and
would
be
enjoyed
by
any
beer
drinker
definitely
not
exclusive
to
craft
beer
drinkers
notes
i
had
this
paired
with
several
excellent
authentic
italian
salume
products
and
the
citrus
and
carbonation
did
an
excellent
job
of
palate
cleansing
and
held
up
well
this
may
be
the
first
beer
i
can
assuredly
classify
as
a
lawnmower
brew
i
just
might
seek
this
out
when
i
know
ill
be
in
the
sun
for
more
than
15
minutes
d
i
probably
would
not
consider
this
a
mainstay
summer
beer
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
beer
very
crisp
and
carbonated
sour
citrus
aftertaste
cold
light
very
consumable
summer
beer
its
summer
and
frankly
something
too
complex
wouldnt
satisfy
me
when
the
ol
sweats
a
rolling
would
i
drink
another
one
why
im
going
to
get
it
right
now
very
drinkable
nice
summer
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
thick
head
that
did
not
disappear
aroma
i
just
couldnt
smell
anything
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
reminded
me
of
sour
fruit
candywith
a
bit
of
a
malty
finish
this
beer
is
a
really
weak
version
of
this
style
d
would
i
have
this
again
probably
not
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
what
i
expected
and
what
reality
actually
is
this
one
is
not
even
close
i
see
this
was
categorized
as
a
pale
wheat
beer
but
it
seemed
more
like
an
attempt
at
a
kolsch
whatever
not
a
very
good
beer
d
this
beer
was
a
disappointment
sure
they
go
down
like
water
but
this
beer
is
really
lackluster
and
ordinary
there
are
definitely
better
wheats
available
and
this
is
certainly
not
on
par
with
anchors
other
offerings
drinkability
it
has
no
outstanding
qualities
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
cheaper
pilsner
drinkable
but
nothing
that
want
make
me
buy
it
again
md
slightly
thin
body
and
somewhat
overcarbonated
but
in
the
extremelyfillinganddifficulttogetthroughonebottle
respect
not
the
sharpbitingcarbonationthatmakesyouwanttobelch
respect
somewhat
of
a
lackluster
beer
overall
d
one
of
my
favorite
summer
sessionalbe
beer
a
clean
and
easy
to
drink
beer
with
good
flavor
and
no
bitterness
great
on
a
hot
day
or
with
a
meal
dm
clean
not
too
carbonated
and
very
refreshing
a
very
solid
summer
brew
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
san
francisco
poured
into
a
small
6
ounce
fluted
glass
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
wispy
and
fresh
pretty
drinkable
and
quite
delicious
nice
wheat
flavor
with
moderate
bitterness
from
the
hops
great
sessionable
summer
wheat
i
havent
tried
many
summer
seasonals
that
really
stand
out
for
me
but
this
one
does
and
i
make
sure
to
get
my
fill
every
summer
d
this
could
easily
be
this
summers
session
beer
for
me
so
easy
to
drink
light
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
what
else
could
i
ask
for
notes
i
would
go
back
for
this
one
summer
time
beers
are
my
least
favorite
seasonal
style
and
this
one
is
bending
my
expectations
o
very
refreshing
and
full
of
flavor
i
would
find
this
beer
a
great
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
pours
out
a
hazy
gold
brew
with
a
prety
big
head
super
carbonated
has
a
grainy
macro
brew
smell
to
it
tastehmm
very
good
now
mind
you
im
rating
this
for
the
style
taste
is
very
mild
well
balanced
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
or
maltbutits
incredibly
smooth
beats
the
crap
outta
any
macro
out
there
mouthfeel
is
avg
drinkability
super
high
on
list
an
awesome
summer
brew
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
lightly
flavored
and
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
quite
good
a
summer
beer
for
a
yard
party
i
could
see
having
another
and
i
certainly
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
that
being
said
i
dont
think
ill
be
making
any
strong
efforts
to
seek
out
more
of
this
beer
bjcp
score
33
drinkability
isnt
bad
at
all
quite
content
with
this
one
edit
i
return
to
this
because
it
seemed
there
was
a
little
bit
more
to
it
talk
about
a
finish
i
think
as
it
warmed
it
was
a
bit
better
not
that
i
want
this
warm
on
a
summer
day
but
i
did
drink
this
on
a
cool
spring
evening
i
just
compared
it
to
the
sierra
nevada
summerfest
and
i
think
i
would
prefer
this
one
if
i
had
a
choice
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
during
or
after
some
yard
work
verdict
up
to
this
point
in
my
journey
the
anchor
beers
ive
tried
have
always
been
incredibly
solid
and
have
held
up
remarkably
given
their
age
unfortunately
anchor
summer
beer
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
rest
of
the
line
for
me
in
the
flavor
department
i
can
see
this
being
the
right
beer
for
the
market
back
when
it
was
introduced
but
today
it
just
comes
off
as
too
thin
and
bland
maybe
its
time
for
something
new
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
refreshing
but
is
also
light
in
the
flavor
department
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
there
are
better
representations
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
overall
just
not
the
best
of
the
american
pale
wheat
ale
d
a
really
quality
drinkable
summer
beer
light
in
body
but
enough
to
to
provide
nice
flavor
profile
bitterness
finishes
nicely
very
refreshing
will
plan
to
have
this
around
for
warm
grilling
days
at
the
lake
really
nice
as
a
summer
session
beer
at
4
60
abv
no
reason
not
to
try
this
beer
something
for
the
patio
when
its
a
little
to
hot
the
only
thing
that
kind
of
takes
away
a
bit
for
me
is
the
heavy
carbonation
a
bit
too
intense
for
me
drinkability
is
fine
it
has
a
light
enough
taste
that
i
could
probably
drink
large
quantities
of
it
but
the
taste
is
light
enough
that
i
wouldnt
be
drawn
to
that
scenario
cheers
pale
golden
with
a
thick
finger
of
offwhite
foam
that
sticks
to
the
glass
a
little
the
nose
is
pretty
weak
wheat
malt
and
mild
citrus
peel
are
present
however
faint
untoasted
grain
and
lemon
zest
are
balanced
with
mild
hop
bittering
tastes
good
but
could
use
a
stronger
concentration
to
suit
my
tastes
medium
light
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
this
brew
finishes
squeaky
clean
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
there
are
many
better
choices
in
this
category
bottle
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
lot
of
head
that
dissolves
almost
immediately
the
smell
is
not
very
strong
or
clear
i
almost
feel
like
i
smell
leeks
or
some
sort
of
vegetable
the
taste
is
also
really
bland
a
little
bit
of
bitter
but
not
else
with
maybe
a
little
donspecific
citrusy
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sharp
to
the
tongue
and
not
smooth
at
all
but
has
a
thinner
texture
beer
overall
is
not
easy
to
drink
d
id
grab
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
but
not
if
given
a
wider
selection
das
for
drinkiability
it
was
fine
for
a
lawnmower
style
of
beer
not
quite
the
bold
flavor
of
summer
i
was
hoping
for
i
dont
think
this
is
a
goto
beer
pours
golden
with
a
huge
frothy
lattelike
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
smells
of
delicate
grain
and
lenon
and
orange
citrus
a
slight
malty
sweetness
and
finishes
clean
the
taste
soft
and
saltysweet
with
lots
of
graininess
and
a
soft
malty
background
tastes
a
little
tired
smooth
in
the
mouth
but
a
bit
too
soft
this
could
definitely
use
some
crispness
just
okay
i
like
my
summer
beers
either
a
bit
more
tart
or
crisp
or
both
bright
yellow
with
a
huge
pure
white
head
in
the
glass
however
this
beer
appears
to
have
been
filtered
as
it
is
way
too
clear
for
a
wheat
ale
the
nose
is
a
bit
grainy
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
some
grassy
hoppiness
a
bit
too
clean
and
reminiscent
of
a
lager
for
my
liking
the
taste
too
is
very
crisp
clean
and
pretty
much
just
like
a
lager
the
bitterness
is
ok
and
carbonation
is
fairly
high
however
the
malt
is
too
thin
and
therefore
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
are
way
too
thin
and
dry
i
was
definitely
anticipating
quite
a
bit
more
ok
i
do
have
to
admit
that
it
is
drinkable
but
fairly
plain
and
on
the
low
end
of
the
summer
beer
ranking
that
stated
id
still
reach
for
this
before
a
macro
lager
because
it
does
manage
satisfy
my
thirst
on
a
hot
day
not
my
favorite
though
pretty
well
rounded
beer
i
think
this
would
be
great
as
a
session
beer
during
any
summer
get
together
overall
a
pretty
decent
simple
american
wheat
ale
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
a
couple
more
bottles
on
hand
drinkability
not
offensive
smooth
and
enjoyable
but
sacrifices
flavor
and
nose
for
that
experience
for
the
price
there
are
cheaper
beers
with
similar
flavor
and
at
any
price
there
are
beers
that
pull
off
the
american
pale
wheat
ale
much
more
enjoyably
carbonation
is
high
but
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
just
an
average
beer
not
much
of
interest
in
this
one
really
although
its
not
bad
in
the
least
kind
of
in
keeping
with
most
of
anchors
offerings
pours
your
standard
apwa
yellow
with
a
smallish
white
head
nose
and
flavors
are
surprisingly
dirty
kind
of
a
graininess
that
gives
it
a
bit
of
character
otherwise
your
standard
mild
wheat
and
a
touch
of
citrus
body
is
fine
appropriate
with
busy
carbonation
overall
not
bad
at
all
for
the
summer
a
standard
american
wheat
easy
drinking
summer
beer
but
not
enough
character
to
be
highly
sessionable
not
my
favorite
style
by
a
long
shot
mfd
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
session
beer
what
you
expect
from
anchor
d
i
dont
mind
the
fruitless
style
this
guy
puts
forth
however
i
will
probably
never
get
this
again
sometimes
the
summer
beers
are
too
predictable
with
their
lemons
and
oranges
this
was
a
change
good
or
bad
i
will
let
you
decide
d
a
very
good
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
not
a
very
high
abv
certainly
a
summer
andor
session
beer
not
the
strongest
tasting
anchor
brew
but
a
decent
offering
md
clean
and
extralight
excellent
drinking
for
a
refresher
or
session
beer
a
pretty
bland
beer
especially
for
the
style
maybe
it
was
the
filtering
not
sure
d
even
after
a
long
walk
on
a
summer
evening
this
beer
does
little
for
me
drink
6
of
the
12
oz
for
the
review
overall
an
interesting
light
beer
i
wont
have
a
problem
finishing
off
all
6
d
eyecatching
check
refreshing
and
light
check
alas
this
is
a
pretty
boring
wheat
ale
from
anchor
its
not
bad
but
there
is
little
to
recommend
it
over
some
of
its
competitors
this
beer
is
made
for
summer
sailing
very
uplifing
to
say
the
least
and
it

oat
or
hay
type
of
taste
and
texture
curiously
the
carbonation
makes
it
a
bit
more
rough
in
feel
than
smoothed
out
any
citrus
element
a
bit
player
here
if
it
gets
warm
enough
theres
some
maltiness
near
the
finish
to
lessen
the
bitterness
would
drink
one
if
someone
handed
it
to
me
thats
about
it
d
its
drinkable
just
wish
the
taste
matched
the
killer
appearance
id
drink
again
but
wouldnt
buy
it
guess
its
just
ok
for
me
nothing
really
stood
out
aside
from
the
appearance
nothing
to
sneeze
at
but
i
dont
think
this
will
make
anyone
any
more
sit
up
and
take
notice
but
a
classic
and
a
perfect
seasonal
a
crisp
light
and
refreshingf
beer
id
gladly
have
one
if
i
was
offered
it
on
a
hot
day
but
its
nothing
that
blows
the
mind
d
a
fine
summer
beer
light
and
crisp
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
in
terms
of
its
flavor
anchor
summer
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
beer
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
fruity
wooden
aroma
saaz
and
it
smells
a
little
funky
its
light
bodied
smooth
and
foamy
with
a
crisp
finish
its
a
mellow
flavor
theres
enough
green
bitterness
to
keep
me
thirsty
theres
a
note
of
lemon
rind
at
the
finish
its
a
nice
summer
beer
not
watered
down
but
simple
and
refreshing
not
bad
but
not
good
either
this
beer
pours
a
bright
yellowgold
color
with
a
puffy
white
head
it
smells
a
lot
like
a
mediocre
lager
sorta
grain
sour
it
tastes
a
bit
better
with
some
citric
notes
and
a
cleaner
malt
flavor
im
still
a
bit
surprised
that
this
is
an
ale
id
love
if
brewers
took
beers
like
this
and
made
a
lager
version
of
the
same
recipe
it
seems
like
an
interesting
comparison
with
such
a
light
and
fairly
crisp
beer
at
any
rate
its
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
and
preferable
to
most
bmc
lagers
but
its
not
a
huge
step
up
then
again
its
a
fairly
weak
style
so
my
score
is
probably
a
bit
harsh
pours
luminous
transparent
golden
color
with
enormous
white
head
nose
is
nothing
like
a
wheat
beer
instead
it
has
a
rather
lagerlike
metallic
hop
aroma
with
faint
grain
in
the
background
on
the
palate
the
hop
tang
comes
through
almost
like
this
is
a
watery
version
of
a
bohemian
pils
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
with
not
much
positive
to
say
overall
a
fine
warm
weather
beer
easily
sessionable
a
good
summer
beer
very
similar
to
sierra
nevadas
summer
perfect
for
a
hot
day
nice
and
crisp
and
grassy
was
a
big
fan
of
all
the
other
anchor
stuff
ive
had
in
the
past
so
getting
their
summer
seasonal
was
a
no
brainer
i
must
say
im
a
tad
disappointed
with
this
one
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
not
much
action
going
on
inside
the
beer
starts
off
with
a
big
fluffy
head
but
quickly
dissipates
typical
light
bodied
wheat
summery
taste
that
seems
to
be
cloned
across
the
summer
seasonal
board
the
taste
not
so
appealing
on
this
one
though
finishes
a
tad
try
drinkable
none
the
less
but
i
had
this
following
a
southern
tier
hop
sun
and
that
is
a
good
amount
better
than
this
one
ill
try
other
summer
seasonals
but
thanks
for
trying
anchor
d
a
fine
go
to
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
not
memorable
an
easy
going
beer
for
sure
it
claims
on
the
label
to
be
the
first
american
wheat
beer
of
the
modern
erafirst
brewed
in
1984
anchor
deserves
kudos
for
that
and
it
was
likely
quite
the
brew
back
then
in
the
current
modern
milieu
though
this
beer
is
nothing
more
then
average
light
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
on
those
hot
summer
days
prolly
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
definately
nice
while
playing
some
disc
golf
dont
get
me
wrong
i
could
drink
a
12
pack
on
a
hot
day
and
not
even
blink
one
of
the
better
lawn
cutting
brews
drinkability
extremely
smooth
a
great
warm
weather
beer
d
not
bad
but
not
particularly
good
either
this
would
be
good
if
you
need
something
to
quench
a
monster
thirst
without
any
big
flavors
getting
in
the
way
d
great
beer
to
drink
sitting
on
the
end
of
the
dock
i
was
sort
of
hoping
this
would
be
a
boring
but
highly
drinkable
summer
wheat
unfortunately
it
isnt
i
sort
of
winced
on
my
first
taste
but
then
warmed
up
slightly
to
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
medium
on
the
light
side
but
it
lacks
the
drinkability
that
it
ought
to
have
as
a
lessthandelicious
summer
brew
lighter
bodied
and
carbonated
gets
a
few
points
in
this
area
for
assisting
in
drinkability
a
hot
weather
beer
for
sure
but
not
enough
complexity
to
make
me
seek
this
instead
of
something
else
not
a
stinker
in
any
respect
and
well
structured
for
what
it
is
but
uh
it
is
what
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
that
good
for
anchor
still
worth
a
grab
for
a
sixer
if
you
are
going
to
the
beach
with
some
friends
or
whatever
a
decent
wheat
ale
similar
to
most
wheat
ales
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
so
many
other
summer
wheat
beers
that
are
a
notch
better
than
this
one

i
think
the
filtering
gets
rid
of
most
of
what
works
well
with
the

the

drinkability
well
that
was
a
big
cold

of
absolutely
nothing

washed

woefully

yes
i
understand
summer
beers
often
opt
for
lighter

profiles

this
is
ridiculous
d
quite
good
i
will
keep
these
on

for
warm

perhaps
not

one

out

simply

lemony

lets
the
wheat
malt
speak
for
itself
as
the
label
would
suggest
good
summer
time
beer
medium
carbonation
but
a
little
watery
i
wouldnt
argue
if
someone
offered
me
one
but
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonals
overall
d
an
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
reminds
me
of
anchor
steam
with
wheat
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
with
its
light
feel
and
taste
it
makes
for
a
good
warm
weather
beer
perfect
for
a
bbq
highly
drinkable
but
lack
of
flavors
discourages
me
from
wanting
to
try
more
than
one
of
these
beer
looks
amazing
but
tastes
extremely
mediocre
not
rushing
to
try

of

d
this
wheat
beer
is
a
good
drink
very
sessionable
and
another
good
beer
by
anchor
much
lighter
than
my
expectation
notes
from
122204
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
a
sour
wheat
element
the
appearance
is
golden
with
a
foamy
head
the
flavor
has
the
wheat
malt
bitterness
and
some
of
the
sourness
from
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
i
think
this
beer
would
benefit
if
it
were
unfiltered
its
not
bad
but
not
that
good
either
d
eminently
drinkable
even
when
consumed
a
bit
out
of
season
would
be
a
good
picnic
or
baseball
game
beer
served
cold
i
enjoyed
the
draft
version
much
more
than
the
bottled
one
pours
a
very
translucent
noncloudy
yellow
colored
body
with
a
big
white
head
thats
somewhat
lasting
has
a
very
malty
aroma
slightly
acidic
nose
some
effervescence
a
smooth
malty
taste
but
not
skunky
and
not
nutty
very
refreshing
d
overall
the
flavor
was
muted
a
tad
watery
and
disappointing
making
this
a
quaffer
or
lawnmower
beer
at
best
overall
not
worth
it
to
me
the
price
is
a
little
much
for
what
im
getting
here
ive
had
better
of
this
style
the
aroma
was
citrusy
and
of
malted
wheat
faint
pear
smell
the
taste
was
bitter
wheat
with
a
crisp
finish
it
was
highly
carbonated
and
full
of
pop
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
story
to
tell
not
my
f
the
taste
is
too
thin
bland
and
rough
with
a
rough
bitternes
that
is
far
too
strong
for
this
beer
and
its
thin
character
it
is
mostly
light
lemon
and
crackers
its
worse
with
food
definitely
not
a
bad
choice
for
the
end
of
an
afternoon
mowing
the
lawn
not
a
bad
choice
if
you
want
something
different
from
a
standard
issue
lager
or
pilsner
in
the
summertime
outside
of
its
appropriate
context
id
steer
away
but
feel
free
to
enjoy
in

of
a
summer

nothing

to
me
this
seems
like
a
czech
pils
made
with
a
good
deal
of
wheat
also
this
is
very
clean
tasting
with
no
apparent
flaws
which
would
be
easily
detected
given
the
lightness
of
the
beer
not
an
all
year
round
beer
for
me
but
i
will
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
for
the
next
heatwave
we
are
supposed
to
get
pours
a
nice
dark

color
with
excellent

and

for
a
wheat
beer
good
scent
slightly
malty
and
wheaty
but
fairly
weak
good
taste
although
the
pepperspice
flavors
almost
completely
overtake
the
wheat
beer
flavor
lurking
in
the
background
its
a
little
rough
going
down
but
not
bad
not
the
best
summer
beer
nor
the
best
wheat
beer
but
worth
a
try
if
thats
your
style
of
interest
overall
anchor
summer
beer
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
to
enjoy
in
the
warmer
summer
months
worth
a
shot
notes
what
a
disappointment
i
found
this
easy
to
drink
in
the
sense
that
it
was
not
a
horrible
beeryet
in
this
style
i
expect
a
whole
lot
more
i
remember
enjoying
my
thin
widmer
more
and
that
is
not
even
in
top
class
do
you
think
i
will
buy
this
again
overall
a
solid
summer
brew
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
really
nice
summer
brew
overall
this
a
refreshing
brew
a
good
quaffer
for
these
blistering
summer
days
the
beer
is
fairly
light
all
the
way
around
its
a
good
brew
but
there
are
other
summer
brews
i
would
reach
for
a
mild
herbal
wheat
flavor
comes
though
along
with
caramel
malts
and
a
subdued
hop
presence
this
beer
is
perfectly
unoffensive
but
lacks
any
standout
qualities
nice
for
a
summer
day
where
you
dont
want
to
have
to
think
about
what
youre
drinking
drinkability
ive
had
better
summer
beers
but
this
isnt
a
bad
attempt
just
average
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
the
anchor
crew
well
carbonated
and
compared
to
the
flavor
not
terribly
thin
mouthfeel
that
is
unfortunately
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
i
have
to
admit
im
pretty
disappointed
after
everything
else
ive
had
from
anchor
still
drinkable
but
nothing
ill
pick
up
again
a
must
try
for
the
summer
beer
fan
out
there
even
with
the
high
price
tag
i
believe
i
will
be
buying
another
one
of
these
as
fall
is
still
23
months
away
d
not
the
best
anchor
has
but
solid
id
prefer
the
liberty
ale
for
a
refreshing
beer
drinkability
is
a
bit
above
average
poured
in
to
a
tulip
glass
i
like
it
very
cold
awesome
white
foamy
head
like
whipped
cream
leaves
some
nice
rings
nose
very
flat
feels
good
in
mouth
im
starting
to
like
wheat
beers
clean
aftertaste
lives
up
to
its
name
very
drinkable
summer
beer
would
like
to
put
a
case
of
this
on
ice
and
drink
a
few
and
take
a
nap
d
better
then
bud
or
miller
but
not
that
impressed
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
so
many
other
wheat
beers
out
there
that
i
prefer
although
it
would
be
a
step
up
from
a
lite
beer
when
drinking
all
day
or
out
in
the
sun
d
definitely
drinkable
the
name
says
it
all
in
that
this
is
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
my
favorite
anchor
but
for
what
it
is
i
did
enjoy
this
brew
the
summer
beer
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
as
a
light
refreshing
lawnmower
brew
if
not
much
else
i
personally
prefer
a
hoppier
beer
to
beat
the
heat
and
would
reach
for
their
liberty
ale
before
this
seasonal
but
the
summer
beer
is
pretty
good
for
what
its
intended
for
for
us
all
its
the
rich
mans
coors
smooth
and
not
complex
in
the
slightest
this
wont
offend
much
by
anything
obnoxious
but
rather
by
what
this
wasnt
the
color
is
clear
for
a
pale
wheat
but
more
importantly
this
lacks
any
reminder
of
pale
wheat
ale
flavor
its
more
reminiscent
of
a
fairly
good
macro
ale
honestly
not
a
bad
way
to
beat
the
heat
but
not
one
that
piques
my
interest
the
drink
is
on
the
thin
side
of
mediumthin
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
and
is
consequentially
pretty
darned
easy
to
drink
md
fizzy
light
bodied
crisp
not
too
much
of
a
surprise
decent
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
enough
but
it
could
really
use
some
taste
d
the
crisp
and
mild
taste
w
nice
creaminess
from
carbonation
makes
this
a
great
summer
beer
or
lawnmower
beer
if
you
will
the
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
but
doesnt
scrimp
on
flavor
in
the
least
i
could
see
this
becoming
more
frequent
beverage
in
my
summer
lineup
this
has
plenty
of
quaffadrinkability
nice
body
to
it
without
being
too
heavy
a
very
drinkable
beer
probably
one
of
my
new
summer
favorites
mouthfeel
and
drinkabliity
light
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
and
carbonation
is
lower
than
expected
perhaps
this
gives
the
perception
of
a
heavier
bodymedium
as
opposed
to
light
this
is
one
id
drink
again
but
im
definitely
not
going
to
pay
9
99
a
sixer
for
it
again
show
me
a
bar
where
this
beer
is
reasonably
priced
and
ill
buy
it
again
glad
i
tried
it
but
just
not
worth
the
money
a
drinkable
summer
beer
but
nothing
special
aggressive
pour
gave
about
a
finger
and
a
half
fluffy
head
which
dissipated
after
a
minute
or
two
into
nothing
and
no
lacing
color
of
apple
juice
smell
was
bready
and
extremely
subtle
fruit
notes
with
a
metallic
twang
in
there
somewhere
first
taste
yep
tastes
like
an
anchor
beer
very
bready
and
lagerlike
its
hard
to
believe
they
use
ale
yeast
im
not
a
big
fan
of
anchor
and
this
beer
did
little
to
increase
their
stock
with
me
however
it
does
go
down
pretty
nicely
with
a
satisfyingly
bitter
finish
its
not
horrible
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
notes
im
generally
a
big
fan
of
anchor
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
ill
stick
to
liberty
ale
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
dark
goldenstraw
color
with
a
prolific
amount
of
persistent
bubbly
carbonation
that
results
in
an
offwhite
3finger
head
that
recedes
at
a
slow
pace
and
leaves
no
lacing
behind
swish
it
around
a
bit
to
open
up
the
aromas
smells
malty
and
buttery
with
some
banana
and
orange
fruitiness
in
the
background
tastes
malty
up
front
with
some
very
slight
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
round
things
out
mouthfeel
is
light
to
mediumbodied
and
very
drinkable
anchor
is
very
proud
of
this
brew
and
it
does
have
the
history
to
make
them
feel
proud
of
it
but
it
does
not
compare
to
some
of
their
other
standards
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
pretty
serious
white
head
and
excellent
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
a
little
plain
wheaty
maybe
a
touch
of
lemon
taste
is
bready
with
a
strange
bit
of
sourness
in
the
mix
its
crisp
drying
kind
of
refreshing
certainly
drinkable
but
a
little
uninspiring
considering
how
tasty
the
rest
of
the
anchor
lineup
is
worth
a
try
in
the
summer
though
drinkability
none
of
us
really
enjoy
the
taste
of
this
one
so
even
though
its
pretty
smooth
i
cant
imagine
any
of
us
drinking
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
unless
its
one
of
the
few
beers
at
a
party
nothing
special
here
were
pretty
dissapointed
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
nice
1
finger
creamy
white
head
head
was
made
up
mostly
of
very
very
small
bubbles
looked
like
whipped
cream
on
top
and
left
great
lacings
on
the
sides
smell
reminded
me
of
white
bread
and
for
lack
of
better
terms
summer
in
the
farm
country
taste
at
times
was
bland
almost
macroish
had
hints
of
table
pepper
and
vanilla
but
very
minor
felt
like
a
summer
beer
going
down
didnt
coat
well
but
was
a
decent
consistency
definitely
a
good
summer
beer
for
a
hot
sunny
day
of
lawn
mowing
but
i
cant
see
doing
much
more
than
that
overall
a
fine
selection
and
something
that
will
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
during
summertime
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
which
is
a
total
bummer
as
i
could
have
bought
a
six
pack
of
bud
for
less
than
half
the
price
and
would
have
had
a
very
similar
experience
pours
a
slightly
hazed
amber
thick
tight
white
head
forms
drops
behind
some
nice
lacing
good
retention
retains
a
pretty
thick
ring
smell
is
a
bit
sharp
honey
brown
sugar
grains
lemons
light
floral
wheat
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
but
pleasant
enough
taste
is
weak
some
sweet
malt
biscuits
citrus
bite
wheat
sharp
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
refreshing
but
bland
a
great
summer
beer
drinkability
it
is
good
enough
though
i
had
higher
expectations
given
the
brand
and
the
fact
that
i
drank
it
while
brewing
my
own
american
wheat
i
hold
out
hope
that
i
can
give
this
beer
a
run
for
the
money
overall
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
not
one
of
the
better
brews
from
anchor
it
wasnt
bad
and
id
certainly
have
another
if
offered
but
i
most
likely
will
not
be
purchasing
this
one
again
d
dissapointed
again
bland
and
boring
easy
to
drink
many
but
not
much
pleasure
out
of
it
so
many
better
options
out
there
heading
back
to
the
weinestephaner
drinkability
not
too
bad
it
feels
somewhat
bland
but
goes
down
well
and
could
make
a
good
session
ale
average
at
best
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
nice
white
very
fluffy
head
that
diminishes
to
a
white
film
aroma
is
yeasty
and
malty
flavor
is
the
same
lacing
on
glass
was
minimal
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
with
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
d
i
could
probably
drink
a
number
of
these
at
a
baseball
game
out
in
the
sun
etc
its
easy
to
drink
however
id
probably
rather
something
else
i
really
enjoy
other
anchor
steam
brews
so
i
guess
my
expectations
were
high
for
this
it
just
didnt
do
much
for
me
i
plan
to
give
it
another
shot
sometime
may
revise
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
good
carbonation
and
body
refreshing
when
cold
just
doesnt
really
hit
the
spot
d
this
is
a
disappointingly
average
beer
its
really
a
halfhearted
attempt
at
a
wheat
beer
thats
too
simple
in
its
style
overall
this
didnt
stand
out
in
any
way
and
i
was
pretty
disappointed
overall
an
ok
beer
a
good
purchase
but
i
doubt
that
i
will
purchase
it
again
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
though
recommended
sampled
fresh
at
the
brewery
after
the
tour
noticeably
better
and
fresher
than
bottled
back
in
tx
medium
golden
color
with
bright
white
head
definite
lacing
smell
is
of
eggy
foam
kind
of
like
a
fresh
meringue
kind
of
unappealing
crisp
wheaty
honey
taste
and
a
medium
length
finish
along
with
the
eggy
flavor
again
decent
and
easy
to
drink
but
there
was
a
flavor
in
this
that
once
i
picked
up
i
couldnt
really
enjoy
it
any
more
i
remember
liking
this
one
alot
more
maybe
it
was
the
hot
weather
at
the
time
really
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
possibly
just
not
when
there
is
snow
on
the
ground
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
nice
lighter
beer
but
there
are
several
others
that
i
would
pick
first
the
feel
is
watery
and
sour
like
a
lemondrop
its
a
really
sour
puckery
summer
brew
really
refreshing
and
nice
nothing
too
memorable
here
although
i
will
give
it
another
shot
in
the
summer
months
when
it
would
be
fresher
and
could
really
hit
the
spot
pours
a
honey
golden
opaque
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
with
a
fair
amount
of
good
sticky
lace
weak
slight
spiced
aroma
very
bland
spicepepper
taste
what
saves
it
is
the
light
sharp
crisp
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
have
had
much
better
and
dont
think
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
almost
seems
like
a
kolsch
for
this
wheatsummer
ale
not
bad
but
really
not
the
special
refreshing
and
i
wonder
if
i
would
appreciate
this
more
given
the
correct
season
this
is
better
than
the
average
american
wheat
ale
and
this
one
does
seem
to
drift
towards
the
bavarian
styles
without
really
going
there
do
like
the
bavarians
much
better
but
this
isnt
bad
clean
yellow
hazy
gold
color
fresh
nose
satisfying
flavor
body
and
finish
easy
drinking
d
maybe
in
august
after
mowing
the
grass
this
would
be
a
good
thirstquencher
but
as
i
sit
here
tonight
even
as
a
fan
of
malt
i
am
happy
to
have
experienced
yet
another
unique
brew
however
i
wont
be
actively
seeking
more
it
is
a
clear
golden
colored
beer
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
spotty
lacing
this
is
a
dark
wheat
beer
and
not
the
witbier
i
have
been
accustomed
to
the
aroma
is
biscuits
and
yeasty
malt
the
taste
is
malty
with
no
bitterness
noted
not
what
i
expected
from
a
wheat
ale
i
did
not
like
it
at
all
it
is
light
bodied
and
lightly
carbonated
leaves
a
bit
of
an
unappetizing
lingering
aftertaste
time
to
put
this
one
to
bed
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
especially
in
the
heat
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
clear
shade
of
pale
gold
a
fluffy
white
head
of
half
a
finger
lots
of
nice
lacing
quite
nice
the
aroma
is
very
much
anchor
which
i
respect
but
dont
like
all
much
wheat
hay
and
earthy
things
are
prominent
in
both
aroma
and
taste
some
citrus
in
the
latter
like
lemongrass
the
mouth
is
probably
the
most
pleasant
thing
about
this
beer
at
once
smooth
crisp
and
a
bit
grainy
in
the
finish
in
all
its
one
more
anchor
beer
i
dont
like
but
would
still
drink
my
weird
lovehate
thing
with
em
but
its
a
cool
bottle
nice
design
hope
the
recycling
guys
like
it
overall
an
decent
enough
brew
pretty
drinkable
when
chilled
worth
a
try
of
all
the
anchor
beers
out
there
this
is
the
plops
pours
an
uninspiring
haze
with
low
foam
taste
is
refreshing
but
lacks
any
character
not
much
else
to
say
except
that
i
wasted
my
money
on
a
whole
sixer
pass
on
this
and
get
a
real
beer
shame
like
so
many
summer
brews
this
is
good
for
a
hot
day
easy
drinking
but
then
there
are
so
many
more
that
are
notches
higher
grains
malts
hints
of
citrus
light
crisp
hops
wheat
flavor
is
muted
and
not
as
full
or
rich
as
i
like
for
the
style
alcohol
is
surprisingly
noticeable
at
only
4
6
beer
pours
a
crisp
pale
golden
color
smell
is
a
lemony
hoppy
smell
balance
of
wheat
and
hops
is
very
smooth
taste
is
crisp
and
a
wheat
and
lemon
flavor
i
also
tasted
a
slight
pinch
of
honey
and
molasses
nice
touch
on
a
wheat
beer
carbonation
is
smooth
and
we
had
no
trouble
putting
this
6
pack
away
while
watching
some
baseball
great
summer
beverage
d
i
had
no
problems
drinking
this
beer
it
would
be
a
good
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
other
summer
beers
i
prefer
not
a
horrible
buy
though
for
me
in
summary
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
theres
wheat
beers
out
there
that
have
more
going
on
drinkability
low
abv
makes
this
sessionable
i
just
dont
really
want
to
drink
many
an
ok
beer
that
is
good
on
a
hot
day
but
i
only
find
myself
wanting
one
or
two
this
is
your
typicalmediocrerunofthemill
wheat
beer
nothing
makes
it
stand
apart
and
it
has
minor
irritants
to
boot
bland
good
enough
to
have
one
or
two
on
a
hot
day
but
so
are
so
many
better
ones
d
very
drinkable
especially
in
summer
weather
i
easily
went
through
the
6pack
i
bought
and
i
might
get
more
while
this
heat
lasts
tried
this
again
on
82708
the
smell
is
mustier
than
i
remembered
it
the
watery
consistency
is
also
quite
pronounced
my
review
hasnt
changed
still
an
average
take
well
id
take
this
over
a
budweiser
on
just
about
any
day
but
only
just
so
a
really
lackluster
beer
from
an
otherwise
great
brewery
pass
on
this
beer
d
uh
not
good
this
is
a
very
odd
beer
and
not
in
a
good
way
there
are
two
factions
at
war
here
the
acrid
pilssaaz
pepper
hops
vs
the
sweet
yeasty
fresh
baked
bread
sadly
the
saazpils
army
spoils
what
could
have
been
a
tasty
yeasty
wheat
beer
this
is
not
bad
but
it
sure
aint
good
taste
is
very
light
with
lots
of
the
banana
and
a
bit
of
bready
yeast
zingy
peppery
bite
nice
sour
almost
lemony
character
not
complex
but
it
is
what
it
is
a
refreshing
light
summer
beer
that
has
a
lot
of
flavour
not
overcarbonated
in
the
mouth
and
lightly
dry
enjoyable
not
mindblowing
d
good
and
drinkable
you
should
expect
more
from
an
american
pale
wheat
but
as
a
summer
seasonal
it
fits
the
bill
nicely
not
the
best
of
example
of
this
style
but
a
good
offering
form
anchor
a
disappointing
beer
american
wheat
beers
always
leave
me
with
an
emptiness
that
they
could
have
done
such
a
better
job
ill
have
to
try
and
get
my
hands
on
some
gumball
and
a
few
others
to
sway
my
opinion
all
in
all
a
very
solid
summer
beer
i
would
love
to
drink
more
of
it
pours
a
clean
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
hung
around
for
a
bit
it
had
a
subtle
pilsner
style
hop
aroma
which
i
thought
was
a
nice
change
in
the
taste
malty
kind
of
well
just
there
it
is
a
smooth
beer
expecting
more
bitterness
to
it
compared
to
the
nose
not
all
that
exciting
bot
it
was
ok
taste
of
wheat
and
biscuity
caramalts
which
is
a
little
dextrinous
a
medium
malt
backbone
some
off
flavors
produced
by
the
yeast
medicinal
and
yeasty
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
sweet
aftertaste
is
a
dry
biscuity
taste
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
yellow
almost
orange
with
a
decent
sized
head
the
aroma
is
of
earthy
hops
against
wheat
and
some
sweet
fruits
the
taste
is
almost
like
a
wellhopped
hefeweizen
good
earthy
citrus
hops
blend
nicely
with
sweet
fruits
and
bubble
gum
the
beer
is
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
summer
beer
that
would
make
for
a
good
session
poured
a
glass
out
of
a
1pt
6oz
bottle
from
bevmo
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
about
2
inches
of
foam
after
an
aggressive
pour
foam
dissolved
very
slowly
leaving
a
lot
of
lacing
hint
of
malt
in
the
nose
i
was
going
to
give
a
higher
rating
on
the
nose
because
it
started
out
promising
however
by
the
end
of
the
glass
there
wasnt
much
aroma
left
the
taste
has
a
malty
edge
to
it
with
a
slight
bitterness
however
the
bitterness
doesnt
seem
to
be
hops
induced
nice
beer
what
budweiser
and
miller
claim
to
be
making
but
better
living
in
san
francisco
i
will
always
give
kudos
to
anchor
a
nice
beer
however
this
ale
has
all
the
markings
of
an
american
lager
d
as
a
beer
styled
for
summer
the
light
body
makes
for
one
of
those
refreshing
kind
of
libations
for
the
heat
but
the
flavor
characteristics
just
arent
enough
to
really
make
for
a
truly
tasty
beverage
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
light
clear
gold
forming
a
very
thin
white
head
medium
spots
of
lace
dot
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
smelling
very
floral
like
hops
but
i
suppose
thats
the
wheat
its
too
light
to
make
a
definite
destinction
the
taste
is
very
light
and
crisp
wheat
malt
and
maybe
some
hops
very
light
but
refreshing
light
smooth
mouthfeel
very
smooth
finish
low
abv
and
decent
flavor
makes
for
a
good
summer
ale
if
i
had
a
yard
to
mow
i
could
see
having
this
ready
for
when
i
finished
good
offering
from
anchor
the
taste
has
the
wheat
flavour
and
some
citrus
hop
in
the
background
that
comes
over
mostly
as
lemon
zest
its
kind
of
tasty
but
theres
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
so
i
wouldnt
bother
with
a
repurchase
not
one
of
anchors
better
brews
imho
drinkability
vert
drinkable
summertime
brew
great
feel
and
light
flavor
ill
definately
keep
this
one
in
mind
when
im
goin
to
be
drinking
in
warm
weather
and
i
want
a
light
wheat
beer
that
still
has
character
the
beer
poured
gold
and
clear
with
a
fine
white
head
that
stayed
throughout
a
pretty
standard
sour
malt
and
hops
aroma
the
taste
is
light
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
feel
is
light
and
dry
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
im
not
sure
what
the
object
was
here
but
my
first
thought
was
hey
this
is
like
pearl
or
jax
or
maybe
even
falstaff
but
brewed
with
better
materials
in
a
smaller
batch
i
wouldnt
be
adverse
to
one
if
offered
as
it
is
a
bit
nostalgic
but
not
one
id
pursue
drinkability
it
finishes
without
lingering
but
with
a
slightly
sandy
texture
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
and
this
isnt
swaying
my
prejudice
the
aroma
holds
toasted
wheat
grain
and
light
malt
notes
the
body
is
a
light
goldenyellow
and
holds
a
lasting
thumb
thick
white
head
light
bodied
fore
features
mild
citrus
notes
toasted
wheat
and
malt
and
a
clean
crisp
finish
quite
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
summer
brew
with
a
fair
amount
of
flavor
to
satisfy
the
palate
i
would
only
drink
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
though
since
the
flavors
arent
very
pronounced
pours
a
very
golden
straw
color
very
little
head
that
quickly
disapates
the
aroma
is
somewhat
light
wheat
grains
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus
there
is
almost
too
much
carbonation
for
me
but
you
get
used
to
it
the
taste
is
pretty
mellow
bitter
and
grainy
finishes
crisp
and
dry
not
great
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
a
forgetable
beer
nothing
that
stands
out
at
all
and
not
nearly
as
good
as
many
other
american
wheats
out
there
its
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
a
whole
lot
if
you
sitting
outside
in
the
summer
heat
drinking
with
a
few
friends
and
just
want
to
drink
a
beer
that
you
dont
have
to
think
about
it
may
be
good
other
than
that
id
pass
on
it
tasty
at
first
but
a
bit
of
astringency
in
the
aftertaste
suffers
from
a
lack
of
hopping
as
well
this
beer
is
is
too
one
dimensional
and
lifeless
as
expected
overcarbonation
is
an
issue
in
the
texture
many
better
summer
brews
are
availbable
i
too
am
a
bit
let
down
by
anchor
here
pale
yellow
brilliantly
clear
and
sparkling
with
carbonation
the
head
is
thick
thanks
to
the
wheat
but
disappointingly
small
clean
sweetish
aroma
of
wheaty
grain
very
mild
a
bit
of
perfumy
lemon
and
a
tangy
wheat
presence
along
with
a
nice
lingering
fresh
graininess
light
bodied
refreshing
and
moderately
dry
it
serves
its
purpose
it
might
not
justify
its
pricetag
a
surprisingly
insipid
brew
i
had
expected
more
from
anchor
in
terms
of
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
wont
get
you
plastered
too
quickly
so
you
can
easily
drink
several
but
its
not
one
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
really
no
better
than
a
higher
end
macro
lager
to
tell
the
truth
essentially
a
michelob
with
a
lemon
not
impressed
but
i
guess
every
brewers
got
its
duds
the
flavor
is
far
less
complex
leading
with
bracing
citrus
then
going
to
a
round
and
smooth
brassy
character
for
grassy
hops
to
play
on
crackery
grain
finish
as
far
as
flavor
i
dont
get
much
from
the
actual
wheat
in
this
beer
which
is
a
little
disappointing
overall
i
would
say
this
is
hardly
an
apa
in
my
mind
i
am
rating
it
highly
because
i
like
that
it
takes
things
in
a
direction
other
than
puckering
astringency
and
citrus
d
clean
crisp
refreshing
summer
beer
good
drinkability
d
just
a
simple
clean
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
sessionable
wheat
beer
very
solid
choice
nicely
crafted
i
would
liken
this
to
drinking
a
hoegaarden
nothing
spectacular
but
a
perfectly
drinkable
every
day
beer
light
summer
drinker
very
light

not
really
wheaty

more
like
a
lager
pours
a
clear
bright
golden
color
with
an
eggshell
white
foamy
head
aromas
of
lemons
and
pungent
toasted
bread
pale
malts
on
the
palate
sweet
malts
then
a
flash
of
acidity
before
the
two
elements
come
crashing
together
in
the
finish
which
is
simultaneously
malty
and
citric
mouthfeel
is
light
but
the
malt
element
weighs
things
down
a
tad
overall
this
is
a
decent
drinkable
wheat
beer
something
that
is
thirst
quenching
and
easy
to
drink
it
strikes
me
as
a
good
microbrew
gateway
beer
pours
out
like
hazy
slightly
underripe
mango
flesh
a
fluffy
white
head
settles
to
a
thin
but
impressive
head
leaves
spotty
lacing
nose
is
of
peach
apricot
mango
papaya
and
melon
with
some
cracked
wheat
grain
flavor
is
nectarine
with
grain
in
the
background
some
bread
and
honey
ends
dry
with
a
mild
astringency
and
kiss
of
blueberry
light
body
with
kind
of
weak
carbonation
drinkability
is
fine
but
there
are
more
interesting
examples
of
the
style
very
drinkable
in
that
you
can
slug
several
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
stuff
great
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
very
well
and
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
smell
is
nice
and
wheaty
and
citrus
the
taste
is
a
balance
of
what
with
a
nice
sweet
start
that
is
citrusy
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
to
finish
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
i
may
visit
this
again
in
the
summertime
pours
a
hazy
straw
hue
generating
an
extra
thick
and
creamy
snowwhite
head
outstanding
retention
with
lasting
rings
of
sticky
lace
malted
wheat
and
pale
malt
nose
otherwise
clean
the
soft
sweetness
of
the
wheat
is
immediatly
recognized
upon
first
sip
with
extra
pale
malt
in
its
shadow
very
clean
almost
lagerlike
yeast
character
possibly
a
hint
of
pepper
or
a
slight
tannic
taste
from
wheat
malt
very
faint
ale
fruitiness
in
the
afteraste
and
blank
hop
bitterness
balance
the
flavor
well
mediumlight
body
with
lots
of
texture
from
the
wheat
and
moderately
carbonated
for
a
just
barely
crisp
mouthfeel
fanatstic
drinkability
but
this
is
partly
because
of
the
lack
of
character
a
good
example
of
a
boring
style
imo
but
well
puttogether
di
like
thisi
would
like
to
try
a
newer
bottle
i
dont
know
how
long
this
bottle
was
sitting
in
the
2
buck
barrel
its
not
bad
at
allthe
worst
part
is
the
smell
and
i
can
deal
with
that
ide
like
to
try
again
clear
golden
appearance

medium
thick
white
head
last
kind
of
long
nose
is
very
very
light
skunk
rice
grass
hopps
and
hay

taste
of
straw
corn
light
wheat
and
and
yeast
sparkly
body
however
dry
body

aftertaste
slightly
sweet
skunky
and
earthy
bitter
like
dirt
this
is
a
light
uncomplex
beer
that
while
not
mindblowing
is
a
very
satisfying
drink
for
one
in
need
of
some
good
ol
refreshment
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
there
are
superior
american
pale
wheat
ales
out
there
this
would
not
be
among
my
top
ten
for
the
style
but
still
worth
a
try
eric
light
gold
and
crystal
clear
topped
by
a
big
fluffy
bright
white
head
off
an
average
pour
as
the
foam
subsides
clumpy
lace
stuck
to
the
glass
fair
retention
crackery
wheat
aroma
with
light
lemony
citrus
and
floral
hops
mild
flavour
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
initially
creamy
texture
but
the
body
and
flavour
fall
away
towards
the
end
leaving
it
feeling
thin
light
lingering
lemon
flavour
its
refreshing
yet
not
very
impressive
especially
considering
the
thinness
otherwise
this
would
be
a
much
better
summer
beer
although
i
would
classify
this
as
a
refreshing
beer
its
probably
only
because
i
was
drinking
it
outside
in
the
sun
on
a
warm
day
this
reminded
me
a
bit
of
lemon
water
which
is
great
in
the
right
setting
i
was
just
expecting
more
the
pour
was
smooth
the
color
light
copper
and
capped
with
a
white
airy
head
the
smell
was
rich
with
wheat
and
a
hint
of
fruit
taste
was
vibrant
tangy
with
some
apricot
undertones
this
beer
is
refreshingly
smooth
with
a
nice
quite
pale
wheat
finish
a
nice
drinkable
summer
selection
worth
a
try
12
oz
stubby
bowling
pin
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
back
the
beer
has
a
bright
gold
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
and
smells
mainly
of
tangy
wheat
it
is
light
on
the
palate
with
a
combination
of
wheat
peppercoriander
and
just
enough
leafygreen
hops
to
balance
it
is
light
on
flavor
and
goes
down
almost
like
water
though
the
flavor
gradually
increases
as
it
warms
not
anything
great
but
its
an
easy
drinker
that
im
sure
paved
the
way
for
many
present
pale
wheat
ales
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
abundant
white
puffy
head
very
nice
lacing
smell
is
lemoncitrus
and
very
tantalizing
taste
id
a
bit
dissapointing
in
that
while
very
refreshing
there
is
nothing
that
really
stands
out
about
excellent
drinkability
but
a
bit
boring
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
thats
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
i
think
it
will
make
a
good
summer
time
session
beer
beer
pours
to
a
nice
goldenpale
with
light
head
that
does
not
last
long
scent
is
not
strong
but
is
refreshingly
malty
and
sweet
light
honeysweet
taste
and
little
grainy
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
bit
dry
even
with
the
bitter
aftertaste
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
for
a
wheat
beer
perfect
for
the
summer
and
great
drinkability
as
my
first
anchor
beer
it
definitely
makes
me
want
to
try
another
disappointed
ultimately
probably
because
of
the
agecondition
of
the
bottle
d
i
will
definately
get
this
again
very
refreshing
and
light
with
enough
of
a
hop
kick
for
a
hophead
d
good
drinkability
on
a
hot
texas
summer
day
d
easy
drinker
nothing
substantial
stands
out
in
this
beer
just
fairly
straight
forward
d
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
have
yet
to
try
it
from
a
bottle
but
i
thought
is
was
quite
good
on
tap
drinkabilityoverall
kind
of
boring
more
of
a
pilsener
than
an
apwa
at
the
same
time
totally
drinkable
and
inoffensive
still
expected
a
little
more
character
from
anchor
drinkability
this
decent
not
great
it
goes
down
well
and
is
very
sessionable
drinkability
not
as
complex
as
anchors
other
beers
and
certainly
not
as
impressive
but
nonetheless
an
immensely
drinkable
and
pleasant
summer
beer
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
a
lot
more
of
this
given
the
near100
degree
week
were
having
worth
a
try
for
a
summer
cooler
and
went
down
well
with
spicy
wings
excellent
beer
for
a
hot
summer
evening
would
make
a
decent
session
ale
also
this
is
one
to
let
your
macrodrinking
friends
try
because
theyre
sure
to
enjoy
it
its
not
like
you
can
expect
them
to
make
the
shift
directly
to
an
imperial
stout
although
i
have
tried
really
just
to
see
the
look
on
their
face
when
they
realize
that
there
is
beer
out
there
that
tastes
quite
different
from
miller
lite
light
yellowstraw
color
clear
not
too
exciting
but
it
has
a
nice
full
head
that
sticks
around
leaving
a
good
lace
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
just
a
pleasant
bready
smell
a
bit
macroish
perhaps
the
taste
is
bready
and
not
really
that
fruity
maybe
just
a
hint
of
lemon
hops
are
present
but
not
strong
the
finish
leaves
a
slight
sourness
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
light
but
not
watery
the
carbonation
is
almost
too
strong
though
a
nice
drinkable
brew
for
hot
weather
but
not
much
here
to
keep
you
interested
d
which
leads
to
a
high
drinkability
very
easy
even
for
a
macro
drinker
drinks
fairly
easy
nothing
special
but
the
forebear
of
many
very
good
beers
of
this
style
deserves
a
try
just
a
baseline
if
nothing
else
poured
into
a
glass
a
nice
large
white
foamy
head
forms
atop
a
dark
yellow
beer
the
smell
is
kind
of
sour
not
very
inviting
the
taste
is
pretty
good
you
can
definitly
taste
the
wheat
influences
with
a
small
small
touch
of
lemon
for
a
summer
seasonal
it
has
many
layers
of
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
crisp
carbonated
and
refreshing
feeling
everything
a
summer
beer
should
be
this
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
summer
seasonal
i
enjoy
the
wheat
i
think
it
gives
it
an
extra
touch
that
makes
this
seasonal
all
worth
it
bottle
from
lubière
poured
a
yellowwhite
color
beer
with
a
huge
pure
white
bubbly
head
with
good
retention
aroma
of
bubblegum
and
banana
is
just
sublime
on
this
hot
summer
day
taste
is
refreshing
with
a
nice
crisp
presence
of
wheat
and
some
discreet
hops
in
the
background
very
well
done
for
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
during
summer
not
sure
why
the
rating
are
so
low
for
this
beer
i
can
understand
why
people
are
so
underwhelmed
with
this
brew
especially
since
it
is
the
weak
link
in
this
brewerys
offerings
and
is
downright
pricey
that
being
said
id
totally
make
this
an
outdoordrinking
staple
if
it
werent
priced
so
prohibitively
also
a
good
transitory
or
trainingwheel
beer
an
unassuming
summer
option
but
pricey
here
on
the
east
cost
a
good
choice
for
hot
weather
drinkin
pours
a
pale
clear
golden
color
with
tons
of
head
frothy
fluffy
head
some
nice
lacing
around
the
glass
smell
is
malty
and
sweet
a
cotton
candy
type
thing
going
on
also
a
bready
and
biscuityness
in
there
taste
is
light
quite
malty
and
more
breadyness
quite
light
mouthfeel
is
sudsy
and
chewy
and
on
the
dry
side
ultimately
a
light
and
refreshing
brew
but
there
are
others
in
this
style
id
prefer
to
have
not
my
favorite
anchor
product
and
my
review
speaks
for
itself
this
one
misses
the
mark
absolutely
topclass
american
wheat
though
i
much
prefer
a
german
or
belgian
wheat
theres
a
lot
to
like
about
this
beer
very
refreshing
in
the
summer
goo
drinkability
in
the
right
context
not
what
im
gonna
go
for
when
i
wanna
savor
something
but
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
for
a
warm
day
when
you
want
something
simple
drinkability
a
drinkable
enough
beer
got
a
good
smoothness
but
there
better
choices
for
summer
beers
this
stuff
aint
cheap
a
very
nice
wheat
ale
the
perfect
summer
brew
pale
crystal
clear
gold
topped
with
a
creamy
white
head
good
retention
clean
aroma
dominated
by
sourish
wheat
and
citrusy
earthy
hops
very
crisp
flavor
light
bodied
with
snappy
carbonation
this
stuff
is
perfectly
designed
to
toss
back
in
sweltering
heat
very
clean
with
a
simple
flavor
consisting
mostly
of
wheat
and
a
bit
of
lemonlime
in
the
finish
the
wheat
contributes
to
a
satisfyingly
dry
finish
mildy
hopped
and
quenching
not
a
lot
going
on
but
its
a
great
beer
for
sipping
in
the
summer
months
a
decent
summer
wheat
bright
and
clear
solid
yellow
body
with
a
medium
white
head
aroma
is
just
the
slightest
bit
sulphury
with
a
crisp
maltwheat
smell
and
a
whisp
of
floral
hops
very
light
palate
and
an
accordingly
light
flavor
crisp
malt
is
in
the
taste
too
but
the
floral
hops
are
a
bit
more
prominent
on
the
tongue
than
they
were
in
the
nose
nice
fizzy
carbonation
complements
the
light
body
well
this
beer
is
what
the
american
lager
style
should
have
been
yes
i
know
its
a
wheat
ale
this
is
not
one
of
those
beers
that
knocks
my
socks
off
in
a
way
that
would
make
me
seek
it
out
but
it
is
an
eminently
drinkable
summer
quaff
notes
another
in
a
long
line
of
beers
that
ive
had
numerous
times
but
never
bothered
to
jot
down
a
note
ive
always
enjoyed
this
brew
and
for
those
that
have
had
the
session
premium
lager
from
full
sail
i
find
this
to
be
similar
although
a
bit
lighter
in
every
way
this
is
a
pretty
average
wheat
pale
ale
you
shouldnt
turn
up
your
nose
at
it
but
there
are
better
options
out
there
golden
yellow
color
white
head
that
drops
to
a
thin
film
that
sticks
around
very
active
carbonation
gives
this
a
nice
lively
appearance
smell
of
light
wheat
malts
lemon
zest
and
some
yeastyness
that
gives
it
a
little
bit
of
a
bread
note
overall
the
smell
is
on
the
faint
side
taste
is
pretty
bland
the
high
carbonation
level
covers
up
the
little
bit
of
flavor
that
tries
to
come
through
some
wheat
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
spicyness
and
some
lemon
zest
are
there
if
you
really
look
for
it
the
finish
is
very
dry
overall
just
an
average
beer
might
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
are
just
lookign
for
something
to
wet
you
mouth
but
on
2nd
thought
there
are
many
better
choices
the
only
redeeming
quality
the
active
appearance
due
to
the
high
carbonation
level
ends
up
being
a
detriment
when
it
comes
to
taste
this
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
very
slight
with
only
a
hint
of
citrus
malt
the
taste
has
some
citrus
hops
and
malt
along
with
abit
of
wheat
flavors
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
the
mf
is
light
with
a
good
balance
of
wheat
and
malt
flavors
this
is
a
pretty
good
tasting
beer
but
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
a
light
amber
colored
beer
with
an
offwhite
colored
head
that
leaves
behind
some
lacing
aromas
of
grains
bread
fresh
fruit
and
pine
seem
apparent
to
me
the
taste
is
a
delicious
blend
of
fruity
tartness
and
sweetness
its
quite
refreshing
as
might
be
expected
for
a
wheat
beer
with
a
dry
bitter
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
high
with
this
beer
because
of
the
low
abv
and
enjoyable
flavors
pretty
nice
brew
here
pale
golden
wheat
with
a
thin
white
crown
of
quickly
receding
head
leaving
an
uneven
film
maintained
fairly
well
by
a
decent
amount
of
bubbles
rising
in
towers
buttered
bread
smells
are
light
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
light
malt
notes
accompanied
by
apples
and
a
slight
lemmoncitrus
twang
ended
with
just
a
small
biscuit
tone
hops
are
welcome
to
an
otherewise
good
but
nonexceptional
brew
leaving
a
fairly
clean
but
not
crisp
finish
malts
open
as
it
warms
thank
god
light
body
and
delicate
carbonation
for
a
very
refreshing
brew
highly
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
good
representation
of
style
imo
though
mouthfeel
was
smooth
yeat
spicy
with
nice
carbonation
aftertaste
is
a
bit
bitter
for
my
liking
definitely
would
be
a
tasty
beverage
in
the
summer
time
possibly
during
a
baseball
game
or
even
an
early
season
football
game
here
in
the
south
drinkability
was
purely
average
there
are
plenty
of
other
wheats
id
go
for
preferentially
but
i
wouldnt
completely
turn
my
nose
up
at
this
one
if
offered
one
at
a
gettogether
while
not
a
star
if
any
show
it
is
a
real
nice
summer
beer
not
run
of
the
mill
and
not
a
standout
its
crisp
refreshing
and
inviting
but
it
still
suffers
ever
so
slightly
from
its
innate
thinness
that
falls
just
short
of
genuinely
impressing
but
wanting
more
actually
helps
make
this
drinkable
and
thats
good
because
it
can
slake
a
thirst
in
spite
of
any
shortcomings
in
the
heat
in
the
sun
id
have
no
issue
with
one
in
the
hand
and
one
waiting
in
the
bush
or
something
wasnt
completely
what
i
expected
for
a
summer
beer
i
felt
that
it
was
a
bit
to
hoppy
for
my
taste
pours
a
nice
golden
with
a
good
head
that
recedes
very
quickly
smells
of
hops
with
a
tinge
of
alcohol
tastes
very
hoppy
for
the
style
of
beer
this
is
i
personally
think
there
is
way
to
much
hops
in
it
mild
wheat
in
the
finish
definately
a
light
bodied
brew
thats
good
for
drinking
on
a
hot
day
this
is
one
of
very
few
beers
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
out
of
the
bottle
my
last
of
the
regular
anchor
beers
to
review
other
than
the
back
cataolgue
of
osas
very
light
colored
body
ellow
and
slightly
hazy
the
head
is
very
creamy
and
full
on
the
pour
fading
to
leave
a
nice
creamy
layer
of
foam
atop
the
beer
a
little
skunky
malt
and
slight
banana
in
the
nose
taste
is
skunky
and
old
tasting
metallic
and
unappealing
rather
offensive
to
the
taste
buds
mouthfeel
is
poorly
carbonated
this
is
not
up
to
anchor
quality
i
will
suggest
you
pass
on
this
beer
and
get
the
other
anchor
offerings
i
felt
a
bit
let
down
by
this
beer
but
in
no
way
does
that
mean
it
isnt
good
i
just
felt
it
could
have
been
better
poured
out
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
medium
carbonation
and
some
minor
lacing
around
the
glass
aromas
of
malt
wheat
and
a
slightly
skunked
character
taste
was
decent
enought
but
slightly
weak
flavors
of
citrus
lemon
grain
malt
and
hops
better
definition
would
be
a
nice
improvement
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
zesty
not
bad
drinkability
id
have
this
again
maybe
next
year
some
minor
changes
could
result
in
major
gains
worth
a
try
pricey
and
disappointing

good

tangy
toasty
bitter
although
light
and
drinkabel
this
version
is
tough
to
have
again
a
disappointing
offering
from
anchor
but
this
style
is
tough
to
pull
off
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
with
decent
head
retention
nose
is
grassy
upon
first
impression
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
lemon
there
taste
is
crisp
and
cleansing
of
the
palate
very
wheaty
as
categorized
mouthfeel
is
full
and
fairly
lively
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
little
session
beer
that
i
would
recommend
did
me
good
on
a
hot
beach
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
and
has
surprisingly
little
carbonation
when
you
look
at
its
enormous
head
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
mouthfeel
has
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
a
crisp
refreshing
body
that
goes
down
easy
not
bad
if
youre
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
brew
but
id
rather
have
a
good
kolsch
or
pilsener
over
this
anyday
overall
this
is
a
lame
beer
that
did
nothing
for
me
it
doesnt
taste
bad
and
it
can
be
drunk
if
you
were
desperate
but
id
never
purchase
one
on
my
own
power
again
nothing
going
for
it
and
yet
nothing
really
against
it
either
very
disappointing
pours
a
medium
gold
with
a
good
2
finger
head
good
longevity
and
very
good
lace
aromas
of
a
faint
yeast
what
malt
a
bit
lemony
and
some
decent
hop
floralness
a
good
wheat
malt
flavor
mixed
with
some
mild
citrus
flavors
some
banana
flavors
are
also
present
a
bit
watery
though
spritzy
and
high
carbonation
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
a
decent
american
wheat
but
there
are
better
versions
out
there
drinkability
look
elsewhere
especially
for
the
price
there
are
better
wheats
to
be
had
kind
of
a
bummer
to
drink
this
knowing
its
an
anchor
but
ill
make
it
up
and
have
a
liberty
ale
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
small
head
of
white
foam
that
fades
quickly
to
a
wisp
on
top
considering
this
is
a
summer
wheat
beer
it
leaves
a
pretty
frothy
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mild
and
malty
with
some
citrussy
aspects
taste
is
a
real
smooth
light
crisp
beer
it
has
some
sourness
but
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
there
is
nothing
to
mention
on
mouthfeel
other
than
the
smoothness
and
crispness
quite
a
drinkable
summer
beer
i
like
the
fact
that
the
fruity
essences
are
handled
very
gently
nothing
is
too
overpowering
here
dthis
beer
taste
more
like
a
light
german
pils
than
an
american
pale
wheat
it
is
missing
many
of
the
wheat
characteristics
that
it
needs
to
enhance
this
beer
and
give
it
depth
after
a
few
hours
sweating
in
the
backyard
i
thought
the
summer
ale
would
be
perfect
man
was
i
wrong
i
believe
a
cold
miller
lite
would
have
been
better
very
malty
with
a
grassy
aftertaste
warmed
up
quickly
and
this
made
it
very
hard
to
finish
from
a
brewery
that
impresses
me
this
one
was
a
disappointment
cute
little
anchor
bottle
pour
is
very
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
whipped
egg
white
head
that
doesnt
last
smell
is
musty
with
some
sulfur
and
veggies
kinda
like
a
bad
cologne
decomposing
lemons
are
present
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
overall
reminds
me
of
a
american
macro
lager
with
sweaty
gym
sock
and
citrus
the
flavor
starts
off
decently
but
the
finish
is
just
awful
no
thanks
anchor
summer
beer
is
a
little
lacking
in
a
few
areas
but
this
is
still
a
decent
summer
beer
considering
what
is
available
here
simple
clean
crisp
dn
i
dont
know
why
i
love
anchor
summer
beer
anchor
wheat
like
i
do
very
tasty
beer
uberrefreshing
crisp
and
clean
with
great
aromas
and
flavors
i
like
beers
that
have
me
scratching
my
head
trying
to
figure
it
out
and
this
on
has
it
in
spades
highly
recommended
drinkability
what
a
disappointment
i
have
truly
enjoyed
the
other
anchor
beers
but
this
one
is
way
too
light
and
flavorless
for
my
tastebuds
the
drinkability
level
with
this
beer
is
so
nice
its
so
quaffable
its
not
even
funny
i
polished
two
off
and
im
not
even
trying
a
truly
great
thirst
quenching
summertime
treat
maybe
a
tad
overpriced
but
a
solid
beer
nevertheless
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
for
a
wheat
at
least
but
it
is
not
a
redeeming
quality
id
be
able
to
drink
much
more
of
this
without
the
said
undescribable
tastesmell
keep
in
mind
i
love
wheat
beers
but
this
one
thoroughly
blows
it
sounds
barbaric
but
i
thought
this
was
better
straight
from
the
bottle
than
poured
i
got
less
of
a
shitty
tastearoma
that
way
buy
this
beer
at
your
own
risk
wheat
beer
lovers
and
completionists
alike
light
body
with
a
thin
but
grainey
mouthfeel
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
other
offerings
ive
had
from
anchor
not
very
exciting
but
this
could
make
for
a
good
backyard
beer
mouthfeel
very
carbonated
and
light
on
the
tongue
though
let
down
on
the
flavor
this
adds
to
the
drinkability
i
could
slug
several
of
these
whilst
fishing
or
doing
yard
work
otherwise
just
expect
more
drinkable
refreshing
but
not
up
to
anchor
standards
drinkability
the
second
anchor
beer
i
have
been
disappointed
with
this
and
the
small
beer
ill
stick
with
my
seirra
nevada
wheat
if
i
want
a
local
micro
of
this
style
a
clean
golden
yellow
beer
has
a
big
bright
white
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
good
lace
there
is
a
light
grainy
almost
wheat
cracker
aroma
with
a
hint
of
lemon
in
the
background
there
is
pretty
much
no
flavor
to
this
beer
there
is
a
tinge
of
lemon
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
a
light
dry
hop
finish
i
guess
this
would
be
better
ice
cold
in
the
summer
time
an
average
lager
all
around
but
a
belowaverage
brew
from
anchor
nice
golden
colour
with
a
big
head
of
white
foam
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
my
shaker
pint
aromas
are
of
grains
lemon
zest
and
slight
hops
taste
is
very
grainy
as
well
with
a
bit
of
a
biscuit
maltiness
in
the
middle
and
a
slightly
hoppy
lemony
finish
which
is
quite
flavorless
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
well
drinkability
is
good
too
truly
an
average
brew
from
an
aboveaverage
brewery
this
brew
poured
a
deep
gold
in
incandescent
lighting
with
shortlived
average
sized
head
the
aroma
was
typical
of
wheat
brews
a
citrusy
malt
the
taste
reminded
me
a
lot
of
boston
beers
gold
a
few
years
ago
on
tap
at
the
nowdefunct
sam
adams
brew
pub
philadelphia
it
was
clean
mildly
hoppy
with
lemony
undertones
mouthfeel
was
good
and
this
brew
goes
down
quite
easily
this
beer
was
a
little
hard
to
describe
for
me
which
is
unusal
for
wheat
beers
which
all
seem
to
share
certain
characteristics
this
isnt
a
spectacular
brew
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
from
anchor
drinkability
a
little
out
of
its
element
here
in
november
but
i
kinda
forgot
about
the
sixer
i
had
in
a
box
i
picked
up
from
a
trip
to
houston
i
needed
one
more
sixer
to
round
out
a
case
of
st
arnolds
sixers
no
problem
taking
care
of
these
though
they
are
tasty
this
beer
is
gold
yellow
in
color
steady
pour
generated
a
frothy
head
that
faded
fast
to
a
thin
layer
that
laced
the
glass
while
drinking
the
nose
is
crisp
malt
as
well
as
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
not
a
typical
wheat
almost
more
like
a
pilsner
i
also
enjoyed
the
label
anchor
summer
has
a
little
different
taste
than
the
wheat
beers
im
used
to
and
in
this
case
thats
a
good
thing
i
found
a
sweeter
malt
taste
than
i
was
expecting
with
any
beer
than
contains
wheat
appearance
is
classical
wheat
beer
a
strong
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
highly
carbonated
which
created
a
large
thick
head
aroma
here
is
strong
of
typical
hoppy
beer
smell
not
much
is
noted
of
wheat
aromas
taste
isnt
as
dry
or
wheaty
as
i
would
expect
however
this
beer
still
seems
to
work
well
as
a
thirst
quencher
the
middle
of
a
sip
is
more
malty
than
expected
nice
and
rounded
some
lemon
is
detected
in
the
finish
for
me
this
beer
was
a
nice
and
different
interpretation
of
the
wheat
style
another
beer
from
anchor
id
recommend
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
14
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
wheat
scent
with
some
lemon
in
there
as
well
the
yeast
adds
a
bit
of
fruitiness
to
it
the
taste
decent
it
has
a
very
clean
tasting
wheat
flavor
with
a
slight
lemony
edge
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
clean
and
mildly
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
by
far
not
the
best
summer
wheat
beer
ive
had
but
it
still
drinks
well
it
lacks
real
wheat
flavor
but
on
those
hot
summer
days
this
could
really
refresh
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
with
a
threefinger
pillowy
white
head
that
fades
slowly
a
good
lace
clear
pale
amber
color
lightmedium
bodied
nose
is
yeasty
if
anything
strong
carbonation
starts
sweet
and

feel
in
your
mouth
isnt
all
that
great
overall
i
would
have
another
but
i
think
their
steam
beer
is
much
better
ill
have
to
try
this
again
next
summer
to
see
if
the
recipe
changes
at
all
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
summer
brew
from
what
i
consider
to
be
one
the
most
solid
breweries
in
the
country
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
it
is
a
very
clean
and
crisp
beer
that
seems
to
go
perfect
with
a
hot
day
this
is
a
wheat
beer
but
i
dont
get
a
very
heavy
wheat
taste
subtle
malt
and
wheat
tones
set
the
pace
for
this
beer
and
the
overall
drinkability
is
excellent
this
would
definately
be
up
there
in
my
list
of
session
beers
overall
impression
drinkable
as
a
good
summer
beer
should
be
great
looks
but
a
bit
over
carbonated
to
be
a
good
thirst
quencher
enjoyable
but
i
wont
crave
another
extremely
drinkable
though
it
would
have
been
easy
to
put
away
quite
a
few
of
this
light
summertime
offering
try
this
on
your
friends
who
enjoy
light
beers
and
see
what
they
think
would
pair
nice
with
some
chicken
or
some
fish
a
good
backyard
beer
for
those
waning
summer
days
light
to
medium
bodied
very
frothy
though
temporarily
malty
and
lemon
twang
with
citrus
hop
and
grass
and
fruit
aroma
thin
but
like
anchor
above
average
carbonation
crisp
clean
and
bitter
aftertaste
pours
a
pleasant
light
amber
minimal
ephemeral
head
must
have
been
the
bartenders
method
on
tap
citrus
whiffs
immediately
blossomed
from
the
brew
taste
has
mild
hops
a
lot
of
citrus
and
a
little
tartness
very
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
leave
the
palette
nearly
clean
besides
a
slight
citrus
aftertaste
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
weak
weaker
weakest
anchor
may
have
brewed
the
worlds
first
antibeer
the
beer
worlds
answer
to
a
photographic
negative
if
you
dont
see
summer
beer
in
your
favorite
beer
store
try
not
to
remember
that
i
told
you
not
to
try
it
unless
you
dont
want
to
that
is
or
not
this
poured
a
bright
and
clear
brassy
golden
color
looks
like
a
golden
spritzer
a
beautiful
large
sticky
creamlike
head
that
looked
liked
stiffly
whipped
egg
whites
i
loved
watching
the
creamy
head
explode
after
the
pour
very
nice
the
aroma
has
lightly
soured
malts
and
a
soft
citrus
hop
bite
that
hits
the
nose
with
a
sweet
fruitiness
theres
a
sweet
strawberry
coming
through
thats
very
appealing
the
taste
is
sweet
light
and
tangy
beautifully
clean
and
fresh
tasting
has
some
buttery
texture
overall
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
simple
beer
very
refreshing
another
winner
from
anchor
the
head
looks
silky
and
smooth
but
wasnt
as
unusually
abundant
as
they
said
on
the
label
it
lasted
quite
long
on
the
very
slightly
hazy
yellow
orange
color
body
the
smell
i
found
weak
some
citrus
and
some
herbal
notes
the
wheat
not
being
really
noticeable
the
taste
was
very
round
and
dry
fruity
with
liquorice
and
herbs
it
reminded
me
more
of
whipped
eggs
than
the
head
some
sourness
more
refreshing
than
annoying
quite
enjoyable
and
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
the
fruitiness
is
humid
on
the
palate
but
the
hops
made
the
throat
dry
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
the
head
is
about
a
quarter
inch
but
fades
before
i
even
take
a
taste
contrary
to
what
the
label
says
the
beer
smells
sweet
and
slightly
malty
to
me
a
moderate
malt
flavor
comes
through
first
followed
by
a
refreshing
hop
finish
that
doesnt
linger
too
long
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
clean
crisp
and
just
heavy
enough
without
being
heavy
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
just
above
average
i
would
expect
just
a
little
less
malt
in
a
summer
beer
there
is
no
lacing
to
speak
of
as
i
drink
the
beer
down
this
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
beer
while
grilling
in
the
summer
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
it
were
given
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
lighlty
crisp
at
the
start
and
finish
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
this
is
lighter
bodied
and
is
light
on
the
carbonation
very
drinkable
a
definite
thirst
quencher
for
a
hot
day
pours
a
golden
pils
color
with
no
yeast
haziness
at
all
has
some
subdued
wheat
ale
characteristics
in
the
aroma
rather
thin
in
the
taste
but
i
suppose
if
one
was
drinking
seasonally
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
a
bit
more
oomph
myself
nonetheless
a
moderately
good
beer
but
lacks
a
certain
character
i
look
for
in
a
summer
thirstquencher
i
first
had
this
at
the
san
fran
beer
fest
and
hated
it
but
that
was
after
extended
stays
at
ommegang
unibroue
and
stonei
figured
it
deserved
another
shot
it
got
it
but
still
not
impressed
they
seem
quite
proud
that
its
the
usas
first
wheatmaybe
they
should
concentrate
a
bit
more
on
making
it
the
best
very
average
and
disappointing
for
an
anchor
some
aftertaste
saves
it
from
being
totally
bland
but
compared
to
other
good
wheat
beers
nothing
to
recommend
none
of
the
customary
fruitiness
typical
for
the
style
also
not
much
hops
compared
to
other
micro
wheat
ales
the
baltika
i
had
after
this
absolutely
blew
it
away
medium
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
slightly
sweet
lagerlike
nosecereal
grains
hops
not
noticable
very
mild
palate
wheat
malt
has
control
throughout
the
palate
soft
lingering
finish
quite
refreshing
light
mouthfeel
but
exactly
what
i
expected
nice
overall
a
super
easydrinking
summer
brew
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
more
easily
another
great
anchor
brew
drinkability
id
drink
it
but
im
sure
there
are
more
interesting
and
exciting
beers
out
there
there
werent
any
notes
that
arent
met
by
a
typical
pilsner
it
would
make
a
good
drink
on
a
hot
afternoon
but
i
dont
see
a
reason
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
your
hands
on
this
brew
bright
gold
with
frothy
head
that
dwindles
to
a
sudsy
ring
aroma
of
hay
and
light
lemony
hops
the
beer
is
smooth
and
initially
sweet
with
a
clean
and
ample
maltiness
wheat
plays
a
part
too
adding
a
slight
graininess
and
breadiness
hops
are
mellow
providing
slight
friction
and
very
little
bitterness
the
trademark
anchor
yeast
seems
to
be
the
dominant
characteristic
supplying
a
slightly
earthy
musty
complexity
with
some
sour
raisiny
fruitiness
a
decent
beer
but
not
as
fully
dimensional
as
anchors
classic
steam
beer
which
uses
the
yeast
to
better
effect
this
is
a
light
easy
sipper
that
will
quench
the
thirst
but
not
the
desire
for
adventure
pours
out
a
brilliant
golden
colour
pure
white
clumpy
frothy
head
lots
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
from
the
bottom
of
my
tall
glass
lightly
spiced
wheat
aroma
grainy
earthy
taste
is
a
big
letdown
any
real
wheat
flavour
is
drowned
out
by
an
overwhelmingly
spritzy
mouthfeel
i
want
to
taste
my
beer
not
feel
like
im
drinking
seltzer
water
a
hint
of
bittering
hops
make
up
the
finish
not
very
good
although
not
true
to
the
typical
american
wheat
style
in
terms
of
hoppiness
this
beer
is
really
good
pours
to
a
beautiful
white
foam
head
with
tiny
bubbles
and
bits
of
lace
clear
deep
yellow
colorobviously
fined
and
filtered
flavor
is
mostly
dry
tangy
and
hoppy
with
a
nice
malty
finish
with
slight
notes
of
fruit
and
butter
as
well
an
excellent
choice
for
summer
sessions
very
easy
drinking
if
you
like
bitter
beer
flavorwise
this
beer
has
more
in
common
with
german
pilsner
than
it
does
with
most
wheat
beers
if
you
enjoy
a
good
pils
you
may
appreciate
this
oddball
brew
12
ounce
bottle
served
at
42nd
st
oyster
bar
for
2
i
remember
when
they
used
to
just
have
anchor
wheat
i
guess
at
some
point
they
made
it
a
summer
seasonal
aroma
is
slightly
grainy
with
light
lemon
hints
very
mild
overall
first
sip
reveals
a
thin
brew
with
rather
prickly
carbonation
flavor
is
mild
but
some
wheat
twang
is
present
the
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
rather
devoid
of
any
bold
flavors
the
finish
leaves
me
wondering
where
the
taste
is
this
beer
poured
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
good
amount
of
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
has
a
nice
semisweet
wheat
nose
to
it
the
flavors
in
this
beer
seem
to
not
really
mesh
too
well
together
i
notice
the
wheat
malt
upfront
and
maybe
a
little
citrus
taste
in
the
background
but
then
that
really
fades
spicy
hops
are
in
the
finish
but
they
seem
almost
out
of
place
this
beer
isnt
too
smooth
and
not
really
exciting
either
nothing
to
write
home
about
nice
bright
clear
golden
color
with
a
light
slightly
foamy
head
not
much
aroma
just
clean
grain
and
a
whiff
of
yeast
nice
clean
taste
crisp
malt
with
a
light
hop
bite
nice
full
body
allows
the
flavor
to
linger
on
the
palate
wish
id
bought
more
than
a
single
body
of
this
one
its
a
great
session
beer
rather
indistinct
from
any
other
entrylevel
american
wheat
ale
this
beer
does
little
for
me
its
clean
and
cold
but
thats
about
it
i
would
pass
on
this
in
the
future
appearance
golden
slightly
hazed
nice
white
head
leaves
nice
even
lacing
down
my
glass
aroma
sharp
sweetness
with
a
citrus
tone
wow
its
not
a
wit
definitely
an
american
wheat
ale
taste
bready
slight
bitter
finish
not
a
smooth
wheat
beer
light
citrus
and
wheat
flavor
but
clean
mouthfeel
lighter
body
lacks
smooth
crispness
high
carbonation
drinkability
mediocre
wheat
ale
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
flavors
are
blend
leaves
me
wanting
more
flavor
a
whole
lot
more
im
guessing
this
is
probably
what
a
good
american
pilsener
was
before
prohibition
some
pale
malt
some
wheat
because
its
cheaper
and
whatever
hops
you
could
get
your
hands
on
still
i
paid
for
it
so
ill
drink
the
other
5
hopefully
itll
get
better
this
is
a
very
subpar
american
wheat
beer
the
smell
makes
me
think
of
a
sour
and
off
lager
that
didnt
detract
too
much
from
the
taste
though
theres
almost
a
hint
fruit
in
there
possibly
apricot
it
sits
well
in
the
mouth
and
definitely
goes
down
easily
when
poured
in
a
glass
the
color
was
of
a
light
golden
yellow
with
foam
that
disapates
in
a
couple
of
seconds
the
smell
was
very
shallow
i
could
pick
up
a
little
citrus
and
hops
but
not
a
really
aroma
that
gets
your
attention
the
taste
had
a
citrus
flavor
that
tasted
like
a
sour
lemon
that
sourness
was
not
really
unpleasant
but
sort
of
a
turn
off
i
personally
dont
like
a
citrussour
flavor
when
drinking
wheat
beer
but
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
after
doing
yard
work
yum
yum
great
stuff
for
a
warm
summer
day
this
is
beer
to
mow
by
i
could
drink
litres
im
enjoying
this
a
bright
bright
brew
i
need
to
buy
a
few
sixers
cant
imagine
a
better
session
brew
to
match
this
spring
weather
more
hopped
than
anticipated
i
didnt
really
smell
it
drier
than
most
wheat
beers
if
i
was
blindfolded
id
probably
predict
this
to
be
a
light
american
pale
ale
this
is
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
as
a
wheat
beer
theres
very
little
to
notice
notes
good
rendition
of
a
lackluster
style
poured
with
a
thick
rocky
white
head
a
straw
color
with
touch
of
hazyness
slight
hint
of
malt
in
the
aroma
and
maybe
a
hint
of
some
esteryfruity
notes
in
the
background
has
a
crisp
refreshing
taste
that
is
nice
balance
to
the
slighty
watery
body
the
co2
adds
and
enhances
the
refreshing
quality
of
the
ale
kinda
bummed
that
these
were
twistoff
bottles
though
since
i
like
the
look
of
anchors
bottles
for
my
homebrew
big
letdown
the
other
beers
from
anchor
ive
had
have
been
delicious
this
basically
taste
like
a
bland
but
well
made
lager
thin
grainy
watery
nothing
really
really
struck
a
chord
with
it
being
a
wheat
beer
either
is
this
what
all
american
wheats
are
like
the
closest
thing
to
cascade
summer
blonde
i
can
remember
having
only
this
is
a
bit
better
crystal
clear
golden
large
fluffy
white
head
that
diminishes
slowly
to
leave
good
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
light
some
slight
banana
mild
caramel
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
flavor
is
equally
light
mixing
the
above
together
in
a
wellbalanced
manner
mouthfeel
is
crisp
clean
somewhat
dry
ending
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
brew
but
not
terrible
while
not
a
horrible
beer
the
smell
is
not
its
strong
point
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
i
probably
wont
purchase
again
pat
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
very
nice
head
that
left
a
very
nice
lace
smell
was
weak
and
somewhat
fruity
taste
was
mild
with
a
slight
tartness
that
was
a
nice
touch
mouthfeel
was
light
but
somewhat
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
summer
offering
a
light
fruitiness
to
the
aroma
as
well
as
a
good
amount
of
floral
hop
bouquet
smells
lightly
wheaty
with
a
bit
of
grain
in
the
nose
deep
gold
color
like
a
czech
pils
brilliantly
clear
nice
clean
tasting
with
a
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
for
a
wheat
beer
accompanied
with
a
light
sweetness
that
finishes
the
beer
off
light
body
with
a
bit
of
maltiness
to
it
nice
and
refreshing
pours
out
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
thins
out
but
stays
till
the
end
and
leaves
a
lace
around
the
glass
each
time
you
take
a
sip
imo
there
really
isnt
much
to
this
brew
no
strong
charcteristics
smell
or
tastes
the
little
smell
that
i
could
pick
out
was
that
of
wheat
and
citrus
hops
taste
was
of
citrus
hops
a
bit
of
wheat
and
some
floral
hops
as
well
not
a
bad
brew
pours
to
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
chunky
white
head
that
looks
like
dish
soap
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
with
a
light
fruity
hoppiness
the
flavor
is
of
wheat
light
malt
and
spicy
fruity
hops
it
is
a
light
bodied
smooth
beer
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
very
refreshing
the
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brilliant
gold
body
with
a
light
orange
cast
and
a
full
head
of
creamy
bright
white
foam
quite
attractive
the
head
retention
is
fairly
good
and
although
it
eventually
drops
to
just
a
collar
it
does
leave
some
very
nice
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
delivers
a
distinctly
wheatlike
malt
with
some
hay
and
a
mild
backgroundnote
of
citrus
lemon
its
crisp
and
invigorating
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
fine
and
somewhat
effervescent
carbonation
that
delicately
prickles
the
tongue
and
then
dissappears
letting
the
beer
glide
smoothly
down
the
gullet
perfect
for
a
refreshing
summer
beer
the
flavor
reveals
much
more
lemony
character
than
the
nose
suggests
wrapped
in
a
blanket
of
soft
and
dry
wheatish
malt
a
firm
bitterness
rises
and
leads
into
a
dry
lingering
finish
where
the
citrus
receives
one
more
quick
turn
and
then
an
almost
metallic
bitterness
engulfs
the
mouth
a
light
bodied
dry
and
refreshing
american
wheat
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
and
the
beer
itself
is
very
smooth
and
light
and
although
i
dont
buy
into
the
idea
of
seaonal
beers
i
concede
this
is
probably
a
good
one
for
a
hot
day
especially
considering
the
flavors
only
emerge
to
any
degree
as
it
warms
a
good
deal
but
it
would
be
better
to
look
for
something
with
a
little
more
character
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
possesed
of
all
the
attributes
which
i
would
look
for
in
a
favorite
except
that
it
fails
to
deliver
the
most
crucial
part
of
the
experience
flavor
i
suppose
its
moderate
alcohol
make
it
readily
and
safely
consumable
in
larger
quantity
nothing
to
get
terribly
excited
about
in
this
offering
yet
it
seems
that
anchor
is
out
to
as
the
label
states
revive
not
only
hearty
dark
bers
but
light
crisp
in
style
modern
american
wheat
beers
as
well
im
not
sure
they
have
revived
a
style
or
if
the
style
modern
american
wheat
beer
is
actually
a
style
but
i
will
say
the
beer
refreshed
nicely
enough
and
was
certainly
light
and
crisp
it
also
had
the
tiniest
citrus
twang
at
the
tail
end
and
came
off
as
a
clean
well
made
example
of
what
they
intended
it
to
be
and
while
ive
read
the
reviews
saying
it
did
not
taste
like
a
german
hefe
and
that
it
was
not
worth
the
bother
i
must
say
that
while
i
love
german
wheat
beer
i
dont
think
this
is
pretending
to
be
one
further
id
bet
plenty
of
folk
would
enjoy
this
if
not
entirely
for
its
simplicity
more
than
a
hefe
a
decent
again
lawnmower
beer
i
believe
in
fact
has
its
place
in
american
culture
and
i
think
that
is
what
was
intended
here
i
think
it
is
at
the
very
least
worth
the
bother
a
pretty
bland
yet
drinkable
lightish
beer
from
anchor
light
gold
with
a
pure
white
creamy
head
little
or
no
aroma
smooth
bland
taste
but
goes
good
on
a
warm
day
a
quaffer
for
sure
but
below
anchors
standards
in
my
opinion
worth
being
a
lawnmower
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
tall
and
puffy
white
head
that
soon
fades
into
a
web
of
sticky
lace
nose
is
malted
wheat
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
is
quite
clean
light
and
crisp
in
body
and
texture
taste
starts
off
with
notes
of
wheat
and
acidic
lemony
citrus
followed
by
some
bitter
and
spicy
hops
that
lead
to
a
dry
finish
a
very
refreshing
brew
that
should
be
a
real
treat
once
the
heat
of
the
texas
summer
gets
more
intense
this
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
it
has
a
nose
with
hints
of
orange
and
tangerine
it
is
slightly
sweet
yet
finishes
cleaning
in
my
opinion
its
a
good
lawn
mower
beer
its
a
beer
like
this
which
allows
me
to
coerce
my
wife
into
going
out
for
a
pint
she
liked
it
a
good
looking
beer
crystal
clear
amber
with
a
nice
head
on
top
but
from
there
on
out
i
will
be
disappointed
the
first
hint
was
that
the
aroma
did
not
smell
like
a
wheat
beer
or
summery
beer
i
smelled
a
faint
malty
odor
mixed
among
the
biscuity
undertones
the
beer
is
weak
in
flavor
almost
unfresh
or
sour
reminiscent
of
a
macro
there
is
a
hint
of
lemon
for
the
summer
i
guess
not
an
impressive
beer
from
an
impressive
brewery
translucent
golden
hue
oodles
of
animation
excellent
clarity
served
with
a
healthy
and
long
lasting
inch
white
head
loads
of
lace
light
citrusy
nose
with
hints
of
floral
hops
and
a
note
of
wheat
the
bouquet
is
rather
faint
decent
and
refreshing
palate
slightly
toasty
malt
infused
with
citrus
notes
and
flowery
hops
simple
yet
enjoyable
mediumlight

minimal

this
is
very
much
a
summertime
thirst
quencher
session
brew
overall
good
stuff
light
gold
color
large
foamy
head
with
a
light
fruity
aroma
a
medium
bodied
wheat
beer
light
and
refreshing
does
not
have
the
banana
and
clove
taste
of
most
wheat
beers
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
this
beer
poured
a
crystal
clear
bright
yellow
with
a
heathy
white
head
the
head
lingered
for
a
long
time
and
left
a
delightful
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
of
malt
was
nice
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
was
the
biggest
disappointment
there
was
a
sour
finish
that
killed
the
malt
and
hop
combination
the
first
couple
sips
i
thought
was
great
but
soon
the
sour
aftertaste
lingered
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
the
carbonation
tingled
my
tongue
the
sourness
spoiled
an
otherwise
great
beer
there
is
really
not
a
lot
to
this
one
the
flavor
was
lacking
it
was
very
weak
it
was
crisp
and
grainy
with
a
few
notes
of
citrus
although
it
was
fairly
boring
it
was
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
a
great
drinker
and
it
could
make
a
great
keg
beer
for
a
barbeque
just
dont
expect
it
to
get
interesting
i
warmed
up
to
it
after
a
few
but
it
was
still
just
good
clear
dark
gold
with
a
glistening
14
inch
head
of
a
very
white
color
thick
ring
laces
in
the
glass
peppery
aroma
slight
qualities
of
air
freshener
the
main
initial
impression
is
a
leathery
malt
slightly
sugary
but
leatherlike
quickly
balanced
mid
mouth
by
lemony
and
husky
wheat
tones
and
what
appears
to
be
decisive
hop
overtones
crisp
and
very
tightly
balanced
beer
however
i
just
dont
like
the
flavor
profile
in
general
acidic
aftertaste
interesting
ill
try
another
when
the
real
summer
heat
sets
in
a
decent
beer
it
is
pale
yellow
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
very
refreshing
with
tastes
of
grainy
mailt
and
dry
and
hoppy
finish
it
has
a
nice
wheat
smothness
to
it
not
much
to
dig
into
here
but
a
good
summer
beer
non
the
less
could
drink
this
one
all
day
at
a
barbacue
not
a
bad
beer
from
anchor
in
the
style
of
an
american
summer
wheat
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
a
white
head
which
had
some
very
nice
lace
around
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
reminded
somewhat
of
dogfood
it
was
a
little
too
biscuity
for
me
and
not
balanced
enough
the
taste
was
firm
and
crisp
with
a
refreshing
aftertaste
easily
a
good
summer
beer
to
drink
not
sip
drinkabilitynotes
not
as
complex
as
i
had
expected
although
good
by
any
measure
this
beer
seems
mediocre
compared
to
the
other
anchor
products
still
it
is
quite
refreshing
very
nice
lightflavored
wheat
beer
an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
summer
offering
typically
im
not
a
fan
of
weiss
beers
but
the
lightness
of
flavor
in
this
one
minus
the
weiss
yeast
that
provides
the
annoying
banana
and
clove
characteristics
which
are
usually
found
in
most
yeasty
weiss
beers
made
this
one
enjoyable
for
me
a
large
whipped
egg
white
head
sits
atop
this
pale
yellow
brew
it
is
just
oh
so
slightly
cloudy
and
the
head
stays
for
a
while
and
comes
back
with
a
shakin
a
weak
aroma
of
wheat
is
there
and
thats
about
it
for
nosing
it
watery
mouthfeel
dissappoints
right
away
i
mean
it
should
be
a
little
bit
watery
hence
the
style
but
this
was
just
too
thin
for
my
preferences
its
oh
so
too
bland
a
smidgeon
of
wheat
flavor
in
the
finish
is
about
all
there
is
to
enjoy
in
the
flavor
department
i
must
say
its
better
than
a
pale
lager
from
the
big
3
so
theres
a
plus
theres
a
certain
refreshing
quality
to
it
i
might
prefer
a
beer
such
as
this
when
its
95
degrees
outside
but
it
wont
be
for
anything
more
than
a
refreshing
fluid
that
happens
to
be
a
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
composed
of
large
bubbles
the
head
diminishes
slowly
with
a
puffy
cloudlike
appearance
not
a
bad
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
very
mild
like
the
aroma
the
flavor
and
feel
are
also
light
and
mild
goes
down
smooth
a
very
drinkable
beer
on
a
summer
day
poured
nicely
with
a
clear
golden
color
with
huge
rocky
headvery
faint
lemony
smell
but
not
much
in
the
nose
kinda
citruisy
on
the
palate
with
some
faint
smokiness
in
therereally
easy
to
drink
perfect
for
summer
i
probably
would
by
this
again
on
a
warm
summer
day
on
the
pour
a
translucent
golden
color
the
head
prodigious
in
size
frothy
bright
white
and
as
it
desiccates
the
lace
left
behind
forms
a
fine
covering
sheet
upon
the
glass
malt
dominates
the
nose
sweet
citrus
crisp
and
clean
with
the
start
somewhat
sweet
and
top
is
skeletal
finish
has
a
spicy
yet
mild
hop
presence
acidity
moderate
and
the
aftertaste
dry
a
good
session
beer
any
time
of
the
year
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
a
nice
pilsner
like
color
not
the
cloudy
style
of
the
last
couple
wheat
beers
ive
had
it
is
definately
smooth
going
down
i
was
thinking
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
at
the
side
of
a
camp
fire
on
a
nice
hot
night
worth
trying
it
poured
with
an
abundant
head
which
left
lacing
as
the
glass
was
emptied
all
to
my
liking
the
light
gold
color
was
surprisingly
clear
considering
the
wheat
content
the
wheat
was
definately
present
in
the
aroma
though
this
was
the
pure
smell
of
toasted
wheat
without
any
fruit
esters
i
presume
this
is
a
result
of
the
use
of
an
ale
yeast
the
taste
was
clean
and
reserved
though
intricate
characterized
most
strongly
by
the
toastiness
of
the
wheat
only
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
was
necessary
to
round
out
the
flavor
the
total
package
was
light
and
refeshing
without
being
in
the
least
boring
exceptionally
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
imbibing
this
brew
on
a
hot
midsummer
weekend
pleasant
but
light
aroma
with
a
flowery
mix
of
pale
and
wheat
malts
that
was
also
sweet
at
times
big
full
white
head
like
whipped
egg
whites
as
advertised
light
overall
flavor
but
refreshing
impressively
low
amount
of
wheat
flavor
considering
its
over
65
wheat
malt
fairly
soft
mouthfeel
and
well
balanced
carbonation
nice
thirst
quenching
qualities
for
an
ale
this
could
do
very
nicely
in
the
summer
just
a
little
low
for
wheat
flavor
but
a
good
summer
ale
it
did
get
a
little
too
bitter
as
it
warmed
pours
a
very
clear
gold
slightly
cloudy
small
but
very
thick
head
good
lace
throughout
initial
smell
of
yeast
perhaps
of
baked
bread
noticed
up
front
is
the
taste
of
malted
yeast
just
like
the
label
states
with
a
follow
of
sourcitrus
taste
and
a
tiny
feel
of
hops
left
on
the
palate
has
a
bitter
dry
feel
towards
the
middle
pretty
tasty
and
this
sampled
in
the
middle
of
winter
ultimately
a
dissappointment
dark
golden
color
with
a
medium
thick
slightly
offwhite
head
strong
floral
aroma
with
a
faint
spice
presence
wheaty
citrusy
flavor
up
front
that
tapered
somewhat
by
the
end
slightly
dry
bitter
finish
not
as
bland
as
a
lot
of
summer
ales
but
still
kind
of
lackluster
pours
an
ultraclear
very
different
pale
yellowbrown
if
that
makes
sense
has
a
very
large
pillowy
head
that
has
a
tightbubbled
density
with
staying
power
the
smell
is
grassy
and
slightly
wheaty
and
mild
hops
it
a
crisp
and
clean
initial
taste
that
consists
of
very
light
wheat
and
a
breadlike
taste
and
hop
bite
that
starts
in
the
middle
and
carries
to
the
end
very
complex
for
a
beer
this
clear
imo
yet
it
is
very
well
balanced
it
has
a
unique
mouthfeel
that
is
malty
during
but
finishes
very
thin
and
slightly
dry
kinda
odd
but
overall
a
pretty
good
brew
it
wasnt
hot
when
i
tried
this
so
maybe
thats
what
was
missing
enjoyed
it
nonetheless
cheers
musty
earthy
wheat
nose
clear
gold
color
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
creamy
white
head
smooth
soft
musty
malt
taste
it
lacks
any
real
complexity
it
is
not
bad
just
dissapointing
no
real
hop
or
yeast
character
the
label
says
that
and
i
quote
the
head
on
this
beer
is
unusually
abundant
with
a
consistency
similar
to
egg
whites
theyre
not
kidding
a
massive
head
on
pour
making
it
difficult
for
me
to
get
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
on
my
first
attempt
the
head
eventually
settled
to
a
steady
14
but
only
after
leaving
the
glass
with
a
beautiful
lace
an
unusual
summer
beer
wheat
beer
very
golden
in
color
the
nose
was
very
feint
on
my
bottle
as
was
the
taste
clean
and
light
tasting
just
too
light
not
much
mouthfeel
and
a
weak
barely
detectable
shortlived
bitterness
a
good
thirst
quencher
and
a
different
type
of
summer
beer
or
an
alternative
wheat
beer
however
you
view
this
beer
its
not
mainstream
thats
for
sure
its
not
that
its
bad
it
is
a
reasonable
beer
but
it
has
an
identity
crisis
to
me
summer
beers
are
hoppier
and
wheat
beers
are
far
more
sturdy
with
citric
tones
this
is
neither
yet
purports
to
be
both
i
just
expected
more
taste
from
this
beer
its
a
bit
wimpy
for
a
summer
beer
for
me
a
dissappointment
coming
from
anchor
golden
yellow
body
with
steady
carbonation
topped
by
a
big
frothy
white
bubbly
head
great
lacing
wheat
malt
in
the
nose
but
not
much
else
maybe
a
hint
of
spiciness
a
tad
of
lemon
in
the
taste
everything
is
extremely
muted
not
an
interesting
beer
and
in
the
future
i
would
stay
with
the
steam
or
liberty
ale
which
are
both
fine
beers
for
the
summertime
clear
golden
with
a
huge
white
frothy
head
nose
is
of
malted
wheat
taste
is
more
reminescent
of
a
pilsener
to
me
very
dry
finish
tart
lemon
like
bite
really
nothing
outstanding
sticks
out
maybe
just
not
my
style
of
wheat
but
really
the
best
things
i
can
say
about
it
is
its
clean
and
crisp
anchor
summer
light
bodies
hazy
golden
color
wheatlight
citrus
aroma
very
thin
bodied
with
minor
citrus
notes
almost
absent
is
weissbanana
taste
that
makes
a
good
summer
beer
not
worth
the
bother
this
beer
poured
a
light
golden
color
and
formed
a
nice
light
foamy
very
white
head
that
faded
quickly
but
left
some
nice
lace
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
lemon
and
lightly
of
hops
the
flavor
was
of
hops
and
citrus
the
finish
was
light
and
a
bit
tangy
not
as
good
as
anchors
other
offerings
but
alright
summer
session
brew
this
clear
golden
brew
throws
out
a
hefty
meringuelike
head
carbonation
is
very
evident
by
the
rapidly
rising
gaseous
bubbles
theres
a
nice
malted
wheat
aroma
mixed
in
with
some
subtle
notes
of
spicy
hops
the
taste
of
this
is
pretty
big
on
the
wheat
characteristics
it
also
contains
nice
spicy
hop
accents
a
lemon
tang
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
a
nice
change
from
all
of
the
hefeweizens
out
there
these
days
everything
about
this
beer
seemed
muted
except
for
the
carbonation
there
were
hints
of
wheat
some
mild
sweetness
and
not
much
in
the
suspended
yeast
department
if
this
were
a
beer
by
most
brewers
i
would
think
it
was
pretty
solid
for
what
it
is
but
i
was
pretty
dissappointed
with
this
coming
from
anchor
especially
at
7
50
a
six
pack
if
the
plan
is
to
dumb
down
a
beer
they
should
dumbdown
the
price
too
i
do
have
to
say
as
far
as
bottles
go
it
was
a
goodlooking
bottle
big
22
oz
bottle
pours
clear
straw

lots
of

fizzy

big
grainy

very
acidic
not
much
florals
very
faint

taste
was
faintly
yeast
mostly
grainy
and
oddly
acidic
the
lemon
wedge
helps
this
wheat
beer
into
some
flavor
very
thin
finish
nothing
more
than
average
which
is
a
dissapointment
from
anchor
a
damn
near
perfect
summerspring
beer
crisp
clean
refreshing
and
delicious
tart
but
not
too
much
so
fading
quickly
into
a
wheaty
beer
without
the
unpleasant
flowery
taste
of
a
european
wheat
beer
smells
kinda
fishy
though
scent
is
somewhat
unpleasant
but
not
so
bad
as
to
ruin
or
really
even
significantly
harm
the
beer
a
small
bit
of
lemon
comes
through
as
well
pours
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
sweet
fruity
and
wheat
smell
taste
is
delicious
has
just
enough
of
a
spice
to
it
very
well
balanced

too
great

dont
drink
just
one
of
them

my

i
would
love
it
year

not
my
style

solid
wheat
beer
i
felt
the
buttering
hops
worked
well
with
the

taste
great
beer
always
look
forward
to
it
coming
out
every
year
everyone
says
it
gets
worse
every
year
i

for
2015
not
a
real
fan
of
wheat
beer
but
this
is
the
best
ive
tasted
crisp
summer
beer
great
on
tap
this
is
my
favorite
beer
and
i
always
look
forward
to
its
release
every
summer
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
drink
while
sitting
around
a
campfire
or
after
a
long
day
of
work
while
you
bar
b
que
some
steaks
or
burgers
one
of
my
favorite
wheats
although
it
looked
and
smelled
pleasant
enough
this
one
tasted
like
suntan

very
very
unpleasant
its

here
in

michigan
and
im
drinking
this
mostly
average
but
extremely
satisfying
summer
ale
very
hoppy
and
the
wheat
is
definitely
in
the
aroma

one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
the
only
thing
bad
about
oberon
is
that
its
seasonal
has
a
nice
crisp
after
taste
a
perfect
craft
beer
not
particularly
noteworthy
but

one
of
the
best

beer
not
much
going
for
it
other
than
that
great
summertime
beer
this
beer
occupies
the
category
of
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
perhaps
defines
it
it
pours
a
little
darker
and
more
golden
than
many
of
the
belgian
witbieren
but
it
pours
cloudy
with
a
nice
creamy
head
yeasty
bread
and
citrus
aromas
preface
rich
malt
flavors
a
little
more
than
with
some
witbieren
but
it
works
it
may
also
have
a
touch
more
hop
than
some
witbieren
but
they
are
nicely
balanced
by
the
malt
and
alcohol
if
bells
have
added
any
spices
they
have
not
added
much
here
the
spiciness
comes
from
the
yeast
and
the
hops

nothing

but
a

drinkable
beer
it
reminds
me
of
the
early
days
of
micros
when
everyone
made
a
generic
american
wheat
this
offering
is
slightly
tastier
than
the
average
wheat
beer
but
it
is
certainly
nothing
special
ooverall
a
refreshing
beer
but
no
outstanding
qualities
about
it
o
i
was
glad
to
get
this
on
a
trip
to
virginia
wanted
something
not
distributed
to
maine
but
easy
drinking
and
the
wife
might
like
this
was
spot
on
nice
crisp
pilsner
esque
flavor
profile
thats
a
little
maltier
with
a
meaty
body
from
the
wheat
departure
from
the
bombardment
of
fruity
wheat
beers
common
in
these
parts
in
summer
not
knocking
my
socks
off
by
any
means
but
a
solid
brew
nonetheless
straightforward
american
wheat
ale
with
an
enjoyable
hop
presence
that
leaves
the
yeasty
wheat
flavor
intact
a
good
summer
brew
but
climbs
up
a
bit
in
abv
compared
to
many
others
in
the
same
style
not
out
of
place
though
o
super
drinkable
and
a
great
fit

something

an
a
bells
oberon
ale
is
one
of
the
finest
americanstyle
wheat
beers
ive
ever
had
combining
the
hearty
wheat
malt
backbone
of
a
quality
german
hefe
the
citrusy
hop
notes
of
an
american
ipa
and
the
light
crisp
refreshing
nature
one
should
expect
from
this
frequently
mundane
style
a
great
beer
that
comes
highly
recommended
id
be
buying
this
regularly
if
it
were
available
on
this
side
of
the
border
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
foamy
off
white
head
that
provides
good
coverage
throughout
drinking
and
gives
a
decent
lace
the
nose
is
wheatmalt
sweetness
upfront
no
bubblegum
followed
by
a
subtle
citrus
character
from
the
hops
and
has
an
almost
negligible
yeast
presence
the
taste
is
offputting
when
fridgecold
but
has
cracked
wheat
sweetness
and
balanced
hops
as
it
enters
that
4050
degree
sweet
spot
its
a
relatively
lightbodied
ale
with
foamy
almost
chewy
proteincarbonation
modest
and
balanced

presence
minimal
lingering
bitterness
and
undetectable
alcohol
though
i
still
prefer
the
two
hearted
cans
this
beer
is
affordableavailable
and
perfect
for
that
outdoorsey
can
crushing
itch
overall
this
beer
appears
to
have
potential
but
no
taste
or
smell
really
stands
out
it
is
smooth
and
drinkable
but
i
have
the
feeling
this
could
be
so
much
better
overall
a
good
summer
beer
that
is
worth
a
go
every
year
operhaps
my
can
was
old
but
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
something
quenchable
but
with
a
bit
more
substance
than
a
typical
wheat
beer
oberon
however
just
felt
watered
down
and
hastily
assembled
it
isnt
terrible
but
i
dont
need
to
drink
it
again
its
closing
taste
is
smooth
creamydry
and
with
an
herbal
bitterness
similar
to
sassafras
and
soft
white
pepper
sweetness
continues
to
dissolve
and
exposes
the
elements
of
grain
leaf
mint
clove
and
even
vanilla
o
a
very
nice
pale
wheat
here
from
bells
and
the
16
oz
can
format
makes
it
even
better
overall
this
is
an
above
average
wheat
ale
definitely
on
the
buy
again
list
this
is
classified
as
a
pale
wheat
ale
on
ba
what
i
had
was
unlike
any
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
i
last
had
it
in
2006
and
i
guess
ill
wait
another
eight
years
before
i
try
it
again
nice

this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
o
this
bottle
was
2
months
old
but
thats
not
bad
i
dont
know
but
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
i
wouldnt
cringe
if
offered
one
but
i
would
ask
what
else
was
is
available

oberon
ale
is
an
unfiltered

the
smell
is
rich
with
wheat
and
grains
so
far
so
good
the
taste
is
bold
with
wheat
and
grains
there
is
not
a
lot
of
citrus
in
this
brew
for
being
a
wheat
brew
this
has
very
little
citrus
in
it
the
taste
is
nice
and
clean
this
is
a
well
balanced
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
clean
and
smooth
there
is
no
bad
aftertaste
to
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
25
out
of
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
overall
not
a
bad
pale
wheat
could
have
used
more
hops
andor
spice
but
still
a
decent
one
definitely
worth
picking
up
a
sixpack
on
your
way
to
a
bbq
oberon
is
tasty
easy
drinking
thirst
quenching
the
fruitiness
makes

i
think
ive
found
the
wheat
brew
meant
for
me
i
will
cry
like
a
toddler
after
this
goes
away
after
this
season
maybe
its
because
wheat
beers
do
nothing
for
me
at
any
time
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
could
be
some
michigan
pride
now
that
i

overall
this
is
one
of
those

i
buy
consistently

reminds

is
a

down

was
making

i
got
the
residue
out
the

by
pouring

of
the
brew
into
my
glass
then
swirling
the
rest
around
the

until

loosened
up
then
pour
the

in

got
to
get
all
that
flavor
in
my

smiling
ma
new
summer
brew
a
reasonably
interesting
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
a
little
bit
juicy
much
more
dry
and
sour
overall
i
seem
to
recall
being
more
impressed
with
a
minikeg
version
of
this
beer
that
i
brought
back
from
a
trip
to
michigan
a
few
years
back
still
a
fair
enough
beer
that
ill
go
back
to
the
next
time
i
come
across
some
makes
for
a
nice
warmweather
thirst
quencher
o
this
beer
reminds
me
of
summer
easy
drinking
and
good
flavor
it
has
a
nice
taste
that
i
found
i
grew
to
like
more
as
i
drink
more
of
it
it
has
a
very
good
wheatyhoppy
taste
with
a
good
amount
of
kick
to
it
the
sweet
aftertaste
left
in
my
mouth
was
also
very
enjoyable
a
decent
session
ale
for
warmer
weather
great
for
drinking
while
you
are
outside
grilling
up
some
love
love
the
4
pack
16
ounce
cans
for
6
99
definitely
a
bargain
been
waiting
for
awhile
to
try
this
and
since
bells
finally
made
it
down
to
san
diego
i
got
my
chance
the
wheat
is
featured
front
and
center
with
enough
going
on
to
keep
it
interesting
and
relevant
in
the
craft
revolution
of
over
hopped
everything
oberon
is
gonna
fit
right
in
fine
for
the
ever
sunny
days
around
here
poured
a
hazy
straw
gold
with
a
thick
cap
of
creamy
white
head
head
has
great
retention
and
leaves
nice
lacing
throughout
the
beer
the
aroma
is
light
with
hints
of
fruit
the
taste
is
also
mild
but
a
bit
more
robust
with
some
nice
esters
a
little
bit
of
bread
and
a
slight
earthy
quality
to
it
it
has
a
good
light
weight
to
the
body
and
its
not
fizzy
despite
the
volumes
of
carbonation
a
nice
take
on
the
traditional
wheat
easy
drinking
and
with
a
good
flavor
o
it
is
summertime
here
in
nc
and
this
hit
the
spot
after
some
yard
work
when
the
weather
gets
hot
i
tend
to
like
lagers
wheat
and
wits
this
is
really
one
of
the
better
ones
look
for
it
in
bells
new
16
ounce
cans
o
i
guess
that
im
not
a
fan
of
this
style
so
i
will
be
objective
because
i
cant
get
too
excited
about
this
beer
i
like
the
aroma
of
banana
and
clove
and
a
chewy
wheat
beer
this
is
not
that
kind
of
beer
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
too
much
of
and
i
will
not
buy
it
again
the
pull
downs
keep
me
honest
weighted
avg
for
the
important
stuff
overall
a
good
goto
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
beer
drinks
with
a
medium
to
light
body
with
high
drinkability
but
a
huge
lack
of
flavor
o
an
excellent
summer
beer
m
peppy
carbonated
fresh
and
crisp
perfect
for
a
summer
day
smell
was
too
subtle
to
rate
in
this
environment
great
summertime
must
try
i
wish
this
came
in
cans
good
boat
beer
drinkability
perfect
for
a
warm
sunny
day
there
isnt
many
more
refreshing
beers
for
the
summer
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
as
it
is
quite
drinkable
for
those
outside
of
michigan
who
have
never
tried
it
i
highly
recommend
it
overall
oberon
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
recommend
it
on
a
hot
summer
day
oberon
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
especially
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
as
the
temperatures
begin
to
rise
and
i
can
enjoy
it
outdoors
as
advised
i
requested
this
beer
without
the
orange
to
really
get
a
feel
for
the
taste
of
the
recipe
i
could
definitely
taste
the
fruity
notes
in
the
beer
and
it
made
for
a
very
smooth
and
crisp
taste
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
very
refreshing
overall
a
great
summer
beer
this
one
is
a
refreshing
crowd
pleaser
that
would
be
a
surefire
success
with
large
crowds
of
both
craft
and
noncraft
drinkers
at
summer
bbqs
this
is
one
beer
i
can
categorically
say
i
would
seek
out
for
long
drinking
sessions
on
my
porch
reading
a
book
or
having
a
fire
in
the
patio
fire
pit
a
great
pale
wheat
ale
and
my
gold
standard
for
the
style
a
light
golden
color
slight
head
and
slightly
cloudy
smells
light
wheaty
and
citrusy
definitely
can
smell
slight
orange
notes
can
taste
that
as
well
very
enjoyable
taste
tastes
like
summer
crisp
clean
finish
definitely
one
of
my
go
to
beers
oberon
is
a
seasonal
beer
and
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
it
tastes
so
good
and
is
on
my
top
list
of
my
favorite
beers
i
added
an
orange
to
the
beer
after
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
it
was
delicious
i
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
likes
a
lighter
beer
and
a
beer
that
is
not
super
dark
i
am
a
fan
of
lighter
beer
i
initially
thought
this
beer
was
supposed
to
be
of
a
very
strong
orange
flavor
because
of
the
picture
and
how
people
always
put
oranges
in
it
but
now
i
know
it
is
a
very
nice
wheat
ale
with
a
citrus
yeast
to
add
that
flavor
also
larry
bells
intentions
were
to
never
have
orange
slices
in
this
beer
very
light
beer
with
good
flavor
for
a
nice
summer
day
overall
a
great
summer
offering
i
had
this
on
draft
and
in
bottle
and
the
quality
was
near
back
to
back
easy
drinking
on
a
warm
day
this
is
one
of
the
crafts
beers
id
recommend
on
a
90
degree
day
where
an
ipa
would
not
be
quenching
enough
not
as
wheaty
as
some
others
of
this
style
which
is
good
id
be
a
repeat
buyer
for
sure
o
definitely
embodies
summer
in
a
creative
way
doesnt
go
for
onedimensional
citrus
fruits
or
hops
but
rather
incorporates
a
bit
of
citrus
with
organic
summer
notes
really
enjoyed
it
ill
probably
be
drinking
it
through
the
season
ontap
at
bernies
taproom
in
waukesha
wi
pours
a
cloudy
golden
amber
color
with
a
slight
white
head
slight
citrus
aroma
the
texture
is
smooth
light
and
tasty
perfect
in
every
way
and
very
easy
to
see
why
it
is
considered
so
good
too
bad
they
dont
make
this
one
yearround
overall
it
is
my
favorite
summer
beer
yellow
golden
color
with
a
nice
citrus
aroma
strong
scent
of
orange
and
lemon
flavor
brings
out
a
feel
of
summer
with
its
hints
of
orange
and
citrus
sediments
linger
but
do
not
hinder
the
flavors
of
the
beer
very
good
seasonal
beer
especially
for
summer
has
a
pale
yellow
straw
color
with
slight
cloudyness
from
sediments
a
great
summer
beer
tastes
like
summer
light
and
refreshing
to
drink
when
its
hot
outside
yeasty
with
citrus
after
notes
cloudy
yellow
body
with
a
mildly
hoppy
aroma
the
beer
maintains
a
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
frothy
white
head
holds
the
body
of
the
beer
o
barring
a
couple
offerings
a
lot
of
this
brewerys
offerings
are
pretty
average
this
included
i
guess
im
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
standard
nonhefeweizen
nonhoppy
wheat
beers
on
the
other
hand
i
understand
why
this
is
popular
its
easy
going
and
very
drinkable
id
never
refuse
one
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
nice
hazy
yellowishgolden
color
left
an
interesting
settlement
in
the
bottle
had
about
1
finger
of
white
head
with
nice
lacing
not
a
strong
smell
hints
of
wheat
and
citrus
taste
is
sweet
with
a
detectable
honeyness
and
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
feels
smooth
and
refreshing
in
the
mouth
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
particularly
noteworthy
serving
style
bottle
o
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
those
warm
days
nothing
immaculate
but
i
would
definitely
recommend
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonals
and
one
i
will
keep
coming
back
to
this
ale
embodies
summer
in
every
facet
the
pour
is
a
hazy
pale
golden
hue
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
film
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
a
refreshing
blend
of
citrus
mostly
oranges
and
light
malts
and
subdued
hops
the
mouth
is
light
and
easy
definitely
something
you
could
knock
back
a
sixer
of
and
not
be
full
the
flavor
is
delicious
and
very
light
and
refreshing
there
is
a
very
natural
citrus
flavor
along
with
a
slight
malt
finish
it
is
actually
surprising
that
the
abv
is
as
high
as
it
is
given
how
smooth
and
light
this
drinks
definitely
a
beer
to
enjoy
sprawled
by
the
pool
or
on
the
beach
refreshing
is
the
best
i
can
say
overall
oberon
is
my
second
favorite
bells
beer
following
behind
their
two
hearted
sorry
larry
bell
i
prefer
a
nice
slice
of
orange
in
my
pint
with
it
as
well
cheers
o
enjoyable
warm
weather
beer
pours
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
softly
pastel
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
that
fell
fast
nose
is
golden
wheat
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
on
it
bright
lemon
zest
rounds
out
the
nose
taste
is
a
bit
maltier
than
i
expected
medium
light
rather
than
light
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
has
plenty
of
carbonation
to
keep
that
in
check
the
wheat
is
crisp
and
dry
the
middle
of
the
beer
is
juicy
with
sweet
lemon
peel
and
tart
lemon
too
there
is
a
bit
of
a
sour
taste
lurking
in
the
shadows
that
never
really
steps
out
but
it
gives
the
drink
a
slight
pucker
the
middle
of
the
beer
is
juicy
with
fruit
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
drying
finish
great
beer
not
as
strong
as
i
remember
but
i
still
enjoy
it
it
came
out
on
march
23
and
i
just
bought
it
for
the
first
and
definitely
not
the
the
last
time
of
the
season
i
believe
this
is
the
best
beer
bells
makes
in
my
opinion
the
mini
keg
does
taste
a
little
better
than
the
bottle
wheats
are
not
my
first
choice
but
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
been
waiting
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
glad
i
was
able
to
i
like
the
way
it
tasted
a
lot
and
beer
advocate
wont
let
me
post
my
outlier
review
without
a
comment
fairly
nondescript
really
almost
seems
to
leave
a
watery
impression
surprised
theres
not
more
hop
character
overall
decent
brew
but
i
will
only
drink
when
nothing
better
is
around
a
great
wheat
beer
that
i
drink
every
year
get
atleast
a
couple
6ers
overall
in
terms
of
wheat
beers
this
is
a
very
solid
choice
i
had
this
beer
a
few
years
ago
at
a
cool
little
cafe
in
ohiopyle
after
a
day
of
rafting
andor
hiking
it
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
it
is
refreshing
and
light
but
with
subtle
hoppiness
that
lets
you
know
its
a
bells
beer
thats
all
i
remember
about
this
brew
but
will
revisit
it
this
summer
i
like
pretty
much
all
bells
beers
o
as
far
as
summer
brews
go
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
bells
oberon
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
it
is
extremely
light
in
appearance
and
gives
off
a
distinctly
tangy
and
citrusy
smell
hops
and
orange
peel
definitely
jump
out
the
mouthfeel
can
be
a
bit
thin
but
the
taste
is
unmatched
if
you
prefer
pale
wheat
beers
a
great
beer
for
summer
however
this
beer
isnt
a
beer
a
beer
that
can
be
drank
all
year
round
but
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
it
is
perfect
the
taste
kinda
gets
old
after
4
beers
so
i
limit
myself
to
a
six
pack
overall
a
good
beer
and
i
look
forward
every
baseball
season
to
drinking
some
of
this
beer
bottom
line
try
this
it
is
incredibly
refreshing
in
the
summer
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
and
all
beer
drinkers
cheers
i
have
heard
some
rave
about
this
in
the
past
as
a
springsummer
beer
and
now
i
know
why
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
some
warm
days
its
refreshing
with
some
complexity
and
great
representative
of
the
american
pale

oberon
was
a
fruity
surprise
but
watery
to
the
mouth
it
had
that
runofthemill
beer
look
although
it
had
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
there
are
distinct
scents
of
oranges
or
maybe
even
tangerines
that
you
can
taste
distantly
from
the
hops
it
was
light
and
refreshing
if
not
bold
and
filling
a
decent
beer
one
that
you
want
to
try
if
you
had
enough
of
the
darker
variety
for
a
while
ov
its
a
decent
pale
wheat
ale
but
i
doubt
id
buy
this
again
when
i
can
get
lagunitas
sumpin
sumpin
i
know
different
takes
on
a
pwa
apples
to
oranges
but
this
is
somewhat
mundane
to
me
o
having
tasted
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
from
europe
and
the
u
s
it
is
sometimes
frustrating
to
have
a
beer
that
doesnt
live
up
to
the
standards
of
a
beer
that
can
be
had
in
nearly
every
bar
even
with
the
differences
between
the
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
something
like
a
hefeweizen
there
is
a
certain
punch
and
craftsmanship
that
you
look
for
that
is
common
in
both
styles
i
dont
feel
that
this
beer
meets
that
standard
i
know
people
who
enjoy
this
beer
and
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
i
seem
to
be
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fence
all
i
can
judge
is
the
sample
that
i
have
which
was
bottled
at
the
end
of
april
given
the
chance
i
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
and
on
tap
for
a
rereview
o
a
nice
summer
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
othe
spicy
bitter
hops
overwhelm
this
pale
wheat
beer
not
as
quenchable
as
a
less
bitter
wheat
beer
that
i
crave
in
the
summer
a
nice
zest
summer
wheat
light
and
refreshing
the
wheat
has
a
nice
profile
on
the
body
but
its
flavour
is
a
bit
in
the
backdrop
to
the
citrus
still
the
flavour
compliment
is
quite
nice
and
a
tasty
combination
more
hop
forward
than
wheat
o
this
wheat
ale
has
a
beautiful
bright
appearance
and
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
that
pairs
well
with
warm
weather
high
drinkability
would
have
a
few
in
a
row
not
my
favorite
bells
beer
but
pretty
good
for
a
wheat
beer
would
recommend
for
those
that
want
a
lighter
ale
thats
not
hoppy
overall
a
refreshing
summer
beer
that
i
would
have
again
but
would
not
necessarily
seek
out
overall
disappointing
not
bad
but
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
wasnt
my
favorite
bells
product
i
recommend
did
not
care
for
the
ammonia
in
the
nose
o
overall
the
hops
are
juicy
pulpy
with
a
refreshing
tart
lemonade
quality
perfect
for
sipping
poolside
on
a
hot
summer
day
refreshing
tart
not
overly
bitter
easy
consuming
nature
good
not
to
compare
apples
to
oranges
but
after
hearing
alot
about
this
is
not
on
the
same
level
as
thier
two
hearted
but
then
again
not
many
beers
are
overall
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
i
feel
like
this
offering
from
bells
often
gets
too
much
flack
from
the
craft
beer
community
overall
decent
summer
wheat
beer
not
a
very
complicated
brew
with
the
base
flavors
coming
from
the
wheat
profile
sweet
malt
with
more
of
a
bitter
orange
taste
than
sweet
this
combination
makes
for
a
balanced
taste
and
light
hints
of
spice
coriander
not
a
bad
choice
but
not
my
first
choice
either
however
the
lingering
after
taste
is
actually
pretty
awesome
and
makes
you
want
more
o
not
bad
but
it
isnt
really
my
style
but
it
is
much
better
than
regular
apas
i
didnt
finish
it
but
i
could
see
me
finishing
it
if
someone
brought
it
some
place
i
made
beer
pancakes
with
the
rest
of
it
and
they
were
delicious
its
not
usually
my
style
and
i
probably
wont
make
a
special
point
of
seeking
it
out
but
if
i
see
it
on
tap
again
this
summer
i
will
certainly
order
another
refreshing
summer
ale
an
aboveaverage
pale
wheat
ale
overall
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
a
dependable
beer
and
is
of
course
readily
available
in
my
area
michigan
the
only
disappointment
is
that
the
flavor
profile
isnt
too
interesting
but
this
is
probably
due
mainly
to
the
style
of
this
beer
o
not
my
favorite
style
its
definitely
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
id
like
a
little
more
wheat
flavor
id
go
for
a
straight
hefe
or
belgian
pale
ale
instead
not
horrible
but
there
are
better
out
there
this
beer
has
a
nice
refreshing
taste
but
unfortunately
its
not
particularly
complex
the
head
was
a
little
lacking
but
that
may
be
because
the
beer
sat
a
bit
while
our
lovely
waitress
got
her
act
together
could
use
more
carbonation
and
classic
wheat
flavors
a
little
thin
and
not
as
cloudy
as
id
like
not
my
favorite
from
bells
and
yet
its
not
bad
just
not
real
memorable
o
it
was
interesting
and
definitely
not
bad
for
a
wheat
beer
id
drink
it
again
o
a
great
summer
drinker
nothing
to
amaze
but
its
well
built
and
is
a
good
step
up
for
those
who
havent
had
anything
more
intense
o
different
from
the
bottle
compared
to
the
mini
keg
this
is
closer
to
a
draft
taste
i
have
suspicions
that
bottled
it
is
bottleconditioned
and
the
mini
keg
is
force
carbonated
its
basically
less
earthy
and
tastes
lighter
the
second
day
drinking
this
there
was
little
carbonation
left
even
with
closing
the
tap
and
the
vent
so
i
would
recommend
pouring
all
of
it
as
quickly
as
possible
i
would
also
recommend
shaking
the
keg
gently
before
opening
to
disturb
the
sediment
overall
i
just
love
the
idea
of
a
mini
keg
and
i
had
a
lot
of
fun
drinking
this
with
a
little
help
from
my
friends
oquite
a
nice
summer
ale
served
very
cold
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
for
hanging
out
on
the
deck
on
a
warm
summer
night
o
pretty
standard
for
a
wheat
ale
i
still
dont
understand
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
this
beer
apparently
it
used
to
be
a
lot
better
or
is
better
at
the
source
either
way
every
bottle
ive
had
has
been
just
ok
stm
stays
on
the
sweet
side
through
the
profile
wheat
aroma
up
front
then
rolls
into
honey
sweetness
then
just
feels
and
tastes
like
a
load
of
wet
wheat
and
grain
in
your
mouth
not
crisp
or
clean
on
the
finish
with
lasting
sweetness
not
refreshing
like
a
summer
beer
should
be
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
overall
the
good
folks
at
bells
have
done
the
world
a
great
service
here
oberon
is
a
great
light
refreshing
summer
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
day
under
the
sun
or
a
rainy
day
wishing
the
sun
would
show
its
face
the
balance
of
zesty
citrus
with
the
sweet
and
mellow
wheat
malt
backbone
combine
to
make
a
beautiful
ale
poured
from
tap
into
pint
at
yardhouse
in
palm
beach
gardens
florida
golden
color
with
small
amount
of
head
i
actually
expected
more
head
and
a
hazier
looking
brew
nice
crisp
clean
bright
citrus
and
slightly
hoppy
aroma
taste
is
really
nice
subtle
citrus
hop
and
wheat
malts
really
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
really
a
great
summer
brew
kind
of
reminds
me
of
sumpin
sumpins
baby
brother
o
great
beer
to
have
with
a
meal
or
at
a
picnic
nothing
that
will
blow
you
away
but
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
to
enjoy
so
be
it
ill
keep
trying
o
the
sun
on
the
bottle
suggests
a
summer
drink
and
thats
what
this
is
definitely
above
average
the
flavor
does
not
dominate
so
much
as
refresh
should
prove
a
popular
thirst
quencher
with
the
beach
crowd
overall
a
very
drinkable
summer
beer
and
it
pair
well
with
all
the
good
summer
fare
to
be
had
tried
this
for
the
first
time
today
after
hearing
much
about
it
from
my
local
distributor
shangys
in
emmaus
pa
never
got
any
bad
advice
from
shangys
they
turned
me
on
to
sierra
nevada
celebration
ale
many
years
ago
and
i
look
forward
to
its
annual
release
just
before
thanksgiving
back
to
oberon
this
is
an
outstanding
summer
brew
perfect
with
spicy
food
or
just
to
sit
back
and
watch
a
ballgame
i
usually
spend
a
little
less
on
lighter
beers
but
went
for
the
extra
few
bucks
out
of
curiosity
and
the
5
star
rating
giving
by
shangys
glad
i
did
because
this
is
a
keeper
and
easily
worth
the
extra
few
bucks
to
step
up
from
my
usual
summer
brews
like
sierra
nevada
brooklyn
and
sam
adams
my
glass
is
just
about
empty
so
its
time
to
end
this
review
and
go
grab
another
to
watch
the
belmont
stakes
the
horse
im
betting
also
begins
with
an
o
hopefully
it
will
be
a
winner
like

this

a

session
beer
not
very
complex
but
tasty
nonetheless
and
very
refreshing
plus
good
retention
and
lacing
already
looks
better
than
i
remember
the
nose
has
a
subtle
citrus
with
a
mild
wheat
base
mild
but
appealing
and
inviting
the
flavor
starts
with
a
gentle
citrus
flavor
orange
and
lemon
and
then
is
amplified
by
the
mild
wheat
base
mildly
bitter
the
hops
provide
a
welcome
flavor
addition
with
citrus
flavors
that
meld
well
with
the
wheat
neither
is
overpowering
and
as
such
the
beer
is
well
balanced
medium
bodied
but
lighter
the
beer
is
well
carbonated

poured

it

a

color
and
you
immediately
smell
citrus
fruits
like

it
is
medium
bodied
and
as
i
drink
it
right
now
i
am
being
reminded
of
a

has
lots
of
orange
and
i
get
a
little
bit
of
a

but
with

more

its
got
a
good
pale

malt
build
with
wheaty
and
citrusy
flavors
but
if
you
can
access
this
beer
but
if
you
want
a
nice
wheat
ale
for
the
summer
this
is
it
this
pours
yellow
orange
with
one
finger
of
head
and
a
lot
of
sediment
i
smelled
yeast
and
malt
this
is
a
high
quality
wheat
beer
that
has
some
spice
to
it
oberon
is
a
wheat
beerpale
ale
hybrid
that
is
a
refreshing
take
on
the
wheat
beer
a
style
that
do
not
usually
prefer
i
tasted
very
subtle
spice
perhaps
clove
but
certainly
not
any
gross
coriander
or
banana
blue
moon
nonsense
the
medium
body
makes
it
drinkable
but
its
a
little
sweet
and
malty
i
would
stick
with
one
or
two
of
these
unlike
most
american
wheat
beers
this
one
isnt
overly
spiced
and
covered
up
with
large
amounts
of
coreander
its
very
drinkable
with
an
average
abv
which
is
good
for
barbecues
and
hanging
outdoors
i
believe
it
stands
out
on
its
own
and
is
really
what
an
american
wheat
beer
should
be
easy
summer
drinker
and
i
could
see
where
its
a
gateway
beer
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
and
hot
up
to
what
ive
heard
about
this
brewer
then
again
tough
to
get
much
out
of
this
style
so
maybe
they
get
kudos
just
for
trying
edit
and
no
im
not
throwing
an
orange
slice
in
the
bottle
if
it
needs
an
orange
or
a
lemon
package
it
with
one
d
makes
for
a
refrshing
easy
drinker
quaffer
while
it
doesnt
really
look
or
smell
that
great
it
tastes
fine
and
drinks
easy
its
definitely
on
the
thicker
side
for
the
style
but
it
works
drinkability
good
drinkability
perfect
for
warmer
days
of
summer
and
one
you
can
drink
slowly
and
enjoy
while
i
love
bells
brewery
and
the
vast
majority
of
their
offeringsand
i
adore
wheat
beersthis
just
simply
isnt
one
of
them
even
though
im
obviously
in
the
minority
in
that
opinion
judging
by
oberons
sales
d
total
session
beer
pretty
decent
full
bodied
flavor
without
being
a
palate
killer
could
easily
put
back
several
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
when
i
can
find
it
ill
grab
a
6
pack
or
so
would
probably
do
this
twice
per
season
an
amber
beer
that
smells
of
malts
and
hops
and
has
a
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
lacing
this
smells
pretty
wheaty
and
citrusy
also
it
is
crisp
and
tastes
like
a
slightly
heavier
than
normal
wheat
beer
with
more
flavor
and
more
hops
than
i
would
expect
i
would
drink
bottles
of
this
and
glad
i
can
find
it
at
a
lot
of
bars
d
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
think
it
is
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
time
i
like
this
beer
and
i
think
it
is
a
good
addition
to
the
bells
lineup
off
tap
at
grami
in
chicago
this
beer
was
served
to
me
with
an
orange
slice
the
color
was
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
two
fingers
of
rocky
yellowtinted
head
the
cap
retained
itself
beautifully
and
the
lacing
was
in
solid
bands
the
aroma
was
light
but
inviting
wheat
and
crystal
malt
the
flavors
were
similar
i
tasted
crystal
malts
wheat
a
little
sweetness
and
some
breadiness
which
gave
it
a
doughy
quality
and
a
slighty
bitter
finish
when
the
touch
of
hops
came
through
rather
light
and
subtle
yet
possessing
finesse
for
this
reason
coupled
with
the
light
bodycarbonation
would
make
it
a
great
session
beer
ontap
is
so
much
better
than
the
bottle
makes
a
world
of
difference
but
both
are
great
one
of
my
favorite
beers
im
not
incredibly
impressed
by
this
maybe
an
orange
wedge
could
tune
it
up
but
im
not
into
all
that
d
drinkable
crisp
good
for
summertime
in
other
words
a
wheat
beer
decent
overall
but
not
something
i
reach
for
often
ive
had
this
a
few
times
its
an
unfiltered
beer
meaning
sometimes
youll
get
particles
of
stuff
floating
around
in
your
beer
which
i
dont
mind
at
all
for
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
its
more
on
the
edge
of
the
bitter
side
but
still
has
a
taste
that
most
american
pale
wheat
ale
drinkers
will
appreciate
this
is
a
good
beer
but
is
it
one
of
my
favorites
probably
not
md
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
not
very
complex
but
is
very
well
made
very
refreshing
i
can
see
it
being
a
great
summer
beer
for
an
excellent
seasonal
offering
this
is
the
one
by
any
means
not
the
best
beer
one
the
market
but
if
you
just
want
a
solid
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
it
nice
taste
nice
feel
excellent
drinkability
what
more
could
you
ask
for
locally
they
offer
it
on
tap
along
with
an
orange
slice
in
it
if
youre
an
orangesliceinyourbeerdrinker
youll
be
in
heaven
if
youre
a
man
dont
let
anyone
see
you
but
its
good
perfect
level
of
carbonation
which
makes
this
beer
very
quaffable
this
has
become
my
go
to
summer
beer
if
you
like
wheat
beers
or
pale
ales
this
is
a
winner
in
my
book
the
flavor
is
also
pretty
bland
and
void
of
any
assertive
flavors
most
just
a
little
breadiness
and
some
wheat
malt
a
subtle
bitterness
balances
the
light
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
medium
full
with
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
well
above
average
for
this
beer
even
with
the
fuller
body
this
is
my
definition
of
an
average
beer
i
know
how
popular
this
beer
is
with
newer
craft
beer
drinkers
as
well
as
bmc
drinkers
looking
for
a
change
it
is
unoffensive
pretty
well
made
and
light
in
flavor
in
exchange
for
making
this
a
great
conversion
beer
it
suffers
from
having
any
character
drinkability
the
mix
of
sweet
and
fresh
characters
from
the
wheat
and
malts
makes
is
very
refreshing
but
not
too
overpowering
an
alcohol
flavor
seems
a
little
too
noticeable
for
the
abv
and
style
this
beer
pours
a
yellow
orange
with
a
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
leaving
some
lacing
arond
the
glass
the
smell
is
fruity
some
earthy
grassiness
mild
hops
the
beer
is
crisp
wheaty
mild
hops
and
nice
fruit
sweetness
nice
carbination
and
goes
down
smooth
fairly
aggressive
pour
leaves
a
solid
inch
of
frothy
head
with
moderate
lacing
some
floral
and
grassy
notes
in
the
smell
as
well
as
some
citrus
coming
through
a
real
nice
citrus
sweetness
upfront
in
this
ale
with
some
nice
earth
and
wheat
tones
in
the
finish
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
so
far
i
have
liked
everything
i
have
had
from
bells
my
only
complaint
with
them
is
that
their
bottle
designs
are
just
plain
ugly
d
ive
had
this
beer
before
twice
from
a
bottle
and
one
on
tap
at
bells
this
is
a
really
good
beer
of
theirs
they
did
a
good
job
now
that
its
getting
colder
out
i
prolly
wouldnt
go
seeking
it
out
now
but
it
could
easily
fill
out
my
six
pac
if
i
couldnt
find
a
winter
beer
but
i
would
drink
this
all
the
time
in
the
warm
weather
if
i
could
i
liked
this
im
normally
not
fond
of
summer
beers
but
the
subtle
sweetness
of
oberon
won
me
over
on
top
of
that
its
got
above
average
abv
but
it
still
drinks
well
d
i
cant
drink
any
more
im
going
to
pour
it
out
maybe
i
have
a
bad
sample
maybe
i
just
dont
like
this
style
but
i
cant
stand
this
one
its
not
worth
the
pain
to
me
lucky
enough
to
have
a
friend
who
makes
mid
west
beer
runs
and
to
able
to
sample
this
pours
an
orange
amber
with
lots
of
good
stuff
floating
around
there
is
an
overpowering
orange
aroma
going
on
from
start
to
finish
really
amazing
stuff
i
can
only
imagine
what
it
tastes
like
fresh
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
it
is
incredibly
refreshing
and
worth
tracking
down
if
possible
a
very
great
widely
distributed
beer
thatd
be
great
on
both
a
hot
day
and
a
cool
day
highly
recommended
figured
id
grab
one
o
these
guys
before
they
disappear
for
the
rest
of
the
year
it
pours
a
pretty
clear
pale
straw
riddled
with
particulates
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
healthy
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
mandarin
orange
flesh
puffed
rice
and
wet
wheat
the
taste
comprises
corn
syrup
wheat
light
mandarin
orange
and
flowers
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
thickly
watery
feel
overall
a
decent
apwa
nothing
close
to
special
but
highly
drinkable
bottom
line
i
like
bells
but
its
too
expensive
down
south
here
so
i
dont
get
it
as
much
as
id
like
a
nice
whiteyellow
hue
very
reminiscent
of
a
quality
belgian
hefe
although
you
could
tag
the
usual
banana
clove
and
citrus
labels
this
establishes
something
more
enjoyable
unfortunately
seasonal
this
could
last
through
the
fall
relaxed
palette
not
overwhelmingly
wheat
or
feminine
pleasantly
subtle
would
definitely
pair
well
with
certain
foods
larry
bell
should
really
get
his
stuff
to
the
east
coast
more
consistently
id
surely
stock
this
in
the
fridge
a
good
allaround
summer
staple
with
plenty
of
punch
it
tastes
sweet
from
the
start
maybe
starting
citrusy
and
moving
towards
the
wheatyeast
character
but
finishes
like
a
good
tartpeppery
wine
i
dont
love
the
sweetness
and
for
that
reason
am
marking
it
down
but
its
still
a
very
good
beer
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
prickly
wouldnt
seek
out
but
would
drink
again
very
sessionable
bubbly
and
refreshing
and
hoppy
great
summerwarm
weather
brew
a
drinkable
and
very
good
tasting
brew
give
it
a
shot
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
great
flavor
easy
and
extremely
enjoyable
to
drink
one
of
my
favorite
summertime
wheat
beers
o
very
refreshing
and
perfect
for
summer
where
other
summer
beers
are
watered
down
this
beer
actually
has
some
supporting
body
with
the
pale
and
wheat
malt
overall
only
the
smell
leaves
something
to
be
desired
one
of
the
easiest
wheat
beers
to
drink
in
my
opinion
db
a
good
fruit
flavor
in
this
beer
it
tastes
pretty
fresh
and
the
citrus
is
not
overly
zesty
pretty
well
balanced
and
definitely
refreshing
poured
into
glass
with
quickly
disappearing
head
usually
i
garnish
this
with
an
orange
today
did
not
have
any
but
either
way
a
good
beer
for
a
nice
90
degree
day
usual
wheat
beer
taste
but
i
really
enjoy
these
on
hot
days
will
get
couple
cases
again
in
2011
d
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
great
session
beer
ive
had
a
sixpack
in
a
night
and
know
many
others
who
have
as
well
d
a
very
good
example
of
the
american
version
of
witte
beer
d
very
good
beer
to
relax
and
enjoy
on
a
warm
day
a
good
allaround
easy
drinking
beer
and
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
ive
had
drinkability
for
a
summer
wheat
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
definitely
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
is
an
awesome
summer
beer
super
refreshing
with
a
great
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
all
day
long
in
the
summer
heat
worth
hunting
down
for
the
summer
overall
i
very
good
summer
ale
for
sure
i
much
larger
fan
of
other
wheat
beers
such
as
north
coasts
blue
star
or
averys
white
rascal
but
its
a
solid
beer
d
i
put
the
beer
down
in
about
1015
seconds
once
i
got
my
first
taste
i
couldnt
stop
drinking
it
nectar
of
the
gods
sums
this
up
perfectly
mix
the
perfect
taste
with
a
decent
abv
and
you
have
a
session
brew
sometimes
ales
are
a
little
too
sweet
and
caramelly
for
me
so
at
times
im
hesitant
to
choose
an
ale
this
was
a
good
one
a
fullbodied
flavor
the
malt
wasnt
too
sweet
but
there
was
that
hint
a
little
hint
of
hops
balanced
nicely
i
might
have
had
another
had
the
tenderloin
not
just
come
off
the
grill
then
i
guess
this
beer
reopened
an
avenue
of
beers
for
me
that
had
been
under
construction
drinkability
very
nice
summer
brew
easily
drinkable
perfect
after
a
hot
hard
days
work
this
beer
is
better
than
most
summer
wheat
beers
ive
tried
i
intend
to
pick
up
a
cask
of
this
ive
seen
them
around
several
stores
unlike
two
hearted
i
dont
think
this
should
be
aged
just
drink
it
now
very
nice
summer
wheat
on
tap
at
the
farmhouse
nice
head
a
bit
yeasty
for
me
balanced
mouthfeel
goes
down
pretty
easy
on
warm
summer
day
id
much
prefer
a
hopslam
or
two
hearted
but
not
bad
for
the
style
bells
has
yet
to
produce
a
beer
that
i
have
not
liked
the
price
was
expensive
the
beer
was
ok
this
tastes
great
on
a
saturday
afternoon
by
the
grill
there
is
some
bright
citrus
upfront
followed
by
orange
and
finished
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
i
can
usually
drink
a
few
of
these
in
the
afternoon
however
if
it
is
hot
outside
i
find
myself
resorting
to
something
that
sits
lighter
in
my
stomach
absolutely
delicious
summer
beer
here
extremely
easy
to
put
down
and
id
imagine
itd
be
awesome
on
a
hot
day
i
truly
love
this
beer
one
of
the
best
i
have
yet
to
drink
a
bad
beer
from
bells
it
was
an
easy
drinking
beer
definitely
could
have
had
more
i
would
buy
this
again
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
change
of
pace
mdthis
is
a
fantastic
summer
beer
it
is
one
of
the
best
american
unfiltered
wheat
beers
i
have
had
d
highly
drinkable
without
all
the
spices
getting
in
the
way
like
they
do
with
some
beers
goes
does
smooth
and
is
quite
refreshing
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
this
was
pretty
damn
good
ive
been
putting
this
one
off
for
some
time
and
im
glad
i
finally
went
for
it
good
goto
for
the
style
d
it
is
certainly
refreshing
and
drinkable
but
the
flavours
are
just
understated
and
appearance
lets
it
down
also
not
bad
d
quite
drinkable
with
a
very
nice
body
and
good
wheat
character
the
spices
get
just
a
bit
phenolic
in
the
middle
and
this
characteristic
is
emphasized
by
the
herbal
hops
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
though
it
isnt
something
that
really
does
it
for
me
and
i
would
not
seek
it
out
again
this
has
a
smooth
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
which
in
turn
lends
to
it
being
a
highly
drinkable
beer
an
excellent
summer
session
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
for
the
next
cookout
a
word
of
advice
though
dont
ruin
the
taste
by
popping
a
lemon
or
orange
in
it
enjoy
it
as
bells
intended
one
of
my
more
enjoyable
summer
beer
experiences
unlike
most
summer
wheats
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
not
that
5
8
will
kick
your
ass
but
it
has
a
little
more
oomf
that
most
summer
beers
dont
have
its
semisweet
and
you
get
a
nice
dose
of
wheat
flavor
again
followed
by
orange
not
my
favorite
beer
but
its
an
excellent
choice
for
the
summer
and
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
it
is
most
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
near
by
but
i
wouldnt
make
a
special
trip
to
michigan
for
this
one
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
thicker
than
it
should
be
and
slightly
sweet
overall
its
a
very
nice
beer
for
summer
overall
this
is
a
very
good
summer
wheat
beer
it
may
be
a
bit
to
fruity
for
some
tastes
but
i
quite
enjoyed
it
mouthfeel
was
my
favorite
aspect
of
this
one
dgreat
summer
beer
out
in
the
sun
but
its
nothing
complex
or
really
flavorful
imo
d
if
this
beer
was
available
around
here
id
most
likely
be
drinking
quite
a
lot
of
it
over
the
summer
ive
been
putting
this
one
off
for
god
knows
what
reason
i
love
everything
that
bells
comes
out
with
and
now
i
am
satisfied
d
i
finally
get
to
try
the
midwest
summer
classic
bells
oberon
for
the
style
its
above
average
better
than
blue
moon
but
it
does
remind
me
a
lot
of
that
beer
the
bitter
spice
component
is
similar
in
both
beers
goes
down
well
a
bit
too
sweet
but
its
not
overthetop
on
the
sweetness
nor
the
spice
the
slight
hop
bite
helps
to
keep
this
wellbalanced
and
relatively
drinkable
a
decent
warmweather
brew
small
white
head
retains
as
a
cap
over
golden
with
yellow
edges
good
lacing
aromas
are
faint
fruitiness
and
wheat
with
flavors
mirroring
what
im
getting
on
the
nose
stone
fruit
and
fresh
graininess
its
a
weird
combination
of
sour
and
ripe
fruits
a
crispy
thin
mouthfeel
helps
it
all
go
down
smoothly
not
sure
id
reach
for
this
again
what
with
all
the
other
incredible
bells
offerings
drinkability
this
is
the
scent
and
taste
of
a
sunny
afternoon
ha
its
tasty
smooth
and
easy
drinking
but
im
a
little
turned
off
by
the
orange
crush
it
does
not
stand
out
on
its
own
it
reminds
me
too
much
of
blue
moon
but
the
hop
bite
at
the
end
does
provide
uniqueness
overall
a
very
well
balance
very
well
done
beer
served
from
tap
into
a
dogfish
head
standard
pint
pours
hazy
yellow
orange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
maintains
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
wheat
fruit
malt
and
skunk
the
flavor
is
of
skunk
subtle
malt
and
wheat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
brew
but
wasnt
really
that
great
either
if
the
skunky
aspect
was
not
present
it
and
there
was
more
of
a
fruit
aroma
this
could
be
nice
i
would
still
drink
this
again
but
just
not
anytime
soon
t
the
rye
does
come
through
and
malt
sour
is
there
as
well
theres
a
wheatyness
to
it
carbonated
refreshing
yet
nothing
truly
jumps
out
but
very
good
effort
this
is
among
the
best
american
pale
wheat
ales
that
ive
had
it
is
different
than
say
boulevard
unfiltered
wheat
or
goose
island
312
but
that
difference
is
helpful
a
good
session
choice
in
the
summer
this
summer
beer
is
impressive
its
a
summer
seasonal
with
a
full
flavor
and
a
fine
blend
of
hops
as
a
wheat
beer
the
wheat
is
suttle
and
pleasant
and
not
too
overbearing
at
all
the
smell
brings
a
floral
sweetness
that
is
modest
and
attractive
it
also
drinks
well
with
good
food
and
compliments
fresh
fish
d
excellent
summer
session
pours
a
pale
copperygolden
with
a
decent
head
that
subsides
quickly
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
foam
and
a
good
amount
of
lacing
nice
floral
aroma
with
piney
hop
notes
detectable
in
the
background
taste
features
more
maltiness
than
i
expected
and
some
woody
vanilla
notes
in
the
aftertaste
okay
mouthfeel
but
could
have
benefitted
from
a
bit
more
combination
i
think
though
not
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
brew
i
found
a
mini
keg
and
will
buy
it
next
time
i
see
it
its
a
great
beer
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
especially
while
sitting
outside
at
the
ballgame
ddrinkability
on
this
one
is
very
high
especially
after
mowing
on
a
summer
day
d
i
could
easily
fill
a
pick
6
of
these
very
drinkable
summer
beer
especially
after
a
long
day
poured
a
hazy
lemon
gold
with
a
modest
white
head
lacing
was
ample
and
lasting
and
lemon
nose
was
citrus
upfront
especially
orange
with
some
wheat
and
breay
malt
obvious
as
well
taste
started
with
sweet
citrus
moderated
by
malts
and
finishing
with
a
crisp
and
pleasing
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
average
for
this
style
lighter
than
medium
with
good
carbonation
this
was
like
everything
from
bells
seems
to
be
a
solid
offering
i
will
try
again
notes
this
beer
shows
all
the
signs
of
a
well
made
beer
which
ive
come
to
expect
from
bells
however
being
good
is
far
short
of
being
great
the
flavor
just
doesnt
work
for
me
it
is
much
too
sweet
a
wheat
ale
should
be
crisp
and
bright
but
this
feels
heavy
and
sugary
notes
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
a
goto
for
a
lighter
beer
that
has
a
nice
warming
body
to
it
d
4
im
having
a
hard
time
thinking
of
this
as
a
summer
beer
it
may
be
brewed
for
mass
consumption
but
in
an
oktoberfest
rather
than
lawnmowerbeer
sort
of
way
the
heft
mouthfeel
and
strength
support
that
impression
it
does
not
of
course
taste
anything
like
a
fest
beer
this
beer
is
wellbalanced
and
encourages
moderately
paced
quaffing
but
beware
of
its
punch
particuarly
if
youre
drawing
from
a
5l
minikeg
drinks
great
for
the
summer
and
is
highly
refreshing
poured
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
decent
1
finger
of
white
head
golden
color
smells
of
tart
citrus
and
a
light
yeasty
bready
scent
tastes
like
tart
citrus
flavors
especially
lemon
some
other
typical
wheat
beer
flavor
refreshing
and
a
little
more
hop
prevalent
than
other
wheats
could
drink
a
couple
more
if
these
if
need
be
bells
does
not
disappoint
recommended
for
a
hot
summer
day
where
you
dont
want
to
compromise
the
breadth
of
flavor
d
this
beer
could
disappear
so
quickly
a
great
refresher
on
a
warm
day
nicely
spicy
and
wheaty
goes
down
like
water
really
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
poured
from
a
5
liter
minikeg
into
a
weizen
glass
pours
a
slighly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
and
low
carbonation
leaves
very
nice
lacing
smells
of
fresh
citrusy
fruits
tangy
and
tart
has
a
very
nice
clean
wheat
malt
profile
with
some
lemon
notes
has
a
nice
meduim
body
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
smooth
very
nice
easy
drinking
wheat
d
really
easy
drinker
could
toss
these
back
all
day
and
night
soft
subtle
with
a
nice
flavor
d
easy
to
drink
and
good
in
the
heat
drinkability
if
its
warm
outside
and
the
sun
is
shining
this
is
a
great
brew
with
which
to
relax
and
enjoy
the
summer
days
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
out
there
light
yet
complex
those
who
tend
to
compare
this
to
macro
swill
confound
me
there
is
so
much
character
in
this
brew
that
cant
be
found
in
any
b
m
or
c
i
wonder
if
any
new
beer
drinker
is
getting
beyond
extreme
brews
this
is
truly
a
perfect
summer
beer
with
a
far
deeper
taste
than
i
initially
expected
on
the
first
sip
there
is
a
light
taste
of
citrus
with
a
fairly
well
rounded
finish
but
every
sip
that
follows
brings
a
different
experience
deeper
citrus
notes
and
the
bitterness
rounds
out
well
the
further
down
the
bottle
i
got
at
its
price
point
it
is
truly
a
great
beer
for
a
summer
party
or
just
sipping
alone
outside
d
very
high
the
crisp
flavor
and
low
abv
make
oberon
one
of
the
most
delicious
and
sessionable
summer
beers
ive
ever
had
very
highly
recommended
oberon
signifies
the
start
of
summer
serve
with
a
orange
and
allow
a
bit
of
foam
to
form
to
induce
the
c02
and
release
the
great
flavor
i
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
is
in
the
middle
of
my
hops
tolerance
range
with
bells
two
hearted
ale
being
too
strong
for
me
i
opt
for
this
beer
for
all
the
summer
season
i
think
of
it
as
a
bit
like
blue
moon
but
with
much
better
hops
flavoring
light
body
with
light
carbonation
as
a
whole
this
is
nothing
special
but
as
a
summer
beer
it
is
enjoyable
all
the
same
on
a
hot
day
quite
refreshing
has
its
place
during
the
summer
pours
a
golden
color
somewhere
between
the
yellow
of
adjunct
lager
and
the
haze
of
a
heifweizen
a
nice
two
finger
head
the
smell
is
nothing
overwhelming
but
it
obviously
smells
like
wheat
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
fruitiness
the
taste
is
nice
i
struggle
for
words
to
describe
it
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
i
dont
love
this
beer
i
certainly
like
it
and
its
one
of
the
better
session
beers
i
have
come
across
d
i
do
not
understand
why
this
beer
does
not
get
slammed
like
others
of
a
similar
style
do
this
is
really
no
different
than
most
of
the
beers
being
advertised
by
brewpubs
as
hefeweizens
lets
be
honest
this
is
a
summer
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
trying
to
be
nothing
but
that
on
that
level
it
excels
awesome
thick
foamy
head
that
is
around
forever
nose
is
mild
and
the
taste
is
wheat
yeast
and
pale
malts
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
beer
is
crazy
drinkable
i
dont
like
this
summer
beer
stuff
normally
but
if
i
had
to
drink
one
this
is
it
d
very
drinkable
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
would
enjoy
some
pool
side
had
on
tap
at
mad
mex
pours
a
very
light
amber
almost
golden
with
a
tint
of
red
smells
wheaty
with
a
little
hop
nose
mostly
lighter
malts
hit
the
nose
tastes
like
banana
wheat
with
a
touch
of
clove
a
tad
bit
of
citrus
is
apparent
maybe
a
little
chalk
a
little
honey
sweetness
is
also
noticeable
slightly
bitter
with
good
carbonation
refreshing
as
its
rather
light
tasting
good
summertime
beer
a
thirst
quencher
bells
oberon
ale
poured
a
lighter
amber
color
with
a
good
head
that
dispated
with
the
beer
and
there
was
small
sized
sediemnt
present
as
well
the
beer
smelled
like
wheat
and
oranges
the
taste
wsa
of
a
very
flavorfull
wheat
beer
and
there
was
a
very
strong
orange
taste
as
well
it
was
lighter
but
very
flavorfull
easy
to
drink
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
would
have
it
again
great
summer
ale
d
bit
of
a
heavier
beer
but
also
can
be
more
refreshing
that
others
the
drinkability
can
really
depend
on
what
youre
doing
and
what
time
of
year
it
is
it
is
highly
drinkable
outside
in
the
warm
sun
while
you
watch
the
sweat
bead
down
the
glass
but
not
so
much
in
fall
when
youre
inside
and
the
batch
has
gotten
older
12oz
bottle
yellow
gold
cloudy
color
very
nice
white
head
doughy
aroma
with
some
spice
lightly
sweet
up
front
mediumtolight
body
silky
soft
texture
very
pleasant
one
of
the
most
pleasant
memories
of
my
life
was
playing
disc
golf
in
august
with
my
brother
in
michigan
after
years
of
being
gone
from
the
state
a
sixpack
of
oberon
was
involved
so
i
am
partial
to
this
beer
for
sentimental
reasons
the
quintessential
summertime
beer
d
i
find
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
one
of
my
goto
summer
beers
i
can
easily
throw
back
23
after
a
day
of
yardwork
in
the
sweltering
georgia
heat
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
drinkability
this
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
light
not
too
filling
not
too
high
on
abv
but
high
enough
no
lingering
aftertaste
d
this
is
just
about
as
drinkable
as
your
typical
miller
lite
or
high
life
now
dont
get
me
wrong
when
im
unwinding
with
my
buddies
and
looking
for
a
night
out
nothing
beats
8
or
9
miller
lites
or
high
lifes
but
that
is
certainly
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
craft
beer
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
nice
long
lasting
white
head
nose
is
wheat
and
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
wheat
lemon
grass
and
white
pepper
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
refreshing
good
carbonation
the
saaz
hops
liven
things
up
overall
drinkability
is
good
this
makes
for
a
good
lawnmower
or
early
fall
tailgate
beer
go
hawks
hazy
golden
sun
color
white
thin
band
around
edge
citrusy
with
a
very
slight
yeasty
character
but
the
orange
is
forefront
and
standout
mouth
feel
has
medium
carbination
and
a
slightly
viscious
consistancy
very
drinkable
during
the
summer
months
but
not
appealing
to
me
during
the
other
6
and
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
id
rather
drink
chilled
then
room
temperature
an
interesting
beer
very
drinkable
and
nice
hops
are
big
in
this
beer
and
really
give
it
a
strong
potpouri
type
flavor
alongside
an
earthy
summer
wheat
beer
pours
a
bright
golden
orange
with
huge
plume
of
white
frothy
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
good
lacing
smell
is
of
lemon
pepper
yeast
fresh
dried
grain
light
sweetness
taste
is
big
on
sweet
citrus
cut
down
slightly
with
the
spice
and
finnishing
with
the
tastes
of
fresh
grain
and
bread
medium
bodied
for
the
style
actively
carbonated
a
nice
refreshing
beer
maybe
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
this
is
a
very
good
drinkable
brew
would
be
excellent
for
summer
or
any
time
of
year
for
that
matter
had
a
couple
of
tall
20
glasses
the
other
night
at
paisanos
in
tr
with
dinner
pours
a
light
yellowish
gold
with
a
thick
slowly
dissipating
head
smell
is
rather
weak
as
expected
in
a
wheat
offering
tastes
of
wheat
and
light
hops
and
i
will
say
this
is
better
on
draft
than
in
a
bottle
although
i
like
it
either
way
clean
finish
light
mouthfeel
and
slightly
watery
and
easy
to
drink
a
pile
of
this
stuff
another
winner
from
bells
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
appropriate
for
summer
and
it
went
well
the
the
light
lunch
that
accompanied
it
as
apwas
go
this
one
is
quite
good
gumballhead
might
be
its
only
competitor
but
i
still
regularly
order
other
things
a
pretty
good
ale
summer
ale
that
is
tasty
doesnt
go
overboard
on
anything
but
doesnt
stand
out
either
drinkable
as
well
but
not
a
lot
of
character
i
could
def
pound
a
few
of
these
in
the
summer
but
it
comes
on
a
little
too
dry
especially
for
the
type
of
beer
its
trying
to
be
decent
enough
new
wold
wheat
ale
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
one
i
like
again
after
thinking
it
was
too
dumbed
down
for
my
sophisticated
palate
i
guess
thats
a
mark
of
maturity
but
dont
expect
me
to
accept
any
bmc
soon
d
really
easydrinking
beer
great
for
a
nice
hot
day
overall
oberon
has
vastly
improved
in
heft
and
drinkability
over
the
past
5
years
or
so
at
least
to
my
perception
i
go
through
about
a
case
or
so
a
summer
as
it
is
a
good
go
to
beer
when
you
have
company
overcookout
etc
i
bet
bells
will
can
12
oz
this
soon
the
wheat
malt
flavortexture
is
very
good
better
than
most
of
this
styles
competitiors
who
seem
very
thin
and
very
weak
doverall
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
its
fermented
to
the
carbination
is
high
but
it
along
with
the
bitterness
balances
the
beers
sweet
taste
out
well
d
love
it
and
i
drink
it
quite
often
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
verging
on
orange
colour
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
of
orange
and
wheat
is
quite
nice
the
taste
had
orange
with
some
faint
lemon
with
the
bready
wheat
beer
flavour
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
the
taste
too
very
smoothly
carbonated
and
an
awesome
beer
for
sitting
outside
with
on
a
nice
day
like
it
says
on
the
bottle
oberon
our
summer
ale
an
american
wheat
ale
with
the
color
and
scent
of
a
summer
afternoon
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
is
unfiltered
and
full
of
flavor
pours
a
cloudy
amber
orange
color
with
a
nice
rich
mouthfeel
perfect
for
relaxing
on
the
porch
on
a
summers
day
overall
im
not
terribly
impressed
with
oberon
ive
had
it
a
number
of
times
and
cant
say
it
has
ever
really
stuck
with
me
there
are
many
other
examples
in
this
and
other
similar
style
categories
that
id
choose
first
drinkability
i
could
easily
have
another
one
other
than
the
lack
of
lacing
its
a
very
drinkable
summer
ale
perfect
for
hot
days
and
it
goes
well
with
meals
and
by
itself
overall
i
was
disappointed
the
bottle
i
had
last
year
seemed
much
better
i
had
thought
about
purchasing
as
six
pack
of
this
but
now
i
dont
think
i
will
i
know
this
beer
is
loved
by
many
but
its
not
my
favorite
firstly
use
caution
when
pouring
this
beer
a
bit
too
quick
and
you
will
end
up
with
chunky
floaters
of
protein
throughout
its
a
lot
prettier
when
its
orange
and
clear
with
a
nice
white
head
that
sticks
in
rings
smell
is
lightbutsweet
spiced
bread
with
an
alcohol
flare
taste
was
a
combo
of
grapefruit
and
orange
zest
and
wheaty
with
a
certain
greenness
to
it
body
was
carbonated
well
and
the
beer
finished
with
some
of
that
particular
candy
sweetness
that
i
detect
from
bells
offerings
in
the
end
crisp
and
refreshing
and
quite
easy
to
drink
a
few
d
very
nice
good
abv
not
too
strong
but
not
weak
by
any
means
definitely
refreshing
and
a
great
summer
beer
d
awesome
summer
quencher
from
bells
not
as
flavourful
or
complex
as
three
floyds
gumballhead
but
still
a
great
take
on
the
style
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonals
it
is
very
drinkable
both
on
tap
and
out
of
a
bottle
finishing
off
a
six
pack
should
be
no
problem
is
a
great
session
beer
and
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
whos
a
fan
a
pale
wheat
ales
story
time
when
i
turned
21
i
was
mostly
just
interested
in
drinking
what
was
on
sale
i
thought
that
ordering
a
killians
meant
i
was
going
for
the
quality
stuff
then
someone
at
a
party
asked
if
i
had
ever
tried
oberon
i
fell
in
love
with
it
right
away
and
it
lead
to
bells
amber
then
that
lead
to
two
hearted
and
kalamazoo
stout
and
then
on
to
other
great
brewers
and
beer
i
raise
my
glass
you
larry
bell
and
drunk
guy
at
party
you
changed
my
life
for
the
better
an
ok
beer
but
not
really
my
favorite
a
little
to
dry
for
me
notes
nice
one
nothing
to
rave
about
but
very
reliable
and
pleasing
or
maybe
those
are
actually
reasons
enough
to
rave
about
even
it
is
not
that
memorable
every
year
this
beer
means
spring
will
soon
be
summer
very
drinkable
beer
d
nicely
put
together
wheat
beer
with
lots
of
fruitiness
and
a
pretty
prominent
malt
presence
d
just
a
very
solid
beer
certainly
drinkable
all
night
long
draught
the
headkeeper
this
one
pours
a
hazy
strawyellow
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
frothy
white
head
on
it
it
left
some
lacing
the
nose
is
grassy
floral
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
grassy
and
floral
notes
as
well
as
corn
citrus
and
some
faint
wheat
nice
and
fairly
refreshing
a
good
summer
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
served
a
hazy
orangeish
yellow
with
a
one
finger
head
has
a
slight
fruit
smell
maybe
some
orange
has
a
nice
refreshing
subtle
citrus
flavor
this
is
a
smooth
and
refreshing
summer
beer
i
will
definitely
hvae
this
again
dim
not
a
big
fan
of
the
lemonlime
hop
profile
or
of
pale
wheats
it
seems
if
this
beer
funds
bells
to
continue
to
make
great
beers
like
two
hearted
and
hopslam
though
then
so
be
it
d
very
refreshing
and
not
overly
sweet
or
bitter
drinkability
pretty
easy
to
toss
back
a
couple
of
these
the
fact
that
no
one
aspect
of
this
beer
sticks
out
makes
it
fairly
unoffensive
to
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
goes
well
with
warm
weather
pours
golden
orange
with
a
thin
1
inch
head
pleasant
aroma
hints
of
mint
and
lemon
zest
medium
body
and
carbonation
without
any
drastic
hints
of
anything
while
not
incredibly
complex
still
a
very
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
throwing
back
a
few
on
a
summer
evening
all
hail
oberon
d
this
would
be
nice
to
drink
for
a
day
out
in
the
sun
very
refreshing
and
not
overly
sweet
or
bitter
medium
body
nice
carbonation
in
the
mouth
some
sweetness
finishes
wet
some
grainy
bitterness
in
back
its
a
good
summertime
light
ale
for
drinking
after
a
hot
day
a
very
nice
summer
beer
fairly
simple
but
very
enjoyable
something
i
would
recommend
d
i
would
perfer
a
2
hearted
ale
over
a
oberon
this
is
not
a
bad
summer
beer
just
personal
preference
i
had
to
check
this
one
out
maybe
ill
pick
it
up
again
next
summer
d
easy
to
throw
back
overall
not
a
bad
beer
it
was
good
to
relax
with
after
mowing
the
grass
notes
good
mouthfeel
that
is
medium
to
slightly
thin
all
in
all
somewhat
underwhelmed
given
the
truly
exceptional
bells
product
ive
had
before
d
goes
down
very
easy
could
and
will
drink
this
all
night
average
drinkability
definitley
worth
trying
especially
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
entirely
enjoyable
albeit
predictable
summer
wheat
best
when
ice
cold
cheers
dvery
drinkable
for
the
summer
though
not
my
favorite
as
i
prefer
sweeter
beers
but
glad
i
tried
it
md
thin
light
body
is
somewhat
deceptive
given
its
abv
ends
dry
and
clean
easy
to
drink
wish
i
could
get
it
here
easily
d
i
dont
know
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
oberon
but
i
can
see
this
having
a
home
in
my
fridge
for
the
duration
of
summer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
pepperlike
spices
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
black
pepper
and
orange
reminds
me
of
orange
sherbet
very
low
bitterness
low
carbonation
and
a
medium
creamy
soft
mouthfeel
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
i
think
this
was
an
ok
wheat
ale
the
taste
was
pretty
nice
but
there
was
nothing
to
the
smell
and
it
looked
terrible
i
would
give
it
another
try
though
just
based
off
the
taste
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
category
before
but
as
i
try
more
and
more
apwa
i
just
realize
i
hadnt
been
drinking
the
good
stuff
before
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
after
having
this
many
times
this
is
the
only
real
summer
beer
i
look
forward
to
and
continue
to
drink
regularly
excellent
beer
overall
and
by
far
the
best
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
at
least
i
could
drink
these
all
day
not
a
beer
i
would
order
at
a
restaurant
but
definitely
something
i
would
have
handy
in
the
fridge
for
a
lazy
day
drinkability
as
it
says
on
the
bottle
an
american
wheat
ale
with
the
color
and
scent
of
a
summer
afternoon
for
me
this
is
a
great
brew
to
casually
drink
on
a
hot
midwestern
summer
afternoon
crisp
refreshing
taste
lowmedium
alcohol
content
and
there
is
something
brewed
in
there
that
just
reminds
me
of
summer
right
off
the
bat
one
can
tell
this
beer
is
light
in
the
ass
goldish
color
fills
the
glass
with
minimal
head
decent
citrus
orange
aroma
is
present
at
first
sniff
very
light
malty
bitters
on
this
wheaty
ale
nice
carbonation
resulting
in
a
very
drinkable
springsummer
beer
this
beer
when
poured
into
glass
had
a
nice
frothy
white
head
and
was
very
cloudy
laced
the
glass
fairly
well
this
beer
does
not
have
a
very
strong
smell
i
could
not
pick
up
on
any
hops
just
from
smell
it
reminded
me
of
most
wheat
beers
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
calm
taste
it
is
balanced
and
smooth
leading
to
a
high
score
on
the
mouthfeel
and
is
all
around
a
very
drinkable
beer
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
change
the
furnace
filter
it
will
be
hot
before
you
know
it
overall
a
great
drinking
lighter
style
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
like
i
said
a
sure
sign
of
summer
there
is
a
reason
this
is
my
wifes
favorite
beer
its
just
so
damn
easy
to
drink
another
winner
by
bells
d
oberon
is
on
the
shelves
summer
is
almost
here
i
drink
this
one
often
summertime
mainstay
in
my
fridge
look
forward
to
the
release
of
oberon
every
spring
deep
hazy
orangeyellow
nice
carbonation
that
steadily
feeds
the
creamy
head
nice
lacings
on
the
glass
light
citrusy
orange
aromas
and
flavors
light
hoppy
beginning
that
seems
to
magnify
at
the
finish
not
as
much
character
as
i
expected
after
such
a
nice
pour
good
refreshing
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
will
make
a
nice
summer
picnic
ale
drinkability
medium
body
with
a
lighter
taste
i
definitely
could
enjoy
more
than
a
few
for
me
this
almost
defines
the
hefeweizen
pale
wheat
style
notes
light
and
refreshing
body
huge
flavor
d
i
could
rate
this
higher
but
am
not
going
to
because
i
think
that
after
3
or
4
of
these
i
would
want
something
else
i
could
drink
this
all
through
the
summer
and
like
it
every
time
however
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
a
few
i
was
surprised
on
the
abv
on
this
one
a
nice
beer
great
for
summer
bbqs
d
insanely
quaffable
a
could
drink
these
one
right
after
another
without
any
regret
while
there
is
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beer
its
just
solid
all
the
way
around
and
my
glass
was
empty
before
i
knew
what
happened
this
isnt
the
most
complex
beer
but
the
light
mouthfeel
is
actually
very
welcomed
and
refreshing
the
flavor
is
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
ive
been
doing
yardwork
all
day
and
i
just
took
a
little
oberon
break
now
back
to
work
and
another
oberon
in
a
little
while
refreshing
beverage
that
is
very
good
for
the
style
probably
one
of
the
best
amer
wheats
ive
tried
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
like
those
golden
apples
healthy
white
head
aroma
had
hints
of
sweet
grain
mixed
with
citrus
however
it
wasnt
too
strong
taste
had
mixes
of
citrus
some
spice
kick
to
it
hoppy
bittnerness
going
down
and
a
breadygrainy
texture
could
have
been
a
little
thicker
and
better
carbonated
overall
a
great
beer
to
kick
back
with
this
is
a
pretty
good
but
an
average
beer
pour
some
on
your
burgers
on
the
grill
too
adds
some
fruity
spicy
flavor
good
easy
drinking
summer
beer
non
destinct
smell
doesnt
measure
up
to
taste
very
appealing
color
matched
by
drinkability
soft
aftertaste
small
fruit
flavors
some
enjoy
with
an
orange
i
just
squeezed
a
few
drops
in
so
actual
fruit
wouldnt
over
power
taste
better
on
tap
than
bottle
had
4
on
a
warm
spring
night
and
was
very
happy
with
my
choice
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
pairs
well
with
any
seafood
or
appetizersalad
course
or
by
itself
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
is
one
of
the
quintessential
summer
ales
from
the
midwest
to
me
this
beer
screams
back
porches
bbqs
and
lawmowers
i
will
be
seeing
lots
of
this
in
the
months
to
come
ive
heard
that
as
a
beer
oberon
is
basically
bells
flagship
summer
brew
and
while
it
may
not
be
my
favorite
genre
of
beer
i
will
definitely
stand
behind
my
loyalty
to
bells
brewery
for
making
fine
beers
cheers
to
summer
with
the
first
sips
you
can
already
tell
this
isnt
a
dangerous
beer
but
its
also
no
slouch
with
some
smooth
and
creamy
touches
of
citrus
fruit
sliding
over
the
tongue
like
slippery
river
water
the
orange
is
clearly
the
most
pronounced
flavor
but
its
certainly
mellow
ive
had
the
beer
before
at
the
bar
with
an
orange
slice
served
on
the
top
and
it
definitely
has
a
very
different
flavor
profile
without
the
added
fruit
but
i
stand
by
the
assumption
that
if
a
brewer
wanted
it
to
have
more
orange
flavor
they
would
have
brewed
it
in
you
dont
add
extra
cucumber
to
a
california
roll
even
so
the
smooth
orange
flavor
gets
patted
down
by
the
nice
wheat
and
lemon
end
notes
where
some
wheat
beers
go
for
the
kill
oberon
hangs
back
and
chooses
smoothness
over
chunkiness
if
youve
ever
had
a
thick
and
intense
wheat
beer
then
youll
understand
what
im
saying
tried
one
fresh
as
a
daisy
out
of
the
bottle
a
lot
better
than
my
keg
review
pours
a
slight
hazed
yellowstraw
with
a
frothy
two
finger
head
with
lots
of
large
bubbles
and
a
slowly
dissipating
froth
leaving
intense
lace
and
bits
of
white
particles
of
sediment
throughout
smells
of
strong
sour
yeast
coriander
sweet
clementine
grassy
hay
and
floral
hop
aromas
i
like
how
bold
it
is
now
that
its
fresh
but
some
of
the
barnyard
funk
shows
up
unpleasantly
as
it
warms
but
being
an
american
style
wheat
well
keep
it
cold
tastes
of
orange
rind
bitterness
starts
tart
with
a
bold
grainy
flavor
throughout
a
bit
of
a
thin
body
and
great
carbonation
enjoy
fresh
d
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
and
just
reminds
you
of
summer
refreshing
beverage
that
cant
be
ignored
once
it
is
started
i
wait
all
winter
for
this
beer
to
be
released
oberon
day
is
the
official
start
of
spring
for
me
dthis
is
one
of
those
perfect
summertime
beers
that
you
could
drink
all
night
if
that
was
your
goal
and
beer
was
your
beverage
of
choice
just
had
this
on
tap
at
bostons
in
middleton
for
the
oberon
release
this
is
actually
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
it
was
really
good
reminds
me
of
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
but
a
lot
better
this
will
be
a
great
beer
to
keep
around
during
the
summer
if
more
american
wheat
ales
were
like
this
id
be
happier
about
the
existence
of
this
generally
unremarkable
style
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
from
a
bottle
at
a
tigers
spring
training
game
in
lakeland
florida
pours
a
very
cloudy
orange
aroma
is
very
citrus
tastes
mostly
like
lemon
and
orange
peel
i
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
as
the
citrus
is
a
little
too
overwhelming
as
is
its
a
decent
to
good
white
ale
na
zdravje
is
the
same
nothing
really
stands
out
again
some
citrus
a
little
hops
something
like
a
wheat
beer
but
not
quite
not
sure
what
this
is
going
for
its
a
little
weak
in
flavor
for
a
wheat
beer
i
guess
its
ok
for
a
summer
drinker
a
decent
offering
from
bells
its
not
bad
it
just
isnt
that
special
d
i
dont
care
for
the
style
but
as
far
as
the
style
goes
this
is
in
the
middle
of
the
heap
d
a
nice
drink
for
the
summer
time
i
shouldnt
have
horded
it
so
long
january
is
cold
buy
again
no
there
are
many
better
beers
in
this
style
this
is
yet
another
nice
bells
offering
i
really
enjoy
it
and
wish
it
was
more
available
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summers
day
drinkability
great
flavor
and
low
body
makes
this
the
perfect
summer
beer
the
keg
offered
at
meijers
is
a
great
idea
for
a
party
d
great
example
of
an
american
wheat
great
flavor
and
character
compared
to
all
the
other
bland
wheats
around
if
this
was
available
in
ct
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
throuhout
the
summer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
colorhas
a
nice
head
that
does
lace
and
lingersi
think
this
beer
is
a
tad
thin
some
wheat
and
malt
and
hop
balance
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
but
i
was
not
impressedi
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
then
never
miss
it
againits
by
no
means
bad
but
just
unimpressive
and
a
tad
overpricedi
guess
ya
call
this
a
gateway
beer
i
suppose
its
a
heavy
hitter
in
the
summer
months
d
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
hot
summer
sun
not
sure
why
i
choose
to
review
this
in
january
oberon
is
a
very
satisfying
quenching
type
of
beer
easily
a
very
nice
summer
drinker
as
it
is
its
tasty
enough
here
at
the
start
of
winter
as
with
all
bells
beers
highly
recomended
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
a
brew
that
appeals
more
in
warmer
times
i
could
have
four
slightly
complex
for
the
style
solid
but
i
like
other
bells
brews
better
notes
a
classic
american
session
beer
that
everyone
should
try
this
is
available
year
round
in
fl
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
one
finger
white
head
clump
of
sediment
that
quickly
settles
smell
lightly
toasty
and
buttery
wheat
fruity
and
ever
so
slightly
citric
but
a
little
too
buttery

thoughts
this
beer
is
a
nice
brew
and
i
could
session
it
in
the
summer
time
but
it
is
not
the
biggest
on
the
flavor
department
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
anything
special
either
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
would
not
be
to
bad
after
a
nice
hot
summer
day
perhaps
drinking
this
one
in
the
middle
of
december
isnt
doing
this
beer
justice
given
that
im
sure
itd
be
excellent
on
warm
summer
day
palate
has
a
lightly
sweet
wheat
component
with
balancing
citrus
to
give
it
some
complexity
finish
is
somewhat
fruitytart
in
a
good
way
and
is
rather
easy
drinking
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
small
head
that
disappears
into
a
thin
film
spots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
honey
malt
and
a
tad
of
pineapple
tastes
sweet
and
citrusy
with
a
malt
backbone
quite
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
nice
on
the
carbonation
front
but
i
cant
help
the
feeling
that
this
is
a
little
too
syrupy
its
light
and
sweet
and
quite
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
where
are
the
hops
perhaps
faded
away
as
this
beer
is
a
summer
seasonal
id
love
to
have
it
super
fresh
this
is
a
must
try
for
someone
who
thinks
blue
moon
is
the
best
beer
out
there
similar
to
bm
but
lots
better
its
definitely
a
great
summertime
beer
i
plan
to
buy
more
of
this
and
make
this
more
of
my
goto
session
lawnmower
beer
when
the
seasons
change
drinkability
sessionable
d
high
very
drinkable
on
those
springfall
warm
nights
overall
good
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
but
ive
been
more
impressed
by
this
beer
in
the
past
before
i
tried
to
review
it
a
very
refreshing
beer
drinkability
overall
a
tasty
brew
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
sweet
taste
to
it
definitely
a
beer
you
can
enjoy
throughout
the
whole
night
not
my
top
choice
in
styles
but
good
nonetheless
not
really
my
style
although
bells
is
one
of
my
fave
breweries
well
made
good
wheat
flavor
an
orange
probably
goes
better
with
it
than
a
lemon
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
i
think
theres
plenty
of
citrus
flavor
already
in
it
and
an
appreciable
degree
of
wheat
soft
body
easy
enough
to
drink
one
of
the
best
representations
of
a
wheat
beer
and
certainly
the
best
east
of
sierra
nevada
that
i
can
think
of
huge
rocky
head
served
from
a
jockey
box
at
the
big
pour
in
scottsdale
eventually
settled
down
color
is
golden
with
a
slightly
orange
tint
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
definantly
an
ale
with
a
nice
citrus
note
the
taste
is
simply
that
of
a
fruiity
wheat
beer
i
am
sure
it
is
going
to
be
a
big
hit
here
in
arizona
the
girl
pouring
it
said
it
would
be
available
year
round
in
arizona
starting
next
month
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
light
there
is
a
citrusy
lemony
note
which
is
prominent
but
not
overpowering
aftertaste
is
bready
and
clean
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
and
recommend
this
to
someone
who
wants
a
relatively
light
bodied
wheat
andmalt
profile
and
simple
flavored
ale
with
little
aftertaste
taste
has
some
characteristics
of
a
typical
american
wheat
ale
but
has
a
creamy
yeasty
flavor
that
reminds
me
of
a
german
hefe
without
the
banana
and
cloves
there
is
a
definite
but
soft
hop
flavor
and
just
enough
bitterness
to
finish
clean
and
easy
leaves
nary
a
hint
of
aftertaste
this
is
one
amazing
summer
beer
and
one
i
would
buy
by
the
case
if
it
were
to
be
available
in
texas
deeelicious
this
is
not
a
session
beer
but
so
what
summers
past
and
im
still
enjoying
this
just
as
much
as
when
i
had
the
rest
back
in
august
judging
by
the
number
of
reviews
on
here
a
lot
of
people
have
given
this
a
shot
and
it
seems
to
have
enough
fans
on
here
if
i
could
find
it
on
tap
again
id
have
it
in
a
heartbeat
this
bottled
version
of
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
memories
i
had
of
quaffing
this
in
the
bay
state
bottle
from
the
brewery
refreshing
particularly
in
indian
summer
day
pleasant
malty
aroma
on
a
medium
yellow
body
with
a
lot
of
white
creamy
head
that
leaves
droplets
of
lace
creamy
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
above
average
mouthfeel
pleasant
beverage
throughout
wheat
well
integrated
mild
bitterness
that
finishes
a
tad
sweet
from
wheat
just
as
good
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
as
it
is
ontap
pours
a
golden
amber
color
with
noticeable
sediment
floating
througout
frothy
2
finger
head
and
sticky
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
pint
glass
smells
of
sweet
citrus
and
plenty
of
wheat
and
field
greens
taste
isnt
nearly
as
strong
as
the
nose
much
sweeter
than
other
wheat
beers
but
still
has
the
earthy
tones
that
keeps
me
coming
back
to
this
style
only
complaint
would
be
the
taste
is
a
little
too
watery
for
a
bottle
conditioned
ale
mouthfeel
is
pretty
think
drinkability
is
high
for
the
right
time
of
the
year
while
middle
of
october
isnt
that
d
i
would
say
med
to
high
drink
ability
nice
flavor
d
i
had
a
difficult
time
getting
through
this
one
obviously
its
a
popular
beer
but
something
in
the
yeast
is
really
killing
it
for
me
the
body
was
good
solid
but
light
drinkability
was
very
good
i
could
see
draining
a
sixer
on
a
summer
afternoon
with
no
trouble
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
if
it
were
regularly
available
to
me
it
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
mfd
a
very
carbonated
medium
light
body
quite
drinkable
but
no
where
near
my
first
choice
if
i
want
a
wheat
beer
d
quite
high
my

a

either

333333this
beer
got
straight
threes
that
is
a
compliment
from
me
considering
the
style
the
beer
was
very
cloudy
and
had
the
appearance
of
pineapple
juice
there
was
a
good
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
the
taste
is
good
for
the
style
and
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
mostly
smooth
the
drinkability
is
fair
this
beer
is
average
in
my
book
but
that
is
good
for
me

does
this

make
a
mediocre
beer
this
is
the
fourth

variety

had
onefinger

some

i
smelled
lemon
and
other
citrusy
flavors
i
could
definately
taste
the
yeast
flavor
and
the
citrus
nicely
acidic
but
the
heaviness
combined
with
the
sweetness
made
this

a

much

and
tasted
like
a

not

5one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
the
summer
comes
from
one
of
my
new
top
ten
breweries
in
america
now
i
need
to
update
my
post
so
good
that
i
had
to
fly
some
of
this
home
with
me
from
traverse
city
michigan
just
a
great
wheat
ale
that
i
could
not
get
enough
of
could
be
a
dangerous
session

i
had

this
beer
again
after
its

debut
in

state
of

on

followed
by
slight
hints
of
tropical

coming

taste

slightly
tart

a
nice

good
mild

flavor

which
is
what
you
expect
from
the
aroma
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
am
not
a
hefe
drinker
but
of
all
the
hefes
i
have
tried
this
is
on
of
the
better
ones
out
there
this
beer
was
a
light
orange
color
and
very
cloudy
with
a
solid
white
head
which
didnt
stick
around
long
the
aroma
was
nice
orange
peel
coriander
wheat
and
a
sort
of
grassy
hop
character
the
taste
wasnt
bad
but
not
near
as
deep
as
the
smell
a
slight
bready
flavor
hits
up
front
followed
by
a

flavor
at
the
back
of

is
when
the
slight
hoppiness
kicks
in
for
a

of
yeast
in
the
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
low
so
it
goes
down

would
be
very

days
poured
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
typical
of
a

bells
pale
ale
was
more

than
this
though
anyway
this
was
a
delightful
beer
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
the
wheat
flavor
do
they
use
honey
at
all
i
am
not
sure
if
i
could
taste
the
residuals
of
honey
but
the
flavor
made
me
think
of
it
good
beer
refreshing
wished
i
had
more
than
the
one

from

poured
a
beautiful

that
was

but
concealing

with

it

like
many
a

it

to
give

of

large
foamy
white
head
its
a
murky
gold
color
with
sediment
actually
visable
maybe
i
didnt
mix
it
in
well
enough
its
taste
is
quite
good
citrus
flavor
in
front
of
a
spicy
hop
bite
in
the
back
one
of
the
better
hefes
that
i
have
had
try
it
out
on
a
hot
day
a
light
dry
transparent
straw
color
quick
head
smells
of
the
yeast
and
an
unleavened
bread
feeling
takes
over
the
taste
is
very
pleasing
much
like
the
bread
somewhat
dry
feel
with
a
nice
bitter
taste
and
a
fresh
citrus
quench
one
of
the
best
wheats
ive
had
this
beer
pours
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
nice
sized
head
that
leaves
a
solid
amount
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
aroma
of
yeast
and
hops
with
a
slight
fruitiness
the
main
flavors
are
of
tarty
fruits
esp
orange
saaz
hops
are
used
and
are
a
perfect
complement
to
the
tartiness
grainy
malts
seem
to
be
in
the
mix
as
well
coriander
is
also
a
strong
flavor
in
this
beer
i
dont
really
know
if
this
should
be
called
a
hefe
but
i
do
know
that
this
is
one
great
beer
from
one
great
brewery
this
brew
poured
a
very
large
invigorated
head
of
finely
sized
white
bubbles
and
a
cloudy
orange
unfiltered
yeasty
body
it
had
a
decent
hop
aroma
and
was
slightly
fizzy
in
its
initial
mouthfeel
while
coming
to
a
smooth
finish
with
its
mild
hop
flavor
this
one
just
begs
for
a
piece
of
cheese
to
enjoy
with
it
drinkability
wow
a
nice
summer
brew
with
great
flavor
and
balance
just
enough
taste
to
lure
you
into
more
perfect
for
summer
i
had
this
one
in
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
bells
pint
glass
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yelloworange
with
many
yeast
chunks
floating
about
there
is
only
1
small
finger
of
head
and
almost
no
lacing
the
smell
is
full
of
fruit
some
citrus
aroma
maybe
orange
the
taste
has
some
citrus
and
peach
flavor
it
is
a
little
yeasty
but
quite
refreshing
the
body
is
fairly
heavy
for
a
wheat
this
fine
summer
ale
also
has
a
great
drinkability
this
wheat
ale
is
very
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
begins
on
the
fruiter
wheat
side
finishes
slightly
dry
and
mildly
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
such
that
it
takes
nothing
to
sip
this
brew
and
one
could
easily
have
many
on
a
warm
summer
evening
slight
carbonation
to
start
with
and
finishes
smooth
and
dry
a
nice
interpretation
of
an
american
wheat
and
a
great
summer
brew
at
that
i
had
a
draw
of
this
while
in
wisconsin
this
prompted
me
to
by
a
six
pack
the
tap
beer
was
good
good
head
nice
taste
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
it
to
bring
home
i
opened
the
beer
no
head
the
nose
was
still
ok
some
fruit
yeast
and
malt
the
taste
still
had
some
bite
but
overall
it
was
just
flat
tasting
compared
to
the
keg
stuff
the
only
thing
that
saved
the
review
is
that
this
is
good
tasting
beer
good
malt
character
and
some
bite
i
will
try
this
again
it
must
be
the
batch
the
beer
smelled
strongly
of
apricots
and
slightly
yeasty
the
fruity
smell
was
more
tart
than
sweet
and
reminded
me
of
magic
hats
9
there
was
no
sweetness
or
tartness
to
the
taste
it
was
very
crisp
and
clean
a
little
yeasty
and
a
very
light
mouthfeel
this
is
decent
summer
ale
light
no
heavy
tastes
although
the
flavor
is
slightly
lacking
its
extremely
drinkable
however
i
had
two
and
thats
a
lot
for
me
in
one
setting
short
attention
span
looks
like
a
belgian
wit
deep
honey
colored
with
thin
white
head
wnd
little
retention
aroma
is
a
bit
yeasty
with
heavy
wheat
malt
presence
very
crisp
on
the
palate
which
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
style
flavor
is
mediocre
a
somewhat
generic
bland
flavor
to
it
that
reminds
me
of
blue
moons
white
no
great
flavors
really
jumping
out
at
you
finishes
slightly
bitter
and
a
little
stale
addenum
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
for
at
least
10
years
back
when
it
was
called
solsun
and
my
only
beef
is
that
it
is
the
most
inconsistent
of
bells
brews
even
varying
between
bottles
of
the
same
6pack
i
have
tried
this
about
10
tens
this
year
2005
and
all
10
times
it
has
sucked
if
i
were
to
go
by
this
years
experience
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
give
it
a
2
5
since
the
move
to
comstock
this
is
now
a
yeasty
pungent
swill
somebody
has
fucked
up
big
time
the
rating
above
is
based
upon
my
prior
tastings
and
i
cant
recommend
it
any
further
originally
sampled
on
2
october
2002
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
the
flavor
has
a
nice
bite
on
the
palate
it
very
much
reminds
me
of
a
white
beer
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
wheat
not
one
of
bells
best
but
certainly
very
good
poured
a
large
envigorating
white
creamy
head
with
fine
bubbles
the
aroma
appeared
to
be
citrusy
the
lacing
was
sparse
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
it
was
bitter
tasting
and
it
left
a
lingering
aftertaste
i
was
expecting
a
better
brew
than
what
this
one
turned
out
to
be
im
not
sure
what
i
have
here
certainly
a
wheat
lightly
tart
and
clean
but
not
at
all
a
phenolic
german
a
fruity
belgian
or
an
insipid
american
surpising
caramel
malt
notes
well
balanced
with
the
wheat
flavors
not
like
any
wheat
ive
had
before
not
spectacular
but
interesting
and
ejoyable
pours
a
cloudy
golden
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
a
lot
of
particles
are
visibly
suspended
in
the
body
aroma
consists
of
wheat
citrus
baking
pizza
dough
some
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
banana
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
starting
off
smooth
then
turning
crisp
pleasant
wheat
flavor
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
middle
a
citrus
finish
rounds
things
out
and
has
a
lingering
grainy
quality
to
it
a
very
refreshing
summer
ale
f
clear
bright
golden
color
with
moderate
lace
and
head
aroma
was
malty
with
somewhat
pungent
yeast
smell
no
aroma
of
hops
at
all
taste
was
smooth
and
malty
with
a
bread
doe
flavor
and
a
dry
mouthfeel
no
apparent
esters
were
noticeable
that
are
typically
found
in
wheat
beers
which
was
disappointing
nice
beer
but
a
little
dry
and
plain
this
beer
is
a
king
among
summer
wheat
beers
take
a
while
to
stare
down
the
artsy
sun
on
the
label
and
it
will
put
you
in
the
mood
for
an
oberon
its
a
saturday
afternoon
type
of
beer
a
great
lead
in
to
a
long
night
fruity
lemonish
and
light
the
perfect
summer
beer
if
this
beer
were
an
artist
it
would
be
van
gogh
a
golden
orange
cloudy
beer
with
a
thin
head
i
detect
the
wheat
presence
in
the
aroma
along
with
tangerines
and
hints
of
lemon
the
wheat
malt
provides
a
nice
texture
smooth
crisp
flavor
an
array
of
fruity
flavors
but
mild
and
very
refreshing
a
mild
hop
presence
very
drinkable
as
noted
on
the
bottle
a
great
summer
brew
pours
almost
no
head
fizzy
very
cloudy
looks
almost
solid
apricotpeachyellowish
color
nice
strong
wheat
aroma
some
cloves
strong
presence
on
the
tongue
oddly
bitter
aftertaste
not
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
most
wheats
very
earthy
i
could
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
though
nice
beer
this
is
an
enjoyable
wheat
beer
although
it
lacks
the
strong
banana
and
cloves
smell
and
taste
i
love
in
hefes
the
nose
on
this
is
yeasty
with
a
strong
whiff
of
sweet
pinneaples
body
is
light
low
carbonation
nice
sweetness
extremely
thirst
quenching
a
great
easy
drinking
summer
beer
with
a
nice
taste
but
lacking
in
special
qualities
i
like
in
my
hefes
seems
ot
be
a
mix
of
a
whit
and
an
american
wheat
and
a
great
hybrid
at
that
if
you
want
a
traditional
bavarian
hefe
this
isnt
it
if
you
want
a
tasty
easy
drinking
summer
wheat
beer
then
this
is
for
you
a
slightly
unique
wheat
beer
but
fantastic
and
one
of
my
new
overall
favorite
beers
drinkability
good
for
what
it
is
im
not
a
fan
of
the
american
wheat
style
because
i
think
for
the
most
part
its
a
boring
bland
style
of
beer
however
this
one
is
pretty
good
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
when
the
weather
turns
hot
and
sticky
during
the
summer
it
pours
a
nice
bronzeorange
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
body
is
a
little
cloudy
but
hey
it
should
be
the
taste
was
fruity
citrus
and
breadlike
a
remarkably
smooth
drinking
beer
that
you
wont
even
realize
that
you
drank
ten
or
twelve
of
them
till
you
get
your
tab
i
recommend
this
be
consumed
on
a
patio
in
the
sun
then
well
into
the
night
bright
orangeyellowish
color
with
small
suspended
yeast
particles
floating
around
has
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
light
citrus
aroma
light
bready
malty
flavors
it
leaves
a
flowery
aftertaste
it
has
a
very
creamy
and
full
mouthfeel
not
as
spicy
and
fruity
as
i
remember
still
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
this
beer
says
summer
to
me
yes
it
does
speak
and
it
says
shhhhh
dont
say
anything
listen
to
me
bubble
look
at
my
cloudy
golden
orange
color
with
slight
white
head
smell
me
im
all
about
spice
and
everything
nice
like
clove
and
vanillaearthy
hop
and
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
to
tempt
you
come
taste
me
im
quite
yummy
if
i
do
say
so
myself
my
aroma
follows
into
the
flavor
spicy
and
yeasty
clove
and
vanilla
citrusy
hop
orange
rind
finish
my
medium
body
is
perfect
for
holding
these
flavors
maybe
a
touch
heavier
than
needed
but
still
refreshing
as
a
summer
quencher
i
look
to
my
glass
to
reply
but
alas
she
is
gone
pours
more
or
less
like
any
other
wheat
beer
a
little
cloudiness
in
its
orangegold
color
with
a
big
white
head
mild
citrus
aromas
but
fairly
undistinguished
and
simple
taste
is
smooth
malty
fruity
and
a
little
buttery
up
front
but
it
moves
to
a
crisp
hop
bitterness
at
the
back
to
me
the
flavors
just
dont
match
up
its
jarring
more
than
balanced
its
ok
but
its
certainly
not
great
pours
a
foggy
darker
yellow
color
with
a
medium
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
and
light
hops
light
bodied
with
flavors
of
hops
and
fruit
but
not
in
big
doses
finish
is
crisp
and
progressively
bitter
throughout
the
glass
i
found
this
to
be
a
little
mundane
but
it
was
not
too
bad
this
beer
pours
a
very
orange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
and
moderate
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
filled
with
hints
of
citrus
and
other
fruit
along
with
wheaty
characteristics
the
taste
was
surprisingly
low
in
wheat
and
very
smooth
this
is
one
of
the
first
bells
beers
that
ive
really
enjoyed
drinking
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
most
people
thanks
feloniousmonk
this
beer
was
a
slightly
cloudy
light
yellow
or
light
gold
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
foam
that
lasted
for
quite
a
while
and
laced
well
the
nose
was
quite
nice
and
included
malt
some
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
a
fruit
sense
there
was
a
strong
sense
of
tartness
and
a
bit
of
fruit
and
grain
in
the
taste
with
just
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
overall
sense
of
this
beer
is
of
a
relatively
full
body
and
a
pleasant
lingering
taste
that
finishes
a
bit
sweet
and
sour
complex
on
tap
thanks
to
fm
color
poured
a
super
pale
hazy
light
yellow
and
had
a
very
tight
leveled
out
type
of
lacing
just
above
the
white
head
smells
of
zesty
lemon
and
some
spice
very
clean
and
crispy
taste
is
much
like
belgian
witbeir
very
spritzy
lemon
is
sharply
toned
with
a
spicyness
mixed
in
that
blended
well
its
mostly
lemony
then
anything
imagine
a
sprite
or
7up
with
three
times
the
lemon
and
add
some
wheat
and
yeast
and
whamo
youve
got
this
oberon
ive
had
it
in
the
bottle
before
but
on
tap
is
so
much
more
yeasty
fresh
then
from
the
bottle
super
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
for
quenching
thirst
on
warm
to
hot
days
in
summer
there
are
many
tasty
thirstquenching
wheats
out
there
but
only
one
oberon
the
fruitiness
really
pushes
it
forward
supreme
acheivement
and
a
beer
ill
be
enjoying
all
summer
long
thanks
to
feloniousmonk
for
this
bottle
on
the
pour
a
magnificently
chill
hazed
golden
yellow
color
the
head
is
mountainous
in
size
creamy
in
consistency
and
as
it
erodes
the
lace
left
behind
is
a
fine
cover
upon
the
glass
the
aroma
of
yeast
orange
peels
sweet
malt
quite
a
treat
for
this
old
nose
sweet
with
lots
of
malt
the
top
middling
in
feel
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
moderate
acidity
the
hops
spicy
in
their
persistent
bite
dry
as
a
desert
bone
aftertaste
quite
a
nice
beer
this
was
a
very
pleasing
domestic
wheat
beer
that
would
be
great
in
the
summer
months
overall
a
good
wheat
ale
a
nice
balance
of
malt
to
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
a
touch
of
spice
a
little
more
carbonation
in
the
body
and
a
little
more
sparkle
on
the
tongue
would
help
make
this
a
much
better
and
more
refreshing
ale
imho
this
opaque
orange
amber
beer
pours
with
a
solid
twofinger
head
that
shows
excellent
retention
it
slowly
fades
to
a
rcoky
layer
of
foam
and
produces
a
delicate
lace
there
is
a
yeast
component
to
the
aroma
but
wheat
and
hops
are
the
dominate
notes
also
a
hint
of
clove
and
coriander
in
there
as
well
impressive
the
taste
is
very
crisp
with
the
wheat
snap
right
up
front
coriandercilantro
notes
are
evident
with
a
slight
sweetness
creeping
in
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
is
coupled
with
some
light
alcohol
notes
the
yeast
contributes
to
the
flavor
but
is
not
evident
as
yeast
as
in
many
wheat
beers
there
is
no
breadiness
to
the
flavor
the
finish
has
a
crisp
wheat
tartness
that
is
very
refreshing
decent
bitterness
lingers
on
the
aftertatse
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
but
not
remarkable
in
any
way
perfect
for
enjoying
any
time
of
the
year
the
drinkability
is
darn
near
exceptional
this
beer
refreshes
satisfies
quenches
and
then
gets
out
of
the
way
i
hope
to
get
a
few
of
these
for
the
summer
i
remember
when
this
beer
was
on
the
top
50
list
and
i
thought
to
myself
i
will
probably
never
get
to
try
that
beer
well
thanks
to
cretemixer
for
sending
me
a
couple
of
these
great
brews
that
only
months
ago
i
believed
to
be
inacessible
it
is
very
much
a
michigan
summertime
staplealthough
my
friends
stock
up
to
drink
it

a
round

me

to
many
of
these
i
thinkand
boy
i
do
miss
it
so
goldenstraw
in
color
with
a
white
head
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
fruity
biscuity
and
sweet
the
flavor
is
biscuit
malt
that
flows
to
a
fruity
sweet
finish
the
beer
is
light
in
body
and
refreshing
a
very
good
easy
drinking
brew
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
this
beer
has
a
really
unique
honey
yellow
color
to
it
with
considerable
haze
and
an
average
head
smell
is
somewhat
weak
dominated
by
crisp
grains
and
citrus
notes
smooth
sweet
citrusy
taste
that
lightens
up
nicely
at
the
end
a
refreshing
feel
to
this
beer
with
a
nice
crispness
at
the
roof
of
the
mouth
typically
good
wheat
beer
drinkability
not
the
best
of
its
style
but
darned
good
i
love
the
cloudy
golden
color
though
some
may
get
turned
off
by
it
not
a
whole
lot
of
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
of
fruity
undertones
hits
me
immediately
very
smooth
taste
that
is
extremely
drinkable
a
great
summer
quencher
and
excellent
beer
to
introduce
premium
beer
to
friends
most
wheat
beers
are
served
with
a
lemon
wedge
but
this
one
doesnt
need
it
i
remember
the
debut
of
this
wine
as
solsun
we
loved
it
then
and
its
still
good
big
candiedorangepeelspreservedinalcohol
aroma
together
with
notes
of
suede
beach
sand
and
watermelon
bold
sweet
attack
delivers
nuances
of
mace
melon
and
green
leaves
sweet
alcohol
fuels
a
galloping
finish
of
fine
grain
and
mineral
bitterness
a
mouthful
i
have
never
had
a
beer
to
my
memory
that
gave
off
the
smell
of
tangy
peanut
butter
the
very
hazy
straw
color
sits
bellow
a
foamy
cloud
of
a
head
the
clean
crisp
flavor
has
a
very
unique
yeast
character
with
a
noticeable
tanginess
and
a
light
malt
with
a
spicy
twang
of
hop
bite
this
is
a
very
complex
and
tasty
beer
had
this
on
tap
after
a
unsatisfactory
sample
in
the
bottle
the
taste
is
much
more
balanced
and
the
flavors
complement
each
other
on
tap
the
overwhelming
apricotorange
flavor
from
the
bottle
is
more
muted
and
adds
to
the
taste
rather
than
dominating
it
very
nice
and
refreshing
hazy
light
orange
topped
by
a
dense
rocky
and
well
retained
head
that
leaves
lace
wheat
tartness
cracker
like
malt
yeast
must
and
a
spicy
saaz
hop
nose
comprise
the
aroma
theres
more
character
aromawise
for
the
insipid
style
sweetness
and
lightly
citrusy
esters
are
discernible
upfront
then
give
way
to
bready
malt
and
a
mild
fruitiness
from
both
wheat
tartness
and
citrusy
hops
the
mild
hop
bitterness
offsets
the
light
residual
sweetness
well
lending
an
overall
balanced
profile
fuller
in
body
than
than
the
typical
american
wheat
yet
light
and
clean
enough
to
lend
excellent
drinkability
finishes
a
touch
sweet
and
lightly
grainy
oberon
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
with
more
overall
character
than
the
average
american
wheat
first
i
really
do
like
this
beer
nice
wheat
beer
thats
not
a
hefe
huge
head
that
settled
slowly
fairly
lacey
too
different
but
adequate
aroma
of
graininess
but
not
necessarily
wheat
in
quality
no
hop
presence
yellowgold
slightly
cloudy
nice

smoothness
medium
feel
a
little
low
on
the

mostly
malty

hops

only
hardly

little

is
in

momentary
but
carries

pear
to
it
too
malty
dry
finish
that
is
satisfying
very
good
summer
ale
ive
never
tasted
a
wheat
beer
as
complex
as
bells
oberon
although
the
appearance
threw
me
off
at
first
its
a
very
pale
and
cloudy
the
taste
certainly
makes
up
for
it
for
a
wheat
beer
its
got
its
dose
of
finishing
hops
which
i
love
its
fairly
carbonated
and
has
some
yeasties
floating
throughout
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
theres
no
other
beer
that
i
can
think
of
that
id
rather
drink
on
a
summer
day
than
oberon
this
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
unique
wheat
beers
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
apricot
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
which
dissapates
quickly
aroma
of
apricots
and
yeast
yeasty
bread
flavor
with
a
touch
of
citrus
excellent
hops
flavor
as
well
something
you
dont
come
across
too
often
in
this
style
of
beer
crisp
very
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
very
refershing
excellent
beer
this
was
a
great
summer
wheat
beer
to
have
at
my
humid
hot
walk
home
i
have
had
this
in
a
bottle
but
on
tap
it
faired
better
than
some
of
their
others
it
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
it
had
a
white
head
that
subsided
while
leaving
little
laceone
drawback
to
the
bar
pouring
the
aroma
was
of
hops
citrus
and
lightly
of
some
spice
the
flavor
was
of
hops
malt
and
citrus
the
finish
was
a
bit
citrusy
tangy
with
some
light
bread
overtones
good
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
huge
hefe
my
first
kalamazoo
brew
and
it
seemed
to
have
survived
the
trip
up
here
overnite
in
hot
trunk
of
a
car
thank
the
beer
gods
very
cloudy
dark
gold
and
thick
nice
head
going
on
here
lots
of
lace
tons
of
yeast
sediment
worked
up
smells
very
citrusy
with
grassy
earthy
undertones
really
doesnt
taste
like
a
traditional
hefe
lots
of
wheat
malt
and
hops
very
refreshing
and
lively
in
mouthfeel
and
character
in
fact
i
have
goose
bumps
drinking
this
because
my
beer
taste
buds
recognize
that
this
is
something
special
a
superb
summer
brew
cheers
to
deuce
for
the
sample
pours
a
super
hazy
golden
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
that
sinks
just
a
little
too
quickly
some
large
yeasties
are
suspended
in
this
brew
smell
is
of
floral
slightly
spicy
hops
and
some
lemony
citrus
sharp
lemonyorangey
citrus
flavor
on
tongue
as
well
as
some
nice
spicy
hoppiness
some
light
bready
yeastiness
is
detectable
as
well
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
one
of
the
best
summer
brews
i
have
had
very
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
my
only
regret
is
that
this
beer
isnt
in
circulation
down
here
in
va
thanks
to
deuce
for
the
sample
darker
orange
color
cloudy
small
pourous
head
i
think
it
smells
like
a
crushed
peach
sharp
citrus
sharp
on
the
tongue
after
it
rolls
over
the
tongue
its
quite
smooth
not
as
much
head
as
a
lot
of
a
head
as
i
was
expecting
but
it
does
have
a
nice
dark
apricot
color
the
first
aroma
and
flavor
that
you
pick
up
is
apricot
a
good
bit
of
it
thats
followed
by
the
expected
wheaty
and
malty
flavors
that
start
to
dominate
towards
the
middle
of
the
glass
some
citric
crispness
is
present
througout
very
little
bitterness
or
hop
characteristics
are
present
this
is
an
awesome
wheat
beer
another
ballsy
beer
from
kalamazo
and
they
dare
to
do
it
with
a
summer
beer
nice
combo
of
wheat
yeast
flavors
leaning
towrds
the
citrusy
end
of
the
spectrum
nice
heft
for
a
hefeweizen
i
could
drink
this
yearround
thanks
proc
i
dont
really
care
for
this
beers
chalky
yellow
body
but
i
love
that
thick
rocky
head
it
doesnt
go
away
overall
a
wonderful
brew
wonderful
spicy
aroma
just
hints
at
the
complexity
and
richness
of
the
flavor
which
is
yeasty
and
wheaty
just
how
drinkable
is
this
beer
well
i
bought
a
case
on
monday
and
i
dont
see
it
lasting
past
tomorrow
thursday
this
cloudy
golden
brew
throws
out
a
nice
frothy
white
head
with
some
retention
nice
vanilla
and
clove
on
the
nose
taste
is
very
refreshing
tangy
aspect
apparent
light
to
medium
body
with
nice
carbonation
wheat
is
there
but
not
overbearing
theres
not
that
huge
phenolic
character
typical
of
a
lot
of
hefeweizens
this
is
a
good
brew
though
great
by
the
pool
hazy
brown
amber
head
settles
in
at
1418
of
an
inch
aroma
is
massive
and
full
nice
nutty
and
sweet
spice
in

pronounced
banana
bread
flavor
but
traces
of
too
sour
notes
hop
bite
starts
flavorful
finishes
astringent
and
thinner
refreshing
as
a
cooler
i
was
looking
for
far
less
acidity
and
sourness
as
implied
by
the
smell
ok
not
a
favorite
though
just
too
sour
not
great
but
i
will
certainly
enjoy
this
one
again
this
beer
is
such
a
great

going

gross
i
couldnt
finish
it
that
says
a
lot
smells
of
sweet
wheat
with
some
light
citrus
they
call
it
an
ipa
but
i
only
get
a
subtle
piney
flavor
not
an
ipa
will
not
reconsider
i
dont
understand
how
this
beer
is
being
so
bashed
i
suppose
naming
it
an
ipa
is
a
bit
misleading
however
name
aside
its
a
great
tasting
spring
and
summer
brew
very
easy
to
drink
and
drink
and
drink
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
and
unfortunately
its
no
longer
kegged
by
ab
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
i
was
disappointed
with
this
beer
as
i
thought
it
would
be
better
it
is
way
overhopped
and
lacking
in
maltiness
it
is
almost
flavorless
if
you
put
aside
the
hop
taste
it
has
a
poor
color
and
almost
no
mouth
the
head
seems
to
just
disappear
as
soon
as
it
was
poured
i
did
not
detect
any
wheat
aroma
at
all
and
wonder
if
they
used
any
wheat
malt
when
brewing
this
beer
very
light
very
little
hop
flavor
this
should
not
be
considered
an
ipa
by
any
means
pathetic
head
with
nonexistent
lacing
other
than
that
really
not
a
bad
beer
nice
color
easy
drinking
smooth
taste
if
they
could
add
some
more
carbonation
and
call
this
just
a
wheat
ale
instead
of
a
wheat
ipa
i
would
have
much
more
respect
for
this
brew
these
guys
know
about
carbonation
the
smell
is
not
very
inviting
flavors
are
muted
and
a
little
muddy
this
one
tastes
like
it
has
some
margarita
mix
in
it
not
sweet
however
not
malty
not
hoppy
its
just
a
beery
taste
with
some
earthy
murky
flavors
i
cant
actually
taste
anything
like
hops
but
it
does
have
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
is
far
from
pleasant
theres
really
nothing
to
hate
in
this
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
of
the
good
flavors
of
either
an
ipa
or
a
witbier
plenty
of
concept
though
purchased
only
one
bottle
and
that
was
enough
overall
very
disappointing
in
my
attempts
to
always
try
new
beers
i
decided
to
give
this
one
a
shot
despite
my
tendency
to
shy
away
from
shock
top
homebrewer
and
i
cant
reuse
their
twist
off
bottles
save
your
money
on
this
one
and
buy
something
else
serving
type
bottlepint
glass
o
i
wondered
why
this
was
listed
as
a
wheat
beer
and
not
an
ipa
my
first
drink
answered
that
question
it
tastes
like
blue
moon
put
an
orange
slice
in
it
and
that
is
what
you
have
there
are
no
discernible
ipa
characteristics
to
this
beer
its
just
a
below
average
wheat
beer
o
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
an
ipa
it
would
fare
better
in
the
wheat
ale
category
this
pours
a
cloudy
golden
copper
color
with
a
beige
head
the
scent
is
a
mild
aroma
of
wheat
and
hops
the
taste
is
not
really
a
wheat
beer
and
not
really
an
ipa
there
is
a
lot
more
of
a
mellow
citrus
taste
than
anything
the
taste
isnt
very
strong
and
the
texture
is
kind
of
weak
this
is
probably
one
of
the
weaker
offerings
from
the
shocktop
line
the
whole
entire
character
of
the
beer
meets
the
nose
and
palate
halfway
then
just
drops
off
like
it
was
never
even
there
what
is
the
reason
for
such
a
lackluster
aftertaste
it
had
potential
perhaps
this
beer
is
what
differentiates
between
macros
and
what
is
going
on
deep
in
the
craft
beer
world
there
is
a
watereddown
honeysuckle
taste
with
heavy
citrus
overtones
the
hops
are
present
but
do
not
introduce
themselves
this
is
the
anheuserbusch
of
ipas
with
a
citruswheat
twist
i
enjoy
pounding
these
because
they
dont
have
a
heavy
or
pronounced
flavor
but
make
us
hoplovers
laugh
in
a
hey
this
aint
too
terrible
sorta
way
this
is
why
i
like
this
beer
poured
from
tap
into
pint
at
bww
shreveport
pours
a
slight
amber
with
about
2
fingers
of
head
looks
nice
but
too
dark
for
a
pale
wheat
faint
corny
citrus
aroma
with
some
slight
faint
wheaty
notes
super
mild
citrus
flavor
meets
a
bit
of
wheat
malts
but
also
has
a
bit
of
astringent
cleaner
like
flavor
but
its
very
mild
its
really
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
i
will
most
likely
never
have
another
pours
sort
of
a
cloudy
dark
tan
with
a
very
light
head
it
says
on
the
bottle
to
pour
until
a
half
inch
is
left
in
bottle
swirl
that
around
and
pour
to
produce
a
rich
thick
collar
of
foam
to
release
citrusy
cascade
hop
aroma
i
did
this
but
there
wasnt
very
much
of
a
thick
head
it
has
a
very
faint
citrus
smell
certainly
nothing
offensive
but
not
overwhelming
either
taste
is
average
like
the
smell
not
offensive
and
certainly
drinkable
but
not
great
either
it
is
probably
something
that
you
could
drink
a
couple
of
might
quench
your
thirst
but
wouldnt
ever
hit
you
where
you
stop
and
say
damn
that
is
good
that
citrus
taste
has
that
hoppy
ipa
kick
at
the
end
but
is
less
encouraging
then
other
better
ipa
mouthfeel
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
texture
or
anything
going
on
a
non
offensive
tolerable
beer
that
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
wont
kill
you
either
o
real
disappointed
i
think
that
shock
top
belgian
white
is
a
decent
wheat
beer
and
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
not
a
very
good
attempt
from
anheuser
busch
here
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
several
better
wheat
beers
several
better
ipas
and
several
beers
that
do
a
much
better
job
of
combining
the
two
styles
that
i
would
choose
before
this
one
overall
ipa
what
a
joke
ive
had
brown
ales
with
more
hop
character
than
this
just
another
beer
trying
to
cash
in
on
the
ipa
trend
this
is
the
last
of
the
shock
top
im
ever
trying
i
cant
do
this
to
myself
anymore
i
expect
them
to
be
bad
and
theyre
even
worse
than
the
already
low
expectations
i
have
for
them
overall
drinkability
easily
shock
tops
best
spinoff
id
suggest
passing
this
up
i
had
this
after
ordered
this
simply
because
i
had
never
tried
it
before
needless
to
say
it
left
me
regretting
this
decision
when
the
bar
had
better
ipas
in
bottles
for
a
wheat
ipa
it
really
lacked
that
hoppy
goodness
i
look
for
in
both
taste
and
smell
it
was
a
decent
refreshing
beer
but
i
wont
be
buying
another
overall
this
is
an
underrated
american
gasstation
beer
you
all
want
it
to
be
something
that
its
not
and
its
saying
no

i
dont
really
taste
any
additional
hops
it
doesnt
taste
that
much
different
than
a
regular
wheat
to
me

5grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
with
minimal
expectations
of
how
it
might
be
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
decent
looking
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
looking
white
head
on
top
the
aroma
didnt
give
off
too
much
in
the
way
of
hops
in
my
opinion
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
honestly
just
not
good
at
all
to
me
i
found
it
to
be
weak
and
the
hops
that
i
was
tasting
were
awful
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
moderately
carbonated
overall
i
just
found
the
taste
of
this
to
be
unpleasant
on
every
level
just
a
poor
attempt
at
getting
this
beer
off
the
ground
i
think
ill
keep
this
one
on
the
shelves

first
calling
this
an
ipa
is
very
deceptive
and
wrong
however
the
wheat
flavors
are
there
and
for
the
price
its
not
half
bad
i
do
think
the
wheat
beers
from
michelob
are
betterjsh420feb

strong
citrus
smell
and
aftertaste
my
least
favorite
of
revolver
taster
at
uncle
bucks
in
grapevine
wondeful
beer
very
drinkable
especially
if
you
can
find
it
on
tap
very
very
very
very
good
awesome
beer
need
more
in
kentucky
very
nice
wheat
color
and
the
blood
orange
gives
it
a
hint
of
a
tart
aftertaste
poured
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
with
lots
of
sediment
floating
nice
spicy
and
citrus
flavor
clean
finish
and
it
hides
the
7
very
well
paired
well
with
bbq
but
was
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
the
beer
poured
an
opaque
orange
to
straw
yellow
with
a
lot
of
sediment
i
poured
about
34
of
it
in
my
glass
activated
the
yeast
and
poured
the
rest
the
aroma
was
sweet
and
spicy
with
hints
of
cloves
and
orange
i
may
have
detected
a
bit
of
honey
in
the
sweet
but
it
could
have
been
my
mind
making
me
taste
it
due
to
the
name
the
taste
was
full
of
the
same
spice
and
orange
all
riding
the
honey
sweet
body
it
was
not
like
honey
nut
cheerios
sweet
but
rather
a
good
full
beer
sweetness
the
orange
and
spice
fully
emerge
as
the
beer
warmed
and
even
gave
the
blood
and
honey
a
bit
of
tartness
i
could
also
detect
the
base
wheat
beer
flavors
of
clove
and
bananas
underneath
the
orange
the
full
bodied
brew
offered
a
wonderful
take
on
a
standard
wheat
beer
i
love
blood
oranges
and
the
blood
and
honey
highlights
those
flavors
a
winner
in
my
book
normally
i
do
not
like
fruit
in
my
beer
but
this
one
is
surprisingly
good
and
refreshing
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
and
citrus
not
a
fan
of
how
this
tastes
which
is
like
some
kind
of
artichoke
dip
not
the
flavor
i
want
in
a
beer
such
brew
many
abv
yes
another
bottle
that
travelled
to
me
from
texas
thru
my
sons
generous
efforts
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
foamy
white
head
with
excellent
lacing
the
smell
of
oranges
and
honey
is
enticing
a
cloudy
yellow
orange
color
with
a
bit
of
sediment
apparent
which
is
natural
for
an
unfiltered
beer
tasting
it
there
is
a
definite
honey
and
orange
sweetness
that
was
wellbalanced
and
simply
deeelicious
i
wish
i
had
more
than
one
of
these
the
blood
orange
and
spice
flavor
countered
with
medium
honey
sweetness
interesting
combo
overall
i
dont
like
solid
bits
in
my
beer
im
going
to
pour
this
out
the
flavor
isnt
too
bad
and
i
really
like
the
concept
but
theres
not
enough
here
to
make
me
want
to
drink
this
i
really
hope
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
light
but
a
good
bitter
for
a
wheat
maybe
its
just
the
pour
i
got
but
it
tastes
a
bit
salty
had
a
bottle
of
this
in
weatherford
texas
as
we
were
doing
a
nc
to
az
road
trip
nice
smell
and
lace
the
blood
oranges
worked
love
this
beer
an
american
wheat
with
a
nice
citrus
taste
one
of
my
favorite
craft
beers
around
its
something
to
try
im
not
sure
if
id
seek
it
again
but
yes
id
take
it
cold
if
offered
always
better
on
tap
revolver
brewery
is
located
about
five
minutes
from
my
house
and
i
tried
this
beer
when
they
first
opened
their
doors
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
stands
out
to
a
lot
of
people
and
some
people
just
dont
like
it
however
it
think
it
adds
a
nice
refreshing
quality
to
the
beer
and
its
something
i
could
enjoy
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
no
problems
and
ive
done
it
at
their
location
this
is
their
most
popular
beer
by
far
and
its
the
one
that
they
are
bottling
currently
too
theyre
still
a
small
operation
as
far
as
breweries
are
concerned
but
they
have
been
growing
very
quickly
serving
from
bottle
you
can
see
the
yeast
through
the
bottle
actually
looks
very
tastey
just
looking
at
it
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
foamy
head
smells
of
citrus
notes
not
overpowering
taste
is
sweet
lemon
orange
a
slight
boozyness
finishes
sharp
very
refreshing
drinkable
and
unique
this
is
a
very
pale
strawcolored
beer
with
a
small
head
that
fades
pretty
quickly
the
nose
is
excellent
with
a
sweet
light
maltiness
lots
of
wheat
and
tart
citrus
peel
notes
the
latter
very
witlike
the
taste
is
interesting
and
unique
the
malt
is
much
more
prominent
than
i
expectedits
even
a
little
heady
citrus
isnt
as
prominent
as
in
the
nose
but
its
still
detectable
there
is
some
subtle
not
really
identifiable
spiciness
perhaps
from
the
yeast
used
very
good
beer
the
beer
that
pulled
me
into
the
craft
brew
world
and
my
favorite
beer
from
revolver
brewing
co
perfect
summer
time
beer
paired
pretty
damn
well
with
fried
shrimp
and
fried
alligator
bites
scored
this
as
an
extra
in
a
deal
thanks
gregh
poured
into
a
pokal
glass
produced
a
thin
12
head
which
dissipated
fairly
quickly
a
i
love
the
appearance
of
an
unfiltered
wheat
hazy
and
golden
in
the
glass
s
you
can
really
smell
the
spice
and
the
honey
from
the
glass
t
nice
and
light
get
the
spice
and
hint
of
orange
off
the
nose
with
a
clean
finish
reminds
me
of
a
more
flavorful
oberon
no
hint
of
booze
really
well
blended
also
with
a
light
and
refreshing
mouth
feel
overall
i
am
really
impressed
with
this
beer
being
from
chicago
id
never
even
heard
of
it
before
i
would
say
its
one
of
my
new
favorites
of
the
style
great
summer
beer
this
was
a
little
bit
oddball
but
still
very
tasty
and
one
of
the
more
unique
wheat
beers
ive
had
pours
a
nice
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
lots
of
dark
bits
and
pieces
smells
terrific
smells
very
sweet
fresh
and
citrusy
however
theres
no
sweetness
in
the
taste
a
very
lively
clean
and
refreshing
beer
really
enjoyed
this
one
im
a
fan
and
i
bet
at
any
barbecue
this
would
be
a
huge
hit
it
is
bottled
and
distributed
here
locally
and
worth
the
extra
dollar
for
this
great
tasting
beer
between
the
bottled
and
on
tap
prefer
on
tap
of
course
but
the
beer
bottled
up
tastes
just
as
good
any
given
saturday
when
you
can
take
the
trip
out
to
the
brewery
to
enjoy
some
music
local
food
horse
shoes
and
great
tasting
beer
this
is
almost
like
a
strong
belgian
wit
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
hope
my
store
keeps
this
in
stock
onice
blend
of
flavors
enjoyable
drinking
summary
good
brew
pretty
unique
maybe
a
little
heavy
on
the
oj
but
still
tasty
would
drink
it
again
atmosphere
is
really
good
opaque
golden
hue
thick
persistent
frothy
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
bready
with
fall
spice
and
some
citrus
thick
and
syrupy
wheat
accentuated
with
citrus
rind
and
cinnamon
spice
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
a
great
beer
a
year
round
drinker
and
favorite
o
a
lot
of
hype
locally
over
the
release
of
this
beer
in
bottles
certainly
lived
up
to
the
hype
strikes
me
as
a
great
summertime
beer
the
rest
is
a
showcase
in
how
an
experienced
hand
crafts
a
beer
subtle
flavor
additions
wellbalanced
and
wellblended
flavors
in
the
nose
touches
of
citrus
peel
blend
with
honey
to
give
the
brew
a
smooth
creamsicly
aroma
the
flavor
has
the
same
aspect
though
more
pronounced
wheat
here
adds
notes
of
banana
and
apple
before
a
lingering
finish
of
earthy
honey
this
along
with
a
pillowy
medium
body
and
mild
carbonation
make
blood
and
honey
eminently
drinkable
o
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
the
complexity
of
the
taste
really
had
me
surprised
i
was
used
to
writing
off
all
wheat
beers
as
generally
tasting
the
same
really
glad
that
i
have
access
to
this
as
it
is
one
that
my
wife
and
i
can
both
share
looking
forward
to
drinking
lots
more
this
summer
lots
of
honey
and
blood
orange
in
the
nose
and
the
palate
well
balanced
and
drinkable
with
a
solid
mouth
feel
for
style
all
in
all
a
great
offering
from
revolver
o
greatly
enjoyed
always
dig
bubblegummy
beer
enjoyed
on
tap
at
osdh
in
denton
overall
i
was
impressed
and
will
have
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
body
the
smell
is
sweet
with
blood
orange
and
honey
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
taste
but
i
also
get
a
nice
wheat
flavor
the
beer
tingles
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
goes
down
easy
this
is
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
had
on
tap
at
the
common
table
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
orange
citrus
notes
as
well
as
some
wheat
the
flavor
is
more
complex
i
get
some
great
wheat
and
honey
notes
as
well
as
some
herbs
and
juicy
citrus
as
i
drink
the
beer
the
herbal
notes
get
stronger
and
stronger
and
add
more
and
more
to
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
this
actually
surprised
me
the
lemon
smell
is
right
off
the
bat
and
you
can
really
taste
it
in
the
flavor
as
well
i
really
like
the
lemon
flavor
in
a
summer
beer
and
this
does
not
disappoint
this
is
just
a
solid
beer
and
doesnt
try
to
do
too
much
and
knows
what
it
is
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
small
white
head
barely
perceptible
light
grain
aroma
taste
begins
with
some
honey
sweetness
then
a
hawaiian
bread
middle
and
a
lightly
earthy
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
carbonation
overall
a
decent
beer
though
a
little
bit
bland
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
originally
reviewed
09062011
more
sweet
touch
of
corn
touch
of
wheat
lemon
on
the
first
sip
just
too
much
of
the
honeysweetness
thing
for
me
to
really
get
behind
this
beer
they
should
bulk
up
the
wheat
to
offset
this
not
a
horrible
beer
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
feed
these
to
unsuspecting
women
in
the
summer
o
great
improvement
coming
from
blue
moon
while
the
beer
is
good
it
wont
have
that
lasting
appeal
other
apas
have
overall
not
a
great
beer
by
a
long
shot
but
far
from
a
drainpour
i
can
think
of
worse
things
to
be
offered
at
a
summer
barbecuetype
setting
the
drinkability
is
relatively
high
although
it
lacks
in
the
nose
and
taste
its
not
terrible
its
a
pleasant
enough
sessionable
beer
barbeque
worthy
if
nothing
else
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
and
wheat
with
some
grass
from
the
hops
mixed
in
i
dont
get
any
honey
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
somewhat
bland
i
get
a
lot
of
wheat
notes
as
well
as
quite
a
bit
of
sugar
possibly
from
the
honey
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
a
honey
flavor
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
here
the
honey
addition
really
makes
this
otherwise
normal
pale
wheat
ale
something
really
special
and
they
did
it
perfectly
overall
worth
a
shot
okay
beer
but
in
my
opinion
blue
moons
original
witbier
and
winter
offering
are
much
better
heck
i
would
even
take
a
harvest
moon
over
this
i
would
recommend
this
to
the
bmc
drinker
who
wanted
something
a
bit
craftier
this
beer
pours
out
a
little
on
the
clear
side
the
head
comes
and
goes
not
leaving
much
behind
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
malts
and
some
wheat
the
taste
is
pretty
light
and
has
a
slight
honey
sweetness
to
it
there
is
a
hint
of
yeast
in
there
too
but
not
much
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
clean
and
smooth
a
bit
too
light
overall
for
me
would
have
liked
something
a
little
more
flavorful
overall
honey
moon
or
whatever
the
names
been
changed
to
is
average
at
best
ive
had
other
blue
moon
seasonals
that
i
believe
were
better
but
id
still
take
this
over
any
of
the
coors
line
up
its
a
nice
light
easy
drinking
beer
for
the
summer
season
have
one
while
grilling
or
mowing
the
lawn
but
if
youre
looking
for
more
taste
look
elsewhere
mouth
feel
is
light
and
thin
making
this
brew
easy
drinking
its
an
original
concept
but
doesnt
offer
anything
all
that
great
im
growing
tired
of
all
these
pseudocraft
bmc
endeavors
leave
the
brewing
to
the
real
craftsmen
and
go
back
to
your
chemistry
experiments
a
nice
summer
thirst
quencher
light
gold
with
a
fast
fading
head
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smell
is
light
wheat
malt
and
lemony
citrus
nice
clean
taste
with
sweet
wheat
malt
orangey
citrus
notes
a
bit
of
mild
hops
leading
to
a
smooth
honeyed
finish
some
spices
as
well
medium
weight
with
a
mild
effervescence
goes
down
quite
nicely
a
solid
brew
for
the
grilling
season
d
overall
it
isnt
really
anything
special
i
wouldve
liked
to
see
more
input
from
honey
attributes
drinking
this
during
vacation
and
on
the
beach
even
then
not
all
that
appealing
luckily
i
have
plenty
of
sweetwater
and
palmetto
to
get
me
through
not
something
i
would
recommend
and
even
a
week
offering
for
a
blue
moon
beer
first
off
i
never
got
the
chance
to
try
full
moon
honey
moon
or
the
rising
moon
therefor
i
cannot
compare
the
two
however
i
have
heard
from
beer
drinkers
that
the
honey
moon
was
quite
nice
and
not
bad
for
a
coors
product
i
wasnt
too
excited
about
the
recipe
change
the
winter
abbey
was
okay
the
spring
blonde
was
okay
and
im
anxious
to
try
the
new
harvest
moon
this
one
on
the
other
hand
has
some
hope
i
do
not
like
wheat
in
beer
especially
hefs
belgian
whites
are
okay
for
the
most
part
but
never
hit
it
out
of
the
park
this
one
didnt
do
that
either
but
it
still
was
tasty
it
has
lots
of
sweet
honey
flavor
that
goes
pretty
well
with
the
wheat
and
citrus
only
problem
is
that
its
kinda
flat
thats
what
shock
top
has
that
blue
moon
doesnt
the
carbonation
it
just
seems
right
with
st
you
look
at
original
wits
like
hoegaarden
theyre
all
super
crisp
they
all
have
sediment
it
just
feels
right
i
hope
blue
moon
can
do
a
decent
job
on
the
fall
brew
go
pick
this
one
up
its
very
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
stay
thirsty
my
friends
odi
truly
dont
mind
normal
blue
moon
this
one
along
with
the
spring
seasonal
are
the
only
two
i
have
tried
both
were
not
very
good
o
not
necessarily
a
beer
i
would
have
seeked
out
but
enjoyed
it
not
overly
complex
but
something
that
would
be
good
to
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
o
if
its
the
only
thing
to
drink
dont
fear
it
doesnt
taste
bad
thats
the
only
good
thing
you
can
say
as
on
all
other
accounts
its
a
failure
d
not
very
good
i
will
say
that
i
dont
actively
dislike
regular
blue
moon
but
from
what
i
have
experienced
their
seasonals
really
do
suck
epically
the
malt
is
thin
and
somehow
manages
to
taste
strange
and
kind
of
artificial
this
was
one
of
the
few
truly
drain
pour
worthy
beers
that
i
have
ever
encountered
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
terribly
complicated
its
a
good
mix
and
makes
for
a
good
general
drinking
beer
a
disappointment
most
blue
moon
brews
are
not
halfbad
at
best
and
at
least
drinkable
at
their
worst
this
beer
is
the
latter
overly
sweet
adjuncty
and
just
not
very
good
well
for
starters
the
appearance
of
this
is
awful
it
looks
like
an
average
macro
lager
it
is
completely
yellow
and
it
only
is
cloudy
in
certain
areas
most
of
it
is
completely
see
through
which
is
not
acceptable
from
a
wheat
beer
the
head
disappears
in
seconds
and
leaves
very
little
lacing
overall
im
not
pleased
with
the
appearance
on
this
the
smell
is
very
small
i
get
a
little
honey
and
a
little
bit
of
that
macro
lager
smell
maybe
even
some
corn
in
there
not
too
great
on
the
smell
the
only
reason
the
smell
isnt
a
2
5
also
is
because
its
a
step
up
from
a
macro
lager
the
appearance
is
exactly
like
a
macro
lager
where
as
the
smell
is
a
small
step
up
i
get
very
little
honey
on
this
beer
and
i
get
mostly
generic
beer
taste
there
is
a
little
honey
which
makes
it
nice
to
drink
but
mostly
its
not
the
most
amazing
taste
ever
its
not
a
god
awful
taste
but
it
really
just
tastes
like
a
macro
with
honey
in
it
so
how
can
i
like
that
it
is
refreshing
and
light
so
its
easy
to
drink
but
other
than
that
there
arent
too
many
redeeming
factors
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
crappy
for
a
wheat
ale
overall
a
pretty
average
perhaps
below
average

a

this
is
the
beer
you
can
drink
all
day
all
spring
and
all
summer
enjoy
it
nice
and
cold
not
an
a
beer
but
in
its
category
it
sure
is
a
sweet
light
flavored
and
light
bodied
beer
intended
to
be
served
cold
on
hot
days
this
beer
holds
up
better
than
some
other
summer
beers
to
warming
some
malt
and
wheat
flavor
lingers
into
the
finish
along
with
a
modicum
of
light
orange
flavor
each
mouthful
takes
me
to
a
black
sandy
beach
in
fiji
this
goes
perfect
with
a
higher
end
cigar
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thick
rocky
white
head
that
sticks
around
awhile
and
some
lacing
smells
of
wheat
gluten
and
some
sweetness
and
maybe
some
orange
peel
taste
is
terrible
bitterness
blended
with
sparkling
water
terrible
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
drinkability
is
poor
because
flavor
is
terrible
honey
moon
is
an
average
summer
brew
however
i
much
prefer
blue
moon
belgian
white
honey
moonhas
a
light
straw
colour
and
a
decent
head
that
lasts
about
a
minute
but
always
maintains
lacing
this
beer
smells
like
wet
barn
straw
there
isnt
much
flavour
to
begin
with
but
the
honey
really
comes
through
in
the
aftertaste
its
a
pleasant
and
extremely
drinkable
beer
d
session
if
you
were
in
the
mood
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
newly
popular
blue
moon
or
its
belgian
but
this
is
nice
stuff
might
be
nice
with
some
donuts
or
chocolate
blue
moons
summer
seasonal
is
a
clear
amber
wheat
ale
brewed
with
clover
honey
and
orange
peel
for
added
zing
the
flavor
is
overwhelmingly
sweet
and
heavy
on
the
honey
though
honey
moon
feels
lighter
and
less
filling
than
the
signature
blue
moon
so
its
a
better
fit
for
those
steamy
summer
days
pretty
tasty
stuff
not
too
complex
but
refreshing
just
the
same
hey
blue
moon
lets
just
be
friends
this
is
a
better
than
average
summer
beer
it
smells
and
tastes
like
honey
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
lemon
it
is
sweet
without
being
too
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
heavy
for
a
summer
beer
i
would
like
it
better
if
it
was
a
little
lighter
it
is
easy
to
drink
a
couple
of
these
the
yellow
bottle
and
honey
title
should
let
you
know
whats
going
on
and
it
isnt
wonderful
tho
it
is
technically
sweet
it
feels
alright
smells
alright
and
drinks
alright
so
thats
passable
for
a
seasonable
although
it
doesnt
come
close
to
making
me
feel
relaxed
and
summery
this
beer
cuts
corners
to
preserve
the
honey
which
is
lame
overall
not
a
good
showing
from
bm
a
shame
since
their
regular
blue
moon
is
tasty
on
tap
even
though
its
made
by
one
of
the
big
guys
they
should
scrap
the
seasonals
conclusion
if
i
get
drug
along
to
a
place
where
all
they
have
is
generic
lagers
and
perhaps
a
blue
moon
on
tap
ill
take
a
blue
moon
if
im
in
a
beer
mood
especially
on
draft
it
can
kinda
hit
the
spot
no
im
not
a
bmc
guy
but
i
have
no
problem
admitting
that
if
its
not
old
or
served
with
dirty
lines
a
blue
moon
is
sometimes
just
damn
tasty
esp
if
served
in
a
black
n
tan
fashion
wguinness
their
seasonals
however
should
be
avoided
this
is
the
best
one
of
em
but
thats
not
saying
much
drinkability
this
tastes
like
a
bad
pilsner
mixed
with
honey
i
appreciate
blue
moon
but
this
beer
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
the
sweetness
is
borderline
cloying
at
times
and
does
not
mix
well
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
blue
moon
this
summer
ale
is
quite
good
a
nice
muddled
sweetness
makes
this
beer
an
adequately
drinkable
summer
quaffer
given
its
ubiquity
stateside
at
least
and
price
point
thin
head
disapeared
quickly
not
much
of
anything
to
smell
nice
color
very
slight
honey
flavor
even
less
citrus
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
exceptional
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
forget
about
because
it
is
right
in
the
middle
not
good
not
bad
its
just
there
its
a
blue
suit
a
plain
tshirt
a
romantic
comedy
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
new
pint
glass
from
barefoot
bernies
in
obx
nc
thin
wispy
head
only
lasted
a
few
seconds
then
dissipated
into
nothing
smell
was
bright
and
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
coming
through
due
to
the
honey
taste
was
somewhat
bland
with
the
macro
wheat
taste
and
a
bit
of
honey
somewhat
sweet
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
drinkability
was
good
would
be
good
to
have
a
few
by
the
pool
but
not
really
something
a
beer
advocate
would
drink
routinely
although
not
technically
a
light
beer
this
summer
ale
has
a
light
taste
and
feel
to
it
it
is
seasoned
with
just
a
hint
of
both
citrus
and
honey
giving
it
a
bit
of
a
lemonadey
quality
the
head
is
light
and
frothy
and
fades
fast
overall
its
fairly
insubstantial
but
its
the
kind
of
beer
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
great
not
bad
bottle
poured
a
light
golden
color
ale
with
a
small
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
light
wheat
malt
with
notes
of
orange
peel
and
honey
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
wheat
malt
with
notes
of
orange
peel
and
honey
overall
this
is
quite
bland
with
a
limited
flavour
profile
one
was
enough
for
me
as
for
summer
ales
ive
had
better
that
being
said
this
isnt
all
that
bad
a
brew
for
a
big
box
brand
i
will
say
it
was
a
decent
try
on
behalf
of
the
brewery
while
not
as
heavy
as
its
older
brother
blue
moon
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
leaves
a
wonderful
after
taste
its
very
smooth
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
the
coloring
isnt
as
deep
but
its
quite
lovely
i
highly
recommend
it
drinkability
3
5
out
of
5
its
pretty
good
for
a
summer
beer
but
that
doesnt
really
change
the
fact
that
its
a
bit
onedimensional
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
not
for
the
taste
just
because
they
go
down
easily
the
honey
would
be
more
fitting
in
a
heavier
fall
wheat
beer
drinkability
is
good
especially
for
a
summer
afternoon
barbeque
d
for
a
macro
beer
its
not
too
shabby
the
lingering
sweetness
prevent
this
beer
from
crushing
the
drinkability
category
drinkability
is
okay
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
totally
uninspiring
and
utterly
forgettable
d
yeah
good
thing
i
only
drank
a
little
no
sense
wasting
another
sip
in
my
lifetime
on
this
crap
clear
gold
with
no
head
at
least
after
the
initial
cap
of
white
foam
disappeared
within
about
30
seconds
light
aroma
oranges
honey
wheat
crackers
lightly
floral
more
of
same
in
the
flavour
sweet
oranges
wheat
honey
sweetness
bitterness
was
mild
and
it
was
a
little
acrid
and
spicy
in
the
finish
light
bodied
coarse
carbonation
overall
its
pretty
average
nothing
is
terribly
wrong
it
just
didnt
come
together
very
well
d
goes
down
easy
but
the
honey
becomes
unappealing
about
half
way
through
the
bottle
i
really
dont
think
i
could
drink
another
one
of
these
it
had
a
12
inch
head
that
dissaptes
quickly
no
lace
left
it
had
a
little
carbanation
i
taste
a
little
honey
and
some
light
citrus
flavor
it
has
a
great
mouth
feel
i
think
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
nice
for
the
summer
the
beer
is
light
but
isnt
a
light
beer
i
just
want
a
summer
beer
that
excites
my
palate
this
like
so
many
others
falls
short
theres
nothing
bad
tasting
here
just
a
light
honey
flavor
id
drink
this
at
a
bbq
over
a
macro
lager
but
otherwise
id
steer
clear
drinkability
drinkability
is
good
over
5
abv
which
is
nice
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
didnt
get
sick
of
this
beer
drinkability
honestly
quite
so
this
is
very
refreshing
and
a
change
of
pace
from
all
the
high
alcohol
and
massively
flavorful
beers
i
am
used
to
it
is
nice
every
now
and
then
to
have
something
that
is
just
plain
and
simple
not
the
best
not
the
worst
but
definitely
drinkable
poured
into
10oz
glass
poured
a
clean
clear
urine
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
had
no
retention
or
lacing
the
smell
was
ok
a
very
slight
grainy
wheat
aroma
no
other
notable
features
the
flavor
was
a
slightly
funky
wheat
taste
again
nothing
else
stands
out
the
body
was
thin
and
watery
drinkability
wasnt
terrible
but
also
wasnt
very
good
overall
an
unspectacular
beer
which
is
pretty
much
what
i
was
expecting
honey
moon
is
similar
to
other
summer
season
beers
ive
had
the
beer
is
shade
of
yellow
that
is
a
bit
cloudy
the
taste
and
smell
is
fairly
sweet
there
is
definetly
some
citrus
flavor
in
this
beer
i
would
say
this
beer
is
comparable
to
sam
adams
summer
ale
but
i
found
honey
moon
to
be
a
bit
sweeter
honey
moon
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
summer
beers
drinkability
meh
regular
blue
moon
is
better
than
this
while
its
a
good
summer
seasonal
i
cant
see
myself
going
out
and
buying
this
close
to
two
fingers
of
pure
white
microfoam
rapid
dissolve
down
to
the
surface
with
only
trace
lacing
left
behind
basic
yelloworange
color
quite
clear
with
minimal
scattered
bubbles
visible
within
the
nose
is
based
mainly
on
grains
wheat
rye
with
rice
and
corn
too
the
honey
makes
itself
quietly
present
same
for
the
orange
citrus
neither
would
seem
a
focal
point
where
they
not
mentioned
on
the
label
light
brush
of
apricot
fruit
too
mediumbodied
fairly
smooth
even
as
the
carbonations
activity
increases
mouth
presence
the
honey
here
tempers
any
herbaceous
or
grassy
elements
the
citrus
remains
lowkey
more
blossom
than
pulp
or
juice
nothing
notable
about
the
malts
again
the
graininess
adds
punctuation
without
much
personality
innocuous
easy
to
see
why
a
casual
drinker
might
order
a
bottle
d
well
this
was
unexpected
in
an
off
style
sorta
way
its
not
bad
and
certainly
drinkable
i
could
easily
polish
off
a
sixer
i
just
didnt
like
how
the
beer
has
been
filtered
of
its
yeasty
goodness
and
it
looks
like
a
cheap
adjunct
lager
thats
been
left
out
over
night
i
think
id
rather
stick
with
a
pack
of
schlitz
over
this
it
least
it
would
be
a
better
deal
drinkable
and
mildly
refreshing
there
are
many
better
options
for
pale
wheat
ales
out
there
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
half
inch
of
head
head
that
didnt
hang
around
long
it
is
yellow
in
color
it
smells
very
sweet
im
imagining
that
it
is
the
honey
the
taste
is
not
refreshing
there
really
isnt
much
taste
i
get
just
a
slight
wheat
taste
and
thats
about
it
im
not
a
fan
of
blue
moon
in
any
case
with
a
gun
to
my
head
i
would
choose
rising
moon
they
just
make
some
crappy
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
present
after
drinking
some
the
aroma
is
very
faint
but
there
are
hints
of
a
sweet
malt
backbone
along
with
some
honey
the
taste
has
a
sweet
malt
backbone
with
a
nice
honey
flavor
over
the
top
the
taste
is
of
honey
is
dominate
it
is
a
surprisingly
very
nice
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
the
honey
flavor
was
nice
and
appealing
however
very
non
complex
i
could
see
the
honey
flavor
getting
maybe
old
or
boring
after
a
couple
all
told
this
is
a
pretty
pleasant
beer
for
me
its
nice
to
pick
up

because
it
is
a
beer
that
i
can
share
with
the
wife
its
sweet
characteristics
and
easy
drinking
appealing
to
her
it
is
a
great
compromise
beer
in
that
it
isnt
a
complex
tripel
or
bw
but
it
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
that
appeals
to
me
and
the
wiv
i
love
the
classic
blue
moon
so
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
better
it
wasnt
terrible
but
it
wasnt
great
either
it
was
just
average
i
found
that
the
orange
peel
and
the
honey
didnt
mix
well
together
canceling
each
other
out
and
leaving
the
tastes
too
subtle
honey
goes
better
with
a
darker
brew
like
a
brown
ale
which
adds
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
ease
the
bitterness
blue
moon
is
already
a
sweet
light
flavorful
beer
and
adding
honey
to
it
just
doesnt
make
sense
ill
stick
to
the
original
from
now
on
but
hey
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
now
i
know
d
say
what
you
will
about
coors
or
blue
moon
but
this
one
actually
isnt
too
terrible
i
dont
know
if
id
really
buy
this
but
there
are
certainly
worse
beers
this
beer
does
go
down
easy
and
is
great
for
any
bbq
i
couldnt
really
handle
more
than
three
of
these
in
a
row
its
very
lightly
carbonated
which
added
to
the
ease
of
drinking
it
i
think
a
little
less
honey
and
a
little
more
wheat
could
go
a
long
way
with
this
one
not
bad
but
certainly
not
great
stick
to
regular
blue
moon
d
thought
this
was
an
easy
drinker
at
first
but
became
so
sweet
i
started
having
trouble
with
the
12
oz
bottle
light
mouthfeel
moderate
carbonation
leaves
for
a
refreshing
effervescent
feel
on
the
palate
this
combined
with
the
honey
notes
at
the
end
saves
this
beer
from
being
a
disappointment
wish
i
had
it
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
so
i
could
try
something
new
instead
of
having
another
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
another
d
goes
down
smooth
i
would
have
another
esp
on
a
hot
summer
day
served
from
bottle
into
imperial
pint
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
onefinger
white
head
that
quickly
subsides
there
was
no
lacing
apparent
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
a
musty
note
with
some
citrus
the
flavor
was
very
bland
with
hints
of
citrus
and
wheat
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
they
would
most
likely
need
to
start
from
scratch
in
order
to
salvage
this
beer
however
it
is
quite
refreshing
if
that
counts
for
anything
md
light
very
light
bodied
and
good
drinkability
d
not
an
enjoyable
brew
for
me
too
sweet
and
sugary
to
be
thirst
quenching
and
would
probably
make
me
feel
like
shit
if
i
chugged
one
on
a
hot
day
similarities
to
coors
light
in
every
category
lead
me
to
this
conclusion
master
brewers
in
golden
colorado
high
in
the
rocky
mountains
where
trains
fly
and
chicks
ski
in
bikinis
found
themselves
with
an
overabundance
of
clover
honey
due
global
warming
and
the
invasion
of
africanized
honeybees
rocky
mountain
scientists
discovered
that
killer
bees
can
only
be
killed
by
you
guessed
it
a
silver
bullet
not
wanting
the
sugary
gold
to
be
wasted
it
was
loaded
onto
a
flying
train
and
transported
back
to
the
brewery
the
formula
is
as
follows
9
parts
coors
light
2
parts
blue
moon
belgian
white
ale
1part
clover
honey
stir
vigorously
and
the
code
has
been
broken
tasted
a
lot
like
blue
moons
regular
brew
it
had
a
lot
more
citrus
but
i
guess
they
left
the
honey
out
of
my
six
pack
because
i
was
hoping
for
a
touch
more
sweetness
in
this
brew
i
drank
the
six
pack
in
a
week
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
and
i
wouldnt
pay
premium
dollars
for
it
either
honey
moon
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
good
sized
head
the
smell
had
some
citrus
and
orange
but
wasnt
strong
enough
it
tasted
similar
to
regular
blue
moon
but
stronger
and
with
a
lemon
and
honey
twist
to
it
it
was
light
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
might
be
the
best
blue
moon
not
the
best
seasonal
summer
beer
but
deffently
a
good
one
d
this
is
my
final
season
ale
of
the
blue
moon
family
and
while
none
of
them
ever
really
topped
blue
moon
in
overall
flavor
this
one
is
fairly
close
and
great
for
a
refreshing
alternative
i
will
have
again
on
further
review
the
honey
in
this
brew
is
overpowering
and
not
good
d
this
isnt
offensive
by
any
stretch
but
its
also
unimaginative
and
bland
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
a
side
note
my
wife
luved
this
one
she
is
not
a
beer
drinker
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
syrupy
feel
from
too
much
honey
kept
me
from
rating
it
higher
shines
a
bright
sunny
yellow
color
slightly
hazy
despite
its
brightness
there
is
a
thin
film
of
lace
to
be
seen
it
looks
very
light
has
the
slight
smell
of
lemon
and
a
touch
of
honey
has
a
wheat
smell
as
well
it
smells
like
a
cross
between
a
belgian
white
and
a
hefeweizen
not
very
strong
but
pleasant
enough
has
the
strong
taste
of
dry
wheat
with
a
top
layer
of
sweet
honey
witbier
taste
with
a
lil
somethin
extra
think
blue
moon
but
sweeter
thicker
than
then
regular
blue
moon
more
syrupy
but
also
has
a
saving
grace
of
some
dryness
to
offset
that
thickness
its
a
nice
enough
summery
drink
pours
very
clear
golden
yellow
head
doesnt
last
for
long
smell
is
very
clean
and
wheaty
taste
starts
off
citrusy
with
some
bitterness
blending
into
mineralness
and
then
finishing
with
honey
carbonated
well
enough
im
not
a
fan
of
honey
in
beer
but
its
understated
enough
here
as
not
to
detract
too
much
from
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
yet
after
a
while
the
stickiness
happens
decent
brew
i
could
sip
one
each
time
its
in
season
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
chewy
and
soft
in
the
finish
a
little
too
watery
needs
more
substance
to
it
d
fairly
drinkable
especially
if
its
warm
youre
drinking
from
the
bottle
youre
drinking
with
lots
of
people
andor
youre
used
to
lowerend
beer
this
blue
moon
is
closer
to
what
i
anticipate
from
coors
than
its
cousins
most
of
which
i
enjoy
i
wouldnt
recommend
honey
moon
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
advise
against
it
either
d
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
doesnt
compete
otherwise
sort
of
like
corona
hits
the
spot
when
youre
parched
but
not
the
beer
youd
bring
if
you
were
really
left
on
a
desert
island
decent
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
some
hints
of
honey
taste
is
sweet
honey
with
some
spices
fairly
good
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
great
d
for
a
witbier
it
is
just
about
decent
better
stuff
definitely
available
easily
but
since
i
am
a
big
witbier
fan
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
this
beer
is
very
solid
like
megalith
brewers
or
not
they
can
turn
out
solid
beers
from
time
to
time
it
comes
down
to
if
you
like
this
style
poured
a
modestly
cloudy
yellow
with
very
little
head
and
no
lace
the
smell
was
wheaty
with
very
little
else
except
for
the
faintest
hint
on
honey
and
lemon
the
flavor
did
have
more
honey
and
lemon
but
that
isnt
saying
much
the
mouthfeel
was
modestly
carbonated
and
fairly
thin
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
but
needs
much
more
flavor
drinkability
not
bad
its
not
the
best
wheat
ale
in
the
world
though
its
average
not
worth
seeking
out
but
a
slightly
better
option
than
regular
bmc
beer
im
surprised
they
charge
that
much
for
this
stuff
thumbs
down
never
again
d
ok
but
not
great
could
stand
to
be
a
lot
smoother
in
the
middle
the
beginning
and
end
were
decent
this
is
a
good
lightbodied
beer
with
plenty
of
kick
for
a
summer
ale
5
6
abv
if
you
can
get
past
the
color
you
can
drink
this
all
night
long
d
well
honeymoon
thankfully
isnt
the
worst
of
blue
moons
seasonals
its
actually
fairly
decent
for
what
it
is
a
nice
sweetish
beer
that
holds
up
well
on
a
hot
day
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
from
completely
slipping
down
into
the
depths
of
apwa
hell
other
comments
just
as
insipid
as
blue
moon
no
surprise
here
d
the
first
one
went
down
easy
enough
but
i
hesitate
to
have
a
second
for
fear
that
the
sweetness
would
become
too
cloying
d
another
no
thanks
ill
take
an
oberon
or
little
sumpin
sumpin
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
an
american
pale
wheat
i
really
thought
i
kinda
liked
this
beer
ill
try
it
again
and
i
should
vow
to
edit
this
if
ive
somehow
ruined
this
beer
with
refrigerator
lightis
that
possible
where
the
sweetness
aided
the
taste
it
hurts
the
drinkability
sugar
water
might
have
its
place
ridding
hiccups
perhaps
but
ill
try
someone
elses
before
i
consider
buying
this
one
again
honey
is
very
prevalent
in
the
flavor
and
adds
sweetness
to
the
beer
i
dont
really
taste
the
orange
peel
at
all
wheat
flavor
and
crispness
are
pushed
to
the
side
a
bit
and
seem
to
clash
with
the
floral
honey
flavors
the
beer
is
fairly
light
of
body
despite
the
residual
sweetness
this
brew
is
ok
but
i
dont
find
it
to
be
particularly
refreshing
and
only
mildly
enjoyable
poured
a
slight
dark
gold
w
onefinger
offwhite
head
and
thats
probably
the
best
attribute
of
the
beer
a
very
mild
smell
of
wheat
and
clove
with
hints
of
honey
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
this
beer
goes
down
real
easy
as
it
is
watery
the
honey
is
noticeable
for
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
but
this
beer
had
a
slightly
rough
edge
to
it
the
honey
and
wheat
do
not
necessarily
make
a
smooth
ride
one
of
those
beers
worth
trying
if
like
me
your
only
other
options
are
macros
and
this
is
temporarily
on
tap
seems
to
be
a
good
starter
beer
to
get
people
away
from
the
macros
though
this
is
a
millercoors
product
my
lager
drinking
friends
lager
being
any
beer
that
isnt
light
seem
to
enjoy
it
drinkability
its
low
abv
and
i
had
three
in
a
row
just
dusting
them
off
id
drink
it
again
if
i
was
in
need
of
a
sessioner
but
with
only
a
lack
of
other
options
summerfest
from
sn
was
much
much
more
satisfying
and
tends
to
be
equally
available
id
stick
with
that
honey
moon
wow
has
to
be
good
right
smells
like
a
kölsch
in
the
bottle
with
a
wheaty
background
and
some
spices
pours
to
a
clear
macro
but
slightly
orange
yellow
with
a
head
that
is
there
but
dont
blink
or
you
missed
it
taste
is
malty
with
a
trace
of
orange
spice
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
followed
by
a
syrupy
honey
center
and
a
tarty
slight
bitter
finish
the
honey
is
definitely
there
good
carbonation
smooth
but
doesnt
bite
kind
of
too
sweet
to
drink
very
much
of
needs
to
finish
dry
with
all
that
sweetness
this
would
be
a
dessert
beer
with
vanilla
ice
cream
more
than
a
sessioner
apropriately
named
d
a
bit
cloying
bland
and
wimpy
for
my
tastes
aside
from
the
prominence
of
honey
no
other
flavors
really
asserted
themselves
cant
say
i
would
recommend
this
coors
brewing
company
product
overall
it
was
a
fairly
solid
beer
especially
from
a
mass
produced
beer
i
wont
seek
out
another
but
if
thats
all
that
was
available
i
wouldnt
be
upset
its
easy
to
drink
and
not
overthetop
sweet
like
some
other
summer
ales
taste
the
lemonyorange
citric
zip
refreshes
can
this
be
an
ale
with
zero
hop
presence
wheat
is
light
which
means
the
flavor
is
toointentional
yes
though
the
evening
is
not
muggy
or
hot
it
still
works
as
coors
intended
yet
this
one
should
best
the
og
blue
moon
in
taste
and
i
am
not
sure
it
doesplus
id
rather
have
the
real
lemon
or
orange
in
the
glass
not
in
the
bottle
overall
this
finishes
with
an
almost
dish
detergent
lemon
drizzle
and
isnt
really
slammable
because
it
actually
is
slammable
enough
gold
in
color
with
light
and
foamy
head
honey
and
grain
on
the
nose
small
amount
of
prickle
bubbles
are
present
the
attack
is
pretty
smooth
with
a
little
graininess
that
is
well
concealed
by
the
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
might
be
due
to
the
honey
influence
as
the
mouthfeel
is
much
more
syrupy
than
the
typical
blue
moon
there
is
a
strong
grain
flavor
late
but
still
remains
pleasant
the
finish
is
clean
there
is
some
honey
in
the
aftertaste
and
a
grippiness
like
that
experienced
with
some
wines
i
like
blue
moon
belgian
white
but
this
is
nothing
close
virtually
no
hoppiness
it
smells
very
sweet
with
very
little
malt
the
taste
is
wriiten
right
on
the
bottle
honey
that
describes
this
beer
liquid
honey
if
you
prefer
that
sort
of
thing
this
beer
is
for
you
but
if
you
like
a
kick
in
the
ass
this
is
not
it
overall
this
beer
is
ok
nothing
to
get
excited
about
i
will
avoid
it
if
possible
pours
clear
with
a
very
pale
near
white
color
nice
head
and
decent
lacing
fairly
neutral
scent
not
much
to
it
but
a
slight
sweetness
nice
taste
decent
amounts
of
sweet
wheat
malt
and
a
small
hint
of
orange
peel
huge
honey
flavor
the
name
was
a
good
choice
it
had
meadlike
qualities
with
the
amount
of
honey
in
the
flavor
went
down
very
smooth
its
easy
to
drink
another
nice
macromicro
from
coors
blue
moon
line
like
a
bad
lager
mixed
with
some
honey
syrup
my
first
impression
of
honey
moon
was
that
it
doesnt
really
taste
like
beer
its
more
like
a
really
bad
light
cider
mixed
with
artificial
honey
the
honey
flavor
really
isnt
all
bad
but
the
grainy
offflavored
malt
and
nonexistent
hops
kill
it
for
me
id
like
to
give
it
a
lower
score
at
least
compared
to
real
beers
and
the
style
but
its
definitely
not
at
quite
the
depths
of
something
like
cheap
malt
liquor
the
aroma
is
disappointingly
weak
the
appearance
is
poor
at
best
the
beer
is
an
odd
color
a
light
sickly
yellow
with
an
awful
fizzy
head
that
immediately
dissipates
to
nothing
i
generally
dont
care
about
appearance
but
some
of
these
big
massproduced
beers
look
very
odd
especially
the
sweet
ones
the
feel
is
way
more
cloying
than
it
should
be
particularly
for
a
beer
made
with
honey
drinkability
is
low
but
i
can
get
through
a
glass
when
its
cold
a
pretty
bad
beer
overall
a
nice
refreshing
brew
but
not
what
i
would
like
to
see
in
a
apwa
d
i
liked
this
better
than
blue
moon
the
honey
addition
is
perfect
for
summer
although
minimal
but
it
works
because
to
much
would
have
made
this
overly
sweet
and
not
a
good
candidate
for
a
summer
quaff
5
2
is
low
and
any
more
would
be
uncivilized
i
did
not
want
any
more
after
my
12oz
though
drinkability
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
weather
session
thing
the
carbonation
is
too
weak
and
the
mouthfeel
comes
across
almost
syrupy
because
of
how
inappropriately
sweet
it
is
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
very
sweet
with
honey
and
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
a
malty
flavor
up
front
with
a
sweet
honey
kick
in
the
middle
and
slight
fruity
bitterness
in
the
finish
not
bad
not
good
but
average
taste
decent
mouthfeel
nice
and
crisp
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
alright
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
but
the
sweetness
might
get
to
me
after
a
couple
drinkability
pretty
good
a
nice
low
cost
and
fairly
simple
session
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
smells
of
wheat
some
malt
and
hints
of
spiciness
and
orange
the
taste
is
very
light
with
first
notes
of
the
wheat
and
spice
and
the
citrus
cutting
through
towards
the
end
tastes
like
a
sweeter
and
spicier
version
of
its
brother
product
blue
moon
the
mouthfeel
of
honey
moon
is
very
lightbodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
throughout
id
say
that
this
is
very
fairly
drinkable
this
one
pours
a
hazy
opaque
orangegold
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
wheaty
and
slightly
malty
with
a
hint
of
orange
flavor
is
wheaty
with
a
strong
orange
overtone
that
is
slightly
but
pleasantly
sour
smooth
fizzy
texture
leaves
nice
wheaty
and
citrus
finish
i
actually
am
sort
of
shocked
that
there
is
some
honey
essence
to
this
beer
rather
than
just
some
macro
placebo
with
a
sleight
of
hand
using
dashes
of
chemicalflavors
its
a
bit
sweet
with
a
light
body
though
not
thin
or
watery
it
has
some
witbeer
character
actually
a
bit
of
orange
peel
and
clove
would
i
ever
buy
it
or
choose
it
over
your
average
true
craft
beer
hell
no
but
i
guess
when
you
compare
it
to
its
other
garnishable
typical
american
bbq
choices
its
not
so
bad
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
and
recedes
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
honey
and
tangy
wheat
it
has
no
real
complexity
but
it
is
quite
strong
the
taste
has
a
larger
honey
character
and
only
a
hint
of
wheat
again
it
lacks
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
that
somewhat
gets
in
the
way
of
the
taste
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
would
drink
again
when
poured
the
color
was
medium
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
little
amount
of
foam
and
retention
was
non
existant
the
smell
of
citrus
was
evident
along
with
a
hint
of
wheat
malts
the
taste
had
a
bitter
citrus
feel
on
the
palate
that
was
expecialy
pleasing
taste
this
is
just
an
average
summer
ale
if
at
that
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
golden
color
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
which
settles
some
but
is
retained
as
a
half
finger
head
very
active
carbonation
this
is
on
the
verge
of
fizzy
aroma
is
of
citrus
spice
1st
sip
is
sweet
the
honey
jumps
out
right
away
with
the
citrus
orange
riding
its
coattails
the
after
taste
is
of
slightly
bitter
orange
peel
with
a
hint
of
peppery
spice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
crisp
refreshing
and
i
could
easily
see
sessioning
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
summer
ale
one
that
would
make
a
great
complement
to
food
fresh
off
the
grill
at
a
backyard
cookout
nice
stuff
pours
a
honey
yellow
that
is
a
tad
hazy
and
a
nice
thick
film
sticks
to
the
glass
smells
sweet
floral
wheaty
and
crisp
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
not
much
hoppiness
but
the
honey
and
orange
peel
are
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
alright
and
drinkability
is
high
a
very
soothing
drinker
i
wouldnt
mind
nursing
a
few
bottles
of
these
during
the
course
of
a
night
d
just
okay
for
me
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
one
it
wasnt
bad
it
just
wasnt
different
enough
for
me
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
over
somethign
else
d
this
was
a
wedding
gift
sixpack
from
a
great
lady
of
my
favorite
friends
of
my
new
bride
this
was
okay
ill
have
no
trouble
getting
through
all
six
it
does
make
me
want
to
try
a
good
wheat
beer
with
honey
though
can
anyone
recommend
one
i
drank
my
first
bottle
out
of
a
glass
but
quickly
switched
to
bottles
because
i
hate
the
straight
up
grain
smell
reminiscent
of
the
rolling
rock
extra
pale
borefest
i
tasted
wheat
and
the
typical
blue
moon
orange
flavor
with
a
honey
aftertaste
this
beer
is
crisp
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
md
smooth
mouthfeel
almost
like
very
lightly
cabonated
water
on
the
tongue
i
could
consume
alot
if
they
were
around
d
blue
moon
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
the
blue
moon
products
ive
tried
this
is
the
worst
if
offered
id
probably
ask
what
else
was
available
before
settling
on
this
id
definitely
drink
the
original
blue
moon
over
it
d
not
an
impressive
offering
i
wont
have
this
again
if
i
can
help
it
i
know
this
is
bmc
and
i
know
its
a
cheesy
conceptwheat
beer
with
honey
but
this
was
good
crystal
clear
golden
color
decent
white
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
doughy
malts
honey
and
sweet
orange
peel
sweet
honeyed
biscuity
malts
dominate
with
a
slightly
sour
almost
drying
finish
crisp
tangy
light
in
body
nicely
carbonated
with
the
honey
lingering
in
a
good
way
semisweet
finish
but
not
too
cloying
this
would
be
sessionable
in
the
summer
hazy
amber
with
modest
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
taste
is
bready
clean
somewhat
crisp
like
a
good
apple
slight
orange
flavor
would
be
a
good
beer
for
those
who
dont
appreciate
beer
much
very
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
the
balance
of
flavors
and
carbonation
are
very
well
done
a
bit
too
slick
and
sweet
for
frequent
consumption
great
beer
overall
the
blue
moon
series
of
beers
are
pretty
impressive
i
do
enjoy
them
they
are
a
pretty
decent
go
to
beer
as
far
as
archaine
oklahoma
beer
laws
in
the
grocery
stores
go
will
i
buy
this
one
again
why
yes
i
will
it
is
a
pretty
good
32
beer
not
bad
at
all
it
is
almost
like
a
somewhat
decent
desert
at
a
chain
resteraunt
notes
i
have
determined
i
love
blue
moon
especially
from
the
tap
the
bottle
taste
does
not
do
it
many
favors
concealing
some
of
its
character
however
with
the
honey
brew
i
could
stand
it
in
the
bottle
more
so
than
the
original
final
thoughts
decent
attempt
but
the
sweetness
overshadows
any
attempt
at
complexity
its
real
easy
to
drink
its
got
a
mouthfeel
that
is
off
the
mark
only
by
must
a
little
bit
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
but
not
a
great
summer
beer
good
in
small
sips
as
apposed
to
just
guzzling
this
beer
just
sip
and
enjoy
anyway
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
finger
thick
head
and
could
immediately
smell
the
honey
and
lemon
peel
after
the
first
sip
i
was
immediately
impressed
with
how
light
it
tasted
being
that
it
had
a
dark
brown
complexion
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
summer
outting
and
may
i
suggest
you
still
incorporate
an
orange
and
maybe
a
lemon
to
let
it
taste
even
better
even
though
it
doesnt
need
any
help
its
not
bad
but
really
doesnt
beg
to
be
drank
again
mfd
light
and
crisp
easy
drinking
enough
just
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
d
its
not
undrinkable
but
if
it
were
to
be
wiped
off
the
face
of
the
earth
i
wouldnt
be
too
upset
this
beer
can
probably
be
drunk
by
people
who
dont
really
like
beer
and
by
beer
bores
alike
the
beer
bore
will
wish
he
was
drinking
something
better
though
which
is
ultimatley
how
this
beer
will
make
you
feel
however
to
its
credit
it
has
a
refreshing
feel
that
could
probably
just
hit
the
spot
on
that
summer
afternoon
after
you
were
working
although
youd
probabley
want
to
hit
the
spot
with
a
better
quality
brew
than
this
drinkable
id
say
so
i
honestly
think
it
could
be
better
with
a
slice
of
orange
having
lacked
said
fruit
i
opted
for
a
jarred
mandarin
orange
after
the
review
really
didnt
do
much
for
the
flavor
just
made
the
whole
beer
a
bit
more
syrupy
the
citrus
of
a
real
orange
would
really
change
this
beer
could
be
a
winner
for
hot
summer
days
definitely
not
the
best
example
of
this
style
but
probably
delicious
for
someone
who
wants
a
crisp
summer
beer
d
an
alright
summer
beer
that
doesnt
offend
but
doesnt
offer
much
of
anything
significant
either
d
this
was
actually
a
lot
better
than
i
originally
remember
decently
refreshing
brew
kindof
grainy
and
macro
feeling
drinkabilty
unenjoyable
to
me
not
one
i
will
be
lookin
for
again
just
to
much
of
that
fake
citrus
flavor
to
me
and
to
much
sweet
honey
couldnt
imagine
having
more
then
one
of
these
with
the
odd
after
flavor
it
has
on
the
finish
definitely
worth
a
try
dnot
a
hit
with
me
a
nice
looking
and
feeling
beer
but
it
really
lacks
in
the
more
important
flavor
and
aroma
departments
suds
tasted
very
creamy
and
orange
flavored
tasted
crisp
w
an
orangehoney
aftertaste
that
never
becomes
too
sweet
definitely
just
made
it
into
my
list
of
favorite
beers
not
my
pint
of
ale
but
its
good
for
what
it
is
a
very
good
choice
to
ween
people
of
bmc
my
wife
likes
these
beers
so
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
it
turned
out
to
be
a
bit
lacking
it
was
a
mostly
clear
but
maybe
a
little
hazy
golden
color
small
white
head
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
which
on
tasting
i
thought
must
be
honey
it
was
overly
sweet
and
not
a
beer
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
pours
a
semi
cloudy
clearish
pale
yellow
color
body
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
diminishing
very
wheaty
malty
aroma
some
sweetness
a
lot
of
honey
very
effervescent
light
tasting
flowery
and
some
honey
light
sweet
soft
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
some
orange
flavor
too
maybe
orange
zest
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
i
thought
it
would
have
the
traditionally
aggressive
flavors
that
i
feel
most
blue
moon
products
have
but
it
was
very
drinkable
the
honey
taste
is
well
balanced
with
traditional
hefe
weizen
flavors
drinkability
overall
for
a
summer
offering
i
enjoyed
it
if
this
was
presented
to
me
at
another
time
i
probably
wouldnt
have
enjoyed
it
as
much
its
a
likeable
brew
and
has
good
qualities
but
alot
of
the
flaws
in
the
original
blue
moon
carry
over
into
here
especially
in
the
nose
and
the
mouthfeel
otherwise
a
very
decent
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
just
dont
expect
to
be
wowed
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
from
our
friends
in
colorado
it
wont
give
gumballhead
a
run
for
its
money
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
either
this
is
fairly
drinkable
but
i
do
not
like
the
sweetness
ill
buy
again
highly
drinkable
example
of
a
honey
ale
a
very
nice
honey
flavor
kicks
in
at
the
middle
to
delight
the
taste
buds
i
looked
forward
to
it
every
sip
the
head
was
disappointing
for
a
beer
using
wheat
malts
and
the
aroma
was
pleasant
but
could
have
been
more
interesting
or
robust
overall
this
beer
is
a
winner
and
i
would
buy
it
again
however
i
would
buy
it
only
if
others
were
going
to
drink
it
for
i
only
need
one
of
these
before
the
honey
novelty
wears
off
the
honey
taste
is
certainly
a
nice
touch
it
in
no
way
overpowers
or
is
cloying
the
beer
seems
to
lack
substance
but
maybe
my
mind
will
change
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
poured
this
into
a
standard
pilz
glass
and
observed
a
serious
amount
of
trub
in
my
glass
that
threw
the
appearance
off
a
bit
but
nevertheless
it
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
wisp
of
head
on
top
nose
is
slightly
sweet
and
reminiscent
of
rice
or
other
adjuncts
taste
is
fair
slightly
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
medium
with
just
a
bit
of
a
zing
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
ok
but
just
not
my
style
perhaps
its
yours
d
3
0
not
bad
just
not
great
a
mediocre
rep
for
the
style
so
its
not
my
first
pick
for
drinkability
overall
it
was
an
okay
beer
there
could
be
more
flavor
than
what
was
there
was
left
wanting
more
an
interesting
beer
starts
out
like
a
typical
blue
moon
with
the
citrus
and
wheat
flavor
but
soon
proceeds
to
a
sweet
honey
taste
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
very
smooth
very
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
love
the
aftertaste
great
summer
beer
but
a
little
watered
down
and
dull
aroma
is
not
overly
flattering
but
not
terrible
some
citrus
and
honey
notes
but
they
dont
meld
too
well
color
is
pale
lemonade
yellow
the
start
is
all
malty
and
fruity
some
citrus
zestiness
and
honey
come
through
in
the
finish
fairly
refreshing
and
light
bodied
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
overpriced
for
what
it
is
this
is
a
really
refreshing
quaff
kinda
dull
in
taste
and
smell
it
is
simply
put
easy
drinkin
pours
like
a
summer
ale
should
but
i
expected
a
bit
more
on
the
nose
flavor
of
a
typical
summer
ale
malty
with
a
strong
honey
punch
that
lives
up
to
the
name
spicy
citrusy
however
this
beer
is
crippled
by
a
biting
stinging
carbonation
way
too
much
carbonation
in
this
beer
kills
mouthfeel
and
puts
the
flavor
in
the
backseat
oits
light
enough
you
could
have
a
couple
but
nothing
that
keeps
my
interest
long
enough
to
have
a
lot
decent
but
not
great
its
weird
though
how
it
tastes
like
you
put
honey
straight
into
your
beer
even
makes
your
lips
sticky
overall
eh
okay
d
this
is
a
shame
because
i
really
do
enjoy
blue
moon
when
i
am
in
a
bind
or
just
want
a
cheap
session
this
beer
could
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
and
needs
some
tweaking
still
a
worthy
effort
and
it
is
drinkable
but
just
not
the
most
enjoyable
of
beers
5
more
to
go
figured
for
that
price
i
couldnt
pass
up
trying
it
tastes
like
the
standard
run
of
the
mill
summer
beer
meaning
its
a
wheat
with
citrus
flavors
and
little
or
no
body
is
a
nice
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
but
outside
of
that
situation
i
dont
think
it
will
do
me
any
good
drinkability
a
solid
drinkable
beer
nothing
fancy
perhaps
a
little
sweet
this
beer
poured
a
honeycolor
with
a
fluffy
twofinger
head
that
lingered
for
a
while
this
beer
is
sweet
smelling
with
some
honey
and
spices
the
taste
is
surprisingly
less
sweet
than
the
smell
although
it
starts
off
with
honey
that
gives
way
to
some
citrus
with
some
floral
accents
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
with
very
fine
carbonation
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
thats
pretty
middle
of
the
road
as
far
as
quality
goes
not
a
bad
beer
to
grab
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
i
doubt
id
grab
more
than
one
perfect
for
a
hot
day
i
had
this
after
just
finishing
a
little
yard
work
it
was
a
great
antidote
for
this
horridly
swealtering
georgia
heat
i
drank
this
beer
right
from
the
bottle
so
i
did
not
get
the
best
view
of
its
appearance
the
smell
of
this
reminded
me
of
fresh
muffins
for
some
reason
taste
of
citrus
and
the
honey
of
course
different
than
the
other
wheat
ales
ive
had
but
still
good
crisp
and
clean
very
refreshing
brew
that
i
would
quaff
on
most
any
day
hints
of
orange
with
tons
of
suck
this
is
by
far
the
worst
summer
beer
i
have
ever
had
this
has
hints
of
corn
and
leaves
an
after
taste
that
leaves
somthing
to
be
disered
i
wouldent
wish
this
peace
of
crap
on
even
my
worst
enimeys
suck
suck
suck
and
did
i
mention
suck
theoretically
a
honeyed
version
of
their
famous
blue
moon
belgian
white
poured
out
of
the
bottle
a
cloudy
sandy
blonde
color
with
a
large
two
finger
head
of
white
foam
that
faded
in
a
few
minutes
time
to
a
scant
ring
weak
lacing
sweet
artificial
nose
like
sweet
and
low
with
orange
extract
not
good
flavors
are
equally
perplexing
and
notably
off
fake
flavoring
very
little
wheat
puckering
finish
something
in
it
reminds
me
of
tang
orange
drink
about
what
i
would
expect
from
the
coors
brewery
but
clearly
worse
than
the
original
blue
moon
if
it
aint
broke
this
is
overall
a
good
summer
brew
d
decent
enough
for
a
summer
beer
on
a
hot
day
sometimes
when
honey
is
added
to
the
beer
its
not
always
noticeable
or
lends
an
odd
character
to
the
sweetness
here
thats
not
an
issue
im
sure
this
was
meant
to
be
consumed
out
of
the
bottle
no
sediment
who
wants
a
chunk
of
yeast
in
their
mouth
light
malt
flavors
with
a
strong
taste
of
honey
and
a
twistoff
cap
this
beer
actually
isnt
too
bad
and
very
drinkable
makes
a
great
summer
beer
picked
a
sixer
up
and
went
strait
to
the
plastic
cup
i
thought
the
beer
looked
good
there
certainly
wasnt
anything
bad
about
it
but
like
most
reviews
have
stated
nothing
really
impressive
either
even
my
rookie
palette
could
detect
the
honey
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
so
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
drinking
more
of
them
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
night
if
theyre
available
i
cant
say
itll
be
a
goto
beer
by
any
means
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
nothing
to
special
soft
mouthfeel
pretty
refreshing
the
sweetness
is
not
overberaing
despite
my
gripes
which
i
have
more
of
than
praise
this
did
do
the
trick
in
terms
of
a
quick
summer
quencher
but
wouldnt
you
rather
quench
with
an
oberon
or
even
a
stone
pale
ale
instead
if
this
was
sitting
at
the
company
picnic
or
family
reunion
along
with
bud
light
and
miller
chill
you
would
consider
it
manna
from
heaven
but
theres
not
much
more
to
truly
recommend
it
nice
try
but
ill
stick
with
oberon
tried
this
at
a
local
hole
not
watering
hole
just
a
hole
anyway
it
had
a
nice
smell
obviously
a
tad
sweet
in
smell
and
flavor
due
to
the
honey
and
much
like
the
belgian
white
version
very
refreshing
personally
a
tad
too
sweet
to
down
a
bunch
of
these
so
after
just
1
i
went
back
to
the
original
on
tap
as
it
was
more
refreshing
and
50
cents
cheaper
than
the
honey
moon
not
bad
at
all
though
and
a
nice
one
to
try
during
these
hot
lazyhazy
days
of
summer
why
not
have
a
lazyhazy
wheat
beer
worth
a
try
in
my
opinion
but
remember
theres
honey
in
there
for
some
reason
this
honey
moon
was
better
than
mine
ha
joke
for
all
you
married
fellas
like
me
cheers
and
saaalute
my
ba
friends
overall
very
humdrum
flavors
are
weak
and
bland
avoid
either
way
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
from
blue
moon
hate
blue
moon
but
i
love
their
seasonals
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
large
foamy
head
on
a
slightly
cloudy
very
light
yellow
body
smell
was
weak
of
orange
and
honey
very
faint
they
came
through
much
better
in
the
taste
however
reminded
me
of
leinies
honey
weiss
only
with
more
wheatness
very
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
summer
brew
d
im
sure
many
like
this
as
a
summer
brew
due
to
the
light
feel
the
sweetness
is
just
a
bit
over
the
top
in
my
opinion
d
by
the
second
beer
it
was
harder
to
deal
with
the
sweet
honey
taste
but
you
know
im
not
for
sweets
anyway
overall
boo
drinkability
not
bad
not
as
good
as
anchors
summer
but
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
drinking
a
bouquet
of
flowers
ahem
a
bottle
of
regular
blue
moon
d
a
surprisingly
good
wheat
beer
from
coors
the
blue
moon
beers
that
i
have
had
from
them
have
been
rather
good
id
take
this
over
the
sam
adams
summer
really
like
the
honey
flavour
in
the
end
drinkability
is
ok
drinkability
was
low
the
honey
and
spices
were
just
too
much
for
me
i
didnt
like
it
from
the
first
sip
and
only
grew
more
sick
of
it
as
i
powered
through
drinkability
the
last
time
i
will
ever
have
this
one
and
i
have
five
more
to
go
anyone
want
to
buy
em
off
me
d
ill
never
drink
this
again
deasy
to
drink
as
a
summer
ale
should
be
ive
enjoyed
all
of
blue
moons
seasonals
besides
their
spring
too
much
lime
and
this
is
another
success
its
like
their
full
moon
just
honey
rather
than
brown
sugar
taste
and
noticiably
warmer
picked
up
a
six
at
a
local
grocery
store
while
vacationing
in
myrtle
beach
sc
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
a
pull
date
of
090808
printed
on
the
neck
the
beer
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
orange
taste
is
of
wheat
malt
with
just
a
little
orange
and
just
a
kiss
of
sweet
honey
in
the
background
not
a
bad
beer
for
those
hot
summer
days
in
the
carolinas
but
there
are
better
summer
beers
out
there
overall
not
a
bad
very
light
bodied
water
substitute
however
i
think
i
will
pass
on
it
again
it
was
not
terrible
or
bad
just
way
too
light
and
boring
for
my
tastes
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
the
standardissue
blue
moon
is
acceptable
this
however
is
kind
of
icky
notes
its
not
overly
complex
but
it
gives
you
a
refreshing
simple
quick
hit
of
flavor
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
can
easily
put
2
or
3
of
these
away
it
is
nice
and
refreshing
overall
not
bad
but
not
excellent
great
for
hot
summer
days
if
it
werent
for
the
overtly
sweet
tones
of
the
honey
at
times
this
would
make
for
a
pretty
damn
good
wheat
ale
however
if
i
wanted
a
drinkable
light
brew
from
these
guys
id
go
with
the
standard
blue
moon
cheap
too
if
youre
on
a
budget
im
not
sure
what
the
abv
of
this
is
but
it
cant
be
over
5
much
like
the
aftertaste
that
im
searching
for
as
i
swish
this
around
my
mouth
i
dont
think
theres
any
alcohol
present
yes
its
there
but
thats
about
the
only
thing
that
can
be
found
as
my
mind
and
the
taste
of
this
have
moved
onto
greener
pastures
only
worth
a
try
if
the
hop
shortage
has
made
your
favorite
brew
unaffordable
and
ya
need
a
beer
fix
d
personally
this
was
okay
but
too
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
regularly
i
guess
some
could
consider
this
a
nice
sessionable
seasonal
ale
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
was
a
little
disappointed
after
trying
coors
attempt
at
a
belgian
wheatstyle
in
blue
moon
there
are
some
orange
flavors
in
there
too
with
the
honey
they
both
are
toning
down
the
wheat
flavors
too
there
is
a
subtle
honey
after
taste
to
it
very
light
drinkable
but
keep
it
cold
this
is
a
summer
session
beer
d
i
think
that
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
seasonal
brew
its
light
and
has
a
refreshing
taste
its
not
the
best
one
out
there
but
still
a
good
one
md
overall
the
beer
had
good
carbonation
not
too
much
but
enough
i
thought
that
the
beer
was
light
and
refreshing
extremely
drinkable
and
one
that
i
might
reach
for
again
d
nothing
to
go
nuts
about
a
bit
too
sweet
and
subdued
in
overall
flavor
to
be
enjoyable
for
more
than
a
pint
at
least
i
got
a
free
glass
out
of
it
this
appears
a
clear
golen
color
in
my
pint
glass
it
has
an
average
light
tan
head
the
nose
has
grainy
wheat
malts
with
a
touch
of
clover
honey
the
taste
has
a
light
wheat
flavor
with
an
unbalanced
sweet
honey
presence
a
clean
crisp
body
goes
down
well
a
good
drinker
but
nothing
special
i
had
a
chance
to
take
a
look
at
the
reviews
for
this
beer
on
here
before
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
from
what
i
read
i
thought
this
might
be
a
decent
beer
but
this
was
not
the
case
to
me
this
is
a
blue
moon
with
honey
sweetness
appearance
is
cream
gold
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
smell
is
kind
of
sweet
and
the
same
with
the
taste
i
happened
to
drink
one
of
these
with
pizza
and
the
spice
of
the
pizza
masked
the
sweetness
and
made
honey
mooon
a
drinkable
beverage
i
dont
think
i
would
be
able
drink
this
with
out
something
with
some
twang
to
eat
along
side
it
not
a
bad
summer
alefor
a
coors
product
i
drank
cold
drectly
from
the
bottle
from
what
i
saw
it
looked
orangeyellow
smelled
like
honey
and
orange
with
some
floral
notes
tasted
refreshing
with
honey
and
some
citrus
but
mot
overly
sweet
i
could
see
sipping
a
few
of
these
while
laying
by
the
pool
on
a
hot
july
day
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
would
never
order
this
again
definatly
not
what
i
would
call
a
good
american
pale
wheat
ale
it
tastes
like
a
typical
macro
brewery
version
of
summer
beer
extremely
drinkable
the
honey
sweetness
isnt
excessive
nice
beer
mediumbodied
highly
carbonated
good
drinkability
youd
expect
from
a
coorsinbeersclothing
d
pretty
good
drinkability
a
nice
summer
quencher
that
was
citrusy
and
refreshing
could
easily
enjoy
this
in
multiples
regardless
of
many
peoples
perception
of
the
brewery
this
makes
for
a
refreshing
summer
time
drink
the
color
of
the
beer
is
dark
yellow
head
with
a
short
white
froth
smell
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
orange
taste
is
orange
and
wheat
with
a
sweet
hint
of
honey
mouthfeel
is
lite
not
overly
carbonated
not
as
drinkable
as
some
other
beers
but
not
bad
either
i
would
definitely
bring
this
to
a
summer
gathering
when
your
trying
to
show
a
little
class
above
the
bud
lightmiller
lite
crew
but
not
show
off
over
all
this
wasnt
too
bad
of
brew
this
beer
has
no
discernible
flavor
to
set
it
above
other
summer
seasonal
offerings
i
think
thats
about
it
really
there
is
nothing
to
distinguish
this
beer
and
im
having
a
hard
time
remembering
it
even
as
i
sip
away
on
one
while
listed
as
an
ale
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
traditional
american
lager
with
honey
added
it
peoured
nice
and
clear
with
a
thin
head
i
was
dissapointed
with
my
first
taste
i
expected
more
ale
than
honey
i
believe
the
honey
overrides
the
taste
while
not
bad
it
is
not
great
eather
session
for
somebut
not
me
too
sweet
for
my
taste
carbonation
was
sort
of
highbut
that
was
not
a
problem
if
you
like
wheat
beers
and
honey
this
will
be
a
great
beer
for
you
overall
because
of
this
beers
refreshing
nature
smooth
texture
and
sweet
finish
id
recommend
it
to
any
beer
drinker
looking
for
a
nice
alternative
to
other
summer
beers
d
ill
give
this
a
3
because
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
but
even
by
the
end
of
the
glass
the
sweetness
was
getting
to
me
a
little
bit
this
would
be
a
good
pick
to
introduce
some
nonbeer
drinkers
to
nonmacro
beer
the
sweetness
wouldnt
bother
someone
who
doesnt
drink
a
lot
of
beer
but
the
total
absence
of
hops
in
this
brew
really
hurts
its
drinkability
for
me
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
mild
thirst
quencher
and
candidate
for
a
session
beer
overall
a
great
refreshing
beer
definitely
the
type
of
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
summer
day
very
easy
to
drink
great
flavor
why
doesnt
it
taste
better
starts
off
like
a
nice
creamsicle
peaks
as
a
honey
wheat
and
ends
as
phenolic
icky
the
mouthfeel
is
wholly
unsatisfying
its
got
a
lighttomid
body
but
the
finish
is
terrible
i
think
they
were
trying
to
dry
it
out
to
make
it
refreshing
like
the
bottle
promises
but
i
think
they
just
gave
up
on
the
hops
any
spicy
finishing
hop
would
give
this
the
little
bite
it
needs
as
it
is
i
almost
poured
it
out
almost
how
did
this
clear
the
focus
groups
millercoors
drinkability
is
nice
as
well
dvery
high
definately
good
for
the
summer
months
like
a
car
wreck
look
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
and
move
on
this
review
was
dictated
by
my
girlfriend
who
usually
hates
this
syle
of
beer
personally
i
think
that
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
buttered
popcorn
but
that
might
just
from
the
gulden
draak
that
we
just
reviewed
worth
a
shot
for
a
summer
beer
dideal
for
the
golf
course
barbecue
or
fishing
boat
in
summer
as
advertised
but
i
could
enjoy
this
in
any
weather
strap
it
down
for
a
nice
long
session
approachable
drinkable
enjoyablebut
like
i
said
earlier
not
a
light
beer
5
6
abv
and
nice
body
have
fun
with
this
one
drinkability
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
decent
enough
for
a
forgettable
quaffer
inoffensive
is
the
best
compliment
i
can
give
it
honey
moon
summer
ale
pours
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
sweet
honey
i
guess
the
flavor
is
also
very
sweet
you
definitely
taste
the
honey
a
fair
amount
of
wheat
and
a
touch
of
citrus
are
also
present
a
bit
of
graininess
also
comes
through
easy
to
drink
really
just
a
sweeter
substitute
for
macro
lager
imho
id
buy
it
again
but
maybe
wait
for
the
summer
to
have
this
summer
brew
a
hot
day
brew
for
sure
smell
is
somewhat
malty
light
honey
taste
is
of
honey
as
well
as
wheat
a
bit
bread
like
but
not
too
bad
im
not
a
huge
blue
moon
fan
but
this
is
probably
the
best
product
ive
had
of
theres
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
slight
aftertaste
but
overall
decent
finish
pretty
nice
summer
brew
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
light
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
some
all
the
way
down
it
has
a
light
aroma
of
sweet
malts
some
honey
and
a
slight
hoppy
bitter
smell
the
taste
is
the
same
with
mostly
a
sweet
wheat
taste
with
a
very
small
amount
of
honey
and
a
very
faint
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
very
end
it
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
as
it
is
very
light
and
crisp
which
would
be
very
refreshing
during
the
summer
months
which
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
bad
from
coors
doverall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
mild
and
easy
to
drink
yet
i
still
like
the
original
much
better
i
havent
had
any
of
these
blue
moon
seasonal
collection
beers
that
i
have
really
liked
yet
theyre
at
least
opening
the
general
public
up
to
more
beers
because
i
know
a
lot
of
people
who
really
like
blue
moon
and
theyll
buy
this
beer
based
on
brand
name
the
blue
moon
seasonal
beers
dont
seem
to
rate
well
on
here
and
usually
i
agree
however
i
like
this
one
this
beer
has
a
nice
sweet
taste
and
is
a
great
drink
for
a
nice
summer
day
picnic
bbq
or
for
the
beach
it
goes
well
with
food
in
my
opinion
too
not
as
good
as
the
classic
blue
moon
though
d
smooth
and
very
daily
drinkable
refreshing
sweetness
drinkability
refreshing
beer
easy
drinking
for
the
summer
another
great
one
from
blue
moon
to
much
honey
sweetness
for
my
taste
and
not
enough
beer
taste
wow
i
had
this
the
same
night
as
a
sapporo
and
the
two
beers
actually
have
a
lot
in
common
honey
moon
was
a
little
thicker
and
sweeter
there
was
also
a
hint
of
wheat
in
it
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
just
a
bland
clean
beer
like
the
sapporo
i
mean
the
sapporo
at
least
had
a
bit
of
hops
this
just
hints
at
having
malt
and
not
much
else
pass
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
the
pour
is
a
clear
yellow
with
a
bright
white
frothy
head
that
fades
with
the
lacing
a
thin
coating
upon
the
glass
nose
has
a
decent
malt
presence
hints
of
honey
fresh
and
clean
start
has
an
adequate
grain
presence
sweet
with
the
top
light
finish
has
an
acceptable
acidity
the
hops
mild
and
the
aftertaste
overly
sweet
and
long
lasting
an
average
beer
nothing
more
nothing
less
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
especially
in
the
hot
summer
weather
d
i
was
not
terribly
impressed
i
had
a
tough
time
getting
it
down
as
it
warmed
it
just
became
too
sweet
for
my
taste
smell
dominated
by
honey
tastes
like
honey
also
hints
of
graham
crackers
and
orange
this
is
alright
and
initially
i
kind
of
liked
it
but
im
down
to
the
last
of
the
6pack
and
its
not
really
my
thing
the
honey
flavor
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
and
other
than
the
honey
flavor
theres
not
much
else
going
on
something
about
the
consistency
is
a
little
more
dense
than
i
would
like
it
as
well
nice
enough
appearance
golden
with
a
nice
thick
white
headlivelly
carbonation
nothing
much
at
all
to
the
aroma
though
maltyslightly
spicy
not
offensive
flavour
is
sweet
of
course
but
honey
sweet
and
surprisingly
not
artificialthere
is
a
goodly
amount
of
malt
backing
too
and
some
slightly
overripe
but
still
edible
oranges
palte
is
kinda
thick
but
finishes
crisp
inthe
endthough
i
can
taste
honey
in
the
after
taste
for
a
while
weird
beer
not
sure
if
this
an
american
wheat
its
not
bad
for
a
summer
thirst
quencher
pours
a
pale
color
with
a
nice
head
that
retains
aroma
smells
of
honey
and
wheat
and
is
relatively
inoffensive
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
up
front
with
a
lot
of
honey
notes
and
some
wheatiness
somewhat
biscuity
with
a
nice
touch
of
honey
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
nice
wheat
undertones
though
the
honey
might
be
overdone
by
just
a
bit
a
really
nice
inoffensive
version
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
definitely
better
than
the
regular
blue
moon
i
had
pours
pale
decent
head
that
goes
away
quickly
smells
are
sweet
can
notice
the
honey
in
it
tastes
is
malty
definitely
honey
sweetness
but
it
all
seems
a
bit
out
of
whack
to
me
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
good
its
a
easily
drinkable
beer
but
something
about
the
honey
sweetness
takes
away
the
drinkability
to
me
overall
not
very
impressed
this
fits
the
summer
quencher
bill
but
i
should
have
known
better
id
much
rather
have
a
new
belgium
product
like
a
blue
paddle
pilsner
or
one
of
their
wheat
beers
or
even
boulevards
wheat
than
this
or
a
real
saison
from
ommegang
golden
pour
with
nice
white
head
that
hung
around
a
while
can
taste
the
honey
in
this
one
not
bad
but
the
flavor
is
kind
of
weak
what
flavor
it
has
is
kind
of
fruity
and
tastes
of
the
honey
aroma
is
fruity
as
well
mouthfeel
is
decent
nothing
special
but
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
however
12
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
leaves
a
finger
of
white
head
on
top
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
this
ones
surprisingly
clear
for
a
apwa
i
guess
a
touch
foggy
in
a
straw
color
nose
is
strong
on
orange
i
guess
a
touch
of
sweet
caramel
very
light
wheat
flavor
as
well
not
much
in
the
way
of
spiciness
taste
is
a
strong
mix
of
orange
and
honey
as
advertised
some
light
wheatiness
in
the
aftertaste
carbonation
is
too
high
in
my
opinion
and
the
body
is
a
little
thin
this
ones
okay
its
certainly
not
offensive
but
there
isnt
really
any
reason
to
drink
this
one
and
not
another
apwa
or
even
the
standard
blue
moon
wit
if
youre
dying
for
something
with
the
blue
moon
label
average
mouthfeel
i
dont
see
how
anyone
could
finish
this
one
way
to
sweet
for
me
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
good
retention
and
a
few
thin
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
some
spicy
aromas
with
a
bit
of
honey
you
can
taste
some
honey
sweetness
along
with
the
grain
and
wheat
flavor
is
balanced
with
the
citrus
orange
peel
and
a
bit
of
bitter
finish
similar
to
their
white
ale
but
enough
differences
to
make
it
unique
a
refreshing
summer
seasonal
d
i
would
not
get
another
one
the
smell
and
taste
were
and
bad
and
there
is
certainly
no
honey
taste
in
this
at
all
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
sweet
honey
presence
its
dry
yet
refreshing
the
taste
is
decent
also
it
has
a
pale
wheat
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
but
finishes
a
little
too
sweet
with
a
bit
too
much
honey
flavoring
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
above
average
beer
but
nothing
that
great
im
glad
to
see
more
blue
moon
varieties
but
they
should
shelve
this
one
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
settles
to
a
quarter
inch
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
slight
aromas
of
honey
and
spice
taste
is
mostly
of
honey
with
the
wheat
malt
could
not
pick
out
the
orange
or
orange
rind
at
all
but
the
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
with
a
light
carbonation
thats
very
drinkable
very
smooth
on
the
palate
if
the
orange
had
been
there
it
would
have
been
a
much
better
beer
but
as
it
is
its
still
very
good
overall
an
uneventful
experience
a
nice
easy
beer
to
drink
very
simple
wheat
and
honey
flavors
but
very
good
flavors
and
control
of
tannins
just
a
little
one
dimensional
still
a
very
good
beer
in
the
summer
time
this
is
a
good
beer
to
relax
with
after
you
mow
the
lawn
give
it
a
try
not
bad
at
all
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
amazing
but
imo
better
than
plain
blue
moon
i
could
see
myself
sitting
down
to
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
on
either
a
hot
summer
day
or
shit
on
my
honey
moon
too
overall
a
decent
beer
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
much
better
than
the
average
sixpack
that
you
can
get
in
the
gas
stations
around
here
not
as
good
as
the
original
blue
moon
probably
but
i
have
no
complaints
about
this
one
thanks
to
pegasus
for
the
karma
point
pours
out
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
two
fingers
of
foam
that
dissipates
a
bit
but
hangs
on
decently
well
smells
of
zesty
lemon
and
honey
the
flavor
is
zippy
for
a
beer
like
sugary
lemonade
with
a
pretty
weak
finish
weird
lingering
aftertaste
its
not
horrible
but
you
can
tell
its
not
a
real
quality
brew
either
its
a
tad
fizzy
and
watery
in
the
mouth
more
like
pop
it
goes
down
ok
but
youre
not
dying
for
more
pours
a
three
finger
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
clear
pale
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
lightmedium

faint

has
this
brewed
by
bmbc
in
toronto
ont
1
50
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capitol
convenience
concord
nh
d
overall
the
summer
ale
has
a
very
good
taste
and
is
a
good
compliment
to
the
white
ale
of
the
original
brew
i
could
definitely
drink
a
6pack
of
this
in
any
given
setting
its
what
a
macro
should
be
considering
what
were
looking
at
here
a
macros
summer
seasonal
attempt
this
isnt
bad
at
all
there
isnt
any
of
that
all
too
familiar
phony
and
overdone
fruitiness
the
honey
flavors
are
subtle
but
nice
on
the
nose
and
in
the
aftertaste
i
guess
the
biggest
complaint
that
anyone
can
have
here
is
that
there
really
isnt
a
whole
lot
to
this
beer
it
is
light
even
for
a
summer
ale
and
nobody
at
coors
went
out
on
a
limb
here
this
is
playing
it
safe
for
sure
in
the
end
theres
nothing
offensive
and
it
fits
nicely
next
to
the
belgain
wheat
blue
moon
as
another
suprisingly
decent
coors
specialty
offeringbut
not
as
good
not
bad
a
touch
below
sa
summer
ale
but
easily
above
beach
bum
and
leineys
sunset
wheat
ill
probobly
revisit
this
one
probobly
looked
pretty
good
in
the
glass
and
was
pleasant
to
the
nose
sweet
smelling
good
carb
that
is
about
where
it
ended
based
on
the
name
and
brand
you
immediately
start
comparing
it
to
other
summer
ales
weizens
and
white
ales
not
much
of
a
comparison
tasted
like
what
i
image
weak
mead
tastes
like
pretty
sweet
and
a
good
bit
of
honey
left
over
not
clean
and
crisp
like
a
summer
ale
should
be
i
could
drink
the
whole
6
but
i
likely
wont
buy
again
a
good
weizen
or
white
is
better
for
the
summer
months
the
belgian
white
that
blue
moon
makes
is
much
better
for
the
summer
mouthfeeldrinkability
good
and
easy
to
drink
with
ballanced
carbonation
drinkability
is
allright
i
guess
i
could
drink
a
6
pack
of
these
then
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
for
quite
a
while
only
beer
i
hadnt
tried
at
a
local
steakhouse
though
the
other
choices
werent
very
exciting
anyway
thought
id
give
this
one
a
shot
thought
this
was
very
similar
to
a
sam
adams
summer
ale
which
did
not
impress
me
at
all
when
i
tried
it
a
while
back
lighter
in
body
and
color
than
blue
moons
wheat
beer
this
one
had
a
mix
of
honey
and
malt
complexity
but
also
had
a
cornlike
taste
quenching
on
a
summer
night
but
so
many
other
great
witbiers
out
there
that
ill
pass
on
it
next
time
i
found
this
much
like
the
spring
offering
from
blue
moon
in
my
fridge
after
a
party
poors
very
clean
golden
in
color
with
out
much
of
a
head
i
really
cant
smell
much
of
anything
just
a
bit
of
sweetness
maybee
from
the
honey
the
taste
is
actualy
ok
considering
the
smell
with
the
honey
more
apprent
then
the
orange
another
ok
offering
on
the
same
level
as
the
spring
beer
not
worth
buying
by
any
means
though
unimpressive
all
around
thankfully
i
didnt
pay
for
this
not
very
good
although
not
incredibly
surprising
and
definitely
not
recommended
overall
i
certainly
like
this
more
than
the
regular
blue
moon
but
there
isnt
really
anything
special
to
it
d
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
easy
to
sip
but
theres
hardly
anything
to
excite
the
tastebuds
seems
like
just
one
more
in
a
long
line
of
mediocre
wheat
ales
designed
for
the
summer
months
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
i
didnt
think
that
i
would
like
this
beer
but
its
not
bad
had
on
tap
at
my
local
bar
yellowgolden
body
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
lasting
creamy
white
head
smells
of
light
flowers
a
hint
of
honey
with
a
touch
of
candied
sugar
taste
is
midbodied
with
a
flowing
honey
sweetness
a
fringe
of
malts
and
husks
with
a
light
backing
of
hay
and
hop
citrus
a
solid
drinker
actually
that
went
down
pretty
easy
give
it
a
try
d
decent
drinkable
though
the
honey
character
did
start
getting
to
me
after
one
bottle
ill
stick
to
their
white
ale
even
if
this
seasonal
comes
out
again
12

on
the

clear

showing
decent

bubbles
rising
and
leaving
better
then
moderate

sugary
tropical

the
problems
begin
here
when
it
is
consumed
slightly
metalic
and
bland
brew
where
is
the
wheat
yeast
and
flavor
honey
orange
spice
pass
this
one
by
boycott
macros
trying
to
look
micro
the
regular
blue
moon
wit
is
5
times
better
then
this
lame
offering
eric
recommended
ho
hum
in
a
pinch
i
might
pick
this
up
if
need
be
but
only
expect
to
semienjoy
it
if
its
icecold
this
one
stinks
if
its
warmed
up
even
a
few
degrees
above
40
the
original
blue
moon
is
better
and
yeah
dont
expect
a
witbier
as
listed
here
blue
moon
honey
moon
summer
ale
is
a
big
disappointment
at
one
time
the
original
blue
moon
was
my
highest
scoring
macro
so
i
had
every
right
to
expect
that
this
beer
would
be
of
similar
quality
instead
i
find
myself
recommending
a
complete
overhaul
this
honeymoon
was
over
before
it
even
began
this
beer
was
not
to
thin
and
definitely
not
something
to
fill
you
up
just
a
safe
compromise
and
a
real
treat
to
beat
the
summer
heat
drank
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
boat
it
was
cold
it
was
refreshing
thicker
than
the
regular
blue
moon
more
syrupy
but
also
has
a
saving
grace
of
some
dryness
to
offset
that
thickness
its
a
nice
enough
summery
drink
pedestrian
but
not
bad
blue
moons
honey
moon
summer
ale
pours
a
clear
yellow
gold
body
beneath
a
full
head
of
bright
white
foam
the
head
retention
is
good
and
it
leaves
some
nice
lace
at
the
outset
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
honeyish
and
sweetly
malty
subtly
chalky
with
yeast
delicately
fruity
and
floral
its
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
a
dextrinous
edge
and
median
finebubbled
carbonation
honey
returns
in
the
flavor
but
its
also
distinctly
wheaty
and
a
touch
chalky
its
sweetish
but
not
overdone
and
finishes
drying
theres
enough
body
and
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
giving
it
a
decent
amount
of
drinkability
ok
this
is
not
a
witbier
it
is
golden
and
transparent
and
smells
like
honey
the
taste
is
very
yeasty
with
the
honey
not
coming
through
until
the
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
faint
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
pumpkin
which
is
less
apparent
in
the
taste
all
in
all
this
is
a
refreshing
and
drinkable
summer
ale
a
nice
summer
quaffer
worth
visiting
once
a
summer
especially
after
today
where
the
temp
reached
90
f
here
for
the
first
time
this
springsummer
the
wife
gf
chic
in
your
life
would
more
than
likely
find
this
agreeable
too
worth
a
try
drinkable
yes
good
use
of
a
well
balanced
honey
flavor
good
summer
sunshine
brew
drinkable
nothing
spectacular
nothing
i
would
hunt
down
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
everyone
seems
to
be
taking
a
stab
on
what
beer
style
this
is
i
vote
for
pale
wheat
a
lackluster
style
with
timid
wheat
additions
enough
to
pull
it
above
a
blonde
but
not
enough
to
impart
any
meaningful
character
or
atributes
a
lightly
hazed
canary
hue
with
an
abundance
of
carbonation
just
enough
wheat
to
keep
the
brew
from
being
fizzy
the
smell
and
flavor
are
a
blend
of
pilsner
malt
cereal
grains
and
lemongrass
makes
for
a
modestly
pleasant
yet
unoffensive
brew
the
lack
of
direction
makes
this
beer
bland
and
uneventful
a
watery
finish
and
astringent
lemon
hop
lingering
becomes
tealike
late
not
bad
but
not
a
wit
refreshing
due
to
some
tight
effervescent
carbonation
and
a
pleasing
little
bite
well
balanced
unfortunately
that
is
not
much
of
a
compliment
because
this
beer
is
pretty
barebones
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
nothing
special
d
fairly
good
beer
pretty
drinkable
addendum
this
has
been
chewing
on
me
all
day
and
i
finally
have
the
taste
of
this
nailed
this
tastes
exactly
like
cinnamon
roll
with
orange
frosting
serve
this
at
a
brunch
with
one
of
those
and
watch
the
look
on
peoples
faces
d
this
is
okay
but
it
tastes
nothing
like
a
witbier
id
rather
drink
a
regular
blue
moon
than
this
one
poured
into
my
rare
vos
glass
very
active
carbonation
rises
quickly
through
the
golden
yellow
liquid
very
slight
haze
almost
a
retentive
head
but
eventually
the
head
falls
behind
the
carbonation
and
leaves
a
ring
not
really
enjoying
the
smell
of
this
one
it
has
that
skunked
hefeweisen
cardboard
smell
other
than
that
wet
wheat
and
mild
hops
not
quite
sure
what
to
make
of
the
taste
a
sugarysweet
burst
of
artificial
honey
flavor
at
the
very
beginning
falling
to
a
sharp
stale
wheat
beer
taste
metallic
aftertaste
i
dont
mind
blue
moon
so
how
did
they
screw
it
up
so
much
just
by
putting
fake
honey
in
it
this
is
the
first
and
will
be
the
last
6er
i
buy
of
this
stuff
overall
impression
im
not
a
big
fan
of
honey
beers
but
this
one
isnt
too
bad
drinkable
nice
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
to
keep
it
interesting
not
really
a
whitbier
at
all
but
its
still
interesting
a
bit
hoppier
than
i
would
like
for
a
beer
of
this
style
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
i
would
hardly
consider
getting
this
regularly
this
is
is
not
for
me
might
be
interesting
to
have
one
if
you
are
into
honey
beers
but
bottom
line
there
are
too
many
other
summer
beers
out
there
even
for
a
light
summer
brew
this
one
just
doesnt
have
enough
to
it
overall
another
pleasant
surprise
from
blue
mooncoors
tasty
and
enjoyable
suitable
for
warm
summer
days
not
incredible
but
certainly
enjoyable
worth
a
try
overall
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
macro
drinkers
will
like
it
more
than
craft
beer
enthusiasts
personally
i
think
the
regular
blue
moon
is
better
made
beer
but
this
is
ok
bad
offering
from
blue
moon
this
is
not
a
good
summer
beer
or
a
good
beer
in
general
sorry
but
unexciting
to
me
not
a
bad
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
which
is
what
i
had
it
on
so
maybe
im
alil
bias
i
love
blue
moons
belgian
white
but
this
one
tasted
nothing
like
it
so
im
surprised
they
considered
it
a
witbier
the
honey
after
taste
was
really
good
and
made
the
beer
worth
the
6pack
buy
but
i
had
a
very
high
expectation
and
it
didnt
live
up
to
it
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
right
for
it
for
a
summer
get
together
the
taste
is
mild
bready
grain
with
honey
mellow
not
overpowering
with
a
peppery
spicy
note
and
a
slight
grassy
note
at
the
finish
mildly
sweet
drying
out
slightly
at
the
end
light
and
easily
drinkable
poured
a
straw
yellow
into
a
tall
glass
little
head
retention
or
maybe
just
my
glasss
fault
who
knows
however
not
impressed
altogether
with
this
particular
brew
maybe
its
the
slight
sourness
that
i
am
not
very
fond
of
that
makes
me
think
this
way
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
then
again
i
think
that
every
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
one
regardless
i
am
surprised
that
my
local
grocery
store
actually
had
it
this
pours
a
yellow
straw
color
with
a
minimal
head
and
some
lacing
it
appears
slightly
hazy
it
smells
of
slight
citrus
and
a
hint
of
hops
and
some
sourness
it
tastes
fairly
refreshing
as
a
summer
beer
should
i
detect
a
slight
honey
flavor
and
some
bitterness
from
either
hops
or
orange
peel
it
is
a
slightly
bitter
beer
with
not
much
flavoring
hopsthey
let
the
honey
malt
and
orange
peel
take
care
of
that
not
much
body
to
it
as
expected
and
overall
not
a
bad
beer
from
a
big
company
i
wouldnt
mind
having
some
on
a
golf
course
d
this
is
what
they
should
be
brewing
in
place
of
regular
blue
moon
totally
quaffable
intersting
and
the
pinnacle
of
crossover
beers
for
macro
drinkers
may
not
be
a
witbier
by
the
strictist
definition
but
i
like
it
highly
recommended
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
i
guess
but
the
dryness
isnt
what
i
am
after
in
a
summer
ale
ill
probably
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
i
think
there
are
as
good
or
better
summer
ales
out
there
and
some
like
henry
weinhards
at
a
lower
price
d
its
not
for
everybody
it
is
certainly
very
sweet
and
not
your
typical
ale
this
would
be
very
appropriate
for
the
herbedspiced
beer
category
i
liked
it
but
many
will
not
its
decent
stuff
and
id
buy
it
again
no
problem
ehhh
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
bottle
into
tulip
glass
a
very
light
almost
like
a
macro
rice
lager
but
its
saved
a
bit
by
the
nice
golden
hue
head
went
away
very
quickly
s
not
much
aside
from
the
honey
and
the
wheat
the
citrus
is
pretty
much
in
the
background
t
like
the
smell
a
lot
of
honey
and
wheat
with
some
citrus
a
little
thin
but
pretty
pleasant
not
much
hop
character
but
a
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
m
moderate
to
low
carbonation
pretty
smooth
d
a
good
thirst
quencher
for
the
summer
but
not
anything
to
go
crazy
over
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
d
yes
i
could
drink
this
as
a
regular
hot
day
burp
beer
so
maybe
it
scores
better
than
coors
but
as
its
style
a
weak
choice
ordinary
blue
moon
is
a
reasonably
tasty
wit
better
tasting
than
some
actual
belgian
examples
but
this
effort
is
pretty
bland
and
mostly
uninteresting
light
yellow
translucent
body
with
a
couple
inches
of
white
head
that
takes
a
little
while
to
dissipate
and
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
slightly
lemmony
and
peppery
with
a
hint
of
honey
tastes
sweet
like
honey
hints
of
citrus
in
the
background
light
bodied
but
by
no
means
watery
very
drinkable
not
much
wrong
with
this
one
though
its
a
bit
simplistic
an
easydrinking
beer
for
a
hot
day
not
recommended
unless
you
specifically
light
honey
brews
much
better
than
a
mikes
hard
and
preferred
to
leinenkugels
summer
shandy
but
not
up
to
the
standards
of
duponts
biere
de
miel
d
this
is
a
decent
cheap
beer
from
blue
moon
not
great
not
horrible
good
flavors
and
goes
down
easy
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
sept
07
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
slightly
pale
yellow
color
i
gave
a
hard
pour
and
got
a
pretty
big
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
good
carb
with
slight
lacing
the
aroma
was
punch
in
the
face
honey
with
a
slight
hint
of
orange
peel
in
the
back
the
taste
was
also
dominated
by
honey
i
think
i
would
have
liked
this
is
it
had
been
a
beer
with
some
honey
highlights
since
i
love
honey
but
this
is
basically
a
glass
of
honey
with
a
little
beer
thrown
in
to
make
it
flow
out
of
the
glass
better
by
the
end
the
honey
is
just
too
much
to
take
and
i
had
to
choke
down
the
last
third
just
to
avoid
a
drain
pour
avoid
this
one
1
5
na
ml
n
wait
isnt
witbier
supposed
to
be
you
know
wit
and
maybe
opaque
this
isntits
a
translucent
sickly
yellow
color
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
bubbles
nicely
for
a
while
smells
vaguely
of
honey
but
im
not
sure
i
would
have
picked
up
on
it
without
being
told
tastes
a
little
more
like
honey
and
average
pale
lager
type
beer
has
a
pretty
nice
refreshing
mouthfeelsomewhere
between
spring
and
summer
if
you
know
what
i
mean
despite
having
very
little
to
recommend
it
i
could
actually
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
thats
about
all
its
good
for
though
appearance
is
a
light
orange
with
a
quick
fizzy
head
smell
is
clean
with
light
honey
and
orange
taste
of
the
honey
is
prevalent
giving
it
a
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
orange
and
having
a
good
balance
with
hops
and
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
but
thick
overall
its
better
than
what
was
to
be
expected
it
would
make
for
a
good
session
but
the
sweetness
would
prevent
me
to
continue
beyond
23
beers
d
this
beer
is
tasty
but
very
sweet
a
great
adaptation
on
a
wheat
beer
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
given
the
chance
d
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
those
who
like
sweet
flavors
for
me
this
sweetness
could
be
very
annoying
after
one
or
two
this
is
worth
trying
and
i
think
some
people
might
really
like
this
but
its
not
for
me
the
only
reason
i
even
rated
this
was
to
get
a
true
list
of
beers
ive
tired
overall
yeah
a
basic
american
pale
wheat
ale
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
it
feels
like
seltzer
water
too
and
the
best
i
can
say
is
that
at
least
its
crisp
even
that
tingle
falls
off
in
the
end
the
feel
is
lighy
and
crisp
with
more
than
moderate
carbonation
it
has
a
certain
thinness
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
i
enjoy
blondes
in
the
spring
as
well
as
brunettes
ravens
redheads
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
brassgold
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
wheat
a
kiss
of
grass
and
a
vague
sense
of
citrus
fruits
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
everything
coming
through
a
touch
brighter
and
simultaneously
a
touch
blander
as
though
everything
were
interpenetrating
everything
else
to
such
a
degree
that
the
pieces
are
increasingly
difficult
to
parse
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
an
okay
brew
nothing
ill
overtly
insult
but
nothing
ill
drink
again
on
purpose
o
im
not
exactly
sure
why
the
other
reviews
slam
this
beer
that
badly
its
a
little
bland
and
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
its
not
really
terrible
either
am
i
buying
it
again
no
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
one
if
someone
offered
i
respectfully
dissent
o
i
just
dont
get
how
people
buy
this
stuff
it
is
flavorless
and
just
doesnt
feel
like
beer
to
me
ill
never
try
this
again
o
highly
drinkable
alternative
to
a
light
beer
certainly
works
as
an
accompaniment
to
yard
work
and
summer
weather
not
much
flavor
or
aroma
here
but
no
striking
flaws
in
this
refreshing
brew
overall
not
much
change
from
the
blue
moon
base
beer
but
the
change
hurts
drinkability
and
adds
little
elsewhere
overall
great
tasting
spring
ale
very
close
to
a
summe
beer
because
of
how
easy
drinking
it
is
the
little
bit
of
flavor
really
makes
this
beer
stand
out
o
my
expectations
werent
that
high
but
i
must
admit
i
was
a
tad
disappointed
the
citrus
and
orange
notes
were
barely
detectable
and
the
cereal
malts
were
overwhelming
this
was
more
reminiscent
of
a
light
adjunct
than
a
flavoured
wheat
ale
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
this
again
this
is
a
rather
poor
offering
from
the
blue
moon
line
its
one
dimensional
and
offers
little
besides
grains
avoid
overall
i
think
this
beer
hits
the
mark
for
a
slightly
more
interesting
take
on
something
like
a
coors
light
etc
this
is
not
an
epic
beer
or
a
complex
beer
but
i
think
for
a
day
on
the
golf
course
this
beer
would
be
great
rjt
mouthfeel
could
barely
feel
my
mouth
due
to
excessive
carbonation
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
talking
rain
tainted
with
malt
liquor
overall
this
is
a
dumbed
down
version
of
a
wheat
ale
that
has
very
little
redeeming
virtue
to
it
quenching
yes
satisfying
no
weak
obvious
pours
a
transparent
straw
color
with
negligble
head
in
spite
of
the
vigorous
carbonation
aroma
is
bare
and
unappealing
mouthfeel
is
perky
on
account
of
the
carbonation
but
the
flavor
is
thin
and
watery
tasting
of
dilute
massproduced
wheat
flavoring
and
mild
cleaning
solvent
this
tastes
almost
like
a
coors
light
but
with
less
purpose
or
identity
one
of
the
most
watered
down
beers
ive
tasted
and
utterly
forgetable
if
not
for
its
inadequacy
sweeter
and
fruitier
than
the
runofthemill
light
lager
but
i
can
see
the
beer
finding
favor
in
the
lover
of
those
lagers
who
seek
a
more
summery
tone
poured
from
bottle
stamped
jul0912
to
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
12
finger
white
head
with
little
retention
or
lacing
looks
average
really
the
smells
follows
suit
as
there
isnt
much
to
report
a
hint
of
wheat
malt
but
thats
about
it
the
flavor
also
is
dominated
by
a
strong
wheat
malt
character
too
much
so
little
in
terms
of
hop
character
or
bitterness
really
there
isnt
much
aside
from
wheat
adequately
carbonated
and
light
bodied
overall
this
is
just
an
average
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
id
easily
pass
on
this
again
though
it
is
easy
to
put
down
due
to
minimal
taste
lol
o
this
is
a
beer
is
just
a
tad
above
average
to
me
maybe
not
something
i
would
rush
out
to
buy
but
i
think
i
would
have
it
again
overall
this
beer
is
average
to
me
the
smell
and
taste
are
not
memorable
the
beer
is
not
that
strong
5
4
but
i
think
it
is
smooth
finishing
and
has
some
flavor
to
it
would
not
recommend
on
a
night
out
with
friends
but
i
am
not
going
to
thrown
it
under
the
bus
driver
from
new
jersey
either
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
stamped
jul0912co5101620
sampled
on
march

2012
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
the
way
it
looks
with
its
golden
yellow
color
busy
carbonation
clear
clarity
and
small
head
beyond
that
the
aroma
is
rather
bland
with
a
biscutilike
character
and
little
else
the
body
is
about
right
for
the
style
as
it
falls
into
the
lightmedium
range
the
taste
is
also
biscuitlike
with
a
slightly
bitter
ending
i
think
it
could
have
been
better
overall
the
beer
has
a
nice
flavor
but
for
the
most
part
is
rather
one
dimensional
its
refreshing
and
one
for
a
hot
day
perhaps
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
citrus
notes
taste
is
crisp
mild
slightly
tart
some
wheat
and
lemon
not
exactly
bursting
with
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
mediocre
beer
o
this
is
a
an
okay
wheat
ale
there
is
nothing
to
make
it
stand
out
appears
a
very
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
disappearing
soda
head
which
is
sort
of
the
exact
opposite
of
what
i
expect
on
top
of
a
wheat
ale
texture
is
very
thin
and
watery
at
least
the
carbonation
is
lively
but
again
that
reinforces
the
soda
notion
in
my
head
smells
very
much
like
the
lemonorange
medicinal
oily
aroma
from
a
wetnap
that
has
been
soaking
in
a
glass
of
diluted
tonic
water
seriously
it
actually
does
smell
like
that
flavor
is
thankfully
a
lot
blander
than
the
nose
would
have
you
believe
coming
across
as
a
sort
of
generic
ghost
of
a
wheat
malt
mixed
with
mushy
stale
oyster
crackers
and
a
twist
of
citrus
ill
be
avoiding
this
one
in
the
future
this
brew
pours
a
very
clear
and
light
gold
with
a
tight
thin
white
head
that
amounts
to
some
decent
lacing
a
grainy
nose
is
met
with
a
little
wheat
aromas
and
the
barest
hints
of
orange
and
lemon
the
flavor
profile
is
much
of
the
same
with
grainy
husklike
malt
blending
with
slight
wheat
orange
and
lemon
notes
a
mediumhigh
amount
of
carbonation
rounds
out
this
light
bodied
ale
after
the
great
caramel
maltiness
of
the
full
moon
winter
seasonal
this
spring
release
leaves
the
pallet
refreshed
and
renewed
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
to
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
grain
and
wheat
with
not
too
much
else
going
on
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
little
bit
of
grain
and
orange
citrus
going
on
i
also
get
some
other
citrus
but
it
is
fairly
faint
medium
mouthfeeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
palate
doesnt
live
up
at
first
there
is
a
fresh
citrus
but
then
a
macrolager
blandness
washes
across
teh
palate
lemony
zing
tries
to
dance
on
the
tongue
in
the
finish
but
is
weighted
doen
by
an
american
macrolager
sweet
adjunct
malty
effect
weirdyet
in
th
eend
its
pretty
refreshing
not
bad
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
would
prefer
a
regular
blue
moon
over
this
overall
i
think
this
beer
would
be
a
lot
better
in
the
summer
but
i
do
enjoy
it
quite
a
bit
o
average
at
best
this
might
be
the
worst
iteration
of
blue
moon
ive
had
its
just
not
good
i
handed
this
to
my
wife
blindly
and
her
evaluation
was
it
tastes
like
wheat
and
coors
light
i
could
not
have
said
it
better
myself
o
while
this
beer
does
lack
flavor
the
flavor
it
does
has
tastes
good
and
accomplishes
being
a
refreshing
spring
beer
i
detect
mostly
just
light
wheat
lemon
peel
and
carbonated
water
and
although
it
is
simple
its
much
more
tasty
refreshing
and
pleasant
than
a
regular
blue
moon
o
wheres
the
wheat
a
blonde
ale
perhaps
and
a
poor
one
at
that
coors
should
have
stuck
with
rising
moon
and
maybe
played
with
the
malts
or
yeast
a
bit
this
brew
is
practically
a
a
bud
light
lime
in
sheeps
clothing
overall
disappointing
considering
the
brewery
but
not
terrible
overall
hit
or
miss
o
its
an
inbetween
brew
that
doesnt
try
to
be
what
it
isnt
its
a
spring
time
wheat
ale
and
nothing
more
while
i
feel
that
sam
adams
white
ale
is
a
better
brew
for
the
style
this
one
isnt
too
bad
its
a
brew
that
true
beer
lovers
would
drink
at
a
grill
out
and
one
that
light
beer
drinkers
wouldnt
turn
down
crystal
clear
tight
head
settles
to
nothing
no
lace
citrus
and
light
grain
nose
light
crisp
lemony
taste
with
a
dry
wheat
finish
theres
something
else
there
i
cant
quite
place
but
it
doesnt
taste
good
thin
and
fizzy
almost
a
drain
pour
overall
this
was
very
solid
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
not
something
i
would
shy
away
from
very
nicely
done
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
clear
yellow
body
to
it
with
nothing
of
a
head
to
it
but
a
thin
lace
that
you
can
barely
see
the
only
thing
i
smell
is
a
little
bit
of
citrus
and
some
hints
of
wheat
i
get
a
sweet
taste
and
citrus
at
the
same
time
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
is
where
the
little
bit
of
malt
gets
me
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
overall
not
a
good
beer
but
i
would
drink
it
over
a
bmc
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
not
so
good
really
and
even
a
slight
step
down
from
the
previous
rising
moon
ill
give
it
3
0
overall
only
because
its
decently
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
in
the
way
a
cold
glass
of
water
is
and
there
arent
any
off
or
bad
tastes
theres
just
barely
any
taste
period
o
nothing
flawed
but
nothing
really
sets
the
beer
apart
served
from
refrigerator
temperature
into
goblet
pours
dark
golden
with
small
head
which
dissipates
quickly
flavor
is
of
malt
and
some
sort
of
hops
which
i
cant
identify
flavor
is
of
separate
malt
and
hops
which
arent
really
well
mixed
neither
is
initially
overpowering
but
it
isnt
a
single
package
after
a
while
though
the
malt
begins
to
dominate
overall
this
is
a
very
generic
beer
more
flavourful
then
most
massmarkets
but
you
can
do
better
interesting
looking
beer
here
the
body
looks
nothing
like
a
wheat
ale
not
cloudy
at
all
completely
transparent
it
looks
like
a
lager
i
doubt
there
is
any
wheat
in
here
at
all
the
head
on
the
other
hand
is
really
nice
frothy
and
about
one
finger
in
length
but
of
course
it
is
almost
gone
now
the
head
is
totally
white
and
the
body
like
i
said
looks
like
a
lager
golden
in
color
the
appearance
overall
is
nothing
impressive
on
the
smell
you
pretty
much
just
get
that
generic
beer
smell
almost
no
other
smells
there
at
all
there
is
a
small
hint
of
lemon
but
thats
about
it
no
hops
small
malt
character
and
no
wheat
the
smell
is
pretty
freaking
lame
wow
thats
not
good
i
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
to
be
this
bad
probably
the
most
boring
blue
moon
ive
ever
had
which
is
saying
a
lot
there
really
isnt
anything
to
it
there
is
that
small
lemon
flavor
i
picked
up
on
the
smell
and
then
that
generic
beer
taste
there
are
basically
no
hops
in
here
and
very
little
malt
there
is
a
slight
slight
feel
of
wheat
which
just
might
keep
the
taste
above
a
2
other
than
that
there
really
isnt
much
to
speak
of
as
for
mouthfeel
its
ok
because
of
that
small
amount
of
wheat
but
pretty
crappy
overall
drinkability
is
ok
because
its
so
light
but
still
nothing
special
there
its
only
redeeming
factor
is
the
fact
that
its
refreshing
thats
about
it
other
than
that
not
a
good
beer
overall
they
really
missed
the
mark
on
this
one
it
does
have
a
strong
wheat
taste
but
it
is
going
to
be
a
struggle
to
finish
even
a
pint
of
this
blue
moon
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
anything
they
try
to
brew
otherwise
honey
moon
this
spring
ale
etc
turns
out
very
rough
to
drink
and
missing
many
qualities
of
making
it
a
decent
ale
this
this
is
a
wheat
beer
of
some
sort
theres
nothing
appearancewise
to
seperate
this
from
macro
lager
52
clear
golden
color
three
fingers
of
white
dense
head
that
quickly
fades
all
that
stuff
the
aroma
ugh
no
how
does
this
smell
so
awful
its
basically
just
a
supercheap
aroma
hints
of
wheat
pledge
and
something
that
might
have
once
passed
for
hops
the
taste
on
this
corn
honey
stickysweetness
its
passable
but
just
barely
i
wouldnt
really
like
another
the
mouthfeel
is
thankfully
thin
and
the
drinkability
is
alright
this
is
not
a
good
beer
this
is
not
a
good
beer
at
all
im
fairly
fond
of
the
base
blue
moon
and
pale
moon
is
alright
but
their
seasonals
arent
really
all
that
great
overall
this
beer
seems
like
just
a
bad
version
of
blue
moon
to
me
the
taste
is
nothing
you
havent
tasted
before
so
therefore
its
not
really
a
beer
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
poured
a
pale
straw
color
with
little
head
on
it
smell
is
faint
wheat
and
malt
taste
is
average
kinda
weak
not
a
lot
of
wheat
taste
tastes
cheap
very
light
bodied
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
just
nothing
to
it
not
worth
the
price
at
all
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
o
ok
falls
a
bit
short
perhaps
a
nice
beer
when
your
hot
and
you
want
it
to
go
down
quick
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
no
retention
and
golden
color
with
filtered
clarity
aroma
is
wheat
malt
with
none
of
the
promised
citrus
to
speak
of
flavor
is
clean
light
and
has
a
pleasant
graininess
with
very
little
lemon
or
orange
as
promised
light
mouthfeel
and
generous
co2
overall
a
very
bland
ordinary
beer
as
far
as
weissbeirs
go
this
is
not
anything
special
the
mouthfeel
is
reminiscent
of
pbr
or
mgd
not
how
a
wheat
beer
should
taste
the
beer
has
little
to
no
body
to
it
the
only
redeeming
characteristic
of
this
beer
is
the
smell
of
course
that
could
just
be
the
lemon
i
added
to
it
to
make
it
tolerable
not
as
bad
as
a
domestic
lager
but
not
worth
the
price
considering
that
it
goes
for
the
same
as
a
sam
adams
or
equivalent
microbrew
this
thing
shouldnt
carry
the
blue
moon
name
it
should
carry
its
fathers
name
coors
this
is
what
i
pictured
bl
wheat
would
taste
like
decent
but
i
probably
wont
purchase
again
with
the
better
keweenaw
bay
pick
axe
blonde
cheaper
and
brewed
closer
light
body
and
somewhat
flat
not
at
all
crisp
or
refreshing
or
anything
it
aims
to
be
all
around
horrible
pretty
bad
really
even
for
coors
d
bad
taste
and
its
a
waste
of
money
wow
cant
believe
i
spent
7
99
a
sixer
for
this
trash
someone
should
be
ashamed
weak
sauce
i
expected
a
bit
more
out
of
this
one
not
much
to
it
at
all
and
the
addition
of
citrus
fails
imo
they
would
have
been
better
off
sticking
to
their
rising
moon
spring
ale
and
simply
tweaking
as
i
said
d
doesnt
drink
poorly
the
more
i
had
it
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
but
the
flavors
are
on
the
weaker
side
with
that
damn
offputting
aroma
kinda
dissapointed
i
have
3
more
of
these
in
the
brewmasters
pack
i
just
bought
definitely
would
not
buy
again
was
very
dissappointed
in
the
generic
and
mediocre
nature
of
this
offering
reminded
me
of
bud
light
wheat
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
light
body
high
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
poor
i
normally
try
to
cut
blue
moon
stuff
a
bit
of
slack
but
i
cant
on
this
one
it
is
what
it
is
a
weak
imitation
of
a
better
hefeweizen
it
is
a
decent
effort
but
could
use
more
work
to
be
honest
it
could
be
worse
though
overallso
much
for
that
orange
peel
seems
like
imitation
craft
gimmickry
again
blue
moon
drowned
in
oj
to
me
not
many
beers
i
despise
this
seems
to
be
one
of
them
overall
i
would
not
recommend
buying
this
beer
but
if
you
find
it
in
you
refridgerator
not
a
bad
offering
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
initially
a
good
sized
white
head
head
fades
quickly
smells
of
lemon
orange
and
grass
very
grainy
flavored
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
sharp
lemonorange
flavors
with
some
grassy
hops
the
hops
are
faint
but
they
are
there
which
suprises
me
a
bit
light
bodied
in
the
mouth
not
a
great
beer
but
not
a
bad
one
either
considering
the
brewer
overall
this
was
a
pretty
mundane
brew
when
i
think
of
spring
beers
i
think
of
hops
and
this
tasted
like
it
didnt
have
any
and
relied
on
the
citrus
for
its
bitterness
but
it
didnt
do
the
trick
this
might
hit
the
spot
after
that
first
lawn
mowing
session
of
the
year
but
other
then
that
its
a
one
trick
pony
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
incredibly
unremarkable
i
will
take
normal
blue
moon
before
this
easily
wont
be
picking
this
one
up
again
id
rather
just
have
a
blue
moon
and
thats
saying
a
lot
thick
white
head
and
decent
retention
minimal
lacing
crystal
gold
body
extreme
floral
and
grassy
scent
smells
like
the
el
paso
desert
in
the
spring
with
a
touch
of
womens
perfume
and
soap
sweet
hints
of
corn
and
hops
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
goes
right
down
without
a
trace
not
watery
or
full
bodied
just
a
balanced
mouthfeel
that
would
go
great
with
food
pairings
since
it
doesnt
put
a
load
on
the
palate
depending
on
your
mood
you
might
mistake
it
for
bland
floral
corny
aftertaste
with
crispness
that
eventually
fades
and
lets
the
stickiness
show
my
main
beef
with
this
beer
is
that
its
a
called
a
wheat
ale
but
has
none
of
the
characteristics
one
would
be
hoping
for
when
shopping
for
one
pretty
weak
for
a
wheat
ale
poured
into
a
tumbler
the
head
reaches
the
top
and
dissipates
very
quickly
orangey
yellow
body
smells
yeasty
sour
citrusy
and
a
little
appley
the
taste
is
grain
dominated
with
hop
bitterness
very
thin
a
little
gassy
overall
not
too
pleasant
extremely
disappointing
beer
idk
why
it
is
priced
at
where
it
is
especially
since
this
tastes
kind
of
like
a
miller
light
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
orange
overall
really
disappointed
and
needs
more
flavor
like
their
other
seasonal
fall
and
winter
beers
dlike
most
of
the
blue
moon
beers
this
is
pretty
drinkable
not
alot
to
say
about
it
it
is
what
it
is
has
a
slightly
above
average
taste
smell
is
grainy
pours
yellow
smells
wheaty
taste
sort
of
seems
like
it
attempts
to
get
interesting
but
then
it
falls
flat
leaving
more
flavors
of
wheat
and
not
enough
of
the
more
interesting
notes
that
almost
make
it
taste
like
a
belgian
blonde
it
however
is
crisp
which
is
good
it
doesnt
have
alot
though
going
for
it
to
make
it
interesting
just
a
bit
more
good
then
bad
though
making
it
drinkable
this
company
should
stop
they
should
stop
making
new
kinds
of
beer
and
they
should
stop
creating
attractive
names
and
label
art
for
their
crap
product
this
beer
smells
like
corn
and
7up
it
taste
like
soupy
adjuncts
loads
of
creamed
corn
and
artificial
lime
flavor
nothing
resembling
a
wheat
beer
if
they
hadnt
filtered
it
had
some
hop
character
or
tasted
like
anything
besideds
coors
light
with
skittles
it
would
be
an
improvement
verdict
slightly
disappointed
in
terms
of
spring
beers
after
having
samuel
adams
noble
pils
and
then
having
this
follow
it
up
i
really
enjoy
the
heavy
floral
and
lime
taste
but
there
isnt
too
much
else
going
on
for
the
beer
clean
and
crisp
this
makes
for
a
good
warm
weather
beer
not
too
much
to
ponder
here
when
its
said
all
and
done
d
not
bad
it
is
certainly
quaffable
but
i
have
a
hard
time
coming
up
with
a
reason
why
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
there
is
nothing
particularly
offensive
here
but
aside
from
some
bland
coriander
character
there
isnt
any
real
character
at
all
not
really
worth
the
effort
of
twisting
off
the
cap
atmosphere
is
okay
appearance
is
not
much
to
speak
of
nose
is
not
bad
grain
and
lime
flavor
is
a
fair
combination
of
grain
citrus
and
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
d
even
for
the
style
this
isnt
a
very
enjoyable
beer
coors
filtered
out
any
good
flavors
that
could
have
been
there
the
only
reason
to
get
this
is
if
like
me
are
currently
in
a
beer
waste
land
and
want
to
try
something
new
smooth
but
light
feel
and
drink
and
drinks
more
like
and
viewed
as
an
american
blonde
ale
rather
than
an
apwa
as
the
contribution
of
the
wheat
malt
is
minor
for
this
brew
but
then
the
body
is
light
as
well
pretty
generic
ok
well
i
feel
a
little
jipped
by
this
beer
wheat
beer
typically
is
cloudy
and
this
beer
was
as
crystal
clear
as
a
mountain
stream
that
was
a
little
odd
the
smell
was
nothing
special
and
then
when
i
tasted
it
it
was
like
a
regular
american
light
beer
normally
i
like
bluemoon
as
a
goto
beer
cause
most
places
have
it
if
you
go
out
to
eat
and
it
makes
for
a
good
replacement
for
a
boring
old
coors
light
with
a
meal
the
blonde
wheat
however
tasted
just
like
a
run
of
the
mill
boring
american
style
beer
not
a
thing
to
get
excited
about
this
was
okay
as
with
all
blue
moon
products
theyre
what
i
go
to
when
theres
no
really
good
microbrewery
option
available
nothing
too
impressive
but
not
awful
either
id
call
the
beer
average
pretty
drinkable
but
i
think
its
really
caused
by
the
lack
of
a
bold
flavor
or
something
to
that
extent
sessionable
but
i
usually
go
for
bolder
richer
drinks
so
im
probably
not
going
to
be
quick
on
buying
more
d
wont
have
too
much
trouble
finishing
a
6er
but
wont
be
rushing
out
for
another
i
hope
coors
is
smart
enough
to
produce
this
into
the
early
summer
where
it
belongs
until
then
youd
be
better

in

overall
drinkability
isnt
anything
to
write

about
its
actually
hard
to
drink
more
so
than
any
golden
beer
should
ever
be
d
i
am
note
usually
a
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
so
is
water
doesnt
come
across
as
refreshing
or
pleasant
not
something
i
would
reach
for
again
i
havent
had
a
regular
blue
moon
in
many
years
but
my
recollection
is
that
is
a
better
beer
the
2nd
one
that
was
left
in
the
fridge
will
be
served
to
someone
who
doesnt
like

d
much
much
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
the
flavors
are
pretty
good
but
the
overbearing
sweetness
of
the
beer
kills
it
for
me
drink
i
grew
up
in
colorado
and
admit
to
having
peed
in
the
tubing
river
that
coors
uses
for
their
beer
that
said
i
very
much
dislike
the
company
but
thought
that
this
was
a
very
good
session
beer
sorry
for
peeing
in
your
river
coors
not
phenomenal
tasting
and
very
smooth
yet
refreshing
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
tastes
nothing
like
honey
theres
a
fruity
flavor
present
like
peaches
overall
hugely
disappointing
this
is
a
very
poorly
made
brew
my
buddy
left
some
of
these
in
my
beer
fridge
so
drinking
them
was
better
then
throwing
them
away
lol
not
much
of
a
wheat
beer
the
honey
and
some
citrus
is
there
not
much
of
a
head
maybe
more
complex
than
a
regular
blue
moon
but
not
special
i
thought
this
was
a
surprisingly
tasty
beer
especially
because
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
hey
not
really
all
that
bad
but
with
most
of
these
blue
moons
price
point
is
too
high
better
beer
for
less
nothing
special
but
it
is
refreshing
i
was
expecting
something
like
a
leinenkugel
summer
wheat
but
was
hugely
disappointed
all
i
could
taste
was
honey
and
hops
with
no
substantial
wheat
flavor
it
was
hard
for
me
to
finish
it
the
younger
folk
at
the
neighborhood
party
seems
to
enjoy
it
much
more
than
i
did
after
a
16
hour
workday
it
really
hits
the
spot
definitely
alongside
a
burger
and
some
bacon
d
the
unfiltered
taste
on
the
tongue
is
just
like
fuck
yeah
its
smooth
has
a
full
flavor
and
i
always
end
up
heading
to
the
fridge
to
grab
a
second
one
d
overall
pleasing
in
taste
this
makes
a
decent
summer
beer
similar
to
grainbelt
or
leinenkugels
honey
weiss
tastes
almost
exactly
like
a
regular
blue
moon
except
a
little
more
of
a
wheat
flavor
and
a
n
overwhelming
honey
flavor
that
i
just
didnt
care
for
its
like
someone
grabbed
a
bottle
of
honey
and
mixed
it
with
a
blue
moon
it
just
isnt
a
good
combination
poured
from
bottle
into
glass
appearance
is
a
strong
wheat
color
smell
is
poor
with
the
wheat
and
honey
coming
through
the
taste
is
fairly
bland
with
the
honey
and
wheat
shining
through
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
though
very
good
summer
beer
especially
for
the
price
this
can
be
picked
up
for
compare
to
leinenkugels
honey
weiss
good
summer
beer
overall
still
when
it
comes
down
to
the
macrobrew
belgian
white
wars
i
got
to
side
with
shock
top
for
in
just
two
of
their
beers
i
could
really
taste
their
complexities
and
their
differences
where
both
of
the
blue
moon
offerings
that
should
be
drastically
different
are
quietly
interchangeable
to
a
degree
the
nose
was
weak
and
didnt
reveal
much
but
soft
wheat
honey
apple
and
pear
the
flavor
though
surprised
me
greatly
as
it
was
nicely
balanced
and
appropriately
measured
between
wheat
malt
dryness
honey
sweetness
apple
crispness
and
even
pear
like
freshness
this
is
surprisingly
complex
as
it
is
macrobrewed
and
by
look
and
scent
a
bit
boring
but
the
flavor
delivers
a
nice
bang
for
the
buck
while
i
am
not
a
fan
of
honey
this
beer
was
actually
really
good
it
will
definately
be
enjoyed
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
head
was
very
creamy
looking
with
nice
lace
that
quickly
disappeared
from
the
glass
great
summer
beer
honey
is
not
overwhelming
great
taste
easy
to
drink
will
definitely
get
it
again
ya
know
i
think
ya
just
need
the
right
stuff
at
the
right
time
because
i
knew
what
to
expect
from
this
guy
but
the
very
cold
light
easydrinking
nature
while
i
am
hot
and
sweaty
and
getting
ready
for
the
kings
game
3
just
tasted
pretty
darned
good
i
poured
it
softly
so
i
wouldnt
lose
any
flavor
in
the
head
and
i
certainly
got
the
cornpissadjunct
in
it
but
it
was
okay
okay
for
right
now
otherwise
id
be
urinating
on
the
bottle
just
about
any
other
time
i
would
drink
it
yeah
i
guess
i
can
be
a
snob
but
im
a
fair
one
no
and
as
much
as
i
abhor
that
camel
piss
swill
bud
light
they
have
a
pretty
decent
commercial
theyre
playing
during
the
hockey
playoffs
overall
a
pretty
pointless
brew
in
my
opinion
i
want
to
actually
taste
the
ingredients
not
pound
thin
beer
water
by
the
pool
its
an
average
beer
a
light
hazy
colored
brew
with
white
soapy
froth
aroma
is
sweet
with
lemon
honey
and
bread
in
the
taste
lemon
and
honey
faint
bitterness
does
little
to
stand
in
the
wat
malty
dextrins
light
body
with
a
smooth
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
ok
beer
it
is
refreshing
in
its
ways
not
bad
the
stuff
is
awful
there
is
just
no
other
word
for
it
it
looks
good
but
that
is
where
it
ends
smells
like
stawcornpiss
mixture
nasty
coors
based
yuck
i
guess
it
did
not
help
that
i
drank
a
westy
12
before
this
but
even
if
i
didnt
this
beer
is
the
pits
taste
is
exactly
like
the
smell
is
and
like
if
it
could
actually
get
any
worse
the
taste
goes
down
hill
as
it
warms
and
ends
with
a
genuine
used
toilet
water
taste
i
purchased
a
12
pack
of
the
collection
including
summer
regular
farmhouse
and
the
agave
blond
and
all
of
them
were
equally
disgusting
nasty
beer
the
color
was
different
between
them
all
but
other
than
that
all
taste
nasty
i
just
cant
get
past
that
nasty
wet
liquid
corn
taste
it
is
repulsive
i
am
not
totally
against
coors
as
coors
light
would
rank
a
5
against
this
nastyass
shit
overall
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
but
actually
rather
crisp
and
refreshing
and
a
pretty
easy
going
summer
style
brew
just
what
it
is
meant
to
be
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
head
the
lacing
is
average
and
is
not
well
retained
nose
of
belgian
yeast
over
a
light
honey
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
citrus
almost
medium
bodied
with
a
strong
level
of
carbonation
that
imparts
a
nice
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
that
of
a
classic
wheat
ale
but
is
quite
muted
light
citrus
over
light
honey
with
just
a
barely
noticeable
touch
of
spice
nice
crisp
finish
that
finishes
clean
overall
i
would
drink
this
if
it
was
all
i
had
but
i
will
probably
go
for
the
traditional
bluemoon
before
i
bought
this
again
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
attractive
the
moment
your
nose
smells
it
you
will
want
to
drink
it
up
if
i
had
any
beer
that
i
would
have
liked
to
be
introduced
to
when
i
started
drinking
it
would
be
this
one
although
that
wasnt
the
case
i
was
introduced
to
many
other
imported
beers
but
this
beer
is
very
attractive
pours
a
hazy
orangehoney
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
honey
and
wheat
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
touch
of
orange
zest
coming
through
as
well
actually
a
great
taste
and
goes
down
each
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
a
great
spring
summer
brew
that
is
from
their
seasonal
collection
a
new
brew
from
blue
moon
i
believe
it
tastes
about
like
they
just
poured
honey
into
the
standard
blue
moon
this
ends
of
being
more
of
a
bad
thing
as
the
coriander
is
lost
and
replaced
with
sticky
sweetness
that
almost
seems
out
of
place
the
decent
mouthfeel
is
the
only
redeeming
quality
of
this
beer
which
i
suspect
will
never
purchase
again
unless
it
again
finds
its
way
into
a
variety
pack
on
sale
life
is
too
short
to
drink
mediocre
beer
o
part
of
the
perils
of
working
in
small
middleofnowhere
towns
means
the
selection
is
next
to
nil
this
is
a
pretty
averagetasting
drink
rather
boring
o
this
beer
is
rather
flavorful
although
i
think
the
honey
and
sweetness
detracted
from
its
drinkability
o
this
is
not
a
terrible
beer
but
nothing
i
would
ever
spend
my
money
on
again
i
could
see
enjoying
this
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
how
summer
day
but
it
would
have
to
be
free

well
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
pours
up
a
beautiful
golden
color
with
a
snow
white
1
12
finger
foamy
head
there
is
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
smell
is
honey
lemon
bread
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
but
there
is
about
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
the
taste
is
very
sweet
but
not
unpleasant
sickeningly
sweet
it
is
inviting
and
pleasing
upfront
the
finish
is
a
little
overpowered
by
the
front
end
but
the
front
end
is
so
nice
that
i
really
didnt
notice
or
care
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
o
pretty
refreshing
summer
beer
taste
is
nothing
that
stands
out
but
not
bad
i
was
more
impressed
with
appearance
and
mouthfeel
not
my
favorite
of
the
blue
moons
but
would
gladly
drink
these
at
a
tailgate
beautiful
amber
color
and
pours
a
pillowy
white
head
the
bottle
says
it
has
honey
and
citrus
taste
and
though
i
could
smell
both
the
honey
and
citrus
i
was
only
able
to
taste
the
hint
of
citrus
overall
i
give
it
a
little
above
average
since
i
was
expecting
a
stronger
hint
of
honey
than
i
got
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
chimay
chalice
my
advice
stay
away
its
basically
coors
original
honey
thats
it
overall
despite
low
marks
for
the
look
and
nose
this
is
a
good
beer
i
imagine
its
nice
and
crisp
on
a
hot
summer
day
medium
bodied
lighter
effervescence
than
i
expected
nothing
to
recommend
it
though
regular
blue
moon
is
preferable
somewhat
warming
after
12
a
glass
overall
honestly
it
taste
like
they
took
coors
light
and
added
honey
to
it
it
is
not
a
complex
as
other
blue
moons
that
coors
makes
it
is
enjoyable
and
i
do
like
the
blue
moon
and
coors
beers
just
seems
like
they
really
didnt
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
this
one
o
this
beer
is
nothing
real
special
but
it
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
see
this
being
a
good
session
beer
for
an
outdoor
cookout
in
the
hot
summer
overall
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
it
tastes
like
a
eurolager
in
some
regards
nothing
really
noteworthy
just
a
hint
of
honey
nothing
i
would
buy
again
o
not
a
good
effort
by
blue
moon
their
yearround
offering
is
much
better
stick
with
that
pours
clear
golden
into
a
pint
glass
1
finger
head
lingered
for
a
minute
light
smell
mostly
honey
and
not
too
wheaty
first
drink
is
lacking
but
sweetness
builds
as
i
continue
to
imbibe
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
for
my
taste
but
crispness
lends
itself
well
to
this
record
hot
june
evening
hops
are
nonexistent
a
floral
nose
would
be
awesome
honey
lingers
on
lips
and
corners
of
mouth
definitely
drinkable
i
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
glass
i
was
greeted
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
that
faded
quick
to
minimal
lacing
the
color
was
a
clear
golden
hue
the
aroma
is
shows
citrus
sweetness
from
the
honey
and
wheat
malt
any
hops
must
be
of
a
citrus
type
that
goes
well
with
the
orange
peel
the
taste
starts
off
with
the
malt
and
orange
peel
notes
fading
to
the
sweetness
of
the
honey
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
average
some
carbonation
but
the
beer
was
thin
in
body
this
actually
plays
better
in
hot
weather
in
my
opinion
for
a
summer
beer
overll
this
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
is
a
seriously
drinkable
summer
beer
its
refreshing
and
in
the
deep
south
welcome
on
a
day
that
is
reaching
the
upper
80s
in
temps
looks
boring
and
yellowish
like
a
lager
but
taste
like
sweet
lovely
honey
beer
hince
the
name
and
style
lots
of
flavor
and
taste
great
mouth
feel
a
lot
better
tasting
than
looking
heavy
like
all
blue
moon
lines
of
beers
but
well
worth
the
feel
just
more
quality
from
this
company
how
did
this
win
a
gabf
gold
medal
pale
fizzy
golden
bright
white

speckled
scattered
lace
aroma
has
cooked
veggies
and
other
cereal
grains
with
a
mild

and

blend
flavors
are
cloyingly
sweet
who
wants
to
drink
something
this
sweet
crushing
flavor
of
grains
mild
citrus
and
sharp
honey
sweetness
actually
making
me
gag
mouthfeel
is
sickeningly
sweet
cloying
light
to
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
induces
a
gag
reflux
overall
i
cant
finish
this
beer
why
is
it
sold
in
12
packs
good
lord
its
horrible
o
overall
i
think
this
beer
would
do
just
fine
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
when
other
options
are
present
i
would
skip
on
the
blue
moon
summer
honey
wheat
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
honey
some
wheat
taste
is
mild
bready
some
honey
not
a
lot
of
flavor
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
nothing
special
its
a
zesty
beer
overall
great
for
summer
the
color
is
a
beautiful
and
deep
gold
it
is
refreshing
and
somewhat
tart
as
well
great
buzz
after
a
few
swallows
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
its
definitely
not
on
my
favorites
list
i
would
recommend
trying
it
over
regular
blue
moon
but
expect
less
of
the
orangey
taste
rjt
this
beer
is
build
for
drinkability
and
in
that
arena
it
does
pretty
well
flavors
are
well
balanced
but
could
use
a
little
more

this
is
better
than
i
anticipated
its
a
nice
drinkable
summer
ale
done
better
than
many
oabout
what
i
would
expect
for
a
blue
moon
seasonal
not
great
and
wont
seek
it
out
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
honey
beer
o
not
bad
for
a
pale
wheat
not
a
bad
honey
wheat
beer
and
a
decent
summer
drink
pours
less
cloudy
than
the
standard
blue
moon
but
there
is
still
plenty
of
hazy
under
a
one
inch
white
head
smells
like
a
wheat
beer
malty
unfiltered
and
a
touch
sweet
floral
from
the
honey
flavor
is
similar
crisp
though
and
there
isnt
much
sweetness
there
is
the
essence
of
honey
without
all
the
sugar
at
the
end
feel
is
not
bad
lighter
medium
body
very
sessionable
with
good
carbonation
perhaps
just
a
bit
thin
for
me
but
it
adds
to
drinkability
overall
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
blue
moon
seasonals
but
still
not
a
standout
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
this
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
beers
to
drink
i
felt
like
i
could
spread
if
over
my
toast
in
the
morning
not
one
part
of
this
beverage
reminded
me
of
beer
whatsoever
i
felt
like
i
was
choking
down
spoonful
after
spoonful
of
straight
honey
maybe
im
not
into
overly
sweet
beers
this
is
beyond
overly
sweet
though
two
people
together
couldnt
finish
a
6
pack
of
this
and
it
was
a
hot
day
trapped
on
a
bus
that
says
a
lot
o
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
was
mostly
impressed
by
the
appearance
but
other
than
that
this
is
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
as
far
as
i
know
i
might
have
it
again
maybe
overall
pretty
good
not
as
good
as
the
regular
blue
moon
but
still
very
enjoyable
atmosphere
is
okay
deep
golden
hue
but
no
real
head
and
no
lacing
nose
is
wheaty
with
sweet
and
citrus
notes
light
body
with
a
sweet
lightly
fruited
wheat
character
overall
this
is
a
fair
quaff
drinkability
this
beer
is
definitely
repeatable
all
afternoon
particularly
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
always
buts
its
too
sweet
for
me
and
lacks
complexity
quite
frankly
its
hard
to
tell
its
a
wheat
beer
its
mediocre
at
best
not
too
bad
but
not
exceptional
in
any
way
not
terrible
but
not
very
interesting
either
the
crack
glug
produced
two
fluffy
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
it
even
looked
like
marshmallow
fluf
in
the
glass
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
smelled
like
a
wheat
beer
kind
of
tangy
and
underlain
by
a
light
oranginess
i
was
glad
that
it
was
not
as
strong
as
the
lime
i
had
earlier
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
that
light
wheat
flavor
that
i
will
always
remember
from
drink
your
wheaties
afternoon
at
sptr
accompanied
by
a
light
honey
sweetness
and
on
the
finish
orange
zest
the
finish
was
semidry
and
quite
pleasant
i
would
probably
enjoy
it
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
than
on
halloweestmas
it
snowed
here
two
days
before
halloween
im
not
sure
why
the
rating
is
so
low
on
this
website
but
id
like
to
run
it
by
a
few
friends
to
see
if
im
crazy
except
i
wouldnt
want
to
share
this
is
one
of
my
new
all
time
favorites
this
has
some
refreshing
qualities
but
the
inconsistent
flavors
and
harsh
acidity
in
the
finish
are
a
turn
off
i
thought
the
sourness
evidenced
subpar
ingredients
rather
than
wanted
qualities
o
very
underwhelmed
by
this
at
least
the
standard
blue
moon
is
a
fair
representation
of
its
style
this
one
falls
short
i
would
say
this
is
drinkable
because
it
is
very
light
bodied
and
goes
down
easy
but
then
my
question
would
be
why
waste
drinking
on
something
so
bland
overall
this
reminded
me
of
leinenkugels
honey
weiss
but
was
definitely
different
i
enjoyed
the
sweetness
and
then
the
contrast
with
a
little
bitterness
not
sure
if
id
seek
this
one
out
but
a
good
change
of
pace
pours
a
pale
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
no
head
smells
of
honey
butter
and
wheat
its
kind
of
sour
but
not
in
a
good
way
it
tastes
of
honey
butter
bread
and
grassy
hops
with
a
biscuity
finish
this
beer
is
thin
and
watery
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
i
didnt
like
it
at
all
o
bleah
couldnt
get
over
the
artifical
sweetener
taste
to
this
i
like
regular
blue
moon
well
enough
but
its
time
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
on
their
summer
beer
pretty
average
beer
overall
although
it
was
quite
refreshing
not
a
bad
summer
brew
but
there
are
some
better
options
out
there
dr
its
pretty
drinkable
rather
affordable
and
of
limited
quality
for
coors
its
not
bad
overall
better
than
expected
sweet
but
nothing
complex
really
light
and
drinkable
much
less
wheaty
than
even
the
regular
blue
moon
and
admittedly
easy
to
drink
as
nothing
really
wrong
sticks
out
just
ok
for
when
your
attention
is
definitely
focused
elsewhere
o
moderate
beer
that
would
be
great
as
part
of
a
summer
shandy
fairly
refreshing
but
a
tad
too
sweet
for
once
i
am
pleased
to
not
smell
a
metallic
or
sweet
corn
adjunct
smell
in
the
nose
hooray
however
i
also
am
having
a
hard
time
picking
up
on
the
honey
scent
promised
by
the
name
of
the
beer
boooo
taste
is
quite
a
lot
sweeter
than
indicated
by
the
nose
it
is
filled
with
all
the
honey
promised
by
the
label
but
not
delivered
by
the
nose
unfortunately
the
flavor
is
also
filled
with
a
subchorus
of
metallic
bmc
adjunct
that
wasnt
present
in
the
nose
at
least
it
actually
delivered
on
the
promise
of
honey
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
very
sodalike
but
also
forgettable
and
bland
overall
i
am
left
with
a
decidedly
average
wheat
beer
with
some
honey
flavor
but
faint
and
unpleasantly
metallic
malts
behind
it
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
its
pretty
boring
and
bland
i
havent
drank
blue
moon
in
ages
and
i
just
bought
a
sampler
12pack
it
will
be
interesting
for
me
to
drink
something
that
i
havent
drank
in
maybe
10
years
10
years
ago
i
was
in
college
and
just
started
out
drinking
beer
nothing
that
makes
me
want
to
spend
my
summer
drinking
this
beer
better
than
a
mainstream
beer
but
not
anything
i
would
seek
out
this
is
nothing
special
hardly
memorable
this
beer
is
almost
good
but
the
mixture
of
honey
and
wheat
is
just
offputting
to
me
im
not
generally
a
big
fan
of
either
in
the
first
place
and
i
dont
think
they
combine
to
make
a
very
good
beer
oh
well
just
my
opinion
decent
effort
from
blue
moon
and
its
definitely
better
than
their
highly
advertised
belgian
wheat
which
made
me
sick
last
time
i
tried
to
session
it
nothing
id
pick
up
often
through
the
summer
season
though
much
better
summer
seasonals
and
even
wheat
beers
for
that
matter
o
an
ok
beer
which
im
glad
i
tried
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
wouldnt
buy
one
overall
a
very
boring
wheat
beer
fake
tasting
and
bland
id
choose
something
else
spice
carries
into
the
flavor
whilst
the
honey
doesnt
at
least
until
the
beer
warms
a
bit
with
some
hops
expanding
in
the
process
more
evident
again
on
the
feel
the
honey
softens
the
finish
and
couples
with
a
slight
citrus
component
now
with
a
light
carbonation
not
much
as
for
graininess
in
the
texture
of
the
beer
offering
a
clean
almost
soda
like
character
as
a
result
the
beer
is
unexciting
yet
smooth
and
innocuous
yet
a
tad
lemony
sweet
in
the
end
o
a
decent
summer
brew
but
there
is
better
out
there
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
honey
beers
unfortunately
taste
is
sweet
sweet
honey
and
citrus
perhaps
even
some
sweet
malt
balancing
and
and
wheaty
finish
kind
of
bland
mediumlight
bodied
wasnt
the
greatest
but
it
isnt
all
that
bad
either
still
there
would
be
other
beers
i
would
crave
on
a
hot
summer
day
ok
in
strength
of
flavor
but
the
flavor
isnt
that
great
too
sweet
not
enough
complexity
hardly
can
tell
this
is
wheat
beer
mediocre
at
best
didnt
hate
it
but
wont
have
this
again
the
taste
of
honey
was
just
enough
to
make
it
a
good
refreshing
summer
beer
but
not
so
much
sweet
that
it
ruined
the
wheat
taste
of
the
beer
it
was
about
what
i
expected
from
blue
moon
probably
not
as
good
as
their
belgian
white
but
a
solid
selection
overall
definitely
a
good
summertimehot
weather
drink
slides
down
like
water
with
good
refreshing
carbonation
and
flavor
however
not
really
my
type
when
i
reach
for
a
brew
this
beer
is
more
like
a
cheep
lager
than
anything
that
honey
flavor
is
strange
though
i
wonder
what
chemical
they
are
using
because
lets
face
it
honey
is
way
too
expensive
an
adjunct
for
big
time
brewing
i
sort
of
imagine
that
they
tasted
standard
blue
moon
with
their
new
honey
flavored
chemical
and
thought
too
themselves
hmm
this
tastes
so
good
we
will
be
able
to
get
away
with
increasing
the
percentages
of
corn
and
rice
and
this
will
mask
the
loss
of
flavor
i
really
liked
this
beers
thirst
quenching
ability
not
too
bland
or
and
not
meant
to
be
served
super
chilled
o
i
wasnt
thrilled
to
try
this
beer
but
was
rather
pleasantly
surprised
it
was
a
refreshing
light
wellbalanced
brew
nice
balance
between
the
wheat
and
honey
o
im
not
gonna
lie
i
do
like
this
beer
sitting
on
the
deck
with
a
very
warm
sun
beating
down
on
me
this
is
refreshing
and
quenches
the
thirst
if
only
it
was
a
little
less
sticky
on
the
palate
afterwards
it
would
be
a
great
brew
to
enjoy
but
it
is
very
good
in
my
opinion
i
would
recommend
this
and
will
get
it
again
when
the
opportunity
comes
up
on
a
side
note
i
will
mention
that
this
makes
a
good
stepping
stone
beer
as
i
have
a
bmc
only
friend
who
is
opening
up
to
new
brews
and
appreciated
the
extra
dimensions
found
in
this
summer
honey
wheat
from
the
355
ml
bottle
marked
oct2411b05100509
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
and
relatively
clear
the
aroma
has
a
sublte
mix
of
wheat
and
citrus
zing
but
little
in
the
way
of
honey
at
least
immediately
the
body
is
thin
and
average
for
the
style
the
taste
has
a
lightly
sweet
maltiness
some
wheat
and
a
thin
hop
bite
at
the
end
it
works
on
a
hot
day
your
typical
summer
beer
adding
lemon
and
honey
to
an
otherwise
okay
wheat
ale
compares
easily
to
sam
summer
except
it
is
sweeter
makes
up
for
where
blue
moon
fails
in
that
you
do
not
have
to
add
a
piece
of
fruit
to
it
but
only
does
so
in
already
adding
the
fruit
and
sugar
good
refreshing
beer
for
summer
barbeques
but
nothing
stand
out
about
it
overall
this
beer
is
interesting
but
not
super
amazing
i
might
try
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
a
sixpack
o
i
could
see
this
being
enjoyable
for
someone
looking
for
blue
moon
light
but
the
promised
flavors
just
arent
there
skip
this
the
honeywheat
taste
lingers
for
a
bit
longer
than
i
would
have
liked
3
5o
this
offering
is
not
something
that
i
would
buy
but
e
chance
to
give
it
a
review
basing
it
off
the
intended
style
i
think
that
it
does
not
fall
too
short
of
what
was
in
the
plans
refreshing
but
not
to
the
point
that
it
drops
to
the
level
of
other
macros
oveall
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
try
and
then
offer
to
your
friends
that
dont
love
the
taste
of
traditional
full
flavor
beer
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
of
all
the
beers
i
have
had
in
the
style
it
is
by
far
the
worst
it
isnt
a
special
beer
by
any
means
or
one
i
will
seek
out
for
a
special
tasting
but
to
my
surprise
i
like
the
simplicity
and
subtle
flavors
in
this
easy
to
drink
beer
id
rather
grab
this
over
a
bmc
in
the
summer
when
i
just
want
a
beer
although
the
price
might
make
me
think
otherwise
over
all
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
light
thirst
quenching
summer
beer
meant
to
refresh
in
hot
weather
therefore
i
will
give
it
this
rating
but
i
am
certainly
glad
that
i
did
not
spent
money
on
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
to
begin
with
then
some
aggressive
carbonation
hits
the
tongue
the
drinkability
is
fairly
poor
due
to
the
sweetness
especially
in
whats
supposed
to
be
a
summer
beer
overall
this
is
the
second
failure
in
the
retooling
of
blue
moons
seasonals
the
base
brew
and
pale
moon
still
remain
solid
enough
but
the
seasonals
give
em
a
pass
o
they
should
call
this
mellow
yellow
more
soda
than
beer
overall
not
worth
spending
much
time
with
a
passable
effort
from
coors
i
give
it
straight
3s
across
the
board
because
its
an
average
beer
no
better
no
worse
in
my
opinion
great
summer
beer
with
high
drinkability
and
reasonable
use
of
the
agave
balanced
and
refreshing
so
being
a
beer
from
blue
moon
coors
this
one
surprised
me
this
one
ranks
as
my
favorite
blue
moon
predominately
because
i
enjoy
blonde
ales
this
one
goes
alongside
cinnamon
orchata
for
my
favorite
offering
from
the
company
easy
going
on
the
palate
but
has
a
great
taste

again
this
beer
is
getting
very
popular
here
in
nj
served
in
a
chilled
glass
this
beer
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
i
can
taste
the
agave
in
this
i
would
bump
up
the
hop
profile
on
this
beer
i
like
blue
agave
tequila
so
this
beer
works
for
me
and
its
pretty
cool
a
big
mass
production
brewer
is
trying
out
craft
style
beers
this
beer
pairs
well
with
sweet
barbecue
ribs
or
chinese
food
this
beer
also
has
to
be
served
very
cold
or
it
is

i

brew
thats
easy
to
drink
in
the
summer
but
certainly
nothing
special
o
its
always
nice
to
try
something
new
and
diverse
however
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
if
it
were
offered
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
or
buy
it
again
id
rather
drink
a
macro
brewpbrbudrolling
rock
etc
i
greatly
prefer
regular
blue
moon
im
sure
someone
out
there
loves
this
beer
but
that
someone
isnt
me
its
appearance
ability
to
go
down
easily
and
slightly
higher
abv
are
its
redeeming
qualities
if
you
want
to
try
this
i
suggest
getting
it
while
you
can
i
honestly
dont
see
blue
moon
making
this
one
again
o
i
didnt
like
it
very
much
but
i
can
see
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
this
one
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
i
wont
drink
it
again
overall
this
would
be
really
good
with
food
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
with
barbecued
meat
the
sweetness
is
overbearing
without
some
salty
food
to
balance
it
still
impressed
considering
the
brewery
blue
moon
agave
nectar
ale
35
clear
deep
golden
hue
with
white
head
honestly
taste
like
a
full
bodied
american
pale
lager
with
a
hint
of
agave
flavoring
full
body
rich
cereal
grains
finishes
clean
with
a
faint
lingering
agave
sweetness
pretty
bland
drinkable
slightly
tart
possibly
from
the
agave
gains
a
little
bit
of
pucker
like
flavor
as
you
keep
drinking
i
was
hoping
for
more
agave
flavor
if
thats
what
your
looking
for
youll
be
severely
let
down
with
a
mediocre
grainy
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
next
time
i
will
just
drink
a
coke
same
cloyish
sweetness
this
this
thing
tastes
like
a
childrens
breakfast
cereal
reminds
me
of
the
swayt
tay
or
sweet
tea
that
rural
texans
are
so
fond
of
sourcing
a
gift
from
bill
b
a
connoisseur
and
brewer
of
great
scottish
and
scotch
ales
go
with
a
cider
instead
im
a
huge
fan
of
blue
moon
for
my
everyday
beer
i
was
excited
when
i
got
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
in
the
summer
seasonal
pack
in
fact
they
were
the
first
ones
opened
one
for
my
husband
too
we
were
both
disappointed
this
is
a
combination
that
just
doesnt
work
it
tastes
nothing
like
any
other
blue
moon
product
in
fact
i
cant
think
of
any
other
beer
that
it
tastes
like
its
sweet
too
sweet
and
not
even
a
good
tasting
sweet
leaves
an
awful
aftertaste
i
love
a
good
tequila
now
and
then
and
others
have
said
its
similar
i
didnt
get
that
from
this
beer
at
all
it
was
just
not
an
enjoyable
drink
it
wasnt
awful
i
did
finish
the
bottle
in
fact
my
husband
didnt
like
his
so
i
finished
his
too
i
usually
dont
mind
a
beer
a
little
warm
this
was
not
good
much
better
cold
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
and
really
dont
recommend
it
unless
someone
is
really
into
sweet
beers
3
195
00
pours
a
clean
deep
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
faint
light
fruitiness
in
the
taste
a
dry
fruitiness
almost
honey
like
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dryer
honey
like
aftertaste
kind
of
sticky
very
big
honey
presence
eh
overall
a
nice
cheap
refreshing
summer
beer
it
tastes
like
something
your
body
doesnt
want
inside
of
it
its
an
awful
attempt
at
an
awful
product
and
its
just
surprisingly
bad
even
from
coors
o
overall
it
was
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
its
not
something
ill
probably
pick
up
again
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
i
feel
that
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
is
not
a
flavored
version
of
the
standard
blue
moon
style
beer
this
is
a
completely
different
beer
the
beer
doesnt
taste
bad
or
anything
but
nothing
really
stands
out
in
this
forgettable
brew
o
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
one
that
i
would
really
desire
to
have
again
it
had
some
strange
artificial
flavors
as
well
as
metallic
notes
the
overall
beer
was
rather
one
dimension
with
the
sweetened
graininess
overall
not
as
good
as
a
regular
blue
moon
it
is
a
decent
alternative
overall
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
its
not
too
cloying
and
its
fairly
refreshing
not
something
i
would
buydrink
again
probably
but
a
beer
that
was
worth
a
shot
the
taste
is
more
like
candy
than
beer
and
not
just
the
sweetness
it
tastes
like
the
agave
syrup
from
the
grocery
not
trace
of
hops
although
there
is
some
medicinal
bitterness
if
ever
a
beer
was
needing
some
crispness
this
is
the
one
id
call
this
a
fruitvegetable
beer
even
if
it
was
brewed
from
rye
im
glad
i
only
had
a
single
of
this
one
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
barons
marketplace
in
san
diego
interesting
that
even
if
it
does
not
taste
like
tequila
thank
you
you
can
feel
it
and
connect
the
agave
here
to
its
end
product
worth
one
try
this
isnt
really
anything
to
write
home
about
if
this
were
less
grainy
it
would
probably
do
better
if
there
was
a
more
pronounced
wheat
presence
offering
some
more
husk
and
straw
notes
then
the
sweetness
would
be
a
bit
more
balanced
as
it
stands
its
a
bit
bland
offering
only
faint
notes
of
agave
which
are
masked
by
an
intense
sugary
sweetness
this
was
nice
to
try
and
tick
but
i
wont
be
having
it
again
o
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
representation
of
style
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
over
this
one
i
bought
this
for
my
girlfriend
who
ended
up
disliking
it
i
didnt
mind
it
so
much
as
long
as
i
got
it
down
when
it
was
ice
cold
the
warm
version
of
this
is
brutal
the
pour
is
a
pretty
clear
golden
color
for
a
blue
moon
copper
hues
and
a
short
lived
half
inch
of
white
bubbles
the
agave
gives
it
a
sweeter
smell
unfermented
sugars
with
that
familiar
tequila
vibe
malts
are
bigger
than
they
need
to
be
here
too
much
caramel
in
the
context
of
the
agave
sweetness
its
one
or
the
other
here
not
both
still
its
only
in
the
finish
that
the
sweetness
hits
and
its
a
malty
summery
sort
of
brew
beforehand
which
when
ice
cold
really
isnt
too
bad
more
carbonation
would
help
or
better
carbonation
retention
and
a
slightly
lighter
body
would
make
it
a
better
hot
weather
beer
i
really
didnt
mind
this
one
though
i
think
its
creative
and
reasonably
well
put
together
for
a
blue
moon
overall
id
say
this
is
better
than
a
regular
bm
not
great
but
not
horrible
do
you
like
tequila
do
you
like
beer
have
them
both
now
pick
your
self
up
a
six
pack
and
slam
them
down
enjoy
it
you
will
thank
yourself
for
it
so
the
first
beer
play
out
as
the
following
hello
how
are
you
today
what
you
came
to
party
the
second
beer
tells
you
that
you
drank
the
first
way
too
slow
and
i
got
friends
that
want
to
join
in
well
so
the
fourth
one
comes
in
and
says
hey
i
know
you
yes
i
told
you
this
was
a
party
well
im
gonna
enjoy
the
other
2
now
they
asked
about
you
i
told
them
you
would
join
them
soon
so
dont
let
them
down
and
pick
yourself
up
some
of
the
blue
moon
seasonal
beats
regular
blue
moon
but
that
is
a
low
bar
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
more
exotic
with
the
word
nectar
in
the
title
i
could
barely
smell
the
agave
i
smelled
more
honey
than
anything
else
its
pour
is
somewhat
impressive
but
lacks
any
wow
factor
but
it
does
go
down
smooth
real
real
smooth
that
impressed
me
quite
a
bit
overall
its
a
decent
entry
by
blue
moon
just
not
one
of
their
best
wheat
and
agave
sound
like
an
interesting
combination
but
the
mixture
is
only
semi
effective
with
this
beer
its
an
okay
beer
that
most
will
find
decent
enough
to
drink
but
there
are
many
others
i
would
rather
have
in
my
pint
glass
during
a
hot
summer
afternoon
taste
is
as
expected
malty
and
sweet
the
agave
nectar
imbibes
a
honeylike
sweetness
that
i
cant
get
past
to
its
credit
it
drinks
smoothly
but
theres
a
distinct
lack
of
complexity
and
a
onedimensionality
that
kills
this
one
for
me
average
at
best
this
beer
is
not
one
that
i
will
buy
again
i
gave
it
a
shot
despite
bad
reviews
because
i
like
the
other
blue
moon
beers
i
wont
make
that
mistake
again
it
did
not
have
a
very
distinct
taste
seemed
to
have
too
much
going
on
the
only
positive
is
that
it
did
seem
to
improve
towards
the
end
the
taste
was
average
at
best
it
left
a
bit
of
a
slick
feel
in
the
mouth
which
was
a
little
disconcerting
overall
this
was
an
average
beer
at
best
i
am
comparing
it
to
other
agave
wheats
that
i
have
tried
and
it
doesnt
come
close
to
stacking
up
i
am
not
seeing
what
the
appeal
is
here
this
hardly
tastes
like
beer
its
more
of
a
sugary
almost
malt
beverage
sensation
and
i
am
not
finding
this
really
appealing
at
all
sweet
biscuit
scent
pours
honey
yellow
with
large
white
head
head
quickly
faded
to
a
thin
nonlacing
film
taste
is
not
what
i
anticipated
i
connect
agave
to
tequila
and
expected
something
like
budweisers
tequiza
this
is
more
of
a
cloying
coriander
and
sour
spice
ale
not
a
drain
pour
but
nothing
to
buy
again
looks
like
i
am
going
to
have
to
give
this
a
slightly
better
than
average
rating
3
25
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
would
be
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
a
pool
would
drink
it
again
but
probably
not
one
ill
pick
up
often
tastecucumber
faint
wheat
the
agave
seem
to
work
against
the
other
flavors
lending
an
oily
sweetish
mouthfeel
that
seem
out
of
place
hats
off
to
blue
moon
for
trying
to
add
to
their
flagship
but
this
one
doesnt
do
it
for
me
overall
it
was
decent
and
reminded
me
of
amigos
tequila
flavored
beer
however
it
wasnt
as
strong
on
the
alcohol
side
as
the
amigos
is
it
was
an
alright
blue
moon
beer
not
a
favorite
however
pretty
good
o
i
was
hesitant
to
try
this
beer
for
a
couple
of
reasons
i
have
found
blue
moon
beers
to
be
either
good
or
not
so
good
and
because
of
the
agave
i
cant
stand
tequila
that
said
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
aftertaste
i
know
it
sounds
odd
but
i
like
the
lightly
sweet
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
salt
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
believe
ill
drink
this
again
o
a
pretty
average
summer
beer
with
nothing
much
to
write
home
about
but
a
fairly
okay
beer
nothing
really
special
about
this
beer
and
with
all
the
other
great
light
to
medium
beers
out
there
with
true
sweetness
such
as
the
hefeweizens
and
dundees
honey
brown
lager
why
settle
for
this
unless
you
got
it
onsale
like
i
did
at
your
local
grocer
or
package
store
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
was
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
remained
true
to
the
common
american
ale
style
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
pours
golden
in
color
minimal
head
and
lace
is
the
best
i
can
say
about
that
smell
is
a
little
better
with
a
soft
sweet
veggie
or
really
ripe
fruit
note
taste
is
slightly
sweet
some
wheat
and
agave
and
mouthfeel
very
smooth
light
to
medium
but
what
hurt
this
beer
most
poor
carbonation
a
little
stronger
would
have
made
all
the
difference
for
me
i
might
buy
again
as
a
change
of
pace
but
its
not
on
my
top
list
crisp
mouth
refreshing
easy
drinking
each
sip
of
this
gets
sweeter
and
sweeter
im
guessing
thats
agave
im
tasting
sweet
apples
mild
citrus
faint
spice
this
is
an
odd
one
a
sweet
fruity
beer
that
i
would
pass
on
in
the
future
too
artificial
pass
a
nice
little
light
sweet
pale
wheat
ale
sweetness
was
not
overdone
poured
a
nice
golden
color
wit
h
some
fliffly
white
head
smell
was
faint
with
no
hop
prezence
what
so
ever
decent
little
summery
beer
and
i
would
drink
this
over
the
belgian
wit
anyday
this
is
so
average
they
tried
to
do
something
with
a
wheat
ale
that
neither
succeeded
nor
failed
bland
it
wasnt
bad
it
was
ok
solid
beer
good
taste
slightly
sweet
dark
gold
color
formed
a
decent
head
that
disappeared
quickly
can
taste
the
agave
in
it
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
slight
carbonation
bubbles
visible
would
buy
again
now
interested
in
how
agave
would
taste
in
other
beers
the
flavor
is
okay
but
it
does
seem
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
it
has
a
mild
agave
nectar
flavor
which
is
basically
an
earthiness
in
the
taste
under
the
wheat
malt
flavor
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
not
great
but
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
considering
it
was
a
blue
moon
only
made
it
through
about
half
of
the
bottle
rest
went
down
the
drain
rjt
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
refreshing
agave
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
light
almost
watery
flavor
that
has
a
hint
of
wheat
and
agave
its
the
kind
of
drink
youd
like
to
have
on
a
hot
day
but
thats
it
it
only
faintly
resembles
a
wheat
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
forgettable
wheat
ale
thats
watery
and
covered
up
with
agave
nectar
overall
a
bit
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
bad
as
the
honey
and
wheat
go
nicely
together
well
worth
a
try
for
its
modest
price
certainly
not
the
worst
from
the
blue
moon
line
still
very
much
forgettable
overall
its
beer
but
not
a
great
one
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
great
for
the
summer
high
d
not
bad
pretty
decent
ale
interesting
flavor
i
would
say
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
go
into
it
with
an
open
mind
agave
and
wheat
dont
seem
to
go
well
at
least
not
in
this
ale
its
so
bad
that
you
might
as
well
just
drink
coors
pours
a
clear
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
sweet
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sugary
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
is
very
one
dimensional
with
sweet
grain
aromas
and
flavors
i
will
add
though
that
a
few
of
these
brought
me
to
quite
a
delightful
drunk
ultrafresh
but
perhaps
too
early
as
it
is
still
quite
cool
for
spring
no
shade
needed
as
i
began
my
pour
resulting
in
two
dense
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
across
the
room
i
saw
midas
and
croesus
rubbing
their
hands
together
but
this
was
all
mine
nose
had
more
of
a
lagerlike
honey
sweetness
along
with
a
limelike
citrusiness
interesting
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
honeywheat
sweet
flavor
on
the
tongue
i
was
reminded
of
my
late
pops
traditional
breakfast
of
wheaties
in
drinking
this
i
think
that
i
will
recommend
a
change
since
fruitvegetable
beer
is
supposed
to
go
away
anyway
finish
was
pleasantly
dry
and
refreshing
and
i
could
easily
see
quaffing
a
few
of
these
during
the
summer
o
too
sweet
for
me
im
not
snooty
about
weird
ingredients
in
my
beers
but
this
was
a
miss
descent
but
a
plain
blue
moon
whitbeer
would
be
better
overall
not
much
to
this
brew
i
think
its
ambition
is
greater
than
the
end
result
drinks
closer
to
an
adjunct
lager
than
a
pale
wheat
ale
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
id
accept
if
offered
blue
moon
failed
me
on
this
one
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
usually
am
very
pleased
with
almost
all
varieties
i
bought
this
in
the
variety
pack
and
tried
it
with
optimism
not
pleased
typical
flat
ale
on
smell
flat
on
taste
and
the
overall
feel
was
i
was
left
unsure
on
all
of
it
left
me
wondering
what
happened
with
this
one
okay
im
not
liking
this
one
at
all
i
struggled
to
take
4
sips
and
now
the
struggle
is
ending
a
drain
pour
for
me
a
below
average
beer
overall
not
a
hint
of
blond
ale
in
it
its
really
just
an
agave
booze
drink
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
sweet
malty
taste
is
also
sweet
wheat
some
citrus
a
touch
of
agave
a
bit
of
an
unusual
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
honestly
if
this
was
not
brewed
by
coors
it
would
be
rated
much
higher
is
it
great
no
but
it
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
o
a
decent
lawnmower
summer
beer
that
one
doesnt
have
to
think
about
there
is
enough
balance
there
to
keep
the
playing
field
even
and
not
be
too
sweet
dry
or
bitter
im
not
quite
sure
about
the
agaves
real
influence
though
there
is
a
fruity
sweet
aspect
to
the
beer
i
presume
is
it
d
refreshing
but
not
great
brilliant
clear
golden
body
with
a
massive
white
head
forms
a
thick
band
of
lacing
with
each
sip
not
bad
smelling
initially
some
biscuit
malts
sharp
wheat
and
earthy
quality
pretty
muted
at
first
but
after
a
few
sips
and
i
let
it
warm
theres
the
agave
nectar
slightly
syrupy
notes
arising
flavor
has
more
cereal
grain
sharp
wheat
notes
and
lingering
sweetness
that
comes
off
as
a
simple
syrup
i
can
see
how
this
stuff
could
get
fermented
into
tequila
sharp
sweet
character
from
the
agave
additions
im
not
sure
that
it
helps
the
flavor
any
its
actually
tooth
numbingly
sweet
and
it
doesnt
help
the
overall
beer
any
i
could
definitely
pass
on
this
the
next
time
bad
idea
i
could
see
that
if
it
was
inspired
by
trips
across
mexico
mouthfeel
is
pretty
cloying
the
sweetness
is
just
too
much
ferment
and
distill
this
out
into
a
new
hybrid
tequila
before
drinking
it
light
to
medium
boy
linger
residual
sugars
are
the
part
im
having
a
hard
time
with
carbonation
no
complaints
in
that
department
overall
hard
to
consume
just
not
an
enjoyable
flavor
profile
thats
as
constructive
as
i
can
be
cheers
o
this
is
okay
the
agave
brought
too
much
sweetness
atmosphere
is
really
solid
really
nice
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
wheaty
and
sweet
but
very
light
and
subtle
nicely
balanced
flavor
is
light
and
pretty
sweet
with
a
steely
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
gotta
give
it
up
to
the
blue
moon
crew
within
coors
for
continuing
to
trot
out
the
new
and
different
recipes
in
their
seasonal
packs
this
year
this
one
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
artificial
lime
im
gonna
assume
this
is
from
the
agave
nectar
corn
syrup
and
a
touch
of
what
certainly
seems
like
dry
wheat
the
taste
holds
notes
of
sweet
and
artificial
lemonlime
think
almost
spritestyle
drizzled
over
peppery
wheat
however
that
may
sound
to
you
it
tastes
a
lot
better
than
i
would
expect
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
syrupy
feel
overall
this
concoction
turned
out
to
be
much
less
objectionable
than
i
imagined
but
it
still
fails
to
pop
scored
some
modern
times
stuff
up
here
in
norcal
courtesy
of
kl
wines
this
is
easily
my
favorite
among
the
ones
that
ive
tried
as
advertised
very
tropical
pineapple
mango
papaya
in
smell
and
taste
tasty
to
the
last
drop
light
refreshing
supremely
quaffable
first
sip
at
mediterraneo
march
18
2015
with
love
prior
to
hermosa
comedy
club
i
loved
this
hoppy
tropical
wheat
beer
at
hunaphu
day
2015
this
was
refreshing
on
a
hot
florida
day
very
good
beer
i
was
astonished
by
how
good
this
beer
is
ive
never
had
a
beer
in
this
particular
style
that
i
liked
all
that
much
they
tend
to
get
lost
between
styles
this
however
almost
creates
an
entirely
new
style
in
and
of
itself
i
kept
waiting
for
there
to
be
a
weird
after
taste
but
there
never
was
it
tasted
smooth
and
delicious
the
whole
way
through
it
is
definitely
light
tropical
and
fruity
so
if
you
like
extremely
bold
punch
you
in
the
face
favors
this
may
not
be
your
cup
of
tea
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
that
is
packed
with
deliciousness
while
staying
drinkable
youll
love
this
i
could
drink
a
million
of
these
o
a
nice
take
on
an
ipa
with
wheat
i
know
it
doesnt
say
ipa
but
that
is
basically
what
it
is
to
me
with
the
wheat
element
that
does
give
something
would
definitely
get
more
in
the
future
this
is
my
all
time
favorite
session
beer
easy
drinking
and
tropical
verdict
a
really
nice
pale
wheat
ale
from
modern
times
effortless
to
drink
at
4
8
and
46
ibu
delicious
on
a
cold
february
day
but
this
makes
me
yearn
for
the
warmer
days
of
summer
hoppy
and
tropical
as
stated
tastes
like
wizards
not
sure
but
if
so
wizards
must
taste
pretty
good
i
could
smell
the
hops
pouring
out
of
this
beer
the
minute
i
popped
the
top
thankfully
the
taste
matched
the
smell
decent
looking
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
if
i
was
able
to
score
this
routinely
i
would
drink
it
routinely
o
decent
nice
graininess
and
the
hop
aromas
complement
the
graininess
nicely
for
a
wheat
beer
very
drinkable
and
tasty
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
a
pleasant
surprise
very
refreshing
blend
of
hops
and
citrus
flavor
surpassed
black
house
as
my
favorite
mt
beer
o
this
is
hands
down
my
favorite
wheat
beer
if
you
are
forced
to
drink
a
wheat
beer
why
not
make
it
juicy
with
hops
modern
times
knocked
this
one
out
of
the
park
citra
hops
in
my
wheat
beer
why
thank
you
i
think
i
will
weird
hoppy
taste
this
almost
tastes
like
it
has
thc
in
it
it
creative
having
a
wheat
ipa
i
love
this
beer
it
is
a
citrusy
tropical
fruity
yet
hoppy
wheat
beer
let
that
all
soak
in
for
a
bit
just
a
really
enjoyable
and
surprising
drinking
experience
highly
recommended
my
favorite
new
beer
from
fortunate
islands
in
san
diego
ca
hard
to
find
not
a
wheat
beer
at
all
this
is
more
like
a
pale
ale
hoppy
yet
smooth
it
has
a
sweet
fruity
nose
and
fresh
hoppy
taste
overall
a
tasty
and
balanced
light
experience
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
out
there
imo
hope
to
drink
lots
of
this
next
summer
total
4250
overall
a
good
beer
maltier
than
i
was
expecting
just
based
on
the
description
but
easy
to
dirnk
and
good
worth
checking
out
overall
while
this
beer
is
a
pleasant
and
tasty
beer
it
is
more
inline
with
a
hoppy
pale
ale
than
a
wheat
beer
from
the
clearness
of
the
beer
to
the
lack
of
wheat
grassy
taste
it
is
hard
to
see
this
as
a
wheat
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
ive
ever
had
i
really
enjoy
the
hop
profile
perfectly
bitter
with
a
great
fruitiness
smooth
light
and
easy
to
drink
modern
times
is
really
killing
it
they
also
post
their
recipes
on
beersmith
which
is
awesome
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
two
finger
head
the
nose
is
all
hops
all
the
time
im
talking
pine
pineapple
tangarine
orange
juice
orange
peel
lemon
you
want
it
its
there
the
first
thing
you
taste
is
the
resiny
hop
bitterness
but
that
is
quickly
followed
by
the
wheat
flavor
ive
got
to
say
i
like
the
smell
more
than
the
flavor
side
note
of
the
fourpack
i
bought
one
of
the
cans
was
a
bit
dinged
up
and
had
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
that
was
offputting
the
other
cans
were
fine
i
had
it
on
tap
later
none
of
that
taste
was
present
tmo
a
wheat
beer
whatchya
talkin
about
willis
this
is
a
west
coast
hop
bomb
not
a
wheat
beer
really
flavorful
but
not
overdone
like
some
west
coasts
can
be
really
tastefully
done
really
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
i
wish
i
could
get
this
locally
great
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
i
can
only
dream
about
having
regular
access
too
my
god
its
good
a
big
tropical
fruit
taste
enjoyed
the
hop
balance
and
the
sweetness
o
one
of
the
best
session
beers
ive
ever
had
the
tropical
fruity
hop
notes
shine
despite
being
less
than
5
abv
the
toasted
wheat
finish
balances
it
nearly
perfectly
4
5
overall
4
25
a
really
nice
take
on
the
hoppy
pale
wheat
ale
substyle
that
seems
to
be
more
and
more
popular
i
like
that
it
manages
to
retain
its
wheat
beer
roots
while
imparting
a
perfectly
complementary
blend
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
through
the
hops
this
beer
has
a
clear
golden
body
with
a
white
thin
head
it
smells
like
honey
but
doesnt
match
in
the
taste
department
the
front
end
is
drab
but
the
back
end
kind
of
makes
up
for
the
mismatch
with
some
sweet
faded
tropical
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
lacking
i
am
disappointed
maybe
i
received
old
cans
who
knows
i
will
revisit
in
the
future

smooth

although
the
carbonation

the

is

while
the

recedes

up
its

big
player
theres
flavor

not

sweetness
in
the

allows
for
a
more

delivers
some

earthy
residue
on

not
unclean
but
has
been
out
in
the
fields
all
day
interesting
drinkable
not
something
id
seek
out
multiple
times
but
happy
if
it
crossed
my
path
a
super
refreshing
beer
with
lots
of
well
behaved
flavor
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
thanks
lincolnbeard
for
the
opportunity
the
palate
opens
bright
and
fruity
with
juicy
mango
and
peach
along
with
grapefruit
and
oranges
this
is
followed
by
an
earthy
mildly
crackery
malt
backbone
dry
snappy
mildly
crisp
and
with
some
wheat
drying
on
the
finish
with
lingering
peach
with
a
faint
bitterness
and
grainy
huskiness
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
is
highly
carbonated
more
than
id
like
in
fact
very
good
smell
is
huge
diacetyl
buttery
popcorn
all
the
way
very
big
disappointment
hopefully
a
bad
batch
because
this
is
not
good
at
all
tastes
buttery
creamy
stale
and
in
no
way
smells
or
tastes
tropical
or
even
wheaty
bad
first
impression
to
a
brewery
i
was
excited
about
and
was
thinking
i
was
really
going
to
like
poured
from
a
16oz
can
into
my
spiegelau
glass
light
golden
yellow
with
foamy
white
head
malty
sweetness
on
the
nose
with
some
citrus
and
fruit
its
not
faint
either
its
very
inyourface
taste
is
not
at
all
what
youd
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
at
46
ibu
this
is
basically
a
pale
ale
with
wheat
malt
as
the
base
theres
a
lot
of
wheat
in
the
front
with
a
good
amount
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
to
go
along
with
it
this
is
an
ipa
lovers
wheat
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
id
say
it
needs
more
carbonation
though
other
than
that
this
is
the
perfect
summer
beer
light
hoppy
and
very
sessionable
good
stuff
from
a
great
san
diego
brewery
this
is
probably
the
best
pale
wheat
ive
had
big
tropical
fruits
and
tangerinemango
nose
great
right
from
the
can
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
what
a
session
ipa
wishes
it
could
be
balanced
sweet
bitter
the
mouthfeel
has
good
carb
and
is
quenching
o
well
ill
start
by
saying
that
there
is
nothing
offensive
in
here
however
its
a
bit
watery
and
has
too
much
of
that
buttery
flavor
in
here
everything
seems
a
little
too
mixed
together
and
nothing
is
really
pippin
in
here
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
but
seems
to
come
at
a
cost
of
a
little
flavor
overall
well
done
ale
made
in
san
diego
canned
in
a
pounder
variant
and
tastes
pretty
freakin
good
overall
ok
but
nothing
special
feels
like
its
a
bit
old
o
overall
this
beer
wasnt
bad
just
hopefully
old
odelicious
wheat
beer
very
flavor
and
easy
drinking
would
be
a
great
summer
session
beer
american
pale
wheat
ales
have
never
been
a
goto
style
for
me
but
this
is
perhaps
my
favorite
example
so
far
dethroning
gumballhead
smooth
delicious
and
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
beers
ive
ever
had
im
really
looking
forward
to
cracking
open
the
other
cans
of
modern
times
that
i
just
received
try
this
if
you
can
o
while
wheat
beers
are
what
got
me
into
craft
they
have
fallen
out
of
my
favor
as
i
explored
new
styles
but
this
is
awesome
this
is
a
wheat
bet
beer
that
i
look
forward
to
its
really
great
this
blows
gumballhead
out
of
the
water
by
a
lightyear
or
two
it
isnt
even
close
if
this
is
available
to
you
you
arent
drinking
it
get
your
head
checked
son
o
great
hoppy
wheat
beer
without
ipa
levels
of
bitterness
amarillo
hops
dominates
the
aroma
and
flavor
a
little
but
the
wheat
malt
balances
it
out
nicely
another
modern
times
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
locally
this
is
a
clever
beer
but
im
not
sure
the
heavy
hopping
mates
well
with
the
wheat
base
an
ipa
or
a
wheat
beer
can
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
97f
as
i
type
this
but
i
dont
think
the
fusion
works
for
me
just
a
really
good
beer
i
loved
it
cant
wait
to
have
another
o
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
perfect
for
drinking
all
day
long
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
flavorful
and
refreshing
brew
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
o
as
ive
gotten
more
into
craft
beer
i
pretty
much
wrote
off
american
wheat
ales
modern
times
has
renewed
my
faith
in
us
brewers
excellent
beer
and
at
less
than
3
for
a
pint
and
4
8
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
really
enjoyable
beer
picked
up
while
on
vacation
in
sd
like
others
said
very
much
like
gumballhead
which
i
love
overall
reminds
me
of
gumballhead
right
away
i
wish
i
could
describe
how
the
amarillo
tasted
but
im
not
sure
if
i
have
ever
had
it
great
beer
pick
this
up
and
head
to
the
beach
and
enjoy
o
very
tasty
offering
from
modern
times
big
fan
of
the
hops
melted
in
with
the
wheat
beer
very
creative
idea
and
if
i
could
get
this
beer
regularly
it
would
be
in
my
rotation
especially
during
the
hot
and
humid
nj
summer
months
othis
a
great
beer
this
would
be
excellent
in
the
summer
have
to
get
some
more
when
in
san
diego
overall
i
cant
imagine
a
better
hop
fix
on
a
hot
day
brings
all
of
those
big
hop
flavors
in
a
small
crisp
easy
drinking
package
outstanding
this
is
not
the
typical
american
pale
wheat
ale
this
is
a
much
hoppier
version
and
as
a
result
the
wheat
flavor
is
really
clouded
out
here
is
this
a
bad
thing
no
but
it
is
just
different
than
what
i
would
expect
it
is
sessionable
and
tasty
and
unique
i
think
they
did
an
outstanding
job
at
creating
something
that
people
will
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
a
new
favorite
in
the
style
for
me
o
an
excellent
warm
weatherbeach
beer
that
doesnt
need
a
high
abv
to
be
high
on
flavor
wheat
beer
lover
apa
fan
this
beer
is
right
up
your
alley
o
this
is
as
good
a
beer
to
beat
the
heat
as
ive
ever
tried
so
light
and
refreshing
while
not
sacrificing
any
flavor
very
hoppy
for
a
sub5
abv
beer
highly
recommended
pours
amber
gold
with
a
twofinger
fluffy
white
head
solid
retention
and
nice
lace
big
tropical
and
citrus
fruit
aromas
mostly
lemon
and
orange
with
noticeable
pineapple
and
grapefruit
crisp
hop
bitterness
overlays
a
grainy
malt
foundation
accompanied
by
a
gentle
peppery
spice
medium
body
and
carbonation
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
hoppy
finish
the
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
stands
out
more
than
in
a
hoppy
apa
the
malts
are
really
really
just
in
the
background
overall
i
swear
this
beer
has
some
of
the
flavours
found
in
heady
topper
a
nice
very
drinkable
and
flavourful
brew
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewer
why
are
brewers
working
so
hard
to
create
session
ipas
now
modern
times
has
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
hoppy
wheat
ale
im
not
only
glad
to
come
across
a
new
standard
among
american
wheats
but
to
see
modern
times
not
risk
any
gimmicky
name
calling
where
india
pale
wheat
or
session
ipa
would
come
across
the
minds
of
other
brewers
overall
id
say
this
is
the
perfect
session
brew
for
a
hardcore
hophead
its
a
simple
and
straightforward
taste
and
aroma
but
its
pulled
off
just
right
if
i
could
get
this
more
often
this
would
definitely
be
a
mainstay
in
my
fridge
thank
you
jay
orear
o
a
goto
summer
beer
and
a
bit
of
a
grower
for
a
standard
beer
that
doesnt
aim
to
be
over
the
top
fortunate
islands
is
best
in
style
overall
this
is
a
truely
unique
drinking
experience
very
well
crafted
and
fantastic
combination
of
flavors
the
perfect
summer
beer
and
one
that
will
appeal
to
wheat
beer
and
pale
ale
drinkers
alike
i
am
new
to
modern
times
but
i
can
say
this
was
a
marvelous
first
impression
i
would
rank
this
as
one
of
the
best
of
the
new
line
of
hoppy
wheat
session
beers
modern
times
certainly
captured
the
big
tropical
citrus
aroma
of
the
west
coast
ipa
and
melded
that
into
an
easydrinking
afternoon
sipper
with
just
a
touch
of
wheat
body
yellow
gold
in
color
the
beer
has
a
thinner
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
draws
me
in
big
time
guava
passion
fruit
some
orange
peel
on
the
palate
you
get
restrained
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
acidity
and
a
light
to
medium
body
due
to
the
grain
bill
the
wheat
gives
it
a
better
mouthfeel
than
some
of
the
beers
in
this
45
session
range
clean
finish
overall
nice
balanced
hoppy
beer
definitely
get
a
big
citrus
taste
after
a
few
seconds
very
much
like
a
good
ipa
but
low

you
could
drink
a

of

i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
as
i
often
dont
like
wheat
beer
great
spicy
hoppy
flavor
and
aroma
o
such
an
easy
drinker
well
done
i
love
citra
hops
and
this
is
a
good
one
to
get
my
fix
do
not
let
the
name
fool
you
this
is
probably
the
most
solid
ipa
ive
had
in
awhile
probably
my
favorite
heady
replacement
here
in
so
cal
poured
this
beautiful
gold
hazy
color
wonder
2
finger
head
big
vibrant
hop
notes
not
just
the
bitter
but
the
citrus
mango
pineapple
oranges
just
beautiful
for
the
taste
im
surprised
the
abv
is
4
8
i
finished
a
4
pack
myself
without
noticing
its
so
drinkable
all
in
all
i
will
keep
this
in
the
rotation
a
very
solid
brew
and
deserves
a
lot
better
reviews
love
that
they
market
this
as
a
wheat
beer
when
its
one
of
the
better
ipas
ive
had
recently
crisp
citrusy
nose
the
citra
isnt
too
powerful
though
and
very
drinkable
it
reminds
me
of
a
more
accessible
alpine
ipa
given
the
choice
id
take
this
over
their
hoppy
amber
which
resembles
a
more
traditional
ipa
though
theyre
both
fantastic
all
around
a
great
beer
that
id
love
to
have
available
on
the
east
coast
this
bright
wheat
is
flavorful
as
any
ipa
modern
times
did
a
lot
with
this
beer
low
alcohol
and
nice
hop
character
and
great
drinkablility
make
this
a
definite
winner
in
my
books
d
i
crushed
88oz
at
the
paltry
sum
of
51us
so
yeah
i
would
say
its
pretty
good
best
brew
i
have
had
by
mt
thus
far
will
keep
this
one
on
the
radar
for
sure
definitely
one
of
the
san
diego
newbies
worth
checking
out
strong
pungent
lemons
grapefruits
pineapple
on
the
nose
and
the
tongue
slick
and
oily
feel
in
the
mouth
and
light
and
flavorful
easy
to
brew
a
great
tasting
product
with
a
lower
abv
i
imagine
but
this
has
a
great
flavor
lots
of
hops
and
bitterness
but
relatively
smooth
lots
of
tropical
citrus
feel
but
i
cannot
imagine
what
a
wizard
tastes
like
very
interesting
and
i
little
different
try
it
id
stack
this
hoppy
wheat
up
against
fff
gumballhead
any
day
really
nice
drinkability
on
the
light
side
refreshing
highly
recommended
this
beer
surprised
me
very
pleasant
my
only
con
is
its
abv
is
sub
5
d
a
very
sessionable
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
regular
modern
times
offerings
tastes
like
wizards
and
san
diego
tastes
like
san
diego
wizards
raul
been
lovin
him
some
pale
wheats
lately
and
fortunate
islands
just
may
be
the
tahiti
of
them
all
hoppy
perfection

update
had
this
again
at
cueva
bar
where
they
called
it
a
hoppy
wheat
the
gigantic
aromatics
make
me
think
of
citra
hops
and
the
crisp
sudsy
mouthfeel
adds
to
the
pleasure
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
hope
is
the
wave
of
the
future
for
san

down
smell
is

taste
is
much
the

with
citrus

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
citrus
forward
hop
presence
contrary
to
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
wheat
based
beer
the
pour
was
golden
and
clear
nose
is
citrus
and
fruity
hops
very
inviting
taste
is
upfront
hops
with
light
maltiness
in
the
background
the
finish
is
abrupt
and
leaves
the
mild
nuttiness
in
the
spotlight
after
each
sip
i
felt
like
the
beer
was
dry
and
was
the
biggest
negative
factor
in
this
beer
for
me
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
though
it
taste
exactly
like
a
more
subtle
version
of
white
christmas
i
believe
it
is
called
but
without
leaving
your
palate
extremely
dry
afterwards

always
around

really
been

since
though
i
kind

one
of
my
favorite
summer
time
beers
picked
one
up
2
days
ago
in
massachusetts
i
guess
sammy
forgot
to
buy
that
one
back
bc
it
was
definitely
expired
but
good
enough
to
hold
me
over
until
this
years
release
the
beer
that
got
me
into
pale
wheat
ales
great
representation
of
the
style
wonderful
golden
color
and
the
smell
and
taste
youd
expect
from
a
pale
wheat
wonderful
lawnmower
and
beach
beer
not
the
best
from
sam
but
decent
flavor
and
look
on
tap
at
the
keystone
pub
in
bethlehem
pa
way
too
much
lemon
not
a
fan
aweful
maybe
it
deserves
a
better
rating
this
is
not
my
style
of
beer
but
sometimes
even
styles
one
doesnt
care
for
end
up
being
somewhat
enjoyable
not
this
used
to
love
this
beer
but
recently
it
hasnt
been
doing
it
for
me
as
strange
as
this
may
sound
the
taste
reminds
me
of
how
band
aids
smell
ive
love
the
peppery
notes
in
this
beer
the
citrus
is
nice
too
its
my
goto
fishing
beer
during
the
summer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
ever
since
i
was
18
i
was
like
when
i
drink
i
want
to
try
sa
summer
ale
i
did
on
my
21st
birthday
not
gonna
go
into
lacing
or
anything
of
the
sort
as
i
dont
really
know
how
to
review
in
that
way
i
drank
this
ale
straight
from
the
bottle
has
some
hoppy
and
citrusy
flavor
medium
light
body
great
for
what
its
meant
to
be
a
beer
for
the
summer
all
i
know
is
when
i
worked
unloading
trucks
on
the
weekend
and
going
to
the
lake
having
these
was
so
refreshing
and
its
just
a
great
easy
drinking
ale
i
rate
it
a
5
out
of
5
considering
this
was
my
first
beer
it
will
always
be
special
to
me
great
light
beer
for
the
summer
easy
to
find
and
a
safe
bet
not
as
much
complexity
as
i
would
like
from
a
true
craft
beer
similar
to
their
porch
rocker
but
not
as
good
rating
based
on
recollection
of
this
as
mainstay
summer
brew
for
several
years
before
i
discovered
ba
and
thus
better
choices
had
it
again
this
summer
and
all
i
tasted
was
the
lemon
zest
taste
is
light
and
citrusoriented
with
plenty
of
wheat
and
spice
malt
notes
a
decent
and
drinkable
summer
ale
not
all
that
unique
nor
complex
but
tasty
enough
to
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
a
good
middle
of
the
road
summertime
ale
if
you
like
seasonals
during
the
season
and
still
like
beer
to
taste
like
beer
this
is
a
good
summer
ale
for
you
rich
gold
color
good
taste
to
it
with
a
nice
finish
a
little
bolder
than
i
expected
for
a
summer
ale
but
no

good
stuff
i
love
summer
aleusually
buy
a
case
each
and
every
springdoesnt
transfer
well
to
a
late
summer
beer
for
meat
that
point
im
reaching
for
a
true
hefe
but
the
lemon
zest
is
completely
natura
and
refreshing
sam
adams
misses
the
mark
with
this
one
very
average
tasting
ale
not
a
refreshing
beer
single
bottle
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
a
honey
yellow
amber
with
a
small
amount
of
fizzy
white
effervescence
that
does
retain
its
form
fairly
well
smells
like
sweet
boiled
grains
lemon
zest
maybe
a
little
candied
ginger
dried
apple
pomace
and
musty
haylike
noble
hops
actually
a
rather
nice
vessel
for
that
dry
wheat
spice
that
many
of
us
have
been
trained
to
appreciate
in
the
summer
months
quenching
and
a
little
tart
someone
at
this
brewery
has
an
infatuation
with
grains
of
paradise
and
these
do
work
here
adding
a
dusty
almost
leathery
spice
note
to
the
zesty
lemon
and
orange
vitamin
c
tablet
citrus
rind
more
dried
grass
and
white
pepper
notes
in
the
crisp
finish
there
is
a
yeasty
sweetness
in
the
background
that
i
am
not
wild
about
although
i
prefer
this
to
certain
local
wheat
beer
offerings
the
classic
sam
adams
noble
hop
flavor
does
not
come
off
as
well
here
as
is
typically
the
case
and
the
background
sweetness
clashes
with
the
tart
spice
elements
the
grains
are
a
tad
coarse
and
the
finish
leaves
a
vaguely
metallic
aftereffect
in
its
wake
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
there
are
better
wheat
beers
to
be
had
so
i
will
probably
not
seek
this
one
out
again
overall
a
really
good
brew
in
my
opinion
i
bought
a
six
pack
at
publix
and
the
first
one
was
great
but
the
last
one
was
even
better
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
with
each
one
that
i
drank
i
really
like
wheat
beer
and
i
also
like
sweet
beer
and
this
beer
is
both
really
great
unfiltered
wheat
taste
and
character
with
the
sweetness
and
taste
from
the
orange
samuel
adams
summer
ale
brewed
by
boston
beer
company
samuel
adams
with
an
abv
of

this
brew
pours
out
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
head
this
is
an
unfiltered
brew
you
can
not
see
thought
it
the
smell
is
fruity
with
a
hit
of
grains
summer
ale
has
a
different
smell
to
it
its
not
bad
it
is
just
different
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
you
pick
on
some
fruits
in
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
clean
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
it
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
samuel
adams
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
serving
type
bottle
i
expected
better
from
the
summer
ale
overall
fairly
average
i
do
enjoy
sam
adams
as
whole
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
while
the
citrus
can
border
on
to
much
i
dont
think
it
crosses
the
line
into
to
overpowering
overall
a
good
staple
beer
which
is
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
the
sam
adams
line
i
have
had
both
cans
and
bottles
and
i
prefer
the
bottles
but
that
is
almost
always
true
of
any
beer
o
good
light
beer
for
a
hot
day
its
your
typical
sam
adams
nothing
special
but
its
worth
trying
o
i
can
see
why
its
popular
im
sure
ill
drink
it
again
on
a
hot
day
because
it
has
a
really
good
taste
better
than
most
other
wheats
but
not
something
id
order
over
a
good
malty
rich
lager
strong
ipa
or
bitter
o
very
good
summer
session
beer
finishes
clean
overall
not
bad
i
had
this
on
july
4
and
it
tasted
great
with
firewerks
overall
this
beer
has
been
around
forever
and
is
wildly
popular
and
figures
to
stay
on
the
scene
for
as
long
as
sam
adams
keeps
brewing
its
a
fine
option
when
youre
somewhere
that
otherwise
has
only
bmc
slop
on
tap
or
when
youre
at
a
picnicbbq
with
people
who
tend
to
lean
towards
same
its
a
decent
ale
for
summer
time
and
is
light
in
flavor
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
good
startup
ale
for
those
wanting
to
get
into
trying
ales
other
then
that
its
not
so
impressive
and
is
a
standard
brew
for
the
basic
market
or
drinker
boring
o
i
used
too
love
this
beer
i
now
only
like
it
way
too
citrus
forward
still
has
the
wheat
going
for
it
as
well
as
its
refreshment
quality
samuel
adams
is
one
of
my
favorite
everyday
beers
and
i
was
happy
to
give
this
a
try
with
a
burrito
at
a
tijuana
flats
it
was
okay
worked
fine
on
a
summer
day
with
a
casual
meal
citrusy
flavor
obviously
i
would
drink
it
again
but
wont
await
its
release
like
i
do
for
the
octoberfest

overall
i
say
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
o
samuel
adams
summer
ale
steps
slightly
away
from
the
usual
coriander
and
orange
peeltype
of
combination
usually
found
in
these
beers
opting
instead
for
peppery
grains
of
paradise
and
lemon
peel
that
gives
the
beer
an
almost
lemonade
feel
to
it
the
flavor
is
quite
refreshing
but
this
beer
could
use
a
little
more
dryness
and
carbonation
on
the
finish
to
up
the
summer
time
drinkability
on
tap
at
mcnellies
okc
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
billowy
white
head
that
only
stays
for
a
bit
not
much
of
an
aroma
beyond
a
hint
of
hay
and
bread
tastes
of
lemon
with
a
touch
of
malt
light
mouth
thats
cool
and
crisp
its
not
bad
but
fairly
unremarkable
there
are
much
better
wheat
beers
to
be
had
overall
it
does
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
refresh
and
relax
you
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
definitely
not
hoppy
for
a
apwa
not
even
close
to
lagunitas
sumpin
sumpin
still
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
nice
orange
tinged
hue
haw
ever
it
does
have
a
weak
head
with
little
staying
power
or
lacing
the
scent
was
appealing
though
definite
smell
of
oranges
and
coriander
the
mouthfeel
is
what
u
remember
the
most
crisp
refreshing
and
very
smooth
it
just
felt
like
a
sessionable
beer
its
taste
was
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
the
simple
flavor
mixed
well
with
the
hops
overall
it
was
another
great
offering
from
sa
this
beer
i
had
already
tried
but
tried
again
for
the
review
the
appearance
is
very
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
with
a
very
light
smell
as
well
although
i
was
able
to
pick
up
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
was
pretty
good
with
a
lot
of
citrus
coming
through
the
beer
itself
was
a
little
thin
for
my
taste
but
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
not
bad
but
not
great
either
o
this
beer
is
ok
and
i
prefer
to
drink
it
paired
with
some
seafoodclams
the
overall
lemon
theme
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
on
its
own
should
there
be
a
lemon
law
for
lemon
flavored
beers
o
this
is
another
one
of
those
beers
that
serves
a
purpose
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
hot
summer
days
its
not
something
that
i
would
sip
and
linger
on
the
flavors
but
it
makes
a
great
beach
beer
o
easy
to
drink
but
very
average
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
the
aroma
is
of
some
citrus
and
hops
the
taste
isnt
as
good
as
on
tap
but
is
of
malts
lemon
and
some
spice
perfect
carbonation
and
goes
down
easy
on
draught
it
is
at
least
a
half
a
point
higher
if
not
a
full
point
overy
good
beer
until
it
settles
on
your
palate
for
a
few
minutes
love
the
initial
lemony
impression
but
not
so
much
as
the
flavor
settles
down
poured
into
glass
the
look
of
this
brew
is
the
best
thing
nice
golden
color
with
a
good
amount
of
foam
dont
get
that
much
of
a
smell
from
it
a
little
citrus
get
more
of
the
citrus
in
the
taste
its
kind
of
crisp
a
lot
of
carbonation
really
fizzy
goes
down
pretty
easy
probably
would
be
a
good
hot
day
beer
overall
this
beer
is
okay
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
as
i
have
always
enjoyed
the
sam
adams
brews
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
as
it
feel
short
of
my
expectations
very
refreshing
citrusy
ale
the
pour
yields
a
nice
frothy
head
slightly
hazy
but
still
a
nice
golden
color
aroma
bursting
with
citrus
smells
as
refreshing
as
it
is
more
malt
than
hop
but
very
smooth
and
sweet
finishes
with
a
bit
of
that
hop
bitterness
youd
expect
overall
very
nice
beer
for
as
it
describes
summer
refreshing
without
sacrificing
taste
o
love
it
wondering
if
the
mellowed
hops
on
draft
turns
into
a
lot
of
hops
out
of
the
bottle
if
not
this
will
most
definitely
be
in
the
summer
rotation
with
dos
equis
and
troegs
sunshine
pils
o
overall
this
isnt
the
best
beer
ever
but
this
is
supreme
fare
as
far
as
summer
styles
go
right
up
there
with
any
other
summer
ale
or
beer
get
it
as
fresh
as
possible
unless
you
only
enjoy
ipas
stouts
or
beers
that
kick
your
face
in
you
should
enjoy
this
brew
overall
i
really
did
not
like
this
beer
at
all
and
it
looks
like
ive
run
into
my
first
true
failure
in
this
series
still
i
do
have
that
feeling
that
the
bottle
may
be
too
old
it
is
a
possibility
over
time
the
lemon
peel
and
spice
can
serriouly
degrade
the
beer
but
still
it
seemed
like
a
bad
idea
from
the
start
an
american
wheat
ale
should
not
be
spiced
and
flavored
like
a
wit
if
this
was
instead
a
hoppy
flavored
not
bittered
wheat
ale
i
feel
like
it
could
had
worked
the
beer
itself
looks
great
its
just
a
fact
that
it
went
very
downhill
very
quickly
25
and
fyi
i
poured
this
one
down
the
drain
this
is
a
good
beer
for
anybody
who
like
a
good
fruity
flavor
in
my
oppinion
i
tried
one
night
with
a
buddy
just
to
try
something
new
has
a
strong
taste
of
lemon
and
other
fruity
flavors
however
dont
be
fulled
after
about
one
or
two
of
these
the
flavor
gets
old
fast
not
something
i
could
drink
every
day
even
during
the
summer
slightly
hazed
yellow
orange
color
with
a
white
thin
head
that
settles
quickly
and
leaves
a
foamy
ring
around
the
top
of
the
beer
aroma
of
corn
and
butter
subtle
flavor
of
biscuity
malt
ron
and
butter
notes
faint
offsetting
bitterness
full
mouthfeel
overall
an
okay
beer
not
overly
flavorful
but
not
offensive
and
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
pale
wheats
all
in
all
nothing
gross
about
this
one
just
nothing
exciting
either
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
it
up
again
but
i
wouldnt
be
offended
or
go
all
beer
advocate
on
someone
if
they
offered
me
one
i
can
see
this
being
a
good
way
to
convert
noncraft
beer
people
into
the
craft
world
but
given
the
seasonal
release
and
style
i
would
recommend
oberon
much
more
than
this
o
blah
nothing
going
on
here
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
just
so
disappointingly
average
the
flavors
could
be
good
but
they
arent
good
together
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
with
a
nice
full
head
which
lasted
a
short
while
and
had
mild
lacing
appearance
was
a
hazy
golden
orange
had
a
light
citrus
taste
with
slight
hop
on
the
back
mouthfeel
was
light
to
watery
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertase
very
good
for
the
style
oan
a
average
wheat
ale
nothing
stands
out
but
easy
drinking
overall
i
like
this
brew
a
perfect
fit
for
summer
just
got
back
from
running
around
and
spending
time
in
the
100
degree
afternoon
heat
and
this
brew
is
refreshingly
good
o
decent
beer
would
get
a
six
pack
of
this
great
for
the
hot
days
of
summer
o
on
the
thick
side
for
a
summer
brew
not
a
bad
wheat
ale
oas
far
as
sam
adams
beers
go
i
think
it
was
decent
fairly
flavorful
and
refreshing
summer
brew
o
a
bit
too
sweet
overall
this
beer
isnt
terrible
but
it
just
isnt
very
good
while
its
drinkable
the
flavors
are
a
bit
muted
and
not
very
balanced
definitely
enjoyable
on
a
hot
day
but
otherwise
a
beer
i
would
pass
on
i
am
a
fan
of
many
samuel
adams
beers
just
not
this
one
on
tap
this
beer
is
a
summer
favorite
not
a
great
wheat
beer
but
at
least
tasty
refreshing
and
interesting
bottled
its
merely
drinkable
not
very
impressed
with
this
offering
beer
was
flat
tasting
and
rather
boring
it
had
a
taste
not
unlike
lemon
furniture
cleaner
that
would
simply
not
leave
my
tastebuds
even
after
the
swallow
was
over
i
totally
chilled
the
next
one
i
drank
for
20
min
in
the
freezer
and
the
enjoyment
level
went
up
considerably
the
off
lemon
taste
was
basically
nonexistent
and
it
tasted
like
a
bland
wheat
beer
very
mundane

the
lemon
taste
compliments
the
summer
theme
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
summer
seasonal
combination
the
taste
and
smell
are
average
and
the
aftertaste
is
about
standard
maybe
a
notch
below
i
would
recommend
a
try
but
i
would
not
place
this
above
average
on
my
taste
pallet
o
the
best
that
can
be
said
about
sam
summer
is
that
its
better
than
their
porch
rocker
disappointing
since
sam
is
the
powerhouse
brewery
in
my
region
and
i
do
like
their
vienna
lager
i
would
take
almost
any
pilsener
or
pale
ale
over
this
overall
samuel
adams
summer
ale
is
a
decent
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
of
the
beer
but
nothing
knocked
my
socks
off
or
made
me
remember
it
after
it
was
finished
it
does
its
job
of
being
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
according
to
the
label
this
ale
is
a
wheat
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
any
of
the
typical
bubblegum
clove
and
banana
flavors
that
most
if
not
all
wheat
beers
have
which
i
guess
would
make
this
a
poor
example
of
a
wheat
beer
but
because
i
dont
typically
like
wheat
beers
specifically
because
i
dont
like
those
flavors
i
found
this
beer
to
be
while
not
very
memorable
or
exciting
drinkable
while
i
wont
go
looking
for
this
beer
specifically
if
offered
it
i
wont
turn
up
my
nose
at
it
overall
very
very
nasty
all
light
in
this
beer
really
a
summer
thirst
quencher
which
was
the
case
today
liked
the
fact
that
the
lemon
addition
was
on
the
soft
side
o
a
very
refreshing
wheat
beer
for
the
summer
there
is
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
but
its
light
enough
and
easy
drinking
enough
to
have
several
its
unfair
to
judge
this
beer
by
the
same
mental
standard
you
use
for
your
favorite
beers
if
youre
a
serious
beerhead
this
is
a
nicelydone
flavorful
wheat
where
i
admit
the
lemon
overpowers
the
wheat
the
grains
of
paradise
add
a
little
spiciness
its
a
warm
weather
beer
and
its
something
you
can
serve
when
its
not
a
beerhead
crowd
never
my
first
choice
for
me
but
a
goto
for
the
summertime
gang
bright
orange
cloudy
color
with
a
thing
ring
of
white
head
with
spotty
lace
smell
wheat
bread
and
lemon
maybe
a
banana
in
there
the
taste
is
wheat
with
a
pepper
bit
up
front
and
a
tart
bitter
lemon
on
the
end
a
litte
spicy
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
touch
of
medium
but
perfect
for
what
a
summer
beer
should
be
to
me
overall
this
beer
gets
called
plan
and
boring
but
its
awsome
for
summer
and
i
love
it
for
sitting
out
on
the
deck
i
think
it
has
nice
flavor
for
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
thin
and
drinkable
during
a
hot
day
sams
summer
ale
2013
sams
seasonal
brews
vary
oh
so
slightly
year
to
year
as
they
continue
to
perfect
and
evolve
the
brew
to
keep
things
fresh
so
it
is
with
this
fine
summer
beer
smells
of
wheat
grass
lemons
and
orange
citrus
bright
cloudy
yellow
body
reminiscent
of
a
heffenweizen
or
a
thick
fruit
beer
low
lacing
and
small
head
on
aggressive
pour
good
mouth
feel
for
warmer
weather
light
crisp
smooth
and
not
too
dry
refreshing
to
say
the
least
skunked
hops
lager
like
front
taste
hints
of
coriander
limes
and
lemons
throughout
midpalate
it
goes
fruity
and
there
is
a
mild
spice
almost
cinnamon
though
they
claim
pepper
from
grains
of
paradise
i
can
see
that
but
its
not
a
hot
pepper
its
a
gentle
bite
transitioning
the
last
taste
where
everything
goes
all
copper
hoppy
as
any
true
ale
should
thus
revealing
its
real
origin
slight
lemon
and
orange
after
taste
a
little
ale
and
alcohol
very
full
and
complex
yet
so
drinkable
despite
all
those
flavors
and
transitions
the
citrus
and
slow
roll
off
of
the
hops
to
a
mild
malt
works
well
creates
a
real
saison
session
feel
to
it
good
with
poultry
or
on
its
own
to
refresh
nice
job
sams
definitely
moved
up
a
notch
on
my
list
no
longer
overbearing
of
citrus
to
the
point
of
turning
my
stomach
after
more
than
2
in
an
evening
i
remember
hating
this
beer
a
year
ago
clearly
i
was
not
alone
and
someone
noticed
progress
is
sometimes
a
good
thing
cheers
3
5
out
of
5
very
good
overall
a
good
brew
but
not
a
great
brew
almost
more
like
a
fruit
beer
category
than
a
wheat
ale
in
my
opinion
a
drinking
beer
not
a
tasting
beer
no
more
no
less
than
expected
its
nice
for
a
hot
day
on
the
porch
but
not
for
a
tasting
with
friends
overall
a
good
refreshing
summer
beer
it
is
a
winner
oreminds
me
of
a
cream
ale
with
lemonade
ive
never
had
leinies
summer
shandy
but
this
is
sweet
and
creamy
enough
to
keep
me
from
trying
leinies
may
buy
again
want
enough
to
try
the
tap
version
its
a
tasty
beer
for
what
it
is
nothing
worth
really
paying
for
drink
it
if
youre
offered
one
i
guess
there
are
quite
a
few
better
beers
from
the
bbc
but
this
one
is
much
easier
to
find
quite
to
my
dismay
this
tastes
of
lemon
peels
and
citrus
fruits
its
good
for
people
who
dislike
beer
with
any
distinct
flavor
and
enjoy
the
flavor
of
a
sweet
rounded
juicy
beerlike
concoction
instead
not
very
appealing
probably
the
worst
brew
sam
adams
is
making
right
now
stay
away
i
never
look
forward
to
this
in
the
seasonal
12
packs
o
overall
its
just
another
wheat
beer
to
me
i
guess
its
got
a
summer
thing
going
to
it
but
i
felt
the
lemon
and
other
summer
characteristics
were
a
bit
faint
if
not
barely
noticeable
still
its
an
aok
beer
that
i
could
see
me
consuming
large
quantities
during
a
barbecue
and
id
buy
it
again
if
there
was
nothing
better
not
to
hate
on
it
but
sam
adams
has
some
much
better
beers
you
could
drink
the
color
is
great
the
initial
feel
is
great
overall
i
would
buy
buy
this
beer
again
pours
hazy
golden
with
minimal
head
aroma
of
grain
bread
with
a
slight
lemony
nose
taste
is
very
hefeweizen
bready
without
the
banana
and
bubblegum
notes
and
other
sweet
accents
finish
is
chalky
dry
and
abrupt
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
to
remember
soso
not
impressed
taste
is
smooth
no
bitter
no
real
after
taste
and
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
to
me
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
an
enjoyable
summer
beer
to
drink
it
is
not
as
light
as
a
bud
light
coors
light
etc
but
if
your
looking
for
a
lighter
beer
with
some
flavor
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
totally
decent
wheat
beer
for
summer
had
this
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
gass
ive
always
liked
the
soft
hazy
yellowgold
of
a
sam
summer
i
think
it
has
a
color
that
is
less
pale
and
hazy
than
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
but
isnt
too
gold
just
a
somewhat
unique
appearance
the
lemon
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
but
not
so
bad
as
to
be
a
turnoff
overall
refreshing
malty
beer
no
hops
no
complexity
it
appeared
inviting
but
cmon
i
expect
greater
things
from
the
brewery
that
brought
us
sam
adams
its
mediocre
beer
the
first
sip
reveals
a
light
body
a
crisp
finish
wheat
bread
aftertaste
there
is
a
nice
spiciness
a
very
nice
lightness
to
the
body
no
cloying
sweetness
obviously
this
is
a
ubiquitous
summer
beer
usually
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
swirlability
in
a
tulip
improved
this
beer
tremendously
its
a
nice
summer
offering
a
party
beer
sure
to
please
those
looking
for
a
not
too
imposing
wheat
beer
relatively
complex
for
a
summer
ale
orangish
cloudly
look
decent
mouthfeel
the
smell
was
very
lemony
and
the
taste
followed
suit
it
just
had
too
much
lemon
taste
for
me
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
but
the
lemon
flavor
overpowered
everything
else
o
solid
summer
ale
that
i
could
enjoy
on
a
lazy
summer
day
id
get
this
again
cheers
while
nothing
id
actively
seek
out
this
is
a
nice
light
ale
that
balances
decent
flavor
with
great
drinkability
good
when
fresh
and
on
tap
big
upgrade
over
a
macro
pale
lager
samuel
adams
summer
ale
35
o
another
solid
entry
from
boston
beer
while
most
of
their
beers
dont
blow
you
away
they
are
all
wellmade
and
solid
craft
beers
and
ive
never
had
a
bad
one
this
years
summer
ale
is
better
than
those
ive
had
before
which
were
underwhelming
and
very
bland
so
kudos
to
them
for
that
yup
taste
is
a
wheat
pale
ale
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
that
big
of
a
distinction
between
these
wheat
ales
this
is
just
a
typical
everyday
refreshing
beer
this
wont
blow
anybodies
socks
off
but
is
perfect
for
sitting
on
the
beach
if
found
for
the
right
price
this
is
totally
worth
it
on
a
hot
day
o
i
really
like
this
beer
refresher
ing
for
a
summers
day
but
flavorful
and
drinkable
i
think
this
is
a
case
of
the
sam
adams
hate
bringing
the
rating
of
this
one
down
its
nice
and
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
i
seem
to
remember
last
years
being
fuller
bodied
and
less
grainy
though
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
springtime
always
means
sam
summer
this
seems
to
be
everywhere
of
course
in
boston
of
course
kind
of
a
goto
beer
for
many
and
i
always
mildly
like
it
typical
wheat
ale
pours
a
nice
clear
color
and
has
a
nice
crisp
taste
doesnt
blow
me
away
by
any
means
but
it
is
a
good
beer
that
is
consistent
pours
a
hazy
golden
light
amber
color
light
head
medium
head
dissipates
quickly
has
a
light
cripsy
summer
taste
very
drinkable
solid
taste
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
im
listening
to
titus
andronicus
right
now
hopefully
tickets
to
americanarama
bob
dylan
wilco
and
mmj
arent
too
expensive
these
reviews
are
largely
for
myself
overal
the
wheat
and
the
lemon
citrus
seem
to
make
up
the
majority
of
smell
and
taste
that
this
brew
has
to
offer
yet
both
are
certainly
underwhelming
i
would
not
get
this
again
but
probably
will
if
it
comes
in
next
years
summer
sampler
which
im
sure
it
will
its
not
a
bad
drink
probably
best
enjoyed
colder
on
a
hot
day
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
following
on
the
heels
of
alpine
spring
is
tough
in
fact
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
like
they
removed
50
of
the
flavor
from
alpine
spring
and
rebranded
it
as
summer
ale
ive
tried
it
on
tap
from
two
different
establishments
this
week
and
the
experience
was
the
same
it
makes
a
nice
accompaniment
with
a
meal
and
its
better
than
standard
macro
fare
but
not
much
o
a
solid
wheat
ale
that
is
tasty
and
refreshing
doesnt
exactly
blow
me
away
but
it
goes
down
easy
and
like
most
sam
adams
beers
it
does
not
disappoint
golden
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
and
heavy
carbonation
sweet
citrus
and
fruity
aroma
tart
citrus
taste
with
yeast
bread
notes
peppery
spice
aftertaste
light
body
good
for
times
in
the
summer
when
you
want
a
summer
beer
but
not
a
bud
light
with
lime
overall
it
reminds
me
of
the
dullness
of
a
40s
malt
liquor
without
the
alcohol
punch
i
personaly
do
not
like
citrusy
beers
i
love
piney
bitter
sour
and
extra
hopped
beers
but
not
citrus
my
butt
lips
puckered
the
next
day
after
drinking
this
not
cool
pours
gold
with
a
bright
white
head
with
fair
retention
and
spotty
lacing
smells
and
taste
like
lemon
yeast
zest
and
wheat
light
bodied
decent
carbonation
not
much
to
like
here
o
one
of
the
weaker
offerings
from
boston
beer
yet
still
at
or
slightly
above
average
3
25
o
this
is
a
solid
american
wheat
ale
that
i
feel
gets
a
bit
of
a
bad
rap
in
all
honesty
i
cant
see
how
it
doesnt
stack
up
favorably
to
most
beers
of
this
style
as
it
is
more
flavorful
and
interesting
than
most
not
a
perfect
beer
but
definitely
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
recommend
to
fans
of
wheat
beers
in
general
o
you
know
what
for
what
this
is
it
is
not
that
bad
i
would
drink
this
in
the
summer
while
i
would
not
actively
seek
it
out
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
offered
to
me
a
nice
light
summer
beer
very
easy
drinking
but
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
peppery
flavors
from
the
grains
of
paradise
used
unfortunately
they
were
absent
drinkability
an
acceptable
accompaniment
to
my
steak
and
potatoes
but
not
really
to
my
taste
so
i
might
drink
this
with
beethovens
pastoral
symphony
6
overall
this
was
o
k
hazy
yellow
orange
in
color
with
a
very
fizzy
head
that
leaves
a
nice
ring
of
lace
on
top
aroma
is
suprisingly
heavy
on
the
malt
with
a
bread
dough
aroma
add
in
some
orange
and
lemon
peel
kind
of
taste
like
a
flavorful
unsweet
tea
heavy
on
the
lemon
with
a
spice
kick
i
cant
quite
figure
out
what
the
spice
is
im
guessing
grains
of
paradise
because
thats
what
it
says
on
the
bottle
thin
mouthfeel
thats
perfect
for
summertime
sessions
overall
not
a
bad
summer
beer
not
great
but
not
bad
either
good
beach
beer
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
feel
it
compares
quite
favourably
to
most
summerseasonal
ales
out
there
final
grade
3
8
a
solid
b
easily
one
of
the
best
americanstyle
wheat
ales
available
in
this
market
i
tend
to
be
more
of
a
hefewit
guy
but
this
is
a
nice
changeup
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
recommend
or
purchase
again
a
solid
brew
that
is
well
worth
picking
up
particularly
if
you
are
a
fan
of
wheaty
beers
in
general
serving
type
ontap
mouthfeel
as
i
said
too
much
carbonation
for
a
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
after
having
bells
oberon
this
just
doesnt
serve
a
purpose
to
me
anymore
its
drinkable
and
i
like
it
but
not
so
much
anymore
of
all
the
seasonal
beers
that
sam
adams
produces
this
is
certainly
my
least
favorite
this
brew
is
better
than
most
of
the
gimmicky
seasonals
that
you
will
find
on
the
shelf
of
your
local
supermarket
but
certainly
at
the
bottom
end
of
what
the
samuel
adams
brewery
puts
out
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
that
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
or
even
order
in
a
bar
o
acceptable
and
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
final
thoughts
oh
the
dreaded
summer
seasonal
wish
breweries
would
get
a
little
more
creative
with
this
basically
an
average
wheat
beer
if
thats
your
thing
then
go
for
it
if
not
then
try
their
boston
lager
of
something
a
little
more
robust
a
pleasant
brew
but
not
as
strong
a
thirst
quencher
as
i
had
anticipated
perhaps
this
is
best
for
evenings
in
late
summer
or
perhaps
it
is
best
to
have
a
second
overall
definatly
one
of
my
favorites
and
always
will
be
overall
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
one
after
hearing
the
ad
on
the
radio
this
is
a
run
of
the
mill
wheat
beer
nothing
too
special
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
creamy
white
head
smells
like
iced
tea
with
lemon
taste
is
initially
some
fresh
wheat
dough
followed
by
a
hint
of
pepper
after
that
is
a
big
lemony
sweet
component
it
finishes
with
a
whipped
cream
flavor
along
with
a
hint
of
herbal
hops
quite
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
pretty
good
wheat
beer
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
the
lacing
off
the
fine
collar
was
impressive
and
sticky
leaving
fishnets
all
the
way
down
my
glass
the
aroma
was
of
pale
malt
light
crystal
malts
and
a
hint
of
must
the
flavors
were
clean
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
blase
i
tasted
pale
malts
a
hint
of
spice
from
the
grains
of
paradise
but
almost
no
hop
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
lightmedium
and
the
carbonation
moderate
i
know
this
beer
is
very
popular
but
truth
be
told
i
find
it
rather
forgettable
o
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
summer
beers
if
you
gotta
have
one
you
gotta
have
six
better
than
blue
moon
and
leinenkugels
version
of
a
shandy
not
the
best
summer
beer
ive
had
but
its
far
from
the
worst
a
good
starter
for
someone
thats
new
to
craft
beer
o
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
and
is
tasty
enough
doesnt
have
quite
the
bite
needed
to
be
distinctive
and
refreshing
enough
to
deal
with
this
balmy
northeast
heatwave
but
its
tasty
and
accesible
something
i
would
feel
very
confident
bringing
to
a
summer
party
knowing
it
would
suit
or
at
least
it
wont
offend
any
taste
the
beer
pours
a
piss
yellow
with
some
orange
flame
towards
the
middle
of
the
glass
and
thin
frothy
styrofoam
white
that
bubbles
like
nothing
and
dissipates
pretty
quickly
leaving
edged
up
light
lacing
that
really
doesnt
last
either
and
fades
away
to
a
clean
glass
edge
the
smell
is
light
and
wheatlike
with
some
nice
spicy
notes
that
almost
remind
of
oregano
but
must
be
the
grains
of
paradise
the
citrus
layersin
throughout
the
smell
as
well
the
beer
tastes
similar
to
the
smell
its
a
little
thicker
with
its
wheat
taste
but
the
spices
play
nicely
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
again
drawing
to
mind
the
grains
of
a
paradise
flavor
and
some
citrusy
sides
there
are
definitely
some
other
spicy
notes
present
that
suggest
that
the
yeast
did
some
nice
things
to
the
flavor
but
they
are
faint
beside
the
citrus
wheat
and
grains
of
paradise
this
beer
is
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
but
a
little
thin
and
watery
over
all
carbonation
is
a
little
coarse
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
but
overall
quite
nice
there
is
also
a
slight
jellylike
feel
that
is
left
on
the
tongue
after
the
beer
washes
through
the
after
feel
of
the
mouth
is
actually
quite
nicely
refreshed
and
wetted
which
is
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
decent
summer
wheat
ale
i
definitely
like
it
more
than
smuttynoses
summer
weizen
which
is
the
only
other
summer
wheat
ale
i
have
really
had
this
summer
not
my
favorite
beer
but
not
terrible
either
i
would
have
it
again
a
great
cheaper
price
for
decent
beer
this
bier
is
light
and
dry
with
the
lemon
peel
quite
evident
and
refreshing
the
aframomum
melegueta
is
found
in
the
lightly
spicy
and
peppery
finish
and
lingers
slightly
on
the
palate
i
dont
usually
go
for
these
summery
type
biers
but
this
one
hit
the
spot
especially
on
a
hot
july
day
prosit
1481
odrinkable
but
not
the
best
that
i
have
had
o
not
a
bad
taste
but
its
a
bit
too
greasy
and
synthetic
for
me
to
love
mouthfeel
this
is
a
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
a
person
could
drink
several
of
without
getting
too
full
or
your
tongue
taking
a
beating
from
too
intense
of
flavor
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
at
the
lake
or
at
the
campground
paid
10
for
a
6
pack
of
this
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
lager
glass
pours
a
deep
yellowish
orange
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
the
smell
is
of
banana
and
wheat
with
a
little
bit
of
odd
skunk
the
taste
was
of
stale
lemons
and
perhaps
some
stale
wheat
and
oranges
sounds
appealing
but
keep
in
mind
that
they
all
tasted
like
fruits
long
passed
their
due
date
the
mouthfeel
was
heavily
carbonated
with
almost
none
of
the
flavors
coming
through
except
for
some
extreme
bitterness
from
sitting
it
in
the
mouth
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
at
a
time
overall
this
beer
was
not
worth
the
money
whatsoever
its
too
bad
i
wanted
this
beer
to
be
good
but
i
just
couldnt
get
passed
the
lemon
dish
soap
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
ogood
typical
sammy
everything
here
is
decent
but
its
not
anything
out
of
the
ordinary

served
in
a

glass
23oz

out
to
thin
white

and
hazy

aroma
is
sharp
wheat
malt
and
muted
lemon
grass
and
pepper
flavor
is
a
strong
wheat
graininess
and
tartness
with
a
grassy
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
but
rough
and
a
bit
parching
overall
this
tastes
like
a
typical
american
wheat
ale
the
lemon
peel
and
grains
of
paradise
dont
really
stand
out
blink
and
you
miss
it
head
smells
way
stronger
than
it
tastes
slightly
bitter
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
then
lemony
all
the
way
down
not
a
fan
of
fruity
beers
per
se
but
this
is
as
fruity
as
i
will
go
delightful
beer
to
sip
on
while
mowing
the
lawn
in
my
opinion
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
considered
a
bit
refreshing
but
the
taste
is
not
that
interesting
except
that
the
grains
of
paradise
prevent
it
from
being
bland
o
a
pretty
interesting
beer
the
spice
is
a
nice
new
flavor
though
a
little
overpowering
making
the
other
flavors
heavier
and
lightening
the
carbonation
would
add
to
it
good
beer
for
the
summer
time
o
a
bit
boring
imo
but
it
gets
the
job
done
in
the
summertime
playing
horse
shoes
or
grilling
burgers
but
there
are
much
better
summer
options
out
there
o
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
sweet
wheat
and
tart
fruits
nice
and
drinkable
especially
on
hot
days

and
leaves

smells
of

very
clean
and
nice
tastes
of

with

very

oa

a

if

could

a

worse
originally
reviewed
05092011
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
an
average
example
of
the
style
nothing
about
this
beer
was
bad
but
there
was
also
nothing
that
stuck
out
as
being
well
done
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
a
little
refreshing
but
the
flavors
dont
hold
my
interest
and
one
is
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
wasnt
that
bad
and
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
this
style
what
i
like
least
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
it
was
a
little
lighter
then
it
should
be
and
the
flavors
didnt
come
together
as
well
as
some
of
the
better
beers
in
the
style
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
i
would
much
rather
have
oberon
for
a
similar
price
oberon
is
much
better
all
the
way
around
this
is
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
it
to
be
the
new
summer
staple
this
beer
was
ok
as
far
as
summer
ales
go
but
oberon
is
still
my
favorite
of
the
style
this
beer
doesnt
come
close
to
being
as
good
and
is
pretty
average
all
the
way
around
this
is
pretty
much
the
perfect
example
if
what
an
average
apwa
is
like
this
beer
is
going
to
need
some
work
if
they
want
it
to
be
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
what
is
o
good
flavor
for
an
outdoor
summer
beer
o
this
is
an
average
american
wheat
ale
nothing
really
stands
out
anywhere
the
use
of
grains
of
paradise
is
unique
but
it
comes
across
just
like
peppery
yeast
that
is
commonly
used
in
wheat
beers
all
this
being
said
it
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
fit
for
the
summer
also
it
seems
like
this
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
something
for
which
sam
adams
is
pretty
famous
overall
an
unimpressive
seasonal
offering
just
make
winter
lager
yearround
have
oberon
instead
overall
absolutely
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
or
recommend
i
had
a
feeling
this
was
going
to
be
similar
to
the
way
people
described
summer
shandy
to
me
and
that
didnt
sound
like
my
bag
and
this
beer
certainly
is
not
my
type
the
artificial
fruit
flavoring
just
like
that
in
almost
any
beer
really
ruins
any
flavoring
or
drinkability
maybe
this
is
beer
is
right
up
somes
alley
but
not
mine
i
have
done
my
best
to
write
an
objective
review
but
i
couldnt
help
but
for
a
little
bit
of
opinion
to
seep
in
o
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
easily
a
beer
that
you
could
have
many
times
in
a
session
the
lightness
of
the
aroma
and
smell
make
this
a
great
seasonal
beer
for
the
summer
i
recommend
it
though
but
prefer
the
lager
version
as
it
should
be
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
ale
i
would
probably
never
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
a
large
quantity
of
these
but
it
is
a
quality
made
product
and
a
nice
inclusion
in
the
sampler
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
of
a
beer
its
not
the
greatest
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
unique
in
its
own
way
underrated
in
my
opinion
intriguing
nose
of
fresh
fruit
juice
black
pepper
and
light
malts
flavor
is
complex
for
a
summer
beer
some
spice
happening
up
front
followed
by
a
lemongrassy
citrus
thing
that
isnt
acidic
but
it
is
sharp
some
hops
in
the
finish
and
the
grains
of
paradise
seasoning
really
adds
some
depth
without
being
distracting
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
always
have
when
its
ice
cold
it
is
as
good
a
summer
beer
as
any
the
malt
profile
is
perfectly
light
the
body
is
light
the
carbonation
is
right
on
and
its
an
easy
12pack
on
hot
summer
afternoon
i
have
very
little
to
critique
about
this
beer
maybe
a
bit
of
a
funky
aftertaste
but
just
keep
sipping
and
its
real
good
o
diacetyl
doesnt
fit
into
this
style
and
the
puckering
taste
is
unpleasant
dont
like
rating
this
beer
so
low
but
there
are
some
serious
flaws
with
this
overall
this
is
strictly
a
hot
weather
getworkdonearoundtheyard
beer
nothing
special
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
a
great
one
either
too
much
of
a
grainy
taste
and
not
enough
to
cut
through
it
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
its
all
right
o
typical
fare
from
an
american
macrobrewery
not
terrible
but
not
very
good
passable
as
a
thirst
quencher
with
a
meal
but
certainly
not
good
enough
to
enjoy
on
its
own
overall
a
great
tasting
and
refreshing
beer
great
for
sitting
outside
a
beer
that
i
drink
because
everyone
else
is
drinking
it
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
and
not
a
favorite
of
that
style
to
boot
just
another
summer
ale
3
5
ooki
guess
nothing
special
o
a
decent
session
beer
perfect
for
warm
weather
to
be
honest
this
summer
ale
would
be
perfect
if
they
left
out
that
grain
of
paradise
just
keep
it
simple
and
refreshing
but
overall
this
wheat
ale
is
decent
of
summer
very
dizzy
and
alight
look
but
not
any
sort
of
lager

a

o
ive

the
sams
summer
quite
a
few
times
and
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
there
are
much
better
summer
beerswheat
beers
out
there
to
me
it
has
a
pleasant
lemony
smell
but
the
taste
isnt
quite
there
it
has
too
much
of
a
watery
taste
that
doesnt
quite
taste
right
i
tried
the
dogfish
namaste
right
before
this
to
compare
and
it
was
significantly
better
that
beer
had
much
more
flavor
something
sams
summer
should
definitely
try
to
strive
for
its
a
decent
local
beer
for
hot
summer
days
but
there
are
definitely
some
better
options
out
there
if
i
wasnt
from
massachusetts
the
desire
to
try
this
beer
probably
wouldnt
be
as
high
as
if
i
were
from
somewhere
other
than
new
england
with
that
being
said
this
beer
is
only
a
notch
above
blue
moon
and
shock
top
i
like
how
there
isnt
an
adjunct
used
in
the
brewing
process
but
it
still
just
tastes
too
similar
to
blue
moon
and
shock
top
and
not
enough
like
a
craft
brewer
made
it
samuel
adams
summer
ale
is
practically
ubiquitous
in
bars
and
restaurants
across
the
country
during
the
warm
months
in
typical
samuel
adams
fashion
its
quality
falls
about
directly
in
between
a
high
quality
micro
brew
and
a
macro
i
found
the
lemon
grass
notes
a
little
offputting
in
this
beer
but
appreciated
the
attempt
at
complexity
nontheless
i
would
drink
this
if
given
to
me
but
would
much
rather
pick
up
widmer
hef
for
a
heatbeating
american
pale
wheat
maybe
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
but
this
is
my
least
favorite
sams
by
far
o
this
is
an
okay
seasonal
it
is
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
overall
when
its
hot
outside
or
not
you
would
be
crazy
not
to
try
it
out
you
dont
drink
this
for
a
buzz
you
drink
this
because
you
want
a
relaxing
beer
after
a
hard
days
work
we
all
deserve
it
salud
o
an
ok
summer
ale
but
there
are
better
options
for
the
warm
weather
overall
this
tastes
ok
but
its
very
spicy
not
really
my
style
of
beer
o
to
quote
mr
horse
from
ren
and
stimpy
no
sir
i
dont
like
it
its
drinkable
but
theres
nothing
here
to
inspire
drinking
this
easily
next
rjt
it
is
what
it
is
sam
adams
is
kind
of
a
non
craft
beer
guys
beer
i
appreciate
that
and
see
this
beer
as
a
good
offering
of
that
id
drink
it
with
family
while
out
fishing
or
grilling
average
overall
the
taste
profile
was
disjointed
overall
a
decent
summer
ale
although
its
only
april
here
in
global
warming
land
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
clash
of
lemon
tartness
really
tears
me
away
from
drinking
it
again
o
this
is
better
than
i
remember
easy
drinker
but
enough
going
on
to
keep
you
interested
good
beer
to
have
the
sox
game
or
something
very
unoffensive
not
surprising
that
this
is
one
of
sams
best
sellers
in
sam
adams
top
50
i
recommend
it
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
summery
drinkable
ale
cheers
o
i
can
see
a
lot
of
people
would
want
this
sitting
on
a
beach
somewhere
in
the
summer
me
however
well
im
not
sure
if
id
seek
it
out
on
purpose
avoid
mouthfeel
is
fine
very
light
body
light
to
moderate
carbonation
ill
never
get
this
again
boring
mildly
offensive
flavor
and
aroma
o
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
enjoyed
it
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
with
an
abundant
white
head
that
dissipates
carbonation
does
not
appear
to
be
abundant
aromas
of
wheat
and
citrus
are
present
in
the
smell
there
isnt
much
spice
in
the
smell
if
it
is
detectable
at
all
the
citrus
flavor
melds
well
with
the
flavors
of
the
wheat
the
peppery
nature
of
the
grains
of
paradise
cuts
in
nicely
to
help
balance
the
flavors
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
its
very
refreshing
now
that
temperatures
have
reached
the
80s
here
in
louisiana
it
will
only
become
more
refreshing
as
the
temperatures
climb
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
crisp
and
refreshing
it
serves
its
purpose
in
many
ways
and
i
feel
it
does
it
well
man
the
smells
check
bounced
on
this
one
very
light
but
unbalanced
slight
hints
of
lemons
balance
out
the
wheat
twang
and
the
grains
of
paradise
which
i
can
only
assume
taste
peppery
come
through
only
very
slightly
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
bright
white
head
orange
rind
and
lemon
zest
on
the
nose
bits
of
sweetened
biscuits
as
well
creamy
mouthfeel
with
lower
than
average
carbonation
sweet
fruitiness
of
citrus
and
orange
a
bit
grainy
some
detectable
wheatiness
almost
clove
like
finish
with
a
very
modest
spicy
hop
profile
on
the
back
end
big
but
slightly
bland
as
well
i
dont
mind
the
taste
it
is
unique
but
heavy
for
a
summer
seasonal
would
be
really
really
good
with
breakfast
though
oddly
enough
haha
i
guess
its
a
good
summer
day
started
drinkability
very
repeatable
particularly
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
really
memorable
it
just
didnt
stand
out
to
me
it
produced
good
value
for
the
cost
was
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
probably
buy
it
again
for
an
afternoon
at
the
pool
with
friends
appears
as
a
somewhat
murky
amber
with
orangish
highlights
and
a
fluffy
two
finger
head
with
fairly
decent
lacing
looks
like
a
hefeweizen
in
appearance
not
a
pale
wheat
ale
the
grains
of
paradise
produce
a
funky
aroma
that
i
really
like
sort
of
like
a
cross
between
cracked
peppercorns
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
anise
almost
like
a
chinese
five
spice
blend
on
top
of
a
fragrant
lemon
peel
and
wheat
malt
flavor
is
spiced
similarly
to
the
nose
but
at
a
slightly
more
muted
level
texture
is
kind
of
thick
but
not
syrupy
finish
is
also
kind
of
strange
because
all
the
spicing
drops
away
leaving
the
orange
peel
all
by
its
lonesome
in
the
end
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
worth
buying
again
this
beer
does
it
for
me
pretty
weak
not
all
that
interesting
its
a
good
summer
beer
but
im
not
blown
away
overall
this
is
good
fare
nicely
fitting
the
summer
ale
moniker
as
a
light
refreshing
beer
good
for
hot
summer
months
when
heavy
flavors
and
high
abvs
might
not
be
so
appealing
the
flavors
are
nicethough
i
found
the
pepper
profile
slightly
overpoweringand
leave
a
clean
citrus
feeling
in
the
mouth
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
midday
beer
as
a
break
from
the
august
honeydo
list
o
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
it
fits
good
for
the
season
considering
the
fact
that
its
currently
freezing
outside
i
figured
it
was
about
time
to
get
this
out
of
my
fridge
and
review
it
ive
had
this
probably
once
or
twice
a
year
for
the
past
couple
of
years
and
i
always
have
the
same
issue
it
lacks
balance
for
a
summer
beer
the
flavors
need
to
mellow
low
c
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
great
and
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
while
i
choose
not
to
partake
of
this
particular
draught
again
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
has
a
predilection
for
grapefruit
i
was
disappointed
by
summer
ale
but
sam
adams
has
a
good
selection
of
some
other
fairly
palatable
pilseners
and
beers
overall
very
good
beer
all
four
categories
are
well
accounted
for
the
only
thing
keeping
it
from
being
perfect
is
the
under
use
of
grain
it
tasted
like
peach
and
tires
but
without
the
bitterness
overall
i
have
found
that
for
my
personal
taste
ales
are
tastier
than
lagers
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
witbier
but
if
sasa
is
a
good
representation
of
the
american
pale
wheat
ale
style
im
going
to
strongly
consider
looking
for
them
as
opposed
to
straight
witbiers
very
very
tasty
about
what
i
expected
from
this
beer
not
that
interesting
but
perfectly
drinkable
b
3
5
overall
very
much
what
i
expected
it
to
be
middle
of
the
road
summer
lager
typical
of
samuel
adams
i
dont
know
i
figured
with
this
being
samuel
adams
it
would
be
good
but
wow
i
was
very
disappointed
or
adequate
to
quote
a
friend
overall
just
by
its
pale
almost
straw
appearance
this
beer
will
help
cool
you
off
as
well
provide
something
light
on
the
pallet
i
recommend
this
brew
as
one
of
those
beers
that
you
should
have
wioth
light
food
or
just
to
sit
outside
on
your
patio
and
drink
not
the
simple
quencher
that
i
expexted
from
this
drinkable
and
interesting
this
has
been
a
favorite
summer
beer
of
mine
since
i
started
drinking
its
got
that
nice
refreshing
summery
vibe
to
it
with
a
unique
lemony
zest
built
right
in
over
the
years
ive
found
myself
drinking
it
a
bit
less
than
i
used
to
to
be
fair
i
started
really
high
and
i
have
diversified
my
tastes
greatly
since
nevertheless
i
will
still
grab
one
of
these
from
time
to
time
and
enjoy
it
thoroughly
sam
adams
does
some
really
solid
seasonal
beers
i
bought
the
summer
mix
pack
because
it
was
hot
and
i
felt
like
a
summer
beer
sadly
im
reminded
why
i
avoid
sam
adamss
attempts
at
summer
beers
they
really
dont
have
enough
character
depth
and
being
flawless
in
execution
of
a
bad
beer
isnt
really
something
to
hang
your
hat
on
this
is
a
pleasant
example
of
an
american
wheat
beer
light
to
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
the
body
may
be
a
little
thick
for
the
style
but
is
certainly
light
enough
to
make
it
very
drinkable
the
carbonation
is
not
overly
apparent
and
seems
to
operate
more
in
the
background
light
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
very
easy
not
the
best
effort
from
sa
but
i
could
see
this
being
a
decent
hot
weather
beer
when
the
choices
are
limited
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
in
colorno
head
to
speak
of
with
light
lacing
of
the
glass
soft
lemon
citrus
taste
with
a
hint
of
spice
very
refreshing
with
a
pleasant
aftertaste
as
you
would
expect
for
a
summer
seasonal
on
tap
outback
steakhouse
springfield
nj
pours
a
nice
golden
pale
yellow
hue
with
a
nice
lasting
white
head
a
nice
citrus
and
lemon
aroma
with
some
wheat
and
light
grassy
notes
taste
is
sweet
citrus
and
lemon
peel
wheat
and
grassiness
with
some
light
malt
palate
is
light
bodied
with
a
nice
crisp
mouthful
and
light
carbonation
finish
light
sweet
malt
wheat
some
citrus
notes
ending
in
a
slight
lingering
nutty
flavor
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
summer
ale
drink
just
a
very
unique
summer
beer
way
to
lemony
and
tart
and
not
in
a
good
way
slight
wheaty
flavor
hits
your
mouth
first
then
is
overtaken
by
nicelybalanced
hops
and
some
lemon
zest
i
think
the
lemon
zest
is
a
tad
overdone
if
i
wanted
lemon
in
a
wheat
beer
id
put
it
in
there
myself
still
the
beer
is
quite
refreshing
nicely
priced
and
generally
easy
to
find
when
the
weather
gets
hot
it
gets
a
meh
overall
this
is
a
simple
but
refreshing
and
satisfying
beer
for
the
summer
time
just
average
i
could
definitely
pound
these
at
a
family
cookout
and
would
drink
them
if
available
but
dont
see
myself
picking
up
a
sixpack
again
anytime
soon
flavors
and
aromas
too
subtle
but
this
beer
would
probably
be
enjoyable
to
the
bmc
crowd
this
is
a
great
american
pale
wheat
and
its
quite
the
crowdpleaser
nice
silky
feel
from
the
wheat
and
it
even
speaks
of
a
flaked
grain
with
the
oily
bits
and
how
it
coats
the
tongue
in
short
this
beer
speaks
to
alot
of
folks
and
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that
or
this
beer
tasty
m
simple
yet
refreshing
carbonated
wet
with
decent
wheat
finish
another
good
beer
after
a
round
of
golf
or
that
cutting
the
lawn
thing
really
enjoyed
this
with
a
hibachi
dinner
tonight
it
is
a
good
introduction
beer
to
get
your
friends
out
of
the
typical
macros
unfortunately
it
is
lacking
too
much
in
flavor
for
most
beer
lovers
cheers
d
sort
of
reminds
you
of
a
really
clean
and
anodyne
wit
muted
wheat
minimal
haze
no
yeasty
notes
mild
spice
plentiful
lemon
approachable
bbq
beer
should
be
good
for
getting
folks
to
think
of
something
other
than
macro
swill
better
with
food
than
on
its
own
not
a
bad
beer
i
had
thought
i
didnt
like
this
that
much
but
it
must
have
been
their
winter
lager
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
for
the
summer
anyways
it
smells
of
wheat
and
lemon
and
pretty
much
follows
that
on
the
taste
mouth
is
substantial
with
just
enough
body
overall
this
is
am
easy
drinker
for
hot
days
and
nights
and
someone
new
to
craft
beer
might
be
able
to
enjoy
this
simple
summer
ale
a
nice
drinkable
beer
very
satisfying
and
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
boy
these
are
thirstquenching
not
too
sweet
so
perfect
to
complement
a
summer
afternoon
or
evening
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
slightly
bland
flavours
and
aromas
a
bit
too
lemony
for
my
liking
overall
one
of
the
better
summer
ales
if
you
rate
this
for
overall
appeal
it
falls
in
line
with
many
of
the
others
out
there
but
for
a
summer
ale
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
interesting
refreshing
session
beer
but
nothing
special
o
avg
at
best
sometimes
the
only
non
bmc
available
but
nothing
i
would
ever
seek
out
overall
not
a
bad
summer
brew
nice
an
refreshing
not
too
heavy
very
enjoyable
and
nice
part
of
the
summer
sampler
another
solid
offering
from
boston
beer
not
amazing
but
pretty
tasty
refreshing
a
nice
summer
session
beer
final
thoughts
its
alright
nothing
special
but
i
suppose
they
cater
to
a
pretty
wide
audience
o
im
not
a
big
fan
there
are
much
better
wheat
ales
and
much
better
summer
seasonals
that
i
prefer
my
least
favorate
sam
adams
brew
to
date
just
to
much
lemon
as
i
said
many
times
i
know
alot
of
people
that
enjoy
thisits
just
not
for
me
orangey
body
that
lacks
cloudiness
but
has
a
nice
white
head
that
drops
quickly
to
a
nonlacing
ring
notes
of
orange
and
lemon
peel
and
spice
pepper
are
on
the
nose
the
body
follows
up
with
much
the
same
and
could
be
described
as
refreshing
hence
the
summer
i
suppose
the
fruitiness
tastes
a
little
pithy
to
me
though
a
little
viscous
with
a
very
heavy
bite
from
the
carbonation
finishes
cleanly
nothing
special
and
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
actually
thought
that
it
tasted
much
better
before
it
warmed
and
the
spice
kicked
in
m
went
down
smooth
like
a
summer
beer
should
would
have
liked
more
of
the
lemon
sensation
in
its
sourness
or
bitterness
was
just
a
note
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
it
is
sessionable
and
refreshing
way
to
go
jim
keep
putting
out
horrible
beer
i
give
two
schlitz
about
samuel
adams
summer
ale
this
could
be
the
lcbos
fault
as
the
beer
was
bottled
over
2
months
ago
and
likely
stored
improperly
along
the
way
but
this
is
a
huge
letdown
after
trying
the
noble
pils
in
the
springtime
will
give
it
another
shot
if
i
see
it
on
tap
but
this
one
literally
left
me
with
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
o
overall
not
a
bad
summer
beer
for
a
hot
day
easily
sessionable
i
dont
know
that
i
would
seek
this
one
out
its
probably
one
of
the
most
disappointing
seasonals
from
boston
beer
co
it
was
the
best
beer
that
grottos
had
on
tap
at
the
time
so
no
regrets
here
onot
a
bad
interpretation
of
the
style
really
nothing
exciting
or
unique
with
this
beer
but
im
not
a
real
fan
of
this
style
i
much
prefer
a
saison
or
a
pilsner
for
a
good
summer
time
drink
it
is
definetly
refreshing
and
its
spicy
and
sweet
gets
a
bit
tiresome
to
drink
but
i
guess
id
drink
it
again
malty
taste
slight
hops
orange
peel
againcitrus
good
carbonation
and
drinkability
overall
was
pretty
average
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
quickly
dissipating
head
aroma
is
slightly
toasted
crackery
grain
lemon
and
just
a
slightly
spicy
note
really
slight
lemon
and
grain
on
the
front
followed
by
a
bit
of
spice
again
just
a
slight
bit
and
then
a
long
persistent
bitter
finish
not
really
a
pleasantly
floral
hop
bitterness
bit
more
of
an
acrid
bitterness
carbonation
is
a
bit
unrefined
as
well
i
wanted
something
a
little
creamier
given
the
style
definitely
not
one
of
boston
beers
finest
although
i
remain
a
fan
of
some
of
their
other
stuff
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
this
would
be
a
much
better
beer
without
the
inclusion
of
the
lemon
peel
as
it
is
im
left
with
more
of
a
lemon
pledge
sensation
in
my
mouth
than
summer
refreshment
not
a
bad
beer
beer
but
certainly
not
one
of
my
favorite
seasonal
offerings
from
sam
adams
do
this
wheat
beer
takes
a
few
plays
from
the
belgian
book
incorporating
the
clean
citrus
and
spice
notes
from
the
flavor
adjuncts
it
features
while
yeast
stays
politely
out
of
the
picture
flavors
are
appropriate
to
the
style
and
the
seasonal
theme
but
may
be
constrained
by
the
need
to
not
offend
overall
a
decent
summer
refresher
probably
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
out
again
but
still
decent
o
overall
not
a
very
good
addition
to
the
style
bland
notes
of
hay
and
grass
not
one
of
the
best
from
sam
adams
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
pours
a
deep
golden
straw
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
cap
spicy
aroma
that
smells
of
lemon
pepper
and
sweet
malts
taste
is
sweet
with
honey
like
malts
lemon
and
pepper
and
that
spicy
wheat
taste
moderate
level
of
carbonation
medium
body
slick
sweet
mouthfeel
nice
summer
ale
if
not
a
bit
boring
not
bad
but
nothing
i
would
regularly
seek
out
o
there
were
some
nice
flavors
but
nothing
really
stood
out
it
was
a
refreshing
brew
though
my
sample
poured
a
2
offwhite
head
body
is
an
attractive
hazy
sunny
yellow
smells
faintly
of
malt
and
citrus
taste
to
me
though
falls
into
fairly
standard
bmc
style
the
lemon
peel
is
barely
a
suggestion
during
the
drink
and
a
little
stronger
in
the
finish
theres
a
moderate
acidic
zing
in
the
finish
and
i
suspect
thats
the
grains
of
paradise
pepper
you
know
ive
heard
some
comment
summer
ales
dont
always
come
out
the
same
way
and
i
think
this
is
the
case
clearly
some
reviewers
got
a
whole
lot
more
or
whole
lot
less
out
of
their
samples
overall
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
flavor
for
such
great
drinkability
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
the
last
year
or
so
and
is
a
true
summer
favorite
of
mine
buy
a
sixer
at
least
and
give
it
a
shot
m
o
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
bodied
slightly
watery
feel
that
is
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
decent
lemon
flavored
summer
beer
even
though
i
would
prefer
leinies
summer
shandy
over
this
i
tasted
of
citrus
some
wheat
bread
yeast
it
was
pretty
light
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
but
was
a
very
nice
summer
beer
great
for
the
sand
easy
drinker
and
serves
its
purpose
well
as
a
summer
beer
i
think
its
a
great
and
somewhat
unique
flavor
for
a
summer
brew
its
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
is
my
personal
favorite
of
the
sam
seasonals
it
does
seem
to
taste
a
little
different
to
me
this
year
though
as
though
they
may
have
tweaked
the
recipe
a
tiny
bit
this
year
could
be
wrong
though
the
beer
is
mostly
clear
and
appears
golden
yellow
in
color
the
head
is
minimal
thanks
to
a
most
generous
pour
from
a
gracious
bartender
the
aroma
is
weak
with
some
hints
of
lemon
the
flavor
is
akin
to
lemon
pledge
not
digging
it
the
beer
tastes
of
artificial
additives
the
back
half
is
just
too
odd
and
artificial
for
me
to
enjoy
not
a
repeat
for
me
sam
summer
is
a
nice
zesty
beer
most
summer
beers
tend
to
be
wheat
ales
that
lean
to
the
lighter
and
fruitier
side
but
ol
sammy
aint
holdin
back
this
is
a
full
bodied
summer
there
are
nice
citrus
flavors
mixed
in
with
the
full
boddiedness
that
is
kindred
to
sams
boston
lagar
i
really
like
all
of
sam
adams
seasonals
and
the
summer
ale
hangs
with
the
best
of
em
o
i
used
to
enjoy
this
much
more
but
lately
find
other
much
better
summer
seasonals
this
is
a
good
beer
to
start
that
bbq
with
before
you
move
on
smells
inoffensive
looks
allright
citric
acid
taste
with
a
finish
reminiscent
of
medicinal
alcohol
give
me
the
good
old
fashioned
sam
adams
d
not
something
i
would
go
back
for
finishing
one
feels
a
bit
like
a
labor
there
are
way
better
summer
ales
out
there
heavy
seas
comes
to
mind
this
is
another
example
of
a
bad
use
of
flavorings
by
boston
beer
company
do
not
my
favorite
style
but
their
are
some
great
examples

little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
and
this
one
doesnt
even
compare
others
may
like
this
one
bmcers
but
i
dont
care
for
it
much
d
zestiness
comes
through
in
the
nose
but
on
the
palate
it
never
really
gets
going
a
little
malty
sweetness
dying
and
this
zestiness
that
comes
up
the
back
trying
to
provide
balance
but
its
too
late
not
one
i
would
consider
a
first
choice
summer
beer
overall
0
5
points
added
for
being
drinkable
and
even
a
bit
refreshing
the
pour
netted
a
finger
of
rocky
offwhite
head
that
was
burbling
and
bubbling
its
way
out
of
existence
pretty
quickly
color
was
an
ohsoslightly
hazy
golden
yellow
suggesting
that
they
did
not
filter
the
life
out
of
it
like
that
extra
clear
blue
moon
summer
wack
nonsense
nose
was
initially
lemon
citrusy
but
then
i
got
a
real
whiff
of
those
grains
of
paradise
and
i
felt
like
i
had
inhaled
black
pepper
zounds
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
not
quite
creamy
but
close
this
tasted
really
good
especially
after
those
last
two
summer
losers
with
an
initial
lemon
citrusiness
that
quickly
got
out
of
the
way
for
those
grains
of
paradise
which
filled
my
sinuses
like
there
was
room
or
i
wanted
them
there
i
kid
you
not
i
was
so
close
to
a
sneezing
fit
that
it
was
not
funny
finish
was
pleasantly
dry
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
it
is
not
in
a
can
and
bottles
are
frowned
upon
at
many
summer
destinations
loyalty
to
sam
is
not
unlike
loyalty
to
the
red
sox
i
guess
i
wont
go
away
will
just
hope
for
better
o
this
a
very
good
summer
ale
it
s
refreshing
like
a
summer
ale
should
be
much
better
than
coastal
wheat
overall
really
middle
of
the
road
beer
for
me
here
not
getting
much
out
of
this
one
overall
this
is
a
solid
session
beer
one
i
will
enjoy
with
the
love
of
my
life
this
is
her
favorite
beer
not
bad
but
not
the
best
i
have
had
when
it
come
to
wheat
beers
note
i
love
bbc
but
i
had
to
drainpour
the
final
4
oz
or
so
this
got
gross
o
the
dry
crisp
taste
is
refreshing
but
the
soapy
notes
and
lemon
pepper
flavor
are
to
strong
and
dont
have
any
support
making
this
a
bit
rough
to
finish
a
glass
the
flavors
described
on
the
bottle
are
all
there
but
that
is
all
that
is
there
a
very
unique
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
still
very
delicious
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
and
certainly
more
interesting
than
some
other
summer
beers
ive
had
this
year
id
pick
it
up
again
though
id
rather
see
what
else
i
could
find
first
food
match
chinese
food
mixed
with
mexican
cuisine
might
just
work
with
this
kind
of
a
biting
carbonation
not
the
smooth
summer
quencher
i
was
looking
for
interesting
attempt
but
not
for
me
o
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
one
i
can
have
a
few
of
without
the
taste
becoming
overpowering
or
bland
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
american
wheat
ale
poured
a
cloudy
orange
color
and
it
produced
a
white
head
the
head
retention
for
this
ale
was
very
poor
especially
for
a
boston
beer
company
product
the
ale
did
leave
behind
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
of
the
ale
consisted
of
light
wheat
lemon
and
yeast
the
beer
is
light
in
body
and
is
very
smooth
the
taste
was
a
very
soft
wheat
with
citrus
lemon
and
a
slightly
spicy
finish
the
spice
could
be
coriander
and
pepper
overall
an
average
beer
a
bit
below
of
what
i
am
used
to
when
it
comes
to
the
sam
adams
line
the
summer
ale
by
sammy
a
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
there
are
many
other
summer
beers
i
would
choose
over
this
one
the
appearance
is
a
pale
yellow
with
white
head
that
laced
nicely
the
smell
is
dominated
by
lemon
citrus
the
taste
leaned
on
the
acidic
side
and
was
not
overly
refreshing
to
me
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
if
you
like
a
tartness
to
your
beer
style
that
typically
goes
down
easy
for
hours
i
never
desire
more
than
one
of
these
o
i
would
recommend
this
the
grains
of
paradise
is
a
nice
unique
touch
that
makes
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
runofthemill
american
pale
wheat
ale
the
lemon
rind
compliments
the
overall
flavor
nicely
as
well
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
summer
beer
i
think
this
is
a
good
choice
overall
interesting
but
not
my
speed
the
peppery
flavors
throw
the
whole
beer
off
for
me
o
an
ok
summer
brew
nothing
i
would
grab
for
all
the
time
though
summary
i
am
a
disappointed
in
this
sam
adams
not
that
there
is
anything
necessarily
wrong
with
it
but
nothing
really
impressed
me
it
is
a
balanced
brew
and
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
not
much
else
to
say
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
big
2
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
random
splotches
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
wheat
citrus
zest
and
spices
taste
of
of
wheat
and
spices
with
a
slightly
bitter
citrus
zest
finish
mild
hop
bitterness
quickly
fades
between
sips
this
beer
has
a
lower
carbonation
level
with
a
crisp
but
slightly
thick
mouthfeeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
my
wife
really
liked
this
one
so
i
bet
this
is
going
to
be
a
staple
in
our
fridge
this
season
this
brew
pours
a
pale
honey
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
heaps
of
lacingthe
smell
is
lemon
zestcitrus
and
peppery
hopsit
has
a
light
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
smell
with
lemon
zestpungent
citruslight
toffee
and
finished
with
a
hit
of
dryspicypeppery
hops
and
overall
a
nice
summer
drop
but
thats
it
for
me
cheers
o
a
great
summer
pounder
that
has
any
number
of
fond
associations
for
me
nostalgia
aside
its
a
solid
summer
beer
that
im
happy
to
see
on
tap
throughout
the
barosphere
this
time
of
year
cheers
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
light
malty
aroma
lemony
grainy
typical
wheat
bite
in
the
mouth
with
obvious
lemon
and
peppery
spice
a
little
harshness
to
it
but
for
a
major
label
not
a
bad
beer
good
balance
of
flavors
light
bodied
and
easily
drinkable
best
in
summertime
obviously
d
good
summer
drink
something
i
would
consider
picking
up
but
would
most
likely
pass
on
if
there
were
other
options
to
consider
overall
this
beer
has
a
few
good
points
but
they
are
mostly
blown
away
by
the
inappropriateness
of
this
grain
in
this
beer
im
sure
it
would
work
well
in
a
saison
but
in
this
beer
it
is
neither
particularly
tasty
nor
refreshing
overall
bad
beer
that
seems
to
want
to
be
refreshing
as
well
as
interesting
and
a
bit
esoteric
fails
on
both
counts
not
too
many
distinct
flavors
and
they
get
tiresome
early
on
plus
it
simply
is
not
refreshing
the
pepper
and
unpleasant
bitterness
are
too
prominent
i
highly
prefer
water
to
this
overall
it
is
less
than
i
would
expect
for
a
summer
ale
but
well
suited
for
a
hot
afternoon
with
the
promise
of
many
beer
enjoying
hours
o
a
nice
little
refreshing
summer
ale
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
could
drink
one
after
another
from
bottle
or
glass
this
is
a
beer
you
give
to
your
bmc
drinking
friends
to
help
them
see
the
light
overall
while
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
dont
feel
it
represents
summer
in
any
way
i
feel
the
spices
are
more
suited
to
an
autumn
brew
there
are
just
too
many
good
summer
beers
out
there
to
waste
your
time
on
this
one
overall
an
ok
beer
good
for
bbqs
to
get
other
non
beer
drinkers
into
beer
i
guess
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
tumbler
best
by
sept
pours
a
very
pale
stray
color
with
two
fingers
of
light
foam
and
lots
of
big
bubbly
carbonation
minimal
lacing
lemon
and
yeast
on
the
nose
with
a
little
malty
sweetness
mouthfeel
has
good
carbonation
but
there
is
a
syrupy
texture
that
is
off
putting
palate
is
sweet
spicy
and
mildly
bitter
like
a
lager
lemon
and
honey
notes
not
really
my
cup
o
tea
cant
imagine
it
being
anyone
elses
either
hazy
bright
yellow
with
a
large
amount
of
bubbly
head
it
dissipates
quickly
however
to
leave
almost
nothing
a
lot
of
spice
in
the
nose
with
a
some
lemon
and
sweet
wheat
malt
the
flavor
is
an
extremely
tangy
lemon
zest
with
a
malty
sweet
but
spicy
middle
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
from
the
yeast
and
lemon
i
have
to
drink
them
quickly
because
once
it
got
slightly
warm
it
was
harder
to
put
down
o
oppressive
herbal
note
comes
off
almost
like
cleaning
fluid
if
the
not
was
toned
down
to
about
70
of
its
current
intensity
i
think
itd
be
a
much
better
beer
o
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
wouldnt
treat
summer
ale
as
a
special
beer
to
drink
when
celebrating
something
but
it
tastes
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
drink
during
hot
summers
everything
except
the
taste
is
good
for
a
lawnmower
beer
but
the
pith
flavor
really
sucked
i
mean
really
sucked
hard
overall
impression
i
was
hoping
samuel
adams
summer
ale
was
going
to
be
superb
not
the
case
the
hype
was
about
this
beer
inside
the
bar
and
when
i
went
to
go
swim
and
drink
this
beer
i
wasnt
satisfied
at
all
would
say
that
you
could
drink
many
in
a
day
for
those
who
are
expecting
a
totally
different
beer
but
i
actually
struggled
to
finish
this
one
once
again
nothing
against
samuel
adams
but
this
didnt
hit
the
style
well
o
i
guess
an
ok
summer
ale
the
citrus
comes
through
too
strong
d
dont
know
if
this
is
extremely
sessionable
due
to
the
pepperiness
but
it
is
very
good
and
unique
a
nice
change
to
summer
wheat
beers
strays
more
savory
than
the
typical
sweet
mehhh
suitable
for
quenching
ones
thirst
at
an
airport
while
waiting
for
ones
flight
during
a
storm
delay
but
not
really
much
else
cant
imagine
ordering
this
one
again
any
time
soon
o
alright
at
the
very
best
my
impressions
of
sam
adams
have
always
been
that
its
a
brewery
with
a
good
heart
but
a
salesmans
brain
its
capitalism
at
its
finest
show
commercials
that
insinuate
your
product
is
made
with
tons
of
the
best
ingredients
and
care
then
watch
your
cheaplymade
product
fly
off
the
shelves
hopefully
i
find
something
in
the
sam
adams
lineup
that
doesnt
cost
150
per
bottle
mind
you
which
will
change
my
mind
for
now
though
my
opinion
remains
unchanged
overall
its
an
ok
flavoring
not
very
refreshing
but
still
easy
to
drink
rather
disappointing
to
be
honest
barely
acceptable
if
offerred
nothing
complex
or
exciting
here
but
this
beer
is
a
fine
refresher
on
a
summers
day
its
a
toned
down
drinkable
version
of
all
the
lemonlime
abominations
that
are
on
the
market
now
t
this
was
pretty
refreshing
with
some
light
grain
and
pale
malt
flavor
along
with
a
light
bit
of
lemon
it
wasnt
mindblowing
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
light
but
there
could
be
a
place
for
this
in
the
summertime
o
its
ok
not
bad
but
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
it
not
bad
on
a
hot
day
outside
which
is
where
i
had
this
one
but
plenty
of
other
beer
out
there
i
would
prefer
below
average
offering
here
just
not
much
flavor
and
what
there
is
isnt
very
good
has
that
strange
underlying
flavor
and
is
also
watery
id
have
been
disappointed
had
i
bought
this
alone
rather
than
part
of
a
package
deal
i
thought
id
had
bad
beer
before
colt
45
pearl
that
had
turned
but
this
one
beat
them
all
imagine
a
glass
of
goat
urine
with
a
lemonrind
pitched
in
its
baaad
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
very
brisk
the
carbonation
level
is
very
high
here
the
drinkability
is
actually
fairly
low
due
to
the
sweetness
i
wish
this
was
toned
down
a
bit
overall
the
most
disappointing
seasonal
ive
had
from
sam
adams
it
could
be
a
really
good
beer
with
some
tweaking
but
is
just
average
as
it
stands
the
only
redeeming
aspect
is
with
how
pretty
the
beer
is
the
coloring
was
nice
and
the
lacing
looks
really
good
at
the
end
a
lot
of
people
i
know
really
dont
like
this
beer
at
all
they
claim
its
too
perfumey
i
dont
really
feel
that
this
beer
is
a
bad
summer
brew
at
all
the
beer
pours
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
decent
sized
white
head
that
leaves
a
pretty
nice
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
bright
and
fresh
its
got
some
lemon
in
there
and
perhaps
a
few
spices
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
citrusy
and
grainy
blast
of
freshness
its
a
little
sweet
and
its
got
a
good
balance
of
fruit
and
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
easy
going
lightly
carbonated
and
soft
this
beer
is
a
great
for
a
hot
day
in
the
summer
to
kill
off
the
heat
i
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
one
here
and
there
is
usually
enough
another
wellmade
and
very
light
beer
from
bbc
though
one
of
my
least
favorites
i
think
it
is
much
improved
mixed
with
rampage
dipa
inoffensive
but
forgettable
appearance
is
a
darkish
yellow
with
a
fuzzy
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
not
much
cloudiness
like
some
wheat
beers
although
that
isnt
unusual
for
american
beers
in
that
category
smell
is
of
wheat
and
some
malts
not
too
complex
but
decent
the
taste
up
front
is
rather
pleasant
wheat
and
spice
combine
for
something
light
but
not
bland
it
is
the
aftertaste
that
gets
me
it
is
overwhelmingly
sour
almost
soapy
maybe
it
was
just
a
bad
batch
but
it
is
hard
for
me
to
overcome
the
aftertaste
that
brings
the
beer
down
considerably
o
this
beer
is
balanced
really
well
all
the
different
tastes
blend
together
nicely
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
coming
into
this
beer
but
it
surprised
me
on
how
good
it
was
this
would
hit
the
spot
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
too
bad
we
cant
get
this
in
canada
o
this
is
okay
it
is
very
drinkable
but
not
very
flavorful
overall
a
good
version
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
nice
balance
of
malts
and
citrus
an
ok
summer
beer
but
there
are
a
lot
better
seasonal
options
out
there
than
this
not
bad
if
this
is
your
only
craft
option
at
a
restaurant
or
bbq
but
there
are
better
options
lots
of
better
attempts
out
there
than
this
a
simple
lager
would
be
better
and
less
offensive
than
this
overall
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
beer
so
i
cant
compare
it
to
previous
years
but
this
is
probably
one
of
the
better
summer
seasonals
out
there
and
probably
the
best
american
wheat
ale
ive
had
so
far
lemons
be
darned
if
the
lemons
were
a
little
more
balanced
with
the
other
flavors
and
not
as
artificial
id
give
it
a
higher
grade
but
it
gets
kinda
gross
after
the
beer
warms
worth
a
try
though
dont
know
why
i
get
jazzed
to
drink
this
every
year
i
had
it
on
tap
once
in
the
desert
phoenix
and
it
tasted
so
good
its
never
that
hot
here
so
i
ponder
but
anyway
i
can
like
this
as
a
great
companion
to
grilled
bbq
food
with
respectable
flavor
for
a
summer
wheat
but
thought
they
used
to
leave
more
tasty
floaties
behind
and
why
is
sam
approaching
40cs
here
in
pa
a
refreshing
summer
beer
no
doubt
the
aroma
is
better
than
the
taste
but
not
by
much
i
like
it
but
i
think
their
spring
seasonal
nobile
pils
will
be
missed
more
than
this
summer
seasonal
the
rest
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
a
summer
ale
much
more
body
but
with
a
fair
amount
of
citrus
stuff
going
on
overall
pretty
decent
its
not
one
of
their
best
beers
by
any
means
nor
is
it
one
of
their
better
seasonal
releases
but
its
still
a
refreshing
beer
to
have
on
occasion
nothing
worth
buying
a
6pack
of
but
still
enjoyable
when
it
needs
to
be
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
at
times
i
would
recommend
working
through
a
sixpack
to
decide
if
you
like
it
or
not
oi
like
sour
beers
but
this
has
a
tangyness
to
it
that
makes
this
one
difficult
to
drink
in
my
opinion
i
can
see
how
this
might
be
up
some
bas
alley
but
not
mine
this
is
one
of
the
worst
offering
of
the
style
that
ive
ever
had
presented
well
for
the
style
very
drinkable
pours
a
dark
yellow
with
a
faint
white
head
that
dissipates
fast
smell
is
very
wheaty
with
a
slight
lemoncitrus
smell
very
fruity
hint
at
the
end
of
the
taste
with
a
wheat
taste
as
well
very
crisp
and
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
great
for
summer
very
simple
overall
it
will
still
be
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
outside
in
the
sun
d
it
starts
out
very
promising
with
a
nice
spicy
and
fruity
character
but
things
really
fall
apart
in
the
finish
it
gets
really
medicinal
and
almost
burnt
tasting
with
a
stale
spice
character
that
lingers
long
after
all
of
the
pleasant
aspects
have
faded
away
too
bad
really
some
flaws
in
flavor
and
aroma
but
all
in
all
a
fairly
average
offering
of
a
sometimes
boring
style
o
okay
i
know
lots
of
people
really
dont
get
excited
about
pale
wheat
ales
myself
included
except
gumballhead
and
there
seems
to
be
a
consensus
that
boston
beer
company
almosts
always
comes
in
as
second
best
or
below
but
this
beer
has
a
few
things
going
for
it
1
very
light
and
refreshing
for
hot
summer
days
2
the
spiciness
from
the
grains
of
paradise
is
pretty
unique
and
well
showcased
in
this
beer
so
i
think
ill
see
this
one
in
the
fridge
again
o
overall
an
ok
beer
but
i
buy
them
basically
to
have
around
for
people
who
arent
really
that
into
craft
beer
because
i
dont
keep
any
bmc
products
at
my
house
o
overall
this
is
a
simplistic
brew
without
much
to
offer
thats
not
to
say
its
bad
but
in
my
opinion
it
didnt
live
up
to
its
potential
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
flavor
and
a
bit
of
substance
maybe
something
that
would
break
outside
of
the
realm
of
being
just
another
samuel
adams
beer
that
said
it
is
drinkable
and
better
than
most
massproduced
american
offerings
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
the
feel
of
this
beer
on
my
pallet
was
not
as
pleasant
as
most
of
the
beers
i
have
tried
from
samuel
adams
i
was
rather
disappointed
actually
i
expected
more
the
aroma
smelled
like
most
standard
wheat
beers
in
my
opinion
this
beer
was
mediocre
at
best
o
d
well
id
been
reading
about
how
this
beer
has
gone
downhill
this
year
but
i
dont
know
that
ive
had
it
before
so
i
cant
refer
to
anything
however
i
can
imagine
that
it
used
to
be
better
its
alright
but
theres
so
many
better
summer
beers
o
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
one
its
an
average
pwa
not
necessarily
bad
but
not
really
one
id
like
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
you
wouldnt
need
to
look
further
then
this
brewery
for
a
better
summer
beer
that
being
said
i
had
no
issues
finishing
it
or
the
one
after
it
for
that
matter
but
i
doubt
ill
be
buying
another
6er
when
its
on
the
shelf
beside
their
nobel
pils
for
the
same
price
o
i
never
much
cared
for
this
beer
before
i
had
this
one
tonight
not
sure
if
my
palate
has
changed
that
much
since
i
have
had
one
or
if
this
if
this
beer
has
changed
there
is
a
nice
tropical
fruit
taste
and
aroma
to
this
beer
that
i
dont
remember
before
and
not
as
much
graininess
as
i
remember
overall
i
remembered
liking
last
years
summer
ale
i
probably
would
have
given
last
years
a
b
to
b
but
this
is
very
underwhelming
especially
compared
to
what
i
remember
i
judged
this
on
its
own
without
the
comparison
to
last
year
and
just
going
off
of
what
i
am
seeing
smelling
and
tasting
currently
and
i
am
not
a
fan
this
is
the
second
sam
adams
seasonal
in
a
row
that
i
have
been
extremely
disappointed
with
pours
a
transparent
golden
color
with
lasting
visible
carbonation
an
average
pour
yielded
a
1
finger
white
head
head
slowly
dissipated
to
a
thick
film
on
top
of
my
beer
but
it
gives
off
no
lacing
smell
is
of
wheat
malt
and
slight
amounts
of
lemon
taste
has
starts
off
with
slight
sweetness
from
the
wheat
then
it
finishes
with
a
slightly
spicy
note
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
overall
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
it
is
pretty
average
for
a
apwa
the
taste
is
relatively
simple
but
that
is
okay
with
me
it
just
fills
a
different
niche
share
this
with
a
friend
who
doesnt
drink
craft
beer
o
a
below
average
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
overall
a
beer
i
simply
dont
enjoy
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
a
bit
filling
compared
to
something
like
the
goose
island
summertime
fantastic
for
the
golf
course
and
summertime
grilling
overall
few
will
mistake
this
for
a
world
class
beer
and
it
generally
doesnt
garner
a
lot
of
love
from
bas
however
i
find
it
reasonably
flavorful
and
refreshing
pairing
well
with
its
season
namesake
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
overall
drinkability
the
bitter
sourness
ruins
this
beer
overall
i
would
never
purchase
this
beer
again
and
would
almost
prefer
a
bmc
overall
not
impressed
i
dont
know
why
but
i
expected
this
to
be
a
little
bit
better
than
it
was
the
sam
adams
seasonals
tend
to
be
decent
and
well
this
was
pretty
much
a
macrolager
on
a
craft
tap
i
wouldnt
bother
cheers
poured
a
strawyellow
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
that
quickly
disapated
aromas
of
malt
wheat
and
a
touch
of
citruslemon
taste
was
ok
malt
lemon
a
bit
of
biscut
and
no
bitterness
at
all
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
like
any
other
bmc
brew
not
bad
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
definitely
better
on
draft
o
didnt
care
for
it
probably
would
not
get
again
not
my
favorite
one
of
this
style
there
are
some
really
tastefully
done
american
wheats
that
showcase
a
citrusfruity
vibe
out
there
and
this
is
not
one
of
them
o
not
my
bag
baby
the
finish
is
almost
unbearable
everything
else
is
fine
but
i
cant
stand
the
way
this
leaves
my
mouth
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
nothing
up
front
with
a
mild
sweetness
on
the
finish
there
is
a
grainy
aftertaste
that
really
takes
me
out
of
the
beer
i
had
500
ml
of
this
why
was
this
served
in
500
ml
glasses
and
that
was
more
than
enough
id
have
it
again
if
it
were
the
only
beer
at
the
party
and
my
alcoholism
needed
to
be
fed
otherwise
id
pass
pours
just
under
a
two
finger
head
made
up
of
whispy
white
suds
unlike
other
beers
where
the
head
is
somewhat
offwhite
summer
ale
is
a
soild
white
the
beer
itself
is
a
light
straw
color
with
v
some
lacingery
high
levels
of
carbonation
champagne
levels
the
smell
is
malt
dominate
with
vanilla
lemon
citrus
and
a
touch
of
coriander
and
spice
at
the
finish
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
but
with
a
nice
citrus
and
spice
note
at
the
end
overall
i
love
this
beer
for
summer
d
extremely
drinkable
super
crisp
and
refreshing
the
flavors
are
could
use
a
touch
of
kick
but
they
are
far
from
empty
and
well
balanced
o
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
ill
be
buying
again
soon
a
decent
flavoursome
wheat
ale
with
nice
flavours
its
a
little
over
the
top
and
id
like
a
bit
less
of
the
lemon
and
spice
o
at
first
i
didnt
care
much
for
this
beer
but
sip
by
sip
i
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
i
purchased
the
summer
sampler
and
was
least
excited
about
this
one
and
sam
adams
light
but
its
good
i
prefer
boulevard
but
still
its
a
good
beer
something
different
i
could
see
why
people
would
go
either
way
with
this
beer
because
on
the
initial
sip
you
get
that
crisp
lemon
wheat
beer
that
people
would
expect
but
then
ends
with
that
bitter
like
grains
of
paradise
taste
i
really
like
it
and
i
will
drink
this
beer
throughout
the
whole
summer
oa
every
year
you
seem
to
get
something
different
with
this
seasonal
release
and
this
year
i
think
sams
got
it
right
bottle
dated
with
best
consumed
by
august
2011
and
it
reminds
me
of
their
2006
release
d
outstanding
i
can
say
this
brew
has
plently
of
complexity
and
flavor
for
the
beer
geek
but
wouldnt
offend
too
many
macro
drinkers
either
i
am
very
impressed
the
bbc
has
improved
the
finish
from
last
seasons
the
only
knock
and
this
is
coming
from
a
light
weight
go
ahead
send
me
an
email
and
call
me
a
wussy
is
that
the
abv
may
be
a
tad
high
for
the
style
its
just
too
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
too
many
of
these
o
i
have
had
sam
adams
summer
in
the
past
and
to
be
honest
it
has
gotten
worse
over
the
years
the
2010
summer
batch
was
lame
and
the
2011
batch
is
even
worse
i
wont
be
buying
any
six
packs
this
summer
and
i
will
give
away
the
summers
if
i
buy
a
12
pack
mix
o
ok
so
i
realise
im
going
to
be
well
down
on
the
deviation
for
this
review
but
this
beer
is
really
not
that
great
its
got
a
massive
hit
of
lemon
which
drowns
out
everything
else
in
pretty
much
every
category
tastes
like
someone
has
taken
a
decent
ale
and
poured
a
heap
of
processed
lemon
juice
into
it
not
impressed
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
notched
at
aug
pours
a
slightly
hazy
slightly
translucent
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
of
lemon
peel
spices
bread
and
slightly
floral
taste
is
mostly
of
lemon
and
grains
a
bit
bready
lemon
peel
aftertaste
definitely
tastes
like
a
wheat
beer
but
a
bit
more
grainy
than
id
like
somewhat
drinkable
but
i
find
the
wheat
and
lemon
combination
a
bit
too
harsh
overall
its
alright
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
on
its
own
do
it
definitely
fits
the
summer
style
well
and
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
once
you
let
the
carbonation
die
down
a
bit
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
that
expires
august
2011
sampled
on
april

2011
the
pour
is
a
hazy
pale
yelloworange
combination
with
a
short
bursting
fizzy
white
head
the
goes
away
quickly
the
aroma
highlights
the
lemon
zest
and
grains
far
beyond
anything
wheat
like
the
taste
is
summer
tart
with
a
zing
of
lemon
black
pepper
and
a
moderate
hop
note
at
the
end
the
wheat
taste
is
downplayed
too
much
this
is
the
quintessential
summer
beer
the
ale
has
a
very
smooth
ale
feeling
to
it
and
does
not
leave
your
mouth
dry
the
flavor
has
a
nice
fruit
taste
without
over
powering
you
with
too
much
sweetness
some
places
garnish
this
one
with
fruit
but
i
like
it
as
it
is
cheers
overall
this
indeed
comes
off
as
a
good
summer
beer
to
bad
i
got
this
off
season
id
say
its
worth
a
try
good
to
different
varieties
of
sam
adams
coming
to
canada
or
at
least
western
canada
notes
you
can
find

beers
out

use
this

as
a
guide
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
very
good
qualities
good
color
nice
citrus
smell
very
summery
very
drinkable
as
well
the
taste
is
very
unique
you
get
the
wheat
and
you
get
a
lot
of
different
fruit
and
other
tastes
you
can
taste
the
grains
of
paradise
and
all
the
fruit
they
mix
in
all
in
all
its
not
outstanding
but
a
very
good
wheat
beer
non
the
less
i
will
get
this
one
again
d
easy
to
drink
refreshing
d
the

is
decent
it
goes
down
fairly
smooth
and
itd
be
easy

drink
a

of
this
in
a
sitting
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
its
a
beer
im
glad
i
got
the

this
isnt
exactly
my
favorite

i
want
to

something

to
cover

the
strong

flavor
probably
wont
buy
again
d
drinkability

low

artificial

is
almost

sour
and
not
in

may
be
good

beer
in

but
i
cant
see
me
searching
it
out
again
d
i
didnt
order
another
so
take
what
you
will
from

d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
picked
it
up
with
several
other
sas
in
a
build
your
own
deal
at
a
grocery
store
this
beer
is
more
complex
than
a
summer
seasonal
needs
to
be
nothing
wrong
with
that
of
course
but
its
a
pretty
bold
move
to
put
out
a
murky
com
plex
ale
for
a
summer

everyone

is

i
give
the
brewer
credit
for
trying
something
different
than
a
standard
american
wheat
style
but
i
dont
care
for
the
heavyhanded
strange
combination
of
spices
not
too
much
citrus
hops
just
right
quality
average
summer
ale
exactly
what
id
expect
from
samuel
adams
give
it
a
try
might
have
to
wait
until
next
year
overall
this
is
a
weak
showing

rated
it
a
b

above
not

by
the
beer
at
all
in

i
only
had
it
a

the
drink

asked

he
came
back
with
the
summer
crap
ill
wait
for
the
winter
bock
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
haze
and
a
several
finger
white
head
although
this
doesnt
leave
behind
much
lacing
nose
is
a
large
dose
of
lemon
and
a
lighter
amount
of
spice
taste
is
lemon
light
spice
and
a
bit
of
wheat
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
although
the
spice
takes
over
a
bit
not
too
much
going
on
with
this
and
i
would
prefer
it
without
the
extra
additions
d
not
bad
overall
but
would
not
be
having
this
one
again
in
the
future
this
is
definitely
a
good
brew
it
is
well
balanced
smooth
and
pleasant
it
has
a
very
refreshing
aftertaste
poured
a
pale
yellow
straw
color
smelled
of
lemon
zest
hops
and
orange
peels
with
peppers
tasted
quite
spicy
which
did
not
really
do
anything
for
me
hoppy
and
all
around
kindy
nasty
mouthfeel
was
fairly
average
with
some
crisp
carbonation
to
it
fairly
drinkable
not
a
bad
summer
choice
far
better
than
some
i
have
had
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
effort
from
sam
adams
although
i
do
prefer
their
marzen
and
winter
lager
by
leaps
and
bounds
over
this
one
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
wheat
beers
and
so
i
am
a
little
underwhelmed
by
this
offering
however
i
can
see
the
sa
summer
as
a
legitimate
easygoing
tailgate
beer
for
fans
of
this
style
appearance
is
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
head
that
dissapates
quickly
leaving
no
head
smell
has
a
light
nose
of
sweet
malt
taste
has
an
interesting
light
cream
soda
sweetness
followed
by
a
light
hop
that
has
good
balance
with
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
body
and
carbonation
overall
its
a
easy
going
non
complex
summer
ale
overall
not
the
beer
i
have
wonderful
memories
of
but
thats
probably
not
because
the
recipe
has
changed
i
see
the
changes
more
within
myself
drinks
good
pretty
average
summer
beer
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
one
ive
never
had
a
sam
adams
beer
that
tasted
bad
and
this
summer
ale
keeps
the
record
going
summer
ale
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
head
of
foam
that
has
some
longevity
to
it
definetly
can
taste
the
wheat
in
it
it
has
a
deep
rich
taste
to
it
that
makes
it
not
weak
but
yet
not
to
stong
very
tasty
on
a
warm
summer
day
very
yellow
fizzy
looking
with
a
soft
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
with
no
lacing
the
bubbles
are
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
the
beer
fizzes
like
lemon
lime
soda
there
are
aromas
of
bitter
orange
and
lemon
peel
corriander
spice
and
some
grassy
aromas
flavors
are
similar
to
the
aroma
but
its
got
a
real
astrigent
flavor
that
puckers
the
palate
the
lemon
is
much
more
predominant
this
year
and
the
flavor
profile
has
been
watered
down
from
what
i
can
remember
mouthfeel
is
astrignent
and
light
but
very
refreshing
artificial
sweetness
cloys
and
makes
this
somewhat
hard
to
put
down
after
it
warms
too
much
drink
cold
and
enjoy
edit
after
having
this
prior
to
anything
else
today
as
opposed
to
after
a
few
others
previously
the
true
awfulness
came
through
nearly
couldnt
finish
it
looks
ok
and
tastes
awful
average
body
undrinkable
drinkability
pretty
poor
taste
not
something
id
want
again
for
a
summer
style
beer
this
pours
with
a
surprisingly
opaqueness
quality
very
little
aroma
as
is
expected
with
such
a
light
beer
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
the
finish
has
notes
of
vanilla
and
honey
possibly
the
perfect
beer
to
make
shandies
with
best
enjoyed
on
a
sunny
back
deck
deasy
drinker
and
has
a
quenching
quality
also
making
it
a
good
inexpensive
summer
session
ale
as
far
as
mass
craft
goes
d
a
decent
easy
to
drink
beer
by
sam
adams
not
my
favorite
seasonal
from
them
but
a
decent
beer
to
get
when
out
to
eat
would
never
seek
out
but
will
drink
again
at
some
point
decent
looking
beer
and
was
in
the
mood
for
a
lighter
summer
quaffer
average
head
with
no
lacing
smelled
very
citrusy
but
almost
like
a
cough
drop
tasted
also
like
a
cough
drop
and
not
a
good
one
really
bummed
on
this
one
as
i
continually
want
to
like
sam
adams
and
try
their
offerings
but
i
think
i
am
done
after
this
one
so
many
better
options
for
the
price
its
not
even
close
any
more
a
bummer
and
i
want
my
money
back
surprised
really
that
sa
put
this
into
a
seasonal
if
i
brewed
this
i
would
not
share
it
with
anyone
wow
this
beer
is
a
train
wreck
imo
i
had
to
buy
the
6er
ontario
only
sells
6
12
and
24
unless
otherwise
noted
and
this
thankfully
was
my
last
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
chance
i
wanted
to
like
it
i
havent
had
a
bad
sa
yet
but
my
god
this
was
an
abomination
i
feel
like
i
should
scrub
my
mouth
out
with
a
dirty
toilet
brush
to
get
the
taste
out
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
clear
straw
color
with
a
filmy
white
head
wheaty
aroma
with
a
slight
lemony
tinge
and
an
even
slighter
hint
of
unripe
stone
fruit
flavor
is
grainy
and
wheaty
with
minor
notes
of
peach
pit
and
mineral
water
watery
but
smoother
than
most
crapass
american
wheats
not
quite
crisp
enough
if
im
looking
purely
for
refreshment
libation
i
like
the
beverage
but
it
seems
a
bit
too
muted
and
made
for
the
mass
market
better
than
most
macros
by
far
but
there
are
better
wheat
ales
available
pours
a
nice
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
smells
are
faint
which
for
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
rather
odd
what
i
do
smell
however
are
citrus
smells
of
lemon
and
orange
zest
as
well
as
a
pepper
note
to
follow
the
initial
sip
hits
the
tongue
and
oddly
reminds
of
a
dreamsicle
which
is
pleasant
but
definitely
unexpected
this
is
due
to
the
creaminess
of
the
body
of
the
beer
along
with
the
strong
citrus
flavor
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
realize
how
intense
the
flavors
are
and
there
are
a
lot
of
flavors
in
here
the
wheat
flavor
is
almost
lost
to
it
it
almost
seems
like
im
drinking
a
beer
that
has
had
an
entire
fruit
salad
steeped
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
as
i
previously
stated
it
is
creamy
in
nature
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
for
a
fresh
summery
beer
recommended
if
on
a
budget
during
the
summer
d
a
very
very
good
beer
to
cook
out
with
when
the
thermometer
goes
up
the
tart
spice
enhances
meat
flavors
rather
than
mutes
them
also
great
on
its
own
to
just
sit
in
the
sun
and
relax
not
my
favorite
and
the
last
time
i
will
buy
it
it
is
to
light
and
to
citrusy
it
taste
funny
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
goes
down
easy
and
smooth
decided
on
a
whim
to
have
this
with
lunch
today
god
what
a
mistake
suffice
to
say
there
was
no
lacing
and
it
tasted
like
lemon
grass
and
pepper
i
admire
sam
adams
for
what
they
have
done
for
the
craft
beer
industry
but
lament
them
for
their
lack
of
imagination
with
beers
their
only
truly
good
beers
are
that
bullshit
marketing
imperial
series
that
come
in
over
priced
4
packs
those
are
actually
good
beers
the
rest
of
their
lineup
is
soulless
and
an
embarrassment
to
craft
beer
hazy
yellow
appearance
in
my
pint
glass
with
little
head
but
good
retention
not
much
on
the
nose
but
a
good
lemony
wheat
taste
to
this
one
definitely
one
of
the
more
citrusheavy
wheat
beers
ive
ever
had
and
yet
done
so
tactfullystill
tastes
very
much
like
a
beer
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
some
overly
citrused
wheats
sorta
boring
and
not
overly
impressive
in
any
way
but
it
sure
is
refreshing
a
situational
beer
for
sureperfect
on
the
beach
or
with
the
right
dinner
loved
it
with
my
chicken
dish
not
sure
its
worth
the
hype
that
surrounds
it
in
the
boston
area
but
definitely
one
of
my
most
ordered
dinner
accompaniments
good
stuff
taste
isnt
much
better
than
the
nose
its
also
medicinal
and
all
sorths
of
weird
flavors
im
not
shure
whats
going
on
here
but
it
isnt
good
d
a
pretty
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
not
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
but
it
is
often
the
best
option
in
summer
at
less
beercentric
establishments
this
isnt
a
hard
beer
to
drink
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
sam
adams
is
renowned
for
making
very
approachable
beers
and
the
summer
ale
is
no
different
i
just
wish
there
was
more
character
to
it
than
simply
some
sourness
and
malts
i
think
ill
stick
to
hefeweizens
for
my
wheat
beer
cravings
very
drinkable
good
for
summer
aroma
and
taste
is
nice
has
a
bit
of
sweet
lemon
and
hops
that
combine
nicely
not
too
bitter
highly
drinkable
it
isnt
much
more
filling
than
a
lager
but
has
more
flavor
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
if
you
can
find
it
not
a
bad
seasonal
recommended
notes
the
spices
and
lemon
zest
are
a
little
too
unbalanced
to
me
an
interesting
beer
and
it
does
have
some
refreshing
abilities
for
a
summer
day
it
just
seems
a
little
too
off
balance
to
me
pretty
drinkable
but
the
bitterness
does
build
a
bit
though
unlike
the
somewhat
similar
trashy
blonde
though
you
can
have
a
few
of
these
and
not
have
your
tongue
destroyed
by
bitterness
d
not
my
favourite
sam
adams
i
was
disappointed
i
probably
will
not
buy
this
again
drinking
straight
from
the
bottle
the
first
thing
i
tasted
was
a
chemical
lemon
flavor
upon
finishing
and
stepping
on
my
back
portch
i
smell
citronella
which
smelled
exactly
like
the
lemon
taste
in
this
beer
on
the
bright
side
it
was
smooth
and
not
to
strong
to
be
unbearable
in
a
world
of
great
summer
ales
there
is
no
need
to
try
this
again
tasty
reliable
summer
brew
i
feel
like
i
have
either
liked
this
better
in
years
past
or
have
just
tasted
better
summers
tasty
but
not
refreshing
and
gets
a
little
heavy
after
a
while
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
drinkablecan
drink
this
all
day
and
all
night
very
high
marksmaybe
my
favorite
summer
beer
easy
going
and
sessionable
but
nothing
game
changing
about
it
good
but
ive
had
better
nice
head
almost
three
fingers
with
some
lasting
power
good
lacing
that
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
like
glue
good
and
thick
not
bad
color
for
a
light
ale
a
6
on
the
srm
chart
good
trace
of
wheat
but
not
overpowering
more
of
a
smell
of
wheat
in
the
field
not
the
barn
lots
of
carbonation
that
tingles
the
tongue
as
i
retain
it
in
my
mouth
just
a
little
more
than
i
like
very
little
after
taste
but
what
there
is
is
pleasing
much
better
than
the
other
wheat
ales
i
have
tasted
still
a
little
pricey
i
would
splurge
for
those
who
like
wheat
ale
i
would
not
turn
this
beer
down
if
someone
gave
me
one
i
expect
a
lot
from
sam
adams
with
summer
ale
i
was
not
fully
satisfied
the
original
citrus
taste
is
satisfying
but
i
hate
the
bitter
aftertaste
a
slight
bitterness
is
perfect
among
beers
but
summer
ale
slightly
overdoes
itself
is
it
too
harsh
to
finish
a
six
pack
on
a
hot
day
no
is
it
better
than
a
corona
yes
but
is
it
the
beer
that
i
would
prefer
to
be
drinking
no
taste
was
similar
not
much
desirable
going
on
here
nothing
bad
just
nothing
of
note
the
two
bottles
i
drank
were
very
fizzy
but
light
bodied
not
a
beer
that
made
me
want
to
drink
more
i
had
two
but
only
because
it
was
the
only
beer
available
its
still
highly
drinkable
and
quenches
your
thirst
had
this
over
the
weekend
for
free
at
a
charity
event
and
was
happy
to
drink
3
or
so
glasses
nonetheless
ok
well
ive
seen
most
reviews
out
and
about
giving
this
ale
an
average
of
a
b
this
is
not
acceptable
this
ale
achieves
a
great
complexity
of
taste
and
yet
such
simplicity
in
drinkability
that
i
do
not
understand
why
this
ale
is
rated
a
somewhat
above
average
b
summer
ales
are
meant
to
be
drinkable
but
with
this
much
flavor
wow
where
to
start
ill
opt
to
not
this
is
a
great
ale
enjoy
the
grains
of
paradise
it
poured
a
golden
straw
wheat
yellow
slightly
cloudy
with
barely
any
head
it
smells
of
yeast
citrus
and
coriander
and
smells
pretty
good
it
tastes
of
light
yeast
with
the
citrus
perhaps
orange
peel
coming
through
its
slightly
sweet
and
tastes
pretty
solid
definitely
better
out
of
a
bottle
than
on
tap
the
mouthfeel
is
just
ok
its
very
light
with
just
slight
carbonation
its
extremely
drinkable
being
both
tasty
and
light
its
something
worth
drinking
if
on
funds
are
tight
its
probably
my
favorite
sam
adams
brew
after
the
boston
lager
d
so
much
better
than
the
bottle
i
had
you
can
float
a
cap
on
water
pours
a
cloudy
golden
pale
colour
little
head
no
lacing
present
on
the
glass
smells
strong
of
citrus
and
yeast
that
was
pretty
much
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
aroma
department
for
this
one
lots
of
green
apple
and
bready
sweet
malt
in
this
medium
to
light
in
the
mouth
not
terrible
but
lots
to
be
desired
here
i
could
drink
one
of
these
but
thats
about
it
by
far
not
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
glad
to
have
tried
it
though
overall
good
beer
good
go
to
beer
if
looking
for
a
summer
style
all
in
all
an
above
average
pale
wheat
nothing
more
pours
an
extremely
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
citrus
fruits
meat
smokiness
and
spices
the
taste
is
initially
full
of
flavor
lots
of
meat
and
spices
very
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
awesome
and
the
drinkability
is
high
d
good
easy
light
tasting
good
drinker
d
solid
summer
beer
very
crisp
and
refreshing
could
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
afternoon
rather
aggressive
pour
into
a
hefeweizen
glass
for
nice
threefinger
head
with
heavy
lacing
remaining
and
a
translucent
golden
body
the
classical
image
of
beer
not
as
textured
or
wheaty
as
ontap
but
still
refreshing
very
light
citrus
notes
not
bitter
at
all
taste
primarily
of
cereal
grains
is
subdued
for
good
sessionability
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
unassuming
and
straightforward
fans
of
german
lager
and
wheat
beers
will
appreciate
this
domestic
standby
though
its
priced
appropriately
as
a
quality
beer
mb
despite
boston
beer
companys
refusal
to
can
any
of
their
beers
this
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
such
portability
take
this
one
outside
and
pour
into
a
glass
d
its
refreshing
and
its
light
ill
give
it
that
goes
real
well
with
sandwiches
and
warm
days
summer
is
always
better
with
samuel
adams
summer
ale
the
beer
poured
a
very
nice
pale
gold
color
with
a
2
white
head
that
quickly
lay
down
to
a
thin
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
it
has
a
light
aroma
of
lemon
and
wheat
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
little
hint
of
lemon
followed
by
wheat
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
and
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonal
d
fantastic
summer
drink
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
with
enough
interesting
flavours
to
keep
my
attention
d
i
can
see
the
carbonation
holding
the
drinkability
back
a
bit
but
this
is
really
refreshing
for
a
summer
day
the
lemon
zest
is
a
nice
touch
for
a
summer
ale
i
enjoyed
this
beer
served
on
draft
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
not
a
sam

the

someone
really
reading
this
straw
gold
with
a
thin
poorly
retained
head
no
lace
soapy
lemon
aroma
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
its
pleasant
lemon
flavour
is
marred
by
that
same
soapy
character
in
its
aroma
mild
unpleasant
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
tylenol
light
spritzy
and
quenching
the
fact
it
tastes
like
its
meant
for
washing
away
sweat
and
dirt
instead
of
washing
down
a
meal
detracts
from
its
drinkability
very
drinkable
an
awesome
summer
quencher
here
a
simple
wheat
ale
nothing
particularly
remarkable
despite
the
pseudoexotic
guest
spice
ingredient
however
given
my
predicament
right
now
this
came
off
as
pretty
thirst
quenching
and
a
worthy
kickoff
to
wandering
back
out
into
the
pavementenhanced
sunshine
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
has
some
good
substance
to
it
drinkability
is
good
refreshing
no
overpowering
tastes
a
solid
warm
weather
staple
d
ive
had
this
one
in
the
past
and
remember
it
being
a
lot
better
this
one
was
pulled
out
of
the
summer
selection
the
draft
version
is
better
looks
good
and
has
a
summer
appearance
label
on
the
bottle
smells
of
lemon
and
spices
has
little
head
taste
is
above
average
but
not
the
best
the
lemony
flavor
makes
this
beer
taste
great
so
mouthful
has
the
same
rating
as
taste
drinkability
is
excellent
not
the
best
but
very
close
this
is
a
beer
one
could
drink
all
day
goes
down
smooth
and
refreshing
pretty
drinkable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
pretty
much
middle
of
the
road
for
a
summertime
beer
smells
somewhat
wheaty
with
a
little
lemon
in
there
and
some
odd
spices
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
taste
is
not
for
me
i
usually
like
summers
but
this
is
a
little
heavier
and
definitely
has
a
heavy
lemon
tinge
eh
im
not
a
huge
wheat
fan
but
found
this
one
pretty
drinkable
even
with
its
large
lemony
flavor
as
my
sam
adams
key
chain
bottle
opener
would
annotate
i
am
a
fan
of
the
boston
beer
company
but
that
being
said
this
beer
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
by
them
clear
gold
with
a
fine
cap
of
white
foam
good
head
retention
a
bit
of
sticky
lace
mostly
sheets
the
initial
aroma
after
the
pour
was
very
nice
but
it
lost
some
of
its
punch
fairly
quick
nice
orange
blossom
and
spice
up
front
fading
to
a
crackery
malt
aroma
more
orange
and
lemon
citrus
in
the
flavour
light
bitterness
faint
spiciness
with
sort
of
a
soapy
character
light
bodied
with
some
dryness
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
crisp
pretty
refreshing
and
nicely
balanced
i
am
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
i
have
always
enjoyed
sam
adams
lagers
but
this
one
did
not
meet
my
standards
to
their
other
beers
overall
the
scent
was
more
like
a
clean
pils
with
lots
of
citrus
and
zip
the
flavor
is
definitely
that
of
a
soft
wheat
ale
that
bathes
the
tongue
is
down
featherlike
softness
it
all
balances
out
into
a
nonintrusive
pleasant
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
summer
beer
a
little
bland
so
its
more
of
a
quencher
than
a
ponderer
ill
order
it
on
tap
on
hot
nights
at
pedestriantype
restaurants
when
i
see
this
summer
cloudy
golden
color
with
some
orange
hues
small
head
even
with
a
hard
pour
smells
interesting
with
the
spices
and
a
healthy
dose
of
lemon
tastes
decent
but
is
a
little
over
spiced
for
my
liking
mild
wheat
flavor
and
lemon
zest
add
a
somewhat
refreshing
aspect
fluid
mouthfeel
with
ample
carbonation
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
but
the
dominate
flavors
wear
on
the
palate
after
a
few
standard
pale
wheat
beer
look
with
substandard
head
and
lacing
no
torrified
wheat
smell
nicely
peppery
and
citrusy
but
disturbingly
chemical
and
soapy
taste
is
clementines
and
bleachy
solvents
almost
unspeakable
i
sincerely
hope
there
is
merely
something
wrong
with
the
glass
than
with
the
beer
but
a
quick
chat
with
the
bartender
who
has
overseen
innummeable
kegs
of
this
stuff
pass
through
the
draught
line
in
the
last
two
months
and
another
sample
confirms
my
worst
suspicions
african
spices
be
damned
hideous
d
drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
but
the
faint
sour
aftertaste
would
prevent
me
from
having
too
many
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
especially
easy
to
drink
and
perfect
for
summer
who
woulda
thought
samuel
adams
summer
ale
is
a
very
decent
beer
for
the
summer
season
this
beer
has
a
nice
yellowish
tint
to
it
good
head
the
smell
definitely
can
make
you
think
of
summer
it
is
easy
to
smell
the
citrusy
flavors
the
taste
is
good
in
this
beer
good
flavor
with
the
citrus
and
wheat
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
taste
that
may
turn
some
off
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
but
a
good
one
drinkability
a
summer
thirst
quencher
if
there
ever
was
one
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
beauty
no
worries
the
perfect
cure
for
a
summer
heat
wave
bought
a
case
the
other
week
pours
a
hazy
copper
yellow
nice
white
head
that
lingers
slightly
smells
of
wheat
and
a
lemon
citrus
character
hops
are
evident
but
tucked
away
in
the
background
tastes
of
the
same
vein
in
that
lemon
wheat
dominate
does
have
a
slight
puckering
but
the
carbonation
gently
displays
the
flavors
this
one
is
an
extremely
drinkable
ale
in
the
prime
of
summer
not
sure
how
it
would
hold
up
in
other
months
but
its
a
really
good
bbq
brew
the
ale
arrived
a
cloudy
goldenyellow
color
with
a
small
whitehead
spicy
aroma
with
some
sweet
malt
not
much
more
the
flavor
was
refreshing
and
slightly
sharp
on
the
tongue
due
to
the
additional
spices
and
orange
added
the
taste
ended
with
a
husky
wheat
flavor
the
carbonation
was
adequate
and
the
body
was
light
but
flavorful
it
would
be
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
during
the
hot
and
humid
summer
months
d
simple
refreshing
beer
good
for
summertime
drinking
this
beer
paired
well
with
the
blue
crabs
i
was
feasting
on
and
i
would
probably
get
it
again
drink
the
off
spiciness
just
gets
worse
as
i
work
down
the
glass
although
this
beer
lacks
that
clean
crisp
bite
one
might
expect
i
did
find
it
fairly
drinkable
this
is
a
good
little
wheat
ale
to
throw
back
on
a
summer
night
while
enjoying
a
pizza
way
too
much
lemon
flavoring
i
dont
think
this
could
be
real
lemon
unless
they
put
1
lemon
per
12
ounces
in
the
lemon
hides
any
flavor
of
the
beer
you
can
catch
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
but
i
think
they
need
to
dial
the
lemon
back
a
lot
maybe
i
am
being
too
harsh
but
that
is
what
i
am
tasting
at
this
moment
i
will
come
back
for
a
rereview
if
i
feel
differently
at
another
time
but
right
now
i
am
not
feeling
this
beer
good
beer
for
parties
and
cookouts
though
because
alot
of
people
like
it
along
the
lines
of
bud
light
its
good
definitely
way
better
than
the
bottled
version
or
theyve
improved
from
previous
years
i
typically
like
sam
adams
product
and
ive
enjoyed
this
one
in
the
past
butand
maybe
this
is
just
the
particular
bottle
i
had
this
time
aroundi
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
the
summer
ale
i
shouldnt
say
avoid
and
you
probably
shouldnt
listen
to
me
anyway
but
if
i
were
you
reach
for
a
different
sa
than
their
summer
ale
sam
summer
arrives
at
my
table
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
bright
white
lacy
head
very
attractive
and
refreshing
looking
the
aroma
is
crisp
and
clean
with
some
sweet
wheat
malt
and
a
bit
of
graininess
as
well
as
some
sour
citrus
bite
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
a
very
grainy
malt
base
that
also
carries
some
wheat
notes
citrus
zest
and
some
spicy
pepperyness
are
also
present
but
everything
is
pretty
subdued
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
has
a
nice
smoothness
to
it
and
a
clean
finish
not
overly
carbonated
and
very
refreshing
this
beer
goes
down
easily
a
decent
summer
beer
to
be
sure
but
i
find
it
lacking
a
bit
in
the
flavor
department
there
are
definitely
better
american
wheat
beers
to
be
had
but
none
are
as
widely
available
as
this
one
thumbs
down
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
mild
case
of
the
bubbles
a
good
summer
brew
that
is
easy
drinking
mild
on
the
brain
and
pretty
refreshing
d
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
as
well
as
a
good
beginner
beer
true
to
style
but
not
great
i
would
like
a
little
more
hop
or
yeast
character
i
would
have
no
problem
pulling
one
of
these
out
of
the
cooler
at
a
picnic
but
i
would
not
search
one
out
md
pretty
easy
to
drink
good
beer
drinkable
of
course
cheers
d
perfect
summer
drink
nothing
that
will
completely
blown
your
mind
with
respect
to
flavour
but
it
does
offer
the
unique
flavours
from
the
grains
of
paradise
and
the
lemon
makes
it
incredibly
refreshing
easily
sessionable
and
perfect
for
chillin
on
your
patio
in
the
sun
golden
slightly
hazy
with
the
typical
esteresque
aroma
found
in
wheat
beers
no
head
hard
to
descrbe
slightly
grainy
front
middle
and
finish
medium
mouthfeel
very
light
hopping
with
a
crispcitrusy
middle
a
passable
version
of
a
light
summer
beer
a
good
lawn
mower
beer
but
not
much
more
yellow
hue
clear
close
up
but
cloudy
at
a
distance
light
lemony
aroma
with
a
decent
head
and
strong
carbonation
there
is
a
clear
second
flavor
above
and
beyond
the
classic
wheat
beer
taste
if
you
can
get
through
the
idiosyncratic
taste
youll
enjoy
another
good
as
a
summer
quencher
but
not
really
interesting
enough
to
be
sessionable
all
told
this
definitely
isnt
my
favorite
in
the
variety
pack
it
definitely
sits
above
the
light
lager
though
it
just
about
ties
their
regular
lager
it
is
ok
for
a
summer
beer
although
i
think
that
the
chalkycreamy
aspect
to
its
taste
really
detracts
from
its
draw
as
a
refreshing
beer
of
the
summer
light
body
and
a
crisp
mouthfeel
pretty
nicely
balanced
beer
just
a
bit
sweet
and
just
a
bit
bitter
i
found
this
beer
a
bit
disappointing
i
remember
past
years
being
a
little
better
than
this
one
overall
i
would
rate
it
less
drinkable
than
many
other
summer
seasonals
ive
tried
this
year
bottom
line
good
not
great
nothing
here
that
will
draw
me
to
drink
this
one
anytime
soon
unless
it
is
screaming
hot
and
there
is
no
other
good
choices
it
is
what
it
is
but
it
is
kind
of
disappointing
for
a
seasonal
good
baby
step
or
training
wheel
beer
but
nothing
more
so
all
in
all
dont
turn
it
down
but
if
you
have
other
options
lean
that
way
i
dont
know
if
my
tastes
have
changed
or
the
beer
has
but
i
seem
to
remember
the
last
time
i
tried
this
being
more
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
grains
of
paradise
and
other
spices
this
time
around
it
seems
very
subdued
and
more
lemony
too
bad
i
wanted
the
latitude
48
so
i
had
to
get
the
whole
summer
styles
box
oh
well
i
guess
ill
suck
it
up
and
drink
the
extraneous
bottles
tee
hee
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
and
a
very
light
bit
o
wheat
uncomplicated
yet
still
pretty
nice
the
taste
holds
quite
a
bit
of
cardamom
along
with
a
bit
o
coriander
and
some
light
grains
too
much
spicy
flavors
not
enough
of
the
grains
something
like
that
the
body
is
light
with
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
overall
a
decent
lemonadestyle
brew
but
nothing
great
d
very
drinkable
especially
on
the
aforementioned
hot
summer
day
but
not
something
im
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
this
sort
of
beer
isnt
going
to
push
any
new
ground
but
its
a
solid
wellmade
beer
that
definitely
quenches
your
thirst
all
in
all
a
fairly
decent
take
on
the
style
i
wouldnt
turn
it
away
if
i
was
offered
another
not
exactly
worth
seeking
out
but
definitely
worth
a
try
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
goes
great
after
a
hot
day
not
a
great
or
overly
impressive
beer
but
a
decent
brew
especially
on
hot
days
final
notes
a
nice
refreshing
brew
on
a
hot
day
great
for
parties
and
backyard
barbecues
pours
a
hazy
bright
yellow
like
the
sun
piercing
a
fog
has
a
nice
white
head
that
settles
to
collar
aromas
of
wheat
and
lemon
zest
taste
is
big
on
the
malts
light
on
the
yeastiness
and
balanced
by
a
lemon
bitterness
finishes
sweet
a
very
enjoyable
summer
brew
d
enjoyable
and
flavorful
a
little
too
sweet
to
really
throw
them
back
overall
i
like
it
similar
to
a
yuengling
to
be
honest
i
am
fond
of
these
lighter
ales
so
this
is
one
that
i
will
deffinately
pick
up
again
i
recommend
for
a
sunny
day
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
it
is
drinkable
i
didnt
order
a
second
one
though
d
drinkable
enough
for
a
hot
summer
day
to
cool
off
served
from
bottle
into
samuel
smith
imperial
pint
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
one
finger
white
head
that
subsides
to
minimal
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
present
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
citrus
and
wheat
the
flavor
was
of
wheat
with
a
lemon
followthrough
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
brew
not
great
however
it
was
nicely
drinkable
as
a
lawnmower
brew
but
it
needs
more
flavor
and
aroma
to
be
great
had
this
beer
years
ago
when
it
available
in
bc
liqour
stores
but
the
one
i
picked
up
in
oak
harbour
was
fresher
and
full
of
citrus
notes
than
the
ones
i
remember
nice
combination
of
a
golden
ale
wheat
beer
and
saison
in
a
sessionable
12
oz
bottle
i
wish
we
could
get
this
in
bc
again
as
i
would
keep
a
sixer
in
the
fridge
for
those
hot
day
and
warma
nights
to
come
beer
was
fairly
drinkable
but
there
are
better
sam
adams
brews
for
me
this
beer
didnt
really
seem
too
summery
or
lemony
and
i
can
think
of
better
things
to
drink
in
the
heat
however
it
is
better
than
adjucts
and
their
partners
like
shock
top
and
blue
moon
and
certainly
better
than
other
sam
adams
wheat
beers
a
decent
seasonal
from
sam
adams
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
ill
always
end
up
having
at
least
a
few
of
these
every
summer
eta2
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
some
its
pretty
decent
and
i
do
wind
up
buying
a
sixer
of
it
every
now
and
then
i
like
the
body
most
of
all
along
with
the
flavor
which
is
quite
tasty
drinkability
it
was
a
little
too
far
on
the
creamy
side
for
me
so
i
gave
it
just
an
average
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
also
not
one
i
would
likely
go
back
for
again
sam
adams
hit
it
out
of
the
park
with
their
noble
pils
their
spring
seasonal
beer
this
wheat
the
summer
seasonal
is
just
average
a
decent
beer
for
a
summer
picnic
or
whatever
but
uncle
sam
really
should
just
distribute
their
noble
pils
over
the
summer
its
so
superior
to
this
brew
high
carbonation
but
not
at
all
refreshing
ive
decided
to
try
this
beer
again
in
the
future
to
rule
out
that
my
beer
was
somehow
adulterated
as
i
expected
better
from
samuel
adams
dthis
is
a
knock
em
back
summer
brew
nothing
amazing
nothing
special
just
a
decent
solid
summer
thirst
quencher
for
a
session
by
the
pool
id
be
pretty
bored
after
a
few
of
these
but
this
may
just
be
the
ticket
for
a
bbq
beer
that
might
have
widespread
appeal
a
little
simpleminded
in
all
the
lemon
character
partly
reminding
more
of
lemon
soda
than
beer
sam
adams
knows
what
theyre
doing
but
that
doesnt
give
them
an
automatic
a
the
color
was
a
nice
summer
ale
yellow
with
a
noticeable
citrus
flavor
overall
i
described
it
somewhere
between
decent
and
okay
it
was
my
first
beer
of
the
night
and
i
decided
to
try
other
things
afterward
poured
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
smells
like
malt
and
lemon
with
a
touch
of
hops
tastes
about
the
same
lemon
and
malt
and
hops
carbonation
is
about
right
these
are
nice
in
the
evening
after
a
long
walk
nothing
spectacular
but
a
good
solid
beer
d
this
was
a
decent
light
summer
beer
that
was
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
recommended
the
hops
dominate
but
dont
add
the
best
flavor
and
the
body
is
too
fizzy
for
my
taste
im
not
trusting
an
airport
to
serve
a
pint
in
good
condition
nevertheless
this
one
came
out
thin
and
sour
like
a
bad
summer
lightning
with
no
sign
of
the
spice
sam
summer
ale
is
an
easy
drinking
no
frills
kinda
beer
that
appeals
to
the
masses
i
find
this
beer
to
be
really
non
offensive
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
interest
in
it
at
all
with
that
said
ill
be
reaching
for
something
else
this
summer
d
very
drinkable
for
the
summer
months
of
the
year
not
a
whole
lot
can
beat
sitting
on
the
deck
bsing
with
the
boys
and
having
a
12
pack
of
this
by
your
side
if
youre
just
going
to
be
alone
though
meh
when
i
had
this
before
i
distinctly
remember
the
character
of
the
grains
of
paradise
being
totally
dominating
in
both
the
flavor
and
aroma
the
lemon
character
was
slim
to
none
but
it
was
there
i
dont
know
if
that
was
from
a
previous
recipe
or
maybe
that
has
to
do
with
the
freshness
regardless
it
was
an
interesting
example
of
the
style
overall
an
ok
beer
to
be
had
very
drinkable
but
there
are
better
wheat
ales
witbiers
out
there
d
allinall
not
bad
very
refreshing
the
lemon
can
be
overwhelming
after
a
bit
especially
with
nothing
besides
wheaty
sweetness
to
balance
it
over
all
this
is
a
very
nice
round
summer
beer
to
be
enjoyed
outdoors
maybe
even
with
a
little
grilling
going
on
d
there
are
some
nice
elements
in
there
but
it
doesnt
come
together
as
a
drinkable
whole
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
one
i
had
but
i
couldnt
see
reaching
for
another
drinkability
ive
had
this
before
this
year
about
a
month
ago
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
so
i
also
wonder
if
the
flavor
gets
lost
as
it
warms
up
and
ages
from
its
original
brew
date
went
okay
with
a
burger
and
fries
but
in
the
summer
with
a
beer
that
will
warm
up
fast
i
think
the
flavor
should
be
more
balanced
through
a
wider
temperature
range
sure
you
could
chug
it
cold
but
then
what
is
there
to
enjoy
taste
wise
i
cant
see
myself
getting
this
again
after
having
it
again
from
another
batch
best
by
112010
its
not
getting
any
better
and
i
think
i
like
it
even
less
it
does
not
age
well
this
beer
really
built
me
up
with
its
looks
and
smell
but
could
not
really
deliver
on
what
counts
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
love
lemons
so
i
loved
the
lemony
flavor
great
for
a
hot
day
light
beer
good
to
drink
on
a
hot
night
drinkability
i
like
it
compared
to
the
other
summer
ales
i
have
had
a
good
beer
to
bring
to
the
lake
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
i
liked
what
the
beer
put
on
the
table
i
just
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
oomph
behind
it
in
certain
spots
still
another
tasty
one
from
sam
adams
if
i
see
it
on
tap
again
at
local
restaurants
ill
probably
go
for
it
again
still
beats
the
hell
out
of
most
things
they
offer
on
draft
at
big
chain
restaurants
d
this
is
definitely
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
threw
back
4
of
these
and
did
not
feel
weighted
down
at
all
that
being
said
it
didt
particularly
strike
me
as
memorable
a
good
safe
beer
widely
available
on
tap
when
youre
out
and
want
something
light
and
inoffensive
a
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
day
for
sure
doesnt
bring
anything
new
or
exciting
to
the
table
but
then
thats
not
the
point
is
it
texture
this
is
where
it
got
me
drinking
a
swig
of
this
summer
ale
is
like
drinking
beer
flavored
heavy
cream
its
very
thick
on
the
tongue
and
seems
cohesive
when
you
swallow
very
strange
edit
after
reading
the
bros
review
in
this
months
ba
id
argue
that
this
beer
is
misclassified
the
above
review
based
on
the
apwa
category
given
the
belgian
take
on
this
hybrid
style
the
taste
profile
makes
sense
but
ill
still
pass
next
time
d
i
cant
say
im
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
seems
like
its
trying
to
be
a
lighter
version
of
their
winter
lager
but
it
lacks
the
great
spicy
flavor
and
crisp
finish
that
i
love
from
the
winter
lager
the
soapy
flavor
that
i
tasted
turns
me
off
and
i
think
there
are
many
more
attractive
options
for
a
refreshing
summer
session
beer
md
lighter
body
lots
of
zippy
carbonation
bubbles
very
average
drinkability
is
okay
if
it
was
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
this
would
be
better
but
i
had
this
at
night
on
a
rooftop
deck
d
the
beer
is
drinkable
no
doubt
about
it
the
hype
on
the
brew
overall
is
not
for
me
you
can
put
these
down
no
problem
i
just
think
there
are
some
other
seasonals
out
there
that
embrace
the
season
paleyellow
liquid
poured
into
sa
glass
retains
thin
white
foam
head
all
citrus
orange
and
lemon
aromas
carbonated
tingle
and
medium
body
gives
way
to
pleasant
wheat
and
orange
aftertaste
smooth
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
while
tending
the
grill
can
certainly
tip
back
a
few
and
have
room
for
the
ribs
d
alright
drinkability
not
the
best
summer
ale
out
there
but
then
again
this
is
the
one
most
places
have
on
tap
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
bbc
but
i
feel
its
made
for
more
of
the
bmc
crowd
d
this
is
a
nice
summer
ale
very
refreshing
but
the
tang
and
citrus
is
a
little
bit
too
strong
to
make
it
a
session
beer
t
it
has
a
wet
citrus
flavor
the
lemon
is
still
the
main
event
on
this
one
a
little
subdued
from
the
aroma
this
makes
me
think
of
great
beer
to
have
after
mowing
the
lawn
in
90
degree
heat
i
once
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
after
sitting
down
and
reviewing
it
there
isnt
too
much
to
it
slainte
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
if
your
taste
buds
were
blasted
by
chile
peppers
or
something
like
ruination
after
extreme
palate
fatigue
this
might
be
pretty
good
drinkability
fairly
easy
but
with
so
many
better
choices
out
there
i
would
steer
clear
i
am
glad
to
see
that
this
is
back
on
the
shelves
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
type
beers
or
beers
with
fruit
or
spices
added
but
for
some
reason
this
stuff
works
for
me
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
almost
dirty
looking
golden
amber
not
much
to
look
at
smell
is
fruity
and
grainy
grainy
wheat
up
front
with
a
little
clove
some
spicy
pepper
flavors
bitter
hop
flavors
are
there
but
way
in
the
background
a
sharp
very
noticable
smack
of
lemon
in
the
finish
i
think
this
is
what
pulls
it
all
together
and
makes
it
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
what
can
i
say
based
on
other
beers
that
are
similar
i
shouldnt
like
this
but
i
do
maybe
im
just
glad
its
almost
memorial
day
pours
a
nice
pale
gold
color
with
some
frothy
white
head
scent
is
of
musty
wheat
with
hints
of
citrus
and
spice
the
taste
is
much
fresher
than
the
scent
with
a
nice
clean
lemon
taste
and
spice
to
it
all
backed
by
a
clean
pale
wheat
charachter
medium
bodied
some
grainyness
to
it
a
nice
refreshing
summer
brew
the
grains
of
paradise
give
it
just
enough
uniqueness
and
charachter
carbonation
is
acceptable
but
id
prefer
a
bit
more
the
body
is
a
tad
heavy
for
me
to
really
consider
this
refreshing
summer
beer
it
isnt
bad
but
ill
stick
with
oberon
d
its
pretty
refreshing
initially
the
added
zest
and
spice
kind
of
overwhelm
the
flavor
while
it
doesnt
seem
artificial
its
just
a
bit
too
much
it
might
be
an
easier
drinker
when
served
at
very
cold
temperatures
mine
wasnt
ice
cold
to
begin
with
id
definitely
drink
it
during
the
summer
months
when
a
tap
list
is
kind
of
on
the
short
side
but
im
not
going
to
seek
it
out
well
its
citrussy
and
it
goes
down
remarkably
quickly
so
chock
this
one
up
as
a
decent
summer
thirst
quencher
though
in
typical
ontario
fashion
its
quite
pricy
over
13
for
the
sixpack
still
itll
work
for
the
weekend
ahead
drinkability
this
would
be
of
course
easily
drinkable
during
the
hot
days
of
summer
i
just
couldnt
get
over
the
smell
sort
of
yellowish
with
a
fluffy
white
head
taste
is
intensely
of
wheat
with
a
bit
of
a
honey
finish
smell
is
kind
of
fragrant
of
spices
behind
the
smell
of
the
wheat
and
hops
kind
of
light
bodied
and
crisp
for
the
summer
months
light
enough
to
drink
2
or
more
the
introduction
of
spice
is
interesting
fairly
thirst
quenching
and
smooth
overall
though
it
is
just
a
fairly
average
beer
still
a
decent
choice
when
in
the
sun
d
for
something
im
assuming
should
be
sessionable
this
is
not
it
tastes
too
bad
with
its
overly
lemoned
flavoring
and
skunkness
cheers
very
easy
drinking
refreshing
summer
brew
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
it
is
a
summer
ale
but
not
my
favorite
style
i
dont
buy
this
very
often
but
i
always
really
like
it
when
i
do
another
solid
sam
adams
offering
d
there
are
a
lot
of
bad
beers
in
the
style
but
this
one
is
really
horrid
d
do
you
like
drinking
urine
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
quench
your
thirst
after
mowing
the
lawn
d
a
real
easy
drinking
beer
that
does
work
quite
well
for
the
warm
weather
i
wouldnt
mind
having
one
of
these
on
a
hot
day
outside
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
can
think
of
better
for
the
style
and
price
range
d
i
wouldnt
go
in
search
of
this
on
a
nice
summer
day
but
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
it
either
d
didnt
have
that
crisp
refreshing
feel
i
was
expecting
from
a
summer
ale
left
me
wanting
similar
to
the
coastal
wheat
ale
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
from
sa
i
tend
to
like
their
seasonal
brews
and
i
was
able
to
appreciate
this
one
too
theres
a
reason
they
brew
this
one
during
the
summer
it
pairs
well
with
a
hot
summer
night
this
was
also
the
first
beer
i
had
on
my
21st
birthday
so
it
will
be
remembered
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
even
now
that
summer
is
relatively
close
notes
a
fairly
nondescript
american
wheat
ale
you
can
definitely
do
worse
but
theres
much
better
wheat
beers
out
there
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
i
remember
that
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
more
this
year
than
i
did
last
my
tastes
and
knowledge
for
beer
have
grown
exponentially
since
then
in
the
end
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
but
i
will
totally
be
drinking
most
of
jimmy
vs
stock
m
not
as
carbonated
as
other
beers
of
this
style
which
i
like
medium
body
seems
a
little
heavy
for
drinking
outside
on
a
hot
and
humid
day
in
arkansas
finishes
crisp
and
dry
d
its
not
bad
and
would
make
a
decent
summerdrinker
but
its
not
my
favorite
sa
beer
not
by
a
long
shot
d
high
marks
for
drinkability
i
like
the
choice
of
spices
in
this
i
like
the
dry
citrus
zest
finish
but
its
watery
complexion
is
a
bit
off
putting
still
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
its
light
character
makes
it
a
little
too
easy
to
put
back
i
already
want
another
one
d
this
is
something
i
can
see
myself
drinking
outside
in
the
summer
quite
often
i
dont
find
this
beer
particularly
refreshing
the
beer
had
high
carbonation
but
a
very
wet
mouthfeel
sorry
but
ive
had
much
better
examples
of
this
style
smells
of
lemon
light
grain
and
that
white
peppery
citrus
grains
of
paradise
smell
good
stuff
taste
is
similarly
lemon
citrus
with
light
grain
crisp
and
ridiculously
refreshing
the
hotter
the
day
the
better
this
beer
is
today
it
was
pretty
good
i
can
tell
you
with
certainty
that
samuel
adams
summer
ale
or
sam
summer
is
very
popular
in
boston
especially
amongst
my
medford
friends
it
is
certainly
a
good
looking
beer
hazy
gold
in
color
with
a
large
pillow
like
white
head
citrus
and
wheat
are
what
i
am
getting
mainly
from
the
nose
very
bright
in
places
the
grains
of
paradise
add
a
nice
element
overall
taste
is
not
quite
as
impressive
with
a
lot
of
that
wheat
and
fruit
flavor
getting
lost
in
the
carbonation
that
being
said
the
finish
is
really
pleasing
very
well
rounded
and
showcasing
the
sweetness
of
the
wheat
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
perfect
for
a
hot
day
like
today
putting
back
a
few
of
these
has
never
been
a
problem
for
me
especially
in
a
barbecue
setting
in
the
past
i
have
dumped
on
this
beer
a
bit
but
right
now
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
enjoying
it
a
lot
it
begs
for
a
good
food
pairing
burgers
sound
perfect
i
would
not
call
this
one
of
my
top
beers
of
choice
just
because
of
my
preferences
but
still
a
good
drink
drinkability
is
very
high
here
these
go
down
very
smooth
and
easy
great
summer
brew
consider
this
a
positive
review
dreally
easy
drinking
with
some
nice
things
going
on
i
dont
know
that
i
would
buy
a
sixer
or
a
12
pack
of
it
but
if
someone
handed
me
one
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
d
another
easy
very
drinkable
would
also
be
good
to
steam
some
shrimp
in
maybe
pours
a
pale
foggy
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
lasts
for
a
little
while
but
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
is
strong
with
a
combination
of
grain
and
lemon
zest
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
reminds
me
a
little
of
sam
adams
light
the
taste
is
very
light
it
has
a
strong
grainy
presence
with
a
lot
of
lemon
and
a
very
tangy
feel
to
it
the
tanginess
remindes
me
of
dogfish
head
festina
peche
pretty
flavorful
for
how
light
it
is
but
it
still
has
too
much
of
a
grainy
taste
to
it
that
i
dont
like
pretty
refreshing
but
overall
an
average
beer
personally
buying
a
single
of
samuel
adams
summer
ale
to
try
it
out
is
fine
i
paid
about
1
67
but
i
m
not
going
near
a
case
drinkability
this
is
really
a
poor
melange
of
flavor
i
think
it
was
brewed
with
the
intention
of
adding
some
complexity
to
the
pale
wheat
ale
category
but
it
just
did
not
end
up
well
the
soapiness
was
particularly
offputting
and
the
full
body
causes
it
to
drag
overall
attractive
crisp
and
refreshing
summer
beer
the
overall
flavor
mixture
could
use
some
work
though
major
disappointment
from
whats
usually
a
fantastic
brewer
drinkability
for
a
summer
time
beer
and
easy
drinking
this
beer
fits
the
bill
quite
nicely
i
could
see
having
a
second
and
id
certainly
not
turn
down
one
in
the
future
if
offered
it
certainly
was
a
reasonable
choice
to
accompany
the
dinner
salad
i
was
having
one
other
nice
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
my
wife
who
isnt
a
big
fan
of
beer
enjoyed
a
few
sips
as
well
pours
a
foggy
golden
yellow
creamy
white
head
patches
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
in
clumps
smell
is
perfumy
it
almost
seems
like
lemons
and
plums
are
duking
it
out
to
see
who
is
dominant
first
taste
was
surprisingly
sour
with
a
strange
carbonated
wallop
of
grapefruit
at
the
end
the
wheat
doesnt
have
near
enough
body
to
support
the
other
flavors
astringent
finish
not
good
at
all
i
am
disappointed
because
i
really
enjoyed
this
release
a
few
years
ago
now
it
doesnt
even
taste
like
the
same
beer
odd
because
this
happened
to
me
with
sas
winter
lager
as
well
definitely
drinkable
i
bought
a
twelvepack
because
it
went
so
well
with
my
chicken
and
pasta
i
like
what
sam
adams
is
trying
to
do
here
sam
adams
is
getting
so
big
however
that
there
seems
to
be
an
unwarranted
bias
against
their
offerings
this
is
a
good
beer
different
and
not
overdone
tastewheat
lots
of
lemon
zest
peppery
spiciness
first
few
gulps
were
refreshing
and
tangy
but
overall
taste
became
increasingly
infused
with
lemon
leaving
a
bitter
lemonrind
aftertaste
a
bit
too
unbalanced
to
make
a
good
summer
session
beer
definitely
drinkable
i
would
choose
other
wheat
ales
over
this
one
but
hey
it
was
free
due
to
me
and
my
teammates
badass
drinking
game
ownage
go
team
rock
wall
dgreat
drinkability
not
to
heavy
clean
taste
good
for
those
warm
summer
days
dmore
than
drinkable
this
beer
was
made
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
by
a
pool
or
with
yard
work
had
on
tap
and
was
a
slight
hazy
yellow
wheat
color
the
smell
was
lemon
and
wet
bread
some
pepper
and
citrus
the
taste
was
worse
it
was
a
lemon
zinger
with
pepperbread
aftertaste
that
was
just
not
good
the
mouth
fell
was
mediumthin
not
real
drinkable
not
one
ill
have
again
this
summer
usually
impressed
with
the
sam
but
not
with
this
beer
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
ever
again
feeldrink
medium
bodied
highly
carbonated
drinkability
is
great
if
you
enjoy
the
flavor
pleasant
approachable
wheat
ale
good
for
sessioning
cheers
taste
is
lightly
citrus
with
a
light
body
but
i
find
it
a
really
enjoyable
drink
particularly
for
the
style
its
well
balanced
not
overly
flavorful
or
hop
but
has
subtle
elements
overall
it
just
has
a
summer
feel
to
it
which
makes
it
ideally
suited
for
the
season
and
for
its
primary
use
dhigh
marks
in
this
area
this
beer
was
made
for
hot
summer
days
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
ive
lost
count
of
how
many
places
i
drank
this
beer
at
last
summer
but
please
keep
your
orange
wedge
and
frosted
glass
this
brew
is
better
without
them
dthere
are
just
so
damn
many
beers
like
this
and
theres
nothing
to
raise
this
one
into
the
75th
percentile
the
lemons
a
nice
touch
but
if
i
wanted
another
beer
like
this
i
would
get
some
leinies
or
something
and
use
the
buck
i
saved
to
buy
an
actual
lemon
more
vitamin
c
that
way
d
a
very
ready
beer
that
is
pretty
drinkable
especially
on
those
hot
summer
nights
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
very
light
and
refreshing
beer
that
pairs
really
well
with
a
lemon
on
a
hot
day
to
add
some
tang
great
summer
beer
to
just
sit
and
enjoy
poured
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
very
cloudy
yellowstraw
color
with
1
finger
white
sudsy
head
the
smell
is
mild
wheat
lemon
yeast
the
taste
matches
the
smell
a
strong
wheat
flavor
with
a
bit
of
citrus
the
bitter
wheat
slightly
sour
lemon
ends
with
a
touch
of
spice
its
a
pretty
good
summer
ale
but
feels
a
little
heavy
after
a
while
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
of
sam
adams
overall
im
glad
i
had
this
one
again
if
you
can
get
this
beer
fresh
on
tap
or
decently
fresh
in
a
bottle
dont
hesitate
to
call
on
this
after
a
hot
day
i
still
think
that
older
examples
of
this
have
a
wierd
after
taste
but
this
iteration
certaintly
disproved
that
notion
drinkability
for
all
my
complaints
it
isnt
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
but
certainly
no
better
than
okay
i
am
glad
it
has
a
decent
abv
though
if
not
i
would
probably
let
it
stay
in
the
fridge
for
desperate
times
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
little
bit
of
pearl
white
head
and
light
carbonation
there
is
malty
wheat
taste
with
some
hints
of
lemon
neither
were
apparent
in
the
smell
o
k
beer
nothing
great
probably
wouldnt
drink
again
unless
it
was
the
best
beer
available
as
it
was
last
night
when
i
was
eating
dinner
at
red
lobster
pours
a
cloudy
golden
straw
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
very
faint
lemon
and
a
bit
of
spices
which
i
would
normally
associate
with
a
wheat
beer
taste
is
lemon
with
an
adequate
citrus
hoppy
taste
coming
in
a
bit
of
a
wheaty
spicy
flavor
ends
it
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
light
pretty
good
for
a
warm
summer
day
drinkability
is
also
fairly
high
on
this
beer
its
perfect
for
a
nice
easy
relaxing
summer
day
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
adequately
quenchable
when
the
time
calls
for
a
nice
refresher
serving
type
tap
sam
adams
summer
ale
poured
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
dispated
quickly
i
found
the
smell
of
it
to
be
a
bit
offensive
there
was
a
strong
wheat
taste
with
lemon
and
a
delightful
aftertaste
it
was
lighter
but
still
falvorfull
overall
not
their
best
seasonal
but
still
good
d
i
think
its
okay
but
i
can
only
see
myself
having
one
on
occasion
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
its
a
good
summer
seasonal
and
is
very
refreshing
on
warm
days
but
not
something
id
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
there
are
many
better
wheat
beers
out
there
a
nice
and
unique
take
on
the
style
its
great
for
hot
summer
drinking
and
pairs
well
with
a
variety
of
light
fare
overall
a
decent
brew
and
a
nice
summer
seasonal
some
interesting
flavors
are
detectable
and
are
pretty
well
balanced
a
nice
choice
when
you
want
something
refreshing
and
not
too
filling
or
bitter
not
bad
overall
there
are
just
much
better
other
choices
available
i
will
not
buy
this
again
drinkability
for
me
this
is
a
bit
too
funky
for
me
to
have
again
this
is
coming
from
someone
who
likes
wheat
beer
a
lot
i
guess
its
the
grains
of
paradise
pepper
that
is
the
selling
point
and
also
the
culprit
at
the
same
time
maybe
with
fish
chicken
or
white
meat
like
that
maybe
i
cant
believe
the
consensus
has
this
better
than
the
coastal
wheat
drinkability
nothing
special
at
all
here
not
bad
and
probably
a
good
beer
for
hot
summer
days
but
overall
pretty
average
all
said
this
was
simply
a
very
mediocre
beer
i
live
in
a
very
hot
climate
but
i
cant
see
myself
purchasing
this
one
again
there
are
far
too
many
beers
of
its
style
out
there
that
are
superior
certainly
in
the
running
for
my
favorite
wheatbeer
this
brew
is
exactly
what
it
says
it
is
summer
ale
its
perfect
for
summer
its
appearance
is
cloudy
amber
it
smells
of
slight
hops
wheat
and
zesty
citrus
it
tastes
refreshing
its
a
wheat
beer
but
with
the
taste
of
zesty
lemon
citrus
flavors
very
similar
to
magichats
circus
boy
it
has
no
flavors
that
overwhelm
at
any
point
from
first
sip
to
aftertaste
it
presents
a
very
even
pleasant
palette
through
and
through
its
mouthfeel
is
average
nothing
real
special
to
report
here
certainly
not
unpleasant
but
not
really
unique
as
far
a
drinkability
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
beach
out
sailing
camping
hiking
grilling
enjoying
a
number
of
bbq
treats
polishwiffle
ball
or
any
other
number
of
outdoor
summer
activities
this
beer
icechilled
is
a
prime
choice
several
of
them
in
a
row
can
and
should
be
enjoyed
on
the
regular
this
spring
and
summer
notes
i
reviewed
the
blackberry
wit
the
other
day
and
in
terms
of
appearance
and
body
its
much
of
the
same
hence
the
similar
review
id
say
i
prefer
the
blackberry
to
this
one
though
overall
i
enjoyed
the
brew
and
as
with
the
others
in
the
variety
pack
i
think
they
compliment
each
other
very
well
drinkability
oh
so
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
minus
the
heavy
carbonation
very
refreshing
with
the
powerful
lemon
taste
and
light
body
could
probably
fly
through
a
6pack
of
this
if
it
were
hot
enough
for
the
last
two
years
i
was
a
huge
fan
of
sams
summer
ale
when
i
first
tasted
summer
ale
in
08
i
thought
it
was
wonderful
it
had
a
great
taste
from
start
to
finish
last
year
i
was
a
little
less
impressed
this
years
summer
ale
totally
missed
the
mark
in
my
opinion
it
is
great
when
it
first
hit
my
tongue
but
then
there
was
nothing
i
thought
maybe
it
was
me
and
i
asked
others
with
me
what
they
thought
and
they
agreed
that
when
it
first
hits
your
tongue
there
is
a
party
but
no
finish
nothing
i
know
that
every
batch
of
a
seasonal
brew
is
different
but
when
i
have
and
expectation
of
how
something
should
taste
based
on
past
experience
it
is
much
more
disappointing
i
only
hope
that
sams
october
fest
doesnt
disappointment
like
this
beer
did
meh
pretty
drinkable
in
the
summer
even
though
nothing
really
stands
out
i
think
the
citrus
and
odd
spicing
give
it
some
redeeming
qualities
dwhen
its
really
hot
out
and
you
just
did
some
lawn
work
or
we
its
pretty
refreshing
but
other
than
that
its
kind
of
forgettable
taste
lemon
more
nuanced
a
good
light
wheat
style
good
introductory
thing
goin
on
wheat
not
heavy
but
its
there
mouthfeel
goes
from
mild
sour
to
mild
sweet
easy
to
drink
save
for
hot
days
an
okay
summer
beer
after
several
of
these
i
noticed
that
the
aftertaste
is
almost
like
a
cough
drop
or
something
like
that
kinda
weird
i
would
drink
this
again
but
would
probably
not
buy
again
drinkability
have
to
say
this
was
highly
drinkable
and
i
really
did
enjoy
the
balance
to
it
very
easily
sessionable
and
i
can
look
forward
to
seeing
trying
this
on
a
hotter
summer
day
what
took
me
back
from
what
i
remember
it
in
the
past
is
it
has
a
touch
more
bitterness
then
i
remember
and
its
more
drying
on
the
finish
then
sweet
a
good
and
highly
drinkable
beer
i
will
visit
again
in
the
summer
when
looking
for
something
i
dont
need
to
think
about
to
much
and
just
be
refreshed
by
drinkablity
decent
wheat
brew
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
brews
but
this
was
pretty
good
overall
a
decent
summer
brew
worth
a
taste
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
too
highly
though
d
eh
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
it
would
be
a
great
alternative
to
the
mass
produced
crap
for
a
bbq
or
other
event
think
of
it
as
the
beer
snobs
party
beer
i
surely
wouldnt
get
a
12
pack
for
myself
but
a
party
full
of
naughty
coeds
hey
they
gotta
learn
about
real
beer
at
some
point
12oz
eh
how
many
times
does
somebody
bring
this
to
a
party
average
summer
lemony
light
beer
this
is
about
as
average
as
it
gets
for
a
summer
wouldnt
mind
never
having
again
but
ill
take
it
over
coors
any
day
not
taking
too
much
pride
in
this
one
o
respectable
showing
but
the
tank
isnt
what
im
looking
for
in
the
style
quite
disappointed
with
this
sam
adams
offering
being
the
same
premium
price
as
the
boston
lager
i
would
go
with
that
any
day
over
this
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
overall
i
think
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
a
great
deal
going
for
it
a
step
up
from
a
bud
light
for
sure
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
final
thoughts
its
a
bit
odd
i
mean
its
drinkable
but
really
this
really
reminds
me
of
a
cheaper
blander
creemore
kellerbier
with
wheat
added
into
the
mix
all
in
all
id
recommend
a
try
and
it
might
be
your
thing
but
dont
buy
a
whole
six
pack
until
you
scout
it
out
certainly
not
my
favorite
wheat
ale
probably
worse
one
ive
tried
although
i
honestly
havent
had
tons
of
this
type
decent
stuff
and
perhaps
i
should
have
tried
it
when
it
was
fresher
and
when
it
wasnt
a
cold
and
drizzly
early
autumn
day
recommended
but
only
if
you
cant
get
your
hands
on
oberon
dreamweaver
or
a
great
belgian
wit
which
perform
that
same
function
with
greater
results
nose
is
filled
with
lemon
zest
those
pesky
peppery
grains
of
paradise
snappy
wheat
and
mangoes
taste
is
light
and
spicy
with
the
grains
o
paradise
and
wheat
flavors
leading
the
way
the
flavor
feels
a
bit
softer
out
of
the
bottle
than
it
does
on
tap
not
a
good
beer
and
very
disappointing
the
spices
didnt
mix
well
with
the
lemon
andor
wheat
or
grains
and
i
did
not
find
this
beer
refreshing
at
all
not
a
summer
ale
i
would
seek
out
or
have
again
d
flavor
and
smell
kill
it
for
me
patently
average
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smeel
is
slightly
sweet
some
lemon
and
wheat
taste
is
light
and
sweet
some
hints
of
lemon
a
touch
of
hops
is
present
feels
medium
bodiedin
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
a
pretty
good
selection
nice
and
hazy
thin
head
subtle
to
the
nose
crisp
sharp
and
quenching
but
there
is
a
muddy
aftertaste
i
cant
say
that
i
am
really
a
fan
of
this
too
bad
it
might
of
been
better
just
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
wheat
beer
what
i
want
is
something
like
the
mill
street
wit
beer
lots
of
bready
goodness
with
those
citrus
notes
from
good
yeast
drinkability
not
heavy
at
all
lemon
is
refreshing
though
makes
you
thirsty
because
of
the
citrus
moderate
head
of
clean
white
that
drops
off
into
islands
across
the
surface
close
to
zero
lacing
very
mild
haze

the
yelloworange

appreciably
at
the
outer
limits
taut
nose
of
hay
straw
wheat
lemon
peel
more
muted
clove
allspice

becomes
more
bready
as
it

no
fruit
to
speak
of
mediumbodied
in
spite
of
the
active
and
focused
carbonation
comes
across
as
bottom
heavy
moves
slowly
after
mouth
entry
the
lemon
and
orange
citrus
more
pronounced
the
same
for
the
grassiness
hence
has
more
bitterness
and
bite
the
spice
is
more
diffused
and
has
less
impact
the
grain
and
cereal
keep
coming
at
you
if
without
clear
purpose
theres
little
here
that
others
in
the
category
dont
do
better
pretty
sure
the
units
move
due
to
brand
clout
drinkability
a
stable
sessioner
for
summerfall
tasty
without
being
too
heavy
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
it
is
just
spicy
sweet
if
that
makes
sense
it
is
drinkable
especially
on
a
warm
day
but
that
is
about
it
nothing
to
exciting
but
nothing
bad
either
d
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
the
1st
bottle
i
had
i
didnt
care
for
the
2nd
i
had
hours
later
was
really
good
and
the
3rd
that
i
am
now
having
it
not
so
good
again
i
think
the
lemon
and
the
malts
clash
and
make
this
beer
just
soso
definitely
will
never
buy
this
again
couldnt
wait
to
finish
the
case
my
dog
said
no
d
i
didnt
much
care
for
this
the
first
time
i
had
it
but
its
grown
on
me
a
good
summer
beer
d
a
good
summer
brew
and
a
good
wheat
beer
definitely
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
by
the
pool
this
beer
would
be
a
good
contender
if
nothing
else
is
around
that
is
definitely
a
beer
i
would
take
out
fishing
with
me
and
or
to
a
bbq
out
at
the
lake
it
is
a
good
substitute
to
a
hefeweizen
and
it
is
a
beer
i
would
recommend
to
those
who
are
exploring
beers
with
a
citrus
hint
dont
drink
and
review
d
ranks
very
high
in
my
book
on
a
summer
night
i
think
it
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
tasty
refreshing
goes
well
with
or
without
food
and
can
easily
be
drank
all
night
if
need
be
i
havent
tried
yet
but
i
think
it
could
also
balance
out
a
heavy
winter
dinner
very
well
this
isnt
a
wheat
beer
with
overpowering
clove
taste
which
i
find
to
be
an
unfavorable
quality
in
wheat
beers
sam
adams
hit
the
spot
with
this
summer
ale
drinkability
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
with
pizza
burgers
something
like
that
but
on
its
own
just
as
a
drink
to
be
enjoyed
it
really
doesnt
stand
up
am
i
the
only
person
who
thinks
that
sam
adams
is
in
general
overrated
nothing
special
about
this
one
but
the
price
this
is
certainly
a
summer
brew
im
not
a
big
fan
a
beers
such
as
this
however
i
do
believe
that
for
a
light
summer
brew
this
is
well
done
good
example
of
a
wheat
beer
that
doesnt
overpower
with
banana
and
clove
flavors
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
more
either
taste
is
light
and
spicy
with
the
grains
o
paradise
and
wheat
flavors
leading
the
way
the
flavor
feels
a
bit
softer
out
of
the
bottle
than
it
does
on
tap
i
do
not
like
the
aftertaste
on
this
beer
it
is
a
bit
sour
citrusly
pithy
and
lingers
for
far
too
long
this
falls
somewhere
between
a
witbier
and
an
american
wheat
ale
but
does
nothing
to
impress
this
is
extremely
far
from
my
favorite
summer
beers
after
numerous
different
beers
tasted
over
the
years
i
have
to
remove
my
hat
for
summer
ale
it
has
to
be
my
alltime
favorite
a
fan
of
sam
to
begin
with
i
could
not
help
but
easily
enjoy
summer
ale
i
miss
it
when
its
off
the
shelves
and
i
buy
out
the
store
when
its
in
season
a
great
refreshing
taste
a
summer
ale
with
some
nice
heft
the
mouthfeel
keeps
things
crisp
and
light
but
quite
full
making
this
quite
drinakable
alone
but
i
can
just
see
this
going
with
grilled
garlic
shrimp
d
ive
tried
this
beer
over
and
over
before
i
reviewed
it
trying
to
like
it
i
just
cant
do
it
the
tastes
are
so
odd
to
me
its
like
it
wants
to
be
a
goodtasting
beer
but
the
flavors
just
dont
meld
well
and
become
odd
could
hardly
finish
one
and
i
was
really
thirsty
crisp
and
refreshing
what
more
could
you
ask
for
a
summer
wheat
ale
a
very
good
seasonal
you
could
easily
drink
many
of
these
with
friends
at
a
backyard
barbecue
the
taste
has
very
little
to
report
because
it
is
a
pretty
simple
unidimensional
beer
it
is
just
refreshing
there
is
a
touch
of
some
grainy
husk
there
is
some
lemony
tartness
maybe
but
overall
it
is
a
lawn
mower
beer
with
fancy
labeling
its
okay
for
a
barbeque
on
a
hot
summer
day
however
for
some
reason
at
the
brewery
the
spices
seemed
subtler
in
the
background
and
since
theres
not
much
else
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
made
this
beer
quite
refreshing
considering
the
heat
a
slight
malt
sweetness
comes
in
after
hay
wheat
flavor
and
the
spice
is
slight
but
lingers
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
fine
you
can
really
feel
the
flavors
which
is
a
victory
considering
how
little
there
seems
to
be
very
drinkable
but
also
kind
of
drab
tastes
like
an
upgraded
bmc
with
wheat
flavor
there
could
be
alot
more
here
t
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
ale
and
the
first
beer
i
think
of
when
it
comes
to
summer
ales
not
my
favorite
summer
seasonal
but
still
a
quality
ale
drinkability
definitely
a
solid
summer
brew
not
much
in
the
nose
and
not
much
in
the
way
of
taste
but
the
sessionability
of
this
one
on
a
summer
day
is
going
to
be
tough
to
beat
drinkability
easy
drinking
not
much
to
this
one
though
i
like
this
beer
this
is
one
of
the
few
sam
products
ill
consistently
order
in
the
summer
pours
a
light
straw
yellow
with
minimal
head
goes
great
paired
with
food
and
is
perfect
on
a
hot
day
taste
is
mainly
a
lemony
acidity
and
a
hop
crispness
with
a
mild
spice
good
solid
flavor
composition
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
too
one
could
drink
46
of
these
on
a
beach
and
feel
fantastic
light
enought
to
be
a
good
summer
beer
but
not
light
on
flavor
this
is
a
perfect
warmweather
brew
and
at
a
buck
a
bottle
retail
give
or
take
or
34
a
pint
its
an
incredible
deal
poured
a
cloudy
hazy
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
nose
is
floral
hops
lemonorange
peel
and
a
wheaty
grain
taste
is
smooth
hoppy
a
bit
of
malt
but
not
much
and
a
slight
yeast
aftertaste
easily
drinkable
especially
and
i
would
think
a
great
session
beer
i
really
liked
it
overall
not
seeing
this
as
a
solid
summer
offeringin
fact
it
seems
a
bit
too
malty
like
some
other
sam
adams
beers
are
that
lager
a
bit
too
heavyzesty
perhaps
but
the
malt
seems
to
suck
much
of
the
refreshment
out
of
itand
refreshment
is
a
summer
ales
first
priority
no
da
great
summer
ale
that
isnt
too
light
brings
plenty
of
flavour
yet
is
something
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
on
a
warm
day
this
was
a
very
easy
drinker
im
usually
enjoy
the
majority
of
sam
adams
offerings
but
this
wasnt
for
me
a
little
too
watery
and
thin
pours
a
yellow
orange
slightly
hazy
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
is
fluffy
and
white
the
smell
is
of
spice
notes
with
a
small
amount
of
malt
and
some
lemon
aromas
the
taste
is
of
citrus
up
front
in
the
middle
there
is
a
spicy
note
finished
off
by
a
lemon
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
high
in
carbonation
overall
the
drinkability
on
this
is
good
you
will
for
sure
want
more
than
one
but
the
lemon
could
get
old
after
a
good
amount

with
a
twoinch
billowy
bright
white
head
that
lost
half
its
volume
within
a
minute
nose
reveals
a
sweet
spicy
character
light
malt
and
the
merest
suggestion
of
citrus
taste
is
somewhat
consistent
with

but
also
buttery
and
biscuity
with
a
slight
citrus
astringency
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
between
light
and
mediumbodied
lightly
effervescent
and
also
a
little
slick
not
loving
the
taste
on
this
one
perhaps
one
of
my
least
favorite
sa
offerings
theres
just
a
weird
cloyingsweetspicy
character
to
this
one
that
impacts
its
sessionability
pours
a
cloudy
yellowgolden
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
taste
are
very
good
hoppy
citrusy
hints
of
grapefruit
nice
dry
finish
pretty
smooth
for
a
wheat
ale
id
rate
the
drinkability
as
pretty
high
but
i
must
admit
that
at
a
summer
bbq
after
three
or
four
of
these
i
was
kinda
yearning
for
something
a
little
crisper
overall
tho
very
good
beer
sadly
i
must
say
that
whatever
appeal
this
beer
once
had
for
me
is
greatly
reduced
d
drinkable
enough
just
not
much
in
terms
of
remarkable
flavor
seems
to
be
a
very
safe
middle
of
the
road
brew
i
think
this
would
be
good
at
gatherings
but
i
would
get
bored
with
too
much
of
this
there
just
isnt
much
to
offer
here
very
drinkable
and
very
non
offensive
this
brew
lacks
alot
of
character
but
is
still
good
for
a
session
nice
on
a
hot
day
cheers
a
fairly
decent
brew
but
i
seem
to
remember
it
being
significantly
better
ontap
overall
pretty
good
not
a
lot
to
make
it
stand
out
from
other
summery
citrus
wheat
beers
however
drinkability
i
must
say
this
simple
refreshing
drink
was
the
perfect
beer
to
have
when
being
done
with
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
otherwise
i
do
not
think
i
will
be
picking
this
one
up
again
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
creamy
white
head
it
was
gold
in
color
and
cloudy
i
got
the
lemon
scent
right
away
followed
by
the
wheat
i
tasted
the
lemon
up
front
and
got
the
spicy
bready
taste
on
the
back
end
it
tastes
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
i
am
on
my
second
and
see
no
problem
finishing
the
other
two
i
have
left
i
may
drink
it
again
this
beer
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
from
sa
cant
go
wrong
on
a
hot
summer
night
with
some
of
these
around
d
pretty
easy
drink
i
went
through
a
couple
of
these
before
i
knew
it
the
only
problem
is
that
the
citrus
flavor
becomes
a
little
too
much
after
a
couple
drinkability
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
california
summer
sunday
sitting
outside
doing
this
review
and
drinking
this
makes
me
enjoy
it
all
the
more
and
it
really
does
hit
the
spot
right
now
drinkability
was
excellent
this
beer
complemented
my
steak
and
mashed
potatoes
perfectly
on
a
summer
day
an
enjoyable
brew
its
above
average
for
the
style
but
not
spectacular
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
its
not
complex
and
its
not
packed
with
flavor
but
it
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
it
is
also
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
and
humid
day
its
even
something
that
most
noncraft
beer
drinkers
can
enjoy
definitely
something
i
look
forward
to
every
summer
taste
the
taste
doesnt
come
together
quite
as
nicely
as
the
smell
of
the
beer
does
still
pretty
tasty
though
the
grains
of
paradise
give
it
a
certain
hearty
character
that
sets
it
apart
from
other
wheat
beers
by
far
my
worst
experience
with
the
boston
brewing
company
summer
ale
was
not
nearly
as
good
as
we
had
hoped
and
we
were
scratching
our
heads
trying
to
figure
out
what
we
were
missing
i
started
to
wonder
if
we
got
a
bad
six
however
there
was
nothing
obvious
to
say
that
this
beer
was
damaged
or
very
old
i
hate
blasting
this
beer
but
compared
to
gumballhead
honey
moon
312
etc
this
one
didnt
live
up
to
the
mark
not
much
to
talk
about
here
a
basic
example
of
the
style
altogether
a
nice
beer
for
what
it
is
its
a
thirst
quencher
which
makes
it
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
although
not
my
favorite
flavor
profile
i
could
definitely
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
pours
a
hazy
cloudy
orangishyellow
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
quickly
settles
down
to
about
14
active
carbonation
lots
of
tiiny
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
aroma
is
tangy
and
citrusy
definite
hints
of
lemon
taste
is
crisp
refreshing
clean
wheatiness
with
a
nice
lemon
peel
bite
a
hint
of
spiciness
theres
a
nice
creaminess
to
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
good
thirst
quenching
summer
beer
after
working
in
the
hot
sun
all
day
a
couple
of
these
really
hit
the
spot
i
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
so
if
you
like
them
then
you
shouldnt
have
read
this
review
best
before
date
april
2010
pretty
nice
appearance
good
combination
of
components
in
the
nose
although
subtle
nice
light
flavor
with
good
combo
of
summer
elements
in
there
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
quaff
summer
or
otherwise
prost
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
a
1
5
finger
head
that
faded
quickly
the
taste
is
citrus
with
a
hint
of
spice
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
possibly
corriander
overall
a
very
light
refreshing
taste
pretty
good
drinkability
as
it
is
not
hoppy
in
the
least
a
good
basic
beer
but
not
something
i
would
have
to
have
as
it
were
two
in
im
done
here
overall
pretty
nice
and
refreshing
d
this
beer
isnt
drinkable
at
all
in
my
opinion
i
would
definatly
not
recommend
it
ive
had
this
beer
before
at
bars
but
since
i
cant
smell
very
well
i
never
noticed
this
beers
odd
smell
its
not
strong
but
doesnt
give
a
good
intro
to
the
beer
decent
tasting
beer
for
the
summer
though
overall
one
of
my
new
favorites
from
sam
adams
and
i
believe
ill
be
downing
these
all
summer
because
specs
has
them
on
sale
for
5
99
a
six
pack
till
august
1st
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
this
beer
was
not
surprisingly
crisp
and
very
refreshing
has
an
almost
watered
down
taste
to
it
on
the
finish
as
well
as
a
crisp
mouthfeel
and
that
really
makes
this
beer
highly
drinkable
you
could
easily
throw
back
several
of
these
on
a
scorching
hot
day
i
really
loved
the
way
the
mouthfeel
compliments
the
flavor
profile
nothing
was
really
lacking
with
this
one
its
pretty
well
balanced
highly
enjoyable
i
say
run
out
on
the
hottest
day
of
the
summer
pick
up
a
case
of
this
zesty
and
refreshing
brew
you
wont
be
disappointed
cheers
very
bright
slightly
cloudy
in
the
glass
with
a
whitish
yellow
head
citrusey
with
a
crisp
fruity
aroma
im
going
to
compare
this
one
to
the
nit
witbjs
as
far
as
initial
taste
i
consider
this
one
to
be
much
better
though
the
taste
is
much
better
throughout
heavier
fuller
flavor
in
this
one
with
a
spicy
after
sweeter
than
i
expected
nice
heavier
texture
like
an
ale
should
be
with
a
smooth
swallow
drinkability
is
very
good
heavy
flavors
and
spices
are
definitely
a
good
paring
with
a
nice
ribeye
or
tritip
good
drinking
summer
beer
but
not
especially
noteworthy
while
you
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
if
you
wanted
would
you
want
to
i
tried
giving
this
beer
another
chance
looking
for
a
good
lighter
warm
weather
beer
but
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
i
drank
this
sixer
quickly
just
to
get
rid
of
it
an
okay
wheat
beer
for
the
summer
d
i
may
have
to
change
this
to
a
5
after
another
but
this
beer
takes
the
american
wheat
style
up
a
couple
steps
from
the
usual
expectations
as
is
its
title
this
is
a
great
summer
thirstquencher
not
exactly
the
kind
of
beer
id
crave
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
definitely
not
bad
d
easily
drinkable
if
only
it
tasted
a
little
better
d
3
5
goes
down
easy
this
brew
is
my
least
favorite
seasonal
from
bbc
to
date
not
bad
just
not
great
drinkability
the
name
says
it
all
cause
i
wouldnt
be
drinking
this
any
other
time
than
the
summer
nor
would
i
ask
for
this
at
a
barrestaurant
definitely
an
average
beer
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
steak
or
burger
because
it
will
not
be
too
filling
and
would
complement
food
made
on
the
grill
pretty
well
dthis
crisp
summer
ale
is
a
very
good
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
had
on
tap
at
a
restaurant
at
dallas
fort
worth
airport
during
a
nearly
infinite
layover
the
beer
was
clear
golden
color
with
a
standard
foam
cap
not
much
in
the
aroma
very
muted
spice
maybe
but
more
likely
just
the
smell
of
malt
and
hope
not
hops
the
taste
is
not
spiced
nor
hopped
more
just
a
bland
american
wheat
ale
meh
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
should
have
gone
for
the
boston
lager
not
recommended
this
is
my
favorite
of
all
the
sam
adams
beers
say
what
you
will
i
really
only
buy
this
one
consistently
and
only
during
the
summer
obviously
ive
yet
to
find
an
american
brewery
producing
a
summer
ale
that
is
as
good
or
better
than
this
is
it
the
best
beer
in
the
world
no
of
course
not
is
it
crisp
and
refreshing
and
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
outside
yes
its
an
okay
beer
but
i
cant
imagine
seeking
it
out
the
appearance
was
pretty
typical
of
a
summer
brew
poured
with
a
little
bit
of
head
that
faded
quickly
smell
was
average
for
a
similar
beers
the
taste
was
something
i
wasnt
expecting
at
all
it
was
very
tangy
and
was
almost
a
chore
to
swallow
after
awhile
the
mouthfeel
was
usual
but
the
tanginess
was
very
undesirable
and
made
the
drinkability
score
pretty
low
too
i
will
definitely
not
be
picking
this
one
up
again
taste
is
fruity
but
tart
and
a
bit
yeasty
slightly
offtasting
not
terribly
clean
ever
so
bitter
aftertaste
sweet
spice
touch
of
coriander
perhaps
mouthfeel
was
decent
carbonation
was
acceptable
goes
down
easily
no
struggle
overall
not
a
bad
sam
adams
offering
but
nothing
special
either
d
im
not
too
sure
about
the
drinkability
based
on
the
first
impression
im
going
to
have
to
go
out
and
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
to
rate
it
correctly
based
on
the
body
and
how
the
beer
is
supposed
to
taste
id
imagine
it
would
be
pretty
drinkable
wonderfully
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
americanstyle
wheat
ales
dominating
the
seasonal
summer
releases
easydowning
yet
interesting
wellbalanced
and
very
refreshing
drinkability
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
its
great
on
a
hot
day
and
for
me
it
would
be
great
just
about
any
other
time
d
high
this
is
my
go
to
beer
for
summer
the
grains
of
paradise
in
this
must
be
the
ticket
it
just
goes
very
well
with
hot
weather
drinkability
ill
use
the
word
unique
again
i
liked
it
and
recommend
it
heavier
than
most
summer
brews
but
thats
probably
why
i
liked
it
d
i
could
drink
this
brew
on
a
warm
summer
day
quenching
and
refreshing
brew
drinks
very
well
and
is
incredibly
refreshing
sam
adams
summer
ale
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
small
white
head
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
was
very
interesting
hints
of
sea
shore
and
lemon
the
taste
was
of
sea
salt
with
hints
of
lemon
and
bread
mouthfeel
was
a
little
heavy
the
drinkability
was
nice
spot
on
for
a
summer
wheat
beer
overall
this
beer
was
ok
nothing
really
challenging
here
but
this
serves
its
purpose
its
a
nice
easy
drinker
good
for
summer
drinking
in
the
sun
not
sam
adams
best
offering
but
still
might
be
a
decent
choice
in
a
bar
with
limited
selection
or
as
a
refreshing
brew
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
smells
fairly
bright
citrus
dunno
if
its
from
actual
citrus
or
the
yeast
is
dominant
on
the
nose
i
can
also
smell
some
floral
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
i
feel
like
it
should
be
a
bit
more
carbonated
for
a
wheat
a
little
sweet
and
bready
spices
run
throughout
it
i
taste
a
lot
of
coriander
it
certainly
isnt
as
boring
as
a
lot
of
other
american
wheats
are
when
poured
into
the
glass
it
carried
a
small
amount
of
foam
very
light
wheat
in
color
almost
white
and
dissapated
quickly
the
color
was
a
rich
hazy
golden
honey
the
smell
had
a
lemonyorange
zest
with
an
equal
balance
of
hops
and
wheat
and
a
hint
of
honey
the
taste
was
an
exact
mirror
of
the
smell
drinkability
easy
on
the
palate
and
easy
going
down
witha
dry
aftertaste
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
very
subtle
graininess
like
almost
all
of
the
other
beers
from
the
boston
beer
company
this
one
does
not
disappoint
i
would
rate
this
as
an
excellent
summer
beer
its
a
wellbalanced
beer
because
each
element
of
flavor
remains
distinct
without
being
too
overpowering
this
beer
would
be
as
great
of
a
companion
on
a
grilling
oddesy
as
it
would
be
after
doing
yardwork
all
day
enjoy
it
while
its
out
d
moderate
flavor
strength
and
refreshing
enough
quite
drinkable
had
this
at
the
philly
airport
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
white
head
that
faded
quickly
but
left
good
lacing
smelled
of
wheat
malts
and
lemon
tasted
lemony
and
a
bit
grainy
fairly
smooth
but
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
overall
not
a
beer
that
i
would
have
more
than
one
of
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
very
refreshing
and
more
unique
than
other
beer
i
felt
it
did
ok
in
both
those
areas
but
it
could
have
been
better
it
certainly
wasnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
it
had
good
flavor
and
i
liked
the
subtle
differences
it
had
but
in
the
end
i
wish
it
would
have
maintained
the
drinkability
but
had
more
flavor
like
i
later
found
boston
lager
to
have
i
think
i
would
try
it
again
one
day
but
so
far
i
would
reach
for
something
else
before
i
went
for
this
again
on
a
warm
summer
night
d
very
drinkable
easy
to
know
a
few
back
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
decent
head
that
leaves
some
thin
lacing
the
smell
is
that
of
malt
grains
spice
and
citrus
the
taste
is
a
nice
grainy
citrus
taste
quite
flavorfully
but
not
overpoweringly
sweet
and
spicy
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
crisp
it
finishes
dry
and
lingers
well
this
one
could
easily
be
a
regular
pours
a
very
light
orange
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
quickly
and
does
not
lace
at
all
smells
faintly
spicy
and
a
tad
hoppy
but
no
malt
character
tastes
very
bitter
and
over
hopped
there
is
a
large
dose
of
spices
which
is
unwelcome
without
some
sweet
malt
backbone
but
this
beer
has
no
malt
presence
whatsoever
mouthfeel
is
too
thick
for
a
beer
that
is
supposed
to
be
refreshing
drinkability
is
low
this
should
be
much
lighter
and
much
milder
and
much
tastier
as
for
drinkability
i
cant
complain
drinkability
so
my
first
bottle
out
of
this
sixer
may
not
have
done
it
for
me
but
this
one
seems
to
be
right
on
par
with
what
i
remember
not
the
best
apwa
going
tough
to
compete
with
the
likes
of
gumballhead
but
its
certainly
solid
and
i
will
enjoy
it
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
this
was
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
have
again
for
sure
and
now
i
know
what
summer
tastes
like
drinkability
a
great
mowing
the
lawn
or
session
beer
perfect
for
summer
a
great
summer
ale
certainly
successful
in
completing
its
intentions
i
recommend
it
d
if
i
were
going
to
buy
an
ale
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
would
not
be
my
top
choice
not
as
refreshing
or
crisp
as
i
had
expected
nikki
from
the
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
it
showed
a
nice
white
head
and
a
clear
yellowish
light
wheat
color
good
carbonation
aroma
was
not
strong
slight
grains
citrus
and
malt
evident
taste
is
light
on
hops
with
a
touch
of
citrus
grain
and
malt
that
became
less
evident
over
time
it
has
a
rather
smooth
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
really
easy
a
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
summer
ale
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
conclusion
just
kind
of
unsorted
also
kind
of
an
odd
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
tried
this
a
year
or
two
ago
and
wasnt
a
huge
fan
now
that
im
reviewing
it
im
still
not
d
goes
down
really
easy
good
beer
to
drink
at
the
beach
d
a
good
sunshine
brew
one
of
my
top
three
as
a
matter
of
fact
recommended
drink
is
good
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
liking
but
a
definite
for
a
hot
summer
day
not
really
a
session
beer
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
it
has
a
nice
light
golden
color
and
the
aroma
is
different
you
get
a
lot
of
lemon
and
spice
immediately
the
taste
matches
the
smell
as
well
strong
citrus
flavors
in
a
light
crisp
taste
very
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
not
in
more
normal
taste
range
it
was
interesting
to
try
it
out
i
would
chose
this
again
i
ate
some
strawberries
with
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
in
late
may
and
they
went
well
together
d
the
drinkability
would
be
there
for
me
if
there
was
a
little
more
flavor
its
a
great
summer
beer
very
refreshing
just
not
nearly
as
good
as
goose
islands
summertime
to
warrant
buying
this
seasonal
again
md
surprisingly
dry
finish
felt
alcohol
in
the
throat
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
wispy
lacing
left
on
the
glass
nose
is
mostly
of
citrus
lemon
being
the
most
prevalent
with
a
touch
of
malts
and
yeast
taste
is
starts
with
grany
malts
malts
and
then
of
sweet
malts
and
spices
it
is
then
followed
by
sharp
lemon
flavor
and
a
slight
bitterness
this
is
a
lighter
bodied
beer
decent
carbonation
lemon
bitterness
aftertaste
to
it
relatively
drinkable
especially
to
the
abv
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
so
this
makes
for
a
great
beer
for
what
it
is
a
summer
ale
and
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
few
after
a
hot
day
cutting
the
grass
would
be
a
great
camping
sessiontype
beer
d
very
drinkable
fresh
and
light
definitely
a
good
summer
ale
overall
its
one
of
my
least
favorite
sam
adams
but
still
a
decent
pick
up
d
very
drinkable
delicious
wheat
ale
for
spring
and
summer
need
to
be
sitting
outside
to
fully
enjoy
this
one
mmm
its
a
rather
refreshing
brew
i
think
the
taste
is
about
equal
on
tap
and
bottle
i
think
i
will
be
buying
this
beer
again
pretty
soon
it
goes
great
with
bbq
on
a
nice
hot
sunny
day
final
thoughts
an
interesting
twist
on
the
style
but
i
expected
something
more
from
such
a
well
respected
brewery
and
what
is
supposedly
their
best
selling
of
all
seasonals
until
i
had
the
brooklyn
summer
ale
this
was
my
favorite
summer
ale
i
have
had
this
on
many
occasions
both
on
tap
and
bottle
but
most
recently
in
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
of
mostly
citrus
and
some
light
pepper
taste
has
more
of
lemon
orange
and
some
light
spices
some
light
acidity
kicks
in
as
well
it
has
a
nice
dry
finish
will
definately
try
again
d
a
solid
refreshing
option
from
sam
adams
i
had
this
on
tap
last
night
and
was
pretty
unimpressed
but
this
is
somewhat
more
focused
and
coherent
from
the
bottle
this
would
be
nice
to
drink
while
grilling
or
sitting
on
the
beach
this
is
a
decent
beer
made
for
the
summer
with
temperatures
close
to
ninety
its
a
good
fit
for
today
though
the
lemon
is
part
of
the
equation
its
not
as
overpowering
as
i
expected
it
to
be
overall
a
little
bland
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
it
again
if
there
were
few
choices
the
beer
is
certainly
refreshing
but
the
sour
is
a
bit
off
putting
all
the
way
throught
the
beer
good
but
not
great
cloudy
and
muddy
quite
opaque
can
barely
see
my
hand
on
the
other
side
through
glass
head
is
big
and
pillowy
with
lacing
all
down
the
sides
smell
is
grassy
and
lemony
quite
malty
the
spices
arent
really
noticable
in
the
nose
taste
is
lemon
at
the
end
then
comes
a
floral
spiciness
the
spices
they
use
do
come
through
in
the
taste
but
seem
rather
out
of
place
overall
kind
of
a
strange
taste
to
this
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
chewy
a
good
level
of
carbonation
d
this
beer
makes
me
sad
very
poor
offering
from
a
company
that
can
do
much
better
this
beer
is
an
odd
mix
of
flavors
on
a
very
heavy
beer
for
a
summer
brew
d
ridiculously
drinkable
the
aim
of
every
summer
beer
d
good
brew
here
drinkable
you
bet
not
as
easy
drinking
as
some
summer
brews
but
great
for
what
it
is
not
a
mindblowing
experience
but
nothing
to
turn
down
either
i
had
a
couple
before
moving
on
d
there
was
too
much
citrus
fruitspice
flavor
going
on
here
for
me
to
enjoy
the
wheat
ive
had
this
from
a
bottle
before
and
it
seemed
way
more
subdued
so
ill
probably
stick
to
that
overall
not
the
best
ive
had
like
this
i
much
prefer
north
coasts
blue
star
but
this
is
pretty
good
and
easier
to
get
fresh
i
prefer
to
drink
this
out
of
the
bottle
for
some
reason
i
didnt
like
the
tap
version
of
the
summer
ale
however
it
wasnt
horrible
it
remains
my
top
choice
of
ontap
beers
at
my
local
bar
it
was
served
to
me
in
a
pint
glass
with
no
head
i
could
smell
an
aroma
of
fruit
and
mild
hops
it
is
very
drinkable
but
as
i
said
i
prefer
to
drink
it
from
the
bottle
its
one
of
the
best
wheat
ales
sam
adams
has
to
offer
gotten
out
of
the
sam
adams
variety
pack
i
believe
this
was
the
first
wheat
beer
i
enjoyed
i
used
to
hate
everything
wheat
other
than
this
still
holds
up
pretty
well
for
me
a
gold
appearance
smells
a
lot
like
lemon
rinds
all
at
once
citrus
mixed
with
a
slight
hop
character
and
the
tastes
classic
of
a
wheat
decent
drinkability
and
decent
mouthfeel
i
generally
cant
appreciate
wheat
beers
for
their
lackluster
light
uncompromising
style
i
want
depth
not
something
to
drink
on
the
beach
this
has
as
much
depth
as
a
kiddy
pool
overall
a
sessionable
summer
beer
with
sone
nice
flavors
however
it
is
a
bit
generic
as
there
is
nothing
particularly
unique
about
this
beer
a
good
option
either
as
a
light
summer
beer
or
a
gateway
beer
for
macro
drinkers
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
the
flavors
bring
about
the
feeling
of
summer
it
is
a
really
good
beer
for
the
summer
and
would
go
well
with
some
nice
baribcue
chicken
and
hot
dogs
d
very
drinkable
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
with
no
problem
would
be
very
refreshing
during
the
summer
drinkability
i
had
this
on
tap
last
night
at
the
99
because
there
were
not
many
alternatives
maybe
it
is
new
recipe
but
i
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
i
remembered
liking
it
before
i
have
not
had
one
in
a
couple
of
years
it
seemed
fresh
and
tasty
i
could
session
these
based
off
of
last
nights
draft
experience
this
is
a
golden
beer
without
alot
going
on
as
far
as
head
is
concerned
smells
of
sweet
bread
the
taste
is
better
than
the
spring
ale
though
with
the
citrus
and
spiciness
very
drinkable
and
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
for
a
summer
beer
plenty
of
carbonation
its
ok
d
this
was
a
very
good
beer
the
addition
of
the
spice
did
make
this
quite
as
refreshing
as
summer
ale
should
be
in
my
opinion
but
it
was
still
good
d
one
or
two
would
be
alright
whatever
that
tastefeel
i
am
calling
chalky
is
leaves
me
feeling
that
it
is
not
up
to
par
with
other
summer
beers
however
i
have
heard
it
is
better
on
tap
so
i
will
give
it
another
chance
overall
late
night
in
the
basement
isnt
exactly
the
perfect
place
to
be
drinking
summer
ale
nevertheless
its
a
solid
summer
offering
will
definitely
consider
again
high
drinkability
the
flavors
never
get
old
to
me
and
is
another
good
offering
from
samuel
adams
cheers
d
very
drinkable
this
will
be
great
on
a
hot
day
im
looking
forward
to
having
some
of
these
over
the
summer
this
is
the
first
summer
ale
of
the
year
yea
summer
is
here
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
when
it
gets
hot
in
florida
for
example
it
was
in
the
upper
80s
low
90s
today
and
the
first
one
i
had
disappeared
like
a
copperfield
act
i
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
bottle
of
this
and
as
a
summer
seasonal
the
astringent
plasticky
taste
is
enough
to
ruin
the
thirstquenching
potential
of
this
beer
final
thoughts
decent
beer
from
sam
adams
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
i
was
absolutely
obsessed
with
it
and
purchased
it
as
often
as
i
could
since
i
have
gotten
into
craft
beers
i
have
discovered
better
options
however
this
is
not
a
bad
offering
cheers
d
excellent
nothing
to
wow
you
here
just
a
pleasant
easy
drinking
summer
ale
this
brew
has
really
grown
on
me
and
is
now
sort
of
a
guilty
pleasure
for
me
light
in
taste
i
wished
for
a
little
more
in
that
department
but
it
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
summer
session
great
pair
with
thai
food
pretty
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
or
maybe
good
as
a
lawn
mower
beer
like
most
sa
products
nothing
great
but
still
a
pretty
solid
offering
and
a
decent
seasonal
a
well
put
together
and
refreshing
beer
worth
trying
and
definetly
a
sessionable
one
for
the
summer
the
taste
is
about
the
same
thin
white
wine
hints
of
fruit
candy
and
lemon
with
a
finish
of
lemon
crackers
and
hint
of
bread
its
light
and
zesty
with
some
flavour
yet
with
a
definite
alcoholic
note
that
soon
detracts
and
the
charscter
soon
becomes
a
bit
rough
and
thin
i
guess
i
expected
more
just
not
a
beer
i
would
want
to
go
out
and
buy
again
d
quite
easy
to
drink
really
this
is
a
great
summer
afternoon
beer
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
refreshing
pours
an
orangish
body
not
purely
seethrough
white
head
small
diminishing
very
malty
aroma
some
spices
some
hops
very
weak
somewhat
bitter
some
spice
flowers
floral
on
the
aftertaste
carbonated
but
flat
on
flavor
pours
a
deep
gold
with
a
touch
of
cloudy
hazebig
lasting
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
zestymalty
wheaty
and
has
a
little
spice
a
hint
of
pepper
from
the
grains
of
paradise
i
guess
the
flavor
is
delightful
and
quenching
it
starts
with
tasty
breadybiscuit
malts
with
a
distinct
note
of
wheat
malt
there
is
a
refreshing
touch
of
citrus
from
the
lemon
zest
there
is
a
balancing
level
of
hop
bitterness
but
the
beer
is
not
particularly
bitter
it
finishes
a
little
dry
refreshing
and
spicy
from
noble
hops
and
grains
of
paradise
there
is
a
subtle
touch
of
lemon
zest
lingering
in
the
finish
too
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
full
for
such
a
refreshing
lightfeeling
beer
lots
of
carbonation
that
seems
to
make
it
just
a
little
lighter
a
very
nice
beer
drinkability
a
bit
of
a
plebeian
brew
from
americas
first
craft
brewery
drinkable
of
course
but
which
typical
sam
adams
brew
really
isnt
nothing
stands
out
though
and
i
think
this
might
actually
suffer
from
blandness
other
beers
its
their
badness
that
gives
them
character
in
their
attempt
to
appeal
to
the
masses
sam
adams
has
made
their
beers
too
generictasting
nahh
the
run
of
good
samuel

brews
ended
with
this
one
golden

into
a
medium
white
frothy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
aroma
of
yeasty
malts
wheat
bread
lemon
and
citrus
with
hints
of
peppery
spices
initial
flavor
of
malty
citrus
with
a
dry
lightly
hopped
finish
too
citrusy

my

more

i
like
this
relative
to

i

most
other

over
this
i

to

about
this

was
one
of
my
favorites
a

years

i
still
enjoy
it

have
since
discovered
other
beers
namely
certain
hefeweizens
such
as
franziskaner
that
i
prefer
over

as
my
summer

the
beer
was

of
lemons
malt
and

together
got
my
taste
buds
watering
the

lemons
and
wheat
was
palate
pleasing
but
the
finish
was
slightly
askew
the
finished
tasted
like
a
very
sour
lemon
but
overall
it
was
refreshing
smooth
citrusy
wheat
beer
pours
murky
orange
almost
like
a
watereddown

juice
lots
of
lemons
in
the
aroma
with
a

infinitely

d
highly
drinkable
refreshing
and
flavorful
ive
spent
many
a
great
evening
by
the
grill
with
a
summer
ale
in
my
hand
and
i
look
forward
to
many
more
it
has
a
real
faint
aroma
there
are
some
bean
and
malt
tones
the
body
was
nice
there
was
an
off
white
nice
two
and
half
fingers
of
head
the
body
is
a
golden
honey
like
amber
it
has
a
great
citrus
and
mildly
spicy
taste
a
little
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
average
a
little
bite
but
not
much
at
all
a
crisp
clean
beer
with
very
little
if
any
aftertaste
sometimes
the
beer
would
have
an
excellent
light
and
crisp
citrusy
note
and
sometimes
it
would
not
very
minimal
lace
around
the
glass
as
i
drank
this
beer
overall
i
would
consider
this
a
beer
that
would
be
very
palatable
on
hot
summer
days
drinkability
crisp
refreshing
light
to
medium
so
good
for
this
could
go
through
these
fairly
easily
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
a
solid
performer
nonetheless
id
take
this
over
a
blue
moon
any
day
another
fine
sam
adams
session
beer
nothing
thats
going
to
take
your
breath
away
but
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
summer
beer
this
is
not
the
best
beer
that
sam
adams
has
done
but
it
is
a
beer
i
do
enjoy
in
the
summer
months
it
has
a
nice
taste
with
just
a
bit
of
citric
to
it
not
a
beer
that
will
blow
you
away
but
a
good
go
to
beer
for
the
summer
days
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
its
a
refreshing
ale
and
goes
good
with
a
hamburger
right
off
the
grill
i
would
recommend
this
one
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
it
good
but
somewhat
average
nothing
beats
a
nice
sam
adams
summer
ale
on
a
hot
day
in
junejuly
so
damn
refreshing
and
crisp
it
is
super
drinkable
has
just
enough
of
that
lemoncitrusy
kick
at
the
end
ot
make
it
interesting
but
not
too
much
i
look
forward
to
every
may
when
this
begins
to
start
rolling
out
d
a
good
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
these
in
the
summer
after
a
day
outside
poured
a
hazed
orangered
color
with
a
thin
stable
white
head
did
not
smell
good
i
think
it
was
a
little
old
smelled
a
little
skunked
didnt
taste
that
way
though
lots
of
wheat
flavors
with
a
slight
ctirus
taste
decent
hops
didnt
go
perfectly
with
the
citrus
but
it
was
decent
one
was
enough
not
too
crazy
about
it
but
try
it
if
you
havent
had
it
d
a
nice
summer
cooler
from
sa
the
tanginess
is
a
touch
that
increases
the
quench
factor
d
not
to
bad
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
as
the
name
implies
sam
adams
summer
ale
is
made
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
night
a
thirst
quencher
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
all
that
exciting
a
fall
back
for
me
if
there
is
nothing
better
to
ad
a
slight
zing
i
like
this
sa
style
very
much

d
yuck
doesnt
seem
worthy
of
beer
label
dumped
last
couple
inches
im
not
impressed
with
this
beer
it
has
almost
no
taste
it
is
certainly
better
than
a
bud
light
or
coors
or
junk
like
that
but
i
expect
more
flavor
than
this
it
has
a
smell
average
but
present
and
the
feel
is
also
average
depending
on
your
standards
the
drinkability
will
vary
i
like
to
be
interested
with
every
sip
and
since
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
taste
i
wouldnt
drink
another
one
not
recommended
but
if
youre
not
looking
for
much
in
a
beer
and
you
dont
like
bud
or
coors
i
guess
check
it
out
d
definitely
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
it
is
a
definite
summer
beer
it
is
already
cooling
off
where
i
live
so
it
felt
a
bit
out
of
place
definitely
a
good
daytime
barbecue
or
picnic

with
a
lot
of
suspended
yeast
foamy

head

of

zest
and
spice
grains
of
paradise
taste
is
lemony
and
fairly
refreshing
squeaky
clean
on
the
finish
drinkability
is
decent
i
think
this
beer
like
most
summer
beers
is
good
on
a
hot
day
but
unremarkable
i
poured
a
cold
bottle
into
a
tall
cyclindrical
glass
for
this
tasting
this
seasonal
brew
is
a
fine
summer
compliment
to
the
other
sam
adams
offerings
i
need
to
research
this
grain
of
paradise
in
more
depth
d
seriously
how
can
you
not
like
this
beer
i
dont
understand
the
b
rating
at
all
this
would
be
very
refreshing
on
a
nice
hot
day
d
extremely
drinkable
on
e
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
beers
d
drinkability
is
light
refreshing
and
crisp
good
enjoyability
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
hazy
dirty
golden
color
with
a
moderate
sized
offwhite
head
aroma
is
rather
fresh
with
some
citrus
zing
to
it
this
has
a
lemon
citrusy
wheaty
flavor
with
mild
spices
nice
and
refreshing
nothing
too
complex
but
this
really
does
work
for
the
summer
good
patio
beer
and
a
nice
seasonal
offering
from
sam
adams
d
very
good
brew
to
enjoy
with
friends
and
a
summer
evening
i
could
go
for
another
right
now
in
fact
drinkability
very
good
highly
drinkable
this
would
be
perfect
for
a
bbq
cutting
the
grass
or
just
because
drinkability
everything
about
this
beer
says
subtle
but
definitely
not
simple
everything
in
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
no
one
ingredient
really
stands
out
but
together
they
make
the
beer
as
a
whole
stand
out
appearance
is
cloudy
yellowgold
with
an
offwhite
head
decent
lacing
hmm
i
definately
see
some
floaties
about
the
size
of
pepper
grains
there
are
some
weird
aromas
going
on
here
too
i
smell
some
faint
lemon
floral
hops
and
cereal
grains
all
ok
but
theres
an
odd
aroma
of
like
saran
wrap
or
something
artificial
that
doesnt
belong
there
flavor
is
similar
to
aroma
including
the
weird
saran
wrap
thing
medium
to
medium
low
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
strong
flavors
of
lemon
abound
that
renders
this
a
rather
tart
if
not
almost
sour
brew
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
for
an
american
wheat
i
like
sam
adams
but
this
beer
had
some
issues
medium
mouth
feel
maybe
more
creamy
than
crisp
carbonation
not
lively

be
crisp

smooth

give
this

summer
i
rated
this
beer
the
way
i
did
because
compared
to
other
summer
ales
this
one
is
not
balanced
enough
it
is
not
refreshing
clean
and
really
does
not
have
any
summer
aspects
in
it
d
i
could
drink
these
all
day
long
especially
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
in
the
summer
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
bold
and
flavorful
drinkability
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
there
is
a
reason
this
beer
is
so
popular
in
the
summertime
it
may
not
have
the
great
taste
profile
of
some
wheat
beers
but
it
has
a
strong
taste
and
is
drinkable
enough
to
drink
all
day
long
in
the
heat
great
summer
beer
solid
drinkability
for
setting
unos
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
given
this
as
only
choice
is
a
decent
option
this
is
an
okay
american
pale
wheat
ale
but
i
feel
it
isnt
as
refreshing
as
the
other
ones
out
there
which
makes
it
a
notsogreat
summer
beer
the
flavor
just
seems
a
little
tart
and
harsh
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
good
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
with
good
proportioning
and
flavors
that
compliment
eachother
well
cheers

great
light
crisp
beer
easy
to

d
this
isnt
the
best
summer
wheat
ale
out
there
but
sometimes
in
restaurants
you
have
to
pick
the
beer
that
is
the
least
bad
all
in
all
a
fine
beer
for
summer
swilling
the
summer
ale
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
with
a
good
2
finger
foam
head
with
minimal
retention
the
aroma
is
unique
with
the
stated
grains
of
paradise
used
it
has
a
good
wheat
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
clean
and
the
malt
slathers
the
tongue
and
the
second
half
is
the
lemony
spice
flavor
it
is
highly
carbonated
as
the
massive
amounts
of
little
bubbles
rush
to
the
top
it
is
a
pretty
darn
good
summer
time
session
beer
d
scores
well
here
this
is
typical
massproduced
sam
adams
offering
solid
and
consistent
but
not
great
im
always
happy
to
get
a
sixer
of
this
on
sale
and
enjoy
it
without
thinking
too
hard
about
it
decent
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
tart
aftertaste
i
know
that
this
is
the
drinkable
summer
beer
but
im
not
digging
it
that
much
for
body
you
could
knock
these
back
on
a
hot
day
i
just
dont
like
the
taste
enough
may
not
be
a
thick
beer
lovers
beer
but
i
think
it
does
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
do
i
would
love
to
leisurely
sit
back
and
have
this
whole
twelve
back
over
the
course
of
an
entire
day
and
i
probably
will
drinkability
wow
these
are
easy
to
drink
not
very
filling
has
a
good
taste
but
isnt
too
full
bodied
to
make
you
want
to
not
have
another
i
have
never
really
been
a
big
sam
adams
fan
and
i
will
never
forgive
them
for
the
bullet
aimed
at
all
humanity
known
as
cherry
wheat
this
beer
isnt
nearly
that
bad
but
it
does
remind
me
a
bit
of
acc
footballhovering
somewhere
around
mediocrity
never
really
breaking
out
of
it
but
not
quite
sinking
below
it
either
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
light
golden
color
with
a
heat
about
the
size
of
ally
mcbeal
and
retains
nothing
while
the
bubbles
lethargically
fondle
themselves
in
the
corner
the
beer
tastes
to
me
like
a
lager
with
some
wheat
and
lemon
thrown
in
and
im
pretty
sure
thats
about
all
there
is
you
can
quaff
it
on
a
summer
day
sure
but
any
wheat
beer
in
hot
temperatures
probably
isnt
the
best
idea
in
the
first
place
and
i
would
rather
spend
less
money
on
coronas
and
lime
still
its
not
a
disaster
if
youve
already
grabbed
a
sixer
just
surreptitiously
pawn
it
off
to
your
peripheral
friends
and
hope
to
get
something
better
from
them
at
a
later
time
i
love
this
beer
started
with
an
average
sized
frothy
white
and
mostly
diminishing
head
the
body
hue
was
medium
yellowlight
orange
with
tiny
particles
averagely
dispersed
the
aroma
was
a
nice
heavy
dough
with
moderate
malts
and
light
hops
the
flavor
was
definately
sweet
that
calms
down
until
a
nice
average
bready
finish
the
body
was
medium
to
full
dry
and
softly
carbonated
i
really
love
this
beer
and
is
in
my
top
5
of
favorite
beers
right
now
d
solid
but
forgettable
summer
ale
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
should
also
mention
that
it
hit
something
like
106
degrees
today
in
dallas
so
if
there
ever
was
a
perfect
day
for
a
beer
like
this
today
is
it
it
came
as
part
of
a
mixed
case
from
sams
club
so
you
never
know
how
fresh
it
is
didnt
think
to
check
for
a
born
on
date
before
tossing
the
bottle
it
poured
a
light
golden
nice
head
that
stood
up
for
a
few
minutes
before
dissipating
took
a
big
sniff
very
pleasant
fruitiness
lemon
big
expectations
for
a
beer
that
will
fight
off
this
oppressive
heat
no
bitterness
at
all
but
wasnt
expecting
any
and
true
to
style
very
refreshing
despite
the
very
light
quality
to
it
there
is
a
discernable
maltiness
well
balanced
for
its
type
i
had
mine
with
a
lightly
seasoned
grilled
chicken
and
it
was
a
very
nice
companion
i
recommend
this
beer
for
hot
days
or
for
a
session
beer
although
my
case
only
came
with
four
cheers
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
questionable
establishment
im
tempted
to
pick
up
a
sixer
to
compare
yet
im
also
cautious
to
not
waste
more
money
on
this
beer
the
aroma
was
mild
and
pleasant
the
beer
poured
a
strange
orangepeach
color
with
minimal
head
it
just
looked
fake
in
the
glass
not
offensive
just
odd
to
put
it
best
as
i
sipped
on
this
beer
i
was
able
to
detect
the
wheat
influence
there
is
a
spicy
taste
that
compliments
the
wheat
but
im
not
sure
if
i
like
it
other
than
those
two
aspects
the
overall
flavor
was
borderline
bland
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
pleasant
and
the
finish
is
relatively
smooth
overall
im
hoping
this
beer
is
better
than
what
was
poured
from
the
tap
revisit
as
promised
well
its
july
and
my
friend
brought
over
a
12
pack
of
this
for
dinner
the
other
night
having
this
fresh
from
the
bottle
and
drunk
from
a
nice
clean
glass
my
opinion
has
slightly
changed
for
the
better
looks
better
feels
better
and
tastes
much
better
still
a
tad
weak
in
my
opinion
but
it
is
more
crisp
and
inviting
this
time
around
the
flavor
needs
a
boost
to
really
let
this
one
soar
decent
summer
time
beer
for
some
reason
i
guess
i
expected
this
beer
to
really
have
some
zing
to
it
other
reviews
have
hit
accurately
on
its
qualities
wheaty
and
a
little
grassy
smelling
slightly
cloudy
gold
light
wheat
ale
flavor
anyway
its
very
underwhelming
for
me
maybe
its
because
this
tastes
exactly
like
the
cherry
wheat
which
i
had
to
endure
six
of
except
with
lemon
replacing
the
cherry
another
bland
pale
wheat
ale
offering
from
sam
adams
d
notes
this
is
a
fine
beer
to
relax
with
on
a
nice
summer
day
i
imagine
a
good
beer
for
cooking
with
as
well
smell
sweet
and
lemony
tasted
very
crisp
slightly
spicing
and
slight
hop
taste
very
smooth
and
a
very
drinalble
summer
beer
a
nice
one
to
have
in
the
fridge
on
those
110
degree
arizona
summer
afternoons
overall
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
special
i
prefer
the
southern
tier
awa
or
bells
awa
over
this
one
for
sure
they
both
carry
more
hops
still
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
refreshing
in
the
summer
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
good
amount
of
flavor
not
much
else
to
say
there
are
way
better
offerings
from
boston
brewing
a
refreshing
and
interesting
summer
take
for
sure
i
guess
its
a
fair
summer
ale
nothing
special
and
a
little
too
light
with
very
little
flavor
this
pours
pretty
clear
with
a
nice
head
smells
of
lemon
a
tad
bit
of
malts
and
hops
as
well
not
too
much
going
on
tastes
kind
of
bland
a
little
citrus
followed
by
some
hop
bitterness
and
finally
a
huge
hit
of
wheat
overall
this
was
a
decent
summer
beer
i
prefer
something
with
a
tad
bit
more
taste
and
balance
but
this
was
very
drinkable
and
extremely
refreshing
great
summer
beer
drinkability
a
fine
refreshing
summertime
offering
samuel
adams
summer
ale
walks
the
fine
line
between
delivering
the
goods
on
flavor
and
being
super
easy
to
gulp
down
i
see
it
the
yellow
label
grabs
me
and
says
drink
me
its
summer
but
i
just
cant
be
very
excited
once
ive
tried
it
its
mainstream
which
isnt
in
itself
a
bad
thing
but
it
could
be
more
still
it
drinks
quite
easily
the
issue
is
with
so
many
things
out
there
will
i
grab
another
one
so
ive
tried
it
and
ill
finish
the
six
but
thats
likely
the
end
of
this
little
tryst
d
nothing
special
at
all
if
your
looking
to
put
down
a
fair
amount
and
not
know
it
much
less
taste
this
is
your
backyard
hot
beer
a
great
session
beer
because
i
could
down
a
sixer
and
go
back
to
work
and
not
even
know
i
drank
that
much
one
of
the
mildest
sam
creations
i
have
quaffed
hey
what
a
delight
i
finally
tried
this
summer
brew
not
knowing
anything
about
it
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
indeed
i
was
happy
to
find
that
sam
adams
strayed
from
the
common
banana
or
orangeinfused
summer
wheats
the
lemon
zest
and
grains
of
paradise
do
a
great
job
relaying
that
summer
feel
in
an
original
way
smelled
good
tasted
good
and
was
very
drinkable
not
to
mention
affordable
d
easy
to
put
these
down
and
a
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
i
had
a
troegs
hop
back
right
after
it
not
a
good
idea
the
flavors
really
collided
ive
been
working
my
way
through
various
summer
beers
most
of
them
being
some
variation
of
an
american
lager
which
is
not
my
favorite
i
usually
end
up
disappointed
not
the
case
with
sams
summer
it
pours
a
hazy
yellow
not
as
cloudy
as
the
spring
white
if
your
familiar
with
sams
spring
offering
there
was
a
two
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
thin
lace
the
taste
is
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
one
beer
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
there
is
a
taste
possibly
the
lemon
zest
that
i
can
quite
place
but
makes
the
beer
very
appealing
d
better
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
than
a
night
slaving
in
front
of
the
computer
but
it
was
here
and
it
was
cold
on
tap
poured
into
tall
narrow
glass
tappered
at
top
and
bottom
hazy
body
creamy
head
smells
of
lemony
zest
citrus
and
spice
tastes
as
it
smells
but
was
expecting
a
little
more
substantial
flavor
finishes
quickly
and
dry
nicely
carbed
with
a
creamygrainy
sensation
drinkable
enough
not
very
strong
but
the
spice
seemed
to
tickle
my
noise
i
might
be
allergic
to
their
grains
of
paradise
or
it
could
have
been
something
i
ate
and
i
was
left
wanting
more
just
not
necessarily
another
one
of
these
d
sessionable
for
sure
this
is
a
light
bodied
refreshing
and
uniquely
flavorful
brew
that
deviates
from
the
norm
in
their
use
of
ingredients
nice
job
and
excellent
execution
again
a
great
beer
that
i
like
to
drink
but
i
consider
this
way
out
of
style
drinkability
is
moderate
decent
flavor
and
low
alcohol
make
the
beer
sessionable
however
it
is
a
bit
boring
d
great
beer
for
the
summer
nice
balance
not
too
sweet
what
a
summer
seasonal
should
be
if
you
want
a
nice
drink
that
is
light
at
flavorfull
sam
adams
summer
ale
is
just
what
you
need
on
this
very
hot
and
muggy
july
day
in
georgia
they
seem
to
slide
down
pretty
easy
once
you
get
past
the
initial
taste
surprise
still
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
more
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
medium
foam
head
on
an
only
slightly
cloudy
body
smell
of
citrus
was
immediate
with
wheatness
a
distinct
second
something
else
in
there
too
something
not
so
good
which
came
through
in
the
taste
dusty
or
moldy
maybe
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
or
something
but
that
taste
was
certainly
unappealing
the
citrus
flavor
was
just
about
right
but
the
wheat
was
lost
amid
the
lemon
and
dust
also
not
as
thick
as
other
wheats
not
too
special
and
certainly
not
among
the
best
d
nice
and
refreshing
with
a
light
body
i
just
got
in
from
working
outside
for
about
three
hours
and
felt
that
this
was
the
best
choice
definitely
a
good
lawnmower
beer
i
might
find
myself
kicking
back
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
night
outside
nicely
balanced
and
clean
i
wish
bartenders
would
stop
putting
lemon
on
the
rim
when
this
is
ordered
ask
first
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
it
had
some
head
when
i
poured
it
but
it
quickly
disappeared
you
can
smell
some
spices
and
a
subtle
hop
aroma
it
tastes
very
smooth
and
light
on
the
palate
with
a
soft
bitterness
in
the
end
i
could
also
taste
a
slight
citrus
flavor
its
a
good
summer
beer
very
drinkable
as
my
roommate
and
i
finished
a
six
pack
very
quickly
beer
is
colored
in
a
hazed
golden
hew
smell
shows
hops
but
also
a
little
spice
as
well
the
taste
is
smooth
with
lite
hops
and
easily
drinkable
goes
down
easy
with
a
very
littly
bitter
aftertaste
summer
ale
is
a
staple
of
summer
drinking
and
for
good
reason
its
light
hop
aroma
and
simple
mouthfeel
make
it
a
good
session
beer
for
the
summer
got
this
in
the
sam
adams
summer
variety
pack
this
beer
pours
deep
gold
in
color
with
light
head
it
smells
of
citrus
lemon
and
i
got
honey
as
well
the
taste
is
crisp
with
hints
of
lemon
and
orange
and
a
sweet
after
taste
its
a
smooth
beer
and
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
warm
evening
i
would
enjoy
this
again
although
next
time
i
would
like
it
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
on
a
hot
day
instead
of
the
evening
overall
a
decently
drinkable
pale
ale
with
a
bit
of
a
twist
i
liked
it
and
i
have
never
before
liked
a
wheat
beer
fantastically
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
whilst
barbecuing
massive
amounts
of
food
certainly
not
a
complaint
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
will
get
you
hammered
this
isnt
it
sits
too
heavy
on
the
stomach
for
me
at
least
to
drink
massive
quantities
pours
gold
with
a
medium
sized
head
maybe
a
bit
small
for
a
wheat
beer
nice
lacing
though
a
bit
hazy
but
mostly
clear
very
light
aroma
somewhat
yeasty
perhaps
some
light
fruit
notes
taste
is
sweet
but
not
too
much
so
with
a
bit
of
wheat
tang
and
lemon
notes
some
spiciness
in
the
finish
little
to
no
bitterness
medium
bodied
not
as
much
carbonation
as
some
wheat
beers
but
enough
very
drinkable
on
a
summer
day
maybe
a
little
subdued
but
pleasant
overall
light
to
mid
body
good
carbonation
drinks
nice
i
could
drink
many
laying
in
the
sun
good
summer
beer
im
afraid
this
one
just
does
not
agree
with
me
maybe
its
just
me
but
the
lemoncitrus
taste
is
gnarly
gave
me
a
rotten
case
of
heartburn
which
ive
never
gotten
from
any
other
beer
even
from
adding
real
lemon
or
lime
to
mexican
beers
to
me
doesnt
compare
well
to
the
other
sam
adams
brews
ive
sampled
would
not
buy
again
tastes
lemony
upfront
finishes
bitter
and
sour
maybe
too
sour
in
the
aftertaste
but
very
refreshing
and
nice
and
drinkable
d
definitely
drinkable
great
beer
for
the
summer
i
could
definitely
put
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
purchased
in
the
standard
samuel
adams
bottle
poured
to
a
goblet
mediumgolden
color
and
minimal
head
extreme
aroma
of
lemon
the
lemon
smell
really
came
through
with
this
beer
and
it
was
exceptional
it
felt
wonderful
around
the
mouth
and
went
down
extremely
smooth
it
was
extremely
lightbodied
and
reminded
me
of
a
good
pinot
grigio
definitely
something
i
could
drink
regularly
and
something
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
wanting
something
easy
to
find
cheap
and
very
good
d
nice
on
a
hot
day
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
one
finer
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
spidery
lacing
aromas
of
lemon
wheat
and
some
tropical
fruit
up
front
flavor
of
tropical
fruit
and
wheat
with
some
lemon
rind
bitterness
and
a
slightly
skunky
aftertaste
light
body
medium
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
flavor
is
better
than
the
aroma
but
not
a
whole
lot
pale
malts
and
wheat
with
above
lemon
and
a
background
spice
that
reminds
me
of
earthy
hops
but
not
really
hops
if
that
make
sense
body
is
creamy
lite
medium
and
carbonation
is
fairly
soft
drinkablity
is
fairly
high
but
i
probably
wont
ever
buy
it
again
had
on
tap
at
judies
restaurant
in
amherst
good
appearance
murky
yellow
with
some
lacing
and
a
decent
sized
head
its
aromas
were
strong
with
lemon
and
citrus
also
a
noticeable
grainy
aspect
to
the
smells
taste
included
those
hinted
flavors
but
lacked
the
sort
of
breadyness
i
thought
it
would
have
still
pretty
sour
and
sweet
mouthfeel
was
average
giving
it
a
medium
crispness
that
is
not
too
harsh
for
summer
days
overall
it
was
pretty
good
md
chewy
and
a
touch
astringetnt
a
decent
summer
wheat
but
not
my
first
choice
overall
a
nice
light
refreshing
summer
beer
drinkability
is
moderate
great
spice
and
flavor
profile
unique
can
be
a
bit
biting
for
drinking
in
larger
quantities
refreshing
ale
that
surprised
me
as
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
d
good
for
a
one
time
try
but
i
doubt
id
purchase
again
overall
an
easy
drinking
wheat
without
alot
of
character
is
a
great
thirst
quencher
deasy
to
drink
but
lacks
a
little
flavor
d
ill
pass
on
this
again
latest
of
the
sam
adams
seasonals
so
lets
see
how
this
does
on
a
hot
summer
night
color
is
a
hazy
gold
with
a
ever
so
slight
orange
tint
to
it
head
did
foam
up
to
a
nice
puffy
white
two
finger
length
smells
kind
of
grainy
with
a
lemon
tang
to
it
can
smell
some
hops
and
malt
floating
around
as
well
taste
is
of
a
bitter
lemon
hop
with
a
fading
malt
in
the
back
to
attempt
to
even
it
out
it
doesnt
work
so
well
some
sort
of
funk
in
the
smell
and
taste
that
just
turns
me
off
on
this
brew
very
drinkable
but
the
carbonation
may
get
to
you
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
duh
it
says
so
right
on
the
label
and
it
would
also
serve
as
a
good
crossover
as
well
d
not
sessionable
feels
smooth
crisp
and
full
without
feeling
like
a
burden
perfect
feel
for
a
summer
brew
and
combined
with
its
good
crisp
flavor
it
will
make
plenty
of
visits
to
my
fridge
i
got
no
qualms
with
this
one
sure
there
are
better
summertime
patio
beers
but
in
a
crunch
this
will
do
just
fine
in
fact
i
can
see
this
being
enjoyed
by
the
more
casual
crowd
of
beer
drinkers
as
well
as
the
more
demanding
aficionados
indeed
come
summer
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
refreshing
endlessly
quaffable
ale
one
wishes
were
more
widely
available
drinkability
yes
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
no
i
do
not
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
sam
adams
summer
ale
you
get
a

nevermind
the
other
wise
man
present
likes
it
more
sam
adams
summer
ale
you
get
a
4
d
nice
summer
offering
id
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
to
visit
this
again
however
this
is
not
your
typical
wheat
beer
a
good
lookin
average
beer
lightbodied
started
sweet
and
sharp
with
a
slight
bitterness
at
the
end
very
smooth
and
goes
well
with
summer
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
while
not
a
flavor
bomb
this
is
a
refreshing
take
on
a
muchmaligned
style
it
would
make
an
excellent
lawnmower
beer
and
hit
the
spot
on
what
is
the
warmest
day
thus
far
this
year
d
brewed
for
session
drinking
so
far
the
best
of
the
sa
summer
styles
different
which
is
nice
wouldnt
buy
again
i
had
this
back
to
back
with
a
corona
and
the
corona
kicked
sam
summers
ass
totally
unexpected
im
a
boston
beer
company
fan
but
their
summer
ale
misses
the
mark
doesnt
satisfy
they
should
take
this
one
out
of
their
rotation
and
push
their
much
better
white
ale
more
strongly
in
the
market
md
light
bodied
beer
the
agressive
carbonation
makes
it
a
bit
sharp
on
the
palate
i
think
there
is
too
much
lemon
in
this
but
this
beer
was
one
of
the
first
to
turn
me
on
to
the
craft
beer
scene
so
i
search
it
out
every
year
i
really
enjoy
summer
ale
not
the
best
of
the
style
but
at
5
2
abv
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
out
at
the
bbq
skal
overall
this
brew
was
just
way
too
tangy
i
just
felt
like
i
was
sucking
on
a
lemon
the
whole
time
last
years
batch
was
way
different
note
6
hours
have
passed
and
i
still
cant
shake
the
tangyness
from
my
palate
2weeks
later
shared
6
pack
with
a
freind
at
the
beach
but
very
drinkable
in
the
summer
heat
bottle
poured
a
clear
golden
color
ale
with
a
light
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
light
wheat
with
some
grain
of
paradise
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
grains
of
paradise
with
some
very
light
wheat
taste
is
very
dry
with
the
spices
also
coming
through
light
body
with
average
carbonation
malt
base
is
just
too
light
for
this
beer
to
be
truly
interesting
while
writing
this
review
in
december
of
a
summer
ale
among
other
spices
but
just
wasnt
into
it
at
the
end
i
had
no
problem
finishing
this
but
nothing
too
heavy
genogjun

looked
a
rich
golden
yellow
with
just
under
two
fingers
of
white
head
which
faded
and
did
leave
some
lacing
on
glass
didnt
get
too
much
as
far
as
the
smell
goes
but
did
have
a
slightly
sweet
odor
tastes
of
refreshing
wheat
and
had
a
kind
of
crisp
taste
to
it

great

certainly
one
that

i
just
thought
it
was
far
too
libght
and
really
just
a
touch
too
bland
for
my
tastes
a
nice
beer
for
tailgating
through
and
in
the
more
popular
establishments
thirst
quenching
brew
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down

would
have
improved
this
beer
considerably
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
with
citrus
and

very
light
in
the
body

d
a
crisp
carbonation
with
some
noble
hops
arriving
with
warming
delicate
and
spicy
in
flavor
md
crisp
yet
grainy
mouthfeel
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
light
body
and
a
lingering
dry
finish
it
fits
well
with
the
beer
this
beers
forced
flavor
keeps
it
from
being
highly
drinkable
but
it
is
very
crisp
and
decently
refreshing
i
can
think
of
many
other
lighter
beers
id
much
rather
drink
in
the
summer
though
im
one
of
these
funny
people
who
cant
find
much
to
like
about
sam
adams
but
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
offering
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
d
i
found
this
brew
to
be
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
its
pretty
good
d
overall
this
one
didnt
really
impress
me
there
are
so
many
better
wheat
beers
out
there
than
this
one
either
way
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
to
see
this
coming
from
sam
adams
i
expected
better
d
this
is
a
very
good
summer
ale
the
carbonation
makes
this
beer
very
refreshing
and
it
is
very
drinkable
in
hot
weather
situations
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
short
but
medium
bodied
white
head
that
fades
pretty
fast
and
settles
as
a
film
on
top
of
the
glass
it
laces
very
nicely
on
the
way
down
it
has
an
aroma
of
very
sweet
wheat
malt
a
tiny
bit
of
citrisy
hops
and
a
nice
citrisy
aroma
to
it
the
taste
delivers
as
well
it
has
a
very
nice
sweet
wheat
base
that
is
pretty
easy
to
detect
from
underneath
a
mix
of
lemony
and
orangy
flavors
but
finishes
with
a
clean
citrisy
hop
bitterness
that
is
not
overwhelming
but
very
complementing
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
crisp
and
refreshing
which
made
it
very
drinkable
i
will
stock
up
on
this
beer
at
the
end
of
the
summer
because
it
is
very
light
and
drinkable
beer
d
good
for
summer
swilling
easy
to
get
down
just
lacking
a
bit
in
the
nose
16
oz
on
tap
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
thin
film
of
head
aroma
skunk
initial
flavor
was
sweet
and
citrusy
flavor
ends
more
balanced
and
with
some
spice
light
to
medium
body
light
carbonation
limited
lacing
and
no
hint
of
alcohol
noted
i
have
had
this
before
and
i
have
enjoyed
it
before
but
for
me
and
my
buddy
this
was
the
worst
summer
ale
experience
we
had
have
yet
drinkability
is
fine
this
is
a
low
abv
and
nonoffensive
offering
from
boston
brewing
in
my
mind
simply
not
one
of
their
better
efforts
for
those
looking
for
a
summer
beer
there
are
better
out
there
uber
sun
or
dreamweaver
wheat
are
vastly
superior
slightly
fizzy
feel
in
the
belgian
way
though
clearly
not
a
belgian
medium
body
its
a
nice
summer
beer
that
isnt
for
weaklings
has
good
body
for
being
a
blatant
summer
brew
last
year
this
was
my
beer
candy
i
was
just
getting
into
craft
beers
and
i
thought
this
was
amazing
and
completely
unique
since
then
ive
expanded
my
knowledge
a
great
deal
and
i
didnt
expect
to
give
it
a
ovely
high
rating
but
it
lived
up
to
my
recollection
of
it
to
a
point
with
only
a
few
flaws
if
anything
i
do
remember
all
the
flavors
mixing
together
just
a
little
better
but
i
still
think
its
a
pretty
good
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
lace
on
the
glass
its
aroma
is
has
hints
of
wheat
citrus
fruit
and
some
spicy
notes
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
delicate
wheat
malts
and
a
zesty
kick
from
the
grains
of
paradise
and
lemon
the
hops
are
very
low
key
here
and
only
add
some
light
bitterness
to
the
finish
which
is
crisp
and
refreshing
d
a
decent
beer
i
was
expecting
an
attempt
at
a
hefeweizen
like
other
makers
try
to
do
with
the
style
actually
this
beer
is
unique
and
easily
distinguishable
from
a
hefe
good
job
sam
adams
probably
wont
have
again
though
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
good
beer
nonetheless
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
smell
of
wheat
and
yeast
and
spice
wheat
malts
up
front
then
some
lemon
comes
through
then
the
spice
hits
making
for
a
great
taste
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
crisp
and
good
carbonation
make
for
a
nice
summer
beer
that
can
be
drank
in
succession
d
a
very
drinkable
brew
nice
crisp
and
sharp
d
this
one
is
extremely
light
and
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
interested
not
a
bad
american
wheat
a
style
i
usually
hate
of
course
id
rather
take
a
german
hefe
over
this
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
d
very
smooth
and
very
little
aftertaste
this
beer
would
be
great
at
summer
bar
b
qs
i
guess
that
why
its
a
summer
ale
if
you
like
the
flavor
this
one
is
drinkable
i
just
cant
get
past
the
flavor
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
definitely
works
as
a
summer
brew
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
working
out
its
quaffable
but
that
seems
part
of
the
attraction
unfortunately
this
is
fine
but
not
one
to
blow
one
away
fine
on
a
hot
day
crisp
and
lively
slightly
dry
finish
is
perfect
for
summer
straw
gold
color
with
a
dense
cap
of
foam
that
quickly
disappeared
a
light
pale
malt
aroma
on
the
palate
slightly
chewy
perhaps
from
wheat
mostly
sweet
malt
flavors
until
it
pivots
into
a
nimble
finish
with
little
bitterness
easily
drinkable
and
a
good
session
beer
another
solid
brew
from
sam
adams
dvery
high
it
is
a
summer
beer
light
orange
colored
ale
with
a
aroma
of
wheat
and
lemony
citrus
taste
is
wheat
and
citrus
the
bottle
says
there
are
grains
of
paradise
in
it
i
dont
know
what
they
are
but
man
this
is
goodlike
most
of
their
beers
this
is
another
winner
highly
recommended
thsi
hazy
orange
brew
smells
of
wheat
and
spice
the
taste
is
smooth
and
light
its
not
a
flavorless
macro
lager
but
just
a
nice
easy
drinking
wheat
ale
with
a
spicy
lemony
finish
great
for
drinking
before
during
and
after
yard
work
d
drinks
great
and
is
quite
refreshing
in
the
heat
flavors
of
banana
sweet
wheat
very
mild
hopping
a
lemony
citrus
and
a
bit
of
spices
spices
seem
to
include
white
pepper
and
clove
finish
is
bready
with
yeast
all
in
all
this
is
a
drinkable
sixer
tho
not
one
i
would
rush
out
to
buy
again
the
upcoming
spring
summer
months
will
bring
many
choices
and
if
bbc
want
to
make
people
choose
theirs
somewhere
other
than
a
gas
station
or
supermarket
chain
theyll
need
to
step
up
their
game
a
little
that
extra
b
is
a
typo
good
drinkability
on
this
one
a
decent
beer
to
kick
back
with
on
a
summer
day
flavor
is
politely
tangy
with
a
rich
wheat
component
and
a
nice
buttery
mouthfeel
highlighted
by
a
mild
peppery
heat
from
the
featured
spices
grains
of
paradise
a
little
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
d
this
went
down
very
easy
and
reminded
me
of
how
much
i
used
to
enjoy
these
in
summers
past
great
session
beer
for
the
hot
days
ahead
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
fast
fading
head
and
minimal
lacing
smell
wheat
lemon
hint
of
spicy
hops
taste
sweet
malt
wheat
lemon
crisp
graininess
very
mild
floral
hop
presence
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
one
pretty
decent
light
bodied
tangy
crisp
and
fairly
refreshing
worth
a
try
notes
i
would
buy
this
again
and
i
intend
to
have
more
for
summer
not
the
bestbut
worthy
i
do
not
think
it
is
sam
adams
best
beerthey
can
do
better
this
batch
was
a
test
batch
and
reportedly
first
of
the
season
at
sam
so
it
wasnt
quite
the
same
as
stores
will
get
in
the
spring
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
to
have
as
its
sweet
crisp
and
light
while
offering
a
complexity
that
other
american
pale
wheats
of
summer
cant
compare
to
its
definitely
got
a
time
and
a
place
light
hazy
gold
pour
with
a
smallish
head
in
a
weizen
glass
smell
is
lightly
wheaty
a
bit
metallic
taste
is
a
nice
light
wheat
with
a
good
finish
wheaty
taste
up
front
is
milder
than
it
is
in
the
aftertaste
a
smooth
nice
example
of
an
american
wheat
beer
that
id
buy
again
d
while
nothing
about
this
beer
was
incredibly
good
or
bad
i
do
enjoy
drinking
this
well
in
the
summer
and
is
a
reliable
beer
at
a
chain
restaurant
in
the
summer
and
worth
picking
up
a
6
pack
for
an
outdoor
afternoon
very
drinkable
especially
at
a
ball
game
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
sam
does
a
great
job
of
a
summer
ale
a
light
golden
color
and
a
small
but
attractive
top
upon
first
taste
a
nice
light
and
refreshing
flavor
from
the
first
taste
you
must
continue
and
have
a
few
of
these
grab
a
burger
and
fries
with
sam
summer
and
you
will
be
living
the
good
life
the
bottom
line
a
fine
summer
offering
by
the
sam
adams
folks
assertively
malty
with
some
interesting
spice
depth
well
worth
checking
out
very
murky
medium
bodied
ale
citrus
spicy
smell
not
my
bag
anymore
medium
body
medium
effervescence
with
a
degree
of
crispness
taste
becomes
aftertaste
and
just
slowly
fades
away
with
an
excellent
balance
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
one
of
sams
finest
brews
pours
out
a
nice
light
slightly
orange
color
a
very
nice
summer
hue
has
an
excellent
crisp
and
light
smell
with
a
nice
wheat
aroma
and
hints
of
orange
a
very
nice
summery
taste
a
light
and
crisp
feel
with
a
good
wheat
flavor
with
excellent
hints
of
orange
and
some
slight
spiciness
goes
down
fairly
smooth
and
is
a
nice
drink
on
the
porch
at
the
end
of
a
summer
or
even
fall
day
tastes
of
lemon
with
hints
of
wheat
very
light
in
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
i
can
see
enjoying
these
in
the
blazing
summer
months
a
little
too
late
in
the
year
for
this
but
still
quite
pleasant
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
beer
is
far
to
thin
on
the
palate
sure
pale
wheats
are
supposed
to
be
thinner
but
this
is
too
much
so
and
its
got
carbonation
which
i
find
is
just
a
bit
too
much
making
the
thin
body
more
apparent
the
brew
has
a
fairly
dry
finish
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wont
buy
again
to
me
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
makes
it
superb
that
makes
it
really
stand
out
sure
the
grains
of
paradise
are
neat
but
the
body
is
lacking
and
there
are
many
that
are
much
better
and
there
are
also
those
that
are
much
better
that
are
just
as
uniquely
different
too
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
had
a
fairly
good
head
had
the
appearance
of
an
orange
drink
to
me
citrus
tones
covered
the
smell
the
taste
has
a
slight
lemon
aftertaste
and
a
piney
taste
as
well
might
be
a
tiny
hint
of
malt
overall
prett
good
lacing
in
the
glass
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
on
the
mouth
makes
this
offering
from
sam
adams
very
drinkable
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
means
try
it
its
a
competent
brew
poured
it
into
a
goblet
it
was
to
me
homebrewie
apricot
on
the
nose
fruity
sweetness
followed
by
grainy
bitterness
a
bigger
body
then
needed
for
a
summer
beer
however
the
grainy
sharpness
would
cut
thru
a
grilled
burger
and
i
would
drink
it
if
offered
can
drink
several
of
these
if
you
wanted
to
nothing
too
special
about
this
beer
just
your
typical
summer
ale
this
is
a
very
light
blonde
ale
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
nice
thin
head
that
doesnt
fade
away
too
quick
and
has
a
good
citrusy
aroma
to
it
it
has
some
good
spicy
flavors
in
it
nothing
too
strong
it
has
a
light
lemony
crispness
throughout
and
has
a
bit
of
bitterness
in
its
aftertaste
but
nothing
too
overwhelming
not
bad
over
all
sam
adams
summer
ale
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
thin
but
lingering
head
aroma
is
mostly
spices
with
a
light
malty
sweetness
flavor
is
crisp
not
sweet
but
not
dry
the
spices
come
through
but
not
overpowering
there
is
a
light
bitterness
but
no
real
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
i
gotta
give
sam
adams
credit
for
brewing
a
cloudy
wheat
beer
with
some
flavor
for
their
summer
beer
a
decent
change
from
a
lot
of
other
pale
wheat
beer
summer
beers
hazy
yellow
gold
smells
of
grainy
wheat
lemon
some
sweetness
and
that
sam
adams
aroma
you
know
what
im
talking
about
tangy
wheat
flavor
zesty
and
almost
berrylike
much
better
than
i
remembered
actually
lightish
body
pretty
clean
and
crisp
its
not
going
to
blow
anybody
away
but
its
a
solid
choice
for
a
hot
day
drinkability
a
very
light
drinkable
summer
beer
had
this
at
dinner
tonight
im
going
to
blame
the
lack
of
head
on
the
bartender
and
i
dont
think
i
got
the
best
pour
possible
little
bit
of
lace
but
not
much
nose
on
this
was
a
little
grassy
and
had
a
hint
of
toast
with
malts
but
not
very
strong
at
all
taste
was
very
good
with
the
maltytoasty
backbone
cut
by
the
hops
but
it
was
very
balanced
the
beer
was
carbonated
to
the
right
level
overall
i
thought
it
was
very
good
and
it
went
well
with
dinner
i
ordered
a
guinness
after
this
one
i
shouldve
stuck
with
this
as
it
was
much
better
than
the
guinness
d
a
pretty
easy
drinking
brew
light
and
refreshing
body
as
well
as
a
good
taste
makes
it
go
down
easy
mouthfeel
is
light
as
youd
probably
want
in
a
summer
beer
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
several
of
these
could
be
entertained
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
good
summer
heat
thirst
quencher
fresh
taste
without
too
much
body
goes
down
easily
did
i
get
a
bad
six
cause
god
damn
this
has
the
ingredients
of
the
beer
i
had
last
year
but
the
tannins
were
out
of
control
and
i
gagged
very
very
hard
on
this
beer
eric
a
yellow
golden
color
brew
with
a
thin
but
stubborn
head
and
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
yet
hints
at
a
biscuitmalt
blend
the
taste
reveals
a
bready
and
kind
of
woody
flavor
sort
of
dull
but
with
a
subtle
complexity
a
little
tart
from
tongue
to
throat
with
a
bitter
finish
pretty
thin
stuff
not
much
body
its
ok
fairly
drinkable
however
i
wouldnt
be
too
interested
in
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
given
some
choice
d
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
once
the
leaves
start
a
changin
this
will
probably
get
pushed
to
the
back
of
the
fridge
even
now
id
like
an
ale
of
this
style
which
emphasizes
something
besides
citrus
as
the
label
says
this
is
definitely
a
summer
beer
not
a
ton
of
personality
to
it
but
i
guess
i
really
didnt
expect
it
d
ok
for
summer
light
in
body
low
in
abv
and
pretty
creamy
makes
it
pretty
quaffable
the
beer
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
nice
white
head
quite
nice
aromas
of
citrus
and
bread
later
the
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
with
citrus
flavors
tangerine
and
a
slight
apple
in
the
finish
all
this
was
wrapped
up
in
a
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
quite
nice
easy
session
beer
but
is
very
lackluster
overall
i
have
heard
good
things
about
this
beer
but
wasnt
impressed
decent
body
and
carbonation
mouth
seems
a
bit
creamy
the
husky
element
hurts
the
drinkability
and
the
refreshing
character
of
the
beer
poured
with
vigor
into
sa
glass
overall
a
quick
read
of
the
bottle
sums
this
beer
up
quite
well
wheat
grains
of
paradise
lemon
all
the
flavors
are
easy
to
pick
out
and
strait
forward
simple
beer
that
some
may
say
leans
a
little
too
heavily
on
the
lemon
rind
though
i
can
no
longer
find
much
about
this
beer
to
inspire
me
to
drink
it
i
do
credit
it
as
one
of
if
not
the
first
beer
i
ever
liked
other
than
an
american
domestic
pils
way
back
my
sophmore
year
of
college
thanks
for
that
sa
served
on
tap
this
was
straw
in
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
to
it
smell
was
dominated
by
spice
which
i
thought
was
coriander
until
reading
the
blurb
here
bread
dough
and
zesty
citrusnot
the
usual
sweet
grapefruity
citrus
i
am
used
to
taste
was
a
light
sweetness
balanced
by
the
spiciness
that
dominated
this
beer
very
interesting
i
did
not
expect
this
out
of
a
summer
ale
mouthfeel
was
light
and
a
bit
puckering
decent
drinkability
the
spiciness
makes
it
kind
of
snappy
if
that
means
anything
i
didnt
like
this
beer
but
this
is
only
the
second
time
ive
been
disappointed
with
a
sam
adams
offering
so
i
really
hate
to
give
jim
a
bad
grade
cloudy
orangeyellow
color
minimal
head
light
citrusy
flavor
not
bad
but
nothing
special
poured
with
decent
head
that
did
not
stay
around
for
long
minimal
lacing
on
glass
fruity
taste
with
tangy
bite
i
thought
this
was
ok
but
not
great
sam
adams
best
efforts
are
with
their
dark
beers
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
went
away
quickly
in
the
nose
was
a
european
pilsner
hop
yet
very
small
and
some
sweetness
in
the
taste
i
get
a
sweet
lemon
presence
and
a
dry
finish
it
is
kind
of
sticky
yet
refreshing
easy
to
drink
a
decent
summer
ale
tastes
mildly
sweet
with
a
thick
nonflavor
umami
ie
protein
character
flavor
of
a
mealy
orange
could
be
from
the
hops
strong
fine
carbonation
fights
flavors
from
being
detected
by
the
tongue
and
keeps
the
sweet
from
hanging
during
the
swallow
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
a
little
bit
floral
from
the
hops
aftertaste
comes
across
as
musky
wheat
like
rye
without
the
zing
md
thick
body
seems
less
because
of
the
strong
carbonation
d
after
drinking
these
i
think
the
only
one
id
ever
want
to
pick
up
again
is
the
boston
lager
the
rest
are
nice
but
dont
seem
as
finished
to
me
all
good
or
average
but
not
great
ill
need
to
try
this
beer
again
it
may
be
possible
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
sam
could
do
such
a
poor
job
with
such
an
appealing
style
of
brew
recommended
great
crossover
beer
for
sure
pours
a
pale
gold
thats
actually
a
bit
translucentbut
not
cloudy
head
dies
quickly
to
a
thin
film
decent
lacing
smell
brings
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
taste
is
quite
nice
and
fresh
lemoncitrus
in
up
front
but
not
overpowering
and
the
malts
are
underneath
with
a
solid
backing
sweetness
not
too
much
not
too
little
nice
crisp
mouth
feel
with
medium
carbonation
but
its
actually
the
sweetness
that
seems
to
linger
a
tad
more
crispness
might
make
this
a
more
drinkable
summer
beer
but
a
good
choice
for
a
few
with
friends
after
work
in
baseball
terms
this
is
a
solid
base
hit
bordering
on
a
double
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
moderate
carbonation
a
good
cookout
beer
fairly
uneventful
but
of
high
quality
overall
a
decent
beer
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
on
my
first
bottle
the
lemon
zest
really
came
through
but
as
i
continued
drinking
the
taste
faded
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
something
ill
reach
for
again
nice
fresh
wheaty
base
with
surpisingly
dry
but
still
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
finish
slight
hoppiness
to
the
aftertaste
not
overly
special
but
still
a
decent
summer
selection
light
airy
texture
that
isnt
too
carbonated
a
good
choice
for
beach
or
barbecue
overall
summary
pretty
hearty
for
a
summer
beer
but
pretty
refreshing
too
after
my
initial
experiences
with
the
bottled
version
i
was
quite
pleased
to
find
out
my
local
red
robin
had
this
on
tap
the
server
brought
it
out
in
a
22oz
mug
color
was
clear
yellow
with
a
strong
if
somewhat
small
head
that
somehow
managed
to
last
the
entire
beer
scent
was
yeasty
citric
and
slightly
hoppy
with
just
a
hint
of
spiciness
underneath
taste
was
very
yeasty
much
more
so
than
the
bottled
version
with
a
bit
of
hops
just
a
hint
of
the
grains
of
paradise
and
a
nice
lemony
zest
serving
to
balance
everything
out
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
very
refreshing
drinkability
was
very
good
almost
deceptively
so
it
would
seem
that
i
need
to
start
trying
summer
ales
now
having
this
one
on
tap
sealed
the
deal
for
me
drinkability
i
wanted
to
give
this
2007
offering
a
try
as
a
possible
summer
beer
ive
been
partial
to
hefes
and
wanted
to
see
if
this
one
would
fit
the
bill
im
not
sure
so
far
im
having
to
go
with
the
harpoon
raspberry
ufo
for
this
year
pours
a
lighter
orange
color
with
good
head
but
little
retention
slightly
cloudy
appearance
to
it
hops
are
present
in
the
smell
along
with
some
sour
citrus
to
it
as
well
tastes
pretty
good
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
but
its
not
bad
just
like
the
smell
a
slight
hops
kick
to
it
and
the
citrus
is
definitely
present
in
the
taste
almost
slightly
sour
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
if
thats
possible
high
carbonation
and
a
very
crisp
taste
leaves
the
mouthfeel
light
and
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
would
recommend
this
much
more
than
there
hefe
for
a
sam
adams
summer
beer
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
large
and
fluffy
it
recedes
slowly
into
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
lemons
and
sweet
grass
the
taste
is
of
tangy
wheat
with
the
lemon
and
sweet
grass
coming
in
for
the
aftertaste
and
sticking
around
for
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
beer
after
it
has
been
sodomized
by
a
lemon
and
i
dont
like
wheat
beers
to
be
served
with
lemons
i
will
not
drink
this
again
oh
and
i
accidentally
had
to
much
of
this
wonderful
brew
so
i
had
to
leave
my
car
at
bdubs
thankfully
my
fiance
met
me
there
after
work
so
i
had
a
ride
home
damn
those
big
23
oz
glasses
quite
sessionable
this
is
an
excellent
summer
brew
that
for
me
personally
has
that
typical
sam
adams
character
i
poured
it
into
my
weizen
glass
and
it
was
a
cloudy
yellow
color
typical
of
many
wheat
beers
it
had
a
mild
hop
smell
with
a
stronger
lemoncitrus
smell
the
taste
was
really
smooth
and
the
citrus
flavor
was
pronounced
overall
a
good
refreshing
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
this
beer
but
i
can
drink
it
all
day
its
got
a
fairly
unique
and
refreshing
flavor
but
it
is
a
bit
unbalanced
the
wheat
flavor
is
pronounced
but
not
overwhelming
there
are
grassy
and
pine
hops
as
well
as
a
decent
amount
of
citrusy
sweetness
its
not
the
tastiest
beer
in
the
world
but
once
i
get
going
on
this
one
they
just
keep
going
down
the
hatch
a
great
summer
sessioner
light
bodied
and
carbonation
was
just
about
right
its
easy
to
drink
2
or
3
of
the
big
ones
at
the
local
bar
and
grill
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
one
but
i
dont
think
that
it
is
something
that
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future

my
notes

i
bought
a
case
not

long

and
it
is
almost
gone
i
will
probaly
wait
until
next
summer
to
try
it
again

hazy
dark

has
a
slight
head
on
it
with
a
minimal
amount
of
lacing
not
too
much
going
on
in
the
smell
department
some
slight
citrus
notes
but
thats
all
i
can
pick
up
taste
is
pretty
darn
good
it
doesnt
hurt
that
i
just
got
off
work
but
has
a
nice
unique
taste
to
it
not
like
other
summer
beers
ive
had
it
doesnt
have
the
boring
wheat
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
and
right
now
i
feel
like
i
can
drink
a
hundred
of
these
great
deal
as
usual
from
sam
adams
drinkability
nice
summer
beer
i
always
enjoy
the
seasonal
brews
from
sam
adams
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
id
put
away
a
couple
of
glasses
before
i
knew
it
and
i
easily
could
have
knocked
back
a
few
more
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
leaves
a
one
finger
head
with
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
quite
underwhelming
as
barely
a
hint
of
spice
is
noticed
the
taste
is
crisp
and
has
nice
hints
of
spice
and
malt
leading
to
a
dry
peanuty
aftertaste
the
beer
has
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
is
drinkable
perfectly
suited
for
this
time
of
the
year
is
it
the
best
ive
ever
had
no
the
worst
no
i
find
that
this
beer
is
in
the
middle
of
the
spectrum
for
me
i
would
buy
it
again
but
only
if
in
an
outdoor
setting
where
it
would
really
shine
d
the
light
body
which
is
somewhat
watery
makes
for
a
good
summer
beer
this
seems
like
itd
hit
the
spot
at
an
outside
bbq
party
as
its
not
too
over
the
top
and
is
quite
the
thirst
quencher
its
composition
makes
it
very
easy
to
drink
once
the
taste
for
the
brew
is
acquired
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
afternoon
in
the
yard
easily
drinkable
but
kind
of
boring
a
good
summer
backup
no
doubt
taste
and
aroma
very
nice
but
a
bit
fizzy
a
decent
sumer
brew
went
well
with
a
grilled
tuna
dinner
this
is
part
of
the
sam
adams
summer
pack
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
light
slighlty
hazy
gold
forming
a
very
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
very
light
spots
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
very
interesting
mix
of
wheat
malt
hops
and
spices
the
aroma
reminds
me
alot
of
the
holiday
releases
by
sam
adams
the
taste
is
a
nice
combination
of
wheat
followed
by
a
slight
lemon
flavor
and
finishing
with
the
spices
medium
mouthfeel
a
good
abv
and
smooth
finish
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
this
was
a
suprise
most
summertime
beers
tend
to
be
weak
and
very
lacking
in
the
flavoring
but
this
beer
proved
that
wrong
i
think
ill
be
having
several
of
these
throughout
the
summer
this
is
another
sa
that
i
really
enjoy
overall
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
i
really
enjoyed
it
d
very
drinkable
of
course
made
to
enjoy
several
cold
ones
on
a
dog
day
here
in
south
carolina
ill
reach
for
this
one
when
the
heat
index
hits
115
a
summer
ale
that
really
suits
summer
days
great
ale
sam
you
did
it
again
not
at
all
a
good
summer
beer
will
avoid
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
lemon
and
lightly
grassy
aroma
taste
is
a
mellow
lemonherbal
flavor
with
a
clean
bitterness
that
lingers
well
into
the
aftertaste
smooth
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
and
a
little
something
different
enjoyed
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
90f
afternoon
drinkability
perfect
for
a
nice
light
beer
that
wont
slow
you
down
also
great
as
an
introductory
beer
to
offer
the
bmc
crowd
to
entice
them
away
from
tasteless
beers
that
are
full
of
fillers

edition
12oz

poured

glass
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
features
malt
and
citrus
the
taste
is
more
malt
and
fruity
citrus
flavors
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
brew
to
down
in
the
hot
outdoors
but
it
is
does
not
possess
enough
character
to
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
a
very
good
summer
beer
and
i
have
notices
it
is
extreamly
unoffensive
to
a
non
beer
drinker
poors

that
dosent

oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
bright
golden
color
with
a
small
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
dissapears
aromas
are
of
very
sweet
citrus
and
some
malts
taste
is
a
big
dose
of
orange
some
wheat
and
some
unwanted
metallic
elements
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
wheat
beer
this
would
not
be
on
the
top
of
my
list
average
at
best
this
beer
is
decent
but
its
a
little
too
subdued
overall
another
good
one
from
sam
adams
nothing
that
will
set
the
world
on
fire
but
an
enjoyable
beer
nevertheless
worth
a
try
it
hazy
orange
in
color
with
a
pretty
good
head
it
glows
in
the
rather
dark
surroundings
of
roscoes
not
much
to
smell
but
yeast
perhaps
being
too
cold
the
first
half
of
the
beer
was
boring
because
it
was
too
cold
but
as
it
warmed
up
it
got
better
some
mango
apricot
yeast
pepper
and
spice
become
noticable
smooth
and
creamy
from
draft
it
must
be
more
refeshing
when
its
warm
because
i
consumed
this
after
midnight
when
its
you
know
cool
taste
is
awful
stale
hops
malt
citrus
nothing
fresh
or
refreshing
too
sweet
if
anything
this
must
have
been
a
keg
from
last
year
it
aint
good

head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
ok
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
an
inch
white
head
it
smells
like
lemon
grain
and
some
peppery
spicyness
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
it
smells
except
that
theres
a
slight
tangy
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
beer
is
smooth
drinkability
is
ok
its
easy
to
drink
its
a
good
choice
as
a
summer
beer
i
think
it
could
be
very
sessionable
on
a
hot
day
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
nonoffensive
brew
exceptional
drinkability
not
impressive
but
its
not
suposed
to
be
just
simple
and
good
pours
a
color
similar
to
apple
juice
bright
white
foamy
head
settles
fairly
quickly
moderate
carbonation
smells
very
similar
to
a
witbier
but
without
the
coriander
a
little
citrusy
odor
as
well
tastes
faintly
sweet
with
a
lemony
bitterness
and
a
faint
malty
sweet
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
to
me
seems
a
bit
syrupy
but
other
than
that
is
very
smooth
very
well
balanced
very
drinkable
easily
more
enjoyable
than
the
other
sam
adams
i
can
remember
trying
pours
a
cloudy
yellowishorange
with
a
white
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
smell
was
of
fresh
grain
lemon
and
some
spiciness
taste
was
great
some
of
the
wheat
phenols
and
a
burst
of
citrus
and
spiciness
again
mouthfeel
was
fairly
standard
for
a
witbier
a
little
creaminess
and
a
drying
at
the
end
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
when
it
is
served
chilled
light
and
refreshing
summer
ale


yeah
d
a
great
beer
for
your
tongue
to
traverse
and
discover
interesting
and
well
blended
flavors
certainly
one
i
would
enjoy
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
even
a
cool
spring
day
grains
of
paradise
what
are
they
i
dont
know
put
them
in
a
beer
and
the
results
are
amazing
each
and
every
year
i
wait
for
this
brew
each
and
every
year
it
is
somewhat
different
and
somehow
better
great
in
the
bottle
better
on
draft
excellent
choice
for
mowing
the
lawn
or
just
being
lazy
on
the
porch
it
pours
a
lovely
cloudy
honeygolden
with
a
nice
thick
head
aroma
is
somewhat
scanty
but
nice
and
malty
with
lemony
hints
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
with
citrus
overtones
as
well
as
hints
of
hops
and
wheat
laidback
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
warmweather

mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
nice
on
a
hot

very
drinkable
pretty
good
session
beer
overall
its
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
this
definetly
jumps
to
the
top
of
my
list
of
comfort
brews
even
above
sa
and
yunegling
lagers
and
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
makes
for
a
great
summer
outdoorgrilling
brew
and
is
extremely
findable
this
is
a
classic
brew
which
also
doubles
as
a
great
gateaway
brew
appearance
is
a
clear
gold
with
a
slight
head
that
fades
fast
smell
has
a
citurs
aroma
to
it
with
something
weird
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
i
think
it
is
strange
the
strange
smell
is
in
the
taste
but
so
is
a
good
wheat
flavor
also
some
orange
or
lemmon
flavor
maybe
this
beer
would
be
better
if
it
was
really
hot
out
all
in
all
ok
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
sa
offerings
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
looks
like
a
summer
ale
nose
is
slight
hops
and
slight
lemon
with
cereal
grains
taste
is
mild
corn
even
milder
hops
a
slightly
sweet
toffee
finish
and
hints
of
metal
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
average
overall
a
pleasant
but
forgetable
beer
d
a
fine
ale
indeed
crisp
and
clean
taste
yet
complex
enough
to
keep
you
interested
definitely
a
great
summertime
drink
samuel
adams
summer
ale
was
a
golden
orange
color
and
a
little
hazy
it
had
a
white
head
that
quickly
became
a
thin
layer
the
aroma
was
lemon
and
wheat
the
taste
was
lemon
as
well
with
a
touch
of
pepper
and
a
dry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
its
a
decent
beer
for
a
hot
day
but
not
something
i
would
want
very
often
d
light
body
relatively
low
abv
and
refreshing
taste
make
this
beer
good
for
an
afternoon
bbq
or
a
long
summer
night
session
beer
ontap
at
the
fox
and
the
hound
in
philly
cause
ive
tried
everything
else
there
pours
a
fairly
opaque
orangeyellow
color
with
a
nice
looking
head
nose
is
extremely
mild
and
straightforward
citrus
taste
is
similar
if
a
little
stronger
and
more
in
your
face
feel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
overall
its
an
alright
beer
but
theres
a
lot
better
by
sam
adams
and
a
lot
better
in
this
style
the
taste
this
time
was
very
wheaty
somewhat
harsh
like
i
find
other
sam
adams
beers
but
not
horrible
drinkabily
is
good
as
there
is
nothing
here
to
offend
maybe
the
best
american
wheat
beer
ive
had
theres
a
tinge
of
vanilla
and
hefeweizen
spice
to
it
along
with
mellow
wheat
and
malt
hops
are
present
though
only
an
afterthought
all
in
all
there
is
a
gentle
complexity
that
makes
this
a
good
beer
not
too
dumbed
down
like
most
light
wheat
beers
worth
a
try
d
great
sa
brew
great
summer
brew
very
sessionable
the
brew
pours
to
a
golden
color
maybe
a
pale
orange
with
a
slight
haze
has
a
nice
sized
white
head
that
has
great
retention
and
leaves
a
nice
amount
of
sticky
lace
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
enticing
nice
citrus
mostly
lemon
scents
slight
spice
and
malts
the
much
hyped
grains
of
paradise
which
just
seem
to
scream
drink
me
during
the
warm
months
the
malt
in
my
mind
seems
to
dominate
the
taste
with
grainy
flavor
little
toasted
notes
a
fair
zest
flavor
as
well
with
lemon
seeming
to
be
the
most
persistent
an
easy
drinking
brew
which
seems
to
go
well
while
just
kicking
back
enjoying
the
spring
and
summers
warm
months
if
you
want
a
high
quality
beer
go
somewhere
else
if
you
want
a
refreshing
are
you
sure
its
not
water
summer
beer
go
somewhere
else
either
way
go
somewhere
else
drinkability
as
stated
this
a
good
summer
ale
another
beer
part
of
the
sam
summer
pack
the
summer
ale
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
decent
frothy
head
overcarbonation
anyway
the
aroma
seems
light
and
crisp
with
spiciness
the
flavor
starts
out
malty
at
first
and
then
segues
into
what
appears
to
be
lemon
zest
and
the
spiciness
makes
itself
known
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
seems
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
i
think
it
is
definitely
a
good
beer
for
those
long
hot
days
of
summer
this
beer
pours
a
light
amber
yellow
with
head
that
does
not
lace
the
smell
is
a
little
sweet
and
citruslike
the
taste
is
clean
with
citrus
and
the
normal
wheat
malt
experience
the
beer
is
very
crisp
so
it
becomes
very
drinkable
and
very
sessionable
good
light
body
and
bright
and
zesty
flavor
was
surprised
to
even
see
this
at
my
local
beer
store
it
was
a
nice
change
from
the
boston
lager
nice
lemony
and
orangy
overtones
and
very
smooth
on
the
way
down
not
as
bitter
as
i
had
hoped
but
the
sudden
bite
of
zest
at
the
beginning
makes
up
for
the
lack
of
hoppiness
d
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
summer
sipper
not
a
big
fan
of
the
taste
though
there
is
a
faint
taste
of
detergent
here
or
some
other
lemon
cleaning
product
i
cant
detect
any
pleasant
flavors
even
though
the
carbonation
seems
about
right
the
beer
still
seems
flat
so
perhaps
it
needs
more
hops
or
perhaps
my
palate
and
this
beer
just
dont
agree
drank
the
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
from
the
bottle
it
was
something
that
i
would
drink
again
but
it
lacks
the
real
beer
flavor
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
sam
adams
it
is
watery
and
it
leaves
you
wanting
more
flavor
its
mouth
feel
is
alright
but
again
i
expected
it
to
be
better
overall
it
is
alright
but
if
i
am
really
hot
on
a
summer
day
i
might
grab
the
water
first
light
and
tangy
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
on
a
summer
dayrefreshing
and
enjoyable
enough
american
yeast
characteristics
clean
smooth
no
cloviness
light
on
the
spicieness
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
off
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
on
the
glass
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
smell
of
wheat
and
yeast
and
spice
wheat
malts
up
front
then
some
lemon
comes
through
then
the
spice
hits
making
for
a
great
taste
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
crisp
and
good
carbonation
make
for
a
nice
summer
beer
md
very
light
on
the
palate
making
it
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
think
it
would
pair
will
w
some
spicy
bbq
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
had
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
the
head
slowly
disapated
to
a
small
head
that
just
covers
the
surface
it
smells
of
wheat
with
strong
undertones
of
zesty
lemon
the
taste
comes
on
smooth
at
first
then
becomes
a
little
more
robust
as
soon
as
your
lips
come
off
the
glass
i
liked
the
flavors
of
citrus
and
wheat
the
grains
of
paradise
add
a
distict
zest
to
the
beer
which
makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
summer
beers
around
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
especially
in
the
warm
weather
a
good
beer
goes
down
easy
refreshing
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonals
as
its
not
too
thin
and
watery
but
it
also
quite
refreshing
and
distinct
ive
never
tasted
something
with
such
an
understated
beer
flavor
to
quickly
explain
my
rankings
the
appearance
is
nothing
special
and
the
aroma
is
very
unusual
ive
found
a
lot
of
american
hefeweizens
to
be
really
thin
and
watery
and
this
is
just
not
that
at
all
its
a
full
bodied
ale
that
calls
your
attention
and
doesnt
let
go
and
i
had
a
4
for
drinkability
but
when
i
didnt
get
through
smell
without
finishing
the
first
12oz
bottle
it
would
be
a
5
for
drinkability
but
the
unique
factor
has
a
tendency
to
inch
its
way
towards
cloying
after
a
couple
bottom
line
perfect
six
pack
with
a
partner
or
a
32oz
bottle
to
oneself
i
think
thats
what
they
come
in
are
those
40s
on
a
hot
summer
night
when
others
just
cant
quench
poured
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
hint
of
orange
nice
soapy
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
cap
the
smell
is
not
very
present
maybe
a
hint
of
lemon
and
a
metallic
twang
it
has
an
american
wheat
base
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
slight
funk
taste
nothing
fantastic
but
at
least
the
hint
of
lemon
is
subtle
the
feel
is
a
bit
too
fizzy
and
leaves
a
dry
aftertaste
this
is
a
refreshing
summer
ale
but
does
not
stand
out
drinks
easy
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
i
remembered
this
beer
having
a
lot
more
flavor
last
year
its
probably
just
that
my
tastes
have
changed
but
its
still
an
easydrinking
and
enjoyable
summer
beer
overall
i
think
this
is
not
a
bad
summertime
beer
a
spiced
up
version
of
some
of
the
other
american
wheat
ales
not
all
that
impressive
its
just
not
that
flavorful
its
probably
sam
adams
weakest
seasonal
imo
still
its
not
bad
i
suppose
its
a
good
choice
for
summer
due
to
its
light
body
and
taste
im
sure
its
a
good
thirst
quencher
quite
average
better
than
most
macro
beers
but
compared
to
most
spiced
wheat
beers
this
one
is
a
disappointment
on
tap
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
racing
up
the
beer
no
head
to
speak
of
it
has
a
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
amount
of
hops
holding
it
up
there
is
an
undeniable
lemon
zest
on
the
finish
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
a
little
too
dry
on
the
finish
taste
features
a
slightly
malty
sweetness
with
a
pretty
strong
lemon
pressence
noted
in
the
aroma
and
pretty
high
level
of
slightly
peppery
spice
especially
for
a
summer
beer
really
a
little
more
than
i
would
prefer
there
is
a
lingering
lemon
zest
flavor
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
pleasantly
carbonated
at
a
good
level
for
a
summer
beer
spice
brings
drinkability
down
some
not
a
bad
brew
and
one
of
my
gateway
beers
into
the
craft
world
still
i
would
rather
other
american
wheat
beers
pours
a
hazy
tangerine
with
constant
bubbles
and
a
massive
frothy
fluffy
head
that
leaves
huge
raised
lacing
all
over
the
glass
smell
reminds
me
of
a
fainter
boston
lager
but
with
citrus
and
spicing
in
the
way
far
background
flavors
are
of
pale
malt
some
graininess
wheat
like
cracker
flavors
grains
of
paradise
and
mild
citrus
finishes
dry
with
a
little
bitterness
and
herbal
hoppiness
i
think
it
tastes
great
but
its
all
very
understated
i
wanted
for
more
present
flavors
carbonation
is
very
soft
in
the
mouth
and
fluffy
however
this
is
a
bit
too
light
bodied
im
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
it
is
really
drinkable
cheers
decent
mouthfeel
and
good
drinkability
make
this
an
acrosstheboard
4
for
me
theres
nothing
like
a
clean
and
refreshing
wheat
brew
on
a
hot
afternoon
this
would
pair
great
with
barbecue
or
burgers
ill
give
it
another
go
next
summer
for
sure
very
crisp
d
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
06
the
taste
was
light
definitely
not
a
hoppy
brew
but
nice
on
a
warm
night
not
sure
what
the
brewer
did
but
the
taste
has
changed
or
ive
moved
to
a
higher
beer
awareness
would
not
recommend
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
slihjt
white
head
that
dissolves
away
quickly
a
very
strong
bread
aroma
followed
by
a
bit
of
spiciness
at
the
end
a
very
mellow
wheat
taste
nothing
to
overpowering
in
the
hop
area
a
light
citrusy
taste
very
smooth
and
mellow
feel
a
little
bit
of
a
tingle
at
the
end
this
very
easy
to
drink
solid
flavor
and
very
good
feel
makes
you
want
to
drink
several
more
an
overall
good
beer
from
sam
adams
its
a
refreshing
wheat
ale
brewed
with
lemon
zest
that
tastes
great
after
one
or
two
but
after
a
few
they
loose
their
initial
luster
ive
also
heard
its
great
with
a
lemon
wedge
although
ive
never
tried
that
myself
all
in
all
its
a
good
beer
for
those
hot
summer
days
when
you
need
something
that
goes
down
easy
d
goes
soen
easy
not
a
filling
as
adrks
beers
so
drinking
a
lot
of
these
would
be
pretty
easy
overall
a
very
quaffable
summer
wheat
bright
yellow
and
cloudy
orange
in
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
smells
of
lemon
and
wheat
refreshing
in
yaste
light
with
a
full
flavor
of
hops
and
wheat
smooth
drinking
beer
with
good
lacing
on
the
glass
and
a
good
finish
a
good
and
standard
summer
beer
that
wont
fill
you
up
d
not
the
best
example
but
better
than
average
very
quaffible
and
refreshing
good
for
at
least
one
go
round
drinkability
okay
ive
had
onethird
of
the
bottle
in
order
to
finish
this
review
the
rest
goes
down
the
drain
another
good
brew
from
sam
adams
drinkability
these
can
be
consumed
almost
like
water
a
smooth
and
even
creamy
drink
for
a
summer
afternoon
a
bit
of
spice
but
otherwise
nothing
above
ordinary
in
taste
nice
wheaty
head
with
beige
colour
muted
citrus
taste
and
aroma
quite
consistent
creaminess
which
may
be
popular
but
for
me
worth
saving
to
add
to
hamburger
if
you
like
bass
ale
you
will
like
this
for
sure
d
this
beer
is
quite
nice
for
a
warmer
day
and
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
pretty
solid
across
the
line
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
this
summer
it
was
crisp
and
light
wheat
beer
the
flavors
of
lemon
and
spice
were
well
balanced
great
for
serving
at
a
summer
cook
out
this
beer
was
closer
in
taste
to
a
true
weisse
beer
from
germany
than
the
samuel
adams
hefeweizen
pours
a
cloudy
golden
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
with
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
weaksome
yeast
and
spice
body
is
light
to
medium
and
carbonated
taste
is
spiced
with
a
pepper
finish
this
a
refreshing
beer
average
in
most
ways
but
worth
a
try
kinda
weird
to
put
this
pale
wheat
ale
as
a
summer
brew
it
is
good
after
a
long
hot
day
but
the
lightier
body
isnt
a
good
thing
in
my
opinion
i
just
thought
that
was
the
only
thing
really
lacking
drinkability
an
easy
drinker
a
decent
beer
and
a
nice
one
to
have
outside
on
a
summer
evening
but
nothing
here
makes
me
take
notice
pours
a
golden
copper
in
color
with
a
surprisingly
long
lasting
offwhite
head
smells
of
wheat
hops
lemon
and
slightly
of
yeast
tastes
a
bit
grainy
with
hops
and
lemon
dominant
great
mouthfeel
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
with
good
body
good
drinkability
very
sessionable
drinkability
as
mentioned
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
d
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
quite
refreshing
tasty
wellworth
staying
with
especially
in
places
where
sam
adams
sam
adams
seasonal
are
your
only
choices
aside
from
macros
d
very
drinkable
a
perfect
beer
for
a
lazy
hazy
beach
day
summers
almost
over
and
so
is
this
beer
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
a
hazy
orange
solid
white
head
about
2
fingers
width
pulls
back
to
a
sticky
lace
cap
msells
like
a
standard
wheat
grainy
and
slightly
sour
a
lemon
flavor
comes
through
strong
as
if
the
unasked
for
lemon
wedge
was
laready
added
finishes
with
a
dry
wheat
flavor
mouthfeel
is
what
it
is
for
being
a
very
average
wheat
this
is
pretty
drinkable
definately
a
good
summer
brew
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
without
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
perhaps
the
pourers
mistake
the
smell
is
of
citrus
and
wheat
beer
a
delicious
combination
the
beer
is
fairly
balanced
but
i
couldnt
have
more
than
say
two
before
the
lemon
taste
started
to
get
to
me
a
great
offering
from
the
boston
beer
company
and
one
ill
have
on
any
hot
day
d
not
a
bad
refresher
but
there
are
better
brews
for
summer
i
wonder
if
its
this
fizzy
on
tap
pours
a
light
orange
slightly
opaque
but
not
dense
nice
lemony
citrus
aroma
not
overpowering
nothing
special
but
nice
nonetheless
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
it
tasted
nice
as
well
a
hint
of
citrus
again
lemon
and
maybe
some
tangerine
maybe
a
malted
tangerine
whatever
that
tastes
like
malts
were
nice
too
not
too
much
for
a
summer
ale
but
noticeably
present
solid
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
summer
brew
good
for
hot
days
after
working
in
the
yard
and
just
as
comforting
after
a
long
day
at
the
office
i
think
a
lot
of
sam
adams
beers
are
unjustly
criticized
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
brewery
makes
some
quality
beers
their
black
lager
is
another
example
of
an
overlooked
gem
sam
adams
summer
ale
is
a
brew
that
ill
revisit
again
next
summer
i
am
however
drinkig
this
in
the
heat
wave
of
2006
in
alafreakingbama
so
perhaps
i
am
just
drinking
this
at
the
right
time
drinkability
high
during
the
summer
in
any
other
season
forget
about
it
but
since
sam
is
marketing
this
as
a
seasonal
thats
all
im
going
to
score
it
on
its
a
great
summer
drink
bar
none
it
goes
phenomenolly
well
with
lemon
lime
chicken
and
i
implore
you
to
try
that
all
critiquing
aside
i
just
really
like
this
beer
and
while
not
the
best
summer
beer
ive
drank
its
probably
the
most
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
the
peppery
grains
of
paradise
dthe
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
the
fact
that
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
make
this
a
pretty
good
summer
beer
a
basic
and
fundimental
summertime
refresher
similar
to
a
standard
blonde
ale
with
a
grain
and
pilsner
flavor
under
a
light
carbonated
body
this
beer
has
an
added
citrus
lemons
with
a
mild
peppery
spicy
flavor
a
mild
haze
illudes
to
a
very
pale
wheat
addition
that
helps
with
a
breadiness
and
sweetness
that
disquise
the
grain
flavors
still
the
body
fades
into
a
watery
brew
fairly
quickly
but
adds
to
the
drinkability
a
mild
grain
citrus
and
hop
character
persists
into
the
finish
its
ok
beer
but
i
prefer
many
other
sam
adams
beer
more
this
was
an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
beer
yet
it
lack
of
flavor
and
disappointing
mouthfeel
made
it
rather
undesirable
pours
a
slightly
hazy
amber
small
white
head
forms
settles
to
a
thin
ring
some
lacing
smell
is
sweet
some
lemon
and
spice
caramel
and
yeast
taste
is
sweet
up
front
citrus
and
caramel
some
spice
in
the
finish
pretty
dry
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
really
not
too
bad
complexity
is
not
its
forte
but
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
ive
had
this
before
on
tap
and
i
remember
it
boring
me
but
this
isnt
so
bad
its
certainly
better
than
their
hefeweizen
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
uh
yeah
give
me
another
on
a
hot
summer
day
like
this
overall
a
good
refreshing
brew
im
enjoying
it
in
this
god
awful
heat
bottom
line
id
highly
reccomend
this
to
anyone
a
very
well
done
ale
and
gets
my
two
thumbs
way
up
ta
ta
when
i
got
it
the
beer
was
a
hazy
dark
orange
color
with
a
disappointing
head
of
foam
the
head
of
foam
was
white
in
color
but
it
had
almost
completely
dissipated
into
some
foamy
rings
and
very
little
lace
around
the
glass
the
initial
smell
was
just
the
faintest
of
hops
but
when
i
swirled
it
around
the
hops
were
still
there
but
with
just
a
hint
of
fruits
in
the
background
the
taste
was
very
crisp
with
a
nice
balance
of
malts
and
hops
and
with
just
a
slight
taste
of
juicy
fruits
at
the
very
end
i
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
because
it
was
so
crisp
smooth
creamy
and
with
an
aftertaste
of
malts
and
fruits
this
would
make
a
nice
choice
for
a
summer
beer
because
it
was
so
crisp
and
refreshing
its
probably
not
the
most
complex
summer
beer
out
there
but
damn
if
it
isnt
tasty
if
i
ever
saw
this
ontap
and
there
wasnt
much
of
a
selection
id
probably
get
it
again
mild
wheat
flavor
with
a
hint
of
lemon
finishes
with
an
odd
mouth
drying
quality
not
the
best
sam
adams
with
an
offputting
wrongness
to
it
a
good
hot
weather
beer
a
bit
too
dry
on
the
finish
left
my
mouth
feeling
powdery
other
than
that
pretty
good
drinkabilityoverall
a
unique
marriage
of
an
apwa
and
their
winter
lager
a
summer
warmer
plenty
complex
refreshing
and
innovative
drinkability
this
is
good
goes
down
well
and
is
very
sessionable
a
category
society
needs
but
being
the
snob
i
am
i
can
skip
this
kind
of
stuff
carbonated
lemonade
would
be
too
harsh
but
you
know
what
i
mean
lets
make
it
country
simple
summer
is
a
nasty
little
wench
you
sweat
the
dogs
get
fleas
the
grass
burns
up
and
your
woman
makes
merry
behind
the
bush
with
a
man
with
muscles
and
tattoos
and
a
goatee
summer
isnt
for
you
but
being
as
misery
is
mans
constant
companion
he
needs
something
to
knock
back
his
head
like
a
soft
little
hammer
and
bring
on
subtle
displays
of
fireworks
and
enjoyment
heres
where
samuel
adams
comes
into
play
you
see
they
make
the
best
beer
in
america
i
know
all
of
these
brewgurus
blast
off
little
soliliquoys
expounding
upon
foreign
yeasts
by
companies
with
intricate
brew
talents
and
clever
little
brand
names
but
these
guys
are
the
microbrew
with
the
big
company
expertise
in
consistency
and
quality
snap
the
top
off
this
thing
like
one
of
those
wax
bottles
of
sugar
juice
you
used
to
get
as
a
kid
and
sop
it
up
with
your
hot
swollen
tongue
its
like
drinking
nectar
from
a
sponge
with
subtle
hints
of
mushrooms
yeast
fungii
rock
candy
stand
back
with
your
pisspucker
salute
ye
drinkers
of
budweiser
while
i
explode
like
a
rocket
over
damascus
i
reviewed
this
beer
served
on
tap
frosty
cold
in
a
frosted
beer
mug
it
is
definitely
improved
at
more
normal
temperatures
the
head
is
larger
hangs
in
there
a
little
longer
and
the
smell
is
sweeter
and
more
pronounced
the
flavor
is
about
the
same
but
a
little
stronger
citruswheatslight
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
about
the
same
rich
enough
for
this
style
of
beer
drinkability
is
better
at
a
normal
temperature
than
frozen
mainly
because
the
flavor
is
crisper
and
more
interesting
a
nice
summer
drink
not
a
bad
hot
weather
beer
had
several
on
the
golf
course
a
few
days
ago
but
actually
rated
it
today
strong
aroma
of
wheat
and
cookie
dough
pours
to
a
hazy
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
taste
of
hops
and
wheat
in
early
bottle
actually
had
a
salty
wheaty
taste
at
midglass
and
okay
finish
bottle
was
different
than
shown
in
the
picture
above
mine
was
the
normal
sam
adams
cover
with
a
summer
ale
logo
with
similar
colors
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
smell
is
mostly
citrus
with
yeasty
characteristics
and
some
wheat
notes
taste
is
very
similar
mostly
of
lemon
notes
and
yeast
the
wheat
lends
itself
to
the
infusion
of
flavors
it
is
a
very
light
body
with
notable
flavors
that
do
not
over
power
you
but
definitely
show
themselves
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
because
it
is
light
and
very
tasty
when
it
is
cold
the
mouthfeel
is
normal
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
which
doesnt
take
away
from
the
overall
balance
of
the
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
fits
most
occasions
i
have
enjoyed
most
sam
adams
selections
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
i
would
suggest
checking
this
one
out
especially
if
you
are
a
fan
of
lighter
wheat
beers
overall
to
be
honest
i
fancied
a
good
but
cheap
brew
from
ralphs
last
night
the
change
of
label
design
had
me
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
one
just
out
of
intrigue
to
see
if
the
beer
itself
had
changed
it
hasnt
nice
to
revisit
it
and
a
decent
enough
wheat
ale
but
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
onceortwiceasummer
pick
up
and
not
a
regular
one
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissapaed
to
not
much
of
a
film
and
leaves
a
little
lace
the
smell
is
mildly
of
wheat
with
some
citrusy
aroma
the
taste
is
also
mild
with
some
lemony
flavors
and
slightly
spiced
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
with
heavy
carbonation
overall
highly
drinkable
summer
beer
d
great
beer
better
than
i
was
expecting
maybe
my
girlfriend
would
like
this
one
smells
lightly
of
lemon
and
citrus
appears
opaque
cloudy
and
orangeyellow
a
white
head
fades
fast
to
nothing
on
top
this
beer
is
fullbodied
but
sweet
light
and
sugary
lemon
and
other
fruit
flavors
are
apparent
there
is
an
oily
and
rich
finish
with
matching
aftertaste
cheers
ive
always
enjoyed
this
particular
ale
but
this
year
it
seems
a
little
spicier
than
usual
i
dont
know
if
those
are
esthers
from
it
being
a
wheat
ale
or
if
they
are
adding
something
more
than
lemon
zest
this
year
but
i
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
mellow
for
a
wheat
but
not
completely
eradicated
the
head
is
nice
a
lofty
with
some
lacing
they
brew
it
about
4
miles
from
here
too
so
perhaps
this
is
my
first
fresh
samual
adams
summer
ale
drinkability
accessible
refreshing
on
a
summer
day
jason
called
this
a
tonedowned
white
ale
and
i
think
thats
a
good
description
sammy
makes
some
really
good
ones
sammy
makes
some
soso
ones
this
is
one
of
the
good
ones
cloudy
gold
and
smooth
in
appearance
head
is
decent
little
lacing
but
what
the
hell
lets
have
a
swig
light
hoppy
and
malty
flavor
combine
very
well
there
is
that
underlying
sweetness
that

it
and
then
drink

thank
you
mr

up
the
excellent
work

highlights
the
short
but
creamy
white

fairly
well
and
leaves
some
minor
lacing
the
nose
is
interesting
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
some
wheat
medium
bodied
crisp
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
clear
notes
of
wheat
and
a
lemony
side
some
peppery
spiciness
helps
to
balance
the
malt
and
a
firm
bitterness
backs
it
wellmade
enjoyable
and
refreshing
this
ale
is
great
for
cookouts
however
the
spicy
tartness
may
leave
the
palate
exhausted
after
a
couple
bottles
overall
not
an
amazing
beer
but
nice
enough
definitely
good
for
a
hot
and
humid
day
aptly
named
this
beer
is
perfect
for
summer
drinking
it
poured
a
light
corn
color
and
the
smell
of
citris
storms
up
ones
nose
at
first
whiff
drinking
its
heavy
on
the
lemon
and
orange
peel
its
tart
but
not
overly
sweet
its
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
tart
may
get
annoying
after
a
while
if
the
beer
warms
up
i
found
myself
getting
tired
of
the
lemony
taste
after
a
while
not
the
best
summer
seasonal
out
there
but
as
a
sam
adams
beer
it
does
have
the
advantage
of
popping
up
in
the
majority
of
bars
during
the
hotter
months
drinkabilitynotes
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
brew
it
was
one
of
the
first
micros
that
i
feel
in
love
with
now
i
realize
it
is
not
the
best
or
most
complex
but
still
a
solid
brew
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
simple
but
fun
beer
always
a
hit
at
bbqs
any
easily
quaffable
brew
think

watching
thirsty
people
walking

the
beer
for
that
this
is
probably
one
of
sam
adams
better
offerings
12
oz

out
an

color
it
had
a
nice
foamy
head
the
beer
smelled
of
lemon
and
citrus
the
lemon
flavor
was
complimented
by
the
wheat
taste
and
a
hint
of
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
slightly
grainy
it
is
a
nice
light
brew
for
summer
and
very
drinkable
goes
down
easy
and
a
good
choice
for
the
patio
drinkability
although
the
peppery
finish
adds
an
interesting
twist
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
enough
other
attributes
to
make
me
want
to
have
another
the
aroma
was
great
lemon
and
grains
with
hints
of
spice
i
hope
it
tastes
like
it
smells
ah
it
does
light
mouthfeel
that
goes
down
smooth
not
an
over
bearing
wheat
grain
as
i
have
not
liked
in
the
past
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
have
another
and
cant
wait
to
try
others
in
this
style
i
always
like
season
beers
because
if
done
right
they
embody
and
fit
the
season
for
which
they
are
brewed
this
summer
ale
is
a
good
example
of
such
this
beers
appearance
is
not
much
to
brag
about
it
has
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
full
white
head
the
scent
is
a
bit
better
a
soft
wheat
citrus
smell
but
the
taste
is
far
better
than
its
aesthetics
the
beer
has
a
delicious
soft
wheat
taste
followed
by
a
crisp
citrus
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
also
very
superb
a
very
drinkable
beer
even
when
fairly
warm
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
a
perfect
drink
for
a
hot
summer
day
cloudy
golden
orange
in
color
with
a
foamy
white

that
falls
fairly
quickly

the
taste
is
good
a
a
crisp
citrousy
taste
with
the
wheat
taste
only
slighly
noticeable
good
hot
weather
beer
these
go
down
easy
nice
to
have
around
throughout
the
summer
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
a
golden
blonde
leaving
a
thick
white
lace
that
stayed
with
the
entire
glass
the
smell
is
sweetly
laced
upfront
is
honey
wheat
and
grass
the
taste
starts
with
a
tart
wheat
twang
that
is
pleasantly
balanced
by
a
honey
bready
mouthfeel
that
finishes
with
a
fruit
rind
bitterness
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
great
session
summer
brew
not
complicated
it
tastes
great
on
a
hot
day
not
flavorless
but
nothing
exciting
as
well
it
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
regular
pint
glass
with
a
nice
golden
color
with
about
an
inch
of
head
at
the
top
a
pretty
good
appearance
the
scent
had
hints
of
citrus
to
it
possibly
orange
or
lemon
my
first
impression
of
the
taste
was
that
it
was
fairly
crisp
and
went
down
very
smooth
definitely
something
i
could
sit
down
and
enjoy
on
occasion
i
would
say
that
the
overall
drinkability
is
good
for
this
beer
on
the
whole
i
really
liked
the
beer
killing
a
6er
of
this
would
be
an
enjoyable
task
for
an
evening
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
the
beer
has
an
odd
buttery
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
isnt
bad
the
beer
doesnt
rise
to
above
average
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
little
head
this
beer
was
served
very
very
cold
i
know
that
wheat
beers
should
be
about
the
coldest
of
them
but
this
was
almost
numbingly
cold
the
first
few
sips
were
refreshing
though
because
of
the
temp
it
was
hard
to
pick
up
on
much
in
the
nose
beyond
the
typical
wheat
and
slightly
hopped
smell
as
the
beer
got
to
a
normal
drinking
temp
i
was
able
to
pick
up
on
more
of
the
citrus
feel
and
more
of
the
hop
florals
as
far
as
the
drinkability
goes
this
beer
can
be
sessioned
as
easily
as
anything
i
started
and
finished
a
session
off
with
this
beer
and
really
enjoyed
it
at
both
ends
for
what
this
beer
is
its
quite
refreshing
and
does
the
job
as
good
as
any
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
day
i
spent
a
year
living
in
the
persian
gulf
the
base
liquor
store
sold
this
stuff
during
the
summer
months
i
ended
many
a
day
on
my
balcony
sipping
one
of
these
as
the
sun
set
maybe
its
those
memories
but
i
really
enjoy
this
one
d
im
adding
a
point
because
some
people
e
g
my
wife
who
doesnt
normally
drink
beer
seem
to
like
this
but
this
didnt
do
it
at
all
for
me
if
you
like
some
of
the
weirder
fruity
beers
magic
hats
9
comes
to
mind
this
might
be
right
up
your
alley
but
if
you
like
your
beer
to
taste
like
well
beer
then
drink
with
caution
i
think
mine
was
a
bit
too
cold
which
affected
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
at
first
i
let
it
warm
up
in
my
hand
and
it
became
much
more
pleasant
the
color
is
a
fuzzy
orange
the
lemon
is
very
prevalent
in
the
smell
and
taste
the
lemon
flavor
makes
it
refreshing
which
is
nice
for
a
summer
beer
even
though
i
feel
the
whole
summer
beer
thing
is
a
bit
of
a
scam
enjoy
d
at
first
it
as
a
big
sour
bite
too
it
if
you
let
it
warm
a
little
you
will
do
just
fine
overall
its
a
really
great
beer
but
nothing
about
it
particularly
catches
the
drinkers
attention
for
some
beers
however
thats
a
good
thing
this
would
be
great
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
evening
outdoors
very
relaxing
and
refreshing
i
drink
the
blue
moon
beer
in
the
summer
time
and
this
is
an
interesting
alternative
overall
its
a
decent
summer
beer
though
more
powerful
than
most
other
summer
beers
one
of
my
original
gateway
beers
from
macro
to
micro
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
vanishes
great
aroma
very
citrusy
taste
is
refreshing
dominated
by
citrus
and
yeasty
fairly
tart
this
beer
is
delicious
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
new
england
had
this
ontap
while
waiting
for
my
flight
back
from
detroit
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
goldenorange
color
nice
head
that
left
some
lacing
the
smell
wasnt
very
strong
but
wheat
and
lemon
were
noticeable
taste
was
very
refreshing
wheat
citrusy
lemon
and
a
touch
of
spice
all
balanced
nicely
goes
down
smooth
with
just
the
right
carbonation
for
a
warm
summer
day
im
sure
i
will
be
having
more
of
these
as
the
weather
warms
this
on
my
top
ten
list
for
hot
weather
beers
with
flavor
these
flavors
include
a
sort
of
lemonbuttery
character
that
rather
oddly
reminds
me
of
some
lemon
poppy
seed
bread
i
had
the
other
day
along
with
a
pleasant
wheat
maltiness
this
beer
requires
a
really
strong
pour
in
order
to
really
get
a
good
dose
of
its
aroma
which
as
indicated
on
the
bottle
is
spiked
with
lemons
the
carbonation
is
quite
good
and
produces
a
large
rocky
head
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
adds
to
the
incredible
drinkability
again
one
of
my
favorite
hot
weather
beers
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
was
a
nice
cloudy
golden
honey
color
with
good
head
looked
like
a
good
wheat
smell
was
very
average
on
the
weaker
side
the
taste
was
also
really
weak
even
for
an
apwa
mouthfeel
was
ok
think
ill
stick
to
new
belgium
sunshine
wheat
in
this
category

drinkability
i
dont
see
many
positives
about
this
beer
and
the
lemony
aftertaste
ruins
it
for
me
this
tastes
more
like
lemonade
and
beer
not
a
terrible
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
one
id
pick
from
a
decent
selection
either
samuel
adams
summer
ale
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
aroma
seems
to
be
dominated
by
wheat
and
a
bit
of
citrus
wheat
makes
up
a
big
part
of
the
taste
some
citrus
is
present
too
some
funky
tastes
too
not
really
off
just
not
what
i
would
expect
this
beer
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
your
mileage
may
vary
nothing
spectacular
though
i
d
drink
it
before
any
thing
with
lite
in
the
name
in
your
cooler
this
one
remided
me
more
of
a
wheat
ale
than
american
pale
i
associate
hoppier
beers
with
the
american
pale
style
which
this
one
didnt
have
very
much
on
the
hop
side
it
definately
had
the
unfiltered
body
to
it
much
like
the
wheat
ales
so
this
seemed
more
of
a
wheat
ale
than
anything
to
me
the
taste
was
nice
and
crisp
something
youd
want
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
any
type
of
manual
labor
during
the
hot
summer
months
seeing
that
i
am
leaving
the
educational
field
for
the
summer
and
going
to
the
manual
labor
field
ill
be
drinking
this
one
more
often
than
not
yellowy
gold
look
with
a
small
white
head
little
bit
of
a
citrusy
scent
very
crisp
wheaty
taste
i
dont
like
adding
lemons
to
my
beers
but
it
wouldnt
hurt
this
one
for
a
sam
adams
its
pretty
smooth
but
still
too
carbonated
for
me
like
most
of
their
stuff
ive
had
overall
though
their
summer
ale
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
great
for
an
afternoon
in
the
sun
drinkability
will
be
good
to
have
a
few
of
these
at
an
evening
ball
game
beer
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
amber
color
and
has
a
nice
think
head
not
the
best
of
smells
but
if
you
can
try
you
might
be
able
to
make
out
a
citrus
smell
lemon
maybe
its
tastes
kinda
thick
not
in
a
bad
way
and
has
a
very
citrus
taste
not
so
strong
that
you
cant
taste
the
hops
but
citrus
is
no
doubt
the
main
taste
you
get
very
easy
to
drink
and
you
can
defiantly
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
especially
after
work
on
a
hot
day
this
does
and
excellent
session
on
those
hot
summer
nights
where
you
want
something
to
quench
your
thirst
drinkability
is
very
good
i
have
fond
memories
of
sweating
in
the
summer
heat
finding
refuge
in
my
basement
with
a
cooler
full
of
summer
ale
on
those
days
when
its
just
too
damn
hot
to
go
outside
for
any
reason
this
is
a
great
drinkable
beer
it
also
as
i
discovered
last
night
goes
well
with
nachos
and
spicy
chilicheese
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
for
the
style
not
too
thin
but
im
kind
of
in
limbo
about
it
definitely
meant
to
be
a
refreshing
easydrinking
beer
and
it
is
but
i
guess
im
looking
for
something
more
from
it
i
love
sam
adams
beer
because
they
have
have
such
a
wide
variety
of
different
beers
to
suit
everyones
taste
buds
i
first
sampled
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
2nd
annual
blews
n
brews
festival
in
fayetteville
nc
this
easily
became
my
favorite
beer
of
the
fest
this
is
a
great
session
beer
since
it
is
sort
of
light
i
really
enjoyed
the
tase
of
the
beer
the
other
great
thing
is
that
i
can
get
this
beer
in
a
keg
raleigh
nc
if
i
want
to
make
the
hour
drive
up
there
i
stock
up
on
this
beer
every
summer
now
and
since
it
is
semi
easy
to
find
here
in
the
south
i
drink
this
when
i
dont
have
my
favorites
on
hand
like
many
of
sam
adams
products
its
decent
but
very
standard
run
of
the
mill
type
stuff
thats
neither
offensive
or
interesting
beyond
just
a
solid
drinking
brew
i
took
the
summer
ale
in
slowly
to
devour
all
its
elements
as
it
made
me
think
of
daydreams
long
since
forgotten
in
years
past
i
also
thought
this
beer
would
be
great
with
jamaican
jerkchicken
mustardglazed
sirloin
steaks
and
bunch
of
good
friends
sitting
a
round
a
picnic
table
this
summer
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
actually
this
might
be
good
with
a
wedge
of
citrus
in
it
i
have
never
been
dissapointed
in
a
sam
beer
this
ale
has
a
great
bottle
smell
poured
into
a
chalice
and
it
formed
a
nice
frthy
head
that
held
up
well
color
is
a
translucent
maize
smell
is
very
whole
grain
with
hints
of
citrus
and
pepper
mouthfeel
is
great
different
flavors
from
tongue
to
cheek
to
back
of
throat
a
very
talented
ale
starts
sweeter
gets
robust
then
finishes
with
a
peppery
sweetness
though
not
really
sweet
a
unique
concoction
i
will
be
back
for
more
i
dont
understand
how
sam
gets
it
so
wrong
with
their
main
brand
but
rocks
the
world
with
their
seasonals
probably
my
least
favorite
sam
seasonal
but
still
a
good
beer
not
my
favorite
style
very
drinkable
and
clean
pours
a
hazy
copper
tone
with
a
two
finger
cap
fell
into
slight
taverns
leaving
light
lacings
up
side
smell
was
citrus
biscuit
and
yeast
reminded
of
a
witbier
same
for
taste
had
grain
yeast
and
citrus
had
a
musty
bitterness
very
refreshing
beer
mild
carbonation
and
a
little
on
the
watery
side
notes
according
to
the
brewer
this
is
not
a
witbier
but
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
instead
the
picture
of
the
bottle
is
apparently
out
of
date
witbier
ehh
im
a
big
fan
of
wits
but
calling
this
a
wit
is
doing
both
the
style
and
this
ale
a
disservice
classification
aside
this
ale
is
a
refreshing
exploration
of
some
unique
flavors
the
grains
of
paradise
addition
provides
a
crisp
and
refreshing
complexity
that
is
in
the
perfect
amount
detectable
but
doesnt
demand
center
stage
or
overwhelm
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
a
well
balanced
crisp
ale
perfect
for
backyard
bbq
season
there
are
better
selections
for
a
summer
day
but
if
offered
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
sas
summer
ale
pours
as
a
cloudy
light
bronze
brew
with
a
light
foamy
head
after
several
minutes
the
head
dissipates
to
a
foamy
froth
and
eventually
leaves
behind
a
thin
lace
seems
they
leave
a
little
yeast
behind
to
maintain
a
heffe
weizen
appearance
the
malt
is
immediately
present
but
you
can
easily
detect
the
lemon
presence
with
a
tinge
of
hop
aroma
this
seems
kind
of
thin
and
with
plenty
of
co2
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
summer
evening
id
give
it
another
try
a
nice
presentation
but
faltering
delivery
pours
out
to
a
hazed
yellow
color
with
a
royal
richness
about
it
medium
head
of
foam
and
medium
low
carbonation
no
lace
aromas
of
fresh
citrus
grassy
notes
and
some
wheat
and
grain
taste
was
bland
and
a
definite
let
down
malt
and
weak
peppery
notes
of
citrus
die
quickly
and
touches
of
hops
and
grain
are
noted
in
the
mix
way
too
weak
on
the
flavors
mouthfeel
was
like
a
brate
movie
doable
but
boring
drinkability
is
fair
but
there
are
far
better
witbiers
out
there
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
decent
wheat
beer
however
not
one
of
my
favorites
d
a
deadaverage
beer
on
almost
every
count
and
yet
i
find
myself
quite
enjoying
it
goes
well
with
food
or
on
a
hot
day
good
summer
beer
this
poured
a
nice
cloudy
orangey
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
and
sweet
with
definite
hints
of
wheat
hops
and
citrus
smells
also
in
the
taste
we
have
the
lemony
citrus
flavors
which
rock
malt
flavor
is
nicely
noticeable
at
the
end
of
the
gulp
nice
and
wheaty
mouthfeel
is
weird
kinda
heavy
but
in
a
light
grainy
full
way
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
where
this
beer
lacks
is
in
creativty
and
complexity
how
many
beers
have
we
had
that
taste
exactly
like
this
i
have
had
a
fuckload
but
this
one
is
one
of
the
cleaner
ones
when
it
comes
to
taste
very
defined
a
very
pleasant
brew
that
i
wouldnt
limit
to
a
summer
day
good
beer
it
does
not
fit
the
defination
of
a
wit
for
me
it
seems
more
like
a
spiced
american
wheat
but
it
is
a
good
beer
very
tasty
and
refreshing
but
the
presence
of
the
tannic
note
makes
it
a
little
less
desirable
as
a
session
brew
for
me
overall
a
very
good
wheat
ale
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
drinkablity
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
perfect
in
the
heat
i
love
this
beer
like
all
sam
adams
d
easy
to
drink
all
day
on
the
porch
or
at
a
bbq
one
of
the
more
impressive
beers
that
ive
had
from
sam
adams
most
of
thier
beers
are
at
least
decent
but
this
one
is
actually
quite
good
i
think
ill
have
to
go
buy
another
6pack
of
this
overall
this
is
a
hohum
wit
probably
more
accurate
to
call
it
a
pale
wheat
but
what
it
lacks
in
subtlety
or
complexity
of
flavor
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
i
still
could
kick
back
and
down
a
sixer
of
these
without
batting
an
eye
and
if
my
pistons
make
it
to
the
nba
finals
again
i
might
have
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
as
a
good
luck
charm
for
old
times
sake
all
in
all
i
enjoy
it
this
is
one
of
the
few
sam
adams
varieties
i
havent
tried
yet
like
the
commercials
says
there
are
19
this
isnt
the
best
but
its
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
cheers
really
more
of
a
slightlyinteresting
american
wheat
than
a
traditional
wit
this
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
not
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
department
the
beer
looks
and
smells
nice
though
unimpressive
overall
d
high
easy
to
pound
would
be
mighty
easy
to
kill
a
30
pack
of
these
on
a
summer
evening
pale
straw
color
small
white
frothy
head
smell
is
light
orange
peel
with
some
yeast
thrown
in
the
taste
is
a
combination
of
dusty
pale
malts
spices
and
zesty
citrus
light
body
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
overall
it
was
a
good
thirstquencher
and
helped
my
burger
slide
down
the
hatch
a
little
easier
but
nothing
too
extraordinary
here
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
very
nice
carbonation
and
resulting
experience
in
the
mouth
gently
foamy
on
a
good
mouthful
of
beer
ddifferent
to
me
but
still
drinkable
i
can
see
this
as
a
good
pool
side
beer
but
as
i
finished
this
one
it
started
feeling
a
little
heavy
for
a
summer
brew
to
that
point
about
1
more
would
be
enough
12oz
brown
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
august
06
pours
a
cloudy
goldslight
amber
with
a
2
finger
head
good
longevity
and
equally
good
lace
smells
of
wheat
malt
with
citrus
and
some
spice
not
a
big
hop
presence
again
good
wheat
malt
with
some
citrus
zing
and
twang
hop
presence
is
more
detectable
but
still
not
a
major
factor
spices
are
a
bit
odd
but
they
do
work
in
this
beer
a
bit
thick
but
still
very
drinkable
not
a
lawnmower
beer
but
still
a
decent
summertime
ale
this
is
an
excellent
if
not
overly
complicated
ale
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
house
of
cues
in
cleveland
very
yeasty
in
taste
and
a
little
more
sweet
than
your
average
wit
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
tangyness
assosiacted
with
the
style
but
is
very
smooth
going
down
it
isnt
too
complicated
overall
but
it
is
very
good
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
want
to
have
a
sixer
of
when
you
are
out
griling
or
just
sitting
in
the
backyard
this
offering
from
sam
adams
poured
out
on
draft
to
a
golden
colorslightly
cloudyyet
appealing
the
aromas
were
of
wheatcitrus
and
yeasts
as
well
as
spice
the
taste
had
many
of
the
aromas
listed
above
and
you
could
really
get
the
citrus
or
lemon
in
the
flavor
the
body
was
slighly
thin
and
the
head
on
the
beer
quickly
dissappeared
this
is
a
pretty
good
and
refreshing
beervery
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
nice
drinkable
summer
wheat
beer
from
sam
adams
nothing
id
yearn
for
a
nice
6
pack
of
this
would
be
fine
for
a
summer
day
watching
the
sox
brown
12
ounce
longneck
with
best
by
august
2006
notched
on
the
label
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
good
retention
plenty
a
sticky
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
refreshing
citrusy
aroma
with
a
little
malt
and
dry
yeast
in
the
background
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
with
subtle
citrus
and
spice
notes
this
is
a
beer
i
could
have
again
and
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
did
i
say
it
was
refreshing
this
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
its
alittle
disappointing
looking
the
smell
is
light
with
only
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
and
lemon
to
it
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
with
lemonwheat
and
malt
sweetness
to
it
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
and
like
the
label
says
not
a
bad
summer
beer
ah
summertime
when
the
wheat
beers
come
out
and
body
and
flavor
take
a
back
seat
maybe
a
little
harsh
but
id
prefer
an
ipa
or
anything
more
like
a
winter
brew
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
head
it
had
a
sweet
fruity
odor
it
tasted
of
lemon
with
maybe
some
hops
in
there
i
couldnt
tell
for
sure
an
average
nondescript
beer
tried
the
justreleased
2006
batch
during
a
recent
tour
at
the
brewery
in
boston
overall
a
very
drinkable
wheat
beer
visually
it
has
a
cloudy
amber
color
and
a
very
mild
nose
it
still
has
the
lemon
zest
taste
it
did
last
year
however
compared
to
the
white
ale
we
had
sampled
just
before
the
summer
ales
flavors
are
mild
in
comparison
the
finish
is
also
mild
but
does
last
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
did
not
think
that
a
sa
got
better
than
the
boston
lager
i
was
wrong
this
is
my
favorite
of
a
generally
great
line
of
beers
verdict
light
and
effortlessly
drinkable
this
is
a
good
way
to
welcome
the
warmer
weather
good
carbonation
adds
to
the
pleasant
mouthfeel
not
a
beer
to
seek
out
but
not
a
beer
to
turn
down
not
as
good
as
the
offerings
from
point
or
coorsblue
moon
this
beer
seems
to
taste
pretty
much
the
same
from
yeartoyear
and
it
keeps
well
also
since
the
cases
i
got
earlier
this
year
were
the
2004
edition
recommended
regardless
of
what
the
score
is
on
here
the
spice
is
a
little
over
the
top
and
generic
and
its
a
little
dry
but
not
bad
better
summer
beers
out
there
and
after
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
few
months
i
dont
want
any
more
noteits
better
on
tap
if
you
ask
me
ive
had
it
outta
the
bottle
and
it
is
not
as
good
from
the
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
didnt
last
but
left
some
lacing
aroma
wheat
lemon
orange
spicey
flavor
peppery
orange

nice
clean
and
crisp
enjoted
this
one
for
a
company
that
puts
out
a
lot
of
beer
they
sure
do
a
good
job
on
their
beers
it
was
my
summer
brew
of
choice
in
05
nice
lil
hazy
chill
orangeyellow
weak
head
very
citrusy
with
malt
in
the
nose
and
in
the
quaff
the
lemon
mixes
in
well
hints
of
spice
a
tidbit
of
clove
lite
and
tangy

great
session
bres
this
one
could
have
been
classified
as
a
hefe
but
still
a
pleasant
wit
final
notes
my
biggest
complaint
about
this
beer
is
the
sweetnessfruitiness
flavor
to
it
ive
only
had
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
this
and
reccomoned
the
boston
lager
its
alright
but
nothing
that
i
will
go
back
to
being
that
it
is
summer
time
i
figured
id
great
me
some
local
freshys
around
these
parts
sam
summer
reigns
supreme
the
style
is
a
bit
uninspired
but
when
its
fresh
there
is
not
much
more
you
could
ask
for
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
land
ho
in
orleans
poured
deep
gold
with
good
head
retention
murky
coloring
slight
fruitiness
to
close
out
the
beer
beyond
lemony
great
seasonal
beer
initial
sizable
light
foamy
head
fell
to
a
quarter
of
its
original
size
hazy
orangeyyellow
with
particles
because
unfiltered
left
some
rings
of
lacing
smell
of
citrus
lemon
rind
and
some
wheaty
earthy
grain
unexciting
tangy
citric
quality
dominates
the
taste
a
bit
cloying
maybe
on
a
killer
heat
day
otherwise
a
little
wheat
nothing
special
thin
mouthfeel
with
little
texture
to
entice
the
palate
only
reasonably
drinkable
as
a
refresher
at
a
scorcher
of
a
summer
grillout
or
something
not
terrible
but
pretty
average
drinkability
there
are
other
summer
beers
that
are
better
than
this
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
sam
adams
not
bad
not
horrible
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
also
seems
a
bit
less
sweet
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
south
street
seaport
at
the
pizzeria
uno
i
had
a
very
bad
experience
with
the
bottle
version
some
time
ago
so
i
was
not
expecting
too
much
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
arrived
at
the
table
with
half
an
inch
of
creamy
white
head
over
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
brew
a
nicely
done
pour
imho
the
aroma
was
fruity
floral
spices
and
fresh
hay
the
taste
was
mild
somewhat
citrusy
faint
wheat
malt
and
short
dry
finish
body
was
light
this
is
a
tasty
brew
worth
trying
again
this
thing
was
free
i
would
never
have
the
urge
to
spend
money
on
a
6
pack
of
these
things
when
much
better
alternatives
exist
light
mouthfeel
that
is
what
is
expected
per
the
style
im
not
much
of
a
wit
drinker
but
i
can
appreciate
a
good
dinner
beer
when
i
taste
one
overall
i
will
still
enjoy
one
of
these
guys
on
occasion
because
i
am
a
sam
fan
but
there
are
a
bunch
of
other
summer
ales
that
i
prefer
overall
an
easy
drinking
good
summer
ale
for
when
you
dont
want
to
have
to
think
too
hard
about
beer
not
bad
but
i
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
a
sixer
light
to
medium
body
mediumlow
carbonation
definately
not
something
i
would
drink
a
lot
of
however
its
a
good
start
after
a
long
day
of
work
something
i
wouldnt
mind
making
a
habit
of
buying
in
these
hot
summer
months
last
swigs
part
of
a
mixed
case
that
i
picked
up
for
some
summer
fun
nice
summer
quincher
in
the
heat
or
anytime
really
it
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
white
foam
and
a
fair
amount
of
lace
was
on
the
glass
while
drinking
this
ale
the
smell
of
a
mild
sweet
hop
filled
the
nose
along
what
seem
like
spicies
the
taste
was
of
a
tartsweet
hoppy
flavor
along
with
spicies
and
a
hint
of
wheat
and
yeast
not
bad
for
a
summer
quincher
the
taste
is
of
light
wheat
malt
with
not
much
hops
to
speak
of
there
is
plenty
of
citrus
and
light
fruity
flavor
present
as
well
as
some
slight
yeasty
flavors
the
sip
finishes
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
poured
a
cloudy
golden
orange
hue
with
a
dense
3
finger
head
excellent
retention
lemon
and
wheat
nose
with
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
strong
with
lemons
and
spice
too
strong
it
boarders
on
astringent
and
a
beer
with
thick
consistency
needs
more
carbonation
than
this
to
have
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
lemonspice
bite
leaves
an
aftertaste
in
the
finish
the
unbalanced
flavor
and
the
low
carbonation
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
refreshing
witbier
very
nice
summer
ale
well
made
and
very
sessionable
drinkability
smooth
drinkin
with
no
character
take
it
or
leave
it
pours
a
semicloudy
orangetinged
yellow
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
a
nice
lookin
summer
brew
smell
is
wheaty
with
yeast
and
lemon
peel
accents
taste
begins
with
a
light
grainy
flavor
followed
by
a
lemon
and
orange
fruitiness
cant
tell
if
its
the
ale
yeast
or
just
some
lemon
shit
they
put
it
in
and
a
lightly
spicy
flavor
reminiscent
of
a
witbier
corrainder
mostly
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
smooth
as
a
summer
beer
should
be
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
not
an
excellent
brew
but
a
good
summer
thirst
quencher
thats
easily
sessionable
especially
in
the
warmer
months
age
date
was
aug
05
poured

cloudly
yellow
with

very
small

sez
wheat
ale
brewed
with
lemon
and
grains
of
paradise
has
a
grassy
scent
with
a
very
nice
taste
this
is
a
very
socialable
brew
many
can
be
had
will
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
with
a
thick
frothy
head
smell
was
a
little
bit
fruity
and
a
little
bit
funky
but
not
really
a
whole
lot
of
either
taste
is
the
same
way
a
little
wheat
a
little
hops
a
little
of
the
citrus
and
spice
you
expect
from
a
wit
but
none
of
them
were
really
distinctive
odd
watery
mouthfeel
as
well
easy
to
drink
but
disappointing
pretty
wack
for
a
witbier
but
decent
for
an
american
wheat
which
is
what
the
sam
adams
website
classifies
it
as
despite
the
relative
blandness
the
summer
ale
rates
high
for
me
in
drinkability
it
is
very
refreshing
and
light
and
goes
down
very
easy
good
for
a
summer
session
while
stationed
at
the
bbq
pit
this
beer
poured
a
very
rich
amber
color
you
can
definitely
taste
the
lemonwheat
in
it
has
a
very
crisp
taste
to
it
yet
its
very
refreshing
and
the
aftertaste
sticks
around
for
a
bit
but
i
dont
mind
that
cuz
the
aftertaste
is
great
hurry
up
and
get
some
before
september
otherwise
itll
be
kinda
hard
to
find
mouthfeel
is
very
refreshing
and
bubbly
and
not
too
heavy
sticks
around
for
a
bit
is
lovely
drinkable
for
sure
i
could
have
plenty
of
these
a
lovely
summer
brew
or
any
season
brew
try
it
body
is
light
and
seltzery
not
bad
for
summer
quaffing
if
yer
looking
for
a
witbier
stay
away
otherwise
drinkability
is
good
having
just
had
a
moat
mountain
weiss
though
different
styles
i
would
choose
the
former
for
summer
sippin
drinkability
wise
its
light
and
refreshing
its
lighter
than
other
witbiers
ive
experienced
which
has
its
pros
and
cons
its
not
especially
interesting
but
it
is
pleasant
ill
try
this
ontap
next
time
i
get
a
chance
pours
a
cloudy
goldenorange
hue
with
a
small
flourish
of
a
white
head
that
vanishes
almost
immediately
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
mixed
with
diacetyl
and
some
background
notes
of
clove
banana
and
honey
palate
is
mostly
a
tangy
wheat
with
some
light
floral
hops
and
an
interesting
interplay
of
clove
coriander
banana
and
honey
mediumbodied
but
a
tad
watery
with
little
carbonation
decent
but
for
a
summer
ale
or
witbier
i
would
tend
to
reach
for
something
else
before
this
the
pour
was
rich
and
full
bodied
with
a
steady
single
finger
head
coloring
of
deep
amber
gold
with
a
burnt
orange
hue
a
nice
smell
of
hoppy
freshness
wrapped
in
a
blanket
of
orange
cream
with
a
hint
of
spearmint
i
quite
enjoyed
the
instant
taste
of
wheaty
citrus
the
smooth
finished
accounted
for
an
ale
that
goes
down
quick
without
realizing
you
have
hit
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
draft
version
is
a
nice
compliment
to
a
plate
of
raw
oysters
drinkability
quite
good
the
sweetness
takes
a
half
off
it
might
be
a
bit
much
after
a
few
but
otherwise
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
indeed
very
well
done
i
think
this
beer
is
a
bit
better
than
a
lot
of
the
folks
who
have
reviewed
it
care
to
admit
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
just
isnt
a
spectacular
drink
i
yearn
for
try
it
if
you
bump
into
it
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
seek
it
out
drinkability
i
had
one
didnt
care
either
way
for
another
i
wish
they
did
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
to
see
if
you
like
it
just
not
for
me
finger
licking
good
an
interesting
mix
of
flavors
and
definitely
refreshing
on
a
summer
day
but
nothing
really
to
note
either
the
citrus
is
a
little
too
much
or
the
other
flavors
dont
balance
it
out
properly
drinkability
i
was
bored
by
this
beer
there
wasnt
anything
really
all
that
out
of
balance
here
it
was
just
dull
i
know
this
style
usually
produces
a
milder
beer
with
more
subtle
characteristics
but
i
think
this
is
a
bit
too
mild
for
my
tastes
i
think
a
beer
like
allagash
white
is
a
better
representation
of
this
style
this
one
is
not
worth
seeking
out
much
better
this
time
off
of
the
tap
a
bit
cloudy
through
the
orangeyellow
with
a
white
fluffy
head
that
held
well
smelled
of
lemons
and
grass
reminded
me
of
florida
very
subtle
hoppiness
with
citrus
just
acidic
enough
and
a
sharp
but
quickly
clearing
finish
felt
just
a
tad
thin
but
was
very
drinkable
on
that
warm
summer
day
overall
pretty
drinkable
if
ordinary
summer
beer
the
best
choice
at
the
bar
i
was
in
and
id
drink
another
couple
if
need
be
i
want
to
like
this
brew
but
the
flavors
just
dont
meld
it
just
does
not
do
it
for
me
went
well
with
a
few
burgers
and
my
wife
drinks
it
i
like
witbiers
and
while
i
am
certain
this
was
served
colder
than
it
should
be
it
was
enjoyable
i
can
certain
see
people
not
immediately
recognizing
it
as
such
it
did
have
more
of
a
wheat
ale
taste
it
would
probably
go
well
with
summer
style
foods
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
i
would
recommend
it
with
reservations
its
a
good
starter
to
the
witbier
style
but
there
are
better
examples
of
it
if
it
had
a
little
bit
more
of
a
body
to
it
my
style
scores
would
go
up
but
its
a
decent
thirstquencher
overall
not
something
id
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
again
too
much
like
an
american
wheat
ale
for
my
taste
smells
of
lemons
and
cream
i
would
have
expected
this
to
be
rather
yeasty
but
it
isnt
at
all
at
first
there
is
some
creaminess
and
it
feels
rather
watery
but
then
suddenly
a
rather
fake
but
still
pleasant
lemon
flavour
takes
over
and
is
backed
by
a
subtle
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
grainy
flavour
not
filling
or
overly
satisfying
but
it
would
be
a
doddle
to
knock
back
a
few
of
these
so
it
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
poured
a
dark
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
half
finger
of
head
that
faded
quick
just
a
little
lacing
smell
is
rather
weak
but
is
mainly
of
lemons
and
spices
with
a
faint
maltiness
detectable
taste
is
spices
lemons
bananaas
cloves
and
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
pretty
well
balanced
and
a
lot
better
tasting
than
the
nose
would
indicate
the
beer
was
a
little
thin
bodied
overall
this
is
a
decent
spicy
witbiernot
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
but
nice
to
have
a
pint
on
a
hot
spring
day
overall
one
of
the
weaker
offereings
from
sa
mildy
refreshing
with
the
citrus
crispness
it
delivers
but
falls
way
short
of
a
go
to
summer
brew
as
a
side
note
i
tried
at
two
slightly
different
temperatures
it
was
much
easier
to
drink
at
the
colder
temp
than
the
slightly
warmer
temp
comments
certainly
a
good
summer
beer
i
say
that
it
is
worth
a
try
and
probably
at
least
a
siz
pack
not
bad
not
outstanding
refreshing
i
think
might
be
the
best
adjective
pours
a
light
amber
color
more
on
the
yellow
side
murky
with
very
little
head
smell
is
almost
non
existant
but
im
picking
up
some
spritzy
notes
and
spicyness
in
the
taste
theres
a
lot
of
lemon
character
and
corriander
perhaps
on
top
of
a
pretty
well
balanced
spicy
hop
and
light
malt
body
mouthfeel
is
a
little
off
drinkable
and
refreshing
though
so
keep
some
around
for
a
hot
summer
day
though
there
are
better
options
for
the
summer
ale
style
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
not
as
refreshing
as
i
might
want
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
think
it
gets
the
job
done
not
my
favorite
seasonal
variety
from
sam
adams
either
but
it
is
worth
a
try
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
some
orange
hues
the
smell
is
very
fruity
and
citrusy
oranges
lemonlime
grapefruit
and
possibly
even
strawberries
are
detected
it
also
seems
to
smell
a
bit
flowery
the
taste
is
not
overly
sweet
like
i
had
expected
its
very
zesty
i
taste
lemons
and
limes
spices
and
wheat
grains
the
flavor
is
very
sharp
and
to
the
point
and
the
incredible
zestiness
is
quite
an
eyeopener
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
great
sam
adams
brews
always
seem
to
score
very
well
with
me
in
this
category
they
do
an
excellent
job
with
the
carbonation
and
creating
the
perfect
body
for
a
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
good
quality
beer
ill
be
sure
to
buy
this
one
again
a
few
times
while
its
available
throughout
the
summer
overall
this
is
a
very
average
good
quality
beer
nice
to
have
around
for
company
but
nothing
at
all
for
special
occasions
its
like
they
received
so
many
complaints
that
the
beer
was
clear
and
crisp
that
need
need
to
explain
themselevs
to
the
consumer
i
just
thought
this
was
funny
tastes
like
a
wheat
beer
mixed
with
dishwater
disappointing
compared
to
the
so
many
other
great
beers
by
the
boston
beer
compnay
pours
light
orange
with
a
short
creamy
head
a
little
bit
of
lacing
robust
carbonation
aromas
of
nutty
wheats
whiffs
of
citrus
a
little
subdued
nose
taste
is
good
not
too
strong
not
too
weak
a
good
balance
of
wheats
with
minor
citrusy
notes
i
dont
taste
any
spice
in
it
though
seems
to
be
more
of
a
summer
wheat
ale
instead
of
a
witbier
but
very
drinkable
nonetheless
id
definitely
have
it
again
drinkability
this
was
refreshing
its
lack
of
strong
flavor
works
in
its
favor
here
it
goes
down
so
easy
definitly
for
the
summer
a
witbier
i
hardly
think
so
it
pours
a
clear
golden
with
light
copper
accents
and
a
scant
eggshell
colored
head
pale
malts
light
wheat
notes
and
a
light
hoppiness
with
faint
citrus
mainly
makes
up
the
aroma
some
husky
malt
astringency
and
moderate
hopping
raises
further
questioning
on
whether
this
should
be
categorized
as
a
witbier
its
rather
lifeless
and
bland
better
suited
for
summer
but
even
then
i
could
think
of
a
thousand
beers
id
have
before
this
in
terms
of
quality
and
enjoyability
sam
adams
beer
covers
a
fairly
wide
range
for
me
while
far
from
bad
this
one
is
solidly
in
the
bottom
half
im
not
sure
how
often
they
change
recipes
but
summer
ale
is
long
overdue
i
even
checked
the
notch
on
this
one
and
its
december
so
they
cant
blame
this
one
on
outofcode
its
just
not
very
damn
good
im
glad
my
roommate
bought
this
12pack
and
even
he
doesnt
want
another
one
so
i
dont
ever
have
to
deal
with
this
again
bottle
yuck
cloudy
orange
colour
is
ok
neither
sufficiently
attractive
nor
sufficiently
unappealing
to
draw
much
attention
to
itself
aroma
is
pleasing
soft
citric
notes
plus
some
cloves
but
the
taste
is
initially
quite
bland
then
stunningly
foul
mouldy
oak
possible
oxidisation
but
best
before
date
is
may
2004
10
months
away
ecrvich
also
notes
a
similar
experience
i
cant
get
past
that
foul
taste
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
long
lingering
peppery
burn
no
doubt
from
the
grains
of
paradise
its
now
creeping
up
my
nose
by
god
this
is
one
foul
foul
beer
drain
pour
translucent
straw
in
color
served
with
a
very
little
white
head
very
malty
and
bread
like
aroma
the
wheat
shines
through
with
a
sweet
and
clean
flavor
malty
and
without
hops
its
also
without
any
citrus
or
spice
as
the
style
suggests
it
should
be
listed
as
an
american
wheat
and
not
a
witbier
this
is
an
okay
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
boston
beer
company
nice
summer
afternoon
brew
but
not
an
earthshaker
i
gave
it
a
plus
on
drinkability
beacuse
it
is
a
thirst
quencher
but
ill
pass
it
over
for
a
good
pilsner
any
day
and
average
beer
at
best
this
one
poured
a
nice
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
faded
quickly
it
smelled
of
grain
and
spice
and
not
much
else
the
taste
was
decent
but
there
was
just
too
much
of
the
citrus
bitterness
there
to
enjoy
thoroughly
if
it
is
on
sale
get
it
if
not
do
not
pay
full
price
for
this
one
i
usually
enjoy
most
sam
adams
seasonals
unfortunately
this
is
one
that
i
wont
be
recommending
appearance
is
the
best
part
of
this
brew
dark
orange
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
very
good
head
smell
seems
off
to
me
though
i
cant
identify
why
taste
is
at
best
interesting
bottle
claims
this
was
brewed
with
wheat
malt
lemon
zest
and
grains
of
paradise
but
all
im
really
getting
from
it
is
the
lemon
zest
slightly
sweet
but
mostly
sour
there
isnt
anything
special
from
the
taste
of
this
not
especially
refreshing
either
a
trait
which
should
be
a
wheat
beers
forte
bottomline
a
rather
unhappy
marriage
of
that
distinctive
sam
adams
taste
with
the
wheat
beer
style
id
blame
the
citrusness
of
it
as
being
out
of
balance
had
this
on
tap
at
hard
times
in
herndon
va
this
appeared
a
very
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
bubbling
coating
atop
the
body
not
much
lace
was
left
either
as
this
was
consumed
smell
is
a
rather
weak
lemony
wheat
scent
that
has
a
touch
of
spice
that
peaks
out
from
time
to
time
taste
is
that
of
a
weak
wheat
beer
that
has
been
watered
down
the
spiciness
was
about
as
minimal
as
i
have
ever
had
in
a
wit
beer
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watered
down
a
bit
it
was
refreshing
and
went
down
easy
but
after
a
23oz
glass
of
this
i
had
enough
of
it
for
the
night
and
switched
to
something
else
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
for
a
wit
beer
but
it
would
be
a
decent
macro
replacement
a
very
cloudy
amber
ale
pours
with
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
vaguely
sweet
but
no
particular
sweet
aspect
can
be
determined
from
it
a
very
fruity
flavor
witha
light
hop
characteristic
in
the
background
the
fruity
flavor
reminded
me
of
mango
i
could
not
finish
drinking
this
it
was
like
drinking
a
v8
splash
mixed
with
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
amber
color
with
a
white
head
that
falls
to
half
finger
for
ride
down
the
glass
leaving
light
lace
smell
is
faint
wheat
malts
lemon
and
light
on
spices
taste
is
light
wheat
sour
then
lightly
bitter
get
light
spice
flavors
and
a
dash
of
lemon
tastes
like
a
good
wheat
beer
that
has
been
filtered
a
little
and
watered
down
for
mass
consumption
it
is
light
and
goes
down
quickly
good
thirst
quencher
body
is
light
side
of
medium
drinkablity
is
ok
if
options
are
macros
but
otherwise
wouldnt
purchase
again
picked
up
at
closest
grocery
store
to
home
hadnt
had
before
so
i
tried
it
damn
ba
always
has
me
buying
something
new
this
poured
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
healthy
head
of
creamy
white
foam
the
aroma
is
almost
like
sour
lemonheads
candy
citrusy
and
sour
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
bittersweet
with
floral
notes
and
small
amounts
of
buttery
malt
this
is
very
refreshing
sour
and
slightly
yeasty
this
is
another
good
poolside
summer
beer
nciecloudystraw

the
way
down

discernable

and
clean
on
the
palate

touch
of
spices
and

bodylends
it
to
being
a
beer
that
is
great
for
a
hot
day
overall
a
decent
enough
beertake
some
to
a
party
with
macro
drinkers
and
let
them
try
it
on
a
hot
summers
day
if
i
wasnt
totally
exhausted
i
could
have
drank
these
all
night
but
as
things
were
i
only
ordered
one
and
went
home
to
bed
after
dinner
great
summertime
beer
but
not
my
first
choice
the
taste
is
grainy
crisp
dry
and
refreshing
this
tastes
like
a
classic
wheat
ale
to
me
with
a
lemon
backdrop
great
for
summer
months
appeared
a
pale
amber
color
with
no
head
but
nice
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
light
lemons
and
spice
as
for
taste
it
was
slightly
fruity
and
reminiscent
of
a
wheat
beer
with
a
tinge
of
lemon
and
spice
it
had
a
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
it
was
crisp
and
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
it
wasnt
that
exciting
for
a
wit
is
it
even
a
wit
but
one
could
easily
enjoy
many
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
sam
adams
summer
ale
poured
a
nice
hazy
golden
yellowish
orange
color
with
a
sweet
wheat
aroma
a
nice
size
head
turns
into
decent
lacing
around
the
glass
first
sip
is
a
bit
fruity
and
smooth
i
like
it
definetly
a
good
drinking
beer
as
far
as
wheat
beers
go
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
its
not
spectacular
but
its
a
good
brew
and
i
will
be
coming
back
to
it
drinkability

with
both
the
temperature
and
humidity
hovering
in
the
mid90s
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
refreshing
summer
ale
this
one
just
did
do
the
trick
this
beer
should
probably
be
classified
as
an
american
wheat
rather
than
a
wit
i
would
have
rated
it
slightly
higher
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
carbonation
and
body
for
my
summer
ale
desires
at
the
time
pours
an
orangishyellow
color
with
a
thin
head
and
faint
aroma
i
really
didnt
pick
up
a
lot
of
citrus
in
the
aroma
i
didnt
expect
a
lot
of
lemon
flavor
as
its
actually
brewed
with
lemon
zest
which
to
me
has
a
slightly
different
flavor
than
lemon
perhaps
thats
what
i
was
tasting
because
i
really
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
it
its
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
id
prefer
the
boston
lager
or
boston
ale
over
this
it
is
refreshing
though
on
a
hot
humid
day
but
i
think
theres
better
choices
someone
said
this
years
was
better
than
last
years
and
i
have
to
agree
they
have
toned
down
the
grains
of
paradise
and
citrus
and
given
it
a
little
more
body
smell
is
kind
of
crispy
like
the
american
light
beers
the
taste
is
sort
of
lemony
whints
of
wheat
goes
down
easy
and
pretty
drinkable
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
amber
with
a
white
headskie
hops
are
light
but
still
add
flavor
malts
are
a
touch
thin
but
still
give
the
impression
of
a
full
beer
this
is
not
a
great
beer
but
it
stands
tall
as
a
dumbed
down
ale
quality
is
here
but
the
audience
is
not
the
ba
id
have
another
but
not
if
there
were
a
selection
to
choose
from
drinkability
is
above
average
ill
buy
again
very
drinkable
quite
good
naturally
this
is
a
better
beer
than
something
like
bud
or
mgd
but
its
a
lot
more
expensive
and
for
a
specialty
beer
its
not
that
interesting
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
i
notice
that
the
picture
provided
of
the
bottle
on
this
site
is
not
the
current
look
of
this
beer
for
summer
2004
so
note
that
my
review
is
of
a
bottle
that
had
a
drink
by
date
of
december
2004
let
me
state
up
front
that
i
love
sam
adams
beers
but
this
one
not
so
much
it
was
very
disappointing
and
is
indeed
as
mitchster
so
ably
pointed
out
in
his
review
it
leaves
a
cardboard
taste
in
ones
mouth
boring
watery
the
only
thing
that
can
be
said
is
it
may
be
refreshing
but
is
not
much
better
than
most
lite
beers
appearance
is
unfiltered
golden
orange
good
head
and
lacing
light
carbonation
aroma
contains
corn
lemon
and
faint
spice
paradise
is
the
spice
according
to
the
bottle
smooth
mouthfeel
taste
of
wheat
honey
and
bitter
herbal
with
a
dry
unpleasant
finish
taste
has
hints
of
banana
encircling
the
crisp
wheat
malt
spicy
and
quite
lemony
mouth
is
crisp
with
a
long
longering
lemon
flavor
and
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
very
smooth
brew
and
a
fine
and
perhaps
underated
summer
ale
overall
samuel
adams
summer
ale
2004
is
quite
excellent
i
was
very
impressed
i
am
glad
i
made
the
purchase
and
will
do
so
again
i
had
this
one
a
few
years
ago
and
thought
that
i
would
give
it
another
go
it
is
a
wheat
ale
first
smell
and
taste
tells
you
that
smell
is
citrus
taste
is
citrus
and
a
little
hops
pretty
clean
and
crisp
also
a
citrus
taste
to
it
i
think
it
is
pretty
damn
tasty
myself
but
it
is
a
little
too
much
to
be
considered
a
summer
to
me
too
filling
but
hey
it
does
have
flavour
this
is
the
most
drinkable
wheat
beer
ive
had
yet
it
has
the
characteristics
of
wheat
beer
but
the
negative
ones
are
muted
this
was
ok
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
their
white
ale
at
first
i
didnt
like
what
i
was
tasting
almost
like
envelope
glue
i
couldnt
believe
i
was
tasting
this
so
i
did
a
few
more
tastes
and
this
beer
is
a
light
flavored
hell
it
was
as
advertised
there
were
a
few
stronger
flavors
that
made
the
envelope
flavor
diminsh
and
when
i
had
food
the
taste
got
more
complex
still
this
beer
was
thin
and
while
average
in
drinkability
if
you
can
get
regular
sammy
choose
that
over
this
this
is
in
many
ways
a
typical
sam
adams
beer
unexciting
but
overall
slightly
above
average
it
is
an
unimpressive
golden
color
with
a
little
lace
it
smells
like
a
corny
macro
the
taste
however
is
better
than
the
smell
i
definitely
detect
a
bit
of
lemon
and
spice
along
with
the
slight
maltiness
and
hopiness
the
beer
is
definitely
easygoing
and
agreeable
and
i
could
picture
myself
drinking
several
at
a
summer
barbeque
note
this
is
a
fairly
mediocre
beer
by
samuel
adams
standards
their
similiarly
styled
white
ale
is
better
than
this
light
and
refreshing
tones
of
peaches
and
lemons
with
a
pleasant
spiciness
very
nice
quit
dissing
sammy
this
is
a
keeper
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
would
drink
straight
out
of
a
bottle
during
a
picnic
or
outdoor
party
and
sam
adams
trademark
low
carbonation
makes
slugging
it
straight
an
easy
task
when
poured
into
a
glass
its
nothing
exceptional
yellow
with
a
small
head
it
doesnt
smell
nearly
as
spicy
as
it
tastes
refreshing
drinkable
as
all
hell
simple
not
too
shabby
there
is
a
oneinch
almost
white
coarsish
bumpy
head
a
slightly
hazy
dirty
gold
body
sweet
fruity
nose
with
a
sourish
grainsiness
underneath
nutty
in
the
front
with
some
ripe
fruit
middle
is
fizzy
thinnish
still
a
little
sour
still
the
sourness
persists
through
the
bitter
finish
well
its
not
my
favorite
sammy
thats
for
sure
its
a
little
worse
than
the
average
crappy
micro
american
wheat
the
first
witbier
i
think
ive
had
that
i
can
truly
say
i
enjoy
a
very
good
brew
and
id
definitelly
buy
it
again
pours
a
bubbly
rather
hazy
honey
color
with
a
oneinch
whitish
head
first
to
the
nose
is
a
lemonbubble
gum
combination
a
characteristic
witbier
aroma
that
to
me
is
rubbbery
in
its
more
potent
varietals
though
a
bit
flat
in
the
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
passable
particularly
for
a
warm
summers
evening
there
is
only
a
touch
of
hops
a
few
light
spices
and
a
breadlike
finish
ok
but
not
inspiring
too
expensive
hence
low
drinkability
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
but
watery
however
it
is
fairly
drinkable
especially
at
at
a
party
with
heinekin
mic
ultra
and
corona
available
this
was
by
far
the
best
choice
its
not
bad
certainly
good
for
the
season
its
intended
for
but
im
not
going
to
knock
anyone
over
to
get
at
one
if
youre
truly
in
love
with
the
lemonhefe
idea
just
buy
paulaner
and
stick
a
lemon
wedge
in
it
overall
i
probably
wont
keep
buying
this
one
because
boulevard
does
this
style
just
as
good
if
not
a
bit
better
and
is
local
and
cheaper
but
it
is
ok
and
worth
a
try
hate
to
rate
a
sam
adams
beer
badly
but
you
got
to
call
it
how
it
tastes
this
beer
in
my
opinion
is
not
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
sesonal
brews
looks
and
smeels
nice
not
watered
down
has
a
flavor
just
not
a
very
plesent
flavor
i
think
better
than
bud
or
corona
but
i
wouldent
use
it
in
the
same
sentence
as
the
boston
lager
or
the
cherry
wheat
served
at
the
restraunt
on
tap
with
no
head
and
a
slice
of
orange
that
i
quickly
discarded
didnt
need
any
fruit
messing
up
the
beer
looks
like
a
muddy
carmel
in
the
glass
smells
of
hops
and
grain
but
very
subtle
nice
mix
of
spice
carbonation
hops
and
a
hint
of
citrus
a
pretty
straight
forward
almost
simple
beer
this
is
great
on
a
humid
summer
evening
this
refreshing
beer
really
hits
the
spot
i
wouldnt
drink
it
all
year
round
but
enjoy
this
one
at
a
cookout
over
some
good
conversation
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
wheat
scent
accented
with
lemon
zest
very
nice
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
wheat
flavor
which
is
drenched
with
lemons
quite
tart
it
goes
down
slow
and
finishes
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
unique
seasonal
it
has
good
wit
qualities
but
the
lemon
contribution
is
a
bit
much
other
than
that
its
not
a
bad
drinking
brew

sams
seasonal
was
my
session
beer
for
my
thursday
night
drinkin
and
this
one
held
me
thru
a
good
amount
of
months
not
too
heavy
as
too
keep
from
a
long
night
of
drinking
great
with
food
too
had
this
for
the
memorial
day
bbq
and
it
hit
the
spot
although
wouldnt
drink
unless
in
the
heat
of
summer
poured
a
gold
copper
with
a
fog
haze
head
was
decent
nothing
spectacular
white
lacing
slopped
around
the
glass
with
each
gulp
the
smell
is
of
strong
citrus
with
a
robust
malt
light
and
refreshing
to
the
nose
very
spring
like
the
taste
is
a
average
balance
of
malt
and
hop
bitterness
the
lemon
notes
are
light
a
strong
wheat
taste
brings
up
the
end
light
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
a
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
otherwise
just
lacks
that
smooth
refreshing
summer
ale
quality
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
and
has
decent
head
retention
lacing
is
scattered
has
a
strong
wheat
taste
accentuated
with
some
lemon
and
grains
of
paradise
i
dont
know
that
i
can
identify
the
latter
but
the
lemon
is
some
what
noticible
something
about
the
overall
taste
profile
i
just
dont
care
for
o
k
once
in
a
while
but
i
would
opt
for
a
lager
or
sierra
summerfest
any
time
over
this
one
i
was
dissapointed
though
it
could
be
drinkable
after
a
hike
in
the
hot
summer
sun
or
something
absolutely
nothing
special
about
this
witbier
it
arrived
in
a
pint
glass
with
golden
color
and
slightly
cloudy
appearance
there
was
a
minimal
head
the
smell
is
very
mild
and
of
a
citrus
nature
taste
is
rather
blanda
slightly
citrus
taste
really
couldnt
taste
malts
or
hops
or
anything
else
this
beer
is
really
not
worth
purchasing
not
a
bad
brew
sort
of
bridges
the
gap
in
between
straight
ahead
weiss
beers
and
the
usually
knockoff
american
descendents
complexity
of
flavor
and
strange
fakebanana
qualities
knock
down
drinkability
dark
gold
color
big
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
sticky
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
smells
light
and
grassy
lots
of
malt
and
a
hint
of
lemon
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
scent
of
a
euro
lager
taste
is
very
light
on
the
palate
yet
somehow
sharp
its
a
humid
rainy
spring
day
and
this
beer
goes
down
nicely
the
body
just
walked
away
rather
quietly
i
guess
this
means
it
qualifies
as
quite
drinkable
for
a
summer
thirst
quencher
had
a
few
of
these
tonight
for
the
first
time
very
light
beer
with
a
citrusypepper
taste
after
a
few
i
started
getting
sick
of
the
lemon
needless
to
say
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
its
an
average
to
decent
beer
that
will
probably
be
a
lot
better
when
it
gets
hot
out
pours
out
a
cloudy
orange
color
decent
sized
head
but
little
lacing
lots
of
lemon
scent
with
spicy
pepper
overtones
the
guy
at
the
samuel
adams
brewery
said
the
grains
of
paradise
are
an
actual
spice
that
is
has
a
slight
pepper
flavor
and
yes
that
is
the
real
name
of
the
spice
the
taste
is
average
dominated
by
lemon
and
pepper
again
could
do
with
a
little
less
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
have
to
say
its
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
man
i
cant
wait
to
break
out
the
grill
on
the
back
porch
definitely
someones
interpretation
of
a
witbier
strange
stuff
witbier
this
is
more
of
a
pale
wheat
beer
if
anything
poured
out
a
light
gold
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
smell
was
spicy
some
malts
and
wheat
also
detected
there
was
some
citrus
but
very
very
light
wheat
and
malt
set
up
the
backbone
of
this
brew
some
lemon
mixes
in
the
middle
grains
of
paradise
comes
in
the
middle
as
well
that
lasts
the
entire
way
through
some
of
that
wheat
stays
through
the
aftertaste
not
a
bad
brew
whatsoever
i
dont
know
if
i
would
call
this
a
witbier
but
not
bad
for
the
summer
months
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yelloworange
smells
of
lemon
zest
and
grain
taste
is
similar
but
more
watered
down
than
one
would
expect
from
its
initial
appearance
mouthfeel
is
smooth
although
lacking
of
flavor
which
knocks
it
down
a
point
drinkability
is
high
due
to
its
flavorless
watery
consistency
could
be
a
great
lawnmower
beer
but
i
much
prefer
the
white
ale
as
a
seasonal
even
though
it
was
only
9
99
for
a
case
i
feel
cheated
as
for
drinkability
eh
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
pretty
often
but
why
drink
this
if
sam
adams
white
is
still
available
overall
a
mediorce
summer
ale
that
goes
nice
on
a
nice
warm
day
wish
i
had
the
harpoon
though
what
the
hell
did
they
do
to
this
beer
it
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
not
anymore
the
taste
of
lemon
was
overwhelming
and
i
couldnt
even
finish
the
twelve
pack
they
need
to
get
back
to
the
old
recipe
and
label
because
this
new
one
really
sucks
this
seems
to
have
changed
a
bit
from
last
year
it
tastes
more
lemony
especially
in
the
aftertaste
not
such
a
bad
thing
but
i
think
i
liked
it
better
last
year
it
smells
pretty
wretched
though
not
sure
whats
going
on
there
it
kinda
smells
like
some
cheap
malt
liquor
maybe
steel
reserve
i
still
enjoy
the
taste
and
its
a
solid
summer
beer
drinkable
all
day
long
or
until
your
throat
hurts
from
the
lemon
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorites
for
many
years
it
pours
a
slight
gold
in
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipitates
fairly
quickly
the
aroms
is
best
described
as
bitter
sweet
the
taste
is
stroing
in
hops
and
the
lemon
flavor
is
more
than
just
a
hint
there
is
something
else
that
adds
to
the
sweetness
i
want
to
say
there
is
a
little
bit
of
honey
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
with
a
quite
pleasant
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
the
aroma
is
sweat
and
spicy
the
label
states
that
it
is
brewed
with
lemon
zest
and
i
guess
i
can
find
a
hint
of
it
in
there
the
first
taste
doesnt
really
have
much
to
it
spicy
and
smooth
finishes
very
clean
very
refreshing
and
great
after
my
long
day
of
playing
pickup
basketball
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
suits
the
style
well
who
wants
a
full
bodied
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
drinkable
but
it
leaves
me
wanting
more
typical
appearance
for
a
wheat
ale
amber
with
a
cloudy
hue
smells
slightly
citrus
but
also
yeasty
the
taste
is
light
and
a
little
fruity
with
some
yeast
typical
wheat
beer
flavors
lingering
overall
i
think
it
is
a
solid
offering
from
a
great
brewery
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
then
again
it
should
be
this
is
a
thinner
lighter
beer
for
spring
summer
enjoyment
not
a
beer
that
feels
like
eating
as
sandwhich
like
youd
want
in
november
or
february
it
is
very
drinkable
but
not
something
i
plan
on
stocking
in
the
fridge
as
a
regular
drink
good
thing
since
its
only
available
for
a
few
months
of
the
year
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
loves
samuel
adams
me
and
likes
to
change
what
they
drink
to
fit
the
seasons
big
fluffy
slightly
offwhite
head
on
a
slightly
cloudy
orangygold
hued
brew
bready
but
citrusy
aroma
which
the
taste
resembled
a
bit
thin
bodywise
but
certainly
an
acceptable
offering
from
boston
beer
perfect
sidekick
for
my
late
lunch
with
the
family
on
a
nice
spring
day
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
small
white
head
the
head
quickly
turns
into
a
fine
sheet
sitting
atop
the
liquid
and
leaves
little
lacing
clean
and
crisp
wheat
aroma
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
spice
malt
sweetness
and
crisp
dry
wheat
flavors
dominate
this
brew
some
lemon
and
spice
are
also
present
along
with
the
hops
all
of
which
balance
the
malt
finished
with
a
dry
graimy
note
i
did
not
find
the
lemon
as
overpowering
as
others
medium
in
body
and
smooth
on
the
tounge
not
as
crisp
as
i
expected
it
to
be
not
bad
but
nothing
special
id
rather
a
traditonal
wit
light
drinkable
brew
good
but
pass
the
german
weizen
please
notes
i
had
this
last
night
it
was
a
batch
from
last
summer
i
am
quite
sure
it
has
gone
bad
so
im
not
going
to
rate
against
it
as
this
was
my
fault
this
is
a
great
crisp
lemon
beer
with
the
sam
adams
seasonals
im
always
happy
to
see
the
new
one
out
on
tap
becuase
im
usually
tired
of
the
previous
one
a
good
choice
in
such
a
place
the
nose
is
subdued
just
a
trace
of
weiss
odor
head
is
thin
becomes
nice
and
lacy
color
is
hazy
yellow
like
a
good
wheat
beer
lemon
taste
is
definitely
there
some
spiciness
worth
tasting
in
season
though
not
a
craft
brew
type
anymore
all
in
all
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
witbier
style
a
good
interpretation
from
these
guys
highly
drinkable
nice
job
the
grains
of
paradise
in
this
beer
werent
detectable
by
me
and
the
lemon
was
very
lightly
done
while
this
wasnt
too
spectacular
in
any
area
this
was
a
pretty
drinkable
beverage
and
it
fits
the
summer
well
great
beer
to
have
in
the
summer
time
has
a
nice
golden
haze
when
poured
and
a
thin
creamy
head
its
a
light
summer
beer
thats
nice
to
have
after
working
out
in
the
yard
taste
is
a
little
strong
on
the
lemon
side
but
youi
can
always
throw
down
quite
a
few
goes
down
very
smooth
nothing
like
having
this
beer
during
a
bbq
and
sitting
out
in
the
sun
relaxing
i
miss
it
now
its
onto
octoberfest
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
this
beer
smells
of
wheat
and
lemons
the
taste
is
even
heavy
on
lemons
i
hate
having
a
lemon
in
my
wheat
beer
and
this
was
like
they
put
one
in
for
you
it
is
very
light
in
taste
and
hops
i
will
say
that
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
i
had
this
beer
quite
a
few
times
this
past
summer
at
local
establishments
and
while
it
is
drinkable
i
would
not
say
by
any
means
that
given
a
place
with
a
good
selection
this
would
be
the
beer
i
would
chouse
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
very
average
beer
medium
gold
color
small
white
foamy
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
sweet
lightly
malted
lightly
hopped
distinct
kind
of
overpowering
lemony
taste
light
refreshing
taste
not
a
lot
of
beer
taste
hops
and
malts
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
lemony
a
medieocre
offering
from
boston
beer
but
not
bad
pours
out
a
pale
yellow
with
a
little
cloudyness
smells
of
lemons
and
greenery
has
a
somewhat
smooth
taste
with
very
little
hops
lemon
is
detected
in
the
flavor
as
well
little
malt
all
in
all
average
best
describes
this
beer
but
make
sure
to
drink
it
when
its
cold
as
it
sours
a
bit
when
warm
notes
taste
much
like
a
corona
extra
with
a
slice
of
lime
seems
to
be
a
good
beer
to
get
drunk
by
as
its
easy
to
drink
and
all
nothing
interesting
about
the
brew
really
just
another
beer
not
bad
not
memorable
just
another
beer
notes
solid
if
unremarkable
it
was
light
and
refreshing
had
a
nice
flavor
of
wheat
with
small
hops
a
very
nice
brew
for
the
summer
months
ng
not
as
cloudy
as
the
best
white
beers
and
there
is
only
a
faint
spiciness
i
wasnt
sure
what
type
of
beer
this
was
ahead
of
time
and
couldnt
tell
from
the
smell
hints
of
yeast
and
lemon
make
me
suspect
ahh
so
its
trying
to
be
a
witbier
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
this
guy
some
lemon
more
lemon
a
little
yeast
flavor
spices
dont
let
their
presence
be
admired
not
a
very
good
witbier
but
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
offering
from
sam
adams
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
smell
is
tangy
yeast
with
a
touch
of
malts
and
lotsa
lemon
taste
is
light
grainy
maltsnot
sweet
but
a
little
medicinalfollowed
by
sharp
sour
lemon
flavor
and
a
slight
bitterness
acidic
all
the
way
with
lingering
lemon
zest
very
interesting
a
little
too
much
lemon
tartness
reminds
me
of
the
lemon
juice
in
the
fridge
i
prefer
traditional
witbiers
methinks
a
good
summer
quencher
however
brewed
with
lemon
zest
and
grains
of
paradise
as
taken
from
the
bottle
there
is
definitely
unique
taste
to
it
i
had
this
beer
at
a
bbq
on
a
hot
florida
4th
of
july
and
it
was
perfect
for
the
occasion
just
got
done
golfing
and
these
hit
the
spot
its
that
type
of
beer
i
am
actually
surprised
i
like
this
that
much
as
my
expectations
were
pretty
low
a
nice
dark
yellow
color
with
a
good
fluffy
white
head
give
it
a
whiff
and
it
smells
a
lot
like
lemons
very
light
citrus
taste
and
not
much
else
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
i
might
like
a
six
pack
of
next
to
me
on
a
beach
sitting
in
some
sun
im
not
saying
its
a
lemonade
flavored
beer
its
clearly
a
fairly
serious
ale
but
its
a
lighter
more
frivolous
ale
quite
fun
overall
a
decent
wit
but
nothing
more
this
beer
was
golden
yellow
colored
that
had
a
brown
hue
to
the
edges
it
was
cloudy
but
carbonation
bubbles
were
noticeable
it
produced
a
fluffy
white
head
that
was
thick
and
creamy
lasted
fairly
well
and
produced
a
light
lace
on
parts
of
the
inside
glass
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
light
but
i
nosed
lemon
fruit
wheat
grains
malt
and
some
spices
the
flavors
were
slightly
more
pronounced
then
the
aroma
tastes
of
light
spices
lemon
zest
bread
spices
and
malt
were
all
present
it
produced
an
aftertaste
of
mostly
bread
and
wheat
grains
it
was
light
to
medium
bodied
semi
sweet
and
semidry
on
the
pallet
seems
to
me
to
be
a
simple
wheat
beer
that
has
that
something
extra
added
to
it
but
it
was
a
crisp
clean
and
fairly
refreshing
beer
on
the
hot
day
and
that
is
what
i
needed
poured
nicely
enough
with
a
nice
white
head
that
quickly
vanished
real
lemon
smell
with
a
little
hops
thrown
in
taste
was
not
bad
but
could
only
smell
lemon
or
something
like
it
not
a
session
beer
but
good
once
in
a
while
not
worth
what
they
charge
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
probally
the
best
aspect
was
the
mouth
feel
a
lot
of
pilsner
beers
have
little
to
no
body
this
was
totally
diffrent
it
had
a
pronounced
presence
the
way
beer
should
other
than
that
this
is
a
fairly
typical
entry
however
i
would
recommend
this
to
all
the
budcoors
drinkers
i
know
yes
its
light
alright
cant
recommend
as
there
are
so
many
better
versions
of
this
style
out
there
pat
slightly
cloudy
with
creamwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
slighty
yeasty
and
slightly
citrusy
flavor
is
a
bit
on
the
tart
side
and
crisp
but
crispness
doesnt
hold
up
well
hops
dont
come
through
very
well
im
sure
this
beer
is
better
on
draught
than
bottled
this
is
about
as
good
as
bluemoons
version
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
one
this
was
a
light
bodied
beer
that
looked
nice
however
it
smelled
real
lemony
too
lemony
the
body
was
thicker
than
i
had
imagined
it
would
be
and
also
pretty
creamy
making
it
easy
to
drink
however
the
taste
was
not
too
good
but
also
not
too
bad
it
just
seemed
to
be
lacking
in
flavor
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
no
real
malt
sweetness
a
decent
brew
but
bbc
has
done
better
pours
a
hazy
golden
amber
color
with
a
tall
foamy
white
head
that
settles
into
a
creamy
lace
nose
is
grainy
with
notes
of
wheat
and
lemongrass
light
to
medium
in
body
and
slightly
chewy
in
texture
taste
is
grassy
grains
and
sweet
malt
followed
by
some
mild
spicy
notes
and
citrusy
hops
that
lead
to
an
odd
bitter
twang
and
somewhat
musty
aftertaste
seems
to
be
a
cross
between
an
american
wheat
beer
and
a
wit
beer
interesting
and
definitely
worth
a
try
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
wit
oh
please
not
that
this
is
a
horrible
beer
but
i
had
it
on
tap
and
didnt
even
realize
it
used
wheat
this
beer
tasted
to
me
just
like
a
lightened
and
citrified
is
that
a
word
regular
sam
adams
boston
lager
it
still
has
that
familiar
sam
adams
yeast
flavor
in
it
which
isnt
bad
but
there
is
nothing
witesque
about
this
one
appearance
is
way
to
clear
and
strawcolored
theres
no
spiciness
but
there
is
some
lemon
flavor
coming
through
its
a
nice
refreshing
ale
but
is
way
way
toned
down
from
the
usual
conception
of
a
belgianstyle
wit
ok
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
espn
sports
bar
one
night
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
but
i
was
also
already
intoxicated
which
may
be
the
reason
this
was
such
a
dissapointment
the
second
time
sround
pours
a
nice
somewhat
deep
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
smells
like
lemons
with
a
hint
of
spice
taste
ugh
it
tastes
like
an
average
beer
that
someone
squeezed
a
bunch
of
lemon
juice
into
its
not
horrible
but
it
is
pretty
crappy
it
just
has
this
weird
off
taste
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
light
and
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
i
would
drink
one
if
it
was
the
only
thing
around
2
if
a
gun
was
pointed
at
me
i
am
trying
to
be
objective
and
i
can
understand
that
some
people
will
enjoy
this
ale
i
am
sure
much
effort
went
in
to
creating
it
bleack
just
not
my
style
of
beer
someone
else

there
is

lingers
on
the
tongue

after
you
finish
not
a
great
beer
but
not
all
that
bad
either
when
i
poured
this
brew
into
my
glass
it
poured
a
medium
white
creamy
head
with
small
bubbles
the
body
was
cloudy
and
the
hue
was
orange
the
lacing
was
excellent

sides
of
my

it
had
a
light
malty
and
lemon
aroma
the
palate
was
light
and
creamy
this
brew
also
had
a
sweet
flavor
to
it
this
beer
has
a
slightly
citric
aroma
the
flavors
is
faitn
with
a
very
light
wheat
flavor
its
a
bit
bland
its
very
easy
drinking
which
i
guess
is
appropriate
for
the
season
but
i
kind
of
like
even
my
summer
beers
to
have
more
flavor
this
brew
poured

it
it

somewhat
bitter

with
an

think
its
a

drinkable
alei
think
a
bit
underrated
this
wheat
ale
had
a
cloudy
orange
appearance
with
a
very
small
head
and
little
to
no
lacing
a
fruity
scent
of
citrus
faint
spices
and
some
traces
of
wheat
was
rather
pleasant
but
overall
fairly
average
for
the
style
while
the
taste
too
was
only
average
for
a
wheat
beer
i
rather
enjoyed
the
fruity
and
citric
characteristics
the
malt
and
hop
balance
was
nice
too
the
mouthfeel
was
just
right
for
the
style
medium
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
and
feel
the
summer
ale
was
very
refreshing
on
this
summer
evening
while
id
opt
for
a
better
wheat
beer
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
makes
for
a
interesting
and
fruity
substitute
tasted

a
nice
cloudy
ale
with
a
white
head
this
does
look
a
little
different
than
your
average
summer
ale
the
aroma
was
nice
a
lemony
sweetness
with
maybe
some
other
citrus
as
well
taste
was
fine
a
little
more
on
the
malty
side
then
i
would
have
expected
whatever
slight
bite
this
beer
has
is
gone
by
the
third
sip
overall
a
good
light
summer
ale
probably
also
a
beer
to
serve
to
friends
who
do
not
have
that
much
experience
with
wheat
ales

potential
to
be

spicy
with

flavor
it
is
light

not
as
smooth
as
i
was
expecting
this
one
just
does
not
stand
out
in
any
area
fairly
thin
on
the
aroma
not
really
anything
too
much
to
speak
of
taste
has
a
little

to
it

no
real
hoppiness
to
it
didnt
really
taste
the
citrus
that
they
claim
to
be
in
it
it
is
a
bit
refreshing
good
but
a
little
thin
on
flavor
i
expect
something
from
sam
to
have
a
little
more
body
best
described
as
a
chick
beer
ok
this
was
available
at
the
local
corner
grocery
store
i
was
looking
for
a
filler
beer
to
have
a
few
without
tapping
into
my
special
stuff
the
bottle
is
marked
as
good
until
sep
03
i
didnt
bother
to
do
a
full
review
except
for
the
taste
i
was
hoping
for
more
grain
flavor
or
at
least
a
little
lemon
i
got
a
very
bland
beer
without
much
flavor
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
disappointing
it
was
overly
carbonated
this
combined
with
the
dry
flavor
to
not
be
very
refreshing
at
all
my
patience
is
wearing
as
thin
as
this
beer
with
sam
adams
not
sure
why
my
sample
was
more
carbonated
than
other
reviews
appearance
was
a
nice
cloudy
gold
i
drank
this
offering
a
bit
warm
so
my
review
may
change
a
bit
when
i
try
a
cold
one
the
smell
was
a
tad
fruity
but
a
bit
off
on
aroma
taste
was
ok
but
not
as
fullbodied
and
robust
as
i
would
have
liked
mothfeel
also
was
ok
but
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
average
drinkability
will
evaluate
once
again
under
colder
circumstances
pours
a
pale
hazy
golden
color
aroma
is
lemony
and
spicy
the
taste
is
citrusy
but
seems
a
little
waterdowned
not
much
flavor
here
at
all
it
seems
like
theyre
trying
to
make
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
but
are
also
trying
to
cater
to
the
average
drinker
by
making
it
a
little
bland
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
this
is
a
tasty
beer
good
for
summer
this
is
one
of
my
summer
standbys
good
drinakability
in
context
of
summer
this
is
a
decent
summer
beer
nothing
truly
fantastic
about
it
but
good
overall
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
crisp
white
head
the
aromas
are
light
and
citrusy
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
also
very
light
with
a
hint
of
yeatiness
but
a
strong
lemon
note
mouthfeel
is
decent
sort
of
light
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
good
serve
this
with
some
salmon
or
a
nice
summer
salad
or
just
swig
one
down
after
mowing
the
lawn
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
is
good
for
the
summer
months
happy
drinking
sam
summer
has
lost
alot
of
appeal
to
me
the
past
few
years
thanks
to
bolder
statements
made
by
other
summer
micros
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
great
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
colour
with
a
surprisingly
strong
head
smells
of
citrus
with
a
lemony
taste
to
it
the
problem
here
is
that
this
brew
isnt
anything
daring
at
times
it
even
tastes
a
bit
watered
down
thanks
to
its
widespread
availability
it
is
usually
a
summer
staple
but
its
nothing
grand
overall
certainly
a
refreshing
addition
to
sammys
line
up
not
as
good
as
the
vienna
or
oktoberfest
but
certainly
a
top
3
from
this
brewery
pours
out
a
cloudy
hazy
yellow
with
a
medium
froth
aroma
of
floral
hops
a
slight
lemon
twist
and
a
wheaty
grain
taste
is
smooth
hoppy
a
bit
of
malt
but
not
much
and
a
slight
yeast
aftertaste
easily
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
summertime
classic
a
nice
summer
brew
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
pours
to
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
haze
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
sits
on
top
nice
belgian
lace
taste
is
pretty
straight
forward
lemony
spice
with
a
slight
hop
kick
i
think
that
its
missing
something
though
on
another
note
the
artwork
on
the
summer
ale
label
is
what
lead
me
to
become
a
collector
of
bottle
labels
the
picture
along
with
the
beer
are
the
quintisential
evocation
of
summer
bright
full
of
wind
and
sails
and
ocean
comes
out
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
golden
in
color
it
is
a
bit
on
the
cloudy
side
tastes
pretty
grainy
very
much
like
most
wheat
beers
that
i
have
had
the
bottle
claims
to
contain
a
lemon
zest
and
i
can
verify
this
i
dont
think
this
is
a
bad
beer
it
will
serve
better
under
a
nice
hot
sun
if
you
havent
had
it
give
it
a
go
i
think
i
would
grow
tired
of
this
after
one
or
two
so
the
drinkability
suffers
on
tap
color
is
a
pale
dark
yelloworange
with
a
big
creamy
heavy
white
froth
about
an
inch
high
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
smells
mostly
of
lemon
citrus
and
wheat
grain
malt
notes
taste
is
about
the
same
as
the
smell
with
a
soild
lemony
citrus
flavor
fairly
smooth
and
a
light
and
bright
hop
with
some
wheaty
yeastness
thats
a
little
uneven
but
still
pretty
good
drinking
for
a
summer
soother
feels
medium
body
sort
of
grainy
and
bittering
of
lemon
peels
in
the
holding
finish
its
pretty
good
and
refreshing
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
on
a
hot
day
its
murky
yellowburnt
orange
in
color
with
a
very
large
fluffy
white
head
that
forms
a
thick
coating
after
a
few
minutes
lemon
citrus
and
wheat
are
all
in
the
aroma
lemon
being
the
strongest
this
is
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
lemon
flavor
mixed
with
a
pleasant
maltiness
and
graininess
the
finish
and
aftertaste
have
a
spicy
hop
character
with
a
slightly
annoying
lemon
tartness
overall
its
a
very
refreshing
warm
weather
beer
a
nice
refreshing
beer
from
sam
this
came
from
the
tap
a
cloudy
light
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
it
held
the
head
for
a
while
and
laced
quite
nicely
the
beer
smelled
fresh
and
clean
and
tasted
the
same
mostly
a
bready
sense
with
some
nice
light
citrus
overlay
the
feel
was
fairly
light
bodied
and
crisp
in
the
finish
this
seems
as
if
it
could
be
a
good
beer
for
a
long
haul
nice
not
very
fond
of
this
one
cloudy
yellow
with
a
decent
head
but
has
a
bitter
sour
lemony
taste
refreshing
for
a
few
sips
but
then
difficult
to
get
past
admittedly
i
am
not
a
fan
of
summer
brews
or
tangy
beers
still
it
would
have
to
be
very
hot
in
order
for
me
to
want
another
of
these
this
beer
pours
with
an
orangish
golden
tone
with
a
nice
frothing
orangish
white
head
that
left
me
relatively
quickly
another
sorry
attempt
for
sam
adams
to
make
a
classic
style
its
not
horrible
its
just
sammed
out
has
the
same
background
flavors
as
many
of
their
beers
which
i
am
not
crazy
about
the
aroma
is
full
of
the
lemon
zest
aroma
that
is
nice
but
the
beer
shouldnt
just
have
the
bitter
taste
of
lemon
zest
it
cancels
out
the
pleasure
of
the
smell
when
you
taste
the
bitter
offness
of
the
lemon
zest
overall
not
very
drinkable
or
enjoyable
for
me
i
dont
consider
this
a
true
witte
bit
if
i
did
it
would
be
on
the
bottom
of
the
wittes
i
have
tried
will
not
go
for
this
one
again
taste
is
wheat
at
first
with
a
lemon
at
the
end
a
dry
crisp
finish
at
the
end
this
is
a
lite
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
seems
like
i
can
drink
it
forever
i
enjoyed
the
bit
of
lemon
zest
in
the
flavor
compared
to
the
other
beers
that
i
have
had
in
this
category
this
is
a
light
bit
above
average
the
pours
a
cloudless
golden
amber
color
the
head
generous
in
it
presence
bright
white
in
color
and
the
lace
nice
sheets
to
cover
the
glass
malt
dominates
crisp
and
citrus
fresh
quite
nice
nose
the
start
malt
and
lightly
sweet
the
top
skinny
in
feel
finish
is
tartly
acidic
hops
quite
pleasant
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
long
lasting
another
good
everyday
drinking
beer
well
at
least
during
the
summer
a
pretty
good
stab
at
the
belgian
white
style
by
samuel
adams
although
this
beer
poured
a
wonderful
colour
it
did
not
really
have
the
head
retention
that
white
style
beers
are
generally
known
for
also
this
beer
did
not
have
a
very
pungent
aroma
or
strong
taste
but
what
it
did
have
was
good
still
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
job
by
sam
adams
on
this
one
rather
malty
for
a
wit
beer
the
golden
color
is
attractive
but
the
head
doesnt
last
anything
like
the
head
of
hoegarrden
does
i
liked
the
lemon
scent
was
different
and
alluring
of
the
barrel
of
wit
beers
ive
tried
this
would
be
on
the
bottom
but
it
is
still
a
solid
beer
good
just
not
great
the
yellow
label
says
it
all
this
stuff
is
just
plain
bad
a
copper
hued
beer
the
citris
just
overpowers
the
hops
and
malts
on
my
palate
if
i
wanted
a
corona
i
would
just
drink
one
bbc
should
not
just
brew
a
beer
to
get
into
a
niche
market
without
any
thought
2002
edition
copper
color
and
a
big
white
head
which
takes
a
while
to
go
down
and
leaves
some
lace
defined
lemony
aroma
with
wheatlike
malt
character
supporting
it
lemon
and
spicy
hop
bitterness
combine
in
the
taste
and
overpower
the
wheatlike
maltiness
i
find
the
lemon
in
this
a
bit
out
of
place
and
overpowering
it
seems
to
kill
the
other
characteristics
of
this
brew
this
is
definitely
not
what
id
judge
this
company
by
in
fact
im
surprised
i
usually
love
sam
adams
beers
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
style
beers
but
this
one
is
ok
personally
for
a
summer
quencher
i
prefer
a
light
lager
like
yuengling
premium
for
a
wheat
ale
while
refreshing
and
very
tasty
i
find
it
is
lacking
in
the
characteristics
of
the
same
most
of
the
taste
is
masked
by
the
lemon
zest
which
is
ok
for
a
nice
summer
beverage
though
i
would
have
preferred
that
at
least
some
of
the
tart
taste
came
from
the
wheat
malt
fairly
busy
aroma
with
aspects
of
wheat
malt
lemon
and
other
fruitiness
but
also
a
characteristic
sam
adams
quality
head
a
little
thin
and
not
that
persistent
gold
with
mild
cloudiness
drink
has
a
nice
thirst
quenching
quality
and
a
flavor
that
while
mild
holds
many
tastes
including
the
base
of
wheat
but
also
some
citrus
acidity
and
a
little
sourness
fullness
in
the
mouthfeel
from
richness
and
carbonation
dryness
to
finish
but
not
bitter
i
dont
know
that
i
would
pick
this
all
the
time
but
its
a
nice
offering
and
presents
several
interesting
components
i
am
not
a
bg
fan
of
many
wheat
beers
and
this
is
a
solid
middleroad
offering
dig
it
if
you
like
the
wheatsummers
otherwise
not
much
to
offer
sam
is
still
boss
regardless
cheers

than
i
expected
for
a

creamy
head
that
settles
at
14
of
an
inch

flavor
has
a
deep
character
an
interesting

combined
with
citron
and
a
trace
of

transforms
to
a
twang
of

at

nice
swap
of
flavors
i
actually
like
this
better
than
more
accurate
representatives
for
style
thanks
sammy
for
a
more
interesting
summer
brew
than
most
wouldnt
be
bad
to
down
quickly
in
the
summer
sun
but
not
something
i
would
make
a
session
of
ill
take
a
traditional
wit
thank
you
based
on
appearances
this
would
have
been
a
great
beer
for
me
dark
golden
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
looked
very
attractive
however
i
thought
it
had
a
very
hoppy
bitter
aftertaste
that
didnt
quite
agree
with
me
hint
of
lemon
apparent
in
both
smell
and
taste
i
must
note
that
i
had
this
after
another
beer
of
a
very
different
style
so
i
will
definitely
try
again
to
see
if
anything
changes
prosit
good
stuff
a
great
summer
brew
it
is
second
on
my
list
to
petes
a
kick
of
lemon
goes
down
very
crisp
clean
and
smooth
perfect
for
a
barbeque
on
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
hazy
gold
color
rocky
tight
sticky
off
white
head
aroma
suggests
lemons
peppery
spiciness
flavor
delivers
much
of
same
with
some
prickly
hops
smooth
lightmedium
bodied
mouthfeel
it
also
sort
of
defies
catagorization
probably
falls
somewhere
between
a
belgian
wit
and
a
hearty
american
wheat
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
as
normally
i
find
summer
brews
lacking
flavor
and
substance
an
excellent
summertime
thirst
quencher
interesting
beer
cheers
to
sa
for
creating
a
unique
and
inspired
summer
brew
i
was
skeptical
as
this
was
not
my
usual
style
but
i
promised
myself
that
id
be
objective
wow
i
didnt
have
to
be
simply
objective
i
loved
it
this
yellowish
wheat
has
a
slight
orangish
haze
appearance
is
appropriate
for
the
style
the
head
is
thick
and
white
retention
is
good
and
head
life
is
average
the
smell
is
lemony
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
starts
lemony
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
the
wheat
hop
hits
you
but
then
finishes
out
crisp
and
refreshing
hazy
deep
golden
color
almost
copperish
nice
rocky
head
that
laces
down
the
glass
definite
lemonypeppery
aroma
taste
is
ever
so
slightly
complex
teasing
me
with
citrus
wheat
malt
and
spice
it
leaves
me
longing
for
more
but
i
shouldnt
complain
a
hop
bite
in
the
end
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
a
very
refreshing
brew
that
is
light
enough
for
the
summer
season
would
be
great
with
some
spicy
barbeque
surprisingly
refreshing
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
3
finger
head
its
aroma
is
slightly
weaker
but
consistent
with
its
taste
the
taste
is
that
of
a
mild
wheat
and
a
fairly
nice
balance
of
hops
and
with
alcohol
on
the
tip
of
the
tail
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
nice
for
the
hot
summer
days
here
in
texas
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
for
the
sale
price
of
3
99
per
six
you
cant
beat
it
cheers
i
had
visions
of
lemon
pledge
before
trying
this
but
it
actually
worked
well
on
this
brew
not
a
favorite
but
i
can
see
it
being
refreshing
after
a
lawn
mowing
nice
golden
color
and
a
citrusy
aroma
not
a
bad
brew
from
sam
adams
i
saw
it
on
tap
and
was
hesitant
but
tried
it
anyway
it
is
quite
murky
with
a
nice
aroma
the
first
taste
of
this
brew
offers
a
sample
of
things
to
come
tis
is
a
nice
and
refreshing
summer
ale
the
surprise
is
the
hints
of
earthiness
within
it
when
i
say
that
i
mean
wheat
in
this
case
not
too
overpowering
but
it
is
there
a
very
nice
beer
from
start
to
finish
pours
a
cloudy
light
amber
beer
with
a
creamy
white
lace
that
sticks
and
retains
well
aroma
is
grainy
spicy
and
citric
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
coarse
flavour
contains
dry
crisp
grain
lemon
zest
that
lends
a
nice
sharp
bitter
twang
and
a
soft
touch
of
caramel
and
malt
sweetness
finish
is
grainy
faint
musty
yeast
and
dry
with
grain
tannins
beautiful
color
and
dangerously
drinkable
carbonation
was
good
but
smell
was
unremarkable
taste
is
refreshingly
lighta
good
summer
beer
if
this
beer
shows
up
at
a
cookout
im
a
happy
guy
hazy
orange
body
with
nice

rocky
white

lemons

tangy

taste
wheat
and

dominate
taste
hops
and
lemon
are
secondary
lemon
slightly
more
prevalent
in
aftertaste
an
ok
summer
quencher
but
i
would
prefer
to
have
the
spring
ale
available
until
octoberfest
colder
is
better
i
had
one
at
about
60
degrees
and
didnt
care
for
it
i
thought
it
was
the
wheat
i
cooled
one
to
45
like
sam
saysto
iwaited
for
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
grass
imagine
thisitwas
good
stuff
crispdrinkable
and
very
refreshing
the
lemon
is
justrite
for
summer
a
quality
brew
as
can
be
expected
from
sam
adams
but
one
which
i
am
personally
not
fond
of
the
grains
of
paradise
might
be
interesting
in
a
different
brew
but
the
sour
lemon
turned
me
off
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
simply
as
a
matter
of
personal
preference
others
may
enjoy
it
in
all
aspects
you
get
a
well
crafted
brew
aromas
of
whole
wheat
spurced
up
with
a
strong
lemony
note
very
pleasing
for
the
palate
smooth
and
light
bodied
soothing
a
true
summer
delight
in
every
respect
not
that
good
kind
of
boring
really
especially
for
a
wheat
beer
it
pretty
much
had
zero
flavour
except
for
a
bit
of
maltiness
in
the
middle
this
beer
is
somewhat
cloudy
golden
in
color
with
a
smell
of
lemongrass
the
smell
reminds
me
somewhat
of
a
seaside
ocean
grass
waving
in
the
wind
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
spice
chewey
mouthfeel
an
all
around
compotent
ale
just
an
ok
beer
i
really
liked
it
much
better
last
summer
before
my
beer
exploration
really
started
better
than
average
yellow
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
i
expected
a
little
stronger
citrus
floral
smell
tasted
nice
and
fuzzy
like
i
remember
but
maybe
should
be
a
little
crisper
more
hops
for
a
summer
beer
still
an
easy
to
drink
refreshing
summer
thirst
quencher
easy
to
get
non
bas
to
try
one
i
had
it
at
the
atlanta
airport
samuel
adams
brewpub
that
could
have
effected
the
review
i
think
the
allagash
is
better
in
this
style
im
not
he
biggest
fan
of
grains
of
paradise
but
this
is
a
decent
fullflavored
wheat
beer
that
id
pick
over
many
other
brewers
summer
offerings
and
fortunately
a
lot
of
nonbeer
geek
people
have
this
on
hand
in
the
summer
thats
not
such
a
bad
thing
cloudy
golden
colored
beer
with
a
thick
white
head
perceptible
citrus
aroma
and
taste
also
has
perceptible
light
hopping
and
wheat
character
very
pleasant
on
a
sunny
spring
day
i
was
pretty
excited
to
see
a
sam
adams
belgian
wit
style
brew
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
this
just
doesnt
get
the
job
done
for
that
i
really
have
no
idea
what
grains
of
paradise
are
and
i
dont
really
detect
any
spice
in
this
beer
to
speak
of
nevertheless
its
a
very
enjoyable
easydrinker
enough
hoppiness
to
give
it
a
good
dry
finish
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
sweetness
from
the
wheat
and
a
soft
persistent
head
and
lace
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
found
it
quite
tasty
probably
great
with
barbecue
or
mexican
food
its
just
not
really
what
i
was
hoping
for
in
a
belgian
wit
style
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
of
this
because
the
pour
gave
no
head
like
a
date
with
a
nun
the
taste
was
nothing
to
write
home
about
either
another
example
on
why
i
stockpile
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
for
when
this
time
a
year
roles
around
pours
hazy
light
golden
with
a
sticky
white
head
nice
aroma
of
malted
wheat
and
vanilla
nice
malty
wheat
backbone
tangy
taste
a
bit
of
lemon
i
do
get
somewhat
of
a
bite
in
this
one
too
similar
to
the
nice
hop
bite
youll
find
in
properly
brewed
european
pilseners
but
not
as
harsh
a
case
of
these
would
be
a
nice
way
to
fill
up
the
poolside
cooler
cool
winslow
homer
on
the
bottle
though
is
this
actually
supposed
to
be
a
wit
pours
a
perfectly
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
whit
head
that
sticks
around
nicely
smell
is
very
weak
and
almost
completely
of
lemon
faint
wheat
and
yeast
aromas
there
is
so
much
lemon
in
this
brew
that
it
almost
makes
my
mouth
pucker
when
i
drink
it
there
are
some
vague
wheat
flavors
in
the
brew
and
no
discernable
yeast
or
spice
flavors
somewhat
creamy
but
not
nearly
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
somewhat
drinkable
when
coors
can
make
a
better
wit
blue
moon
than
sam
adams
something
is
very
wrong
i
more
than
likely
wont
purchase
this
again
pours
an
offwhite
cloudy
color
on
the
nose
there
is
aromas
of
wheat
malt
and
lemon
zest
the
same
two
things
lemon
and
wheat
malt
on
the
palate
too
im
not
a
big
on
wheats
but
2
or
3
on
a
nice
warm
day
served
ice
cold
does
the
trick
nice
summer
quencher
i
actually
prefer
to
be
eating
something
while
drinking
these
types
of
beers
but
overall
not
to
shabby
for
a
wheat
brew
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
decent
and
rather
sticky
white
head
and
moderate
lace
strong
aromas
of
wheat
lemon
and
spices
upon
tasting
malt
notes
assert
themselves
very
briefly
followed
by
lemon
and
spices
and
a
hoppy
finish
a
refreshing
summer
beer
attractive
and
dense
white
head
cloudy
light
orange
in
hue
grainy
lemony
slightly
phenolic
aroma
subtle
coriander
is
present
as
well
definitely
more
mild
in
aroma
that
most
wits
surprisingly
bland
in
flavor
complexity
added
by
the
yeast
is
sorely
lacking
in
this
brew
spice
flavor
is
quite
minimal
but
a
touch
of
bitter
orange
peel
is
there
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
silky
and
the
medium
body
is
perhaps
due
to
the
use
of
oats
finishes
w
wheat
tartness
w
not
much
else
a
bit
dissapointing
its
a
dumbened
down
version
of
a
wit
hand
me
a
vuuve
now
a
decent
offering
from
the
boston
beer
co
ill
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
from
time
to
time
during
the
summer
there
is
just
a
touch
too
much
lemontaste
on
the
finish
but
it
is
a
crisp
easy
to
drink
brew
the
lemon
and
wheat
work
well
against
each
other
this
is
a
refreshing
thirstquenching
beer
doesnt
do
much
to
advance
the
wit
style
in
fact
i
dont
think
it
has
much
in
common
still
a
pleasant
brew
not
one
that
bears
much
scrutiny
but
fine
for
simple
quaffing
doesnt
stand
up
to
much
in
the
way
of
flavorful
food
but
could
be
enjoyed
with
very
light
fare
like
a
salad
or
something
sam
adams
summer
ale
for
2002
considering
that
we
are
about
10
days
into
spring
around
here
seems
a
little
early
to
have
this
seasonal
released
this
is
a
wheat
beer
based
on
a
belgian
white
ale
according
to
the
label
compared
to
last
years
seems
significantly
darker
and
i
seem
to
recall
that
last
years
had
more
of
a
weiss
haze
white
dense
head
very
pronounced
lemon
aroma
and
taste
ill
enjoy
this
beer
all
summer
long
mmmmm
summer
beers
nothing
like
watching
a
redsox
game
and
knocking
back
a
couple
of
em
i
have
two
summer
ale
favourites
and
this
is
definatley
one
of
them
good
bbq
beer
i
probably
would
have
liked
this
ale
more
if
the
label
had
not
lead
me
to
expect
a
spiced
white
ale
overall
it
seemed
too
restrained
what
the
heck
are
grains
of
paradise
anyway
this
was
my
favorite
wheat
beer
for
the
longest
time
it
was
also
my
first
i
havent
had
it
in
forever
so
my
points
for
it
go
to
nostalgia
but
i
know
id
still
like
it
if
i
drank
one
now
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
an
alright
beer
but
nothing
to
call
home
about
this
is
one
of
my
lesser
favorites
that
sam
adams
produces
even
so
it
is
not
a
bad
brew
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
but
it
was
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
it
pours
up
a
pale
straw
with
a
two
finger
white
head
which
stays
around
for
awhile
it
doesnt
leave
a
whole
lot
of
lacing
though
the
smell
is
lemon
banana
and
honey
taste
is
fairly
mild
and
mostly
follows
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
okay
with
some
nice
carbonation
really
an
okay
beer
o
profile
is
much
more
like
a
hefeweizen
not
a
beer
style
i
seek
out
but
even
so
disappointing
o
a
not
bad
but
unexciting
wheat
beer
pretty
thin
and
light
and
refreshing
but
really
boring
overall
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
pale
slightly
hazed
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
filmy
white
coating
on
the
surface
aromas
of
lemon
banana
and
berries
mix
with
some
minty
and
herbal
highlights
flavors
are
more
malty
than
you
would
expect
with
a
buttery
and
slightly
toffee
backbone
the
herbs
come
forward
again
this
time
as
a
slightly
strong
highlight
overall
the
flavors
are
a
bit
all
over
the
place
they
stumble
into
a
lemony
sharp
muddled
aftertaste
slick
slightly
oily
finish
this
was
not
a
good
brew
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
overall
i
really
like
coastal
wheat
far
from
my
favorite
sam
adams
beer
but
ill
have
no
problem
drinking
the
other
thats
in
the
sixpack
another
good
offering
from
s
a
boring
ol
yellowish
clear
white
head
of
1
finger
and
little
to
no
lacing
just
the
same
ol
boring
taste
feel
and
finish
could
have
just
as
well
had
a
boring
miller
lite
yes
this
beer
was
that
terrible
to
my
taste
buds
not
much
flavor
nor
any
thing
good
i
dont
see
why
sam
adams
keeps
this
going
with
the
similar
and
better
summer
ale
available
probably
wont
purchase
again
rjt
this
is
a
yellowgold
colored
beer
with
a
faint
haze
white
head
that
is
a
little
smaller
than
expected
the
aroma
is
muted
but
has
the
usual
wheat
twang
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
meaty
citrus
flowers
and
yeast
its
both
tart
sweet
and
fruity
refreshing
medium
in
body
crisp
clean
finish
good
overall
summertime
brew
not
a
bad
wheat
ale
the
bicoastal
nature
a
decent
idea
another
goodn
for
sipping
away
lazily
after
too
much
time
in
the
pacific
sun
woe
is
me
this
wheat
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
orange
gold
color
from
a
12oz
bottle
no
noticeable
sediment
small
quickly
diminishing
white
foamy
head
without
much
lacing
odd
for
a
wheat
beer
it
seems
the
aroma
is
flour
cereal
and
lemon
drop
medium
bodied
the
malts
are
cereal
and
wheaty
herbal
hops
not
that
much
like
claimed
hefeweisen
as
claimed
little
banana
and
clove
not
as
smooth
either
more
tart
and
sour
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
an
interesting
wheat
beer
not
my
favorite
bbc
offering
but
solid
o
decent
for
the
style
but
i
couldnt
get
into
this
one
o
dominated
by
lemon
this
almost
tastes
like
a
radler
instead
of
a
wheat
beer
the
wheat
and
coriander
make
their
way
into
the
taste
but
are
almost
completely
shut
out
of
the
nose
make
this
a
little
more
balanced
and
this
could
be
better
than
just
average
this
was
bad
it
had
such
a
foul
sour
tart
flavor
that
was
completely
unwelcome
i
will
never
get
this
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
decent
flavor
but
it
looks
rather
bland
o
good
for
a
wheat
beer
pretty
close
to
a
hefeminus
the
banana
notes
ov
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
the
citrus
notes
are
mild
and
the
wheat
adds
just
a
mild
layer
of
complexity
i
find
this
more
engaging
than
a
blue
moon
it
doesnt
have
any
icky
syruplike
texture
very
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
mild
honeylike
character
would
drink
again
cheers
oanother
poor
fruit
beer
from
sa
so
far
only
their
blackberry
is
decent
maybe
they
should
stop
putting
fruit
in
beer
overall
this
beer
turned
out
better
than
expected
from
my
initial
judgement
on
its
appearance
not
necessarily
seeking
this
out
in
the
future
but
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
another
pours
a
hazy
golden
from
the
bottle
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
hay
wheat
some
honey
and
very
very
mild
citrus
a
bit
of
yeast
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
plenty
of
hay
and
yeast
but
only
a
brief
influence
from
the
citrus
a
bit
light
on
the
palate
in
a
watered
down
way
rather
than
a
light
carbonated
way
this
comes
off
as
a
little
stale
in
the
finish
as
many
wheat
beers
do
overall
id
drink
it
again
if
around
but
would
not
buy
it
off
a
shelf
with
all
the
other
options
o
this
would
be
very
good
on
a
hot
day
but
i
could
only
drink
one
and
it
isnt
something
i
would
really
reach
for
over
other
beers
pleasant
enough
but
nothing
special
poured
a
one
inch
custard
head
which
faded
after
a
minute
the
body
is
a
hazy
raw
sienna
yellow
color
smell
is
surprisingly
rich
with
malt
for
the
style
and
i
dont
get
any
of
the
citrus
but
then
the
taste
reverses
with
lemon
up
front
and
just
a
mild
aftertaste
of
malt
its
mildly
sweet
and
has
a
slight
acidic
zing
quite
frankly
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
overall
not
a
bad
taste
but
a
little
spicier
than
i
enjoy
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
im
kinda
losing
faith
in
good
ol
uncle
sam
overallnot
impressed
the
lemon
notes
are
overwhelming
and
do
not
work
well
with
this
beer
50
poured
very
light
gold
with
visible
carbonation
but
a
small
head
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
pretty
nonexistent
and
could
use
more
power
but
i
actually
quite
liked
the
tasteits
not
very
strong
as
far
as
wheat
goes
but
the
lemon
is
obviously
natural
it
blends
nicely
with
the
wheat
and
there
is
some
exciting
spice
which
i
believe
theyve
added
to
the
brew
hops
are
earthy
and
offer
a
good
contrast
to
the
lemon
i
was
surprised
by
how
wintery
it
felt
once
i
was
drinking
ita
spicy
muted
summer
exactly
what
i
want
when
theres
a
blizzard
outside
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
way
to
sweet
and
chewing
gum
flavor
really
throws
me
off
this
is
an
easy
drinker
with
nice
citrus
notes
that
i
could
consume
several
of
and
not
be
put
off
by
but
as
far
as
style
goes
i
think
it
falls
short
with
the
wheat
grain
bill
being
to
low
as
well
as
the
bitterness
o
a
decent
beer
would
be
good
to
get
someone
into
the
wheat
style
of
beer
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
poured
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
small
watery
head
smell
was
a
dry
lemony
mix
as
was
the
taste
lemon
and
wheat
were
balanced
out
fairly
good
dryer
finish
with
wheat
still
lingering
around
in
the
aftertaste
pretty
decent
beer
with
the
lemon
twist
added
i
like
most
of
sam
adams
offerings
and
this
wasnt
bad
but
not
stellar
by
any
stretch
o
i
think
sam
adams
has
made
better
beers
but
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
not
very
good
dont
waste
a
purchase
i
had
to
dig
at
the
store
to
get
to
this
beer
so
it
might
be
a
bit
old
but
it
shouldnt
be
out
of
date
either
way
it
was
no
good
ive
had
two
disappointing
beers
tonight
this
came
in
a
sampler
pack
so
im
not
too
upset
but
i
would
never
pay
for
this
on
its
own
o
not
one
i
would
personally
buy
again
i
still
remain
a
fan
of
sam
adams
but
dont
feel
this
one
belongs
in
their
lineup
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
is
the
nice
clean
citrusy
aroma
the
body
is
a
nice
burnt
gold
color
and
is
slightly
hazy
but
the
carbonation
is
clearly
visible
its
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
and
is
very
bubbly
and
frothy
but
doesnt
last
long
there
is
some
mild
lacing
too
strong
citrus
aromas
like
oranges
and
lemons
come
through
but
i
also
pick
up
some
apple
and
mild
wheat
his
beer
is
light
bodied
and
slightly
bitter
overall
but
it
is
crisp
and
goes
down
smooth
citrus
flavors
are
very
present
but
not
much
else
there
is
a
slight
tart
aftertaste
when
you
swallow
this
beer
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
definitely
looks
better
than
it
tastes
overall
not
my
favorite
sa
brew
this
is
some
serious
weak
sauce
i
guess
if
you
were
reeeaally
thirsty
and
it
was
a
reeeaally
hot
day
this
would
be
enticing
but
so
would
lemonade
drink
a
glass
of
ice
water
instead
and
save
the
beer
calories
for
something
with
flavour
i
liked
the
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
and
it
is
very
like
the
beer
im
used
to
drinking
i
think
sam
adams
does
very
well
with
this
beer
i
think
i
would
buy
this
again
sometime
has
a
fairly
robust
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
throughout
not
a
fantastic
beer
but
refreshing
nonetheless
overall
not
a
bad
brew
slightly
bland
but
not
unpleasant
would
be
a
decent
and
easy
drinking
summer
beer
o
somewhat
lost
of
an
identity
its
a
decent
beer
but
doesnt
hold
my
attention
very
long
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
better
than
the
macrobreweries
but
definitely
has
room
for
improvement
taste
is
quite
malty
the
lemon
comes
out
nicely
with
wheat
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
goes
down
easy
good
for
summer
o
pleasent
but
not
great
could
use
more
focus
on
the
wheat
malt
bill
but
on
a
summer
day
this
is
welcome
just
not
a
good
brew
by
sam
adams
cmon
guys
you
can
do
better
than
this
this
is
even
worse
than
their
summer
ale
which
is
also
way
too
lemony
avoid
unless
its
free
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
lasting
white
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
light
fruity
esters
some
light
banana
and
wheat
notes
taste
is
same
as
aroma
with
some
light
malt
and
grassy
hay
notes
light
crisp
body
and
good
carbonation
on
the
palate
light
wheat
and
fruity
notes
with
a
lingering
light
malty
taste
on
the
finish
overall
a
quite
pleasant
easy
drinking
summer
brew
o
just
an
average
beer
here
not
the
best
but
certainly
not
the
worst
thanks
1
o
overall
this
is
a
good
offering
but
not
as
flavorful
as
others
in
the
style
crisp
and
refreshing
none
the
less
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
o
not
the
worst
apwa
ive
tried
has
more
of
a
citrus
profile
than
some
and
the
heavier
mouthfeel
is
a
plus
for
me
sorry
sa
this
one
does
not
make
the
cut
overall
its
a
miss
for
me
ive
had
much
much
better
wheat
beers
and
this
is
just
flat
if
you
are
really
looking
for
taste
has
its
place
at
a
bbq
i
started
out
with
a
finger
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
but
by
the
time
i
finished
typing
the
above
it
was
down
to
wisps
that
seems
like
good
retention
in
my
book
color
was
a
cloudy
not
hazy
orangishyellow
nose
had
the
characteristic
snap
of
wheat
malt
but
i
would
have
guessed
orange
as
the
underlying
citrus
smell
vice
lemon
whoops
mouthfeel
was
relatively
full
approaching
creamy
with
a
definite
citrus
presence
but
not
a
tart
one
it
was
like
a
creamsicle
reinforcing
my
earlier
stance
on
orange
vice
lemon
finish
was
so
much
like
a
creamsicle
that
i
now
wanted
one
for
the
first
time
in
years
yay
summer
kind
of
doughy
flavored
with
the
formentioned
honey
bananna
and
lemon
a
bit
grainy
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
but
more
full
than
i
was
expecting
given
the
style
lots
of
carbonation
that
fizzes
in
the
mouth
decent
beer
to
have
if
its
available
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
overall
i
disliked
this
and
wont
get
it
again
at
least
sa
tried
something
new
its
just
one
something
i
liked
at
all
overall
the
beer
has
a
nice
refreshing
taste
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
shock
top
not
sure
that
is
a
good
thing
o
very
disappointing
for
a
samuel
adams
product
if
it
wasnt
so
bland
im
sure
i
would
enjoy
it
more
flavor
is
the
typical
sam
adams
wheat
flavor
that
many
of
their
other
beers
follow
think
white
ale
summer
ale
etc
just
with
a
bigger
blast
of
lemon
flavor
its
a
slightly
sweet
beer
not
overly
complex
or
even
all
that
flavorful
has
a
short
mildly
more
sour
lemon
finish
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
its
hot
out
so
ill
go
ahead
and
have
a
few
more
its
crisp
and
refreshing
would
stick
with
summer
ale
though
o
good
brew
but
would
be
better
with
some
more
flavor
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
offering
from
sam
adams
there
are
much
better
wheat
beers
out
there
so
dont
waste
your
money
on
this
one
ohas
a
great
color
for
its
category
fairly
good
smell
and
taste
mixed
with
a
light
body
make
this
a
decent
beer
to
enjoy
overall
i
have
to
recommend
avoiding
this
beer
sorry
sam
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
spicy
and
citrusy
this
has
a
very
strong
lemon
flavor
that
is
relatively
crisp
and
relatively
unimpressive
even
though
i
dont
particularly
like
wheat
beers
i
really
think
this
one
needs
a
lot
of
improvement
a
bit
of
haze
in
this
golden
colored
brew
fairly
small
white
head
is
pretty
sticky
nose
is
light
wheat
with
a
bit
of
lemon
light
wheat
front
some
lemon
kind
of
a
touch
of
soapy
taste
medium
bodied
pretty
smooth
but
it
does
have
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
i
dont
know
not
horrible
but
not
my
favorite
sa
summer
brew
a
good
warmer
weather
brew
its
nice
that
thisone
is
brewed
all
year
for
the
warmer
climate
areas
a
good
citric
ale
thats
not
a
summer
seasonal
m
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
generally
light
throughout
the
few
rays
of
citric
brightness
are
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
dig
this
brew
note
i
typically
despise
fruit
beers
this
is
a
pleasant
wheat
beer
with
just
the
right
hint
of
lemon
flavoring
pours
a
nice
hazy
gold
color
smell
is
of
light
wheat
and
faint
citrus
taste
follows
suit
crisp
light
and
refreshing
really
a
pretty
decent
brew
for
warmer
days
overall
uh
well
this
isnt
one
that
i
am
going
to
be
buying
again
or
will
even
recommend
to
a
wheat
beer
drinker
im
a
little
disappointed
that
the
boston
beer
company
would
put
out
something
like
this
considering
the
amount
of
good
beers
that
they
have
been
putting
out
recently
in
my
opinion
they
need
to
retire
this
one
and
head
back
to
the
drawing
board
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
colorthat
leads
to
an
aroma
of
bread
citrus
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
mainly
citrus
with
notes
of
honey
spice
and
caramel
its
got
a
medium
mouthfeel
fairly
thick
for
a
wheat
beer
filling
samuel
adams
coastal
wheat
is
an
okay
beer
slightly
recommended
overall
not
a
whole
lot
of
dimension
to
this
but
it
is
very
good
it
makes
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
theres
a
good
chance
i
would
buy
this
again
a
note
im
still
a
little
surprised
at
the
flavor
given
the
way
it
was
described
at
the
boston
beer
company
brewery
tour
they
said
that
since
plenty
of
people
were
putting
lemons
with
the
hefeweizen
they
took
that
and
used
it
to
develop
a
recipe
with
lemon
peels
added
so
i
was
expecting
more
hefeweizen
flavor
in
it
not
disappointed
with
the
result
given
this
beer
is
without
a
doubt
a
summer
time
brew
i
poured
this
into
a
regular
pint
glass
and
it
was
a
really
nice
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
screams
lemon
and
has
the
softness
of
the
wheat
in
there
too
smells
almost
like
a
weak
lemonade
the
flavor
is
packed
with
lemon
zest
upfront
then
it
fades
to
a
nice
wheat
backbone
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
like
a
wheat
beer
usually
is
overall
its
a
decent
brew
when
in
season
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
american
pale
wheat
ale
poured
a
pale
straw
color
it
was
a
little
hazy
it
produced
a
nice
white
head
and
it
had
average
head
retention
the
aroma
of
the
ale
was
dominated
by
lemons
and
yeast
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
it
is
has
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
is
fairly
drinkable
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
what
you
expect
from
a
pale
wheat
ale
the
lemons
add
an
amount
of
character
to
it
but
it
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
i
think
there
is
almost
to
much
of
a
lemon
flavor
for
this
beer
this
beer
is
merely
average
not
one
of
boston
beer
companys
best
works
but
it
will
do
for
this
early
spring
afternoon
overall
best
sam
adams
ive
tried
thus
far
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
this
beer
again
in
the
future
overall
drinkability
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
didnt
leave
feeling
particularly
disappointed
got
what
i
expected
overall
a
light
beer
with
smooth
and
petite
flavor
call
me
provincial
but
i
usually
prefer
my
wheat
from
the
more
internal
parts
o
countries
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
shortlived
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
chalky
wheat
light
lemon
peel
very
light
coriander
and
a
firm
touch
of
banana
something
seems
vaguely
off
though
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
its
not
entirely
either
pleasant
or
un
the
taste
follows
kinda
closely
replacing
the
lemon
peel
with
some
orange
zest
and
replacing
the
banana
with
some
rater
irony
hard
water
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
very
meek
little
beer
something
that
theoretically
could
be
easy
to
drink
but
not
necessarily
something
that
would
elicit
a
desire
to
do
so
d
its
an
ok
beer
but
it
just
comes
out
as
light
i
would
say
this
beer
would
be
better
during
the
summer
monthes
overall
for
what
boston
brewing
co
was
going
for
i
think
they
made
a
successful
brew
a
lower
abv
may
force
me
to
give
a
higher
grade
o
this
brew
is
a
little
to
sweet
for
my
taste
not
terrible
but
it
would
not
be
my
go
to
wheat
thats
for
sure
love
this
as
a
late
spring
early
summer
type
of
ale
the
lemon
zest
is
not
overpowering
but
absolutely
noticeable
not
as
hazy
as
some
wheat
ales
but
this
is
not
one
of
my
prerequisites
overall
i
would
recommend
this
very
drinkable
beer
samuel
adams
strikes
again
i
was
surprised
how
clear
this
beer
was
bottle
says
hazy
but
not
as
hazy
as
a
wheat
should
be
pale
yellow
and
clear
tasted
very
light
light
body
easy
to
drink
overall
not
too
impressed
easy
drinking
beer
may
be
good
to
watch
a
ball
game
or
out
grilling
poured
a
hazy
yellow
in
color
with
a
large
frothy
white
head
that
was
mostly
lasting
with
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
straw
like
malts
citrus
hops
with
a
heavy
odor
of
yeast
it
tasted
of
lemons
and
yeast
with
an
light
bitter
lemon
aftertaste
that
dissapeared
quickly
mouthfeel
was
very
light
with
a
dry
texture
overall
an
average
wheat
beer
this
is
without
a
doubt
an
above
average
tasting
wheat
beer
something
imo
rare
for
sam
adams
but
the
mouth
feel
and
the
way
it
all
goes
together
is
rather
disappointing
ive
always
felt
that
drink
ablity
and
mouth
feel
were
mostly
a
continuation
of
how
much
you
enjoy
the
taste
but
in
this
case
i
like
the
taste
more
than
the
drinking
experience
d
super
light
but
the
body
has
a
reasonable
amount
of
complexity
not
the
best
beer
for
the
season
but
a
tasty
example
the
taste
is
very
light
and
somewhat
disappointing
what
should
be
a
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
is
marred
by
a
smokey
middle
the
finish
is
somewhat
better
but
this
is
anything
but
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
d
appearance
and
smell
kind
of
gets
me
all
pumped
up
and
then
there
was
a
giant
let
down
on
the
taste
and
finish
to
me
overall
this
one
is
just
so
so
for
me
pours
a
hazy
dark
yellow
with
a
big
head
that
both
retains
and
laces
quite
well
smells
of
hops
light
fruits
and
citrus
with
a
slight
metallic
smell
tastes
of
spicy
citrus
and
hops
with
notes
of
wheat
moderately
high
carbonation
and
a
moderately
light
body
with
very
little
bitterness
nothing
too
complex
here
but
a
very
drinkable
wheat
ale
for
a
warm
day
with
an
appropriate
abv
not
bad
not
great
but
good
this
is
my
personal
favorite
from
sam
adams
it
tastes
just
like
the
name
coastal
wheat
it
has
awesome
drinkability
the
added
lemon
gives
balance
and
brightness
the
alcohol
content
is
way
better
than
cherry
wheat
so
that
just
adds
to
the
value
you
get
great
hop
flavor
its
refreshing
the
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
but
on
a
cold
january
night
coastal
wheat
comes
off
as
a
fairly
mediocre
offering
from
sam
adams
overall
a
nice
beer
i
did
find
out
that
my
preference
leans
towards
putting
my
own
lemons
in
american
pale
wheats
the
lemon
is
good
but
tastes
a
tad
fake
overall
too
light
and
too
bland
to
even
think
about
will
have
to
pass
on
this
one
if
it
ever
comes
back
around
poured
from
the
bottle
a
creamy
golden
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
disapated
quickly
and
left
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
was
overly
lemony
almost
like
a
cleaner
or
pinsol
taste
was
terrible
light
malt
flavor
didnt
pick
up
any
wheat
and
then
came
the
lemons
way
too
much
lemon
that
left
u
with
a
horrible
lemon
soap
aftertaste
mouthfeel
for
this
beer
might
have
been
its
best
attribute
creamy
and
soft
with
a
fuller
body
than
expected
drnkability
for
me
was
nill
i
tried
to
drink
it
let
it
warm
up
nothing
drain
pour
and
will
not
be
looking
to
have
another
super
disappointed
with
this
beer
started
off
with
a
nice
head
that
died
in
seconds
after
that
it
was
just
boring
barely
any
wheat
to
speak
of
and
barely
any
citrus
notes
or
anything
along
those
lines
basically
just
a
bad
attempt
at
a
wheat
beer
overall
b
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
stuff
and
maybe
its
because
it
isnt
samuel
adams
best
beer
but
it
shouldnt
be
compared
to
other
beers
score
wise
with
that
beign
said
i
think
this
beer
alone
without
looking
at
the
other
better
ones
is
actually
a
really
drinkable
refreshing
beer
if
you
like
the
flavor
you
can
easily
have
a
whole
6
pack
with
the
summer
like
beer
flavor
and
lower
alcohol
content
i
bet
its
not
high
in
calories
either
it
does
smell
like
subtle
lemons
mixed
with
wheat
its
not
like
disgusting
hit
you
in
the
face
artificial
mikes
hard
lemonade
type
of
a
beer
no
not
at
all
this
is
definitely
a
beer
because
that
lemon
taste
and
smell
mixes
in
with
the
hops
they
use
very
well
it
then
leaves
you
with
a
very
nice
wheat
malt
to
finish
it
off
leaving
citrus
and
some
real
lemon
mixing
with
the
hops
nice
carbonation
as
well
id
pick
this
over
blue
moon
any
day
d
medicinal
aftertaste
makes
this
hard
to
finish
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
coastal
wheat
is
a
slightly
hazy
peachorange
color
with
a
solid
white
head
comprised
of
many
fine
bubbles
i
have
several
chunkies
floating
around
in
my
beer
the
nose
is
rather
unremarkable
other
than
the
lemon
peel
and
malty
backdrop
flavor
is
also
rather
unremarkable
with
an
off
medicinal
taste
that
seems
out
of
place
mouthfeel
is
probably
one
of
the
better
aspects
of
the
beer
medium
to
full
in
body
with
a
viscous
and
creamy
carbonation
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
certainly
not
for
bbc
i
usually
find
myself
liking
most
of
what
they
put
out
but
this
is
not
one
of
those
beers
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
to
anybody
unless
they
are
a
fanatic
of
sucking
lemons
or
eating
34
boxes
of
lemonheads
a
night
luckily
i
bought
a
varietly
6pack
and
only
had
to
suffer
through
two
of
these
bastards
two
thumbs
down
d
very
drinkable
and
very
sam
adams
has
a
nice
subtle
lemon
aroma
has
a
creamy
taste
yet
has
that
lemon
zing
to
round
it
out
very
refreshing
has
soft
milky
amber
color
dry
with
very
little
after
taste
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
best
served
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
d
its
an
ok
beer
but
it
just
comes
out
as
light
a
good
beer
for
some
occasions
the
mouthfeel
is
about
right
just
a
hair
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
its
incredibly
drinakble
though
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
think
id
enjoy
it
more
on
a
hot
day
than
in
the
cold
of
winter
here
worth
trying
for
sure
d
this
has
decent
drinkability
its
an
okay
beer
but
i
think
they
should
tone
down
the
lemon
a
bit
this
would
probably
be
an
alright
beer
for
drinking
out
on
the
beach
on
a
hot
day
smell
is
a
rush
of
lemon
and
citrus
the
appearance
is
a
pale
color
with
vivid
flushes
of
a
light
gold
color
very
smooth
and
a
very
sweet
beer
the
drinkability
is
superior
i
could
only
best
describe
this
beer
as
a
light
form
of
sam
adams
summer
ale
truly
a
great
beer
from
the
sam
adams
line
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
really
my
favorite
style
cutting
the
sweetness
would
make
this
better
in
my
opinion
12
oz
bottle
from
the
samuel
adams
winter
variety
pack
why
have
they
replaced
black
lager
from
the
pack
beats
me
hazy
golden
pour
with
a
foamy
wheat
ale
type
head
aroma
of
citrus
sweet
malt
with
some
yeast
and
hops
medium
crisp
sweet
body
sweet
malt
and
citrus
fruit
fills
the
mouth
finish
becomes
tart
at
the
end
drinkable
but
sam
adams
can
do
better
if
it
were
fresher
it
would
probably
receive
a
higher
grade
from
me
it
was
worth
a
shot
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
sometime
conclusion
i
imagine
that
this
is
tasty
if
it
is
super
fresh
and
served
on
tap
in
the
bottle
and
not
fresh
however
it
doesnt
taste
good
the
first
offering
i
have
tasted
from
sam
adams
that
didnt
impress
me
in
any
way
the
less
than
a
finger
head
from
the
pour
just
didnt
hang
around
long
the
lace
has
an
even
coat
but
not
much
cling
the
brew
is
slightly
cloudy
and
its
color
is
a
5
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
of
citrus
wheat
and
malt
tastes
of
lemon
peel
lime
black
pepper
roasted
wheat
and
sour
malt
quite
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
category
just
not
a
lot
of
body
found
in
moving
it
around
in
my
tasting
orifice
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
another
if
no
better
choice
was
available
at
the
time
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
another
the
appearance
is
nothing
special
but
the
citrus
smell
is
amazing
the
taste
is
as
i
imagined
anything
sam
adams
never
dissapoints
the
lemon
flavor
really
comes
out
in
the
end
it
has
a
very
drinkable
taste
and
went
very
well
with
the
turkey
from
thanksgiving
lighter
body
a
good
refreshing
amount
of
carbonation
not
very
exciting
but
not
bad
better
than
others
in
the
style
d
a
very
simple
beer
but
i
enjoyed
it
enough
to
have
another
overall
the
label
says
it
alllemony
indeed
like
the
cranberry
lambic
the
fruity
aspect
is
fully
front
and
centerthis
could
easily
be
a
sessions
beer
that
rewards
with
flavor
d
the
muted
flavors
dont
leave
much
for
me
to
desire
as
a
session
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
wheat
notes
and
a
small
hint
of
citrus
in
the
taste
wheaty
a
sugary
lemon
citrus
and
hints
of
orange
a
small
bite
and
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
lemon
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
lack
of
nose
and
somewhat
sugar
citrus
a
bit
sweet
for
me
avoid
at
all
costs
coastal
wheat
has
all
the
makings
of
a
solid
beer
except
for
how
it
tastes
an
unfortunate
misstep
poured
a
medium
gold
color
that
fades
to
a
more
yellowstraw
color
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
there
is
some
visible
carbonation
that
forms
a
small
white
colored
head
that
dissolves
away
quickly
a
yeasty
twang
in
the
aromaat
first
scent
that
is
followed
by
a
light
lemony
fragrance
it
finishes
with
a
bread
and
grassy
fragrance
a
strong
bread
and
wheat
flavor
at
the
front
of
each
taste
a
citrus
tang
that
is
not
bitter
or
sour
more
like
a
good
lemonade
the
taste
finishes
with
a
mild
grassy
bitterness
nothing
to
overbearing
the
carbonation
is
strong
at
the
front
along
with
a
thin
but
not
watery
feel
the
carbonation
does
linger
at
the
backend
as
the
beeralso
gains
weight
making
it
quenchable
i
am
not
partial
to
wheat
beers
but
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
bright
color
stands
out
the
aroma
screams
summer
the
taste
of
wheat
is
what
you
want
in
the
summer
then
the
feel
quenches
your
hot
thirsty
palate

color
with
a
slight
white
head
and
plenty
of
visible
carbonation
nose
is
mostly
of

the
taste
is
more
faint
fake
lemon
and
a
bit
of
grain
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
crisp
but
seems
more
like
a
lightlyflavored

drinkability
is
okay
as
the
flavors
arent
so
much
offensive
as
they
are
artificial
another
girlfriend

from

i
could
not
even
finish
one
of
these

just
isnt
there
it
wasnt
the
easiest
to
finish
this
pale

a
light
golden

has
the
delicate
taste
of
wheat
and
lemons
a
great

beer
as
it
drinks
lightly
and
tastes
great
another
great
beer
from
sam
adams
this
beer
is
ok
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
wouldnt
go
out
and
buy
any
though
i
had
very
high
hopes
for
the
beer
as
i
love
sas
summer
ale
and
i
knew
this
was
sort
of
a
precursor
to
that
beer
however
it
pales
in
comparison
the
offputting
citrus
taste
in
the
body
is
just
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
d
the
lemons
have
more
of
a
cleaner
flavor
than
a
lemon
aid
or
fresh
lemon
quality
the
beer
is
very
dry
with
no
fruitiness
or
any
yeast
characteristics
so
the
flavor
is
a
bit
dull
with
not
much
character
this
beer
might
be
thirst
queching
on
a
hot
day
looks
and
tastes
like
a
mix
between
a
wit
and
a
hefe
this
is
a
great
warm
weather
beer
with
a
perfect
little
lemon
twist
boston
beer
co
didnt
have
a
summer
beer
before
this
one
and
this
is
a
great
beer
on
a
warm
summer
on
where
i
live
a
hot
fall
day
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
of

it

ok

yup
lemon
grass
or
lemon
peel
stands
out
in
the
aroma
with
wheat
that
feels
more
like
an
afterthought
the
taste
also
brings
ouit
the
lemon
but
not
in
a
sour
lemony
way
the
wheat
kicks
in
a
little
around
the
edges
and
there
is
also
a
sickly
sweetness
going
on
i
should
have
tried
this
in
july
rather
than
september
it
might
have
been
more
appealing
on
a
hot

i
prefer
the
summer
ale
but
these
two
are
quite
similar
both
having
a

taste
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
didnt
find
it
really
impressive
if
you
like
a
good
wheat
bells
oberon
is
still
tops
in
my
book
d
nothing
offensive

nothing
overly
memorable
a
tasty
drink
but
it
couldve
used
a
bit
more
ummph
as
much
as
it
serves
as
a
tasty
and
refreshing
patio
drink
it
requires
a
bit
more
flavour
to
bump
it
up
a
notch
taste
is
crisp
sharp
an
wheaty
its
light
and
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
overall
decent
the
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
for
a
sam
adams
but
it
does
have
a
slightly
higher
carbonation
than
most
im
a
little
biased
because
i
tend
to
like
the
lemon
flavor
but
i
do
recommend
that
you
give
it
a
try
you
probably
wont
be
disappointed
the
beer
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
as
drinkable
as
it
could
be
sam
adams
coastal
wheatpoured
a
sortta
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
head
that
stuck
around
it
smelt
like
dish
soap
and
skunk
however
it
taste
like
a
decent
wheat
beer
with
a
strong
lemon
flavor
favor
the
flavor
was
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
the
overpowering
lemon
flavo
might
be
too
much
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
get
again
i
just
wasnt
impressed
with
this
it
struck
me
as
a
bit
flat
in
flavor
not
carbonation
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
crispness
especially
since
its
supposed
to
have
a
citruslemon
profile
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
overall
and
is
actually
one
of
my
least
favorite
wheats
which
is
a
pity
because
sam
adams
makes
some
exceptional
beers
especially
wheats
mouth
feel
wise
its
got
plenty
of
carbonation
to
keep
this
beer
refreshing
and
has
a
kind
of
powdery
finish
from
the
yeasties
d
that
hint
of
soapiness
really
impacts
drinkability
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
session
and
im
glad
there
are
only
two
of
this
in
the
sampler
sixer
i
picked
up
had
this
on
tap
at
taco
mac
perimeter
the
beer
was
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
bit
of
head
the
smell
reminds
me
of
lemon
scented
dawn
dishsoap
way
to
overpowering
of
lemons
the
taste
is
over
whelming
of
lemons
and
i
found
it
to
be
way
too
much
i
couldnt
really
taste
any
of
the
flavors
from
the
beer
it
felt
almost
if
the
lemon
taste
was
competing
with
the
other
flavors
of
the
beer
very
disappointing
i
purchased
this
in
a
variety
pack
that
had
the
black
lager
and
irish
red
out
of
the
three
this
one
was
the
most
peculiar
it
was
okay
but
no
need
for
me
to
have
this
one
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
it
is
perfect
for
summer
pours
a
cloudy

with
thick

fading

bubbles
steadily
rising
lemony

reminiscent
of

of
all
things
lemon

overpowers
both
the
wheat
malt
scent
and
flavor
medium
on
the
mouthfeel
heavy
lemon
aftertaste
not
the
best
of
wheat
beers
other
sam
adams
has
really
been
fantastic
this
one
is
decent
but
not
amazing
one
more
in
the
fridge
not
bringing
this
home
again
tastes
average
as
though
they
tried
to
make
a
combination
summer
alewheat
beer
but
instead
of
trying
traditional
summer
techniques
they
just
added
some
kind
of
lemon
flavoring
which
overpowers
the
natural
wheat
flavor
i
dont
really
care
for
it
there
is
also
a
heaviness
to
the
flavor
that
would
make
it
difficult
to
drink
more
wont
get
again
d
the
sourness
of
the
lemon
slightly
cuts
down
on
the
drinkability

but
really
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
is
a
good
but
not
great
beer
this
is
a
good
choice
when
all
you
have
to
choose
from
are
bmc
boston
lager
and
a
sam
adams
seasonal
although
i
prefer
the
boston
lager
unique
brew
stands
out
from
the
crowd
but
not
necessarily
for
quality
d
light
crisp
and
refreshing
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
good
summer
beer
its
not
really
my
thing
though
i
another
triumph
for
the
boston
beer
company
cheers
d
very
very
drinkable
i
could
down
a
sixer
in
a
snap
on
a
hot
day
i
heard
this
wasnt
good
but
i
disagree
its
pretty
similar
to
there
summer
ale
offering
but
with
a
bright
lemon
citrus
on
the
finish
that
i
really
liked
i
think
id
buy
this
one
again
sometime
and
you
cant
beat
the
price
for
what
you
get
thats
for
sure
cheers
overall
there
wasnt
much
to
pick
from
at
the
restaurant
in
which
i
had
this
beer
so
i
decided
to
try
it
i
expected
to
be
disappointed
because
i
dont
really
like
this
style
of
beers
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
actually
ordered
another
one
and
i
rarely
order
the
same
beer
twice
in
a
row
while
there
isnt
much
complexity
or
even
flavor
to
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
and
was
surprised
to
see
it
get
such
bad
reviews
poured
into
a
sa
glass
a
nice
cloudy
pale

meh
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
if
some
of
my
favorites
werent
available
i
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
it
didnt
have
much
head
that
disappread
quickly
to
lace
it
has
a
hazy
golden
color
to
it
a
nice
smell
of
lemon
have
a
great
citruslemon
wheat
taste
which
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
just
nice
and
easy
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
sam
adam
coastal
wheat
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
thin
head
that
fades
like
soda
the
aroma
is
lemon
and
wheat
with
hints
of
spice
maybe
from
the
yeast
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
nice
wheat
character
that
leads
to
a
artificial
lemon
flavor
according
to
the
label
they
use
real
lemons
it
just
comes
across
as
artificial
there
is
some
nice
flavor
going
on
with
the
yeast
and
maybe
some
corriander
but
overall
the
beer
reminds
me
of
a
soda
certainly
easy
drinking
i
like
it
a
little
more
than
the
summer
but
it
is
too
similar
i
think
poured
into
my
sam
adams
pint
glass
and
was
presented
with
a
2
finger
head
that
disappeared
pretty
quickly
pretty
hazy
looking
with
a
nice
golden
color
smells
pretty
lagerish
pretty
citrusy
smelling
as
well
tastes
just
like
an
extra
lemony
hefe
the
tastes
go
well
together
not
to
overpowering
in
any
1
area
flavors
are
also
very
crisp
and
refreshing
wheat
and
malt
upfront
with
a
refreshing
lemon
and
hop
aftertaste
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
medium
carbonation
light
to
medium
bodied
a
nice
beer
candidate
to
turn
people
onto
crafts
beers
as
it
is
not
to
extreme
d
im
not
sure
why
sam
adams
has
this
and
their
summer
ale
out
at
the
same
time
since
theyre
the
exact
same
style
but
i
ended
up
enjoying
this
one
more
its
a
little
more
simplistic
but
its
essentially
what
a
summer
wheat
ale
should
be
clean
and
crisp
taste
with
good
body
still
nothing
special
but
its
enjoyable
d
pretty
solid
drinkability
easy
to
down
lowish
abv
another
gift
from
my
wifes
friend
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
straw
golden
color
with
just
a
little
cloudy
white
head
huge
lemony
aromas
along
with
wheat
and
just
a
bit
of
funkiness
similar
on
the
palate
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
on
a
summer
day
d
this
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
goes
nicely
on
a
pleasant
summer
evening
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
but
doesnt
have
the
best
after
taste
drinkability
its
a
summer
brew
i
dont
think
i
will
buy
again
but
it
is
better
then
most
i
have
had
of
this
style
d
this
strikes
me
as
a
run
of
the
mill
wheat
beer
just
simple
tasting
with
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
yet
nothing
thats
offensive
either
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
couple
more
of
these
on
another
hot
day
drinkability
im
truthfully
not
digging
the
flavours
all
that
much
and
the
mouthfeel
is
too
substantial
for
me
occasional
use
only
the
other
2
bottlesbeers
in
the
6
pack
i
like
more
d
pretty
good
beer
that
would
be
good
for
putting
back
in
the
summer
months
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
though
d
it
goes
without
saying
that
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
porch
sittin
in
the
summer
d
average
drinkability
could
use
more
citrus
in
it
drink
it
with
a
real
leomn
slice
lemons
and
malt
up
front
moderate
wheat
presence
as
expected
thin
watery
mouthfeel
light
body
with
a
smooth
finish
similar
to
maybe
slightly
superior
to
blue
moon
i
was
geared
up
to
really
not
like
this
beer
but
bought
it
because
my
wife
loves
wheat
beers
and
thought
she
might
enjoy
something
other
than
blue
moon
the
pour
was
nice
with
a
great
burnt
goldish
color
and
a
nice
frothy
head
lemon
zest
and
bready
malts
jumped
out
and
created
an
inviting
scent
flavor
was
perfect
for
a
hot
san
diego
day
with
a
crisp
citrus
bite
slight
honey
like
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
in
the
background
all
in
all
a
very
enjoyable
warm
weather

samuel

coastal
wheat
pours
yellow
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
lot
of
lemon
in
the
nose
the
flavor
also
has
quite
the
dominant
lemon
flavor
there
is
a
bit
of
a
wheat
aftertaste
decent
but
doesnt
stand
out
single
from
an
slc
liquor
store
yeah
its
come
to
this
the
body
is
crisp
and
bordering
on
harsh
carbonation
level
is
higher
than
id
like
flavors
of
mild
grains
some
citrus
punch
and
the
finish
is
very
buttery
and
smooth
this
is
a
runofthemill
pale
wheat
nothing
spectacular
but
it
would
do
at
a
cookout
for
sure
i
am
normally
a
fan
of
sam
adams
beersthey
do
a
very
nice
job
on
a
wide
variety
of
brews
this
one
was
simply
yucky
however
in
the
previous
ba
reviews
of
this
beer
i
dont
see
others
who
encountered
the
diacetyl
bomb
so
ill
give
sam
a
fair
second
chance
d
easy
drinking
could
definitely
put
back
a
few
of
these
due
to
mild
flavor
and
thinness
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
the
brew
smells
like
wheat
and
some
weird
lemon
citrusy
aroma
thats
hard
to
describe
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
some
spicy
hops
noticable
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
ok
once
i
get
used
to
the
weird
lemon
taste
its
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
not
one
of
the
better
sam
adams
brews
ive
had
luckily
i
just
bought
a
single
of
this
and
not
a
6
pack
overall
cant
say
im
too
impressed
and
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
its
refreshing
but
its
not
as
clean
as
a
pilsner
and
not
as
interesting
as
a
wheat
beer
i
would
go
one
way
or
the
other
happily
but
wont
be
going
back
to
this
found
at
the
sam
adams
bar
at
myrtle
beach
airport
in
south
carolina
this
has
a
light
but
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
decent
white
froth
on
top
and
pretty
good
lacing
to
boot
the
aroma
brings
light
lemon
fruit
nougat
sponge
cake
the
flavor
has
some
citrus
hop
lemon
brightness
and
crisp
grassy
biscuit
i
get
some
dishater
soapiness
here
that
makes
this
a
bit
less
than
a
simple
sevenup
summer
brew
but
it
is
a
refreshing
option
well
carbonated
and
plenty
drinkable
if
the
dishwater
doesnt
get
to
you
not
something
ill
need
to
revisit
poured
a
clear
gold
with
good
but
quickly
receding
head
an
average
smell
of
sour
lemon
and
faint
spices
along
w
a
touch
of
sweetness
fluffy
wheaty
mouthfeel
but
nothing
really
there
other
than
some
basic
lemony
citric
zip
and
some
sweetness
not
bad
but
nothing
really
to
write
home
about
one
is
fine
as
i
finished
this
alright
but
didnt
desire
another
one
hazed
lemony
copper
with
a
finger
of
soft
white
foam
wheat
malt
and
faint
herbal
hops
in
the
nose
soft
lemon
and
wheat
malt
with
a
dry
spicy
finish
earthy
hops
balance
fairly
well
edium
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
a
touch
too
lemon
zesty
for
my
tastes
an
average
beer
this
fits
the
bill
for
a
session
beer
but
one
of
these
is
going
to
make
you
want
something
to
was
your
mouth
out
with
going
along
the
line
of
more
wheat
or
hops
like
the
southern
tier
hop
sun
could
have
made
this
stand
out
instead
its
a
curiosity
before
sampling
and
an
oddity
afterwards
certainly
unique
but
not
memorable
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
pours
a
bright
somewhat
hazy
straw
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
leave
virtually
no
lacing
smells
lemony
and
this
is
definitely
indicative
of
things
to
come
lemon
flavors
are
overpowering
the
wheat
malt
is
too
subtle
which
sounds
weird
coming
out
of
my
mouth
since
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
something
of
a
sub
par
offering
in
my
opinion
could
definitely
knock
back
several
of
these
if
one
were
so
inclined
though
updatetried
the
other
bottle
came
in
with
a
head
full
of
steam
psyching
myself
up
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
just
as
awful
as
the
last
one
another
for
the
sink
tastes
and
smells
like
hand
soap
very
quickly
losing
the
desire
to
buy
anything
sa
as
13
of
the
nine
dollar
six
pack
got
poured
d
for
my
taste
average
drinkability
perhaps
more
citrusy
hops
or
a
little
more
lemon
a
light
body
but
intensely
crisp
and
fizzy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
and
pleasant
but
decidedly
mediocre
across
the
board
d
refreshing
but
not
as
strong
offering
as
their
summer
ale
d
as
with
most
of
their
beers
drinkability
seems
to
be
the
main
focus
and
things
are
no
different
here
a
citrusylemon
wheat
beer
that
was
wet
and
juicy
with
a
clean
sense
will
no
doubt
quench
the
thirst
on
a
hot
summer
day
good
to
throw
back
with
casual
conversation
while
a
six
pack
purchase
will
certainly
not
go
to
waste
d
a
very
refreshing
summertime
beer
but
not
something
that
stands
out
from
a
crowd
have
a
quick
one
of
these
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
dont
plan
on
kicking
back
d
pretty
drinkable
overall
but
unfortunately
just
an
average
wheat
ale
but
i
guess
sam
adams
isnt
really
known
for
wheat
beers
i
wouldnt
avoid
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
fuzzy
pale
yellow
in
color
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
going
on
somewhat
metallic
sharp
aroma
citrusy
flavors
upfrontnot
quite
a
lemon
lime
flavor
balances
ok
enough
against
the
crisp
wheat
flavor
maybe
a
tad
overdone
in
the
lemony
department
ok
body
for
the
light
flavor
overall
an
ok
beer
maybe
more
popular
with
the
non
craft
crowd
in
general
overall
while
not
the
first
disappointing
beer
that
ive
had
from
sam
adams
its
certainly
the
only
one
i
can
say
that
i
didnt
like
it
just
comes
across
as
a
weak
attempt
but
who
knows
they
could
still
fix
this
by
concentrating
on
the
redeeming
qualities
after
all
the
lemon
isnt
bad
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
and
not
much
for
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
a
liitle
bit
citrus
like
but
very
vague
nothing
else
really
stood
out
the
beer
was
very
light
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
much
to
it
i
prefer
beers
that
have
a
lot
more
going
on
the
beer
wasnt
great
but
also
wasnt
that
bad
probably
would
work
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
bbq
or
something
of
that
nature
taste
was
thin
nothing
about
this
beer
turned
me
off
no
bad
tastes
initially
it
had
a
nice
taste
but
disappeared
quickly
and
left
with
aftertaste
of
old
flat
beer
good
lawnmower
beer
good
very
cold
that
being
said
if
you
havent
picked
up
already
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
light
wheat
beer
i
thought
this
was
an
average
brew
not
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
maybe
its
just
because
ive
been
working
outside
all
day
on
this
abnormally
warm
april
day
in
georgia
90s
but
this
beer
is
definitely
hitting
the
spot
light
and
flavorful
but
not
overdone
a
superrefreshing
beer
d
its
light
and
easy
to
down
one
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
make
this
a
session
beer
its
got
a
very
interesting
tart
tingly
taste
to
it
very
dry
aftertaste
its
sweet
and
lemony
but
im
not
loving
this
might
be
great
on
a
very
hot
day
but
quite
average
beer
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
light
head
the
smell
is
that
of
grain
mixed
with
lemoncitrus
the
taste
is
fairly
light
with
decent
flavor
the
finish
is
fairly
smooth
crisp
but
with
a
lemony
finish
that
just
seems
to
linger
indefinitely
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
the
lemon
after
taste
reminded
me
of
macro
beers
trying
to
cash
in
on
the
lemon
beer
craze
this
is
the
first
sam
adams
beer
that
did
not
quite
meet
the
standard
i
expected
this
brew
is
refreshing
would
be
a
decent
brew
to
have
on
a
hot
day
the
problem
here
is
there
are
many
many
brews
that
satisfy
this
need
very
hohum
drinkability
crisp
refreshing
solid
wheat
beer
though
it
can
be
improved
it
does
nothing
wrong
it
is
really
drinkable
especially
if
you
like
wheat
you
will
have
no
problem
having
these
non
stop
if
you
dont
especially
care
for
this
kind
of
beer
you
may
find
this
slightly
boring
but
i
dont
think
anyone
would
find
this
offensive
samuel
adams
coastal
wheat
is
a
hazy
light
golden
ale
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
film
that
leaves
nice
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
faint
aroma
of
light
fresh
grain
and
a
slight
hint
of
funk
and
fruitiness
its
light
bodied
and
quite
smooth
the
finish
is
clean
its
very
lightly
flavored
with
wheat
and
a
hint
of
lemon
i
dont
think
i
would
have
detected
the
actual
lemon
if
i
wouldntve
read
it
on
the
bottle
theres
a
slight
sweaty
funkiness
to
it
thats
a
little
distracting
its
not
bad
but
its
not
really
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
on
purpose
unless
i
was
really
thirsty
i
was
expecting
more
lemons
from
the
description
on
the
bottle
but
just
a
hint
more
like
a
refreshing
summer
beer
kinda
odd
it
came
out
this
time
of
year
instead
of
spring
time
nice
wheat
character
amber
orange
hue
head
didnt
last
long
but
neither
did
the
beer
another
fine
beer
from
a
fine
brewery
d
its
pretty
unoffensive
but
just
dont
like
it
enough
to
down
a
lot
off
d
fairly
clean
easy
drinking
brew
not
terribly
exciting
though
d
good
bbq
beer
with
its
inoffensive
flavor
and
light
subdued
profile
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
sam
adams
rarely
dissapoints
drinkability
so
they
decided
to
ditch
the
spring
ale
for
noble
pils
and
then
they
repackaged
the
spring
ale
and
doctored
it
up
a
bit
for
coastal
wheat
not
a
huge
fan
they
need
to
do
something
else
with
this
and
make
a
new
beer
in
my
opinion
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
but
exceedingly
light
and
easy
going
down
light
citrus
particularly
lemon
and
pretty
basic
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
thin
with
slight
carbonation
not
a
real
positive
for
this
style
overall
this
is
a
good
one
for
a
summer
day
but
just
not
great
poured
the
coastal
wheat
from
a
bottle
to
a
glass
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
fades
very
fast
to
a
white
ring
there
is
not
much
of
a
nose
a
little
wheat
and
kind
of
grainy
a
citrusy
taste
at
first
and
a
pretty
watery
finish
this
beer
has
a
pretty
light
body
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
and
lightly
carbonated
pretty
crisp
okay
summer
beer
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
creamy
and
crisp
the
body
of
the
beer
is
very
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
light
this
is
a
descent
lawnmower
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
better
then
average
wheat
beer
that
said
i
dont
really
like
most
wheat
beers
it
is
golden
in
color
with
a
typical
cloudy
appearance
but
is
able
to
maintain
a
good
head
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
typical
citrus
the
carbonation
starts
slightly
harsh
but
sweet
taste
quickly
takes
over
and
finishes
dry
with
no
bitterness
d
if
i
was
drunk
this
would
be
easy
to
session
for
all
the
touting
of
the
lemon
peel
used
in
this
beer
i
found
very
little
of
it
shining
through
there
was
a
vague
lemony
note
but
it
actually
reminded
me
more
of
the
grains
of
paradise
spice
used
in
one
of
bbcs
earlier
offerings
otherwise
a
rather
bland
american
wheat
im
not
sure
why
american
brewers
seem
to
make
such
flavorless
nonhefe
beers
drinkability
is
quite
high
and
these
coiuld
be
downed
quickly
and
in
high
numbers
without
a
problem
a
hazy
golden
color
pour
with
a
medium
sized
short
lasting
soapy
white
head
lively
carbonation
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
with
wheat
as
promised
bread
dough
and
a
hint
of
lemon
grass
flavor
is
quite
yeasty
bread
wheat
lemons
and
some
fait
spice
notes
short
spent
grain
finish
medium
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
quite
drinkable
and
would
deem
sessionable
would
have
liked
this
better
on
a
hot
day
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
but
not
really
something
im
in
the
market
for
just
ok
not
remarkable
good
enough
d
overall
coastal
wheat
would
be
a
pretty
good
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
it
is
light
bodied
and
refreshing
perfect
for
those
warm
summer
days
in
florida
lightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
smallish
but
persevering
dense
white
head
looks
pretty
tasty
the
aroma
is
a
lemony
spicy
aroma
with
no
noticeable
wheat
to
it
that
comes
across
as
almost
solventlike
in
that
respect
the
nose
is
kind
of
harsh
and
unappealing
for
a
beer
of
this
style
the
flavor
is
tart
and
citric
but
it
doesnt
come
across
as
a
very
natural
flavor
somewhat
spicy
and
almost
medicinal
with
no
actual
wheat
noticeable
eh
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
excessly
fizzy
while
it
should
be
well
carbonated
it
feels
artificial
and
seltzery
instead
of
natural
a
drinkable
beer
but
no
aspects
i
find
too
appealing
i
dont
see
much
reason
to
drink
this
one
im
not
entirely
sure
what
to
think
of
this
one
the
bottle
says
its
a
twist
on
a
hefeweizen
but
this
site
classifies
it
as
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
if
im
to
compare
this
beer
to
what
the
bottle
says
then
i
enjoy
it
because
of
the
quality
of
the
lemon
notes
and
the
lack
of
what
i
can
only
describe
as
the
pungent
sensation
which
i
find
in
many
hefes
and
dislike
regardless
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
d
not
sure
why
this
is
the
new
spring
beer
to
me
its
more
of
a
summer
beer
its
very
similar
to
summer
ale
i
think
it
may
be
better
but
its
been
9
months
since
ive
had
summer
ale
ill
have
to
try
a
side
by
side
in
my
mind
though
sam
adams
needs
a
bock
not
another
beer
similar
to
two
they
already
have
that
said
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
like
it
i
just
dont
quite
understand
it
wheat
beers
are
not
my
favorite
style
i
rarely
drink
them
so
my
frame
of
reference
is
limited
the
only
thing
similar
ive
had
recently
was
shock
top
and
this
is
far
superior
although
a
different
style
light
golden
color
lemon
hints
nice
pour
sweet
lemon
scent
typically
average
definitely
drinkable
but
id
probably
buy
something
else
as
opposed
to
a
six
or
12
pack
of
this
if
i
was
being
served
this
at
a
party
or
wherever
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
but
id
probably
choose
something
else
d
yuck
not
a
pleasant
wheat
beer
at
all
in
fact
i
think
that
is
a
nice
way
of
stating
it
in
summation
i
cant
be
all
too
critical
of
this
beer
yes
i
do
know
that
it
doesnt
fit
all
too
well
with
what
a
typical
wheat
beer
would
taste
like
yes
i
do
understand
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
it
is
a
macro
brew
yes
i
do
realize
that
this
is
not
the
end
all
be
all
definitive
wheat
brew
however
for
what
it
is
it
is
really
good
just
when
i
think
sam
adams
is
doing
it
right
i
get
another
bad
wheat
rendition
perhaps
upping
the
wheat
beers
in
response
to
golden
wheatblue
moon
competition
d
there
isnt
too
much
to
write
home
on
this
one
the
flavors
are
not
very
big
but
that
could
lead
to
have
a
few
extra
because
it
goes
down
like
a
macro
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
the
drinkability
is
good
this
wheat
ale
is
meant
to
be
drunk
in
the
summer
so
why
did
sam
adams
offer
this
in
their
winter
sampler
nice
flavor
but
i
agree
that
this
should
be
a
summer
beer
instead
of
featured
in
the
winter
sampler
decent
easy
drinking
wheat
by
sam
adams
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
hard
to
drink
this
one
and
not
compare
it
to
other
sam
adams
wheat
beers
and
although
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
dont
think
its
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
similar
products
poured
from
the
bottle
this
had
a
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacings
the
smell
and
taste
were
both
pretty
boring
and
worse
than
i
expected
the
beer
had
a
nice
dry
feel
to
it
but
was
overall
lacking
in
taste
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
but
getting
it
from
the
brewmasters
collection
i
certainly
wouldnt
let
it
go
to
waste
score
3
78
this
beer
is
medium
in
feel
and
is
really
wet
it
can
hit
the
spot
though
if
your
craving
a
wheat
so
dont
count
it
out
completely
it
does
the
job
for
me
but
its
not
amazing
value
i
wouldnt
pay
more
than
6
bucks
for
a
sixer
of
this
pale
gold
straw
color
frothy
white
head
quickly
gone
smell
of
lemon
zest
and
a
decent
fresh
cracked
wheat
smell
taste
is
wow
sugary
sweet
articial
flavored
candy
lemon
drops
decent
pale
wheat
background
but
the
lemon
is
too
much
light
bodied
slightly
overly
carbonated
i
dont
understand
the
boston
beer
comapny
at
times
so
many
of
their
non
traditional
beer
ingredients
come
across
as
sweet
and
artifical
and
this
is
perhaps
the
worst
of
the
bunch
the
grains
and
hops
can
be
very
good
but
the
attempt
at
flavoring
is
just
wrong
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
which
is
very
disappointing
for
a
wheat
beer
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
and
crispy
wheat
it
is
a
pleasant
aroma
but
rather
weak
even
for
a
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
a
little
more
pronounced
there
is
a
lot
of
lemon
almost
dominant
lemon
and
im
really
not
liking
it
it
gets
really
old
really
fast
the
mouthfeel
is
annoyingly
high
carbonated
and
lighter
bodied
overall
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
and
would
recommend
that
others
safe
their
time
and
money
on
other
beers
too
bought
a
sample
pack
with
the
coastal
wheat
somewhat
dull
and
murky
strawyellow
appearance
with
thin
lacing
lemoncitrus
mixed
with
a
wheat
scent
taste
is
a
little
bland
a
bittersweet
mix
of
sour
lemon
flavor
was
apparent
however
it
tasted
a
little
watered
down
the
body
was
a
little
light
and
watery
overall
it
was
ok
pours
a
golden
pale
straw
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
smells
like
wheat
and
leather
taste
is
a
bit
watery
with
some
wheat
and
hints
of
yeast
and
a
little
bit
of
mustiness
and
leather
in
the
finish
the
biggest
detractor
for
me
in
this
brew
was
the
overcarbonation
theres
just
not
too
much
to
rave
about
here
its
decent
but
nothing
more
d
not
much
complexity
with
this
brew
not
a
wheat
beer
i
would
reach
for
on
a
consistent
basis
in
the
summer
unlike
other
beers
ive
rated
a
c
which
i

came
in
the

pack
this
year
i
am
not
sure
why
they
added
this
beer
to
the
mix
i
would
have
rather
had
the
black
lager
they
had
last
season
to
be
truthful
imo
this
would
have
been
a
fair
brew
to
add
in
the
summer
pack
as
i
think
it
would
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
with
this
being
said
i
thought
the
beer
was
pretty
good
poured
to
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
cloudiness
and
a
good
sized
white
head
that
had
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
was
pale
and
wheat
malts
with
a
mellow
but
pronounced
lemon
scent
plain
and
simple
the

works
fine

with

the
lemon
taste
gains
some
ground
towards
the
end
would
make
a
good
session
beer
with
food
but
not
so
exciting
on
its
own
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
beer
isnt
quite
sure
if
it
is
an
american
wheat
or
a
wit
nice
enough
but
probably
wont
grab
a
6pack
drinkability
is
decent
nothing
here
makes
this
worth
another
round
but
for
the
style
it
gets
the
job
done
a
worthy
example
in
fairness
it
starts
off
well
with
a
foamy
white
head
and
crisp
lemon
zest
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
broad
and
flavorful
but
flat
and
somewhat
one
dimensional
in
texture
its
not
bad
for
the
style
and
would
probably
taste
really
good
in
june
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
seems
ridculously
out
of
place
after
all
that
smow
last
week
d
easy
the
lemon
would
make
this
a
good
starter
brew
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
ok
overall
thats
2
out
of
the
pack
that
threw
me

lambic
also
that
i
would
have
expected
more
from

inexplicable
came
in

be
pointless

that
eventually

into
a
quarter
inch
cap
some
spots
and
strands
of
lacing
but
somewhat
weak
retention
not
much
happening
in
the
nose
a
hint
of

lemonzest
and
a
grainy
quality

consistent
with
nose
however
a
bit
more
citrus
comes
out
and
a
subtle
wheat
character
reveals
itself
finish
is
fairly
clean
with
perhaps
some
residual
lemony
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
a
la
artificial

is
fairly
light
with
a
very
mild
carbonation
not
a
terrible
beer
taste
is
light
and
goes
down
easy
but
not
terribly
flavorful
and
missing
some
of
the
character
of
the
style
wasnt
very
good
to
me
but
to
be
objective
pours
to
a
yellow
color
with
a
decent
but
quickly
disappearing
head
rather
hoppy
with
a
slight
citrus
flavor

not
overpowering
hoppy
but
enough
to
hit
the
sinuses
american
wheat
style
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
12oz
bottle
from
the
holiday
pack
served
in
a
shaker
pint
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
finger
of
fine
bubbled
white
head
wheaty
aroma
but
aroma
was
fairly
faint
light
bodied
decent
malt
base
the
label
touts
lemon
but
the
citrus
was
slight
to
non
existent
a
decent
version
of
an
american
wheat
not
what
you
would
expect
in
a
pack
of
winter
brews
would
be
pretty
drinkable
in
the
summer
i
found
this
a
strange
addition
to
the
holiday
pack
lets
hope
they
correct
this
grave
error
next
year
put
in
the
black
lager
instead
coastal
wheat
is
a
masterfully
crafted
and
well
designed
beer
a
stellar
representation
of
what
i
think
of
as
a
beer
tight
balance
full
flavored
and
highly
quaffable
and
bottle
conditioned
a
plus
d
good
on
a
summer
day
if
you
like

really
impressed
with
another

bravo
value
b
this
might
be
one
of
the
worst
reviews
ive
given
to
a
sa
product
glad
this
only
was
part
of
the
seasonal
mixed
12
pack
and
that
i
didnt
jump
for
a
6
why
make
this
youve
got
the
summer
ale
and
retired
a
perfectly
good
wheat
beer
a
funky
very
different
beer
that
i
have
trouble
finishing
gonna
drink
the
rest
of
the
pint
with
a
bowl
of
popcorn
would
not
be
surprised
if
this
brew
disappeared
from
the

stable
of
beers
jim

if
you
read

do
us
all
a

and
dump
this
turkey
pours
a
hazy
pale
honey
color
with
a
small
tight
white
head
that
settled
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
the
wheat
malt
with
lemon
zest
typical
summer
seasonal
aroma
that
most
breweries
put
out
the
taste
hits
of
lemons
followed
up
by
some
grassy
hops
and
a
very
grainy
malt
flavor
the
flavors
seems
to
clash
and
the
lemon
was
added
to
cover
up
some
of
the
odd
flavors
leaves
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
the
lemon
flavor
is
actually
nice
but
the
rest
doesnt
do
it
for
me
the
feel
is
light
to
moderate
with
spritzy
carbonation
finishes
with
an
odd
bitter
twang
this
beer
is
ok
not
sure
why
they
made
it
though
it
seems
as
if
they
wanted
to
showcase
the
different
lemons
if
that
was
the
case
they
should
have
used
these
lemons
in
their
summer
ale

throws
me
off
halfway

beer

i
am
not

why
it

this
was
not
a
bad
brew
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
im
wont
be
searching
the
stores
for
it
either
d
i
like
the
grainy
beginning
but
im
not
much
on
the
chemical
feel
not
a
bad
light
beer
i
think
it
would
do
on
a
warm
day
kind
of
strange
that
this
was
in

not
sams
greatest
effort

i
certainly
didnt

quality
mouthfeel
is
thin
withy
nothing
special
standing
out
this
beer
is
close
to
being
undrinkable
to
me
and
by
far
my
biggest
disappointment
from
sam
adams
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
a
thick
creamy
head
the
head
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
not
much
else
maybe
some
wheat
the
taste
is
of
wheat
up
front
and
then
a
lemon
taste
the
taste
is
a
little
stingy
mouthfeel
is
good
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
okay
you
could
have
two
or
three
but
not
many
more
the
lemon
flavor
was
a
little
stingy
and
as
you
go
the
smell
becomes
a
little
like
lemon
pledge
this
is
a
beer
that
completely
under
whelmed
me
sweetish
wheat
beer
with
a
little
lemon
a
lot
like
their
summer
ale
and
i
dont
much
care
for
that
one
either
very
ordinary
i
had
this
as
a
sample
at
the
local
liquor
store
interesting
that
theyre
putting
out
what
i
would
consider
a
summer
beer
in
the
winter
the
rep
said
it
is
flavored
with
the
zest
from
three
different
lemons
and
you
can
definitely
tell
this
it
has
a
huge
lemoncitrus
nose
that
follows
into
the
flavor
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
faintly
lemon
taste
is
zesty
lemon
with
a
wheat
backing
good
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
like
water
i
dont
beleive
ive
ever
had
a
bad
samuel
adams
beer
yet
i
recommend
and
would
purchase
any
of
their
beers
d
i
like
most
of
sam
adams
lineup
but
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
probably
wont
buy
again
i
have
never
seen
this
beer
until
recently
and
it
makes
me
wonder
why
sam
adams
would
release
a
citrus
wheat
ale
with
their
winter
lineup
definatley
suited
more
for
the
spring
and
summer
variety
packs
i
got
this
beer
from
the
winter
brew
12pack
this
beer
has
a
cloudy
gold
color
to
it
it
pours
with
a
large
head
the
smell
has
a
slight
scent
of
lemons
but
not
much
else
the
initial
taste
is
sorta
tangy
the
beer
seems
a
little
rough
when
drinking
my
overall
experience
of
this
beer
does
not
leave
me
with
the
urge
to
try
another
did
say
given
the
abv
and
style
its
a
very
sessionable
beer
indeed
overall
i
have
to
say
im
happy
this
is
included
in
the
winter
pack
a
lot
of
people
seem
opposed
to
lighter
beers
in
the
winter
but
i
actually
like
lighter
beers
occasionally
in
the
winter
just
like
i
like
heavy
beers
in
the
summer
it
might
be
worth
a
try
if
youre
not
really
into
wheat
beers
i
personally
am
not
but
probably
not
that
great
if
youre
really
into
them
wow
i
have
been
very
impressed
with
bbc
in
the
past
this
is
a
big
disappointment
weak
aroma
weak
flavor
and
weak
body
even
for
an
apwa
this
is
weak
interesting
and
unexpected
inclusion
in
the
winter
classics
mixed
pack
its
refreshing
to
have
a
summerstyle
beer
in
with
the
heartier
offerings
but
it
still
seems
out
of
place
id
much
prefer
to
see
costal
wheat
in
the
summer
mixed
12
pack
where
its
nuances
would
be
much
more
appreciated
during
that
time
of
the
year
it
would
make
more
sense
for
the
boston
brewing
company
to
include
something
along
the
lines
of
their
cream
stout
or
scotch
ale
or
create
something
new
instead
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
for
winter
this
beer
is
kind
of
like
sa
summer
ale
light
you
really
taste
the
lemon
and
it
has
a
very
light
body
with
a
bit
more
of
a
waterywheaty
finish
than
the
summer
ale
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
stunning
in
its
flavor
or
complexity
the
watery
finish
really
takes
away
from
the
beers
enjoyability
im
really
only
getting
the
lemon
flavor
and
a
little
malt
from
this
d
the
taste
is
holding
me
back
from
having
more
than
2
too
tart
to
really
enjoy
much
of
poured
a
very
small
head
that
left
very
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
its
a
very
hazy
pale
color
all
i
really
get
in
the
smell
is
tangy
lemon
zest
hops
and
possibly
some
caramel
malt
but
maybe
thats
just
me
the
taste
is
mostly
lemon
not
tangy
though
and
a
very
small
amount
of
hops
it
leaves
a
less
than
decent
after
taste
i
cant
really
describe
it
though
not
bad
at
all
this
would
be
a
good
summer
session
there
is
a
little
more
flavor
here
than
in
some
other
pale
wheat
ales
worth
a
try
i
just
dont
know
why
it
is
in
the
winter
mixed
pack
overall
a
very
bland
overly
sweet
wheat
ale
massive
lemon
wheaty
grainy
quality
is
missing
a
decent
wheat
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
cloudy
and
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
sediment
floating
around
looks
very
wheat
beerish
some
lemon
is
detectable
in
the
sent
otherwise
nothing
to
get
excited
about
i
liked
the
summer
ale
and
this
reminds
me
alot
of
that
clean
tangy
sour
not
much
bitterness
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sas
heffeweizen
i
dont
like
the
bland
sour
aftertaste
this
is
better
i
think
the
lemon
helps
this
is
pretty
good
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
it
would
be
better
in
june
than
december
by
that
time
the
summer
ale
will
be
out
it
doesnt
make
much
sense
to
me
to
sell
something
very
close
to
your
summer
seasonal
in
the
dead
of
winter
but
what
do
i
know
d
i
could
see
some
people
enjoying
this
and
having
several
but
im
not
a
fan
its
not
so
bad
that
id
pour
it
but
its
definitely
not
winning
me
over
a
good
beer
especially
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
litebeer
looking
cloudy
and
golden
yellow
nice
white
head
smell
is
of
fresh
lemon
and
sweet
grasses
first
taste
hits
the
back
of
the
gullet
like
a
shot
of
lemon
juice
dropped
into
a
hefeweizen
left
to
linger
in
the
mouth
yet
totally
smooth
no
bite
to
speak
of
not
sure
how
this
beer
fits
with
winter
weather
at
northern
latitudes
but
it
would
serve
well
on
a
hot
summers
day
d
pretty
drinkable
this
one
is
easy
going
down
if
you
like
lemon
flavored
beers
i
could
see
this
one
being
good
in
the
summer
time
d
not
bad
above
average
beer
a
good
break
from
the
traditional
hefeweizen
sans
the
yeast
flavors
the
strength
of
the
flavors
do
limit
the
drinkability
however
overall
this
is
the
most
disappointing
beer
of
the
winter
sampler
i
was
definitely
disappointing
as
i
had
enjoyed
the
summer
ale
very
much
di
cant
imagine
getting
through
a
sixpack
of
this
beer
ill
stick
with
my
german
wheat
beers
i
wish
sa
had
the
cream
stout
or
something
instead
of
this
beer
in
the
winter
sampler
d
extremely
drinkable
i
really
like
it
and
so
do
my
nonbeer
drinking
friends
d
nicely
refreshing
easily
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summers
day
my
only
gripe
is
why
was
this
released
as
a
winter
beer
when
people
think
winter
beers
they
think
dark
and
heavy
not
light
and
fruity
good
beer
but
no
suited
for
winter
more
of
a
summer
beer
in
their
holiday
pack
d
not
bad
im
not
normally
a
big
fan
of
wheat
brews
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
imo
would
be
better
on
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
a
decent
quaff
sorry
sa
guys
i
love
most
of
your
products
but
this
rushed
release
to
compete
with
bud
lit
wheat
really
should
have
been
retooled
i
wanted
it
to
taste
like
the
hefewiezen
or
summer
ale
but
it
didnt
and
that
makes
me
sad
pours
slightly
hazy
with
a
decent
head
that
recedes
fairly
slowly
and
leaves
some
light
lacing
the
lemon
flavor
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
taste
is
primarily
of
wheat
with
the
lemon
adding
a
nice
taste
near
the
end
mouthfeel
is
perhaps
a
little
chewier
than
typical
for
the
style
overall
a
nice
beer
but
out
of
place
in
a
winter
variety
pack
exactly
what
was
expected
from
this
beer
a
good
buy
to
experiment
with
and
an
enjoyable
drink
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
has
a
bit
of
lacing
and
decent
head
retention
d
its
flavorful
and
enjoyable
especially
for
a
hot
summer
day
id
imagine
seems
strange
they
would
release
it
with
winter
just
around
the
corner
a
good
beer
nonetheless
it
has
admirable
qualities
for
what
it
is
nicely
crafted
and
easy
to
drink
wow
this
was
a
let
down
i
wasnt
even
expecting
much
but
how
mediocre
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
there
was
maybe
a
14
of
bubbly
white
foam
that
held
on
for
a
little
while
no
lacing
the
color
was
gold
and
very
seethrough
seems
odd
to
me
for
a
wheat
beer
only
a
slight
haze
the
smell
was
very
faint
oranges
and
lemon
the
taste
was
even
more
faint
its
hard
to
even
tell
this
is
a
wheat
beer
theres
virtually
no
body
carbonation
is
zip
i
guess
drinkability
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
its
about
as
drinkable
as
a
glass
of
water
with
lemon
this
sucks
because
i
like
sam
adams
apart
from
this
d
this
beer
is
a
wheat
ale
and
what
i
like
about
it
is
that
there
are
no
spices
added
to
the
beer
like
in
their
summer
ale
which
to
me
hurts
the
drinkability
of
beer
that
is
designed
to
be
refreshing
my
only
question
is
why
they
released
it
in
the
winter
when
people
are
craving
big
thick
and
dark
beers
d
a
worthwhile
experiment
that
is
ultimately
not
all
that
interesting
a
good
crossover
beer
perhaps
interesting
offering
from
sa
pours
the
expected
bubbly
pale
wheat
with
a
nice
initial
head
smells
inviting
light
lemon
and
wheat
notes
that
are
fully
revealed
in
less
balanced
form
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
not
thin
but
the
texture
seems
with
its
bubbliness
soapy
still
you
could
knock
these
out
all
day
in
the
spring
some
coconut
shrimp
would
go
well
with
these
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
nice
appearance
but
pretty
standard
for
this
style
nose
is
okay
but
theres
a
strange
soapy
aroma
thats
pretty
offputting
flavor
is
subtle
all
the
way
around
overall
this
is
a
decent
quaff
d
surprisingly
the
second
flavor
in
this
variety
pack
i
am
going
to
have
to
say
no
thanks
to
bummer
a
brew
that
would
go
much
better
as
a
summer
offering
but
i
guess
they
threw
it
in
as
a
light
winter
or
they
didnt
want
it
to
compete
against
their
own
summer
ale
which
i
enjoyed
more
than
this
one
i
would
much
rather
see
a
return
of
the
scotch
ale
to
be
honest
whatever
the
case
may
be
its
a
decent
pale
wheat
and
thats
what
it
is
ignore
the
descriptor
on
label
that
claims
it
to
be
in
the
traditional
hw
style
with
or
without
a
twist
its
not
but
neither
had
been
their
hw
and
this
is
something
of
a
step
up
from
their
hw
which
this
replaced
overall
jim
had
to
of
been
drunk
when
he
put
this
one
on
the
list
for
the
winter
variety
pack
because
this
one
sticks
out
like
a
sore
thumb
among
the
other
brews
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
medium
yellow
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
that
faded
fast
this
has
a
huge
lemon
smell
with
smaller
smells
that
are
masked
by
the
lemon
the
flavor
starts
with
a
mild
lemon
moves
to
a
light
hefe
flavor
then
finishes
strong
with
the
lemon
taste
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
this
has
a
light
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
but
not
balance
most
sam
adams
beers
have
just
heavy
on
the
lemon
peel
i
cant
imagine
having
more
than
a
few
i
am
unsure
why
this
is
in
a
winter
pack
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
not
the
best
could
have
been
so
much
better
the
coastal
wheat
pours
a
nice
cloudy
orange
with
little
to
no
head
worth
mentioning
the
scents
ooze
citrus
and
yeasty
notes
the
lemon
is
very
obvious
and
the
sweetness
accompanies
the
lemon
flavor
nicely
not
too
overbearing
i
usually
dont
enjoy
fruity
beers
so
much
but
this
worked
quite
nicely
will
probably
purchase
again
individually
from
the
holiday
samplers
smell
is
very
reminiscent
of
the
cherry
wheat
made
by
sam
adams
also
must
be
a
similar
yeast
strain
slightly
sweet
yeast
and
wheat
malt
stands
out
fruity
and
light
first
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
citrus
and
malt
notes
slightly
spicy
light
mouthfeel
some
lacing
finish
is
clean
yeasty
profile
sticks
for
minute
afterwords
not
bad
drinkability
this
is
sessionable
light
and
lemony
it
is
very
much
their
blackberry
wit
minus
the
blackberries
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
pours
a
nice
golden
sunny
yellow
with
some
decent
initial
head
and
some
nice
lacing
very
sweet
and
malty
scent
nice
wheat
aromas
and
has
a
large
citrus
ping
in
the
nose
nice
taste
very
balanced
with
the
wheat
being
the
strongest
flavor
malty
which
is
followed
by
a
nice
lemon
burst
and
ends
with
a
slight
hoppiness
at
the
end
couldnt
place
the
hops
goes
down
great
would
make
a
better
summer
beer
than
a
winter
beer
but
still
a
good
fruited
wheat
overall
this
beer
in
the
winter
variety
was
a
big
surprise
not
a
winter
beer
for
me
doesnt
fit
the
season
very
much
it
is
drinkable
but
i
am
not
diggin
what
sa
did
with
this
one
a
drinkable
wheat
beer
from
sam
adams
very
unoffensive
and
worthy
of
sessioning
got
this
one
from
a
winter
variety
pack
it
pours
a
nice
golden
color
in
the
glass
the
aggressive
lemon
smell
reminds
me
of
cleaning
solution
the
taste
isnt
too
far
off
this
beer
seems
to
have
been
a
well
intentioned
attempt
at
adding
something
simple
and
refreshing
to
a
variety
pack
the
execution
just
isnt
there
every
sip
reminded
me
of
chemicals
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
not
overthetop
but
more
mellow
the
citrus
character
is
probably
the
most
unique
part
of
the
flavor
not
quite
the
style
of
beer
i
prefer
but
considering
it
is
a
lighter
beer
its
not
too
bad
where
the
hell
did
this
beer
come
from
i
saw
no
promotions
or
advertising
for
it
but
sure
enough
its
sitting
in
my
beer
stores
cooler
frankly
its
pretty
boring
nothing
you
havent
tasted
before
particularly
from
this
brewery
just
a
run
of
the
mill
light
bodied
lemon
flavored
wheat
how
was
this
beer
decided
on
when
trying
to
put
a
new
beer
in
their
winter
seasonal
must
have
been
a
big
sale
on
lemons
somewhere
i
love
ya
sa
but
i
dont
like
the
cut
of
this
ones
jib
sam
adams
is
very
good
at
making
a
wide
variety
of
styles
but
this
beer
should
never
have
made
it
to
the
shelves
perhaps
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
cold
glass
of
coastal
wheat
might
be
welcome
but
i
honestly
doubt
id
be
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
to
fill
that
bill
sam
adams
brews
a
number
of
my
favorite
beers
but
coastal
wheat
is
not
one
of
them
overall
mediocre
not
bad
a
better
beer
than
the
score
would
indicate
but
a
few
shortcomings
keep
it
down
worth
trying
for
sure
and
it
may
not
be
a
bad
beer
to
choose
as
an
inspiration
for
homebrewers
unique
and
interesting
with
room
to
improve
d
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
sure
if
i
want
to
whats
the
point
here
of
all
the
fruits
to
make
a
beer
with
lemon
is
probably
the
least
interesting
i
think
the
much
maligned
cranberry
lambic
is
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
this
the
lemon
peel
was
too
acidic
and
bitter
and
maybe
lemon
juice
would
have
been
better
and
its
totally
out
of
place
in
this
season
its
a
baffling
choice
as
theres
no
shortage
of
fruitwheat
sam
adams
beers
all
of
which
are
better
than
this
to
my
knowledge
final
thoughts
i
expect
much
more
from
sam
adams
they
already
have
a
summer
ale
and
a
hefeweizen
why
are
they
pulling
this
crapper
out
furthermore
why
is
this
in
the
winter
seasonal
pack
d
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
offering
but
its
decent
it
definitely
doesnt
stand
out
from
any
other
wheat
beer
ive
had
drink
this
one
a
little
on
the
colder
side
and
enjoy
the
citric
sweetness
and
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
i
wasnt
happy
with
this
beer
i
wasnt
upset
either
im
a
big
sam
adams
fan
but
this
beer
didnt
meet
the
style
very
well
itd
be
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
but
i
dont
see
why
it
was
included
in
the
holiday
pack
d
very
drinkable
as
in
you
could
put
several
back
and
not
notice
but
im
a
little
disappointed
mainly
because
of
the
lack
of
aroma
and
because
ive
learned
to
expect
better
from
sam
adams
and
why
is
this
in
the
winter
collection
goes
down
easy
but
it
just
isnt
all
that
great
tastewise
or
smell
not
sure
why
this
is
part
of
the
winter
sampler
as
it
would
make
a
perfect
summer
quaffer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
the
summer
as
a
switch
up
from
more
traditional
hefes
and
wheat
ales
pours
a
very
hazy
gold
think
of
a
much
cloudier
budweiser
the
smell
is
very
citrusy
more
lemon
than
oranges
dominate
the
smell
reminds
me
of
lemonade
or
possibly
a
shandy
after
my
first
taste
ive
concluded
that
it
also
tastes
like
a
shandy
or
a
radler
tart
more
than
bitter
this
might
be
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
from
sam
adams
and
ive
had
everything
they
put
into
six
and
twelve
packs
should
be
taken
out
of
their
lineup
ive
had
far
worse
beers
but
they
have
so
many
other
option
available
i
dont
know
anyone
who
will
be
head
over
heels
for
this
t
coastal
wheat
is
a
disappointing
effort
from
bbc
theres
simply
not
enough
flavor
to
call
this
one
a
success
it
needs
something
to
kick
the
flavor
up
a
notch
hops
spices
whatever
it
isnt
a
total
disaster
but
could
use
some
work
its
probably
worth
a
try
but
it
wont
ever
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
d
not
too
heavy
so
i
could
definitely
have
quite
a
few
and
not
be
full
the
taste
has
a
touch
of
nuttiness
in
there
there
is
some
flat
lemon
flavors
nothing
particularly
tangy
there
is
a
slight
prickly
feel
on
the
tongue
from
the
wheatiness
there
is
some
raw
graininess
to
the
beer
that
helps
add
something
to
an
otherwise
pretty
mediocre
beer
there
is
this
cardboard
like
nuttiness
that
is
quite
off
putting
the
beer
gets
a
teeny
bit
better
as
it
settles
but
why
wait
just
go
on
and
grab
something
else
besides
this
one
you
can
do
much
better
d
reminds
me
heavily
of
the
rossen
or
was
it
called
rosser
i
drank
in
munich
which
is
hefeweizen
mixed
with
lemon
soda
this
beer
is
light
and
goes
down
easy
but
thats
about
all
thats
going
for
it
an
ok
experiment
on
the
part
of
sa
but
not
worth
a
revisit
d
the
abv
is
modest
and
the
flavors
are
nonoffensive
so
this
is
technically
highly
drinkable
yet
i
dont
want
another
nuff
said
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
with
a
one
inch
frothy
white
head
smells
mainly
of
wheaty
lemon
and
orange
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
hints
of
lemon
and
orange
with
a
light
wheat
maltiness
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
some
light
carbonation
overall
its
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
it
beats
the
cranberry
lambic
but
nothing
particularly
exciting
going
on
here
i
cant
help
but
compare
this
to
their
cherry
wheat
and
summer
ale
both
of
which
they
did
a
much
better
job
on
this
is
a
pretty
average
wheat
beer
wouldve
preferred
to
see
the
cream
stout
in
the
mixed
12
again
this
year
a
wheat
beer
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
season
unless
its
the
imperial
white
drinkability
is
quite
good
tasty
clean
very
drinkable
this
isnt
a
geeks
beer
its
about
as
simple
and
straightforward
as
it
comes
and
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
a
german
hefe
imo
but
tasty
for
what
it
is
but
still
a
really
odd
choice
for
the
winter
pack
they
should
shove
that
in
the
summer
or
spring
pack
and
replace
that
with
a
more
seasonallyappropriate
number
for
the
winter
d
not
very
good
im
finding
myself
struggling
to
finish
this
one
and
not
looking
forward
to
the
other
one
i
have
left
heres
hoping
it
wont
be
in
2010s
winter
classics
pack
overall
impression
meh
im
not
thrilled
to
have
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
avoid
i
wouldnt
search
this
out
on
its
own
but
it
came
in
a
mix
pack
so
ill
drink
it
overall
this
would
be
an
ok
summer
thirst
quencher
but
nothing
great
drinkability
refreshing
and
enjoyable
but
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
great
beer
for
a
summer
day
which
begs
the
question
what
the
hell
is
it
doing
in
the
winter
mixpack
this
is
one
sam
adams
that
falls
flat
on
its
face
why
it
is
included
in
the
winter
classics
12pack
is
beyond
me
downright
one
of
the
worst
wheathefeweizen
style
beers
ive
had
stronger
carb
than
i
would
have
liked
medium
bodied
could
see
drinking
this
in
the
summer
time
but
was
included
in
the
winter
pack
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
of
lemon
peel
and
a
hint
of
malt
taste
is
tart
citrus
up
front
yeasty
and
malty
in
the
middle
and
a
tart
slightly
sour
lemon
finish
that
fades
into
oblivion
mouthfeel
is
not
very
hot
either
somewhat
watery
carbonation
levels
are
fine
though
drinkability
is
decent
the
lemon
flavor
gets
to
you
though
after
awhile
this
limits
the
drinkability
bbc
makes
much
better
beers
in
general
though
this
one
isnt
too
bad
seems
way
out
of
place
in
a
winter
pack
though
drinkability
relatively
drinkable
although
inappropriately
placed
in
the
winter
classics
it
worked
fine
today
because
i
was
outside
reading
in
the
califronia
sun
and
this
was
actually
quite
refreshing
when
i
came
in
now
to
wait
for
it
to
get
a
little
bit
colder
and
crack
open
an
ole
fezziwig
d
i
was
nervous
that
this
would
be
a
cherry
wheat
or
cranberry
lambicesque
clone
with
a
borderline
cloying
fruit
flavor
thankfully
it
isnt
this
is
a
perfectly
serviceable
pale
wheat
ale
although
it
doesnt
really
separate
itself
from
the
rest
of
a
muddled
pack
d
another
solid
you
know
c
wheat
beer
that
sam
adams
makes
nothing
offensive
and
some
interesting
flavours
dont
know
why
it
was
in
the
winter
mix
pack
but
it
could
be
refreshing
on
a
high
pressure
november
day
after
working
outside
tough
to
finish
there
is
too
much
wheat
too
much
lemon
and
the
puckering
yeast
dryness
is
offputting
certainly
a
lesser
offering
from
bbc
drinks
easy
but
not
than
a
thirst
quencher
not
impressed
regardless
great
brew
that
ill
continue
to
enjoy
not
sure
id
say
this
is
a
apwa
but
more
of
a
spiced
beer
either
way
a
solid
offering
probably
a
gateway
beer
for
those
people
who
think
that
blue
moon
is
adventurous
d
not
bad
nothing
special
here
really
just
seems
like
a
slightly
tweaked
version
of
the
summer
ale
without
the
soapy
taste
i
wouldnt
refuse
a
free
one
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
this
one
looks
impressive
a
nice
pillowy
white
head
sits
atop
a
hazy
straw
colored
body
smells
very
lemony
some
notes
of
banana
and
wheat
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
round
things
out
but
man
that
citrus
is
pretty
overpowering
the
lemon
doesnt
run
as
rampant
in
the
taste
as
the
wheat
really
begins
to
assert
itself
i
love
the
playful
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
it
leaves
me
feeling
like
i
ate
a
delicious
cracker
im
not
sure
that
makes
sense
but
its
hard
to
describe
it
kind
of
has
an
acidic
drying
effect
and
as
it
warms
it
takes
on
a
surprisingly
buttery
characteristic
certainly
an
interesting
brew
but
the
acidity
gets
a
little
harsh
in
the
back
of
the
throat
so
it
loses
some
points
for
drinkability
im
sure
ill
come
back
to
this
at
some
point
another
solid
sa
offering
certainly
nothing
special
but
id
buy
it
again
maybe
next
time
the
lady
will
get
to
have
one
maybe
not
drinkability
well
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
it
wasnt
bad
there
just
wasnt
much
to
it
that
being
said
i
dont
usually
like
wheat
beers
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
agree
with
some
of
the
other
views
that
its
a
bit
surprising
to
find
this
in
a
winter
mix
pack
this
is
something
id
enjoy
by
the
pool
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
though
the
beer
is
off
season
its
a
nice
welcome
that
should
do
well
with
the
blue
mooners
and
golden
wheateers
looking
for
a
step
up
but
for
the
serious
craft
beer
lover
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
onedimentional
expecially
with
all
the
porters
stouts
and
barleywines
to
be
consumed
this
fall
and
winter
i
would
have
preferred
to
see
a
kölsch
style
or
blonde
ale
filtered
with
more
of
a
sweetsour
lemon
edge
not
too
far
off
from
other
beers
they
brew
they
brew
a
wit
beerywits
the
summer
ale
and
now
a
lemon
version
is
this
reactionary
to
the
cloudy
beers
that
have
come
from
the
bigger
breweries
the
feel
this
beer
is
pretty
light
a
beer
that
does
not
weight
your
mouth
down
with
too
much
makes
for
a
pretty
good
session
beer
and
a
good
summer
beer
as
well
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
is
nice
on
a
hot
day
drinkable
and
rather
average
overall
not
quite
sure
why
sam
adams
decided
to
add
this
beer
to
their
portfolio
though
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
colored
haze
nice
looking
beer
and
has
a
good
full
head
that
leaves
lacing
in
the
sam
adams
tradition
it
is
a
good
looking
beer
that
is
where
it
ends
however
extremely
hard
to
finish
has
oftkilter
flavours
tastes
as
if
lemons
were
added
instead
of
malted
very
unbalanced
sam
adams
cannot
make
a
good
hefe
and
i
dont
know
why
need
to
fill
the
holiday
classics
packs
with
more
fezzelwig
and
holiday
porter
cause
those
are
outstanding
this
one
is
not
a
good
one
tried
this
at
a
distributor
trade
show
and
was
shocked
how
bad
this
beer
is
especially
from
illustrious
samuel
adams
i
do
not
know
what
they
were
aiming
at
here
but
this
is
one
sam
adams
than
can
easily
be
skipped
this
stuff
makes
leinenkugels
shandy
look
good
take
some
ordinary
beer
and
add
lemon
juice
and
i
think
you
could
obtain
better
results
this
was
truly
shocking
and
not
in
a
good
way
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
crisp
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
lemony
zest
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
highly
drinkable
pale
wheat
flavor
with
a
dry
lemony
finish
it
has
a
moderate
hefe
yeast
character
its
light
with
a
nice
citrus
touch
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tastey
beer
i
dont
know
why
its
in
the
winter
collection
but
id
buy
this
one
again
the
dry
crisp
but
full
body
of
apwas
drinkabliilty
is
not
bad
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
would
probably
be
good
on
a
summer
day
which
is
why
i
dont
feel
that
it
have
should
have
been
placed
in
the
winter
classics
pack
its
fairly
good
but
not
something
id
make
a
run
for
drinkability
sufficient
enough
for
the
one
bottle
though
i
doubt
ill
be
revisiting
this
particular
offering
is
it
replacing
the
samuel
adams
summer
ale
if
not
i
fail
to
see
the
need
for
the
addition
of
another
mild
wheat
beer
to
their
lineup
ah
well
cest
la
wheat
d
this
is
a
nice
wheat
ale
it
would
make
a
great
summerlawnmower
beer
extremely
drinkable
but
whats
the
motive
behind
this
beer
its
rather
reminiscent
of
the
brewerys
summer
ale
or
a
touchedup
sam
adams
hefeweizen
nothing
outstanding
or
very
distinctive
and
certainly
not
really
deserving
of
being
inserted
into
the
winter
classics
pack
its
understandable
why
this
wasnt
heavily
marketed
theres
nothing
especially
new
about
it
a
solid
beer
no
doubt
but
a
bit
boring
and
released
in
a
lessthanopportune
season
beer
had
a
nice
hazy
golden
color
and
a
lemony
aroma
the
initial
taste
to
me
mirrored
the
aroma
but
like
i
said
before
i
swear
i
get
peppermint
in
the
finish
overall
i
liked
it
very
good
beer
jim
why
did
you
replace
the
hefe
which
was
not
a
hefe
but
an
american
wheat
with
another
american
wheat
why
not
make
a
real
hefeweizen
i
dont
get
it
replace
your
hefe
that
was
actually
an
american
wheat
to
an
american
wheat
with
lemon
peels
why
not
do
a
real
german
style
hefeweizen
to
join
the
party
of
cherry
wheat
double
white
white
ale
dunkelweizen
and
summer
thats
alot
of
wheat
beer
maybe
its
time
to
do
a
different
style
how
about
an
ipa
pale
hazed
golden
orange
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
leaves
behind
speckled
lacing
aroma
has
a
biscuit
malt
character
a
lot
of
yeast
nuttiness
with
citrus
peels
apparent
not
much
sweetness
or
hops
going
on
here
pretty
abrasive
with
lemon
peel
zest
bitterrness
and
tart
wheat
blended
with
that
nasty
dry
nutty
yeast
notes
mouthfeel
overall
is
pretty
harsh
with
the
carbonation
levels
just
an
unpleasant
experience
with
the
lemonpeel
left
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
drinkability
is
poor
this
is
one
that
should
be
skipped
and
i
enjoy
most
of
the
sam
adams
brews
out
there
drinkability
is
ok
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
as
a
single
but
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
the
winter
12
mix
if
it
was
still
summer
i
can
see
this
beer
going
down
easier
on
a
hot
day
but
the
lemon
was
a
bit
much
seems
to
fit
in
with
my
opinion
of
other
sam
adams
beers
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
offensive
enough
to
make
it
undrinkable
id
much
sooner
pick
up
their
white
ale
or
imperial
white
i
would
probably
not
get
one
of
these
again
unless
it
was
presented
to
me
as
a
surprise
with
a
bow
on
it
not
recommended
not
terrible
but
not
worth
seeking
out
ive
tried
over
40
of
sas
brews
many
of
which
are
wheat
beers
they
just
dont
seem
to
have
a
handle
on
light
colored
wheats
even
a
shocktop
with
a
lemon
twist
has
more
character
it
pains
me
to
say
that
their
dark
wheats
fare
much
better
d
a
little
too
sweet
and
bubbly
for
my
tastes
if
not
probably
best
to
stick
with
one
of
the
imported
wheat
beers
drinkability
i
was
surprised
when
i
found
this
in
the
store
since
i
had
no
idea
it
was
coming
out
its
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
anything
groundbreaking
from
this
beer
taste
also
awesome
in
the
taste
department
it
kinda
reminds
me
of
leinenkugel
sunset
wheat
with
its
sugary
fruitiness
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
a
hazy
pale
orange
color
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
it
had
a
strong
citrus
aroma
as
well
as
crackerlike
aroma
the
citrus
aroma
did
not
translate
to
the
taste
however
only
a
very
subtle
lemon
taste
and
the
aforementioned
cracker
i
thought
this
beer
was
on
the
tepid
sideand
not
something
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
dont
really
understand
the
thinking
behind
this
new
release
from
sam

if
you
want
to
put
out
an
american
wheat
why
not
just
make
summer
ale
a
year
around
beer
in
my
opinion
its
a
significantly
better
beer
than
this
one
id
like
to
see
brewing
companies
with
the
stability
and
means
of
boston
beer
company
to
push
the
boundaries
of
beer
rather
than
continue
to
release
dumbeddown
versions
of
already
overbrewed
styles
i
can
see
myself
revisiting
this
as
its
another
pleasant
offering
from
sam
adams
its
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
them
a
solid
beer
with
some
good
flavor
overly
yeasty
im
not
a
fan
of
wheat
ales
and
this
one
does
nothing
to
change
my
mind
about
the
style
12oz
brown
bottle
purchased
at
hannaford
in
derry
pours
a
murky
dark
straw
color
with
a
half
inch
of
off
white
that
slowly
dissipated
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
scents
of
lemon
pulp
juice
and
zest
lemon
lemon
lemon
lemon
across
the
board
tastes
of
lemon
juice
it
tastes
like
the
brewer
poured
a
bottle
of
pure
lemon
juice
into
the
batch
and
you
cant
even
taste
the
malts
at
all
moderately
carbonated
lemon
lemon

12oz
brown
bottle
obtained
at
hannaford
in
derry
pours
a
murky
golden
yellow
body
with
nearly
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
somewhat
quickly
smells
very
lemony
and
pithy
with
just
a
hint
of
vanilla
tastes
rather
lemony
too
with
pith
and
zest
joining
juice
in
the
flavor
mediumbodied
with
moderate
carbonation
relatively
drinkable
not
bad
but
rather
onedimensional
and
the
lemon
gets
to
be
a
little
much
after
a
while
one
was
more
than
enough
for
me
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
nice
white
head
not
much
retentionbut
decent
lacing
aroma
is
of
citrus
with
bready
and
yeasty
undertones
body
is
medium
and
carbonated
taste
is
yeasty
up
front
with
a
nice
fruity
finish
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
sa
does
it
again
very
similar
across
the
board
to
a
hefeweizen
plus
the
lemon
bonus
very
very
drinkable
im
not
sure
how
many
more
wheat
beers
bbc
needs
in
their
lineup
but
this
spot
could
have
gone
to
a
more
interesting
beer
rather
than
a
bland
american
wheat
d
id
really
have
to
be
eating
something
bbq
and
definitely
in
the
summertime
to
put
this
one
down
regularly
instead
of
rebranding
the
hefeweizen
i
think
they
just
made
something
closer
to
sam
adams
summer
ale
to
have
offseason
or
year
round
a
decent
hot
weather
brew
just
take
a
pepcid
or
something
beforehand
i
got
about
half
way
through
the
glass
could
do
without
seeing
this
one
waiting
for
me
again
pours
a
four
finger
offwhite
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
some
lace
cloudy
pale
amber
color
lemon
rind
nose
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
flavor
is

lemon
rind
not
the
usual

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
manchester
wine
and
liquors
manchester
ct
so
new
it
isnt
listed
yet
on
their
site
it
offers
yeasty
bread
aromas
and
flavors
and
a
hint
of
banana
there
is
nice
depth
from
the
wheat
but
not
a
lot
of
spice
although
it
does
not
have
an
immense
amount
of
flavor
it
is
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
basically
an
average
at
best
wheat
beer
nothing
about
it
really
stands
out
as
being
outstanding
and
that
funky
taste
in
it
doesnt
help
i
got
this
as
part
of
a
make
your
own
six
pack
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
more
glad
i
dont
have
5
more
of
the
same
to
drink
to
me
this
has
to
be
the
first
beer
i
have
or
it
just
gets
overwhelmed
by
whatever
i
drank
prior
to
it
it
also
wears
thin
on
my
buds
after
two
or
three
but
for
two
or
three
when
thristy
this
is
a
good
option
and
a
solid
version
of
an
american
wheat
really
how
did
this
one
ever
get
brewed
for
production
if
someone
told
me
the
goal
of
the
brewer
was
to
make
a
replica
of
corona
i
would
have
believed
them
capital
is
one
of
the
top
brewers
in
the
nation
which
is
why
i
was
shocked
by
this
lame
beer
it
is
what
it
was
meant
to
be
a
refreshing
pale
wheat
ale
while
its
still
basic
it
has
more
character
to
it
wheat
malt
is
wellused
and
just
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
yet
has
a
dryish
finish
very
sessionable
o
overall
a
little
above
average
i
appreciate
the
gift
all
the
way
from
wi
thanks
t
i
am
sure
i
have
had
this
beer
before
since
it
is
local
but
i
have
never
sat
down
to
actually
review
it
unfortunately
for
the
low
abv
this
beer
was
way
too
much
work
to
drink
what
i
mean
by
that
is
i
dont
even
mind
that
it
is
pretty
low
in
alcohol
content
but
it
wasnt
really
that
easy
drinking
of
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
harsh
and
it
felt
like
there
was
a
bunch
of
stuff
forced
into
the
taste
of
this
beer
speaking
of
the
taste
there
was
definitely
wheat
present
along
with
some
fruit
and
light
hops
not
a
great
drinking
experience
o
a
tasty
wheat
ale
that
offers
up
a
traditional
flavour
profile
for
the
style
nothing
over
the
top
but
easily
sessioned
and
a
perfect
summer
patio
ale
island
wheat
pours
a
clear
bright
straw
color
with
a
good
size
head
there
is
a
slightly
skunk
aroma
with
some
hints
grainy
wheat
the
taste
is
crisp
clean
good
full
wheat
flavors
with
hints
of
a
carmalized
malts
not
watery
full
flavor
a
little
too
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
solid
wheat
ale
clean
and
crisp
but
on
the
lighter
side
overall
a
pretty
decent
take
on
the
wheat
ale
style
some
nice
citrus
character
nice
summer
option
body
is
light
with
fairly
high
carbonation
creating
a
crisp
sparkling
mouthfeel
with
some
slight
prickliness
across
the
palate
closes
out
with
a
semidry
finish
leaving
some
lingering
sweetness
and
stickiness
on
the
palate
o
i
really
like
this
beer
i
think
this
was
a
great
addition
to
capitals
repertoire
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
refreshing
its
not
necessarily
going
to
blow
the
doors
off
of
anyone
but
it
is
very
consistent
and
always
been
good
to
me
grab
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
enjoy
overall
this
beer
is
a
poor
example
of
the
style
and
is
more
so
fermented
lemon
juice
i
enjoy
good
wheat
ales
and
this
is
one
i
would
have
as
a
last
resort
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
poundable
lighter
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
o
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
especially
enjoyable
on
a
warm
day
this
beer
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
yellowish
body
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
grainy
with
not
fruit
smell
the
taste
is
a
little
better
some
wheat
taste
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
and
overall
is
a
average
beer
good
for
the
summer
mild
beer
that
wont
knock
anybodys
socks
off
good
summer
beer
but
overall
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
by
it
gets
a
c
drinkable
passable
thats
about
it
dont
know
how
many
islands
there
are
in
the
lakes
surrounding
madison
but
im
pretty
sure
that
not
much
wheat
would
grow
there
regardless
still
this
stuff
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
puffed
rice
and
the
vague
notion
of
lemon
peel
the
taste
holds
notes
of
damp
wheat
grass
musty
lemon
rind
and
light
powdered
sugar
something
very
unappealing
about
this
flavor
combination
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
watery
feel
overall
a
weak
beer
allaround
one
ill
probably
never
seek
out
again
drinkability
this
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
with
so
many
real
bavarian
wheat
beers
available
i
have
no
clue
why
i
should
even
bother
with
the
pale
american
versions
it
is
definitely
drinkable
and
true
to
style
but
it
lacks
the
flavor
and
aroma
experience
i
want
from
wheat
beer
so
i
suppose
sometimes
less
is
more
is
not
the
best
idea
average
not
must
have
o
not
the
best
of
this
style
i
have
tried
but
nothings
wrong
here
certainly
a
candidate
for
a
session
brew
and
a
good
effort
d
i
dont
think
i
would
choose
this
beer
for
this
purpose
but
its
definitely
a
summer
beer
that
you
could
put
back
a
bunch
of
as
a
session
with
light
character
oa
good
microbrew
style
wheat
that
is
nice
to
get
a
12
pack
of
cans
to
enjoy
at
home
or
for
packing
a
cooler
a
nice
alternative
to
a
lot
of
the
domestics
another
winner
from
capitali
hope
they
keep
this
one
around
wisconsin
wisconsin
where
for
art
tho
wisconsin
oh
a
lil
capital
brewing
after
a
hard
fought
hockey
game
and
thats
what
im
talking
about
this
beer
is
cloudy
yellow
with
decent
head
the
hints
of
lemoncitrus
hit
the
nose
nicely
the
taste
is
very
good
nice
wheat
balanced
with
lemoncitrus
the
mouthfeel
is
easy
and
i
could
mown
the
lawn
all
day
with
this
beer
enjoy
ill
have
to
check
after
im
done
writing
but
i
thought
capital
was
all
about
lagers
but
this
is
certainly
a
nice
light
filtered
wheat
brew
this
wasnt
bad
at
all
pretty
well
done
little
hoppy
wheat
beer
here
that
had
some
kick
to
it
but
the
wheat
and
citrus
gave
this
a
sweet
smoothness
that
coupled
with
the
crisp
feel
to
keep
this
quite
quaffable
thanks
to
resi
for
the
trade
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
and
citrus
taste
is
a
bit
of
sour
lemon
up
front
some
wheat
and
grains
not
bad
but
nothing
special
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
drinks
great
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
afternoon
no
alcohol
flavor
to
speak
of
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
simple
and
well
made
recommended
although
island
wheat
no
doubt
will
not
appeal
to
folks
who
like
bigger
bolder
and
hoppier
entries
in
the
apwa
style
segment
id
say
its
a
hell
of
a
beer
to
have
around
when
a
thirstslaking
wheat
is
what
the
doctor
ordered
the
fact
that
this
one
is
available
in
12
pack
cans
will
have
me
seeking
it
out
over
e
g
blue
moon
wittekerke
the
next
time
i
head
out
to
throw
some
discs
with
friends
directly
after
the
crack
glug
i
felt
as
though
i
were
looking
at
lemon
meringue
pie
in
a
glass
the
liquid
was
a
hazy
lemonyellow
and
the
fingerandahalf
of
foam
was
thick
and
bonewhite
beautiful
nose
had
a
peppery
tang
to
it
and
suddenly
my
mouth
was
watering
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
there
were
flavors
of
lemon
and
pepper
on
the
tongue
but
both
in
mild
forms
refreshing
indeed
i
spent
the
day
in
a
humid
classroom
at
the
end
of
the
hall
because
one
or
more
of
my
jagov
colleagues
opened
their
windows
defeating
the
central
ac
what
i
wouldnt
have
given
for
one
of
these
beers
out
of
a
cooler
at
lunchtime
sadly
as
a
high
school
english
teacher
beer
is
frowned
upon
in
the
building
i
had
to
wait
until
i
got
home
but
it
was
worth
the
wait
i
would
not
want
a
steady
diet
of
island
wheat
but
a
couplefew
on
a
humid
day
would
really
cure
what
ales
me
d
a
solid
refreshing
beer
lightbodied
with
some
good
flavors
a
great
session
brew
to
have
around
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
typical
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
each
sip
seems
to
make
this
brew
come
across
a
bit
watery
in
the
feel
but
overall
it
isnt
bad
this
isnt
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
is
certainly
something
you
sit
down
and
have
a
few
of
on
a
hot
day
i
enjoyed
the
island
wheat
beer
from
capital
brewery
it
is
a
light
wheat
beer
comparable
to
something
like
boulevard
wheat
it
is
a
light
shade
of
gold
almost
yellow
you
can
detect
a
bit
of
citrus
in
the
smell
and
taste
my
girlfriend
really
liked
this
beer
so
i
would
say
the
drinkability
is
very
high
as
well
this
beer
wont
blow
your
mind
but
it
is
definitely
worth
the
try
d
a
run
of
the
mill
beer
that
could
be
a
good
lawnmower
beer
now
that
it
comes
in
a
can
nothing
really
spectacular
about
this
beer
average
all
around
pours
a
nice
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
twofinger
fizzy
white
head
with
some
nice
sticky
lacing
to
follow
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
yeastgrass
notes
slightly
spiced
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
yeastygrassy
a
slight

note
lightmedium
body
drinkable
a
nice
thirst
quencher
easy
to
drink
finishes
easily
but
not
too
much
happening
here
whats
there
doesnt
taste
bad
at
all
its
just
that
theres
barely
anything
there
would
definitely
make
for
an
easy
summer
drinker
if
it
was
cold
d
fits
well
with
the
style
which
is
to
say
most
though
not
all
apwas
are
simple
mediocre
and
designed
to
convert
the
macro
drinkers
palate
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
premium
lawnmower
beer
though
d
great
this
beer
didnt
let
me
down
at
all
im
not
a
real
big
fan
of
the
brewery
at
all
but
this
beer
is
really
good
smooth
and
crisp
nice
wheat
forward
beer
with
great
flavors
and
still
lets
the
wheat
take
the
front
seat
awesome
job
ill
but
this
again
any
day
i
got
a
cravin
for
a
wheat
i
bring
it
home
crack
one
open
and
i
think
i
like
it
better
from
a
can
than
a
bottle
very
mild
very
drinkable
i
could
probably
put
a
few
of
these
away
in
a
sitting
if
it
was
better
available
down
here
taste
rather
enjoyable
for
such
a
typically
bland
style
anyways
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
d
the
only
time
i
ever
see
myself
wanting
this
beer
ever
again
is
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
i
need
a
refreshing
brew
it
really
lacks
in
flavor
there
is
next
to
nothing
there
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
for
a
wheat
beer
its
incredibly
refreshing
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
yeast
pale
malt
wheat
and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
wheat
yeast
pale
malt
and
slight
citrus
overall
refreshing
but
lacking
body
and
complexity
d
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
though
not
a
very
complex
one
easy
drinker
for
a
summer
day
d
a
nice
sessionable
beer
that
would
be
great
on
a
summer
day
out
on
the
lake
i
cant
imagine
the
alcohol
being
all
that
high
but
it
would
still
be
nice
to
know
what
i
am
dealing
with
here
433
534
overall
a
nice
session
beer
for
my
taste
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
these
this
certainly
isnt
the
spotted
cowkiller
they
were
hoping
it
would
be
but
its
a
welcome
alternative
to
the
more
unadventurous
and
commercially
viable
pale
wheats
out
there
conclusion
this
is
an
average
american
wheat
the
only
thing
that
puts
it
slightly
over
others
like
it
is
the
floral
notes
on
the
finish
a
great
example
of
the
sytle
be
sure
to
check
it
out
when
the
weather
gets
warm
twistoff
cap
pours
a
vivid
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white

pungent
grains
present

the
nose
both
sweet
and
bitter
yeasty
grassy
nothing
special
nothing
bad
grassy
and
bitter
to
taste
fading
into
a
macrostyle
sweetness
though
not
in
a
terribly
overpowering
way
bitter
again
with
a
hint
of
skunk
at
the
end
meh
good
carbonation
not
a
highly
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
much
pours
an
interesting
very
pale
goldenstraw
color
slightly
cloudy
and
a
thin
white
head
with
good
retention
smells
like
a
lighter
strain
of
wheat
and
northern
yeast
backed
by
a
mild
orange
citrus
and
a
tiny
bit
of
the
characteristic
banana
you
find
in
wheat
ales
overall
the
nose
is
very
fresh
and
appealing
first
taste
is
mellow
yeast
and
wheat
with
the
citrus
gently
blended
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hopping
the
round
it
out
the
citrus
and
yeast
linger
into
the
aftertaste
light
and
refreshing
to
a
high
degree
but
still
medium
in
body
and
fullflavored
its
easy
to
see
why
this
is
one
of
capitals
key
brews
d
this
is
a
pretty
standard
wheat
ale
it
tastes
good
and
is
very
easy
drinking
notes
from
73106
this
was
an
unremarkable
but
refreshing
beer
d
this
was
a
relatively
weak
flavored
wheat
ale
but
that
is
by
definition
deadon
for
the
style
thus
its
pretty
darn
drinkable
mouthgeel
is
average
carbonation
is
adequate
finish
is
thin
d
easy
to
session
just
not
very
interesting
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
goes
down
easily
and
flavorfully
great
with
food
like
my
salad
nicely
done
seems
best
when
cold
pours
a
very
light
yellow
almost
clear
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
very
light
lacing
lots
of
wheat
aroma
with
some
sour
yeast
wheat
also
dominates
the
taste
with
some
sweet
malt
and
lemon
mixed
in
light
body
high
carbonation
cleanses
the
mouth
goes
down
real
easy
but
not
much
to
it
d
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
of
them
but
would
probably
get
bored
drinking
it
unless
drinking
for
quantity
it
was
pretty
good
to
drink
i
found
it
refreshing
and
easy
going
the
sum
of
all
of
its
qualities
makes
this
very
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
the
head
is
birhgt
white
billowy
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
mild
tangy
wheat
and
really
nothing
else
the
taste
is
as
unadventurous
as
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
carbonation
which
is
annoyingly
high
even
for
a
wheat
beer
overall
this
is
a
boring
beer
i
cannot
think
of
any
reason
why
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
pours
a
slightly
hazed
golden
pale
with
a
modest
white
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
sweet
yeasty
wheat
lemon
and
some
spice
the
flavor
is
light
honey
wheat
light
and
light
spice
creamy
texture
very
soft
mouthfeel
a
decent
summer
beer
but
capital
definitely
makes
better
this
wheat
ale
pours
a
clear
light
golden
body
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
there
is
a
strong
dry
wheat
aroma
from
the
local
wheat
your
first
taste
is
a
big
toasty
wheat
nose
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
support
the
dry
after
taste
there
is
no
loss
in
the
zip
department
with
a
some
pepper
and
lemon
zest
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
and
the
flavor
profile
does
a
good
job
of
highlighting
the
locally
grown
wheat
the
other
flavors
support
and
balance
out
the
wheat
light
refreshing
bit
of
terior
but
with
wheat
instead
of
hops
try
with
a
lawn
chair
at
the
end
of
a
hot
day
or
a
basic
freshly
grilled
fish
taco
goes
great
with
anything
drinkability
is
off
the
freaking
chart
has
a
clearly
identifiable
wheat
taste
that
lingers
somewhat
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
md
highly
carbonated
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
have
had
much
better
wheats
crisp
and
not
quite
as
thin
as
the
aforementioned
descriptors
would
perhaps
lead
you
to
believe
still
this
is
one
of
the
least
interesting
beers
ive
had
out
of
middleton
best
they
stick
to
making
firstrate
bocks
and
lagers
and
leave
wheat
beers
to
their
brethren
in
new
glarus
it
might
be
better
with
a
slice
of
orange
in
it
or
something
but
by
itself
it
isnt
worth
the
price
compared
to
other
wheat
beers
drinkable
yes
yet
too
uninspiring
to
prove
sessionable
drinkability
if
you
are
looking
for
a
light
wheat
beer
this
will
be
for
you
however
i
like
more
flavors
in
my
wheat
beers
lets
out
a
thin
head
but
a
strong
ring
o
foam
around
the
perimeter
of
the
beer
very
pale
banana
golden
hay
and
mild
bubbling
very
small
bubbles
the
aroma
is
a
little
tart
bananas
very
faint
smell
more
dry
malts
than
anything
the
taste
is
a
little
bland
and
tart
almost
sour
ester
malts
with
no
noticeable
hops
pretty
clean
palate
a
little
adjuncty
tasting
bitterness
that
brings
the
mouthfeel
down
a
peg
but
very
easy
to
drink
ive
had
this
beer
a
couple
times
in
the
past
and
i
never
truly
enjoyed
it
not
to
say
its
a
bad
beer
in
any
way
because
all
beers
have
their
place
this
is
just
one
i
dont
much
enjoy
smell
has
a
slight
citrus
tinge
to
it
taste
has
a
pale
lemon
flavor
to
it
hops
and
malt
blend
weak
in
the
background
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
light
tasting
beer
this
is
pretty
good
its
straightforward
but
it
tastes
good
despite
the
fairly
light
and
smooth
taste
it
does
not
give
me
the
impression
of
being
watery
theres
nothing
too
remarkable
about
it
but
pretty
drinkable
12
oz
bottle
the
brew
is
very
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
sparse
coat
over
top
of
the
brew
there
is
a
steady
carbonation
and
the
clarity
is
excellent
on
this
one
looking
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
i
should
have
swirled
this
one
during
the
pour
as
there
is
a
lot
of
yeast
in
there
the
aroma
is
husky
and
wheaty
with
strong
fruity
overtones
taking
a
sip
i
get
a
light
wheat
light
herbal
hop
with
a
tailing
bitterness
hat
clings
to
the
side
of
my
tongue
it
is
extremely
clean
without
a
lot
to
it
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
moderate
to
strong
carbonation
that
stings
a
little
on
my
tongue
im
torn
with
this
brew
because
it
has
been
such
a
nice
one
to
take
camping
for
sitting
around
the
fire
and
for
enjoying
in
the
heat
of
the
day
it
is
one
that
i
can
really
sit
down
and
just
enjoy
without
having
to
do
a
lot
of
thinking
so
i
think
it
carries
through
on
what
it
is
meant
to
be
i
enjoy
it
a
real
session
beer
i
prefer
the
kloster
weizen
but
nothing
wrong
here
drinkability
is
great
clean
flavors
and
a
light
character
make
this
one
very
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
not
bad
but
it
is
not
good
either
and
certainly
not
inspiring
and
so
its
sessionability
for
me
is
quite
low
d
good
d
a
smooth
drink
which
tastes
pretty
good
and
1
can
easily
follow
the
other
d
i
think
this
is
a
great
session
beer
i
have
had
it
in
cans
while
on
a
river
trip
its
good
stuff
a
very
unremarkable
beer
will
not
have
this
one
again
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
yellow
gold
a
constant
bubbling
springs
forth
from
below
a
white
cap
settling
down
to
film
that
looks
remarkably
like
downtown
madison
and
its
two
lakes
the
aroma
is
pale
wheaty
malt
thats
about
it
pleasant
though
the
taste
is
marginally
better
some
berries
thrown
in
with
the
wheat
the
body
is
pretty
decent
the
carbonation
too
low
for
the
style
overall
kind
of
a
wierd
american
wheat
but
not
too
shabby
this
beer
ranks
about
5
on
my
top
10
almost
everyone
i
know
that
has
tried
it
has
liked
it
even
though
most
are
caught
up
in
the
budlite
crapshoot
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
particularly
in
the
summer
light
and
refreshing
and
local
well
made
beer
from
a
high
quality
producer
straight
out
of
the
fridge
poured
form
the
bottle
into
my
favorite
glass
poured
surprisingly
clear
for
a
wheat
so
i
looked
in
the
bottle
and
all
the
sediment
was
stuck
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
medium
yellow
in
color
with
thin
white
head
very
little
head
retention
slight
malty
aroma
but
i
didnt
really
detect
anything
else
mediumlight
body
well
balanced
slight
taste
of
hops
and
malt
with
a
slight
citrus
taste
on
the
finish
i
wonder
if
there
may
have
been
a
more
yeasty
taste
if
id
agitated
at
the
finish
of
the
pour
to
get
the
sediment
into
the
beer
very
drinkable
beer
alcohol
not
very
detectable
very
well
done
an
excellent
american
wheat
that
has
at
least
some
roots
in
the
bavarian
style
although
i
love
touring
the
brewery
and
everyone
there
is
really
nice
ive
just
never
been
a
big
fan
of
their
beers
theyve
always
seemed
just
a
bit
similar
to
me
obviously
theres
no
way
you
can
confuse
this
flavor
due
to
its
style
i
also
think
theyre
being
very
bold
with
how
sweet
this
is
this
beer
is
also
the
only
beer
that
sports
a
different
styled
logo
they
know
that
this
beer
is
different
and
are
treating
it
so
although
its
too
sweet
for
my
liking
any
wheat
beer
lover
has
got
to
try
this
very
hazy
amber
color
with
a
medium
white
head
decent
lacing
smell
is
weak
with
only
notes
of
pale
malt
and
wheat
maybe
a
touch
of
bread
taste
is
also
a
touch
weak
but
most
beers
in
this
style
cant
really
be
too
flavorful
a
touch
of
wheat
and
some
citrus
lemon
qualities
to
clean
the
palate
in
the
finish
theres
no
off
flavors
or
flaws
in
here
which
is
most
important
when
drinking
a
summer
quencher
like
an
american
wheat
capital
always
shines
in
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
and
this
is
no
different
smooth
long
flavors
quite
refreshing
good
for
the
summertime
as
a
quencher
but
the
style
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
as
a
whole
i
am
disappointed
that
i
laid
out
7
79
for
this
6pack
drinkability
great
summer
drinking
the
light
flavor
is
what
i
tend
to
call
macromicro
flavor
but
after
30
hours
of
driving
in
the
last
four
days
this
was
totally
what
i
was
looking
for
a
beer
that
cleanses
the
palate
and
invigorates
obviously
not
a
beer
for
hopheads
or
big
beer
fans
and
not
a
beer
that
will
stun
with
its
flavor
but
definitely
a
nice
offering
within
the
style
but
drinking
a
few
while
grilling
or
having
a
summer
meal
should
prove
satisfying
bottom
line
well
made
but
a
bit
boring
i
had
put
off
purchasing
this
because
i
feared
it
would
be
nearly
identical
to
goose
islands
urban
312
from
last
year
for
me
that
wasnt
too
far
from
the
truth
but
for
some
reason
i
happen
to
like
island
wheat
a
tad
better
like
others
have
said
though
and
the
same
thing
i
wrote
about
in
my
review
of
the
312
last
year
this
is
probably
created
to
appeal
to
the
spotted
cow
and
cattail
ale
group
a
beer
designed
to
cater
to
the
masses
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
for
my
wife
to
accompany
my
sixer
of
bitter
woman
no
puns
are
intended
tyraneas
bitter
woman
ipa
is
a
delicious
beer
and
my
wife
is
a
sexy
bitch
while
we
were
on
our
camping
trip
in
gov
dodge
state
park
i
smell
wheat
nothing
else
taste
is
wheaty
with
a
little
bit
of
yeast
thin
and
kind
of
blah
overall
ok
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
overall
not
particularly
satisfying
my
main
concern
is
that
since
this
beer
is
so
runofthemill
i
wonder
if
its
worth
capitals
while
to
go
out
of
their
way
to
get
wheat
from
washington
island
theres
lots
of
wheat
growing
right
around
madison
fellas
i
prefer
capitals
kloster
weizen
hefe
weizen
to
their
new
island
wheat
american
pale
wheat
simply
because
i
prefer
the
former
style
to
the
latter
however
theyre
both
good
versions
of
their
respective
styles
and
im
sure
that
both
have
or
soon
will
have
their
loyal
fans
drink
up
for
summer
is
upon
us
clouded
dull
yellow
lots
of
carbonation
is
present
frothy
white
head
sits
on
top
for
a
while
lace
is
good
the
aroma
seems
a
little
smoky
a
little
phenolic
and
a
little
tart
dumbed
down
flavors
for
a
dumbed
down
beer
for
the
dumbed
down
masses
but
will
the
masses
actually
drink
a
clouded
beer
like
this
dont
think
so
so
this
beer
serves
little
purpose
doesnt
appeal
to
the
dumbed
down
masses
doesnt
appeal
to
the
knowledgeable
beer
fan
stick
to
the
kloster
weizen
that
one
has
some
flavor
this
is
slightly
tart
and
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
blandness
across
the
board
a
little
acidity
carbonation
is
frisky
not
much
substance
here
im
disappointed
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
from
capital
brewery
beer
resembles
a
hefe
weiss
in
appearance
and
aroma
but
does
not
have
the
spiciness
of
that
particular
style
of
beer
nonetheless
this
beer
is
a
great
session
beer
and
one
that
i
will
enjoy
in
the
upcoming
summer
months
taste
was
a
refereshing
lighter
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
light
white
breadangel
food
type
cake
give
this
beer
a
try
12
ounce
bottle
island
wheat
pours
out
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
strong
wheat
aroma
with
some
citrus
the
tangy
wheat
flavor
is
light
and
totally
inoffensive
the
wheat
flavor
dominates
just
a
bit
lemony
i
taste
no
hops
finish
is
watery
no
sign
at
all
of
alcohol
a
poundable
beer
indeed
this
is
a
decent
enough
brew
if
not
this
beer
drinkers
cup
of
tea
its
certainly
worth
trying
once
so
my
buddy
has
a
kegerator
and
its
always
good
to
keep
everyone
happy
im
just
glad
he
didnt
opt
for
miller
lite
or
blue
moon
american
pale
wheats
are
a
tad
boring
in
my
opinion
but
this
serves
as
a
nice
session
it
was
far
better
out
of
the
keg
than
when
i
had
it
on
draft
at
state
street
brats
pours
a
pale
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
small
tan
head
smell
is
funky
sour
at
first
a
little
offputting
taste
has
that
same
sour
bite
but
quickly
transitions
into
an
unispiring
grassy
wheat
which
mysteriously
fades
to
water
kind
of
like
budweiser
select
i
guess
this
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
i
was
able
to
put
a
few
back
but
doesnt
really
show
any
character
either
seems
like
capital
is
trying
to
put
out
a
macro
here
they
make
it
seem
crafty
and
unique
in
its
gimmick
its
made
from
wheat
exclusively
grown
on
washington
island
right
off
door
county
but
this
is
probably
the
most
boring
beer
ive
had
from
capital
itll
be
a
big
hit
among
the
bar
crowd
and
macro
drinkers
who
think
theyre
drinking
fancy
beer
now
for
sure
klosterweizen
accomplishes
all
this
already
and
so
much
more
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
definitely
another
solid
brew
from
capital
that
i
will
drink
again
and
again

to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
clean
and
refreshing
this
brew
is
a
nice
summer
wheat
beer
i
like
how
hop
sun
summer
wheat
beer
is
different
from
most
wheat
brews
on
the
market
one
thing
that
stands
out
with
hop
sun
is
this
brew
is
filtered
overall
im
giving
hop
sun
summer
wheat
beer
a
4
5
out
of
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
is
full
of
citrus
and
floral
notes
to
make
a
very
bright
scented
beer
the
taste
was
equally
bright
with
hop
notes
coming
first
and
then
a
bright
wheat
flavor
that
left
hints
of
banana
and
clove
to
the
beer
very
refreshing

at
shortys
9th
ave
nyc
had
1
on
tap
not
as
refreshing
as
they
like
to
think
this
brew
is
pleasant
but
not
a
long
distance
summer
quaffer
i
like
it
but
will
keep
looking
for
that
perfect
whatever
extraordinarily
balanced
a
beer
that
actually
makes
me
want
more
would
be
amazing
to
drink
on
a
hot
summers
day
o
simply
profiled
yet
well
balanced
and
drinkable
a
worthy
option
for
those
hp
summer
days
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
moderate
head
it
smells
of
lemony
hops
and
tastes
like
lemony
hops
and
wheat
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
refreshing
while
at
the
same
time
not
sacrificing
on
flavor
poured
into
a
pint
very
golden
in
appearance
smell
is
citruslemon
and
wheat
nice
taste
a
lot
of
the
reviews
call
this
crisp
and
a
nice
summer
beer
and
i
would
agree
with
that
although
there
is
nothing
outstanding
about
it
i
will
pick
it
up
again
sometime
on
a
hot
day
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
others
as
you
can
see
this
is
a
very
clear
beer
had
me
worried
initially
at
first
sip
i
was
thinking
more
like
a
helles
or
pils
may
have
had
sumpin
on
the
brain
though
it
started
to
show
a
little
bit
of
crisp
bite
but
not
much
get
a
real
nice
mash
aroma
especially
for
just
being
in
a
pint
glass
i
find
it
really
similar
to
a
thinner
lighter
boston
lager
not
sure
how
they
got
so
much
malt
flavor
in
such
a
light
colored
bodied
beer
if
you
love
the
smell
of
the
rolling
boil
give
this
one
a
try
at
5
1
and
106
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
summer
brew
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
easy
drinking
and
perfect
for
the
summer
heat
the
best
word
i
can
use
to
describe
hop
sun
is
crisp
it
has
that
light
front
of
the
tongue
floral
hop
that
breaks
off
really
fast
and
as
that
refreshing
almost
pilsner
aftertaste
a
simple
and
complicated
beer
rolled
into
one
overall
a
great
wheat
beer
and
probably
the
best
summer
beer
ive
had
poured
a
light
clear
gold
with
a
creamier
white
head
head
has
moderate
retention
but
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
mild
almost
nonexistent
with
some
very
light
hints
of
undefined
hops
the
taste
is
equally
mild
it
just
has
a
little
more
flavor
than
the
aroma
indicated
there
isnt
really
anything
distinctive
especially
from
a
wheat
beer
its
a
little
thinner
in
weight
and
feel
i
like
the
effort
to
make
a
flavorful
summer
beer
thats
lower
abv
but
this
one
doesnt
have
the
flavor
to
pull
it
off
from
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
where
it
belongs
nice
2
finger

translucent
pale
straw
with
a
foamy
white
head
smells
of

nice
stuff
poured
from
a
355ml

a
deep

yellow
this
is
definitely
a
heavily
filtered
wheat
beer
nose
is
all
about
hops
pine
pineapple
with
a
hint
of
tart
apple
taste
is
similar
with

hit
of
spicy

great

low
c
m
o
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
its
a
good
summer
session
beer
it
has
a
super
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
good
flavor
although
it
leaves
me
hungry
for
a
bigger
more
complex
beer
overall
this
beer
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
diet
ipa
o
a
summer
favorite
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
this
until
now
this
is
an
absolute
goto
during
hot
weather
for
me
while
there
may
be
others
that
do
this
style
better
i
find
the
refreshing
qualities
of
this
beer
along
with
a
solid
flavor
to
be
what
makes
it
stand
out
hop
sun
is
a
fine
summer
drinking
beer
suitable
from
late
spring
but
more
full
than
a
typical
lawnmower
beer
off
notes
however
do
hold
it
back
not
ready
for
summer
to
go
away
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
persists
forever
smells
of
lemon
cracked
grain
light
sugar
and
earthy
and
citrus
hops
the
flavor
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
spicy
wheat
grain
against
a
light
sweet
sugary
malt
offset
with
some
light
lemony
citrus
hop
light
to
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
nice
flavorful
light
easy
drinking
lawnmower
beer
i
guess
its
a
hoppy
wheat
beer
as
advertised
its
just
lacking
a
bit
comes
off
like
a
thin
pale
ale
i
like
the
aroma
and
its
not
bad
but
the
combo
just
doesnt
work
for
me
and
i
wouldnt
likely
seek
it
out
would
much
rather
one
of
souther
tiers
other
fine
offerings
its
a
refreshing
brew
however
the
taste
is
very
much
pilsnerish
with
a
tiny
bit
of
honey
lemon
and
biscuits
plopped
into
it
the
finish
is
also
quite
dry
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
o
this
beer
reminds
me
very
much
of
312
urban
wheat
which
i
guess
they
are
similar
lighter
wheat
beers
just
didnt
much
flavor
at
all
from
this
one
great
summer
session
beer
drink
it
on
a
bot
after
mowing
the
lawn
after
a
great
mountain
bike
ride
nothing
spectacular
but
really
drinkable
rjt
overall
a
rather
easy
drinking
and
not
too
sweet
wheat
brew
a
decent
grainy
and
grassy
american
wheat
o
the
dry
crisp
beer
has
some
nice
flavors
but
there
very
soft
and
get
buried
under
the
fizz
a
bit
overall
another
very
good
summer
beer
for
the
go
to
list
overall
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
apwa
it
manages
to
bring
in
a
very
hop
forward
profile
like
a
couple
of
other
hoppy
wheats
i
could
name
but
does
so
with
great
balance
and
subtlety
a
perfect
summertime
beer
odecent
summer
beer
easy
drinking
o
the
aromas
take
a
while
to
show
up
here
otherwise
a
fine
summer
brew
o
absurdly
drinkable
im
reviewing
the
last
of
three
that
i
have
received
as
gifts
this
summer
and
i
am
sad
to
see
them
go
ive
been
enjoying
the
wheat
beers
that
have
come
out
this
summer
both
the
traditional
german
style
as
well
as
the
versions
that
showcase
the
more
citrusy
hops
this
is
a
solid
addition
to
the
ommegang
and
boulevard
offerings

fell
lazy

a
touch

smells
like
it
too
the
lemon
really
comes
forward
sweetly
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
light
crisp
and
clean
fruity
lemon
grass
refreshing
wheat
a
little
tangy
has
a
fine
bitter
that
doesnt
overwhelm
but
plays
with
the
sour
aspect
of
the
wheat
and
finishes
with
a
little
cracker
and
not
so
much
honey
the
body
is
smooth
and
it
drinks
refreshing
you
dont
even
notice
the
carbonation
it
goes
down
so
easy
really
excellent
taste
starts
with
bready
light
malts
then
wheat
and
has
a
wheaty
citrus
zest
finish
has
a
bready
and
slight
zesty
aftertaste
body
is
very
light
with
extremely
high
carbonation
this
is
definitley
not
your
standard
wheat
beer
but
i
found
it
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
summer
beer
12

alcohol
is

overall
this
is
a
very
nice
pale
wheat
ale
nice
balance
of
hop
and
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
i
am
not
much
of
a
wheat
beer
fan
i
only
sample
them
to
work
on
my
karma
but
this
was
truely
different
much
more
likeable
flavor
not
as
harsh
as
your
typical
wheat
can
say
i
would
buy
this
again
cheers
o
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
this
a
wheaty
apa
whereas
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hoppy
wheat
bear
regardless
its
pretty
decent
poured
this
one
into
a
glass
and
it
has
a
yellow
color
body
with
a
small
head
the
smell
has
a
citrus
hop
aroma
with
a
quick
malt
hint
in
there
also
the
taste
is
refreshing
of
citrus
and
hops
and
some
wheat
not
much
else
going
on
the
mouth
feel
is
very
smooth
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
really
good
easy
drinking
beer
and
is
refreshing
also
d
very
herbal
a
little
too
tealike
onenote
for
me
not
sure
if
this
is
a
past
its
prime
issue
as
the
bornon
date
was
a
bit
blurred
not
my
ideal
summer
brew
but
not
a
bad
beer
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
clear
golden
with
a
thin
white
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
beer
smells
of
lemon
and
pine
but
not
in
an
overpowering
manner
i
get
some
of
the
pale
malt
and
the
wheat
in
the
smell
as
well
which
brings
a
nice
light
breadiness
the
flavor
is
pretty
hop
forward
for
the
typical
american
wheat
beer
but
like
in
the
aroma
the
citrus
and
pine
dont
overpower
theres
some
nice
back
end
piney
bitterness
i
also
get
some
of
the
lightly
bready
malt
which
provides
some
nice
backbone
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
high
carbonation
the
beer
is
highly
drinkable
and
goes
down
smoothly
this
is
an
excellent
beer
a
really
refreshing
wheat
beer
that
tastes
like
everyones
favorite
breakfast
cereal
overall
its
a
tasty
summertime
brew
perfect
for
the
warm
weather
not
a
bad
intro
for
those
moving
from
wheat
beers
to
pale
ales
o
not
what
the
doctor
ordered
its
not
your
typical
wheat
beer
here
its
not
a
drain
pour
by
any
stretch
by
contrast
not
a
bad
summer
beer
close
to
a
pilsner
though
poured
from
tap
at
tap
and
mallet
rochester
pours
a
golden
clear
color
with
no
head
mellow
hop
and
pine
aromas
some
lemon
taste
is
wheaty
mellow
hops
with
a
big
lemon
finish
its
somewhat
bitter
but
still
pleasant
its
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
summer
brew
o
this
ones
okay
maybe
id
like
it
better
on
a
warmer
afternoon
summer
brews
in
april
whats
next
oktoberfest
brews
in
august
wait
dont
answer
that
all
in
all
im
a
bit
let
down
considering
how
much
i
enjoy
a
great
hoppy
wheat
ale
having
said
that
its
worth
trying
if
not
seeking
out
o
southern
tier
captures
the
easydrinking
bliss
and
flavorful
hoppy
compounds
together
very
nicely
in
hop
sun
a
refreshing
tasty
hot
day
treat
this
is
a
nice
light
summer
beer
but
it
didnt
have
any
wow
factor
to
it
o
a
really
nice
beer
i
havent
cared
much
for
st
in
the
past
but
this
one
hits
the
spot
even
a
few
months
after
its
peak
o
overall
its
meh
id
probably
never
purchase
this
again
but
its
better
than
your
standard
bud
miller
coors
overall
very
light
and
crisp
definitely
reminds
me
of
a
pilsner
i
might
have
another
given
the
chance
overall
a
decent
showing
for
a
wheat
beer
but
i
have
had
some
that
i
like
more
a
little
better
than
average
overall
this
is
a
solid
summer
sessionable
hoppy
wheat
beer
nothing
too
revolutionary
and
i
think
the
wheat
and
pale
malt
sweetness
are
a
bit
distracting
they
take
away
from
being
able
to
identify
the
hop
aromas
and
flavors
and
while
i
normally
enjoy
a
nice
balance
in
my
beers
session
beers
needs
to
stand
out
in
one
way
or
another
of
just
come
across
borning
and
weak
bodied
overall
an
excellent
wheat
ale
so
drinkable
and
refreshing
recommended
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
scent
is
very
sweet
with
wheat
and
citrus
tones
with
some
hints
of
hops
has
a
smooth
mellow
taste
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
that
turns
into
a
dry
organic
wheat
after
taste
starts
off
refreshing
but
then
goes
into
this
bad
pale
ale
type
taste
interesting
but
not
something
i
look
for
in
a
wheat
beer
personally
o
overall
a
nice
wheat
beer
ton
of
citrus
in
the
taste
which
is
awesome
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
easy
drinking
summer
beer
overall
goes
down
easy
a
bit
light
on
the
wheat
too
heavy
on
the
hops
more
bitter
than
sweet
mouthfeel
this
is
a
mediumlight
bodied
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
and
smooth
on
the
palate
hop
sun
is
another
great
hot
summer
day
beer
that
goes
down
as
easy
as
any
bmc
o
great
summer
beer
light
body
and
easy
drinking
has
some
nice
wheat
and
hop
character
o
truth
be
told
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
i
was
told
this
was
a
very
good
example
of
it
and
it
does
have
some
more
hop
flavor
than
others
ive
had
of
this
style
it
is
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
but
definitely
not
all
that
interesting
of
a
beer
overall
great
summer
wheat
beer
with
wellthought
balances
of
flavors
growler
from
gbx
poured
into
a
pint
glass
nice
clear
golden
pour
with
a
generous
2
finger
head
smell
was
hop
forward
with
the
piney
floural
hit
that
settles
into
some
of
the
bready
malts
and
cloves
a
bit
strong
on
the
hop
smell
was
distracting
taste
was
also
hop
forward
with
te
pine
hitting
initially
followed
by
floral
and
malts
a
good
hit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
some
of
the
cloves
and
fruit
are
felt
in
the
middle
pretty
well
balanced
after
the
hop
hit
i
prefer
more
bread
malts
on
my
wheats
but
this
was
interesting
st
usually
goes
over
the
top
with
their
styles
and
this
is
definately
different
feel
was
okay
with
some
hop
dryness
and
quite
a
bit
of
carb
overall
an
intersting
take
on
the
style
a
bit
too
hop
forward
for
me
but
worth
the
try
pretty
complex
for
a
summer
brew
wouldnt
turn
one
down
the
was
crisp
and
smooth
drinkability
was
good
the
beer
went
down
quick
and
easy
overall
a
decent
beer
for
a
summer
refresher
there
are
better
and
much
worse
options
available
probably
worth
a
shot
o
a
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
summer
beer
went
down
quite
easily
on
a
warm
summer
evening
at
the
local
pub
with
the
windows
open
and
fresh
air
easily
sessionable
and
one
i
would
likely
get
another
time
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
light
orange
straw
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
and
lacy
film
light
aroma
of
wheat
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
lemon
flavor
follows
aroma
with
wheat
malt
light
bittering
hops
and
a
hint
of
citrus
finishes
with
a
light
but
distinct
wheat
flavor
with
the
residual
sweetness
faintly
of
graham
cracker
a
nice
subtly
flavored
light
wheat
ale
the
flavor
components
were
nice
and
well
balanced
but
i
wish
they
were
a
little
more
assertive
light
bodied
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
still
a
good
summer
sipping
beer
which
is
what
it
offers
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
ought
to
be
a
staple
of
easy
drinking
in
the
summertime
its
pleasant
flavor
guides
things
along
well
overall
it
looks
like
a
macro
doesnt
taste
like
one
but
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
decent
apwa
either
pass
on
this
one
overall
it
wasnt
terrible
but
i
would
only
drink
this
beer
if
there
was
nothing
better
in
my
fridge
hayward
abbey
rating
85
overall
a
very
tasty
summer
seasonal
crisp
clean
and
very
refreshing
im
not
always
a
southern
tier
fan
but
im
enjoying
hop
sun
very
much
this
is
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
ive
had
and
the
next
time
i
get
my
hands
on
some
fff
gumballhead
i
will
give
it
a
shot
at
the
title
it
drinks
as
if
the
brewers
decided
to
make
a
perfectly
balanced
wheat
beer
then
at
the
last
minute
tossed
in
some
extra
hops
if
i
had
to
criticize
it
i
would
say
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
carbonated
and
had
just
a
bit
more
sparkle
next
i
might
try
a
blend
of
hops
instead
of
just
one
other
than
that
i
wouldnt
change
much
it
is
always
nice
when
brewers
make
dull
styles
interesting
st
did
it
here
very
very
well
done
the
beer
pours
like
a
clear
filtered
american
lager
a
straw
yellow
color
with
10
seconds
of
a
loose
white
head
that
definitely
doesnt
lace
the
nose
is
sweet
and
slightly
floral
but
the
hops
are
all
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
initial
sweetness
from
the
malt
casts
a
light
lingering
bitterness
that
remains
floral
and
balanced
the
mouth
is
slightly
watery
and
its
definitely
a
drinkable
summer
ale
once
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
even
more
lagerlike
with
a
bigger
fruitier
backbone
from
the
maltwheat
and
almost
no
spice
dont
drink
this
beer
if
youre
looking
for
hops
despite
the
incredibly
subtle
aroma
southern
tiers
hop
sun
is
still
a
decent
american
pale
wheat
ale
i
could
see
this
being
a
nice
hot
weather
beer
originally
reviewed
05292011
o
a
solid
summer
offering
that
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
and
has
some
good
flavor
to
it
would
certainly
be
a
great
intro
beer
and
is
ideal
for
the
season
o
very
enjoyable
and
worth
seeking
out
o
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
maybe
i
am
just
drinking
it
in
the
wrong
setting
indoors
spring
might
try
once
more
in
summer
to
see
if
a
different
impression
pours
a
darker
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
inviting
a
nice
hop
aroma
with
some
hints
of
pine
the
taste
is
a
nice
duo
of
hop
and
malt
neither
overpower
the
other
but
you
get
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
with
each
the
beer
ends
with
the
hop
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
good
balance
in
flavor
and
good
carbonation
no
missteps
here
just
a
good
quality
beer
with
nice
flavors
a
nice
beer
worth
checking
out
a
great
summer
beer
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant

color
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
and
a
light
fluffy
offwhite
head
about
a
half
an

aromas
are
subtle
with
a
roasted
grain
and
slight
hop
blending
flavors
are
much
more
pronounced
with
a
heavy
toasted
backbone
giving
rise
to
a
light
citrus

floral
hops
profile
tangy
crisp
mouthfeel
at
the
end
of
the
brew
with
a
roasty
and
hoppy
aftertaste
very
interesting
dynamic
the
finish
is
astringent
and
slightly
sharp
with
a
slight
linger
good
tasty
brew
that
gives
a
different
vibe
to
a

o
overall
this

will
definitely
be
added
to

overall
the

the

of

however
overall
i
dont

id
had
a
summer
beer
that
tasty
since
ive
been
drinking
beer
i
like
how
it
was
a
light
beer
but
still
was
very
flavorful
even
if
youre
not
a

this
beer
will
be
good
the

the

is

mild
the

plays

overall

im
really
beginning

this

going
to
several
of
their
beers
as
regular
choices
beer
is
medium

pretty
sweet
light
on

light
on

basically
a

candied

thats
about
it
not
a

o
not
bad
but
the
low

hurts

o
it
was
actually
better
than
i
anticipated
it
had
a

of
flavor
for
the
style
it
was
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side

quite
good
clear

a
bit

clear
for
a
wheat
beer
in
my
opinion

with

no

nice
fruity
aroma
with
lemon
and
a
subtle
coconut
scent
coming
through

taste
is
grainy
yet
bittersweet
and
refreshing
nice
light
mouthfeel
and
a
good
finish
a
flavorful
beer
that
is
definitely
good
for
the
summer
im
sure
but
all
in
all
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
this
is
a
fresh
and
interesting
american
wheat
but
i
really
dont
like
this
much

the

was
great

i
loved
this
and
will
seek
it
out
next

o
my
favorite
summer
beer

very

beer
that
is

drinkable
but
i
dont
notice
anything
that
makes
me
like
it
more
than
just
a
average
beer
this
is
really
just
an
average
beer
a
very
nice
summer

very
drinkable
and
refreshing
in

with
but
a
tick

and
two
ticks
below

o
very
enjoyable
beer
anytime
i
can
understand
why
this
would
be
a
summer
beer
though
as
it
would
do
wonders
on
a
hot
day
12
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
5411
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
light
gold
color
with
about
a
half
inch
white
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
a
bit
light
overall
the
brew
smells
like
wheat
lemon
peel
and
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
grassy
hops
luckily
the
taste
is
much
stronger
than
the
aroma
is
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
its
a
decent
brew
but
next
time
ill
have
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
worth
a
try
for
me
this
is
a
meh
beer
its
not
bad
but
i
dont
like
it
all
that
much
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
of
wheat
ales
this
summer
and
this
is
not
in
the
upper
tier
of
those
ive
had
not
much
complexity
to
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
blah
and
its
just
not
all
that
refreshing
which
i
want
from
a
summer
wheat
this
is
the
3rd
beer
that
i
have
had
from
southern
tier
all
3
have
been
very
good
the
hop
sun
summer
seasonal
is
a
great
combo
of
hoppiness
and
smooth
drinkability
the
color
is
a
beautiful
golden
the
smell
is
sweet
citrus
and
hops
the
flavor
delivers
the
sweet
lemon
and
orange
blends
well
with
the
piney
hoppiness
the
only
regret
i
have
is
that
i
discovered
this
beer
so
late
in
the
summer
its
time
for
the
fall
beers
to
start
rollin
out
and
i
cant
wait
sampled
on
august

2011
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
with
short
lived
fizzy
white
head
that
diminishes
to
nothing
in
no
time
it
is
the
lemon
gras
that
takes
oiver
the
aroma
on
first
whiff
so
it
is
very
summerlike
in
that
regard
the
wheat
and
hops
are
more
subdued
the
light
body
doesnt
make
you
have
to
try
to
hard
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
taste
is
also
zinging
with
lemon
with
muted
malt
flavor
and
a
pungent
but
clean
hop
finish
a
nice
way
to
enjoy
the
dog
days
of
august
d
hm
maybe
the
hop
in
this
hop
sun
would
be
more
pronounced
fresher
overall
however
its
a
very
drinkable
wheat
beer
with
a
well
pronounced
wheat
taste
pours
a
shiny
clear
sunny
color
effervescent
head
is
fluffy
and
white
sticks
around
for
a
while
smell
is
of
toasted
wheat
some
citrus
notes
even
floral
as
well
taste
comes
across
in
the
form
of
a
very
balanced
wheat
and
citrus
combination
has
a
tang
to
it
crisp
and
refreshing
southern
tier
rarely
fails
to
disappoint
a
new
summer
favorite
overall
this
really
impressed
me
this
brew
does
a
great
job
upping
the
hop
flavors
while
still
maintaining
a
light
wheat
body
probably
the
best
summer
ale
ive
tasted
so
far
o
i
like
the
american
hop
presence
and
lack
of
a
big
presence
from
the
wheat
or
yeast
sort
of
a
poor
mans
gumballhead
o
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
overall
but
this
drank
very
well
on
a
hot
day
id
get
it
again
yeasty
and
husky
grains
aplenty
along
with
a
nice
snappy
lemon
presence
in
the
nose
along
with
the
lemony
bite
of
wheat
a
combo
of
earthyspicycitric
hop
notes
make
for
quite
a
flavorful
brew
some
lingering
sweetness
blunts
the
crispness
of
the
finish
but
its
overall
pretty
lively
and
goes
down
easy
nice
choice
for
escaping
the
heat
on
my
front
porch
this
its
a
pretty
flavorful
summer
wheat
beer
here
unlike
many
it
has
a
good
hop
presence
and
balance
very
refreshing
impressed
with
this
immediately
the
nose
got
me
far
more
hops
comes
through
in
the
nose
than
one
would
expect
on
the
palate
the
wheat
and
hops
blend
well
to
create
a
rather
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
probably
one
of
the
best
summer
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
greg
koch
be
danged
i
like
the
visual
of
fizzy
yellow
beers
and
i
do
not
care
what
he
or
others
think
of
me
this
got
me
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
color
was
sunshine
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
it
looked
like
summer
in
a
glass
i
would
actually
consider
putting
one
aside
for
a
dull
dreary
day
in
midfebruary
when
a
pickmeup
might
be
nice
nose
was
at
once
grassy
and
lemony
very
evocative
of
summer
mouthfeel
was
mediumtofull
with
a
very
grassy
taste
on
the
tongue
the
bottle
mentioned
1
variety
of
hops
and
3
types
of
malts
and
i
would
be
curious
to
know
what
they
were
this
was
very
tasty
very
refreshing
and
very
welcome
on
a
slow
summer
day
finish
was
semidry
and
quite
grassy
o
best
for
the
very
hot
days
with
outdoor
activities
baseball
grilling
the
lake
i
was
unimpressed
by
the
summer
offering
from
southern
tier
several
years
ago
when
i
first
tried
it
and
i
am
unimpressed
now
for
a
good
summer
offering
look
elsewhere
o
its
good
not
setting
the
world
on
fire
then
again
ive
grown
quite
fond
of
their
big
beers
the
hops
come
to
the
fore
in
a
lemony
kiss
of
hops
wanting
to
get
a
hop
fix
followed
by
a
nice
hop
sensation
to
dry
it
out
definitly
a
solid

pale

ale
for
a

seasonal
this
is
an
alright
beer
not
the
best
ive
had
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
high
astringency
the
flavor
is
of
grassy
hops
with
a
medium
bitterness
there
is
a
solid
malt
backbone
that
quickly
takes
over
with
less
wheat
character
than
i
expected
it
finishes
nice
and
dry
and
is
more
tolerant
to
warming
up
than
your
average
big
brewery
pilsner
i
know
that
american
wheats
can
be
more
aggressively
hopped
than
the
european
versions
sugar
as
the
spicy
hop
bitterness
was
backed
by
a
sweetness
tinged
with
juicy
fruit
gum
the
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
i
still
feel
that
its
not
cold
enough
to
be
out
of
season
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
puffy
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
and
down
the

aromatic

light

beer
i
liked
a
lot
of
the
parts
this
strikes
me
as
a
great
lawnmower
beer
or
a
great
beer
to
convert
a
bmc
drinker
to
craft
beer
not
super
exciting
but
nice

by

and
plenty
of

plenty
of

for
such
a
low

brew
i
believe
i
could
drink
this
by
the
case
were
it
available
locally
to
me
i
was
impressed
with
the

now

does
the

this

i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
think
of
it
as
really
a
wheat
beer
as
i
generally
think
of
wheat
beers
this
was
closer
to
an
apa
or
ipa
than
a
summer
wheat
too
hoppy
for
a
wheat
beer
again
very
straight

something
i
dont

from

the
store
i
got
this
advertised
it
as
a
wheat
ipa
so
i
had
to
give
something
like
that
a
try
even
here
it
is
listed
as
a
pale
wheat
ale
but
really
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
no
other
american
wheats
have
this
intense
of
a
hop
presence
besides
gumballhead
of
course
it
would
be
interesting
to
compare
this
side
by
side
with
gumball
to
see
how
they
size
up
to
eachother
the
actual
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
suprisingly
strong
flavored
which
is
not
the
typical
for
american
wheats
seek
this
one

was

were
abundant
with
hints
of
caramel
and
earth
very
nice
mouthfeel
was
refreshing
and
medium

a
good
level

drinkability
this
would
be
an
ideal
beer
for
after
a
long

afternoon

and
cutting

the

that
finishes
with
the
slight
hoppy
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
smooth
lightly
carbonated
it
was
good
really
good
and
because
of
the
lower
abv
it
makes
it
a
highly
drinkable
beer
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
on
any
hot

is

how
can
you
go
wrong
with
a
few
of
these
i
do
think
this
beer
very
much
holds
its
own
against
a
3
f
gumballhead
but
ny
is
a
lot
easier
for
me
than
indiana
almost
a
dirty
and
slightly
cloudy
golden
in
color
thin
white
head
fresh
citrus
fruit
and
sweet
hops
on
the
nose
crisp
and
oily
hops
noted
up

just
a
touch
of
wheat
bread
and
underlying
malts
fresh
bubble
gum
flavorings
unbelievably
sweet
decent
carbonation
bordering
on
medium
bodied
as
it
warms
and
its
tough
cause
this
is
so
smooth
and
slick
some
bread
dough
offerings
and
lemon
peel
notes
one
incredible
quencher
and
certainly
something
i
can
drink
at
any
time
superior
im
not
a
hop
chaser
personally
and
i
know
that
is
not
a
popular
sentiment
these
days
but
i
would
consider
this
a
great
choice
for
those
who
do
enjoy
such
beers
i
would
certainly
give
this
beer
another
go
flavorful
and
quite
interesting
for
the
style
a
hybrid
of
a
wheat
and
lightly
hopped
ipa
wonderfully
drinkable
for
the
summer
heat
with
more
flavor
than
your
typical
wheat
taste
really
reminded
me
of
an
alcoholic
cider
i
had
in
finland
a
few
times
very
very
similar
sour
citrus
pungent
and
hoppy
yet
sweet
in

bubbly
and
smooth

too

for

still
light

refreshing
and
a

fun
to

this

this

is

similar
to
other
souther
tier
beers
but
milder
this
is
milder
than
their
mild
ipa
but
still
great
hoppage
with
a
good
maltiness
to
balance
it
out
therefore
we
have
a
ncie
refreshing
beer
this
time
around
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
but
crisp
and
a
little
bitey
surprisingly
low
abv
with
this
beer
but
thats
allright
incredibly
drinkable
and
flavorful
this
beer
is
great
for
a
hot
day
and
still
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor

excellent

this

with

a
real

jumps
out

wich
is
unexpected
but
welcome
along
with
a
little
buttery
note
that
lingers
softly
alot
of
subtle
but
very
refined
nuances
to
this
beer
a
dry
wheaty
malt
backbone
holds
up
well
to
a
healthy
dose
of
citrusy
hop
i
mean
its
nearly
perfect
finishing
pretty
dry
and
buttery
compares
very
well
with
three
ffloyds
ghead
man
i
like
these
hoppy
american
wheat
ales
drinkability
is
excellent
refreshing
and
tasty
with
some
definitive
tastes
unlike
some
many
lighter
beers
that
just
losse
all
flavor
when
trying
to
brew
lighter
fare
another
soild
effort
from
the
folks
at
st
this
is
an
obvious
americanized
wheat
beer
as
its
meant
to
be
the
appearance
is
a
dark
gold
with
a
fine
white
head
the
aroma
is
hoppy
and
floral
with
a
comparable
hop
intensity
to
many
apas
the
flavor
is
very
crisp
from
the
wheat
with
the
citrusy
kick
of
the
hops
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
a
sort
of
blend
of
snpa
and
sn
wheat
but
really
its
own
creation
tongueland
typical
clean
st
taste
grassy
wheat
doughlike
sweet
fruit
sweet
malts
touch
of
hop
to
balance
and
dry

finish
a
perfect
summer
session
very
dimensional
a
combination
of
citrusy
hops
and
wheatbased
malt
greets
you
in
the
nose
of
this
delightful
summer
ale
its
deep
gold
body
is
slightly
hazy
beneath
an
averagesized
head
of
bright
white
froth
that
unfortunately
slips
easily
away
it
does
maintain
a
thin
surface
covering
however
and
leaves
sheets
of
tiny
spots
and
splashes
of
lace
that
cling
throughout
the
glass
its
crisp
and
slick
across
the
palate
with
a
lightmedium
body
and
very
finebubbled
carbonation
the
flavor
delivers
the
hops
that
the
nose
promises
along
with
a
solid
backbone
of
bitterness
that
leads
it
to
a
dry
and
citrusy
finish
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
worth
trying
yelloworange
pour
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
remains
for
most
of
the
time
it
took
to
drink
it
wow
i
wasnt
expecting
this
much
of
a
hop
aroma
very
strong
bitter
piney
hops
with
some
strong
orange
scents
in
there
as
well
extremely
juicy
hop
flavor
with
a
lot
of
pine
and
bitterness
thrown
in
there
as
well
the
hops
really
dominate
the
flavor
and
its
kind
of
hard
to
tell
this
one
is
a
wheat
beer
and
not
an
ipa
until
the
wheat
kind
of
slides
in
on
the
finish
and
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
i
really
really
like
this
ones
strong
hoppiness
on
the
wheat
backbone
probably
the
best
summer
brew
ive
had
this
early
in
the
young
season
well
done
prosit
i
feel
this
is
one
brew
that
is
just
what
it
says
it
is
and
thats
a
good
thing
no
surprises
pours
a
pale
light
yellow
color
with
an
average
unremarkable
head
the
nose
is
serious
citrus
and
hops
sweet
orange
and
apricot
the
taste
is
lightly
malty
with
a
big
wheatbeer
taste
full
of
lemon
and
grain
its
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
huge
satisfying
taste
by
the
midtaste
the
hops
start
to
kick
in
ending
with
an
aggressive
hop
finish
its
bitter
and
delicious
my
first
beer
from
southern
tier
the
only
other
beer
id
place
in
this
category
would
perhaps
be
im
so
glad
i
got
a
couple
bottles
of
each
of
their
varieties
at
half
time
three
floyds
gumballhead
india
wheat
ale
this
stuff
is
delicious
probably
immensely
so
in
the
summer
heat
ill
be
sure
to
try
again
next
year
hop
sun
is
my
first
southern
tier
beer
and
im
impressed
its
tough
to
make
a
summer
wheat
stand
out
but
this
beer
is
as
radiant
as
old
sol
on
a
july
afternoon
in
fact
id
love
to
have
a
few
cases
at
the
start
of
every
summer
thanks
to
happyhourhero
for
the
first
of
many
bottles
from
new
york
state
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
gold
especially
bright
for
a
beer
head
retention
could
use
some
work
though
still
lacy
i
didnt
smell
much
from
this
beer
taste
however
was
excellent
amazingly
refreshing
a
very
light
beer
citruslike
elements
are
dominant
here
but
very
little
confusion
with
the
sweet
malt
and
the
light
hop
profiles
pilsnerlike
in
the
sense
that
this
would
go
with
nearly
any
meal
a
great
beer
to
try
a
great
conversion
beer
and
an
excellent
beer
for
any
outdoor
activities
poured
in
an
imperial
pint
glass
forms
a
14
white
head
which
laces
acceptably
a
sunny
goldenamber
brew
with
a
nose
of
some
palts
malts
and
a
dominating
hops
scent
taste
seems
almost
two
faced
with
a
pleasant
pale
malt
flavor
in
one
place
and
hops
going
to
town
somewhere
else
they
work
well
together
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
excellent
wow
if
this
isnt
a
summer
weekender
im
ont
sure
what
would
be
drinkability
notes
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
summer
seasonals
i
have
had
to
date
pours
out
a
light
goldenamber
color
with
a
nice
head
that
sticks
around
until
the
very
end
smell
consisted
of
juiced
hops
along
with
some
citrus
aromas
and
some
slight
pine
notes
as
well
not
bad
so
far
taste
was
good
some
good
malt
undertones
in
this
beer
with
the
wheat
and
hops
riding
on
top
some
nice
citrus
and
pine
aftertaste
takes
place
but
doesnt
last
all
that
long
which
was
good
to
see
because
if
they
did
stick
around
it
could
of
become
a
little
overwhelming
but
this
is
a
good
pale
wheat
ale
perhaps
a
litlte
tough
to
find
but
if
you
do
see
it
grab
a
case
pours
a
deceivingly
clear
golden
pils
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
smells
gingery
and
hoppy
sans
ones
typical
wheat
ale
characteristics
very
hoppy
for
a
wheat
ale
bordering
ipa
territory
the
wheat
shows
up
in
the
background
of
the
malt
profile
very
enjoyable
and
atypical
for
a
wheat
ale
finished
fruity
sweet
blueberry
and
crisp
kudos
to
the
brewers
at
southern
tier
for
reinventing
the
wheel
in
a
summer
quaffer
usually
when
one
thinks
of
a
wheat
beer
hersbrucker
or
some
other
low
alpha
hop
plays
a
minor
role
in
the
finished
product
this
beer
is
not
that
beer
a
wheat
ale
for
hopheads
notes
huge
thanks
to
schoolteacher
for
suggesting
i
pick
some
up
while
visiting
the
empire
state
the
beer
is
so
pale
one
might
mistake
it
for
a
macro
lager
but
not
after
the
first
tasty
taste
given
the
summer
conditions
i
dont
think
you
can
go
wrong
buying
a
six
pack
or
case
of
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
the
best
of
both
worlds
it
has
a
light
wheatpale
malt
mix
with
a
wonderful
hoppy
aroma
that
enhances
the
beer
the
taste
is
great
as
well
it
has
a
light
wheat
malt
feel
with
a
floral
hop
flavor
that
refreshes
and
makes
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
awesome
summer
brew
it
has
great
aroma
and
taste
what
more
can
you
ask
for
this
is
a
good
drinker
a
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
summer
ale
hell
i
could
drink
this
anytime
especially
as
a
starter
beer
this
is
a
great
choice
for
introducing
newbys
to
craft
beer
imho
the
hop
aroma
is
green
and
somewhat
flowerydefinitely
dry
hopped
this
is
evident
in
the
taste
too
a
touch
of
sweetness
is
noted
in
the
flavor
although
i
could
not
detect
it
in
the
smell
a
friend
claimed
he
tasted
the
wheat
but
i
didnt
sense
it
the
beer
is
full
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
i
wish
this
were
available
around
boston
pours
a
clear
light

slight
thin
white

as
the
name
would

offset
with
a

lemon
tint
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
thin
very
thin
the
taste
is
a
disappointment
indistinct
a
little
piney
with
a
grainy
hint
but
the
hops
are
pretty
understated
an
easy
drinker
for
the
warm
months
and
certainly
a
step
up
from

but
not
really

had
this
brew
at
mahars
the
other
night
the
brew
poured
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
sized
pillow
white
head
that
had
retention
and
left
lacing
through
out
the
aromas
from
this
brew
where
all
about
the
hop
pine
and
grassy
notes
where
dominate
with
citrus
highlights
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
aroma
was
not
expecting
such
a
hop
hit
nice
smelling
brew
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
hoppyness
of
this
brew
but
your
able
to
notice
the
malt
and
sweet
flavors
from
the
wheat
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
for
the
hot
months
enjoy
this
after
working
up
a
sweat
working
on
the
lawn
etc
the
beer
is
a
bit
different
but
give
it
a
try
this
is

grainbill
pale

hopping
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
for
hot

refreshment
due
to
the
pineresin

nor
does
the
oddly
sour
wheat
leave
me
licking
my
lips
by
no
means
is
it
bad
its
just
a
little
too
experimental
southern
tier
has
been
an
excellent

upstart

i
hope
they
try
something
different

like
the
typical
american
wheat
ale
i
like
it
when
i
was
having
this
with
wvbeergeek
at
the
sharp
edge
i
called
this
a
wheat
pilsner
nice
pale
ale
with
just
the
smallest
of
after

recommend
and
would
drink
it
again
not
my
favorite

little

disappeared
color
was
a
pale
opaque
orangishyellow
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
hint
of
hops
and
the
slightest
touch
of
lemon
the
only
thing
that
i
liked
about
this
beer
is
the
fact
that
i
only
had
one
o
light
and
easy
drinking
but
nothing
i
would
want
again

simple
yet
effective
the
pour
was
a
pale
and
hazy
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
that
did
not
stick
around
for
very
long
the
smell
was
a
mixture
of
citrus
from
the
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
toasted
aroma
coming
through
the
taste
was
different
with
those
same
hop
notes
but
a
much
lighter
malt
characteristic
than
i
thought
based
on
the
smell
overall
enjoyable
and
refreshing
overall
a
simple
ale
with
subtle
flavors
but
very
drinkable
i
like
it
as
a
session
ale
nothing
too
special
about
this
beer
had
plenty
of
ones
like
this
before
sessionable
ale
for
the
summer
the
higher
mix
of
barley
malt
makes
it
less
tiresome
but
definitely
it
is
not
a
beer
to
take
you
off
the
ground
o
a
little
bit
on
the
bland
and
uninteresting
side
but
its
tough
to
make
an
american
wheat
ale
that
will
really
get
beer
geeks
going
it
does
its
job
though
its
an
inoffensive
quenching
wheat
ale
thats
simple
to
the
point
of
feeling
a
little
too
dumbed
down
it
would
hit
the
spot
nicely
as
a
lawnmower
beer
the
rest
amply
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
that
thins
on
the
finish
pretty
clean
and
light
on
the
pallet
without
being
boring
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
my
favorite
a
little
bit
too
light
for
a
pale
and
basically
no
hop
flavors
or
bitterness
which
was
disappointing
enjoyable
and
very
refreshing
and
light
on
the
palate
a
little
bit
skunky
but
not
overtly
so
good
as
a
craft
version
of
an
adjunct
piss
beer
the
taste
does
have
its
own
unique
character
as
advertised
which
downplays
the
wheat
and
brings
forth
the
pale
malts
and
bread
with
an
super
subtle
hop
finish
that
is
clean
and
crisp
ideal
for
today
which
was
90
degrees
taste
very
pleasant
not
like
most
wheat
beers
in
that
its
lacking
the
very
strong
clove
flavor
which
for
my
taste
is
fantastic
i
get
a
nice
wheat
flavor
a
little
creamy
and
it
melds
nicely
with
the
mild

overall
this
is
an
excellent
pale

ale
all
around
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
one
best
pale
wheat
ale
i
have
had
yet
overall
i
feel
like
it
may
lose
some
in
the
bottling
as
it
taste
a
bit
more
robust
on
tap
good
for
the
summer
time
or
after
breaking
a
sweat
overall
very
average
beer
for
me
even
within
the
pale
wheat
ale
style
its
bright
and
crisp
and
remarkably
drinkable
but
that
does
not
save
422
entirely
could
be
considered
sessionable
for
some
cheers
overall
coming
into
this
i
was
a
little
unimpressed
but
i
did
like
the
label
pale
wheat
ales
are
not
something
i
endeavor
into
too
often
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
some
things
were
missing
but
nothing
i
would
cry
about
light
body
met
with
a
zesty
and
clean
crisp
finish
after
taste
i
would
probably
not
have
again
but
would
definitely
recommend
to
a
friend
cheers
bottle
to
goblet
a
nice
example
of
the
style
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
some
of
its
higher
rated
counterparts
and
maybe
leaning
closer
to
the
yeast
highlights
of
its
german
counterparts

pale

not
unlike
a
typical
light
lager
plenty
of
white
foam
smells
like
a
typical
wheat
with
spiciness
but
also
a
bit
of
ammonia
taste
is
very
similar
dry
and
crisp
maybe
some
of
the
banana
you
would
expect
but
not
a
lot
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
not
really
sure
what
this
is
going
for
and
probably
wont
try
again
o
average
wheat
ale
looks
a
bit
nicer
and
smells
a
bit
better
than
it
tastes
this
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
only
a
slight
head
the
scent
is
of
cheap
grassy
grains
giving
it
an
overall
earthy
tone
the
taste
is
quite
light
yet
refreshing
with
citrus
and
wheat
combined
nicely
together
the
finish
is
very
clean
and
simple
this
is
a
good
starter
beer
for
those
looking
to
get
into
craft
beers
with
its
very
inviting
taste
a
refreshing
beer
nice
wheat
character
without
all
the
fruity
yeast
notes
of
a
hefe
the
nose
is
a
little
bland
but
the
wheat
malt
is
fresh
and
the
hop
profile
is
very
obviously
citrusy
lemons
and
limes
even
which
feel
like
a
summer
brew
more
than
anything
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
a
nice
fusion
of
hops
and
wheat
not
quite
a
wheat
ipa
as
the
hops
are
more
balanced
than
that
but
its
a
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
very
sessionable
with
its
light
body
and
bright
carbonation
i
am
surprised
its
scored
as
low
as
it
has
on
here
since
it
really
isnt
bad
at
all
i
think
in
the
spring
or
summer
itd
really
hit
the
spot
after
mowing
the
grass
or
something
a
front
porch
drinker
for
me
typical
american
wheats
are
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
i
would
expect
these
guys
to
do
something
more
along
the
lines
of
gumballhead
or
something
more
fruity
aroma
and
flavor
hops
would
do
wonders
for
this
beer
still
its
a
decent
summer
thirst
quencher
if
your
choices
are
limited
o
my
first
southern
tier
is
a
tad
lackluster
i
expected
a
terrific
beer
but
got
a
decent
offering
its
not
bad
its
just
less
than
expected
the
nose
was
more
powerful
and
started
off
great
once
warmed
the
nose
was
overly
boozy
the
taste
was
there
but
very
docile
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
though
very
easy
drinking
beer
only
if
you
like
it
though
pretty
average
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
a
lackluster
offering
nothing
bad
but
nothing
noteworthy
pretty
bland
rounded
out
mouthfeel
at
least
flavor
profile
is
much
like
the
nose
subtle
somewhat
buttery
whispy
some
sour
lemon
grass
extremely
clean
and
well
rounded
could
work
well
in
the
summer
as
the
flavor
gets
a
bit
bolder
with
each
sip
but
nothing
exciting
o
good
choice
when
you
want
a
wheat
beer
but
like
pale
or
ipa
styles

i

fan
of
the

esters
of
hefes
and
in
reading
the

description
i
became
slightly
nervous
if
anything
it
had
a
pleasant
malt
backbone
as
well
mouthfeel
was
on
the
full
side
being
full
of
carbonation
and
the
taste
had
a
tropical
fruitiness
like
pineapples
or
mangoes
maybe
even
guava
but
no
bananas
the
finish
was
semisweet
with
the
fruitiness
really
leading
the
way
and
then
lingering
i
liked
it
especially
on
a
hot
humid
summers
day
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
feel
the
same
way
on
22
april
great
for
summer
but
for
the
late
spring
overall
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
good
flavors
makes
for
a
tasty
session
o

still
a

m
on

heavier

of

with
a

level
of
standard

sort

comes
out

in

sticks
around
through

o
this

has
some
refreshing

and
goes
down
very
easily
making
this
rather
sessionable
o
ok
ive
had
better
have
had
worse
its
a
tasty
wheat
not
outstanding
or
one
of
sts
best
mind
you
but
quite
drinkable
o
very
average
beer
it
is
very
sessionable
and
would
be
refreshing
in
the
summer
probably
not
one
i
will
get
again
o
straightforward
and
really
easy
drinking
the
taste
is
good
and
clean
but
not
super
assertive
not
horrible
but
not
great
its
definitely
drinkable
though
overall
an
interesting
take
on
an
american
hefe
nothing
great
but
worth
a
try
probably
would
be
a
good
summer
ale
422
is
a
solid
though
unexciting
american
wheat
ale
it
might
be
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
in
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
it
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
slight
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
grass
hops
and
bread
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
wheat
beer
without
selling
short
on
the
hops
this
is
a
good
blend
of
wheat
and
hops
this
would
make
a
great
entrance
level
beer
for
someone
who
is
used
to
drinking
budweiser
or
some
other
watery
substance
odits
okay
decent
flavor
a
tad
boring
but
its
drinkable
just
a
slightly
below
average
beer
just
another
part
of
a
variety
pack
ok
not
must
have
o
nothing
too
crazy
but
a
good
super
crisp
and
drinkable
brew
that
was
fairly
enjoyable
interesting
take
on
the
style
taste
is
definitely
a
bit
oddball
kinda
like
a
withefeamerican
wheat
combo
with
hops
yeast
and
spice
all
detectable
to
some
degree
it
doesnt
all
seem
to
work
out
quite
right
though
not
very
soft
feel
to
it
and
the
spice
and
tropical
hop
notes
dont
blend
well
southern
tier
makes
some
great
beers
but
this
one
counts
as
a
miss
for
me
i
got
this
as
a
part
of
a
pack
of
pales
offered
by
southern
tier
this
was
not
my
favorite
but
it
wasnt
bad
nice
balance
between
styles
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
wheat
beer
its
got
a
good
bouquet
of
flavors
including
an
admirable
noble
hop
presence
good
for
the
style
pale
wheat
ales
arent
typically
the
most
exciting
styles
but
this
one
is
done
very
well
and
would
make
for
an
excellent
session
poured
into
a
pint
glass
really
clear
murky
yellow
smells
of
wheat
pale
ale
little
lager
little
macro
nice
crisp
orange
peel
and
a
lot
of
lemon
tastes
better
than
it
smells
but
catches
a
macro
vibe
pretty
watery
and
light
what
you
would
expect
from
a
wheat
pale
nice
beer
to
drink
a
bunch
of
and
a
better
alternative
to
a
macro
good
not
great
decent
o
i
thought
it
was
ok
a
decent
summer
beer
not
overwhelming
but
also
not
bad
overall
surprisingly
good
for
this
style
more
manly
than
expected
o
a
decent
brew
nothing
outstanding
everything
is
pretty
much
middle
of
the
road
very
nice
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
from
the
hops
it
has
a
decent
bite
from
the
yeast
with
good
carbonation
that
leaves
your
tongue
tingling
theres
a
good
fruity
flavor
on
the
end
as
well
for
a
style
that
generally
isnt
very
good
i
think
this
is
a
tasty
beer
overall
its
ok
i
didnt
like
the
carbonation
level
the
beer
doesnt
have
any
real
memorable
quality
it
doesnt
speak
to
southern
tiers
overall
quality
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
not
impressed
kind
of
bland
for
my
taste
o
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
many
better
beers
out
there
both
in
the
style
and
overall
if
i
went
to
a
friends
house
and
this
was
all
they
had
to
drink
however
i
wouldnt
think
twice
of
having
a
couple
just
not
something
id
ever
buy
alright
for
a
hot
day
but
fairly
bland
422
pale
wheat
ale
pours
a
hazy
straw
like
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
there
is
a
good
strong
full
smell
with
alot
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
the
wheat
comes
through
some
citrus
is
also
present
there
is
a
rather
sweet
taste
a
good
full
wheat
flavor
i
couldnt
taste
any
hops
however
good
full
flavor
could
use
just
a
bit
more
carbonation
in
my
opinion
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
excenlent
wheat
beer
i
was
expecting
a
hoppeir
flavor
but
still
an
overall
fantastic
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
pleasant
enough
with
some
light
citrus
and
floral
hops
coming
through
a
lot
of
wheat
malt
the
hops
are
bitter
for
a
second
and
then
are
taken
over
by
the
wheat
malt
the
hop
taste
lingers
for
a
little
but
again
the
wheat
is
the
winner
in
the
aftertaste
maybe
decent
for
the
style
but
really
theres
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
just
kind
of
bland
despite
the
hoppy
attempt
worth
the
try
though
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
disappearing
head
and
obvious
carbonation
the
nose
has
very
little
to
offer
slight
hint
of
straw
taste
is
light
mild
straw
and
wheat
but
bland
overall
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
a
nice
summer
drinker
reminds
me
a
little
of
oberon
has
floral
wheat
field

taste
has
a
bit
of
hard
candyhoney
drop
sweetness
and
some
lemony
citrus

nothing
complicated
here
but
a
nice
american
wheat
ale
with
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
doughy
wheaty
malt
up

light
peppery
spice

sweetness
moderate
body
with
a
prickly

dry
and
appetizing
a
nice

quencher
d
very
drinkable
nice
mix
of
flavors
and
very
refreshing
it
feels
light

crisp
without
sacrificing
flavor
and
mouthfeel
d
the
only
superlative
aspect
of
this
beer
is
balance
great
drinkability
perfect
for
a
session
or
a
bbq
super
approachable
in
a
beer
world
of
extremes
this
one
is
an
even
keel
a
real
relaxed
broad
reach
of
a
beer
o
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
but
they
need
to
get
the
carbonation
issue
fixed
i
lost
roughly
a
quarter
of
this
brew
as
it
erupting
out
of
the
bottle
overall
the
beer
definitely
has
an
interesting
taste
not
your
typical
wit
beer
for
sure
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
unbalanced
im
not
sure
id
want
more
than
1
or
2
of
these
in
a
sitting
stylistically
good
and
its
an
interesting
beer
good
things
done
i
think
with
what
theyve
got
jh
overall
would
have
to
say
this
is
a
weak
wheat
beer
imo
there
are
far
better
out
there
on
the
market
sorry
if
its
a
little
too
concise
im
still
working
on
developing
my
beer
vocabulary
wait
til
the
weather
gets
warmer
and
this
beer
feels
colder
and
then
ask
me
about
it
oa
good
summer
beer
possibly
a
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
as
well
sessionable
to
a
t
once
again
nothing
bad
but
nothing
spectacular
try
it
once
an
move
on
o
overall
its
a
nice
easy
beer
but
i
think
mine
wasnt
carbonated
enough
i
probably
just
got
a
bad
bottle
or
something
its
a
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
or
lawnmower
beer
disappointing
this
wheat
beer
wasnt
too
bad
it
poured
out
as
a
fairly
clear
looking
the
head
was
pretty
nice
standard
white
color
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
of
smooth
wheat
fields
with
some
hops
in
the
mix
the
flavor
here
is
of
wheat
and
grains
mixed
with
just
a
hint
of
hops
the
overall
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
that
its
easy
to
drink
its
a
good
summer
time
beer
its
pretty
refreshing
for
the
most
part
and
rather
light
too
overall
i
am
kind
of
stumped
a
very
good
brew
overall
better
than
the
ipa
but
i
find
the
pale
to
be
the
best
offering
this
case
has
to
offer
ipa
seems
to
be
lacking
in
hops
and
grains
make
this
beer
interesting
but
balance
put
fully
on
the
pale
good
beer
though
the
smell
and
look
of
this
beer
is
pretty
average
the
taste
however
is
a
really
good
balance
of
full
flavor
and
smoothness
the
only
other
beer
from
southern
tier
ive
had
was
their
imperial
mokah
which
is
also
a
really
great
tasting
beer
after
tasting
their
422
pale
wheat
i
will
be
sure
to
try
others
from
them
like
many
im
not
a
big
apwa
fan
but
not
surprisingly
southern
tier
makes
a
pretty
good
one
wellrounded
and
excellent
choice
for
a
warm
spring
day
o
its
a
pale
wheat
ale
and
a
very
good
one
at
that
you
should
know
what
to
expect
before
you
drink
it
so
dont
rate
it
poorly
because
you
perceive
it
to
be
plain
and
boring
when
in
actuality
its
light
crisp
and
easily
drinkable
and
intentionally
so
o
not
my
favorite
weiz
beer
drinkable
but
a
bit
dissapointing
for
souther
tier
o
not
good
flavor
is
light
as
is
the
mouthfeel
but
the
overall
beer
is
not
very
flavorful
and
the
flavor
that
it
does
have
is
not
very
enjoyable
look
elsewhere
for
a
light
summer
beer
drunkability
i
would
say
this
beer
is
fairly
average
however
i
like
this
beer
over
other
more
pungent
wheat
ales
because
it
lacks
that
heavy
coriander
flavor
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
defintely
isnt
one
to
be
sought
out
a
good
beer
for
its
style
not
hoppy
at
all
malt
dominated
smooth
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
a
touch
of
citrus
flavor
but
mostly
malts
not
complicated
but
not
bad
sunny
golden
in
body
with
white
head
that
fades
fast
a
sweet
inviting
aroma
of
lemon
juice
tropical
fruit
pears
and
wheat
tastes
of
light
tropical
fruit
pears
wheat
yellow
apples
slight
hop
bitterness
and
dryness
rides
out
the
finish
light
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
sweet
drink
that
is
more
wheat
than
pale
ale
with
light
fruit
as
the
focus
d
nicely
drinkable
great
hotday
beer
overall
pass
wish
i
hadnt
bought
a
whole
6er
not
bad
by
any
means
but
not
something
i
would
make
a
point
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
ahh
the
token
pale
wheat
in
the
mixed
case
i
really
wish
they
would
retire
this
practice
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
a
good
wheat
beer
from
time
to
time
but
most
of
the
time
they
arent
good
this
time
is
no
different
fom
the
orange
color
to
the
somewhat
bitter
palate
this
just
didnt
work
for
me
there
are
some
good
aspects
however
the
nose
is
pleasant
with
notes
of
lemon
and
spicy
yeast
and
some
of
this
carries
over
to
the
taste
allowing
a
moderate
level
of
drinkability
all
in
all
this
is
an
average
brew
at
best
and
is
not
really
worth
spending
hard
earned
money
on
this
beer
is
a
hazy
and
cloudy
gold
color
with
lots
of
off
white
head
and
spread
out
lace
this
beer
has
a
spicy
herbal
and
citrus
flavor
the
aroma
is
also
hoppy
herbal
too
there
are
also
esters
that
are
reminiscent
of
a
wiezen
this
beer
has
a
full
body
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
drinkability
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
could
have
by
the
pool
but
wouldnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
other
southern
tier
ales
this
beer
pours
a
semi
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
tangy
wheat
but
it
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
some
wheaty
notes
but
not
much
else
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
especially
for
a
wheat
beer
overall
this
beer
is
severely
lacking
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
d
high
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
light
and
refreshing
dgoes
down
extremely
quick
and
easy
i
feel
i
could
drink
a
whole
barrel
of
this
in
a
night
although
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
12oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
no
head
retention
zero
lacing
aromas
of
yeast
slight
lemon
and
some
hops
taste
is
somewhat
light
wheat
lemon
and
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
in
general
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
that
is
mainly
due
to
its
overall
watery
quality
not
much
here
meh
d
lawnmower
beer
refreshing
but
not
outstanding
d
trains
always
excited
to
try
a
southern
tier
brew
for
the
first
time
picked
a
422
pale
wheat
ale
from
sendiks
in
tosa
heavily
carbonated
brew
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
aroma
is
pretty
strong
on
the
wheat
earth
and
citrus
tones
taste
is
decent
earthy
orange
tones
and
light
hops
its
drinkability
is
spot
on
for
a
pale
ale
its
crisp
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
not
super
filling
pours
a
hazy
golden
aroma
of
wheat
some
light

taste
is
wheat
some

light
malts

is
light

moderate
carbonation
finish
is

some

and
citrus
ending
has
a
kind
of
nutty
after
taste
and
some
light
bitterness
overall
not
to
remarkable
but
an
ok
summer
sessionable
brew
overall
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
american
style
wheat
beers
because
they
try
to
be
too
european
and
yeasty
so
i
didnt
really
expect
to
like
this
one
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
aroma
is
quite
subdued
with
just
some
grainy
malt
and
light
hops
but
the
flavor
is
much
more
intense
and
pleasurable
this
beer
has
great
balance
which
makes
the
beer
extremely
drinkable
nice
easy
drinking
brew
drinkability
slightly
above
average
this
is
really
an
exceptional
beer
that
exceeded
my
expectations
fans
of
magic
hat
9
need
look
no
further
for
a
new
favourite
beer
drink
well
my
friends
o
below
expectations
for
a
brewery
of
this
magnitude
carbonation
is
way
too
high
flavor
is
light
refreshing
with
a
slightly
tart
edge
did
lemon
come
preinstalled
in
this
american
hefeweiss
no
theres
no
fruit
just
acid
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
which
works
well
with
the
summery
style
unfortunately
the
pale
ale
style
hops
and
weird
yeasty
funky
completely
overpower
any
wheat
flavor
the
beer
might
have
had
not
to
mention
the
serious
filtering
this
beer
has
undergone
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
hazy
light
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
the
retention
was
soso
and
the
lacing
in
tiny
broken
bands
and
spots
the
aroma
was
clearly
of
wheat
along
with
some
pale
malt
slightly
sweet
malt
and
light
floral
hops
the
flavors
were
exactly
like
the
aroma
though
not
complex
i
liked
how
straight
forward
and
refreshing
it
was
a
classic
american
wheat
ale
displaying
excellent
balance
of
the
elements
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
maybe
just
a
little
oily
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
appropriate
easy
to
drink
crisp
dry
and
no
doubt
quenching
on
a
hot
summer
day
decent
feel
and
drink
for
the
style
somewhat
coarse
and
dry
in
a
spice
sense
lightly
fruity
after
some
air
and
easy
drinking
yet
with
enough
body
to
intrigue
the
senses
in
short
very
approachable
it
seems
to
scream
springsummer
you
wouldnt
guess
the
brew
comes
in
5
8
plays
on
the
tongue
like
a
sessionable
beer
for
dishes
i
think
you
would
have
to
play
to
lighter
fare
look
towards
a
snapper
or
tilapia
kind
of
a
fish
gyros
could
be
an
interesting
way
to
as
well
by
pairing
ingredients
within
the
tzatziki
sauce
to
comparecontrast
the
422
fp
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
has
a
light
feel
but
full
flavor
as
predominantly
hopsoriented
beer
drinker
i
loved
it
as
an
alternative
to
the
bitterness
and
as
another
option
and
in
my
opinion
more
flavorful
variation
on
wheat
beers
this
really
palethin
yellow
brew
gives
a
surpisingly
robust
head
that
clings
greedily
to
the
glass
as
it
settles
smell
is
fairly
light
some
mild
hop
and
soap
and
a
mild
spice
that
i
think
is
more
like
a
really
dilute
cumin
and
herby
cilantro
than
anything
else
the
spice
is
really
faint
so
i
dunno
how
it
could
possibly
give
me
such
a
specific
impression
but
it
is
what
it
is
the
taste
is
semisweet
with
honeyish
malts
and
the
wheat
gives
a
very
nice
warm
cinnamon
like
true
fresh
cinnamon
not
the
nasty
stale
styrene
cinnamon
that
annoys
me
in
many
wheat
beers
a
little
hop
and
astringent
banana
peel
gives
it
some
bite
carbonation
is
rigorous
and
perhaps
a
bit
too
harsh
finishes
clean
from
the
carbo
with
an
aftertaste
of
pineapple
still
generating
good
lace
down
to
the
last
sip
if
the
appearance
had
more
color
or
a
bit
of
turbidity
it
wouldve
gotten
a
5
overall
i
wasnt
expecting
much
going
into
my
glass
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
nice
noninvasive
beer
that
goes
down
easy
especially
in
the
warmer
months
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
comes
out
yellow
in
color
light
sort
of
on
par
with
a
pilsner
goes
towards
gold
a
little
you
can
tell
its
not
filtered
so
its
hazy
but
still
has
a
little
clarity
to
it
white
head
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
to
it
goes
away
pretty
quick
and
just
leaves
a
ring
around
the
sides
the
smell
is
good
regardless
of
style
well
blended
hops
malt
and
wheatbarley
when
you
crack
it
open
its
initially
pretty
hoppy
but
mellows
out
after
a
few
sips
and
the
yeast
is
a
dominant
feature
of
the
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
good
like
most
of
this
style
not
aggressive
by
any
means
sweetmalty
to
start
with
complements
of
wheatbarley
and
hops
slight
citrus
pretty
well
balanced
flavor
not
a
whole
lot
stands
out
considering
i
generally
dont
like
the
overall
mouthfeel
of
this
style
i
need
to
say
im
pretty
impressed
with
422
light
bodied
and
refreshing
good
carbonation
level
finishes
clean
not
too
bitter
very
drinkable
beer
great
for
the
summer
d
these
are
very
easy
to
drink
but
come
up
a
little
short
on
flavor
value
i
wanna
say
i
paid
around
9
bucks
for
a
six
pack
thats
a
little
steep
for
a
beer
of
this
caliber
drinkability
is
moderate
the
flavor
profile
is
ok
but
its
not
what
im
going
to
reach
for
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
wheat
beer
its
ok
drinkability
would
pair
nicely
with
sauteed
sea
bass
its
light
and
simple
but
yet
its
also
pleasant
and
refreshing
exactly
what
i
needed
on
this
hot
sweltering
summers
day
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
one
finger
of
white
head
it
is
a
hazy
golden
color
the
smell
is
citrus
orange
and
pineapple
the
taste
is
pretty
satisfying
i
taste
some
yeast
and
the
citrus
flavors
this
beer
is
a
solid
offering
for
the
style
it
is
very
drinkable
the
taste
is
not
bad
for
a
usa
beer
i
had
worser
ones
beer
is
reasonable
drinkable
nothing
outstanding
here
but
it
was
completely
enjoyable
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
satisfying
summer
brew
imo
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
wheat
and
grains
with
some
spices
taste
is
also
of
wheat
and
spices
a
touch
of
hops
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
this
is
no
oberon
or
gumballhead
just
a
standard
issue
wheat
beer
overall
i
believe
my
3rd
paragraph
says
it
all
im
very
stumped
on
this
ale
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
next
maybe
the
flavor
ferry
got
pissed
at
this
bottle
and
took
away
its
flavor
i
will
buy
again
but
they
are
hard
to
find

very
clear

knock

off

wont
fail
at
quenching
your
thirst
moreys
bottom
line
not
a
whole

to
offer
as
far
as

goes
but
i
still
think
that
this
beer
achieves
what
it
sets
out
to
be
pours

the

it
does
go
down
pretty
smooth
with
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
not
a
bad
wheat
beer
overall
an
aboveaverage
wheat
beer
but
just
so
easy
drinkability
goes
down
easy
but
not
very
interesting
a
rather
basic
brew
not
as
refreshing
as
i
had
hoped
for
still
not
bad
though
needs
a
little
more
hop
presence
not

bad
poured

fresh
mown
hay

flavor
is
like
aroma
and
has
the
bittersweetness
which
predominantly
sweet
decent
body
and
carbonation
finish
is
medium
in
length
as
is
more
tart
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
which
is
odd
considering
the
strength
well
its
drinkable
though
the
style
itself
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
drinkability
a
somewhat
unintereting
but
drinkable
little
beer
drinkability
honestly
not
bad
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
deceived
by
this
beer
is
my
moral
judgment
getting
in
the
way
of
enjoying
this
drinkability
great
summer
beer
not
a
big
wheat
guy
but
i
like
dthis
one
better
flavor
than
oberon
not
overly
thick
with
decent
bitterness
to
mask
the
wheat
base
lighter
body
with
adequate
carbonation
alcohol
is
hidden
very
easy
to
drink
althought
not
a
great
deal
of
flavor
seems
a
lot
like
a
solid
lager
smell
is
a
light
and
sweet
citrus
with
a
green
grass
hops
the
wheat
does
give
a
crisp
lemony
flavor
very
light
and
refreshing
clean
body
still
for
10
theres
not
a
whole
lot
more
going
for
this
another
thing
you
can
do
thats
green
is
buy
local
save
your
cash
and
get
a
boulevard
unfiltered
wheat
for
six
or
seven
bucks
a
little
cheaper
but
a
lot
better
d
i
like
the
earth
day
conceptname
and
it
is
tasty
but
their
hop
sun
is
a
better
wheat
beer
this
is
very
drinkable
stuff
a
bit
light
but
not
insultingly
so
the
style
should
be
delicate
i
would
be
nice
if
it
had
a
bit
more
yeasty
bite
but
it
will
do
i
would
buy
this
on
its
own
but
the
way
it
is
i
hope
they
keep
selling
the
12
pack
with
four
different
pales
in
it
it
will
prove
very
difficult
picking
a
favorite
i
may
need
to
drink
several
cases
to
ponder
this
for
kids
who
arent
down
with
the
wheat
beer
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
probably
the
lowest
rated
s
t
brew
but
you
can
drink
em
all
day
and
not
get
as
crunked
as
you
do
on
the
other
s
t
d
this
is
a
really
nice
refreshing
beer
the
body
was
crisp
but
a
bit
thin
drinkability
was
nice
if
unspectacular
if
this
beer
were
local
for
me
id
probably
get
it
on
occasion
but
i
can
get
local
brews
that
are
fresher
this
brew
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
pours
a
clear
gold
that
has
heavy
carbonation
for
a
fizzy
head
that
doesnt
cling
to
the
glass
a
mix
of
pale
malt
and
citric
hops
but
has
a
tad
bit
of
veggie
smell
that
is
slightly
putting
off
more
malty
than
hoppy
this
light
and
crisp
bodied
beer
has
a
decent
balance
and
tastes
like
a
mix
of
mild
bread
and
sweet
malt
along
with
some
citric
hops
and
peppery
spices
finishing
clean
and
slightly
sticky
i
enjoyed
this
beer
although
wont
make
a
habit
of
drinking
it
as
it
is
just
a
lil
bit
offkilter
d
pretty
good
drinkability
i
dont
know
how
much
i
would
want
to
drink
but
i
could
drink
a
bunch
really
an
unimpressive
wheat
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
head
that
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
citrus
types
of
aromas
with
hints
of
grass
and
wheat
taste
is
a
bit
mild
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
toward
the
back
end
overall
a
bit
to
light
for
my
likings
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
the
their
other
fine
offerings
from
st
body
is
just
a
tad
lighter
than
medium
carbonation
is
a
bit
lower
than
i
thought
it
would
be
but
thats
certainly
not
a
bad
thing
very
very
drinkable
great
beer
for
the
higher
temperatures
d
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
american
style
wheat
beers
and
didnt
really
expect
to
like
this
one
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
aroma
is
quite
subdued
with
just
some
grainy
malt
and
light
hops
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
more
intense
there
is
a
surprisingly
nice
malt
character
that
has
a
richness
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
good
pilsner
and
a
light
but
earthy
hop
character
that
balances
nicely
and
makes
the
beer
quaffable
the
style
is
inherently
limited
and
it
is
hard
to
imagine
the
beer
being
interesting
or
complex
without
becoming
something
else
entirely
but
this
beer
is
quite
nice
for
what
it
is
cheers
d
overall
a
decent
brew
but
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
d
reminds
me
of
a
light
pilsner
with
a
slight
wheat
quality
unfortunately
422
fits
into
my
general
opinion
of
southern
tier
beers
big
bottle
good
small
bottle
mwah
although
there
are
a
few
exceptions
like
hop
sun
overall
this
is
a
very
average
beer
m
d
refreshing
crisp
and
light
great
for
spring
and
even
summer
d
couldnt
finish
the
12oz
bottle
d
i
can
see
where
the
brewer
is
going
with
this
but
not
my
favorite
combination
of
flavours
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
straw
color
with
a
fast
fading
thin
white
head
leaving
no
lace
smell
mildly
sweet
neutral
pale
malt
character
a
little
husk
taste
medium
sweet
a
bit
of
tangy
wheat
fading
into
mild
grassy
and
spicy
hops
might
be
imagining
some
lemon
light
bodied
and
a
little
soapy
in
the
finish
easy
drinking
but
boring
picked
up
a
single
to
try
this
is
a
light
flavor
wheat
beer
interesting
fruit
flavors
from
the
yeast
would
make
this
a
decent
choice
if
it
was
inexpensive
decent
ale
as
other
reviews
state
it
tastes
more
like
a
very
mild
pilsner
its
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
think
it
is
indeed
very
sessionable
it
just
depends
on
what
you
are
looking
for
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
i
would
get
it
on
tap
somewhere
if
there
were
no
better
options
for
me
this
is
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
i
had
no
clue
it
is
above
5
until
i
checked
the
southern
tier
site
and
the
flavours
just
work
so
well
a
perfect
summer
quaffer
good
sessionable
brew
that
is
a
bit
too
light
but
would
be
a
welcome
brew
for
summer
gatherings
this
is
a
good
drinking
brew
is
pleasant
and
would
go
nice
on
a
hot
day
with
some
bbq
decent
one
of
the
better
in
the
pack
of
pales
but
far
from
desirable
while
not
being
anything
earth
shattering
it
is
definitly
something
i
would
have
no
issue
with
having
a
couple
of
very
solid
indeed
ive
had
this
served
from
a
bottle
at
a
local
bar
and
i
have
to
say
i
got
much
more
of
a
taste
experience
straight
from
the
bottle
overall
a
solid
southern
tier
brew
certainly
ideal
to
have
with
you
sitting
by
your
pool
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
brew
pours
a
goldenyellow
hue
with
average
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
head
and
average
lacingthe
aromas
are
bubble
gum
and
sweet
wheatit
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
bubble
gumhoney
infused
lemonits
definately
an
original
beer
thats
easy
enough
to
drink
although
not
the
best
of
this
brewerys
brews
but
would
buy
again
and
wouldnt
knock
it
back
if
offered
d
very
drinkable
since
this
one
wasnt
too
complicated
and
too
heavy
it
was
a
perfect
summer
porch
beer
d
i
can
maybe
see
this
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
right
now
i
am
not
feeling
it
its
crisp
but
has
only
a
slight
wheaty
sweet
taste
actually
more
of
a
fruity
and
soapy
taste
to
it
bubbly
on
the
tongue
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
but
its
not
a
standout
either
pale
and
hazy
sun
yellow
tone
thin
bubbly
dirty
white
head
no
carbonation
noted
by
appearance
great
aroma
of
citrus
lemon
tangy

and
bready
malts
solid
flavor
of
bready
pils
like
malts
and
spicy
peppery
hop
accents
theres
a
quenching
citrus
feel
to
it
as
well
with
lemon
being
the
main
player
in
the
citric
dept
nice
all
around
and
balanced
as
well
a
little
bit
of
a
chalky
finish
which
actually
is
not
out
of
place
at
all
full
flavored
feel
in
the
mouth
lightly
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
move
over
blue
moon
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
seek
this
out
and
drink
over
blue
moon
any
day
drinkability
is
average
i
put
this
one
only
a
notch
or
two
above
the
adjunct
lagers
out
there
as
much
as
i
love
southern
tier
this
one
is
lame
ill
use
the
old
cliche
that
this
is
a
lawnmower
beer
through
and
through
i
really
cannot
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
pours
a
pale
golden
colour
with
a
tight
head
that
fades
into
a
alright
lacing
the
wheat
beer
smell
is
certainly
present
though
lemony
scents
also
come
through
especially
after
sitting
for
a
few
minutes
taste
is
good
with
wheat
and
malt
present
as
one
would
expect
for
this
style
but
the
hops
are
considerably
more
pronounced
than
one
would
usually
expect
in
a
beer
such
as
this
and
thats
good
thing
medium
bodied
and
a
noticeable
lack
of
carbonation
which
suits
me
just
fine
a
very
good
wheat
beer
that
i
would
definitely
reccomend

some

initially

basic

good
very
drinkable
not
too
wheaty
actually
im
surprised
by
such
low
ratings
of
this
beer
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
smooth
in
a
crisp
and
refreshing
way
there
is
no
gravitas
to
the
feel
of
this
brew
just
clean
simple
wheat
beer
bready
feel
but
lighter
i
prefer
the
more
aggressive
hop
sun
or
even
the
st
pilsner
but
this
is
a
nice
option
to
get
people
off
the
mega
brews
imo
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
in
the
warm
months
but
isnt
my
favorite
wheat
beer
drinkability
has
a
good
drinkability
but
suffers
from
not
having
enough
personality
for
me
poured
into
a
hefe
glass
color
was
a
hazy
amber
with
a
white
head
the
head
didnt
last
long
at
all
and
ended
up
leaving
a
thin
layer
on
top
small
to
moderate
amounts
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
fruity
sweet
initially
reminded
me
of
a
dry
cider
later
became
a
light
wheat
bread
smell
taste
was
a
bit
malty
but
also
reminded
me
of
a
smokey
nut
flavor
felt
very
good
in
the
mouth
coated
nicely
and
just
a
bit
of
carbonation
pleasant
to
drink
almost
sessionable
drinkability
this
beer
was
nicely
refreshing
and
a
quick
drinking
beer
nice
offering
here
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
although
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
notes
my
least
favorite
st
beer
one
i
am
sure
that
is
intended
as
a
session
beer
just
none
of
my
sessions
not
impressed
with
this
one
drink
is
decent
there
really
is
nothing
to
this
beer
but
i
could
have
a
few
more
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
the
aroma
is
almost
entirely
of
wheat
malt
very
little
in
the
way
of
spice
or
fruit
clean
but
not
very
exciting
the
flavor
follows
without
any
surprises
the
clean
crisp
aroma
makes
for
any
easy
session
beer
a
nice
clear
golden
straw
color
body
with
a
short
white
head
leaving
some
spotty
lace
medium
carbonation
aroma
of
light
sweet
malt
wheat
bread
crust
and
a
hint
of
citrus
flavor
is
very
light
it
has
hints
of
tangy
wheat
malt
citrus
honey
and
faint
grassy
hops
very
balanced
light
body
with
a
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
slightly
dry
finish
with
very
little
aftertaste
i
would
think
this
to
be
very
sessionable
i
could
drink
5
or
8
on
a
hot
day
not
the
best
pale
wheat
ive
had
but
a
very
good
brew
to
try
single
twelveouncer
copped
from
joe
canals
in
lawrenceville
was
rather
dissapointed
with
this
pale
wheat
ale
from
southern
tier
a
new
york
brewery
i
typically
associate
with
special
oneofakind
beers
bitter
nonflavorful
and
tasteless
not
impressed
at
all
it
is
however
drinkable
and
would
be
great
during
the
summer
months
and
into
early
fall
like
i
mentioned
before
my
new
favorite
wheat
southern
tier
once
again
goes
above
and
beyond
the
call
of
duty
they
could
have
easily
put
out
a
runofthemill
standard
wheat
im
lucky
enought
to
have
these
guys
local
well
3
hrs
away
overall
just
an
average
wheat
ale
not
really
much
to
say
about
it
drinkability
is
high
in
the
context
of
hotday
summer
beer
drinking
id
way
rather
have
one
of
these
than
a
macro
lager
this
is
a
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
thats
great
for
the
summertime
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
also
seems
like
a
great
choice
for
someone
new
to
craft
beer
that
isnt
sure
of
their
tastes
yet
poured
mildly
cloudy
with
a
good
lace
and
very
tiny
bubbles
smells
sweet
almost
like
a
yogurt
with
hints
of
peach
and
a
touch
of
grapefruit
mouth
is
very
creamy
mild
hops
going
down
with
very
little
aftertaste
maybe
a
trix
remainder
taste
was
a
let
down
bites
from
hops
slight
alcohol
slight
malty
wheat
taste
at
the
front
it
seems
like
it
ends
there
slight
grapefruit
overtone
but
otherwise
the
mouth
makes
a
better
impression
than
the
taste
this
almost
seems
like
a
light
beer
one
and
done
for
me
very
good
drinkability
would
order
again
well
done
d
easy
drinker
perfect
for
people
wanting
to
explore
into
craft
beer
and
for
anybody
who
just
wants
to
drink
something
really
cold
and
refreshing
i
really
liked
it
i
would
love
to
have
a
keg
of
this
at
a
summer
bbq
d
very
good
drinkability
excellent
for
a
hot
day
like
today
this
is
a
good
summer
beer
for
a
bbq
refreshing
crisp
and
super
clean
overall
not
very
impressive
from
a
brewery
that
usually
knocks
my
socks
off
seems
pretty
standard
and
boring
luckily
there
are
three
other
great
beers
in
the
pack
of
pales
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
a
nice
light
golden
color
and
white
head
looked
inviting
as
did
the
smell
of
the
wheat
with
hints
of
orange
this
is
definitely
a
light
one
and
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
blow
you
away
with
complexity
and
depth
of
flavors
this
is
not
for
one
that
being
said
this
is
a
nice
brew
for
what
it
is
and
difinitely
fits
the
bill
for
a
warm
and
sunny
summer
day
another
decent
offering
from
southern
tier
light
body
with
ok
carb
best
part
about
it
was
just
that
it
was
in
eco
friendly
packaging
drinkability
this
tastes
almost
like
a
hefe
without
the
bite
a
very
good
inoffensive
session
beer
could
have
several
especially
in
warmer
weather
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
very
little
carbonation
no
head
aroma
is
almost
not
there
citrus
sweet
grassy
wheat
notes
a
little
lemony
sour
notes
easy
to
drink
light
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
my
thinking
is
that
it
is
a
summer
ale
offering
nice
variety
in
the
pack
of
pales
the
drink
is
lightbodied
with
good
carbonation
and
is
as
quaffable
as
all
get
out
on
a
hot
muggy
day
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
the
smell
is
of
citrus
and
of
wheat
the
taste
is
wheat
with
a
very
slight
lemon
taste
and
very
little
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
very
light
carbonation
and
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
drinkability
is
high
you
could
have
a
lot
of
them
not
as
complex
as
other
southern
tier
beers
but
very
smooth
and
very
good
drinkability
while
its
not
necessarily
nice
to
look
at
and
the
smells
and
flavors
arent
quite
as
potent
as
i
would
like
i
could
probably
sit
thorugh
a
few
of
these
especially
with
that
low
abv
no
german
hefeweizens
in
the
fridge
i
dont
know
if
you
can
do
much
better
than
this
for
a
nonhoppy
american
version
worth
trying
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
bright
white
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
golden
brew
head
falls
rapidly
down
a
layer
of
teensy
bubbles
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
minimally
of
cloves
banana
and
ctrus
taste
starts
with
the
same
light
wheat
character
but
quickly
gives
way
to
a
tang
of
citrus
and
moderate
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
smooth
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
standard
american
pale
wheat
more
or
less
side
note
southern
tier
brews
the
422
in
commemoration
of
earth
day
as
the
bottles
are
packaged
in
80
recycled
materials
d
the
low
abv
thin
nature
and
refreshing
nature
make
this
one
go
down
easily
d
nice
drinkability
with
the
herbal
and
floral
hops
playing
well
against
the
wheat
backing
gives
this
just
the
right
amount
of
balance
between
an
american
wheat
and
pale
doesnt
go
down
as
easy
as
a
wheat
nor
is
as
crisp
as
a
pale
but
does
its
job
as
a
summer
quencher
with
above
average
regards
had
a
six
pack
of
this
on
a
lazy
hot
summer
afternoon
and
would
go
well
as
a
modest
picnic
beer
with
light
conversation
taste
was
average
in
feel
but
a
bit
unique
the
wheat
malts
were
there
as
expected
but
i
also
had
hints
of
citrus
specifically
orange
fairly
prevailant
an
interesting
pale
wheat
ale
and
one
of
the
better
ones
in
my
book
simply
because
it
breaks
the
mold
recommended
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
seems
a
bit
filling
for
what
it
is
still
glad
to
try
this
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
home
state
regional
bias
honestly
i
cant
say
anything
that
hasnt
already
been
said
its
a
decent
brew
up
to
par
with
most
of
the
southern
tier
sixers
but
just
nothing
too
special
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
a
good
beer
that
is
definitely
worth
a
try
better
than
most
american
pale
aleswheat
ales
but
im
not
sure
if
its
worth
a
repeat
purchase
drinkability
is
so
so
but
in
the
end
to
me
this
is
no
more
then
a
full
flavored
lager
that
is
10
a
sixer
i
am
just
glad
i
got
one
in
a
mix
six
but
never
again
unless
its
free
tastes
like
any
massproduced
pale
lager
with
a
hint
of
wheat
taste
this
just
doesnt
taste
like
anything
special
it
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
at
the
same
time
i
cant
really
call
it
good
either
not
terribly
expensive
but
i
would
call
it
overpriced
for
what
is
essentially
lawnmower
beer
this
should
come
in
a
30pack
for
under
20
d
this
was
pretty
good
i
definitely
enjoy
their
hopsun
more
than
this
for
summer
souther
tier
beers
southern
tier
usually
puts
the
craft
beer
pedal
to
the
metal
with
the
majority
of
their
new
releases
coming
in
the
blackwater
series
of
imperial
ales
422
pale
wheat
ale
is
a
return
to
smaller
simpler
beer
its
a
fine
effort
and
should
sell
pretty
well
but
there
isnt
enough
excitement
here
to
warrant
a
repeat
purchase
nice
beer
worth
trying
drinkability
a
decent
beer
overall
there
isnt
enough
wheat
for
me
unless
i
am
missing
something
worth
a
try
a
nice
clean
simple
beer
a
nofrills
lightbodied
pale
wheat
standard
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
a
quick
refresher
but
thats
about
it
i
guess
they
wanted
to
keep
it
basic
for
earth
day
and
they
did
a
bland
but
generally
inoffensive
brew
pours
a
deeep
yellow
hazey
corn
color
with
a
quick
film
of
head
after
the
pour
and
some
good
the
aroma
has
dry
banana
peels
herbal
cloves
and
sweet
wheat
the
taste
starts
and
finishes
with
super
dry
green
apple
powder
the
middle
has
a
more
grainy
wheat
favor
and
husky
palate
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
very
dry
and
super
grain
at
times
not
bad
for
a
session
wheat
ale
easy
drinking
that
is
for
sure
but
the
lack
of
character
takes
away
my
interest
in
having
more
than
one
bottom
line
the
packaging
is
loaded
with
all
sorts
of
celebrations
of
earth
day
recycling
etc
i
believe
that
this
brew
matches
its
packaging
perfectly
try
it
maybe
youll
enjoy
this
green
brew
pours
a
pale
yellow
as
expected
with
a
small
white
head
a
shy
nose
of
toasty
wheat
and
citrusy
hops
very
easy
drinking
good
flavor
very
soft
and
with
a
slightly
bigger
hop
character
than
most
other
summerspring
wheats
very
refreshing
i
will
revisit
this
one
again
for
sure
im
loving
the
draught
possibilities
every
bottle
ive
had
screams
heineken
at
me
hardly
any
wheat
and
nothing
much
pleasant
what
a
great
idea
an
earthawareness
beer
but
this
one
flops
and
thats
coming
from
someone
who
likes
southern
tier
and
ordinarily
loves
this
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
while
it
isnt
super
complex
what
wheat
beer
is
it
is
enjoyable
to
drink
in
the
evening
with
some
bratwurst
or
alone
while
watching
some
baseball
overall
not
very
impressive
but
i
suppose
it
could
be
a
decent
hotweather
beer
i
will
recycle
the
empty
bottles
d
just
not
a
good
enough
beer
to
want
to
drink
a
touch
of
pepper
some
wheat
the
aftertaste
quickly
dies
with
some
sourness
decent
body
with
a
slightly
high
carbonation

sits

a

on

at

more
of
a
wheat
beer
than
a
pale
ale
although
it
has
aspects
of
both
a
decent
drink
nothing
amazing
overall
impression
for
the
most
part
a
solid
american
wheat
the
only
really
disapointing
part
was
the
lack
of
head
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
drinkable
but
not
exactly
the
most
startling
of
brews
it
might
be
the
style
doesnt
lend
itself
to
complexity
but
southern
tier
does
what
it
can
still
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink

very

is
rather
surprising
in
how
basic
and
uncraft
like
it
is
dont
get
me
wrong
you
can
enjoy
this
but
i
really
dont
know
why
id
buy
it
again
when
southern
tiers
own
ipa
is
around
the
same
price
and
so
much
more
pleasing
this
is
a
good
gateway
beer
but
a
little
tough
to
recommend
even
so
give
it
a
go
yourself
and
make
up
your
own
mind
d
not
aweful
but
not
really
anything
to
write
home
about
lots
of
better
wheat
beers
out
there
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
2
fingers
of
bright
white
head
ok
retention
and
a
little
bit
of
spotty
lacing
smells
of

lightly
toasted

apricot
light
grassy
notes
and
a

finish
medium

body
with
ok
carbonation
clean
with
tolerable
flavors
and
a
nice
little
pop
of
bitter
in
the
back
end
really
easy
to
drink
but
overall
something
id
get
bored
with
quickly
southern
tier
422
is
a
hazy
pale
golden
ale
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
that
fades
but
leaves
nice
lacing
there
are
notes
of
lemon
grass
and
bread
in
the
aroma
it
has
a
very
smooth
mediumlight
body
with
a
clean
finish
it
is
very
lightly
flavored
with
wheat
and
lemon
theres
not
much
bitterness
to
speak
of
its
slightly
sweet
at
the
finish
its
very
refreshing
and
very
sessionable
drinkability
really
high
definitely
could
be
a
summer
staple
pale
ale
clear
pale
gold
holds
a
solid
misting
of
head
the
flavor
is
simply
dry
wheat
and
a
mild
lemony
acidity
clean
and
simple
with
a
light
body
and
sparkly
carbonation
finishes
clean
with
a
bit
of
a
wheaty
tang
nothing
special
but
very
good
on
a
hot
day
one
of
the
better
american
wheat
beers
out
there
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
light
but
flavorful
and
i
got
what
i
wanted
id
prefer
the
hop
sun
but
i
thought
id
give
this
a
go
d
pretty
high
but
probably
because
i
am
drinking
it
at
the
right
time
of
year
and
fresh
which
you
should
anyway
there
are
far
worse
representations
of
this
style
out
there
and
on
a
hot
day
or
a
warm
rainy
night
this
beer
really
hits
to
proverbial
spot
was
expecting
more
out
of
this
reminds
me
of
a
well
done
macro
lager
without
any
adjuncts
in
it
m
a
softer
carbonation
but
its
still
prickly
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
with
a
nice
and
refreshing
finish
quite
a
decent
brew
all
around
and
ultimately
better
than
i
would
have
hoped
good
soft
drinkable
beer
d
a
good
brew
with
some
interesting
palate
tricks
and
flavors
the
aroma
are
mildly
adventurous
as
well
cheers
i
miss
hop
sun
that
may
be
my
next
case
this
is
shite
in
comparison
but
as
an
american
pale
wheat
its
kind
of
interesting
appears
a
pale
yellow
apple
juice
completely
filtered
hue
bright
white
head
forms
thick
and
dwindles
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
nice
collar
of
lacing
around
the
wheat
beer
glass
im
drinking
out
of
nice
fine
speckled
lacing
with
each
gulp
aroma
has
a
reverent
grassy
herbal
flow
thats
almost
spicy
at
times
i
like
it
a
clean
light
toasted
malt
base
for
some
mild
sweetness
very
much
like
lemongrass
flavor
is
nice
the
wheat
adds
a
very
cereal
tone
to
the
whole
mix
light
biscuit
sweetness
with
heavy
grassiness
and
dhammomile
tea
with
more
lemongrass
herbs
not
much
hop
action
maybe
just
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
easy
drinking
completely
downable
one
of
those
brews
that
are
meant
to
be
drank
in
session
during
the
grass
cuttying
earth
days
better
than
another
imperial
wtf
creation
overall
pretty
enjoyable
doesnt
transcend
but
nails
a
hard
to
like
style
d
session
beer
for
what
it
is
very
nice
i
enjoy
my
wheat
beers
and
i
like
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
the
beer
from
a
thematic
perspective
is
the
beer
excellent
no
is
it
drinkable
definately
a
12

purchased
at

in

for

into

color
with
a
thick
finger
of
quickly
fading
fluffy
white
foam
a
thin
lace
is
left
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
as
i
sip
my
way
to
the
bottom
smells
fresh
and
crisp
with
notes
of
grass
and
lemon
very
pleasant
nose
tastes
of
lightly
toasted
grains
grassy
earthy
hops
bread
mild
citrus
such
as
lemon
and
a
faint
spiciness
towards
the
crisp
finish
for
the
style
this
ale
is
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
with
a
quickly
dissipating
bitterness

very
crisp
taste
with
a
slightly
sweet
note
bready
grainy
notes
and
just
a
hint
of
lemon
this
is
a
solid
pale

and
is
so
crisp
that
it
just
reminds
me
a
spring
day

drinkable

dry

left
tracing
down

ive
ever
tasted
this
flavor
in
a
beer
kinda
neutral
about
it
orange
rind
and
flowery
lemon
flavors
on
the
palate
highly
drinkable
this
does
smell
like
spring
d
given
the
right
occasion
nothing
wrong
here
but
its
almost
over
before
you
get
a
chance
to
comprehend
it
not
much
to
chew
on
i
will
finish
the
six
but
look
forward
to
another
version
from

overall
i
think
its
a

enough

its
not
something
id
drink
all
the
time

id
buy
it
every
once

color
with
a

fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
very
basic
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
with
little
else
going
on
there
is
a
light
hop
aroma
and
apparent
dryness
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
good
it
tastes
just
as
advertised
a
pale
wheat
ale
of
course
southern
tier
is
known
for
pushing
the
envelope
for
what
a
beer
should
be
but
this
one
is
just
a
solid
well
brewed
beer
its
smooth
with
little
bitterness
and
dry
wheat
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
thats
a
bit
light
on
carbonation
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
although
if
im
looking
for
a
wheat
beer
from
southern
tier
ill
pick
up
a
sixer
of
hop
sun
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retentionbut
decent
laceing
aroma
is
of
tart
fruits
nice
but
weak
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
tangywith
a
slightly
bitter
finish
a
watered
down
version
of
hop
sun
not
up
to
southern
tiers
usual
standard
in
my
opinion
but
worth
a
try
too
sweet
unfiltered
so
it
is
cloudy
however
the
large
floaters
were
off
putting
maybe
the
bottle
was
too
old
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
for
a
beer
of
this
strength
alcohol
presence
and
bite
are
very
light
the
bitterness
offset
by
fruity
sweetness
and
somewhat
sour
finish
are
more
pronounced
not
bad
at
all
wheat
and
mango
i
expected
sweet
but
really
sour
this
is
pretty
solid
but
honestly
kind
of
unexciting
and
i
dont
really
want
to
ever
have
it
again
o
the
overwhelming
sourness
ruins
this
one
the
only
reason
i
would
try
it
again
is
to
make
sure
this
wasnt
just
a
bad
bottle
tastes
like
fresh
mango
perfect
pairing
with
thai
food
the
smell
is
wheat
mango
a
little
honey
citrus
and
malt
the
mango
is
the
most
dominant
smell
with
just
a
tad
bit
of
alcohol
the
flavor
is
mango
citrus
tartness
earthy
wheat
and
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
a
bit
puckering
like
a
wild
ale
it
does
drink
much
better
than
10
but
you
have
to
really
like
mango
to
be
into
this
one
d
this
was
a
decent
fruity
wheat
beer
the
scent
wasnt
great
but
the
taste
was
better
and
the
body
was
great
it
had
a
fairly
smooth
finish
too
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
probably
not
for
aging
although
the
bottle
suggests
otherwise
consumed
7
months
have
one
more
bottle
and
i
think
i
might
let
it
sit
23
years
and
see
what
happens
12
oz
bottle
fine
wheat
ale
unfortunately
my
pint
suffered
an
accident
and
id
like
to
try
this
again
overall
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
i
love
some
good
fruit
beers
only
drawback
was
getting
this
too
late
bottled
on
61014
after
5
months
it
really
collected
sediment
would
get
it
again
very
tart
and
fruity
like
a
high
abv
lambic
o
a
lot
going
on
here
as
expected
and
the
end
result
is
quite
good
the
alcoholsweetnesstartness
dynamic
is
pretty
onpoint
with
no
one
element
overpowering
the
other
o
a
very
nice
blend
of
sour
beer
and
wheat
beer
definitely
shows
both
characters
well
and
certainly
blends
them
well
extremely
easy
to
drink
for
being
on
the
tart
side
and
10
definitely
worth
giving
it
a
try
very
fruity
hard
to
believe
its
10
surprisingly
good
o
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
with
a
american
pale
wheat
ale
that
clocks
in
at
10
abv
but
this
is
not
as
light
and
easy
to
drink
as
others
in
the
style
a
little
heavy
handed
with
the
alcohol
but
not
as
intense
as
weyerbacher
tends
to
be
3
65
o
an
interesting
flavor
but
one
im
unsure
of
drinking
in
multiples
tart
fruitiness
some
sourness
factors
in
with
a
manageable
alcohol
content
that
is
probably
much
higher
then
perceived
consumed
young
maybe
some
aging
is
in
order
overall
a
decent
blend
of
a
soured
ale
and
wheat
ale
the
mango
kind
of
gets
lost
still
quite
enjoyable

a
slightly
sour
wheat
ale
with
superbly
hidden
booze
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
i
really
wonder
what
this
would
be
like
in
2019
so
much
funk
here
that
really
overcomes
and
outlasts
the
initial
tartness
really
interesting
beer
here
that
i
would
like
to
see
how
it
ages
o
ive
been
patiently
waiting
for
this
beer
since
i
heard
they
were
making
it
im
a
sucker
for
mango
big
wheat
beers
and
weyerbacher
i
wasnt
let
down
i
very
much
appreciated
the
sour
flavors
present
here
i
would
have
liked
a
little
bit
more
mango
flavor
another
great
beer
from
this
imperial
anniversary
series
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thick
but
fizzy
white
head
a
few
sprays
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
pale
sweetness
and
wheat
cracker
dried
mango
and
other
soft
fruit
a
swirl
and
theres
a
vaguely
banana
pudding
thing
then
its
gone
and
just
a
pale
wheat
w
sweetened
dried
mango
taste
out
of
nowhere
this
is
tart
lactic
which
is
good
because
otherwise
it
would
be
just
cloying
undercarbonated
pale
malt
overload
sugary
mango
again
then
tart
jolly
rancher
finish
sticky
sneakily
boozy
post
swallow
this
is
rough
but
theres
one
point
in
the
sip
where
its
an
interesting
idea
then
a
sugar
wave
hits
and
its
rough
again
get
rid
of
the
anniversary
beers
are
10
motto
and
try
this
again
im
usually
a
big
fan
of
weyerbachers
anniversary
beers
but
im
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
one
it
sounded
like
something
that
would
be
up
my
alley
but
the
sweetness
is
really
over
the
top
for
me
its
still
a
unique
take
on
the
style
its
not
bad
its
just
not
for
me
d
ive
been
a
huge
fan
of
the
weyerbacher
anniversary
series
since
close
to
the
beginning
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
for
me
a
bit
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
lofty
expectation
that
i
typically
carry
for
the
annual
offering
its
an
interesting
and
aggressive
attempt
at
something
new
and
while
i
commend
that
it
falls
a
bit
short
of
achieving
what
i
think
it
set
out
to
do
it
does
hide
the
highabv
rather
well
overall
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
wheat
beer
good
mango
and
spice
presence
with
a
nice
controlled
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
medium
body
not
boozy
at
all
and
moderately
well
carbonated
i
actually
liked
this
beer
if
youre
into
anything
tart
or
if
you
like
fruity
beers
but
want
a
little
more
intrigue
o
almost
lambic
in
its
fruity
carbonatedness
basically
highly
carbonated
alcoholic
fruit
juice
with
little
balance
good
if
you
like
that
kind
of
thing
or
possibly
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
overall
4
0
im
not
saying
i
have
a
better
style
classification
in
mind
for
this
beer
but
did
someone
list
this
as
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
as
a
joke
maybe
fruitvegetable
beer
would
be
better
or
american
wild
consequently
im
rating
this
not
to
style
but
to
whatever
the
hell
impression
it
makes
on
me
that
being
the
case
i
think
this
is
a
fascinating
and
very
enjoyable
even
if
not
transcendent
exploration
of
style
its
creative
its
welldone
it
pushes
some
boundaries
but
not
outrageously
so
and
its
memorable
for
how
unique
it
is
if
nothing
else
best
weyerbacher
anniversary
beer
in
a
few
years
really
liking
this
one
never
had
anything
like
it
this
was
a
single
going
back
for
a
case
for
sure
pours
into
a

that
is
gone
pretty
quickly

alot
going
on
in
the
nose
with
the
mango
at
the
for
front
along
with
some
light
phenol
spice
and
sweet
alcoholsmell
like
alcoholic
candy
flavors
have
a
bit
of
a
sourness
to
them
wich
took
me
by
surprise
a
little
to
go
along
with
the
tropical
fruitinessphenol
yeasty
spiceand
sweet
alcohol
in
the
finish
sometimes
the
big
weyerbacher
beers
can
be
a
little
heavy
handed
in
the
alcohol
department
this
one
not
to
muchalthough
it
plays
a
role
all
the
flavors
come
together
pretty
well
here
nice
job
overall
i
would
get
this
beer
again
and
really
enjoyed
it
a
very
good
representation
for
an
anniversary
brew
o
this
is
a
solid
likeable
and
easy
to
drink
beer
different
than
what
i
expected
but
good
nonetheless
grabbed
this
one
on
draft
at
roast
house
in
frederick
good
looking
beer
with
a
decent
smell
with
noticeable
alcohol
taste
is
excellent
more
sweet
than
tart
but
really
smooth
and
the
way
the
taste
covers
the
alcohol
makes
it
crazy
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
overall
oh
man
thats
some
good
sipping
stuff
there
definitely
happy
i
got
this
i
dont
understand
the
high
ratings
mango
where
all
i
get
is
sour
beer
sour
beer
is
sour
beer
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
if
you
like
sour
beer
huh
then
this
is
for
you
i
am
sure
this
will
be
a
one
time
brew
weyerbacher
this
experiment
failed
o
this
is
pretty
good
worth
trying
quickly
summery
of
the
beer
would
be
a
some
tart
hefe
with
mango
o
this
another
winner
from
weyerbacher
and
hope
i
can
score
a
bit
more
before
its
gone
than
my
initial
4pack
although
this
an
ageable
brew
i
would
abstain
as
i
think
the
balance
is
remarkable
now
and
think
the
tartness
will
gain
momentum
and
become
more
prominent
i
e
more
sour
as
time
passes
their
anniversary
releases
are
always
inventive
and
wellcrafted
of
which
nineteen
continues
that
trend
happy
anniversary
weyerbacher
and
to
many
more
4

d
extremely
drinkable
for
a
beer
at
10
all
over
the
place
with
elements
of
different
styles
it
looks
and
feels
like
a
pale
ale
with
a
nice
wheat
flavor
on
the
finish
you
dont
get
too
much
hops
as
you
may
expect
with
a
pale
ale
and
there
really
is
no
malt
backing
it
has
elements
of
the
gose
and
gueuze
styles
as
well
interesting
beer
but
would
probably
not
purchase
again
overall
really
good
beer
im
wishing
i
had
picked
up
a
4
pack
rather
than
a
single
sourness
is
only
mild
but
works
well
with
the
base
beer
and
compliments
the
mango
nicely
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
bottled
on
6614
enjoy
by
6619
the
mango
character
tastes
more
like
apricots
to
me
drinks
really
easy
for
10
pretty
unique
offering
from
weyerbacher
definitely
worth
a
try
o
super
happy
i
picked
up
a
case
of
this
limited
release
i
will
be
going
through
the
bottles
slowly
and
be
sure
to
hide
some
to
age
over
the
next
few
years
overall
im
glad
i
have
a
four
pack
of
this
im
still
working
my
way
toward
complete
appreciation
of
sourtart
beers
but
i
am
enjoying
this
one
o
no
heat
whatsoever
for
a
10
beer
dangerously
drinkable
with
the
hidden
abv
refreshing
best
wheat
ever
lightly
tart
banana
citrus
smooth
love
it
really
cold
refreshing
beautiful
color
and
head
winner
overall
this
is
likely
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
and
considering
by
definition
these
beers
are
somewhat
weak
this
one
sporting
only
4
4abv
it
is
very
good
overall
i
would
prefer
this
one
on
tap
this
is
a
lemony
beer
that
drinks

i
could
see
having
a

of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
pleasantly
surprised
the
hint
of
lemon
adds
a
nice
touch
to
this
wellbalanced
sweet
beer
colors
vary
from
a
yellow
wheat
to
a
brownish
yellow
throughout
the
beer
perfect
for
a
nice
evening
outdoors
in
kc
mo
hoping
it
comes
to
the
east
coast
o
solid
example
of
the
style
the
nose
is
the
best
part
the
rest
is
good
just
not
quite
as
complex
sill
recommended
to
try
o
might
try
it
again
on
a
warm
summer
day
i
think
its
funny
how
this
site
has
changed
its
rating
system
like
4
or
5
times
in
the
last
year
anyways
this
beer
is
solid
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
this
great
brewery
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
small
amount
of
head
deep
gold
colored
with
flecks
expected
from
an
unfiltered
wheat
aroma
is
a
citrusy
bread
they
added
yeast
before
bottling
to
create
a
secondary
fermentation
and
you
can
tell
by
smell
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
a
little
thin
drinks
like
water
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
if
in
the
mood
for
a
wheat
beer
not
that
its
awful
just
a
lot
better
available
in
price
range
drinkable
but
nothing
terribly
special
would
have
expected
more
from

something
about
this
brew
makes
me
happy
every
time
i
taste
it
would
recommend
everyone
try
it
low
b
when
people
ask
me
how
i
got
so
cool
i
tell
them
that
ive
been
developing
this
yogurt
for
many
years
and
it
has
become
a
tasty
item
in
my
fridge
such
a
good

pours

very
carbonated
orange

taste

with
slight
bitterness
and
a
mildly
spicy
orange
peel
taste
at
the
end
aftertaste
is
mild
decent
beer
very
drinkable
but
certainly
not
the
best
of
the
bunch
o
this
is
a
shockingly
bland
offering
from
boulevard
not
without
its
good
points
but
it
fails
in
the
flavor
department
cloudy
yellow
body
with
an
inch

wheat
grain
malty
aroma
slightly
sweet
bready
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
hint
of
banana
too
grainy
but
still
drinkable
average
very
standard
if
i
thought
about
the
typical
flavors
and
aroma
of
an
american
wheat
it
would
be
just
like
this
maybe
even
more
standard
than
sam
summer
which
was
my
until
now
platonic
amwheat
ideal
very
good
nice
kc
flavor
not
bad
but
doesnt
stand
out
a
whole
lot
see
it
buy
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
if
ever
drank
o
could
certainly
drink
many
but
short
on
complex
taste
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
this
style
12
oz
bottle
from
variety
pack
pours
hazy
golden
with
tall
long
lasting
fluffy
white
head
nice
lacing
and
lovely
carbonation
aroma
is
of
yeast
wheat
malt
spices
and
ripe
apples
body
is
medium
and
smooth
wheat
malt
yeast
ripe
fruit
and
spices
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
long
and
spicy
quite
good
for
a
wheat
beer
the
usual
disclaimer
applies
here
im
not
a
wheat
beer
guy
but
this
one
is
a
huge
seller
so
i
figured
id
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
yeah
its
pretty
good
for
the
style
and
i
could
see
why
most
of
kansas
city
cools
off
with
this
in
the
summertime
o
i
was
expecting
more
after
hearing
good
thing
about
boulevard
wheat
while
it
is
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
it
is
definetly
average
at
best
very
refreshing
i
always
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
or
around
a
fire
in
the
evening
take
my
advice
and
serve
this
one
in
a
chilled
glass
easy
to
drink
crisply
satisfying
wheat
beer
that
ranks
as
one
of
my
favs
perfect
for
summer
but
drinkable
all
year
long
with
the
extra
body
lent
by
the
wheat
content
overall
this
is
an
excellent
wheat
beer
i
frequently
order
this
beer
with
food
this
style
has
broad
appeal
so
you
could
serve
to
large
number
of
guests
and
would
be
a
safe
choice
this
is
an
excellent
brewer
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
beers
from
them
o
its
good
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
just
with
the
flavors
were
more
pronounced
balance
mouthfeel
good
at
at
royals
game
one
tap
wheat
first
off
i
am
not
a
wheat
beer
guy
so
this
review
will
be
lacking
pours
a
golden
haze
as
an
unfiltered
beer
should
aroma
of
sweet
fruit
perhaps
fig
or
apricot
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
undesirable
for
me
but
in
the
realm
of
wheat
beer
in
the
higher
levels
of
wheat
beer
good
for
the
genre
pours
a
hazy
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
settles
down
to
just
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
and
sides
of
the
glass
some
streaky
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
grains
and
yeast
the
taste
is
the
same
with
a
hint
of
light
spice
as
well
clean
and
crisp
and
goes
down
easy
no
harsh
or
bitterness
at
all
great
anytime
of
the
year
and
one
of
my
favorite
wheats
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
an
unpleasant
finish
and
too
much
sweetness
detract
heavily
this
is
a
step
up
from
a
beer
like
blue
moon
but
a
step
below
or
two
from
other
craft
wheat
ales

abv
this
is
session
material
this
is
easily
a
goto
if
you
are
in
a
rush
and
dont
have
time
to
mull
options
if
you
are
saving
a
pal
from
the
watery
american
lager
style
this
is
a
good
starter
as
well
overall
boulevard
has
produced
another
hit
poured
from
the
aluminum
pint
bottle
into
a
goblet
watery
airy
head
quickly
goes
away
leaving
a
fizzy
bulb
of
cloudy
slightly
grainy
beer
that
resembles
thera
flu
tangy
lemony
aroma
flavor
is
just
not
really
there
for
me
i
get
some
sweetness
and
some
yeast
and
lemon
but
overall
this
really
hangs
back
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
satisfying
i
feel
like
theres
just
some
flavor
there
that
i
am
not
getting
i
am
a
fan
of
hefeweizen
in
general
but
id
handily
take
a
paulaner
or
white
rascal
over
this
this
tastes
like
a
fullerbodied
blue
moon
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
one
thisd
be
great
on
a
hot
day
or
to
take
camping
or
boating
this
would
also
probably
greatly
benefit
from
a
lemon
or
orange
wedge
but
ive
already
drank
most
of
it
so
screw
it
decent
but
there
are
a
number
of
widely
available
wheats
in
the
same
price
point
that
i
would
rather
buy
decent
well
balanced
wheat
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
what
it
does
it
does
well
at
4

abv
this
is
an
easy
drinking
session
that
would
be

cheers
enjoy
i
love
lucky

wheat
enjoy
some
of
the
older
brewery
german
wheat
beer
but
am
leaning
now
toward
boulevard
overall
good
price
point
so
if
you
enjoy
a
wheat
beer
this
is
worth
a
look
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
prickly
the
finish
is
slightly
dry

orange
in
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
little
retention
definitely
looks
unfiltered
as
there
is
no
translucency
smell
is
pretty
malt
forward
definitely
sweet
caramel
and
almost
a
little
lemon
in
the
smell
taste
is
definitely
some
nice
caramel
malt
with
a
little
hint
of
belgian
yeast
which
i
think
is
quite
tasty
there
is
definitely
a
little
bananaclove
taste
from
the
yeast
that
really
works
well
not
really
much
flavor
from
any
hops
which
seems
really
appropriate
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
as
here
isnt
too
much
carbonation
in
the
beer
overall
a
fairly
nice
tasting
beer
not
anything
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
like
some
of
the
better
boulevard
beers
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
m
body
is
mild

medium

i
see
good
carbonation
bubbles
i
get
a
whiff
of
pale
wheat
and
telltale
american
wheat
yeast
that
gives
it
a
bit
of
an
orange
like
aroma
light
in
body
with
a
light
bitterness
from
the
yeast
from
a
slight

the
pale

is
a
soft
contrast
to
that

overall
wheat
is
up
front
and
is
close
enough
to
big
american
lager
to
serve
as
a
good
gateway
for
craft
newbies
very
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
brew
for
anytime
but
mostly
a
summer
beer
classic
standard
wheat
beer
done
right
it
has
a
cloudy
golden
complexion
though
you
can
still
see
through
it
its
definitely
on
the
malty
side
and
has
a
pleasant
aftertaste
that
is
almost
fruity
or
lemony
though
excellently
subtle
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
pours
a
hazy
color
with
a
two
finger
head
thw
smell
is
a
pretty
standard
beer
smell
its
got
a
great
flavor
while
still
being
very
drinkable
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
is
trying
to
transition
from
a
bmc
background
into
craft
beer
o
my
review
would
probably
be
different
if
i
had
this
on
an
outdoor
patio
in
june
or
july
unfortunately
i
had
it
in
a
cool
restaurant
while
watching
playoff
baseball
on
tv
after
dinner
seems
like
it
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
for
me
fantastic
wheat
beer
has
a
great
cloudy
look
for
a
wheat
and
tastes
incredibly
fresh
pours
with
a
huge
four
finger
head
and
has
a
great
odor
very
easy
drinking
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
leaves
the
palate
feeling
clean
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
not
a
great
beer
for
the
time
of
year
but
something
i
could
enjoy
a
lot
over
the
summer
o
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
really
good
certainly
not
bad
nothing
really
pops
on
this
one
probably
the
biggest
drawback
is
i
was
drinking
ayinger
brauweiss
last
night
and
compared
to
that
this
is
swill
but
compared
to
say
bud
light
this
would
be
great
if
that
makes
any
sense
not
my
favorite
from
boulevard
overall
a
mellow
unambitious
wheat
theres
no
mistaking
this
for
a
hefeweizen
its
your
basic
nofrills
american
wheat
there
are
better
options
a
pretty
standard
clean
american
wheat
beer
suits
in
a
pinch
or
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summers
day
but
mostly
something
that
i
dont
found
overly
interesting
o
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
it
would
be
a
great
beer
for
enjoying
during
the
summer
on
a
boat
the
boulevard
wheat
ale
can
best
be
described
as
a
fauxhefeweizen
while
it
does
have
a
nice
wheat
flavor
and
mouth
feel
it
somehow
feels
lacking
compared
to
other
wheat
beers
that
ive
tried
its
somewhat
bland
but
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
bad
wheat
beers
like
this
are
good
companions
to
spicy
food
while
its
not
for
me
i
imagine
that
under
the
right
circumstances
this
or
the
schlafly
hefeweizen
could
be
a
religious
experience
to
a
missouri
beer
drinker
with
a
tongue
for
unfiltered
wheat
beers
who
only
previously
drank
piss
water
like
bud
or
natty
light
give
it
a
try
if
youve
been
drinking
nothing
but
lagers
overall
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
from
boulevard
boss
toms
golden
bock
is
their
best
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
a
straight
up
simple
and
unoffensive
wheat
ale
that
would
appeal
nicely
to
non
craft
drinkers
but
is
pretty
light
overall
not
bad
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
elsewhere
overall
exactly
what
it
promised
to
be
slightly
more
tart
than
expected
but
not
unpleasant
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
check
it
out
if
you
dont
particularly
like
wheat
beers
this
wont
change
your
mind
o
goes
down
very
nicely
but
overall
unimpressive
had
in
nonic
pint
glass
on
my
recliner
starts
like
liquid
bread
and
smells
as
such
then
later
lemony
citrusy
flavors
kick
in
just
a
small
hop
presence
but
still
well
balanced
i
think
a
small
squeeze
of
lemon
really
enhances
the
flavor
a
refreshing
brew
for
summer
and
all
other
seasons
unfiltered
wheat
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
large
long
lasting
white
lacing
head
their
really
isnt
much
of
an
aroma
very
weak
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
more
mellow
flavor
with
nice
hints
of
citrus
and
a
creamy
wheat
undertone
very
crisp
very
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
overall
a
nice
wheat
beer
an
excellent
example
of
this
great
summerperfect
beer
style
clean
and
wheaty
not
the
most
exciting
beer
in
the
world
but
a
good
summer
beer
or
a
nice
light
beer
alternative
highly
recommend
o
good
abv

one
would
think
rahr
could
slip
something
competitive
in
there
unfortunately
this

overall
this
is
a
pleasant
drinking
light
beer
not
super
big
or
flavorful
but
certainly
pleasant
and
within
the
style
certainly
easy
to
drink
large
amounts
on
a
hot
summer
day
oa
boring
bland
beer
would
not
consider
it
a
pale

ale
as
it
lacks
any

pours
yellow
into
the
glass
with
a
bit
of
head
that
disappates

no

and
the
head
has
completely
disappeared

nice
unfiltered
look
as
expected

on
the
nose
with
not
much
else
going
on
flavor
is
good
again
wheat
dominating
with
a
hint
of
citrus
clean
drinking
nothing
special
but
not
unenjoyable
by
any
means
overall
a
really
easy
session
beer
good
anytime
but
better
in
the
summer
o
still
new
to
this
style
but
i
give
this
beer
credit
for
offering
hope
of
the
existence
of
a
hefeweizen
which
i
may
someday
truly
admire
all
in
all
not
bad
just
not
great
half
finger
head
with
good
retention
on
a
cloudy
pale
gold
body
aroma
is
simple
mostly
wheat
some
pale
malts
and
generic
herbs
flavor
is
a
little
dull
and
simple
with
some
light
lemon
custard
citrus
wheat
light
grains
best
part
of
this
one
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
creamy
and
smooth
with
moderate
carbonation
highly
drinkable
but
not
very
flavorful
or
memorable
o
a
good
solid
wheat
beer
very
drinkable
would
be
good
with
a
spicy
meal
because
it
goes
down
fast
and
easy
great
flavor
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
it
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
when
you
just
want
to
pound
a
beer
the
flavor
is
fleeting
and
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
crisp
there
just
isnt
much
here
ill
definitely
be
avoiding
this
in
the
future
overall
i
really
like
wheat
type
beers
and
this
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
i
have
had
this
beer
before
but
i
am
reviewing
this
while
drinking
it
i
live
maybe
30
min
from
the
brewery
so
i
can
usually
get
this
beer
fairly
fresh
it
is
not
very
bitter
and
the
strong
citrus
gives
it
a
really
refreshing
taste
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
and
goes
very
well
with
grilled
fish
in
my
opinion
the
wheat
gets
played
down
a
bit
in
the
taste
but
the
citrus
is
still
solid
and
flavorful
along
with
a
mild
dry
finish
i
would
like
to
try
one
again
that
is
fresh
o
not
my
favorite
style
and
probably
the
most
cloudy
unfiltered
beer
i
ever
drank
2
955
00
o
very
drinkable
beer
has
been
my
spring
and
summer
goto
beer
for
years
unfiltered
wheat
was
actually
the
first
bottle
of
beer
i
had
i
think
this
has
been
consistently
one
of
the
best
beers
boulevard
has
made
overall
3
5
good
wheat
beer
that
would
be
a
really
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
light
and
bubbly
and
would
be
perfect
for
the
summer
o
a
pretty
good
american
pale
wheat
ale
nothing
special
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
o
im
dissapointed
that
i
dirtied
up
a
weizen
glass
for
this
it
looks
like
a
wheat
beer
but
that
is
where
it
stops
i
bought
this
in
date
bbd
12312
but
drank
it
a
little
late
i
may
seek
out
a
younger
bottle
to
see
if
my
opinion
changes
surely
seven
days
wouldnt
make
it
this
bad
though
o
moderate
tasting
somewhat
thin
wheat
beer
with
some
decent
if
underwhelming
flavors
overall
fairly
mild
easy
to
drink
but
not
something
to
have
if
seeking
bold
flavors
o
not
bad
just
bland
its
refreshing
finish
and
top
notch
drinkability
gives
it
a
few
brownie
points
it
doesnt
measure
up
to
a
good
hefeweizen
though
o
its
a
very
simple
beer
but
its
pleasant
enough
nothing
to
think
about
here
just
a
nofrills
easy
drinking
american
wheat
it
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
poured
into
a
snifter
seems
highly
carbonated
faint
smells
of
straw
and
grassy
notes
with
hints
of
lemon
i
am
not
detecting
any
banana
or
clove
notes
in
this
beer
i
assuming
because
this
is
an
american
wheat
beer
and
most
likely
the
yeast
they
use
is
not
the
same
as
bavarian
yeast
lacing
is
acute
and
dwindles
away
a
very
simplistic
wheat
beer
with
very
little
or
any
unique
qualities
the
head
is
solid
white
and
dissipates
quickly
a
good
amount
of
yeast
floats
about
in
this
beer
and
settles
with
time
not
the
best
wheat
beer
by
far
but
i
have
to
admit
its
easy
to
drink
and
sure
offers
a
lot
more
then
the
domestics
to
be
found
liquid
white
bread
anyone
reminds
me
of
wonder
bread
oddly
d
it
is
a
golden
straw
yellow
with
some
haziness
to
it
and
no
signs
of
carbonation
too
no
head
of
foam
too
it
smells
like
bready
and
sweet
malts
taste
is
along
the
same
idea
too
pretty
straightforward
wheat
with
mild
hop
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
of
the
is
smooth
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
a
bit
chewy
this
beer
overall
is
a
standard
wheat
beer
not
much
going
on
and
pretty
basic
had
on
tap
at
the
corner
slice
in
greensboro
over
the
weekend
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
hazy
lemony
yellow
color
with
a
thinner
nicely
formed
white
head
aromas
of
faint
toasted
wheat
and
spice
mainlynot
much
there
really
flavors
are
light
but
pretty
refreshing
with
lemon
and
toasted
creallike
flavorsagain
light
but
goes
down
easy
a
pretty
standard
wheat
ale
but
its
better
than
alot
out
there
of
the
same
ilk
o
decent
brew
but
not
great
id
drink
it
again
if
it
was
the
best
beer
available
its
super
simple
and
really
forgettable
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
o
id
have
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
kill
for
it
really
pretty
standard
as
other
reviewers
seem
to
agree
wheat
and
lemon
0
a
moderately
good
wheat
ale
overall
nothing
overly
complex
but
a
good
sessionable
light
beer
i
will
pick
this
up
again
perfect
for
a
hot
summers
afternoon
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
rather
sessionable
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
super
simple
as
you
would
probably
expect
very
light
aroma
and
flavors
tasty
enough
and
very
sessionable
for
sure
dont
let
the
poor
numbers
phase
you
its
just
because
its
such
a
light
beer
there
is
nothing
bad
about
it
at
all
o
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
is
a
nice
easy
beer
for
the
hot
summer
overall
this
wheat
is
a
refreshing
brew
perfect
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
reminiscent
of
a
german
hefeweizen
this
pale
wheat
ale
would
pair
well
with
farmers
cheese
and
grilled
meats

a

so
they
are
relying

on
the
malt

and
the
fermentation
here
boulevard
nails
the
style
o
i
think
this
is
an
above
average
take
on
a
wheat
more
flavor
and
body
than
some
summer
beers
overall
not
bad
not
great
either
but
very
sufficient
as
a
more
flavorablethanaverage
session
beer
o
this
beer
gets
some
crap
from
craft
drinkers
but
it
is
what
it
is
a
refreshing
american
wheat
beer
and
it
doesnt
hurt
that
this
ist
he
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
this
is
my
favorite
beer
i
love
the
weight
of
the
beer
and
the
murky
color
it
has
lighter
notes
but
not
so
much
that
you
think
of
it
as
it
fruity
beer
though
some
with
serve
this
with
a
citrus
slice
the
sunniness
of
this
beer
allows
it
to
stand
alone
best
when
served
in
a
glass
as
most
beers
are
but
very
manageable
in
a
bottle
overall
a
real
enjoyable
and
solid
wheat
ale
going
to
enjoy
finishing
this
six
pack
at
4
4abv
boulevards
unfiltered
wheat
is
drinkable
with
an
ability
to
be
quite
sessionable
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
introduce
friends
and
family
into
craft
beer
culture
however
the
uneventful
taste
and
weak
aroma
didnt
endear
itself
to
me
although
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
offering
there
are
many
other
wheat
beers
on
the
market
that
i
would
reach
for
first
final
thoughts
the
bottle
i
had
was
expired
by
over
a
month
however
i
dont
think
that
a
fresh
bottle
could
have
improved
the
taste
too
much
as
far
as
wheat
beers
go
there
are
definitely
some
better
options
out
there
overall
a
solid
brew
widely
available
option
to
the
macros
which
is
good
basically
the
wheat
version
of
snpa
presentation
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
wheat
beer
glass
really
nice
straw
yellow
appearance
with
a
bountiful
head
and
tons
of
lacing
the
smell
is
yeast
bread
an
initial
hit
of
clove
and
a
touch
of
lemon
with
some
hop
finish
this
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
its
taste
is
lacking
some
body
overall
its
taste
is
very
much
like
a
simple
bread
but
it
lacks
some
character
while
this
wont
fill
you
up
on
a
hot
day
its
going
to
leave
you
feeling
a
bit
empty
in
a
different
way
that
initial
hint
of
clove
dissipates
and
there
is
no
bannana
flavor
found
in
beers
of
a
similar
style
its
got
a
nice
hazy
appearance
that
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
smooth
and
dry
mouthfeel
incredibly
drinkable
with
mild
citrus
notes
and
a
good
wheat
presence
seriously
at
4
6
its
got
enough
flavor
to
be
interesting
but
is
so
easy
drinking
this
is
a
summer
session
beer
for
sure
what
else
do
you
want
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
lemon
and
wheat
taste
is
the
same
a
wheat
tang
some
lemon
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
a
good
warm
weather
beer
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
bright
cloudy
glow
in
the
dark
yellow
seriously
hazy
appearance
smells
so
subtle
wheat
and
not
much
else
flavor
is
not
bad
just
so
subtle
and
almost
watery
i
could
probably
pound
this
all
day
long
but
im
not
sure
id
want
to
it
seriously
had
so
little
flavor
i
guess
you
could
call
it
beer
o
a
decent
wheat
ale
nothing
spectacular
and
lacking
in
several
areas
o
a
great
start
for
people
looking
to
get
into
craft
beer
its
easily
available
on
draft
and
bottle
a
great
session
beer
note
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
in
expecting
a
wheat
i
was
a
little
bit
disappointed
o
good
not
great
would
certainly
brab
one
at
or
brin
some
to
a
party
but
might
not
buy
for
self
oeasy
to
drink
wheat
beer
light
in
flavor
more
tart
than
most
not
my
favorite
of
the
wheats
overall
there
is
not
much
to
this
beer
and
i
cannot
say
i
am
either
impressed
or
disappointed
by
how
it
tastes
you
will
not
miss
much
if
you
skip
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
and
a
bunch
of
yeast
floating
up
and
down
aromas
are
muted
definite
wheat
with
not
too
much
else
wheat
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
along
with
some
light
yeast
character
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
had
some
banana
flavour
but
it
never
came
back
sadly
crisp
and
strongly
carbonated
a
good
low
hopped
classic
american
wheat
without
any
major
flaws
a
definite
summer
drinker
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
moderate
for
the
style
overall
it
was
a
pretty
nice
flavored
easy
drinking
beer
pretty
clean
and
refreshing
and
decent
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
pleasant
and
muted
nonoffensive
it
has
a
nice
wheaty
taste
with
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
many
people
add
a
lemon
to
this
beer
to
add
more
citrus
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
for
a
wheat
beer
and
easydrinking
overall
a
good
beer
that
sometimes
gets
overlooked
because
it
truly
is
everywhere
in
the
midwest
hey
it
beats
a
macro
cloudy
yellow
in
color
forms
a
large
fizzy
white
head
little
retention
no
lacing
smell
is
mostly
of
brad
and
wheat
with
some
light
notes
of
banana
ans
spice
flavor
is
similar
but
very
light
lots
of
wheat
and
a
light
tartness
but
little
else
light
bodied
simplistic
but
an
easy
drinker
cloudy
body
similar
to
a
well
built
ipa
nice
2
finger
head
which
dissapeared
rather
quickly
smells
of
wheat
what
and
wheat
maybe
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
and
a
touch
of
orange
taste
same
as
smell
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
at
all
if
youre
a
hop
head
this
isnt
for
you
refreshing
and
crisp
but
not
much
more
mouthfeeloverall
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
fairly
smooth
overall
this
is
definitely
not
the
best
wheat
beer
out
there
but
its
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
just
about
defines
average
for
me
for
the
wheat
beer
style
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
and
not
something
i
mind
revisiting
from
time

taste
is
sharp
melding
the
wheat
and
yeast
with
some
citrus
tones
not
an
overly
complex
wheat
beer
but
quite
enjoyable
and
sessionworthy
nonetheless

very
light
and
easy
to

the
taste
follows
suit
with
a

of
sourness
on
the
fringe
of
the
flavor
not
a
big
fan
the
taste
is
almost
nonexistent

overall
this
is
barely
a
step
up
from
the
macro
bmcs
of
the
world
not
worth
drinking
unless
theres
nothing
else
available
overall
a
decent
beer
at
best
there
is
100
different
beers
of
the
style
that
are
better
i
havent
bought
this
beer
in
years
this
one
was
part
of
a
round
not
purchased
by
me
probably
wont
buy
it
but
that
doesnt
necessarily
mean
its
bad
its
a
great
transition
beer
for
swill
drinkers
rarely
do
i
ever
seek
out
this
sort
of
beer
but
this
came
in
a
sampler
pack
i
helped
to
kill
and
i
was
quite
impressed
with
it
very
delicate
but
wonderfully
quenching
a
bit
more
flavor
would
have
been
nice
but
id
rather
have
this
than
an
overthetop
banana
bomb
of
a
wheat
brew
appearance
is
cloudy
gold
and
it
should
be
it
is
an
unfiltered
wheat
ale
smell
is
very
nicely
hopped
and
has
the
right
citus
aromas
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
disappointing
lingers
somewhat
to
long
taste
this
is
a
nice
wheat
that
will
compete
with
the
more
popular
brands
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
one
we
will
enjoy
but
not
deploy
often
good
with
all
types
of
bar
food
overall
an
average
because
someone
could
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
it
was
just
too
mild
for
me
but
it
was
not
bad
tasting
or
smelling
looks
like
a
standard
wheat
beer
with
a
few
floating
yeast
bits
and
an
excited
head
something
was
off
with
the
aroma
though
a
tartness
of
overripe
fruit
maybe
almost
vinegary
in
the
nose
maybe
not
quite
but
something
a
bit
unpleasant
was
there
for
sure
tasted
better
than
it
smelled
as
the
intense
carbonation
highlighted
some
of
the
more
subtle
grassy
flavors
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
but
i
likely
wont
buy
this
again
i
reckon
it
missed
the
mark
a
bit
here
boulevard
usually
makes
very
good
beer
this
must
be
a
great
summer
beer
drinking
it
on
a
cool
fall
night
its
still
pretty
good
overall
disappointing
but
im
used
to
that
with
this
style
with
the
notable
exceptions
of
gumballhead
a
lil
sumpin
and
a
few
more
brews
american
pale
wheats
are
an
uninspired
bunch
this
beer
is
no
different
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
it
was
pretty
nice
so
crisp
i
could
see
it
being
a
decent
session
beer
the
mouthfeel
has
medium
carbination
and
a
medium
viscosity

last
beer
of
the
night
is

my

the

in

tulip
glass
decent
carbonation
forms
a
nice
white

that

is

this
is
a
great
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
wheat
beer
the
nose
and
taste
are
well
done
the
appearance
is
nice
for
the
style
the
area
that
could
be
improved
the
most
is

even
compared
to
other
massmarket
wheat
beers
overall
drinkability
refreshing
flavorless
the
bud
light
of
wheat
beers
almost
all
of
the
points
im
awarding
this
beer
for
the
overall
score
have
to
do
with
its
refreshment
factor
and
for
nothing
else
o
dont
drink
it
unless
youre
ticking
overall
once
again
its
offensive
because
it
takes
no
risks
and
intends
not
to
offend
anyone
in
kansas
and
missouri
this
is
a
big
seller
i
am
told
i
can
see
why
however
boulevard
is
much
better
than
this
beer
dont
let
this
one
fool
you
boulevard
is
a
killer
brewery
its
just
that
it
seems
that
most
breweries
have
to
make
their
unoffensive
mainstream
brew
in
order
to
pay
for
them
being
able
to
make
masterpieces
like
brett
and
tank
7
ordered
this
beer
tonight
at
a
local
cajan
restaurant
it
was
listed
only
as
boulevard
the
server
said
he
thought
it
was
a
lager
what
showed
up
was
a
pint
glass
with
a
cloudy
golden
colored
brew
typical
of
a
weizenbier
after
checking
with
the
bar
i
discovered
it
was
in
fact
the
boulevard
unfiltered
wheat
beer
as
a
wheat
beer
this
was
at
best
unremarkable
but
drinkable
it
tasted
like
a
light
beer
with
hardly
any
alcohol
and
had
a
slight
wheat
flavor
with
an
early
hint
of
citrus
overall
it
was
pretty
bland
but
a
good
thirst
quencher
i
picked
up
a
boulevard
mixed
twelve
pack
last
week
at
argonaut
this
was
one
of
the
included
beers
and
it
proved
quite
refreshing
on
a
late
summer
evening
poured
a
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
solid
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
and
toasted
malts
on
the
palate
light
bodied
and
refreshing
with
flavors
of
wheat
and
toasted
malt
overall
not
impressed
this
is
a
pretty
weak
offering
from
boulevard
really
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
though
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
i
expected
a
little
more
from
boulevard
but
they
did
make
a
light
bodied
wheat
beer
you
can
drink
a
few
of
and
not
get
a
heavy
wheat
settling
at
about
2
a
piece
which
i
think
is
mostly
for
the
cost
of
the
aluminum
bottle
its
kind
of
pricey
for
what
you
get
d
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
dinner
went
well
with
grilled
chicken

a

nearly
opaque
honey
yellow
the
way
i
poured
it
i
did
not
get
much
head
but
that
could
be
my
fault
aroma
is
wheaty
and
yeasty
with
just
a
hint
of
fruit
about
average
but
still
appealing
flavor
is
typical
of
a
good
wheat
beer
wheaty
yeasty
subtly
fruity
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
fizzy
with
some
good
body
a
good
summer
beer
o
well
this
brew
was
definitely
more
exciting
when
i
didnt
know
what
else
the
world
of
craft
beer
had
to
offer
it
is
highly
drinkable
however
it
comes
off
as
pretty
bland
overall
its
ok
just
ok
overall
a
good
well
balanced
summertime
wheat
best
part
i
got
to
enjoy
these
pool
side
in
relax
mode
starting
my
way
through
the
current
sampler
box
right
here
it
pours
a
pretty
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
black
pepper
rock
salt
and
a
touch
of
honey
lemme
see
if
i
can
properly
put
my
impression
of
this
smell
into
words
its
refreshing
and
pleasant
but
also
unexpected
which
is
slightly
offputting
god
i
hope
that
makes
some
sense
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
light
lemon
zest
light
black
pepper
a
pinch
of
salt
and
a
decidedly
light
undercurrent
of
caramel
beneath
it
all
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
slightly
grainy
feel
overall
an
okay
wheat
beer
but
the
bit
of
salty
character
which
i
normally
welcome
seems
very
outofplace
and
everything
else
is
just
kinda
bland
and
boring
not
a
bad
thirstquencher
though
the
beer
was
a
nice
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
hay
grass
lemon
and
yeast
it
tastes
similar
but
a
bit
tart
with
wheat
lemon
and
bread
its
light
with
prickly
carbonation
and
a
has
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
just
a
well
made
wheat
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
d
this
is
a
great
wheat
beer
that
is
subdued
but
well
crafted
i
absolutely
love
this
brew
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
crisp
tasty
and
refreshing
o
not
impressed
should
have
picked
one
of
the
major
label
amderican
brews
overall
decently
in
the
session
range
for
a
brew
like
the
lemongrass
and
carbonation
tinge
quite
a
bit
tends
to
sell
out
at
the
local
fred
meyer
regularly
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
would
drink
again
overallunderwhelmed
i
may
just
give
up
trying
wheat
beers
overall
o
pretty
decent
beer
nice
for
a
session
or
the
summer
while
there
wasnt
anything
necessarily
unpleasant
it
was
just
a
very
lackluster
beer
extremely
drinkablecould
have
these
on
the
porch
for
hours
on
a
hot
and
sticky
day
extremely
impressed
with
boulevard
for
making
a
great
but
light
craft
brew
ill
admit
im
not
the
biggest
wheat
beer
guy
but
this
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
extremely
drinkable
and
hit
the
spot
on
this
hot
summer
day
libation
a
light
drinkable
summer
brew
that
is
held
back
by
a
mild
sour
taste
its
decent
o
this
is
a
solid
summer
beer
refreshing
and
crisp
with
nice
flavor
the
aroma
was
relatively
weak
but
otherwise
a
solid
summer
wheat
beer
this
makes
for
a
good
warm
weather
beer
its
kind
of
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
low
but
that
just
means
you
can
drink
more
of
it
o
not
the
best
wheat
beer
by
a
longshot
but
pleasant
enough
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
after
mowing
the
lawn
i
appreciate
the
low
abv
honestly
with
summer
coming
i
would
buy
another
few
of
these
when
it
starts
getting
warmer
overall
drinkable
and
somewhat
refreshing
just
not
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
with
very
little
lingering
aftertaste
i
can
see
the
crossover
appeal
of
this
but
it
is
simply
lacking
in
pronounced
flavor
i
will
drink
my
other
bottle
from
the
sampler
pack
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
thereafter
overall
though
its
range
of
flavors
varied
i
would
consider
it
a
very
good
beer
for
lightly
flavored
foodwithout
the
headache
you
might
get
from
a
comparable
wine
or
malt
liquor
drink
and
without
the
overpowering
hopping
you
find
in
other
hefweissens
like
blue
moon
very
drinkable
just
not
really
sippable
to
style
but
not
bad
nor
good
this
is
a
very
good
light
and
quenching
summer
ale
it
is
not
very
complex
but
highly
drinkable
without
becoming
too
onedimensional
i
could
easily
drink
this
again
during
the
hot
summer
to
come
overall
this
is
a
great
wheat
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
but
still
manages
to
provide
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
complexity
a
wonderful
session
beer
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
o
a
decent
pale
wheat
ale
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
afternoon
the
taste
is
much
more
pronounced
a
mellow
blend
of
wheats
and
grains
and
funk
very
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
pretty
good
beer
overall
refreshing
but
not
overly
flavorful
o
kind
of
a
letdown
in
terms
of
the
beer
itself
but
the
bottle
is
the
highlight
here
d
drinks
fairly
well
but
it
most
definitely
on
the
boring
end
poured
this
beer
into
a
weizen
glass
slightly
hazy
golden
body
with
a
thin
white
head
some
solids
were
apparent
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
smell
is
of
light
wheat
and
citrus
taste
is
mostly
wheat
as
it
should
be
but
also
some
notes
of
citrus
and
slight
hops
are
also
present
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
but
not
bad
on
a
warm
day
it
would
likely
feel
just
right
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
representation
i
have
found
other
wheat
beers
that
i
enjoy
more
and
ill
stick
with
those
as
staple
items
drunkability
this
beer
is
damn
refreshing
it
may
be
knocked
for
its
simple
flavor
but
i
think
it
is
good
im
not
really
looking
for
conmplexity
in
a
wheat
beer
d
despite
the
low
marks
in
some
categories
i
find
this
beer
extremely
drinkablesessionable
a
great
flagship
brew
for
boulevard
overall
this
is
a
good
idiot
beer
a
total
no
thinker
to
to
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
however
if
consumed
on
a
hot
day
i
would
chill
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
since
the
body
is
a
little
heavy
o
i
can
see
why
this
is
their
most
popular
beer
and
it
is
good
for
the
style
however
the
word
sessionable
doesnt
come
to
mind
when
thinking
of
this
beer
overall
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
appearance
has
a
cloudy
straw
orange
color
with
a
thick
crisp
head
that
lingers
leaving
nill
lace
smell
of
weak
spice
citrus
and
yeast
taste
is
again
a
little
weak
with
the
malt
wheat
and
above
aromas
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
not
a
big
spike
of
carbonation
as
noticed
in
other
american
wheat
beers
a
mellow
non
complex
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
drink
good
palate
cleanser
after
dinner
before
the
dessert
had
because
the
company
paid
for
it
probably
wont
have
it
again
drinkability
one
of
my
favorite
wheats
good
easy
drinking
great
for
a
summer
day
a
staple
of
the
midwest
not
too
complex
but
very
smoothdrinking
tasty
and
balanced
refreshing
and
great
for
the
start
of
spring
poured
into
a
wheat
beer
glass
appearance
was
cloudy
golden
amber
gave
2
fingers
of
head
it
smelled
of
grains
wheat
and
hops
tasted
grainy
and
malty
with
nice
hop
balance
with
prevalence
of
of
wheat
coming
through
as
well
nice
medium
mouthfeel
hoppy
bitter
finish
overall
very
good
very
yeasty
and
refreshing
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
very
impressed
this
beer
was
served
on
tap
at
the
the
local
applebys
i
had
a
gift
card
to
use
people
i
asked
for
this
to
be
served
without
the
damn
lemon
the
beer
poured
nicely
created
a
1
finger
white
foamy
head
the
color
was
a
light
yellow
and
it
was
cloudy
hence
the
unfiltered
style
the
smell
was
only
average
it
was
very
yeasty
i
did
not
pick
up
much
citrus
or
hop
aroma
the
mouthfeel
was
average
slightly
watered
down
the
taste
was
average
this
is
a
great
starter
beer
for
trying
to
get
someone
out
of
the
american
light
lager
box
7
years
ago
i
would
have
loved
this
the
taste
is
not
bad
just
not
much
going
on
very
yeasty
slight
wheat
taste
no
hop
or
fruit
notes
to
speak
of
this
is
a
good
beer
i
think
it
would
be
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
good
session
beer
i
would
like
to
see
it
a
little
bit
dryer
and
be
more
crisp
i
am
drinking
this
past
suggested
date
so
a
fresher
example
could
be
better
sorry
for
the
anecdotes
but
this
beer
is
special
to
me
and
i
wanted
to
give
it
its
due
o
not
my
first
choice
but
far
from
my
last
a
good
representation
of
the
style
thank
you
boulevard
all
in
all
this
is
definitely
a
summer
beer
but
even
if
it
is
winter
time
i
will
never
turn
one
of
these
down
as
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
i
feel
bad
hitting
this
so
hard
since
it
is
a
flagship
beer
of
my
local
brewery
indeed
this
is
an
extremely
popular
craft
beer
among
bmc
drinkers
in
the
region
and
was
probably
the
first
nonbmc
beer
i
drank
with
any
regularity
it
fails
to
satisfy
now
that
ive
broadened
my
horizons
but
this
would
still
be
my
second
choice
behind
a
sam
adams
at
many
local
restaurants
it
would
also
have
its
place
as
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
at
the
ballpark
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
decent
level
of
carbonation
not
over
the
top
all
in
all
an
average
offering
for
this
genre
overall
i
cant
say
that
its
the
worst
beer
ive
had
but
it
isnt
a
very
good
wheat
its
not
the
only
reason
i
reviewed
it
online
but
id
already
written
this
out
in
my
personal
reviews
i
saw
how
high
of
marks
it
had
received
here
and
sought
to
offer
a
differing
viewpoint
i
like
wheat
beer
a
lot
i
just
dont
like
this
one
a
good
session
beer
nothing
to
blow
you
away
but
i
could
drink
plenty
of
them
12
oz
single
looks
like
there
is
quite
some
sediment
in
this
baby
so
i
took
the
old
school
precaution
of
rolling
the
bottle
before
pouring
attractive
bright
sunny
yellow
beer
with
a
lovelly
large
whitefluffy
head
aroma
is
pretty
subdued
none
of
the
esters
etc
that
one
comes
to
expect
from
the
style
some
slight
hay
and
a
wiff
of
cheese
taste
is
sweet
ripened
banana
some
bubble
gum
wheat
bread
and
candy
sugar
overall
pretty
tasty
nice
spritzy
palate
on
this
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
good
one
for
the
summer

it
is
a

bright

with
lots
of
fizz
that
builds
up
a
crackly
white

leaves
light

the
yeast
makes
it
opaque
and
pushes
it
into
yellow
territory
light
but
pleasant
aroma
contributes
yeast
wheat
and
a
few
esters
the
flavor
is
very
light
as
well
almost
thin
but
there
are
notes
of
lemon
toasty
crackers
wheat
nutty
yeast
grasshay
and
a
lightly
spicy
fruitiness
there
is
almost
no
bitterness
and
the
ph
is
a
touch
lower
than
expected
but
it
makes
for
a
nice
flavorbooster
it
has
a
very
light
and
tingly
body
and
as
the
carbonation
subsides
the
flavor
grows
very
refreshing
and
an
easy
session
brew
a
solid
example
of
the
style

this
is
a
clean
wellmade
approachable
beer
that
would
be
good
training
wheels
for
a
noncraft
beer
drinker
however
i
dont
find
enough
flavor
or
complexity
to
consider
it
a
great
beer
summary
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
have
had
many
a
time
not
the
most
interesting
but
better
than
alot
you
can
put
down
a
lot
of
these
in
a
night
d
the
grassiness
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
with
this
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
but
it
does
not
stand
out
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
that
would
go
well
with
food
or
even
without
from
notes
tasted
april
2010
i
think
that
this
beer
is
outstanding
it
may
not
be
the
beer
that
jumps
out
and
grabs
you
but
it
is
the
beer
that
stocks
my
fridge
simple
great
taste
for
a
great
price
great
beer
to
pair
with
that
famous
kc
bbq
or
just
to
take
to
the
lake
and
kick
back
i
love
this
beer
great
beer
boulevard

i
liked
this
beer

would
definitely
drink
more

by

it
remind
me
a
bit
of
widmers
hefe
its
cleaner
that
a
german
wheat
beer
but
theres
still
a
bit
of
lemon
and
a
hint
of
spice
theres
a
sweet
wheat
malt
taste
with
a
bit
of
cracker
and
toast
crust
im
left
with
a
bready
taste
and
light
lemon
drop
note
all
in
all
a
good
take
on
the
style
price
is
usually
pretty
decent
for
boulevard
stuff
that
makes
this
a
recommend
in
my
book
so
long
as
you
actually
like
some
wheat
beers
out
there
overalldrinkability
i
have
had
some
versions
of
kölsch
and
american
hefeweizens
but
this
one
seemed
to
stand
out
above
a
good
many
of
them
overall
refreshing
and
incredibly
drinkable
in
my
opinion
why
while
away
a
hot
summer
day
with
bmc
when
you
could
sip
this
stuff
instead
d
this
is
one
of
boulevards
better
beers
in
my
opinion
not
overwhelmingly
exciting
but
fits
the
style
well
and
is
refreshing
cloudy
yellow
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
head
that
had
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
looks
like
a
hefewiezen
but
that
is
where
the
similarities
end
slight
lemon
zest
aroma
with
wheat
malt
providing
the
foundation
wheat
flavor
with
some
lemon
wheat
beers
are
pretty
boring
without
hefe
yeast
or
abundant
american
hops
and
this
has
neither
light
body
with
good
carbonation
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
approachable
and
inoffensive
for
the
masses
just
hohum
for
beer
drinkers
expecting
a
little
more
from
their
beer
overall
i
would
like
to
give
this
another
try
when
the
beer
is
a
lot
fresher
and
for
my
pretty
much
first
beer
of
this
style
it
was
not
so
bad
d
i
have
had
this
beer
more
times
than
i
can
remember
i
was
pretty
shocked
when
i
saw
that
i
hadnt
reviewed
this
yet
as
far
as
apwas
go
this
is
a
decent
one
that
is
worth
trying
ill
continue
to
drink
this
as
it
is
all
over
st
louis
on
tap
this
is
a
beer
that
im
actually
not
sure
ive
ever
had
before
and
ive
discounted
it
because
of
its
proliferation
in
this
area
of
the
country
a
lesson
in
the
weakness
of
assumptions
this
should
be
classified
as
a
hefeweizen
it
is
a
good
american
version
of
such
t
taste
isnt
bad
either
but
its
not
special
it
drinks
easy
and
is
nice
and
crisp
and
refreshing

this
beer
is
beautiful
in
its
simplicity
its
singleminded
and
that

tasty

beer
is

apologies
for
reviewing
this
beer
relative
to
a
hefe
standard
but
that
was
how
the
beer
was
introduced
to
me
regardless
of
the
categorization
the
lack
of
flavornosebody
was
overwhelming
thanks
to
alewatcher
for
pointing
that
out
to
me
personally
d
this
beer
is
alright
in
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
make
you
think
very
refreshing
beer
for
the
summertime
nothing
much
else
going
for
this
beer
a
good
gateway
beer
for
the
craft
world
well
put
together
but
nothing
stands
out
with
it
a
good
blend
of
sweet
sugar
wheat
and
citrus
not
as
broad
as
a
well
balanced
hef
but
better
than
most
american
hef
this
american
wheat
has
some
sugar
cane
and
citrus
quality
a
bit
soapy
floral
but
very
subdued
by
the
hops
and
sugar
a
bit
of
a
zest
of
peppermint

overall
its
worth
a

drinkability
is
high
this
is
kind
of
the
definition
of
a
sessionable
beer
beer
is
thin
and
has
some
fruit
esters
on
the
palate
but
its
all
relatively
minimal
beer
is
good
though
overall
im
really
enjoying
it
its
cold
and
wet
and
finishes
without
a
grainy
aftertaste
really
enjoyable
i
have
drank
this
beer
many
times
and
never
remembered
being
this
disappointed
dthis
beer
is
a
gateway
beer
into
wheat
beer
for
many
in
the
midwest
as
it
is
available
at
many
restaurants
and
bars
its
tasty
and
dependable
md
drinkable
but
completely
average
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
peppery

lingers
throughtout
over
the
bready
yeast
and
citrus
fruit
notes
into
a
sweet

dry
finish
the
brest
yeast
is
prominent
adding
comlexity
and
fullness
tothis
beer
there
is
some
clive
and
subtle
corriander
balanced
out
ny
the
sweetness
fromthe
banana
citrus
peel
character
there
is
a
strong

peel
flavor
that
becomes
more
forward
as
the
beer
warms
slightly
tart
finish
complex
yet
very
refreshing
and
easy
to

my
overall
impression
of
the
brew
is
that
its
an
excellent
staple
beer
although
not
fantastic
i
have
certainly
been
a
repeat
customer
for
this
particular
product
of
boulevard
brewery
in
fact
im
a
repeat
customer
of
many
of
boulevards
beers
as
its
a
great
brewery
drinkability
light
flavorful
refreshing
this
is
quite
a
drinkable
beer
indeed
d
not
very
potent
in
smell
or
taste
but
refreshing
nonetheless
d
enjoyable
beer
nice
clean
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
very
drinkable
beer
and
that
is
one
of
its
best
qualities
great
if
you
want
to
have
a
few
with
most
types
of
dinner
this
was
actually
my
intro
beer
that
exposed
me
to
beer
outside
of
the
big
3
lagers
i
constantly
get
friends
to
try
this
and
it
rarely
disappoints
and
helps
convert
quite
a
few
to
try
more
overall
it
is
a
wheat
beer
nothing
too
special
nothing
too
terrible
just
a
wheat
beer
tip
this
beer
is
an
excellent
choice
to
pair
with
fish
and
seafood
dishes
especially
those
with
lemonbutter
sauces
it
really
complements
the
food
and
the
food
brings
out
the
flavor
in
the
beer
in
a
big
way
also
good
with
pesto
and
alfredo
pasta
dishes
as
well
i
found
the
body
on
the
thin
side
but
the
beer
was
very
effervescent
drinkability
was
also
just
ok
overall
if
this
is
a
hefe
its
not
a
very
good
one
if
its
not
then
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
this
is
my
first
beer
from
a
brewery
ive
heard
nothing
but
good
things
about
i
hope
the
rest
of
the
lineup
is
better
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
when
all
you
want
is
a
decent
beer
to
end
the
day
this
is
it
is
it
a
masterpiece
of
brewing
genius
no
but
it
is
a
good
beer
overall
its
a
pretty
good
and
extremely
sessionable
beer
much
happier
drinking
this
than
some
bmc
when
there
is
a
limited
offering
hazy
blone
with
a
pure
white
head
of
fizz
that
leaves
very
little
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
barely
a
whiff
of
sour
citrus
and
wheat
malt
this
beer
is
light
in
the
flavor
department
as
well
light
wheat
maltsoft
lemon
and
clove
nice
medium
light
mouthfeel
with
soft
carbonation
this
beer
is
way
too
light
for
my
tastes
overall
a
pretty
plain
basic
beer
not
bad
but
not
special
either
there
are
better
apwas
out
there
d
quite
refreshing
but
too
much
like
a
glass
of
cool
water
on
a
summer
day
than
something
really
interesting
golden
straw
color
and
hazy
the
wheat
beer
had
soft
aromas
of
wheat
and
honey
easy
to
drink
with
mellow
banana
wheat
light
citrius
hiding
in
the
background
i
felt
it
was
a
little
lean
in
body
but
quite
enjoyable
certainly
a
great
clean
wheat
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
poured
a
transparent
yellow
with
a
bigh
white
head
and
good
carbonation
nose
is
wheat
citrus
banana
taste
is
pretty
boring
nothing
but
a
light
fizzy
booze
until
the
very
end
when
i
found
some
banana
wheat
and
citrus
body
wa
thin
mouthfeel
was
to
carbonated
and
not
appealing
at
all
this
fits
the
american
wheat
profile
very
well
and
is
a
go
to
beer
for
me
at
bars
with
less
than
spectacular
craft
selections
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
with
with
a
2
finger
fluffy
head
that
recedes
to
a
off
white
ring
it
looks
good
the
smell
is
bready
with
some
lemon
zest
some
fruit
and
yeast
the
taste
is
slight
it
has
a
yeast
and
lemon
taste
with
a
tint
malthop
background
the
mouth
fell
was
watery
and
light
and
just
non
descript
as
this
wheat
beer
is
its
just
average
at
best
so
many
others
wheat
brews
from
new
glarus
to
gumballhead
to
oberon
to
a
liitle
sumpin
in
my
area
to
buy
this
one
its
ok
drinkable
but
its
just
not
memorable
wont
try
this
one
again
to
many
other
great
wheats
out
there
poured
into
the
glass
a
medium
yellow
to
dark
straw
color
very
transparent
in
the
glass
a
small
white
head
forms
on
top
and
quickly
dissolves
away
the
twang
of
a
yeasty
scent
hits
the
nose
along
with
mellow
aroma
of
wheat
it
finishes
with
a
light
lemon
citrus
fragrance
a
bread
and
yeast
flavor
hits
the
front
of
the
palate
as
it
reaches
the
back
a
mild
grassy
with
touch
of
pine
bitterness
comes
through
that
bitterness
lingers
and
the
taste
stays
there
long
after
the
beer
has
washed
away
a
thin
watery
texture
with
the
strong
feel
of
carbonation
hitting
at
the
halfway
point
it
continues
all
the
way
through
till
the
finish
the
beer
as
a
whole
is
okay
the
color
is
weak
and
a
little
lackluster
the
scent
and
taste
are
true
to
the
style
and
stay
consistent
the
feel
had
a
lot
more
carbonation
than
i
would
like
still
this
is
solid
beer
a
good
session
beer
and
a
very
good
choice
for
summertime
camping
notes
i
didnt
necessarily
think
the
flavors
were
offensive
but
there
was
nothing
great
about
it
one
of
the
weakest
beers
from
boulevard
this
beer
holds
up
well
even
almost
ten
years
after
i
had
my
first
its
still
a
solid
example
of
the
style
overall
when
i
buy
the
boulevard
mixed
case
i
drink
this
beer
i
would
not
pour
it
out
but
would
not
buy
it
primarily
either
this
is
a
beer
that
i
really
wont
drink
from
the
bottle
i
first
had
it
ontap
and
havent
been
able
to
make
the
switch
to
bottle
its
a
very
flavorful
yet
light
beer
my
girlfriend
will
order
it
when
were
out
and
shes
not
much
of
a
beer
drinker
so
that
shows
that
the
drinkability
is
relatively
high
this
is
a
great
option
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
wheat
brew
d
like
that
carbonated
lemon
water
they
sell
to
joggers
needs
more
beer
characteristics
lots
of
lemon
and
not
much
else
easy
to
drink
yes
but
in
a
girly
way
d
feels
like
a
beer
in
mouthfeel
looks
bad
smells
like
nothing
and
tastes
weak
did
i
get
a
bad
beer
certainly
drinkable
very
smooth
creamy
texture
and
nice
sweet
and
sour
balance
with
refreshing
dryness
make
this
a
very
sessionable
brew
i
could
see
myself
putting
this
into
a
summer
lineup
if
it
were
readily
available
though
thirstquenching
and
refreshing
yearround
stands
out
in
a
lineup
of
typically
bland
pale
wheats
for
a
nonhoppy
wheat
this
is
very
nice
overallnotes
ive
had
a
ton
of
experiences
with
this
beer
its
in
the
bottle
and
ontap
everywhere
in
como
nothing
great
but
an
okay
beer
id
like
to
reiterate
it
works
a
lot
better
with
a
lemon
drinkability
could
be
a
good
session
beer
satisfying
without
being
filling
drinkability
as
a
kansas
citian
this
was
the
first
beer
outside
of
budweiser
id
tried
it
was
also
the
beer
that
showed
there
was
more
to
beer
than
the
watery
taste
of
budweiser
and
other
such
beers
coming
back
to
it
years
later
the
unfiltered
wheat
is
not
quite
what
i
remember
it
lacks
taste
and
smell
but
overall
it
is
an
average
american
wheat
and
a
decent
beer
to
sip
on
a
great
intro
beer
for
the
macrolover
but
pretty
mild
and
uninspired
for
more
wellversed
drinkers
this
beer
serves
an
important
purpose
it
is
the
largest
selling
craft
beer
in
the
american
midwest
as
such
it
is
the
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
a
great
many
people
it
was
my
first
craft
beer
and
look
at
me
now
ma
kansas
city
loves
this
beer
it
competes
very
well
with
established
bmc
brands
its
hard
to
find
a
shock
top
or
blue
moon
tap
in
kc
because
blvd
wheat
is
so
popular
this
beer
pays
the
bills
and
allows
boulevard
to
make
their
consistently
amazing
smokestack
series
but
all
of
that
doesnt
mean
that
unfiltered
wheat
isnt
itself
an
enjoyable
product
this
is
decent
beer
d
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
drink
that
makes
this
a
very
pleasurable
experience
aside
from
the
disappointing
appearance
it
really
holds
up
a
nicely
made
american
wheat
beer
without
being
out
of
balance
and
tasting
artificial
the
beer
feels
thin
and
the
carbonation
seems
to
rapidly
dissipate
after
the
bottle
is
opened
but
its
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
could
probably
have
a
pitcher
of
this
during
a
hot
summer
night
i
bet
its
better
on
tap
overall
an
ok
wheat
not
much
there
but
its
not
bad
d
its
ok
but
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
have
another
recommended
ill
bet
its
great
on
tap
outside
on
a
real
hot
day
unfortunately
i
am
having
it
mostly
warm
as
i
would
prefer
on
a
really
cool
day
indoors
i
just
have
to
imagine
the
poolside
my
pool
is
closed
for
the
season
feel
is
thin
and
watery
too
but
with
moments
of
smoothness
punctuated
by
light
acidity
light
to
moderate
sometimes
fluffy
carbonation
really
nice
atmosphere
decent
appearance
and
solid
complex
but
somewhat
subtle
nose
flavor
is
nice
and
feel
is
ok
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
quaff
overall
this
is
an
average
wheat
beer
nothing
special
but
a
solid
session
beer
while
its
not
really
full
or
complex
it
makes
for
a
good
session
or
a
transition
beer
for
people
who
havent
had
a
lot
of
luck
with
ales
poured
from
a
16
ounce
metal
that
were
available
all
over
kansas
city
during
my
recent
visit
light
tangarine
in
color
minimal
head
and
lace
a
light
wiff
of
fruit
lemon
yeast
light
fruit
light
lemon
some
yeastywheatyness
just
nothing
special
decent
warm
weather
sessioner
or
to
wash
down
a
burger
not
much
beyond
the
basics
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
better
wheat
beers
out
there
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
while
drinkability
excellent
session
beer
until
the
carbonation
and
subtle
sour
flavor
catch
up
with
you
not
bad
at
all
great
carbonation
looks
pretty
smells
pretty
and
is
overall
a
decent
wheat
some
of
the
low
marks
i
think
are
from
fans
that
are
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
d
not
terrible
but
i
can
think
of
a
ton
of
other
apwas
id
reach
for
over
this
one
the
taste
was
a
little
offputting
at
first
but
its
not
bad
and
certainly
drinkable
on
those
hot
summer
days
d
not
my
favorite
in
this
style
i
wopuld
probably
try
it
again
in
a
bottle
to
be
fair
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
seeing
as
though
there
are
a
ton
of
better
examples
of
this
style
available
overall
not
bad
though
cheers
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
was
incredibly
thirsty
after
work
and
this
hit
the
spot
worked
my
way
through
4
of
these
easily
and
they
refreshed
nicely
and
sit
lightly
didnt
feel
it
was
a
chore
to
drink
and
it
makes
a
very
nice
summer
brew
told
the
bartender
it
is
absolutely
a
contender
in
a
good
starter
craft
to
keep
at
the
bar
since
he
is
trying
to
slowly
work
in
a
craft
beer
selection
that
would
appeal
to
the
masses
in
our
town
i
think
this
is
a
good
easy
drinker
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
all
enjoyed
it
for
sure
overall
this
is
a
wheat
beer
thats
not
that
bad
but
its
also
not
that
good
not
a
bad
option
overall
do
not
reccomend
easy
to
drink
but
no
flavor
got
a
6
pack
at
the
beverage
warehouse
in
arab
al
really
looked
forward
to
this
beer
nice
packaging
looked
interesting
i
have
never
had
any
other
boulevard
beers
but
read
good
things
about
it
so
i
gave
this
a
shot
and
i
am
far
from
impressed
it
starts
out
good
the
beer
looks
nice
a
nice
yellow
with
a
little
bit
of
head
the
smell
wasnt
too
special
yeast
and
maybe
some
citrus
really
not
that
strong
and
thats
about
as
good
as
it
gets
this
beer
barely
has
any
flavor
at
all
o
it
is
fizzy
but
not
tasty
if
i
had
to
say
anything
id
say
maybe
some
citrus
but
its
really
not
strong
no
real
aftertaste
either
not
too
happy
with
this
beer
this
is
my
first
and
last
6
pack
of
this
d
this
is
ok
to
me
but
not
great
american
pale
wheat
isnt
my
favorite
style
so
im
sure
im
feeling
a
touch
of
bias
as
a
session
beer
unfiltered
would
do
nicely
pours
to
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
lemonyyellow
with
thin
white
head
thatg
disspiates
soon
and
a
little
carbonation
throughout
nose
is
citrusy
wheat
with
a
touch
of
hops
and
graininess
mouthfeel
is
slightly
tingly
with
a
body
a
little
on
the
thin
side
taste
tries
to
pick
up
the
lemony
citrus
and
wheat
of
the
nose
but
seems
to
be
just
as
much
of
grain
finish
is
slightly
watery
short
and
uninteresting
a
hohum
beer
part
of
the
boulevard
summer
sampler
pours
thin
and
watered
down
not
a
great
appearence
here
kinda
reminds
me
of
my
last
drug
test
for
a
job
i
took
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
weak
too
feel
like
im
barely
drinking
beer
here
by
far
the
worst
beer
in
the
sampler
which
otherwise
was
very
good
the
only
saving
grace
here
is
the
drinkability
ovbviously
they
were
going
for
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
but
this
lacks
any
resemblence
of
anything
worth
mentioning
wouldnt
recommend
even
as
a
summer
lawnmowing
type
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
the
bottle
there
was
a
best
by
date
on
the
bottle
this
particular
bottle
was
still
fresh
for
another
couple
months
poured
a
cloudy
very
very
pale
yellow
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
leaves
nice
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
didnt
do
much
for
me
wasnt
too
impressed
with
it
wheat
citrus
yeast
nothing
really
jumped
out
to
much
compared
to
the
smell
i
was
actually
surprised
by
the
taste
i
didnt
think
i
was
going
to
be
able
to
get
into
this
one
but
once
i
tasted
it
i
found
i
enjoyed
it
wheat
and
a
faint
citrus
taste
really
refreshing
beer
goes
down
pretty
good
not
a
style
of
beer
i
particularly
love
but
i
enjoy
this
wheat
beer
nothing
special
but
its
got
availability
and
drinkability
refreshing
and
probably
nonoffensive
to
someone
who
your
trying
to
get
into
the
better
beer
scene
had
a
12oz
bottle
about
a
year
past
its
freshness
date
the
beer
was
a
sort
of
hazy
yellow
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
its
little
bit
retreating
rather
quickly
tastewise
it
was
an
overly
simple
wheat
beer
with
citrus
hints
that
were
too
mild
to
give
the
beer
any
real
worth
it
is
drinkable
if
nothing
better
is
on
hand
as
was
the
case
last
night
when
i
tried
this
but
is
otherwise
undeserving
of
your
time
and
money
hot
a
bad
beer
poured
with
a
white
head
and
no
lace
head
almost
completely
disappeard
quickly
hazy
yellow
color
mild
wheat
beer

flavor
is

could

from
notes
on
friday

2009
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
boulevard
beer
started
off
my
drinking
night
with
dales
pale
ale
then
green
flash
west
coast
ipa
and
then
boulevards
unfiltered
wheat
and
this
one
not
only
put
out
the
hop
fire
in
my
mouth
but
it
was
incredibly
delicious
i
dont
understand
all
the
negative
reviews
on
here
because
this
one
hits
the
mark
with
me
i
guess
thats
the
beauty
of
ba
everyones
tastes
are
different
i
wrote
boulevard
and
told
them
of
my
fondness
for
its
unfiltered
wheat
and
they
thanked
me
for
my
nice
comments
this
will
be
a
regular
in
my
beer
rotation
thanks
boulevard
for
not
only
nice
packaging
and
freshness
dates
but
at
friar
tuck
in
savoy
il
a
reasonably
priced
six
pack
6
99
i
used
to
slam
these
down
in
college
but
for
now
it
was
a
drain
pour
for
me
sorry
boulevard
but
this
one
was
brewed
for
the
masses
and
they
can
keep
it
12oz
stub
pours
a
cloudy
and
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
wheat
yeast
and
lemon
with
slight
hints
of
orange
mouthfeel
is
over
carbonated
and
seems
rather
fizzy
in
the
mouth
tastes
are
similar
to
aromas
yeast
lemon
wheat
trace
hop
and
grassy
finish
for
balance
quenching
for
a
hot
summer
day
very
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
line
of
bubbles
even
though
it
is
unfiltered
this
beer
was
not
as
cloudy
as
most
wheat
beers
wasnt
too
impressed
with
the
aromas
or
lack
of
aromas
i
could
barely
detect
a
fruity
yeasty
aroma
flavors
are
also
very
simple
and
muted
a
slight
bready
citrus
and
that
is
about
it
the
finish
is
nice
a
crisp
dry
finish
similar
to
a
white
wine
this
is
very
drinkable
however
it
could
have
used
more
aroma
and
flavor
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
bland
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
body
light
if
not
slightly
watery
but
not
entirely
unpleasant
this
beers
low
abv
makes
it
sessionable
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
ok
not
unpleasant
but
i
can
find
better
wheat
beers
than
this
d
boulevard
wheat
is
widely
available
in
missouri
and
is
a
good
fall
back
when
at
the
bar
there
is
good
reason
for
this
its
extremely
drinkable
and
not
high
in
alcohol
which
makes
it
a
great
session
beer
its
also
very
refreshing
during
a
hot
day
and
is
a
good
alternative
during
football
season
and
tailgates
i
do
rate
this
beer
high
on
the
drinkability
it
does
go
down
smooth
and
easy
and
would
be
easy
to
have
several
of
these
very
nice
choice
for
just
a
simple
beer
you
want
to
enjoywithout
getting
too
deep
into
its
profile
also
would
be
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
day
drinkability
just
another
light
easydrinking
wheat
beer
though
it
is
a
bit
too
high
carbonation
for
me
poured
a
medium
yellow
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
lightly
citrus
an
easy
drinking
beer
almost
too
light
for
my
taste
smooth
up
front
with
a
bitter
end
note
makes
a
solid
session
beer
pours
a
cloudy
almost
electric
yellow
colored
body
with
a
white
color
head
small
has
a
fruity
smell
almost
like
a
peach
fizzy
aroma
but
not
too
strong
has
a
watery

kind
of

i
was
very
disappointed
with
this
one
ive
enjoyed
it
in
the
past
when
i
was
still
getting
my
beer
chops
but
my
experience
has
amplified
the
flaws
of
this
beer
my
biggest
gripe
is
with
the
mouthfeel
way
too
lightbodied
way
too
much
carbonation
which
really
got
in
the
way
of
what
little
flavor
there
was
to
begin
with
it
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
so
it
may
be
a
decent
transition
beer
for
some
but
i
can
only
tentatively
recommend
that
this
is
by
far
the
weakest
of
boulevards
yearround
beers
i
seem
to
remember
it
being
slightly
better
on
tap
so
ill
have
to
test
that
theory
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
the
style
its
light
in
body
and
has
a
medium
carbonation
level
drinkability
is
good
and
im
sure
it
would
satisfy
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
unfortunately
it
came
up
way
short
today
d
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
quality
wheat
flavor
and
a
solid
citrus
balance
this
is
a
well
made
example
of
the
style
and
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
good
flavor
good
drinkability
good
beer
it
aint
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
but
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
a
hazey
straw
color
with
a
fair
white
head
that
dies
off
after
a
few
minutes
and
a
pretty
whimpy
lace
effect
the
aroma
is
clean
but
pretty
mild
wheat
and
sweet
citrus
the
flavor
is
a
nice
crisp
cereal
sweet
wheat
with
a
very
fine
but
refreshing
carbonation
very
drinkable
a
bit
thin
but
nothing
unusual
for
the
style
i
liked
this
much
more
than
the
pale
ale
not
bad
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
thirsty
and
want
something
thats
light
extra
beer
over
all
taste
very
good
i
was
very
impress
with
the
appearance
beer
looked
beautiful
neat
finish
miles
away
from
a
great
imperial
stout
but
this
is
a
great
beer
for
what
it
is
my
goto
wheat
drinkability
is
high
its
a
bit
boring
but
tastey
enough
and
easily
sessionable
drinkability
try
some
yourself
this
beer
is
good
on
its
own
or
with
a
beef
or
pork
centered
meal
especially
a
good
hamburger
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
very
light
hazy
yellow
smell
is
light
and
wheaty
with
a
hint
of
lemon
taste
is
fairly
light
with
hints
of
lemon
citrus
flavors
and
a
wheaty
backbone
very
light
refreshing
mouthfeel
extremely
drinkable
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
may
become
my
goto
beer
for
bbqs
this
year
very
refreshing
an
unmistakable
taste
of
the
midwest
easy
drinkin
and
laid
back
its
always
too
long
for
me
between
sessions
of
this
lovable
ole
guy
dont
get
me
wrong
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
here
but
if
your
in
for
a
night
of
drinking
and
you
need
a
reliable
buddy
hes
here
for
you
with
just
the
right
amount
of
kick
to
bring
you
along
overall
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
there
is
really
nothing
to
special
about
it
i
watched
as
a
friend
of
mine
sipped
his
boulevard
wheat
out
of
a
24
oz
glass
he
was
smiling
definitely
enjoying
his
choice
of
brew
i
asked
for
one
i
couldnt
help
it
the
misty
golden
color
captivated
me
but
the
moment
i
tasted
it
i
realized
that
my
expectations
would
go
unmet
it
was
drinkable
but
totally
unremarkable
its
flavors
were
too
light
at
the
beginning
the
middle
and
at
the
end
on
my
palate
its
thinness
left
me
wanting
more
so
i
had
a
chimay
while
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
given
the
light
body
and
mild
flavors
it
doesnt
set
my
world
on
fire
it
comes
through
as
slightly
bland
and
watered
down
superior
drinkablility
if
i
ever
have
to
decide
a
beer
that
will
be
a
gateway
beer
into
the
craft
world
for
a
friend
or
acquaintance
ill
hand
them
one
of
these
overall
man
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
was
very
easy
to
drink
flavor
wasnt
much
but
the
aroma
was
very
impressive
great
example
of
the
style
this
is
definitely
a
great
summer
beer
d
stellar
so
refreshing
you
could
just
suck
these
down
like
a
bud
light
or
something
if
you
chose
to
d
light
smooth
and
refreshing
with
fair
flavor
knocked
back
a
few
of
these
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
tangy
wheat
with
a
hint
of
banana
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
without
the
banana
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
wheat
beer
however
instead
of
showing
me
how
good
wheat
beer
can
be
it
reminds
me
of
how
great
other
wheat
beers
are
i
could
drink
this
again
but
there
are
so
many
better
wheat
beers
out
there
that
i
cant
see
myself
making
it
back
to
this
one
anytime
soon
overall
thank
you
vancer
for
this
beer
you
are
a
good
man
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
rather
boring
i
may
be
a
caught
up
in
the
extreme
beer
trend
but
this
was
just
not
aggressive
enough
for
what
it
was
it
was
pretty
good
though
drinkabliblity
is
ok
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
pours
a
13
inch
head
with
decent
retention
theres
decent
to
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
and
slight
fruit
fits
the
style
tastes
of
sweet
malt
and
a
light
fruit
very
crisp
low
carbonation
wheat
overall
not
too
bad
a
little
too
weak
for
my
tastes
but
easy
to
drink
not
much
there
to
slow
you
down
and
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
going
thin
lawnmower
beer
serviceable
as
token
craft
brew
in
macro
bar
not
running
out
to
the
beer
store
to
find
it
overall
it
is
a
good
wheat
and
very
drinkable
the
scent
is
of
slight
lemon
and
wheat
presence
there
is
a
touch
more
flavor
in
the
taste
than
there
was
in
the
smell
though
not
a
whole
lot
more
this
is
definitely
a
mild
and
muted
beer
the
beer
is
extremely
light
bodied
that
said
its
an
easydrinking
bottle
or
pint
crisp
clean
creamy
grain
taste
with
little
else
very
inoffensive
beer
that
would
probably
be
good
for
introducing
someone
to
a
non
lightlager
style
d
fairly
benign
beer
all
things
considered
not
pretty
to
look
at
but
pretty
decent
in
the
other
categories
one
of
those
meh
kind
of
experiences
im
thinking
ok
whats
next
and
im
only
halfway
through
the
glass
easy
enough
to
finish
but
not
one
id
need
to
have
again
of
the
6
boulevards
i
tried
this
was
the
least
impressive
still
thanks
for
the
gift
nick
a
bit
more
in
the
taste
but
not
much
seems
to
be
a
bit
muted
and
flavorless
hint
of
wheat
and
lemon
in
the
taste
not
very
flavorable
but
very
crushable
d
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
and
would
make
a
good
session
beer
d
quite
drinkable
no
strong
flavors
to
get
in
the
way
d
an
average
american
wheat
quite
refreshing
during
missouri
summers
a
nice
crisp
feel
to
the
taste
poured
at
a
chilled
temperature
i
think
this
released
the
taste
a
bit
better
than
last
time
citrus
and
sweet
corn
taste
wo
the
starch
definitely
better
than
last
time
refreshing
beer
went
down
quite
smooth
the
crisp
didnt
turn
into
bitterness
pours
a
very
pale
urine
colorslightly
hazed
with
a
thin
white
head
that
lasts
only
for
a
few
seconds
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
nose
is
sweetgrainy
and
lemonyvery
fresh
earthiness
and
inviting
aromas
this
american
wheat
is
quite
the
easy
drinker
crisp
grassy
notes
and
lemon
rind
zest
seems
on
the
right
track
for
the
stylebut
a
bit
to
tame
boulevard
needs
to
turn
up
the
flavor
about
three
more
notches
a
thin
body
and
average
carbonation
make
this
a
great
brew
for
drinkability
smoothcrispclean
and
never
offensivethis
one
aint
about
thinkin
its
about
drinkin
i
have
had
better
unfiltered
wheats
and
probably
would
drink
them
instead
nice
hazy
appearance
and
plenty
of
carbonation
very
clean
but
very
slight
fruity
smell
this
beer
is
much
better
on
tap
when
the
wheatiness
is
more
present
this
is
quickly
becoming
the
new
light
beer
not
the
most
interesting
but
works
well
at
a
tailgaiting
party
d
this
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
it
isnt
horrible
but
when
i
think
unfiltered
wheat
beer
this
isnt
what
i
am
going
for
an
inferior
style
yields
an
inferior
product
these
pale
american
wheat
ales
dont
showcase
anything
that
is
wonderful
about
wheat
beers
pale
ales
witbiers
or
any
other
beer
mediocre
timid
banal
throughout
now
that
thats
off
my
chest
this
beer
has
the
look
of
normal
hefeweizens
with
a
cloudy
canaryyellow
color
however
the
head
formation
and
retention
results
in
a
little
fizziness
and
weakening
aromas
are
lemony
and
acidic
with
light
notes
of
bread
wheat
malt
and
herbal
hops
flavors
emphasize
the
lemon
esters
grassy
hops
and
overall
acidity
while
downplaying
the
comples
yeast
character
and
rich
maltiness
textures
are
thin
acidic
lightly
astringent
and
overall
tart
leaving
maltiness
and
richness
behind
perhaps
a
bit
grainy
finishes
lemony
and
fresh
because
of
the
acidity
and
citrus
notes
drinkability
this
is
a
wheat
beer
for
beginners
light
and
benign
wheaty
taste
hints
of
citrus
banana
pleasant
tasting
bottom
line
wish
these
flavors
were
more
predominant
in
the
beer
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
very
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
great
to
give
to
someone
that
likes
bmc
but
wants
to
try
to
expand
their
horizons
a
bit
d
drinkable
enough
but
other
beers
and
styles
have
more
to
offer
d
drinks
real
good
and
quenches
the
thirst
drinkability
great
with
a
summer
meal
fresh
bottle
brought
by
the
brewery
to
coles
on
the
way
to
cooperstown
some
wheat
taste
yes
yellow
with
a
crowning
white
head
and
some
lace
farmhouse
aroma
high
carbonation
yet
its
all
drinkable
some
citrus
flavour
yes
not
a
bad
one
but
merely
a
warmup
for
their
extremes
not
my
favorite
boulevard
offering
but
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
have
not
had
it
before
i
have
heard
from
a
few
customers
in
my
store
that
boulevard
is
kinda
like
shiner
when
i
comes
to
how
people
think
and
drink
it
it
is
a
very
people
friendly
brew
low
on
the
head
but
some
is
present
some
small
honey
and
hop
whiffs
thin
mouthfeel
but
i
can
see
it
being
refreshing
not
worth
what
i
have
heard
about
it
maybe
on
tap
perhaps
a
very
good
wheat
beer
imo
and
very
close
to
a
borderline
hefe
and
i
love
a
good
hefe
beer
if
your
only
exposure
to
wheat
beers
so
far
has
been
of
the
citrusy
american
variety
give
boulevard
brewing
co
unfiltered
wheat
a
try
and
taste
some
of
the
roots
to
the
whole
wheat
beerhefe
craze
tastes
like
a
decent
wheat
beer
with
a
bit
of
lemonycitrus
taste
to
it
the
mouth
feel
was
light
and
soft
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
its
not
fantastic
but
definitely
a
notch
above
some
other
beers
that
i
have
had
pours
a
hazy
fizzy
golden
yellow
with
a
pillowy
tight
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
smell
is
a
bit
of
wheat
lemon
juice
corriander
nothing
overpowering
taste
isnt
quite
as
full
of
flavor
as
i
am
accustomed
to
however
there
is
a
nice
mellow
wheat
flavor
that
has
a
touch
of
sour
to
it
some
sweet
upfront
honey
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
the
finish
is
ho
hum
not
quite
as
carbonated
as
i
wish
it
was
all
in
all
this
is
a
fine
session
beer
that
i
can
appreciate
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
complex
but
this
is
a
no
brainer
on
a
hot
texas
day
a
fair
amount
of
yeast
is
in
the
bottem
of
the
bottle
that
needs
to
be
sweriled
into
the
beer
i
am
happy
that
this
one
is
unfiltered
it
added
complexity
to
this
berw
this
one
is
a
bit
sour
the
finishes
sweet
the
beer
poured
an
almost
cloudy
lemon
juice
color
as
far
as
wheats
go
this
is
just
avrage
but
fairley
drinkable
well
worth
a
shot
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
one
i
poured
this
into
a
lukas
liquor
pint
glass
the
head
was
gone
within
minutes
it
was
a
little
hazy
but
maybe
a
little
less
than
the
average
wheat
what
is
most
prominent
about
this
brew
is
the
yeasty
flavor
no
doubt
from
the
bottle
fermentation
solid
brew
that
had
a
strong
hefe
presence
that
makes
it
quite
distinct
from
your
average
wheat
active
carbonation
is
correct
but
the
mild
slickness
on
the
finish
is
not
not
the
first
time
ive
noticed
this
with
a
boulevard
beer
still
its
an
easydrinking
summer
brew
and
if
you
like
the
style
i
dont
know
why
you
would
then
its
a
nobrainer
had
ontap
at
the
brewery
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
little
head
and
minimal
lacing
has
a
slight
citrus
smell
along
with
the
prominent
grain
taste
is
primarily
citrusy
with
a
slight
malt
backbone
this
stuff
is
dangerous
in
that
its
like
drinking
water
and
before
you
know
it
youve
had
five
or
six
a
great
wheat
beer
d
easy
one
to
drink
this
would
make
a
good
session
beer
anytime
of
the
year
but
especially
well
during
the
summer
drinkability
is
eh
good
for
a
hot
day
to
knock
the
dust
out
of
your
throat
again
not
bad
for
style
just
not
my
favorite
style
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
the
haziness
typical
of
wheat
beers
healthy
head
and
lacing
strong
lemon
aroma
and
a
light
wheat
flavor
with
some
citrus
taste
is
good
but
not
very
strong
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
with
good
light
mouthfeel
but
not
watery
not
at
all
bad
but
not
that
special
served
in
a
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
the
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
ending
in
the
glass
with
a
hazy
yellow
appearance
14
inch
this
white
head
that
faded
quickly
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
light
making
it
quite
hard
to
detect
anything
very
light
notes
of
wheat
and
grain
not
too
appealing
taste
is
also
extremely
light
consisting
of
a
very
weak
wheat
flavor
and
having
more
of
a
bmc
lager
type
taste
than
a
wheat
ale
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
i
could
see
this
being
a
very
drinkable
summer
beer
when
cold
is
more
important
than
flavor
i
was
dissapointed
with
this
beer
as
it
didnt
have
some
of
the
taste
characteristics
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
im
hoping
this
was
just
a
bad
batch
will
try
again
i
used
to
drink
this
with
a
lemon
wedge
since
that
how
it
was
served
in
all
the
bars
but
i
like
it
better
without
the
lemon
theres
nothing
really
spectacular
about
this
but
this
is
a
solid
tasty
beer
and
the
perfect
refreshment
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
pours
a
light
hazy
yellow
with
a
very
mild
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
mildly
clovey
with
a
bit
of
citrus
the
taste
is
pretty
normal
to
a
pale
wheat
beer
their
are
definite
notes
of
clove
lemon
zest
and
grain
wheat
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
slightly
carbonated
even
though
it
might
not
be
the
best
beer
in
the
world
it
still
is
good
summer
drinking
beer
the
boulevard
unfiltered
wheat
really
puts
there
lunar
ale
to
shame
this
wheat
brew
is
so
much
better
than
the
lunar
very
cloudy
in
appearance
with
an
orange
hue
it
smells
of
citrus
taste
is
just
pleasant
a
little
citrus
up
front
with
a
tasty
mix
in
bannana
and
clove
traits
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
i
will
be
sure
to
keep
a
look
out
for
at
the
resturants
md
on
the
thin
side
but
very
easy
drinking
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
not
a
bad
american
wheat
beer
very
light
somewhat
refreshing
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
above
average
d
very
easy
to
drink
usually
consumed
with
a
lemon
its
not
bad
without
but
it
adds
more
flavor
its
flavor
is
almost
like
a
hefeweizen
but
a
tad
lighter
an
easy
drinker
here
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
taste
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
but
certainly
would
hit
the
spot
on
a
warm
day
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
bright
white
head
that
settles
very
quickly
aroma
initially
comes
off
very
bready
with
lots
of
wheat
and
yeast
aroma
with
a
faint
citrus
note
coming
up
from
the
back
id
liken
it
to
a
witbier
without
the
spices
taste
is
fairly
grassy
with
some
faint
fruity
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
has
a
slight
oily
character
to
it
very
smooth
not
alot
of
carbonation
this
is
an
okay
beer
im
not
sure
if
id
pick
it
up
again
but
i
might
like
to
try
it
fresher
or
on
tap
some
day
this
is
another
one
of
those
consumable
products
available
year
round
but
probably
more
suited
to
my
taste
for
the
warm
summer
days
you
can
sit
back
and
enjoy
several
of
these
sampled
on
32508
a
so
so
beer
like
all
american
pale
wheat
ales
this
does
not
have
the
the
depth
of
a
good
pale
ale
or
the
explosion
of
flavor
that
a
good
hefe
has
something
that
i
probably
wont
try
again
hazy
yellowish
orange
pour
in
a
nice
tall
weizen
glass
short
lived
head
and
a
smell
of
mainly
hearty
wheat
and
a
citrusy
lemon
lightness
about
it
flavor
was
similar
and
not
spiced
like
a
hefeweisen
usually
is
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
possibly
my
new
favorite
american
wheat
beer
light
refreshing
simply
but
with
flavor
and
very
nice
i
thought
d
decent
brew
that
would
definately
suggest
over
blue
moon
anyday
but
cant
beat
a
good
hefe
from
a
sampler
pack
this
bottle
pours
a
hazy
lemonade
yellow
body
with
a
small
vanilla
head
aroma
has
some
lemony
pepper
notes
not
much
else
light
to
light
medium
body
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
taste
has
some
lemony
citrus
and
yeast
thats
about
it
not
much
to
this
one
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
good
thirst
quencher
but
disappointing
as
a
beer
drinkability
its
one
of
those
six
packs
that
takes
a
long
time
for
me
finish
off
because
its
quite
bland
the
drinkability
isnt
high
for
me
verdict
needs
more
of
what
everything
a
decent
beverage
in
a
pinch
and
sadly
im
in
that
pinch
all
too
often
around
this
town
its
smooth
texture
and
sweeter
taste
make
this
easy
on
the
palate
and
id
be
interested
in
trying
this
again
as
the
warm
weather
comes
rolling
around
it
would
seem
to
be
a
very
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
and
it
was
a
nice
accompaniment
to
my
plate
of
chinese
food
that
said
for
now
i
can
only
characterize
this
beer
as
decent
and
a
little
short
on
the
complexity
that
the
beers
label
touts
poured
a
nice
deep
hazy
golden
color
with
decent
white
head
that
stayed
for
a
while
aroma
was
citrusy
and
refreshing
taste
was
again
a
refreshing
citrusy
flavor
mouthfeel
was
good
and
drinkability
was
way
up
there
not
the
most
complex
beer
in
the
world
but
a
nice
quencher
didnt
have
a
glass
so
i
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
had
a
rather
nice
easy
flavour
to
it
a
nice
mixture
of
hops
and
malt
up
front
which
faded
abruptly
to
an
extremely
clean
finish
very
light
but
much
better
than
other
massproduced
light
beers
if
i
lived
in
kc
itd
probably
be
one
id
normally
grab
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
the
overall
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
was
wheat
with
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
this
beer
really
didnt
stand
out
as
opposed
to
other
wheat
beers
all
in
all
i
would
probably
drink
this
agian
but
wouldnt
reach
for
it
automaticly
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
into
a
pint
glass
it
was
a
hazy
pale
straw
color
it
barely
had
a
head
and
it
went
away
quickly
leaving
a
tiny
collar
good
carb
though
the
aroma
was
extremely
weak
and
what
was
there
had
a
weird
smell
that
i
couldnt
identify
the
taste
followed
the
smell
very
weak
with
a
weird
taste
just
not
a
good
beer
once
youve
tried
good
craft
beers
i
could
see
someone
who
is
trying
to
move
beyond
macros
liking
it
but
im
way
past
that
point
one
is
enough
2
5
na
tie
n
poured
into
a
mug
this
beer
is
extremely
pale
and
rather
cloudy
the
head
retention
is
terrible
with
it
fading
away
to
a
thin
film
after
a
moment
nose
is
a
little
grainy
though
all
aspects
of
the
aroma
are
faint
theres
a
little
citrus
note
as
well
taste
is
bland
the
only
difference
between
this
and
a
macro
lager
is
a
slight
wheatiness
grainy
maybe
a
very
little
fruity
and
completely
uninteresting
boulevard
unfiltered
wheat
pours
a
hazy
translucent
yellow
it
gives
off
a
yeasty
aroma
that
is
moderatly
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
overall
the
taste
is
lacking
a
big
bold
flavor
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
but
i
would
seek
out
others
before
coming
back
to
this
one
d
way
too
easy
to
drink
for
a
wheat
beer
of
the
taste
boulevard
has
managed
to
make
a
wheat
beer
that
is
crisp
and
that
is
awesome
d
boulevards
best
selling
beer
is
the
definition
of
a
session
brew
this
light
wheat
is
an
excellent
crossover
for
people
who
know
only
macro
brews
which
explains
why
its
the
best
selling
nonmacro
beer
in
the
midwest
or
so
ive
read
growing
up
in
kansas
city
bully
wheat
was
my
first
venture
away
from
the
anheuserbuschmolsoncoorssabmiller
dynasties
so
it
will
always
hold
a
special
place
in
my
heart
its
the
flagship
beer
from
my
hometown
brewery
and
i
am
willing
to
bet
ive
consumed
more
of
this
beer
than
any
other
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
perfect
for
summer
refreshment
to
me
this
isnt
anything
special
but
i
know
a
lot
of
people
that
love
this
beer
in
my
opinion
if
just
doesnt
have
any
qualities
that
make
it
stand
out
above
the
rest
it
tastes
better
when
served
w
a
lemon
wedge
in
it
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
retention
smells
faintly
of
grapefruit
and
yeast
not
terribly
complex
i
enjoy
the
citrus
flavor
when
in
first
hits
but
the
flavor
is
washed
out
this
beer
really
shines
in
drinkability
great
beer
for
bbqs
and
other
summer
outings
pours
a
rich
cloudy
yellow
a
big
white
head
when
i
pour
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
faint
grain
taste
is
quite
light
wheat
and
perhaps
a
slight
flavour
of
the
yeast
very
little
bittering
you
can
barely
taste
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
excellent
smooth
with
nice
carbonation
not
my
normal
style
of
beer
as
its
pretty
plain
but
most
places
around
here
that
serve
mostly
bmc
products
also
serve
this
making
it
my
savior
beer
a
better
tasting
alternative
to
the
macro
lagers
imo
an
extremely
easy
to
drink
sessionable
ale
also
bottle
conditioned
which
is
a
big
plus
in
my
book
this
is
far
and
away
one
of
my
favorite
beers
its
amazingly
refreshing
especially
after
18
holes
of
golf
on
a
hot
day
its
crisp
but
not
overpowering
slightly
fizzy
just
enough
to
give
it
a
kick
but
most
of
all
its
just
an
easy
beer
to
drink
either
way
if
youre
really
looking
for
a
wheat
beer
or
youre
at
a
sports
bar
with
macros
otherwise
its
not
hard
to
drink
a
few
and
pairs
nicely
with
pub
food
so
in
sum
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
its
still
not
the
awful
budweizeresque
beer
some
have
described
it
as
its
quality
beer
with
a
nice
yeast
sediment
in
the
bottle
that
adds
force
to
the
flavor
my
complain
is
that
that
flavor
is
onedimensional
overall
this
is
a
very
watery
beer
not
much
aroma
taste
or
body
but
it
was
rather
refreshing
d
i
can
drink
about
a
dozen
of
these
before
i
know
what
even
hit
me
they
are
not
filling
a
nice
summer
attribute
had
this
ontap
it
seems
boulevard
products
are
almost
as
available
in
kc
as
bmc
and
not
much
else
to
choose
from
at
the
various
places
i
went
to
over
the
weekend
ordered
without
the
lemon
garnish
typical
wheat
beer
in
appearance
but
nothing
special
this
was
a
cloudy
strawlight
orange
with
a
white
head
not
too
much
going
on
in
the
bouqet
other
than
some
sweet
doughy
notes
taste
was
fine
but
again
unremarkable
appropriate
level
of
sweetness
for
the
style
with
a
crisp
and
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
drinkable
especially
at
this
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
dont
mind
the
texture
i
actually
like
this
category
of
beer
so
i
expect
more
here
in
the
midwest
its
an
old
standby
for
some
people
when
a
dive
bar
has
nothing
better
but
in
that
situation
ill
just
go
with
a
budweiser
because
i
wont
pay
extra
for
something
with
the
same
amount
of
flavor
overall
impression
eh
this
one
is
fine
highly
drinkable
but
nothing
too
exciting
probably
a
good
beer
for
the
heat
of
summer
but
inside
i
found
it
lacking
any
real
personality
paired
this
with
a
dinner
salad
citrus
chicken
and
balasmic
dressing
complimentary
maybe
on
a
hot
day
on
draft
or
at
a
restaurant
on
tap
d
this
beer
is
light
and
boring
with
not
much
interesting
going
on
it
does
have
qualities
that
would
appeal
to
a
bmc
drinker
and
nothing
about
this
beer
would
be
considered
offense
poured
slightly
less
than
a
pint
out
of
the
bottle
carbonation
bubbles
run
up
the
glass
and
the
highly
carbonated
head
quickly
fizzed
away
to
leave
very
little
lace
pale
yelloworange
hazy
color
smelled
yeasty
with
orange
hints
the
taste
was
wheaty
also
with
orange
flavors
as
if
there
was
a
slice
of
orange
right
there
in
the
bottle
the
wheat
taste
was
mild
mostly
sweet
but
with
a
very
slight
bitter
tinge
good
taste
overall
zesty
refreshing
leaves
a
sugared
wet
palate
a
little
more
carbonated
than
your
average
beer
but
it
definately
works
with
the
sweet
taste
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
back
on
a
warm
day
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
small
white
head
which
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
afterwards
the
nose
is
of
slight
maltshops
yeast
grassy
spices
the
taste
is
yeasty
malty
hoppy
nice
blend
of
spices
lightmedium
body
drinkable
a
nice
summer
brew
for
sure
true
to
style
drinkability
excellent
if
you
like
a
less
flavorful
beer
i
used
to
idolize
this
beer
now
that
i
have
trained
my
palate
i
am
less
impressed
but
i
have
to
admit
i
cant
get
it
in
colorado
so
when
ever
im
in
nebraska
im
going
to
pick
up
at
least
a
sixpack
just
because
its
not
a
real
flavor
bomb
doesnt
mean
its
not
good
beer
nice
work
boulevard
brewing
drinkability
is
above
average
i
thought
it
was
refreshing
and
could
drink
a
lot
without
noticing
flavor
seems
a
bit
lacking
to
make
this
a
real
drinker
i
didnt
find
it
very
exciting
at
all
maybe
a
good
gateway
beer
for
some
d
taste
is
definitely
lacking
and
theres
way
too
much
carbonation
in
this
beer
on
the
bright
side
i
did
only
pay
5
dollars
for
the
12
pack
last
chance
liquors
and
it
is
better
than
macro
swill
drinkabilitynotes
a
reasonably
pleasant
example
fairly
wellmade
not
exceptional
but
not
bad
either
thanks
to
pegasus
for
sharing
taste
is
of
wheat
yeast
and
a
little
citrus
again
nothing
to
strong
mouthfeel
is
fine
overall
a
decently
drinkable
wheat
beer
that
i
will
drink
on
occassion
this
was
a
crossover
beer
for
me
so
it
definitely
has
a
place
in
my
fridge
d
i
could
drinka
few
of
these
in
the
summer
months
but
its
nothing
to
get
excited
about
not
a
bad
wheat
beer
but
definitely
not
a
great
one
either
poured
a
very
light
hazy
peachish
orange
color
with
considerable
less
cloudiness
than
other
unfiltered
wheat
beers
somewhat
bland
taste
with
a
very
weak
very
quickly
diminishing
head
and
very
dismal
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
std
pint
glass
the
taste
and
smell
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
all
i
got
from
the
bear
was
the
remninse
of
the
lemon
on
the
side
of
the
glasswhich
i
removed
some
yeast
and
dull
wheat
this
beer
was
served
at
a
bbq
restaurant
and
was
served
far
too
cold
for
good
consumption
so
i
will
leave
that
as
a
caveat
to
my
initial
dislike
of
the
brew
although
it
would
not
improve
the
taste
enough
to
make
it
rate
much
higher
although
i
am
slightly
harsh
on
this
beer
it
is
a
light
refreshing
drinkable
option
and
if
i
am
in
kansas
city
again
enjoying
some
bbq
i
will
probably
have
another
one
boulevard
unfiltered
wheat
doesnt
look
great
the
smell
is
fairly
average
just
wheat
and
yeast
but
there
is
something
about
the
taste
i
just
love
it
it
is
my
always
on
hand
beer
it
just
fits
any
occasion
or
even
if
theres
no
occasion
most
people
think
it
is
pretty
weak
but
ill
always
appreciate
an
unfiltered
wheat
from
boulevard
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
most
part
however
i
think
it
would
actually
be
a
better
seasonal
summer
beer
than
a
year
round
beer
as
its
a
little
too
thing
for
a
year
round
session
brew
its
drinkability
is
quite
high
as
it
goes
down
very
easy
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
can
honestly
say
this
would
be
a
great
session
beer
for
a
hot
and
humid
missouri
summer
day
the
mouth
is
pleasantly
medium
just
not
interesting
enough
to
be
a
session
beer
thanks
beerhandy
for
the
opportunity
and
vancer
and
buckeyenation
for
the
chance
to
revisit
due
to
the
bitterness
i
would
choose
another
wheat
beer
over
this
but
not
a
bad
choice
for
the
price
slightly
above
average
its
a
refreshing
beer
probably
the
most
enjoyable
in
the
summer
this
arrived
with
a
light
bonewhite
head
above
a
cloudy
lemonyellow
beer
the
nose
had
the
sharp
scent
associated
with
wheat
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
with
a
lightly
spicy
dryness
on
the
palate
the
finish
had
a
light
but
not
unpleasant
sourness
followed
by
a
refreshing
dryness
this
was
a
really
good
summer
beer
overall
a
decent
american
wheat
easy
to
drink
but
not
the
best
choice
if
you
are
looking
for
more
flavor
thanks
to
vancer
for
the
bottle
peace
bc
d
if
there
was
nothing
else
available
or
i
just
really
wanted
to
down
a
bunch
of
beer
and
get
drunk
then
this
would
be
a
winner
but
honestly
there
is
nothing
special
here
its
sad
that
this
was
the
first
microbrew
i
could
find
in
ks
and
is
the
only
one
ive
found
widely
available
poured
into
a
glass
with
a
half
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
little
lacing
with
alot
of
carbonation
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
and
a
lemony
scent
with
wheaty
undertones
the
taste
is
very
crisp
with
a
definite
underlying
lemon
flavor
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
while
grilling
outdoors
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
nice
head
at
first
and
good
carbonation
not
much
lacing
aroma
is
there
maybe
not
much
a
little
citrus
maybe
some
wheatstrawlike
malt
not
bad
but
not
really
there
taste
is
refreshing
i
guess
easily
wheaty
a
nice
citrus
a
bit
too
dry
for
me
really
in
the
finish
and
ends
too
quickly
nice
but
forgettable
a
light
haze
hits
the
iris
in
standard
wheat
form
good
bubbling
and
a
thick
foam
that
slowly
recedes
over
time
plenty
of
cloves
with
some
gristy
nortes
but
also
a
very
lagery
aroma
that
i
didnt
care
for
too
much
plenty
of
crystal
malts
that
integrated
well
with
the
wheat
gristy
flavors
very
clean
palate
that
helps
to
explain
the
lager
like
qualities
of
this
beer
i
suppose
im
not
the
best
reviewer
of
the
american
wheat
style
my
personal
preference
for
wheat
beers
trend
more
towards
their
german
and
belgian
cousins
i
have
found
very
few
american
wheats
that
stand
out
this
beer
isnt
any
different
i
find
it
pretty
average
boulevard
wheat
is
an
important
beer
for
me
this
is
the
beer
that
realy
got
me
interested
in
craft
beer
its
a
gateway
beer
since
then
i
have
found
many
beers
much
better
but
you
still
cant
go
wrong
with
this
plus
you
cant
go
anywhere
in
kc
with
out
it
being
available
note
not
bad
but
certainly
nothing
above
average
dont
go
out
of
your
way
looking
for
this
if
you
want
a
good
wheat
for
hot
weather
get
a
12
of
sam
adams
summer
ale
if
you
do
like
this
beer
you
would
probably
love
the
muchstronger
flavored
belgian
beer
alexander
rodenbach
although
you
may
wish
to
read
my
review
on
that
one
and
its
resulting
consequences
im
feeling
a
little
that
way
at
present
after
this
beer
boulevard
wheat
was
pale
yellow
and
very
hazy
it
had
a
white
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
light
yeasty
aroma
with
a
little
lemon
the
taste
was
lemon
and
wheat
it
had
a
dry
finish
the
body
was
light
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
decent
easy
drinking
wheat
ale
had
this
one
while
on
business
in
iowa
recently
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
decent
white
rocky
head
nose
is
barely
there
faint
malt
and
wheat
not
much
else
palate
is
the
same
sadly
thin
watereddown
and
boring
like
the
light
beer
of
wheat
beers
mild
wheat
and
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
light
thin
and
drab
yikes
what
happened
here
i
really
expected
something
better
or
even
good
a
real
disappointment
boulevard
makes
several
well
made
beers
most
wont
really
nock
your
socks
off
but
they
make
beer
that
is
worth
its
price
and
taste
good
i
think
this
might
just
be
my
favorite
from
them
besides
the
bully
porter
this
beer
has
a
very
white
strong
head
that
fades
somewhat
quickly
i
really
love
the
smell
of
a
good
wheat
ale
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
the
scent
is
more
lemony
than
wheaty
but
you
can
smell
both
fairly
easy
the
taste
has
hints
of
lemon
and
wheat
with
a
bit
of
a
yeast
kick
too
it
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
unimpressive
too
light
in
my
opinion
besides
that
it
is
pretty
good
like
all
good
pale
wheat
ales
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
is
great
in
hot
weather
not
the
best
wheat
ale
but
a
good
one
a
cloudy
yellow
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
nose
is
mild
yeast
and
a
bit
of
orange
taste
is
very
subdued
wheat
and
yeast
with
the
tiniest
bit
of
malt
but
a
slighty
ethanol
aftertaste
i
would
describe
it
as
just
a
stepup
from
miller
light
taste
wise
its
not
at
all
unpleasant
though
and
a
very
good
introductory
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
but
with
some
nice
carbonation
quite
the
drinkable
brew
if
you
dont
get
bored
of
it
from
a
single
bottle
at
beer
club
might
as
well
review
it
since
ive
had
it
so
many
times
i
always
drink
this
when
i
travel
a
little
farther
south
where
its
carried
light
orange
and
cloudy
nice
full
wheat
taste
with
a
little
ethanol
on
the
side
nothing
special
but
tasty
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
id
buy
sixers
of
this
if
it
was
distributed
here
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pale
malt
and
wheat
scent
with
a
slight
lemony
edge
and
earthy
aromas
the
taste
is
decent
also
its
very
light
yet
refreshing
with
a
mellow
lemon
feel
and
a
slight
earthy
finish
its
watery
and
lacking
character
but
it
goes
down
smooth
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
wheat
beer
but
nothing
too
special
its
light
and
easy
drinking
color
is
a
hazy
golden
grain
head
is
thick
but
below
average
in
height
retention
is
pretty
good
aroma
is
of
sweet
grains
with
a
touch
of
citrus
the
taste
has
a
nice
combination
of
sweat
grains
backed
by
wheat
flavors
citrus
flavors
are
light
as
is
the
yeastiness
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
solid
american
wheat
but
nothing
here
makes
this
beer
stand
out
from
many
similar
brews
strawgolden
color
barely
not
see
through
head
dies
quickly
to
a
small
ring
aroma
is
hard
to
detect
but
is
wheaty
and
zesty
the
taste
is
not
too
complex
lemon
and
other
citrus
zest
with
a
bit
of
a
grainwheat
flavor
in
aftertaste
kind
of
like
fresh
lemon
grass
the
malt
is
quite
sweet
as
well
and
there
is
a
little
bit
of
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
i
was
suprised
at
the
mouthfeel
i
dont
know
if
i
just
really
wanted
a
beer
or
what
but
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
very
sparkling
and
tangy
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
summer
beer
overall
this
brew
goes
down
very
smooth
highly
drinkable

hot

during

months
drinks
pretty

better
on

imo
overall
it
was
quite
drinkable
i
enjoyed
every
single
one
the
barmaid
brought
to
my
table
it
was
a
little
different
from
the
norm
but
still
enjoyable
pretty
disappointing
beer
for
me
as
someone
else
said
it
uninteresting
is
the
perfect
word
to
describe
this
beer
is
it
a
decent
alternative
to
bmc
yes
would
i
buy
this
again
when
there
is
any
other
decent
micro
on
the
shelf
no
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
low
level
head
scents
of
bread
and
thats
about
it
on
the
nose
flavor
is
yeasty
maybe
with
some
slight
citrus
flavors
this
was
a
pretty
dull
uninteresting
beer
without
much
going
on
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
but
theres
a
fizziness
issue
here
that
hurts
both
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
carbonation
is
a
little
high
and
the
body
a
little
low
but
expectable
overall
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
for
both
bullies
and
whimps
alike

i
couldnt
pick
up
anything
it
does
have
the
citrusy
bread
smell
associated
with
most
wheats
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
its
called
hoppy
wheat
yet
no
smell
of
hops
no
real
taste
of
hops
and
it
looks
like
the
ibu
level
is
in
the
20s
i
expect
quite
a
bit
more
for
a
beer
with
hoppy
in
the
name
that
being
said
it
does
have
a
different
taste
than
a
typical
wheat
its
very
drinkable
and
is
a
nice
twist
on
wheat
beers
just
wish
theyd
hopped
it
up
a
bit
more
will
absolutely
seek
out
and
purchase
again
this
one
was
awesome
if
it
ever
becomes
available
in
cans
this
could
be
a
go
to
for
float
trips
and
outdoor
excursions
this
is
my
go
to
session
beer
well
rounded
taste
and
i
love
the
cloudy
sedimenthefepulp
but
the
texture
is
too
effervescent
fizzy
for
me
one
of
the
best
beers
boulevard
makes
wish
the
hop
flavoring
matched
the
aroma
i
am
drinking
this
three
months
before
its
best
by
date

it

nose
with
pine
over

it

straw
under

thick
moussey

finely
bubbled
offwhite
foam
cap
the
flavors
are
very
well
rounded
and
the
body
and
texture
suggest
the
presence
of
some
belgian
yeast
it
has
more
hops
than
a
normal
wheat
beer
but
they
are
restrained
and
not
over
powering
a
hint
of
caramel
on
the
palate
combined
with
traces
of
bready
wheat
constrains
and
balances
the
hops
this
is
full
bodied
with
above
average
creamy
soft
carbonation
the
perfect
combination
of
all
things

with
flavor
you
pick
up
citrus
and
some
nice
malts
this
is
a
nice
wheat
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
and
smooth
you
pick
up
on
the
citrus
but
it
has
a
clean
finish
to
it
there
is
nothing
overpowering
in
this
brew
80
acre
hoppy
wheat
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
overall
im
giving
80
acre
hoppy
wheat
a
4
5
out
5
overall
tasty
and
refreshing
smooth
wheat
beer
and
one
of
my
goto
beers
for
something
different
than
312
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
theres
never
been
a
ton
of
pale
wheat
ales
out
there
so
this
is
definitely
a
worthy
example
of
the
style
was
a
little
leary
about
this
beer
when
i
read
it
was
hoppy
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
taste
light
on
the
pallet
with
light
aftertaste
recommend
pure
white
head
crests
around
half
a
finger
and
quickly
sizzles
off
to
a
light
surface
dusting
while
wispy
what
lacing
there
is
sticks
quite
well
to
the
glass
sides
the
liquid
is
cloudy
but
does
not
display
any
floating
particulate
widespread
and
superactive
bubbles
fill
the
glass
overall
a
light
orange
to
yellow
color
the
nose
shows
off
the
wheat
proudly
but
its
mainly
an
explosion
of
grapefruit
and
orange
citrus
not
overly
hoppy
there
is
a
bubblegum
to
pie
dough
element
at
the
same
time
theres
a
burst
of
black
pepper
and
green
tea
strong
presence
without
being
overpowering
mediumbodied
sour
from
all
that
muscular
citrus
the
powerful
carbonation
both
brings
prickle
and
limits
the
soaking
in
of
the
pucker
factor
floral
with
that
same
bubblegum
aspect
delivers
more
peach
apricot
cherry
fruit
flavors
here
notes
of
clove
and
lesser
pepper
not
that
dry
but
closer
to
that
end
of
the
spectrum
even
as
you
never
feel
the
flavors
are
truncated
as
a
result
maybe
a
too
clingy
for
fullon
refreshment
but
its
liveliness
is
very
attractive
and
it
is
easy
to
keep
on
sipping
pulls
it
off
well
edit
makes
for
an
excellent
shower
beer
poured
into
a

the
taste
is

overall
not
a
bad
brew
would
have
liked
to
get
some
fresher
bottles
overall
this
beer
combines
everything
i
like
about
wheat
beer
and
gave
it
a
better
hop
profile
but
not
too
overpowering
another
terrific
beer
from
boulevard
i
will
definitely
buy

into

and
they
play
off
of
each
other
very
well
light
passionfruit
sweetness
and
very
nuanced
it
has
a
really
good
flavor
dont
get
me
wrong
but
the
overall
experience
lacks
in
something
i
dont
want
to
sound
snobbish
for
a
ba
but
it
doesnt
seem
as
elegant
and
nebco
is
brewing
out
of
the
back
parking
lot
of
a
car
dealership
what
i
mean
is
this
beer
is
best
for
warm
weather
whereas
nebcos
alpha
weizen
i
could
but
cant
drink
all
yr
round
it
is
a
wonder
why
i
dont
drink
this
more
often
always
spot
on
the
wheat
and
hops
work
perfectly
together
while
different
interpretations
it
is
up
there
with
karbachs
weisse
versa
as
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
hybrids
that
are
not
full
on
hefes
overall
despite
being
past
the
best
by
date
on
the
bottle
the
beer
was
good
i
think
it
could
be
because
the
store
i
bought
it
from
kept
it
refrigerated
the
only
thing
that
might
identify
this
beer
as
a
wheat
beer
to
me
is
by
the
appearance
there
really
was
no
telltale
sign
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
the
hop
aroma
and
flavors
are
excellent
if
you
are
an
apa
fan
where
you
want
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
and
aroma
but
not
a
ton
of
bitterness
this
is
right
up
your
alley
if
you
dont
like
wheat
beers
dont
be
turned
off
by
this
beer
because
it
doesnt
show
if
you
do
like
wheat
beers
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
overall
it
is
a
really
good
beer
though
and
the
framework
really
relies
on
the
hops
and
if
it
were
a
house
that
frame
would
be
made
of
solid

slightly

with
lots

decent
beer
nice
lemony
hop
profile
but
im
getting
a
strong
herbal
flavor
and
its
offputting
seems
to
be
subsiding
as
im
making
my
way
through
the
glass
though
orange
is
coming
through
a
bit
more
finishes
really
clean
and
dry
i
dk
decent
beer
i
guess
but
im
still
getting
these
herbal
notes
that
are
typical
of
witbiers
low
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
great
beer
i
really
enjoy
the
hop
profile
yet
the
bitterness
for
me
is
real
smooth
very
bright
and
citrusy
and
a
little
more
carbonated
which
works
in
its
favor
overall
an
incredible
pale
wheat
beer
and
importantly
one
that
isnt
trying
to
be
something
its
not
while
oberon
is
and
remains
the
standard
for
traditional
pale
wheat
ales
this
in
my
book
is
a
marvelous
middle
ground
between
oberon
and
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
which
is
a
wheat
ale
that
drinks
like
an
ipa
this
is
definitely
a
wheat
beer
but
has
just
enough
additional
hops
to
really
stand
out
without
blurring
the
style
line
too
much
very
impressed
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
finish
is
slightly
sticky
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
the
light
feel
tropical
and
citrus
notes
and
higher
levels
of
carbonation
keep
you
going
back
for
more
pours
a
very
golden
straw
color
with
some
foamy
white
head
smell
is
pretty
sweet
with
a
lot
of
wheat
and
malt
aroma
and
a
touch
of
hops
taste
is
almost
all
wheat
beer
not
bad
at
all
but
not
really
any
hop
flavor
3
or
4
years
ago
i
would
have
absolutely
loved
this
beer
it
is
just
missing
that
kick
that
sumpin
sumpin
and
gumballhead
have
dont
get
me
wrong
still
a
very
good
beer
and
i
will
drink
the
6
i
have
happily
however
if
you
are
looking
for
a
true
hoppy
wheat
try
one
of
the
others
if
you
are
looking
for
something
more
balanced
or
even
tipping
the
scale
the
other
way
i
would
recommend
this
for
sure
overall
the
hoppiness
worked
very
well
in
the
aroma
but
falls
off
just
a
little
too
much
in
the
taste
if
that
balance
worked
out
this
would
be
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
this
was
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
ive
had
helps
that
it
was
hopped
up
of
course
overall
a
very
complete
wheat
ale
hopforward
with
a
satisfying
grainy
finish
recommended
o
refreshing
brew
that
makes
for
a
nice
summer
beer
overalll
a
fantastic
beer
that
really
caught
me
by
surprise
i
am
definitely
going
to
recommend
to
others
who
cant
seem
to
find
a
hoppy
beer
that
they
like
good
beer
although
it
looks
slightly
like
a
urine
specimen
this
is
overall
a
good
beer
with
some
citruslemon
overtones
and
a
slight
nice
hoppy
touch
i
could
drink
this
in
the
summer
more
than
any
other
season
a
good
effort
but
should
be
adapted
to
be
a
year
round
favorite
overall
definitely
a
great
beer
overall
easy
to
drink
has
a
solid
abv
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
for
most
outdoor
occasions
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
this
on
a
day
out
fishing
going
to
the
beach
camping
the
list
could
go
on
this
beer
feels
like
it
would
still
be
fairly
good
even
after
warming
up
a
bit
happens
to
the
best
of
us
had
this
beer
before
but
wanted
to
do
a
full
review
and
se
e
where
it
stacked
up
love
the
look
of
this
beer
murky
nice
head
and
even
some
sediment
the
smell
is
great
with
the
ipa
citrus
great
flavor
it
pops
but
is
very
smooth
very
little
bitter
overall
an
outstanding
beer
that
i
hope
to
revisit
many
many
times
overall
another
great
wheat
beer
that
has
a
complimentary
hop
profile
i
sure
hope
i
can
find
this
during
the
warmer
months
because
this
screams
summer
quaffer
for
sure
this
is
a
hybrid
style
i
can
behind
the
best
of
both
worlds
recommended
o
very
tasty
brew
it
mixes
the
two
things
i
didnt
think
would
go
together
i
was
wrong
this
really
works
worth
looking
for
this
is
a
very
good
go
to
beer
poured
into
weiss
glass
from
bottle
cloudy
yellow
color
white
foamy
head
lemon
on
the
nose
good
acidity
in
the
mouth
one
of
my
favorite
hoppy
wheats
i
will
drink
this
anytime
i
hate
that
everybody
says
its
almost
the
same
as
gumballhead
ok
its
also
a
hoppy
wheat
beer
and
it
has
citrus
flavors
but
lemons
dont
taste
like
oranges
really
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
overall
not
a
bad
wheat
just
a
bit
to
bland
and
a
touch
flawed
to
me
good
one
and
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
i
like
wheat
beers
and
i
like
hops
this
is
very
good
maybe
a
little
to
much
lemon
and
not
enough
hops
still
very
good
and
very
unique
enjoy
very
hoppy
and
very
flavorful
no
bitter
aftertaste
finishes
like
a
wheat
beer
very
smooth
begins
like
an
ipa
with
a
very
hoppy
taste
i
cant
get
over
how
this
beer
has
the
perfect
blend
of
hops
in
my
opinion
every
time
i
have
a
bottle
it
shocks
how
everything
in
80
acre
balances
so
well
together
im
jonesing
for
another
red
tractor
six
pack
while
writing
this
created
my
account
just
to
say
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
big
deal
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
light
beer
enjoy
o
great
product
here
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
ton
of
flavor
could
easily
drink
several
in
noe
sitting
and
not
get
tired
of
it
overall
a
nice
version
of
a
lighter
pale
wheat
ale
i
would
have
liked
to
have
had
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
hops
but
all
in
all
a
nice
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
as
promised
the
biscuit
malts
and
wheat
are
quickly
overtaken
by
the
hop
presence
that
end
clean
and
almost
dry
a
really
nice
brew
even
a
month
after
i
wasnt
supposed
to
drink
it
overall
solid
beer
and
for
the
price
worth
a
look
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
boulevard
its
so
good
that
if
they
replaced
their
standard
wheat
beer
with
this
one
i
wouldnt
be
the
slightest
bit
upset
although
i
speculate
that
there
are
others
who
would
be
in
terms
of
comparison
to
other
hoppy
wheat
beers
this
one
holds
its
own
just
fine
and
unlike
some
others
this
one
manages
to
remain
a
wheat
beer
with
hops
rather
than
tasting
like
an
ipa
with
some
wheat
in
the
grain
bill
great
nose
for
starters
lacing
holds
up
nicely
and
there
is
a
good
medium
mouthfeel
probably
one
of
my
favorite
year
round
regular
rotation
boulevard
offerings
pick
this
up
and
give
it
a
try
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
beer
it
has
lots
of
hoppy
flavor
but
not
overly
bitter
the
wheat
base
renders
the
beer
very
smooth
this
is
a
very
good
wheat
pale
ale
mouthfeel
is
good
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
crisp
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
almost
nectary
seriously
i
love
the
way
this
one
flows
pours
out
a
nice
lemony
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
with
decent
retention
smell
is
nice
fruity
orange
with
a
little
sweet
malts
in
the
background
to
balance
things
out
fairly
well
taste
is
quite
quite
malty
that
reminds
me
of
a
little
sweet
syrup
with
a
little
belgian
yeast
not
too
much
but
a
tiny
but
of
bananas
the
hop
bill
is
quite
subdued
but
helps
balance
things
out
to
some
extent
this
is
a
malt
forward
beer
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
for
the
style
due
to
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
good
one
its
just
sort
of
ok
i
like
their
smokestack
series
their
normal
beer
is
just
a
not
that
great
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
hops
juicy
citrus
easy
to
drink
have
had
it
a
few
times
and
keep
going
back
not
always
the
biggest
fan
of
boulevard
beers
but
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
their
line
up
that
i
have
had
great
take
on
easy
drinking
wheat
vs
hop
character
more
please
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
a
good
twist
on
the
classic
american
wheat
i
really
liked
the
combination
of
the
crisp
lemoncitrus
hops
combined
with
the
smooth
wheat
malts
makes
for
easy
fun
drinking
though
its
lacking
a
final
oomf
to
make
it
truly
fantastic
recommended
cloudy

with

a

decent

crisp

overall
is
crisp
refreshing
and
enjoyable
if
not
fantastic
overall
a
bit
too
lemony
for
my
taste
buds
i
almost
find
myself
puckering
from
the
tanginess
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
nevertheless
overall
lacks
some
of
the
characteristics
of
a
good
wheat
nevertheless
a
good
warm
weather
beer
with
some
nuance
overall
a
nice
suprise
not
sure
how
i
would
feel
about
one
say
a
month
from
bottling
date
since
i
enjoyed
the
balance
immensely
so
much
that
i
grabbed
another
one
from
the
fridge
very
good

it

is
really

and
a
bit

wheaty
character
with

this
is

pretty

a

with
a
distinct

on
the
lemon
citrus
and
a
deft
hand
with
hopping
the
lemon
is
so
dominant
that
this
seems
almost
to
veer
off
into
fruitmaltbeverage
territory
but
the
quality
of
the
wheat
body
and
citrus
hops
carry
through
for
a
pleasant
wheat
ale
experience
light
and
refreshing
poured
a
cloudy
light
yellow
with
good
fizzy
head
that
dies
slow
with
little
head
retention
i
pick
up
mostly
typical
yeast
and
orangey
citric
notes
with
minimal
spice
and
not
much
else
no
large
amounts
of
hops
or
sweet
malts
tastemouthfeel
seem
to
be
opposite
of
nose
as
i
get
a
smooth
filling
body
yeast
that
is
citric
hop
laden
and
has
some
sweet
malts
and
not
much
in
terms
of
spice
or
sharp
citric
notes
one
might
associate
with
a
wheat
ale
it
is
balance
and
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
so
overall
i
have
to
say
this
experiment
worked
hazy
light
straw
yellow
colored
an
inch
of
foam
caps
the
top
of
this
beer
aroma
of
wheat
and
faint
grapefruit
like
hops
greets
me
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
crisp
the
front
of
the
palate
is
grapefruit
like
hops
i
would
describe
this
as
a
session
ipa
with
wheat
light
crisp
and
refreshing
o
excellent
hopped
up
wheat
loved
the
aroma
nice
use
of
hops
to
create
a
fresh
and
balanced
flavor
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
has
just
enough
hop
character
to
be
enjoyable
but
not
overpowering
while
i
am
not
a
fan
of
hoppy
beers
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
taste
is
grassy
and
citrus
lemon
hops
with
a
nice
wheaty
backbone
a
little
thin
but
overall
a
great
refreshing
brew
i
like
oberon
a
bit
more
when
comparing
the
style
ive
had
this
both
on
tap
and
in
bottle
and
as
one
would
expect
i
liked
the
draft
version
better
extremely
drinkable
and
pretty
nice
mouthfeel
a
bit
mild
in
flavors
not
a
lot
of
banana
but
still
reasonably
enjoyable
comes
up
a
bit
short
from
boulevards
other
offerings
o
not
a
big
fan
and
tastes
like
it
could
use
some
revisions
reminds
me
of
a
soso
homebrew
version
of
gumballhead
no
nuance
or
complexity
just
hits
you
over
the
head
with
a
couple
of
of
hops
flavors
without
much
else
overall
i
like
80
acre
and
have
bought
it
more
than
once
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
saw
hoppy
and
boulevard
and
tried
it
without
remorse
this
is
a
nice
one
to
convert
macrodrinkers
with
o
infinitely
drinkable
and
just
downright
fantastic
not
typically
a
fan
of
wheat
ipas
but
this
one
sold
me
great
flavor
profile
very
sessionable
would
definitely
get
this
again
the
beer
is
hazy
and
yellow
with
a
half
inch
of
pure
white
head
aromas
of
citrus
fruits
wheat
fresh
hops
refreshing
and
delicious
the
wheat
and
big
hop
character
work
so
well
together
a
great
summer
beer
light
in
body
and
easy
drinking
it
would
be
easy
to
toss
back
a
few
pints
of
this
o
this
beer
was
just
to
drink
in
my
hotel
in
chicago
but
was
so
good
i
had
to
bring
some
home
with
me
it
makes
a
great
session
beer
bill
boulevard
80

o
pretty
good
wheat
beer
definitely
more
of
a
wheat
ale
than
hop
forward
beer
with
wheat
the
wheat
really
shines
in
the
flavor
this
is
my
favorite
of
boulevards
regular
beers
good
mix
of
citrusy
juicy
hops
and
classic
american
wheat
aromasflavors
easy
drinking
overall
this
has
a
similar
profile
as
its
unfiltered
wheat
stable
mate
but
far
more
interesting
and
satisfying
on
all
counts
the
hops
are
an
awesome
addition
making
this
a
must
buy
for
the
summer
months
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
has
a
slightly
hoppy
wheat
aroma
hints
of
citrus
slight
hoppiness
with
a
wheat
flavor
bready
slight
citrus
at
the
end
with
a
mild
hoppy
aftertaste
slightly
soapy
good
beer
but
it
does
seem
to
be
missing
something
a
perfect
summer
session
beer
light
and
crisp
yet
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
perfectly
balanced
o
seriously
delicious
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
in
6packs
i
think
that
this
is
a
good
beer
but
that
fact
that
its
five
months
past
its
best
by
date
has
probably
affected
the
quality
of
this
beer
still
ill
probably
pick
up
a
stronger
batch
later
on
a
great
american
wheat
ale
one
may
expect
from
the
midwest
with
the
american
aka
hop
twist
its
a
touch
of
midwest
meets
california
poured
into
a
nonic
a
hazed
lemony
color
with
a
fluffy
one
finger
bones
white
head
atop
aromas
of
toasted
wheat
and
light
citric
hopsthe
aromaes
underwhelmed
me
a
little
anice
low
carbonated
feel
to
the
beertoasted
with
that
tinge
of
iron
on
the
palate
with
a
smack
of
citric
hops
to
save
the
day
in
the
finish
with
a
good
shot
of
hops
i
could
see
myself
driniking
this
on
a
humid
summer
day
and
being
satisfied
with
it
o
nice
hoppy
wheat
ale
a
goto
for
the
style
o
the
more
i
have
from
boulevard
the
more
i
grow
to
like
them
when
done
right
this
is
a
style
i
really
enjoy
and
this
beer
in
particular
is
a
success
id
gladly
make
this
a
regular
in
my
fridge
ok
boulevard
you
sneaked
this
one
under
my
radar
i
had
tried
the
unfiltered
wheat
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
but
plain
so
i
thought
i
would
give
this
a
shot
this
is
a
great
clean
refreshing
summer
beer
hands
down
the
fruity
hops
are
delivered
in
a
light
carbonated
hazy
brew
that
screams
summertime
to
me
this
reminded
me
of
a
lighter
snappier
version
of
little
sumpin
sumpin
or
gumballheadsame
general
hop
profile
but
significantly
lighter
with
not
as
much
hop
aftertaste
the
hop
burps
are
also
not
nearly
as
concentrated
again
a
fine
thirst
quenching
summer
offering
that
i
will
enjoy
often
good
job
boulevard
o
im
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
and
be
a
happy
man
perfect
for
these
hot
summer
days
they
nailed
it
overall
not
bad
the
body
was
nice
full
smooth
and
with
a
clean
finish
drinkability
was
good
id
maybe
have
a
few
at
a
cookout
overall
a
pleasant
enough
brew
not
one
that
stands
out
but
probably
a
decent
choice
for
refreshment
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
80
acre
hoppy
wheat
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
large
frothy
head
there
is
a
dry
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
has
a
nice
pale
and
wheat
like
flavors
with
hints
of
hops
to
finish
the
taste
good
flavors
refreshing
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
and
was
slightly
watery
overall
however
this
is
a
very
nice
hoppier
wheat
style
beer
o
this
one
hits
all
of
my
buttons
for
a
summer
brew
easy
drinking
fairly
low
abv
and
looks
great
in
the
glass
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
a
thick
dense
white
head
that
remains
until
the
finish
a
tangerine
and
grassy
hop
aroma
it
has
a
nice
wheat
flavor
with
citrus
and
grassy
hop
notes
finishes
very
smooth
with
a
bit
of
tartness
and
a
lingering
grassy
hop
flavor
a
great
light
summer
beer
o
i
really
enjoy
both
hoppy
beers
and
wheat
beers
so
this
combination
really
worked
for
me
easy
to
drink
enjoyable
and
sessionable
hazy
golden
colored
body
a
poofy
lumpy
head
sits
atop
leaving
behind
some
thick
lacing
aromas
are
initially
floral
hops
before
turning
super
juicy
and
bright
freshly
squeezed
oj
lemon
and
other
citrus
surrounding
a
subtle
biscuity
wheat
note
pleasant
gentle
hop
flavors
lemon
tea
wheat
mellow
citrus
juice
and
a
floral
sweetness
drying
in
the
finish
fluffy
light
and
crisp
i
had
one
while
grilling
and
i
imagine
thats
a
perfect
situation
for
drinking
this
beer
o
summer
beer
for
sure
wheats
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
does
a
nice
combo
of
an
ipa
and
a
wheat
nose
was
the
star
of
the
show
however
would
make
a
great
warm
weather
brew
fur
shur
this
is
a
nice
wheat
beer
and
it
is
indeed
hoppy
but
the
i
prefer
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
my
hops
this
was
about
as
much
citrus
as
you
could
possibly
get
out
hops
in
the
end
it
wasnt
bad
but
for
something
claiming
to
be
a
hoppy
wheat
beer

so
of

i
like
it
but
this
is
more
than
just

this
the
way
it
is
boulevards

is
an

that

be
bottled

sold
do
it

a
mild
refreshing
wheat
ale
a
full
but
delicate
flavor
makes
it
better
to
have
early
in
a
meal
or
just
as
a
refresher
during
the
day
refreshing
and
light
hazy
orange
highly
carbonated
coming
out
of
the
12
oz
bottle
but
the
foam
dies
off
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
a
very
mild
aroma
hints
of
citrus
honey
coriander
which
are
evident
in
the
taste
as
well
the
taste
is
mild
smooth
but
the
flavor
is
easily
overwhelmed
by
food
to
me
this
is
best
for
refreshment
not
to
pair
with
a
meal
interesting
and
worth
trying
as
a
six
pack
before
going
in
for
a
case
would
be
an
amazing
beer
if
it
were
warm
outside
o
decent
offering
good
late
summer
beer
cheers
a
good
drinkable
summer
beer
that
you
can
serve
to
a
wide
range
of
people
overall
an
alright
and
rather
crisp
brew
but
really
nothing
that
is
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
i
love
a
great
wheat
beer
and
this
one
is
a
pretty
good
one
overall
it
isnt
the
greatest
i
have
ever
tried
but
there
is
enough
artisan
craftsmanship
and
good
taste
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
overall
definitely
great
for
summer
it
is
a
great
choice
if
you
want
a
wheat
beer
similar
to
blue
moon
but
want
to
switch
it
up
i
really
enjoy
showing
this
beer
to
people
who
like
oberon
which
is
how
it
was
presented
to
me
as
well
i
think
the
flavor
components
are
very
similar
so
it
is
an
easy
transition
but
to
me
this
as
a
slightly
sharper
flavor
which
i
tend
to
enjoy
poured
into
a
pint
glass
o
overall
a
decent
beer
and
would
seek
it
out
and
drink
again
tastefeel
also
refreshing
with
plenty
of
citrus
and
grain
reasonably
high
carbonation
to
help
with
that
yes
im
using
the
word
again
refreshing
flavorfeel
theres
a
solid
amount
of
orange
and
orange
peel
sort
of
oilbitterness
in
this
brew
but
yet
it
never
becomes
overwhelming
surprised
the
alcohol
is
6
2
as
it
feels
like
an
even
5
but
whats
an
extra
percent
anyway
id
gladly
have
another
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
complexityi
didnt
get
any
of
the
coriander
or
spices
in
the
taste
o
this
is
a
nice
wheat
ale
that
has
good
flavor
and
balance
this
could
make
a
nice
session
ale
in
the
summer
months
a
spicy
witbier
with
rindy
orange
notes
and
some
lingering
grassiness
from
the
malts
boozier
and
crispier
than
one
would
expect
but
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
an
easy
to
drink
summer
beer
but
for
me
it
falls
behind
oberon
in
terms
of
taste
and
smell
o
i
think
this
falls
short
of
the
wheat
style
i
think
they
tried
to
find
a
mix
between
a
wit
and
oberon
lacks
a
lot
of
character
both
of
those
styles
exhibit

that

again
on

dry
beer
for
a
6
abv
wheat
beer
flavors
are
not
offputing
but
could
use
something
to
distinguish
from
the
graininess
overall
quite
a
strange
wheat
beer
with
little
wheat
taste
if
they
toned
that
up
a
bit
i
believe
it
would
make
for
a
great
witbier
still
not
bad
though
83
b
onot
too
bad
not
great
to
me
either
i
just
cant
get
past
the
floaters
in
the
beer
the
body
is
good
light
enough
for
summer
and
hot
weather
but
verging
on
medium
with
good
level
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
crispness
the
smoothness
underneath
adds
to
the
enjoyment
overall
it
was
a
little
spicier
than
i
was
hoping
for
but
its
still
good
seems
more
like
a
witbier
in
my
opinion
this
is
actually
an
excellent
pale
wheat
ale
and
the
fact
its
in
cans
makes
me
even
more
ready
to
pick
up
another
sixer
perfect
fishin
beer
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
pretty
average
example
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
the
heavy
honey
aspect
that
makes
this
beer
lack
the
balance
that
comes
with
a
good
american
pale
wheat
ale
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
smooth
but
the
flavor
couldnt
hold
my
attention
so
one
is
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
looked
nice
and
i
thought
the
color
was
really
good
looking
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
heavy
honey
aspect
that
seemed
out
of
place
in
this
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
much
rather
have
an
oberon
i
would
tell
someone
to
drink
an
oberon
instead
of
this
beer
its
a
much
better
example
of
the
style
this
was
another
underwhelming
beer
for
arcadia
it
seems
like
they
can
make
some
pretty
good
dark
beers
but
i
havent
been
impressed
with
most
of
their
lighter
beers
i
had
this
beer
side
by
side
with
oberon
and
oberon
was
pretty
much
better
in
every
aspect
it
is
much
more
fitting
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
in
michigan
i
think
i
may
have
liked
this
better
before
the
recipe
change
the
honey
is
too
dominant
this
beer
needs
another
recipe
change
and
they
can
start
with
cutting
out
a
lot
of
that
honey
better
luck
next
time

a
bit
too
old
but
lets
give
it
a
shot
pours
to
instant
head
after
a
loud
release
of
carbonation
upon
openingno
gusher
though
eventually
turns
out
to
be
a
hazy
and
cloudy
deep
orange
color
with
a
dense
and
fluffy
23
finger
off
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thick
cap
that
lingers
some
slight
bits
of
lacing
cling
to
the
glass
the
yeast
seems
to
have
clumped
up
and
is
floating
around
in
the
glass
like
bits
of
ground
pepper
aromas
of
orange
peel
lemon
coriander
light
pepper
bread
and
not
much
else
pretty
weak
aromas
without
much
complexity
but
not
offensive
taste
of
orange
peel
pepper
coriander
wheat
spicy
yeast
and
breadiness
some
lingering
notes
of
bread
wheat
orange
and
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
medium
body
and
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
drinks
very
smoothly
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
other
than
the
grainy
appearance
and
weak
aromas
this
was
pretty
solid
stuff
good
balance
of
flavors
and
easy
drinking
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orangish
color
it
has
about
a
finger
of
white
head
on
it
the
head
doesnt
have
the
best
retention
and
it
leaves
behind
just
a
little
bit
of
scattered
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
good
amount
of
wheat
and
lemony
city
aromas
there
are
also
some
scents
of
oranges
spice
and
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
presence
the
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
it
starts
off
with
some
grainy
malt
and
wheat
there
are
some
bright
fruit
flavors
and
just
a
little
bit
of
hop
flavor
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
lemony
citrus
mostly
on
the
back
end
the
finish
leaves
some
lingering
wheat
spice
and
citrus
on
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
decent
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
smooth
feel
to
it
it
has
a
refreshing
quality
to
it
and
there
is
some
graininess
as
well
this
has
decent
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
just
doesnt
stand
up
to
a
lot
of
the
witbiers
that
ive
had
i
think
it
is
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
too
much
out
of
it
thanks
to
the
legend
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
oranges
and
spices
taste
is
very
flavorful
oranges
spices
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
quality
beer
o
nothing
special
pretty
simple
wheaty
beer
not
unlike
a
blue
moon
o
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
i
wasnt
really
disappointed
either
there
are
better
renditions
of
this
style
but
it
came
in
a
sampler
pack
with
other
beers
that
i
know
i
like
soso
overall
maybe
i
would
like
this
better
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
i
did
not
really
connect
with
this
beer
the
flavor
is
ok
but
the
mouthfeel
is
not
that
good
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
54
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
slight
honey
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
orange
and
a
hint
of
hop
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
honey
hint
of
wheat
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
hops
overall
great
appearance
but
lacking
in
aroma
and
body
overall
impression
going
in
for
the
smell
it
started
off
like
it
was
going
to
be
a
killer
summer
beer
this
all
changed
after
the
taste
not
enough
body
and
the
orange
flavor
almost
never
came
up
either
way
im
going
to
be
sticking
to
my
wheach
when
i
want
a
great
refreshing
brew
for
the
summer
wouldnt
mind
trying
this
one
ontap
though
this
beer
is
kind
of
different
its
nice
but
nothing
special
at
all
something
is
off
in
the
flavors
which
really
hurts
its
definitely
something
appropriate
for
the
warmer
weather
and
i
will
admit
the
more
i
sip
the
more
i
enjoy
but
its
still
flawed
o
i
enjoyed
just
sipping
this
during
a
football
game
pleasant
and
a
bit
of
good
complexity
overall
the
sourness
should
have
been
stronger
i
didnt
really
get
this
beer
and
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
the
taste
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
is
in
the
foreground
and
the
taste
of
beer
is
in
the
distant
background
the
effect
was
like
drinking
cold
herbal
tea
in
a
glass
that
was
unwashed
since
someone
drank
beer
out
of
it
when
i
first
poured
it
into
a
glass
i
had
high
expectations
its
colorful
in
a
glass
i
normally
have
a
high
opinion
of
arcadia
ales
due
to
sky
high
rye
and
i
suppose
i
can
give
them
credit
for
trying
to
be
experimental
with
an
offering
such
as
whitsun
i
understand
they
may
have
wanted
to
give
the
center
stage
to
coriander
and
orange
peel
but
i
would
preferred
that
stage
to
be
shared
with
some
bold
hops
overall
wont
become
anyones
favorite
but
this
is
a
great
little
easy
drinking
summer
ale
with
a
decent
amount
of
strength
and
at
8
50
for
six
12oz
cans
its
perfect
for
hiking
boating
or
other
summer
excursions
solid
beer
o
this
is
a
very
nice
white
beer
i
think
the
citrus
comes
out
a
bit
more
than
the
spices
but
still
having
this
from
a
can
on
a
hot
day
is
great
many
thanks
to
gordianknot
for
the
chance
to
taste
this
one
never
heard
of
this
beer
but
always
dig
craft
in
a
can
poured
from
can
into
my
brooklyn
tulip
pours
a
murky
orange
color
crazy
thick
milky
head
nice
retention
smell
orange
juice
from
concentrate
something
like
minute
maid
some
lactose
flavors
creamy
maybe
a
hint
of
nutmeg
spice
taste
there
is
that
orange
juice
concentrate
flavor
but
it
is
at
the
back
of
the
throat
just
a
little
astringent
on
the
front
of
the
mouth
it
is
nice
and
refreshing
light
and
airy
flavors
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
any
wit
i
have
ever
had
i
would
have
expected
more
citrus
more
spice
more
coriander
etc
but
there
is
some
individuality
going
on
here
that
i
can
really
appreciate
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
see
drinking
on
a
hot
summer
day
quite
often
esp
because
it
is
canned
o
not
at
all
what
i
thought
or
wanted
it
to
be
i
poured
it
out
not
because
i
couldnt
finish
it
i
just
didnt
want
to
not
refreshing
crisp
flavorful
anything
sad
day
it
seems
light
bodied
as
it
goes
down
so
quickly
and
easily
it
definitely
dries
your
tongue
out
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
a
quick
but
pleasant
drink
my
only
gripe
is
that
is
goes
so
quickly
nice
enough
nothing
to
write
home
about
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
a
summer
staple
for
me
if
i
could
get
is
regularly
in
my
area
the
crack
glug
was
music
to
my
ears
and
as
the
two
fingers
of
eggshellwhite
head
began
to
form
the
room
filled
with
the
scent
of
orange
zest
drool
the
color
was
a
very
cloudy
orangishamber
the
nose
was
definitely
orange
peelzest
but
underlain
by
the
spiciness
of
the
coriander
and
the
unmistakable
lightness
of
no
not
being
that
is
unbearable
but
instead
wheat
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thin
which
is
not
unusual
in
wheat
beers
and
the
immediate
flavors
were
of
the
corianders
spiciness
and
the
zestiness
of
the
orange
peel
followed
by
the
sharp
tartness
of
the
wheat
this
was
a
beer
whose
principal
ingredients
really
worked
well
together
and
were
exactly
as
advertised
finish
was
light
dry
refreshing
and
perfect
for
yet
another
slow
summer
day
i
would
absolutely
put
this
in
my
cooler
certainly
during
the
summer
but
also
as
a
nice
pickmeup
on
hula
in
the
coola
day
01
feb
annually
o
at
6
abv
its
got
some
kick
but
its
not
a
great
beer
however
its
one
id
like
to
try
again
pours
a
hazed
honeyamber
many
chunks
of
stuff
floating
around
perhaps
i
poured
too
hard
much
yeast
sludge
in
bottom
of
bottle
an
offwhite
head
rings
up
and
sticks
the
smell
is
coriander
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
a
whopping
smack
of
coriander
seriously
tons
of
flavor
in
this
brew
i
detect
some
honey
the
orange
peel
comes
through
afterward
intense
as
well
cant
help
but
feel
tart
thick
like
oj
a
good
drinker
due
to
the
supposed
ingredient
generosity
nice
ale
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
duvel
tulip
murky
brown
unfiltered
color
and
a
white
frothy
head
due
to
the
awesome
glass
and
aggressive
pour
nose
of
citrus
and
spice
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
slightly
more
flavorful
than
your
average
wheat
based
brew
interesting
mouthfeel
on
the
heavy
side
of
refreshing
would
drink
again
o
overall
a
bit
of
a
lack
luster
no
real
stand
out
qualities
but
still
a
decent
brew
refreshing
out
of
the
can
tasted
good
floating
down
the
river
in
a
kayak
a
bit
higher
abv
for
style
is
a
plus
beer
is
light
in
flavor
and
light
in
body
light
in
color
and
light
in
soul
there
is
a
mild
doughiness
to
this
beer
but
overall
an
unoffensive
but
boring
beer
medium
bodied
pretty
soft
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
pretty
refreshing
brew
although
a
little
light
on
flavor
overall
skip
this
one
light
bodied
with
little
carbonation
this
beer
has
an
odd
slick
consistency
it
is
definitely
very
drinkable
but
the
lack
of
carbonation
allows
the
flavors
to
persist
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
for
far
too
long
this
does
not
measure
up
to
a
wheat
beer
that
is
marketed
for
springsummer
consumption
the
flavor
is
somewhat
astringent
almost
like
an
average
quality
homebrew
the
label
gives
this
beer
too
much
hype
i
e
honey
corriander
orange
peel
didnt
get
any
of
these
flavors
coming
through
i
think
it
should
be
filtered
to
showcase
the
ingredient
profile
certainly
worth
a
try
a
very
nice
offering
from
arcadia
im
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
constantly
on
blistering
hot
sunny
days
very
refreshing
im
ready
for
summer
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
normal
pint
glass
and
looked
at
the
color
of
it
it
seems
to
be
rather
clear
for
a
wheat
ale
the
head
was
pretty
nice
and
fluffy
the
smell
was
lacking
some
of
the
wheat
ale
elements
like
clove
and
soft
fruits
i
felt
that
the
mouthfeel
was
about
right
but
still
nothing
to
rave
about
the
flavor
was
kind
of
on
the
weak
side
i
was
surprised
because
its
a
stronger
abv
for
a
beer
of
this
style
not
sure
why
but
i
was
struggling
with
this
one
drinkability
a
crisp
and
refreshing
wheat
beer
that
can
almost
make
me
think
the
warm
weather
is
here
to
stay
not
sure
how
available
this
is
even
though
i
am
only
one
state
away
but
i
wouldnt
be
against
having
it
again
d
i
always
find
this
style
very
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
is
good
light
and
simple
enough
that
before
you
know
it
youve
have
a
6
pack
great
for
the
summer
d
good
could
be
a
great
summer
bbq
beer
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
a
lot
of
it
but
knocking
a
few
back
in
an
afternoon
wouldnt
be
bad
pours
pale
amber
with
no
head
aroma
of
lemon
bubblegum
and
citrus
flavors
of
coriander
lemon
spice
and
spiced
fruit
light
in
body
with
high
carbonation
that
zaps
the
palate
the
spices
reign
dominant
over
the
other
flavors
and
can
irritate
after
a
while
future
outlook
decent
interesting
variation
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
this
as
i
seem
to
recall
is
one
of
arcadias
masterpieces
and
it
has
stuck
around
for
good
reason
definitely
a
good
endofsummer
beer
in
my
opinion
something
that
hearkens
to
fruit
beer
but
dabbles
in
earthy
tones
as
well
i
like
it
d
this
beer
was
a
nice
sipper
during
a
warm
summer
day
i
couldnt
even
begin
to
tell
you
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
beer
oh
well
keep
this
one
coming
arcadia
decent
drinkability
not
a
chugger
not
a
sipper
interesting
beer
overall
no
off
flavors
but
the
carpet
doesnt
seem
to
match
the
drapes
smell
is
a
pleasant
bittersweet
combination
of
orange
and
wheat
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
some
fizz
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
american
wheat
which
i
dont
usually
like
with
distinct
orange
elements
and
a
refreshing
hop
coriander
aftertaste
surprisingly
fullbodied
for
a
wheat
beer
higher
abv
than
most
but
not
at
all
heavy
this
is
extremely
drinkable
on
a
hot
summers
day
and
unlike
most
beers
i
dont
get
tired
of
the
flavors
at
all
pours
medium
gold
with
slight
haze
rather
small
head
forms
with
creamy
texture
and
large
bubbles
interspersed
the
head

appealing

rather
spotty

perhaps
some

a

a

mouthfeel
with
a
dry
orange
juice
like
aftertaste
almost
feels
like
oj
poured
into
a
wheat
ale
and
decent
spices
that
stand
out
the
body
is
medium
light
with
decent
carbonation
its
a
little
syrupy
but
to
be
expected
given
the
honey
additions
i
liked
it
more
than
i
thought
i
might
but
the
sweetness
is
a
touch
excessive
it
starts
as
exuberance
and
fades
slowly
into
being
overdone
d
a
great
summery
brew
one
that
i
will
buy
again
trying
to
taste
as
many

with

not
memorable
d
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
for
a
good
hot
summer
day
beer
but
it
is
a
good
alternative
to
the
big
daddy

kind
of
a
dark
copper
tone
slightly
cloudy
with
a
fast
fizzing
white
head
a
decent
amount
of

sediment
that
pick
up
easily
off

nothing
seems
to
be
settling
in

only
after
about
five
minutes
does
the
cloud
reach
the
bottom
of
the

fruity
and
spicy
guided
by
an
english
malt
sent
taste
is
much
the
same
very
bready
feels
tart
and
a
little
bitter
naot
a
bad
beer
cheers
i
like
this
beer
i
much
prefer
this
as
a
summer
beer
than
the
lighter
crisper
stuff
with
less
body
a
beerdrinkers
summer
brew
something
like
that
recommended
it
has
a
strong
alcohol
aroma
with
a
citrus
finish
almost
like
orange
bourbon
it
has
a
darker
body
than
most
wits
and
it
is
extremely
smooth
a
slightly
heavier
body
than
most
wits
too
the
flavor
is
grainy
and
orange
like
there
are
also
some
lemon
like
flavors
too
it
does
have
a
little
bit
of
warmth
to
it
pours
a
rich
amber
color
which
is
pleasantly
surprising
for
a
wheat
beer
aroma
is
sweet
and
sour
candy
apple
a
little
spicy
and
a
touch
of
bubble
gum
the
flavor
for
me
is
a
little
too
sweet
cloying
there
is
an
orange
peal
bitterness
that
im
just
not
digging
there
is
a
good
bit
of
hop
bitterness
as
well
thats
not
working
for
me
in
the
flavor
as
well
arcadia
is
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
michigan
but
i
just
dont
like
this
particular
offering
cheers
the
taste
is
definitely
fruity
with
that
silly
berry
aroma
coming
into
play
in
the
taste
there
is
also
a
slight
taut
citrus
flavor
some
abv
in
the
background
a
lousy
aftertaste
oh
this
beer
is
a
mess
not
good
down
the
drain
it
goes
notes
arcadia
never
did
impress
me
too
much
their
jaw
jacker
was
probably
their
best
that
i
have
sampled
but
many
of
their
other
beers
and
i
am
afraid
this
one
is
included
were
pedestrian
hazy
dirty
dirty
orangegold
color
reminds
me
of
home
made
apple
cider
some
fair
sized
yeasties
floating
around
hint
of
citrus
in
the
smell
along
with
some
banana
and
caramel
i
also
get
a
slight
darkdried
fruit
note
taste
is
similiar
but
the
banana
and
dark
fruit
is
replaced
by
a
spicy
honey
and
a
hint
of
apricot
more
malty
sweetness
than
i
was
expecting
i
was
somewhat
taken
aback
at
first
but
the
taste
really
grew
on
me
as
i
went
through
the
beer
seemed
to
me
to
have
quite
a
bit
of
belgian
influence
apricot
and
orange
colours
hazy
two
tone
with
the
bottom
half
noticeably
darker
fleeting
offwhite
head
soon
disappeared
very
flat
appearance
like
fresh
squeezed
juice
smell
of
critus
tangerine
some
sweetness
marmalade
hops
were
muted
this
beer
had
pronounced
malty
backbone
with
a
bit
of
sour
fruit
earthy
at
times
i
wondered
if
the
flat
impressions
meant
the
bottle
had
been
in
the
singles
bin
a
bit
too
long
regardless
nice
drinking
sessional
goes
well
this
time
of
year
like
to
try
this
fresher
sometime
d
i
really
like
this
beer
by
far
my
favorite
american
wheat
beer
though
the
brewery
tries
to
sell
a
story
about
this
being
a
traditional
beer
served
at
country
festivals
in
the
olden
days
of
england
it
is
delightful
now
and
that
is
what
counts
i
havent
had
this
beer
except
on
cask
and
i
havent
had
any
beers
on
cask
except
this
one
so
i
may
not
be
the
best
judge
either
way
but
in
both
accounts
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
moreys
bottom
line
decent
but
this
is
definitely
not
your
average
sessionable
summer
wheat
beer
a
little
on
the
bolder
side
pretty
low
hopped
and
sweet
for
an
apwa
but
that
works
for
me
might
be
sickly
sweet
to
others
especially
as
it
warms
taste
orange
with
some
nice
bitterness
on
the
finish
yeast
provides
the
right
amount
of
spiciness
left
with
the
aftertaste
of
honey
full
of
flavor
but
not
at
all
heavy
i
could
down
the
whole
six
pack
whilst
looking
out
at
spider
lake
this
beer
could
be
more
carbonated
pretty
drinkable
but
just
not
quite
what
a
wheat
beer
should
be
an
odd
aftertaste
i
like
my
wheat
beer
with
more
hops
but
this
seems
pretty
on
for
the
traditional
style
d
easy
to
drink
in
the
summer
nothing
overly
complex
makes
drinking
these
easy
although
this
would
not
be
my
1
choice
it
is
stil
a
decent
offering
drinkability
very
good
something
i
could
definately
drink
again
drinkability
is
ok
for
a
higher
abv
pale
wheat
but
i
would
rather
have
a
ubersun
for
high
abv
or
turn
to
a
gumballhead
or
hopsun
for
a
lower
abv
wheat
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
i
could
not
have
more
than
1
the
cardamom
is
way
to
strong
of
a
spice
and
leaves
a
aftertaste
that
i
just
dont
like
expected
more
spices
but
i
am
glad
they
werent
present
this
brew
is
amber
orange
with
a
tiny
off
white
head
no
lacing
smells
of
orange
and
lemon
peels
and
the
taste
follows
suit
with
freshly
cut
grass
added
there
are
a
few
inappropriate
hints
of
alcohol
heat
in
some
sips
also
theres
a
bit
of
maple
syrup
in
there
the
flavors
are
a
little
aggressive
for
the
style
and
i
dont
think
they
blend
as
well
as
they
could
its
kind
of
strong
in
flavor
for
a
nice
session
or
summer
beer
but
its
not
bad
in
general
light
drinkable
but
uninspired
the
mouthfeel
was
phenomenal
to
have
a
cask
conditioned
beer
is
such
a
treat
and
im
glad
my
neighborhood
bar
always
has
one
beer
on
cask
it
was
silky
smooth
and
almost
creamy
up
until
the
last
few
sips
and
even
then
it
was
pretty
smooth
there
was
certainly
carbonation
but
not
with
any
kind
of
bite
whether
it
was
the
beer
or
the
serving
type
i
dont
know
but
this
beer
was
outstanding
if
it
werent
a
bit
pricey
id
down
them
all
night
every
night
until
the
cask
runs
out
very
refreshing
d
very
cool
how
you
stumble
upon
a
new
favorite
beer
thought
this
was
a
wit
but
to
my
pleasant
surprise
was
not
very
nice
drinker
lots
of
character
d
it
is
not
hot
yet
but
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
beer
during
the
summer
d
really
nice
and
tasty
warmweather
wheat
ale
with
lots
of
citrus
flavor
this
was
definitely
ewasy
to
put
down
drinkability
american
pale
wheat
ales
tend
to
be
pretty
bad
but
this
one
isnt
its
a
drinkable
accessible
wheat
beer
its
probably
meant
to
be
competition
for
bells
oberon
and
its
hitting
in
the
same
ball
park
very
intense
strong
taste
has
a
citruswheat
taste
mixed
with
almost
grape
aftertaste
weird
but
good
very
sweet
very
unique
i
didnt
love
it
but
appreciated
how
different
it
was
d
not
really
my
style
but
i
could
see
a
fan
of
the
style
knocking
these
out
in
the
summertime
a
fine
beer
this
would
go
much
better
in
the
summer
heat
than
in
the
winter
cold
have
to
try
a
sixer
next
summer
by
the
pool
d
ill
admit
i
expected
a
belgian
style
wit
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
more
interesting
american
wheats
ive
had
the
tartness
is
very
odd
and
seems
out
of
style
if
you
are
looking
for
a
refreshing
wheat
look
elsewhere
this
isnt
bad
but
definitely
not
on
par
with
other
arcadia
brews
that
said
i
enjoyed
some
aspects
of
the
flavor
and
the
aroma
this
is
a
brew
that
is
designed
to
be
drunk
in
the
warmer
months
not
bad
just
needs
a
touch
more
flavor
cloudy
orange
pour
with
small
white
head
sort
of
an
odd
aromalike
old
ripe
appleorangemaybe
some
spiceflavor
was
much
the
same
for
mekind
of
an
old
fruit
flavor
with
some
odd
yeast
notes
i
sampled
this
twiceand
came
up
with
the
same
thing
each
timejust
something
here
i
am
not
liking
much
arcadia
has
much
better
products
than
this
one
sorry
just
not

notes

drinkability
i
prefer
a
more
traditional
wheat
ill
finish
it
but
i
find
it
a
little
too
harsh
for
my
taste
dthis
is
a
great
american
wheat
beer
alot
of
really
nicewell
developed
flavors
maybe
too
much
alcohol
for
a
session
but
a
great
summer
bbq
beer
none
the
less
this
beer
pours
out
a
golden
amber
color
very
little
of
the
fizzy
white
head
made
an
appearance
but
what
was
there
left
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
smell
was
somewhat
malty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
was
pretty
good
the
malts
made
an
appearance
along
with
hops
very
pleasing
overall
beer
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
was
pretty
smooth
i
would
definitely
drink
another
one
of
these
and
could
have
easily
had
a
couple
more
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
right
afterwards
d
a
nice
combination
of
mouthfeel
and
taste
makes
this
brew
a
nice
summer
beer
definitely
easy
drinking
and
rather
refreshing
pretty
nice
beer
here
nothing
over
the
top
yet
nothing
to
knock
on
either
its
a
solid
summer
quaffer
with
flavors
that
meld
well
to
bring
together
a
nice
sessionable
brew
this
may
rank
in
at
number
four
for
my
favorite
readily
attainable
apwas
this
beer
was
a
nice
cloudy
copper
colored
pour
it
seems
to
be
trying
to
be
everything
tastewise
sweet
spicy
orangecitrus
sour
but
it
does
not
come
together
and
in
the
end
leaves
an
astringent
feel
in
my
mouth
one
of
several
not
very
impressive
brews
spawned
from
the
pale
wheat
ale
style
im
not
the
biggest
lush
but
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
loading
up
on
this
one
nothing
remarkable
about
this
beer
but
nothing
unsettling
either
the
pour
and
smell
are
plain
jane
very
little
head
and
no
real
smell
to
speak
of
the
taste
is
sweet
and
i
guess
thats
the
honey
coming
through
different
from
other
wheats
in
that
respect
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
doesnt
leave
you
wanting
another
mouthfeeldrinkability
feels
pretty
bubbly
and
can
sense
the
spice
before
swallowing
goes
down
smooth
not
bad
at
all
d
a
really
good
brew
i
dont
know
why
but
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
one
and
im
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
thick
rich
sweet
but
never
cloying
the
orange
fruit
freshness
keeps
this
firmly
planted
in
the
sessionable
category
a
really
nice
beer
whitsun
pours
a
deep
orange
color
beneath
a
short
head
of
fleeting
white
foam
the
nose
is
yeasty
fruity
and
malty
delicately
caramelish
with
an
edge
of
wheat
it
has
an
almost
melonlike
aroma
perhaps
cantaloupe
and
bits
of
citrus
including
orange
in
the
mouth
its
lightmedium
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
very
fine
bubbled
effervescent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
zing
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
is
initially
a
bit
tart
adding
to
the
impression
of
fruit
flavors
earlypicked
apple
pear
white
grape
and
it
appears
very
citrusy
orange
flavors
seem
to
appear
across
the
middle
along
and
into
the
finish
and
it
lingers
in
the
mouth
with
some
sweet
orange
marmalade
and
honey
the
bitterness
is
kept
in
check
and
its
really
quite
refreshing
a
delicate
touch
of
astringency
in
the
finish
leaves
it
very
dry
and
refreshing
an
excellent
summer
brew
very
fruity
very
spritzy
d
ok
if
nothing
else
available
per
style
otherwise
just
a
moderately
average
wit
all
in
all
a
strong
flavorful
representation
of
the
style
but
not
arcadias
best
dive
enjoyed
others
from
arcadia
that
were
well
above
averagethis
one
was
a
dissapointment
for
meon
to
the
next
unusual
unique
a
fruity
wheat
ale
with
a
pinch
higher
abv
than
usual
for
style
worth
checking
out
for
a
different
spin
on
a
summer
brew
but
i
cant
say
im
crazy
about
it
a
good
straightforward
pale
wheat
fruit
and
smooth
very
drinkable
this
wont
knock
off
the
socks
but
it
should
be
easy
as
pie
to
kick
back
and
enjoy
a
few
of
these
without
thinking
twice
recommended
pours
a
foggy
amber
nose
is
slight
woody
caramel
syrupy
kind
of
character
to
it
flavor
is
tangy
in
a
wood
kind
of
way
hits
my
mouth
and
makes
me
go
eck
a
bit
more
body
than
i
would
expect
but
there
it
is
slight
bitter
tone
feel
is
thicker
on
the
liquid
with
a
decent
carbonation
i
have
an
announcement
to
make
i
hate
this
style
i
hate
it
hate
it
hate
it
i
dont
think
there
is
one
beer
of
this
style
that
i
tried
that
i
liked
okay
thats
not
true
blue
star
by
north
coast
and
white
gold
by
ithaca
were
good
but
way
different
than
the
11
others
that
i
do
not
like
at
all
but
hey
this
beer
is
overall
pretty
decent
i
guess
i
just
wouldnt
mind
never
drinking
another
pale
wheat
ale
in
my
life
except
gumballhead
dunfortunately
this
was
one
a
very
few
dumps
for
me
i
just
couldnt
finish
it
drinkability
this
is
a
good
ale
certainly
not
a
great
one
but
it
is
a
rather
unique
take
on
wheat
ales
and
something
id
enjoy
on
hot
summer
days
every
so
often
nice
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
low
on
carbonation
and
sticky
on
the
palate
decent
beer
cant
say
this
is
my
favorite
in
the
style
certainly
quaffable
but
wouldnt
be
hurt
if
this
was
the
only
one
i
tried
reflection
this
is
a
fair
wheat
beer
at
best
u
s
brewers
never
seem
to
make
them
as
well
as
they
do
overseas

glass
beer
is
a
hazy
dark
goldenyellow
color
with
a
huge
foamy

that
crackles
like
rice

in

the
smell
is
slightly
sweet
primarily
pale

a
spicy

the
taste
starts
out

with
the

coming
to
the

maybe
a
hint
of
citrus

quickly
by
a

this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
covered
only
really
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
nothing
outstanding
but
a
very
solid
offering
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
bodied
and
higher
levels
of
carbonation
are
what
one
expects
from
this
style
and
youll
find
it
here
slight
warming
sensation
from
alcohol
also
a
semidry
finish
this
is
easy
to
drink

id
much
rather
have

hand
it
could
be
refreshing
but
theres
nothing
all
that
special
about
it
to
make
me
want
to
purchase
it
again
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
alternative
to
some
of
the
more
popular
american
wheats
it
is
a
little
sweeter
than
most
but
not
overpowering
scored
on
a
recent
visit
to
michigan
had
several
there
but
saved
one
to
take
back
for
review

nice

beer

be
smells
of
malt
and
spices
with
a
touch
of
bread
taste
is
mainly
malt
and
some
fruit
but
not
too
distinguishable
has
a
pleasant
but
strangely
dry
aftertaste
slightly
creamy
feel
to
it
although
its
not
a
great
beer
it
wasnt
hard
to
put
a
couple
away
at
a
time
while
on
vacation
worth
a
try
just
dont
expect
too
much
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
honey
aroma
i
hear
this
is
made
with
honey
the
yeast
is
right
in
the
forefront
as
usual
its
fruity
and
a
bit
stale
smelling
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
very
dry
honey
flavor
that
is
wrapped
around
a
base
of
pale
and
wheat
malts
its
fruity
and
warming
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
average
also
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
too
much
carbonation
this
is
one
for
the
drawing
board
these
guys
need
some
new
yeast
the
character
this
one
gives
off
is
terrible
it
ruins
every
beer
i
wont
be
coming
back
to
this
one
i
had
a
sip
of
my
wifes
whitsun
at
the
michigan
beer
festival
and
i
dont
remember
it
like
this
the
flavors
associated
dont
indicate
any
sort
of
infection
or
oxidation
so
i
have
to
assume
this
bottle
is
okay
honestly
this
is
the
worst
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
but
its
not
bad
enough
to
make
me
pour
it
down
the
drain
out
of
respect
for
beer
i
suppose
if
youre
into
strongly
fruity
fruit
beers
this
would
be
to
your
liking
drinks
more
like
an
uberwit
or
belgian
pa
enjoyed
this
but
off
style
imo
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
medium
head
that
has
ok
retention
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
yeast
character
along
with
some
fruit
but
not
as
much
banana
or
clove
as
expected
the
flavor
has
some
clove
and
other
fruitiness
and
finishes
with
a
spiciness
either
from
the
yeast
or
from
the
hops
the
body
is
medium
and
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
wheat
beer
but
i
prefer
the
real
ones
over
the
american
versions
the
feel
is
a
bit
fizzy
and
bubbly
almost
champagnelike
but
also
smooth
thankfully
its
not
really
a
wit
but
a
saison
bubbly
fizzy
sour
pungent
yet
surprisingly
smooth
this
is
fairly
similar
to
an
american
pale
ale
i
homebrewed
a
few
years
back
it
had
a
high
amount
of
bittering
hops
followed
by
some
dry
hopping
that
might
correlate
to
its
overall
ibu
level
orange
honey
color
head
disappeared
fast
but
that
could
be
my
fault
for
all
i
know
because
the
aroma
was
fresh
and
bready
with
a
very
slight
toffee
aspect
the
flavor
is
bready
tart
crisp
with
a
little
acidity
and
finishes
the
same
with
a
tiny
bit
of
citric
hops
tiny
not
even
sure
about
it
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
great
for
warm
weather

6er
imagine
my
surprise
when
a
place
around
the
corner
had
this
beer
on
nitrogen
tap
well
it
had
a
real
nice
pour
of
cascading
churned
golden
beauty
with
a
slight
haze
as
it
finally
stopped
churning
the
head
was
large
and
full
thanks
to
the
npour
the
smell
was
some
what
more
muted
but
i
think
this
may
have
been
due
partly
to
the
beer
gas
as
it
had
that
smell
but
there
was
still
a
residual
sweetness
of
malt
the
flavor
was
soft
and
wheaty
with
notes
of
citrus
and
subtle
bits
that
could
have
been
from
the
honey
or
the
yeast
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
but
also
light
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
anytime
of
the
year

this
was
at
the

not

at
more
of
a

a
ami

even
s
witbier
the
atste
is

this
is

its

wont
buy

i

added

also
much
better

bottle
than
on

while
i
might
forget
about
this
once
its
finished
it
is
nice
enough
while
im
drinking
it
its
like
the
perfect
intelligence
operative
it
doesnt
stand
out
and
it
mixes
right
into
the
crowd
that
said
the
mainstream
basic
nature
makes
it
drinkable
enough
ill
finish
it
with
a
smile
and
then
let
the
few
details
fade
the
smell
has
some
orange
and
honey
flavor
on
top
of
a
fair
amount
of
malt
the
taste
is
of
pale
malt
until
the
honey
and
fruit
flavors
pick
up
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
hazy
orange
beer
it
smells
like
oranges
it
tastes
like
very
acidic
wheat
beer
that
someone
has
added
orange
syrup
to
maybe
this
is
kinda
what
berliner
wiesse
is
like
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
with
acid
sting
i
am
not
into
this
beer
if
you
like
oranges
though
give
it
a
try
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
head
holds
itself
together
nicely
but
leaves
almost
no
lacing
kind
of
weird
actually
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
flowing
to
the
top
none
of
the
floaties
that
others
have
mentioned
really
a
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
sweet
citrus
apricots
specifically
taste
also
gives
a
blast
of
citrus
this
is
really
the
most
noticable
apricot
flavor
ive
ever
had
in
a
beer
finishes
with
a
definate
sour
note
to
it
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
overall
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
based
on
the
other
reviews
i
saw
maybe
buying
brewery
fresh
is
the
way
to
go
with
this
one
the
sourness
starts
to
get
old
about
half
way
through
the
glass
but
not
enough
to
ruin
an
overall
good
impression
a
very
one
dimensional
beer
and
not
world
class
by
any
means
but
one
i
would
certainly
try
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
is
has
a
somewhat
refreshing
taste
to
it
the
flavor
was
fruity
with
a
hint
of
apples
carmelized
malt
thick
not
what
i
expect
in
a
wheat
but
it
is
good
dits
too
sour
tart
and
tangy
for
me
i
think
i
will
avoid
it
in
the
future
you
can
taste
the
honey
added
to
this
slightly
cloying
lighter
bodied
but
almost
a
little
too
sticky
sweet
for
my
liking
in
a
summer
beer
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
am
glad
i
bought
just
one
too
sweet
and
sticky
for
me
but
it
does
have
some
flavor
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
about
most
beers
of
this
style
american
pale
wheat
ale
is
that
the
new
american
name
for
a
witbier
to
keep
us
from
comparing
this
beer
to
hooegarten
nevermind
there
are
enough
character
here
for
me
to
think
that
they
were
intending
to
create
a
witbier
but
fell
short
but
they
didnt
fall
too
short
its
tasty
beer
just
out
of
style
there
are
nice
orange
and
lemon
flavors
but
poorly
balanced
with
creamy
malts
and
body
building
proteins
low
wheat
additions
the
estery
qualities
are
low
other
than
the
citrus
the
yeasty
bready
flavors
and
feel
are
less
than
desired
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fizzy
and
numbing
because
of
the
light
body
and
increased
alcohol
the
alcohols
also
taste
phenolic
and
medicinal
but
not
to
offend
i
like
the
aggression
in
the
american
interpretation
of
this
beer
a
better
body
would
make
all
the
difference
anyway
the
nose
is
excellent
a
refreshing
sweet
and
tart
whiff
of
lemon
and
subtle
wheatgrain
taste
is
good
with
a
sweet
orange
wheatiness
that
gives
way
to
a
malty
finish
flavors
are
subdued
but
overall
pleasing
mouth
feel
is
light
but
good
for
a
summer
beer

cloying

note
on
the

significant
acidity
rises
up
first
followed
by
some
fruits
and
then
a
very
odd
for
a

nutty
malt
note
the
overall
impression
is
of
a
slightly
weird
german
wheat
beer
with
less
clove
and
bubblegum
esters
and
a
bit
more
malt
plus
that
yeasty
aroma
and
taste
although
im
not
sure
if
thats
intentional
here
this
is
a
rare
proof
that
american
wheat
does
not
have
to
mean
bland
and
insipid
very
fresh
malt
flavor
without
any
bready
or
cracker
notes
some
lightly
fruity
flavors
that
did
not
call
to
mind
any
particular
fruit
but
rather
a
general
fruityness
that
rode
along
the
malt
some
slightly
acidic
tartness
in

up
nicely
not
a
beer
that
makes
a
big
commotion

when
it
is
done
you
are
sorry
to
see
it
gone
would
i
have
this
one
again
possibly
but
it
wouldnt
be
high
up
on
the
list
you
could
do
much
worse
but
there
are
tons

this

there
is

flavor
nor
anything
else
to

the

please
1st
taste
this
beer
had
a
good
taste
some
wheat
flavor
in
the
first
sip
similar
to
a
blue
moon
but
this
one
was
a
little
more
bitter
maybe
some
more
hops
in
this
than
blue
moon
surprising
to
me
there
was
a
strong
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
only
6
1
so
that
seemed
a
little
strange
nonetheless
this
was
a
good
beer
and
i
would
like
to
drink
another
it
pours
a
nice
golden
bronze
color
a
nice
soft

shade
the
head
is
well
i
guess
there
isnt
one
this
one
is
screaming
for
more
carbonation
it
smells
malty
and
sweet
and
i
notice
a
hint
of
citrus
fruits
lingering
in
the
background
the
taste
doesnt
quite
seem
what
i
expected
i
dont
believe
this
is
true
to
the
style
its
way
too
sweet
but
the
tart
taste
at
the
end
of
the
sip
is
nice
it
leaves
a
syrupy
feel
in
my
mouth
after
the
drink
i
dont
really
notice
much
flavor
similar
to
a
wheat
ale
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
im
a
little
dissapointed
darked
than
your
average
apwa
still
has
a
cool
lighting
effect
that
almost
makes
the
beer
seem
to
glow

is
not
there
very
odd
for
a
wheat
beer
smell
is
lightly
sweet
with
bread
dough
light
citrus
and
some
floral
hops
taste
is
plenty
hoppy
but
this
is
missing
some
of
the
essential
flavors
that
a
apwa
must
have
not
much
of
a
banana
flavor
not
a
lot
of
cloves
tastes
more
like
an
amber
ale
mouthfeel
is
too
thick
and
muddied
for
the
style
needs
to
be
lighter
and
more
crisp
not
a
bad
beer
in
any
sense
of
the
word
just
didnt
find
the
style
quite
hazy
and
sedimented
medium
yellow
ochre
with
an
illuminated
back
tone
head
is
thin
in
the
texture
of
the
bubbles
rises
to
14
of
an
inch
with
pretty
good
staying
power
laces
are
average
in
presentation
mostly
noninterlocking
downward
dripping
strings
odd
aromas
slightly
citric
as
in
citrons
candied
fruit
with
medicinal
qualities
mouthfeel
has
decent
fine
carbonation
but
is
overly
thick
for
style
and
verging
on
gloppy
flavor
starts
fruity
but
too
sweetened
some
spice
but
is
also
lactic
and
almost
like
a
mayonaise
with
tang
and
eggy
notes
still
holds
on
to
phenolic
senses
to
the
aftertaste
strangely
composed
i
can
often
have
trouble
with
this
style
the
spices
sometimes
strike
me
as
odd
but
in
addition
this
is
too
thick
thanks
to
hopheadken
for
trading
his
indianna
and
michigan
brews
for
some
missouri
locals
my
sisterinlaw
upon
one
sip
proclaimed
that
drinking
it
was
like
licking
bark
anyhow
i
wont
bother
with
this
one
again
not
bad
actually
just
needs
some
zing
to
make
me
or
anyone
with
taste
stand
up
and
salute
as
it
is
it
aint
happenin
slàinte
drinkability
is
above
average
for
me
it
is
easy
going
down
and
refreshing
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
seasonals
i
look
for
it
each
spring
and
it
never
dissapoints
me
this
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
during
the
warm
michigan
months
i
keep
on
finding
some
bargains
at
my
local
store
and
this
was
one
of
them
it
pours
out
with
a
sizable
3
finger
head
containing
small
and
medium
sized
bubbles
body
is
orange
with
a
few
chunks
of
sediment
looks
more
like
protein
than
yeast
smell
reminded
me
a
lot
of
an
english
pale
ale
very
biscuity
with
a
hint
of
citrus
can
only
pick
up
a
slight
aroma
of
banana
taste
is
very
clean
and
quenching
notes
of
citrus
in
the
beginning
gently
fade
into
a
strong
bread
like
malt
before
disolving
into
banana
nice
beer
this
could
quite
possibly
be
my
favorite
arcadia
brew
to
date
arcadia
whitsun
isnt
a
head
turner
but
it
is
a
solid
semiwheat
ale
that
i
could
drink
by
the
gallon
on
a
lazy
summer
day
very
drinkable
its
just
too
bad
this
isnt
the
flagship
beer
of
michigan
rather
sharp
fizz
in
light
body
i
really
wanted
another
but
i
had
another
hours
drive
ahead
of
me
ill
come
someday
with
a
dd
appearance
deep
cloudy
hazed
amber
golden
creamy
head
forms
nicely
leaves
heavy
chunks
of
lacing
aroma
slight
subtle
spice
sharp
wheat
sweetness
touch
of
citrus
not
bad
seems
a
bit
muted
overall
though
taste
slight
english
tone
to
it
with
a
mix
of
caramel
malt
and
unmalted
wheat
grains
touch
of
spice
and
citrus
appear
but
relatively
toned
down
not
a
bad
american
pale
wheat
at
all
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
evenly
carbonated
was
a
smooth
drinking
beer
after
the
jack
johnson
concert
drinkability
was
definitely
a
brew
i
could
have
sipped
on
for
awhile
but
i
spotted
better
offerings
namingly
snake
river
zonker
stout
nice
fruit
smell
with
malty
overtones
nice
taste
is
good
but
out
of
style
in
my
opinion
its
too
hoppy
and
fruity
its
heavy
too
it
is
very
drinkable
and
a
very
good
beer
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
refreshing
summer
wheat
this
isnt
it
it
is
closer
to
a
good
american
amber
in
my
opinion
again
a
good
brew
but
not
what
i
buy
a
wheat
for
for
my
money
much
better
than
bells
overrated
oberon
and
im
from
kalamazoo
ng
trbeer
gets
another
thanks
for
the
many
samples
this
is
the
absolute
worst
tasting
beer
ive
ever
had
i
couldnt
get
this
into
the
sink
fast
enough
thanks
to
trbeer
for
the
bottle
though
this
is
a
bit
overly
sweet
for
a
couple
this
is
a
fantastic
hefe
with
a
unique
sweet
taste
to
it
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
have
this
one
again
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
ales
along
with
bells
oberon
certainly
worth
the
price
of
a
sixpack
drinkability
is
very
high
classic
summer
beer
this
beer
when
poured
formed
a
small
sized
tan
head
with
finelarge
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipated
the
body
of
this
beer
was
very
dense
carbonated
and
yeast
was
observed
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
the
hue
reminded
me
of
the
hue
of
iced
tea
the
nose
was
light
malts
and
hops
and
the
flavor
was
tangy
tart
and
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
tingly
thin
watery
and
light
bodied
this
beer
had
no
lacing
and
this
whitsun
is
one
of
arcadias
more
interesting
offerings
traditional
in
appearance
and
perhaps
in
aroma
the
flavors
are
anything
but
orangegolden
hue
thoroughly
hazed
faint
orange
and
cloves
aroma
great
wheat
citrus
flavor
that
focuses
more
on
the
orange
than
the
lemon
phenolic
cloves
and
banana
are
light
but
present
a
light
dose
of
hop
bitterness
rounds
out
the
picture
its
by
no
means
an
americanstyle
hefe
but
its
also
not
bavarian
its
an
interesting
change
of
pace
fans
of
bells
oberon
should
consider
trying
this
i
think
its
far
more
balanced
unique
and
interesting
something
about
all
that
yeast
floating
around
makes
me
not
want
to
drink
this
beer
and
thus
causes
for
a
lower
than
average
appearance
rating
but
the
actual
flavor
of
this
beer
is
quite
nice
the
yeast
is
definitely
noticeable
creating
a
dry
bready
flavor
underneath
that
there
are
lots
of
citrus
fruits
here
and
spices
but
oddly
enough
i
dont
really
taste
the
banana
and
clove
like
most
wheats
have
coriander
and
peach
seem
to
be
apparent
with
other
obscure
flavors
following
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
in
the
summer
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
like
it
near
as
much
any
other
time
of
the
year
pours
out
to
a
cloudy
golden
with
peach
accents
forming
a
lightbeige
seafoam
head
atop
mediumsized
bubbles
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
carbonation
is
moderately
strong
aroma
is
of
lemony
hops
mildly
toasted
pale
malts
no
detectable
orange
coriander
banana
or
clove
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
rather
soft
and
watery
with
a
wet
finish
despite
its
strength
taste
begins
with
rather
earthy
hops
with
a
lemon
pith
character
and
moderately
strong
intensity
toasty
grains
have
a
pronounced
tannic
bitterness
in
the
middle
followed
by
more
earthy
bitterness
and
a
hint
of
peach
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
corn
is
noticeable
in
aroma
and
taste
towards
the
end
bready
and
yeasty
to
an
extent
but
not
pleasurable
alcohol
becomes
astringent
as
it
warms
not
very
balanced
and
not
very
drinkable
either
ill
stick
to
oberon
thank
you
pours
a
murky
amber
with
some
chunks
floating
around
no
matter
how
carefully
you
pour
it
the
aroma
started
with
a
big
whiff
of
bannanas
and
faded
to
a
bready
slightly
fruity
and
very
faint
smell
taste
is
somewhat
fruity
with
a
malty
backbone
and
a
touch
of
extra
hop
bitterness
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
definitly
encourages
to
try
more
wheats
im
never
overly
impressed
with
the
appearance
of
this
beerit
pours
a
murky
orangeamber
color
and
often
has
some
unattractive
yeast
strains
milling
about
but
i
look
forward
to
tasting
and
drinking
this
beer
each
and
every
year
i
think
this
is
a
summer
must
try
for
all
lovers
of
the
style
you
wont
find
much
banana
or
clove
here
more
a
solid
grainyfruity
flavor
that
borders
on
a
touch
syrupy
yet
it
does
refresh
and
i
find
the
drinkability
here
is
quite
nice
i
always
want
a
second
as
the
overall
taste
is
just
plain
good
when
youre
at
your
whitsend
reach
for
a
whitsun
probably
superior
with
a
whole
wheat
pizza
thanks
to
trbeer
its
very
cloudy
burnt
orange
with
a
large
fluffy
head
that
reduces
to
a
nice
coating
throughout
consumption
the
aroma
is
great
buttery
and
hoppy
and
wheaty
its
such
an
interesting
white
because
it
has
this
certain
caramel
maltiness
amongst
the
wheat
character
this
is
definitley
a
unique
wheat
beer
and
is
exceptionally
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
just
love
the
malt
character
in
there
pours
a
hazy
medium
amber
color
topped
by
a
thick
off
white
head
the
head
never
really
completely
fades
away
hanging
around
for
the
entire
trip
spicy
clove
laden
aroma
has
a
strong
wheat
component
the
taste
is
great
a
nice
balance
between
a
wheat
beer
and
a
stronger
beer
almost
like
an
ipa
nice
dose
of
hops
but
still
has
that
creamy
bready
yeast
note
and
good
fruitiness
a
good
touch
of
banana
in
the
flavor
but
not
much
in
the
nose
exceptionally
smooth
mouthfeel
lends
to
the
very
good
drinkability
im
glad
i
finally
found
this
beer
a
great
beer
lovers
wheat
im
not
usually
into
wheat
beers
but
this
is
an
exception
very
nicely
crafted
warm
weather
brew
here
the
look
is
good
with
a
nice
cloudy
yellow
amber
body
topped
by
a
nice
white
head
that
laces
like
new
fallen
snow
coating
everything
in
sight
clean
crisp
smell
with
hints
of
citrus
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
oh
so
good
creamy
body
brings
to
the
palate
a
subtle
and
understated
graininess
that
is
puntuated
by
the
crisp
fruit
notes
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
persistent
white
head
that
leaves
behind
rings
of
lace
aroma
and
flavor
are
musty
with
bubblegum
and
some
grainy
notes
flavor
is
a
little
on
the
subdued
side
but
still
quite
pleasant
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
medium
carbonation
a
very
easy
drinking
summer
wheat
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
amber
gold
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
left
some
nice
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
a
slight
aroma
of
hops
and
grainbread
a
flavor
of
hops
malt
lightly
of
caramel
and
some
cirtus
the
finish
was
light
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
it
i
agree
that
this
is
not
really
a
belgian
wit
or
a
german
wheat
it
is
something
sort
of
in
the
middle
a
good
beer
but
kind
of
hard
to
place
what
style
it
is
trying
to
be
striking
golden
amber
color
hazy
with
a
bit
of
sediment
minimal
head
of
fine
white
foam
that
dissipates
quickly
with
almost
no
lacing
clean
light
grain
smell
is
pleasant
but
weak
soft
fruity
notes
present
as
well
very
smooth
mouthfeel
balances
the
crisp
hops
quite
nicely
soft
fruity
sweetness
throughout
the
drink
hints
at
banana
seemed
to
get
better
as
the
glass
got
emptier
an
interesting
soft
wheat
this
wheat
beer
has
a
hoppy
bread
and
buttery
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
round
banana
finish
different
and
good
this
brew
belongs
in
an
american
wheat
beer
style
if
anything
the
flavors
do
not
really
resemble
a
pure
belgian
wit
or
a
greman
wheat
not
bad
though
here
in
michigan
we
are
blessed
with
two
fine
summer
beers
bells
oberon
and
arcadias
whitsun
this
beer
is
flat
out
good
there
is
a
light
citrus
taste
with
malt
sweetness
to
it
it
is
unlike
any
wheat
ive
had
before
there
are
hops
but
they
are
there
for
balance
not
for
show
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
and
due
to
that
i
am
giving
it
a
5
in
the
mouthfeel
category
as
it
just
feels
and
tastes
right
while
oberon
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
and
a
great
summer
beer
this
was
mediocre
at
best
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
one
pleasing
by
looks
and
smell
from
the
first
pour
cloudy
with
some
residue
this
lilikoi
infused
wheat
is
average
at
best
leaves
a
note
of
citrus
and
yeast
undertones
but
doesnt
distract
from
overall
taste
not
half
bad
but
nothing
amazing
it
gets
better
halfway
into
it
it
has
a
nice
hint
of
passion
fruit
in
the
aftertaste
its
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
on
the
beach
on
a
hot
day
enjoyed
it
overlooking
the
ocean
while
on
our
honeymoon
so
that
might
make
it
better
than
expected
this
is
the
perfect
floating
beer
for
when
you
just
need
something
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
while
floating
in
your
pool
in
the
hot
california
summer
the
passion
fruit
flavors
arent
cloying
o
very
drinkable
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
o
as
i
mentioned
id
rather
there
was
more
tropical
fruit
flavor
but
im
glad
its
there
recommended
and
definitely
worth
a
try
o
good
but
not
great
it
came
in
a
mix
pack
and
i
actually
liked
every
beer
in
the
mix
pack
if
you
have
a
chance
pick
one
up
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
specifically
again
but
i
would
definitely
buy
the
mix
pack
again
pours
a
very
pale
straw
in
color
quickly
dissapating
head
that
left
a
soapy
thin
ring
around
the
glass
lightly
floral
in
the
nose
delicate
fruit
and
grain
scents
flavor
itself
is
very
delicate
and
mild
almost
light
lager
in
mouthfeel
with
how
thin
it
is
floral
and
almost
lightly
purfumey
flavors
watered
down
fruit
punch
at
the
end
with
a
high
carbonic
bite
hides
its
5
4
abv
very
well
as
it
tastes
like
a
light
beer
in
nose
flavor
and
mouthfeel
unexpected
bonus
for
light
beer
drinkers
but
a
disappointment
for
someone
who
was
looking
for
more
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
not
look
to
this
as
an
example
of
a
wheat
beer
there
are
so
many
better
wheat
beers
out
there
it
tastes
and
smells
more
like
a
plain
american
adjunct
lager
pours
a
clear
gold
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
wheat
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
hops
and
an
earthiness
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
a
low
carbonation
level
tastes
of
wheat
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
hop
and
a
plantearthiness
overall
good
appearance
and
feel
with
a
decent
body
and
blend
o
just
a
soso
brew
for
me
nothing
i
would
grab
again
with
all
that
being
said
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
be
excited
to
order
it
if
it
was
ontap
at
a
restaurant
or
bar
i
would
however
tell
a
friend
it
is
a
decent
and
refreshing
beer
nothing
too
harsh
or
bitter
about
it
as
american
pale
wheats
go
its
okay
just
lacking
in
character
dry
refreshing
a
little
more
fruit
would
be
appreciated
yeast
contributes
little
a
good
introductory
wheat
beer
but
nothing
a
beer
geek
would
get
excited
about
im
not
going
to
waste
my
time
with
a
long
review
poured
from
a
bottle
from
a
6pack
into
a
tulip
glass
i
had
higher
expectations
for
this
beer
it
poured
a
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
head
that
held
for
a
few
minutes
it
had
faint
smells
of
passion
fruit
and
citrus
so
i
was
really
excited
it
tasted
like
someone
squirted
an
unripe
passion
fruit
into
a
can
of
pbr
such
a
let
down
the
passion
fruit
taste
faded
quickly
very
carbonated
so
it
probably
masked
some
unappealing
tastes
even
when
it
warmed
up
in
the
glass
i
would
not
buy
again
and
luckily
my
wife
has
some
coworkers
over
that
will
probably
finish
off
the
rest
of
my
6pack
o
pretty
plain
jane
brew
thought
this
was
a
lager
as
i
sipped
drinkable
but
unremarkable
overall
drinkability
i
actually
kind
of
liked
this
very
summer
beer
definitely
competes
with
a
leinie
shandy
the
verdict
different
the
passion
fruit
gives
it
a
tropical
sweetness
im
not
used
to
in
a
beer
my
tongue
isnt
quite
sure
what
to
think
of
it
yet
good
balance
the
fruit
isnt
overpowering
at
all
there
is
plenty
of
malt
flavor
and
hop
bitterness
to
remind
you
that
youre
still
drinking
a
beer
the
taste
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
but
overall
it
was
closer
to
average
i
wont
try
it
again
after
this
variety
pack
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
summer
i
think
ill
be
buying
more
actually
a
nice
tame
beer
but
when
you
take
the
time
to
peak
at
it
its
pretty
fun
the
more
i
get
through
it
the
more
the
passion
fruit
flavor
comes
through
check
this
beer
out
for
sure
o
alright
not
really
overly
thrilled
with
the
mixture
of
fruit
in
a
beer
so
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
the
passion
fruit
was
not
dominant
over
the
wheat
so
it
was
not
a
bad
choice
probably
will
not
buy
it
again
but
i
enjoyed
the
taste
of
a
newly
found
beer
overall
as
far
as
fruit
beers
go
this
one
gets
it
about
right
the
fruit
is
present
but
without
tasting
like
a
flavored
malt
beverage
it
mainly
adds
some
depth
to
the
taste
of
a
pale
wheat
beer
a
good
summer
brew
overall
a
pretty
decent
summer
wheat
ale
nice
tropical
fruit
esters
not
much
to
it
other
than
the
wheat
and
fruit
but
it
tastes
good
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
didnt
wow
me
either
the
embossed
bottle
advertises
this
stuff
as
liquid
aloha
not
unlike
a
tropical
koolaid
mix
suffice
it
to
say

would
give
this
a

it

over

for

i
think
it
is
the
most
enjoyable
with
that
amount
of
fruitiness
the
smell
is
fruity
it
is
probably
better
to
drink
cold
from
a
bottle
so
the
fruit
stays
down
the
top
of
the
beer
has
a
bit
too
hot
intense
of
a
fruityness
after
that
it
mellows
out
nicely
and
is
pretty
drinkable
i
had
it
on
tap
and
it
was
much
better
as
the
fruit
aromas
had
dissipated
a
bit
in
the
bottle
hints
of
passion
fruit
any
more
than
that
is
overkill

heavy

clove

pepper

overwhelmed
the

was

at

stinging

this
a
number
of
times
and
each
batch
is
a
little
different
pour
is
a
hazy
gold
though
it
gets
much
more
hazy
as
you
get
towards
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
beer
has
the
characteristics
of
a
brett
fermented
beer
and
it
has
developed
nicely
at
approximately
9
mo
to
1
yr
of
age
it
has
a
bright
yeasty
fruitiness
apple
and
white
grape
with
a
touch
of
citrus
with
some
white
pepper
and
a
touch
of
tartness
there
is
a
barnyard
funkiness
that
keeps
things
interesting
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
alcohol
presence
that
moderates
some
of
the
refreshing
aspects
pleasantly
effervescent
overall
an
enjoyable
and
nicely
executed
beer
with
brett
yeast
that
develops
with
a
little
bit
of
age
though
it
lacks
a
bit
of
depth
its
very
enjoyable
and
id
certainly
pick
one
up
again
not
a
really
good
wheat
beer
would
pass
on
this
in
the
future
without
a
doubt
had
this
beer
as
part
of
a
night
of
beer
tasting
750ml
bottle
e047
batch
claims
to
be
a
belgian
american
ale
using
french
and
american
malts
us
hops
but
with
the
kicker
being
belgian
english
and
wild
yeast
this
is
ever
so
appearant
when
poured
into
a
glass
inches
of
foam
appear
unlike
any
american
beer
i
have
had
it
paralells
duvel
or
a
belgian
quad
with
the
amount
of
foam
that
lingers
after
the
pour
way
more
foam
than
actual
liquid
which
is
something
i
happen
to
admire
in
a
beer
the
liquid
hangs
there
as
hazy
unfiltered
golden
color
herbal
and
fruit
but
definite
unfiltered
wheat
characteristics
750
ml
bottle
batch
e043
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
at
least
a
couple
inch
frothy
offwhite
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
very
long
time
theres
also
a
lot
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
breadywheat
malt
lemon
peel
floral
hops
apples
and
some
grassiness
it
tastes
like
breadywheat
malt
lemon
peel
apricots
grasshay
and
some
light
clove
and
peppery
spice
i
like
the
tartness
in
this
brew
i
didnt
really
expect
that
so
it
was
a
nice
surprise
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
creamy
and
is
well
carbonated
i
think
this
is
good
id
certainly
like
to
try
white
gold
again
in
the
future

a
bottle
high
b
a
medium
body
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
am
honestly
shocked
at
the
rating
on
it
its
not
even
a
4
really
this
is
almost
a
5
in
my
book
and
this
is
coming
from
a
dude
whos
had
a
lot
of
beers
one
of
ithacas
better
new
offerings
loved
it
third
glass
all
the
wheat
sediment
is
here
obviously
very
very
cloudy
and
much
more
spicy
all
black
pepper
and
lemon
now
very
much
belgian
wheat
now
probably
the
least
interesting
glass
of
the
bottle
which
is
for
the
best
since
i
would
have
cried
when
i
finished
it
otherwise
o
a
very
tasty
beer
easy
to
drink
but
with
delicious
complex
flavors
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
o
what
a
great
beer
wellexecuted
pale
wheat
ale
like
a
crisp
hefeweizen
with
a
kick
o
good
brew
for
summer
this
beer
pours
perfectly
straw
color
lemon
yellow
sun
kissed
gold
with
a
white
head
of
foam
that
fell
fast
to
a
thick
cap
great
lace
it
had
a
bouquet
that
filled
the
nose
traditional
belgian
nose
yeasty
barnyard
horse
blanket
musty
pepper
and
ripe
fruit
apples
and
white
grapes
with
a
touch
of
lemon
caramel
malt
what
was
missing
if
you
want
to
think
that
it
was
missing
was
bubblegum
and
banana
no
alcohol
on
the
palate
either
this
drank
well
it
was
dry
crisp
and
the
ripe
fruit
washed
over
the
palate
juicy
and
a
little
tart
it
drank
like
dry
white
wine
earthy
and
bright
the
malt
stood
up
in
the
glass
and
was
not
weak
the
beer
had
a
fine
balance
prickly
carbonation
so
it
wasnt
soft
but
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
its
traditional
belgian
refreshing
and
lively
overall
this
does
taste
like
a
belgian
beer
and
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
mixed
together
this
is
a
little
too
sour
to
be
what
i
want
on
a
hot
day
but
real
good
regardless
white
gold
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
excelsior
series
its
a
tasty
beer
that
definitely
has
more
depth
and
character
than
you
might
expect
i
wouldnt
fewer
bubbles
but
thats
my
only
small
complaint
good
stuff
definitely
recommended
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
and
flavorful
wheat
ales
ive
ever
had
the
use
of
three
different
yeasts
really
imparts
some
tremendous
spice
there
is
a
noticeable
hop
character
that
is
very
complementary
i
really
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
if
i
could
get
ithaca
in
nc
i
would
definitely
get
another
bottle
of
this
a
bright
beer
with
a
certain
funk
that
is
intriguing
zippy
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
which
is
a
nice
surprise
o
an
enjoyable
cross
between
a
belgian
style
and
wheat
ale
glad
i
have
another
one
down
stairs
overall
a
pretty
nice
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
however
i
was
hoping
for
better
when
i
read
the
description
on
the
bottle
postscript

back
at
sapsuckers
once
again
im
happy
to
note
that
the
iwg
is
still
on
tap
and
as
tasty
as
10
days
ago
on
tap
pours
a
translucent
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
good
amount
of
lacing
aromas
of
bread
orange
peel
lemon
and
bitterness
hard
to
pick
up
on
too
much
since
the
smell
is
pretty
faint
taste
is
of
orange
peel
lemon
apple
bread
and
some
hop
bitterness
bitter
orange
and
lemon
peel
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
good
alcohol
presence
this
is
a
style
im
luke
warm
on
but
this
is
a
solid
wheat
overall
worth
having
again
for
certain
if
it
wasnt
for
the
noticeable
alcohol
this
would
be
alot
like
a
belgian
triple
with
wheat
an
enjoyable
beer
only
slightly
overpriced

extremely
smooth
to
sip
on
this
has
held
up
well
for
the

really
enjoyable

o
a
nice
blend
of
numerous

its
always
nice
when
ithaca

would
love

is
very

this
is

drink
many
things
going

really
enjoyed

i
would
love
another
bottle
88100
overall
a
quality
beer
that
is
well
worth
its
price
ithaca
makes
some
fantastic
beers
and
im
happy
i
gave
this
one
a
try
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
750ml
was
the
perfect
amount
for
me
unsuspecting
fans
of
the
old
white
gold
are
in
for
a
surprise
and
maybe
a
bit
of
disappointment
still
a
tasty
beer
but
very
very
different
when
i
bought
this
i
wasnt
paying
attention
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
sour
ale
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
large
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
lots
of
wild
yeast
sour
notes
on
the
nose
i
wasnt
able
to
even
get
much
besides
that
from
the
beer
the
taste
of
it
was
also
quite
sour
and
really
killed
off
any
of
the
soft
wheat
flavors
that
might
have
been
in
there
before
the
wild
yeast
was
tossed
in
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
like
champagne
very
bubbly
and
fizzed
up
inside
the
mouth
overall
this
beer
wasnt
all
that
impressive
to
me
had
i
read
the
label
more
or
something
i
may
not
have
even
bought
it
thin
bodied
with
lower
carbonation
and
a
semi
dry
finish
i
would
offer
this
beer
to
many
wine
enthusiasts
i
know
and
expect
that
there
would
be
a
significant
appreciation
for
the
beer
a
wonderful
insghtful
and
innovative
beer
for
the
us
this
beer
is
surprisingly
great
im
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
say
this
is
amazing
hazy
golden
with
a
white
head
that
fades
to
a
collar
yes
i
smell
wheat
and
i
spy
esters
and
phenols
but
what
blows
me
away
is
how
much
this
reminds
me
of
pineapple
upsidedown
cake
to
me
nose
is
straight
pineapple
upsidedown
cake
sprinkled
with
powdered
sugar
and
topped
with
preserved
lemons
if
pineapple
upsidedown
cake
could
drink
dry
with
a
hint
of
wet
rock
minerality
a
touch
of
lemony
goodness
and
a
hint
of
earthy
funk
then
this
is
what
it
would
taste
like
medium
body
that
translates
light
and
fluffy
with
near
perfect
carbonation
that
leaves
a
pleasant
prickly
sensation
and
dry
dry
finish
awesome
m
plenty
of
belgian
ipa
a
mixture
of
yeast
sweetness
and
big
hops
the
funk
that
exists
does
so
only
near
the
end
of
each
sip
a
pleasant
departure
the
hoppiness
feels
heavy
making
sharing
a
must
o
wow
i
know
ithaca
makes
good
beer
but
my
goodness
this
was
a
treat
would
love
to
get
my
hand
on
a
bottle
of
this
o
i
cant
wait
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
after
a
couple
years
in
my
cellar
this
is
not
a
style
that
i
would
usually
rate
this
high
but
this
is
fabulous
so
damn
much
going
on
here
i
will
most
certainly
be
grabbing
a
few
more
of
these
and
spacing
out
the
tasting
times
overall
a
nice
beer
i
think
of
fantome
when
i
drink
this
but
its
not
near
the
qualitycomplexity
that
it
has
a
nice
mellow
night
beer
good
with
opeths
heritage
album
overall
this
is
a
really
well
crafted
beer
and
as
i
mentioned
like
absolutely
nothing
else
in
this
category
that
ive
tried
id
almost
consider
this
an
american
wild
ale
and
try
to
match
it
up
against
some
of
those
great
ones
o
really
enjoy
this
brew
smooth
complex
nicely
drinkable
and
yet
feels
very
classy
loved
it
as
much
as
i
like
the
bananacloviness
of
a
good
wheat
beer
i
enjoyed
this
stab
at
the
style
because
it
was
not
a
bananaclovey
wheat
beer
the
amount
of
horsestall
funk
in
the
bottle
may
turn
away
some
wheat
fans
but
its
not
overpowering
after
all
who
doesnt
like
a
little
manure
in
his
beer
nice
color
light
aroma
and
light
body
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
sharp
bite
with
a
bubbly
edge
despite
the
high
for
a
wheat
beer
abv
this
doesnt
generate
much
heat
or
wobble
it
went
well
with
a
giant
bowl
of
popcorn
and
a
reviewing
of
dog
day
afternoon
light
medium
body
high
carbonation
dry
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
drinks
nice
and
easy
despite
the
higher
abv
which
is
masked
incredibly
well
too
bad
the
bottle
gushed
all
over
the
place
great
beer
from
ibc
worth
the
money
oyet
another
great
beer
from
ibc
wasnt
expecting
the
mild
tartness
but
it
was
a
pleasent
suprise
and
twist
on
the
american
pale
wheat
ale
in
short
each
sip
makes
me
want
another
even
more
well
done
ithaca
well
done
overall
this
is
a
beer
designed
to
appease
lovers
of
white
sparkling
wines
the
fruits
acids
tanins
and
pepper
character
play
in
a
more
winelike
proportion
than
of
beer
but
this
is
a
beer
and
a
wonderfully
crafted
one
at
that
only
the
medicial
phenolic
character
offer
a
distracting
flavor
and
aroma
that
i
cant
ignore
pretty
decent
all
up
smooth
and
drinkable
but
with
plenty
of
character
not
on
par
with
the
awesomeness
of
flower
power
but
another
very
solid
brew
from
ithaca
the
beer
appears
hazy
and
yellow
with
a
substantial
white
head
the
aroma
brings
citrus
hay
yeast
nice
flavor
and
well
balanced
a
hint
of
brett
funk
but
only
a
subtle
glimpse
of
wild
yeast
plenty
of
citrus
flavor
wheat
malt
makes
for
a
smooth
feel
hops
are
present
throughout
with
lasting
presence
in
the
finish
an
enjoyable
beer
i
would
have
this
again
o
if
you
can
get
past
the
odd
souring
white
wine
flavor
it
is
not
too
bad
i
would
suggest
using
a
different
blend
of
wild
yeast
as
the
current
ones
arent
cutting
it
the
cpj
pours
a
cloudy
golden
body
with
3
fingers
of
egg
white
head
falls
to
a
cap
that
lingers
throughout
consumption
nose
is
mostly
grass
and
other
earth
tones
as
well
as
tart
citrus
lemon
lots
of
tart
lemon
grass
wheat
malt
belgian
yeast
even
a
little
funk
to
this
offering
big
and
bold
for
a
pale
wheat
ale
and
also
fairly
dry
lighter
bodied
and
a
nice
dose
of
carbonation
gives
a
solid
mouthfeel
an
overall
refreshing
offering
from
ithaca
this
beer
pours
a
full
bodied
dull
golden
in
color
with
a
two
finger
bright
white
head
this
has
got
to
be
the
thickest
wheat
beer
ive
ever
seen
imagine
a
gold
imperial
stout
in
appearance
the
aromas
are
earthy
grassy
lemon
and
feature
a
tart
yeasty
aspect
which
is
quite
interesting
the
flavors
took
me
by
surprise
its
moderately
tart
and
you
can
pick
up
the
different
yeasts
its
very
grassy
and
again
features
a
lemon
like
tartness
it
drinks
kind
of
dry
and
is
full
in
body
the
viscosity
makes
this
wheat
a
little
harder
to
get
through
than
most
drinking
a
glass
makes
you
feel
like
you
just
consumed
a
loaf
of
bread
its
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
it
had
so
much
complexity
for
the
style
id
recommend
trying
this
one
but
probably
sharing
it
with
a
friend
o
interesting
beer
good
play
on
american
and
belgian
aspects
unfortunately
the
finish
is
disappointing
o
a
good
and
interesting
take
on
an
a
wheat
ale
pretty
easy
to
drink
the
citrus
does
become
a
tad
overbearing
and
takes
on
a
strong
rind
character
would
have
liked
the
wild
aspect
of
this
beer
to
come
out
more
d
super
drinkable
at
8
abv
there
is
very
little
evidence
of
it
the
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
and
fairly
rich
and
complex
without
feeling
heavy
overall
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
like
to
have
this
around
for
the
summer
months
beer
is
a
very
attractive
hazy
gold
with
an
ivory
head
smell
is
of
tangy
sourdough
bread
taste
opens
with
an
orangeycitrus
punch
and
finishes
with

cherrylemon
and

mouthfeel
is
good
its
pleasantly
carbonated
overall
a
very
nice
beer
its
big
and
assertive
and
not
very
subtle
but
its
not
trying
to
be
a
good
summer
time
beer
beer
is
lively
with
a
fast
rising
head
that
just
about
overflows
the
glass
pale
straw
appearance
with
a
good
waft
of
citruslemon
mild
sourness
comes
through
with
the
first
sip
not
overpoweringly
tart
but
extremely
pleasant
with
the
contrast
of
a
wheat
beer
with
the
belgian
influence
moutfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
the
melding
of
the
flavors
work
well
together
extremely
refreshing
and
effervescent
people
often
ask
about
good
intros
to
sours
and
even
though
this
is
not
identified
as
such
would
certainly
be
a
good
one
to
cut
your
teeth
on
i
find
it
similar
to
some
of
the
jolly
pumpkins
i
have
tried
an
all
around
great
summer
beer
and
one
i
will
revisit
very
soon
i
really
liked
what
white
gold
had
going
on
its
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
still
full
of
flavor
and
well
constructed
nice
warm
weather
beer
750
ml
to
frosty
pint
glass
the
beer
looks
good
for
its
type
pale
orange
and
lively
smells
good
too
with
notes
of
citrus
and
sour
tastes
good
itll
make
your
face
pucker
up
but
in
a
good
way
tastes
like
theres
some
apricot
somewhere
in
the
mix
too
mouthfeel
is
active
and
carbonated
overall
a
good
beer
that
id
probably
drink
more
regularly
if
it
wasnt
15bottle
notes
ithaca
is
bringing
there
a
game
with
this
wonderfully
complex
and
very
satisfying
belgian
influenced
ale
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
that
likes
american
belgian
or
german
wheat
ales
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
white
fluffy
head
fresh
light
refreshing
aroma
with
notes
of
grass
lemon
and
a
bit
of
spice
medium
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
lemony
slightly
sweet
mild
bitterness
summertime
beer
semidry
feeling
the
belgium
notes
come
in
but
its
pretty
mild
nice
the
feel
which
is
astringent
at
times
leads
to
the
tangy
acidic
citrus
combination
of
bretty
funk
and
american
hop
accents
the
fruity
yeast
is
countered
by
an
almost
limelike
character
from
the
bitter
hops
with
mild
pineapplegrapefruit
flavors
and
mellow
lemon
tinge
w
yeast
complexity
present
but
the
hops
have
mild
grassy
flavors
that
are
somewhat
fighting
for
the
spotlight
and
there
is
a
rind
like
flavor
w
funky
dry
yeastiness
in
the
finish
the
malt
which
is
obivously
doing
its
part
for
the
beer
is
not
over
the
top
bitter
but
it
doesnt
really
contribute
much
to
the
flavor
either
overall
i
find
this
beer
to
be
interesting
and
has
nice
brett
and
hop
flavors
but
the
combination
of
yeasts
and
hops
are
leaving
an
unbalanced
experience
and
the
only
real
detracting
thing
is
the
alcohol
becomes
noticeable
as
you
continue
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
one
hell
of
a
good
american
pale
wheat
the
use
of
the
belgium
yeasts
with
the
carbonation
and
the
citrus
and
sour
flavors
make
this
the
perfect
summer
drink
good
job
ithaca
o
i
was
able
to
try
this
at
als
but
im
confused
on
the
style
the
only
american
part
i
found
in
this
beer
was
the
bright
citrus
tones
and
piney
hops
theres
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
and
spices
along
with
the
funk
but
i
found
this
to
be
rather
enjoyable
when
first
served
the
belgian
notes
came
out
as
the
beer
warmed
o
wow
i
wish
this
werent
so
high
in
alcohol
it
is
dangerously
drinkable
and
the
only
reason
i
wouldnt
buy
it
in
bulk
because
of
the
high
price
tag
and
quick
yet
unnoticeable
buzz
from
the
high
abv
o
interesting
beer
for
sure
i
enjoyed
it
as
it
seemed
to
be
a
cross
of
several
different
styles
i
think
if
the
flavors
were
a
little
more
integrated
it
would
be
that
much
better
of
a
beer
taste
has
a
nice
blend
of
refreshing
wheat
and
hop
flavors
mixed
with
a
tart
mild
sourness
that
works
perfectly
on
the
palate
would
make
for
an
awesome
summertime
quencher
farmhouseish
but
still
maintains
a
certain
bright
cleanliness
if
that
makes
any
sense
really
nice
brew
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
sometime
i
was
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
upon
reading
the
label
but
damn
this
was
one
delicious
bottle
a
really
nice
beer
ithaca
has
here
i
am
loving
the
excelsior
series
d
starts
of
strong
in
terms
of
appearance
and
smell
but
quickly
works
its
way
back
to
average
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
muttled
mess
with
some
nice
things
going
on
but
no
clarity
the
mouthfeel
is
also
a
bit
odd
as
well
overall
the
sum
doesnt
equal
the
parts
an
interesting
offering
but
not
one
i
would
either
recommend
or
seek
out
again
drinkability
if
i
could
describe
this
beer
in
one
sentence
i
would
say
white
gold
is
a
blend
of
a
belgian
saison
a
witbier
and
a
german
berliner
weiss
a
truly
unique
beer
that
has
a
lot
going
on
ithaca
describes
it
as
a
rustic
pale
wheat
ale
and
i
have
to
agree
o
a
great
beer
with
sour
characteristics
which
are
very
well
balanced
a
great
deal
at
10
a
750ml
this
was
my
second
bottle
and
i
will
definitely
get
some
more
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
the
aftertaste
kind
of
bugs
me
im
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
i
thought
it
was
quite
interesting
i
dont
know
how
well
this
beer
would
develop
over
time
as
the
hop
character
fades
i
think
it
would
drift
into
a
deeply
sour
realm
with
little
else
i
like
the
initial
balance
effort
and
think
this
beer
would
probably
be
its
best
extremely
fresh
my
guess
is
this
bottle
is
probably
a
few
months
old
not
exactly
a
terribly
old
beer
but
the
hops
and
malt
would
play
better
i
suspect
this
is
my
second
brew
by
ithaca
the
first
being
flower
power
ipa
this
is
a
great
brew
it
was
recommended
by
a
friend
that
heard
about
the
brew
it
didnt
dissapoint
its
a
nice
solid
brew
that
has
a
flavor
that
have
to
say
i
have
never
had
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
brew
should
be
a
standard
for
the
style
the
brew
isnt
too
overpowering
either
so
it
could
be
easily
consumed
by
anyone
that
enjoys
the
style
ithaca
rocked
the
house
with
this
brew
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
have
it
on
tap
but
very
excited
to
have
the
bottle
as
well
white
gold
texas
tea
sweetener
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
creamwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
orange
zest
tart
lemon
zest
coriander
and
black
pepper
the
taste
holds
notes
of
blood
orange
peel
black
pepper
coriander
lightly
tart
mandarin
oranges
wheat
and
grass
things
dont
quite
meld
together
as
well
as
one
would
hope
the
body
straddles
the
border
between
heavy
light
and
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryish
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
very
similar
to
bells
oarsman
on
some
mild
steroids
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
fluff
bleach
white
foam
the
aromatics
are
a
slight
funky
notes
that
are
combined
with
citrus
notes
the
flavors
are
significantly
more
mild
than
the
aromas
had
let
on
the
flavors
are
more
sweet
wheat
flavors
than
the
funk
i
can
almost
not
taste
the
tart
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
chewy
and
goes
down
epically
smooth
though
theres
not
much
to
the
content
of
this
beer
i
enjoy
it
its
tasty
but
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
it
d
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
and
i
had
to
drainpour
the
last
13
of
the
bottle
due
to
the
extreme
sediment
to
separate
the
first
23
of
the
bottle
and
second
13
of
the
bottle
would
be
best
but
unfortunately
they
were
all
in
the
same
bottle
so
close
to
being
excellent
but
missed
on
so
many
points
d
this
beer
is
damn
impressive
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
how
is
this
beer
only
rated
a
b
i
suppose
a
year
on
the
bottle
was
the
right
decision
incredible
refreshing
and
would
be
excellent
to
pair
with
many
types
of
food
drinkability
i
was
sad
to
see
this
one
go
will
need
more
best
for
this
style
i
have
ever
had
overall
im
going
to
guess
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
at
least
i
hope
so
id
try
another
just
to
see
if
this
one
was
an
anomoly
we
both
loved
the
taste
much
more
on
the
palate
than
on
the
noise
it
is
hard
to
put
this
beer
in
a
categoryamerican
wheatsaisonwild
ale
combo
no
way
you
would
guess
8
abv
will
absolutely
buy
more
slightly
slick
going
down
this
beer
finishes
very
dry
i
found
it
to
be
sessionable
certainly
worth
a
try
the
looks
are
pretty
its
a
light
gold
colored
beer
with
a
lively
white
head
unfortunately
there
is
no
lacing
the
aroma
might
be
the
best
part
its
sporting
very
nice
lemon
that
dies
down
to
a
smooth
woodiness
the
taste
is
mostly
a
rustic
musty
woodiness
with
fresh
lemon
splashed
in
mild
citric
tartness
and
acidity
is
all
of
the
sour
qualities
this
beer
has
this
is
a
crazy
dry
beer
a
glass
of
water
might
be
a
good
idea
d
this
is
very
food
friendly
and
inviting
of
another
glass
we
were
drinking
it
while
snow
fell
outside
and
both
of
us
thought
it
was
more
of
a
summer
beer
than
winter
overall
ive
come
to
expect
good
things
from
ithaca
and
once
again
they
did
not
disappoint
this
was
not
a
style
i
was
expecting
to
be
terribly
impressed
with
but
when
we
were
at
the
brewery
it
was
the
only
bottle
from
the
excelsior
series
they
had
so
i
thought
id
try
it
out
to
quote
the
label
again
though
the
excelsior
series
defies
existing
style
guidelines
if
you
find
this
beer
anywhere
buy
it
and
that
should
be
doable
given
that
the
brewery
claims
that
it
can
be
cellared
indefinitely
d
easy
drinking
and
complex
for
what
it
is
without
stepping
too
far
outside
the
constraints
of
a
simple
wheat
beer
im
a
fan
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orange
yellow
color
with
a
good
sized
white
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lace
some
lemon
skin
toasted
wheat
and
a
sharp
cheesiness
in
the
nose
crisp
right
off
the
bat
plums
white
grape
sweetness
some
lemonlime
a
balancing
bitterness
and
a
biscuity
note
late
on
the
finish
creamy
and
soft
in
texture
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
heat
whatsoever
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
about
average
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
it
was
a
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
i
liked
the
little
bit
of
sour
flavor
to
it
it
gave
the
wheat
a
little
something
extra
and
different
it
was
pretty
smooth
overall
and
also
pretty
flavorful
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
d
at
8
abv
this
is
extremely
drinkable
its
not
noticeable
at
all
i
really
enjoy
this
offering
from
ithaca
overall
the
flavors
are
kind
of
muddled
in
my
opinion
and
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
i
appreciate
the
creativity
in
the
approach
but
it
fell
short
beer
is
thin
in
body
and
highly
carbonated
its
mildly
sweet
up
front
but
nice
on
the
finish
not
dry
at
all
this
is
how
you
make
an
american
wheat
ale
everyone
pay
attention
drinkability
high
mild
fruit
flavors
in
the
midpalate
mild
sweetness
wet
finish
no
aftertaste
easy
drinking
every
day
beer
if
it
were
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
d
an
easy
5
need
i
say
more
of
the
ithaca
brews
ive
had
this
one
ranks
among
the
best
theyve
ever
brewed
notes
at
first
i
found
this
to
be
a
little
simple
but
then
flavor
after
flavor
came
up
to
the
front
every
changing
dont
find
a
lot
of
wild
yeast
influence
here
though
no
acidity
at
all
not
any
real
funk
to
speak
of
the
flavor
takes
the
tartness
up
a
notch
with
a
juicy
funky
blast
of
orange
peel
and
dry
brett
wheat
gets
kicked
aside
but
manages
to
add
a
tasty
balance
of
bread
crust
to
the
mix
white
gold
finishes
with
a
bone
dry
crispnessbody
is
thin
and
wellcarbonated
overall
a
unique
beer
to
say
the
least
but
probably
not
something
id
want
to
have
again
worth
a
try
overall
white
gold
confuses
me
its
like
a
nonspicy
triple
and
i
really
dont
get
much
or
any
of
the
wild
yeasts
the
bottle
claims
with
that
being
said
its
still
a
good
brew
appearance
is
great
solid
flavors
i
find
that
this
beer
becomes
more
enjoyable
to
drink
as
it
warms
opens
up
still
its
nice
to
see
how
it
progresses
from
being
chilled
seemingly
drawing
influence
from
a
variety
of
styles
namely
american
pale
wheat
saison
wild
ale
makes
for
a
unique
interesting
if
somewhat
unconventional
brew
another
win
for
ithica
in
the
excelsior
line
it
stood
up
will
to
its
brother
the
old
habit
but
wasnt
close
to
driving
in
the
winning
run
the
spicier
still
more
complex
belgian
tripels
would
do
it
for
me
a
bit
better
than
this
but
this
was
an
excellent
beer
i
would
even
dare
to
say
a
fantastic
session
beer
d
no
way
this
is
8
0abv
is
my
first
though
feeling
more
at
home
like
a
5
session
exceptionally
smooth
tart
summer
time
quencher
with
session
like
attributes
that
i
could
easily
drink
all
day
if
not
for
the
alcohol
a
fairly
high
abv
with
an
incredibly
smoothness
of
a
5
session
and
one
i
could
drink
more
of
and
more
often
this
was
a
tasty
mildly
interesting
beer
that
doesnt
really
fit
nicely
into
a
particular
style
the
trappist
yeast
lends
a
distinctly
belgian
sweetness
to
the
flavor
and
the
wild
yeasts
provide
a
layer
of
mustiness
though
not
outright
funk
on
top
of
that
there
is
a
strong
citric
sweetness
like
an
apa
appearance
is
a
cloudy
straw
golden
yellow
with
a
retentive
bubbly
white
head
with
minimal
lacing
body
is
thick
and
creamy
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
that
leaves
a
sloppy
wet
and
musty
finish
aroma
is
dominated
by
the
earthy
and
musty
notes
much
more
so
than
the
flavor
is
with
little
presence
of
the
yeast
or
fruitiness
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
kind
of
sloppy
and
not
very
well
balanced
now
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
this
is
really
a
great
pale
what
ale
i
would
be
happy
to
grab
a
12
pack
of
this
and
stock
my
fridge
sadly
it
isnt
available
in
small
bottles
and
even
more
sadly
it
isnt
available
within
900
miles
of
where
i
live
thick
juicy
mouthfeel
goes
really
well
with
natural
citrus
fruity
flavors
and
aroma
very
sessionable
and
interesting
beer
supremely
drinkable
comparable
to
a
fantome
saison
tart
but
delicately
balanced
f
somewhat
bitter
not
a
lot
with
touch
of
lingering
spicy
earthy
grassy
mild
hops
mostly
dry
on
the
finish
pretty
dry
in
fact
a
dry
saison
farmhouse
finish
that
has
a
slight
wheat
finish
as
well
and
some
lingering
stickiness
like
it
was
a
memory
left
in
the
wake
of
the
dryness
a
little
bit
of
the
lingering
fruit
as
well
but
not
a
lot
theres
also
a
touch
of
a
booze
lingering
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
white
gold
definitely
defies
todays
style
guidelines
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
its
basically
a
belgian
tripel
meets
an
american
wheatits
good
but
it
could
be
great
if
it
finished
a
bit
cleaner
and
offered
a
bit
more
depth
of
malt
low
80s
in
milwaukee
today
d
this
is
an
interesting
beer
fairly
tasty
and
quite
refreshing
it
is
not
phenomenal
however
as
some
of
the
excelsior
series
are
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
for
a
warm
june
day
this
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
that
is
worth
picking
up
american
pale
wheat
ale
would
work
a
little
better
if
it
was
american
pale
wheat
strong
ale
almost
like
a
wheaty
duvel
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
very
pale
colored
beer
and
head
very
frothy
head
all
like
duvel
flavor
is
also
very
belgiany
maybe
from
the
wheat
more
than
the
yeast
but
this
beer
is
very
good
ill
get
it
again
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
with
tight
tickling
carbonation
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
creamy
yet
sweet
body
into
a
long
dry
finish
there
is
a
nice
hoppy
and
spicy
presence
up
front
with
hints
of
citrus
fruit
and
earthy
pine
which
is
excellently
balanced
by
a
sweet
crisp
fruit
character
slight
alcohol
heat
and
bready
yeast
hints
of
apple
pear
grape
and
banana
along
with
some
zesty
peppery
spice
and
coriander
very
complex
and
flavorful
with
a
long
dry
finish
that
leave
e
craving
another
sip
the
alcohol
is
very
faintly
evident
but
at
8
the
abv
is
excellently
masked
making
this
beer
dangerously
drinkable
excellent
off
tap
at
the
brewing
company
this
beer
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
billowing
threefingersworth
of
lemontinted
head
the
retention
was
good
and
the
head
became
rocky
over
time
leaving
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
lemons
spicy
hops
a
little
pepper
with
a
slightly
musty
note
of
yeast
the
flavors
were
fairly
light
for
8
5
but
refreshing
tart
in
a
way
similar
to
lemon
zest
further
accentuated
by
the
spiciness
of
saaz
hops
with
a
background
of
earthy
malt
and
a
good
presence
of
belgian
yeast
nice
wheat
notes
but
more
advanced
than
that
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
carbonation
appropriate
and
the
body
mediumlight
adventurous
and
magnificently
crafted
this
stuff
is
the
tits
i
had
this
before
on
tap
about
a
year
ago
to
the
date
of
this
writing
and
i
like
it
even
more
now
im
not
sure
if
thats
due
to
the
keg
being
a
bit
older
and
the
yeast
kicking
in
a
bitsupposodly
their
is
some
wild
yeast
in
this
but
i
would
kill
to
have
this
on
tap
at
my
house
in
the
springtime
very
smooth
body
in
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
overall
im
not
sure
american
pale
wheat
ale
does
this
beer
justice
saisonfarmhouse
is
probably
closer
to
what
white
gold
evokes
a
delicate
yet
fairly
complex
beer
one
im
totally
glad
i
picked
up
on
a
whim
at
wegmans
in
syracuse
ny
nice
amount
of
body
and
great
carb
on
this
one
overall
it
was
nice
but
i
felt
like
it
was
just
missing
something
or
maybe
i
was
a
nice
offering
but
ill
take
others
from
ithaca
over
this
any
day
md
very
light
crisp
very
drinkable
but
the
flavor
is
lacking
a
little
i
was
definitely
expecting
more
poured
a
brilliant
hazy
gold
color
with
great
carboantion
and
a
big
pillowy
head
nose
is
dry
wheat
hops
with
yeast
honey
light
floral
and
citrus
notes
taste
is
wheat
honey
light
citrus
small
dose
of
hops
and
some
good
ol
belgian
yest
mouthfell
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
good
slightly
hazy
amber
in
color
pours
with
half
inch
head
good
lacing
nondescript
smell
strong
taste
of
citrus
which
lasts
throughout
aftertaste
is
not
bitter
average
drinkability
slightly
on
the
heavy
side
for
the
beer
type
suprisingly
high
abc
of
eight
percent
the
kings
of
hop
i
was
excited
i
grab
this
one
up
the
other
day
expecting
some
much
more
than
it
ended
up
being
this
pale
wheat
with
francobelgian
leanings
some
nice
brettfunk
scertainly
looked
the
part
it
poured
a
lovely
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
good
bubbles
a
1
white
fluffy
head
but
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
nice
complex
in
its
lemon
orange
peel
white
pepper
grassy
herbal
notes
the
taste
was
crisp
medium
bodied
but
meh
in
flavor
there
were
light
notes
of
grainy
yeast
sour
hop
edges
farm
malts
but
only
if
really
paying
attention
overall
kinda
bland
for
something
so
promising
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
a
capped
750ml
bottle
share
with
psycohops
poured
into
a
pair
of
nonic
pint
glasses
the
ale
appears
a
hazed
golden
yellow
color
with
a
good
inch
or
so
of
pillowy
white
head
aromas
and
flavors
are
of
lemon
and
orange
peel
spicy
yeast
a
bit
tart
toasted
wheat
grassy
crisp
and
bubbly
with
just
about
moderate
carbonation
decent
stuff
good
beer
nothing
overly
exciting
pretty
drinkable
not
overly
complex
with
more
lemongrass
and
a
decent
hop
character
moderate
carbonation
very
grassy
and
earthy
with
some
pitted
fruits
drinkability
a
bit
pricey
at
around
10
but
i
liked
the
experimentation
and
all
they
tried
to
do
with
this
its
a
different
beer
which
melds
many
types
of
flavors
well
into
a
flavorful
and
crisp
and
good
for
the
end
of
summer
brew
as
the
cold
moves
in
looking
forward
to
more
in
the
series
as
i
can
find
them
md
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
with
a
taste
that
keeps
you
going
back
for
more
my
first
7oz
pour
is
already
gone
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
12
offwhite
head
over
the
effervescent
clear
golden
brew
head
snocones
above
the
rim
over
time
finally
calming
down
to
leave
chunky
bits
of
lacing
aroma
is
sedate
of
wheat
spices
and
citrus
taste
is
an
intensification
of
what
the
nose
hinted
at
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
prickly
for
my
taste
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
good
representative
of
the
style
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
me
of
the
three
ithaca
excelsior
beers
i
have
had
this
one
is
my
least
favorite
it
seemed
a
little
lacking
in
complexity
but
still
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
definetly
worth
checking
out
but
if
you
have
a
choice
go
with
either
ten
or
brute
as
they
are
superior
brews
overall
drinkability
is
good
but
slightly
hampered
by
the
overabundance
of
licorice
flavor
drinkability
a
unique
brew
at
8
0
abv
its
certainly
no
traditional
pale
wheat
ale
this
one
defies
classification
really
with
a
motley
crew
of
yeast
strains
intercontinental
malts
and
hops
and
a
soupcon
of
imagination
to
boot
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
not
sure
what
i
was
expecting
really
but
i
could
see
myself
trying
this
one
again
should
it
make
itself
available
at
8
0
im
still
able
to
type
after
finishing
off
the
bottle
always
a
plus
though
it
is
somewhat
hefty
i
liken
this
somewhat
to
a
softer
more
bitter
version
of
the
southhampton
grand
cru
both
had
those
intensely
spicy
belgian
notes
going
on
though
this
one
seems
to
be
a
little
more
sticky
syrupy
sugary
sweet
either
way
recommended
drinks
pretty
nice
but
the
abv
complexity
of
this
do
hinder
me
a
bit
loved
the
francobelgian
flair
of
this
makes
me
think
tripel
slightly
better
in
the
bottle
but
whats
left
are
old
bottles
quite
interesting
wheat
beers
are
not
always
my
favorite
but
this
was
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
d
in
some
ways
it
just
feels
like
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
too
many
things
at
once
with
the
wheat
malt
the
hops
and
the
different
types
of
yeast
they
blend
together
to
make
an
enjoyable
warm
weather
brew
but
one
that
might
be
improved
with
a
little
more
focus
i
would
probably
pair
this
beer
with
a
creamy
buttery
blue
cheese
and
some
fresh
fruit
like
a
pear
a
peach
or
some
strawberries
the
drink
is
crisp
and
quaffable
with
a
firm
medium
body
and
spoton
belgianesque
carbonation
white
gold
is
my
latest
encounter
with
a
representative
brew
from
ithacas
outstanding
excelsior
series
and
this
particular
member
of
the
family
is
every
bit
as
impressive
damned
tasty
and
satisfying
as
the
rest
i
would
rank
this
up
there
with
some
of
my
other
favorites
franciscaner
and
weihenstephaner
a
light
wheat
malt
brew
with
hot
cinnemon
and
ginger
crispness
is
the
first
impression
the
wonderfully
complex
yeasts
gives
many
authentic
belgian
brews
a
run
for
the
money
in
complexity
the
yeast
has
a
robust
wild
flavor
with
lots
of
earthiness
and
succulant
fruits
the
depth
of
the
yeast
and
hops
is
really
bold
the
light
wheat
malt
adds
just
the
right
balance
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
yeast
flavors
without
being
from
an
abbey
the
american
english
and
wild
yeast
adds
up
to
impressive
a
crisp
zippy
feel
and
slightly
dry
you
can
taste
the
wild
variety
in
the
finish
most
heat
is
well
hidden
but
effective
the
buzz
is
rather
intense
so
dont
let
this
one
fool
you
thanks
to
dr
dogbeer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
fairly
good
beer
overall
but
whether
im
looking
for
a
belgianstyle
americanstyle
or
a
wheat
beer
thats
a
combination
thereof
there
are
definitely
others
that
i
would
pick
first
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
spotty
pattern
of
belgian
lacing
left
behind
the
smell
is
bright
lemon
pepper
and
classic
wheat
malt
fragrances
visible
effervescent
the
first
pour
is
almost
champagnelike
with
lightermedium
body
full
flavored
the
taste
matches
the
nose
and
is
complemented
nicely
by
the
textures
tangy
and
slightly
tart
on
the
dry
side
while
the
brightness
lingers
appropriately
very
refreshing
and
a
really
nice
drinker
the
8
abv
is
well
integrated
in
the
swallow
yet
warms
slightly
on
the
way
down
highly
recommended
a
very
flavorful
pale
wheat
ale
which
is
certainly
saying
something
positive
for
this
offering
flavorful
balanced
and
very
drinkable
as
i
would
have
guessed
the
alcohol
by
volume
to
be
well
under
6
drinkability
very
good
the
beer
isnt
as
complex
as
it
puts
on
but
it
is
quenching
and
easy
to
drink
very
nice
dthis
is
a
pretty
good
brew
that
is
easy
to
drink
it
drinks
like
a
typical
sessionable
wheat
beerso
the
abv
is
very
sneaky
this
has
a
much
milder
less
exciting
character
than
many
of
this
style
but
is
still
a
pretty
good
beeractuallyi
split
this
with
my
mom
and
she
loved
it
its
a
great
classic
wheat
beer
that
doesnt
get
wild
or
crazy
in
anyway
except
for
abv
d
high
drinkability
due
to
easy
drinking
and
light
body
alcohol
sneaks
up
definitely
this
one
is
better
than
half
the
wines
ive
had
why
did
i
think
that
last
sentence
was
important
when
i
was
taking
notes
drinkability
this
brew
is
a
serious
change
of
pace
i
really
liked
it
from
the
first
sip
and
the
last
sip
was
pretty
damned
good
too
im
not
sure
what
else
to
say
about
it
really
just
plain
good
stuff
thanks

this
is
a
beer
that
is
not

to
fit

it

has
some
european
influence
which
i
guess
makes
it
a
cross
between
a

an
american

very
unique

very

for
a

since
wheats
are
not
my
favorite
style
having
it
meshed
with
an
american
ale
which
i
would
swear
had
some
belgian
yeast
in
it
as
well
made
it
drinkable
would
pair
well
with
a
garlic
and
olive
oil
pasta
pretty
nicely
a
winner
from
ithaca
brewing
company
the
spices
and
esters
are
kept
in
check
enough
to
make
this
one
excellent
wheat
beer
the
complexity
is
huge
and
the
flavors
are
stacked
on

of
each
other
perfectly
thanks
for
the
bottles
paul
and
adam
this
one
is
damn
tasty
and
way
under
the
radar
peeps
feel
is
well
carbonated
giving
a
light
and
airy
quality
dangerously
quaffable
more
of
a
belgian
than
american
beer
a
good
beer
that
i
wont
be
purchasing
again
due
to
the
price
tag
a
slighty
boozy
creamy
mouthfeel
just
average

decent

overall

charles
overall
very
nice
with
a
light
dry
finish
and
an
easy
drinking
for
an
8
beer
this
was
not
my
favorite
of
the
series
but
i
truly
cannot
say
a
bad
thing
about
it
the
light
citrus
hop
taste
was
a
nice
added
touch
to
it
and
really
brought
the
whole
thing
together
i
would
definitely
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
drinkability
is
average
this
is
just
another
strong
wheat
beer
all
the
aspects
of
a
nicer
thirst
quencher
but
the
overt
strength
really
presents
a
challenge
i
totally
forgot
there
was
any
brett
its
a
total
nonfactor
at
this
point
no
idea
of
the
age
i
just
bought
it
in
boston
i
had
higher
hopes
in
spite
of
not
caring
for
ten
but
this
was
another
overpriced
underproducing
brew
from
excelsior
im
always
a
big
supporter
of
any
brewers
reserve
style
beers
but
a
little
qa
goes
a
long
way
as
far
as
not
putting
out
the
first
recipe
you
think
of
not
cheap
and
not
to
good
1
and
done
thank
you
very
much
d
more
bottles
seriously
wish
i
had
more
good
thing
they
are
still
making
this
glad
i
laid
this
one
down
dont
know
how
much
longer
it
will
improve
but
time
definitely
changed
this
beer
drinks
very
well
smooth
and
fulfilling
all
the
way
this
guy
is
a
winner
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
a
huge
white
foamy
head
the
head
lasts
forever
and
leaves
great
lacing
the
smell
is
somewhat
pungent
with
a
hint
of
clovebananawheatand
lemon
the
taste
is
full
of
hop
crispness
with
clovesbananawheatand
lemon
the
mf
is
light
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
especially
for
a
high
alcohol
brew
a
damn
good
beernot
the
best
but
something
that
should
be
tried
if
you
can
find
it
the
beer
is
quite
carbonated
and
very
complex
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
is
a
pleasure
to
review
because
it
changes
in
subtle
ways
with
each
drink
the
beer
does
have
a
high
abv
which
does
leave
a
bit
of
a
throaty
aftertaste
lchaim
there
is
not
much
in
the
way
of
distinctly
brettanomyces
derived
flavors
here
though
they
could
be
influencing
the
musty
earthy
aspects
of
this
beer
though
this
could
just
as
likely
be
from
a
characterful
saccharomyces
strain
this
is
a
tasty
beer
though
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
aroma
comes
off
a
bit
more
intriguingly
than
the
taste
but
only
just
this
beer
finishes
like
nothing
ive
had
before
it
almost
seems
as
if
someone
has
taken
a
decent
belgian
and
combined
it
with
a
glass
of
champagne
if
it
tasted
more
like
orange
juice
it
would
remind
me
of
christmas
morning
very
dry
finish
also
does
well
to
disguise
the
8
abv
this
is
a
very
well
made
beer
this
gets
better
and
better
with
warmth
maybe
it
doesnt
blow
the
doors
off
with
overabundance
of
ingredients
but
this
is
very
comforting
wellrounded
and
enjoyable
while
being
quite
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
very
nice
on
this
beer
very
smooth
and
balanced
wheat
beer
that
is
incredibly
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
also
has
enough
taste
that
it
never
gets
boring
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
during
a
nice
day
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
nice
one
inch
head
nice
gold
color
with
a
little
cloudiness
the
wild
yeast
hasnt
had
time
yet
to
do
their
thing
this
beer
would
definitely
evolve
with
a
little
aging
that
being
said
this
is
very
drinkable
now
with
a
very
dry
finish
overall
very
nice
had
again
2
5
years
later
on
tap
and
found
it
astringent
wheat
pours
a
very
hazy
gold
color
plenty
of
sediment
here
a
good
size
bright
white
head
slowly
recedes
aroma
is
some
nice
lemon
and
orange
citrus
perfumy
floral
aroma
spicey
and
yeasty
wheat
is
evident
as
well
in
the
aroma
but
is
fairly
subdued
taste
shows
a
nice
mixture
of
soft
and
sweet
nutty
wheat
along
with
some
good
citrus
notes
honey
sweetness
as
well
spicy
and
crisp
towards
the
finish
with
a
dry
grassy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
soft
feel
up
front
followed
by
a
good
tingle
of
spiciness
on
the
tongue
a
little
alcohol
warmth
in
the
drying
hoppy
finish
a
good
beer
for
sure
would
love
a
little
more
body
but
overall
a
refreshing
yet
potent
wheat
thanks
to
adam
for
the
opportunity
bottom
line
this
is
about
as
close
to
perfection
in
the
style
that
im
probably
ever
going
find
so
let
the
scores
fall
where
they
may
wonderful
drop
overall
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
ithaca
should
be
proud
of
it
is
part
of
their
exclesior
series
and
let
me
say
it
is
for
good
reason
a
great
brew
from
ithaca
definitely
a
surprise
at
how
good
this
one
is
really
hides
the
8
abv
fantastic
cheers
finally
something
a
little
higher
class
from
ithaca
keep
these
beers
coming
thanks
beertruth
for
the
opportunity
this
was
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
it
had
some
dry
white
winelike
characteristics
it
seemed
to
me
given
the
very
low
level
of
sweetness
and
the
higher
level
of
bitterness
different
for
sure
and
worth
a
try
drinkability
its
fine
for
a
beer
of
intertwined
styles
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
yesty
citrusy
with
a
dry
finish
m
stellar
carbonation
and
lots
of
wheat
make
this
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
cool
brew
thanks
to

sending
it

a

the

in
this
brew
really
show
thru
in
the
nosea
belgian
yeasty
slightly
smokey
and
tropical
fruity
notes
really
show
thru
upfront
and
then
a
real
noticable
floral
and
sharp
american
hop
profile
comes
thru
and
really
stands
out
very
nice
with
equal
billing
to
both
wow
complex
to
the
hilt
its
sharp
and
spicey
at
one
point
and
soft
and
fruity
nextone
thing
is
for
sure
the
hops
ring
thru
in
a
nice
lingering
finish
the
belgian
yeast
component
upfront
with
its
slight
smokiness
and
spice
just
overpower
or
even
come
close
to
that
everything
just
melds
nicelyvery
well
done
with
more
of
the
excelsior
brews
coming
in
soo
according
to
the
rep
at
my
local
consumers
i
will
jump
to
get
them
for
sure
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
the
old
habit
d
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
beer
are
fantastic
and
something
i
would
love
to
try
again
if
i
can
only
muster
up
the
beer
budget
to
make
it
down
to
ibc
for
another
bottle
mediumlight
body
and
mouthfeel
smooth
and
very
drinkable
a
tad
undrinable
thanks
to
the
alcohol
this
beer
should
be
due
for
some
aging
in
my
opinion
to
mellow
out
the
bite
to
it
a
touch
out
of
balance
thanks
to
the
alcohol
has
some
aspects
of
a
farmhouse
saison
an
abbey
ale
and
an
american
wheat
rolled
into
one
fantastic
combination
my
review
does
little
justice
to
the
depth
of
this
brew
i
highly
recommend
it
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
fruity
zest
and
slight
coriander
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
dry
earthy
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
fruity
with
a
wheat
malt
edge
its
crisp
and
refreshing
a
nice
spring
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
brew
and
a
welcome
change
from
the
regular
lineup
keep
up
the
good
work
so
here
goes
pours
a
murky
straw
color
with
a
white
fluffy
head
that
dies
down
to
almost
nothing
soon
after
pour
lacing
is
somewhat
spotty
here
and
there
on
the
glass
smell
is
that
of
mild
banana
with
a
hint
of
lemonlime
peels
i
also
detected
a
bit
of
honey
that
tickles
the
nose
once
and
a
while
taste
is
very
much
the
same
as
the
odor
but
the
banana
flavor
is
hardly
present
more
of
a
hoppy
citrus
flavor
than
a
wheaty
malt
taste
i
think
the
strong
pale
shines
more
in
the
flavor
of
the
brew
while
the
wheat
ale
is
more
powerful
in
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
quite
dry
but
not
overly
dry
carbonation
is
just
about
nothing
to
the
eye
but
is
very
present
on
the
tougne
very
clean
going
down
the
balance
in
this
brew
is
just
about
perfect
i
love
the
drinkability
of
this
brew
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
with
the
grill
cookin
pick
this
one
up
for
sure
as
well
as
the
ipabbey
when
and
if
you
can
make
it
to
the
ithaca
area
good
work
once
again
chief
and
the
ithaca
beer
co
crew
pours
a
goldenyellow
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
what
would
be
excepted
which
is
of
sweet
wheat
grains
for
the
most
part
pretty
much
the
same
for
the
taste
with
a
very
light
dry
finish
different
than
other
similar
brews
and
close
to
the
goose
island
312
urban
wheat
lighterbodied
with
perfect

overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
cheers
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink

doesnt
have
much
in
the

attract

the

of
what
was

i
do
not

i
would

this
again
unless
it
was

id
pass
o
not
a
horrible
beer
by
any

but
not
one
i
would
choose
to
be
my
goto
it
does
have
a
lovely
complexity
between
the
malt
and
fruit
but
it
lacks
in
other
areas
the
nose
is
certainly
the
best
feature
of
this
brew
this
poured
out
as
a
very
pale
and
clear
looking
light
yellow
color
the
head
was
white
with
hardly
any
retention
and
no
lacing
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
with
grain
some
wheat
and
corn
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
here
on
this
the
sweetness
is
there
as
well
as
the
corn
and
a
subtle
breadiness
also
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
modestly
carbonated
and
kind
of
watery
overall
the
beer
is
decent
but
nothing
something
i
would
need
to
have
again
overall
this
is
just
a
very
simple
wheat
ale
no
special
ingrdients
just
mostly
a
plain
wheat
flavor
its
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
just
unsophisticated
is
all
o
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
impress
me
id
like
more
hops
flavor
and
aroma
an
average
american
wheat
great
tasty
wheat
with
moderate

i

for

drinking
not
enough
carbonation
to
really
give
the
mouth
feel
that
is
needed
overall
ok
to
drink
but
the
beer
itself
could
be
mistaken
for
a
lager
strange
o
a
fairly
average
american
wheat
beer
apparently
brewed
for
mass
appeal
while
quite
quaffable
and
refreshing
for
a
hot
day
wheat
monkey
remains
little
more
than
an
average
wheat
beer
suitable
for
the
masses
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
depth
or
uniqueness
skip
this
one
and
grab
yourself
a
wisconsinite
do
this
wheat
beer
is
likely
to
disappear
completely
amongst
others
of
its
style
with
no
distinguishing
or
particularly
attractive
features
to
set
it
apart
the
harsh
acidity
that
dominates
its
flavor
profile
volunteers
some
palatescrubbing
features
but
ultimately
goes
overboard
in
its
intensity
it
lacks
artful
qualities
instead
putting
far
too
much
emphasis
on
apology
body
is
mediumlight
in
heft
carbonation
is
moderate
and
causes
the
beer
to
foam
up
pleasantly
on
the
palate
easily
drinkable
somewhat
watery
finish
is
semidry
o
straight
forward
clear
view
of
what
a
gentle
fresh
summer
brew
should
be
doesnt
overstep
boundaries
and
be
a
wild
adventure
just
a
relaxing
quaff
overall
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
okay
its
american
its
pale
its
wheaty
and
its
ostensibly
an
ale
its
the
real
deal
even
if
that
seems
all
too
anticlimactic
perhaps
a
little
out
of
season
more
suited
for
a
hot
summer
day
opposed
to
this
chilly
fall
evening
low
abv
summer
patio
beer
with
little
to
separate
from
the
herd
smells
and
tastes
like
a
lager
with
the
wheat
not
very
noticeable
in
the
flavours
no
real
complaints
as
it
does
what
is
made
for
entry
level
beer
for
bbqs
and
parties
but
i
fail
to
want
to
buy
this
again
on
tap
at
the
brewery
good
marketing
but
this
is
an
american
sour
wheat
not
so
drinkable
not
as
big
a
head
as
i
expected
sweetish
malty
aroma
not
as
good
as
it
smells
citrus
hops
do
not
save
it
apparently
many
people
do
not
like
this
and
so
a
belgian

is
available

with
a

and
taste
however
the
taste
being
the
weaker
of
the
two
mediumlight
body
moderately
carbonated
neither
bad
nor
outstanding
drinkable
certainly
overall
another
fairly
nondescript
beer
from
the
8sampler
pack
o
american
pale
wheats
arnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
definitely
didnt
find
anything
offensive
in
here
easy
to
drink
and
somewhat
of
a
lawnmower
beer
aroma
is
some
wheat
faint
cookie
and
cinnamon
really
faint
very
light
with
minimal
cookie
and
wheat
taste
very
limited
o
mindless
downer
wont
give
much
second
thought
when
consuming
nor
receive
much
praise
during
consumption
a
basic
wheat
meant
to
delivery
basic
no
thrill
results
manageable
for
a
few
o
overall
this
one
does
exactly
what
it
is
intended
to
do
it
is
a
light
bodied
drinkable
wheat
beer
that
is
perfect
for
the
hot
summer
months
i
feel
that
giving
this
beer
an
average
rating
is
a
bit
generous
the
cloudy
orange
color
and
white
cap
looked
good
but
the
almost
complete
lack
carbonation
seemed
peculiar
the
aroma
had
some
orange
and
lemon
on
top
of
the
wheat
which
was
light
the
taste
was
unimpressive
the
wheat
and
citrus
seemed
thin
to
the
point
i
could
almost
taste
the
water
thin
we
has
it
i
have
had
several
similar
brews
that
were
better
examples
of
the
style
and
just
plain
more
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
its
wellcarbonated
and
pretty
light
the
drinkability
of
course
is
quite
good
its
a
pale
wheat
ale
if
its
not
drinkable
somethings
terribly
wrong
overall
a
pretty
good
pale
what
nothing
outstanding
but
perfectly
serviceable
with
an
excellent
aftertaste
generally
i
prefer
jethro
tulls
steel
monkey
as
many
have
said
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
hot

sorry
to

this
came
off

eh
d
i

it
was
drinkable

would
probably
pass
by

if
i
found
it
in

still
a
very
good

beer
a
nice
and
simple
beer
that
is
largely
error
free
i
would

the

to
completely

without
the

lawnmower
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
some
fruity
yeast
esters
and
some
banana
in
the
nose
good
balance
for
the
style
a
long
lasting
grassy
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
although
the
banana
flavor
dominates
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
very
light
and
pretty
drinkable
there
are
better
options
in
the
style
but
this
is
a
well
made
offering
that
is
worth
a
try
for
fans
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
dry
musty
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
horrible
yeast
aroma
its
bone
dry
with
a
touch
of
citrus
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
along
with
a
dry
citrusy
finish
its
not
overly
tasty
or
complex
and
it
does
have
an
offputting
musty
character
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
forgettable
wheat
beer
its
light
but
lacking
flavor
and
is
full
of
flaws
i
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
an
extremely
light
color
so
light
its
almost
clear
i
could
see
my
fingers
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
no
head
to
speak
of
but
the
lacing
was
pretty
nice
i
couldnt
catch
much
in
the
scent
just
a
faint
smell
of
wheat
disappointing
for
a
beer
that
looked
so
light
this
has
a
surprisingly
nice
body
to
it
unfortunately
the
body
didnt
have
a
taste
to
match
it
was
pretty
bland
with
just
a
hint
of
wheat
and
fruit
last
night
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
it
was
much
better
then
it
was
bottled
i
rated
the
taste
a
little
bit
higher
just
because
i
wonder
if
i
got
an
older
batch
in
these
bottles
from
all
the
brews
from
lakefront
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
keeping
in
mind
i
have
not
tried
their
ipa
yet
drinkability
is
good
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
as
long
as
lakefront
remains
consistent
in
the
final
product
something
that
has
been
somewhat
of
a
problem
for
them
in
the
past
all
together
this
is
a
drinkable
and
pleasant
wheat
ale
cheers
for
what
it
is
its
great
id
put
this
against
any
other
american
style
wheat
out
there
d
a
solid
wheat
beer
that
has
what
you
want
and
should
have
for
the
style
great
for
summer
a
6pk
wouldnt
stand
a
chance
lakefront
can
do
better
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
falls
to
a
thin
cap
aroma
is
of
cloves
and
coriander
light
bodied
with
a
sweet
malt
base
that
leads
to
fruity
esters
and
has
a
pleasant
wheat
finish
rather
low
carbonation
for
a
beer
of
this
style
the
flavors
are
very
delicate
it
didnt
hold
up
at
all
to
food
however
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
overall
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
the
purple
cartoon
monkey
on
the
packaging
with
a
name
like
wheat
monkey
i
was
expecting
it
to
taste
more
like
a
hefeweiss
with
some
banana
flavor
from
the
yeast
of
course
this
isnt
a
hefeweiss
at
all
and
it
clearly
states
so
with
wheat
ale
printed
on
the
package
thats
disappointing
overall
the
beer
was
refreshing
and
tasty
it
had
just
enough
hoppy
flavor
to
make
it
interesting
without
making
it
too
bitter
for
a
wheat
beer
it
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
love
it
when
a
beer
exceeds
my
expectations
the
name
and
packaging
of
trout
slayer
appeal
to
my
fishing
problem
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
this
beer
pours
with
enough
head
to
remind
you
its
had
its
wheaties
the
color
is
a
beautiful
gold
and
the
nose
is
full
of
wheat
goodness
the
taste
is
bright
full
of
citrus
and
fresh
baked
bread
tasting
trout
slayer
is
like
finding
a
big
cutty
in
six
inches
of
water
a
very
pleasant
surprise
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
this
is
very
clean
for
a
wheat
without
the
big
esters
found
in
many
european
interpretations
the
nose
is
herbal
and
citrus
with
more
hop
action
than
yeast
it
pours
crystal
clear
pale
gold
and
the
thick
fluffy
head
confirms
the
presence
of
wheat
along
with
the
rich
texture
grainy
malt
on
the
palate
carries
hoppy
spice
into
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
easy
to
drink
its
an
outstanding
american
wheat
ale
o
nice
light
wheat
ale
but
not
overly
complex
or
special
would
indeed
be
very
nice
while
fishing
final
thoughts
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
which
i
suppose
is
the
whole
point
of
a
wheat
ale
nicely
done
by
a
brewery
that
surprises
me
a
little
bit
with
every
offering
i
try
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
3
75
overall
a
drinkable
if
not
exceptional
beer
this
one
paired
well
with
a
traditional
jamaican
jerked
chicken
at
a
spicy
level
overall
not
a
bad
brew
not
great
but
not
bad
plenty
of
other
brews
of
this
style
are
much
better
for
the
same
money
its
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
get
too
wound
up
about
it
overall
a
solid
beer
thats
perfect
for
the
summer
85100
overall
nothing
too
outstanding
but
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
none
the
less
a
sort
of
average
wheat
ale
overall
flavor
buttery
white
rolls
grassy
wheat
some
surprising
bitter
citrus
hop
flavor
in
the
middle
and
finish
d
a
decent
session
beer
nice
in
what
it
offers
but
very
straightforward
i
normally
do
not
try
wheat
beers
and
i
was
not
going
to
buy
this
but
god
am
i
glad
i
did
this
is
a
really
terrific
beer
i
honestly
think
this
beer
is
underrated
on
this
site
this
is
defiantly
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
and
i
will
definitely
buy
again
and
recommend
to
everyone
all
in
all
a
very
good
wheat
not
great
but
very
good
flavorful
but
not
heavy
plenty
of
nuances
but
not
overbearing
id
drink
this
again
and
probably
while
im
fishing
it
has
a
great
fishing
label
thats
as
cool
as
this
beer
is
good
oi
think
this
would
pair
well
with
a
summer
barbecue
chicken
more
than
a
stand
alone
beer
i
would
likely
purchase
on
tap
if
eating
with
a
tangy
barbecue
chicken
pours
a
golden
yellow
in
color
with
close
to
a
finger
of
a
white
head
that
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
with
some
citrus
maybe
lemon
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
perfect
wheat
flavor
with
some
citrus
peel
for
the
finish
with
a
light
taste
of
honey
also
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
with
no
bitter
aftertaste
at
all
perfect
carbonation
great
yeararound
brew
o
definitely
recommended
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
this
is
a
great
american
wheat
beer
its
hard
to
beat
boulevard
unfiltered
wheat
ale
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
worth
a
shot
ive
enjoyed
the
two
beers
ive
tried
from
big
sky
so
far
great
bottle
art
too
moose
drool
is
great
for
brown
ale
fans
one
of
the
most
interesting
wheat
ales
that
i
have
ever
had
tons
of
flavor
packed
into
this
5
0
abv
beer
would
love
to
drink
this
really
cold
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
too
bad
i
cant
get
it
back
in
ct
o
straightforward
easy
drinking
ale
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
hoppy
lager
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
decent
sized
foamy
creamcolored
head
that
settled
after
a
bit
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
yellow
with
several
lazy
bubble
trails
aroma
is
primarily
hops
plus
citrus
yeast
spice
flavors
like
nose
also
has
bold
carbonic
tang
that
works
well
with
the
hop
bitter
quite
dry
and
clean
body
is
just
right
with
bright
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
of
average
length
and
very
drinkable
o
overall
this
is
a
great
session
beer
its
low
abv
make
it
a
perfect
take
along
on
my
next
fishing
trip
i
also
feel
that
this
beer
is
a
great
way
to
introduce
craft
beer
to
adjunct
drinkers
this
beer
is
also
a
good
food
companion
since
it
leaves
a
clean
finsh
i
enjoyed
this
unique
interpretation
of
a
summer
wheat
ale
probably
because
i
really
like
german
dunkel
weiss
big
wheat
bread
notes
up
front
high
carbonation
keeps
things
lively
ends
dry
and
nutty
some
faint
tart
berry
notes
and
some
nice
bitter
citrus
interplay
this
is
a
very
good
wheat
beer
it
has
a
nice
malt
bill
and
more
hop
bitterness
than
most
overalli
like
the
color
everything
else
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
the
verdict
not
bad
a
decent
wheat
beer
without
any
flaws
but
theres
also
nothing
to
get
excited
about
just
a
good
solid
brew
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
the
aroma
of
this
beer
actually
overwhelms
you
in
their
tasting
room
where
they
are
serving
a
lot
of
other
brews
it
also
has
a
head
that
wont
quit
i
really
like
this
beer
an
incredible
pale
wheat
ale
a
nice
big
flavor
a
pleasant
hop
presence
and
a
great
first
beer
ive
had
out
of
montana
you
have
to
try
this
one
overall
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
wheat
ale
o
good
beer
ive
had
better
from
big
sky
i
could
imagine
putting
a
few
of
these
back
whilst
flicking
a
jig
pours
a
clear
golden
with
almost
no

then
some

by
some

very
nice

and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
with
plenty
of
flavor
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
usually
dont
like
beers
with
deceiving
names
but
big
skys
trout
slayer
is
one
exception
this
is
what
i
call
a
mild
wheat
beer
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
the
smell
was
a
tad
unusual
with
hints
of
grape
and
apple
it
almost
smelled
like
a
cider
besides
that
aspect
i
enjoyed
drinking
the
trout
slayer
drinking
a
few
of
these
will
make
you
believe
youre
a
decent
fly
fisherman
now
go
slay
some
trout
poured
this
american
wheat
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
nice
white
head
great
retention
and
excellent
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
fresh
baked
bread
medium
bodied
there
is
a
foundation
of
malted
wheat
floral
hop
flavor
and
it
has
a
semi
dry
finish
great
session
beer
smooth
and
a
big
dose
of
hops
probably
my
favoirte
american
pale
wheat
ale
again
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
would
be
great
on
a
hot
afternoon
but
for
the
price
give
me
a
hop
hog
any
day
very
drinkable
but
not
exceptional
overall
for
a
weak
abv
strawcolored
whatever
they
wanna
call
it
its
okay
can
drink
many
in
succession
for
certain
but
would
you
want
to
there
is
a
certain
richness
to
it
as
a
hefe
might
be
so
that
may
slow
down
your
session
but
its
drinkable
its
likable
its
way
better
than
the
commercial
crap
i
was
originally
comparing
it
to
for
montana
i
imagine
this
might
be
a
ladys
beer
i
was
quite
surprised
by
this
thirst
quenching
and
crisp
in
exactly
the
way
i
was
looking
for
very
nice
ok
for
a
wheat
beer
refreshing
and
a
good
summer
brew
12oz

pours
clearer

yeasty
faintly
herbal
tastes
are
wheat
lemongrass
yeast
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
smooth
overall
i
thought
this
was
slightly
better
than
average
for
the
style
o
a
tad
on
the
bitter
and
dry
side
for
a
wheat
offering
the
contrast
between
the
smell
and
the
taste
is
quite
perplexing
it
certainly
gives
me
pause
especially
without
a
date
on
the
label
3

not
bad
for
the
american
wheat
style
but
not
a
memorable
beer
experience
devoid
of
any
yeasty

estery
flavors

clean
and
well
made
from
the
12

good
quaff

there
is

each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
like
the
hopped
up
version
of
a
wheat
beer
that
they
are
putting
out
here
overall
an
excellent
apw
great
for
hot
days
but
thered
be
no
hesitation
to
drink
it
any
time
of
the
year
beats
the
hell
out
of
sn
old
chico
a
much
better
than
average
wheat
beer
smells
less
fruity
and
yeasty
than
most
just
a
big
nose
of
fresh
pale
and
wheat
malts
balanced
by
a
mild
hop
bitterness
flavor
is
right
on
with
the
nose
really
crisp
and
refreshing
when
ice
cold
some
lemony
notes
to
the
hop
profile
but
this
is
faint
a
great
summer
beer
that
still
has
some
meat
on
its
bones
feel
is
nice
lighter
medium
body
and
fizzy
sodalike
carbonation
very
very
easy
drinking
and
at
the
low
abv
this
is
an
all
day
drinking
beer
perfect
for
the
long
days
ahead
of
us
i
will
likely
purchase
more
6packs
of
this
as
summer
advances
very
drinkable
and
rewarding
quite

packed
and
a
deceptive

comes

drinking
the

wheat
from

is
a
decent
beer
probably
better
on
a
warmer
day
than
the
winter

trying

the

poured
a

it

overall
not
a

for
me
give
me
pbr
or
something
else
cheap
for
a
light

cost
is
a
big
factor
for

overall
i
would
say
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
that
i
have
sampled
i
would
definately
buy
this
one
again
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
an
alternative
to
other
thicker
wheat
beers
like
boulevard
it
light
and
yet
its
very
flavorful
if
you
are
thirsty
it
will
quench
your
thirst
also
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
like
anything
wheat
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
pale
wheat
ales
nice
pour
into
a
pint
glass
thick
foamy

that
last
through
out
golden
with
a
hint
of

aromas
of
fruit
grain
and
mild

mellow
taste
of
carmel

dried

and
a
slight
metallic
finish
easy
drinking
wheat
ale
only
bought
one
wish
i
had
one
more
overall
i
would
drink
this
one
again
i
think
on

it
would
be
better

my

the
other
he
couldnt
stand
it
little
to
no
buzz
off
a
5
thinking
i
got
a
struck
batch
or
something
looked
appealing
tasted
ok
would
not
try
it
again
unless
on
tap
or
canned
another
enjoyable
ale
from
montana
the
aroma
is
wheaty
peppery
and
slightly
citric
in
character
the
flavor
combines
some
light
white
pepper
phenols
with
lime
and
orange
notes
a
little
grassy
and
a
little
grainy
too
the
feel
is
smooth
and
wellcarbonated
with
the
consistency
rounding
out
the
feel
nicely
overall
this
is
a
reasonably
good
offering
for
the
style
but
again
i
just
feel
like
a
great
one
of
these
could
offer
more
overall
what
an
excellent
wheat
ale
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
this
is
better
than
the
more
mainstream
alternatives
it
is
a
very
complex
and
flavorful
ale
not
shying
away
from
hops
and
that
is
something
i
personally
like
great
beer
glad
i
bought
it
you
should
to
o
overall
a
great
drinking
beer
great
for
a
session
beer
i
would
like
to
say
that
what
i
just
drank
was
interesting
but
not
something
i
would
buy
again
overall
drinkability
havent
had
many
in
this
style
but
i
can
instantly
recognize
that
this
is
middle
of
the
road
at
best
due
to
the
undesirable
off
characters
and
lack
of
positives
o
overall
a
decent
beer
that
compares
favorably
with
other
example
of
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
other
wheat
pale
ales
very
creamy
but
not
overwhelmingly
heavy
like
others
can
be
would
recommend
for
an
open
minded
drinker
but
not
for
someone
hung
up
on
unfiltered
wheats
this
one
is
a
little
special
o
this
beer
ended
up
being
just
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
not
terrible
just
not
great
the
malt
profile
is
nicely
unoffensive
and
i
could
probably
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
my
only
real
complaint
about
this
beer
is
the
name
such
an
epic
name
for
a
nonepic
beer
o
wheat
beer
with
nothing
that
stands
out
o
really
happy
with
this
beer
makes
me
wish
it
wasnt
so
cold
outside
i
found
it
really
good
for
the
style
o
good
beer
for
hot
weather
light
and
refreshing
with
some
good
flavor
thanks
again
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
1
5
inch
head
smell
is
bready
some
banana
and
spice
taste
is
of
wheat
and
grains
a
touch
of
spice
to
it
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
good
quality
beer
the
floral
hop
nature
shows
through
somewhat
better
in
the
taste
than
in
the
nose
otherwise
most
of
the
flavor
is
what
you
see
in
the
nose
sweet
sharp
wheat
grains
balanced
well
with
noblestyle
floral
and
earth
presence
kept
simple
but
done
relatively
well
i
almost
forgot
to
mention
that
the
pale
wheat
bill
on
this
one
seems
slightly
heartier
than
your
typical
witbier
as
well
like
it
was
just
a
wee
bit
higher
gravity
than
the
statistically
average
witbier
if
you
know
what
i
mean
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
well
carbonated
and
crisp
i
certainly
appreciate
the
slightly
bolder
than
typical
flavors
that
come
from
this
one
o
i
like
this
wheat
definitely
easy
drinking
great
beer
to
give
someone
that
would
like
to
try
something
different
other
than
their
usual
bland
lagers
overall
impression
good
wheat
beer
with
nice
hop
taste
not
sure
how
big
of
a
fan
i
am
of
this
one
but
time
will
tell
im
going
to
be
getting
this
in
bottleontap
as
soon
as
i
see
it
dr
good
price
fair
quality
and
decent
drinkability
this
is
one
to
try
if
you
dont
pay
too
much
for
it
but
its
far
from
special
or
bold
o
goes
down
easy
could
be
a
good
candidate
for
a
drinking
session
or
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
special
really
very
easy
drinking
though
was
done
with
it
in
about
5
minutes
while
sitting
on
my
back
deck
overall
a
rather
dull
brew
the
search
will
continue
o
good
for
what
it
is
a
very
basic
overall
wheat
to
drink
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
floating
the
river
props
for
th
name
and
the
artwork
on
the
can
well
after
plugging
through
the
rest
of
them
it
kinda
grew
on
me
i
shared
with
the
neighbor
and
we
had
a
little
debate
about
the
brew
i
might
have
been
a
little
harsh
at
first
glance
but
i
upped
my
ratings
on
it
really
like
this
as
a
hot
weather
session
beer
and
the
fact
that
it
is
in
a
can
means
i
would
take
it
camping
or
on
some
other
outdoor
activity
in
a
heartbeat
d
maybe
not
the
best
big
sky
offering
or
example
of
the
style
but
good
this
is
a
clean
cut
straight
forward
beer
easy
drinking
and
smooth
any
bmc
drinker
could
put
a
couple
away
without
being
scared
of
a
craft
beer
brilliant
yellow
with
a
tight
light
head
slightly
fruity
nose
with
reasonble
hop
profile
good
smack
of
bittering
and
piney
hops
no
citrus
profile
to
speak
of
an
enjoyable
session
beer
great
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
very
light
golden
amber
with
nice
clarity
and
a
fluffy
head
leaving
thick
curtains
the
nose
brings
simple
bready
malts
with
almost
a
weird
sea
salt
note
along
with
a
vanilla
malt
shake
smell
as
well
taste
brings
more
bready
malts
with
a
smoke
seaweed
taste
without
much
else
definitely
different
for
the
style
but
not
really
in
a
good
way
overall
easily
my
favorite
pale
wheat
ale
a
delicious
addition
to
a
commonly
so
mediocre
style
mo
has
a
nice
smooth
creamy
easy
drinking
feel
and
overall
it
is
just
an
average
beer
that
looks
good
when
pouring
it
into
a
beer
mug
12
oz
bottle
randomly
had
at
a
bbq
i
actually
didnt
even
realize
this
had
wheat
in
the
mash
until
i
read
it
its
not
too
sharp
on
the
wheat
and
not
much
depth
in
the
rest
of
the
malt
yeast
character
is
nothing
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
in
fact
i
cant
say
i
really
dig
many
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewery
unlike
its
cousin
ipa
i
find
this
beer
to
be
slightly
less
than
average
not
to
say
its
bad
just
nothing
id
write
home
about
poured
o
k
looked
nice
with
a
nice
head
however
i
failed
to
detect
any
aromas
other
than
beer
the
taste
was
a
nice
smooth
clean
ale
flavor
albeit
no
strong
flavors
shown
through
ale
was
your
standard
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
too
overly
carbonated
overall
id
say
this
beer
is
a
choice
you
can
count
on
for
a
solid
beer
but
not
something
you
should
choose
over
others
if
there
are
better
options
slay
that
trout
sir
like
it
was
a
trout
i
have
been
pleased
with
other
big
sky
products
and
loved
the
name
and
label
of
this
beer
so
figured
i
would
give
it
a
shot
i
picked
it
up
for
the
old
lady
as
she
really
likes
lighter
wheat
ales
however
she
thought
it
was
a
generic
light
beer
the
flavor
really
didnt
come
through
on
this
one
if
youre
looking
for
a
solid
refreshing
beer
thats
not
big
on
flavor
this
is
for
you
if
youre
into
big
beer
flavor
pick
up
one
of
their
other
fine
brews
final
thought
love
this
beer
interesting
malt
backbone
biscuit
and
light
toffee
cover
up
alot
of
the
wheat
hops
are
there
just
a
bit
i
could
use
more
of
the
flavoring
variety
here
yeast
is
pretty
clean
but
does
throw
off
some
bready
flavors
the
can

would
be
happy
to
suck

a

of

murky
citrusy
are
the
most
stricking
aspects
of
this
session
friendly
brew
great
match
for
the
pulled
pork
sandwich
i
had
amazing
smooth
flavor
hint
of
citris
pours
to
a
nice
creamy
white
head
that
has
some
lacing
and
retention
color
is
hazy
orangeyellow
aroma
is
fruity
candylike
and
floral
with
some
wheaty
notes
as
well
flavor
suggests
a
hint
of
coriander
acacia
or
some
other
flavoring
added
says
on
the
label
ale
with
natural
flavor
added
and
the
soft
clean
crisp
taste
of
red
wheat
and
hops
barely
detectable
dry
spicy
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
correct
for
style
no
anomalies
overall
this
beer
hits
the
spot
for
summer
sessioning
not
a
very
tasty
summer
wheat
what
can
i
say
about
this
beer
hmmmm
it
is
a
good
wheat
the
interesting
thing
is
that
even
though
wheats
are
usually
light
this
beer
takes
it
a
step
further
and
to
me
is
extra
light
nice
color
good
head
and
a
mild
flavor
yes
it
has
the
wheat
taste
but
is
very
light
and
the
afterfeel
melts
way
quickly
aftertaste
is
gone
quickly
this
beer
is
refreshing
but
i
feel
like
i
would
like
just
a
touch
more
boldness
id
drink
this
on
the
beach
or
while
mowing
the
lawn
quite
refreshing
chilled
down
to
36
degrees
in
my
beer
cooler
and
used
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
with
a
very
small
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
at
all
but
leaves
some
lacing
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
grains
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
vanilla
very
nice
the
taste
is
of
sweet
wheat
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
caramel
reminds
me
a
little
of
the
paradise
beach
ale
that
is
only
served
at
cheeseburger
in
paradise
very
smooth
with
a
very
slight
dry
finish
on
the
end
overall
really
like
this
one
o
like
a
nude
beach
this
beer
keeps
it
simple
a
summer
beach
beer
to
its
core
nude
beach
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
showcases
wheat
wonderfully
and
balances
it
well
finishing
with
exceptional
smoothness
pours
a
hazy
orangish
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
the
smell
is
mostly
a
grainy
wheat
with
citrus
and
hints
of
hops
big
citrus
and
wheat
up
front
tasting
of
orange
and
lemon
the
citrus
sticks
throughout
the
rest
with
the
wheat
and
subtle
hops
in
the
aftertaste
this
beer
is
dominated
by
the
citrus
though
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
larger
feel
of
carbonation
it
could
be
a
little
more
crisp
to
add
to
the
flavor
but
still
a
very
refreshing
beer
has
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
but
isnt
overpowering
overall
a
nice
beer
with
good
flavor
o
a
tasty
wheat
ale
surprisingly
flavorful
easy
drinking
and
a
solid
patio
ale
o
great
beer
to
relax
on
a
hot
day
with
overall
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
it
has
the
look
the
taste
and
the
lightness
that
compliments
a
hot
summer
day
to
a
tee
found
this
beer
here
in
michigan
in
may
dont
recall
seeing
it
before
but
because
ive
had
other
point
beers
in
the
past
and
enjoyed
them
overall
especially
since
the
point
beers
are
not
expensive
nude
beach
has
been
my
go
to
beer
this
summer
it
reminds
me
of
german
weissbiers
and
is
very
drinkable
its
a
bit
cloudy
with
a
good
head
and
smells
very
fresh
not
bitter
with
a
nice
full
mouth
experience
cant
say
enough
good
about
this
beer
just
hope
they
keep
making
it
and
dont
change
a
thing
m
light
body
with
some
chew
moderate
carbonation
there
is
something
not
quite
right
here
this
brew
would
benefit
from
a
piece
of
fruit
in
it
enough
said
weak
malt
and
slightly
funky
wheat
begin
the
flavor
profile
this
is
complimented
by
the
taste
of
apples
that
have
just
gone
over
and
ought
to
be
thrown
out
and
some
light
hops
drinkability
it
turns
into
a
reasonable
and
worthwhile
purchase
but
there
are
many
other
and
better
wheats
to
enjoy
during
the
summer
o
on
a
hot
day
this
would
be
king
right
now
its
just
okay
overall
not
bad
for
the
style
nothing
groundbreaking
but
decent
thirst
quenching
summer
brew
o
this
is
a
great
craft
lawnmower
beer
because
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
from
a
can
stamped
0242
on
the
bottom
sampled
on
june
16
2012
the
pour
is
a
hazy
pale
to
golden
yellow
with
a
small
white
fizzy
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
is
pleasant
with
an
array
of
wheat
yeast
and
citrus
zest
on
the
nose
the
body
is
light
as
a
summer
ale
should
be
but
my
particular
can
had
a
slight
acidity
to
it
the
can
did
have
a
dent
but
it
was
the
last
one
left
when
i
bought
it
the
taste
ushers
in
a
soothing
wheat
flavor
along
with
a
zing
of
lemon
and
a
nicely
balanced
mellow
hop
finale
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
while
enjoying
the
coast
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
this
beer
is
quite
sessionable
and
definitely
enjoyable
might
be
one
to
get
again
for
the
summer
o
kind
of
bland
was
hoping
for
more
flavor
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
or
again
in
a
bottle
to
compare
overall
i
love
the
horizon
wheat
beer
they
make
so
i
thought
id
try
this
seasonal
one
i
like
it
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
unfiltered
pale
yellow
coloring
with
a
thin
white
light
head
atop
the
surface
aromas
of
toasted
bread
bananas
and
light
clove
spicing
highlighted
by
an
overall
roasting
fill
the
nose
flavors
are
slightly
muddled
with
a
creamy
texture
giving
rise
to
a
slightly
roasted
banana
bread
and
clove
blending
that
is
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
light
fruity
and
slightly
spiced
aftertaste
with
a
smooth
light
finish
the
beer
is
a
little
too
light
at
points
in
mouth
to
support
the
flavors
but
an
easy
enough
beer
to
drink
overall
good
warm
weather
brew
pours
out
a
yellow
hue
with
a
thin
white
head
that
leaves
little
retention
and
not
much
lacing
the
get
some
wheat
and
yeast
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
a
nice
bread
grain
and
wheat
with
a
yeast
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
dry
and
chalky
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
not
too
expensive
at
1
29
per
12
oz
bottle
drinkability
a
fine
thirst
quencher
this
summer
i
wouldnt
mind
grabbing
some
more
of
these
next
summer
a
bit
offseason
perhaps
but
not
by
very
much
and
i
just
had
to
try
this
beer
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
shortlived
finger
or
so
of
fizzy
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
lighter
grass
very
light
biscuit
and
light
acetone
the
taste
holds
notes
of
cracked
wheat
light
white
bread
sweetgrass
and
a
twinge
of
alcoholic
fruit
that
may
sound
vague
but
not
as
vague
as
it
tasted
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
tepid
beer
not
much
going
on
at
all
and
what
is
there
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
though
its
in
no
real
way
offensive
just
boring
in
a
shabby
kind
o
way
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
lightbodied
and
pretty
solid
for
a
summer
brew
it
feels
a
bit
out
of
place
drinking
it
in
october
but
i
of
course
did
not
dock
it
for
that
this
is
just
okay
but
i
would
never
purchase
it
again
o
pretty
good
summer
beer
could
easily
drink
a
sixer
of
these
on
a
hot
day
on
the
porch
ill
definitely
look
for
this
at
my
local
store
o
decent
wheat
ale
good
summer
beer
on
a
hot
day
i
could
still
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
as
the
flavor
isnt
bad
i
would
just
wish
for
a
little
more
out
of
it
still
thanks
for
the
beer
evan
hadnt
heard
or
seen
this
but
was
at
tap
house
in
hampton
and
bartender
let
me
try
it
since
it
was
being
heavily
promoted
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
w
good
head
on
top
of
a
grainy
yet
smell
of
hops
and
a
touch
of
yeast
wouldnt
have
thought
this
was
a
pale
wheat
as
it
seemed
more
to
me
as
a
crappy
fruit
beer
the
yeast
is
overpowered
by
just
bitter
hops
and
this
cloying
fruity
sweetness
that
i
couldnt
stomach
for
an
entire
glass
it
was
alright
to
try
but
not
my
pick
for
a
beer
overall
very
refreshing
a
good
session
beer
perfect
for
summer
afternoons
overall
would
be
an
alright
session
beer
or
to
accompany
a
meal
pours
a
completely
clouded
true
strawyellow
a
white
head
soon
rings
up
but
washes
the
glass
smells
like
a
bunch
of
mineral
but
also
some
bittersweetness
underneath
taste
just
sort
of
unfolds
into
an
oversweetness
that
i
can
only
describe
as
wortlike
feel
is
thick
and
oily
ends
sour
but
seriously
i
think
this
stuff
got
bottled
too
soon
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
really
good
for
1012
pack
definitely
will
buy
this
again
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
so
taste
leaves
quick
this
obviously
caught
my
eye
and
bought
a
6
pack
of
it
at
a
liquor
store
in
delaware
after
visiting
the
dogfish
head
brewpub
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
hazy
golden
color
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
fresh
and
lightly
citric
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
wheat
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
not
overly
carbonated
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
summer
time
i
liked
it
o
this
beer
says
that
summer
is
here
and
i
have
to
agree
nothing
outstanding
but
not
a
single
flaw
havent
had
anything
from
point
in
quite
a
while
and
now
im
eager
to
visit
a
few
of
their
other
offerings
again
good
stuff
enjoy
it
while
its
here
o
this
is
an
okay
american
wheat
ale
fairly
typical
for
point
brewery
the
mouthfeel
has
a
metallic
taste
to
it
the
odor
is
rather
weak
overall
very
average
i
wouldnt
buy
again
notes
bland
beer
but
somewhat
refreshing
for
a
cheap
summer
beer
simple
pale
wheat
beer
nothing
with
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
is
refreshing
for
the
price
and
the
fact
that
they
can
it
makes
it
a
nice
summer
beer
but
other
than
that
it
isnt
worth
the
trouble
d
i
like
it
okay
nothing
spectacular
going
in
but
its
not
too
sweet
like
most
summer
wheats
good
on
hot
day
of
digging
in
the
dirt
o
definitely
an
easy
drinker
you
could
definitely
throw
a
handful
or
more
back
without
any
problem
on
a
summer
day
o
not
mindblowing
but
certainly
can
hold
its
own
as
a
summer
beer
i
would
take
this
over
sam
summer
as
it
is
more
flavorful
and
slightly
lighter
the
lemon
and
citrus
flavors
pop
more
and
i
can
see
myself
out
on
a
summer
day
with
this
easily
overall
pretty
refreshing
and
nice
flavor
is
a
bit
muted
and
on
the
sweet
side
of
things
but
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
no
problem
pours
a
hazy
yellow
to
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
citrus
and
a
small
wheat
note
in
the
taste
a
sweet
light
citrus
and
a
small
pilsner
like
hop
a
saaz
pilsner
like
hop
bite
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
wheat
note
in
the
aftertaste
eh
somewhere
between
a
pilsner
and
a
wheat
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
decent
sized
head
on
the
cloudy
body
aroma
of
wheat
and
some
lemon
predominate
in
the
nose
follows
through
with
a
basic
wheatbananacitrus
interaction
and
also
a
little
grainy
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
bodied
alittle
thin
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
american
wheat
decent
beer
at
a
decent
price
at
9
99
for
a
twelve
pack
thats
only
about
a
buck
more
than
others
might
be
charging
for
a
six
pack
good
value
most
reviewers
seem
to
like
this
beer
so
maybe
my
particular
bottle
was
mishandled
or
is
over
the
hill
but
if
this
is
what
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
then
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
notes
this
is
a
very
solid
american
made
german
hefeweizen
all
in
all
its
a
great
quaffable
brew
as
far
as
summer
beers
go
i
think
this
is
on
the
mark
and
i
enjoyed
it
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
poundable
beer
because
its
so
light
but
there
are
several
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
average
brew
so
many
better
wheat
beers
out
there
but
point
does
a
fair
job
would
i
buy
more
of
it
i
really
dig
this
beer
its
very
easy
drinking
and
a
great
canned
alternative
to
other
light
summer
wheat
beers
a
la
sam
adams
summer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
12
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
good
mix
of
pale
and
wheat
malt
scents
along
with
a
crisp
dry
fruitiness
there
are
a
decent
amount
of
esters
present
the
banana
clove
aromas
are
mild
but
well
perceived
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
smooth
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
with
some
prickly
carbonation
in
the
finish
it
seems
a
bit
watery
and
lacking
in
yeast
character
also
its
a
bit
heavier
than
most
summer
beers
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
goodtoo
much
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
the
best
wheat
beer
on
the
market
the
ab
wheat
beers
are
better
for
a
summer
wheat
this
is
really
great
very
drinkable
the
body
was
light
but
not
lacking
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
crisp
chalky
finish
made
it
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
now
i
gotta
find
a
nude
beach
rjt
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
fizzy
white
head
excellent
retention
and
very
nice
laceing
aroma
is
of
wheat
and
citrus
nice
but
a
bit
weak
body
is
medium
with
some
carbonation
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
lemon
and
citrus
throughout
tangyspicy
finish
very
nice
d
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
this
is
better
than
many
of
its
competitors
including
312
blue
moon
shock
top
etc
not
a
world
class
beer
but
a
good
summer
lawnmower
beer
nonetheless
d
drinkability
was
good
though
not
necessarily
exciting
it
does
what
a
basic
example
is
asked
for
and
easily
goes
down
with
little
effort
as
long
as
youre
not
overly
critical
could
be
a
nice
thirst
quencher
and
downer
and
a
safe
play
for
mixed
crowds
for
that
summer
party
perhaps
on
the
beach
perhaps
clothes
optional
i
wouldnt
of
been
disappointed
with
a
six
pack
purchase
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
quarter
inch
cap
of
white
foam
the
aroma
is
lemon
zest
tangy
wheat
and
a
hint
of
clove
it
is
a
lot
more
aromatic
than
more
american
style
wheat
beers
and
i
like
that
the
taste
is
just
as
strong
as
the
aroma
there
is
lots
of
lemon
lots
of
wheat
and
again
a
hint
of
clove
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
fairly
high
carbonation
which
is
alright
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
surprise
from
stevens
point
brewery
nice
to
see
a
good
micro
come
out
of
wisconsin
i
was
unsure
whether
or
not
i
should
pour
th
sediment
into
the
glass
i
figured
it
looks
like
a
hefe
i
might
as
well
go
for
some
extra
b
vitamins
a
nice
cloudy
golden
orange
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
lacing
forms
nicely
in
fine
even
layers
aromatics
bring
out
some
nice
citric
an
sharp
wheat
qualities
if
you
dont
like
wheat
beers
pass
on
this
however
from
all
of
the
stevens
point
brews
ive
tried
thus
far
this
is
my
favorite
most
drinkabe
offering
ive
come
across
orange
peel
no
spice
additions
tangy
sharp
wheat
profile
creamy
edges
slightly
acidic
nature
this
is
a
nice
little
summer
sipper
nothing
too
offensive
especialy
compared
to
most
of
these
summer
american
pale
wheats
no
off
flavors
a
nice
light
bodied
evenly
carbonated
smooth
experience
on
the
palate
drinkability
isnt
bad
at
all
i
wish
i
would
have
tracked
down
some
cans
of
this
offering
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
perfect
session
beer
light
with
great
flavor
id
recommend
it
my
aggressive
pour
on
this
hot
evening
gave
me
two
fingers
worth
of
orangishyellow
head
that
popped
and
fizzled
like
a
jalopy
that
was
about
to
run
out
of
gas
the
color
was
a
cloudy
orangishamber
like
freshsqueezed
grapefruit
juice
the
nose
was
soft
and
gently
fruity
slightly
citrus
like
tangerines
or
oranges
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
mild
bananatangerine
sweetness
on
the
tongue
it
was
more
fruity
than
i
have
come
to
expect
from
the
style
but
it
was
still
pleasant
because
the
banana
esters
did
not
dominate
finish
was
tangy
slightly
citrusy
approaching
dry
not
bad
and
certainly
worthy
of
being
in
the
cooler
that
also
appears
on
the
can
d
a
nicely
done
american
wheat
from
point
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
and
it
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
crossover
for
non
craft
drinkers
pretty
good
bang
for
your
buck
too
drinkability
is
quite
good
the
fact
that
its
not
too
pronounced
makes
it
easy
to
drink
many
in
a
roll
a
good
pick
for
a
session
beer
at
the
8
99
i
paid
for
the
12pk
of
cans
orange
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
very
light
aroma
has
a
citrusy
zest
to
it
taste
is
orangewheat
grains
and
a
hint
of
lemon
overall
kind
of
an
average
beer
that
really
doesnt
have
much
to
get
excited
about
i
does
seem
like
it
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
im
5050
on
whether
i
would
recommend
this
as
for
me
i
would
only
drink
again
if
it
was
free
limited
carbonation
east
drinking
good
summer
beer
unremarkable
though
overall
its
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
its
wellbrewed
and
its
fairly
flavorful
it
would
make
a
great
introduction
for
someone
whos
never
had
a
wheat
aficionados
will
probably
find
it
fairly
mainstream
but
it
certainly
has
a
time
and
place
summer
bbqs
baseball
games
the
beach
boating
etc
not
bad
drinkability
if
you
like
lemony
flavored
beers
but
dont
like
alchopops
skip
the
leines
summer
shandy
and
try
this
its
no
world
beater
but
its
refreshing
and
tastes
like
a
wheat
beer
nude
beach
summer
wheat
is
exhibit
a
in
proving
that
success
in
this
business
is
often
as
much
about
marketing
as
it
is
about
the
product
itself
maybe
the
beers
blandness
and
its
easy
drinkability
appeals
to
a
whole
lotta
wisconsonites
more
power
to
em
but
ill
stick
to
apwas
that
are
stylishly
dressed
this
drinks
easily
and
goes
well
with
summer
sun
and
heat
while
not
a
standout
its
more
than
nonoffensive
in
its
pleasures
good
way
to
introduce
someone
to
wheat
beers
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
there
is
suspended
yeast
sediment
throughout
the
glass
54
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
coriander
wheat
yeast
hops
and
clove
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
coriander
yeast
wheat
and
slight
sweet
malt
overall
a
decent
wheat
beer
that
is
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
taste
the
taste
is
less
flavorful
then
some
wheats
but
it
is
very
refreshing
with
with
a
slight
citrus
flavor
all
and
all
a
little
more
bland
then
i
would
expect
but
other
then
that
not
too
bad
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
an
inch
and
a
half
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
quarter
inch
cap
of
white
foam
the
aroma
is
lemon
zest
tangy
wheat
and
a
hint
of
clove
it
is
a
lot
more
aromatic
than
more
american
style
wheat
beers
and
i
like
that
the
taste
is
just
as
strong
as
the
aroma
there
is
lots
of
lemon
lots
of
wheat
and
again
a
hint
of
clove
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
with
fairly
high
carbonation
which
is
alright
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
surprise
from
stevens
point
brewery
in
a
style
that
is
almost
always
dumbed
down
it
is
nice
to
see
a
brewery
that
almost
always
dumbs
down
its
beer
actually
craft
something
interesting
overall
it
is
an
okay
beer
nothing
special
about
it
it
is
good
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
im
impressed
by
this
apwa
from
point
good
where
many
american
versions
lack
and
cheap
in
price
too
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
semihazy
gold
with
a
nice
one
inch
head
that
settles
to
film
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
tame
some
decent
wheat
malt
some
lemon
maybe
some
clove
not
much
else
the
taste
get
a
bit
funky
but
still
pretty
good
some
wheat
malt
some
citrus
some
clove
maybe
a
funky
bit
of
yeast
is
what
i
was
getting
at
first
the
mouth
is
decent
body
isnt
half
bad
carbonation
is
decent
drying
a
bit
at
end
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
but
rubs
me
wrong
for
whatever
reason
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
a
mix
between
crispness
and
creaminess
pretty
much
spot
on
for
the
style
overall
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
good
deal
of
this
and
would
go
well
on
a
hot
day
on
a
nude
beach
although
they
need
to
can
this
brew
as
you
cant
bring
bottles
on
the
nude
beach
this
is
a
really
light
offering
pretty
wimpy
beer
with
very
little
character
whatsoever
no
off
tastes
but
very
little
to
get
excited
about
here
i
guess
it
would
be
okay
out
in
the
boat
on
a
hot
day
but
it
was
pretty
unsatisfying
compared
to
a
312
or
a
spotted
cow
it
is
just
lame
wimpy
wimpy
wimpy
a
very
drinkable
very
satisfying
summer
brew
point
did
a
nice
job
with
this
beer
for
the
lazy
days
of
summer
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
medium
foamy
head
on
a
cloudy
yellow
body
smell
of
a
typical
wheat
nice
touch
of
corn
and
some
sweetness
as
well
the
wheat
wasnt
as
strong
in
the
taste
but
the
sweetness
was
very
smooth
yet
thick
like
a
good
wheat
should
be
good
stuff
not
among
the
greats
but
definitely
drinkable
more
or
less
the
same
as
points
horizon
wheat
only
a
tad
sweeter
the
mouth
is
pleasantly
carbonated
with
a
bit
of
tartness
very
refreshing
in
the
summer
well
done
md
perfect
great
carbonation
extremly
refreshing
clean
tasty
what
more
can
you
ask
i
tried
it
very
cold
about
35
deg
and
again
at
about
4550
deg
both
times
it
worked
obviously
the
warmer
temp
opened
up
the
flavors
a
bit
but
i
preferred
it
cold
it
works
great
cheers
to
the
guys
at
point
the
maibock
nude
beach
and
horizon
have
been
very
good
nice
beer
i
think
its
label
spelled
it
all
out
summer
wheat
thats
the
look
slight
sunny
color
smell
slightly
citricy
but
wheatie
no
pun
intended
the
head
caved
slightly
fast
but
hey
couldve
been
minute
residue
in
the
glass
from
beforehand
i
liked
it
maybe
a
few
of
em
with
a
group
of
friends
and
we
might
just
start
dancing
in
the
moonlight
just
okay
for
me
not
bad
but
nothing
special
this
beer
is
an
okay
one
very
drinkable
tasty
beer
great
ok
for
a
light
beer
prefer
dark
there
wasnt
an
ounce
of
flavor
in
this
and
this
style
is
my
sweet
spot
not
a
bad
beer
a
summer
classic
circus
boy
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
very
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
mostly
wheat
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
on
the
nose
i
found
the
taste
to
be
the
exact
opposite
with
a
lot
of
lemon
grass
and
orange
flavors
while
not
that
much
wheat
it
was
a
little
thin
but
for
the
summer
i
was
pretty
content
with
one
overall
it
didnt
blow
me
away
or
anything
but
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
either
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
crisp
with
a
really
light
drinkable
feel
this
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
low
in
abv
and
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
overall
i
liked
this
at
the
beginning
but
the
longer
i
sipped
on
it
the
more
harsh
it
became
overall
this
is
a
twist
on
the
american
wheat
style
that
leans
heavily
on
the
lemon
quenching
aspects
i
picked
this
up
on
clearance
for
a
really
low
price
and
had
it
been
summer
i
would
have
bought
multiple
cases
magic
hat

3
5
out
of
5
good
overall
pretty
good
i
would
drink
this
one
again
o
boooring
the
simple
fact
that
its
just
really
dull
instantly
makes
it
better
than
the
abomination
that
was
seance
at
least
in
a
way
i
hate
these
boring
beers
simply
because
they
create
dull
reviews
just
like
this
one
overall
one
of
magic
hats
best
light
beer
with
a
hint
of
wheat
and
citrus
almost
like
lemonade
i
would
purchase
again
overall
not
a
flavor
powerhouse
but
rather
easy
drinking
a
decent
brew
overall
ive
never
really
had
a
bad
wheat
beer
but
not
really
many
that
are
great
either
this
beer
is
a
little
light
and
the
wheat
flavor
is
subtle
there
is
also
a
bit
of
tange
ib
there
definitely
drinkable
and
as
impressive
as
most
other
beers
of
its
kind
but
not
more
so
this
is
a
somewhat
unique
hefeweizen
that
has
a
low
abv
which
lets
you
get
at
it
all
afternoon
without
having
to
slow
down
theres
an
interesting
smokymalt
flavor
that
im
noted
to
getting
up
of
similar
beers
that
doesnt
sound
good
but
surprisingly
was
bit
of
citrus
as
well
as
you
mit
expect
not
my
favorite
but
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
its
not
a
bad
idea
picked
up
a
few
circus
boys
because
i
feel
like
even
though
its
not
great
relative
to
other
brews
its
a
must
have
at
least
once
on
a
warm
summer
day
nice
medium
carbonation
with
low
abv
you
can
drink
a
6
pack
with
ease
and
it
goes
down
smooth
limited
twang
or
hops
to
it
and
mostly
a
light
biscuit
flavor
with
sour
lemon
lingering
in
the
front
and
back
of
the
mouth
o
pretty
good
beer
that
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
a
can
drinkable
but
not
huge
on
flavor
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
circus
boy
brew
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
spring
day
very
drinkable
overall
probably
my
least
favorite
beer
from
the
magic
hat
brewery
but
in
all
fairness
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
american
style
wheat
beers
in
general
give
me
a
german
style
any
day
o
overall
i
cant
say
it
was
a
bad
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
great
one
either
i
expected
more
from
the
beer
as
magic
hat
usually
has
a
great
product
o
i
cant
say
that
its
not
worth
a
try
but
there
are
better
american
wheats
out
there
i
normally
enjoy
what
magic
hat
has
to
offer
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
o
not
bad
at
all
the
addition
of
lemongrass
gave
this
some
nice
tartness
this
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
beer
is
hazy
and
yellow
as
is
typical
of
the
style
small
white
head
that
leaves
a
thick
trail
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
offers
lemons
malt
cleaning
solution
more
cleaning
solution
and
artificial
lemon
in
the
flavor
lacking
body
character
tastes
gimmicky
cheap
just
not
my
thing
i
would
never
choose
this
over
any
german
hefe
not
a
repeat
a
hint
of
pepper
appears
on
taste
carbonation
up
front
and
a
watery
back
end
the
foul
scent
is
confirmed
a
cask
strength
scotch
is
necessary
for
proper
cleansing
if
this
were
the
only
example
i
had
for
the
style
id
be
bummed
overall
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
brew
for
what
its
supposed
to
be
it
has
a
decent
taste
but
its
almost
too
easy
of
a
drink
if
you
know
what
i
mean
circus
boy
pours
a
mostly
hazy
tangerine
with
a
decent
amount
of
goldenrod
highlights
only
half
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
tops
the
beer
and
both
head
retention
and
lacing
are
basically
nonexistent
the
nose
is
entirely
too
weak
theres
a
bit
of
grainy
wheat
and
a
trace
of
lemon
but
thats
it
the
flavor
profile
is
better
but
just
barely
the
same
wheatiness
greets
me
first
with
each
sip
but
here
its
followed
by
a
light
sprinkling
of
black
pepper
a
muted
lemon
zest
note
provides
the
finish
the
body
is
a
little
full
and
the
carbonation
a
little
lackluster
but
still
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
this
beers
best
quality
circus
boy
tastes
like
its
a
bit
past
its
prime
not
that
theres
any
bottle
dating
present
but
i
dont
think
even
in
peak
condition
its
much
more
than
an
alright
wheat
beer
and
for
the
love
of
god
dont
call
it
a
hefeweizen
i
feel
dirty
drinking
out
of
this
glass
but
its
what
they
have
here
so
cest
la
vie
indeed
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
corn
syrup
and
very
light
lettuce
theres
a
palpable
sweetness
pervading
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
funky
wheat
old
lemon
peel
and
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
surprisingly
very
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
sad
hefe
the
yeast
character
is
nil
the
wheat
is
funky
and
things
just
seemed
generally
off
conclusion
not
a
bad
beer
but
really
not
special
either
there
isnt
much
to
set
this
apart
from
other
apwas
but
the
malt
flavors
are
clean
and
textured
i
suppose
this
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
lemon
wedge
i
would
never
turn
this
down
and
if
there
were
not
so
many
fantastic
local
alternatives
i
cant
find
any
reason
why
i
wouldnt
want
some
stocked
in
my
fridge
especially
during
the
summer
months
o
would
make
a
much
better
summer
beer
not
my
favorite
beer
in
the
genre
but
still
a
nice
pour
draft
16
to
24oz
pours
growlers
magic
hat
is
pretty
successful
by
the
standards
of
an
economically
oriented
world
and
while
they
provide
a
decent
variety
of
styles
and
a
couple
of
outstanding
offerings
i
dont
know
they
deserve
all
the
attention
thats
come
their
way
not
when
there
are
so
many
better
microbreweries
still
wrestling
for
a
share
of
the
pie
consider
looking
elsewhere
if
you
like
this
style
try
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
by
lags
the
standard
imnsho
and
truly
outstanding
o
decent
hefeweizen
could
be
more
complex
tastewise
o
this
is
a
nice
wheat
beer
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
light
body
with
fairly
crisp
carbonation
decent
crispness
still
fails
to
clean
up
as
much
as
it
could
watery
not
outstanding
or
particularly
tasty
in
any
way
and
not
something
id
return
to
in
the
future
m
thin
body
good
carbonation
finish
is
fairly
clean
overall
a
pretty
basic
hefeweizen
with
a
nice
taste
a
refreshing
feel
and
a
great
drinkability
this
is
a
brew
that
is
light
in
alcohol
and
refreshing
in
taste
making
it
a
great
addition
to
any
summer
outing
very
mild
pale
wheat
that
isnt
too
bad
now
when
magic
hat
calls
it
a
hefeweizen
thats
when
we
have
a
problem
not
much
to
this
beer
it
would
be
good
for
beginners
and
beer
pong
and
thats
about
it
i
would
guess
o
enjoyed
this
beer
really
one
of
magic
hats
better
offerings
give
this
one
a
shot
12
oz
bottle
from
traders
joe
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
short
lived
white
head
nose
is
citrus
fruit
and
some
grassy
hops
body
is
medium
and
slightly
crisp
sweet
wheat
malt
citrus
fruits
hints
of
spices
and
banana
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
long
and
pleasantly
dry
it
is
not
german
hefe
but
still
pleasant
easy
drinking
brew
overall
this
is
a
pretty
damned
good
offering
from
the
boys
and
girls
from
magic
hat
i
would
definitly
drink
more
of
it
o
not
a
bad
beer
i
guess
i
found
it
interesting
with
the
black
pepper
thing
going
on
in
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
it
may
be
something
i
just
need
to
get
used
to
thats
all
im
not
sure
if
i
would
get
this
again
maybe
on
tap
really
good
stuff
would
make
a
great
summer
session
beer
light
bodied
plenty
of
carbonation
thin
and
watery
im
not
sure
if
this
has
been
sitting
for
a
while
or
just
placed
on
the
shelf
but
i
am
glad
i
only
tried
a
single
i
will
pass
on
this
in
the
future
disappointed
in
this
bottle
and
wont
be
trying
it
againat
least
until
i
get
a
chance
for
a
draft
in
vermont
to
figure
out
the
difference
after
finishing
my
review
i
saw
the
alstrom
review
has
being
much
higher
that
review
is
from
2006
so
maybe
something
has
changed
in
the
beer
since
then
in
spite
of
the
name
being
the
same
but
iin
reading
jason
as
review
i
am
not
drinking
the
same
quality
of
beer
whether
its
transportation
lack
of
magic
hat
sales
in
minnesota
timing
of
when
i
bought
it
etc
im
not
sure
just
doesnt
live
up
pour
is
yellow
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
slight
foam
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
no
lacing
smells
of
crackers
biscuit
malt
wheat
taste
is
wheat
and
corn
malt
yeast
a
tad
sour
with
a
bit
of
brightness
from
the
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
but
holds
together
adequately
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
nor
would
i
seek
it
out
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
had
my
doubts
because
m
h
can
be
soso
at
times
i
was
surprised
at
the
outcome
o
this
is
ok
would
probably
benefit
from
the
addition
of
a
lemon
overall
not
too
good
a
little
sweet
and
much
too
tart
the
carbonation
didnt
help
advertised
as
a
hefe
this
i
think
is
mych
more
of
an
american
wheat
beer
hybrid
style
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
visible
yeast
bits
and
a
nice
lacy
head
smells
fruity
and
malty
mildly
spicy
aroma
taste
is
very
refreshing
noticable
lemon
or
lemongrass
element
and
a
nice
yeast
flavor
very
well
carbonated
and
lighter
bodied
makes
it
a
crusher
in
the
summer
but
this
beer
is
good
any
time
of
year
one
of
magic
hats
most
popular
beers
overall
i
can
think
of
many
better
offering
but
this
one
is
a
pretty
good
domestic
hefeweizen
you
really
have
to
get
it
fresh
or
take
special
note
of
the
best
by
date
because
after
a
few
months
these
flavors
tend
to
age
out
had
an
old
bottle
once
and
it
was
yeasty
and
bland
ok
beer
overall
overall
though
the
hefeweizen
is
a
really
good
wheat
beer
a
few
of
my
buddies
tried
it
for
the
first
time
when
the
swung
by
last
weekend
and
they
loved
it
this
may
be
my
favorite
of
that
magic
hat
line
as
of
this
writing
tried
this
beer
again
after
a
long
hiatus
i
wish
i
enjoyed
it
more
but
just
find
it
so
bland
it
is
an
easy
sipper
that
can
be
sessioned
but
i
just
cant
find
enough
interesting
character
to
warrent
frequent
returns
wish
there
was
some
spice
or
sweet
or
more
pronounced
wheat
or
yeast
character
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
expected
magic
hat
departs
from
typical
bavarianstyle
hefe
but
in
a
good
way
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
a
bit
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
as
the
taste
in
general
is
rather
subdued
but
it
is
a
crisp
refreshing
and
sessionable
brew
im
not
sure
why
its
categorized
in
the
apwa
category
as
there
is
almost
no
hop
flavor
to
it
ive
had
better
hefeweizens
but
this
particular
one
is
not
bad
as
a
tastier
party
beer
or
a
lawnmower
beer
overall
id
give
it
a
2
5
because
i
was
disgusted
by
the
chunks
of
junk
floating
around
in
it
o
not
bad
but
not
great
a
middle
of
the
road
wheat
beer
in
everysense
drinkable
but
doesnt
stand
out
at
all
poured
a
1
5
white
head
which
vanished
quickly
reminiscent
of
some
cheap
brews
hazy
naples
yellow
body
color
smell
is
very
mild
and
most
i
can
pick
out
of
it
is
citrus
zest
taste
is
pretty
bmc
actually
enough
so
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
might
not
even
guess
it
was
a
hef
theres
not
much
length
to
the
finish
and
it
leaves
a
slight
aftertaste
of
malt
o
another
pedestrian
wheat
beer
that
im
sure
sells
good
but
is
not
inspiring
at
all
this
is
in
my
opinion
all
around
weak
its
sessionable
but
its
rather
one
dimensional
o
this
is
a
decent
hefe
but
a
horrible
apwa
i
wouldnt
mind
a
few
of
these
during
a
summer
bbq
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
hoppy
pale
ale
youre
going
to
be
disappointed
i
have
a
friend
who
loves
magic
hat
beers
but
hates
this
one
i
still
struggle
to
see
how
that
can
be
for
me
circus
boy
is
a
top
choice
when
it
comes
to
magic
hat
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
back
in
march
2008
and
i
really
enjoy
it
ever
since
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
hazy
yellow
color
much
like
a
hefeweizen
should
look
the
head
was
fluffy
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
clove
banana
and
wheat
aroma
coming
off
of
it
the
taste
has
the
banana
and
wheat
flavors
through
out
the
beer
i
never
tried
this
with
an
orange
wedge
but
im
sure
thats
pretty
good
too
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
feeling
very
drinkable
summer
brew
overall
i
really
enjoy
it
i
like
having
it
on
hot
days
or
anytime
for
that
matter
overall
it
is
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
but
not
on
my
top
5
heffe
list
thats
for
sure
give
it
a
try
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
spice
this
become
somewhat
apparent
in
the
nose
only
to
blossom
forth
in
the
flavor
and
surprisingly
even
more
so
in
the
aftertaste
where
we
lost
huge
points
was
in
the
mouthfeel
which
was
watery
and
rather
undesirable
overall
a
nice
smooth
sessionable
wheat
ale
i
do
like
the
taste
of
honey
in
this
i
will
look
for
this
again
overall
i
was
surprised
at
how
good
this
beer
was
a
perfect
example
of
a
good
american
wheat
beer
overall
drinkability
this
is
a
good
light
summer
beer
that
has
some
flavor
to
it
without
any
hop
bitterness
says
heffeweisen
on
bottle
but
the
classification
on
here
is
american
pale
wheat
ale
so
enjoy
it
for
whatever
its
supposed
to
be
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
hefe
would
i
drink
it
if
offered
absolutely
but
if
i
was
buying
id
look
for
a
better
option
before
settling
with
this
beer
dont
let
that
drive
you
away
though
if
you
didnt
know
what
lemongrass
was
and
didnt
know
it
was
in
the
beer
youd
never
suspect
anything
instead
you
would
assume
that
you
were
just
drinking
a
particularly
nice
light
crisp
summer
beer
because
this
is
a
good
beer
and
wellworth
trying
o
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
a
little
too
grainy
for
me
to
get
this
again
unless
it
was
a
95
degree
day
and
the
only
refreshing
option
but
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
overall
drinkability
good
summer
beer
i
dig
it
the
beer
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
with
some
grain
notes
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
pepper
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
lemons
oranges
and
wheat
with
some
pepper
notes
easy
to
drink
and
actually
quite
enjoyable
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
one
of
the
better
magic
hat
beers
o
not
to
bad
ive
had
some
real
ho
hum
american
hefes
and
this
isnt
one
of
them
has
to
do
with
the
hop
surprise
at
the
back
end
that
makes
this
one
worth
going
to
again
when
i
need
a
nice
refreshing
summer
brew
d
hefeweiss
this
is
not
but
a
lowlevel
wheat
beer
i
would
not
seek
this
out
it
is
so
disappointing
that
the
brewery
itself
is
calling
this
the
hefeweizen
o
solid
beer
overall
as
far
from
a
winter
warmer
as
you
can
get
but
would
be
absolutely
amazing
on
a
beach
better
than
a
couple
other
summery
hefs
ive
had
recently
would
buy
again
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
pale
hazy
flat
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
thin
white
loose
bubbled
head
that
is
steady
at
an
eighth
of
an
inch
while
you
drink
aromas
are
a
jumble
of
fruit
sweetness
all
of
which
are
fairly
watered
down
smells
include
lemon
zest
banana
pineapple
pear
and
a
little
bit
of
spicing
maybe
coriander
maybe
grains
of
paradise
interesting
flavors
are
watered
down
also
and
the
body
is
limp
and
lackluster
with
blend
of
bready
characteristics
lemon
zest
pear
some
weak
spicing
the
aftertaste
is
like
drinking
the
juice
from
a
fruit
salad
quick
semisweet
finish
watery
and
weak
the
beer
is
extremely
light
and
great
on
a
hot
day
not
huge
on
flavor
though
this
one
seems
to
have
a
pretty
decent
hop
schedule
as
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
to
compliment
the
wheat
tang
soft
lemony
citrus
flavors
up
front
are
followed
by
one
of
the
stronger
wheat
backbones
finish
is
pretty
dry
and
bitter
it
is
pretty
interesting
to
try
a
bit
different
than
your
typical
wheat
beer
i
dont
think
i
will
be
running
out
to
grab
a
sixer
anytime
soon
but
i
enjoyed
my
single
well
enough
gently
roused
this
pours
an
entirely
hazed
lite
strawyellow
with
a
ton
of
head
this
settles
down
to
a
sticky
ring
nose
is
mineral
and
a
lot
of
a
specific
potpourrilike
spice
that
i
cant
quite
place
taste
is
a
sour
affair
for
a
wheat
ale
lemongrass
and
the
aforementioned
mystery
spice
round
out
the
flavor
finishes
deep
with
some
pleasant
hops
mellows
out
a
bit
too
outoftheordinary
brew
but
nothing
spectacular
sampled
on
july
15
2011
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
a
magic
hat
beer
of
any
kind
since
the
buyout
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
has
a
fairly
good
wheat
quality
with
malt
spices
and
especially
pepper
the
body
is
okay
and
about
medium
the
taste
also
has
a
weak
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
a
citrus
zing
o
fine
example
of
his
ilk
at
least
as
refreshing
as
any
other
weizenheimer
this
is
a
show
you
could
watch
all
day
this
is
my
favorite
hefeweizen
it
is
so
refreshing
and
delicious
perfect
for
summer
o
i
like
wheat
beers
but
this
one
was
average
for
me
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
golden
yellow
body
with
a
2
inch
white
head
that
lays
down
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
is
of
wheat
and
lemon
the
taste
is
citrus
mostly
lemon
with
some
wheat
coming
through
the
mouth
feel
is
great
easy
drinker
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
drinkability
its
not
bad
but
its
far
from
the
best
hefes
ive
had
and
i
drink
them
often
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
magic
hat
brewing
with
this
one
they
should
really
change
the
label
from
hefeweizen
to
pale
wheat
ale
pours
a
hazy
yellow
head
does
not
last
scent
is
of
wheat
and
wheat
not
overpowering
taste
is
solid
wheat
comes
through
just
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
but
tart
as
well
a
refreshing
summer
lawnmower
beer
mouthfeel
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
in
this
brew
overall
a
solid
beer
4
0
i
poured
the
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
glass
to
find
a
golden
color
body
that
was
clear
with
a
bit
haziness
the
aroma
was
mild
with
a
hint
of
bread
and
grass
the
taste
was
much
better
than
the
aroma
the
flavors
are
more
pronounced
than
the
taste
you
get
the
taste
of
bread
bananas
and
citrus
i
enjoy
the
taste
but
doesnt
pack
the
same
punch
that
most
wheat
ales
do
the
beer
is
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
the
carbination
dances
a
bit
on
the
pallet
but
it
is
still
very
enjoyable
overall
its
a
good
beer
that
i
really
enjoy
drinking
in
the
summer
d
great
hefeweizen
clean
and
refreshing
great
summerspring
time
brew
to
be
enjoyed
within
the
company
of
friends
who
like
something
light
but
not
a
macro
o
not
really
my
prefered
style
of
beer
at
all
but
i
was
throwing
together
a
mix
of
brews
for
some
recreational
events
over
memorial
day
weekend
and
i
enjoy
this
beer
more
than
i
had
anticipate
a
solid
offering
o
this
beer
was
somewhat
lackluster
at
best
i
think
this
beer
through
the
years
has
changed
a
lot
and
not
for
the
better
although
my
palate
could
have
been
changed
as
well
i
dont
think
it
has
to
the
point
of
how
this
beer
tastes
now
not
a
bad
offering
but
a
little
bit
average
at
best
light
flavors
means
i
can
drink
this
without
thinking
about
it
downside
is
it
is
a
little
watery
this
is
up
there
as
one
of
my
favorite
hefe
not
being
a
fan
of
them
in
general
i
still
think
domestically
it
doesnt
get
much
better
this
is
a
very
citrus
infused
beer
with
some
good
coriander
notes
to
back
the
body
not
being
a
fan
of
those
on
a
regular
basis
i
am
impressed
how
much
i
enjoy
this
beer
every
time
i
have
it
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
felt
that
the
flavor
didnt
have
the
depth
i
was
looking
for
hefeweizens
and
wheat
beers
are
some
of
my
favorite
and
while
this
was
enjoyable
the
lemon
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
but
i
would
recommend
others
to
at
least
try
it
wheat
beers
are
not
my
thing
that
being
said
i
would
have
a
few
of
these
if
they
were
offered
to
me
i
think
this
beer
has
a
place
in
any
season
now
matter
what
i
am
a
fan
of
unfiltered
wheat
ales
i
like
to
shake
up
that
last
little
bit
and
get
some
nice
taste
out
of
the
left
over
yeast
magic
hat
has
pleased
me
with
their
line
of
beers
circus
boy
poured
a
very
cloudy
lemonade
color
with
a
healthy
head
the
smell
was
like
a
traditional
german
hefe
with
the
clove
yeast
and
ripe
banana
notes
the
taste
was
more
citrusy
with
some
lemon
peel
and
almost
candied
lemon
zest
in
the
background
goes
down
smooth
with
a
little
bite
in
the
end
the
mixed
up

a
hot
summer
day
would
make
a
nice
entrylevel
craft
brew
pours
pretty
clear
for
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
bright
golden
color
with
a
tiny
layer
of
bubbles
for
a
head
light
and
grassy
aroma
that
follows
through
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
mild
sweet
citrus
goes
down
easy
without
the
acidic
bite
characteristic
of
many
other
wheat
beers
thin
but
fairly
drinkable
had
this
beer
last
night
and
was
not
over
impressed
the
color
was
cloudy
unfiltered
yellow
with
floaties
i
hate
floaties
the
aroma
was
decent
certainly
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
was
decent
as
well
hints
of
clovespice
and
the
taste
coming
from
the
spice
was
almost
peppery
mouthfeel
was
ok
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
it
was
ok
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
value
the
taste
isnt
awesome
but
the
smell
is
quite
good
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
enough
nothing
special
a
slightly
heavier
than
light
body
and
some
heavy
carbonation
the
drinkability
of
course
is
superb
a
very
good
pale
wheat
ale
that
i
recommend
medium
bodied
though
leaning
heavier
medium
effervescence
smooth
aftertaste
spice
and
malt
linger
forever
nice
stuff
overall
blah
blah
blah
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
ever
i
expected
something
a
little
fruity
from
the
smell
but
was
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
complexity
i
feel
that
with
a
name
like
circus
boy
this
beer
should
have
put
a
little
more
of
a
show
complete
with
fire
and
acrobatics
in
my
mouth
no
dice
d
honestly
it
isnt
all
that
bad
for
what
it
is
there
is
just
a
touch
of
real
weizen
yeast
character
as
a
nod
to
the
beers
distant
origins
and
the
wheat
and
malt
are
well
balanced
with
the
light
hop
character
there
is
nothing
the
least
bit
interesting
going
on
here
but
it
isnt
at
all
offensive
either
and
it
is
really
pretty
drinkable
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
most
of
the
other
beer
that
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
o
i
do
like
this
beer
and
not
really
because
it
is
good
but
rather
because
it
is
quite
gingery
now
if
youll
excuse
me
im
going
to
take
my
throne
because
im
a
shooin
for
hateroftheyear
o
its
quite
good
i
usually
dont
like
american
wheats
but
this
one
leans
enough
toward
a
hefe
to
give
it
some
depth
of
flavor
o
overall
just
kind
of
underwhelming
b
3
73
o
well
if
you
dont
let
the
smell
of
this
scare
you
away
its
actually
an
ok
hefeweizen
nowhere
near
the
top
but
its
good
much
better
than
the
standard
magic
hat
9
not
worth
seeking
out
but
if
this
is
your
only
option
go
with
it
circus
boy
pours
a
murky
golden
yellow
with
pretty
darn
poor
head
retention
the
color
is
lovely
however
the
aroma
is
muted
but
contains
a
few
whiffs
of
lemon
scent
and
maybe
a
bit
of
spice
sadly
these
are
the
best
parts
of
this
ale
the
flavor
is
pretty
tame
for
a
hefe
grainy
a
bit
of
lemongrass
flavor
peaks
through
i
get
some
hits
of
fruity
flavor
from
the
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
if
it
is
hot
and
youre
at
your
buddies
house
and
he
has
some
cold
circus
boy
sure
grab
it
just
dont
seak
it
out
granted
i
would
have
no
problem
if
someone
offered
me
one
in
the
future
it
wasnt
that
bad
of
an
experience
it
tasted
nice
with
everything
that
should
be
present
in
a
hefe
but
i
just
couldnt
get
by
the
sharp
carbonation
magic
hat
circus
boy
is
a
cloudy
lively
pale
golden
ale
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
leave
a
small
ring
that
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
an
aroma
of
clove
and
pear
it
smells
grainy
and
fruity
the
smooth
foamy
light
body
has
a
clean
crisp
finish
its
lightly
flavored
and
well
balanced
clove
is
the
dominant
flavor
herbal
bitterness
finishes
the
taste
up
it
has
qualities
both
of
a
hefeweisen
and
an
american
wheat
ale
its
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
enjoyed
circus
boy
ive
had
it
several
times
in
the
past
and
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
wheat
ales
i
kept
that
in
mind
and
my
ratings
are
based
on
not
only
my
prior
beer
experiences
but
specifically
my
times
with
wheat
beers
not
hot
outside
enough
yet
delicious
and
very
drinkable
fantastic
session
candidate
will
look
for
this
again
heavy
sting
from
carbonation
up
front
giving
way
to
lemon
and
honey
notes
although
there
is
very
little
sweetness
there
is
some
bitter
citrus
almost
hidden
in
the
heavy
carbonation
finishes
with
a
grainy
wheat
taste
an
excellent
light
refreshing
brew
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
can
see
the
merits
to
this
specific
brew
it
is
however
a
pretty
decent
apwa
dn
this
is
the
best
offering
i
have
had
from
magic
hat
the
other
beers
i
have
had
from
them
were
subpar
this
only
comes
in
the
mixed
12
pack
where
i
am
that
sucks
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
a
billowy
two
inches
of
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
poppyseed
muffins
and
oranges
it
is
an
interesting
aroma
but
unpleasant
the
taste
is
more
subdued
there
is
still
a
lot
of
lemon
and
some
orange
but
it
isnt
as
harsh
as
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
texture
that
is
quite
watery
for
the
style
overall
i
will
pass
on
this
beer
next
time
overall
a
good
beer
from
the
guys
at
magic
hat
pours
a
white
3
finger
head
that
fades
rather
quickly
golden
colored
body
tastes
sweet
a
little
spice
note
no
hops
at
all
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
well
done
overall
would
have
again
in
fact
when
in
the
mood
for
a
hefeweizen
this
beer
comes
in
front
overall
a
decent
beer
d
refreshing
and
crisp
as
easy
to
drink
as
your
popular
american
adjuncts
without
the
watery
corn
flavors
perfect
for
sessions
drink
is
average
not
a
bad
beer
tho
d
very
drinkable
overall
a
nice
and
balanced
sweetness
and
citrus
flavor
the
yeasty
flavor
might
be
a
bit
much
for
some
but
for
most
part
it
is
really
nice
for
the
most
part
drinkability
for
a
wheatstyle
beer
it
lacking
in
some
elements
but
overall
it
is
very
clean
and
pleasant
to
drink
d
very
smooth
creamy
and
swett
easy
to
drink
too
bad
there
are
three
of
these
in
my
sampler
pack
should
have
saved
an
extra
9
to
wash
this
down
with
oh
well
lesson
learned
i
suppose
smells
lemony
with
that
wheat
in
the
back
very
nice
spicy
bite
with
that
dry
lemon
wheat
husk
taste
it
reminded
me
of
a
more
spicy
samuel
adams
coastal
wheat
that
was
my
very
first
impression
but
this
had
a
more
full
flavor
which
i
enjoyed
more
so
than
the
coastal
wheat
these
types
of
beers
are
perfect
for
a
jump
for
people
who
want
to
try
something
other
than
the
big
3
yet
they
always
seem
to
go
for
these
wheat
fruity
type
beers
blue
moon
this
one
etc
thats
fine
though
these
are
good
ill
always
take
these
beers
over
the
regular
stuff
simply
said
magic
hat
makes
some
good
beers
that
can
turn
a
lot
of
people
onto
better
beer
drinkability
not
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
im
a
big
fan
of
lemongrass
but
less
wouldve
been
more
in
this
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
for
it
again
this
one
surprised
me
really
not
really
a
hefe
or
belgian
white
fan
especially
when
they
add
citrus
flavors
i
assumed
this
would
be
akin
to
a
lemon
spritzer
i
prefer
beer
that
tastes
like
well
beer
looked
ok
in
the
glass
actually
surprising
clear
for
something
called
a
hefeweizen
maybe
they
need
to
check
the
definition
of
the
german
word
and
the
smell
was
pretty
clean
predominantly
light
malted
wheat
with
no
citrus
present
the
initial
flavor
was
great
somewhat
clean
and
biscuity
with
a
subtle
lemon
flavor
that
wasnt
citrusy
at
all
but
had
the
character
of
a
flavor
hidden
in
the
hops
matrix
so
i
checked
the
bottle
lemon
grass
no
wonder
not
really
lemon
at
all
but
a
really
unique
and
surprisingly
pleasant
flavor
that
enhanced
the
wheat
i
liked
this
a
lot
and
i
cant
wait
to
share
it
with
someone
i
know
j
who
is
an
american
wheat
fan
d
very
smooth
and
refreshing
d
nice
and
refreshing
i
think
id
enjoy
it
more
if
it
wasnt
winter
well
balanced
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
this
is
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
that
i
feel
would
be
great
to
have
on
a
nice
spring
day
by
itself
however
circus
boy
is
a
very
bland
beer
and
definetly
not
one
that
tastes
looks
or
pours
like
a
hefe
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
beer
to
have
a
hot
summer
day
when
youre
looking
for
refreshment
not
much
more
other
than
that
nice
and
light
for
a
hot
night
but
still
a
good
beer
when
youre
looking
for
something
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
first
beers
i
tell
someone
to
buy
if
they
ask
me
for
a
new
beer
to
try
a
nice
beer
for
a
beginner
who
wants
to
open
up
their
options
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
but
still
good
for
what
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
tried
this
was
on
tap
at
a
restaurant
with
a
name
like
circus
boy
i
had
to
try
it
i
enjoyed
it
enough
to
want
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
which
i
eventually
did
here
i
am
years
later
reviewing
it
i
think
i
liked
it
more
back
then
than
now
my
tastes
have
changed
in
a
beer
but
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
good
i
dont
mean
to
be
a
downer
but
this
beer
is
so
bland
and
off
the
mark
of
what
it
is
advertised
as
that
i
dont
know
how
they
get
away
with
the
label
a
sizebale
fail
for
magic
hat
this
isnt
a
bad
drink
by
any
means
it
is
a
bit
watered
down
compared
to
many
other
beers
in
the
style
its
not
to
heavy
and
does
have
a
good
citris
flavor
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
the
complexity
that
you
normal
see
in
this
style
brew
d
the
beer
isnt
difficult
to
drink
and
its
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
very
sessionable
although
i
wouldnt
consider
it
to
be
very
thirstquenching
d
while
this
beer
isnt
amazing
i
can
see
it
being
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
getting
through
a
6pack
pretty
easily
not
an
amazing
representation
of
the
style
and
the
bland
taste
really
bring
this
one
down
db
the
problem
here
is
a
lack
of
balance
the
floral
and
clove
notes
simply
take
over
and
kill
the
experience
as
with
many
american
takes
on
german
styles
it
feels
artificial
almost
like
a
macro
with
some
spice
light
grain
grass
and
lots
of
butter
its
certainly
not
a
hef
no
banana
or
clove
but
with
all
the
buttery
diacetyl
its
almost
more
of
an
english
pale
wheat
crisp
carbonation
cuts
through
the
butter
d
ehm
overall
mabye
its
just
hitting
me
the
wrong
way
but
theres
so
many
better
authentic
hefeweizens
out
there
why
would
you
waste
your
time
with
this
i
have
long
enjoyed
circus
boy
and
finally
have
gotten
around
to
reviewing
it
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
unfiltered
and
unfettered
as
the
good
folks
in
burlington
advertise
pour
is
as
advertised
cloudy
noise
is
of
lemongrass
and
citrus
ive
always
thought
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
ideal
as
an
introduction
to
anyone
interested
in
the
hefe
style
you
can
and
i
have
enjoy
more
than
one
circus
boy
circus
boy
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
thin
head
that
lasted
fairly
long
the
aroma
was
banana
citrus
and
pine
well
balanced
the
flavor
began
with
grapefruit
followed
by
candy
and
honey
notes
this
beer
has
a
pleasant
citrus
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
creamy
consistency
but
the
only
knock
is
way
too
much
carbonation
magic
hat
circus
boy
is
a
quality
beer
very
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
the
carbonation
recommended
pours
lemon
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
very
faint
some
lemon
citrus
hops
and
a
touch
of
yeast
but
not
a
whole
lot
taste
is
very
light
the
sour
lemoncitrus
hops
come
up
front
and
a
sweet
wheat
malt
finish
wraps
it
up
mouthfeel
has
little
carbonation
and
almost
no
body
mostly
a
mild
lemon
sourness
it
seems
that
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
alone
during
the
summer
but
it
is
completely
overpowered
by
any
food
as
the
flavor
is
refined
but
almost
as
light
as
a
macro
light
beer
i
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
with
food
or
weather
that
isnt
sunny
and
over
80
degrees
good
on
the
drinkability
meter
pretty
clean
flavors
and
certainly
nothing
offensive
just
lacks
some
of
the
rich
and
flavorful
profiles
of
a
good
hefeweizen
d
not
the
tastiest
wheat
beer
but
not
horrible
a
decent
brew
overall
one
of
my
favorite
magic
hats
circus
boy
has
the
perfect
balance
of
flavor
and
spice
the
carbonation
is
not
too
strong
and
the
beer
does
not
taste
watery
in
the
slightest
overall
a
great
beer
that
does
not
get
boring
or
sickening
after
1
or
2
something
that
you
can
drink
and
never
get
bored
of
i
dream
of
the
day
i
can
have
this
on
tap
super
drinkable
but
will
definitely
catch
up
with
you
if
youre
not
careful
protip
i
was
not
careful
drinkability
drinkable
but
not
that
beery
overall
not
a
good
example
of
a
hefeweizen
or
an
american
wheat
its
too
bad
breweries
like
their
marketing
guys
name
these
beers
this
is
more
like
a
summer
seasonal
id
actually
say
this
beer
is
kind
of
awkward
and
unpleasant
to
drink
the
phenolic
elements
really
take
away
from
the
overall
impression
im
generally
not
super
impressed
with
magic
hat
beers
and
this
actually
undershoots
that
impression
a
little
id
pass
on
this
one
unless
your
a
huge
fan
of
seasonal
lemony
wheat
beers
i
got
one
in
a
mix
and
match
pack
after
a
quarter
of
the
beer
i
ended
up
dumping
it
out
which
anyone
who
knows
me
would
say
is
unbelievable
if
compared
to
other
hefeweizens
this
really
suffers
for
taste
nothing
robust
nothing
really
enjoyable
kind
of
a
like
a
nice
smooth
and
pleasant
wheat
very
drinkable
subtle
bits
of
banana
and
a
lot
of
wheat
but
not
much
to
get
excited
about
body
is
very
light
and
watery
with
some
small
carbonation
pours
a
straw
yellowish
color
with
a
nice
white
head
kind
of
looks
like
a
hoegarden
at
first
glance
very
tart
citrus
aroma
but
not
overwhelming
rather
subtle
in
the
smell
taste
is
very
nice
with
well
balanced
lemon
grass
and
other
citrus
flavors
goes
down
very
smooth
with
a
crisp
refreshing
taste
lingering
on
the
palate
very
easy
to
drink
m
d
drain
pour
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
spare
head
spare
lacing
and
lively
carbonation
sweet
grainy
malts
and
hints
of
lemon
and
citrus
slight
fizzy
taste
light
body
and
short
flavor
duration
finishes
fairly
tart
all
around
average
beer
nothing
too
impressive
at
all
great
drinkablity
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
smooth
dill
have
one
here
and
there
on
acount
my
girl
loves
them
it
gets
points
for
maken
her
happy
d
you
know
what
its
really
drinkable
not
a
lot
of
alcoholic
bite
to
it
but
it
has
a
flavor
you
cant
get
from
the
usual
domestic
fare
if
its
not
absurdly
priced
above
any
of
them
its
a
nice
pickup
for
a
summer
bbq
m
light
and
smooth
this
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
the
cap
read
a
good
mind
is
a
horrible
thing
to
baste
it
pours
an
yellow
hay
like
flavor
with
a
almost
thick
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
but
leaves
a
white
lacing
as
you
drink
the
flavor
is
very
light
and
citrusy
this
is
a
beer
that
is
best
enjoyed
on
a
springsummer
evening
although
it
tastes
good
year
round
garnish
the
beer
with
a
lemon
to
enhance
the
citrus
taste
in
addition
its
best
to
pour
this
beer
into
a
glass
while
pausing
half
way
through
pouring
to
swirl
the
rest
of
the
bottles
contents
d
nothing
too
big
about
this
could
have
a
couple
one
of
my
preferred
magic
hat
brews
it
isnt
over
the
top
and
not
too
convoluted
for
the
style
a
habit
the
brewery
tends
to
dabble
in
a
little
too
much
for
me
overall
a
solid
work
i
must
first
note
that
im
not
a
fan
of
wheats
and
this
beer
is
very
wheaty
that
said
an
overwhelming
wheat
smell
with
a
thick
white
head
and
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
it
has
slightly
spiciness
thats
not
overwhelming
the
beer
starts
sweet
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
sweetness
and
finishes
spicy
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
average
but
they
get
a
good
from
me
because
i
think
the
ensemble
is
a
decent
above
average
beer
very
fullbodied
inclined
rather
to
their
german
weizen
predecessors
although
a
bit
drier
to
the
palate
not
too
sweet
not
full
of
bananas
or
cloves
or
bubble
gum
simply
drywheaty
sort
of
like
a
field
somewhere
in
america
sunny
and
full
bodied
refreshing
still
tough
enough
to
drink
during
winter
good
overall
could
drink
this
all
day
drinkability
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
could
be
tasted
throughout
the
daynight
the
bottle
purports
to
be
a
hefeweizen
but
it
seems
to
be
quite
different
than
your
run
of
the
mill
nice
take
by
the
magic
hat
brewing
company
d
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
easy
to
drink
session
beer
definitely
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
aroma
is
of
wheat
and
bread
with
citrus
notes
lemon
beneath
it
taste
is
slightly
sour
from
the
lemon
with
a
bitter
metallic
taste
that
follows
into
the
finish
pretty
carbonated
which
leaves
a
fizzy
mouthfeel
overall
i
am
not
too
impressed
d
drinkable
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
but
not
the
best
tasting
i
had
higher
expectations
id
take
a
sam
adams
hefe
over
this
one
this
was
a
suggestion
from
my
son
one
of
his
favorites
from
college
i
have
to
admit
that
this
is
a
good
hefe
it
has
a
bit
of
an
acidic
note
to
it
but
it
isnt
bitter
i
would
imagine
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
thirst
quenching
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
momentarily
doesnt
have
much
retension
and
laces
just
a
bit
on
the
glass
where
the
head
previously
resided
both
the
aroma
and
taste
are
full
of
lemon
and
rightfully
so
since
the
label
states
it
is
brewed
with
lemongrass
up
front
it
is
a
little
sweet
and
it
finishes
quite
crisp
you
can
pick
up
on
a
slight
bit
of
citrus
other
than
lemon
in
the
finish
as
well
high
amount
of
carb
and
thin
light
feel
which
is
expected
for
the
style
i
am
a
little
bummed
out
that
there
isnt
any
banana
or
clove
character
in
either
the
nose
or
the
taste
but
it
still
fits
the
bill
not
bad
overall
but
i
am
content
with
just
trying
this
once
there
are
others
i
prefer
but
it
was
worth
the
experience
for
the
lemongrass
addition
for
me
this
is
another
good
beer
from
the
people
at
magic
hat
pours
a
clear
golden
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
slight
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
yeast
wheat
slight
orange
and
some
grain
fits
the
style
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
citrus
yeast
tart
malt
and
slight
metallic
overall
high
carbonation
level
hurts
drinkability
as
does
the
metallic
sharpness
allinall
a
very
average
hefe
from
magic
hat
d
decent
drinkability
and
could
be
a
session
beer
in
the
summer
months
the
problem
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
so
creamy
that
it
could
become
irritating
after
the
third
or
fourth
in
a
row
otherwise
its
a
pretty
good
option
for
a
wheat
beer
a
solid
drinkale
beer
that
would
be
welcome
on
a
hot
day
crispy
carbonated
and
all
around
pretty
good
magic
hat
has
classified
this
beer
as
a
hefeweizen
and
if
thats
the
case
this
is
off
the
mark
quite
a
bit
its
still
a
drinkable
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
of
this
style
this
is
clearly
not
it
part
of
a
variety
12
pack
that
one
of
my
brother
in
laws
buddies
brought
over
while
we
were
helping
them
move
out
of
a
12
ounce
bottle
and
into
a
tumbler
appears
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
bone
white
foam
nose
and
flavors
are
of
tangy
lemon
toasted
wheat
yeasty
bready
more
citrus
mildly
spicy
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
levels
and
a
somewhat
sweet
finish
my
least
favorite
out
of
the
12
pack
m
well
carbonated
goes
down
smooth
could
spend
an
evening
with
a
six
pack
of
circus
boy
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
almost
too
drinkable
on
a
sunny
day
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
limited
magic
hat
beers
ive
had
flavor
is
pretty
bland
and
again
has
hints
of
lemon
zest
citrus
lemon
peel
pepper
biscuit
subtle
hops
and
a
sweet
dry
finish
this
beer
was
mediocre
in
every
aspect
and
i
would
avoid
it
in
the
future
notes
when
i
took
the
first
whiff
something
seemed
a
little
strange
and
that
still
holds
true
its
interesting
because
it
is
definitely
a
little
different
than
a
typical
wheat
beer
or
hefeweizen
but
they
didnt
quite
nail
this
one
for
me
the
taste
is
good
but
not
great
overall
a
solid
above
average
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
beer
is
a
moderately
hazy
dark
straw
color
with
a
slight
head
the
aroma
is
faint
and
pretty
neutralsome
wheat
malt
is
all
it
has
going
for
it
the
taste
is
more
interesting
though
with
whatever
yeast
used
producing
a
lot
of
fruitiness
together
with
a
pleasant
tartness
that
makes
it
very
refreshing
the
finish
is
tart
and
lightly
sour
d
good
flavor
and
low
abv
makes
this
a
very
sessionable
ale
definitley
a
summer
beer
this
is
really
easy
to
drink
probably
due
to
its
abv
and
summery
vibe
but
this
is
not
the
hefeweizen
that
the
bottle
claims
it
to
be
and
those
seeking
such
a
thing
should
definitely
look
elsewhere
poured
from
a
brown
12oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
light
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus
and
spices
taste
is
lemony
some
grains
and
spices
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
selection
a
nice
looking
beer
with
its
cloudy
golden
color
and
large
white
head
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
as
the
head
recedes
and
the
beer
is
consumed
unfortunately
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
hefeweizen
or
wheat
ale
the
lemongrass
is
too
prominant
and
the
typical
wheat
beer
qualities
are
suppressed
feels
nice
while
drinking
because
of
a
soft
texture
the
body
is
light
without
being
watery
the
flavor
is
not
my
thing
so
i
will
not
be
buying
this
beer
again
perfect
for
a
summers
afternoon
overall
it
no
longer
is
listed
as
a
hefeweizen
and
within
its
newfound
pale
wheat
it
is
par
for
the
course
purists
may
not
enjoy
the
added
citrus
but
it
is
put
together
in
a
rather
balanced
matter
pretty
hazy
dark
golden
color
small
white
head
takes
off
pretty
quickly
very
nice
wheat
beer
smell
lots
of
banana
and
clove
nice
wheat
malt
lots
of
the
nice
ancillary
wheat
beer
tastes
banana
and
clove
a
bit
acidic
on
the
tongue
but
pretty
creamy
overall
in
the
mouth
very
refreshing
drink
i
like
it
circus
boy
is
magic
hats
hefeweizen
it
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
hint
of
amber
the
head
is
fizzy
and
subsides
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
plain
mostly
just
boiled
hops
no
straw
hay
or
bread
its
definitely
a
sweet
brew
it
starts
sweet
and
the
honeyish
flavor
stays
on
the
edges
of
the
tongue
from
the
mid
to
the
back
there
is
a
bit
of
coriander
and
spice
but
the
flavor
stops
about
there
just
like
the
aroma
this
hefe
is
missing
the
core
components
no
earthiness
no
breadiness
no
citrus
and
too
sweet
for
what
its
trying
to
be
the
positive
is
that
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
thats
about
all
i
can
say
about
it
magic
hat
has
much
much
better
stuff
this
is
disappointing
overall
good
summer
or
gameday
drinkable
beer
funny
how
when
i
bought
the
magic
hat
pack
i
liked
this
best
and
thought
the
odd
notion
was
a
bomb
i
wonder
if
the
scores
are
relatively
poor
because
the
bottle
says
the
hefeweizen
and
people
really
have
a
stick
up
their
butt
when
it
comes
to
what
is
and
isnt
one
this
style
is
populated
with
apas
made
with
wheat
and
what
are
more
or
less
americanstyle
hefeweizens
of
the
latter
this
is
of
the
better
ones
certainly
a
breeze
to
drink
also
this
beer
is
4
4
abv
not
5
5
and
it
should
be
called
a
hefeweizen
not
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
d
decent
this
beer
confused
and
intrigued
me
im
not
sure
what
style
to
judge
it
on
it
says
hefe
but
here
it
says
pale
wheat
i
think
it
falls
more
into
the
pale
wheat
area
but
either
way
its
pretty
enjoyable
with
my
dog
on
a
hot
late
summer
day
d
drinkable
but
there
are
definitely
better
options
out
there
wont
be
seeking
again
rotation
one
and
done
better
out
there
maybe
on
tap
if
down
to
this
and
bmc
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
frothy
inch
head
smells
pretty
bad
actually
like
a
mix
of
bad
yeast
and
acetaldehyde
taste
is
average
with
just
a
hint
of
lemon
no
spice
is
anywhere
to
be
found
in
this
one
smooth
refreshing
good
for
a
summer
day
as
a
substitute
for
a
pale
ale
d
i
wasnt
too
impressed
a
little
too
filling
for
my
taste
awesome
summer
beer
for
a
hot
day
d
due
to
the
citrus
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
could
definitely
down
a
couple
of
these
on
a
summer
afternoon
d
not
a
bad
hef
nice
beer
to
have
in
the
cooler
for
the
summertime
firstly
i
do
not
normally
like
hefewiesens
but
i
have
found
circus
boy
to
have
the
right
amount
of
citrus
to
be
refreshing
but
not
overpowering
i
like
many
other
unfiltered
wheat
beers
and
buy
this
one
on
a
regular
basis
ive
noticed
it
has
hints
of
banana
when
coming
out
of
the
tap
but
is
much
fresher
out
of
a
bottle
magic
hat
seems
to
be
moving
towards
capturing
the
craft
beer
entrylevel
market
which
isnt
overly
glamorous
to
veteran
bas
but
is
probably
important
to
the
long
term
health
of
craft
beer
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
guess
but
this
one
is
def
not
my
fav
magic
hat
d
pretty
great
nice
offering
from
magic
hat
id
drink
again
various
hues
within
the
glass
ranging
from
goldenrod
to
carmel
frothy
lace
and
decent
head
many
rising
bubles
to
the
top
of
the
glass
smells
very
fresh
with
aromas
of
citrus
and
wheat
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
and
crisp
tastes
wheaty
and
somewaht
yeasty
with
a
citrus
tinge
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
above
average
i
feel
this
is
a
quality
heff
and
would
drink
this
again
last
year
i
was
buying
these
regularly
extolling
their
virtues
to
friends
oh
how
my
palate
has
changed
d
nice
light
summer
beer
with
just
enough
flavor
dont
drink
and
review
d
this
beer
has
an
awkward
combination
of
flavors
that
never
seems
to
sit
quite
right
in
my
mouth
the
yeast
and
wheatmalt
seem
to
be
conflicting
with
the
lemongrass
leaving
a
weird
bitter
sensation
although
maybe
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
got
this
beer
in
the
magic
hat
spring
variety
pack
and
i
would
not
get
it
again
sorry
magic
hat
your
beers
are
a
little
too
off
the
wall
for
me
i
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
others
but
it
would
not
be
on
my
list
of
top
unfiltered
wheat
beers
this
and
feast
of
fools
are
two
of
this
brands
better
beers
in
my
opinion
the
body
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
the
average
frothy
head
leads
to
some
nice
lacing
it
has
pasture
and
fruit
aroma
the
tones
of
grains
lemon
and
banana
are
somewhat
strong
for
an
american
wheat
beer
the
body
is
moderately
thick
with
great
carbonation
it
is
very
refreshing
d
i
would
drink
this
all
day
long
easily
and
with
such
a
low
alcohol
content
i
think
i
could
it
actually
says
4
4
on
the
bottle
this
beer
gets
high
marks
for
drinkability
and
for
taste
simply
because
i
feel
its
a
good
representation
of
style
and
goes
down
easy
very
sessionable
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
gives
way
to
a
slight
lacing
there
is
sediement
in
the
bottle
and
it
has
a
nice
unfiltered
look
to
it
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
with
a
slight
lemon
and
banana
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
of
wheat
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
a
hint
of
grassyness
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
with
out
carbonation
the
drinkability
on
this
is
good
you
can
have
it
over
and
over
again
its
not
complex
as
other
hefs
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
a
lot
about
this
beer
is
sort
of
a
standard
hefe
certainly
better
than
any
macro
garbage
but
middle
of
the
road
as
far
as
hefes
go
what
sets
it
a
bit
apart
is
the
lemongrass
the
citrus
character
that
is
contributed
to
the
beer
is
really
a
great
addition
the
use
of
lemongrass
specifically
as
opposed
to
just
lemon
juice
or
some
otehr
straight
forward
fruit
citrus
also
contributes
an
interesting
character
to
the
flavor
with
a
floral
sort
of
presence
that
in
a
way
is
reminiscent
of
hops
but
slightly
different
other
than
that
the
other
thing
to
note
would
be
a
very
good
drinkability
the
light
mouthfeel
and
body
give
it
an

quality
that
makes
drinking

quite
easy
it
also
pairs

with

variety

it
seems
smell
was
of

slight

taste
was
similar
pronounced

overall
tone
with
little
else
for
me
not
much
of
the
usual

flavor
im
used
to
very
muted
and
light
mouthfeel
was
average
drinkability
was
good
easy
to
put
it
down
due
to
the
mild
flavor
but
when
out
shopping
for
hefes
in
better
stores
i
would
probably
pass
on
this
one
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
these
all
of
the
time
but
they
are
drinkable
enough
to
session
a
few
drinkability
like
all
wheat
beers
crisp
and
refreshing
always
good
cold
one
of
the
better
offerings
by
magic
hat
while
you
could
still
have
a
few
a
decent
example
of
the
style
though
a
bit
light
on
flavor
and
offers
little
spice
d
pretty
drinkable
brew
especially
during
the
summer
it
just
really
doesnt
leave
me
asking
for
more
which
is
the
problem
overall
an
ok
brew
but
nothing
special
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
but
wouldnt
turn
one
away
either
by
the
way
the
bottle
says
this
is
a
hefe
but
it
does
taste
more
like
a
pale
wheat
d
although
this
is
nothing
special
i
think
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
hot
days
when
they
happen
for
9
95
for
a
growler
i
cant
complain
overall
while
being
quite
the
sessionable
beer
the
lack
of
depth
and
strong
pronounced
profile
leave
it
a
tick
above
average
still
though
this
would
not
be
bad
at
all
in
a
pinch
high
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
not
bad
could
easily
drink
a
few
on
a
hot
day
but
would
rather
have
something
with
a
bit
more
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
and
nicely
carbonated
an
easy
drinker
just
not
much
there
look
for
their
others
not
this
one
another
refreshing
hefe
i
could
definitely
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
warm
summer
day
and
loving
every
minute
of
it
d
easy
enough
to
drink
reminiscent
of
summer
months
and
sunshine
smooth
going
down
if
these
tasted
a
little
betterstronger
i
would
enjoy
a
six
pack
more
often
very
yellow
with
chill
haze
it
has
a
very
subdued
smell
and
all
i
get
from
it
is
a
small
hint
of
lemon
zest
light
taste
but
has
a
great
spice
hint
half
way
through
lemony
and
malty
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
sweet
and
goes
down
with
a
hefe
dryness
very
drinkable
and
light
however
i
dont
like
its
low
alcohol
content
i
dont
like
wheat
beers
but
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
an
absolute
treasure
much
better
than
other
wheat
beers
i
have
tried
and
blows

this
is
a

quite

drinkability
a
very
mild

approachable
beer
not
as
much

as
many

but
still
flavorful
reminds
me
of

i
brewed
once
on

a

version
d
this

is

made
me

surprisingly

the

i

thats

its

a

on

also

nothing

from

in

had

of

than
some
of
the

wheats
ive
tried
not
bad
at
all
the
beer
interesting
but
not
great
the
bitterness
seems
slightly
full
for
what
it
is
id
rather
see
a
touch
more
sweetness
in
play
with
the
pepper
and
lemon
in
comparison
with
other
examples
of
the
style
however
its
at
least
got
some
character
to
it
worth
trying
not
too
shabby
for
the
style
but
most
folks
would
probably
be
happier
with
an
authentic
hefe
weiss
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
ammount

a
really
easy

id
love
to
grip
a
sixer
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
sudsy
slick
a
bit
chewy
overall
a
highly
drinkable
brew
im
surprised
it
doesnt
have
a
higher
rating
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
with
some
great
chinese
overall
im
not
the
least
bit
impressed
by
this
offering
not
recomended
buy
something
else
i
enjoy
hefeweizens
so
i
trully
enjoyed
this
beer
as
first
taste
i
thought
it
tasted
familar
from
a
magic
hat
mystery
beer
from
last
year
the
rep
said
i
was
right
that
370
was
the
basis
for
this
recipe
if
you
liked
370
then
i
would
definetly
suggest
you
give
this
a
try
unlike
many
hefeweizens
you
dont
need
the
lemon
though
it
already
has
enough
lemon
in
it
to
make
it
very
drinkable
i
think
it
will
be
a
good
summer
beer
and
will
be
competing
with
my
ufo
drinking
the
taste
was
also
citrusy
it
was
a
very
crisp
taste
it
left
something
of
a
carbonated
feeling
in
your
mouth
even
after
you
swallowed
it
it
goes
down
smoothly
very
enjoyable
im
looking
forward
to
the
other
two
in
the
box
taste
was
eh
not
bad
but
not
impressive
malty
a
slight
peppery
spice
and
hints
of
banna
but
somewhat
muddled
and
not
overly
impressive
i
as
expecting
more
but
this
circus
was
just
a
side
show
though
i
didnt
dislike
this
one
i
wasnt
crazy
about
it
either
but
then
again
i
guess
pale
wheat
ales
just
arent
my
thing
while
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
with
a
fairly
crisp
hop
bite
as
well
as
some
pleasant
hints
of
clove
and
hay
its
also
just
a
tad
bit
watery
with
a
flavor
that
doesnt
really
satisfy
so
although
i
had
no
problem
finishing
off
the
three
bottles
of
this
that
came
in
the
joes
garage
variety
12pack
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixpack
of
it
i
would
recommend
this
one
only
to
those
who
really
dig
pale
wheat
ales
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
actively
carbonated
this
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
orange
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
the
smell
has
a
earthy
aroma
to
it
along
with
lemon
and
a
nuttyness
to
it
the
taste
is
very
lemony
with
alot
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
has
a
nuttyness
with
some
carmelvery
refreshing
the
mf
is
light
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
good
brew
and
would
have
this
again
good
job
magic

excellent
for
what
it
is
a

beer
i
generally
like
extreme
beers
with
huge
hops
but
now
and
then
crave
a
nice
refreshing
hefeweizen
and
circus
boy
fits
the
bill
almost
a
pun
there
creamy
mouthfeel
taste
is
lemony
with
a
touch
of
apricot
toned
down

not
as
pallid
as

smell
is
yeasty
spicy

taste
brings
out
the
wheat
but
very
little
spiciness
but
lots
of
oranges
and
lemon
there
seems
to
a
strong
tang
to
the
taste
im
not
sure
if
its
from
the
hops
but
i
am
enjoying
it
more
and
more
with
each
taste
finish
is
pleasant
and
loaded
with
more
citrus
and
what
i
can
best
describe
as
a
ginger
ale
feeling
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
this
is
a
good
beer
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
did
enjoy
it
thanks
to
phatz
for
the
trade
overall
an
unexciting
beer
from
the
boys
in
vermont
mfd
very
carbonated
the
feel
is
slick
and
wet
but
not
to
heavy
this
is
not
very
drinkable
and
a
weak
attempt
at
the
style
i
know
they
can
do
better
and
dumping
in
a
shitload
of
lemons
doesnt
do
it
from
me
from
the
1810
crew
golden
yellow
barely
hazy
nice
white
head
though
smells
of
lemon
and
with
a
little
yeast
and
sour
wheat
taste
is
pleasant
but
lackluster
there
are
hops
somewhere
in
there
some
sweet
wheat
malts
some
more
sourness
and
citrus
easy
drinking
but
not
that
enticing
to
have
many
more
its
a
pretty
pale
wheat
beer
something
for
the
uninitiated
maybe
clouded
gold
fat
white
frothy
head
lemony
aroma
with
hints
of
sourish
wheat
and
banana
some
clove
lemony
wheat
flavor
right
up
front
the
lemon
seems
kind
of
artificial
like
it
doesnt
belong
in
the
flavor
profile
if
this
is
the
batch
370
i
liked
it
much
better
in
its
previous
incarnation
a
much
more
authentic
bavarian
feel
dryish
and
powdery
mouthfeel
a
sparkling
carbonation
keeps
things
lively
seems
like
theres
fairly
strong
citrusy
hops
which
feels
out
of
place
with
this
beer
then
again
the
citrus
feels
like
more
the
product
of
one
of
those
lemon
shaped
lemon
juice
bottles
than
hops
or
actual
lemon
kinda
wierd
it
is
refreshing
and
satisfies
my
desire
for
a
beer
but
id
be
happier
with
something
else
not
quite
what
i
want
for
late
winter
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
copper

with

really
stands

of

this
is
an
wheat
ale
but
it
is
filtered
wheat
ale
this
is
not
not
like
your
typical
wheat
brews
on
the
market
that
are
unfiltered
hocus
pocus
pours
out
a
nice
golden
amber
color
with
a
white
head
nice
and
crystal
clear
the
smell
is
nice
and
clean
you
pick
up
on
kiss
of
wheat
the
taste
is
bold
with
a
little
bite
of
citrus
to
it
there
is
some
citrus
and
grains
nothing
bad
about
taste
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
there
is
nothing
over
powering
in
this
beer
this
beer
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
and
clean
the
finish
is
nice
and
clean
magic
hat
brewing
company
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
i
would
get
this
brew
again
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
a
3
75
overall
i
fully
understand
why
this
is
a
pale
wheat
beer
because
to
me
this
has
all
of
the
traits
of
a
witbier
but
to
a
lesser
degree
this
would
be
a
very
refreshing
summer
brew
i
will
buy
this
brew
again
this
pours
a
clear
yellow
straw
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
a
watered
down
lemon
wheat
beer
the
after
taste
is
slightly
tart
and
a
little
offputting
the
texture
is
thin
with
not
much
happening
not
terrible
but
this
could
be
better
a
decent
wheat
beer
with
just
a
hint
of
lemony
hops
but
not
much
in
the
way
of
flavor
beyond
that
a
half
step
above
the
commercial
beers
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
sweet
overall
a
little
hoppy
decent
finish
meh
its
an
american
style
wheat
beer
not
a
repeat
for
me
this
beer
pours
up
a
crystal
clear
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
foamy
two
finger
head
world
class
retention
and
world
class
lacing
the
smell
is
mostly
oranges
taste
is
fairly
one
dimensional
just
a
hint
of
oranges
without
a
lot
of
hops
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
metallic
i
guess
this
one
is
okay
as
a
session
beer
but
for
me
i
think
ill
pass
on
more
of
these
this
is
a
bit
disappointing
the
flavors
seems
a
bit
muddled
im
impressed
that
this
is
only
13
ibus
the
hops
to
me
are
evident
throughout
with
a
toned
down
herbal
spicy
note
the
overall
flavor
is
a
decent
wheat
beer
but
this
isnt
something
that
i
would
drink
again
ill
pass
i
usually
find
magic
hats
beers
fairly
bland
but
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
pours
from
the
bottle
with
a
bright
yelloworange
color
the
aroma
is
a
light
mix
of
musty
yet
bright
hop
bitterness
a
little
lemon
and
some
earthy
wheat
the
flavor
largely
features
a
biscuity
almost
tangy
light
malt
sweetness
but
there
is
also
a
bit
of
dry
herbal
hops
to
balance
like
the
flavor
the
texture
is
light
but
not
too
thin
overall
this
beer
is
light
and
drinkable
but
it
has
a
nice
mild
yet
varied
flavor
profile
that
lifts
it
above
bland
to
subtly
pleasant
hocus
pocus
pours
a
golden
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
keeping
a
relatively
small
head
afloat
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
sweet
malts
grains
and
wheat
the
taste
is
simple
and
thirstquenching
with
lemon
over
a
refreshing
backbone
of
wheat
and
grains
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
suggests
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
great
overall
this
is
a
tasty
american
wheat
that
wont
set
the
world
on
fire
but
is
still
a
great
drink
a
light
drinkable
summer
wheat
beer
it
doesnt
have
any
artificial
or
offensive
flavors
and
i
would
have
to
say
it
is
pretty
refreshing
good
enough
for
what
you
pay
overall
its
not
my
typical
style
of
beer
that
i
prefer
i
would
definitely
choose
my
goto
hefeweizens
over
it
in
fact
i
would
probably
say
that
it
tastes
like
a
mix
between
a
good
hw
and
a
bmc
beer
but
without
the
wonderful
banana
aromas
i
most
desire
from
my
favorite
hefeweizens
i
dont
see
myself
buying
singles
of
this
beer
in
the
future
the
variety
pack
however
has
many
others
i
would
choose
of
this
beer
it
rates
average
to
my
taste
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
when
poured
it
has
a
goldish
color
body
with
a
very
small
fizzy
head
that
fizzes
away
quickly
the
smell
is
light
citrus
and
wheat
the
taste
is
crisp
of
a
light
citrus
and
wheat
and
some
yeast
flavor
comes
through
thats
it
not
too
much
going
on
here
the
mouth
feel
is
crisp
and
nicely
carbonated
overall
this
is
defently
a
summer
time
beer
and
a
easy
drinker
overall
this
beer
is
better
than
i
was
honestly
expecting
it
to
be
magic
hat
doesnt
have
the
best
track
record
with
me
but
this
a
pretty
hoppy
summer
wheat
beer
isnt
so
bad
i
dont
understand
why
its
in
their
fall
variety
pack
but
they
have
always
been
a
little
bit
odd
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
sticks
around
the
smell
is
mostly
hoppy
with
some
hints
of
yeast
and
sweet
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
crisp
with
a
subtle
sweetness
kicking
in
at
the
end
with
a
bit
of
an
earthygrassy
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
nice
flavor
balance
overall
a
good
beer
refreshing
with
lots
of
flavor
o
why
this
got
voted
as
the
winner
for
their
usual
which
beer
will
be
the
4th
in
the
pack
for
their
fall
mixpack
is
beyond
me
definitely
a
summery
beer
hell
its
even
listed
as
a
summer
seasonal
on
here
then
again
thats
not
true
and
people
probably
didnt
realize
it
the
name
sounds
more
like
a
fall
beer
for
sure
but
its
not
end
rant
regardless
of
the
season
now
this
is
a
good
sessionable
beer
that
has
enough
flavor
to
beat
out
the
macro
crew
pick
it
up
in
the
12pack
mixer
enjoy
it
agree
with
my
rant
eh
soso
beer
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
makes
for
a
good
lawnmower
beer
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
like
a
chardonnay
with
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbles
racing
up
to
feed
the
fingerwidth
head
of
fluffy
white
bubbles
lacing
is
dry
and
sheetlike
on
the
glass
the
beer
smells
wet
fresh
and
sweet
with
some
light
hopspice
and
citrus
accentuations
and
a
ghost
of
biscuity
malt
behind
it
the
beer
tastes
bitterly
wheatlike
with
some
nice
citrus
accentuations
the
flavor
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
little
sumpin
sumpin
ale
by
laguinitas
only
not
as
tasty
there
are
some
nice
cascade
hop
notes
in
the
taste
and
an
astringent
bitter
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
like
a
nice
summer
ale
with
a
little
bit
of
an
acidic
bite
from
the
carbonation
the
mouth
is
left
wet
with
saliva
and
a
slight
bitter
burn
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
though
i
cant
say
it
is
my
favorite
the
bitter
is
a
little
too
present
without
a
hop
character
to
tenderize
it
out
on
the
tongue
this
beer
is
mediocre
but
worth
a
try
pours
a

of
slight

slight
yeast
strong

hint
of

slight

and
a
hint

fits
the
style
of
an

feel

smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average

level
tastes
of

slight

and

overall
average

but
good
feel
and
blend
they
said
they
havent
brewed
this
since
2008
i
think
it
may
have
been
prematurely
resurrected
oda
bland
one
has
its
high
points
but
it
is
far
from
memorable
just
another
brew
by
magic
hat
overall
this
is
a
solid
summer
ale
providing
just
the
right
amount
of
light
airy
fare
that
you
crave
on
hot
days
but
not
sacrificing
flavor
or
quality
in
the
process
if
youre
a
fan
of
corona
i
recommend
this
as
a
step
upand
you
wont
even
have
to
add
the
wedge
of
lime
ive
not
been
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
one
is
mild
enough
i
found
it
easy
to
drink
it
started
with
a
couple
of
fingers
of
head
but
lost
the
head
fairly
quickly
a
light
gold
color
and
fairly
clear
for
a
wheat
although
there
is
a
bit
of
cloudiness
to
it
mild
aroma
of
wheat
with
a
bit
of
hops
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
but
the
taste
was
better
than
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
it
would
be
aftertaste
is
bitterness
this
will
never
be
confused
with
the
bigger
heavier
beers
but
when
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
other
than
a
heavy
beer
this
works
this
might
also
make
a
nice
gateway
beer
into
the
world
of
craft
beers
got
some
of
this
before
it
was
put
to
death
by
the
brewery
the
beer
poured
as
a
clean
clear
yellow
colored
beer
the
head
was
a
little
fizzy
and
white
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
nice
suble
wheat
aromas
with
a
light
honey
sweetness
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
light
and
refreshing
just
a
touch
of
sweet
honey
with
some
malted
wheat
the
hops
were
kept
to
a
minimal
amount
in
this
one
the
mouthfeel
was
perfect
for
a
summer
brew
overall
i
wasnt
overly
sad
to
see
this
beer
retired
but
i
know
several
people
who
were
pretty
pissed
about
it
overall
not
bad
i
was
really
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
but
to
be
honest
i
have
had
much
worse
this
was
definitly
a
quality
beer
and
something
that
i
would
probably
not
buy
again
but
would
not
snub
my
nose
at
it
either
poured
a
really
light
yellow
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
and
some
clearly
visible
carbonation
the
nose
is
some
light
citrus
along
with
quite
a
bit
of
grain
the
taste
is
grainy
and
has
some
light
lemon
notes
light
and
crisp
this
was
a
pretty
good
summer
brew
light
somewhat
refreshing
but
doesnt
stand
out
in
comparison
to
other
summer
wheat
beers
poured
from
bottle
to
pint
glass
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
diminished
to
minimal
lacing
it
has
a
mild
lemony
sweet
honey
aroma
the
taste
is
a
mild
wheat
flavor
with
hints
of
lemon
feel
is
clean
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
respectable
summer
session
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
while
at
the
brewery
for
tour
the
aroma
was
light
but
you
could
notice
certain
scents
bitter
citrus
like
grapefruit
and
grainy
malt
aromas
nice
transparent
yellow
color
with
good
head
and
lace
it
has
a
balanced
sweet
and
sour
taste
equal
parts
fruit
and
malt
like
flavor
the
body
is
thin
and
easy
to
drink
it
is
a
great
summer
drink
alot
better
than
i
remember
primarily
because
hops
are
much
more
present
in
the
beer
beer
isnt
big
in
the
flavor
department
but
it
is
very
well
balanced
a
little
disappointed
that
it
wont
be
around
anymore
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
out
at
the
beach
on
a
warm
day
but
unfortunately
i
dont
think
its
coming
back
again
for
a
while

aroma
has
very
pleasingly
subtle
spicy
lemony
twang
flavor
pretty
much
carries
this
theme
through
palatetingling
lemonysour
edge
rereshing
fresh
a
very
good
example
of
an
american
wheat
beer
the
best
magic
hat
offering
i
hae
tried
to
datei
was
not
hopeful
after
the
awful
lucky
kat
this
beer
is
thankfully
much
better
the
taste
is
really
crisp
with
a
mild
sweetness
and
almost
tart
like
character
the
body
is
light
with
plenty
of
carbonation
to
keep
this
refreshing
this
makes
for
a
great
thirst
quenching
quaffable
beer
whether
its
summer
or
early
october
summer
beers
are
on
special
drinkability
not
going
to
be
a
summer
goto
beer
for
me
this
one
just
doesnt
have
too
much
going
on
its
crisp
and
tart
and
refreshing
but
its
pretty
boring
in
my
opinion
not
recommended
i
had
this
beer
throughout
the
summer
and
it
never
disappointed
me
its
easily
drinkable
light
bodied
highly
carbonated
and
has
a
great
lemon
zest
of
flavor
its
also
low
abv
which
helps
because
you
can
easily
knock
back
a
bunch
of
these
a
very
easy
drinker
good
session
beer
for
the
summertime
enough
flavor
to
make
it
worthwhile
and
light
enough
for
mass
quantities
may
not
be
the
best
wheat
beer
in
the
world
but
still
an
enjoyable
drink
off
tap
at
their
south
burlington
brewery
this
beer
was
a
slightly
hazy
gold
white
head
foamed
up
quickly
and
then
receded
again
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
that
remained
for
the
rest
of
the
tasting
the
nose
was
mostly
lemon
peel
and
grapefruit
with
some
light
hops
underneath
the
tastes
were
similar
but
well
rounded
dry
citrus
up
front
followed
by
pale
malt
and
green
apples
medium
to
light
body
and
medium
to
high
carbonation
quite
sessionable
genuinely
refreshing
and
a
good
summer
beer
drinkability
light
and
refreshing
good
summer
beer
may
not
stand
out
amoung
others
in
the
summer
series
but
still
a
solid
enjoyable
beer
had
this
at
a
bbq
the
other
night
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
so
i
cant
comment
on
the
appearance
im
a
sucker
for
the
seasonal
ales
so
i
went
straight
for
this
when
i
saw
it
in
the
cooler
the
smell
was
refreshing
and
the
taste
was
much
of
the
same
a
little
wheat
with
something
sweet
that
i
couldnt
place
it
is
a
real
smooth
beer
and
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fact
that
i
had
to
drive
home
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
the
entire
6pack
on
a
lazy
summer
evening
i
might
go
and
try
to
procure
some
of
this
before
the
fall
beers
start
pushing
these
off
the
shelves
overall
its
ok
but
not
great
d
pretty
high
because
this
is
so
light
on
flavor
and
easy
drinking
this
is
decent
but
i
have
had
much
better
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
at
all
has
a
cloudy
golden
look
poured
a
decent
head
and
left
a
bit
of
lace
has
a
sweet
type
of
apricot
lemon
taste
to
it
but
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
9
pretty
smooth
going
down
but
tasted
watery
at
times
and
not
a
ton
of
flavor
to
it
still
its
refreshing
and
a
pretty
good
beer
that
id
probably
get
again
hocus
pocus
is
a
pleasant
surprise
from
magic
hat
the
drink
has
fine
zesty
carbonation
that
fits
the
refreshing
flavor
profile
just
about
perfectly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
with
superb
drinkability
the
beer
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
a
light
white
head
the
aroma
was
not
really
all
that
good
slight
citrus
with
a
vague
hint
of
the
grain
my
wife
commented
that
it
smelled
like
a
bandaid
the
taste
was
average
at
best
and
kind
of
followed
the
nose
but
with
a
mix
of
the
grain
and
cirtus
seemed
bland
the
beer
may
have
been
a
bit
overcarbonated
and
was
thin
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
beer
and
seeing
how
this
was
my
first
with
magic
hat
i
am
leary
of
the
rest
of
their
beer
but
i
am
sure
that
i
will
give
them
a
chance
maybe
i
just
dont
care
for
the
style
d
drinks
well
but
i
dont
like
the
taste
served
a
crisp
pale
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
some
weak
sweet
malts
and
fruits
the
taste
is
sweet
fruits
and
slight
citrus
the
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
decent
summer
brew
just
not
one
id
likely
seek
out
again
gc
tastes
like
a
wheat
beer
dry
tart
finish
without
the
puckering
aftertaste
too
many
wheats
have
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
to
set
in
the
shade
grab
each
pass
while
mowing
there
are
plenty
of
better
wheat
beers
out
there
give
them
a
shot
before
you
try
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
poured
into
a
hefe
glass
and
received
a
light
gold
body
with
solid
twofinger
head
that
held
up
well
to
some
good
carbonation
when
it
did
slowly
receed
left
a
night
lace
ring
a
very
fruity
smell
not
jsut
citric
notes
like
orange
peel
and
lemon
but
some
bananas
and
pears
as
well
as
some
minor
spicings
a
good
citric
hop
taste
hit
my
tongue
as
the
mediumbodied
beer
passed
over
smooth
almost
slick
the
beer
is
light
on
spices
but
theyre
there
and
the
yeastwheat
sediments
in
there
give
it
a
somewhat
creamy
and
sweentness
other
might
disagree
but
i
think
this
is
a
great
american
wheat
beer
worth
giving
a
shot
this
one
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
hint
of
haziness
it
has
a
nice
big
white
head
the
flavor
is
nice
and
light
making
this
quite
the
lawnmower
beer
it
has
no
aftertaste
and
is
an
extremely
clean
tasting
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
it
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
for
sure
definitely
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
one
didnt
impress
me
it
has
its
strong
points
but
it
never
wows
you
diving
into
this
beer
i
often
wondered
if
this
were
a
bad
kolsch
a
blonde
ale
a
high
temperature
lager
didnt
think
of
an
american
wheat
the
beer
starts
with
a
mostly
clear
straw
color
fair
initial
head
formation
that
didnt
retain
as
well
as
prefered
aromas
are
partpilsner
malt
partgrain
and
with
a
soft
herbal
floral
hop
note
that
saves
the
aroma
flavors
have
a
better
malt
profile
than
the
nose
suggests
however
the
cereal
grain
flavors
do
come
though
as
well
as
a
coarse
astringency
late
soft
wheat
malt
flavors
are
found
but
only
after
searching
for
them
but
the
wheat
does
little
to
soften
the
textures
or
give
any
rich
breadiness
sweetness
or
body
a
subtle
fruitiness
comes
though
as
pears
and
apples
finishes
with
a
linger
of
the
herbal
hops
and
cereal
grains
d
easy
to
drink
and
low
abv
not
very
interesting
though
mayber
oberon
has
ruined
me
md
light
bodied
carbonation
isnt
too
prickly
a
little
foamy
decent
drinkability
nothing
great
but
entirely
drinkable
this
was
a
pretty
average
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
these
but
nothing
really
stood
out
this
is
perfect
for
summertime
i
dont
usually
gravitate
towards
this
style
of
lawnmower
beer
but
i
definitely
appreciate
the
craft
and
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
dont
drink
and
reivew
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
a
tough
one
to
review
its
in
a
style
thats
not
particularly
outstanding
although
that
is
certainly
drinkable
and
it
basically
does
what
its
supposed
to
there
it
looks
like
a
wheat
ale
smells
mildly
like
a
wheat
ale
it
tastes
like
it
should
the
only
thing
moderately
unique
here
is
that
its
very
citrusy
moreso
than
most
apwas
although
were
not
talking
gumbalhead
zest
by
any
means
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
i
prefer
it
to
magic
hats
other
widely
available
apwa
circus
boy
overall
its
fine
for
the
summer
but
as
with
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
style
nothing
id
seek
out
hints
of
citrus
and
nice
clean
finish
this
poured
golden
with
a
good
amount
of
head
that
quickley
faded
to
a
sloght
ring
arount
the
top
tir
first
sent
was
one
of
wheat
and
hop
the
tast
was
super
i
will
have
to
get
a
few
more
of
thees
for
the
4th
of
july
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
bodied
in
the
mouth
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
make
it
feel
so
this
beer
is
crisp
and
slightly
drying
in
the
finish
very
nice
feel
overall
as
mentioned
earlier
ive
had
better
this
wont
be
one
that
ill
actively
seek
out
in
the
future
it
wont
be
one
that
id
be
caught
in
making
a
decision
with
hocus
pocus
or
beer
x
just
average
nothing
special
but
worth
a
try
i
guess
d
very
drinkable
espeacially
in
the
summer
very
refreshing
and
would
be
great
after
a
hard
days
work
in
the
hard
d
one
of
the
better
summer
ales
far
better
than
samuel
adams
version
if
magic
hat
would
let
go
of
the
fruitherbalspiced
vibe
they
have
a
real
knack
for
brewing
some
nice
beers
see
odd
notion
summer
08
circus
boy
taste
is
more
citrus
lemon
tangerine
orange
and
wheat
almost
a
bit
acidic
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
and
it
feels
pretty
light
bodied
the
down
side
is
the
slight
stickiness
it
leaves
not
quite
the
clean
finish
that
i
want
in
a
summer
beer
drinkability
is
also
decent
it
is
almost
a
good
summer
session
beer
if
they
tone
down
the
citrus
and
the
stickiness
a
tad
then
itd
be
much
better
all
in
all
a
good
summer
ale
not
the
best
ive
had
and
not
terribly
distinct
but
a
good
call
when
you
want
something
both
flavorful
and
refreshing
id
likely
never
buy
this
in
its
own
6
or
12pack
but
its
a
welcome
addition
to
the
summer
variety
pack
i
only
wish
i
could
have
tried
the
gingerlemon
version
of
this
beer
before
it
was
discontinued
just
to
see
if
it
made
the
brew
more
interesting
d
definitely
a
worthy
wheat
ale
good
summertime
brew
i
enjoy
wheats
and
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
it
was
a
decent
selection
that
i
would
dabble
with
again
there
are
many
other
summerstyle
beers
to
choose
from
thin
watery
bland
and
very
forgettable
had
to
chug
an
oberon
immediately
afterwards
to
cleanse
the
palate
drinkability
great
could
do
a
whole
sixer
in
a
night
tastes
great
after
a
long
run
through
the
streets
of
arlington
a
hoppy
wheat
beer
some
taste
but
rather
ordinary
ontap
at
the
brewery
a
bit
of
tartnessand
lemon
in
the
aroma
drinkable
summer
beer
but
bland
oh
and
on
the
thinner
side
not
my
favorite
i
wouldnt
dress
it
up
with
a
lemon
slice
nonoffensive
bottle
b
slightly
psychedelic
green
label
orginal
idea
but
i
hate
bees
worth
a
shot
i
would
simply
like
to
add
that
this
is
a
beer
one
could
stock
up
for
nice
picnic
or
just
any
gathering
no
complaints
very
lightnot
too
much
lemon
so
it
seems
an
ideal
beer
for
what
is
intended
the
worst
offering
i
have
had
from
magic
hat
but
still
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
pretty
drinkable
not
the
first
id
go
for
but
not
a
disappointing
beer
by
any
means
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
highly
carbonated
has
a
sweet
smell
with
wheat
and
lemon
light
herby
flavor
with
a
dry
slightly
skunky
aftertaste
carbonation
cleans
the
palate
but
also
leaves
a
very
dry
feeling
lacks
the
flavor
of
most
wheat
beers
not
craving
another
overall
a
nice
wheat
beer
has
a
bit
more
zing
than
some
of
the
others
in
its
category
fairly
smooth
good
citrus
taste
with
lemon
taking
the
forefront
not
overly
sweet
as
there
is
a
little
bit
of
hop
action
going
on
to
lend
some
bitterness
very
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonated
refreshing
and
drinkable
ale
taste
is
very
mellow
on
the
wheat
side
theres
a
nice
apricot
fruit
note
to
it
as
well
smooth
and
oily
in
the
glass
it
is
a
very
drinkable
wheat
beer
this
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
dissipates
steadily
spotty
lacing
light
aroma
of
wheat
and
citrus
lightbodied
and
citrusy
with
some
mild
wheat
and
malt
flavors
clean
fruity
finish
with
a
touch
of
hops
on
the
end
clearly
meant
to
be
a
lawnmower
beer
but
that
is
no
excuse
not
to
throw
in
a
little
more
flavor
drinkability
i
am
having
a
hard
enough
time
forcing
down
just
one
of
these
in
my
quest
to
try
more
of
magic
hats
delicious
offerings
ive
come
across
hocus
pocus
a
festive
looking
beer
12
oz
bottle
with
a
distinctive
lemon
and
caramel
malts
smell
a
bit
sweet
on
the
nose
and
the
taste
follows
a
bit
overpowering
on
the
caramel
malts
and
sour
lemon
tanginess
carbonated
on
the
tongue
but
nothing
too
special
overall
probably
would
not
drink
more
than
one
of
these
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
at
magic
hat
for
making
such
an
overpowering
pale
wheat
ale
not
really
in
line
with
the
category
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
tiny
fizzy
white
head
some
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
slight
hops
spicy
grassy
and
some
caramel
the
taste
is
maltyhoppy
there
are
some
spices
in
there
good
dose
of
grassiness
and
some
caramel
this
is
a
refreshingsmooth
brew
medium
body
drinkable
goes
good
on
a
hot
day
like
today
drinks
okay
for
what
it
is
watered
down
american
pale
wheats
are
not
my
bag
it
is
very
refreshing
on
the
palate
i
could
drink
this
in
a
single
mouthful
the
malts
come
threw
along
with
a
light
yeasty
fruitiness
the
hops
are
faint
but
they
are
noticeable
d
three
went
down
with
easy
but
the
experience
wasnt
too
enjoyable
still
quite
drinkable
d
a
drinkable
wheat
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
i
have
to
say
as
more
of
these
come
to
market
less
of
them
are
great
d
i
could
have
2
of
these
but
i
think
the
bitterness
would
prove
to
be
too
much
after
the
second
its
nice
for
a
change
of
pace
but
not
a
staple
in
my
fridge
its
not
great
or
anything
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
summer
beers
i
have
had
this
summer
chuck
full
o
flavor
but
something
i
might
not
get
every
week
very
light
little
head
aroma
is
kind
of
floral
maybe
a
hint
of
some
herbal
quality
like
cedar
the
flavor
is
fairly
light
and
crackery
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
and
maybe
some
light
white
wine
character
not
quite
acidic
but
something
like
that
this
is
pretty
light
overall
and
its
a
good
summer
beer
but
not
terribly
exciting
pours
a
little
cloudy
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
it
had
the
aroma
of
a
lemony
dryness
in
the
taste
well
it
had
a
nice
dry
end
but
no
real
taste
at
all
it
kind
of
sticks
to
the
top
of
the
mouth
with
somewhat
of
a
flat
beer
charicteristic
it
was
ok
a
bit
malty
for
a
wheat
and
really
not
much
flavor
at
all
pours
a
four
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
leaving
some
lace
clear
pale
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
slight
hoppy
nose
flavor
begins
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
becomes
balanced
fairly
clean
finsih
good
summer
ale
1
50
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capital
convenience
concord
nh
goes
down
smoothly
through
fine
craftsmanship
or
lack
of
substance
is
debatable
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
beer
could
actually
be
quite
refreshing
poors
a
hazy
straw
color
with
quite
the
inital
head
that
goes
away
after
a
few
mins
the
smell
is
pretty
sweet
but
plesant
with
some
fruit
taste
is
very
easy
going
with
some
citrus
and
wheat
flavors
good
for
a
summer
day
a
good
session
brew
i
would
have
to
say
better
then
sammy
summer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellowgold
with
a
onefinger
frothy
head
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
better
head
stickiness
than
described
in
other
reviews
the
smell
was
primarily
tart
citrus
with
a
trace
of
malt
taste
was
not
bad
but
kind
of
pedestrian
and
forgettable
some
citrusy
tartness
up
front
moving
to
a
mellow
breadiness
and
finishing
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
was
more
fatigued
than
lively
the
finish
evolved
back
into
a
yeast
flavor
as
the
beer
warmed
very
lightbodied
and
a
little
bit
fizzy
not
the
greatest
offering
and
probably
not
one
ill
be
getting
again
but
not
terrible
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
from
its
12oz
home
i
gave
the
bottle
a
nice
squish
to
get
the
rest
of
the
goodness
out
there
was
some
slight
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
freshness
date
clearly
marked
on
the
label
this
brew
is
really
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
this
one
is
perfect
on
any
warm
summer
day
just
relaxing
in
the
sun
the
presentation
was
decent
good
fluffy
white
head
that
did
thin
out
quickly
there
was
a
slight
lace
left
behind
in
the
glass
smell
is
light
and
dough
like
probably
more
from
the
wheat
than
yeast
though
hint
of
sweetness
and
an
almost
dull
euro
lager
scent
maybe
some
touch
of
cloves
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
in
the
background
there
is
a
certain
floral
scent
mixed
in
light
bodied
brew
with
a
smooth
pale
malt
flavor
subtle
floral
hint
in
the
taste
well
balanced
with
the
rather
sweeter
malt
flavor
followed
by
a
slight
bitterness
of
the
hops
good
mouth
feel
and
great
drink
ability
i
certainly
enjoy
this
brew
during
the
summer
months
and
look
forward
to
drinking
it
overall
this
is
a
great
easy
drinking
summertime
session
offering
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
nice
head
that
disappears
quickly
aroma
is
light
sweet
malt
perhaps
some
grassy
hops
taste
a
bit
of
wheat
at
first
but
mostly
malt
a
light
touch
of
hops
not
all
that
exciting
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
more
of
a
wheat
beer
really
so
i
was
kind
of
surprised
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
fairly
light
mouthfeel
thats
about
right
for
this
beer
quite
drinkable
i
could
see
having
a
good
many
of
these
at
a
picnic
kind
of
a
lifeless
offering
from
magic
hat
they
have
tons
of
different
beers
and
theyre
obviously
talented
you
just
get
the
idea
the
quality
would
be
better
if
they
concentrated
more
on
each
style
than
producing
so
many
interesting
but
flawed
brews
d
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
of
this
one
if
they
could
be
blended
better
a
beer
i
would
certainly
drink
again
if
i
have
the
chance
not
horrible
but
not
something
i
would
revisit
just
didnt
sit
right
with
me
for
a
wheat
ale
from
this
brewery
better
off
with
circus
boy
overall
a
decent
intro
to
an
american
wheat
for
a
novice
to
the
style
just
an
average
and
generic
flavor
profile
nothing
that
stands
out
forgetful
d
this
was
a
solid
offering
from
magic
hat
i
would
venture
to
have
this
one
again
its
taste
and
mouthfeel
make
it
very
drinkable
d
good
easy
drinking
summer
wheat
beer
buy
it
try
it
dits
crisp
refreshing
but
other
than
that
theres
really
nothing
to
keep
me
coming
back
this
beer
has
a
spiceoverload
theres
just
too
much
and
they
arent
mixing
well
in
my
book
everything
just
comes
off
a
bit
meatlike
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
aroma
is
less
intense
and
not
bad
with
a
hint
of
lemon
ginger
and
wheat
those
flavors
come
together
in
the
taste
with
god
knows
what
else
for
a
train
wreck
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
not
a
great
first
impression
the
beer
seemed
to
get
better
with
each
taste
would
like
to
try
again
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
in
the
end
12
oz
bottle
best
before
august
2007
pours
up
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
twofingered
bone
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
aromas
of
malted
wheat
whole
grain
bread
with
hints
of
mustiness
lemon
zest
and
hersbrucker
hops
rather
tame
is
the
taste
department
mainly
watery
tasting
with
some
glimpses
of
pale
wheat
citrus
and
a
mildly
sweet
and
faintly
tart
finish
healthy
carbonation
gives
it
a
crisp
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
because
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
it
better
than
some
other
beers
in
the
american
pale
wheat
category
but
certainly
no
showstopper
a
nice
beer
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
to
a
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
pale
and
clean
looking
the
beer
reeked
i
though
in
the
smell
department
selling
like
something
that
had
gone
sour
very
yeasty
smelling
also
the
beer
had
kinda
of
a
grassy
taste
yet
clean
with
a
sweet
aftertaste
still
i
was
just
not
too
keen
on
it
and
will
not
buy
again
this
beer
pours
a
light
pale
color
not
much
head
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
with
strong
hints
of
wheat
and
malt
it
reminds
me
of
a
hefeweizen
but
its
not
quite
that
leaves
a
bready
aftertaste
with
some
resemblance
to
cider
on
the
throat
not
too
bad
light
and
drinkable
for
sure
the
beer
is
golden
yellow
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
34
inch
head
that
settles
to
a
sticky
thin
film
of
white
bubbles
the
smell
is
that
of
buttery
wheat
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
and
a
slight
musty
odor
it
tastes
like
a
typical
wheat
beer
light
crispy
mild
taste
very
easy
to
drink
and
unoffensive
to
the
more
avid
macro
drinker
good
starter
beer
nothing
very
bold
though
average
right
across
the
board
this
is
a
rather
easy
drinker
but
its
also
rather
unexciting
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
ill
go
elsewhere
for
my
american
wheats
in
the
future
drinkability
this
will
be
a
great
summer
brew
to
enjoy
d
maybe
more
enjoyable
in
the
summer
months
but
i
just
couldnt
get
into
it
right
now
very
thin
and
the
flavors
just
werent
there
ill
try
another
in
the
summer
as
i
come
to
expect
a
little
more
from
magic
hat
d
this
beer
is
extremely
easytodrink
and
not
filling
at
all
because
its
so
light
the
only
problem
is
the
lack
of
flavor
its
a
beer
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
in
the
same
way
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
any
macro
small
white
head
very
little
lacing
clear
gold
color
smell
is
of
honey
taste
is
of
honey
with
a
little
hop
clean
light
mouthfeel
not
overly
carbonated
and
no
after
taste
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
honey
taste
in
this
beer
but
ill
give
it
another
try
to
see
if
taste
buds
change
otherwise
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
one
again
as
a
side
note
some
macro
lovers
accidently
drank
one
or
two
of
mine
while
they
werent
paying
attention
they
enjoyed
them
and
their
conversion
to
the
dark
side
is
just
beginning
good
summer
time
brew
im
glad
i
caught
this
beer
before
summertime
ended
completely
because
it
truly
is
a
sunny
brew
bright
lemonyellow
and
hazy
the
hocus
pocus
is
only
lightly
carbonated
a
powerful
aroma
of
white
wine
and
baked
beans
dominates
the
nose
and
imparts
a
refreshing
flavor
not
too
wet
not
too
dry
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
bit
watery
still
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
light
meal
say
a
goat
cheese
salad
or
enjoy
as
an
evening
drink
while
dinner
is
on
the
grill
overall
a
disappointment
from
this
in
general
good
brewery
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
but
a
lack
of
taste
and
a
bit
of
dryness
keep
me
from
wanting
more
wouldnt
be
bad
for
a
hot
summer
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
magic
hat
could
do
better
by
replacing
this
with
batch
374
375
or
something
else
for
next
year
a
crisp
summer
beer
you
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
but
i
like
a
bit
more
flavor
in
mine
hocus
pocus
besides
being
undoubtedly
the
best
song
by
focus
is
a
good
crisp
summer
brew
with
a
twinge
of
lemon
how
can
you
argue
with
a
beer
like
this
on
a
hot
day
loses
some
style
points
because
it
looks
a
bit
too
clear
for
a
wheat
beer
mediumlight
body
average
carbonation
pretty
well
balanced
seems
pretty
typical
of
the
style
nothing
really
stands
out
crisp
refreshing
decent
summer
wheat
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
overall
next
time
i
want
something
that
isnt
too
anything
ill
reach
for
this
its
light
crisp
balanced
and
extremely
drinkable
very
nice
warm
weather
beer
comments
i
liked
this
when
looking
for
something
cold
light
refreshing
not
overly
complex
or
remarkable
in
terms
of
flavor
but
average
overall
a
nice
refreshing
beer
that
has
some
good
flavors
and
depth
while
still
being
light
and
crisp
for
hot
days
or
people
that
dont
like
bighoppystrong
beers
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
a
slightly
bready
aroma
with
a
hint
of
citrus
to
it
an
average
american
wheat
with
subtle
lemon
highlights
a
thin
body
contributes
to
this
summer
brews
drinkabilty
something
that
i
wouldnt
care
too
much
for
unless
i
was
really
thirsty
an
all
right
beer
just
not
great
smell
was
grass
citrus
and
hops
and
not
deceivingly
as
so
was
taste
fairly
light
and
refreshing
and
in
the
fashion
of
hot
day
beers
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
there
was
enough
hop
to
it
that
i
might
reccomend
it
as
a
begginers
ipa
my
favorite
offering
from
the
magic
hat
bunch
so
far
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
but
its
not
bad
for
something
light
and
refreshing
magic
hat
is
all
over
the
map
with
respect
to
quality
beer
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
they
take
chances
and
that
sometimes
that
means
missing
the
target
but
i
wouldnt
think
it
would
be
too
difficult
to
brew
a
good
apwa
hocus
pocus
could
use
a
little
bit
of
magic
because
there
aint
no
rabbit
in
the
hat
this
time
subjectivity
not
magic
hats
best
very
light
but
not
unique
at
all
im
saying
that
more
and
more
about
american
pale
wheat
ales
a
nice
brew
goes
good
with
the
grill
warming
up
outside
and
went
well
with
the
food
nothing
overpowering
in
the
beer
good
but
not
great
pours
a
medium
hazy
strawhoney
color
with
a
thin
sudsy
white
cap
aroma
is
wheat
biscuit
citrus
and
a
hint
of
maltiness
flavor
was
a
little
honeymaltiness
up
front
with
some
sour
wheat
and
citrus
coming
out
in
the
background
flavor
was
subdued
and
on
the
watery
side
making
it
a
great
quaffing
lawnmower
wheat
ale
but
thats
about
it
took
out
the
six
pack
i
bought
but
have
had
other
more
flavorful
beers
in
this
style
poured
a
slightly

with

of
the

from

i
dont

this
beer
is
meant
to
be
as
heavy
on
the
flavor
anyway
increasingly
copper
aroma
is
a
little
distracting
after
a

definitely
drinkable
but
nothing
exciting

nothing

what
it

not

at

just
not

a
tasty
beer
for
sure
but
not
my
first
choice
in
the
wheat
ale
department
dont
mock
a
soul
hunderds
of
years
old
cheers
i
like
magic
hat
but
this
didnt
seem
the
match
up
to
some
of
the
other
magic
hat
brews
i
have
had
to
date
a
decent
beer
for
the
summer
but
not
outstanding
the
head
was
small
and
very
quick
to
disappear
very
faint
lacing
left
behind
lemon
and
maybe
some
other
citrus
come
to
the
nose
along
with
a
slight
yeast
smell
fairly
clean
taste
with
a
bit
of
hops
thrown
in
there
less
carbonation
than
one
would
expect
but
i
think
that
helped
this
one
give
it
a
try
but
im
not
promising
anything
a
decent
thing
so
far
from
legendary
go
for
it
on
a
hot
day
with
that
lower
abv
you
could
stand
to
have
a
few
in
a
row
and
hardly
feel
it
not
a
mindblower
just
a
good
simple
beer
that
clearly
has
a
purpose
in
hot
weather
this
beer
was
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
medium
head
aggressive
pour
it
had
a
sweet
citrusy
aroma
as
well
as
some
grain
fairly
pleasant
it
tasted
somewhat
tart
with
a
little
hoppiness
to
me
though
there
was
something
vaguely
displeasing
about
the
taste
im
not
able
to
describe
it
i
just
didnt
like
it
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
also
ill
try
other
beers
of
this
type
before
hitting
this
one
again
this
brew
is
a
hazy
yellowstraw
color
with
a
small
filmlike
head
the
aroma
is
clean
with
wheat
and
citrus
with
a
bit
of
grain
as
well
no
notable
hop
presence
in
the
smell
the
flavor
has
a
characteristic
wheat
taste
with
a
bit
of
yeast
and
some
lemon
qualities
the
brew
is
fairly
dry
with
an
abrupt
finish
theres
a
somewhat
bitter
hop
flourish
that
rounds
out
the
finish
medium
body
with
lower
than
average
carbonation
for
the
style
its
drinkable
but
not
a
standout
by
any
means
mouthfeeldrinkability
excellent
mouthfeel
high
efferfescence
but
it
disperses
and
never
gets
in
the
way
of
the
taste
the
swallow
is
slick
yet
light
and
effortless
high
marks
for
drinkability
i
wish
there
was
more
in
the
cooler
this
is
my
favorite
magic
hat
brew
to
date
d
what
can
i
say
a
good
pick
for
a
summer
beer
why
not
but
certainly
more
on
the
refined
side
of
things
not
a
bad
thing
but
this
one
does
not
shine
past
the
many
other
summer
beers
out
there
crystal
clear
and
two
shades
lighter
than
apple
juice
little
head
the
nose
has
a
touch
of
fruit
but
quite
a
bit
of
wheat
and
nothing
in
the
ways
of
typical
german
wheat
beer
esters
on
the
palate
this
one
opens
with
a
neutral
grainyness
that
morphs
into
acidic
tartness
and
then
to
a
wheat
finish
the
emphasis
here
is
on
smoothness
and
approachability
which
means
this
beer
is
not
terribly
interesting
it
actually
has
very
little
to
recommend
it
except
for
being
a
clean
crisp
refreshment
substitute
for
a
macro
lager
and
150
of
the
price
no
thanks
this
pours
a
light
yellow
straw
with
a
large
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
a
nice
citrus
aroma
thats
perfect
for
summer
the
taste
is
weak
and
watery
the
first
sip
tastes
like
citrus
and
floral
flavors
but
the
aftertaste
is
bland
and
very
watery
the
mf
is
light
with
the
flavors
not
being
very
balanced
this
really
is
nothing
but
a
average
to
below
average
summer
beer
i
would
pass
on
this
again
seems
like
a
decent
beer
to
me
albeit
plain
would
probably
be
tasty
on
a
hot
summer
evening
easy
drinking
for
sure
it
was
an
easily
drinkable
beer
because
it
was
so
light
but
scored
lower
on
the
drinkability
scale
due
to
its
taste
hocus
pocus
presents
itself
as
straw
colored
with
golden
highlights
around
the
edges
slight
white
head
of
small
densely
packed
bubbles
and
bold
carbonation
streams
the
head
quickly
thins
to
a
collar
which
leaves
some
lacing
dry
grass
crisp
hops
and
some
mild
wheat
wafts
from
the
glass
the
tongue
tingles
with
crispness
and
light
carbonation
modest
hop
bite
but
extremely
light
body
hints
of
lemon
throughout
not
a
particularly
impressive
mh
beer
12
ounce
bottle
drink
before
end
of
o
notched
sometimes
im
not
in
the
mood
for
this
and
it
bores
me
but
when
youre
looking
for
a
summer
apwa
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
more
refreshing
than
most
in
the
style
even
another
solid
magic
hat
offering
nothing
outstanding
which
is
the
styles
biggest
problem
but
its
a
nice
example
somewhat
of
a
dissappointment
when
you
consider
all
the
marketing
trouble
theyve
gone
to
in
packaging
this
beer
pours
a
drab
pale
gold
with
a
quickly
falling
head
some
islands
remain
on
the
table
and
a
few
fat
lazy
bubbles
make
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
beer
nose
is
that
astringent
offputting
boiled
grass
smell
with
a
slight
bit
of
lemon
zest
to
keep
it
from
falling
below
a
3
taste
is
slick
and
buttery
with
a
tingling
on
the
palate
but
watery
along
the
edge
of
the
tongue
the
wheat
is
noticeable
but
nothing
screams
dynamic
or
complex
here
mouthfeel
is
aided
by
the
buttery
notes
drinkable
if
you
like
this
style
im
not
real
happy
with
this
one
ill
see
if
the
spouse
will
drink
my
remaining
bottles
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
the
bottle
but
did
not
review
it
i
enjoyed
it
even
more
on
tap
and
have
notes
that
tell
me
i
really
liked
it
even
more
lemony
summer
wheat
aroma
of
grass
and
doughy
wheat
malt
a
clean
tasting
summer
refresher
that
satisfies
on
a
a
hazy
hot
and
humid
day
on
raritan
bay
this
is
a
nice
seasonal
offering
from
the
folks
in
south
burlington
the
missus
liked
it
too
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
summer
brew
a
wheat
beer
for
those
who
are
not
necessarily
sold
on
the
style
but
are
looking
for
something
light
and
refreshing
yet
different
drinks
easily
and
compliments
a
meal
well
another
good
beer
for
when
you
need
a
good
thirst
quencher
or
four
the
lemon
ringwood
esters
and
wheat
character
work
really
well
together
in
this
one
to
provide
a
unique
and
pleasantly
balanced
taste
a
hard
one
not
to
like
in
the
summer
nice
straw
color
and
refreshing
aroma
tastes
lemony
very
lemony
some
hops
a
fair
amount
of
wheat
and
a
barely
there
sourtangy
finish
not
too
complex
not
too
simple
a
tasty
mouthful
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
kind
of
foamy
very
bubbly
and
nice
extremely
light
on
the
palate
highly
drinkable
refreshing
light
tasty
and
the
sour
in
the
background
is
really
quite
lovely
this
is
brewed
as
a
summer
seasonal
and
it
suits
that
purpose
pretty
well
but
theres
not
much
magic
going
on
here
appears
as
a
yellowish
hue
clear
through
hardly
any
head
at
all
the
aromas
are
a
bit
more
promising
that
the
look
providing
a
sense
of
lemon
and
wheat
suggesting
crispness
flavors
are
mild
but
enjoyable
crisp
zingy
tiny
bit
of
bitterness
a
tiny
diacetyl
flavor
also
comes
through
overall
a
refreshing
brew
on
a
warmer
day
doesnt
knock
my
socks
off
but
isnt
disappointing
either
the
small
is
good
with
lemon
and
wheat
malt
the
taste
isnt
as
good
wheat
comes
though
but
the
flavor
is
plain
the
mouthfeel
is
reasonable
and
the
drinkability
is
decent
its
a
fairly
refreshing
beer
but
thats
about
it
poured
an
attractive
amber
color
with
moderate
head
that
feel
to
a
nice
ring
smell
is
of
a
nice
lemonycitrus
texture
taste
is
a
bit
plain
with
fruity
overtones
that
are
thirst
quenching
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
enjoyable
a
very
decent
summer
brew
tasted
071705
definitely
highly
drinkable
and
in
my
opinion
what
a
summer
seasonal
should
be
hmm
just
saw
that
this
is
a
pale
wheat
i
guess
that
explains
alot
of
the
tastes
i
found
in
it
if
its
a
wheat
why
wasnt
it
cloudy
this
is
a
fairly
average
wheat
beer
appearance
is
pretty
average
looking
like
a
typical
golden
pilsner
smell
was
yeast
like
without
much
else
coming
through
taste
also
had
an
extremely
strong
yeast
component
not
sweet
at
all
a
little
bland
but
containing
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
drinking
it
its
certainly
not
my
favorite
wheat
beer
but
its
drinkable
eh
wish
magic
hat
would
stick
their
necks
out
more
with
their
offerings
as
i
just
find
them
runofthemill
for
the
most
part
and
this
one
is
no
different
i
like
my
light
colored
summer
seasonals
and
i
do
not
like
this
one
this
beer
reminds
me
of
what
many
brewpubs
create
to
appease
bud
drinkers
it
is
a
waste
of
time
strong
honey
smell
and
taste
added
to
a
very
thin
lite
lager
magic
hat
can
do
much
better
than
this
although
i
applaud
them
for
trying
to
fill
the
pollenator
void
other
smell
and
taste
notes
are
citrus
grass
more
honey
very
slight
malt
i
think
this
might
be
better
when
it
is
really
hot
outside
its
not
too
hot
here
right
now
note
reviewed
in
late
june
2005
pours
a
pretty
clear
yellow
color
with
little
to
no
head
smell
is
fruity
like
apricots
with
a
hint
of
wheat
much
like
other
summer
offerings
the
taste
is
pretty
fruity
as
well
with
a
terrific
finish
definitely
a
beer
that
is
made
for
the
summer
and
will
keep
you
happy
all
summer
long
this
is
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
wheat
ale
magic
hat
has
made
another
fantastic
ale
this
ale
is
very
light
and
has
quite
a
bit
of
citrus
flavorings
drank
this
ber
at
a
very
hot
and
very
sunny
old
dom
brewery
festival
and
it
was
great
perfect
beer
for
those
outside
relaxing
hot
days
very
little
head
and
what
was
there
left
fairly
quickly
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
and
since
its
so
drinkable
ill
be
enjoying
a
few
more
this
will
be
up
near
the
top
on
my
list
this
summer
this
is
a
summer
pounder
too
good
to
be
called
a
lawnmower
beer
but
i
would
have
like
the
flavors
a
little
more
pronounced
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
this
just
about
covers
the
taste
too
the
taste
is
refreshing
i
e
pretty
thirst
quenching
with
the
aroma
and
taste
of
wheat
and
lemon
dominate
although
i
do
detect
some
honey
flavor
and
hop
floralness
this
beer
starts
off
better
than
it
finishes
it
is
not
suprisingly
a
little
bit
tart
and
a
little
bit
dry
but
as
the
beer
warmed
i
detected
a
slight
not
completely
pleasant
bitter
flavor
this
aside
it
is
not
a
bad
offering
from
magic
hat
just
not
one
of
their
best
if
you
want
a
beer
for
relief
from
the
heat
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
that
to
try
hocus
pocus
that
said
if
you
happen
to
still
have
a
bottle
of
the
nolongerbeingmade
pollinator
from
long
trail
well
i
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
great
review
but
this
beer
is
too
damn
dry
not
as
refreshing
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
it
pours
a
hazy
yellow
orange
with
an
allright
head
the
head
was
fruity
the
taste
is
allright
but
not
as
wheaty
as
i
would
have
expected
as
stated
before
too
damn
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
light
not
as
drinkable
as
i
would
haev
thought
but
not
bad
drinkability
this
was
one
of
the
more
refreshing
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
i
could
easily
have
tossed
back
several
of
these
at
a
time
if
i
hadnt
shown
some
restraint
another
quality
brew
from
a
quality
brewery
definitely
worth
a
try
taste
was
also
rather
bland
rather
fruitty
upfront
and
also
very
wattery
taste
and
mouthfell
were
very
thin
and
som
malt
flavor
could
be
detected
ample
carbonation
fed
the
head
but
overall
this
beer
was
nothing
special
better
than
sa
summer
offering
but
still
did
not
do
it
for
me
its
ok
dog
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
special
very
unimpressed
a
pretty
damn
approachable
basic
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
light
and
drinkable
nice
for
a
hot
summer
day
the
tartness
of
this
brew
gets
to
my
tastebuds
a
little
and
would
prevent
me
from
having
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
served
a
hazy
wheaty
brewskie
color
with
a
white
headskie
ive
sampled
quite
a
few
wheat
beers
lately
and
i
must
say
that
magic
hats
old
classic
hocus
pocus
is
one
of
my
favorites
nice
and
clean
with
great
mouthfeel
and
high
drinkability
worth
checking
out
on
draft
around
town
even
if
its
out
a
bit
early
recomended
this
appeared
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
orange
in
the
glad
with
about
an
inch
of
white
foam
some
lace
was
left
but
the
head
dropped
out
of
sight
quickly
aroma
was
a
bit
off
with
citric
hops
standing
out
over
a
sweet
malt
there
were
notes
of
lemon
and
grain
but
overall
the
smell
was
a
bit
weak
the
taste
starts
off
wheaty
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
a
slight
odd
taste
in
there
i
couldnt
identify
body
is
a
bit
light
but
it
is
sufficient
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
rather
boring
one
for
me
with
a
little
more
work
this
could
definitely
be
a
good
beer
overall
a
solid
beer
one
that
i
will
try
again
next
summer
as
a
summer
quincher
i
would
say
a
great
summer
brew
light
bodied
and
dry
a
bit
tart
good
summery
session

this

the

from

i
must
say
that
i
was
very
pleased
with
it

it

do
know
how
to
brew
beer
here
in

an
odd
combination
of
citrus
wheat
and
something
else
that
i
couldnt
identify
but
it
just
wasnt
very
appealling
taste
was
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
slight
wheat
flavors
not
having
much
of
a
shot
to
be
enjoyed
before
the
lemonunknown
flavor
took
over
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
quite
low
i
had
trouble
finishing
this
one
and
not
too
sure
why
i
did
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
at
the
start
and
finished
quickly
with
a
shortly
lasting
lemon
tone
this
is
lighter
in
body
and
almost
thin
the
tastebuds
wanted
some
more
flavor
so
drinkability
is
down
a
notch
even
though
this
is
a
hot
sun
lawn
mowing
type
brew
this
is
a
classic
american
wheat
ale
and
well
suited
for
the
hot
months
crisp
and
clean
nice
summer
session
brew
12
ounce
bottle
freshness
dating
notched
in
to
the
label
pours
medium
amber
and
cloudy
white
head
nice
and
tiny
bubble
style
leaves
better
then
average
amounts
of
lacing
nose
of
wheat
and
floral
hops
medium
bodied
brew
fairly
dull
flavor
profile
soft
malts
and
slightly
drying
hoppy
finish
ehh
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
here
just
a
fairly
pleasing
light
ale
decent
for
the
summer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
small
foamy
head
smells
of
a
hint
of
lemon
the
taste
is
like
a
pale
ale
that
is
a
little
bitter
with
a
little
lemon
i
found
this
to
be
a
great
summer
beer
one
that
is
best
served
as
cold
as
possible
especially
when
you
have
a
thirst
to
quench
this
is
a
light
bodied
refreshing
brew
for
a
hot
summers
day
well
the
verdict
is
in
i
just
simply
do
not
like
wheat
beers
an
average
brew
from
magic
hat
at
best
this
will
probably
be
the
last
wheat
beer
i
ever
purchase
i
enjoy
magic
hat
brews
so
i
figured
i
would
give
this
one
a
try
i
wasnt
sure
what
kind
of
brew
it
was
when
i
bought
it
but
it
appeared
to
be
a
pale
ale
and
one
sip
is
all
you
need
to
taste
that
wheat
very
smooth
taste
hops
are
present
but
not
overwhelming
like
in
other
pale
ales
probably
the
best
magic
hat
brew
ive
tried
to
date
very
drinkable
average
abv
you
cant
taste
the
wheat
malt
and
if
you
want
a
pale
slightly
hoppy
session
beer
try
their
mother
lager
which
is
much
better
imho
tastes
like
pot
pourri
way
too
much
hops
for
my
liking
once
you
get
past
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
you
are
greeted
by
even
more
hops
im
not
a
fan
drank
in
between
a
le
fin
du
monde
and
an
allagash
bruin
this
beer
doesnt
even
stand
in
the
same
league
as
those
two
very
weak
mouth
feel
i
dont
think
i
will
be
having
another
disappointing
since
i
enjoy
9
and
their
other
offerings
perhaps
just
this
keg
summer
beers
should
be
much
more
enjoyable
this
is
good
beer
that
doesnt
fit
any
category
well
that
said
an
open
mind
will
make
this
an
enjoyable
and
unique
treat
although
the
aroma
detracts
if
you
want
a
high
quality
wheat
or
pale
ale
this
wont
fit
the
classic
definition
of
either
and
therefore
will
be
a
disappointment
drinkability

i
actually
sent
back
beer
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
at
the
tribeca
grand
in
nyc
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
beer
that
will
live
on
in
the
annals
of
your
taste
buds
either
has
a
decent
appearance
a
bit
of
a
sour
smell
but
i
wont
hold
that
against
it
the
taste
is
extra
mediocre
a
bit
bland
with
some
hops
and
a
hint
of
a
flavor
that
weirdly
reminds
me
of
lime
juice
a
little
on
the
watery
side
the
carbonation
level
is
about
right
but
i
just
cant
excited
enough
about
this
one
to
come
back
too
many
times
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
fruity
wheat
scent
with
a
dry
yet
sweet
honey
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
and
refreshing
wheat
flavor
that
goes
down
really
easy
it
has
a
fruity
finish
a
very
light
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
wheat
beer
but
it
is
still
a
good
drinker
it
is
quite
refreshing
a
good
hot
weather
beer
eh
wasnt
too
impressed
summer
ale
with
a
very
citric
taste
lemon
and
orange
maybe
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
summer
ale
but
not
as
drinkable
dont
get
me
wrong
decent
beer
but
you
have
to
have
the
taste
for
it
which
i
dont
citrus
beers
are
starting
to
get
on
my
bad
side
probably
not
something
ill
buy
again
very
clear
light
light
gold
with
sticky
white
head
decent
retention
funky
ringwood
aroma
with
a
honey
dirtiness
to
it
very
intriguing
i
like
it
flavor
is
very
dry
with
some
astringency
very
bland
flavors
of
spiciness
that
leave
my
mouth
tingling
a
bit
the
carbonation
is
medium
but
combined
with
the
taste
it
becomes
harsh
not
a
very
i
need
to
stop
saying
very
good
beer
i
hope
not
to
have
it
again
a
dark
golden
colour
with
a
small
head
of
white
foam
that
does
not
last
long
the
aromas
are
wheaty
and
citruslike
with
that
funkyfruity
yeast
strain
of
theirs
ringwood
in
the
mix
as
well
the
taste
is
very
citruslike
and
wheaty
with
a
nice
fruity
balance
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
drinkability
is
good
a
good
if
uncomplex
american
wheat
beer
definately
a
good
summer
pick
to
be
honest
with
you
hocus
pocus
really
didnt
knock
my
socks
off
sure
its
good
but
to
me
this
is
just
average
poured
out
a
golden
color
with
little
carbonation
aroma
of
some
wheat
malts
and
some
lemon
pop
up
taste
was
actually
a
little
smooth
and
creamy
with
some
hop
bite
at
the
end
but
wasnt
very
impressive
at
all
finishes
quite
dry
granted
in
the
summer
time
i
wouldnt
mind
buying
a
6pack
once
in
a
while
but
i
would
rather
go
for
something
else
this
beer
is
a
little
overpriced
imo
this
oddlynamed
ale
pours
cremey
cloudy
and
medium
maber
with
a
white
head
its
aroma
resembles
sugar
or
spring
air
with
a
gentle
suggestion
of
citrus
it
starts
witha
bit
of
subtle
bitterness
over
an
acidic
twinge
hp
is
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
bitter
hops
flavor
over
some
caramel
foundations
its
finish
is
very
bitter
and
dry
and
manages
to
leave
the
mouth
eager
for
another
taste
of
ale
hocus
pocus
has
made
my
magic
hat
experiance
3
for
3
keep
it
coming
magic
hat
brews
usually
hit
big
or
miss
big
with
me
and
this
one
misses
i
give
them
a
bit
of
credit
for
trying
to
do
something
interesting
with
a
light
bodied
beer
but
it
doesnt
work
for
me
this
could
be
a
decent
summer
brew
but
thats
about
it
chillhazed
amber
with
nary
but
a
halolike
trace
of
a
head
sweetish
barley
aroma
with
a
hint
of
leafy
hops
this
aroma
is
surprisingy
invigorating
and
fresh
smelling
the
flavor
starts
with
a
mildly
sweet
malt
but
is
very
wellbalanced
by
just
a
hint
of
graininess
and
a
subtle
pineyleafy
hop
finish
very
clean
and
poppy
though
the
sweetness
starts
to
come
through
a
bit
too
much
as
the
beer
warms
partly
due
to
undercarbonation
overall
though
this
is
definitely
a
good
wholesome
vermont
beer
makes
me
feel
like
raising
a
barn
with
some
amish
folk
except
thats
pennsylvania
and
i
guess
the
amish
dont
drink
or
do
they
ah
well
you
get
my
drift
this
beer
poured
out
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
and
was
topped
with
a
small
white
head
that
thinned
out
fast
an
interesting
and
lively
aroma

sweet
honey
citrus
and
floral
tones
prominent
are
fresh
berries
and
grapefruit
beer
has
a
pleasant
bitterness
and
a
biting
dryness
to
it
body
is
medium
to
light
and
finishes
with
leaving
an
orange
taste
in
the
mouth
this
has
a
lot
going
for
it

plenty
of
complex
flavors
a
perfect
balance
between
dry
and
sweet
and
most
important
a
very
high
drinkability
a
very
fine
beer
better
than
the
fat
angel
but
not
quite
up
there
with
magic
hats
best
offerings
seems
to
be
the
lemon
version
of
9
a
refreshing
light
beer
good
for
summer
but
not
one
of
my
personal
favorites
overall
this
is
a
solid
summer
wheat
appears
a
vibrant
glowing
golden
orangish
tone
with
a
nice
sized
cream
colored
head
leaving
full
patches
of
lacing
in
rings
down
my
pint
aroma
fruit
tones
wrapped
in
pleasant
floral
hops
slight
citrus
twang
to
it
very
clean
smell
to
it
no
offness
to
be
detected
enough
bready
yeast
and
malt
notes
to
blend
together
in
harmony
flavor
is
a
spritzy
rush
of
citrus
i
wanna
say
lemon
sweetness
no
sourness
here
just
the
tone
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
the
malts
playing
second
fiddle
to
the
party
and
a
welcoming
bitterness
also
exists
in
this
great
summer
brew
quite
the
experience
in
a
bottle
mouthfeel
has
a
healthy
carbonation
not
cloying
in
anyway
with
some
texture
in
the
form
of
watered
down
syrup
not
bad
at
all
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
this
bottle
is
wearing
on
me
i
dont
know
if
i
could
consume
this
in
mass
quantity
overall
a
very
drinkable
summerstyle
beer
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
the
tartsour
characteristic
began
to
somewhat
take
over
any
other
flavors
a
usual
difficult
to
classify
magic
hat
offering
i
basically
liked
all
their
beers
i
have
tried
thus
far
but
they
are
kind
of
goofy
definitely
pale
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
very
fruity
aroma
with
a
decent
hop
note
buttery
bitter
taste
that
leaves
me
working
my
jaws
like
a
dog
licking
peanut
butter
the
bitterness
reminds
me
a
bit
of
an
old
vegetable
maybe
asparagus
that
grew
too
long
in
dry
conditions
mouthfeel
is
harsh
carbonation
accompanied
by
a
sugary
coating
that
just
keeps
clinging
to
your
teeth
and
tongue
there
is
a
solid
malt
backgorund
but
theres
way
too
much
funkiness
going
on
here
drinkability
isnt
bad
but
im
glad
i
didnt
pour
a
double
of
this
hocus
pocus
please
make
it
disappear
taste
very
crisp
and
refreshing
solid
yet
light
mouthfeel
initial
sweet
malt
lemony
citrus
and
a
slight
honey
tinge
the
ringwood
works
with
this
beer
instead
of
against
it
as
in
most
imho
nicely
clean
and
just
dry
enough
in
the
finish
pours
a
medium
amber
color
darker
than
i
expected
with
an
impressively
thick
white
head
aroma
is
also
surprisingly
hoppy
much
more
assertive
than
i
anticipated
definite
lemony
wheaty
scent
dry
and
a
touch
hoppy
citric
the
hops
and
lemon
flavors
work
very
very
well
together
flavor
is
much
less
hoppy
than
the
aroma
would
indicate
although
hops
come
through
somewhat
in
the
middle
and
finish
lightly
in
the
end
providing
a
very
pleasant
clean
dry
finish
when
coupled
with
the
wheat
malt
very
very
slight
clove
taste
flavor
is
mostly
crisp
and
dry
wheatiness
with
little
in
the
way
of
esters
body
is
light
carbonation
is
definitely
active
while
i
wouldnt
really
like
this
any
other
time
of
the
year
this
is
definitely
lawnmowing
beer
not
bad
better
than
i
expected
its
no
german
hefe
but
it
did
the
trick
today
medium
amber
in
color
with
pure
white
head
that
lingers
to
the
bottom
toasted
malt
smells
with
some
lemon
in
there
too
possibly
a
little
hops
im
not
sure
balanced
taste
with
some
lemon
to
finish
appropriately
light
mouthfeel
not
watery
though
i
wouldnt
really
change
anything
about
this
aspect
of
it
this
is
good
for
what
it
is
a
summer
beer
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
in
beer
all
the
time
but
it
has
its
place
and
is
good
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonals
a
hazy
yellow
gold
body
is
capped
by
a
decentsized
lid
of
bright
white
foam
and
although
it
drops
within
a
relatively
short
period
it
does
maintain
a
very
nice
creamy
surface
covering
and
leaves
continuous
rings
of
spotty
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
displays
the
typical
ringwood
yeast
nose
and
a
touch
of
wheatish
malt
thats
mildly
lemonish
the
body
is
light
as
a
summer
beer
should
be
and
the
very
fine
carbonation
gently
caresses
the
tongue
as
it
slides
across
the
palate
in
the
flavor
a
delicate
wheatbased
malt
is
gently
tangy
and
a
touch
citrusy
and
floral
backed
by
a
supportive
hop
bitterness
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
the
exception
of
some
lingering
yeast
character
and
a
mild
touch
of
hops
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
grows
on
you
and
although
it
may
seem
very
basic
at
first
it
actually
has
enough
going
on
to
keep
it
interesting
throughout
a
few
well
done
up
front
the
taste
is
biscuity
raw
grains
lemons
light
acidity
it
is
crisp
tart
finishes
with
a
mouth
puckering
bitterness
including
notes
of
pine
apples
and
citrus
very
hoppy
for
a
wheat
beer
overall
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
when
it
comes
to
summery
brews
it
seemed
to
be
more
of
an
ipa
with
fruit
flavors
than
just
your
normal
summer
brew
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
probably
my
favourite
summer
brew
pours
a
light
healthy
yellow
gold
as
opposed
to
a
coronabudesque
piss
yellow
with
a
moderate
head
smells
of
lemon
and
tastes
echo
the
smell
with
a
bit
of
honey
as
well
an
excellent
summer
ale
with
a
bit
more
body
and
bite
to
it
than
say
a
sam
adams
summer
ale
a
great
thirst
quencher
on
a
summer
day
and
just
an
excellent
beer
overall
another
winner
from
magic
hat
poured
a
bright
gold
color
with
slowly
rising
carbonation
and
a
pure
white
head
head
had
low
retention
but
very
good
lacing
aroma
was
flat
and
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
rather
interesting
very
soft
on
the
tongue
finishing
with
a
slight
bitterness
a
great
summer
beer
and
judging
by
the
taste
i
think
this
would
pair
beautifully
with
seafood
dishes
especially
shellfish
interestingly
enough
i
noticed
the
same
quality
with
mhs
single
chair
and
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
am
wondering
if
those
two
brews
are
actually
the
same
brew
lol
im
going
to
have
to
come
back
to
this
one
because
im
a
bit
stuffed
up
but
im
not
all
that
impressed
by
this
offering
from
magic
hat
it
certainly
is
unlike
anything
else
ive
had
but
there
was
too
much
out
of
place
diacetyl
imo
im
probably
missing
something
because
of
my
congestion
so
ill
shut
up
now
i
was
able
to
try
this
once
while
living
up
therepoured
a
nice
orangegold
color
with
lemon
zest
smell
to
it
very
balanced
alemalt
was
the
backbone
to
this
with
a
grainy
fruity
ending
to
this
would
be
good
in
summeri
think
real
good
down
here
where
the
summers
are
stifling
this
ale
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
creamy
bright
white
foam
head
the
smell
was
good
and
strong
very
biscuity
with
a
grain
aroma
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
and
aromatics
the
taste
was
very
smooth
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
low
hop
character
kind
of
hard
to
describe
but
reminiscent
of
a
german
dunkel
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
mellow
very
pleasant
slightly
sweet
medium
light
bodied
but
with
a
crisp
finish
i
found
this
ale
to
be
very
drinkable
but
difficult
to
categorize
not
surprising
with
a
magic
hat
beer
in
any
event
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
it
went
down
easy
hazy
light
straw
color
some
small
yeast
chunks
are
suspended
the
nose
is
grassy
wheat
and
lemony
light
grain
breadiness
shifts
to
tart
then
fruity
white
grape
and
pear
not
stellar
but
a
decent
thirst
quenching
summer
wheat
overall
a
pretty
good
wheat
beer
though
maybe
a
bit
lighter
and
thinner
than
i
expected
light
and
smooth
with
a
somewhat
strange
flavor
it
says
it
is
a
mix
of
3
other
magic
hat
brews
humble
patience
blind
faith
and
chaotic
chemistry
this
funky
little
mix
goes
down
great
golden
body
much
effervescence
big
white
head
rapidly
collapsing
burst
of
fresh
hay
uncapping
bottle
not
much
nose
out
of
glass
at
all
barley
and

wish
they
sold
it
here
in

ohio
was
brought
some
from
vermont
a
month
ago
one
of
my
staples
when
im
back
that
way
to
visit
family
nice
light
wheat
hefe
overall
more
hefeweizen
than
pale
ale
nice
bavarian
yeast
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
and
great
taste
a
solid
wheat
beer
easy
drinkability
pretty
good
depth
for
a
beer
that
is
also
pretty
easy
to
find
one
of
my
favorites
harpoon
offerings
excellent
hefeweizen
beer
and
wonderful
flavors
nice
and
light
and
highly
drinkable
overall
a
solid
offering
but
not
my
stlyle
0612
rate
beer
does
not
do
this
brew
justice
a
26
time
for
me
to
reevaluate
rb
its
got
a
fresh
clean
taste
with
a
great
balance
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
lemon
takes
it
into
julyaugust
mode
overall
this
one
should
not
be
labeled
a
hefeweizen
i
know
ba
categorizes
it
as
an
american
pale
wheat
and
that
is
certainly
what
it
is
but
harpoon
calling
this
one
a
hefeweizen
is
a
shame
this
beer
is
abysmal
as
a
hefeweizen
and
passable
as
an
american
pale
wheat
but
even
then
it
pales
in
comparison
to
better
offerings
including
goose
island
312
and
bells
oberon
taste
is
light
on
the
palate
grainy
and
almost
lagerlike
i
get
little
trace
of
any
clove
or
banana
or
bubblegum
notes
as
id
expect
instead
i
would
consider
this
more
of
a
basic
wheat
beer
as
a
hefeweizen
this
one
just
falls
short
on
most
levels
nonetheless
this
remains
drinkable
and
easygoing
and
would
make
a
a
solid
session
drink
or
a
fine
starter
beer
for
future
craft
beer
fans
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
has
only
fairly
faint
wheat
notes
the
body
is
slightly
heartier
than
most
wheats
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
but
there
is
a
something
sweet
on
the
finish
as
well
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
most
wheat
beers
and
this
was
no
different
not
offensive
was
certainly
drinkable
just
very
very
low
on
taste
ive
certainly
had
worse
but
i
wont
buy
this
again
overall
this
example
is
way
below
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
both
german
and
american
brewers
of
this
style
such
as
paulanders
hefeweizen
amd
sierra
nevadas
kellerweis
hefeweizen
taste
has
a
good
bit
of
tart
raspberry
in
it
and
is
quite
pleasant
the
wheat
taste
is
nice
and
crisp
the
tartness
is
much
more
than
what
the
smell
would
suggest
mouthfeel
is
alright
and
drinkability
is
good
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
bbq
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
has
a
strong
wheat
smell
some
malt
and
spice
sweet
and
citrus
taste
has
the
spice
up
front
with
the
citrus
at
the
end
strong
on
the
palette
nice
flavors
balanced
nicely
overall
a
nice
beer
could
be
a
bit
smoother
but
an
enjoyable
beer
o
this
is
a
solid
hefe
nothing
stands
out
as
best
in
class
but
its
very
drinkable
and
serves
as
a
great
refreshing
brew
on
a
warm
afternoon
i
recommend
drinking
this
outside
as
much
as
possible
o
quite
onedimensional
but
a
nice
pale
wheat
ale
very
wheatcentered
with
fruity
yeast
and
very
light
spice
extremely
drinkable
as
well
purchased
only
one
bottle
and
that
was
enough
o
overall
not
my
favorite
pale
wheat
or
beer
from
harpoon
but
decent
nose
was
pretty
nice
but
the
taste
had
a
little
too
much
pepper
or
spice
in
it
probably
would
just
stick
with
their
ipa
next
time
this
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
yeast
adds
some
bubblegum
and
banana
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
is
rather
flavorless
its
also
a
bit
grainy
which
detracts
from
the
overall
flavor
i
definitely
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
there
are
far
better
beers
out
there
that
are
actual
hefeweizens
overall
enjoyable
beer
cannot
complain
cant
really
think
of
any
improvment
though
o
this
beer
is
alright
it
has
the
skeleton
of
a
pale
wheat
ale
but
nothing
really
stands
out
its
also
far
too
plain
and
light
for
my
taste
the
mouthfeel
lacks
that
creaminess
that
good
wheat
ales
possess
i
know
that
its
only
semantics
but
harpoon
has
no
business
calling
this
a
hefeweizen
american
pale
wheat
ales
should
not
have
the
clove
and
banana
aromas
or
flavors
that
good
german
hefeweizens
have
so
its
not
fair
to
put
them
in
the
same
category
also
if
they
were
trying
to
make
a
hefeweizen
instead
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
they
failed
miserably
this
is
a
decent
beer
especially
for
the
summer
but
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
overall
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
wheat
beer
to
me
the
flavours
are
way
too
subtle
either
way
its
pretty
boring
and
i
wouldnt
pick
this
up
again
i
suppose
i
like
my
hefeweizens
to
have
some
taste
to
them
a
little
clove
or
banana
esters
would
have
been
nice
with
this
one
its
a
decent
beer
for
warm
weather
but
its
too
tasteless
for
my
liking
personally
i
dont
like
this
trend
in
commercial
beers
of
brewing
hefeweizens
without
the
estery
goodness
i
see
that
one
of
the
bros
reviewed
this
in
2001
and
he
said
it
was
one
of
the
best
examples
of
an
american
wheat
the
recipe
must
have
changed
from
11
years
ago
this
is
not
a
good
representation
of
a
hefeweizen
and
should
be
avoided
if
you
want
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
the
style
id
have
this
again
i
believe
this
is
a
well
done
rendition
of
a
hefeweizen
and
something
i
would
purchase
again
a
tad
pricey
though
this
beer
pours
up
with
an
enormous
head
with
lots
of
lacing
color
is
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
strong
smell
of
wheat
mouthfeel
is
a
pretty
thin
and
the
taste
is
uncomplex
with
a
little
bit
of
hoppiness
not
bad
but
nothing
extraspecial
here
either
o
yeah
id
drink
again
on
a
hot
summer
texas
day
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
it
drinks
very
fast
due
to
the
lack
of
flavors
blue
moon
has
more
of
a
wheat
taste
o
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
to
have
more
than
one
of
because
it
is
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
has
some
thirstquenching
properties
overall
this
is
a
nice
unfiltered
beer
i
enjoy
shiners
verison
more
but
they
dont
do
the
cloudy
goodness
like
this
one
harpoon
again
delivers
another
solid
beer
the
ufo
hefeweizen
is
a
solid
hefeweizen
with
good
flavor
the
unfiltered
hefeweizen
gives
it
the
smooth
yet
unique
flavor
that
ufo
beers
provide
again
i
enjoy
drinking
this
during
the
summer
while
grilling
out
it
is
light
enough
that
you
can
just
enjoy
the
smooth
flavor
with
just
about
any
dish
in
the
summer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
glass
the
beer
is
a
pale
unfiltered
hazy
yellowish
coloring
with
a
frothy
light
foamy
white
head
that
starts
strong
but
settles
into
a
bubbly
film
signs
of
strong
carbonation
throughout
the
beers
body
and
nothing
left
along
the
glass
as
you
go
aromas
of
bread
clove
banana
and
some
light
peppering
the
beers
flavors
are
mild
and
the
body
is
smooth
but
slightly
sharp
at
the
end
from
the
carbonation
palate
of
slight
citrus
highlights
along
the
banana
bread
backbone
with
some
spicy
notes
throughout
the
keep
it
clean
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
spicing
and
again
its
a
bit
sharp
from
the
effervescent
and
carbonated
body
the
finish
is
quick
and
clean
easy
enough
to
drink
thats
for
sure
overall
slightly
below
average
american
pale
wheat
ale
not
really
distinguishable
or
memorable
a
beer
not
so
bad
that
i
would
turn
it
away
but
there
are
plenty
others
in
the
style
i
would
go
to
first
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
1
finger
head
and
lasting
lace
the
aroma
is
of
banana
dough
and
vanilla
the
flavor
is
subdued
banana
and
mild
lemon
with
a
cake
background
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
smooth
harpoon
ufo
hefeweizen
is
a
good
beer
recommended
rjt
this
beer
tastes
like
a
sweet
malt
liquor
and
is
really
crappy
most
any
beer
is
better
than
this
unless
its
a
malt
liquor
overall
its
lacking
a
lot
of
flavor
either
because
my
bottle
is
old
or
this
beer
is
just
very
simple
overall
the
light
tastes
that
are
there
and
are
palatable
make
this
beer
effortless
because
once
its
sitting
in
your
mouth
its
going
down
easy
and
quick
overall
a
decent
wheat
beer
i
would
have
this
one
again
it
could
be
offered
to
a
person
who
is
new
to
craft
beer
without
overwhelming
their
tastebuds
o
very
drinkable
and
light
i
would
have
another
havent
had
harpoon
in
quite
awhile
so
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
i
really
like
the
label
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
nice
fluffy
head
and
inviting
citrus
aroma
nice
wheat
flavor
with
not
much
hops
tiny
bit
of
banana
clove
which
may
be
more
noticeable
in
a
fresher
bottle
nice
light
clean
taste
which
was
very
easy
to
drink
would
enjoy
a
sixer
in
the
summer
oa
run
of
the
mill
apwa
could
use
some
more
hops
but
a
easy
drinker
and
rather
sessionable
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
good
overall
but
much
better
hefes
available
so
not
something
im
likely
to
go
back
to
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
has
its
problems
but
its
a
solid
brew
not
really
a
bad
beer
just
not
the
best
hefe
out
there
it
pours
a
light
murky
orange
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
mostly
and
surprisingly
caramel
and
butter
with
just
a
hint
of
citrus
and
wheat
the
taste
is
mostly
lemon
and
wheat
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
the
beer
is
light
with
lots
of
prickly
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
hefe
better
than
the
ufo
white
at
least
final
thoughts
a
very
fine
beer
not
the
best
but
a
great
whack
at
hefes
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
them
and
i
can
tell
you
this
is
a
pretty
good
whack
at
the
style
nice
yeastiness
which
i
am
a
fan
of
not
the
best
ever
but
a
good
one
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
lasting
white
head
a
faint
and
quickly
vanishing
aroma
of
sweet
ripe
fruit
and
some
light
banana
notes
taste
is
wheat
some
maltiness
very
faint
fruity
notes
but
mostly
a
wheat
flavor
light
body
and
ok
carbonation
and
watery
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
light
malt
wheat
some
light
sweet
spices
ending
is
mostly
wheat
with
some
grassy
notes
overall
an
ok
yet
refreshing
light
summer
brew
there
are
better
hefes
out
there
it
had
a
murky
yelloworange
color
with
a
small
head
little
lacing
very
strong
lemon
and
citrus
taste
too
strong
in
my
opinion
but
it
might
be
enjoyable
by
those
looking
for
strong
spicy
flavors
in
their
hefes
refreshing
mouthfeel
special
for
a
hot
summer
day
m
great
bubbly
feel
to
this
and
it
went
down
great
and
i
felt
it
the
whole
way
which
i
like
awesome
aftertaste
too
overall
a
good
brew
seems
a
little
lighter
than
some
other
hefes
but
they
are
very
easy
to
drink
yet
still
has
enough
kick
from
the
wheat
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
special
serving
type
bottle
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
rich
enough
on
the
whole
a
pretty
average
beer
not
bad
for
accompanying
food
better
without
the
chilled
glass
though
poured
a
1
white
head
hazy
lemon
yellow
color
slight
smell
of
spice
very
little
in
the
taste
beyond
standard
bmcs
in
fact
quite
watery
had
i
not
known
this
was
a
hefe
i
might
have
missed
those
attributes
entirely
still
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
nice
cold
refreshment
on
a
summer
day
overalli
just
let
this
beer
sit
in
the
heat
for
about
20
minutes
after
drinking
about
6oz
and
ended
up
pouring
it
out
stay
away
from
this
horseshit
beer
the
beer
had
a
great
appearance
at
first
with
a
nice
head
and
color
the
taste
was
just
bland
and
almost
too
watery
nothing
about
the
smell
taste
or
mouthfeel
stood
out
lacking
in
carbonation
mouthfeel
was
too
light
taste
for
a
split
second
was
typical
of
the
style
but
it
would
quickly
disappear
and
taste
like
a
watered
down
hefe
i
felt
like
this
beer
is
among
the
most
boring
beers
ive
ever
tasted
i
have
never
been
a
very
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
beer
is
the
exception
the
ufo
hefeweizen
has
an
indescribably
smooth
and
refreshing
taste
this
organic
beer
is
so
fresh
and
easily
fits
the
bill
especially
on
those
hot
summer
days
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
regardless
of
whether
you
like
wheat
beers
overall
very
good
american
wheat
beer
very
flavorful
and
clean
beer
thats
got
the
perfect
mix
of
spices
and
malts
to
make
a
beer
with
great
color
aroma
and
taste
overall
not
too
impressed
with
this
wheaty
lacks
a
broader
dimension
of
flavors
which
for
this
beer
are
consistentdusty
chalky
lemon
grain
just
not
appetizing
doesnt
come
close
to
touching
the
trademark
wheats
of
weihenstephan
hackerpschorr
and
paulaner
but
very
drinkable
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
its
not
too
bold
like
some
german
hefeweizens
and
it
has
a
great
balance
between
the
flavors
from
the
yeast
malt
and
citrus
its
not
trying
to
be
anything
too
fancy
which
i
think
makes
it
a
great
hefeweizen
for
a
summer
afternoon
o
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
there
is
nothing
that
special
about
ufo
its
just
over
all
a
nice
wheat
crisp
beer
good
beer
for
warm
weather
the
smell
has
a
slight
vanilla
citrus
the
color
is
a
cloudy
golden
like
a
good
wheat
beer
should
be
there
seems
to
be
some
slight
citrus
flavors
but
they
are
so
faint
you
have
to
really
concentrate
to
catch
em
but
over
all
this
is
a
nice
crisp
fresh
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
what
id
expect
carbonation
is
in
effect
without
being
spritzy
the
body
is
appropriately
light
and
crisp
which
make
it
refreshing
and
drinkable
d
very
drinkable
overall
crisp
and
fairly
well
balanced
feels
a
touch
empty
and
could
have
used
a
bit
more
flavor
overall
this
beer
is
not
bad
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
think
maybe
it
should
be
like
a
dollar
cheaper
d
good
but
not
special
an
easy
drinker
but
it
seems
like
i
could
drink
an
average
wheat
beer
over
an
average
lager
any
day
refreshing
overall
drinkablity
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
pretty
stale
even
though
the
freshness
date
is

3
months
away
this
beer
is
much
like
the
ufo
white
both
have
basically
the
same
characteristics
both
are
wheat
beers
and
they
both
look
pretty
much
identical
from
the
pour
the
main
difference
is
that
the
ufo
hefeweizen
doesnt
have
the
citrus
like
the
white
has
i
found
that
the
flavor
of
this
one
fell
apart
when
comparing
the
two
of
them
together
the
hefe
was
just
overall
on
the
bland
side
not
much
stood
out
other
than
it
being
a
smooth
wheat
beer
personally
i
prefer
the
white
over
this
one
any
day
very
worthy
but
i
kinda
like
my
beers
a
little
stronger
to
be
honest
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
american
pale
wheat
ales
it
is
definitely
not
a
real
hefeweizen
despite
what
the
label
says
and
i
think
this
is
a
good
thing
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
a
few
years
ago
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
unfortunately
it
got
placed
on
my
beers
i
enjoy
but
dont
buy
often
because
theyre
super
easy
to
get
list
today
was
a
warm
sunny
day
and
it
seemed
like
a
perfect
choice
as
i
mentioned
in
the
taste
section
this
beer
is
wonderfully
unoffensive
just
drink
it
and
enjoy
the
sun
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
hefe
beers
this
is
another
unfiltered
hefe
but
it
is
smooth
with
a
lot
of
flavor
definitely
a
summer
beer
i
hate
when
they
serve
this
beer
with
an
orange
this
is
not
a
cheap
beer
pouring
into
a
glass
is
a
must
to
bring
out
all
of
the
aromas
poured
a
medium
yellow
with
an
average
sized
white
creamy
head
that
lasted
throughout
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
mild
of
a
earthy
yeast
cereal
malts
and
a
nice
hint
of
citrus
it
tasted
very
yeasty
in
the
begining
and
finished
with
a
yeastymalty
flavor
that
had
strong
hints
of
citrus
and
clove
with
the
flavor
staying
with
you
for
only
a
short
while
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
watery
yet
creamy
in
texture
with
a
flat
carbonation
overall
a
very
nice
refreshing
wheat
ale
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
on
a
nice
spring
day
with
a
slice
of
lemon
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
somewhat
sweet
and
sticky
on
the
palate
drinks
okay
but
this
is
pretty
average
from
top
to
bottom
if
its
there
ill
drink
it
but
wouldnt
purchase
separately
with
an
abundant
selection
of
other
hefes
around
good
one
finger
head
of
white
foam
leaving
a
good
heaping
of
clinging
lace
in
its
trail
color
is
a
4
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
like
roasted
wheat
malt
and
some
citrus
taste
is
well
balanced
flavors
of
roasted
wheat
oats
corn
and
some
rice
there
is
also
a
goodly
amount
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
finish
much
better
than
a
soft
drink
in
fullness
and
creaminess
good
tingle
from
the
carbonation
crisp
and
smooth
enough
to
drink
plenty
much
better
than
a
yard

overall

c
i
owe
that

for
showing
me
this
beer
its
a
rather

hefeweizen
that
shakes

with

was
hoping
for
a

a

although
i
stand
by
my
decree
against
labeling
american
wheats
as
hefeweizens
this
one
stands
slightly
above
that
crowd
i
believe
mainly
on
the
basis
of
the
hop
flavors
and
slight
esters
that
seem
to

very

would

order
this
beer
again
d
this
is
a
good
session
beer
characteristics
of
a
hefeweizen
are
lacking
not
exactly
what
you
would
expect
i
would
have
a
few
if
i
was
watching
sunday
football
all
day
ill
have
this
beer
again
this
is
a
very
light
bodied
beer
and
it
doesnt
have
a
mouthfeel
of
an
unfiltered
ale
finishes
quickly
without
any
real
lingering
flavor
if
i
was
drinking
this
blind
i
most
likely
would
have
pegged
it
as
a
munich
helles
lager
or
something
along
those
lines
clean
malt
body
not
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
a
bit
of
spiciness
on
the
finish
d
you
could
drink
a
hundred
of
these
very
tasty
d
very
drinkable
a
very
good
example
of
an
americanstyled
hefe
that
drinks
more
like
a
lager
lack
of
bittering
hops
to
clean
the
palate
on
the
finish
might
start
making
the
lingering
banana
a
bit
much
after
a
few
of
these
but
its
a
subtle
taste
rather
than
dominating
like
it
is
in
the
flying
dog
need
to
try
with
a
lemon
wedge
to
see
how
that
affects
the
finish
this
could
well
make
my
short
list
of
hot
summer
day
beers
d
easy
to
drink
but
watery
slightly
above
your
average
beer
on
drinkability
very
light
on
an
ending
note
harpoon
needs
to
properly
name
this
beer
it
should
just
be
labelled
a
wheat
beer
and
not
a
hefe
calling
it
a
hefe
is
a
bit
misleading
there
just
isnt
enough
ester
character
in
this
beer
to
call
it
a
hefeweizen
d
i
could
put
down
a
sixer
of
this
no
problem
actually
this
became
my
beer
of
choice
this
year
tailgating
harpoon
i
feel
gave
up
a
little
on
this
beer
just
a
little
more
love
and
this
could
be
the
beer
they
want
it
to
be
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
golden
lemon
color
with
a
white

and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
is
some
slightlytart
wheat
plus
some
lemon
orange
and
a
bit
of
the
harpoon
yeast
the
taste
is
a
bit
plain
with
just
very
mild
citrus
and
a
bit
of
light
grain
light
body
and
the
carbonation
carries
off
many
of
the
flavors
before
they
really
develop
drinks
fairly
well
nice
and
crisp
drinkability
well
it
did
the
trick
with
a
fish
stick
and
vegetable
meal
but
its
not
great
wheat
beer
its
too
carbonated
and
the
label
is
a
misnomer
but
its
an
okay
beer
good
appearance
but
thats
about
it
o
easy
and
pleasant
to
drink
very
good
for
thirst
quenching
or
to
accompany
mildly
flavored
foods
not
bold
or
complex
enough
to
hold
interest
as
a
sipper
overall
good
representation
for
the
style
and
i
dont
see
a
reason
why
it
wouldnt
be
enjoyable
or
at
the
very
least
tolerable
overall
this
was
a
boring
bland
beer
easy
to
drink
and
inexpensive
it
doesnt
taste
bad

i
was
somewhat
let
down
and
could
best
describe
this
particular
sample
as
only
average
but
it
mainly
just
tastes
watery
some
malt
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
has
some
texture

point
of

is
the

very
light

easy
drinking
for

poured
a

ill
have
it
again
in
a
pinch
its
not
too
bad
but
its
far
from
the
best
khiasmusjun

which
is
how
the
label
describes
it
as
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
which
is
how
ba
labels
it
it
would
score
higher
this
simply
doesnt
meet
the
hefe
style
which
doesnt
make
it
a
bad
beer
just
mislabeled
i
should
also
note
that
ive
had
this
with
a
lemon
maybe
a
little
salty
medium
carbonation
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
savor
andor
ponder
carbonation
ok
this
beer
needs
to
get
spiced
up
but
still
not
bad
but
would
not
be
my
first
choice

i
waited
till
november
to
sample
theres
always
next
year
i
suppose
this
is
one
of
the
better
wheat
beers
i
have
had
what
was
funny
was
that
i
had
it
on
tap
at
outback
steakhouse
of
all
places
what
else
was
funny
was
that
the
waiter
told
me
it
was
some
ufo
beer
from
norway
hahaha
these
people
need
to
get
their
stuff
straight
next
thing
you
know
bud
will
be
an
import
from
andorra
anyways
it
was
a
real
refreashing
beer
it
was
hearty
in
the
wheat
area
but
wasnt
too
overbearing
it
was
balanced
well
with
slight
malts
and
hops
it
went
down
smooth
and
quenched
my
thirst
im
not
sure
of
the
appearance
but
i
gave
it
a
3
5
because
i
saw
what
it
probably
could
have
been
it
was
served
to
me
in
a
frozen
mug
so
i
never
really
got
a
good
head
from
it
and
there
was
ice
in
it
damn
those
that
put
good
beer
in
frozen
mugs
damn
you
after
seeing
a
few
guys
on
my
campus
wearing
ufo
tshirts
i
put
this
high
on
my
list
of
beers
to
try
for
no
other
reason
than
to
see
how
mediocre
it
was
im
trying
it
now
and
and
its
barely
a
step
up
from
mediocre
i
was
going
to
give
it
a
4
for
taste
but
realized
that
for
a
wheat
beer
it
has
little
flavor
all
the
other
characteristics
are
there
but
when
i
see
unfiltered
wheat
beer
on
the
label
i
want
to
feel
as
if
i
just
did
a
faceplant
in
the
middle
of
kansas
no
such
luck
here
kemosabe
poured
out
a
straw
like
color
very
cloudy
medium
white
head
that
goes
down
to
a
thin
lace
didnt
have
high
expectations
for
this
one
mostly
because
i
dont
like
this
style
of
brew
but
like
everything
else
dont
knock
it
before
you
try
it
i
tried
it
and
it
was
good
there
were
citrus
and
banana
and
slight
malt
flavors
all
in
this
brew
easy
to
drink
smooth
medium
bodied
brew
there
was
also
a
banana
aftertaste
not
a
bad
thing
this
was
a
good
brew
this
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
quickly
dissolves
to
a
broken
collar
around
the
surface
the
aroma
is
a
pleasant
combination
of
clove
lemon
citrus
yeast
and
wheat
each
sip
of
this
very
drinkable
thin
bodied
beer
begins
with
a
citrus
flavor
the
middle
is
filled
with
clove
lemon
banana
and
citrus
with
a
wheat
malt
flavor
in
the
background
holding
it
all
together
it
finishes
dry
with
a
banana
flavor
left
on
the
palate
i
enjoyed
the
mouthfeel
of
this
offering
at
first
i
thought
it
might
be
too
thin
but
again
as
the
glass
emptied
i
realized
that
it
was
a
real
smoothness
and
not
wateriness
that
i
was
sensing
though
never
having
a
bite
it
does
have
a
mediumbodied
finish
easily
drinkable
i
would
likely
choose
this
over
many
american
hefes
ive
tried

a

it
at
the

the
head
that
was
produced
was
a
dense
creamy
foam

it
was
fairly

the
aromas
were

wheat
grains
some
fruit
light
banana
and
citrus
earth
tones

tones
the
flavors
that
came
out
were

had

kind

not

still

another

one
i
would

taste

there
are
alot
better
american
hefeweizens
arcadia
whitsunpenn
hefe
tabernash
etc
but
not
to
badwould
be
much
better
with
a
lemon
not
one
of
the
better
harpoon
beers
but
it
is
drinkable
pours
a
hazed
golden
hue
with
a
healthy
sized
two
finger
head
and
leaves
a
brilliant
layer
of
lacing
around
my
pint
glass
this
beer
is
definitely
a
bastardized
example
of
a
wheat
lies
under
the
american
wheat
category
in
my
opinion
aroma
has
slight
lemony
tones
with
hints
of
a
metallic
offness
to
it
no
special
fireworks
missing
some
serious
yeast
characteristics
the
taste
is
a
slight
buttery
sweetness
with
some
contrasting
hop
bitterness
apparent
in
the
flavor
profile
slight
mild
banana
tones
with
a
nice
smoot
finish
one
refreshing
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
light
to
medium
bodied
and
this
example
of
a
hefeweizen
is
a
bit
under
carbonated
in
my
opinion
the
drinkability
factor
is
good
but
nothing
extradordinary
from
this
mediocre
americanized
classic
style
of
yeast
with
wheat
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
nice
this
was
definitely
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
with
wicked
drinkability
and
was
moderately
complex
keeping
my
taste
buds
happy
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
light
gold
color
and
formed
a
huge
bubbly
white
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
banana
and
cloves
a
flavor
of
hops
some
malt
and
citrus
a
fairly
light
finish
and
another
good
session
hefe
but
not
up
there
with
the
top
ones
nice
and
yeasty
with
wheat
flavors
on
top
a
touch
fruity
nice
hop
balance
with
nice
lemon
overtones
added
by
the
lemon
redhook
hefe
is
my
favorite
local
hefe
but
this
is
a
close
second
one
of
the
better
american
hefeweizens
on
the
market
great
to
see
this
on
tap
all
over
boston
ufo
is
up
there
with
the
most
refreshing
and
best
summer
time
brews
it
poured
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
pure
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
very
fine
sediment
no
visible
particles
aroma
is
citrusy
lemons
mostly
along
with
some
banana
notes
very
crisp
taste
was
very
smooth
citrusy
hops
with
a
pleasantly
bitter
finish
again
very
refreshing
and
also
very
drinkable
putting
down
a
6pack
on
this
warm
spring
night
should
not
be
a
problem
highly
recommended
this
unfiltered
exterrestrial
entity
is
a
must
buy
tastes
very
crisp
lemony
wheat
mouthfeel
not
much
like
a
true
hefeweizen
but
a
nice
refreshing
brew
nonetheless
reminded
me
a
bit
of
saranacs
wheat
pilsner
if
this
were
just
a
little
bit
fullerbodied
and
sweeter
it
would
be
a
very
good
brew
for
hot
weather
cloudy
amber
beer
pours
with
a
white
head
and
shows
good
retention
the
smell
is
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
coriander
and
citrus
not
bad
but
nothing
special
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
malt
bitter
hops
and
some
yeast
all
noticeable
it
is
fairly
well
balanced
but
doesnt
impress
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
and
leaves
you
yearning
for
just
a
little
more
malt
body
the
drinakbility
is
again
average
as
the
flavor
isnt
overly
satisfying
and
neither
is
the
mouthfeel
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
so
many
other
hefes
that
are
more
enjoyable
that
i
dont
expect
to
buy
this
one
again
purchased
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
followed
the
directions
for
pouring
down
to
the
very
swishing
of
the
product
cloudy
and
light
my
conclusion
bland
with
little
taste
no
wonder
harpoon
recommends
putting
a
lemon
in
it
they
should
put
this
out
in
the
summer
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
very
nice
white
foam
that
leaves
good
lace
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
modest
but
with
citrus
and
wheat
coming
through
the
taste
is
good
and
smooth
wheat
and
yeast
but
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
medium
body
the
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
refreshing
hefeweizen
style
beer
poured
a
giant
soapy
white
head
about
2
inches
high
the
color
was
a
light
gold
and
definately
unfiltered
looks
like
smoke
swirling
inside
the
glass
a
light
hazy
body
with
fair
amounts
of
lace
a
slight
hop
and
wheat
aroma
the
taste
was
of
lemonwheatand
bittering
hops
the
texture
and
finish
were
watery
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
easy
an
average
wheat
beer
nothing
special
pours
cloudyyellow
in
color
with
a
small
head
the
smell
is
sweet
lemons
with
a
hint
of
yeast
very
light
in
terms
of
body
and
doesnt
impress
me
that
much
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
turn
to
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
when
i
need
some
refreshment
i
also
like
to
have
a
couple
of
these
at
the
harpoon
summer
fest
a
pretty
good
stab
at
the
style
from
the
people
harpoon
harpoons
unfiltered
offering
interesting
name
rather
standard
wheat
brew
pour
is
a
cloudy
yellow
with
substantial
white
head
that
makes
its
presence
known
but
for
only
a
few
seconds
aroma
is
mostly
earthy
with
some
fruity
characteristics
as
well
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
citric
and
bitter
all
at
once
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
if
a
little
overcarbonated
could
probably
put
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
would
probably
elect
for
something
else
not
to
say
its
a
bad
beer
i
think
ive
just
been
inundated
with
wheat
beers
if
they
had
just
called
it
a
light
wheat
beer
it
would
have
gotten
higher
marks
because
in
my
opinion
thats
what
this
is
5kd
approved
im
not
a
big
weiz
fan
but
i
love
this
beer
the
yeast
really
comes
out
and
none
of
that
fruity
flavor
of
a
cheap
imported
weiz
i
think
its
much
better
than
oberon
but
this
could
be
me
very
much
in
the
american
style
of
hefeweizen
yeast
was
a
moderate
flavoring
component
clean
without
much
contribution
from
the
yeast
other
than
a
light
bready
flavor
very
smooth
and
drinkable
and
nice
warm
weather
choice
i
am
never
one
for
american
hefewiezens
as
they
usually
try
to
have
too
much
of
a
tang
in
order
to
replicate
the
germans
however
this
is
one
of
the
better
amercian
versions
i
have
tried
a
good
amount
of
yeast
is
present
yet
is
not
definable
crisp
and
tangy
yeasty
kick
but
not
overly
faint
spice
here
but
again
subtle
this
beer
does
not
try
to
be
more
than
it
is
and
that
it
why
it
is
so
enjoyable
i
was
surprised
but
happy
when
i
tried
this
beer
most
of
the
best
hefes
i
have
tried
have
been
imported
but
harpoon
hit
the
jackpot
on
this
one
very
smooth
and
drinkable
with
or
without
food
add
a
slice
of
lemon
it
enhances
the
flavor
of
this
beer
cheers
not
a
bad
beer
easily
drinkable
and
if
you
pay
enough
attention
you
start
to
notice
the
esters
you
expect
in
a
hefe
still
too
american
to
be
a
good
hefe
pours
a
hazy
bright
yellow
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
smell
is
slightly
weak
and
contains
mostly
wheat
with
slight
yeast
taste
is
full
of
wheat
but
slightly
lacking
in
the
yeast
department
the
yeast
flavor
is
there
but
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
offering
from
harpoon
it
could
use
a
slightly
fuller
yeast
flavor
but
beyond
that
it
is
a
great
offering
at
2
75
for
a
20
oz
draft
and
being
as
drinkable
as
it
is
you
will
find
me
drinking
it
all
night
nice
deep
yellow
color
with
white
foamy
head
good
haziness
like
a
good
wheat
should
have
wheat
malt
is
apparent
in
the
flavor
crisp
finish
with
a
light
to
medium
body
this
is
a
brew
one
can
stick
to
for
an
evening
decent
thirstquencher
with
balanced
wheat
flavor
all
in
all
i
think
this
is
way
too
understated
nothing
is
jumping
out
and
grabbing
me
laughable
that
they
call
this
a
hefe
there
is
tartness
and
tasty
citrus
qualities
but
there
isnt
any
flavor
i
would
venture
to
say
a
larger
dose
of
yeast
could
do
the
trick
however
it
is
not
entirely
unpleasant
each
sip
leads
to
another
and
its
a
real
winner
in
the
thirstquenching
department
good
pick
for
a
hot
day
and
could
actually
be
an
ok
choice
for
someone
who
hasnt
had
any
experience
with
hefes
and
doesnt
want
anything
overwhelming
on
their
first
try
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
beer
i
couldnt
detect
too
many
of
the
classic
hefeweizen
flavors
or
aromas
i
guess
it
compares
favorably
to
american
competitors
but
stick
with
the
germans
if
you
want
the
real
thing
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
a
firm
white
head
over
a
spritzy
carbonation
tart
almost
lemony
taste
with
some
yeast
complexity
nicely
balanced
refreshing
brew
better
suited
to
a
summer
day
than
a
cold
winters
nite
another
light
wheat
beer
that
doesnt
match
up
with
authentic
hefe
weizens
not
my
favorite
from
harpoon
but
it
was
worth
trying
notes
this
is
byfar
one
of
the
better
america
wheat
beers
around
one
could
say
it
is
comparable
to
widmer
or
pyramid
if
not
better
flavourful
yet
on
the
clean
side
and
very
well
balanced
this
sample
was
decanted
gently
to
leave
most
of
the
sediment
behind
though
if
you
want
more
of
yeasty
nutty
character
swirl
the
yeast
in
notes
easy
drinking
well
made
i
could
drink
this
all
day
the
taste
is
weak
but
mostly
adjuncts
of
corn
or
rice
faint
touches
of
lemon
or
citrus
hit
the
tongue
but
they
are
fleeting
and
almost
imperceptible
im
very
disappointed
in
this
entry
as
saranacs
are
usually
a
lot
of
fun
and
tasty
o
nice
beer
for
a
barbecue
or
a
warm
summer
day
overall
not
as
good
as
some
other
summer
ales
i
have
had
but
definitely
satisfying
at
the
bbq
salud
o
it
is
decent
for
what
it
is
it
is
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
that
is
bad
12oz

a
semi
translucent
dark
straw
color
with
no
head
virtually
no
lacing
aromas
of
wheat
lemon
malts
and
a
bit
floral
the
taste
is
mostly
wheat
along
with
some
lemon
in
the
background
some
floral
and
orange
notes
as
well
a
bit
of
a
soapy
finish
light
mouthfeel
overall
its
an
ok
summer
beer
light
bodied
with
a
crisp
spicy
hop
bite
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
yeast
light
fruit
and
pale
malt
notes
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
subtle
dry
bitterness
with
some
grassy
floral
hops
countered
by
light
fruit
sweetness
and
subtle
biscuit
flavored
malt
not
overly
complex
but
its
crisp
and
refreshing
with
some
nice
hop
flavor
a
nice
beer
on
this
100
degree
day
watery
and
bland
super
thin
body
a
true
tickers
beer
ive
definitely
had
worse
just
your
typical
summer
beer
you
always
hope
for
more
but
it
never
delivers
overall
pretty
average
at
best
nothing
really
stood
out
aside
from
the
lemon
poured
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
decent
cap
of
bubbly
offwhite
foam
aromas
of
floral
hops
somewhat
grassy
bubblegum
and
biscuit
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
good
hops
as
well
as
some
pears
peaches
and
biscuit
malt
odseemed
like
it
was
going
to
be
a
superior
bore
at
first
but
the
flavor
isnt
half
bad
summer
beers
usually
dont
rock
this
one
is
a
mediocre
summer
beer
therefore
it
is
not
that
great
in
my
book
but
there
is
something
about
it
that
maintains
my
interest
at
least
for
the
first
bottle
d
american
wheat
with
witesque
riffs
but
it
doesnt
work
not
blended
melded
but
rather
angular
and
constructed
not
proportional
and
balanced
comes
across
as
overly
gimmicky
in
the
lemon
direction
could
be
improved
with
more
orange
citrus
some
character
and
robustness
to
malts
and
less
lemon
not
the
most
flavorful
of
beers
but
it
drinks
pretty
nicely
on
a
hot
summer
day
got
it
in
the
summer
12pack
for
10
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
lemon
flavor
but
i
can
see
what
they
were
going
for
o
no
joy
here
just
really
bland
have
yet
to
meet
a
saranac
that
really
does
anything
for
me
maybe
next
time
pours
a
relatively
clean
amber
small
pillowy
head
with
decent
retention
scent
is
quite
off
from
what
most
pale
wheats
typically
smell
like
the
lemon
is
there
but
the
backbone
screams
of
poor
quality
malts
or
even
adjuncts
and
stale
hops
very
little
wheat
character
taste
is
a
little
more
focused
lacks
much
malt
flavor
a
little
bit
of
staleness
rescued
by
some
citrus
notes
under
carbonated
for
the
style
comes
across
as
medium
in
body
not
your
typical
pale
wheat
some
minor
off
notes
stand
out
a
tad
more
then
they
should
not
bad
but
not
something
i
need
to
sample
again
this
beer
is
mediocre
at
best
overall
there
isnt
much
here
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
just
another
one
of
those
breweries
that
are
scared
to
put
out
a
bold
product
like
boulder
beer
and
bjs
pizza
too
bad
nice
light
mouthfeel
and
an
easy
drinker
it
didnt
hit
the
spot
but
it
was
nice
on
a
hot
day
d
pretty
tasty
while
drinking
it
i
was
actually
not
sure
if
it
was
a
pale
wheat
or
a
pils
but
regardless
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
look
forward
to
having
another
carbonation
fizziness
and
a
medium
body
ok
on
the
beach
on
a
hot
day
but
that
is
about
it
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
just
didnt
get
excited
about
it
i
liked
it
better
than
sam
adams
summer
ale
o
tangy
and
a
little
citric
very
mild
to
the
point
of
boredom

thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
malts
and
grains
taste
is
crisp
some
citrus
and
grains
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
owouldnt
recommend
theres
just
not
much
positive
its
lightish
has
a
funky
aftertaste
and
i
dont
think
ill
revisit
it
again
the
crack
glug
was
yet
another
reminder
as
to
why
it
is
important
to
decant
not
only
did
i
get
two
fluffy
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
but
it
looked
like
summer
in
a
glass
color
was
a
beautiful
sunshine
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
couple
that
with
the
cloudlike
head
and
you
have
a
summers
day
i
am
a
visual
beer
guy
i
suppose
nose
had
a
metallic
aspect
to
it
uh
oh
fortunately
the
smell
did
not
translate
to
the
taste
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
and
the
flavor
was
big
on
lemon
which
were
probably
the
natural
flavors
alluded
to
earlier
it
was
a
pretty
mellow
drink
as
wheat
beers
are
wont
to
be
finishing
with
a
light
zestiness
making
it
quite
refreshing
i
probably
would
not
want
more
than
one
but
if
i
were
accompanied
by
someone
who
really
likes
this
sort
of
thing
it
would
be
in
my
cooler
d
a
miss
for
me
the
citrus
and
fruit
seems
too
forced
to
be
enjoyable
and
i
am
not
finding
this
a
refreshing
summer
beer
as
i
thought
i
would
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
more
the
lemon
flavor
is
just
too
strong
decent
base
beer
but
wanted
more
cheers
if
kids
still
had
lemonade
stands
and
sold
this
the
world
would
be
a
better
place

o
this

in

12
pack
i

so
ill
have
another

to
mull
over
its

and
there

out

onot
a

the
wheat
profile
could
have
been
better
pretty
average
stuff
just
wish
it
would
have
kept
up
the
taste
throughout
the
beer
o
this
seems
like
a
decent
beer
ruined
by
the
lemon
addition
i
think
the
trend
in
my
taste
is
to
like
saranacs
base
beers
but
any
time
they
add
fruit
it
doesnt
mesh
well
generally
would
advise
against
this
one
though
it
is
refreshing
enough
drinkability
ssa
reminds
me
a
bit
of
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
minus
the
fruity
pebbles
kick
natch
one
to
pound
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
pound
while
out
at
the
lake
with
friends
or
not
drink
at
all
i
think
i
know
which
option
ill
go
for
i
see
a
few
notations
of
people
wanting
to
call
this
a
witbier
but
come
on
lets
not
be
hasty
at
the
very
best
its
like
a
weird
creepy
distant
cousin
the
rest
of
the
proud
witbier
family
never
calls
doesnt
accept
fb
friend
requests
from
or
responds
to
requests
to
borrow
money
d
i
like
this
better
that
the
sam
adams
or
brooklyn
summer
ale
and
would
definitely
buy
a
12
pack
when
the
weather
turns
around
finally
almost
done
with
the
saranac
summer
pack
jesus
its
taking
me
way
the
hell
too
long
anyway
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
coriander
orange
and
lemon
zests
and
a
good
amount
of
wheat
the
taste
runs
along
a
very
similar
course
but
with
more
wheat
and
some
sharp
flowers
thrown
in
the
fruitier
notes
are
decidedly
toned
down
mere
shadows
of
their
nasal
selves
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
clean
finish
overall
an
okay
brew
but
one
that
really
doesnt
endear
itself
to
me
as
mild
as
it
is
i
still
cant
see
myself
wanting
to
drink
much
more
of
this
maybe
its
too
mild
i
dunno
this
is
ok
but
thin
of
character
simple
and
crude
it
offers
so
little
that
it
quickly
becomes
tiresome
d
refreshing
yet
not
quite
there
for
a
summer
beer
lemon
flavors
work
well
but
it
still
seems
a
bit
boring
a
somewhat
decent
summer
ale
you
can
do
better
or
worse
d
i
guess
you
could
drink
one
pretty
quickly
on
a
really
warm
day
i
do
not
want
this
near
my
lips
at
all
with
the
superior
variety
of
summer
beers
on
the
market
tastes
like
lemon
more
than
anything
i
guess
relatively
speaking
its
a
decent
saranac
brew
it
tastes
like
something
that
isnt
offensive
for
once
and
its
actually
assertive
dont
necessarily
know
that
i
want
the
flavor
they
decide
to
get
assertive
with
be
lemon
but
its
a
start
there
really
isnt
much
else
to
talk
about
lemon
dominates
too
expensive
to
be
drinkable
too
sour
and
sweet
one
dimensional
lemony
as
well
this
beer
is
getting
low
marks
because
it
doesnt
resemble
a
beer
more
like
an
energy
drink
that
being
said
it
doesnt
taste
bad
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
one
of
these
during
an
outdoor
bbq
while
playing
volleyball
pale
yellow
colored
with
caramel
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
shrinks
to
a
skim
fairly
quickly
lemon
peel
and
coriander
stand
out
bigtime
in
the
aroma
with
a
fresh
breadiness
lemon
and
coriander
with
a
mild
wheat
malt
tang
yup
this
beer
is
just
a
filtered
wit
beer
with
caramel
coloring
added
its
not
really
bad
its
just
misclassified
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
pretty
run
of
the
mill
wit
unless
you
love
lemon
flavor
because
this
brew
delivers
that
brown
bottle
with
no
indication
of
freshness
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
appears
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
bit
of
haze
from
a
pour
that
included
a
few
drips
of
sediment
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
appears
and
doesnt
hang
around
long
light
bready
and
caramel
aroma
with
plenty
of
lemon
zest
and
spice
almost
like
cinnamon
that
carries
over
into
the
flavor
taste
includes
caramel
malt
like
sweetness
blended
with
the
seemingly
fake
lemony
flavor
and
a
slight
touch
of
hop
bitterness
there
is
an
aftertaste
of
lemon
and
spice
left
lingering
in
the
mouth
that
doesnt
really
blend
all
that
well
with
the
caramel
like
sweetness
from
the
malt
light
feel
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
this
is
another
offering
that
would
best
be
enjoyed
after
sweating
it
up
in
the
heat
and
just
drinking
without
savoring
any
flavor
this
isnt
something
i
would
try
again
flavor
is
rather
simple
and
straightforward
with
a
light
lemony
wheat
flavor
feel
is
only
lightly
coarse
in
texture
yet
not
overly
sweet
either
making
for
a
decent
drink
overall
but
with
a
subdued
character
d
well
its
kind
of
good
i
got
4
because
this
made
samuel
adams
summer
beer
seem
like
it
had
more
flavor
which
it
did
not
pretty
good
if
its
an
alternative
to
bmc
since
its
in
a
case
at
a
mere
24
dollars
with
tax
pretty
drinkable
d
drinkable
but
im
already
bored
halfway
through
simply
needs
more
flavour
saranac
summer
ale
pours
a
light
gold
with
a
small
but
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
slightly
grainy
malted
wheat
with
a
hint
of
corriander
more
crisp
kind
of
sweet
wheat
in
the
flavor
the
crisp
grainy
wheat
flavor
gives
way
to
a
tangy
almost
slightly
sour
flavor
that
lingers
in
the
after
taste
i
just
noticed
on
the
label
that
there
is
a
lemon
flavor
added
to
the
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
picked
it
out
the
bitterness
is
subdued
as
is
any
hop
flavor
d
overall
not
very
special
however
a
decent
refreshing
summeer
brew
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
going
down
and
is
pretty
smooth
it
does
have
some
carbonation
but
does
not
hinder
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
a
good
summer
beer
but
not
groundbreaking
comments
certainly
not
to
style
but
a
decent
wheat
ale
beginners
beer
this
beer
has
no
faults
but
no
highlights
either
mouthfeel
is
actually
somewhat
decent
with
minimal
carbonation
not
really
your
best
saranac
you
can
have
if
you
buy
the
summer
pack
give
the
two
summer
ales
to
someone
else
who
might
want
some
variety
from
their
assumable
macro
comes
across
as
kind
of
a
kolsch
and
wit
combo
nice
this
beers
orange
color
is
fitting
with
the
citrus
smell
and
taste
that
i
picked
up
after
i
poured
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
effervescence
is
present
as
in
all
saranacs
ive
tasted
and
beer
is
very
drinkable
poured
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
generous
head
that
rapidly
dissolved
to
a
collar
the
aroma
had
a
soapy
scent
to
it
the
taste
was
lemony
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
good
a
good
beer
one
that
probably
made
the
best
use
of
lemon
in
a
beer
that
i
have
had
that
being
said
i
think
that
may
be
the
reason
a
lot
of
the
great
beers
dont
rely
on
a
lemon
taste
still
liked
it
though
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
refreshing
flavor
is
pretty
good
a
nice
tame
mellow
bready
flavor
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
sweeter
wheat
ales
ive
had
but
i
like
it
this
would
be
a
great
refresher
during
the
warm
months
im
never
expecting
a
lot
with
saranac
beers
but
i
am
always
pleasantly
surprised
it
has
a
good
copper
color
unfortunately
its
got
coloring
added
to
it
odd
the
aroma
is
nice
of
sweet
malt
and
honey
wow
its
a
sweet
brew
honey
malt
sugar
mid
tongue
the
bitterness
starts
to
kick
in
a
good
punch
of
lemon
and
orange
and
some
hop
bite
it
really
helps
clean
the
palate
a
good
brew
for
a
hot
day
and
a
barbecue
i
find
it
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
up
front
but
certainly
a
good
choice
drinkability
very
enjoyable
beer
for
a
hot
and
humid
overall
not
as
horrific
as
it
could
have
been
but
not
something
id
want
again
too
much
lemon
up
front
and
not
done
in
a
way
that
is
a
compliment
to
the
rest
of
the
brew
the
true
dud
in
the
summer
mix
pack
light
bodied
and
high
carbonation
makes
for
a
drinkable
beer
if
you
can
get
past
the
lemon
and
spice
i
think
its
a
bit
too
overwhelming
so
i
will
mostlikely
abstain
from
this
in
the
future
i
am
not
sure
what
happened
to
this
beer
but
whatever
it
is
a
correction
seems
necessary
forthwith
drinkability
ill
pass
on
the
next
one
i
offered
this
to
my
bud
light
lime
drinking
brother
and
he
actually
enjoyed
it
good
riddance
id
hate
to
drain
pour
this
cause
its
not
that
bad
but
its
definetley
not
for
me
d
just
average
not
much
to
it
its
wet
and
refreshing
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
head
maybe
one
finger
that
gives
way
quickly
there
is
very
little
carbonation
to
be
seen
through
the
glass
the
smell
is
at
first
lemon
but
it
gives
way
to
a
floral
aroma
almost
carnation
like
the
taste
is
floral
with
a
hint
of
lemon
at
the
end
the
taste
is
a
little
more
complex
than
i
thought
with
my
first
one
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
the
drinkability
is
a
little
different
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
wasnt
impressed
with
it
after
having
it
a
couple
weeks
later
in
a
glass
the
taste
doesnt
seem
as
harsh
of
lemons
as
before
and
the
taste
seems
much
more
balanced
after
second
review
i
would
say
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
high
bottle
pours
a
clear
light
orange
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
bready
malt
wheat
light
fruits
cherry
raspberry
and
some
spices
allspice
flavor
is
sweet
and
malty
with
lots
of
dough
notes
and
spices
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
but
definitely
an
interesting
wheat
nice
beer
dlow
abv
refreshing
lemon
zing
light
crisp
body
a
worthy
summer
session
beer
that
would
push
any
bmc
offering
off
the
table
overall
i
often
wonder
where
beer
stops
and
fruity
chemical
concoctions
begin
is
there
a
certain
percentage
of
malt
that
needs
to
be
used
in
order
to
have
a
product
worth
being
called
a
beerwhen
the
fine
print
on
a
bottle
reads
beer
brewed
with
natural
flavors
and
colored
with
caramel
one
has
to
wonder
what
is
this
my
roots
as
a
brewer
tells
me
that
you
dont
need
to
add
caramel
for
color
when
you
could
have
added
some
crystal
malts
to
get
this
beverage
to
the
medium
gold
that
it
currently
is
however
my
business
side
says
if
i
were
trying
to
sell
beer
to
the
tasteless
masses
and
go
with
the
current
trends
i
e
bud
limemiller
chill
then
i
would
make
a
fruity
watered
down
beverage
like
this
but
i
like
beer
and
this
just
doesnt
work
for
me
saranac
from
my
perspective
is
a
company
on
the
brink
of
becoming
a
really
good
brewer
when
they
do
things
like
this
it
sets
them
back
a
few
steps
i
hope
they
can
brush
this
one
off
and
move
forward
by
making
real
beer
from
this
point
forward
overall
a
good
idea
for
a
summer
thirst
quencher
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
cold
ones
on
a
hot
day
id
call
it
a
lawnmower
beer
but
we
hire
landscapers
so
its
an
outdoor
summer
drinking
beer
yeah
that
should
do
this
beer
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
mild
honey
nose
wispy
head
of
light
lacing
thick
and
full
mouthfeel
very
enjoyable
in
the
mouth
a
clean
attack
that
gives
a
touch
of
lemon
and
some
citrus
notes
in
the
flavor
the
finish
is
a
bit
fruity
but
cleans
up
to
not
allow
any
lingering
aftertaste
from
the
fruit
notes
i
am
not
normally
a
big
fan
of
summer
ales
but
i
truly
enjoyed
this
one
definitely
one
of
the
better
summer
offerings
that
is
readily
available
and
widely
distributed
drinkability
its
sweet
but
gassy
crisp
but
watery
strong
nose
but
flavorless
it
feels
like
it
is
missing
something
dvery
drinkable
on
a
warm
day
you
are
not
here
for
taste
as
much
as
for
a
quencher
it
works
well
on
a
very
hot
day
but
beyond
that
it
is
really
kind
of
average
drink
is
unenjoyable
i
almost
had
a
drainpour
but
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
do
it
d
very
quaffable
this
would
be
excellent
on
a
hot
muggy
day
thumbs
up
on
the
saranac
12
beers
of

pack
i
have
officially
justified
impulse
shopping
overall
light
and
mellow
but
a
decent
drinker
alright
but
nothing
special
really
i
would
probably
play
it
safe
and
just
stick
to
a
sam
adams
summer
ale
if
i
were
presented
with
the
choice
between

fading
bone
white
foam
smells
and
taste
is
over
run
with
citrus
mainly
lemon
peel
tastes
a
tad
artificial
to
me
pledgelike
notes
of
grass
and
lightly
toasted
grains
are
also
present
a
bit
thin
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
if
they
could
reduce
the
tartness
this
would
be
much
more
drinkable
given
its

state

one

but
still
doesnt
compare
to
the
other
micros
has
a
bit
of
a
lemony
and
citrusy
taste
to
make
it
summer
like
but
overall
its
a
beer
that
is
lacking
on
body
and
overall
taste
would
try
again
though
thin

a

plays
a

here
softer

more
astringent
than
the

somewhere
in

this
provides
a
nice
feeling
for
summer
even
if
august
in
nj
has
been
unseasonably
autmumnal
shorter
on

to
increase
its
drinkability
no
doubt
this
ale
seems
to
attempt
the
sparkling
aspect
of
a
coopers
perhaps
not
bad
but
flavor
is
elusive
overall
im
a
little
disappointed
with
saranacs
summer
beer
mix
pack
this
was
one
of
the
better
ones
from
the
bunch
but
its
still
merely
average
pours
a
copper
color
practically
no
head
or
lacing
on
the
glass
doesnt
have
that
cloudy
hazy
look
that
most
wheat
beers
ive
tried
had
there
is
a
rather
strong
lemon
zing
in
there
for
quite
the
summer
effect
not
much
else
though
the
lemon
stands
out
and
is
a
little
too
much
even
for
the
summer
the
bottle
says
the
lemon
hints
are
subtle
but
dont
be
fooled
by
that
drinkability
not
a
bad
little
summer
beer
d
a
dry
spicy
summer
brew
that
would
quench
your
thirst
on
a
summer
afternoon
i
would
not
turn
one
down
if
offered
a
seethru
auburntinted
gold
with
a
twofinger
head
that
died
instantly
and
left
a
minor
lace
ring
a
somewhat
odd
smell
of
of
cherries
and
caramel
i
have
no
idea
why
that
comes
across
my
nose
but
thats
what
im
picking
up
with
some
minor
clovepepper
hints
and
citric
hops
a
dull
lifeless
citric
taste
with
a
fluffy
but
empty
medium
body
has
some
spiciness
to
it
with
a
crisp
backbite
but
not
really
a
great
beer
of
the
six
beers
in
the
saranac
summer
sampler
this
one
seems
undeveloped
it
is
missing
something
a
very
typical
summer
ale
nothing
stood
out
for
me
surprisingly
the
other
5
beers
in
the
mixed
party
pack
seemed
a
lot
more
worthy
of
being
called
summer
ales
than
this
one
it
was
decent
very
refreshing
and
smooth
just
not
a
lot
of
flavors
coming
out
looks
like
they
played
the
safe
route
on
this
one
i
wont
being
trying
this
again
although
it
was
decent
nice
drink
pretty
hohum
d
refreshing
im
not
a
big
fan
of
summer
brews
but
this
one
isnt
too
shabby
and
has
some
redeeming
qualities
a
little
more
aroma
and
taste
would
have
helped

part
of
a
summer
sampler
12
pack
some
hits
some
misses
this
was
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
really
special
it
was
a
clear
orange
color
with
a
medium
head
that
retained
pretty
well
not
much
aroma
a
little
grain
detected
not
much
taste
some
citrus
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
it
is
drinkable
in
the
sense
of
downing
a
few
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
very
light
and
crisp
and
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
night
did
still
rather
have
this
beer
than
a
bud
but
by
no
means
would
i
seek
it
out
yet
another
saranac
disappointment
body
is
medium
well
carbonated
and
has
a
crisp
texture
excellent
drinkability
for
the
price
this
is
a
decent
beer
here
i
have
to
take
away
a
little
on
the
drinkability
because
of
that
medicinal
twang
it
hit
me
as
a
little
too
odd
to
be
pleasant
this
would
be
a
good
summer
brew
to
keep
on
hand
poured
out
to
a
deep
sunset
orange
color
with
a
small
white
foam
head
no
lacing
noted
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
sweet
grain
and
citrus
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
flavors
of
citrus
especially
lemon
jump
forward
with
spices
and
fresh
hops
in
the
background
nice
mouthfeel
was
slightly
zesty
with
a
smoothness
accentuated
by
the
hops
pretty
good
drinkability
for
the
summer
months
id
have
no
qualm
about
having
this
in
the
fridge
worth
a
try
thanks
to
connecticutpoet
for
the
sample
drinkability
i
give
it
a
3
because
i
could
see
myself
grabbing
one
of
these
instead
of
some
light
macro
out
of
a
cooler
with
friends
grilling
burgers
and
dogs
in
the
july
heat
otherwise
as
far
as
sitting
down
and
reviewing
this
sucker
or
partaking
in
the
aforementioned
activities
though
i
dont
think
any
of
my
friends
would
randomly
have
saranac
in
a
cooler
though
thats
beside
the
point
the
tastings
not
gonna
happen
again
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
small
very
slightly
offwhite
foamy
head
the
quickly
diminishes
to
a
light
film
very
little
lacing
it
has
a
sweet
smell
of
wheat
and
malt
a
strong
lemon
scent
and
a
little
honey
and
something
herbal
kind
of
like
marjoram
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
typical
wheat
flavors
including
coriander
some
malts
and
hardly
any
hops
the
finish
is
very
lemony
kind
of
like
dish
soap
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
and
a
dry
texture
i
find
the
lemon
to
be
too
strong
and
distracting
not
that
its
distracting
me
from
an
otherwise
decent
beer
not
horrible
but
subpar
beer
and
a
disappointment
pours
a
very
clear
dark
gold
about
of
finger
and
a
half
of
creamy
white
head
that
quickly
drops
to
a
thin
cap
leaving
weak
lacing
strong
wheat
nose
with
a
distinctive
scents
of
lemoncoriander
and
a
sweet
aroma
probably
the
caramel
used
for
coloring
phenolic
wheat
and
cirtus
spice
flavor
jumps
out
initialy
followed
by
strong
yeast
aftertaste
hop
flavor
is
scarce
but
the
wheat
and
spice
flavor
balance
out
for
a
nice
mild
bitterness
and
clean
finish
medium
body
and
well
carbonated
an
excellent
session
brew
with
a
smooth
but
interesting
flavor
but
would
score
higher
if
left
unfiltered
and

d
if
you
like

i
mean
really
like
it
then
this
is
for
you
it
was
just
overly
ordinary
for
a
saranac
but
not
bad
poured
a
bit
more
orange
that
i
expected
and
was
champagne
bubbly
for
a
moment
thin
fading

head
sweet
citrus
on

very
light
fleeting
citrus
and
some
sort
of
spice
that
reminded
me
of
that
indian
spice
that
they
glaze
with
sugar
and
snack
on
i
cant
recall
the
name
no
real
aftertaste
ok
mouthfeel
d
i
could
barely
down
on
bottle
and
i
am
certainly
not
going
for
a
second
this
is
like
a
belgian
wit
gone
wrong
worth
a
try
interesting
summer
offering
matt

did
not
hit
this
one
on
the
head
poured
out
a
clear
light
gold
color
with
a
decent
head
smell
was
mostly
citrus
with
nothing
else
coming
through
very
one
sided
on
the
aroma
side
taste
wasnt
any
better
either
a
ton
of
lemon
flavors
with
some
citrus
and
wheat
flavors
also
coming
through
light
amount
of
malts
underly
the
citrus
flavors
mouthfeel
was
light
and
finished
dry
and
peppery
where
are
they
leading
to
with
this
beer
heck
add
some
coriander
and
well
almost
have
a
wit
just
a
complete
mess
with
this
beer
very
sloppy
pours
a
dark
hazy
yellowish
orange
with
a
cap
of
bright
white
head
lemon
malt
and
a
faint
whiff
of
floral
hops
on
the
nose
very
malty
wheaty
taste
upfront
followed
by
a
surpisingly
large
floral
bitter
taste
light
lemon
permeates
everything
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
low
carbonation
level
this
is
a
pretty
smooth
drinker
overall
this
is
another
decent
beer
from
the
summer
pack
part
of
summer
sampler
pack
poured
a
light
copper
cooper
color
with
white
head
smell
is
strong
of
lemon
and
not
much
else
first
taste
is
very
overpowering
of
lemon
but
with
susequent
sips
this
seems
to
sudside
there
also
becomes
a
slight
background
of
dryness
which
adds
to
the
quality
of
the
beer
beer
definitely
improves
as
the
glass
empties
and
i
start
to
enjoy
it
pretty
good
beer
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
an
eggshell
head
it
has
a
nice
floral
hoppy
aroma
it
has
a
really
nice
blended
taste
it
has
a
good
malt
core
to
it
but
seems
to
have
a
wapper
of
hops
the
hops
adding
a
rather
floral
almost
herbal
set
of
tastes
the
feel
is
medium
and
smooth
with
a
clean
break
at
the
end
of
the
draw
all
in
all
a
good
solid
beer
something
is
not
quite
right
with
this
one
appears
dark
gold
with
little
or
no
head
smells
like
lemonscented
oil
used
for
candles
or
room
deodorizers
taste
like
a
blonde
ale
mixed
with
lemonscented
renuzit
cakes
the
lemon
does
not
come
off
natural
and
this
ruins
it
for
me
the
wife
unit
thought
it
was
ok
but
she
likes
perfumey
floral
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
for
this
style
of
beer
but
it
cannot
overcome
the
flavors
not
recommended
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
finishes
dry
with
the
lemon
and
pepper
lingering
briefly
on
the
tongue
very
average
summer
brew
as
the
lemon
citrus
was
too
overwhelming
another
offering
from
the
summer
mix
this
smells
great
the
aroma
is
lemoney
and
sweet
really
nice
awesome
fluffy
huge
head
and
a
dark
golden
hue
why
does
the
label
tell
me
it
is
colored
with
caramel
come
on
that
is
like
their
mountain
ale
telling
me
it
has
fruit
flavors
whatever
the
taste
is
sorta
orangey
it
tastes
like
a
belgian
white
but
it
doesnt
have
that
cool
unfilteredness
the
mouthfell
is
bubbly
yet
smooth
moderate
i
could
pound
these
not
that
i
would
or
would
i
found
this
one
as
part
of
a
mix
six
pack
of
saranac
brews
since
i
thoroughly
did
not
enjoy
sam
adams
summer
ale
a
much
worthier
brewery
i
had
little
expectations
for
this
surprisingly
much
better
than
the
former
brew
floral
hops
overwhelm
the
smell
and
taste
and
rather
easy
to
down
nothing
exciting
about
the
mouthfeel
or
appearance
i
would
not
buy
a
sixer
of
this
but
it
was
worth
trying
out
for
a
random
wednesday
night
at
home
flavor
is
similarly
flat
with
candylemon
notes
the
thin
mouthfeel
is
pretty
astringent
and
it
makes
the
whole
thing
seem
even
more
biting
and
unpleasant
theres
just
not
much
going
on
here
other
than
the
pez
flavor
and
i
dont
really
dig
it
drinkability
this
is
not
a
bitter
beer
very
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
good
enough
to
standalone
if
you
like
iced
tea
you
ought
to
like
this
brew
pours
a
coppery
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
one
finger
head
fairly
active
carbonation
but
not
overly
fizzy
aroma
is
of
clean
malt
a
kind
of
dry
grassiness
a
hint
of
lemon
peel
taste
is
clean
also
malt
hay
and
a
touch
of
the
lemon
peel
again
on
the
finish
maybe
just
a
hint
of
banana
lightly
hopped
has
a
refreshing
crispness
to
it
medium
mouthfeel
overall
an
ok
beer
would
be
good
at
a
cookout
or
on
a
hot
day
at
the
beach
theres
better

with

the
aroma
was
a
touch

but
very
citric
you
would
have
thought
the
lemon
slice
was
bottled
in
the
beer
taste
was
ok
decent
flavours
of
lemon
bread
a
touch
of
spice
green
pepper
and
or
coriander
and
some
typical
wheat
graininess
no
real
hop
bitterness
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
good
and
carbonation
is
fairly
high
and
the
body
is
light
to
medium
light
drinkability
is
a
bit
under
average
for
some
reason
i
could
never
figure
this
beer
out
fully
every
time
i
thought
i
was
gonna
like
it
something
made
me
back
off
i
think
the
flavours
just
did
not
do
it
for
me
appeared
as
a
light
golden
beer
with
few
streams
of
bubbles
ascending
from
the
bottom
one
finger
creamy
head
goes
down
quickly
aroma
is
of
a
blueberry
bagel
or
muffin
taste
is
similar
but
with
hints
of
lemon
and
spice
aftertaste
is
lemon
peel
bitter
light
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
pretty
ok
beer
i
am
sampling
a
chilled
12
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
color
with
thin
fizzy
white
head
forming
on
the
surface
and
fading
to
an
edge
layer
almost
immediately
aroma
is
light
and
sweet
with
caramel
and
lemony
citrus
notes
mixing
with
some
floral
hops
the
first
sip
reveals
a
lite
crisp
body
with
average
yet
tingly
carbonation
flavor
is
candy
sweet
with
citrusy
orange
coriander
a
dominant
flavor
the
flavor
is
very
mild
overall
and
leaves
a
sugary
sweet
finish
a
nice
attempt
at
tweaking
a
wheat
ale
but
the
sweetness
is
a
little
much
for
me
and
reminds
me
more
of
candy
than
beer
an
interesting
little
thirst
quencher
not
overly
impressive
but
it
functions
and
works
for
what
it
is
i
enjoyed
mine
with
a
mother
corn
squash
and
hominy
casserole
that
was
jazzed
up
with
a
big
jalapeno
bite
and
okra
and
that
seemed
to
work
well
with
the
spicyness
of
my
dinner
notes

certainly
refreshing
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
lacking
not
one
of
my
favorite
american
wheat
beers
the
beer
pours
a
dark
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
wheat
malt
scent
that
is
riddled
with
lemony
zest
and
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
dry
wheat
malt
flavor
with
loads
of
lemon
and
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
to
balance
the
flavor
its
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
i
like
the
use
of
crystal
malts
to
add
a
malty
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
its
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
summer
seasonal
its
not
your
typical
wheat
beer
for
sure
but
it

d
not

many

other
there
so
props
for
that
while
the
focus
is
on
the
fruit
this
does
have
some
things
going
on
in
the
base
wheat
beer
given
the
fruit
and
sweetness
this
could
be
seen
as
a
chick
beer
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
or
maybe
two
in
a
row
but
it
does
make
a
nice
summer
light
and
refreshing
desert
beer
makes
for
a
nice
beer
at
the
pool
its
also
a
much
better
summer
offering
from
saranac
than
their
summer
ale
or
their
summer
brew
slightly
opaque
color
then
it
is
a
style
of

of
wheat
which
is
as
was

quite
light
and
strong
body
weak
and
watery
fortunately
the
aftertaste
safety
such
as
flavored
with
apple
pectin
and
seed
grenades
just
a
little
dope
mix
despite
the
lack
of
finish
the
grenade
brings
a
real
plus
and
it
is
far
from
grenadine
syrup
commercially
available
that
give
too
much
glucose
in
beer
here
everything
is
light
and
the
taste
is
that
of
the
first
wheat
although
it
is
far
from
exceptional
this
is
a
good
fruit
beer
and
not
one
to
shy
away
from
o
i
liked
since
it
had
some
malt
character
im
not
partial
to
flavored
beer
that
are
so
much
so
that
they
are
onedimensional
taste
is
light
grain
crisp
faint
yeastiness
faint
juiciness
lightly
sweet
with
faint
tartness
at
finish
no
pomegranate
taste
is
really
evident
its
not
great
but
its
not
bad
either
picked
this
one
up
for
my
wife
yesterday
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
luckily
i
only
grabbed
one
as
this
one
really
sucked
after
about
half
the
bottle
between
us
we
gave
it
to
hank
the
dog
who
looked
at
it
and
walked
away
poured
a
lightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
very
muted
aromas
a
little
wheat
and
a
little
pomegranate
but
not
much
else
same
on
the
palate
not
a
lot
of
flavor
crisp
and
light
bodied
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
brew
highly
recommended
d
a
great
idea
but
i
just
find
it
lacking
some
tweaks
could
turn
this
into
a
better
beer
but
right
now
its
just
subpar
this
wheat
beer
pours
out
as
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
down
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
little
tart
smelling
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
i
know
how
strong
pomegranates
can
be
so
i
thought
that
this
would
have
a
bigger
flavor
there
is
a
light
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
soft
like
most
wheat
beers
it
poured
a
thick
head
of
a
typical
wheat
and
very
hazy
not
much
to
smell
it
would
have
been
a
very
faint
pomegranatey
slightly
citrusy
fruity
notes
the
taste
wasnt
bad
you
could
tell
it
was
a
wheat
beer
from
the
appearance
but
didnt
taste
much
of
one
very
carbonated
but
didnt
feel
like
it
on
my
palate
i
would
probably
drink
this
beer
again
but
im
a
sucker
for
wheat
bears
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
great
its
crisp
and
lightbodied
the
juiciness
of
the
flavor
especially
helps
the
drinkability
dont
come
in
here
expecting
anything
more
than
what
the
bottle
says
pomegranates
and
wheat
a
successful
beer
pomegranate
wheat
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
minimal
head
and
no
lasting
lace
the
aroma
has
hints
of
dough
fruit
and
vanilla
followed
by
a
flavor
with
a
good
balance
of
pomegranate
juice
sweetness
and
a
citrusy
tang
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
more
pomegranate
showing
through
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
brew
highly
recommended
d
its
not
an
awful
beer
but
its
not
the
greatest
either
average
across
the
board
its
not
something
id
ever
seek
out
again
12
oz
bottle
pours
golden
hazy
from
yeast
with
a
nice
head
lots
of
carbonation
aroma
is
fruity
reminds
me
of
soda
bready
light
body
taste
like
sweet
carbonated
fruit
juice
sugar
and
honey
dominate
the
flavor
some
pomegranate
perhaps
good
for
thirst
quenching
but
not
much
else
dthis
is
ok
but
i
am
certainly
not
jonesing
for
another
looks
like
an
extremely
clear
wheat
beer
the
absolute
lack
of
red
color
shows
how
little
pomegranate
is
really
in
this
beer
either
that
or
they
used
a
noncolored
extract
unfortunately
pomegranate
juice
is
quite
expensive
and
rarely
used
to
its
awesome
potential
i
mostly
smell
wheat
yeast
in
the
aroma
and
the
smell
is
quite
mild
along
with
the
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
redness
to
the
head
which
is
interesting
pomegranate
sits
in
the
back
of
the
sip
mild
fruity
flavor
slight
tartness
that
mixes
well
with
wheat
yeast
estsers
that
are
happening
aside
from
that
you
have
an
american
wheat
highly
drinkable
refreshing
summer
beer
i
definitely
drank
this
beer
offseason
pretty
good
though
d
very
drinkable
beer
the
overall
mix
of
fruit
flavors
on
top
of
the
wheat
beer
is
fairly
well
balanced
and
the
beer
overall
is
pretty
refreshing
drinkability
is
really
good
bought
this
for
my
girlfriend
and
she
thought
it
was
very
krunkable
i
would
buy
this
again
just
because
its
cheap
and
local
and
a
very
easy
drinker
but
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
this
nothing
special
d
decent
fruit
beer
but
not
really
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
really
dont
know
why
these
beers
cost
more
10
for
a
case
basically
i
guess
a
college
kid
could
get
drunk
on
these
ontap
at
flying
saucer
on
fire
sale
for
3
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
hazy
orange
with
a
thin
off
white
head
aroma
is
sweet
fruits
and
not
much
else
the
taste
is
sweet
fruits
with
slight
malts
and
hops
but
not
enough
to
overcome
the
lingering
sweetness
the
beer
is
of
course
light
but
the
sweetness
gets
in
the
way
this
is
a
beer
almost
worth
trying
but
also
worth
passing
by
d
easy
to
drink
a
little
sweet
but
it
goes
down
very
smooth
d
great
little
summer
brew
here
low
abv
and
very
good
flavors
not
overly
fruited
up
nice
blend
worth
a
shot
drinks
really
easy
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
pretty
refreshing
good
smooth
mouth
feel
it
is
pretty
average
in
body
the
fruit
flavor
has
a
good
ratio
in
it
and
is
not
over
powering
at
all
that
makes
this
beer
a
good
summer
beer
to
have
d
i
have
never
tried
pomegranate
so
dont
really
know
what
to
look
for
but
quite
enjoyed
this
brew
the
only
other
pomegranate
beer
ive
had
was
from
moylans
which
was
merely
okay
so
ill
admit
i
was
a
little
worried
about
saranacs
version
this
is
a
nice
little
surprise
a
faddish
beer
could
have
some
appeal
to
a
type
of
beer
drinker
but
only
for
a
short
time
d
eh
its
alright
pomegranate
doesnt
mix
well
with
beer
maybe
if
the
flavors
were
a
little
stronger
it
would
as
is
meh
d
a
nice
decent
beer
i
was
excepting
better
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
recommends
to
those
seeking
a
solid
wheat
profile
wit
a
subtle
red
fruit
tang
better
alternative
than
bmc
brown
bottle
with
no
indication
of
freshness
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
appears
a
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
that
is
gone
half
way
through
the
experience
aroma
smells
primarily
of
wheat
with
a
bit
of
sulfur
and
a
slight
hint
of
unidentifiable
fruit
in
the
back
that
is
most
likely
the
pomegranates
contribution
taste
is
mostly
wheat
with
again
the
same
unidentifiable
fruity
sweetness
however
there
is
a
lingering
flavor
in
your
mouth
very
similar
to
whenif
you
chew
up
the
core
of
a
pomegranate
seed
light
feel
with
a
moderately
high
level
of
carbonation
as
it
warms
a
bit
more
of
the
pomegranate
flavor
comes
forward
and
contributes
to
the
sweetness
as
a
lawnmower
beer
it
is
drinkable
enough
that
i
could
see
easily
being
able
to
drink
a
few
of
these
however
if
really
looking
to
sit
and
enjoy
the
flavor
of
a
wheat
beer
i
would
most
likely
pass
on
this
in
the
future
this
is
a
solid
good
wheat
nothing
to
get
you
out
of
your
seat
and
go
out
and
by
a
case
but
easy
drinking
ale
its
light
too
which
helps
make
it
work
as
an
session
brew
has
a
maltyhoppy
flavor
that
is
seems
to
merge
into
the
pomegranate
which
seems
to
somehow
hide
its
bitter
aftertaste
in
some
hidden
place
nothing
exciting
but
a
good
brew
none
the
less
d
really
a
treat
and
have
three
more
a
fruit
beer
done
right
that
is
also
affordable
also
great
tasting
well
done
saranac
taste
a
sweet
mess
just
drink
kool
aid
and
amp
up
the
sugar
blend
it
with
one
of
their
other
questionable
beers
amber
wheat
and
youve
got
this
beer
just
a
brutal
drainpour
save
this
for
a
sugar
craving
or
something
offers
just
enough
fruitiness
to
keep
things
interesting
yet
without
overwhelming
the
senses
and
compliments
the
wheat
flavors
well
overall
worth
the
price
probably
would
i
buy
it
again
no
recommend
it
no
search
it
out
no
d
the
2nd
best
saranac
brew
ive
had
so
far
a
nice
little
fruit
beer
which
would
be
a
real
crowd
pleaser
pours
a
hazy
rusty
gold
color
with
fluffy
white
head
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
tart
and
acidic
with
very
little
touches
of
grain
taste
is
rather
mild
the
pomegrantate
is
forward
slightly
tart
and
acidic
touches
of
lemon
and
the
wheat
is
pale
to
the
extent
it
does
not
shine
through
light
bodied
active
carbonation
slightly
dry
a
decent
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
and
doesnt
overpower
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
thin
white
head
quickly
dissipates
leaving
only
a
straw
colored
body
and
some
minimal
soapyish
lacing
aroma
is
of
mildly
sweet
malt
and
some
mild
fruit
flavor
that
i
assume
is
pomegranate
taste
is
actually
pretty
refreshing
again
mildly
fruity
not
too
sweet
im
sure
because
of
an
addition
of
wheat
light
citrus
notes
round
it
off
nothing
exceptional
but
solid
summerytype
beer
paired
pretty
well
with
french
toast
this
beet
is
light
and
pretty
drinkable
going
down
smooth
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
this
would
go
well
with
some
nice
bbq
d
i
have
fond
memories
early
on
in
my
beer
drinking
of
happily
sessioning
these
for
whatever
reason
i
had
trouble
finishing
this
one
tonight
comments
the
surprise
is
how
well
they
have
accentuated
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
with
a
very
well
done
balance
between
the
normal
wheat
flavortartness
and
pomegranate
fruit
the
pomegranate
adds
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
this
beer
interesting
without
interfering
with
its
basic
refreshing
nature
the
columbus
hops
character
comes
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
so
if
you
like
citrusy
american
hops
let
this
beer
warm
slightly
before
you
drink
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruit
and
grains
taste
is
good
fruits
but
not
really
sweet
well
balanced
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
brew
pretty
good
summer
beer
but
its
too
sweet
for
my
taste
d
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
however
i
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
two
or
three
in
one
sitting
it
can
become
alittle
too
sweet
d
sits
light
enough
wouldnt
protest
another
a
very
modest
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
though
any
wheat
fan
may
find
this
interesting
go
for
it
taste
is
pretty
decent
the
fruit
is
mild
and
crisp
so
its
not
overwhelming
its
very
easy
drinking
and
the
fruity
flavors
are
subdued
by
the
wheat
leadi
to
a
real
easy
drinking
fruit
beer
d
nothing
complex
about
this
beer
and
about
what
i
expected
but
refreshing
nonetheless
not
over
the
top
with
the
pomegranate
and
it
actually
goes
well
in
this
beer
im
wary
of
fruit
beers
especially
of
fruit
wheats
and
doubly
especially
weary
of
fruit
wheats
with
cute
animals
on
the
label
but
this
isnt
bad
this
is
a
beer
that
could
be
sipped
or
drank
very
quickly
as
a
refresher
i
drank
mine
way
too
quickly
but
that
s
cause
i
enjoyed
it
d
hate
to
call
it
a
hot
weather
brew
because
tonight
was
anything
but
however
id
probably
enjoy
it
more
outside
in
the
sunshine
paired
pretty
well
with
my
nachos
salsa
con
queso
at
4
7
abv
its
meant
to
be
a
light
session
refresher
for
those
warmer
days
or
for
the
nondiscriminating
fruit
beer
fan
you
know
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
white
a
thick
white
fomay
head
that
retreats
quickly
leaving
behind
some
mild
lacing
the
smell
is
rather
weak
with
a
watereddown
pomegranate
trying
to
clash
with
an
even
weaker
bananaclove
the
taste
has
more
strength
to
it
but
not
by
all
that
much
the
pomegranate
is
still
quite
watereddown
while
the
yeastiness
fights
with
it
at
all
sides
resulting
in
something
of
a
confused
weissbier
taste
luckily
though
the
body
isnt
too
thick
or
heavy
keeping
the
drinkability
at
a
relatively
high
level
hazy
honey
blonde
with
a
big
soapy
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
behind
pomegranate
and
wheat
malt
make
up
the
smell
fruity
light
and
a
tad
under
malted
pretty
much
sums
it
up
light
bodied
borderline
watery
with
soft
carbonation
easy
drinking
enough
you
could
do
worse
but
you
could
do
a
lot
better
too
ok
this
beer
didnt
have
a
huge
pomegranate
taste
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
its
a
quaffer
with
some
light
flavour
which
keeps
it
crisp
refreshing
but
lacking
the
xfactor
that
would
make
it
appeal
to
me
value
1
50
for
a
single
not
bad
at
all
a
very
good
wheat
beer
with
the
added
pomegranate
flavours
certaintly
something
i
could
drink
more
of
i
must
admit
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
as
i
have
never
tried
a
brew
which
has
been
infused
with
pomegranate
so
here
goesit
pours
a
semi
cloudy
very
pale
amber
hue
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
foamy
two
finger
head
that
hangs
around
with
very
nice
lacingthe
aromas
are
straight
out
pomegranate
its
very
dominant
on
the
nose
with
feint
hints
of
wheat
aswellthe
taste
doenst
fair
so
well
to
be
honest
it
has
a
averagely
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
sweetsour
taste
almost
funky
with
pomegranate
being
abit
too
stand
outish
in
this
beer
for
my
liking
and
the
wheat
definately
plays
second
fiddle
even
though
you
still
taste
it
id
prefer
a
better
pairing
or
less
pomegranateso
obviously
this
brew
doesnt
fair
to
well
with
me
on
a
drinkabilty
scale
i
like
the
effort
and
for
the
summer
its
a
good
beer
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
clear
very
slightly
reddish
tinged
golden
yellow
color
there
was
a
large
fizzy
white
head
on
it
that
dropped
away
almost
immediately
the
aroma
is
mild
some
slightly
sour
pomegranates
as
well
as
some
wheat
slightly
sour
taste
some
wheat
and
some
pomegranate
its
not
bad
but
im
not
sure
if
i
like
it
or
not
ontap
at
the
buffalo
brewpub
a
chick
drink
but
not
bad
a
good
appearance
with
a
lasting
white
head
super
lacey
with
cloudy
bannana

juice
infusion

whatever
makes
the
combination
with
real
sourish
wheat
very
pineapple
fresh
though
neutral
aroma
creamy
mouthfeel
representing
this
sweet
beer
style
found
everywhere
poured
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
moderate
head
that
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
pretty
weak
i
got
nothing
i
was
expecting
something
very
sweet
but
the
taste
was
actually
just
a
bit
sweet
and
more
sour
i
liked
it
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
i
did
like
this
one
better
than
the
ba
average
got
this
bottle
in
the
mixed
12pack
of
summer
i
probably
never
would
have
bought
this
on
its
own
poured
into
my
pint
glass
pours
a
murky
reddish
gold
with
no
head
on
top
at
all
no
lace
either
smells
of
faint
fruits
and
mealy
bread
the
mouth
is
highly
carbonated
to
an
almost
harsh
level
not
pleasant
mild
unoffensive
flavors
in
this
some
subtle
fruitiness
honey
and
slight
bittering
grass
finish
not
as
bready
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
not
too
bad
but
not
that
great
the
finsh
is
again
lacking
with
some
vague
aftertaste
that
is
not
unpleasant
just
lacking
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
not
the
type
of
beer
that
i
normally
drink
but
there
are
better
fruity
wheat
beers
out
there
would
be
nice
with
bbq
chicken
or
anything
with
a
sweet
tangy
sauce
i
would
say
this
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
would
drink
it
again
but
there
isnt
too
much
i
would
pass
up
if
offered
instead
overall
a
swing
and
a
miss
amybe
a
foul
tip
at
best
on
this
one
nothing
really
drawing
you
to
take
the
next
sip
not
horrific
and
easy
to
drink
as
the
flavors
are
muted
and
mellow
but
you
will
not
seek
this
one
out
multipack
residual
purchase
at
best
pomegranates
are
a
bitter
fruit
and
i
think
they
captured
an
authentic
taste
in
that
respect
it
might
be
an
unusual
combination
but
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
even
with
a
thicker
body
than
expected
it
would
be
easy
to
go
through
these
on
a
hot
day
pretty
drinkable
but
this
has
to
be
your
thing
right
on
the
border
between
an
american
pale
wheat
and
a
fruit
beer
a
cold
hazy
dark
yellow
color
with
a
decent
cap
of
foam
banana
apples
clove
and
cinnamon
in
the
nose
the
body
of
the
beer
reflects
the
wheat
character
spice
and
malt
upfront
it
moves
dryly
through
the
center
a
tart
pomegranate
and
citrus
finish
laced
with
spice
overall
better
than
i
expected
d
i
struggled
a
bit
to
get
thru
this
beer
both
times
i
had
it
the
sickly
sweet
pomegranate
flavors
and
wheat
taste
conflict
with
each
other
and
the
result
is
an
unpleasant
simple
beer
which
i
can
only
assume
was
targeted
at
females
and
macro
beer
drinkers
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
flavored
wheat
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
thumbs
down
from
me
saranac
maybe
you
should
have
kept
that
honey
you
traded
and
used
it
to
brew
something
decent
pours
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
pinky
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
good
lacing
the
smell
is
of
fruit
and
floral
aromas
the
taste
is
a
harsh
pomegrante
taste
the
taste
isnt
overly
fruity
and
you
cant
really
grasp
what
the
other
flavors
are
the
mouthfeel
is
harsh
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
okay
it
is
slightly
refreshing
yet
it
does
have
a
harsh
bite
to
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
lemon
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
smell
is
light
on
the
nose
hints
of
fruit
with
a
slight
wheat
presence
taste
is
surprising
it
has
a
real
juice
presence
that
is
rich
yet
not
cloying
the
wheat
aspect
is
understated
but
there
mouthfeel
is
rcih
and
smooth
very
surprising
not
crisp
like
other
wheats
drinkability
is
good
due
to
smooth
quality
actually
a
tad
heavier
than
most
wheats
but
a
nice
quality
d
certainly
not
the
most
drinkable
brew
in
the
summer
pack
but
drinkability
is
high
nonetheless
overall
once
again
another
offering
from
the
summer
pack
thats
not
groundbreaking
but
solid
drinkability
an
above
average
lawnmower
beer
the
fruit
is
not
overpowering
one
of
saranacs
better
offerings
i
could
have
several
the
pour
was
what
you
would
expect
from
a
wheat
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
there
wasnt
the
overpowering
pomegranate
flavor
that
i
was
worried
about
but
in
this
case
it
wasnt
a
good
thing
the
traditional
wheat
flavors
were
masked
by
a
bitter
slightly
fruity
tang
that
left
my
toungue
itchy
the
mouthfeel
was
rough
and
i
struggled
to
get
through
it
not
a
horrible
beer
but
just
not
good
not
really
what
i
wanted
to
accompany
my
bacon
and
eggs
there
are
better
fruit
wheat
beers
to
be
had
cloudy
gold
in
color
with
little
to
no
head
mild
fruitiness
to
the
nose
but
it
stays
pretty
neutral
by
comparison
to
other
fruit
beers
the
attack
is
sweet
there
are
no
traditional
beer
flavors
at
first
as
the
sweetness
stands
out
the
flavor
is
definitely
fruity
and
a
bit
syrupy
the
finish
is
surprisingly
clean
the
beer
is
good
but
it
is
not
nearly
as
unique
as
the
name
might
suggest
its
just
another
type
of
fruit
that
has
been
used
in
a
beer
and
no
earth
shattering
new
flavor
has
come
from
it
the
sweetness
imparts
a
thickness
to
the
mouthfeel
d
for
what
it
is
it
really
hits
the
spot
a
simple
wheat
ale
that
has
enough
pomegranate
to
really
stand
out
d
about
halfway
through
this
and
didnt
even
notice
seems
like
a
good
picnic
beer
edit
this
last
half
is
getting
harder
and
harder
to
drink
definitely
a
little
cloying
going
on
here
drinkability
enjoyable
but
not
really
beer
flavored
more
juice
flavored
i
think
i
will
enjoy
the
next
beer
but
would
not
buy
a
six
pack
dunder
5
with
enough
flavour
and
a
sharp
crisp
feel
this
is
a
very
nice
summertime
drinker
certainly
the
kind
of
beer
begging
for
a
bbq
or
concert
on
the
lawn
i
dont
know
catching
maybe
some
sense
of
hops
as
this
warms
up
a
nice
try
but
no
sense
of
pomegranates
the
last
time
i
had
this
it
was
at
the
boilermaker
15k
race
up
near
the
brewery
and
they
were
handing
out
free
glasses
outside
to
the
runners
managed
to
snag
some
even
tho
i
didnt
run
a
foot
brings
back
those
memories
and
makes
me
look
forward
to
summer
a
bit
more
i
really
liked
it
will
definitely
get
it
again
probably
take
with
me
to
the
beach
on
vacay
no
complaints
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
11191800
sampled
on
may
20
2009
it
pours
a
cloudy
lemonylooking
amber
with
a
dash
of
fuzzy
head
that
sticks
around
for
most
of
the
sampling
i
really
do
not
catch
whiff
of
anything
extraordinary
in
the
aroma
it
has
a
faint
wheatlike
or
grassy
smell
but
i
did
not
notice
any
pomegranate
kind
of
a
watered
down
mouth
feel
the
flavor
lends
itself
ok
for
a
hot
day
but
it
is
rather
tart
and
sour
i
notice
a
tidbit
of
pomegranate
in
the
taste
but
not
the
aroma
eh
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
am
surprised
this
beer
has
been
rated
so
highly
by
the
rest
of
the
ba
community
if
this
beer
stuck
true
to
the
name
pomegranate
and
put
more
of
it
in
the
drink
this
probably
would
have
been
a
damn
near
perfect
beverage
d
easy
to
drink
would
never
turn
one
down
and
may
look
for
it
again
d
id
survive
if
it
was
the
only
beer
available
but
i
really
prefer
standard
wheat
beer
or
any
beer
without
the
curiosity
factor
beer
number
two
out
of
my
summer
sampler
pack

into

an
orangeamber
color
with
about
14
to
12
inch
of
light
head
smell
is
light
and
fruity
taste
is
light
and
smooth
wheaty
with
a
nice
splash
of
pomegranate
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
the
light
smooth
wheat
flavor
with
the
crisp
splash
of
pomegranate
makes
for
a
wonderful
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
sunshine
final
thoughts
this
is
a
standout
for
saranac
its
unusual
without
straying
too
far
from
what
a
wheat
beer
should
be
i
will
definitely
keep
enjoying
this
one
give
it
a
try
and
be
surprised
at
how
good
saranac
can
be
overall
tastes
more
like
a
honey
wheat
needs
both
more
pomegranate
and
wheat
great
light
beer
for
an
early
friday
afternoon
off
work
d
slightly
above
average
for
the
style
the
sweetness
cuts
the
wheat
flavor
well
overall
a
very
bland
brew
not
my
kind
of
beer
but
i
appreciate
its
uniqueness
drinkability
is
a
bit
above
average
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
and
i
wouldnt
have
expected
someone
to
choose
pomegranate
as
a
fruit
flavor
to
blend
it
with
however
with
the
current
craze
being
pomegranates
i
understand
why
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
bag
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
one
cool
juggling
bear
on
the
label
pours
a
honeygold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
of
a
reddish
hue
faint
aroma
of
wheat
malt
taste
is
very
predestrian
with
no
outstanding
qualities
some
malt
with
a
little
fruity
sweetness
not
over
the
top
like
some
fruit
beers
are
very
refreshing
good
for
parties
if
for
no
other
reason
than
showing
off
the
label
overall
the
pomegranate
tones
are
too
weak
sourness
is
there
but
the
flavor
of
the
brew
is
weak
overall
tastes
like
a
sour
belgian
witte
i
probably
wont
be
eager
to
try
this

a
part

pack
picked
up
at
the
grocery
store
pours
a
medium
yellow
slightly
cloudy
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
are
a
little
too
sour
for
my
taste
too
fruity
though
not
particularly
pomagranate
i
probably
wouldnt
do
this
one
again
d
average
but
would
probably
be
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
day
i
find
this
very
drinkable
despite
not
going
wild
over
it
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
brewery
in
general
but
this
is
okay
am
i
glad
i
tried
it
yes
would
i
buy
it
again
probably
not
drinkability
well
its
easy
to
drink
it
tastes
fine
overall
i
think
the
flavor
is
weak
so
im
not
too
excited
about
it
even
if
i
could
easily
have
a
couple
d
not
bad
good
as
a
summer
beer
overall
the
pomegranate
flavor
is
not
overwhelming
its
just
enough
to
give
it
that
wow
factor
cloudy
yellowish
red
minimal
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
smell
is
light
wheat
with
fruit
but
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
pomegranate
taste
is
hard
to
pin
down
yeasty
and
wheaty
and
slight
fruitlike
taste
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
pomegranates
to
me
theres
a
strange
taste
and
now
that
i
notice
it
the
smell
is
similar
im
assuming
it
comes
from
the
malt
and
wheat
but
i
cant
describe
it
it
kind
of
tastes
like
some
breweries
smell
that
strange
maltlike
aroma
but
ive
never
tasted
it
in
a
beer
before
lots
of
carbonation
thin
would
be
refreshing
if
it
were
a
little
fruitier
you
could
throw
down
a
bunch
of
these
if
you
wanted
but
i
wouldnt
this
is
my
first
saranac
brew
hopefully
their
other
offerings
are
a
little
better
nice
beer
to
have
on
pic
nics
camping
trips
bbqs
and
tailgaiting
when
your
friends
are
drinking
bmc
d
good
drinkability
truly
ive
never
had
a
pomegranate
so
im
not
sure
what
its
exactly
supposed
to
taste
like
also
this
beer
had
such
little
flavor
of
this
fruit
i
couldnt
really
make
an
opinion
i
dont
like
my
fruit
beers
overpowering
in
anyway
but
this
one
seemed
to
not
have
enough
and
tastes
like
a
bland
wheat
ale
basically
this
created
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
with
very
low
retention
the
color
was
a
cloudy
orangishamber
the
nose
was
on
the
sour
side
with
a
light
fruitiness
underlying
the
sourness
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
slightly
sour
taste
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
light
sweet
fruitiness
the
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
this
was
definitely
a
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
humid
summer
evening
theres
a
gentle
creaminess
to
the
palate
too
that
makes
this
one
especially
drinkable
all
in
all
not
a
bad
summer
beer
id
drink
it
again
large
offwhite
head
with
very
good
retention
and
impressive
lacing
honey
colored
with
orange
hues
aromas
are
light
generic
fruits
sour
wheat
and
a
pleasant
sweetness
flavors
are
not
as
sweet
as
the
aromas
suggests
wheat
flavors
come
through
clearly
especially
on
the
finish
pomegranate
flavors
are
underneath
but
present
tangy
with
a
pleasant
crisp
nip
at
the
end
light
body
and
very
summery
a
good
version
of
a
fruit
beer
because
it
refrains
from
being
too
sugary
and
the
flavors
are
unique
id
want
a
6
of
these
if
i
was
at
one
of
these
drug
friendly
music
festivals
where
i
could
carry
one
around
and
wait
for
some
hippy
chick
to
stumble
into
me
shed
be
amazed
at
how
yummy
and
organic
a
pomegranate
beer
sounds
and
ask
for
some
assuming
that
her
somewhat
clear
skin
and
carefree
attitude
were
charming
enough
to
get
a
free
beer
from
any
guy
at
the
place
id
let
her
finish
mine
of
course
as
we
walked
back
to
my
tent
for
the
rest
this
was
the
first
beer
i
reviewed
however
it
was
on
tap
that
time
it
was
much
better
on
tap
i
dont
think
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
in
a
bottle
but
if
its
hot
out
and
its
on
tap
i
may
be
tempted
overall
an
enjoyable
summer
beer
not
to
sweet
but
easy
to
quaff
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
and
received
a
dark
gold
body
with
medium
cloudiness
and
a
two
finger
head
that
died
slowly
and
left
some
lacings
a
somewhat
standard
wheat
beer
smell
some
yeast
strains
along
with
minor
spice
and
a
decent
amount
of
fruit
the
smell
was
a
little
strained
though
a
little
different
due
to
the
pomegranate
berries
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
taste
lightbodied
and
fluffy
with
some
sweetness
coming
from
the
wheat
and
some
fruit
flavors
being
that
i
like
to
drink
pomegranate
flavored
aquafina
i
could
pick
out
the
pomegranate
and
it
is
mixed
in
alright
but
it
sticks
out
and
gives
a
typical
wheat
beer
a
somewhat
sour
strain
and
a
little
syrupiness
a
good
beer
but
i
hope
they
tweak
with
the
recipe
a
little
for
next
summer
d
i
tihnk
i
found
a
favorite
american
pale
wheat
ale
uncomplicated
but
without
really
being
boring
judging
within
style
to
me
this
seems
underrated
a
very
good
warm
weather
beer
though
i
could
enjoy
this
anytime
unfiltered
thats
also
a
nice
touch
file
under
a
pleasant
surprise
definitely
give
this
one
a
go
i
generally
prefer
something
other
than
wheat
beers
and
fruit
beers
but
this
fruity
wheat
really
hits
the
spot
it
is
smooth
mellow
and
crisp
with
great
drinkability
try
it
d
this
a
good
summer
wheat
brew
has
a
touch
of
fruit
flavors
coming
out
but
the
wheat
does
has
front
and
center
stage
good
brew
for
the
style
drinkability
is
fairly
high
low
alcohol
and
decent
flavor
make
this
one
easy
to
drink
not
overly
complex
and
slightly
sweet
an
enjoyable
brew
d
refreshing
a
highly
drinkable
summer
beer
i
could
put
back
34
on
a
sunny
day
however
the
supposed
pomegranate
is
nowhere
to
be
found
other
than
a
general
fruitiness
and
the
flavors
not
very
complex
a
good
wheat
ale
but
i
wouldnt
drink
it
out
of
season
drinkability
i
wouldnt
buy
a
6pack
of
this
but
overall
it
isnt
too
bad
and
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
which
is
more
than
i
would
say
for
a
lot
of
fruit
beers
even
though
the
wheat
certainly
helps
it
be
more
tolerable
than
if
it
were
just
a
lager
12oz

white
head
that

good
amount
of

around

the
slightly
floral

the
taste
is
a

not

cloying

is
definitely
a
good
thing

pretty
solid

that
does

the

like
some
tend

do
it

highly
drinkable
and
would
be
a

thirst
quencher
on
a
warm

worth
a
shot
too
sweet
but
the
pomegranate
flavor
is
nice
worth
a
shot

not
my
style
but
a
nice
fruit
wheat
beer
nonetheless
good
summer
brew
very
drinkable
on

own

with
a
meal

summertime
man
its
hot

indeed

single
finger
head
that
lingered
the
smell
is
very
fruity
with
somemild
wheat
characteristics
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
citrus
that
is
cut
rather
quickly
by
slightly
tart
pomegranate
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
watery
with
less
carbonation
than
i
expected
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
drink
but
its
more
flavor
than
beer
im
not
normally
much
for
flavored
beers
but
this
came
in
the
summer
sampler
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
easily
accessible
and
refreshing
this
could
make
some
people
curious
about
craft
beer
those
that
already
like
craft
should
find
this
to
be
a
nice
palate
cleanser
as
well
as
a
nice
take
on
a
style
that
is
easy
to
get
wrong
body
medium
soft
and
slick
good
drinkability
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
pretty
good
nothing
special
but
by
no
means
bad
notes
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
summertime
outdoor
party
drink
it
sounds
good
but
all
i
can
think
is
that
its
a
blander
and
less
adventurous
version
of
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
another
clouded
wheat
ale
with
a
touch
of
a
pink
haze
going
on
large
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
awhile
nice
bands
of
lacing
form
as
well
aromatics
a
little
bit
of
random
tart
smelling
jam
with
some
citrus
and
yeast
qualities
going
on
pretty
tame
in
the
scent
flavor
sweet
tart
i
guess
pomegranate
but
im
not
an
avid
indian
apple
eater
so
if
you
ask
me
that
could
be
any
tart
fruit
flavor
with
a
standard
american
wheat
not
a
bad
combo
just
forgettable
and
nothing
more
memorable
even
though
its
high
in
antioxidants
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
carbonation
nothing
extraordinary
only
bland
yeast
stays
on
the
palate
drinkability
wise
i
could
pass
on
another
of
these
and
i
gasp
at
the
thought
of
a
whole
twelve
pack
of
this
stuff
like
on
the
label
i
saw
theyre
selling
it
in
that
format
and
cans
i
was
excited
about
the
cans
but
why
cant
they
just
put
the
kolsch
or
golden
pilsner
in
those
instead
id
buy
either
the
grain
is
soured
by
the
pomegranate
in
the
aftertaste
the
fruit
has
taken
over
by
this
point
but
because
of
the
specific
taste
of
pomegranate
the
taste
isnt
what
i
consider
desirable
in
my
opinion
pomegranate
fruit
itself
has
a
wonderful
starting
flavor
but
bad
aftertaste
the
beer
holds
to
this
and
although
some
people
may
love
it
it
doesnt
necessarily
turn
my
screws
d
nice
but
not
great
i
found
this
to
be
refreshing
and
enjoyable
i
would
probably
drink
this
again
but
i
dont
know
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
this
is
an
okay
wheat
beer
probably
the
most
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
slightly
refreshing
overall
dont
pick
this
one
up
thinking
youre
going
to
get
a
blast
of
pomegranate
though
its
there
in
the
flavor
but
its
not
the
main
flavor
element
in
the
beer
its
pretty
good
for
a
fruit
beer
if
you
like
fruit
beer
not
my
thing
really
but
i
can
certainly
see
this
one
appealing
to
people
that
like
the
style
flavorful
and
unique
i
could
drink
these
all
day
one
of
the
best
fruit
beers
in
my
opinion
worth
the
cash
nice
enough
as
a
lunch
time
beer
probably
fairly
decent
as
a
summertime
cooler
as
well
worth
a
try
and
would
likely
fit
in
nicely
in
certain
situations
but
not
one
id
go
looking
for
maybe
the
kind
of
beer
to
have
when
youre
not
looking
for
a
beer
saranac
pomegranate
wheat
has
potential
but
it
will
probably
have
to
be
brewed
by
some
other
brewery
for
that
potential
to
be
realized
that
pretty
much
sums
it
up
the
end
saranac
pomegranate
wheat
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
i
dont
get
much
out
of
the
aroma
this
is
a
light
bodied
wheaty
beer
that
has
a
touch
of
what
i
guess
is
pomegranate
its
not
unpleasant
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
d
a
tremendous
session
beer
truly
is
a
relaxing
beer
to
be
enjoyed
while
it
may
be
a
springsummer
seasonal
i
could
enjoy
this
all
year
long
found
this
seaosnla
option
at
the
saranac
brewpub
at
the
albany
airport
on
draft
my
expectations
were
definitely
low
looked
a
nice
ruby
with
a
fair
abount
of
head
and
carbonation
they
could
not
have
balanced
out
the
fruit
with
the
hops
and
malts
any
better
actually
quite
tasty
but
not
over
the
top
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
and
worth
trying
again
i
could
drink
a
boatload
of
this
based
on
the
sheer
quenching
it
does
on
the
thirst
but
honestly
not
a
real
great
brew
imo
d
i
think
i
have
finally
figured
it
out
just
drink
a
saranac
beer
do
not
review
it
much
more
enjoyable
that
way
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
and
has
been
for
me
d
one
was
fine
for
me
but
i
can
see
this
as
a
good
summer
poolside
beer
probably
belongs
in
the
class
of
lawn
mower
beers
although
i
would
say
this
more
flavorful
wonderfully
surpised
by
the
taste
of
this
beer
i
am
usually
very
adverse
to
fruit
beers
but
was
in
an
adventurous
mood
and
figured
what
the
hell
defninitely
a
great
summer
beer
ended
up
buying
an
entire
case
have
not
been
able
to
find
it
in
my
area
will
have
to
travel
up
to
ny
in
the
summer
to
buy
more
very
tasty
d
not
to
drinkable
like
a
sour
v8
only
with
a
thiner
body
pass
drinkability
much
like
the
bear
on
the
label
this
beer
does
an
decent
job
at
juggling
the
pomegranates
though
maybe
this
beer
would
be
better
had
i
not
drank
it
in
the
dead
of
winter
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
was
at
first
wary
of
it
because
of
the
recent
fad
of
putting
pomegranate
in
everything
but
i
was
proven
wrong
it
smells
about
how
you
would
expect
fresh
wheat
beer
and
a
hint
of
pomegranate
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
very
pleasant
touch
of
wild
fruit
this
beer
could
easily
have
mass
appeal
i
would
buy
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
not
a
typical
fruit
beer
well
balanced
not
too
sweet
crisp
and
refreshing
great
wheat
flavor
with
a
hint
of
pomegranate
which
is
one
of
the
best
fruits
ever
in
case
you
didnt
know
if
youre
a
fan
of
long
trails
blackbeary
wheat
be
sure
to
give
this
a
try
overall
lets
be
honest
if
youve
tried
it
you
probably
liked
it
but
dont
want
to
admit
it
to
your
friends
its
like
a
guilty
pleasure
you
see
the
girls
at
the
bar
drinking
smirnoff
pomegranate
and
you
dont
want
anything
to
do
with
something
that
sounds
remotely
close
to
that
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
if
you
havent
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
but
theres
a
reason
why
the
west
end
made
this
a
year
round
brew
pours
a
clouded
strawgold
nose
is
slightly
fruity
with
pomegranate
i
mean
it
just
smells
like
you
would
expect
i
am
starting
to
think
that
most
of
these
fruit
beers
are
all
the
same
anyways
onward
flavor
is
actually
a
bit
more
full
bodied
that
i
had
expected
smooth
and
even
i
am
not
really
sure
how
much
it
tastes
like
pomegranate
but
there
it
is
mild
wheat
characteristics
the
strongest
part
here
is
the
fruit
not
much
else
feel
is
a
bit
thick
on
the
liquid
with
a
typical
carbonation
overall
it
is
actually
pretty
drinkable
imo
it
doesnt
totally
suck
as
a
lot
of
these
fruit
beers
end
up
being
pours
a
cloudy
yellowbronze
color
with
a
thin
bone
white
head
that
burns
off
quickly
spotty
lacing
berry
fruits
and
honey
in
the
nose
lightbodied
and
sweet
with
tart
berry
i
have
to
assume
it
is
pomegranate
malt
and
honey
flavors
the
finish
is
short
and
sweet
with
a
sweet
fruit
aftertaste
nothing
really
noteworthy
overall
but
now
i
can
check
off
another
random
fruit
added
to
beer
12
oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
served
in
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
orangey
copper
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
loose
tan
head
smells
like
a
nondescript
wheat
beer
with
hints
of
pomegranate
and
maybe
lemon
it
has
a
pleasant
flavor
with
pomegranate
nutty
wheat
and
some
green
hops
on
top
of
a
lightlycarbonated
medium
body
that
leaves
a
light
finish
decent
but
there
are
better
fruitwheat
beers
out
there
this
one
needs
a
bit
more
depth
tastes
fruity
esters
over
gentle
malt
sweet
and
mild
hop
bitter
and
flavor
finishes
dry
with
a
cleansing
carbonation
that
doesnt
provide
acid
or
sting
pomegranate
is
present
early
and
ghosts
hang
around
into
the
aftertaste
some
red
apple
accompanies
hop
bitter
is
gentle
and
clean
of
grassy
and
coho
hop
flavor
is
lemony
and
light
winterfresh
malt
sweet
is
definitely
wheat
gluteny
aftertaste
has
a
bit
metallic
light
body
and
mouthfeel
with
strong
carbonation
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
just
to
let
you
know
i
just
paid
7
49
for
a
six
pack
less
than
a
year
later
damnit
saranac
used
to
be
the
route
for
a
decent
microish
tasting
brew
for
less
price
than
a
micro
now
its
only
50
cents
cheaper
than
a
sam
adams
the
delicate
taste
and
clean
finish
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
for
beerdrinkers
and
nonbeerdrinkers
alike
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
nice
thick
head
but
little
lacing
given
the
name
i
wonder
if
presenting
it
with
a
few
fresh
pomegranate
pieces
wouldnt
help
similar
to
some
blueberry
ales
aromatics
are
weak
with
hops
but
not
insulting
pomegranate
is
present
but
not
over
bearing
plus
a
good
balance
of
hops
malt
and
barley
not
to
mention
some
airy
notes
of
wheat
and
yeast
for
good
measure
smooth
and
with
an
even
finish
it
drinks
quickly
a
good
all
around
beer
and
not
prohibitively
expensive
as
some
other
brews
i
found
this
a
nice
reminder
of
what
summer
was
and
will
be
pours
a
nice
straw
color
with
very
little
head
and
little
lacing
it
has
a
nice
crisp
and
malty
scent
to
it
but
with
little
in
the
way
of
a
fruit
scent
the
pomegranate
does
come
through
in
the
taste
although
not
very
strong
it
does
add
a
nice
little
fruit
zip
to
a
good
wheat
beer
they
go
down
very
easily
worth
a
shot
especially
if
you
like
fruited
wheat
beers
as
the
pomegranate
is
pretty
neat
very
refreshing
beer
especially
if
you
like
pomegranates
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
with
a
a
very
light
tint
of
pink
it
has
a
very
sweet
smell
of
wheat
and
pomegranate
the
taste
is
just
as
good
very
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
the
right
mix
of
wheat
and
pomegranate
makes
it
really
refreshing
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
crisp
fresh
mouthfeel
and
good
clean
aftertaste
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
cant
wait
for
next
summers
batch
the
sweetness
limits
this
beers
drinkability
poured

cloudy
bronzecopper
color
with
a
nice
slightyly

head
that
stayed
a
while
aroma
was
fruity
and
malty
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
fruit
with
a
bit
of
tartness
i
was
afraid
this
one
might
be
too
sweet
but
wasnt
moutfeel
was
good
carbonation
was
soft
not
too
bad
i
enjoyed
it
overall
not
an
incredible
beer
but
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
brews
as
for
my
random
thoughts
if
your
looking
to
taste
a
lot
of
fruit
get
a
wine
cooler
if
you
want
lots
of
hops
get
an
ipa
but
if
you
want
a
flavourful
wheat
beer
with
just
enough
fruit
to
give
if
good
flavour
and
stay
in
balance
this
is
what
your
looking
for
it
certainly
delivers
on
its
promises
this
beer
will
certainly
make
it
to
my
fridge
every
summer
from
this
year
forward
pours
a
dull
gold
hue
with
a
slight
orange
tint
creamy
one
figner
head
shows
decent
retention
and
a
few
wisps
of
lace
weak
bouquet
some
mild
sweet
fruit
and
faint
pale
malt
aroma
sweet
tworow
and
wheat
malt
upfront
followed
by
mellow
grainy
taste
and
a
blast
of
tart
fruit
puree
flavor
the
fruit
taste
does
not
seem
distinctly
pommegranate
but
provides
a
dark
and
savory
berry
flavor
albiet
a
somewhat
processed
and
bruised
character
the
afteratste
shows
some
very
lightly
spicy
wheat
yeast
phenols
like
clove
and
bubblegum
as
well
and
a
faint
light
caramel
taste
a
low
but
balancing
hop
bitterness
rounds
out
the
sweetness
along
with
the
tart
fruit
and
touch
of
yeasty
spice
the
sediment
particles
provide
a
little
more
texture
to
a
light
body
and
when
matched
with
a
medhigh
carbonation
a
mouthfeel
with
an
acceptable
creaminess
is
achieved
while
the
overall
flavor
profile
is
varied
and
arguable
complex
all
the
flavors
are
uniformily
mild
and
some
pleasent
nuances
are
so
background
that
the
louder
fruit
character
overshadows
the
tamer
yeast
and
malt
notes
the
finish
is
clean
and
drying
and
allows
a
terriffic
drinkability
because
there
is
no
lingering
fruit
skin
or
tannic
bite
an
advantage
this
beer
has
over
many
other
fruit
beers
drinkable
and
better
than
expected
pours
a
cloudy
orangeish
color
with
a
white
head
aromas
that
are
fruity
and
a
dry
sweetness
characteristic
in
the
taste
dry
and
fruity
i
am
assumming
pomegranate
a
fruit
i
cannot
say
i
have
had
it
also
has
a
small
tartness
a
small
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
a
sweet
fruity
aftertaste
it
was
quite
nice
with
the
pomegranate
a
small
tartness
yet
a
but
syrupy
drinkability
no
problem
knocking
this
sixer
off
while
getting
some
valuable
antioxidants
to
boot
honestly
im
rather
impressed
the
last
wheatfruit
combo
i
had
was
a
bit
disappointing
this
however
was
not
a
unique
but
nice
refreshing
beer
the
taste
is
fruity
with
the
pomegranate
coming
trough
nicely
also
has
some
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
wheat
this
one
is
very
drinkable
d
no
question
able
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
a
quality
beer
imo
light
and
tangy
mouthfeel
couldnt
get
past
the
syrupy
feel
knocked
down
the
drinkability
not
very
pleasing
like
a
wheat
beer
should
be
saranac
usually
makes
a
decent
and
affordable
beer
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
part
of
the
twelve
beers
of
summer
sampler
pack
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
frosty
pint
glass
not
much
of
a
head
on
this
one
but
appearance
is
nice
gotta
love
the
wonderful
wheat
ale
aroma
mmm
taste
is
well
above
average
for
this
style
having
been
disappointed
with
fruit
beers
in
the
past
this
one
surely
pleases
the
pomeganate
flavor
is
there
but
stays
in
the
back
where
it
should
very
drinkable
this
is
a
definite
session
canidate
which
is
rare
for
a
fruit
brew
no
sickening
sweet
going
on
here
hello
sams
cherry
wheat
as
far
as
the
sampler
pack
goes
the
hefe
was
ok
the
belgian
white
was
average
the
kolsch
was
excelent
but
this
one
takes
the
blue
ribbon
another
fine
brew
from
a
fine
brewery
finish
is
slightly
spicy
or
peppery
good
drinkability
due
to
how
well
balanced
it
is
drinkability
is
average
didnt
have
to
pour
it
out
not
sure
what
the
point
of
this
is
adding
fruit
juice
to
the
fermentation
why
there
are
some
great
weissbiers
out
there
that
stand
on
their
own
without
any
juices
added
and
some
great
fruit
beers
made
with
genuine
whole
fruit
imo
this
is
an
experiment
that
shouldnt
have
made
it
past
the
pilot
batch
state
i
had
this
on
tap
at
mister
motos
in
burlington
ia
the
appearance
was
hazy
golden
orange
thin
2finger
head
i
dont
know
what
pomegranate
smells
like
but
after
this
beer
i
have
an
idea
it
was
a
very
nice
contrast
with
the
hefeweizen
yeasty
esters
fruity
and
a
little
sweet
a
very
easytodrink
beer
i
had
a
couple
d
this
isnt
bad
it
could
be
overpoweringly
sweet
but
it
isnt
i
sample
it
after
mowing
my
lawn
and
it
was
perfect
for
such
an
occasion
decent
wheat
beer
kind
of
a
let
down
w
a
name
like
a
pomegranate
wheat
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
attempt
of
pomegranate
but
ended
up
tasting
more
like
cherry
and
orange
overall
this
was
excellent
and
so
far
my
favorite
of
the
mixed
pack
i
could
drink
this
fairly
regular
and
thought
it
was
a
great
addition
to
the
lineup
look
forward
to
having
another
pours
a
hazy
golden
slightly
amber
color
with
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
but
leaves
only
bits
of
spotty
lacing
aromas
are
mild
all
around
smells
like
a
weizen
a
bit
yeasty
some
hints
banana
and
clove
but
with
some
faint
fruity
notes
namely
as
the
name
indicates
pomegranate
the
taste
like
the
smell
is
quite
mild
very
weizenlike
with
the
previously
mentioned
flavors
but
with
a
slight
pomegranate
flavor
that
takes
control
and
is
dominate
but
still
not
overpowering
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
lightmedium
body
with
lowmoderate
carbonation
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
is
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
having
another
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
cloudy
medium
amber
with
a
one
finger
head
ok
longevity
and
ok
lace
not
much
aroma
but
i
do
get
a
bit
of
malt
fruit
abd
citrus
taste
is
watered
down
i
get
some
malt
and
a
grapefruit
like
bitterness
it
is
spritzy
and
easy
drinking
a
good
hot
weather
beer
but
not
a
full
flavored
one
usually
when
i
sample
beers
for
review
i
do
all
the
tasting
last
but
it
was
late
i
poured
this
one
and
had
a
few
swallows
and
this
would
be
a
beer
i
could
reach
for
every
day
its
nothing
special
but
the
pomegranate
it
smoothed
the
taste
and
made
this
like
an
amber
beer
with
a
sweetness
of
honey
and
bitterness
of
sour
fruit
it
was
almost
average
but
something
stuck
out
maybe
it
was
the
overall
swallow
of
the
beer
that
made
this
stick
out
like
a
dessert
beer
like
something
that
you
treat
yourself
too
rather
than
drink
regular
id
get
this
again
it
was
that
unique
and
familiar
pours
a
cloudy
light
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
and
a
small
amount
of
lacing
pomegranate
aromas
in
the
nose
taste
pomegranate
mixes
nicely
with
the
wheat
malt
and
yeast
nice
fruity
taste
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
and
carbonation
is
good
very
enjoyable
summer
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
i
like
pours
a
three
finger
thick
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
fruity
nose
flavor
is
smooth
some
fruity
sweetness
pomegranate
slight
tart
finish
good
summer
beer
1
50
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capitol
convenience
concord
nh
not
bad
for
a
runofthemill
fruit
wheat
beer
which
it
prettymuch
is
at
least
it
doesnt
have
the
syrupy
or
artificial
taste
that
some
fruit
beers
have
overall
light
and
refreshing
wheat
ale
the
pomegranate
was
subtle
which
was
probably
a
good
thing
finish
was
decent
and
as
it
turns
out
this
is
about
the
only
saranac
beer
ive
tried
so
far
that
that
i
might
actually
buy
again
overall
a
bit
underwhelming
but
not
bad
as
such
pretty
good
beer
this
is
the
first
pomegranate
beer
ive
had
it
poured
a
golden
body
with
a
reddish
tint
decent
white
head
with
ok
retention
does
pretty
well
holding
with
the
beer
there
was
really
nothing
to
the
smell
of
the
beer
maybe
a
slight
sweetness
the
taste
had
nothing
really
in
it
either
kind
of
a
bitter
sweetness
that
held
throughout
the
beer
but
nothing
too
impressive
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
fullbodied
the
beer
is
nice
and
light
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
summer
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
with
a
little
bit
more
of
a
taste
the
beer
was
refreshing
though
d
easy
not
much
at
all
hinders
the
drinkability
here
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
from
ol
saranac
saranac
pomegranite
wheat
pours
a
hazy
amberorange
body
with
a
brass
cast
beneath
a
solid
head
of
creamy
white
froth
the
retention
is
good
and
it
leaves
short
splashes
and
streaks
of
lace
about
the
glass
the
nose
displays
the
typical
matt
yeast
and
wheaty
malt
base
with
a
subtle
hint
of
apricotlike
fruit
the
flavor
however
displays
more
fruitiness
and
the
pomegranite
is
discernable
but
without
the
tart
quality
normally
found
its
well
balanced
and
fairly
drinkable
interesting
and
enjoyable
but
not
particularly
exciting
a
great
beer
for
backyard
barbeques
camping
trips
and
picnics
da
after
really
enjoying
the
amazing
sam
adams
longshot
boysenberrywheat
ale
not
that
long
ago
ive
come
to
respect
these
fruit
beers
on
a
new
level
overall
refreshing
is
its
best
quality
light
and
refreshing
but
not
something
i
would
regularly
seek
out
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pomegranite
scent
laid
over
a
mild
wheat
and
pale
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
light
and
refreshing
wheat
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
nice
pomegranite
touch
its
like
most
saranac
beers
its
a
bit
middle
of
the
road
but
it
drinks
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
its
nothing
over
the
top
but
it
goes
down
easy
thats
the
key
especially
during
these
warm
summer
months
md
a
soda
like
fizziness
denies
this
beer
smoothness
but
gives
it
some
life
on
the
palate
not
a
great
beer
but
neat
to
try
once
had
it
at
the
ct
beer
fest
was
a
bit
better
there
maybe
it
just
needs
to
be
colder
drinkability
nice
and
refreshing
the
fruitiness
is
not
offensive
and
this
was
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
give
it
a
shot
somewhat
subdued
in
the
first
taste
and
not
as
sweet
as
i
feared
it
is
refreshing
but
the
texture
is
watery
and
cant
hold
up
the
taste
somewhat
flat
and
lifeless
in
the
mouth
hatte
to
say
it
but
this
is
typical
saranac
tease
you
with
a
nice
appearance
and
nose
and
let
you
down
when
it
really
matters
drinkable
but
so
are
hundreds
of
beers
ill
avoid
in
the
future
unless
free
notes
while
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixpack
for
myself
this
bottle
came
in
the
saranac
summer
sampler
12pack
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
for
the
ladies
in
the
summer
drinkability
great
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
head
dies
out
very
quickly
light
carbonation
aroma
is
fruity
pomegranate
is
noticeable
with
a
light
yeast
note
flavor
follows
suit
creamy
fruit
is
not
overbearing
aftertaste
is
lightly
of
fermented
fruit
but
does
not
stick
around
long
i
think
they
got
this
one
right
nice
and
refreshing
not
over
the
top
or
syrupy
like
some
fruit
beers
drinkability
i
could
see
finishing
this
one
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
but
am
not
really
a
wheat
person
so
wont
be
going
back
again
saranac
can
keep
hookn
me
up
with
their
imperial
ipa
though
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
as
i
find
pomegranate
to
be
a
very
interesting
flavor
addition
though
i
had
never
before
tried
it
in
a
beer
the
beer
fell
far
short
of
my
expectations
though
as
this
wheat
brew
is
a
weak
addition
to
the
saranac
line
up
pours
out
a
light
gold
with
a
finger
of
head
and
no
lacing
nose
contains
some
light
maltiness
along
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
the
spice
continues
onto
the
tongue
but
overall
the
taste
is
very
light
and
i
would
consider
weak
mouthfeel
was
decent
but
this
was
overshadowed
by
the
watery
taste
of
the
beer
not
recommended
not
having
much
of
a
pomegranate
background
except
through
bible
references
i
took
my
chance
on
our
deck
memorial
evening
my
wife
tells
me
they
are
also
called
chinese
apples
and
are
rather
expensive
one
wonders
how
saranac
could
afford
to
brew
them
into
a
sampler
pours
an
effervescent
orangebrown
haze
fizzing
head
reduces
to
small
tracings
citrus
notes
with
acidic
appeal
all
is
working
for
this
brew
until
the
chew
which
really
is
like
chewing
bark
or
some
sort
of
forest
timber
the
taste
mellows
unchallenging
but
leaving
a
lingering
juicelike
aftertaste
really
not
my
thing
as
authentic
lambics
guezes
and
saisons
handle
the
fruit
realm
with
much
more
authority
this
beer
is
surprisingly
better
than
i
expected
it
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orangy
and
slightly
reddish
color
with
minimal
lacing
and
some
head
the
smell
is
definitely
sweet
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
pomegranate
in
there
i
would
have
guessed
at
some
other
fruits
the
taste
is
very
subtle
sweet
and
light
no
doubt
on
the
pomegranates
and
maybe
some
other
slight
fruity
bits
as
well
the
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
very
light
on
the
alcohol
a
little
more
malty
than
hoppy
but
this
is
clearly
a
summer
time
refreshing
beer
that
you
could
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
got
this
one
cause
it
was
something
id
never
heard
of
before
so
why
not
pours
a
lighter
amberlight
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
on
top
that
dissolves
pretty
quickly
nose
is
very
mild
a
hint
of
fruit
grape
maybe
and
a
touch
of
wheat
taste
is
fairly
similar
only
a
little
stronger
pomegranate
which
seems
to
be
a
fairly
mild
smooth
fruit
comes
through
first
and
is
pretty
tasty
however
aside
from
some
wheat
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
there
feel
is
average
medium
body
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
for
a
change
although
its
not
one
id
want
to
drink
that
much
da
decent
and
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
i
probably
couldnt
have
more
than
a
few
of
these
though
due
to
the
fruit
if
you
like
ffruit
beers
this
is
a
good
choice
i
am
noting
that
the
three
i
have
tasted
so
far
are
all
differenrt
variations
on
the
same
theme
pours
a
pale
color
with
some
lacing
the
aroma
isnt
impressive
at
first
consisting
of
some
fruitiness
mixed
in
with
the
malt
the
taste
is
the
opposite
as
theres
more
of
a
sweet
mix
of
pomegranate
and
wheat
that
seems
to
interact
in
some
way
the
end
result
is
a
bit
sweet
and
hard
to
differentiate
mind
you
ive
never
had
a
beer
with
pomegranate
flavors
not
too
bad
but
feels
somewhat
offbalance
an
ok
beer
but
not
a
great
one
and
one
i
need
never
try
again
pass
the
wheat
definitely
gives
a
dry
bready
feel
its
a
decent
fruity
beer
decent
but
really
nothing
amazing
best
probably
for
nonbeer
drinkers
pours
a
clear
light
copper
with
a
slight
touch
of
redness
an
average
white
head
that
did
not
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
hard
to
detect
i
really
cant
pick
up
anything
the
taste
has
a
nice
wheat
backbone
with
a
nice
touch
of
pomegranate
though
if
i
didnt
know
this
was
a
pomegranate
brew
i
would
not
be
able
to
tell
what
fruit
flavor
it
has
the
feel
is
well
carbonate
crisp
and
light
a
very
drinkable
summer
beer
no
offensive
or
cloying
flavors
overall
a
good
light
beer
i
would
like
to
see
some
thicker
beers
of
this
style
out
there
though
cheers
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
underwhelming
sweet
notes
from
the
fruit
with
some
wheat
characteristics
the
taste
isnt
very
strong
but
the
flavors
are
balanced
extremely
well
the
sweetness
doesnt
overpower
the
wheat
or
dominate
the
beer
yet
it
adds
a
unique
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
great
for
a
summer
beer
this
one
is
a
very
easy
drinker
and
wouldnt
get
annoying
like
some
fruit
beers
after
one
worth
checking
out
enjoy
d
very
drinkable
beer
good
seasonal
offering
from
saranac
a
refreshing
interesting
pale
wheat
good
for
the
novelty
and
the
summer
season
this
is
a
very
respectable
easy
to
drink
fruit
beer
in
the
same
vein
as
the
boysenberry
wheat
offering
from
sam
adams
part
of
the
longshot
series
this
is
better
flavors
of
a
nice
light
tongue
tingling
wheat
are
coupled
with
the
sweetness
of
what
i
can
only
imagine
is
fresh
pomegranate
juice
neither
dominates
the
other
rather
they
come
together
in
harmony
for
a
very
enjoyable
experience
this
is
a
nice
lawnmower
ale
perfect
since
the
weather
is
starting
to
turn
towards
summer
good
brew
from
saranac
highly
drinkable
spring
time
choice
now
lets
add
the
pale
ipa
and
some
others
brews
and
make
this
a
real
12
beers
of
summer
very
drinkable
perfect
summer
afternoon
beer
this
beer
is
from
the
12
beers
of
summer
pack
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldorange
color
with
an
inch
white
head
which
goes
away
quick
it
smells
like
wheat
and
a
bit
of
fruit
but
the
aroma
is
light
it
tastes
like
wheat
and
some
pomegranate
luckily
the
pomegranate
flavor
is
light
and
not
overwhelming
and
its
not
light
enough
where
you
cant
taste
it
the
fruit
flavor
is
done
right
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
little
bit
watery
but
it
is
crisp
drinkability
is
good
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
its
a
decent
refreshing
beer
that
has
just
the
right
amount
of
fruit
flavor
to
make
it
good
and
drinkable
not
bad
hot
day
drinking
hazy
golden
orange
small
white
head
shrinks
to
a
soapy
film
before
too
long
softly
fruity
aroma
dusted
with
a
light
sweetness
reminds
me
of
mhs
9
in
its
character
sweet
fruitiness
sticks
to
the
grainy
wheat
for
a
moment
before
giving
way
to
a
lingering
cereal
quality
not
too
sweet
or
syrupy
but
at
the
same
time
not
too
light
or
watery
fairly
crisp
and
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
things
moderately
interesting
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
knocking
back
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
saranac
that
ive
had
but
seeing
how
i
didnt
think
too
highly
of
their
winter
selection
thats
not
saying
a
whole
lot
this
is
worthy
a
try
for
the
novelty
factor
of
the
pomegranate
and
for
the
relatively
cheap
price
of
the
6pack
beyond
that
its
like
most
of
their
other
beers
light
watery
and
lacking
in
complexity
it
pours
a
light
cloudy
amber
with
a
little
bit
of
white
head
that
left
bits
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
red
fruit
obviously
but
its
also
got
some
yeastiness
and
a
light
herbal
hop
tastes
a
little
candyish
up
on
the
front
end
of
the
taste
but
the
tartness
of
the
pomegranate
and
a
dry
finish
on
the
beer
actually
work
well
to
make
you
want
that
next
sip
or
that
next
bottle
overall
quite
bland
not
worth
the
2
i
paid
for
a
12oz
um
so
yeah
pours
an
amber
type
color
with
a
white
headskie
but
um
where
do
we
go
from
there
taste
is
nice
and
smooth
but
nothing
wonderful
not
well
drinkable
or
mouthfelt
at
hand
alas
saranac
has
yet
another
subpar
brew
on
their
hands
well
i
think
spring
has
sprung
here
in
western
ny
so
i
picked
a
beer
to
go
along
with
the
warmer
weather
theme
poured
into
weizen
glazz
a
dull
hazed
peachy
color
with

with
toasty
dry
almost
leafy
finish
although
my
wife
loves
the
beer
its
not
a
girly
beer
it
has
subtle
complexitya
decent
offering
from
saranac
better
than
expected
drinkability
im
a
pom
guy
so
i
was
very
interested
in
this
taste
great
would
buy
again
even
though
it
is
a
very
small
percent
of
pom
juice
in
it
i
would
think
it
is
the
beer
that
is
good
for
you
brew
pours
to
a
cloudy
orangegolden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
broke
down
very
quickly
and
only
left
a
trace
of
lacing
the
aromas
seem
to
be
mostly
wheat
with
a
sweet
smell
that
i
suppose
would
be
the
fruit
mixing
with
the
malt
the
fruit
smell
to
me
does
not
scream
pomegranate
but
is
nice
i
think
what
i
like
the
most
about
it
is
that
it
is
not
in
your
face
seems
to
be
just
playing
along
with
everything
the
flavors
are
also
nice
very
east
drinking
with
a
crisp
feel
you
pick
up
a
slight
wheat
flavor
which
lead
to
semisweet
flavor
that
seems
to
be
from
the
juice
no
bitterness
that
i
can
pick
up
i
am
not
usually
a
fruit
beer
drinking
person
but
this
brew
is
not
to
bad
i
can
see
this
being
a
cheap
easy
refreshing
summer
brew
and
i
will
get
this
one
again

before
i
tried
this
brew
i
thought
i
would
never
say
that
d

overall
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
offering
between
the
loud
bottle
design
and
promise
of
a
fruitier
drink
this
one
fails
to
deliver
much
of
a
memorable
taste
as
a
pale
wheat
its
middle
of
the
road
as
a
fruit
beer
its
lackluster
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
overall
it
was
a
refreshing
summer
beer
this
one
is
nice
however
tastes
light
and
crisp
the
pomegranate
is
there
but
not
overpowering
the
brew
is
also
not
overly
sweet
another
common
flaw
of
fruited
beer
nice
beer
not
one
that
i
would
drink
lots
of
but
very
drinkable
i
think
its
a
tremendous
appearance
the
smell
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
subtle
loved
the
taste
but
i
prefer
a
more
subdued
fruit
beer
as
a
rule
so
someone
who
likes
to
get
hammered
by
a
sweet
taste
may
be
disappointed
nothing
spectacular
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
but
ill
buy
it
again
ephemere
it
is
not
but
a
light
very
drinkable
wheatnfruit
it
is
im
pleasantly
surprised
that
one
of
saranacs
wilder
creations
came
out
well
im
definitely
going
to
stash
some
for
hot
summer
days
i
will
be
getting
this
again
cant
say
as
ive
ever
had
anything
like
it
before
drinkability
saranac
did
a
really
nice
job
with
this
beer
the
pomegranate
flavor
was
there
but
it
still
tasted
like
beer
unlike
some
beers
that
taste
like
a
5050
mixture
of
fruit
juice
and
beer
this
is
a
nice
summer
time
beer
well
worth
a
try
pours
a
cloudy
golden
thin
head
not
much
retention
decent
lacing
smell
is
of
honeyand
orange
spice
smell
is
nice
but
weak
body
is
light
to
medium
and
carbionated
taste
is
of
spiced
fruit
again
nicebut
a
bit
weak
this
beer
is
not
among
the
greats
but
well
worth
a
try
this
summer
one
of
the
better
fruit
beers
because
the
fruit
isnt
overpowering
its
just
nice
this
beer
centers
around
the
pomegranate
some
fruit
beers
you
know
its
just
fruit
extract
you
know
overly
sweet
and
not
very
drinkable
this
one
however
is
a
nice
middle
ground
if
you
like
a
little
fruit
in
our
beer
give
it
a
try
