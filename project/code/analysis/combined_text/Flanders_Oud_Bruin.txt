tastes
like
your
favorite
flanders
red
but
a
little
bit
thinner
and
papery
nice
cherry
pleasant
tart
was
a
2012
bottle
enjoyed
early
2015
2010
consumed
in
2015
benefited
beautifully
from
age
mellow
tannic
still
a
great
cherry
presence
subtle
funky
o
very
good
rendition
of
a
wild
ale
but
perhaps
i
should
have
aged
it
to
give
it
funkunique
character
as
it
was
enjoyable
but
middling
as
far
as
toptier
sours
go
tart
cherry
faint
wine
presence
and
belgian
funk
a
very
good
sour
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
bit
too
much
brett
character
for
me
when
fresh
the
aroma
is
sweet
floral
and
somewhat
subtle
flavor
is
phenolic
with
a
respectable
sour
quality
five
years
aging
increases
the
sourness
considerably
revealing
an
acetic
acid
dominance
with
floral
hops
highlighted
in
the
aroma
i
had
the
2012
vintage
of
this
beer
overall
probably
just
a
bit
too
lactic
forward
for
its
own
good
the
tasty
cherries
and
wine
barrels
are
a
bit
drowned
out
by
the
sourness
towards
the
end
for
me
funkyness
and
sours
are
well
done
however
appearance
is
a
blend
of
hazy
orange
red
and
brown
with
a
candy
hue
finger
of
head
after
a
moderate
pour
head
remains
throughout
the
majority
of
the
drink
and
leaves
a
few
lace
lines
on
the
glass
intense
acidic
aroma
mostly
berries
nice
touch
of
oak
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
begins
with
a
heavy
dose
of
acetic
acid
imparting
berry
vinegar
and
cider
notes
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
cherry
flavor
mid
drink
finishes
dry
with
a
gentle
touch
of
wine
and
oak
to
mellow
out
the
flavor
medium
body
and
bonedry
feel
with
ample
carbonation
perfect
mouthfeel
i
dont
even
know
where
to
begin
with
this
beer
it
seems
that
every
big
purchase
i
make
on
a
new
sour
ale
turns
into
a
home
run
and
this
one
is
a
grand
slam
so
much
depth
and
complexity
yet
super
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
just
an
all
around
stellar
beer
on
tap
at
fleur
in
las
vegas
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
on
tap
for
6
because
i
thought
750s
were
like
22
must
be
the
only
good
deal
in
vegas

big
sour

and
light

that
lasts
from
initial

can
taste
dark
cherries
wild

and
wood
medium

sour
but
with
a
touch

had
22

fairly

very

to

on
with
the

a
highly
enjoyable
offering
this
is
probably
the
most
actually
sour
sour
beer
i
have
had
from
goose
island
reminiscent
of
rodenbach
very
very
good
d
a
fantastic
flanders
and
a
great
start
for
me
into
this
style
simply
magical
much
so
that
i
really
found
no
flaws
here
i
dont
understand
why
this
one
doesnt
score
higher
in
the
ratings
the
balance
of
everything
was
in
perfect
harmony
for
me
perhaps
the
2
years
of
aging
has
done
this
one
proper
i
think
i
would
gravitate
towards
the
madame
over
quite
a
few
other
wilds
like
say
rr
supplication
or
cantillon
rose
de
gambrinus
would
have
this
one
over
and
over
again
if
i
could
permawant
o
looking
forward
to
the
next
bottling
of
this
to
see
how
much
cherry
there
is
when
its
fresh
pours
a
light
reddish
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
sweet
and
sour
and
a
bit
oaky
inviting
and
quality
funky
aroma
in
the
taste
nice
acetic
sourness
and
plenty
of
depth
to
it
as
well
a
solid
base
beer
is
behind
the
sourness
with
sugar
plum
cherry
and
berry
notes
this
plays
nicely
with
the
oak
and
the
sour
everything
is
in
good
balance
and
the
flavor
really
pops
body
is
medium
and
semi
dry
with
a
lingering
sour
note
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
american
wild
or
flanders
red
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
kriek
lambic
not
a
surprise
due
to
the
michigan
cherries
employed
here
good
to
savor
every
sip
overall
another
wellexecuted
barrelaged
beer
from
goose
island
ill
keep
my
eyes
peeled
for
more
after
my
recent
experiences
with
this
and
sofie
o
if
you
love
sour
beers
and
if
you
love
cherries
this
is
a
good
beer
for
you
everyone
else
should
stay
away
this
is
a
bold
take
no
prisoners
kind
of
beer
with
a
lot
of
personality
a
top
notch
flanders
that
has
very
distinct
flavor
pours
a
deep
ruddy
color
with
light
head
that
quickly
faded
to
light
lacing
the
nose
is
so
complex
expected
tart
vinegar
components
but
also
loads
of
cherries
and
fruit
as
well
a
musty
bready
component
is
there
as
well
love
just
holding
my
nose
over
the
glass
flavors
are
spectacular
and
i
feel
is
far
superior
than
previous
batches
long
sweet
cherry
finish
that
outlasts
the
zippy
sour
flavors
that
hit
up
front
great
brett
component
as
well
i
really
like
this
and
think
the
overall
score
is
not
doing
it
justice
at
over
25
a
bottle
i
found
this
to
be
quite
good
but
not
necessarily
worth
the
money
the
aroma
is
great
but
i
wanted
more
layers
in
the
flavor
profile
like
more
fruit
and
belgian
brown
characteristics
cyrus
another
great
sour
sours
have
never
been
my
thing
but
fortunately
due
to
some
generous
folks
im
diving
right
in
and
trying
some
of
the
best
on
the
market
overall
super
expensive
but
worth
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
i
thought
this
was
a
great
example
of
a
sour
or
american
wild
ale
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
it
was
pretty
sour
but
it
didnt
seem
too
acidic
and
the
complexity
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
a
little
mouth
puckering
not
too
acidic
pretty
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
great
job
of
holding
my
attention
it
was
sour
but
the
flavors
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
and
i
think
this
would
be
an
awesome
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
nice
summer
afternoon
i
think
one
bottle
would
be
my
limit
and
its
a
good
beer
to
split
but
it
tastes
so
good
ill
have
no
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
how
true
to
style
and
complex
it
was
its
just
what
i
want
in
a
good
sour
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
wasnt
bad
but
the
head
and
lacing
could
have
been
a
little
better
but
it
wasnt
that
big
of
a
deal
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
i
will
be
trying
hard
to
track
down
some
of
the
new
batch
and
i
would
love
to
try
this
fresh
and
have
a
couple
for
the
cellar
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
like
tart
and
sour
beers
i
think
its
a
must
try
and
im
glad
a
friend
recommended
it
to
me
thanks
ben
all
in
all
i
was
very
happy
with
this
beer
and
i
was
also
a
little
impressed
this
is
one
well
crafted
beer
and
it
really
came
through
in
almost
all
aspects
of
this
beer
im
glad
i
traded
for
this
beer
and
so
far
i
think
its
right
up
there
with
juliet
and
lolita
as
my
favorites
from
this
series
ans
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
so
far
this
made
for
a
great
beer
to
mark
900
reviews
and
somehow
im
going
to
have
to
find
a
way
to
go
even
bigger
for
my
1000th
review
great
job
guys
this
was
one
fantastic
beer
keep
up
the
awesome
work
id
like
to
try
this
one
fresher
i
feel
that
the
fruit
has
fallen
off
and
there
is
some
oxidation
there
is
also
more
acetic
acid
than
i
prefer
probably
common
for
the
style
the
finish
is
a
little
short
and
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
however
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
the
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
is
excellent
and
it
is
very
sessionable
this
one
is
worth
a
try
but
if
you
are
saving
this
i
would
drink
it
now
overall
pretty
nice
great
souring
bacteria
mix
nice
dark
soured
malts
blended
with
a
fresher
malt
nice
balance
of
the
malt
vinegar
and
regular
malt
flavors
with
nice
cherry
and
a
great
barrel
balance
and
flavor
very
tasty
overall
a
very
very
good
not
so
sour
sour
style
beer
the
cherries
and
brett
combine
to
provide
a
very
unique
flavor
profile
for
the
style
i
think
this
one
was
probably
more
tart
and
sour
when
it
was
fresh
but
by
no
means
has
this
beer
dropped
off
its
just
aged
gracefully
o
too
simple
to
be
a
worldclass
offering
but
this
still
hits
the
sour
taste
buds
like
a
champ
i
imagine
this
would
be
more
balanced
read
more
cherryforward
fresh
id
certainly
buy
it
again
to
find
out
good
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
really
jumped
up
a
grabbed
a
hold
of
me
the
best
oud
bruin
ive
ever
had
if
we
can
even
fairly
call
it
that
and
easily
the
most
enjoyable
brew
from
goose
island
for
me
including
a
few
bourbon
county
variants
special
beer
here
more
red
than
brown
in
color
fairly
light
and
see
through
with
soda
like
carbonation
and
an
inch
or
less
of
off
white
fizz
head
the
nose
on
this
is
awesome
bretty
as
funky
as
it
is
sour
the
cherries
are
authentic
but
not
too
sweet
the
base
beer
is
true
to
style
and
the
cabernet
barrels
have
left
their
mark
with
a
fruity
tannic
kick
i
also
smell
something
uniquely
floral
vegetal
flowers
lush
and
in
bloom
the
flavor
of
this
beer
blew
me
away
my
favorite
in
a
long
lineup
of
excellent
beers
i
do
get
the
oud
bruin
malt
profile
but
its
dressed
up
in
tart
cherries
as
bright
as
day
and
mellowed
with
a
refined
oak
profile
that
includes
vanilla
and
all
kinds
of
brett
charcter
its
sour
sure
but
not
too
acidic
like
some
can
be
its
only
a
gentle
sour
drying
but
not
burning
elegant
beer
i
also
get
the
floral
thing
in
the
flavor
like
biting
the
head
off
a
fresh
bright
red
tulip
its
vibrant
and
wet
and
the
embodiment
of
captured
sunlight
this
beer
is
so
complex
so
layered
so
intricately
put
together
that
its
bringing
me
all
the
way
back
to
the
first
time
i
had
consecration
im
not
sure
i
have
been
as
impressed
with
a
beer
since
i
could
not
imagine
a
better
flavor
profile
or
feel
the
cherries
the
brett
the
cab
barrels
its
all
so
well
done
i
will
remember
this
bottle
fondly
for
a
long
time
and
eagerly
await
the
opportunity
to
drink
another
one
this
was
the
last
in
a
night
of
maybe
25
beers
and
it
was
so
darn
good
it
made
me
sober
mind
blown
o
im
really
disappointed
with
this
beer
goose
islands
juliet
is
one
of
my
favorite
sours
so
my
expectations
were
rightfully
high
for
this
one
its
like
a
watered
down
soureddown
la
folie
which
i
believe
is
an
almost
perfect
example
of
this
style
it
may
have
been
the
age
almost
1
5
years
since
bottling
that
caused
the
cherry
flavor
to
seriously
fade
i
think
this
one
is
better
fresh
based
off
its
current
score
of
a
98
here
on
ba
no
hard
feelings
i
still
love
you
goose
island
cheers
o
a
notch
below
some
of
the
better
sour
beers
ive
had
o
a
pleasant
sour
pretty
good
overall
big
cherry
notes
and
nice
oak
undertones
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
more
sour
dissident
the
body
was
medium
to
light
with
modest
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
nice
mix
of
flavors
but
malt
severely
lacks
to
complement
the
tartness
for
this
style
othis
is
a
very
good
almost
great
sour
beer
the
smell
is
especially
inviting
and
complex
and
the
feel
is
very
wellsuited
for
the
style
the
taste
is
also
nice
but
a
touch
on
the
acidic
side
which
hurts
drinkability
that
criticism
aside
this
brew
is
on
par
with
la
folie
and
one
of
the
best
oud
bruins
out
there
dry
and
oaky
finish
with
only
remnants
of
cherries
and
vinous
grapes
thinmedium
bodied
with
a
pretty
smooth
mouth
feel
that
turns
sharp
in
the
end
thanks
to
some
hefty
carbonation
another
very
solid
release
from
goose
islands
line
of
belgian
style
ales
id
like
to
see
a
little
more
sourness
for
the
price
but
overall
the
beer
itself
was
very
enjoyable
i
feel
like
a
few
years
of
age
could
take
this
one
in
a
positive
direction

well
worth
seeking
out
very
good
tart
cherry
taste
was
able
to
take
care
of
a
bomber
myself
without
hating
the
tartness
at
the
end
while
the
smell
was
hard
to
get
the
taste
was
right
on
opened
it
eleven
months
after
the
bottling
date
and
it
was
excellent
even
though
i
have
had
it
only
this
once
i
recommend
a
year
aging
overall
a
fine
easy
drinking
flanders
style
beer
with
some
nice
real
cherry
flavour
not
too
sweet
like
too
many
of
the
style
overall
pretty
solid
puckering
beer
tart
barnyard
bready
oakey
and
delicious
tastes
a
tart
black
cherry
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
very
similar
to
a
merlot
with
the
tart
after
taste
the
tartness
is
not
overwhelming
and
they
found
a
good
balance
that
allows
you
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
madame

is
the

shes
crafty
imaginative
and
regal
in
her
recipe

and

execution
shes
perfect
even
in
her
flaws

not
as
good
as

and
drinkable

overy
flavorful
with
good
balance
between
malt
and
tartness
overall
a
musttry
for
sour
fans
not
falling
into
this
category
myself
its
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
especially
at
its
relatively
hefty
price
point
which
im
not
sure
it
lives
up
to
still
its
a
very
nice
beer
worth

i
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
i
guess
i
didnt
really
realize
what
it
was
an
outstanding
beer
tart
but
not
oppressive
cherries
brett

dark

i
would
like
more
of
this
overall
very
tasty
and
pretty
authentic

nice

and
a
well
blended
cherry
flavor
o

a
really
nice
american
example
of
a
flanders
oud
bruinflemish
red
that
borders
on
experimental
with
the
addition
of
wisconsin
cherries
to
be
honest
i
am
just
getting
into
sours
now
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
which
excited
my
interest
to
further
explore
the
style
with
other
belgian
and
american
examples
its
a
very
nice
drinkable
sour
and
tart
cherry
based
beer
it
was
so
sour
and
tart
to
keep
your
tastebuds
entertained
it
wasnt
so
sour
that
you
made
a
sour
pucker
face
every
time
you
took
a
sip
a
winner
from
goose
island
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
was
given
another
chance
update
on
32615
just
drank
a
2012
vintage
bottled
the
same
date
as
the
above
bottle
the
aromas
have
drastically
changed
to
more
sourtartlactic
and
the
taste
is
more
complex
just
as
sour
but
more
balanced
age
did
this
one
very
well
would
rather
drink
rodenbrach
grand
cru
for
the
price
bottle
poured
a
hazy
reddish
color
ale
with
a
large
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
tart
cherries
notes
with
some
oak
notes
clearly
identifiable
with
some
funky
yeast
strain
notes
also
perceptible
taste
is
quite
tart
with
cherries
and
oak
notes
mixing
together
very
well
with
a
funky
yeast
notes
finish
body
is
about
average
with
good
spritzy
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
easily
drinkable
with
good
restraint
on
the
acidic
notes
with
loads
of
complexity
othere
are
some
real
similarities
between
this
and
supplication
it
doesnt
age
as
well
but
hit
hard
up
front
in
the
some
way
good
stuff
o
really
sad
that
i
only
have
one
more
bottle
of
this
little
piece
of
gi
infection
perfection
i
gotta
grab
some
fantastic
goat
and
sheep
cheese
to
pair
with
this
one
on
the
next
go
round
absolutely
stunning
thanks
blueokie
for
the
opportunity
o
not
bad
but
mot
something
i
would
go
for
again
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
tan
head
on
top
the
head
fades
not
leaving
any
lacing
or
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
tart
with
cherries
and
has
a
subtle
sweetness
as
well
as
plenty
of
oak
barrel
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
tartsour
there
is
a
good
amount
of
cherry
in
the
mix
the
flavors
are
a
little
medicinal
at
times
but
it
could
be
much
worse
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
a
sharp
carbonation
the
beer
is
dry
overall
its
a
pretty
good
flanders
worth
trying
if
the
price
is
right
o
a
fairly
good
flanders
brown
is
always
and
exceptional
beer
when
i
can
get
my
hands
on
one
this
one
is
somewhat
above
average
for
the
style
and
like
that
isnt
too
sweet
which
is
with
the
style
just
not
my
preference
this
beer
could
definitely
age
well
and
id
probably
enjoy
it
even
more
in
a
year
or
two
d
this
was
a
great
oud
bruin
it
had
a
delicate
and
complex
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
a
bit
weak
but
it
was
really
easy
to
drink
age
or
drink
fresh
recommended
a
fixture
upon
the
nouveau
craft
cherries
some
contained
sourness
and
well
balanced
a
masterpiece

smooth

a

with
dessert
poured
into
the
glass
madame
rose
was
a
little
darker
than
i
would
have
suspected
for
a
flanders
it
was
a
fairly
dark
brown
with
a
sour
aroma
little
head
was
produced
by
this
one
as
would
be
expected
for
the
style
in
the
initial
taste
one
can
detect
bitter
cherry
dry
tartness
grape
skin
and
tart
cherry
hints
at
the
back
of
the
throat
towards
the
end
the
sour
notes
linger
in
the
aftertaste
but
are
quickly
brushed
away
in
the
aftertaste
by
the
carbonation
i
never
really
detected
much
of
the
barrel
aging
in
this
one
it
seemed
more
like
a
flanders
with
more
intense
cherry
notes
it
is
a
better
than
average
interpretation
of
the
style
o
moderately
funky
with
some
nice
cherry
tartness
to
it
the
barrel
is
nicely
integrated
and
it
leaves
a
nice
array
of
grape
and
oak
in
the
background
o
an
excellent
sour
beer
definitely
an
acquired
taste
and
a
sipping
beer
overall
this
is
phenomenal
a
must
try
for
any
sour
fan
was
very
fortunate
to
get
a
bottle
of
it
and
hopefully
you
can
be
too
will
seek
this
out
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
is
not
as
sour
or
cherryforward
as
i
anticipated
but
it
does
fit
the
weirdness
i
would
anticipate
from
an
oud
bruin
damp
musty
and
bizarre
im
curious
what
a
fresh
bottle
would
be
like
fortunately
i
have
one
a
nice
blend
of
tart
and
juicy
fruit
sweetness
oak
is
a
bit
heavy
in
the
long
run
but
it
doesnt
really
hurt
it
as
i
stated
above
i
have
no
experience
with
this
style
but
it
doesnt
seem
too
much
different
to
me
than
a
flanders
red
a
great
mix
of
sour
and
sweet
flavors
with
some
red
wine
notes
and
oak
character
to
top
it
off
and
although
this
is
a
great
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
just
based
on
the
price
but
a
great
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
o
med
body
sour
beer
overall
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
would
drink
again
bottle
date
73112
poured
11913
pours
very
dark
red
with
a
bit
of
brown
and
nearly
no
head
smells
of
sour
cherries
and
vinegar
as
it
should
yum
very
much
vinegar
on
the
flavor
with
a
robust
and
creamy
flavor
i
am
not
familiar
with
for
this
style
finishes
dry
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
for
the
style
but
it
works
and
i
like
it
another
nice
one
from
gi
2012
bottle
poured
into
tulip
glass
pours
a
deep
red
almost
purple
with
a
thin
light
head
that
quickly
disappears
aromas
contains
an
acidic
cherry
tastes
less
of
cherries
than
the
aroma
lets
on
still
a
lot
of
tart
character
little
malt
with
a
bit
of
funk
to
it
moderately
carbonated
that
tickles
the
nose
overall
a
solid
gi
brew
but
not
quite
up
to
par
as
her
other
two
sisters
this
is
a
delicious
and
unique
but
very
onesided
beer
i
was
expecting
onesidedness
but
not
this
much
vinegary
sourness
since
the
bottle
only
indicated
that
it
was
belgianstyle
and
not
that
it
was
a
sour
i
consider
that
to
be
very
pertinent
information
and
am
baffled
as
to
why
they
wouldnt
mention
it
i
like
the
vinegary
unripe
cherry
flavour
though
o
for
me
the
best
part
of
this
is
the
smell
quite
good
i
think
the
taste
needs
the
most
work
it
doesnt
stand
up
the
smell
in
complexity
i
would
not
buy
again
at
the
18
a
bottle
price
definitely
preferred
last
batch
to
this
one
but
perhaps
my
memory
is
just
playing
tricks
on
me
cheers
this
is
one
of
the
more
rare
beer
reviews
from
beerandraiderfan
as
this
review
is
being
written
immediately
after
consuming
said
beer
this
new
years
eve
2012
what
can
i
say
everyone
of
drinking
age
isnt
drinking
anymore
in
the
end
its
a
pretty
good
and
enjoyable
beer
how
many
more
will
i
continue
to
get
a
hold
of
i
dunno
theres
one
or
two
still
in
the
cellar
it
costs
a
little
to
get
it
shipped
here
and
its
about
the
same
price
as
oude
tart
so
prolly
not
much
but
it
doesnt
mean
this
isnt
a
quality
beverage
here
man
o
i
thought
it
was
just
an
average
oud
flanders
but
was
still
good
and
worth
the
try
o
slightly
one
dimentional
although
i
do
enjoy
the
tart
cherry
flavor
madame
rose
is
a
relatively
tame
sour
worth
trying
this
once
but
the
17
pricetag
is
a
bit
steep
for
what
you
get
here
good
shit
o
a
solid
sour
cherries
taste
great
not
much
barrel
flavor
and
a
steep
price
but
otherwise
good
stuff
o
madame
rose
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
would
gladly
purchase
another
bottle
do
this
is
an
accomplished
easydrinking
sour
ale
that
compares
well
to
other
similar
american
wilds
its
most
distinct
quality
is
not
from
the
barrel
or
the
fruit
but
from
the
brettanomyces
yeast
that
dominates
the
smell
a
complex
combination
of
other
appropriate
qualities
are
present
but
overall
rather
restrained
the
flavor
profile
is
particularly
delicate
russian
river
supplication
it
is
definitely
not
overall
what
we
like
best
about
this
brew
was
how
smooth
it
drank
for
how
sour
of
a
punch
it
packs
you
could
drink
this
all
day
unlike
many
of
the
style
which
may
kill
your
palate
and
become
a
bit
much
by
the
end
of
a
serving
this
guy
keeps
things
fresh
and
smooth
to
the
end
with
robust
sourness
to
the
nose
and
taste
but
without
going
overboard
in
that
same
vein
the
cherry
flavoring
gave
only
mild
sweetness
to
the
back
of
this
beer
this
was
both
good
and
bad
as
we
wish
that
it
had
a
bit
more
of
that
advertised
flavor
but
are
thankful
that
they
didnt
overdo
it
overpowering
the
otherwise
excellent
flavoring
perfect
balance
between
the
sourness
cherries
wine
and
oak
really
nicely
put
together
this
is
an
excellent
oud
bruin
o
this
is
a
a
delightful
beer
drinking
experience
the
sourness
is
very
well
balanced
this
is
one
of
goose
islands
better
sour
offerings
mdo
definitely
needs
some
time
i
love
sour
beers
but
this
one
was
a
bit
different
for
some
reason
the
cherry
flavor
was
exquisite
but
sour
needs
to
fade
just
a
bit
for
the
cherries
to
come
to
full
power
o
this
puppy
needs
more
time
the
flavors
havent
progressed
all
that
much
and
everything
seems
very
bland
and
young
picked
up
a
bottle
at
the
whole
foods
down
the
street
from
churchkey
after
zwanze
day
poured
into
dfh
tulip
with
a
bit
of
head
that
leaves
a
slight
lacing
around
the
edge
very
nice
dark
burgundy
in
the
light
smell
is
wonderful
reminds
me
of
oude
tart
a
lot
tart
at
first
with
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
a
little
at
the
end
taste
was
a
little
hard
to
get
into
i
wasnt
too
keen
on
the
cherries
at
first
but
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
they
really
started
to
shine
glad
i
picked
up
a
bottle
will
definitely
drink
again
if
i
can
find
more
o
a
solid
flanders
brown
with
plenty
of
the
sour
and
funk
that
goes
with
the
style
the
cherries
and
wine
barrels
are
both
nice
subtleties
that
make
this
beer
nice
and
complex
overall
this
is
kind
of
a
let
down
its
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
has
some
great
qualities
but
it
feels
like
something
is
missing
nothing
more
i
can
say
o
this
beer
has
just
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
the
astringency
that
grows
odd
with
the
chalky
note
i
do
love
this
style
but
this
one
was
a
bit
lack
lust
especially
for
the
price
the
cherry
flavor
was
good
but
it
didnt
have
a
lot
of
other
flavor
in
the
mouth
in
the
end
this
beer
reinforces
my
opinion
that
goose
island
can
make
a
pretty
bottle
but
cant
quite
pull
off
belgian
styles
overall
the
price
18
kills
any
chance
of
me
buying
this
again
since
there
are
better
more
affordable
options
the
beer
pours
a
dull
dark
brown
with
almost
no
head
except
a
thin
tan
halo
around
the
edges
the
beer
smells
slightly
acidic
but
is
also
fruity
oaky
and
buttery
the
sweet
cherries
pack
a
bigger
punch
than
expected
cutting
down
dramatically
on
the
beers
mild
tartness
the
taste
plays
out
the
same
except
for
providing
a
touch
more
oak
and
vinegar
its
definitely
a
tasty
oud
bruin
that
yanks
on
the
standard
subtle
cherry
characteristics
of
the
style
and
makes
them
a
true
asset
to
the
beer
the
aftertaste
is
mildly
drying
almost
negligible
by
comparison
and
leaves
little
flavor
lingering
its
sweet
body
is
cut
by
a
mild
tartness
but
there
very
little
brett
funk
maybe
its
weakness
is
that
its
a
bit
too
mild
or
possibly
served
a
bit
too
cold
regardless
its
redlined
drinkable
reasonable
pricedavailable
and
made
by
the
lovely
ab
inbev
who
have
never
messed
up
a
beer
before
22
ounce
bottle
bottled
on
7312012
served
in
a
unibroue
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
brownishred
color
with
about
a
half
inch
light
tan
head
head
stayed
around
for
a
bit
but
there
isnt
much
lacing
aroma
is
mostly
tart
the
brew
smells
like
tart
cherries
wood
red
wine
and
vinegar
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
the
addition
of
some
vanilla
and
caramel
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
its
also
smooth
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
but
it
is
pricey
at
15
99
a
bottle
pours
a
very
opaque
brown
with
a
decent
sized
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
a
bit
funky
with
some
dark
sugars
and
a
lingering
sweetness
theres
a
solid
shot
of
tart
cherries
and
lactic
aromas
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
vinegar
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
a
little
brown
sugary
up
front
but
that
changes
rapidly
lactic
tart
and
bready
funk
come
in
right
away
to
sweep
out
and
residual
sweetness
tart
cherries
and
lemons
are
faint
flavors
but
they
are
there
amid
a
hint
of
oak
and
vanilla
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
nice
american
sour
but
i
think
it
needs
a
little
time
in
the
bottle
for
everything
to
come
together
a
little
better
this
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
carbonated
head
that
reminds
me
more
of
a
cola
than
a
beer
the
scent
is
rich
with
yeasts
and
fermented
cherries
initially
the
taste
of
yeasty
fruit
hints
you
taste
buds
with
a
complex
blend
of
ingredients
as
the
taste
develops
it
grows
into
this
sweet
tart
taste
that
lingers
in
you
mouth
well
past
the
swallow
interesting
certainly
high
end
in
taste
but
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
in
the
realm
of
new
glarus
belgian
red
since
this
is
almost
twice
as
much
in
cost
overall
a
really
bright
and
fruity
sour
upfront
that
falls
off
after
the
initial
fruit
tones
a
little
sour
but
that
too
fades
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
but
the
finish
seems
too
clean
and
bland
good
not
great
o
with
a
little
bit
of
time
this
could
be
really
awesome
will
possibly
get
more
sour
and
that
with
the
presently
great
showing
of
fruit
oak
and
subtle
earthy
funk
will
really
drive
this
one
home
only
time
will
tell
o
a
very
solid
flanders
oud
bruin
very
subtle
and
simple
with
nice
strong
cherry
notes
and
lactic
acid
working
off
of
some
really
great
barrels
id
put
this
in
the
middle
when
it
comes
to
three
sisters
though
overall
i
think
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
with
that
being
said
i
wouldnt
be
afraid
to
buy
more
have
a
feeling
this
one
could
go
the
distance
in
a
cellar
if
stored
properly
o
this
is
a
great
brew
it
actually
has
a
nice
lasting
flavor
where
as
while
juliet
was
great
the
flavor
drops
quick
this
is
a
great
oud
bruin
seek
this
beer
out
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
my
kate
snifter
dark
reddishbrown
pour
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
vinegary
lots
of
cherry
notes
it
is
pleasanty
tart
lots
of
cherries
very
vinous
drying
finish
it
is
slightly
acidy
nice
sipper
refreshing
enjoyable
brew
glad
iwas
finally
able
to
try
it
o
if
you
like
american
sour
beers
you
have
to
try
this
at
least
once
o
wow
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
by
goose
island
so
glad
to
try
it
dark
fruits
and
bread
soured
cherries
oaky
wine
barrel
character
pretty
good
taste
given
that
im
typically
a
cynic
of
the
style
enjoyable
but
cant
compare
to
juliet
the
price
point
did
not
bother
me
as
this
was
gifted
by
a
really
good
friend
but
i
would
definitely
buy
again
the
beer
pours
a
deep
candied
brown
with
light
ruby
hints
to
it
and
a
light
eggshellwhite
head
on
top
that
fades
quickly
leaving
little
to
no
lacing
the
body
of
the
beer
is
dark
and
opaque
leaving
one
to
guess
what
might
be
inside
of
it
though
little
carbonation
bubbles
can
be
seen
dancing
to
the
top
of
the
glass
on
the
nose
the
beer
has
some
great
sour
cherry
notes
that
hint
at
fruit
leather
and
vinegar
and
heavily
remind
me
of
the
bruerys
oude
tart
light
notes
of
brown
sugar
and
bready
malt
can
be
picked
up
but
are
really
faint
in
comparison
to
the
sour
cherry
light
spices
can
also
be
found
in
the
sour
smell
the
initial
sip
of
the
beer
begins
with
prickling
sour
that
opens
into
big
cherry
and
leather
fruit
notes
before
hinting
at
fruitrollups
towards
the
end
of
the
middle
and
closing
out
as
a
faint
sour
tingle
the
taste
is
actually
surprisingly
simplistic
and
im
really
just
getting
a
lot
of
cherry
sour
with
faint
hints
at
the
wine
barrels
that
the
beer
sat
in
the
taste
is
lighter
and
less
mouth
puckering
than
other
sours
i
have
sampled
which
makes
this
beer
more
acceptable
for
table
pairings
as
it
wont
ruin
the
tastes
of
the
food
as
it
warms
the
beer
also
bring
more
of
its
malt
character
into
play
and
though
it
is
still
light
it
hints
at
caramel
and
bread
notes
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
expected
though
i
think
that
is
actually
helpful
with
this
beer
especially
in
terms
of
making
it
a
table
pairing
beer
carbonation
is
quite
prickly
at
the
start
but
that
dies
down
to
just
leave
the
tongue
a
little
numbed
but
cleans
the
palate
the
mouth
is
actually
left
rather
neutral
after
the
beer
has
left
it
with
a
very
slight
sour
lingering
and
some
saliva
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
while
the
middle
sits
slightly
dry
yet
still
moist
overall
my
feelings
are
neutral
on
this
beer
i
have
not
had
an
oud
bruin
before
so
my
judgment
of
it
comes
more
from
the
flanders
red
style
which
is
supposed
to
be
similar
but
sourer
im
intrigued
with
how
the
beer
allows
for
more
pairing
options
with
lighter
food
but
really
the
beer
did
not
blow
me
away
a
lovely
sipper
and
i
great
for
the
table
but
nothing
overly
special
with
this
beer
89
b
would
be
higher
if
not
for
the
price
cost
20
for
a
22
oz
bomber
bottle
overall
i
did
not
like
this
beer
i
am
not
sure
if
it
the
style
or
this
brand
i
hope
to
try
another
brand
of
this
style
to
have
a
better
grasp
of
this
experience
there
is
sediment
on
the
bottom
so
i
will
most
definitely
purchase
another
and
age
it
proper
a
disappointing
beer
from
goose
island
tart
and
monotone
my
wife
dumped
hers
but
i
finished
mine
with
a
meh
upon
last
sip
rose
is
more
of
a
corner
pimp
than
a
madame
that
was
a
stretch
price
point
on
this
one
is
kind
of
high
and
i
would
have
thought
there
would
be
more
of
a
cherry
presence
in
the
taste
this
is
a
nice
one
to
give
a
try
though
overallwhile
i
can
see
that
some
are
disappointed
that
it
is
not
more
sour
or
that
the
cherries
dont
come
out
stronger
i
think
the
beer
is
fine
the
way
it
ishope
it
becomes
even
better
once
it
has
had
some
time
to
age
i
wish
i
had
a
whole
case
in
my
closet
instead
of
only
two
more
bottles
priced
slightly
high
but
still
worth
trying
light
to
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
with
the
nice
oak
flavor
and
aroma
coming
through
o
this
brew
was
rather
intriguing
as
soon
as
the
aroma
hit
the
nose
i
immediately
began
to
salivate
from
the
sourness
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
of
the
cherries
to
come
out
so
i
was
slightly
disappointed
in
that
but
nonetheless
this
is
an
excellent
sour
brew
imo
i
have
to
say
that
juliet
gets
a
slight
edge
as
my
favorite
of
the
3
sisters
but
this
is
an
extremely
close
second
another
excellent
offering
by
gi
o
very
wellbalanced
oud
bruin
very
drinkable
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
my
first
of
the
gi
vintage
ales
i
liked
it
a
lot
it
makes
me
wish
i
didnt
pass
up
the
bottles
of
juliet
when
they
were
on
the
shelf
id
definitely
grab
this
one
if
flanders
reds
are
your
thing
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
high
overall
it
was
a
really
good
beer
the
combination
of
the
cherries
and
the
wine
barrel
was
really
good
everything
came
together
very
well
and
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
really
good
version
of
the
style
as
well
odawesome
sweet
and
sour
to
the
max
balance
is
key
worth
every
penny
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
may
not
be
one
of
your
favorites
but
you
will
always
remember
it
could
be
my
favorite
goose
island
brew
though
yeah
it
is
2012
vintage
well
hadnt
seen
my
man
vdubb
and
his
lady
in
some
time
so
i
figured
id
bring
over
a
bottle
o
this
to
mark
the
occasion
it
pours
a
dark
fauxmurky
rubygarnet
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
offcream
foam
not
all
that
much
to
look
at
though
until
it
was
held
up
to
the
light
the
nose
comprises
dankslightly
tart
cherry
light
caramelmaple
syrup
i
couldnt
untangle
the
two
and
a
touch
of
general
earthiness
the
taste
holds
notes
of
sweeterthanusual
cranberries
light
tart
cherry
pit
light
earthy
greens
and
a
smattering
of
vague
sweetness
running
beneath
it
all
honestly
this
aspect
let
me
down
a
little
especially
considering
the
pedigree
of
her
sisters
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
but
one
that
just
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
there
was
hardly
any
appreciable
tartness
of
any
kind
the
cherries
came
through
somewhat
muted
even
transmogrified
at
times
and
the
whole
thing
came
across
as
just
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
and
mind
you
this
is
without
coming
across
as
sweet
in
any
absolute
sense
whatsoever
only
a
relative
one
based
on
the
styleexpectationswhatnot
its
still
generally
enjoyable
but
nothing
to
really
celebrate
too
much
o
a
nice
well
balanced
oud
bruin
with
nice
cherry
flavor
not
the
most
sour
or
the
most
complex
but
very
nice
tasty
and
drinkable
a
really
nice
american
flemish
beer
not
at
all
as
sweet
as
i
feared
o
one
of
the
styles
i
really
enjoy
i
find
this
beer
pretty
easy
to
drink
since
the
sourness
of
this
beer
is
not
overpowering
and
there
is
a
very
nice
cherry
flavor
as
well
very
enjoyable
and
certainly
one
i
would
have
again

very
good
flanders
that
has
just
a
great
balance
of
sour
and
sweet
biga
cherry
flavor
that
keeps
a
nice
tart
sour
flavor
this
is
good
stuff
and
something
to
try
the
funkiness
and
the
sour
cherries
make
this
a
treat
o
good
sour
id
go
for
another
but
personally
i
prefer
the
lolita
over
madame
not
to
mention
the
cost
thanks
egrace84
for
sharing
this
25
bottle
with
us
mediumlight
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
high
side
clean
and
crisp
drinking
refreshing
with
a
tannic
drying
finish
quite
good
medium
body
which
is
dry
very
tart
and
puckering
with
lots
of
earthy
funk
oak
barrel
and
sweet
fruit
prominent
tart
dark
cherry
but
still
sweet
with
lactic
funk
subtle
acetone
presence
at
first
that
becomes
a
bit
overpowering
with
a
powerful
lingering
vinegarysolvent
finish
a
bit
harsh
on
the
acidity
but
decent
amount
of
sweetness
and
oak
countering
things
this
had
the
potential
to
be
a
lot
better
but
the
acetic
solvent
character
is
just
too
strong
for
my
liking
pours
a
bright
cherry
red
color
workout
much
of
a
head
on
it
nose
is
cherries
vinous
character
sourdough
bread
taste
starts
with
cherries
that
move
to
a
citric
character
some
bready
malts
take
the
palate
next
and
are
overwhelmed
by
some
more
citric
cherry
flavors
mixed
in
some
vinegar
that
is
ultimately
drowned
out
by
a
lingering
vinous
flavor
really
nice
complexity
decent
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
would
pay
the
price
tag
again
for
it
but
wouldnt
say
no
pours
a
faded
hazy
mahogany
red
with
a
foamy
looking
bubbly
head
the
nose
is
ok
fair
bit
of
oak
with
light
vanilla
and
cherry
as
a
moderate
acidity
and
sawdusty
brett
flavor
is
similar
decent
acidity
in
the
finish
cherries
are
light
and
the
oak
is
still
most
prominent
with
a
fair
bit
of
vanilla
light
body
assertive
carbonation
semi
dry
finish
and
assertive
but
nice
sourness
decent
drink
closer
to
room
temp
balanced
but
a
touch
flabby
overall
a
beer
geeks
wet
dream
i
would
highly
recommend
pairing
this
beer
with
a
soft
stinky
cheese
as
the
tartness
cuts
through
that
buttery
cheese
like
a
champ
i
love
the
great
balance
that
is
maintains
as
is
ever
important
with
a
sour
beer
the
cherries
are
a
welcome
addition
and
i
think
it
would
also
do
wonders
for
a
cherry
dessert
like
a
torte
or
black
forrest
cake
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
sticky
and
dry
on
the
tongue
i
really
enjoyed
the
cherry
version
of
the
3
sisters
i
hope
to
have
this
again
eventually
o
a
decent
beer
easily
my
least
favorite
of
the
three
sisters
but
good
nonetheless
45
overall
the
medicinal
notes
are
somewhat
distracting
but
this
is
still
pretty
good
solid
beer
but
nothing
special
got
better
as
it
warmed
and
will
probably
seek
out
again
at
some
point
overall
gi
makes
another
really
nice
sour
i
think
that
i
like
lolita
a
little
bit
better
madame
rose
and
lolita
are
really
similiar
this
is
a
pleasant
sour
id
place
it
at
the
low
end
of
the
top
tiers
of
sours
thanks
elliot
the
beer
is
hazy
and
light
brown
in
color
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
pleasant
aroma
of
cherries
funk
yeast
oak
brett
character
comes
through
nicely
in
both
the
scent
and
flavor
bold
flavor
and
quite
tasty
with
prominent
oak
and
sour
cherries
light
bodied
with
moderately
low
carbonation
overall
a
solid
beer
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
and
would
certainly
have
it
again
recommended
o
madame
rose
is
a
solid
gi
offering
that
stands
up
to
the
other
sisters
i
feel
like
this
is
one
that
doesnt
get
as
much
credit
or
hype
as
juliet
or
lolita
but
is
just
as
good
drink
it
took
vince
a
while
to
land
this
3rd
sister
and
it
was
well
worth
it
i
hope
the
2
sisters
i
have
are
as
good
as
this
one
was
beer
is
light
in
body
but
has
depth
of
flavor
and
character
the
cherries
show
up
in
the
back
half
of
hte
mouth
and
finish
the
beer
nicely
there
is
a
minor
brightness
on
the
palate
from
the
organic
acids
i
enjoy
it
a
lot
finishes
with
a
lingering
tart
fruity
vineous
character
and
a
juicy
but
drying
goodbye
o
a
very
tasty
oud
bruin
its
really
cool
that
gi
is
making
such
a
great
sour
beer
id
love
to
have
this
again
sometime
but
25
a
bottle
is
a
bit
steep
and
probably
my
least
favorite
part
of
this
beer
cherry
graham
with
just
a
rim
of
foam
smells
like
cherries
some
lemons
some
oak
and
a
little
cabernet
character
taste
is
tart
with
cherries
some
nice
alcohol
burn
a
little
bitterness
and
a
little
vinegar
thin
with
sharp
carb
and
a
wet
finish
nice
it
is
not
overly
complex
very
clean
and
approachable
sour
it
drank
just
fine
out
of
my
gouden
carolus
goblet
bottle
1550
101010
pours
the
color
of
blood
on
mahogany
kind
of
a
reddish
brown
amber
with
an
offpink
head
that
shrinks
to
a
collar
and
leaves
a
little
lace
nose
is
buttery
oak
cherry
plum
strawberry
spice
dark
sweetness
brett
and
a
tiny
hint
of
leather
quite
nice
oak
seems
pronounced
but
still
blends
with
the
other
scents
taste
is
a
very
proper
mix
of
the
above
with
wood
and
cherry
shining
through
the
harmony
notes
of
cola
and
that
dark
spice
that
brett
can
carry
come
out
as
well
great
mix
of
sweet
and
sourtart
medium
full
body
that
has
a
slight
tickletingle
from
the
carbonation
not
prickly
though
long
tart
finish
overall
a
very
very
very
nice
oud
bruin
would
love
to
try
the
rest
of
the
group
madame
rose
is
a
lovely
lady
complex
oaky
and
brewed
with
just
enough
cherries
o
really
well
done
flanders
easy
drinking
with
the
right
amount
of
tartness
very
well
balanced
o
overall
a
very
good
flanders
style
beer
the
nose
is
great
and
full
of
tart
cherries
and
dark
fruits
the
taste
still
has
a
lot
of
cherries
too
though
not
as
sour
as
the
nose
easy
to
drink
and
would
definitely
like
to
have
again
a
really
nice
beer
i
will
buy
it
if
i
see
it
again
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
at
25
bucks
a
pop
i
cant
see
myself
buying
it
very
often
i
would
like
to
try
juliet
and
lolita
to
see
how
they
all
stack
up
do
drinkability
is
moderate
for
the
style
its
pretty
good
but
i
wouldve
liked
more
cherries
here
i
like
the
amount
of
barrel
i
get
here
though
o
note
my
comments
from
the
last
review
i
wanted
cherries
well
i
certainly
got
them
here
i
really
hold
this
beer
on
a
much
higher
pedestal
tasting
it
on
its
own
its
delicious
and
absolutely
worth
paying
nearly
1
per
ounce
4
o
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
oud
bruin
style
lots
of
character
plenty
of
uniqueness
well
done
gi
pours
a
ruddy
red
with
a
high
white
head
little
lacing
the
smell
is
vinegar
currants
toffee
the
taste
is
rich
currant
jam
toffee
long
tart
cidervinegar
finish
its
fizzy
and
light
all
in
all
a
pleasant
take
on
the
style
though
perhaps
a
little
more
sour
than
it
needs
to
be
o
fantastic
really
nice
to
see
gi
developing
into
one
of
the
better
breweries
in
the
country
imo
this
is
not
just
a
solid
effort
but
a
very
good
beer
excellent
use
of
cherries
their
flavor
is
the
star
but
does
not
detract
from
the
other
flavors
in
the
beer
wish
i
could
find
this
one
on
the
shelves
pours
a
hazy
cranberry
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
puffy
tan
head
that

funk
and
lots
of

i
am
not
really
getting
any
wine
in
the
smell
or
taste
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
earthy
and
sour
smells
and
tastes
nice
body
but
i
think
a
little
more
carb
would
be
good
i
love
how
the
fruits
tempers
the
sour

aspects
of
this
beer
drinkable
to
a

truly
delicious

overall
this

was
amazing
it
was
a
great
wellbalanced
sour
ale
that
met
all
of
my
expectations
overall
very
tasty
perfectly
sour
great
cherry
flavor
o
definitely
worth
trying
skål
overall
i
think
the
price
comes
into
play
its
pretty
good
but
not
25
good
of
the
3
sisters
all
of
them
are
great
in
their
own
right
but
this
one
least
fit
my
preferanceshigh
lactic
strong
brett
but
would
be
the
most
approachable
for
a
new
to
sour
beer
drinker
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
im
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
good
carbonation
nice
flavor
everythings
right
but
the
pricepoint
25
overall
this
was
pretty
good
but
i
do
not
have
a
reason
to
really
go
after
this
again
especially
for
the
price
there
are
better
options
o
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
awhile
and
was
not
disappointed
a
nice
tartness
but
nothing
requiring
antiacids
would
love
to
have
again
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
use
of
the
wine
the
flavors
went
together
very
well
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
impression
while
getting
the
last
bottle
a
current
trend
im
enjoying
lately
this
was
well
worth
the
cost
awesome
sweet
and
tart
oud
bruin
with
tons
of
complexity
easy
drinking
and
enjoyed
the
hell
out
of
this
one
hope
to
see
this
guy
again
even
though
its
so
limited
a
good
sour
beer
if
rather
expensive
worth
trying
once
though
its
smooth
and
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
great
sour
not
a
lesser
sweet
kind
of
tart
beer
without
smacking
you
in
the
face
dnot
sure
id
call
this
one
an
oud
bruin
but
what
do
i
know
a
very
complex
and
interesting
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
now
i
just
wish
i
could
get
a
bottle
or
two
more
of
this
one
the
beer
pours
an
orangeish
brown
color
with
a
small
but
well
retained
head
the
aroma
has
that
great
dirty
laundry
character
right
up
front
with
some
lingering
horseblanket
and
loads
of
cherry
aroma
the
beer
smells
mildly
sweet
but
the
flavor
is
fairly
dry
not
bracingly
so
but
it
is
dry
the
sourness
of
the
beer
is
the
most
dominant
trait
that
and
the
loads
of
cherry
flavor
the
beer
has
a
little
bit
of
that
cherry
pie
ie
with
the
crust
ala
new
glarus
belgian
red
showing
that
this
character
carries
well
into
a
nonsweet
fruit
beer
very
very
well
absolutely
delicious
had
this
one
during
the
we
want
the
funk
tasting
that
was
graciously
hosted
by
beermex2
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beermex2
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
group
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
yelloworange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cherry
fruit
and
slight
sour
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
cherry
tart
and
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
based
on
the
aroma
was
i
was
expecting
this
one
to
be
a
little
sour
but
instead
it
was
tart
this
was
a
nice
welcomed
surprised
as
it
worked
quite
well
with
the
cherries
in
this
one
while
this
brew
wasnt
very
complex
it
was
quite
good
with
what
it
had
as
everything
was
in
the
right
portions
definitely
worth
trying

jeff
o
very
tasty
beer
well
balanced
puckers
your
lips
love
the
cherries
and
the
oak
flavors
very
solid
sour
from
goose
island
overall
this
was
a
solid
sour
one
of
the
better
sours
from
the
night
easy
drinking
with
some
tasty
flavors
i
like
it
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
a
copper
red
color
with
a
slight
collared
white
head
very
nice
nose
of
cherry
vanilla
and
oak
light
mouthfeel
sweet
vanilla
cherry
flavors
upfront
with
an
underlying
sourness
but
not
mouthpuckering
at
all
somewhat
reminds
me
of
new
glarus
enigma
not
overly
complex
at
this
time
but
pretty
tasty
curious
to
see
what
some
time
in
the
bottle
will
do
to
this
o
this
is
a
unique
style
and
quite
enjoyable
would
try
again
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
sourness
isnt
too
strong
and
is
fairly
well
incorporated
into
the
overall
taste
dark
amber
red
color
with
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
brett
and
wild
yeastbacteria
with
a
hint
of
fruit
the
taste
is
tart
but
smooth
with
a
nice
sourness
and
sweetness
from
the
fruit
not
a
lot
of
funk
in
this
one
and
thats
a
good
thing
with
this
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
lively
overall
outstanding
wild
ale
i
like
my
wilds
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
and
this
one
delivers
excellent
o
well
this
was
better
than
the
dissident
for
sure
however
it
was
nowhere
near
being
a
great
fob
maybe
some
age
would
do
this
one
some
good
overall
a
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
contend
with
the
better
options
in
the
style
category
o
this
beer
was
a
real
treat
for
me
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
but
it
is
a
very
good
sour
great
cherry
flavor
with
some
nice
malt
notes
and
good
funk
4
5
overall
a
very
hohum
beer
belowaverage
for
the
style
points
for
a
cool
label
i
suppose
o
the
drinkability
here
is
good
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
great
flavor
i
could
drink
more
than
1
bottle
of
this
in
an
evening
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
i
would
buy
it
again
notes
the
cherries
take
a
back
seat
or
more
accurately
they
play
a
supporting
role
instead
of
dominated
the
palate
at
first
i
was
disappointed
because
i
was
hoping
for
more
cherry
flavor
but
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
i
find
this
to
be
a
wellmade
beer
with
great
integration
of
the
fruit
and
wood
not
my
favorite
but
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
worth
seeking
out
o
these
first
generations
of
sour
beers
from
goose
island
have
been
pretty
good
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
them
continue
to
improve
overall
this
is
my
second
sour
from
goose
island
and
i
will
admit
they
are
both
a
hint
underwhelming
i
do
admit
however
they
do
seem
to
be
improving
from
the
juliet
i
had
almost
a
year
ago
id
like
to
see
what
this
will
do
with
a
few
years
on
it
which
i
am
planning
on
doing
i
have
the
full
set
of
the
three
sisters
back
in
il
and
wont
be
opening
those
for
a
while
i
feel
still
a
solid
oud
bruin
interesting
beer
that
i
would
serve
with
apple
sausage
and
walnutstuffed
pork
chops
muddy
amber
with
red
highlights
the
small
head
dissipates
completely
after
a
short
time
nice
sweet
and
sour
cherry
aroma
fleshy
and
earthy
with
a
backing
of
earthy
brett
funk
thin
dry
body
pleasant
lactic
sourness
some
vinous
fruitiness
tart
cherry
finish
quite
mild
but
very
enjoyable
very
nice
wild
cherry
ale
not
very
complex
or
aggressive
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
wild
ale
i
found
the
serving
size
to
be
a
bit
much
would
much
rather
see
this
in
12oz
bottles
i
would
revisit
this
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
land
another
bottle
d
excellent
brew
from
goose
island
this
is
the
best
wild
beer
that
i
have
had
from
them
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
couple
more
this
week
drinkability
by
the
gallon
reviewed
from
notes
pours
a
nice
reddishbrown
with
a
good
white
head
with
nice
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
a
good
bit
of
oak
along
with
some
vibrant
cherries
and
a
bit
of
citrus
good
lactic
presence
throughout
the
flavor
is
equally
a
nice
with
the
fruit
really
coming
through
alongside
a
nice
complementary
oak
character
feel
is
slightly
tannic
with
some
sourness
and
a
dry
finish
really
drinkable
solid
hit
from
the
goose
d
easy
drinking
for
a
sour
but
only
if
thats
what
youre
into
this
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
oud
bruin
and
i
really
like
that
its
a
little
bit
more
on
the
sour
side
than
a
traditional
belgian
rodenbach
monks
cafe
etc
home
run
by
goose
island
i
will
be
trying
to
find
more
of
these
juicy
and
sour
cherries
distinctly
fruity
savory
dry
oaky
tannins
in
the
finish
a
distinct
cherry
pit
dryness
lingering
natural
cherry
in
the
aftertaste
ample
carbonation
it
becomes
creamy
after
the
initial
sourtangy
bite
light
and
spritzy
nice
for
a
wild
ale
less
so
as
an
oud
bruin
very
juicy
and
quenching
the
dryness
encourages
frequent
sipping
age
it
longer
to
develop
more
brett
character
blend
old
and
young
batches
this
will
be
a
winner
rodenbach
grand
cru
still
has
a
corner
on
the
market
though
md
medium
body
on
this
one
that
finishes
about
as
dry
as
a
beer
can
get
lots
of
carbonation
on
this
one
but
goes
well
with
the
dryness
super
easy
to
drink
if
you
dont
mind
the
palate
getting
sucked
dry
with
each
sip
and
the
simplicity
of
complex
ingredients
make
this
beer
a
treat
to
drink
d
wish
this
was
distributed
id
have
bought
a
case
d
very
tasty
with
the
alcohol
pretty
subdued
would
have
like
to
see
a
bit
more
of
an
appearance
from
the
cherries
being
that
its
brewed
with
it
d
smooth
and
clean
goes
down
smooth
d
so
easy
to
drink
i
loved
that
it
wasnt
sour
just
for
sours
sake
this
ones
about
balance
and
restraint
fab
o
interesting
beer
im
glad
to
have
another
bottle
on
the
way
to
age
so
i
can
see
what
happens
to
this
one
overall
very
pleased
with
this
and
happy
i
have
another
bottle
to
try
in
a
couple
years
at
this
point
its
nothing
outstanding
but
it
is
a
very
solid
oud
bruin
goose
island
has
certainly
taken
a
page
from
allagash
on
their
presentation
of
this
bottle
looks
nice
poured
into
a
rodenbach
glass
and
presents
itself
an
orangish
red
with
brown
around
the
edges
and
thin
white
ring
of
foam
that
leaves
no
lacing
sounds
better
then
it
looks
aroma
is
somewhat
muted
but
complex
vanilla

some
acetic
quality
and
light
hay
approach
the
nose
round
malty
body
backed
up
by
tart
cherry
and
slight
funk
but
more
acetic
a
little
vanilla
and
a
touch

i
could
drink
mounds
of
this
stuff
easy
to
drink
with
great
quafability
thanks
goose
island
an
ouid
bruin
style
aged
on
cherries
in
cabernet
barrels
to
quote
my
buddy
andy
theres
no
nose
on
this
rose
super
dry
with
a
funky
oak
and
peat
sourness
lovely
brettyanomyces
asserting
a
classic
belgian
flare
but
the
clean
flavor
remains
distinctly
american
this
is
quite
drinkable
i
can
foresee
this
becoming
better
in
a
few
months
once
the
tartness
opens
up
and
the
brett
kicks
in
more
dry
funk
this
beer
will
certainly
improve
in
all
aspects
i
cam
only
imagine
how
this
review
improves
in
a
few
months
pretty
good
beer
overall
fruitiness
could
be
intensified
a
bit
and
the
acidity
could
be
toned
down
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
glad
i
didnt
love
it
cause
then
id
have
to
try
to
find
some
more
d
this
is
solid
not
great
fairly
easy
to
get
down
but
wouldnt
seek
this
out
at
the
prices
it
is
at
another
stellar
beer
from
the
goose
island
vintage
reserves
what
strikes
me
most
about
this
beer
is
its
balance
everything
is
in
harmony
while
some
belgium
beers
of
this
style
demonstrate
more
complexity
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
more
pleasant
drinking
experience
unlike
the
juliet
i
would
be
more
comfortable
ageing
this
beer
as
i
think
the
secondary
characteristics
will
balance
nicely
with
the
fruit
this
isnt
bad
a
good
tasting
but
plain
oud
just
nothing
going
on
worthy
of
spending

pours
a
nice
dark
brownish
red
with
minimal

slight
aroma
of

nothing
intense
at
first
sip
i
am
surprised
as
this
was
a
brown
ale
it
has
a
nice
tangy
cherry
taste
perhaps
a
little
watery
not
too
much
fruit
not
too
much
sour
not
a
perfect
brew
seems
like
it
is
missing
something
just
not
sure
what
overall
tho
drinkability
is
excellent
worth
a
try
i
will
have
another
please
md
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
high
drinkability
is
good
all
in
all
this
is
not
a
good
brew
simply
put
ok
its
a
sour
and
i
know
i
am
not
the
best
judge
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
that
flavor
in
beer
however
trying
to
judge
without
bias
this
is
not
one
of
the
higher
end
sours
by
any
means
drinkability
is
excellent
exactly
what
a
flanders
oud
briun
should
be
this
is
a
near
perfect
concoction
of
fruit
sour
and
sweet
notes
that
is
not
overly
concentrated
or
overbearing
but
just
right
in
all
areas

biggest
problem
i
have
is
that
it
doesnt

variety
of
flavor
its
straightup
sour
but
a
sort
of
dirty
sour
with
a
bite

and
not

seek

medium
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
slightly
one
dimension
in
its
sourness
odi
enjoyed
rosso
e
marrone
it
is
sure
to
please
any
lovers
of
wild
ales
i
dont
i
will
get
to
try
this
again
but
would
absolutely
love
to
sit
down
and
nurse
a
whole
bottle
to
see
how
it
changes
with
some
warmth
o
sadly
not
what
i
wanted
it
to
be
a
good
lambic
impression
but
just
a
little
off
superb
blend
of
flanders
vinegar
fruit
lambic
and
brett
funky
feels
one
of
the
most
sour
brews
i
can
think
of
in
recent
memory
feels
like
a
great
mix
of
a
lambic
and
a
flanders
bruin
overall
honestly
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
i
figured
itd
be
good
but
its
great
id
be
hardpressed
to
find
a
better
oud
bruin
not
even
just
an
american
one
truly
phenomenal
i
want
more
pours
hazy
ruby
small
offwhite
head
and
decent
lacing
very
beautiful
in
the
glass
aroma
is
tart
lemon
oaky
cherry
vinous
funk
basement
flavor
is
initially
sweet
and
fruity
with
light
tartness
and
a
bit
of
oaky
astringency
dries
out
on
the
finish
leaving
oaky
and
vinous
notes
behind
medium
body
very
low
carbonation
o
good
flanders
ale
with
a
good
amount
of
tartness
and
not
a
ton
of
the
copper
and
blood
you
sometimes
get
with
a
flanders
thought
this
one
was
well
balanced
and
would
have
went
well
with
some
earthy
cheeses
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
sours
with
a
big
abv
and
this
is
really
no
exception
seems
to
clash
with
the
sourness
and
funk
a
bit
still
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
but
considering
the
price
tag
and
the
much
better
examples
out
there
i
might
pass
on
this
in
the
future
verdict
a
very
nice
american
interpretation
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
tart
and
tangy
but
not
sour
and
mouth
puckering
very
complex
and
rewarding
but
needs
body
i
can
only
imagine
how
wonderfully
this
will
age
a
very
good
beer
the
body
was
good
i
maybe
would
have
preferred
it
a
touch
more
full
but
it
was
still
nicely
solid
across
the
palate
the
beer
had
a
semidry
finish
with
the
tartness
lingering
drinkability
was
very
good
i
could
see
having
these
on
a
semiregular
basis
if
it
were
local
to
me
overall
an
excellent
brew
a
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
m
medium
body
dry
light
carbonation
this
is
a
really
well
balanced
beer
with
its
tartness
oak
and
sweetness
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
on
this
o
fantastic
brew
tart
dark
wet
flanders
oud
bruin
wineified
with
grape
and
vineyard
characteristics
splendid
felt
very
much
like
i
was
drinking
a
very
fine
winerare
ale
hybrid
overall
an
amazing
oud
bruin
a
must
try
for
any
sour
fan
complex
tart
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
really
nice
flanders
style
brew
with
the
grape
addition
shining
through
almost
like
it
was
a
wine
hybrid
really
nice
stuff
its
thick
for
a
medium
body
pretty
rich
and
with
some
depth
crispness
cuts
through
that
and
carbonation
is
at
a
good
level
and
just
a
little
foamy
at
times
oak
dries
it
out
a
little
as
well
as
the
vinous
nature
but
the
acidity
doesnt
thin
it
and
its
fairly
smooth
considering
all
in
all
this
is
fantastically
tasty
with
so
much
depth
o
this
wasnt
the
best
oud
bruin
that
ive
had
but
it
was
definitely
a
very
good
attempt
at
one
the
grape
must
made
a
nice
presence
combined
with
a
decently
balanced
cobwebby
funk
overall
however
the
tastes
just
didnt
appeal
to
me
as
much
as
other
oud
bruins
have
but
id
have
to
say
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
attempts
out
there
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
wish
i
had
another
to
see
what
a
couple
years
of
age
could
do
to
it
o
interesting
wild
ale
if
i
had
to
guess
i
would
think
the
carbonation
will
subside
over
time
making
this
even
more
wine
like
ive
got
a
few
bottles
to
test
theory
in
a
few
years
shared
a
bottle
with
my
wife
pours
red
a
deep
red
very
nice
the
nose
is
tart
apples
cherries
and
oak
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
not
over
the
top
in
the
sour
category
tart
and
slight
brett
funk
the
back
is
oak
and
a
nice
berry
flavor
my
wife
loves
this
beer
it
is
nice
o
a
very
tasty
sour
the
booze
is
literally
invisible
i
would
never
have
guessed
it
was
as
strong
as
it
is
captain
lawrence
has
really
been
hitting
the
acidity
perfectly
too
although
this
doesnt
have
the
same
level
of
complexity
as
cuvee
de
castleton
its
still
a
really
good
beer
o
a
nice
american
oud
bruin
more
mellow
than
id
like
im
a
fan
of
cl
sours
for
their
big
oak
and
acid
punch
hopefully
the
acidity
picks
up
on
this
one
over
time
o
a
nice
mild
oud
bruin
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
more
acidic
but
nonetheless
this
was
quite
pleasant
to
drink
had
the
2012
release
just
a
very
well
balanced
beer
great
tartness
with
an
excellent
grape
taste
i
am
hoping
this
ages
well
the
color
reminds
me
of
many
other
sour
type
beers
taste
sits
in
the
mouth
for
the
right
amount
of
time
without
leaving
any
aftertaste
great
beer
to
try
if
you
can
find
it
m
high
carbonation
medium
bodied
o
a
fruity
beer
with
a
great
sweettart
balance
and
some
oak
character
pairs
very
nicely
with
food
probably
a
great
compliment
to
a
rich
meal
an
excellent
sour
beer
that
is
well
worth
seeking
out
should
you
enjoy
yous
beer
a
bit
on
the
tart
side
its
not
so
tart
as
to
be
out
of
line
and
is
well
worth
consideration
as
a
classic
example
of
the
style
oa
great
sour
good
balance
and
funky
the
feel
is
ok
definitely
sharp
and
under
carbonated
in
some
ways
decent
body
to
it
overall
decent
beer
but
not
amazing
pretty
yummy
flanders
quite
true
to
style
great
vinous
notes
grape
skin
tannins
and
some
good
slight
grape
juice
notes
plus
some
earthy
wood
and
a
nice
vinegary
tartness
that
isnt
too
intense
1600
finally
seems
like
it
took
forever
between
1500
and
1600
o
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
considering
the
strength
upfront
there
is
a
sharp
acidic
tartness
but
that
fades
a
bit
as
the
beer
warms
up
the
beer
is
hazy
chestnut
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
audible
hissing
as
the
head
rapidly
fades
the
aroma
is
grand
offering
plenty
of
sourness
and
funk
with
prominent
yeast
fruits
caramels
bread
sharp
and
biting
feel
but
not
unpleasant
certainly
acetic
though
a
nice
beer
to
sip
and
savor
with
a
friend
or
two
double
digit
alcohol
is
disguised
quite
well
a
really
solid
beer
though
not
for
everyone
this
is
the
style
of
beer
that
i
love
and
while
captain
lawrence
got
it
right
from
the
flavor
to
the
smell
and
appearance
the
price
is
way
too
high
i
figured
id
try
it
as
it
is
locally
brewed
but
you
should
save
the
cash
and
buy
some
goudenband
or
monks
instead
trade

my
first

pours
a

dissipates

smell
is
very
sour
cherry
and
vinegar
beautiful
sour
cherry
flavor
with
dry
oak
and
a
hint
of
sour
grape
much
creamier
mouthfeel
than
i
have
had
from
a
sour
prickly
carbonation
and
a
long
lasting
sour
on
the
palate
no
abv
content
but
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
warmth
on
this
good
brew
just
a
great
beer
refreshing
and
crisp
with
a
restorative
dry
quality
that
is
wonderful
i
had
it
with
pizza
new
and
it
was
great
a
spicy
cheddar
aged
an
it
is
superb

all
seasons
and
reasons

the
aroma
well
tart
but
balanced
and
not
very
puckering
sour
cherries
red
wine
tolerably
acetic
not
too
woody
but
there
was
a
slight
leathery
quality
to
it
with
subtle
funk
undertones
and
maybe
even
a
dusting
of
cocoa
powder
from
the
use
of
some
darker
malts
id
assume
medium
body
moderate
to
low
carbonation
and
a
nice
drink
overall
o
excellent
beer
wish
i
had
more
overall
im
not
sure
ill
ever
fully
love
oud
bruins
even
though
i
love
most
sours
and
funky
beers
there
is
just
a
harsh
aspect
to
them
but
this
one
is
definitley
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
certainly
worth
a
try
o
a
very
good
oud
bruin
right
up
there
with
la
folie
for
sure
would
love
to
have
a
bunch
of
this
sitting
around
to
open
whenever
i
wanted
the
beer
is
still
quite
flat
and
has
a
significant
sweetness
compared
to
the
dank
dry
acetone
base
i
remember
there
is
also
a
bigger
wine
barrel
presence
and
bitterness
similar
to
an
iced
black
tea
different
beer
i
look
forward
to
laying
a
few
bottles
down
to
dry
out
and
age
o
very
unique
and
tasty
with
a
lot
of
depth
the
10
really
doesnt
make
itself
known
luckily
the
sourness
makes
you
sip
this
one
slowly
anyway
dry
and
cidery
grapes
and
acetic
acid
medium
bodied
not
all
that
funk
forward
or
complex
but
its
good
would
take
la
folie
or
a
similar
flanders
over
this
though
not
really
worth
the
extra
effort
to
seek
out
o
ive
never
had
an
oud
bruin
that
was
this
big
and
robust
but
it
drank
like
it
was
much
lighter
very
solid
and
glad
i
was
able
to
get
to
try
this
o
eh
nothing
special
out
of
balance

pours
a
murky

color
with
a
medium
white

that
diminishes
very
quickly
scent
is
very
inviting
lovely
red
wine
vinegar
and
nice
tart
aromas
with
some
tart
red
grapes
quite
funky
at
least
more
funky
than
i
was
expecting
the
brett
has
done
some
good
thing
for
the
nose
of
this
beer
very
sharp
tart
cherrygrape
aromas
with
a
good
amount
of
woodoak
lovely
nose
taste
is
just
as
nice
at
first
it
drinks
like
a
burguny
with
some
strong
somewhat
tart
dark
flavors
then
you
get
a
good
amount
of
sour
grapes
which
immediately
turns
to
cherry
sweetness
very
sour
vinegarlike
beginning
with
a
smooth
sweet
cherry
finish
lovely
oak
flavors
throughout
especially
in
the
center
of
the
palate
as
the
beer
warms
the
barrel
really
comes
through
with
lovely
oak
flavors
you
can
definitely
tell
this
is
one
of
the
higher
abv
sour
beers
but
would
never
guess
it
to
be
as
high
as
10
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
tingly
somewhat
puckering
carbonation
drinkability
is
scary
high
for
a
10
beer
overall
this
is
a
great
oud
bruin
beer
love
the
complexities
of
if
this
is
quite
an
excellent
beer
and
is
full
of
complexity
the
grapes
acidity
and
malt
sweetness
play
well
w
one
another
making
a
great
beer
tasty
and
intriguing
the
balance
of
cola
tartness
and
funk
is
out
of
control
a
real
winner
from
captain
lawrence
overall
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
there
is
nothing
special
about
it
its
super
balanced
which
i
usually
like
in
my
beers
but
for
the
limited
availability
i
was
expecting
it
to
pop
a
little
more
while
good
i
cannot
recommend
this
unless
this
style
is
your
absolute
favorite
and
you
need
to
try
every
example
you
can
find
there
is
just
nothing
special
here
for
me
to
need
to
revisit
anytime
soon
good
just
didnt
meet
my
expectations
o
rough
around
the
edges
but
i
actually
really
liked
the
flavor
gross
looking
beer
though
drink
i
cant
thank
chad
and
josh
enough
for
the
gift
for
being
a
trustee
this
beer
was
so
damn
good
layers
upon
layers
and
it
did
it
effortlessly
i
want
it
again
drinkability
i
havent
had
a
sour
in
quite
some
time
and
this
one
took
a
little
warming
up
to
id
sat
on
it
for
a
long
time
because
i
read
somewhere
that
at
the
time
of
its
release
and
shortly
thereafter
it
wasnt
drinking
as
good
as
batch
1
had
been
so
i
sat
patiently
on
it
for
over
two
years
but
with
no
point
of
reference
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
drinking
at

quite
a

along
with

not

but
not

in
my
opinion
between

become
a

to
the
glory
of

not
missing
another

thats
for
sure

definitely
could
have
used
some

not
bad
but
nothing
special
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
another
great
sour
from
captain
lawrence
just
a
ton
of
sour
red
grapes
and
dark
fruits
as
wel
as
brett
which
is
perfect
to
me
would
love
to
get
more
bottles
of
this
and
will
definitely
be
trying
to
go
up
to
cl
next
time
it
is
released
i
think
i
prefer
cdc
a
tiny
bit
more
than
this
one
but
this
is
probably
up
there
with
barrel
select
batch
1
as
the
second
best
cl
beer
ive
had
o
very
much
passed
its
prime
instadrainpour
overall
this
is
a
really
tart
sour
beer
the
taste
was
nice
and
smooth
given
the
abv
didnt
really
pick
up
any
alcohol
the
smell
took
this
down
a
notch
for
me
overall
brett
can
be
a
funky
proposition
i
wish
it
were
a
little
less
prevalent
here
as
its
slightly
distracting
otherwise
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
flanders
oud
bruin
and
an
experience
im
happy
to
have
had
overall
this
is
simply
delicious
o
yet
another
delicious
sour
that
is
out
there
the
abv
seems
a
bit
high
than
other
comparable
brews
however
the
added
abv
is
not
noticeable
d
another
great
sour
from
captain
lawrence
would
be
fun
to
see
how
this
ages
though
i
do
not
know
when
i
will
see
another
bottle
o
small
but
absolutely
perfect
doses
a
shining
example
of
the
of
the
american
wild
ale
im
relatively
new
to
sours
and
this
is
my
second
flanders
oud
bruin
the
first
being
petrus
aged
pale
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
more
effervescent
with
a
giant
head
once
i
got
past
the
appearance
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
wine
at
all
but
rosso
e
marrone
blends
the
taste
perfectly
in
a
great
sour
i
will
seek
this
one
out
overall
even
with
the
bracing
tartness
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
its
complex
and
delicious
for
those
who
like
this
style
which
has
additional
elements
above
and
beyond
a
flanders
old
bruin
especially
the
funk
big
thanks
goes
out
to
beeruser
for
sharing
this
one
during
one
of
our
weekly
tastings
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
hazy
redorange
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
grape
sour
tart
earthy
funky
and
must
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
vinegar
funk
earth
and
dark
fruit
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
one
was
definitely
complex
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
vinegar
in
this
one
added
a
very
nice
touch
when
coupled
with
the
funkyearthy
character
here
a
really
nicely
done
brew
that
im
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
overall
a
great
american
interpretation
of
an
oud
bruin
the
grape
addition
is
a
bit
over
looked
by
the
acidic
flavors
that
turn
into
more
of
a
tart
cherry
flavor
not
overly
complex
but
definitely
delicious
recommended
rosso
murky
brown
almost
orangevery
thin
head
sweet
tart
all
day
some
other
fruits
but
mostly
tart
delicsious
but
super
tart
very
good
very
good
well
crafted
with
a
balanced
body
overall
worth
checking
out
o
wow
i
love
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
flanders
and
oud
bruins
this
is
just
amazing
extremely
well
made
american
wild
ive
just
got
to
appreciate
the
amount
of
time
and
dedication
that
captn
lawrence
put
into
this
beer
this
is
going
back
onto
my
wants
list
this
beer
pours
with
a
cloudy
reddishamber
hue
to
the
body
and
a
dirty
white
foam
on
the
surface
the
aromatics
are
stocked
with
lots
of
raspberry
notes
some
dark
fruits
but
there
is
a
lingering
tart
smell
as
well
the
flavor
confirms
the
tartness
but
i
must
say
this
rivals
no
fruit
sours
that
i
know
i
must
say
that
i
rather
enjoy
this
white
grape
flavor
and
raspberry
plum
tartness
there
is
a
distinct
finish
here
in
my
mind
that
says
there
is
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
on
the
palate
honestly
i
feel
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
for
its
style
it
has
all
the
requirements
its
overall
extraordinary
because
it
carries
a
certain
je
ne
sais
quoi
enjoyable
and
i
would
seek
it
out
again
it
tastes
a
bit
more
complex
than
it
smells
grapes
coming
in
with
the
cherries
both
acidic
and
sweet
medium
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
i
was
very
glad
for
the
chance
to
try
it
thanks
again
mike
o
sours
are
not
my
go
to
style
and
i
am
a
bit
of
a
fish
out
water
trying
to
describe
them
but
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
drink
quite
complex
and
while
the
sourness
was
present
it
was
neither
overwhelming
nor
distracting
batch
3
ive
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
brew
for
some
time
now
it
pours
a
cloudy
amberauburn
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
raspberry
ruby
red
grapefruit
mandarin
orange
very
light
caramel
light
brown
sugar
red
grapes
blueberry
currant
cinnamon
nutmeg
and
light
white
vinegar
the
taste
holds
notes
of
sour
raspberry
green
apple
pomegranate
very
light
brown
sugarcinnamon
plum
and
vinegar
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
sticky
finish
overall
a
very
nice
brew
something
very
complex
and
interesting
to
drink
late
2010
opened
a
batch
2
bottle
and
it
was
completely
flat
and
had
these
weird
globs
floating
through
the
bottle
while
i
prefer
a
few
other
examples
of
the
style
this
has
attributes
of
an
oud
bruin
as
well
as
an
american
wild
a
subtle
originality
which
distinguishes
it
from
its
peers
making
an
oud
bruin
is
a
difficult
beer
it
is
hard
to
pull
off
in
general
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
one
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
thin
and
bright
acetic
and
tannic
very
nice
finish
mildly
dry
id
have
it
again
looking
forward
to
tasting
the
other
vintages
and
releases
overall
great
beer
love
the
wine
flavor
but
i
would
prefer
la
roja
and
a
few
others
in
the
flanders
and
bruinbrown
ale
style

d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
until
now
ive
never
really
been
impressed
by
cl
complex
throughout
with
great
flavors
and
a
killer
mouthfeel
o
very
nice
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
recently
d
pretty
tasty
and
the
booze
is
well
hidden
o
this
is
a
high
quality
sour
brown
that
cl
has
put
together
its
soft
and
very
complex
wonderful
example
of
the
style
o
the
beer
isnt
that
difficult
to
drink
because
the
sour
flavors
are
not
that
strong
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
skål
o
great
awesome
tart
fruit
sour
and
wild
funk
with
good
malty
balance
gfunk
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
brew
could
have
easily
drank
another
bottle
or
two
myself
glad
i
picked
up
my
total
alotment
at
the
release
as
some
time
in
the
cellar
should
tone
down
the
sour
and
bring
on
the
funk
375ml
bottle
courtesy
of
zestar
pours
a
cloudy
redbrown
color
with
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
is
funky
with
some
basement
and
hints
of
some
fruit
the
aroma
is
definitely
more
like
a
belgian
sour
rather
than
an
american
one
taste
is
tart
but
it
has
some
vinegar
again
more
like
a
belgian
medium
bodied
with
an
oily
texture
dry
finish
this
is
an
awesome
beer
that
seems
to
be
a
perfect
hybrid
of
the
vinegary
funky
belgians
and
the
fullerbodied
american
versions
really
nice
job
overall
i
like
it
i
am
very
glad
i
got
a
bunch
of
these
at
the
release
certainly
worth
the
drive
and
money
o
finally
get
to
put
this
in
ive
had
it
a
few
times
and
have
been
looking
forward
to
really
getting
in
to
one
im
all
about
this
style
and
this
is
a
cool
twist
on
it
the
captain
does
it
right
o
tasting
really
good
right
off
the
bat
i
am
really
psyched
to
see
how
this
batch
ages
o
perfect
level
of
sourness
not
too
heavy
a
fleeting
hint
of
alcohol
but
the
grapes
added
to
this
beer
help
it
finish
perfectly
leaving
a
great
aftertaste
lighter
medium
body
decent
carbonation
dry
and
tingly
across
the
tongue
drinks
really
nice
excellent
flavor
good
level
of
sourness
without
overpowering
the
profile
i
would
drink
this
regularly
if
it
was
available
d
very
nice
stuff
i
would
say
batch
one
was
the
clear
winner
the
batch
two
seemed
to
be
still
developing
a
bit
but
i
am
not
sure
if
it
will
ever
get
to
batch
ones
level
thanks
again
dan
for
the
chance
to
try
these
side
by
side
d
my
first
sour
from
cl
and
im
impressed
good
combination
of
beer
and
wine
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
tasting
so
rosso
is
a
solid
complex
sour
not
the
greatest
ive
ever
tasted
but
definitely
worth
waiting
in
line
for
once
a
year
but
i
cant
for
the
life
of
me
decide
what
a
craft
beer
novice
would
make
of
it
there
are
other
sours
particularly
oud
bruins
that
rookies
tend
to
like
when
i
make
them
try
one
but
rosso
is
odd
its
almost
as
if
its
a
different
sweeter
style
that
somebody
has
painted
over
with
a
very
sour
brush
i
guess
i
mean
its
not
as
welldefined
as
some
other
sours
if
that
makes
sense
dont
get
me
wrong
though
its
a
mighty
fine
brew
thanks
to
alex
for
cracking
this
one
open
after
trying
cuvee
de
castleton
ive
wanted
to
try
more
of
captain
lawrences
sours
nose
has
red
wine
barrels
sweet
malts
and
tart
cherries
big
notes
of
vinegar
kind
of
get
in
the
way
here
same
with
the
taste
good
beer
but
too
much
vinegar
and
acidity
clean
crisp
body
has
a
dry
finish
not
bad
but
too
much
vinegar
well
i
waited
patiently
it
was
a
hard
week
and
i
diserve
this
a
brown
color
that
tends
toward
garnett
red
when
held
to
the
light
initial
pour
appears
with
a
half
finger
of
white
head
that
vanishes
after
minutes
in
the
glass
grapes
red
wine
barrel
fresh
cut
wood
and
just
a
hint
of
vinegar
and
acid
hit
the
olfactory
sour
is
on
my
tongue
before
this
beer
hits
my
lips
grapey
sweetness
bounces
to
tartness
and
transforms
to
woody
basement
oak
and
a
kick
of
brett
funk
followed
by
more
sour
tart
cherry
and
sour
candy
the
palate
is
left
with
scrubing
bubbles
of
sour
cleanliness
feels
like
waves
of
mouth
wash
in
a
good
way
puckering
i
am
so
happy
and
sad
happy
i
am
having
this
great
beer
sad
it
is
leaving
my
cellar
poured
darkish
mahoganyraisin
color
with
a
light
tan
head
slight
sediment
wonderful
aroma
sour
cherry
probably
of
the
ranier
variety
is
most
prominent
touch
of
wood
and
earth
but
balanced
with
much
sweetness
of
lighter
fruits
maybe
even
some
wine
character
in
here
wonderfully
tart
but
not
overly
so
theres
that
distinctive
brettanomyces
coming
out
now
that
it
has
warmed
a
little
bit
to
challenge
the
tartness
hint
of
leather
too
bubbly
carbonation
makes
for
a
nice
fresh
feel
i
would
drink
this
all
day
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
is
decent
i
liked
the
grape
sourness
to
it
it
had
some
nice
complexity
to
it
with
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
it
was
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
during
and
after
dinner
this
evening
this
is
the
best
sour
ive
had
from
captain
lawrence
so
far
and
one
of
the
better
american
wild
ales
ive
had
in
a
while
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
there
are
some
off
flavors
not
sure
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
again
but
i
do
enjoy
it
pours
a
deep
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
head
and
some
lace
the
aroma
is
tart
pie
cherries
with
some
booze
and
some
farmyard
cow
dung
on
haystack
with
a
sort
of
subdued
horse
blanket
note
the
flavor
is
intensely
sour
with
lots
of
cherry
and
lemon
rind
with
a
nice
bitterness
for
balance
along
with
the
earthy
and
oaky
notes
this
is
pretty
gosh
darned
sour
and
fantastic
d
i
remember
having
a
bottle
of
the
first
batch
and
thinking
it
was
pretty
good
however
this
one
didnt
quite
live
up
to
that
experience
d
its
decent
but
im
not
that
impressed
batch
1
was
showing
signs
of
bad
oxidation
cardboard
though
i
still
enjoyed
it
batch
2
has
some
off
flavors
i
am
not
impressed
enough
to
seek
it
out
again
rosso
e
marrone
is
a
rough
us
sour
not
one
of
the
greats
but
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
captain
lawrence
is
hit
or
miss
on
their
sours
for
me
but
for
people
who
like
theirs
acidic
and
bold
this
is
recommended
this
is
my
new
favorite
beer
except
for
the
appearance
theres
so
little
wrong
with
this
beer
set
a
new
standard
for
oud
bruin
for
me
and
beer
in
general
damn
notes
all
the
flavors
are
spot
on
and
all
the
pieces
are
right
but
they
dont
quite
fit
together
properly
i
think
its
too
dry
for
it
to
work
i
had
this
one
at
one
of
the
ba
beerfests
a
few
years
ago
and
remember
it
being
better
was
probably
batch
1
soccerman7
told
me
that
this
batch
was
bottled
with
champagne
yeast
which
would
explain
the
dryness
and
the
crackly
carbonation

aroma
of
weird

is
quite
powerful
with
some
sour

oak
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
also
overpowered
by
the
weird
funk
notes
which
didnt
agree
with
me
i
usually
did
the
barnyard
notes
but
those
were
too
much
and
a
sour
lightly
acidic
finish
body
was
quite
full
with
medium
carbonation
i
had
a
hard
time
getting
into
this

one
of
the
worst
from
a
usually
excellent

overall
this

for

i
just
love
this
and
will
spend
quite
a
bit
of
time
with
this
bottle
excellent
beer
d
if
it
were
possible
i
would
drink
this
on
a
pretty
regular
basis
i
enjoyed
it
definitely
not
in
the
top
group
of
sours
that
were
opened
though
cheers

other
than
the

try
this
mouthfeel

not
overly

puckering
enough
to
be

pretty

d
nice
beer
i
enjoy
flanders
but
i
think
that
this
beer
just
doesnt
deliver
in
the
appearance
department
maybe
with
time
nice
might
seek
out
more
to
age
overall
very
pleased
with
this
one
good
overall
d
great
beer
not
sure
what
the
hype
is
about
very
complex
with
a
pleasantly
enticing
sweet
nose
however
the
look
of
this
brew
is
terrible
and
that
lowers
my
expectations
of
it
from
the
start
mouthfeel
is
lively
as
it
should
be
and
really
serves
to
separate
the
different
flavors
seek
it
out
if
you
can
but
dont
go
overboard
its
not
worth
it
ever
since
i
tried
cdc
and
sfto
rum
ive
been
a
big
captain
lawrence
fan
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
rosso
i
thought
i
just
got
a
poorly
sealed
bottle
the
first
time
but
no
all
the
things
i
didnt
like
about
noreaster
and
sfto
wine
infected
were
summed
up
in
this
beer
it
lacks
whatever
it
is
that
makes
oud
bruins
one
of
my
favorite
styles
was
possibly
expecting
a
little
more
from
this
beer
maybe
it
is
my
fault
for
prehyping
a
beer
but
this
one
let
me
down
a
bit
would
like
to
try
a
batch2
and
see
if
the
carb
level
is
better
and
perhaps
the
beer
doesnt
look
like
gutter
water
overall
a
very
nice
american
example
of
the
style
like
i
said
before
this
reminds
me
of
saint
lamvinus
though
for
me
not
quite
equal
despite
being
a
very
good
beer
would
gladly
have
more
of
this
though
and
you
should
give
it
a
try
if
youre
into
the
style
and
havent
had
it
before
overall
this
beer
soured
a
ton
especially
when
compared
to
the
second
batch
the
complexity
and
fruit
flavors
that
lacked
here
were
much
more
pronounced
in
the
second
batch
as
well
guess
what
im
saying
is
dont
age
this
one
the
fresher
the
better
batch
2
served
at
48
degrees
in
my
allagash
chalice
poured
a
semitranslucent
mahogany
with
a
loose
half
inch
head
that
quickly
dissipated
into
a
consistent
soapy
cap
copious
tiny
bubbles
adhered
to
the
bowl
of
the
glass
after
the
initial
pour
but
quickly
dispersed
only
a
few
strands
of
lacing
present
during
the
tasting
exceptional
nose
with
great
complexity
vinous
and
vinegary
red
wine
with
a
hint
of
cork
and
wood
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
wood
expresses
itself
as
a
buttery
presence
tannins
and
some
citric
acid
also
revealed
tart
but
not
overly
sour
perhaps
a
hint
of
cherries
in
the
mix
as
well
but
very
much
subdued
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
refreshing
carbonation
level
and
a
slight
acidity
that
stimulates
the
palate
and
salivary
glands
culminating
in
a
residual
warmth
in
the
mouth
simply
delicious
ive
been
waiting
for
the
right
mood
to
strike
to
crack
this
one
and
i
am
extremely
happy
with
this
beer
truly
top
notch
a
lot
of
the
differences
between
the
two
batches
are
likely
the
product
of
aging
nothing
seems
to
be
a
recipe
or
barrel
difference
holding
onto
the
rest
of
my
batch
2
bottles
for
a
while
if
they
age
anything
like
batch
1
they
will
be
superb
dthis
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
level
of
complexity
tart
and
sweet
with
a
touch
of
funk
and
a
terrific
feel
d
this
is
a
high
quality
sour
brown
that
cl
has
put
together
its
soft
and
very
complex
wonderful
example
of
the
style
glad
to
have
been
able
to
try
this
gem
really
enjoyable
beer
or
beerwine
hybrid
overall
d
surprisingly
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
as
sours
tend
to
be
hit
or
miss
with
me
rosso
e
marrone
is
sour
to
the
core
but
not
ridiculously
funky
or
farmlike
which
enhances
its
drinkability
overall
this
is
by
far
the
best
flanders
oud
bruin
i
have
had
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
big
bold
flavor
that
is
nicely
complex
the
subtleties
in
this
beer
will
have
your
tongue
and
your
mind
entertained
for
as
long
as
you
have
some
left
in
your
glass
truly
a
pleasure
to
drink
great
work
captain
lawrence
j
even
a
sour
hater
like
myself
can
appreciate
this
fine
beer
very
very
impressive
d
another
excellent
offering
from
captain
lawrence
sad
that
this
is
only
a
375ml
bottle
could
really
go
for
a
little
bit
more
of
this
one
really
good
flavors
and
quite
complex
definitely
would
like
to
sample
again
d
best
sour
i
think
i
have
ever
had
very
original
with
straight
up
tastes
of
everything
advertised
on
the
bottle
no
strange
tastes
or
anything
to
detract
from
this
beer
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
this
dont
miss
out
d
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
finding
new
things
but
nothing
really
tying
everything
together
a
very
good
beer
that
im
glad
i
got
but
not
the
best
that
ive
had
the
slight
carbonation
and
medium
body
lend
this
beer
to
easy
drinking
i
could
easily
enjoy
one
of
these
on
my
own
the
pleasant
balanced
sourness
sits
nicely
on
the
palate
and
brings
enjoyment
with
each
sip
the
smell
is
so
floral
with
some
beautiful
tart
cherry
flavors
and
a
really
interesting
slight
bitter
chocolate
slight
funkiness
unripened
green
grapes
quite
honestly
one
of
the
most
complex
wilds
that
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
sniffin
in
the
taste
the
chocolate
shines
through
sweetly
the
sourness
is
more
in
the
form
of
a
mouthpuckering
balasmic
vinegar
not
quite
acidic
the
vanilla
and
wine
flavors
are
coming
out
great
right
now
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
too
spritzy
and
a
little
bit
too
overcarbonated
im
hoping
that
this
will
curb
with
age
all
in
all
this
has
the
potential
to
age
into
one
of
my
favorite
sours
of
all
time
only
time
will
tell
batch
2
again
as
i
craft
my
description
of
this
beer
im
astounded
by
how
much
it
matches
what
i
have
above
lemony
balsamic
vinegar
musty
grapes
plenty
of
tannins
and
leather
moderate
sourness
leather
yum
overall
an
amazing
sour
that
really
captures
every
element
of
the
style
pours
a
reddish
amber
color
with
a
small
beige
head
that
fizzles
out
quickly
aroma
is
lactic
and
lemony
with
wine
grapes
and
vinegar
berries
nice
subdued
vinous
flavor
very
tart
acetic
and
lactic
qualities
grapes
and
cherries
wood
acetone
very
nice
and
complex
can
definitely
get
lost
in
this
one
low
on
astringency
which
is
a
big
plus
for
a
winey
oaky
beer
the
body
has
some
heft
to
it
which
is
cut
through
nicely
by
the
acidity
very
good
sour
d
wow
i
really
wish
i
had
more
of
this
one
seriously
this
may
be
the
best
sour
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
very
easy
to
sip
on
and
at
no
point
felt
overwhelming
i
was
blown
away
by
the
rich
flavors
and
and
the
dryness
and
wine
like
qualities
well
done
a
waxed
375ml
bottle
batch
1
uncapped
and
poured
into
my
snifter
glass
rosso
appears
a
somewhat
murky
crimson
brown
color
with
barely
a
finger
of
off
white
head
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
pears
grapes
oak
mild
funk
cherries
currants
red
wine
light
sourness
and
vinegar
sweet
dark
sugar
decent
carbonation
levels
with
very
little
alcohol
heat
and
at
the
very
least
a
medium
body
pretty
well
rounded
after
a
year
in
the
bottle
when
i
first
sampled
this
last
year
i
thought
to
myself
that
3
people
could
easily
split
a
bottle
now
id
have
no
problems
enjoying
it
solo
drinkability
going
down
easy
for
me
overall
a
pretty
good
sour
but
nothing
too
special
i
was
a
little
bit
let
down
by
this
one
but
it
was
fairly
drinkable
this
is
very
drinkable
but
im
happy
doing
it
as
sort
of
a
tasting
which
is
where
i
am
drinking
it
tasty
treat
d
i
actually
think
i
prefer
red
poppy
to
this
flanders
i
did
enjoy
this
one
and
wouldnt
mind
trying
it
again
in
the
future
i
think
this
has
several
more
years
of
aging
left
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
i
think
the
funk
will
develop
even
more
over
time
nice
wowza
great
beer
since
this
one
has
dropped
bright
in
the
bottle
its
really
come
into
its
own
its
a
pungent
strong
tasting
brew
but
drinkable
for
all
that
a
nice
take
on
the
flanders
oud
bruin
style
by
captain
lawrence
brewing
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
maltiness
to
add
to
the
complexity
as
i
feel
that
was
the
rossos
one
real
weak
point
i
hope
cl
makes
another
batch
next
year
as
id
like
to
see
if
they
make
any
tweaks
d
the
captain
does
it
again
i
went
into
this
expecting
nothing
short
of
greatness
and
i
certainly
wasnt
disappointed
many
thanks
go
out
to
javier
for
agreeing
to
this
trade
ive
been
trying
to
put
my
hands
on
a
bottle
of
this
ever
since
it
was
released
i
had
one
bottle
break
enroute
to
me
f
u
u
p
s
and
a
couple
trades
fall
throughgo
nowhere
im
really
loving
everything
the
captain
lays
his
hot
little
hands
on
d
if
you
havent
been
able
to
tell
yet
im
in
love
with
this
beer
definitely
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
d
i
took
down
my
12oz
or
so
with
no
problem
and
loved
every
bit
of
it
this
is
a
top
notch
version
of
this
style
while
being
a
wild
ale
the
wildness
is
a
bit
tamed
while
the
taste
is
wonderful
i
think
i
just
found
my
favorite
captain
lawrence
beer
to
date
this
was
special
this
has
good
legs
for
some
aging
alot
going
on
here
i
think
this
one
is
highly
underrated
and
some
of
the
low
reviews
did
not
rate
to
style
personally
i
think
this
is
the
best
beer
for
this
style
much
better
than
red
poppy
d
very
solid
brew
and
definitely
my
favorite
oud
bruin
by
far
easily
drinkable
and
refreshing
hard
to
sip
and
savor
i
do
think
a
touch
more
funk
with
a
drier
feel
and
finish
would
benefit
this
brew
overall
a
very
well
done
example
of
the
style
here
different
a
little
sweeter
then
i
would
normally
expect
but
amazingly
complex
very
happy
to
get
to
try
this
one
d
i
keep
reaching
for
my
glass
theres
no
reason
why
i
couldnt
kill
a
375ml
bottle
of
this
on
my
own
the
aftertaste
is
strong
but
not
overwhelming
and
the
carbonation
and
abv
are
both
pretty
low
id
love
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
of
this
one
maybe
batch
2
d
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
flanders
oud
bruin
style
but
this
is
probably
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
ones
ive
had
taste
mouthfeel
sour
and
tannic
a
bit
like
grapeskin
metallic
midpalate
with
some
odd
earthy
funk
heavyish
body
with
low
carbonation
the
finish
is
somewhat
mineral
and
oxidized
not
entirely
pleasant
had
this
one
sidebyside
with
cuvee
de
castleton
and
thought
that
beer
was
far
superior
really
tasty
beer
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
the
grapes
add
a
nice
complexity
that
is
boosted
by
the
oak
character
and
the
ample
but
not
quite
overwhelming
sourness
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
though
the
aroma
really
needs
to
warm
up
quite
a
bit
before
it
becomes
nicely
complex
from
the
underlying
brettanomyces
influence
d
off
the
charts
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
cuvee
for
me
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
getting
the
hype
that
is
deserves
this
is
a
world
class
american
sour
d
its
glandy
almost
90
of
where
i
want
it
to
be
pours
a
muddy
brown
with
no
head
whatsoever
with
no
head
you
get
no
lacing
sad
looking
brew
to
be
honest
smell
is
pretty
tart
ripe
grapes
funky
brett
and
oak
some
malts
and
earth
in
the
nose
as
well
with
a
touch
of
vinegar
taste
begins
with
a
puckering
vinegar
punch
fresh
rhubarb
and
sour
apples
as
well
midway
the
smooth
malt
and
leather
emerge
with
a
light
bretty
tingle
the
wine
flavors
really
come
forward
in
the
aftertaste
and
i
like
it
a
lot
a
light
to
medium
body
with
an
almost
lifeless
feel
in
the
mouth
although
it
seems
to
fit
pretty
well
im
not
a
huge
sour
freak
yet
but
this
is
just
too
easy
to
drink
another
good
one
from
the
captain
thanks
again
todd
thanks
again
alan
for
the
chance
to
try
this
nectar
of
the
gods
very
nice
beer
and
certainly
deserving
of
all
the
praise
heaped
on
it
top
notch
drinkability
this
is
definitely
the
most
interesting
beer
ive
had
in
quite
awhile
the
oak
is
fairly
strong
in
the
taste
but
mixed
with
those
grapes
it
turns
into
an
amazingly
dry
brew
this
beer
is
very
vinous
and
350ml
isnt
nearly
enough
and
thats
my
only
complaint
thanks
much
for
the
opportunity
mike
this
is
very
drinkable
but
i
cant
help
but
think
it
would
age
beautifully
a
great
sour
but
maybe
the
more
generic
wild
ale
category
would
fit
this
more

a

its

really
affect
the
drinkability
after
some
time
goes
down
easily
mostly
though
can
even
be
refreshing
this
was
by
far
the
oakiest
beer
i
ever
had
this
baby
spent
a
long
time
in
the
barrel
great
brew
that
i
wish
was
more
accesible
for
us
here
in
california
will
be
drinking
more
in
the
future
highly
recommended
medium
bodied
with
a
low

a
unique
and
thoroughly
enjoyable

highly
recommended

d
great
tasting
now
i
think
it
will
only
improve
with

1
bottle
at
a

is
enough
but
it
is
definitely
worth
seeking

i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
although
i
think
with
some
more
time
to
develop
this
is
going
to
be
known
as
a
top
quality
sour
d
an
awesome
brew
that
i
feel
could
compete
with
russian
river
though
needs
some
time
in
the
bottle
to
smooth
out
will
try
another
in
6
months

so

the

just
bland

was
looking
for
in

maybe
this
is
what
happens
to
some
still
very

with

sometime
the
guy
talked
it
up
pretty
well
too
so
i
think
he
disappointed
quite
a
few
with
this
one
like
liquid
fruitcake
nice
balance
of
honeydrizzled
malts
bread
doughy
yeast
and
fleshy
mango
strawberry
puree
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
fantastically
creamy
so
smooth
abv
is
well
hidden
spot
on
with
many
of
the
brunestyle
beers
i
have
had
fruity
dubbel
is
not
too
far
off
either
tasty
stuff
does
pelican
brew
any
bad
beer
drinkability
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
for
my
tastebuds
it
has
a
nice
sweet
character
that
really
works
for
a
dubbel
but
lacks
a
yeasty
complexity
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
slick
with
a
nice
bite
of
carbonation
a
bit
oily
but
still
very
nice
d
whew
very
nice
dubbel
ive
tried
other
belgianstyled
ales
crafted
by
pelican
and
have
been
impressed
this
however
is
probably
my
favorite
yet
rare
to
the
point
ive
never
seen
this
beer
before
on
tap
and
have
only
heard
of
bottles
offered
at
the
brewery
in
pacific
city
if
you
like
belgians
and
have
a
chance
to
try
it
le
pelican
brun
is
a
must
drinkability
is
high
really
loving
this
right
now
those
who
prefer
a
more
peppery
grainy
style
dubbel
wont
care
for
this
e
g
polar
opposite
of
the
bornem
dubbel
but
if
you
like
em
on
the
sweet
side
seek
this
out
i
for
one
know
i
need
to
get
my
ass
back
to
pacific
city
pronto
and
grab
a
few
more
of
these
pint
at
the
brewpub
outside
in
the
late
summer
sun
beautiful
dark
brown
slighty
hazedsmall
tan
head
that
stays
aroma
is
definatlly
yeasty
but
with
hints
of
burnt
brown
sugar
and
coriander
spicycomplex
yeasty
malt
driven
flavoursalso
a
noticable
sourness
which
is
very
pleasing
its
almost
to
the
point
of
a
belgian
sour
but
not
quite
very
intrgueing
very
nice
palate
thick
and
silky
smooth
nicelingering
flavours
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
nice
surprise
the
abbey
dubbel
style
is
not
commonly
duplicated
by
northwest
brewers
but
its
not
surprising
that
pelican
would
deliver
a
worthy
effort
a
paucity
of
suds
was
the
bruns
only
notable
shortcoming
overall
complex
and
flavorful
all
the
flavors
are
distinct
and
still
work
well
together
d
a
solid
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
not
too
acidic
nor
too
boozy
with
sufficient
complexity
and
depth
and
good
balance
between
the
various
flavors
id
happily
drink
this
again
and
hope
brad
keeps
making
it
nice
to
have
tried
it
but
wont
be
searching
it
out
again
o
i
love
this
beer
sour
cherry
tartness
and
sweet
toffee
mix
extremely
well
together
its
quite
balanced
and
flavorful
i
often
find
the
acidity
overtakes
this
style
but
the
sourness
is
mild
and
balanced
by
fruitiness
and
caramel
sweetness
in
this
beer
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
of
this
style
overall
another
very
good
bottle
from
jackie
os
good
complexity
with
a
good
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
o
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
sour
family
of
beer
i
have
ever
had
this
is
one
you
just
have
to
try
to
really
get
the
gist
of
all
the
things
that
are
going
on
with
this
beer
i
dont

whew

wonderful
the

the

here
the
beer
is

pretty

with
a
broke

of

cherry

the

with

acetic
and
sharp
yet
not

per

certainly
puckering
complex
and
intriguing
a
unique
beer
for
sure
id
happily
try
this
again
a
very
interesting
and
intriguing
beer
from
de
struise
not
sure
how
much
or
how
often
i
could
drink
this
but
i
was
very
glad
to
be
able
to
finally
try
this
well
regarded
beer
at
long
last
rating
is
for
the
2007
vintage
o
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
more
carbonation
in
this
but
does
resemble
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
seems
over
the
hill
based
on
the
oxidation
and
flatness
initially
thought
it
might
be
infected
but
it
isnt
id
suggest
these
be
consumed
rather
than
cellared
any
longer
oas
a
fan
of
de
struise
and
of
sours
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
and
it
did
not
let
me
down
the
flavors
are
typically
belgian
in
their
subtlety
but
part
of
that
subtlety
might
have
been
the
age
of
this
bottle
regardless
this
beer
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
it
proves
that
huge
fruit
or
acidity
arent
always
necessary
to
make
a
good
sour
beer
o
overall
this
is
tasty
held
up
well
to
age
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
vintage
overall
a
nice
tasting
oud
bruin
but
some
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
maybe
a
bit
past
its
prime
overall
pretty
nice
a
nicely
aged
oud
bruin
great
flavors
although
the
lack
of
carbonation
and
slight
oxidation
take
away
a
bit
still
a
decent
beer
but
not
among
the
greats
overall
reminds
me
of
a
bfm
beer
incredibly
complex
with
blatant
flaws
not
something
i
could
drink
regularly
but
this
was
a
nice
treat
this
afternoon
wow
what
a
beer
the
complexity
and
range
of
flavours
are
incredible
even
though
i
find
it
quite
a
challenging
brew
the
sour
vinegar
character
is
nicely
balanced
by
sweetness
and
fruity
notes
the
glaring
flaw
is
the
lack
of
carbonation
which
detracts
from
the
mouthfeel
but
also
affects
the
flavour
im
sure
that
the
experience
on
the
palate
would
be
different
with
greater
co2
presence
nonetheless
this
is
an
impressive
effort
from
de
struise
and
one
that
im
happy
to
have
tried
probably
not
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
well
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
opportunity
overall
while
lacking
the
mouthfeel
and
head
retention
that
would
bump
this
one
up
a
few
notches
really
very
satisfying
d
plenty
of
punch
and
interest
here
although
i
think
i
would
prefer
it
with
some
years
on
it
to
smooth
the
currently
aggressive
edges
a
vinegar
and
wine
grape
bomb
awesome
nonlambic
sour
imo
i
really
dont
know
anything
about
the
background
of
this
beer
but
i
certainly
enjoyed
whatever
it
is
overall
like
i
said
above
im
not
sure
if
i
love
this
or
hate
it
its
probably
somewhere
in
between
its
flavorful
interesting
and
complex
enough
to
make
it
enjoayable
but
im
not
sure
if
this
is
really
my
style
in
any
case
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
figured
out
as
this
is
a
little
too
flat
even
for
this
style
either
way
this
is
a
quality
beer
by
a
quality
brewer
so
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
this
will
probably
be
your
thing
2

d
this
is
wholely
unrefined
im
okay
with
the
sourness
and
the
balsalmic
flavors
hell
sometimes
ill
pour
a
quarter
ounce
of
balsalmic
vinegar
into
a
snifter
just
to
sip
on
but
the
acetone
is
really
offputting
i
guess
a
few
too
many
bug
species
got
in
there
this
would
be
a
lot
better
if
a
few
things
were
different
but
such
it
is
as
it
is
super
complex
and
powerful
but
just
not
that
good
the
lack
of
carbonation
holds
this
back
from
being
significantly
better
overall
smells
fantastic
but
the
rest
doesnt
measure
up
approach
with
caution
o
overall
this
is
a
super
in
your
face
flanders
kind
of
weird
but
definitely
different
puckeringly
sour
and
drinkable
in
a
weird
way
in
the
way
you
have
to
look
at
a
car
accident
when
passing
something
weird
about
it
that
keeps
bringing
you
back
not
that
the
beer
is
an
accident
just
interesting
i
wonder
what
time
has
done
to
this
fresh
i
find
2008
to
be
a
sweet
spot
on
barrel
aged
brews
and
big
stouts
right
now
but
flanders
o
a
very
good
flanders
oud
bruin
deep
intriguing
would
be
curious
to
see
how
it
ages
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
even
though
it
smells
very
unique
with
a
bit
of
age
i
think
it
will
balance
out
nicely
and
drink
amazingly
well
time
to
toss
it
deep
in
the
cellar
and
forget
about
it
a
good
but
not
great
flemish
red
overall
pretty
good
but
not
a
standout
for
me
happy
to
have
had
it
poured
burgundy
with
some
light
brown
brown
highlights
bubbles
serve
as
head
and
once
they
disappear
nothing
remains
no
head
or
retention
legs
are
pretty
decent
though
nose
has
some
black
cherry
balsamic
vinegar
currant
light
vinous
notes
and
a
sense
of
sourness
there
is
a
substantial
sweet
component
to
this
as
well
taste
has
dark
cherries
and
berries
light
acetic
tartness
produced
by
similar
balsamic
notes
and
a
gentle
earthy
maltiness
light
pucker
in
the
finish
but
again
the
sweet
and
sticky
components
of
this
beer
make
themselves
well
known
no
alcohol
on
the
palate
and
low
carbonation
somewhere
between
still
and
gentle
prickliness
a
nice
semitart
yet
sweet
flemish
red
glad
to
have
seen
and
had
this
quick
edit
this
beer
is
8
abv
now
bumping
the
mouthfeel
up
to
a
4
from
3
5
no
heat
whatsoever
on
this
bad
boy
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
its
not
super
sour
but
a
very
nice
mix
of
sour
fruitvinegar
with
sweet
fruits
interested
to
see
what
my
fresh
bottle
tastes
like
o
this
is
not
my
beer
but
i
am
glad
that
i
have
tried
it
once
it
is
to
sour
and
fruity
to
my
liking
dont
get
my
wrong
i
still
find
it
pretty
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
pretty
decent
id
like
a
touch
more
carbonation
but
the
beer
smells
awesome
and
tastes
great
definitely
more
important
than
a
few
extra
bubbles
one
of
the
better
flanders
oud
bruin
ive
had
which
admittedly
isnt
a
ton
thanks
much
jeff
o
this
is
certainly
a
new
take
on
a
flanders
red
however
the
flavors
never
quite
balance
each
other
out
cheers
thin
flat
and
tepid
on
the
tongue
lingering
acidic
vinegar
ruined
my
palate
for
at
least
an
hour
after
this
apparently
theres
some
variation
between
vintages
but
this
one
was
awful
avoid
additional
note
many
of
my
friends
have
mentioned
that
this
vintage
tates
like
cool
whip
im
almost
mad
that
theres
nothing
reminding
me
of
fake
whipped
cream
o
as
soon
as
i
smelt
this
beer
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
is
mat
vinegar
and
fish
and
chips
but
then
again
i
admittedly
prefer
tartar
sauce
on
my
fish
and
ketchup
on
my
chips
and
i
cant
think
of
a
time
when
id
ever
drink
a
glass
of
malt
vinegar
while
some
people
might
find
this
beer
drinkable
i
didnt
a
few
ounces
was
all
i
could
handle
ive
heard
so
many
interesting
things
about
this
beer
that
i
had
no
problem
when
it
was
chosen
to
be
cracked
first
tonight
it
pours
a
murky
rubybrown
with
no
real
head
of
any
kind
to
speak
of
the
nose
comprises
tomato
light
tart
black
cherry
light
raspberry
vinaigrette
caramel
and
teriyaki
sauce
im
actually
a
little
surprised
that
i
like
what
im
smelling
given
what
i
just
wrote
the
taste
holds
notes
of
soy
sauce
including
a
pinch
of
salt
light
cocoa
cherry
tomatoes
red
grapes
and
red
apple
skin
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slick
fluid
feel
overall
an
interesting
beer
indeed
one
im
not
entirely
sure
if
i
liked
or
disliked
d
this
didnt
seem
to
age
well
perhaps
i
should
have
gotten
to
it
a
bit
sooner
ill
have
to
revisit
the
new
batch
although
i
didnt
care
for
it
either
if
i
recall
correctly
the
most
enjoyable
time
i
had
this
beer
was
when
i
had
it
straight
for
the
barrels

the

a

loose

froth
around
the
shoulders
which
continues
to
dissipate
into

and
a
thin

bubbly
band
i
love
the
nose
on
this
beer
vinous
oaky
vanilla
notes
dark

plum
figs
prunes
and
a
suggestion
of
grape
bubblegum
taste
is
a
bit
more
muddled
vinous
quality
still
presents
itself
as
well
as
some
citric
acid
however
theres
also
a
bit
of
chocolate
as
well
as
more
grape
notes
a
slight
earthiness
and
prunes
tannins
are
present
but
the
acidity
pretty
much
buries
the
vanilla
and
oak
expressed
in
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
consistency
with
a
mild
carbonation
which
is
almost
still
acidity
lightly
stimulates
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
and
lingers
along
the
glands
at
the
back
of
the
throat
between
quaffs
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
complexity
of
this
beer
and
plan
on
cellaring
a
couple
bottles
to
see
how
it
changes
over
time
a
slightly
tart
and
vinegary
fob
without
being
overly
sour
i
wish
there
were
more
efforts
at
this
style
readily
available
and
always
with
this
mixture
of
styles
between
brussels
champagne
and
flemish
burgundy
that
makes
the
complex
beer
tasty
and
also
easy
to
drink
overall
so
sour
and
vinegary
very
interesting
and
im
so
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
dont
know
that
i
would
have
another
i
would
however
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
and
i
will
be
trying
to
get
more
the
carbonation
is
low
here
bordering
on
flat
and
the
body
is
some
what
light
overall
simply
terrible
de
struise
should
be
ashamed
truly
terrible
drink
this
was
a
very
good
beer
again
this
is
polarizing
and
it
was
quite
different
from
the
oude
tart
or
marron
acidife
i
have
had
for
this
style
overall
this
was
different
smooth
and
enjoyable
o
this
one
was
a
huge
let
down
for
me
i
was
expecting
something
more
from
this
brewer
glad
i
never
plunked
down
the
coin
to
have
some
shipped
to
me
o
quite
an
interesting
beer
but
some
carbonation
would
help
and
just
a
touch
more
sour
would
really
bring
this
one
into
line
it
is
fairly
enjoyable
but
just
seems
a
bit
lacking
will
revisit
again
thanks
to
the
boys
of
oostvleteren
d
creative
and
wild
to
say
the
least
i
give
this
an
a
for
style
and
presentation
although
it
would
be
tough
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
age
has
really
done
wonders
for
this
beer
really
smooth
with
flavors
that
are
well
balanced
but
still
distinct
and
prominent
at
the
same
time
a
solid
representation
of
the
style

sour
note
on
the
finish
a
real
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
here
however
there
is
some
interesting
hotness
on
the
back
end
great
palate
feel
not
thin
well
balanced
and
slightly
prickly
true
to
form
this
beer
is
a
real
gem
thanks
to
phishisphunk
for
the
opportunity
not
a
huge
fan
of
flanders
style
but
pretty
enjoyable
the
low
carb
really
nonexistant
makes
this
very
wine
like
so
someone
who
enjoys
both
wine
and
beer
would
be
a
fan
sourness
is
definitely
mellow
while
the
woodiness
of
it
really
elevated
maybe
a
little
too
sweet
but
not
like
a
sucking
on
a
penny
like
some
beers
of
this
style
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
reddishmahogany
highlights
a
few
light
tan
bubbles
to
start
and
then
it
falls
completely
flat
which
is
then
echoed
in
the
flavor
and
feel
the
nose
brings
a
bit
of
light
soy
sauce
and
mild
sweetness
which
oddly
enough
reminds
me
a
bit
of
2009
dark
lord
slight
cherry
cherry
along
with
lactic
acid
and
a
bit
of
vinegar
the
flavor
goes
straight
from
the
nose
bringing
through
cherry
soy
sauce
vinegar
and
some
very
mild
sweetness
light
body
with
very
low
carbonation
and
a
pretty
heavy
acetic
acid
presence
definitely
not
for
everyone
but
i
quite
enjoyed
this
overall
i
thought
the
cherry
flavors
were
a
bit
too
heavy
for
this
to
be
anything
more
than
a
good
beer
still
interesting
and
worth
a
shot
wow
overall
what
a
fantastic
taste
pity
the
carbonation
is
too
low
o
this
was
horrible
and
hard
to
drink
bad
bottles
bad
batch
whatever
it
is
im
going
to
use
a
taster
to
screen
all
bottles
of
this
for
me
from
now
on
as
i
have
no
desire
to
be
subjected
to
this
again
not
perfect
but
the
complex
flavor
makes
this
a
keeper
for
me
its
surprisingly
drinkable
too
o
i
really
dont
like
struise
and
this
is
another
great
example
why
unremarkable
boring
bleh
overall
this
is
not
the
beer
for
me
i
would
have
loved
a
mouth
puckering
taste
that
was
reminiscent
in
the
aroma
but
all
i
got
was
metal
it
reminded
me
of
when
i
was
a
kid
and
had
a
mouth
full
of
pennies
only
this
time
i
didnt
get
any
money
after
the
experience
big
thanks
to
auroracrisis
for
this
one
dark
brown
color
almost
looks
burgundy
smell
is
complex
oud
bruin
a
little
sourness
spices
the
flavor
is
very
good
but
not
your
typical
oud
bruin
this
seems
more
spicy
and
nuanced
and
has
a
sourness
on
the
finish
that
really
pulls
at
your
cheeks
like
a
lemon
does
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
a
little
bit
pricey
and
not
easy
to
get
a
hold
of
o
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
i
like
this
beer
it
is
unique
and
has
a
depth
and
complexity
most
beers
lack
should
be
interesting
to
age
earthmonk
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
oud
bruin
i
normally
find
the
style
to
be
a
bit
sweet
and
offputting
but
this
feels
like
a
balanced
oud
bruin
with
some
of
the
great
tartness
of
a
mild
flanders
red
d
this
is
a
great
flanders
maybe
even
a
bit
unique
than
most
very
mild
in
carbonation
but
the
sour
profile
and
oak
really
carries
this
beer
through
to
the
end
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
this
ages
overall
an
interesting
beer
ultimately
though
i
come
up
disappointed
for
a
beer
in
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
is
a
bit
too
vinegary
and
not
enough
funk
or
cherry
flavor
that
said
this
beer
is
still
enjoyable
edit
just
opened
another
bottle
of
this
and
it
is
vastly
improved
compared
to
my
last
review
carbonation
is
better
and
a
bit
more
tartness
seems
to
have
developed
very
interesting
yeast
character
as
well
glad
to
have
a
few
bottles
left
big
thanks
goes
out
to
funkydelic
for
sharing
this
one
during
one
of
our
weekly
tastings
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
flute
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
a
very
minimal
light
tan
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
pure
acetic
acid
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
balsamic
vinegar
fruit
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
very
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
for
some
odd
reason
i
know
i
shouldnt
but
i
really
liked
this
one
im
a
chemist
for
a
living
and
work
with
pure
acetic
acid
sometimes
and
i
just
love
the
smell
of
it
this
brew
reminds
me
of
said
smell
during
the
tasting
i
even
joked
about
pouring
this
over
a
salad
to
make
the
best
salad
ever
but
anyways
if
you
do
not
like
vinegar
flavors
in
your
brew
avoid
this
one
at
all
costs
if
you
do
get
this
on
your
palate
asap
this
is
what
i
would
define
as
a
love
or
hate
beer
i
loved
it
woah
this
stuff
is
weird
im
not
sure
that
this
one
is
for
me
but
i
would
wager
that
this
is
closer
to
a
real
oud
bruin
than
some
of
the
miscategorized
brown
american
wilds
the
beer
is
heavy
on
the
palate
with
its
full
body
and
low
carbonation
it
also
has
some
very
unusual
flavors
and
aromas
earthmonk
is
unlike
any
oud
bruin
ive
ever
had
before
a
very
unique
flavor
that
was
unfortunately
hurt
by
the
lack
of
bubbles
skål
o
im
not
all
that
happy
about
this
one
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
but
i
really
had
to
struggle
to
get
through
the
small
expensive
bottle
the
flavors
just
arent
good
enough
to
overcome
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
nose
is
utterly
complex
with
interplay
of
sour
sweet
fruity
and
sherry
aromas
the
sourness
takes
after
balsamic
vinegar
which
is
quite
intense
denoting
an
aged
example
as
do
the
obvious
sherrynotes
the
malt
is
quite
rich
with
caramel
and
slight
chocolaty
character
while
fruity
esters
are
reminiscent
of
raisins
plum
and
black
cherries
some
brown
sugar
is
noticeable
as
is
the
mild
alcohol
in
the
background
the
malts
balsamic
vinegar
and
black
cherry
produce
rich
tartsweet
flavor
with
intensity
of
a
soy
sauce
a
very
faint
mushroomlike
bitterness
indicates
that
brettanomyces
has
been
used
to
add
sourness
to
this
one
the
beer
is
said
to
be
oakaged
and
thats
welcomed
as
it
gives
balsamic
character
to
the
vinegar
but
unexpected
because
maturation
on
oak
is
typical
to
flanders
red
not
bruin
body
is
mediumfull
and
smooth
due
to
nearly
absent
carbonation
and
besides
the
poor
appearance
flat
mouthfeel
is
the
major
flaw
of
otherwise
excellent
beer
this
is
a
medium
to
full
bodied
brew
with
a
very
light
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
very
well
integrated
in
this
brew
this
is
a
very
complex
offering
that
i
have
a
hard
time
fully
wrapping
myself
around
but
it
is
uniquely
enjoyable
and
it
really
warmed
up
to
me
and
i
started
to
dig
it
more
as
the
glass
emptied
it
is
balanced
very
well
with
a
mix
of
flavors
that
seemingly
evolve
into
something
different
with
every
sip
the
biggest
disappointment
here
is
the
complete
lack
of
carbonation
that
would
really
drive
this
one
home
as
a
standout
winning
brew
while
this
isnt
the
best
offering
i
have
had
from
struise
it
most
certainly
is
among
the
most
complex
and
interesting
i
intend
to
get
some
more
of
this
and
see
what
some
age
does
body
is
medium
with
a
very
slight
carbonation
being
that
flanders
oud
bruins
are
typically
similar
to
this
i
have
to
think
that
this
is
done
right
and
give
more
points
to
de
struisse
i
have
no
idea
where
the
8
is
hidden
but
this
comes
together
like
a
masterpiece
and
i
can
really
enjoy
sipping
on
it
overall
i
heard
this
beer
was
one
of
a
kind
and
it
certainly
lived
up
to
that
billing
it
is
not
for
everybody
as
is
indicative
from
the
reviews
all
over
the
place
but
it
is
well
worth
seeking
out
as
you
wont
know
if
you
like
it
until
you
try
it
its
drinking
good
now
fresh
but
the
inherent
complexity
makes
me
glad
i
have
a
few
to
lay
down
to
see
how
this
tasty
beer
evolves
over
time
o
meh
will
prob
pass
along
my
other
bottles
too
much
going
on
and
it
doesnt
really
come
together
overall
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
lots
of
rustic
true
to
form
flavors
in
there
that
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
never
experienced
in
an
oud
bruin
but
it
seems
to
be
missing
a
little
bit
of
approachability
due
to
the
earthyness
and
complex
character
of
the
beverage
a
must
try
for
any
fan
of
the
style
but
be
forewarned
that
this
beast
is
not
tame
o
best
flemish
red
ive
ever
tried
period
duchesse
on
crack
i
love
this
beer
its
a
shame
i
only
bought
6
will
have
to
buy
some
more
when
more
is
released
ive
tried
several
struise
beers
now
and
i
believe
this
is
my
new
favorite
looking
forward
to
letting
some
of
my
bottles
age
for
awhile
to
see
how
this
evolves
this
beer
has
an
earthy
taste
light
sour
and
also
sweetness
cherrie
well
hidden
but
also
very
in
front
some
times
let
the
beer
swirl
into
the
glass
and
you
will
have
a
great
time
overall
i
really
dig
this
its
a
sour
but
not
overwhelming
im
a
huge
fan
of
de
struise
and
this
one
stands
out
as
a
favorite
of
mine
i
first
had
this
several
years
ago
and
have
been
waiting
patiently
for
its
next
release
o
im
between
and
betwixt
on
this
one
nothing
really
stands
out
on
it
im
lead
to
believe
that
a
this
beer
is
past
its
prime
secondary
to
the
oxidized
flavors
and
aromas
or
b
im
consuming
a
bad
batch
the
8
abv
is
evidently
noticeable
on
the
finish
and
lends
a
warming
feeling
long
after
i
would
really
like
to
try
a
fresh
batch
as
im
lead
to
an
inclination
that
at
some
point
in
the
lifespan
of
this
beer
is
a
world
class
flanders
oud
bruin
will
certainly
seek
out
again
overall
when
i
had
the
beer
it
was
still
very
young
so
nice
and
soft
with
all
flavors
coming
out
very
balanced
probably
overtime
the
sourness
will
get
a
bit
more
pronounced
but
for
me
this
beer
is
close
to
perfect
now
overall
this
brew
boggled
my
mind
as
i
had
never
tasted
an
oude
bruin
quite
like
this
one
throughout
the
sampling
i
kept
wanting
more
and
more
of
this
unique
brew
needless
to
say
i
will
be
looking
to
acquire
more
bottles
in
the
end
another
winner
from
struise
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
simply
wonderful
i
am
wondering
due
to
the
mixed
reviews
if
there
were
some
bad
bottles
or
if
a
certain
year
was
better
than
another
2008
was
exceptional
on
tap
d
drinkability
is
not
bad
lack
of
carbonation
does
hurt
this
brew
but
it
is
still
drinkable
nonetheless
its
big
its
bold
frankly
there
is
just
quite
a
bit
to
take
in
as
it
warms
and
after
a
few
sips
it
really
mellows
out
not
sure
i
could
take
more
than
one
though
maybe
on
another
day
but
definitely
not
in
the
same
session
i
heard
good
things
and
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
but
unfortunately
it
fell
short
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
an
espresso
swirl
head
the
aroma
is
some
vinegar
and
farmyardish
namely
horse
blanket
aroma
with
just
a
mild
roastiness
in
there
as
well
the
flavor
is
sour
and
mildly
sweet
with
lots
of
sour
cherry
and
plenty
of
lactic
acidity
all
this
pairs
oddly
well
with
a
malty
and
chocolaty
flavor
that
lurks
in
the
background
pretty
damn
nice
the
aging
is
mellowing
it
out
and
rounding
it
so
that
it
has
much
the
same
character
as
a
nothoppy
aged
barleywine
or
perhaps
a
thomas
hardy
with
the
added
dimension
of
a
sour
backbone
and
perhaps
a
little
less
body
very
very
good
but
not
world
class
in
my
opinion
and
relative
to
other
flemmish
sours
not
really
to
style
awesome
beer
another
great
de
struise
worth
trying
medium
bodied
and
slightly
puckering
with
a
great
balance
of
sweet
dark
fruit
notes
earthy
oak
and
tart
funk
vinous
with
hints
of
grape
dark
cherry
and
plum
as
well
as
hints
of
oak
and
vanilla
not
too
sourpuckering
but
slightly
funky
with
a
sweet
yet
dry
finish
not
as
extreme
or
complex
as
other
belgians
of
the
style
but
very
flavorful
nicely
balanced
and
extremely
quaffable
ive
learned
since
that
a
run
of
these
bottles
were
apparently
pretty
bad
thats
the
batch
i
got
not
sure
where
this
went
wrong
but
it
was
way
off
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
nice
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
like
the
dark
fruit
aspect
of
the
beer
and
the
sourness
is
well
balanced
that
being
said
this
beer
doesnt
quite
have
enough
going
on
for
me
to
seek
it
out
again
but
if
i
could
buy
it
off
the
shelf
i
would
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
like
how
tart
it
is
but
yet
it
still
provides
oak
and
malt
flavors
pretty
drinkable
the
cherries
were
excellent
id
easily
have
more
of
this
one
bottle
opens
with
the
tiniest
mouse
fart
of
a
pfftt
then
pours
a
really
dark
brown
color
with
very
minimal
head
which
i
expected
after
the
description
the
aroma
is
actually
very
nondescript
with
notes
of
fruit
sourness
oak
and
some
mild
acetone
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
nose
with
a
very
robust
flavor
profile
some
mineral
type
earth
notes
in
the
taste
as
well
some
acetone
present
as
is
some
sourtart
cherries
not
as
fruitful
or
sweet
as
other
sourswilds
that
i
have
had
i
think
i
get
a
touch
of
leather
as
well
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
for
its
authenticity
and
complexity
far
from
being
the
best
in
this
class
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
i
wish
the
nose
had
a
more
pronounced
smell
and
there
was
a
little
carbonation
drinkability
is
amazing
because
somehow
this
sour
beer
is
smooth
you
arent
left
mouth
puckering
pours
black
opaque
with
frothy
light
brown
foam
that
persists
a
while
the
smell
is
nicely
sour
and
tart
with
notes
of
cherries
plums
wood
and
acetic
acid
lightly
sweet
up
front
though
not
overly
so
but
fades
to
a
tart
finish
flavors
of
cherry
and
wood
with
a
kiss
of
spice
lightly
tart
flavors
linger
briefly
smooth
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
almost
creamy
up
front
with
a
tart
finish
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
a
solid
flanders
which
straddles
the
line
between
wine
and
beer
lots
of
oak
tart
fruit
and
underlying
sugar
coming
together
in
a
nice
little
package
for
some
reason
it
escaped
my
notice
until
this
moment
but
de
struise
brouwers
brews
damn
good
beer
black
albert
struise
tsjeeses
and
pannepot
old
fishermans
ale
in
all
its
various
guises
are
great
examples
of
their
respective
styles
looks
like
we
can
add
earthmonk
to
the
list
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
fairly
complex
oud
bruin
but
the
20
price
tag
is
just
silly
d
phenomenal
except
for
the
price
tag
and
availability
still
this
is
probably
worth
the
23
per
ounce
from
the
bottle
2008
tasting
of
many

co
minimal

slightly

flavor

crazy
unique
and
tasty
and
weird
and
fun
ayieee
d
needless
to
say
i
was
very
disappointed
by
this
beer
i
was
hoping
that
it
would
be
as
enjoyable
as
most
of
the
other
struise
beers
are
but
this
one
is
just
not
good
tough
to
finish
even
half
a
bottle
completely
flat
for
a
beer
with
this
low
of
an
abv
and
a
lighter
more
moderate
mouthfeel
unforgivable
a
very
nice
flanders
oud
bruin
probably
the
best
one
ive
tried
to
date
beer
is
biting
sour
strong
almost
wine
like
flavors
with
the
fruits
finishes
dry
which
was
a
surprise
there
are
late
acetic
vinegar
acidicity
that
adds
to
the
palate
connectivity
even
though
there
was
no
visible
carbonation
in
the
glass
on
the
palate
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
that
helps
to
activate
the
sourness
of
the
late
flavors
the
sweetness
is
still
there
as
well
beer
is
well
balanced
between
these
two
flavors
drinkability
is
not
as
high
as
i
would
have
hoped
but
it
was
also
getting
quite
late
i
would
drink
it
again
and
seek
it
out
again
a
great
great
beer
drinkability
is
great
not
overly
acidic
or
vinegary
with
an
interesting
balanced
sour
edge
to
it
this
is
a
damn
tasty
flanders
brown
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
quite
slick
low
carbonation
this
is
pretty
solid
but
the
crazy
sour
fruit
character
in
the
taste
is
a
little
too
much
still
i
dig
this
thanks
dan
t
flavor
starts
with
port
wine
and
progresses
to
a
rick
sourness
and
very
high
acidity
a
unique
brew
something
to
be
sought
after
taste
was
not
as
intense
as
the
aroma
tart
cherries
maybe
some
plum
in
there
as
well
little
oakiness
blends
nicely
again
little
funky
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
the
taste
is
equally
odd
but
only
semienjoyable
slight
roasts
matched
with
an
overly
sourly
vinegar
flavor
which
is
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
lacks
any
form
of
life
which
adds
to
my
disappointment
all
in
all
it
is
drinkable
but
it
wouldnt
draw
my
attention
if
faced
with
options
di
cant
do
8
sour
beers
all
night
but
if
i
could
i
would
be
doing
this
one
md
rather
flat
but
still
very
full
bodied
finishes
very
dry
leaving
the
mouth
almost
chalky
surprisingly
sippable
given
the
tartness
and
drynes
this
was
one
strange
brew
in
every
aspect
it
definitely
seemed
more
like
a
wine
a
cheap
young
merlot
mixed
with
a
bit
of
sherry
to
be
exact
than
a
beer
this
may
not
have
been
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
would
love
to
give
it
to
my
wine
loving
friends
who
have
yet
to
try
a
beer
they
like
d
average
to
a
little
better
its
a
sipper
sort
of
like
a
mediumbodied
red
wine
d
not
really
digging
this
one
this
was
split
with
beachbun1975
and
it
was
a
bit
hard
to
finish
my
sample
the
mouthfeel
is
medum
bodied
with
a
great
mouthfeel
a
most
intriguing
experience
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
one
perhaps
my
expectations
were
too
high
11
2oz

dark
opaque

quite
a

quite

with
plenty
of

and

character
slight

sour

a

taste
is

acidic
with

sour
though
not
strongly
so
ferric
cherry
flavors
come
through
before
a
dry
finish
mediumfull
body
with
medium
carbonation
had
higher
expectations
for
this
one
though
this
bottle
was
slightly
oxidized
i
was
perplexed
when
i
poured
this
super
dark
brown
beer
into
a
tulip
because
it
produced
no
head
and
no
lacing
huh
weird
my
nose
was
met
with
brett
up
front
with
some
background
aromas
of
stale
coffee
sweet
dark
fruit
and
horse
blanket
there
was
a
pleasant
amount
of
pucker
with
a
dark
roasty
background
thick
and
a
tad
chewy
with
a
clean
finish
tart
doesnt
linger
i
would
like
to
have
this
again
but
the
price
tag
is
a
little
shocking
at
close
to
20
for
a
small
bottle
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
basic
snifter
glass
the
ale
appears
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
red
hues
and
barely
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
aromas
and
flavors
are
of
fruity
vinegar
tart
apples
sour
cherries
figs
raisins
oak
tannins
akin
to
those
present
in
red
wines
medium
funk
nice
balance
of
sweet
sour
and
funk
right
around
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
which
works
well
here
very
decent
drinkability
the
sweetsour
flavors
leave
me
craving
more
after
each
sip
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
no
head
whatsoever
smells
of
heavy
red
wine
or
red
wine
vinegar
to
be
more
precise
tastes
like
a
mixture
of
a
full
bodied
red
wine
with
some
vinegar
and
some
more
overripe
dark
fruit
leaves
a
slightly
bitter
sour
aftertaste
very
warming
in
the
mouth
it
has
a
fullrich
body
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
definitely
not
my
fave
from
this
great
brewery
but
a
good
beer
and
something
great
to
try
nonetheless
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
no
head
or
lacing
the
smell
is
very
nice
of
sour
cherries
and
oranges
the
flavor
has
a
nice
balance
between
the
sour
and
the
malt
flavors
big
in
both
not
too
big
with
the
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
but
the
carb
level
is
way
low
very
drinkable
brew
for
8
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
and
easier
to
get
my
hands
on
an
excellent
sour
beer
that
very
enjoyable
worth
the
effort
to
get
to
try
excellent
overall
experience
get
this
is
you
can
its
worth
it
drinkability
one
of
the
deepest
and
most
complex
beers
i
have
had
the
fortune
of
trying
a
slight
bit
too
much
vinegar
flavor
for
me
but
otherwise
an
outstanding
beer
i
have
one
more
bottle
that
i
have
been
aging
for
6
months
now
and
will
continue
to
age
for
at
least
another
year
d
glad
i
got
to
try
this
ill
give
my
other
bottle
another
year
and
see
what
comes
of
it
pours
a
murky
brownish
red
with
no
head
complex
nose
acetic
and
oaky
with
dark
macerated
cherries
sherry
vinegar
and
brown
sugar
the
cherries
smell
deep
and
dark
with
wonderful
nuances
the
taste
is
also
complex
with
more
of
that
wonderful
cherry
flavor
winey
and
sour
but
with
a
rich
but
light
cherry
liquor
sweetness
lurking
in
the
background
and
some
very
complex
funky
earthiness
with
a
bit
of
horseblanket
but
not
so
far
as
barnyard
wondefully
sweettart
but
with
great
depth
very
smooth
and
even
a
bit
creamy
though
tart
a
very
nice
version
and
definitely
a
bit
less
acetic
than
most
highly
recommended
good
night
taste
is
actually
quite
nice
saving
this
beer
carbonation
would
make
it
a
stellar
beer
but
its
absolute
lack
of
it
makes
it
barely
above
the
average
lots
of
highs
and
lows
here
this
is
not
for
everyone
but
i
loved
it
another
great
beer
by
destruise
i
have
a
feeling
that
im
gonna
try
to
score
a
few
more
of
this
one
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
very
consistent
and
slightly
thickened
but
i
am
not
particularly
liking
the
lack
of
carbonation

myself

did
huge
thanks
to
ygtbsm94
for
sending
me
this
and
to
tyee
for
sharing
it
awhile
back
this
is
really
exceptional
stuff
not
like
any
other
beer
ive
ever
had
but
it
shows
some
characteristics
shared
with
labbaye
de
saint
bonchien
2005
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
unfortunately
quite
rare
well
well
worth
seeking
out
if
this
sounds
like
something
youd
enjoy
i
now
consider
it
one
of
the
great
soured
ales
in
the
world
d
all
day
in
the
summer
when
pouring
make
sure
to
include
the
yeast
in
the
glass
to
add
great
flavor
d
i
was
extremely
disappointed
with
this
one
ive
got
no
plans
to
seek
this
one
out
again
d
amazing
drinkability
this
is
super
rare
but
damn
good
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
but
the
rarity
cuts
it
down
a
bit
grab
of
rodenbach
until
then
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
has
a
good
amount
of
cherries
along
with
oak
tart
fruit
and
some
musky
funk
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
and
tart
flavors
there
is
a
very
subtle
manure
presence
clean
crisp
body
suits
the
style
well
dry
acidic
finish
another
delicious
brew
from
struise
near
perfect
d
this
one
goes
down
smooth
although
it
should
be
sipped
like
a
fine
wine
pours
dark
reddish
brown
with
no
head
smells
sour
alcoholic
and
of
dark
fruits
lots
of
yeast
in
the
bottom
taste
is
not
as
sour
as
the
smell
its
sweet
with
lots
of
plum
and
dark
berry
maybe
a
little
cherry
alcohol
is
only
barely
prevalent
but
still
more
than
id
have
expected
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
taste
plum
maybe
even
plum
wine
i
cant
pinpoint
what
but
this
beer
really
does
make
me
love
it
with
every
sip
overall
not
bad
seriously
not
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
had
but
none
the
less
it
was
still
very
solid
i
would
have
no
issue
with
trying
this
one
again
any
day
and
i
am
glad
i
have
a
few
left
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
kulminator
in
antwerp
served
in
a
de
struise
goblet
the
beer
was
murky
brownred
color
with
a
thin
wet
head
the
smell
was
very
good
for
a
flanders
wild
ale
lots
of
vinegary
sourness
but
complemented
by
sweet
cherry
and
wood
the
taste
was
sour
to
the
point
of
lip
pucker
but
you
could
imagine
quite
a
bit
of
fruit
flavors
maybe
apple
cider
as
well
i
liked
this
a
lot
but
the
drinkability
score
has
to
be
average
at
best
as
the
acidity
keeps
you
from
drinking
too
fast
very
recommended
drinkability
oh
so
drinkable
i
was
thinking
about
cracking
bottle
after
bottle
this
beer
was
sampled
at
the
kulminator
in
antwerp
in
a
struise
tulip
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
iced
tea
like
color
with
a
decent
head
that
receeded
quickly
nose
had
some
definite
sour
cherry
notes
and
a
tart
character
taste
was
wonderful
cherry
taste
was
fresh
but
yet
there
was
a
wood
character
from
the
aging
nice
sour
tone
all
through
the
beer
made
this
one
hard
to
put
down
d
i
have
limited
experience
with
this
style
and
i
wasnt
expecting
much
beside
something
very
sour
and
tart
the
complexities
of
this
blew
me
away
very
refreshing
this
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
red
hue
to
it
there
is
no
head
what
so
ever
the
smell
to
me
is
of
sour
cherries
but
with
a
sweet
smell
mixed
in
there
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sour
and
yet
creamy
the
sourness
isnt
over
powering
at
all
ive
certainly
had
more
tartsour
beers
than
what
this
offers
i
also
get
hints
of
citrus
grapefruit
taste
in
there
its
really
crisp
and
doesnt
much
of
an
after
taste
in
terms
of
a
flemish
sour
beer
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
dark
ruby
highlights
when
held
close
to
the
light
no
head
whatsoever
even
when
coaxed
while
pouring
smells
of
sour
cherries
prunes
slight
fusel
alcohol
in
the
background
and
maybe
some
phenolic
in
there
as
well
tastes
incredible
lots
of
sour
cherries
but
not
over
the
top
lactic
like
some
others
a
bit
of
caramel
malt
midway
through
some
more
sour
then
a
bit
of
alcohol
then
some
more
sour
leaving
a
slight
puckering
in
the
finish
vinous
flavors
throughout
medium
in
body
with
a
sticky
mouth
carbonation
is
just
about
non
existent
still
almost
this
might
need
some
age
to
develop
some
carbonation
i
do
have
time
as
the
bottle
says
it
is
best
before

to

was
mostly
sour

some
sweet

seemed
to
come
in
as
well
sourness
and
oak
in
the
taste
but
unfortunately
there
was
also
some
metallic
flavors
too
maybe
im
missing
the
big
deal
with
this
one
but
it
just
wasnt
that
great
to
me
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
try
one
of
these
recently
and
was
just
overwhelmed
this
might
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
wish
i
could
get
my
hands
on
some
more
it
was
served
in
a

had

was

incredible
aroma
an
extremely
earthy

pleasant

it
had

also
pungent
with
cherry
and
apple
with
some
sour
tart
vinegar
in
the
finish
almost
too
sour
for
me
and
i
didnt
find
it
very
enjoyable
i
guess
i
know
now
to
stay
away
from
this
style
it
is
really
not
for
me
despite
being
flat
this
beer
is
rich
tasty
i
am
actually
quite
surprise
how
good
this
beer
is
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
rich
mouthfeel
really
helps
here
hopefully
i
can
get
a
hold
of
a
carbonated
sample
of
this
brew
as
i
have
a
feeling
the
carbonation
would
make
this
beer
quite
stellar
i
certainly
got
hung
up
on
the
lack
of
carbonation
at
first
but
the
more
i
taste
this
beer
the
more
impressed
i
am
by
its
complexity
and
balance
i
still
think
some
noticeable
if
not
effervescent
carbonation
would
put
this
over
the
top
though
i
actually
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
at
first
but
it
has
really
grown
on
me
and
in
fact
really
needs
to
breath
a
bit
before
it
comes
into
its
own
the
first
thought
that
popped
into
my
head
when
i
tasted
it
was
how
rich
it
was
it
started
with
a
toffee
like
malt
flavor
not
overly
sweet
or
cloying
but
just
enough
young
beer
in
the
blend
to
balance
the
sourness
or
acetic
character
of
the
older
portion
the
fruit
profile
also
changed
from
that
of
the
aroma
it
had
more
of
a
spiced
citrus
and
raisins
flavor
the
finish
seemed
to
last
forever
it
consisted
of
vanilla
woodsy
phenols
wild
bliss
and
a
sweet
and
sour
tug
of
war
that
made
me
want
more
and
more
i
think
this
beer
will
age
to
20
years

the
gorgeous

gave

high

for
this
beer

i
found
it
to
have
a

aftertaste
and
a
little
harsh
on
the
way
down
i
like
my

bottle
of

way
more
i
was
a
little
shocked
by
the
fact
that
there
was
almost
no
head
to
this
beer
almost
none
and
it
was
poured
from
a
freshly
opened
bottle
just
a
light
brown
skim
around
the
edges

is
a
murky
brown
pond
of

nose

beautiful
and
packed
with

this

feel
is
soft

full
and
wonderful
abruptly
sour
at
first
with
the
initial
sip
dry
and
sharp
with
lemon
zest
and
cherry
skins
all
over
the

there
is
a
nice
consistent
robust
feel
that
mixes
with
the
sour
to

incredible

the

was

i

some

have
livened

up
i
was
told
this

was
a

the

as

the

perhaps
the

mouthfeel

in

with
a

additionally
the
inherent
acidity
of
this
beer
stimulates
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
and
leaves
a
residual
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
between
quaffs
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
i
really
cant
find
any
fault
with
this
beer
however
there
are
other
flanders
oud
bruins
that
i
feel
are
more
nuanced
o
awesome
second
only
to
cuvée
des
jacobins
as
far
as
sours
ive
tried
overall
really
good
stuff
the
wine
barrel
aging
definitely
adds
lots
of
additional
complexity
to
the
beer
and
really
helps
to
put
it
in
the
upper
echelon
of
the
style
o
the
taste
and
smell
of
this
beer
is
outstanding
but
the
thick
fell
with
extremely
low
carbonation
makes
this
is
something
to
enjoy
occasionally
and
in
small
amounts
this
is
great
for
after
dinner
dark
opaque
reddish
brown
smell
and
taste
are
very
acidic
there
is
virtually
no
carbonation
and
that
really
hurts
the
overall
experience
more
carbonation
would
lighten
the
acidity
and
it
would
be
about
right
with
the
lack
of
carbonation
it
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
overall
the
year
in
the
cellar
has
added
some
more
funk
and
possibly
elevated
the
peat
and
smoke
character
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
and
its
unique
in
that
it
tastes
foreign
no
american
renditions
ive
had
carry
these
types
of
flavors
cheers
b
o
im
used
to
sours
from
rr
this
is
different
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
o
id
like
to
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
has
a
unique
aroma
but
the
wine
barrel
presence
just
reminds
me
of
why
i
dont
drink
wine
its
an
interesting
combination
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
overall
had
no
idea
this
was
a
sour
when
i
opened
the
bottle
and
poured
it
boy
was
i
surprised
when
i
smelled
this
one
big
fan
of
sours
and
this
one
is
in
the
upper
echelon
highly
recommend
that
you
pick
this
one
up
if
you
can
d
besides
being
lackluster
to
look
at
and
lacking
carbonation
not
a
bad
brew
glad
the
wood
is
there
with
the
all
this
acid
really
starts
to
grow
on
you
as
you
consume
i
would
recommend
this
to
my
sourhead
friends
o
quite
a
complex
flanders
oud
bruin
and
offers
plenty
the
coffee
hit
is
interesting
given
the
fact
that
the
beer
was
aged
in
old
red
wine
barrels
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
more
influence
of
red
wine
this
is
a
very
heavy
fob
and
may
not
suit
all
it
takes
the
standard
style
to
a
new
level
its
more
like
wine
than
beer
and
i
like
it
o
man
i
poured
a
glass
of
this
and
i
dont
know
if
im
going
to
finish
the
glass
much
less
the
beer
too
bad
i
like
this
style
a
little
too
much
maybe
lots
of
spicebooze
and
maybe
could
have
used
a
bit
more
fruit
to
complement
the
slight
acidity
nice
but
just
a
little
overcooked
for
me
o
this
beer
was
a
crazy
surprise
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
good
but
i
didnt
know
it
was
going
to
be
this
good
and
this
unique
this
is
the
definition
of
a
barrelaged
sour
it
makes
it
even
better
that
it
has
some
local
norwegian
history
attached
to
it
haandbryggeriets
norwegian
wood
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
haandbakk
not
so
much
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
grapejuice
like
which
you
experience
after
a
completely
unexciting
pour
with
nearly
zero
head
the
taste
is
okay
but
far
from
exceptional
i
bought
this
hoping
for
a
lot
but
was
sorely
disappointed
medium
body
upper
carbonation
level
dry
and
lingering
on
the
palate
nice
oud
bruin
pretty
aggressive
profile
but
a
fun
sour
experience
othe
smell
and
flavor
profile
were
outstanding
with
nice
balance
between
oak
and
fruit
and
sour
and
sweet
the
finish
lasted
forever
too
the
beer
loses
major
points
for
the
complete
lack
of
carbonation
but
i
am
willing
to
give
this
another
shot
because
if
i
could
find
a
correctly
carbonated
bottle
this
would
move
up
quite
a
few
notches
overall
45
haandbakk
is
a
very
interesting
tasty
brew
it
is
a
rarity
in
that
it
is
a
strong
sour
ale
impressively
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
allowing
haandbakks
outstanding
tart
sour
winey
flavors
and
mellow
woody
tones
stand
out
unimpeded
this
ale
is
unique
among
sours
i
have
had
though
i
would
not
say
its
anywhere
near
the
top
of
that
heap
very
good
nonetheless
bottle
poured
a
deep
hazy
red
color
ale
with
a
small
bubbly
head
with
minimal
retention
and
no
lacing
aroma
consists
of
deep
sour
notes
with
light
tart
cherry
notes
also
perceptible
and
some
quite
funky
ester
taste
is
a
mix
between
deep
sour
and
tart
cherry
notes
with
light
smoke
notes
and
some
barnyard
notes
also
detectable
body
is
full
with
limited
filtration
and
low
carbonation
quite
extreme
though
acidity
level
is
balanced
not
something
i
would
have
everyday
bit
interesting
nonetheless
d
very
good
delicious
and
drinkable
8
alcohol
is
not
present
at
all
id
love
another
and
would
buy
again
i
dont
want
it
to
end
huge
vinous
and
fruity
flavors
balanced
against
balsamic
notes
excellent
example
of
the
style
one
of
my
favorites
glad
this
is
kind
of
a
sleeper
hit
and
hangs
around
for
a
bit
on
shelves
o
an
excellent
contemplative
ale
a
rewarding
sipper
highly
recommended
overall
so
i
actually
think
its
good
to
drink
not
my
favorite
but
nothing
close
to
bad
a
lot
going
on
and
maybe
some
of
the
flavors
arent
my
favorite
no
vinegar
which
i
love
i
really
like
this
beer
its
frankly
a
little
weird
with
the
chocolatey
brown
flavors
along
with
the
pretty
intense
sour
characteristics
but
i
really
like
it
ive
only
had
this
old
vintage
though
found
it
at
a
random
store
for
about
8
bucks
seems
like
that
was
a
good
deal
o
this
is
a
great
flanders
oud
bruin
haandbryggerriet
has
really
done
this
unique
style
justice
with
this
brew
i
would
have
no
trouble
recommending
this
to
fans
of
the
style
this
one
is
on
the
level
with
the
sour
and
tart
woody
funk
permeating
the
experience
those
mature
cherries
are
in
the
mix
as
well
this
is
the
style
at
its
best
you
could
certainly
do
a
lot
worse
but
itd
be
pretty
difficult
to
do
a
lot
better
the
price
is
high
but
the
experience
merits
it
nice
job
worth
the
coin
kind
of
disapointed
in
this
it
tastes
almost
like
a
sour
smoked
porter
but
at
first
that
isnt
obvious
it
starts
sweet
like
black
cherries
from
out
of
nowhere
come
little
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
and
smoked
malt
which
turn
out
to
be
very
complimentary
to
the
style
the
beer
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
exteremly
low
carbonation
however
low
carbonation
alone
isnt
going
to
stop
this
masterpiece
this
is
just
great
beer
thanks
mrmiles
for
the
opportunity
c
o
a
brewery
that
id
never
heard
of
a
name
i
cant
pronounce
a
beer
that
i
didnt
expect
and
yet
a
palate
that
i
absolutely
adored
thats
haandbakk
the
natural
tastes
that
are
found
in
this
bottle
would
leave
any
flanders
fan
deeply
satisfied
what
a
superb
beer
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
spritzy
and
soft
on
the
tongue
haandbakk
pours
a
light
bodied
dark
cherry
wood
brown
in
color
with
no
or
lacing
even
in
a
somewhat
still
pour
the
smells
is
of
sour
cherries
oak
soured
dark
fruits
plum
and
red
wine
barrel
the
flavors
are
nice
too
you
get
plenty
of
red
wine
barrel
oak
tart
cherry
and
sweet
grape
it
is
as
interesting
as
can
be
for
the
style
and
has
a
nice
although
moderate
level
of
sourness
the
least
impressive
part
of
this
beer
are
the
body
and
mouthfeel
it
poured
almost
flat
and
drinks
flat
almost
like
a
still
lambic
tis
definitely
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
and
desirability
of
this
beer
good
flavor
or
not
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
for
what
it
is
but
it
could
be
remarkable
if
it
had
the
proper
body
thinmedium
mouthfeel
sour
character
is
quite
present
but
not
overbearing
acidic
from
fermentation
not
carbonation
not
scorching
to
the
palate
good
stuff
super
unique
tastes
fantastic
a
wonderful
twostage
sock
to
the
face
that
is
equally
complex
and
variegated
on
each
end
up

roasted

barley
thats
nutty
and
biscuity
like
a
traditional
english
brown
in
the
back
intensely
sweet
and
tart
lactic
acid
cherries
and
apples
the
stages
are
remarkably
distinct
which
mandates
slow
sipping
and
the
overall
effect
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
well
balanced
beers
ive
had
in
ages
o
nicely
balanced
oude
bruin
worth
a
try
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
enough
if
you
have
access
get
it
for
the
price
it
is
amazing
and
for
being
a
year
past
its
stated
best
before
date
i
think
it
was
even
better
than
the
last
time
i
had
it
o
overall
this
a
great
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
if
you
like
oud
bruins
or
just
sours
in
general
i
wouldnt
pass
this
up
o
this
is
a
complex
and
unusual
beer
a
nice
blend
of
sour
and
bitter
which
i
would
like
to
have
seen
balanced
with
some
more
sweetness
but
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
for
true
beer
advocates
skål
wonderful
brew
from
haand
this
is
a
complex
delightful
and
exciting
beer
that
gives
something
unique
to
the
drinker
overall
my
experience
with
this
beer
was
a
downward
spiral
starting
with
a
pretty
nice
color
and
nose
and
tumbling
to
unpleasant
tastes
and
feelings
given
the
rave
reviews
by
others
id
be
willing
to
try
this
again
but
not
for
12
i
had
a
similar
experience
with
wild
thing
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
very
good
and
smooth
i
was
super
impressed
with
this
one
especially
because
i
didnt
know
anything
about
it
ahead
of
time
would
definitely
have
it
again
a
nice
well
balanced
flemish
old
brown
imaging
a
fat
ripe
hard
cheese
would
be
excellent
with
it
overall
a
nice
sour
beer
it
has
enough
flavor
to
counteract
the
strength
of
the
sour
o
surprisingly
smoky
really
unique
enjoyable
sour
beer
cheers
o
the
bright
fruity
notes
blend
with
some
nice
funk
hints
and
a
dry
finish
with
hints
of
wood
really
add
some
nice
depth
to
this
beer
the
beer
takes
on
more
vinous
qualities
and
the
body
thins
as
it
opens
up
the
bitter
aspirin
quality
fades
into
more
of
a
tartness
as
the
beer
opens
aswell
definitely
one
of
the
most
complex
flanders
ive
had
not
into
sours
but
i
can
get
down
with
the
complexity
here
and
appreciate
it
this
is
exactly
what
i
hoped
it
would
be
the
examples
ive
had
from
this
style
tend
to
be
more
vinegarforward
and
the
barrel
aging
clearly
mellowed
this
one
out
a
bit
wish
i
had
picked
up
one
to
cellar
this
was
quite
a
treat
o
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
this
one
at
times
i
loved
it
at
others
it
was
only
slightly
above
average
then
again
when
it
comes
down
to
it
id
definitely
buy
it
again
cheers
overall
a
wellmade
flanders
for
certain
very
unique
in
the
sheer
amount
of
roast
and
cocoa
from
the
malting
plus
the
wine
barrel
adds
a
nice
woodyvinous
note
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
ill
be
sure
to
pick
several
up
next
time
it
is
available
overall
this
is
a
unique
flandersheavy
on
the
barrel
flavors
almost
smoky
but
still
sour
not
my
favorite
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
it
stands
out
from
the
rest
very
solid
one
of
the
better
oud
bruins
ive
had
an
amazing
beer
a
must
try
if
you
like
sour
beer
o
good
stuff
but
still
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
little
off
maybe
i
just
wanted
more
sour
and
less
oatmeal
cookie
different
strokes
i
guess
overall
i
am
very
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
try
a
beer
i
have
coveted
for
quite
some
time
an
enjoyable
brew
i
would
have
this
again
definitely
recommend
trying
this
one
at
least
once
not
my
personal
favorite
sour
but
i
can
see
a
lot
of
potential
for
this
to
be
someones
favorite
and
id
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
understand
why
o
this
is
quite
the
creative
interpretation
of
the
old
farmhouse
wilds
of
norway
i
have
one
more
to
cellar
and
look
forward
to
revisiting
it
in
the
future
opened
a
bottle
of
this
beer
to
split
with
a
friend
of
mine
last
night
the
pour
was
of
a
reddish
deep
brown
with
no
head
on
it
and
no
lacing
in
side
looks
similar
to
a
wine
the
smell
of
wood
cherries
and
plenty
of
funk
on
the
nose
the
taste
right
from
the
fridge
was
sour
and
gave
off
some
elements
of
fresh
tobacco
and
tart
cherry
in
the
aftertaste
as
the
beer
warmed
i
feel
that
it
started
to
become
a
little
more
balanced
the
flavors
didnt
transition
as
much
as
when
it
was
colder
the
funk
became
less
dominant
as
it
warmed
also
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
smooth
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
remains
a
sipper
based
on
how
tart
it
is
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
attempt
at
a
flanders
red
not
my
style
of
beer
per
se
but
this
beer
was
good
and
worth
recommending
to
people
who
like
a

after
reading
the
label
i
thought
i
could
pick
out
something
akin
to
rhubarb
bone
dry
finish
to
accentuate
a
much
rounder
fuller
body
than
typical
for
style
big

brash

its
not
out

place
it
all
works
together
a
real
treat

initial

kind

strawberry

flavor
is
sour

the
sherry

very

god
i
was
recommended
this
and
there
was
one
left
just
sitting
on
the
shelf
i
had
to
shell
out
the
ten
dollars
to
try
it
i
feel
pretty
boss
sipping
this
brew
continuously
via
my
duvel
tulip
this
is
up
there
for
one
of
my
favorite
brews
as
of
this
point
its
easily
top
ten
worthy
i
cannot
believe
the
chocolate
flavor
caught
me
off

going
through
this
bottle
far

quickly
awesome

happy
i
took

to

with
this
one
a
buddy
snagged
it
for
me
from
the
whole
foods
in
roseville
ca
gotta
say
that
i
was
quite
pleased
a
really
nice
example
of
an
oud
bruin
surprisingly
my
sour
loving
wife
was
not
a
fan
though
claims
there
is
some
weird
flavor
she
is
not
fond
of
this
brew
pours
a
murky
cherry

leaves
behind
a

i
would
buy
it
again

poured

body

might
have
poured
it
a

cold
but
the
head
was
still
a
little
fizzy
aromas
of
bran
muffins
cherry
cola
milk
chocolate
light
vinegar
and

second
pour
has
a
bit
of
ferrous
character
to
the
nose
flavor
is
interesting
to
say
the
least
the
aroma
suggests
a
malty
oud
bruin
style
beer
but
it
tastes
like
an
intentionally
soured
stout
big
helpings
of
roasty
and
toasty
malts
a
firm
acetic
sourness
and
notes
of
dried
fruit
a
nice
surprise
since
i
cant
stand
oud
bruins
that
taste
like
rotten
dr
pepper
dry
but
not
astringent
on
the
palate
lengthy
finish
sorta
thin
pretty
good
but
the
dark
malt
sourness
thing
isnt
quite
up
my
alley
overall
is
amazing
and
i
dont
really
know
what
i
would
change
this
in
any
way
really
like
haand
beers
and
this
might
be
my
favorite
yet
pours
an
almost
opaque
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
1
inch
light
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
spots
of
lace
slide
back
down
into
the
beer
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
red
wine
vinegar
oak
and
funkmust
taste
is
exactly
the
same
with
the
red
winebalsalmic
vinegar
oak
wood
and
funkmust
the
oak
flavors
are
very
noticeable
on
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
sour
and
acidic
twang
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
pretty
flat
which
makes
this
beer
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
the
sourness
level
would
be
better
with
more
carbonation
present
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
nice
oak
notes
in
the
taste
but
the
carbonation
issue
leaves
something
to
be
desired
this
bottle
was
a
little
heavier
on
the
oak
than
my
previous
two
experiences
but
it
was
still
a
standout
beer
great
version
of
this
style
and
one
you
can
take
some
time
to
admire
very
nice
i
personally
would
stick
with
a
monks
cafe
over
this
a
little
more
readily
available
and
not
as
alcoholy
a
little
pricey
as
well
per
bottle
other
than
the
boozynail
polishy
qualities
to
it
its
pretty
much
textbook
flanders
oud
bruin
o
phenomenal
mashup
of
a
flanders
and
a
funky
wild
yeast
fermentation
a
truly
well
done
ale
edit
let
this
beer
sit
in
the
glass
and
breathe
a
little
bit
this
is
about
45
minutes
later
and
this
beer
is
so
much
better
once
it
spends
a
little
bit
of
the
time
out
of
the
bottle
the
sourness
is
better
and
the
end
of
the
sip
has
this
nice
sweetness
to
it
that
sits
in
my
mouth
for
a
while
i
am
moving
my
taste
from
a
4
to
a
4
5
and
overall
from
a
3
5
to
a
4
od
i
could
only
have
one
but
damn
it
was
tasty
a
style
im
becoming
more
fond
of
as
the
sour
and
sweet
elements
were
balanced
well
and
played
off
each
other
nicely
making
it
easier
to
drink
if
theres
any
beer
that
should
hold
up
well
after
almost
five
years
its
an
oak
barrelaged
8
5
flanders
oud
bruin
and
wild
ale
hybrid
this
quite
the
experience
but
its
almost
too
intense
for
all
500
ml
to
be
enjoyable
my
advice
find
someone
with
an
adventurous
palate
to
share
it
with
o
surprisingly
good
ill
buy
this
if
i
see
it
again
well
i
got
this
one
in
an
awesome
beeritforward
from
alewatcher
who
btw
is
the
man
great
friggin

ive
tried
and
removedreplaced
some
beers
received
in
trading
from
my
wants

curiosity
having
been
satisfied
however
this
one
im
going
to
leave
on
my
wants
list
because
its
friggin
fantastic
it
really
seems
more
like
a
wild
ale
to
me
than
any
other
style
but
then
im
no
expert
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
i
really
do
love
this
beer
thanks
alewatcher
in
short
this
would
be
worth
an
a
rating
if
it
wasnt
for
the
disappointingly
unpleasant
finish
at
8
abv
i
found
this
beer
to
be
remarkably
drinkable
haandbakk
competes
with
the
best
of
the
flanders
oud
bruins
d
well
balanced
great
at
displaying
the
beer
behind
the
funksour
as
well
as
the
dark
malts
are
actually
very
detectable
great
peek
at
the
style
drinks
well
not
overly
sour

a

and

more
please
a
good
sour
ale
which
while
the
tartness
is
high
is
very
nice
d
medium
plus
d
exceptional
drinkable
for
the
style
overall
this
is
an
extremely
tasty
oud
bruin
though
the
aroma
is
a
bit
week
the
flavors
are
layered
very
well
and
has
good
drinkability
all
things
considered
i
would
recomend
trying
this
for
any
sour
lover
verdict
very
good
and
almost
worth
the
high
price
you
can
find
better
in
the
style
but
this
is
a
wonderful
and
unique
beer
worth
trying

this
should
have
been
on

im
really
enjoying
how
this
is
changing
as
it
warms
thank
you
for
the
chance
to
try
this
one
im
really
liking
it
alot
thank
you
richard
for
all
of
the
beers
you
sent
me
it
really
has
been
a
treat
this
might
be
one
that
would
be
interesting
to
taste
again
in
a
year
or
two
not
one
that
i
would
drink
now
too
heavy
on
the
vinegar
character
flavors
just
dont
seem
integrated
and
the
sour
is
not
sour
there
is
no
brightness
or
pucker
factor
perhaps
a
bit
of
time
will
integrate
this
one
well
see
very
good
a
very
nice
approach
to
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
mild
funk
dry
finish
acetic
and
lacitc
sourness
its
an
easy
drinking
sour
but
dry
on
the
finish
id
have
it
again
its
quite
good
this
beer
pours
an
intriguing
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
cocoa
colored
head
that
leaves
the
party
very
quickly
the
color
is
awesome
and
immediately
scores
high
points
one
swirl
wafes
funk
and
chocolate
covered
cherries
into
the
room
the
smell
matches
the
color
perfectly
and
is
almost
exactly
what
i
expected
i
get
oak
cherries
vinegar
sweet
mild
chocolate
theres
so
much
going
on
and
i
love
every
sip
its
light
and
dark
at
the
same
time
where
its
so
drinkable
but
the
depth
of
flavors
makes
me
sit
and
think
about
it
every
time
i
drink
the
abv
is
nowhere
to
be
found
and
id
love
to
see
how
much
further
this
brew
could
go
if
i
lay
a
few
down
for
a
while
will
definitely
revisit
again
d
extremely
drinkable

on

on
there
are
things
going

that
really
get
the
gears
turning
and
a
lot
of
them
are
tastes
and
smells
ive
never
experienced
before
also
a
lot
of
shared
characteristics
between
this
beer
and
really
oldworld
wines
tar
like
road
paving
in
the
country
is
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
a
lot
of
dark
not
roasty
dark
flavors
going
on
everything
is
balanced
well
with
the
vinegar
notes
playing
with
the
sweet
and
spicy
notes
in
a
very
natural
uncontrived
way
taste
is
complex
and
a
bit
foreign
this
beer
is
not
for
beginners
that
being
said
this
was
not
to
me
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
even
though
i
am
a
wild
and
sour
lover
i
was
impressed
but
not
left
wanting
another
the
overall
complexity
is
almost
too
much
for
words
when
you
find
it
buy
two
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
it
werent
so
expensive
10
99
per
bottle
d
an
enjoyable
beer
now
but
will
probably
be
better
with
some
time
d
pretty
good
beer
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
a
solid
beer
really
reminds
me
of
a
soured
bottle
of
wine
i
heard
that
this
was
like
consecrations
twin
and
i
agree
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
that
beer
id
pick
this
up
again
if
i
saw
some
but
i
wont
go
nuts
trying
to
obtain
it
over
a
solid
example
of
the
style
that
being
said
and
given
its
somewhat
large
format
i
would
definitely
say
this
is
a
one
and
done
endeavor
world
class
in
my
opinion
i
dont
drink
a
lot
of
sour
ales
but
this
beer
has
cracked
my
top
10
all
time
brews
regardless
of
style
i
didnt
want
it
to
ever
end
i
had
to
drive
a
few
hours
to
get
this
and
this
bottle
has
convinced
me
to
pick
some
up
on
every
trip
truly
an
amazing
beer
overall
i
think
it
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
is
off
the
charts
but
definitely
above
average
and
something
i
would
drink
again
nice
complex
beer
unlike
anything
else
ive
had
great
mouthfeel
with
a
bright
body
plenty
of
carbonation
great
beer
dark
brown
pour
with
a
dark
cherry
red
tint
in
the
light
short
lived
beige
head
smell
is
nice
musty
cherry
funk
quite
nice
taste
follows
suite
with
the
cherries
nicely
subdued
something
about
this
really
clicks
with
me
mouthfeel
is
smooth
light
carbonation
and
the
higher
abv
does
not
really
make
itself
too
noticeable
id
love
to
be
able
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
outstanding
bruin
pours
a
rusty
red
with
a
light
tan
head
smell
is
sweet
caramel
along
with
a
very
strong
lactic
and
acetic
presence
taste
is
very
nice
with
chery
and
oak
coming
in
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
of
a
drawback
as
the
acetic
character
is
quite
strong
drinkability
is
similarly
affected
do
like
the
creaminess
of
the
body
d
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
my
favourite
from
the
haand
bryggeriet
so
far
complex
delicious
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
poured
out
of
a
500
mil
bottle
into
a
flute
dark
coffee
and
cherry
juice
appearance
with
very
little
head
though
that
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
drinking
vessel
smells
of
cherry
grapes
maybe
pinot
noir
given
the
cherry
scent
oak
and
coffeechocolate
extremely
tart
and
sour
up
front
melds
into
a
nice
rich
toasty
chocolate
flavor
then
moulds
into
a
belgian
dubbel
yeasty
sort
of
note
then
the
sour
comes
back
with
a
vengeance
accompanied
by
cherry
juice
fantastic
and
complex
beer
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
little
hot
for
8
percent
d
not
overly
sour
or
tart
a
very
nice
flanders
that
is
complex
yet
extremely
drinkable
very
strong
effort
from
norway
pours
a
nice
mirky
crimson
brown
with
a
soft
white
head
smell
is
complex
with
dark
cherry
oak
and
trace
basalmic
vinegar
tastes
like
a
sweet
tart
with
fruit
and
a
throat
clenching
finish
awesome
reminds
me
of
rodenbach
and
consecration
but
even
better
the
oak
tannin
is
prominently
deep
and
robust
big
and
rich
mouthfeel
with
the
combo
tart
and
sweetness
along
with
prickly
carbonation
and
lasting
acetic
bite
lots
of
sediment
at
the
end
this
is
so
enjoyable
and
worth
seeking
out
overall
this
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
but
this
one
of
the
few
sour
styles
that
i
am
not
so
fond
of
mouthfeel
is
good
well
carbonated
but
a
bit
thicker
than
i
would
like
it
to
be
since
it
is
not
as
airy
on
the
palate
this
also
brings
down
its
drinkability
though
there
certainly
wont
be
any
problem
finishing
it
d
this
one
is
keeping
me
intrigued
im
no
expert
on
oud
bruins
but
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
brew
highly
recommended
if
you
are
interested
in
sour
styles
a
good
beer
that
is
teetering
on
the
edge
of
greatness
thanks
again
mikeyv35
d
average
d
a
really
nice
oud
bruin
that
balances
the
vinegar
component
well
i
would
definitely
pick
up
another
one
of
these
awesomely
drinkable
and
one
ive
taken
for
granted
that
weve
had
so
readily
available
in
springfield
mo
for
over
a
year
now
go
norway
i
love
that
i
have
2
more
in
the
cellar
that
will
hopefully
turn
more
sour
with
some
time
d
one
of
the
most
pleasantly
drinkable
flanders
oud
bruins
ive
tried
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
it
was
very
drinkable
for
a
sour
ale
i
still
dont
know
how
to
pronounce
the
name
of
this
brewery
why
cant
they
all
be
as
easy
as
stone
or
bells
d
off
the
hook
for
those
with
the
cojones
to
handle
a
powerhouse
of
a
sour
beer
like
this
one
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
a
finger
of
offwhitetan
head
that
left
some
minute
lacing
on
the
glass
nice
aroma
on
this
one
with
the
wood
notes
coming
out
first
followed
up
by
a
pleasant
sour
and
earthiness
with
maybe
a
touch
of
lemon
and
cherry
taste
is
very
nice
a
good
dose
of
sourness
is
there
but
its
not
bracing
or
overbearing
with
a
solidly
sweet
and
bready
malt
backing
theres
even
an
underlying
chocolate
taste
that
keeps
things
very
interesting
which
melds
nicely
with
the
oak
and
sour
not
much
in
the
way
of
funk
in
this
brew
but
i
like
that
in
a
flanders
style
ale
light
lemon
and
cherry
that
were
in
the
nose
can
be
found
in
the
taste
as
well
as
a
dash
of
vinegar
somewhat
sweet
at
first
but
a
dry
and
sour
finish
this
is
a
great
starter
sour
much
akin
to
the
likes
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
mediumfull
bodied
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
not
too
light
and
not
too
prickly
overall
this
is
a
solid
flanders
oud
bruin
and
definitely
a
great
place
to
start
if
youre
new
to
sours
not
overly
tart
and
tonguetrashing
but
still
sour
and
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
overall
a
really
good
sour
beer
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
and
a
must
try
for
the
sour
fans
very
enjoyable
beer
here
not
too
sour
but
fully
flavored
would
be
a
great
entry
level

in
my
opinion

a
solid

the

through
i
loved
this
beer
cant

to

on

this
is
a
very
nice

and
a
very
enjoyable
sipper
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
dthis
is
a
decent
flanders
red
overall
the
sourness
has
perhaps
faded
a
bit
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
oak
aged
sour
what
is
clear
about
this
brew
is
that
it
has
a
higher
abvwhich
is
blatant
in
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
d
awesome
if
this
wasnt
12

bottle

dthis
is
a

hot
and
the
alcohol
seems
to
show
a
little
more
than
i
would
prefer
the
boddy
is
solid
but
sits
in
the
stomach
d
i
can
see
why
this
is
a
highly
regarded
brew
and
while
it
may
not
be
for
me
i
have
to
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
strong
and
upfront
with
massive
unapologetic
flavors
this
is
no
doubt
a
bold
beer
feel
is
amazing
and
helps
to
meld
the
outherwise
out
of
control
sourness
highly
recommended
if
you
like
sours
but
remember
this
may
be
unlike
any
other
youve
had
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
again
not
sure
what
vintage
the
first
one
i
had
was
its
nice
to
see
what
this
beer
is
like
as
it
warms
to
room
temp
too
the
first
time
i
had
it
was
in
the
negatives
outside
pours
blood
red
with
a
thin
tan
head
looks
pretty
normal
for
an
oud
bruin
a
little
clearer
than
i
expected
but
looks
alright
the
smell
has
old
strawberries
which
ive
come
to
know
in
wild
bacteria
but
isnt
exactly
my
favorite
smell
in
these
with
eggs
and
vinegar
not
quite
as
vinegary
as
some
in
the
class
again
doesnt
stand
out
isnt
particularly
bad
and
it
has
the
right
kind
of
characteristics
but
not
my
favorite
the
taste
has
oranges
the
acidic
very
citric
part
with
a
slight
bready
toastiness
which
is
slightly
unexpected
and
nice
its
still
very
sour
very
acidic
but
not
very
tart
if
that
makes
sense
maybe
not
enough
sweetness
the
old
strawberries
come
back
which
remind
me
of
old
food
old
fruit
a
bit
of
old
cherries
and
surprisingly
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
wood
i
expected
a
little
more
of
that
pleasant
tartness
like
youngripe
cherries
and
strawberries
this
tastes
overripe
to
reiterate
blended
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
this
kind
of
works
towards
what
i
want
then
kind
of
falls
short
in
taste
finishes
very
acidic
its
actually
hard
to
tell
whether
its
sweet
or
dry
and
that
may
be
the
main
problem
the
body
is
nice
mediumfull
fuller
than
i
expected
moderate
carbonation
pleasant
for
the
style
overall
its
decent
i
would
maybe
have
it
again
definitely
wouldnt
pay
for
it
its
not
the
most
impressive
which
means
that
if
i
were
going
to
this
style
i
would
probably
go
to
something
new
or
something
else
that
i
like
better
i
think
it
may
have
been
a
little
young
or
couldve
used
some
blending
with
an
older
version
d
this
beer
has
everything
its
in
your
face
in
the
nose
but
subtle
in
the
nose
it
is
sweet
tart
and
sour
all
at
the
same
time
it
is
one
of
the
most
pleasant
beers
i
have
had
its
not
crazy
and
its
not
going
to
get
marks
for
that
but
it
will
get
marks
for
complexity
and
subtlety
its
wicked
to
be
honest
it
really
assaults
the
senses
and
i
dig
that
i
can
see
why
dave
is
all
about
this
beer
good
stuff
and
worth
the
price
of
admission
medium
bodied
with
prickly
carbonation
nice
creamy
texture
despite
the
sodalike
carbonation
which
i
enjoyed
very
very
dry
finish
really
tasty
and
surprisingly
drinkable
this
beer
sits
like
the
hindenburg
in
your
stomach
carbonation
is
average
mouthfeel
is
a
thick
for
the
style
drinkability
is
higher
than
nill
just
because
i
get
two
pours
out
of
this
and
can
finish
them
although
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
on
another
occasion
i
could
not
drink
a
second
bottle
i
dont
hate
myself
that
much
overall
a
great
sour
id
happily
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
sour
ales
oak
barrel
aging
gives
it
a
refined
body
introduced
this
to
a
friend
during
this
sitting
and
he
loved
it
even
more
amazing
was
when
i
had
smoked
pork
neck
with
a
sauce
made
from
this
beer
at
olympen
in
oslo
man
what
a
wonderful
beer
dont
serve
this
too
cold
pairs
very
well
with
food
this
style
generally
does
better
as
part
of
a
meal
in
my
experience
in
this
case
some
goat
gouda
and
a
fresh
baguette
this
is
very
nicely
drinkable
it
is
sour
enough
to
be
interesting
yet
not
so
sour
as
to
pucker
your
face
the
8
5abv
is
exceptionally
wellhidden
also
which
sure
doesnt
hurt
m
incredibly
lively
and
fizzy
d
this
was
a
really
nice
surprise
and
i
found
it
very
drinkable
for
a
style
that
even
with
the
best
examples
it
is
hard
to
drink
more
than
12
oz
of
heres
to
more
wild
norwegian

definitely
a
beer
worth
purchasing
d
an
interesting
beer
but
i
cant
help
but
think
how
much
more
i
liked
other
beers
of
the
style
like
goudenband
ill
check
back
on
this
batch
in
a
few
years
to
see
how
it
compares
then
but
for
now
this
is
one
and
done
for
me
d
i
am
definitely
new
to
the
style
but
can
find
appealing
elements
to
it
but
cant
get
past
the
acrid
acidity
i
enjoy
vinegar
and
a
good
balsamic
reduction
when
im
cooking
but
dont
find
it
all
that
pleasant
to
drink
i
really
loved
the
barrelaged
elements
of
the
beer
that
gave
it
the
earthywood
like
taste
a
good
representation
of
the
style
im
sure
the
sour
is
pleasant
too
tart
and
vinous
with
a
very
prominent
dark
fruit
presence
hints
of
plum
raisin
and
dark
cherry
with
a
dry
lactic
tart
sour
flavor
nice
earthy
oak
and
subtle
vanilla
balance
out
the
tart
and
sweet
notes
perfectly
while
this
beer
is
pretty
funky
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
the

is
excellently
masked
very
complex

dangerously

had

than
just

and
i
will
certainly
be
looking
for
more
overall
one
of
the
most
unique
and
intriguing
beers
on
the
planet
third
brew
ive
had
from
them
and
they
have
all
been
unique
and
enjoyable
at
the
least
and
fantastic
at
best
if
you
can
find
this
buy
it

would
have
with

thats
just
me
dreaming
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
the
acidity
makes
it
a
sipper
but
this
one
is
welcome
in
my
fridge
anytime

wow
what
a
fantastic
beer
i
love
the
all
the
nuances
here
and
the
deft
use
of
oak
pours
a
slightly
murky
brown
with
a
fair
head
of
very
tight
bubbles
very
nice
combo
of
tannic
oak
and
sour
fruit
in
the
nose
the
bottle
says
it
was
aged
in
oak
barrels
previously
used
for
sherry
and
rhubarb
wine
you
can
definitely
pick
up
some
sherry
notes
and
the
use
of
oak
that
still
carries
some
rhubarb
is
brilliant
the
vegetal
sourness
of
the
rhubarb
marries
beautifully
with
the
sourness
of
the
beer
and
the
tannins
from
the
barrel
the
taste
is
even
more
complex
and
intense
starts
out
fairly
soft
and
lightly
sour
and
then
the
tannins
from
the
oak
build
into
a
spicy
woody
crescendo
followed
by
a
blast
of
rhubarb
some
acetic
notes
and
late
barnyard
laced
with
more
wood
tang
just
superb
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
oaky
but
softer
than
you
might
think
with
the
oak
and
the
sourness
in
balance
and
a
touch
of
creaminess
to
offset
the
woody
blast
as
intense
as
this
beer
is
i
found
the
flavors
so
well
developed
if
not
subtle
that
i
could
keep
on
drinking
this
for
a
while
the
8
5
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
as
well
extremely
well
done
this
one
no
shortcuts
here
3
years
of
aging
in
barrels
with
character
shows
through
beautifully
bravo
pours
a
very
cloudy
brown
some
reddish
tint
to
it
thin
tan
head
forms
and
quickly
drops
to
a
thin
ring
no
lacing
on
the
glass
but
thats
expected
smell
is
great
very
intensely
sour
cherries
sugar
and
bready
sweetness
in
the
middle
oak
very
acidic
lemons
and
orange
berries
earthy
crazy
intense
taste
is
just
as
good
sour

up

very
earthy

crazy
good
oud
bruin
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
this
was
great
drinkability
is
good
excellent
balance
showing
almost
no
trace
of
its
8
5
abv
sourness
and
acidity
are
not
overpowering
yet
still
contribute
well
overall
a
great
flanders
brown
d
im
not
a
huge
sour
fan
which
costs
the
beer
some
points
on
that
alone
but
this
is
as
good
as
any
of
the
sours
that
ive
had
honestly
for
the
money
this
is
as
good
as
concecration
or
even
cuvee
de
tomme
just
cant
see
me
drinking
it
or
concecration
and
cuvee
de
tomme
for
that
matter
very
often
d
this
is
a
highly
addictive
style
the
sour
ales
are
growing
on
me
fast
and
this
one
was
great
only
wish
they
were
in
high
demand
in
this
part
of
the
country
d
the
alcohol
is
incredibly
well
hidden
i
had
a
bigger
problem
with
the
5
9
brian
boru
earlier
today
than
i
did
with
this
one
the
aftertaste
has
a
lot
of
wood
to
it
but
it
never
gets
to
be
too
much
the
carbonation
is
lively
but
not
bloaty
love
the
500ml
serving
size
too
d
an
allaround
excellent
beer
among
the
best
ive
had
of
this
or
similar
styles
haandbryggeriet
has
one
to
be
proud
of
with
haandbakk
high
strength
prevents
this
from
the
drinkability
it
might
have
were
it
in
the
6
ballpark
but
its
still
so
enjoyable
just
requires
more
time
or
sipping
partners
to
consume
definitely
recommended
great
beer
to
bring
along
bryce
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
good
example
of
a
flanders
and
a
great
introductory
sour
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
i
hope
more
of
this
makes
it
into
ga
i
dont
think
my
bottles
will
last
me
very
long
excellent
beer
to
preday
prefunk
for
a
day
of
sours
this
is
a
worldclass
oud
bruin
my
favorite
that
ive
tried
as
a
sour
period
this
one
is
a
success
i
would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
appreciates
a
nice
sour
or
wild
ale
overall
admittedly
im
just
starting
to
get
into
sour
ales
i
can
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
lot
more
than
the
avery
brabant
the
major
comparison
i
have
thus
far
is
that
its
very
close
to
the
jolly
pumpkin
la
roja
i
had
a
few
weeks
back
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
is
probably
more
suitable
for
sharing
the
next
time
i
drink
this
one
id
definitely
love
to
pair
it
with
some
good
soft
cheese
drinkability
a
fine
enjoyable
comparable
sour
recommend
provided
youre
a
fan
of

beers
500ml

damn
dark
dark
color
black
almost
maybe
small
tan
ring
of
bubbles
it
smells
like
wood
cherries
malts
hint
of
rubber
cement
smells
about
on
par
for
the
style
it
tastes
like
an
oud
bruin
but
very
subtle
slight
bit
of
sour
slight
bit
of
wood
and
and
it
seems
a
little
harsh
to
my
tongue
i
am
a
sucker
for
sour
beers
at
this
point
so
i
buckled
and
paid
the
high
price
tag
i
should
have
bought
a
la
folie
instead
a
nice
sour
ale
from
haandbryggeriet
pours
a
redwood
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
nose
has
tart
fruits
sweet
malts
oak
and
a
subtle
musty
funk
tatse
is
a
nice
balance
of
the
sweet
malts
and
tart
fruity
flavors
could
use
more
of
a
manurefamyard
presence
crisp
body
feels
full
on
the
palate
and
has
an
acidic
finish
good
stuff
this
is
a
truly
great
beer
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
just
blown
away
picked
this
one
up
on
my
trip
to
florida
as
i
had
heard
very
good
things
about
it
cracked
it
the
other
night
as
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
sour
served
chilled
in
a
tulip
this
one
was
consumed
on
03052009
the
pour
was
very
nice
with
a
rich
medium
brown
color
and
a
nice
light
tan
head
on
top
nearly
opaque
with
some
light
reddish
touches
to
the
sides
and
bottom
deep
horse
funk
on
the
nose
with
apple
vinegar
and
ripe
sour
apples
dominating
the
aroma
with
some
light
oak
notes
as
it
warmed
the
flavor
was
crisp
tart
and
very
full
ripe
apples
and
sour
fruits
just
ripping
through
the
mouth
puckeringly
good
here
with
a
great
carbonation
level
and
really
solid
body
all
around
some
nice
notes
of
oak
as
it
warms
and
a
rich
sour
ale
really
comes
to
life
overall
a
fantastic
beer
i
will
gladly
buy
again
drinkability
with
its
masked
alcohol
not
tasted
at
all
this
scores
incredibly
high
with
the
drinkability
with
its
only
retraction
being
the
lack
of
balance
between
the
tart
and
the
body
a
very
pleasant
surprise
excellent
stuff
this
rivals
any
very
good
flanders
red
ive
had
ill
be
buying
more
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
the
flavor
is
awesome
the
only
place
i
fault
this
beer
is
consistency
everytime
i
have
this
brew
it
always
tastes
slightly
different
i
figure
this
is
brew
is
done
in
small
batches
using
multiple
barrels
and
each
of
those
barrels
have
their
own
character
but
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
some
bottles
all
from
the
same
batch
have
been
more
sweet
and
fruity
more
sour
or
more
oaky
overall
very
tasty
overall
although
their
darkforce
imperial
wheat
stout
is
my
favorite
offering
this
may
take
second
place
it
is
a
very
interesting
sour
and
i
really
enjoy
what
the
oakaging
does
for
it
its
a
little
spendy
but
definitely
worth
it
my
only
regret
is
not
sharing
this
with
anyone
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
gorgeous
red
highlights
thick
lacing
clings
tightly
to
the
glass
smells
of
green
apples
sour
cherries
and
juicy
natural
funk
make
for
an
amazing
nose
first
sip
is
puckering
tart
the
green
apples
and
sour
cherries
combine
with
the
wild
yeast
to
create
an
incredible
taste
sherry
and
oak
flavors
support
this
beer
and
enhance
the
flavor
as
it
warms
the
sourness
increases
the
mouthfeel
really
stands
out
as
the
beer
treats
my
tongue
like
a
dance
floor
im
guessing
this
is
bottled
conditioned
i
am
grateful
norways
beer
is
better
than
her
politics
haandbakk
is
among
my
favorite
sour
ales
the
balance
of
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
makes
this
one
more
drinkable
than
many
of
the
lambics
ive
tasted
tasty
overall
i
thought
this
was
more
along
the
lines
of
an
oud
bruin
than
anything
and
a
good
one
it
was
pick
this
one
up
if
you
see
it
around
and
thanks
again
to
atlbeerdog
for
sharing
this
awesome
d
spectacularly
drinkable
i
am
quite
partial
to
flemmish
sour
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
ever
had
the
sour
spicy
aroma
is
spot
on
and
the
flavor
is
complex
and
satisfying
in
a
way
that
makes
me
truly
sorry
i
did
not
get
another
bottle
of
this
when
i
had
the
chance
batch
49
brewed
101006
without
a
doubt
this
is
exceptional
beer
that
has
been
brewed
with
the
utmost
care
and
skill
it
is
also
seems
like
a
fairly
unique
flavor
even
among
sours
not
that
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
have
sampled
too
many
the
beer
tastes
strongly
of
oak
and
is
very
tart
the
tartness
is
sour
cherry
with
a
vinous
character
i
had
a
small
glass
of
champagne
earlier
and
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
closer
to
that
than
to
a
lot
of
other
beers
you
can
just
really
taste
the
oak
barrel
and
that
oak
makes
things
quite
dry
the
pucker
is
much
more
complex
than
im
used
to
i
imagine
the
beer
would
age
incredibly
well
the
alcohol
isnt
felt
in
the
least
behind
the
enormous
tart
flavor
its
definitely
a
sipping
beer
i
have
no
idea
what
it
could
possibly
be
paired
with
foodwise
i
can
barely
taste
anything
but
the
beer
after
that
pucker
it
could
be
good
as
an
ingredient
in
a
dish
rather
than
a
pairing
its
an
expensive
beer
but
its
good
enough
to
justify
the
price
i
mean
im
not
going
to
go
out
and
buy
a
case
but
i
definitely
want
to
try
as
many
different
beers
from
this
brewery
as
possible
and
it
would
be
a
great
gift
to
any
fan
of
sours

it
poured
a
dark
brown
with
purple
highlights
and
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
turned
into
a
ring
the
nose
has
plums
a
load
of
sour
cherry
and
i
think
there
is
some
vanilla
the
taste
has
a
nice
tartness
without
being
puckering
there
is
a
lactic
twinge
had
a
sweetness
hidden
in
between
the
cherry
tart
start
and
finish
the
finish
is
real
dry
with
a
hint
of
lingering
cherry
overall
very
tasty
d
really
reminiscent
of
a
flanders
and
the
alcohol
is
masked
perfectly
a
really
refreshing
brew
though
youd
likely
only
want
to
share
one
of
these
due
to
the
acidity
d
very
drinkable
the
8
5
is
a
tad
high
but
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
two
bottles
in
a
sitting
this
brew
does
not
get
boring
and
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
not
sure
if
i
would
classify
it
as
a
unblended
lambic
but
what
do
i
know
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
batch
49
brewed
10
10
06
and
served
in
a
tulip
this
beer
poured
a
dark
mahogany
hue
with
a
twofinger
thick
head
of
tan
foam
that
lingered
for
a
bit
some
slippery
lacing
was
left
behind
the
aroma
of
the
beer
included
cherry
pits
wet
oak
fermented
fruits
cider
vinegar
and
also
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
flavor
consisted
of
caramel
rasins
sour
cherries
and
oak
while
moderately
sweet
there
is
a
nice
sourness
that
helps
even
things
out
slightly
puckering
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
had
light
carbonation
this
is
some
fantastic
stuff
its
funny
id
forgotten
this
was
aged
in
rhubarb
wine
casks
the
first
thing
that
popped
to
my
mind
was
a
rhubarb
tart
moderately
acetic
with
plenty
of
fruit
some
red
wine
a
little
bit
of
sherry
and
a
rather
rotten
meatlike
character
ive
found
in
some
flemish
reds
i
dont
typically
care
for
this
character
but
in
this
minimal
amount
it
is
compelling
and
enjoyable
the
palate
is
a
lot
sourer
than
id
like
with
a
clean
red
wine
vinegar
character
almost
enough
to
clean
the
sinuses
the
problem
with
some
of
these
overly
acetic
beers
is
that
a
little
bit
of
oxidation
makes
them
feel
flabby
on
the
palate
as
well
as
a
little
soapy
sherry
and
rhubarb
are
noticeable
especially
on
the
midpalate
drying
acetic
on
the
finish
with
some
strong
lactic
character
as
well
this
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
too
acetic
for
my
palate
i
wish
id
drunk
this
a
while
back

drinkability
is
pretty
high
its
tasty
and
goes
down
easily
still
its
on
the
sour
stronger
side
and
not
something
i
can
have
probably
more
then
a
second
bottle
of
in
one
sitting
still
im
glad
i
still
have
another
and
wish
more
were
available
even
though
its
not
the
best
priced
oud

out
there
note
to
self
take
emerge077s
advice
and
buy
more
than
1
bottle
next
time
he
recommends
it
you
cant
tell
the

this
is
a
high

add

one
of
my
all

favorite
beers
i
look
forward
to
the
seasonal
release
pours
a
murky
reddishbrown
with
a
foamy

that
settles
to
wisps

of
the

small
dots

form

down
smell

cherry
and
funk
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slightly
sour
malt
and
cherry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
solid
but
fairly
mild
for
a
sour
bright
and
easy
fruit
more
than
wood
a
skilled
take
on
a
difficult
style

seems
to

pretty

nice

overall
this
is
a
superbly
drinkable
beer
it
is
high
on
alcohol
for
the
style
but
still
maintains
drinkability
although
i
did
not
have
it
young
i
imagine
one
would
find
it
to
have
aged
well
there
is
very
little
to
complain
about
with
this
brew
o
glad
that
i
picked
this
up
definitely
gets
better
as
it
warms
a
tasty
oud
bruin
would
love
to
try
the
cerise

overall
awesome
brew
maybe
the
best
i
have
had
of
2012
this
brew
is
perfectly

a
nice
cherry
profile
reminiscent
of
la
folie
with
the
acetic
acid
qualities
not
overly
puckering
but
nice
sour
and
fruit
were
definitely
the
highlights
here
a
very
nice
sour
beer
that
would
probably
benefit
from
a
little
more
time
in
the
cellar
starting
to
hit
its
stride
and
very
enjoyable
overall
a
decent
beer
with
a
lot
of
good
flavors
easy
drinking
a
medium
level
of
complexity
o
a
nicely
done
sour
ive
wanted
to
try
this
and
the
cherry
version
and
was
pleased
that
they
were
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
overall
a
touch
too
acetic
but
good
nonetheless
le
serpent
came
to
me
looking
bronzish
tanned
brown
with
some
orange
highlights
a
bit
of
white
foam
on
top
not
much
stick
smell
is
of
a
bugged
up
beer
lacto
springs
out
along
with
some
funk
and
berry
scents
a
bit
of
lighter
citrus
and
wild
yeast
strains
alot
of
them
holy
moly
this
is
sour
le
serpent
has
yeast
lactobrett
with
cherry
white
grape
some
vanilla
from
the
wood
and
its
sour
bracingly
so
there
is
alot
going
on
hard
to
nail
it
down
feel
is
light
but
pretty
spritzy
and
effervescent
kinda
ruff
bitey
and
puckering
even
with
the
rough
feel
of
this
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
more
of
it
i
believe
this
was
the
regular
noncerise
version
poured
rust
orange
with
a
medium
head
vibrant
nose
of
berries
orange
skin
lime
just
a
lot
of
pleasant
citrus
in
the
nose
really
bright
flavor
with
great
citrus
especially
lime
citric
acidity
sharp
bright
fruity
sour
in
a
way
reminds
me
of
some
russian
river
stuff
with
the
light
champagne
like
body
and
refined
citrus
acidity
t20
even
good
stuff
this
one
gets
a
low
but
virtually
irrelevant
drinkability
score
due
to
the
funky
sour
earthy
and
dry
character
of
the
style
they
really
took
the
souring
agents
brett
and
cherry
to
the
max
this
took
the
gold
in
sours
at
the
gabf
and
deserves
it
really
pushes
the
envelope
on
what
sour
beer
really
means
i
drank
this
beer
while
it
was
on
tap
and
it
was
exceptional
it
had
a
much
more
attractive
tan
head
at
the
time
so
i
thought
it
fair
to
judge
the
appearance
based
on
that
although
i
just
drank
the
bottle
that
ive
had
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
and
the
appearance
had
decreased
the
le
serpent
has
turned
into
an
aromatic
and
flavorful
powerhouse
the
first
sip
was
like
a
giant
pissed
off
cherry
punched
me
square
in
the
chops
it
definitely
brings
the
funk
on
the
nasty
dunk
d
a
solid
cherry
sour
brown
that
i
enjoyed
a
fair
bit
wellcrafted
with
a
solid
integration
of
flavors
id
happily
drink
this
again
although
i
probably
wouldnt
actively
try
to
trade
for
it
considering
the
rarity
factor
this
beer
pours
a
light
to
medium
bodied
cherry
polished
wood
in
color
with
slight
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
features
a
really
nice
amount
of
tart
cherries
to
pair
with
dark
malt
and
a
nice
acidic
tartness
the
nose
is
great
for
the
style
pungent
the
flavors
are
off
dry
and
well
balanced
you
get
slightly
sweet
cherry
tart
cherry
sweet
brown
malts
and
and
an
acetic
acidity
the
vinegar
however
is
tame
just
the
way
that
i
would
prefer
it
has
a
nice
bite
too
from
the
carbonation
more
than
anything
this
drinks
very
very
well
it
is
more
complex
than
you
would
imagine
and
the
cherry
really
does
separate
itself
from
the
the
base
sour
brown
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
a
standout
for
the
style
overall
glad
to
finally
try
this
the
fruit
is
very
nice
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
regular
version
drink
simply
put
vince
you
ruled
for
bringing
this
bottle
i
would
like
another
bottle
however
dont
know
if
it
would
work
out
in
the
trade
game
great
beer
though
overall
this
was
tasty
beer
really
drinkable
better
than
the
regular
version
i
liked
the
cherries
and
the
tartness
cheers
snake
river
youve
done
yourself
proud
overall
this
was
a
fun
beer
to
try
and
im
glad
frank
made
me
take
a
pour
o
this
was
good
but
i
liked
the
regular
one
better
it
was
a
lot
more
complex
and
more
pleasant
to
drink
overall
a
crisp
easy
to
drink
oud
bruin
sourness
is
mild
enough
that
this
could
be
a
good
introduction
to
someone
new
to
sour
styles
not
cheap
but
for
good
reason
prost
tart
vinegarlike
aroma
with
an
odd
funk
bordering
on
partially
digested
dark
fruits
berry
ciderlike
sour
flavor
well
balanced
with
a
mild
dark
fruit
sweetness
hint
of
oak
and
cocoa
dry
feel
sticky
on
the
lips
near
perfection
all
around
overall
not
to
my
tastes
at
all
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
as
i
generally
like
dark
beers
and
i
generally
like
sours
that
being
said
i
do
not
like
funk
this
was
very
too
funky
for
me
in
fact
i
did
not
even
finish
the
bottle
and
tossed
it
other
reviews
have
been
much
more
positive
so
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
maybe
this
is
just
not
a
style
of
beer
for
me
the
taste
has
a
nice
sour
tartness
cherry
pit
nutty
brown
malt
slight
saltiness
possibly
from
a
sodium
bicarbonate
water
treatment
faint
bitterness
lemon
rind
and
must
perhaps
more
aggressively
acetic
than
some
this
hits
the
style
nail
on
head
but
with
authority
it
has
ample
malts
and
finishes
with
sweetness
that
loses
its
battle
to
the
tart
mid
palate
and
hereafter
medium
bodied
ale
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
flanders
style
brown
made
in
switzerland
color
me
impressed
guys
keep
up
the
good
work
an
elite
oud
bruin
a
bit
more
sour
than
some
of
the
others
on
the
market
this
has
a
lot
of
flare
though
the
bottle
is
over
20
bucks
and
unlike
the
framboise
i
think
this
one
is
a
lot
closer
to
worth
what
it
costs
dark
dark
brown
and
rather
clear
until
the
dregs
run
down
not
much
head
but
a
shiny
and
radiant
luster
to
this
the
nose
is
insanely
sour
lots
of
caustic
acidic
citric
acid
and
lemon
flavors
while
grain
tannins
are
robust
as
well
some
roast
but
not
totally
coca
forward
or
bitter
unique
brown
grain
bill
that
has
some
sugar
before
it
stars
getting
weird
the
taste
starts
with
the
richer
malt
but
moves
rapidly
into
a
classic
oud
bruin
sourness
more
than
just
lambic
sour
this
is
unique
and
brutally
intense
especially
when
it
warms
up
lemon
sourness
on
a
brown
beer
is
unique
and
lovely
somehow
delicate
for
being
huge
and
there
is
a
long
lasting
dry
burn
on
the
tongue
which
you
dont
always
get
with
these
i
love
the
fuller
body
the
depth
of
flavor
and
the
acid
intensity
but
its
a
tough
bottle
by
your
lonesome
it
works
a
lot
better
as
a
share
since
a
ton
of
this
will
definitely
turn
the
stomach
all
kinds
of
inside
out
enough
carbonation
to
be
lively
very
cool
yeast
profile
dry
as
they
get
for
the
style
top
quality
oud
bruin
worth
paying
for
if
this
is
your
style
a
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
0a0as
very
light
aromas
mainly
of
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
sour
0a0at
lots
of
dark
roasted
malts
that
are
overpowered
immediately
by
great
oaky
sourness
almost
more
of
a
sour
stout
0a0am
nicely
effervescent
with
the
sour
notes
touching
the
tip
of
my
tongue
and
my
cheeks
ending
in
a
dry
acidity
0a0ao
this
is
what
i
would
expect
if
you
mixed
the
bruery
tart
of
darkness
and
jolly
pumpkin
madrugada
obscura
together
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
0a0a
a
really
wonderful
beer
of
the
style
flavors
of
tart
cherry
and
caramel
brown
slightly
sweet
and
nicely
tart
and
puckering
its
not
over
acidic
at
all
this
is
fantastic
trois
dame
really
makes
some
amazing
brews
sours
in
particular
and
this
does
not
dissapoint
compared
to
a
duchesse
theres
no
vinegar
or
sweet
fruit
type
flavors
compared
to
many
cantillion
or
crooked
stave
theres
no
barnyard
or
horseblanket
this
is
very
mouth
puckering
sour
with
tart
possibly
unripe
fruit
flavors
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
satisfying
so
much
so
that
i
had
more
than
one
it
was
quite
appetizing
and
not
at
all
too
strong
to
enjoy
several
im
not
too
experienced
with
sours
but
compared
to
some
others
this
pleased
my
palate
in
that
it
lacked
the
stronger
vinegarlike
bite
while
still
having
a
nice
fruit
tartness
that
was
in
balance
with
the
malt
notes
o
i
found
this
to
be
quite
enjoyable
it
had
a
good
sour
smack
to
it
along
with
the
typical
oud
bruin
flavors
i
enjoy
and
the
apricot
added
another
level
of
complexity
i
could
easily
have
had
more
grande
dame
is
a
much
more
sour
beer
than
nearly
all
of
the
oude
bruins
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
try
but
its
the
unadulterated
vinegar
overtones
that
provide
all
of
the
sourness
and
could
use
more
complexity
from
earth
and
age
or
it
could
exhibit
a
more
restrained
sour
balance
for
noticeable
improvement

slight

this
beer
has
a
lower
level

a
slightly
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
in
my
opinion
o
really
quite
good
bruine
super
drinkable
similar
to
red
poppy
o
quite
good
will
buy
again
reminiscent
of
a
couple
of
cherry
barrelaged
beers
like
red
poppy
ale
which
also
have
a
lot
of
the
oak
and
gingerbread
flavors
going
for
them
o
overall
it
is
a
really
nice
very
tasty
beer
it
is
a
super
drinkable

wonderfully
balanced

big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
doppelganger
for
sharing
this
one
with
me
served
from

mikkeller

reddish
brown
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head

subsided
to
half
a

maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
vinegar
wood
tart
raspberries
and
subtle
tart
cherries
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
vinegar
tart
cherries
wood
sugar
and
subtle
raspberries
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
it
was
quite
complex
and
enjoyable
i
was
really
surprised
that
i
was
able
to
pick
up
on
raspberries
in
this
one
but
it
was
definitely
very
welcome
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
topnotch
for
this
style
a
definite
must
try
for
any
fan
of
the
style
or
anyone
curious
without
a
doubt
the
beer
is
dark
chestnut
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
the
beige
head
is
thin
and
fades
almost
immediately
the
aroma
offers
oak

flavor
brings
a
blend
of
sweet
and
tart
cherries

a
good

overall
first
flanders
oud
bruin
that
ive
had
and
ive
got
to
admit
that
i
dig
it
its
the
best
of
a
sour
and
brown
ale
im
sold
overall
impression
what
an
oud
bruin
i
had
to
pass
this
one
around
the
bar
to
let
others
experience
this
brew
would
throw
this
on
my
top
5
oud
bruin
hall
of
fame
list
without
a
doubt
love
to
see
if
others
note
this
sweetsour
battle
all
the
way
through
the
drink
like
nothing
ive
had
before
o
great
beer
i
recommend
aging
this
one
an
enjoyable
beer
if
only
for
the
fact
that
i
like
the
style
considering
the
rather
hefty
price
tag
however
i
would
not
actively
seek
this
one
out
again
there
are
much
better
options
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
flanders
oud
bruin
different
than
what
i
expected
but
still
good
i
expected
something
more
like
duchesse
de
borgogne
or
monks
cafe
a
flemish
sour
ale
with
hints
of
sweetness
but
this
has
hardly
any
hints
of
sweetness
at
first
i
thought
it
was
almost
too
tart
but
now
i
think
it
is
well
balanced
enough
that
i
would
buy
it
again
no
apparent
head
when
i
poured
it
which
is
kind
of
disappointing
little
carbonation
the
picture
on
the
bottle
is
totally
different
yet
i
assume
it
is
still
the
same
beer
pictured
d
i
liked
the
nose
quite
a
bit
but
the
flavor
was
definitely
a
let
down
good
but
not
worth
the
rather
hefty
price
tag
d
easy
to
finish
and
i
find
myself
liking
this
beer
more
and
more
it
definitely
exceeded
expectations
a
great
balance
of
sour
and
sweet
check
this
one
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
d
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
flanders
lots
of
oak
and
sour
fruits
in
the
nose
and
taste
would
like
to
have
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
tart
dark
fruit
the
flavor
is
tart
dark
fruit
oak
and
vanilla
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
sour
beer
not
as
complex
as
some
but
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
d
beyond
the
norm
could
drink
massive
amounts
of
this
dry
and
easy
to
drink
in
large
amounts
at
7
2
these
are
easy
to
crush
an
interesting
version
of
an
oud
bruin
by
a
swiss
brewer
i
am
finding
this
pretty
enjoyable
and
the
abv
is
sessionable
d
drinkability
is
somewhat
limited
overall
by
the
ph
of
this
beer
but
for
the
style
i
think
its
still
above
average
pours
cloudy
but
settles
to
the
color
of
dark
stained
wood
the
thin
beige
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
minimal
soapy
lacing
light
aromas
of
oak
and
cherries
with
a
strong
whiff
of
sticky
sweet
balsamic
vinegar
reduction
smells
fresher
than
your
average
oud
bruin
with
the
brightness
of
fresh
grapes
the
yeastiness
coming
through
is
funkier
than
expected
reminiscent
of
a
saison
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
a
bit
dry
sweet
notes
of
caramel
and
roasted
almonds
play
nicely
against
mild
flavors
of
tart
fruit
the
finish
has
a
lingering
balsamic
vinegar
sharpness
bottle
poured

dark
redddish
color
ale
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
vinous
sour
notes
is
well
done
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
tart
notes
with
some
oak
and
light
cherry
backed
by
a
nice
solid
malt
backbone
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
very
well
done
and
definitely
underrated
compared
to
some
other
beer
form
this
style
surprised
this
is
rated
as
low
as
it
is
thought
there
was
a
lot
of
hype
about
it
anyways
the
beer
is
darn
good
yet
not
adding
much
to
the
genre
despite
the
addition
of
toasted
almonds
to
the
brew
which
i
wanted
to
taste
a
lot
more
than
i
do
while
there
is
a
distinct
nuttiness
amongst
all
the
lactic
sour
intensity
and
acidic
chocolate
malt
that
earthy
vanilla
milky
complex
never
arrives
not
much
head
or
real
carbonation
to
this
it
could
use
about
25
more
of
these
than
it
has
but
other
than
that
the
beer
is
great
nice
acidity
some
simplicity
too
for
trinity
who
is
known
for
bizarre
recipes
clay
aging
and
the
like
this
is
a
bit
more
straight
forward
very
much
in
the
oud
bruin
style
with
all
the
sourness
coming
on
the
tail
end
mild
malt
body
almonds
flash
in
for
just
a
second
mid
palate
when
i
search
for
them
but
a
higher
dose
of
that
would
set
this
beer
apart
jesus
christ
i
dont
know
if
a
fresher
version
would
have
been
better
the
label
states
it
can
be
cellared
indefinitely
but
unless
extremely
intense
vinegar
and
sourness
is
your
thing
this
beer
has
very
little
going
for
it
it
certainly
hasnt
aged
well
this
is
a
tongue
ripper
with
an
abysmal
feel
to
it
the
aroma
is
the
best
thing
and
almost
seems
promising
for
a
wild
ale
but
the
taste
just
slams
you
with
a
mouth
cringing
twang
is
this
beer
over
done
yes
is
it
amazingly
delicious
yes
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
any
true
sour
lover
trinity
nailed
this
blend
eventhough
i
prefer
batch
1
more
overall
this
is
a
good
to
decent
beer
definitely
lacks
in
elegance
but
it
does
the
job
if
you
like
sour
beers
overall
let
down
big
time
ive
had
typically
pretty
good
luck
with
cellared
beers
but
im
beginning
to
think
my
luck
may
have
changed
a
wee
bit
i
dont
think
im
going
to
be
able
to
finish
this
and
im
disappointed
because
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
challenging
beer
at
least
the
bottle
has
a
cool
label
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
fades
to
nothing
no
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
fruity
and
slight
vinegar
aromas
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
super
acidic
and
puckering
finish
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
sour
with
some
great
aromas
and
flavors

the

in

though
not
much
of

nor

the
only
thing
about
this
beer
that
isnt
welcoming
or
impressive
the
nose
is
a
pleasant
blend
of
tart
fruit
character
sweet
malt
oak
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
the
former
being
most
prevalent
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
pronounced
tart
sour
character
that
dominates
the
flavor
throughout
first
flavor
you
encounter
and
lasts
until
its
the
last
thing
you
taste
the
oak
and
vanilla
and
malty
sweetness
are
much
less
prevalent
than
in
the
nose
but
the
fruity
character
is
a
bit
more
bold
finishes
crisp
and
actually
quite
smooth
medium
bodied
but
nut
much
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
am
told
each
bottle
tastes
a
little
different
so
i
will
be
heading
back
to
pick
more
up
its
a
bit
pricey
at
around
25bottle
but
i
would
cellar
a
few
and
save
for
a
nice
occasion
its
interesting
to
see
peoples
reaction
to
the
beer
i
didnt
pick
up
any
of
the
unpleasant
characteristics
others
commented
on
perhaps
its
this
bottle
or
batch
i
would
recommend
for
sure
overall
quite
sour
if
you
want
a
kick
in
the
nuts
then
this
beer
will
deliver
unfortunately
i
want

poor

love

aroma
of
tart

acetic
acid
and
boozesoaked
wood
taste
of
tart
and
sour
cherries
but
not
too
lippuckering
after
reading
other
reviews
i
have
to
wonder
how
long
this
bottle
sat
in
the
cellar
and
if
it
indeed
mellowed
out
a
bit
with
time
more
acetic
acid
vinegar
chewy
bread
and
hints
of
citrus
oak
and
wet

mediumbodied
quite
acidic
but
still
pretty
tame
compared
to
other
members
of
the
style
not
to
mention
pretty
low
in
alcohol
i
liked
this
one
its
no
rr
supplication
but
its
still
pretty
good
pours
a
cherrywood
brown
with
no
visible
head
slight
carbonation
aroma
of
lacto
cherries
sour
grapes
and
slight
vinegar
taste
follows
nose
sweet
and
tart
cherries
up
front
with
vinegar
in
the
back
the
sour
sticks
around
and
puckers
well
after
the
last
sip
i
love
this
beer
my
only
knock
is
i
would
like
a
little
more
carbonation
i
like
this
beer
even
if
its
a
bit
too
still
the
flavor
is
something
i
never
tire
of
and
i
really
do
hope
i
can
get
more
of
it
in
the
future
overall
a
few
ounces
was
too
much
taste
with
a
thimble
beer
has
a
subtle
light
sweetness
on
the
front
end
thins
out
immediately
into
a
mixture
of
solvent
flavors
strong
acetic
tartness
at
the
back
corners
definitely
vinegar
and
acetone
in
this
one
it
is
hard
to
drink
and
burns
so
good
it
wasnt
bad
it
was
like
a
consecration
on
crack
in
the
middle
of
holding
up
a
small
grocery
store
because
the
trashy
girlfriend
he
started
hanging
out
with
once
he
started
on
his
bender
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
and
consecration
on
crack
will
do
anything
for
that
bitch
i
might
have
it
again
o
poured
myself
about
5
ounces
of
this
and
it
was
about
3
ounces
too
much
this
one
is
crazy
tart
and
is
like
drinking
vinegar
not
something
id
seek
out
again
i
have
to
admit
that
the
bottom
half
of
the
bottle
got
tough
to
drink
the
sourness
is
manageable
at
first
but
seems
to
accumulate
rather
than
dissipate
even
sipping
slowly
this
gets
overwhelming
it
needs
a
companion
like
a
good
creamy
cheese
my
palate
never
seemed
to
adjust
the
price
tag
is
pretty
crazy
as
well
not
something
id
normally
be
able
to
afford
i
remember
when
a
12
bottle
was
outrageous
o
definitely
one
of
the
most
sour
beers
if
not
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
pretty
one
dimensional
but
i
really
am
enjoying
getting
my
sour
fix
interesting
beer
and
one
that
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
it

one
of
the
most

beers
i
have
had
in

long
time
i
mean
this
things
will
make
you
cough
if
you
inhale
through
the

to
deeply
when
taking

out

this
is
the
most

i
have
ever
had
bar
none
it
burns
the
taste
buds
off
your
tongue
feels
like
acid
going
down

throat
and
dumps
acid
into
your
stomach
for
some
reason
i
love
it
i
drank
the
dregs
of
the
bottle
and
they
were
delicious
at
the
same
time
i
understand
why
this
is
such
a
polarizing
beer
and
most
people
do
not
like
it
i
could
barely
finish
2
oz
of
this
beast
i
was
warned
about
this
one
but
unfortunately
thats
also
part
of
the
reason
i
wanted
it
really
disappointed
with
this
beer
considering
trinitys
consistently
outstanding
other
offerings
i
understand
the
experimental
adventure
typical
of
wild
ales
but
i
have
to
say
brewing
novelty
beer
that
tastes
this
bad
isnt
really
an
achievement
when
thousands
of
years
of
experimentation
have
brought
us
to
brewers
yeast
as
a
means
to
an
end
if
wild
yeast
was
the
best
form
for
brewing
beatification
batch
ii
and
acidic

been
wanting

beer
is
a
light
brown
color
and
appears
pretty
clear
there
is
virtually
no
head
or
lace
i
think
the
sour
monster
scared
them
away
possibly
the
sourest
beer
i
have
ever
had
which
hurts
the
appearance
but
lets
the
acidic
notes
sting
the
throat
in
its
place
nice
to
have
a
small
glass
of
this
and
see
what
complexities
i
can
pick
up
in
something
so
intense
sour
as
all
hell
tart
taste
is
vinegar
there
is
a
basic
malt
flavor
that
lingers
after
the
vinegar
sourness
has
passed
deceptively
simple
a
very
clean
sour
that
kept
me

excellent
living

being
a
fan
of
sours
trying
this
one
was
long
overdue
and
much
enjoyed
the
tartness
mixed
with
the
ale
flavor
was
just
right
the
taste
evolved

its
definitely
world
class
going
to
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
if
this
came
in
12
ounce
bottles
i
would
probably
buy
more
and
its
got
a
really
good
price
point
for
the
quality
you
like

this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try

is
medium

that
gives
a

impression
the
best
example
from
america
and
rivals
the
belgian
version
but
may
lack
their
depth
o
im
getting
fonder
of
sours
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
very
well
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
beer
while
it
may
be
way
too
sweet
or
way
too
sour
for
many
for
sour
beer
lovers
this
is
definitely
one
to
try
not
super
sour
but
just
the
right
amount
very
smooth
o
one
of
the
better

out
there
damn
good
definitely
going
to
look
for
this

the

ive
had

heard
many
great
things
about
this

this
sour
is

they
lean

being
to
much
on

the

experience
is

to
eating

as

so
sour
it
makes
you
cringe
yet
you
still
have
another
like
warheads
there
is
a
bit
of
subtle
sweetness
that
enhances
the
complexity
and
gives
you
a
brief
lapse
in
the
sour
this
is
a
great
beer

the

made

wonder

long

i
have
heard
the

really
are
not
meant
to
be
cellared
i
really
enjoyed
subsequent
tastings
of
the
2010
batch
it
remains
enticing
and
flavorful
from
start
to
finish
the
lemon
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
maybe
after
a
glass
and
a
half
sour
but
maybe
a
few
years
on
the
bottle
will
fix
that
worth
picking
up
if
you
havent
tried
it

had
really

of

this
is

a

the

at

quite

find
out
the

sticky

the

the

suggests

it
drinks
insanely
easy
considering

love
the
authentic
nature
of

i
love
the
intense

what
this

it
certainly
makes
up

it

the

are

you
dont

anymore
than
the

that
is
something
that
could

im

like
that
so

be

it

took
me

bite

a
pretty

a

one
to
have
tried
overall
cherry
is
a
bitch
in
a
beer
i
am
fussy
when
it
comes
to
the
flavor
and
this
beer
like
mr

walks

and
not
the
worst
overall
pretty
good
but
the
cherry
flavor
is
straddles
the
medicinal
line
way
out
of
style
obviously
and
very
sweet
but
worth
a
try
o
overall
a
very
nice
flanders
not
super
sour
but
very
tasty
and
definitely
did
not
feel
like
12
abv
would
like
to
have
it
again
o
not
overly
complex
but
it
does
cherry
very
well
with
a
nice
balance
between
sweet
sour
very
drinkable
would
never
guess
that
is
has
12
abv
also
had
this
fresh
on
tap
and
thought
it
was
a
bit
sweeter
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
offering
from
kunhenns
the
drinkability
is
insane
for
the
alcohol
i
feel
like
im
drinking
a
6
beer
id
love
to
have
a
couple
of
these
but
its
a
little
pricey
for
what
it
is
its
a
pretty
good
value
though
o
too
bad
there
werent
some
more
bubbles
in
this
one
flavors
were
rich
but
nothing
too
special
the
cherry
flavors
were
authentic
tasting
though
and
not
syrupy
i
was
expecting
more
oak
more
tartness
more
bubbles
not
a
bad
beer
and
it
was
fun
to
sip
on
but
i
dont
need
to
have
this
again
o
very
good
beer
the
bottled
versio
is
much
more
sour
than
the
tap
version
the
tap
version
tastes
a
lot
more
like
cherry
cough
syrup
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
second
night
of
the
winter
solstice
a
nice
drinkable
beer
in
the
style
but
a
little
on
the
sweeter
side
than
the
best
examples
of
the
style
reddish
lacy
good
cherry
very
malted
ameliorating
the
potential
sourness
i
would
expect
and
like
worth
a
try
o
knocking
the
sweetness
down
would
elevate
this
for
me
but
still
quite
enjoyable
o
overall
a
rather
interesting
beer
the
booze
is
strong
in
this
one
but
the
flavoring
is
nice
o
its
pretty
good
but
not
great
overall
this
definitely
falls
on
the
sweet
side
of
the
spectrum
when
it
comes
to
oud
bruins
and
it
is
higher
than
the
normal
alcohol
range
as
well
the
complexity
was
there
but
i
think
i
would
have
preferred
it
to
have
been
toned
down
just
a
bit
in
the
alcohol
and
sweetness
department
to
let
some
of
the
other
flavors
shine
through
a
little
bit
o
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
beer
very
sweet
with
little
malt
backbone
i
was
not
sure
how
to
review
this
o
again
a
little
of
this
goes
a
very
long
way
one
glass
was
sufficient
for
my
party
of
5
to
all
try
some
and
be
good
i
liked
it
but
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
sour
and
a
bit
less
syrup
seriously
though
huuuge
kudos
on
masking
the
alcohol
this
drank
like
5
crazy
o
huge
flavors
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
some
sourness
but
not
enough
intense
o
overall
very
impressed
another
successful
venture
into
sours
for
kuhnhenn
o
overall
really
not
enjoying
this
one
too
much
its
tough
to
put
back
but
glad
i
got
to
try
it
non
the
less
the
marrón
acidifié
i
also
got
in
this
trade
was
a
hell
of
lot
better
than
this
one

a
huge
thanks
to
schmittymack
for
generously
sharing
this
one
with
us
last
friday
night
poured
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
tan
foam
on
top
aromas
of
sour
cherries
tobacco
and
caramel
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
bodied
and
tart
with
huge
cherry
flavors
along
with
light
vinegar
and
caramel
overall
this
is
a
bigtime
sipper
because
of
the
high
alcohol
and
heavy
sourness
but
the
flavor
doesnt
do
enough
for
me
to
handle
sipping
on
this
for
the
hour
plus
that
it
necessitates
sadly
i
dont
think
i
will
be
finishing
the
bottle
d
a
great
oud
bruin
to
say
the
least
oaky
fruity
and
sour
with
a
great
balance
and
drinkability
a
great
example
for
the
style
even
though
it
carries
a
hefty
abv
level
for
the
style
o
this
beer
is
what
i
imagine
quelque
chose
would
be
like
if
it
had
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
my
hope
for
a
good
east
coastmidwest
sour
ale
im
hoping
there
are
better
sours
out
in
that
direction
i
feel
spoiled
with
rr
la
and
cascade
sours
at
my
constant
disposal
but
they
are
excellent
for
comparison
this
one
should
be
classified
as
a
fruit
beer
because
it
is
plainly
sweet
without
a
sour
or
tart
quality
glad
to
try
it
but
disappointed
pours
a
nice
rusty
mahogany
with
a
silky
tan
head
nose
has
tart
cherries
ripe
pitted
fruits
sweet
malts
and
acidic
grapes
taste
is
also
full
of
fresh
vibrant
cherries
dry
acidic
finish
crisp
refreshing
body
another
great
beer
from
kuhnhenn
and
my
first
sour
from
them
overall
this
is
one
i
could
skip
the
next
time
around
it
isnt
terrible
but
is
doesnt
wow
me
in
any
aspect
i
am
sorely
disappointed
in
this
beet
d
this
was
an
amazing
beer
that
didnt
look
or
smell
like
it
tasted
d
this
is
about
the
most
drinkable
11
5
abv
beer
ive
ever
tasted
i
would
keep
a
case
of
this
in
the
cellar
if
i
could
slick
on
the
palate
but
light
enough
in
texture
from
the
low
residual
sugars
this
is
pretty
much
spot
on
in
my
eyes
while
it
could
use
more
carbonation
the
lack
thereof
does
not
really
detract
from
the
feel
though
i
do
wonder
if
there
wouldnt
be
a
bit
more
complexity
with
some
carbonation
to
open
it
up
a
little
extremely
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
this
could
be
dangerous
as
it
doesnt
show
a
hint
of
the
booze
drinkability
insanely
drinkable
i
get
just
an
ever
so
slight
warming
of
the
throat
from
this
beer
and
this
is
the
2010
version
i
cant
even
imagine
how
drinkable
this
will
be
in
a
year
or
two
i
am
most
definitely
going
to
iso
this
beer
asap
d
11
5
are
you
kidding
me
this
is
by
far
the
most
dangerous
beer
ive
ever
had
it
drinks
like
its
4
no
problem
you
could
get
someone
absolutely
wrecked
off
this
beer
its
not
too
sour
at
all
this
one
has
a
scary
drinkability
level
thanks
to
beefwolf77
for
sharing
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
because
of
the
low
carbonation
but
it
never
becomes
sticky
or
reminiscent
of
cough
syrup
thats
saying
a
lot
since
this
is
such
a
cherrydriven
beer
the
drinkability
is
nice
especially
since
this
is
such
a
big
beer
very
well
done
im
looking
out
for
more
next
spring
in
mi
d
im
glad
this
is
in
a
12oz
serving
because
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
much
more
its
certainly
a
solid
beer
and
provides
some
nice
cherry
notes
but
its
pretty
thick
and
the
finish
leaves
a
flavor
that
i
still
cant
decide
if
i
like
or
not
i
might
pick
more
of
this
up
if
i
had
the
chance
so
i
could
see
how
it
ages
drinkability
is
average
there
is
sour
cherry
in
this
beer
so
kuhnhenn
does
deliver
that
but
in
a
very
one
dimensional
way
the
high
abv
is
somewhat
noticeable
and
the
thickness
for
this
style
also
cuts
down
on
drinkability
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
with
beers
like
rosso
e
marrone
in
this
category
this
one
doesnt
come
close
overall
im
not
disappointed
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
this
was
not
a
pleasantness
dark
brown
with
a
dense
tan
head
retention
is
great
nose
has
vanilla
brown
sugar
and
plenty
of
it
like
an
oud
bruin
on
steroids
i
also
get
some
burnt
sugar
toffee
grapes
and
port
palate
opens
sweet
and
winelike
almost
dessert
wine
like
with
brown
sugar
vanilla
light
acetic
tartness
but
mostly
overwhelming
sweetness
long
fruity
finish
with
berries
this
is
full
in
body
with
light
carbonation
almost
exquisite
in
this
aspect
solid
stuff
i
think
the
sweetness
is
a
little
much
here
to
allow
you
to
enjoy
an
entire
bottle
overall
a
very
interesting
and
complex
take
on
the
style
as
i
said
though
i
found
this
to
be
rather
sweet
and
lacking
the
tartness
that
i
generally
find
in
this
style
as
usual
kuhnhenn
really
makes
some
great
beer
when
there
isnt
a
quality
control
issue
this
is
a
hefty
sweet
oud
bruin
with
just
enough
tartness
to
keep
things
interesting
although
itd
not
applicable
here
ive
reviewed
several
beers
which
id
categorize
differently
than
the
person
who
first
reviewed
it
i
bet
you
have
too
dhard
enough
to
choke
down
one
perhaps
better
suited
for
a
smaller
serving
d
low
theres
a
few
flavors
that
draw
me
out
of
what
has
the
potential
to
be
a
stellar
beer
needs
some
serious
tweaking
each
sip
i
would
tell
myself
its
not
that
bad
and
then
the
stale
flavors
would
hit
me
for
a
second
and
then
theyd
be
gone
a
befuddling
beer
overall
found
this
to
be
a
very
unique
brew
but
also
tasty
which
high
rating
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
and
no
carbonation
take
away
from
my
overrall
rating
but
still
enjoyable
imho
d
very
high
drinkability
considering
the
abv
it
gets
tastier
as
you
go
too
a
very
nice
and
tasty
brew
this
was
almost
still
the
smell
was
like
black
cherry
jam
and
booze
the
flavor
was
a
little
more
complex
it
had
sour
cheeries
that
ended
with
a
boozy
cherry
pit
flavor
alcohol
is
strong
and
this
beer
is
syrupy
and
coats
your
tongue
i
almost
didnt
want
this
to
be
sour
but
once
my
palate
adjusted
it
felt
better
d
a
decent
beer
that
gets
much
much
better
as
the
carbonation
leaves
and
it
warms
a
little
the
fruitiness
seeps
through
a
bit
more
and
this
one
actually
becomes
quite
drinkable
still
lacking
the
vinegary
kick
and
real
sourness
that
ive
come
to
enjoy
from
the
style
cask
as
the
great
taste
pours
a
rosy
red
slightly
cloudy
color
with
a
slight
tan
head
tart
sweet
cherries
just
absolutely
dominates
the
nose
with
some
sour
notes
as
well
tart
bite
on
the
tongue
followed
by
a
full
fruity
taste
of
cherries
with
both
sweet
and
tart
tastes
very
well
balanced
light
mouthfeel
this
sour
monster
is
firing
on
all
cylinders
and
i
would
happily
drink
myself
into
a
massive
hangover
with
it
j
pour
looks
so
nice
in
a
sherry
dark
red
with
of
mild
murk
nose
is
intensely
of
cherry
pie
and
the
palate
is
back
with
so
much
nice
malt
that
it
just
sits
on
your
tongue
although
i
must
say
it
is
a
bit
elixer
like
when
it
comes
to
the
feel
for
some
the
abv
and
the
intense
cherry
richness
may
come
off
as
tussin
like
but
its
more
meaty
than
that
its
has
a
nice
english
barley
wine
finish
and
hints
of
coconut
sweet
and
thyme
bitter
a
nice
one
seek
it
out
strong
sour
fans
overall
great
beer
glad
i
bought
a
couple
of
them
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
changes
over
the
years
the
body
is
thicker
than
normal
maybe
not
too
thick
but
you
can
tell
that
lots
of
fermentables
went
into
this
thus
the
12
abv
too
drinkable
for
the
abv
dangerous
stuff
the
appearance
is
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
that
has
a
pink
hue
to
it
taking
a
whiff
of
it
presents
scents
of
vinegar
cherry
alcohol
as
well
as
some
vanilla
it
tastes
very
rich
and
sweet
along
with
the
presence
of
malt
and
those
tart
cherries
not
too
sour
mouthfeel
is
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
for
this
midwestern
oud
bruin
i
am
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
look
forward
to
trying
other
beers
from
kuhnhenn
in
the
future
awesome
version
of
an
ode
bruin
the
cherry
flavor
really
comes
out
but
is
not
too
powerful
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
such
a
high
gravity
beer
so
i
could
drink
more
of
it
get
thaer
and
get
yourself
some
while
its
still
available
has
been
going
fast
hey
kuhnhenn
why
arent
you
in
philly
yet
whats
the
holdup
your
in
nyc
and
the
surrounding
areas
up
there
whats
the
holdup
what
are
you
brewers
chicken
ya
scared
get
your
beers
down
here
and
all
is
forgiven
same
goes
for
goose
island
get
your
acts
together
guys
come
on
i
know
you
want
to
d
not
a
bit
of
heat
from
this
beast
of
a
sour
sour
but
not
to
much
sweet
but
not
to
much
complex
and
enjoyable
i
wish
i
had
scooped
another
one
of
these
a
very
interesting
and
very
tart
changeofpace
beer
pretty
damn
awful
one
of
my
very
few
drain
pours
a
big
disappointment
overall
an
amazing
beer
so
many
fresh
cherries
very
drinkable
for
the
high
abv
really
glad
to
have
tried
this
on
tap
yet
another
great
tasting
beer
from
the
guys
up
at
kuhnhenn
keep
em
coming
please
it
was
nice
to
try
this
one
but
it
could
have
been
better
with
more
tart
flavors
and
less
sweet
cherry
this
beer
appears
a
light
brown
hue
with
a
tiny
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
aromas
of
cherries
and
alcohol
are
the
dominating
scents
the
beer
tastes
very
good
with
a
decent
balance
of
tartness
to
sweetness
the
cherry
flavors
which
are
very
forward
and
the
high
abv
make
this
beer
too
sweet
for
me
to
indulge
in
more
than
one
serving
perhaps
a
couple
of
years
in
the
cellar
would
enhance
the
drinkability
factor
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
and
one
i
would
have
again
d
this
brew
doesnt
seem
to
meld
right
on
the
palate
its
not
bad
somewhat
drinkablebut
it
just
doesnt
blend
right
dpretty
tasty
and
improves
as
it
warms
notes
of
metallic
phenol
in
the
back
when
it
was
first
served
but
faded
balanced
not
bad
beer
is
big
and
sweet
with
a
quick
acetic
sourness
that
follows
quickly
cherry
very
cherry
almost
candy
like
flavors
in
the
back
some
tartness
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
beer
is
thin
and
there
is
low
carbonation
on
the
palate
slight
sour
finish
with
a
slightly
dry
back
palate
pretty
good
ruddy
brown
pour
with
a
fine
offwhite
head
some
lace
spots
and
streaks
as
it
dies
to
a
film
intense
cherry
and
vinegar
aromas
alongside
a
good
amount
of
candy
sugar
very
sweet
and
intense
almost
thick
smell
mindblowingly
intense
cherry
alternating
between
sweet
and
sour
on
the
palate
with
the
sweetness
eventually
getting
the
upper
hand
and
winning
out
theres
also
an
interesting
fruit
vinegar
quality
to
this
beer
along
with
a
slight
funk
and
touch
of
caramel
slightly
boozy
its
a
thick
sticky
beast
but
one
more
than
deserving
of
some
of
your
time
extreme
for
the
style
but
recommended
drinkability
decent
but
im
not
digging
the
mouthfeel
d
not
really
sure
what
is
going
on
here
this
was
not
all
that
good
and
im
sorry
to
say
i
would
not
want
to
try
this
one
again
drinkability
kind
of
a
strange
brew
overall
but
still
enjoyed
the
shit
out
of
it
the
cherries
are
front
and
center
just
how
i
like
em
not
sure
if
this
will
sour
up
a
bit
more
with
some
age
on
it
but
im
glad
i
enjoyed
fresh
thanks
much
jeff
i
have
to
say
this
is
really
good
but
not
at
all
what
i
expected
for
the
style
its
not
really
a
tart
vinegar
like
beer
rather
its
a
sweettart
cherry
flavor
slightly
malty
booze
is
pretty
well
hidden
carbonation
mild
to
low
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
and
overall
very
drinkable
another
great
beer
from
kuhnhenn
d
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
i
would
have
never
thought
it
was
11
5
unless
i
looked
on
the
bottle
however
the
strong
tart
taste
of
cherry
flavors
makes
this
one
a
sipper
drinkablility
is
good
for
such
a
big
beer
its
hard
to
believe
this
beer
is
11
5
alcohol
d
drinks
good
but
would
only
drink
one
due
to
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
i
poured
into
my
glass
to
absolutely
no
head
it
is
brown
in
color
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
wine
it
has
a
tart
cherry
smell
and
taste
i
get
a
hint
of
vinegar
in
there
too
i
get
some
cranberry
on
the
taste
this
is
a
new
experience
for
me
and
i
like
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
although
others
who
shared
it
were
not
as
keen
on
it
the
fruit
flavor
was
nice
but
it
wasnt
sour
like
it
claimed
to
be
and
was
slightly
medicinal
this
detracted
from
the
drinkability
d
very
drinkable
not
sure
on
the
style
classification
but
another
really
impressive
beer
coming
from
kuhnhenn
poured
right
down
into
the
center
of
the
glass
from
six
inches
above
and
still
no
head
no
lacing
either
deep
muddy
brown
colored
liquid
like
youd
expect
to
find
catfish
swimming
around
the
bottom
of
the
glass
sort
of
yellows
around
the
rims
curiously
lots
of
visible
bubbles
inside
yet
no
head
sour
pie
of
wild
cherries
not
the
type
of
sweeter
cherries
you
get
in
the
store
you
even
get
the
flakes
of
hard
crust
baking
spices
and
a
light
blood
orange
infusion
before
its
gone
you
get
a
damp
kind
of
forest
floor
vegetation
that
said
its
all
about
the
cherries
very
fullbodied
dense
and
muscular
mouth
presence
the
carbonation
adds
a
tight
tickle
to
stir
the
pot
ever
so
slowly
comes
close
to
identically
replicating
the
nose
those
sour
cherries
have
a
golden
honey
dappled
flakiness
haphazard
flourishes
of
vanilla
bean
ginger
and
chamomile
here
you
get
more
white
grapefruit
than
orange
takes
the
pucker
factor
to
eleven
not
as
earthy
or
green
as
in
the
nose
most
effective
when
warmed
up
some
gains
staying
power
in
both
the
nose
and
palate
admirable
clarity
of
purpose
here
soft
and
fine
carbonation
is
very
nice
despite
the
complete
lack
of
a
head
not
exactly
a
clone
of
my
favorite
belgian
versions
of
the
style
but
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
this
only
my
second
beer
from
this
brewer
and
the
first
ive
reviewed
but
so
far
i
have
to
say
im
very
impressed
enjoyed
this
one
alone
but
probably
should
have
split
it
i
can
easily
drink
all
12oz
but
it
really
does
get
a
bit
sweet
by
the
last
few
ounces
im
sure
it
will
age
well
and
it
goes
down
as
another
great
beer
by
kuhnhenns
for
me
pours
a
clear
amber
color
15
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
herb
jellolike
aroma
and
cherries
fits
the
style
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
noticeable
tartness
and
slight
dryness
tastes
of
tart
malt
cherries
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
and
slight
herb
overall
a
good
blend
body
and
aroma
overall
decent
tasty
but
sweet
and
overpowering
not
a
bruin
but
worth
a
shot
to
split
a
bottle
with
someone
sweetish
cherry
and
balsamic
vinegar
up
front
woody
edge
some
tart
cherry
and
raspberry
in
the
background
providing
nice
contrast
to
the
sweeter
flavors
sugary
cherries
and
strawberries
slightly
medicinal
and
warming
nice
bite
of
tartness
near
the
finish
finish
dries
out
a
bit
woody
with
the
lingering
tartness
some
fruitiness
sweetness
also
sticks
around
warming
and
strong
but
drinks
more
like
89
fullbodied
with
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
not
bad
definitely
a
sipper
d
really
complex
and
tasty
definitely
a
sipper
and
totally
worth
the
money
definitely
try
to
get
a
hold
of
this
d
if
anything
the
sweetness
might
get
a
bit
tiring
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
this
would
get
you
drunk
pretty
fast
as
the
alcohol
is
very
hard
to
detect
not
really
what
i
expect
from
an
oud
bruin
but
a
very
good
fruit
beer
instead
maybe
one
of
these
days
the
kuhnhenn
brothers
will
take
the
plunge
and
make
something
more
to
style
it
needs
some
lactic
sourness
and
a
bit
more
vinegar
here
guys

good
tasty
beer
fruit

spice
on

pours
dar
brown
with
a
thin
film
of
a
cap
the
palate
is
sour
and
fruity
over
rich
malt
sweetness
the
balance
is
tilted
slightly
to
the
sweet
only
mildly
tart
with
hints
of
fruit
mostly
apples
subtle
spices
blended
in

with

neither
dry
nor
moist
nor

in

lingering
fruit
flavor
in
the
end
really
comes
off
as
a
session
like
oud
bruin
and
dumbed
down
easy
drinking
but
really
nothing
exciting
pours
a
cloudy
and
darker
honey
brown
has
hues
in
it
and
a
fat
enough
head
of
tan
foam
that
fell
slowly
enough
to
leave

is
vibrant
with
black
cherry
and
dark

some
treacle
and
a
good
little
hint
of
something
sour
taste
is
rich
and
crisp
malt
lots
of
layers
to
this
one
dark
fruits
a
touch
of
spice
and
that
treacle
this
has
a
slight
hop
bitter
that
comes
to
the
tongue
just
as
the
small
pucker
from
sour
kicks
in
and
your
mouth
starts
to
really
water
this
finishes
dry
and
with
a
big
juiciness
medium
mouthfeel
love
it
surprisingly
delicious
the
sour
taste
is
slight
but
enjoyable
not
my
style
of
beer
and
an
average
sour
in
comparison
simply
not
what
i
like
in
a
beer
its
way
to
sweet
with
a
sluggish
body
the
bottle
with
paper
wrapping
looks
very
attractive
though
its
a
damn
good
oud
bruin
accessible
for
someone
new
to
sours

i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
need
to
drink
more
sours
fantastic
job
appearance
is
between
bordeauxred
and
brown
with
a
white
head
that
rapidly
vanishes
aroma
of
red
fruits
which
also
reappears
in
the
taste
this
in
combination
with
a
medium
sour
taste
gives
the
beer
a
winey
taste
love
the
beer
love
the
style
of
beer
after
visiting
russian
river
and
loving
their
sours
i
now
find
myself
gravitating
in
that
direction
seeking
out
sours
i
am
even
more
convinced
that
rr
does
them
right
having
said
that
this
is
a
pretty
decent
sour
abiet
quite
different
but
still
darn
tasty
smoother
than
duchesse
tastes
very
good
i
actually
dont
usually
like
sours
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
it
to
be
and
didnt
completely
destroy
the
palate
malt
brings
some
sweetness
and
the
sour
taste
that
is
there
is
more
of
a
citruc
sour
and
not
a
vinegar
one
that
i
expected
pours
out
a
deep
brown
with
red
hues
smells
of
caramel
malts
with
a
very
subdued
barrelsour
nose
flavor
has
a
sour
twang
but
not
a
very
strong
vinegarbarrel
character
as
one
would
expect
from
this
style
a
bit
one
note
malt
tastes
of
general
sweet
mouthfeel
is
light
and
prickly
this
isnt
bad
but
really
lacking
in
many
ways
o
i
really
liked
this
one
the
mix
of
slight
sour
dark
fruit
and
rich
earthiness
really
worked
well
together
this
beer
had
a
lot
of
flavor
but
in
a
well
rounded
way
unlike
other
beers
that
just
try
to
be
the
most
sour
or
the
most
roasty
very
nice
polite
likable
brown
perhaps
a
nice
mild
springboard
if
you
were
introducing
someone
to
belgian
sours
for
my
own
purposes
there
are
some
better
examples
id
reach
for
over
bacchus
the
palate
is
kind
of
the
same
way
needs
a
little
zip
there
is
a
definite
sour
presence
but
it
only
goes
to
7
the
flavors
are
more
earthy
and
the
dark
sugar
dominates
the
balance
and
mouthfeel
are
right
where
they
should
be
and
its
quite
easy
to
drink
but
would
be
helped
by
some
more
complexity
of
flavors
the
key
word
seems
to
be
pleasant
where
memorable
is
unfortunately
what
the
price
commands
under
the
right
circumstances
i
could
see
knocking
a
few
back
though
overall
one
of
the
best
flemish
reds
ive
had
and
ive
been
tasting
a
number
of
them
lately
cant
wait
to
introduce
this
one
to
friends
o
the
bottle
recommends
a
temperature
of
41f
a
temperature
some
might
think
is
too
cold
for
a
specialty
beer
absolutely
sample
it
at
this
flavor
as
it
really
allows
the
tartness
of
this
beer
to
shine
it
is
funky
in
flavor
but
this
is
part
of
the
character
and
actually
quite
enjoyable
i
recently
bought
several
different
belgians
to
try
out
after
a
trip
to
brussels
this
one
is
good
quality
belgian
dark
ale
has
subtle
tastes
of
spices
with
minor
after
taste
it
works
well
with
charcuterie
and
cheeses
its
a
good
overall
beer
but
i
wish
it
had
more
flavor
but
does
not
stand
out
and
for
the
price
you
can
find
better
brews
o
lacks
character
needs
to
be
more
sour
or
at
least
have
more
fruit
flavor
heavily
oxidized
and
not
very
tasty
when
cold
but
has
good
tartness
when
warmed
up
do
not
drink
this
cold
it
transforms
from
tasting
like
a
mistake
to
a
snappy
apple
cider
vinegar
sourness
that
bites
with
sharpness
and
still
has
sweetness
to
round
it
out
glad
i
let
it
warm
up
nicely
executed
and
easy
to
drink
well
meet
again
a
beer
ive
been
meaning
to
try
on
my
last
three
or
four
visits
to
belgium
glad
i
made
the
effort
to
finally
buy
one
12
7oz
bottle
6
99
the
beer
is
a
rusty
brown
hue
initially
there
is
a
small
head
but
this
quickly
fades
to
nil
giving
a
still
appearance
the
aroma
brings
sweet
and
sour
cherry
musty
basement
vinegar
tart
fruit
cranberry
raisins
perhaps
more
sweet
than
sour
apple
juice
and
maraschino
cherries
low
carbonation
with
a
sugary
finish
this
was
just
ok
bottom
line
i
wont
be
buying
again
but
you
might
like
it
if
you
enjoy
krieks
frambois
any
sort
of
fruited
lambic
or
oud
bruin
im
not
entirely
sure
what
i
paid
but
im
sure
itd
covered
the
cost
of
a
750ml
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
or
a
4pk
of
festina
peche
rather
have
either
of
those
a
very
refreshing
and
balanced
but
lacks
depth
overall
a
decent
oud
bruin
nothing
offensive
and
nothing
too
special
lacking
complexity
and
i
was
hoping
for
more
of
a
sour
punch
as
the
nose
was
hinting
it
could
have
at
the
price
of
7375ml
i
would
choose
rodenbach
grand
cru
instead
everytime
overall
is
bacchus
a
watered
down
version
of
what
a
true
flanders
oud
bruin
should
be
possibly
but
it
works
here
especially
for
a
beer
at
4
5
abv
in
comparison
the
grand
cru
seems
sweeter
and
fruitier
and
brighter
in
terms
of
flavor
it
just
seems
to
have
more
going
on
o
definitely
not
the
best
sour
but
the
taste
is
quite
nice
appearance
and
smell
are
both
disappointing
poured
into
a
pint
glass
o
you
could
wake
me
at
night
to
drink
one
overall
didnt
love
it
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
give
this
one
a
chance
mf
sharp
fizzy
dry
this
dark
brown
beer
has
a
poorly
retained
neck
the
style
expects
more
retention
the
aroma
brings
cherries
peppery
tones
and
molasses
and
woodlike
tones
the
malt
both
in
aroma
and
taste
should
be
more
pronounced
here
expressed
as
toffee
the
aroma
expressed
well
the
acidity
and
despite
the
aging
of
2
5
years
no
vinegar
notes
the
cheeriness
is
expressed
both
in
aroma
and
taste
and
is
very
pleasant
the
body
is
medium
super
carbonated
oily
and
smooth
the
end
is
acid
pleasant
but
brief
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
is
a
little
on
the
pricey
side
but
makes
for
a
nice
sour
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
i
like
certain
aspects
of
this
beer
a
lot
but
feels
a
bit
thin
where
it
counts
smell
taste
still
its
not
to
bad
overall
this
is
one
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
granted
i
like
the
style
in
general
still
i
would
gladly
have
this
again
and
gladly
recommend
it
overall
another
good
flanders
slightly
more
focused
on
the
cherry
as
opposed
to
other
malts
or
funkiness
good
for
those
who
have
had
a
lot
of
lambics
and
are
looking
to
expand
d
not
my
favorite
but
glad
to
try
sour
predominant
aroma
also
as
expected
a
sour
taste
and
vinegar
fruity
specially
citric
lemon
great
beer
to
drink
as
a
bridge
to
the
most
lambic
sour
beers
great
drinkability
good
surprise
o
disappointing
because
it
lacks
flavours
and
body
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
with
tiny
don
holike
bubbles
smells
like
oak
cherries
and
leather
sounds
like
an
ad
for
70s
aftershave
somehow
the
taste
is
very
mild
with
prominent
sour
cherries
and
some
of
that
leather
did
i
mention
that
its
mild
i
think
my
70s
aftershave
model
has
mellowed
in
his
old
age
the
mouthfeel
is
very
slightly
carbonated
not
much
to
write
about
overall
its
lighter
than
i
expected
its
not
nearly
as
intense
as
some
in
the
style
maybe
this
is
the
beginner
version
only
big
downside
6
00plus
for
a
12
7oz
bottle
id
give
this
an
8485
b
m
light
bodied
lively
carbonation
o
this
has
some
nice
classic
flanders
character
but
it
is
a
bit
onedimensional
with
not
much
depth
it
is
smooth
and
soft
and
grows
a
bit
as
it
opens
but
never
gets
much
character
aroma
is
strong
yeasty
and
fruity
pours
a
dark
slightly
hazy
brown
with
a
thick
finebubbled
persistent
light
tan
head
rich
and
fruit
flavor
is
more
like
a
cider
than
a
beer
with
a
firm
apply
tone
and
hints
of
malt
and
yeast
hmmm
dont
believe
ive
ever
had
a
flanders
oude
bruin
before
smooth
texture
has
good
fizz
firm
body
and
an
interesting
nip
to
it
a
refreshing
and
distinctive
beer
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
period
amazingly
complex
a
million
flavors
but
i
could
suck
it
back
without
a
thought
if
i
wanted
to
a
very
balanced
and
humble
version
of
the
style
hits
all
necessary
points
but
doesnt
excel
at
anything
in
particular
this
is
the
first
selfproclaimed
sour
ale
ive
had
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
but
cant
give
it
higher
scores
without
knowing
the
style
better
pours
brownish
mahogany
in
color
with
a
very
small
just
off
white
head
smells
like
a
sour
beer
with
some
notes
of
cherries
and
toffee
in
the
shadows
flavor
is
brett
like
sour
at
first
but
in
a
slightly
sweet
tempered
way
relaxed
compared
to
others
notes
of
sugary
dried
fruit
come
into
play
as
well
feel
is
a
bit
sticky
in
the
mouth
not
as
crisp
as
i
like
these
beers
to
be
i
feel
it
detracts
from
the
overall
experience
turning
into
a
rather
funky
aftertaste
in
time
still
good
carbonation
and
medium
body
i
would
have
another
i
need
to
experiment
more
in
this
style
pours
a
dark
burgundy
amber
brown
color
with
a
fine
khaki
tan
head
highly
carbonated
fine
bubbles
minimal
lacing
speckled
in
even
patterns
forms
with
each
sip
aroma
a
hint
of
dark
roasted
malt
character
with
underlying
sliced
apple
fruit
notes
with
a
lingering
acidity
noted
in
each
sip
flavor
is
outstanding
absolutely
nice
and
refreshing
oud
bruin
not
up

stands
up

some
of
the
best
versions
out
there
d
this
is
a
solid
flanders
oud
bruin
i
sometimes
find
this
style
to
have
too
much
vinegar
but
this
one
has
a
nice
combination
of
fruits
vinegar
and
funk
i
would
recommend
trying
this
if
you
get

chance

a

thin
and
lightly
flavored
clearly
well
made
but
flavors
are
not
appealing
to
me
interesting
to
try
but
probably
not
again
this
is
a
very
light
oud
bruin
to
my
tastes
its
a
little
subdued
but
i
can
see
how
this
is
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
overall
good
sour
i
am
glad
to
have
had
it
a
bit
pricier
than
some
but
better
tasting
than
some
i
liked
the
heavier
mouthfeel
it
has
overall
cutting
flavour
would
be
great
as
a
dessert
beer
and
the
tartness
is
just
right
consumed
from
a
dogfish
head
snifter
this
is
better
paired
with
fatty
strong
flavored
foods
however
the
green
bottle
may
have
done
an
injustice
and
i
will
have
to
try
it
another
time
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
gladly
have
it
again
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
definitely
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
the
only
bad
thing
i
would
say
about
this
beer
is
that
the
smell
and
taste
were
not
as
intense
as
others
in
the
style
so
it
did
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the

sour
and
faint
white
grape
in
the
taste
sour
white
grapes
and
pears
with
a
nice
dry
end
a
sour
bite
and
medium

lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with

dry
sour
white
grape
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
sour
with
a
touch
of
fruit
and
a
nice
dry
end
o
worthy
of
a
buy
even
at
the
price
if
you
like
oud
bruin
buy
this
beer
im
so
glad
to
have
finally
tried
this
my
first
bottle
happens
to
be
a
vintage
one
from
what
i
understand
this
is
a
classic
to
the
style
i
pay
my
respects
would
pick
up
again
love
the
burgundies
of
belgium
pours
a
brownish
red
clear
and
little
head
retention
aromas
of
red
wine
vinegar
sugary
malts
and

belgian

in
the
taste
a
nice
lactic
sour
candi
sugar
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
wood
tone
tannins
nice
tartness
and
light
to
medium
bodied
feel
overall
a
solid
oud
bruin
with
a
good
deal
of
funk
i
can
dig
it
overall
impression
very
easy
for
the
style
ive
had
this
ontap
before
but
this
time
didnt
go
over
so
well
with
the
palate
sweet
and
citrus
tasting
but
not
much
body
or
anything
else
would
like
to
try
many
other
brews
in
this
style
but
am
going
to
look
out
for
bigger
and
better
ones
dark
red
nearing
brown
hue
small
wisp
of
head
nose
is
mostly
tart
cherry
and
vinegar
a
bit
of
bready
malt
as
well
flavors
are
lightly
sour
cherry
vinegar
and
toffee
medium
body
with
very
mild
carbonation
not
a
big
sour
blast
but
it
gets
the
job
done
i
like
this
much
more
than
monks
or
duchess
in
the
bottle
overall
just
slightly
better
than
average
oud
bruin
not
something
id
drink
again
but
not
something
im
having
difficulty
drinking
right
now
not
as
complex
as
some
other
examples
of
the
style
but
no
real
flaws
or
turnoffs
pretty
tasty
brew
i
really
enjoyed
this
solid
solid
beer
def
different
and
really
for
the
beer
geek
imo
you
would
be
hard
pressed
trying
this
out
on
a

it
might
be
a

that
subsided
to

slowly
maintained
excellent

throughout

the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet

tart

the
flavor
was
of
sweet

sour
cherry
cream
and
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
am
a
decent
fan
of
this
style
and
this
one
really
didnt
disappoint
me
too
much
i
like
the
fact
that
i
was
able
to
pick
up
on
the
cream
aspect
i
mentioned
in
the
flavor
as
it
helped
to
balance
out
the
tart
flavors
going
on
this
made
the
brew
much
more
enjoyable
for
me

you
get

encourage
constant

could
be
a

nicer
with
a

complexity
bacchus
is
just
the
thing
to
serve
those
people
who
think
of
beer
as
nothing
but
bland
yellow
sodawater
it
showcases
that
the
complexities
in
flavour
smell
and
texture
achieved
from
malted
grain
can
rival
even
somewhat
mimic
every
bit
those
of
fermented
grapes
it
should
also
greatly
appeal
to
those
like
whiskey
sours
and
similar
cocktails
overall
a
real
interesting
and
rewarding
brew
a
great
sour
beer
overall
this
would
be
a
good
stater
beer
for
someone
new
to
the
style
the
flavours
are
there
but
they
arent
too
over
the
top
and
in
your
face
its
actually
pretty
drinkable
i
could
have
a
few
i
also
really
like
the
bottle
and
the
packaging
worth
buying
very
pleasant
introduction
to
the
style
really
reminds
me
of
a
lambic
or
gueze

the
strong

will
seek
this
beerstyle
out
again
for

some

intense

as
many
other
beers
of
this

but
it
is
still
nice
a
bit
thin
for
the
mouthfeel
ill
probably
pick
up
a
few
of
these
since
we
dont
have
many
of
this
style
coming
into
ontario
overall
a
nice
beer
but
not
as
good
as
the
best
mentioned
above
o
good
but
not
necessarily
great
more
of
a
dynamic
taste
would
probably
put
this
into
the
next
level
however
still
a
decent
flanders

light

some

across

sour
that
doesnt
really
resemble
the
complexities
of
the
real
deal
simple
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
would
drink
it
again
just
dont
expect
a
proper
flanders

its

a
good
introductory
flemish
red
but
not
nearly
as
bold
and
puckery
as
i
would
have
liked
this
is
not
a
style
that
i
have
a
tonne
of
experience
with
but
this
beer
didnt
impress
me
that
much
happy
to
finish
it
but
it
certainly
was
not
particularly
exciting
this
one
wont
win
accolades
from
the
soreheads
among
the
beer
geek
crowd
but
itll
hit
a
sweet
note
with
a
wider
public
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
closer
to
brown
than
red
with
a
tight
and
creamy
light
tan
head
aromas
a
delicate
and
complex
mix
of
acetic
sourness
with
some
mustiness
and
cherry
fruit
some
oak
comes
out
as
it
warms
taste
is
light
vinegarsourness
up
front
with
definite
cherry
and
tannic
undertones
all
of
the
flavours
quickly
vanish
leaving
a
finish
that
is
very
crisp
with
little
aftertaste
aside
from
something
that
hints
at
red
wine
light
body
that
is
accentuated
with
solid
tingly
carbonation
a
nice
flanders
red
with
a
great
flavour
profile
just
comes
off
a
bit
too
watered
down
pours
a
deep
nut
brown
color
almost
auburn
with
foamy

active
carbonation
and
good
head
retention
all
yeast
in
the
aroma
lots
of
spicy
funk
up
front
balanced
with
fruity
esters
flavor
is
fruity
and
malty
very
tart
at
first
as
the
palate
adjusts
the
beer
gets
pretty
sweet
and
quite
fruity
with
raspberry
and
cherry
flavors
coming
out
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
heavy
from
the
sweetness
at
first
but
the
carbonation
helps
to
lighten
it
up
and
thin
it
out
a
bit
bottle
at
sin
and
redemption
more
or
less
balanced

for
the

eraser
not

for
me
good
drinkability
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
sourness
and
flavors
seem
to
be
somewhat
muted
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
this
falls
a
bit
short
for
me
i
dont
really
care
for
the
cola
flavor
and
the
tartness
seems
like
an
afterthought
the
most
appealing
part
is
the
aroma
though
it
is
one
dimensional
overall
very
nice
and
balanced
much
better
than
the
fresh
one
although
still
a
bit
too
sweet
for
the

i
think
its
a

o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
has
some
ok
qualities
but
is
too
uneven
to
wholly
recommend
d
worst
mouthfeel
aside
from
curdy
perhaps
i
can
imagine
just
tried
this
brew
i
have
to
say
i
like
it
better
than
lindemans
a
good
flemish
sour
but
not
the
greatest
a
bit
tangy
oak
aged
fruity
and
floral
aromas
make
for
a
delightful
experience
but
i
am
just
not
ready
for
it
yet
i
do
believe
this
is
an
up
and
comer
in
the
flemish
sours
worth
a
double
take
and
try
not
bad
but
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
i
expect
from
a
flanders
red
pours
a
moderate
reddishbrown
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
some
spotted
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
some
light
malt
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
very
faint
presence
of
cherries
and
light
sourness
the
flavor
has
mostly
light
malt
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
very
very
light
cherry
and
acidity
not
much
of
a
flanders
medium
body
and
slightly
creamy
decent
enough
but
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
bubbly
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
light
brown
head
the
head
vanishes
very
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
fermented
cherry
aroma
with
some
oaky
aromas
too
the
taste
is
slightly
tart
with
some
soft
cherry
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
there
is
a
bitter
vinegar
flavor
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
has
a
generous
amount
of
carbonation
overall
its
a
decent
flanders
red
not
overly
thrilled
with
some
of
the
flavors
d
too
straightforward
and
mild
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
to
mention
much
at
all
od
not
too
bad
but
the
finish
was
a
little
disapointing
definately
a
starter
for
the
style
otherwise
note
to
self
avoid
flanders
red
ale
d
this
was
not
nearly
as
sour
or
tart
as
expected
with
nice
sweet
balance
decent
body
and
low
alcohol
made
it
easy
to
drink
i
would
consider
this
a
gateway
beer
into
the
sour
ales
but
its
a
bit
bland
if
youre
already
used
to
lambics
or
more
tart
beers
below
average
flanders
red
for
me
should
have
been
less
sweet
the
sweetness
should
have
been
tastier
and
a
tad
more
sour
wouldnt
hurt
there
was
a
lot
of
things
i
liked
about
this
particular
beer
but
none
of
them
took
over
and
made
the
beer
amazing
i
feel
its
kind
of
stuck
in
the
middle
area
between
not
bad
but
not
great
just
ok
nice
sour
notes
on
the
palate
but
not
much
nose
to
it
its
a
well
rounded
beer
but
nothing
that
makes
me
seek
this
out
again
just
another
beer
on
the
craft
beer
journey
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
its
not
much
id
go
for
lots
of
other
flanders
beers
over
this
and
they
dont
cost
any
more
o
this
is
a
good
beer
it
just
seems
as
though
it
has
been
watered
down
in
a
lot
of
ways
definitely
check
it
out
if
youre
new
to
the
style
but
there
are
better
out
there
opinion
this
really
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
prefer
my
flanders
to
be
much
more
bold
like
rodanbach
but
this
is
still
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
as
they
hop
city
guy
stated
it
would
be
good
for
someone
new
to
flanders
it
is
actually
easier
to
try
than
the
duchesse
all
this
said
i
will
stick
to
other
examples
but
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
this
one
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
9or
your
girlfriend
wanted
to
try
something
different
and
you
arent
familiar
with
the
flanders
styles
this
would
be
a
very
good
introduction
to
the
style
d
its
a
sour
flanders
but
pretty
easy
to
drink
a
12
7
oz
was
enough
for
me
i
will
drink
this
one
again
but
wont
be
seeking
it
out
brown
with
a
ruby
tinge
the
beer
is
clear
enough
to
see
the
carbonation
that
sustains
the
foamy
ring
around
the
top
but
you
cant
see
through
it
the
smell
is
sour
of
course
and
sweet
with
stone
fruit
and
grape
the
fruits
and
sourness
carry
over
into
the
taste
but
the
sweetness
is
knocked
back
a
bit
and
its
surprisingly
drier
than
the
nose
led
me
to
believe
there
is
a
tingle
from
the
carbonation
and
the
sour
notes
play
on
the
tongue
adding
to
the
tingling
sensation
light
to
mediumbodied
this
is
a
beer
for
you
sour
beer
lovers
out
there
but
if
youre
looking
for
major
pucker
this
one
wont
supply
it
its
a
little
fruity
not
overly
sweet
and
moderately
sour
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
almost
brown
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
firm
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sour
cherries
raspberries
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
is
full
of
sour
cherries
with
a
nice
tartness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
think
this
would
pair
beautifully
with
brunch
i
will
certainly
drink
it
again
375ml
bottle
thanks
to
brewerdan
appreciate
it
dark
redbrown
like
you
would
expect
with
minimal
head
smells
a
little
bit
like
vinegar
but
not
enough
for
my
liking
taste
is
mildly
sour
mellow
almost
too
mellow
i
honestly
have
a
hard
time
finding
flanders
reds
that
i
like
duchesse
and
zoetzuur
are
probably
the
only
ones
i
really
really
like
pours
a
dark
iced
tea
color
with
a
1
inch
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
miniscule
layer
of
foam
lacing
is
minimal
and
patchy
on
the
glass
smell
is
of
mild
vinegar
sour
cherries
and
some
woody
notes
taste
is
mildly
sour
cherry
with
a
vinegar
zing
that
is
somewhat
subdued
no
bitterness
to
speak
of
beer
has
a
very
lively
carbonation
that
is
refreshing
but
it
leaves
a
sticky
coating
in
the
mouth
like
soda
will
do
drinkability
is
good
but
i
have
had
better
examples
of
this
style
so
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
beer
again
d
surprising
that
ive
never
really
even
heard
this
beer
mentioned
its
a
pretty
decent
flanders
red
and
a
good
price
the
beer
looks
good
and
has
the
nose
characteristic
of
the
style
with
maybe
a
touch
too
much
vinegar
that
by
the
way
is
the
story
with
this
beer
there
are
too
many
wild
yeast
flavors
some
moldy
cheese
notes
with
too
much
vinegar
that
really
detracts
from
the
characteristic
sours
and
sweets
of
the
style
the
beer
is
decent
but
why
settle
for
second
best
there
isnt
enough
tart
cherry
not
enough
complexity
not
enough
wood
barrel
notes
and
just
too
much
of
the
wild
yeasty
vinegars
its
okay
but
ill
stick
with
rodenbach
and
duchesse
any
day
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
a
clear
deep
copper
reddish
orange
color
with
a
light
tan
1
finger
head
lots
of
flavors
in
the
nose
apple
cinnamon
and
banana
all
with
an
underlying
sour
grape
aroma
light
mouthfeel
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
starts
with
a
dark
fruit
like
sweetness
with
a
tinge
of
sourness
like
lemon
that
slowly
fades
and
ends
rather
cleanly
i
dont
pick
up
too
much
oak
in
this
except
maybe
at
the
end
but
ever
so
slightly
complex
no
not
really
but
its
pretty
easy
drinking
and
has
a
mild
sourness
that
i
find
nice
d
this
is
a
very
nice
flanders
red
ale
but
there
are
better
out
there
this
vlaams
oud
bruin
comes
in
a
375
ml
green
champagne
bottle
with
a
crown
cap
and
foil
seal
bottled
090414
which
could
actually
be
the
bestby
date
pours
with
filtered
clarity
the
color
of
cherrywood
highlycarbonated
with
a
moussy
head
that
climbs
out
of
the
glass
and
has
great
retention
the
aroma
is
light
but
its
enough
to
kick
in
the
saliva
glands
nice
sweetsour
balance
with
stonefruits
toastedcaramel
malts
and
a
light
but
surprising
green
hop
flavor
on
top
of
a
light
and
dry
almost
tannic
body
with
a
nice
carbonic
tingle
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
make
a
painless
introduction
for
those
leery
of
sour
reds
but
i
dont
feel
it
is
to
style
it
almost
tastes
like
a
red
ale
that
has
had
lactic
acid
added
to
it
or
has
been
mildly
soured
and
then
pasteurized
either
way
its
not
too
shabby
but
perhaps
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
to
find
it
my
bottle
says
its
an
oude
brune
but
seems
to
be
the
same
beer
though
nothing
overly
special
about
this
one
but
certainly
a
nice
drink
love
it
d
this
is
a
classy
classic
example
of
this
style
its
not
a
vinegar
mess
like
the
most
well
known
example
of
this
styleand
its
not
anywhere
near
as
tart
or
extreme
as
the
american
examples
its
simply
flanders
redwith
a
lot
of
oak
barrel
flavor
and
some
vanilla
some
charry
and
some
tarness
my
only
complaint
about
this
is
that
the
body
is
slightly
thin
if
the
flavor
were
a
bit
fuller
this
would
be
world
class
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
flanders
red
not
as
tasty
as
rodenbach
red
or
duchesse
but
still
decent
overall
this
flanders
ale
is
a
bit
more
mild
and
straight
forward
than
others
i
have
had
but
it
is
refreshing
and
tasty
as
well
very
drinkable
i
would
have
this
again
my
bottle
got
froze
so
pours
with
i
think
is
a
damaged
by
freezing
weird
looking
head
but
still
not
bad
foamy
frothy
fluffy
sudsy
and
clumpy
that
lasts
forever
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
medium
brown
aroma
is
a
bit
fruity
tart
malt
and
actually
fresh
flavor
is
malty
tart
fruity
body
still
has
some
ice
in
it
so
there
you
go
finish
is
like
flavor
and
not
bad
kind
of
tasty
actually
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
solid
pale
and
crystal
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
sourness
it
doesnt
appear
to
be
too
complex
but
its
refreshing
nonetheless
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
very
thin
crystal
malt
flavor
along
with
a
crisp
refreshing
sourness
its
incredibly
simplistic
with
little
malt
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
forgettable
flanders
ale
im
not
a
fan
of
the
malt
profile
its
too
light
and
devoid
of
complexity
this
beer
is
really
juicy
and
sweet
it
has
apples
and
a
bit
of
raspberry
and
mango
its
hard
to
nail
down
exactly
all
of
the
esters
in
here
its
really
got
a
nice
bouqet
the
woodiness
in
here
is
a
bit
chalky
and
musty
upfront
it
almost
tastes
as
if
the
wood
was
practically
rotting
but
as
far
as
i
know
most
barrels
used
in
this
kind
of
procedure
are
up
to
100
years
old
the
sore
thumb
that
this
shows
actually
winds
up
blending
in
quite
nicely
a
ways
into
the
bottle
it
turns
out
to
be
quite
a
nice
example
of
this
style
the
bottle
was
over
a
year
a
half
old
i
might
try
a
fresh
pressed
one
to
see
what
kind
of
differences
were
made
if
any
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
with
a
cherrylike
fruitiness
sourness
is
pretty
mild
and
keeps
the
vinegar
aspect
low
a
bit
like
the
duchesse
but
not
nearly
as
sweet
carbonation
is
soft
and
fine
and
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
uberhigh
as
the
sourness
is
not
too
acidic
abv
is
moderate
and
malts
are
soft
and
tame
very
good
i
will
surely
buy
this
again
next
time
i
see
it
pours
very
dark
amber
almost
chestnut
brown
white
head
is
creamy
smooth
and
leaves
a
nice
rim
layer
aroma
is
fairly
full
with
some
ripe
fruits
on
the
palate
is
a
pleasant
sweetsour
that
is
awfully
similar
to
what
i
get
with
duchesse
du
bourgogne
passion
fruit
light
vinegar
good
way
and
amazing
carbonation
to
help
give
it
a
stellar
mouthfeel
finishes
smooth
on
the
palate
with
the
above
flavors
mingling
nicely
i
enjoyed
this
beer
not
as
sour
as
expected
but
very
drinkable
for
me
will
pick
up
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
definitely
an
interesting
brew
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
but
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
poured
a
faded
red
body
w
a
minimal
pinkish
head
that
died
quick
but
left
some
lace
patches
mostly
a
faint
cherry
and
tart
fruit
aroma
but
also
a
minimal
amount
of
oakiness
and
sweet
malt
taste
is
same
as
this
is
a
simple
but
enjoyable
red
ale
as
the
tart
cherry
taste
is
minor
and
the
thin
body
passes
smooth
and
clean
over
tongue
has
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
there
as
well
for
balance
and
the
carbonation
leads
to
a
crisp
but
not
cutting
backbite
simple
and
not
best
representation
of
style
but
enjoyable
w
a
meal
drinkability
a
rather
unchallenging
flanders
red
though
pleasant
enough
to
drink
db
very
interesting
best
described
as
monks
cafe
light
very
subdued
and
well
balanced
flavor
i
love
interesting
beer
drinkability
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
it
is
that
the
color
when
held
to
a
light
is
very
pretty
it
just
doesnt
compete
well
with
any
number
of
other
flanders
red
beers
many
will
find
it
ok
and
comfortable
if
they
have
no
expectations
for
it
being
a
good
beer
for
the
style
d
this
is
a
wonderful
sour
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
long
this
is
a
beer
that
when
you
see
it
you
should
pick
it
up
d
tartsour
with
high
carbonation
combined
with
the
low
abv
makes
this
a
really
pleasantly
drinkable
flanders
like
others
have
said
this
would
be
a
great
entryway
beer
to
the
world
of
sours
claptons
the
shape
youre
in
just
makes
me
wanna
drink
something
if
only
twere
about
beer
this
guy
pours
a
dark
rubytinted
brown
topped
by
finger
or
so
of
darkish
ecru
foam
the
nose
comprises
red
grapes
watereddown
vinegar
a
light
must
black
cherries
and
a
hint
of
raspberries
the
taste
tones
the
vinegar
down
to
a
nice
degree
adding
only
a
subtle
twang
of
acidity
the
fruits
and
berries
remain
with
the
must
being
toned
down
a
notch
as
well
with
some
figs
nutmeg
and
mandarin
oranges
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
stalwart
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nearly
sticky
finish
overall
a
nice
flanders
brown
not
the
most
characteristic
of
the
style
but
tasty
and
enjoyable
nonetheless
d
well
it
was
decent
but
probably
nothing
worth
seeking
out
i
enjoyed
the
glass
i
had
and
ordered
something
else
i
tried
it
anyway
and
im
glad
i
did
she
was
dead
on
not
as
sour
but
still
good
and
refreshing
it
was
nice
given
that
i
was
sitting
outside
in
90
degree
heat
d
worthwhile
smooth
darkeramber
ale
pours
a
coppery
red
with
a
half
inch
of
khaki
head
that
recedes
quickly
very
little
tartness
in
the
nose
mild
sweetnessa
grainy
something
or
other
honestly
there
is
so
little
going
on
in
the
nose
its
almost
not
worth
mentioning
thin
soft
mouthfeel
not
nearly
enough
sharpness
or
acidity
for
the
style
a
delicately
tart
cherry
sweetness
with
a
grainy
finish
that
fades
almost
instantly
this
beer
was
a
tease
it
did
not
satisfy
my
craving
for
a
flemish
sour
this
beer
is
definitely
growing
on
me
as
im
drinking
the
glass
not
the
best
representation
of
this
style
but
it
is
a
good
and
tasty
beer
perhaps
a
good
introduction
to
this
style
for
some
d
though
this
is
not
what
i
expected
from
the
brewers
description
it
was
a
damned
easy
drinking
ale
that
i
would
have
again
with
pleasure
could
be
a
great
gateway
beer
to
introduce
someone
to
sours
d
although
it
is
smooth
i
feel
i
have
to
deduct
based
on
style
what
makes
a
flanders
red
so
drinkable
for
me
is
that
more
acidic
sour
taste
which
this
does
not
deliver
it
doesnt
capture
my
palates
attention
for
that
long
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
strong
carbonation
very
impressive
for
a
beer
of
4
5
abv
one
would
think
this
is
a
much
stronger
beer
and
is
amazing
at
that
low
of
an
abv
drinkability
i
like
this
style
and
would
choose
this
beer
over
several
styles
that
being
said
this
one
is
very
light
and
the
sourness
that
i
usually
get
is
quite
subdued
if
i
was
looking
for
a
beer
i
would
pick
this
up
if
i
was
looking
for
a
flanders
red
i
would
see
if
there
was
something
else
on
the
shelf
a
good
flanders
but
lacks
the
intensity
of
flavors
found
in
duchesse
du
burgogne
or
rodenbach
drinkability
is
okay
in
that
its
bland
and
light
my
palate
adjusted
to
the
iron
and
i
was
able
to
easily
forget
about
it
about
a
13rd
of
the
way
through
however
it
doesnt
have
the
tartness
or
complexity
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
therefore
was
not
worth
the
7
it
cost
me
to
ever
revisit
i
can
get
a
750
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
for
only
a
little
bit
more
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
oak
tannins
and
red
wine
the
flavor
is
similar
to
red
wine
with
some
oak
notes
and
caramel
malt
mild
tartness
and
very
dry
the
beer
has
a
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
this
might
be
the
best
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
a
solid
beer
decent
unexceptional
example
of
the
style
it
might
make
a
good
introduction
to
sours
but
there
are
more
interesting
variants
out
there
pours
a
vinegar
brown
with
no
head
this
beer
smells
pleasantly
of
vinegarketchup
there
have
been
a
few
others
in
this
style
namely
the
duchess
that
have
a
similar
smell
but
this
has
more
a
vinegar
aroma
medium
carbination
the
sweet
flavors
kick
through
the
bubbles
the
most
if
this
beer
was
ketchup
it
would
be
the
best
ketchup
ever
im
not
well
versed
on
flanders
red
ales
but
im
a
huge
fan
nonetheless
this
combines
a
hint
of
sour
with
a
nice
sweet
flavor
found
in
bruins
the
bottle
tells
you
nothing
of
the
beers
style
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
pour
this
beer
to
find
out
its
style
to
be
honest
theres
nothing
super
special
about
his
beer
other
than
its
very
tasty
its
less
intense
than
the
duchess
which
is
good
for
people
interested
in
the
style
check
this
shit
out
a
decent
sour
though
a
bit
mild
this
one
is
mostly
acidic
but
the
beer
is
rather
light
in
flavor
and
feel
at
least
relatively
fresh
so
its
still
fairly
easy
to
drink
bacchus
pours
a
deep
red
with
a
shade
or
two
of
brown
small
ecru
head
aroma
is
too
mild
but
there
are
some
nice
sweet
and
sour
cherry
notes
and
hints
of
grain
flavor
is
a
bit
better
with
more
acidity
a
light
funk
and
mild
malt
feel
is
a
bit
thin
which
isnt
really
a
big
surprise
but
its
still
a
fairly
easy
beer
to
drink
d
easy
to
drink
not
the
best
but
solid
as
a
whole
12
7
ounce
green
bottle
black
foil
over
the
cap
no
bargain

in

ny
bottled
on

dark
brown
with
a
burnt
red
hue
thick
light
mocha
head
that
stays
and
stays
then
goes
to
a
thick
film
collar
and
respectable
if
not
amazing
strands
of
lace
i
get
a
healthy
load
of
must
and
tart
fruit
in
the
nose
ah
flanders
red
what
a
wonderful
style
and
this
one
was
not
bad
moderatly
tart
no
real
sour
bite
some
tart
cherry
notes
a
bit
more
musty
character
midway
and
in
the
finish
not
bad
i
think
some
stinky
cheese
and
crusty
bread
would
compliment
this
selection
well
worth
a
try
good
gateway
sourbelgian
red
there
is
quite
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
to
this
beer
but
it
really
has
just
been
watered
down
too
much
a
more
concentrated
version
would
likely
be
phenomenal
for
this
reason
i
find
this
beer
quite
disappointing
i
think
this
is
a
great
little
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
any
one
getting
into
sours
overall
quite
a
disappointment
there
are
far
better
examples
of
the
style
for
a
similar
price
notably
duchesse
and
rodenbach
extraordinarily
boring
in
most
every
way
overall
a
not
bad
refreshing
oud
bruin
i
found
it
in
a
michael
jacksons
beers
of
the
world
book
would
be
a
good
intro
to
the
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
my
first
introduction
to
sours
and
i
can
say
that
id
like
to
try
a
few
more
would
probably
even
pick
this
up
again
if
it
were
a
little
cheaper
around
here
worth
a
try
though
maybe
its
someone
elses
thing
d
despite
its
downfalls
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
sessionable
even
i
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
a
thirst
quencher
i
could
drink
these
all
day
any
season
of
the
year
notes
this
is
a
classic
belgian
brewerys
flemish
red
ale
which
was
solid
it
was
great
to
find
it
on
tap
at
hopcat
a
world
class
beer
advocate
place
d
its
not
jawdroppingly
complex
but
it
is
incredibly
refreshing
i
wish
i
had
tried
this
in
the
summer
recommended
for
fans
of
sour
ales
on
tap
at
the
cheeky
monk
in
denver
clear
dark
red
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
aroma
is
both
sweet
and
sour
with
cherry
apple
oak
and
mild
funk
flavor
is
a
tiny
bit
tart
but
mostly
just
sweet
with
cherry
apple
sweet
malt
and
a
metallic
acidic
finish
the
description
calls
this
winelike
not
very
accurate
body
is
mediumlight
with
moderately
high
carbonation
drinkability
averageplus
but
the
metallic
flavor
hurts
it
here
not
a
huge
fan
overall
d
this
is
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
sour
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
astringent
with
good
fruitiness
of
character
d
this
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
had
a
little
more
carbonation
to
it
overall
not
the
worst
beer
in
this
style
but
far
from
the
best
rereviewed
this
and
not
nearly
as
impressed
this
time
its
quite
drinkable
with
the
lower
abv
but
im
not
sure
if
id
want
a
ton
of
this
light
body
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
an
average
beer
but
i
have
had
better
and
i
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
i
would
probably
give
it
a
shot
if
i
found
in
a
bottle
this
is
a
less
intense
version
of
a
sour
red
it
has
a
brownish
amber
color
to
it
a
sweet
berry
maltiness
and
carmelized
malts
like
drinking
caramel
strawberries
the
intensity
of
the
sourness
is
low
on
this
one
but
its
there
a
good
beer
of
its
style
for
the
beginner
but
still
solid
for
the
veteran
to
appreciate
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
it
about
ends
there
drinkability
i
havent
purchased
a
snow
cone
in
maybe
17
years
but
i
cant
imagine
they
cost
more
than
2
today
and
thats
certainly
cheaper
than
a
6
beer
plus
with
the
snow
cone
you
get
to
enjoy
the
icy
flavorful
part
first
on
tap
at
hamiltons
tavern
in
san
diego
during
the
rbsg
08
pubcrawl
dark
orange
bronze
with
a
tan
head
aroma
is
acidic
with
tart
cherries
and
a
slight
metallic
character
flavor
is
berries
with
an
acetic
sharpness
fairly
tart
but
a
little
too
sweet
poor
mans
duchesse
du
bourgogne
still
not
bad
this
goes
down
pretty
easily
although
the
the
sweetness
dominates
the
brew
it
is
not
sickening
or
offputting
i
could
see
this
as
a
nice
brew
on
a
hot
day
d
tastes
artificially
sweetened
with
either
juice
or
sugar
refreshing
just
not
as
tart
or
sour
as
i
had
expected
at
4
5
its
actually
pretty
drinkable
if
not
onedimensional
it
paired
pretty
well
with
a
roast
beef
sandwich
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
tartness
leading
to
a
dry
thin
finish
eric
d
not
a
bad
red
by
any
means
not
up
to
par
with
rodenbach
but
a
good
sour
ale
in
its
own
right
i
enjoyed
it
drinkability
perfectly
fine
flanders
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
sour
but
it
does
work
nice
the
way
it
is
on
tap
at
stone
world
bistro
gardens
i
had
this
back
to
back
with
a
monks
cafe
flemish
sour
both
had
about
the
same
fruitiness
to
them
but
this
bacchus
had
a
slightly
more
sharp
sourness
whereas
the
monks
cafe
was
more
muted
in
that
respect
i
think
the
bacchus
also
had
a
somewhat
lighter
body
and
the
monks
felt
a
bit
more
soft
i
like
it
ok
but
not
super
impressed
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
can
think
of
several
that
i
would
prefer
over
this
one
review
added
12082007
translated
from
french
1202008
overall
the
sourness
is
mild
and
refreshing
and
the
beer
is
decent
enough
many
afficionados
of
the
style
will
want
something
with
more
punch
panil
bariquee
or
rodenbach
for
example
but
this
is
pleasant
enough
and
a
nice
thirstquencher
25
cl

on
label
nice
tartness
but
not
overly
tasteful
little
fruitniness
im
a
sucker
for
the
style
so
i
liked
it
but
its
no
rodenbach
bottle
poured
a
clear
red
colored
beer
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
disappeared
aroma
of
oak
is
clearly
present
thought
not
has
much
as
in
other
example
such
as
rodenbach
taste
is
slightly
tart
with
some
nice
touch
of
oak
and
very
subtle
cheery
probably
of
the
best
effort
from
this
brewery
interestingly
the
russian
translation
of
the
label
declares
this
a
pale
beer
not
likely
deep
mahogany
red
that
is
remarkably
clear
for
an
unfiltered
beer
the
head
was
very
fizzy
and
so
short
lived
i
didnt
even
get
a
chance
to
notice
the
color
my
guess
based
on
the
collar
that
still
sits
above
the
liquid
would
be
reddish
tan
the
nose
is
full
of
cherry
the
mouth
is
very
carbonated
and
heavy
with
fruit
sweetness
the
cherry
attacks
the
tastebuds
immediately
hitting
with
both
sweet
and
sour
malt
lurks
somewhere
in
the
background
but
never
overcomes
the
fruit
the
aftertaste
is
clearly
sour
cherry
not
bad
if
this
is
what
you
like
i
dont
particularly
quite
a
refreshing
ale
sweetish
start
with
a
tart
sourness
towards
the
finish
as
always
a
cherryish
flavour
and
slight
caramel
maltyness
enjoyable
flanders
red
even
though
its
not
the
best
overall
held
up
rather
well
good
but
not
great
still
not
the
most
traditional
oud
bruin
its
more
of
a
bsda
alcohol
is
not
apparent
sweetness
verges
on
a
tolerable
degree
this
is
a
rubyreddark
brown
beer
its
aroma
is
misleading
it
prepares
you
for
something
else
but
the
real
taste
is
exceptional
i
especially
like
the
strong
aftertaste
its
is
a
strong
beer
both
in
taste
and
in
alcohol
so
i
wouldnt
drink
many
of
these
in
one
session
its
more
like
a
delicacy
rather
than
a
beer
i
would
suggest
you
have
this
one
with
food
it
will
go
well
with
red
meat
and
chocolate
i
dont
see
this
as
an
old
bruin
not
anywhere
near
as
sour
as
some
of
the
others
i
have
had
it
is
an
exceptionally
smooth
and
balanced
beer
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
it
is
just
a
sweet
brew
well
packaged
and
playing
on
the
belgian
beer
scene

more
and
more

and

i
paired
this
with
a

it
worked

well
with

assuring

nice

which
would
desist
into
a
fine
lacing
as
it
warmed
cloudy
brown
aroma
pairs
up
pretty
well
with
the
style
but
not
as
authentic
i
didnt
think
stronger
as
it
warmed
thats
a
good
thing
took
a
little
longer
to
get
a
feel
for
not
as
distinct
or
confident
as
others
in
this
unique
style
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
carbonated
for
a
flemish

nowhere
near
as
complex
or

as

no

dont
stick
around
they
dont

out
as
they

with
what
this
style
permits
i
liked
this
beer
but
there
is
so
much
more
to
this
style
as
this
is
my
first
oud
bruin
beer
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
but
i
liked
it
anyway
tightest
cork
ive
run
across
and
the
first
where
i
had
to
use
a
corkscrew
poured
a
ruddy
amberwalnut
with
a
quick
fizzy
head
well
carbonated
some
mildly
sweet
caramel
apple
flavor
up
front
on
the
first
sip
with
alcohol
rising
sharply
after
a
few
sips
however
caramel
and
alcohol
both
receded
aged
orchard
fruit
and
some
hints
of
oak
tannin
not
as
tart
or
acidic
as
other
oud
bruins
ive
had
for
the
high
abv
and
the
initial
alcohol
pungency
the
alcohol
did
mute
and
this
was
surprisingly
drinkable
the
cork
popped
violently
from
the
black
750ml
vondel
bottle
and
the
ruby
brown
beer
poured
with
crisp
carbonation
into
my
chalice
the
cork
has
the
year
2003
printed
on
it
the
head
was
extremely
frothy
initially
and
then
it
calmed
and
formed
a
steady
light
brown
covering
with
a
mix
of
some
big
and
small
bubbles
the
lacing
was
a
little
fizzy
but
then
turned
creamy
and
moved
slowly
down
the
glass
the
beer
possesses
deep
reds
and
rich
dark
browns
rosewood
or
even
cherry
aroma
is
of
the
dusty
yeast
raisins
faint
old
maltiness
with
only
a
small
hint
of
sourness
in
the
background
the
malt
shares
the
spotlight
with
astringent
alcohol
leather
and
strong
licorice
in
the
smell
too
giving
some
barleywine
aromas
other
notes
of
brown
sugar
horehound
and
blackberry
i
expected
some
tartness
to
the
aroma
this
being
a
flemish
brown
ale
to
me
the
smell
is
more
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
not
to
say
at
all
that
the
aroma
is
bad
despite
the
violence
with
which
this
ale
poured
the
taste
is
actually
quite
low
in
carbonation
almost
milky
and
even
a
little
flat
again
i
get
licorice
up
front
in
the
mouth
strong
dusty
malt
and
very
little
alcohol
in
the
taste
though
vondel
sends
some
pleasant
coatings
of
warmth
to
the
stomach
rather
quickly
and
deceptively
the
taste
is
well
enough
albeit
slight
on
complexity
and
the
beer
is
in
desparate
need
of
carbonationthough
i
am
not
sure
if
this
was
a
result
of
storagethis
bottle
is
over
2
years
old
there
is
some
lactaid
sourness
but
nothing
very
tart
or
fruity
about
this
beer
at
all
now
this
is
odd
the
second
glass
poured
from
the
bottle
is
actually
very
carbonated
indeed
as
for
carbonation
the
first
and
second
pours
from
this
bottle
could
be
two
different
beers
the
finish
is
mostly
malt
with
some
dryness
left
in
the
corners
of
the
mouth
the
taste
also
gives
some
plum
or
prunes
mixed
with
the
dominant
yeast
flavour
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
fickle
as
i
mentioned
but
the
beer
is
definitely
fullbodied
little
phenolic
presence
makes
it
easy
to
drink
as
well
i
was
expecting
more
complexity
but
taken
by
itself
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer

you
get

marvelous

that
turns
syrupy
with

then
some

nice

a
pleasant
surprise
very
balanced
and
complex
though
lacking
the
sournessbarnyard
flavors
i
would
expect
from
an
oud
bruin
regardless
an
excellent
beer
i
was
very
excited
to
try
a
flanders
oud
bruin
and
this
was
the
only
one
i
could
find
in
my
area
i
think
the
store
was
clearing
them
out
i
have
seem
quite
a
bit
of
this
in
the
area
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
be
moving
too
quick
the
head
on
this
was
massive
in
my
duvel
glass
without
any
aggression
in
the
pour
the
color
of
the
body
was
a
raison
brown
the
head
was
very
fluffy
and
light
and
eventually
settled
down
to
a
thin
film
that
concentrated
itself
to
the
middle
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
filled
with
raison
malt
and
small
amounts
of
alcohol
esters
there
was
also
a
cocoa
and
cherry
backbone
the
taste
was
sweet
and
tart
at
the
beggining
and
finished
a
little
dry
and
malty
the
alcohol
was
very
well
hidden
in
the
taste
but
it
hit
me
hard
midway
through
the
bottle
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
that
would
be
enjoyable
for
a
late
night
drink
pours
a
nice
copper
color
accompanied
with
a
large
frothy
carbonation
the
smell
is
different
kind
of
tart
definitely
sweet
taste
is
definitely
malty
sweet
chocolate
caramel
plums
and
yet
a
tartness
sneaks
through
from
the
bacteria
definitely
sweet
a
little
more
tartness
would
have
been
appreciated
but
overall
not
a
bad
brew
would
drink
it
again
750
ml
bottle

a
decent
beer
but
the
flavor
was
missing
complexity
this
beer
was
disappointing
a
great
bottle
design
and
expensive
too
not
a
good
value
for
the
just
nothing
special
on
tap
in
quebec
city
rusty
muddy
brown
with
a
small
almost
nonexistant
head
the
aromas
are
of
sweet
malts
sugar
and
a
bit
of
oud
bruin
lactic
funk
the
taste
is
way
too
sweet
up
front
and
not
funky
enough
for
an
oud
bruin
their
are
also
some
slight
fruit
flavors
in
this
brew
making
it
seem
like
an
oud
bruin
flemish
red
hybrid
the
mouthfeel
was
sugary
and
sticky
and
the
drinkability
was
blah
why
even
try
this
if
you
can
have

mouthfeel

malty

but
overly
so
the
maltiness
comes
across
sometimes
as
being
cardboardy
its
not
as
sour
as
i
seem
to
remember
or
maybe
the
aging
subdued
those
qualities
that
i
seem
to
foggily
remember
there
is
a
slight
woodylike
shallow
tartness
the
taste
is
pretty
bland
when
compared
to
other
beers
of
the
style
i
like
it
but
im
not
really
enthralled
with
the
beers
lack
of
character
its
just
lacking
some
gusto

wasnt
to
fond
of
the

after
awhile
a
nice

came
thru
taste
is
creamy
and
almondy
with
a
spiciness
that
lingers
really
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
not

filling
thats
a
big
plus
in
my
booka
good
beer
in
my
book
what
a
great
beer
what
a
pleasant
surprise
the
malty
lemony
and
sour
scent
is
intriguing
i
cant
wait
to
taste
this
beer
and
the
taste
sweetandsour
is
what
comes
to
mind
malty
creamy
lemony
yeasty
complex
and
delicious
mmmm
i
can
think
of
countless
foods
for
which
this
would
be
a
fantastic
pairing
brown
beer
with
a
generous
head
in
terms
of
space
but
not
in
terms
of
time
sweet
nose
of
chocolate
and
liquorice
rich

fruity
caramel
with

notes
riva
at
its
best
big
props
to
the
cheaper
state
than
most
too
around
here
anyway
this
stuff
was
awesome
i
gotta
give
much
thanks
to
my
bro
spyridon
for
hookin
me
up
at
the
super
bowl
party
it
came
in
a
huge
bottle
so
we
could
both
enjoy
our
equal
share
of
the
bounty
it
was
a
cloudy
brownishamber
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
head
stayed
around
for
a
while
the
smell
had
many
different
angles
to
it
at
first
smell
it
was
a
sweet
brown
sugary
smell
but
then
gave
way
to
a
semistrong
grapeish
smell
the
fruity
smell
carried
over
to
the
taste
but
also
had
the
token
belgian
taste
to
it
ie
the
malty
body
w
a
tinge
of
alcohol
and
dark
fruits
the
alcohol
was
hardly
present
and
made
it
even
more
enjoyable
i
really
do
think
that
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
nightday
ofcourse
my
liver
wouldnt
thank
me
for
that
so
it
would
be
impossible
this
is
the
1999
vintage
from
a
750ml
corked
bottle
definately
a
great
beer
maybe
because
of
the
vintage
i
dont
know
first
off
i
was
under
the
impression
that
a
flemish
brown
was
supposed
to
be
sour
i
e
with
some
bacteria
maybe
thats
oud
bruin
anyway
the
beer
looks
so
pretty
especially
when
swirled
about
in
a
tulip
glass
it
swirls
around
and
around
with
the
head
forming
and
mixing
with
the
uppermost
layer
of
reddish
brown
beer
oh
its
pretty
the
nose
is
nice
very
carameltoffee
maybe
some
raisons
with
definately
some
alcohol
there
the
taste
is
very
rich
very
nice
soft
fruit
flavors
mostly
raison
with
some
caramel
and
the
alcohol
is
quite
prominent
which
is
the
only
reason
i
didnt
give
this
beer
a
4
5
in
the
taste
category
finish
is
of
dry
malt
and
semibitter
chocolate
the
alcohol
is
not
detectable
in
the
flavour
but
it
certainly
is
in
your
head
overall
an
interesting
beer
which
has
apparently
aged
well
uninspiring
imho
vondel
looks
good
smells
good
and
feels
good
but
the
taste
was
one
that
i
was
not
looking
forward
to
even
after
the
first
few
sips
the
dryness
and
lasting
bitterness
overshadows
the
other
more
subtle
characteristics
this
is
a
very
rich
and
dark
ale
and
not
a
flander
red
per
say
in
my
opinion
large
head
when
pourred
into
glass
but
it
did
disapear
a
little
bit
too
quickly
has
a
very
nice
roasty
butterscotch
and
molasse
finish
another
nice
and
diffrent
product
from
riva
a
very
good
beer
to
say
the
least
the
spices
were
noticed
when
i
smelled
the
beer
the
taste
came
forward
with
some
malt
and
fruit
tones
followed
by
a
sour
note
and
a
little
hop
precence
and
abruptly
ended
with
a
dry
yeast
but
somewhat
sweet
tasting
finish
that
left
me
wanting
more
one
of
the
most
balanced
beer
i
have
tasted
to
date
and
something
i
would
definitely
buy
again
green
bottle
definitely
left
me
worried
about
reviewing
this
one
but
there
was
no
need
a
well
taken
care
of
sample
from
sharp
edge
creekhouse
pours
a
deep
amber
mahogany
with
a
beige
toned
nicely
developed
head
leaving
a
thin
collar
of
lacing
around
my
snifter
aroma
has
a
wine
like
vinous
character
to
it
mixed
with
an
underlying
spiced
up
sweet
aroma
taste
is
sweet
and
tangy
shimmering
malt
and
fruit
tones
along
with
a
very
nice
dry
finish
completing
this
beer
mouthfeel
has
a
healthy
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
light
medium
bodied
beer
nice
full
body
from
the
darker
roasts
this
beer
works
very
well
for
my
tastes
and
dances
along
my
palate
drinkability
is
definitely
good
especially
for
a
flemish
brown
ale
just
the
high
abv
holds
it
back
from
becoming
a
true
session
beer
in
my
eyes
i
found
this
beer
to
have
decent
complexity
and
very
good
balance
this
was
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
i
would
say
this
would
make
a
nice
after
dinner
drink
for
me
notes
a
decent
flemish
brown
the
alcohol
sneaks
up
on
you
as
the
beer
is
slowly
sipped
away
a
sharp
cheddar
is
a
must
to
pair
with
this
beer
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
too
much
poured
a
brown
with
a
huge
amount
of
chunky
sediment
so
much
it
was
actually
a
little
disgusting
nose
was
yeasty
obviously
alchol
and
some
brown
sugar
taste
was
somewhat
malty
with
some
hops
and
definite
brown
sugar
also
nutty
medium
carbonation
very
warming
this
beer
definitely
has
few
redeeming
qualities
and
i
dont
plan
on
having
it
again
anytime
soon
enormous
frothy

of
dross
just
floating
around
the
aroma
of
peat
or
smoke
quite
pronounced

also
nice

a
treat
for
the

in

quite
dry

bitter
aftertaste
a
bit
of
a

warmer
at

and
a
pleasure
to
quaff
at
any

its
a
terrific
beer

for
sure

im
not

i
could
have
enjoyed
it
to
its
full
potential
because
it
was
a
really
hot
day
and
i
think
it
was
a
bit
to
strong
and
not
so
refreshing
notes
an
excellent
example
of
a
flemish
brown
ale
extremely
enjoyable
so
enjoyable
you
forget
that
its

an

with

notes
like

also
some

with

id
recommend
this
to
a
wine
drinker
as
an
avenue
into
the
beer
world
very
good
really
starting
to
dig
this
style

but
a
good
deal
less
intense
good
intro
bruin
imo
fully
enjoyable
diversion
from
the
norm
maybe
this
will
become
the
new
norm
this
beer
is
an
old
style
mash
beer
sour
taste
but
not
to
heavy
overall
the
most
sour
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
to
date
i
enjoyed
it
but
this
is
a
beer
i
would
only
drink
one
at
per
sitting
refreshing
like
a
sour
cranberry
and
vodka
from
12
oz
bottle
314
good
like
a
lot
early
sips
i
thought
it
wasnt
a
that
good
but
as
i
kept
drinking
it
felt
like
a
smooth
cranberry
sour
drink
smooth
and
enjoyable
i
need
to
try
again
early
in
my
session
to
really
appreciate
tangy
and
tart
but
with
an
undertone
of
sweetness
like
rodenbach
woody
notes
and
a
little
dark
fruit
dry
yeasty
finish
really
a
pleasant
sipping
brew
and
not
at
all
like
the
american
extreme
sour
style
on
tap
at
fathom
on
the
pier
on
shelter
island
san
diego
it
was
ok
but
not
my
favorite
i
had
two
others
in
similar
style
i
prefer
the
lighter
colored
flemish
ales
birthday
gift
from
garys
in
basking
ridge
i
expected
a
more
tart
beer
from
what
i
read
in
these
reviews
in
that
respect
i
was
disappointed
but
if
i
ignore
this
it
was
a
solid
beer
there
are
apple
cider
vinegar
notes
here
and
there
so
beware
of
that
otherwise
this
is
a
beer
if
grab
on
occasion
if
the
price
or
mood
is
right
wonderful
taste
of
cherries
and
smooth
finish
could
drink
this
forever
this
one
isnt
for
me
had
about
a
half
glass
and
dumped
the
rest
too
sour
kinda
nasty
o
i
really
like
this
one
very
well
done

was
curious
about
this
beer
and
id
definitely
order
it
again
subtlety
tart
and
fruity
its
a
nice
compliment
to
your
meal
for
the
style
this
beer
really
left
me
wanting
more
not
nearly
as
tart
and
funky
and
many
other
oud
bruins
ive
tried
i
suppose
its
a
great
starter
for
someone
not
as
adventurous
to
try
and
get
into
this
style
overall
very
tasty
our
bruin
some
of
the
cherry
syrup
aromas
had
me
worried
this
would
come
off
overly
sweet
but
this
plays
well
surprisingly
drinkable
a
nice
treat
a
different
beer
than
the
bellegems
as
far
as
i
can
tell
or
perhaps
this
is
an
older
vintage
pours
a
medium
amber
color
with
a
white
head
and
really
no
sediment
aroma
is
wine
like
with
sweet
and
sour
characteristics
this
brew
is
sweet
to
sour
with
toffee
and
tartness
rounding
out
the
flavor
profile
there
is
a
pleasant
malt
flavor
throughout
and
tartness
follows
the
beer
finishes
clean
and
mild
easily
drank
and
quite
enticing
would
certainly
recommend
this
beer
for
personal
use
or
to
share
with
a
special
someone
o
not
the
best
oud
bruin
but
a
good
starter
beer
for
people
not
used
to
sours
tasted
like
a
light
belgian
dubbel
that
was

tart

this
is
a
fine
beer
and
a
decent
example
of
an
oud
bruin
its
not
quite
sour
enough
and
theres
not
a
lot
of
complexity
however
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
maybe
a
good
intro
to
sours
if
you

it

2

o
the
oak
was
very
heavy
relatively
speaking
in
this
beer
and
took
away
from
the
overall
flavor
profile
for
me
the
classic
cherry
pie
flavor
was
there
with
good
complexity
but
the
balance
was
thrown
off
with
the
oak
that
being
said
i
would
get
this
beer
again
because
it
was
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
over
oaking
that
is
good
drinkable
different

a

quite

save
your

pilsners

my
preferred
all

beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
1182014
nice
reddish
copper
appearance
aroma
is
slightly
metallic
that
seems
a
bit
odd
taste
is
very
nice
up
front
with
a
tart
sourness
of
grapes
and
some
slight
cherry
but
peters
out
too
quickly
if
this
had
a
better
finish
like
the
cuvee
jacobins
this
would
be
an
awesome
beer
o
pretty
good
pretty
dry
fruity
but
not
sweet
bright
flares
jostling
the
palate
but
not
quite
refreshing
can
say
it
does
seem
to
ignite
the
appetite
really
well
balanced
sour
with
notes
of
spice
pepper
and
lot
of
cherry
raspberry
strawberry
sourness
is
nice
carbonation
is
a
little
heavy
kind
of
distracting
on
certain
sips
still
its
almost
up
with
jacobins
as
far
as
what
i
can
get
my
hands
on
in
this
same
category
of
beers
a
very
nice
sour
one
of
the
better
ones
i
can
think
of
and
well
worth
trying
for
fans
of
the
style
and
newcomers
alike
very
nice
balance
and
flavor
overall
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
springfall
personally
i
find
the
fruit
notes
far
to
prominent
for
summer
but
for
late
spring
and
all
throughout
fall
this
one
is
ideal
overall
a
disarmingly
spritely
oud
bruin
that
is
lighter
more
quenching
and
refreshing
than
richer
examples
i
get
the
impression
that
this
is
either
a
very
young
beer
or
chemically
synthesized
lactic
acid
has
been
introduced
it
lacks
the
charisma
of
better
examples
but
still
makes
for
an
interesting
glass
and
at
5
5
abv
this
would
be
great
bottle
to
bring
out
to
parties
picnics
etc
would
revisit
this
but
would
not
pay
much
for
it
just
read
on
the
label
that
it
is
actually
a
blend
of
brune
and
lambic
which
explains
a
lot
and
makes
me
appreciate
it
a
little
more
odd
product
poured
a
brownish
body
light
brown
muddy
brown
not
to
great
with
describing
the
color
with
decent
head
and
lace
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
has
some
sour
and
sweet
patches
intertwining
with
each
other
but
mostly
am
getting
some
dark
fruit
like
plums
and
figs
tastemouthfeel
more
of
the
same
as
light
to
medium
bodied
smooth
easy
to
drink
not
too
familiar
with
this
style
but
have
a
had
a
few
and
this
one
is
real
good
there
is
a
balance
and
mix
of
sweet
and
dark
fruits
with
a
spicy
edge
and
at
times
a
little
tartsour
cherry
flavor
really
not
much
to
say
except
this
is
really
good
oud
bruins
for
me
always
seem
classy
and
sophisticated
and
this
fits
the
bill
not
very
tart
or
sour
if
you
will
easy
drinker
taste
is
sweet
and
sour
dried
fruits
up
front
turned
and
slightly
vinegary
metal
hints
of
steak
sauce
and
tamarind
hint
of
wet
wood
with
some
toasty
bread
crust
in
the
finish
it
is
full
bodied
fairly
complex
lively
engaging
and
zesty
fairly
dry
with
a
light
leaning
to
the
sweet
and
sour
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
easy
drinking
sour
not
the
best
out
there
but
very
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
see
on
the
shelves
all
the
time
and
i
decided
to
buy
one
yesterday
similar
to
a
not
nearly
sour
cuvee
jacobins
nice
beer
that
would
be
a
great
foray
into
sours
for
someone
o
real
tasty
a
little
sweet
but
a
great
example
of
a
flemish
bier
a
very
cool
version
of
the
style
here
not
as
sour
as
many
of
them
its
a
blend
of
a
flemish
red
ale
and
a
young
lambic
giving
this
beer
a
rounded
flavor
and
tartness
without
the
caustic
acidity
of
other
oud
bruin
types
more
brown
than
red
on
the
pour
hazy
and
dense
with
a
deep
mahogany
glow
and
less
than
an
inch
of
cream
colored
foam
the
nose
is
fruity
as
they
come
tart
cherries
and
maybe
even
raisins
give
an
orchard
sort
of
sweetness
to
this
and
chocolate
and
dark
amber
malts
unite
in
a
rich
lathery
body
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
as
well
as
a
lactic
tartness
from
the
lambic
the
wheat
malt
there
doesnt
add
much
but
the
mild
acidity
is
a
nice
contrast
to
the
red
fruit
finish
complex
and
drinkable
more
so
than
a
lot
of
these
well
carbonated
but
i
notice
the
lushness
of
the
feel
before
the
bubbles
its
expanding
on
the
palate
and
creamy
too
down
easy
a
very
impressive
offering
especially
at
around
5
bucks
a
bottle
atmosphere
is
really
nice
great
head
yet
little
lacing
nose
is
woody
and
fruity
bready
with
a
little
fermented
fruit
crisp
fruity
with
a
little
body
wellbalanced
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
poured
from
an
11
2
oz
bottle
into
a
petrus
chalice
a
delicious
oud
bruin
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
body
and
a
longer
finish
but
its
still
heavenly
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
goudenband
or
duchesse
but
still
highly
recommended
had
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
it
pours
brown
with
a
tan
head
on
the
aroma
i
picked
up
the
lactic
sour
with
a
little
bit
of
vinegar
has
a
little
fruit
nose
to
it
not
that
noticeable
you
taste
the
sour
right
away
but
it
quickly
fades
it
has
a
distinct
malt
taste
at
the
back
of
the
palate
i
also
get
hints
of
cherries
it
is
definitely
medium
bodied
not
as
much
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
amazing
sour
it
is
not
expensive
and
very
palatable
bottom
line
if
you
like
sours
or
reds
must
buy
fruit
beer
loves
should
give
it
a
shot
too
its
not
all
that
expensive
either
so
it
might
be
a
good
transitory
beer
for
folks
not
used
to
the
style
or
sours
in
general
the
taste
is
very
good
with
semi
dry
malt
flavor
with
fruity
tangy
and
almost
soursweet
flavor
from
yeast
with
slight
malt
sweetness
with
a
light
raisiny
accent
and
mild
caramel
toward
the
middle
with
minimal
spice
in
the
finish
and
mild
alcohol
in
the
taste
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
an
oud
bruin
i
would
drink
this
again
without
hesitation
random
pick
off
the
shelf
this
week
pours
a
tan
less
than
average
head
about
25
on
the
srm
scale
nice
color
the
lace
stuck
to
the
side
of
the
glass
like
glue
very
impressive
the
label
claimed
aroma
of
cherry
and
raisins
honestly
i
didnt
pick
up
the
raisins
but
i
dont
have
the
best
trained
nose
earthy
and
tart
to
me
those
same
aromas
were
reflected
in
the
taste
i
like
sour
beers
so
i
may
be
partial
to
this
one
it
was
pretty
good
mouthfeel
was
smooth
lingering
tartness
that
makes
the
back
of
your
mouth
pucker
i
would
recommend
and
think
it
would
pair
well
with
grilled
pork
chops
o
the
label
on
this
beer
describes
everything
i
could
ever
say
about
it
two
guys
happily
smiling
toasting
with
simple
glasses
full
of
fizzy
beer
with
a
profile
thats
light
approachable
and
refreshing
this
sour
ale
is
the
epitome
of
a
nofrills
drinkable
delight
one
of
my
two
or
three
favorite
examples
of
this
classic
flemish
style
such
a
rounded
flavor
and
an
excellent
body
complex
yet
so
refreshing
you
could
guzzle
it
if
you
are
not
careful
overall
this
is
tasty
stuff
its
perhaps
a
little
bit
sweet
but
its
well
crafted
with
plenty
of
classic
characters
very
tasty
stuff
o
a
solid
sour
i
would
recommend
this
to
just
about
anyone
that
appreciates
a
highquality
sour
i
really
want
to
give
this
one
another
shot
i
am
tasting
it
as
i
write
this
review
and
i
can
tell
that
my
opinion
of
it
may
change
with
my
mood
or
state
of
my
palate
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
rubyamber
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
offwhite
ring
of
surface
head
nose
of
fruit
tart
with
a
blend
of
apple
cherry
and
raisin
with
an
earthy
undertone
flavors
are
tart
and
earthy
forward
providing
a
very
smooth
blend
of
flavors
tart
cherry
and
apple
lead
the
charge
with
an
earthy
and
woody
backbone
and
some
old
world
fruit
rich
and
sweet
to
follow
very
well
balanced
and
the
tart
flavors
are
in
the
spotlight
but
the
beer
remains
drinkable
and
dynamic
the
aftertaste
is
rich
and
tart
with
a
light
smooth
crisp
feel
and
a
slight
effervescence
into
the
finish
very
balanced
and
palatable
for
the
style
tasty
brew
gotta
be
the
only
place
in
the
area
i
can
get
this
stuff
on
tap
unless
firkin
wants
to
throw
me
for
a
loop
some
day
it
pours
a
deep
rubysienna
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
spicy
red
wine
grapes
im
thinking
a
particularly
peppery
tempranillo
here
rich
caramel
a
hint
of
graham
cracker
light
plum
mild
black
cherry
and
a
feathers
touch
of
red
wine
vinegar
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
whatever
tartness
was
present
before
has
been
sanded
down
to
a
strong
occasional
stab
adrift
in
a
sea
of
sweet
malts
mild
peppery
spices
and
oxidized
sherry
the
blend
though
seems
to
work
leading
to
a
pleasant
easygoing
drink
that
may
have
been
less
likely
had
the
tartness
retained
its
former
strength
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slickish
feel
overall
a
nice
bruin
something
that
doesnt
wow
or
overwhelm
but
something
that
delivers
some
interesting
and
unique
flavor
combinations
and
an
enjoyable
time
oi
am
pretty
disappointed
in
this
beer
complexity
is
lacking
and
i
could
not
get
over
the
oxidized
saccharine
flavors
perhaps
i
got
an
old
bottle
on
the
plus
side
it
is
pretty
goodlooking
for
the
style
and
the
feel
is
wellsuited
for
the
style
too
disappointingly
bland
i
had
higher
expectations
having
enjoyed
cuvee
des
jacobins
i
didnt
get
much
tart
or
sour
taste
out
of
this
fairly
refreshing
on
this
hot
day
so
i
cant
complain
entirely
but
id
definitely
rather
be
drinking
something
else
750

that

to

is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a

this
is
an

flanders
brown

all
around
nice

just
a

full
smooth

black

more

notes
and
some
very
light

some

is
perceptible
underneath
medium
bodied
and
tart
good
stuff
and
i
love
the
laurel
and
hardy
characters
on
the
front
label
this
is
a
sophisticated
beer
suitable
for
conversation
with
friends
despite
strong
sourness
and
flavor
in
the
aroma
the
various
interrelationships
within
this
beer
are
quite
delicate
warmth
brings
out
a
contemplative
character
o
a
very
good
mild
sour
not
near
as
tart
as
others
and
for
that
reason
this
ale
could
be
recommended
to
folks
who
do
not
like
extremely
tart
sours
this
was
a
gift
so
im
not
sure
of
the
price
but
i
would
likely
buy
this
in
replace
of
other
belgian
flanders
o
my
first
flanders
ale
i
have
mixed
feelings
on
this
one
on
one
side
its
better
than
i
expected
on
the
other
its
like
drinking
sour
wine
pair
this
beer
with
bbq
or
some
mexican
street
tacos
with
extra
grease
cilantro
onion
and
jalapeño
and
if
your
feeling
especially
adventurous
pair
this
beer
with
vanilla
bean
ice
cream
and
boysenberry
pie
a
nice
beer
my
500th
review
too
o
a
superior
example
of
a
bruin
very
much
a
drinkable
beer
very
enjoyable
and
a
great
sipper
overall
i
dig
very
refreshing
with
good
fruit
flavors
their
is
good
tartness
to
it
that
doesnt
yell
at
you
at
ever
sip
but
move
it
across
the
palate
and
it
shows
up
very
enjoyable
beer
final
thoughts
ive
only
had
a
handful
of
sour
ales
but
bellegems
bruin
will
definitely
stick
out
in
my
mind
as
one
of
the
most
drinkerfriendly
while
its
not
quite
as
tart
as
i
had
hoped
for
its
smooth
and
mellow
nature
makes
up
for
that
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
especially
if
sharing
with
someone
who
is
curious
to
try
the
style
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
t
really
well
made
the
sweetness
and
tartness
are
very
well
balanced
leaving
a
beer
that
sour
and
nonsour
fans
alike
should
really
like
a
nice
mix
of
red
grapes
slightly
tart
cherries
velvety
smooth
malt
red
and
green
apple
and
some
raisin
tart
but
not
overly
sour
very
nice
overall
like
a
wild
ale
i
would
love
to
try
more
of
this
style
one
of
my
favorite
beers
o
nothing
offensive
here
and
nothing
spectacular
conservative
flavor
and
aroma
that
didnt
do
much
for
me
mouthfeel
is
light
but
slightly
filmy
overall
im
sold
on
bockor
beers
at
this
point
i
like
this
a
lot
m
beautiful
i
think
the
age
has
eliminated
some
of
the
carbonation
but
beautiful
feel
id
really
like
to
see
how
this
is
fresh
described
as
a
blend
of
a
brown
ale
an
18
month
old
lambic
a
nice
refreshing
sour
good
carbonation
and
assertive
tartness
at
first
but
then
drops
off
quickly
thin
mouthfeel
leaves
you
wanting
more
successive
sips
build
the
mouthfeel
nice
almost
sour
cherry
taste
without
being
mediciny
at
all
a
bit
pricey
but
a
very
nice
flanders
brown
i
will
buy
this
again
but
probably
for
special
occasions
will
buy
again
drinkability
is
phenomenal
this
is
a
close
to
perfect
as
it
gets
a
benchmark
example
of
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
dark
candy
brown
with
a
lovely
creamy
white
head
that
sits
at
a
fingers
width
above
the
beer
in
the
light
and
in
the
glass
though
the
beer
is
beautifully
dark
ruby
in
color
with
some
slight
muddling
in
the
color
to
suggest
brown
maple
syrup
lacing
is
thin
and
tendril
like
along
the
walls
of
the
glass
the
body
appears
to
be
clean
and
free
of
particles
but
is
really
quite
opaque
to
the
eye
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
strongly
of
cherry
leather
and
funk
with
big
fruity
waftings
and
a
light
barnyard
funk
lying
beneath
everything
that
just
barely
touches
upon
less
appealing
smells
the
smell
actually
begins
with
a
nice
malty
base
but
that
is
swiftly
washed
away
by
the
funk
and
fruit
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
tart
with
wonderfully
fruity
notes
that
move
mostly
in
the
tart
cherry
range
but
do
hint
slightly
at
other
fruits
the
funk
detected
in
the
nose
is
lighter
in
the
taste
but
still
present
in
the
background
of
flavor
the
beer
begins
with
light
funk
before
quickly
opening
into
sweet
fruity
cherry
notes
with
some
mild
leather
to
suggest
the
funkier
side
of
the
beer
the
finish
mingles
light
funk
and
fruit
beautifully
and
the
aftertaste
rings
with
a
surprisingly
salty
sour
funk
while
still
hinting
at
the
cool
fruity
cherry
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
light
to
medium
in
body
with
some
fierce
prickling
from
the
carbonation
though
it
remains
smooth
other
than
that
the
mouth
is
left
neutral
with
only
the
slightest
watering
at
the
sides
of
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
lovely
light
wild
beer
it
tends
more
towards
the
fruity
side
of
the
road
but
suggests
some
nice
funk
notes
while
still
holding
onto
the
fruit
the
beer
is
a
terrific
introduction
beer
for
wild
ales
and
a
nice
fruity
beverage
overall
i
like
this
beer
overall
a
very
sessionable
flanders
that
i
wish
i
could
have
every
day
doesnt
blow
you
away
but
is
still
a
good
representation
of
the
style
o
i
love
how
this
tastes
but
its
the
mouthfeel
that
dominates
i
enjoyed
this
a
ton
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
belgian
goblet
batch
01
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
small
but
bubbly
head
the
nose
is
tart
and
funky
a
little
cherry
maybe
brett
and
some
vinegar
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
pretty
good
about
dutchess
level
quality
you
get
a
nice
tart
load
of
fruity
malts
nice
i
like
this
but
dont
love
it
i
really
appreciate
the
light
flavors
and
fruitiness
in
this
beer
but
i
want
a
contrast
it
needs
some
more
roastiness
or
earthiness
give
this
a
little
more
complexity
and
id
love
it
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
for
someone
new
to
sours
its
not
too
intense
but
anyone
can
taste
the
quality
it
is
balanced
interesting
tasty
and
refreshing
i
would
love
to
see
this
beer
in
the
bottle
conditioned
form
considering
the
classics
of
this
style
contain
yeast
great
price
of

99
a
bottle
cant
go
wrong
i
will
be
buying
more
in
the
near
future
pours
the
color
of
molasses
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
meager
head
that
is
soon
nonexistent
tartness
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
which
smells
of
weak
apple
cider
vinegar
i
actually
wish
it
was
a
bit
bolder
as
is
its
just
ok
the
sourness
is
immediately
present
on
the
front
end
though
it
is
not
terribly
strong
in
and
of
itself
there
simply
isnt
much
else
present
for
it
to
contest
with
outside
of
the
carbonation
and
some
mild
yeastiness
some
malt
sweetness
finally
makes
its
way
through
in
the
finish
well
after
the
tartness
has
subsided
grapefruit
and
apple
notes
lurk
somewhere
in
the
transition
between
the
two
all
in
all
this
is
a
fairly
mild
and
drinkable
bruin
that
doesnt
stand
out
in
any
particular
aspect
it
reminds
me
mostly
of
a
flanders
red
assuming
these
styles
are
almost
the
same
oh
flanders
ales
how
i
just
dont
get
enough
of
you
this
beer
is
pretty
straight
forward
and
direct
i
mean
that
in
as
good
a
way
as
possible
it
doesnt
really
step
out
and
try
to
be
anything
beyond
a
good
beer
straight
forward
fits
to
style
i
like
it
but
it
is
pretty
pure
to
the
style
parameters
which
might
be
a
lot
for
some
people
to
deal
with
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
really
nails
the
sweetness
right
not
overdone
or
underdeveloped
lightbodied
and
easy
to
drink
the
sourness
is
tamed
back
and
the
intensity
of
the
cherries
is
perfect
the
carbonation
is
neither
apparent
nor
bothersome
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
lambicoud
bruin
style
ales
but
this
is
rather
intriguing
i
doubt
this
will
become
a
regular
style
of
beer
that
i
partake
in
but
for
something
tasty
and
different
this
seems
well
worth
it
overall
a
pretty
solid
flanders
oud
bruin
sourness
isnt
overdone
pleasing
beer
traditionally
meant
as
thirst
quencher
fresh
and
drinkable
decent
example
of
the
style
flavor
is
a
little
lighter
and
less
sweet
than
a
duchesse
jammy
tart
fruit
with
plenty
of
caramel
maltiness
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
sourness
but
overall
it
is
pretty
good
i
am
always
down
for
a
good
flanders
and
while
this
one
is
not
great
itll
scratch
that
itch
poured
into
a
chalice
pours
dark
brown
with
a
finger
length
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
sour
apples
sweet
cherries
and
yeast
the
taste
is
tart
with
flavors
of
apple
cherry
and
mildly
sweet
roasted
malts
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer

really
nice
and
well
balanced
sour
brown
maybe
a
bit
more
complexity
would
rate
it
higher
for
me
o
pretty
good
but
i
was
expecting
just
a
tad
more
flavor
overall
a
very
nice
oud
bruin
on
the
tart
side
but
relatively
balanced
with
sweetness
i
like
it
dark
reddish
brown
with
scarlet
edges
and
a
beige
head
smells
tart
but
also
like
roasted
sugar
the
taste
is
fabulous

with
this
amazing

of

excellent
version
of
a
classic
style
ive
never
heard
of
the
brewer
the
label
is
a
bit
generic
but
the
beer
is
high
quality
bellegems
bruin

flanders
ale
mouthfeel
has
a
dry
finish
with

balance
to
make
everybody
happy
even
sturdy
flowing
carbonation
a
bit
effervescent
and
bubbly
like
overall
high
drinkable
and
enjoyable
version
of
a
hard
to
find
style
glad
i
picked
it
up
definitely
worth
it
at
around
4
bucks
a
bottle
low
b
overall
a
nice
but
mild
oude
bruin
w
good
flavor
this
is
a
perfect
starter
sour
for
anyone
trying
to
ease
into
the
sour
categories
this
beer
is
no
cuvee
des
jacobins
but
i
would
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
another
nice
job
from
bockor
d
decent
but
a
bit
of
a
letdown
especially
when
their
cuvee
de
jacobins
is
top
notch
ajr
this
beer
pours
out
a
deep
red
color
with
a
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
tart
and
sour
with
cherries
and
vinegar
being
the
dominant
aromas
the
taste
is
pretty
strong
on
the
cherries
at
the
start
and
the
finish
with
some
of
the
sour
and
vinegar
notes
coming
in
in
the
midpoint
to
linger
just
a
little
into
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
my
first
flanders
oud
bruin
and
i
cant
help
but
feel
its
a
good
but
not
outstanding
representation
of
the
style
im
more
than
willing
to
find
out
if
my
hunch
is
accurate
fun
looking
bottle
but
cant
quite
hang
out
with
the
upper
class
of
this
style
o
this
is
a
good
beer
ive
never
had
a
beer
in
this
style
before
and
it
was
a
great
first
example
pours
a
slightly
murky
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
tart
and
sour
cherries
slight
vinegar
and
slight
funk
there
is
a
slight
grape
aroma
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
of
the
cherries
up
front
with
some
slight
vinegar
flavors
but
the
taste
is
only
mildly
tart
and
funky
there
is
a
grapelike
aftertaste
on
this
one
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
fruity
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
overall
if
its
still
around
at
that
bar
i
will
have
to
pick
up
another
a
great
flanders
ale
brewed
with
cherries
also
a
very
affordable
one
at
4
50
a
pop
try
it
if
you
find
it
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
what
i
appreciate
most
about
this
is
its
delicious
contrast
to
what
i
enjoy
most
often
hoppy
and
citric
american
ales
worth
picking
up
a
loose
bottle
or
having
a
glass
nearly
clear
mahogany
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
immediately
almost
no
lacing
fruity
aroma
and
taste
berries
and
cherries
lightly
tart
and
acidic
subtle
vinegar
just
a
bit
puckering
in
the
finish
medium
light
bodied
with
solid
carbonation
clean
and
crisp
easy
drinking
tasty
but
not
exactly
outstanding
or
particularly
memorable
for
the
style
sourness
and
funk
are
very
restrained
unintimidating
decent
needs
better
balance
was
hoping
this
would
be
as
impressive
as
the
jacobins
rouge
but
this
one
left
me
disappointed
this
is
a
reddish
brown
beer
after
a
fizzy
head
the
beer
lacks
foam
although
its
very
carbonated
the
aroma
is
great
funky
fresh
apple
peal
sweet
amber
malt
apricot
and
sour
cherry
the
taste
is
initially
tart
followed
by
a
little
sweetness
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
its
fruity
flavorful
and
lightly
spritzy
not
as
sour
as
expected
its
a
relatively
balanced
beer
medium
to
light
in
body
very
carbonated
nice
recommended
first
time
i
saw
it
in
pgh
at
the
recently
opened
99
bottles
in
carnegie
twp
and
i
picked
one
up
to
try
it
out
will
be
back
for
more
pour
a
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
it
smells
of
sweet
tarts
in
the
taste
sour
dark
cherries
the
taste
grows
with
time
a
small
sour
bite
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
sour
cherry
in
the
aftertaste
sour
cherries
all
day
but
not
overly
acidic
d
very
nice
and
drinkable
with
a
sweeter
than
average
character
that
would
make
it
a
good
introduction
to
sour
beers
it
has
the
classic
sweet
and
sour
profile
with
little
funk
and
a
nicely
balanced
finish
o
very
good
drinkability
and
a
great
representative
of
the
style
great
flavors
but
not
overpowering
making
it
quite
approachable
o
i
m
obviously
not
a
sour
enthusiast
i
cant
describe
very
well
the
taste
of
this
new
to
sours
but
i
love
it
forgive
me
o
very
nice
pretty
good
drinkability
as
well
not
really
familiar
with
this
style
but
i
would
get
it
again
for
sure
excellent
flanders
oud
bruin
very
subdued
but
full
of
good
flavor
a
nice
entry
to
the
style
and
also
a
nice
one
for
those
familiar
who
prefer
less
puckering
offerings
overall
good
beer
i
am
still
just
getting
into
this
style
and
am
liking
my
journey
so
far
i
would
get
this
again
seems
like
this
is
a
good
style
for
summer
or
winter
when
you
want
something
different
45
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
tight
one
finger
slightly
off
white
head
which
stays
around
for
most
of
the
drink
there
is
also
sticky
gobs
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
grapes
and
vinegar
the
aroma
is
well
rounded
and
very
inviting
the
taste
starts
with
a
vinager
tartness
and
gives
way
to
a
grape
and
slight
tart
cherry
taste
the
backend
has
a
malt
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
acidic
overall
a
very
solid
beer
nice
sour
taste
and
aroma
mnice
mouthfeel
light
feeling
and
great
carbonation
overall
this
is
damn
good
again
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
the
style
but
really
hits
the
sweet
spot
with
the
tartness
definitely
have
it
again
d
probably
on
the
lighter
side
of
sour
for
the
style
but
i
enjoy
it
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
pancakes
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
brownish
red
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
head
settles
and
leaves
a
a
light
amount
of
scattered
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
tart
and
wooden
smelling
there
is
also
some
cherry
im
picking
up
also
the
taste
is
actually
much
better
than
i
expected
its
a
much
more
muted
sour
that
some
of
the
flanders
reds
out
there
the
mouthfeel
was
lightly
carbonated
and
pretty
smooth
overall
it
was
a
pretty
tasty
brew
even
though
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
the
sour
notes
are
right
there
when
it
first
hits
the
pallate
and
stays
throughout
i
can
taste
raisins
and
some
subtle
dark
fruit
that
i
cant
quite
pull
good
if
you
like
sours
but
i
do
not
so
just
so
so
for
me
i
was
surprised
with
this
beer
it
was
my
first
of
a
style
i
didnt
suppose
id
like
but
it
was
good
aroma
is
dark
fruits
ripe
plums
figs
pears
anything
dark
is
a
winner
here
really
just
nicely
done
sweet
with
raisins
and
touches
of
spice
coming
into
the
fold
beyond
well
put
together
each
sip
is
like
thanksgiving
dinner
with
the
flavors
a
tremendous
range
here
with
huge
swings
from
sugary
dark
fruits
to
light
spice
and
hints
of
tart
cherries
o
b
i
wish
there
was
more
funk
and
tart
but
solid
brew
a
real
quality
flemish
sour
very
good
aromatics
with
even
better
flavors
excellent
feel
and
a
real
good
beer
overall
notes
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
wish
there
were
more
availability
of
this
excellent
style
o
at
3
50
a
bottle
this
may
just
be
my
goto
fruited
sour
while
its
not
quite
marron
acidifie
or
oerbier
the
price
to
performance
ratio
is
staggering
a
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
lighter
sour
style
i
would
suggest
this
as
a
great
beer
vs
wine
pairing
as
it
can
easilly
outdo
most
red
wines
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
because
the
sourness
isnt
that
strong
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
i
will
be
looking
to
buy
more
asap
served
in
a
tulip
this
beer
had
a
brownishred
color
with
a
thin
head
enjoyable
sour
aroma
always
the
first
hint
that
ill
enjoy
this
style
of
brew
taste
was
consistent
with
the
nose
a
pleasant
tart
sensation
without
being
overwhelmingly
sour
a
touch
of
fruitiness
and
really
no
sense
of
bitterness
you
have
to
enjoy
the
sour
flavor
to
enjoy
this
mouthfeel
which
thankfully
i
do
not
a
style
i
pick
up
too
often
but
when
i
do
i
enjoy
it
and
this
is
a
good
example
one
finger
light
tan
head
quick
dissipation
with
minimal
retention
mahogany
copper
clear
body
fairly
dark
no
visible
carbonation
a
bit
of
barnyard
funk
in
the
nose
balanced
with
dark
stonefruit
esters
plums
a
bit
of
floral
hops
and
a
healthy
dose
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
taste
mirrors
nose
but
the
blending
leads
me
to
believe
this
is
far
more
lager
than
lambic
not
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
but
certainly
a
good
idea
from
a
business
perspective
mild
tartness
and
even
milder
sourness
due
to
caramel
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
low
effervescence
a
bit
of
stickiness
this
take
on
west
flanders
beers
is
different
from
what
im
used
to
so
i
will
try
others
within
this
style
but
not
sure
this
made
a
big
enough
impression
where
id
choose
this
again
overall
its
really
good
much
better
than
a
b
o
this
beer
is
a
nice
classic
flanders
red
with
some
soft
depth
of
other
flavors
like
a
nice
blended
brown
malt
and
a
good
amount
of
tartness
whether
you
like
oud
bruins
or
are
just
interested
this
is
an
ideal
introduction
to
the
style
i
recommend

are
both
pretty

theres
also
the

at

definitely
buy
this
again
overall
good
dark

when
held
to

some

in
the
taste
some
light
cherry
tartness
a
little
maltiness
underneath
not
much
sweetness
at
all
seems
like
a
return
to
a
more
traditional
recipe
possibly
renamed
after
the
bockor

founder
from
the
11
2
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
may
2
2011
the
pour
is
dark
ruby
red
to
brown
with
little
to
no
head
the
aroma
exhibits
characteristics
of
champagne
vinegar
and
overripe
fruit
the
body
is
thin
to
medium
as
the
style
should
be
the
taste
was
full
of
tart
fruit
akin
to
cherry
or
melon
a
slight
malt
character
lingers
might
be
my
favorite
of
the
style
very
decent
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
would
have
it
again
o
pretty
quintessential
if
anything
its
a
very
drinkable
inoffensive
bruin
some
in
this
style
clock
in
at
very
funky
or
sour
but
this
is
a
pretty
great
balance
sure
its
tangy
but
not
unpleasantly
so
very
well
executed
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
oud
bruin
the
aroma
is
fantastic
and
the
flavor
is
quite
good
although
not
quite
as
complex
as
the
aroma
and
it
finishes
a
bit
sweet
the
mouthfeel
throws
me
a
little
because
its
a
bit
thin
but
on
the
whole
its
a
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
bruin
kris
pours
a
very
deep
red
with
a
nice
big
well
retained
head
the
aroma
is
very
interesting
plenty
of
wet
grain
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
there
is
certainly
some
hay
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
similarly
earthy
however
this
is
no
where
near
as
sweet
as
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
nor
was
it
as
sweet
as
the
monks
cafe
i
just
drank
before
it
this
beer
isnt
particularly
bracingly
sour
but
it
is
certainly
tart
the
tartness
is
most
defiantly
the
dominant
character
of
the
beer
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
sour
cherry
in
there
as
well
but
the
beer
is
certainly
malty
in
a
sort
of
dusty
earthy
and
cocoa
kind
of
way
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
bottle
received
in
a
trade
with
brewerdan
thanks
nice
brown
color
and
at
first
a
big
head
then
a
wispy
ring
of
bubbles
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
decent
sweet
sour
almost
glue
vinegar
oud
bruin
for
sure
the
taste
starts
out
matching
the
smell
but
the
back
end
has
a
strange
graininess
to
it
that
i
cant
get
past
taste
is
very
nice
a
very
balanced
mixture
of
flavours
not
too
sour
not
too
malty
very
mild
and
highly
drinkable
this
would
be
a
good
sour
for
those
who
dont
like
sours
notes
i
was
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
had
ordered
it
by
chamce
with
no
research
prior
i
was
satisfied
and
i
would
order
this
again
and
again
d
decent

sour
as
i
said
one
dimensional

whole

final
word
it
tastes
good

try
with
this
style
and
surprisingly

to
juggle
crisp

glad
to
finally
try
it
at

after
seeing
it
in
my
old
dusty
michael

tomes
of
yore
o
highly
drinkable
well
balanced
not
too
tart
or
sweet
with
the
dark

flavors
that
i
love
the
most
satisfying
sour
ale
ive
had
so
far
had
a
chalice
at
the
blue
nile
thanks
to
al
for
bringing
in
the
sours
id
say
this
is
on
the
more
drinkable
end
o
the
spectrum
for
the
style
of
course
it
also
lacks
some
of
the
deeper
complexity
of
the
style
you
might
find
in
goudenband
but
is
still
a
step
ahead
of
petrus

theres
a
sweet
lightly
fruity
caramel

light
cocoa
malt
flavor
with
tart
candy
bite
at

finish
i
was
eating
a
plate
of
spicy
beef
sambussas
and
this
beer
went
surprisingly
well
with
the
fat
and
spice
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
smooth
i
hardly
noticed
it
go
down
but
it
did
have
a
nice
aftertaste
that
made
sure
i
remembered
the
experience
t
very
sweet
slightly
tangy
slight
geuzelike
funk

this
is
worth
drinking
again
the
palate
opens
with
a
pleasant
tartness
thats
a
blend
of
lactic
and
acetic
in
nature
the
tartness
is
moderately
fruity
as
well
with
some
dark
cherries
very
clean
the
complexity
of
the
nose
follows
the
opening
flavors
with
a
blend
of
cola
oakderived
vanilla
and
dark
brown
sugar
drying
on
the
finish
with
some
tannins
lactic
sourness
and
a
little
balsalmic
vinegar
this
beer
also
has
characteristics
of
oxidized
malt
with
a
little
must
the
cocoa
i
picked
out
on
the
nose
isnt
really
noticeable
not
unlike
some
of
the
flemish
oude
bruins
ive
had
this
has
a
mildly
meaty
salty
gamey
character
as
well
i
distinctly
remember
the
ichtegems
bruin
having
this
characteristic
but
its
very
enjoyable
unlike
in
some
other
cases
medium

with
moderate

this
beer
has
an
enjoyable
finish
a
little

i
really
like
this
still

not
extremely
refreshing
as
the

slightly
artificial
and
yet
also
flatish
coz
its
expired

months
i
cant
help
thinking
if
the
expiry
issue
really
has
something
to
do
with
the
underperformance
of
this
bottle
but
if
not
i
would
have
to
say
this
thinish
beer
is
at
best
a
mediocre
example
of
the
classic
style
i
might
have
to
try
the
tap
version
to
change
my
mind
or
find
a
bottle
within
the
bb

very

i
just
love
this
beer
and
i
hope
i
can
find
it
again
out
side
of
belgium
d
nice
flanders
bruin
with
decent
complexity
smoothness
and
easy

abv
not
my
normal
style
but
one
that
could
grow
on
you
for
not
its
a
one
and
out
drink
that
i
work
to
appreciate
as
i
expand
my
palate
bellegems
bruin
is
my
second
flanders
oud
bruin
and
i
like
it
just
fine
i
see
some
room
for
improvement
though
given
the
basic
elements
of
the
style
im
certain
theres
a
version
out
there
that
will
blow
me
away
i
just
need
to
find
it
this
wasnt
it
but
i
still
could
have
used
a
bigger
bottle
teasing
aromas
of
sweetly
caramelish
malt
and
a
sour
cherrylike
fruitiness
greet
you
in
the
nose
of
this
beautiful
oud
bruin
as
it
crosses
your
lips
and
tongue
you
find
its
quite
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
with
an
exceptionally
finebubbled
natural
carbonation
and
medium
body
the
flavor
however
is
distracting
with
its
beautiful
juxtaposition
of
sour
applemild
citruslike
tartness
and
lightly
sweet
caramelish
and
toasty
malt
raisins
and
brown
sugar
appear
along
the
way
and
a
thin
spritz
of
lemon
juice
hits
you
at
the
finish
drying
it
nicely
it
lingers
in
the
mouth
though
with
a
film
of
dry
maltiness
that
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
quite
nice
and
although
its
not
complex
the
combination
of
the
sourness
and
sweetness
is
interesting
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
this
is
a
superb
rendition
of
the
style
that
doesnt
rely
on
added
sweetness
to
overcome
its
sourness
and
isnt
too

this

from

club
and
the

was

i
thought
i
had
finished
all
of
my
bottles
of
this
beer
off
a
year
ago
i
seem
to
remember
it
tasting
better
than
this
foamy
head
that
died
quickly
kind
of
a
sour
smell
kind
of
tastes
like
a
burgundy
wine
maybe
this
one
has
sat
too
long
the
date
on
the
bottle
is
122002
and
today
is
81504
so
its
quite
possible
that
this
beer
has
not
improved
with
age
i
will
have
to
pick
up
another
bottle
sometime
and
edit
htis
review
if
my
impressions
change
i
love
the
way
a
good
flemish
ale
looks
this
is
ruby
brown
in
color
though
it
does
not
have
much
head
there
is
no
hop
aroma
to
speak
the
aroma
is
not
much
but
you
can
tell
that
it
is
sweet
and
tart
it
tastes
fruity
and
winey
and
is
acidic
and
sour
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
i
guess
i
just
poured
it
bad
i
will
have
to
say
that
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
beer
it
poured
nice
and
dark
brown
but
had
almost
know
head
at
all
very
little
carbonation
at
all
it
has
a
nice
aroma
that
is
malty
and
smells
of
plums
but
the
taste
was
extremely
sweet
it
had
a
big
plum
taste
with
very
little
bitterness
at
all
the
big
turn
off
was
the
residual
sweetness
which
overpowered
everything
else
overall
i
think
that
it
may
have
not
have
finished
fermenting
but
otherwise
was
interesting
this
brown
has
an
absolutely
exceptional
aroma
its
complex
fruity
sourness
is
interesting
and
refreshing
and
evolves
nicely
as
it
warms
its
refreshing
fruity
and
complexly
delicious
and
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more

certainly
quite
a

introduction
to

are

knocking
around
these
days
and
this
offering
whilst
not
the
best
is
a
good
example
worth
seeking
out
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
redbrown
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
it
has
a
slightly
malty
somewhat
citrusy
smell
that
gives
the
perception
of
sweet

sour
the
taste
was
of
a
sweet
flowery
front
diminishing
sour
mid
with
a
dry
slightly
yogurty
end
and
a
slightly

overall
it
was

sour
type
beer
which
i
really
wish
i
could
drink
on
a
more
regular
basis
source

beers

the
beer

pleasing
to
the

and
refreshed
my

booze
its
here
but
like
the
hops
youll
never
notice
it
i
havent
had
much
in
the
way
of
beers
from
flanders
or
in
a
flanders
oud
bruin
style
but
this
was
much
easier
than
i
was
led
to
have
guessed
and
proof
that
more
breweries
should
give
something
like
this
a
go
the
subtle
complexity
made
me
want
more
and
if
it
was
just
a
tad
less
potent
this
would
make
for
a
fabulous
session

tamer
with
fruit
plums

and
malt

no
chocolate

roast
and
just
a

with

and
low
medium
carbonation
a
little
steep
i
think
at

pretty
cool
beer
here
is

its

middle
this
is
interesting

caramel
realm
for
dark
ripe
fruit
apple
and
bread
pudding
the
flavor
matches
the
nose
with
moderate
acidity
balanced
out
by
dried
fruity
sweetness
cherry
and
raisin
come
to
mind
brown
sugar
lemon
the
sweetness
and
the
vinegar
are
weird
and
i
am
glad
i
am
sharing
the
bottle
but
the
beer
does
appear
to
be
quite
traditional
have
not
seen
this
in
out
market
here
until
recently
more
body
than
the
style
calls
for
makes
it
linger
a
little
too
long
and
lose
some
of
its
refreshing
qualities
but
its
mature
beer
far
out
and
tasty
on
the
whole
especially
if
you
like
the
traditional
belgian
sour
red
types
lots
and
lots
of
barrel
here
if
thats
your
thing
nice
but
would
be
better
if
it
was
more
sour
tangy
tastes
a
little
like
a
cross
between
a
beer
and
a
wine
expected
this
to
be
a
bit
more
sour
not
to
my
taste
a
little
too
sweet
and
woody
for
me
with
the
taste
of
the
barrel
o
its
got
some
nice
flavors
but
too
sweet
it
could
have
used
a
little
bit
more
sharpness
to
finish
it
somewhat
lacks
the
complexity
of
other
oud
bruins
o
not
as
sour
as
some
others
i
have
tried
or
are
my
taste
buds
adjusting
but
very
tasty
and
well
done
a
little
too
syrupy
its
similar
to
rodenbach
o
a
flavorful
beer
a
little
too
heavily
balanced
toward
the
sweetness
for
me
to
love
it
good
but
fairly
unremarkable
especially
for
a
style
that
tends
toward
complexity
overall
very
good
grand
cru
with
intriguing
flavors
nice
warm
buzz
from

definitely

cherrys
what
i
first
said
then
i
read
sour
apple
on
here
ill
stick
with
the
former
pronounced
forward
anything
but
shy
like
a
tart
dubbel
the
yeast
and
malt
are
prominent
this
is
as
close
as
ill
get
to
enjoying
a
sour
i
cant
ever
really
pick
up
the
alcohol
with
sours
either
will
definitely
be
drinking
this
one
again
this
was
a
pretty
good
oud
bruin
its
probably
a
little
sweeter
than
typical
but
thats
ok
with
me
mild
tartness
greets
the
palate
along
with
brown
sugar
port
and
vinegar
sherry
notes
from
oxidation
along
with
a
nice
cherry
flavor
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
tart
mineral
finish
musty
oak
faint
herb
and
grass
but
moreso
a
pretty
solid
oud
bruin
ale
cocoa
like
malt
underneath
a
light
tartness
overall
pretty
good
beer
here
id
reach
for
this
again
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
belgian
style
flemish
red
ale
matured
in
oak
barrels
o
great
beer
will
have
again
the
sourness
is
relatively
mild
and
the
flavor
is
not
as
heavy
as
others
in
the
style
i
will
still
have
it
again
the
beer
had
a
tart
wine
like
aroma
very
little
head
on
the
pour
almost
none
dark
red
in
color
the
beer
starts
with
a
fruity
plum
maybe
tartness
and
ends
with
a
hint
of
the
oak
there
is
a
malt
backbone
from
start
to
finish
the
tartness
is
really
carried
by
the
carbonation
the
bubbles
have
a
very
fine
feel
in
the
mouth
o
apart
from
the
surprise
explosion
the
beer
is
good
slightly
less
depth
than
others
in
the
style
explosive
carbonation
is
a
drawback
overall
pretty
good
there
are
better
flemish
beers
out
there
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
beer
in
general
and
cheap
compared
to
some
others
very
bland
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
ive
had
quite
a
few
sours
now
of
various
styles
including
flanders
flemish
reds
browns
etc
this
one
didnt
have
much
flavor
to
speak
of
no
tartness
not
very
sour
sort
of
like
a
flat
soda
without
the
sweetness
i
actually
only
got
through
about
13
of
my
tulip
and
i
laid
it
on
the
arm
of
my
couch
and
it
actually
spilled
over
on
top
of
me
and
my
couch
cushions
and
i
didnt
feel
too
bad
about
it
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
o
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
good
flavor
and
tastes
like
it
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
make
smooth
succulent
and
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
mahogany
with
a
medium
tan
head
with
impressive
lacing
aromas
of
vinegar
and
super
ripe
fruit
taste
begins
with
some
super
tart
cherry
followed
by
a
hint
of
grain
then
some
woody
mouth
puckering
sour
finish
mouthfeel
is
rich
overall
a
nice
sour
beer
overall
a
solid
example
of
a
flemish
red
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
the
body
is
light
a
fairly
robust
red
wine
with
a
light
fizz
to
it
its
got
a
solid
depth
to
it
and
flows
very
nicely
it
has
a
pretty
easy
finish
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
aroma
and
the
mouthfeel
there
is
big
perfume
funk
and
sweetness
from
the
aroma
hitting
most
of
the
necessary
notes
quite
nicely
the
taste
however
was
a
bit
curious
as
none
of
the
tartness
or
substantial
oak
lingers
through
the
sip
it
hits
hard
at
the
front
of
your
teeth
but
is
all
but
indiscernible
through
the
end
and
aftertaste
where
basic
cooked
brown
maltiness
predominates
this
is
partially
rectified
by
the
soft
creamy
slurp
of
the
feel
in
conclusions
we
did
not
feel
that
our
bottle
was
infected
this
beer
marks
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
lacked
enough
jazz
or
cohesion
to
pull
it
to
the
next
level
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
was
happy
to
find
another
example
i
had
never
tried
before
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
lactic
notes
kind
of
spoil
it
for
me
there
are
far
better
examples
out
there
o
not
an
outstanding
flanders
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
conservative
without
being
weak
and
probably
a
good
gateway
to
more
extreme
examples
of
the
style
not
a
bad
sour
but
i
believe
id
reach
for
others
first
though
brown
in
its
color
i
would
better
consider
this
beer
to
be
a
flanders
red
ale
rather
than
an
oude
bruin
its
much
sharper
and
cherrylike
that
the
mustfriendly
brown
ales
murky
brown
color
with
reddish
highlights
this
beer
has
a
thick
tan
small
bubbled
head
lots
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
of
candy
apple
and
earth
musty
mixed
with
a
tangy
sweet
scent
lots
of
yeast
scent
as
well
the
taste
is
both
sweet
and
sour
with
a
little
slant
to
the
tangy
side
not
quite
mouth
puckering
but
rather
cleansing
fuller
in
body
than
i
expected
this
is
a
nice
beer
on
style
and
very
approachable
as
far
as
the
taste
goes
this
is
definitely
a
sour
ale
with
notes
of
cherry
and
a
low
but
lingering
bitterness
i
will
admit
that
sours
are
not
top
on
my
list
of
styles
but
this
one
was
not
bad
overall
this
has
been
a
confusing
beer
to
me
not
the
best
oude
bruin
but
a
decent
one
othis
is
not
the
best
oud
bruin
ive
had
it
lacked
complexity
and
punch
on
the
tongue
and
it
was
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
the
style
but
a
little
more
sourpower
and
this
thing
might
move
up
a
few
notches
that
being
said
the
appearance
and
aroma
were
pleasing
overall
a
beer
i
could
really
get
into
has
the
full
fledge
wild
fermentation
aspect
along
with
a
very
realistic
beer
body
perhaps
a
little
sweet
but
that
compliments
the
tartness
tough
to
avoid
the
comparison
here
but
try
it
and
you
may
agree
its
a
great
beer
all
the
same
overall
i
had
never
seen
this
on
the
shelf
before
and
ill
never
pass
up
the
chance
to
try
a
new
flanders
i
think
i
paid
6
for
this
bottle
and
it
definetly
wasnt
worth
that
if
you
literally
had
no
other
sour
options
fine
but
it
is
the
definition
of
mediocre
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
midlevel
carbonation
that
creates
a
fairly
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
finish
is
dry
with
little
residual
stickiness
on
the
palate
overall
its
basically
flawless
and
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
overall
while
it
has
some
nice
aromas
and
fruit
flavors
upfront
the
very
vinegary
flavors
sort
of
turn
me
off
this
is
not
really
my
style
of
beer
so
if
you
like
sours
it
has
some
nice
characteristics
but
if
you
dont
like
sours
then
o
pretty
nice
definitely
an
oud
bruin
not
a
flanders
would
recommend
overall
moderately
malty
fruity
aged
oakiness
slightly
sour
not
the
best
but
certainly
good
stuff
od
nice
enjoyed
it
as
it
captured
the
flavours
i
was
expecting
properly
and
fit
the
style
balanced
accordingly
nice
stuff
mouthfeel
is
slightly
dry
fairly
light
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
no
rodenbach
grand
cru
appearance
is
a
burgundy
color
with
fluffy
looking
white
head
on
the
nose
there
is
cherry
wood
and
sourness
this
one
looks
like
it
is
going
to
be
fairly
sour
upon
sipping
sure
enough
that
aspect
was
there
along
with
more
of
those
cherries
some
belgian
candy
and
yeast
was
also
part
of
the
flavor
mouthfeel
on
this
one
was
dry
nice
carbonation
some
of
that
tart
quality
sits
on
your
palate
for
a
bit
certainly
one
to
have
some
water
and
crackers
afterwords
overall
its
harsh
and
too
oaky
the
flavors
arent
inherently
bad
but
the
feel
just
cancels
out
all
benefits
o
very
enjoyable
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
not
as
tartsour
than
some
of
the
others
in
the
style
this
beer
is
very
approachable
and
definitely
one
that
i
would
like
to
enjoy
again
overall
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
tasted
good
but
i
wont
be
in
a
hurry
to
drink
it
again
great
nose
good
looking
but
the
taste
didnt
rise
to
the
occasion
still
a
very
nice
flanders
that
i
probably
should
have
held
onto
another
year
before
cracking
open
ill
go
pick
another
one
up
the
liquid
comes
out
looking
dark
reddish
in
hue
with
some
brown
strokes
set
within
a
nice
fuzzy
coca
cola
like
head
skims
up
with
some
tightness
and
a
off
tan
color
to
it
no
stick
on
the
glass
smell
is
pretty
much
deep
vinegar
with
some
faint
cherry
scent
and
some
grain
trace
amounts
of
caramel
notes
but
this
one
is
all
about
the
vinegar
taste
is
sweet
over
sour
and
its
very
apparent
vinegar
cherry
cola
sweet
malt
you
get
the
picture
very
reminiscent
of
duchesses
feel
is
less
than
medium
a
nice
crisp
carb
and
not
acidic
not
a
pucker
inducing
beer
but
pleasant
i
just
cant
stand
the
vinegar
i
could
only
drink
6oz
of
this
before
passing
on
it
o
i
like
it
to
my
lips
its
as
simple
as
a
sour
brown
ale
and
i
normally
dont
like
brown
ales
i
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
12
oz
of
this
it
kinda
baffles
me
that
so
many
sours
are
served
in
750ml
bottles
ill
finish
the
bottle
happy
that
i
tried
it
though
verdict
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
i
definitely
appreciate
the
aroma
the
beer
didnt
seem
too
complex
at
first
whiff
but
after
about
4
more
tries
i
started
picking
up
the
chocolate
notes
it
definitely
surprised
me
how
complex
the
aroma
was
still
the
taste
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
sour
and
not
so
much
sweetness
im
not
saying
it
was
very
sweet
but
it
did
have
that
slight
doppelbock
caramel
note
i
was
not
expecting
in
a
flemish
sour
i
would
try
again
if
offered
but
im
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
i
would
rather
recommend
monks
cafe
flemish
sour
for
someone
who
is
new
to
sours
it
may
not
be
as
complex
but
it
is
definitely
more
enjoyable
imo
overall
great
beginers
sour
could
be
a
sour
you
can
have
more
than
one
of
which
might
be
what
i
do
overall
this
was
a
good
drink
but
it
didnt
set
itself
aside
as
something
id
pick
up
again
i
forogt
what
i
paid
for
this
one
under
a
12oz
bottle
so
per
bottle
is
always
a
part
of
the
equasion
tastes
like
it
smells
very
smooth
and
sweet
for
a
flandersi
split
this
with
a
friend
as
a
way
to
preface
drinking
an
upland
gilgamesh
so
he
could
see
if
he
liked
sour
beers
before
i
went
and
opened
up
an
expensive
bomber
of
a
beer
so
tart
it
makes
your
cheeks
burn
thisthis
was
not
a
proper
preface
still
it
was
pretty
darn
good
on
its
own
ichtegems
grand
cru
is
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
however
the
draught
version
i
had
yesterday
was
far
superior
older
refrigerated
bottle2009
poured
into
a
nostradamus
flute
glass
pours
a
dark
mahogany
amber
with
red
tints
half
finger
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
looks
nice
aroma
of
cherry
light
fruit
wood
lightly
vinegar
and
sour
flavor
is
sour
and
acidic
but
balanced
by
a
cherry
flavored
sweetness
medium
bodied
with
some
creaminess
nice
interaction
of
the
sour
and
sweet
i
do
not
favor
sour
beers
but
this
one
works
quite
nicely
for
me
worth
a
periodic
revisit
older
refrigerated
bottle
probably
from
2009
overall
bummer
it
started
out
great
and
i
was
really
excited
until
i
tasted
it
i
thought
there
was
going
to
be
more
of
a
sour
tartness
to
it
there
wasnt
i
also
expected
more
carbonation
bummer
2
55
o
a
good
beer
not
overly
impressive
but
one
i
was
glad
to
try
this
one
was
a
pick
a
random
belgian
beer
and
buy
it
purchase
and
im
not
disappointed
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
though
o
kind
of
a
let
down
this
was
not
nearly
sour
or
tart
enough
to
satisfy
that
sourale
addiction
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
the
mouth
watering
sour
ale
that
i
and
many
others
crave
from
this
style
o
overall
a
good
enjoyable
beer
ive
had
examples
of
the
style
that
are
more
complex
and
delicious
but
this
is
one
is
worth
trying
pours
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
one
finger
cocoa
head
excellent
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
very
dark
and
impossible
to
see
through
the
nose
is
nice
sour
fruit
some
grain
cherry
plum
and
slight
alcohol
in
the
background
the
taste
is
nice
and
tart
with
some
funk
sour
fruit
and
a
definite
bite
to
the
aftertaste
not
quite
as
complex
as
id
hoped
and
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
still
not
shabby
at
all
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
for
the
style
but
you
can
find
better
cheers
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
style
and
it
has
left
we
wanting
to
explore
more
flanders
red
ales
a
quality
beer
future
outlook
i
actually
took
my
own
advice
to
start
drinking
some
flanders
type
beers
more
often
good
for
me
think
it
might
be
time
to
sock
a
few
away
for
aging
purposes
not
bad
a
bit
less
sharp
than
i
like
flavors
are
there
but
a
bit
soft
still
a
very
worthy
brew
id
have
this
again
d
a
solid
flanders
the
taste
and
feel
were
a
bit
of
a
letdown
when
the
appearance
and
smell
were
great
but
this
is
still
quite
and
enjoyable
beer
nonetheless
overall
this
is
great
something
totally
different
than
what
im
used
to
but
very
enjoyable
now
im
on
a
quest
to
find
other
grand
crus
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
overall
drinkability
powerful
but
balanced
no
off
characters
good
sour
taste
impressed
sometimes
flanders
come
off
a
little
weak
in
that
department
especially
when
theyre
relatively
cheap
and
available
like
this
one
really
a
good
introduction
that
isnt
watered
down
or
so
pase
its
lame
cherry
is
the
most
fruit
specific
flavor
that
exists
in
it
gritty
acidic
tannin
like
qualities
to
it
mild
woody
flavor
enough
sweetness
to
it
to
approach
balance
ultimately
finishes
dry
o
not
a
bad
beer
would
be
interested
to
see
if
it
gets
more
sour
with
time
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
the
flavor
has
some
offtones
and
thats
my
primary
complaint
its
in
the
finish
that
im
put
off
o
great
sourdry
flemish
ale
with
a
nice
background
of
natural
cherry
overall
this
is
a
neat
beer
and
my
first
in
this
style
im
definitely
interested
in
trying
more
drinks
like
a
flemish
red
with
no
lack
of
delicious
funky
belgian
action
this
beer
pours
a
red
heavy
amber
in
color
between
light
and
medium
in
body
with
a
white
lacing
around
the
glass
it
smells
of
lightly
sour
milk
and
of
a
stale
amber
ale
its
really
really
subtle
for
the
style
and
doesnt
offer
very
much
it
tastes
of
a
sweet
and
soured
malt
there
isnt
much
complexity
isnt
any
vinegar
but
it
does
have
a
light
miracle
whip
component
it
drinks
light
and
is
equally
between
sweet
and
an
actual
sour
its
mediocre
all
around
i
expected
more
from
a
grand
cru
despite
the
ratings
o
this
was
a
bit
of
an
awkward
one
i
think
the
oak
was
either
far
too
young
or
the
beer
itself
is
too
young
its
quite
different
in
many
ways
but
the
acidity
is
really
the
most
dominant
aspect
of
the
flavor
unfortunately
this
one
drinks
more
like
medicine
than
it
does
beer
and
makes
you
feel
like
the
small
bottle
is
more
than
enough
o
in
the
tearful
words
of
tyra
banks
i
was
rooting
for
you
i
really
did
want
to
enjoy
this
but
the
light
funky
flavor
had
me
feeling
ripped
off
its
not
an
offensive
beer
it
just
doesnt
blow
me
off
my
swivel
chair
all
in
all
a
nice
drinking
lighter
alternative
to
some
of
the
heavy
hitting
sours
wont
blow
your
mind
but
shouldnt
disappoint
either
pretty
solid
nothing
jumping
out
at
me
good
level
of
sourness
though
a
little
vegative
mid
sip
not
necessarily
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
with
that
being
said
the
front
end
taste
of
the
beer
i
didnt
mind
glad
i
tried
it
but
thats
probably
it
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
beer
that
isnt
too
sour
overall
i
struggled
to
finish
the
glass
a
menagerie
of
strange
offflavors
with
only
a
shadow
of
flanders
red
character
i
was
hoping
for
a
costeffective
flanders
fix
but
this
aint
it
im
glad
i
tried
it
only
because
im
a
big
fan
of
the
style
if
youre
considering
tying
your
first
flanders
red
do
not
start
here
a
very
sessionable
flanders
red
not
over
the
top
like
many
ive
had
but
scaled
back
with
enough
to
be
typical
of
the
style
brown
red
and
opaque
no
head
retention
or
lace
sour
fruit
aroma
and
start
not
nearly
as
sour
as
many
flanders
reds
ive
had
but
still
with
the
tartness
and
fermented
apples
taste
reminiscent
of
the
style
very
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
light
body
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
quite
a
nice
example
of
a
flemish
sour
didnt
know
that
aged
sours
existed
but
this
one
is
quite
worthwhile
though
theres
no
oak
in
the
taste
edit
the
distributors
confirmed
that
this
beer
and
strubbes
flemish
red
ale
grand
cru
httpbeeradvocate
combeerprofile229928420
are
identical
beers
despite
having
different
labels
one
thing
is
for
certain
is
that
its
not
a
tongue
slayer
nor
a
palate
ripper
is
not
going
to
punish
with
puckering
perhaps
flemish
red
on
the
front
and
our
bruin
on
the
back
is
a
trifle
misleading
if
anyones
expecting
rodenbach
or
jacobins
theyll
be
very
disappointed
ive
met
some
already
who
arebut
not
this
guy
the
preceding
sips
are
the
same
it
is
not
my
favorite
flemish
red
but
it
is
a
good
beer
definitely
worth
trying
a
good
clean
solid
honest
original
beer

on
the

smells
of

i
was
expecting
grape

slight

unripe

are
the
tastes
i
am
getting
from
this
beer
better
than
average
carbonation
but
it
feels
a
bit
lacking
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
serving
type
bottle
opinion
this
is
a
good
beer
no
doubt
well
crafted
it
is
bit
light
for
my
taste
but
i
really
like
rodenbach
which
has
me
jaded
a
bit
this
isnt
as
much
of
an
entry
beer
as
others
in
this
category
but
it
is
a
bit
muted
in
the
delivery
for
my
taste
if
you
are
going
to
go
for
it
knock
me
out
otherwise
strive
to
be
the
duchesse
oits
a
good
representation
of
the
style
it
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
into
sours
i
believe
not
the
best
but
certainly
not
the
worst
this
brew
was
like
a
mix
of
sour
cherries
and
apple
cider
vinegar
it
was
really
tart
and
strong
this
isnt
something
id
ever
drink
an
entire
bottle
of
i
just
cant
get
passed
how
sour
it
was
i
love
the
red
color
that
this
brew
has
theres
not
much
head
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
im
just
not
into
the
flavors
this
one
has
to
offer
taste
is
acidic
yeasty
with
a

of
woody
sweetsour
fruits
light
woodypeppery
bitterness
at
finish
hints
of
vinegar
and
metal
its
wonderful
engaging
and
very
drinkable
this
one
is
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
lacks
that
fantastic
sourlike
nose
and
the
flavor
is
thick
rich
and
sweet
and
opposed
to
more
crisp
and
sour

i

id
easily
pick
this
up
again
at

50
a
11
2oz
bottle
d
this
is
a
good
flanders
red
ale
ive
had
better
but
it
was
certainly
worth
the
selection
from
the
store
d
a
very
interesting
mix
of
fruit
and
beer
is
it
the
best
mix
i
dont
know
verdict
ok
for
the
style
there
are
many
better
at
this
price
point
but
a
decent
ale
nonetheless
overall
a
good
if
not
great
beer
not
a
fantastic
flanders
red
but
not
awful
either
pretty
mediocre
di
could
see
this
being
a
good
gateway
flanders
red
but
certainy
not
a
great
representation
of
the
style
d
pretty
good
but
this
beer
was
kind
of
basic
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
one
not
really
worth
the
4
for
the
11
2oz
bottle
its
subdued
on
the
tongue
not
terribly
sour

mild
acetic
acid
mineral

oak
bit
of
a
metallic

the
body
is
thin
carbonation
surprisingly
not
excessive
guess
most
of
it
went
to
the
head
finishes
with
a
mild
metallic
twang
some
balsamiclike
acetic
acid
and
light
oak
tannins
pretty
nice
stuff
easy
to
quaff
or
sit
down
and
ponder
for
a
while
doverall
a
light
easy
drinking
sour
with
lots
of
flavor
d
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
because
the
taste
isnt
overly
sour
i
would
definitely
try
this
again
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
it
will
leave
a
nice
suprise
for
you
its
something
a
little
different
which
i
enjoy
great
moderately
high
carbonation
creates
a
dry
refreshing
finish
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
a
tingle
of
alcohol
warmth
is
felt
in
the
back
of
the
throat
easy
drinking
but
a
little
bit
of
a
mess
the
cider
verse
sweetness
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
drink
if
sour
and
fruity
is
your
thing
this
one
goes
down
no
problem
more
on
the
mild
side
of
what
can
be
accomplished
with
the
style
taste
reflected
the
noise
definitely
sour
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
rather
one
dimensional
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
this
beer
is
really
nice
but
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
duchesse
goudenband
or
rodenbach
grand
cru
other
killer
examples
of
the
style
its
a
shame
because
this
beer
promised
a
lot
but
it
eventually
revealed
itself
as
a
pale
imitation
of
the
greats
its
not
bad
and
its
a
tasty
belgian
ale
but
the
style
is
so
much
better
than
this
example
would
have
you
believe
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
far
from
the
top
of
the
class
for
this
style
and
another
d
really
disappointing
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
and
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
anyone
like
i
said
before
if
you
would
like
a
baseline
for
a
decent
flemish
grab
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
for
a
nice
complex
oud
bruin
grab

haandbakk
a
middle
of

road
flanders
red
the
punchy
flavours
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
are
not
to
be
found
but
the
overall
flavour
is
okay
this
is
pretty
tasty
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
like
a
little
more
body
and
richness
but
still
quite
good
all
in
all
a
good
beer
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
d
very
drinkable
for
the
style
i
think
not
too
high
in
alcohol
and
not
so
sour
that
you
want
to
stop
after
one
opaque
dark
red
with
a
thin
white
head
lovely
winelike
smell
with
a
strong
vinegar
essence
delicious
sour
flavor
that
does
indeed
taste
like
cherries
nothing
like
cough
syrup
or
fake
cherry
flavor
a
little
too
sweet
but
still
very
good
medium
carbonation
that
was
highly
drinkable
which
really
surprised
me
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
type
that
ive
had
and
i
am
really
impressed
my
belly
warmed
with
each
swig
i
took
11
2
ounce
bottle

served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
about
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
went
away
pretty
quickly
theres
a
small
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
vinegar
tart
apples
and
cherries
and
some
wood
however
the
flavor
isnt
very
tart
at
all
i
can
taste
tart
apples
and
cherries
and
vinegar
but
theres
also
a
lot
of
caramel
malt
and
sweet
dark
fruit
noticable
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
the
tartness
isnt
even
close
to
what
i
expected
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
the
aroma
would
lead
you
to
believe
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
little
bit
coating
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
enough
i
think
its
a
decent
brew
but
if
youre
looking
for
something
sour
i
dont
think
this
is
the
best
choice
doverall
a
great
beer
that
may
not
be
as
strong
as
other
beers
but
is
extremely
drinkable
light
lactobacillus
tartness
along
with
a
mellow
slightly
buttery
and
milky
flavor
malts
are
present
and
add
weight
but
not
much
flavor
kind
of
lacks
personality
but
to
its
credit
there
is
nothing
offputting
about
this
beer
hint
of
oak
in
the
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
the
best
part
i
thought
it
was
creamy
with
a
fine
cascading
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
given
the
lack
of
intensity
and
relatively
low
abv
but
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
missing
something
not
a
bad
beer
here
though
not
my
favorite
by
far
pours
a
nice
ruby
amber
color
with
moderate
sandy
head

is
pretty
normal
for
a
flanders
red
ale
though
a
but
restrained
lightly
toasted
malts

a

some
sweetness
to
it
too

though
the
sourvinegar

attenuatedim
looking
for
a
bit
more
out
of
this
style
of
beer
here
drinks
like
a
decent
light
brown
ale
though
i
would
have
trouble
picking
it
out
as
a
flanders
dry
on
the
finish
light
and
snappy
decent
drink
though
i
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
to
this
one
d
wish
a
sixer
or
four
pack
was
cheap
this
is
very
good
and
a
nice
change
from
the
normal
american
craft
ichtegems
grand
cru
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
flemish
red
worth
trying
if
youre
into
the
style
d
this
is
not
a
beer
that
could
be
pounded
down
in
large
amounts
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
to
sip
on
a
bottle
or
two
at
a
time
d
for
this
style
this
is
a
very
approachable
and
drinkable
beer
if
you
have
a
wino
friend
that
is
looking
for
a
beer
this
is
the
one
to
give
them
d
overall
another
clunker
from
the
sour
beer
crew
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
recommended
if
you
love
sours
its
really
a
old
bruin
not
sure
why
they
keep
added
them
to
the
red
category
sure
it
s
that
on
the
bottle
but
then
contradicts
itself
in
the
native
dutch
go
figure
who
cares
right
we
drink
more
its
good
d
decent
sour
not
interesting
enough
to
pay
import
pricing
deep
red
almost
purple

some

rising
from
bottom

very
little

forward
dark

a
pretty
dry

despite
the

tart
and
sweet
some
hints
of
blackberries
and
concord
grapes
deep
fruit
flavor
minimal
hops
and
a
wee
bit
of
funk
some
horseblanket
funkiness
on
back
end
a
pretty
complex
tasting
beer
mouthfeel
is
fairly
full
for
the
style
a
bit
sticky
not
a
lot
of
effervescence
pretty
drinkable
more
fruity
than
rodenbach
imo
wondering
how
the
bottle
version
compares
to
this
relatively
rare
keg
so
overall
i
enjoyed
this
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
probably
more
so
than
with
beers
like
the
dutchess
or
rodenbach
as
theres
less
of
the
tart
vinegar
to
balance
things
out
this
was
unique
and
i
like
beers
that
have
distinctive
qualities
i
would
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
this
is
an
above
average
flemish
fed
worth
trying
to
get
different
taste
than
the
top
two
in
this
style
but
clearly
a
notch
below
if
you
want
a
good
entrance
into
the
world
of
sour
beers
this
could
be
a
good
intermediate
step
it
doesnt
overwhelm
you
with
sour
the
fruit
sweetness
might
be
a
bit
much
but
its
not
really
cloying
the
body
is
nice
but
there
are
times
when
the
tang
reads
as
metallic
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
the
lips
maybe
its
something
that
was
on
my
lips
prior
to
my
first
sip
dthis
is
not
my
favorite
style
however
ichtegem
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
those
who
like
flemish
ale
will
surely
enjoy
this
one
d
while
this
is
drinkable
this
is
not
what
i
was
expectingthin
and
not
nearly
sour
enough
meh
enjoyable
for
what
it
offers
however
i
probably
wont
go
back
to
it
decent
but
but
monotone
and
fairly
watery
ive
been
exploring
the
flanders
red
style
as
of
late
and
so
far
this
is
the
most
lackluster
of
the
bunch
the
taste
is
rather
tart
some
cherry
or
plum
and
some
grain
in
the
background
a
little
sour
and
watery
this
is
a
typical
belgian
taste
its
quite
drinkable
and
not
at
all
unpleasant
but
a
little
underwhelming
if
youre
looking
for
sourtart
go
elsewhere
drinkability
a
pretty
bold
red
ale
complex
has
some
imperfections
good
not
my
favorite
flanders
ale
by
a
long
shot
but
i
like
how
it
morphed
halfway
through
id
have
it
again
in
the
future
though
one
per
sitting
is
sufficient
taste
is
carbonation
dark
fruits
sour
and
wild
yeast
ends
smooth
and
tart
d
easy
to
drink
given
my
analogy
above
to
a
margarita
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
as
a
cocktail
before
or
during
a
spicy
mexican
dish
not
sure
if
id
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
two
of
these
i
was
ready
to
move
onto
something
else
after
my
first
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
considering
the
sweetness
drinkability
is
reasonable
ill
finish
the
bottle
but
i
wont
buy
another
i
have
now
finished
at
750
lm
bottle
and
i
still
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
one
even
though
this
one
took
me
some
one
and
a
half
hours
to
finish
d
too
sweet
for
me
and
it
just
overwhelms
all
of
the
intricacies
that
i
look
for
in
flemish
sour
d
nice
and
refreshing
a
beer
even
for
winesnobs
i
shouldnt
have
expected
too
much
for
this
beer
but
somehow
i
feel
a
bit
disappointed
and
cheated
this
is
certainly
not
horrible
but
to
my
preferences
it
is
not
sour
or
tart
enough
and
it
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
richness
too
hell
even
some
rustic
funkiness
would
be
welcome
drinkability
i
love
the
refreshing
characteristics
of
sour
ales
ichtegems
grand
cru
is
a
solid
refreshing
tasty
flanders
red
that
i
could
probably
drink
all
day
d
as
pleased
as
i
was
with
the
nose
i
find
the
flavor
to
be
a
bit
disappointing
to
say
the
least
the
fact
that
the
beer
is
so
heavily
carbonated
didnt
do
much
for
me
either
this
is
a
nice
not
too
rabid
not
too
sweet
flanders
red
ale
drinking
one
of
these
reminds
me
of
a
particular
sparkling
wine
that
many
consume
to
ring
in
the
new
year
d
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
the
style
the
modest
flavors
allow
for
a
fair
amount
of
consumption
d
a
decent
example
of
a
flemish
sour
ale
but
not
overly
special
poured
into
a
tulip
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
retains
itself
longer
than
youd
expect
with
the
acidity
of
the
beer
aroma
is
cherries
prunes
wood
flavor
is
mainly
a
slimy
cherry
cola
sweetness
with
some
weird
grapes
and
wood
its
got
some
tartness
and
acidity
but
no
complexity
or
body
mouthfeel
is
too
carbonated
and
thin
not
buying
this
again
hard
to
finish
the
11
or
so
ounces
i
had
nice
citric
limed
malt
finish
hints
of
sour
all
around
and
one
almost
wants
it
to
be
more
sour
but
very
drinkable
d
goes
down
fairly
easy
for
a
sour
flanders
not
drinkable
but
good
bought
a
750
ml
bottle
and
shared
with
friends
at
a
dinner
the
color
was
a
hazy
brown
red
with
a
great
head
and
nice
lacing
it
look
good
in
the
goblet
and
smelled
of
fruit
mainly
some
tart
cherries
and
some
sourdough
bread
the
taste
was
delicious
it
was
sour
patch
sweet
with
cherry
tartness
a
hint
of
vinegar
malt
hops
and
some
other
fruit
and
spices
enjoy
this
one
with
friends
like
a
bottle
of
wine
or
an
aperitif
before
or
with
dinner
drinkability
is
good
easygoing
and
mellow
with
a
solid
fruit
and
barrel
aged
quality
along
with
a
solid
profile
an
all
around
good
brew
cheers
tastes
of
raisin
brown
sugar
and
a
mild
tart
minerallike
flavor
to
it
not
particularly
tasty
missing
all
of
the
tartness
acetic
or
oak
characters
that
i
look
for
medium
bodied
with
a
somewhat
smooth
medium
level
of
carbonation
i
finished
the
bottle
but
was
glad
it
did
not
come
in
a
750
ml
size
d
i
enjoyed
the
beer
and
will
purchase
it
again
in
the
future
i
have
another
bottle
i
want
to
share
with
a
friend
who
likes
the
style
procured
from
red
carpet
wine
liquor
glendale
ca
d
drinkable
enough
but
not
my
favorite
flemish
redbrown
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
have
liked
and
not
as
sour
as
i
would
have
liked
either
all
in
all
this
was
a
weaker
version
of
the
style
which
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
and
a
bit
watered
down
i
was
expecting
a
fuller
mouthfeel
tart
and
puckering
but
much
more
of
a
vinegary
sourness
than
expected
lots
of
oak
and
vanilla
character
with
a
pleasant
dark
fruit
flavor
dark
cherries
plum
and
raisin
notes
with
a
dry
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
nearly
measure
up
to
the
better
versions
of
this
style
although
not
a
masterpiece
this
isnt
a
bad
rendition
and
only
suffers
based
on
comparisons
with
other
more
established
brews
dont
drink
and
review
a
sweet
pleasing
flanders
red
this
beer
pours
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
better
than
expected
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
sour
cherries
with
a
touch
of
malt
the
flavor
is
similar
with
a
mediumlight
vinegar
kick
my
score
is
dropping
as
i
go
through
my
glass
which
is
never
a
good
sign
theres
a
somewhat
cloying
syrupy
character
to
the
beer
im
not
good
enough
at
beer
tasting
to
tell
if
its
backsweetened
but
it
tastes
that
way
to
me
if
this
beer
was
bone
dry
id
like
it
a
whole
lot
more
as
is
the
sweet
cherry
flavor
is
growing
acrid
on
my
palate
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
prefer
a
bit
less
sweet
in
my
sours
a
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
a
malty
complexity
balances
out
the
tart
though
doesnt
overwhelm
it
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
its
not
as
strong
as
some
others
but
it
has
a
nice
uniqueness
and
is
very
drinkable
served
with
very
little
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
dark
cloudy
brown
with
some
reddish
highlights
maybe
a
little
light
struck
some
burnt
rubberskunk
flavors
not
quite
as
skunky
as
aroma
and
i
get
some
of
the
nice
tart
malt
with
fruit
in
the
background
had
another
bottle
of
this
here
recently
and
it
was
much
better
no
skunk
good
mouth
and
carbonation
skunks
gone
at
the
end
good
finish
no
sense
of
the
alcohol
at
all
id
try
another
edit
after
looking
at
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
wonder
if
i
was
served
the
correct
beer
as
my
review
doesnt
sound
like
any
of
the
other
ones
i
am
reviewing
from
my
tasting
notes
and
i
left
no
indication
that
this
one
tasted
sour
at
all
i
was
pretty
disappointed
here
the
drinkability
is
high
on
my
scale
the
sour
taste
is
such
that
it
cleans
my
palate
and
tells
me
to
keep
coming
back
for
more
yet
there
are
enough
other
things
going
on
that
it
never
becomes
too
much
this
beer
will
not
blow
you
out
of
your
seat
in
terms
of
sourness
like
some
flanders
but
i
think
that
it
is
still
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
again
i
found
myself
losing
interest
after
the
first
few
sips
knocking
a
few
points
off
drinkability
its
an
easydrinking
beer
but
you
simply
find
yourself
bored
with
it
very
quickly
d
i
must
admit
i
am
not
familiar
with
this
style
of
beer
i
typically
do
not
enjoy
belgian
beers
for
their
lactic
sourness
but
this
beer
was
different
the
sourness
and
i
use
the
word
sour
for
lack
of
a
better
term
was
akin
to
the
sourness
or
acidity
present
in
wine
was
well
balanced
and
was
in
no
ways
distracting
or
offputting
this
was
a
very
good
beer
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
paired
well
with
food
i
could
not
see
it
being
one
i
could
drink
repeatedly
as
the
unique
flavor
profile
could
be
fatiguing
but
otherwise
quite
enjoyable
d
if
this
was
a
little
less
sweet
andor
was
a
bit
more
sour
this
would
be
better
the
sweetness
lingers
on
the
palate
a
bit
too
long
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
sour
with
vinegar
fruit
and
oak
the
appearance
is
amber
with
a
large
head
and
floating
particles
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
the
finish
is
sour
overall
its
sweeter
than
most
of
the
style
but
this
is
probably
likable
for
many
that
like
the
style
i
have
had
better
this
might
have
been
aged
a
little
but
im
not
sure
d
slight
promise
in
appearance
and
smell
but
all
down
hill
from
there
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
frankly
i
prefer
more
acidity
just
had
rodenbachs
grand
cru
last
night
so
ive
got
a
very
fresh
impression
for
comparison
and
prefer
that
for
sure
still
its
not
bad
exceptionally
smooth
pours
a
clear
brown
with
dark
cherry
tinges
and
a
medium
beige
head
the
foam
subsides
after
a
short
period
to
leave
a
thin
film
and
some
lacing
smells
fairly
sour
with
some
fruit
notes
coming
through
sweet
malt
in
the
background
along
with
some
woody
earthiness
the
taste
echoes
this
with
a
sharp
though
not
overpowering
sourness
at
first
as
the
palate
gets
accustomed
to
this
some
vinous
notes
become
evident
and
the
crystal
malt
comes
through
finishes
dry
and
oaky
smooth
feel
thanks
to
the
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
a
pretty
decent
oud
bruin
this
might
be
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
had
it
is
light
refreshing
and
keeps
begging
for
partners
to
follow
great
brew
d
certainly
a
different
take
on
the
style
than
the
more
lactic
character
in
something
like
rodenbach
an
interesting
experience
i
think
any
sour
fan
should
try
it
out
i
had
not
heard
a
lot
about
this
beer
but
it
was
very
enjoyable
it
was
quite
a
bit
different
earthier
and
fullbodied
though
less
complex
than
the
duchesse
pick
a
bottle
of
this
up
if
you
happen
to
see
it
d
at
6
5
not
one
of
the
strongest
of
the
style
ive
had
as
such
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
could
probably
have
a
couple
slightly
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
cap
of
dark
beige
foam
the
collar
was
a
bit
rocky
with
fine
bubbles
covering
the
beer
light
tartness
in
the
aroma
berries
and
unripe
fruits
a
little
earthy
very
slightly
acetic
mild
sourness
with
a
bit
of
toffee
amid
the
berry
cherry
and
red
grape
fruit
flavours
and
the
leafy
earthiness
a
bit
more
acidic
in
the
finish
as
the
other
flavours
faded
medium
to
light
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
a
bit
viscous
easy
drinking
and
probably
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
those
not
already
into
sour
beers
this
seems
like
a
very
simple
beer
only
very
slightly
tarttangy
and
not
much
complex
sourness
or
funkyness
very
drinkable
nothing
special
about
this
and
i
think
ill
stick
with
the
duchesse
d
nice
easy
to
drink
not
a
good
beer
to
start
some
one
with
this
style
with
but
a
nice
version
of
it
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
reddish
with
a
little
white
head
medium
plus
mouthfeel
pleasant
flemish
red
aroma
easy
drinking
to
the
last
drop
nice
balance
with
a
little
vinegar
and
well
done
sweet
offset
a
moderate
cherry
the
mildest
of
oak
tasty
one
understated
carbonation
it
pours
a
froathy
brown
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
newcastle
and
for
the
money
i
think
it
would
rather
just
drink
newcastle
d
this
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
at
least
until
you
swallow
this
beer
im
not
sure
ill
finish
it
probably
let
it
sit
for
an
hour
before
i
continue
drinking
overall
this
one
is
deceptive
looks
like
a
flemish
sour
and
smells
kinda
like
one
but
does
not
taste
like
what
i
have
associated
with
the
style
to
taste
like
still
very
unique
and
approachable
and
would
be
incredibly
food
friendly
all
in
all
im
starting
to
enjoy
grand
crus
and
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
little
rougher
then
some
of
the
others
i
have
tried
recently
im
not
sure
how
grand
crus
age
but
im
thinking
that
with
a
year
or
two
some
of
the
tart
and
bitter
flavors
would
mellow
out
a
bit
d
drinkable
but
not
worth
5
moderate
level
of
carbonation
but
it
has
a
filmy
slickness
at
the
end
that
is
distracting
overall
its
a
little
too
dull
to
pique
sustained
interest
worth
trying
but
not
a
repeat
buy
rodenbach
buries
this
by
a
landslide
oud
bruin
or
not
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
red
hue
very
light
brown
head
small
no
lace
smell
is
malty
light
cherry
taste
is
quite
doughy
that
has
a
oaky
and
vanilla
like
quality
strong
lingering
taste
of
oak
on
the
palate
light
fruit
cherry
with
hint
of
grape
and
black
berry
there
is
some
tart
but
it
blends
with
everything
evenly
not
very
strong
very
nice
mouthfeel
easily
passes
for
a
oud
bruin
in
the
likes
of
a
rodenbach
overall
i
was
impressed
im
just
now
getting
into
sours
but
i
was
a
fan
of
the
way
none
of
the
flavors
were
too
overpowering
in
this
beer
certainly
worth
a
shot
drinkability
is
moderate
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
the
style
its
inaccurate
and
boring
mouthfeel
was
mild
in
the
beginning
with
a
zesty
swallow
my
local
bar
keeps
this
stocked
and
i
sometimes
order
2
or
3
in
a
session
i
ask
for
the
gouda
beer
very
good
stuff
superdark
brown
with
red
tints
if
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
it
smells
pretty
good
like
sour
vinegar
and
then
sweet
the
taste
is
slightly
sour
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
not
nearly
as
intense
as
some
of
the
other
flemish
reds
like
la
folie
or
la
roja
thanks
to
rblwthacoz
for
this
interesting
brew
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
yet
this
is
a
sipping
beer
because
there
is
plenty
going
on
i
dont
remember
what
i
paid
for
my
330ml
bottle
i
know
i
purchased
it
in
council
bluffs
ia
if
it
is
priced
reasonably
id
buy
more
of
this
while
not
the
best
of
the
style
it
is
unique
and
that
is
good
enough
for
me
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
with
a
ruby
hue
and
a
thin
creme
head
nose
is
mildly
funky
fruity
and
sour
flavor
is
smooth
but
almost
mild
in
a
way
theres
some
cherry
to
it
and
some
wood
but
overall
it
doesnt
really
go
crazy
with
anything
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
lower
overall
an
easier
drinking
flanders
the
sweet
and
sour
aroma
carried
on
into
the
taste
the
oak
barrels
used
to
age
this
beer
adds
a
cherry
and
almonds
hint
to
everything
easy
to
drink
and
pleasing
in
every
way
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
well
worth
finding
taste
is
tart
but
in
a
mild
way
it
does
dominate
the
whole
beer
but
is
not
toothaching
sour
the
wood
aging
is
oaky
and
dark
again
a
nice
spiciness
coming
from
the
yeast
which
reminds
me
of
coriander
and
lemongrass
body
is
medium
although
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
this
beer
is
very
well
drinkable
and
once
you
get
through
the
initial
sourness
of
the
first
sip
it
is
a
great
thirstquencher
this
beer
might
not
be
the
most
complex
in
its
style
but
it
is
a
very
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
beer
i
enjoyed
it
d
ive
been
on
a
sour
kick
when
i
can
get
them
on
tap
lately
started
by
allagash
rosa
and
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
massively
sour
and
funky
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
can
see
how
this
would
not
be
for
some
but
id
love
to
try
more
of
these
obviously
drinking
too
many
of
these
would
probably
have
the
same
effect
as
drinking
too
many
hop
bombs
blown
tastebuds
but
i
wouldve
gladly
had
another
d
drinks
much
bigger
then
its
advertised
6
5
a
good
desert
beer
that
would
make
for
an
ample
substitution
of
red
wine
at
any
meal
mouthfeel
was
ok
not
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
solid
pour
brown
color
with
amber
highlights
along
the
glasss
edges
offwhite
creamy
head
one
finger
that
slowly
dissolves
down
to
a
quarter
inch
film
and
then
holds
nose
only
starts
to
come
through
once
the
beer
warms
up
mildly
sour
with
salty
malt
light
toffee
sweetness
and
lightly
vinous
not
bad
but
certainly
not
overpowering
nor
overly
complex
flavor
is
nice
dry
swarthy
spiced
sour
malt
up
front
that
sourness
heats
up
as
the
beer
goes
on
dirty
lightly
roasted
feel
shows
up
as
well
light
toffee
sweetness
mostly
sour
overall
body
is
solid
appropriate
to
the
style
and
the
carbonation
works
well
with
the
sourness
overall
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
brew
and
this
one
hit
the
spot
its
not
really
blowing
my
mind
and
i
could
do
with
some
more
complexity
but
its
a
solid
beer
if
it
fits
what
youre
looking
for
i
applaud
the
coop
and
matt
and
ashton
for
honestly
getting
in
some
truly
unique
beers
into
the
market
recently
and
especially
in
the
last
year
cheers
to
expanding
boises
palate
feels
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
an
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
a
very
nice
beer
didnt
recognize
it
on
the
beer
list
here
at
maxs
and
thought
id
give
it
a
shot
glad
i
did
ichtegems
grand
cru
tingles
and
pops
the
very
light
carbonation
really
allows
all
the
flavors
and
subtleties
to
be
easily
detected
medium
bodied
with
a
coating
finish
i
wish
i
could
drink
this
rather
often
but
this
one
hurts
the
wallet
at
6
99
a
bottle
for
a
beer
that
is
no
longer
produced
i
guess
it
is
still
a
great
deal
none
the
less
earthy
mushy
fruit
malt
up
front
metallic
cherry
tartness
cuts
in
slightly
sugary
fruit
malt
in
the
background
some
oak
and
vanilla
before
tartness
and
balsamic
vinegar
take
over
lingering
cherry
tartness
and
faint
sweetness
fruit
skins
in
the
finish
nice
different
i
need
to
start
drinking
more
flanders
red
ales
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
subtle
sourness
that
yields
to
the
oak
barrel
aroma
its
well
rounded
with
crystal
and
roasted
malts
very
nice
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
subdued
sour
flavor
that
really
works
well
with
the
oak
aging
its
mellowed
out
and
thus
increases
the
drinkability
the
malt
content
consists
of
some
pale
and
roasted
malts
its
doesnt
appear
to
be
too
sweet
on
the
contrary
its
dry
and
quite
light
in
the
mouthfeel
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequategood
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
i
love
the
oak
contribution
it
tames
the
sourness
to
a
level
that
most
would
enjoy
this
flanders
red
is
not
heavy
at
all
and
it
does
leave
the
mouth
dry
a
nice
sipper
though
with
some
wine
like
qualities
that
one
would
not
expect
in
a
relatively
low
abv
beer
poured
a
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
head
sweet
fruity
aromas
followed
by
a
dose
of
lightly
acetic
sourness
more
sweeet
than
sour
but
only
slightly
there
is
also
a
slight
vegetal
aroma
and
some
dusty
smelling
fruit
the
taste
is
a
little
light
and
once
again
more
on
the
sweet
than
the
sour
side
still
none
of
the
unpleasant
vegetal
odors
manifest
in
th
taste
at
all
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
a
little
too
much
so
overall
this
beer
is
a
little
too
sweet
for
the
style
for
my
taste
and
a
bit
out
of
balance
not
bad
but
there
are
a
number
of
better
options
d
easy
to
drink
but
sadly
nothing
special
disappointing
complex
worth
a
try
maybe
its
just
a
sour
ale
for
beginners
but
i
liked
it
d
i
could
have
gone
for
another
the
boldness
of
this
one
won
me
over
after
i
got
over
the
initial
shock
of
its
peculiarity
overall
this
was
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
really
nice
sour
ale
i
had
not
had
one
in
a
good
while
so
this
was
a
nice
treat
very
nice
presentation
and
aroma
and
the
flavor
more
then
backed
it
up
i
would
gladly
have
another
one
of
these
any
day
it
was
worth
a
shot
perhaps
a
younger
bottle
wouldve
faired
differently
drinkability
definitely
has
some
interesting
components
and
is
very
drinkable
however
it
doesnt
have
as
much
in
the
way
of
sourness
as
others
in
the
style
drinkability
again
a
strange
mix
of
flavors
and
probably
something
you
wont
expect
will
come
ou
of
the
bottle
id
love
to
get
some
more
just
to
see
how
another
bottle
would
compare
i
found
it
to
be
delicious
and
quite
drinkable
the
buttery
texture
and
flavor
is
fun
in
a
sour
beer
cheers
drinkable
needs
more
zing
its
nice
but
it
needs
more
sour
power
not
spectacular
but
quite
interesting
drinkability
yes
sir
itchy
gems
makes
a
pretty
fine
flanders
sour
ale
i
really
enjoy
tart
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
it
is
quite
complex
and
easy
to
drink
but
falls
slightly
shy
of
greatness
nonetheless
those
who
enjoy
this
style
should
certainly
give
this
one
a
try
had
this
on
tap
the
sourness
was
very
unique
i
was
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
sourness
of
this
beer
most
times
i
find
the
sourness
to
be
appealing
but
this
one
i
thought
actually
tasted
metalic
but
after
drinking
more
i
do
not
think
it
was
a
metalic
taste
but
a
weird
aftertase
from
the
sourness
i
didnt
think
it
was
all
that
great
as
a
flanders
red
balance
was
not
there
and
the
complexity
that
i
usually
find
in
flanders
reds
was
severly
lacking
was
able
to
give
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
it
is
a
style
i
really
like
but
very
infrequently
have
so
this
was
a
treat
the
brew
was
poured
to
a
dark
reddish
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
was
medium
in
size
and
left
nice
sheets
of
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
nice
berry
aroma
mostly
cherry
i
believe
along
with
a
slight
vinegar
sourness
that
is
subtle
but
noticeable
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
tart
berry
flavor
to
me
the
berries
come
out
more
clearly
here
with
raspberries
cherries
and
maybe
plum
has
a
sourness
to
it
but
does
not
seem
to
be
a
pronounced
as
in
some
other
flanders
red
offerings
over
all
i
think
that
this
is
a
nice
offering
very
tame
beer
based
on
the
style
which
has
its
good
points
i
would
get
this
brew
again
in
the
future
this
sourness
of
this
one
is
unique
try
it
if
you
like
the
style
for
sure
smell
is
pretty
non
existant
not
as
much
funk
as
i
like
taste
is
very
good
only
a
light
sourness
unfortunately
i
like
to
pucker
but
it
tastes
great
regardless
of
the
sourness
or
lack
thereof
i
could
probably
drink
this
all
afternoon
and
in
fact
may
do
just
that
cheers
this
was
a
strange
one
to
rate
started
off
awesome
big
deep
dark
pour
chunky
meaty
head
smell
was
that
nice
vinegery
sp
bitter
nose
kinda
getting
pumped
because
its
smelling
great
than
the
taste
light
vinegar
big
dry
bitterness
very
dry
but
to
be
honest
it
has
that
rr
supplication
dryness
so
if
you
like
that
mixed
with
a
duchesse
your
pumped
but
for
me
mouthfeel
lost
me
sorry
d
i
can
drink
this
stuff
all
night
long
i
guess
another
trip
to
belgium
is
in
order
d
i
didnt
finish
it
this
is
not
a
good
oud
bruin
there
is
far
too
much
sweetness
and
is
almost
cloying
rather
than
crisp
flavourful
and
tart
bottle
4
99
for
a
11
2oz
bottle
no
date
i
could
find
on
the
bottle
but
the
cap
says
29092014
which
i
am
guessing
is
the
best
by
date
poured
a
fairly
dark
reddish
brown
with
an
offwhite
2
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
down
to
about
a
14
of
an
inch
and
then
just
flat
out
disappears
the
aroma
is
not
sour
at
all
the
nose
is
actually
pretty
bad
not
bad
smelling
but
there
really
isnt
a
whole
lot
there
oh
dear
god
this
is
not
very
good
it
has
a
subtle
bitter
taste
that
is
off
putting
subtle
fruit
taste
not
sour
really
at
all
did
i
say
that
already
cant
imagine
really
finishing
this
one
slight
alcohol
flavor
at
the
end
lightmedium
mouthfeel
i
would
avoid
this
one
especially
at
the
price
tried
again
and
same
results
as
above
overall
not
bad
but
certainly
not
the
best
in
the
style
d
good
example
of
the
style
pleasant
and
drinkable
overall
i
dont
mind
this
but
i
wish
this
was
more
sour
and
more
oak
was
present
it
started
out
drinking
slow
but
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
bottle
it
got
a
little
better
md
very
smooth
the
soft
carbonation
lasts
throughout
the
drink
against
a
mediumplus
body
this
oud
bruin
is
not
quite
stale
like
any
wellaged
ale
or
lacticsourfruity
as
my
last
bottle
bockor
bellegems
bruin
but
more
on
the
sour
candy
it
also
had
a
nice
warming
feel
as
it
went
down
the
throat
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
the
alcohol
isnt
very
strong
in
it
this
looked
just
like
a
glass
of
wine
strong
dark
fruit
aroma
with
hints
of
balsamic
vinegar
a
little
hint
of
a
wineoak
aroma
as
well
this
beer
tastes
almost
exactly
like
it
smells
initially
it
was
a
pleasant
sour
vinegar
flavor
with
some
nice
dark
grape
flavors
after
the
initial
blast
of
sour
was
a
perfectly
balanced
oak
wood
flavor
slightly
sweet
too
sooo
delicious
sometimes
i
find
wood
flavors
to
be
a
little
overwhelming
but
this
was
great
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
very
drinkable
as
i
had
three
of
them
that
night
beerhonkymar
23
it
would
improve
the
beer
immensely
still
dark
orange
moderate
carb
smell
of
oak
and
cherries
taste
unfortunately
is
muted
whiskey
barrel
flavor
no
fruit
bitter
finish
may
have
been
better
fresh
most
likely
was
medium
body
decent
simply
terrible
overpriced
over
hyped
and
yet
another
crppy
italian
beer
very
interesting
beer
and
lots
of
complexity
to
explore
there
are
very
strong
whiskey
and
wine
flavours
in
this
brew
and
lots
of
fruitiness
which
makes
for
a
very
enjoyable
drink
despite
the
sourness
and
slightly
dodgy
smell
it
was
a
very
enjoyable
drink
definitely
the
lighter
side
of
the
oud
bruin
genre
much
more
lemony
lacto
than
dark
malt
in
here
there
is
almost
no
roast
character
to
the
grain
at
all
i
taste
no
chocolate
malt
either
more
like
a
soured
copper
ale
smells
and
tastes
about
the
same
less
dynamic
or
intriguing
than
the
other
loverbeer
stuff
but
loaded
with
sourness
the
oak
is
there
in
the
nose
but
it
does
little
to
temper
the
intense
lactic
acidity
in
the
swallow
grain
profile
seems
too
light
for
the
style
and
too
light
for
the
texture
its
maybe
a
summer
oud
bruin
if
such
a
thing
exists
but
i
think
it
lacks
a
little
depth
on
the
malt
front
despite
tasting
delicious
it
really
pops
on
the
palate
too
effervescent
carbonation
makes
it
drink
right
down
lingering
dried
fruit
and
oak
on
the
palate
is
neat
for
such
a
light
bodied
beer
too
definitely
the
most
sour
beer
ive
had
from
loverbeer
but
also
the
least
unique
well
made
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
especially
at
this
price
pleased
i
had
it
but
one
was
enough
i
had
this
with
fruit
and
cheese
and
it
was
a
nice
complement
to
the
food
the
price
is
the
only
negative
factor
here
i
would
not
pay
1516
dollars
for
this
beer
othis
is
a
pretty
good
take
on
an
oud
bruin
the
oak
is
very
obvious
and
this
is
a
complex
brew
but
found
it
a
little
too
malty
and
earthy
when
compared
against
the
best
examples
of
the
style
the
interesting
thing
was
that
despite
the
earthiness
the
beer
was
still
pretty
acidic
odd
anyway
a
good
beer
but
probably
not
worth
the
steep
price
overall
pleasant
and
good
but
probably
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
for
me
to
buy
it
again
more
damp
musty
wood
in
the
flavor
cant
say
it
really
works
in
the
beers
favor
though
it
can
be
a
potentially
positive
trait
in
the
right
amount
mild
tartness
fruity
with
a
touch
of
cherry
it
finishes
dry
and
fairly
nondescript
kind
of
just
drops
off
pretty
unimpressed
by
this
and
for
the
price
i
probably
wont
be
returning
to
loverbeers
lineup
any
time
soon
there
are
far
better
oud
bruins
out
there
pour
is
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
nose
is
dusty
and
leathery
with
a
strong
tart
cherry
and
light
acetic
acid
taste
is
the
same
but
less
vibrant
and
bright
a
little
thin
and
watery
in
the
finish
with
a
touch
of
peppery
spice
lingering
body
is
light
and
soft
lower
carbonation
and
an
oily
finish
bottle
poured
a
deep
reddish
color
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
consists
of
oak
with
light
tart
cherries
note
with
a
light
acidic
edge
and
some
sour
notes
taste
is
a
well
balanced
mix
between
some
oak
with
good
notes
of
sour
cherries
with
light
acidic
notes
body
is
about
average
for
style
with
good
carbonation
well
brewed
with
nice
complexity
while
retaining
a
good
drinkability
level
madamin
is
a
masterfully
brewed
and
melded
ale
that
makes
me
want
to
taste
more
sourness
and
earth
flavor
but
even
those
characteristics
in
this
ale
is
more
daft
than
is
typical
for
oud
bruins
medium
bodieswith
a
tart
puckering
mouthfeel
thats
decently
tartsour
without
becoming
overly
acidicacetic
lots
of
toasted
oak
sweet
malt
and
vinous
fruit
for
balance
vinegar
acetic
quality
throughout
but
its
cut
by
vanilla
sweetness
and
dryness
from
the
oak
sweet
malts
provide
nice
balance
along
with
vinous
grape
a
strong
tart
cherry
presence
and
other
dark
fruits
the
pour
is
amber
in
color
with
an
offwhite
head
rather
sweet
aroma
for
a
sour
beer
lots
of
berries
and
grapes
with
a
strange
butterscotch
sweetness
too
quite
a
lot
of
strawberry
flavor
on
the
palate
which
is
actually
enjoyable
mild
to
moderate
tartness
and
acidity
a
little
bit
of
oak
and
straw
and
very
high
carbonation
despite
the
sweetness
of
the
aroma
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
pours
a
figgy

a

nutty
interesting
up
front
cherry
moderately
tart
and
slightly
sweet
the
yeast
character
is
in
here
as
well
kinda
suits
the
sweetness
a
bit
and
offers
a
more
complex
approach
to
the
style
than
many
oud
bruins
ive
had
seems
to
cut
the
oak
dryness
and
bitterness
i
sometimes
experience
and
dislike
in
the
style
full
bodied
and
almost
creamy
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
an
interesting
beer
and
nice
to
try
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
great
treat
that
i
find
has
exceptional
balance
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
vain
are
overly
sweet
and
vinegary
this
has
a
great
balance
of
tart
fruit
and
grains
love
it
and
perfect
for
a
hot
afternoon
in
nola
poured
a
clear
copperbrown
color
with
a
small
feisty
head
you
get
some
good
lacto
sourness
in
the
nose
followed
by
mild
malt
and
fruit
flavors
the
taste
is
a
bit
less
sour
than
the
smell
a
more
mild
and
pleasant
version
of
the
lacto
funkiness
with
some
berry
fruitiness
emerging
mouthfeel
was
mild
and
pleasant
again
with
medium
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
good
tart
and
lacto
character
o
overall
this
beer
started
out
so
good
very
nice
appearance
and
aromas
but
really
really
falls
flat
on
taste
and
mouthfeel
such
a
disappointment
pours
a
murky
chestnutmahogany
with
a
thin
white
head
sour
and
funk
on
the
the
nose
semi
sweet
fruits
faintly
shine
through
sour
apples
a
bit
of
grain
and
sour
cherries
lots
of
sugar
on
the
tongue
and
finishes
on
a
wood
or
nut
like
note
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
very
sour
and
tart
overall
this
is
a
good
sour
way
to
pricy
in
my
opinion
but
not
a
bad
drink
at
all
othis
is
a
really
good
beer
is
the
price
justified
no
not
really
after
the
first
few
sips
the
complexity
loses
itself
even
though
thats
true
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
drink
all
the
way
through
every
sip
is
quite
enjoyable
this
is
an
average
example
of
this
style
poured
a
hazy
dark
mahogany
brown
with
a
small
dense
cap
of
beige
head
that
retained
and
laced
moderately
aroma
was
light
with
notes
of
fruit
and
funk
taste
was
nice
and
full
of
nonthreatening
sourness
a
bit
acidic
a
bit
funky
notes
of
cherry
and
peach
and
red
wine
woody
and
leafy
midpalate
with
a
drying
finish
lightmedium
body
went
down
very
easy
and
was
quite
enjoyable
the
beer
has
a
slightly
sweetsour
nose
but
nothing
that
knocks
your
socks
off
the
taste
is
a
rather
reserved
a
little
funk
and
generic
oud
bruin
flavors
ie
sour
cherries
and
such
nothing
is
too
pronounced
except
the
carbonation
which
is
almost
excessive
and
therefore
it
seems
to
have
relatively
good
balance
this
beer
wasnt
disappointing
but
id
rather
try
other
things
next
time
instead
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
that
cost
again
tends
to
bring
my
assesment
down
even
though
it
shouldnt
but
hey
i
am
not
made
of
money
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
brownish
amber
with
pretty
good
head
retention
and
light
lacing
really
dont
get
a
whole
lot
on
the
nose
just
some
light
sour
funk
and
underlying
cherry
the
flavor
profile
replicates
the
nose
but
has
a
bit
more
to
it
the
beer
actually
has
considerable
sour
at
least
for
me
that
marries
well
with
the
fruit
and
wheat
flavor
im
picking
up
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
drinkability
is
definitely
high
while
i
wish
this
beer
had
a
bit
more
flavor
its
not
terrible
and
in
fact
is
fairly
enjoyable
the
low
alcohol
is
a
definite
bonus
a
very
different
tasting
flanders
oud
bruin
kind
of
neat
rather
enjoyed
it
on
tap
at
churchkey
poured
into
sampler
glass
pours
hazy
medium
to
dark
amber
beer
with
a
fizzy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
malty
very
lightly
hoppy
lightly
to
moderately
yeasty
with
notes
of
grape
oak
cherries
perhaps
a
touch
of

and
citric
fruits
the

not

just
sweet
sour
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
but
for
the
cost20
dollars
for
an
11
oz
bottle
i
would
rather
drink
a
cantillon
note
2010
vintage
another
subtle
sour
from
italy
cloudy
amber
with
surprisingly
long
head
retention
but
no
lace
lots
of
oak

sour

in
the
aroma

is

and
a
touch
of

light

and
lively
carbonation
some
malt
in
the
middle
and
light
hop
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
d
overall
a
very
good
sour
beer
heavy
on
taste
and
light
on
mouthfeel
characteristics
smooth
and
easy
to
consume
would
go
great
with
some
strong
flavorful
food
like
pasta
with
anchovies
and
capers
a
bit
of
sourness
in
the
end
overall
this
was
a
very
solid
beer
complex
with
everything
present
in
very
good
levels
well
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
around
overall
im
not
a
sour
beer
fan
however
this
must
be
my
favorite
likely
due
to
the
fact
it
is
barrel
aged
and
the
bottle
itself
is
aged
roughly
17
months
poured
ontap
at
the
brewery
and
served
in
a
tulip
the
beer
is
a
ruby
brown
coloring
with
a
tan
halo
of
head
nose
of
dark
cherry
oak
old
world
fruit
booze
and
tart
sweetness
flavors
are
tangy
caramel
tart
cherry
merlot
characteristics
woody
highlights
and
a
subtle
acidic
note
robust
and
fullbodied
the
aftertaste
is
tart
cherry
all
over
with
some
merlot
and
cabarnet
notes
with
a
dry
lingering
tart
finish
heavy
brew
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
with
malt
fruit
and
acidic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sour
malt
fruit
and
acidic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
acidity
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
pleasant
sourness
all
around
some
of
the
best
stuff
to
come
out
from
funkwerks
and
thats
really
saying
something
as
all
of
their
beer
is
outstanding
just
getting
into
sours
this
beer
is
quality
beyond
their
newness
lighter
brown
in
color
with
some
amber
hues
and
a
soda
head
of
clearish
tan
bubbles
the
nose
is
tart
as
it
is
sour
with
a
richer
malt
base
consisting
of
chocolate
malt
amongst
others
not
sweet
but
with
a
little
richness
to
it
there
is
a
lot
of
acid
too
which
pulls
me
from
grain
to
yeast
almost
fruity
in
nature
citric
and
lactic
at
the
same
time
subtle
but
leading
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
nose
although
the
acid
is
more
forward
than
indicated
its
all
the
way
through
not
just
in
the
finish
and
the
carbonation
being
so
bright
makes
it
really
come
alive
dry
in
the
finish
even
though
there
is
some
heft
to
the
darker
grain
its
all
gone
on
the
swallow
as
carbonated
as
they
come
its
fizzy
and
almost
loud
in
the
mouth
i
hope
funkwerks
keeps
up
with
the
sours
this
is
a
heck
of
a
way
to
make
a
splash
in
that
world
i
wish
this
was
a
little
more
available
than
it
is
but
a
really
nice
american
made
example
of
the
style
othis
is
a
pretty
decent
attempt
at
a
tough
style
a
little
bit
more
sourtartness
would
have
paired
well
with
the
earthy
flavors
but
even
lacking
the
pucker
factor
i
found
this
beer
growing
on
me
as
i
finished
my
first
glass
and
poured
my
second
it
manages
to
be
complex
but
approachable
a
nice
take
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
overall
im
extremely
bummed
i
didnt
get
another
one
of
these
to
see
how
it
ages
but
im
licking
my
chops
to
see
what
funkwerks
can
do
with
their
next
attempt
at
a
barrelaged
sour
overall
a
nice
sour
i
like
the
subtle
sour
and
cherry
but
its
a
little
thin
and
too
dry
and
acidic
for
me
the
longer
it
sits
the
more
bandaid
notes
come
out
pours
a
brown
with
a
mahogany
hue
and
a
khaki
head
that
leaves
very
nice
lacing
on
sides
aroma
offers
some
pomegranate
and
plum
some
vinegar
coffee
cake
caramel
and
woody
flavor
starts
off
with
the
dark
fruits
which
is
then
disrupted
by
some
vinegar
theres
also
some
caramel
and
brown
sugar
a
good
does
of
some
breadiness
and
it
closes
out
with
the
woodiness
that
offers
a
little
bitter
in
the
finish
more
mildy
sour
than
moderate
a
fuller
heavy
mouthfeel
overall
funkwerks
with
another
winner
would
definitely
drink
this
again
not
for
everyday
drinking
has
some
nice
elements
but
it
doesnt
quite
have
as
much
balance
as
others
of
the
style
ive
had
d
a
bit
empty
and
rough
needs
a
bit
more
depth
and
complexity
for
the
style
poured
a
brownish
color
with
no
lingering
head
to
three
philosphers
stemmed
wear
smell
is
pungently
sour
upon
being
poured
vinegar
red
grapes
cherry
and
wood
i
think
the
nose
was
my
favorite
part
of
this
the
taste
is
obviously
acidic
very
sweet
cherries
red
grapes
some
oak
tannins
the
most
off
putting
part
is
an
almost
ashtray
like
flavor
not
a
fan
and
very
evident
mouthfeel
is
like
red
wine
like
minimal
carbonation
almost
flat
like
i
enjoy
a
lot
of
sours
and
i
think
one
falls
somewhere
near
the
bottom
in
overall
enjoyment
overall
without
the
urine
smell
and
the
cough
syrup
taste
i
think
that
this
beer
would
be
really
good
the
off
flavors
and
smell
really
hurt
this
beer
the
most
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
but
to
each
his
own
i
would
pass
on
this
beer
if
i
were
you
glad
this
was
a
bottle
that
was
given
to
me
i
might
have
gotten
mad
at
myself
if
i
had
bought
this
beer
a
decent
beer
i
like
the
way
the
fruit
comes
together
with
the
acid
overall
it
doesnt
really
work
it
has
such
weirdnesses
to
it
that
arent
integrated
or
explained
with
the
other
characters
or
as
a
whole
probably
one
of
my
least
favourite
sours
i
really
am
enjoying
this
its

mikkeller
stemmed
tulip
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wood
vinegar
tart
and
subtle
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
peat
dark
fruit
tart
vinegar
and
wood
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
really
have
to
be
honest
that
i
did
not
expect
this
one
to
have
a
peat
characteristic
in
it
usually
i
despise
peat
but
this
one
actually
incorporates
it
fairly
well
with
the
tartvinegar
aspect
going
on
really
wish
there
were
a
little
more
sweetness
going
on
in
this
one
let
this
one
warm
up
and
the
vinegar
tone
isnt
as
abrasive
just
a
hint
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
but
thats
about
it
o
a
solid
brew
the
flavor
profile
is
very
nice
i
wish
some
of
the
malts
were
a
bit
richer
but
overall
it
is
a
good
brew
i
wish
the
price
was
a
little
lower
but
worth
trying
o
down
the
drain
this
went
for
mike
scott
and
myself
i
just
learned
that
this
one
cost
26
what
you
crazy
this
must
be
a

pours
a

color
with
a
wisp
of
a

and
little

a
film
does
sit
on
top
for
a
while
aroma
light
with
vinegar
stone
fruit
cherry
pie
and
damp
rotting
wood
tastes
much
of
the
same
but
in
a
less
bad
way
than
the
smell
body
and
palate
was
pretty
good
smooth
silky
and
nicely
low
carbonated
overall
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
as
there
was
not
enough
funk
in
some
areas
too
sweet
in
others
and
a
bit
of
a
mess
in
yet
some
more
i
will
say
this
though
it
may
be
a
decent
introductory
to
someone
who
has
never
tried
the
style
as
it
is
mild
with
many
of
the
different
flavors
that
are
usually
found
in
the
style
d
decent
drinkability
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
probably
pair
well
with
an
insalata
caprese
if
you
love
sours
steer
clear
of
this
its
not
worth
the
price
o
just
ok
somewhat
of
a
balance
problem
sour
start
but
then
super
sweet
finish
price
is
just
way
too
high
overall
a
decent
flanders
but
not
one
that
has
tremendous
complexity
or
staying
power
i
would
suspect
yes
my
children
huge
initial
punch
of
sourness
that
fades
rather
quickly
not
a
large
cherry
or
wine
flavor
has
a
flanders
red
tannic
quality
to
it
pours
a
murky
honey

that
dissipates
to
fine
lacing
around
edge
of
glass
lots
of
oak
and
sweetsour
cherries
on
the
nose
taste
is
perfect
combination
of
sweet
oaky
flavors
and
sour
tartness
really
a
nice
long
finish
as
well
doesnt
overwhelm
with
sour
and
can
really
tell
the
cherries
are
there
really
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
expected
too
would
highly
recommend
very
tart
and
cherry
forward
verging
on
sour
drying
oak
in
the
finish
sour
cherries
linger
long
in
the
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
with
a
very
light
acetic
presence
thats
perfectly
acceptable
for
the
style
sour
cherry
for
days
if
you
like
la
folie
this
is
even
more
interesting
a
very
elegant
beer
not
quite
what
i
would
call
an
oud
bruin
but
much
to
appreciate
in
this
brew
as
far
as
style
fusions
are
concerned
it
has
a
faded
dark
red
look
to
it
auburn
maybe
without
much
head
at
all
just
some
light
khaki
fizz
around
the
edges
of
my
wine
glass
not
overly
appealing
it
looks
like
one
of
those
fruited
lambics
almost
still
and
cloudy
the
nose
is
great
though
tons
of
tartness
and
its
sour
before
it
is
cherry
although
the
fruit
in
this
is
right
up
front
too
sweet
and
then
tart
are
the
cherries
like
pie
cherries
they
are
carries
on
by
a
really
funky
yeast
which
is
a
cool
combination
a
little
familiar
but
also
unique
to
this
beer
alone
perennial
does
a
lot
of
that
and
its
always
appreciated
the
base
beer
itself
is
a
bit
confusing
not
quite
dark
or
sour
enough
to
be
an
oud
bruin
maybe
closer
to
a
flanders
red
ale
but
again
that
lactic
sourness
is
too
subtle
in
this
beer
it
almost
tastes
like
a
blend
but
i
dont
think
its
that
either
very
enjoyable
whatever
it
is
with
the
cherries
drying
up
in
the
finish
hard
to
tell
if
its
sour
from
a
bacterial
sort
of
fermentation
or
if
its
just
from
cherry
juice
alone
it
could
almost
be
either
the
red
wine
barrel
aging
likely
also
muddles
just
exactly
gives
it
its
tartness
and
moderate
acidity
puzzling
but
wonderfully
crafted
a
little
expensive
at
over
20
bucks
on
the
shelf
but
a
very
cool
beer
to
try
thanks
to
drlovemd87
for
bringing
this
one
over
it
was
my
girlfriends
favorite
beer
in
a
night
that
featured
many
greats
750ml
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
aroma
of
funk
sour
cherry
wine
hazy
reddish
brown
pour
with
a
beige
head
that
faded
quickly
minimal
lacing
flavor
of
tart
sour
cherry
red
wine
wood
subtle
chocolate
sourness
lessened
as
it
warmed
in
the
glass
finish
is
a
touch
hot
nicely
done
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
that
i
wish
was
more
readily
available
as
a
flanders
oud
bruin
its
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
ive
seen
it
listed
as
a
fruit
lambic
kriek
a
flanders
red
an
oud
bruin
and
even
an
american
wild
there
seems
to
be
so
much
grey
area
between
those
styles
either
way
its
a
beer
that
i
will
make
a
point
to
drink
anytime
i
come
across
it
just
outstanding
stuff
from
perennial
pour
is
brown
with
red
edges
and
a
tight
light
brown
head
nose
is
strange
bready
and
dough
malts
abound
a
bit
musky
some
sour
cherry
behind
but
light
taste
is
more
tart
cherry
than
the
nose
the
musky
bread
is
there
very
strange
light
leathery
brett
mid
palate
rather
full
bodied
with
a
strong
carbonation
the
flavor
is
incredible
such
a
well
crafted
brew
starts
off
with
tight
and
noticeable
notes
of
balsamic
vinegar
tartness
this
tartness
is
quickly
followed
by
some
tartness
imparted
by
the
cherries
oh
the
cherries
what
and
amazing
facet
of
this
brew
they
are
tart
and
puckering
but
at
the
same
time
have
a
sugary
jam
quality
to
them
that
balances
out
the
tartness
that
could
potentially
overwhelm
this
brew
there
are
some
nice
buttery
pie
crust
notes
that
are
perceived
as
well
potentially
from
the
yeast
notes
and
the
grains
soo
delicious
there
are
some
nice
dry
vinous
notes
that
work
so
well
with
the
tartness
and
lend
the
beer
some
more
mild
dark
fruit
sweetness
as
well
as
some
dryness
the
body
is
perfectly
light
and
dry
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
that
let
the
flavors
shine
through
solid
brew
in
my
book
hunt
this
beer
down
the
beer
pours
a
clearslightly
hazy
dark
rusty
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fizzles
into
an
even
thinner
white
halo
shortly
after
pouring
the
nose
is
a
mild
acetone
cherries
caramel
sweetness
and
bread
however
upon
tasting
the
beer
the
flavor
is
more
reminiscent
of
tart
cranberry
and
pear
upfront
which
transitions
into
a
deeper
berryester
sweetness
and
finishes
dry
with
a
hint
of
cherry
im
really
digging
the
modest
drinkable
sour
mouthfeel
with
a
fruity
bready
tart
finish
that
doesnt
get
tired
or
overwhelming
its
a
bit
more
sour
than
most
flanders
but
it
doesnt
lay
down
the
heavy
acetone
or
slap
you
in
the
face
with
cherries
this
is
a
blatantly
delicious
beer
one
of
the
best
flanders
ive
had
awesome
for
the
style
havent
had
anything
much
like
it
before
not
very
sour
but
balanced
some
slight
off
flavors
overall
despite
the
vomittomatowateryness
i
actually
loved
it
kidding
horrible
two
thumbs
way
down
i
would
turn
down
a
taster
of
this
every
single
time
rich
reddish
brown
body
with
minimal
white
head
2nd
bottling
from
spring
2013
definitely
some
acidity
on
the
nose
not
much
else
on
the
nose
nice
malty
body
that
helps
round
out
the
tartness
the
beer
is
pretty
one
note
in
terms
of
acidity
but
the
flanders
body
is
there
not
a
bad
flanders
but
not
very
complex
o
fff
can
do
hoppy
beers
they
can
do
stouts
and
then
can
do
germanstyle
beers
however
they
cant
do
sours
until
i
try
one
thats
half
way
decent
im
sticking
to
my
opinion
pass
d
this
isnt
very
good
i
almost
wish
it
was
offensively
bad
rather
than
bland
as
itd
give
me
more
party
conversation
material
a
very
dull
beer
with
an
unpleasant
finish
literally
tastes
like
a
homebrewers
first
attempt
at
a
sour
brown
overall
not
impressed
here
o
terrible
i
love
zombie
dust
and
dreadnaught
and
alpha
king
and
behemoth
and
others
from
three
floyds
but
every
sour
that
ive
had
from
them
has
been
not
good
stick
to
the
hops
sorry
im
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
this
or
stache
o
an
ok
from
fff
not
overly
complex
by
any
standards
but
it
is
easily
drinkable
and
the
flavors
mesh
well
tastes
like
it
smells
way
lots
of
smooth
brandy
and
vanilla
against
a
mediumstrength
vinegary
sourness
with
some
nice
herbs
backing
everything
up
the
flavor
is
light
when
compared
to
most
other
fff
bas
but
its
super
duper
tasty
overall
i
didnt
quite
expect
this
beer
to
be
anything
like
this
the
name
and
label
points
towards
a
beer
dominated
by
wild
yeast
and
barrel
character
but
what
it
turns
out
to
be
is
a
refreshing
and
crisp
kolsch
with
influences
by
wild
yeast
and
cypress
nice
touch
to
a
good
base
beer
o
i
found
myself
surpsised
with
this
beer
twice
at
first
i
was
surprised
at
the
level
of
funk
presence
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
this
was
a
disappointing
surpsise
as
i
sipped
through
i
was
equally
surprised
at
how
this
beer
grew
on
me
i
would
not
say
it
overwhelms
on
any
level
i
will
say
that
it
is
very
drinkable
and
one
that
i
ended
up
enjoying
quite
a
bit
a
bit
weak
no
complexity
to
enjoy
but
a
decent
sour

i

oooh
you
see

ill

shudder
again

the

mouthwatering

has
good

no
brett
smells
no
big
fruitiness
in
the
taste
it
has
a
helping
of
malt
that
is
rare
to
find
sourness
is
pleasant
to
hide
but
lacking
a
flavor
complexity
carbonation
seemed
a
little
on
the
low
side
for
the
style
im
glad
to
have
shared
this
one
o
not
bad
but
theres
better
out
there
pretty
low
on
the
sourness
but
not
bad
for
somebody
that
doesnt
want
to
jump
in
all
the

quite
yet

the

more
malty
than
anything
with
a
definite
alcohol
flavor
which
is
odd
in
a
beer
with
such
a
low
abv
its
earthy
and
a
little
sweet
muthfeel
has
a
sort
of
winey
vibe
to
it
not
acidic
at
all
but
the
same
sort
of
groove
and
texture
add
carbonation
overall
not
my
favorite
beer
certainly
not
my
favorite
belgian
but
a
servicable
belgian
brown
was
expecting
a
bit
more
sour
to
it
but
really
there
is
very
little
of
that
happening
here
overall
im
a
little
disappointed
i
was
ready
for
a
really
good
oud
bruin
after
the
nose
and
it
pretty
much
fell
flat
on
its
face
m
thin
watery
body
medium
carbonation
at
least
the
carbonation
isnt
supercharged
and
distracting
like
the
other
timmermans
in
this
session
body
seems
a
bit
watery
a
session
brune
if
thats
what
youre
after
overall
is
this
the
bmc
of
flanders
oud
bruin
not
sure
but
enjoying
the
cherry
coke
would
pick
this
up
again
if
it
was
a
buck
a
piece
great
intro
for
people
not
into
beers
especially
if
they
like
sodas
taste
similar
some
tartness
from
berries
and
cherries
and
roasted
malts
sweetness
pours
a
rich
brown
color
nice
sized
head
and
some
lace
sticking
aroma
of
sour
cherries
and
vinegar
in
the
taste
malty
slightly
sweet
with
a
veritable
underground
of
sourness
brown
sugar
like
sweetness
mildly
tart
and
somewhat
malty
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
overall
a
nice
flanders
brown
ale
and
a
solid
session
change
of
pace
brew
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
what
i
would
hope
for
in
this
style
there
are
enough
other
better
and
available
beers
in
this
style
that
are
more
satisfying
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
750ml

no

an

dark
brwon

with
beatiful
reddish
hints

the

good
beige
creamy

with

is
very
acidic
with
fruits
cherry
specially
wood
caramel
and
brettanomyces
it
feels
good
on
the
tongue
although
a
bit
light
taste
is
acidic
fruity
sherry
wine
and
brattanomyces
are
there
if
this
beer
had
more
of
the
expected
sourness
i
would
have
given
much
higher
marks
on
taste
and
overall
i
really
like
the
style
this
one
just
falls
short
overall
this
is
kind
of
a
weird
beer
overall
not
really
one
id
seek
out
again
a
poor
example
of
a
flanders
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
cherry
beer
this
is
fine
not
a
problem
to
drink
but
id
like
some
complexity
and
at
least
some
sort
of
tartsour
bite
the
beer
was
cola
colored
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
it
smells
like
sour
cherry
cola
with
just
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
oak
the
taste
is
a
little
more
complex
with
sweet
cola
black
cherry
molasses
and
a
tart
finish
the
beer
is
lighter
than
it
looks
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
good
and
interesting
beer
proof
that
you
cant
trust
all
overall
ratings
on
here
not
bad
for
the
style
but
certainly
not
anything
to
write
home
about
while
the
malts
are
nicely
balanced
with
the
tartness
lots
of
prune
and
grape
right
up
front
with
sour
cherry
and
sweet
malty
backbone
the
flavor
overall
is
a
little
thin
thats
really
the
only
major
complaintthe
sweetness
and
maltiness
seem
so
balanced
because
theres
really
no
dominant
flavor
in
the
beer
similar
to
a
slightly
watery
petrus
oud
bruin
but
with
dissipated
complexity
nevertheless
its
always
nice
to
be
drinking
a
barrelaged
belgian
future
outlook
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
theres
no
real
reason
to
purchase
again
o
i
regret
spending
10
on
this
never
again
the
real
bruin
brewers
in
belgium
would
roll
their
eyes
at
this
typical
brown
ale
thats
that
the
back
says
my
ass
overall
this
beer
was
unpleasantly
sweet
i
repeat
odd
i
bought
this
because
it
was
a
brown
ale
and
english
andor
american
brown
ales
i
typically
like
however
this
is
hardly
a
brown
ale
in
either
of
the
sense
of
those
two
types
it
says
belgian
brown
ale
on
the
bottle
and
its
clasified
aas
flanders
oud
bruin
not
sure
on
all
these
other
names
i
am
from
the
united
states
just
didnt
taste
good
to
me
tasted
sour
and
there
was
little
other
flavor
to
it
very
one
note
on
this
one
which
was
a
bad
note
unless
you
like
sour
though
i
think
this
might
be
because
of
the
style
however
i
still
believe
they
should
have
labeled
this
something
else
which
is
why
i
am
writing
a
review
if
you
like
browns
you
probably
wont
like
this
p
s
reading
up
i
see
that
this
is
a
unique
beer
produced
by
mixing
a
lambic
with
a
high
fermentation
brown
ale
infusion
of
lambic
which
is
then
aged
for
6
months
in
oak
barrels
nothing
spectacular
but
certainly
something
id
get
again
when
i
have
a
sweet
tooth
or
need
something
mild
plus
because
of
the
fairly
low
octane
its
a
nice
item
at
belgian
restaurants
when
youre
driving
too
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
consists
of
some
toffee
malt
but
nothing
else
the
flavor
is
toffee
malt
with
some
light
cherry
notes
and
some
brown
sugar
i
get
no
sourness
or
not
tartness
disappointing
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
nothing
really
interesting
with
this
beer
and
not
really
worth
seeking
out
unless
you
just
need
the
tick
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
very
slight
white
head
the
smell
is
of
a
candied
sour
cherry
its
not
exactly
a
beer
smell
the
taste
is
similar
the
sourness
is
there
but
a
little
muted
and
the
sweetness
seems
to
take
a
lot
more
from
sugar
than
from
malt
thin
and
a
little
watery
in
body
with
a
decent
bitterness
and
sour
pucker
at
the
finish
all
in
all
this
is
a
real
dismantlement
for
the
style
d
this
is
a
interesting
take
on
the
style
a
little
more
carbonated
than
what
i
am
use
to
there
is
a
over
the
top
sweetness
that
destroys
any
of
the
sourness
that
could
be
in
this
beer
overall
a
lackluster
beer
in
the
style
average
at
best
well
maybe
a
little
under
average
i
liked
it
not
bad
at
all
but
im
going
back
to
my
cask
elissa
after
this
good
velvety
mouthfeel
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
however
i
believe
this
could
have
a
bit
more
discernible
carbonation
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
there
certainly
are
better
choices
out
there
this
beer
pours
a
nice
deep
reddish
to
cedar
colour
off
white
head
with
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
of
cherries
and
some
bready
malt
noticeable
belgian
yeast
the
taste
starts
off
sour
cherries
to
me
and
finishes
with
a
sweet
candied
sugar
malt
i
pick
up
a
metallic
like
taste
about
mid
palate
not
sure
what
thats
about
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
semi
dry
this
would
be
a
good
introductory
sour

as

one

and
honestly
the
most
boring
oud
bruin
that
i
have
had
the
misfortune
of
purchasing
i
will
not
be
buying
any
of
the
timmermans
lambics
as
i
assume
i
will
be
equally
disappointed
m
d
i
didnt
find
this
to
be
all
that
bad
but
i
would
probably
be
more
likely
to
reach
for
monks
cafe
duchesse
rodenbach
etc
if
i
were
looking
for
the
style
i
would
be
very
open
to
trying
another
in
regards
to
the
flavour
profile
though
as
it
seems
very
unusual
d
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
i
would
consider
it
to
be
sessionable
if
it
had
a
little
more
sourness
to
balance
out
the
sweet
flavors
notes
when
i
first
saw
this
beer
i
was
hoping
i
finally
found
a
replacement
for
goudenband
its
no
goudenband
though
though
reasonably
tasty
it
isnt
very
complex
and
in
my
opinion
isnt
sour
enough
it
may
be
useful
for
someone
whos
trying
to
ease
into
sours
but
i
cant
recommend
it
otherwise
the
flavor
is
sweet
no
sign
of
funk
rather
pedestrian
this
is
a
beginners
bruin
as
a
seasoned
drinker
i
dont
even
recognize
this
as
an
oud
bruin
more
like
a
belgian
amber
ala
biere
du
boucaneer
we
feel
the
oud
bruin
nose
that
is
to
say
tannins
and
fruit
with
a
touch
more
style
caramelized
cinnamon
biscuit
the
problem
is
that
the
mouth
is
too
yeasted
and
that
input
is
far
too
timid
and
unobtrusive
compared
to
its
big
sisters
like
goudenband
especially
acidity
here
is
far
from
sharp
almost
to
the
limit
the
nonexistent
looks
like
a
mix
between
a
beast
and
a
brown
belgian
oud
bruin
low
quality
the
taste
of
tannin
is
also
rejected
by
the
addition
of
a
dye
unpleasant
in
the
end
even
the
finish
is
below
with
a
taste
between
toasted
malt
and
the
dye
what
a
shame
overall
tasted
like
if
they
made
a
flanders
version
of
coke
and
i
mean
that
in
worst
possible
way
this
is
my
first
example
of
this
style
and
it
strikes
me
as
somewhere
between
a
french
biere
de
garde
and
a
belgian
bruin
strange
drink
probably
not
as
beerlike
as
others
but
enjoyable
overall
an
average
oud
bruin
it
was
hurt
by
the
watery
aspects
in
it
avail
here
in
tx
not
many
oud
bruins
available
here
so
would
get
the
rare
bottle
if
all
i
can
find
ro
a
boring
oud
bruin
that
should
not
be
drank
if
your
expecting
a
typical
sour
d
fine
krieksodaish
ran
into
a
lot
of
this
type
of
oud
bruin
in
poland
a
darker
ester
enhanced
by
heavy
handed
sugaring
that
has
an
alternative
fruity
flavor
this
poured
amber
cherry
clear
makes
me
think
this
was
a
brown
with
a
ton
of
sugar
brought
to
a
heavy
boil
the
only
flavor
this
beer
has
is
in
the
unfermentables
the
rest
is
candy
a
dark
fruit
synthetic
amalgamation
a
hint
of
tang
predominately
blackberry
some
malt
but
guilded
in
sugar
this
is
garbage
and
i
dont
say
that
easily
its
an
insult
to
traditional
flanders
ale
and
represents
the
sugary
watered
down
wine
coolerification
of
traditionally
sour
belgian
styles
out
of
40
oud
bruin
reviews
this
was
the
worst
d
it
was
ok
as
a
novelty
but
i
wouldnt
drink
this
regularly
exceptional
brew
with
a
tart
flavor
exceptionally
delicious
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
and
i
didnt
think
there
was
anything
that
was
off
or
out
of
place
about
this
beer
it
was
just
a
tasty
example
of
the
style
this
beer
has
nice
drinkability
its
smooth
slightly
refreshing
a
little
crisp
not
acidic
at
all
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
one
glass
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
really
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
it
was
nothing
there
wasnt
anything
i
disliked
or
would
change
i
would
recommend
this
beer
especially
if
you
like
the
style
i
would
buy
it
again
but
i
dont
think
i
would
cellar
it
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
just
about
everything
that
i
want
in
the
style
but
i
thought
it
was
still
just
a
notch
below
rodenbach
its
not
a
favorite
from
this
brewery
or
a
favorite
for
the
style
good

if
you
like
them
try
this
one
for
me
not
again
enjoy
o
very
good
but
a
bit
tame
i
would
like
to
know
what
a
fresher
bottle
tastes
like
since
this
seems
to
have
become
a
little
too
toned
down
while
sitting
o
the
combination
of
sour
nose
tart
first

and

does
not

i
was
all
set
to
love
this
beer
but
im
not
particularly
enjoying
it
it
goes
down
easier
with
small
sips
judging
by
some
other
views
i
wonder
if
this
was
a
bad
bottle
o
unfortunately
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
oak
barrel
comes
through
really
well
though
but
i
couldnt
get
past
the
greasy
heavy
mouthfeel
decent
flavors
but
not
my
favorite
liefmans
goudenband
like
the
other
beers
in
their
portfolio
is
every
bit
as
fetching
as
its
packaging
and
no
less
distinctive
few
offerings
provide
such
an
authentic
taste
of
belgian
craftsmanship
and
tradition
want
to
buy
a
ticket
to
heaven
pair
this
considerably
musty
acidic
offering
with
strong
cheeses
and
dried
fruits
and
find
yourself
there
light
to
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
has
a
tart
apple
and
cherry
aftertaste
definitely
a
beer
i
want
to
have
again
o
very
interesting
brew
floral
and
fruity
in
general
crisp
and
refreshing
exceptionally
so
tart
and
sour
here
and
there
but
nothing
super
overpowering
nicely
varied
really
overall
this
isnt
something
i
would
choose
to
drink
everyday
but
it
is
obvious
from
from
everything
about
this
beer
that
there
is
quality
everyone
and
that
this
is
a
beer
to
be
savored
and
enjoyed
slowly
in
all
a
very
difficult
beer
for
me
to
try
to
convey
as
its
one
of
the
first
ive
had
in
the
style
and
the
flavor
and
aroma
profiles
are
vastly
different
than
what
i
am
accustomed
to
still
highly
recommended
for
anyone
looking
to
try
something
new
and
with
an
appreciation
for
craftsmanship
overall
really
well
balanced
and
complex
the
flavours
all
work
really
well
together
and
nothing
really
dominates
one
of
the
better
beers
within
the
style
that
i
have
ever
had
strong
at
8
but
wears
its
alcohol
well
tart
but
not
too
sour
to
drink
very
nicely
balanced
in
fact
i
dont
know
if
ill
always
be
reaching
it
for
it
but
its
a
legitimate
classic
beer
certainly
worth
a
go
by
anybody
overall
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
this
brew
is
a
copulation
of
fruit
salad
raisin
and
citrus
the
sourness
carries
though
the
finish
but
that
light
puckering
sensation
ends
rapidly
its
smooth
sour
finish
is
quite
unique
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
overall
coming
into
this
brew
i
was
pretty
excited
about
trying
this
brew
my
hopes
were
granted
the
beginning
of
this
adventure
i
was
quite
surprised
alcohol
is
virtually
nonexistent
and
had
a
perfect
carbonation
i
was
surprised
and
satisfied
at
the
same
time
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweet
and
sour
they
were
going
for
i
would
try
this
again
and
would
totally
recommend
to
a
friend
and
make
sure
they
enjoy
it
slowly
as
i
had
to
really
open
up
this

bodytrue
flavors

a

with
a

offwhite
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
nose
was
not
as
pronounced
as
expected
but
consisted
primarily
of
vinegar
and
sour
cherries
the
flavor
was
very
similar
to
the
nosenot
as
sour
as
i
expected
but
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
not
too
watery
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
would
love
to
drink
it
again
in
the
future
im
a
huge
fan
of
belgians
and
didnt
know
what
ton
expect
here
didnt
really
even
know
the
style
before
drinking
but
turned
out
to
be
a
flanders
old
brown
this
is
different
than
those
english
and
american
brown
ale
after
checking
out
the
beer
description
on
ba
of
the
style
fermentation
actually
produces
a
bi
product
called
diacetyl
which
produces
a
sour
flavor
definitely
a
characteristic
of
the
beer
also
gives
the
beer
some
buttery
notes
which
reading
up
on
diacetyl
is
used
to
artificially
flavor

but
excellent
nonetheless
some
sours
are
puckering
and
over
the
top
sour
some
like
the
duchesse
strike
a
balance
this
is
more
sweet
regardless
its
quite
tasty
alcohol
covered
up
very
well
goes
down
dangerously
smooth
overall
i
enjoyed
this
i
had
this
for
thanksgiving
dessert
with
i
can
finally
say
with
one
of
the
best
cherry
pies
ive
had
in
years
and
that
experience
i
would
give
a
five
to
but
anywhoo
i
did
not
enjoy
the
apple
cider
part
of
it
as
too
many
sugars
and
acidity
came
into
play
but
cooler
temps
proved
to
be
a
pretty
darn
tasty
sour
i
can
usually
put
this
down
myself
but
this
one
is
a
bottle
share
a
great
dessert
table
sour
and
the
price
point
cannot
be
beat
m
i
wished
the
beer
to
have
a
bit
more
of
body
however
thats
my
taste
in
the
end
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
can
have
another
one
for
sure
i
also
think
this
goes
well
with
a
tartpie
dessert
one
of
the
all
time
great
examples
of
a
flemish
brown
goudenband
is
not
always
easy
to
find
but
well
worth
the
effort
o
my
personal
preference
dictates
id
like
a
little
more
sourness
and
a
little
less
sweetness
and
a
lot
less
aspartame
thats
exactly
whats
keeping
this
very
good
offering
from
being
an
excellent
one
put
it
like
this
due
to
the
cloying
nature
im
questioning
whether
or
not
i
should
pawn
the
rest
of
the
750
off
to
someone
else
keep
in
mind
i
could
drink
a
couple
750s
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
and
still
wish
for
more
the
nose
is
somewhat
fruity
and
very
sweet
figs
golden
raisins
dark
cherries
and
a
giant
mound
of
brown
sugar
the
taste
is
much
more
tart
but
equally
simple
yet
complex
and
full
sour
cherries

grape
juice
plum
molasses
and
some
green
apples

brown
with
a
two
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
subsided
to
half

quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
fruit
cherry
sugar
tart
earth
and
wood
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wood
fruit
sour
tart
earth
raspberry
and
sugar
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
there
was
a
nice
sweetness
going
on
in
this
one
for
the
style
that
really
helped
to
balance
out
some
of
the
earthiness
that
one
usually
expects
with
the
style
there
wasnt
a
big
vinegar
aspect
that
really
made
it
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
the
raspberry
really
made
this
one
stand
out
and
really
refreshing
definitely
a
well
done
brew
but
what
does
one
really
expect
from
liefsman
at
this
point
interesting
beer
loved
the
nose
on
this
but
i
think
the
taste
is
a
big
let
down
too
much
tannins
really
detract
from
the

best
ive
had
it

the

is
really
nice
a
little
tart
not
quite
sour
with
some
fruity
notes
and
a
lot
of
hefty
caramel

sweetness
i
pick
up
some
fresh
figs
on
the
taste
as
well
as
dried
oranges
and
golden
raisins
it
is
a
complex
malt
base
here
the
top
notes
are
acidic
and
alcoholic
with
the
fruity
bits
taking
a
back
seat
to
yeasty
funk
and
tannic
dryness
all
of
it
getting
more
intense
as
it
warms
up
big
body
is
made
lighter
by
the
acid
and
by
lively
carbonation
i
could
se
myself
drinking
this
regularly
if
it
were
available
its
a
classy
beer
a
glistening
example
of
the
oud
bruit
style
and
a
beer
i
really
recommend
especially
at
the
9
bucks
a
bottle
steal
we
copped
this
for

d
throughout
this
review
vinegar
never
once
popped
into

although
other
strange
things
had
oxalis
wtf
setting
this
one
apart
from
other
beers
that
ive
tried
in
the
same
style
definitely
gonna
cellar
a
couple
bottles
the
bottle
might
not
say
much
but
the
wrapper
pajamas
say
a
lot
so
the
wrapper
says
liefmans

is
one
of
the
worlds
most
complex
beers
an
aged
belgian
brown
ale
it
is
brewerycellered
for
many
months
until
it
matures
only
then
is
it
blended

wonderful
and
a
beer
thats
rumored
to
have
gone
through
numerous
changes
the
past
decade
maybe
this
was
once
a
classic
grapes
this
beer
would
be
great
with
some
cherry
cheesecake
of
maybe
some
fruitcake
for
those
of
you
who
are
into
fruitcake
i
certainly
am
who
doesnt
love
the
paperwrapped
bottle
i
have
to
go
up
a
half
point
on
appearance
just
for
that
its
a
murky
reddish
brown
very
cloudy
with
no
real
head
the
smell
is
sour
cherries
with
a
sharp
acidic
note
to
it
there
is
a
malt
in
there
as
well
as
the
aroma
of
fresh
grape
juice
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
cherries
and
pipe
smoke
yes
pipe
smoke
i
have
no
idea
what
that
is
im
trying
to
describe
but
thats
as
close
as
i
come
it
finishes
dry
though
which
is
a
muchneeded
and
delightful
balance
nice
nice
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
almost
too
much
so
but
again
the
finish
saves
the
day
light
carbonation
provides
balance
and
saves
the
beer
from
veering
into
cough
syrup
territory
it
is
lightly
but
nicely
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
good
with
the
balances
making
the
experience
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
with
many
sides
to
its
personality
definitely
worth
a
trot
around
the
track
or
two
im
almost
sure
i
remember
buying
this
at
the
lcbo
if
so
i
hope
it
comes
back
in
the
fall
again
would
be
great
to
get
a
lot
more
an
outstanding
oud
bruin
it
is
a
shame
that
we
cant
get
more
down
here
in
tx
kind
of
strange
overall
im
afraid
that
age
may
have
taken
its
toll
on
this
beer
although
other
reviews
have
reported
bestby
dates
of
10
years
later
my
bottle
had
no
bestby
date
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
though
im
just
afraid
it
may
have
lost
some
complexities
anyway
id
still
certainly
recommend
it
and
maybe
a
more
experienced
palate
would
appreciate
it
more
i
dont
know
what
this
is
like
fresh
but
this
combination
of
flavors
has
melded
in
an
awesome
fashion
after
1
5
years
i
think
it
can
go
a
lot
longer
and
the
2015

agrees
with
me

with
the

amount
of
refreshing
sourness
that
you
never
tire
of
eminently
drinkable
very

not
too
anything
just
a
great

and
easy

brew
a

never

have
tried
this
if
not
for
this

and
its
eye

nice
mmmmsilky
smooth
mouthfeel
that
glides
across

imparting

flavors
that
are
coupled
with
loads
of
sour
cherry
a
sublime
drinking
experience
in
what
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
style
of
beer
all
the
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
and
even
the
high
abv
is
hidden
away
i
could
drink
this
every
day
and
not

pick
up
a
slight
presence
of
candysweet
caramel
in
the
back
definitely
caramelly
in
the
taste
which
couples
with
a
tart
apple
puckeriness
to
instantly
get
me
thinking
about
halloween
during
my
childhood
some
funky
wild
microbes
are
also
present
to
lend
a
nearly
lambic
edge
a
bit
of
montmorency
or
some
other
sort
of
sour
cherry
flavor
emerges
as
the
beer
warms
lightish
on
the
palate
but
the
complexity
of
the
soursweet
flavor
profile
lends
a
certain
heft
to
the
mouthfeel
lightly
carbonated
with
an
offdry
finish
a
masterful
creation
no
doubt
8
alcohol
by
volume
is
largely
imperceptible
if
not
for
its
strength
this
would
make
an
amazing
session
beer
highly
recommended
lovely
the
restrained
but
noticible
sourness
makes
this
quite
a
refreshing
drink
despite
the
strength
with
interesting
and
complex
flavors
drinkability
this
is
good
ale
but
not
great
this
would
be
better
enjoyed
just
before
or
after
a
meal
if
not
with
one
and
not
at
all
in
a
session
also
the
high
abv
holds
down
sessionability
pours
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
with
very
little
head
what
head
there
is
kicks
up
midway
through
the
pour
and
then
fades
in
a
flash
to
virtually
nothing
complex
nose
with
hints
of
oak
but
not
american
oak
just
a
more
subdued
woodiness
must
sour
cherries
and
funk
really
interesting
on
the
palate
tingly
acidity
and
smooth
malts
pop
up
first
with
some
funk
from
the
wood
aging
easily
distinguishable
especially
at
lower
temperatures
for
fruit
theres
cherries
the
sweeter
side
holds
chocolate
creme
and
there
are
some
nice
earthy
herbal
notes
in
there
too
the
finish
is
a
tad
sweet
and
certainly
tangy
mouthfeel
is
silky
in
the
malt
component
but
theres
an
acidic
edge
that
evens
things
out
and
adds
complexity
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
everything
is
perfectly
balanced
the
flavors
are
nuanced
and
enjoyable
each
part
on
its
own
merits
and
as
a
whole
cheers
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sour
beers
that
ive
had
fantastic
flavors
incredibly
complex
and
far
beyond
what
i
have
the
ability
to
describe
delicious
all
around
and
one
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
the
time
if
it
were
a
bit
more
affordable
the
paper
wrapper
tells
me
that
michael
jackson
calls
this
surely
the
worlds
finest
brown
ale
hes
not
far
off
on
this
one
not
tart
and
not
sweet
either
well
balanced
and
complex
this
is
a
definite
winner
great
transitional
beer
for
those
just
getting
into
the
realm
of
sour
beers
highly
recommended
and
worth
seeking
out
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
murky
colorlike
a
muddy
reddish
brown
high
level
of
carbonation
lactic
fruity
and
spicy
aroma
but
on
a
small
scale
big
lactic
and
sweet
malty
flavor
has
a
fantastic
mild
sourness
nice
almost
cherry
flavor
to
it
mildy
woody
perfect
mouthfeelhas
a
crispness
to
it
fairly
effervescent
oetongue
an
incredible
beer
i
had
this
years
ago
when
i
was
just
getting
into
belgians
couldnt
appreciate
it
then
the
whole
thing
is
great
wish
i
had
a
case
on
hand
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
light
body
and
is
well
carbonated
the
beer
even
seems
to
have
a
slight
butteryness
to
the
beer
the
sweetness
and
the
sourness
is
well
balanced
this
is
a
definate
beer
treat
i
will
have
this
one
again
should
i
get
the
chance
drinkability
pretty
good
sweet
with
a
little
bit
of
sourness
taste
is
tart
up
front
as
well
also
very
ciderlike
but
with
lots
of
other
spice
fruit
and
wood
happening
an
interesting
mix
of
falvours
means
you
have
to
take
your
time
with
it
to
work
it
out
perhaps
a
little
too
tart
but
that
mellows
out
as
it
warms
up
sweet
and
sour
balance
perfectly
in
this
beer
and
it
has
exceptional
character
goudenband
tastes
like
a
wild
traditional
farmhouse
ale
without
the
excessive
barnyard
flavours
that
many
other
sour
beers
i
have
tried
have
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
a
little
too
complex
dry
to
session
on
but
certainally
good
for
2
would
never
guess
this
was
8
abv
ive
had
better
flemish
browns
but
this
is
pretty
good
represents
the
style
well
there
are
just
so
many
very
different
flavors
moving
around
all
the
while
complementing
each
other
theres
just
enough
sourness
that
its
fascinating
and
the
wood
mellows
the
sour
shock
at
the
end
while
the
fruity
sweetness
offers
a
pleasant
beginning
d
more
than
one
would
be
a
sin
session
forget
it
way
too
sweet
i
have
had
this
beer
cellared
for
two
years
it
is
fresh
lively
and
very
enjoyable
i
wanted
to
try
this
one
at
room
temperature
as
well
but
it
was
so
good
i
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
and
allow
it
to
rest
drinkabilityoverall
a
very
nice
dry
mild
oud
bruin
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
other
rendition
ive
encountered
new
glarus
sour
brown
and
as
a
result
is
quite
drinkable
this
style
is
not
nearly
as
scary
as
i
once
thought
drinkabilty
great
tart
fruity
exceptionally
pleasant
the
overall
impression
is
a
little
like
a
dry
pear
champagne
with
more
hard
cider
notes
understated
despite
a
nice
complex
flavor
this
has
definitely
sold
me
on
the
oud
bruins
my
current
favorite
beer
period
this
is
quite
nice
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
the
barest
hints
of
carbonation
feels
like
an
iced
tea
sweet
and
candylike
which
wears
out
its
welcome
near
the
end
interesting
but
not
enough
to
want
to
try
this
one
again

beautiful
dark
and

plus
lactic
oak
notes
in
the
nose
with
a
stinging

mirror
the
aroma
a
balanced
sweet
and
sour
apple
and
oak
tartness
with
a
medium
rounded
lactic
finish
headiness
and
alcohol
warming
overtakes
you
after
a
few
sips
medium
thick
body
with
a
nice
mix
of
creaminess
and
slow
carbonation
so
delicious
notes
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
it
comes
across
like
a
lambic
without
the
stong
fruit
profile
im
in
375
ml
bottle
corked
and
caged
the
bottle
is
wrapped
in
paper
according
to
the
cork
this
is
the
2003
version
this
beer
pours
out
a
dark
red
color
without
much
head
there
are
lots
of
big
chunks
at
the
bottom
the
aroma
is
sour
dark
cherries
along
with
something
like
chocolate
the
flavor
is
slightly
sour
and
slightly
sweet
sour
green
apple
skin
and
cherries
there
are
some
oak
flavors
too
the
finish
is
a
bit
bitter
which
doesnt
go
well
with
the
sour
flavors
carbonation
is
low
this
is
a
pretty
good
sour
beer
although
there
seems
to
be
variation
from
bottle
to
bottle
after
the
first
bottle
i
was
definitely
ready
for
another
i
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
just
one
ill
have
to
try
a
freasher
sample
to
compare
the
two
but
i
cant
imagine
it
being
better
than
this
one
for
anyone
cellering
any
2000s
id
say
theyre
ready
to
go
d
great
a
celebration
beer
i
wouldnt
have
this
as
my
regular
beer
but
would
save
it
for
special
occasions

vinegar

the
aroma

chinese

is

by
some
sweeter
fruit
notes
including
cherry
and
slghtly
caramel
accented
malts
leaves
a
tongue
tingling
sourness
in

an
excellent
beer

worth
a
try

i
have
half
a
dozen
bottles
left
and
an
expiry

of
april
2016
d
delicious
for
sure
and
probably
very
appealing
to
a
wine
crowd
i
dont
know
if
i
can
drink
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
and
i
certainly
couldnt
afford
to
be
buying
this
all
the
time
pours
a
dark

tartness

the
taste
is
absolutely
fantastic

not
quite
sour

almost
cherry
like
finish
and
with
only
the
most
subtle
woody
notes
a
somewhat
lively
mouthfeel
but
yet
this
beers
quickly
turns
with
an
ever
growing
creaminess
towards
the
finish
light
in
some
way
what
a
great
fresh
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
balanced
quite
nicely
and
has
a
nice
complexity
about
it
easily
a
beer
to
sit
down
and
slowly
enjoy

probably
the
better
of
the

i
have
tasted
the

it
is
more
drinkable
than
petrus

ive
been
drinking
recently

with

pretty

drinkable
i
like
this
stuff
id
bet
this
would
benefit
from
a
bit

age
in

i
have
no
recollection
that
this
tasted
like
this
the
mouthfeel
was
appropriately
astrigent
and
the
8
abv
is
not
existence
but
it
is
very
warming
so
you
know
it
it
there
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
this
rare
style
and
i
now
wish
i
had
more
then
two
bottles
despite
the
acid
i
could
never
grow
tired
of
drinking

i
dont
know
how
they
do

of
the

bit
woody
but
overall
very
enjoyable
recommended
i
paid
only
6

a
750ml
bottle
at
bevmo
and
this
is
better
than
some
other
belgians
that
cost
much
more

irony
in

kriekbier
but
with
a
more
dry

finish
as
opposed
to
the
sweet

fantastic
and
very
drinkable
beer
the
capped
and
corked
green
bottle
says
that
the
beer
is
best
consumed
before
2014

indicates
that
it
was
bottled
in
2004

tart
fruitiness
upfront
with
cherry
and
woody
tones

up
alongside

the
sweetness
comes
through
a
momentary
reprieve
from
the
intensely
sour
opening
before
the

comes
through
dry

mouthfeel
is
good
well
carbonated
and
sticky
at
the

though
maybe
a
little
thin
and
drinkability
is
quite
good
very
nice
quintessential
example
of
the
style
mdr
a
complex

mellow

in

drinkability
my
favorite
oud
bruin
out
the
the
few
ive
had
hands
down
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
last
year
but
never
got
to
drink
it
because
it
fell
out
of
my
dbf
onto
the
carpet
and
broke
if
i
ever
see
it
again
there
is
going
to
be
at
least
510
bottles
going
back
with
me
a
great
beer
with
very
interesting
complex
flavors
the
first
of
this
style
ive
tried
based
on
this
sample
id
try
it
again
almost
no
head
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
ruby
red
colour
with
amber
highlights
aromas
of
tobacco
sour
cherry
and
leather
complex
flavour
with
some
sourness
tobacco
cherry
fruit
and
earthy
woodiness
the
midway
point
becomes
somewhat
sweeter
and
it
finishes
with
considerable
malt
moderately
light
carbonation
quite
dry
and
lightly
puckering
medium
body
quite
a
distinctive
beer
with
a
fruity
and
sour
character
and
a
complex
finish
i
think
ill
have
to
have
this
one
again
wow
this
beer
is
really
really
good
poured
out
to
a
dark
red
brown
color
similar
to
a
blood
red
minor
notes
of
lace
aromas
of
fermenting
cherries
rotted
grapes
sweet
malts
and
a
tartness
that
reminded
me
of
childrens
candies
from
years
ago
taste
was
exceptional
flavors
of
cherries
grapes
sugarcane
malts
spices
and
herbs
blend
in
a
world
of
perfection
mouthfeel
is
heavenly
smooth
medium
bodied
yet
reserving
enough
to
fill
the
palate
and
keep
the
drinker
begging
for
more
execeptional
drinkability
i
would
drink
this
everyday
if
it
werent
so
expensive
the
only
drawback
is
that
when
poured
toward
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
got
clumps
literally
clumps
of
sediment
not
very
appealing
but
this
beer
is
so
good
i
totally
overlook
this
fact
world
class
beer
get
this
go
to
great
lengths
if
you
must
the
reward
is
worth
it
this
beer
is
a
master
at
hiding
its
abvno
sense
of
alcohol
at
all
refreshing
and
extremely
satisfying
this
brew
is
wondrously
rewarding
cork
is
printed
with
the
year
2003
opinion
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
this
one
is
superbly
balanced
between
the
tart
and
sweet
only
because
it
has
a
bit
of
an
acidic
note
do
i
score
it
a
bit
lower
on
the
drinkability
this
is
because
i
was
ready
for
a
glass
of
water
after
finishing
this
one
still
a
world
class
beer
and
one
not
to
miss
2003

the
head
is
an
aggregation
of
fine
light
tan
bubbles
about
12
deep
that
leave
a
few
thin
arcs
of
lace
as
they
die
beer
is
russett
in
color
with
garnet
highlights
although
too
murky
to
see
any
carbonation
aroma
begins
pleasantly
like
dried
black
cherries
but
eventually
becomes
a
cherry
antacid
humdrum
the
nosefeel
is
initally
vinous
and
only
somewhat
tart
progressively
developing
an
inorganic
nearmetallic
bitterness
that
fills
the
sinus
the
tastes
are
slightly
more
engaging
black
cherry
sweetness
and
dried
cranberry
sourness
play
off
of
each
other
like
preserves
spread
over
a
sodacrackerbicarbonate
base
fruit
pits
show
up
and
pull
the
tastebuds
toward
oaky
wood
and
a
dull
mineral
finish
mouthfeel
seems
washy
and
only
slightly
tart
and
too
neutral
to
really
interest
me
easy
drinkability
with
no
alcohol
noticeable
so
whats
with
all
these
people
talking
about
being
blown
away
by
sourness
and
oak
and
vinegar
i
think
i
was
expecting
something
really
extreme
because
while
this
was
good
it
was
far
more
tame
than
i
had
hoped
a
light
earthybriney
flavor
reminds
me
orval
except
with
more
body
and
sweetness
riding
on
the
side
saddle
with
french
ales
but
with
the
sour
attitue
of
the
senne
valley
the
beer
is
a
new
adventure
with
each
sip
masculine
and
refines
but
without
pretention
thanks
for
the
tasting
len
both
are
immensely
drinkable
and
palatably
interesting
in
their
own
rights
although
i
prefer
the
older
sample
for
its
mellower
flavors
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
changes
in
pleasantly
interesting
ways
over
time
the
mouth
is
good
for
the
style
i
like
how
the
sour
notes
come
in
towards
the
end
allowing
for
the
malt
profile
to
register
although
the
abv
is
well
hidden

can
creep
up
on
you
and
make
for
an
early
night
otherwise
this
would
be
quite
the
session
brew
muddy
brown
with
chunks
of
yeast
sediment
no
head
the
lactic
or
brett
over
powers
almost
everything
you
can
get
som
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
sweet
and
sour
like
one
of
those
charms
lollipops
but
heavier
on
the
sour
quite
full
bodied
but
the
sour
finishees
puckering
i
guess
thats
the
way
its
supposed
to
be
overall
my
first
oud
bruin
but
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
it
doesnt
pour
too
impressively
but
the
nice
wellrounded
fruity
tartness
of
the
flavor
and
the
light
dry
finish
won
me
over
dark
maroon
colored
body
head
is
tan
and
creamy
about

smell
has
a
brilliant
smell
to
it
very
sour
with
cherry
and
other
fruits
very
inviting
taste
is
sour
and
bold
but
has
an
extremely
smooth
drinkability
lots
of
different
flavors
in
the
mix
this
is
a
much
tamer
and
malty
example
than
the
other
oud
bruin
i
have
tried
new
glarus
sour
brown
definitely
worth
a
shot
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
adds
a
crisp
feeling
to
this
mouthfeel
is
still
decently
full
even
with
the
carbonation
levels
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
due
to
the
nice
sweet
and
sour
combo
without
being
overthetop
tart
bottle
my
first
flanders
oud
bruin
dark
amber
with
ruby
tints
and
a
bubbly
light
tan
head
which
left
good
lacing
sweet
malt
and
sour
aromas
with
a
little
ester
in
the
background
but
somewhat
muted
and
subtle
compared
to
say
a
belgian
dark
strong
taste
is
nicely
balanced
between
sweet
and
sour
with
almost
no
bitterness
and
dry
but
very
slight
metalic
finish
there
is
almost
no
hint
of
the
relatively
high
abv
and
it
gets
better
the
more
you
drink
palate
is
divine
fine
carbonation
results
a
light
touch
despite
a
medium
body
eminently
quaffable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
this
is
a
unique
and
tasty
brew
that
i
have
no
problem
consuming
i
very
much
enjoy
the
sweetsour
aspect
of
it
and
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
in
the
future
taste
of
cherry
and
oak
a
bit
maltish
corn
with
a
followed
alcohol
flavours
that
comes
trick
us
a
good
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
especially
during
dessert

without
any
particles
and
a
red
shine
in
it
nose
is
sweet
malty

hardly
any
sourness
to
be
noticed
clean
and
nothing
spontainous
in
it
taste
is
sweetsour
and
malty
ending
more
sour
and
only
giving
you
litle
bitterness
the
lack
of
taste
except
the
sweetsour
doesnt
make
it
really
enjoyable
but
drinkable
great
one
to
try
drinkability
and
overall
a
classic
that
actually
lives
up
to
its
hype
this
beer
ahcieves
the
most
perfect
balance
possible
and
the
result
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
a
masterpiece
of
flavors
achieved
by
water
treatment
multistrain
yeast
slow
maturation
4
12
months
reblending
with
younger
beer
and
bottle
aging
in
the
cellars
a
new
favorite
a
world
class
beer
had
this
ontap
at
the
cah
served
in
the
default
belgian
ale
glass
this
beer
looked
like
carbonated
dishwater
with
a
dirty
foam
top
murky
swirls
of
brown
and
red
and
then
clearer
spots
so
that
it
moved
between
opaqueness
and
transluscence
the
smell
was
fruity
and
malty
i
couldnt
place
the
odors
but
the
taste
was
sour
and
sweet
your
first
thought
is
that
the
beer
has
gone
bad
and
then
the
malts
take
over
after
the
first
shock
of
the
taste
your
brain
will
settle
down
and
let
the
sweet
and
sour
mix
with
each
additional
sip
the
carbonation
and
complexity
of
the
taste
gave
this
a
medium
mouthfeel
coating
all
oral
surfaces
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
their
own
the
sourness
gives
it
thirst
quenching
power
and
it
is
a
smooth
easy
drinker
i
will
seek
out
more
examples
of
flanders
reds
pretty
good
beer
though
the
yeast
flavor
came
across
a
little
dirty
as
a
drank
the
bottle
it
started
out
a
little
too
sweet
then
swung
to
the
other
extreme
by
becoming
strongly
sour
but
as
i
reached
the
bottom
of
my
glass
everything
balanced
out
nicely
and
it
seemed
to
gain
complexity
this
is
not
a
beer
to
drink
many
of
in
a
sitting
enjoy
it
with
some
sweet
cake
with
fresh
sweet
fruit
taste
is
also
that
fruity
sourness
sweet
spice
cinnamon
clove
and
sour
cherry
and
berry
acidic
and
underpinnings
of
vinegar
that
sounds
bad
but
somehow
it
works
some
funky
brett
as
t
warms
yeasty
mouth
is
thinner
than
you
would
expect
but
lots
of
flavor
a
nice
smooth
beer
and
one
of
my
favorites
a
bit
younger
than
i
like
this
beer
but
still
complex
and
tasty
be
warned
though
2002
and
presumably
later
bottlings
suck
a
beautiful
beer
truly
luckly
i
walked
home
with
a
bottle
of
this
thanks
to
a
holiday
ba
gathering
i
enjoyed
on
christmas
eve
decanted
a
nice
ruby
tinged
dark
brown
into
my
glass
with
a
tingling
white
foam
head
a
nice
earthy
complement
to
the
colors
of
christmas
aroma
is
of
subdued
tart
cherries
nuts
and
a
very
small
dose
of
funk
taste
is
very
well
balanced
hitting
notes
of
cherries
barnyard
earthy
flavors
and
nuts
all
wrapped
up
in
a
pleasant
slightly
acidic
package
excellent
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
sample
it

i
understand
he
that
this
is
not
what
alot
of
folks
are
looking
for
in
a
beer
quite
a
drinkable
beer
just
a
tiny
bit
cloying
but
no
too
much
to
make
it
unenjoyable
i
enjoyed
the
entire
glass
and
could
have
done
3
more
doubtless
hard
to
describe
only
in
a
good
way
this
is
close
to
beer
perfection
so
unique
and
incredibly
complex
it
will
pair
with
many
foods
damn
refreshing
i
must
say
that
i
was
extremely
excited
to
taste
this
beer
after
spotting
it
at
my
local
mecca
the
appearance
is
brown
with
a
touch
of
red
glow
to
back
it
there
was
a
very
heavy
yeast
presence
that
i
managed
to
keep
in
the
bottle
no
head
whatsoever
but
i
didnt
expect
one
from
this
the
aroma
is
very
present
with
chocolate
and
rotting
cherries
coming
to
mind
the
initial
taste
is
sour
and
i
love
it
the
tartness
is
extremely
present
but
it
doesnt
hang
irritate
the
mouth
there
is
a
dry
finish
to
it
and
the
sour
fruit
taste
makes
its
final
statement
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
should
be
enjoyed
at
a
slow
pace
i
drank
it
out
of
a
snifter
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
good
choice
it
really
held
the
aroma
well
go
and
try
this
but
be
prepared
for
sourness
a
dark
cloudy
heavily
sedimented
mahogony
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
sour
cherries
and
malt
wonderfully
sour
and
smooth
the
tartness
is
so
intense
it
actually
causes
my
eyes
to
water
this
is
a
most
unusual
taste
and
is
really
hard
to
categorize
each
mouthful
provides
different
tastes
and
sensations
again
the
feel
is
a
tough
call
as
the
lack
of
carbonation
leaves
it
milky
you
can
tell
there
is
body
there
it
just
doesnt
hit
you
like
most
beers
the
flavors
play
across
your
tounge
and
disappear
in
a
blaze
of
tartness
leaving
a
dry
palate
this
is
a
special
beer
and
should
only
be
drunk
when
you
have
the
time
to
truly
enjoy
it
i
am
now
resolving
to
find
more
of
those
occaisions
had
on
tap
at
anam
cara
and
enjoyed
this
fine
beer
very
much
pour
whens
erved
was
deep
chestnut
brown
it
came
topped
with
a
14
of
creamy
white
foam
i
thought
the
aroma
was
rich
malt
meet
your
new
friend
candi
sugar
very
very
tasty
this
beer
for
me
was
all
about
smooth
malt
i
didnt
detect
any
overt
sweetness
in
the
taste
but
really
enjoyed
the
maltiness
dark
slightly
cloudy
purplish
brown
and
completely
flat
looks
almost
like
wine
with
black
yeast
flakes
that
settle
to
the
bottom
smells
like
sour
cherries
and
malt
alcohol
with
a
mellowed
sour
cherry
caramel
brown
sugar
flavor
very
well
balanced
im
not
normally
a
sour
guy
but
this
beers
amazing
smoothness
hits
you
sour
up
front
but
finishes
mellow
suprisingly
refreshing
not
the
style
i
would
normally
pick
but
good
good
stuff
inch
head
of
light
widely
separated
froth
that
sticks
and
chantillylaces
all
the
way
through
the
pour
this
subsided
to
a
hot
chocolatelike
covering
of
full
but
small
layering
pungent
chewy
malt
that
verges
on
an
acidic
cherry
on
the
nose
to
taste
a
core
of
fruit
punches
right
through
the
back
of
the
mouth
among
other
things
plums
raisins
peaches
and
macoun
apples
created
a
base
upon
which
a
settling
sweetness
piled
on
top
this
was
possibly
one
of
the
better
offerings
i
have
ever
quaffed
from
the
other
side
of
the
pond
flanders
red
ales
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
a
more
recent
vintage
of
this
one
very
complex
and
tasty
even
at
this
stage
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
this
its
awesome
to
find
such
rarities
on
tap
and
this
one
really
takes
the
cake
for
complexity
expensive
yes
worth
it
yes
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
but
i
might
abstain
as
this
is
a
treat
not
to
be
taken
and
tampered
with
by
sessioning
it
a
very
complex
brew
i
will
try
it
again
pours
with
a
fizzy
brief
deep
cream
colored
head
settling
over
dark
garnetbrownish
liquid
tart
sour
nose
with
a
whiff
of
brett
funkiness
a
hint
of
cherry
wine
sourness
carries
thru
in
the
taste
along
with
light
metallic
notes
some
astringent
dryness
followed
by
a
brief
malt
sweetness
and
some
hoppiness
and
a
warming
alcoholic
finish
ends
up
drysour
then
underlying
malt
sweetness
comes
in
very
refreshing
due
to
the
acidity
and
somewhat
light
body
the
cork
on
this
one
says
1999
so
it
was
kindly
aged
on
the
shelves
for
me
for
about
6
years
since
i
just
picked
it
up
2
days
ago
the
beer
is
a
nice
deep
red
color
almost
brown
untill
you
hold
it
to
the
light
and
i
can
see
it
is
just
deep
deep
red
there
are
tons
of
floaties
and
a
lack
of
carbontion
and
no
head
the
nose
is
rather
malty
with
sweet
caramel
and
sour
cherries
it
is
very
inviting
the
taste
is
mindblowing
the
sweet
and
sour
and
tart
balance
in
this
wonderful
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
sour
cherries
that
were
aged
in
a
used
whisky
barrel
just
a
wonderful
transition
between
all
the
contrasting
flavors
i
have
not
had
a
beer
like
this
before
and
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
in
the
style
the
beer
is
thin
to
moderate
in
mouthfeel
i
only
wish
this
were
a
500
ml
bottle
not
sure
they
even
have
those
for
this
beer
because
i
am
sad
that
im
almost
done
drinking
this
one
a
very
small
almost
white
head
sits
on
a
cloudy
dark
redbrown
beer
full
of
big
pale
chunks
of
float
the
nose
is
fruity
sweet
with
a
hint
of
tartness
some
woodiness
starts
sweet
almost
grapey
with
considerable
woody
notes
a
full
malty
middle
and
a
dryish
but
still
fruity
finish
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
tartness
and
oomph
a
little
less
sweetness
but
its
an
excellent
beer
i
truly
am
blown
away
i
cant
believe
a
beer
taste
like
this
after
six
years
in
the
bottle
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
some
light
ruby
hues
and
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
yeast
chunks
are
all
over
the
place
in
this
beer
finally
settling
down
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
aromas
are
malty
and
sugary
with
some
molasses
aromas
sneaking
their
way
into
the
picture
there
is
also
some
tartness
noticeable
and
almost
a
wine
like
aroma
for
flavor
this
beer
starts
off
initially
quite
sweet
with
brown
sugar
and
molasses
being
the
most
dominant
flavors
along
with
some
nice
malts
following
a
slight
tartness
hits
with
some
dark
fruits
maybe
figs
or
grapes
which
add
a
nice
flavor
to
the
beer
this
beer
finishes
tart
and
refreshing
with
a
slight
sourness
also
and
a
warm
alcohol
note
overall
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
refreshing
to
the
beer
i
personally
would
have
liked
a
little
more
tartness
and
sourness
from
the
beer
and
a
little
less
sweetness
but
overall
a
tasty
brew
dark
brown
appearance
minimal
head
smells
like
red
wine
or
maybe
sherry
taste
is
like
a
brilliant
sweet
red
wine
with
cherry
tones
pleasant
on
the
tongue
this
was
a
perfect
after
dinner
drink
went
out
and
bought
a
bottle
after
having
this
on
tap
for
the
first
time
i
hope
the
bottle
version
can
come
close
to
the
tap
version
comments

this
is
a
2001
so
has
been
sitting
for
three
years
and
is
no
worse
the
wear
there
should
be
a
tree
on
the
label
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
on
the
start
and
finish
the
sour
cherries
last
long
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
this
is
a
slow
sippin
brew
to
enjoy
after
dinner
but
one
is
all
you
need
flavor
is
at
first
prickly
with
the
sourness
but
a
rising
brown
sugary
sweetness
holds
it
at
bay
as
those
dark
pudding
fruits
return
for
a
dance
on
the
palate
before
a
long
lasting
sourness
busts
through
to
sweep
it
all
aside
had
a
fresh
one
about
two
years
later
and
moderate
tartness
with
winelike
taste
and
sight
an
unusual
beer
worth
trying
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
i
cant
get
enough
of
the
sweet
n
tart
flavor
characteristic
of
flanders
reds
of
which
this
is
my
favorite
example
when
i
want
something
dark
and
belgian
i
may
very
well
head
this
directionthough
why
id
limit
myself
to
one
such
brew
i
have
no
idea
very
good
original
review
312004
i
have
had
this
amazing
beer
several
times
before
i
decided
to
review
it
this
is
one
of
my
wow
beers
funny
though
that
i
opened
this
bottle
specifically
to
rate
it
and
it
is
different
than
the
5
or
6
of
these
ive
had
before
including
once
on
tap
at
lucky
baldwins
what
i
remember
from
the
others
is
an
amazing
balance
of
fruit
slight
sweetness
oak
aged
feel
like
a
complex
wine
balanced
by
a
marvelous
tartsourness
this
bottle
had
all
the
things
i
describe
in
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
dominated
by
tartsourbitter
much
more
so
than
in
previous
bottles
i
dont
know
if
this
is
because
its
a
different
vintageage
if
it
has
turned
a
bit
or
if
it
was
my
palate
but
this
one
seems
to
have
some
variability
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
brown
that
hides
ruby
port
and
goldenreds
in
its
complexity
much
like
the
slight
sweet
fruity
aroma
hides
plums
sour
grapes
apples
and
who
knows
what
else
there
is
no
head
on
this
beer
the
flavor
is
sour
like
a
geuezelambic
with
lots
of
other
things
going
on
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
alcohol
is
no
where
to
be
seen
except
as
a
warming
sensation
im
not
sure
if
this
particular
bottle
was
off
or
not
my
scores
are
based
on
several
tries
maybe
ill
have
to
try
it
a
few
dozen
times
more
to
see
what
it
is
really
like
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
bubbly
head
the
nose
is
a
flowery
barnyard
caramel
with
a
little
cherry
flavor
is
very
pleasant
a
little
spice
some
woodiness
smooth
but
somewhat
thin
bodied
lots
of
sour
cherry
grapes
and
high
acidity
finish
is
bitter
peppery
and
dry
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
easydrinking
treat
compared
to
the
fresh
draught
version
i
quaffed
at
monks
this
beer
is
not
as
bright
much
more
complex
and
subtly
so
the
smooth
moderate
mouthfeel
is
also
similar
but
lacks
most
of
the
nice
carbonation
i
found
from
a
keg
regardless
a
refined
and
true
classic
in
the
world
of
beer
always
a
good
750
ml
choice
for
the
cellar
this
beer
was
the
highlight
of
my
adventure
to
louisville
in
april
it
is
best
saved
for
a
special
occasion
drinkability
i
will
try
others
of
this
style
in
the
future
but
for
now
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
my
repeat
list
murky
looking
deep
auburn
appearance
virtually
no
head
very
nice
aroma
hot
spiced
apple
cider
brown
sugar
candied
raspberries
mouthfeel
is
light
and
on
the
low
side
of
the
spectrum
for
carbonation
the
flavor
has
a
little
sweet
and
sour
thing
going
on
just
a
little
bit
of
a
stinging
acetic
acid
presence
but
also
some
sugar
coated
raspberries
other
fruit
sensations
surface
as
well
such
as
green
apple
pear
and
blackberry
this
one
has
a
nice
mellowness
to
it
could
be
from
the
aging
pretty
good
stuff
overall
impression
finally
tried
this
old
classic
definitely
a
fan
of
their
kriekenbier
both
the
sweetened
and
the
natural
one
so
it
was
nice
to
taste
the
base
beer
swirling
up
and
adding
the
bottlesediment
really
kicks
up
the
complexity

this
used
to
be
a
favourite
overall
really
its
very
good
indeed
theres
so
much
complexity
especially
on
the
nose
and
on
the
front
of
the
palate
and
the
lightness
on
the
back
really
aids
the
drinkability
for
a
5
beer
its
impressive
the
amount
of
flavour
thats
packed
in
its
a
lesson
to
anyone
who
thinks
that
only
is
bigger
better
i
liked
it
a
lot
overall
impression
a
darker
and
more
malt
driven
brother
of
the
flanders
red
skirts
line
between
wine
and
beer
with
obvious
dark
fruit
character
but
adds
toffee
and
malt
sweetness
o
a
classic
example
of
the
style
not
very
complex
but
clean
and
pure
body
is
medium
to
mediumlight
with
carbonation
levels
of
fairly
low
intensity
resulting
in
a
beer
that
is
very
smooth
across
the
palate
allowing
for
the
mild
acidity
to
move
this
across
the
palate
closes
fairly
dry
with
little
to
no
residual
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
pours
a
murky
brown
with
very
little
head
scant
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
biscuit
with
some
vegetal
notes
the
taste
is
very
nice
clean
minerals
an
earthy
tang
and
some
robust
sweet
malt
its
a
little
undercarbonated
but
very
smooth
all
in
all
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
too
bad
its
so
hard
to
find
the
goudenband
is
a
more
sophisticated
complex
expression
but
this
is
a
satisfactory
less
expensive
version
d
this
beer
finds
the
sweet
spot
between
the
overly
sweet
belgian
offerings
read
lindemans
that
many
are
familiar
with
and
the
more
traditional
sour
flanders
reds
not
the
most
complex
flanders
but
a
very
approachable
one
that
could
appeal
to
the
masses
a
very
nice
beer
all
around
that
i
would
gladly
drink
again
fyi
my
wife
was
a
huge
fan
as
well
i
dont
really
see
a
head
at
all
its
got
a
body
reminiscent
of
cherry
juice
and
an
aroma
to
boot
the
smell
is
loaded
with
cherries
sweetened
sour
cherries
all
the
way
the
taste
follows
suit
sour
cherries
with
a
good
bit
of
funk
to
come
in
late
this
beer
wants
to
beer
sour
yet
still
wants
to
be
a
super
sweet
kriek
o
looking
for
more
distinct
flavors
but
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
o
this
beer
is
not
good
but
is
also
not
entirely
wretched
it
lacks
depth
and
substance
and
is
obviously
not
brewed
with
the
fan
of
traditional
flemish
oud
bruins
in
mind
most
oud
bruins
are
lactic
and
sour
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
this
beer
is
sweet
and
oddly
toasty
with
a
subtle
hint
of
vinegar
sourness
i
imagine
mixing
a
bottle
of
newcastle
brown
ale
with
a
traditional
flemish
oud
bruin
would
produce
a
very
similar
effect
if
you
have
to
try
this
beer
use
it
as
an
accompaniment
to
food
otherwise
stick
with
liefmans
goudenband
and
the
sour
brown
ales
brewed
by
verhaege
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
because
its
not
overly
tart
or
sour
the
quintessential
oud
bruin
fruity
tart
flavor
upfront
a
caramel
middle
then
a
dry
finish
light
bodied
creamy
and
mildly
tart
feels
a
little
dead
like
flat
soda
in
the
finish
tangy
not
overly
sweetened
thankfully
decent
not
great
more
of
a
training
wheels
oud
bruin
not
a
lot
of
depth
here
and
pretty
restrained
sourness
it
does
attempt
to
be
somewhat
traditional
but
still
feels
a
bit
over
processed
and
watered
down
for
the
masses
overall
rather
sweet
when
compared
to
other
oud
bruins
i
have
tasted
not
sure
i
would
seek
out
again
medium
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
d
ive
yet
to
find
a
sour
beer
that
was
sessionable
but
this
is
fairly
close
given
that
i
would
probably
drink
this
sparingly
in
order
to
better
appreciate
it
the
beer
gives
me
the
impression
of
sour
patch
kids
candies
where
theres
really
two
different
sets
of
characteristics
in
the
glass
theres
a
solid
sour
ale
and
then
theres
a
malty
sweet
ale
that
seems
a
bit
like
rochefort
10
but
with
only
moderate
intensity
neither
are
able
to
command
the
beer
o
i
was
really
in
the
mood
for
something
sour
but
this
didnt
quite
cut
it
nicely
balanced
however
just
nothing
spectacular
it
would
probably
make
a
nice
gateway
beer
for
getting
into
the
sour
realm
overall
smooth
with
a
good
amount
of
sourness
i
enjoyed
the
fruit
notes
reminded
me
of
raspberries
a
little
bit
really
drinkable
especially
at
5
balanced
between
the
sweet
and
sour
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
vibrant
red
brown
with
a
two
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
cherry
wood
sour
tart
and
very
slight
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
tart
cherry
wood
raspberries
and
subtle
funk
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
definitely
not
my
favorite
from
the
style
but
still
pretty
good
i
like
how
this
brew
incorporated
tart
cherry
and
raspberry
into
the
flavor
as
this
made
it
much
more
palatable
than
some
harsher
oud
bruins
i
have
had
in
the
past
a
definitely
well
done
brew
that
i
would
definitely
drink
again
given
the
opportunity
overall
never
had
this
style
before
very
nice
and
refreshing
beverage
beer
is
really
thin
and
kind
of
flavorless
it
is
mildly
acetic
and
has
his
sweetness
to
it
a
little
oaky
but
overall
really
boring
i
wont
have
it
again
surprisingly
sour
and
not
very
sweet
nothing
like
the
nose
the
finish
has
some
sugar
showing
up
and
the
sourness
becomes
more
muted
the
aftertaste
is
shortlived
the
body
is
typical
the
carbonation
is
on
the
lighter
side
i
thought
it
on
the
fizzy
side
which
i
believe
is
not
normal
in
this
style
but
it
added
a
new
dimension
to
the
tasting
which
i
enjoyed

i

quite
good
and
wish

had

would
drink

worth
trying

id
drink
a

more

that
i
wish
was
more
readily
available

the
best

ive
ever

still
not
my
favorite

theres
no

this

is
impressive

overall
this

slight

a

balanced
the

is
quiet

taste
is
very

with
a
well

sourness
covered
by
some
sugar
and
some
oak
definitely
not
as
great
as
rodenbach
grand

but
very
interesting
nonetheless
and
i
would
love
to
have
access
to
this
as
a
session
ale
for
those
hot
summer
days
thick
mattress
of
foam
lasting
on
a
dark
brown
color
body
the
smell
is
lightly
tart
for
a
oud
bruin
showing
more
round
malty
notes
and
fruity
notes
red
fruits
on
one
side
and
citrus
in
the
carbonation
in
the
other
in
the
taste
too
the
tart
aspect
isnt
overwhelming
the
maltiness
is
made
more
round
by
the
fruity
tart
notes
that
appear
after
a
second
with
light
wooden
notes
mouthfeel
isnt
unpleasing
but
a
bit
watery
for
the
style
a
oud
bruin
that
seems
to
try
to
attract
to
the
masses
and
that
succeeds
exceptional
drinkability
i
wish
i
had
a
keg
of
this
one
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
and
quite
similar
to
its
kindred
flanders
red
ales
but
a
bit
more
complex
with
a
noticeable
malt
underbelly
the
aroma
was
promising
sour
cherry
dusty
and
old
however
there
was
an
unexpected
amount
of
sweetness
in
the
aroma
sweet
chocolate
dark
fruit
to
start
with
only
a
hint
of
sour
cherries
or
vinous
characters
not
what
id
hoped
for
but
still
tasty
anyway
good
and
drinkable
but
weak
wheres
my
rodenbach
25
cl
bottle
not
great
compared
to
others
of
its
kindred
but
in
a
bar
i
would
get
a
second
round
of
this
very
soupy
thin
but
drinkable
because
of
it
this
is
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
pours
with
an
average
sized
light
brown
head
that
reduces
to
a
rather
nice
lace
the
color
is
very
brown
with
a
few
reddish
highlights
theres
a
very
slight
hazy
there
is
a
slight
malt
aroma
with
no
real
hops
noticeable
aromas
of
cherry
wine
and
oak
are
also
present
ive
read
someplace
that
this
is
used
as
a
base
for
liefmans
kriekbier
and
if
this
is
true
it
definitely
seems
like
it
would
lend
itself
to
this
task
the
start
is
light
and
sweet
with
cherry
notes
oaky
wine
notes
pick
up
a
bit
and
finishes
tart
and
dry
the
tartness
of
the
finish
lasts
for
quit
a
while
the
carbonation
is
rather
soft
and
the
body
is
somewhat
watery
at
times
no
alcohol
is
noticeable
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
but
not
one
that
i
would
prefer
to
drink
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
i
got
this
as
an
intro
to
the
style
id
say
it
did
its
job
well
in
that
regards
but
ill
think
ill
move
on
to
bigger
and
better
i
didnt
get
tired
of
it
and
could
have
stood
to
have
had
another
had
i
purchased
one
brilliantly
clear
garnet
hue
topped
by
a
meager
spotty
soapy
head
laceless
sugary
caramel
and
ripe
pruneish
esters
dominate
the
aroma
with
cidery
tartness
and
hints
of
sour
damp
oak
adding
a
secondary
contrast
akin
to
a
sour
esb
in
aroma
very
odd
mellow
lactic
tartness
incipient
in
flavor
is
promptly
superceded
by
obtrusive
dark
candi
sugar
sweetness
which
overrides
the
understated
tart
woody
undertone
lanky
malt
backbone
manages
a
vapid
bread
like
note
horsey
enteric
notes
do
manage
to
poke
through
the
dominant
sugar
presence
lending
a
sweetened
soured
old
ale
impression
thin
in
body
yet
with
a
sticky
sucrose
rich
mouthfeel
that
weighs
on
the
palate
finishes
with
a
slight
augmentation
of
lactic
tartness
thats
too
little
too
late
an
odd
unbalanced
brew
in
which
the
addition
of
sugar
masked
most
microflora
derived
complexity
as
the
palate
adjusts
oud
bruin
falls
short
in
delivery
overall
but
isnt
wretched
my
initial
impression
was
that
it
was
stick
with
liefmans
goudenband
and
their
lambics
the
colour
of
this
beer
is
a
dark
brownred
with
mahogany
reflexes
a
beautiful
head
soft
and
compact
but
not
persistent
smell
of
fresh
must
grapes
and
even
sour
black
cherry
these
is
a
probable
addition
of
sugar
and
this
spoils
the
complexity
of
the
beer
even
at
the
taste
the
sweet
is
too
high
the
taste
is
less
strong
the
the
flavour
maybe
the
sugar
it
results
not
well
balanced
maybe
you
can
fell
a
very
little
note
of
tartness
but
very
very
light
overall
probably
the
first
tired
hands
beer
i
have
been
disappointed
by
there
are
a
lot
of
good
flavors
but
it
is
lacking
the
carbonation
is
low
and
this
could
but
a
bad
effect
on
the
taste
overall
really
good
and
really
interesting
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
mushrooms
and
i
still
liked
it
quite
a
bit
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
either
mushrooms
or
sour
brown
ales
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
from
this
im
not
a
fan
of
mushrooms
but
tried
it
anyways
wow
this
thing
is
spot
on
smells
like
woods
and
slight
amount
of
acidity
you
get
a
lot
of
earth
and
dirt
coming
through
probably
from
the
mushrooms
its
really
well
rounded
and
has
great
mouthfeel
pretty
high
carbed
no
acetobactor
coming
through
and
no
harshness
at
all
just
a
straight
tart
pleasant
sourness
tired
hands
nails
it
again
with
this
one
this
was
just
a
strange
beer
it
was
only
slightly
sour
and
then
it
had
an
earthy
finish
it
was
a
strange
combination
and
as
i
got
further
down
the
glass
it
got
worse
it
was
somewhat
of
a
struggle
to
finish
this
off
i
didnt
really
taste
any
shitake
in
this
beer
at
all
either
great
sour
the
sour
level
is
near
perfect
and
then
a
nice
brown
ale
base
in
there
to
round
it
out
pretty
bummed
this
guy
was
basically
flat
great
flavor
overall
but
always
tough
to
really
judge
a
brew
without
the
proper
mouthfeel
3
0
d
hard
to
put
this
beer
at
anywhere
other
than
average
it
has
potential
and
will
probably
be
a
lot
better
next
time
if
they
reuse
the
same
barrels
but
it
definitely
needs
some
more
body
better
carbonation
and
a
lot
more
time
with
the
bugs
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
easiness
and
drinkability
for
the
style
starting
from
the
aroma
from
the
very
beginning
things
started
out
well
blended
you
get
pretty
much
all
the
components
at
once
offering
immediate
complexity
depth
and
warmth
through
all
of
the
solid
woodiness
sourness
and
maltiness
i
actually
had
to
remind
myself
to
take
sips
every
now
and
again
in
between
having
my
nose
constantly
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
flavoring
followed
beautifully
but
was
unique
for
the
style
in
the
sense
of
how
clean
it
was
there
was
just
enough
residual
dextrin
sweetness
to
balance
the
immense
pucker
and
bite
of
not
only
the
yeast
but
of
the
wood
too
without
tipping
the
scales
in
the
overly
malty
direction
the
soft
slurp
helped
to
ease
some
of
this
bitterness
as
well
making
it
undeniably
palatable
this
is
a
fantastic
wellblended
beer
and
we
are
so
grateful
to
have
gotten
to
drink
it
a
solid
beer
post
drinking
reflection
on
this
leads
me
to
remembering
its
smell
as
its
best
feature
although
there
is
a
sexy
semitransparent
reddish
color
and
oatmeal
tinted
inch
of
head
all
i
can
think
about
is
the
nose
which
was
just
so
sour
acidic
and
welcomed
been
saving
this
one
for
just
the
right
occasion
and
finally
it
came
today
id
call
this
more
of
a
flemish
red
than
an
oud
bruin
but
whats
it
really
matter
the
nose
is
dry
red
malt
bacterial
yeasts
and
a
sour
cherry
or
raspberry
touch
thats
more
jammy
than
fresh
fruit
plenty
of
acid
in
the
feel
its
obvious
before
any
real
flavor
sets
in
but
there
is
plenty
of
oak
piquant
yeast
and
residual
sugar
in
this
beer
its
amazing
how
drinkable
this
is
as
the
sourness
doesnt
suck
all
the
moisture
out
of
your
mouth
like
some
and
the
fruit
is
way
way
back
there
like
you
have
to
dig
to
find
it
maybe
a
little
too
acidic
in
terms
of
feel
but
the
carbonation
is
right
on
and
at
just
past
7
abv
i
could
comfortably
drink
this
all
day
i
think
an
exemplary
version
of
the
flemish
red
style
so
interesting
that
its
listed
otherwise
but
that
happens
nose
is
its
best
feature
but
sensational
all
around
if
squatters
had
better
distribution
this
would
be
world
renowned
nearly
full
marks
o
great
surprise
by
far
the
best
offering
from
squatters
or
wasatch
ive
had
very
strong
flavors
that
have
an
awesome
complexity
weve
been
funkified
lacto
pedio
and
other
wild
beasts
sat
in
a
barrel
with
this
beer
for
529
days
and
it
shows
so
complex
and
interesting
a
damn
fine
example
of
the
sour
beer
movement
thats
currently
tempting
palates
in
the
us
today
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
one
couldnt
make
up
its
mind
between
a
flanders
red
and
an
oud
bruin
and
the
medicinal
fruit
character
was
detracting
o
good
overall
missing
some
of
the
fruitiness
id
expect
in
the
style
especially
the
cherry
aspects
but
has
a
nice
sournesstartness
tons
of
funk
which
i
really
enjoy
fairly
simple
flavor
profile
overall
but
still
very
enjoyable
this
is
an
amazing
beer
as
good
as
any
of
the
oud
bruins
ive
tried
i
highly
recommend
it
to
lovers
of
the
style
and
also
to
those
wishing
to
discover
this
style
at
its
most
easy
drinking
this
is
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
it
is
a
very
sharp
and
acidic
there
is
lots
of
depth
of
flavor
but
at
this
time
i
dont
feel
like
it
blends
together
very
well
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
sourwilds
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
nearly
couldnt
finish
my
glass
and
even
when
tackling
the
rest
of
the
bottle
that
noone
else
wanted
i
still
had
a
rough
time
finishing
it
after
sampling
a
few
other
beers
overall
a
nice
beer
a
good
amount
of
sour
here
decent
drinkability
flavors
of
apple
butter
dried
tart
cherry
somewhat
cidery
but
balanced
with
a
mild
sourness
overall
light
oak
dryness
wet
straw
and
smooth
malty
flavors
blend
seamlessly
with
its
fruity
tart
overtones
low
on
vinegaracetone
if
at
all
pretty
clean
and
balanced
drinkability
is
high
as
the
palate
acclimates
to
the
mellow
sourness
easily
will
seek
out
my
own
bottle
in
the
future
a
perfect
beer
for
the
autumn
season
o
this
was
an
enjoyable
sour
really
tasty
and
easy
drinking

the
epic

with

no
real

mention
which
is
surprising
given
the

red
for
sure
especially
for
utah
a
bit
muddled
and
could
use
some
tweaking
but
quite
nice
as
it
is
o
this
one
was
pretty
good
it
could
use
a
bit
more
tartness
but
it
really
isnt
a
big
deal
it
is
nothing
mind
blowing
just
a
solid
flanders
im
starting
to
dig
these
sour
offerings
from
squatters
i
hope
they
make
some
more
well
this
seems
like
a
good
start
really
enjoyed
this
unfortunately
i
dont
have
much
else
to
compare
it
to
very
enjoyable
experience
though
not
a
bad
oud
bruin
particularly
for
those
who
like
them
more
sour
the
champagne
yeast
gives
it
an
interesting
lighter
character
overall
after
being
a
little
letdown
by
the
root
cellar
last
night
the
529
was
impressive
not
bracingly
sour
this
is
more
of
a
harmonious
and
balanced
sourness
as
mentioned
above
the
cork
can
be
tricky
and
mine
was
a
slow
gusher
be
ready
with

finish
the
sulfur
is
a
bit
of
a
problem
on
the
nose
but
the
fruitiness
of
this
beer
is
awesome
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
very
soft
sweetness
starts
to
become
noticeable
it
is
mostly
dominated
by
the
tartness
here
but
does
help
to
boost
the
fruit
character
just
a
touch
more
a
second
pour
sees
me
noticing
more
raspberry
flavors
than
i
did
before
as
well
as
some
more
nondescript
berry
flavors
i
am
finally
noticing
the
oak
character
in
the
nose
as
well
with
a
general
spiciness
as
well
as
a
nice
oakplank
woodiness
this
is
quite
tasty
it
is
perhaps
lacking
a
touch
more
complexity
but
this
is
certainly
no
slouch
i
like
the
subtleness
of
the
oak
here
it
is
quite
well
integrated
and
really
accentuates
the
other
flavors
as
opposed
to
showing
them
up
d
wow
this
beer
is
hard
to
not
drink
i
feel
guilty
for
not
sharing
this
with
anyone
but
at
the
same
time
will
have
no
problem
drinking
the
whole
750
the
thing
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
the
sour
is
incredibly
noticeable
but
doesnt
dominate
the
beer
the
malt
shines
and
you
can
even
notice
a
few
hops
which
makes
this
incredible
highly
recommended
and
im
extremely
happy

around
good

with
the
modest

sour
this

really
is
designed
to
mature
for

this

sour

somewhat

going

the
typical

really
which
is
good
gets
a

thin

a
bit
too
early
in
my
opinion
but
what
is
there
is
nice
i
could
certainly
go
for
more
of
this
though
definitely
not
at
the
price
point
overall
i
tried
this
beer
during
a
store
tasting
and
it
was
much
better
than
this
bottle
something
could
have
occurred
during
the
secondary
fermentation
in
the
particular
bottle
because
the
beer
was
uncarbonated
and
not
nearly
as
sour
as
before
on
the
higher
side
of
my
beer
spending
limits
going
at
11
bucks
for
12
7oz
o
a
idk
if
id
risk
buying
this
again
for
10
bucks
a
bottle
just
to
have
another
bad
cap
another
classic
oud
bruin
its
really
sour
more
sour
than
many
others
drinking
more
like
lambic
or
gueuze
without
a
ton
of
malt
color
or
nose
leaning
me
towards
a
brown
hazy
pale
color
with
just
light
brown
hints
some
blonde
in
there
the
nose
is
really
tart
lemon
acid
lactic
sourness
all
the
usual
bacterial
suspects
distinctly
belgian
but
i
dont
get
the
roast
brown
malt
base
that
makes
the
style
what
it
is
as
a
sour
its
outstanding
but
as
an
oud
bruin
its
a
little
short
on
the
grain
side
in
body
too
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
heft
of
others
but
its
sourness
already
limits
how
quick
i
can
drink
it
it
almost
burns
my
lips
havent
had
one
this
sour
in
some
time
really
a
ton
of
acid
on
it
lemon
notes
as
it
burns
on
the
way
down
its
missing
malt
flavor
and
body
for
it
to
be
right
on
for
the
style
but
the
flavor
is
just
awesome
as
a
sour
great
tartness
beyond
refreshment
fun
beer
my
first
from
these
guys
taste
starts
dry
and
sour
with
cider
vinegar
building
in
the
middle
then
finishing
mild
and
dry
with
hints
of
apple
the
midbody
is
rough
and
has
too
strong
cider
vinegar
notes
compared
to
petrus
oud
bruin
this
offering
from
brouwers
verzet
is
rough
around
the
edges
2012
edition
o
not
bad
but
far
better
examples
of
an
oud
bruin
out
there
othis
beer
was
a
disappointment
im
not
sure
how
much
of
the
low
score
i
can
chalk
up
to
the
bad
seal
the
beer
didnt
taste
overly
oxidized
so
i
doubt
the
cap
was
completely
bungled
but
i
have
certainly
had
better
flanders
red
style
beers
than
this
one
perhaps
with
a
little
carbonation
this
beer
would
improve
but
even
with
proper
carbonation
i
suspect
this
would
be
a
relatively
simple
example
of
the
style
note
2013
vintage
o
enjoyable
but
definitely
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
that
i
have
tried
definitely
a
sipping
beer
due
to
the
tartness
and
it
leaves
you
slightly
thirsty
after
drinking
it
a
little
disappointing
pours
more
brown
than
red
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
sour
but
lacks
depth
i
want
some
earthiness
some
vinous
notes
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
the
sour
none
are
there
the
taste
starts
off
very
much
like
seltzer
carbonated
watery
and
with
a
touch
of
minerality
and
only
after
a
couple
of
heartbeats
do
the
sour
flavors
kick
in
same
problem
as
the
aroma
mostly
just
a
thin
sourness
with
no
real
dimension
to
it
the
finish
is
fine
with
the
sour
notes
being
nipped
very
slightly
by
a
tad
of
welcome
bitterness
perhaps
from
wood
i
had
high
hopes
for
the
beers
from
this
brewery
but
so

nothing

will
be
happy
to
stick
with

altogether
an

i
dont

i
could
drink
very

id
had
this
beer
a

times
on

and
not
been
very

it
is
a

beer
you
need
to
sit
down
with
it
and
give
it
an

do
that

you
wont

the

definitely
hit
the

with
them
a
wonderful

great
attempt

similar

the

in

this
is
an
exceptional
first
sour
from
modern

i
really
hope
they
continue
to
make

seemed
slightly
expensive
for
an

look

if
they
just

pretty
dry
finish
not
that
impressive
imo
the
sweetness
was
pretty
cloying
o
it
was
a

subdued
would
be
a

to
sour

because
their
was

vinegar
is
the
main

i
get
and
the
overall

taste
is

dark

grapes
and
oak
same
thing
everything
is
just
a
little
weak
and
subdued
it
definitely
could
use
more

feel
is
very
light
and
refreshing
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
kind
of
misses
the
mark
for
me
cheers
clear
red
pour
with
a
nicely
sized
white
head
the
lacing
is
ok
not
nearly
as
acidic
of
a
smell
as
i
was
expecting
abut
of
vinegar
and
some
dark
fruits
mostly
like
cherries
sort
of
tastes
unlike
other
flanders
reds
ive
had
the
cherries
and
funk
are
present
but
dont
take
over
the
flavor
its
very
light
overall
with
a
funk
taste
finishing
it
off
light
and
seemingly
under
carbonated
weird
aftertaste
this
was
a
bit
strange
not
what
i
was
expecting
o
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
nice
slab
of
beef
the
flavors
are
very
complex
and
not
really
what
id
expect
from
something
thats
ostensibly
a
sour
but
it
was
so
interesting
that
i
had
to
keep
trying
more
this
is
okay
to
drink
but
just
far
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
really
jarring
for
this
style
do
not
drink
this
got
this
at
the
2010
gbbf
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
minimal
head
but
a
decent
lacing
and
a
very
smooth
but
thin
mouthfeel
very
pronounced
aromas
of
mainly
cherry
fig
prune
and
christmas
cake
taste
is
similar
but
muted
so
that
you
get
the
cherry
but
it
is
more
artificial
and
the
cake
is
a
but
stale
tasing
very
easy
to
drink
and
although
i
coul
ddrink
this
all
day
there
are
many
other
i
would
rather
try
ad
the
flavor
gets
rather
dull
unfortunately
the
beer
is
very
sweet
which
drowns
out
the
tartness
at
first
a
caramelized
fruitiness
reminds
me
of
plums
oxidized
apple
and
berry
flavors
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
for
the
style
which
is
clearly
the
product
of
excess
sugars
flavors
of
sherry
a
nutty
note
in
the
finish
as
well
as
a
faint
tartness
struggle
to
be
noticed
underneath
the
oppressive
sweetness
this
is
really
way
too
sweet
it
is
almost
saccharine
like
and
really
isnt
the
way
i
prefer
this
type
of
beer
after
consulting
the
bartender
i
chose
this
guy
over
the
duvel
green
maybe
next
time
thanks
shelly
it
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
deep
dark
brown
with
a
bit
more
than
a
finger
of
dark
ecru
froth
on
top
the
nose
comprises
figs
soap
raisins
bubblegum
clove
dark
malts
and
brown
sugar
sweeter
than
i
pictured
but
tasty
nonetheless
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
with
notes
of
brown
sugarcinnamon
molasses
subdued
black
cherries
dark
malts
plums
red
apple
skin
exhibiting
a
subtle
tartness
raisins
and
prunes
the
body
is
medium
with
light
carbonation
and
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
im
glad
i
chose
this
brew
as
its
a
nicely
different
flavor
profile
than
im
used
to
especially
when
compared
with
the
seeming
standard
taste
that
i
imagine
duvel
green
has
d
i
thought
this
was
ok
but
way
to
sweet
for
me
didnt
get
much
sourness
or
tart
just
a
lot
of
sweetness
wouldnt
look
to
try
again
its
overall
thin
in
body
with
a
slight
sour
flavor
its
not
that
great
there
is
some
sweetness
in
there
as
well
ive
definitely
had
better
flanders
d
super
quaffable
despite
the
offstyle
characteristics
it
certainly
could
use
a
little
more
tartness
but
its
very
drinkable
nonetheless
o
my
only
knock
on
this
beer
is
the
almost
too
harsh
of
a
burn
from
the
alochol
other
than
that
i
like
it

this
was
a

i
am
beginning
to
release
a

tastes
like
a

i
still
absolutely
love
the

not
awful

of

out

a

clear

no

no

just
deep
rich

a
decent

that
fades
a

quickly
but
leaves
a

the
malt

sweet
with
very
mild
hops
aroma
flavor
is
rich
and

some

more
would
destroy
this

no

perfect
i
love
this
beer
this
brewery
never
fails
to
impress
the
beer
has
a
good
alc
content
without
any
of
the
winey
off
flavors
twang
or
sourness
i
could
drink
this
all
night
might
regret
it
later
with
the
6

22oz

but
damn
it
is
good
looks

this

to
compliment
its

juicyfunky
character
muscles
with
this
beer
in
the
stock
butter
cheese

with
this
one
should
do
the
worst
grand
teton
beer
out
there
at
least
the
2013
batch
that
ive
had
and
its
not
close
this
is
not
an
oud
bruin
a
far
cry
from
it
really
no
sourness
whatsoever
no
lactic
tartness
or
even
funk
i
dont
know
what
went
wrong
here
and
if
it
didnt
taste
okay
i
would
score
it
far
lower
as
a
belgian
brown
its
okay
as
an
oud
bruin
its
an
utter
embarrassment
hazy
light
brown
amber
liquid
with
some
density
and
a
patchy
airy
half
inch
of
tan
head
it
smells
fruity
like
apples
esters
from
a
funny
belgian
yeast
dominate
stale
brown
ale
malts
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
caramel
grains
all
bounce
around
nowhere
is
wild
fermentation
nowhere
is
funky
yeast
and
nowhere
is
any
sign
of
the
beer
this
claims
to
be
grand
teton
is
an
awesome
brewery
they
make
nothing
but
unique
and
well
crafted
beers
all
of
them
but
this
is
an
abomination
sweet
fruit
rotting
apples
caramel
malt
and
stale
belgian
yeast
all
collide
in
a
beer
i
dont
care
to
ever
taste
again
ive
heard
a
lot
of
different
takes
on
what
the
deal
is
with
this
but
i
can
only
gather
its
a
mistake
that
should
have
never
been
released
an
okay
brown
ale
not
an
oud
bruin
avoid
this
one
at
all
cost
home

i
am
really
impressed
with
the
appearance
on
this
beer
a
moderately
aggressive
pour
down
the
middle
of
the
glass
produced
a
three
finger
fluffy
off
white
head
it
has
slowly
dissipated
leaving
half
a
finger
of
tight
bubbles
carbonation
is
streaming
off
the
bottom
of
the
glass
color
is
a
cloudy
burnt
orange
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
becoming
a
deeper
amber
in
the
center
the
nose
is
a
little
bland
with
belgian
yeast
esters
taking
over
most
of
the
aroma
a
slight
caramel
malty
sweetness
is
detected
as
well
as
a
mineral
earthyness
there
is
maybe
a
tiny
hint
of
funk
taste
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
up
front
i
get
caramel
sweetness
and
a
traditional
belgian
ale
yeast
taste
in
the
middle
of
the
palate
i
start
to
get
the
slightly
sour
notes
my
mouth
puckers
for
a
moment
but
on
the
back
end
it
is
taken
over
by
an
earthy
bitterness
that
is
a
little
overwhelming
dry
finish
i
get
where
other
reviewers
have
been
coming
from
i
would
have
really
liked
the
earthy
bitterness
to
at
the
back
end
to
have
been
replaced
by
a
puckering
sourness
to
complement
the
caramel
sweetness
that
said
a
highly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
ale
and
perhaps
serves
as
a
good
introduction
to
sour
beers
overall
meh
wouldnt
seek
it
out
really
sort
of
tastes
like
it
is
too
young
needs
time
to
develop
character
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
has
both
a
sweet
and
slightly
tart
aftertaste
this
is
a
different
type
of
flanders
oud
bruin
than
i
am
used
to
but
i
like
it
o
a
great
representation
of
the
style
and
im
happy
to
see
that
an
american
brewery
is
pulling
it
off
so
well
recommended
even
if
its
just
to
use
the
bottles
artwork
in
your
interior
decorating
final
thoughts
an
average
representation
of
the
style
none
of
the
slightly
sour
notes
id
hoped
for
or
anticipated
i
disliked
the
beer
and
was
somewhat
underwhelmed
and
confused
almost
seemed
like
grand
teton
should
have
allowed
the
lacto
and
brett
to
age
out
a
few
more
months
that
would
have
provided
for
a
more
sour
and
less
sweet
beer
would
not
buy
again
or
recommend
sorry
guys
o
not
a
great
beer
i
dont
enjoy
this
very
much
oi
was
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
lacked
many
of
the
sour
acidic
vinous
characteristics
that
make
an
oud
bruin
an
oud
bruin
instead
there
is
a
mildly
sweet
prune
flavor
some
bitter
metallic
tastes
and
an
earthiness
that
literally
tastes
like
mud
im
not
sure
if
this
batch
was
off
or
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
will
not
be
looking
for
this
brew
again
o
malty
without
any
acidity
really
grand
teton
seems
to
have
some
major
problems
whenever
they
use
souring
yeastbacteria
as
the
beers
ive
tried
that
are
advertised
as
sour
never
are
i
dont
taste
much
brett
or
any
hint
of
sourness
bottled
on
date
is
not
quite
legible
but
2013
sometime
a
hint
of
fruit
that
makes
me
think
of
the
cheap
passion
fruit
juice
in
the
supermarket
cooler
a
touch
of
butter
just
enough
bitterness
and
dark
nastiness
to
keep
it
from
being
a
good
soda
pop
this
just
seems
like
a
lot
of
trouble
for
a
sweet
soupy
brew
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
for
10
25
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
at
least
they
had
the
decency
to
put
a
cap
on
it
instead
of
the
cork
nonsense
oud
bruin
pours
a
reddish
color
with
no
head
their
is
a
nice
mellow
fruity
and
sour
aroma
the
taste
is
slightly
fruity
and
sweet
a
bit
sour
and
has
a
nice
yeasty
undertone
full
flavor
but
the
carbonation
is
a
too
light
overall
its
an
enjoyable
beer
and
a
rather
average
one
at
that
taste
is
similarly
illdefined
and
more
in
line
with
a
dubbel
or
bsda
not
sour
not
even
tart
unfortunately
6
months
of
cellar
conditioning
has
done
very
little
a
vague
tangy
bitterness
and
some
nutmeg
toasted
malt
a
little
sweet
at
first
then
dry
and
oddly
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
definitely
hasnt
seen
a
barrel
or
even
oak
chips
this
beer
was
a
waste
of
money
and
a
sad
distant
facsimile
of
an
otherwise
unique
style
out
of
my
40
oud
bruin
reviews
this
appears
to
be
the
third
worst
after
bourgone
des
flanders
and
rivertown
pestilence
taste
is
sweet
malted
yeast
no
acidity
or
sourness
whatsoever
way
too
sweet
for
an
oud
bruin
taste
like
a
brown
ale
brewed
with
belgian
yeast
which
is
not
a
good
combination
i
had
a
few
gulps
at
this
and
poured
the
rest
down
the
sink
sorry
grand
teton
love
your
beers
but
this
one
is
a
total
misfire
this
is
not
bad
just
fairly
tame
i
like
in
your
face
vinegary
acidity
probably
the
only
style
that
i
enjoy
over
balance
i
dont
want
to
say
disappointed
but
not
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
thoroughly
fails
to
live
up
to
its
stylistic
description
there
is
almost
no
acidity
and
while
there
is
a
little
funk
in
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
a
sort
of
imperial
brown
ale
not
something
i
would
drink
again
and
a
bit
ofa
disappointment
overall
fairly
boozy
and
sour
with
a
nice
belgian
yeast
presence
i
havent
had
too
many
of
these
but
this
one
seems
to
have
many
elements
making
it
complex
pours
a
murky
dark
orangered
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
slightly
sour
and
tart
with
malt
grain
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
slight
sour
fruit
and
caramel
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
pretty
disappointing
for
the
style
maybe
i
will
buy
a
bottle
and
let
it
age
for
awhile
to
let
the
various
cultures
work
their
souring
magic
on
this
beer
kinda
of
disappointing
hard
to
review
far
from
fitting
the
style
not
sure
if
it
just
needs
more
time
or
what
but
it
doesnt
fit
the
category
much
more
of
a
belgian
a
good
brew
but
just
not
close
to
what
i
was
expecting
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
slight
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
alcohol
sourness
slight
pale
malt
and
dark
citrus
it
smells
more
like
slightly
sour
belgian
tripel
than
a
flanders
oud
bruin
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
a
moderate
level
of
sourness
tastes
of
sourness
grapes
alcohol
sweet
malt
slight
hops
yeast
and
slight
pale
malt
overall
while
this
is
a
tasty
beer
it
is
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
i
prefer
fobs
to
be
more
sour
though
the
blend
in
this
beer
is
quite
good
but
overall
its
sweet
fresh
and
complex
especially
when
you
drink
it
to
enjoy
it
and
not
overthink
it
with
a
little
more
time
to
mellow
i
drank
this
one
about
2
months
after
it
was
bottled
itd
likely
be
great
in
both
worlds
we
really
dig
how
the
tartness
is
mellow
and
not
inyourface
like
other
oud
bruins
weve
tried
this
beer
is
proof
that
some
american
brewers
can
brew
just
as
well
as
their
belgian
counterparts
a
plate
of
beerbraised
spareribs
would
do
the
trick
for
a
pairing
especially
as
it
warmed
some
became
a
more
drinkable
beer
but
that
does
not
take
away
from
its
deficits
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
short
head
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
bandaid
to
it
and
then
transitions
into
some
acetic
sour
and
funky
barnyard
smells
right
on
the
edge
of
being
too
much
and
the
bandaid
is
already
pushing
it
over
the
brink
thankfully
all
of
this
mellows
a
bit
in
the
mouth
the
taste
has
some
nice
more
restrained
barnyard
elements
and
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
a
bit
of
rubberband
creeps
in
but
its
not
overbearing
and
doesnt
detract
as
much
as
it
distracts
a
bit
much
overall
and
a
little
rough
in
the
mouth
i
wouldnt
say
they
have
this
style
down
pat
but
i
love
the
fact
that
more
breweries
are
producing
beers
like
this
and
taking
up
the
challenge
pretty
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
regardless
light
and
refreshing
it
is
one
tasty
brew
but
it
is
hard
to
take
as
an
oud
bruin
yes
there
is
some
tartness
and
funkiness
but
very
little
it
is
somewhat
acidic
but
mostly
fruity
and
malty
with
a
nice
dry
finish
it
does
not
really
fit
the
expected
profile
but
it
is
still
a
good
brew
thanks
brewjones
for
the
opportunity
the
drinkability
was
unique
i
drank
it
and
i
kept
coming
back
for
more
not
so
much
because
i
loved
it
but
because
i
kept
wanting
to
figure
it
out
my
brain
and
tongue
were
confused
it
is
a
cross
between
two
styles
i
like
so
i
finished
off
the
bottle
but
i
am
not
so
sure
i
would
rush
to
drink
more
aging
this
has
done
wonders
for
it
only
similar
to
the
original
and
10x
the
complexity
much
much
better
with
some
time
in
the
bottle
i
have
a
couple
more
in
the
cellar
and
am
going
to
try
and
find
the
last
couple
that
may
be
in
town
gts
a
fine
brewer
but
this
ones
a
miss
for
me
it
feels
like
we
missed
out
on
something
because
its
not
flavorful
enough
yet
theres
a
good
flavor
buried
in
there
pours
a
dark
murky
ruby
hue
with
a
big
two
finger
khaki
colored
head
that
dies
down
to
a
thin
bubble
filled
layer
stickiness
is
pretty
damn
good
lacing
all
over
the
place
smell
is
well
different
almost
like
a
wild
ale
with
sour
fruits
and
an
apple
cider
like
aroma
some
wood
like
smells
tingle
the
nose
as
well
taste
is
weak
but
some
fruit
like
flavors
are
mostly
present
apples
cherries
grapes
aftertaste
is
a
woody
vanilla
flavor
not
a
whole
lot
more
in
terms
of
flavor
a
bit
one
dimensional
mouthfeel
is
a
light
to
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
a
bit
tough
for
me
because
of
the
watery
sugar
flavors
this
beer
is
just
about
all
over
the
place
could
use
some
balance
maybe
i
just
dont
understand
the
style
but
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
gald
i
had
the
opportunity
though
poured
into
a
chalice
a
beautiful
cleanclear
light
redmahongy
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
creamy
offwhite
head
some
nice
little
islands
and
sticy
lacing
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
is
malty
slightly
sourtangy
yeasty
some
spices
and
some
nice
caramel
tones
the
taste
is
a
little
sourtangy
enough
for
the
tongue
to
know
its
there
malty
yeasty
there
are
some
spices
in
there
and
a
nice
touch
of
caramel
the
finish
is
alittle
dry
medium
body
wellrounded
brew
very
drinkable
a
nice
and
easy
brew
to
drink
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
thanks
bill
overall
its
a
very
washed
out
and
watery
flemish
even
if
the
flavors
were
bolder
i
think
they
would
not
compare
well
to
other
sour
beers
definitely
not
worth
the
12
its
not
offensive
theres
just
not
much
there
12
ounce
bottle
not
for
retail
sale
sample
very
light
in
color
with
a
filmy
head
sweet
fruits
and
pumpkin
spice
aroma
seems
way
off
for
the
style
flavor
is
absolutely
nothing
like
an
oud
bruin
where
do
i
begin
sweet
beyond
belief
not
sour
at
all
no
barrel
character
was
this
even
aged
in
wood
the
bacteria
cultures
just
didnt
seem
to
work
any
magic
really
really
just
awful
and
a
drain
pour
for
me
i
sampled
this
next
to
russian
river
supplication
and
this
beer
absolutely
tasted
and
smelled
like
nothing
when
compared
to
the
supplication
i
sampled
what
i
believe
was
a
non
bottle
conditioned
sample
so
if
my
score
ends
up
being
against
that
grain
ill
pony
up
and
by
a
liter
further
sips
in
and
the
sourness
is
still
there
but
the
malt
presence
balances
out
the
brew
nicely
i
think
grand
teton
has
done
a
nice
job
within
the
style
im
glad
i
bought
2
botttles
for
myself
and
1
for
a
trade
to
another
fan
of
the
grand
tetons
cellar
reserve
series
this
one
is
imho
another
well
crafted
brew
thanks
grand
teton
thanks
to
jcwattsrugger
for
bringing
this
back
for
me
o
delicious
i
absolutely
love
this
sour
and
it
balances
bacteria
with
yeast
perfectly
in
my
mind
the
only
downside
is
the
shortlived
head
and
the
maybe
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
but
they
hardly
detract
from
how
delicious
this
sour
is
the
color
is
awesome
but
its
not
for
me
o
long
ago
this
was
the
first
sour
beer
i
ever
tried
and
its
a
great
intro
to
the
sour
styles
i
do
not
love
the
aceticvinegar
aroma
believe
its
a
bit
too
strong
but
it
is
an
excellenttasting
very
drinkable
complex
beer
very
good
this
was
a
really
good
sour
but
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
the
fruit
that
was
used
in
fermentation
very
good
and
refreshing
but
i
like
comparable
beers
like
duchesse
better
this
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
a
lot
of
other
sour
beers
ive
had
it
wasnt
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
and
the
taste
is
good
but
not
amazing
but
the
taste
was
rather
unique
at
least
relative
to
the
sour
ales
ive
had
so
i
was
quite
happy
with
this
beer
very
good
beer
just
a
little
bit
of
a
sour
taste
brown
in
color
with
no
clarity
due
to
the
roasted
malts
no
see
through
but
an
attractive
beer
slight
white
quarter
inch
head
after
the
pour
i
would
describe
the
body
more
as
light
even
lacking
substance
slightly
aromatic
fruity
character
but
too
light
to
define
no
hop
taste
low
bitterness
slightly
vinegary
sour
going
in
with
a
slight
sweet
finish
what
was
lacking
in
the
substance
i
also
noted
in
the
finish
the
first
second
and
third
times
that
i
drank
this
beer
prior
to
this
the
beer
was
enjoyable
today
i
drank
this
beer
back
to
back
with
a
2011
rodenbach
which
left
me
dissatisfied
with
this
beer
it
lacked
flavor
and
mouthfeel
and
even
in
aroma
it
is
a
good
light
bodied
beer
for
the
summer
excellent
sour
not
as
sour
as
cuvee
de
jacobins
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing

this

is
bull
crap
solid
sour
ale
very
refreshing
poured
a
fluffy
light
tan
colored
head
that
shrank
down
to

sour
beer
very
one
tone
and
bit
less
sour
than
desired
probably
gonna
get
bashed
for
this
but
i
currently
have
2
bottles
of
this
stuff
left
in
my
fridge
and
all
i
can
taste
is
wine
the
beer
was
ok
i
was
not
impressed
all
i
seem
to
taste
is
whine
like
flavors
and
smells
at
its
pricepoint
paid
4
for
a
single
11
2
oz
i
couldnt
imagine
myself
buying
a
six
of
these
to
share
with
friends
but
on
those
odd
secluded
nights
where
you
just
want
to
try
something
different
this
was
a
good
choice
nothing
spectacular
worth
a
tick
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
its
really
easy
drinking
dont
have
much
experience
with
sours
but
i
will
keep
going
back
to
this
this
was
a
drain
pour
for
me
some
off
taste
i
found
unpalatable
taste
is
very
pleasant
cherry
sour
with
a
slight
sweetness
red
wine
grape
off
notes
mouthfeel
is
prickly
and
entertaining
a
very
nice
approachable
sour
very
pleasant
sour
ale
beautiful
color
light
head
pleasant
aroma
and
a
perfect
sour
finish
i
thought
this
was
a
great
sour
beer
it
was
rich
with
cherry
and
grape
flavors
that
nicely
complemented
the
tartness
i
found
it
quite
different
from
the
lighter
more
citrusy
american
sour
ales
i
have
tried
in
the
past
i
would
drink
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
sour
red
ale
fair
amount
of
carbonation
slight
floral
or
woody
characteristic
poured
slightly
below
room
temperature
about
20
degrees
c
aggressive
head
recedes
to
shallow
but
enduring
light
brown
foam
on
beer
surface
and
minimal
lacework
on
glass
deep
bronze
color
with
slight
reddish
hue
pleasant
cherry
and
lactic
nose
grapefruit
and
cherry
on
entrance
sweet
concord
grape
finish
sweetness
hangs
in
the
finish
a
bit
much
but
still
quite
drinkable
sourness
is
mild
but
present
as
others
have
commented
an
easy
sour
to
approach
for
the
uninitiated
deep
amber
great
nose
of
a
farmhouse
after
rain
wet
hay
a
little
dog
sweet
cherry
approachable
flavor
for
all
who
want
to
taste
a
sour
very
mild
for
a
sour
oud
bruin
this
is
a
good
introduction
to
sour
ales
for
someone
unfamiliar
with
the
bold
sourness
of
something
like
the
dutches
or
cascades
sours
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
sour
ale
not
quite
sour

thought
this
was
a
wonderful
sour
ale
the
appearance
was
a
nice
golden
orange
with
a
thick
head
that
laced
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
grapefruit
from
the
hops
and
then
raspberry
and
cherry
the
taste
was
excellent
in
my
opinion
full
flavors
of
sour
cherry
and
raspberry
mix
with
the
floral
hops
and
wheat
to
make
a
very
refreshing
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thick
but
not
overwhelming
a
new
favorite
of
mine

not

and

i
wasnt
disappointed
with
this
one
i
think
this
is
a
nice
introductory
sour
for
someone
who
has
never
had
the
style
the
nose
and
taste
are
not
so
strong
as
to
be
a
big
perhaps
unpleasant
surprise
but
you
still
get
a
feel
for
the
tart
sourness
of
the
style

overall
a
refreshing
brew
that
i
enjoyed
reviewing
its
slightly
onedimensional
and
could
use
more
character
worth
a
try
nonetheless
o
very
high
id
love
to
have
another
bottlepint4pack
really
nice
solid
mellow
fullflavored
sour
overall
this
would
make
for
a
spectacular
summer
beer
in
my
opinion
light
and
very
easy
drinking
a
beer
with
a
sour
fruit
punch
taste
pretty
good
brew
complex
flavors
and
easy
drinking
o
nice
beer
above
average
for
style
enjoyed
this
beer
a
very
good
sour
overall
a
great
beer
for
people
who
want
to
get
into
sours
but
are
hesitant
to
try
the
extremes
its
not
overly
sour
but
its
got
a
nice
sweetness
to
balance
it
very
refreshing
flemish
sour
o
not
just
a
novelty
worth
drink
as
stand
alone
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
pretty
mild
sour
its
not
bad
however
i
just
find
it
too
sweet
which
i
find
to
be
stronger
than
i
do
the
sourness
of
the
ale
which
i
think
defeats
the
purpose
of
the
style
it
was
pretty
cheap
however
i
might
buy
another
to
cellar
for
a
couple
years
overall
awesome
lacing
on
the
sides
beautiful
color
fruity
tart
low
abv
but
okay
maybe
thats
what
it
is
missing
does
it
earn
a
4
5
i
really
like
this
but
theres
just
something
in
the
finishing
of
the
taste
that
makes
me
think
they
just
missed
something
overall
a
good
flanders
oud
bruin
but
lacks
complexity
might
serve
as
a
good
intro
to
the
style
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
o
i
liked
it
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
was
expecting
more
complexity
that
said
id
still
be
happy
to
have
one
anytime
anywhere
o
an
excellent
example
of
a
belgian
sour
ale
someone
is
going
to
have
to
explain
to
me
why
this
beer
is
categorized
as
an
oud
bruin
and
not
a
flemish
red
ale
at
any
rate
it
is
tasty
and
refreshing
but
lacks
the
depth
of
flavor
and
complexity
of
topshelf
examples
definitely
recommended
for
completists
o
maybe
my
favorite
sour
flavorful
and
not
obnoxiously
tart
this
beer
is
very
consistently
decent
but
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
for
the
style
it
always
leaves
me
wanting
something
more
overall
a
good
but
not
great
sour
o
pretty
darn
good
sour
i
have
often
had
this
be
my
baseline
beer
for
when
thinking
of
a
sour
ale
overall
great
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
its
sweet
with
mild
sourness
very
balanced
and
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
a
great
starter
to
sours
or
for
a
easy
drinker
that
wants
a
sour
but
not
overly
sour
or
bitter
o
a
good
beer
nothing
overly
exciting
but
a
solid
brew
personally
wish
the
sourness
was
dialed
up
a
bit
long
with
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
profile
but
it
is
i
no
way
a
bad
beer

onot
my
favorite
sour
but
not
awful
if
you
are
looking
for
a
refreshing
beer
with
less
sour
notes
check
this
one
out
o
its
a
nice
beer
to
be
fair
but
after
coming
to
the
realization
how
much
i
love
sour
ales
this
isnt
quite
cutting
the
mustard
on
the
plus
side
its
cheapish
and
very
approachable
to
beginners
worth
a
shot
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
of
the
better
sour
beers
out
there
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
my
first
review
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
style
beer
had
a
bunch
of
belgians
the
other
weekend
and
found
i
really
have
a
liking
towards
their
beer
this
one
being
no
exception
pours
a
brownish
red
color
not
much
head
or
carbonation
super
tasty
and
sour
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
some
nice
cherry
tones
in
the
mouthfeel
pretty
good
beer
and
i
like
the
style
might
be
hard
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
as
it
is
its
a
delicious
beer
overall
im
not
that
impressed
a
decent
tasting
oud
bruin
but
the
sour
component
that
ive
come
to
know
and
love
just
wasnt
there
dont
get
me
wrong
a
slight
tartness
stands
up
front
but
its
just
not
got
any
pop
the
belgian
characteristic
here
is
decent
though
an
overall
decent
beer
but
not
worth
the
price
i
paid
3
50
a
bottle
from
the
11
2
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
july
9
2012
it
pours
reddishbrown
with
a
full
puffy
beige
head
that
generally
lingers
the
aroma
has
a
good
cherry
quality
to
it
along
with
belgian
yeast
and
belgian
malts
balancing
it
off
the
body
is
medium
but
it
also
had
an
astringent
bite
to
it
the
taste
was
tart
and
sour
as
promised
but
not
as
much
as
i
thought
it
might
be
theres
a
cherry
flavor
to
it
but
overall
it
lingers
for
some
time
the
flavor
is
one
i
will
remember
o
a
very
safe
sour
ale
for
those
who
arent
familiar
with
the
style
a
very
versatile
beer
to
serve
with
food
as
it
has
enough
flavor
to
pair
with
many
types
of
dishes
but
gets
a
little
tiresome
to
sip
on
alone
i
wish
it
showed
some
more
wild
aspects
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
deep
ruby
red
with
a
two
finger
very
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
half
finger
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
tart
cherry
vinegar
and
strawberry
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
cherry
vinegar
cream
subtle
wood
and
strawberry
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
have
had
this
one
more
times
than
i
can
remember
out
of
the
bottle
so
it
was
really
nice
to
see
this
one
ontap
for
the
first
time
i
was
definitely
not
disappointed
all
of
the
right
flavors
and
aromas
going
on
in
this
one
in
all
the
right
places
a
very
refreshing
brew
that
is
great
for
both
the
beginner
and
the
professional
alike
a
definite
must
try
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
my
first
sour
cant
say
that
this
will
get
me
to
spend
all
my
money
away
on
these
expensive
beers
but
it
has
me
interested
note
i
love
this
stuff
but
id
better
adjust
my
original
numerical
rating
4
88
since
i
have
very
little
experience
with
sours
from
what
i
can
see
in
other
reviews
of
sours
this
one
is
not
an
elite
form
of
the
style
i
shouldnt
be
so
affected
by
such
things
but
i
dont
want
to
be
a
gradeinflator
and
its
absolutely
true
that
this
beer
isnt
very
complex
but
its
so
damn
drinkable
overall
perhaps
its
the
100
degree
heat
today
but
man
this
really
hit
the
spot
i
have
fairly
mixed
feelings
about
sours
but
this
one
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
crisp
easy
drinking
definitely
on
the
sweet
side
puckery
but
not
overly
so
feels
more
like
an
everyday
beer
which
i
havent
seen
in
sours
before
not
very
complex
but
whats
there
is
spot
on
a
good
lemonade
replacement
in
my
opinion
alright
sour
tasty
enough
good
value
at
3
50
a
bottle
overall
a
very
satisfying
wild
ale
with
just
enough
fruitiness
which
allowed
for
a
robust
fruity
beginning
and
a
slight
wine
finish
overall
drinks
nice
the
sourness
is
restrained
o
this
a
a
good
starter
sour
i
thought
id
hate
this
from
the
smell
but
it
is
pretty
good
easily
drinkable
and
a
good
gateway
into
a
very
expensive
style
overall
a
pretty
solid
sour
has
some
nice
tart
fruit
elements
and
remains
fairly
light
and
drinkable
overall
really
nice
not
terribly
complex
but
a
really
solid
beer
overall
i
am
fairly
new
to
the
style
and
mixed
on
this
one
in
particular
i
would
try
to
par
this
with
food
mine
eventually
joined
a
hot
pretzel
with
spicy
mustard
for
a
doughy
spice
kick
which
i
highly
recommend
this
is
a
really
nice
summer
sipping
beer
peter
kate
and
i
all
got
this
and
liked
it
smells
great
good
sour
would
try
again
went
well
with
burger
and
chips
at
tjs
i
would
also
try
other
sours
to
compare
but
it
is
definitely
not
my
usual
preference
o
a
very
easy
drinker
one
of
the
better
flanders
oud
bruins
i
have
tried
overall
this
is
an
amazing
lightly
soured
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
a
the
elements
of
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
in
a
very
satisfying
balance
a
world
class
example
of
the
the
oud
bruin
style
im
definitely
picking
about
a
two
more
four
packs
of
this
and
letting
some
age
in
my
cellar
i
was
suprised
at
the
2
mocha
colored
head
and
while
the
head
did
disipate
the
glass
was
certainly
laced
i
dark
copper
colored
beer
with
some
red
when
held
to
the
light
on
the
nose
i
was
able
to
detect
some
dark
fruits
however
they
were
light
i
enjoyed
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
more
as
the
beer
warmed
up
not
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
and
a
drank
easily
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
beer
sets
you
up
to
expect
good
things
but
it
kind
of
lets
you
down
o
as
my
brother
said
meh
not
the
best
of
the
belgian
brews
or
even
sours
by
far
originally
reviewed
02082011
o
not
my
favorite
sour
but
as
others
have
mentioned
a
great
entry
into
the
style
and
certainly
worth
trying
i
would
like
to
say
this
might
be
the
perfect
amalgam
between
a
geuze
and
sour
as
it
possesses
traits
of
both
o
very
surprised
with
this
one
the
taste
does
not
follow
the
nose
very
well
there
were
many
hidden
flavors
inside
the
beer
that
are
not
present
on
the
nose
overall
they
got
a
good
one
here
m
its
fairly
light
bodied
very
refreshing
o
what
we
seem
to
have
here
is
a
good
introduction
to
the
world
of
flanders
ales
sour
but
not
much
with
a
sweet
undertone
throughout
a
good
beer
for
a
heavy
dinner
or
just
simple
quaffing
overall
a
very
nice
beer
certainly
unique
and
drinkable
probably
not
a
beer
for
everyone
since
it
is
a
little
weird
but
i
quite
like
it
the
combination
of
all
the
aspects
works
very
well
on
draft
clear
ruby
amber
with
a
inch
thick
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
raspberry
and
sour
fruit
taste
is
more
raspberry
sour
fruit
and
light
citrus
thin
mouthfeel
nice
sour
not
the
strongest
example
of
the
style
but
it
was
put
together
well
and
is
very
sessionable
a
not
that
sour
and
way
overpriced
bottle
in
my
opinion
at
nearly
5
bucks
for
a
shortie
i
expected
a
bit
more
pours
a
molasses
looking
redish
brown
color
with
an
active
off
white
head
thats
nice
and
thick
smells
like
tart
fruit
not
brett
or
anything
like
that
notes
of
oak
as
well
as
mild
spice
on
the
nose
flavor
is
sour
cherries
brown
sugar
and
funky
yeast
things
are
balanced
well
but
this
is
a
pretty
tame
version
of
a
flemish
sour
ale
not
puckery
or
tangy
at
all
just
a
hint
of
vinegar
as
it
goes
down
feel
is
nice
bright
bubbles
and
a
medium
body
made
to
feel
quite
airy
by
the
carbonation
overall
a
well
made
beer
but
i
prefer
my
sours
with
a
bit
more
punch
especially
for
the
price
mouthfeel
is
excellent
medium
body
with
moderate
to
full
carbonation
definitely
a
great
example
of
oud
bruin
had
it
on
tap
but
enjoyed
this
from
the
bottle
more
o
i
like
this
beer
this
is
my
go
to
so
far
when
im
craving
a
sour
beer
and
i
dont
want
to
pay
810
bucks
nice
beer
but
not
awesome
o
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
since
ive
been
to
monks
cafe
once
before
and
they
had
a
bunch
of
russian
river
sours
on
tap
among
which
some
i
liked
and
some
i
didnt
however
this
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
sours
ive
ever
had
o
i
am
a
pretty
generous
reviewer
but
this
is
just
unacceptable
maybe
its
better
on
tap
at
any
rate
definitely
not
recommended
i
will
never
drink
this
beer
again
overall
a
nice
starter
sour
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
provides
relief
from
the
vinegary
sourness
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
overall
nice
flanders
looking
for
a
bit
more
boldness
and
more
fruit
flavor
definitely
some
tart
bitterness
but
it
falls
a
bit
flat
after
that
surprisingly
it
is
pleasing
overall
and
refreshing
as
it
advertises
i
would
drink
this
again
if
i
wanted
something
light
but
adventurous
a
solid
beer
but
not
very
complex
a
nice
gateway
to
sours
violet
hints
of
burgundy
with
a
voluminous
beige
head
lacing
is
immaculate
and
retention
is
superb
sour
and
acetic
notes
hit
the
nose
immediately
and
waft
from
the
bottle
balsamic
sour
fruits
hint
of
green
apple
maybe
a
shred
of
sweetness
but
the
sour
notes
dominate
taste
is
a
bit
sour
and
lactic
to
start
not
as
much
as
anticipated
from
the
nose
a
bit
of
copper
oxidation
but
more
sour
fruits
and
a
bit
of
oak
tart
and
more
lactic
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
thins
out
near
the
end
of
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
medium
but
prickly
a
solid
beer
doesnt
blow
me
away
but
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
o
this
was
not
what
i
expect
but
still
a
interesting
experience
once
i
poured
this
brew
it
started
the
roll
coaster
of
enjoyment
and
disappointments
first
i
loved
the
color
then
i
was
disappointed
with
the
head
next
i
like
the
lacy
and
took
a
sip
once
again
it
fell
short
very
nice
sour
but
of
course
a
pepis
or
wild
cherry
pepsi
like
sweet
lastly
i
got
a
bit
of
bread
sour
due
like
taste
then
that
of
course
was
spat
down
but
a
bit
of
bitter
that
came
out
of
no
were
i
love
sour
brews
very
much
sadly
this
is
nothing
spectacular
but
still
nice
at
the
end
of
my
work
day
a
average
sour
brew
with
a
bit
of
potencial
to
be
something
great
overall
i
was
tremendously
disappointed
with
the
brew
it
was
imbalanced
towards
the
sweet
side
of
the
spectrum
and
didnt
have
much
if
any
depth
of
flavor
it
go
down
easily
enough
and
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sweet
easily
drinkable
beer
this
might
be
for
you
odfor
under
4
a
bottle
11
2
oz
this
is
not
a
bad
gig
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
has
not
tried
a
sour
before
wont
blow
you
away
and
it
lacks
complexity
but
it
is
quite
tasty
a
success
d
its
a
decent
beer
though
it
definitely
wont
hit
the
spot
for
someone
looking
for
a
big
bold
sour
may
work
as
an
introduction
to
the
style
o
this
is
good
not
as
complex
or
flavorful
as
some
other
old
browns
but
i
like
it
would
like
to
have
ontap
sometime
o
a
well
rounded
brew
with
nice
complexity
and
quality
i
really
love
these
sour
ales
monks
cafe
pours
a
deep
dark
red
and
has
some
good
clarity
to
it
there
are
plentiful
ruby
highlights
and
maybe
a
finger
and
a
half
of
bone
colored
foam
that
displays
little
in
the
way
of
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
nice
with
some
lactic
sourness
leading
the
way
cherry
and
oak
both
show
up
a
fair
bit
in
the
background
the
flavor
profile
doesnt
pull
everything
off
nearly
as
well
the
sourness
of
the
beer
takes
a
backseat
compared
to
a
sweet
cherry
flavor
and
the
wood
notes
disappear
almost
entirely
it
honestly
tastes
like
someone
took
a
decent
oud
bruin
and
cut
it
with
a
sweet
cherry
soda
the
body
is
fine
but
the
carbonation
is
definitely
a
little
dull
and
it
leaves
the
mouthfeel
feeling
a
little
too
slick
a
times
monks
cafe
is
an
alright
beer
but
its
one
of
the
less
impressive
oud
bruins
ive
had
monks
café
flemish
sour
ale
the
bottle
says
we
blend
young
and
old
beers
to
make
this
mildly
sour
sour
ale
light
bodied
with
a
lacticsour
nose
and
a
bit
of
sweet
and
sour
in
the
finish
very
refreshing
at
recommendation
of
a
colleague
i
picked
up
a
4pack
a
little
pricey
anyhow
poured
from
undated
bottle
to
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
pours
a
deep
copper
brown
color
with
some
ruby
red
edges
in
the
light
a
small
12
finger
white
bubbly
head
with
some
retention
and
lacing
but
nor
much
the
nose
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
aspect
of
the
beer
with
a
detectable
sour
funk
that
melds
well
with
the
sweet
fruity
banana
apple
and
cheery
fruity
character
vinegar
type
aroma
is
detectable
but
not
a
deterrent
hints
of
caramel
malt
sweetness
the
flavor
starts
very
much
the
same
but
is
immediately
overpowered
but
a
strong
sweetness
that
ruins
the
balance
of
the
beer
fruity
and
caramel
sweetness
dominate
the
funky
sour
flavor
and
mellow
characteristics
the
nose
let
on
disappointing
hints
of
dark
fruit
such
as
raisin
in
the
tail
end
finishes
sweet
medium
bodied
and
decently
carbonated
overall
i
feel
the
sweetness
was
way
too
much
for
this
beer
which
is
really
too
bad
i
sampled
2
bottles
to
ensure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
one
to
start
both
were
the
same
i
will
not
be
back
it
was
hard
to
finish
2
but
i
felt
obligated
after
such
a
nice
review
by
a
trusted
peer
perhaps
this
is
a
bad
batch
i
will
have
him
sample
one
of
the
last
2
and
see
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
will
be
looking
to
pick
up
some
more
bottles
of
sooner
than
later
o
this
is
a
very
friendly
flanders
very
light
and
refreshing
would
have
liked
a
little
more
zing
solid
beer
overall
though
o
kind
of
a
bland
sour
no
big
burst
of
smells
nor
flavors
nothing
that
really
stands
out
having
a
little
trouble
with
this
mossy
funk
it
has
to
it
but
i
cant
say
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
in
the
future
o
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
great
summer
brew
no
real
belgium
funk
just
a
refreshing
sour
brew
mouthfeel
champagnelike
mousse
of
carbonation
as
soon
as
it
hits
your
tongue
then
it
gets
very
wet
and
light
as
it
washes
down
awesome
for
cleansing
the
palate
this
is
a
great
after
dinner
beer
and
would
also
work
well
with
conversation
overall
nice
and
easy
drinking
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
this
one
but
a
fine
casual
drinker
for
sure
d
good
flavor
and
mouthfeel
make
for
this
to
be
super
drinkable
the
acidity
is
a
nice
complement
could
crush
a
lot
of
these
o
a
pretty
average
oud
bruin
low
on
the
lactic
and
sour
notes
it
has
some
nice
flavors
and
is
light
enough
to
be
quaffable
but
its
not
my
go
to
for
the
style
i
must
say
that
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
out
of
the
imperial
wine
bottle
that
i
had
had
about
six
months
ago
i
had
a
chance
to
have
this
at
monks
in
philly
awhile
back
but
went
for
other
draft
selections
no
bother
its
not
terrible
its
just
that
there
are
so
many
other
fruity
and
sour
options
out
there
if
it
peaks
your
curiousity
buy
it
and
try
it
if
you
love
the
style
definitely
try
it
ill
leave
it
at
that
all
in
all
this
beer
hits
the
top
of
my
list
and
is
a
great
representation
of
a
good
flemish
sour
being
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
beer
is
all
around
a
good
balanced
beer
sweet
sour
tart
what
else
can
i
say
try
it
like
most
ive
seen
youll
either
love
or
hate
this
style
thank
you
belgium
very
strong
prickly
carbonation
o
a
solidly
made
drinkable
beer
i
give
it
points
for
uniqueness
and
for
drinkability
since
i
would
like
to
and
could
have
several
o
complete
failure
imo
i
love
sours
i
had
yet
to
have
a
sour
that
i
did
not
enjoy
until
now
nothing
about
this
beer
worked
for
me
i
couldnt
even
finish
half
of
the
bottle
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
a
sessionable
beer
as
it
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
that
would
allow
it
to
pair
with
many
different
foods
i
really
enjoyed
the
acidity
in
the
beer
recommended
o
almost
fantastic
but
the
copper
flavor
really
just
ruined
it
for
me
o
this
tastes
like
it
will
cause
cancer
i
honestly
can
not
believe
the
fact
that
the
instore
district
rep
told
me
it
was
better
than
rodenbachs
grand
cru
i
am
absolutely
appalled
it
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
any
sour
flemish
ive
ever
had
i
am
holding
off
on
all
1
0
ratings
with
the
possibility
i
had
a
bad
or
mishandled
batch
but
this
is
honestly
the
worst
red
flemish
i
have
ever
had
this
is
sour
nail
polish
remover
with
cherry
flavoring
o
overall
a
decent
flanders
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
metallic
taste
however
that
metallic
taste
and
smell
was
too
much
for
me
to
take
ive
had
other
sours
before
and
this
is
the
only
one
where
this
came
out
so
strong
alright
ive
stayed
away
from
this
one
for
almost
4
years
after
a
bad
bottle
it
was
really
terrible
likely
infected
in
a
bad
way
revisiting
it
there
are
still
certain
character
flaws
namely
an
unpleasant
aroma
dishrag
and
overcharged
carbonation
getting
past
that
though
there
were
some
nice
flavors
of
grape
and
apple
that
came
out
as
it
warmed
but
still
somewhat
one
dimensional
it
was
prickly
and
overcarbonated
with
astringency
amplifying
the
tartness
none
of
the
sweetness
that
was
present
in
the
2007
bottle
overall
it
wasnt
terrible
but
there
are
far
better
flemish
ales
out
there
namely
rodenbach
la
folie
jacobins
etc
notes
not
the
best
example
of
a
flanders
red
not
even
a
good
one
this
seems
altered
from
a
traditional
recipe
to
somehow
cater
to
the
us
market
skip
this
bastardized
flanders
red
and
go
for
the
real
thing
rodenbach
goudenband
etc
drinkability
i
have
never
had
sour
ale
before
so
i
have
to
say
this
first
experience
was
good
different
but
good
overall
possibly
a
sour
to
introduce
someone
to
sours
or
one
for
those
who
dislike
an
upfront
sour
taste
but
i
found
this
one
lacking
in
the
sour
department
with
a
simple
fairly
muted
taste
profile
overall
this
is
an
interesting
experience
i
wouldnt
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
would
do
very
well
for
dessert
whenever
this
beer
is
on
draft
i
always
have
to
order
a
glass
this
was
so
easy
drinking
for
the
style
and
lower
in
abv
at
5
5
that
i
had
to
order
another
a
very
approachable
reasonably
priced
and
delicious
flanders
oud
bruin
like
it
indeed
12
oz
bottle
into
tulip
i
was
apprehensive
about
this
one
not
only
because
it
was
my
first
sour
but
also
because
i
found
it
after
getting
as
a
christmas
gift
in
2009
heard
a
good
pop
when
i
lifted
the
cap
so
that
was
promising
the
pour
was
a
deep
mahogany
with
a
very
pillowy
thick
tan
head
the
nose
was
at
first
strongly
vinegar
which
put
me
off
so
i
waited
a
little
bit
then
came
back
and
found
that
mellowed
into
more
or
less
a
tart
fruit
apples
and
cherries
with
the
vinegary
undertone
the
drink
itself
was
very
smooth
and
not
as
sour
as
i
expected
there
was
a
fruity
sweetness
up
front
but
the
finish
had
a
nice
crisp
sour
bite
making
for
a
nice
ending
note
i
will
definitely
explore
this
style
more
and
this
one
will
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
for
a
while
skål
o
good
but
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
again
it
isnt
as
tart
as
id
hoped
or
experienced
with
the
style
before
its
a
little
sweeter
than
i
prefer
in
my
sours
but
there
is
still
a
little
sour
funk
going
on
no
one
will
ever
mistake
it
for
anything
other
than
flemish
thats
for
sure
but
not
my
favorite
mouthfeel
follows
the
appearance
at
the
pour
very
carbonated
just
this
side
of
champagnelike
but
fairly
typical
of
the
style
o
more
fizzy
apple
juice
than
sour
beer
lacks
body
more
sweet
than
tart
a
bit
dissapointing
overall
it
is
a
very
straightforward
clean
and
simple
beer
o
dont
know
if
this
is
the
first
of
this
style
ive
had
but
its
not
bad
a
bit
malty
but
a
nice
mix
of
sour
and
sweet
othis
was
my
first
sour
but
after
this
experience
surely
not
to
be
the
last
i
see
this
one
is
pretty
highly
rated
so
it
may
be
tough
to
find
a
better
one
around
here
but
this
has
some
nice
flavors
and
an
acidity
that
i
really
enjoy
every
time
i
try
a
new
beer
i
wonder
why
i
stuck
with
bud
light
for
20
years
never
trying
anything
new
always
consistent
and
always
good
this
is
a
personal
favorite
for
when
i
need
to
have
a
sour
mouthfeel
is
crisp
an
bubbly
but
doesnt
quite
dry
you
out
like
youd
expect
overall
monks
flemish
sour
is
a
great
sour
ale
when
youre
looking
for
moderation
and
mild
sourness
i
e
good
intro
sour
at
2
50
a
bottle
ill
certainly
have
this
again
you
cant
beat
scoring
these
for
4
a
bottle
either
easily
one
of
the
best
in
style
for
the
price
one
of
the
first
beers
one
should
try
stateside
if
they
are
looking
to
get
into
sours
an
excellent
beer
drinks
more
like
a
soda
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
if
youve
ever
dyed
easter
eggs
youll
immediately
recognize
the
vinegary
hardboiledegg
aroma
that
launches
itself
from
the
bottle
and
sticks
to
everything
in
the
room
its
powerful
but
doesnt
assault
as
much
as
the
taste
which
is
acidic
enough
to
etch
your
kitchen
table
so
be
sure
to
use
a
coaster
under
the
glass
theres
a
sour
appleraisin
flavor
somewhere
in
there
too
but
youll
have
to
work
hard
to
separate
it
from
the
vinegar
worth
trying
just
to
compare
it
with
better
examples
of
this
style
e
g
bockor
for
me
though
it
was
a
puckering
struggle
to
drink
the
whole
thing
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice
amber
hue
with
a
slight
bubbly
head
musty
nose
with
raspberry
flavor
is
pungent
and
woody
with
plenty
of
tang
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
i
thought
this
beer
was
delicious
i
never
had
this
style
before
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
it
tasted
like
apple
cider
candy
to
me
apparently
this
is
one
of
those
beers
you
either
love
or
hate
i
loved
it
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
far
as
the
style
goes
so
i
tried
to
review
as
subjectively
as
possible
overall
i
am
quite
impressed
by
the
balance
struck
by
this
sour
ale
others
i
have
tried
stray
too
far
on
the
sour
side
or
are
too
afraid
to
put
enough
in
d
pretty
drinkable
this
pours
a
ruddy
amber
with
thin
foam
lacing
around
the
edges
theres
a
very
apparent
sweet
and
sour
nose
that
makes
its
presence
apparent
not
a
strong
tart
aroma
but
its
there
when
you
nose
it
nice
lightly
soured
flavor
some
dark
cherries
and
oaked
notes
that
carry
over
to
the
palate
light
yet
flavorful
a
somewhat
tannic
finish
considered
a
gateway
sour
for
good
reasonit
doesnt
overwhelm
but
its
obviously
there
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
after
having
tried
others
but
its
nothing
to
turn
my
nose
up
at
for
its
price
especially
its
very
good
this
beer
is
super
refreshing
perfect
for
a
hot
day
or
to
pair
with
an
awesome
meal
at
monks
poured
out
of
a
750ml
in
to
a
tulip
glass
a
beautiful
dark
red
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
of
vinegar
and
what
seems
to
be
some
sort
berries
taste
is
very
similar
lots
of
vinegar
and
fruit
coming
through
good
amount
of
sourness
in
this
one
i
enjoyed
it
the
after
taste
lingering
in
what
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
berries
o
a
lot
going
on
here
which
i
will
have
to
discover
through
many
more
bottles
would
like
to
see
how
this
tastes
with
some
age
on
it
but
will
be
one
of
those
where
i
have
a
difficult
time
aging
when
i
will
just
want
to
drink
it
pours
a
deep
amber
under
a
thin
beige
head
initial
nose
is
primarily
of
soured
sweet
fruits
with
wood
notes
first
taste
is
of
the
big
sour
tartness
laid
immediately
on
top
of
a
sweet
fruity
base
there
is
a
big
woody
flavor
in
the
middle
of
this
one
that
is
just
right
palate
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
almost
creamy
and
the
sweettart
finish
is
just
perfect
i
dont
want
to
sound
patronizing
by
saying
that
this
would
be
a
good
intro
to
sours
for
your
nonbeer
friends
but
it
balances
the
sweetsour
well
enough
that
it
wont
blow
anyone
away
and
to
be
clear
that
balance
is
an
indication
of
the
level
of
craft
gone
into
this
one
o
a
very
nice
beer
pleasant
and
drinkable
in
the
same
way
that
a
diet
coke
is
also
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
d
quite
drinkable
it
didnt
last
as
long
as
i
thought
it
would
o
very
disappointed
here
well
below
average
just
not
very
good
i
am
by
no
means
a
die
hard
of
sour
beer
but
i
did
thoroughly
enjoy
this
it
is
astringentsourtart
whatever
but
i
dont
think
i
would
have
it
any
other
way
overall
a
very
unique
beer
a
very
drinkable
sour
with
a
lot
of
complex
but
very
blended
and
balanced
flavors
for
2
50
a
12
oz
its
not
a
bad
beer
certainly
unique
and
hopefully
the
metal
wont
be
there
next
time
this
is
a
unique
beer
not
one
that
i
would
seek
out
necessarily
but
definitely
a
beer
worth
sampling
solid
flanders
sour
ale
fruity
sour
and
fun
sounds
like
a
bad
navy
joke
id
call
this
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
light
pours
a
dark
brown
w
crimson
highlights
decent
carbonation
and
good
lacing
my
my
snifter
glass
you
can
almost
see
the
other
side
of
the
glass
when
held
to
light
but
not
quite
smell
is
fairly
smooth
for
the
style
tart
a
little
funk
sour
some
acidity
apple
and
cherry
as
well
definitely
on
the
reserved
side
but
good
nonetheless
taste
brings
out
more
of
the
cherry
flavor
with
a
slight
funky
aftertaste
im
actually
surprised
there
isnt
more
funk
in
this
beer
if
there
were
the
score
might
be
a
touch
higher
the
acidity
and
tartness
make
themselves
known
as
well
not
over
the
top
but
you
get
both
out
front
feel
is
good
but
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
would
hope
for
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
definitely
a
good
intro
to
sours
beer
the
funk
is
there
but
its
relegated
to
the
background
worth
picking
up
for
sure
if
youre
new
to
the
style
d
this
is
my
first
sour
beer
and
im
not
sure
what
to
think
it
wasnt
very
enjoyable
but
not
horrible
either
the
vinegar
aroma
really
turned
me
off
but
the
taste
wasnt
as
bad
this
style
seems
like
an
acquired
taste
and
ill
have
to
experiment
with
some
more
examples
overall
this
was
my
first
sour
and
i
must
say
im
pleasantly
surprised
the
flavours
are
all
nice
and
balanced
mouthfeel
is
a
little
abrasive
for
my
taste
but
thats
it
as
the
bottle
progresses
the
sour
and
tart
components
come
forward
along
with
a
slight
musty
flavor
and
distinct
sweetness
somewhat
cloying
but
not
a
malt
sweetness
theres
not
a
lot
going
on
here
making
it
a
great
entrylevel
sour
beer
it
is
also
quite
refreshing
and
could
be
a
fantastic
pairing
with
creamheavy
desserts
o
very
nice
very
underrated
excellent
example
of
its
style
i
actually
kinda
like
this
beer
at
least
when
im
in
the
mood
have
it
had
a
few
times
and
always
have
a
different
reaction
not
as
good
as
something
like
rodenbach
but
similar
i
suppose
as
i
said
its
an
entry
level
beer
for
the
style
and
the
low
price
reflects
that
usually
under
3
bucks
when
i
see
it
overall
impression
i
was
excited
to
try
this
ontap
but
will
tell
you
this
is
definitely
a
brew
that
should
be
enjoyed
by
the
bottle
i
love
presenting
this
to
people
who
are
looking
to
try
new
styles
but
it
was
much
different
ontap
try
it
if
you
can
and
let
me
know
if
you
think
the
same
way
light
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
beer
goes
down
like
soda
the
body
is
light
and
playful
allowing
the
fruit
flavors
to
really
impact
the
taste
buds
without
being
coating
or
sticky
the
carbonation
is
quite
fizzy
and
really
helps
to
make
this
a
beer
you
can
drink
in
mouthfulls
onice
and
light
and
probably
a
beer
more
suited
for
warm
weather
o
a
well
made
oud
bruin
that
isnt
overly
sour
and
has
a
fruit
tangyness
that
makes
it
an
enjoyable
beer
o
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
something
im
going
to
try
to
seek
out
a
bunch
of
id
rather
it
be
a
little
bit
more
extreme
in
the
sour
and
funky
categories
a
good
starter
for
the
style
though
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
paperthin
head
that
slowly
creeps
to
the
glass
of
my
tulip
great
lacing
throughout
aroma
of
sweet
wine
and
lactic
sour
taste
follows
the
nose
tart
but
not
overpowering
smooth
and
sweet
easy
to
drink
where
i
could
have
two
or
three
in
a
sitting
i
love
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
in
color
sour
aroma
cherry
brown

red

belgian
candi
sugar
a
present
lactic
tartness
and
sweet
malt
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
low
to
moderate
i
know
i
have
come
full
circle
i
tried
this
beer
early
in
my
beer
journey
and
couldnt
drink
it
because
it
was
so
sour
and
different
now
its
not
sour
enough
for
me
but
still
a
nice
flanders
style
ale
o
this
was
interesting
really
nice
sourness
with
some
cherry
flavors
o
didnt
hit
my
expectations
just
not
something
i
could
drink
much
of
taste
and
feel
were
taxing
to
get
through
pours
a
rusty
brown
and
color
with
four
fingers
width
of
sudsy
very
bubbly
light
khaki
head
off
of
a
very
easy
pour
there
is
a
audible
crackle
as
it
quickly
fades
down
to
an
inch
where
it
lingers
for
some
time
smells
of
tart
cherries
and
raspberries
and
a
slight
touch
of
sour
apple
taste
is
very
similar
with
a
number
of
muddled
sour
fruits
before
a
sweet
wine
like
finish
mouth
is
quite
dry
after
the
rush
of
sour
overall
a
good
red
ale
that
i
pick
up
infrequently
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
more
economical
choice
in
this
style
pours
a
dark
mahogany
with
reddish
tints
and
a
thin
ivory
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
just
a
slight
swirl
of
haze
nice
aromas
of
slightly
sour
cherry
leather
oak
and
lactic
acid
flavor
follows
the
nose
nicely
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
a
classic
rodenbach
with
with
less
cherry
character
and
more
lacto
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
medium
body
and
good
sharp
carbonation
overall
a
really
nice
flanders
not
quite
on
the
rodenbach
level
but
still
really
good
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
oud
bruin
sour
tart
vinegar
apple
dark
cherry
theres
something
just
cheap
about
the
aromataste
on
this
one
and
the
overthetop
carbonation
just
really
kills
it
reminds
me
of
a
lindemanscheerwine
blend
pumped
full
of
carbonation
seems
more
like
a
sparkly
wine
cooler
than
a
beer
the
first
thing
you
smell
from
the
bottle
is
the
sourness
but
when
you
pour
you
pickup
more
of
the
belgian
yeast
character
its
a
deep
mahogany
crystal
clear
with
a
very
prominent
foamy
head
lots
of
carbonation
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
actually
much
more
sweet
than
it
is
sour
i
was
expecting
a
big
puckering
sour
and
it
tastes
very
rich
and
full
for
being
a
medium
abv
cheers
to
the
brewers
theres
some
nice
raisin
notes
along
with
plum
does
not
leave
any
aftertaste
and
is
very
drinkable
this
is
the
first
real
sour
ale
that
ive
had
other
than
the
fruit
lambic
styles
but
i
could
see
myself
exploring
more
of
the
sour
beer
universe
excellent
mvery
thin
the
carbonation
level
seems
fine
contrary
to
the
appearance
of
the
beer
it
could
certainly
use
more
body
this
might
be
part
of
the
reason
that
the
flavors
have
less
depth
than
expected
however
this
also
means
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
drinking
more
than
a
couple
of
stronger
sours
would
be
very
difficult
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
this
beer
is
unusual
although
a
belgian
ale
theres
something
that
reminds
me
of
a
champagne
fruity
and
smooth
not
hoppy
the
flavor
is
not
as
complex
as
the
best
belgian
beers
but
neither
is
it
bland
like
blue
moon
belgian
white
just
like
champagne
makes
a
tasty
occasional
treat
but
is
not
an
everyday
drink
so
too
is
monks
cafe
overall
while
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
shock
to
the
tongue
and
probably
more
than
a
bit
of
an
acquired
taste
its
still
intriguing
and
seductive
worth
seeking
out
t
not
sour
didnt
see
that
coming
cranberry
juice
cocktail
red
cherries
black
cherries
blackberry
and
apple
cider
with
a
slight
tartness
a
very
slight
hint
of
bread
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
thing
lacking
here
kind
of
feels
more
like
a
fruit
juice
than
a
beer
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
overall
drinkability
not
particularly
complex
but
delicious
nonetheless
again
i
cant
rate
in
style
since
this
is
my
first
of
its
kind
however
as
a
beer
it
is
very
enjoyable
would
go
great
on
any
occasions
where
you
might
want
to
drink
sparkling
grape
juice
well
carbonated
and
light
to
medium
in
body
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
all
the
way
around
i
have
not
had
many
in
this
style
but
i
do
find
this
enjoyable
d
i
really
liked
this
one
dont
pass
this
up
if
your
a
sour
beer
fan
nice
sour
notes
followed
up
by
fruit
flavors
really
make
this
a
unique
drink
experience
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
cpj
for
4
99
bottle
this
is
a
great
sour
and
will
be
one
of
my
default
brews
this
is
a
bit
expensive
but
a
great
side
track
brew
for
the
summer
if
you
ask
me
what
i
would
prefer
instead
of
a
glass
of
champagne
this
would
do
the
trick
sweet
and
dry
at
the
same
time
the
blend
of
two
sours
makes
this
an
extremely
balance
beer
conclusion
it
tastes
to
me
like
this
was
a
traditionally
brewed
oud
bruin
with
a
significant
dose
of
sugar
added
to
round
out
the
sour
and
tart
qualities
as
an
introduction
to
the
style
i
imagine
it
could
be
very
appealing
but
to
myself
i
consider
it
less
than
what
it
could
be
i
love
these
beers
of
this
style
specifically
for
their
dry
feel
and
quenching
tartness
both
of
which
are
destroyed
by
sweetness
in
this
example
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
i
feel
for
the
price
that
there
are
much
truer
and
tastier
options
mouthfeel
is
lightly
medium
with
a
thinly
prickly
feel
in
the
drink
finish
has
a
nice
white
wine
dryness
and
leaves
a
slim
bitter
feeling
didnt
think
that
this
beer
wouldnt
have
the
characteristics
of
other
flemish
sour
ales
but
thats
no
problem
i
actually
want
to
try
an
older
bottle
of
this
to
have
more
of
the
oude
character
coming
from
goudenband
this
is
totally
different
tasting
o
really
super
drinkable
but
its
really
expensive
7
bucks
for
about
12
oz
yikes
this
is
a
great
brew
anyone
who
wants
to
dabble
in
the
sours
i
really
liked
this
brew
and
plan
on
trying
others
like
it
it
had
a
nice
light
body
that
had
a
very
complex
palate
of
flavors
that
made
it
a
great
drink
to
enjoy
its
never
an
overkill
it
actual
quite
refreshing
throughout
im
on
my
second
try
for
this
beer
and
dont
plan
to
change
any
ratings
but
do
plan
to
leave
it
on
my
wants
list
great
stuff
really
tasty
brew
that
balances
its
sweet
and
sour
elements
well
its
hard
to
slow
down
with
this
one
o
i
would
get
this
again
to
help
me
build
a
palate
not
so
acidic
down
my
alley
at
this
point
drink
once
you
get
accustom
to
the
sour
aromas
and
taste
its
a
nice
drinking
beer
however
i
wouldnt
classify
this
beer
as
thirst
quencher
but
something
to
slowly
sip
while
the
beer
is
marketed
as
a
palate
cleaner
i
found
myself
tasting
the
sour
an
easy
10
minutes
after
the
beer
so
unless
you
plan
on
sipping
on
one
or
two
of
these
beers
id
suggest
getting
a
hop
heavy
beer
afterward
to
shock
your
palate
back
to
reality
heres
the
skinny
pours
with
little
head
and
slight
lacing
in
my
book
thats
a
good
thing
i
wanna
get
to
the
beer
not
work
my
way
through
the
foam
i
would
call
this
a
typical
representation
of
a
flemish
sour
low
alcohol
and
not
too
tart
or
sour
for
the
casual
drinker
but
maybe
underwhelming
for
the
seasoned
drinker
on
a
scale
of
1
10
on
the
sourtart
scale
id
probably
give
it
a
4
serve
cold
but
room
temp
aint
half
bad
either
beautiful
red
color
a
nice
lace
left
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
it
not
as
much
of
an
aroma
as
other
sours
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
nice
sourness
that
isnt
overpowering
cherries
stand
out
its
a
mild
sour
compared
to
others
that
ive
had
easy
to
drink
light
body
and
a
good
sour
overall
it
starts
with
a
tart
fruit
flavor
and
sweetens
a
bit
on
the
back
end
ill
try
other
sour
beers
but
i
just
had
too
much
trouble
getting
past
the
funky
aroma
of
this
one
d
coming
from
a
750ml
i
could
easily
finish
this
by
myself
i
would
purchase
again
o
while
it
isnt
as
sour
as
i
had
hoped
for
its
really
enjoyable
sweet
fruit
are
quite
tasty
and
the
level
of
sourness
provides
a
nice
complement
throughout
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
making
it
even
easier
to
drink
as
it
warms
the
tartness
is
amped
up
just
a
bit
but
it
never
reaches
the
level
id
really
like
it
to
be
at
in
terms
of
a
subtle
easydrinking
sour
this
one
hits
the
mark
its
enjoyable
but
could
offer
a
little
more
o
it
wasnt
terrible
but
ive
had
far
better
oud
bruins
this
one
was
rather
weak
and
more
of
a
tart
and
amped
up
grape
juice
just
with
a
cherry
spin
on
it
o
this
is
far
from
a
bad
beer
but
it
really
never
wowed
me
i
liked
the
flavors
but
the
sourness
cut
out
far
too
quickly
and
you
were
left
with
an
overly
sweet
red
ale
o
for
a
sour
not
very
sour
but
i
like
this
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
like
a
little
more
sour
though
overall
pretty
easy
drinking
not
even
sour
quite
sweet
actually
which
probably
knock
my
score
down
a
bit
but
its
a
great
beer
and
a
good
place
to
start
to
get
your
feet
wet
if
you
are
not
into
sour
tastes
i
disagree
with
the
assessments
that
this
couldnt
be
drank
all
night
i
found
this
to
be
very
approachable
almost
to
a
flaw
i
just
wish
that
it
had
more
of
a
kick
for
what
its
worth
at
5
5
i
doubt
youll
find
many
beers
this
potent
though
worth
checking
out
but
id
hold
off
on
buying
in
bulk
leaps
and
bounds
better
on
tap
than
it
ever
was
in
the
bottle
im
so
sad
the
keg
at
the
good
life
was
kicked
while
very
similar
to
the
bottled
version
the
freshness
of
it
from
the
keg
made
for
a
significantly
more
sour
experience
same
look
although
lacing
was
better
better
aroma
and
flavor
a
great
beer
especially
on
tap
m
good
mouth
feel
not
too
heavy
or
overpowering
nice
and
sweet
slightly
sour
was
almost
expecting
it
to
be
a
lot
more
sour
than
it
actually
was
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
one
i
will
try
again
as
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
this
might
be
a
liitle
over
my
head
but
my
palete
could
not
handle
this
one
overall
the
malt
and
hops
take
a
backseat
to
the
sweet
sourness
i
get
a
refreshing
aftertaste
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
very
clean
beer
from
start
to
finish
excellent
beer
to
be
paired
with
cheese
everything
about
this
beer
follows
the
rules
however
nothing
left
me
saying
wow
o
it
is
different
than
i
am
used
to
it
goes
from
sweet
to
vinegary
back
to
sweet
again
o
very
palatable
for
me
but
i
can
see
where
a
lover
of
sours
will
be
disappointed
still
not
a
style
i
would
seek
out
but
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
one
again
maybe
pairing
with
some
blue
cheese
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
flanders
oud
bruin
and
one
that
i
believe
has
improved
with
age
i
have
trouble
palating
this
style
so
i
only
like
to
throw
it
into
the
mix
once
in
a
while
d
high
for
this
style
this
beer
benefits
from
not
being
melt
your
face
overwhelmingly
sour
it
strikes
a
nice
balance
which
makes
it
rather
drinkablerepeatable
and
overall
quite
enjoyable
o
overall
this
was
a
really
nice
brew
im
not
horribly
familiar
with
oud
bruins
but
this
was
certainly
worth
trying
overall
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
sour
ale
it
does
not
come
close
to
some
of
the
nice
russian
river
sour
ales
this
beer
is
just
awesome
it
pours
reddish
mahogany
with
little
to
no
head
i
dont
care
because
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
filled
with
fruit
dominated
by
bitter
sour
cherries
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
low
carbonation
this
beer
does
the
style
justice
and
im
looking
forward
to
enjoying
it
again
very
enjoyable
a
sipper
due
to
the
nature
of
the
style
but
great
drinkability
for
what
it
is
o
mildly
sour
throughout
but
still
sweet
and
drinkable
very
tasty
nice
blend
of
the
tart
and
sour
fruit
flavors
with
the
sweet
malt
this
one
has
a
little
more
sweet
balance
than
others
of
this
style
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
someone
new
to
the
more
sour
beers
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
easy
to
drink
nice
brew
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
im
not
familiar
with
the
style
but
ive
had
other
types
of
sours
so
im
not
totally
in
the
dark
here
its
a
nice
brew
but
there
are
other
sours
i
like
better
worth
a
try
for
sure
this
beer
started
pouring
and
instantly
a
massive
amount
of
head
started
to
form
a
ton
of
carbonation
with
a
lot
of
large
bubbles
a
hazy
deep
ruby
mahogany
color
the
nose
is
all
yeast
with
a
lot
of
tangy
metallic
penny
notes
a
subtle
amount
of
toasty
sweetness
there
is
an
intense
fruity
punch
upfront
a
sour
apple
juice
flavor
a
lot
of
the
carbonation
helps
the
bitterness
which
transitions
to
a
tart
sweetness
for
the
finish
a
nice
tangy
fruit
kick
overall
i
guess
its
not
bad
for
a
beginner
on
the
style
i
am
by
no
means
a
seasoned
pro
with
sours
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
it
is
not
repulsive
but
then
again
it
gives
me
no
reason
to
desire
another
one
11
2oz
bottle
pours
hazy
mahogany
with
offwhite
head
aroma
has
some
vinegar
and
sour
cherries
along
with
some
wood
taste
is
sweet
with
some
souralmost
like
sour
cherry
hard
candy
medium
bodied
with
a
slickoily
texture
not
very
sour
but
would
be
a
good
intro
into
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
not
bad
o
nice
aroma
and
upfront
flavors
but
the
oxidation
was
a
bit
much
giving
it
a
metallic
finish
that
was
a
bit
unpleasant
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
overall
nice
tasty
interesting
beer
o
i
am
still
fairly
new
to
sours
however
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
i
really
like
the
sweet
back
bone
that
cuts
through
the
mild
sourness
some
of
the
sours
ive
had
wreck
your
mouth
wtih
only
a
sour
flavor
and
no
balance
this
is
not
the
case
with
this
brew
real
nice
job
here
overall
this
is
my
second
round
of
trying
sours
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
much
more
impressed
this
time
petrus
pale
last
time
i
am
ready
to
begin
exploring
these
style
further
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beverage
that
tastes
like
a
cross
between
a
sour
beer
and
a
sweet
wine
like
a
reisling
im
just
starting
to
get
into
sours
and
every
one
ive
had
so
far
has
been
different
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
cheers
narrative
these
internet
dating

but
if
they
only
would

oz
bottle
straight
from

into

time

this
style
pours
a
clear
bright
red
with
a
massive
white
head
that
filled
over
half
of
my
snifter
head
receded
after
a
couple
minutes
and
left
slight
lacing
aroma
is
sour
cherries
and
a
little
funk
with
no
hops
or
beer
like
qualities
taste
is
all
sour
cherries
reminds
me
of
the
first
time
i
ate
candy
carbonation
explodes
in
your
mouth
and
reveals
tart
cherries
and
a
sweet
almost
sugary
finish
that
sticks
to
your
tongue
i
couldnt
put
my
glass
down
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
without
finding
myself
wanting
another
sip
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
huge
carbonation
overall
im
glad
i
tried
this
and
will
be
buying
more
on
my
next
visit
i
always
enjoy
trying
new
styles
of
beer
and
this
is
a
prime
example
really
enjoyed
this
one
cherry
red
clear
with
no
head
or
lace
aroma
is
sour
cherries
oak
and
noticeably
acidic
flavor
is
similar
in
characteristic
with
a
very
lively
feel
light
bodied
strong
lacquer
characteristics
in
both
aroma
and
taste
maybe
fermented
apples
is
more
appropriate
i
would
have
thought
the
abv
was
much
higher
pours
a
nice
crimson
color
with
some
really
nice
lacing
after
a
white
head
falls
down
not
much
light
makes
its
way
through
the
nose
has
some
mild
cherry
character
plus
some
sweet
malt
theres
a
touch
of
oak
there
along
with
some
light
acetic
character
a
bit
of
sweetness
carries
through
the
flavor
is
somewhat
tart
with
a
bit
of
acid
along
with
a
mild
acetic
character
a
bit
of
oak
and
cherry
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
has
a
dry
finish
a
decent
example
of
the
style
though
nothing
too
memorable
unfortunately
i
think
i
could
go
for
a
little
more
sourness
over
the
sweetness
but
this
still
makes
for
a
fairly
balanced
and
pleasant
sipper
o
a
very
well
balanced
flavorful
crisp
beer
so
clean
and
enjoyable
and
what
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
awesome
dirtybeerguy
com
a
decent
oud
bruin
but
not
the
best
ive
had
the
flavors
could
be
more
robust
and
a
bit
more
sour
pours
bright
mahogany
with
red
edges
tan
head
smell
wow
butterscotch
cherries
slight
medicinal
taste
wow
butterscotch
sweet
sour
malt
some
lemon
slight
caramel
definitely
complex
yet
i
wish
this
were
a
tad
less
sweet
carbonation
is
high
mouthfeel
is
slightly
slick
i
dunno
if
the
sweet
and
sour
works
for
me
but
it
is
a
different
beer
from
what
i
am
used
to
wanted
to
try
a
sour
beeer
and
this
was
the
first
one
i
could
find
poured
from
bottle
into
goblet
the
color
was
reddish
brown
kinda
like
rasberry
ice
tea
the
smell
was
extremley
sour
fruit
once
this
beer
had
a
chance
to
breathe
the
smell
became
more
pleasant
when
it
first
hit
my
lips
it
was
sour
enough
to
make
me
pucker
the
mouth
feel
was
pleasant
and
finished
with
a
slight
sour
candy
taste
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
overall
i
was
surprised
by
this
sour
beer
and
cant
wait
to
try
different
sours
o
overall
this
is
a
tasty
flanders
there
are
lots
for
this
style
though
and
while
this
is
tasty
im
still
left
seeking
other
better
examples
of
the
style
great
appearance
though
o
im
not
too
excited
about
sour
ales
but
the
elements
of
the
beer
came
together
nicely
for
this
style
i
did
like
this
brew
however
in
the
world
of
sours
i
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
there
are
just
way
too
many
other
offerings
to
choose
from
overall
a
very
unique
beer
that
sort
of
stands
on
its
own
i
will
definitely
use
this
as
a
refresher
and
will
introduce
it
to
both
wine
drinkers
and
soda
drinkers
because
i
think
it
might
be
abe
to
convert
them
to
drinking
beer
overall
a
nice
sour
not
much
id
change
except
maybe
adding
a
touch
more
sourness
o
love
monks
flemish
sour
ale
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
for
me
and
overall
a
delicious
high
quality
beer
i
need
to
find
more
bottles
of
this
on
tap
at
the
thirsty
monk
poured
a
reddish
color
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
smells
of
tart
fruit
apples
cherries
berries
taste
is
the
perfect
amount
of
sour
just
what
i
was
looking
for
in
this
kind
of
brew
green
apples
and
cherries
nicely
balanced
to
create
a
really
refreshing
feel
i
guess
they
eliminated
drinkability
from
the
review
categories
but
overall
a
great
belgian
effort
i
personally
much
prefer
this
to
the
redundant
tripels
and
quadruppels
they
all
taste
like
apple
juice
anyway
this
red
ale
i
highly
recommend
overall
this
is
one
cool
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
in
it
and
a
lot
of
varied
things
will
have
again
d
a
solid
oud
bruin
not
as
strong
as
what
i
anticipated
but
it
is
what
it
is
surprisingly
refreshing
and
a
nice
treat
and
transition
to
have
as
the
days
slowly
begin
to
warm
up
outside
o
enjoyable
beer
just
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
overall
its
a
very
smooth
tasty
drink
so
glad
i
was
able
to
find
some
on
my
vacation
here
in
louisville
would
be
a
nice
treat
every
once
in
a
while
onot
the
best
sour
i
have
had
pretty
runofthemill
actually
but
it
was
refreshing
i
liked
the
sour
finish
and
i
would
recommend
it
for
that
reason
not
a
bad
sour
but
also
nothing
spectacular
about
this
one
either
nice
red
coloring
with
a
light
head
green
apple
tartiness
comes
to
mind
when
drinking
carbonation
is
higher
than
most
sours
in
my
opinion
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
but
hurts
its
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
one
beer
tasting
so
the
four
pack
we
got
ours
in
is
holding
up
longer
than
some
overall
not
bad
basically
what
i
call
the
introduction
to
sours
and
wilds
etc
its
a
light
sour
tart
beer
but
nice
and
malty
at
the
same
time
and
very
drinkable
this
a
good
mix
of
sweet
and
sour
smells
incredible
and
drinks
very
easy
tame
on
the
sourness
overall
a
beer
fitting
its
description
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
an
excellent
predinner
selection
overall
a
nice
introduction
to
flemish
sours
looks
like
ill
be
trying
more
in
the
future
d
this
is
very
drinkable
i
had
misgivings
about
sours
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
it
had
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
was
certainly
different
from
any
other
beer
ive
had
its
not
overly
sweet
or
sour
and
its
very
tasty
dn
this
stuff
is
fing
delicious
picked
it
up
out
of
town
should
have
probably
capitalized
on
it
overall
monks
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
flemish
red
not
as
sour
as
some
of
the
other
sour
beers
i
have
encountered
but
i
really
liked
the
nice
balance
between
the
souring
effect
created
by
blending
the
beer
with
the
sweet
notes
from
the
cherries
definitely
a
beer
to
try
if
you
are
into
sour
beers
drinkability
4
5
out
of
5
im
tempted
to
give
this
a
slightly
lower
drinkability
score
because
both
the
price
and
the
slowlysipping
nature
needed
to
truly
appreciate
it
make
it
a
rather
poor
choice
for
a
session
but
if
you
were
flush
enough
and
so
inclined
you
could
easily
spend
a
few
hours
having
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
great
choice
for
people
who
dislike
hops
wine
drinkers
who
want
to
get
into
beer
and
people
who
love
sour
candy
and
sour
fruits
keep
in
mind
my
bias
this
may
not
be
for
beginners
coming
from
a
macrolager
background
mouthfeel
drinkability
now
that
i
look
at
other
bas
reviews
i
have
to
disagree
with
many
of
the
other
statements
that
this
beer
is
too
sweet
i
believe
it
to
be
very
well
balanced
all
throughout
sourness
and
sweetness
are
sort
of
playing
tugofwar
with
each
other
and
sometimes
sour
wins
sometimes
sweet
it
just
depends
on
each
certain
drink
to
me
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
expected
quite
light
bodied
as
well
while
the
beer
is
resting
in
my
mouth
i
get
the
feeling
that
i
am
going
to
be
overcome
by
sweetness
when
i
swallow
but
when
i
do
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
each
and
every
time
i
take
a
drink
drinkability
certainly
a
balanced
beer
and
something
that
was
nice
to
sip
on
think
i
could
stand
to
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
not
quite
the
beer
i
remembered
dont
recall
the
vinegar
and
also
thought
it
was
more
assertive
still
good
overall
as
ive
already
noted
in
my
smell
section
i
have
a
strange
history
with
monks
cafe
it
was
my
first
sour
beer
and
i
didnt
really
like
it
at
the
time
after
my
first
taste
i
tried
a
few
other
sour
beers
then
when
i
had
monks
cafe
again
i
still
didnt
love
it
but
i
had
more
specific
reasons
for
not
embracing
its
qualities
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
but
its
certainly
not
spectacular
whew
i
enjoyed
this
my
first
sour
beer
at
the
saloon
on
u
street
really
knocked
me
out
i
had
just
read
an
article
on
sour
beers
in
either
ba
or
on
welovedc
decided
to
take
the
plunge
and
order
up
one
of
these
fellows
so
glad
i
did
dominant
dark
fruits
on
the
nose
with
a
bitter
tinge
that
transforms
on
the
close
to
a
sour
and
crispy
finish
the
deep
red
color
with
its
fruity
bitter
smell
coming
out
of
the
top
of
the
goblet
ultramemorable
and
will
definitely
jump
for
a
draft
of
this
when
i
make
a
visit
to
their
philadelphia
brew
house
dthis
is
a
great
beer
would
get
this
to
finish
a
night
all
the
time
havent
had
much
from
this
style
but
i
love
it
great
beer
give
this
s
try
if
you
havent
d
high
d
this
had
great
complexity
and
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
it
had
very
nice
scent
and
taste
with
the
exception
of
the
metallic
sense
body
really
helped
lighten
the
intensity
of
the
sourness
making
this
easier
to
drink
but
its
still
better
as
a
sipping
beer
age
may
help
improve
but
its
very
enjoyable
fresh
a
quality
taste
experience
but
not
one
ill
likely
repeat
d
it
has
good
drinkability
i
drank
this
faster
than
i
thought
i
would
it
has
good
flavor
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
like
this
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
others
of
this
style
monks
cafe
flemish
sour
red
ale
was
redbrown
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
an
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
fruit
cherries
and
vinegar
the
taste
was
sweet
and
sour
cherries
with
some
malt
vinegar
and
buttery
notes
the
finish
was
sweet
sour
and
semidry
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
as
this
beer
kept
me
very
interested
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
worth
a
try
medium
carbonation
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
a
nice
mild
sour
overall
d
i
think
the
serving
size
for
this
beer
is
the
right
amount
i
probably
wouldnt
move
onto
a
second
one
however
the
one
i
am
enjoying
now
goes
down
super
smooth
and
fast
d
a
very
interesting
specialty
belgian
brew
and
at
5
5
abv
its
not
a
stretch
to
try
a
few
the
fruity
floral
esters
of
this
blended
belgian
red
ale
are
balanced
yet
sweet
acidic
tart
and
funky
all
at
once
quite
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
to
maybe
pair
it
with
a
duck
or
wild
turkey
d
drinkability
is
moderate
the
nose
really
had
me
excited
for
this
but
the
taste
is
more
narrow
in
focus
its
a
bit
simple
if
not
tasty
but
the
aroma
had
so
much
more
opportunity
i
wouldve
loved
to
have
this
as
an
introduction
to
more
sour
beers
as
it
is
gentle
and
only
slightly
tart
has
a
very
sticky
and
lasting
mouthfeel
very
difficult
to
shake
4
5
although
i
have
had
better
sours
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
those
just
starting
out
or
to
anyone
who
wants
to
keep
several
on
hand
as
they
are
easy
to
find
and
priced
well
for
this
style
slick
and
heavy
on
the
palate
despite
being
sour
this
beer
just
didnt
really
impress
me
all
that
much
there
are
far
better
representations
of
this
style
out
there
though
i
can
see
the
value
in
this
beer
it
would
be
a
good
training
wheel
sour
for
someone
just
getting
into
the
expensive
habit
im
really
loving
sours
these
days
and
this
is
a
drinkable
and
awesome
example
o
not
too
sour
and
the
balance
of
sweetness
is
good
but
definitely
more
towards
the
sweet
end
the
nose
shows
this
as
it
doesnt
give
off
that
pronounced
sour
aroma
its
in
there
if
you
look
for
it
and
the
beer
has
had
time
to
open
up
not
to
shabby
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
easy
drinking
not
too
tart
but
with
a
pleasant
moderately
complex
flavor
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
edit
docking
the
drinkability
score
a
point
its
wearing
on
me
di
really
like
a
super
tart
and
funky
flanders
and
this
isnt
that
said
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
making
it
more
approachable
than
most
in
the
style
if
i
remember
right
it
wasnt
to
expensive
either
d
not
sure
if
i
would
have
more
than
one
its
a
bit
too
sour
and
over
carbonated
for
me
but
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
granted
this
was
my
first
sour
so
i
would
like
to
try
a
few
others
maybe
i
should
eat
more
sour
apples
for
practice
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
complex
yet
very
drinkable
as
my
second
sour
i
find
it
very
near
the
first
duchesse
de
bourgogne
there
are
some
specific
flavor
differences
and
in
the
level
of
sourness
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
and
will
keep
trying
beers
with
sour
and
acidic
characteristics
poured
gently
for
a
2finger
head
reduces
to
thin
bubbly
film
lacing
is
a
little
runny
color
is
slightly
cloudy
deep
crimsonbrown
with
sediment
aroma
is
a
slightly
rusty
sour
apple
vinegar
and
some
funky
tartness
taste
can
be
described
the
same
but
the
carbonation
really
hits
the
tongue
hard
good
beer
to
share
with
someone
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
flanders
reds
ive
ever
had
smooth
and
balanced
without
a
load
of
sweetness
that
i
can
deal
with
the
sourness
vinegar
taste
is
also
kept
to
a
tolerable
level
worth
seeking
out
for
sure
d
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
i
remember
it
blowing
my
mind
like
it
was
yesterday
id
never
had
anything
like
it
and
fell
instantly
in
love
now
in
the
greater
scheme
of
thing
this
is
a
tasty
brew
but
ive
have
had
better
in
the
style
definitely
a
unique
experience
for
me
would
definitely
try
it
again
and
am
curious
what
its
like
from
a
bottle
sweet
and
fruity
but
lacing
the
sourness
it
needs
at
this
point
its
more
petrus
than
goudenband
one
of
the
first
sours
ive
had
i
found
it
to
be
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
much
carbonation
amber
in
color
with
little
to
no
sediment
not
much
of
a
bite
and
not
too
sour
it
was
sweet
to
the
tongue
and
nose
certainly
worth
a
try
a
smooth
and
light
brew
to
put
back
slowly
overall
fantastic
sour
in
my
opinion
nice
too
sour
but
rather
well
balanced
with
the
sweetness
give
this
one
a
go
very
interesting
its
nice
and
bubbly
but
a
sipper
for
sure
i
found
this
beer
to
be
too
sweet
tasting
and
too
cider
vinegary
smelling
to
give
it
higher
marks
it
certainly
wasnt
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
purchase
it
again
d
a
good
beer
and
i
am
happy
i
tried
it
i
feel
that
some
flavors
and
smells
are
out
of
place
and
was
hoping
that
it
would
be
more
sour
and
less
sweet
d
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
i
can
easily
finish
several
bottles
of
ill
pick
up
more
next
time
this
beer
pours
a
light
copper
with
a
small
off
white
head
with
slight
persistent
lacing
the
smell
is
of
white
wine
vinegar
with
a
sour
note
as
well
the
taste
is
initially
a
touch
of
sweet
white
wine
fading
into
a
moderate
sourness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fairly
dry
the
strong
flavors
in
this
beer
keep
it
from
being
too
drinkable
but
it
is
an
interesting
drink
d
this
is
pretty
standard
for
a
flanders
red
ale
i
think
of
this
way
more
of
a
flanders
red
than
oud
bruin
nothing
outstanding
the
cherry
and
sour
are
presentbut
id
like
to
see
more
oak
and
smoothness
in
the
body
the
vinegar
is
there
and
kept
in
checkbut
i
like
my
vinegar
extra
mild
in
my
sours
overall
i
like
this
and
its
seems
pretty
traditional
overall
its
an
ok
representation
of
the
style
and
is
probably
blended
to
appeal
to
a
wider
number
of
palates
as
such
its
a
passable
sour
but
more
like
a
sparkling
wine
in
its
acidity
than
a
vinegary
or
mouth
puckering
sour
not
bad
if
you
cant
find
other
sours
around
d
i
could
easily
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
which
is
saying
a
lot
for
a
sour
ale
its
also
affordable
for
a
sour
which
is
a
nice
bonus
definitely
not
my
favorite
for
the
style
but
doable
i
can
stick
with
just
one
though
light
carbonation
the
bubbles
that
are
there
dance
on
the
tongue
brut
champagne
character
nice
and
drinkable
good
beginner
sour
poured
a
dark
brown
in
color
with
maroon
highlights
that
had
a
2
finger
head
and
good
retention
leaving
good
frothy
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
upfront
had
big
vanilla
oaky
notes
with
some
vinegar
vinous
and
slight
acidic
notes
the
taste
was
also
sweet
and
oaky
with
vinous
vinegar
accents
but
had
slight
brown
sugar
notes
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
oaky
vinous
and
tart
finish
it
did
drink
good
and
was
a
decent
flanders
style
beer
its
important
to
note
that
this
was
my
first
taste
of
a
sour
ale
not
having
had
a
wild
ale
or
lambic
either
overall
i
thought
it
was
interesting
but
honestly
it
is
a
style
i
probably
wont
be
visiting
again
anytime
soon
its
not
terrible
i
just
dont
find
the
vinegar
and
lactic
qualities
that
enjoyable
and
dont
think
of
the
flavors
or
mouthfeel
as
beer
i
know
it
is
an
ale
by
definition
i
regretted
ordering
this
after
the
first
sip
but
i
didnt
want
to
kill
myself
while
drinking
the
rest
of
it
so
i
guess
thats
a
plus
i
will
definitely
not
be
ordering
this
again
we
need
more
good
sours
to
come
to
texas
so
i
dont
have
to
subject
myself
to
this
as
one
of
our
few
options
overall
ive
had
this
beer
ontap
at
monks
cafe
in
philadelpia
and
bottled
either
way
you
lose
while
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
incredibly
average
d
it
was
very
disappointing
i
love
sours
and
felt
this
was
a
weak
representation
ive
had
beers
not
in
the
sour
category
that
had
more
sour
to
them
it
might
be
a
good
beer
for
someone
who
is
just
getting
into
sours
or
just
isnt
looking
for
that
wonderful
kick
you
can
get
from
them
as
a
whole
it
is
drinkable
even
if
its
one
i
wouldnt
have
again
probably
the
most
drinkable
sour
beer
i
have
ever
had
with
all
that
balance
supporting
the
sourness
pours
a
deep
red
good
retention
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
but
you
can
smell
the
sour
vinagar
fruits
and
grapes
light
body
with
awesome
funk
taste
from
the
fruits
vinagar
malts
and
sugars
so
easily
drinkable
its
a
bit
scary
drinks
quite
nicely
the
balance
is
their
to
keep
the
sour
in
check
and
allows
this
to
go
down
well
really
a
nice
beer
overall
more
fruity
and
less
nearly
as
sour
as
i
expected
it
to
be
this
one
pours
a
burnt
amber
in
color
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
it
smells
pretty
good
it
smells
extremely
sour
in
a
way
that
makes
you
want
to
resmell
to
see
if
you
got
the
first
one
right
the
taste
is
oaky
sweet
and
has
the
great
sour
flavor
to
finish
off
the
taste
and
its
left
in
the
after
taste
i
really
like
this
one
although
it
can
be
overpoweringly
sweet
and
eventually
gives
off
a
vinegar
flavor
that
is
kind
of
repulsive
its
almost
mouthwateringly
sour
this
beer
was
really
good
the
first
time
i
tried
but
after
a
couple
times
its
losing
its
luster
the
only
knock
is
that
it
could
be
a
little
too
sweet
it
drinks
pretty
well
but
one
is
enough
well
it
was
certainly
drinkable
and
not
bad
by
any
means
but
it
drank
more
like
a
cider
with
its
fruitiness
and
lack
of
much
malt
or
hop
character
i
like
their
intentions
with
the
sweet
and
sour
balance
but
i
could
have
used
less
sweet
and
more
sour
d
this
will
be
dangerous
on
tap
in
the
basement
i
could
drink
this
all
night
if
i
didnt
have
to
drive
aka
didnt
feel
guilty
of
emptying
the
keg
very
drinkable
in
that
it
balances
the
best
of
sour
and
sweet
without
any
of
the
worst
of
sour
or
sweet
nothing
cloying
here
this
would
be
great
with
some
cheese
camembertbrie
cabots
habanero
overall
tasty
good
introductory
sour
clear
crimson
brown
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
very
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
large
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
is
acidic
and
slightly
sour
some
oak
as
well
the
label
states
mildly
sour
and
that
is
what
you
get
flavor
has
hints
of
cherries
and
a
slight
vinous
quality
mild
acidity
maybe
the
slightest
hint
of
funkiness
but
this
is
a
much
cleaner
example
of
a
flanders
ale
light
to
medium
body
with
carbonation
that
is
slightly
effervescent
the
combination
works
well
in
sour
ales
a
milder
and
cleaner
example
that
still
has
good
flavor
quite
refreshing
this
seemed
a
little
younger
and
fresher
than
what
im
accustomed
to
for
the
style
or
perhaps
ive
just
gotten
used
to
drinking
old
beer
bright
well
moderated
lactic
tartness
redolent
of
sour
cherry
and
some
oaky
tannic
notes
finish
was
nicely
dry
and
clean
with
some
citric
sweetness
at
the
very
end
d
while
not
mindblowing
this
would
be
a
great
intro
beer
for
those
looking
to
try
a
sour
but
want
to
keep
the
pucker
and
the
balance
in
check

a
purchase
or
ten

from
a
bottle

snifter
dark

color
with
about
an
inch
of
foam
smells
very
murky
somewhat
metallic
with
a
flowery
scent
as
well
tastes
like
toffee
with
this
sweet
and
sourness
to
it
that
is
very
hard
to
describe
except
by
describing
how
tasty
it
is
not
too
sour
whereas
some
sours
make
my
mouth
cringe
up
but
not
too
sweet
as
with
a
faro
very
drinkable
i
have
had
it
on
draft
as
well
and
could
not
stop
having
this
except
for
the
price
tag
bottles
are
a
very
good
price
though
and
i
high
encourage
anyone
to
try
this

makes
a
great
brew
for
a

session

i
would
like
to
definitely
try
this
again
monks
cafe
flemish
sour
is
a
mighty
easydrinking
beer
the
sourness
isnt
over
the
top
makes
for
a
mellow
lowkey
drinking
experience
an
anyday
sour
if
you
will
just
really
enjoyable
all
around
d
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
after
eating
a
heavy
meal
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
makes
you
wonder
why
its
gone
so
fast
i
picked
up
this
beer
on
a
whi
as
i
had
never
heard
of
the
style
and
was
blown
away
this
was
a
really
goos
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
others
within
the
style
d
im
not
exactly
used
to
sour
beers
but
it
didnt
keep
me
from
enjoying
this
notes
personally
i
love
vinegar
so
im
very
cool
with
sours
like
this
refreshing
especially
after
having
a
big
stout
in
the
taste
the
sour
comes
out
boldly
buoyed
by
the
sweetness
of
the
young
blend
the
interplay
is
well
done
creating
a
beverage
that
is
tart
but
very
drinkable
i
certainly
enjoyed
this
though
it
was
a
bit
vinegary
d
very
very
drinkable
intense
tart
flavor
on
this
one
left
my
lips
smacking
this
would
go
great
with
a
meal
smooth
and
nicely
flavored
it
has
that
taste
of
a
purple
sweettart
it
is
not
as
complex
or
potent
as
russian
river
consecration
but
it
makes
a
great
introduction
to
sour
beer
taste
is
also
quite
tart
and
vinegary
very
sharp
and
a
bit
unpleasant
its
got
a
fairly
sharp
mouthfeel
due
to
harsh
carb
d
extremely
disappointed
by
this
one
the
syrupy
fruit
flavors
are
almost
medicinal
and
not
pleasant
i
love
all
styles
of
mouth
puckering
beers
but
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
tastes
like
an
accidentally
soured
beer
pours
a
garnet
to
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
beige
head
somewhat
hazy
look
smell
is
vinegar
and
sour
funk
followed
by
tart
raspberries
or
cherries
taste
is
a
slight
sour
vinegar
taste
that
is
infused
with
some
tart
fruit
taste
which
works
well
mouth
feell
is
medium
with
carbonation
it
has
a
tartness
to
it
with
vinegar
and
sour
notes
i
liked
this
one
i
thought
it
was
balanced
well
and
a
tasty
sour
flanders
good
one
burgundy
and
clear
with
a
good
head
on
pour
but
fades
fast
can
smell
the
funk
easily
nice
sour
scent
making
me
think
cherries
are
included
taste
is
light
slightly
sweet
in
the
finish
and
has
enough
sourness
to
be
enjoyable
but
not
overpowering
high
level
of
carbonation
and
a
thin
body
slight
copper
in
aftertaste
makes
me
think
this
is
the
old
beer
part
of
the
blend
overall
an
enjoyable
experience
but
not
one
to
repeat
at
4
for
11
oz
kind
lame
fake
fruit
tasting
not
buying
again
delicious
and
easy
to
swig
considering
the
tartness
i
believe
this
would
be
an
appropriate
diving
board
for
someone
who
has
never
tried
a
sour
it
is
decently
mild
and
less
aggressive
on
the
vinegar
o
i
was
instantly
impressed
with
this
one
and
later
found
out
it
is
the
same
brewer
as
gulden
draak
my
favorite
beer
i
guess
i
shouldnt
have
been
surprised
but
i
definitely
was
d
i
find
this
to
be
a
bit
overly
drinkable
a
bit
too
smooth
and
tasty
the
alcohol
is
barely
present
at
all
and
is
a
delicious
sour
brew
my
girlfriend
doesnt
normally
venture
outside
of
the
hefewitblonde
arena
but
she
loved
this
one
claiming
it
was
one
of
the
best
beers
shes
ever
had
i
am
trying
to
get
her
into
belgian
beer
and
this
was
a
great
one
for
her
to
try
hey
this
is
probably
a
excellent
example
of
this
type
of
beer
honestly
its
just
not
my
thing
d
this
is
a
nice
oud
bruin
the
sourness
was
actually
quite
refreshing
hopefully
ill
get
to
revisit
this
one
nonetheless
friggin
tasty
seriously
this
was
a
great
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
flanders
and
flemish
ales
and
this
one
is
right
up
there
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
light
fizzy
head
aromas
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
and
cherry
are
huge
on
the
nose
the
palate
has
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
more
so
than
other
beers
like
it
but
tons
of
red
fruit
flavor
with
a
nice
sour
that
isnt
over
the
top
a
good
introduction
into
these
style
of
beers
bartender
d
not
terrible
but
i
would
definitly
not
want
more
then
one
of
these
a
night
overall
not
bad
but
just
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
taste
perhaps
i
am
too
used
to
nw
style
sour
reds
because
these
flemish
belgians
seem
to
candysweet
disclaimer
only
a
few
beers
under
my
belt
in
this
style
so
interpret
with
caution
this
is
a
good
substitute
for
the
enigma
i
have
been
drinking
and
ran
out
of
all
in
all
a
really
good
beer
from
the
bottle
the
beer
a
medium
reddish
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
is
more
carbonated
than
ive
had
on
tap
this
keeps
feeding
the
head
making
it
fluffy
as
well
as
accentuate
the
fruity
and
acidic
aromas
also
in
the
smell
is
a
medicinal
plasticy
phenol
aroma
that
was
somewhat
unpleasant
the
ale
has
cherry
flavors
and
acidity
not
unlike
a
kriek
with
a
light
spritzy
body
and
active
carbonation
it
was
very
refreshing
almost
like
a
soft
drink
while
delicious
on
its
own
monks
café
will
pair
well
with
a
wide
variety
of
different
foods
especially
ones
that
share
the
same
funky
barnyardy
flavors
try
pairing
it
with
a
gamey
meat
such
as
duck
with
a
sweet
sauce
or
a
rich
pork
dish
it
would
certainly
compliment
an
earthy
mushroomy
cheese
like
brie
de
meaux
or
forsterkäse
which
is
wrapped
in
bark
for
an
extra
heady
flavor
experiment
too
this
beer
is
fun
and
delightful
with
chocolate
d
unique
flavor
and
aroma
im
not
sure
if
the
body
is
the
way
it
should
be
a
good
doorway
into
sours
and
one
i
will
continue
to
explore
d
thought
this
was
a
a
pretty
good
flanders
my
girlfriend
loves
this
beer
i
enjoyed
the
sour
cherries
in
the
smell
and
taste
and
wish
it
was
a
little
less
carbonated
but
definitely
a
good
beer
will
definitely
be
getting
more
of
this
for
my
girlfirend
and
will
definitely
have
some
as
well
mf
really
a
pretty
crisp
sensation
medium
bodied
very
grippy
good
balance
of
sweet
and
sour
highly
recommended
would
definitely
drink
again
this
was
one
of
the
first
sours
i
ever
tried
years
ago
and
the
delicious
qualities
are
still
ringing
true
to
this
day
d
overall
very
big
let
down
this
stuff
is
not
good
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
to
represent
this
style
it
will
be
a
struggle
to
finish
this
bottle
d
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
because
it
has
wellbalanced
flavors
and
neither
the
sweetness
nor
sourness
is
overpowering
since
i
generally
dont
like
slamming
a
beer
ill
point
out
as
a
postscript
that
this
brewery
does
make
good
beer
for
example
augustijn
ale
which
i
gave
a
solid
a
including
a
4
5
score
for
taste
in
my
review
of
it
i
hated
monks
cafe
however
overall
to
much
vinegar
not
to
much
else
going
on
i
would
buy
this
again
for
a
very
interesting
change
of
pace
i
would
like
my
son
to
try
it
he
use
to
like
all
that
horrible
sour
candy
still
does
this
is
the
adult
version
overall
this
is
a
sour
i
can
buy
by
the
four
pack
and
enjoy
on
a
regular
basis
i
think
it
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
without
being
a
homerun
d
a
very
pleasing
and
drinkable
brew
a
nice
summer
refresher
not
too
sour
especially
for
style
which
could
be
a
good
or
bad
thing
depending
upon
your
druthers
redneck
rating
its
alright
drinkability
not
my
favorite
flanders
red
but
solid
d
very
refreshing
and
i
find
myself
imbibing
faster
then
usual
my
first
try
for
this
style
and
i
am
very
pleased
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
my
first
foray
into
the
flemish
sour
red
ale
genre
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
the
beer
store
employee
said
it
tasted
like
sour
patch
kids
which
didnt
exactly
get
me
pumped
up
fortunately
i
wouldnt
say
that
was
too
accurate
of
a
characterization
it
poured
an
almost
blood
red
color
with
a
think
head
that
fizzled
away
pretty
quickly
but
never
totally
disappears
it
smells
interesting
a
little
bit
lactic
perhaps
but
not
necessarily
bad
the
taste
is
a
little
sour
go
figure
but
i
liked
it
the
mouthfeel
is
almost
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
during
the
first
sip
or
two
the
bubbles
actually
grazed
my
nose
like
when
drinking
a
coke
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
but
i
think
that
goes
with
the
category
certainly
good
for
one
probably
not
more
than
that
though
would
go
really
well
with
bread
and
cheese
overall
was
a
pleasant
surprise
d
super
duper
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
its
not
overly
sour
has
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
makes
it
much
more
drinkable
than
the
average
sour
especially
for
those
not
familiar
w
the
style
for
that
reason
i
think
itd
be
a
great
intro
to
the
style
was
mine
way
back
when
and
if
you
can
find
it
usually
not
a
bad
price
tag
either
from
a
bottle
it
appears
an
amber
color
with
a
yellowish
tan
head
that
doesnt
retain
well
faint
amount
of
lace
clings
to
the
glass
aroma
is
an
interesting
mixture
of
berry
and
vinegar
the
fruity
berry
in
the
aroma
comes
across
a
bit
like
cherries
taste
is
sweet
upfront
with
the
cherry
flavor
that
turns
a
bit
acidic
with
a
note
of
sourness
ligh
feel
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
there
is
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
fruity
sourness
that
is
mildly
drying
on
the
tongue
this
has
more
sweetness
than
i
was
expecting
but
perks
my
interest
in
trying
more
flemish
examples
as
it
warms
the
vinegar
character
becomes
more
evident
seemingly
like
apple
cidar
vinegar
overall
very
impressed
by
this
its
not
terribly
expensive
but
is
a
fantastic
drink
and
has
a
good
amount
of
sour
punch
while
still
being
delightfully
sweet
d
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
the
tartness
does
not
overpower
and
dull
the
palate
and
the
sweetness
is
not
too
cloying
well
done
another
one
of
those
you
have
many
times
and
realize
youve
yet
to
review
it
or
maybe
im
the
only
one
this
guy
pours
a
clear
dark
rubybrown
topped
by
a
steadfast
head
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
vinegar
tart
lemon
figs
white
grapes
wet
grass
and
black
pepper
the
taste
holds
notes
of
red
grapes
sour
raspberries
candi
sugar
and
a
touch
of
honey
bringing
up
the
rear
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
decent
brew
but
a
little
too
timid
for
what
it
is
something
like
that
picked
this
up
at
friar
tucks
special
thanks
go
out
to
yeahnatenelson
for
the
parking
lot
info
the
straight
truck
fit
rather
easily
on
to
the
beer
the
smell
is
a
bit
sour
and
biscuity
very
dry
and
highly
carbonated
sour
taste
and
cherry
darkness
dry
finish
leaves
me
wanting
more
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
but
still
glad
i
grabbed
this
one
db
i
bought
this
because
it
was
the
cheapest
belgian
single
on
the
entire
shelf
of
a
local
store
turned
out
to
be
a
great
buy
successfully
blending
wine
flavors
with
a
great
malt
and
yeast
backbone
i
would
be
proud
to
have
this
brewed
for
my
restaurant
probably
a
one
or
two
bottle
thing
but
still
one
of
the
most
drinkable
sours
i
have
come
across
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
thats
worth
trying
probably
wouldnt
have
more
than
2
in
a
row
though
drinkability
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
okay
instead
of
a
sour
finish
what
is
present
is
a
general
tanginess
and
an
unpleasant
metallic
taste
also
the
carbonation
could
stand
to
be
pulled
back
slightly
doubt
ill
try
again
but
still
a
noble
offering
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
on
the
mark
light
relatively
thin
and
bubbly
an
acceptable
example
of
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
flanders
d
not
very
drinkable
to
me
im
new
to
the
style
and
i
must
say
im
not
digging
it
much
i
just
wanted
to
finish
my
sample
and
be
done
with
it
to
be
frank
not
bad
but
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
id
try
another
sour
for
sure
but
not
anytime
soon
my
first
sour
to
be
honest
i
dont
like
it
later
on
down
the
road
i
will
probably
grow
to
appreciate
the
flavors
but
it
will
definitely
always
be
low
on
my
list
of
beer
styles
d
did
i
mention
i
love
flemish
sours
i
think
ill
have
another
d
i
could
definitely
drink
a
number
of
these
in
a
sitting
especially
forwith
dessert
this
was
a
great
introduction
to
sour
ales
for
me
d
this
is
my
first
exposure
to
the
style
and
i
am
greatly
pleased
i
wish
i
could
find
this
locally
so
i
could
start
experimenting
with
food
pairings
very
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
a
sugary
treat
d
drank
3
bottles
in
one
sitting
great
balance
and
light
carbonation
make
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
plus
the
fact
that
it
only
runs
about
2
50
a
bottle
and
is
easy
to
find
at
bevmo
deep
ruby
red
frothy
offwhite
head
that
recedes
fairly
quickly
tart
at
first
dies
quickly
and
then
a
huge
sour
cherry
flavor
emerges
through
nearly
perfect
mouthfeel
my
first
sour
seems
like
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
a
very
nice
interesting
brew
d
its
a
nice
brew
not
nearly
as
sour
as
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
which
i
prefer
this
good
tasting
ale
could
be
a
nice
way
to
ease
people
into
sours
without
clobbering
them
over
the
head
too
sweet
though
lots
of
carbonation
as
expected
it
gives
it
a
champagne
like
mouthfeel
it
certainly
tastes
like
it
smells
cherries
mixed
with
some
dark
fruit
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
tart
that
finishes
very
dry
i
havent
tried
many
sours
but
this
beer
seems
like
a
great
place
to
start
drinkability
is
large
could
easily
zip
through
a
few
of
these
wout
any
burnout
this
is
one
that
would
pair
as
well
with
a
medium
rare
fillet
as
it
would
with
a
fruittopped
cheesecake
or
cherry
tart
would
drink
again
but
should
be
paired
with
food
something
to
counter
act
the
sourness

this
is
my
session

excellent
brew
i
know
this
beer
gets
a
lot
of
abuse
but
i
think
it
is
a
good
beer
while
it
might
not
be
top
of
the
line
it
is
a
wonderful
beer
to
keep
on

also

heavily
carbonated

big
taste
is

with
a
little

some
cherries
very
nice
carbonation
and
clean
to
drink
very
refreshing
on
this
hot
summer
day
drinkabilty
is
above
average
probably
in
part
to
the
light
body
and
style
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
night
with
ease
drinkability
pretty
good
i
thought
it
was
very
interesting
i
would
drink
it
again
im
just
beginning
to
dive
into
the
world
of
sours
it
really
is
great
trip
and
i
enjoyed
this
easily
accessible
one
the
more
pronounced
tartness
and
less
residual
sweetness
of
this
example
i
prefer
over
some
of
the
sweeter
finishing
ones
a
pretty
good
beer
after
a
couple
of
sips
it
grows
on
you
a
bit
pours
a
darker
than
expected
reddish
brown
color
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
of
sour
fruit
and
a
slight
funkiness
nose
has
some
cherry
in
it
as
well
i
would
say
this
has
medium
sourness
to
it
compared
to
some
other
sour
beers
acidic
as
well
this
ia
not
an
extreme
version
of
the
style
but
is
very
good
well
balanced
and
at
a
great
price
to
boot
reevaluation
on
71012
better
than
i
originally
remembered
more
tartness
deeper
fruit
notes
better
balance
really
nice
d
exceptionally
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
would
take
this
over
any
session
beer
any
day
d
i
love
this
stuff
i
could
seriously
drink
this
stuff
all
night
long
when
im
at
the
gingerman
i
love
the
taste
to
me
its
one
of
the
most
easy
drinking
sours
out
there
worth
getting
to
try
if
you
see
it
overall
a
very
nice
beer
worth
seeking
out
a
nice
beer
i
will
probably
pick
up
another
one
of
these
and
see
how
i
feel
about
it
at
a
later
date
very
drinkable
sour
ale
tasty
d
drinkablility
suffers
a
bit
due
to
the
sweetness
and
vinegar
characteristics
it
wasnt
a
struggle
to
take
down
but
i
wasnt
disappointed
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
glass
d
really
like
the
sour
notes
of
this
beer
but
the
sweetness
really
hurts
the
ability
of
the
beer
to
be
more
drinkable
d
i
feel
that
this
is
a
great
brew
for
the
price
however
i
would
like
a
bit
more
complexity
the
sweetness
is
really
very
overwhelming
like
i
said
i
adore
duchesse
and
this
is
a
decent
albeit
cheaper
in
taste
and
substitute
for
it
when
i
dont
feel
like
shelling
out
for
the
goods
definitely
worth
a
try
on
draft
its
good
too
not
much
different
from
the
bottle
no
need
to
buy
a
case
though
unless
you
reeeeally
love
it
or
you
want
to
share
it
with
friends
d
interesting
and
a
bit
different
from
what
im
used
to
light
and
pretty
refreshing
goes
better
with
some
light
snacks
cheeses
than
it
does
drinking
by
itself
the
flavors
complement
the
food
where
drinking
on
its
own
is
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
sour
vinegar
aroma
but
not
in
an
unpleasant
way
taste
is
as
id
expect
from
the
aroma
quite
tart
and
sour
a
little
bit
fruity
very
sharp
but
enjoyable
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
but
a
nice
change
from
the
norm
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
much
better
than
i
recall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
my
only
caveat
is
that
is
a
little
too
moderate
of
palette
despite
the
complexity
i
think
it
is
pleasant
and
immensely
enjoyable
and
perhaps
not
as
challenging
as
i
would
like
d
incredibly
drinkable
for
a
sour
but
almost
to
negative
results
the
grape
notes
overwhelm
the
vinegar
flavors
for
a
very
mellow
and
clean
finish
d
nice
i
could
finish
off
a
bottle
but
not
sure
how
many
afterwards
this
is
a
sipper
anyway
and
not
an
everyday
beer
at
that
but
it
was
a
great
treat
to
try
consumed
040810
overall
impression
this
is
a
very
interesting
style
one
that
reminds
me
of
really
good
cider
if
you
like
slightly
tart
flavors
or
apples
youll
love
this
beer
and
its
ok
in
drinkablilty
decent
stab
at
the
style
for
a
good
price
per
bottle
d
one
could
probably
enjoy
quite
a
few
of
these
very
easily
not
too
strong
by
any
means
pours
out
gorgeously
into
my
chimay
goblet
bright
ruby
body
with
vivacious
carbonation
and
strong
frothy
off
white
head
smell
is
sweetly
phenolic
with
a
twang
of
funkiness
some
darker
balancing
notes
of
oak
vanilla
and
roasted
grain
provide
a
nice
backbone
taste
has
great
depth
sweet
tangy
tart
funky
and
sour
the
sweetness
comes
of
lambic
in
nature
cherries
and
raspberries
sweeping
waves
of
funk
tangy
bits
of
citrus
rind
sour
waves
of
bitter
seeds
and
sweet
candied
cherries
just
a
plethora
of
great
flavors
finishes
with
a
lingering
melding
of
flavors
and
touch
of
graininess
in
the
end
to
level
things
out
this
beer
was
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
like
today
i
would
go
as
far
to
say
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
very
enjoyable
overall
d
very
easy
to
drink
almost
finished
it
while
thinking
about
the
taste
very
good
for
around
3
md
excellent
light
on
the
tongue
thirst
quenching
not
heavy
on
the
sour
and
the
funk
at
all
this
is
as
close
as
it
gets
to
a
everyday
sour
ale
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
tried
it
on
tap
at
b
j
s
temecula
pours
a
garnetruby
red
color
with
a
bit
of
tan
lacing
on
top
smells
of
red
wine
vinegar
tart
cherries
and
lactic
acid
flavors
not
much
different
although
i
detect
a
bit
of
sweetness
which
plays
nicely
off
of
the
sour
funk
crisp
and
refreshing
though
i
doubt
i
could
drink
more
than
one
another
i
would
buy
for
any
occasion
drinkability
immensely
drinkable
reminded
me
of
a
winebeer
hybrid
would
reach
for
many
more
tastes
like
candy
and
goes
down
like
it
too
looks
nice
smells
pretty
fine
too
with
some
fruity
notes
but
there
is
way
to
much
sweetness
for
what
i
wanted
the
medicinal
sweetness
all
but
masks
the
characteristics
that
could
be
present
like
cherry
nyquil
wanted
a
dry
puckering
finish
but
this
leaves
with
just
a
wisp
of
tartness
and
lets
you
keep
the
residual
sweetness
to
stick
in
your
mouth
the
12oz
bottle
in
my
snifter
is
more
then
enough
for
me
but
i
am
still
glad
i
tried
it
for
more
oud
bruin
experience
for
only
2
99
interesting
but
a
little
too
sweet
not
as
much
depth
as
in
some
other
sours
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
smooth
and
creamy
going
down
rather
bitter
sour
finish
with
a
lightly
sweet
end
finish
the
drinkability
isnt
high
on
this
one
i
really
would
not
want
more
than
one
in
a
day
maybe
once
they
grow
on
me
more
but
right
now
every
sip
is
a
little
shocker
probably
the
hardest
beer
ive
drank
down
in
a
while
not
because
its
not
good
because
this
beer
is
just
so
different
i
think
im
still
not
sure
what
to
think
usually
they
go
real
quick
but
this
one
ive
been
sipping
and
still
have
half
the
12
oz
bottle
left
worth
a
try
it
is
certainly
different
d
this
is
a
terrific
beer
that
i
purchased
on
a
whim
i
will
definitely
be
purchasing
more
of
these
an
enjoyable
flemish
sour
ale
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
sips
the
sour
funk
is
only
slightly
negative
on
my
palate
i
would
appreciate
a
slightly
cleaner
taste
drinkability
slow
sipping
beer
bomber
bottle
is
more
than
enough
for
a
session
wonderfully
drinkable
the
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
here
is
spoton
and
the
low
alcohol
level
lends
itself
to
sessionability
this
is
one
beer
that
i
honestly
believe
i
could
drink
all
night
long
without
tiring
of
it
very
nice
d
my
palate
can
only
handle
a
small
amount
of
sweet
beers
this
one
is
very
well
done
and
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
beige
head
the
aroma
is
tart
apple
and
tart
grapes
the
taste
is
caramel
malt
as
well
as
tart
apples
and
grapes
the
apple
is
dominant
lowmedium
carbonation
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
a
pretty
nice
sour
beer
that
is
a
not
as
sour
as
some
but
has
a
nice
fruity
flavor
verdict
brimming
with
character
and
depth
monks
café
is
a
terrific
beer
that
really
satisfies
when
im
craving
a
sweet
and
sour
beer
if
youve
never
had
a
sour
and
youre
looking
for
a
safe
start
or
if
youre
just
looking
for
something
a
little
different
this
would
be
a
great
choice
substantial
body
with
a
smooth
creamy
feel
a
sweet
fruity
and
creamy
beer
makes
it
a
good
dessert
option
n
b
i
feel
like
someone
blended
beer
with
a
prune
flavored
izze
and
it
actually
turned
out
well
that
is
a
major
understatement
but
thats
what
i
thought
of
when
i
first
tried
this
beer
as
far
as
drinkability
thats
a
tought
one
its
a
very
tasty
beer
very
smooth
and
flavorful
the
only
drawback
is
the
sweetness
might
become
a
little
too
much
after
more
then
one
bottle
thats
not
to
say
its
not
a
really
good
beer
because
it
is
appearance
is
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
thick
head
and
fair
lace
smell
of
young
sour
wine
thats
mild
with
a
sweet
green
apple
note
taste
has
a
nice
balance
with
the
sweet
and
sour
thats
dry
at
the
end
mouthfeel
has
a
medium
feel
with
good
body
and
carbonation
actually
better
than
what
i
expected
for
my
first
sour
ale
smell
is
of
new
red
wine
slightly
vinous
acidic
and
oaky
taste
brings
the
winelike
flavors
with
a
big
hit
of
balsamic
vinegar
and
adds
just
a
hint
of
tart
cherry
and
sticky
sweetness
medium
bodied
slightly
chewy
and
sticky
palate
coating
but
without
a
big
aftertaste
decent
beer
a
little
lighter
than
expected
possibly
could
use
a
little
more
aging
on
it
d
highly
drinkable
quite
unique
and
refreshing
id
like
to
try
brewing
it
myself
as
it
is
a
hitormiss
affair
trying
to
find
it
d
its
a
new
style
to
me
maybe
my
first
true
commericially
brewed
sour
and
it
seemed
good
for
the
style
when
i
checked
out
the
guidlines
its
not
a
thirst
quencher
or
a
chugger
by
any
means
but
im
sure
thats
not
its
purpose
i
think
its
sour
nature
is
something
to
appreciate
its
definitely
sparked
my
interest
in
the
style
serving
type
11
2oz
bottle
55
degrees
snifter
beer
first
is
pretty
thin
not
watery
just
no
body
its
starts
out
sweet
but
the
sweetness
gives
way
to
a
strong
and
dominant
balsamic
vinegar
taste
the
finish
is
tart
there
is
also
an
odd
woodsey
aftertaste
that
degrades
my
pleasure
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
has
not
been
my
favorite
flanders
i
can
certainly
see
the
appeal
to
this
beer
as
its
really
unlike
most
anything
ive
had
it
doesnt
have
any
of
the
hop
profile
that
you
get
from
ipas
or
any
of
the
roasted
maltiness
from
a
solid
stout
i
dont
know
that
i
want
to
drink
sours
all
night
but
i
think
i
like
this
one
pours
a
clear
russet
with
a
loosely
bubbled
twofinger
head
a
little
lacing
the
smell
is
toffee
marigold
niagara
grapes
and
hints
of
graphite
the
taste
is
big
on
the
brown
sugar
and
toffee
with
some
grapeskin
tang
and
just
a
hint
of
funk
and
bitterness
the
sweetness
dominates
it
isnt
much
a
sour
ale
its
a
little
syrupy
highly
carbonated
a
very
dense
beer
easy
to
drink
wish
i
had
another
as
oud
bruins
go
its
nothing
on
goudenband
but
makes
for
a
simpler
alternative
drinkability
i
think
this
beer
is
just
a
hair
too
sweet
to
be
exceptionally
drinkable
still
the
tartness
is
just
enough
to
keep
me
interested
and
i
feel
like
i
would
gladly
include
one
of
these
in
my
daily
diet
the
taste
is
definitely
sour
i
get
a
hint
of
green
apple
in
it
i
wouldnt
call
it
drinkable
though
even
though
i
am
enjoying
it
i
am
not
sure
i
could
have
another
tonight
and
it
isnt
for
everyone
note
it
went
very
well
with
tomatobased
shrimp
pasta
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
my
expectations
were
not
that
high
for
it
but
it
not
only
met
them
but
exceeded
them
a
very
nice
sipper
i
am
definitely
savoring
it
it
isnt
as
sour
as
i
would
like
but
i
still
think
it
is
good
pours
a
nice
deep
syrupy
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
moderate
sandy
head
composed
of
larger
bubbles
that
rapidly
fades
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
some
lacing
smell
is
apple
vinous
slight
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
vinegar
to
it
too
taste
is
somewhat
fleeting
at
first
sip
burst
of
flavor
that
ebbs
quickly
lets
try
again
tart
apples
with
some
sweetness
to
it
a
bit
of
lightly
toasted
malt
in
the
finish
some
sourness
to
it
though
quite
balanced
with
the
other
flavors
some
spice
in
there
too
though
not
exactly
sure
what
it
is
a
very
slight
hint
of
must
too
this
is
quite
goodmy
first
flanders
but
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
for
sure
i
can
see
myself
craving
something
like
this
and
things
far
more
extreme
in
the
future
light
and
a
bit
prickly
this
one
is
actually
quite
refreshing
now
leaving
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
apples
quite
drinkable
i
am
definitely
impressed
with
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
a
bit
harsh
to
begin
with
but
theres
a
litttle
bit
of
creaminess
that
comes
in
at
last
minute
d
this
one
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
had
no
problem
drinking
all
12oz
of
this
bad
boy
and
at
a
alarming
rate
the
only
set
back
to
this
one
i
would
have
to
say
is
i
could
feel
this
making
a
mess
of
your
gut
if
too
much
was
drank
would
recommend
this
one
as
a
sour
to
start
off
with
i
think
this
is
an
interesting
enough
beer
and
probably
a
good
to
share
with
a
wine
lover
but
i
was
somewhat
let
down
by
this
beer
i
simply
cant
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
and
still
enjoying
itand
i
like
sour
belgians
this
is
a
decent
but
not
excellent
example
of
the
style
rather
drinkable
would
pair
wonderfully
with
hard
cheeses
a
great
beer
for
someone
who
may
think
heshe
is
too
good
for
beer
d
i
enjoy
this
one
but
after
12oz
i
am
ready
to
move
on
to
something
else
the
sweetsour
thing
tires
me
a
little
however
i
will
come
back
to
this
one
another
night
so
it
is
at
least
above
average
i
have
never
really
been
a
fan
for
sour
ales
but
the
belgians
make
some
very
good
sour
ales
this
is
a
very
good
sour
ale
monks
cafe
flemish
sour
ale
is
another
amazing
ale
to
add
to
your
repertoire
of
unique
and
strange
beers
tart
sour
and
sweet
this
ale
is
drinkable
but
isnt
for
everyone
nice
head
some
lacing
and
is
a
decent
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
it
had
this
at
the
dive
bar
on
75th
street
on
the
upper
west
side
of
manhattan
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
amazing
red
color
i
only
had
a
small
glass
of
it
but
i
think
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
the
only
problem
is
that
its
a
little
sweet
great
sour
aroma
good
carbonation
again
amazing
color
a
little
more
sour
and
a
little
less
sweet
and
it
would
be
perfect
d
high
its
very
tasty
but
a
tinge
less
carbonation
and
a
less
estery
profile
would
substantially
improve
the
drinkability
although
it
might
make
this
brew
less
interesting
drinkability
is
pretty
good
this
has
held
up
well
maybe
improved
a
bit
after
a
year
in
the
cellar
i
think
the
acidity
has
increased
and
while
its
still
to
sweet
and
cider
vinegary
for
my
taste
in
the
style
i
think
the
age
has
helped
it
as
i
dont
recall
being
to
pleased
with
the
first
bottle
when
i
bought
it
and
ultimately
busted
out
a
little
later
in
that
night
then
i
should
have
so
who
knows
poured
out
a
redish
brown
color
with
a
nice
little
head
on
it
smelled
strongly
of
tart
cherries
and
a
hint
of
balsamic
vinegar
definitely
a
tart
cherry
taste
followed
by
a
sweet
malt
to
finish
it
off
kind
of
like
a
sour
cherry
candy
mouth
feels
smooth
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
dryness
on
the
end
of
it
i
could
only
have
one
maybe
two
of
these
and
then
get
sick
of
it
my
first
foray
as
far
as
i
know
into
sours
and
it
wasnt
bad
but
not
great
either

elmers
that
i
get
from
la

a
little

in
the
smell
also
not
bad
mildly
sour
but
also
a
little
one
dimensional
id
take
a
rodenbach
or

over
this
any
day
mouthfeel
is
a
mediumlight
that
has
an
airy
amount
of
carbonation
that
finishes
dry
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
this
is
only
the
second
sour
ive
ever
had
and
im
liking
the
general
style
more
and
more
glad
i
can
easily
pick
this
up
overall
a
decent
representation
of
its
style
if
i
could
change
it
id
wish
it
a
bit
more
sour
this
oud
bruin
pours
a
crystal
clear
red
ale
with
an
off
white
head
that
fluffs
up
upon
the
pour
and
stays
there
the
aroma
is
vinegary
sour
and
sweet
not
much
fruit
in
the
nose
but
i
am
sure
it
will
come
through
in
the
flavor
a
sip
provides
and
acid
bite
with
the
flavor
of
sour
cherry
cough
drops
a
slight
funk
in
there
as
well
light
bodied
and
effervescent
for
sure
were
it
not
for
the
price
i
would
session
this
beer
every
day
possible
d
tough
for
me
rank
higher
on
drinkability
because
of
the
sweetness
if
more
balanced
or
a
drier
finish
it
would
be
a
very
good
beer

this

very
refreshing

drinkable
good
price
point
as
well
d
this
was
the
first
sour
i
ever
tried
due
to
the
accessible
price
point
almost
two
years
ago
and
i
really
didnt
care
for
it
i
couldnt
believe
why
anyone
would
buy
this
today
i
can
truly
attest
to
how
my
my
palate
has
evolvedchanged
im
really
enjoying
this
wonderful
beer
at
3
this
is
an
amazing
beer
that
im
likely
to
keep
in
rotation
as
an
everyday
sourdesert
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
be
buying
it
often
i
can
see
drinks
pretty
smoothly
considering
the
sour
flavor
pours
a
medium
brown
with
plenty
of
head
the
head
causes
very
thick
lacing
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
as
it
settles
down
into
the
beer
very
acrid
smell
that
reminds
me
of
malt
vinegar
very
very
acidic
smell
that
also
gives
way
to
more
of
an
apple
scent
the
taste
is
slightly
less
sour
than
duchesse
but
still
great
and
extremely
drinkable
overall
not
impressed
at
all
like
a
cheap
version
of
duchess
a
little
thin
and
too
vinegary
for
me
but
an
example
of
the
style
every
fan
should
try
i
do
not
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
with
sours
but
if
they
are
all
like
this
i
am
looking
forward
to
more
of
them

more

tartness
would
be
welcome
d
a
sweeter
take
on
a
sour
ale
for
me
this
is
better
in
small
doses
it
gets
rather
cloying
and
begins
to
be

much
after
about
half

picked
up
a

at

in

poured
into

glass
dark
ruby
red
color
great
looking
tan
head
that
lasted
for
some
time
ample
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
reminded
me
a
lot
of
that
funky
aroma
of
a
lambic
taste
was
good
but
quite
unusual
on
one
hand
it
was
tart
like
any
great
belgian
sour
ale
but
it
also
had
a
very
different
sugar
flavor
profile
it
was
a
lot
like
the
lactose
sweetness
in
a
milk
stout
i
am
not
sure
if
i
was
really
in
love
with
this
combination
yes
i
will
admit
that
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
i
applaud
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
if
it
lived
up
to
what
i
was
expecting
which
was
something
more
along
the
lines
of
the
classic
style
of
a
sour
red
ale
d
not
sure
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
much
of
this
but
easy
going
down
pours
a
nut
brown
colored

clear
with
a
small
offwhite
color
head
quickly
diminishing
sour
fruity
aroma
very
sour
almost
like
a
cheesy
sour
but
not
quite
some
light
fruit
like
apple
or
light
colored
grape
strong
sour
taste
that
same
fruitiness
in
the
taste
and
the
aftertaste
similar
to
apple
or
cherry
or
something
not
bad
tasting
not
very
offputting
but
it
does
take
a
little
getting
used
to
drinking
makes
me
thirsty
for
more
which
is
the
sign
of
a
good
beer
right
almost
like
a
nutty
taste
to
it
some
substance
weaker
less
flavor
as
it
warms

monks
cafe
was
named
one
of
the
top
10
places
to
have
a
beer
before
you
die
by
all
about
beer
magazine
drink
its
good
and
ive
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
over
the
past
couple
weeks
always
enjoyable
but
not
one
i
could
pound
during
a
night
only
reason
its
not
rated
higher
is
because
the
aftertaste
does
start
to
wear
on
you
and
you
could
only
drink
so
many
an
interesting
beer
probably
somewhat
of
an
acquired
taste
for
most
i
like
it
okay
but
would
not
necessarily
seek
it
out
it
would
be
easy
to
session
though
d
not
too
bad
very
drinkable
not
world
class
but
worth
seeking
out
d
a
very
refreshing
beer
this
was
sour
but
well
balanced
the
taste
is
night
and
light
and
smooth
well
balanced
with
lots
of
different
character
not
too
overpowering
and
has
a
nice
sweet
finish
and
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
but
highly
drinkable
d
the
flavors
are
good
and
its
certainly
not
a
beer
that
will
knock
you
over
with
alcohol
but
the
vinegar
character
and
the
dryness
lead
to
the
beer
being
something
you
cant
drink
too
much
of
d
very
refreshing
just
the
right
amount
of
sourness
and
tartness
going
on
to
make
it
interesting
but
not
overwhelming
could
put
a
couple
of
these
down
after
awhile
the
vinegar
does
wear
a
bit
poured
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
white
head
nose
is
vinegar
fruits
strawberry
perhaps
and
a
definitevtartness
taste
is
self
is
def
tart
from
begining
to
end
great
tasting
blend
of
fruits
nice
body
and
sweet
very
good
brew
on
tap
much
better
versus
bottle
my
wife
loved
it
medium
bodied
with
pretty
mild
carbonation
overall
i
thought
the
sour
component
was
definitely
tamed
and
this
might
be
a
good
introductory
sour
beer
for
the
uninitiated
the
vinegary
aroma
was
offputting
at
first
but
it
seemed
to
come
into
its
own
as
it
warmed
both
aroma
and
flavorwise
a
easily
drinkable
sour
that
i
would
not
mind
drinking
again
d
refreshing
drinkable
and
only
3
a
bottle
d
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
happen
to
love
this
brewery
and
am
very
pleased
that
their
sour
ale
is
as
good
as
it
is
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
11
2
oz
to
glass
clear
brownish
red
tan
head
sour
aromas
a
little
like
sour
milk
or
yogurt
taste
has
a
cloying
sweetness
along
with
the
sour
its
really
like
a
soda
pop
or
maybe
if
martinellis
made
a
sparkling
cherry
and
added
a
few
drops
of
vinegar
for
a
little
extra
pucker
i
havent
had
any
other
sours
but
this
did
not
remind
me
of
beer
still
it
was
fairly
drinkable
went
down
quick
future
outlook
hmmm
this
was
quite
enjoyable
if
i
had
been
served
blindly
i
could
surely
have
been
fooled
into
thinking
i
was
drinking
something
other
than
a
beer
my
initial
impression
is
that
this
was
an
interesting
drink
that
i
will
be
happy
to
have
again
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
tan
head
and
some
light
lace
nose
has
sweet
cherries
ripe
plums
and
tart
yeast
taste
has
more
ripe
fruits
followed
by
a
sour
yeast
presence
and
a
bit
of
funk
crisp
clean
body
is
well
carbonated
tasty
flanders
red
but
not
a
bruin
d
a
good
beer
all
around
but
i
dont
think
it
is
my
cup
a
tea
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
desert
beer
to
split
with
a
few
friends
and
it
would
pair
very
well
with
something
like
cheesecake
as
a
lover
of
sour
brews
ive
developed
a
special
affinity
for
this
beers
different
take
on
sour
the
color
is
a
lovely
clear
but
deep
brown
red
and
on
tap
the
head
is
impressive
the
sour
aroma
and
even
the
tast
of
this
beer
is
very
lactic
yogurty
rather
than
acetic
vinegary
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
not
overly
so
the
sour
lends
to
the
brews
drinkability
without
being
too
tangy
puckery
flavors
hint
at
cherry
crab
apple
molasses
and
plain
yogurt
this
is
an
excellent
first
timers
sour
though
may
not
be
much
like
its
brethren
d
i
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
though
there
are
definitely
things
to
like
about
this
beer
it
just
doesnt
go
down
easily
enough
to
be
highly
drinkable
sour
but
not
mouth
puckeringly
so
seems
a
good
place
to
start
for
someone
wanting
to
get
into
sour
beers
while
i
usually
enjoy
beers
of
this
style
this
is
one
ill
be
passing
on
in
the
future
other
than
the
appearance
and
to
a
lesser
degree
the
aroma
this
beer
had
nothing
about
it
which
beckoned
me
back
for
more
first
time
having
a
beer
of
this
style
it
spilled
everywhere
when
i
opened
the
bottle
after
i
finished
cleaning
up
i
took
a
whiff
and
realized
i
wasnt
going
to
like
this
beer
smells
like
red
wine
vinegar
tastes
like
red
wine
vinegar
cant
say
much
more
about
it
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
and
will
be
staying
away
from
the
style
indefinitely
just
happens
to
offend
my
tastes
drinkability
suffers
from
the
sweetness
without
a
cleansing
sourness
although
sourness
can
dull
the
palate
too
much
id
say
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
it
doesnt
prevent
me
from
drinking
others
bubbly
and
thinner
than
expected
helps
tremendously
in
the
drinkability
this
went
down
very
very
easy
funny
enough
when
buying
this
the
beer
guy
in
the
liquor
store
was
talking
to
another
customer
about
sours
he
said
they
reminded
him
of
a
tart
wine
but
one
that
had
gone
very
very
bad
wtf
this
was
terrifc
and
far
from
his
description
what
shitty
advice
from
that
guy
try
this
if
you
can
the
taste
shows
amplified
versions
of
all
of
the
components
found
in
the
scent
again
with
the
sweet
cherry
brown
sugar
and
lemon
tastes
there
is
an
underwhelming
sour
taste
which
should
show
more
with
age
very
thin
and
sharp
mouthfeel
bode
well
with
the
flavors
i
could
easily
drink
another
one
of
these
drinkability
is
good
but
i
would
not
more
then
maybe
2
in
one
sitting
d
despite
what
ive
herd
about
the
fobs
and
sour
ales
in
general
this
is
a
remarkably
drinkable
ale
it
is
mysterious
and
captivating
its
interesting
yet
not
ridiculous
its
very
very
good
it
may
not
be
the
thing
for
you
but
you
at
least
have
to
try
one
before
you
die
seriously
its
not
maybe
the
sourest
of
the
sour
ales
but
its
drinkable
i
even
got
a
second
one
which
isnt
something
i
can
often
say
for
this
style
would
be
amazing
with
some
strong
cheese
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
one
finger
of
khaki
head
smell
is
vinegar
and
cherries
sour
making
my
mouth
water
already
taste
is
deliciously
sour
cherries
some
jammy
fruits
maybe
raspberries
green
apple
not
as
funky
as
i
was
expecting
medium
bodied
effervescent
nice
dry
finish
extremely
drinkable
and
thirstquenching
id
take
this
over
gatorade
any
day
of
the
week
d
good
if
youre
a
fan
of
sour
ales
reasonably
priced
too
d
definitely
a
sipper
but
again
i
had
a
hard
time
drinking
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
much
better
with
some
food
i
like
this
beer
because
its
an
oddity
and
i
know
im
going
on
a
bit
but
this
taste
sensation
is
so
different
from
anything
ive
tasted
before
that
i
feel
like
sharing
a
lot
notes
probably
a
bit
expensive
to
have
all
of
the
time
but
a
good
and
accesible
example
of
the
style
vs
say
the
petrus
oud
bruin
i
could
drink
more
of
this
tart
beverage
but
i
am
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
a
number
of
them
in
one
sitting
d
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
a
great
departure
but
a
oneafteranother
type
this
one
poured
light
with
a
thick
head
the
smell
was
almost
over
powering
like
sour
apple
cider
the
taste
sour
and
sweet
i
think
a
nice
blend
with
almost
a
wine
finish
the
first
sip
had
a
bite
but
after
a
couple
of
sips
it
went
down
nice
could
not
drink
this
all
day
but
i
would
drink
one
a
day
if
i
could
drinkability
only
a
curiosity
for
me
a
very
occasional
treat
tart
aroma
of
cherry
and
even
a
bit
of
bourbon
or
is
that
me
wishing
it
no
no
bourbon
in
the
quaff
just
the
lightly
sour
cherry
finish
after
a
sweet
start
very
light
bodied
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
in
the
stl
summer
heat
except
the
import
price
will
keep
this
from
being
a
well
stocked
in
the
dbf
recommend
giving
it
a
try
though
overall
this
was
vinegar
galore
with
some
underlying
flavors
that
could
not
pass
the
vinegar
taste
not
recommended
on
tap
pours
a
very
dark
clear
red
with
a
medium
white
head
heavy
acetic
acid
on
the
nose
though
it
doesnt
smell
very
sour
at
all
just
lots
of
vinegar
very
sugary
and
somewhat
vinous
not
incredibly
appetizing
tastes
outright
sweet
again
acetic
notes
but
no
real
tart
character
some
hints
of
artificial
cherry
lightmedium
body
lingering
cloying
sweetness
utter
shite
d
what
a
beautiful
drink
could
go
all
day
with
this
stuff
the
sweetness
is
never
overpowering
nor
the
sourness
just
plain
satisfying
and
refreshing
d
as
much
as
i
enjoyed
the
sour
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
dare
try
more
than
one
in
a
night
however
this
goes
down
smooth
enough
for
me
to
give
it
consideration
final
thought
for
a
highly
rated
beer
im
afraid
what
lessor
beers
of
the
same
style
would
taste
like
not
very
impressed
with
this
guy
d
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
want
this
is
quite
an
enjoyable
sour
beer
paired
up
with
trappist
cheese
for
a
nice
contrast
but
alone
this
beer
is
fine
as
a
drinker
it
is
growing
on
me
as
i
drink
it
maybe
it
wont
be
the
last
d
excellent
will
pick
up
again
in
the
near
future
overall
an
equisite
flemish
sour
ale
the
sweetness
is
appealing
to
me
but
not
at
all
cloying
or
overbearing
a
very
memorable
brew
that
ill
be
seeking
out
fervently
d
very
drinkable
and
one
of
my
new
favorites
for
the
time
being
d
not
a
very
high
abv
drinkable
i
guess
for
a
sour
ale
at
2
99
was
worth
giving
a
try
but
wont
get
again
at
least
it
puts
a
sour
ale
within
the
price
range
of
most
other
beers
drinkability
not
one
id
rush
out
and
stock
but
i
enjoyed
the
experience
drinkability
not
very
for
me
this
is
my
first
sour
and
it
was
nothing
like
i
expected
and
sadly
that
is
not
a
good
thing
i
would
describe
myself
as
someone
who
normally
likes
tart
bitter
types
of
food
so
i
naturally
thought
this
would
be
something
i
would
enjoy
as
of
now
it
is
not
i
may
need
to
give
it
a
few
more
chances
i
still
remember
when
i
could
not
stand
hoppy
beers
like
stone
and
now
i
enjoy
them
thoroughly
overall
not
horrible
but
somewhat
disappointing
d
not
my
thing
i
would
certainly
like
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
both
on
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
but
it
doesnt
work
for
me
i
expected
it
to
have
more
of
a
lactic
sourness
but
all
i
picked
up
here
was
sweet
flavors
and
aromas
this
is
my
first
experience
of
this
style
though
so
perhaps
i
will
grow
to
appreciate
it
more
as
i
come
into
my
own
tastes
more
and
more
i
find
im
a
big
fan
of
sour
beers
this
one
didnt
disappoint
me
for
some
reason
id
like
to
try
some
sweet
and
sour
chicken
with
it
although
it
might
be
too
much
of
the
same
nonetheless
ill
try
it
tasty
beer
and
i
will
revisit
it
soon
cheers
d
the
sweetness
kills
any
chances
of
downing
more
than
one
of
these
nice
highly
recommended
forgot
how
good
this
was
for
any
who
love
the
oud
bruin
style
this
is
not
one
to
be
missed
one
of
the
most
wellrounded
and
nuanced
beers
ive
had
of
any
style
but
damn
near
perfect
as
a
sour
ale
had
this
in
a
bottle
at
the
houston
gingerman
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
a
reddishbrown
color
with
a
thick
head
aroma
of
vinegar
mixed
with
cherries
and
some
light
citrus
notes
quite
tart
flavor
with
more
vinegar
and
cherry
in
the
taste
quite
dry
in
the
finish
pretty
decent
sour
a
little
less
sweet
than
duchess
filled
to
the
top
a
thin
light
head
that
didnt
last
too
dark
to
really
peg
the
color
but
it
looks
ruby
red
right
now
barely
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
all
vinegar
having
a
hard
time
smelling
anything
else
its
actully
so
intense
its
off
putting
i
love
sours
and
im
actually
thinking
this
is
a
bad
keg
based
on
the
bottle
version
i
had
a
year
ago
taste
is
uber
sweet
no
sour
notes
detected
and
im
bummed
barely
getting
some
cherries
but
the
sweet
malts
really
dominate
ultra
heavy
carbonation
element
in
this
draught
really
cleans
the
tongue
after
every
sip
priming
it
for
the
next
swig
really
i
think
this
draught
is
off
not
near
what
i
remember
the
bottle
being
d
smooth
interesting
and
easy
to
drink
id
prefer
a
bit
more
sour
and
a
bit
less
sweetness
but
i
enjoyed
it
d
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
it
is
unique
and
enjoyable
i
would
like
to
see
more
of
this
style
d
very
drinkable
want
to
try
it
again
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
d
not
for
everyone
but
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
you
will
enjoy
this
beer
drink
is
average
at
best
i
wouldnt
really
want
to
try
this
one
again
i
couldnt
see
myself
having
a
couple
or
a
session
with
this
for
the
others
out
there
give
it
a
go
because
it
is
unique
overall
a
good
solid
sour
beer
although
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sours
this
1
is
more
down
the
middle
and
more
my
style
this
is
definitely
a
beer
for
those
who
like
the
style
though
i
can
appreciate
the
beer
it
is
definitely
not
a
beer
for
me
notes
a
really
interesting
beer
that
i
quite
enjoyed
but
i
could
only
really
drink
one
of
these
at
a
time
just
cloying
enough
in
its
sweetness
to
leave
it
a
one
beer
and
move
on
type
of
drink
maybe
if
i
was
more
in
the
mood
i
could
go
for
another
but
at
this
time
it
was
a
tad
much
if
you
get
a
chance
i
would
try
it
just
not
sure
about
going
for
seconds
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
easy
to
have
more
than
one
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
a
few
on
hand
my
only
complaint
was
the
carbonation
but
its
ok
a
few
extra
burps
for
a
good
beer
d
this
is
ok
fine
for
the
style
a
bit
too
sweet
up
front
for
me
frankly
overall
its
just
a
bit
too
in
your
face
id
prefer
something
a
little
more
subdued
theres
other
stuff
thats
just
as
easy
to
find
thats
better
imo
d
eh
im
impressed
by
this
beer
i
didnt
like
it
enough
to
buy
some
more
but
i
respect
the
craft
put
into
this
unique
brew
a
very
offthebeatenpath
brew
thats
worth
checking
out
this
is
one
great
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
something
i
would
highly
recommend
d
rather
drinkable
for
a
sour
overall
a
good
beer
that
ill
likely
try
to
sample
again
a
great
sour
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
duchess
but
for
the
price
5
on
draft
i
havent
found
a
better
flemish
ale
i
didnt
give
it
a
5
0
because
it
is
a
bit
less
intense
than
other
sour
beers
which
might
be
good
for
some
drinkers
and
when
i
want
a
sour
beer
then
i
am
looking
for
a
sour
beer
ranks
fairly
high
on
the
tartsourness
scale
deep
fruitiness
reminds
me
of
the
time
i
was
drugged
to
sleep
by
small
green
gnomes
with
red
pointy
hats
and
sealed
up
in
a
kriek
barrel
for
two
days
and
when
i
woke
up
my
wallet
was
missing
ok
maybe
not
quite
like
that
but
the
fruitiness
is
very
complex
and
unique
still
has
a
slight
vinegary
feel
to
it
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
nosetwitching
aroma
i
like
the
fact
that
i
can
still
detect
some
maltiness
under
all
the
other
flavors
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
a
beer
that
has
tasted
this
much
better
than
it
smells
very
good
brew
that
can
satisfy
a
sour
craving
quite
nicely
poured
in
a
pint
glass
redbrown
with
a
white
head
smell
was
a
little
simple
but
ok
vinegar
cherries
malt
mnn
great
smell
the
flavor
starts
out
just
as
the
smell
but
there
is
a
dark
secret
as
the
vinegar
cherries
and
malt
subside
a
sweetness
remains
yuck
whiskey
tango
foxtrot
fake
sugar
and
lots
of
it
disgusting
diet
soda
faux
sugar
flavor
that
just
lingers
and
makes
me
ill

goodbye

i
hardly
knew
thee
i
couldnt
drink
a
ton
of
this
but
had
no
problems
whatsoever
finishing
my
bottle
interesting
but
not
amazing
d
this
ones
pretty
addicting
though
this
is
my
first
beer
of
the
style
flavors
of
sour
apples
and
cherries
oak
sawdust
and
slight
vinegar
has
that
nice
thirstquenching
effect
on
the
palate
the
way
a
good
flanders
should
have
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
though
also
doesnt
have
the
kind
of
organic
refinement
found
in
a
rodenbach
or
a
duchess
but
its
one
i
recommend
and
wouldnt
mind
returning
to
again
and
again

quickly
mellows
to
a
subtle

sour

of

it
doesnt

pretty
light

i
was

i
was
expecting
more
of
the
jolly

in
your
face
tartness
it
is
a
very
good
intro
to
sours
it
has
some
sour
flavours
without
the
bite
mellows
quite
nicely
from
the
berries
of
the
fruit
overall
just
a
great
beer
even
if
the
name
flemish
sounds
like
something
that
comes
out
of
your
nose
dmuch
more
tame
and
mellow
than
other

was

fans
should
dig
this

everything

good
there
is
always

did

up

the

tastes
like
green

tart

yeast
and
a

great
mix

is

its
a

creamy
and
slick
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
very
smooth
and
quite
enjoyable
i
wish
i
had
another
one
to
drink
right
now
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
i
think
its
a
good
overall
oud
bruin
an
interesting
beer
lots
of
smells
and
tastes
packed
in
this
baby
not
sure
if
it
works
though
different
from
other
oud
bruins
not
as
sour
and
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
interesting
nonetheless
d
sorry
if
this
score
is
not
fair
i
could
probably
only
drink
one
or
two
of
these
in
a
night
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
terrific
for
what
it
is
d
good
sipper
my
acquaintance
with
sour
ales
is
in
the
novice
phase
and
i
think
i
started
with
a
pretty
good
one
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
it
is
good
to
mix
things
up
mouthfeel
is
tart
and
carbonated
but
very
pleasant
especially
after
shooting
some
hoops
at
2
99
this
will
be
a
regular
in
my
rotation
along
with
duchesse
and
rodenbach
damn
good
dont
pass
it
up
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
its
low
alcohol
content
and
crisp
mouthfeel
facilitate
extreme
drinkability
very
good
beer
to
enjoy
watching
the
beginning
of
underworld
rise
of
the
lycans
maybe
there
is
also
something
about
sours
and
werewolves
recommended
to
any
drinker
of
any
beverage
very
drinkable
very
well
done
d
i
find
it
very
drinkable
a
beer
that
the
wine
folks
would
appreciate
as
well
taste
is
crisp
and
carbonated
to
start
you
get
the
cherries
the
most
very
sour
not
as
much
funk
in
the
taste
as
in
the
smell
it
is
kind
of
light
in
body
you
get
a
lot
of
cherry
flavor
right
away
but
seems
to
disappear
quickly
there
is
also
a
muted
malt
taste
underneath
the
cherries
maybe
the
lighter
mouthfeel
makes
you
want
to
drink
a
little
more
because
it
doesnt
give
you
a
blanket
of
phlegm
and
sour
taste
in
your
mouth
but
could
be
better
balanced
blipped
monk
time
by
the
monks
first
sour
cant
wait
for
my
second
dnot
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
for
me
more
of
a
treat
i
hear
once
yo
go
sour
you
never
go
back
and
that
fact
with
this
one
scares
me
a
little
with
how
much
i
like
it
mouth
is
dry
and
crisp
moderate
carbonation
drinks
slowly
but
smoothly
lingers
with
the
sour
aftertaste
just
begging
to
be
discovered
overall
a
very
solid
flemish
ale
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
this
was
very
well
put
together
highly
drinkable
and
something
that
i
would
not
turn
my
nose
at
if
i
ever
received
it
again
very
well
done
overall
its
refreshing
and
tasty
but
its
not
as
smooth
as
some
other
sours
ive
had
its
a
sipper
for
sure
but
it
will
probably
be
a
little
while
before
i
run
back
to
this

pretty

i
would
say
the

its
not
going

knock
you
flat

the

it

the

a

down

a
good

of
stick

the

and
looks
like
it
has
no
intentions
of
letting
go
aroma
is
big
and
sour
with
rhubarb
cranberries
and
green
apples
a
good
dose
of
vinegar
borderline
salad
dressing
which
is
a
bit
much
for
my
nostrils
when
it
comes
to
beer
taste
starts
off
pretty
sweet
with
cherries
red
grapes
and
pears
midway
a
bit
of
tart
emerges
with
sweet
candy
flavors
hmmm
grape
sweet
tart
anyone
the
smell
though
is
definitely
stronger
in
the
sourvinegary
category
a
light
to
medium
body
with
a
somewhat
creamy
feel
id
prefer
it
lighter
with
a
bit
more
tingle
in
the
mouth
for
the
style

nose
grape
juice
on

meh
not
terrible
but
there
are
sooo
many
better
sours
out
there
to
be
enjoyed
for
me
to
return
to
this
one
head
falls
apart
quickly
body
is
a
light
translucent
brown
with
amber
and
red
hues
aromas
of
umami
cherry
alcohol
tartness
and
green
apple
so
sour
this
is
awesome
so
sweet
like
candy
good
balance
of
bitter
green
apple
plum
cherry
cider
vinegar
aftertaste
is
ketchup
it
works
though
very
good
body
and
carbonation
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
easy
on
the
palate
and
delicious
d
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
very
tasty
would
buy
this
one
again
im
pretty
impressed
this
may
be
one
of
my
favorite
flanders
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
unbelievably
drinkable
with
all
the
notes
i
love
its
a
bit
lacking
in
that
extreme
funkiness
that
keeps
it
from
being
outstanding
but
on
the
whole
its
a
beautifully
rounded
flanders
oud
bruin
delicious
pours
a
clear
ruby
nose
is
granny
smith
apples
cranberries
cider
flavor
is
apples
raspberries
champagne
the
finish
is
a
pronounced
sweet
tartness
evoking
cranberries
or
currants
feel
is
bubbly
like
a
sparkling
wine
the
sourness
is
very
enjoyable
and
does
not
compromise
drinkability
like
some
sour
beers
very
enjoyable
drinkability
i
will
have
this
again
and
could
have
several
i
found
this
to
be
an
excellent
value
for
the
price
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
starter
sour
as
it
is
not
as
overpoweringly
sour
as
others
i
have
tried
the
flavor
is
still
there
though
had
at
local
44
in
philly
poured
a
dark
reddish
purple
into
a
tulip
with
a
two
finger
cream
colored
head
which
was
very
resilient
the
smell
was
unlike
any
other
beer
i
have
ever
had
very
fruity
yet
crisp
and
dry
at
the
end
smell
of
apples
soaked
in
brandy
grapes
cinnamon
and
spices
more
like
a
desert
wine
or
fine
liquor
than
a
beer
in
smell
taste
was
similar
with
very
fruity
sour
apple
taste
at
the
front
then
crisp
dry
and
bitter
spices
at
the
end
carbonation
was
medium
and
pleasant
i
just
wanted
to
swish
it
around
my
mouth
and
keep
it
there
to
have
that
phenomenally
complex
taste
with
me
forever
my
new
favorite
beer
too
bad
this
is
so
hard
to
find
because
it
is
other
worldly
truly
a
unique
and
beautiful
thing
great
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
just
an
outstanding
beer
i
am
probably
a
bit
nostalgic
and
will
score
higher
than
the
average
but
imo
i
am
completely
justified
i
love
the
combination
of
sweet
and
sour
funk
and
fruit
awesome
pours
a
really
clear
deep
copper
color
with
a
huge
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
but
leaves
fluffy
sticky
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
of
lactic
acid
sweet
malts
a
bit
of
lemon
and
sour
cherries
taste
is
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
has
that
sour
twang
about
it
more
lemons
and
sour
cherries
and
sweet
malts
in
the
taste
leaves
a
sweet
and
sour
taste
in
my
mouth
pass
the
chinese
food
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
a
bit
sticky
carbonation
is
on
the
high
side
prickling
the
tongue
with
every
sip
body
is
medium
decent
sour
ale
but
i
thought
it
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
the
style
maybe
more
like
a
beginners
sour
ale
but
still
tasty
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
sliding
over
the
tongue
feels
like
poprocks
like
i
said
before
strong
flavors
linger
a
bit
too
long
though
the
poor
finish
on
this
beer
ruins
the
drinkability
for
me
maybe
its
just
something
i
have
to
get
used
to
ive
only
had
a
few
sour
beers
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
pink
tinted
tan
head
that
leaves
fine
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
tart
cherries
and
citrus
with
a
mild
yeasty
funkiness
tastes
of
tart
underripe
fruit
nice
sour
puckering
quality
with
some
sweet
maltiness
underneath
well
balanced
and
medium
bodied
with
seltzery
carbonation
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
a
niceapproachable
example
of
the
style
md
a
tad
bit
highly
carbonated
for
my
impressions
of
the
style
but
it
still
works
pretty
well
because
of
the
sugary
sweetness
that
isnt
as
counterbalanced
by
the
sourness
that
i
would
like
id
probably
skip
having
more
than
one
of
these
still
pretty
enjoyable
though
a
great
beer
reminds
me
of
why
i
love
these
beers
smooth
malty
sour
yet
pleasant
all
the
way
through
its
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
this
beer

my

this
is
delicious
complex

drinkable
definitely
a
solid
beer
for
any
sourhead
out
there
this
beer
poured
a
ruby
hazy
red
color
with
a
very
thin
head
the
aroma
was
teh
best
part
of
this
beer
it
smelled
of
candy
sugar
and
cherries
i
found
the
beer
to
be
overly
sweet
at
first
sip
but
as
the
beer
warmed
it
started
getting
more
sour
this
would
be
a
great
transitional
beer
for
someone
getting
into
sours
for
the
price
a
great
sour
now
im
just
gonna
have
to
pop
one
more
to
get
another
look
at
this
beauty
d
wow
i
loved
this
stuff
especially
the
sour
aspect
of
the
ale
very
unique
based
on
this
introduction
i
feel
compelled
to
explore
the
flanders
oud
bruin
style
drinkability
if
you
like
this
style
then
i
would
imagine
this
is
a
brew
for
you
personally
this
is
something
i
wanted
to
try
just
to
say
i
tried
it
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
many
of
these
in
my
lifetime
i
enjoyed
this
was
not
what
i
expected
with
my
first
try
at
a
sour
ale
d
nice
beer
but
i
dont
agree
with
everyone
else
about
the
level
of
tartness
ive
had
more
tartsour
beers
and
id
like
this
one
to
match
those
a
little
better
monks
flemish
sour
red
ale
is
good
beer
i
like
it
it
doesnt
really
wow
in
any
respect
but
its
pretty
good
all
around
the
tart
flavor
could
actually
be
toned
down
a
bit
and
it
might
be
a
little
better
but
thats
probably
true
to
style
i
cant
say
im
enamored
with
these
types
of
beers
despite
the
fact
that
i
do
like
them
in
any
event
it
is
recommended
and
definitely
worth
checking
out

2oz

strong

with
a
slight
scent

reading
the

guidelines
this

may
be
old

it
says
the

should
not

taste
is
also
like
vinegar
and
sour
cherries
not
malty
at
all
as
the
guideline
says
it
should
be
its
so
acetic
it
burns
my
nose
after
taking
a
drink
improves
slightly
as
it
warms
but
still
way
too
much
like
drinking
vinegar
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
that
drys
out
the
mouth

drinking
red

not
drinkable

all
to
me
the
drain
is
going
to
enjoy
this
beer
more
than
me
ive
enjoyed
all
the
sours
ive
ever
had
but
this
one
this
one
is
a
drainpour
i
will
try
this
again
to
see
if
maybe
i
just
got
an
old
bottle
and
rereview
if
thats
the
case
otherwise
i
would
advise
to
be
wary
of
this
beer
unless
you
ike
drinking
vinegar
d
at
3
this
beer
is
a
steal
and
ill
grab
more
d
this
really
couldnt
be
any
easier
to
drink
the
light
body
and
immense
complexity
of
flavors
make
each
sip
exquisite
and
theres
new
tastes
to
pick
out
each
time
extremely
interesting
but
tame
enough
that
it
never
becomes
overpowering
another
great
experience
with
a
flemish
sour
clear
rust
color
with
an
ecru
head
thats
fizzy
but
is
kept
alive
by
an
etching
at
the
bottom
of
my
goblet
black
cherry
aroma
with
some
brown
sugar
and
vinegar
flavor
is
sweet
with
cherry
and
apple
juice
a
touch
of
vinaigrette
and
some
caramel
not
very
sour
really
and
barely
even
tart
definitely
more
sweet
than
anything
body
is
very
light
bordering
on
thin
astringent
dryness
and
a
little
metallic
character
overcarbonated
overall
i
would
recommend
but
be
ready
for
something
new
if
youve
never
tried
a
flanders
bruin
smell
has
some
sour
cherry
sweetness
and
a
little
yeasty
funk
taste
is
smooth
with
a
complicated
sweet
and
sour
fruitiness
there
is
some
sour
tartness
on
the
tongue
but
not
the
biting
vinegar
sourness
i
was
afraid
of
a
touch
of
wood
or
oak
earthy
smooth
mouthfeel
low
level
of
carbonation
make
it
easy
too
easy
to
drink
tiny
touch
of
alcohol
but
adds
rather
than
detracts
from
the
complexity
11
2
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
piraat
tulip
shaped
glass
beer
forms
a
nice
3
finger
head
and
a
cascade
of
bubbles
keeps
the
head
alive
for
several
minutes
or
so
dark
reddish
brown
in
color
and
nice
lace
formation
on
the
glass
this
definitely
looks
like
a
quaffable
libation
smells
like
sour
apples
think
jolly
ranchers
and
that
typical
funk
you
get
from
this
style
smelled
enticing
but
not
nearly
as
pungent
as
i
would
have
liked
the
smell
is
a
good
harbinger
for
the
taste
the
flavors
of
sweet
and
sour
come
through
with
a
cherry
apple
finish
its
a
well
balanced
beer
but
the
taste
was
just
not
quite
as
strong
in
those
flavors
as
i
would
have
liked
i
wouldnt
say
the
beer
is
watery
but
i
wanted
to
see
the
flavor
and
the
sweet
and
sour
contrast
come
through
with
more
ferocity
alcohol
presence
is
really
invisible
and
that
fact
coupled
with
the
subtle
flavor
composition
makes
it
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
in
high
quantity
if
youre
so
inclined
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
fell
a
little
short
of
my
expectations
if
youve
never
had
a
beer
of
this
style
and
want
to
start
with
something
mellow
this
is
probably
a
good
bet
for
you
the
only
other
ive
had
in
this
realm
not
the
same
style
i
realize
is
rrs
consecration
so
that
may
have
stacked
the
deck
in
any
event
i
found
this
a
good
introductory
beer
for
novices
such
as
myself

had
let
this
chill
down
a
little
more
poured
a
translucent

a
tight
two
inch
offwhite

pockmarked
on
the
surface

composed
of
compressed
tiny
bubbles

head
eventually
recedes
into
a

dense

with
spatters
coating
the
opposite
side
of
the
bowl
nose
indicated
some
acidity
off
the
bat
suggests
sour
cherries
taste
consistent
with
nose
but
sour
character
is
muted
and
even
not
overly
bold
upfront
but
consistent
throughout
the
tasting
experience
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
a
slight
acidity
at
the
finish
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
with
a
low
abv
makes
this
a
great
introduction
for
sour
beer
newbies
like
myself
d
i
thought
it
was
good
but
i
think
there
are
some
better
out
there
for
sure
duchesse
was
a
little
better
i
think
d
a
real
nice
flemish
brown
ale
and
one
of
the
best
bargain
sours
out
there
paired
well
with
some
goat
cheese
i
was
eating
recommended
as
a
good
introduction
the
sour
styles
served
on
draft
at
the
thirsty
monk
in
asheville
nc
pours
a
ruby
red
color
with
a
small
white
head
large
vinegar
aromas
alongside
strawberry
fruitiness
more
tart
vinegar
in
the
flavor
a
little
too
vinegary
in
my
opinion
slippery
mouthfeel
with
okay
drinkability
certainly
different
than
most
other
styles
this
is
one
of
the
first
one
of
the
style
i
have
had
and
my
interest
is
piqued
overall
a
very
well
done
oud
bruin
and
would
gladly
have
again
this
dark
brown
brew
arrived
with
a
light
head
that
clung
to
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
beer
had
a
huge
green
apple
component
mixed
with
fruity
belgian
funk
and
a
little
vinegar
a
light
maltiness
almost
a
sweetness
pervades
the
palate
up
front
but
it
is
quickly
gives
way
to
an
intense
sourness
the
sourness
is
unripe
green
apples
tart
cherries
and
if
it
were
blistering
hot
day
very
refreshing
this
beer
is
very
interesting
and
i
liked
it
i
wish
there
were
more
of
this
style
around
d
next
time
i
would
have
a
second
one
a
great
session
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
smooth
easy
carbonation
that
makes
all
of
the
complex
flavors
and
attributes
effortless
to
enjoy
a
bit
expensive
for
such
a
small
sized
import
but
certainly
worth
it
and
one
id
enjoy
again
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
a
dense
lingering
slightly
tan
head
no
belgian
lacing
to
speak
of
huge
vinegar
like
aroma
not
the
same
as
rodenbach
a
bit
thin
on
the
body
indicating
low
alcohol
very
sweet
with
an
underlying
dry
tartness
like
from
a
biting
into
a
lemon
very
fruity
almost
cherry
like
a
good
intro
to
the
style
in
that
respect
but
it
doesnt
stand
up
to
rodenbach
pours
with
a
thin
head
which
eventually
falls
into
a
sheet
over
most
of
the
liquid
surface
lacing
runs
up
the
glass
in
veins
brown
to
burnt
orange
in
hue
more
yellow
at
the
rims
while
deep
it
is
also
clear
enough
to
view
the
bubble
beads
the
nose
is
broad
and
you
feel
the
beers
presence
in
your
nostrils
however
its
not
trying
to
bowl
you
over
beyond
the
dense
candied
cherry
and
green
apple
fruit
scents
and
damp
forest
floor
matter
its
a
man
of
few
words
any
vinegar
notes
subordinate
to
the
fruit
freshly
rolled
bread
dough
and
dried
orange
peels
about
the
whole
of
the
rest
mediumbodied
streamlined
and
without
any
fat
on
the
bones
the
carbonation
disrupts
the
sourness
as
it
enters
the
mouth
and
lets
it
soak
in
before
you
start
to
pucker
the
cherry
apple
apricot
fruit
remains
the
star
of
the
show
and
sweetens
the
lemon
orange
citrus
appreciably
the
uncooked
dough
element
there
very
very
lightly
spiced
and
again
the
vinegar
component
barely
registers
full
through
the
finish
lingers
tactfully
for
its
type
could
put
down
a
few
in
a
row
off
the
tap
at
american
flatbread
i
tried
this
with
a
lady
whos
chest
was
a
big
as
this
was
tart
in
other
words
this
beer
was
really
freaking
tart
my
glass
was
delivered
to
me
with
a
thin
khaki
head
atop
a
mahoganycopper
colored
liquid
the
lacing
was
sticky
and
the
retention
great
the
aroma
was
very
sour
with
some
hints
of
vinegar
but
it
was
still
appealing
being
wrapped
around
a
pale
malt
base
the
flavors
were
similar
hints
of
vinegar
sour
green
apples
slightly
toasted
malt
tart
cherries
and
citrus
notes
of
orange
and
lemon
lots
of
acidic
fruit
presence
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
medium
the
carbonation
medium
a
very
unusual
style
of
beer
but
one
of
the
best
examples
of
it
i
know
of
d
at
5
50
and
it
being
so
readily
available
in
my
area
this
one
is
always
a
go
to
for
me
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
fix
and
funds
are
tight
this
is
the
solution
a
great
candidate
for
this
style
brewed
by
a
respectable
belgian
brewery
for
america
what
more
can
i
ask
for
im
glad
to
see
this
getting
wide
distribution
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
and
at
3
29
i
can
see
myself
having
it
again
sometime
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
im
not
usually
a
sour
ale
fan
but
is
one
that
i
liked
and
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
first
sours
and
i
thought
it
was
a
real
treat
i
was
kind
of
scared
of
it
tasting
like
feet
or
vinegar
after
reading
some
forum
posts
on
sour
beers
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
woodiness
was
a
nice
touch
id
like
to
drink
another
but
i
only
bought
one
overall
i
like
the
beer
there
is
no
doubt
it
took
time
and
hardwork
to
produce
and
they
certainly
came
out
with
an
impressive
flemish
red
however
i
would
leave
it
at
just
a
flemish
red
upon
a
taste
you
will
find
there
is
nothing
very
sour
about
it
mouthfeel
is
jumbled
and
too
effervescent
a
little
too
sweet
to
do
more
than
one
after
sitting
out
for
a
bit
its
carbonation
dulled
accentuating
the
cola
taste
even
more
so
nice
beer
for
an
experience
and
would
work
well
as
a
toast
but
as
far
as
sessioning
its
just
a
bit
too
unique
drinkability
very
good
considering
its
only
5
5
and
the
fact
that
it
has
such
a
refreshing
finish
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
these
eventhough
there
might
be
too
much
malty
sweetness
its
really
easy
to
drink
i
will
revisit
this
one
in
the
summertime
i
must
admit
this
is
the
first
sour
beer
ive
had
and
it
will
take
me
some
time
to
purchase
another
bottle
it
was
not
easy
for
me
drink
this
is
an
interesting
beer
but
the
simplicity
of
it
all
limits
the
drinkability
for
me
surely
a
nice
toasting
brew
a
champagne
with
a
head
definitely
worth
a
try
an
interesting
style
id
like
to
try
a
few
other
examples
of
interesting
example
of
the
style
that
has
a
lot
of
nice
characteristics
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
you
should
only
try
it
if
you
are
looking
for
something
to
challenge
your
palate
this
is
my
first
beer
from
this
style
and
i
must
say
its
unlike
anything
ive
ever
tried
the
taste
is
very
complex
and
comes
at
you
in
waves
of
different
flavors
i
will
definitely
try
more
of
this
style
pours
a
dark
red
color
shines
like
a
ruby
a
white
fluffy
head
sits
on
top
giving
some
lacing
but
the
head
sort
of
fades
which
helps
you
get
straight
to
the
beer
the
smell
reminds
me
of
easter
dying
eggs
just
like
vinegar
a
bit
of
apple
cider
and
white
wine
thrown
in
too
the
taste
is
just
what
id
expect
like
apple
cider
vinegar
a
good
balance
between
sweetness
and
sourness
like
red
wine
but
leaning
a
bit
more
towards
sour
not
a
whole
lot
of
puckering
tartness
but
a
great
taste
the
carbonation
makes
it
a
bit
interesting
and
theres
plenty
to
seek
out
in
this
beer
i
liked
it
i
could
sip
on
it
for
a
very
long
time
and
would
definitely
purchase
again
if
given
the
opportunity
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
pick
this
up
if
you
see
it
and
the
next
time
im
in
philly
i
hope
to
stop
in
for
a
glass
the
pur
is
a
cloudby
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
white
head
initial
smell
is
of
vinigar
mixing
with
spice
the
first
sip
is
mostly
a
strong
vinigar
flavor
is
quickly
followed
by
a
bittersweet
blast
of
firmented
dark
fruit
i
can
definitely
taste
hints
of
the
oak
coming
through
to
further
give
the
brew
a
flacor
reminiscent
of
vinous
almost
cabernetlike
flacor
the
finish
has
a
hint
of
clove
spice
to
further
round
out
the
palate
wow
this
is
really
an
odly
balanced
flanders
the
sweetness
that
balanced
the
sourness
of
the
brew
is
almost
awkward
and
unexpected
but
it
really
works
for
this
one
an
excelent
brew
that
i
would
have
again
in
a
heartbeat
very
good
stuff
now
i
know
what
ill
be
drinking
on
new
years
eve
instead
of
champagne
impressions
this
brew
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
colored
port
the
smell
the
texture
the
sweetness
the
the
flavors
very
intriguing
and
like
a
good
port
this
would
pair
fine
with
a
dessert
or
stand
alone
as
an
afterdinner
drink
it
also
occurred
to
me
that
due
to
the
effervescence
and
distinctly
winey
taste
of
this
particular
beer
it
would
make
a
fun
substitute
to
champagne
on
new
years
eve
hows
that
for
a
way
to
introduce
your
friends
and
family
to
the
world
of
unusual
beers
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
its
brown
in
color
interweaved
with
dark
red
and
with
hues
of
orange
lovely
color
even
cooler
when
you
shine
a
light
through
it
the
nose
is
tart
like
strawberries
and
phenolic
its
a
good
smell
but
it
lacks
robustness
for
that
higher
score
taste
sweet
and
sour
sauce
me
likey
tart
and
sugary
sweet
upfront
light
on
the
sourness
and
more
focused
on
a
sweet
flavor
burnt
caramel
sweet
sour
apples
some
might
say
its
cloying
but
its
working
for
me
delightful
and
not
too
heavy
intro
to
sour
beer
101
is
right
here
d
this
is
the
best
of
the
few
sours
ive
had
but
the
sourness
could
be
offputting
to
some
maybe
not
the
best
introduction
for
those
hesitant
to
try
a
sour
but
it
worked
for
me
d
good
drinkability
for
a
sour
still
limited
to
1
or
2
at
best
very
easy
drinking
not
as
full
flavored
or
complex
as
i
had
hoped
but
still
quite
enjoyable
rerate

aroma
of
tart

raspberry
in
particular
and
a
slight
hint
of
something
else
that
reminds
me
of
oatmeal
flavor
of
balsamic
vinegar
and
sour
fruits
this
is
still
quite
delicious
and
i
will
leave
my

smooth
and
easily
drinkable
fairly
high
carbonation
makes
it
lively
and
helps
lift
all
the
flavors
off
the
tongue
making
it
more
drinkable
d
a
very
nice
sour
not
my
usual
style
but
a
nice
treat
d
high
drinkability
for
a
sour
good
balance
between
sweetness
tartness
and
funkiness
i
didnt
notice
an
excess
of
acidity
well
reasonably
priced
also
this
one
was
really
good
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
not
enough
sour
i
would
maybe
get
it
again
but
i
certainly
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
an
enjoyable
milder
sour
ale
amongst
the
others
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
thick
beige
pillowy
head
aromas
of
strawberries
and
bland
gueze
lil
sweet
bit
of
cherry
cola
warms
into
a
red
wine
zing
less
exciting
that
other
sour
reds
but
provides
a
safe
staple
of
the
style
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
is
incredibly
pleasant
to
sip
on
i
poured
a
11
2
ounce
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
in
color
with
a
fuzzy
white
head
when
the
beer
is
held
up
to
a
light
it
becomes
very
translucent
and
almost
looks
red
the
smell
is
kind
of
funky
but
in
a
good
way
it
is
a
bit
like
a
red
wine
vinegar
in
aroma
the
beer
is
like
drinking
a
vinegary
drink
only
sweeter
perhaps
a
sweet
and
sour
drink
the
flavor
is
acidic
with
a
lingering
sweet
finish
the
brew
is
a
medium
bodied
sipper
with
high
carbonation
i
liked
this
beer
because
of
its
funky
taste
but
i
do
not
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
a
nice
alternative
to
highly
hopped
beers
trying
this
for
the
second
or
third
time
out
of
a
11
2
oz
bottle
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
its
not
bad
but
something
about
the
taste
isnt
for
me
i
think
its
a
little
too
sweet
and
that
the
sugars
are
a
bit
muddled
the
sour
finish
is
nice
the
beer
looks
beautiful
overall
excellent
beer
and
an
excellent
sour
rodenbach
grand
cru
is
in
my
opinion
the
benchmark
for
the
style
but
this
beer
is
much
more
approachable
big
on
flavor
without
the
rip
your
tounge
sourness
of
rgc
balanced
even
if
you
can
find
this
stuff
pick
it
up
drinkability
i
find
this
to
be
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
and
one
that
might
be
a
good
gateway
beer
into
the
realm
of
sour
beer
its
not
too
sour
but
theres
enough
there
to
make
it
a
new
taste
for
most
people
drinkability
im
dinging
this
a
bit
because
i
find
it
fairly
undrinkable
i
know
the
tartness
and
the
sourness
is
tostyle
but
for
my
palate
its
fairly
overwhelming
ive
given
it
credit
in
the
higher
categories
so
i
dont
feel
bad
for
dropping
its
score
a
bit
here
the

carbo
very
sweet
beer
good
though
d
it
is
okay
but
i
would
definitely
want
to
throw
some
more
down
and
see
what
it
does
with
age
huge
duvellike
head
of
foam
liquid
is
reddishbrown
and
clear
aroma
is
acetic
and
fruity
like
a
vinegar
made
from
wine
and
apple
cider
taste
initially
is
sour
but
this
leaves
quickly
leaving
a
lightly
sweet
cherry
flavor
it
tastes
nothing
like
beer
im
used
to
no
malt
or
hop
notes
finish
is
clean
with
almost
no
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
slightly
flat
maybe
i
poured
it
wrong
i
dont
know
id
drink
a
second
bottle
if
one
was
available
but
then
move
on
d
if
you
can
stand
sour
beer
this
is
probably
a
good
one
the
body
is
not
as
dry
for
a
typical
sour
really
easy
drinking
though
overall
it
reminds
me
of
duchesse
but
toned
down
excellent
smoothness
excellent
drinkability
i
think
it
was
better
in
the
bottle
or
at
least
i
remember
it
being
better
this
is
something
im
going
to
have
to
come
back
to
this
seems
like
a
good
beer
for
people
that
dont
really
get
into
beer
this
is
only
the
second
dark
sour
ive
had
and
it
has
made
me
determined
to
seek
more
out
fairly
drinkable
nothing
special
but
pretty
good
pours
a
beautiful
rustybrown
with
a
small
18
inch
tan
head
smells
of
sour
grapesapples
and
wine
first
sip
is
sour
and
sweet
with
cherrys
grapes
being
the
dominate
fruits
a
carbonation
consistency
and
mouthfeel
of
a
wine
cooler
this
is
a
refreshing
sipper
and
was
much
enjoyed
d
this
may
be
a
slightly
generic
sour
but
its
a
wellcrafted
one
i
would
have
no
problem
at
all
with
putting
away
a
750
of
this
on
my
own
definitely
a
session
drinker
tastes
of
tart
lambic
yeasts
cherries
apples
wow
this
really
is
mouth
puckering
not
as
good
as
duchesse
de
bourgongne
but
decent
i
enjoy
this
style
immensely
and
this
is
a
classic
example
solidhighly
reccomended
md
full
bodied
and
very
well
carbonated
a
little
sticky
in
the
mouth
the
high
sourness
of
the
beer
makes
it
a
little
tough
but
as
it
warms
the
flavors
mellow
and
it
is
very
drinkable
d
an
interesting
beer
certainly
worth
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
sours
drinkability
very
drinkable
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
want
to
polish
off
more
than
1
or
two
in
a
night
but
pleasant
d
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
i
would
have
hoped
since
trying
it
on
tap
once
before
still
a
pretty
solid
choice
if
you
are
looking
to
get
into
sour
beers
and
dont
know
where
to
begin
overall
im
a
fan
and
purchase
this
beer
by
the
case
drinks
pretty
good
for
the
style
probably
not
sour
enough
for
true
flemish
red
fans
i
liked
this
one
definitely
something
worth
trying
to
me
but
wasnt
something
i
particularly
enjoyed
d
not
very
high
though
i
could
take
down
a
few
still
a
lot
of
fruit
good
tanginess
and
puckering
in
the
finish
for
days
lightish
body
but
not
too
bad
im
not
hugely
pleased
by
the
overbearing
acidity
here
i
guess
go
for
the
bottle
unless
youre
near
philly
and
you
know
youre
getting
a
good
fresh
keg
carbonation
is
sitting
pretty
just
has
that
touch
about
her
body
is
thin
juicy
but
it
spreads
itself
out
too
far
trying
to
keep
everyone
happy
a
little
brashness
is
healthy
every
now
then
body
shy
of
medium
with
loose
carbonation
a
slippery
mouthfeel
and
superb
drinkability
a
definate
session
sour
perhaps
not
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
but
you
cant
beat
the
price
d
very
drinkable
love
the
huge
taste
and
low
abv
definitely
grab
this
again
if
in
philly
taste
mouthfeel
fruity
sweetness
followed
by
mild
sourness
which
leads
way
to
a
sweetsour
finish
id
like
a
bit
less
sweetness
but
this
is
pleasant
enough
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
syrupy
decent
but
far
from
great
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
there
was
a
ton
of
flavor
pleasant
and
mild
for
the
most
part
it
did
not
come
in
as
sour
as
i
feared
it
may
have
good
flavor
and
balance
to
it
and
one
i
definitely
would
not
object
to
having
again
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
i
will
say
that
it
was
better
than
the
bottle
but
still
a
good
sour
none
the
less
this
was
a
little
acidic
a
little
tangy
and
a
little
tart
but
not
a
lot
of
any
one
of
thing
which
made
it
tremendously
drinkable
the
degree
of
must
the
oak
brought
with
it
gave
this
beer
a
lot
of
charm
it
was
a
kind
of
charm
i
remember
smelling
a
lot
of
while
in
belgium
flanders
oud
bruins
are
now
reason
number
878
for
me
to
move
there
d
tasty
and
refreshing
love
the
sweet
and
sour
flavors
i
really
wish
brewers
would
attempt
these
sours
belgian
styles
as
opposes
to
triple
and
wits
recommended
drinkability
not
really
my
type
of
beer
i
have
had
the
rodenbach
red
and
really
loved
it
similar
type
of
beer
though
not
as
overwhelmingly
vinegaresque
low
alcohol
so
you
could
have
a
few
if
you
like
the
taste
i
havent
had
many
of
this
type
so
i
cant
really
say
how
it
compares
to
other
sour
ales
pours
a
dark
russet
color
with
a
sticky
tenacious
cafeaulait
head
from
the
looks
of
it
it
could
be
a
belgian
dubbel
the
nose
has
the
telltale
marks
of
acetic
acid
along
with
some
sweeter
smells
marshmallow
on
the
palate
theres
a
brisk

off
then
a

finish

off

is
medium
for
the

with

the
middle
overall
this
is
quite
a
nice
flemish
sour
ale
it
doesnt
have
a
ton
of
depth
but
what
is
here
is
balanced
and
pleasant
this
one
is
a
little
tough
to
choke
down
decently
made
but
probably
not
my
thing
monks

a

nose
is
mostly

taste
initial
tart
fruit
which
dries
quickly
into
a
mineral
like
finish
dry
and
wood
in
finish
as
well
would
score
higher
but
the
hard
water
taste
is
a
bit
much
crisp
on
the
tongue
and
goes
down
easy
just
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
borderline
drainpour
this
noxious
brew
is
sickly
a
mishmash
of
conflicting
flavors
and
should
be
taken
behind
the
barn
and
put
out
of
its
misery
if
you
are
trying
to
get
a
woman
who
doesnt
normally
care
for
beer
interested
in
it
this
is
where
i
would
start
not
overly
imposing
or
intense
but
still
firmly
showing
off
a
solid
sweetsour
tart
flavor
cherry
is
the
dominant
sour
fruit
flavor
with
solid
carbonation
and
a
nice
tart
pucker
on
the
finish
definitely
not
to
be
confused
with
the
carbonated
cherry
juice
that
is
sometimes
sold
as
a
sour
fruit
beer
a
la
kasteel
rouge
or
some
framboises
the
taste
is
deliciously
tart
it
has
a
slight
metallic
taste
upfront
sour
cherries
syrupy
in
consistancy
pretty
delicious
that
finishes
by
giving
you
a
nice
pinch
of
sourness
on
the
back
of
the
throat
really
enjoyable
beer
not
much
to
complain
about
or
quibble
with
oall
a
very
different
kind
of
beer
believe
there
are
other
examples
that
are
slightly
better
but
highly
drinkable
if
youve
got
a
thing
for
gently
sour
beverages
drinkability
i
really
dig
sour
beers
this
one
is
good
not
great
yet
its
always
nice
to
try
new
sour
beers
i
am
not
a
frequenter
of
the
style
but
this
beer
may
change
that
not
sure
i
would
be
drinking
this
all
night
but
it
certainly
is
a
great
change
from
other
styles
i
wish
i
had
some
sharp
cheeses
to
sample
with
this
poured
into
a
snifter
and
received
a
murky
brown
body
with
a
onefinger
head
that
stuck
around
a
long
time
and
left
a
lace
ring
a
sour
smell
mixed
with
malts
and
some
citric
notes
closer
to
dark
fruit
but
ill
leave
it
at
that
combined
with
some
caramel
or
butter
also
a
tad
spicy
very
sour
but
a
good
sour
with
a
smooth
body
and
a
bitter
fruit
taste
a
little
hop
kick
or
spicy
note
something
like
pepper
that
jolts
the
tip
of
the
tongue
then
something
akin
to
sweet
malts
and
fruit
cherry
being
the
most
prevelant
hits
the
tastebuds
as
it
is
going
down
making
for
a
mediumbodied
beer
that
is
balanced
and
not
rough
i
dont
like
sour
drinks
period
but
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
session
it
because
it
might
leave
a
funny
taste
after
a
while
think
too
much
oj
but
i
recommend
to
all
to
try
this
beer
take
my
review
in
comparison
to
other
sour
ales
drinkability
is
scored
high
but
my
hats
off
to
anyone
who
could
drink
sour
ales
all
night
long
it
is
an
interesting
and
unique
style
but
hardly
matches
well
with
most
foods
and
definately
the
sour
taste
lingers
in
your
mouth
well
after
your
drink
is
finished
similiar
to
a
strong
ipa
d
however
the
sheer
richness
of
this
beers
flavor
would
not
sit
well
with
me
after
more
than
two
i
do
recommend
grabbing
this
beer
if
you
see
it
though
for
i
cannot
think
of
a
better
example
of
the
style
drinkability
it
was
oaky
and
sour
like
the
stlye
should
be
but
unlike
some
this
one
wasnt
overwhelmingly
oaky
and
sour
it
was
more
oaky
then
sour
but
it
was
still
quite
nice
in
the
end
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
one
again
because
its
not
that
expensive
and
its
oaky
and
sour
like
a
good
flemish
sour
should
be
d
great
flavor
and
appearance
but
the
smell
and
especially
the
mouthfeel
leave
me
wanting
more
for
the
price
and
availability
a
great
pick
up
especially
as
an
introduction
to
sour
beers
for
someone
d
as
long
as
you
sip
this
beer
it
is
good
the
mouthfeel
is
disappointing
do
not
gulp
drinkability
if
you
like
the
style
you
will
probably
find
this
easy
to
drink
appearance
is
a
deep
amber
brown
color
with
a
nice
big
head
but
bubbles
that
are
too
big
and
dissolves
way
too
fast
very
limited
lacing
nose
is
strong
spicy
sourness
a
deeper
roasted
toffee
malt
aroma
as
well
definite
vinegar
hints
flavor
is
insane
crazy
strong
almost
a
barbecue
sauce
flavor
in
the
malty
sweetness
sourness
is
more
subdued
by
the
aforementioned
stronger
caramel
malt
sweetness
lots
of
dried
fruitiness
maybe
grape
in
particular
light
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
that
turns
quickly
vinous
body
feels
thicker
than
it
is
because
of
that
almost
chewy
malt
but
its
actual
light
to
medium
with
solid
carbonation
not
really
sure
what
to
say
about
this
one
its
interesting
and
unique
as
hell
although
that
might
just
be
my
inexperience
with
oud
bruins
its
an
experience
to
drink
although
im
not
sure
if
id
be
able
to
have
more
than
one
not
one
to
test
out
on
your
bmcdrinkin
buddies
mouthfeelgood
carbonation
delivers
a
very
tart
flavor
to
the
front
and
middle
palate
as
the
sourness
intensifies
down
the
sides
musty
wine
like
flavors
emerge
with
a
vigorous
froth
sour
from
beginning
to
end
i
liked
this
for
a
onetime
sipper
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
dark
maroon
color
with
an
offwhite
head
smell
is
mild
cherry
kriek
like
tartness
but
a
bit
too
mild
taste
is
like
a
thin
kriek
with
very
light
tartness
and
sweetness
thin
body
and
carbonation
just
not
enough
flavor
or
umpf
drinkability
im
definitely
not
a
sour
ale
kind
of
guy
but
this
one
isnt
as
sour
as
i
was
expecting
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
very
crisp
and
clean
without
the
whole
dirty
yeast
must
that
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
refreshing
brew
that
should
be
tried
if
given
the
opportunity
as
for
drinkability
i
cannot
believe
i
am
saying
this
but
i
wish
i
had
a
couple
more
of
these
laying
around
because
i
would
could
see
myself
having
one
a
week
it
is
an
interesting
beer
and
style
that
based
on
this
one
i
want
to
keep
exploring
not
what
i
expected
from
a
usmade
flanders
oud
bruin
it
was
surprising
well
done
with
a
nice
vinegary
smell
and
taste
it
poured
a
big
lacy
head
that
lasted
until
the
last
sip
it
had
a
typical
mouthfeel
for
a
oud
bruin
the
after
taste
lingered
with
a
fruity
sweet
and
sour
taste
it
was
worth
trying
it
out
it
finishes
with
rich
fruit
flavors
and
high
acidity
drinkablity
a
refreshing
brew
with
good
flavor
a
deep
brownish
red
carmel
colored
body
hosts
a
rocky
swiss
cheese
bubbled
foamy
head
head
has
nice
staying
power
and
leaves
spotty
scattered
lace
all
over
nose
is
a
very
funky
crisp
tartness
with
hints
of
cherry
rubarb
and
powder
candylike
pixie
sticks
a
musty
sour
funk
soaks
the
mouth
on
first
sip
the
tartness
is
really
much
more
mild
and
enjoyable
than
the
firsy
mouth
full
had
shown
the
sour
feel
dries
out
a
bit
and
actually
balances
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
that
same
dry
sour
hue
that
is
very
pleasant
drinkability
is
high
for
this
style
for
me
this
was
a
very
nice
change
from
some
of
the
blunt
mouth
destroyers
that
other
sour
beers
are
to
me
d
this
is
a
style
id
like
to
explore
further
i
enjoyed
my
first
quite
a
bit
bottle
poured
a
brownish
red
color
beer
with
a
medium
offwhite
foamy
head
with
some
pretty
good
retention
aroma
is
quite
sour
and
you
can
already
feel
the
effect
of
the
oak
on
this
beer
taste
is
quite
acid
with
some
subtle
sweetness
at
the
end
cheery
feels
is
less
present
then
in
the
rodenbach
grand
cru
but
can
still
be
detected
overall
i
find
this
one
to
be
a
good
flemish
sour
ale
and
would
even
say
that
it
seems
to
be
underrated
compared
to
some
other
flemish
sour
ale
mouthfeel
is
brightly
fizzy
yet
smooth
and
almost
creamy
as
well
taste
is
very
nicely
sweettart
cherries
steeped
in

the
sweetness
prevails
a
bit
as
the
bottle
is
finished
leaving
me
wishing
it
were
a
touch
drierknocks
drinkability
a
tad
nevertheless
a
wonderfully
refreshing
and
delicious
beer
drinkability
for
a
somewhat
sour
beer
this
is
way
drinkable
and
goes
very
well
with
steak
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
this
was
a
very
interesting
drinking
experience
and
makes
me
want
to
try
more
oud
bruins
drinkability
is
good
though
this
is
a
polarizing
style
this
brew
is
decently
drinkable
nice
complexity
and
proportioning
cheers
dont
drink
and
review
not
as
good
as
the
petrus
but
still
not
a
bad
sour
ale
d
unique
and
complex
the
slight
tartness
and
complex
after
taste
make
this
a
a
very
enjoyable
beer
id
definitely
have
another
drinkability
decent
taste
but
does
not
come
across
as
full
enough
to
enjoy
completely
worth
a
try
but
nothing
great
the
pour
was
a
dark
red
with
a
tanwhite
one
finger
head
the
initial
smell
was
of
berries
vinegar
and
cherries
the
taste
was
interesting
i
could
grab
the
sour
cherries
berries
and
i
even
think
i
picked
up
on
a
milky
feel
there
were
even
some
sweet
after
notes
that
followed
the
sour
taste
it
was
a
milky
sort
of
feel
in
the
mouth
and
the
sour
taste
got
my
palate
running
wild
it
was
a
slow
beer
to
drink
definitely
not
a
session
beer
if
you
dont
like
the
taste
it
will
be
hard
to
finish
just
man
up
not
bad
but
it
just
tastes
rather
onedimensional
especially
compared
to
other
similar
beers
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sourvinegar
scent
wrapped
around
a
malt
base
of
pale
crystal
and
roasted
malts
it
has
a
buttery
malt
aroma
very
nice
the
taste
is
really
good
it
has
a
smooth
and
refreshing
sourness
along
with
a
buttery
malt
flavor
the
crystal
and
roasted
malts
give
the
beer
excellent
malt
character
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
was
a
real
treat
im
a
fan
of
sour
beers
and
this
was
a
good
one
very
tasty
ive
always
loved
things
that
taste
sour
i
could
have
a
lot
more
of
this
its
not
too
strong
bottom
line
is
if
you
come
across
this
beer
its
most
definitely
worth
a
shot
i
only
had
to
pay
2
50
for
it
but
i
would
spend
more
than
that
definitely
give
this
a
shot
but
there
are
better
takes
poured
into
my
tulip
glass
with
a
fairly
menacing
looking
brownishamber
color
that
is
topped
off
by
a
long
lasting
albeit
extremely
thin
cappuccino
frothy
head
the
nose
brings
out
subtle
malted
vinegar
and
tart
apple
aromas
that
only
a
flanders
beer
can
the
taste
is
so
wonderfully
complex
sweet
malty
tones
with
apple
cider
trail
off
into
a
tart
mildly
acidic
finish
the
mouth
feel
of
this
ale
as
ive
been
finding
out
is
indicative
of
the
remarkably
refreshing
light
to
medium
body
these
beers
all
have
a
great
beer
with
grilled
steak
au
poivre
or
with
some
brie
de
meaux
and
crusty
french
bread
enjoy
d
i
think
this
ale
holds
well
to
the
duchesse
a
bit
more
dry
and
acidic
wellbalanced
and
unique
sour
beer
that
is
a
nice
break
from
some
of
the
bolder
styles
out
there
id
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
youre
into
sour
md
i
love
this
style
however
you
have
to
like
sourish
beers
to
enjoy
it
it
is
a
great
beer
rich
in
flavor
and
in
body
this
beer
feels
as
good
as
it
tastes
overall
i
consider
this
a
very
accessible
beer
within
the
style
i
dont
often
bring
sour
beers
through
my
fridge
but
this
one
is
certainly
one
id
consider

a
slight

seems
to
be
a
touch
of
cherries

off
fairly
mild

moved
to
a
cherry
sugary

kind

good
level

hitting
my

drinkable
yes
the
more
and
more
i
have
of
this
style
the
more
and
more
i
like
it
and
this
one
has
helped
to
further
my
appreciation
smell
was
very
vinuous
then
vinegar
personally
i
dont
find
the
smell
attractive
but
it
is
certainly
not
inappropriate
for
the
style
and
seems
to
be
well
done
taste
is
more
appealing
to
me
very
wine
like
and
cidery
reminds
me
a
lot
of
duchesse
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
light
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
here
isnt
hampered
by
the
beer
per
seit
is
a
good
beer
and
the
elements
seem
to
be
in
a
pretty
good
balance
here
however
this
is
a
style
that
perhaps
isnt
for
me
pick
it
up
if
you
are
interested
in
the
style
but
i
would
probably
recommend
duchesse
instead
slightly
hazy
cherry
reddish
with
a
tan
i
think
it
was
pretty
dark
in
the
bar
head
that
had
okay
retention
and
lace
smelled
like
a
sour
flemish
style
should
vinous
slightly
cideryvinegary
tart
hint
of
cherry
taste
was
even
better
than
nose
a
lot
mellower
than
duchesse
but
really
lovely
pretty
light
mouthfeel
and
properly
carbonated
great
after
dinner
but
not
a
session
drink
for
sure
overall
i
couldnt
shake
the
feeling
that
i
was
drinking
wine
with
more
carbonation
very
interesting
beer
pick
it
up
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different

flanders
red
on

at
the
stone
bistro
served
in
a
small
snifter
poured
a
brownish
red
with
a
head
that
had
receded
pretty
fast
into
a
thin
foam
aroma
had
a
faintly
tart
character
with
red
grapes
thrown
in
taste
had
a
maltiness
that
contained
a
bit
of
sour
but
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
from
darker
malt
to
balance
it
out
a
grape
taste
was
apparent
as
well
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
while
also
carbonated
enough
to
give
what
little
tartness
was
there
a
nice
quenching
aspect
this
is
a
malty
mild
sour
ale
that
goes
down
pretty
easy
very
enjoyable
and
will
definitely
purchase
this
again
not
bad
for
a
change
of
pace
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
aboveaverage
for
the
style
d
all
in
all
for
the
style
this
is
a
quite
drinkable
beer
in
the
sense
that
it
doesnt
really
overpower
but
definitely
provides
enough
sour
flavor
to
give
the
palate
a
kick
not
as
dialed
up
as
others
which
is
nice
but
the
body
seemed
a
bit
too
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
d
pretty
good
not
the
best
flemish
sour
but
worth
a
try
drinkability
i
couldnt
take
more
than
one
of
these
one
is
more
than
enough
not
my
favorite
flanders
style
d
this
is
a
great
flemish
sour
very
tasty
id
recommend
it
if
you
like
the
style
ken
likes
it
pleases
him
very
tasty
beverage
however
i
dont
think
i
could
consume
a
lot
in
a
sitting
now
i
love
sour
beers
i
had
3
today
but
one
of
these
is
enough
still
very
good
and
recommended
pouts
a
deep
red
with
approximately
a
one
inch
reddishbrown
head
head
dissipates
after
a
few
minutes
smells
sour
almost
candylike
first
sip
is
like
a
kick
in
the
face
extremely
sour
almost
like
a
sweet
tart
after
the
initial
shock
the
beer
goes
down
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
much
tingling
the
sour
taste
remains
in
the
mouth
and
even
the
throat
for
a
long
time
after
each
sip
however
it
somehow
adds
to
the
beers
refreshing
taste
i
will
continue
to
drink
this
beer
when
i
come
inside
from
a
hot
day
seeing
how
much
i
paid
for
the
beer
i
wont
be
trying
this
again
i
would
walk
a
mile
for
a
monk
d
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
the
label
would
have
you
believe
but
i
am
becoming
a
fan
of
this
style
a
complex
and
interesting
brew
that
is
far
outside
most
peoples
definition
of
how
a
beer
should
taste
abv
not
a
factor
worth
a
try
and
perhaps
a
repeat
my
mouth
tingles
slightly
with
the
sour
after
every
swallow
not
a
beer
to
chug
all
afternoon
but
very
tasty
d
wonderfully
light
on
the
palate
and
stomach
a
great
beer
to
introduce
others
to
sour
ales
great
for
a
hot
day
in
the
baby
pool
d
a
tasty
flanders
red
ale
an
eminently
drinkable
example
of
a
style
i
enjoy
alot
well
blended
good
aromas
and
flavors
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
and
would
like
more
of
thanks
to
jef
and
the
guys
at
van
steenberge
for
making
this
and
thanks
to
the
east
coaster
who
sent
this
bottle
d
easily
drinkable
and
enjoyable
appropriately
lightbodied
and
rather
mild
but
tasty
for
the
style
this
is
an
easy
drinker
it
isnt
as
sour
as
other
classic
examples
but
has
a
nicely
balanced
sourness
to
it
and
could
be
a
good
intro
to
the
style
a
nicely
done
brew
could
pair
well
with
grapes
and
creamy
cheeses
i
think
the
drinkability
is
great
i
am
a
big
fan
of
sour
beer
keep
that
in
mind
to
the
faint
of
heart
stay
away
served
as
a
good
accompaniment
to
pommes
frites
with
spiced
mayonnaise
a
simpler
sour
ale
than
some
of
the
others
ive
tried
but
at
the
same
time
its
the
most
drinkable
ive
had
it
comes
off
with
a
juicy
tart
sourness
that
tastes
slightly
like
sour
cherries
but
not
much
else
the
flavor
here
is
a
little
mellow
and
relies
mostly
on
the
sour
tang
to
carry
the
beer
ive
call
it
a
startersour
ale
certainly
not
the
best
in
the
business
but
nonetheless
a
pleasure
drinkability
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
not
the
typical
rodenbachlike
reds
worth
finding
really
worth
sampling
if
you
visit
monks
ontap
spicy
carbonation
that
remains
active
the
sourness
and
dryness
make
you
chave
more
extremely
refreshing
and
drinkable
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
its
kind
puts
duchesse
to
shame
making
her
seem
like
pure
vinegar
seek
and
consume
plenty
of
places
have
proprietary
beers
but
few
have
such
distinctive
entertaining
ales
its
a
sour
for
a
newer
palate
or
for
those
whod
like
a
little
less
horsiness
in
their
beer
for
whatever
the
reason
its
a
refreshing
and
willing
counterpoint
to
any
number
of
savory
culinary
choices
i
dont
usually
drink
it
at
monks
due
to
the
usually
many
untried
options
but
its
nice
to
be
able
to
bring
a
bit
of
monks
home
with
me
fairly
drinkable
but
its
not
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
poured
out
a
hazy
brown
with
red
tints
and
a
small
but
nice
head
nose
is
very
gentle
with
just
a
slight
sweetness
even
on
warming
it
stays
mild
taste
is
great
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
flavor
a
bit
lemony
corn
and
some
malt
sweetness
nice
balance
mouthfeel
is
tart
and
foamy
compliments
the
flavor
well
drinkability
is
good
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
sunset
grill
in
allston
ma
december
2007
this
is
a
very
nice
ale
on
tap
actually
much
fresher
more
refreshing
and
eminently
more
sippable
than
what
i
experienced
out
of
the
bottle
i
would
add
another
full
point
to
this
beer
on
tap
i
love
this
beer
my
first
flemish
sour
it
was
a
gateway
beer
to
the
style
leading
me
to
all
kinds
of
duchesse
not
a
fan
and
cantillons
yet
i
always
go
back
to
monks
it
has
all
the
tartness
and
acidity
without
the
overly
sweetness
that
can
come
with
the
style
really
im
just
writing
this
review
as
a
public
forum
for
anyone
whos
spotted
it
in
nycbrooklyn
please
let
me
know
if
youve
boughtdrank
it
in
the
area
i
miss
the
monks
drinkability
is
not
high
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
a
sipper
maybe
even
a
transitional
beer
would
be
nice
to
have
before
or
after
some
sweeter
reds
but
2
of
these
is
a
row
would
be
a
bit
much
very
weak
flavors
and
laid
back
balance
is
non
existent
and
just
a
wretched
lack
of
depth
hints
of
strawberry
and
raspberry
bitterness
is
mild
and
really
hurt
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
weak
and
there
is
virtually
no
length
to
the
finish
overall
not
bad
but
not
as
sour
as
i
was
hoping
or
as
the
aroma
would
lead
me
to
believe
the
finish
was
not
very
good
which
hurts
the
drinkability
this
may
be
a
good
nonintimidating
intro
into
sour
beers
but
not
at
the
top
of
the
list
for
me
drinkability
is
good
enough
as
the
beer
i
pleasantly
refreshing
though
not
hugely
complex
this
is
a
nice
tasting
flemish
sour
that
does
nicely
if
youre
in
a
pinch
for
a
sour
beer
fix
delicious
beer
but
one
or
two
is
plenty
atago
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
more
examples
of
the
style
drinkability
not
as
complex
as
some
other
flemish
reds
this
is
nonetheless
very
enjoyable
particularly
for
those
who
are
not
enamored
by
sour
beers
but
like
an
occasional
stroll
on
the
sour
side
while
theres
always
something
wonderful
to
be
said
about
monks
cafe
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
was
a
little
bit
of
a
bummer
the
beer
looks
beautiful
it
pours
a
wonderfully
bright
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
fluffy
pale
khaki
head
it
smells
sweet
and
wild
and
yeasty
a
bit
of
fruityness
can
be
detected
here
id
say
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
the
taste
starts
out
really
sweet
and
tart
almost
gummi
bearish
obviously
not
as
sweet
as
that
but
a
little
too
sweet
in
my
mind
for
a
flemmish
sour
theres
a
decent
bit
of
sourness
and
a
hint
of
wood
that
appears
after
that
first
blast
of
sweet
and
tart
changes
into
a
wild
and
funky
aftertaste
if
you
dont
go
for
another
sip
too
soon
the
mouthfeel
is
very
refreshing
with
its
scrubby
spritzy
carbonation
i
must
say
though
this
isnt
highly
drinkable
due
to
its
level
of
sweetness
again
i
was
a
little
bummed
d
surprisingly
for
a
sour
ale
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
mildness
compared
to
other
sour
ales
ive
sampled
makes
this
the
most
drinkable
example
of
the
style
i
can
think
of
d
very
drinkable
beer
as
a
flemish
red
should
be
less
acidity
than
some
examples
of
this
style
which
makes
it
less
intense
and
easier
to
drink
but
it
is
also
not
as
complex
as
something
like
rodenbach
this
is
only
my
second
sour
ale
the
first
was
awhile
back
and
i
couldnt
take
it
i
figured
id
give
another
sour
a
shot
and
this
was
a
pretty
refreshing
drink
a
lot
different
than
what
i
remembered
from
my
last
expierence
im
looking
forward
to
trying
different
sours
in
the
future
12
oz
bottle
with
my
belvoved
manic
street
preachers
design
for
life
on
the
hifi
poured
into
my
stella
artois
glass
this
was
a
call
from
dan
at
martys
i
enjoy
talkiing
to
dan
about
beer
and
his
call
on
the
avery
hog
heaven
was
very
good
but
this
was
not
i
guess
sour
is
not
my
style
color
was
a
dark
red
burgundy
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
did
not
last
long
cider
sour
apples
and
cherries
tasing
this
is
not
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
but
the
flavor
is
everywhere
and
the
finish
is
bleh
it
was
not
overly
sour
that
turn
me
off
but
it
was
a
tad
watery
and
the
flavors
again
are
everywhere
really
had
to
fight
it
to
get
it
down
not
a
drain
pour
but
close
cloudy
brown
apple
cider
look
very
little
head
nothing
appealing
about
the
look
at
all
smell
is
all
sour
fruit
this
is
what
i
was
expecting
cherry
notes
and
maybe
its
just
the
apple
cider
appearance
but
i
think
i
pick
up
notes
of
sour
apple
too
taste
is
sour
but
not
completely
mouthpuckering
sour
its
an
interesting
taste
for
sure
but
not
over
the
top
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
this
one
too
style
wise
but
this
is
pretty
much
what
i
expected
other
than
the
rather
drab
appearance
a
beer
that
is
worth
a
try
single
bottle
purchased
at
city
wide
in
mishawaka
a
very
pretty
beer
in
my
tulip
glass
perfect
look
to
it
all
clear
and
devilishly
red
with
a
fancy
soft
head
and
great
looking
lacing
stinks
like
cranberries
sour
cherries
and
red
wine
lots
of
odor
to
it
inviting
taste
is
tart
but
surprizing
in
that
its
really
not
all
that
complex
dry
cherry
flavor
biscuity
malt
and
vague
cranberries
and
they
all
fade
rather
fast
its
a
lot
softer
and
less
aggressive
than
i
imagined
it
would
be
from
the
nose
alcohol
is
almost
imperceptible
its
a
nice
beer
overall
but
its
not
i
think
the
best
of
its
kind
overall
this
beer
was
good
but
then
i
usually
enjoy
anything
from
this
style
drinkability
this
is
my
first
red
ale
i
have
been
dying
to
try
one
for
a
long
time
i
was
worried
it
may
be
too
sour
the
kind
of
drink
you
couldnt
really
stand
to
have
too
many
of
however
this
is
not
the
case
this
is
a
tart
and
crisp
refreshing
drink
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
more
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
effervescent
nice
my
first
experience
with
this
style
is
definitely
a
good
one
and
i
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
while
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
still
a
very
drinkable
flemish
ale
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
god
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
sour
ales
and
this
one
is
really
reserved
for
this
category
i
would
drink
it
again
but
mostly
with
newbies
to
sour
beers
poured
from
the
12oz
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
body
is
a
turbid
brown
hue
with
ruby
red
highlights
topped
by
a
modest
offwhite
head
tangy
aroma
that
is
typical
of
a
flemish
sour
tart
cherries
belgian
malt
some
light
floral
euro
hops
and
a
decent
bit
of
astringency
palate
is
along
the
same
lines
with
tart
sour
cherry
dominating
up
front
becoming
more
balanced
with
the
light
brown
malt
by
midpalate
finish
is
again
tart
with
a
light
flash
of
hoppiness
before
the
swallow
the
astringency
doesnt
linger
as
long
as
some
other
sours
but
definitely
makes
its
presence
known
body
is
a
light
and
spritzy
maybe
a
touch
foamy
at
times
be
gentle
with
this
one
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
sour
ales
but
this
one
is
passable
muddy
brown
with
some
minor
reddish
highlights
nice
fruity
aroma
with
a
touch
of
sourness
to
it
very
berry
like
smell
to
it
moderately
sour
flavor
a
slight
hint
of
fruit
to
it
finishes
quite
dry
good
mouthfeelvery
bright
an
effervescent
on
the
palate
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
i
knock
it
down
a
bit
for
drinkability
as
it
gets
to
be
too
much
for
me
after
1
or
2
dont
let
that
stop
you
pours
a
very
murky
brown
with
ruby
highlights
not
much
head
the
smell
is
malt
vinegar
and
late
sweet
malt
tastes
quite
sour
with
a
spicy
taste
redolent
of
cinnamon
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
alittle
rough
and
nonintegrated
for
me
but
its
a
quite
refreshing
brew
the
smell
is
a
bit
winelike
it
actually
smells
sour
there
is
also
a
damp
basement
smell
present
as
well
like
youd
find
with
a
gueuze
or
a
saison
having
never
had
this
style
before
i
am
unsure
what
this
should
be
like
but
my
suspicion
is
that
this
is
right
on
target
for
the
style
taste
is
tart
and
sour
all
the
way
through
no
bitterness
or
anything
else
pure
lippuckering
tartness
i
like
this
very
much
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
pleasant
with
a
lower
level
of
co2
quite
drinkable
im
fairly
impressed
with
this
one
and
certainly
glad
i
tried
it
ill
probably
buy
this
again
oelergud
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
with
a
coded
date
on
label
had
a
decent
head
that
eventually
become
a
thin
constant
film
that
also
left
lacing
throughout
was
a
medium
mahogany
color
the
smell
was
strong
with
the
sour
cherries
and
definitely
let
you
knew
what
was
coming
the
mouthfeel
was
good
this
was
my
first
sour
ale
so
a
whole
new
experience
overall
id
say
i
liked
it
but
not
sure
im
in
a
rush
to
get
another
one
right
away
this
style
for
me
is
probably
something
to
try
every
so
often
and
see
if
i
grow
into
it
id
recommend
trying
this
beer
as
it
is
top
10
in
the
style
so
a
good
intro
to
it
3
5
rb
t
y
mouthfeel
is
my
only
complaint
a
bit
flat
for
my
tastes
overall
though
one
of
my
new
favorite
beers
i
hope
i
can
get
this
in
lancaster
planning
on
buying
a
case
i
can
drink
this
happily
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
also
one
of
the
rarest
for
me
to
get
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
i
have
had
it
on
tap
once
or
twice
at
a
few
local
socal
spots
that
might
have
this
type
of
beer
lucky
baldwins
obriens
and
really
enjoyed
it
on
tap
it
was
a
while
ago
so
i
cant
compare
directly
here
recommended
an
enjoyable
beer
though
not
nearly
as
complex
as
say
duchesse
its
probably
a
better
thirstquencher
though
certainly
one
to
try
especially
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
recommended
reddish
brown
with
almost
no
head
cherry
aroma
well
malted
more
so
and
less
yeasty
than
the
brewerys
own
version
of
the
flemish
sour
sour
it
makes
its
point
and
its
not
overdone
there
is
some
balance
had
a
bottle
again
6
5
years
later
and
its
got
some
cherry
but
in
fact
a
stouty
aroma
just
ok
and
rerated
somewhat
creamy
on
the
tongue
a
drinkable
brew
but
i
almost
expect
this
style
to
be
a
bit
mroe
assertive
pours
a
hazy
redorange
thick
tan
head
forms
nice
lacing
great
retention
really
sticky
smell
is
sweet
and
sour
sugary
some
caramel
some
fruits
excellent
funk
taste
is
sour
some
cherries
funky
fruits
nice
toffee
finish
more
sourness
as
it
goes
down
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
nice
flanders
ale
thanks
drjay
drinkability
is
excellent
this
example
is
nicely
balanced
for
the
novice
but
a
little
too
restrained
for
the
fan
a
great
sessionable
flanders
red
low
to
medium
bodied
a
refreshing
lightly
sour
beer
d
first
one
of
this
style
dont
think
im
a
huge
fan
of
it
but
it
is
good
i
would
probably
keep
one
of
these
if
i
could
get
it
just
for
those
occasions
when
it
would
sound
great
drinkability
is
good
an
interesting
beer
notes
i
liked
it
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
blending
old
and
young
beers
when
done
right
is
awesome
this
one
is
not
in
the
elite
category
to
me
but
more
of
a
nice
representation
that
stays
in
the
safe
zone
poured
to
a
murky
brown
with
okay
head
but
little
lacing
aroma
was
the
usual
vinegary
smell
but
nothing
else
seemed
present
flavor
was
extra
sour
and
while
i
detected
a
hint
of
fruit
it
was
difficult
to
really
tell
what
it
was
other
flemish
sours
tend
to
be
sour
then
slide
into
a
sweet
aftertaste
this
hits
you
with
very
sour
start
and
then
sweet
with
little
transition
it
also
tended
to
be
a
little
watery
i
really
have
learned
to
like
flemish
sours
but
this
one
while
good
was
not
one
of
the
best
overall
a
very
drinkable
flanders
red
ale
not
too
over
the
top
with
tartness
puckery
lemon
sodalike
sour
apple
granny
smith
apple
juice
a
slight
bit
of
grain
i
like
it
finally
got
down
to
the
blue
nile
to
have
a
draft
of
monks
flemish
red
and
it
was
really
worth
the
trip
i
had
a
draft
at
monks
a
year
ago
and
rated
this
one
higher
for
this
tasting
the
beer
poured
high
with
a
thick
off
white
head
with
lots
of
small
carbonation
bubbles
which
drops
to
a
thin
lingering
foam
that
resembles
a
tan
oil
slick
only
a
small
amount
of
lace
hangs
on
the
edge
it
is
a
truly
red
red
ale
dark
cherry
in
color
with
golden
highlights
that
almost
shimmers
sour
fruit
fills
your
nose
mostly
cherry
but
also
raisinscurrants
along
with
a
light
tinge
from
the
oak
too
the
smell
is
less
complex
than
the
soursweettartsour
tastelike
those
expensive
dark
cherries
you
let
set
an
extra
day
or
two
in
the
fridge
before
eating
the
malt
sweetness
is
strong
enough
to
try
hard
to
balance
but
in
the
end
lose
by
a
bit
to
the
complex
yeasty
sourness
perfect
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
had
to
head
home
after
two
because
a
third
would
have
knocked
me
for
a
loop
hope
that
my
life
allows
me
to
get
back
for
another
draft
of
this
very
cool
beer
of
an
underdone
style
take
my
review
for
what
it
isi
switch
back
and
forth
between
barleywine
and
flanders
red
as
my
favorite
stylesi
like
strong
sour
and
in
your
face
beers
that
have
strong
opposing
flavors
fans
of
flemish
sours
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
theyre
a
rabid
bunch
but
i
know
thisll
please

oz

pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
body
with
a
small
khaki
head
good
retention
and
some
patchy
island
chain
lacing
aroma
features
light
malt
and
lots
of
acidic
notes
of
sour
white
grapes
and
cherries
mouthfeel
is
tart
and
effervescent
light
bodied
taste
is
dry
and
tart
hints
of
cherries
and
sour
white
grapes
a
hint
of
caramel
supports
the
considerable
acidic
sourness
clean
and
refreshing
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
extremly
drinkable
to
me
and
i
would
love
to
enjoy
it
more
often
but
i
had
to
fly
to
la
to
get
it
so
i
wount
be
enjoying
it
for
a
few
more
months
what
a
good
beer
very
similar
to
rodenbach
red
nothing
like
a
good
flemish
ale
to
wake
up
the
palate
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
sour
but
very
drinkable
it
ends
up
sweetening
up
after
a
while
and
it
does
not
sour
your
stomach
regardless
the
sour
is
taste
only
on
the
palate
and
is
quite
enjoyable
to
me
it
is
absolutely
superb
with
a
rich
creamy
cheese
like
brie
camembert
saga
blue
or
st
andre
it
is
a
quientessential
belgian
beer
in
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
and
anyone
experienced
with
belgians
will
note
the
familiar
characteristics
excellent
and
very
unique
beer
a
good
easy
drinker
so
much
that
my
girlfriend
stole
it
could
be
more
complex
perhaps
but
is
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
along
with
the
drinkability
is
cordial
it
is
light
enough
that
it
might
be
a
refreshing
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
pours
a
dark
red
with
purple
hues
minimal
head
which
quickly
dissipates
smell
is
slightly
vinegar
and
sour
with
some
sweetness
taste
is
sour
vinegarlike
with
some
mild
sweetness
in
the
finish
mostly
cherrylike
very
light
and
refreshing
on
the
palate
easy
to
drink
particularly
for
a
red
ale
worth
a
try
my
tolerance
for
the
sour
and
tart
is
not
high
in
a
beer
but
the
flavor
was
not
bad
not
sure
if
i
am
a
flemish
sour
ale
guy
i
will
have
to
try
more
to
see
drinkability
im
having
a
hard
time
finishing
a
12oz
bottle
would
i
drink
it
again
i
could
get
two
of
bells
expedition
for
the
price
of
this
bottle
or
half
of
cantillons
organic
gueze
nuf
said
murky
deep
cordovan
with
ox
blood
highlights
pillowy
soft
tan
head
of
mixed
size
bubbles
that
crackles
as
it
slowly
settles
leaving
a
few
splotches
of
lace
fat
carbonation
bubbles
stick
to
the
glass
but
do
not
move
the
aroma
is
mildly
tart
with
woody
tones
and
a
modest
dose
of
balsamic
vinegar
there
is
a
minimal
amount
of
funkiness
that
works
with
the
sugar
sweet
aromas
initially
tart
and
lactic
acidic
but
not
overly
so
there
is
a
woody
tone
that
surfaces
in
the
middle
a
sweetness
arrives
to
provide
a
bit
of
balance
but
the
finish
is
dominated
by
the
acidic
edge
that
pulls
at
the
back
corners
and
lingers
there
is
a
tannic
component
as
well
as
a
clearly
vinegar
think
thin
balsamic
tone
mediumlight
body
the
carbonation
is
bountiful
and
the
acidic
flavors
seems
to
add
lightness
while
also
leaving
the
mouth
fairly
clean
tasty
and
the
acidic
nature
makes
this
thirst
quenching
perhaps
not
sessionable
but
definitely
worthy
of
returning
to
over
time
overall
i
have
not
seen
this
one
on
the
west
coast
before
so
when
i
spied
this
lone
bottle
on
the
shelves
at
hitimes
in
costa
mesa
i
snapped
up
the
chance
to
try
it
again
hmmmm
nice
enough
but
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
think
that
the
draft
version
is
much
better
the
bottle
just
seems
to
lacks
balls
cheers
d
this
is
a
sour
ale
i
could
enjoy
year
round
nice
on
the
porch
on
a
warm
day
this
is
my
first
time
drinking
a
sour
tasting
beer
and
i
am
extrememly
surprised
truly
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
a
great
experience
for
me
this
was
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
for
me
ruby
red
with
a
bit
of
a
brown
hue
and
quite
clear
the
fine
light
beige
head
showed
good
retention
and
produced
a
solid
sheet
of
lace
on
the
glass
malt
sweetness
and
sour
fruit
cherries
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
hint
of
leather
tart
berry
fruitiness
balanced
the
moderate
malt
quite
nicely
some
sour
cherry
as
well
also
earthy
and
woody
it
finished
with
lingering
raspberry
tartness
light
bodied
with
some
residual
sugar
that
gave
it
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
very
thirst
quenching
and
highly
drinkable
even
with
the
rest
of
the
lineup
at
monks
cafe
i
had
to
have
a
second
glass
before
moving
on
the
taste
to
me
was
a
little
bland
sure
theres
a
bit
of
sour
in
there
and
maybe
a
little
oaky
fruit
tone
but
overall
seemed
a
little
weak
to
me
there
is
also
of
course
a
bit
of
acidity
to
the
mouthfeel
but
this
quickly
disappears
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
a
newcomers
sour
ale
since
it
doesnt
seem
to
really
catch
all
of
what
a
belgian
red
can
encompas
its
still
an
ok
brew
though
im
rating
the
smell
and
taste
down
a
little
since
this
kind
of
beer
really
should
be
more
powerful
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
slightly
lighter
body
than
i
prefer
the
carbonation
at
times
can
be
burning
and
stinging
the
beer
is
still
pretty
dam
refreshing
to
drink
this
is
a
pretty
solid
offering
by
any
standard
d
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
its
ok
and
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
id
be
compelled
to
try
again
oh
well
they
cant
all
be
rodenbach
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
but
the
rodenbbach
qualites
are
still
there
not
quite
mouth
puckering
but
decent
very
easy
to
drink
when
i
had
it
on
tap
i
could
imagine
drinking
this
all
night
very
light
and
refreshing
a
good
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
a
great
way
to
kick
off
the
evening
a
highly
drinkable
brew
and
a
very
interesting
one
at
that
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
every
night
but
good
for
a
change
once
in
a
while
full
ruby
red
color
with
a
decent
light
beige
head
and
moderate
carbonation
definite
sourness
in
the
aroma
but
overall
a
nicely
balanced
sweet
and
sour
flanders
red
ale
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
fairly
mild
overall
for
the
style
and
therefore
makes
it
a
very
approachable
introduction
for
newcomers
medium
bodied
and
refreshing
without
being
overly
sour
looking
forward
to
tasting
the
bottled
version
but
it
seems
from
previous
reviews
that
it
may
not
be
quite
as
good
11
2
ounce
bottle
pours
out
a
murky
reddish
brown
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
sour
cherries
and
oak
the
flavor
is
a
tangy
mixture
of
sweet
and
sour
the
flavor
of
cherries
is
most
prominent
but
there
is
also
oak
wine
and
berries
there
is
enough
sourness
so
that
the
sweetness
is
held
in
check
but
i
would
like
this
better
if
it
was
less
sweet
finishes
very
acidic
carbonation
is
high
this
is
a
pretty
good
version
no
matter
how
much
i
enjoy
a
good
flanders
red
im
perfectly
content
to
go
weeks
or
even
months
between
bottles
since
my
tolerance
for
sour
is
a
fraction
of
my
tolerance
for
bitter
monks
cafe
flemish
sour
red
is
an
excellent
version
though
if
im
ever
in
philadelphia
ill
make
it
a
point
to
stop
in
at
monks
for
a
glass
what
the
hell
maybe
two
drinkability
is
rather
high
because
this
really
has
become
my
end
of
the
night
beer
drinkability
i
had
12
of
the
bottle
and
poured
it
down
the
drain
this
ale
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
rodenbach
sour
sweet
and
sour
citrus
to
start
moving
into
an
almost
chemical
candy
sour
middle
ending
on
a
more
dry
sourness
like
a
sour
wine
im
no
good
at
picking
out
different
types
of
sours
my
pallete
isnt
used
to
them
alls
i
can
say
is
that
this
is
sour
and
its
good
pours
as
brown
as
brown
can
be
with
dirty
white
lacing
wonderfully
sharp
sourtart
aroma
reminiscent
of
fantome
hiver
taste
is
big
sourness
and
tartness
grape
skins
tannins
and
oak
light
but
lively
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
i
could
guzzle
this
stuff
very
enjoyable
and
not
too
expensive
at
3
bucks
a
bottle
hazy
ruby
topped
off
with
a
thick
antique
white
head
pleasantly
tart
aroma
with
a
solid
caramel
malt
base
a
bit
woody
and
vinous
understated
and
classy
the
flavor
opens
with
caramel
malt
and
an
immediate
modest
tartness
red
grape
juice
with
a
bit
of
plum
easing
simply
into
a
tart
berrylike
finish
fizzy
with
a
lighter
medium
body
and
plenty
of
dryness
in
the
finish
good
stuff
very
drinkable
solid
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
pours
out
a
bubbly
dark
cherry
red
with
about
a
half
inch
of
tan
foam
on
top
nice
sour
aroma
with
light
woody
notes
and
faint
fruits
some
sweetness
is
there
in
the
back
nice
little
sour
kick
upfront
in
the
flavor
with
some
balancing
notes
from
sweet
fruits
light
woody
notes
as
this
finishes
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
really
easy
drinking
while
this
was
good
and
balanced
i
usually
prefer
a
bit
more
sourness
in
this
style
thanks
bditty187
drinkability
was
quite
good
not
too
expensive
good
bosy
nice
taste
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
that
type
of
beer
experience
yes
i
would
revisit
this
one
readily
if
the
store
i
got
it
at
had
more
than
the
one
bottle
i
dont
think
i
like
the
sour
ales
as
much
but
i
would
probably
give
this
beer
another
chance
d
this
is
a
flemish
sour
but
it
doesnt
have
any
of
the
big
characteristics
that
i
associate
with
this
style
this
is
a
beer
if
you
want
to
stick
your
toe
in
the
pool
of
sour
beers
i
prefer
to
jump
right
in
with
the
sour
beers
that
real
make
you
pucker
and
smell
like
you
are
on
a
farm
in
the
summer
this
is
very
smooth
with
just
a
hint
of
that
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
amberbrown
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
dies
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
lots
of
sour
fruitiness
cherry
mostly
the
flavor
is
quite
tart
but
not
puckering
tart
some
cherry
and
citrus
flavors
go
well
with
the
lactic
sourness
seems
to
also
have
some
woody
flavors
in
there
the
body
is
light
but
not
too
light
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
once
you
get
used
to
the
sourness
overall
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
of
the
flemish
red
style
i
have
tried
to
date
the
bottle
does
note
that
this
is
a
light
version
of
sourness
etc
but
being
a
fan
of
the
style
i
would
prefer
a
fullblown
sourpuss
beer
like
duchesse
de
borgoune
or
rodenbach
grand
cru
a
delightful
beer
but
not
as
clean
or
controlled
as
more
noted
beers
in
the
style
like
rodenbach
this
is
only
my
second
flemish
sour
ale
and
i
find
myself
really
enjoying
this
style
im
looking
forward
to
trying
some
more
i
am
not
sorry
i
tried
this
but
it
doesnt
hold
up
against
several
of
its
peers
like
an
old
lover
duchesse
was
my
first
and
remains
my
favorite
i
will
probably
keep
a
bottle
on
hand
in
the
cellar
but
it
wont
be
one
i
will
reach
for
on
a
weekly
basis
i
really
like
this
beer
i
think
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
like
it
even
more
because
i
purchased
it
in
council
bluffs
ia
for
only
2
50
a
bottle
i
cant
knock
that
what
a
find
it
is
plenty
drinkable
i
will
buy
more
and
you
should
too
thanks
uncle
flip
on

wonderful
cafe
in
philly
pours
the
expected
reddish
tone
respectable
lacing
emenating
from
a
tan
head
nose
is
sharply
sour
fruity
and
spicy
this
style
is
not
for
everyone
but
as
acompliment
to
tasty
rich
belgian
mussles
and
other
other
dishes
it
is
stunning
a
world
class
palate
cleanser
and
beer
to
enjoy
with
certain
foods
flavorful
and
wel
crafted
worth
acquiring
a
taste
for
this
sophisticated
nectar
a
very
fun
and
interesting
beer
to
drink
i
dont
know
how
many
of
these
you
would
want
to
have
in
a
sitting
though
perhaps
it
is
just
a
onetime
thing
other
than
the
stinky
scent
i
give
it
allthumbsup
a
nice
solid
sour
but
kind
of
a
low
end
attempt
the
apperance
was
redish
and
i
got
a
little
head
smells
of
feet
and
lactic
acid
covering
up
all
of
the
malt
the
taste
is
sour
but
not
overly
sour
and
is
kind
of
one
dimentional
with
the
malt
backbone
most
broken
it
was
also
pretty
thin
and
watery
but
it
could
be
a
nice
sipper
at
a
lower
price
but
i
think
i
would
rather
go
to
better
sour
ales
uf
overall
a
style
all
beer
lovers
should
try
at
least
once
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
minimal
sparse
head
over
top
with
no
real
carbonation
bubbling
up
clarity
is
excellent
nose
is
very
interesting
i
get
a
bit
of
cherries
and
tartness
but
it
is
also
moderately
grainy
its
lacking
that
good
acetate
blast
that
i
like
in
my
flanders
red
brews
it
is
also
pretty
unintense
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
is
a
little
better
initial
taste
is
a
very
sharp
almost
biting
tartness
this
moves
to
a
sour
cherry
with
a
moderate
acetate
flavors
are
just
a
bit
thin
for
what
i
like
its
not
really
grabbing
my
senses
as
other
have
feel
is
on
the
thin
end
of
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
of
tiny
bubbles
this
is
an
okay
brew
nothing
really
makes
it
pop
as
a
stellar
example
id
like
a
fuller
flavor
on
this
seems
just
a
touch
watery
while
i
like
this
beer
in
small
doses
drinking
too
much
of
it
gives
me
heartburn
and
i
dont
get
heartburn
off
of
anything
even
habanero
chilis
its
good
to
get
away
from
the
realm
of
regular
beer
from
time
to
time
and
this
beer
is
ideal
to
introduce
the
palate
to
even
funkier
beers
such
as
the
aforementioned
cantillon
my
first
experience
of
a
sour
ale
so
i
wasnt
too
sure
what
to
expect
i
must
say
though
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
it
did
have
a
nice
foamy
head
that
lasted
quite
a
while
but
then
deflated
into
a
thick
laceing
the
smell
was
nice
and
malty
with
a
sweetnsour
undertone
accompanied
by
a
light
grape
finish
taste
was
sour
from
the
moment
you
put
it
in
your
mouth
it
had
a
sour
start
with
a
tart
finish
i
really
dug
this
style
it
was
something
i
really
wanted
to
try
ever
since
i
first
saw
they
had
sour
brews
i
do
like
sour
foods
sauces
candy
liquor
and
such
so
this
one
is
up
my
alley
drinkability
one
of
the
better
flanders
i
have
had
i
like
the
fact
that
the
tartness
wasnt
too
overpowering
nice
drinking
brew
330
ml
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
a
redcopper
with
a
2
finger
head
that
is
tan
with
a
hint
of
red
and
forms
a
crater
in
the
middle
when
it
recedes
and
leaves
some
nice
foam
for
lace
it
smells
of
sour
grape
fruit
dung
lactic
i
guess
thats
what
it
is
its
not
familiar
to
me
and
they
mention
it
on
the
label
along
with
mustiness
and
some
acidity
it
tastes
souracidic
fruity
tart
with
medicinal
phenols
farmmustiness
and
perhaps
iron
and
salt
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
but
not
sure
if
they
use
them
it
has
a
light
tingly
dry
body
that
is
quite
refreshing
and
its
overall
a
quality
beer
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
nice
and
tart
with
some
fruity
tones
to
it
the
taste
continue
the
tart
theme
but
there
is
also
a
nice
sweet
balance
provided
by
the
fruity
tones
in
the
beer
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
and
i
have
found
myself
at
one
of
the
bars
at
monks
having
a
few
of
these
after
work
on
several
occasions
mdr
good
effervescence
and
medium
body
i
think
this
may
have
bordered
on
a
tad
of
dry
but
not
much
and
it
was
excellent
dark
translucent
red
with
medium
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
laces
the
glass
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
nose
of
mellow
aspirin
sourness
maybe
some
tart
fruit
too
starts
off
with
smooth
almost
watery
base
that
moves
into
a
tart
middle
that
doesnt
quite
last
long
enough
or
get
intensely
sour
slightly
disappointing
in
that
regard
mouthfeel
is
medium
the
finish
leans
toward
metallic
this
is
drinkable
because
the
sourness
doesnt
overpower
but
thats
why
i
buy
a
flemish
ale
this
isnt
as
bad
as
the
lindemans
gueuze
but
if
it
were
any
sweeter
it
would
be
pushing
it
drinkability
i
did
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
from
the
tap
at
monks
in
philadelphia
particularly
with
their
chickenandapple
sausage
sandwich
but
i
have
to
wonder
if
i
shouldnt
expect
more
complexity
from
a
sour
ale
the
sour
flavor
is
very
prevalent
and
i
would
likely
get
it
again
but
probably
not
often
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
most
peculiar
styles
in
my
opinion
and
one
of
the
most
novel
which
makes
me
want
to
seek
out
every
version
i
can
the
problem
is
they
always
seem
so
damn
hard
to
find
at
any
rate
ive
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
as
the
review
comes
to
a
close
and
i
still
have
a
little
less
than
half
of
the
bottle
left
in
my
class
it
was
about
2
75
for
the
bottle
and
to
me
thats
cheap
for
such
a
stab
at
such
a
crazy
and
deliciously
ambrosialike
style
cant
wait
to
snag
some
more
versions
when
i
can
actually
find
them
drinkability
i
really
enjoy
belgian
oud
bruins
and
flemish
reds
i
could
sip
on
a
few
of
these
but
eventually
the
acidic
tartness
will
catch
up
and
ill
want
something
to
scrub
the
palate
a
nice
saison
or
duvel
ok
as
the
style
goes
a
sweet
and
sour
ale
that
i
really
cant
pair
with
anything
except
sauerbraten
poured
a
slightly
transparent
deep
reddishbrown
with
big
carbonation
small
sheen
of
foam
and
good
lace
smells
big
and
fruity
a
sweet
and
sour
blend
of
green
apples
and
grapes
that
tickles
the
nose
green
apples
pears
and
a
counterbalance
of
wood
and
sweet
dark
fruits
cherries
lead
to
a
superdry
earthy
and
yeasty
finish
highlycarbonated
moderately
light
and
tingly
in
the
mouth
this
could
just
be
the
wine
lovers
beer
i
am
amazed
by
how
incredibly
redwine
it
is
the
sourness
of
the
beer
contributes
to
its
drinkability
tart
sour
and
just
a
little
sweetness
to
keep
everything
in
check
a
great
introduction
to
the
style
went
very
well
with
my
dinner
i
was
glad
i
chose
this
beer
because
i
forgot
to
pick
up
some
cranberry
sauce
truely
a
tough
beer
to
rate
i
dont
know
this
style
well
so
i
am
going
off
pure
taste
and
enjoyment
i
would
buy
this
or
order
this
again
anytime
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
examples
of
this
style
aromas
of
sour
cherries
and
brown
sugar
dense
oatmeal
colored
head
was
more
then
i
expected
sour
and
tart
flavors
dominate
but
in
an
interesting
mix
of
cherry
and
lime
once
those
flavors
release
my
tongue
there
are
some
other
strange
things
that
begin
to
happen
its
hard
to
put
my
finger
on
it
but
there
is
an
earthywoody
aspect
and
a
light
spicyness
that
i
cant
describe
pepper
and
vanilla
probably
not
anyway
its
enjoyable
and
interesting
light
highly
carbonated
beer
with
a
tart
and
dry
finish
i
was
expecting
a
less
carbonated
beer
that
was
all
tart
and
thankfully
it
was
more
then
that
notes
tart
sour
sweet
and
good
this
was
my
first
flanders
red
so
i
really
have
no
right
to
judge
it
i
just
know
i
enjoyed
it
maybe
ill
revisit
this
beer
review
after
i
get
more
experience
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
amberruby
color
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
tart
with
notes
of
sharp
cherry
caramel
tannic
wood
and
a
light
mustiness
the
aroma
is
pretty
interesting
i
am
definitely
looking
forward
to
the
taste
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
up
front
with
a
thin
body
the
taste
has
an
appealing
tartness
to
it
that
is
a
mix
of
a
sour
cherrylike
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
acetic
acid
the
taste
is
a
pretty
clean
mix
of
fruitiness
sourness
and
toffee
malt
notes
the
taste
is
just
a
bit
too
simplistic
and
thin
did
not
quite
live
up
to
the
aroma
certainly
drinkable
and
even
a
bit
enjoyable
poured
a
deep
redbrown
color
with
sparse
slightlyoff
white
head
smell
is
very
tart
and
fruity
taste
is
somewhat
of
a
shocker
extremely
tart
and
sour
enough
to
make
my
mouth
pucker
finish
is
more
tartness
had
trouble
finishing
half
a
bottle
not
my
style
of
beer
the
brown
murky
body
of
this
beer
was
topped
with
a
smallish
offwhite
head
giving
this
beer
quite
a
rough
hewn
look
not
unattractive
just
lacking
charisma
aromatically
this
was
very
interesting
with
a
vinegary
sour
smell
and
some
apple
cider
like
notes
the
taste
was
basically
replicating
fermented
apple
cider
with
a
puckering
tart
sourness
apple
skin
like
astringency
and
a
touch
of
spiciness
come
to
think
of
it
this
looks
a
lot
like
unfiltered
apple
juice
as
well
this
will
be
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
if
you
happen
to
like
the
taste
of
apple
cider
i
would
love
to
try
this
one
mulled
one
day
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
flemish
reds
but
what
i
have
experienced
of
the
style
i
love
so
im
trying
to
branch
out
a
bit
and
explore
picked
this
up
out
of
the
blue
beautiful
color
on
this
one
cabinet
brown
with
red
hues
but
really
no
head
at
all
reminiscent
of
a
gueuze
i
dont
particularly
know
if
this
style
is
supposed
to
have
a
decent
head
or
not
but
im
thinking
no
since
its
on
the
sour
side
smell
is
all
over
the
place
sour
cherry
comes
to
mind
first
with
other
sweeter
fruits
backing
it
up
taste
is
ok
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
from
the
smell
tart
but
not
overly
so
but
all
of
the
sweet
fruity
complexity
in
the
smell
is
absent
in
the
taste
a
little
watery
to
be
honest
im
not
one
of
those
guys
that
needs
their
taste
buds
destroyed
by
every
beer
at
all
but
this
tastes
a
little
bland
to
me
the
smell
is
making
me
crave
something
better
that
i
cant
get
in
the
taste
i
think
if
they
stepped
this
up
a
bit
a
little
more
sour
a
little
more
complex
it
would
be
great
not
a
bad
beer
drinkable
but
doesnt
hold
my
interest


this
sour
ale
went
down
ok
but
was
nothing
special
and
came
in
a
tad
under
par
for
this
prolific
belgian
brewery
pours
with
a
twofinger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
ring
leaving
no
lace
cloudy
amber
color

bodied
and

here

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
this
poured
with
a
great
thick
brownish
head
but
it
dissipated
all
too
quickly
leaving
behind
a
thin
wispy
reminder
the
color
is
a
deep
ruby
redbrown
the
nose
is
very
tart
with
an
underlying
smell
like
toast
right
from
the
toaster
it
has
a
thick
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
flavor
that
is
very
reminiscent
of
sweettarts
from
childhood
it
has
what
i
can
best
describe
as
a
candylike
sweetness
but
offsetbalanced
by
an
extremely
tart
flavor
the
finish
reveals
this
dichotomy
to
a
greater
degree
with
me
being
unable
to
pin
down
either
sweet
or
tart
but
more
like
both
at
once
this
is
very
enjoyable
and
i
would
certainly
have
more
than
one
on
a
hot
summers
day
when
the
beer
would
be
quite
refreshing
taste
is
sour
up
front
a
puckering
sourness
sour
cherry
and
wild
berry
acidic
and
fruity
but
certainly
not
sweet
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
cold
but
fill
sout
as
the
beer
warms
this
is
no
rodenbach
but
like
rodenbach
this
beer
delivers
the
sour
in
flemish
sour
red
this
one
gets
a
good
drinkability
rating
but
the
tartness
might
become
overbearing
after
a
while
its
still
good
though
generally
this
is
not
a
style
i
would
choose
to
drink
or
gravitate
towards
but
very
enjoyable
nevertheless
overall
this
one
is
interesting
i
didnt
like
the
first
few
sips
but
after
i
got
accustomed
to
it
i
really
enjoyed
the
sourness
quite
a
nice
one
to
have
on
tap
pours
a
murky
mud
color
near
the
top
of
the
glass
and
fades
into
a
light
ruby
near
the
bottom
tart
aroma
of
mahogany
wood
and
cherries
flavor
has
some
ripe
cherry
and
plum
flavors
with
a
lemon
zinger
kick
in
there
all
melding
into
the
mildly
hoppy
middle
and
eventual
tart
finish
hops
seem
to
come
through
better
as
it
warms
and
overall
gives
it
more
balances
to
cut
the
sour
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
enjoyable
a
bit
bubbly
to
blend
with
the
tartness
looking
forward
to
the
draught
but
this
is
a
nice
takehome
version
had
this
brew
the
other
night
and
poured
to
a
dark
redmahogany
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
holds
up
quite
well
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
chalice
the
aroma
is
definitely
of
sourtart
cherries
with
highlights
of
what
i
think
is
an
oak
barrel
smell
this
is
a
very
nice
smelling
brew
although
it
is
funny
having
some
friends
take
a
whiff
of
it
as
they
have
never
had
anything
like
this
the
brew
has
a
strong
cherry
and
other
berry
flavor
that
dominates
from
the
start
the
sour
taste
seems
a
little
more
harsh
than
the
mestreechs
aait
that
i
love
but
is
an
excellent
taste
as
well
also
i
can
sense
more
of
a
oakiness
from
the
taste
mixing
with
the
aroma
which
is
a
fantastic
addition
the
carbonation
of
this
brew
is
very
nice
seems
to
be
at
the
perfect
level
as
well
over
all
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
i
have
just
gotten
into
this
style
of
brew
but
i
must
say
that
i
am
sold
first
sip
reveals
a
slightly
oily
texture
with
large
and
prickly
carbonation
flavor
is
fruity
sweet
up
front
for
a
second
and
then
is
tart
tart
tart
sour
cherries
again
wooden
flavors
granny
smith
apples
reminds
me
of
jolly
rancher
candy
the
beer
finishes
leaving
a
tart
coating
on
my
palate
i
find
the
beer
to
be
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
a
nice
example
of
the
style
kicked
perhaps
a
desired
then
aquired
taste
for
certain
sour
ale
drinkers
and
this
is
probably
very
good
brew
in
its
categorystyle
but
its
just
not
my
style
take
this
review
w
a
grain
of
salt
sampled
another
bottle
at
the
sunset
and
update
review
31005
beer
is
good
happy
sour
beering
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
ac
last
weekend
overall
an
alright
beer
drinker
experience
but
not
enough
to
make
me
ooh
and
aah
after
being
poured
the
beer
looked
like
balsamic
vinegar
and
frankly
the
aroma
was
also
pretty
reminiscent
of
the
same
a
thin
white
head
topped
it
off
medium
in
mouthfeel
i
got
some
faint
kriek
like
notes
aka
sour
ones
along
with
some
dried
fruit
not
as
complex
as
anticipated
even
the
sourness
seemed
a
bit
tame
it
should
be
noted
that
this
beer
was
the
first
ever
to
have
devastating
effects
on
my
digestive
system
you
have
been
warned
pours
with
very
little
head
but
for
a
filmy
ring
of
foam
at
edge
of
beer
that
doesnt
cling
beer
itself
looks
like
dirty
apple
cider
and
wow
is
this
murky
wayyy
up
close
i
can
see
streamers
through
the
murk
so
i
give
it
a
few
good
swirls
and
am
able
to
bolster
up
a
head
about
a
quarter
inch
deep
beer
is
a
dirty
rosewood
color
with
slightly
reddish
highlights
as
soon
as
beer
is
poured
lactic
yogurty
smells
fill
up
the
entire
room
up
in
the
nose
this
only
gets
stronger
bananas
soaking
in
vinegar
pomegranate
fruitiness
with
extreme
sharp
sourness
nosefeel
is
so
pungent
it
feels
like
buttermilk
is
clotting
inside
the
nasal
cavity
desensitizing
the
entire
sinus
blades
of
flavor
slice
through
the
tongueapple
juicecider
vinegar
sour
whey
and
pectin
as
it
warms
it
starts
to
taste
more
like
gin
and
grapefruit
juice
but
oh
man
this
is
sour
with
eons
of
aftertaste
pungent
wanna
know
what
the
mouthfeel
is
like
go
do
a
shot
of
lemon
juice
its
exactly
the
same
but
put
an
enormous
bite
at
the
end
the
alcohol
went
straight
to
my
head
but
the
beer
is
remarkably
quenching
it
sent
cooling
waves
of
pleasure
up
and
down
my
spine
this
is
the
third
time
ive
had
this
and
it
just
keeps
growing
on
me
and
people
say
flemish
red
ale
is
hard
to
love
haters
can
send
their
glasses
my
way
the
taste
hits
big
and
sour
at
the
start
but
blends
into
an
appealing
woody
malt
character
midpalate
a
bit
sticky
in
the
throat
at
the
finish
but
this
problem
fades
as
the
hops
strengthen
with
warmth
giving
the
beer
a
lightly
floral
finish
with
a
slight
metallic
tinge
despite
how
it
sounds
though
this
actually
seems
to
work
in
conjunction
with
the
malt
middle
pretty
damn
drinkable
note
the
website
lists
the
abv
at
5
5
and
call
it
a
old
brown
ale
very
different
this
was
my
first
time
trying
this
style
so
it
is
hard
to
compare
it
to
anything
pours
a
very
reddishmahogony
tone
floral
aromas
are
very
apparent
and
are
noticable
on
the
palate
upon
first
taste
underlying
sweetness
is
balanced
by
sour
aftertaste
very
quenching
and
full
mouthfeel
fruitiness
and
tartness
are
apparent
as
the
beer
starts
to
warm
this
actually
reminded
me
of
certain
rose
wines
i
know
bad
analogy
on
this
site
this
could
make
a
good
session
beer
if
you
were
in
the
mood
for
something
lite
and
refreshing
other
than
that
this
would
make
an
excellent
dessert
beer
pours
a
deep
murky
brown
with
red
hues
and
a
small
white
head
that
left
barely
any
lace
aromas
give
off
a
mix
of
tartness
and
sour
cherries
with
tones
of
barnyard
vinegar
tones
flavors
are
intially
nicely
tart
and
sour
which
a
nice
fruit
tones
this
flavor
is
predominently
of
sour
cherries
with
some
grape
and
raspberry
like
flavors
this
beer
finishes
with
an
acidic
tartness
and
sourness
with
a
nice
zinging
carbonation
the
body
to
this
brew
was
a
tad
thin
but
overall
a
nice
offering
for
a
flemish
sour
that
was
not
too
syrupy
or
sugary
the
beer
as
it
sets
in
the
belgian
chalice
a
somewhat
murky
deep
red
to
almost
brown
color
the
head
a
medium
tan
color
that
is
also
creamy
in
texture
and
the
size
perfect
the
lace
forms
a
tight
skirt
to
cover
the
glass
nose
is
crisp
and
tart
the
aroma
of
over
ripe
fruit
a
hint
of
yeast
a
bit
musky
quite
a
pleasant
sniff
this
beer
start
is
lightly
sweet
then
tart
with
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
austere
in
its
acidity
the
hops
perfect
in
their
spiciness
very
dry
after
taste
that
lingers
on
and
on
i
was
simply
forced
to
have
several
glasses
before
i
boarded
my
incredibly
long
flight
back
to
phoenix
geez
i
needed
the
energy
to
withstand
that
hour
and
five
minute
flight
lol
i
try
to
have
one
of
these
whenever
i
visit
monks
it
pours
a
really
nice
light
amber
color
with
a
small
whitish
head
it
has
the
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
sourness
the
taste
ranges
from
very
tart
to
moderately
sour
i
find
that
it
depends
on
what
i
have
been
eating
or
drinking
before
tasting
the
sourness
is
never
offputting
though
i
almost
find
it
pleasantly
refreshing
in
a
way
it
has
a
very
clean
feel
in
the
mouth
that
really
prepares
you
for
a
meal
i
love
one
of
these
on
draft
before
my
lunch
but
have
never
really
wanted
a
second
the
body
is
medium
and
it
has
mild
carbonation
which
all
comes
together
to
produce
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
flavor
is
a
bit
more
dull
than
my
beloved
duchesse
but
it
is
still
pretty
good
the
sour
flavor
is
there
with
notes
of
balsamic
vinegar
some
fruit
flavors
as
well
as
citrus
come
in
grains
lay
behind
it
all
to
bring
in
some
balance
the
drinkability
is
excellent
and
i
would
have
grabbed
another
or
two
if
i
werent
on
my
way
out
from
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
rich
rubybrown
color
with
a
fizzy
active
head
of
white
carbonation
the
smell
is
very
interesting
sour
and
sultry
if
you
get
a
big
whiff
it
makes
the
back
of
your
mouth
pucker
and
smells
of
turned
milk
the
label
calls
it
lactic
the
first
taste
is
of
tart
cherry
the
finish
is
vert
tart
sour
yes
but
the
sweet
cherry
is
in
there
also
wow
incredibly
refreshing
incredible
tasty
dry
earthy
taste
from
the
unique
ferementation
i
love
the
sour
ending
a
class
act
all
around
however
if
fermentation
run
amok
gives
you
the
willies
you
might
want
to
look
elsewhere
little
pricey
also
but
worth
the
bucks
it
is
a
brownish
red
with
very
little
head
the
reserved
aroma
has
some
oak
and
vinous
notes
and
a
lactic
sourness
to
it
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
and
sour
with
some
fruit
and
oak
in
the
finish
the
sourness
is
mild
and
it
is
quite
refreshing
i
always
start
a
visit
to
monks
with
one
of
these
damn
i
dont
know
what
to
make
of
this
style
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
more
of
this
style
and
will
look
for
them
in
the
future
thanks
go
out
to
frank4sail
for
the
gift
from
pa
on
tap
nice
color
with
a
smallish
head
a
must
before
eating
had
almost
a
wine
taste
very
dry
taste
of
cherries
and
spices
i
like
the
sourness
that
finishes
a
little
hoppy
not
overpowering
but
a
shock
to
the
tastebuds
on
first
tasting
an
acquired
taste
but
opne
i
always
go
back
to
i
thought
this
beer
was
fascinating
really
my
first
try
at
this
style
unless
you
count
lambic
but
i
think
sour
alesoud
bruins
are
maltier
this
one
was
quite
nice
great
balance
between
malty
and
sour
sweet
but
not
cloying
then
sour
enough
to
dry
your
mouth
out
the
menu
suggests
this
one
as
a
palate
clenser
i
would
agree
i
could
drink
this
beer
over
and
over
and
never
really
get
that
sticky
sugary
coating
you
cometimes
get
after
having
numerous
beers
im
really
going
to
start
searching
for
this
style
not
a
beer
for
everybody
but
if
you
like
sour
and
sherry
like
drinks
you
should
indefinitely
enjoy
this
wonderful
thirstquenching
beer
pours
amberish
brown
with
white
head
that
becomes
lacy
smells
like
cherries
and
good
american
whisky
also
has
very
sherry
like
smell
taste
is
predominately
tart
and
somewhat
acidic
no
apparent
sweetness
a
rather
drinkable
beer
if
you
are
into
this
kind
of
thing
as
the
acidic
qualities
are
not
overbearing
pours
a
deep
red
with
abrownish
tint
with
about
a
14
inch
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacingaroma
is
of
sour
cherries
and
light
mineral
notes
taste
is
hits
ya
with
a
big
sour
note
that
slides
into
some
stonelike
qualities
with
that
sour
lemon
flavor
always
there
to
linger
this
style
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
for
sure
but
this
beer
is
complex
with
alot
of
different
flavors
well
made
cheers
to
frank4sail
for
the
brew
deep
garnet
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
aroma
is
of
sour
fruit
like
cranberries
and
cherries
taste
is
more
sour
than
it
is
sweet
very
light
in
body
which
makes
me
want
to
drink
a
lot
more
of
them
than
i
probably
should
hopefully
well
see
more
of
this
style
popping
up
in
america
my
first
experience
with
sour
ales
poured
a
mahogonay
with
an
off
white
head
that
receded
into
bubbles
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
smell
was
musty
and
sharp
with
plenty
of
cranberry
coming
through
taste
was
mouth
puckieringly
good
it
was
hella
sour
with
tons
of
sweet
lemon
and
cranberry
flavors
and
some
other
different
citrus
flavors
as
well
mouthfeel
was
carbonated
and
tart
this
is
a
good
beer
that
you
could
nurse
all
night
long
provided
you
have
enough
around
not
too
much
balance
in
this
beer
but
i
dont
mind
at
all
a
good
tip
of
the
scales
is
always
in
order
thanks
to
nomad
for
the
bottle
straight
from
illadelph
a
slightly
hazy
but
surprisingly
clear
given
the
style
mahogany
body
appears
reddish
in
the
glass
and
reveals
crimson
ruby
and
orange
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
the
creamy
offwhite
head
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
nice
streaks
and
splotches
of
sticky
lace
throughout
the
glass
the
nose
is
vinous
with
tempting
delicate
tart
cherries
and
what
appears
to
be
some
oakiness
its
not
as
bold
as
many
other
examples
of
the
style
and
its
certainly
cleaner
but
it
is
quite
nice
a
gentle
massage
of
soft
fine
carbonation
washes
over
the
tongue
as
it
warms
to
become
slightly
creamy
the
body
is
light
and
its
quite
smooth
again
its
more
delicate
than
many
examples
but
very
nice
in
its
own
way
the
flavor
mimics
the
nose
with
mildly
vinous
cherry
and
raspberry
its
acidity
is
restrained
in
comparison
to
most
and
its
quite
refreshing
without
becoming
puckering
theres
a
bit
of
an
oak
character
to
it
and
it
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
astringency
but
the
stickysweet
residue
of
many
other
examples
is
not
present
overall
this
is
a
quite
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beer
that
represents
the
style
well
but
is
somewhat
restrained
in
comparison
to
most
others
f
this
beer
is
not
unlike
van
steenberges
bios
which
i
loved
and
brought
several
bottles
back
from
belgium
well
worth
the
price
of
admission
quite
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
despite
the
imposing
name
i
think
even
nonbeergeeks
will
like
this
one
i
was
quite
excited
to
get
hold
of
bottles
of
this
stuff
from
the
beer
yard

sweet
malty

plumcherry
and

smell
original
sour
slightly
astringent

a
very
nice
balence
between
the
fruit

and

acidic
beginning

very
drinkable
not
heavy
mouthed
as
you
would
think
with
all
of
these

more
on
the

to
lighter

mouthfeel
is
lively
and
lighter
this
is
a
nice
rounded
satisfying
sour
patch
adult
of
a
beer
extreamly
good
looking
in
the
glass
highly
drinkable
this
is
more
of
a
session
version
of
a
sour
red
ale
as
it
didnt
have
the
complexity
or
body
of
a
duchesse
or
a
goudenband
a
good
beer
regardless
nice
of
monks
cafe
to
make
the
effort
to
contract
van
steenberge
to
brew
this
for
them
somethings
gotta
fill
the
void
while
rodenbach
is
temporarily
m
i
a
right
nice
to
throw
back
a
couple
of
these
at
the
bar
while
youre
waiting
for
a
table
fyi
some
of
the
restaurants
dishes
are
cooked
with
this
beer
too
this
poured
out
with
a
deep
brownish
red
color
the
head
was
fluffy
at
first
but
settles
rather
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
much
behind
in
lacing
or
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
wine
like
quality
to
it
and
smells
pretty
tart
on
the
nose
the
taste
follows
the
same
basic
path
at
the
smell
does
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
tart
its
got
some
very
light
carbonation
overall
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
id
say
its
worth
checking
out
called
monks
cafe
flemish
sour
red
ale
at
la
trappe
in
sf
came
out
of
the
gates
strong
but
pulled
up
a
little
lame
maybe
halfway
through
this
is
a
novelty
beer
with
a
strong
sweet
vinegar
flavor
and
cherries
but
it
is
a
little
too
much
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
end
of
it
maybe
i
just
had
too
many
sour
beers
that
day
the
taste
is
caramel
malt
as
well
as
tart
apples
and
grapes
the
apple
is
dominant
lowmedium
carbonation
and
a
thin
mouthfeel
a
pretty
nice
sour
beer
that
is
a
not
as
sour
as
some
but
has
a
nice
fruity
flavor
a
very
good
and
solid
original
beer
refreshing
in
its
lack
of
hop
character
also
called
monks
café
flemish
sour
red
ale
pours
hazy
reddish
brown
into
a
tulip
fine
bubbly
head
with
nice
retention
sour
cherry
and
vinegar
notes
and
flavor
is
just
like
the
aroma
thin
with
a
bitter
cherry
finish
light
to
med
body
a
nice
sipper
d
a
lovely
classic
flanders
red
that
goes
down
supersmooth
very
thirst
quenching
and
delicious
reminded
me
of
a
less
complex
version
of
rodenbach
similar
to
their
alexander
which
is
no
longer
brewed
interesting
would
love
to
taste
an
aged
version
d
my
wife
greg
gory4d
and
i
split
the
750ml
bottle
three
ways
and
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
had
no
problems
downing
a
couple
glasses
this
brew
is
probably
past
its
prime
but
was
still
pretty
enjoyable
poured
a
deep
ruby
redbrown
color
into
a
tulip
glass
with
a
thin
fluffy
off
white
head
the
smells
of
balsamic
sour
woodiness
with
hints
of
burnt
cherry
tastes
of
lightly
toasted
bread
oak
cherries
and
suttle
chocolate
mouthfeel
starts
sweet
and
tart
and
finishes
dry
i
was
hoping
to
have
a
little
more
complex
brew
here
it
was
a
little
of
a
let
down
i
cant
see
colors
so
it
get
a
good
rating
this
beer
was
really
good
i
brought
it
back
from
my
belgium
trip
the
old
brown
style
was
tougher
to
find
than
i
thought
this
one
was
a
great
example
though
the
sweetness
that
would
be
expected
from
a
brownish
style
of
beer
but
heavily
hit
up
with
brett
sourness
i
think
that
the
sour
was
a
good
mix
slightly
more
powerful
than
the
maltiness
in
this
beer
really
enjoyed
this
bio
beer
they
seem
to
be
a
bit
of
the
trend
right
now
in
belgium
just
like
the
organic
beer
trend
here
in
the
states
pours
a
dark
brown
foggy
minimal
creme
head
nose
is
biting
that
sharp
brett
infused
kind
of
thing
wood
and
cherry
tones
are
there
flavor
is
a
biting
vinegar
a
little
too
much
so
imo
id
like
a
bit
more
wood
and
fruit
tones
still
though
it
works
well
enough
for
sour
freaks
like
me
there
is
still
a
good
enough
balance
to
it
feel
is
typical
liquid
is
good
and
carbonation
is
a
bit
biting
you
really
have
to
appreciate
the
sours
to
be
able
to
dig
this
one
if
youre
in
that
boat
youll
like
it
saw
it
on
the
menu
of
bishops
arms
stockholm
and
just
had
to
try
it
looks
like
exclusive
rum
very
clear
darkish
amber
heavy
sweet
smell
of
raisins
and
rum
smooth
taste
with
more
of
the
same
you
can
really
feel
the
years
in
this
one
although
its
not
as
heavy
as
a
glass
of
rum
you
have
to
drink
it
slowly
and
savor
every
sip
notes
from
122706
pours
a
very
murky
dark
brown
in
color
with
ruby
highlights
smell
is
extremely
sour
catches
you
off
the
bat
very
sour
taste
is
very
sour
very
highly
carbonated
but
still
very
sour
some
nice
dark
fruits
but
the
sourness
takes
over
the
beer
and
dominates
very
good
beer
i
would
put
this
up
against
rodenbach
or
the
ommegang
grand
cru
that
i
just
had
a
growler
of
well
done
i
would
say
without
a
doubt
the
long
finish
is
the
most
striking
aspect
of
this
beer
i
cannot
pick
up
much
resemblence
between
this
and
the
monks
cafe
product
this
brewery
produces
for
a
us
customer
this
certainly
a
decent
example
of
the
style
and
it
is
fairly
tasty
tipple
to
boot
but
it
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
the
acidity
makes
it
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
some
extra
malt
and
perhaps
even
some
more
funk
would
make
this
quite
a
bit
more
enjoyable
a
fine
belgian
ale
but
not
exceptional
a
flanders
sour
aroma
wine
like
alcohol
whiff
nice
redish
sight
ok
in
taste
understated
cherry
and
not
overly
sour
wood
vanilla
moderate
carbonation
medium
to
thin
mouthfeel
but
refreshing
easy
drink
underated
worth
a
try
and
i
would
have
again
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
tint
almost
like
a
wine
smell
is
pungent
and
involves
plums
raisins
and
other
dark
fruits
the
taste
is
quite
unique
much
like
the
plums
and
raisins
mentioned
before
but
there
is
a
hint
of
the
more
tasty
wine
in
there
it
leaves
an
aftertaste
that
is
really
enjoyable
of
a
sweetness
like
plums
this
is
a
great
beer
that
is
unique
any
one
who
is
looking
to
try
something
new
will
enjoy
bottle
poured
a
brownish
red
color
beer
with
a
medium
offwhite
foamy
head
with
some
pretty
good
retention
aroma
is
quite
sour
and
you
can
already
feel
the
effect
of
the
oak
on
this
beer
taste
is
quite
acid
with
some
subtle
sweetness
at
the
end
cheery
feels
is
less
present
then
in
the
rodenbach
grand
cru
but
can
still
be
detected
overall
i
find
this
one
to
be
a
good
flemish
sour
ale
and
would
even
say
that
it
seems
to
be
underrated
compared
to
some
other
flemish
sour
ale
murky
red
brown
not
a
terribly
big
head
proper
soggy
wood
and
sour
cherry
notes
in
the
aroma
taste
brings
that
wonderful
acidic
touch
along
with
a
fruity
sweetness
and
a
soft
but
strong
sourness
smooth
and
tasty
thoroughly
drinkable
glad
am
i
that
two
bottles
turned
up
instead
of
one
deelish
very
sour
tart
nose
and
palate
with
hints
of
cherry
the
skins
in
both
sweetish
cherry
start
with
a
sweet
and
sour
finish
a
bit
vinegary
very
refreshing
fullflavoured
flanders
red
very
cheap
in
belgium
to
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
that
ive
had
so
far
o
delicious
keeps
you
wanting
more
never
to
sweet
but
personally
i
could
have
it
more
sour
maybe
too
mellow
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
tho
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
small
snifter
tall
white
head
high
retention
suddsy
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
body
is
a
deep
mahogany
aroma
is
citric
green
apple
some
vinegar
some
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
this
beer
is
noted
for
its
sweet
to
sour
balance
the
sour
dominates
the
aroma
taste
is
mouth
puckering
quite
tart
again
with
green
apples
the
sweetness
to
me
is
on
the
back
end
and
pretty
faint
it
does
make
for
a
unique
experience
this
beer
is
delicious
and
style
points
are
certainly
deserved
had
this
on
tap
at
kickbacks
jacksonville
where
else
would
i
get
to
try
something
so
rare
this
beer
was
hyped
up
alot
and
i
actually
made
a
trip
especially
try
this
usually
when
i
do
this
and
gaer
this
muvh
about
it
its
a
let
down
the
best
thing
was
the
appearance
loved
the
dark
body
almost
stout
like
with
nice
white
fluffy
head
poured
inna
tulip
glass
it
looked
like
a
sundae
great
aromas
and
flavors
of
dark
malts
and
a
nice
medium
body
not
overly
sour
and
i
loved
the
balance
of
sweetness
near
perfect
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
deep
yellow
reddish
brown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
remained
throughout
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
raspberry
strawberry
sour
wood
and
sugar
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
strawberry
raspberry
fruit
sugar
wood
and
subtle
tart
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
good
brew
i
went
into
this
one
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
at
all
what
i
found
really
wasnt
too
bad
there
was
a
huge
amount
of
sweetness
going
on
that
made
this
one
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
nice
touch
of
tartness
going
on
really
helped
this
aspect
as
well
to
make
it
fairly
well
balanced
it
would
definitely
be
easy
to
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
before
realizing
you
had
done
so
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
my
favorite
sour
and
apparently
rare
in
that
i
cant
find
it
anywhere
else
any
longer
if
any
of
you
reading
this
know
of
a
place
in
chicago
that
has
this
beer
for
sale
and
feel
like
sharing
let
me
know
enjoyed
on
tap
at
blue
monk
very
dark
head
with
lots
of
lace
and
a
quarter
inch
of
retained
head
sour
cherry
and
wood
aroma
medium
bodied
a
bit
of
vinegar
in
finish
comes
across
most
as
a
mellowed
flanders
red
satisfying
very
good
drinkability
wood
taste
is
only
nominal
pours
a
deep
reddish
brown
fingerwidth
head
that
stays
a
while
smell
is
of
very
tart
cherries
a
little
woodsy
character
and
malt
taste
is
actually
sweeter
than
the
smell
would
have
you
guess
still
a
tad
sour
in
the
middle
but
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
and
cherries
dominate
i
like
that
this
beer
is
a
blend
of
a
sour
and
a
dortmunder
it
works
well
o
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
sweet
and
sourtart
flavors
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
would
be
happy
to
sip
on
this
beer
all
afternoon
o
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
its
neither
too
sweet
nor
sour
and
is
quite
easy
to
drink
compared
to
others
in
the
style
pours
a
clear
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
sour
tart
and
funky
with
some
vinegar
and
berry
fruit
aromas
taste
is
only
slightly
sour
but
mainly
has
sweet
berry
jellyjam
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
more
sweet
than
sour
in
the
flavor
10122006
not
as
sour
as
rodenbach
or
as
woody
sweet
and
complex
as
the
duchesse
overall
a
solid
flanders
red
balancing
the
best
qualities
of
the
style
try
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
it
doesnt
age
so
well
definitely
try
if
you
can
and
grab
some
for
seconds
poured
a
reddish
brown
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
on
top
of
an
aroma
that
i
can
only
say
is
sweet
like
caramel
or
just
plain
sugar
while
also
this
wicked
sourness
and
funk
taste
is
more
of
the
same
as
theres
an
underlying
sweetness
combod
w
tart
fruits
like
cherry
while
this
sour
funk
patch
just
keeps
going
easy
to
drink
yet
a
sipper
bc
it
just
keeps
mixing
it
up
and
then
finishes
with
a
rather
crisp
sour
finish
just
excellent
loved
this
one
i
only
got
a
small
pour
but
i
savored
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
served
in
a
tulip
glass
closer
to
room
temp
ruddy
brown
color
a
small
head
that
sank
to
a
few
stray
bubbles
aroma
was
not
too
pronounced
but
there
were
definite
tones
of
cherries
and
acetic
acid
taste
mmm
cherries
up
front
not
too
sweet
not
too
sour
but
just
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
great
balance
also
detectable
were
notes
of
oak
red
wine
grapes
vinegar
and
leathery
newcar
essence
about
mediumbodied
juicy
but
still
very
rich
and
flavorful
and
not
overly
watery
like
other
beers
of
the
style
that
ive
had
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
mild
and
complex
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
o
very
enjoyable
beer
that
was
a
nice
whoops
pour
im
happy
to
have
stumbled
upon
this
tasty
treat
at
the
bavarian
lodge
and
it
is
one
of
many
tasty
hidden
gems
found
within
this
awesome
place
overall
impression
what
a
strange
but
good
brew
with
the
grape
and
cola
flavors
this
one
was
shockingly
different
a
light
amount
of
acidity
is
in
here
but
for
a
flanders
red
im
sure
its
not
too
big
of
a
problem
if
you
can
get
around
to
enjoying
this
one
the
reason
i
did
was
bc
john
said
they
will
never
be
getting
this
one
again
and
that
is
was
a
very
limited
sour
overall
this
was
one
of
the
leastsweet
flanders
reds
ive
had
in
a
while
and
it
was
certainly
enjoyable
worth
a
shot
i
would
drink
this
regularly
if
i
could
o
this
beer
is
incredibly
well
rounded
with
all
the
right
flavor
notes
simple
yet
complex
a
true
flavor
explosion
with
the
body
and
mouth
to
make
you
want
to
slam
down
a
few
more
superb
cheers
o
a
very
good
sour
because
of
the
finish
i
would
drink
it
again
o
this
is
a
fantastic
red
beer
and
reminded
me
a
lot
of
bellegems
bruin
with
its
subtle
brilliance
well
worth
a
try
overall
good
nice
malts
and
fruits
great
cherry
flavors
low
abv
and
drinkable
overall
this
was
my
first
experience
with
this
brew
always
up
for
soursflandersflemish
yada
yada
id
order
this
beer
again
in
a
second
overall
this
is
the
best
flemish
sour
ive
ever
had
it
has
a
complexity
and
balance
that
a
lot
of
sours
lack
dark
brown
solid
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
nose
is
light
tart
roasty
mildly
lactic
and
refreshing
very
grainy
and
rustic
some
sweetness
is
noticeable
palate
opens
very
sweet
artificial
almost
like
equal
it
really
gets
in
the
way
covering
up
the
grain
and
tartness
sweet
artificially
so
on
the
finish
with
a
mild
grainy
husky
character
light
in
body
with
high
carbonation
this
beer
is
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
i
cant
really
recommend
this
pours
a
very
dark
garnet
that
is
clear
minimal
head
but
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
nose
is
berry
like
with
an
almost
inky
edge
flavor
is
smooth
berry
tones
that
are
strong
but
not
overpowering
or
overdone
sweet
and
even
feel
is
close
to
syrupy
extremely
drinkable
could
go
for
this
a
lot
especially
at
the
price
definitely
worth
a
try
or
two
d
this
is
a
simple
but
solid
example
of
this
style
definitely
worth
trying
but
id
probably
take
a
rodenbach
over
this
drinkable
yep
d
quite
refreshing
as
far
as
sour
beers
go
drinkability
not
really
too
much
to
say
about
this
one
on
tap
poured
into
a
tulip
this
ale
pours
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
small
quickly
diminishing
offwhitebeige
head
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
light
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aromas
are
that
of
sweetsour
cherries
light
wood
and
notes
of
some
vinegar
the
vinegar
smell
is
not
overpowering
and
somehow
finds
a
way
to
blend
with
the
other
flavors
to
make
a
smooth
refreshing
drink
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
the
ale
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
a
slight
hint
of
sourness
left
on
your
tounge
nicely
done
thanks
eclectic
for
the
opportunity
drinkability
notes

not
an
overly
complex
sour
red
but
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
an
interesting
varient
of
the
flanders
red
and
if
wild
brews
is
correct
soon
to
be
gone
this
ones
simply
a
must
bottle
or
tap
its
really
a
delicious
and
appealing
rendition
of
the
style
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
slow
sipper
that
grows
on
you
as
it
warms
not
a
beer
you
can
have
several
of
in
a
session
but
this
could
be
easily
enjoyed
several
nights
in
row
without
getting
bored
cherry
red
color
lightly
acidic
nose
vinous
peppery
with
hints
of
balsamic
vinegar
a
touch
of
red
fruit
i
find
this
to
be
poorly
blended
too
much
lager
and
not
enough
sour
ale
its
definately
a
let
down
compared
to
the
aroma
which
led
me
to
believe
this
was
going
to
be
intensely
sour
the
caramel
sweetness
from
the
lager
seems
to
be
the
most
dominant
here
and
i
look
for
a
drier
less
approchable
and
more
sour
version
of
red
ale
d
this
beer
is
a
gateway
beer
to
the
flanders
reds
it
is
very
soft
and
mild
leaving
me
wanting
more
pucker
more
sour
and
more
oak
notes
i
think
it
needs
more
of
everything
but
it
is
pleasant
to
drink
if
i
wasnt
hoping
for
a
big
flanders
drinkability
fine
example
of
a
flanders
worth
trying
for
sure
11

swing
top
bottle
pours
a
deep
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
creamy
light
brown
head
that
leaves
a
sticky
lacing
in
my
glass
fruity
vinegar
aromas
cherry
sour
apple
and
vinegar
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
sour
very
delicious
i
tried
it
once
thats
enough
i
recommend
rodenbach
over
this
not
my
favorite
flanders
red
ale
but
worth
a
try
there
be
plenty
of
tart
sassiness
here
but
its
simple
to
take
it
in
stride
as
a
comfy
compliment
to
the
flavor
elements
that
come
into
play
its
utterly
drinkable
quenching
in
its
way
and
alive
in
the
mouth
sparkling
and
tinkling
as
it
crosses
over
its
got
everything
youd
expect
in
the
style
and
while
it
isnt
incredible
it
is
memorable
and
outright
good
and
thats
a
commendable
achievement
a
funky
take
on
sour
ales
i
was
surprised
by
the
mouthfeel
which
was
dominated
by
the
sharp
bubblesonthetongue
feel
i
associate
with
seltzer
water
because
of
this
or
at
least
in
keeping
with
this
the
taste
reminded
me
in
some
ways
of
italian
sodas
it
almost
could
have
been
cherry
or
raspberry
italian
soda
from
starbucks
there
were
some
tart
and
sour
flavors
that
wouldnt
let
me
forget
that
i
was
drinking
a
flanders
red
but
the
overall
impression
was
of
something
that
was
one
of
a
kind
i
appreciated
this
beer
for
its
uniqueness
but
it
didnt
provide
all
that
much
enjoyment
the
mouth
seems
a
bit
light
for
the
style
but
the
drinkability
is
exceptional
first
i
must
assume
that
i
have
the
right
brew
as
i
bought
this
in
the
us
therefore
am
going
with
the
assumption
that
this
is
the
us
nonsaccharin
version
poured
out
to
a
dark
red
amber
color
with
a
very
nice
head
and
good
lace
around
the
glass
odors
of
sweet
grapes
and
plumbs
that
have
fermented
very
nice
flavors
of
sweet
fruit
and
dark
berries
are
most
present
as
is
a
slight
sourness
that
lurks
in
the
background
also
a
slightly
roasted
quality
was
present
which
added
to
the
limited
complexity
of
this
beer
finished
smooth
with
some
bite
toward
the
end
but
just
enough
to
get
your
attention
and
invite
you
back
for
another
sip
this
is
a
good
sipping
ale
highly
recommended
if
you
have
never
had
a
flanders
red
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
mestreech
poured
to
a
beautiful
ruby
red
with
a
slightly
tannish
head
distinct
berry
aroma
with
a
sharp
tangy
taste
that
seems
to
be
a
bit
to
tart
but
certainly
a
beer
worth
looking
for
overall
one
of
my
favorite
sour
reds
out
there
this
beer
pours
a
dark
crimson
brown
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
aroma
is
weak
but
fruity
and
slightly
tart
taste
has
more
of
a
balance
between
the
fruit
flavors
and
the
sour
flavors
a
little
chocolate
underneath
but
i
cant
really
get
anything
definitive
im
searching
for
a
striking
flavor
and
i
cant
really
find
any
its
good
really
smooth
and
drinkable
but
nothing
really
piques
my
intrigue
in
this
one
good
but
nothing
amazing
its
about
time
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
definitly
a
unique
beer
but
not
all
that
incredibly
wonderful
its
smooth
and
balanced
but
has
very
little
focus
which
kills
the
drinkability
for
me
at
least
its
different
and
thats
more
than
i
can
say
about
alot
of
brews
nowadays
refreshing
and
exciting
found
this
in
champaign
il
a
few
weeks
back
and
had
to
grab
it
i
tried
it
on
tap
last
thursday
and
really
enjoyed
it
so
lets
see
what
the
bottle
does
for
me
it
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
color
with
a
light
coating
of
foam
over
top
the
nose
on
this
is
divine
huge
sweetsourtartcherry
blast
infuses
my
nostrils
just
intense
love
it
the
flavor
is
slightly
puckering
initially
but
quickly
fades
to
a
lightly
tart
and
creamy
cherry
it
finishes
very
mellow
i
like
the
striking
difference
from
the
initial
flavor
to
the
finish
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
creamy
feel
to
it
just
a
light
carbonation
keeps
things
balanced
highly
drinkable
very
refreshing
on
a
early
summer
evening
plop
top
bottle
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
comes
out
with
a
big
sour
character
then
is
followed
up
by
a
lot
of
sweet
fruitiness
interesting
the
flavor
is
slightly
less
sweet
than
expected
but
still
has
quite
a
bit
of
sweetness
has
a
solid
tartsour
thing
going
on
but
its
not
over
the
top
lots
of
cherry
flavor
going
on
to
follow
the
sourness
very
smooth
for
the
style
has
an
almost
creamy
body
drinkability
is
great
this
one
is
much
less
sour
than
others
ive
had
making
it
a
little
easier
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
but
its
smooth
refreshing
and
enjoyable
each
sip
is
quite
complex
and
keeps
me
coming
back
for
another
this
is
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
have
sat
down
to
a
750
no
problem
and
i
wish
i
had
more
than
11
2oz
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
flanders
red
ales
and
i
would
recommend
this
one
as
well
much
thanks
to
unclejimbo
for
the
bottle
a
nice
red
ale
but
not
a
slam
dunk

some
good
flavors
picked
up
from
the

very
interesting
beer
not
the
most
drinkable
but
very
good
i
bought
this
little
stoppered
swingtop
bottle
because
i
thought
it
looked
interesting
even
though
im
not
yet
wellversed
in
the
flanders
red
ale
style
i
consider
mestreechs
aajt
to
be
uncommonly
good
beer
i
love
rewarding
impulse
purchases
thanks
to
beerookie
for
letting
me
enjoy
this
for
the
first
time
xo
this
flanders
red
or
is
it
a
flemish
brown
ale
poured
a
clear
dark
coffee
brown
color
with
light
brown
foam
that
settled
leaving
suds
on
the
surface
but
clinging
to
the
glass
a
bit
in
clumps
the
smell
was
sharp
and
tart
and
even
a
bit
sour
with
a
wild
citrus
and
cherry
aroma
going
on
i
love
it
the
taste
was
tart
to
sour
but
with
an
underlying
sweetness
especially
towards
the
finish
there
were
woody
notes
and
some
wild
funkiness
and
a
fruity
cherry
flavor
where
does
that
come
from
and
a
base
maltiness
under
it
all
a
great
flavor
that
really
grew
on
me
from
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
wonderfullly
tart
with
medium
body
and
modest
carbonation
the
malt
and
tart
flavors
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
when
it
is
fresh
it
is
incredible
but
when
it
is
old
especially
on
tap
it
loses
its
luster
quickly
pours
a
dark
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
no
head
to
speak
of
aromas
are
more
like
a
cider
than
any
malt
or
hops
the
flavors
are
very
muted
nothing
really
stands
out
some
granny
smith
apple
flavors
some
crispness
grass
and
lightly
soured
there
is
a
little
sourness
left
after
swallowing
but
overall
very
little
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
lightly
carbonated
and
quaffable
inoffensive
i
wuold
not
buy
this
again
but
was
a
decent
enought
beer
unobtrusive
smooth
easydrinker
with
little
spunk
not
a
beer
id
buy
again
the
lack
of
complexity
suprised
me
considering
this
styles
reputation
for
it
but
i
was
fairly
satisfied
overall
i
was
excited
to
try
a
new
flemish
red
ale
but
this
really
didnt
cut
it
for
me
and
yes
it
was
the
5
us
version
a
dark
reddish
plum
with
a
small
head
of
offwhitebeige
the
aromas
were
of
several
malts
a
bit
of
oak
some
funk
and
no
hops
the
taste
was
quite
malty
but
pretty
one
dimensional
with
a
bit
of
oak
in
the
mix
as
well
this
was
ok
but
bland
for
a
flemish
red
and
nowhere
near
a
rodenbach
level
of
complexity
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
decent
but
the
drinkability
was
not
the
best
decent
for
a
flemish
red
but
there
are
many
better
examples
imho
was
able
to
give
this
brew
a
try
last
evening
while
at
mahars
what
a
fantastic
brew
it
poured
to
a
reddish
brown
color
and
left
a
fair
sized
offwhite
head
that
had
nice
retention
and
left
very
nice
lacing
through
out
the
whole
brew
the
smells
where
very
aromatic
with
dark
fruits
mostly
sour
cherries
being
predominant
the
taste
is
fantastic
sourness
is
very
pronounced
from
the
getgo
along
with
a
rich
malt
flavor
also
can
notice
yeast
like
flavor
with
this
brew
that
seems
to
give
it
a
bread
like
note
the
sourness
is
very
smooth
and
goes
extraordinary
well
with
this
brew
this
is
an
extremely
easy
drinking
brew
and
i
must
say
has
become
one
of
my
favorites
if
you
can
give
this
brew
a
try
matters
if
you
enjoy
this
class
of
brew
but
if
so
i
think
you
will
be
very
happy
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
grainy
with
a
medium
body
and
active
carbonation
wierd
but
definately
grows
on
you
i
saw
it
on
tap
at
delaneys
new
haven
ct
but
didnt
try
it
now
i
wish
that
i
had
it
begins
with
this
intense
sourness
that
just
gives
way
completely
to
a
cherry
note
that
ends
with
the
cherries
almost
leaving
and
no
sourness
or
tartness
it
is
quite
incredible
that
this
happens
as
the
sourness
just
kind
of
kicks
you
and
runs
away
rather
quickly
getting
used
to
this
one
is
amazing
i
love
the
way
it
comes
down
i
dont
think
there
should
have
been
huge
bubbly
carbonation
but
the
slight
carbonation
is
less
than
amazing
good
beer
though
maybe
some
more
tartness
and
some
more
carbonation
next
time
if
it
was
not
so
pricey
i
coul
make
this
a
regular
after
yardwork
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
fruity
and
the
drinkability
on
these
flanders
sour
reds
is
never
that
high
anyway
this
one
is
not
as
good
as
some
others
of
this
style
i
have
tried
i
would
probably
not
buy
this
one
again
beer
is
good
happy
sour
beering
i
also
get
some
banana
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
11
2
ounce
bail
top
bottle
no
sediment
in
bottle
none
purchased
at
greens
warehouse
in
columbia
sc
very
complex
and
interesting
i
am
glad
i
made
this
purchase
my
first
flanders
red
and
certainly
an
enjoyable
experience
a
big
thanks
goes
out
to
humblepatience
for
the
chance
to
try
this
the
taste
is
divine
some
toffeeish
malt
flavors
around
the
edges
envelop
the
essence
of
this
nectar
the
tart
fruitiness
that
is
mouth
puckering
sour
cherries
seem
to
combine
with
green
apples
plucked
from
the
tree
several
weeks
before
theyre
ripe
woody
tones
are
noted
as
well
suggestive
of
oak
barrel
aging
the
yeast
is
more
prominent
in
the
nose
than
the
taste
but
offers
a
welcome
earthiness
the
complexities
combine
for
a
subtle
and
well
balanced
palate
that
is
exceptionally
drinkable
this
ale
is
not
heavy
at
all
and
is
anything
but
cloying
i
could
have
several
of
these
at
a
sitting
i
dont
mean
to
imply
that
this
is
not
a
sipping
ale
for
it
most
certainly
is
i
cant
believe
that
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
another
beer
road
trip
is
definitely
in
the
near
future
in
order
to
acquire
a
decent
stock
of
this
fine
flanders
red
gulpener
by
the
way
is
brewed
in
netherlands
limburg
province
very
near
the
belgian
border
so
this
one
can
lay
a
good
claim
to
regional
authenticity
an
excellent
experience
here
i
need
more
drinkability
notes
extremely
drinkable
and
surprisingly
approachable
quite
awesome

pours
a
deep
reddish
auburn
color
with
a
medium

thin
and
quick
lacing
the
aroma

with
vinegar
and
spice

and
smooth

tart

apple
again
yeast
and
some
malt
tastes
also
a
little
bit
of
a
cabernet
or
concorde
grape
wine
flavor
the
finish
is
fruity
and
earthy
and
maintains
the
sourness
i
am
still
having
trouble
appreciating
this
style
but
i
would
probably
try
this
again
had
this
on
tap
at
redbones
his
weekend
hanging
with
david
and
uncle
jimbo
pour
was
dark
garnet
in
color
faint
low
tan
head
that
went
away
leaving
me
with
a
small
rorshach
sp
pattern
on
top
i
had
three
of
these
in
a
row
and
picked
up
different
aromas
in
almost
every
glass
ranging
from
a
sour
fruitkrieklike
one
to
concord
grapes
to
some
musty
barnyard
aromas
i
have
to
say
i
havent
had
a
beer
this
good
in
a
while
and
it
was
definitely
a
real
pleasure
medium
mouthfeel
and
fine
carbonation
add
in
making
the
taste
last
the
balance
of
sweet
to
tart
is
perfection
and
both
sensations
are
not
over
the
top
main
flavor
notes
were
low
malt
backbone
with
really
just
sweet
and
tart
fruit
notes
one
minute
kriek
the
other
grape
there
was
some
lingering
astringency
in
the
finish
outstanding
drinkability

this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
they
pulled
it
off
well
enough
edit
is
this
the
same
stuff
everyone
else
tried
wow
no
cloying
sweetness
at
all
this
seems
to
me
like
the
closest
a
sour
beer
can
come
to
a
session
brew
crazy
great
treat
on
draft
at
the
exton
pa
drafting
room
nice
looking
beer
deep
mahogany
red
with
a
light
beige
head
that
left
scant
but
noticeable
lacing
smell
is
nice
and
funkified
definately
pick
up
the
lactic
sourness
but
a
distinct
mustiness
is
present
also
that
is
also
present
as
a
flavor
component
something
that
i
found
ever
so
slightly
amiss
in
this
beer
nice
sweet
component
to
the
beer
which
balances
the
strong
sourness
but
that
dirty
kind
of
musty
taste
didnt
sit
right
with
me
i
think
i
like
a
bit
cleaner
sourness
in
a
flanders
red
perhaps
it
was
just
the
rather
strong
sourness
that
makes
me
think
its
a
bit
musty
decent
mouthfeel
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
2
or
3
of
these
but
all
in
all
pretty
good
overall
i
happened
to
have
this
on
draft
at
the
spuyten
duyvil
during
the
nyc
ba
get
together
on
july
24
this
year
it
seemed
to
have
a
tad
more
complexity
and
bite
on
draft
from
memory
as
well
as
being
a
little
sourer
this
is
rather
strange
because
i
find
the
exact
opposite
for
the
duchesse
regradless
the
bottle
is
still
great
though
but
lacks
a
little
when
compared
to
the
draft
version
nevertheless
this
is
an
accomplished
flemish
red
style
ale
for
sure
and
well
worth
seeking
out
smells
like
a
stinky
sour
cherry
lambic
looks
like
a
dark
brown
ale
the
color
of
redtinged
bark
with
a
miniscule
but
solid
white
head
left
a
good
snail
trail
of
lacing
behind
a
smooth
chocolateymalt
taste
of
black
cherries
sugar
caramel
and
overripe
sour
berries
great
light
and
silky

very
drinkable

not

take
some

but
clearly
an
interesting
complex
creation
have
an
open

and
give
this
stuff
a
try
drinkability
for
such
a
wild
taste
this
beer
just
begs
to
be
drank
all
the
flavors
along
with
the
right
amount
of

makes
this

go
down

a
nice
big

but
is

that
aroma
is
beautiful
cherrysourness
probably
the
best
part
of
the
beer
taste
is
not
that
impressive
cherry
a
little
sweetness
but
a
very
chalky
feeling
on
taste
buds
and
back
of
throat
there
really
is
not
much
there
ng
despite
the
quickness
on
the
palate
this
beer
could
quite
possibly
be
one
of
my
top
picks
of
the
year
its
highly
refreshing
and
packed
with
simple
bold
and
clean
flavors
simply
an
amazing
beer
cherry
and
vinegar
in
the
aroma
very
unpleasant
metallic
taste
sweet
crisp
tart
and
slightly
bready
a
good
sour
for
a
cool
fall
night
body
was
a
little
heavy
but
flavor
profile
was
ll
there
this
is
drinking
so
much
better
than
at
release
a
bit
more
tartness
and
a
hit
of
an
acetic
cherry
flavor
i
cant
be
sure
the
metallic
flavor
has
completely
fallen
off
hard
to
be
objective
when
i
know
how
pronounced
that
flavor
was
when
the
beer
was
fresh
but
at
a
minimum
its
dramatically
reduced
this
is
starting
to
feel
more
like
a
good
example
of
the
style
rather
than
an
averagetomediocre
one
absolutely
terrible
tasted
like
a
mouthful
of
pennies

definitely
worth
a

very

the
best
representation
of
the
style
perfectly
balanced

color
is
murky
but
still
appealing
othis
is
my
second
flanders
and
i
like
this
one
much
more
complex
taste
and
not
overpoweringly
sour
pretty
creamy
but
also
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
offering
i
would
drink
it
again
and
if
it
were
available
where
i
live
i
would
probably
try
to
pick
up
some
i
am
not
sure
how
it
is
packaged
nevertheless
it
is
solid
and
enjoyable
especially
one
to
end
the
night
on
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
match
up
to
really
great
belgian
oud
bruins
the
balance
in
the
nose
is
good
but
the
sourness
subdued
as
it
may
be
is
more
acetic
and
doesnt
quite
match
the
malty
sweetness
im
not
terribly
impressed
with
the
beer
overall
or
as
an
example
of
the
style
a
decent
beer
clean
and
somewhat
refreshing
as
most
tart
sour
beers
are
i
liked
it
but
since
sours
type
beers
arent
a
style
to
which
i
gravitate
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
mostly
because
of
costs
disappointed
overall
but
im
compring
against
their
other
sour
efforts
which
are
some
of
my
favorites
wild
ale
cran
bic
lots
of
cherry
smell
on
the
light
side
bright
tasting
short
finish
very
nice
a
new
style
for
me
sour
and
sweet
complex
i
was
the
only
one
in
my
group
impressed
by
this
and
i
have
to
explain
it
like
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
belgian
type
old
world
oud
briun
this
is
not
your
beer
this
is
uniquely
american
more
than
that
uniquely
wisconsin
and
i
dug
it
a
whole
lot
lighter
in
color
beige
and
brown
together
with
a
caramel
tint
and
a
tall
fizzy
off
white
head
it
smells
like
a
funked
out
raw
apple
cider
tart
enough
but
thats
only
one
element
among
several
the
apple
fruitiness
is
really
cool
the
grain
isnt
the
least
bit
sweet
and
the
yeast
profile
is
a
nice
mix
of
acidity
building
bacteria
and
classic
farmhouse
tang
lighter
in
body
and
feel
than
any
belgian
take
ive
had
with
some
of
the
most
intensely
effervescent
carbonation
out
there
and
only
a
medium
body
at
the
most
the
beer
finishes
forever
its
like
a
musty
old
decaying
wooden
cider
press
the
kind
of
thing
you
appreciate
and
revere
even
if
its
less
useful
than
it
once
was
or
usurped
by
some
more
modern
technology
in
the
name
of
efficiency
or
profit
or
labor
reduction
i
for
one
love
what
i
get
here
a
nice
slice
of
vintage
americana
in
a
belgian
style
ale
unlike
any
other
out
there
sours
arent
usually
my
thing
this
one
was
good
nice
tart
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
very
malty
in
the
aftertaste
the
nose
was
full
of
oak
and
whisky
smell
had
more
alcohol
than
did
taste
much
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
this
style
for
me
o
this
one
good
potential
but
the
midpalate
was
just
to
watery
to
match
the
tart
finish
perhaps
some
age
will
help
o
though
the
flavors
marry
well
together
i
was
looking
for
both
a
tad
more
sweetness
and
a
tad
more
sourness
still
a
pretty
easygoing
sour
that
i
would
recommend
to
someone
trying
to
break
in
to
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
good
right
now
but
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
it
could
be
all
the
flavors
i
want
are
there
i
just
believe
some
age
or
maybe
some
slight
alterations
in
the
recipe
or
process
could
really
bring
out
some
strong
and
tasty
characteristics
luckily
i
have
some
more
to
see
how
it
develops
overtime
45
o
well
balanced
i
typically
expect
flanders
styles
to
have
less
carbonation
and
more
of
that
old
aroma
and
flavor
however
this
would
be
very
good
in
the
summer
watery
light
body
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
overly
acidic
oud
bruins
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
nice
sweetness
balanced
by
just
a
hint
of
tart
and
vinegar
definitely
worth
trying
otoo
me
it
was
more
of
a
quad
than
a
sour
the
tartness
needed
to
be
kicked
up
to
where
it
was
at
least
rather
noticeable
has
a
distinctive
malt
foundation
which
goes
side
by
side
with
slightly
sour
fermented
grapes
acidity
remains
restrained
adding
a
gentle
tingling
bite
to
the
fruit
while
a
dry
citraic
note
enhances
the
brews
complexity
then
earthy
musty
malts
take
over
while
a
sweet
note
of
fruit
sugar
and
toffee
gets
introduced
this
maltiness
overpowers
the
much
more
interesting
sour
aspect
of
the
beer
leading
to
a
smooth
mouthfeel
which
finishes
very
soft
with
an
underlying
earthy
sweetness
nose
basically
reflects
the
taste
this
is
a
little
too
honest
for
a
flanders
red
ale
while
the
heavy
malts
focus
by
itself
could
actually
lead
to
an
interesting
new
interpretation
of
this
style
it
has
to
interact
properly
with
the
sour
fruity
ingredients
to
create
an
exiting
complexity
bottle
as
an
extra
in
trade
thanks

a
rare
miss
from
new
glarus
on
this
one
bad
bottle
maybe
well
new
glarus
has
made
sours
fruit
beers
sometimes
both
at
once
that
are
vastly
superior
to
this
beer
kind
of
like
trying
in
vain
to
watch
the
remake
of
footlooseno
i
take
that
back
issue
a
public
apology
to
new
glarus
for
that
horrid
insult
still
pretty
good
o
i
believe
this
is
my
first
of
this
style
at
least
a
full
beer
not
my
favorite
but
enjoyed
it
overall
this
is
the
first
shot
at
the
oud
bruin
style
and
i
have
to
say
i
think
i
picked
a
great
sample
tmo
follows
the
nose
with
an
overripe
dark
cherry
sour
and
gushing
soft
odd
metallic
thing
on
the
finish
but
other
than
that
a
very
sour
cherry
soda
type
of
a
beer
a
bit
fizzy
but
enjoyable
happy
to
have
a
bottle
vs
a
6er
but
wouldnt
mind
another
or
two
hazy
copper
brown

with
a

fruit
malt
vanilla
cherry
silky
smooth
and
mildly
sweet
cherry
and
vanilla
flavors
with
distant
notes
of
vanilla
apple
and
oak
an
interesting
and
unorthodox
take
on
the
oud
bruin
style
o
i
like
acid
so
this
went
down
way
too
quickly
i
look
forward
to
trying
my
additional
bottles
with
a
bit
of
cellar
age
great
sour
taste
to
start
i
would
rate
this
higher
if
not
for
the
metallic
aftertaste
i
will
admit
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
i
have
tried
so
maybe
i
am
just
being
naive
here

quite
as
rich
as
the
aroma
and
is
dominated
by
the
tartness
of
both
the
wild
yeast
and
carbonic
tang
i
wouldnt
think
that
it
has
a
high
alcohol
but
it
does
have
a
pronounced
boozy
warmth
nice
beer
would
be
great
to
cook
with
too
o
this
beer
has
steadily
grown
on
me
since
my
first
bottle
back
in
july
not
in
the
same
class
as
the
wild
sour
ale
from
last
summer
but
still
really
good
i
think
a
little
age
will
help
too
in
any
case
im
pretty
stoked
about
whats
in
the
works
in
that
wild
fruit
cave
serving
type
bottle
the
taste
started
out
okay
for
the
style
but
the
finish
was
all
copper
tasted
lik
pennies
in
my
mouth
just
ruined
it
for
me
thanks
wibeerman
for
the

gotta
love

one
of
the
creamiest
most
dense
ive
seen

floral

flavor
delivers
on
that
promise
with

and
a
lactic
bite
carrying
into
a
dry

a

get
to
be
o
since
this
improves
with

ill
give
it
a
4
othis
is
a
thumbprint
series
and
i
always
search
for
new
ones
on
my
beer
adventures
despite
the
price
of
a
four
pack
i
will
buy
this
one
again
i
like
the
tartness
and
dryness
it
has
a
sweetness
to
it
drink
fresh
support
your
local
breweries
creamy
throughout
the
finish
comes
way
of
malt
richness
that
imposes
over
that
of
dryness
or
souring
agents
even
for
the
reserved
brown
ale
the
tang
found
here
is
incredibly
soft
an
unfailing
choice
for
those
seeking
favor
in
the
sour
ale
families
overall
for
all
the
hype
i
am
a
little
disappointed
the
metallic
taste
keeps
this
from
being
a
really
good
beer
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
bruin
good
mix
of
fruit
notes
and
spices
kind
of
like
a
cross
between
a
dubbel
and
sour
ale
o
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
ive
tried
and
im
glad
i
bought
a
second
one
to
hold
on
to
for
a
bit
o
i
love
it
super
excited
this
is
going
to
be
the
base
of
most
fruit
beers
the
slight
sweetness
will
blend
great
with
any
added
fruit
being
a
home
brewer
myself
i
wish
i
could
come
up
with
such
a
great
base
beer
to
add
all
kinds
of
goodies
to
great
job
dan
overall
i
cant
claim
to
know
much
about
sour
ales
but
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
hit
the
categorical
marks
it
any
event
the
flavors
a
little
onenote
and
a
little
thin
overall
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
group
who
really
liked
this
light
flavorful
and
drinkable
sour
beer
o
not
one
of
ngs
better
sour
efforts
but
still
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
will
likely
be
buying
berliner
weisse
until
it
is
gone
instead
of
oud
bruin
if
i
am
looking
for
a
ng
sour
fix
o
definitely
on
the
milder
side
aciditywise
for
an
oud
bruin
which
makes
it
very
drinkable
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
acetic
action
here
but
this
is
pretty
nice
o
glad
to
see
the
wild
fruit
cave
making
an
appearance
in
new
glarus
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
thought
it
was
very
drinkable
but
i
didnt
taste
or
smell
the
complexity
yet
ill
wait
a
few
months
before
i
try
my
next
one
and
see
how
its
evolving
glad
i
bought
enough
of
these
to
try
one
every
few
months
over
the
next
couple
of
years
prost
pours
a
deep
brown
with
decent
clarity
and
generous
whitish
tan
head
plenty
of
lacing
involved
the
nose
starts
with
some
green
apple
and
some
wild
components
some
tangy
lacto
character
along
with
rich
malts
which
bring
on
some
mild
woodiness
and
a
hint
of
caramel
some
faint
cherry
in
the
background
as
well
this
brew
isnt
very
aromatic
the
nose
is
quite
delicate
taste
is
fruity
up
front
with
more
green
apple
and
cherry
with
hints
towards
tartness
but
no
real
sour
bite
the
fruit
character
gives
way
to
a
pretty
complex
malt
bill
the
finish
throws
me
off
a
bit
i
dont
want
to
call
it
metallic
but
it
seems
to
head
in
that
direction
something
just
isnt
jiving
on
the
finish
hopefully
this
is
something
that
could
develop
with
age
into
a
cleaner
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
mild
carbonation
for
the
style
overall
i
was
really
hoping
for
better
things
with
this
brew
this
beer
is
still
a
great
value
but
it
just
is
a
little
on
the
mild
side
pours
a
deep
unfiltered
brownish
copper
hue
with
a
fat
tan
head
that
lingers
with
massive
amounts
of
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
fruity
and
slightly
acetic
flavor
is
rich
and
malty
up
front
giving
way
to
tart
grapes
and
wonderful
woody
flavors
that
linger
on
the
palate
with
nice
mouth
puckering
sourness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
extremely
dry
and
effervescent
overall
delicious
summer
time
beer
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
definitely
better
as
it
warms
and
opens
up
a
bit
could
see
this
cellaring
well
this
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
fizzy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
malty
and
slightly
sour
the
taste
is
slightly
sour
and
complex
with
flavors
the
after
taste
leaves
a
lingering
sour
apple
flavor
a
rather
tasty
and
unique
brew
as
is
everything
that
new
glarus
makes
i
have
to
say
im
pretty
disappointed
in
this
newest
offering
from
new
glarus
its
in
no
way
bad
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
good
just
mild
beyond
recognition
the
finish
is
nearly
nonexistent
i
had
very
high
hopes
for
this
beer
especially
considering
its
the
first
release
from
their
fruit
cave
i
assume
theyre
just
working
out
the
kinks
into
the
basement
the
rest
of
these
go
for
sometime
down
the
line
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
both
tart
and
sweet
it
starts
out
with
soft
toffee
notes
and
finishes
with
a
malty
backbone
which
includes
wisconsin
british
and
german
malts
it
is
spontaneously
fermented
on
oak
in
the
cave
and
contains
hallertau
hops
the
hops
and
malts
elegantly
support
sparkling
fruit
notes
that
end
with
a
smooth
oaky
finish
i
do
prefer
both
enigma
and
wild
sour
ale
but
beating
those
two
would
be
damn
near
impossible
o
the
beer
is
full
of
subtle
nuances
and
great
flavors
and
still
very
refreshing
not
super
sour
so
it
may
not
get
the
fan
fair
but
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
i
like
it
but
im
curious
how
itll
taste
with
a
little
age
to
it
o
a
very
nice
oud
bruin
style
that
i
will
have
difficulty
in
not
consuming
my
entire
case
as
i
want
to
see
how
these
develop
in
the
bottle
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
based
on
what
i
read
in
the
octb
this
beer
seems
to
have
been
brewed
exactly
to
style
however
i
would
really
have
loved
for
this
to
be
a
bit
more
sour
i
was
hoping
it
would
evolve
into
a
more
sour
brew
over
time
but
that
hope
was
dashed
when
i
learned
the
beer
had
been
flash
pasteurized
although
this
beer
is
certainly
decent
it
makes
me
a
bit
nervous
to
think
that
this
may
be
the
base
for
all
the
fruited
sours
coming
out
of
the
wild
sour
cave
i
was
expecting
another
home
run
and
instead
i
would
say
this
is
a
solid
double
this
is
very
interesting
i
was
sort
of
expecting
a
crisp
refreshing
bright
sour
like
wild
sour
but
this
is
different
this
isnt
mostly
tart
sourness
delight
its
sourness
on
top
of
malt
on
top
of
floral
hops
blended
with
oak
this
is
masterfully
done
and
to
say
its
complex
is
an
understatement
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
one
ages
overall
another
outstanding
example
from
new
glarus
love
how
an
outstanding
beer
like
this
is
easily
accessible
in
wisconsin
oud
bruin
49
overall
kind
of
a
precious
beer
sour
on
the
nose
sweet
sour
and
bitter
on
the
palate
the
process
for
making
this
amazes
me
open
resting
in
the
coolship
followed
by
spontaneous
fermentation
in
oak
barrels
an
amazing
array
of
flavors
from
such
a
simple
process
does
mellow
as
it
warms
will
definitely
buy
more
to
both
enjoy
fresh
on
cool
summer
nights
and
age
for
a
few
years
this
will
probably
taste
great
around
christmas
time
o
pretty
good
complex
on
the
nose
and
palate
but
the
finish
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
id
say
its
kind
of
what
id
imagine
a
sweeter
rodenbach
to
taste
like
though
i
cant
say
for
sure
since
i
dont
have
a
bottle
to
open
sidebyside
right
now
still
id
have
to
say
i
definitely
prefer
enigma
and
wild
sour
ale
to
this
one
o
great
job
dan
carey
and
team
congratulations
on
making
yet
another
great
beer
and
on
the
great
addition
to
your
brewery
o
new
glarus
continues
to
impress
with
its
sour
program
creating
a
belgianstyle
oud
bruin
that
mimics
some
of
the
classics
almost
to
a
t
malt
forward
this
brew
has
a
light
sweetness
carrying
through
the
whole
flavor
profile
thats
perfectly
cut
by
the
delicate
tartness
this
style
is
known
for
dark
fruits
oak
barrel
and
distressed
leather
give
the
beer
deep
complexity
while
its
lighter
body
makes
for
an
easily
drinkable
brew
that
can
be
explored
pint
after
pint
the
flavor
complexity
really
sets
this
beer
apart
i
enjoy
new
glarus
brews
when
im
able
to
enjoy
in
sf
this
exceeded
expectations
cheers
cherries
red
wine
tobacco
vanilla
leather
and
vinegar
everything
i
want
in
the
style
tannic
as
all
hell
maybe
slightly
under
carbonated
but
a
fantastic
flanders
really
everything
i
want
in
the
style
and
impossible
to
beat
for
the
price
new
glarus
continues
to
impress
exactly
what
i
have
been
looking
for
at
10
a
4
pack
this
is
a
steel
new
glarus
nails
it
again
o
very
nice
flaunders
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
smells
a
bit
sour
and
like
the
filling
from
a
mcdonalds
apple
pie
tastes
a
bit
tart
maybe
some
cherry
and
spices
interesting
to
say
the
least
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
8oz
of
this
a
nice
flanders
i
enjoy
the
wood
and
plum
flavors
decent
amount
of
tart
but
not
over
the
top
o
i
really
like
this
beer
new
glarus
continues
to
impress
but
this
is
so
different
than
the
rest
of
their
sours
incredibly
complex
all
kinds
of
flavors
and
smells
in
every
sip
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
ill
be
asking
my
buddy
in
wi
for
a
few
more
6ers
of
this
a
nicely
well
done
and
highly
enjoyable
sour
my
first
new
glarus
beer
and
it
was
a
treat
still
feeling
out
sours
ive
had
some
good
ones
and
some
mediocre
ones
i
think
this
is
a
good
one
the
name
enigma
describes
this
beer
nicely
there
are
things
i
like
about
it
and
things
i
dont
like
it
toes
a
good
balance
between
sweet
and
sour
and
has
lots
of
nice
fruity
notes
but
im
not
crazy
about
the
way
the
acidity
gets
all
goofy
and
yogurtlike
on
the
back
of
the
palate
still
highly
enjoyable
stuff
that
is
definitely
worth
a
visit
best
new
glarus
ive
had
in
a
while
really
tasty
pretty
damn
spectacular
id
be
buying
cases
of
this
beer
to
cellar
if
i
had
access
overall
decidedly
tasty
would
repeat
frequently
if
i
were
nearer
the
wisconsin
border
which
i
may
be
fairly
soon
so
ive
things
to
look
forward
to
pours
from
the
bottle
a
dark
red
with
a
minimal
head
that
fades
fast
it
smells
of
red
fruit
tannins
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
similar
tart
cherries
strawberries
vanilla
its
slightly
sour
but
the
caramel
malts
provide
an
excellent
balance
medium
light
mouth
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
ive
never
tried
any
of
the
earlier
editions
of
enigma
but
this
is
very
tasty
this
was
fantastic
really
drinkable
especially
for
the
style
very
tart
and
crisp
if
available
i
would
drink
this
often
i
liked
this
a
lot
better
than
their
ohd
bruin
sorry
not
my
kind
of
beer
i
tried
it
two
different
times
just
not
for
me
an
excellent
brew
the
sour
leans
towards
puckering
but
a
sweet
malt
backing
adds
sweetness
and
complexity
very
wellbalanced
robust
and
delicious
not
that
sour
lots
of
cherries
and
some
vanilla
on
tap
at
greenbush
bar
last
night
great
pizza
btw
smells
like
a
musty
dusty
room
flavor
doesnt
follow
its
tart
but
not
too
tart
and
delish
drank
16
oz
on
tap
some
cherry
oak
and
vanilla
great
beer
telma
taste
like
a
sour
belgian
red
i
dont
normally
like
cherryflavored
things
but
this
has
a
really
nice
taste
to
it
refreshing
and
fruity
like
their
fruit
beers
tend
to
be
but
with
a
subtle
bit
of
sour
as
well
i
felt
like
i
got
some
hop
flavor
in
the
beer
too
but
i
wasnt
sure
either
way
the
beer
is
certainly
an
enigma
as
the
overall
profile
is
interesting
and
complex
as
usual
great
job
by
dan
and
co
pours
a
ruby
red
with
lacing
head
smell
is
red
wine
vinegar
with
sharp
cherry
notes
taste
is
lighter
than
expected
when
compared
to
the
strong
nose
cherry
vanilla
up
front
with
rhubarb
tart
finish
carbonation
lasts
throughout
very
well
balanced
a
nice
bruin
style
from
new
glarus
wow
this
is
a
looot
different
than
the
last
batch
this
one
has
way
stronger
notes
of
oak
the
complexity
is
absolutely
stunning
its
like
wisconsin
red
at
one
point
but
then
its
like
im
chewing
on
a
piece
of
oak
and
the
brown
ale
still
peaks
through
from
time
to
time
just
an
absolute
joy
and
pleasure
to
experience
oak
vanilla
cherry
red
sour
delicious
yes
i
know
thats
not
scientific
enough
but
sometimes
you
just
drink
a
beer
and
say
that
was
fucking
awesome
this
is
one
of
those
beers
if
you
dont
at
least
love
this
beer
your
tongue
is
missing
strong
vinegar
notes
in
the
taste
and
aroma
cherry
cider
vinegar
to
be
more
specific
i
expect
some
vinegar
characteristics
in
a
sour
but
this
is
beyond
that
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
sour
good
mix
of
tart
fruit
and
oaky
notes
with
a
nice
smokey
edge
this
beer
is
excellent
incredibly
tasty
i
am
biased
because
i
enjoy
sour
things
but
it
is
definitely
not
too
sour
to
turn
off
the
uninitiated
incredible
balance
and
flavor
another
stellar
sour
from
ng
the
hype
is
definitely
worth
it
proud
to
have
it
only
here
and
happy
to
send
it
out
elsewhere
so
you
can
see
what
were
taking
about
o
very
one
of
a
kind
flavored
beer
the
funky
character
was
a
hard
one
to
describe
because
it
didnt
fall
in
the
normal
flavor
spectrum
as
the
brett
funk
descriptors
or
the
sour
bacteria
descriptors
overall
enigma
is
very
enjoyable
but
between
this
and
ng
oud
bruin
i
think
i
prefer
oud
bruin
quick
intense
flavor
followed
by
tart
aftertast
holy
hell
is
this
good
fell
in
love
with
cranbic
but
i
might
just
like
this
better
poured
dark
brown
with
a
red
hue
bready
sour
cherry
aroma
has
that
light
musty
lambic
note
taste
is
huge
cherry
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
caramel
good
sour
bite
but
balanced
well
by
the
sweet
bread
yeast
taste
amazing
this
is
a
good
sour
i
like
the
separation
from
the
flanders
red
but
enjoy
that
other
style
a
little
more
thumbprint
enigma
which
i
believe
was
2012
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
slightly
hazed
blood
amber
coloring
with
a
sparse
film
of
head
on
the
pour
that
quickly
clears
up
aromas
of
tart
cherry
and
grape
chardonnay
notes
rose
petals
subtle
vanilla
cream
berry
sweet
woody
spice
and
some
earthy
highlights
very
well
balanced
nose
flavors
are
a
blast
of
tart
and
sour
fruit
forward
with
cherry
grape
must
and
a
berry
blend
with
white
wine
dryness
and
bite
some
woody
notes
subtle
char
and
hints
of
crème
extremely
smooth
dry
bodied
throughout
with
a
tart
slightly
sour
cherry
and
berry
blend
aftertaste
the
finish
is
crisp
clean
and
dry
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
i
love
this
beer
new
glarus
makes
wicked
good
beer
in
particular
sour
ales
when
in
wi
drink
indigenous
drink
new
glarus
really
nice
blend
of
cherry
and
oak
almost
more
kriek
charachter
than
flanders
but
the
beer
i
tried
had
about
2
years
of
age
on
it
so
may
be
some
development
at
play
there
new
glarus
rarely
disappoints
overy
enjoyable
easy
drinking
and
quite
flavorful
overall
i
found
this
beer
new
and
exciting
and
very
tasty
making
me
want
to
explore
more
in
the
flanders
oud
bruin
style
as
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
beers
that
ive
had
all
year
i
dont
know
much
about
this
style
and
hope
that
this
is
not
the
apex
since
this
new
glarus
brew
was
so
damn
enjoyable
that
i
will
seek
out
more
like
this
an
outstanding
beer
drinking
experience
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
to
drink
and
see
and
hear
yes
hear
o
another
great
beer
from
new
glarus
nice
beer
though
better
when
fresh
a
amazing
beer
never
understood
why
this
was
not
more
sought
after
with
all
the
craziness
with
wild
sour
ale
i
have
been
doing
my
best
to
keep
my
last
couple
bottles
out
of
the
case
i
had
until
dan
brewed
it
again
god
i
hope
that
is
soon
i
also
hope
it
sticks
around
longer
then
wsa
it
is
better
and
i
hope
i
am
the
only
one
who
knows
it
oanother
fruity
sour
treasure
from
new
glarus
flavorful
easy
to
drink
and
well
crafted
bottle
from
trade
thanks
my
first
new
glarus
pours
a
deep
clear
reddish
pink
with
a
small
head
that
recedes
quickly
aroma
is
light
cherries
some
sour
vinegar
and
a
bit
of
caramel
vanilla
slick
mouthfeel
and
tastes
like
cherries
vanilla
wood
and
some
apple
maybe
a
hint
of
ginger
and
cinnamon
but
not
spice
by
any
means
thr
vanilla
in
the
sour
makes
this
one
somewhat
sweet
high
carbonation
keeps
it
very
drinkable
very
unique
brew
and
a
winner
for
sure
the
beer
is
interesting
and
complex
yet
not
so
sour
that
it
is
undrinkable
i
find
it
to
be
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
found
any
bottles
of
it
floating
around
overall
sour
cherry
pie
is
the
best
descriptor
i
can
come
up
with
i
love
cherry
pie
and
krieks
so
you
shouldnt
be
surprised
that
i
always
have
enjoyed
this
beer
that
being
said
i
would
like
this
to
be
more
sour
but
luckily
ng
has
the
wild
sour
ale
to
satisfy
that
particular
craving
so
enigma
definitely
holds
up
well
even
a
year
later
highly
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
sours
and
fruit
beers
because
this
is
an
awesome
combination
of
both
i
wish
i
had
bought
even
more
of
this
beer
when
it
came
out
i
will
have
to
await
the
next
release
of
this
beer
if
there
is
indeed
one
another
great
beer
from
new
glarus
and
something
that
i
could
probably
drink
gallons
of
without
getting
sick
of
it
or
too
inebriated
for
that
matter
its
not
quite
as
tart
and
layered
as
some
of
my
favorite
flanders
sours
like
the
ones
previously
mentioned
rather
it
comes
across
as
a
mildlytart
fruit
beer
no
matter
though
as
its
still
a
well
executed
and
tasty
beer
nonetheless
overall
super
impressed
with
this
beer
would
absolutely
seek
this
out
and
would
love
to
drink
this
regularly
mouthfeel
is
good
decent
carbonation
dry
finish
overall
i
am
just
getting
into
the
sour
world
have
had
some
of
the
big
guns
at
a
tasting
and
this
is
a
great
introduction
to
the
sours
i
wish
i
did
have
more
of
this
beer
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
just
not
a
homerun
an
interesting
americanized
version
of
this
style
it
pours
a
bright
shining
orange
amber
color
with
a
milkshake
head
in
khaki
hue
the
nose
is
a
lot
of
fruit
for
the
genre
dried
cranberries
cherries
figs
pears
very
strange
the
sweetness
from
that
runs
into
a
sour
wall
of
yeasty
and
bacterial
fermentation
which
is
almost
sharp
in
the
nose
flavor
wise
the
first
thing
i
detect
is
the
ridiculously
high
sugar
content
here
this
beer
is
downright
sweet
its
a
funny
trait
to
have
in
a
sour
beer
but
its
there
alright
the
sour
is
a
hyper
acidic
peroxide
feeling
intense
front
of
tongue
type
that
is
not
entirely
compatible
with
the
fruit
flavors
everyone
in
our
crowd
thought
this
beer
was
incredible
i
wasnt
quite
so
compelled
for
that
reason
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
the
sugar
content
is
cloying
and
frustratingly
sickening
even
half
a
bottle
of
this
is
too
much
for
me
the
sour
leaves
a
sour
patch
kids
burn
on
the
tastebuds
and
roof
of
my
mouth
and
its
just
out
of
sync
somehow
good
carbonation
though
and
a
body
that
would
be
right
on
if
not
for
the
sugar
overall
its
a
challenging
brew
for
me
a
staple
characteristic
of
this
whole
series
from
new
glarus
and
although
its
well
made
its
not
something
i
intend
to
revisit
more
of
a
personal
thing
though
and
i
suggest
this
to
any
sour
fan
or
new
glarus
fan
more
generally
on
a
side
note
this
reminds
me
of
the
flanders
fred
which
was
a
much
anticipated
but
underwhelming
brew
similar
flavor
profile
and
storyline
here
overall
absolutely
floored
by
this
one
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
ever
had
this
has
to
be
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
new
glarus
and
that
is
saying
a
lot
because
dan
carey
really
brews
up
some
masterpieces
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sours
do
what
you
can
to
get
your
hands
on
this
one
amazing
stuff
share
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
color
is
amber
red
filtered
and
clear
smell
is
of
apples
slight
oak
i
was
expecting
more
cherries
mouthfeel
was
good
clean
acidic
almost
a
sweet
apple
cider
vinegar
above
average
overall
i
would
try
it
again
but
would
not
seek
it
out
o
i
like
it
its
a
bit
sweet
for
me
not
a
light
sour
summer
drink
great
autumn
beer
had
some
mulling
spice
on
hand
to
compare
and
its
definitely
hidden
in
there
between
the
sweet
apple
and
sour
finish
i
like
it
my
gf
loves
it
b
d
though
i
actually
prefer
a
more
sour
beer
this
is
still
a
good
offering
definitely
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
sours
it
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
to
make
it
truly
great
but
its
another
high
quality
beer
from
new
glarus
o
overall
a
damn
tasty
beer
glad
i
have
a
few
more
of
these
i
would
love
to
try
and
make
a
dessert
with
this
maybe
some
mochi
filling
i
love
these
fresh
i
love
them
with
some
age
on
them
it
is
so
hard
to
age
these
though
you
always
find
an
excuse
hey
weve
been
replacing
a
sewer
line
this
calls
for
an
enigma
its
really
a
glowing
rubycopper
just
a
hint
of
light
orange
around
the
edges
smells
of
mulled
cherry
cider
cinnamon
stick
clove
cherry
baked
apple
acetic
acid
and
cranberry
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
the
flavor
is
a
bit
less
complex
cherry
pie
and
a
slight
malt
vinegar
bite
itd
be
a
perfect
combination
with
a
rich
sausage
dish
or
a
creambased
dessert
i
wouldnt
mind
if
it
was
a
bit
more
sour
or
picked
up
some
funkiness
time
will
tell
as
it
feels
like
it
doesnt
really
get
the
back
of
the
tongue
quite
how
id
want
it
to
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
spoton
for
a
nice
light
fruited
sour
overall
its
quite
nice
not
mindblowing
for
the
style
but
just
what
i
would
expect
from
ng
an
incredibly
approachable
beer
that
hits
the
style
with
all
the
right
notes
while
still
keeping
it
accessible
by
striving
for
balance
o
really
nice
beer
that
i
am
enjoying
all
the
way
through
well
done
new
glarus
o
this
is
a
dam
nice
beer
treat
i
wish
i
had
about
another
dozen
of
these
overall
a
really
surprisingly
complex
and
refreshing
sour
ale
that
does
an
outstanding
job
of
showcasing
the
cherry
notes
i
really
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
but
it
does
a
great
job
of
taking
a
really
nice
fruit
and
using
it
to
enhance
an
already
tasty
sour
brown
definitely
would
love
to
try
this
again
hard
to
believe
they
sell
this
in
four
packs
considering
the
quality
o
very
solid
the
base
beer
was
definitely
evident
which
i
appreciated
also
enjoyed
the
complexity
of
the
fruit
basket
that
they
packed
in
definitely
not
just
boozy
fruit
juice
but
a
wellcrafted
fruit
beer
o
very
enjoyable
and
well
made
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
cherry
beers
but
this
very
nice
this
is
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
from
new
glarus
and
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
the
big
picture
i
am
often
tempted
to
buy
a
case
of
this
one
when
new
glarus
releases
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
snifter
the
beer
was
a
pinkish
red
color
it
reminded
me
a
little
of
cherry
7up
in
appearance
the
smell
was
tart
cherries
and
vanilla
almost
smelling
like
desert
while
the
aroma
might
make
a
drinker
think
of
a
sour
this
is
not
classified
as
a
sour
tart
cherries
dominate
the
initial
taste
with
vanilla
in
the
background
the
cherries
dominate
the
taste
in
this
one
but
that
is
a
good
thing
this
is
not
an
artificial
or
candylike
cherry
but
a
pleasant
tart
cherry
the
wood
aging
lends
itself
nicely
to
the
vanilla
notes
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
shows
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
as
one
might
expect
from
a
fruit
beer
the
unique
characteristics
of
this
beer
truly
make
it
an
enigma
the
cherries
coupled
with
the
wood
casks
make
for
a
unique
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
even
noncraft
beer
drinkers
o
a
great
fruit
beer
lots
of
tart
and
some
sour
the
fresh
oak
casks
really
pull
everything
together
and
makes
it
more
complex
a
good
fruit
beer
though
nothing
particularly
mind
blowing
pours
a
deep
crystal
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
a
good
sized
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
on
the
top
smells
of
light
caramel
and
brown
sugar
with
a
cherry
fruity
tartness
underneath
the
flavor
is
mildly
tart
with
a
hint
of
funk
cherries
and
bits
of
lemons
theres
a
solid
base
of
sweet
and
brown
sugar
that
provides
a
great
balance
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
tart
lightly
tongue
piercing
mouthfeel
this
one
leans
a
bit
towards
the
sweet
side
of
sour
ale
but
i
think
its
a
really
well
made
beer
i
enjoyed
it
o
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
especially
as
it
warms
up
ive
had
a
few
beers
from
new
glarus
now
and
theyve
all
been
stellar
but
this
one
just
might
be
the
best
ive
had
so
complexwhat
a
beautiful
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
any
fan
of
sours
superb
stuff
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
probably
not
something
i
would
buy
a
lot
of
if
i
had
access
to
it
but
rather
good
and
im
certainly
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
i
give
this
4
red
lightsabers
and
2
green
lightsabers
all
in
all
enjoyable
and
drinkable
this
one
crosses
some
borders
with
distinct
sour
notes
distinct
woodsy
funk
and
some
definite
fruit
i
like
it
do
i
love
it
not
really
would
i
drink
another
bottle
definitely
cheers
drink
this
was
tasty
and
very
flavorful
again
ng
does
some
amazing
things
with
fruit
beers
and
this
was
no
exception
id
love
to
take
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
i
could
a
very
mellow
mildly
sour
fruit
beer
i
like
this
its
more
to
the
wild
side
than
their
normal
fruit
beers
but
short
of
a
fullon
sour
id
like
it
better
without
that
syrupy
sweetness
which
would
let
the
two
main
components
come
through
more
clearly
overall
sour
brown
with
a
little
spice
no
complaints
here
nice
stuff
and
quite
aproachable
i
would
love
to
try
more
from
these
guys
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
glass
it
pours
a
copper
color
with
little
to
no
head
it
smells
of
cherry
and
sweet
fruits
with
a
slight
oak
scent
coming
through
it
tastes
tart
yet
sweet
almost
like
a
dry
wine
or
cider
the
beer
maintains
a
nice
carbonation
all
the
way
through
but
still
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
overall
another
fantastic
product
from
new
glarus
easily
drinkable
and
a
must
have
serving
type
bottle
bought
from
the
new
glarus
bottle
shop
attached
to
the
brewery
overall
outstanding
and
very
impressive
another
great
offering
from
new
glarus
o
good
riddle
me
this
batman
how
does
a
brewery
make
consistently
delicious
fruit
beers
seriously
this
isnt
even
a
riddle
i
just
dont
know
the
answer
id
highly
recommend
searching
for
this
if
you
are
into
sours
or
fruit
beers
new
glarus
has
once
again
worked
magic
in
this
style
makes
me
glad
i
still
have
2
more
shared
these
2
and
a
bottle
of
serendipity
to
get
into
cheers
after
this
and
every
other
beer
i
have
sampled
so
far
from
new
glarus
it
looks
like
i
will
be
driving
back
to
wisconsin
sooner
than
later
o
tastes
like
a
slightly
tart
version
of
belgian
red
which
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
meh
still
delicious
competence
is
both
competent
and
delicious
and
i
cannot
in
good
conscious
give
this
anything
less
than
a
good
score
o
very
complex
and
layered
hard
to
pin
down
everything
that
is
going
on
here
o
i
like
this
more
than
belgian
red
or
rasp
tart
eek
cheers
guys
o
me
likey
wish
i
had
more
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
low
to
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
could
be
more
carbonated
without
illeffect
the
result
is
a
beer
with
fairly
placid
tendencies
that
are
relieved
by
the
tartness
which
moves
this
along
the
palate
quite
nicely
in
the
end
closes
dry
with
lingering
acidity
in
the
back
of
the
throat
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
vibrant
red
color
beautiful
clarity
also
the
head
was
white
and
fizzy
no
lacing
or
retention
the
smell
reminds
me
of
cola
with
hints
of
cherry
on
the
nose
too
the
smell
is
just
very
impressive
to
me
the
taste
is
also
impressive
its
got
a
blast
of
tart
cherry
and
citrus
upfront
that
fades
into
vanilla
and
some
smokey
oak
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
its
thin
like
wine
but
also
dry
overall
im
really
impressed
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
lots
of
great
aromas
and
flavors
in
this
beer
and
its
not
insanely
sour
which
i
love
this
a
gem
in
my
opinion
never
expected
to
like
this
as
much
as
i
did
o
i
had
mixed
feelings
about
this
beer
it
was
very
interesting
and
definitely
big
on
aroma
and
flavor
however
i
felt
like
the
cherries
were
a
little
bit
too
overpowering
and
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
i
disliked
it
i
would
recommend
trying
it
out
but
personally
its
not
something
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
one
a
highly
recommend
its
very
complex
easy
to
drink
and
very
tasty
despite
it
being
a
fruit
beer
and
primarily
dominated
by
cherries
you
could
have
a
couple
very
interesting
sour
the
slight
sweet
vanilla
notes
are
nice
and
interesting
note
expected
at
all
but
they
compliment
the
tartness
very
well
nice
and
dry
finish
o
its
a
very
unique
beer
and
another
great
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
glad
i
picked
up
this
growler
i
love
these
tart
sour
beers
and
the
creativity
going
into
them
o
overlal
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
would
order
it
again
and
will
be
sad
when
i
finish
this
growler
overall
a
very
interesting
i
am
enjoying
fruit
vanilla
and
sour
all
meld
together
to
form
something
unusual
and
enjoyable
this
one
impressed
me
nicely
done
o
as
someone
who
is
lukewarm
on
wild
ales
but
loves
wisconsin
belgian
red
this
one
was
a
perfect
balance
of
the
base
beer
flavours
witih
the
wild
yeast
a
truly
unique
and
amazing
beer

overall
a
wonderful
sour
brown
that
im
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
pours
a
light
bodied
cherries
amber
in
color
with
a
light
lacing
that
quickly
disappeared
the
nose
is
very
sweet
and
lightly
tart
it
has
a
lot
of
fruit
character
and
having
had
a
lot
of
their
other
fruit
beers
smells
like
a
cuvée
the
flavors
are
of
sweet
cranberry
sweet
apple
slight
fruity
tartness
light
buttered
apple
and
light
acidity
its
a
lot
sweeter
than
i
thought
it
would
be
going
into
this
one
blind
it
really
does
taste
like
a
blend
of
cranbic
apple
ale
and
raspberry
tart
it
drinks
light
and
has
plenty
of
flavor
overall
this
is
a
nice
fruit
beer
once
again
by
new
glarus
but
i
think
i
prefer
the
aforementioned
beers
more
picked
this
up
in
a
fourpack
during
there
annual
oktoberfest
celebrations
reddishbrown
ruby
hues
sink
deep
in
my
brandy
snifter
immediately
im
hit
with
a
sour
oak
flavor
leading
into
a
deep
warm
burn
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
this
beer
tastes
wonderful
unlike
anything
ive
ever
tried
before
enigma
is
carbonatedalmost
champagne
in
mouthfeel
overall
while
the
appearance
is
not
overwhelming
and
the
aroma
is
simple
the
flavors
and
drinkability
of
enigma
more
than
make
up
for
these
slight
shortcomings
this
has
all
the
great
qualities
new
glarus
has
conditioned
us
drinkers
to
expect
from
their
forays
into
fruit
beer
brewing
distilled
down
to
simplest
terms
this
beers
finest
quality
is
a
very
personal
one
everything
about
it
evokes
memories
of
autumns
past
this
was
truly
the
perfect
time
to
release
this
delicious
beer
and
it
would
make
an
excellent
addition
to
both
the
new
glarus
seasonal
release
calendar
and
a
refrigerator
near
you
1720
o
this
beer
is
likely
a
lot
more
complex
than
ive
been
able
to
convey
in
this
review
what
i
do
know
is
that
it
was
really
friggin
good
glad
to
recommend
this
brew
o
for
being
such
a
young
beer
this
beer
really
had
a
zip
to
its
sourness
i
loved
the
chocolate
malts
hiding
within
its
aroma
good
feel
to
it
but
flavor
wise
it
was
already
onesided
very
red
color
looks
appealing
but
lacked
a
substantial
head
o
i
love
this
beer
its
sweet
and
sour
and
refreshing
id
love
to
have
this
beer
any
day
of
the
week
any
week
of
the
year
another
fruit
beer
hit
from
new
glarus
thank
goodness
i
work
for
a
beer
restaurant
that
has
access
to
multiple
cases
of
this
because
i
will
be
drinking
it
many
more
times
will
also
set
aside
a
few
bottles
to
experiment
with
aging
o
pretty
decent
beer
but
i
could
skip
it
in
the
future
still
very
glad
i
tried
it
and
10
per
4pack
in
madison
is
not
a
bad
price
at
all
for
this
if
you
like
fruit
beers
its
great
edit
tried
a
much
fresher
bottle
and
this
tasted
like
a
different
beer
more
like
a
slightly
sour
belgian
red
enjoyed
this
much
more
and
updated
score
to
reflect
the
newer
vintage
thanks
for
bringing
this
one
back
i
might
be
fighting
my
wife
for
the
last
two
bottles
yeah
its
pretty
awesome
guys
the
sour
ale
is
not
a
widely
made
beer
but
when
its
done
well
its
delicious
overall
this
is
good
beginner
level
sour
ale
as
there
are
far
stronger
sours
on
the
market
being
a
90s
kid
sours
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart
as
they
remind
me
of
a
sour
apple
warhead
that
was
so
popular
when
i
was
a
kid
smooth
refreshing
and
delicious
makes
this
beer
a
must
try
before
its
gone
o
another
great
beer
in
the
ng
fruit
beer
lineup
great
nuances
of
flavor
really
bring
home
a
full
experience
of
eating
a
piece
of
cherry
pie

many
thanks
to
tim
and
david
for
muling
this
one
back
from
wisconsin
for
me
poured
from
bottle
into
boulevard
farmhouseflute
glass
pours
a
crystal
clear
raspberry
red
color
with
absolutely
no
head
a
little
odd
appearance
i
can
tell
that
this
is
carbonated
though
bubbles
are
coming
up
from
the
bottom
not
giving
it
a
great
grade
for
appearance
smell
leathery
and
rosy
i
also
get
cinnamon
in
the
nose
a
little
unexpected
i
like
the
aroma
though
taste
tart
cherries
strawberry
secondary
cinnamon
on
the
front
of
the
palate
finished
by
a
nice
sweet
strawberry
finish
the
play
between
the
fruit
and
the
spice
is
very
subtle
works
great
together
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
tight
the
finish
is
dry
this
is
a
very
unique
and
interesting
sour
ale
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
how
this
one
develops
over
time
overall
new
glarus
has
mastered
the
art
of
brewing
worldclass
fruit
ales
from
the
apple
beer
to
their
raspberry
and
finally
the
top
ranked
begian
red
these
are
all
treats
to
seek
out
and
savor
o
another
fantastic
brew
by
new
glarus
this
is
a
great
late
night
fall
drink
to
have
around
a
fire
just
fantastic
o
great
fruit
in
this
one
with
tons
of
apples
the
funkiness
is
quite
good
and
well
rounded
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
too
much
of
this
but
could
see
it
being
a
hit
with
those
that
dont
like
beer
an
incredible
and
damn
near
perfect
beer
im
rarely
this
excited
about
a
beer
bravo
to
new
glarus
o
this
beer
is
delicious
tastes
just
cherry
pie
i
could
drink
it
all
day
long
need
i
say
any
more
this
beer
is
off
the
charts
overall
just
flat
out
fantastic
prolly
as
good
as
belgian
red
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
thumbprint
beers
ng
has
offered
yet
iipa
might
be
my
only
one
i
like
better
but
its
because
im
a
hop
head
who
loves
ipas
this
is
definitely
more
unique
more
robust
and
a
fantastic
latesummerfall
offering
i
plan
on
picking
up
a
4pack
of
this
just
about
every
time
i
make
a
beer
run
great
job
dandeb
cost
9
99
for
a
four
pack
overall
i
love
the
sweet
and
sour
contrast
of
this
beer
its
properly
named
as
an
enigma
because
this
is
a
really
unique
beer
that
dan
has
brewed
twice
now
i
have
had
a
bottle
of
both
vintages
and
i
remember
this
beer
to
be
as
good
the
first
go
around
as
it
is
right
now
overall
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
think
it
could
use
some
tweaking
im
hoping
the
newest
batch
that
is
coming
out
soon
will
be
a
little
better
definately
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
be
improved

a
cloudy

with
almost
zero
head
smells
strongly
of
cherries
with
some
vanilla
slight
sourness
and
pleasant
acidity
with
a
lot
of
complexity
great
mouthfeel
crisp
and
easy
drinking
another
very
solid
offering
in
the
unplugged
series
overall
very
tasty
the
only
slight
knocks
i
have
are
because
new
glarus
terms
it
a
sour
brown
ale
its
a
little
light
in
color
and
lacks
the
malty
sweetness
that
is
appropriate
for
the
style
that
said
enigma
is
a
great
beer
pours
out
a
brownishamber
with
a
flashfizzy
head
and
no
real
lacing
but
the
body
is
slightly
more
hefty
than
a
typical
wild
ale
although
the
carbonation
level
is
fizzy
enough
to
pass
for
a
wild
do
my
idea
of
a
good
dessert
beer
every
category
about
this
beer
is
outstanding
besides
appearance
mild
carbonation
that
barely
hits
the
tongue
pretty
easy

finally
get
to
try
something
from
the
heralded
unplugged
series
this
appearance
is
as
you
would
expect
with
any
fruit
beer
there
is
a
slight
haze
to
the
pinkish
body
the
smell
is
mainly
of
raspberries
with
a
hint
of
sour
in
the
background
the
taste
has
the
fruit
characteristics
that
were
seen
in
the
nose
but
there
is
a
heaving
spicing
of
what
appears
to
be
ginger
with
the
strong
tart
flavor
of
the
fruit
im
really
not
a
fan
of
how
this
beer
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
velvety
and
smooth
and
an
all
around
interesting

thanks
to
two
of
the
finest
gents
on
ba
for
the
continuing
supply
of
classic
ng
beers
d

almost

which
is
my
absolute
favorite
nonalcoholic
beverage
drank
enigma
after
eating
sausalito
cookies
macadamia
nuts
milk
chocolate
i
definitely
recommend
this
pairing
md
it
has
a
slight
syrupy
quality
it
isnt
detracting
at
all
but
adds
for
an
interesting
texture
it
does
have
a
rich
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
balances
the
flavors
really
well
i
am
enjoying
their
beers
a
lot
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
with
lower
abv
beers
it
is
just
as
complex
and
drinkable
without

too
artificial
flavoring
in

this
is
a
one
and
done
for
me
overall
another
beer
from
ng
that
i
enjoy
a
lot
the
cherries
are
spot
on
and
provide
a
bit
of
tartness
to
this
refreshing
beer
i
am
really
glad
ng
brought
this
one
back
very
drinkable
new
glarus
makes
great
fruit
beers
surprise
surprise
and
this
is
no
exception
im
not
sure
if
i
like
the
taste
of
this
better
than
the
wi
belgian
red
but
if
not
its
not
far
behind
and
for
a
cheapskate
like
me
buying
this
when
available
is
a
nobrainer
its
40
cheaper
on
a
oz
basis
poured
with
a
medium
sized
light
tan
head
that
settled
out
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
clear
copper
amber
aroma
is
tart
malt
yeast
and
a
bit
of
fruit
flavors
the
same
plus
a
bit
of
cookie
dough
body
is
excellent
and
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
has
long
length
session
beer
in
the
summer
and
right
mood
d
i
would
seek
out
more
to
see
how
it
ages
but
not
a
sour
that
i
would
frequent
di
actually
really
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
sessionable
brew
plenty
of
sweet
cherries
with
a
very
light
addition
of
barrel
aging
the
sourness
is
quite
low
which
allows
this
to
be
extremely
drinkable
not
the
most
interesting
of
beers
but
so
tasty
d
good
drinkability
went
down
easily
a
little
less
cherry
and
a
little
more
acidity
would
make
this
fantastic
lightbodied
with
less
carbonation
than
id
like
finishes
semidry
with
an
acidic
blast
of
vinegar
surprisingly
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
enigma
lives
up
to
its
name
in
terms
of
intriguing
complexity
quite
an
original
drinkability
theres
a
lot
of
commonality
between
this
and
wisconsin
belgian
red
but
theres
an
extra
layer
of
depth
to
it
from
the
oak
barrel
and
the
spontaneous
fermentation
personally
i
wouldve
preferred
more
tartsourwild
elements
but
for
what
it
is
its
quite
good
pours
a
dark
clear
mahoganyruby
red
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
and
is
unretentive
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
oak
and
cherries
but
overall
fairly
light
flavor
and
body
reminds
me
of
cranbic
but
with
sour
cherries
and
is
the
exceptional
high
point
of
the
beer
as
hoped
for
body
has
a
pleasant
vanilla
pumpkin
sugary
spice
tart
fruit
blend
of
flavors
and
a
rather
thick
full
body
with
sharp
carbonation
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
despite
some
of
my
friends
not
being
a
big
fan
of
it
however
this
isnt
anywhere
near
the
level
of
awesome
as
rasp
tart
or
belgian
red
d
a
interesting
beer
with
a
good
balance
of
sweet
sour
and
bitter
however
i
just
cant
get
into
these
damn
fruited
beers
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
ill
stick
with
the
malts
and
hops
flavor
is
nice
its
definitely
tasty
just
a
little
light
therefore
drinkability
is
excelent
mouthfeel
is
a
light
body
and
high
carbonation
fruit
flavors
are
pleasant
a
mild
salad
dressing
like
flavor
resides
but
ironically
its
not
a
bad
thing
overall
a
tasty
beer
ill
definitely
revisit
this
one
if
i
can
its
extremely
interesting
and
unique
yet
maintains
a
userfriendly
aspect
about
it
great
beer
this
review
was
quick
and
brief
but
i
have
another
bottle
of
enigma
that
i
will
use
to
expand
this
review
drinkability
is
phenomenal
i
had
maybe
7
ounces
of
this
beer
and
i
could
have
downed
an
entire
growler
effortlessly
savoring
every
beautiful
sip
fantastic
beer
and
another
huge
thank
you
jeff
you
outdid
yourself
with
this
one
this
one
only
reinforces
what
i
already
believed
dan
carey
is
the
best
brewer
in
the
country
there
are
some
very
close
competitors
vinnie
rr
patrick
the
bruery
comes
very
close
a
few
others
but
no
one
i
know
can
produce
the
variety
of
styles
dan
has
in
such
a
masterful
fashion
from
german
wheats
to
unbelievable
lagers
to
fruit
beers

to

the

up

are
certainly

fine
one
at
that
full
bodied
and
lightly
syrupy
with
perfect
mild
carbonation
a
really
nicely
made
beer
d
a
refreshing
but
not
over
the
top
sour
beer
enjoyable
but
towards
the
end
the
sweetness
got
a
little
too
much
for
me
so
id
stop
after
one
in
a
sitting
would
buy
and
recommend
this
the
taste
lingers
after
drinking
but
its
just
not
like
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
to
me
very
smooth
drink
but
not
my
classic
beer
this
brew
makes
me
salivate
and
go
back
time
and
time
again
for
more
sips
which
makes
it
fairly
drinkable
despite
a
sharpness
about
it
in
the
back
of
the
throat
for
less
than
6
the
alcohol
is
more
evident
than
i
was
expecting
overall
not
bad
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
and
big
thanks
to
younger35
for
making
that
happen
drinkability
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
if
i
can
trade
for
it
a
very
nice
complex
drinkable
tart
beer
kudos
to
new
glarus
2nd
half
of
the
bottle
update
the
acetic
character
seems
to
have
increased
when
the
beer
warmed
toward
room
temperature
and
the
burn
is
somewhat
oppressive
drinkability
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
want
several
of
these
in
a
row
while
im
drinking
it
my
mouth
feels
as
if
its
been
broken
and
ive
been
tasting
this
for
a
while
now
and
just
want
it
to
go
away
but
then
it
does
after
a
couple
of
seconds
and
i
want
some
more
new
glarus
is
now
in
my
top
three
american
breweries
not
a
bad
beer
to
be
seen
anywhere
enigma
is
another
great
example
of
how
masterful
they
are
at
barrel
aging
drinkability
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
a
4
year
old
bottle
of
enigma
at
a
beer
tasting
last
week
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
that
version
of
enigma
and
the
current
one
the
new
version
is
much
more
tart
more
emphasis
on
the
sour
characteristics
and
the
cherry
flavor
i
think
the
older
version
was
more
balanced
not
balanced
in
the
sense
that
the
new
version
doesnt
have
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
but
it
lends
itself
more
towards
the
sour
side
i
liked
both
versions
to
be
honest
though
i
do
like
the
sourness
that
shines
through
on
the
new
one
a
bit
more
d
another
solid
fruity
beer
from
new
glarus
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
would
like
to
have
again
d
highly
drinkable
good
balance
of
sour
and
sweetness
big
flavor
too
just
another
great
one
from
new
glarus
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
really
nice
sour
d
another
winner
from
new
glarus
somehow
they
manage
to
highlight
the
best
fruit
flavors
in
a
beer
and
bring
them
all
center
stage
i
am
consistently
impressed
with
the
fruit
beers
that
ng
puts
out
excluding
the
cherry
stout
and
not
to
mention
this
beer
is
a
great
value
probably
the
cheapest
flanders
style
ale
that
is
out
there
enigma
drinks
like
a
cider
prickly
with
some
carbonation
but
not
thick
in
body
definitely
an
interesting
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
thin
head
low
retention
oily
clear
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
sour
cherries
peppermint
with
cinnamon
standing
out
interesting
taste
is
mouthpuckeringly
sour
with
a
pleasant
sour
cherry
taste
slightly
peppery
burn
and
warming
on
the
throat
tart
interesting
unique
style
points
not
picking
up
too
much
oak
or
vanilla
but
what
an
interesting
beer
none
the
less
d
a
little
less
cherry
would
give
this
very
high
drinkability
but
might
disturb
that
nice
balance
of
styles
that
this
beer
has
going
for
it
multiple
servings
would
be
welcomed
neither
the
acidity
nor
the
fruit
are
overwhelming
not
exactly
an
enigma
but
definitely
thought
provoking
d
this
is
a
very
good
rich
fruit
beer
the
balance
between
the
cherry
and
barrel
chracteristics
is
wonderful
much
better
than
wisconsin
belgian
red
and
more
tame
as
well
i
would
like
this
to
be
a
bit
wilder
but
its
very
good
as
is
another
great
job
by
ng
md
mouthfeel
is
light
and
enjoyable
with
a
pleasant
tick
on
the
tongue
at
the
end
very
drinkable
but
certainly
a
siper
that
should
be
concentrated
on
when
drinking
d
a
bit
unique
yummy
and
refreshing
leave
it
to
new
glarus
for
another
wonderfully
executed
yet
nothrills
beer
d
subtlety
is
the
trend
in
this
meticulouslycrafted
beer
highlynuanced
this
is
one
to
ponder
drinkabilitythis
is
a
delicious
fruit
beer
that
gives
you
a
lot
of
cherry
flavor
while
you
drink
this
beer
complex
flavors
arise
on
every
sip
d
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
beer
light
enough
and
refreshing
enough
for
a
summer
day
the
subtle
tartness
propels
this
one
forward
very
smooth
without
any
overpowering
flavors
could
easily
put
down
a
few
of
these
sitting
on
the
back
deck
my
compliments
to
the
brewery
cheers
d
i
liked
it
but
i
prefer
olde
english
porter
to
this
one
that
beer
has
more
going
on
and
the
flavors
contrast
more
giving
it
more
depth
this
beer
smells
awesome
but
tastewise
it
falls
a
bit
short
this
like
the
olde
english
is
a
flanders
more
fruit
beer
less
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
not
much
special
going
on
here
might
be
a
good
conversion
sour
for
beer
lovers
looking
to
get
into
sours
not
a
heavy
sour
taste
not
worth
hunting
but
good
to
try
if
youre
in
the
distribution
area
d
very
drinkable
beer
the
sourness
gives
it
easy
drinkability
and
as
most
sours
become
tiresome
on
the
taste
buds
this
beer
begins
to
shine
drinkability
is
good
other
than
the
whiskey
aftertaste
detracting
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
tart
and
has
a
sticky
aftertaste
overall
pretty
decent
d
a
really
unique
beer
tart
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
really
resembles
a
jelly
covered
biscuit
to
me
i
look
forward
to
drinkin
a
few
more
of
these
review
from
some
short
scrawled
notes
dark
amber
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
aroma
is
of
brown
sugar
cherries
light
funk
spice
and
leather
flavor
has
a
crazy
cinnamon
thing
going
on
which
i
thought
was
interesting
some
cherry
and
light
vanilla
nice
tartness
but
not
overly
sour
spicy
and
delicious
am
i
crazy
with
this
idea
of
cinnamon
being
present
body
is
full
side
of
medium
low
carbonation
light
alcohol
heat
on
the
finish
so
im
not
sure
of
the
abv
on
this
one
but
thought
it
was
delicious
poured
into
a
normal
water
glass
was
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
fairly
light
2
finger
head
aroma
was
of
dark
fruits
and
malt
with
some
sourness
added
initial
taste
was
of
sourness
although
less
than
i
expected
followed
by
chocolate
and
cherries
slightly
sweet
slightly
sour
a
good
combination
da
very
easy
drinking
good
introductory
beer
for
people
interested
in
sour
beers
d
enigma
a
mystery
or
something
that
cant
be
figured
out
an
aptly
named
beer
in
this
case
theres
so
much
going
on
in
this
brew
yet
not
one
dominates
the
flavor
experience
is
different
every
time
great
complexity
and
a
mouthfeel
that
really
separates
out
all
the
flavors
magnificent
brew
all
around
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
slightly
syrupy
with
a
good
nip
of
carbonation
refreshing
these
ng
beers
would
be
off
the
charts
if
more
funky
and
sour
but
then
theyd
lose
some
of
their
easy
drinking
and
accessible
to
most
palates
charm
drinkability
goes
down
easy
the
fruity
and
sweet
aftertaste
along
with
a
light
puckering
sourness
helps
to
prepare
me
for
the
next
sip
d
the
nice
interesting
aspects
of
this
taste
fade
as
you
drink
and
then
it
just
becomes
sweet
and
tart
not
so
great
this
is
an
above
average
brew
to
begin
but
kind
of
descends
as
you
go
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
one
that
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
quite
the
enigma
indeed
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
and
will
likely
drink
it
again
if
i
get
the
chance
overall
a
light
boring
fruit
beer
i
really
feel
like
this
is
a
sour
and
should
be
categorized
as
an
american
wild
ale
but
whatever
very
good
beer
anyone
who
likes
fruits
beers
or
sours
should
get
hold
of
this
wonderful
gateway
into
the
world
of
sourheads
should
any
wish
to
utilize
it
in
such
a
manner
overall
a
very
interesting
and
approachable
brew
im
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
thanks
again
scot
d
goes
down
the
hatch
way
too
quickly
i
could
put
away
of
few
of
these
at
a
time
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
that
i
am
glad
ng
brought
back
given
i
missed
it
the
first
time
around
great
job
again
new
glarus
ill
be
heading
over
the
boarder
to
wi
soon
to
grab
another
pack
of
this
pours
a
garnet
color
with
very
little
head
but
has
tan
fresh
ring
til
the
end
i
smell
cherries
and
sour
yeast
some
rich
malt
vanilla
and
musty
oak
the
taste
is
sour
cherries
first
with
wild
funky
yeast
it
mixes
with
vanilla
and
almond
then
some
earthy
peat
taste
just
a
twinge
of
sour
vinegar
round
this
sour
brown
out
it
was
excellent
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
with
tart
cherries
and
vanilla
and
malt
with
a
little
wood
and
smoke
this
is
not
as
sour
as
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
but
it
sure
did
have
plenty
of
flavors
going
on
just
another
outstanding
brew
from
ng
very
highly
recommended
i
got
this
in
a
trade
with
jojomonda
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
an
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
clear
mauve
with
a
very
fizzy
white
2
finger
head
the
head
leaves
instantly
and
leaves
no
lacing
tart
cherries
and
acetic
acid
are
both
very
strong
sweet
and
sour
cherries
are
the
first
taste
followed
by
lots
of
vinegary
tartness
it
is
very
drying
this
brew
is
very
light
and
highly
carbonated
imo
more
of
a
flanders
style
ale
than
a
fruit
ale
in
any
event
very
enjoyable
i
headed
into
this
with
some
trepidation
after
my
experience
with
the
old
english
porter
which
i
found
to
be
foul
this
was
a
completely
different
beast
with
a
variety
of
complex
flavors
that
merged
nicely
this
beer
is
a
freakin
enigma
dont
know
what
to
think
of
it
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
before
it
disappears
no
doubt
a
very
impressive
outing
one
that
has
expanded
my
appreciation
for
this
style
drinks
well
enough
for
me
to
put
down
a
few
of
these
i
dont
quite
see
a
big
difference
between
this
and
their
cherry
stout
however
this
is
a
bit
more
sour
and
a
bit
less
malty
but
not
much
of
a
difference
in
my
opinion
still
a
good
beer
this
is
just
further
proof
that
new
glarus
knows
their
fruits
drink
this
is
a
sour
i
could
drink
many
of
in
a
sitting
perfect
for
a
hot
day
like
yesterday
and
today
this
really
reminds
me
of
monks
cafe
which
i
find
a
terrible
representation
of
the
style
this
one
like
that
one
is
just
too
sweet
and
the
oak
just
doesnt
meld
properly
pours
a
nice
mediumbrown
color
with
just
a
tinge
of
red
a
good
frothy
ecru
head
rapidly
dissipates
and
retreats
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
good
cherry
aroma
is
immediately
noticeable
along
with
some
spice
and
a
little
wood
this
one
is
just
a
little
bit
sour
with
tart
pie
cherries
and
vanilla
i
have
enjoyed
all
of
the
unplugged
beers
i
have
tried
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
was
so
hoping
for
much
more
tartness
and
sour
beer
character
like
lost
abbeys
red
poppy
but
this
beer
leans
too
much
towards
the
fruit
beer
which
ng
tends
to
do
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
when
i
say
that
i
hope
dan
is
just
gearing
up
the
palate
of
wisconsin
beer
drinkers
for
a
real
sour
beer
either
that
or
bring
back
the
sour
brown
ale
that
was
a
very
well
crafted
oude
bruin
better
drinkability
than
the
other
fruit
beers
from
new
glarus
that
ive
had
i
still
think
i
would
only
have
one
in
an
evening
though
drinkability
is
very
high
probably
the
most
drinkable
new
glarus
fruit
beer
ive
had
yet
i
know
this
is
labeled
as
a
sour
brown
but
it
really
doesnt
have
the
characteristics
of
that
style
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
i
can
see
why
it
is
a
cult
classic
2007
audible
fizz
nice
head
on
a
yearaged
bottle
spice
woody
barn
funk
and
celery
oddly
enough
still
at
the
same
level
of
tartness
medium
carbonation
still
funky
and
complex
as
well
maybe
not
as
distinct
as
it
was
fresh
looking
forward
to
finishing
off
the
stash
pretty
good
one
by
new
glarus
not
the
greatest
but
a
solid
offering
drinkability
is
good
very
good
beer
overall
d
this
beer
is
sweet
but
not
overly
so
and
not
as
sour
as
anticipated
a
lot
of
the
same
characteristics
of
the
cranbic
i
was
telling
another
ba
dan
might
be
training
our
palates
for
when
he
pulls
out
the
big
guns
3
53

overall
a
damn
good
beer
and
one
that
i
wish
was
a
year
round
offering
but
ill
take
it
when
i
can
get
it
and
im
getting
a
lot
of
it
this
year
the
only
thing
that
i
can
say
would
benefit
from
improvement
is
the
thinnish
appearance
and
thats
something
that
i
personally
dont
care
too
much
about
anyway
keep
on
making
hits
dan
and
randy
this
ones
damn
dandy
cheers
overall
this
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
until
they
stop
making
it
im
a
huge
sour
fan
and
this
has
just
enough
sour
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
no
sipping
this
beer
for
me
big
gulps
and
its
gone
overall
very
good
beer
im
new
to
sours
and
this
is
a
great
experience
this
beer
is
nice
and
lively
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
very
easy
drinking
and
overall
delicious
to
me
it
was
reminiscent
of
monks
café
flemish
sour
red
ale
albeit
with
more
fruity
character
i
only
bought
a
4
pack
and
i
am
regretting
the
decision
already
i
am
tempted
to
open
another
but
i
must
resist
from
the
other
reviews
i
read
it
seems
as
though
it
only
gets
better
with
age
tartness
and
sourness
are
muzzled
here
the
cherry
presence
reminds
me
more
of
cherry
pie
filling
than
of
fresh
cherry
there
is
a
cleanness
in
both
the
mouthfeel
and
finish
of
this
beer
that
leaves
me
wanting
more
while
quite
enjoyable
i
expected
a
slightly
more
bruising
sour
experience
oh
what
could
have
been
with
this
beer
a
local
sour
would
be
a
real
treat
having
said
that
this
beer
drinks
so
smoothly
and
easily
that
coupled
with
the
lack
of
crushing
experience
make
this
a
breeze
to
drink
poured
an
amber
brownred
color
with
close
to
no
head
just
a
ring
around
my
glass
the
nose
was
pungent
with
a
salty
sweet
aroma
initially
likened
to
potato
chips
when
examined
closer
i
found
it
to
be
more
smoky
cherry
and
vanilla
the
taste
was
very
smooth
vanilla
creamy
with
soft
cherry
notes
just
the
right
amount
of
bourbon
appears
here
too
if
i
had
to
lay
criticism
i
would
say
it
was
a
bit
too
saltyflavored
this
beer
really
reminded
me
of
soft
cooked
mushy
cherries
delicious
and
i
will
seek
this
one
out
again
o
very
much
a
classic
oud
bruin
new
glarus
enigma
captures
what
so
many
of
the
classics
to
time
and
again
tart
earthy
nose
with
sweeter
bready
malts
that
linger
on
the
finish
providing
nice
balance
for
an
easy
drinking
training
wheel
sour
d
really
enjoyable

a
thin
offwhite
collar
the
aroma
is
complex
and
inviting
smelling
intensely
of
funk
and
sherrylike
oxidation
with
a
backbone
of
cherries
and
bourbon
theres
a
bit
of
toffee
and
faint
buttery
oak
as
it
warms
tart
cherries
are
surprisingly
upfront
on
the
palate
for
such
an
old
beer
caramel
bourbon
and
sherry
are
equally
prominent
leading
into
a
lightly
acetic
midpalate
with
more
sweet
and
tart
cherry
flavor
and
a
touch
of
balsamic
vinegar
finishes
sweet
and
tart
with
lingering
cherry
and
bourbon
flavors
delicious
this
is
just
excellent
overall
i
hope
new
glarus
brews
this
again
and
from
what
i
hear
it
looks
like
they
might
mouth
tastes
like
cherry
sauerkraut
sweet
sour
cider
vinegar
mulling
spices
puckeringly
sour
complex
enjoyable
quite
lovely
very
sour
fantastic
would
love
to
see
this
one
come
back
big
thank
you
for
new
glarus
d
good
i
really
liked
this
beer
d
its
not
quite
clear
what
this
enigma
is
was
or
was
supposed
to
be
maybe
something
akin
to
a
flanders
red
oud
bruin
it
sure
as
hell
is
a
curious
thing
best
way
i
can
describe
is
like
a
suicide
you
know
after
little
league
the
cokespritedr
pepperorange
crush
combo
i
was
never
really
a
big
fan
of
that
concoction
not
loving
this
either
glad
to
have
tried
but
thinking
im
ok
with
this
one
being
retired
and
thats
from
someone
who
likes
the
funky
belgian
styles
12
ounce
acquired
in
a
trade
with
iowaherkeye
thanks
again
man
for
a
chance
to
try
this
one
drank
tonight
from
a
pint
glass
color
is
a
dark
red
with
brownish
tone
one
inch
frothy
light
tan
head
that
lasts
a
little
while
some
lacing
at
first
aroma
consists
of
sweet
malts
raspberries
cherries
yeast
vanilla
oak
and
earthiness
flavor
starts
off
with
red
apples
and
cherries
sweetness
in
the
middle
with
a
big
berry
flavor
earthy
and
sweet
in
the
finish
lots
of
berry
flavors
with
a
little
tart
all
the
way
through
but
more
sweet
than
sour
definitely
wild
yeast
in
there
like
how
it
warms
up
with
lots
of
oaky
barrel
characteristics
sweet
fruity
and
softly
sour
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
moderate
level
of
carbonation
taste
lingers
for
a
few
minutes
could
drink
more
of
this
quite
easily
do
not
know
have
any
idea
of
the
alcohol
content
but
it
seemed
light
and
this
drank
smoothly
not
heavy
or
overly
sweet
one
of
the
more
interesting
unplugged
brews
have
not
had
a
bad
new
glarus
fruit
beer
yet
it
seems
like
it
is
what
they
do
best
hopefully
this
one
is
rebrewed
this
seems
to
have
aged
very
well
hope
to
drink
it
again
recommended
if
you
like
belgian
red
and
brett
this
may
just
be
the
perfect
beer
for
you
id
be
more
interested
in
checking
out
a
fresh
batch
that
still
has
the
sour
and
woody
flavors
going
on
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
very
nice
get
one
while
you
still
can
d
the
weird
flavors
of
cherry
and
tobacco
with
some
sour
and
vinegar
make
this
a
difficult
beer
to
enjoy
much
of
definitely
a
onebottle
max
on
this
one
and
im
glad
im
sharing
with
my
wife
lighttreason
that
being
said
its
still
a
damnfine
tasting
beer
just
not
one
i
could
enjoy
a
lot
of
new
glarus
please
make
more
like
this
d
the
complexity
of
the
ale
is
stunning
age
seems
to
have
assisted
the
flavors
in
blending
together
the
ale
blurs
the
lines
coming
close
to
crossing
into
oud
bruin
territory
drinking
this
right
after
the
phoenix
kriek
might
have
been
a
bad
idea
but
this
is
still
an
excellent
beer
the
nose
is
more
muted
maybe
a
touch
sulfurlike
no
spice
character
is
present
the
cherry
character
is
mild
but
deep
the
palate
is
a
blend
of
fresh
tart
cherries
a
little
oak
brown
sugar
and
vanilla
no
oxidation
is
present
theres
a
touch
of
vinegar
as
well
this
is
more
beerlike
than
the
phoenix
kriek
excellent
stuff

another
wonderful
creation
from
new
glarus
who
really
knows
how
to
mix
fruit
and
beer
its
big
and
complex
but
also
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
pours
a
clouded
red
tinted
brown
nose
is
a
vanilla
wood
thing
flavor
is
crrrazy
good
amazing
combination
of
vanilla
very
dark
cherries
wood
and
cream
cherries
and
cream
theres
also
a
touch
of
what
seems
like
cinammon
really
nice
collaboration
of
flavors
feel
is
smooth
on
liquid
and
low
on
carbonation
this
is
one
tasty
fruit
beer
a
bit
high
in
the
lactic
content
but
its
pretty
nice
d
the
alcohol
seems
nonexistant
and
coupled
with
the
delicious
components
of
the
taste
this
makes
for
an
incredibly
easy
and
refreshing
beer
very
drinkable
beer
with
some
great
unique
qualities
its
a
shame
you
wont
ever
be
seeing
this
one
again
d
wish
i
could
have
more
its
a
shame
that
its
not
produced
anymore
mouthfeel
has
an
exceptional
smoothness
to
it
steady
mellow
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
almost
has
a
silkiness
to
it
that
makes
it
incredibly
enjoyable
to
sip
overall
just
a
solid
intense
and
flavorful
brew
whether
you
like
sour
beers
or
not
you
should
be
able
to
enjoy
this
glad
i
have
another
bottle
sitting
around
darn
good
stuff
notes
mad
thanks
to
theblackmallard
for
giving
me
a
bottle
of
this
it
lived
up
to
its
expectations
and
thensome
isnt
this
inexpensive
you
wisconsin
folks
are
lucky
dogs
great
beer
amazing
what
dan
does
with
fruit
poured
into
a
pint
glass
formed
a
minimal
18
beige
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
reddish
amber
brew
head
is
quickly
down
to
swirls
and
rim
coverage
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
tart
with
some
sweet
funk
taste
makes
me
think
cherries
and
apples
wonder
if
this
a
mixture
of
one
of
their
berry
brews
and
their
vaunted
apple
ale
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
especially
for
a
sour
beer
and
drinkability
is
quite
nice
with
the
tartness
cutting
the
sweet
easily
ill
add
my
lament
to
the
previous
that
this
brew
is
no
longer
thanks
thomashardy
for
the
opportunity
to
revisit
taste
tart
fruity
apple
cider
cherries
grapes
leather
and
a
bit
of
oak
full
body
medium
carbonation
i
would
drink
this
all
day
if
i
could
this
beer
is
much
better
warm
than
cold
however
it
wasnt
my
favorite
drinkability
i
think
id
enjoy
this
again
if
it
were
available
a
fine
brew
in
a
style
i
dont
often
lean
towards
very
interesting
brew
and
far
from
unpleasant
i
would
definitely
snatch
it
up
again
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
d
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
sour
beers
that
ive
tried
it
might
be
a
good
starting
point
to
the
world
of
more
sour
brews
thanks
to
mmmmbeeeer
for
sharing
a
bottle
this
beer
is
a
lightly
hazed
reddish
brownamber
with
a
thin
and
filmy
offwhite
head
that
diminishes
to
nothing
fairly
soon
minimal
lacing
ciderlike
aroma
with
touches
of
yeast
and
spice
mediumbodied
with
a
tart
fruity
character
and
malt
nut
and
spice
flavors
the
finish
is
sour
cherries
with
a
lingering
tart
fruit
aftertaste
overall
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
that
i
would
try
again
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
enigma
isnt
an
enigma
at
all
its
what
results
when
a
talented
brewer
at
the
top
of
his
game
is
unleashed
unplugged
and
lets
his
imagination
run
wild
if
brewed
on
a
regular
basis
this
would
be
one
of
the
best
flanders
oud
bruins
in
america
maybe
the
best
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
and
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
sample
one
not
that
typical
not
something
that
i
ordinarily
would
drink
but
it
was
a
good
change
of
pace
nice
work
once
again
from
dan
carey
d
i
could
have
a
bottle
or
maybe
two
of
this
but
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
palate
overall
i
was
very
impressed
i
dont
remember
seeing
this
one
on
the
shelves
the
last
time
i
there
so
i
think
they
have
been
keeping
some
in
the
basement
aging
i
didnt
try
this
when
it
came
out
but
it
currently
is
great
grab
one
if
you
see
it
d
truly
an
enigma
just
deciding
what
it
isand
failing
its
sour
and
big
and
fun
riddle
solved
overall
this
was
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
tasted
very
unique
and
really
was
quite
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
i
really
liked
this
and
would
love
to
have
some
more
seems
everything
coming
out
of
here
is
a
winner
and
this
was
no
exception
go
and
try
it
if
you
can
d
lots
of
complex
flavors
and
smells
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
id
try
it
again
if
i
could
i
realize
that
this
is
listed
on
ba
as
a
fruitvegetable
beer
but
this
is
one
of
tne
of
the
best
oud
brunesour
flemish
brown
ales
in
the
world
absolutely
worth
seeking
out
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
wouldnt
rush
out
to
get
another
i
know
its
only
brewed
once
too
but
its
a
well
done
beer
ive
sat
on
this
for
a
while
hoping
for
something
anything
as
i
did
with
cherry
stout
and
once
again
i
received
nothing
in
return
what
was
once
fresh
when
sour
brown
arrived
is
now
tired
im
hoping
the
rauch
the
next
unplugged
has
nothing
to
do
with
brett
or
oak
barrels
the
body
is
awesome
thick
and
syrupy
clinging
to
your
mouth
and
lingering
on
long
after
youve
swallowed
there
is
some
noticeable
carbonation
running
through
your
mouth
and
a
wonderful
alcohol
warming
feel
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
stuff
before
it
disappears
drinkability
too
bad
this
was
a
one
shot
beer
very
tasty
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
drink
i
would
like
to
have
several
of
one
note
this
beer
is
one
of
the
few
that
i
believe
was
better
while
it
was
colder
it
seemed
to
lose
a
bit
of
its
complexity
as
it
warmed
still
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
murky
ruby
red
with
a
nice
brown
tint
head
is
a
good
two
fingers
that
quickly
dies
down
to
just
about
nothing
stickiness
is
nonexistant
smell
has
a
big
cherry
character
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
almost
seems
like
its
their
belgian
red
mixed
with
their
uffda
some
sour
smell
in
the
nose
too
very
unique
smelling
to
say
the
least
taste
starts
off
with
a
great
cherry
sweetness
followed
by
a
sour
cherry
aftertaste
a
bit
of
bready
flavors
appear
but
are
dominated
by
the
cherry
not
a
whole
lot
other
than
cherries
going
on
in
terms
of
flavor
but
i
love
it
this
basically
tastes
like
my
grandmas
cherry
pie
tongue
tingles
from
start
to
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
i
really
like
this
brew
not
as
sour
as
the
belgian
red
but
at
the
same
time
not
as
sweet
maybe
someday
theyll
brew
this
one
again
its
appearance
is
a
deep
choclate
brown
with
an
ever
so
tinge
of
pink
to
it
the
head
is
light
tan
and
has
that
slight
pinkness
to
it
as
well
strong
aromas
of
tobacco
oak
chocolate
malt
sour
cherries
and
some
sweet
molasses
dominate
the
nose
such
a
complex
bouquet
of
aromas
that
it
is
really
something
that
is
hard
to
pin
down
the
taste
is
strong
sour
cherries
and
back
grounds
of
chocolate
malt
the
oak
definitely
comes
out
and
adds
a
sense
of
sweetness
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
smooth
almost
cloying
very
easy
going
down
if
i
wasnt
so
partial
to
the
belgian
red
i
would
say
that
this
is
the
best
thing
out
of
new
glarus
ever
to
me
this
is
a
good
after
dinner
drink
or
desert
type
beer
even
for
breakfast
perhaps
not
the
type
i
look
forward
to
indulging
in
again
surprisingly
it
also
matches
quite
well
with
a
mild
baby
swiss
pretty
drinkable
i
doubt
ill
have
another
tonite
but
it
wont
be
long
before
i
get
an
urge
to
taste
this
interesting
brew
again
really
well
done
i
love
the
new
glarus
brewery
but
enigma
was
not
to
my
liking
i
still
suggest
you
go
to
the
impeccably
clean
brewery
and
take
the
tour
drinkability
where
can
i
get
more
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
dating
system
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
cloudy
reddish
brown
it
had
almost
no
head
and
what
was
there
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
sour
cherries
with
an
oaky
vanilla
backbone
this
age
has
aged
a
bit
so
the
aroma
was
toned
down
the
taste
also
seemed
mellowed
out
by
time
it
was
good
but
missing
the
sour
cherry
bite
that
i
love
in
these
beers
overall
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
wish
i
couldve
tied
it
when
it
was
new

a

would
definitely
drink
another
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
out
d
so
different
it
has
to
be
tried
if
you
can
still
get
your
hands
on
it
still
its
a
sipper
and
not
exactly
mouth
watering
d
the
beer
has
a
balance
which
makes
it
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
like
most
of
new
glaruss
beers
but
thier
fruit
beers
while
great
always
toe
the
line
to
being
too
fruity
for
me
i
like
that
enigma
has
the
raspberry
notes
but
then
is
layered
with
the
brett
yeast
and
the
alcohol
and
the
bourbon
notes
i
think
this
beer
is
a
very
interesting
experiment
and
is
a
nice
break
from
the
ordinary
another
highly
recommended
brew
from
new
glarus
this
beer
is
not
exceptional
but
ok
hazy
and
muddyriver
brown
almost
no
head
very
sour
lambic
and
cherry
odor
some
hints
of
vanilla
when
cold
very
sour
cherry
like
belgian
red
but
with
more
malt
backbone
and
a
little
less
sweet
as
it
warms
sourness
becomes
more
lambiclike
and
horsey
nicely
tart
and
malty
medium
to
full
bodied
a
very
wellmade
beer
as
should
come
as
no
surprize
i
think
they
should
have
this
one
and
their
sour
brown
as
regulars
in
their
lineup
a
very
nice
surprise
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
but
came
away
impressed
i
think
its
more
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
than
a
fruitvege
beer
though
recommended
a
fine
beer
an
honor
to
drink
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
belgian
red
on
tap
im
pretty
sure
this
is
my
first
from
new
glaruss
unplugged
series
and
its
definately
a
winner
unique
in
every
aspect
and
a
great
sipper
drinkability
rates
high
on
the
fun
to
drink
scale
it
is
sweet
but
id
say
very
blanced
like
a
lot
of
other
lighter
sour
beers
theres
nothing
in
this
beer
to
stop
you
from
drinking
ten
of
them
other
than
the
availability
drinkability
is
awesome
a
wonderfully
zingy
fruity
earthy
little
brew
the
enigma
is
new
glarus
has
taken
the
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
and
turned
that
style
into
another
snappy
fun
drink
to
behold
yum
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
offering
from
one
of
my
most
sought
after
breweries
id
love
to
try
this
next
to
some
of
the
jolly
pumpkin
and
rodenbach
beers
hopefully
new
glarus
will
make
this
again
and
more
importantly
start
distributing
to
mi
since
either
of
these
will
unlikely
happen
anytime
soon
la
roja
from
jp
will
hold
me
over
i
cant
see
this
getting
much
better
over
time
just
maybe
more
tart
the
ugliest
beer
ive
ever
drank
but
as
far
as
sour
beers
go
this
has
to
be
my
personal
favourite
everything
is
kept
in
check
sweetness
sourness
acidity
but
still
remains
complex
thanks
demcorhip
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
i
like
this
beer
because
it
doesnt
hit
you
over
the
head
with
fruit
as
much
as
the
brewerys
belgian
red
or
raspberry
tart
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
and
tart
which
makes
you
want
more
wow
this
is
a
great
beer
and
the
best
of
brewer
dan
careys
unplugged
series
yet
tart
and
tangy
this
is
one
wild
brew
with
funky
aftertaste
overall
truly
is
quite
an
enigma
to
drink
i
liked
sipping
it
and
contemplating
what
i
tasted
as
a
good
comparison
i
came
up
with
the
sugar
covered
tartsour
gummy
candies
i
liked
it
a
lot
new
glarus
does
good
things
with
these
funky
yeast
strains
thanks
for
sharing
this
viggo
pours
a
very
hazy
reddish
brown
thick
off
white
head
some
lace
spots
decent
retention
neat
colour
smell
is
sweetsour
very
malty
some
chocolate
notes
toffee
some
fruits
but
dont
really
get
the
cherry
nice
sour
aroma
though
taste
is
caramel
sour
and
vinegar
through
the
middle
sweet
fruits
and
brown
sugar
in
the
finish
bit
more
sourness
bit
light
on
flavour
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
smooth
but
not
enough
flavour
enjoyable
though
and
definately
a
treat
thanks
scott
this
is
quite
a
distinctive
brew
i
wonder
if
it
is
the
cherries
that
add
that
sort
of
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
flavor
this
beer
is
really
nice
i
really
like
the
interplay
of
fruit
malt
and
fermentation
character
really
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
is
that
this
beer
tastes
like
a
beery
version
of
an
oaky
oatmeal
raisin
cookie
i
love
oatmeal
raisin
cookies
and
i
am
certainly
digging
this
beer
if
i
lived
in
wisconsin
i
would
beg
for
this
to
be
a
year
round
beer
as
this
would
be
a
perfect
staple
in
the
beer
fridge
second
trial
i
like
sour
i
like
sour
a
lot
so
its
not
surprising
that
i
enjoy
this
beer
that
being
said
i
dont
think
its
best
sour
ive
had
but
it
is
very
good
it
pours
a
very
cloudy
dense
brownishred
the
aroma
is
sour
cherries
apples
and
a
little
alcohol
the
taste
is
quite
similar
and
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
although
my
second
tasting
which
came
quite
a
while
after
the
first
seemed
slightly
less
sour
and
slightly
more
alcoholy
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
im
glad
that
the
unplugged
line
seems
to
take
real
chances
good
bad
it
doesnt
really
matter
as
long
as
its
something
different
although
this
one
does
happen
to
be
delicious
that
sweet
luscious
tang
of
pomegranate
and
sour
coconut
juice
rise
from
the
glass
lubricious
and
sassy
with
faint
pine
fusels
nips
of
higher
alcohols
rising
warmth
and
glowing
brett
great
stuff
lighter
on
the
apple
skins
and
edging
more
towards
acetone
yet
with
a
pleasing
grape
must
edge
pours
a
murky
ruddy
amber
hazed
and
rimmed
with
offwhite
on
the
tongue
a
potent
kick
of
sweet
acidity
rich
warm
and
mouth
filling
with
a
christmas
potpourri
of
tangled
florals
and
perfumes
lots
of
fermenting
pale
fruits
over
a
luscious
creamy
malt
base
the
sour
notes
and
wild
funk
are
beautifully
blended
into
the
malt
character
here
first
with
the
bold
flow
of
oaked
farm
fields
and
cheese
must
then
into
a
creamy
grain
of
roasted
caramel
and
toasted
almonds
sweet
and
silky
then
out
the
back
door
with
fading
hop
presence
maybe
more
than
the
style
typically
brings
on
the
palate
so
airy
and
mystifying
with
gentle
breezes
of
sweetness
and
acidity
not
scorching
yet
gentle
and
calm
with
a
deft
use
of
wildness
to
make
a
very
peaceful
and
enjoyable
version
big
thanks
sammy
d
quite
a
pleasure
to
drink
utterly
smooth
and
surprisingly
well
balanced
between
the
tart
and
the
sweetness
highly
recommended
as
it
will
change
your
stance
on
fruit
style
beers
truly
an
enigma
and
very
complex
poured
a
reddish
gold
into
a
sample
glass
significant
pinkish
head
that
fades
fast
strong
cherry
and
caramel
malt
aroma
slick
oily
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
cherry
with
hints
of
coffee
beans
and
molasses
and
an
acidic
applejuice
aftertaste
thanks
for
the
sample
sammy
thanks
jpm30
for
this
unexpected
bonus
you
are
generous
to
a
fault
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
balanced
fairly
well
against
the
fruity
and
sourtart
flavours
especially
as
it
warmed
and
had
time
to
breathe
nice
and
enjoyable
thanks
to
jd
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
complexity
but
it
is
very
well
blended
there
is
a
cherry
coconut
flavor
that
has
an
interesting
fruit
punch
flavor
but
also
a
hint
of
wild
ale
to
it
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
with
lots
of
good
character
into
a
tulip
glass
poured
a
good
brown
color
cloudy
a
decent
starting
head
that
shrinks
to
a
swirly
film
a
little
lacing
pretty
nice
lookin
aroma
is
prominently
sour
toned
oaky
hints
from
conditioning
vanilla
some
fruits
in
there
hard
to
distinguish
but
i
want
to
say
rasberries
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
sour
sweet
fruits
tart
rasberry
the
oaks
line
the
edges
of
this
delicious
brew
the
mouth
is
crisp
and
dry
sour
well
bodied
and
overall
its
just
a
finely
crafted
piece
of
work
makes
me
with
i
got
the
4pack
kinda
like
an
oud
bruin
and
kriek
blend
however
the
emphasis
is
on
the
sweet
allowing
a
tart
counterpart
for
balance
the
beer
shows
a
pleasent
malt
sweetness
brown
ale
but
with
a
tart
candylike
sourness
a
cherry
aroma
helps
to
solidify
the
tartness
while
adding
an
added
fruit
sweetness
an
earthy
agedhop
character
adds
balance
to
the
sweetness
and
contribues
an
earthy
dirty
complexity
with
all
this
going
on
the
flavors
are
well
melded
and
properly
aged
a
solid
malt
sweetness
wants
to
play
heavy
to
the
mouth
but
with
the
tarness
acting
as
a
thinning
agent
to
make
the
beer
very
drinkable
while
adding
a
mild
dryness
and
astringency
late
a
cherry
flavor
persists
even
after
the
remaining
flavors
subside
unusual
flavors
but
likable
nevertheless
pours
an
off
whie
head
cloudy
with
a
red
caramel
body
smell
is
funky
carbonation
is
medium
to
high
very
sour
ale
the
cherries
are
present
but
not
the
main
act
like
the
belgian
red
the
brown
ale
aspect
is
more
evident
in
the
after
taste
i
actually
enjoyed
this
more
than
belgian
red
which
im
sure
is
sacrilege
of
some
sort
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
unique
offering
pulled
this
bottle
out
of
the
fridge
and
poured
it
into
my
favorite
glass
color
was
brownish
orange
and
cloudy
head
was
tan
and
dissipated
almost
immediately
very
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
head
retention
smell
was
somewhat
sweetmalty
first
taste
was
a
surprise
my
first
reaction
was
that
it
tasted
a
little
like
a
wine
cooler
but
ive
always
thought
that
about
the
fruity
beers
its
actually
pretty
good
bot
nothing
ill
drink
very
regularly
i
dont
think
id
even
want
to
drink
two
in
a
row
so
the
drinkability
would
be
considered
low
for
me
bottle
courtesy
of
monger
poured
a
dirty
brownreddish
color
ale
with
a
medium
light
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
consists
of
oak
with
some
tart
notes
and
some
red
wine
characteristics
taste
is
a
very
well
balance
mix
of
oak
with
some
tartness
and
some
acidic
notes
well
balance
by
light
cherries
and
some
dry
red
wine
body
is
above
average
with
some
low
filtration
and
medium
carbonation
very
well
done
and
definitely
something
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
drinkability
is
through
the
fricking
roof
i
know
where
there
is
more
and
i
am
going
to
clean
them
out
i
will
not
say
where
pours
out
a
goodsized
head
with
an
almost
buttery
smell
in
the
backround
its
almost
lambiclike
with
just
a
faint
hint
of
horse
blanket
the
taste
isnt
quite
as
sour
as
the
lambic
and
its
more
bitter
the
flavor
isnt
as
smooth
with
bitter
flavors
it
has
it
still
has
a
malty
buttery
flavor
in
its
backround
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
giving
it
a
bite
overall
i
started
out
loving
it
but
i
dont
think
id
reach
into
my
cellar
for
a
while
for
this
one
good
stuff
after
reading
the
label
i
figured
i
would
review
this
with
kreik
guidlines
in
mind
and
although
there
are
similarities
the
name
of
this
beer
definately
fits
im
off
to
email
the
brewery
to
reconsider
this
for
another
run
drinkability
good
lord
i
just
wish
i
had
stocked
up
on
more
of
these
when
i
was
in
wisconsin
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
complex
yet
mellow
big
and
creative
yet
affordable
sour
but
not
too
sour
way
up
there
on
my
list
for
sure
and
definitely
the
best
ive
had
from
new
glarus
the
sales
clerk
at
rileys
said
it
all
this
beer
changes
every
time
you
drink
it
i
do
love
the
redbrown
murky
appearance
though
bottle
via
trevorwideman
consumed
with
rudge75
after
drinking
the
belgian
red
dark
red
in
colour
with
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
cherries
a
hint
of
vinegar
and
vanilla
in
the
mouth
a
great
balance
is
struck
between
the
cherry
oak
vanilla
nutty
almond
and
gentle
sourness
a
cleamer
finishing
than
expected
but
thats
not
neessarily
a
bad
thing
complex
and
flavorful
yet
very
easy
to
drink
good
stuff
and
it
made
an
interesting
counterpoint
to
the
sweeter
and
more
straightforward
belgian
red
edit
see
bighuges
review
below
i
think
he
picks
this
brew
apart
pretty
well
new
glarus
is
the
undisputed
king
of
fruit
beers
in
america
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
belgian
red
but
really
liked
the
sour
brown
so
i
guess
im
a
little
different
than
most
reviewers
on
pouring
it
has
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
minimal
head
doesnt
look
the
most
appealing
but
i
guess
its
about
like
what
i
expected
smells
woody
with
apples
some
sweet
apples
and
some
earthy
notes
taste
begins
sweeter
with
more
cherry
than
the
nose
would
let
on
some
vanilla
with
some
more
sweet
notes
almost
a
chocolate
flavor
but
not
quite
slightly
sour
but
the
sour
brown
never
truly
shows
itself
smoother
than
expected
but
i
almost
want
a
bit
more
acidity
in
the
finish
the
flavors
blend
but
dont
come
out
fully
still
its
nice
and
somewhat
crisp
theres
a
solid
flavor
overall
but
its
nothing
great
murky
looking
brown
appearance
thin
bubbly
beige
head
lacing
is
spotty
in
nature
and
low
in
quantity
aroma
has
a
little
dusty
cellarlike
feel
to
it
also
some
sweet
and
sour
aspects
to
the
nose
cherry
and
brown
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
barrel
character
oaky
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
some
of
that
sweet
and
sour
character
more
sweet
than
sour
though
vanilla
and
cherry
are
present
brown
sugar
like
sweetness
maybe
a
little
molasses
moderately
carbonated
and
medium
bodied
finish
is
a
little
dry
good
rendition
here
speaking
of
which
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
the
taste
murky
wortish
red
brown
fluid
fills
the
rodenbach
flute
redtinted
cream
khaki
head
recedes
to
a
clingy
film
light
vinegar
flint
and
horse
blanket
cut
through
rummy
cherries
and
whiff
of
smoky
sugar
palate
reveals
moderately
sweet
cherries
and
cherry
sorbetjuice
up
front
whaa
wheres
the
sour
vinegar
funk
oh
there
it
is
better
late
than
never
the
back
of
the
palate
brings
out
more
complexity
with
whiskeyish
malt
vanilla
oak
toffee
before
sourness
and
acidic
flavors
takeover
the
dry
finish
there
is
a
little
residual
vanilla
and
cherry
leftover
though
spritzy
adventurous
carbonation
medium
body
all
in
all
i
really
like
the
sweet
and
sour
interplay
especially
with
the
oaky
vanilla
mixed
in
very
well
done
overall
impression
enjoyable
but
not
for
me
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
in
beer
especially
if
it
masks
the
typical
qualities
of
beer
barley
hops
yeast
etc
you
cant
get
past
the
sour
cheeries
in
this
one
its
well
made
but
i
wouldnt
want
another
probably
would
pair
well
with
dark
chocolate
worth
a
shot
14
12oz
bottles
shipped
down
from
dirtylou
thank
god
new
glarus
is
in
wisconsin
drinkability
heck
no
no
desire
to
have
this
beer
again
many
many
thanks
to
nflmvp
for
this
golden
opportunity
an
uncensored
uncut
and
unplugged
thanks
for
yet
another
new
glarus
winner
shipped
west
by
my
mate
bighuge
recommended
not
my
cup
of
tea
because
it
kinda
tastes
like
flavored
tea
spices
might
make
it
a
good
holiday
choice
this
is
another
great
fruit
beer
from
new
glarus
certainly
more
complex
and
better
suited
for
the
beer
geeks
than
the
belgian
red
and
raspberry
tart
feels
more
like
a
belgian
beer
than
those
well
done
i
was
honestly
a
little
let
down
by
this
one
i
was
under
the
impression
it
was
going
to
have
a
much
more
wild
taste
to
it
of
course
we
shouldnt
go
into
a
beer
expecting
much
of
anything
but
sometimes
its
unavoidable
it
was
enjoyable
for
a
one
time
thing
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
and
get
another
one
taste
is
just
plain
unusual
yet
wow
all
the
fruits
i
mentioned
before
make
an
appearance
but
the
straightup
farmhouse
funkiness
absolutely
smashes
the
palate
when
this
beer
hits
the
tongue
yes
sir
theres
a
little
belgian
trickery
in
here
theres
nothing
bitter
about
this
beer
at
all
just
lots
of
sweet
and
tart
flavour
to
make
you
salivate
for
more
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
carbonation
is
a
little
too
fizzy
and
rather
siezes
the
tongue
on
first
sip
other
than
that
this
is
a
real
sipper
that
is
really
very
unique
and
pleasant
im
very
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
it
smells
like
an
apple
orchard
on
a
warm
day
with
some
blackberry
pours
a
murky
rust
with
a
fast
diminishing
head
very
different
if
you
drink
it
without
making
an
effort
to
smell
it
at
the
same
time
the
tast
and
aroma
mix
to
complement
each
other
with
some
of
the
mustiness
of
fermenting
fruit
enhancing
the
sweetsour
taste
very
drinkable
in
that
it
gets
better
with
each
sip
this
is
a
very
aptly
named
beer
in
that
it
seems
to
mysteriously
change
from
a
forceful
cacophony
of
flavors
at
first
to
a
subtle
floral
easy
drinking
beer
at
the
last
yea
i
havent
used
the
word
cacophony
for
a
while
later
while
on
the
brewery
a
the
brewer
hinted
that
they
pasteurize
this
beer
by
pumping
it
into
the
boiled
kettle
and
heating
it
to
140f
i
get
the
feeling
they
do
this
or
something
to
stop
the
brett
action
on
all
their
fruit
beers
no
of
them
seem
very
hard
or
lambic
like
to
me
give
the
fermentation
process
they
described
on
the
tour
d
this
beer
would
scare
the
bejesus
out
of
non
seasoned
beer
drinkers
it
could
have
gone
either
way
but
too
much
cheese
and
it
could
be
a
serious
turn
off
personally
i
think
its
brilliant
another
feather
in
the
cap
for
new
glarus
one
of
the
finest
breweries
in
the
world
very
good
i
didnt
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
hoped
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
and
im
still
not
sure
i
fully
understand
this
beer
after
trying
it
i
suspect
this
might
be
why
its
labeled
a
fruitvegetable
beer
as
opposed
to
a
sour
brown
or
other
style
the
flavors
are
interesting
but
dont
add
up
to
a
winner
in
my
book
i
would
have
enjoyed
more
tartness
and
more
carbonation
on
the
palate
i
have
a
few
bottles
and
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
again
this
is
odd
very
sour
brown
wood
tasting
cherries
citrus
bitterness
very
weird
good
but
weird
brown
and
red
colored
hazy
hard
to
drink
very
aquired
taste
like
a
young
super
oaky
oxidized
bordeaux
good
but
too
strange
to
ever
buy
again
unless
i
acquire
a
taste
for
this
ive
had
duchesse
du
bourgogne
and
its
sort
of
like
this
what
a
rich
and
decadent
session
one
could
have
with
this
brew
the
depth
and
complexity
have
me
sipping
this
creation
in
blissfull
amazement
this
is
a
very
serious
beer
and
is
definately
created
for
the
serious
beer
drinker
and
isnt
something
that
would
go
over
well
with
a
typical
macro
drinker
a
great
beer
to
treat
onself
with
when
looking
for
quality
over
quantity
although
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
absolutely
addictive
the
only
the
thing
that
could
possibly
turn
you
off
is
the
price
worth
every
drop
every
penny
note
to
self
slowly
going
downhill
with
time
poured
a
murky
reddish
brown
color
with
a
good
off
white
colored
head
with
surprisingly
good
retention
smell
is
of
oak
vanilla
subdued
cherries
sour
apples
and
a
hint
of
bourbon
taste
starts
off
sour
but
slowly
and
seamlessly
transfers
into
an
oaky
vanilla
boubon
finish
there
is
tartness
throughout
the
taste
but
everything
is
blended
together
so
nicely
that
there
didnt
seem
to
be
an
overpowering
flavor
all
parts
were
seemingly
equal
medium
bodied
lower
carbonation
little
bit
of
a
dry
oaky
finish
drinkability
is
good
in
the
sense
that
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
but
i
felt
this
one
is
a
sipper
try
it
before
it
runs
out
again
i
didnt
think
too
much
of
this
following
my
initial
first
few
sips
but
enigma
definitely
grew
on
me
and
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
was
enjoying
it
quite
a
bit
not
something
id
probably
want
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
but
its
good
regardless
although
perhaps
brewed
as
a
onetime
offering
its
the
first
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
looks
like
it
was
retired
after
one
review
in
2005
and
now
it
has
been
offered
again
or
maybe
just
old
stuff
is
reaching
the
shelves
in
my
part
of
wisconsin
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
mild
tart
mix
along
with
a
gentle
oaky
dryness
pretty
nice
drinkability
a
joy
12
oz
bottle
this
brew
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
half
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
a
nice
film
over
top
of
the
beer
it
has
a
moderate
amount
of
haze
and
there
is
no
carbonation
visable
in
the
light
there
are
some
nice
ruby
highlites
in
the
beer
as
well
the
nose
is
nice
sour
cherry
with
a
very
solid
oak
tannin
and
a
light
tartness
that
adds
a
nice
character
to
it
the
flavor
is
definately
reminding
me
of
the
sour
brown
they
made
a
year
or
so
ago
it
has
a
nice
creamy
character
along
with
a
solid
sour
cherry
in
there
it
finishes
with
a
very
solid
tannin
character
from
the
oak
it
is
tasty
the
feel
is
very
creamy
with
moderate
body
and
a
light
carbonation
it
is
really
smooth
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
i
think
the
oak
character
really
sets
this
one
apart
from
the
other
ng
beers
that
it
is
similar
to
i
will
be
interested
to
see
if
time
makes
any
difference
in
what
this
one
becomes
i
think
it
is
tasty
now
and
could
get
even
better
in
time
enigma
is
not
the
explosively
big
beer
that
i
expected
but
it
makes
up
for
it
with
interesting
subtlety
and
by
simply
being
pleasurable
its
quite
the
hybrid
stylistically
and
goes
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
fruit
beers
flemish
reds
sour
browns
and
barrel
aged
beers
alike
carbonation
was
perfect
allowing
the
finish
to
fade
out
into
a
warm
oaky
aftertaste
a
fascinating
type
and
definitely
worth
trying
out
again
i
think
ill
try
to
pair
it
with
a
juicy
grilled
steak
next
time
drinkabilityoverall
the
oak
aging
has
done
well
to
smooth
out
and
mellow
this
beer
refined
and
tight
as
a
knot
this
is
one
to
drink
at
room
temperature
as
it
retains
a
distracting
metallic
bite
when
chilled

derek

from

minimal

conists
of
tartiness
cherries
vinegar
oak
caramel

red

flavor
starts
off
with
an
aggressive

some

in
the

finish
has
a
good
amount
of
earthiness
and
lingering
sweetness
from
different
malts
tartiness
tames
a
little
as
it
warms
but
more
vinegar
comes
along
with
that
sweet
vinegar
unlike
other
brews
i
have
experienced
in
the
past
where
they
were
overly
sour
decent
brew
but
needs
more
complexity
tart
sour
and
full
of
berries
in
the
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
moderate
to
high
level
of
carbonation
taste
does
not
last
long
could
drink
a
good
amount
of
this
stuff
went
down
easy
at
first
but
gets
a
little
vinegary
later
on
not
overly
sour
or
anything
though
only
other
beer
i
have
had
from
the
brewery
that
produces
the
tasty
kate
the
great
it
was
neither
a
disappointment
or
a
letdown
pretty
average
and
what
i
was
expecting
might
drink
again
worth
trying
reviewed
on
06052009
bottle
sampled
at
pprbsg09
this
beer
pours
brown
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
largely
of
sour
yogurt
the
flavor
is
also
rather
yogurty
as
well
as
lactic
i
dont
detect
a
malt
backbone
at
all
overall
i
really
didnt
like
this
one
much
ill
take
another
very
low
carbonation
somewhat
easy
to
drink
thanks
goes
to
joepais
for
this
brew
highly
drinkable
i
feel
fortunate
to
have
enjoyed
this
one
and
its
quite
a
refreshing
change
from
the
usual
seek
it
out
the
minute
this
stuff
hits
your
tongue
you
feel
the
sourness
even
before
your
taste
buds
kick
in
your
tongue
is
telling
you
that
its
something
special
its
a
nice
tart
dry
taste
along
with
enough
sweetness
to
balance
it
perfectly
it
has
some
citrus
tastes
to
it
and
the
same
response
from
my
mouth
as
when
i
drink
real
grapefruit
juice
it
also
has
a
similarity
to
a
red
wine
this
is
by
no
means
a
strong
beer
despite
its
complexity
its
very
very
drinkable
verdict
a
very
nice
sour
beer
from
tod
mott
and
the
portsmouth
brewery
you
should
seek
it
out
if
you
go
to
the
brewery
sometime
bring
on
the
bugs
and
barrelaging
and
this
beer
would
be
remarkable
a
sour
brown
from
portsmouth
upon
hearing
about
it
i
knew
i
had
to
try
it
and
a
trip
up
to
visit
the
family
for
easter
was
a
perfect
opportunity
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
clear
light
brownamber
color
with
a
thin
quicklydissipating
head
smell
is
tart
with
some
hints
of
vinegar
and
sourness
to
it
a
bit
of
cherry
as
well
taste
is
where
this
brew
shines
though
but
only
if
you
like
sour
brews
if
you
dont
like
sour
beers
you
probably
wont
enjoy
this
one
taste
is
sour
with
hints
of
cherry
and
other
fruit
present
a
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
counters
the
most
fascinating
part
to
me
was
the
hint
of
hop
i
got
from
time
to
time
it
wasnt
on
every
sip
but
a
few
sips
i
would
catch
a
couple
notes
of
a
citric
hoppiness
and
i
can
say
hops
because
it
had
that
distinctive
flavor
that
only
hops
can
give
it
wasnt
due
to
the
sourness
it
was
fascinating
and
made
the
beer
even
better
than
it
already
was
carbonation
was
lively
and
good
and
the
it
drank
smooth
with
a
nice
crisp
finish
i
could
definitely
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
though
with
most
sour
beers
they
can
get
to
be
a
little
much
too
quickly
id
say
this
is
similar
to
a
rodenbach
in
many
respects
different
taste
but
still
quite
good
very
enjoyable
and
another
winner
from
portsmouth
i
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
heard
tod
mott
attempted
a
sour
mashed
beer
hopefully
we
will
see
more
sour
beers
from
the
portsmouth
brewery
in
the
future
di
just
could
not
bring
myself
to
finish
this
beer
i
think
its
great
that
brewers
dig
up
recipes
from
around
the
world
and
give
them
a
try
this
just
does
not
taste
good
at
all
way
too
sour
way
to
acidic
way
to
funky
this
beer
should
probably
be
a
fruit
and
veggie
beer
this
just
cant
be
a
brown
ale
i
think
cherry
stems
are
used
in
making
brune
i
am
not
sure
about
this
bartender
said
this
was
worth
a
try
that
it
was
a
brown
ale
brewed
with
a
sour
mash
pretty
good
beer
it
was
a
hazy
redbrown
color
with
a
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
had
a
sweet
sugary
aroma
the
taste
was
reminiscent
of
those
hard
sour
candies
i
used
to
eat
nice
pucker
factor
not
too
sour
had
a
couple
of
these
and
enjoyed
them
complex
and
interesting
only
mildly
funky
o
a
very
original
take
on
a
flanders
oud
bruin
has
a
tannic
red
wine
characteristic
to
it
that
you
dont
find
as
often
in
the
style
surprisingly
smooth
for
how
strong
and
complex
it
is
nice
but
not
as
dry
and
refreshing
as
other
dark
sours
a
nice
sour
that
is
light
and
maintains
a
little
bit
of
fullness
and
sweetness
the
taste
is
build
up
around
the
yeast
there
is
nice
complex
and
mild
lactic
acid
taste
that
plays
together
well
with
the
light
dark
malt
taste
the
malts
add
a
nice
caramellic
and
molasses
taste
without
giving
a
malt
bitterness
the
yeast
appears
to
be
more
complex
than
just
yeast
it
is
lactic
and
adds
vineous
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
but
the
alcohol
and
tart
flavors
makes
the
beer
a
fullbodied
beer
instead
of
empty
hmmmm
not
the
best
effort
and
hard
to
place
the
aroma
suggests
old
woodaged
beer
with
a
pleasant
acidity
but
the
flavour
is
an
indistinct
mess
i
was
hoping
for
a
more
clearly
defined
character
perhaps
more
wood
and
less
yeast
the
body
also
leaves
you
wanting
more
interesting
and
quite
complex
but
not
the
best
drinking
experience
pick
one
up
if
you
come
across
it
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
the
pour
is
a
murky
brown
color
with
an
offwhite
head
grass
leather
and
vinegar
to
open
things
up
a
bit
of
sweet
dark
fruits
such
as
raisins
and
plums
a
hint
of
metal
is
present
on
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
is
fairly
acetic
with
balsamic
vinegar
aromas
lots
of
leather
grass
and
dark
fruit
a
touch
of
sweetness
gives
it
a
little
balance
high
carbonation
adds
to
drying
feeling
on
the
finish
o
an
allaround
terrible
beer
really
a
bummer
because
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
better
cant
win
them
all
though
o
not
the
best
i
had
for
the
style
but
not
bad
overall
a
solid
flemish
red
overall
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
though
it
has
one
of
the
larger
differences
between
aroma
and
flavor
ive
come
across
in
a
while
the
tartness
is
hardly
noticeable
in
the
aroma
but
is
huge
in
the
flavor
an
interesting
beer
that
isnt
worth
seeking
but
is
worth
a
try
if
you
come
across
it
pours
deep
black
with
dark
brown
on
sides
ruby
reflects
to
the
light
crown
is
dense
brief
so
lacing
does
floral
citric
aromas
intense
sourness
on
palate
light
body
thankfully
the
aftertaste
is
sweety
fruit
drinkable
if
comes
along
with
food
balanced
flavors
aromas
associated
with
wood
aged
oud
bruins
are
missed
overall
a
very
ordinary
not
a
lot
happening
flavour
or
aroma
wise
and
nothing
much
else
there
to
improve
it
overallits
got
some
complex
flavors
but
the
copper
flavors
were
really
not
to
my
taste
im
hoping
that
this
was
just
a
tap
line
problem
purchased
at
bier
temple
in
brussels
and
it
survived
the
trip
home
pours
dark
mahagony
with
plenty
of
carbonation
taste
is
bright
and
tart
with
some
residual
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
definitely
fuller
bodied
than
other
oud
bruins
ive
had
in
short
very
delicious
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
get
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
mainly
cherries
as
well
as
a
lot
of
caramel
and
toffee
malt
the
flavor
is
toffee
and
caramel
malt
which
are
complimented
by
some
lightly
tart
cherries
and
some
dry
cocoa
a
very
nice
mix
that
goes
very
well
the
beer
is
very
dry
and
is
slightly
sour
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
bottle
poured
a
deep
cloudy
brown
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
even
some
lacing
aroma
of
brown
sugar
malt
with
medium
lactic
acid
notes
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
some
tart
and
light
acid
notes
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
body
is
more
full
then
i
was
expecting
with
a
very
solid
malt
backbone
and
caramelized
notes
with
good
carbonation
well
done
and
more
complex
then
a
straightforward
flanders
red
or
oud
bruin
a
wonderful
belgian
flanders
sour
ale
i
wish
i
had
the
larger
portion
of
the
bottle
i
shared
pours
a
lovely
dark
burgundy
color
minimal
head
cherry
notes
and
a
slightly
woodybarrel
quality
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
slightly
tart
and
appropriately
lactic
finish
accentuated
by
the
carbonation
very
nice
and
dont
be
afraid
of
the
yeast
sediment
in
the
dregs
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
poured
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
stemless
snifter
smells
like
i
combined
my
trip
to
cantillon
with
that
to
neuhaus
tastes
like
a
great
young
gueze
with
a
drop
of
old
rasputin
great
find
for
5
at
new
beer
distributors
in
nyc
mf
medium
body
slightly
sweet
a
little
creaminess
in
the
finish
4
5
o
did
not
like
on
the
first
sip
or
two
i
think
that
was
just
shock
as
i
now
think
it
was
quite
delicious
this
thing
needed
to
warm
up
a
few
degrees
from
fridge
temps
like
most
belgians
this
beer
has
just
a
crazy
amount
of
flavor
and
not
just
a
one
trick
pony
of
just
sour
as
it
is
nicely
rounded
by
the
earthy
notes
interesting
beer
i
like
the
dark
ale
component
and
the
sweetness
can
work
as
a
dessert
beer
otherwise
the
sweetness
chemical
fruitiness
acetic
acid
astringent
bitterness
and
lack
of
carbonation
make
this
one
i
will
avoid
in
the
future
o
a
very
interesting
beer
some
aspects
of
a
bsda
but
more
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
very
enjoyable
but
not
for
the
person
that
does
not
enjoy
a
good
tartsour
beer
not
a
bad
sour
not
allagash
coolship
by
any
means
but
pretty
good
while
i
am
away
from
maine
this
is
a
beer
that
wont
overpower
you
but
has
enough
sour
bite
up
front
to
be
worthy
of
another
try
although
it
was
on
the
expensive
side
o
nice
interesting
flanders
the
red
wine
barrel
is
nice
the
stout
notes
are
on
the
fainter
end
but
also
add
a
nice
touch
lots
of
nice
flavors
bouncing
off
of
each
other
the
wine
is
probably
most
prevalent
overall
for
me
but
the
cocoa
roast
malts
sour
ale
and
belgian
yeast
balance
out
nicely
to
make
a
interesting
unique
brew
o
overall
a
well
crafted
brew
the
natural
mustiness
was
welcoming
but
i
think
it
may
have
overpowered
the
base
concoction
the
acidity
and
definitely
the
tartness
was
muted
and
the
flavors
were
not
masterfully
blended
good
but
not
in
the
top
five
very
dark
brown
color
topped
with
a
moderate
frothy
tan
head
fruity
balsamiclike
aroma
sherry
cherries
grapes
blackberries
and
raisins
just
a
bit
of
chocolate
but
otherwise
not
much
from
the
malt
increasing
dry
oaky
notes
as
it
warms
big
time
tart
fruity
flavor
very
silky
and
delightfully
sweet
and
sour
black
cherries
berries
oak
barrel
and
a
little
red
wine
very
soft
floaty
mouthfeel
with
a
solid
lingering
tartness
finishing
dry
sticks
to
the
teeth
excellent
always
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
shot
and
really
love
flanders
beers
but
even
this
one
from
the
area
really
does
not
do
it
for
me
o
this
is
definitely
a
quality
beer
and
quite
unique
in
approach
i
can
imagine
that
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
batch
to
batch
variation
based
on
the
aging
and
blending
methodology
if
you
like
flemish
reds
oud
bruins
and
have
an
open
mind
i
think
you
will
appreciate
this
beer
im
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
the
complex
barrel
aging
protocol
which
i
imagined
would
be
more
apparent
i
guess
its
overshadowed
by
the
tartness
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
and
i
would
love
to
see
how
this
ages
o
intensely
sour
but
luckily
theres
enough
fruit
and
malt
to
keep
it
within
the
bounds
of
drinkability
this
stuff
pours
a
murky
brown
little
head
but
you
can
see
bubbles
present
smells
of
oak
and
something
funky
the
first
sip
is
mouthwatering
unexpectedly
really
fruity
and
sour
superb
sour
flemish
ale
lovely
acidic
tarness
with
lots
of
cherry
tones
not
overly
sour
but
well
balaced
with
oak
and
acidity
wow
superb
it
is
sour
though
dont
get
me
wrong
prob
most
sour
flanders
ive
tried
great
stuff
overall
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
on
this
one
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
im
wondering
if
its
a
little
past
its
prime
given
the
sediment
around
the
top
of
the
bottle
rather
than
on
the
bottom
as
well
as
the
lack
of
oomph
the
cap
had
once
i
popped
it
the
good
thing
about
this
style
though
it
can
be
past
its
prime
and
still
quite
tasty
and
interesting
cheers
man
first
smelling
this
beer
i
knew
it
was
a
great
our
bruin
flemish
sour
smells
of
sour
cherry
with
a
mild
barrel
funk
ending
very
dark
mahogany
in
appearance
nice
white
head
with
a
light
purple
hue
stayed
around
awhile
to
a
thin
lacy
head
a
small
swear
brought
a
little
14
finger
head
back
the
taste
was
what
i
was
hoping
for
sour
cherries
up
front
that
hits
your
back
sides
of
your
toungue
then
the
tart
barrel
funky
sour
hits
the
middle
of
the
tongue
to
finish
hanging
on
at
the
end
is
a
dry
almost
earthy
after
taste
this
was
a
great
beer
a
must
have
if
you
like
this
style
prost
o
in
my
opinion
this
one
is
super
tasty
i
tried
it
on
tap
at
a
little
event
hosted
by
kl
at
gourmet
haus
staud
and
then
noticed
that
kl
had
it
in
bottles
i
can
see
how
some
people
may
be
offended
by
the
mix
of
flavors
or
maybe
they
dont
like
sour
andor
smoky
beers
to
begin
with
but
i
really
enjoy
both
of
those
flavors
and
this
beer
really
puts
the
two
of
them
together
in
a
great
way
ov
it
is
tasty
especially
on
the
finish
but
a
bit
out
of
balance
for
my
liking
just
a
tad
too
sourtart
to
receive
a
higher
rating
still
totally
drinkable
just
not
outstanding
poured
a
brown
body
with
minimal
head
and
had
a
tart
cherry
aroma
as
well
as
some
oakiness
mediumbodied
smooth
thanks
to
oak
slight
sweetness
on
backend
as
well
as
some
woodiness
dominant
profile
is
tartness
of
the
cherry
and
apple
variety
mostly
cherry
i
like
this
beer
as
the
sourtartness
is
the
dominant
taste
profile
but
by
no
means
the
only
profile
as
there
are
some
malts
poking
around
in
this
beer
bottle
from
freebridge
wine
spirits
in
phillipsburg
nj
purchased
sometime
around
may
2013
o
id
like
it
better
with
some
carbonation
but
found
it
to
be
a
very
nice
example
of
an
oud
bruin
similar
to
rodenbach
vintage
better
in
some
ways
and
not
as
good
in
others
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
can
honestly
say
i
love
this
beer
it
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
one
can
experience
it
pours
a
dark
dark
red
which
one
might
mistake
for
a
stout
in
the
right
lighting
cuvee
freddy
has
little
to
no
carbonation
which
gives
it
an
interesting
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
lambic
wine
and
whiskey
due
to
the
oak
barrels
in
which
it
was
aged
friends
of
mine
who
like
even
the
most
bland
of
beers
were
blown
away
by
the
flavor
its
a
shame
i
cannot
find
it
at
any
local
liquor
store
and
have
to
pay
12
a
bottle
at
the
ginger
man
bar
here
in
town
i
hope
they
never
stop
carrying
it
o
this
beer
tastes
more
like
a
sour
and
tart
version
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
compared
to
a
flanders
oud
bruin
but
is
very
complex
and
interesting
a
curious
brew
here
pouring
a
really
dark
red
almost
brown
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
oddly
dark
for
the
style
the
nose
is
lightly
sour
but
more
vinegar
than
anything
tart
cherries
and
yeasty
must
also
resonate
the
flavor
is
sugary
and
fruity
with
the
cherry
becoming
sort
of
artificial
the
funk
to
this
is
really
nice
its
only
minimally
sour
and
the
darker
malts
give
it
some
sweetness
that
is
a
really
nice
contrast
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
if
it
wasnt
so
acidic
this
would
be
relatively
drinkable
i
like
the
bigger
malt
bill
but
this
beer
needs
a
lot
more
carbonation
to
keep
up
with
it
it
comes
across
thin
and
watery
as
a
result
of
inferior
bubbles
overall
not
a
beer
i
will
race
to
drink
again
but
an
intriguing
take
on
a
style
that
really
doesnt
make
it
to
america
in
much
variety
i
appreciate
the
effort
and
am
sure
this
is
much
better
live
at
the
source
thanks
also
to
claystation
for
bringing
this
one
over
reading
other
reviews
it
is
clear
both
that
a
this
beer
is
not
meant
to
be
as
flat
as
it
is
and
b
this
is
a
not
uncommon
problem
with
this
beer
in
the
state
that
i
got
it
it
is
not
particuarly
good
with
the
body
really
being
a
problem
properly
bottled
this
might
be
much
better
overall
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
the
lack
of
carbonation
hurt
this
one
big
time
in
my
opinion
still
a
very
good
brew
but
if
carbonated
could
have
been
excellent
cuvee
freddy
is
an
exquisite
ale
that
seems
to
carry
the
fundamental
complexities
of
flanders
red
ales
and
oude
bruins
but
with
the
aged
earthen
maturity
of
unblended
3year
lambics
its
a
refined
taste
that
deserves
a
sophisticated
palate
for
true
appreciation
63
overall
im
torn
on
this
beer
i
dont
know
whether
i
love
it
or
hate
it
o
i
can
see
why
not
many
would
like
this
one
but
i
certainly
do
like
i
mentioned
before
this
is
the
darkestdeepest
take
on
the
style
i
have
had
with
it
being
almost
so
earthy
i
do
get
essences
of
actual
dirt
strange
but
enjoyable
somehow
it
is
really
not
much
to
look
at
but
the
rest
of
this
beer
shines
much
better
than
the
fresh
draft
verision
great
stuff
and
the
34
years
in
thepeters
cellar
did
great
things
to
this
beer
overall
an
awesome
beer
for
a
flanders
old
brown
this
is
decent
since
it
scratches
on
the
surface
of
what
the
style
could
be
but
unfortunately
there
is
really
no
longevity
to
the
ride
at
least
not
as
much
as
i
would
think
is
appropriate
sure
it
hits
on
the
chracteristics
of
the
style
very
well
but
its
gone
before
you
know
it
and
just
too
thin
overall
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
this
beer
and
its
nice
but
if
only
it
could
have
been
just
a
little
bit
more
wed
be
looking
at
an
amazing
beer
the
flavor
of
this
reminds
one
of
a
whiskey
sour
mixed
drink
just
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
brew
it
had
so
much
potential
but
really
slammed
it
hard
with
the
acidity
steamrolling
any
true
complexity
or
subtlety
that
might
be
there
while
the
elements
themselves
might
be
very
pleasant
it
fails
somewhat
as
an
overall
package
bottle
poured
a
deep
cloudy
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
with
average
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
consists
of
sour
and
tart
notes
mix
in
with
light
sweet
notes
and
some
sherry
taste
is
also
a
nice
mix
between
some
tart
notes
which
are
well
balanced
with
some
notes
of
sherry
and
port
with
a
subtle
vinous
character
body
is
quite
full
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
very
nice
and
not
too
onedimensional
on
the
sour
side
of
things
o
this
is
a
decent
enough
flemish
brown
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
an
even
more
intense
assertive
flavor
profile
and
a
bit
more
chewiness
in
the
mouth
though
its
a
little
too
slick
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
aboveaverage
take
on
the
style
eh
could
wear
it
as
a
cologne
not
really
but
i
guess
ill
just
drink
and
enjoy
it
also
not
really
skål
d
all
day
long
easily
i
ran
16
miles
before
i
went
to
ebenezers
and
i
wish
this
was
at
the
finish
line
ready
for
some
thirst
quenching
served
from
bottle
into
a
duckrabbit
stemmed
snifter
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
basically
black
with
a
minimal
light
tan
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
tart
cherry
acetic
acid
and
tart
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
cherry
caramel
wood
and
subtle
sour
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
this
brew
really
threw
me
off
as
it
smelled
as
if
it
would
be
much
more
sourtart
than
it
actually
was
this
one
did
have
the
tartsour
aspect
going
on
but
it
was
not
the
dominant
flavor
in
it
at
all
the
flavors
that
were
present
really
did
a
nice
job
of
working
together
and
enhancing
one
another
just
wish
there
would
have
been
a
little
bit
of
the
acetic
acid
present
that
i
picked
up
on
in
the
aroma
defintely
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
opportunity
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
and
the
most
wine
influenced
beer
i
have
ever
sampled
i
wish
i
got
more
of
the
base
beer
here
but
i
enjoyed
how
the
sour
beer
flavors
worked
with
the
wine
barrel
aging
would
have
liked
more
bodycarbonation
but
the
wine
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
i
guess
for
a
red
vinous
tasting
beer
smells
really
good
but
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sloppy
it
starts
to
be
allovertheplace
this
is
still
a
good
surprise
since
this
is
certainly
a
beer
id
pass
on
if
i
saw
it
on
shelves
actually
id
probably
never
notice
it
on
shelves
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
it
never
once
felt
even
near
8
it
has
decent
drinkability
and
a
fair
blend
of
flavors
overall
not
bad
overall
a
good
flanders
and
one
id
honestly
pick
up
in
the
future
to
see
what
age
would
do
to
it
im
in
the
process
of
trying
to
find
rr
replacements
now
that
im
back
in
il
and
this
one
may
have
to
do
for
a
consecration
also
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
carbonation
overall
this
is
really
quite
nice
great
roast
malt
base
compliments
the
tart
components
wellbalanced
no
elements
outpacing
the
others
i
have
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
i
got
an
undercarbed
bottle
will
have
to
try
this
again
definitely
worth
seeking
out
o
reminds
me
a
lot
of
orval
which
i
love
light
bodied
but
complex
and
surprisingly
strong
for
an
8er
its
drinkability
is
enhanced
by
the
softening
of
the
sour
flavor
in
the
drying
finish
let
it
linger
on
your
tongue
and
youll
also
notice
hints
of
leather
and
dark
skinned
fruit
overall
this
is
an
aggressive
and
slightly
acidic
beer
that
serves
as
a
noteworthy
example
of
its
style
d
in
spite
of
some
rough
spots
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
pour
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
minimal
head
though
there
is
a
thin
collar
throughout
and
some
spots
form
after
a
good
swirl
the
nose
brings
some
slight
roast
along
with
a
good
cherry
presence
some
lactic
acid
and
a
moderate
amount
of
oak
the
flavor
is
fairly
acidic
with
a
good
oak
and
tannin
presence
the
darker
portion
of
the
blend
is
noticeable
with
some
roast
the
finish
is
fairly
sour
but
also
has
some
good
roast
a
bit
of
acetone
though
only
in
the
finish
not
more
than
is
worth
docking
5
points
for
overall
really
solid
glad
to
see
this
on
tap
two
blocks
from
home
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
wish
i
got
more
cherry
flavor
and
a
bit
more
tartness
that
said
it
has
some
nice
funky
notes
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
and
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
it
in
the
future
cheers
really
nice
stuff
wish
i
had
more
d
i
liked
this
flanders
a
lot
i
really
enjoy
tart
cherries
and
sour
dark
fruits
so
the
smell
was
great
to
me
would
like
to
try
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownishred
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
toffee
lightly
tart
cherries
and
oak
very
inviting
the
flavor
is
tart
cherries
oak
and
vanilla
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
lightly
sour
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
d
i
think
i
might
could
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
this
if
i
tried
and
i
might
one
day
i
gotta
try
that
oak
podge
and
the
one
brewed
with
mustard
seed
now
d
lovely
stuff
mildly
sour
and
rich
with
a
nice
complex
depth
d
a
quality
sour
beer
here
from
alvinne
never
thought
id
get
to
try
it
good
drinkablity
i
never
knew
it
was
8
flavor
is
really
strange
not
bad
at
all
infact
its
definitely
tasty
with
that
said
not
great
either
theres
a
solid
sour
taste
which
was
expected
from
the
aroma
but
the
coffee
is
combatting
the
flavor
adding
a
strange
characteristic
medium
body
medium
carbonation
booze
isnt
really
noticed
an
interesting
and
tasty
beer
grab
a
bottle
if
you
see
it
just
to
taste
it
for
yourself
o
overall
its
a
sour
brown
ale
as
described
on
the
bottle
it
is
not
a
whole
lot
more
than
that
however
the
mushroom
flavors
are
slightly
intriguing
i
really
have
not
had
too
many
beers
that
capture
musky
mushroom
essence
more
than
this
and
i
think
this
makes
a
good
base
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
drink
more
of
them
with
many
other
options
available
being
a
huge
fan
of
the
flanders
oud
bruin
style
i
would
much
rather
have
an
aardmonik
earthmonk
any
day
of
the
week
as
if
it
were
available
sour
like
vinegar
and
i
get
a
taste
of
soy
worth
a
try
picture
an
oak
tree
surrounded
by
mushrooms
on
a
vineyard
that
also
produces
apple
cider
vinegar
thats
what
this
beer
tastes
like
and
its
delicious
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
good
sour
with
natural
earthy
undertones
serving
type
bottle
simply
excellent
o
an
interesting
beer
wild
natural
earthy
tart
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
expected
this
to
be
a
flop
its
actually
something
that
most
sour
beer
fans
should
try
very
educational
and
actually
quite
tasty
o
i
may
not
have
tried
everything
in
the
oude
world
but
i
know
what
i
like
i
think
i
have
a
new
favorite
sour
a
really
beautiful
and
authentic
oud
bruin
its
been
far
too
long
since
i
had
a
good
one
this
is
just
awesome
dark
brown
with
some
dark
red
shades
when
held
to
the
light
and
almost
a
full
inch
of
lasting
khaki
head
thick
and
airy
it
seems
real
sour
lacto
fermented
tangy
acidic
funky
with
a
rich
and
semisweet
brown
malt
profile
with
minimal
roast
bitterness
but
lots
of
depth
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
nose
with
a
profound
lemony
sting
on
the
swallow
the
malt
gives
more
body
than
flavor
while
the
acidity
is
the
driver
here
tartness
and
sourness
both
clean
through
and
not
a
palate
scorcher
by
any
means
layers
of
dried
fruit
come
in
too
raisins
and
cherries
to
be
specific
while
the
acidity
never
loosens
its
puckery
grip
medium
bodied
and
carbonated
brilliantly
this
beer
comes
across
lighter
than
it
is
as
a
result
it
really
perks
me
up
too
with
a
shocking
sort
of
mouth
eel
still
elegant
through
very
very
well
made
i
have
overlooked
this
way
too
long
for
six
bucks
there
may
not
be
a
better
example
of
the
style
out
there
the
beer
pours
with
a
fierce
hissing
carbonation
that
forms
a
head
of
medium
sized
offwhite
bubbles
that
quickly
fizzles
into
nothing
leaving
a
clean
and
calm
top
of
the
beer
without
any
head
carbonation
bubbles
continue
to
tear
to
the
top
of
the
glass
however
and
appear
reminiscent
of
highly
carbonated
soda
bubbles
in
color
the
beer
is
a
deep
ruby
brown
almost
maroon
with
a
distinct
ruby
glow
in
the
light
the
beers
body
is
slightly
viscous
with
a
darkness
that
makes
it
opaque
though
the
beer
appears
clean
of
any
particles
or
cloudiness
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
green
apples
malt
vinegar
cherry
fruit
leather
and
fresh
strawberry
jam
rich
funky
scents
cover
the
nose
from
this
beer
blending
with
the
light
malt
character
to
bring
a
touch
of
plum
raisins
and
a
soft
trace
of
toffee
touches
of
sherry
coincide
with
the
rich
smell
of
strawberry
jam
which
is
quite
bizarre
yet
inviting
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
tart
with
lactic
and
malic
acidity
traces
of
malty
sweetness
run
across
the
tongue
and
a
very
faint
touch
of
roasted
bitters
can
be
sensed
in
the
finish
balance
is
slightly
tart
but
nice
and
not
assaulting
on
the
tongue
fruit
esters
are
strong
and
complex
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
tart
green
apple
then
cherry
pie
then
cherry
fruit
leather
malt
vinegar
does
work
its
way
into
the
flavor
along
with
sherrylike
notes
in
the
midpalate
just
as
the
beer
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
sweet
and
sour
sauce
flavor
can
be
sensed
along
with
some
of
the
strawberry
jam
from
the
nose
on
the
finish
the
beer
softens
its
tartness
enough
to
bring
soft
coffee
caramel
roast
and
a
touch
of
barnyard
funk
on
the
tongue
alongside
the
fruit
esters
providing
a
beautiful
finish
that
lasts
for
quite
a
while
on
the
tongue
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
medium
bodied
with
a
middling
carbonation
that
carries
a
bit
of
a
prickle
and
a
touch
of
astringency
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
after
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
wet
and
gently
puckering
overall
i
really
like
this
oud
bruin
this
beer
has
a
great
funky
character
a
nice
balance
and
finishes
with
a
great
malt
presence
that
really
pulls
together
the
beer
and
provides
for
a
fascinating
sip
i
would
love
to
pair
this
beer
with
richer
meals
to
see
how
the
acidity
and
malt
play
with
food
this
is
a
great
beer
with
perfect
complexity
for
the
style
o
this
beer
has
a
lot
more
tartness
and
vinegarlike
flavors
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
is
interesting
to
drink
if
you
enjoy
sourness
and
tartness
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
perceptible
overall
i
would
and
will
buy
this
again
when
i
have
the
chance
this
is
a
great
sour
ale
and
a
great
oude
bruin
it
is
not
really
complex
but
it
has
a
really
good
amount
of
interest
to
it
so
i
cannot
complain
too
much
and
the
sour
hit
this
delivers
is
well
very
well
achieved
it
does
not
hit
with
vinegar
to
cause
the
sour
it
relies
on
other
very
high
quality
traits
to
lay
it
on
you
and
that
is
what
i
appreciate
and
enjoy
the
most
no
gimmicks
just
plain
well
achieved
cheers
smells
kinda
sharp
and
acetic
from
the
bottle
but
out
of
the
glass
its
much
more
rounded
more
of
a
lactic
sourness
for
sure
ripe
red
berries
yogurt
and
hints
of
balsamic
vinegar
in
both
the
nose
and
flavor
intensely
sour
but
deliciously
full
fruitiness
rounds
it
out
would
definitely
buy
again
especially
considering
the
modest
price
a
nice
sour
for
the
4
99
price
tag
damn
what
a
shame
a
load
of
vinegar
and
overthetop
tartness
hits
after
the
first
several
sips
it
certainly
calms
down
from
that
as
time
goes
on
but
the
vinegar
still
remains
a
bit
too
high
its
too
bad
i
love
this
style
and
see
it
so
rarely
i
really
hope
that
this
was
an
off
bottle
overall
not
my
favorite
but
still
a
really
tasty
brew
it
has
more
dark
fruit
flavors
than
most
oud
bruins
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
id
recommend
picking
up
a
bottle
overall
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
mildly
sour
flanders
red
this
was
a
lot
more
sour
than
expected
and
i
loved
it
ill
be
grabbing
more
on
monday
in
portland
finish
follows
flavor
and
is
a
nice
lemonlimeacidic
quality
that
lingers
with
freshness
and
brightness
it
is
quite
acidic
even
burns
my
sensitive
stomach
it
is
pretty
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
big
fan
of
sours
and
it
did
not
disapoint
actually
if
i
sip
it
its
rather
interesting
but
its
certainly
extreme
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
o
alvinne
undressed
is
a
solid
and
well
made
beer
very
drinkable
not
pricy
not
complicated
but
good
id
drink
one
and
cellar
one
to
compare
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
which
i
do
of
course
ive
been
lucky
enough
to
have
2008
10
and
12
and
this
is
beer
is
perfect
it
was
okay
but
for
the
style
it
fell
short
probably
works
for
most
just
not
in
my
wheel
house
go
deschutes
o
a
solid
beer
overall
id
like
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
balance
but
overall
is
enjoyable
abyss
had
recently
disappointed
me
so
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
about
this
beer
but
it
exceeded
my
expectations
and
then
some
its
fantastic
an
excellentto
my
thinking
and
tastes
oud

2014
reserve

great
sour
brown
with
red

biscuit
yeast
leather
and
earthy
notes
somewhat
dry
finish
from
the
oak
will
benefit
from
another
year
a
rather
pleasant
and
engaging
woodtreated
version
of
the

its
not
going
to
challenge
rodenbach
or
the
duchesse
but
instead
sit
next
to
them
in
the
limited
pantheon
of
sour
flemish
ales
available
around
here
fruity
certainly
and
yet
balanced
especially
when
it
comes
to
addressing
that
elephant
kicking
back
in
the
middle
of
the
room
no
im
not
seeing
things
yeah
the
21
proof
booze
is
really
hard
to
come
by
it
would
seem
2012
vintage
nice
cherry
and
acidic
fruit
notes
deep
and
complex
glad
i
waited
a
couple
of
years
i
didnt
see
this
as
the
style
its
described
as
more
pinot
flavor
than
anything
not
much
acidity
or
tartness
ill
revisit
this
again
after
the
best
after
date
2012
vintage
aged
at
53
f
since
purchase
consumed
22115
sublime
looks
and
smells
the
part
but
boozybitter
city
with
slight
tart
and
slight
cherry
nothing
to
write
home
over
2014
vintage
but
didnt
wait
until
enjoy
after
date
compared
to
befuddlement
this
is
literally
bland
and
more
like
a
red
ale
not
a
sour
so
glad
this
will
be
an
annual
release
now
opened
a
2014
bottle
and
it
was
everything
i
remember
from
5
years
ago
and
more
truly
special
beer
finally
after
years
on
my
wants
listgot
one
in
shoprite
fairless
hills
this
is
a
nice
tart
beer
with
notable
wine
characteristics
a
bit
of
diacetyl
on
the
flavor
was
slightly
offputting
but
it
had
plenty
of
other
positive
notes
to
offset
that
this
had
a
best
after
date
of
about
9
months
in
the
future
so
im
looking
forward
to
cracking
open
my
2
other
bottles
down
the
road
so
close
to
being
so
awesome
needs
a
little
more
pucker
more
something
i
liked
it
but
i
think
it
needs
more
i
dont
know
time
sourness
i
really
like
the
cherry
flavor
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
think
it
needs
something
more
to
make
it
memorable
golden
amber
beer
with
thin
soapy
head
and
great
clarity
some
burnt
sugars
sour
cherry
fruit
salad
pineapple
tangerine
with
a
slick
oily
mouthfeel
for
the
price
i
paid
and
the
abv
and
the
style
this
beer
ale
sour
wine
like
drink
is
surprisingly
quaffable
yet
the
next
time
you
bring
it
to
your
lips
you
want
to
savor
it
worth
the
price
depends
on
your
curiosity
im
not
a
rich
man
and
i
can
say
im
happy
i
bought
this
o
this
is
my
favorite
descutes
beer
and
consistent
at
that
i
can
see
gains
with
age
but
its
not
hot
now
like
a
fresh
abyss
way
better
than
abyss
and
not
carrying
that
hype
its
a
great
take
on
a
flanders
oude
bruin
slightly
phenolic
flavor
wish
it
were
more
sour
really
enjoyable
interesting
beer
not
overly
sour
and
alot
going
on
with
aroma
and
on
the
palate
drinks
just
about
as
easy
as
the
lower
abv
brothers
of
this
style
ill
drink
this
over
abyss
any
day
a
great
beer
from
deschutes
2014
maybe
it
needs
some
age
no
real
tartness
for
me
on
this
cherries
come
through
nice
as
does
the
wine
barrel
just
not
my
style
at
this
point
big
wine
character
in
the
taste
the
aroma
leads
with
big
cherry
notes
and
in
the
taste
you
get
some
cherry
in
the
front
and
a
slight
puckering
effect
at
the
end
i
know
this
gets
better
with
age
this
has
a
complex
yet
cohesive
profile
the
wild
blend
opens
the
pallet
to
the
tart
fruit
cherry
and
closes
with
a
suddle
dry
flavor
of
the
oak
barrels
i
enjoyed
the
2014
reserve
and
would
gladly
buy
again
a
whole
lot
of
wine
shines
here
even
though
on
35
of
it
sits
in
pinot
noir
barrels
not
enough
cherry
as
expected
beautiful
deep
red
and
brown
with
a
very
light
cream
color
head
a
bit
heavy
in
the
nought
and
lingers
forever
in
the
back
very
good
but
was
hoping
for
something
more
from
the
barrel
and
the
cherries
shared
2
bottles
of
2012
vintage
at
a
local
pub
if
you
like
the
more
fruity
element
drink
fresh
if
you
dont
mind
losing
a
little
fresh
fruit
to
get
some
more
flavors
and
rounded
out
beer
go
for
2
years
i
had
the
2010
reserve
when
buying
the
2014
and
thought
it
had
fallen
off
considerably
overall
4
25
a
really
nice
take
on
the
style
with
the
cherries
giving
it
a
bit
of
a
kriek
feel
but
a
bit
sweeter
from
the
base
beer
than
youd
get
from
a
kriek
probably
my
favorite
individual
beer
of
the
group
of
beers
that
make
up
collage
o
an
excellent
sour
recommended
to
any
fans
of
any
of
the
sour
beer
styles
one
of
deschutes
best
overall
very
good
sour
beer
not
lippuckering
sour
but
very
drinkable
the
aroma
gives
off
a
bourbon
hint
but
the
beer
was
not
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
and
each
taste
is
a
little
surprise
with
the
different
flavors
in
the
beer
o
this
is
an
incredible
beer
highly
recommended
want
to
have
again
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
like
it
the
level
of
complexity
in
the
flavor
is
impressive
and
the
feel
is
a
perfect
complement
an
excellent
robust
sour
o
this
was
good
but
i
didnt
like
as
much
as
most
a
bit
too
much
red
wine
and
the
cherry
flavor
was
medicinal
for
me
good
but
not
exceptional
russian
river
supplication
has
been
surpassed
this
is
masterful
will
have
to
grab
more
than
one
bottle
the
next
time
they
release
ive
really
been
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
and
it
didnt
disappoint
super
complex
and
balanced
very
well
done
deschutes
4
years
has
done
wonders
the
alcohol
is
decently
hidden
but
still
shines
through
as
something
that
is
quite
big
11
is
not
a
huge
surprise
however
i
prefer
the
beers
in
the
style
to
be
less
alcoholic
and
more
refreshing
still
a
wonderfully
complex
and
delicious
beer
excellent
beer
the
tartness
and
fruit
works
well
nice
stuff
hazed
red
colour
ring
of
off
white
head
not
much
in
the
way
of
lace
either
smell
is
full
of
cherry
and
oak
vinious
and
fruity
red
berry
alcohol
at
points
and
some
maltwheat
as
well
taste
is
of
cherry
but
also
fairly
malty
before
getting
to
oak
and
tart
fruits
drying
sour
berry
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
flavours
on
the
back
end
medium
drying
carbonation
medium
body
quite
good
but
i
feel
this
would
benefit
from
a
bit
more
time
but
would
have
it
again
gladly
anytime
d
great
to
drink
i
really
like
this
one
oa
nice
effort
this
brew
is
quite
drinkable
for
11
4
abv
i
originally
was
hoping
for
more
tart
flavors
but
after
about
two
sips
i
started
to
really
enjoy
the
less
sweet
for
the
style
maltforward
character
it
is
complex
and
balanced
and
the
taste
really
grew
on
me
im
not
sure
what
food
this
would
pair
with
but
it
drank
well
on
its
own
after
dinner
this
is
a
great
and
powerful
take
on
the
style
like
the
abyss
this
is
a
testament
to
making
a
complex
11
beer
very
subtle
lowend
sourness
and
acidity
sets
this
apart
some
for
the
style
and
lets
the
wine
barrel
show
through
a
bit
more
authentic
flanders
fruit
vinegar
feel
mixed
with
nice
belgian
yeast
spice
and
some
good
darker
sugar
flavors
like
the
wine
grape
and
oak
complexity
abv
is
also
nonexistent
i
rather
liked
this
brew
and
would
love
to
try
an
aged
bottle
or
other
vintages
in
all
honesty
the
only
reason
this
one
made
it
past
its
best
after
date
is
i
forgot
i
had
one
o
apart
from
the
feel
which
was
just
above
average
this
was
an
outstanding
beer
glad
i
waited
to
drink
it
although
i
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
fresh
overall
better
color
development
of
legs
oak
and
wine
coming
through
much
stronger
on
nose
and
taste
sweeter
finish
better
feel
has
definitely
improved
through
the
aging
and
very
nicely
cant
wait
to
get
more
this
year
ill
re
review
a
third
time
when
i
open
the
third
o
incredibly
flavourful
with
a
high
voltage
abv
that
goes
completely
undetected
a
true
privilege
to
have
had
the
chance
to
enjoy
it
and
an
even
more
stoked
to
share
it
with
my
ba
bro
in
crime
o
a
true
original
so
tasty
and
easy
drinking
a
must
try
for
any
beer
advocate
overall
really
good
if
not
a
little
overly
acidic
for
me
i
find
it
so
powerful
that
it
has
to
be
a
special
occasion
beer
it
lacks
the
accessibility
of
some
of
the
less
potent
sour
cherry
ales
but
accessible
is
not
something
its
going
for
o
this
is
one
knockout
of
a
sour
but
its
so
subtle
in
its
execution
a
slow
sipper
but
every
one
is
a
delight
o
awesome
appearance
and
awesome
aroma
but
it
immensely
lacks
in
balance
taste
and
mouthfeel
very
happy
to
split
this
bottle
with
one
other
person
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
brew
and
getting
better
as
it
warms
sweet
but
not
overdone
much
lighter
tasting
than
the
alcohol
would
lead
you
to
believe
since
im
completely
dumfounded
here
ill
guess
its
so
sort
of
american
barleywine
but
i
dont
feel
confident
about
it
a
very
enjoyable
beer
even
if
its
a
month
before
its
best
after
date
o
not
bad
but
nothing
to
recommend
this
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
syrupy
looking
auburn
with
no
head
or
carbonation
the
nose
is
a
tad
tart
sweet
with
notes
of
raisin
and
candi
sugar
masked
booze
and
no
bitterness
the
taste
is
definitely
modestly
tart
sweet
a
touch
of
cherry
and
raisin
in
the
finish
no
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
sweet
upfront
slightly
tart
no
bitterness
and
only
very
slightly
dry
finish
this
beer
is
excellent
and
almost
like
a
rodenbach
on
steroids
o
this
is
a
darn
good
boozy
oaky
and
tart
beer
medium
body
decent
carbonation
bubbly
and
dry
on
the
tongue
a
top
tier
flanders
oud
bruin
with
a
decent
balance
between
the
higher
abv
and
fairly
aggressive
dark
sourness
this
poured
out
as
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
soapy
looking
head
fades
and
leaves
a
ring
of
foam
around
the
edge
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
tart
on
the
nose
some
really
nice
cherry
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
tart
and
sour
there
is
some
sweetness
in
tere
as
well
that
is
a
little
on
the
syrupy
side
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
with
a
medium
body
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
feel
it
could
be
a
little
more
sour
its
still
a
pretty
good
brew
theres
some
interesting
things
going
on
here
but
first
sip
was
a
bit
of
a
strange
shock
and
quite
odd
it
does
have
some
good
qualities
to
it
and
a
future
visit
might
be
in
the
cards
but
by
no
means
my
favorite
bruin
at
all
strange
aftertaste
obviously
im
in
a
festive
mood
happy
500
everybody
this
is
definitely
a
nice
treat
and
at
11
it
should
be
treated
as
such
its
not
as
sour
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
which
makes
me
want
to
age
the
second
bottle
for
a
couple
years
o
overall
this
was
a
tasty
beer
from
deschutes
wish
it
was
more
sour
but
it
was
still
worth
checking
out
overall
while
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
to
me
it
seemed
like
a
lesser
version
of
supplication
by
rr
still
good
just
not
great
verdict
a
decent
flanders
red
from
deschutes
lacking
in
complexity
and
subtlety
as
the
harsh
sour
and
vinegar
qualities
really
dominate
this
beer
at
times
im
left
wishing
the
cherry
flavors
came
across
as
fresh
fruit
rather
than
dried
as
they
never
really
pop
my
one
praise
is
that
you
would
never
know
its
11
4
as
the
alcohol
is
artfully
hidden
from
notes
12910
pours
a
brownish
red
color
with
a
somewhat
fizzy
head
beige
head
dissipates
quickly
it
might
be
starting
to
thin
out
a
bit
but
this
beer
is
still
quite
good
lots
of
fruit
sour
cherries
and
berries
some
vinegar
and
acid
medium
sour
soft
feel
a
very
good
beer
though
not
quite
up
to
the
best
of
this
wonderful
style
edit
2010
version
draft
very
good
again
much
more
funky
oak
flavor
than
i
remember
from
the
last
batch
very
woody
dry
sort
of
a
cheesy
flavor
sour
cherries
are
delicious
and
dont
overwhelm
refined
and
complex
full
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
of
dissident
is
noticeably
best
from
a
fresh
keg
in
my
opinion
not
too
sour
yet
edit
2012
my
opinion
on
dissident
has
gone
done
somewhat
it
seems
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
flavor
is
muddier
than
i
remember
ill
revisit
this
review
again
at
some
point
but
im
lowering
my
scores
for
now
got
a
bottle
at
tacoma
boys
says
2012
on
the
label
cool
packaging
with
the
makers
mark
style
wax
covering
but
was
kind
of
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
open
aromas
of
vinegar
very
sharp
and
sour
fragrance
amber
orange
in
color
with
a
tan
head
that
doesnt
sustain
very
long
but
leaves
nice
lace
on
top
can
tell
its
highly
carbonated
as
it
look
and
sounds
explosive
wow
this
is
a
bomb
to
the
palate
heavy
alcohol
notes
very
tart
and
light
sourness
the
alcohol
has
an
immediate
warming
effect
fruity
sour
apple
and
cherry
flavors
alot
of
red
wine
in
the
mix
as
well
i
dont
care
for
the
aftertaste
its
very
metallic
and
just
off
somehow
too
bad
maybe
not
as
carbonated
as
it
looks
at
first
but
i
think
it
lost
alot
of
it
sitting
in
the
glass
very
interesting
beer
and
i
love
the
primary
flavor
just
dont
like
the
finish
o
this
was
very
enjoyable
but
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
happens
over
the
next
year
or
so
at
present
it
just
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
flavor
im
looking
for
and
expecting
but
i
was
so
far
before
the
best
after
date
i
have
high
hopes
o
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
this
and
i
dont
know
if
i
ever
will
again
i
only
had
enough
money
for
one
bottle
and
i
may
let
that
stand
as
the
greatest
beer
where
ive
only
had
money
for
1
bottle
o
another
a
grade
beer
from
deschutes
fire
m
medium
body
creamy
light
carbonation
lovely
stuff
o
this
bottle
is
9months
shy
of
its
best
after
date
so
it
needs
a
little
age
it
is
kinda
harsh
but
where
it
is
going
is
fantastic
can
mostly
taste
the
sour
not
much
maltyness
overall
nice
and
big
flanders
style
sour
with
a
good
amount
of
fruit
flavour
anxious
to
try
the
3
biyear
vertical
in
the
cellar
now
high
b
great
beer
o
pretty
good
not
a
sour
as
id
hoped
but
really
like
how
the
oak
comes
through
and
how
forward
the
vanilla
is
excited
to
give
it
a
try
after
the
best
by
date
overall
this
is
the
best
american
take
on
the
oud
bruin
style
ive
had
it
is
delicious
and
well
balanced
at
this
age
though
i
wonder
how
it
was
after
a
year
i
enjoy
the
prominent
acidity
so
i
definitely
want
to
hold
onto
a
2012
or
two
to
have
in
2016
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
2012
version
best
after
82013
this
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
fizzy
tan
head
which
fizzes
away
to
a
little
film
the
smells
are
great
you
get
some
obvious
sour
notes
vinegar
a
load
of
cherries
some
barnyard
funk
some
white
grape
some
obvious
alcohol
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
amazing
deschutes
knows
how
to
make
a
beer
you
get
some
bitterness
a
little
brett
some
sour
notes
vinegar
some
cherries
the
alcohol
is
also
present
though
and
a
little
age
wouldnt
hurt
this
o
deschutes
does
it
again
man
this
is
one
bad
ass
beer
that
instantly
becomes
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
beer
after
the
best
after
date
cheers
overall
a
damn
fine
sour
beer
a
couple
years
back
i
took
a
chance
on
this
when
i
saw
it
on
tap
and
i
was
both
surprised
by
and
impressed
with
this
beer
this
beer
certainly
opened
my
eyes
to
a
portion
of
the
beer
world
i
had
been
missing
out
on
and
it
remains
my
favorite
oud
bruin
of
those
that
ive
tried
overall
such
a
well
balanced
flanders
oud
bruin
especially
for
its
strength
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
the
cherries
used
in
brewing
definitely
come
out
and
add
to
this
beer
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
savor
it
is
delicious
and
gets
even
better
as
it
warms
after
opening
o
wish
i
would
have
had
this
a
year
or
so
ago
not
sure
how
this
is
fresh
but
i
think
this
beer
is
well
past
its
peak
wow
this
is
one
amazing
beer
the
taste
is
so
far
from
what
a
typical
beer
is
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
beer
there
are
so
many
tastes
and
flavors
that
i
cant
pick
anything
out
to
describe
i
drank
from
a
bottle
so
i
dont
know
what
its
appearance
is
like
this
is
not
just
another
craft
beer
that
tastes
like
just
hops
this
is
beer
art
conceptual
art
applied
to
beer
beer
taken
to
an
extreme
that
makes
it
something
else
but
still
keeping
with
the
primacy
of
what
beer
is
this
is
my
favorite
beer
sadly
i
have
moved
from
the
west
coast
and
i
cant
find
anything
from
oregon
i
even
love
the
packaging
its
art
also
overall
a
really
great
belgian
style
sour
big
fruity
wine
like
flavors
while
the
acidity
and
sourness
is
kept
in
check
very
complex
and
good
tasting
overall
it
was
decent
but
i
was
a
little
bit
dissapointed
by
this
beer
i
think
i
need
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
to
give
it
a
fair
shot
overall
good
beer
that
i
suspect
will
improve
with
some
age
i
have
a
feeling
deschutes
best
after
date
is
really
appropriate
for
this
one
pours
caramel
with
a
slight
amber
hue
and
a
small
khaki
head
smells
lacto
sour
brown
sugar
cherries
and
apples
a
slight
hint
of
some
vanilla
and
the
wine
barrels
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
amazing
flavor
and
quite
complex
some
sour
lacto
tart
cherries
apple
a
little
funky
the
barrels
and
some
leather
i
expected
more
alcohol
to
be
noticeable
than
there
actually
was
which
was
a
nice
surprise
a
crisp
active
mouthfeel
overall
a
really
nice
beer
even
11
months
prior
to
its
best
after
date
i
can
only
imagine
how
good
it
will
be
then
pours
amber
with
a
cherry
hue
etched
surface
with
a
rim
of
light
cream
foam
the
smell
was
evident
from
a
couple
feet
upon
pouring
really
richly
cherry
this
year
there
are
notes
of
lacto
breat
and
oak
with
plenty
of
the
wine
character
coming
through
and
lots
of
nice
tart
cherries
the
flavor
is
tart
up
front
with
a
bit
of
heat
and
plenty
of
cherry
flavor
this
is
really
remarkable
in
that
it
is
very
very
fruit
forward
and
most
in
the
style
that
ive
had
are
more
oak
balanced
i
think
i
prefer
this
approach
the
tartness
is
not
quite
sour
per
se
but
is
richly
enhancing
the
overall
tone
of
the
beer
there
is
much
much
less
wood
and
grain
perceived
this
year
than
2010
when
fresh
medium
on
light
syrup
body
with
limited
soft
and
fine
carb
with
a
watering
finish
nice
beer
i
am
really
glad
i
got
a
good
stash
of
this
vintage
overall
a
great
beer
to
be
sure
but
im
not
blown
away
by
it
like
i
was
hoping
to
be
perhaps
is
as
good
as
its
supposed
to
be
and
ive
only
grown
as
an
advocate
i
would
love
to
have
it
again
and
again
i
almost
wish
i
would
have
drank
it
fresher
to
see
if
there
would
have
been
a
difference
but
i
dont
feel
that
it
lost
too
much
based
upon
reviews
ive
read
o
definitely
a
good
beer
and
well
worth
the
13
hopefully
some
age
will
bring
out
some
more
sour
notes
it
smells
great
but
the
taste
was
not
as
puckering
as
id
hoped
it
would
be
still
an
excellent
beer
i
have
a
lot
of
mixed
emotions
about
this
beer
its
smells
wonderfully
of
cherry
and
the
nose
on
it
is
very
complex
whispers
of
alcohol
permeate
from
the
snifter
i
am
using
the
faint
foamy
head
dissipates
quickly
my
first
drink
into
this
beer
tells
me
this
moment
is
going
to
be
quite
awkward
my
palate
has
cherry
oak
sweet
caramel
and
a
flush
of
acidity
almost
like
a
deep
red
wine
such
as
a
shiraz
it
seems
to
be
lacking
of
carbonation
and
has
almost
medicinal
qualities
while
i
am
not
found
of
this
beer
i
can
appreciate
the
creativity
and
artistry
it
takes
to
develop
a
product
such
as
this
best
after
82013
pours
a
hazy
reddish
amber
with
a
red
tinged
bubbly
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nose
is
tart
cherries
pinot
noir
woody
slight
vanilla
french
oak
you
can
actually
smell
the
difference
between
french
and
american
oak
black
plums
dark
fruit
and
some
spice
notes
taste
is
cherries
grapes
green
apples
oak
plums
red
wine
booze
and
a
bit
of
some
kind
of
spice
maybe
cinnamon
or
clove
something
with
a
kick
this
was
the
first
sour
ale
i
ever
tried
the
2010
vintage
and
it
blew
my
mind
its
just
as
good
as
i
remember
im
psyched
about
the
two
i
have
put
away
til
after
83013
its
a
long
wait
but
itll
be
worth
it
i
can
definitely
taste
the
parts
of
this
that
were
in
that
collage
i
had
last
night
deschutes
rules
m
medium
bodied
but
feels
fuller
because
of
slight
lack
of
carbonation
maybe
some
time
in
bottle
with
help
that
overall
a
fantastic
sour
filled
with
vinous
and
berry
notes
with
some
citric
notes
creeping
in
big
and
just
a
little
oaky
this
one
will
age
with
the
best
of
them
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
develops
after
a
year
or
two
buy
several
drink
one
and
cellar
the
rest
just
one
of
those
classics
for
me
it
looks
a
little
thin
light
brown
color
with
a
red
hue
to
it
good
carbonation
is
obvious
as
a
fizzy
white
head
rises
up
the
nose
is
intense
lots
of
red
wine
vibes
although
this
isnt
barrel
aged
in
vino
also
lots
of
sour
in
the
aroma
brett
and
lacto
at
least
but
this
isnt
acidic
there
is
some
sweetness
in
the
flavor
from
the
malt
and
that
red
fruit
tone
again
maybe
something
tart
in
fruit
like
cranberries
or
something
more
red
wine
tannins
in
the
finish
and
a
puckery
sour
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
superbly
dirnkable
bottle
medium
body
in
the
end
and
bold
carbonation
just
short
of
pop
like
its
expensive
and
rare
but
it
is
just
a
beer
that
you
need
to
seek
out
its
hard
to
describe
because
it
stands
alone
a
sour
yes
but
its
so
much
more
than
that
one
of
the
more
complex
bottles
of
beer
around
awesome
awesome
awesome
i
love
this
beer
a
huge
fan
of
wild
ales
and
this
is
a
wild
ale
that
got
dressed
up
and
headed
out
to
a
formal
affair
deschutes
caudled
this
beer
and
it
shows
cant
wait
to
see
how
this
develops
with
age
i
have
a
2010
yet
to
be
cracked
and
will
be
laying
a
few
of
the
2012
down
to
try
annually
o
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
although
not
my
favorite
flanders
ale
i
had
several
bottles
of
collage
this
year
and
now
i
can
see
that
dissident
is
the
most
dominant
smell
and
taste
in
that
beer
i
have
another
bottle
to
age
i
will
revisit
after
a
year
or
so
o
i
feel
like
the
2008
is
a
vintage
not
to
be
matched
ever
again
hoping
the
yeast
eats
some
of
the
sugars
and
gives
this
more
depth
and
a
big
warning
about
drinking
this
less
than
cool
cost
12
99
o
very
tasty
and
intresting
beer
that
was
very
elusive
for
me
but
very
happy
to
finally
try
i
definitely
would
love
to
try
the
2010
version
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
so
glad
it
wasnt
a
big
sour
beer
like
i
was
expecting
this
is
actually
quite
drinkable
especially
given
the
abv
a
winelike
brew
a
nice
change
from
what
i
usually
drink
and
a
solid
overall
beer
o
really
enjoyable
beer
now
beautifully
aged
still
a
bit
bitter
and
rooty
with
nice
cherry
tartness
and
spicing
glad
to
have
more
of
these
in
the
cellar
will
try
not
to
wait
too
much
longer
before
having
another
overall
starts
out
challenging
but
ends
up
very
pleasing
worth
taking
the
trouble
to
seek
out
though
i
got
it
more
from
kevsals
generosity
than
any
effort
on
my
part
fantastic
the
benchmark
of
the
style
for
me
could
not
get
enough
of
this
dissident
2010
vintage
labeled
best
after
110111
reddish
brown
very
transparent
pretty
bad
head
retention
but
the
beer
glows
big
huge
cherry
in
the
nose
light
light
funk
with
some
faint
lactic
sour
hints
no
acetic
acid
little
bit
of
sweet
and
sour
candy
and
a
hint
of
oak
a
fantastic
smelling
ale
big
sour
cherry
flavor
hits
you
over
the
head
kinda
of
a
rough
biting
sourness
faintly
reminding
me
of
cough
syrup
on
the
finish
very
low
in
the
funk
department
really
no
vinegary
sourness
to
speak
of
it
is
more
of
a
lactic
natural
fruity
sourness
a
bit
of
a
bitter
quality
that
is
off
putting
but
show
cases
a
nice
oud
bruin
charecter
surprisingly
not
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
but
it
is
dry
and
vinous
which
is
nice
altogether
while
this
is
not
my
favorite
take
on
the
style
it
is
a
good
interpretation
i
get
it
i
just
dont
know
if
im
a
huge
fan
i
repeat
though
i
feel
deschutes
carried
through
on
this
well
overall
if
the
first
bottle
release
is
better
than
the
second
i
dont
think
my
brain
could
handle
it
so
much
flavor
and
just
enough
sour
and
funk
to
keep
things
exciting
loads
of
flavor
and
a
great
balance
seriously
deschutes
stop
being
so
good
at
things
it
makes
me
sad
that
i
cant
get
it
deschutes
has
an
immaculate
track
record
with
me
and
this
is
no
exception
the
dissident
is
nicely
sour
and
nicely
balanced
i
really
dont
understand
how
it
was
10
50
it
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
but
its
still
great
nice
label
art
too
overall
this
is
waaaay
better
than
the
2010
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
here
im
sad
to
say
this
is
my
last
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
stained
cherry
wood
red
in
color
with
a
soapy
off
white
lacing
around
the
glass
the
nose
consists
of
band
aids
and
cranberries
despite
the
adjectives
its
not
over
the
top
or
off
putting
the
flavors
consist
of
dry
bretty
band
aids
with
an
array
of
pomegranate
and
cranberry
pretty
interesting
the
brett
is
strong
in
this
one
it
goes
in
between
fruit
and
yeasty
dryness
i
dont
think
ive
had
this
style
this
big
and
this
dry
before
its
an
interesting
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
consider
this
a
sipper
for
the
style
it
makes
me
wonder
what
the
more
recent
batches
are
like
pours
a
copper
red
with
a
minimal
head
aroma
is
beast
typical
flanders
with
a
strong
sour
cherry
note
taste
isnt
as
good
medicinal
notes
overpower
flanders
taste
and
sour
cherries
fade
to
the
finish
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
this
is
not
as
good
as
i
expected
off
tastes
effect
the
mouthfeel
almost
puts
the
brakes
on
my
tastebuds
ill
take
a
red
poppy
any
day
over
this
i
had
real
high
expectations
for
this
beer
i
love
deschutes
and
i
love
sours
this
had
to
be
good
my
expectations
were
probably
unrealistic
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
next
dissident
release
early
2013
im
hearing
i
will
say
that
rrs
consecration
has
spoiled
me
o
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
not
overly
sour
but
with
the
right
balance
of
sour
and
fruit
wish
i
had
another
one
of
these
to
drink
thanks
scott
for
this
way
back
when
love
the
cabernet
and
pinot
wine
flavors
with
very
nice
oak
presence
d
a
decent
flanders
though
i
think
it
still
possibly
needs
more
time
to
develop
better
the
medicinal
note
became
more
and
more
prevalent
as
it
warmed
o
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
amazing
ive
had
plenty
of
sours
that
bring
a
lot
more
to
the
table
than
this
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
though
if
i
wasnt
used
to
drinking
russian
river
and
cascade
sours
on
a
semiregular
basis
id
probably
rate
this
beer
much
higher
overall
this
is
a
really
good
sour
that
could
have
been
fantastic
but
there
was
a
mild
metallic
note
in
the
taste
the
alcohol
was
almost
nowhere
to
be
found
not
sure
if
i
would
hunt
down
another
one
given
the
rarity
o
really
an
enjoyable
tartsour
brown
taste
is
rich
orange
cherries
flowers
and
sugar
sprinkled
red
grapefruit
with
a
little
sherry
like
oxidation
so
very
balanced
simple
and
fantastic
glassware
tulip
overall
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
one
and
im
a
little
disappointed
its
good
and
different
to
be
sure
im
just
not
blown
away
still
as
always
i
feel
fortunate
to
have
a
chance
to
try
a
fine
beer
from
one
of
americas
best
breweries
oi
liked
this
more
than
i
expected
perhaps
it
is
not
a
traditional
flanders
sour
idgara
this
is
brewed
in
america
beer
is
better
here
belgium
can
have
their
classic
bicycle
races
but
i
am
all
for
improving
belgian
beer
styles
and
deschutes
has
gone
against
the
grain
in
a
way
that
harmonizes
with
my
soul
well
done
deschutes
very
well
done
o
nothing
pisses
me
off
more
than
putting
a
beer
up
on
a
pedestal
and
having
it
not
live
up
to
your
expectations
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
not
liked
a
sour
beer
or
a
beer
by
deschutes
tragic
ft
the
dissident
iso
better
sours
o
the
flanders
oud
bruin
is
quickly
becoming
my
favorite
style
and
this
is
ranked
up
there
here
on
ba
amongst
the
best
of
them
presently
6
in
its
style
class
here
on
ba
the
dissident
did
not
dissapoint
i
spelled
that
wrong
intentionally
o
not
a
great
beer
merely
okay
had
some
moderately
decent
tastes
but
there
was
some
unpleasantness
on
the
end
i
didnt
care
for
not
super
easy
to
drink
either
o
i
like
different
but
this
was
too
different
not
the
typical
oud
bruin
it
did
get
better
as
it
warmed
but
all
in
all
i
didnt
feel
crazy
about
this
i
appreciate
it
but
didnt
really
enjoy
it
o
good
beer
id
have
it
again
its
really
one
of
my
first
sours
so
im
likely
not
capturing
the
intricacies
of
the
beer
d
masks
the
abv
pretty
well
tasty
drink
well
i
did
it
i
sat
on
it
for
9
months
and
i
appreciate
the
flavor
profile
in
this
one
it
was
a
good
sour
but
wasnt
the
most
earth
shattering
but
i
am
glad
i
waited
on
this
one
made
it
that
much
more
enjoyable
according
to
stormking47
who
told
me
an
08
is
much
better
quess
i
need
to
trade
for
one
damnit
overall
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
still
a
good
oud
bruin
but
not
anywhere
near
as
exciting
as
some
of
its
counterparts
deschutes
the
dissident
pours
an
opaque
mahogany
and
proper
backlighting
lightens
the
edges
to
more
of
a
redorange
the
two
pours
churned
up
one
and
two
fingers
of
very
light
tan
foam
serving
as
a
head
retention
is
minimal
and
lacing
nonexistent
but
i
guess
thats
somewhat
to
be
expected
the
nose
is
heavy
on
cherry
and
dark
fruits
from
the
wine
barrel
aging
theres
a
bit
of
funk
and
a
bit
of
tartness
but
the
aforementioned
cherryfruit
really
form
the
center
of
the
aroma
the
flavor
allows
the
supporting
notes
to
shine
through
a
bit
more
an
aciditytartness
leads
off
and
immediately
grabs
my
tastebuds
attention
the
cherry
and
red
wine
that
so
dominated
the
nose
slide
in
and
occupy
things
mid
palate
the
brett
flavors
finish
the
beer
off
and
its
nicely
nuanced
notes
of
leather
and
tobacco
are
a
great
way
to
close
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
yet
unspectacular
its
not
as
dry
as
i
would
have
expected
but
still
fairly
well
attenuated
the
carbonations
not
as
expansive
as
is
usually
found
in
some
other
belgian
styles
but
its
still
active
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
3
years
later
and
this
vintage
of
the
dissident
is
drinking
very
nicely
another
great
offering
from
the
brewery
thats
brought
me
the
abyss
and
mirror
mirror
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
experience
i
think
the
2008
still
has
a
way
to
go
so
there
is
no
need
to
open
it
any
time
soon
if
you
have
access
to
one
have
fun
i
opened
this
with
a
group
of
friends
some
of
whom
had
never
had
sour
beer
before
and
everyone
had
good
things
to
say
after
abyss
this
is
deschutes
best
bottled
brew
ive
had
not
my
favorite
within
the
style
a
sweet
flanders
oud
bruin
though
theres
also
an
unappealing
wet
cardboard
flavor
throughout
overall
just
an
excellent
beer
i
imagine
maybe
that
having
a
bottle
with
a
little
more
carbonation
might
work
some
good
here
but
im
quite
satisfied
indeed
with
my
dissident
growler
experience
o
im
thinking
this
has
some
potential
to
age
into
something
nice
but
i
think
it
will
take
35
years
to
do
so
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
exceptional
comes
to
mind
im
not
that
experienced
with
the
style
but
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
2010
ontap
at
beachwood
bbq
pours
a
very
murky
brown
with
a
golden
red
tint
the
head
is
about
a
finger
high
of
off
white
foam
with
exploding
pin
bubbles
pretty
attractive
brew
the
nose
is
instant
sour
tartness
up
front
with
cherry
banana
and
oak
aromas
following
the
taste
has
a
very
pleasant
slight
smokiness
to
it
and
is
dominated
but
tart

mainly
cherry
it
has
very
good
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
tart
tingle
and
some
heat
from
the
alcohol
been
searching
this
out
for
awhile
and
im
glad
i
got
some
d
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
and
hopefully
i
can
come
across
another
bottle
soon
a
very
nice
sour
easy
drinking
and
tart
yet
not
over
bearing
the
flavors
are
nothing
too
complex
but
still
interesting
and
enjoyable
had
this
at
a
tasting
at
jakes
5th
anneversary
nice
hazy
copper
color
capped
with
a
beige
head
that
quickly
fades
smells
of
sour
cherries
and
funk
still
after
these
few
years
tastes
of
cherries
up
front
followed
by
musty
horse
and
a
barely
perceptable
alcohol
burn
light
body
and
very
drinkable
2008

pours
a
clear

a
thick

sharp

pretty
balanced
and
enjoyable
and
bright

profile
opens
with
a
fair
amount
of
wine
barrel
and
sour
cherries
sweet
sour
much
darker
than
the
nose
not
as
bright
or
citric
acidity
on
the
back
end
really
wet
and
wine
barrelheavy
a
quality
that
i
dont
really
dig
in
sours
reminds
me
of
some
20092010
era
mckenzie
stuff
still
this
is
a
bit
more
refined
interesting
and
has
some
nice
aromatic
qualities
pretty
nice
i
still
wake
up
from
dreams
prominently
featuring
this
beer
and
cursing
myself
for
not
buying
more
onot
the
most
flavorful
or
most
sour
beer
out
there
however
the
flavors
mesh
well
and
their
nuanced
balance
is
wonderful
big
thanks
goes
out
to
my
boy
sincerenc
for
sharing
this
one
with
the
table
at
the
orf
11
release
2010
vintage
served
from
bottle
into
a
sampler
snifter
poured
bright
redorange
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
sour
tart
and
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
amlt
sour
funk
tart
and
dark
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
the
flavor
and
aroma
on
this
one
were
quite
good
despite
the
fact
that
neither
was
very
complex
with
that
it
must
be
known
that
i
am
a
big
sour
head
so
this
was
right
up
my
alley
i
think
this
one
could
have
benefited
from
a
small
amount
of
acetic
acid
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
but
that
is
about
it
definitely
worth
trying
or
trading
for
if
you
havent
had
it
already
2010
vintage
couldnt
pass
this
up
when
i
saw
it
on
the
bottle
list
at
toronados
24th
anniversary
party
pours
a
dark
reddishbrown
color
with
a
medium
offwhite
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
just
how
i
like
my
flandersstyle
beers
nice
tart
cherry
aromas
with
oak
and
vanilla
there
are
also
some
lovely
brett
aromas
smells
like
supplication
lets
see
if
it
tastes
as
good
as
the
rr
classic
interesting
quite
different
there
are
definitely
aspects
that
are
much
like
supplication
the
cherry
and
oak
flavors
are
spoton
tons
of
oak
which
i
love
this
beer
is
sweeter
than
i
was
expecting
though
it
is
much
sweeter
than
supplication
quite
a
bit
boozier
too
that
can
be
expected
at
being
over
10abv
though
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
tart
finish
drinkability
is
high
as
long
as
the
booze
doesnt
become
overwhelming
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
and
i
would
definitely
purchase
it
again
its
a
bit
more
sweet
and
boozy
than
i
would
like
it
to
be
though
more
time
would
definitely
do
this
beer
some
good
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
this
amongst
the
star
sour
beers
i
have
had
recently
and
just
the
good
beers
i
have
had
from
deschutes
overall
this
is
not
a
winner
for
me
especially
with
so
many
rock
stars
in
this
stylecategory
these
days
apparently
there
have
been
some
quality
and
varying
bottle
issues
with
this
batch
so
i
will
refrain
from
totally
discounting
this
beer
in
the
future
o
time
to
get
some
november
2010
releases
not
the
best
flanders
i
have
had
but
it
is
definitely
good
cheers
d
alright
if
were
going
by
style
here
then
it
gets
low
marks
dissident
is
a
hybrid
style
thats
difficult
to
grade
as
there
isnt
too
many
imperial
versions
of
the
style
out
there
its
a
oneanddone
beer
for
me
unique
and
delicious
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
proper
oud
bruin
this
isnt
it
o
a
great
sour
nice
balance
o
im
not
sure
whats
going
on
here
6
months
ago
on
release
it
was
drinking
really
nicely
now
its
practically
flat
and
sweeter
and
less
bretty
i
bought
one
bottle
of
this
vintage
separately
from
the
others
a
couple
weeks
after
the
release
i
wonder
if
perhaps
this
is
that
bottle
and
it
was
mishandled
overall
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
crisp
the
tastebuds
beg
for
more
no
hint
of
any
alcohol
my
fav
sour
hooked
me
up
with
the
bottle
thanks
man
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
orange
color
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
random
spots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sour
cherries
wine
grapes
wood
and
funkmustvinegar
taste
is
of
bitter
sour
cherries
sour
grapes
wood
from
the
barrels
and
funkmustvinegar
this
beer
has
a
good
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
slightly
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
flanders
oud
bruin
with
some
nice
sour
cherry
flavors
i
am
glad
i
got
to
acquire
2
bottles
of
this
i
am
going
to
hold
onto
the
other
bottle
for
a
while
to
see
how
it
ages
4
5
d
really
tasty
and
certainly
good
with
some
age
on
it
i
went
back
for
another
glass
o
quite
delicious
and
complex
brew
very
well
crafted
beer
with
a
myriad
of
flavors
that
are
all
well
represented
o
was
excited
to
try
this
one
on
tap
at
the
happy
gnome
for
mn
craft
beer
week
very
good
complex
delicious
very
nice
funky
sour
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
sipper
for
me
alcohol
was
present
but
did
not
take
away
from
the
experience
solid
offering
from
deschutes
as
far
as
sours
go
this
probably
is
one
of
the
easiest
to
stomach
for
the
masses
all
and
all
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
cheese
or
berries
a
little
bit
heavy
of
body
for
the
style
but
nice
carbonation
a
very
approachable
sour
finish
tart
and
long
full
of
an
array
of
flavors
and
craftmanship
the
alcohol
is
so
well
masked
in
this
beer
that
you
can
barely
notice
it
on
the
finish
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
of
brewing
by
the
folks
at
deschutes
well
done
after
missing
this
one
in
bottles
didnt
have
the
right
connections
at
the
time
i
finally
got
to
try
it
on
tap
poured
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
moderately
full
light
brown
head
very
funky
sour
and
tart
with
aromas
of
juicy
cherries
and
brett
on
the
palate
light
bodied
with
flavors
of
tart
cherries
red
wine
brett
and
a
little
caramel
very
tart
and
acidic
it
poured
a
hazy
golden
dark
orange
color
with
little
to
no
head
looked
like
a
darker
flanders
oude
bruin
it
smelled
like
it
was
going
to
taste
extremely
sour
you
could
smell
the
bacteria
that
was
used
to
sour
the
brew
once
i
tasted
it
i
was
completely
dissappointed
it
tasted
bitter
and
undrinkable
did
i
have
an
infected
bottle
ive
opened
3
and
theyve
all
tasted
the
same
mouthfeel
was
mediocre
effervescent
but
not
bubbly
enough
overall
i
didnt
enjoy
this
brew
at
all
beer
was
an
amazing
experience
that
was
subtle
sour
cherries
hints
of
other
berries
and
then
some
funk
a
very
light
beer
that
reminded
me
almost
of
sour
apple
juice
gooddamn
straight
it
was
i
would
buy
a
few
bottles
to
maybe
drink
after
the
date
suggested
on
the
bottle
sadly
we
dont
get
this
beer
in
florida
and
it
is
a
pretty
hard
bottle
to
come
by
otherwise
regardless
this
was
a
class
act
beer
great
entry
level
sour
ah
i
think
this
2010
vintage
is
still
slightly
hot
it
was
worth
buying
but
not
a
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
appreciated
the
cherries
and
complexity
of
the
flavors
wouldve
liked
either
a
greater
malt
or
brett
presence
either
wouldve
taken
this
offering
to
new
heights
overall
one
of
the
most
unique
tasting
brews
i
have
had
in
awhile
unique
and
different
but
not
really
my
thing
would
have
liked
some
sour
to
go
with
my
funk
but
that
never
happened
not
a
big
fan
and
will
not
be
seeking
any
more
of
this
brew
out
overall
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
big
time
ive
got
a
mirror
mirror
jubel
and
abyss
in
the
cellar
but
this
had
to
come
first
for
my
introduction
to
deschutes
this
beer
missed
the
mark
just
a
bit
with
my
expectationspreference
but
overall
is
a
solid
offering
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
in
trade
but
would
gladly
share
a
bottle
with
someone
in
the
future
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
go
and
look
forward
to
the
next
release
looks
like
an
every
two
year
deal
being
that
the
reviews
for
the
last
release
were
a
bit
more
positive
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
next
one
will
be
fun
to
try
as
well
serving
type
bottle
o
overall
a
truly
nice
beer
im
going
to
have
to
hold
onto
my
last
2010
for
a
few
years
to
see
how
this
one
hadles
a
bit
of
age
what
really
stands
out
with
the
dissident
is
the
smooth
but
yet
dry
mouthfeel
my
first
review
of
this
style
love
it
o
this
is
kind
of
like
cherries
and
blue
cheese
mix
pretty
good
highly
recommended
o
overall
deschutes
rules
another
fine
fine
beer
from
the
masters
the
nose
kills
it
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
tart
and
took
some
time
to
get
adjusted
to
very
enjoyable
beer
this
is
a
medium
bodied
offering
with
modest
carbonation
quite
bold
with
the
abv
not
really
hidden
much
however
it
is
easy
drinking
it
has
quite
a
clingy
wild
character
that
lasts
inside
the
mouth
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
a
little
young
tasting
enjoyable
all
around
its
my
fault
for
opening
this
prior
to
the
best
after
date
im
anxious
to
see
how
this
one
developes
and
enjoy
again
in
a
few
months
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
good
but
not
amazing
there
is
a
bit
too
much
hops
bitterness
and
body
not
enough
sour
for
my
taste
i
know
the
high
abv
makes
it
hard
for
bugs
to
sour
this
beer
but
lower
abv
and
more
sourness
would
have
been
a
plus
to
me
on
draft
at
beer
revolution
2010
batch
pours
a
reddish
amber
with
a
ring
of
white
head
around
the
outside
of
the
glass
leaves
some
small
spots
of
lacing
when
swirled
the
aroma
is
very
oaky
with
strong
cherries
a
decent
amount
of
vinegar
comes
through
as
well
as
a
little
bit
of
red
wine
a
little
bit
of
mineralness
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
i
dont
really
get
any
of
the
funk
usually
associated
with
brett
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
with
some
lactic
acid
which
goes
into
strong
oak
and
cherries
as
well
as
some
tannic
red
wine
the
finish
is
very
acetic
not
much
alcohol
in
the
taste
light
bodied
mediumlow
carbonation
pretty
astringent
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
is
really
dominated
by
oak
and
vinegar
this
is
excellent
pretty
much
like
everything
else
fro
this
brewery
fresh
this
is
not
over
the
top
sour
which
i
like
lots
of
nuance
and
something
i
would
highly
recommend
nice
flemish
sour
but
id
rather
have
red
poppy
or
several
belgians
any
day
drier
and
more
developed
than
i
remember
more
complex
definitely
recomend
a
few
years
of
age
it
is
a
nice
sipper
something
that
goes
down
pretty
easily
its
just
the
right
amount
of
sour
and
challenges
the
palate
i
was
hoping
for
something
mind
blowing
and
was
a
bit
let
down
i
would
trade
this
for
last
years
black
butte
xxii
d
very
drinkable
its
hard
to
believe
this
is
a
10
5
pours
a
crisp
orangish
red
with
a
bit
of
nice
head
no
real
lacing
but
a
beautiful
rim
of
head
left
smells
strongly
of
oak
and
cherry
subtle
vanilla
and
tart
sourness
tastes
sweet
and
tart
lots
of
oak
on
the
tongue
so
much
oak
the
cherry
is
pretty
strong
but
there
is
a
nice
vanilla
and
sour
kick
solid
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
for
such
a
sour
beer
really
impressive
d
drinkability
is
moderate
not
a
bad
beer
and
the
flavors
are
good
and
the
alcohol
is
absurdly
masked
but
the
acidity
is
just
a
bit
too
much
d
not
bad
for
a
sour
ive
had
some
4oz
samples
i
couldnt
even
finish
not
completely
into
sours
yet
very
nice
beer
d
well
i
know
deschutes
has
a
best
after
date
so
i
guess
i
cant
be
too
surprised
luckily
i
have
a
bottle
in
the
cellar
i
will
adjust
my
score
once
i
sample
that
one
in
a
year
would
love
to
try
this
again
had
a
bit
of
a
stomach
virus
when
i
had
this
and
it
took
away
from
the
overall
enjoyment
i
suspect
a
little
pricey
i
was
lucky
enough
to
grab
4
of
these
this
year
and
cant
wait
to
see
how
they
develop
through
the
years
drinkability
while
i
did
open
this
beer
before
its
enjoy
after
date
i
felt
the
need
to
try
it
now
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
noticeable
granted
it
is
10
5
in
addition
it
is
not
as
tartacidic
as
i
was
hoping
i
really
feel
some
age
on
this
will
really
let
the
alcohol
mellow
and
the
brett
pick
up
a
bit
more
cant
wait
to
try
this
in
about
a
year
or
so
have
four
more
left
may
trade
a
couple
but
i
will
keep
at
least
two
to
see
how
this
ages
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
and
get
my
hands
on
it

dits
not
a
bad
drinker
but
i
just
had
a
small
glass
of
this
and
im
not
sure
i
couldve
finished
an
entire
bottle
drinkability
is
not
the
highest
due
to
the
high
abv
great
sour
though
d
extremely
drinkable
for
a
sour
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
more
than
a
bottle
if
you
plan
on
using
your
taste
buds
for
something
afterwards
the
beer
is
smooth
with
a
light
finish
not
a
heavy
mouth
feel
at
all
but
the
sourness
definitely
helps
you
enjoy
this
one
a
bit
slower
like
you
would
with
a
tart
lemonade
very
impressive
d
i
dont
really
know
what
i
was
expecting
of
this
but
this
wasnt
it
the
abv
is
fairly
well
hidden
and
has
a
nice
balance
i
am
going
to
lay
one
down
and
see
how
it
fairs
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
for
it
being
as
young
as
it
is
and
coming
from
a
brewery
that
does
not
specialize
in
sours
the
beer
actually
reminds
me
a
lot
of
russian
rivers
sanctification
their
brett
only
beer
which
is
why
at
this
young
age
it
doesnt
get
a
better
score
from
me
pure
brett
especially
this
young
is
kind
of
harsh
it
lacks
the
nuance
ive
experienced
with
rrs
sours
that
make
use
of
all
three
strands
of
sour
yeasts
a
bit
of
lactic
acid
would
tame
the
tartness
add
a
creamy
mouthfeel
still
im
eager
to
try
this
again
in
a
year
or
two
drinkability
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
among
the
riot
of
flavor
had
an
average
palate
feel
will
rerate
if
get
a
chance
to
taste
an
aged
bottle
highly
refreshing
and
drinkable
even
though
im
drinking
it
at
room
temperature
this
is
some
really
interesting
stuff
medium
bodied
with
slightly
funky
tartness
puckering
but
not
too
much
so
with
no
acidity
its
more
sweet
really
with
lots
of
vinous
dark
fruit
hints
of
grape
dark
cherry
raisin
and
plum
well
balanced
with
earthy
oak
and
a
prominent
vanilla
character
complex
well
balanced
and
very
quaffable
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
an
08
vintage
and
it
is
mind
blowing
this
was
a
shell
of
what
it
can
be
a
good
beer
but
definitely
let
it
age
not
as
intense
as
i
expected
or
as
some
may
have
hoped
but
its
a
very
drinkable
10
5
sour
ale
one
worth
having
now
and
saving
away
for
years
to
come
pours
slightly
hazy
amber
with
very
thin
head
barnyard
on
the
nose
maybe
a
resemblance
to
some
funky
cheese
big
sweet
and
sour
on
the
palate
with
cherry
qualities
but
also
wild
with
all
those
yeast
influences
long
sour
finish
again
more
cherry
because
it
strikes
a
balance
between
the
overtlysour
and
the
atypicallysweet
it
is
easily
drinkable
and
suitable
for
either
a
warm
summers
day
or
a
frigid
winters
night
a
very
solid
sour
especially
for
the
price
though
for
the
moment
lacking
a
bit
in
complexity
i
expect
great
things
from
the
dissident
with
a
couple
of
years
on
it
im
happy
with
the
bomber
cant
say
id
drink
2
of
these
one
right
behind
the
other
but
its
certainly
not
a
chore
to
drink
alcohol
heat
is
nonexistant
edit
11911
just
tried
this
on
tap
and
it
was
a
bit
more
sour
than
the
bottle
but
i
still
found
this
years
version
to
not
be
up
to
level
established
by
the
first
release
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
lot
sad
that
i
dont
have
much
left
but
looking
forward
to
trying
it
again
in
a
year
medium
bodied
creamy
medium
carbonation
and
finishes
dry
the
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
this
is
a
wonderful
and
complex
beer
i
am
glad
i
have
one
more
bottle
to
age
i
recommend
this
beer
highly
overall
its
a
solid
fruity
sour
id
prefer
a
little
more
sour
or
brett
and
less
of
the
weird
aftertaste
d
i
would
love
this
brew
i
cannot
wait
to
open
a
bottle
next
year
i
can
see
why
people
like
this
beer
i
didnt
like
it
when
it
first
came
out
and
this
version
isnt
much
better
drinkability
i
havent
had
the
2008
version
of
the
dissident
so
i
can
only
rate
this
against
other
oud
bruins
outstanding
i
personally
enjoyed
the
depth
yet
mellow
contribution
the
brett
provided
this
presentation
the
cherry
provide
a
surprising
balance
with
its
sweet
contribution
an
outstanding
beer
ill
be
seeking
this
again
for
future
experimentation
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
it
drinks
pretty
smoothly
overall
and
the
tartness
hides
the
alcohol
id
absolutely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
looking
to
get
into
sours
or
even
to
anyone
that
doesnt
like
them
much
the
sweetness
of
the
cherries
really
offsets
the
sour
d
more
of
a
sipper
and
you
definitely
gotta
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
a
10
ounce
pour
was
enough
for
me
d
less
drinkable
than
i
remember
though
still
very
good
i
definitely
recommend
the
dissident
especially
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
sample
the
first
release
im
a
newbie
to
the
world
of
sour
beer
and
i
loved
the
dissident
i
wish
i
picked
up
an
extra
bottle
to
cellar
when
i
had
the
chance
i
wonder
how
this
will
taste
after
aging
for
a
year
or
two
hopefully
we
wont
have
to
wait
two
years
for
the
next
release
of
the
dissident
but
if
we
do
im
sure
it
will
be
worth
the
wait
conclusion
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
complex
interesting
and
subtle
i
love
it
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
other
5
bottles
that
are
waiting
in
my
cellar
if
this
gets
more
sour
and
funky
as
it
ages
i
think
it
will
only
get
better
this
beer
is
outstanding
and
is
surely
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
tasted
and
the
best
part
is
that
it
is
still
young
i
look
forward
to
tasting
another
next
year
with
anticipation
if
i
had
only
three
beers
to
drink
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
would
be
one
of
them
d
i
like
this
one
a
lot
it
is
almost
exactly
what
i
expected
from
it
however
so
it
didnt
blow
me
away
im
extremely
happy
i
got
to
try
it
and
really
wish
it
i
was
able
to
find
another
bottle
to
sit
down
with
for
a
little
while
but
maybe
next
time
a
wonderful
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
very
pleasing
on
a
standalone
basis
this
would
probably
make
a
good
counterpoint
to
an
overly
sweet
dessert
if
you
dig
tart
belgianstyle
beers
this
is
a
good
choice
overall
i
used
to
think
this
had
too
much
cherry
after
more
experience
with
sours
and
cherry
flavors
i
can
emphatically
state
that
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
not
the
epitome
of
the
style
but
the
barrel
aging
is
great
d
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
flanders
some
people
thought
the
first
batch
was
more
sour
and
had
mroe
oak
ive
never
had
that
batch
but
still
really
enjoyed
this
one
would
like
to
get
a
bottle
of
this
to
compare
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
light
carbonation
and
sweeter
taste
blending
with
the
tart
bite
makes
this
a
beer
that
could
easily
cause
you
to
enjoy
a
little
too
much
at
9
00
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
sweeter
than
i
expected
the
lead
off
character
is
strongly
malty
and
pretty
sweet
this
immediately
gives
way
to
a
strong
funky
sourness
mostly
lactic
with
an
acetic
and
mildly
citric
brightness
to
it
the
finish
is
clean
and
mildly
tart
in
the
corners
of
my
mouth
a
very
good
bruin
i
dont
get
the
hype
hugely
underwhelming
i
will
not
part
with
anything
that
i
cant
get
off
the
shelves
for
this
beer
i
also
sampled
a
few
other
deschutes
creations
while
at
pracna
obsidian
jubelale
i
must
say
this
is
definitely
the
most
original
beer
i
ever
tasted
and
the
most
standout
i
tasted
that
night
i
will
be
back
next
week
to
sample
it
yet
again
and
the
abyss
they
are
tapping
thursday
121610
the
dissident
is
crazy
drinkable
if
i
have
any
criticism
its
that
the
tartness
doesnt
seem
as
if
its
fully
come
into
its
own
yet
while
the
beers
great
now
i
think
a
year
or
two
in
the
cellar
could
make
it
outrageous
the
dissident
is
simply
spectacular
balanced
but
assertive
the
alcohol
heat
is
remarkably
wellhidden
behind
a
wall
of
flavors
the
sour
wild
nature
is
readily
apparent
but
the
massive
flavors
from
the
malt
and
cherries
rounded
out
by
barrel
aging
come
together
so
nicely
this
is
presumably
from
the
brandnew
november
2010
release
so
this
keg
was
less
than
a
month
old
and
snappier
than
hell
if
you
find
a
bottle
buy
it
if
you
see
it
on
draft
order
two
sillydrinkable
for
this
style
and
silky
smooth
all
around
the
beer
came
out
more
amber
than
brown
and
looked
a
bit
like
a
double
ipa
though
it
certainly
didnt
taste
like
one
theres
a
lightly
fruity
tart
bite
like
youd
expect
from
a
wild
ale
and
really
this
reminds
me
of
an
american
wild
ale
like
the
odells
woodcut
series
you
can
taste
a
little
of
the
cherries
and
theyre
matched
with
a
lemon
peel
bite
the
sour
character
is
relatively
clean
considering
how
earthy
and
funky
some
belgian
get
still
its
a
tasty
beer
and
id
expect
it
to
develop
nicely
over
time
even
at
9
its
relatively
drinkable
for
the
strength
and
i
wouldnt
have
minded
a
few
more
glasses
d
quite
nice
very
enjoyable
funk
is
prominant
and
welcome
a
bit
of
malt
presence
could
savor
this
one
for
a
long
time
but
it
is
going
down
a
bit
too
quick
excellent
hoping
to
be
able
to
try
a
bottle
from
the
new
release
to
compare
overall
this
is
a
great
drinkable
sour
ale
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
a
sour
ale
for
someone
who
has
not
had
a
sour
ale
before
because
it
is
well
balanced
but
true
to
the
sour
style
medium
bodied
beer
with
just
a
gentle
carbonation
slippery
and
slightly
syrupy
fairly
drinkable
glass
of
beer
as
the
sour
is
not
too
strong
not
lingering
too
long
on
the
tongue
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
but
better
to
sip
slowly
draft
sampled
on
121010
at
pracna
on
main
had
2
glass
the
first
poured
into
a
tall
pils
glass
a
clear
copper
amber
color
with
very
little
head
the
second
pour
was
into
a
snifter
and
did
have
a
slight
tan
head
aroma
is
that
of
sour
cherries
and
slight
acidic
notes
very
minimal
aroma
with
some
sweetness
mediumlight
mouthfeel
with
slight
carbonation
slightly
boozy
cherry
taste
with
white
wine
characteristics
woody
the
brett
is
pretty
subdued
may
be
interesting
how
time
treats
this
easy
drinking
but
with
all
the
craziness
over
this
in
mn
im
really
note
sure
if
it
deserves
the
hype
this
is
one
of
the
best
sour
beers
ive
ever
had
right
up
there
with
russian
river
consecration
so
good
that
i
went
back
to
bevmo
later
that
night
to
buy
more
d
its
amazing
how
a
beer
with
so
many
winelike
qualities
can
be
this
enjoyable
since
ive
never
been
a
big
wine
drinker
d
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
hype
but
its
real
real
good
anyway
drinkability
good
not
the
most
complex
of
sour
brews
but
really
delicious
and
very
drinkable
i
bought
several
bottles
to
age
but
was
lucky
enough
to
find
this
on
tap
at
the
parkway
in
tacoma
already
a
great
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
develops
the
way
i
see
it
there
are
two
possibilities
either
the
name
doesnt
fit
the
beer
assuming
this
is
what
the
brewer
was
going
for
or
the
beer
didnt
quiet
fit
the
brewers
vision
i
know
it
doesnt
sound
like
it
but
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
not
the
most
notable
release
from
deschuttes
but
certainly
not
the
worst
a
good
solid
brew
2010
version
split
with
the
wife
who
picked
it
up
for
me
at
10
99
at
local
beerstore
all
sold
out
in
a
day
wine
like
nose
golden
amber
color
with
minimal
head
softly
tart
with
oaky
wine
barrel
sour
cherries
and
a
bit
of
brett
funkiness
on
the
palate
similar
in
taste
to
the
deschutes
st
ryans
which
had
some
extra
brett
flavors
fruits
come
out
as
it
warms
up
cant
say
that
it
is
as
tart
as
the
previous
version
or
as
sour
to
me
so
while
muted
still
a
very
nice
cherry
flavored
finish
well
done
and
refreshing
even
the
wife
liked
it
so
that
is
saying
something
what
a
beer
i
loved
it
a
very
nice
sour
brown
a
bit
fruitier
and
more
sour
than
other
browns
ive
had
very
pretty
orange
copper
color
i
like
it
a
lot
tart
on
the
nose
but
also
prominently
acetic
as
well
nice
interplay
between
the
two
sour
notes
a
bit
of
cherries
some
oak
flavors
work
together
really
nicely
some
vinegar
tart
cherries
apples
light
brown
malts
they
all
come
together
well
while
still
showcasing
their
individual
lights
dry
finish
medium
to
full
body
for
a
sour
overall
a
great
drink
crisp
refreshing
sad
to
see
it
go
d
good
for
the
style
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
the
best
domestically
brewed
barrel
aged
sours
it
is
not
quite
as
fruity
as
the
flanders
beers
but
this
is
the
closest
thing
i
have
tasted
to
a
true
flanders
that
wasnt
the
nose
and
the
palate
are
loaded
with
red
and
dark
fruit
flavors
with
some
slight
spice
malts
that
blance
out
the
fruity
flavors
the
carbonation
is
just
perfect
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
and
really
fine
bubbles
that
are
almost
champagne
like
i
always
look
forward
to
the
release
of
this
beer
body
is
a
pretty
reddish
amber
color
toped
by
a
small
creamy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
mostly
tart
cherries
with
some
lactic
acid
astringency
and
sour
notes
palate
is
deliciously
complex
balanced
between
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
and
light
airy
malt
and
just
a
hint
of
sourness
up
front
the
lactic
sourness
builds
before
the
swallow
then
takes
over
completely
on
the
finish
lively
carbonation
keeps
the
cherries
dancing
around
the
acidity
this
has
aged
very
well
im
not
a
zealot
for
sour
beer
but
time
has
been
kind
to
this
one
and
its
a
pleasure
to
drink
yes
i
am
aging
it
rather
fresh
but
it
took
deschutes
some
time
to
finally
release
this
too
i
am
thinking
it
just
wasnt
ready
enough
then
and
its
still
not
ready
now
for
those
that
were
blessed
enough
to
have
other
vintages
i
am
guessing
this
one
will
fall
short
the
hype
machine
worked
its
magic
and
i
will
go
back
to
cascade
and
have
a
better
sour
again
drinkability
flavorful
but
seems
flat
not
too
sour
not
ready
for
prime
consumption
yet
eager
to
see
how
the
bottles
do
in
the
recommended
18
mos
of
aging
was
really
looking
forward
to
finally
trying
this
beer
while
it
was
still
pretty
good
i
was
a
little
let
down
by
the
somewhat
muted
flavor
and
lack
of
sour
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
i
am
not
a
sour
fan
so
i
might
not
be
the
best
judge
of
the
style
but
this
seems
like
a
moderately
sour
brew
not
intense
but
still
very
noticeably
sour
good
to
try
at
least
once
if
you
like
the
style
a
back
log
rating
from
a
tap
handle
this
poured
into
a
snifter
looking
foggy
reddish
with
an
off
white
head
that
created
a
ring
around
the
glass
throughout
the
whole
brew
aroma
of
winelike
characters
and
almost
lambic
in
nature
really
thick
palate
that
filled
and
expanded
nicely
in
the
mouth
this
brown
style
had
a
little
more
bitterness
and
darker
malt
notes
than
its
red
counterpart
and
it
seemed
the
wild
yeast
really
did
a
nice
job
you
could
taste
a
hint
of
barleygrains
in
the
finish
the
beer
manages
to
come
off
as
rich
in
my
mouth
but
the
carbonation
is
a
touch
heavy
still
its
medium
body
and
lack
of
any
perceivable
alcohol
make
it
a
winner
at
9
this
beer
has
brought
a
ton
of
vast
flavors
that
make
it
rich
and
delicate
while
the
prominent
sourness
wood
and
wild
edges
make
it
brash
and
bold
that
duality
makes
the
dissident
something
every
sour
beer
fan
should
try
an
epic
beer
for
the
sour
beer
lover
between
the
level
of
sourness
and
light
yeast
funk
this
beer
has
found
a
perfect
balance
way
too
drinkable
for
its
size
sip
and
savor
with
care
a
bottle
full
of
beer
geek
joy
d
probably
the
best
offering
from
deschute
ive
had
to
date
this
is
one
of
the
most
complex
and
balanced
flanders
that
ive
come
across
in
a
long
while
and
the
age
has
done
wonders
to
it
definitely
worth
seeking
out
and
truly
a
great
beer
even
though
i
had
the
foresight
to
buy
several
bottles
of
the
dissident
back
in
08
i
was
stupid
enough
to
trade
away
all
but
this
bottle
if
im
lucky
enough
to
have
access
to
the
second
release
scheduled
for
next
month
that
mistake
will
not
be
repeated
bottom
line
one
of
the
best
of
2010
drinkability
was
very
good
no
signs
of
abv
pours
a
golden
amber
with
tannish
head
good
lacing
smell
some
funk
malt

yeast
taste
sour
the

then
gone
followed
by

some

is
very
good
great
amount
of
carb
and
a
touch

dryness
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
drink
this
all
night
perfectly
balanced
imho
d
i
could
sip
this
one
all
day
long
of
course
i
would
be
slammed
after
405
glasses
no
notice
of
the
alcohol
until
the
glass
is
empty
super
balanced
and
easy
to
down
cant
wait
for
the
next
release
taste
is
of
raspberry
straberry
sweet
wine
and
a
good
amount
of
sour
some
funk
just
enough
to
balance
the
sweetness
very
well
rounded
one
of
the
few
high
abv
beers
i
would
describe
as
refreshing
overall
a
solid
american
shot
at
an
oud
bruin
i
liked
this
beer
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
by
a
stretch
d
this
is
drinking
very
well
right
now
i
would
love
to
score
another
bottle
of
this
and
just
let
it
set
another
year
or
so
have
a
feeling
some
of
the
cherry
flavor
died
down
reading
past
reviews
overall
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
the
way
it
is
now
note
ive
had
this
beer
younger
and
i
think
this
age
approximately
2
years
is
pretty
perfect
d
not
sure
if
sitting
for
over
a
year
has
helped
this
but
the
dissident
is
an
excellent
flanders
very
rich
spicy
and
fruity
with
a
layer
of
maltiness
that
keeps
things
very
interesting
d
not
my
favorite
flemish
sour
but
a
decent
representation
only
lightly
sour
but
a
decent
balance
of
sweetness
and
tartness
deschutes
reserve
series
continues
to
kick
so
much
ass
d
a
very
subtle
and
complex
oud
bruin
not
flashy
by
any
means
maybe
the
age
had
something
to
do
with
this
quite
drinkable
would
go
great
with
some
earthy
or
slightly
funky

at
and
abv

a

dangerous

really
impressed
with
how
much
it
is
changing
over
the
past
15
minutes
opening
up
and
growing
fantastic
beer
d
oh
quite
drinkable
someone
please
send
me
another
bottle

0
d
as
a
fairly
recent
n00b
to
sours
this
could
easily
be
a
gateway
beer
to
the
style
very
mild
yet
intriguing
with
every
sip
id
like
to
have
this
again
and
again
d
these
kinds
of
beers
are
definitely
hit
or
miss
with
me
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
enjoyable
all
of
the
components
worked
really
well
together
to
create
a
balanced
and
drinkable
brew
thanks
for
sharing
chris
d
a
great
wild
ale
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
brett
fruit
and
subtle
bitterness
w
the
malt
not
being
forgotten
and
making
the
experience
pleasurable
i
recently
had
a
bottle
of
this
which
i
found
at
a
store
this
past
january
2010
in
anchorage
ak
when
i
was
attending
the
gabbwf
i
was
quite
surprised
to
find
it
as
i
havent
seen
it
in
my
native
oregon
since
it
was
released
the
colour
was
a
rubyamber
with
no
head
the
aroma
was
both
funky
and
fruity
and
nicely
balanced
between
the
two
on
the
palate
it
was
quite
tart
dry
and
musty
with
plenty
of
stone
fruit
flavours
and
a
bit
of
horse
blanket
to
round
it
all
out
pretty
authentic
flanders
here
deschutes
has
done
a
great
job
as
usual
sourness
and
vinegar
aspect
of
the
beer
is
pretty
sharp
and
has
a
nice
bite
sour
cherry
and
cranberry
fruitiness
is
well
done
and
does
not
go
overboard
i
could
see
this
one
would
not
age
well
over
extended
periods
of
time
as
the
vinegar
aspect
of
the
beer
would
start
to
overwhelm
from
the
taste
of
it
seems
2
years
is
just
about
right
there
is
even
a
touch
of
hop
presence
giving
it
a
little
north
american
feel
the
rotting
wood
character
that
was
prevalent
in
the
nose
is
more
in
the
background
on
the
palate
the
abv
is
ridiculously
well
hidden
cant
even
taste
it
i
could
easily
drink
a
whole
bomber
to
myself
and
still
might
crave
some
more
excellent
beer
i
really
dig
it
goes
well
with
craisins
and
soft
chevre
goat
cheese
poured
into
a
harpoon
tulip
formed
a
1
12
beige
head
over
the
cloudy
reddish
copper
brew
head
continues
to
grow
for
awhile
before
slowly
starting
to
fade
with
chunky
lacing
aroma
is
bubblegum
and
tart
cherries
taste
starts
sweet
has
a
powerful
tartness
in
the
middle
and
a
lightly
smoky
clean
close
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
drinkability
is
good
also
very
impressed
with
how
the
sour
stays
in
the
middle
and
doesnt
dominate
the
entire
flavor
experience
d
very
easy
to
drink
despite
high
abv
the
sourness
is
assertive
but
not
overbearing
this
would
be
a
great
starter
beer
for
someone
whos
new
to
sourswilds
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
welldone
beer
drinkability
a
very
well
crafted
brew
complex
and
surprisingly
balanced
i
know
despite
not
having
too
many
examples
of
it
that
this
is
a
style
thats
hard
to
pull
off
and
so
i
have
to
give
kudos
to
deschutes
for
putting
together
a
great
brew
9
0
is
high
but
not
astronomically
so
and
though
this
one
came
at
the
end
of
the
evening
for
us
this
was
a
fairly
epic
tasting
it
was
still
drinkable
enough
that
i
neglected
to
leave
any
in
the
snifter
m
d
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
and
semidry
the
carbonation
takes
from
the
dryness
on
the
palate
and
it
could
help
to
be
a
little
dryer
in
that
sense
overall
a
wellbalanced
brew
sour
rich
and
intense
very
well
done
pours
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
vinegar
and
very
tart
cherries
definitely
a
very
good
aroma
the
flavor
is
also
heavy
on
the
cherries
with
some
funk
as
well
it
is
definitely
a
sour
beer
but
not
as
sour
as
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
it
would
be
you
also
get
some
oak
and
vanilla
in
the
flavor
medium
to
high
carbonation
and
very
drinkable
too
good
and
too
easy
to
drink
not
hint
at
all
of
the
9
abv
hands
down
the
best
cherry
flavor
i
have
ever
had
as
noted
above
this
beer
has
begun
to
lose
some
of
its
initial
cherry
flavor
and
has
balanced
out
nicely
really
looking
forward
to
the
next
batch
in
2010
slow
and
long
sippper
as
good
as
it
gets
note
i
preferred
the
2008
to
the
much
boozier
2010
which
was
a
bit
overwhelming
prickly
mediumhigh
carbonation
starts
sour
and
finishes
with
a
spicy
bite
great
drinkability
considering
its
abv
and
high
acidity
although
im
a
bit
biased
for
beers
of
this
style
i
liked
this
better
fresh
because
the
fruitiness
of
the
cherries
helped
to
balance
out
some
of
the
acidity
great
beer
so
glad
i
started
trying
sours
beers
overall
i
am
glad
i
saved
a
bottle
this
long
and
wish
i
had
another
i
really
did
not
enjoy
the
last
bottle
i
cracked
so
if
youve
been
holding
on
to
these
and
have
a
few
now
is
a
great
time
to
break
that
wax
this
is
not
very
drinkable
i
could
probably
drink
a
bottle
if
i
split
it
with
someone
but
this
would
be
the
last
time
id
drink
this
i
would
not
search
this
out
or
recommend
getting
it
unless
your
a
big
time
sour
fan
and
just
want
to
try
it
d
a
fairly
good
attempt
at
a
style
that
seems
hard
to
master
outside
of
the
boarders
of
belgium
its
slightly
too
heavy
and
big
to
be
really
good
the
additions
from
the
cherries
are
really
nice
though
d
awesome
nice
light
tartness
tanic
wine
qualites
with
a
touch
of
oak
and
sweetness
now
sure
how
this
one
was
when
it
was
released
but
it
is
drinking
world
class
right
now
drinkablity
very
drinkable
brew
that
creeps
up
with
its
potency
fits
the
style
well
but
has
something
indescribable
that
makes
it
unique
i
enjoyed
the
bitter
finish
it
takes
a
beer
like
this
to
remind
us
that
brewing
can
be
a
ritual
suffused
with
beauty
and
spirituality
i
suppose
anything
inoculated
with
wild
yeasts
infused
with
cherries
for
a
year
and
then
aged
in
pinot
and
cabernet
barrels
is
expected
to
be
unique
but
deschutes
not
only
pulled
off
the
traditional
belgian
style
extraordinarily
they
also
added
their
own
trademark
american
stamp
that
made
this
something
much
more
than
a
mere
replication
d
this
beer
is
damned
drinkable
the
flavors
are
very
tasty
and
refreshing
this
beer
cools
rather
than
warms
refreshes
and
tests
the
palate
i
suppose
it
could
be
more
dynamic
but
it
has
a
beautiful
subtlty
sadly
this
beer
has
gone
much
quicker
than
expected
and
remains
my
only
bottle
will
absolutely
have
to
track
down
some
more
bottles
of
this
fantastic
brew
pours
a
dark
ruby
with
a
large
white
head
the
smell
is
one
of
sweetness
with
a
little
bit
of
tart
fruit
coming
in
mostly
cherries
hints
of
wood
some
slightlyroasted
malt
and
accompanying
sweetness
the
taste
is
most
prominent
in
the
tart
fruit
department
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
seems
to
have
a
little
too
much
vinegar
to
it
it
is
good
and
represents
the
style
pretty
well
but
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
fresh
and
reevaluate
d
very
balanced
not
too
sour
not
too
funky
2008
bottle
thanks
to
paytoplay
pours
a
really
hazy
redbrown
with
a
small
light
tan
head
vinous
and
woody
with
some
light
spice
notes
in
the
background
smells
somewhat
tart
with
lactic
notes
and
quite
a
bit
of
mustiness
taste
is
a
bit
sour
again
with
lactic
notes
heavy
oak
with
a
lot
of
earthiness
definite
brett
notes
lots
of
cherry
and
fruit
very
intense
nice
full
body
really
impressive
effort
from
deschutes
i
wonder
where
this
beer
will
go
next
it
was
drinking
great
for
me
when
it
was
first
bottled
and
even
better
after
six
months
now
it
is
getting
more
funk
in
the
complexity
arena
it
is
a
bottle
i
would
recommend
sharing
but
i
am
enjoying
the
ride
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
strong
carbonation
dnot
something
i
would
go
for
again
i
think
i
still
need
to
get
worked
into
these
sour
beers
slower
not
sure
my
palate
is
ready
i
did
enjoy
this
more
than
others
i
have
tried
though
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
much
milder
than
other
sours
i
have
experienced
recently
the
oak
and
cherry
are
really
the
main
characters
for
this
brew
a
well
done
brew
by
deschutes
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
others
have
the
abyss
08
in
my
cellar
what
a
treat
to
find
a
flanders
brown
ale
i
was
shocked
when
i
heard
about
it
and
of
course
rushed
to
our
local
beer
shop
and
picked
it
up
the
aroma
was
full
of
complex
dark
fruits
and
malt
character
with
sour
notes
when
pouring
the
aromas
waft
up
out
of
the
billows
of
frothy
offwhite
head
the
color
is
a
pleasant
medium
brown
with
a
few
garnet
highlights
brilliant
clarity
and
the
head
persists
while
drinking
slight
lacing
i
was
impressed
with
the
balance
of
flavors
in
this
beer
it
begins
with
toasty
malt
character
and
deep
fruitiness
thatlayers
into
the
sour
semidry
finish
the
hops
are
really
not
noticeable
but
there
may
be
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
counter
point
the
sour
and
fruit
character
the
sourness
of
the
beer
is
prominent
but
balanced
with
the
other
components
of
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
slight
drying
and
the
sourness
has
that
tostyle
touch
of
astringency
overall
the
beer
is
very
wellbalanced
and
drinkable
once
your
palate
adjusts
for
the
sourness
a
beer
well
worth
the
purchase
particularly
for
such
a
hardtofind
style
drinkability
all
in
all
that
was
awesome
i
definitely
had
my
doubts
about
this
one
but
it
pulled
through
and
was
downright
delicious
toward
the
end
maybe
the
sourness
is
on
the
tame
side
im
not
sure
no
stinging
carbonation
which
is
something
thats
always
bugged
me
about
wild
ales
and
lambics
this
may
be
my
gateway
beer
into
sours
ill
be
buying
a
couple
bottles
next
time
i
see
this
d
drinkability
is
very
good
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
a
remarkable
beer
in
its
own
right
it
is
a
stronger
brew
but
the
abv
does
not
seem
to
hinder
how
easy
it
goes
down
one
bomber
in
a
session
is
enough
for
me
but
i
would
love
to
visit
this
brew
again
smooth
balanced
winning
beverage
in
my
book
the
aroma
was
pruney
tangy
the
taste
was
complex
with
what
appeared
to
be
strong
cherry
malt
the
tartness
was
perfect
and
the
alcohol
well
masked
i
did
however
find
a
less
than
wonderful
after
taste
that
really
effected
the
drinkability
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
really
lingered
way
too
long
this
beer
has
mellowed
out
a
bit
since
the
first
time
i
had
it
when
it
was
released
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
cellaring
and
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
develops
the
next
time
i
pop
one
the
dissident
is
very
good
beer
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
its
really
grown
on
me
with
each
passing
sip
i
really
like
its
subtle
and
deceptive
approach
the
flavor
is
somewhat
tame
for
a
sour
funky
flanders
oud
bruin
but
its
a
big
time
beer
that
will
creep
up
on
you
the
flavor
is
nicely
refined
and
enjoyable
its
rather
artful
if
that
makes
any
sense
overall
its
a
very
nice
success
and
proves
once
again
how
talented
the
fine
folks
at
deschutes
are
nice
job
guys
nice
and
solid
pleasant
and
refreshing
but
short
of
great
blipped
dissident
aggressor
by
judas
priest
the
color
is
an
brownish
red
with
a
very
light
head
the
lacing
that
this
beer
leaves
on
the
glass
is
just
amazing
it
smells
of
very
sweet
fruits
and
slight
sourness
the
taste
is
extremely
tart
raspberries
and
sour
apple
dissident
has
a
very
thin
light
body
which
makes
it
extremely
easy
to
drink
i
truly
enjoyed
this
gem
md
this
beer
is
exceptional
good
in
my
opinion
i
was
surprised
in
a
good
way
never
had
the
style
and
now
ill
seek
it
out
its
a
bit
sweet
but
good
d
the
funk
is
deliciously
intense
reddish
brown
color
very
small
head
smells
like
sour
fruit
with
a
bit
of
malt
im
not
really
sure
what
to
compare
this
too
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
slight
vinegar
taste
not
too
sour
just
enough
to
give
it
a
nice
twang
slightly
spicy
and
peppery
medium
carbonation
level
the
sourness
does
a
nice
job
of
scrubbing
the
palate
i
like
this
beer
i
havent
had
too
many
sours
before
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
too
but
i
like
it
d
big
thanks
to
stellar
johngalt1
for
this
gem
what
an
extraordinary
beauty
form
the
pnw
thanks
again
toby
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
ive
never
had
this
style
but
ive
enjoyed
it
overall
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
dark
mahogany
body
sits
regal
in
the
glass
hosts
a
bread
crust
colored
speckled
deep
tan
head
that
stands
at
an
inch
and
fades
in
a
minute
nose
is
very
attractive
with
tones
of
sweet
tart
cherries
doughy
yeast
and
dark
fruit
resins
keeps
with
that
yeasty
feel
as
you
take
first
sip
followed
by
an
initial
sweet
tart
tingle
on
the
tongue
the
tart
feel
turns
slightly
vinegary
but
still
nice
the
sour
feel
stays
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
creates
a
mouthfeel
of
sour
dry
bitter
almost
turns
to
a
citrus
bitter
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
drinkability
is
good
its
relatively
clean
for
a
funky
beer
properly
built
gorgeous
to
look
at
and
inhale
with
no
significant
flaws
but
its
in
need
of
refinement
that
said
considering
the
exploding
price
points
of
american
wild
ales
its
nice
to
see
a
brewer
not
start
ramping
up
to
the
1530
dollar
range
before
theyve
mastered
the
art
in
that
price
range
i
still
only
trust
russian
river
domestically
for
wild
ales
although
i
still
end
up
buying
others
heres
hoping
each
subsequent
release
pushes
this
beer
from
simply
good
to
the
realm
of
the
truly
great
2008
vintage
tasted
at
58f
pours
into
my
wine
tasting
glass
a
beautiful
red
copper
with
a
nice
foamy
head
mild
funky
sour
malt
aroma
delicate
body
is
appropriate
to
style
but
surprising
to
me
as
i
usually
prefer
more
extreme
bigbodied
beers
flavor
is
sour
malty
and
mildly
funky
all
three
harmoniously
merging
together
finishes
dry
but
no
hops
bitterness
flavor
or
aroma
are
detectable
there
is
a
slight
weird
smoky
or
chocolate
flavor
towards
the
end
overall
a
sipping
beer
with
the
complexity
and
interest
of
a
fine
wine
thanks
toby
poured
reddish
not
too
thick
an
aroma
of
spit
and
bacteria
initially
the
sourness
well
controlled
by
malt
decent
mouthfeel
for
a
sour
drinkable
over
a
meal
tastes
somewhat
of
a
wild
ale
that
builds
up
in
the
mouth
over
repeated
sips
intersting
and
worth
seeking
out
deschutes
this
far
my
first
flanders
oud
bruin
not
bad
but
not
great
especially
compared
to
lambics
and
flanders
reds
there
is
nice
flavor
up
front
but
not
much
on
the
back
end
maybe
thats
par
for
the
style
still
a
decent
beer
bottle
poured
a
deep
reddish
color
ale
with
large
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
great
lacing
aroma
of
oak
and
tart
notes
are
clearly
dominant
with
some
light
funk
also
discernable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
oak
notes
with
a
tart
taste
with
some
lactic
funky
sour
notes
also
noticeable
good
body
with
great
carbonation
with
no
apparent
alcohol
while
i
really
enjoyed
the
sourness
and
the
oak
notes
i
thought
the
funky
yeast
didnt
integrated
that
well
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
still
very
good
nonetheless
deschuttes
keepes
bringing
out
amazing
brews
keep
up
the
good
work
i
found
the
2010
edition
to
much
less
flavorful
and
more
watery
than
the
2008
edition
and
my
score
has
decreased
from
4
25
to
4
0
overall
the
oak
flavor
dominated
and
the
sour
acidic
profiles
did
not
match
the
strength
the
nose
led
on
to
believe
the
mellow
flavors
were
just
too
weak
and
easily
masked
by
the
wood
oak
flavors
dvery
cool
beer
the
sweet
and
sour
continue
ever
after
not
having
a
sip
for
a
few
minutes
very
long
lasting
and
memorable
delicious
simply
delicious
d
this
is
a
fantastic
sour
i
only
hold
consecration
higher
than
this
really
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
tasty
sour
and
balanced
not
as
good
as
red
poopy
but
still
a
damn
good
oud
bruin
d
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
creeps
up
from
behind
there
are
zero
hop
characteristics
in
this
beer
which
is
an
interesting
change
of
pace
if
you
dislike
lambics
youll
probably
dislike
this
one
a
very
good
and
surprising
beer
for
me
tartness
and
sweetness
towards
the
very
impacts
drinkability
to
the
minus
overall
this
is
the
first
flanders
style
beer
i
have
tried
the
beer
has
a
pleasant
sourness
to
the
beer
but
it
is
not
vinegary
the
mouth
feel
is
a
medium
body
with
some
sweetness
and
some
tartness
to
the
beer
the
finish
lingers
on
the
palate
and
is
surprisingly
refreshing
and
tasty
the
first
sip
of
the
beer
i
kinda
puckered
my
face
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
i
like
this
beer
it
is
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
a
great
take
on
the
style
and
i
am
interested
to
see
how
this
one
progresses
this
beer
pours
an
orangy
brown
with
a
1
fingered
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
is
huge
of
sour
the
taste
has
alot
of
sour
mixed
with
a
nice
borwn
ale
this
was
strange
due
to
tasting
the
russian
river
earlier
where
the
oak
flavor
was
nearly
nonexistant
but
this
one
you
have
a
big
brown
ale
flavor
must
be
tons
of
dark
malts
in
this
brew
a
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
good
carbonation
level
and
a
nicely
drinkable
brew
a
nice
take
on
the
style
very
drinkable
enjoyable
without
being
overpowering
unique
yet
instyle
overall
a
good
beer
that
just
misses
on
being
great
would
like
to
try
another
as
other
reviews
mention
a
good
sour
bite
so
possibly
mine
is
off
recommend
but
do
go
crazy
getting
it
43
53
543
5
not
at
the
top
of
my
list
but
i
would
try
it
again
nice
hustle
deschutes
drinkability
i
really
liked
this
brew
quite
a
bit
im
not
a
huge
style
guideline
dude
and
i
think
plenty
of
people
have
knocked
the
score
down
a
bit
but
i
love
whats
going
on
here
the
fruit
plays
a
nice
roll
and
adds
that
tart
fleshy
bitter
like
aspect
that
i
enjoy
tasty
ass
shit
here
thanks
again
matt
d
ah
oud
bruin
one
of
my
favorite
styles
that
ive
rarely
had
i
wish
more
american
breweries
would
try
their
hand
at
this
one
a
wonderful
brew
from
a
wonderful
brewery
i
love
deschutes
keep
em
coming
ill
keep
drinking
vinous
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
and
sticky
effect
on
the
palate
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
beer
its
not
overly
sour
or
funky
so
i
think
it
could
possibly
appeal
to
people
who
dont
like
sours
poured
a
dark
redcopper
color
with
small
white
head
that
vanished
almost
instantly
the
aroma
was
that
of
brett
sourfunk
with
cherry
and
fruity
smells
that
permeated
the
tartness
the
taste
was
exactly
that
of
the
aroma
with
a
lingering
harsh
fruit
flavor
typical
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
while
going
down
and
the
drinkability
was
easy
due
to
the
mediumfull
creamy
body
overall
enjoyed
this
beer
due
to
my
love
for
brett
and
fruity
funk
i
dont
know
that
i
could
or
would
want
to
drink
this
beer
every
night
but
it
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
experience
great
nose
and
complex
sour
taste
a
fantastic
beer
and
worth
checking
out
d
this
beer
is
damn
enjoyable
but
i
think
the
funk
could
have
been
pushed
down
some
and
it
would
have
been
more
more
enjoyable
drinkability
poured
into
my
gulden
draak
chalice
it
lets
itself
work
well
upon
the
overall
experience
very
tart
and
dry
apple
cider
notes
i
cant
express
enough
fine
resilient
notes
our

that
offer
up

d
this
is
a
great
beer
more
tart
than
the
leifmans
oud
bruin
but
right
on
par
with
the
oerbier

and
other
world
class

with
a
thin

nice

great
sour
fruit
aroma
not
quite
as
sour
as
the
aroma
might
suggest
but
the
yeasty

is
there
medium
bodied
with
a
spritzy
mouthfeel
sour
cherry
flavor
develops
as
well
as
a
little
wood
in
the

very
refreshing
and
drinkable
alcohol
is
not
evident
very
enjoyable
absolutely
disgusting
stuff
deschutes
should
be
ashamed
of
themselves
for
making
something
like
this
very
very
impressive

bottle
pours
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
an
average
offwhite
head
somewhat
lasting
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
mainly
funky
like
horse
blanket
and
farmhouse
with
notes
of
cherry
and
wood
taste
started
sour
and
funky
at
first
and
ended
on
a
sweeter
note
not
so
overly
sour
that
it
can
only
be
enjoyed
by
those
that
love
the
style
but
not
so
sweet
that
the
flavor
gets
wrecked
id
say
a
great
first
try
at
the
style
by
deschutes
i
freakin
hate
wax
capped
bottles
i
have
said
it
before
and
will
say
it
again
that
being
said
pours
a
very
nice
copperychestnut
color
decent
sized
head
great
cherryfruit
aroma
with
a
touch
of
woody
and
earthiness
to
it
flavor
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
sour
fruit
with
some
oak
or
general
wood
like
flavors
rather
tartsour
but
not
overly
so
retains
some
sweetness
thoughout
decent
mouthfeelslight
puckering
in
the
finish
great
beer
overall
fantastic
us
version
for
sure
decent
beer
to
cellar
i
would
think
thanks
to
jtrockchalk
for
the
secret
santa
sample
remarkable
beer
smells
of
sweet
and
tart
fruit
with
granny
smith
apples
cranberry
cherry
and
raspberries
the
taste
starts
very
tart
and
follows
with
flavors
of
cherries
cranberries
and
other
tart
fruits
the
mouthfeel
has
medium
body
and
has
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
drinkability
is
high
i
could
not
put
this
down
and
had
no
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
this
was
my
first
sour
beer
and
it
leaves
me
wanting
to
try
more
highly
recommended
to
those
who
want
to
try
something
different
this
is
absolutely
wonderful
should
be
sought
out
by
any
fan
of
belgian
sour
sales
belgian
wild
ales
belgian
ales
in
general
and
just
damn
great
beer
the
belgians
better
watch
their
backthe
dissident
is
a
badass
mutha
of
an
oud
bruin
there
are
actually
belgians
who
think
no
u
s
brewer
could
possibly
brew
a
belgianstyle
ale
with
any
integrity
i
wont
name
names
the
dissident
smashes
that
notion
once
and
for
all
d
not
overly
puckering
and
sour
but
nice
and
complex
great
representation
of
style
in
all
aspects
and
a
beer
that
i
hold
high
on
my
all
time
list
poured
into
a
cabernet
glass
appears
a
beautiful
amber
hue
with
a
creamy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
into
spotty
lacing
smells
of
oak
funk
and
fruit
the
cherries
really
show
through
on
this
beer
as
well
as
the
pinot
noir
from
the
barrels
18
months
did
this
beer
justice
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
dry
and
dissipates
rather
fast
coaxing
me
into
drinking
it
faster
very
drinkable
but
be
cautious
if
it
warms
up
to
much
the
funk
becomes
a
little
challenging
drinkability
is
good
restrained
sourness
and
funk
good
balance
hides
the
9
alcohol
fairly
well
good
stuff
big
thanks
to
djeucalyptus
for
this
baby
poured

a

nice
dark

with
a
thin

pour
mine
seemed
to
dissapate
quickly
smell
was
divine
lots
of
sour
apple
vinegar
and
dark
sour
fruit
taste
was
similar
got
the
sour
fruit
cherries
apple
etc
also
got
a
phenolic
medicinal
tone
interesting
good
full
mouthfeel
served
barely
chilled
this
one
was
good
not
great
i
had
no
idea
of
what
to
expect
with
this
style
so
i
cannot
speak
to
how
true
to
the
style
it
stays
but
pretty
tasty
no
less
i
enjoyed
this
beer
to
the
full
extent
and
recommend
that
if
you
havent
yet
tried
it
you
want
to
i
will
be
again
drinkability
is
quite
good
not
a
big
sour
beast
like
a
lot
of
the
sours
i
have
tried
this
one
is
thick
feeling
but
the
sourness
provides
a
nice
tart
back
drop
instead
of
being
in
your
face
very
nicely
done
deschutes
deep
tawny
amber
clear
with
a
bit
of
a
reddish
hue
it
had
a
sticky
beige
cap
that
left
some
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
a
bit
sharp
on
the
nose
mildly
acetic
but
quite
tart
overall
slightly
earthy
with
some
cinnamon
spiciness
and
light
horsey
funk
the
flavour
was
full
of
tart
fruit
and
berry
some
earthy
brett
and
dried
fruit
towards
the
end
oak
and
vanilla
plus
a
bit
of
molasses
appeared
as
it
warmed
medium
to
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
the
bubbles
were
quite
light
on
the
palate
though
giving
it
a
smooth
texture
nicely
balanced
quite
a
mellow
sour
at
least
after
the
other
monsters
we
imbibed

very
nice
stuff
need
to
have
it
again
though
it
was
in
some
tough
competition
that
night
thanks
russ
i
enjoyed
the
dissident
quite
a
bit
even
though
it
didnt
come
together
like
i
hoped
it
would
it
did
go
down
super
easy
and
id
like
more
of
it
now
that
my
glass
is
empty
i
dont
know
what
some
time
will
do
but
i
doubt
it
will
do
much
hopefully
things
get
a
little
better
here
drinkability
is
ok
here
but
it
is
so
hard
to
find
a
bottle
around
here
in
ky
pours
hazy
auburn
with
a
short
offwhite
head
i
agree
with
ernest
the
wax
cap
nearly
drove
me
insane
trying
to
carve
off
enough
to
open
the
bottle
aroma
is
malty
with
funky
cherries
and
earthy
wood
not
like
other
sours
smooth
and
warm
cherry
malt
oak
and
vanilla
when
the
sour
comes
it
is
mellow
mostly
brett
and
cherries
but
in
a
vinuoussherry
way
drinks
more
like
a
liquer
than
a
funky
sour
puckerbomb
excellent
beer
edit
just
noticed
the
alcohol
content
is
9
drinks
like
a
5
5
abv
beer
uh
oh
i
thought
it
was
8385164
0
well
see
so
does
approachable
equal
good
well
it
has
the
characteristics
of
a
sour
ale
and
yet
remains
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
even
on
this
a
wicked
bitterly
cold
night
so
yeah
id
have
to
say
that
it
does
equal
good
beautiful
on
the
whole
and
an
amazing
brew
considering
the
relatively
mainstream
nature
of
deschutes
a
valiant
effort
that
produced
decent
results
not
necessarily
world
class
and
it
tastes
and
feels
like
it
could
use
a
touch
of
work
but
on
the
whole
its
impressive
and
i
definitely
look
forward
to
cracking
the
other
bottles
darn
i
paid
a
lot
for
this
10
and
was
really
hoping
for
something
really
special
from
the
22
oz
bottle
this
poured
a
cloudy
dark
orange
with
a
small
offwhite
head
and
very
little
lacing
nose
was
of
sour
cherry
and
vanilla
mouthfeel
medium
and
somewhat
fizzy
from
what
i
assume
is
the
carbonation
flavor
is
of
sour
fruit
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
acrid
overall
it
was
interesting
but
i
had
a
little
trouble
getting
it
all
down
for
me
a
bit
of
a
disappointmentt
maybe
aged
it
would
get
better
but
this
is
the
only
bottle
i
had
and
at
this
price
probably
the
last
the
taste
smooth
and
tart
to
the
heart
of
the
buds
then
softly
dissipated
you
really
get
the
fruity
esters
and
the
taste
of
sour
cherries
in
the
drink
it
is
not
abrasive
at
all
which
i
thought
it
might
be
due
to
the
funkness
it
seems
lightly
bittered
you
also
get
a
tad
bit
of
a
beer
that
has
been
oak
conditioned
a
little
bit
of
wood
with
this
one
overall
a
interesting
beer
that
was
worth
the
money
this
is
a
very
drinkable
flanders
and
one
that
is
not
overpoweringly
tart
or
funky
that
makes
it
a
very
good
beer
in
my
book
ill
definitely
revisit
this
one
over
time
and
see
how
it
ages
pours
a
hazy
reddishbrown
with
a
lackluster
tan
head
sharp
aromas
of
sour
cherry
and
yeast
vibrant
and
fruity
starts
off
tart
and
fizzy
with
bouncy
apple
and
sour
cherry
flavors
needs
to
warm
up
significantly
from
refrigerator
temps
to
show
all
its
complexity
as
it
warms
the
tight
sour
notes
open
up
to
more
vinous
dark
fruit
and
wood
some
toasty
oakvanilla
notes
almost
like
a
rich
california
chard
come
through
in
the
nose
and
again
in
the
finish
at
warmer
temps
by
the
end
it
is
supple
and
soft
with
some
black
fruit
and
red
grape
skin
flavors
but
it
becomes
a
little
watery
it
has
some
fleeting
moments
where
it
could
pass
for
an
oregon
pinot
noir
from
a
very
rainy
year
interesting
beer
but
seems
to
come
out
of
the
gate
too
fast
and
then
fades
at
the
finish
nonetheless
a
treat
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
d
very
interesting
a
nice
combo
of
flanders
and
red
wine
qualities
although
the
flanders
qualities
disipate
as
it
warms
this
one
would
be
great
with
a
little
more
funkiness
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
not
quite
as
sour
and
funky
as
the
classic
belgian
versions
but
sharp
enough
and
full
bodied
creamy
and
delcious
without
being
hot
despite
its
9
abv
the
beer
pours
a
classic
reddish
brown
with
a
fair
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
the
aromas
are
fairly
light
but
with
some
nice
sour
and
creamy
notes
and
a
light
metallic
tang
little
spice
the
taste
exhibits
some
funk
and
tannins
along
with
the
sour
tang
and
creaminess
some
slight
spiciness
throughout
the
taste
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
but
with
that
sour
tang
and
some
firm
tannins
lovely
to
drink
this
should
age
nicely
an
impressive
effort
at
a
sour
style
by
a
brewery
not
known
for
them
pours
a
mid
to
dark
copper
i
want
to
say
peach
as
well
light
head
heavy
fizzing
upon
pouring
smells
of
sweet
citrus
you
can
slightly
smell
the
sour
but
not
enough
to
give
it
away
this
is
definitely
a
sour
this
hits
the
pallet
with
an
intense
grapefruit
taste
subtle
malty
notes
hiding
in
the
back
to
bring
you
down
it
leaves
a
lemonade
sweet
flavor
on
my
lips
after
each
sip
this
is
one
of
the
first
sours
ive
really
enjoyed
i
can
see
this
one
getting
good
with
age
as
well
really
different
from
the
douches
but
i
get
thats
flemmish
definitely
a
good
beer
for
those
who
want
to
step
up
a
level
with
sours
d
i
wouldnt
call
this
highly
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
strong
and
ive
had
a
lot
more
enjoyable
sours
its
more
acidic
than
sour
poured
into
a

with

is

very
well
with
this

very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
highly
recommended
thanks
toby
d
this
one
needs
to
be
sipped
the
initial
aroma
is
quite
foul
but
once
you
get
beyond
that
the
beer
is
pretty
enjoyable

copper
with
a
fine
small

head
i
get
tart
sour
cherry
on
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
barrel
notes
the
taste
is
balanced
for
a
flanders
which
is
why
i
think
i
like
it
so
much
it
has
the
sour
acid
characteristic
with
a
very
subtle
hint
of
sweet
the
mouth
feel
is
fantastic
with
a
nice
weight
medium
that
suits
this
very
well
i
rated
the
drink
ability
higher
than
i
expected
and
it
is
good
but
not
something
i
would
want
every
day
notes
from
keg
are
very
similiar
to
the
bottle
another
sign
of
across
the
board
quality
this
is
a
unique
stab
at
the
flemish
red
style
full
in
body
and
high
in
abv
rodenbach
on
steroids
very
tasty
overall
still
good
i
might
give
it
slightly
better
scores
in
some
areas
and
slightly
worse
in
others
i
think
i
like
the
2012
better
but
maybe
letting
the
2010
settle
on
the
palate
a
little
more
will
reduce
the
impression
of
bitterness
nice
reddish
color
not
too
much
head
and
it
fades
fairly
quickly
smells
nice
but
not
overly
sour
taste
is
a
little
different
than
i
expected
definite
sour
aftertaste
but
a
nice
earthyfarmy
taste
through
the
middle
a
fellow
ba
says
it
tastes
like
a
creature
of
the
farm
but
he
means
that
in
the
best
way
possible
a
solid
effort
from

overall
drinkability
nice
looking
beer
but
with
my
first
few
sips
i
wasnt
sure
however
as
i
drank
more
of
it
it
grew
on
me
and
i
ended
up
having
another
glass
while
i
ended
up
sipping
on
it
over
the
dinner
i
found
by
the
end
of
the
first
glass
i
could
have
easily
downed
it
and
definitely
wanted
another
glass
to
savor
a
bit
more
so
drinkable
in
regards
to
the
fact
that
you
want
to
enjoy
it
slowly
over
a
longer
period
than
a
25
cl
glass
can
provide
tasting
the
beer
is
not
surprising
at
all
more
roasted
malts
sweetness
upfront
and
some
bitterness
in
the
rather
long
aftertaste
the
syruppy
mouthfeel
and
roasted
taste
make
me
think
of
a
stout
certainly
considering
the
very
low
level
of
carbonation
dr
hides
its
relatively
high
abv
well
but
is
lacking
in
quality
and
even
drinkability
on
account
of
the
unwarranted
coarseness
the
price
isnt
bad
in
holland
but
its
still
a
beer
i
wouldnt
havve
again
its
very
generic
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
bad
maybe
fans
of
the
style
would
appreciate
it
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
one
can
easily
find
beers
of
this
style
with
quite
a
bit
more
substance
theres
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
i
dont
think
id
seek
it
out
there
are
better
ales
of
this
style
that
are
more
plentiful
in
this
neck
of
the
woods
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
an
improvementno
plastic
here
there
are
notes
of
sweet
orange
with
a
light
bitterness
the
body
is
spot
on
a
nice
belgian
brown
drinkability
a
step
up
from
its
blonde
brother
but
thats
not
saying
too
terribly
much
some
might
say
you
cant
even
begin
to
spell
bruin
without
ruin
d
moderate
to
low
drinkability
highly
filling
with
all
the
carbonation
abv
is
ok
but
a
hair
difficult
lastly
the
flavors
just
do
get
a
bit
old
kinda
thin
feeling
and
pretty
fruity
in
the
mouth
surprisingly
malty
and
bready
taste
is
not
as
complex
as
the
smell
and
i
wish
the
yeast
gave
the
brew
a
bit
more
character
overall
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
one
but
then
again
i
was
expecting
a
tripel
smell
of
dark
fruits
raisins
cherries
chocolate
and
some
wet
earth
rough
earthy
flavour
taste
of
fruits
specially
cherries
with
caramel
notes
and
spices
interesting
but
theres
something
that
it
lacks
that
i
can
really
define
have
to
try
another
one
poured
with
a
big
big
frothy
foamy
tan
head
didnt
decant
and
it
had
lots
of
yeastoids
color
is
a
dark
hazy
brown
aroma
was
light
malty
yeasty
and
a
bit
fruity
flavor
was
similar
but
with
lots
of
caramel
and
toffee
champagnesque
carbonation
yeasty
taffy
bittersweet
finish
not
bad
could
easily
drink
more
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
hoping
for
maybe
a
bit
more
balanced
flavor
d
this
is
a
nice
and
interesting
beer
the
colour
is
fantastic
and
tartness
of
the
fruit
really
makes
it
an
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
provides
for
the
slightest
of
warming
sensations
as
the
beer
slides
down
your
throat
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
would
also
like
to
try

a

or
even
though
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
an

would
be
a

better
the
aroma
holds
sweet
candy
sugar
and
fruit
notes
with
a
rich
sweet
maltiness
and
mild
dirtdust
notes
the
body
is
a
cloudy
and
ruddy
brown
and
holds
a
massive
three
finger
thick
tan
head
that
is
both
bubbly
and
diminishing

flavor
on
the
initial
sip
there
are
some

it
feels
spent
like
it
once
had
flavor
and
couldnt
hold
onto
it
the
carbonation
is
tongue
tingling
but
not
out
of
control
and
the
lacing
is
non

with
foam
left
from
sips
quickly
sliding
down
the
inside
of
the

hohum
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
on
the
lighter
side
with
explosive
carbonation
that
rushes
all
over
the
palate
with
each
sip
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
would
mind
putting
back
another
and
the
abv
is
low
enough
to
where
that
wouldnt
be
a
problem
bought
this
on
a
whim
awhile
back
in
kentucky
and
im
glad
i
did
hopefully
ill
run
across
this
one
or
the
gold
cap
again
sometime
didnt
have
the
pouring
issues
with
this
one
that
ive
seen
in
other
reviews
this
was
the
other
half
of
a
free
four
pack
of
the
pilar
biters
cloudy
light
brown
with
thick
tan
head
great
retention
and
lacing
acidic
caramel
aroma
that
comes
back
in
the
flavor
sweet
sour
mix
was
nice
though
i
wouldve
liked
it
to
swing
one
way
or
the
other
a
bit
more
nice
caramel
apple
feeling
afterwards
so
i
think
that
ill
save
the
other
bottle
for
later
in
the
fall
tart
and
hearty
it
came
off
as
medium
bodied
and
finished
clean
drinkability
was
up
there
a
bit
a
really
uneven
beer
looks
great
but
the
smell
and
taste
are
forgettable
bavik
know
how
to
make
decent
beer
see
the
petrus
line
for
some
good
examples
they
should
drop
this
redundant
brand
imho
the
body
is
full
the
carbonation
is
out
of
control
and
the
flavor
is
sour
tart
overall
an
interesting
belgian
thats
worth
tasting
this
brew
spewed
beer
all
over
my
counter
when
i
opened
it
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
foam
all
over
the
place
and
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
backed
by
a
caramel
character
with
some
acidic
sourness
along
with
some
sour
apples
the
flavor
follows
suit
very
well
quite
tart
at
first
but
also
complex
once
my
palate
gets
used
to
the
sourness
theres
a
strong
backing
of
toasted
malts
in
this
one
as
well
the
body
is
ok
but
it
seems
to
be
way
overcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
aaaarg
beer
all
over
the
countertop
anytime
you
open
a
bottle
and
the
beer
errupts
from
the
bottle
in
a
wall
of
foam
and
you
waste
34
of
your
beer
to
over
gushing
it
doesnt
leave
a
good
impression
ok
now
that
things
have
settled
down
the
beer
smells
quite
wonderful
solid
belgian
matured
malts
spicy
and
sweet
only
with
a
woodsy
musky
aroma
that
sets
it
apart
looks
well
flat
now
but
it
has
a
nice
murky
brown
rust
color
with
a
fine
lacing
tastes
sweet
with
malts
and
fruitiness
but
rounded
by
spiciness
bold
and
robust
woody
nutty
characters
fruits
remind
me
of
overripe
peaches
pears
kiwis
and
dates
the
beer
is
smooth
but
flat
on
the
palate
it
weakens
into
the
finish
finishes
sweet
spicy
and
lightly
sugary
a
good
beer
but
id
like
to
try
one
without
the
volcano
impression
pilaarbijter
looks
like
it
translates
to
pillar
biter
that
cant
be
right
i
thought
until
i
spotted
the
obviously
anguished
character
munching
on
a
pillar
right
there
on
the
label
those
wacky
belgians
this
is
an
okay
version
a
flanders
oud
bruin
and
not
an
entirely
accurate
one
in
the
end
but
thats
where
it
begins
and
ends
heres
hoping
the
brasscapped
version
is
more
to
my
liking
and
less
explosive
i
enjoyed
this
beer
although
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
drinkaibilty
wow
i
dig
both
beers
from
this
brewery
this
one
is
very
refeshing
you
cant
even
notice
the
abv
as
well
its
over
80
degrees
outside
and
this
one
hit
the
spot
very
drinkable
brew
even
though
it
really
doesnt
fall
into
an
oud
bruin
or
tripel
category
not
sweet
enough
or
strong
enough
for
a
tripel
and
doesnt
have
that
tart
puckering
kick
for
an
oud
bruin
still
a
very
good
brew
conclusion
a
fair
beer
in
a
style
thats
not
my
favourite
drinkability

this
wasnt
all
that
bad
it
completely
missed
the
essence
of
the
style
though
and
felt
clumsy
on
the
palate
11
2
ounce
bottle
dark
with
a
red
cap
purchased
at
greens
in
atlanta
for
3
50
i
doubt
this
is
an
oud
bruin
more
of
a
one
off
style
closer
to
a
belgian
dark
or
a
dubbel
nothing
bad
at
all
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
again
mouthfeel
was
crisp
at
the
start
and
finish
sour
cherries
softly
lingers
into
aftertaste
medium
heavy
in
body
decent
drinkability
since
flavors
are
mellower
than
expected
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
it
paired
well
with
pizza
at
lucky
baldwins
nicely
layered
front
is
dark
malts
caramel
and
chocolate
with
nuts
towards
the
end
the
fruit
notes
come
out
espeically
cherries
and
grapes
not
the
most
complex
beer
not
surprising
given
its
origins
from
bavik
but
its
an
admirable
effort
i
opened
this
puppy
on
my
balcony
16
hours
after
purchase
boy
was
i
glad
i
was
outside
i
lost
almost
13
of
the
bottle
to
overblown
rootbeer
like
foam
that
just
kept
going
and
going
and
going
it
would
have
been
an
incredible
mess
in
the
house
what
was
left
poured
a
medium
brown
translucent
root
beer
is
not
a
bad
description
of
the
color
that
obviously
had
a
monstrous
offwhite
head
aroma
is
soft
and
bready
with
moderate
sweetness
and
a
very
slight
hop
note
flavor
is
of
honey
and
sweetbreads
with
that
same
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
a
nice
brew
not
great
but
very
drinkable
i
tried
this
and
the
pilaarbijter
blond
in
sequence
and
this
is
the
better
of
the
two
from
an
11
2
oz
bottle
its
reddish
brown
with
a
fairly
active
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
little
bubbles
even
after
the
head
dies
down
a
bit
as
with
the
blond
version
both
the
smell
and
taste
are
decidedly
subdued
this
is
a
decent
brew
thats
quite
drinkable
with
nothing
offputting
in
the
smell
or
taste
too
many
great
belgians
are
out
there
to
go
looking
for
this
one
again
overall
definitely
a
big
disappointment
if
you
are
expecting
a
full
blown
abbey
tripel
lol
this
is
most
certainly
mislabeled
someone
at
bavik
screwed
up
big
time
much
more
of
a
bruin
with
flemish
influences
here
and
there
for
the
same
price
as
the
blond
2
99
for
the
33cl
bottle
hitimes
costa
mesa
i
think
i
would
opt
to
pick
up
the
blond
in
preference
to
the
bruin
and
stick
with
the
duchesse
when
i
need
a
flemish
brune
still
this
is
well
worth
a
try
if
you
are
looking
for
an
entry
level
bruin
drinkable
not
really
not
something
i
will
buy
again
a
decent
enough
flavor
and
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
not
much
depth
at
all
and
not
at
all
what
i
would
expect
for
the
style
pretty
boring
overall
impression
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
and
the
cap
were
rimmed
with
dried
sediment
bottle
must
have
been
stored
upside
down
for
a
long
time
an
ok
beer
a
bit
different
than
the
usual
bruine
but
not
spectacular
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
mahogany
color
with
a
smallish
off
white
head
that
is
frothy
in
texture
the
lace
is
adequate
to
cover
the
glass
nose
has
a
sweet
and
sour
aroma
hint
of
yeast
crisp
and
clean
to
the
senses
start
is
tart
and
the
top
thin
in
its
feel
finish
is
acerbic
fair
hop
profile
sour
and
very
dry
aftertaste
cant
really
say
it
was
bad
but
really
not
a
good
representative
to
the
style
in
my
humble
opinion
much
better
options
out
there
this
one
fell
flat
for
me
o
not
as
fruity
as
i
would
like
but
still
an
excellent
sour
beer
sour
lemonapple
aroma
light
refreshing
base
with
good
acidity
level
tart
green
apple
flavor
i
later
found
this
brew
at
a
local
store
and
it
beckons
me
from
time
to
time
a
mistress
in
a
bottle
i
wanted
to
like
it
due
to
all
the
great
reviews
it
has
however
i
personally
found
it
rather
unpalatable
slightly
sweet
mostly
bitter
odd
fizz
tart
smell
similar
to
prosecco
or
champagne
taste
caught
me
off
guard
its
definitely
an
acquired
one
personally
not
for
me
but
glad
i
tried
it
mouthfeel
somewhat
light
but
really
nice
drinking
al
in
all
starts
with
a
lemony
citrusy
tart
nose
with
traces
of
vinegar
it
pours
a
rich
gold
sour
on
the
nose
1
head
dissipates
to
a
film
leaves
fine
lace
big
lemony
palate
supported
by
traces
of
light
fruit
sweetness
balancing
between
plum
and
cherry
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
slight
oak
astringency
and
a
hop
accent
on
the
finish
overall
a
great
little
beer
that
probably
serves
as
a
nice
gateway
to
sours
the
smell
and
taste
profile
on
this
are
awesome
and
im
wishing
i
had
picked
up
a
couple
more
in
fact
this
is
good
enough
to
warrant
a
beer
run
all
on
its
own
final
grade
4
39
a
very
solid
a
grade
i
do
not
have
any
previous
experience
with
this
specific
style
of
beer
nor
would
i
consider
myself
a
big
fan
of
sours
in
general
but
petrus
aged
pale
is
quite
possibly
my
favourite
sour
so
far
the
funky
acidity
and
the
tannins
from
the
barrel
result
in
an
eminently
quaffable
unique
little
brew
that
has
gone
a
long
way
towards
changing
my
opinion
of
sours
a
good
gateway
sour
due
to
the
affordable
price
point
and
approachable
flavour
profile
i
will
definitely
make
sure
to
procure
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
for
the
cellar
since
i
dont
expect
this
to
remain
available
in
ontario
indefinitely
im
burping
acid
a
little
bit
o
very
reminiscent
of
well
made
acidic
white
wine
cant
say
whether
or
not
the
oak
aging
did
much
for
the
flavor
but
i
would
certainly
purchase
this
again
regardless
enjoyable
to
sip
on
and
appreciate
enjoy
o
a
great
beer
for
those
who
like
complex
white
wines
a
solid
mix
of
sour
oak
barrel
fruit
and
funk
tart
apple
goodness
with
a
bit
of
oak
dry
as
hell
and
keeps
you
wanting
more
very
well
done
one
of
only
a
couple
of
beers
that
was
poured
down
the
drain
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
but
it
wasnt
everything
i
was
hoping
for
the
taste
was
good
but
i
would
tweak
it
a
bit
as
described
above
also
i
would
like
more
of
a
pale
ale
aspect
to
this
beer
if
you
want
a
sour
pale
ale
get
jolly
pumpkins
luciernaga
instead
of
this
if
you
dont
care
about
the
pale
ale
aspect
this
beer
will
be
cheaper
than
luciernaga
also
after
looking
it
up
this
beer
is
classified
by
ba
as
a
flanders
oud
bruin
whereas
luciernaga
is
a
belgian
pale
i
guess
that
explains
the
differences
one
of
the
best
sours
ive
tasted
really
good
but
not
sure
if
champaign
or
beer
lol
great
sour
beer
thats
easy
to
get
flowery
with
a
hint
of
apple
sour
apple
maybe
very
sour
with
a
slight
lingering
tartness
very
good
delicious
sour
beer
golden
pour
with
moderate
head
a
fruity
sour
with
slight
citrusy
tart
aftertaste
with
hints
of
apple
was
too
tiring
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
my
thing
had
a
touch
of
woody
taste
after
getting
past
the
sour
acidity
very
brett
foward
its
not
my
favorite
because
i
like
my
sours
to
be
a
little
more
tart
but
i
can
appreciate
this
one
not
my
cup
of
tea
stouts
and
ipas
please
again
not
my
taste
but
i
wanted
to
try
this
style
petrus
aged
pale
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
its
a
perfect
sour
ale
retaining
the
quality
flavors
of
a
pale
ale
while
still
having
the
great
sour
flavors
it
i
could
only
drink
one
beer
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
one
might
be
it
food
pairings
dirty
grapes
and
chicken
whambam
75ml
corked

exceptionally
smooth
and
drinkable
for
a
sour

lightly

medium
golden
with

soft

taste
is

this
one
has
me
rethinking
sour
ales
most
of
which
are
too
tart
for
my
palate
overall
id
highly
recommend
whether
or
not
you
are
just
interested
in
trying
new
styles
of
beer
or
are
already
a
sour
fan
great
sour
lots
of
wood
character
bitter
for
the
first
second
then
sour
a
mineral
cakey
layer
lingers
with
the
sour
patch
party
o
great
tasting
sour
that
is
light
and
refreshing
the
flavoring
is
balanced
well
for
an
aged
beer
wasnt
to
sour
and
had
mild
hop
notes
very
good
stuff
extremely
balanced
for
a
sour
very
drinkable
my
wallet
is
going
to
hate
me
soon
trying
more
sours
overall
is
tasty
complex
refreshing
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
wish
there
were
other
notes
than
the
apple
kind
of
dominates
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
interesting
keeps
the
beer
from
being
too
easy
drinking
will
have
to
try
more
sours
when
i
want
sour
this
would
be
a
great
goto
beer
perfect
on
a
hot
summers
day
a
little
too
sour
for
me
to
drink
in
large
quantities
but
so
refreshing
i
think
that
this
is
a
great
representative
of
the
style
o
very
nice
sour
much
better
than
the
rest
in
the
sour
power
sixer
nice
full
sour
with
complex
flavors
and
a
good
balance
poured
from
a
330
into
a
standard
pint
the
tulip
was
dirty
and
i
was
lazy
the
light
haze
in
the
gold
was
lovely
the
aroma
offered
a
hint
of
the
sour
to
come
with
some
citrussy
character
from
a
hoppy
beer
but
the
taste
was
just
a
wonderful
level
tartness
that
was
like
nothing
i
had
encountered
this
is
the
beer
that
set
me
off
on
a
long
run
of
sours
it
is
therefore
my
benchmark
since
it
was
my
first
sour
i
may
revise
once
i
have
had
more
from
this
style
but
this
will
be
a
repeat
purchase

comkajiisbeerreviews
bright
and
tart
undecided
if
this
is
likable
and
need
to
consider
others
in
the
same
style
certainly
drinkable
and
with
the
bracing
acidity
would
work
well
with
food
beautiful
tart
yet
immensely
drinkable
great
with
all
types
of
food
i
keep
coming
back
to
this
beer
time
after
time
and
it
never
disappoints
in
fact
as
im
writing
this
my
mouth
is
water
just
thinking
about
this
golden
brew
give
this
classic
a
try
if
you
havent
already
o
very
interesting
likely
an
excellent
meal
compliment
but
definitely
a
conversation
piece
at
least
best
enjoyed
slowly
and
with
friends
o
a
very
nice
readily
available
sour
very
crisp
and
refreshing
on
draft
at
monks
cafe
in
philly
i
tried
this
headtohead
with
the
monks
flemish
sour
ale
although
this
was
a
very
good
oud
bruin
it
paled
in
comparison
the
the
monks
version
very
session
able
and
may
have
received
a
higher
rating
if
i
had
it
on
a
different
session
but
much
weaker
in
taste
and
higher
in
alcohol
basically
the
light
version
of
the
monks
flemish
with
higher
abv
personally
i
rate
based
on
flavor
not
for
speed
of
inebriation
o
4

this
beer
is
easy
to
get
and
very
pleasing
if
youre
looking
to
satisfy
a
sour
craving
there
are
a
lot
of
really
nice
flavors
and
a
good
tartness
level
not
quite
up
there
with
some
of
the
popular
gueuze
offerings
but
a
solid
alternative
and
thats
where
the
ale
fleets
the
palate
with
abrupt
dryness
clean
crisp
and
sudden
far
sooner
than
the
palate
would
prefer
the
taste
evaporates
in
a
whimsical
cloud
that
overs
above
the
tongue
much
of
its
wonderment
is
better
appreciated
in
a
wheaty
vinous
aftertaste
full
of
oak
tanning
than
it
is
in
actual
time
o
this
is
an
affordable
and
remarkable
sour
beer
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
very
nice
sour
with
lots
of
puckering
notes
overall
my
go
to
sour
always
delivers
and
always
available
at
a
decent
price
a
little
skunkiness
with
this
bottle
i
havent
had
on
the
others
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
a
little
too
long
o
a
refreshing
beer
with
some
nice
clean
sourness
and
just
a
touch
of
funk
not
overly
complex
but
an
enjoyable
summer
sour
petrus
aged
pale
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
lighter
looking
sour
that
could
pass
for
many
types
of
good
ales
smell
is
fantastic
as
the
tart
sour
really
comes
through
a
lighter
sour
oaky
taste
that
is
very
quenchable
great
for
a
summer
day
great
beer
though
i
prefer
something
a
bit
bolder
but
for
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
trying
to
be
it
is
very
good
the
great
flavors
linger
in
the
aftertaste
great
sour
finishes
strong
lingering
on
the
palate
in
a
pleasantly
funky
way
until
displaced
by
some
well
timed
pickled
carrots
and
cheese
i
have
had
this
beer
several
times
before
and
i
would
consider
it
a
classic
at
this
point
it
has
a
great
reputation
in
the
belgian
beer
world
and
it
truly
deserves
it
kind
of
like
a
belgian
berliner
in
a
way
but
much
more
than
that
at
the
same
time

mild

with
plenty
of
drying
oak
character
body
is
a
little
thin
but
nice
flavors
though
a
bit
onenote
on
the
tartness
overall
very
dry
and
sour
beer
that
may
reind
you
more
of
a
wine
than
a
beer
i
think
it
comes
together
well
and
would
recommend
it
perhaps
a
perfect
introduction
to
sour
beers
little
to
no
head
and
slight
lacing
on
this
well
carbonated
brew
smelling
a
bit
of
vinegar
and
wood
wonderful
vinegar
tartness
easily
one
of
the
better
sour
brews
ive
had
its
well
balanced
great

brew
for
newbies
dangerously
drinkable
for

o
great

very
sour
acidic
great
representation
of
style
will
purchase
again
overall
i
wouldnt
need
to
revisit
this
offering
very
often
overall
good
sour
ultimately
lacks
complexity
but
the
sourness
is
pronounced
i
do
recommend
and
i
would
buy
again
this
is
a
very
good
beer
despite
it
not
being
what
id
expect
from
an
oud
bruin
new
to
sours
and
this
one
seems
pretty
complex
but
has
some
great
flavours
going
on
overall
good
to
really
good
but
mostly
really
good
isnt
the
most
complex
sour
ive
ever
had
but
i
do
enjoy
that
this
is
rather
smooth
for
a
sour
this
worth
a
try
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
in
the
future
i
probably
wont
buy
it
anytime
soon
but
i
would
drink
this
again
in
the
right
setting
o
an
excellent
no
frills
sour

is

available

o
4

its
good
nice
and
sour
the
cool
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
a
basic
sour
beer
without
added
fruit
and
without
being
a
darker
beer
so
you
really
get
the
sour
characteristics
by
themselves
the
downside
is
basically
the
same
thing
its
just
sour
and
perfectly
sour
but
not
that
complex
o
a
very
good
sour
pale
ale
this
is
one
that
i
will
regularly
reach
for
when
im
looking
for
a
cheap
and
relatively
available
sour
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
belgian
goblet
my
first
crack
at
this
style
which
is
rather
difficult
to
find
in
these
parts
hoping
that
more
examples
turn
up
this
sour
is
a
golden
orange
amber
hue
with
ample
beige
foam
features
larger
bubbles
than
the
flanders
reds
from
rodenbach
i
have
sampled
smells
very
carbolic
like
white
wine
vinegar
along
with
zesty
lemon
juice
and
a
tannic
woodiness
taste
is
a
fascinating
blend
of
aggressive
sour
and
caramel
sweetness
theres
a
gentle
sweet
backbone
of
vanilla
nougat
dairybased
confectionery
carob
and
raisins
with
a
hint
of
dried
banana
chip
with
all
this
lurking
beneath
another
tart
factor
that
recalls
sour
gummy
candies
unripe
cherry
pomegranate
molasses
green
apple
tangerine
peel
and
grainy
vinegar
to
my
palate
the
sourness
is
about
on
par
with
rodenbach
grand
cru
maybe
even
a
hair
more
with
a
thin
body
and
rather
prickly
carbonation
finishes
dry
acidic
and
woody
a
tasty
introduction
to
the
style
and
to
sours
more
generally
worth
a
try
and
if
you
are
not
sweetadverse
worth
a
pack
n
you
couldnt
session
this
beer
but
why
would
you
its
something
you
bring
out
to
change
things
up
it
is
so
tart
to
start
but
then
it
mellows
would
go
well
with
a
tangy
cheese
and
some
classical
music
this
is
a
beer
to
be
sipped
and
savored
o
complexity
may
not
be
the
central
characteristic
of
this
beer
but
the
tanginess
tartness
and
white
wine
flavours
imparted
to
this
beer
from
its
oak
aging
are
clean
crisp
and
neatly
done
this
is
a
beer
elegant
and
assured
in
its
simplicity
and
one
which
i
hope
will
serve
as
an
excellent
launch
point
for
exploring
sour
and
wild
ales

goes

though
smooth
is
the
last
adjective
id
attach
to
this
one
i
think
this
beverage
is
doing
serious
damage
to
my
stomach
lining
otherwise
sure
its
a
good
sour
nothing
out
of
this
world
but
a
very
drinkable
brew
o
a
puckering
sipper
that
has
some
nice
fruity
flavors
complimented
by
some
nice
barrel
notes
my
favorite
from
petrus
o
very
enjoyable
but
probably
too
sour
to
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
nice
flavors
and
acidic
prickliness
a
surprisingly
incredible
beer
o
a
great
sour
easy
to
come
by
the
apple
taste
overall
not
as
great
as
the
wine
barrel
aged
sours
but
good
price
availability
makes
it
a
winner

dominant
flavors
are

some

crisp
dry

keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
a
bit
expensive
but
worthy
of
trying
and
fairly
accessible
to
the
masses
o
great
for
building
the
palate
up
to
more
complexed
sours
but
more
easily
attainable
than
others
this
is
a
beer
that
helped
introduce
me
to
a
style
id
otherwise
ignore
thank
you
petrus
and
may
i
somehow
receive
one
of
your
wooden
casks
final
thoughts
im
basically
a
sour
noob
but
for
what
its
worth
i
really
liked
this
one
the
amount
of
tartness
in
the
flavor
was
higher
than
ive
had
recently
and
it
made
for
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
i
got
petrus
aged
pale
as
part
of
the
sour
power
mixed
pack
and
it
was
a
worthwhile
purchase
that
id
recommend
to
anyone
interested
in
the
experimenting
with
the
style
for
the
first
time
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
great
beer
overall
a
very
tasty
sour
it
lacks
a
lot
of
complexity
but
the
beer
is
so
crisp
and
bright
on
the
tongue
that
it
more
than
makes
up
for
it
it
is
also
refreshing
that
the
beer
is
not
overly
barnyard
or
funky
solid
blonde
sour
not
too
complex
nothing
special
its
certainly
not
an
oud
bruin
in
my
opinion
good
gateway
sour
but
its
not
something
id
lose
my
mind
over
overall
a
very
decent
sour
it
is
able
to
satisfy
a
sour
craving
but
does
lack
complexity
this
is
a
great
introductory
sour
as
there
is
nothing
too
offense
or
bold
or
funky
also
it
is
readily
available
and
affordable
at
4bottle
i
like
to
keep
a
few
of
these
around
for
a
refreshing
weeknight
delight
o
i
didnt
like
it
off
the
bat
but
it
got
better
as
it
sat
in
the
glass
and
warmed
up
even
more
but
i
still
didnt
love
it
petrus
pours
a
primarily
clear
golden
color
with
some
hints
of
bronze
theres
a
thin
ring
of
pure
white
sitting
on
top
the
aroma
was
an
excellent
bouquet
of
floral
and
fruit
scents
with
a
slight
suggestion
of
funky
yeast
as
well
the
taste
revealed
the
benefits
of
aging
with
a
pleasant
earthiness
and
a
tasty
cider
sourness
very
tart
and
winelike
moderate
body
with
a
dry
mouth
feel
i
would
have
loved
to
have
a
nice
cheese
plate
with
this
maybe
next
time
order
this
when
you
can
fully
appreciate
its
delicate
beauty
this
is
one
fine
sour
excellent
stuff
perhaps
the
best
offering
from
this
brewery
despite
not
seeming
too
bottleconditioned
i
feel
this
would
develop
very
well
in
the
bottle
over
time
its
interesting
to
see
a
belgian
pale
turned
upside
down
and
becoming
a
refreshing
and
complex
offering
as
a
sour
beer
the
oak
and
yeast
are
the
stars
here
but
that
belgian
sweetness
which
can
get
grating
is
far
different
here
and
resembling
actual
offdry
fruit
rather
than
something
more
mundane
recommended
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
the
sour
power
pack
just
to
get
2
bottles
at
4
a
bottle
elsewhere
however
this
is
a
good
bargain
indeed
i
had
an
extraordinary
sensation
on
my
tongue
on
my
first
sip
although
my
brain
noticed
it
was
different
than
previous
sour
experiences
it
gave
me
a
positive
message
good
stuff
go
for
it
very
tart
and
original
i
keep
a
four
pack
of
these
on
hand
for
every
occasion
usually
the
occasion
is
that
its
after
six
oclock
and
im
celebrating
the
existence
of
beer
in
general
and
this
wondrous
beer
specifically
overall
a
very
nice
sour
worth
a
try
if
the
style
appeals
to
you
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
thats
lighter
in
character
than
most
oud
bruins
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
sample
it
makes
it
a
little
more
refreshing
but
also
a
little
bit
onenote
in
my
opinion
mf
light
and
acidic
drying
and
bubbly
overall
a
curveball
of
a
beer
very
interesting
and
unexpected
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
this
one
again
o
despite
not
looking
like
much
this
is
one
of
the
tastiest
and
easily
accessible
sours
out
there
super
tart
and
refreshing
it
turns
out
that
the
tenounce
pour
was
just
right
for
me
enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast
as
they
say
i
like
this
one
alright
and
id
happily
drink
it
again
to
satiate
my
wild
ale
thirst
lowish
b
great
beer
far
from
being
a
bruin
but
essentially
a
pale
sour
i
liked
this
alot
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
light
body
with
a
slight
amount
of
sour
stickiness
that
leaves
this
very
drinkable
o
a
well
done
sour
ale
readily
available
and
enjoyable
pours
a
clear
nice
color
not
a
lot
of
head
but
smells
sour
and
amazing
tart
tart
tart
smell
cant
wait
to
taste
this
mmm
mmm
makes
my
mouth
pucker
but
damn
thats
cleansing
and
refreshing
a
nice
palate
cleanser
after
something
that
might
wreck
your
palate
learning
more
about
the
sour
style
and
loving
every
min
of
it
lets
drink
more
11
2oz
bottle
pours
a
golden
yellow
sparkling
almost
champagne
like
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
is
of
belgian
yeast
biscuit
malt
with
ripe
fruity
notes
taste
is
mildly
tart
and
sour
with
some
belgian
yeast
has
a
kind
of
sour
fruit
slightly
vinegary
white
wine
palate
is
a
medium
body
with
mild
carbonation
and
sweet
tart
sourness
on
the
tongue
finish
same
as
taste
with
some
faint
notes
of
malt
on
the
end
gives
it
slight
balance
overall
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
yet
a
drinkable
brew
none
the
less
finally
getting
to
try
this
old
acquaintance
from
back
east
once
again
it
pours
a
clear
lemonstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
tart
lemon
zest
a
pinch
of
coriander
and
some
rather
light
and
demure
cracked
wheat
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
even
tarter
lemon
dominating
all
else
in
a
pleasant
warheads
type
of
way
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
tasty
sour
treat
something
you
dont
necessarily
come
across
every
day
but
something
you
wouldnt
mind
indulging
in
that
often
o
a
nice
aceticfocused
pale
ale
hits
the
spot
when
im
in
the
mood
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tulip
the
beer
is
an
extremely
bright
straw
gold
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
white
head
that
starts
around
half
an
inch
but
settles
into
a
ring
on
the
surface
aromas
are
tart
and
sweet
robust
and
forward
with
notes
of
apple
toasted
grains
and
subtle
woody
highlights
mouth
watering
nose
flavors
are
bold
and
tart
with
an
underlying
roasted
character
almost
charlike
toasty
grainbread
notes
noticeable
initially
but
they
are
quickly
swallowed
up
by
the
sour
characteristics
with
a
tangy
sweetness
that
keeps
the
drinkability
high
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
woody
and
char
characteristics
but
with
a
solid
ribbon
of
tart
still
present
clean
smooth
finish
with
a
slight
puckering
very
drinkable
throughout
solid
brew
the
taste
is
most
definitely
a
sour
ale
alcohol
is
well
integrated
dont
try
to
sugarcoat
it
or
anything
it
will
come
up
just
the
same
so
as
far
as
sour
ales
go
this
really
meets
or
exceeds
to
style
it
really
is
not
my
favorite
style
so
it
is
difficult
to
review
sour
ale
fans
will
like
this
one
overall
fairly
new
to
the
style
but
i
like
this
as
an
introduction
i
dont
know
if
im
getting
acid
reflux
or
if
its
just
the
beer
in
my
throat
excellent
on
the
first
day
of
summer
not
overly
complex
but
being
fairly
new
im
still
getting
used
to
the
sour
you
know
you
always
seem
them
on
the
shelf
pick
one
up
already
poured
from
the
11
2
ounce
bottle
into
a
petrus
chalice
ciderlike
aroma
one
finger
of
foam
quickly
dissipates
golden
color
super
dry
and
definitely
more
tart
than
the
oud
bruin
i
swear
this
reminds
me
of
my
homemade
cider
which
i
wish
were
this
good
bet
this
would
be
grand
with
brunch
i
definitely
like
it
what
other
treasures
does
this
brewery
have
awesome
beer
here
and
whats
even
better
is
that
you
can
easily
pick
this
stuff
off
of
most
shelves
around
town
definitely
a
brew
thats
sour
and
funky
enough
to
please
longtime
fans
of
the
style
while
remaining
mild
and
tame
enough
to
not
scare
newcomers
away
reasonably
priced
for
the
quality
and
amount
as
well
one
of
the
better
examples
of
blonde
belgian
sours
that
are
easy
to
obtain
o
if
this
is
what
i
can
expect
from
a
stronggood
sour
then
they
might
not
be
my
favorite
i
prefer
kind
of
a
sweet
tartness
or
a
very
carbonated
one
like
a
kombucha
i
like
stuff
closer
to
rodenbach
classic
not
for
me
and
i
love
apple
cider
first
sour
beer
ive
drank
not
the
type
of
beer
i
would
normally
drink
and
not
quite
sure
im
a
fan
of
sour
beers
this
is
a
light
and
very
sour
slightly
fruity
beer
very
tasty
sour
ale
great
flavor
a
musttry
for
fans
of
the
style
overall
a
nice
acidic
sour
its
very
sour
and
a
little
sweet
and
candylike
duchesse
but
not
too
sweet
sour
enough
to
make
it
tasty
but
not
overbearing
different
from
many
sours
ive
had
since
most
have
been
red
my
favorite
probably
not
a
good
option
certainly
best
of
the
three
petrus
beers
overall
drinkability
takes
some
getting
used
to
but
this
will
wake
you
up
world
class
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
had
its
a
pale
yellow
not
unlike
hoegaarden
the
taste
comes
on
strong
and
kicks
you
in
the
tongue
with
sourness
but
its
not
unpleasant
as
you
drink
more
the
sourness
subsides
and
flavors
of
orange
and
tang
are
left
is
a
beer
that
appeals
to
different
areas
of
the
tongue
it
also
displays
flavors
of
oak
due
to
the
aging
so
we
have
flavors
of
oak
orange
sour
green
wood
and
hops
to
bring
it
all
together
and
its
tame
enough
to
drink
nonstop
fantastic
overall
will
revisit
this
after
i
gain
a
bit
more
experience
with
the
style
very
interesting
o
much
better
than
the
regular
petrus
flanders
beer
more
bold
sour
flavors
that
go
so
well
with
the
other
complext
tastes
ill
definitely
have
this
again
overall
a
very
puckering
sour
ale
that
certainly
scratches
that
sour
itch
if
youre
having
a
craving
unfortunately
the
sourness
is
a
bit
one
note
and
doesnt
have
a
big
funky
brett
presence
to
embellish
it
it
is
a
solid
somewhat
easily
attainable
sour
that
doesnt
necessarily
wow
a
seasoned
sour
drinker
poured
one
finger
of
head
on
a
clear
golden
colored
body
the
smell
is
all
sour
but
in
a
nice
way
the
taste
has
moderate
bitterness
followed
by
a
strong
sour
flavor
good
balance
the
texture
is
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
quite
an
interesting
ale
with
some
great
flavors
that
you
dont
see
much
of
it
was
ciderlike
in
texture
and
taste
but
less
sweet
othe
appearance
and
smell
for
this
beer
are
good
but
not
great
the
taste
and
feel
however
do
achieve
greatness
it
is
very
drinkable
for
its
higherish
abv
and
maintains
a
great
sour
flavor
i
could
drink
these
for
days
and
normally
i
reach
a
limit
with
sour
beers
this
i
wish
came
by
the
six
pack
i
highly
recommend
you
try
this
especially
if
you
like
sours
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
sour
very
good
and
highly
recommended
as
much
as
i
appreciate
the
artistry
and
craft
involved
in
making
this
beer
it
was
hard
to
drink
a
sour
beer
of
this
caliber
is
no
easier
to
drink
than
a
fine
scotch
sipping
is
the
best
way
to
approach
the
color
is
a
dull
without
being
hazy
the
nose
a
tart
lactic
acidic
burn
the
taste
followed
the
nose
with
a
sour
acidic
bile
flavor
masking
the
taste
of
malts
and
hops
hints
of
vanilla
greenness
and
wood
are
undetectable
under
the
acid
burn
sweet
caramel
and
grain
show
up
in
the
aftertaste
and
comes
on
after
the
sour
acid
fades
away
the
mouthfeel
is
as
thin
as
would
be
expected
with
a
carbonated
bite
that
helps
the
flavor
along
all
in
all
this
is
a
beer
that
i
highly
appreciate
and
have
no
desire
to
drink
again
serving
type
bottle
o
too
sour
for
me
i
like
my
flanders
with
a
bit
more
sweetness
for
balance
a
sipping
beer
no
swiling
this
brew
overall
wow
i
might
have
to
get
more
of
these
soon
pretty
solid
beer
overall
really
tasty
beer
and
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
surprise
considering
i
wasnt
that
impressed
with
the
petrus
oud
bruin
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
if
you
see
it
purchased
ontap
at
hotshots
family
entertainment
center
in
beautiful
downtown
pismo
beach
ca
on
a
rainy
thursday
evening
this
selection
was
a
fine
nightcap
a
palette
cleanser
after
an
evening
of
drinking
heavy
syrupy
beers
parobla
ovila
quad
black
marlin
porter
this
sour
was
simple
and
sufficient
a
pleasure
to
be
what
ended
our
drinking
evening
o
this
one
definitely
delivers
the
sour
puckering
bite
to
it
and
at
a
decent
price
to
boot
i
really
wish
it
was
fruitier
but
thats
just
nitpicking
id
definitely
consider
making
this
one
a
goto
sour
for
me
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
nectar
of
the
gods
amazingly
balanced
sour
beer
will
grab
many
more
for
aging
and
drinking
poured
from
tap
into
tulip
at
1702
in
tucson
pours
a
straw
color
with
nice
fizzy
head
that
lasts
lots
of
funk
and
tart
belgian
aromas
same
for
taste
nicely
tart
fruity
belgian
yeast
and
grape
like
super
refreshing
and
nicely
drinkable
nice
brew
good
amount
of
sourtart
i
poured
a
goldenlooking
beer
which
unfortunately
had
a
poor
retention
in
my
example
here
the
aroma
is
intriguing
apricots
and
barnyardlike
tones
associated
with
brettanomyces
as
well
as
other
acidproducing
bacteria
the
light
crisp
body
leaves
a
relatively
long
aftertaste
showcasing
of
course
the
tartness
and
the
woodaged
taste
that
this
beer
conveyed
during
the
whole
sampling
again
not
sure
if
it
was
the
beer
or
the
pourer
330
ml
bottle
the
last
one
in
a
box
of
six
different
petrus
beers
poured
into
a
snifter
abv
73
colour
is
deep
copper
with
quite
an
activity
in
the
glass
on
top
of
the
beer
sits
a
big
white
head
almost
three
fingers
soapy
and
thick
with
good
retention
aroma
is
of
grapes
sweetsour
some
citrus
notes
in
it
very
high
acidity
on
the
taste
this
one
screams
sour
again
lots
of
white
grapes
on
the
taste
after
my
initial
big
gulp
where
i
almost
choke
from
the
acidity
i
started
drinking
it
with
slow
small
sips
and
its
quite
good
full
body
and
average
carbonation
a
combination
of
dryness
and
tartness
on
the
palate
still
not
very
experienced
on
this
style
but
i
liked
this
one
reminded
me
of
a
homemade
wine
an
uncle
of
mine
was
making
so
maybe
its
also
the
memories
but
this
beer
was
quite
enjoyable
and
i
guess
it
would
be
even
better
with
a
meal
o
this
stuff
was
so
sour
it
gave
me
a
stomach
ache
threw
the
last
14
of
it
out
i
hated
it
that
much
it
tasted
like
sparkling
grape
juice
that
had
gone
bad
paid
4
for
a
bottle
would
have
rather
thrown
it
in
the
street
o
this
was
by
far
the
most
sour
beer
ive
ever
tasted
including
lambics
it
made
my
taste
buds
cry
this
is
a
sipping
beer
it
took
me
and
hour
to
drink
it
at
first
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
sour
tartness
but
every
sip
was
more
pleasurable
and
by
the
end
i
realize
how
complex
this
brew
was
could
i
drink
this
every
night
no
way
but
this
is
a
beer
to
be
savored
do
not
buy
this
taste
is
nicely
soured
with
green
apple
tones
most
prominent
i
get
no
trace
of
the
oak
barrels
that
this
was
aged
in
instead
its
a
wild
and
tangy
tart
fruit
vibe
with
a
slight
warming
finish
a
delicious
treat
overall
nice
different
beer
overall
a
simply
amazing
sour
that
tops
the
scale
in
my
opinion
very
light
and
easy
drinking
yet
highly
flavorful
and
packs
a
good
wallop
a
must
try
for
any
sour
nut
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
full
drinkabilitybis
very
high
a
truly
great
beer
overall
a
really
affordable
and
light
sour
that
offers
a
lot
of
flavor
nothing
about
it
stands
out
particularly
and
it
is
definitely
not
that
complex
really
nice
starter
sour
with
some
nice
flavors
would
drink
again
but
not
really
that
memorable
odi
sat
looking
at
their
petrus
oud
bruin
and
this
beer
side
by
side
in
the
store
i
picked
the
petrus
oud
bruin
before
this
bad
choice
bro
this
is
a
far
superior
brew
sour
complex
and
relatively
easy
on
the
wallet
wait
this
is
the
same
style
of
beer
as
their
oud
brune
this
one
is
better
guy
overall
this
is
the
champagne
of
beer
i
know
high
life
claims
that
but
this
looks
and
feels
like
a
champagne
to
me
while
maintaining
a
superior
beer
flavor
this
will
most
likely
become
a
staple
of
my
fridge
as
an
affordable
shower
simply
delicious
the
balance
here
is
absolutely
outstanding
as
two
rather
bold
and
disparate
elements
meld
almost
seamlessly
i
had
a
difficult
time
dissecting
this
beer
because
the
flavor
is
so
cohesive
the
fact
that
an
oakaged
sour
ale
can
be
so
eminently
drinkable
is
impressive
this
aged
pale
is
flavorful
balanced
and
has
an
admirable
staying
power
all
of
which
have
earned
this
beer
a
place
among
my
all
time
favorites
its
also
the
first
great
beer
i
can
remember
trying
long
before
i
knew
anything
about
what
great
beer
really
is
o
decent
flanders
brown
not
overly
impressed
but
not
bad
m
medium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
lightness
from
wood
aging
o
this
tastes
like
how
the
style
is
described
but
it
just
isnt
for
me
ill
give
another
one
a
try
at
some
point
but
i
wont
be
seeking
one
of
these
out
again
soon
o
a
nice
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
description
i
thought
this
would
be
a
hoppy
pale
ale
with
some
aged
beer
characteristics
in
reality
i
got
no
hint
of
wood
aging
and
no
malt
to
balance
the
wild
yeast
fermentation
flavors
it
is
much
more
sour
than
i
was
expecting
but
now
that
i
know
i
can
appreciate
its
oud
gueuzelike
character
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
sour
but
its
for
sure
not
overwhelming
like
i
was
hoping
i
prefer
my
sours
to
be
pretty
intense
but
this
is
nice
for
just
sitting
around
and
not
getting
that
intenseness
overall
as
an
introductory
sour
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
and
i
should
know
i
am
a
beginner
to
the
style
it
is
not
so
sour
as
to
render
it
undrinkable
or
to
shock
the
taster
but
it
is
sour
enough
to
recall
what
is
so
appealing
about
sourness
in
the
first
place
as
the
beer
warms
the
oak
comes
out
a
lot
more
and
adds
some
much
needed
complexity
that
i
noted
as
lacking
i
would
not
say
i
am
hooked
on
sours
yet
but
this
definitely
intrigued
me
further
a
word
of
warning
probably
regarding
all
sours
though
the
abv
is
relatively
low
and
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
probably
still
a
sipper
as
the
sour
flavors
can
be
overpowering
both
to
the
palate
and
the
stomach
if
ingested
too
quickly

mouthfeel
everyone
keeps
mentioning
is

lacked

quite

but
in
a

way
lots
of
sour
fruit

one
of
my
favorite
sours
and
an
awesome
example
of
creativity
in
traditional
styles
poured
from
an
11
2oz
glass
into
a
goblet
the
pour
is
lively
with
plenty
of
carbonation
almost
champagnelike
aroma
is
of
unripe
fruits
cherry
apple
some
grape
not
much
in
the
aroma
in
terms
of
the
oak
casks
although
i
did
get
some
vanilla
in
there
taste
is
quite
sour
particularly
on
the
front
end
some
more
balanced
sweetness
comes
out
in
the
finish
light
mouthfeel
really
like
a
sparkling
wine
almost
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
its
worth
a
try
clear
golden
color
with
some
scant
wisps
of
cream
above
acidic
sour
fruity
aromas
notes
of
apple
grape
citrus
and
some
of
that
barnyard
funk
flavors
of
sour
tart
fruit
met
with
a
gentle
sweetness
lactic
acid
grape
cherry
and
light
citrus
not
much
character
from
the
wood
from
what
i
can
tell
dry
mediumlight
bodied
not
sure
about
the
oud
bruin
classification
though
i
understand
this
is
the
mother
beer
used
to
blend
other
petrus
beers
regardless
this
is
tasty
sour
stuff
poor
petrus
aged
pale
this
beer
resides
in
a
sad
equilibrium
not
extreme
enough
for
the
hardcore
sour
lovers
but
far
too
sour
for
the
casual
beer
fan
looking
for
something
new
those
of
us
looking
for
a
great
expertly
crafted
sour
will
find
plenty
of
to
love
here
petrus
aged
pale
pours
out
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
tart
and
vinous
with
some
oak
and
cherry
rounding
everything
out
the
taste
is
excellent
its
tart
and
sharp
at
first
with
a
great
apple
and
cherry
bite
its
very
acidic
for
sure
but
doesnt
come
off
as
being
too
far
down
that
line
id
like
to
credit
that
to
the
oakaging
taking
a
bit
of
the
bite
off
with
just
a
small
contribution
to
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
highly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
excellent
overall
a
superb
sour
beer
thats
readily
available
and
accessible
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
comes
across
more
as
a
tart
white
wine
than
a
beer
i
enjoyed
it
but
in
the
end
the
flavor
left
me
wanting
something
more
its
definitely
worth
a
try
nonetheless
possibly
one
of
the
best
sour
beers
ive
tried
beautiful
color
and
carbination
for
such
an
easy
to
drink
sour
excited
its
about
7
5
for
being
labeled
oak
aged
i
didnt
pick
up
that
note
perhaps
because
of
the
sourness
being
so
powerful
i
do
wish
this
beer
was
more
accessible
to
get
o
nice
sourness
good
flavor
and
not
as
overly
sweet
as
some
examples
excellent
balance
of
sourness
in
place
of
bitterness
with
the
residual
sweetness
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
overall
i
like
it
and
would
get
it
again
possibly
although
i
prefer
rodenbach
grand
cru
and
there
are
a
ton
of
other
sours
i
want
to
try
before
i
will
feel
a
need
to
revisit
poured
a
day
after
its
bestby
date
sorry
but
it
does
purport
to
be
aged
into
a
tulip
glass
which
turned
into
a
gorgeous
amber
globe
unsedimented
translucent
liquid
under
just
a
scrim
of
ivory
lace
the
smell
reached
me
immediately
well
before
lifting
glass
to
nose
sawdust
as
if
from
sandalwood
or
some
other
aromatic
specimen
and
on
further
study
spice
aromas
orange
blossom
vegetalchocolate
notes
some
toast
it
would
be
top
score
if
only
if
it
were
a
bit
stronger
dryness
and
astringency
rush
in
with
the
taste
giving
much
more
feel
before
flavors
emerge
those
are
of
a
subtle
sweetness
of
citrus
and
yellow
fruits
a
bit
of
cinnamon
toast
id
love
to
try
this
with
some
spicy
food
a
soft
cheese
lots
of
different
possibilities
o
sour
fan
nirvana
this
is
a
clean
and
intense
sour
beer
with
an
awesome
aroma
i
havent
had
a
more
sour
beer
that
this
and
im
loving
it
oi
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
this
was
a
unique
complex
and
drinkable
sour
beer
that
didnt
just
pucker
up
with
the
usual
cherry
flavors
ask
me
after
i
have
another
bottle
if
i
still
enjoy
the
strange
buttery
finish
but
for
now
bravo
happy
to
bring
one
of
these
home
from
deciccos
in
brewster
ny
this
sour
brew
is
a
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
decent
white
film
on
top
and
nice
random
lacing
the
aroma
brings
granny
apple
sweet
and
sour
with
slight
fermentation
and
juniper
evident
the
flavor
pretty
much
zeros
out
with
sour
apple
and
lemon
lime
bite
over
a
struggling
biscuit
theres
some
doughy
yeast
of
course
over
thin
sharp
carbonation
in
this
light
bodied
tingly
brew
beautiful
o
this
is
actually
a
nice
brew
i
usually
dont
care
for
oud
bruins
because
they
are
to
acetic
for
me
this
is
an
exception
a
nice
mix
of
acetic
and
lactic
to
make
a
balanced
tasty
sour
overall
im
not
sorry
i
tried
it
well
maybe
sausage
for
dinner
a
few
hours
ago
was
a
bad
pairing
i
deserve
the
heartburn
but
i
probably
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
its
certainly
complex
and
i
enjoy
the
bold
flavor
but
its
simply
too
acidic
and
somehow
cloying
at
the
same
time
for
me
to
want
to
spend
over
25oz
on
the
other
hand
it
kind
of
reminds
me
of
warhead
sour
candy
which
is
something
o
a
pretty
good
sour
it
was
a
tad
too
acidic
for
me
but
the
flavor
of
the
cherries
and
woody
ale
like
finish
were
a
delight
to
drink
not
for
everyone
but
a
must
for
those
that
like
sours
or
like
to
try
various
types
o
good
example
of
the
style
and
farily
easy
to
get
d
extremely
drinkable
o
tart
and
crisp
one
beer
that
i
prefer
to
have
cold
to
reduce
the
puckering
tartness
a
enjoyable
sipper
that
i
wouldnt
wan
to
have
too
many
of
due
to
the
price
and
availability
i
probably
will
not
have
this
too
often
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
normal
beer
that
i
drink
cheers
a
very
enjoyable
surprise
i
would
love
to
have
this
one
again
overall
really
overboard
sour
to
the
point
to
were
only
sour
fans
should
try
the
oak
flavor
sneaks
in
at
the
finish
but
relaly
this
is
striaght
up
vinegar
sour
no
balance
no
spices
or
sweet
fruits
only
for
sour
fans
added
later
drinking
this
again
a
special
thought
came
to
my
mind
summerss
eve
yes
it
does
but
i
still
love
this
brew
vaginal
connotations
not
withstanding
certainly
a
unique
drink
give
it
a
go
if
you
see
it
on
the
shelves
this
is
more
sour
than
some
beers
that
are
explicitly
advertized
as
sour
seriously
this
is
intensely
tart
and
sour
not
for
anyone
afraid
of
sour
overall
odd
incredibly
odd
drink
it
this
is
an
awesome
beer
its
complex
flavorful
and
refreshing
its
like
a
cross
between
a
geuze
and
a
triple
a
must
try
for
fans
of
sour
beers
o
i
rarely
associate
a
beers
smell
with
a
place
or
event
but
this
one
does
it
spot
on
for
me
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sourstyles
you
get
a
bit
of
the
wood
flavor
from
the
cask
along
with
a
nice
sour
citrus
tang
and
biscuit
malt
the
aftertaste
leaves
a
muted
sour
tang
and
a
little
of
the
wood
flavor
it
is
a
surprisingly
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
for
such
a
strong
flavor
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
no
alcohol
flavors

its
just
that
nothing
stands
out
its
a
sipper
of
a
sour
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
light
body
and
moderately
carbonated
because
of
the
complexity
of
the
smell
and
flavor
and
the
tartness
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
slowly
for
sure
i
might
buy
one
to
see
how
it
ages
one
finger
white
head
pretty
quick
dissipation
resulting
in
thin
broken
layer
with
ring
around
edge
of
glass
opening
resulted
in
numerous
streams
of
uprising
carbonation
that
quickly
subsided
resulting
in
medium
amber
hazy
body
and
several
streams
rising
up
near
sides
of
glass
imo
a
bit
light
colorwise
for
style
not
sure
this
fits
into
oud
bruin
category
more
of
a
gone
to
funk
belgian
pale
funky
nose
certainly
indicative
of
the
sourness
to
come
a
bit
of
light
horseblanket
and
some
grassiness
taste
is
sour
forward
balanced
by
some
tartness
on
the
backend
peach
sweet
tarts
floral
hops
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
light
side
thinnish
decent

finsih
is
not

astringent
interesting
wonder
how
this
would
stand
up
to
some
cellaring
interesting
but
certainly
not
for
the
sour
mewbie
pretty
aggressive
sourwise
overall
ok
ill
try
anything
but
will
stick
with
the
monks
for
now
i
was
at
the
trappist
and
my
friend
wanted
to
try
petrus
which
i
hadnt
heard
of
before
when
the
bartender
said
that
the
petrus
aged
pale
was
made
for
michael
jackson
i
stopped
him
in
his
tracks
and
asked
him
to
retrieve
a
bottle
for
us
while
he
was
pouring
it
for
us
he
explained
that
bavik
approached
mj
himself
to
ask
what
type
of
beer
he
would
like
them
to
make
when
he
asked
for
a
flanders
pale
petrus
was
confused
how
would
one
make
such
a
thing
they
put
their
heads
together
and
made
it
happen
the
back
story
surely
changed
my
expectations
of
the
beer
but
despite
this
i
feel
i
can
look
past
it
and
say
with
certainty
that
this
is
a
great
beer
the
only
flaw
i
feel
worth
mentioning
is
that
the
taste
profile
is
a
bit
thin
and
fleeting
still
this
is
a
complex
beer
showing
all
the
colors
in
the
thin
spectrum
of
flavors
it
illuminates
not
something
youd
want
any
given
day
of
the
week
this
is
a
special
beer
for
a
special
occasion
our
occasion
was
a
saturday
night
when
you
find
your
occasion
seek
this
beer
out
and
enjoy
o
a
pleasant
enjoyable
sour
beer
that
is
available
at
an
accessible
price
poured
into
jolly
pumpkin
snifter
thin
head
copperish
amber
color
smells
like
whaaaa
sour
funk
amazingly
complex
taste
oh
the
taste
lots
and
lots
of
warheadesque
lemonadey
citrusy
mouthpuckering
action
carbonation
is
light
to
moderate
and
fitting
not
a
strong
malt
or
hops
profile
this
beer
is
very
complex
without
it
is
this
the
most
sour
beer
that
ive
had
maybe
a
nice
golden
color
with
light
fingers
and
a
low
head
citrus
aroma
with
hints
of
green
apples
tangerine
pleasant
to
smell
tart
and
sour
at
first
but
thins
out
to
slightly
sour
pale
which
is
enjoyable
spritzy
on
the
tongue
at
first
bouncing
around
the
cheek
and
mouth
a
good
beer
overall
edit
had
years
later
and
the
aroma
nowhere
near
matches
the
flavor
but
its
a
pretty
potent
sour
character
popped
this
lively
corked
and
caged
bottle
with
a
bit
of
an
expectation
that
was
met
on
those
its
all
funky
making
me
think
it
wouldnt
be
as
sour
as
it
is
the
nose
did
not
prepapre
for
the
lock
jaw
sour
from
the
beginning
of
the
sip
to
well
past
the
finish
i
dont
pick
up
any
vanilla
or
even
that
much
sweetness
this
almost
perfect
the
way
it
is
its
a
very
light
gold
in
appearance
with
very
minimal
head
the
clarity
on
this
beer
is
amazing
the
mouthfeel
is
full
of
vibrant
acidity
and
carbonantion
it
has
a
very
dry
finish
and
strong
pucker
overall
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
and
a
very
affordable
price
9
for
750ml
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
regular
beer
in
my
lineup
this
is
my
first
sour
and
im
not
sure
its
really
for
me
its
not
bad
and
its
certainly
drinkable
but
its
maybe
just
a
little
bit
too
much
on
the
sour
side
for
my
taste
buds
it
would
probably
be
exceptional
to
me
with
just
a
touch
more
balancing
sweetness
pours
a
hazy
light
honey
orange
with
a
large
3
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
random
chunks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
tart
sour
and
funky
with
a
slight
metallic
aroma
taste
is
of
sourtart
fruit
up
front
with
a
malt
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
slightly
acidic
mouthfeel
very
bubbly
but
it
works
with
the
flavors
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
tart
flavors
but
its
a
bit
pricey
at
4
50
for
less
than
12
ounces
pours
a
translucent
gold
with
about
an
inch
of
foamy
pure
white
head
the
bubbles
dissipate
quickly
leaving
small
patches
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
tart
fruits
specifically
apple
lending
a
ciderlike
scent
a
bit
of
funky
yeast
is
mixed
in
with
light
grains
straw
hay
some
wheat
and
it
finishes
with
a
vague
hint
of
wood
it
tastes
of
tart
apple
some
pear
the
muddled
grains
some
lemon
citrus
and
a
dry
oaken
finish
the
barrel
makes
is
presence
known
towards
the
end
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
finishes
rather
dry
from
the
acidity
and
seemingly
the
barrel
treatment
overall
an
enjoyable
offering
but
not
one
im
too
likely
to
pick
up
again
at
411
2
oz
o
though
not
overwhelming
in
its
tartness
this
is
definitely
a
sipper
overall
its
not
bad
begs
in
my
opinion
to
be
paired
with
a
creamy
brie
cheese
not
my
favorite
style
o
nice
overall
easy
drinkability
good
price
point
lacks
the
complexity
of
the
top
examples
of
the
style
overall
an
interesting
beer
not
much
of
a
malt
action
on
this
though
high
abv
is
well
masked
and
hidden
skål
o
a
brilliant
beer
at
a
brilliant
pricepoint
i
could
put
pint
after
pint
of
this
back
oh
wait
thats
what
were
doing
here
note
this
beer
is
even
better
in
the
750
corked
and
caged
format
i
find
the
dryness
sourness
and
lactic
close
tend
to
be
much
stronger
in
that
format
or
on
tap
if
you
ever
see
it
it
can
be
super
biting
when
fresh
on
tap
o
nice
level
of
sourness
very
enjoyable
o
i
think
evan
made
a
great
choice
hefty
pricetag
though
at
4
97
a
bottle
fabulous
worth
experiencing
o
an
enjoyable
oud
bruin
if
not
as
good
or
complex
as
the
best
of
the
style
still
i
would
have
this
again
i
really
like
it
its
dry
and
unrelenting
but
balanced
and
somehow
subtle
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
not
a
single
thing
bad
with
this
one
will
be
buying
again
and
soon
overall
a
solid
flanders
that
really
showcases
the
sour
not
so
much
the
rich
malt
a
pale
flanders
i
like
it
not
really
for
the
beginer
sour
drinker
i
think
most
would
be
turned
off
but
intense
sour
and
nice
levels
of
funk
make
this
a
winner
for
me
i
think
the
sour
quality
of
this
beer
will
blow
a
lot
of
people
away
if
they
just
buy
this
cold
off
the
shelf
give
this
one
some
thought
and
really
put
yourself
to
task
when
drinking
this
beer
it
is
very
complex
and
subtle
if
you
dont
sip
this
one
youre
missing
out
very
interesting
not
as
oaky
as
expected
a
definite
sipper
overall
wow
the
flavor
on
this
monster
is
insanely
overpowering
a
solid
beer
overall
much
more
toned
down
with
less
vinegar
and
acidity
than
a
lot
of
other
beers
of
the
same
style
worth
a
try
mf
nice
moderate
body
a
nice
dry
finish
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
almost
everyday
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
to
mild
carbonation
solid
overall
i
have
a
bit
of
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
as
its
the
one
that
first
got
me
into
sours
still
very
good
and
ill
pick
it
up
when
i
see
it
this
beer
is
an
awesome
sour
fix
at
a
reasonable
price
it
isnt
my
favorite
but
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
i
try
to
keep
one
around
at
all
times
a
good
take
on
the
style
not
quite
a
puckery
or
deep
as
others
of
this
ilk
but
still
a
recommended
ould
bruin
to
me
pours
an
awesome

amazing

not
super
smooth

balanced
but
very
nice
just
dont
get
your
nose
too
close
taste
is
really
good
funk
some
fruit
vinegar
oak
nice
tart
aftertaste
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
definitely
has
an
acidity
to
it
on
the
initial
taste
quickly
disappears
in
the
aftertaste
light
to
medium
feel
with
high
carbonation
and
some
tartness
overall
this
is
a
good
solid
brew
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
i
would
really
like
to
get
a
few
more
and
age
the
brews
1
or
2
years
this
is
a
great
beverage
and
i
look
forward
to
getting
my
hands
on
a
few
more
thank
you
bottle
stop
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
beer
but
its
not
the
best
sour
ive
ever
had
as
the
balance
just
felt
a
bit
off
for
me
then
again
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
of
beer
so
be
sure
to
go
grab
one
to
try
for
yourself
cheers
pours
a
golden
orange
with
bright
carbonation
that
slowly
settles
the
aroma
is
very
funky
of
sour
fruit
yeast
and
a
light
vinegar
at
the
end
ah
the
taste
the
sour
apple
is
very
forward
in
the
beginning
then
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
mostly
sour
there
is
a
bit
of
that
aged
flavor
in
there
that
gives
a
bit
of
that
musty
flavor
and
the
carbonation
really
opens
this
up
this
is
way
to
drinkable
and
very
very
enjoyable
not
sure
why
it
took
me
so
long
to
pick
one
of
these
up
very
good
love
the
sour
and
the
overall
balance
of
this
one
champagne
like
character
present
with
a
high
dose
of
carbonation
mild
hops
huge
oaked
pinot
grigio
after
20
months
in
oak
barrels
that
is
what
i
expect
though
fucking
smooth
prickly
on
the
tongue
sour
in
the
jaws
light
body
refreshing
different
i
really
like
it
this
is
my
first
flanders
oud
bruin
so
i
dont
know
how
it
stacks
up
to
the
style
but
it
works
on
my
palate
3
99
for
a
11
2
oz
bottle
from
total
wine
more
was
it
worth
the
money
yeah
to
try
once
have
every
now
and
then
o
very
very
well
crafted
but
to
meet
the
middle
of
the
road
this
is
my
second
time
reviewing
this
beer
and
i
held
off
inscribing
this
because
it
wasnt
up
to
the
standard
indicated
by
previous
reviews
now
i
can
say
i
gave
some
extra
time
to
this
one
overall
close
to
really
excellent
the
flavor
is
just
too
much
of
sourness
and
tannins
without
enough
else
happening
tasty
and
refreshing
though
i
quite
like
it
enjoy
every
sip
this
is
one
superb
beer
will
be
going
back
for
more
of
this
one
overall
a
very
nice
surprise
did
not
expect
the
complexity
on
the
finish
and
the
substantial
sour
notes
are
quite
appealing
o
overall
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
brew
with
a
great
sourness
level
but
a
bit
more
non
sour
characters
to
balance
would
have
made
it
better
the
body
is
medium
with
strong
acidic
tones
overall
this
is
an
extremely
solid
beer
that
deserves
a
chance
in
everyones
glass
overall
fantastic
value
tasty
sour
beer
at
a
great
price
its
difficult
to
review
a
beer
when
the
style
itself
is
unappealing
to
you
but
you
still
recognize
fine
attributes
in
the
beer
to
me
im
believing
the
look
and
smell
beat
average
for
a
sour
beer
but
the
taste
primarily
just
brought
sour
and
also
the
barrel
aging
didnt
contribute
much
moderate
citrus
and
funk
with
some
sticky
sweetness
an
okay
mass
produced
sour
ale
that
is
a
good
table
beer
for
a
meal
cheap
and
readily
available
but
not
too
authentic
or
sophisticated
o
loved
this
beer
and
will
definitely
have
again
the
tartness
is
great
and
the
sugars
are
not
too
present
which
really
gives
this
brew
something
special
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
sour
musty
funk
and
horse
blanket
in
the
taste
a
sharp
sour
bite
like
a
more
characterful
lemon
rind
wild
yeasts
doing
their
job
well
bitter
sour
and
funky
small
touch
of
oak
but
mainly
a
dry
sour
mouthfeel
is
light
well
carbonated
and
dry
overall
this
is
an
intense
brew
that
i
quite
enjoyed
o
really
nice
beer
good
price
for
a
sour
fix
the
beer
is
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
a
big
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
mostly
white
grape
and
green
apple
skin
and
it
has
just
a
slight
funk
when
you
take
a
sip
you
first
experience
a
mouth
puckering
tartness
similar
to
a
sour
white
wine
you
can
also
taste
fresh
apple
and
vinegar
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
sour
beer
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
new
belgiums
le
terroir
o
good
beer
complex
very
refreshing
enough
alcohol
but
not
too
much
ill
have
this
one
again
this
is
one
my
favorite
underrated
beers
out
there
it
satisfies
my
craving
for
a
complex
funky
beer
without
being
prohibitively
expensive
overall
i
really
liked
it
it
wasnt
bangyouoverthehead
sour
but
well
balanced
id
definitely
drink
it
again
if
i
see
it
it
tastes
quite
a
bit
like
duchesse
de
bourgone
but
looks
nothing
like
it
it
has
more
oak
to
it
and
is
a
little
less
sweet
unless
youve
had
sour
ales
and
have
gotten
used
to
their
taste
i
dont
recommend
this
one
it
would
prove
unpalatable
to
the
novice
enthusiasts
however
will
no
doubt
find
this
a
stellar
example
of
the
style
clear
golden
amber
hue
with
foamy
white
head
light
bodied
with
good
upfront
sour
taste
but
quick
dissipation
into
a
faintly
sweet
aftertaste
a
good
beginning
beer
for
those
not
too
immersed
in
the
world
of
sour
beers
it
has
good
mouthpucker
but
nothing
too
offensive
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
but
i
think
it
could
be
better
for
me
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectation
o
i
surprised
myself
in
the
fact
that
i
really
enjoyed
having
this
it
really
hits
the
spot
when
sitting
on
the
patio
during
a
very
warm
afternoon
i
also
find
that
as
it
warms
up
a
couple
degrees
from
when
first
taken
out
of
the
fridge
it
mellows
out
further
add
to
this
the
fact
that
the
funk
really
hides
the
alcohol
well
id
never
know
that
this
was
7
5
still
not
a
beer
for
just
anyone
to
try
if
this
is
what
a
true
oud
bruin
is
supposed
to
be
im
sold
ill
buy
this
again
for
sure
i
had
this
one
on
tap
yesterday
evening
at
uptown
brothers
brewing
on
colfax
poured
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
funky
on
the
nose
with
aromas
of
vinuous
wood
apples
and
pears
on
the
palate
this
one
was
light
bodied
with
flavors
of
wine
oak
apples
and
pears
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
this
is
your
style
its
a
musttry
for
sure
apparently
this
is
what
pale
ales
tasted
like
centuries
ago
while
i
can
only
speculate
on
the
validity
of
that
claim
i
can
assure
you
thats
is
what
more
beers
made
in
this
century
should
be
tasting
like
the
combination
of
tart
and
sweet
is
delightful
and
while
others
have
likened
it
a
wine
i
say
its
definitively
beer
and
really
good
beer
at
that
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
good
beer
but
if
you
dont
like
sour
stay
away
this
is
the
first
ive
reviewed
this
but
not
the
first
ive
had
it
ill
have
many
more
of
these
in
the
future
o
a
very
enjoyable
brew
that
was
personally
recommended
by
chris
lively
my
experience
with
petrus
isnt
so
good
so
i
wouldnt
have
ordered
this
otherwise
much
better
ontap
then
out
of
the
bottle
by
a
long
shot
enjoyable
thanks
chris
transparent
color
as
a
pilsener
and
with
oxidation
as
powerful
and
strong
small
clouds
of
white
wine
and
reminiscence
of
caves
mouth
tastes
like
sherry
and
muscatel
dry
but
still
with
the
force
of
an
oud
bruin
and
sharp
acidity
with
small
hints
of
oak
that
adds
complexity
to
the
mix
without
making
excessive
acid
is
fleetingly
think
of
a
good
lambic
the
abv
is
not
readily
detectable
excellent
to
quench
his
thirst
and
to
get
unique
flavors
certainly
both
of
oud
bruin
bavik
products
are
good
not
perfect
but
certainly
very
significant
beware
this
beer
is
very
sour
if
you
dont
like
sour
stuff
stay
away
o
awesome
buy
it
if
you
can
find
it
highly
recommended
petrus
aged
pale
pours
a
mildly
hazy
tangerine
nearly
two
fingers
of
cream
colored
head
sprout
up
initially
but
soon
fizz
away
without
putting
up
much
of
a
fight
the
smell
is
fairly
tart
but
with
a
sweet
pale
fruit
component
to
it
as
well
the
flavor
adds
more
layers
to
that
base
giving
the
beer
more
of
a
refined
edge
a
sharp
tartness
is
definitely
what
jumps
out
right
from
the
first
sip
once
my
palate
was
acclimated
to
the
acidity
though
the
rest
of
the
beer
began
to
really
shine
through
green
apple
skin
and
peaches
provide
a
sweetness
that
helps
counteract
the
beers
dominant
sour
characteristic
the
back
end
of
each
sip
highlights
a
delicate
oakcherry
pit
note
that
really
elevates
the
beer
the
body
is
appropriately
light
for
a
relatively
small
sour
beer
and
the
carbonation
serves
its
purpose
of
preventing
the
beer
from
turning
into
a
syrup
and
nothing
more
i
havent
had
petrus
oude
bruin
but
if
the
final
beer
is
as
good
as
this
thread
that
goes
into
it
is
ill
be
in
for
a
hell
of
a
brew
since
my
beer
no
head
with
minimal
lacing
i
will
try
another
once
i
have
the
chance
but
taste
wise
my
beer
tasted
fresh
o
not
too
bad
i
only
say
that
cause
it
takes
a
little
more
character
and
definition
for
a
sour
to
really
wow
me
it
would
be
a
great
start
to
someone
who
has
never
ventured
into
this
type
of
brew
at
least
to
get
an
idea
of
what
a
sour
be
is
like
pours
a
clear
goldenapricot
color
with
a
short
white
head
and
some
nice
spotty
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
a
bit
of
green
apple
and
hay
along
with
a
good
amount
of
funk
light
funk
but
good
in
terms
of
how
forward
the
beer
was
with
it
the
flavor
brought
some
acidity
and
apple
skin
golden
color
was
the
first
hint
that
this
isnt
really
an
oud
bruin
and
the
flavor
is
another
bright
acidity
and
some
light
stone
fruits
this
was
a
really
interesting
beer
and
id
certainly
have
it
again
mouthfeel
light
body
good
carbonation
sessionable
o
excellent
beer
this
is
my
first
sour
beer
but
i
loved
it
and
i
will
be
back
for
more
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
an
oud
bruin
at
all
im
no
expert
but
this
is
too
light
and
has
a
different
sort
of
sour
to
it
i
really
like
it
but
i
dont
know
about
the
category
pours
a
slightly
hazy
copper
color
with
a
tight
soapy
head
and
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
sour
cherries
oak
notes
and
some
green
apples
the
taste
has
a
big
sour
apple
flavor
with
hints
of
sour
cherries
and
a
hint
of
citrus
the
oakiness
of
the
barrels
is
presebt
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
very
good
beer
a
light
very
easy
drink
the
flavor
is
nice
and
smooth
and
makes
you
want
more
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
some
phenols
in
the
aroma
along
with
sour
apple
and
citrus
light
toasted
malts
in
the
taste
quickly
overcome
by
sour
apple
lemonade
orange
zest
and
sour
cherries
finishes
with
a
bitter
funky
dryness
medium
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
unless
you
dont
like
sour
ales
10
oz
pour

redmond
wa
on

no
haziness
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
at
the
finish
bandaid
and
bubblegum
flavor
characteristics
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
flies
under
the
radar
since
it
is
readily
available
but
it
is
really
damn
good
definitely
going
to
have
to
pick
up
some
more
o
at
the
pricepoint
it
is
hard
to
beat
nice
everyday
oud
bruin
it
is
delicious
and
cheap
thats
winwin
i
think
this
would
be
a
really
good
beer
for
friends
that
are
really
into
wine
while
a
bit
of
a
palate
gobsmack
up
front
this
settles
nicely
into
a
pleasantly
sour
fruity
and
proper
woodaged
belgian
ale
the
elevated
booze
playing
nicely
in
the
corner
and
most
memories
of
sidelong
vinegar
references
cast
away
sorry
mom
welcome
to
the
new
world
of
old
world
brewing
techniques
a
nice
refreshing
mildly
sour
beer
everything
about
it
is
good
no
real
downsides
in
my
opinion
but
nothing
really
amazing
about
it
either
a
tasty
enjoyable
beer
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
especially
at
the
cost
really
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
definitely
worth
a
try
d
really
loving
this
beer
right
now
great
easy
drinking
sour
i
could
see
myself
going
through
a
case
of
this
during
the
summer
well
done
only
had
a
2
or
3oz
sample
of
this
one
but
that
was
plenty
for
me
to
get
the
point
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
pleasing
looking
pale
ale
with
a
nice
looking
head
on
it
the
beer
smells
so
strong
with
sour
aromas
rising
i
was
pretty
surprised
this
beers
flavor
could
make
just
about
anyone
pucker
i
think
i
was
still
trying
to
figure
out
how
this
was
still
considered
a
pale
ale
and
not
something
else
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
smooth
but
also
dry
and
tart
an
interesting
ride
for
someone
who
wants
to
try
it
a
great
sour
beer
for
the
price
for
such
a
sour
complex
beer
it
is
amazingly
drinkable
drink
and
overall
really
tasty
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
very
enjoyable
the
abv
is
well
hidden
medium
body
a
little
slick
with
a
dry
cidery
finish
shades
of
a
prosecco
nice
and
easy
to
drink
loved
it
overall
outstanding
beer
very
drinkable
the
sourness
is
not
at
all
overpowering
and
you
get
a
very
nice
fruit
flavor
about
the
beer
very
interesting
sour
beer
the
smell
is
almost
funky
lemon
the
look
is
rather
plain
and
you
wouldnt
know
it
is
different
from
a
glass
of
pilsner
except
for
some
soapy
head
that
dissipates
seems
to
be
right
for
the
aged
style
the
taste
is
funky
vinegar
lemonade
with
overtones
of
grain
and
sweetness
if
you
like
sour
beers
this
is
a
nice
subtle
one
amazingly
drinkable
for
its
size
and
heft
and
really
nicely
balanced
this
showcases
some
of
the
magnificent
things
that
the
belgians
do
and
that
the
rest
of
the
world
only
dabbles
with
very
drinkable
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
done
right
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
the
nose
is
very
tart
vinegar
and
green
apple
notes
the
first
sip
is
almost
puckering
then
there
are
sweet
citrus
and
apple
notes
the
oak
lends
an
interesting
note
also
the
finish
is
lingering
tart
the
beer
is
light
and
very
acidic
good
carbonation
an
enjoyable
sour
o
just
a
wacky
beer
all
over
aroma
is
simply
amazing
overall
though
probably
a
little
bit
hardcore
given
the
exceptionally
high
levels
of
carbonation
and
peculiar
combination
of
tastes
overall
i
was
surprised
by
how
peppery
this
is
but
that
seems
to
make
it
more
refreshing
and
appealing
also
despite
the
onslaught
on
the
taste
buds
there
is
still
a
nice
soft
character
beneath
that
really
makes
this
a
fantastic
sipper
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
not
super
complex
but
the
flavors
that
are
there
are
clean
clear
and
well
balanced
the
taste
is
a
smooth
sour
that
isnt
overwhelming
and
is
quite
refreshing
theres
some
citrus
there
and
maybe
some
hay
not
the
most
complex
but
it
is
refreshing
and
inviting
ill
definitely
have
another
and
these
are
quite
affordable
for
decent
sours
drinkability
beyond
the
crackling
acidity
running
its
course
theres
really
not
too
terribly
much
to
this
one
its
fine
but
not
a
favorite
md
it
poured
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
the
beer
lost
it
pretty
quickly
and
made
for
a
pretty
bland
beer
on
my
tongue
the
tartness
and
sourness
didnt
last
long
enough
to
save
this
beer
on
a
positive
note
this
beer
is
worth
a
try
simply
for
its
nose
that
is
the
shinning
aspect
of
this
beer
d
love
it
one
bottle
and
done
type
of
beer
but
have
had
this
more
than
once
and
is
a
go
to
sour
ale
that
i
enjoy
interesting
beer
pale
color
with
you
golden
haze
smelled
of
citris
and
apples
taste
sour
but
not
vinegary
reminded
me
of
granny
smith
apples
without
the
sweetness
not
my
preference
drinkability
unlike
some
sour
beers
i
actually
was
able
to
drink
it
down
for
some
this
will
be
a
hit
wasnt
for
me
i
really
like
the
nose
on
this
one
the
taste
is
not
bad
but
imo
it
could
be
a
little
less
tart
and
more
oakycomplex
drinkability
im
always
amazed
by
the
diversity
present
in
the
differing
style
offerings
to
enjoy
an
oud
bruin
or
a
lambic
is
to
very
much
appreciate
the
many
facets
of
both
beermaking
and
the
enjoyment
of
variety
this
offering
is
indeed
in
the
upper
strata
of
find
offerings
in
the
style
very
drinkable
for
the
style
doesnt
fatigue
the
palate
like
some
do
with
overwhelming
tartness
this
would
be
a
good
brew
to
introduce
someone
to
sours
very
quality
beer
delicious
and
highly
recommended
ive
only
had
a
few
beers
of
the
style
but
this
is
tasty
no
matter
what
style
you
call
it
flavorful
and
intense
but
not
so
crazy
that
it
turns
me
off
overall
a
very
nice
brew
in
th
erealm
of
sours
this
isnt
the
most
over
powering
and
as
such
might
be
a
good
beer
woth
which
to
expand
your
experience
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
i
find
this
concept
pretty
interesting
and
if
i
really
think
about
it
i
havnt
had
too
many
beers
like
this
before
anyway
it
pours
a
golden
pale
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
two
finger
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
rimthe
smells
are
mustinesswhite
grapesa
abit
of
oak
and
some
fruit
punch
aswellit
has
a
rather
sour
puckering
mouthfeel
which
is
quite
light
bodied
and
feels
like
a
nice
wine
with
tastes
of
sour
white
grapesfruit
punchgoosberriesherbal
hops
and
finishes
with
a
ever
so
smooth
tart
champagne
finish
and
overall
this
brew
is
quite
unique
and
even
though
this
one
would
do
me
nicely
for
tonight
i
will
buy
it
again
without
doubt
as
there
aint
too
many
brews
that
taste
like
this
cheers
the
subdued
flavor
makes
this
quite
drinkable
but
im
not
personally
in
love
with
the
taste
or
lack
thereof
enough
to
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
it
in
fairness
its
a
departure
from
my
personal
favorite
styles
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
exceptional
compared
to
similar
brews
notes
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
as
i
hadnt
been
overly
impressed
by
other
petrus
offerings
and
this
is
very
cheap
for
a
sour
imported
from
belgium
i
ended
up
enjoying
this
quite
a
bit
though
great
balance
between
the
tartsour
fruit
and
woodiness
really
pretty
enjoyable
and
given
the
price
i
could
definitely
see
myself
getting
this
again
not
the
best
sour
but
for
the
cost
it
is
definitely
worth
a
look
i
dont
really
see
how
this
is
categorized
an
oude
brun
oh
well
im
gonna
review
it
as
one
poured
into
a
tulip
hazy
amber
with
some
deep
honey
color
sits
under
a
two
finger
rocky
head
this
beer
leaves
behind
some
nice
lacing
vinegar
and
lemon
up
front
following
underneath
there
is
some
horsey
brett
charecter
and
damp
old
wood
aside
from
the
apperance
the
taste
is
where
i
find
the
greatest
departure
from
the
said
style
fairly
zingy
beer
with
a
real
basement
quality
citrus
earthy
hay
and
a
plan
round
malt
body
the
beer
feels
well
balanced
on
my
tongue
and
surprisingly
has
a
long
finish
for
a
beer
of
the
type
i
believe
this
beer
is
delicious
i
truly
enjoyed
it
but
an
oude
brun
no
d
is
very
good
i
found
it
just
right
with
it
sourness
and
just
right
with
malthops
and
wood
flavors
11
2
oz
was
just
the
right
serving
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
but
never
thin
the
carbonation
is
active
and
really
works
well
with
the
beers
overall
character
as
far
as
drinkability
you
have
got
to
be
kidding
me
this
has
beer
pure
beer
drinking
pleasure
d
pretty
interesting
not
familiar
with
this
type
of
beer
but
its
interesting
served
in
a
tulip
pours
a
translucent
straw
gold
with
no
head
and
minimal
lacing
nose
expresses
citrus
french
oak
and
some
toasty
notes
perhaps
a
trace
of
caramel
taste
is
salty
citrusy
and
mellow
wood
notes
with
a
slightly
tart
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
an
astringency
that
keeps
the
salivary
glands
stimulated
a
solid
example
of
the
style
very
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
with
a
wellhidden
abv
especially
nice
in
that
it
is
fairly
easy
to
obtain
drinkabilitythis
is
a
quite
refreshing
sour
beer
its
not
the
most
sour
beer
in
the
world
but
its
got
some
great
flavors
i
cant
believe
its
taken
this
long
to
try
this
beer
ill
certainly
need
to
get
this
more
often
now
a
very
nice
interesting
beer
the
appearance
is
a
nice
strawgold
color
finger
thick
fizzy
off

the
smell
is
lemons

and
a
bit
tropical
the
taste
is
tart
woody
earthy
sweet
and
fruity
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
high
nice
sour
for
someone
who
is
a
bit
new
to
the
style
nicely
drinkable
overall
i
want
another
but
lack
of
balance
and
body
detract
notes
thanks
to
the
guys
at
greenville
beer
exchange
for
the
advice
definitely
the
appearance
of
a
pale
but
the
aroma
and
flavors
of
a
flanders
oud
bruin
overall
really
fun
beer
an
awesome
beer
though
easily
available
i
just
never
seemed
to
find
it
anywhere
even
in
a
bottle
good
stuff
d
a
very
enjoyable
sour
lots
of
tart
apples
in
the
nose
and
taste
would
like
to
have
again
cheers
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
refreshing
and
delicious
i
will
always
have
at
least
3
bottles
in
my
house
at
all
times
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
though
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
very
tart
and
this
beer
is
just
that
d
this
might
be
my
new
go
to
sour
beer
it
is
not
to
hard
on
the
wallet
and
it
is
a
sensational
drink
well
aged
infected
and
brewed
the
balance
is
struck
well
to
make
a
tasty
funky
beer
d
this
is
one
of
the
more
sour
flanders
being
more
sour
that
vinegar
imo
great
flavor
drinkable
body
and
inviting
aroma
one
of
the
better
sours
available
in
my
area
will
definitely
buy
again
d
this
tastes
wonderful
i
wish
i
had
another
in
the
fridge
its
not
too
strong
so
itd
be
easy
to
knock
back
a
few
i
dont
think
the
dryness
would
get
to
me
at
all
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
poured
a
hazy
yelloworange
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
slight
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
tart
sour
and
slight
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
an
excellent
brew
for
the
style
i
have
had
this
more
times
than
i
care
to
remember
and
will
be
having
again
in
the
future
im
sure
just
an
allaround
great
representation
of
the
style
has
a
nice
flavor
and
aroma
here
and
is
a
must
try
for
any
sour
fan
out
there
or
a
fan
of
the
style
the
acidity
level
of
this
beer
is
on
the
higher
side
which
is
the
only
thing
hampering
its
drinkability
overall
i
really
love
this
beer
and
for
6
99
a
750ml
its
a
better
bargain
than
rodenbach
grand
cru
my
benchmark
beer
in
priceavailabilitytaste
very
drinkable
with
a
crisp
sour
finish
golden
brown
in
color
with
patches
of
white
or
offwhite
head
no
head
retention
or
lacing
smells
of
apple
cider
vinegar
fresh
granny
smith
apple
and
a
touch
of
earthy
malt
the
taste
comes
on
quite
tart
with
more
apple
flavor
lots
of
sweetness
comes
through
as
well
very
fruity
and
mostly
clean
tasting
earthy
funky
flavors
are
there
but
are
definitely
in
the
background
mostly
covered
up
by
the
sweetness
and
tartness
from
a
bottle
pours
a
clear
medium
gold
with
a
large
head
nose
is
acidic
light
fruits
sour
oaky
and
sharp
really
reminds
me
of
cable
car
09
in
the
nose
quite
acidic
from
start
to
finish
good
lemon
and
oak
notes
to
this
but
i
find
the
acidity
distracting
straight
and
sharp
without
a
ton
of
complexity
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
nice
sweaty
sock
brett
rounds
it
out
acidity
is
really
quite
high
i
think
even
the
12oz
bottle
might
be
tough
to
finish
although
im
actually
impressed
with
how
fully
sour
and
acidic
this
is
i
was
expecting
something
much
more
mellow
had
this
on
tap
at
fff
followed
by
a
scotch
egg
and
a
brisket
sandwich
first
scent
was
full
of
sourness
and
lemon
upon
the
first
sip
it
simply
exploded
in
my
mouth
with
a
sour
lemon
peel
flavor
continued
taste
of
lemon
lingers
throughout
the
taste
could
drink
this
for
days
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
would
suggest
trying
it
first
review
need
to
do
more
work
mouthfeel
is
nice
medium
texture
and
lightly
carbonated
sticky
sweets
coat
the
palette
do
not
expect
to
drink
this
fast
rather
sip
and
enjoy
the
sour
fruity
flavors
the
body
is
medium
light
and
carbonation
is
a
bit
stinging
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
there
was
that
one
off
flavor
that
brought
the
whole
package
down
from
stellar
to
meehhhh
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
nice
sour
beer
worth
sipping
on
for
a
while
very
strong
sourness
in
the
flavor
as
well
some
sweetness
to
balance
as
well
as
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
really
its
super
funky
lemon
and
minimal
bitterness
almond
pretty
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
stingy
carbonation
that
well
fits
the
tartness
of
the
beer
poured
a
golden
brown
with
a
hint
of
orange
bubbly
head
falling
to
a
thin
layer
nose
is
vinous
vingear
green
apple
and
some
pear
taste
is
quite
sour
less
vinegar
than
the
nose
and
the
green
apple
is
more
evident
here
very
drying
mouthfeel
with
a
definite
pucker
high
carbonation
an
introduction
to
the
style
for
me
and
i
can
definitely
say
that
one
was
enough
interesting
to
say
the
least
although
i
dont
know
how
often
ill
pursue
this
style
i
had
this
down
at
the
falling
rock
taphouse
in
downtown
denver
last
weekend
and
i
have
been
wanting
more
ever
since
served
in
a
wine
glass
this
beer
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
sweet
malts
light
citrus
and
subtrle
hops
taste
wise
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
sours
i
have
had
not
overly
sour
but
definitely
noticable
and
not
as
sweet
and
fruity
as
most
instead
i
found
it
very
well
balanced
between
the
sour
and
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
very
nice
balance
of
sour
tart
and
citrus
fruits
if
youre
looking
for
a
puckerworthy
sour
thats
actually
sessionable
petrus
aged
pale
is
for
you
highly
recommended
great
moderately
high
carbonation
and
light
body
spot
on
estery
fruit
smells
with
some
winey
notes
the
fruit
up
front
gives
way
to
some
oaky
vinous
flavours
the
fairly
high
carbonation
melds
nicely
with
the
sweet
tart
middle
sparkling
wonderfully
light
well
balanced
and
complex
the
sourness
draws
you
in
an
incredably
drinkable
sour
top
shelf
conclusion
this
style
intrigues
me
greatly
and
i
feel
that
there
is
no
way
that
i
can
really
understand
the
intricacies
of
the
style
from
my
limited
exposure
to
it
this
as
far
as
i
can
tell
is
a
very
good
example
as
it
is
complex
and
pleasing
d
very
smooth
and
refreshing
overall
this
was
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
a
solid
beer
that
doesnt
fit
well
into
any
category
but
is
well
worth
a
shot
big
complaint
9

a
draft
d
this
is
an
intriguing
beer
pretty
much
a
pale
oud
bruin
i
expected
more
lactic
acid
but
instead
got
ch3cooh
which
is
fine
i
like
them
both
in
their
own
ways
what
they
can
bring
to
a
beer
really
good
like
the
regular
oud
bruin
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
puckering
sweet
dry
and
bubbly
finish
leaves
your
mouth
like
youve
been
sucking
on
pennies
wouldnt
drink
often
but
still
nice
i
dont
think
id
have
too
many
glasses
of
this
beer
in
a
rowbut
i
feel
that
way
about
a
lot
of
sours
in
this
single
glass
i
find
it
to
be
very
drinkable
i
wont
tire
of
it
before
i
finish
d
very
drinkable
hard
to
believe
the
abv
is
7
3
really
good
stuff
definitely
worth
trying
and
probably
something
ill
come
back
to
for
a
sour
fix
d
this
is
one
really
good
sour
pale
up
there
with
the
best
yet
its
super
accessible
and
really
easy
to
drink
not
to
mention
its
fucking
everywhere
in
philly
right
now
and
has
been
for
awhile
d
this
is
an
oud
bruin
worth
checking
out
i
wasnt
expecting
big
things
after
being
disappointed
by
their
winter
ale
but
this
one
is
a
winner
on
tap
at
trappeze
in
athens
poured
into
a
dupont
tulip
white
head
golden
body
aroma
of
intense
sour
apple
and
grapes
extreme
tartness
mouth
puckering
intensity
champagne
notes
wild
yeasty
funk
and
sour
apples
dominate
the
taste
i
usually
dont
seek
out
the
funk
but
this
is
a
rare
draft
treat
this
beer
was
very
tasty
and
complex
but
way
too
tartsour
to
drink
all
night
interesting
but
low
drinkability
and
certainly
not
a
pale
ale
great
beer
for
a
cider
fan
but
this
is
not
a
typical
beer
yet
still
worth
trying
because
of
the
nice
fruit
taste
combination
d
i
believe
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
easy
drinking
enough
if
you
are
into
sours
im
not
sure
how
many
i
would
want
to
have
in
a
sitting
but
this
is
good
pours
a
very
nice
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
lightly
tart
reminiscent
of
sour
apples
taste
is
lightly
sour
not
overpowering
at
all
thats
not
to
say
this
is
a
wimpy
beer
it
has
plenty
of
complex
flavor
to
offer
nice
mouthfeel
very
crisp
this
is
a
sour
style
beer
that
does
its
thing
elegantly
i
love
all
manner
of
sour
beers
and
i
think
those
who
enjoy
the
style
will
be
satisfied
by
this
one
d
great
for
imbibing
with
food
cleansing
acidity
makes
you
want
more
great
stuff
overall
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
pale
the
tartness
is
quite
forward
but
not
out
of
balance
acidic
and
tart
the
first
taste
is
like
a
punch
in
the
mouth
once
you
are
past
the
initial
sour
shock
and
your
palate
is
coated
the
complex
flavors
start
to
emerge
lots
of
tart
and
slightly
sweet
citrus
fruits
maybe
a
hint
of
tart
apple
as
the
beer
warms
the
woody
flavors
start
to
emerge
maybe
a
hint
of
vanilla
light
bodied
and
very
dry
once
you
get
past
the
initial
sourtart
shock
the
beer
becomes
quite
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these

with
a
touch

transitions
to

and
then
a
slight

subtle
aftertaste
of

slight

to
this

lightmedium
mouthfeel
a
little
pricey
at

bottle
but
pretty
satisfied
with
this
one
d
its
pretty
tasty
but
not
the
smoothest
ride
really
smooth
with
a
perfectly
carbonated
light
to
medium
textured
body
yielding
a
great
texture
i
will
definitely
be
heading
back
for
more
bottles
of
this
this
is
a
great
sour
and
to
be
able
to
buy
it
at
4bottle
is
a
great
treat
d
suprisingly
high
given
its
puckerfactor
i
do
think
the
pale
ale
name
on
the
bottle
is
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
and
may
do
it
a
disservice
lightly
malted
gripping
sourness
on
the
flavor
with
some
tannic
wood
and
tart
fruit
coming
out
i
wish
the
malts
were
a
bit
more
assertive
and
maybe
some
darker
fruit
would
be
nice
it
does
have
a
nice
level
of
sourness
especially
for
the
price
about
3
50
it
can
fix
a
sour
craving
at
the
very
least
pretty
tasty
but
lacks
the
depth
behind
the
sourness
to
really
keep
things
moving
that
said
i
will
most
definitely
buy
a
few
more
of
these
for
the
cellar
its
a
great
value
notes
this
is
a
beer
you
hate
or
love
and
its
a
acquired
taste
but
to
us
sour
lovers
its
heaven
enjoy
served

a
sort
of

golden

than
a

of
this
brew
has
all
the
indications
of
this
being
a
funky
brew
slight
fruity
tones
with
an
indication
of
sourness
the
flavor
of
this
brew
has
a
tartness
upfront
with
fruity
hints
and
vinegar
character
quite
a
bit
of
puckering
power
with
its
sourness
level
light
bodied
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
that
is
prickly
on
the
tongue
lingering
flavor
of
funk
and
an
oaky
woodsiness
left
in
the
mouth
that
exaggerates
the
dryness
of
this
beer
along
with
an
ever
increasing
amount
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
orange

the

the
qualitites
of

the

and
prickly
on

palate
though
slight
lingering
tartness
a
good
beer
that
could
perhaps
use
a
touch
of
mellowing
i
would
consider
it
a
successful
introduction
from
an
enjoyability
standpoint
but
it
being
my
firsti
cant
comment
on
its
trueness
to
the
oud
bruin
style
i
was
actually
kind
of
discouraged
from
trying
this
by
my
bartender
but
i
found
it
delightful
and
my
wifewho
isnt
really
a
fan
of
micros
much
less
strange
sour
beersenjoyed
it
also
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
d
i
could
enjoy
another
one
of
these
for
sure
glad
i
stumbled
upon
it
just
completely
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
a
good
way
pours
a
bright
clear
golden
color
with
a
smaller
than
average
head
that
lasts
as
a
film
for
most
of
the
beer
the
lacing
is
very
nice
and
sticky
as
it
clings
to
the
glass
great
funky
tart
sour
fruit
aroma
first
sip
hits
you
with
that
same
sour
funk
and
then
mellows
out
quite
a
bit
i
got
a
lot
of
sour
applegrapes
mixed
in
with
a
musty
funk
and
acidity
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
to
balance
it
all
through
the
beer
and
a
very
pleasant
dryness
at
the
end
there
is
a
medium
to
light
body
which
is
a
bit
thin
for
an
oud
bruin
however
this
one
is
a
pale
ale
either
way
i
would
have
preferred
more
body
very
refreshing
and
so
easy
to
drink
could
drink
it
all
day
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
with
a
two
finger
white
head
and
a
swirl
of
bubbles
the
smell
is
all
sour
apples
lemons
and
funk
the
taste
is
again
all
sour
not
sure
this
really
qualifies
as
a
pale
ale
but
im
not
complaining
this
really
reminds
me
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
with
less
fruit
and
more
dry
in
the
taste
yum
this
is
going
to
leave
you
puckering
but
if
you
like
sour
beer
then
this
is
one
to
try
taste
is
very
tart
and
sour
its
rich
and
malty
for
being
funky
but
quite
smooth
and
drinkable
for
what
it
is
light
malt
and
light
carb
is
nice
pours
a
clean
pale
yellowish
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
well
like
sticking
your
head
in
a
package
of
sweet
tarts
in
the
taste
sugary
and
liquid
sweet
tarts
yet
more
tart
than
sweet
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
sourness
in
the
aftertaste
super
sour
a
bit
sweet
but
delicious
all
day
long
d
an
awesome
brew
with
great
flavor
and
an
intense
mouthfeel
could
go
back
to
back
with
this
sipper
d
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
perhaps
not
for
the
novice
but
certainly
the
more
adventurous
ba
there
is
some
interesting
flavors
in
this
beer
and
not
quite
like
any
other
beer
ive
tried
i
will
have
another
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
wine
so
that
i
could
more
easily
distinguish
the
characteristic
flavors
that
come
as
a
result
of
the
oak
barrel
aging
beer
is
thin
and
has
a
slightly
metallic
tinge
to
it
strong
acetic
acid
note
almost
cherry
like
at
times
pretty
bright
flavors
good
drinkability
and
nice
mouthfeel
d
if
this
is
a
style
you
really
enjoy
then
more
than
one
makes
sense
for
me
one
is
enough
as
a
real
taste
treat
like
a
rodenbach
grand
cru
overall
very
well
made
and
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
i
will
be
getting
this
again
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
dynamic
with
the
flavors
quickly
evolving
throughout
the
taste
exceptional
to
say
the
least
i
feel
foolish
for
putting
this
back
on
the
shelf
so
many
times
before
d
not
for
everybody
but
if
you
can
hang
with
it
this
is
a
really
great
summertime
refresher
like
a
light
rodenbach
grand
cru
i
tried
this
beer
on
september
2
2009
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
brown
with
a
thin
white
head
that
lasted
the
aroma
is
musty
bread
and
wood
chips
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
light
carbonation
the
taste
was
sour
moreso
than
the
petrus
oud
bruin
in
my
opinion
very
yeasty
in
the
taste
d
quite
drinkable
this
brewery
and
brand
have
been
known
to
produce
some
clunkers
not
this
fine
brew
d
goes
down
very
smooth
and
with
the
tartness
being
kept
to
a
restrained
level
it
would
be
easy
to
put
down
quite
a
few
of
these
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
tart
with
vanilla
and
oak
notes
the
flavor
is
tart
lemons
with
some
oak
the
beer
is
extremely
dry
and
makes
you
keep
drinking
it
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
an
excellent
budget
sour
that
said
and
despite
the
many
likable
qualities
of
this
ale
it
just
doesnt
float
my
boat
seems
lacking
in
character
or
at
least
the
kind
of
character
id
like
to
send
past
my
gums
i
probably
wont
buy
one
again
any
time
soon
but
you
probably
should
d
pretty
easy
drinking
oud
bruin
i
prefer
sour
beers
that
really
make
my
mouth
pucker
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
it
is
real
nice
to
find
a
beer
that
gives
you
a
nice
sour
taste
in
a
smaller
bottle
while
not
an
amazing
beer
this
one
is
pretty
good
and
really
good
considering
the
difficulty
to
find
beers
of
this
style
at
this
price
point
i
would
drink
it
again
i
love
me
some
sour
beers
though
this
is
a
little
one
dimensional
basically
just
tart
and
sour
lemons
not
much
is
going
on
not
something
i
am
going
to
get
again
pours
a
golden
light
brown
color
with
a
tight
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
solid
ring
the
aroma
is
of
the
oak
cask
tart
and
sour
there
is
also
a
sugary
aroma
that
pops
through
clearly
oaked
aged
a
big
lemony
tartsour
flavor
perhaps
too
lemony
as
you
dont
really
pick
up
any
actual
oak
flavors
there
is
a
seltzer
water
type
flavor
as
well
i
guess
what
is
disappointing
is
that
the
rest
of
the
beer
doesnt
show
up
i
would
like
to
see
hints
of
malt
and
yeast
but
all
i
really
pick
up
is
the
sour
there
is
a
very
very
very
light
cider
like
flavor
there
is
a
bitter
aspect
towards
the
finish
kind
of
woody
the
feel
is
light
fizzy
and
puckering
which
is
what
i
would
expect
from
a
sour
again
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
im
not
an
expert
on
this
style
so
not
too
much
to
base
this
beer
on
the
sour
flavors
are
nice
but
to
me
needs
to
have
a
touch
of
other
flavors
as
well
medium
mouthfeel
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
great
sour
in
a
standard
12
oz
bottle
recommended
d
as
a
person
that
likes
tart
and
sour
beer
this
was
a
pleasnt
surprise
after
the
first
sniff
and
beyond
if
sour
beers
are
your
thing
its
worth
picking
some
of
this
up
to
try
drinks
very
well
wild
taste
is
well
managed
and
close
to
being
able
to
drink
more
than
one
pours
a
light
brown
with
about
a
finger
of
head
the
aroma
is
a
slightly
acrid
vinegarlike
smell
the
taste
is
an
amazing
sour
funky
goodness
its
not
the
best
sour
iv
ever
had
but
its
very
close
tomorrow
im
going
to
go
back
to
my
local
beer
shop
and
buy
them
out
of
this
ive
wanted
to
taste
petrus
for
a
really
long
time
apparently
ive
been
missing
out
this
stuff
is
great
md
mouthfeel
was
smooth
for
a
sour
and
went
down
well
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
and
i
may
have
to
hit
the
store
and
pick
up
the
west
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
it
has
an
ok
drinkability
but
i
couldnt
possibly
session
this
one
taste
is
very
sour
with
a
touch
of
apple
tartness
very
dry
body
as
well
very
appropriate
levels
of
sourness
with
some
interesting
fruit
complexity

damn
bavik
i
know
philly
is
mad
lucrative
for
breweries
but
you
guys
must
of
sent
at
least
150
kegs
of
this
stuff
over
here
its
on
at
at
least
25
bars
that
i
know
of
right
now
im
bombared
by
this
goodness
and
im
becoming
broke
because
of
it
please
stop
quite
a
nice
sour
sweetness
is
low
but
still
has
a
hint
very
unbeerlike
which
to
me
is
an
indication
of
a
good
sour
if
that
makes
sense
id
love
to
pair
this
with
some
stinky
cheeses
unfortunately
im
all
out
at
the
moment
very
solid
i
would
never
turn
down
the
chance
to
have
some
d
its
relatively
easy
to
drink
particularly
if
you
like
sourness
but
i
cant
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
d
i
would
think
its
best
served
perhaps
as
an
apertif
before
a
meal
i
wouldnt
think
it
would
go
well
with
most
foods
not
my
favorite
but
its
interesting
to
try
edit
lots
of
sour
yeast
overall
too
tart
for
my
liking
the
petrus
oud
bruin
is
better
mouthfeel
expect
dry
cheeks
constantly
being
washed
by
a
salivating
throat
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
although
it
is
somewhat
sour
it
is
still
refereshing
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
disappointing
bodytoo
light
and
thin
d
for
the
abv
and
strong
flavors
i
notice
my
glass
emptying
faster
than
expected
very
tasty
worth
seeking
out
if
you
need
to
get
your
sour
fix
the
beer
is
on
the
more
acidic
side
and
has
a
tongue
drying
quality
to
it
as
far
as
feel
goes
it
certainly
does
a
good
job
of
blanketing
mouth
throughout
the
experience
the
beer
maintains
its
character
and
the
mouth
drying
aspect
i
believe
adds
to
its
drinkability
overall
very
solid
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
as
light
and
drinkable
as
it
was
would
have
no
issue
with
this
one
again
d
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
definitely
a
sip
and
savor
brew
but
great
flavors
and
mouthfeel
verdict
nicely
complex
and
tasty
throughout
aged
pale
is
a
friendly
and
solid
little
brew
if
youve
only
tried
a
few
sweet
sours
and
are
looking
to
branch
out
into
the
more
vinegary
side
this
would
be
a
perfect
place
to
start
not
the
complex
sour
ive
had
but
still
very
interesting
more
of
a
fruity
sour
than
vinegary
while
still
not
really
being
a
fruity
beer
helps
the
drinkability
still
this
is
meant
to
be
savored
not
drunk
serially
dnice
tart
beer
a
little
bit
much
of
the
fake
sugar
sweetness
would
be
good
for
a
hot
day
taste
is
effervescent
with
a
spritzy
champagne
like
carbonation
bit
of
orange
citrus
conveys
to
a
textured
malty
finish
quite
enjoyable
d
this
is
an
incredibly
delicious
beer
i
cannot
believe
i
have
passed
this
thing
up
at
the
beer
store
so
many
times
d
my
favorite
beer
ever
no
question
about
it
not
hyped
i
dont
care
it
is
the
deal
it
has
all
of
the
characteristics
that
i
prize
in
a
beer
d
this
is
very
drinkable
for
me
i
freaking
love
this
beer
sour
and
complex
without
the
sweet
long
finishing
but
not
long
enough
to
keep
me
from
having
another
sip
d
crisp
refreshing
and
flavorful
m
pretty
decent
a
bit
oily
d
exceedingly
drinkable
if
sourness
is
not
a
turnoff
almost
too
drinkable
as
mentioned
this
would
be
a
near
perfect
venture
into
new
to
me
territory
if
the
flavors
had
been
a
little
more
daring
lovely
golden
honey
colour
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
and
a
copious
amount
of
fine
carbonation
the
aroma
has
a
sour
edge
to
it
with
apples
grapes
and
a
hint
of
cherries
there
are
slightly
sweeter
tone
under
this
with
a
light
toffee
and
some
vanilla
the
taste
starts
off
very
sharp
and
sour
with
lots
of
apples
vinegar
and
a
very
piercing
sherbet
the
finish
is
dry
and
tangy
but
i
was
left
with
a
slightly
buttery
aftertaste
very
active
in
the
palete
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
very
sharp
dry
feel
this
isnt
my
style
but
it
is
a
very
crafted
flanders
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
are
into
them
poured
a
clear
golden
red
body
with
lively
carbonation
for
a
frothy
one
finger
head
and
a
lace
ring
a
funky
yeast
smell
with
some
sour
grapedark
fruit
tart
smell
along
hints
of
some
oakiness
light
bodied
and
smooth
this
beer
flows
easily
over
the
tongue
and
is
real
sharp
thanks
to
lively
carbonation
the
beer
gives
off
sour
fruitness
like
grape
and
cherry
along
with
something
like
figs
and
berries
has
a
good
amount
of
sweetness
as
well
and
then
finishes
dry
thanks
to
some
woodiness
a
little
livelier
than
expected
but
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
petrus
golden
ale
claims
to
be
the
key
to
heaven
jesus
did
give
the
keys
of
heaven
to
peter
so
perhaps
this
ale
represents
salvationi
am
in
liquid
form
first
off
this
is
no
oud
bruin
look
at
it
its
yellow
for
gods
sake
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
pale
yellow
and
looks
like
a
gueuze
it
smells
quite
enticingly
sour
a
little
brett
funkiness
and
a
little
cereal
the
flavor
is
nice
and
sour
but
not
abrasive
tart
and
lemony
this
is
a
good
sour
and
i
cant
believe
ive
passed
it
up
so
many
times
in
the
past
the
price
wasnt
too
bad
for
a
sour
at
5
for
a
330ml
this
is
a
great
beer
that
deserves
alot
more
attention
a
pleasant
suprise
for
any
sour
lover
think
rr
temptation
with
a
little
less
dryness
when
i
saw
pale
on
this
bottle
i
was
a
little
wary
expecting
it
to
be
hoppy
brew
i
was
wrong
it
has
a
sweet
alcoholic
aroma
almost
like
a
fine
bourbon
taste
has
some
apple
notes
and
some
other
sweet
fruits
looks
actually
like
apple
juice
and
it
doesnt
have
an
alcoholic
taste
despite
the
7
3
abv
d
tough
to
drink
many
of
them
12
beers
at
the
most
otherwise
it
can
upset
your
stomach
d
not
my
taste
but
a
decent
example
of
the
style
d
very
very
drinkable
d
this
was
the
first
sour
beer
i
ever
had
about
a
year
ago
and
for
a
sour
patch
kid
junkie
i
fell
in
love
with
the
style
since
then
ive
had
more
robust
and
puckering
beers
but
love
the
drinkability
price
and
availability
of
this
one
d
ehhh
well
like
black
cherry
warheads
you
cant
have
too
much
pours
a
light
orange
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
some
scattered
lace
aroma
is
tart
but
perfumey
once
youre
acclimated
to
the
sour
aspect
lemons
and
bruised
apples
come
through
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
flavor
the
oak
is
subtle
as
is
the
alcohol
but
theyre
apparent
if
you
look
hard
enough
fleeting
licorice
accents
also
some
pepperiness
interesting
and
fairly
complex
but
a
little
thin
in
body
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
sour
beer
i
cant
imagine
having
more
than
one
in
a
session
though
this
poured
a
clear
light
gold
with
some
white
head
it
smelled
like
white
wine
and
vinegar
with
sour
yeast
and
green
apples
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
and
oak
it
tasted
like
champagne
grapes
and
sour
yeast
and
some
green
apple
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
and
oak
it
was
watery
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
had
a
lasting
dry
sour
aftertaste
overall
this
seemed
more
like
champagne
than
beer
but
it
had
an
interesting
and
decent
flavor
the
sour
and
bubbly
character
made
this
a
definite
sipping
beer
but
the
alcohol
was
pretty
well
hidden
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
sour
beers
so
this
was
challenging
for
me
to
drink
but
it
seemed
generally
enjoyable
even
though
its
not
necessarily
refined
or
delicious
overall
i
give
it
a
good
grade
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
solo
without
the
influence
of
spinach
on
my
palate
but
i
can
imagine
the
flavors
and
consistency
improving
i
will
give
this
one
an
update
drinkability
drinks
very
nicely
but
i
think
one
or
two
would
be
enough
ive
got
two
bottles
of
this
the
second
one
i
think
might
be
a
good
candidate
for
cooking
the
bright
acidity
and
slight
fruitiness
might
really
add
some
nice
character
to
a
stew
tomato
sauce
or
something
else
at
3
50ish
not
a
great
price
point
but
definitely
adding
it
to
my
sour
rotation
d
a
sipper
for
sure
very
pleasant
on
a
warm
afternoon
goes
down
easily
but
makes
your
lips
pucker
as
you
drink
but
not
in
a
harsh
uncomfortable
way
could
maybe
drink
two
in
a
sitting
but
it
took
more
more
than
an
hour
to
sip
one
quite
refreshing
and
drinkable
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
up
above
7
like
most
dry
sourswilds
it
isnt
a
bad
one
for
hot
weather
i
could
definitely
get
used
to
having
this
around
this
murky
brown
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
smell
of
slight
bitterness
with
tones
of
sweetness
in
the
after
aroma
the
taste
is
that
of
a
granny
apple
the
tartness
that
it
gives
but
the
sweetness
of
the
aftertaste
overall
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
d
for
a
fairly
intense
brew
with
a
lot
of
funk
and
sourness
going
on
this
is
definitely
more
drinkable
than
others
ive
had
the
mild
sweetness
tempers
some
of
the
sourness
and
the
light
body
helps
everything
go
down
as
well
not
something
id
have
more
than
one
of
but
a
bit
easier
to
drink
than
i
was
expecting
after
reading
others
comments
about
the
levels
of
funk
and
dryness
the
beer
poured
out
a
nice
pale
gold
with
a
few
fingers
of
foamy
head
not
a
lot
going
on
the
nose
some
fruit
some
yeast
but
the
taste
is
amazing
lots
of
sour
tang
it
tastes
more
like
a
basque
cider
than
a
belgian
beer
there
is
fruit
and
citrus
unlike
a
lot
of
the
sour
red
there
is
no
ketchupy
or
bandaid
taste
to
distract
from
the
funky
sourness
its
a
great
beer
with
a
light
mouth
feel
one
of
the
few
sours
i
have
had
where
i
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
night
thin
head
which
quickly
dissolves
down
almost
nothing
the
lacing
is
made
of
very
minute
bubbles
but
lacks
stickiness
burnt
orange
to
copper
in
color
good
clarity
yet
the
intensity
of
the
coloration
gives
it
additional
visual
solidity
sour
lemon
and
orange
citrus
build
first
in
the
nose
cocktail
bitters
sharp
rye
notes
the
brown
sugar
nuances
arent
very
sweet
same
good
be
said
for
the
terse
apricot
peach
fruit
scents
more
pit
than
pulp
overall
has
directness
and
force
mediumbodied
here
too
retains
a
military
erectness
and
compactness
this
in
spite
of
a
strong
prickly
carbonation
to
it
the
inherent
acidity
to
it
heightens
the
sourness
of
the
lemon
orange
citrus
touches
on
white
grapefruit
theres
a
raw
yeasty
quality
next
to
the
rustic
rye
bread
element
apple
apricot
peach
cherry
fruit
more
present
here
but
not
by
much
the
oak
comes
across
as
sour
too
like
dill
herb
keeps
you
mouth
clenching
close
to
fullon
pucker
cant
fault
its
energy
level
and
has
above
average
length
and
tenacity
just
a
question
of
being
in
the
mood
for
this
style
of
beer
i
am
not
sure
if
flanders
oud
bruin
is
the
right
style
for
this
one
though
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
belgium
strong
pale
golden
alebiere
de
garde
than
it
does
a
oud
bruin
plus
petrus
makes
another
beer
that
is
actually
labeled
as
oud
bruin
while
this
beer
is
labeled
as
aged
pale
grand
reserve
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
prickly
carbonation
theres
absolutely
no
hint
of
any
alcohol
this
beer
becomes
very
drinkable
after
the
initial
sour
shock
surprisingly
drinkable
and
tasty
once
you
get
over
the
initial
surprise
of
how
sour
this
starts
maybe
if
i
had
known
this
coming
in
would
have
adapted
more
quickly
good
beer
not
one
to
seek
out
actively
but
never
one
to
turn
down
everything
seems
good
but
one
notch
too
low
as
i
begin
to
adventure
more
into
sours
this
was
a
great
start
there
was
plenty
of
funk
in
there
but
not
an
overpowering
amount
that
would
scare
me
away
d
delicious
and
refeshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
really
a
wonderfully
unique
belgian
interesting
to
say
the
least
not
really
someting
id
go
searching
for
again
but
from
what
i
researched
on
the
style
this
one
is
well
crafted
awesome
oak
afed
sour
beer
this
was
one
of
the
most
complex
aged
sours
ive
had
im
not
an
expert
in
these
beers
and
am
just
getting
into
them
but
this
kicked
the
crap
out
of
the
9
or
so
others
that
ive
had
light
almost
watery
but
smooth
finishing
with
tart
acidity
spritzy
carbonation
gives
flavor
lift
and
helps
with
refreshing
character
i
love
this
beer
and
think
all
wild
beer
fans
should
give
it
a
try
it
is
way
cheaper
than
most
wild
brews
but
does
not
lack
the
flavor
or
complexity
a
decent
sour
beer
here
you
should
give
it
a
shot

d
overall
great
one
of
the
few
sours
i
could
drink
all
day
the
oak
isnt
present
but
the
sourness
of
the
brett
and
lacto
make
this
a
more
appreciable
beer
than
supplication
or
ommegeddon
woohoo
mmm
mm
good
beer
very
interesting
big
tropical
fruit
nose
with
a
lilttle
malt
and
a
hint
of
the
flavor
to
come
sour
poured
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
fades
to
almost
none
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
very
clear
rich
gold
color
flavor
is
much
more
dry
and
much
less
fruity
than
the
nose
would
suggest
very
nice
carbonation
tartness
lingers
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
finish
is
clean
leaves
good
memories
not
sure
if
itd
be
a
session
beer
notes
talk
about
a
complex
beer
wow
totally
blow
away
by
this
one
i
love
the
interplay
between
the
nuttyoxidized
subnotes
and
the
fullon
sour
apricot
body
highly
recommend
for
fans
of
sour
beers
d
a
great
sour
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
go
tos
i
like
knowing
what
im
going
to
get
with
this
one
d
one
of
those
belgian
beers
were
you
can
really
only
have
one
at
a
time
because
of
the
unique
taste
maybe
could
have
a
second
if
it
was
paired
with
some
food
purchased
a
11
2
fl
oz
bottle
that
produced
a
hazy
golden
colored
body
with
almost
no
head
whatsoever
and
no
lace
the
immediate
taste
that
came
to
my
mind
when
first
trying
this
beer
was
a
resemblance
to
grains
with
some
sourness
like
some
of
the
other
petrus
beers
it
has
some
taste
but
eventually
fades
into
something
that
can
only
be
defined
as
watery
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
but
im
not
disappointed
that
i
bought
it
it
lacks
character
but
it
isnt
offensive
an
interesting
brew
sours
still
are
a
mystery
to
me
but
this
is
a
brew
an
lovers
of
sour
beers
should
grab
poured
into
a
basic
snifter
glass
this
ale
appears
a
mildly
cloudy
golden
straw
color
with
about
a
finger
of
bone
white
foam
the
foam
ebbs
quickly
down
to
a
thin
layer
nose
and
flavors
are
tart
sour
lemons
orange
zest
fruity
green
apples
a
hint
of
cider
vinegar
funky
a
little
too
much
carbonation
in
this
particular
bottle
for
my
tastes
with
a
medium
body
this
unique
ale
is
certainly
worth
a
try
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
thin
white
head
that
dissolves
quickly
nose
has
a
funky
aroma
of
sour
tart
light
fruit
sugar
oak
and
champagne
taste
has
sour
earthy
oak
taste
with
hints
of
light
crisp
fruit
very
carbonated
with
nice
dry
finish
it
was
ok
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
for
sure
i
sort
of
didnt
realize
that
this
was
a
sour
beer
when
i
bought
it
i
had
my
suspicions
but
i
wasnt
sure
those
suspicions
were
confirmed
upon
the
first
whiff
heavy
hints
of
oak
and
slight
vinegar
im
not
a
huge
sour
beer
drinker
but
this
was
actually
pretty
good
it
had
that
nice
malt
backbone
that
tends
to
distinguish
oud
bruins
from
say
a
gueze
this
went
surprisingly
well
with
the
berry
pie
that
i
was
eating
at
the
time
the
mouth
feel
was
sort
of
thin
and
resiny
this
was
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
one
that
im
learning
to
appreciate
itd
probably
drink
one
again
with
a
dessert
sometime
wowsers
ive
never
tasted
anything
even
close
to
this
before
this
is
a
tart
ale
color
was
light
coper
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
taste
was
like
cider
only
more
intense
it
was
sooo
overwhelming
it
hurt
drinkability
it
felt
like
having
lemonade
in
the
mouth
it
was
so
strong
the
smell
was
alot
like
a
lemon
this
was
a
unique
beer
exceptional
beer
and
unique
to
say
the
least
the
sourness
in
this
might
not
be
for
everyone
but
there
is
an
awesome
complexity
to
this
that
readily
presents
itself
especially
how
well
the
oak
flavor
comes
through
and
balances
out
a
great
beer
crisp
refreshing

i

the

its
almost
hard

gets

it
the
real
taste
starts
to
come
out
unripe

this
fades
to
a
sharp
lactic

gods
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
fits
the
style
drinkability
as
a
neophyte
to
the
sour
genre
one
is
enough
this
beer
does
provide
an
inviting
introduction
to
the
style
overall
ive
just
started
my
foray
into
sours
and
this
is
my
second
favorite
behind
haanbryggeriets
oak
aged
sour
definitely
worth
a
try
also
this
is
a
great
sour
that
wont
break
the
bank
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
terrible
and
terrible
until
i
can
get
a
new
sample
it
shall
remain
here
seriously
any
beer
that
is
above

should
be
able
to
age
for
a
couple
of
years
especially
a

i
havent
seen
many

a
nice

of

that
seem
to
work
really
well

is

this

is
not

also
i
fully
agree
that
this
is
a
sour
ale
and
should
be
labeled
as
such
however
it
is
a
belgian
and
it
is
strong
also
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
tasty
the
appearance
was
clear
gold
with
high
carbonation
and
a
nice
but
short
lived
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
very
acidic
and
sour
from
the
lactobacillus
i
think
with
low
malt
sweetness
and
some
citrus
flavors
the
hops
are
subdued
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
finishes
very
dry
after
some
thinking
my
wife
and
i
think
this
would
go
nicely
with
a
lemon
cheesecake
or
something
like
that
the
sourness
and
acidity
would
cut
through
the
fat
of
the
dessert
but
not
overpower
the
sugary
goodness
i
want

more
if
you
like
sour
ales
run
i
tell
ya
run
to
get
some
of
this
too
sour
for
me
right
now
i
think
i
needed
another
bottle
of
this
for
my
review
to
do
it
justice
not
sure
if
i
liked
it
or
not
to
be
honest
it
was
a
unique
taste
and
style
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
to
think
about
it
further
puckeringly
tart
beyond
anything
ive
experienced
tarter
than
a
flanders
red
and
bone
dry
to
boot
all
moisture
is
instantly
sucked
back
into
whatever
pore
it
emerged
from
when
this
hits
your
palate
after
the
taste
buds
get
a
chance
to
recuperate
and
realize
they
are
not
being
attacked
notes
of
pear

appear
with

notes
of

i
wouldnt
classify
this
as
a

i

way
too
sour
for
that
category
and
i
really
think
it
tastes
more
like
a
flemish
red
reminds
me
a
lot
of
rodenbach
grand
cru
a
good
beer
but
should
be
labeled
for
what
it
is
d
decent
sour
fairly
common
as
far
as
sours
go
but
that
still
means
its
pretty
good
not
as
complex
as
it
could
be
but
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
slightly
above
average
overall
this
beer
is
far
too
expensive
for
its
return
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
certainly
is
no
pale
ale
ive
never
had
a
flanders
red
but
from
what
i
can
gather
this
is
what
they
taste
like
i
really
enjoyed
the
distinctness
of
the
flavor
recommended
but
beware
this
is
not
a
pale
ale
all
things
aside
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
very
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
my
usual
flanders
red
highly
recommended
for
sour
beer
lovers

a
bit
much
for
those
just
crossing

beer

should
i
say
a
musty

a
try
youll
love
it
or
hate
it
this
is
a
very

beer
and
the

is
invisible
i
think
it
is
finally
beginning
to
turn
possibly
3
years
old
now
but
has
been
excellent
up
until
now
not
one
that
i
would
drink
a
6pack
of
in
a
night
if
your
turned
off
by
the
sourness
then
your
just
a
wimp
pours
out
a
small
head
that
goes
away
and
leaves
a
lacing
thats
kinda
weak
the
color
is
golden
like
champagne
smell
is
sour
so
is
the
taste
its
very
fruity
and
sour
at
the
same
time
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
of
these
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
fades
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much

is
very
sour

lots
of
sour
apples

very
thin
and
onesided
the
sourness
sticks
to

the
drinkability
is

little
rough
due
to
the
extreme
sourness
pours
clear

around
4
a
bottle
this
is
a
good
treat
especially
if
youre
sick
of
the
same
old
beer
styles
ive
become
a
huge
fan
recently
of
the
sour
side
of
brewing
and
this
is
no
exception
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
extremely
well
and
is
hardly
discernible
drinkability
lovely
to
sip
on
and
spread
across
the
tongue
as
it
plays
upon
the
different
taste
receptors
the
mouth
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
and
lots
of
pucker
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
could
have
several
more
before
the
abv
gets
me
this
beer
is
meant
for
pairing
with
food
imo
in
all
seriousness
i
just
ran
around
the
homestead
tasting
this
with
all
sorts
of
stuff
it
really
brings
out
salinity
in
things
even
no
salt
added
pretzels
i
would
bet
this
would
kick
ass
with
some
chowdah
damn
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
just
clicks
with
me

sour
slighty
thin
hints
of
rosehips
herbs
and
other
floral
flavors
there
are
also
crisp
sour
apple
notes
with
a
bit
of
acidic
citrus
tang
in
the
finish
pretty
nice
and
lighter
and
crisper
than
most
i
have
had
of
this
style
kind
of
addictive
taste
once
you
get
over
the
shock
like
sour
candy
this
is
quite
a
nice
beer
to
drink
but
in
the
end
it
is
not
nearly
as
complex
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
without
the
malt
character
of
a
sour
brown
or
red
it
really
needs
some
more
funkiness
to
it
to
strike
a
balance
with
the
dominant
acidity
uf
this
is
an
infinitely
complex
beer
that
oozes
old
world
quality
and
charm
its
obvious
that
great
care
has
been
taken
in
its
creation
so
too
should
great
care
be
taken
in
its
consumption
petrus
aged
pale
is
quite
simply
beautiful
beer
the
alcohol
is
never
noticeable
and
for
those
that
enjoyacceptcan
get
past
the
brazen
acidity
this
is
a
superbly
refreshing
and
remarkably
palatecleansing
and
invigorating
beer
magnificent
a
great
beer
that
completely
caught
me
off
guard
11
2
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
dating
drinkability
reminds
me
of
a
red
flanders
more
than
anything
kind
of
like
a
duchesse
just
as
good
also
if
not
better
this
is
no
session
beer
a
sipper
to
be
sure
drinkability
for
someone
that
doesnt
drink
many
belgian
ales
i
dont
recoment
this
beer
its
not
a
good
start
into
the
belgian
world
just
a
little
rough
unless
you
like
the
sour
i
feel
that
i
failed
this
beer
its
much
too
good
for
my
nonsophisticated
pallet
ill
work
on
it
d
very
interesting
pale
ale
it
has
some
sour
notes
and
hints
of
lemon
but
its
not
a
bad
lemon
very
crisp
and
clean
now
well
never
know
sorry
but
that
is
where
the
good
times
ended
the
smell
and
flavor
were
sour
earthy
and
animal
in
nature
it
was
painful
to
drink
and
i
didnt
finish
it
i
was
making
faces
and
gutteral
noises
like
the
losers
on
fear
factor
without
a
few
grand
sitting
in
the
wings
i
wont
be
tackling
this
brew
again
on
the
nose
are
layers
of
soda
including
but
not
limited
to
vanilla
lime
cola
peach
and
cherry
the
whole
towne
club
line
it
seems
remarkable
flavors
ride
a
wave
of
fat
fizz
starting
with
something
similar
to
licking
sap
directly
off
the
bark
of
a
sugar
maple
then
rapidly
narrowing
into
an
acidic
flume
of
limeade
ill
drink
more
no
dating
was
gifted
this
one
so
who
knows
the
age
a
few
yeasty
chunks
floating
around
up
to
the
white
frothy
head
that
sat
in
a
ring
and
dusting
lemon
juice
scented
cellard
bit
vineous
slightly
musty
the
carbonation
is
so
mellow
but
the
gentle
bubbles
just
slightly
bite
your
lips
when
the
glass
comes
to
your
lips
the
carb
is
nice
and
tight
bitey
and
shap
pungent
flavors
almost
hars
but
sooo
good
very
aged
tasting
cellared
and
lovely
bit
bitter
sharp
at
the
edges
and
back
of
your
tongue
and
then
the
top
of
your
mouth
not
too
sharp
that
it
locks
you
up
like
a
guezuze
nice
good
as
a
sipper
the
flavors
are
there
to
be
experienced
and
thought
about
aromas
of
mountain
honey
and
whole
grain
biscuits
are
carried
on
a
wave
of
briny
barrelaged
applesauce
the
flavors
are
very
sour
acidity
interlaces
with
melting
fruit
nuts
and
buttery
crust
flavors
notes
of
vanilla
are
beaten
down
by
crabapple
and
lime
sourness
the
gas
is
lively
extremely
refreshing
finishing
aromatics
of
lemon
flesh
fino
sherry
wild
grasses
and
blooms
make
it
hard
to
stop
drinking
this
beer
the
texture
is
not
without
seams
though
a
little
more
extract
and
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
its
an
albino
rodenbach
grand
cru
of
old
amazing
i
was
very
highly
disappointed
with
this
beer
there
is
not
really
anything
good
that
i
can
say
about
it
it
poured
to
a
clear
strawberry
blonde
color
with
very
little
head
that
faded
to
absolutely
nothing
the
smell
and
taste
were
horrid
like
drinking
vinegar
straight
i
ended
up
pouring
this
out
less
than
half
way
through
i
never
thought
i
would
see
the
day
where
i
wasnt
even
able
to
finish
a
beer
as
bad
as
they
are
ive
always
been
able
to
finish
a
cheap
macro
lager
but
not
this
which
was
unfortunately
rather
costly
as
it
is
a
belgian
import
i
would
definitely
not
recommend
it
this
brew
is
a
lighterorange
hazy
body
fairly
small
white
head
on
the
top
great
scent
mixture
of
bubbly
gum
sweetness
fruity
tones
and
malts
intense
rush
of
flavors
for
generous
carbonation
smooth
malt
somewhat
sour
lemon
zest
bread
some
bitter
hop
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
id
say
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
but
candi
sugar
and
more
malt
sweetness
would
make
it
absolutely
delicious
if
only
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
smelled
still
this
is
great
stuff
and
i
would
gladly
drink
it
again
poured
the
bulk
of
this
one
out
33
cl
bottle
pours
a
clear
straw
pale
gold
colored
with
a
fizzy
white
head
streaming
carbonation
after
head
settles
honey
and
sour
flowery
nose
earthy
and
oaky
tastes
like
honey
at
first
and
then
gets
gripping
sour
and
dry
notes
in
the
finish
oak
aging
is
present
throughout
healthy
carbonation
keeps
it
crisp
on
the
palate
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
for
many
reasons
it
drinks
like
a
flemish
red
or
brown
except
it
has
pale
characteristics
like
a
chardonnay
versus
a
cabernet
in
the
sense
that
theyre
both
dry
but
are
essentially
different
i
dont
even
drink
wine
bottled
thanks
to
mat
this
was
so
good
just
amazingly
sour
and
tart
really
wild
oaky
character
so
well
balanced
juicy
and
refreshing
lemony
and
some
funky
earthy
barnyard
stuff
going
on
i
justed
wanted
to
drink
more
and
more
and
more
great
beer
yum
complex
refined
and
great
for
the
style
but
beyond
the
sourness
there
isnt
much
flavor
here
nor
body
lemon
grapefruit
and
green
apple
are
present
in
the
back
of
the
palate
totally
different
from
red
ales
and
oud
bruins
i
have
had
in
the
past
clear
peachygold
in
hue
with
just
a
tickle
of
amber
interwoven
there
is
no
animation
yet
a
bubbly
white
head
of
one
finger
in
height
formed
not
surprisingly
the
head
retention
was
fair
at
best
before
long
the
head
fizzled
to
a
loose
cap
soapy
with
naked
pockets
subsequent
lacing
was
spotty
the
appearance
is
pleasant
but
dull
the
nose
is
vibrantly
acidic
awesome
sharp
lemony
notes
dominant
hints
of
wood
at
the
back
there
is
some
distant
spice
and
alcohol
peppery
minty
light
yeasty
funk
everything
aside
from
the
acidity
is
light
to
faint
in
potency
while
i
cant
call
the
nose
complex
i
cant
call
it
simplistic
either
it
is
very
inviting
with
enough
layers
to
damn
near
force
me
to
drink
well
the
nose
didnt
lie
the
palate
is
very
acidic
my
first
sip
shocked
me
a
bit
i
got
over
it
needless
to
say
lemony
flavors
developed
dry
in
the
middle
woody
too
with
faint
hints
of
pepper
and
mint
right
before
the
finish
there
is
a
juicy
burst
but
the
finish
is
dry
and
quick
to
end
overall
the
palate
is
lackluster
as
there
isnt
much
going
on
sure
i
like
what
i
taste
but
i
want
more
of
it
and
more
complementary
flavors
as
well
i
must
complement
the
fact
that
i
cant
taste
the
alcohol
the
very
light
carbonation
is
noticeable
and
more
is
needed
medium
in
body
but
it
feels
a
bit
too
light
empty
also
the
aftertaste
is
too
clean
did
i
just
sip
a
belgium
ale
my
mouth
says
no
overall
this
beer
doesnt
impress
me
at
all
i
dont
think
ill
bother
with
this
one
again
as
there
are
many
better
beers
akin
to
this
one
for
some
unknown
reason
i
put
off
sampling
this
beer
since
february
i
bought
my
bottle
in
iowa
city
disappointing
once
i
got
past
that
weird
smell
this
was
rather
enjoyable
light
crisp
and
refreshing
this
beer
poured
a
golden
color
and
formed
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
cherry
vinous
quality
with
some
wood
aspects
a
flavor
of
cherry
vinous
with
some
lemon
present
with
a
touch
of
grain
a
sournesstartness
one
would
expect
in
this
type
with
a
slight
astrigent
aspect
thanks
rodolito
for
a
rare
and
marvellous
example
appearance
is
first
a
surprise
but
you
get
to
love
it
like
a
child
whos
the
smallest
of
his
class
by
a
head
this
cant
be
clearer
i
see
my
finger
prints
through
it
but
the
head
my
friends
is
the
perfect
white
sticky
as
if
it
werent
enough
the
body
is
pure
liquid
gold
very
shining
spectacular
one
may
say
very
effervescent
from
the
outside
look
aroma
of
wet
hay
apple
cider
grass
saison
anyone
a
bit
of
funk
a
definite
sour
touch
dry
not
unlike
a
good
champaign
grassy
isnt
this
well
structured
and
beautiful
in
mouth
this
is
also
reminiscent
of
champaign
very
white
wine
alike
in
the
dryness
lightly
bitter
finish
which
adds
a
new
complexity
moderately
malty
with
peaches
and
pears
flavors
its
mostly
about
the
delicate
dryness
though
puckering
and
hayish
mouthfeel
is
quite
biting
thinmedium
and
a
nice
fit
i
feel
i
dont
have
the
words
to
do
it
justice
though
thered
be
a
lot
more
to
say
but
its
hard
to
be
put
in
words
very
complex
for
sure
and
rather
tart
with
gueuze
character
lovely
dry
aftertaste
i
think
this
would
be
hard
to
drink
in
any
kind
of
large
quantities
though
just
like
champaign
once
again
truly
in
a
class
of
its
own
and
worth
seeking
out
it
pours
a
dark
gold
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
thin
white
head
it
is
musty
smelling
and
i
can
tell
it
is
going
to
be
sour
i
like
it
already
the
body
is
lean
with
some
wood
barrel
notes
the
sourness
hits
up
front
but
it
is
malty
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
too
puckering
there
are
some
honey
and
floral
flavors
it
finishes
with
some
oak
and
warming
alcohol
from
the
typical
11
2
oz
brown
bottle
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
goldenorange
with
a
frothy
white
head
the
smell
is
tart
with
some
citrus
notes
but
the
smell
doesnt
really
prepare
you
for
the
taste
this
stuff
is
tart
tart
almost
gueuzelike
in
its
ability
to
pucker
every
orifice
in
the
body
although
its
a
bit
of
a
shock
at
firsteven
for
the
normally
tart
styleit
seems
to
mellow
after
a
few
sips
and
a
bit
of
warming
its
certainly
not
an
allday
beer
but
its
another
nice
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
mouthfeel
lip
smacking
tartness
upfront
subsides
as
soon
as
the
palate
becomes
accustom
to
the
level
of
acidity
oak
flavours
draw
the
mouth
towards
dry
yet
there
is
just
enough
sweetness
from
the
grain
to
meld
with
the
tartness
for
a
sweettart
juicy
middle
hints
of
earthiness
show
a
complex
yeast
faint
sherry
character
as
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
becomes
more
apparent
with
its
slightly
ester
profile
finishes
with
more
wood
on
a
dry
note
petrus
aged
pale
grand
reserve
was
served
from
a
330
ml
bottle
depicting
a
pair
of
rugged
belgian
men
handling
an
oak
barrel
suspended
from
a
chain
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
chalice
style
glass
with
a
fizzy
head
rising
and
quickly
falling
to
become
a
ring
and
scattered
spots
of
foam
leaving
fine
persistent
lacing
the
murky
glowing
pale
peach
liquid
was
alive
with
fizzy
vigor
like
a
magical
potion
the
aged
pale
was
also
alive
in
the
nose
spewing
out
potent
clouds
of
tart
fruit
candy
powder
late
harvest
grapes
and
acidic
oaky
pinot
noir
the
taste
was
crisp
and
dry
with
a
moderately
acidic
peachy
tartness
held
up
by
an
excellent
body
full
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonated
it
finished
with
a
quickly
diminishing
dry
acidity
leaving
only
faint
traces
of
tart
essence
on
the
palate
good
but
a
little
short
on
the
finish
this
was
an
enjoyable
sour
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
fellow
fans
of
sourtart
beers
finish
is
actually
smoothly
acidic
disappearing
off
the
palate
yet
leaving
a
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
lips
appearance
golden
amber
with
a
nice
sized
frothy
white

more
than
abundant

im
happy
so
lets
move
on

very
tart
to
the
nose
with
a
cidery
dry
finish
to
the
nose
here
not
much
hop
profile
apparent
but
the
tartness
sure
sticks
out
like
a
sore
thumb
taste
coats
the
palate
with
a
balanced
tart
sensation
letting
out
a
meaty
malt
profile
with
sweet
flavor
that
came
with
the
aging
and
the
oak
barrel
definitely
shines
its
light
through
in
the
flavor
of
this
aged
ale
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
ale
with
a
puckering
effect
on
the
palate
that
gives
my
taste
buds
a
craving
for
more
of
the
same
drinkability
in
closing
all
hail
the
flemish
style
pale
ale
from
petrus
it
brings
joy
to
i
this
fine
evening
a
must
try
if
you
see
it
excellent
notes
a
beautiful
beer
as
the
beer
caresses
the
mouth
the
tartness
awakens
the
taste
buds
very
refreshing
and
a
perfect
pair
to
a
simple
goat
cheese
this
beer
is
not
for
quaffing

savour
every
drop

are

enough
not

an

very
much
like
an

in

it

best
served
somewhere
between
room
and
fridge
temperature
the
flavor
blooms
as
it
warms
i
dont
know
im
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
it
did
pair
well
with
some
fresh
mozzerella
with
the
acidity
contrasting
nicely
with
the
softness
of
the
cheese
still
theres
not
much
there
just
a
mouthfull
of
bitterness
overall
impression
a
neutral
beer
petrus
makes
to
blend
with
their
regional
offerings
it
is
also
intended
for
export
to
the
us
though
it
is
not
for
sale
here
commercially
thats
ok
because
id
rather
spend
my
time
with
a
good
gueuze
instead
of
this
stuff
i
ordered
this
one
based
on
my
servers
recommendation
but
i
wished
that
i
had
disregarded
him
instead

drinkability

ill
give
my
bottom
dollar
to
the
guy
that
can
chug
this
bottle
this
is
a
sipping
wine
i
like
it
before
dinner
or
late
at
night
it
doesnt
really
go
good
with
any
foods
imo
my
penchant
is
to
take
this
style
on
an
empty
stomach
preferably
while
sitting
in
front
of
the
tube
watching
the
ms
play
ball
ok
ill
admit
this
beer
is
way
over
my
head
as
far
as
my
experience
with
a
with
a
wide
range
of
beers
i
had
never
had
anything
quite
like
this
the
yeast
yields
a
near
cider
fruit
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
still
full
and
the
finish
is
fruity
and
light
with
a
citric
aftertaste
the
whole
flavor
is
absolutely
out
of
this
world
and
the
drinkability
is
second
to
none
i
like
the
sourness
with
alomost
a
vinegary
flavour
very
drinakable
and
recomeneded
source
great
beers
of
belgium
im
a
big
fan
of
all
things
belgian
beer
that
is
i
received
this
as
part
of
the
belgian
beer
of
the
month
club
and
thought
it
was
the
most
disgusting
thing
i
have
ever
drank
in
my
life
even
worse
than
a
caribe
shandy
i
cant
believe
that
others
have
rated
it
so
highly
the
beer
was
so
sour
that
i
thought
it
had
gone
bad
apparently
i
am
not
a
fan
of
sour
beers
i
will
definitely
avoid
any
others
i
come
across
the
petrus
looked
halfway
decent
in
the
glass
but
thats
the
only
positive
thing
i
can
say
about
it
the
pour
is
a
lightly
foggy
gold
or
straw
color
the
head
is
massive
and
the
lace
in
firm
sheets
that
clings
to
the
glass
till
the
very
end
both
a
brilliant
white
but
alas
they
do
desiccates
to
quickly
for
my
liking
nose
is
has
an
unmistakable
tartness
that
borders
on
being
astringent
also
there
is
malt
citrus
and
oak
undertones
an
interesting
nose
to
be
sure
front
is
malt
but
the
massive
sourness
hits
you
immediately
the
top
skimpy
the
finish
is
devastatingly
acidic
pertinently
hopped
dry
as
a
bone
aftertaste
one
damn
fine
beer
ive
not
sampled
a
great
number
of
redsour
beers
but
i
do
like
this
beer
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
in
my
experience
its
strong
has
a
musty
but
pleasant
smell
its
sweet
with
a
bite
its
very
different
and
at
first
sip
most
people
are
a
bit
taken
back
try
try
again
this
beer
you
definatly
have
to
go
in
with
a
clear
mindknowing
that
this
beer
is
like
nothing
you
have
ever
had
before
rustic
nose
and
you
can
smell
the
tartness
first
thought
was
this
taste
like
rodenbach
grand
cruand
i
thought
that
bottle
was
badcome
to
find
out
that
is
the
stylewho
would
have
thought
so
please
go
in
to
these
beer
with
the
knowledge
that
they
are
different
but
ive
got
to
back
up
for
a
moment
initially
the
smell
intrigued
me
very
sweet
and
spicy
with
a
mix
of
fruits
and
a
touch
of
honey
and
yeast
thrown
in
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
something
different
i
loved
this
beer
at
the
first
sip
it
has
a
sour
tartness
along
with
with
a
fair
malt
sweetness
the
sweet
and
sour
flavors
causes
a
pleasantly
bizarre
blend
that
i
honestly
cannot
explain
fully
ill
just
have
to
stick
with
my
original
though
not
very
eloquent
statement
that
petrus
aged
pale
kicks
ass
the
first
sip
i
had
of
this
beer
instantly
reminded
me
of
rodenbach
for
very
good
reasons
nicely
complex
sweet
sour
beer
in
the
flanders
style
definitely
requires
some
getting
used
to
but
most
people
i
have
shared
the
beers
with
ended
up
enjoying
after
the
initial
shock
as
you
move
the
beer
around
your
mouth
as
is
common
with
this
style
the
flavor
profile
will
change
fairly
dramatically
drinks
almost
like
a
good
wine
petrus
aged
pale
is
a
very
refreshing
winelike
beer
great
for
summers
spent
lounging
in
a
deck
chair
man
oh
man
what
a
beer
first
of
all
if
youre
new
to
the
flanders
style
sour
beers
be
prepared
for
your
next
beer
epiphany
the
first
sip
puckers
your
face
inside
out
dont
judge
the
beer
yet
keep
going
and
youll
become
hooked
the
intermingling
of
sweetsour
is
simply
amazing
extremely
complex
yet
refreshing
seek
it
out
i
dont
really
like
it
2011
vintage
really
not
much
going
on
here
smelled
like
vinegar
tasted
like
carbonated
water
with
a
just
a
tiny
hint
of
malt
sweetness
high
c
lemony
cherry
nose
with
traces
of
barnyard

brilliant
chestnut
under
a

fluffy
tannish
offwhite
cap
that
dissipates
to
a
thick
film
a
tart
lemony
citrus
cherry
palate
with
traces
of
chocolate
hints
of
fruitcake
moderately
high
finely
bubbled
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
juicy
and
refreshing
i
would
drink
it
again
effervescent
with
a
light
medium
body
this
one
was
solid
except
for
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
that
i
was
not
a
fan
of
tart
fruit
and
light
brown
sugar
light
vanilla
and
earthy
woodiness
great
brew
im
surprised
i
havent
rated
this
before
finishing
off
my
day
at
firkin
by
revisiting
a
beer
i
vaguely
remember
trying
way
back
in
my
nova
days
it
pours
a
clear
midnight
tawny
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
dark
khaki
foam
the
nose
basically
reminds
me
of
a
jar
if
one
were
to
exist
of
course
of
maple
syrupladen
malt
vinegar
the
taste
flips
things
a
bit
having
some
tart
vinegar
tinging
dry
maple
syrup
with
a
touch
of
muted
brine
making
a
brief
cameo
near
the
beginning
of
the
finish
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
slick
feel
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
an
odd
beer
really
what
with
its
inability
to
decide
on
a
flavor
path
vinegarleaning
or
maltily
sweet
but
it
still
retains
its
drinkability
interesting
take
on
the

the

carbonation
is
a
little
high
and
aggressive
making
it
feel
unrefined
for
the
style
it
had
a
sourness
that
wasnt
overwhelming
and
made
me
taste
buds
pucker
but
not
for
long
its
a
unique
sour
beer
that
one
should
try
to
expierence
the
vast
varitey
of
brews
as
someone
who
is
not
well
versed
in
sours
this
is
delicious
the
sourness
is
there
but
not
overbearing
black
cherries
sweet
malt
nutty
some
funk
medium
carbonation
its
pretty
light
and
one
dimensional
clean
finish
although
i
can
tell
this
is
pretty
tame
for
a
sour
its
fantastic
a
very
welcome
and
unique
departure
from
the
usual
of
ipas
stouts
and
pale
ales
definitely
worth
a
try
i
hesitate
to
even
review
this
given
that
i
dont
think
i
like
the
oud
bruin
style
i
e
ignore
the
rating
that
said
this
seems
to
fit
the
style
well
strong
full
aroma
of
oak
and
tannins
puckery
mouthfeel
and
a
mild
sourness
in
both
the
lead
and
finish
persistent
head
pretty
redbrown
color
worth
trying
if
youre
into
sour
beers
nutty
and
grassy
refreshing
to
an
unusual
degree
for
a
tart
brew
this
is
a
great
beer
for
people
like
myself
who
like
sours
but
havent
yet
acquired
the
taste
for
the
most
extreme
puckering
outer
limit
of
the
style
if
that
describes
you
this
beer
is
probably
underrated
good
sour
fruit
flavors
cherries
maybe
green
apple
and
grapes
i
did
not
pick
up
anything
from
the
wood
the
finish
is
very
nice
with
lingering
flavors
of
grape
juice
my
experience
with
all
other
petrus
offerings
has
resulted
in
them
becoming
my
benchmark
for
sours
this
did
not
go
there
but
i
think
it
was
not
supposed
to
as
a
brown
it
really
balanced
the
malty
sweetness
with
what
flanders
tends
to
bring
with
sour
this
beer
is
ripe
for
pairing
with
hearty
stew
fairly
underrated
brew
the
aroma
does
not
nearly
match
the
flavor
melanoidins
sweet
toasted
bread
caramel
dominate
flavor
is
fairly
dark
malty
and
sweet
but
theres
a
nice
tart
lactic
finish
to
contrast
overall
a
pretty
good
standard
sour
mildly
sour
but
not
very
complex
in
flavor
ok
at
the
right
price
point
but
i
would
generally
seek
out
other
choices
of
this
style
o
this
may
be
a
good
sour
for
those
just
dipping
into
sours
but
i
expect
a
lot
more
from
my
sours
good
thing
i
didnt
pay
a
lot
for
this
in
the
sour
power
box
a
delicious
classic
beer
brilliant

but
soon
tart
and
malty

dry
soft
mouthfeel
low

well
with
the
tart
taste
the
carbonation
does
not
overpower
the
beer
or
accentuate
it
too
much
in
other
words
the
carbonation
level
is
just
about
right
drank
at
the
friendly
place

with

not
bad
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
id
happily
have
it
again
though
o
probably
a
good
representative
of
the
style
but
my
taste
for
the
style
hasnt
developed
enough
for
me
to
enjoy
this
fully
or
to
be
able
to
rate
it
accurately
versus
other
oud
bruins
for
example
overall
not
as

as
i
was

also
not

as
most
beers
within
this
style
flavours
are
nice
though
and
it
is
easy
to
drink

not

just

its
a

the

have
it
again

almost
inexistent

its

a
little
solid
beer
but
nothing
special
due
to
its
widespread
availability
when
the
mood
strikes
it
should
be
easy
to
find
i
can
see
this
not
being
true
to
an
oud
bruin
style
with
its
curbing
if
the
tart
flavors
however
it
worked
well
for
me
o
not
much
there
really
very
one
dimensional
and
that
one
dimension
isnt
very
memorable
overall
not
the
best
oud
bruin
ive
had
but
its
clean
it
needs
more
tartness
in
the
taste
and
could
do
without
the
odd
soapy
character
overall
i
enjoyed
my
first
foray
into
the
oud
bruin
style
and
from
what
i
can
gather
this
was
a
good
label
to
start
with
though
i
much
prefer
a
good
sour
flanders
red
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
since
this
is
my
first
oud
bruin
im
not
very
familiar
with
this
style
but
this
beer
seems
to
be
pretty
in
line
with
the
description
of
the
style
on
beeradvocate
but
i
think
ill
have
to
revisit
this
beer
once
i
try
more
of
the
style
to
get
a
better
idea
of
where
it
stands
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
not
too
acidic
not
too
filling
a
little
refreshing
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
in
the
summer
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
i
thought
it
was
very
nice
and
i
really
liked
how
fruity
and
sour
it
was
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
taste
wasnt
more
like
the
aroma
i
wish
that
intensity
that
i
got
in
the
aroma
showed
up
in
the
taste
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
i
enjoyed
it
and
its
priced
pretty
reasonably
especially
for
a
belgian
beer
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
fruity
and
tart
beers
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
pretty
solid
its
not
the
best
sour
and
fruity
beer
i
have
had
but
it
was
good
for
what
it
is
and
i
thought
it
had
pretty
good
drinkability
im
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
this
beer
and
ill
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
oud
bruins
and
more
petrus
beers
nice
job
guys
keep
up
the
good
work
o
this
is
new
to
me
nice
blend
of
a
brown
ale
and
a
sour
2012
bottle
taste
starts
smooth
and
silky
with
active
carbonation
adding
to
a
light
body
mildly
sour
with
faint
hints
of
tart
cherry
with
subtle
hint
of
vanilla
likely
from
the
barrel
aging
compared
to
oud
bruin
from
verzet
this
is
far
more
refined

you
wanted

based
on
the
above
one
might
think
to
write
this
brew
off
as
dull
or
underwhelming
but
that
is
not
the
case
at
all
though
mild
the
flavor
is
sophisticated
and
admirably
cohesive
it
looks
luscious
and
i
just
feel
classy
drinking
it
it
probably
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
hard
to
find
something
not
to
like
about
it
final
thoughts
so
not
super
impressed
with

just
not
a

one
it
lacks
the
complexity
and
intensity
that
i
look
for
in

i
suppose
the

components
of
this
brew
would
pair
with
some
blue
cheese
or
something
similarly
sharp
but
a

of
their
bottles
look
alike
i
really
like
the
petrus
aged
ale
which
is
the
true
sour
as
i
drink
a
few
more
sips
some
brown
sugary
sweetness
with
the
faintest
hints
of
earthy
funk
and
damp
wood
taste
brings
the
fruit

and
possesses
a
few
off
flavors
in
areas
that
lack
sour
ales
though
e
g
fresno
o
i
have
to
say
im
definitely
becoming
more
of
a
fan
of
this
style
as
ive
enjoyed
several
of
these
recently
i
think
this
is
a
quality
brew
very
approachable
and
it
is
very
delicate
i
would
pair
it
with
food
very
carefully
as
any
strong
flavors
could
potentially
wash
it
out
o
pretty
decent
brew
i
would
like
a
little
more
developed
flavor
as
it
seemed
like
a
pretty
basic
belgian
flavor
profile
with
a
little
tartness
thrown
in
i
would
have
liked
more
sourness
but
then
i
am
probably
looking
to
the
wrong
style
for
that
not
a
bad
brew
would
drink
it
again
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
esp
at
4
for
a
12
oz
bottle
o
overall
this
one
surprised
me
very
cool
very
different
but
one
ill
probably
pick
up
again
overall
wow
now
this
was
a
great
beer
im
glad
i
came
back
to
will
be
buying
this
again
drinkability
is
easy
and
very
different
from
any
other
oud
bruin
im
thinking
that
is
why
the
flanders
is
in
front
of
it
will
be
interested
in
seeing
how
other
people
react
and
give
their
two
cents
on
this
beer
taste
again
very
soft
and
leaning
more
towards
sweet
than
sour
a
slight
cherry
flavour
is
present
but
overall
very
restrained
and
reserved
nowhere
near
as
sour
or
complex
as
i
expected
from
this
style
deep
red
color
nose
a
little
cellar
we
feel
that
the
beer
comes
from
more
than
12
months
of
barrel
fermentation
macerated
fruit
but
also
great
power
slightly
tannic
palate
but
without
original
flavors
if
not
subtle
acidity
made
by
some
currants
it
just
also
add
persistence
in
the
aftertaste
that
sounds
a
little
card
so
a
good
oud
bruin
but
very
foolish
and
unable
to
stand
liefmans
standards
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
also
not
one
id
reach
for
when
in
want
of
an
oud
bruin
verdict
very
nice
and
refreshing
but
not
top
tier
a
good
beer
thats
worth
trying
but
id
prefer
slightly
less
vibrant
carbonation
o
good
drinker
and
i
thought
this
was
a
well
balance
and
unique
beer
overall
this
is
a
bit
on
a
average
side
nothing
really
stands
out
d
for
the
money
a
great
bang
for
your
buck
stylewise
smooth
and
easy
drinking
while
still
fitting
the
style
well
quite
sessionable
when
you
are
looking
for
a
oud
bruin
a
very
easy
drinker
and
the
least
imposing
sour
beer
ive
ever
had
the
aroma
had
me
pretty
excited
but
the
flavor
while
not
bad
at
all
is
very
subdued
from
start
to
finish
overall
its
okay
not
a
strong
sourness
at
all
which
is
a
little
disappointing
but
im
not
too
mad
i
got
this
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
going
in
with
huge
expectations
x
o
this
is
my
first
flandersstyle
ale
and
i
wasnt
sure
i
was
gonna
like
it
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
smells
more
sour
than
it
really
is
rounds
out
nicely
on
the
pallete
im
not
sure
i
will
buy
it
again
but
i
will
drink
this
one
and
im
glad
ive
tried
it
dvery
easy
to
drink
the
flavors
and
booze
combine
well
nothing
really
great
about
this
beer
but
def
a
nice
drinkable
beer
d
interesting
flavor
and
aroma
the
body
is
a
little
thinner
than
expected
still
this
stands
out
as
a
different
style
than
your
everyday
stouts
and
pales
not
as
good
as
the
petrus
oak
pale
but
still
very
drinkable
good
carbonation
and
taste
although
it
was
a
little
weak
compared
to
others
of
its
kind
that
being
said
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
as
it
was
drinkable
and
i
need
a
second
opinion
d
easy
to
drink
yet
wonderfully
complex
that
being
said
its
got
good
carbonation
and
finishes
clean
i
could
shotgun
this
does
that
make
it
drinkable
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
mystery
and
i
wish
it
was
more
hrm
d
pretty
good
drinkability
but
couldnt
handle
more
than
a
couple
at
a
time
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
and
certainly
one
id
drink
happily
if
it
were
available
but
also
as
certainly
not
something
extravagant
and
special
o
very
drinkable
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
it
might
not
have
been
super
complex
but
it
was
very
well
balanced
and
pleasant
to
drink
comparable
to
bellegems
maybe
someday
ill
have
to
do
a
blind
tastings
not
sure
whats
going
on
with
the
metallic
presence
infected
yeast
regardless
certainly
not
as
impressive
as
petrus
aged
pale
considering
the
perceived
off
taste
probably
worth
another
try
overall
ok
beer
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
does
not
have
near
the
complexity
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
this
is
nonoffensive
but
even
monks
cafe
is
better
steping
stone
into
oud
bruins
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
poured
deep
brown
with
a
half
finger
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
fairly
quickly
maintains
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
slight
sour
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
slight
sour
and
fruit
on
the
followthrough
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
brew
was
pretty
nice
and
smooth
had
a
nice
flavor
but
the
aroma
was
kind
of
weak
as
far
as
intensity
the
flavor
was
very
pleasing
though
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
without
hesitation
dwell
considering
i
wanted
it
to
be
over
once
i
took
my
first
sip
ill
say
this
isnt
too
drinkable
i
feel
this
is
a
beer
for
wine
lovers
but
not
for
too
many
beer
lovers
a
full
bottle
is
difficult
to
finish
d
a
drinkable
beer
but
the
carbination
could
be
toned
down
and
im
intrigued
to
know
if
the
tartness
would
dissapear
with
age
and
the
sweetness
would
come
through
a
bit
more
t
slightly
sweet
light
and
somewhat
fruity
with
a
bit
of
malt
character
finishes
with
brown
sugar
and
some
dark
fruits
overall
this
was
an
okay
beer
but
ive
had
others
of
the
style
that
i
prefer
such
as
monks
cafe
petrus
oud
bruin
comes
with
a
pop
when
the
cork
is
removed
pours
out
a
dark
red
and
becomes
a
dark
brown
when
condensed
in
the
glass
some
maroon
spots
with
red
showing
towards
the
side
a
nice
sturdy
dirty
tan
head
billows
above
ok
lace
this
bruin
does
not
smell
overly
sweet
and
vinegar
laden
thank
god
i
get
big
time
cherry
and
plum
other
dark
fruits
comes
off
vinious
taste
is
superb
a
great
mix
starts
off
mildly
sweet
going
into
a
slight
sour
twist
with
a
aftertaste
of
cherry
oak
does
not
come
out
that
much
and
this
spent
like
30
months
in
the
dark
that
will
tell
you
how
fruit
forward
this
is
feel
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
while
light
bodied
and
easily
drinkable
the
finish
comes
off
a
bit
rusty
and
bumpy
leaving
a
semi
metallic
taste
afterwards
which
is
strange
all
in
all
another
drinkable
beer
from
the
boys
at
bavikpetrus
i
expect
them
to
send
a
ton
of
this
to
philly
as
they
did
with
the
aged
pale
they
literally
flooded
the
market
with
that
one
i
could
drink
a
big
bomber
of
this
to
the
head
no
problem
5
5
yep
d
this
is
a
solid
sour
and
from
them
paired
very
well
with
some
goose
liver
mouse
overall
this
is
another
pretty
good
easily
found
and
affordable
flanders
but
lacks
a
little
special
something
to
make
it
great
the
taste
is
thin
yet
satisfying
the
dark
color
bespeaks
a
more
complex
beer
but
the
petrus
oud
bruin
delivers
with
a
pleasant
sour
finish
its
not
a
lambic
not
a
fruit
beer
rather
a
malty
tart
treat
probably
not
sessionable
but
a
pleasant
drink
nonetheless
d
this
isnt
as
good
as
the
aged
pale
it
is
less
assertive
with
the
tart
quality
and
falls
short
of
being
a
great
brew
petrus
oud
bruin
does
not
have
the
richness
or
complexity
of
other
ales
aged
in
wood
casks
theres
no
hint
of
vanilla
or
oddly
any
wood
flavor
instead
it
has
the
light
bubbly
taste
and
feel
of
a
fruit
beer
d
well
a
bit
unique
and
good
for
a
change
drinkable
yet
not
very
captivating
d
an
interesting
beer
that
is
worth
trying
cant
see
it
being
a
regular
though
a
really
toned
down
oud
bruin
good
for
beginners
to
the
style
d
overall
a
decent
beer
for
just
drinking
and
not
really
thinking
about
it
if
im
reaching
for
a
sour
oud
bruin
this
will

finish
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
very
good
but
perhaps
a
bit
too
sweet
as
it
warms
some
darker
coffee
aromas
emerge
d
goes
down
so
easy
you
want
more
and
more
drinkability
not
bad
but
not
the
experience
that
i
was
looking
for
in
terms
of
robustness
in
mouth
nose
and
feel
still
its
pretty
refreshing
and
fine
for
the
summer
but
there
are
definitely
some
other
beers
that
provide
much
of
an
experience
drinkable
nonetheless
i
was
just
expecting
more
bite
though
o
not
bad
but
seems
dulled
downpurposefully
held
back
from
its
potential
strong
raspberry
resembles
a
juice
squeeze
in
some
ways
gets
worse
as
i
have
more
lacking
complexity
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
at
best
salvaged
only
by
its
mouthfeel
and
low
abv
i
think
it
would
be
suited
perfectly
for
somebody
just
starting
to
explore
sours
but
a
well
developed
palate
will
find
its
missing
in
many
areas
overall
reminds
me
more
of
ng
old
english
porter
than
the
few
oud
bruins
ive
had
so
far
although
what
do
i
know
needs
more
carbonation
in
the
body
and
its
too
sweet
and
malty
carbonation
is
extremely
high
combined
with
the
acidity
this
makes
for
a
very
prickly
beer
d
the
brew
drank
well
but
was
expecting
more
tartness
considering
it
was
a
flanders
style
beer
i
think
it
needed
more
of
sour
punch
drinkability
while
this
was
an
easydrinking
beer
there
wasnt
much
exciting
going
on
sure
you
could
drink
this
all
night
but
why
it
tastes
thin
and
watered
down
this
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
next
time
ill
stick
with
their
aged
pale
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
a
clear
reddish
dark
brown
a
thin
head
soon
diminishes
to
a
ring
the
nucleating
scores
on
the
glass
support
an
island
of
head
in
the
middle
dark
malt
smells
very
smooth
malts
give
way
to
a
very
moderate
sour
finish
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
for
a
bark
beer
the
carbonation
brightens
it
up
a
bit
verdict
i
have
to
say
petrus
oud
bruin
is
a
bit
of
a
frustrating
beer
to
me
clearly
the
basics
are
in
place
but
the
flavor
profile
is
just
too
thin
like
the
beer
has
been
watered
down
slightly
and
served
extremely
cold
drinkability
what
youd
expect
from
the
style
nice
beer
here
my
first
from
petrus
ill
be
buying
more
not
bad
if
you
dont
have
haandbakk
available
and
it
has
some
character
but
it
doesnt
have
much
of
that
powerful
sweet
tart
oud
bruin
richness
to
it
the
beer
pours
a
clear
reddishbrown
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
with
some
grape
notes
i
dont
get
much
tartness
in
the
smell
the
flavor
is
very
light
tart
grapes
with
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
that
adds
some
sweetness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
decent
beer
but
not
near
as
good
as
the
petrus
aged
pale
which
is
excellent
drinkability
a
nice
sour
with
not
too
much
punch
taste
is
a
little
tart
with
some
dark
fruit
not
real
complex
but
refreshing
mouth
feel
is
rather
effervescent
pretty
drinkable
but
not
worth
seeking
out
again
feel
is
light
and
prickly
with
decent
carbonation
somewhat
dry
though
not
as
much
as
what
most
people
are
saying
just
a
good
easy
drink
that
has
some
nice
flavors
maybe
my
taste
buds
were
overwhelmed
by
a
bottle
of
bashah
i
had
earlier
but
with
an
hour
and
a
glass
of
water
between
the
two
i
doubt
it
im
just
starting
with
sours
and
this
is
very
approachable
everything
seems
very
subtle
drank
in
a
balloon
glass
at
5055deg
drinkability
the
abv
is
almost
session
range
and
the
beer
goes
down
easily
i
was
worried
about
opening
this
750
by
myself
but
quickly
found
the
bottle
empty
taste
of
a
very
muted
brown
ale
i
enjoy
and
nice
brown
ale
and
that
is
really
the
impression
i
received
of
this
beer
not
so
much
a
sour
oud
bruin
most
who
have
had
oud
bruins
would
say
this
does
not
really
match
the
norm
for
the
style
as
such
i
am
giving
it
a
lower
rating
but
it
is
not
a
bad
brown
ale
all
taken
slightly
dry
and
tempered
it
is
not
a
wild
beer
more
like
a
very
slightly
infected
mild
brown
ale
caramel
toffee
match
a
light
oak
presence
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
light
carbonation
a
miss
m
lighter
dry
and
prickly
this
one
along
with
monks
cafe
are
utterly
forgettable
examples
of
this
style
it
was
surprisingly
refreshing
for
a
sour
beer
and
might
be
a
great
gateway
beer
if
you
wanted
to
introduce
your
friends
to
sour
beers
while
i
was
tasting
it
i
was
thinking
that
it
would
go
very
well
with
chocolaty
desserts
particularly
brownies
overall
it
was
a
good
brown
ale
with
a
bit
of
dryness
and
a
hint
of
sourness
lighter
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
giving
a
slightly
creamy
and
fuller
feel
could
be
refreshing
but
the
harshness
from
oak
and
earthy
flavors
detracts
a
bit
d
fantastic
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
the
description
on
my
importers
label
which
is
somewhat
different
than
whats
pictured
was
spot
on
old
brown
ale
aged
in
oak
casks
for
2
years
a
little
of
this
a
little
of
that
the
final
result
being
something
i
could
drink
all
night
without
getting
bored
or
drunk
what
a
great
beer
ill
be
drinking
this
again
for
sure
overall
a
nice
beer
but
if
i
am
looking
for
an
old
bruin
i
am
looking
for
more
than
this
one
still
a
nice
example
and
one
that
is
easily
accessible
a
decent
flavor
again
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
light
crisp
mouthfeel
decent
carbonation
not
boozy
at
allnot
expected
at
5
5
abv
finishes
a
little
dry
with
a
fruit
aftertatse
long
after
each
sip
flavor
has
some
lager
notes
to
it
which
i
find
interesting
oak
and
yeast
are
definitely
prominant
overall
a
decent
beer
and
an
easy
drinker
d
the
sourness
in
this
beer
is
more
laidback
and
enjoyable
imho
its
much
more
drinkable
than
big
sour
beers
such
as
the
petrus
aged
pale
d
drinks
nicely
not
my
favorite
beer
for
the
style
or
sours
in
general
but
still
nice
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
wish
was
a
little
more
extreme
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
unique
flavor
leaves
me
yearning
for
another
drink
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
if
the
cost
was
less
id
get
it
a
lot
taste
is
of
sour
malt
dark
fruit
a
touch
of
spice
and
a
little
caramel
ends
a
little
dry
somewhat
sour
and
a
little
bitter
d
tasty
and
unique
not
as
extreme
as
the
aged
pale
alone
but
it
is
more
refreshing
feeldrink
the
mouth
is
nice
and
smooth
i
can
drink
a
couple
of
these
and
enjoy
them
lot
of
different
flavors
going
on
d
a
good
example
of
the
style
as
well
as
a
good
intro
to
sour
brews
dnot
a
lot
going
on
aroma
is
nice
but
everything
else
is
kind
of
average
would
be
nice
if
this
had
more
of
the
aged
beer
in
the
blend
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
decent
dose
of
malt
and
some
light
tart
notes
easy
drinking
but
doesnt
offer
much
of
a
tart
bite
pleasant
feel
and
quite
well
carbonated
though
a
bit
dense
for
the
style
notes
pretty
good
as
far
as
balancing
the
tartness
if
you
want
a
lot
of
oakiness
there
are
probably
better
choices
its
always
there
but
never
outstanding
i
liked
this
it
just
seemed
a
little
watered
down
flavor
wise
d
a
mild
disappointment
seems
to
lack
any
sort
of
complexity
especially
in
terms
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
one
that
can
easily
be
forgotten
about
especially
when
compared
to
its
flanders
red
and
oud
bruin
counterparts
basically
reminded
me
of
a
session
sour
ale
kind
of
like
a
monks
cafe
i
guess
i
may
have
been
spoiled
by
duchess

2oz
bottle
served

boulevard
chalice
bottle
conditioned
brown
with
some

sparse

not
a
lot
of
carbonation
fruity
aroma
with
some
cherry
a
bit
of
acetic
sourness
in
the
nose
as
well
fairly
sweet
in
the
flavor
however
more
dark
fruit
and
some
caramel
just
a
hint
of
sourness
a
little
metallic
in
the
finish
to
start
but
this
faded
didnt
get
much
wood
flavor
this
didnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
d
good
and
refreshing
would
definitely
like
to
have
more
in
the
future
a
good
and
very
mild
and
approachable
example
of
the
style
definitely
a
good
introduction
to
the
oud
bruin
style
and
maybe
even
to
the
entire
world
of
sours
it
has
complexity
and
sourness
but
only
just
enough
to
let
you
know
it
is
indeed
a
sour
ale
d
fair
to
good
this
is
a
fine
beer
but
it
lacks
that
nice
sweettart
punch
that
i
like
in
this
style
also
it
is
quite
expensive
3
5
d
the
saddest
thing
is
drinking
the
last
sip
d
moderate
complex
really
took
my
time
with
this
one
and
enjoyed
it
id
buy
it
again
but
couldnt
have
more
than
one
per
sitting
a
contemplative
beer
just
kind
of
blah
i
think
i
was
expecting
more
for
some
reason
nothing
bad
though
nothing
i
will
get
again
when
there
are
much
better
versions
easier
to
get
this
beer
came
in
a
variety
six
pack
the
color
looks
a
lot
like
coca
cola
and
has
a
decent
head
the
first
aroma
i
caught
was
of
sweet
apples
the
taste
is
a
little
bit
bitter
with
the
apples
kind
of
in
note
form
and
not
full
flavor
the
flavor
is
slightly
alcoholic
but
i
really
like
this
good
but
one
dimensional
it
poured
with
a
rich
creamy
head
that
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
released
wonderful
scents
one
can
smell
and
taste
the
dried
fruits
raspberries
cherries
citrus
and
a
hint
of
oak
aging
on
the
tongue
the
beer
has
acomplex
flavor
that
lingers
on
the
palate
but
it
is
not
nera
as
tart
as
one
would
expect
goes
down
smoothly
with
nice
texture
d
surprisingly
pretty
light
and
drinkable
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
many
sour
beers
upset
my
stomach
a
little
but
this
one
doesnt
drinkability
this
beer
is
now
in
my
top
10
i
love
the
sourness
combined
with
the
woodiness
i
have
not
had
anything
that
tastes
like
this
before
this
is
my
favorite
sour
beer
post
my
eulogy
trip
to
philadelphia
the
low
abv
means
i
could
have
several
a
overall
a
pleasingly
complex
oud
bruin
i
recommenced
it
all
in
all
a
nice
beer
to
visit
from
time
to
time
drinkable
and
within
sessionable
strength
also
fits
the
definition
of
the
style
very
well
still
worth
a
try
for
sure
but
the
beer
is
not
super
sour
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
sour
its
just
not
tart
there
are
some
cherry
flavors
this
beer
is
sour
and
not
tart
thats
the
best
way
i
can
put
it
it
finishes
comlpetely
it
is
a
palate
cleansing
beer
completely
i
did
not
remember
drinking
it
seconds
after
i
swallowed
drinkability
high
i
had
to
keep
drinking
it
to
analzye
it
and
it
was
gone
in
a
few
minutes
completely
gone
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
a
nice
mouth
feel
hit
all
the
right
places
on
the
palate
before
vaporizing
malty
up
front
but
thinning
at
mid
palate
due
to
the
souring
note
going
into
the
astringent
finish
ok
but
by
no
means
great
glad
ive
had
one
will
not
be
having
another
md
palate
starts
a
little
acidic
and
tart
but
finishes
smooth
medium
body
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
bottle
claims
aged
20
months
but
palate
doesnt
quite
have
synergy
as
thought
not
my
kind
of
thing
d
moderate
alcohol
and
an
effervescent
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
good
but
not
great
so
i
doubt
i
will
have
this
again
at
nearly
4
for
a
330ml
bottle
very
well
balanced
nothing
too
strong
a
hint
sweet
easily
drinkable
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
flanders
oud
bruin
just
a
touch
of
sour
makes
a
nice
balance
drinkability
not
on
my
short
list
but
not
a
bad
beer
appearance
was
a
dark
but
very
carbonated
smells
like
a
flander
with
a
slight
hint
of
sourness
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
initially
dominated
by
very
high
carbonation
slight
sourness
and
then
a
hint
of
molasses
all
taste
dissipates
quickly
a
little
too
thin
for
my
taste
but
generally
drinkable
not
as
rich
and
creamy
as
the
oud
bruins
i
had
years
ago
in
holland
an
interesting
beer
and
for
those
that
like
the
sourness
thing
a
winner
ill
wait
until
i
go
to
belgium
before
i
have
another
d
not
at
all
big
and
not
all
that
complex
this
is
just
very
tasty
and
refreshing
medium
body
with
nice
tingly
carbonation
not
a
difficult
beer
to
drink
at
all
not
bad
seems
pretty
neutral
and
a
good
beginner
oud
bruin
so
it
turned
out
to
be
a
good
choice
for
me
d
the
flavours
are
interesting
but
they
dont
work
for
me
this
is
not
one
of
petrus
best
beers
not
a
scratch
on
the
speciale
drinkability
is
good
the
brew
is
mildly
complex
and
catches
the
palate
off
guard
with
the
dichotomy
between
the
nose
and
palate
that
being
said
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
not
too
sweet
which
works
to
its
benefit
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
multitude
of
fuzzy
creamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
spotty
lacing
as
it
fades
away
it
smells
of
sour
fruit
cherry
apples
and
sweet
grainy
malt
the
taste
is
mild
earthy
sour
fruit
and
roasted
caramel
malt
the
carbonation
is
moderate
the
body
a
little
thin
and
it
finishes
with
some
lingering
fruitiness
an
interesting
beer
but
the
advertised
woodiness
doesnt
really
assert
itself
other
than
in
the
roasted
malt
character
the
fruitiness
becomes
a
tad
cloying
without
the
hops
to
keep
things
honest
overall
a
decent
brown
ale
with
a
minor
sour
essence
pours
a
cloudy
brown
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
colaesque
qualities
on
the
palate
it
is
similar
to
cocacola
as
well
hint
of
oak
vanilla
and
prune
not
much
tartness
or
depth
which
makes
it
a
touch
out
of
balance
leaning
a
bit
too
sweet
enjoyable
enough
beer
but
is
seems
like
a
pretty
tame
oud
bruin
entry
level
stuff
drinkable
but
the
flavors
leave
something
to
be
desired
good
overall
but
not
something
i
would
go
to
great
lengths
to
seek
out
i
think
my
girlfriend
liked
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
did
judging
from
her
smile
drinkability
is
good
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
on
a
hot
day
to
quench
my
thirst
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
nice
transitioning
between
sweet
and
sour
this
adds
up
to
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
decent
flanders
with
a
proper
look
of
dark
red
with
a
mild
murk
and
a
mild
head
smell
of
tart
cherries
and
sour
apples
taste
was
a
subdued
version
of
that
a
bit
boozy
with
a
weak
malt
character
not
much
horizon
in
the
flavor
rather
simple
tart
is
not
assertive
a
tad
sweet
not
much
of
a
wood
present
either
notes
a
really
nice
sour
brown
a
good
intro
to
the
world
of
oud
bruin
not
too
exotic
not
too
extreme
great
balance
with
good
carbonation
levels
and
clean
edges
well
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
this
style
but
im
definitely
not
averse
to
it
and
enjoy
the
various
sour
styles
this
beer
pours
a
dark
but
somewhat
clear
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
beige
head
that
stands
strong
for
some
time
the
aroma
is
a
bit
strange
it
smells
a
bit
like
a
vinegary
small
brown
ale
which
i
guess
it
is
but
it
doesnt
pull
it
off
quite
well
enough
the
aroma
is
interesting
but
a
bit
thin
and
acrid
there
are
some
interesting
fruit
notes
in
it
and
some
malt
nuttiness
but
i
much
prefer
the
flavor
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
refreshing
its
sweet
and
sour
with
a
bit
caramelized
malt
the
fruits
flavors
really
shine
like
lemons
apricots
grapes
and
apples
brightened
up
with
a
dash
of
vinegar
its
a
shame
that
the
bottle
is
so
small
and
relatively
expensive
because
it
seems
like
an
enjoyable
pub
beer
to
drink
for
an
evening
i
like
this
i
rarely
see
this
style
around
much
so
its
always
a
treat
to
give
it
a
try
definitely
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
this
is
the
second
petrus
brew
that
i
have
tried
after
the
petrus
tripel
poured
into
a
delirium
glass
which
produced
a
very
dark
brown
color
the
head
was
minimal
and
there
was
very
little
lace
in
the
glass
like
many
belgian
ales
petrus
gives
off
a
sour
scent
but
this
attribute
is
only
slightly
present
in
the
taste
after
some
initial
sourness
the
beer
quickly
fades
off
and
doesnt
leave
any
distinguishable
mark
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
yet
nothing
spectacular
about
it
either
ever
so
slightly
thin
but
still
smooth
with
acidic
texture
at
the
end
crisp
carbonation
has
moments
of
fluffiness
d
refreshing
tasty
and
a
something
to
it
this
is
a
good
brew
which
i
am
happy
to
drink
a
few
of
mouthfeel
is
nice
the
body
is
not
too
thick
or
too
thin
the
carbonation
gently
massages
the
palate
ahhh
a
pleasurable
beer
complex
without
being
overpowering
could
sit
sip
this
all
day
had
on
tap
at
local
44
in
philly
poured
a
purple
brown
into
a
tulip
with
a
thick
cream
colored
head
smell
was
bitter
fruity
of
raisins
and
bread
taste
was
pungent
and
fruity
similar
to
a
brandy
or
whiskey
mellow
belgian
hops
in
the
finish
complex
beer
definitely
worth
trying
but
nowhere
near
as
interesting
or
tasty
as
some
similar
beers
d
this
one
is
alright
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
not
opposed
to
drinking
one
d
this
is
a
decent
enough
beer
it
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
but
lacked
that
certain
something
the
pushes
a
beer
to
the
next
level
surprisingly
smooth
undeniably
drinkable
restrained
oak
and
acidity
coupled
with
its
slightly
fruitiness
make
it
a
suitable
match
with
say
smoked
fish
or
braised
meat
had
a
bottle
with
a
steak
dinner
in
ghent
appears
a
dark
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
this
beer
was
disappointingly
sweet
like
big
candy
sugar
content
sweetness
with
only
a
bit
of
cocoa
theres
a
toomild
sour
tang
for
the
style
while
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
a
pale
example
for
the
style
still
it
wasnt
bad
with
my
steak
md
i
suppose
the
combination
of
a
lack
of
more
assertive
sour
fruitiness
and
an
additional
unusual
mustiness
maybe
due
to
bottleconditioning
instead
of
just
filtering
as
in
most
other
counterparts
makes
this
ale
stand
out
from
the
crowd
as
an
unusual
example
of
oud
bruin
but
this
can
also
play
against
the
overall
enjoyment
at
the
expense
of
expected
complexity
all
in
all
this
mediumbodied
smoothly
carbonated
ale
is
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
attractive
in
terms
of
overall
performance
d
its
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
is
the
rodenbach
grand
cru
a
flanders
red
ale
and
though
i
love
it
you
cant
drink
to
much
of
it
in
a
sessioni
guess
i
was
expecting
something
similar
i
think
ill
definitely
be
buying
this
one
again
and
i
highly
recommend
it
very
easy
to
drink
and
interesting
enough
to
have
again
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
legitimately
sour
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
as
ive
remembered
others
in
the
style
being
much
more
interesting
nothing
stellar
here
i
love
petrus
aged
pale
think
ill
be
sticking
with
that
hv
drinkability
suffers
because
of
the
fact
that
it
just
isnt
my
cup
of
tea
d
pretty
drinkable
good
acidity
low
abv
pleasant
tartness
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
taste
and
aroma
may
be
just
a
bit
onedimensional
but
it
is
fairly
robust
very
drinkable
and
quite
appetizing
pours
with
a
good
amount
of
head
and
only
a
little
yeast
left
in
the
bottle
its
a
pretty
dark
brownred
darker
than
any
other
of
the
style
ive
had
head
receeds
disappointingly
fast
with
little
to
no
lace
smell
is
light
and
pleasent
cherry
fruits
and
crisp
brett
very
nice
but
very
subtle
taste
is
similar
very
slight
sour
with
cherries
and
fruit
that
doesnt
laste
long
enough
it
is
really
a
teaser
beer
and
really
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
is
a
great
place
to
start
with
this
style
but
i
cant
wait
for
red
poppy
all
in
all
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
but
nothing
amazing
taste
and
aroma
are
fairly
onedimensional
and
not
quite
as
robust
as
i
would
have
hoped
a
nice
sipper
that
kind
of
runs
middle
of
the
road
not
bad
at
all
if
i
really
needed
an
oud
bruin
and
this
one
was
available
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
plus
the
11
2oz
bottle
is
a
convenient
size
pours
a
very
dark
brown
that
glows
red
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
white
and
frothy
but
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
lot
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
seaweed
leather
and
persimmon
the
taste
is
loam
pear
skin
and
salty
tangy
sweat
its
finely
but
not
too
highly
carbonated
rather
thin
in
body
and
is
quite
quenching
perhaps
id
enjoy
this
beer
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
not
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
but
still
is
a
pleasant
drink
feel
is
thin
pronounced
carbonation
but
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
was
ready
for
another
but
only
picked
up
one
d
its
a
good
one
a
nice
version
worth
sipping
for
a
while
ive
seen
more
of
these
bottles
recently
at
whole
foods
so
its
one
i
plan
to
snag
again
soon
for
another
taste
recommended
d
on
the
whole
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
im
not
that
familiar
with
this
style
but
it
does
seem
like
an
interesting
one
not
particularly
complex
to
my
experience
despite
the
wood
barrel
aging
not
too
much
in
the
nose
fruit
spices
and
a
slight
vinegar
taste
is
sweet
red
fruits
up
front
followed
by
a
tartness
and
lingering
sweetness
light
on
the
spices
in
this
one
but
still
pretty
good
overall
a
terrific
little
oud
bruin
treat
definitely
will
have
again
try
with
duck
game
or
good
cheeses
next
time
ill
use
this
in
my
carbonnade
a
la
flamande
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
oak
aged
brews
and
would
not
describe
this
as
a
typical
wood
aged
beer
as
there
are
far
to
many
other
flavors
which
ring
much
more
strongly
boring
slight
head
that
dropped
quickly
minor
ring
around
the
glass
brown
in
color
opaque
no
smell
on
this
one
highly
carbonated
on
the
tongue
taste
is
lightly
sweet
very
small
hint
of
a
sour
on
this
one
likely
due
to
the
barreloak
this
is
drinkable
but
not
something
that
is
highly
appealing
id
rather
have
a
duchess
for
something
similar
so
far
im
not
impressed
with
this
brewery
pretty
drinkable
beer
although
mild
and
not
terribly
complex
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
i
definitely
prefer
petrus
aged
pale
which
is
one
of
the
beers
blended
to
make
this
oud
bruin
this
is
a
great
mild
sour
beer
for
those
who
are
not
into
sours
or
who
would
like
to
experiment
with
sours
or
those
that
are
into
sours
this
is
a
nice
flanders
sour
it
pours
a
nice
brown
with
a
slight
silky
tan
head
it
kind
of
looks
like
a
belgian
dubbel
its
a
very
tasty
drink
and
worth
a
pour
d
at
5
5
abv
this
is
almost
sessionable
was
my
first
beer
of
the
evening
and
paired
it
with
an
appetizer
worked
well
in
that
capacity
i
wanted
to
move
on
to
my
next
beer
but
i
was
enjoying
this
one
so
much
particularly
as
it
got
warm
that
i
took
my
time
clear
brown
pour
with
a
short
tan
head
caramel
oak
cherries
and
funk
in
the
nose
sweet
and
sour
bite
with
oak
malt
and
green
apples
in
the
taste
not
a
really
bretty
beer
more
of
a
sour
mashsour
fruit
combo
without
the
buttery
sweetness
sour
and
dry
finish
the
taste
is
sweet
but
sour
tangy
with
earthy
molasses
elements
yeast
red
wine
and
fruit
almost
like
grape
soda
mixed
with
beer
it
has
a
sweetish
slightly
grainy
finish
its
ok
but
too
sweetsour
for
me
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
beige
head
that
quickly
dissapears
without
any
lacing
strong
aroma
of
oaky
wood
chocolate
maltiness
and
dark
fruit
tart
and
very
sweet
tasting
with
the
oakinees
dominating
and
overpowering
the
other
flavors
more
sour
than
i
prefer
while
theres
a
bit
of
tart
sourness
to
it
theres
a
sweet
burn
aftertaste
i
did
not
find
appealing
almost
like
a
beer
version
of
sweet
and
sour
thin
not
particularly
enjoyable
overall
just
a
nice
semi
sour
brown
ale
that
is
good
to
have
everyonce
in
awhile
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
decent
sized
offwhite
head
from
the
bottle
some
lacing
is
left
in
the
glass
nice
aroma
of
caramel
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
of
wood
flavor
begins
with
a
rich
sweetness
followed
by
a
slightly
sour
finish
solid
full
mouthfeel
a
nice
beer
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wouldnt
buy
more
at
this
point
in
my
beer
adventure
im
going
to
have
to
get
more
used
to
sour
beers
ajh
d
drinkability
is
good
this
one
is
really
smooth
and
refreshing
for
the
style
alcohol
is
very
hard
to
detect
it
hits
some
of
the
typical
flavors
i
expected
for
a
flanders
aged
in
oak
for
20
months
i
have
my
doubts
about
that
since
oak
doesnt
really
come
through
at
all
still
a
good
brew
though
i
thought
this
to
be
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
beer
for
those
who
dig
the
sour
i
would
recommend
it
i
bought
his
bottle
at
beer
mania
in
brussels
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
of
the
style
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
anytime
soon
but
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
the
drink
is
medium
in
body
with
fine
carbonation
and
a
fluffy
feel
quaffable
d
good
drinkability
overall
a
good
example
per
style
my
first
oud
bruin
seems
to
sit
within
the
style
guidelines
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
find
terribly
interesting
either
perhaps
this
is
one
of
those
styles
that
just
doesnt
work
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
will
try
another
of
the
style
at
some
point
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
reupping
for
this
beer
anytime
soon
the
taste
fits
in
well
with
the
style
but
i
feel
that
it
falls
far
short
from
being
an
oak
aged
brew
there
is
a
nice
carbonation
that
works
with
the
beer
not
bad
but
also
not
a
great
brew
ill
stick
to
the
other
beers
in
the
petrus
lineup
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
as
previously
mentioned
petrus
oud
bruin
has
a
dry
finish
the
body
is
medium
on
this
one
carbonation
seems
higher
than
it
actually
is
it
is
very
delicate
and
has
an
unobtrusive
prickliness
to
itnot
scrubbing
and
not
extremely
sharp
instead
delicate
tiny
bubbles
that
are
long
lived
when
held
in
the
mouth
this
is
one
to
pick
up
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
belgian
beer
this
beer
has
turned
me
on
to
a
style
that
i
wouldve
previously
probably
not
even
found
easy
to
drink
nice
delicate
beer
very
refreshing
not
really
heavy
or
even
all
that
dark
tasting
this
is
one
i
could
drink
all
night
the
malty
flavor
makes
this
pretty
interesting
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
almost
as
easy
as
water
this
is
one
of
only
a
few
beers
i
could
honestly
say
i
could
down
a
750
by
myself
easily
except
they
dont
come
that
big
drinkability
this
beer
had
the
same
flavors
over
and
over
again
the
one
new
flavor
that
was
new
was
metallic
rust
and
thats
not
good
at
all
for
me
this
beer
could
have
used
more
sour
fruits
a
little
bit
more
charred
oak
increase
the
sourness
a
bit
and
get
rid
of
the
rust
where
it
stands
its
an
ok
lightly
sour
belgian
beer
its
not
my
favorite
beer
from
petrus
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
rapidly
diminishing
head
and
a
bit
of
aslo
rapidly
diminishing
lacing
very
malty
scent
not
strong
in
any
respect
and
has
a
slight
roasty
aroma
nice
taste
slight
malt
and
slight
fruitytart
tastes
but
every
taste
seems
to
go
away
and
leaves
no
aftertaste
at
all
it
is
quite
smooth
very
quafable
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
one
bottle
sessionable
yes
for
its
low
alcohol
and
thin
body
allow
it
but
would
you
a
passive
beer
and
a
recommended
starter
to
the
flanders
style
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
mind
seeing
it
on
tap
or
at
a
more
reasonable
price
but
certainly
not
exceptional
drinkability
very
smooth
when
drinking
it
down
if
i
were
swilling
it
back
than
i
may
not
have
noticed
the
flaws
so
closely
this
beer
is
a
conundrum
of
inscrutable
potentialities
a
snorter
if
you
will
in
fact
i
would
almost
go
so
far
as
to
label
the
entire
oud
bruin
category
as
such
the
smell
leads
you
in
one
direction
and
the
taste
in
an
entirely
different
one
this
beer
really
is
everything
id
expect
of
an
oud
bruin
its
tasty
interesting
and
perplexing
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
i
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
11
2
oz
bottle
with
no
date
nice
dark
brown
with
no
head
and
no
carbonation
aromas
of
glue
on
leather
and
cinnamon
the
taste
is
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
expected
this
tasted
like
a
brown
ale
with
the
slightest
bit
of
tartness
interesting
overall
i
had
this
beer
after
enjoying
an
earthmonk
this
one
while
still
a
good
beer
pales
in
comparison
it
was
served
in
an
oversize
wine
glass
medium
brown
in
color
with
a
small
light
brown
head
that
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
aroma
was
mostly
dark
fruit
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
i
seemed
to
taste
mostly
cherries
and
caramel
mediumbodied
and
pleasant
worth
trying
at
a
tasting
with
a
group
to
better
understand
how
to
describe
this
beer
a
good
beer
to
sip
and
enjoy
but
one
is
good
enough
for
me
d
on
the
mild
side
and
slightly
boring
with
a
lot
more
fresh
ale
taste
than
other
oud
bruins
i
have
tried
not
much
oak
aromaflavor
for
being
in
oak
for
2
years
an
easy
drinker
but
really
too
tame
in
character
the
beer
just
needs
a
lot
more
of
what
it
already
has
not
bad
certainly
unique
i
tried
this
beer
on
october
27th
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
into
the
glass
with
a
1cm
tannish
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
sour
with
some
nut
hints
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
sour
to
the
tongue
with
some
mild
carbonation
the
flavour
is
sour
with
some
malt
tones
mixed
in
champagne
like
mouthfeel
and
character
with
subtle
sour
fruit
tartness
faintly
sweet
and
finishing
abruptly
dry
like
the
special
a
nice
pallete
cleansing
table
beer
or
sour
edged
session
ale
but
sort
of
a
watered
down
mass
produced
example
of
a
classic
style
drinkability
is
good
and
probably
the
strong
point
about
this
beer
it
isnt
offensive
in
any
way
drinkability
smooth
and
light
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
a
night
worth
a
try
flavors
of
mildly
acidic
tartness
hay
and
white
grapecherry
juice
sourness
is
downplayed
but
the
finish
is
moderately
dry
nonetheless
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
flat
like
a
flanders
oud
bruin
flavored
tea
a
little
disappointing
given
the
attractive
aroma
and
appearance
taste
seems
to
dull
toward
the
end
of
the
glass
next
round
calls
for
something
different
d
alcohol
is
not
a
factor
is
this
almost
sessionable
oud
bruin
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
oud
bruin
especially
after
catching
a
whiff
of
its
wonderful
scent
it
would
be
nice
to
try
to
again
and
see
if
i
had
an
older
and
less
fresh
bottle
worth
trying
if
you
like
oud
bruins
otherwise
there
are
better
choices
out
there
for
your
first
taste
of
this
delicious
and
unique
style
finish
has
unpleasant
sour
funk
sour
should
be
good
but
is
funky
here
d
hmmm
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
this
if
it
werent
for
that
sourness
ive
come
to
love
so
much
i
would
have
scored
it
much
lower
perhaps
petrus
brewed
this
beer
intentionally
this
way
i
feel
like
i
need
to
consume
a
lot
to
get
my
moneys
worth
in
short
its
the
bud
light
of
the
flanders
imo
not
impressed
overall
but
it
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
on
a
hot
day
mouthfeel
lightbodied
and
semicrisp
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
d
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
i
think
i
like
duchesse
de
bourgogne
more
still
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
a
bit
wimpy
for
the
style
but
not
bad
a
bit
too
vinegary
though
has
a
nice
sweet
and
sour
character
not
the
greatest
might
be
a
good
intro
to
the
style
offering
some
decent
malt
but
none
of
the
challenging
aspects
of
a
proper
example
of
the
style
this
is
actually
not
a
bad
oud
bruin
just
nothing
spectacular
ill
admit
that
i
was
given
this
bottle
a
few
months
ago
thanks
joey
but
since
i
wasnt
into
vinegarsour
tasting
beers
i
decided
to
leave
this
one
until
i
developed
a
taste
for
this
type
and
red
poppy
certainly
did
that
for
me
this
one
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
not
too
overpowering
dark
mohogany
color
with
tan
head
the
nose
was
of
earthy
belgian
yeast
and
some
mild
malts
not
very
impressed
here
closer
to
an
english
than
a
belgian
lots
of
dried
fruits
but
very
little
tartness
classic
crisp
but
full
belgian
feel
drinkable
but
not
the
best
example
of
a
wonderfull
style
d
this
is
a
solid
oud
bruin
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
drinking
probably
not
worth
the
price
tag
but
its
still
a
good
example
of
the
style
bottle
conditioned
and
purchased
from
the
ontario
alcohol
monopoly
this
one
pours
a
dark
oak
colour
with
a
quickly
fading
white
head
smells
of
lemon
and
blue
cheese
this
is
quite
promising
i
find
lemon
and
cheese
pairs
nicely
taste
upfront
is
moderately
sour
but
this
is
toned
down
by
aggressive
carbonation
as
the
drink
flattens
the
sour
tone
is
enhanced
and
the
beer
begins
to
resemble
a
red
wine
that
has
started
to
turn
but
in
a
good
way
the
mouthfeel
lets
this
drink
down
as
the
carbonation
is
too
intense
and
overpowers
the
flavour
so
i
found
myself
agitating
my
glass
to
draws
some
of
it
out
d
good
not
great
the
balance
is
a
little
off
imo
as
the
tartness
isnt
there
nice
to
drink
and
easy
at
that
but
i
was
expecting
more
a
good
introductory
beer
to
the
style
though
pours
a
dark
amber
with
little
to
no
head
not
much
to
the
nose
at
first
a
little
more
noticable
sourness
as
it
warms
a
touch
of
vinegar
let
this
beer
warm
up
to
the
specified
temps
taste
is
of
slightly
sour
cherries
minimal
tartness
i
was
not
expecting
a
flanders
style
beer
from
this
one
not
bad
though
a
good
gateway
beer
for
introducing
people
to
the
style
decided
to
pick
this
up
the
other
day
as
i
do
enjoy
the
brown
ales
this
one
poured
to
a
medium
brown
hue
with
a
surprisingly
smallish
head
that
broke
down
very
quickly
and
left
hardly
any
lacing
the
aroma
shows
a
nice
malt
scent
mixed
with
a
slight
sour
character
the
flavors
have
a
little
more
character
to
it
than
the
nose
did
nice
malt
some
fruit
like
flavor
maybe
some
wood
like
flavors
as
well
what
i
really
like
is
the
sourness
which
is
persistent
but
in
no
way
overwhelming
gives
this
brew
a
real
nice
flavor
that
mixes
well
with
the
other
favors
listed
while
not
having
a
very
good
sized
head
it
seems
to
have
ample
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
lots
of
flavors
going
on
that
really
come
out
in
the
taste
very
easy
drinking
not
really
my
thing
to
be
honest
its
more
drinkable
than
stuff
like
rodenbach
grand
cru
but
i
dont
much
care
for
sour
cherries
and
this
has
too
much
of
them
to
warrant
another
purchase
from
me
if
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
give
it
a
shot
it
seems
to
be
a
decent
example
of
the
style
this
is
the
last
from
the
6pack
from
petrus
the
aged
pale
is
by
far
the
winner
on
tap
at
the
trappist
in
oakland
ca
nice
dark

great

cool
sour
wet

blanket
notes
on
the
aroma
that
are
mostly
in
aroma
not
so
much
in
the
actual
taste
pretty
low
carbonation
for
the
style
much
sweeter
in
the
finish
than
you
would
expect
from
the
aroma
nice
complexity
when
you
want
a
balance
of
sweetsour
great
complexity
of
flavors
considering
the
alcohol
content
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
though
not
a
favorite
style
for
me
i
thought
it
was
very
good
i
think
serving
it
with
a
platter
of
cheeses
in
the
springsummer
would
be
a
great
presentation
quite
drinkable
with
the
alcohol
hardly
detectable
a
nice
sour
beer
thats
sessionable
for
sure
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
and
full
of
complex
flavors
i
highly
recommend
it
great
tasting
brew
alongside
of
goudenband
this
one
is
more
mild
i
enjoyed
both
of
them
tremendously
and
would
revisit
this
one
as
well
drinkability
bonne

des

pours
like
a
coke
in
colour
fizz
and
head
has
a
bakery
smell
of
yeast
cinnamon
and
butter
mmmm
it
tastes
delicious
but
has
a
sour
middle
im
not
sure
about
this
one
i
need
another
taste
yep
this
is
very
good
ginger
and
cinnamon
a
good
winter
beer
i
will
buy
this
again
if
the
lcbo
keeps
carrying
it
d
intense
yet
quaffable
and
complex
w
nice
balance
i
found
this
to
a
very
fine
brown
w
high
drinkability
when
poured
from
the
bottle
to
my
belgian
glass
the
beer
displayed
a
clear
brown
color
with
hints
of
ruby
the
head
was
tan
the
aroma
was
sour
with
hints
of
grape
the
one
word
i
can
think
to
describe
it
is
fresh
the
flavor
was
very
balanced
the
light
body
character
gave
it
a
dry
perception
in
my
mouth
there
was
a
definate
grainycereal
flavor
i
feel
like
in
my
opinion
this
was
a
good
example
of
an
old
bruin
i
reviewed
this
beer
with
a
sidebyside
comparison
to
liefmans
old
bruin
and
i
lean
towards
liefmans
in
preference
postscript
funny
i
really
didnt
look
much
at
the
other
reviews
before
writing
purely
by
coincidence
i
gave
this
beer
the
same
breakdown
as
the
reviewer
before
me
strange
tastes
of
sour
fruits
a
bit
wine
like
and
some
spices
very
refreshing
and
has
a
great
mouthfeel
d
a
very
good
oud
bruin
though
i
havent
had
many
of
the
style
not
the
most
robust
funky
sour
ale
nonetheless
but
easy
to
drink
even
though
it
is
kind
of
pricey
at
about
3
50
a
bottle
at
hitimes
dark
brown
colour
that
looks
almost
black
at
some
angles
but
has
burgundy
red
edges
where
a
bright
light
glows
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
one
finger
light
brown
head
bubbles
disappated
quickly
but
the
surface
remained
wispy
with
good
lacing
a
swirl
regenerated
the
head
but
little
by
way
of
visible
carbonation
smells
of
dates
figs
molasses
vanilla
the
taste
is
sweet
and
sour
fruit
cake
malt
tempered
bitterness
nicely
balanced
there
is
a
rich
mouthfeel
that
had
a
very
smooth
texture
and
a
gentle
finish
of
stewed
apples
and
prunes
there
was
a
degree
of
complexity
here
that
i
quite
liked
ill
grab
another
of
these
next
trip
to
the
lcbo
ive
got
12
more
to
try
from
petrus
but
this
one
is
definitely
a
notch
above
the
rest
its
no
westvleteren
8
or
even
close
to
the
other
trappist
dubbels
but
its
no
slouch
drinkability
this
is
my
first
flanders
old
bruin
so
i
dont
know
if
this
is
good
or
not
so
im
just
rating
it
average
by
default
for
drinkability
d
not
very
drinkable
because
of
the
immensity
of
the
sour
melded
with
the
sweet
malt
its
a
strange
flavor
maybe
im
being
unfair
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
brew
and
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
buy
one
thinking
its
going
to
be
horrible
and
maybe
youll
like
it
it
wasnt
bad
but
its
a
bit
mellow
overall
occasionally
along
comes
a
brew
that
seems
to
be
one
thing
but
is
quite
another
this
is
one
of
those
beers
looking
at
the
label
one
might
expect
an
oak
aged
dubbel
or
brown
ale
but
instead
you
have
what
amounts
to
a
flanders
sour
ale
if
youre
not
familiar
with
the
oud
bruin
style
you
will
be
surprised
actually
as
i
have
learned
the
oud
bruin
style
is
a
brown
not
red
flanders
ale
a
slight
distinction
that
makes
more
sense
once
you
actually
taste
the
beer
once
you
figure
out
what
youre
drinking
i
was
seriously
thrown
a
curve
by
the
tartness
you
can
enjoy
this
brew
my
suggestion
is
to
serve
it
cool
not
cold
its
complexities
really
dont
unravel
until
it
warms
even
further
than
the
suggested
50f
otherwise
its
a
pretty
decent
sour
ale
though
too
pricy
for
regular
enjoyment
di
am
digging
this
beer
i
have
no
frame
of
reference
for
the
style
but
it
is
one
i
will
continue
to
explore
when
i
can
this
is
a
unique
offering
one
in
which
you
cannot
judge
the
book
by
its
colour
definitely
let
this
one
warm
up
i
changed
my
rating
from
a
3
5
in
taste
to
4
as
it
warmed
this
beer
had
a
browncopper
color
with
a
thick
head

light
lacing
and
quickly
dissipating
the
aroma
is
sour
and
malty
the
taste
is
fruity
and
sour
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
i
can
say
that
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer

it
is
the
first
ive
had
of
this
style
and
cannot
comment
on
whether
it
is
representative
or
not
the
bottled
variety
seemed
less
metalic
but
there
was
still
a
metalic
aftertaste
i
tried
the
bottle
version
as
it
specifically
said
oak
aged
d
this
was
interesting
and
very
different
id
order
it
again
sweet
and
sour
but
not
as
intense
as
a
fruit
lambic
inoffensive
beer
but
it
just
tastes
saccharine
to
me
i
was
expecting
a
nice
tart
refreshing
brew
but
i
got
a
fountain
drink
pours
a
very
deep
brownish
color
into
a
newer
petrus
glass
i
like
the
new
ones
better
with
a
tan
head
it
has
the
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
the
taste
has
a
dark
fruit
cherries
and
a
very
nice
tartness
that
lingers
a
bit
after
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
dessert
d
lacking
sweet
malt
character
i
am
not
particularly
familiar
with
this
style
so
take
this
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
sour
ales
to
me
are
not
inherently
sessionable
but
to
each
their
own
there
is
some
confusion
on
this
site
as
to
what
style
beer
this
is
and
i
think
that
it
is
also
listed
as
a
belgian
dark
ale
d
i
could
definetly
drink
a
few
of
these
throughout
the
night
or
day
this
will
my
first
time
trying
an
example
of
this
style
i
am
not
too
big
of
a
fan
sour
beers
but
i
still
wanted
to
try
the
style
it
poured
into
a
small
sampler
glass
a
chestnut
brown
complexion
with
a
2
finger
white
heading
that
faded
into
a
small
lacing
in
the
aroma
was
a
soft
sour
presence
with
hints
of
vinegar
cherries
grass
and
other
juicy
fruits
taste
starts
off
a
little
sour
but
quickly
becomes
sweet
then
ends
off
with
a
very
sweet
caramel
flavor
specific
flavors
were
apple
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
style
not
too
sour
not
too
sweet
just
good
all
around
body
is
rather
light
adding
to
the
amazing
drinkability
a
great
refresher
and
a
great
intro
into
sour
beers
for
the
uninitiated
overall
i
was
expecting
a
beer
with
more
flavor
especially
considering
the
style
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
its
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
overall
i
like
it
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
just
bought
it
out
of
curiosity
flavor
is
tart
cherries
backed
by
a
dose
of
cider
vinegar
touch
of
pepper
and
oak
on
the
finish
oelergud
one
of
the
most
disappointing
but
not
worst
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
russet
copper
body
is
mostly
clear
topped
by
a
small
frothy
light
khaki
head
nose
is
a
complex
mix
of
brown
sugar
molasses
vinegar
pepper
sour
cherries
marshmallows
and
vegetable
matter
taste
starts
off
with
tart
slightly
bitter
citrus
peel
toasted
slightly
biscuity
malts
ensue
with
some
definite
sour
cherries
a
hint
of
metal
oak
and
smoke
in
an
otherwise
acidic
mildly
tart
vinegary
finish
moderate
to
light
bodied
ale
with
zesty
carbonation
i
havent
had
many
examples
of
this
style
but
this
seems
like
a
good
iteration
not
quite
as
vinegary
or
sour
as
a
flanders
red
ale
but
still
quirky
and
interesting
still
an
excellent
beer
nothing
really
incredible
or
remarkable
here
glad
i
tried
it
didnt
hate
it
ready
to
move
on
next
33
cl
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
brought
home
from
the
capital
ale
house
in
richmond
it
pours
a
lightly
hazy
rustycopper
that
thins
at
the
bottom
of
the
flute
and
it
has
medium
carbonation
that
leads
up
to
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
never
fully
recedes
and
leaves
nice
sheets
of
lacing
the
bouquet
is
sweet
and
tartsour
with
hints
of
oak
and
mustiness
it
isnt
as
tart
on
the
palate
as
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
but
it
has
some
sourness
with
notes
of
sweet
malts
leafygreen
hops
and
hints
of
red
berries
the
body
is
light
at
first
but
becomes
medium
with
tingly
carbonation
dryness
from
the
tannins
and
a
medium
to
light
finish
not
too
bad
but
as
far
as
sour
ales
go
it
is
quite
mellow
i
wish
it
had
more
sourness
on
the
palate
and
that
it
were
more
robust
in
aroma
and
flavor
i
think
this
is
my
first
experience
with
this
style
and
i
must
say
its
interesting
the
dark
almost
stoutlike
appearance
through
me
for
a
loop
as
i
was
expecting
something
more
along
the
line
of
a
traditional
brown
ale
the
head
was
thick
and
just
slightly
offwhite
as
if
a
hint
of
gray
was
desperately
trying
to
be
noticed
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
a
hint
of
malt
awakened
my
nose
as
i
leaned
forward
to
sniff
the
brew
the
tartness
of
bright
cherries
make
me
take
serious
notice
as
the
first
sip
rested
on
my
tongue
this
is
unlike
any
beer
ive
ever
tasted
and
i
think
i
like
it
so
different
yet
so
delightful
i
also
appreciate
the
smooth
creamy
texture
and
the
way
the
flavor
lingers
for
quite
some
time
sour
beer
eh
ill
have
to
investigate
more
of
this
style
this
is
a
good
sour
if
youre
not
wanting
to
really
get
the
pucker
of
a
flanders
red
cheers
beef
notes
sometimes
i
crave
a
sour
beer
like
this
and
when
i
did
i
used
to
go
to
duchese
i
think
ill
be
going
the
way
of
petrus
now
enjoyable
not
extraordinary
though
one
of
the
most
drinkable
of
the
sour
belgian
ales
easy
to
like
and
probably
a
good
one
to
recommend
to
someone
just
starting
out
with
the
sour
spectrum
of
belgiums
beers
only
big
complaint
is
the
bottle
size
8
4
oz
it
aint
quantity
over
quality
i
know
but
just
when
youre
getting
into
the
beer
its
over
this
is
a
quality
beer
and
i
want
a
few
more
ounces
of
it
d
great
this
is
a
very
drinkable
sour
beer
lacks
the
vomitesque
nature
of
some
of
its
cousins
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
and
excellent
beer
false
d
easy
drinking
and
accessible
could
be
more
flavourful
though
pours
a
clear
dark
burgundy
with
no
head
save
or
a
tiny
ring
around
the
surface
smells
of
cherries
and
wood
with
hints
of
apple
starts
out
sour
in
the
taste
mellows
out
to
a
light
syrupy
sweetness
and
finishes
with
some
more
cherry
sourness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
yet
full
of
complexities
this
one
will
pull
ya
a
few
different
ways
does
it
blend
together
nicely
yes
it
had
my
interest
from
start
to
finish
that
warrants
a
future
purchase
at
a
minimum
5
i
would
love
to
revisit
you
often
but
you
are
an
expensive
date
also
you
can
give
me
heartburn
in
too
large
of
doses
but
like
they
say
youve
never
felt
hurt
til
youve
felt
love
drinks
pretty
good
the
tartness
dryness
make
we
want
to
drink
at
least
one
more
definitely
one
of
those
beers
that
made
me
love
my
visits
in
be
very
funky
out
of
the
norm
opinion
i
think
that
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
guess
that
it
is
a
flanders
brown
and
it
fits
that
category
pretty
well
it
comes
across
as
a
tad
thin
but
that
enhances
its
drinkability
i
like
the
sweet
and
sour
contrast
and
the
fact
that
this
beer
has
some
age
on
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
whole
flavor
profile
i
was
really
careful
not
to
pour
the
sediment
from
the
bottom
as
there
is
quite
a
bit
this
would
have
likely
detracted
since
it
has
some
age
on
it
all
in
all
i
think
that
this
was
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
and
one
that
i
would
like
to
try
again
as
a
fresher
example
overall
it
was
alright
not
an
easy
one
to
keep
drinking
but
a
good
novelty
beer
to
have
every
now
and
then
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
nice
after
dinner
treat
beer
this
is
a
petrus
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
i
am
starting
to
like
the
bittersour
beers
the
petrus
put
out
from
the
label
old
brown
ale
aged
in
oak
casks
for
2
years
the
oak
shows
and
is
counterbalanced
nicely
by
the
tart
fruit
cola
colored
white
head

faint
nose
of
sour
raspberries
maple
syrup
green
vegetation
and
mold

taste
is
initially
malt
then
sour
raspberries
as
one
swallows
medium
body

aftertaste
short
cola
colored
white
head

faint
nose
of
sour
raspberries
maple
syrup
green
vegetation
and
mold

taste
is
initially
malt
then
sour
raspberries
as
one
swallows
medium
body

aftertaste
short
enjoyed
on
tap
at
bryant
lake
bowl
in
minneapolis
my
first
oud
bruin
so
i
cant
compare
to
others
but
ill
look
into
the
style
more
though
they
are
not
very
easy
to
come
by
some
mouthfulls
are
better
than
others
with
this
beer
none
of
the
mouthfulls
are
really
bad
but
i
wouldnt
rate
many
as
great
first
beer
of
the
style
for
me
id
like
to
see
more
i
dont
seem
to
taste
the
oak
oh
well
overall
impression
well
crafted
aged
and
balanced
the
tartsourness
is
balanced
with
the
sweetness
hop
flavor
oak
bitterness
and
the
dryness
definably
worth
trying
great
oud
bruin
this
is
a
good
beer
to
initiate
someone
into
oud
bruins
but
lacks
the
depth
or
complexity
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
quite
light
in
body
goudenband
and
duchesse
are
better
for
sure
but
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
example
simple
clean
not
bad
tase
is
a
light
medley
vinous
fruit
cherry
cordial
and
green
apple
all
pulled
down
by
darker
fruit
tastes
slight
anise
and
a
taste
that
sort
of
reminds
me
of
finnel
despite
the
flavors
described
this
is
a
very
light
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
mouthfeel
is
slick
but
light
i
feel
like
having
this
beer
without
pairing
it
with
some
crazy
food
was
a
waste
it
is
a
great
one
for
the
table
complex
but
easygoing
d
interesting
enjoyable
worth
a
shot
for
sure
dont
know
about
much
after
that
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
again
unless
its
from
the
brewery
overall
a
beer
that
i
much
enjoyed
most
of
all
for
the
aroma
and
it
was
a
serious
steal
when
i
was
visiting
louisville
at
2
25
this
beer
is
a
steal
bjs
for
only
3
95
bottle
a
fantastic
beer
rich
and
aromatic
very
pleasing
for
speacial
occasions
anyway
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
although
nothing
special
aftertaste
is
pleasantly
fruity
without
being
overpowering
taste
the
oak
flavors
come
out
more
than
the
aroma
led
me
to
believe
they
would
theres
a
nice
sour
fruitiness
with
cherries
plums
and
maybe
a
touch
of
raspberries
its
a
bit
drying
in
the
finish
due
to
the
oak
barrel
aging
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
even
with
the
dryness
im
still
on
the
fence
with
this
one
its
a
simple
sour
beer
but
then
theres
that
metallic
finish
its
not
my
favorite
but
i
didnt
have
any
trouble
finishing
it
i
thought
this
was
an
amazing
beer
for
my
first
oud
bruin
im
impressed
an
look
foward
to
trying
more
in
this
style
drinkability
hm
of
course
liking
the
beer
helps
this
category
so
i
have
to
vote
low
since
it
didnt
go
down
easy
pours
a
great
darkened
brown
hue
into
the
signature
petrus
goblet
notes
of
translucent
ruby
red
at
the
base
of
the
glass
makes
a
tanned
creamy
colored
half
inch
crown
that
fades
into
a
thin
layer
of
long
lasting
finely
packed
bubbles
funky
tart
barnyard
aromas
sour
cherries
slightly
vinegary
malty
caramel
and
bittersweet
chocolate
almost
soured
chocolate
flavors
with
a
subtle
hint
of
tart
lemony
citrus
and
spices
but
is
almost
metallic
in
the
finish
light
to
medium
palate
very
crisp
strong
peppery
carbonation
with
a
very
dry
finish
looks
good
smells
good
and
feels
good
on
the
palate
but
the
flavor
is
a
let
down
compared
to
the
nose
tasty
but
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
more
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
foamy
head
leaving
a
little
bit
of
sticky
lacing
smells
funky
sour
overripe
fruit
apples
pears
plums
and
grapes
taste
is
pretty
good
sour
fruit
wood
and
even
a
cola
like
flavor
mixed
in
there
as
well
light
body
moderate
carbonation
very
dry
cloyingly
dry
in
the
finish
which
really
hurts
this
it
could
be
much
better
otherwise
pours
a
deep
clear
copper
color
with
a
finger
width
lighttan
cap
that
dissipated
to
thin
lacings
along
surface
malty
sweet
aroma
with
sour
esters
raisins
brown
sugar
and
spice
alcohol
is
in
the
nose
nice
rich
bouquet
the
flavor
almost
transforms
through
noticeably
different
flavors
flavor
is
brown
sugar
sweetness
turning
into
sour
cherry
then
brightens
to
a
ripe
fruit
with
hint
of
a
banana
finish
bitterness
is
very
mellow
woodsy
throughout
it
has
mediumlight
body
with
medium
carbonation
and
finishes
with
a
earthyoak
dryness
very
intriguing
beer
that
can
be
enjoyably
sipped
and
savored
this
is
my
first
experience
with
a
sour
ale
but
will
definitely
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
like
this
ut
vivat
crescat
floreat
the
beer
makes
good
its
escape
pouring
a
deep
clear
brown
the
head
is
bountiful
creamy
in
texture
and
a
winsome
light
tan
in
color
upon
its
dematerialization
the
lace
formed
is
a
tight
seal
upon
the
glass
nose
is
musty
with
hints
of
molasses
malt
and
a
bit
of
citrus
like
tartness
start
is
mild
in
sweetness
fair
to
middling
grain
presence
and
the
top
light
to
moderate
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
sternly
acidic
tart
quite
dry
and
a
magnificent
beer
a
light
and
pleasingly
quenching
drink
somewhere
between
the
belgian
brown
ale
and
sour
red
ale
styles
a
deep
brown
color
with
creamy
head
smells
of
malty
chocolate
and
raisins
mellow
and
calm
rich
but
mellow
rather
neutral
flavors
for
the
most
part
were
a
slight
disappointment
very
smooth
i
was
expecting
more
flavors
maybe
ive
had
too
many
american
ipas
to
appreciate
this
subtle
beer
the
color
is
a
reddish
brown
very
clear
but
dark
there
is
a
decent
head
of
foam
that
quickly
reduces
to
a
thick
ring
around
the
inside
of
the
glass
i
can
immediately
smell
the
storng
fruity
aroma
of
red
wine
after
pouring
the
taste
is
very
fruity
and
tangy
like
cherries
or
raisins
the
sourness
lingers
a
bit
but
there
is
virtually
no
bitterness
at
all
this
one
reminds
me
of
kriek
beer
its
quite
thin
and
adequately
bubbly
on
the
palate
the
overall
drinkablility
is
suprisingly
good
despite
the
sourness
and
acidity
this
is
a
smooth
easy
to
drink
beer
pours
to
a
nice
dark
brown
with
a
thin
head
with
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
a
bit
acidic
but
not
too
offensive
taste
is
quite
acidic
flavors
somewhat
resemble
malt
and
wine
mouthfeel
is
decent
no
excessive
carbonation
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
isnt
too
bad
would
be
better
if
it
was
not
so
acidic
though
i
think
one
of
these
is
enough
not
that
theres
a
high
abv
but
the
overwhelming
tastes
of
the
sour
fruits
and
alcohol
combined
with
a
puckering
dry
mouthfeel
makes
this
a
one
a
night
beer
this
brew
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
billowing
white
head
the
aroma
tart
and
sour
but
rather
mild
the
taste
is
also
rather
mild
there
is
some
sourness
but
really
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
okay
however
i
do
not
think
i
will
drink
it
again
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
and
certainly
a
style
id
like
to
try
again
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
with
this
guy
this
brew
was
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
had
never
heard
of
it
or
tried
anything
in
this
style
if
you
come
across
it
and
want
to
try
something
new
i
would
highly
recommend
it
wow
i
had
no
clue
what
to
expect
with
this
one
i
had
always
wanted
to
try
it
out
and
just
now
got
around
to
it
it
poured
a
redbronzebrown
colour
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
head
of
tightly
knit
off
white
foam
the
smell
is
a
dry
tart
like
smell
if
that
makes
any
sense
very
sour
and
musty
the
taste
too
in
fact
this
thing
reminds
me
alot
of
a
lambic
or
a
saison
the
mouth
feel
was
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
finishing
with
a
bit
of
a
dryness
this
brew
is
just
all
around
good
if
youre
a
fan
of
lambics
and
saisons
and
such
d
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
style
my
first
oud
bruin
poured
out
to
a
hazy
brown
amber
red
color
with
a
short
lived
head
and
some
lacing
inside
the
glass
medium
high
carbonation
aroma
of
vinegar
dark
fruits
and
flat
malt
are
unobtrusive
to
the
drinker
taste
was
slightly
bland
and
flat
flavors
of
malt
are
weak
and
distant
sourness
is
present
but
noticeable
degraded
likely
to
the
ageing
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
watery
but
not
undesireable
considering
the
other
aspects
and
qualities
of
this
brew
average
drinkability
as
this
brew
is
not
bad
but
i
dont
really
think
its
got
a
whole
lot
to
offer
i
may
not
be
revisiting
this
brew
soon
but
that
doesnt
make
it
bad
worthy
of
a
sampling
drinkability
i
like
it
i
like
goudenband
better
but
this
is
still
good
not
as
big
but
easier
to
drink
very
nice
enjoy
please
no
complaints
about
the
mouthfeel
that
i
can
recall
fairly
low
carbonation
perfectly
agreeable
same
for
drinkability
overall
a
great
beer
not
one
to
be
taken
lightly
or
rushed
but
it
rewards
a
pensive
consumption
di
dont
know
if
the
long
aging
process
really
mellowed
this
beer
but
there
is
not
a
lot
of
complexity
i
believe
most
flanders
browns
are
not
usually
aged
in
oak
but
it
makes
this
one
very
smooth
and
drinkable
however
a
lot
of
the
malt
profile
is
just
not
there
drinkability
not
overly
sour
but
has
enough
of
a
sour
kick
to
provide
an
introduction
to
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
less
than
medium
but
it
works
with
the
citric
flavors
quite
drinkable
especially
during
this
summers
never
ending
heat
thin
offwhite
foamy
head
atop
a
dark
reddish
brown
beer
vinous
aroma
along
with
dark
cherries
sour
and
chocolate
notes
generally
tasted
of
grapes
and
perhaps
blasamic
vinegar
dark
cherry
juice
flavor
as
well
this
beer
was
light
in
the
mouth
but
refreshing
a
very
good
beer
it
pours
a
nice
rubyinfused
brown
color
with
a
very
light
coating
over
the
brew
the
nose
is
nice
sour
cherries
light
woody
tannin
light
creamyness
very
nice
the
flavor
is
disappointing
where
is
the
sour
where
is
the
flavor
in
general
it
is
rather
bland
i
get
a
very
light
cherry
and
a
light
sour
but
it
just
lacks
the
kick
i
want
boo
the
feel
is
a
light
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
wish
this
had
a
better
flavor
the
nose
just
teases
me
with
anticipation
that
the
flavor
never
delivers
pours
a
rubied
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
falls
fast
and
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sour
with
some
fruit
tones
and
a
little
sweet
maybe
a
touch
of
vegetable
the
flavor
is
odd
not
what
i
expect
from
an
old
brown
the
sour
really
isnt
there
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
hints
of
fruit
but
i
get
a
lot
of
the
vegetable
character
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
its
not
what
i
want
to
taste
the
body
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
ok
drinkability
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
for
a
reasonable
price
3
50
was
a
bit
steep
when
i
can
get
the
duchesse
for
2
99
still
not
bad
pours
brownish
red
with
virtually
no
head
but
a
little
bit
of
lace
smells
sour
but
with
a
malty
sweet
aroma
doesnt
make
sense
but
thats
what
i
smelled
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
sour
middle
thats
not
overpowering
body
is
rather
full
with
good
carbonation
a
pretty
decent
beer
although
not
really
my
style
thanks
drjay
pours
a
deep
mud
brown
colour
with
a
decent
enough
head
id
estimate
710
of
foam
with
whisps
of
lace
here
and
their
the
smell
is
sweet
malty
and
a
bit
cheesy
im
assuming
from
the
yeast
the
taste
is
simply
too
cheesy
for
me
is
the
yeast
strain
okay
it
reminds
me
of
velveeta
i
dont
like
it
asides
from
that
their
is
a
definite
sweet
and
sour
taste
malty
with
a
bittering
earthy
and
cheesy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
weak
drinkable
perhaps
if
you
like
cheese
if
not
i
wouldnt
bother
trying
this
beer
the
other
two
petrus
products
ive
had
were
considerably
better
the
smell
is
malty
and
somewhat
sour
bits
of
oak
come
through
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
sour
malts
also
come
through
strong
up
front
but
seem
to
fall
apart
bringing
up
a
thin
body
the
drinkability
is
decent
drinkability

goes
down
pretty
easy
for
a
belgian
interesting
complex
and
smooth
this
would
be
a
good
stepping
stone
for
someone
who
like
the
normal
trappist
fare
and
wanted
to
move
towards
lambics
it
is
sour
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
this
is
my
first
oud
bruin
and
i
enjoyed
it
but
not
enough
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
others
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
and
crisp
rolls
over
the
palate
nicely
with
good
carbonation
this
8
4oz
bottle
is
a
tease
i
could
easily
go
for
a
750
of
this
stuff
incredibly
drinkable
and
tasty
i
will
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
recommended
like
chopping
wood
this
cream
hairy
beer
fills
your
head
with
scents
of
old
sap
fresh
fungus
ginger
root
and
decay
citrus
zest
and
vanilla
escort
a
tart
and
fizzy
mouthful
down
a
bit
weighty
particularly
when
compared
to
its
stronger
sibling
the
aged
pale
but
tasty
nonetheless
happy
to
get
to
sample
this
brew
on
tap
at
the
collins
bar
in
nyc
pours
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
on
the
edges
the
nose
was
quite
malty
with
also
a
hint
of
must
carboantion
seems
low
with
a
very
slight
head
developed
and
limited
lacing
malt
sweetness
up
front
initially
then
mid
way
lactic
sourness
picked
up
also
a
hint
of
cherry
and
vanilla
not
much
yeast
or
hops
characteristics
involved
in
the
mix
basically
a
malty
belgian
with
a
sour
undertone
eh
not
really
for
me
id
classify
this
one
as
a
middle
of
the
road
belgian
worth
a
try
but
not
of
much
more
interest
dont
let
the
brown
in
the
name
fool
you
as
it
is
sometimes
listed
as
petrus
brown
the
nose
has
an
amazing
blend
of
soft
malt
hints
and
big
musty
earth
hits
the
mouthfeel
is
active
but
not
overpowering
the
taste
is
tart
and
bold
but
balanced
enough
not
to
be
onenoted
the
yeast
is
wild
complex
and
inviting
the
finish
is
simple
enough
to
have
you
going
back
for
more
not
for
everyone
but
definitely
for
me
250
ml
brown
bottle
with
best
before
date
printed
clearly
on
the
front
label
theres
no
question
that
old
brown
grew
on
me
from
first
sip
to
last
however
it
wasnt
quite
able
to
win
me
over
by
the
end
my
expectations
were
probably
both
high
and
misplaced
its
much
more
delicate
and
subtle
than
anticipated
but
even
so
i
think
that
ive
given
it
a
fair
shake
it
was
interesting
and
was
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
but
it
probably
isnt
a
beer
that
ill
look
for
again
poured
with
a
big
light
coffe
colored
head
that
fades
to
a
skim
covering
a
deep
brown
red
body
that
is
clear
around
the
edges
and
hazymurky
in
the
middle
soft
sourness
with
of
a
vinious
quality
in
the
aroma
weel
carbonated
witha
average
mouthfeel
carbonation
sleanse
nicely
against
the
mild
soury
tart
flavors
and
then
seems
to
explode
in
your
mouth
with
a
release
of
flavor
sour
chaacter
seems
good
although
a
bit
restrained
for
me
still
worth
a
shot
if
you
have
never
tried
oud
bruins
before
pours
a
medium
brown
relatively
clear
with
a
minor
offwhite
head
that
quickly
collapses
ruby
notes
against
the
light
aroma
sour
malty
slightly
sweet
fresh
brown
ale
raisins
flavor
sharp
off
notes
that
i
cant
place
but
it
wasnt
pleasant
it
has
the
slightly
sour
flavor
that
i
love
in
some
other
oud
bruins
and
similar
beers
but
here
is
jsut
isnt
right
cant
recommend
this
one
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
as
suggested
in
the
title
this
beer
is
brown
very
brown
with
no
head
barely
seethrough
the
smell
is
very
reminiscent
of
wine
or
grapejuice
and
not
very
reminiscent
of
beer
tastes
very
grapey
very
very
grapey
theres
a
bit
of
malt
noticable
but
it
really
isnt
very
prominent
and
i
dont
taste
the
hops
in
there
at
all
seems
to
be
a
slight
alcohol
taste
not
in
a
bad
way
though
i
didnt
know
this
beer
was
only
5
5
abv
hmmm
very
watery
and
light
mouthfeel
this
beer
definately
challenges
my
definition
of
beer
and
my
impression
of
what
a
beer
should
be
there
really
are
a
vast
array
of
styles
out
there
and
this
one
is
pretty
new
to
me
definately
expanded
my
beer
palate
with
this
one
but
im
not
sure
i
really
liked
this
beer
very
much
poured
a
dark
brownish
red
with
a
flufffy
cream
head
good
retention
and
beautiful
rings
of
lacing
aroma
reminiscent
of
red
wine
berries
and
very
tart
taste
was
sour
with
hints
of
berries
malty
sweetness
mid
sip
and
ends
dry
creamy
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
sour
but
not
to
the
point
where
it
makes
you
cringe
pours
an
opaque
brown
with
a
thick
offwhite
slightly
orange
head
the
laces
wonderfully
rather
effervescent
aroma
of
wild
yeasts
and
some
citrus
this
is
going
to
be
sour
taste
was
a
refreshingly
tart
with
a
nice
slightly
hoppy
finish
not
nearly
as
sour
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
and
has
a
nice
light
mouthfeel
this
is
new
style
for
me
and
i
was
very
pleasently
surprised
id
drink
this
all
night
if
i
had
more
ill
be
buying
this
again
and
serving
it
to
friends
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
malty
scent
that
boasts
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
along
with
belgian
ale
yeast
it
is
very
refreshing
and
fruity
you
can
smell
hints
of
the
oak
barrels
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
very
refreshingly
fruity
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
yeasty
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
drinking
brown
ale
it
has
everything
pours
a
deep
amber
color
with
a
big
foamy
off
white
head
leaving
nice
wisps
of
lace
the
aroma
is
tart
and
floral
with
some
sweet
malt
and
vinagery
notes
the
taste
is
a
rich
and
complex
mix
of
malt
notes
and
oaky
tartness
theres
some
iron
tannins
and
citrus
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thick
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
crisp
beer
its
not
as
sour
as
rodenbach
but
its
still
really
good
lasting
and
slightly
brownish
head
on
a
very
dark
mahogany
color
that
looks
ruby
against
the
light
the
first
impression
in
the
smell
is
of
vinegar
but
a
bit
soft
maybe
more
like
balsamic
vinegar
the
tartness
is
not
overwhelming
and
rather
combined
with
some
light
citric
notes
hints
of
caramel
too
the
taste
confirms
this
first
perception
oud
bruin
it
is
but
somehow
subdued
or
attenuated
the
winy
oaky
tart
aspect
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
it
kisses
you
on
the
lips
the
finish
is
a
bit
sharper
but
still
very
balanced
some
biscuity
and
even
chocolaty
notes
appear
maybe
a
hint
of
sweet
fried
plantain
at
one
point
with
a
candy
like
sweetness
the
light
soda
taste
reminds
me
a
belgian
stout
hops
get
noticeable
if
you
think
about
them
adding
some
thickness
but
no
strong
bitterness
the
body
is
quite
consistent
for
the
style
enjoyably
round
i
could
have
enjoyed
more
than
this
25cl
bottle
ive
heard
some
nice
things
about
petrus
so
its
about
time
that
ive
finally
tried
one
to
say
that
it
was
interesting
would
be
an
understatement
i
made
the
mistake
of
pouring
this
beer
way
to
cold
i
am
guessing
around
38
40
degrees
even
so
it
poured
a
flat
brown
with
absolutely
no
head
ive
never
seen
anything
like
this
before
there
were
even
no
bubbles
around
the
edge
smell
was
slightly
tart
i
struggled
to
pick
up
any
other
details
initial
taste
was
what
a
suspected
a
slight
tartness
surrounded
by
a
sweet
nutty
maltiness
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
bit
stale
but
overall
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
which
ill
try
again
if
only
i
could
get
my
hands
on
their
pale
pours
out
a
dark
amber
nearly
brown
ale
with
a
creamy
loking
dark
beige
head
the
aroma
of
sour
fruit
and
spices
rise
up
from
the
glass
the
sour
characteristic
jumps
all
over
your
mouth
at
the
start
of
the
taste
followed
by
a
nice
smooth
sweet
lightly
malty
finish
the
sourness
is
the
only
reason
for
the
lower
drinkability
score
8
4
oz
bottle
picked
up
from
riverside
as
part
of
a
mixed
sixer
the
appearance
is
that
of
a
standard
brown
ale
a
rubytinged
translucent
brown
the
head
and
retention
is
decent
although
it
eventually
recedes
into
nothing
the
smell
is
very
nice
vinous
and
sour
hints
of
brandy
and
cherry
juice
and
oak
yes
oak
wow
this
beer
is
not
what
i
expected
it
all
it
almost
has
the
tartness
of
a
lambic
its
nice
and
tart
with
a
sour
cherry
taste
accompanied
by
a
bit
of
an
earthy
flavor
the
finish
is
a
sprinkling
of
a
dull
spicy
hop
and
woodiness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slick
with
very
subtle
carbonation
i
enjoy
these
particular
flavors
a
lot
in
beer
so
im
a
fan
of
this
one
ill
definitely
pick
it
up
again
very
good
beer
i
would
describe
this
as
a
session
sour
beer
a
bit
of
sourness
but
not
an
incredible
amount
tends
to
be
watery
in
the
mouthfeel
but
not
too
bad
flavorful
came
with
a
nice
head
and
a
lasting
lace
again
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
with
a
somewhat
hearty
sausage
centered
meal
actually
i
did
just
that
this
brew
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
only
the
slightest
mahogony
hue
a
thin
white
head
forms
and
leaves
only
a
tiny
lace
aromas
are
very
wine
like
with
a
tart
overtone
and
a
cherry
finish
that
is
quite
apparant
flavors
to
this
brew
to
me
are
quite
similiar
to
a
flemish
red
sour
ale
initially
there
is
a
burst
of
sweet
vinous
grapes
and
cherries
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
tannins
following
this
brew
takes
a
turn
towards
being
decently
pungent
tart
and
sour
with
a
slight
oak
tone
in
the
mix
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
finish
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
slight
spice
a
bit
of
malt
a
strong
grape
like
flavor
and
a
slight
sourness
right
at
the
end
there
is
also
a
warm
finishing
alcohol
tone
overall
this
brew
is
quite
complex
quite
smooth
and
at
the
same
time
has
a
nice
zinging
carbonation
definetly
a
nice
try
if
you
can
find
it
pretty
drinkable
really
dry
enough
to
never
be
cloying
yet
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
interested
pours
out
a
brownish
red
with
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
smell
was
surprisingly
nondescript
i
really
couldnt
make
out
any
discernable
aromas
other
than
malt
taste
was
almost
nonexistent
extremely
dissapointing
im
hoping
i
just
got
a
runt
of
the
litter
i
could
hardly
get
through
this
one
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
beer
has
some
interesting
facets
good
mouthfeel
and
an
evolving
taste

plus

glass

a
slightly
cloudy
deep
redbrown
aromas
are
articulated
cherrygraperaisin
and
a
slight
alcohol
wisp
starts
creamy
right
off
the
body
is
remarkably
clean
not
viscous
for
such
a
strong
smelling
tasting
ale
it
runs
the
gamut
grapes
cherries
raisins
some
toffee
and
all
in
balance
with
this
incredible
souring
that
is
not
overly
pronounced
not
sweet
not
sour
lovely
fruit
tastes
and
a
great
finish
of
sweetsour
fruits
with
a
nice
smoky
oak
finish
a
nice
specialty
drink
from
belgium
i
passed
on
pouring
it
into
tulip
stemware
and
used
my
small
hoegaarden
glass
instead
in
doing
so
i
managed
to
get
a
beautiful
large
offwhite
head
on
the
pour
thick
and
creamy
very
dense
it
leaves
a
decent
sized
cap
all
the
way
down
the
glass
and
a
fair
amount
of
sticky
lacing
the
body
is
a
deep
murky
walnut
colour
but
when
held
up
to
direct
light
it
transforms
into
a
stunning
clear
cherry
oak
hue
an
absolutely
enchanting
work
of
alchemy
sour
cherry
immdeiately
hits
me
from
the
aroma
dates
and
currents
and
a
vinuous
quality
to
it
malty
dried
fruit
appear
first
in
the
flavour
but
is
soon
overtaken
by
an
undercurrent
of
sour
cherry
all
the
way
to
the
finish
where
a
more
black
current
flavour
rounds
out
on
the
aftertaste
rounding
the
edges
of
the
sharp
acidity
light
creamy
mouthfeel
but
the
jaggedness
of
the
acidity
doesnt
appeal
to
me
that
much
i
can
now
see
how
a
wine
glass
may
be
more
ideal
to
serve
this
in
for
more
than
one
reason
would
make
a
lovely
after
dinner
drink
but
i
couldnt
see
having
more
than
one
in
any
sitting
even
the
250
ml
serving
seems
a
little
much
for
me
i
could
be
content
to
hold
the
glass
up
to
the
light
and
gaze
at
it
all
day
and
slowly
work
on
it
overall
an
easy
to
approach
take
on
the
oud
bruin
while
it
lacks
the
overall
complexity
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
it
still
does
a
palate
good
this
was
a
dark
reddish
brown
beer
with
very
little
head
the
head
that
did
apear
dissipated
quickly
the
smells
of
red
wine
and
cider
stood
out
the
flavor
was
sweet
and
malty
but
not
very
flavorful
the
oak
barrel
aging
was
evident
it
was
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
all
in
all
it
is
a
good
beer
its
just
not
as
complex
or
interesting
as
i
had
been
hoping
for
interesting
beer
to
sip
and
review
just
what
i
imagined
it
to
be
from
reading
about
these
oddball
beers
not
really
sure
what
to
drink
it
with
or
when
to
drink
it
1
75

lots
of

standard
deviation
in
complexity
clear
ruby
brown
body
with
a
sticky
offwhite
head
aroma
is
balsamic
with
almost
no
barrel
character
though
which
annoys
me
when
you
display
them
on
the
label
bready
yeasty
taste
is
a
little
bland
very
short
aftertaste
restrained
sourness
and
a
little
empty
i
came
close
to
writing
plastic
also
but
thats
pushing
it
far
bitter
finish
medium
body
creamy
and
biting
too
much
actually
this
may
be
the
only
unremarkable
beer
of
the
day
but
trust
me
that
youre
in
for
something
with
their
aged
pale
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
the
caramel
and
mild
sour
tones
lasted
long
after
swallowing
this
was
medium
bodied
and
the
most
drinkable
bruin
i
have
had
especially
since
this
was
on
tap
exciting

last

and
some
sour

the
taste

refreshingly
tart
but
not
overdone
or
puckering
detect
various
things
in
this
beer

cherry
fruit
some

malt
sweetness
and
a
subtle

texture
the
body
is
thin
and
light
but
remains
flavorful
a
bit
of
a
sour
bitter
finish
pleasant
and
enjoyable
lightly
acidic
with
a
sweet
malt
center
and
a
bit
of
rustic
fruit
finishes
off
dry
with
a
refreshing
sour
twang

lingers

to
take

mellow
with
strong
hints

and
a
dopple
bock
but
doesnt
go
either
direction
it
has
a
light
oily
feel
to
it
a
very
interesting
beer
i
think
i
will
have
to
try
this
again
just
to
further
explore
the
many
tastes
it
gives
it
seems
every
drink
brings
out
a
little
of
something
else
the
light
tastes
and
low
alcohol
5
5
abv
per
the
bottle
make
it
something
you
could
drink
several
of
poured
a
dark
red
brew
with
a
nice
head
aroma
of
cherry
probably
from
coming
from
the
oak
with
acidic
taste
body
is
a
bit
light
and
no
complexity
i
would
have
appreciated
a
bit
more
spice
or
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
very
average
oud
brun
and
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
anytime
soon
drinkablilty
better
than
the
triple
and
speciale
not
bad
when
poured
it
showed
a
medium
amber
brown
with
very
little
foam
the
smell
of
a
spicy
hop
filled
my
nose
which
was
the
tops
of
this
beer
the
taste
was
of
a
tart
sour
beer
that
had
be
aged
to
long
and
saw
the
sink
drain
before
the
first
sip
settled
on
my
palate
blah
what
an
awful
beer
to
put
on
the
market
one
on
my
10
most
awful
beers
on
my
list
this
beer
is
amazing
i
want
more
too
sour
for
my
liking
and
too
close
in
character
to
a
cider
not
something
id
share
with
my
friends
mouthfeel
has
a
syrupy
cling
as
well
which
seems
to
be
its
only
drawback
imho
rich
copperybrown
color
with
fluffy
light
tan
head
globule
yeast
cloud
left
in
suspension
tart
and
sour
aromas
mixed
with
a
bit
of
notfullyripened
bing
cherry
almost
like
opening
a
big
bag
of
sour
patch
kids
at
the
movie
theatre
sweet
malty
and
a
touch
sour
in
the
taste
the
faintest
taste
of
a
mineral
based
water
in
there
too
the
aromas
definitely
bigger
on
the
sour
note
than
the
taste
oak
barrel
aging
is
most
prevalent
oak
is
pourous
and
allows
oxygen
to
pass
through
which
in
essence
adversely
affects
beer
in
a
negatively
way
it
subsequentially
creates
lactic
acid
which
could
be
a
serious
offflavor
in
most
beers
but
a
flemish
brownred
is
supposed
to
be
this
way
this
example
is
a
closetoperfect
style
of
this
beer
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
on
draft
but
i
feel
the
bottle
has
a
slight
edge
very
fine
brew
hazy
garnet
hue
thin
but
persistent
light
beige
head
leaves
lace
waft
of
lacto
fermented
prune
juice
like
tartness
hits
the
nose
upfront
acidity
tapers
quickly
in
aroma
yielding
to
a
mellow
suggestion
of
molasses
sweetened
pear
cider
and
trace
notes
of
tannic
oak
pleasant
but
a
touch
one
dimensional
aromawise
snap
of
acetic
tartness
initially
in
flavor
softens
abruptly
and
couples
with
caramelized
dark
candi
sugar
sweetness
to
lend
a
gentle
sweetsour
citric
character
understated
notes
of
dry
cocoa
and
raisin
surface
mid
palate
bolstering
malt
and
fruit
character
respectively
lightly
bodied
overall
but
sufficiently
dextrinous
in
mouthfeel
to
lend
an
agreeably
soft
mouthfeel
finishes
slightly
savory
with
fleeting
notes
of
wood
and
salt
a
relatively
simple
but
enjoyable
old
brown
shallow
in
acidity
but
refreshing
and

on
the

blandly
sweet
finish
drinkability

ill
stick
with
the
aged

this
is

expected
it

aftertaste
is
vinous
and
a
little
malty
note
there
was
a
lot
of
soild
yucky
looking
sediments
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
old
beer
or
natural
for
this
beer
need
to
retaste
this
beer
was
light
bodied
had
no
nose
and
had
a
slightly
nutty
flavor
id
recommend
looking
at
reviews
for
others
in
this
style
if
youre
interested
in
trying
it
this
beer
is
a
murky
brown
to
amber
in
color
topped
by
a
thin
wispy
head
smells
tart
and
vinuous
the
first
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
lightly
sour
not
as
much
as
i
was
expecting
from
this
beer
a
fairly
dry
beer
as
well
at
first
when
cold
there
is
not
too
much
flavor
it
is
lightly
carbonated
with
notes
of
sour
plum
in
it
as
it
warms
up
it
does
become
slightly
more
sour
as
well
and
it
becomes
a
bit
fuller
in
the
mouth
overall
a
fairly
simplistic
version
of
a
sour
flemish
ale
source
liquid
solutions
even
subtle
cherry
juice
flavors
together
with
burned
graham
crackers
chimney
and
rye
cracker
tease
lightly
until
the
alltoosoon
finish
of
mineral
water
flushes
the
palate
maybe
im
a
sucker
for
the
style
but
its
a
good
beer
watered
down
vis
a
vis
rodenbach
or
liefmans
but
soulful
nevertheless
taste
sweet
and
malty
not
very
bitter
and
not
to
spicy
with
a
hint
of
citrus
a
bit
woody
making
the
beer
nice
and
flavorful
the
only
down
fall
is
that
its
a
bit
too
sour
for
me
once
the
sweetness
wears
off
2
84
american
dollars
for

fl
oz

very
good
sour
beer
for
those
who
would
like
to
try
a
sour
but
are
not
ready
for
the
super
sour
beers
like
a
berliner
weiss
style
i
was
excited
to
crack
into
this
one
as
it
came
in
a
small
8
4
oz
bottle
i
was
expecting
great
things
from
small
packages
the
label
claims
the
beer
has
been
aged
2
years
interesting
enough
anyway
it
poured
with
a
pure
brown
look
nothing
more
or
less
it
smells
of
an
old
fruit
covered
cask
yum
i
immediately
sensed
some
candylike
aspects
on
contact
sparkling
sweet
overtones
layers
nicely
on
a
dull
subtle
cherry
wood
essence
this
is
a
well
planned
top
notch
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
sipper
and
wonderfull
treat
after
dinner
before
dinner
or
durring
dinner
it
is
also
a
wonderful
introduction
to
belgian
beers
and
i
cant
wait
to
travel
the
long
belgian
road
the
only
beer
that
i
have
ever
tried
to
compare
to
this
beer
is
the
goudenband
and
i
really
didnt
like
it
very
sour
however
the
petrus
oud
bruin
definitely
found
acceptance
with
my
palate
and
found
a
spot
as
one
of
my
favorite
most
unique
beers
i
have
tasted
in
awhile
served
in
a
nice
sized
goblet
this
beer
gives
of
a
slightly
tinted
amber
brown
with
an
off
white
rising
head
the
aroma
is
that
of
fruit
and
malt
sweetness
and
i
found
no
sourness
at
all
to
the
smell
the
first
sip
was
very
sweet
and
the
fruit
and
candi
sugar
sweetness
complements
with
a
tart
apple
sharpness
that
is
very
enjoyable
a
well
done
belgium
brew
that
i
find
may
be
on
of
the
best
especially
within
its
style
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
pretty
good
drinkability
leaves
a
nice
dryness
the
drinkability
would
be
a
lot
higher
but
the
sourness
may
be
hard
to
handle
after
a
few
of
these
stats

that
said
this
is
still
a
fine
old
brown
ale
very
accomplished
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
that
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lace
aroma
is
sour
with
some
apple
and
spice
flavor
begins
with
some
vinegar
sourness
and
some
dried
prune
caramel
and
apple
notes
also
has
a
peppery
spiciness
to
the
finish
has
a
thin
and
spritzy
body
almost
like
a
sparkling
wine
a
nice
rendition
of
a
flanders
ale
but
not
something
im
likely
to
seek
out
this
ale
pours
a
striking
walnut
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
is
full
of
carbonation
and
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
leaving
a
nice
lace
pattern
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
sour
sweet
malt
vapors
meld
with
strong
acidic
sour
beer
notes
like
that
of
a
belgian
red
ale
the
taste
starts
with
a
rich
maltiness
that
is
quickly
over
powered
by
the
oak
sourness
the
finish
moves
away
from
the
sourness
and
has
a
blend
of
dry
fruits
with
spice
as
its
major
taste
components
the
aftertaste
is
very
dry
with
hints
of
sourness
blending
with
malt
sweetness
no
hop
presence
here
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
silky
with
a
slight
effervescence
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
nice
example
of
a
belgian
oud
bruin
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
taste
and
aftertaste
and
this
would
be
a
great
oud
bruin
pours
a
dark
reddish
colour
topped
by
a
fairly
nice
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
quite
weird
it
reminds
me
of
half
a
dozen
familiar
smells
but
none
of
which
i
can
name
the
flavor
was
refreshing
and
a
bit
fruity
burgundy
to
brown
color
thin
light
fizzy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
and
sour
combination
of
lambic
like
very
sour
apples
smells
some
subtle
oak
undertones
it
went
downhill
from
there
taste
was
a
highly
carbonated
overly
charged
sour
apples
soda
pop
like
feel
supercharged
just
couldnt
get
anything
going
nearly
lambic
like
in
the
sour
carbonated
finish
the
label
claims
it
is
stored
in
oak
casks
for
2
years
this
tastes
like
it
was
stored
in
an
oak
shoe
and
dirty
sock
for
2
years
to
higly
carbonated
thin
and
flat
out
wierd
tastes
going
on
here
very
tough
to
finish
doesnt
improve
at
is
warms
i
hope
i
got
a
bad
batch
not
good
medium
dark
reddish
brown
with
fair
number
of
suspended
yeast
particles
light
tan
head
is
not
sluggish
but
not
excitable
either
the
arom
is
rose
floral
brown
sugar
wood
and
for
some
reason
that
i
have
no
clue
of
ketchup
the
flavor
is
clear
and
reserved
with
a
slight
fruitiness
apple
with
a
mildly
sour
finish
dark
reddish
brown
body
fairly
clear
but
you
dont
see
much
through
a
color
as
dark
as
this
pours
to
a
nice
head
but
it
fades
very
quickly
some
faint
traces
of
co2
present
in
body
this
beer
smells
heavenly
and
my
mouth
watered
as
soon
as
i
inhaled
the
aroma
sour
fruity
aroma
dominates
the
smell
but
theres
plenty
of
sweet
malt
to
back
it
up
slight
grassy
notes
are
also
noticeable
taste
just
doesnt
really
deliver
its
certainly
not
bad
but
its
not
what
it
could
and
should
be
slightly
sour
tasting
brew
with
notes
of
raisins
and
cherries
a
bit
malty
with
a
bit
of
oily
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
solid
nice
and
smooth
overall
its
a
good
brew
but
ill
stick
with
goudenband
when
i
want
an
old
brown
a
beautiful
pour
nice
light
brown
color
with
a
reddish
tint
smell
is
amazing
musky
and
fruity
with
a
sour
note
that
is
well
balanced
with
the
prune
and
raisin
malt
aroma
sourness
in
the
flavor
is
very
nice
and
complex
malt
is
in
back
but
provides
a
nice
sweet
balance
to
the
sourness
surprisingly
the
oak
character
doesnt
come
through
a
lot
not
nearly
as
much
as
rodenbach
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
sour
brown
the
sourtart
character
of
this
beer
might
not
appeal
to
everyone
but
i
found
it
a
great
change
of
pace
for
a
late
evening
sipper
the
8
5
oz
bottle
is
kind
of
small
but
for
this
beer
it
is
appropriate
as
it
is
not
something
you
would
want
to
drink
in
bulk
this
is
a
beer
to
sip
and
savor
this
is
not
like
any
brown
from
the
states
good
carbonation
and
head
deep
ruby
red
color
its
aged
2
years
in
oak
casks
and
this
must
give
it
the
sweetsour
viney
taste
tiny
bottle
8
4oz
for
2
69
overall
this
beer
strikes
me
a
a
bit
unbalanced
on
the
sour
side
the
contrast
between
sweet
malt
and
sour
esters
can
be
pleasant
but
here
detracted
from
the
overall
drinking
experience
gorgeous
transparent
mahogany
the
head
dissipates
quickly
lovely
nose
of
pit
fruits
especially
plums
with
a
mouthwatering
sour
note
thick
and
a
bit
sweet
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
a
burnt
sugar
taste
nowhere
near
as
acidic
or
tangy
as
the
nose
indicated
and
a
bit
short
this
bottleconditioned
beer
is
probably
a
bit
past
its
prime
but
nowhere
near
the
five
and
half
years
past
its
prime
that
its
best
before
date
of
february
19
1997
would
indicate
this
beer
has
been
in
my
wine
cellar
since
purchase
some
5
years
ago
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
red
hue
tangyfruity
aromas
in
the
nose
very
little
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
was
heard
to
resurrect
lighter
bodied
than
other
beers
in
the
style
sweet
and
sour
flavor
leaning
more
towards
the
sweet
overall
a
good
beer
in
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
this
is
a
good
beer
but
the
cough
medicine
flavor
kinda
lingers
wish
it
had
a
little
more
sour
great
sour
beer
amazing
cherry
flavors
extremely
easy
to
drink
cant
wait
to
enjoy
this
beer
again
interesting
beer
taste
more
like
a
lambic
than
an
oud
bruin
to
me
flavours
include
more
cherry
marzipan
and
a
very
slight
acidity
pretty
cloyingly
sweet
o
well
priced
sour
easy
drinking
for
a
palate
used
to
intense
sours
nice
if
you
love
cherries
you
will
love
this
beer
if
you
are
a
normal
person
and
think
cherries
are
decently
tasty
you
will
like
this
beer
but
perhaps
get
tired
of
it
quick
it
tastes
like
cherries
but
not
much
else
a
tasty
beer
just
not
super
complex
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
want
much
more
than
one
glass
of
o
not
as
impressed
as
with
the
aged
pale
ale
this
is
still
a
good
beer
with
lots
of
cherry
would
like
to
get
some
more
sour
tart
flavors
and
maybe
some
oak
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
cherry
bomb
this
is
your
beer
at
8
5
abv
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
im
partial
to
flanders
red
i
love
this
here
beer
way
too
much
cherry
not
nearly
enough
sour
tastes
like
cherry
cough
syrup
a
little
too
much
cherry
for
me
if
you
like
the
taste
of
cherries
you
should
enjoy
this
ale
not
too
sour
overly
sweet
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
mouth
feel
is
good
thick
and
leaves
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
was
expecting
a
sour
but
still
pretty
impressed
o
i
would
not
purchase
a
bottle
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
very
strong
sour
flavor
will
give
you
a
taste
bud
orgasm
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
its
worth
it
for
a
occasional
celebration
beautiful
deep
red
pour
very
cherry
amazing
beer
do
want
cherries
at
the
forefront
a
cross
between
a
kriek
and
a
sour
pours
out
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
minimal
tightly
beaded
head
aroma
of
cough
medicine
taste
a
bit
smoother
with
some
elements
of
chocolate
cherry
tootsie
pop
as
mentioned
by
an
earlier
rater
pure
sour
finish
nice
cherry
flavor
and
aroma
which
is
not
overpowering
mostly
sweet
character
with
a
mild
tartness
robitussinlike
flavor
in
the
finish
is
slightly
off
set
harsh
carbonation
when
first
opened
i
recorked
the
bottle
and
drank
the
rest
the
next
day
and
the
carbonation
was
perfect
taste
raspberry
cranberry
mix
perfectly
with
the
mildly
syrupy
texture
and
sweetness
cherry
in
the
middle
which
opens
to
nice
carbonation
and
a
faint
lingering
mouthfeel
very
nice
sour
with
light
cherry
on
the
back
draft
in
glass
goblet
the
cherries
were
a
bit
over
powering
for
me
great
tasting
sour
a
dark
chocolate
praline
filled
with
cherry
liquor
bing
cherries
and
caramel
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
perhaps
from
alcohol
lightly
sweet
medium
acidity
for
a
sour
candy
like
yet
not
too
artificial
not
as
authentic
as
rodenbach
but
has
some
soul
to
it
and
succeeds
as
a
balanced
fruity
treat
pour
from
a
330
into
a
tulip
i
have
nothing
to
add
to
other
reviews
regarding
appearance
of
color
head
retention
i
will
say
that
the
cherry
sour
and
any
malty
sweetness
are
more
subtle
compared
to
other
red
flemmish
the
sweet
seems
to
have
more
of
a
fruit
genesis
than
malt
i
prefer
a
sharper
more
sour
beer
from
this
category
overall
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
but
still
very
solid
i
think
i
changed
my
mind
on
this
beer
with
every
waft
and
sip
certainly
only
an
every
once
in
a
while
beer
but
something
that
keeps
the
palate
on
its
toes
the
chaliced
beer
arrived
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
exuding
fumes
of
soured
fruits
difficult
to
identify
any
particulars
strong
sour
notes
on
the
palate
however
it
was
void
of
complexity
and
balance
drinkable
ok
i
suppose
but
could
use
a
little
tlc
interesting
but
not
really
complex
enough
as
a
belgian
red
o
very
enjoyable
cherry
ale
would
definitely
drink
again
o
very
refreshing
brew
that
hides
the
alcohol
brilliantly
big
cherry
notes
take
center
stage
dont
drink
it
without
some
assertive
tastes
to
oppose
it
o
certainly
not
the
best
example
of
this
style
it
should
be
known
that
it
is
full
of
cherry
in
the
smell
and
taste
goudenband
la
folie
and
monks
cafés
versions
for
example
are
neither
cherry
nor
sweet
forward
as
this
is
still
its
nice
to
try
the
style
and
it
makes
me
realize
the
boundaries
of
the
style
extends
further
than
id
realized
bought
at
bruisin
ales
in
asheville
looks
nice
poured
a
clear
but
deep
ruby
red
with
big
dense
pinktinged
head
lots
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
tons
of
cherry
mildly
tart
brown
sugar
sweetness
taste
cherry
peaches
in
brown
sugar
mild
herbal
and
oak
notes
seems
like
a
kriek
to
me
not
much
else
going
on
my
wife
really
likes
this
beer
and
would
have
rated
it
a
4
5
she
liked
it
so
much
that
we
want
the
the
liquor
store
and
bought
both
the
beer
and
the
glass
ware
that
went
with
this
beer
dark
malt
start
without
any
toasted
or
chocolate
note
and
an
overpowering
fruit
punch
flavora
bit
artificial
leans
to
the
rich
side
with
light
carbonation
in
a
word
sweet
probably
good
with
cheese
i
find
it
hard
to
fault
this
beer
but
if
one
might
id
imagine
that
theys
say
it
needs
more
complexity
or
more
real
fruitiness
i
however
would
beg
to
differ
its
rich
and
just
complex
enough
i
find
it
malty
fruity
and
wellrounded
with
spiky
accents
of
character
just
as
an
oud
bruin
should
be
o
based
on
the
overpowering
aroma
and
flavor
from
the
cherries
i
did
not
expect
to
enjoy
this
as
much
as
i
did
the
parts
come
together
very
well
worth
trying
for
sure
i
got
no
idea
why
this
isnt
more
revered
very
sweet
beer
almost
like
a
hard
cherry
root
beer
it
has
a
nice
deep
ruby
red
color
a
nice
carbonation
that
creates
small
bubbles
and
leaves
some
foam
it
will
do
as
a
great
dessert
beer
due
to
the
sweetness
i
was
not
able
to
finish
the
bottle
myself
if
i
had
thought
of
it
as
a
soda
i
may
have
finished
it
but
under
the
stigma
of
a
sweet
beer
i
had
a
hard
time
emptying
the
bottle
while
the
nose
hinted
at
an
overly
sweet
fruitforward
beer
the
flavor
proved
to
be
quite
interesting
a
good
cherry
flemish
ale
thats
enjoyable
if
not
earthshattering
this
is
a
great
beer
i
can
see
why
its
so
expensive
because
it
requires
a
ton
of
fruit
to
make
goes
down
way
to
easy
liquid
candy
i
could
easily
throw
3
of
these
back
no
problem
highly
recommended
overall
a
surprisingly
different
take
on
a
flanders
oud
bruin
not
my
favorite
but
i
enjoyed
trying
it
o
a
very
nice
brew
i
love
sours
and
this
one
is
on
the
top
of
the
list
for
me
so
far
taste
starts
with
cherries
and
moves
slightly
floral
then
finishes
with
a
complex
cherry
vanilla
note
an
excellent
sour
would
make
a
good
transitional
brew
for
people
that
dont
love
sours
yet
overall
favorite
of
the
petrus
bunch
would
like
a
bit
more
tart
but
more
substantive
than
some
of
the
sodalike
sours
ive
had
will
order
whenever
i
see
it
o
this
beer
was
okay
but
the
fruit
quality
is
too
sweet
and
too
artificial
for
me
to
want
it
again

offering
a

here
not

and
the

clash
fruit
overkill
drinkable
but
hard
to
return
to
overall
not
great
the
aroma
and
taste
are
just
unbearable
the
medicinal
taste
and
aroma
really
ruin
the
beautiful
looking
beer
maybe
it
was
the
way
my
bartender
poured
the
beer
but
it
was
presented
to
me
with
no
head
no
lacing
the
color
was
a
hazy
amber
brown
with
ruby
red
shining
through
in
the
light
the
nose
did
not
have
much
to
it
a
faint
vinous
quality
and
the
smell
of
cherry
koolaid
but
i
could
smell
the
alcohol
so
it
was
all
too
reminiscent
of
a
four
loko
it
tasted
like
a
red
wine
with
koolaid
overtones
along
with
a
faint
wood
characteristic
the
finish
brought
a
moderate
sour
yeast
taste
mouthfeel
was
watery
with
medium
carbonation
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
very
much
and
i
definitely
wont
seek
it
out
again
overall
a
beer
im
not
likely
to
order
again
and
while
one
might
be
tempted
to
recommend
it
as
an
entrylevel
sour
beer
i
dont
think
you
get
enough
tartness
to
really
acclimate
a
new
drinker
to
the
sour
flavor
profiles
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
for
someone
who
was
trying
to
transition
from
mixed
drinks
to
beer
but
i
think
there
are
much
better
takes
on
the
flanders
oud
bruin
style
its
times
like
this
that
i
love
being
able
to
try
a
beer
on
tap
instead
of
shelling
out
the
full
bottle
price
m
it
coats
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
slippery
sweet
residue
not
pleasant
at
all
this
creature
is
onedimensional
and
very
short
on
the
qualities
that
balance
out
a
beer
o
i
was
wildly
surprised
by
this
beer
pleased
with
the
complexity
of
the
layering
in
flavors
and
will
definitely
enjoy
this
again
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
drink
these
all
night
anyways
if
you
like
sweet
not
sour
fruit
beers
this
is
the
one
for
you
in
the
face
of
the
potential
for
making
a
cough
syrup
beer
the
brewers
in
this
case
have
pulled
off
a
successful
blending
of
a
fruit
beer
and
an
oud
bruin
the
cherry
flavor
could
probably
stand
to
be
a
little
more
restrained
but
im
not
complaining
o
i
like
it
even
if
its
not
a
flanders
red
andor
oude
outright
really
reminds
me
of
what
adult
cherry
coke
would
be
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
first
venture
into
new
styles
but
a
nice
segue
into
these
styles
from
an
intermediate
saison
drinker
best
served
cold
it
actually
gets
worse
as
it
warms
its
the
dark
maltiness
and
earthen
qualities
that
makes
the
beer
an
similar
to
oude
bruin
but
its
sour
cherry
character
speaks
flanders
red
ale
the
culmination
causes
it
to
become
either
a
well
balanced
red
or
a
more
sour
brown
o
man
this
was
great
sweet
tart
not
too
pricey
i
really
liked
it
try
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
get
a
lindemens
goudenband
spelling
instead
of
this
mediciney
beer
overall
interesting
cherry
is
good
but
way
too
sweet
not
a
bad
brew
per
se
but
really
not
what
most
people
will
be
looking
for
you
probably
expect
a
highly
oaky
dry
and
tart
beer
with
sour
cherries
and
tons
of
vinous
grape
not
exactly
the
case
here
this
is
more
of
a
sweet
cherry
fruit
beer
in
that
regard
it
can
be
enjoyed
more
thoroughly
looking
at
it
that
way
i
much
prefer
this
to
say
founders
cerise
as
far
as
oud
bruins
go
though
its
not
as
hot
still
a
decent
thing
to
try
for
the
cherry
lovers
out
there
overall
a
good
flemish
red
cant
complain
here
the
body
is
very
much
on
the
light
edge
of
medium
but
reaching
carbonation
is
light
and
crispness
adds
bite
it
does
go
a
touch
flat
though
at
which
point
it
relies
too
heavily
on
carbonation
deep
red
hint
of
pink
maintains
a
ring
of
foam
a
smidge
of
lacing
along
the
top
smell
reminds
me
of
my
moms
cherry
pie
not
really
mediciny
as
id
read
only
reason
i
took
the
time
to
write
a
review
taste
is
tart
sweet
cherries
not
much
else
a
minor
booziness
highlights
the
cough
syrup
qualities
would
be
nice
to
taste
some
malt
in
there
interesting
glad
i
tried
it
but
prob
wont
check
it
out
any
more
overall
its
a
great
looking
beer
but
other
than
that
i
wasnt
much
of
a
fan
the
cherry
flavors
are
pleasant
but
theres
also
some
medicinal
notes
that
accompany
it
and
make
it
feel
a
little
bit
like
drinking
a
cherry
cough
drop
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
the
price
i
would
have
gotten
something
more
true
to
style
or
in
other
words
i
would
not
have
bought
this
if
i
knew
it
was
sweetened
doesnt
say
it
on
the
bottle
but
its
obvious
while
drinking
this
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
very
thin
head
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
cherries
and
hints
of
oak
the
taste
is
rather
interest
as
its
not
quite
a
sour
ale
and
not
quite
a
lambic
either
taste
fairly
good
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
still
kind
of
a
desert
beer
though
not
bad
i
would
recommend
trying
it
oi
have
a
hard
time
calling
this
brew
an
oud
bruin
because
it
drinks
more
like
a
highpowered
kriek
the
flavors
are
quite
sweet
and
cherryforward
and
once
you
get
over
the
massive
sweetness
there
is
a
little
bit
of
enjoyment
to
be
had
this
beer
might
work
for
dessert
but
unless
you
want
sweetness
be
wary
side
note
i
feel
like
this
brew
is
very
comparable
to
delirium
red
o
this
beer
focus
on
fruit
sweettart
and
light
spice
if
you
dont
like
sweet
beer
you
might
want
to
avoid
this
one
i
think
it
has
a
decent
sweettart
balance
but
the
sugar
is
winning
here
o
very
good
ale
that
really
highlights
the
cherry
i
didnt
even
realize
until
now
that
there
are
cherries
on
the
label
im
a
little
dense
sometimes
if
you
lean
towards
fruit
beers
or
sours
you
should
give
this
a
try
overall
i
give
it
3
5
for
the
cherrific
fun
of
drinking
it
and
the
ample
buzz
provided
by
the
alcohol
content
but
if
you
dont
really
really
like
cherries
dont
buy
this
youll
be
disappointed
pours
a
deep
plum
color
with
faint
ruby
highlights
and
a
handsome
cap
of
pinktinged
foam
the
aroma
consists
most
prominently
of
sour
cherry
the
flavor
has
a
puckering
sourness
up
front
accompanied
by
a
strong
cherry
flavor
reminiscent
of
cough
syrup
there
is
also
a
slight
oaken
flavor
that
appears
to
struggle
some
against
the
cherry
backbone
im
a
fan
of
petrus
and
of
sour
ales
in
general
but
not
so
much
of
cherry
in
this
case
the
cherry
flavor
is
so
predominant
that
it
overrides
my
affinity
for
the
style
cherry
lovers
will
doubtless
enjoy
this
brew
but
its
a
bit
too
onedimensional
for
my
tastes
o
not
even
close
to
the
beer
that
petrus
aged
pale
is
though
i
admire
the
ingenuity
i
expected
a
sour
beer
i
didnt
get
it
and
now
im
left
with
cherry
syrup
in
a
glassdespite
all
that
i
did
enjoy
this
drink
strange
beer
for
sure
pours
a
clear
dark
red
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
cherry
forward
with
cherry
cola
cherry
syrup
and
dark
cherry
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
malt
and
medicinal
cherry
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
cherry
smell
but
the
flavors
are
just
a
bit
too
much
like
cough
medicine
in
my
opinion
taste
starts
out
initially
quite
sweet
and
is
met
with
a
good
tart
cherry
note
with
some
dryness
as
if
it
has
been
aged
which
it
is
i
wont
say
that
it
is
extremely
complex
or
even
that
interesting
but
its
pretty
drinkable
seems
to
draw
a
line
between
a
sweet
fruit
beer
and
the
beginnings
of
a
flanders
red
sour
more
on
the
sweet
probably
on
draught
at
the
yard
house
in
west
nyack
ny
has
a
great
deep
red
color
with
no
real
head
from
the
glass
smells
like
cherry
syrup
no
real
tart
at
all
very
sweet
with
a
sticky
feel
left
on
the
roof
of
my
mouth
would
pair
well
with
the
right
foods
buttoo
sweet
for
a
pint
d
hey
youre
not
a
fruit
beer
are
you
i
like
you
the
aroma
had
me
nervous
but
this
turned
out
well
enough
in
the
end
im
glad
i
opted
for
the
small
bottle
though
o
its
not
bad
but
i
had
really
hoped
for
more
the
sour
and
tart
character
i
expected
was
mostly
lacking
im
wondering
now
if
this
should
have
been
cellared
for
a
period
of
time
but
i
dont
expect
that
ill
be
trying
it
out
overall
a
very
mainstream
middle
of
the
road
offering
in
the
petrus
line
here
its
ok
fruit
beer
nothing
special
or
something
id
look
for
again
pours
a
deep
ruby
red
like
color
with
a
skim
white
head
and
leaves
very
little
lace
the
aroma
is
of
cherries
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
sweet
cherry
flavor
and
then
gives
way
to
a
tart
okay
cherry
flavor
the
mouth
feel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
sticky
overall
its
a
very
good
tasting
beer
but
not
very
complex
its
an
easy
drink
and
one
i
will
have
again
this
beer
was
recommended
to
me
by
where
i
buy
my
beer
sometimes
after
he
saw
i
bought
a
4
pack
of
petruss
goulden
tripel
i
shall
return
there
to
thank
him
overall
really
leaves
an
impression
so
points
for
that
but
also
somewhat
dissapointing
not
what
i
expected
from
petrus
an
11oz
bottle
seemed
like
too
much
would
drink
it
again
in
a
smaller
portion
possibly
with
a
dessertcheeses
or
by
itself
after
dinner
could
also
be
interesting
mixed
with
a
wheat
beer
or
stout
o
this
almost
seems
more
like
a
flanders
red
than
an
oud
bruin
but
it
is
enjoyable
appearance
is
deep
red
with
nice
clarity
and
splotchy
head
nose
is
full
of
candied
cherry
with
mild
tart
notes
throughout
the
fruit
definitely
tames
the
sour
of
the
base
and
adds
a
great
deal
of
sweetness
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
still
sweet
at
the
end
with
a
slight
tartness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
the
fruit
is
too
artificial
and
sweet
for
my
liking
it
makes
an
otherwise
delicious
beer
run
of
the
mill
petrus
aged
red
is
a
really
strange
beer
to
add
to
the
petrus
line
up
its
a
good
beer
for
sure
not
great
but
certainly
tasty
the
problem
is
that
it
is
not
sour
at
all
petrus
aged
red
is
a
sweet
cherry
forward
beer
theres
almost
no
hint
of
tartness
at
all
in
there
i
enjoyed
it
but
couldnt
help
but
think
about
how
much
better
it
would
be
if
it
were
just
a
little
tart
as
i
drank
it
a
decent
kriek
an
okay
oud
bruin
i
wanted
to
judge
the
cherry
character
but
its
somewhat
legit
a
little
too
sweet
but
the
maltiness
is
nice
i
mixed
a
little
bit
in
a
separate
glass
with
some
voodoo
cowbell
and
it
was
quite
dandy
this
was
a
really
nice
beer
the
cherries
were
intense
and
tart
and
added
a
great
compliment
to
this
sour
ale
i
was
really
impressed
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
great
beer
for
tasting
and
sharing
but
im
not
sure
id
purchase
for
a
casual
laid
back
beer
overall
a
really
sweet
creamy
body
with
delicious
tart
cherry
notes
at
the
back
o
a
disappointment
compared
to
petrus
aged
pale
but
still
a
drinkable
beer
i
was
hoping
that
is
was
going
to
be
sour
and
great
but
it
isnt
even
that
dart
i
probable
wont
get
this
again
since
petrus
aged
pale
is
a
little
cheaper
overall
nice
beer
and
very
good
example
of
the
style
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
beer
and
had
big
expectations
a
nice
blend
of
vaguely
tart
with
oak
and
earth
and
a
boat
load
of
cherry
skin
and
flesh
solid
with
some
bonus
points
for
not
being
a
cloyingly
sweet
cherry
mess
o
its
8
5
and
drinks
like
semimalty
cherry
soda
with
less
sugar
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
a
dangerously
quaffable
cherry
beer
overall
consider
me
a
fanboy
but
i
cant
bash
any
beer
with
such
great
cherry
flavor
it
doesnt
taste
artificial
to
boot
so
i
am
not
sure
why
the
hate
one
of
the
best
fruit
based
beers
i
had
in
a
while
if
it
wasnt
for
the
10
dollar
price
tag
i
would
have
a
bottle
in
my
fridge
every
week
o
an
ok
flanders
red
but
at
this
price
point
id
much
rather
go
with
rodenbach
red
the
aged
pale
is
much
better
and
traditional
drain
poured
o
a
tasty
beer
overall
not
as
good
as
petrus
aged
pale
and
lacking
some
complexity
but
if
you
want
a
nice
simple
tart
and
fruity
beer
this
is
a
good
option
and
reasonably
priced
o
a
beautiful
glass
of
beer
sweeter
than
expected
could
show
more
sour
to
balance
the
sweetness
for
my
tastes
