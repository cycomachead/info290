starts
out
with
a
couple
centimeters
of
light
khaki
bubbles
on
top
of
deep
brown
beer
that
doesnt
let
much
light
through
but
does
turn
just
a
bit
red
at
the
edges
the
smell
is
mostly
sweet
with
a
lot
of
dark
fruit
plums
and
the
like
very
little
in
the
way
of
malt
or
typical
stout
like
bitter
chocolate
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
smooth
dark
malts
with
only
a
hint
of
the
bitterness
that
you
would
expect
the
fruitiness
comes
through
as
well
but
the
taste
is
much
more
dynamic
than
the
smell
with
a
lot
of
the
more
belgian
flavors
of
earthy
yeasty
vinous
flavors
in
there
as
well
overall
strange
for
a
stout
and
more
like
a
belgian
dark
rather
full
bodied
but
quite
smooth
with
low
levels
of
carbonation
and
a
finish
that
is
only
slightly
dry
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
an
unusual
take
on
the
style
that
has
enough
in
the
way
of
interesting
characteristics
to
make
it
worth
trying
but
doesnt
make
it
a
great
beer
overall
not
bad
but
a
little
dull
vaguely
reminiscent
of
a
st
fuellien
yeast
character
overall
not
bad
a
nice
export
style
stout
with
the
dark
malts
roasty
black
malts
hints
of
cocoa
and
caramel
a
little
burnt
notes
candi
sweetness
that
still
stays
really
dry
maybe
a
bit
too
much
on
the
burnt
like
notes
but
not
too
bad
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
too
surprising
for
what
its
gone
through
the
body
was
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
and
the
brew
wasnt
sticky
the
beer
had
a
finish
that
was
mostly
dry
but
did
have
a
a
touch
of
sweetness
drinkability
was
very
good
the
beer
went
down
quickly
and
easily
and
i
could
have
a
couple
in
a
sitting
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
a
very
tasty
beer
im
sad
that
i
only
have
one
measly
euro
bottle
of
it
this
is
something
to
splurge
on
once
in
a
while
drinkability
is
decent
loads
of
flavor
but
sharp
elbows
here
o
overall
glad
to
try
it
at
the
festival
as
it
is
something
i
see
on
the
shelf
quite
often
o
smooth
and
understated
a
nice
change
this
dark
mahogany
beer
has
a
durable
tan
head
and
leaves
very
good
lacing
the
near
creamy
texture
overlays
an
unusual
palate
that
seems
both
full
and
light
and
has
a
pleasant
semidry
finish
although
it
is
slightly
light
in
color
for
a
stout
and
has
an
unusual
yeasty
boozy
and
hoppy
aroma
in
tasting
this
is
indeed
a
belgian
stout
it
has
the
flavor
of
a
rather
spicy
and
hoppy
export
stout
with
the
added
complexity
imparted
by
belgian
yeast
and
inbottle
refermentation
the
dark
roasted
malts
do
come
to
the
fore
for
a
moment
now
and
again
in
the
finish
then
linger
in
the
durable
aftertaste
o
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
and
this
is
no
exception
not
painful
to
consume
although
ill
look
the
other
way
next
time
i
spot
one
o
very
drinkable
nicely
done
poured
into
a
maudite
snifter
pours
a
dark
ruddy
brown
appearing
nearly
black
in
the
glass
healthy
three
finger
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
massive
lacing
looks
nice
aroma
of
dark
fruit
with
a
lot
of
plum
toasted
malt
chocolate
and
a
slight
mineral
element
flavor
of
dark
and
dried
fruit
chocolate
coffee
and
slight
hops
on
the
finish
a
belgian
influence
to
the
yeast
and
fruit
complex
with
interesting
flavor
progression
nice
medium
body
with
excellent
creaminess
and
active
carbonation
appropriately
somewhat
dry
and
slightly
sour
as
expected
from
an
export
stout
i
lean
towards
the
russian
and
american
style
of
stout
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
of
the
nicer
export
stouts
ive
had
the
was
decent
enough
i
guess
and
while
there
was
an
assortment
of
flavors
here
the
strength
of
the
spice
just
kind
of
overran
everything
else
at
times
giving
the
profiles
a
bit
of
a
flat
feel
this
wasnt
offensive
or
anything
but
i
doubt
that
ill
be
trying
it
again
either
o
i
like
belgian
stouts
i
like
this
beer
ill
confess
this
one
was
late
in
a
tasting
night
so
perhaps
ill
need
to
revisit
it
at
some
point
to
refine
the
review
overall
very
goodtasting
and
interesting
brew
very
much
worth
a
sampling
o
overall
im
quite
dissapointed
way
too
thin
for
may
taste
it
feels
like
it
lacks
large
quantities
of
malt
a
thin
and
uninteresting
black
beer
not
impressed
a
really
nice
and
smooth
stout
not
very
dry
and
not
very
hop
dominated
very
drinkable
for
its
size
the
warmth
from
the
alcohol
does
not
really
set
in
until
half
the
glass
is
gone
very
well
balanced
a
treat
to
drink

served
ontap

black
with

small

aroma
is
light
just
a
little
roast
and
belgian

the
flavor
is
light
small
roasted
malt
and
a
sour
twang
too
belgian
yeast
plays
a
role
adding
a
subtle
fruityness
that
works
well
with
the
mild
sour
note
more
roasted
malt
on
the
back
end
but
somewhat
thin
as
is
the
body
smooth
and
easy
drinking
an
interesting
brew
that
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
in
a
word
lackluster
overall
a
dark
charred

beer
that
is
like
a
belgian
quadruple
but
much
darker
and
ashen
can
make
a
good
nightcapper
aroma
has
a
strong
smoky
tone
with
coffee
and

components

roast
coffee

tones
with
a

is

not
as
thick
as

and
just
a
little
tingly
not
normally
a
fan
of
belgian

strains
in
stouts
this
is
somewhat
in
agreement
for
me
the
banana
just
doesnt
work
with
the

to

still

into

pitch
black
with
a
two
finger
beige
head
that
subsided
to
one

very
slowly
maintained

throughout
the

the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
cream
slight
roasted
malt
hints
of
caramel
and
slight
nuttiness
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
dark
chocolate
cream
and
a
slight
roastiness
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
brew
wasnt
that
bad
but
it
also
wasnt
that
great
neither
the
aroma
nor
flavor
were
very
robust
in
this
one
which
was
quite
disappointing
the
elements
that
were
there
were
quite
nice
but
it
just
lacked
in
intensity
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
once
is
enough
for
me
unless
they
can
work
on
the
robust
aspect
i

a
11
2

bottle
into
a

perfect

it

the

it
is
well
carbonated
imo
a
bsda
decent
maybe
too
sweet
d
desceptive
in
its
smoothness
nothing
says
that
it
is
at
7
6
abv
it
drinks
more
like
a
4
dry

its
not
bad
but
i
dont
know
if
id
buy
it
again
a

not

as
i
hopedexpected
drinkability
is
good
nice
brew
just
not
quite
all
i
was
hoping
for
d
in
spite
of
its
flaws
this
is
still
a
drinkable
beer
well
to
be
sure
i
had
two
bottles
o
this
i
completely
drank
both
with
some
otehr
beverages
including
lemon
water
inbetween
what
i
got
was
an
interesting
stout
black
with
a
white
foam
head
leaving
some
lace
on
the
aides
at
tehe
dnd
of
the
drinking
were
lots
of
lace
bits
the
first
bottle
more
than
the
second
i
detected
some
sourness
served
just
below
room
temperatre
each
time
at
beer
bistro
some
sweetness
yes
but
th
sourness
dominated
the
first
bottle
and
was
more
balanced
but
still
there
in
the
second
bottle
a
creaminess
in
th
mouthfeel
a
liuttle
chocolate
drying
not
a
swett
tout
as
advertsied
the
astringency
is
in
the
way
nothing
good
or
bad
just
not
worth
drinking
here
d
the
very
clean
light
flavor
wont
improve
much
with
age
and
there
was
very
little
character
to
begin
with
an
exceptional
beer
cant
wait
to
have
another
go
at
this
one
overall
more
stoutlike
than
belgian
like
very
little
carbonation
too
always
a
major
plus
in
my
book
d
for
the
style
very
drinkable
goes
down
extremely
easy
mmmmm
very
tasty
poured
with
a

yeasty
and
spicey
with
a

great
with
the

and
a
nice
play
between
bitter
dry

some

very
smooth

rounded

unexpected
taste
profile
but
a
distinctive
and
enjoyable
beer
for

bottle
into

very
surprising
for
a
stout
poured
like
most
stouts
with
a
strong
black
color
and
finger
and
a
half
foamy
light
brown
head
the
nose
was
reminiscent
of
many
other
belgians
with
the
sweetness
prevailing
the
malts
were
well
toasted
and
there
were
hints
of
both
molasses
and
chocolate
present
taking
a
taste
had
these
same
flavors
come
through
along
with
a
light
hint
of
coffee
that
provided
a
very
pleasant
aftertaste
a
great
find
glad
i
tried
this
from
tourney
a
good
shot
for
a
stout
but
misses
the
mark
a
bit
this
is
good
tasting
beer
that
perhaps
could
get
tweaked
in
the
future
the
7
5
shows
itself
minimally
in
feel
and
just
a
bit
in
taste
but
i
like
it
adds
to
whats
going
on
which
in
this
case
is
light
for
the
style
in
the
end
i
kind
of
got
this
bsda
kind
of
thing
mixed
with
a
light
stout

only
average
i
rated
the
taste
highly
for
its
multifaceted
character
but
the
grapefruit
flavor
is
a
little
offputting
rather
interesting
ive
little
experience
with
belgian
stouts
but
this
is
quite
subtle
and
seems
an
easy
segue
into
the
style
from
the
american
and
british
stouts
im
more
used
to
a
distinct
estery
belgian
spice
is
surprisingly
hidden
and
well
integrated
pretty
subtle
and
easy
overall
a
stronger
malt
profile
with
some
ampedup
roasty
notes
would
add
another
layer
of
complexity
from
which
this
beer
would
doubtlessly
benefit
im
certainly
glad
i
tried
it
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my

to
buy
another

id
drink
it
again

fruitiness
tastes
of
chcoolate
licorice
the
same
lighter
fruitiness
and
some
coffee
d
not
bad
nice
rare
gem
that
was
a
please
to
enjoy
taste
is
very
peaty
toasty
dry
but
not
sour
flat
mouthfeel
again
possibly
from
defective
capping
rather
than
intentional
strange
but
tasty
enough
overall
very
impressed
dont
know
if
the
port
characteristics
would
have
continued
to
develop
if
aged
another
two
years
but
it
hardly
matters
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
the
label
states
good
for
5
years
and
this
is
almost
6
but
very
enjoyable
o
not
a
bad
fes
age
has
mellowed
and
smooth
it
out
but
it
still
has
a
prominent
and
sharp
char
character
cant
imagine
how
strong
it
was
3
years
ago
alcohol
is
completely
hidden
drinks
like
a
67
porter
not
a
10
stout
nice
drinkability
as
a
result
good
beer
lacking
a
bit
in
complexity
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
best
i
have
had
from
the
demolen
brewery
a
great
looking
stout
great
roasted
scents
i
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
relative
lightness
to
the
body
the
rich
dark
malted
character
dominates
the
initial
taste
giving
away
to
a
nice
hop
bitterness
and
perhaps
grain
huskiness
or
tannin
note
and
a
faint
hint
at
the
relatively
high
abv
o
a
decent
export
stout
of
some
sort
but
not
something
id
really
go
after
again
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
but
i
also
didnt
think
it
was
good
enough
to
order
again
or
seek
out
a
bottle
of
o
i
would
like
to
try
another
bottle
to
see
if
the
taste
is
the
same
however
as
it
stands
it
is
a
pass
picked
this
up
at
the
brouwerij
de
molen
beer
store
dark
brown
almost
black
pour
that
turned
into
a
total
gusher
when
i
opened
it
had
this
happen
in
the
past
with
de
molen
beers
so
i
was
somewhat
prepared
and
saved
most
of
it
for
all
that
foam
and
head
it
didnt
last
long
at
all
and
had
minimal
lacing
huge
roasty
nose
with
a
ton
of
coffee
along
with
hints
of
cocoa
espresso
and
just
a
touch
of
hops
and
black
licorice
the
taste
follows
suit
with
loads
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
hints
of
tobacco
soy
sauce
and
a
bit
of
caramel
and
toffee
the
mouthfeel
leaned
more
towards
a
porter
than
a
stout
and
was
slightly
fizzy
the
finish
was
extra
dry
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
bite
the
alcohol
was
totally
hidden
making
this
extremely
drinkable
another
great
beer
from
de
molen
the
label
describes
this
beer
as
a
porter
but
it
definitely
isnt
it
is
somewhere
between
a
light
chocolatey
quad
a
belgian
stout
a
belgian
dark
strong
ale
whatever
this
is
it
was
interesting
this
is
a
laidback
beer
for
conversation
while
there
is
not
much
to
this
one
it
is
done
well
and
would
match
with
a
cigar
having
aged
18
months
in
the
bottle
it
has
clearly
mellowed
out
love
the
shit
out
of
this
brewerys
heaven
hell
one
of
the
bestever
stouts
but
sss
is
merely
okay
it
fails
biggest
in
the
smell
and
mouthfeel
categories
it
has
redeeming
elements
too
but
considering
how
transcendent
hh
was
ill
be
sipping
on
it
with
less
enthusiasm
than
expected
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
pretty
smooth
and
chewy
on
the
palate
not
bad
but
probably
not
worth
the
price
point
and
i
had
a
hard
time
picking
up
on
some
of
the
flavors
note
bottled
march
21
2011
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
the
beer
it
says
it
is
im
missing
something
or
anything
akin
to
an
english
porter
and
the
carbonation
really
detracts
from
something
that
might
better
fall
in
the
nebulous
belgian
strong
dark
ale
category
o
one
of
the
weirdest
stouts
ive
ever
tasted
but
also
one
of
the
most
memorable
if
david
lynch
were
to
go
into
the
brewing
business
and
create
a
stout
this
would
be
the
result
brown
pour
with
a
big
bubbly
white
head
the
lacing
is
fine
retention
is
great
the
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
and
roasted
malts
mostly
it
smells
a
lot
like
a
quad
honestly
really
not
a
lot
of
stout
characteristics
big
dark
fruits
booze
roasted
malts
on
the
backend
with
perhaps
some
coffee
this
tasted
like
a
nice
blend
of
a
quad
and
a
stout
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
medium
body
carbonated
well
hints
of
booze
i
liked
this
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
a
welcomed
mix
unlike
any
stout
ive
had
before
overall
pretty
neat
tasting
quite
unique
interesting
angle
rather
enjoy
it
even
though
it
has
some
odd
characters
overall
another
good
de
molen
brew
this
is
kind
of
a
touchstone
for
their
stout
beer
as
it
is
a
tasty
and
aromatic
beer
but
would
need
a
heavier
thicker
palate
to
really
get
the
flavors
over
the
hump
a
tighter
head
would
also
help
the
scores
that
said
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
if
youre
interested
in
the
brewery
this
would
be
a
stout
to
check
out
if
you
enjoy
it
then
their
barrel
aged
and
smaller
batch
stuff
would
be
well
worth
tracking
down
a
good
beer
that
ive
had
before
and
will
have
again
recommended
may
be
better
fresh
not
sure
i
would

this
beer
was
said
to
be
a
rarity
when
i
saw
it
on
the
menu
at
the
bethlehem
speakeasy
i
figured
that
i
must
try
it
then
since
im
easily
persuaded
into
things
like
this
the
bottle
was
split
between
a
friend
and
myself
that
night
the
pour
was
nice
it
gave
of
a
deep
black
color
with
a
creamy
brown
looking
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
little
while
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
very
heavy
burnt
aromas
coming
off
of
it
there
was
a
booze
aroma
too
that
was
also
there
the
taste
of
the
bee
was
very
dry
and
gave
off
plenty
of
burnt
toast
flavors
mixed
with
some
rich
dark
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
was
lighter
than
i
expected
a
triple
stout
to
be
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
pretty
good
id
say
if
you
have
the
money
on
hand
give
it
a
try
but
if
not
youre
really
not
missing
out
on
too
much
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
have
to
purchase
it
again
o
really
an
enjoyable
beer
minus
the
thinovercarbonated
mouthfeel
i
love
lots
of
coffee
in
a
beer
and
this
definitely
delivers
i
will
have
to
grab
another
bottle
the
next
time
i
see
some
nice
beer
poured
into
a
aarge
int
glass
a
deep
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
tinge
when
held
to
the
lighta
one
finger
beige
head
atop
heavy
roast
and
molasses
really
stood
out
in
the
nosesome
alcohol
sweetness
crept
thru
as
well
a
creamy
feel
that
coats
the
mouth
dark
fruit
and
dark
chocolate
dominate
the
palatea
great
mix
of
flavors
an
feel
to
this
beercomplex
and
flavorful
i
would
buy
again
in
a
heartbeat
overall
perfectly
balanced
traditional
triple
stout
happy
that
i
finally
tried
ah
yes
there
we
are
we
served
it
too
cold
now
im
gathering
much
more
complexity
the
aforementioned
chocolate
gives
a
nice
cocoa
sweetness
followed
by
a
burnt
toast
flavor
then
the
ash
oh
man
this
is
an
ashy
beer
and
the
alcohol
is
still
quite
prominent
its
a
bit
harsh
and
the
very
light
body
doesnt
really
help
imo
its
a
two
dimensional
beer
a
couple
of
flavors
alcohol
good
but
not
great
notes
nice
historic
exercise
maybe
not
too
exciting
but
what
pattinson
and
menno
do
here
is
rather
welcome
quality
offering
and
a
stimulating
insight
into
vintage
brewing

just
had
a
bottle
bottled
may
24th
2013
i
did
remove
some
of
the
more
trivial
observations
from
my
initial
review
as
well
as
keeping
in
some
of
the
more
extreme
and
perhaps
exaggerated
observations
basically
this
beer
exhibits
much
of
the
same
characteristics
as
their
other
dark
beers
which
is
great
as
i
love
them
however
despite
its
abv
and
ostensibly
fullersweeter
constitution
this
beer
doesnt
dazzle
and
it
could
very
well
be
attributed
to
poor
handling
andor
staling
oxidation
if
you
do
happen
to
find
a
bottle
serve
it
at
cellar
temp
and
go
from
there
drinkability
im
glad
this
is
a
750ml
bottle
because
i
think
i
would
be
highly
disappointed
if
i
could
only
have
one
glass
of
this
the
sweetness
is
well
done
its
not
overly
cloying
or
stomach
sickening
and
the
mouthfeel
is
smoother
than
anything
ive
had
in
a
while
im
stoked
that
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
and
im
looking
forward
to
sharing
a
bottle
with
friends
sometime
in
the
near
future
as
this
beer
is
smooth
enough
that
in
my
opinion
even
nonbeer
geeks
would
be
able
to
enjoy
it
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
foreignexport
stout
thanks
again
to
drfabulous
for
sharing
this
rarity
o
surprisingly
straightforward
for
a
de
molen
beer
though
not
necessarily
within
the
given
style
d
an
easy
drinking
fes
for
the
abv
and
some
good
flavors
but
price
and
slight
tang
would
deter
me
from
seeking
this
out
again
darn
good
d
rare
enough
style
that
should
be
made
more
because
its
really
good
well
worth
a
purchase
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
this
month
notes
lots
of
flavor
a
serious
stout
seems
like
it
might
be
a
little
over
the
hill
though
or
maybe
the
yeast
is
just
failing
theres
something
in
here
that
reminds
me
of
old
homebrew
tasty
though
i
suspect
its
a
bit
more
expensive
that
id
be
willing
to
pay
it
took
a
few
minutes
to
let
the
bottle
warm
up
but
as
it
opened
it
let
off
hints
of
molasses
soy
even
a
touch
of
fish
sauce
it
really
put
into
perspective
the
term
umami
that
so
aptly
describes
many
of
the
stouts
ive
been
tasting
especially
since
quitting
cigarettes
meaty
earthy
salty
deliciousness
dnot
the
most
fantastic
stout
lacks
balance
in
flavor
and
complexity
but
doesnt
do
anything
wrong
that
ashy
bitter
coffee
flavor
is
something
i
find
in
a
lot
of
foreign
made
stouts
such
as
mikeller
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
for
an
original
recipe
out
of
1914
london
they
were
not
drinking
too
badly
back
then
not
bad
poured
a
fairly
dark
brown
with
a
decent
amount
of
red
highlights
making
its
way
through
when
held
up
to
light
head
is
super
huge
and
frothy
the
craters
are
impressive
in
this
brown
frothy
masterpeice
smells
of
dark
fruit
and
smokey
taste
super
malty
and
musty
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
coffee
feel
is
kinda
thin
but
nice
750ml
bottle
into
my
orval
glass
the
beer
pours
light
brown
settles
a
little
dark
with
tons
of
carbonation
at
least
four
fingers
of
light
tan
head
very
good
retention
but
lacing
is
really
light
as
it
falls
hardly
any
sticks
to
the
glass
the
aroma
and
taste
are
on
the
lighter
side
and
as
i
first
sipped
i
was
dreading
that
this
was
another
boring
english
stout
its
similar
as
it
is
certainly
on
the
lighter
side
in
feel
however
after
a
couple
sips
the
taste
really
comes
out
and
is
superbly
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
nict
lightly
roasted
coffee
i
cannot
imagine
a
foreign
export
stout
tasting
any
better
than
this
given
the
maltydry
texture
this
beer
was
a
serious
pleasure
to
drink
where
power
and
complexity
could
have
helped
i
cannot
overlook
the
simplicity
and
elegance
of
this
beer
a
solid
choice
for
any
dark
beer
lover
it
is
exceptional
man
o
man
these
guys
can
make
the
beer
very
similar
to
the
hell
damnation
but
a
tad
thiner
and
has
the
carbonation
a
little
easier
to
like
aroma
is
rich
coffee
cocoa
roast
malt
flavors
like
aroma
extremely
well
balanced
finish
is
like
flavor
tapering
and
of
medium
to
long
session
beer
despite
the
strength
world
classic
d
decent
but
its
strong
and
not
as
balanced
as
it
should
be
which
makes
it
a
bit
hard
to
drink
lots

194
pours
an
opaque
darkness
with
an
excessive
stiff
light
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
to
spotty
patterns
of
lacing
the
chalky
necco
chocolate
smell
seems
really
stale
and
oxidized
cardboard
yuk
it
tastes
just
like
it
smells
malty
without
sweetness
the
mouth
feel
has
a
tangy
character
finishes
almost
dry
a
tough
swallow
pour
this
rare
beer
was
the
last
one
on
the
shelf
thank
you
beer
gods
the
head
starts
off
good
with
decent
retention
the
nose
is
very
complex
with
hints
of
soy
sauce
and
salty
taffy
the
taste
starts
with
caramelized
dates
and
brown
sugar
the
next
wave
fades
into
a
dry
spicy
english
hops
profile
the
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
full
body
i
rated
the
drinkability
high
for
good
reason
that
this
brew
is
9
9
and
has
no
heat
with
a
smooth
well
balanced
finish
this
stout
was
worth
the
17
happy
new
year
to
all
d
surprisingly
nice
stout
with
plenty
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
goodness
as
an
export
stout
this
one
is
decent
but
it
doesnt
really
hold
up
to
the
majority
of
impy
stouts
out
there
at
the
same
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
though
a
little
overcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
limited
to
one
750ml
bottle
though
that
is
still
certainly
a
lot
d
we
found
the
drinkability
to
be
quite
high
i
was
expecting
more
of
an
alcohol
presence
but
it
was
nonexistant
the
soft
and
creamy
chocolate
and
oatmeallactose
flavors
aromas
made
this
one
go
down
like
a
stout
with
half
the
abv
a
good
stout
d
an
interesting
look
back
at
a
historic
recipe
i
think
id
like
a
better
balance
before
id
want
to
spend
another
20
on
one
of
these
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
it
wasnt
my
favorite
demolen
being
an
expensive
oneoff
im
sure
its
one
and
done
even
if
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
enjoyed
the
historical
underpinning
but
wish
they
had
provided
more
backstory
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
deep
roasted
flavor
with
some
good
depth
to
it
this
makes
a
nice
session
beer
but
at
10abv
it
will
be
a
short
session
there
is
no
need
for
any
age
on
this
beer
it
is
ready
to
drink
now
drinkability
is
way
good
here
but
this
is
a
rare
bird
and
as
high
as
the
abv
is
i
think
one
should
watch
out
i
dont
know
all
that
much
about
stouts
much
less
about
any
original
recipes
i
do
know
that
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
and
i
consider
it
one
of
the
better
beers
from
de

chocolate
is
the
aftertaste
found
at
state
line
liquor
only
675
bottles
in
the
batch
almost
more
than
the
roast
character
both
the
fruitiness
and
the
chocolate
notes
play
a
substantial
role
here
a
bit
more
balanced
even
more
refined
than
the
londonstyle
porter
there
is
enough
sweet
malt
here
to
stand
up
to
the
ample
roast
character
but
i
think
i
like
the
porter
better
than
this
beer
this
is
still
quite
tasty
and
definitely
interesting
it
drinks
a
lot
easier
than
its
10
would
suggest
dark
brownburgundy
color
with
a
long
lasting
light
tan
foam
aroma
seems
a
little
incomplete
with
yeast
smells
and
a
touch
of
leather
flavor
is
different
but
quite
outstanding
not
roasty
or
chocolatelike
at
all
but
loaded
with
dark
fruit
flavors
caramel
toffee
peanut
brittle
and
then
on
top
of
all
that
the
finish
is
nearly
20
seconds
really
complex
flavor
profile
nearly
perfect
not
an
imperial
stout
but
its
not
claiming
to
be
one
its
too
bad
the
nose
isnt
so
great
because
this
beer
is
nearly
perfect
in
every
other
way
billed
as
the
original
1914
recipe
london
triple
stout
by
ron
pattinson
brewed
by
the
mill
certainly
drinks
like
an
export
stout
that
is
a
little
more
bland
and
rough
than
most
of
the
style
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
favourite
stouts
a
solid
offering
from
samuel
smiths
that
makes
a
visit
to
one
of
their
pubs
well
worth
it
i
believe
its
only
available
on
draft
its
the
beer
that
other
dry
stouts
wish
they
could
be
very
good
stout
quite
malty
and
roasted
but
with
a
smooth
feeling
pours
a
black
color
13
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
dry
hop
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
slight
oatmeal
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
fits
the
style
of
a
foreign
export
stout
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
overall
good
appearance
aroma
and
blend
smooth
and
silky
even
though
its
dry
couldnt
drink
it
all
night
but
two
pints
would
be
fine
this
is
a
classic
delicious
candy
sweet
stout
lots
of
roast
lots
of
sugar
good
thing
its
only
4
5
because
i
could
see
tearing
through
this
cheers
i
travelled
all
the
way
to
tadcaster
itself
to
drink
one
of
these
extra
stouts
from
a
hand
pumped
cask
at
the
actual
samuel
smiths
brewery
in
england
since
i
had
never
seen
this
style
sam
in
usa
it
was
a
treat
indeed
to
find
this
new
variety
in
such
a
special
format
i
normally
drink
the
bottled
oatmeal
stout
and
love
that
type
but
the
extra
stout
was
amazing
it
was
thick
creamy
rich
and
extra
dark
in
color
a
slightly
sweet
milk
style
stout
best
enjoyed
in
an
imperial
pint
sevred
not
too
cold
so
this
was
perfect
in
the
way
it
was
served
a
must
try
if
ever
in
the
heartland
of
england
overall
a
very
good
stout
perfect
as
a
one
off
pint
hands
down
the
best
stout
ive
eve
had
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
see
this
grab
it
and
if
youre
in
london
make
a
trip
to
145
fleet
st
you
wont
regret
it
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
english
stout
nothing
particularly
amazing
but
overall
a
great
beer
fantastic
had
this
brew
on
tap
at
ye
old
cheshire
cheese
pub
in
england
great
place
to
have
a
great
beer
the
pour
was
a
rich
dark
brown
with
a
very
attractive
tan
head
smelled
nutty
with
hints
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
i
was
hooked
at
first
taste
it
was
brilliant
one
of
the
best
brews
ive
ever
had
it
was
creamy
thick
and
perfect
for
a
brisk
november
night
in
england
on
nitro
tap
at
the
cock
in
westminster
city
london
lookked
pitch
black
with
an
offwhite
head
the
initial
flavor
is
a
bit
bland
but
this
beer
comes
back
with
a
big
black
roasted
grain
aftertaste
this
is
a
great
english
stout
not
a
foreignexport
and
reminds
me
of
beamish
but
a
bit
cleaner
not
great
for
drinkability
just
because
of
its
thickness
and
chocolate
taste
great
for
an
afternoon
pint
though
overall
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
liked
the
traditional
elements
of
the
style
and
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
would
definitely
recommend
just
had
my
pint
poured
at
ye
olde
cheshire
cheese
in
london
maybe
its
the
gloom
of
the
pub
but
the
beer
is
inky
blank
maybe
a
tinge
of
brown
when
held
next
to
a
light
a
thin
layer
of
foam
persisted
from
the
serving
until
well
im
two
fingers
from
the
bottom
and
laced
the
side
of
my
glass
along
the
way
the
nose
is
grainy
hints
of
vegetal
chocolate
coffee
and
some
red
fruit
no
real
evidence
of
dry
hopping
flavor
is
burned
malt
caramel
grain
matter
chocolate
finnisb
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
it
could
be
not
evincing
a
dangerous
alcohol
content
this
is
not
a
session
beer
i
would
neither
object
to
a
second
or
make
time
for
it
d
refreshing
and
delicious
what
more
could
someone
wand
from
a
stout
could
have
everyday
without
complaint
md
surprisingly
smooth
and
light
in
texture
while
the
flavour
is
retained
to
the
full
this
is
a
lightmedium
bodied
and
fullflavoured
stout
to
quaff
for
sure
alas
it
also
suffers
from
being
overchilled
though
slightly
better
than
the
sovereign
best
bitter
as
its
full
flavour
could
struggle
through
still
this
beer
tastes
much
better
and
more
complex
when
warming
up
this
beer
is
obsidian
black
in
color
with
a
light
brown
head
there
is
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
aroma
coffee
and
chocolate
both
show
up
in
the
flavor
with
a
serious
raosted
malt
bitterness
throughout
the
finish
a
nice
beer
to
sit
and
savor
for
a
couple
of
pints
absolutely
superb
and
tremendous
value
excellent
beer
highly
recommeded
i
had
this
in
a
very
old
pub
in
london
i
also
had
mine
at
the
old
cheshire
cheese
served
at
the
proper
cool
temperature
the
beer
is
very
opaque
in
color
it
has
a
thick
creamy
head
that
is
a
bit
tan
lingers
all
the
way
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
made
up
of
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
similar
flavoring
with
a
bit
of
roastiness
i
had
this
after
a
pint
of
the
samuel
smith
old
brewery
bitter
at
ye
olde
cheshire
cheese
in
london
a
remarkable
place
in
itself
extremely
well
preserved
dickens
drank
here
for
crying
out
loud
black
nearly
opaque
in
color
big
dark
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
aroma
more
of
the
same
flavors
finishing
with
the
emphasis
on
roasted
bitterness
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
with
the
atmosphere
truly
an
experience
to
be
savored
overall
a
pretty
standard
stout
pours
a
lovely
liquid
dark
chocolate
black
in
the
glass
light
brown
frothy
head
reaches
nearly
two
inches
with
no
problem
nose
is
soft
but
full
with
tones
of
chocolate
sweet
malt
and
dark
very
ripe
fruits
first
sip
yields
an
amazing
smoothness
to
the
palate
creamy
layers
of
coco
and
milk
chocolate
mixed
with
those
same
dark
fruit
notes
that
i
dont
normally
see
play
this
well
in
a
stout
this
bottle
had
been
in
my
cellar
for
over
a
year
the
bottle
is
dated
73113
im
sure
this
has
something
to
do
with
how
smooth
and
well
balanced
this
brew
is
just
simply
a
wonderful
stout
overall
smooth
stout
great
feel
good
but
not
quite
amazing
taste
great
beer
tweener
stout
kinda
a
bit
dry
stout
kinda
a
bit
sweet
stout
and
a
nod
to
american
stout
basically
a
little
of
everything
almost
like
an
imperial
stout
just
scaled
down
a
bit
bottle
says
7
5
and
45
ibu
the
work
of
a
skilled
brewer
well
done
whoa
i
am
shocked
to
learn
this
beer
is
7
abv
it
felt
a
lot
lighter
to
me
than
that
and
certainly
drinks
more
like
a
dry
irish
stout
at
4
than
it
does
as
a
foreign
style
so
strong
clean
looking
brew
medium
bodied
and
soil
brown
with
a
tall
head
thats
surprisingly
light
for
how
dark
the
liquid
is
smells
sweet
like
oats
and
has
less
roast
bitterness
than
most
there
are
some
hops
in
here
though
especially
in
the
finish
giving
a
bit
of
a
fruity
flavor
to
the
finish
the
way
lemon
zest
goes
in
espresso
similar
complexion
less
acidity
clean
feeling
beer
too
only
medium
bodied
and
slick
going
down
the
moderate
carbonation
is
plenty
the
big
flavors
do
the
talking
and
its
nice
to
listen
awhile
coffee
and
cocoa
in
the
finish
still
think
there
may
be
some
oats
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
fit
for
year
round
drinking
quite
a
bit
of
charroast
also
too
thin
this
is
a
serious
stuff
bold
and
impressive
flavors
but
i
have
to
say
that
the
drinkability
is
less
than
i
would
like
the
toasted
flavors
are
nice
but
the
darkness
obliterates
every
flavor
before
it
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
central
market
shoreline
in
north
seattle
harsh
roast
though
luckily
this
doesnt
get
acrid
thinner
but
very
drinkable
true
to
style
a
big
stout
with
contribution
from
pnw
hops
not
all
the
usual
ris
notes
creamy
some
red
berry
but
no
coffee
the
definition
of
american
stout
a
big
stout
without
teeth
crazy
roasted
and
definitely
drinkable
would
be
better
shared
overall
a
good
beer
which
meets
the
style
requirements
worth
a
try
and
has
a
nice
price
tag
i
think
this
is
cheaper
than
guinness
per
ounce
but
my
memory
seems
to
tag
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
as
being
slightly
better
o
if
it
wasnt
for
the
excessive
amount
of
heat
in
the
flavor
this
would
be
a
great
stout
somewhat
of
a
letdown
o
really
nice
stout
with
quite
a
bit
of
smokiness
that
made
for
a
very
nice
touch
more
smokiness
than
an
beer
outside
of
a
rauchbier
that
i
have
had
o
a
very
wellbrewed
little
stout
lots
of
character
and
everything
seems
to
work
towards
the
whole
drinks
easily
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
slight
coffee
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
cookie
dough
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
the
finish
is
quite
intense
like
a
very
strong
bitter
coffee
not
top
shelf
but
pretty
good
for
me
smoothe
across
the
tongue
damn
this
is
a
solid
example
of
a
stout
overallcomments
excellent
beer
very
well
balance
complex
flavor
and
aroma
profile
help
mask
the
alcohol
content
and
compliment
each
other
nicely
classified
as
a
foreignexport
stout
at
7
abv
consumed
on
1092012
o
roasty
smoothe
wet
and
enough
chocolatey
sweetness
to
balance
it
o
a
very
solid
and
flavorful
beer
i
can
understand
why
its
a
friend
of
mines
favorites
definitely
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
sure
to
please

overall
a
very
good
export
stout
i
like
the
fruit
character
of
the
flavor
and
its
overall
drinkability
would
definitely
have
again
drink
it
was
okay
well
it
was
better
than
that
but
think
i
am
being
critical
over
the
graininess
and
because
i
like
smooth
ris
and
dris
id
probably
have
this
again
o
if
carbonation
were
less
it
would
really
allow
for
the
roasted
grain
flavor
to
carry
through
and
finish
off
with
a
nice
smooth
flavor
instead
of
a
sharp
bitterness
o
great
finish
short
on
delivery
recommended
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
would
maybe
have
again
o
one
of
the
best
foreign
stouts
ive
had
knocks
the
socks
off
of
guinness
check
it
out
if
you
get
a
chance
m
being
an
export
stout
not
as
big
its
medium
leading
to
full
bodied
b
to
b
o
good
not
great
id
love
to
have
it
again
on
tap

ill
be
visiting

this
is
a
really
good

hope
to
find
more

this

an
excellent

great

quite
smooth

really
enjoyable
yeah
ill
pay
that
thats
really
powerful
and
unapologetic
and
it
works
as
it
is
i
can
imagine
you
could
make
an
imperial
version
of
this
that
id
enjoy
more
but
this
is
under
no
qualms
about
what
its
trying
to
do
and
for
that
its
successful
this
beer
wants
to
be
good
but
is
falling
short
with
some
apparent
oxidation
issues
flavor
is
ok
aroma
is
not
o
very
good
drinkable
and
good
representation
of
the
style
o

some
brighter
hops
on
the
finish
heavy
medium
body
with

and
a

bitterness
a
decent
beer
fairly
aggressively
roasted
and
hopped
for
the
style
but
it
works
o
my
glass
went
down
pretty
quickly
and
considering
that
i
dont
have
easy
access
to
this
beer
wish
that
hadnt
been
the
case
will
have
to
resist
the
urge
to
buy
this
at
the
expense
of
other
brand
new
beers
next
time
i
have
the
chance
to
pick
some
up
overall
a
really
solid
if
not
especially
complex
stout
from
pelican
closest
i
think
ive
come
to
a
session
stout
o
very
impressive
stout
i
consider
this
a
sipper
overall
tostyle
but
not
a
style
im
too
crazy
about
tsunami
stout
isnt
a
giant
wave
of
flavor
but
rather
a
smooth
rolling
tide
delivering
good
amounts
of
fruit
and
a
lot
of
chocolate
both
of
which
i
like
it
may
be
a
bit
thin
but
its
a
quality
foreign
export
pours
jet
black
with
a
deep
mocha
colored
quick
to
fade
headeven
when
held
to
the
light
nothing
gets
thru
this
body
coffee
roast
and
molasses
mainly
in
then
nosea
bit
of
rawness
to
it
not
as
creamy
and
full
as
the
label
suggestsits
not
thin
or
fizzy
but
not
quite
what
i
expected
earthy
and
roasted
flavors
with
mild
molasseslike
sweetnessits
a
litle
raw
in
the
finish
with
some
woody
tomes
its
pretty
good
but
not
greatthe
sweetness
creeps
up
more
as
i
drink
more
thick
black
with
you
nice
nitro
layering
of
the
creamy
caramel
colored
head
lots
of
settling
carbonation
and
great
head
retention
made
this
one
a
keeper
from
the
start
smell
was
nice
caramel
sugars
hints
of
roasted
chocolate
and
a
nice
nutty
presence
filtered
through
very
well
rounded
and
fresh
scent
the
taste
was
right
on
board
very
creamy
and
full
flavored
very
nice
smooth
feel
going
down
awesome
even
better
as
it
warmed
main
flavors
were
choclate
and
a
nice
caramel
sweetness
d
this
is
a
solid
stout
smells
and
tastes
great
with
a
classic
profile
easy
to
enjoy
without
being
too
sweet
or
thick
well
done
pelican
its
a
stout
its
decent
i
would
gladly
drink
one
again
if
offered
to
me
but
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
drinks
lighter
than
the
abv
and
initial
roastiness
would
indicate
a
very
nice
stout
o
not
bad
slightly
sweeter
and
thinner
body
for
the
style
than
expected
but
good
aroma
and
taste
that
follows
as
others
have
mentioned
the
taste
is
somewhat
betrayed
by
the
nose
there
is
not
quite
as
much
sweetness
in
this
stout
as
the
nose
implies
however
the
taste
is
wellbalanced
with
a
big
malt
flavor
and
subtle
hints
of
smoke
and
dark
chocolate
the
finish
is
bitter
but
once
again
balanced
enough
to
create
a
very
pleasing
overall
experience
this
is
a
wellcrafted
stout
that
i
will
definitely
drink
again
this
is
a
drinkable
export
stout
i
would
like
a
bit
more
chocolate
but
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
will
all
of
the
roasted
malts
is
dead
on
for
the
style
man
this
was
really
great
stout
full
flavored
as
heck
and
just
drenching
the
mouth
with
a
well
balanced
mix
of
sweetness
and
bitter
flavors
i
just
love
when
a
beer
that
you
didnt
have
many
expectations
for
just
blindsides
you
with
its
sheer
goodness
the
way
this
one
did
the
pelican
has
a
real
winner
here
with
this
one
o
overall
a
pretty
good
offering
from
pelican
not
my
favorite
thing
in
the
world
but
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
a
pretty
good
light
stout
lacks
the
tartness
and
depth
that
more
higher
gravity
stouts
possess
very
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
indescribably
drinkable
and
irresistible
this
is
like
guinness
foreign
extra
on
steroids
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
i
need
to
get
more
of
this
aroma
is
strong
and
oily
with
tones
of
coffee
and
unsweet
chocolate
and
an
overtone
of
molasses
it
pours
a
deep
warm
sable
with
a
thick
chocolaty
brown
head
would
have
gotten
a
perfect
score
in
this
department
if
the
head
had
been
a
little
more
persistent
flavor
is
smoky
and
sweet
tones
of
quality
coffee
molasses
and
licorice
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
texture
is
smooth
and
fizzy
a
teensy
thin
for
a
stout
but
still
good
overall
big
roasty
stout
good
stuff
the
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
moderate
to
maybe
a
little
above
average
overall
it
was
a
very
flavorful
easy
drinking
and
relatively
balanced
beer
for
the
style
a
very
enjoyable
stout
to
start
out
the
night
with
and
an
excellent
version
of
the
style
really
this
is
just
an
excellent
beer
from
pelican
brewing
oa
very
solid
example
of
a
foreign
stout
and
a
great
beer
ill
try
to
squeeze
some
more
of
this
from
my
good
friend
who
sent
this
my
way
thanks
again
for
everything
d
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
may
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
but
wouldnt
mind
a
couple
pints
on
tap
sometime
this
beer
pours
a
gorgeous
blackness
topped
off
by
a
nice
brown
foam
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
but
mostly
just
a
caramel
sweetness
the
flavor
is
composed
predominantly
of
caramel
some
dark
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
char
though
aside
from
malty
sweetness
and
caramel
flavoring
the
others
were
lost
in
the
fray
this
mouthfeel
i
had
anticipated
to
have
been
full
bodied
and
this
was
more
along
the
realm
of
medium
this
is
still
a
very
good
stout
to
drink
and
i
did
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
have
it
since
we
dont
get
too
much
oregonian
beer
in
chicago
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
but
not
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
dept
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
adequate
tsunami
stout
is
quite
drinkable
and
on
the
dry
side
the
7
abv
was
slightly
surprising
to
me
as
i
thought
this
one
was
actually
a
little
lower
than
that
a
very
nice
brew
but
look
out
for
ireland
from
a
bottle
pours
black
with
a
tight
creamy
cappuccino
head
really
nice
lacing
on
this
one
big
expressive
nose
full
of
dark
fruits
smokey
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
and
a
nice
rich
coffee
bean
presence
surprisingly
dry
in
the
mouth
with
the
dominant
flavor
being
rich
dry
just
slightly
bitter
coffee
beans
chocolate
is
completely
unsweetened
but
not
bitter
strange
mouth
feel
the
thing
is
big
but
it
really
dries
up
and
thins
out
a
bit
on
the
back
palate
finish
is
odd
and
almost
like
seltzer
water
this
is
a
strange
dichotomy
some
wonderful
rich
dry
qualities
but
this
completely
flat
thin
finish
but
as
a
foreign
stout
the
dry
relatively
light
body
works
well
overall
a
great
dry
stout
d
good
big
rich
dark
and
flavorful
definitely
not
too
heavy
i
could
easily
do
another
pint
this
is
a
medium
bodied
offering
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
what
is
strange
about
the
carbonation
is
that
it
doesnt
display
much
visually
but
when
the
brew
hits
your
tongue
it
is
overboard
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
forward
sweetness
the
finish
is
a
little
bitter
and
a
little
ashy
its
a
decent
beer
pretty
drinkable
but
a
little
thin
i
like
it
fes
are
all
about
like
this
sweeter
lighter
this
one
is
a
little
ashy
and
just
ok
poured
deathly
black
with
a
creamy
well
formed
light
tan
head
that
lasted
a
little
briefer
than
expected
even
though
i
ensured
the
glass
was
well
cleaned
in
my
gulden
draak
tulip
a
thin
cap
remained
offering
a
touch
of
lace
to
adorn
the
sides
letting
the
beer
air
out
a
bit
i
notice
the
aromas
are
remarkably
similar
to
the
taste
so
i
shall
combine
both
descriptions
deliciously
roasty
a
hint
of
ash
blended
nicely
with
chocolate
and
cream
the
black
patent
malt
is
definitely
in
there
which
is
what
gives
the
ashiness
and
slight
tannic
taste
a
delicately
sweet
molasses
finish
lasting
a
good
moment
before
giving
way
to
trails
of
bitters
the
texture
is
impeccable
i
find
no
faults
as
the
carbonation
is
absolutely
spot
on
lending
a
smooth
creamy
and
ever
so
slightly
prickling
character
to
the
mediumheavy
body
not
too
thick
so
it
does
not
enter
the
realm
of
what
i
could
consider
an
imperial
stout
this
beer
is
outstanding
one
of
the
best
stouts
out
there
it
would
pair
excellently
with
a
maduro
cigar
and
black
forest
cake
or
contrast
with
cannolis
either
way
damn
this
is
good
drinkability
quite
delicious
for
a
foreign
style
stout
good
coffee
notes
smooth
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
has
all
the
characteristics
of
an
ris
but
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
this
is
one
of
the
better
extra
stouts
i
have
had
this
year
overall
great
beer
from
pelican
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
from
oregon
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
and
cheaper
but
ill
still
seek
this
one
out
again
d
a
good
stout
but
not
a
great
one
it
pours
an
opaque
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
at
best
of
light
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
coffee
dark
roasted
malts
blackened
biscuits
charcoal
and
a
few
slow
viscous
drips
of
molasses
the
taste
still
has
strong
coffee
and
roasted
malt
notes
but
these
are
tempered
by
some
figs
dark
wheat
raisins
graham
crackers
and
dark
chocolate
powder
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
stout
a
pleasant
occasional
quaff
but
not
something
id
drink
regularly
d
easy
to
drink
but
the
bitter
burnt
taste
is
not
being
liked
the
restaurant
offers
a
tsunami
stout
float
on
the
desert
menu
vanilla
ice
cream
floating
in
this
beer
will
be
something
to
try
on
my
next
visit
oddly
enough
it
sounds
really
good
d
drinkable
tasty
approachable
stout
pours
pitch

with
a
light

with

with
a

this
is

i
got
this
bottle
as
part
of
a
trade
with
mikesgroove
thanks
mike
on
pouring
this
looks
like
its
gonna
be
good
dark
brownblack
with
a
tan
milk
chocolate
color
of
foam
thick
frothy
foam
too
really
nice
curb
appeal
moving
closer
roasted
malts
take
the
lead
in
aroma
supported
by
maybe
a
little
dark
chocolate
the
taste
is
just
as
advertised
sweet
malts
upfront
and
some
roasty
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
a
thick
body
forms
a
complement
to
the
richness
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
a
very
good
beer
overall
excellent
i
must
try
other
beers
from
pelican
its
a
good
stout
but
not
elite
mouthfeel
is
good
disclaimer
got
this
bomber
on
sale
at
3
original
price
7
without
having
any
preconceived
expectations
so
my
tastes
may
have
been
a
bit
skewed
because
of
that
however
this
was
a
great
stout
head
was
a
thick
tan
foam
of
sticky
goodness
color
was
midnight
black
aroma
and
taste
of
big
milk
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
medium
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
creamy
i
might
buy
this
again
at
7
but
at
3
im
going
to
pick
up
a
case
this
is
an
exceptional
stout
very
complex
but
imminently
drinkable
color
me
impressed
with
yet
another
pelican
brew
surprisingly
subtle
and
straightforward
the
name
had
me
expecting
a
big
imperial
leviathan
rather
than
a
polite
slow
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
biting
carbonation
good
but
a
bit
too
strong
for
a
stout
thanks
jeremy
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
a
pretty
damn
solid
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
almost
always
overlook
and
a
style
that
i
rarely
go
after
d
surprisingly
awesome
a
rare
big
yet
refreshing
stout
the
mouth
is
well
carbonated
and
could
be
turned
down
notch
but
it
has
some
nice
thickness
this
is
a
great
end
of
night
option
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
others
well
done
this
is
my
first
offering
from
pelican
and
i
want
more
pours
a
spongey
brown
three
finger
head
that
recedes
before
the
first
sip
very
slow
but
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
eventually
the
head
recedes
to
a
thin
film
and
ring
o
foam
aroma
of
brownies
with
just
a
little
espresso
and
some
hoppy
spice
taste
starts
fudgey
and
moves
to
more
bitter
dark
chocolate
with
just
a
faint
orange
rind
the
palate
finishes
with
burnt
malt
bitterness
very
malty
sweet
chocolatey
and
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
silky
smooth
start
to
the
palate
with
a
faintl
gristy
finish
pretty
good
stout
overall
drinkability
a
beer
i
could
definitely
enjoy
as
a
slow
sipper
for
one
or
two
maybe
less
of
a
session
beer
the
robust
but
simple
flavor
would
cease
to
interest
me
after
a
few
enjoyable
to
taste
but
honestly
22
oz
was
a
lot
to
put
down
the
taste
was
very
rich
the
hop
was
present
throughout
this
ones
a
sipper
schedule
some
time
to
work
through
it
its
worth
it
but
not
something
you
can
do
quickly
overall
this
is
a
very
nicely
balanced
stout
that
doesnt
try
and
cram
too
many
flavors
in
one
beer
worth
a
shot
pours
pitch
black
completely
opaque
with
a
huge
frothy
tan

quickly
dissipates
smells
of

raisins
make
up
the
nose
first
sip
the
strong
rich
coffee
teams
well
with
the
dark
roasted
malts
created
the
heart
of
this
beer
medium
bodied

well
carbonated

tasty

reminds
me
of

flavors
however
show
a

more
intensity
with
firm
maltiness
light
caramel
sweetness
with
most
of
the
emphasis
on
the

gives
the

a

light
and
airy

with
some
roasted

astringency
late
finishes
with
a

and
nonoffensive
a
pleasure
to

a
little
too
over
the
top
in
the

this

a
beer
to
try
andor

a

this
beer
is
quite
tasty
but
it
could
definitely
use
a
bit
more
general
malt
character
a
bit
thicker
and
maltier
would
make
this
beer
a
bit
more
balanced
but
then
it
would
be
a
bit
harder
to
get
through
a
22oz
bottle
as
this
beer
warms
up
a
bit
it
gains
a
bit
more
fullness
in
the
mouth
and
correspondingly
a
bit
more
malt
character
it
could
still
use
a

for
the
surprise
hookup
deep
black
color
with
a
thick
and
foamy
brown
head
that
dissipates
steadily
the
aroma
is
chocolate
and
malt
with
a
subtle
vinous
character
here
and
there
rich

with
a
nice
blend
of
coffee
and
cocoa
flavors
along
with
roasted

and

the

drinkability
hook
me
up
to
the
iv
this
is
great
wonderful
tasting
not
too
heavy
handed
very
well
done
strongly
recommended
my
friend
picked
this
up
for
me
from
the
pelican
he
raved
about
the
views
but
didnt
care
much
for
the
food
or
the
beer
so
far
ive
had
the
india
pelican
ale
which
i
didnt
rate
but
came
to
enjoy
after
it
warmed
and
the
malts
had
a
chance
to
beat
down
that
insane
hop
nose
and
finish
and
this
splendid
stout
im
hoping
his
culinary
experience
was
an
aberration
as
im
going
to
be
hitting
that
place
up
over
thanksgiving
and
i
refuse
to
leave
the
premises
without
at
least
four
bombers
of
this
excellent
stuff
and
one
of
the
best
new
to
me
stouts
ive
had
out
of
an
oregon
brewery
in
quite
some
time
had
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
july
2005
i
had
the
mega
pint
for
5
the
first
stip
reveals
a
strong
taste
of
coffee
and
roasted
flavors
a
typical
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
creamy
im
not
sure
of
the
abv
but
it
seemed
to
pack
a
little
bit
of
a
punch
maybe
because
i
hadnt
had
anything
to
eat
good
perhaps
a
little
overrated
but
a
decent
and
solid
stout
offering
who
knew
that
white
horses
is
another
name
for
a
tsunami
pelican
tsunami
stout
is
more
like
a
herd
of
big
black
arabian
horses
rampaging
across
the
taste
buds
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
foreignexport
stouts
nor
do
i
purport
to
understand
how
they
differ
from
other
stout
styles
what
i
do
know
is
that
this
beer
is
delicious
and
is
a
testament
to
the
skill
of
the
good
folks
at
pelican
pub
brewery
how
did
the
basement
pub
know
to
select
pelicans
two
best
brews
good
work
served
on

at
bones
very
black
and
opaque

colored
head
looked

roasted
coffee
aroma
lets
carry
the
whole
coffee
connection
throughout
the
review
tastewise
it
hought
it
was
coffee
like
all
the
way
no
room
for
cocoa
or
chocolate
notes
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
prickly
i
thought
this
was
a
well
made
brew
nothing
was
lacking
it
drinks
well
too

pelican
serves
this
on

through
a
spinner
at
their
brewpub
apparently
a
spinner
or
sparkler
is
a
type
of
agitator
that
attaches
to
the
tap
and
allows
greater
aeration
of
the
beer
as
it
flows
out
the
spigot
on

tsunami
is
liquid
black
pearls
though
ive
had
this
from
the
bottle
and
the
bottled
version
didnt
rock
my
world
nearly
so
forcefully
similar
to
shakespeare
stout
but
i
prefer
this
ink
black
with
brown
highlights
a
soft
and
substantial
head
forms
but
dwindles
to
a
ring
leaving
little
wisps
of
lace
down
the
glass
chocolatey
aroma
with
a
charcoal
roastiness
tsunami
stout
is
initially
quite
bitter
with
herbal
hops
leaping
across
the
tongue
they
are
soon
mellowed
by
the
full
thorough
roasty
quality
of
the
malts
evocative
of
both
the
salt
sprayed
air
of
the
oregon
coast
and
the
proliferation
nay
infestation
of
espresso
bars
throughout
the
northwest
slight
flecks
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
licorice
and
raisin
flavors
soon
fall
by
the
wayside
as
the
hop
bitterness
returns
to
pair
up
with
the
burnt
huge
malts
aftertaste
is
creamy
chocolatey
balanced
by
slight
mint
and
pine
hop
qualities
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
just
the
right
amount
of
slippery
drinkability
a
bit
low
for
me
as
with
many
serious
stouts
patience
is
rewarded
and
haste
makes
for
unneccesary
and
unwelcome
waste
wow
what
a
nice
roasty
beer
from
skyhand
pours
with
a
nice
whipped
cream
tan
head
pitch
black
body
as
should
come
from
a
stout
almost
but
not
quite
overpoweringly
roastly
flavor
this
flavor
is
right
on
the
edge
for
me
its
there
but
not
over
the
top
a
great
potential
session
beer
overall
a
darn
good
beer

anyone

of

full
beautiful
flavor
woody
chocolate
toasted
nuts
with
a
well
blended
bitterness
that
is
there
but
not
biting
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
of
this
complexity
the
stream
from
the
bottle
is
a
cola
brown
that
turns
into
black
in
the
glass
the
head
is
a
nice
size
dense
a
good
medium
tan
that
lasts
as
a
fuzzy
film
and
laces
nicely
the
aroma
is
almost
spot
on
great
coffee
and
chocolate
nose
with
the
java
being
dominant
hops
are
present
in
the
aroma
but
more
so
in
the
flavor
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
the
aromas
promise
being
a
little
overwhelmed
by
the
hops
still
an
excellent
stout
though
still
dark
acidic
and
bittersweet
full
of
lasting
flavor
too
the
name
however
had
me
anticipating
a
monsoon
of
flavor
like
an
imperial
stout
and
that
is
not
the
case
an
excellent
regular
stout
shall
we
say
but
one
still
abundant
with
flavor
quite
nice
actually
and
remarkably
similar
to
guinness
extra
stout
this
is
a
very
good
smooth
stout
without
any
bitter
bite
i
lugged
this
one
all
the
way
across
the
country
with
me
from

it

i
am

impressed
by
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
really
a
solid
roasty
coffee
stout
m
full

more
delicious

in

with
roasted

pours
nearblack
with
a
thin
light

quickly

a
slight
cherry

along

roast
finishing
with
some
dark
chocolate
body
is
medium
to
a
slightlydry
finish
pretty
good
maybe
more
creamerlike
qualities
and
a
bigger
body
would
have
helped
me
enjoy
this
offering
more
as
it
stands
it
is
a
serviceable
beer
but
not
one
i
will
be
pining
for
again
o
this
is
a
great
coffee
stout
from
the
brau
bros
i
may
be
close
to
my
last
bottle
on
this
one
and
im
likely
gonna
pick
up
more
this
was
a
homerun
in
my
opinion
if
your
looking
for
coffee
as
far
as
coffee
flavor
goes
i
would
say
this
rivals
the
coveted
coffee
bender
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
coffee
stout
the
cherry
flavor
blends
in
very
well
with
the
coffee
and
dark
malts
overall
this
was
the
best
thing
to
ever
come
out
of
lucan
this
beer
was
pretty
solid
and
enjoyable
i
havent
had
much
that
i
have
enjoyed
from
brau
but
this
was
tasty
a
little
too
roasty
but
other
than
that
it
was
good
overall
a
decent
enough
stab
at
the
style
though
there
is
not
enough
coffee
and
the
acidity
is
problematic
o
an
enjoyable
coffee
stout
not
as
complex
or
creamy
as
my
favorite
coffee
stouts
but
i
enjoyed
this
not
the
best
coffee
beer
on
the
shelves
but
there
are
definately
many
a
lot
worse
probably
will
not
replace
redband
stout
as
an
affordable
coffee
beer
overall
a
beer
that
looks
and
smells
great
then
kind
of
wanes
a
bit
jagged
and
disconnected
but
does
have
quality
framework
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
only
bought
a
single
3
o
im
rather
disappointed
in
this
beer
surly
coffee
bender
or
bells
java
stout
both
annihilate
this
its
not
even
close
the
coffee
is
way
too
bland
to
be
called
a
coffee
stout
its
not
an
entirely
gross
beer
but
there
are
1000
other
stouts
i
would
rather
have
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
if
coffee
bender
is
an
option
i
like
to
say
all
the
best
things
to
drink
are
brewed
teas
coffee
and
beer
coffee
beers
are
a
great
combination
of
two
great
beverages
brau
bros
has
a
solid
rendition
of
this
compared
to
the
breakfast
stout
i
had
days
ago
i
feel
the
bros
missed
the
stout
mark
it
was
more
like
a
coffee
bender
with
a
bit
higher
abv
only
flaw
for
me
is
it
could
be
fuller
bodied
a
bit
more
thickness
would
go
a
long
way
aint
nothing
wrong
with
it
it
just
has
a
little
bit
to
go
finally
finally
i
have
had
a
beer
from
brau
that
i
enjoyed
i
am
still
not
sure
about
the
earthy
soily
taste
in
the
beer
but
i
would
buy
cherry
bean
coffee
stout
again
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
nearly
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
light
tan
foam
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
balance
of
roasted
malt
graham
cracker
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
no
one
aspect
of
the
aroma
stands
out
as
overpowering
any
other
aspect
which
creates
some
nice
complexity
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
coffee
coming
through
slightly
stronger
but
still
not
over
powering
any
of
the
other
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
fuller
than
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
silky
texture
overall
this
is
a
really
good
coffee
stout
that
i
will
be
drinking
a
lot
of
o
need
more
coffee
a
little
disappointing
very
impressed
by
this
brew
as
i
am
with
all
from
brau
very
smooth
and
too
easy
to
drink
as
it
has
no
booziness
at
all
highly
recommend
and
i
will
be
making
a
trip
to
taylors
to
pickup
six
of
these
real
soon
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
highlights
coffee
well
drinks
very
well
also
i
think
i
would
like
this
beer
better
if
the
malt
and
sweetness
were
bumped
up
a
hair
as
it
stands
though
this
is
a
very
well
done
coffee
beer
real
chocolatey
made
me
wanting
more
o
beautiful
tassie
one
of
my
favourite
places
on
the
planet
but
not
for
the
beer
food
match
ideal
main
course
would
be
a
hearty
beef
stew
with
a
chocolate
caketartpudding
for
dessert
overall
the
finish
is
kind
of
a
deal
breaker
for
me
i
like
the
aroma
appearance
and
the
first
23rds
of
the
taste
i
picked
this
up
a
few
years
back
in
new
zealand
on
my
way
down
to
antarctica
i
remember
thinking
it
was
much
better
than
the
light
lagers
we
had
access
to
down
at
mcmurdo
station
i
still
think
it
is
a
solid
beer
though
by
no
means
an
import
stout
really
this
falls
somewhere
between
a
stout
and
a
black
ale
with
the
simpler
flavor
profile
and
lighter
mouthfeel
compared
to
a
traditional
stout
still
it
hits
the
spot
and
is
highly
drinkable
i
would
get
a
few
sixes
about
10
each
of
this
if
i
get
the
chance
to
go
back
to
the
ice
o
nice
stout
but
seems
to
be
a
bit
lacking
in
richness
and
character
overall
not
too
bad
especially
from
a
macro
brewery
that
normally
produces
standard
adjunct
lagers
but
not
nearly
as
fullbodied
and
complex
as
a
good
stout
should
be
definitely
more
of
a
sessionable
stout
o
an
example
of
what
an
average
australian
thinks
a
stout
should
be
coffee
roasted
malt
and
a
milky
mouth
feel
that
completely
confuses
with
a
super
dryness
sucking
your
face
off
going
in
for
another
drink
is
the
only
way
to
remove
the
barren
milk
scum
feel
followed
swiftly
by
the
cold
coffee
and
burnt
malt
desperate
times
call
for
desperate
measures
it
seems
havnt
had
this
for
ages
and
after
going
to
my
nearest
country
local
there
was
not
too
many
dark
options
anyway
it
pours
a
dark
black
hue
with
a
fast
vanishing
two
finger
head
and
hardly
any
lacingthe
smell
is
roasted
barleytoasty
maltsa
slight
fruitinesskola
and
dark
cocoa
nibsthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
suprisingly
not
as
bad
as
i
remember
although
i
do
like
a
thicker
mouthfeel
in
my
stouts
but
for
a
macro
effort
not
badthe
tastes
are
pretty
simple
with
hints
of
roasted
barleyblack
coffee
with
no
milka
herbal
fruitiness
and
finished
with
a
dark
chocolate
bittersweetness
and
overall
its
average
but
alot
better
than
i
remember
it
being
and
i
am
just
glad
that
the
macro
squad
have
not
forgotten
their
dark
beer
lovers
as
its
definately
a
better
option
when
faced
with
only
a
macro
range
as
there
is
def
more
to
it
than
their
usual
lineup
cheers
all
in
all
a
good
stout
for
abv
if
not
great
far
too
onedimensional
od
fairly
typical
of
a
commercial
stout
a
good
alternative
to
a
macro
lager
but
no
more
wouldnt
get
it
again
unless
nothing
else
interesting
was
available
d
at
5
8
it
is
very
drinkable
it
is
a
bit
hard
to
find
as
coopers
stout
really
dominates
the
market
in
australia
still
this
is
a
good
stout
it
has
some
weak
points
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
stout
a
workable
offering
from
one
of
the
big
breweries
in
australia
with
a
little
more
body
this
would
be
very
good
o
i
like
it
easy
to
drink
and
nicely
warming
on
a
cold
winters
night
its
nothing
exceptional
but
honestly
i
really
didnt
expect
a
whole
lot
that
being
said
this
is
a
fine
effort
from
cascade
o
this
stout
suprised
me
a
lot
and
is
probably
just
behind
southwarks
and
coopers
best
extra
as
the
best
off
the
shelf
mass
produced
stout
in
australia
a
decent
commercial
stout
nothing
special
but
certainly
not
bad
decent
enough
and
surprisingly
easy
to
find
in
the
more
generic
pubs
in
hobart
wish
there
was
such
a
good
option
readily
available
in
the
shite
pubs
i
occasionally
have
to
visit
in
sydney
its
a
bit
too
spritzy
for
my
liking
i
find
the
mouthfeel
really
detracts
from
the
good
flavours
a
smooth
drinkable
stout
and
i
must
say
a
pleasant
surprise
from
cascade
its
a
bit
mild
for
a
stout
but
that
just
makes
it
more
palatable
good
effort
ive
said
it
before
i
am
not
a
stout
drinker
i
would
choose
a
porter
over
a
dry
stout
any
day
that
said
i
still
think
this
qualifies
as
subpar
it
only
really
has
one
flaw
but
that
flaw
overly
burnt
bitterness
completely
ruins
the
beer
for
me
its
not
priced
badly
but
after
this
experience
i
probably
wont
be
getting
it
again
pours
a
very
thick
dark
blackbrown
i
cant
see
any
light
through
it
at
all
theres
also
about
an
inch
and
a
half
of
creamy
tan
head
that
fades
away
to
leave
a
nice
layer
that
clings
to
the
glass
smells
very
chocolatey
and
coffeeish
a
nice
roast
aroma
the
taste
also
has
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
coffee
in
it
and
some
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
watery
and
a
little
harsh
all
in
all
its
a
really
drinkable
stout
the
price
is
right
id
probably
get
this
again
this
one
was
hard
for
me
to
really
the
whole
mix
was
just
too
bitter
maybe
too
much
carbonization
or
a
caramel
malt
might
smooth
it
over
label
810
very
smooth
good
carbonation
decent
brew
id
try
it
again
as
it
goes
down
smooth
thanks
sammy
black
with

in

some

in

drinkable
reasonable
stout
thanks
douglasd
for
bringing
back
m
pass
on
this
light
beer
posing
as
a
craft
beer
stout
this
would
be
a
bit
better
than
the
export
stout
but
only
just
id
put
this
beer
just
over
medium
in
terms
of
body
a
very
good
structure
for
all
the
flavors
going
on
here
almost
no
trace
of
alcohol
but
tons
of
flavor
which
is
always
a
great
combination
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
when
i
return
to
charleston
o
overall
not
my
favorite
offering
from
coast
interesting
though
and
worth
a
try
i
remember
liking
it
a
lot
more
the
last
time
i
had
it
last
year
poured
on
tap
and
paired
with
food
id
drink
this
again
but
its
not
something
i
will
run
out
and
by
another
growler
of
o
this
was
a
delicious
and
very
unique
stout
when
i
heard
the
words
oyster
stout
i
was
skeptical
i
thought
that
the
oyster
presence
would
be
either
nonexistent
or
overpowering
while
i
do
like
oysters
a
beer
with
an
overpowering
oyster
flavor
does
not
sound
appetizing
coast
did
a
great
job
of
making
a
good
stout
and
adding
just
enough
oysters
to
give
them
a
subtle
but
noticeable
presence
the
body
was
a
bit
too
thin
but
thats
pretty
much
the
only
complaint
i
have
about
this
beer
definitely
glad
i
picked
it
up
cheers
coast
brewing
company
brews
impressive
beer
i
knew
this
would
be
good
but
i
really
wasnt
expecting
the
oyster
aspect
of
it
to
really
shine
through
lo
and
beholdit
does
who
knew
if
youre
into
all
things
stout
and
saltgive
this
one
a
shot
it
delivers
thanks
dan
o
another
great
beer
from
coast
using
local
oysters
is
pretty
badass
and
this
beer
shows
their
ability
to
do
great
things
on
the
dark
malt
side
of
the
street
taste
is
of
very
roasted
creamy
malts
mixed
with
some
slight
coffee
but
here
is
where
it
gets
interesting
i
actually
taste
the
oysters
it
has
a
very
very
slight
fishy
salty
sea
water
flavor
it
sounds
kind
of
gross
but
its
very
well
balanced
and
not
in
your
face
it
is
full
of
flavor
and
actually
has
some
alcohol
for
a
stout
nice
job
overall
the
cask
really
works
for
this
beer
as
all
of
the
elements
present
themselves
without
the
interruption
of
too
much
carbonation
really
like
the
surprisingly
hoppy
flavors
as
well
as
the
brine
in
the
aftertaste
also
for
you
oyster
lovers
out
there
and
the
adventureous
drinkers
cassino
and
i
decided
to
experiment
on
our
second
pints
of
this
brew
with
an
empty
glass
we
lined
the
bottom
of
the
glass
with
texas
pete
and
then
poured
the
beer
into
the
glass
this
added
a
very
nice
spicy
tabasco
aspect
to
the
brew
on
the
followthrough
only
and
made
it
quite
enjoyable
we
also
shared
tastes
with
others
sitting
at
the
bar
and
everyone
really
seemed
to
like
it
add
at
your
own
risk
and
based
on
your
spice
tolerance
mine
is
higher
than
most
coast
are
you
listening
get
tabasco
barrels
and
put
this
beer
in
them
i
will
definitely
thank
you
for
this
overall
very
solid
and
really
quite
nicely
done
i
have
to
admit
name
alone
scared
me
off
but
there
was
no
reason
for
it
this
was
just
a
nicely
done
stout
all
the
way
around
drinkability
this
beer
was
very
enjoybable
from
start
to
finish
as
it
went
down
fairly
quickly
i
was
able
to
have
enjoy
this
on
several
evenings
while
in
sc
and
was
the
favorite
beer
on
my
trip
black
body
with
a
dark
brown
head
resting
on
top
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
but
eventually
runs
away
smells
roasty
with
hints
of
mineral
notes
but
nothing
that
screams
oysters
tastes
roasty
again
but
with
a
definite
mineral
presence
slightly
sweet
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
heavy
very
sticky
in
the
mouth
pretty
easy
drinking
as
the
abv
would
indicate
not
much
about
this
screams
oyster
to
me
but
i
think
it
is
noticeable
once
it
is
mentioned
i
wish
there
was
a
place
near
me
that
i
could
enjoy
this
with
some
oysters
id
buy
this
again
another
solid
offering
from
coast
their
stouts
are
always
top
notch
d
very
drinkable
just
like
every
other
coast
offering
ill
have
no
problem
with
this
growler
i
was
really
excited
when
i
first
heard
of
this
brew
glad
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
drinkability
very
drinkable
the
creamy
texture
and
abv
makes
for
a
very
rich
yet
easy
drinking
offering
ive
compared
this
to
other
oyster
stouts
and
this
is
very
much
one
i
enjoy
well
done
coast
dmore
enjoyable
than
some
of
the
off
styles
you
see
interesting
and
controlled
enough
to
not
get
bored
with
trying
to
tease
out
the
flavors
i
found
myself
wanting
a
second
glass
and
then
a
third
m
just
under
medium
bodied
smooth
a
wonderful
roasty
mineral
briney
goodness
on
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
the
local
oysters
brought
a
nice
dry
brine
on
the
finish
to
a
well
balanced
huge
roasty
grain
bill
outstanding
brew
here
huge
chewy
creamy
mouthfeel
that
was
a
pleasure
to
consume
i
found
this
to
be
highly
drinkable
bravo
to
the
good
folk
at
coast
o
winner
o
overall
a
very
nice
foreign
export
stout
reminds
me
a
bit
of
shorts
uncle
steves
irish
stout
but
better
very
good
take
on
the
style
from
a
local
brewery
would
be
more
than
happy
to
have
this
again
worthy
o
overall
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
i
thought
it
was
a
great
sweet
stout
the
nose
is
great
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
id
love
to
have
this
one
again
and
look
forward
to
trying
mroe
of
their
beers
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
brew
was
the
aroma
it
was
rich
and
bold
boasting
of
big
roasted
malts
and
huge
coffee
elements
these
elements
however
were
blended
perfectly
with
a
cooling
vanilla
leading
to
a
complex
and
mouthwatering
aroma
that
fit
this
style
perfectly
where
the
beer
lost
points
however
was
in
the
mouthfeel
we
were
expecting
something
rich
bold
and
full
bodied
but
instead
were
met
with
a
rather
thin
and
watery
brew
o
a
delicious
brew
on
cask
just
a
touch
too
light
on
the
body
into
the
tulip
the
blackness
tumbles
further
down
the
rabbit
hole
a
black
hole
of
despair
and
neglect
but
this
glass
i
shall
neglect
not
i
raise
it
to
the
light
impenetrable
i
smell
the
roast
the
coffee
a
faintness
of
hop
of
hope
big
creamy
tan
head
the
bubbles
fine
the
flavor
is
nice
the
creaminess
of
the
stout
is
cut
with
the
bitterness
and
roasted
barley
a
little
coffee
rounds
out
an
excellent
stout
flavor
fullbodied
very
creamy
despite
the
sharp
notes
of
bitterness
from
hop
and
husk
an
extremely
solid
brew
from
the
local
cats
o
the
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
for
the
style
because
it
isnt
very
heavy
on
the
palate
o
an
excellent
stout
very
glad
i
stumbled
upon
this
one
pretty
straightforward
but
who
says
thats
a
bad
thing
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
bitter
and
chewy
with
some
tobacco
and
roast
d
very
good
brew
and
very
drinkable
would
definitely
like
to
have
one
again
d
smoke
is
the
main
thing
here
but
unlike
lesser
versions
of
the
style
it
doesnt
get
overwhelming
and
disgusting
it
perhaps
could
have
benefited
from
a
nicer
complement
of
secondary
flavors
but
it
was
pleasant
enough
a
massive
stout
this
one
is
not
screwing
around
like
guinness
foreign
extra
on
roids
could
use
a
bit
of
restraint
i
think
but
shows
off
american
boisterousness
well
tastes
strong
hoppiness
with
supporting
malt
sweet
malt
sweet
is
cut
a
bit
short
due
to
an
alcohol
sting
upon
the
swallow
hop
flavor
is
grassy
with
blackberry
and
anise
malt
is
tame
roast
and
dry
cocoa
cherry
ester
in
the
finish
and
ashy
aftertaste
much
too
hoppy
for
the
style
but
still
a
nice
beer
thick
in
the
mouth
but
doesnt
cling
on
the
tongue
due
to
the
alcohol
medium
carbonation
and
decent
drinkability
d
this
has
been
my
favorite
offering
from
cbc
i
wouldnt
normally
pick
a
stout
for
a
hot
humid
nyc
summers
daynight
but
my
wife
was
in
the
mood
im
glad
she
was
this
is
a
unique
stout
that
stands
out
to
me
with
the
sourishbarrelish
notes
to
it
this
beer
pours
a
very
black
color
hard
to
even
get
highlights
when
backlit
the
dark
tan
head
fades
to
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
the
aroma
is
nicely
toasted
with
the
8
0
abv
not
really
making
much
of
a
showing
the
taste
has
a
good
malty
backbone
with
a
dry
finish
the
full
body
and
well
all
the
malt
makes
this
my
favorite
chelsea
beer
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
an
awesome
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
dry
roasted
scent
that
boasts
of
chocolate
and
patent
malts
there
is
also
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
great
it
has
quite
a
blackroasted
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
and
finishes
with
an
earthy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
well
brewed
stout
with
loads
of
roasted
character
drinkability
it
sure
goes
down
easy
and
is
tasty
as
hell
what
a
wonderful
foreignexport
stout
you
guys
in
nyc
have
it
made
oh
and
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
some
nice
lacing
thanks
again
go
out
to
nutbrown
d
pretty
easy
drinking
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
vs
cask
i
feel
like
a
lot
of
the
flavor
was
lost
from
the
gravity
cask
notes
from
91705
d
nice
job
on
this
solid
stout
that
is
pretty
complex
and
tasty
congrats
to
chelsea
on
the
bronze
medal
at
the
2008
gabf
overall
this
was
more
than
a
solid
brew
however
not
my
favorite
offering
from
chelsea
and
theyve
proven
they
can
do
better
damn
my
expectations
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
readily
available
would
like
to
do
the
whole
formal
description
but
this
deserves
the
ultimate
resepect
simple
appreciation
without
over

3
best
stouts
i
have
ever
yes
ever
had
overall
a
nice
sipper
also
had
this
gem
at
the
recent
manhattan
cask
fest
thanks
alex
and
it
was
even
smoother
and
tastier
pours
a
matte
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
is
very
thick
easily
one
of
the
best
heads
i
have
ever
seen
it
smells
heavily
of
coffee
caramel
and
burnt
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
of
very
dark
chocolate
dark
fruits
roasted
coffee
beans
and
caramel
again
it
has
a
nice
hoppiness
to
it
that
greatly
distinguishes
it
from
the
other
export
stouts
it
is
super
silky
in
the
mouth
delicious
beer
drinkability
this
was
a
nice
hearty
stout
after
spending
a
cold
day
in
nyc
this
one
is
worth
having
when
it
is
on
tap
d
very
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
will
eventually
get
to
you
overall
a
delicious
and
perfectly
crafted
stout
not
as
rigid
as
most
exports
looks
jet
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
some
lacing
as
i
drink
the
aroma
was
of
a
simple
stout
just
some
dark
roasted
grains
but
the
flavor
opened
up
to
a
lot
more
with
sweet
chocolate
a
bitter
roasted
grains
element
that
stayed
with
you
in
a
good
way
as
it
warmed
some
citrus
hops
came
in
ala
shakespeare
stout
all
in
all
this
was
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
stout
definitely
worth
trying
in
nyc

a
little
sweet
but

i
wish
they
brewed
this
one
a
bit
more
often
cheers
to
a
local
brewery
for
a
great
beer
drinkability
its
a
wellrounded
big
stout
excellent
with
a
desert
or
just
as
a
nice
evening
wintertime
snack
although
its
not
the
greatest
stout
theres
something
unique
about
that
i
enjoyed
maybe
someday
it
will
come
to
me
and
ill
be
able
to
point
to
what
made
it
different
definitely
worth
a
try
oncask
at
copperfields
a
dark
nearly
opaque
black
colour
with
a
small
offwhite
head
that
did
not
last
long
the
aromas
were
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
a
bit
of
coffee
some
vanilla
a
bit
of
oak
and
more
the
taste
was
very
roasty
up
front
but
very
sweet
and
chocolatelike
in
the
finish
although
this
was
not
a
very
hoppy
stout
the
small
hop
flavors
that
were
there
complemented
the
other
flavors
in
this
beer
quite
well
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
but
the
drinkability
was
very
very
good
i
want
some
more
beers
from
chelsea
now
please
overally
i
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
like
all
of
chelseas
beers
this
beer
is
superclean
very
attenuated
and
has
lots
of
flavor
hops
a
slice
of
california
in
nyc
taste
is
fantastic
leaves
your
tongue
swimming
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
an
appropriate
name
for
this
brew
it
pours
the
darkest
shade
of
indigo
with
a
toffey
head
and
noticeable
lacing
throughout
the
sipping
experience
roasted
malty
aroma
with
a
fruity
plum
taste
an
unmistakable
and
pleasurable
sweetness
not
overpowering
sweetness
but
truly
enjoyable
as
the
brew
warms
and
releases
it
true
taste
i
plan
to
finish
the
growler
this
evening
with
a
turkey
hoagie
and
a
nice
cigar
very
yummy
sip
this
one
and
let
it
warm
up
a
bit

great
stout
with
tones
of
carmel
and
a
nice
roast
finish
eat
with
ribs
it
is
amazing
overall
good
solid
stout
but
again
the
roasted
malt
is
a
little
too
intense
if
it
were
just
a
little
more
mellow
in
that
department
itd
be
outstanding
right
when
i
opened
the
can
and
got
a
smell
of
the
rich
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
aromas
i
knew
i
should
have
purchased
more
perhaps
i
can
find
more
before
i
return
to
the
east
but
at
least
i
know
snake
river
is
holding
down
wy
very
well
i
hope
to
find
myself
at
the
brewpub
again
in
the
next
few
years
between
this
and
pakos
wy
is
doing
just
fine
flavor
dark
coffee
roasted
malts
dominate
with
some
earthy
and
peppery
hops
backbone
pumped
to
review
my
first
brew
from
wyoming
export
and
irish
stouts
are
not
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
but
id
say
this
is
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
style
overall
this
is
my
new
favorite
stout
simply
fantastic
i
can
easily
see
why
it
has
won
so
many
awards
this
review
does
the
beer
no
justice
but
just
a
great
everyday
readily
available
go
to
stout
overall
fantastic
overall
great
semisweet
chocolate
with
coffee
and
caramel
hints
well
balanced
creamy
and
easy
drinking
overall
this
is
an
amazing
stout
i
initially
tried
this
one
ten
years
ago
and
did
not
like
it
for
some
reason
this
was
before
i
really
knew
anything
about
quality
beer
i
missed
a
lot
of
time
enjoying
this
beer
and
now
i
need
to
try
to
make
that
up
again
this
is
an
instant
buy
any
time
i
see
it
all
of
this
in
a
regular
release
canned
beer
it
does
not
get
much
better
would
always
have
one
of
these
worth
trying
o
a
very
tasty
stout
that
offers
perfect
bitter
notes
while
balancing
them
out
with
large
amounts
of
malts
o
i
cannot
recall
a
beer
ive
enjoyed
more
from
the
state
of
wyoming
the
zonker
is
quite
tasty
and
definitely
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
dark
with
ecru
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
scent
carries
dark
chocolate
and
roast
the
taste
has
a
mild
espresso
with
semisweet
chocolate
tones
that
makes
for
a
very
good
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
i
would
like
a
bit
more
body
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
and
i
could
session
this
mofo
o
a
pretty
tasty
american
stout
that
i
keep
being
inclined
to
call
thin
even
though
it
isnt
it
has
good
balance
with
a
nice
mix
of
dark
malt
flavors
good
enough
that
ill
seek
out
other
beers
from
the
brew
when
possible
overall
a
very
well
made
stout
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
is
well
balanced
and
has
a
moderate
abv
making
it
pretty
darn
close
to
being
sessionable
for
me
i
like
the
roasted
flavors
of
the
malts
and
it
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
thick
heavy
molasses
on
this
one
wads
of
malts
tons
of
em
toasted
tones
on
here
as
an
accent
this
is
one
thick
and
consistent
beer
that
truly
holds
to
style
surprised
to
be
getting
what
i
did
and
happy
to
have
done
so
highly
suggested
overall
this
beer
is
very
nice
balance
and
solid
flavor
could
be
heavier
on
the
abv
but
6
is
right
down
the
middle
and
the
flavor
really
comes
through
nice
worth
a
try
most
definitely
od
a
well
done
stout
a
very
quaffable
and
easy
drinking
beer
not
very
filling
abv
is
not
out
of
line
recommended
overall
this
is
such
a
drinkable
beer
i
would
compare
it
to
ten
fidy
in
that
why
wouldnt
you
pick
some
up
when
it
is
on
the
shelf
o
for
a
beer
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
really
packed
with
flavors
and
has
a
nice
balance
so
that
the
roasted
malts
are
not
too
strong
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
or
the
beer
year
round
o
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
well
balanced
in
terms
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
on
the
palate
o
certainly
a
stout
that
pushes
to
the
extreme
of
smoke
and
char
its
pervasive
in
every
aspect
of
the
beer
they
made
it
smooth
enough
and
just
sweet
enough
to
keep
it
from
tasting
like
a
campfire
however
which
is
a
feat
in
itself
definitely
packs
a
big
roasted
malt
character
for
such
a
light
beer
o
wow
this
is
one
of
the
best
regular
stouts
i
have
had
dont
have
anything
bad
to
say
but
think
i
need
to
seek
out
more
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
american
stout
not
great
not
bad
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
i
love
lower
abv
stouts
that
are
huge
on
flavor
and
this
beer
is
perfect
of
that
o
just
as
good
as
i
remembered
still
blown
away
by
this
beer
snake
river
needs
to
start
getting
beer
on

really
great
example
of
the
style
carries
just
a
bit
of
that
irish
cream
char
thing
that
i
love
about
the
style
much
richer
than
most
others
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
really
just
a
wonderful
beer
glad
to
have
a
6er
of
these
but
i
dont
envision
them
lasting
long
ov
one
of
the
best
foreign
style
stouts
ive
had
a
treat
to
have
definitely
recommended
pours
a

with
a
rich

with

followed
by
some
rich

o
nothing
amazing
going
on
here
just
a
good
solid
beer
that
drinks
well
if
they
distributed
to
michigan
id
certainly
buy
more
overall
zonker
has
a
lot
of
great
things
going
on
the
well
balanced
flavors
on
the
palate
the
almost
perfect
mouth
feel
are
the
great
things
about
this
beer
if
only
the
nose
was
a
little
bit
better
do
damn
this
is
a
good
beer
couldnt
find
one
flaw

my
typeabeer
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
of
this
gotta
get
my
people
some
overall
it
is
a
great
stout
though
the
mouthfeel
was
offstyle
at
6
this
drinks
creamy
and
medium
bodied
this
does
not
fall
prey
to
the
shortcomings
of
some
regular
stouts
that
fail
to
have
the
body
to
carry
the
weight
of
the
flavors
and
expectations
carbonation
is
prickly
but
complimentary
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
stout
i
quite
enjoyed
my
quick
visit
to
the
brewpub
earlier
this
summer
nice
now
to
try
one
of
their
brews
more
tailored
to
a
winter
climate
as
ours
closes

fairly
smooth

but
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
body
not
going
to
lie
when
i
drank
this
i
was
under
the
impression
that
it
was
a
regular
american
stout
and
wasnt
overly
impressed
once
i
found
out
it
was
brewed
as
an
export
stout
though
my
estimation
of
it
went
up
quite
a
ways
i
ended
up
increasing
my
score
a
pretty
decent
amount
overall
a
pretty
damn
solid
export
stout
that
i
would
have
again

this

i
go

and
i
always
grab
a
6pack
when
im
there
i
dont
know
much
about
the
foreign

but
i
imagine
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
overall
fantastically
smooth

drinkable
keep
em
coming
drink
glad
i
got
to
try
it
and
tick
off

was
a
bit
spritzy
and
bitter
for
me
but
seeing
as
its
a
foreign
export
kind
of
expected
that
ogreat
brew
will
be
searching
it
out
for
sure
overall
foreignexport
stouts
are
not
really
my
thing
but
it
fits
the
style
category
perfectly
also
this
is
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
the
cpj
overall
this
was
an
amazing
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
i
will
definitely
seek
this
one
again
overall
its
just
wonderful
and
enjoyable
in
every
way
at

i
would
have
this
all
the

moderate
amount

a
thin
collar
throughout
the
nose
is
roasty
and
dry
with
some
coffee
notes
and
a
bit
of
dry
chocolate
taste
is
an
improvement
from
there
with
the
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
all
bringing
dryness
but
not
taking
it
over
the
edge
the
fact
that
it
gets
a
4

here
is
all
the
more
impressive
given
that
someone
mentioned
two
girls
one
cup
while
we
were
drinking
this
finish

dry
after
a

beer
nice
and
drinkable
glad
we
ordered
this
the
beer
appears
a
near
black
shade
in
the
body
with
a
dark
brown
hue
near
the
crest
the
beige
head
is
a
finger
thick
and
leaves
a
good
trail
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
roasty
with
scents
of
chocolate
in
there
as
well
very
pleasant
tasting
with
a
good
balance
of
roast
and
chocolate
flavors
medium
bodied
and
smooth
this
beer
has
a
nice
feel
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
i
would
certainly
have
this
again
beer
is
nice
and
smooth
mild
bitterness
at
the
end
with
a
shadow
of
an
aftertaste
on
the
finish
the
beer
is
mildly
sweet
at
the
lead
off
and
the
midpalate
has
this
nice
chocolate
to
it
the
finish
is
gradual
creeping
up
after
the
swallow
with
a
little
late
ashiness
its
a
good
beer
d
goes
down
easy
a
solid
stout
for
sure
i
would
drink
this
again
anytime
and
would
purchase
more
if
i
had
the
chance
as
it
warmed
more
dark
fruit
made
a
presence
making
it
more
true
to
its
labeled
style
the
mouth
starts
and
continues
smooth
the
taste
is
a
sweet
stout
starts
with
a
creamy
chocolate
taste
and
has
a
slightly
roasted
taste
in
the
middle
it
finishes
with
only
a
slight
roasted
taste
that
lingers
nice
is
definitely
better
on
draft
but
still
one
of
the
best
stouts
d
its
both
strong
and
robust
perfect
for
cold
winter
nights
by
the
fire
and
light
and
refreshing
for
warmer
weather
lighter
occasions
i
dont
know
how
they
do
it
but
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
for
any
occasion
unbelievable
this
is
a
nice
simply
focused
stout
it
showcases
dry
roasted
grain
flavors
without
getting
too
harsh
too
bitter
burntly
acidic
or
astringent
very
nicely
done
i
could
see
myself
quaffing
a
few
pints
of
this
beer
quite
easily
drinkability
damn
quaffable
a
very
enjoyable
stout
reminds
me
of
old
rasputin
a
bit
glad
i
sat
on
this
one
for
a
while
and
was
able
to
bust
it
out
tonight
final
notes
a
very
wellexecuted
stout
that
doesnt
have
the
unpleasant
burnt
taste
that
some
other
stouts
do
deliciously
balanced
and
satisfying
it
would
pair
well
with
a
variety
of
grilledbarbecued
veggies
and
meats
cheers
a
really
nice
dry
tasty
stout
here
from
snake
river
brewing
its
too
bad
i
cant
snag
some
more
of
these
because
id
definitely
pick
up
a
sixer
d
a
well
crafted
stout
id
have
another
i
do
so
love

shipping
this
result
pours
a
straight
obsidian
topped
by
a
halffinger
or
so
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
rather
roastcentric
with
some
light
coffee
chocolate
lightish
molasses
and
vanilla
bean
rounding
things
out
in
the
nasal
department
the
taste
follows
the
same
basic
plan
with
the
roasted
malts
leading
the
way
followed
by
some
dark
chocolate
powder
molasses
brown
sugar
maple
syrup
and
a
hint
of
toffee
the
body
is
a
nice
solid
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
rather
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
stout
one
that
i
could
easily
see
being
a
staple
if
i
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
rockies
drinkability
was
superb
i
could
house
a
6er
of
these
no
problem
and
the
psychosomatic
effect
of
the
coffee
taste
would
keep
me
going
all
night
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
that
starts
with
a
coffee
kick
and
then
ends
with
a
slight
smoothness
i
hope
to
find
this
beer
again
in
the
future
pours

viscous
pour
with
a
generous
dark
tan

and
tons
of

looks
like
an
imperial

roastiness
as
it
was

finish
body
is
a
bit
thinner
than
what
i
was
expecting
after
the
pour
but
this
is
solid
stuff
a
great
tasty
lower
alcohol
stout
that
has
much
flavor
as
many
imperials
excellent
stout
pitch
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
with
good
retention
coffee
and
chocolate
aromas
were
noticeable
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
along
with
some
hops
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aroma
nothing
to
extreme
just
a
good
delicious
stout
sometimes
less
is
more
this
beer
is
not
overly
complex
but
is
quite
good
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
and
somewhat
dry
worth
seeking
out
if
you
have
a
chance
for
such
a
dark
beer
it
just
looked
clean
in
the
glass
not
cloudy
or
creamy
just
clean
heavy
on
the
malt
flavor
while
you
taste
a
bit
of
the
hops
it
was
mostly
the
malts
comings
through
i
can
only
imagine
what
the
place
smells
like
when
this
stuff
is
cooking
and
i
think
i
would
like
it
while
this
would
not
be
a
regular
drinking
bottle
for
me
i
would
definitely
look
for
this
when
i
want
something
with
good
heavy
flavor
just
to
sit
down
and
sip
down
drinks
solidlyno
boozy
quality
to
this
brewpretty
smooth
d
this
is
probably
the
best
american
stout
ive
had
in
a
very
long
time
im
very
pleased
to
have
tried
it
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
a
friend
its
too
bad
i
dont
have
any
more
at
the
moment
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
pitch
black
and
lets
absolutely
no
light
through
a
fairly
impressive
looking
one
inch
caramel
colored
head
but
fades
away
too
quickly
smells
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
just
a
hint
of
smokeiness
all
those
notes
come
back
in
the
taste
along
with
some
bitter
chocolate
dry
finish
low
carbonation
drinks
very
thin
combined
with
almost
no
trace
of
the
6
abv
good
drinkability
overall
a
very
average
american
stout
would
drink
again
if
offered
but
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
seek
it
out
bottle
into
english
pint
pours
a
velvety
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
fell
fast
except
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
leaving
a
nice
lacing
as
it
went
aroma
is
as
expected
of
the
roast
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
slight
hint
of
smoke
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
little
more
jump
to
the
carbonation
than
i
expected
but
it
helped
to
pull
the
nice
roast
chocolate
flavor
forward
as
well
as
a
bit
of
a
sharp
hop
bite
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
of
a
sharper
finish
with
that
bite
but
the
flavor
just
seemed
to
linger
a
hair
too
long
not
the
best
example
i
have
had
of
the
style
but
far
from
the
worst
d
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
this
almost
sessionable
bottle
of
beer
very
pleasantly
surprised
ill
try
to
get
my
hands
on
this
one
again
soon
overall
a
worthwhile
beer
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
d
this
is
a
very
good
stout
it
has
a
good
taste
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
could
drink
too
many
too
quickly
worth
getting
to
try
sometime
i
think
anybody
who
hates
this
probably
shouldnt
be
drinking
beer
best
regards
w
a
really
enjoyable
beer
for
anyone
who
likes
stouts
or
coffee
for
that
matter
a
definite
recommendation
as
this
brew
is
not
too
sweet
and
yet
the
malts
carry
the
taste
with
such
a
nice
mix
of
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
flavor
drinkability
is
very
high
as
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
or
have
it
with
a
meal
glad
this
arrived
in
the
mail
i
got
this
as
part
of
my
botmc
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
is
jet
black
2
finger
sticky
head
and
lots
of
lacing
it
has
big
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
in
the
aroma
the
taste
follows
teh
nose
the
finish
lingers
with
dark
bitter
sweet
chocolate
it
is
medium
to
full
in
body
this
was
a
pleasant
suprise
this
is
a
beer
to
be
seeked
out
although
i
can
appreciate
a
good
one
ive
never
really
been
much
of
a
stout
guy
i
really
really
liked
this
beer
though
and
would
certainly
be
into
others
that
walked
these
lines
moderately
full
body
very
creamy
this
one
really
delivered
full
of
flavor
without
being
overwhelming
or
intoxicating
reminds
me
of
fbs
without
the
heavy
bitter
roast
or
alcohol
one
destined
for
repeat
performances
drinkability
while
a
nice
drinkable
even
delectable
stout
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
body
roasted
character
or
bitterness
or
maybe
all
three
to
elevate
this
above
simply
very
good
status
still
quite
pleased
overall
taste
a
straight
forward
stout
with
no
surprises
the
usual
coffeechocolate
blend
no
spice
average
hop
presence
not
too
bitter
despite
the
coffee
aspect
of
it
hangs
tough
throughout
worth
picking
up
a
6er
of
it
when
you
can
find
it
which
doesnt
seem
too
often
does
everything
well
a
fresh
pot
of
the
box
botmc
lets
give
it
a
whirl
smells
delicious
of
roasted
malts
and
earthy
hops
with
a
hint
of
coffee
pours
to
an
opaque
jet
black
with
a
dark
tan
head
taste
is
a
very
consistent
roasted
malt
with
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
but
the
bitterness
stays
behind
the
heavy
roasted
malt
finish
is
a
sweet
yet
bitter
staying
consistent
with
taste
throughout
aftertaste
lingers
on
the
tongue
and
roof
of
mouth
leaving
both
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
silk
with
good
carbonation
a
very
good
stout
fresh
tasting
and
flavorful
dthis
is
a
great
year
round
stout
beer
and
i
do
enjoy
it
it
has
a
bit
of
a
hard
time
standing
apart
from
other
stouts
in
my
humble
opinion
d
drinkability
is
well
above
average
with
less
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
with
no
problems
at
all
the
alcohol
is
masked
pretty
well
and
the
combination
of
flavors
really
has
a
nice
balance
that
i
dont
come
across
too
often
its
good
enough
to
make
me
want
to
seek
out
more
of
this
beer
and
other
selections
from
snake
river
highly
recommended
for
any
stout
lover
overall
im
glad
i
picked
this
rando
in
a
makeyourown
6pack
it
looks
great
the
taste
and
smell
are
good
but
the
drinkability
and
price
are
what
will
get
me
to
but
this
one
again
this
ones
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
zonker
compares
very
favorably
to
old
rasputin
drinkability
is
higher
with
a
6
00
abv
and
feel
is
a
little
lower
because
zonker
is
only
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
all
other
attributes
are
similar
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
short
lasting
tan
head
good
coffee
and
chocolate
aroma
taste
following
closely
on
the
heels
of
aroma
i
e
coffee
and
chocolate
i
think
im
just
going
to
have
to
make
that
trek
to
jackson
hole
to
try
one
of
these
babies
on
tap
yummy
great
stout
poured
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
and
good
lace
color
is
opaque
aroma
is
exactly
as
it
should
be
nice
and
roasty
malty
and
a
bit
earthy
ditto
flavor
add
a
little
chocolate
and
roastiness
and
this
is
truly
delicious
great
finish
no
off
flavors
satisfying
body
is
just
fine
with
great
carbonation
good
clean
finish
drinkable
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
american
stouts
out
there
just
left
room
in
my
score
for
something
better
if
it
is
out
there
pours
very
dark
almost
completely
black
with
a
large
mocha
colored
head
that
has
great
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
of
malted
milk
balls
coffee
and
roasted
malts
could
be
more
upfront
with
the
aroma
has
a
great
roasted
malt
flavor
hints
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
some
floral
hops
bitterness
is
moderate
which
comes
from
a
combination
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
just
a
faint
hint
of
alcohol
has
a
rich
thick
body
but
with
just
a
hint
of
overcarbonation
otherwise
this
would
be
perfect
i
am
very
happy
to
see
this
beer
make
it
to
this
market
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to
buy
and
drink
this
again
d
a
very
good
stout
im
glad
to
have
brought
this
one
in
the
best
beer
from
snake
river
i
have
tried
to
this
day
hv
d
this
is
about
as
drinkable
a
stout
as
youre
going
to
find
good
from
the
second
its
poured
til
the
second
youre
pouring
another
appearance
is
good
dark
and
tan
bubbles
with
little
to
no
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
similar
but
the
smell
is
a
bit
bigger
nice
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
there
is
a
bit
of
hops
but
not
much
mouthfeel
is
above
average
medium
in
body
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
pours
a
think
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
foam
that
sticks
around
the
aroma
is
very
intense
graham
cracker
milk
chocolate
cream
and
lot
of
roasted
malt
this
is
everything
i
like
in
the
aroma
of
a
stout
the
taste
is
just
as
intense
and
just
as
thought
provoking
the
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
a
silky
texture
and
appropriately
low
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
a
beer
impressed
me
this
much
it
has
probably
been
years
there
is
really
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
going
on
in
this
beer
it
is
just
a
stout
done
as
well
as
a
stout
can
be
done
and
at
a
abv
that
let
me
enjoy
it
all
night
long
in
closing
i
got
this
through
a
trade
with
johngalt1
who
has
always
been
a
great
trader
i
cant
get
this
local
to
me
in
san
diego
so
i
probably
wont
be
getting
more
any
time
soon
maybe
ill
throw
this
on
my
wants
in
case
i
can
pick
one
up
as
an
extra
hmmm
d
totally
awesome
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
it
quenched
my
thirst
for
a
really
strong
dark
and
delicious
beer
devoid
of
hop
flavor
im
taking
my
sweet
time
with
it
though
its
much
more
of
a
sipper
d
pretty
good
black
color
with
a
cola
like
finish
in
terms
of
bubbly
prickle
the
head
starts
out
thick
and
foamy
but
its
lively
and
breaks
apart
leaving
just
a
rim
of
foam
and
some
light
lacing
some
mild
oatmeal
on
the
nose
and
some
light
roasty
tones
deep
rich
roasted
malt
and
smoke
flavors
throughout
the
flavor
and
body
light
body
and
mouthfeel
for
the
deepnes
of
the
roasted
flavors
and
for
this
style
in
general
a
littl
booze
like
at
the
finish
but
mostly
smoke
i
would
attribute
any
booziness
that
pops
through
to
the
lighter
body
and
not
carrying
it
background
is
pretty
dry
and
the
flavors
pop
pretty
well
full
flavor
presentation
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
drank
this
one
on
its
own
no
food
paired
md
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
a
little
thin
very
good
carboantion
gives
a
more
lively
feel
than
the
typical
creamy
smooth
stout
feel
easy
drinking
d
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
good
thin
is
about
all
i
can
say
bad
about
this
one
i
like
the
roast
the
slight
smoke
with
big
chocolate
notes
its
a
new
state
rating
to
boot
notes
almost
imperial
in
flavour
but
lacking
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
excellent
md
medium
bodied
and
good
tasting
nice
carbonation
id
definitely
be
into
having
this
one
again
overall
a
very
solid
little
stout
and
a
nice
little
afternoon
snack
i
would
have
no
issue
having
this
one
again
or
trying
another
beer
from
snake
river
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
it
is
a
great
stout
poured
this
deep
cola
colored
beer
into
a
pint
glass
to
enjoy
gave
a
good
amount
of
head
when
poured
and
reduced
to
a
good
amount
of
lacing
lingering
on
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
cooking
chocolate
greets
the
nose
and
gives
hints
of
the
spice
the
coffee
grounds
and
sweeter
then
expected
chocolate
taste
overall
this
is
a
great
tasting
stout
that
i
would
recommend
anyone
try
overall
an
excellent
bottled
stout
i
am
very
impressed
pours
a
thick
rich
black
that
verry
little
light
gets
through
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
lite
lacing
around
the
glass
the
taste
is
one
of
bakers
chocalt
coffie
and
burnt
malt
this
bitter
from
start
to
finish
the
last
taste
is
one
of
hops
and
burnt
coffiee
that
leaves
me
asking
for
more
i
got
three
of
these
in
a
trade
i
will
have
to
trade
for
more
this
is
a
top
shelf
stout
for
sure
standard
pint
at
the
brewpub
and
a
bottle
at
mountain
high
pizza
pie
in
jackson
updated
slightly
101309
with
a
sixer
purchased
in
rock
springs
wy
m
d
a
rather
slick
feel
with
a
zip
of
carbonation
in
there
with
a
modest
abv
its
a
nice
and
flavourful
stout
that
would
be
easily
sessionable
for
some
good
stuff
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
will
be
purchasing
many
more
of
these
and
enjoying
them
throughout
the
fall
and
winter
very
drinkable
and
sort
of
between
ris
and
american
stout
get
some
very
clean
heavily
roasted
tastes
upfrontsmokey
woodiness
with
toasty
sweet

execellent
balance
with
a
crisp
sharp
cirtusy
bitterness
with
astrigent
chocolat
overtones
very
smooth
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
making
for
exceptional
drinkability
for
a
stout
very
enjoyable
with
lots
of
complexity
must
try
stout
opinion
i
actually
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
think
that
it
has
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
and
i
like
the
malty
balance
that
is
persistent
the
whole
way
through
the
chocolate
is
showcased
in
this
beer
and
that
is
not
a
bad
thing
they
could
almost
sell
it
as
a
chocolate
beer
either
way
i
think
that
this
is
a
prety
good
beer
and
i
would
certainly
try
it
again
especially
in
alaska
whe
you
are
wearing
a

vest

another

a
long

slightly
full

pretty
nice
and
a
bit
unique
definitely
worth
trying
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
very
nice
low

stout
as
good
as
a
session
stout
as
you
will
find
thanks
to
johngault1
for
this
traded
bottle
poured
a
black
stout
with
slight
lightness
about
itnot
really
viscous
pour
with
that
oily
look
smelled
of
toasted
malt
chocolate
and
maybe
some
darker
fruits
taste
followed
up
the
smell
with
a
roasted
coffee
vanilla
flavor
some
dark
bitter
cocoa
was
there
i
didnt
pick
up
a
lot
of
fruit
but
maybe
a
slight
bit
of
caramel
fairly
full
in
the
mouth
but
crisp
for
a
stout
hops
are
there
but
dont
add
floral
or
citrus
maybe
add
to
an
earthy
feel
on
the
swallow
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
nothing
that
will
blow
you
away
but
this
is
a
well
crafted
well
balanced
beer
that
highlights
classic
stout
flavors
loving
everything
ive
tried
from
these
guys
d
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
id
want
more
than

much
each
time
i
raise
the
glass
but
the
flavor
more
then
makes
up
for
it
snake
river
makes
pretty
good
brews
and
i
would
consider
this
their
bottled
flagship
if
you
ever
make
it
to
jackson
hole
stop
at
the
brewpub
a
little
touristy
but
also
where
the
locals
drink
good
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
that
i
drink
very
frequently
but
havent
had
time
to
review
i
have
it
once
or
twice
a
week
at
lunch
when
i
eat
at
the
coop
not
to
mention
the
times
i
suck
on
one
while
watching
tv
great
beer
and
by
far
the
best
brew
that
snake
river
makes
highly
recommended
zonker
stout
is
one
of
the
better
american
stouts
ive
had
in
awhile
id
like
to
try
more
offerings
from
snake
river
if
theyre
half
as
good
as
zonker
theyd
be
quality
d
pretty
decent
stout
would
liked
to
have
seen
a
bit
more
sweetness
i
have
a
few
more
in
the
fridge
so
ill
drink
those
but
there
are
a
bunch
of
others
i
think
id
go
to
first
poured
into
my
sa
special
glass
best
enjoyed
by
end
of
december
notched
on
label
pours
jet
black
with
a
fantastic
brownish
head
with
1
finger
of
froth
aroma
of
strong
espresso
sweet
molasses
chocolate
cupcakes
head
quickly
dissolves
leaving
little
lacing
in
the
glass
very
roasty
in
the
mouth
as
all
american
stouts
should
be
sweet
body
with
some
pronounced
hop
bitterness
transitioning
nicely
into
a
dry
slightly
hoppy
finish
simply
delicious
this
stout
has
it
all
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
stout
for
quite
some
time
and
now
through
the
gracious
efforts
of
one
pimpp
i
have
an
opportunity
x3
in
fact
to
do
so
best
before
the
end
of
january
2008
i
presume
oily
viscous
pitch
body
with
densely
packed
fat
head
of
dark
tan
foam
sticky
clumps
of
lacing
chocolate
roast
dark
toffee
slight
herbal
hop
aroma
firm
roastiness
wrapped
in
robust
bakers
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
soft
mineral
twang
and
leafymusty
hops
accent
the
lingering
charinflected
finish
silky
smooth
body
gorgeous
in
its
balance
of
substance
and
unobtrusiveness
incredibly
drinkable
reminds
me
of
why
i
love
stouts
so
much
i
wish
they
all
could
be
as
fantastic
as
this
one
overall
delicious
definitely
1
of
my
favorite
stouts
now
amazing
drinkablility
almost
a
session
stout
for
sure
i
wish
i
could
get
more
of
this
stuff
d
an
awesome
stout
d
went
down
very
easily
it
would
make
a
pretty
good
session
beer
if
youre
a
stout
chocolate
andor
coffee
lover
very
nice
stout
and
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
pours
black
and
viscous
from
the
bottle
very
intense
looking
liquid
but
unfortunately
with
no
real
head
or
lacing
what
head
there
is
is
quite
dark
aromas
of
coffee
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
and
a
bit
of
licorice
ropund
out
the
smell
the
taste
is
quite
robust
but
also
quite
smooth
with
flavors
of
vanilla
coffee
coconut
and
syrup
drenched
bacon
complex
and
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
and
medium
bodied
i
really
enjoyed
this
it
is
not
quite
world
class
but
very
very
solid
and
packs
a
lot
of
punch
for
the
reasonable
abv
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
the
versatile
type
of
stout
that
you
can
either
pound
down
for
an
evening
or
sip
slowly
as
you
just
relax
and
watch
tv
another
great
american
craft
beer
disappointing
that
this
one
is
just
generally
available
locally
thanks
be
to
ba
and
the
trade
network
as
this
one
should
be
on
your
try
list

if
youre
a
stout
person
poured
into
a
regular
glass
from
a
bottle
notched
best
by
march
drank
on
april
5th
poured
a
very
dark
opaque
black
with
a
nice
thick
foamy
brown
head
head
lasted
the
whole
glass
with
lacings
towards
the
end
aroma
was
slightly
sweet
but
had
a
definate
burnt
malty
oatmealy
to
it
tasted
of
sweet
chocolate
oats
very
easy
to
drink
no
bitterness
or
excess
carbonation
very
solid
beer
i
kept
this
in
the
fridge
too
long
it
would
likely
be
even
better
if
it
were
warmed
but
this
is
up
there
with
brooklyn
chocolate
and
flying
dog
gonzo
and
even
my
fave
porters
great
stuff
get
it
and
and
get
it
again
as
i
will
d
the
only
thing
holding
one
back
from
knocking
down
a
sixer
is
the
full
body
of
this
brew
surprisingly
tasty
with
varied
flavors
throughout
recommend
near
solid
black
body
with
a
frothy
mocha
head
roasted
coffee
aroma
and
the
same
goes
for
the
taste
aftertaste
of
coffee
flavors
lingers
on
the
tongue
with
some
hop
bitterness
right
before
good
carbonation
not
a
heavily
bodied
beer
a
very
nicely
balanced
stout
that
is
extremely
drinkable
one
of
the
better
stouts
that
i
have
had
in
awhile
that
didnt
have
imperial
or
russian
in
the
name
overall
impression
very
nice
good
variety
of
flavors
highly
drinkable
this
one
is
a
winner
thanks
to
wasatch
for
sending
this
bottle
a
good
brew
overall
a
very
dark
brownblack
beer
completely
opaque
no
light
gets
thru
has
a
big
foamy
brown
head
and
good
lace
the
aroma
has
a
strong
coffee
character
with
some
chocolate
notes
and
a
hint
of
piney
hops
in
the
background
a
big
roasted
malt
character
covers
your
tongue
with
a
lot
of
bittersweet
chocolate
twang
the
finish
has
some
coffee
bitterness
mixed
with
a
hint
of
piney
hops
for
a
nice
dry
finish
an
inviting
and
appeasing
brew
thanks
wasatch
for
this
very
good
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
somewhat
chewy
good
stuff
overall
doesnt
ever
get
to
be
too
heavy
on
the
palate
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
tad
dry
on
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
soild
stout
that
i
would
easily
grab
if
it
was
more
readily
available
makes
me
want
to
try
more
snake
river
brews
thanks
kmpitz2
d
love
me
a
fine
stout
and
this
is
one
of
them
nice
balance
of
this
beer
rich
and
full
bodied
make
this
a
fine
winter
offering
im
sure
many
a
skier
has
enjoyed
this
after
a
hard
day
on
the
slopes
poured
silky
smooth
with
a
thick
reddish
head
that
has
small
and
larger
bubbles
intermixed
the
aroma
of
coffe
and
chocolate
are
strong
smooth
and
tangy
this
one
is
as
the
bubbles
dance
on
your
tongue
leaving
a
roasted
barley
aftertaste
or
burnt
however
you
describe
it
mouthfeel
is
not
as
rich
as
you
would
normally
see
from
this
style
of
beer
and
very
carbonated
a
decent
example
of
the
stout
style
does
have
more
hop
flavor
than
i
would
expect
from
this
style
d
a
wonderful
stout
that
i
could
drink
all
night
long
d
enjoyable
beer
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
very
very
nice
flavor
though
this
would
be
a
good
contestant
for
some
barrel
aging
overall
its
a
very
mediumaverage
americanrobust
stout
i
wouldnt
complain
if
someone
else
was
buying
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
creamy
smooth
mediumfull
bodied
think
melted
chocolate
ice
cream
consistency
quite
perfect
incredibly
drinkable
also
i
am
officially
going
back
to
get
the
rest
of
the
6er
finally
got
around
to
this
brew
pours
a
black
color
some
carbonation
tiny
head
not
much
lacing
afterwards
scents
of
malts
toffee
caramel
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
very
toffeecaramel
like
a
little
sweet
as
well
medium
body
very
drinkable
a
pretty
tasty
stout
in
my
book
pretty
thick
as
well
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
some
do
it
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
smooth
sweet
sugary
roasty
chewy
and
dry
there
is
a
mild
thin
feel
about
halfway
through
the
swallow
but
overall
its
just
a
minor
glitch
in
the
grand
scheme
of
this
brew
good
stuff
enjoy
it
if
you
can
please
my
thanks
goes
out
to
bitterbill
for
including
two
of
these
in
our
trade
pours
an
absolute
perfect
thick
oil
black
with
a
massive
one
inch
thick
chocolate
brown
head
nose
is
very
enviting
with
zesty
smokey
malt
and
tones
of
chocolate
nicely
aromatic
enters
the
mouth
and
coats
the
tongue
with
silky
black
maltyness
slightly
soured
bitter
twords
the
end
of
the
palate
lacks
the
richness
that
i
would
have
expected
from
a
stout
this
dark
but
not
bad
hints
of
sweetness
do
exist
thes
is
really
decent
for
a
low
doe
stout
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
surprise
considering
the
price
fineshes
to
a
belly
warming
crisp
dark
bitter
12
oz
stubbie
pours
a
nice
solid
black
color
with
a
finger
of
dark
tan
head
that
falls
quickly
to
a
nice
coating
over
top
of
the
brew
this
is
a
nice
dark
beer
and
clarity
is
not
discernable
a
few
stray
bubbles
climb
the
side
of
the
glass
but
otherwise
this
one
is
not
showing
off
any
carbonation
this
brew
smells
really
damn
good
it
has
a
big
blast
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
lighter
notes
of
fig
and
a
very
solid
creamy
character
as
well
i
think
this
one
smells
fantastic
flavor
is
solid
while
not
being
overpowering
the
initial
sip
is
mild
coffee
with
sweet
chocolate
back
notes
it
moves
to
a
mild
pine
hop
that
accentuates
the
coffee
notes
it
finishes
with
a
moderate
bitterness
and
the
chocolate
and
coffee
fade
to
a
moderate
chocolate
coated
fig
as
it
warms
i
get
very
nice
creamy
notes
that
lead
me
to
believe
there
is
some
oat
in
this
beer
i
like
the
transitions
in
this
brew
nothing
is
too
strong
and
balance
is
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
to
thick
with
a
very
solid
creamyness
and
very
light
carbonation
the
carbonation
makes
this
one
come
across
more
thick
than
it
really
is
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
in
harmony
with
each
other
the
flavors
transition
well
and
play
well
with
each
other
nothing
gets
in
the
way
in
the
beer
and
the
lower
abv
makes
this
one
something
to
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
night
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
that
i
have
for
sure
a
very
good
drinking
stout
with
a
very
robust
flavor
i
agree
with
most
that
this
is
a
good
stout
but
i
find
that
this
is
to
my
senses
nearly
a
coffee
stout
emphasizing
the
roasted
and
smoky
flavors
the
most
a
big
thank
you
to
brent56
for
letting
me
try
this
one
at
the
carolina
brewmasters
bbq
although
way
too
hot
to
be
drinking
too
many
stouts
this
one
really
was
nice
for
the
style
very
deep
and
dark
color
and
bit
more
carbonation
than
expected
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
and
proabably
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
given
the
right
setting
i
will
keep
my
eye
out
for
this
one
again
thanks
thomashardy
for
the
opportunity
and
to
douglas88
for
the
chance
to
revisit
full
roasty
aroma
has
strong
coffee
and
and
chocolate
notes
deep
black
body
with
a
long
lasting
two
finger
thick
mocha
head
its
a
looker
fore
is
almost
salty
and
quite
bitter
with
roasted
notes
chocolate
is
not
present
but
stiff
coffee
is
abundant
the
bitterness
is
big
but
being
from
the
roast
it
incorporates
well
into
the
beer
and
gives
it
a
wetness
you
dont
get
with
predominately
hop
bitterness
it
could
have
more
range
and
some
underlying
dark
fruit
accents
but
it
works
well
as
it
is
i
need
to
get
back
to
that
store
try
the
vienna
amber
from
snake
river
i
saw
there
drinkability
is
excellent
really
excellent
example
of
a
fullbodied
and
flavored
stout
which
can
stand
the
round
about
trip
to
mi
drinkablilty
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
not
as
good
as
storm
king
but
what
is
overall
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
regret
only
buying
one
bottle
drinkabilitys
is
good
an
enjoyable
easy
drinking
stout
great
for
everyday
drinking
thanks
go
to
mentor
for
this
extra
treat
he
threw
in
drinkability
quite
drinkable
the
taste
is
pretty
complex
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
up
front
and
in
the
middle
and
a
note
of
bitterness
at
the
end
a
very
well
made
stout
that
is
sure
to
satisfy
im
very
glad
this
is
available
locally
has
a
medium
body
and
carbonation
levels
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
really
enjoyable
i
think
i
might
have
found
a
replacement
for
8
ball
and
sierra
nevada
stout
drinkability
this
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
it
was
for
me
on
my
last
brew
session
pours
a
very
opaque
black
some
brown
highlights
a
medium
tan
head
and
lots
of
lace
smell
is
sweet
with
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
a
sweet
smokiness
taste
is
bizaare
as
its
watery
and
tasteless
until
the
end
of
the
sip
when
youre
hit
with
a
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
and
silky
smooth
quite
complex
for
a
beer
of
session
strength
absolutely
delicious
this
is
a
gem
of
a
beer
now
to
figure
out
how
to
get
more
a
dark
brown
head
a
half
inch
thick
composed
of
fine
bubbles
topped
this
black
beer
that
had
faint
chocolate
highlights
decent
head
retention
too
and
some
lacing
to
boot
the
aroma
was
creamy
with
a
light
roast
coffee
character
and
milk
chocolate
the
flavour
started
out
quite
weak
and
watery
but
sweetness
soon
followed
things
picked
up
at
the
midpoint
with
chocolate
and
hop
flavours
accompanying
a
moderate
bitterness
a
thick
lactose
sweetness
also
showed
up
at
this
point
it
finished
roasty
and
offdry
with
some
lingering
acidity
silky
viscous
body
and
low
carbonation
with
a
bit
of
slickness
overall
it
had
a
good
flavour
once
it
kicked
in
but
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
less
as
i
proceeded
through
the
bottle
thanks
viggo
bottle
provided
by
mattcrill
ala
bif16
actually
that
bottle
arrived
empty
but
then
i
saw
the
same
beer
at
liquor
mart
boulder
a
couple
days
later
i
never
would
have
tried
it
otherwise
thanks
for
the
suggestion
the
freshness
notch
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
is
oct
pours
a
half
finger
browntan
head
over
a
black
liquid
poured
thicker
than
i
expected
from
a
stout
more
like
a
very
dark
bwine
smells
tamed
coffee
roast
but
sweetened
and
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
its
got
a
lactose
smell
to
it
which
is
a
scent
i
often
get
in
oatmeal
stouts
too
overall
the
smell
is
subdued
and
simple
tastes
of
coffee
muted
with
a
milk
and
caramel
sweet
i
cant
tell
if
the
roast
is
gentle
or
if
the
other
characteristics
steal
away
the
bitter
punch
of
the
roast
its
got
a
little
bit
of
an
alcohol
sting
and
some
grassy
hop
character
which
is
coming
across
to
me
as
williamette
the
sweet
runs
out
in
the
finish
leaving
the
beer
dry
and
with
the
feel
of
roasty
bit
on
the
tongue
wow
im
really
impressed
by
this
simple
little
stout
from
a
small
brewery
in
the
state
to
the
north
mouthfeel
is
mdthick
and
although
the
carbonation
is
fine
its
a
bit
sharper
and
more
than
i
would
expect
as
the
beer
warms
a
sour
from
black
patent
appears
but
this
is
new
challenge
of
angst
is
countered
by
a
thick
chocolate
that
has
also
risen
well
done
this
was
a
really
nice
offering
drinkability
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
smoke
but
it
worked
fairly
well
with
this
beer
lots
of
flavor
in
this
one
for
sure
drinkability
a
great
stout
for
sure
nice
and
roasty
and
can
easily
do
a
session
with
the
lower
abv
not
sure
i
would
agree
with
outstanding
but
i
would
highly
recommend
it
a
classic
example
of
an
american
stout
overall
this
is
a
really
good
stout
and
one
that
i
would
have
absolutely
no
problem
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
id
just
make
a
point
to
let
it
sit
for
a
few
minutes
before
i
started
i
hope
this
was
just
an
odd
bad
bottle
drinkability
well
here
im
in
a
bit
of
a
quandary
not
everyone
can
suck
down
stouts
like
i
can
and
this
beer
is
only
distributed
as
far
as
montana
as
far
as
i
know
that
said
i
have
downed
so
many
cases
of
this
spectacular
beer
that
im
going
to
rate
it
at
a
solid
4
5
any
stout
that
clocks
in
at
a
mere
5
8
and
tastes
like
a
stout
rather
than
an
illnamed
brown
freaking
ale
needs
to
be
supped
as
much
as
possible
sadly
i
only
have
one
bottle
left
squirreled
away
in
my
basement
ok
its
not
in
my
basement
yet
but
its
in
my
kitchen
which
is
by
my
basement
sort
of
im
working
on
it
it
was
on
the
verge
of
being
thick
and
black
when
poured
with
a
little
bit
of
tan
foam
and
little
lace
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
dominated
this
brew
the
sweettart
taste
of
roasted
malts
was
well
balanced
a
nice
stout
this
beer
is
very
dark
brown
black
out
of
the
bottle
with
brown
edges
it
sports
1cm
of
still
thick
brown
head
swoops
and
small
spots
of
lacing
strong
aroma
of
toffee
and
cocoa
acres

a

feel
with
a

this
truly

but
still
very
enjoyable
12
ounce

pours
out
thick
and
black
with
little
head
even
with
a
hard
pour
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
aroma
big
roasted
flavor
high
acidity
bitter
chocolate
this
is
a
very
flavorful
stout
more
hops
than
usual
for
this
style
of
beer
pretty
drinkable
for
the
style
while
i
enjoyed
everything
about
this
beer
nothing
really
blew
me
away
still
this
is
definitely
a
stout
worth
looking
into
this
brewery
known
for
this
product
alone
i
found
it
a
competent
stout
compared
to
what
i
had
before
in
the
style
and
just
a
better
than
average
brew
syrupy
some
sourness
not
watery
but
not
a
full
mouthfeel
either
picked
up
at
linas
this
week
near
cleveland
expiry
date
march
now
if
this
is
the
past
march
because
they
seems
to
have
a
fresh
stock
of
beers
from
everything
else
i
have
seen
it
shouldnt
be
significant
very
dark
brown
coffee
with
a
tight
cocoabrown
head
that
lasts
sweet
milk
chocolate
molasses
rum
roasted
coffee
and
some
earthy
bitterness
make
up
the
nose
yum
taste
starts
with
dark
fruit
and
chocolatey
sweetness
roasted
barley
comes
on
strong
leading
to
a
coffee
bitter
wellhopped
finish
lingering
roasty
sweetness
a
great
stout
right
up
there
with
shakespeare
big
bodied
full
creamy
mouthfeel
delicious
a
beer
full
of
flavor
the
last
sip
leaves
you
wanting
another
simply
outstanding
this
is
really
good
i
recommend
it
pours
black
with
a
thick
brown
head
cocoa
roasted
grain
and
chocolate
malt
in
the
nose
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
bland
front
opens
up
to
a
bittersweet
middle
of
roasted
malt
and
barley
but
a
hop
bitterness
dominates
the
finish
unfortunately
the
flavor
turns
sour
overly
carbonated
right
out
of
the
bottle
it
softened
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
to
room
temperature
this
is
not
a
great
stout
drinkable
but
not
worth
purchasing
again
brought
back
directly
from
the
jackson
hole
it
poured
out
like
motor
oil
the
head
was
suprisingly
darker
than
i
have
noticed
from
other
stouts
it
was
almost
a
deep
brown
the
smell
was
somewhat
pleasing
with
caramel
buttery
choclate
aroma
the
taste
was
nice
upfront
but
the
finish
was
a
little
out
of
balance
the
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
nut
were
a
little
too
sharp
for
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
a
little
to
heavy
for
an
all
nighter
good
stout
overall
but
a
little
overrated
in
my
mind
imposing
black
hue
it
poured
from
the
bottle
very
heavy
ive
seen
thinner
imperial
stouts
no
light
could
penetrate
the
liquid
impressive
the
head
was
russet
in
color
and
about
one
finger
in
height
head
retention
was
very
good
it
slowly
faded
to
a
soapy
cap
that
lasted
the
entire
consumption
subsequent
lacing
was
unorganized
and
patchy
its
a
great
looking
stout
the
nose
is
inviting
big
bold
blast
of
roast
that
encompasses
coffee
hints
of
cocoa
beans
char
oat
and
sugary
sweetness
at
the
distant
back
is
a
hint
of
earthiness
formidable
potency
it
is
loud
enough
i
find
the
bouquet
on
this
stout
to
be
ideal
for
the
style
i
love
it
mouthwatering
good
inviting
close
to
perfection
the
palate
is
not
a
let
down
my
word
this
brewery
is
topnotch
it
makes
me
want
to
move
to
wyoming
okay
not
quite
anyway
the
palate
is
simply
lovely
roasted
malts
are
dry
for
a
while
cocoa
beans
in
the
middle
a
flash
of
hops
materialize
and
offer
some
bitterness
to
counterpunch
the
astringency
there
is
just
a
hint
of
citrus
juiciness
this
plays
very
well
with
caramel
hints
and
oatlike
sweetness
the
finish
is
coffee
and
char
simply
lovely
stuff
this
stout
really
impresses
me
it
is
a
great
american
stoutdry
stout
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
great
mediummediumfull
in
body
with
ticklish
carbonation
that
produces
a
mouthfeel
that
is
pleasant
it
is
just
big
enough
and
yet
have
finesse
extremely
drinkable
there
is
no
flaws
no
complaints
it
is
a
terrific
stout
give
me
a
steak
i
really
wish
snake
river
beer
were
sold
in
nebraska
because
id
buy
their
beer
regularly
i
purchased
a
12ounce
bottle
in
brookfield
wi
the
next
time
i
see
this
beer
i
am
going
to
buying
more

very
nice
almost

perfect
im
a
believer
in
the
things
i
heard
of
this
stout
all
expectations
of
this
rare
brew
have
been
met
thank
you
for
being
available
in
cleveland
an
opaque
stout
that
pours
with
a
nice
bit
of
foam
the
intense
chocolate
aroma
is
awesome
starts
smooth
almost
milk
chocolately
and
get
dry
towards
the
finihs
which
is
laced
with
hop
bitterness
the
taste
of
chocolate
lingers
on
the
palate
i
like
how
the
hops
are
balanced
with
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
flavors
i
also
really
like
the
dry
finish
could
a
little
roasted
coffee
flavor
wold
be
nice
otherwise
an
excellent
stout
and
one
im
definitely
going
to
have
again
unfortunately
this
was
my
only
bottle
picked
up
in
wisconsin
at
the
brennans
market
in
brookfield
solid
pourdeep
and
dark
with
a
fat
creamy
and
sticky
cocoa
brown
head
aromas
hint
of
espresso
crunch
candy
the
mouthfeel
here
is
unctuous
while
still
balanced
with
plenty
of
elegant
zip
this
is
quite
the
flavor
driven
beverage
features
include
espresso
cream
roasted
and
nicely
bitter
coffee
bean
bitttersweet
chocolate
and
a
trace
of
vanillan
this
is
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
and
as
i
do
i
only
want
moremost
certainly
recommended
from
the
bottle
pours
a
black
liquid
with
no
highlights
nice
thick
tan
head
that
stayed
for
a
long
time
nice
lace
on
the
glass
at
the
end
smell
is
slightly
chocolate
but
not
much
else
going
on
taste
again
was
slightly
chocolate
along
with
a
malt
that
was
so
roasty
it
almost
seemed
burnt
not
that
this
is
a
bad
thing
lots
of
hopr
bitterness
in
this
one
this
is
a
wellhopped
stout
for
sure
dry
finish
fullbodied
with
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
exactly
what
the
mouthfeel
of
a
stout
should
be
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
very
well
hopped
but
not
overwhleming
the
deep
roasted
malt
character
i
will
certainly
look
for
this
one
again
in
the
future
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
i
think
could
be
used
to
define
a
stout
my
i
cannot
say
enough
about
this
beer
except
i
think
i
will
walk
into
the
garage
and
get
another
out
of
the
fridge
zonker
stout
hits
all
the
right
notes
its
solid
in
all
respects
and
is
my
new
favorite
stout
too
bad
it
isnt
available
in
this
state
because
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all

with

some

and
a

citrus
quite
complex
yet
very
well
balanced
finishes
dry
and
slightly
on
the
bitter
side
with
a
smoked
coffee
aftertaste
this
is
everything
a
fine
stout
should
be

the
beer
pours
motor

black
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
the
dark
brown
head
is
very
small
and
does
not
last
long
at
all
the
aroma
is
chocolate
coffee
and
some
sweetness
the
flavor
is
coffee
slight
chocolate
and
roasted

the
body
is
medium
the
finish
is
dry
coffee
the
nose
is
light
and
gives
off
coffee
and
roasted
malt
sense
the
taste
is
mostly
coffeelike
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
nuts
the
drinkability
here
is
quite
nice
as
the
abv
is
low
for
the
style
overall
a
very
nice
beer
with
less
head
and
lace
than
expected
a
very
rich
and
assertive
stout
nice
balancing
nice
everything
i
first
tried
this
beer
while
doing
field
work
in
wyoming
and
made
sure
to
bring
a
few
back
with
me
to
chicago
wish
i
had
brought
more
pours
a
nice
thick
blackeven
when
held
up
to
a
light
none
passes
through
a
thinish
redbrown
foamy
head
diminishes
fairly
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
of
light
brown
bubbles
wonderful
smell
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
full
bodied
smooth
and
very
tasty
lovely
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
taste
filling
but
highly
drinkable
an
outstanding
beer
and
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
this
to
me
is
easily
a
solid
4
0
beer
it
was
a
very
nice
black
color
which
had
me
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
super
heavy
and
chewy
well
it
was
heavy
but
not
as
i
expected
actually
it
was
quite
light
at
the
same
time
i
was
a
crisp
iced
coffee
like
taste
with
small
hints
of
chocolate
malts
the
head
was
a
nice
thick
one
brownishred
color
head
that
lasted
a
little
bit
and
then
flattened
out
to
a
laceing
the
smell
was
similar
to
the
taste
but
had
more
likeness
to
an
imperial
which
is
a
great
thing
all
in
all
i
liked
this
one
its
a
heavier
brew
but
is
easliy
a
refreshing
one
as
well
poured
a
uh
black
no
black
crude
oil
color
just
the
slightest
amount
of
ruby
red
is
able
to
penetrate
the
edges
of
this
inky
brew
silky
smooth
layer
of
tancolored
head
persists
and
clings
nicely
to
the
sides
of
the

aromas
are
wonderful

roasted
coffee
beans
caramel
flavor
follows
nicely
bitter
chocolate
fresh
coffee
roasted
malts
finishes
with
a
slightly
acidiccoffee
flavor
dry
too
definitely
got
better
as
it
warmed
quite
tasty
and
a
bonus
for
me
in
that
its
available
here
in
richmond
flavor
it
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
an
almost
oily
texture
the
finish
is
dry
this
is
a
straight
ahead
dry
stout
its
very
nicely
done

with
a
fat
creamy

colored
head
with
a
very
nice

is
roasted
chocolaty

and
fresh
brewed
coffee
fairly
full
in
body
and
smooth
and
creamy
in
texture
taste
is
dominated
by
flavors
of
bittersweet
chocolate
with
some
additional
notes
of
espresso
and
smoky
charcoal
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
and
is
a
beer
that
i
would
always
keep
on
hand
if
it
were
available
here
purchased
from
vintage
cellar
the
beer
camed
with
a
deep
deep
black
body
and
a
thick
dark
caramel
head
that
lingered
the
beer
sports
a
strong
roasted
malt
aroma
with
plenty
of
mocha
turns
and
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
burnt
smell
tastewise
this
was
a
wonderful
stout
a
bit
of
initial
bite
plenty
of
sweet
maltiness
rolling
over
your
tongue
fading
to
coffee
and
roasted
malt
aftertaste
a
wellbalanced
smooth
rolling
mouth
feel
a
very
drinkable
stout
easy
one
of
my
top
five
i
highly
recommend
it
tasted
042503
pours
black
as
night
with
only
the
slightest
bit
of
light
creeping
around
the
edges
and
a
nice
creamy
brown
head
that
slowly
sinks
and
leaves
minimal
lace
huge
roasted
malt
nose
with
big
coffee
characteristics
and
an
nice
burnt
background
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
on
the
tongue
with
a
starter
of
slightly
sweet
malt
that
soon
turns
bitter
with
a
big
roasted
malt
bite
that
is
somewhat
like
a
nice
dark
roast
coffee
the
roasted
flavors
fade
towards
the
finish
as
a
nice
burnt
flavor
comes
in
and
lingers
slightly
just
to
remind
you
what
that
last
taste
was
like
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
gets
better
and
better
the
longer
it
sits
as
it
becomes
a
bit
smoother
and
seems
to
almost
thicken
into
a
medium
heavy
body
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
would
be
great
on
draught
and
is
sure
to
see
some
more
time
in
my
fridge
this
beer
is
quite
wellbalanced
between
the
malt
and
hops
its
an
easy
drinker
for
the
whole
six
pack
a
difficult
statement
for
a
stout
as
my
mouth
can
become
anesthetized
sp
after
a
few
dark
ones
this
beer
makes
quite
the
statement
however
pours
like
a
glass
o
road
tar
in
other
words
its
very
dark
thin
and
quickly
diminishing
head
satisfying
coffeeroasted
barley
aroma
and
a
nice
hopsmalt
balance
made
for
good
drinking
glad
i
got
a
sixer
of
this
unfortunately
my
dad
cleaned
me
out
when
he
was
visiting
from
ca
and
sealing
our
driveway
this
solid
stout
exhibits
a
sweet
roasted
aroma
and
nice
deep
color
the
smoky
roasted
malt
flavor
is
supported
by
the
heavy
body
there
is
a
nice
light
bitter
brush
in
the
finish
rounding
off
a
sound
representation
of
the
style
this
beer
poured
an
amazing
jet
black
color
and
formed
a
very
nice
dark
brown
bubbly
head
that
left
some
nice
lace
i
had
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
and
coffee
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
coffee
the
finish
was
a
touch
bitter
and
had
elements
of
the
coffee
a
very
nice
stout
some
good
java
tones
on
the
palate
and
more
of
a
bittersweet
dark
cocoa
rather
than
the
milk
chocolate
on
the
buds
a
little
syruppy
and
if
i
had
one
compaint
that
would
be
it
it
finishes
on
a
nice
dry
note
very
good
stout
not
many
look
better
than
this
one
and
the
rest
is
pretty
good
too
thanks
to
cokes
for
the
sample
notes
a
kickass
robust
style
stout
that
would
make
any
brewery
proud
to
be
the
creators
of
such
a
fine
beverage
it
has
over
16
awards
for
proof
if
my
word
is
not
enough
while
intense
in
all
aspects
this
beer
delivers
what
a
top
notch
stout
should
certainly
a
treat
for
stout
lovers
da
un
beso
ala
botella
is
another
fantastic
stout
from
cigar
city
i
would
have
appreciated
a
little
more
body
but
this
is
still
far
and
away
the
best
export
stout
that
ive
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
consuming
ebf
sample
pours
black
or
something
close
thick
and
viscous
aroma
is
rich
and
very
sweet
i
detected
barrel
aromatics
and
was
impressed
to
find
that
this
was
in
a
rum
barrel
rum
barrels
are
bei
used
more
and
more
and
they
definitely
give
off
some
pretty
interesting
and
less
coercive
flavors
and
aromas
than
bourbon
barrels
in
my
opinion
its
not
necessarily
better
but
its
different
the
nose
is
sweet
chocolate
fudge
spicy
wood
and
dark
fruits
the
flavor
is
quick
sweet
and
decadent
sweet
chocolate
syrup
rum
and
wood
flat
cola
and
some
dark
fruit
finishes
with
spicy
rum
flavor
full
slick
texture
quite
good
would
have
liked
more
of
this
to
better
diagnose
all
the
flavors
tried
this
at
the
extreme
beer
fest
could
of
been
the
other
49
beers
i
sampled
but
i
did
not
care
for
this
one
hunahpus
day
2015
one
of
the
highlights
big
molasses
and
woody
rum
notes
on
the
nose
hints
of
treacle
and
cacao
as
well
as
bits
of
ethanol
and
dark
fruit
chocolate
caramel
and
molasses
with
a
hint
of
burnt
sugar
bitterness
light
oak
with
a
sweet
sugary
rum
note
and
a
touch
of
ethanol
creamy
oily
sticky
mouthfeel
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
big
sweet
and
a
hint
boozy
but
makes
a
really
nice
sipper
on
this
frigid
night
overall
i
dont
dig
the
rum
the
middle
retains
some
very
nice
stout
flavors
but
the
rum
really
doesnt
contribute
well
you
better
like
rum
if
youre
going
to
put
this
near
your
mouth
because
the
beer
is
leading
with
its
sugarcane
shoulder
pads
i
like
rum
if
you
like
rum
drink
this
beer
because
your
palate
will
thank
you
excellent
brew
overall
really
good
although
this
is
described
as
an
export
stout
its
actually
a
better
cigar
city
imperial
stout
than
el
cid
the
look
is
not
quite
as
thick
as
the
marshal
or
huna
but
its
blacker
and
nastier
than
the
vast
majority
of
the
imperial
stouts
out
there
while
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
certainly
top
notch
a
slightly
thicker
feel
would
put
this
over
the
top
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
love
to
see
it
again
cheers
7clutch
thinner
than
expected
given
ccbs
stouts
are
always
super
thick
but
its
still
a
thick
beer
smell
and
taste
are
of
sweet
chocolate
and
rummy
oak
great
dessert
beer
would
enjoy
to
try
one
with
a
good
amount
of
age
tropical
notes
were
fantastic
the
barrel
note
was
decent
and
added
to
the
experience
but
im
curious
to
see
what
it
will
be
like
in
time
im
curious
to
see
if
the
rum
will
step
back
a
small
bit
and
if
the
tropical
notes
can
hold
on
a
take
more
of
the
leading
role
bottle
from
my
membership
have
no
idea
what
to
expect
here
ccb
seems
big
on
the
rum
barrels
for
catador
poured
to
my
el
catador
club
teku
naturally
pitch
black
pour
with
an
espresso
brown
head
looking
creamy
as
can
be
and
the
retention
is
solid
aroma
of
chocolate
covered
licorice
molasses
light
booze
hint
of
vanilla
not
a
lot
of
rum
here
on
the
nose
but
very
nice
very
unique
and
super
creamy
smell
here
the
flavor
is
huge
chocolate
sauce
lots
of
anise
dark
fruits
definite
rum
spice
here
but
not
a
lot
of
booze
some
vanilla
notes
and
a
strong
roasted
malt
presence
that
makes
it
seem
like
there
is
espresso
in
this
thing
rich
silky
mouthfeel
lowish
carbonation
but
not
the
intensely
thick
level
that
often
comes
from
ccb
in
this
case
thats
probably
a
good
thing
as
this
is
so
sweet
and
rich
as
it
is
easily
the
best
rum
infusion
ive
had
in
a
stout
really
nice
but
gonna
be
tough
to
get
through
this
on
my
own
due
to
the
dessert
in
a
glass
qualities
rich
malty
and
roast
goodness
dangerously
drinkable
in
my
opinion
i
get
more
coffee
than
chocolate
on
this
beer
but
the
chocolate
vanilla
cask
version
was
quite
nice
as
well
on
draft
at
gainesville
house
of
beer
pours
jet
black
with
creamy
mocha
head
very
creamy
mouthfeel
wow
this
is
beautiful
sweet
sugary
chocolatelactose
on
the
aroma
this
is
so
creamy
it
feels
and
tastes
like
im
drinking
super
rich
chocolate
milk
with
just
a
a
bit
of
coffee
bitter
to
balance
pretty
sweet
but
very
solid
and
lots
of
flavor
that
bursts
on
the
palate
really
wish
i
would
have
had
a
chance
to
try
check
it
and
see
overall
it
was
a
nice
medium
bodied
dry
roasted
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
i
probably
would
if
there
wasnt
anything
on
tap
that
i
havent
had
before
had
th
is
at
the
taste
of
west
shore
event
in
tampa
best
part
was
that
is
was
free
o
pretty
good
beer
i
liked
it
enough
to
bring
a
growler
back
to
share
dont
drink
a
ton
of
these
style
of
beer
but
its
a
nice
experience
to
have
every
once
in
a
while
went
great
with
an
awesome
gethsemani
bros
fruitcake
overall
enjoyable
sipper
o
another
solid
brew
from
ccb
im
a
fan
of
this
style
to
begin
with
so
i
have
no
complaints
about
this
beer
at
all
great
balance
enjoyable
and
a
glass
or
two
wont
destroy
you
d
good
stuff
an
enjoyable
take
on
a
style
that
doesnt
get
a
ton
of
attention
in
the
us
id
gladly
order
this
if
it
were
ontap
in
florida
and
i
enjoyed
it
significantly
more
than
puppys
breath
porter
othis
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
though
ccb
does
brew
better
stouts
still
i
enjoyed
this
one
from
top
to
bottom
smells
rich
and
malty
nce
bitter
roast
on
the
nose
and
the
tongue
a
touch
thinner
than
id
like
but
very
nice
roast
profile
this
one
is
veery
tasty
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
and
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
weak
but
overall
a
solid
beer
and
a
great
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
mocha
three
finger
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
crazy
head
retention
aroma
of
strong
roasted
malts
coffee
bitterness
from
the
hops
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
licorice
in
the
back
taste
follows
the
nose
just
intensified
slightly
dry
but
not
dry
stout
level
moderate
mouthfeel
this
is
a
great
middle
of
the
road
stout
overall
great
beer
but
i
feel
this
is
another
soured
beer
from
cigar
city
shame
o
to
be
honest
one
could
take
my
review
as
a
little
bias
because
cigar
city
is
by
far
my
favorite
brewery
they
consistently
deliver
choices
within
styles
to
meet
anyones
taste
buds
this
is
a
perfect
desert
beer
i
would
compare
it
to
rogues
chocolate
stout
which
is
one
of
the
worlds
best
but
i
can
enjoy
hot
blooded
to
the
fullest
extent
because
it
is
lighter
more
like
a
bit
size
candy
bar
compared
to
a
whole
birthday
cake
love
the
beer
love
the
brewery
i
had
this
at
the
kickbacks
cigar
cityst
somewhere
dinner
im
reviewing
this
by
memory
on
this
i
had
this
at
the
kickbacks
cigar
cityst
somewhere
dinner
i
have
had
most
of
ccs
regular
beers
but
i
have
not
tried
this
yet
nice
stout
i
liek
this
better
than
patio
o
tools
more
body
richer
would
drink
this
again
overall
very
good
beer
overall
this
would
be
great
on
a
cold
winter
evening
overall
very
very
nice
cigar
city
never
disappoints
cant
wait
to
have
another
overall
the
drinkability
is
nice
the
different
flavors
blend
well
d
nicely
done
very
drinkable
and
complex
after
popping
the
cap
i
gave
everyone
a
generous
pour
this
created
a
finger
of
dense
deeptanlightbrown
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
srm
44
allowing
zero
light
penetration
nose
was
really
rich
molasses
anise
light
charcoal
vanilla
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
only
medium
the
taste
was
semisweet
with
flavors
including
dried
dark
fruits
dark
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
smokiness
the
finish
was
dry
and
smoky
and
we
decided
to
go
in
a
different
direction
for
our
next
beer
this
is
a
dark
dark
brown
beer
with
a
short
white
head
the
nose
is
not
as
roasty
or
smokey
as
i
would
have
thought
it
would
but
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
some
molasses
some
smoke
and
a
little
licorice
come
through
the
taste
was
similar
with
what
started
as
a
slight
metallic
aftertaste
that
faded
as
it
warmed
and
gave
some
hints
of
anise
sage
and
rosemary
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
chocolate
smokiness
and
molasses
also
grew
as
it
warmed
i
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
as
it
warmed
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
medium
bodied
i
always
like
a
stout
with
a
little
more
body
than
this
one
but
it
worked
well
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
would
encourage
anyone
drinking
it
on
tap
to
give
it
sometime
o
it
must
be
the
combination
of
7
0
abv
and
48
ibus
that
makes
this
a
hit
for
me
bold
not
boozy
balanced
not
sugary
or
bitter
and
the
aroma
mmm
o
ive
been
sitting
on
this
one
for
longer
than
i
should
have
great
balance
of
flavors
a
very
nice
stout
that
i
was
expecting
nicely
done
o
a
nice
midfall
fes
with
a
good
mix
of
maltiness
and
yeast
character
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
found
at
a
nice
price
kinda
reminds
me
of
allagash
black
seek
some
out
o
nice
fes
not
a
ton
of
roasted
malt
character
outside
of
the
chocolate
lots
of
sweet
grains
balances
out
the
bitter
smoke
and
roasted
malt
flavors
are
pretty
well
integrated
and
smooth
probably
attributable
to
the
age
this
one
has
held
up
great
tasty
and
unique
fes
overall
exportstyle
drier
and
stronger
than
many
stouts
outstanding
a
worldclass
stout
edit
interesting
to
note
i
left
the
bottle
out
for
about
15
minutes
while
i
drank
first
glass
and
upon
pouring
the
second
glass
the
head
was
a
huge
at
least
3
fingers
worth
and
lacing
became
an
obvious
addition
o
pretty
good
not
a
lit
going
on
but
what
it
does
it
does
very
well
flavors
are
good
and
it
is
very
to
style
pretty
things
makes
good
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
o
overall
quite
tasty
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
this
is
not
as
chocolatey
as
other
foreign
export
stouts
but
still
quite
good
oa
good
beer
that
i
would
like
more
if
they
did
remove
that
smoked
malt
from
the
grain
bill
other
than
the
smokiness
and
the
weak
apperance
the
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
o
it
delivers
like
a
stout
should
im
sure
its
top
of
its
own
class
the
beer
pours
a
proper
stout
black
with
a
medium
sized
roasted
tan
head
on
top
that
quickly
fizzles
into
a
tight
scrim
that
causes
very
thin
droopy
lacing
the
body
is
impenetrable
to
the
eye
sitting
entirely
opaque
in
the
glass
but
seems
clear
of
sediment
and
haze
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
terrifically
bizarre
for
the
style
the
slight
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
are
there
but
they
play
second
fiddle
to
the
beers
dark
fruit
quadlike
smells
of
plums
and
raisin
and
even
a
slight
kiss
of
spicy
alcohol
the
beer
tastes
just
as
terrific
with
light
dark
fruit
notes
on
the
beginning
and
aftertaste
but
a
strong
roasted
coffee
stout
flavor
coming
through
in
the
middle
the
beer
begins
with
slight
sour
plum
and
raisin
before
opening
into
creamy
roasted
coffee
and
light
dark
chocolate
notes
while
sweet
raisin
and
slight
alcohol
linger
behind
the
roast
and
again
show
themselves
strongly
in
the
lingering
aftertaste
alongside
the
roasted
coffee
the
beer
feels
medium
to
medium
heavy
on
the
mouth
with
a
drying
feeling
in
the
face
and
sticky
dry
crackling
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
terrific
export
stout
with
a
belgian
yeast
flair
i
love
the
quadlike
characters
in
the
beer
as
they
add
a
nice
unique
twist
this
beer
is
a
must
try
for
stout
fans
and
another
success
from
pretty
things
as
well
as
a
goto
stout
for
me
of
course
theres
the
perfumy
lavender
notes
that
distinguish
this
winter
warmer
from
an
export
stout
that
could
come
around
any
time
of
the
year
but
the
spice
aids
in
aroma
but
distracts
in
taste
and
texture
added
fruit
esters
and
better
supporting
malt
sweetness
could
have
garnered
better
accolades
keep
in
mind
this
will
be
a
fan
favorite
for
those
that
prefer
extreme
roastiness
in
their
stouts
decent
interesting
to
say
the
least
o
a
pretty
good
but
not
great
stout
with
a
light
smoky
quality
overall
this
is
a
nice
stout
and
again
one
of
the
more
novicefriendly
ones
on
the
market
as
opposed
to
say
an
ash
bomb
but
suffers
from
a
lack
of
pizzazz
the
flavors
here
are
nice
but
light
and
the
watery
mouthfeel
doesnt
help
the
fact
that
the
beers
latter
notes
are
almost
exclusively
ash
seems
to
point
to
a
general
dearth
of
sugars
thus
the
low
abv
and
so
while
the
initial
flavors
are
good
they
lack
staying
power
overall
a
great
stout
theres
not
much
more
to
say
its
probably
a
better
cold
weather
beer
no
its
definitely
better
in
cold
weather
o
overall
spot
on
export
stout
really
nice
irish
flavorings
and
good
amount
of
char
easy
drinker
and
definitely
one
of
the
winners
in
the
pretty
things
lineup
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
stout
with
a
large
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
dry
roasted
malt
with
light
residual
sugar
notes
maybe
some
lactose
and
light
smoked
notes
taste
is
a
complex
mix
between
some
dry
roasted
malt
with
some
light
smoke
notes
and
some
light
spicy
malt
notes
body
is
quite
full
with
light
creamy
texture
and
good
carbonation
well
brewed
with
good
level
of
complexity
while
retaining
a
good
drinkability
level
o
nothing
short
of
trendsetting
a
stout
with
both
belgian
and
british
influences
who
would
have
guessed
that
it
would
have
worked
it
just
goes
to
show
what
a
great
brewer
can
do
with
the
right
ingredients
im
not
sure
what
i
paid
for
this
but
ill
take
another
bottle
please
bottled
112009
and
somehow
got
lost
until
tonight
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
faint
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
fluffy
tan
meringue
head
that
sticks
lots
of
lace
on
the
way
down
smells
of
roast
and
lots
of
caramel
dark
sugars
and
dark
fruits
spicy
earthy
aromas
remind
me
of
wood
and
ginger
the
flavor
is
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
stout
and
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
the
roasty
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
meet
some
spicy
and
earthy
flavor
reminiscent
of
some
dark
belgians
nice
sugary
fruity
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
bubbly
mouthfeel
this
probably
wasnt
the
best
candidate
for
aging
but
it
worked
just
the
same
its
a
very
nice
beer
o
this
was
a
very
interesting
and
fulfilling
stout
from
the
gypsy
brewers
at
pretty
things
the
7
abv
and
variety
of
malts
kept
this
stout
drinking
sturdy
and
the
traditional
hop
additions
kept
it
distinctly
american
however
the
british
and
belgian
yeast
strains
really
made
for
some
interesting
fruity
tart
and
spicy
flavors
that
might
have
gone
unnoticed
with
a
house
yeast
id
certainly
grab
it
again
o
points
for
flair
but
even
though
its
fascinating
it
always
seems
like
it
doesnt
quite
make
it
so
close
to
the
mark
but
it
never
quite
finds
its
way
there
still
worth
trying
and
perhaps
better
fresh
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
stout
the
balance
is
spot
on
here
with
a
great
mix
of
chocolate
coffee
and
a
touch
of
dark
fruit
sweetness

like

i
come
across

a
bomber
kind
of
surprised
to
see
new
stuff
from
pretty
things
all
the
way
out
on
the
west
coast
a
nice
pleasant
hearty
and
rustic
stout
mildly
smoky
and
seems
a
touch
of
spicy
on
there
as
well
its
a
good
winter
stout
even
though
there
are
parts
of
it
that
stand
out
in
their
own
ways
it
strikes
me
as
well
balanced
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
nice
fine
brown
head
with
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
mild
aroma
of
toasted
and
dark
malt
with
an
interesting
faint
estery
fruit
component
unusual
flavor
dominated
by
dark
malt
but
complex
earthy
with
unidentifiable
fruit
flavors
finish
is
a
touch
sour
reminiscent
of
rye
which
is
listed
as
an
ingredient
mixed
with
spicy
toasted
malt
and
coffee
unusual
combination
of
flavors
but
this
one
works
for
me
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
these
guys
push
the
envelope
but
seem
to
pull
it
off
i
would
get
this
again
if
it
was
available
in
my
state
o
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
i
definitely
get
the
woodland
feel
while
drinking
it
wish
pretty
things
made
six
packs
id
buy
this
year
round
kudos
to
you
pretty
things
overall
im
surprised
more
people
dont
love
this
stout
its
unique
with
great
layers
of
flavor
that
range
from
woods
herbs
and
fruit
with
an
underlining
roastiness
that
runs
across
everything
o
weird
beer
like
it
dont
love
it
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
there
are
some
interesting
tastes
in
this
brew
but
it
is
lacking
some
things
that
would
make
it
world
class
recommended
to
stout
lovers
to
try
taste
is
very
earthy
with
almost
a
burnt
taste
loads
of
hops
and
roasted
malt
it
comes
off
as
being
a
little
on
the
chemical
side
not
a
bad
beer
though
carbonation
is
adequate
and
this
beer
is
drinkable
o
gotta
say
it
was
just
a
decent
stout
and
was
probably
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
from
the
beers
tasted
today
from
pretty
things
enjoyed
the
previous
pretty
things
beers
ive
tried
but
this
was
a
slight
disappointment
unique
like
the
others
but
was
a
bit
harsh
and
not
all
that
cohesive
overall
very
interesting
beer
the
first
sip
is
a
little
overwhleming
but
after
a
few
sips
this
mellows
out
into
a
nice
complex
stout
has
some
strong
rauchbier
characteristics
d
the
various
components
imply
that
this
might
be
an
over
the
top
type
of
stout
but
it
is
actually
fairly
drinkable
and
the
more
unusual
flavoring
aspects
such
as
the
smoke
are
well
integrated
in
fact
it
almost
goes
too
far
into
being
a
smooth
well
balanced
beer
to
the
point
that
it
comes
across
as
kind
of
bland
in
the
finish
with
an
excessive
level
of
sweetness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
and
hurts
the
drinkability
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
d
100
drinkability
a
pretty
damn
good
stout
a
little
pricey
at
least
in
my
area
for
a
non
ba
stout
but
this
will
not
disappoint
definitely
worth
a
try
d
i
like
pt
this
one
is
not
my
favorite
however

mild
roast
and

great
stout
with
a
bit

pours
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
dark
chocolate
brown
in
color
with
a
one
finger
creamy
khaki
head
it
poured
exceptionally
smooth
the
aromas
are
interesting
its
a
little
earthy
it
has
a
certain
sweet
spice
to
it
and
smells
like
it
may
even
use
some
oat
the
flavors
feature
slight
soft
chocolate
some
sweet
spice
light
earth
with
a
touch
of
toffee
nice
and
mellow
flavor
it
drinks
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
but
it
very
smooth
increasing
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
nice
stout
it
had
a
certain
earthiness
to
it
that
makes
it
a
little
different
than
most
its
an
easy
drinker
and
for
8

pretty
cost
effective
22
oz
bottle
from
beer
revolution
in
oakland
quite
sippable
but
be
prepared
for
a
different
kind
of
smoke
if
you
like
riddles
or
just
the
idea
of
drinking
shrubs
then
this
is
a
beer
for
you
because
babayaga
is
not
only
a
fantastic
autumn
seasonal
but
an
especially
peculiar
and
curious
beer
it
is
almost
as
literally
as
figuratively
a
piece
of
abstract
modernist
art
rosemary
is
obvious
and
juniper
and
spruce
are
highly
suspected
but
the
real
mystery
is
not
what
ingredients
were
put
in
it
but
rather
what
exactly
makes
it
so
damn
drinkable
o
overall
a
good
stout
not
my
favorite
but
i
love
stouts
so
being
my
favorite
is
not
easy
there
are
some
interesting
notes
to
it
i
would
certainly
have
it
again
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
malt
dark
fruits
and
some
slight
cocoa
and
coffee
aromas
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
there
is
a
medium
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
roasty
stout
with
some
nice
smells
and
flavors
notes
yet
another
solid
beer
from
pretty
things
dr
quite
drinkable
but
also
boring
and
unremarkable
overall
overall
i
think
its
great
nothing
new
no
specific
strong
point
but
its
not
boring
by
any
means
a
good
stout
done
right
all
the
parts
are
blended
wonderfully
and
i
am
not
aware
of
whether
this
is
a
beer
skillfully
crafted
from
only
the
traditional
ingredients
or
a
masterful
mixing
of
herbs
etc
too
this
one
was
worth
waiting
for
now
where
can
i
get
another
o
unique
stout
from
a
consistently
solid
brewery
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
bring
a
bit
of
charcoal
to
the
nose
immediately
followed
by
sweet
chocolate
a
little
bit
of
oak
and
citrus
as
well
slight
bit
of
anise
and
a
ton
of
dark
malt
taste
is
initially
citrus
hop
flavors
immediately
followed
by
some
dark
fruit
and
chocolate
some
wooden
oak
flavors
along
with
a
hint
of
smoke
finishes
with
a
dash
of
clove
and
more
bitter
chocolate
maybe
some
espresso
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
rich
and
smooth
drinkability
is
fairly
high
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
it
lingers
nicely
between
stout
and
imperial
stout
with
some
complex
flavors
to
it
o
i
was
expecting
an
imperial
stout
for
some
reason
and
instead
got
an
american
stout
that
tastes
more
like
a
black
ipa
highly
bitter
with
a
good
amount
of
charred
roasty
malts
fruity
notes
are
apparent
along
with
some
subtle
spicing
o
overall
this
is
a
solid
offering
from
pretty
things
while
its
not
the
best
stout
on
the
market
it
is
one
that
is
readily
available
in
my
end
o
a
really
tasty
winter
stout
i
love
the
idea
and
its
pulled
off
effectively
the
price
is
tough
at
10
a
bomber
but
its
worth
a
try
at
least
once
d
a
solid
beer
not
that
big
of
fan
of
the
smoke
in
it
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
an
enjoyable
stout
overall
but
nothing
to
really
seperate
it
from
the
pack
pretty
dry
for
a
stout
would
like
to
try
fresh
overall
very
good
wanted
a
bit
more
alc
but
very
delicious
one
of
the
finer
beers
ive
had
from
this
brewer
nice
local
artisanal
product
on
tap
tonight
at
porter
cafe
in
west
roxbury
served
in
a
pretty
things
widemouthed
wine
glass
extremely
dark
brown
body
with
a
tremendous
looking
tan
head
this
glass
really
accentuates
the
look
of
the
beer
smell
was
subtly
earthy
taste
is
right
on
the
money
its
rich
with
flavors
of
chocolate
and
milky
coffee
with
just
enough
of
a
hint
of
smoke
to
enjoy
there
is
a
slight
mineral
quality
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
right
in
the
middle
not
too
thick
and
not
too
thin
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
stout
and
i
am
upset
with
myself
that
it
took
me
this
long
to
finally
try
it
o
officially
the
first
beer
with
a
smoked
component
that
i
have
enjoyed
chocolate
malt
abounds
so
if
youre
into
that
this
one
is
a
sure
winner
one
i
would
revisit
overall
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
from
pretty
things
easy
to
drink
great
smell
and
taste
the
taste
is
an
american
stout
the
beer
is
very
creamy
at
first
with
a
smooth
mouth
a
slight
bit
of
carbonation
hits
the
top
of
the
mouth
a
roasted
and
creaminess
linger
and
hints
of
roasted
malts
ehh
at
first
the
mouth
feel
was
good
enough
to
shadow
the
taste
nothing
special
about
the
favor
average
craft
stout
overall
a
funky
stout
with
a
bunch
of
flavor
and
the
rosemary
spice
really
come
through
here
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
beer
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
ok
stout
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
glad
i
had
in
taster
not
a
full
pint
id
didnt
really
pick
up
any
rosemary
or
other
stuff
in
the
beer
there
was
an
off
taste
like
metallic
maybe
thats
it
either
way
it
was
off
putting
to
me
overall
a
pleasant
and
one
of
a
kind
stout
really
well
done
with
nice
balance
throughout
i
would
get
this
again
odnot
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
really
enjoyed
how
strange
this
beer
is
very
very
complex
and
hard
to
accurately
describe
simply
put
i
really
like
it
pretty
things
is
a
blessing
a
real
flavorful
export
stout
with
a
good
balance
in
both
flavor
and
body
a
pleasant
choice
from
pretty
things
and
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
of
theirs
to
date
i
really
hope
pretty
things
continues
brewing
stouts
as
this
one
is
very
good
restrained
and
balanced
rather
than
brash
and
overpowering
this
is
a
really
nice
seasonal
offering
i
had
this
beer
ontap
this
past
summer
the
beer
poured
to
be
a
very
dark
brown
close
to
black
in
color
you
could
smell
a
strong
aroma
of
roasted
coffee
malts
and
caramel
upon
tasting
this
beer
there
was
a
bit
of
a
spice
to
ithard
to
decipher
where
the
spiciness
comes
from
this
beer
was
fullbodied
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
sweet
this
beer
was
very
enjoyable
cheers
very
full
bodied
but
goes
down
quite
easy
ill
be
having
a
few
more
of
these
mythical
brews
this
season
pretty
things
never
fails
me
tan
head
rises
up
above
an
entirely
black
body
wonderful
retention
leaves
it
several
inches
high
and
deposits
tons
of
side
glass
web
like
lace
the
smooth
vanilla
and
cocoa
aroma
melds
wonderfully
with
hints
of
coffee
and
a
touch
of
molasses
very
complex
here
as
i
take
a
sip
the
huge
full
bodied
feel
comes
in
waves
over
the
tongue
and
settles
down
with
a
wonderful
coating
feeling
of
sweet
chocolate
and
vanilla
as
this
fades
though
a
very
nice
bite
of
hops
comes
in
and
seals
the
deal
body
is
a
touch
thin
and
there
is
some
off
notes
going
on
in
the
finish
but
overall
i
think
it
really
worked
quite
nicely
this
should
be
classified
as
an
export
stout
beer
is
sweet
on
the
front
thinner
in
body
than
expected
strong
heavy
with
alcohol
the
midpalate
is
fruity
estery
filled
with
a
floral
sort
of
yeast
the
finish
is
relatively
dry
but
not
overly
so
it
is
odd
that
the
roast
bitterness
comes
up
almost
as
an
aftertaste
interesting
beer
overall
quite
good
o
a
decent
stout
very
middle
of
the
road
i
thought
it
was
good
and
id
have
it
again
just
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
cheers
beertracker
the
cpj
o
its
not
bad
but
there
was
nothing
that
stood
out
in
this
beer
have
had
a
bunch
of
other
beers
from
pretty
things
and
this
is
the
only
one
thusfar
that
is
a
disappointment
o
a
little
much
with
the
bitter
chocolate
finish
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
stout
though
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
coming
from
pretty
things
another
interesting
brew
from
this
project
and
worth
a
try
overall
a
pretty
ok
american
stout
it
has
its
flaws
but
i
like
the
smoked
malt
component
i
would
probably
have
it
again
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
it
again
i
highly
recommend
everything
ive
had
from
pretty
things
they
spend
a
lot
of
time
perfecting
their
flavors
pretty
drinkable
beer
surprisingly
big
for
a
stout
of
its
size
definitely
a
one
and
done
buy
very
pleasant
and
enjoyable
d
good
beer
not
great
but
good
it
has
some
characteristics
that
can
be
improved
it
could
use
with
some
balancing
flavors
in
addition
to
what
it
has
but
i
like
it
really
wish
i
shared
this
with
some
other
bas
roasty
very
earthy
middle
manure
tobacco
unripe
black
fruits
some
sour
cherry
and
prune
a
bit
of
bitter
cocoa
and
just
kind
of
a
weird
tinny
quality
on
the
back
end
some
type
of
unmalted
barley
flavor
that
is
kind
of
offputting
d
again
not
bad
a
tad
bit
too
much
smokiness
and
char
for
my
stoutloving
preferences
but
given
the
ingredient
mix
the
brewer
was
obviously
going
for
something
different
and
succeeded
in
that
regard
finally
tried
this
as
i
am
getting
more
into
dark
beers
and
stouts
and
i
love
pretty
things
the
beer
is
a
dark
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
drops
slowly
smells
of
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
i
assocaite
with
belgiam
yeast
the
taste
is
similar
but
with
surprising
bitterness
a
great
freakin
brew
thanks
dan
however
this
also
makes
it
a
bit
hard
to
grade
if
grading
to
the
style
it
certainly
falls
short
of
what
traditional
stouts
are
but
as
a
beer
itself
its
interesting
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
a
great
first
impression
for
this
brewery
and
i
have
another
bottle
from
this
bif
that
i
am
looking
forward
to
and
from
there
ill
hopefully
expand
further
d
the
stout
is
quite
easy
to
drink
because
it
isnt
very
filling
d
a
low
enough
abv
to
enjoy
a
couple
of
these
unfortunately
they
arent
sold
here
and
this
is
my
only
bottle
ive
got
an
09
bottle
ill
be
sampling
soon
to
compare
am
wondering
if
the
bitter
will
fade

bottle
pours
black
with
a
thick
chocolate
colored
head
aroma
of
roasted
malt
a
slight
smoke
presence
flavor
of
smoke
earthy
hops
roasted

an
interesting
stout
with
a
distinct
woodsyoakyearthy
presence
and
of
course
nice
smokey
notes
very
tasty
and
super
drinkable
pours
with
dark
rich
color
and
creamy
consistency
its
subtle
yet
appealing
aroma
are
matched
only
by
its
smooth
flavor
and
mouth
feel
babayaga
has
a
medium
yet
thick
head
my
only
criticism
is
that
babayagas
hut
moves
around
on
three
hens
legs
not
four
but
this
is
a
beer
not
a
fairy
tale
although
after
finishing
this
fine
stout
youll
feel
as
if
youve
been
transported
in
time
babayaga
pours
black
no
hint
of
light
even
when
directly
backlit
yet
it
doesnt
feel
as
dark
as
many
larger
stouts
would
pour
what
was
admittedly
an
overly
harsh
pour
yields
a
mountain
of
rocky
caramel
colored
foam
easily
more
than
four
fingers
worth
the
nose
is
fairly
muted
but
i
can
discern
some
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
rosemary
the
flavor
is
much
better
with
a
big
blast
of
milk
chocolate
followed
by
a
brief
flourish
of
coffee
kicking
things
off
the
back
end
is
an
excellent
blend
of
rosemary
and
a
bit
of
smokiness
this
is
the
first
beer
that
i
can
really
say
just
tastes
like
winter
the
carbonation
is
pitch
perfect
on
the
low
end
of
the
spectrum
but
still
very
lively
the
beers
a
little
dry
though
for
my
taste
and
i
wish
there
was
just
a
bit
more
heft
behind
it
this
beer
is
another
great
offering
from
pretty
things
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
winter
brews
i
only
wish
i
had
a
fireplace
because
i
cant
imagine
a
much
better
way
to
spend
a
frigid
night
like
this
than
sitting
in
front
of
a
roaring
fire
and
sipping
on
some
babayaga
d
drinkable
for
sure
but
i
just
dont
care
for
what
belgian
yeast
does
to
stouts
not
up
my
alley
but
not
an
offensive
beer
worth
trying
for
sure
but
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
d
this
isnt
a
super
huge
beer
but
its
no
slouch
im
thinking
some
big
porter
or
a
medium
sized
stout
but
i
like
it
interesting
beer
as
usual
from
pretty
things
fairly
solid
stout
got
better
as
it
warmed
didnt
detect
all
the
components
claimed
on
the
bottle
but
those
that
i
did
were
subtle
as
they
should
be
its
not
a
stylebender
like
jack
dor
was
and
certainly
not
as
mindblowing
but
if
its
true
that
every
great
brewer
has
to
produce
a
great
export
stout
then
i
suppose
the
paquettes
can
be
officially
anointed
as
such
as
if
there
was
any
doubt
babayaga
is
a
great
drink
and
it
is
not
your
run
of
the
mill
stout
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
friends
split
this
bottle
and
almost
wish
i
didnt
good
balance
good
complexity
and
alcohol
is
well
hidden
very
good
i
really
like
the
idea
of
malt
smoked
over
rosemary
but
its
just
not
coming
through
here
the
base
beer
is
pretty
tasty
though
d
a
really
unique
and
tasty
spin
on
a
stout
great
drinkability
on
this
one
and
a
relatively
light
body
yum
thanks
andy
for
the
bottle
poured
into
a
tulip
the
beer
appears
very
dark
brown
with
just
a
thin
layer
of
mocha
head
that
fizzes
away
quickly
the
aroma
is
mostly
big
dark
malts
for
me
with
a
bit
of
smoke
and
bits
of
dark
chocolate
and
earthy
aromas
the
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
pretty
nicely
lots
of
barley
and
malt
flavors
with
kind
of
a
dirty
finish
the
best
adjective
i
can
think
of
for
this
one
is
rustic
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
silky
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
relatively
light
body
good
drinkablity
and
certainly
unique
to
me
judging
by
the
reviews
from
last
year
batch
1
used
to
have
more
roast
flavors
id
like
them
back
their
saisons
jack
dor
and
fieldmouses
farewell
are
delicious
babayaga
right
now
is
yet
another
almostthere
beer
from
pretty
things
its
quite
interesting
but
i
feel
like
with
a
few
tweaks
and
smoothing
out
this
could
be
much
better
i
love
this
brewery
because
everything
they
make
is
offkilter
and
a
delight
to
drink
but
much
like
some
young
forestdwelling
critter
itll
take
a
few
years
for
this
pretty
things
to
grow
to
the
fullness
of
its
being
keep
your
eyes
on
this
little
brewery
i
like
this
beer
i
like
it
alot
i
like
that
its
not
10
percent
and
its
not
overly
heavy
i
drank
it
with
ease
i
am
steadily
impressed
with
pretty
things
beers
a
good
company
drinkability
not
too
shabby
i
enjoy
the
smells
and
flavors
but
i
do
wish
it
was
thicker
in
the
body
the
abv
isnt
awfully
high
but
it
could
easily
sneak
up
on
anyone
d
interesting
and
tasty
stuff
another
brew
from
pretty
things
that
ive
enjoyed
very
much
this
was
a
november
09
bottle
so
i
wonder
what
it
was
like
fresh
one
of
the
better
pretty
things
beers
ive
had
pretty
solid
for
a
stout
notes
a
super
drystyle
stout
was
not
expecting
that
at
all
toasty
and
bitter
but
i
prefer
a
little
more
sweetness
just
personal
preference
really
well
done
if
you
like
dry
stouts
d
a
decent
stout
some
nice
roasted
elements
to
the
smell
and
taste
would
give
another
shot
but
probably
not
seek
out
this
beer
should
be
skipped
no
need
to
pursue
i
dont
have
the
best
palate
but
hans
the
närke
ownerbrewer
agreed
with
me
and
we
moved
on
so
im
comfortable
in
my
score
d
meh
i
though
that
this
was
a
very
good
stout
though
perhaps
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
carbonation
is
nice
and
at
7
abv
not
too
bad
as
a
dessert
beer
not
entirely
sure
what
woodland
stout
or
sylvan
stout
on
the
label
mean
d
i
wouldnt
revisit
this
but
it
was
interesting
to
try
d
this
is
yet
another
pretty
things
beer
that
knocks
itself
out
of
the
ballpark
this
brewery
has
yet
to
do
anything
wrong
in
my
book
looking
forward
to
getting
more
pretty
things
d
good
beer
but
it
was
a
little
too
hot
to
have
when
we
did
i
did
not
want
to
hold
onto
it
over
the
summer
this
one
was
bottles
in
november
0f
09
and
just
never
got
around
to
it
till
now
still
great
would
be
great
around
a
fire
drinkability
love
the
creativity
and
love
the
flavor
kudos
d
too
much
for
his
85
degree
day
i
wish
it
was
cold
again
alot
of
licorice
flavors
here
with
a
healthy
dose
of
yeasty
esters
medium
fruits
like
strawberries
and
cantaloupe
make
their
way
to
the
parade
in
the
middle
and
is
followed
up
by
a
decent
amount
of
roast
and
hop
bitterness
not
a
very
sweet
beer
especially
for
a
stout
mouthfeel
could
use
a
tad
more
heft
and
creaminess
alcohol
is
plenty
noticeable
and
i
would
not
mind
some
more
chocolate
and
a
little
sweetness
not
bad
but
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
d
meh
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
was
just
ok
there
are
several
locally
available
options
that
i
would
go
for
before
this
however
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
beers
from
this
brewery
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
more
than
most
stouts
but
it
makes
it
interesting
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
the
beer
has
a
nice
dry
finish
the
alcohol
is
well
incorporated
into
the
flavor
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
will
certainly
revisit
this
one
really
impressed
me
as
i
love
the
use
of
smoked
malts
to
add
to
the
complexity
without
turning
it
into
a
fullon
smoked
beer
great
beer
very
very
very
burnt
taste
taste
like
wood
cinders
in
a
good
way
thick
kind
of
alcoholly
has
a
cherry
taste
dry
aftertaste
quite
strong
a
decent
beer
but
one
i
wouldnt
seek
out
pours
black
with
a
smallish
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
roasty
phenolic
tastes
of
roasted
malts
awkwardly
tart
peppery
with
a
sort
of
belgian
phenolic
character
and
dry
finish
body
feels
properly
full
though
carbonation
is
a
bit
overdone
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
much
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
light
fluffy
tan
head
fades
to
a
thick
ring
of
bubbles
with
a
few
streaks
of
lacing
aroma
is
slightly
astringent
and
bittersweet
charred
roast
malt
chocolate
and
slightly
nutty
overall
very
rich
and
varied
aroma
flavor
and
body
sort
of
reminds
me
of
an
oatmeal
stout
but
flavors
are
richer
and
i
dont
know
the
word
rustic
is
coming
to
mind
but
i
just
might
have
the
artwork
stuck
in
my
head
there
is
a
strong
charred
roasted
malt
body
supporting
a
blend
of
earthy
dark
chocolate
toasted
malt
dark
fruits
and
smokiness
body
is
medium
full
but
seems
over
carbonated
and
overly
fluffy
on
the
palate
the
finish
is
astringent
and
slightly
off
with
a
potent
charred
earthy
medicinal
flavor
very
robust
and
rich
throughout
with
a
surprising
amount
of
alcohol
warming
and
burn
for
such
a
low
abv
lots
of
interesting
flavors
but
overall
i
dont
really
enjoy
the
combination
or
the
way
they
complement
or
dont
each
other
regardless
a
very
unique
stout
worth
seeking
out
for
at
least
once
fourth
pt
beer
for
me
first
one
i
have
really
loved
this
stout
hits
me
in
all
the
right
places
the
beer
pours
an
inky
black
color
with
a
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
fruity
with
some
light
smoke
the
flavor
is
sweet
fruit
sometimes
dark
fruit
and
sometimes
other
fruit
such
as
cherries
the
smoke
is
of
medium
strength
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
its
cool
how
such
small
brewera
from
across
the
us
find
their
way
to
bc
this
is
a
stout
that
seems
to
be
hard
to
pigeonhole
as
it
is
somewhere
between
an
imperial
and
an
oatmeal
in
flavour
profile
the
belgian
yeast
shows
up
too
to
add
to
the
mix
i
had
to
let
the
beer
warm
up
and
assert
itself
to
really
appreciate
this
beer
the
chocolate
notes
were
there
in
force
but
i
also
tasted
smoky
flavours
and
coffee
complex
beer
that
is
quite
different
than
most
stouts
d
this
is
a
unique
stout
flavors
play
nicely
off
one
another
goes
down
easily
and
is
worthy
of
sitting
with
for
a
few
pints
the
drinkability
is
good
it
packs
substantial
roasted
punch
that
sometimes
cuts
down
drinkability
but
here
it
reaches
the
upper
limit
of
balance
but
doesnt
cross
my
line
a
very
unique
and
very
good
stout
i
hope
this
remains
a
seasonal
i
could
see
this
being
one
of
the
beers
i
look
forward
to
every
year
comments
i
would
guess
some
of
the
reviews
citing
an
off
flavor
are
likely
not
taking
the
belgian
character
of
this
stout
into
account
not
your
typical
american
stoutwhich
is
a
very
good
thing
the
last
thing
i
want
is
another
me
too
stout
bravo
pretty
things
as
with
all
the
other
beer
ive
had
from
pt
this
one
contains
many
good
components
but
everything
fails
to
come
together
as
a
whole
if
they
cut
out
some
of
the
alcohol
and
backed
off
the
chocolate
taste
this
could
be
a
good
bottle
of
stout
as
it
is
now
it
gave
me
a
headache
d
this
wasnt
a
particularly
good
beer
and
another
let
down
from
pretty
things
the
body
is
appropriate
for
the
style
north
of
medium
but
not
overly
so
again
a
straightforward
take
on
a
straightforward
style
a
22oz
bottle
bottled
nov2009
in
a
tulip
glass
the
beer
was
a
black
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
diminished
fairly
quickly
mostly
aa
sweet
chocolate
aroma
but
also
a
little
bit
of
coffee
chocolate
dominated
the
taste
still
that
little
bit
of
coffee
there
was
also
a
hint
of
licorice
a
nice
dry
smooth
beer
very
dark
with
a
dark
brown
cap
lots
of
thick
lacing
good
head
retention
aroma
was
a
bit
roasty
some
chocolate
with
sort
of
a
funky
fruity
undertone
quite
mild
overall
same
with
the
flavour
its
nice
but
also
on
the
mild
side
dry
malt
flavour
with
a
bit
of
bitterness
sweet
cocoa
and
a
bit
of
roast
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
smooth
texture
quite
enjoyable
yeah
this
has
very
nice
drinkability
the
abv
is
moderate
and
its
easy
drinking
this
is
not
terribly
complicated
but
has
no
major
defects
all
negatives
aside
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
paired
with
the
lack
of
an
alcoholic
bite
and
the
ease
with
which
this
beer
goes
down
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
22oz
bomber
purchased
at
the
liquor
shoppe
in
tygsborro
mass
pours
an
opaque
pitch
black
body
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
as
it
dissipates
coffee
dark
chocolate
nut
and
wood
comprise
the
aroma
coffee
toast
and
dark
chocolate
hit
at
first
becoming
much
fuller
and
richer
as
the
sip
settles
in
wood
and
nut
are
present
in
the
background
but
only
as
an
accent
and
balance
fullbodied
with
ample
carbonation
to
aid
drinkability
the
profoundness
of
the
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
flavor
makes
this
not
only
superdelicious
but
one
of
the
best
for
the
style
ive
had
more
please
md
thinner
than
i
expected
but
not
offensively
so
a
nice
flavor
combination
layered
nicely
light
on
the
palate
and
easy
to
drink
pretty
things
continues
to
make
a
name
for
themself
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
levels
overall
this
beer
was
passable
but
not
something
i
would
go
back
to
without
the
metallic
notes
it
would
have
been
pleasing
but
still
simple

this
a
good
brew
that
is
different
in
a
way
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
more
glasses
of
this
it
reminds
me
of
a
thin
abyss
with
the
sulfur
and
smoke
i
like
this
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
probably
too
much
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
dark
chocolate
to
black
in
color
with
brownwhite
head
which
leaves
a
thin
residual
layer
smell
is
peppery
smoky
beefy
bacon
backyard
bbq
taste
is
very
very
good
as
predicted
by
the
smell
smoky
tobacco
black
licorice
on
some
sips
there
is
a
slight
medicinal
aftertaste
which
is
the
only
down
side
of
this
beer
feel
is
creamy
smooth
easily
drinkable
especially
for
a
7
stout
great
beer
from
an
up
and
coming
local
brewery
as
always
danns
beer
are
fabulous
this
beer
is
a
great
simple
7abv
stout
id
almost
call
this
a
session
stout
i
wish
i
could
describe
this
beer
better
but
its
just
so
not
simple
but
perfect
its
a
perfect
stout
while
not
amazing
this
is
a
nice
well
balanced
calm
stout
alcohol
isnt
detectable
feel
is
smooth
but
thinner
than
desired
very
drinkable
this
is
not
an
imperial
stout
yet
it
has
lots
of
flavor
and
probably
resides
somewhere
between
a
regular
stout
and
an
imperial
one
it
occupies
a
nice
spot
on
that
scale
because
there
is
a
ton
of
flavor
without
being
too
heavy
and
alcoholic
very
drinkable
and
another
mighty
fine
brew
from
pretty
things
dtasty
beer
enjoyable
worth
trying
seems
like
a
pretty
good
brewery
that
is

jeez
can
pretty
things
do
no

this
is
an
excellent
winter

strong

robust
without
being

heavy
and
syrupy
loved
the
lingering
smokiness
and
roasty

taste
hmmm
fruitier

i

perhaps
wow
interesting
stout
and
very
good
d
moderate
id
have
another
one
a
unique
beer
perhaps
its
an
acquired
taste
but
my
least
favorite
pretty
things
to
date
thats
the
way
the
cookie
crumbles
sometimes
still
love
most
of
their
beers
i
recommend
this
one
highly
pours
a
black
color
with
a
dark
tan
creamy
head
that
settles
into
a
rocky
cap
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
light
tin
and
a
sweet
milk
stout
if
an
aroma
can
smell
silky
this
does
the
aroma
is
not
strong
but
sure
is
smooth
the
taste
is
quite
mellow
with
bitter
and
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
feel
of
this
brew
is
outrageous
it
has
an
obvious
full
body
but
feels
light
and
fluffy
soft
carbonation
leads
to
a
very
smooth
and
silky
feel
much
like
a
frothy
head
to
a
milk
shake
finishes
with
a
light
roasted
malt
bitterness
a
very
silky
stout
indeed
not
huge
on
flavor
but
that
is
fine
as
it
has
a
solid
roasted
malt
flavor
medium
to
low
carbonation
with
a
borderline
oily
mouthfeel
im
unsure
how
to
compare
this
to
other
american
stouts
its
kind
of
at
an
inbetween
profile
abvwise
what
the
hell
is
a
sylvan
stout
anyway
overall
i
kind
of
feel
like
this
beer
is
underwhelming
its
solid
and
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
i
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
just
because
of
its
price
point
and
availability
there
are
some
better
options
out
there
that
i
could
almost
get
a
6pk
of
for
the
price
of
this
22oz
still
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
another
beer
from
a
brewery
that
has
yet
to
disappoint

the
body
is
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
aroma
contains
notes
of
roasted
barley
chocolate
malt
mild
black
cherry
tones
this
beer
just
appears
and
smells
hearty
and
wholesome
taste
contains
flavors
up
front
of
roasted
malt
grain
that
mellows
out
when
this
happens
more
chocolate
malt
can
be
tasted

some
citris
from
what
is
the
beginning
of
a

beer
finish

the

and
comes
in
with
a
bit

tobacco
hint
aftertaste
leaves
the
roasted
charry
flavor
from
the
grains
and
bittering
hops
dancing
on
the
palate
at

this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
delicious
the
taste
will
not
disappoint
the
beer
gets
high
marks
for
overall
creaminess
and
slight
oily
quality
on
the
tongue
it
has
a
full
palate
of
dark
malts
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
there
is
just
a
touch
of
sweeter
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
prickliness
at
the
very
beginning
but
this
segues
out
into
more
bittering
flavors
the
beer
has
a
strong
roasted
quality
and
is
loaded
with
dark
unsweetened
malts
there
is
less
chocolate
flavors
than
i
would
have
liked
the
coffee
is
slight
as
well
which
is
okay
by
me
it
is
the
charred
dark
malts
and
roasted
flavors
and
slight
bittering
dryness
in
the
finish
that
defines
this
beer
it
is
a
substantial
full
palated
affair
a
moderate
stout
profiletheres
notable
alcohol
in
the
swallow
the
body
is
lighter
than
most
stouts
but
the
carbonation
is
low
enough
to
have
the
beer
feel
right
the
aftertaste
has
toasted
bread
flavors

a

nice
fresh
and
tasty
beer
always
interested
in
giving
a
new
brew
from
hyper
artisinal
pretty
things
a
try
pours
pretty
darn
near
black
the
head
also
is
a
quite
dark
shade
of
mocha
head
is
of
moderate
height
and
shows
much
better
then
average
staying
power
then
turns
to
a
thick
film
and
collar
and
leaves
slippery
and
sliding
sheeting
and
ample
ridges
and
ripples
of
lacing
the
sniff
emits
healthy
notes
of
vanilla
dark
malt
raisins
and
chocolate
rich
and
flavorfull
stout
more
of
the
same
flavors
on
the
tongue
and
mouth
smooth
and
comfortable
mouthfeel
more
then
typical
roastyness
after
trying
several
of
the
other
eclectic
pt
brews
i
was
unsure
of
what
to
expect
from
a
sylvan
stout
whatever
that
is
from
them
what
i
got
was
a
pretty
straight
ahead
heartyrobustflavorful
and
underneath
it
all
tasty
and
enjoyable
stout
nice
job
and
well
worth
giving
this
one
a
try
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
oily
and
biting
with
a
big
bite
of
carbonation
keeping
it
from
being
too
overbearing
and
making
it
nicely
drinkable
overall
probably
not
my
favorite
pretty
things
but
overall
very
good
gotta
love
the
artwork
and
these
guys
are
doing
great
things
if
i
may
an
edit
to
this
review
as
i
had
the
new
batch
on
draft
tonight
101910
it
is
nothing
like
i
remember
before
with
sour
tart
cherries
in
the
mouth
right
away
i
dont
want
to
say
infection
right
away
though
it
very
well
could
be
then
it
becomes
extremely
sweet
like
a
milk
stout
with
subtle
tobacco
leather
molasses
and
light
cherry
wood
smoke
notes
followed
by
a
bitter
hop
taste
it
looks
good
but
not
all
that
drinkable
the
numbers
i
give
it
here
are
a4
5

d3
i
know
its
not
a
fair
comparison
but
this
is
what
i
want
guinness
to
taste
like
any
time
i
order
a
pint
overall
a
truly
impressive
beer
not
sure
what
a
sylvan
stout
is
but
i
like
it
and
wish
i
could
get
it
here
this
seasonal
offering
is
absolutely
delicious
and
superbly
flavorful
i
would
say
that
a
couple
glasses
of
this
may
be
filling
but
it
would
work
perfectly
as
a
digestif
and
will
definitely
keep
you
warm
on
a
cold
winters
night
i
have
had
this
beer
twice
since
it
was
just
released
in
bombers
and
i
have
had
mixed
feelings
on
it
lets
see
how
it
is
out
of
the
bottle
appearance
is
quite
dark
with
some
rocky
tan
heading
that
is
slow
to
settle
it
has
the
aroma
of
an
export
stout
with
some
burnt
coffee
bean
bitter
in
places
and
a
hint
of
smoke
one
gets
a
good
dose
of
bitter
coffee
smoke
and
slight
chocolate
from
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
relatively
heavy
making
it
a
sipper
for
me
alcohol
is
well
hidden
within
all
that
smoke
not
half
bad
i
do
not
really
get
the
belgian
aspect
of
this
beer
but
it
certainly
passes
for
me
as
an
export
or
robust
stout
on
the
lower
end
of
the
totem
pole
as
far
as
pretty
things
beers
go
but
worth
a
try
no
doubt
cheers
d
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
try
especially
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
a
little
different
it
is
a
bit
more
of
a
winter
warmer
in
my
opinion
and
worth
trying
once
but
this
is
not
my
favorite
from
pretty
things
f
it
finishes
semi
bitter
and
a
nice
slight
hoppy
flavor
the
rich
creamy
chocolate
also
sticks
around
giving
you
memories
of
being
a
kid
and
drinking
the
chocolate
milk
from
the
carton
most
of
the
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
have
subsided
by
the
finish
the
bitter
earthy
charred
stoutlike
flavors
present
themselves
quite
a
bit
at
the
end
probably
accentuated
by
the
bittering
hops
although
except
for
the
coat
of
chocolate
and
caramel
that
coats
the
mouth
and
tongue
it
finishes
pretty
clean
brewed
out
of
the
now
defunct
buzzards
bay
brewery
overall
carbonation
problems
seem
to
plague
this
brew
but
putting
that
aside
it
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
o
overall
a
decent
stout
i
think
it
may
have
been
on
its
way
to
infection
but
i
didnt
sense
anything
in
the
nose
or
taste
just
the
carbonation
would
like
to
try
it
again
sometime
taste
is
roasty
sweet
and
fruity
all
at
the
same
time
interesting
mix
but
does
not
quite
equal
uberdeliciousness
tasty
though
to
be
sure
i
like
the
rich
molasses
and
fineground
hop
effort
both
flavoring
and
bittering
are
nice
cocoa
powder
atop
a
dripping
roasting
marshmallow
nice
brew
this
one
o
damn
this
one
had
some
serious
promise
i
will
have
to
look
for
another
bottle
someday
o
no
shame
in
drainpouring
an
infectedbad
brew
this
one
isnt
awfully
offensive
but
its
certainly
not
worth
drinking
id
welcome
a
second
chance
at
it
overall
drinkability
is
good
strong
roasted
character
but
not
overdone
or
too
aggressive
good
balance
very
nice
looking
beerdeep
black
with
a
healthy
looking
tan
head
rather
average
aroma
grainy
and
roasted
thats
about
all
heavy
roasted
flavors
with
a
leaning
towards
chocolate
malt
mild
espresso
ok
mouthfeelvery
drying
in
the
finish
drinkable
enough
but
could
use
a
bit
of
an
umph
to
make
it
really
stand
out
good
enough
beer
for
the
price
for
sure
drinkability
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
that
a
few
tweaks
couldnt
improve
it
wasnt
meant
to
be
anything
huge
it
seems
it
is
a
pleasantly
drinkable
stout
but
i
dont
think
it
fits
the
fes
style
particularly
closely
you
do
have
to
give
it
some
credit
for
holding
onto
its
huge
carbonation
throughout
the
bottle
overall
wildly
roasted
toasted
brew
without
a
lot
else
going
on
but
i
like
roast
bring
it
on
good
beer

d
not
a
great
beer
but
not
a
bad
one
either
if
the
carbonation
was
fixed
this
brew
drank
fine
i
was
left
wanting
for
more
it
was
a
good
session
brew
and
overall
a
good
stout
besides
being
plenty
tasty
a
reasonably
low
abv
keeps
this
one
very
drinkable
dthis
is
quite
a
nice
stout
to
sip
on
it
is
lighter
and
brings
some
good
flavor
definitely
a
stout
to
drink
on
d
interesting
but
just
so
thick
satisfying
but
big

overall
i
thought
this
was
very
nicely
done
i
would
have
no
problem
at
all
with
going
through
this
one
again
it
was
very
solid
and
i
would
love
to
give
it
another
try
i
really
think
they
did
an
excellent
job
on
this
one
overall
not
a
terrible
stout
by
any
means
but
not
one
that
i
found
overly
remarkable
overall
a
great
americanmade
foreignstyle
stout
roasty
complex
and
oh
so
smooth
definitely
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
have
this
one
drinkability
i
expected
this
buckeye
to
be
pretty
good
stout
and
let
me
just
say
that
i
wasnt
disappointed
it
had
all
the
dark
roasted
flavors
i
was
looking
for
but
i
think
the
carbonation
level
was
a
bit
too
much
for
this
beer
if
youre
looking
to
try
a
good
roasted
buckeye
beer
then
get
yourself
a
mammoth
stout
just
remember
to
pour
it
slowly
into
your
glass
aftertaste

22
oz
bottle
pours
nearly
black
with
an
insane
amount
of
tan
carbonated
head
took
several
pours
to
get
an
acceptable
amount
into
my
glass
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
and
slight
roast
malt
initial
flavor
is
more
chocolate
than
coffee
after
taste
was
slightly
dryer
than
the
initial
flavor
and
it
did
not
linger
on
for
very
long
lots
of
carbonation
some
lacing
medium
body
light
on
the
alcohol
the
beer
was
drinkable
simple
in

ive
come
to
appreciate
most
of
the
offerings
coming
out
of
buckeye
brewing
company
which
is
why
i
refuse
to
let
this
bottle
of
mammoth
stout
color
my
impressions
of
what
im
sure
is
a
much
better
beer
than
the
one
that
entered
my
glass
today
ill
pick
up
another
bomber
the
next
time
im
in
the
buckeye
state
and
will
do
another
review
with
a
beer
that
is
hopefully
as
the
brewers
intended
i
like
a
lively
pour
and
this
was
a
big
noisy
pour
with
a
nice
dark
brown
bubbly
head
smell
was
pleasantly
sweet
but
subtle
taste
was
good
in
all
you
want
for
the
style
slightly
bitter
like
black
coffee
and
dry
there
were
nice
hints
of
coffee
and
licorice
as
well
well
done
and
would
love
to
see
more
brewers
try
this
style
could
be
a
decent
beer
seems
light
for
its
mammoth
moniker
just
too
carbonated
to
truly
enjoy
i
hope
the
next
batch
is
corrected
as
soon
as
i
started
the
pour
bubbles
just
shot
everywhere
into
my
pint
glass
it
took
the
beer
a
while
to
settle
down
before
i
could
pour
close
to
a
full
glass
after
it
settled
the
beer
was
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
frothy
carbonated
brown
head
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
coffee
and
some
sweet
chocolate
it
tasted
the
same
way
except
it
has
some
hop
flavor
too
along
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
the
beer
has
a
medium
mouthfeel
but
with
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
but
with
that
being
said
it
did
go
down
pretty
smooth
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
tastes
and
smells
great
hopefully
the
next
batch
will
have
a
little
less
carbonation
to
make
it
more
drinkable
because
i
would
like
to
drink
this
again
its
a
nice
stout
my
only
concern
is
that
its
a
little
onedimensional
mouthfeel
is
smokey
bitter
and
dry
like
some
old
coffee
thats
been
in
the
pot
for
too
long
buckeye
mammoth
stout
was
pleasant
but
not
spectacular
the
lack
of
head
in
a
beer
with
this
carbonation
level
was
peculiar
but
still
a
decent
stout
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
just
shy
of
a
medium
bodied
beer
the
beer
drinks
very
well
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
beer
i
think
this
would
make
an
excelent
session
beer
it
is
mild
and
not
aggressive
i
could
drink
this
beer
for
hours
thanks
david
for
bringing
it
to
me
this
beer
isnt
as
thick
as
the
mammoth
tag
implies
this
beer
has
good
drinkability
this
could
be
a
nice
stout
session
beer
noticed
the
new
black
white
label
so
i
figured
i
would
try
this

with
a
tasty

a
bit
of
bitter
chocolate
as
well
the
finish
is
dry
with
bitter
coffee

hops
the

may
be
duller
now
but
the
beer
certainly
is
not

one
of
the
best

beer
ive
ever

shall
buy
more

with
a
reduced

its
unbeatable
thanks
to
buckeye

for
a
memorable
400th
review
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
take
my
two
favorite
styles
stoutipa
and
combine
them
and
this
is
what
you
come
up
with
crazy
but
good
dont
drink
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
classic
example
of
the
style
this
however
defines
extreme
beer
i
discovered
this
still
available
at
one
of
the
stores
so
will
see
if
it
was
helped
by
a
little
aging
it
poured
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
and
formed
a
nice
foamy
medium
tan
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
burnt
coffee
and
chocolate
a
flavor
of
malt
and
coffee
the
finish
is
bittersweet
with
a
touch
of
sourness
not
a
bad
stout
but
its
hard
to
place
what
its
trying
to
be
overall
a
good
offering
from
buckeye
brewing
excellent
appearance
although
my
bottle
may
have
been
a
little
overcarbonated
the
head
is
dense
and
a
dark
tan
and
the
body
is
absolutely
black
the
aroma
has
a
hoppy
bite
along
with
a
mocha
and
charcoal
the
flavor
is
a
little
dusty
and
offdry
excellent
dry
stout
another
great
beer
from
buckeye
this
reminds
me
more
of
an
imperial
stout
than
a
foreignexport
but
either
way
its
quite
enjoyable
nice
richness
and
one
id
love
to
see
again
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thick
head
that
eventually
laced
nicely
down
the
glass
the
color
was
an
opaque
black
leaving
the
impression
that
this
would
indeed
have
the
burnt
malt
flavor
of
a
guiness
to
my
surprise
it
was
everybit
as
sweet
as
its
malty
chocolate
aroma
it
was
even
more
bitter
than
i
had
expected
with
a
crazy
mouthfeel
from
the
tip
all
the
way
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
all
in
all
i
will
be
indulging
in
the
beer
frequently
now
that
i
have
discovered
it
thank
you
buckeye
brewing
company
overall
a
bit
too
burnt
and
roasty
and
i
also
didnt
care
for
the
mouthfeel
but
the
beer
has
its
attributes
and
is
worth
a
try
pretty
much
to
style
but
nothing
too
exotic
or
exciting
here
conclusion
a
very
good
dark
beer
i
have
always
liked
this
style
but
often
found
american
versions
to
be
uninspired
i
personally
think
the
guiness
foreign
extra
to
be
an
outstanding
beer
and
the
benchmark
for
the
style
and
although
this
is
beer
isnt
quite
at
that
level
it
is
doing
its
own
thing
and
doing
it
well
worth
being
proud
of
for
upslope
i
could
drink
this
regularly
o
its
alright
i
dont
know
if
id
drink
it
again
because
i
favor
left
hands
fade
to
black
but
i
was
craving
a
stout
and
it
satisfied
my
craving
edit
yep
it
is
referred
to
so
i
guess
this
is
what
the
brewer
intended
pours
a
very
dark
black
and
smelled
coffee
right
off
the
bat
the
head
went
away
about
immediately
the
nose
has
plenty
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
some
toasted
walnuts
flavor
is
pretty
good
not
too
bold
like
other
stouts
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
for
being
over
8
there
are
no
trace
amounts
of
alcohol
dry
finish
with
lingering
flavors
of
coffee
and
chocolate
very
good
its
not
a
knockyoursocks
off
stout
but
is
definitely
a
userfriendly
stout
and
very
drinkable
it
comes
with
a
robust
flavor
but
isnt
a
big
boozy
carbohydrate
packed
stout
that
i
enjoy
very
much
i
respect
that
can
poured
into
glass
pours
black
with
tan
head
that
retains
nicely
the
nose
starts
with
some
fruity
notes
mainly
raisins
this
is
paired
with
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
creaminess
the
taste
is
fruit
forward
again
with
notes
of
raisin
dominating
this
gives
way
to
a
tangy
metallic
character
that
isnt
working
for
me
some
roast
appears
up
front
but
is
ultimately
drowned
out
by
fruit
and
metallic
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
for
style
with
appropriate
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
one
just
isnt
working
for
me
taste
silky
smooth
creamy
body
sweetness
up
front
coffee
unsweetened
chocolate
brown
malt
soft
charcoal
burnt
raisins
black
currants
faint
licorice
root
drying
sooty
finish
im
by
no
means
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
but
i
do
like
upslope
and
wanted
to
give
this
one
a
shot
i
think
its
a
solid
offering
and
would
get
it
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
i
released
it
with
a
mighty
crack
allowing
some
offgassing
of
co2
the
inverted
glug
would
have
made
guinness
envious
with
its
pseudocascading
action
i
dislike
when
i
hear
people
say
oh
i
dont
like
dark
beer
because
color
generally
has
little
to
do
with
it
but
cases
like
this
one
hearten
me
it
finally
settled
into
a
dense
cap
of
two
fingers
of
deeptan
head
that
sat
atop
the
beer
like
a
muffin
top
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
allowing
zero
light
penetration
nose
smelled
of
dark
chocolate
smoky
burnt
wood
dried
dark
fruit
charcoal
and
molasses
mouthfeel
was
medium
approaching
a
fullness
on
the
tongue
the
taste
was
initially
very
smoky
before
the
dark
chocolate
broke
through
lacing
had
already
begun
to
form
in
the
glass
the
finish
was
semisweet
quite
chocolaty
but
with
the
smokiness
lingering
after
the
swallow
hoo
hah
my
but
this
was
good
it
was
for
me
more
of
a
dessert
beer
than
something
that
i
would
put
into
my
cooler
i
am
glad
for
the
opportunity
to
have
tried
it
in
its
limited
release
othis
is
not
my
favorite
upslope
offering
as
noted
above
the
whole
package
is
a
bit
simple
and
the
taste
is
a
bit
metallic
and
hot
perhaps
this
is
the
true
export
style
because
i
think
some
time
in
a
cargo
hold
or
cellar
might
mellow
the
harsh
aspects
of
this
beer
upslopes
foreign
style
stout
does
a
reasonably
good
job
at
replicating
the
asserted
roast
character
thats
displayed
in
similar
version
such
as
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
but
it
is
a
little
softer
on
the
roast
than
is
expected
even
with
the
gentle
hand
it
makes
for
a
very
tasty
stout
that
will
appease
all
lovers
of
the
devoted
black
beers
thanks
again
to
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
some
coffee
taste
s
slightly
sweet
chocolate
roasted
malts
coffee
a
hint
of
hops
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
overall
this
was
a
solid
offering
and
example
of
an
overlooked
style
in
america
a
more
drinkable
and
flavorful
version
of
the
most
popular
example
in
the
world
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
and
its
in
a
can
so
i
approve
my
take
another
great
showing
by
upslope
i
would
love
to
try
this
beer
on
nitro
a
hardy
head
seems
important
to
the
conveyance
of
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
a
less
bready
accompaniment
to
this
beer
a
mild
cheese
bad
provolone
good
mozzarella
would
go
well
with
this
as
would
lowgarlic
hummus
o
overall
nice
export
stout
nothing
crazy
but
nice
representation
of
the
style
overall
just
not
fun
not
enough
taste
profiles
and
way
too
heavy
o
overall
this
was
an
average
or
so
beer
pretty
straightforward
execution
here
low
c
overall
a
nice
dry
stout
one
of
upslopes
better
beers
o
solid
not
excellent
but
id
drink
this
roasted
characteristics
are
everything
here
and
it
does
it
well
drink
fresh
most
likely
o
a
solid
stout
great
taste
and
aromas
but
lacking
in
the
appearance
and
mo
department
o
a
decent
stout
surprisingly
thin
for
6
9
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
black
with
a
thumbs
width
brown
head
that
quickly
dropped
to
s
a
slight
surface
coating
toasted
barley
some
chocolate
some
sweet
dark
fruits
and
a
little
bit
of
metal
flavor
is
strong
from
the
roasted
barley
a
sharp
sweetness
carries
through
it
a
little
dark
fruit
and
nutty
thinner
in
body
a
stout
but
it
works
creamy
mouthfeel
to
it
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
spectatular
id
happily
drink
it
again
but
probably
wont
be
seeking
this
out
on
my
own
again
this
is
the
first
upslope
that
i
did
not
particularly
enjoy
having
it
looks
the
part
smells
nice
but
all
down
hill
with
more
lactic
acid
astringency
and
overroasted
malt
very
little
coffee
or
chocolate
if
the
acidity
could
be
toned
down
i
would
enjoy
the
nuttiness
and
dark
fruit
a
bit
more
as
it
is
right
now
not
worth
seeking
out
can
from
denver
seems
to
be
in
great
condition
a
pleasant
quaff
and
stronger
than
it
tastes
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
and
easily
drinkable
stout
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
hop
head
that
loves
bitterness
even
though
it
doesnt
have
the
traditional
hop
bitterness
overall
this
was
a
decent
representation
of
a
foreign
stout
i
prefer
lion
stout
more
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
one
anytime
soon
o
not
anything
close
to
what
i
wanted
i
love
the
can
but
could
give
or
take
the
beer
i
know
upslope
is
capable
of
better
so
cmon
guys
put
on
those
thinking
caps
and
blow
me
away
with
your
next
brew
perhaps
it
should
be
your
famous
belgian
o
pretty
good
stuff
im
glad
ive
got
5
more
cans
of
this
to
dive
into
not
something
to
brag
endlessly
about
but
a
pretty
solid
export
stout
d
its
an
average
stout
at
best
the
flavors
are
just
too
muted
and
simple
good
stout
not
amazing
pours
a
nice
heavy
dark
roast
color
with
a
good
creamy
almost
nitro
looking
off
white
head
smells
a
little
more
candylike
than
a
lot
of
stouts
but
the
flavor
isnt
too
sweet
just
in
the
nose
also
some
almost
burnt
barley
type
smells
and
some
definite
alcohol
flavor
is
burnt
too
but
a
nice
bitter
burnt
vibe
hop
bitter
too
which
is
nice
here
also
plenty
of
mellow
flavors
vanilla
somewhere
dark
chocolate
too
mouthfeel
is
in
harmony
with
the
rest
of
whats
going
on
full
bodied
but
drinkable
nice
bitterish
finish
the
thing
that
throws
me
though
is
a
rubbing
alcohol
kind
of
flavor
at
the
end
really
makes
the
mouthfeel
kind
of
tart
just
a
little
off
at
the
end
but
aside
form
that
a
nice
milky
thick
strong
sessionable
stout
there
is
not
a
bad
upslope
beer
but
they
all
have
that
kind
of
finish
not
sure
if
its
the
can
or
what
i
love
snowmelt
as
the
primary
ingredient
in
each
of
their
brews
overall
i
came
away
mixed
this
particular
can
is
working
for
me
but
the
others
werent
perhaps
a

here
still
its
a
nice
little
beer
that
im
glad
i
tried
overall
a
good
beer
for
me
good
flavors
without
going
over
the
top
no
signs
of
abv
good
drinkability
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
for
10
49
despite
my
better
judgement
but
i
really
liked
their
brown
ale
dark
black
color
witha
scant
set
of
bubbles
uh
oh
smells
like
roasted
malt
stout
not
bad
but
kind
of
average
the
taste
was
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
that
really
made
me
want
to
reach
for
another
one
i
think
the
big
problem
with
this
is
that
all
of
my
cans
seemed
pretty
flat
and
it
was
not
reminiscent
of
cask
beer
if
that
is
what
they
were
going
for
disappointing
an
excellent
canned
stout
try
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
which
makes
this
6

beer
highly
drinkable
and
pretty
sessionable

i
know
this
beer
is
selling
like
hotcakes
in
the
denver
area
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
is
a
very
solid
and
drinkable
beer
the
low
carbonation
is
definitely
something
that
could
be
improved
upon
but
if
they
can
fix
that
its
a
pretty
admirable
take
on
an
export
stout
o
a
decent
stout
not
roasty
enough
and
too
flat
in
my
opinion
had
this
one
on
tap
the
other
night
at
the
vine
street
pub
in
denver
as
part
of
the
stout
month
celebration
needed
a
beer
to
fill
out
a
taster
set
and
chose
this
one
black
with
a
decent
head
aromas
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
malted
milk
medium

very
roasty
with

flavors
on
the

there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
below
average
beer
that
is
definitely
suffering
from
a
mild
infection
but
is
still
fairly
drinkable
as
it
is
i
paid
only
6
99
for
this
magnum
which
struck
me
as
a
very
good
deal
i
had
not
seen
this
brand
in
my
town
before
and
am
encouraged
by
the
increasing
variety
of
craft
beer
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
medium
bodied
to
start
but
finishing
somewhat
fuller
warming
almost
from
the
start
finish
is
dryish
a
really
nice
brew
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
good
the
beer
is
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
thick
beige
cap
which
coats
the
glass
with
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
brings
a
myriad
of
fruits
to
include
apples
grapes
dark
malt
and
toffee
notes
pretty
sweet
with
prominent
belgian
yeast
and
caramel
tones
definitely
some
plum
fig
raisin
character
in
this
one
sweet
apples
soaked
in
alcohol
pretty
good
it
was
reddish
in
color
but
its
appearance
made
you
wonder
what
it
tastes
like
this
doesnt
taste
anything
like
a
stout
more
like
a
wine
im
not
saying
that
the
taste
was
bad
it
tastes
nice
just
very
different
it
would
be
a
good
choice
to
recommend
to
wine
drinkers
who
want
to
know
what

a
melding
of

a
drier
foreign

stout
leaning
a
bit
more
in
the
belgian

direction
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
either
and
a
good
job
at
combining
the
strengths
of
both
the
slight
sourness
was
a
bit
distracting
for
me
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
the
mild

made

look

a
sipper
im
very
willing
to
be
more
patient
with
this
brewery
to
see
if
they
develope
this
brew
even
more
in
the
upcoming
years
esters
and
alcohol
sweet
berries
are
present
in
the
nose
but
also
a
powerful
touch
of
coffee
caramel
and
mocha
extremely
pleasant
the
taste
is
spicy
but
spicy
but
it
is
also
sweet
and
caramelized
this
a
very
good
way
a
finish
a
little
bitter
but
with
a
persistent
spicy
on
the
tongue
plus
a
coffee
liqueur
reminiscent
of
an
italian
espresso
lots
of
flavors
in
the
nose
and
mouth
d
one
or
two
is
okay
but
i
do
not
think
that
more
than
that
would
work
m
d
creamy
soft
edged
mediumheavy
weight
and
quite
drinkable
with
the
abv
unapparent
the
co2
was
making
for
wellintegrated
drinking
for
such
a
gusher
t
overall
different
and
worth
a
try
d
this
is
very
good
and
id
certainly
seek
it
out
again
im
a
bit
puzzled
by
the
stout
label
as
its
not
normally
what
id
expect
from
a
stout
lots
of
flavor
would
go
well
with
a
hearty
stew
or
by
itself
on
pleasant
outdoor
evening
on
the
patio
d
very
enjoyable
i
loved
it
and
would
recommend
it
to
any
none
dark
beer
drinker
as
a
nice
starting
point
picked
up
a
single
from
abes
cold
beer
for
4
and
poured
it
into
a
tumbler
it
opens
with
a
big
raisin
aroma
the
flavor
follows
the
dried
fruit
character
with
bready
cocoa
notes
that
remind
me
of
an
english
brown
ale
oddly
enough
this
beer
seems
a
lot
like
an
imperial
english
brown
ale
if
such
a
thing
existed
the
body
is
relatively
drinkable
and
theres
a
mix
of
dark
barley
flavors
with
complimentary
fruit
overall
a
wellmade
and
interesting
beglian
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
is
unbelievably
smooth
and
ive
never
tasted
a
beer
like
it
it
keeps
me
coming
back
drink
after
drink
d
overall
this
beer
seems
like
an
almost
perfect
mix
of
a
great
belgian
strong
dark
ale
and
a
nice
british
stout
could
be
a
bit
more
tart
could
have
a
bit
more
complexity
but
overall
very
nice
drinkability
was
good
for
an
8
50
abv
flavor
was
up
there
but
it
was
a
bit
pricey
for
a
go
to
beer
tart
bitter
but
also
somewhat
creamy
in
texture
obscura
indeed
lives
up
to
its
name
its
a
highly
unusual
stout
one
of
the
most
unique
ive
ever
had
it
isnt
one
thats
easy
to
belt
back
by
any
means
but
its
overall
quite
good
and
challenging
fine
stuff
note
flavor
and
aroma
is
much
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
alcohol
is
still
well
blended
into
the
beer
hv
future
outlook
i
feel
fairly
confident
that
i
got
an
off
bottle
and
i
might
give
this
another
shot
if
it
strikes
my
fancy
decent
but
quite
a
bit
more
syrupy
sweet
than
i
prefer
drinks
very
solid
for
a
beer
of
such
strength
not
often
do
i
come
across
a
belgian
stout

this

fantastic

very

just
as
mentioned
in
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
bit
tart
in
addition
to
everything
else
going
on
that
i
mentioned
earlier
in
this
review
drinkability
is
average
all
in
all
this
beer
is
worth
your
time
at
least
on
a
couple
occasions

and
a

mouthfeel
is
soft

and
just
the
right
carbonation
very
drinkable
with
no

of

a

that
is
somehow
satisfying
and
thirstinducing
all
at

its
the
perpetual

of
beers
and
again
and
again

again
d
pretty
smooth

easy

for

a
very
interesting
offering
worth
a
try
by
far
a
unique
beer
worth
trying
no
matter
your
tastes
quite
spritzylots
of
carbonation
which
is
balanced
by
the
oily
thick
body
the
flavor
profile
has
raisin
toffee
and
alcohol
nice
bitter
finish
that
seems
to
be
a
pleasant
blend
of
hop
and
black
patent
as
it
says
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
mild
stout
but
it
retains
its
belgian
heritage
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
enjoy
the
style
and
will
add
more
to
my
collection
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
firm
beige
head
the
aroma
is
medium
sweet
with
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
as
some
earthy
hops
the
flavor
is
roasted
and
malty
with
coffee
chocolate
caramel
and
raisins
more
bitter
toward
the
finish
i
must
admit
belgian
stouts
have
been
growing
on
me
lately
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
its
solid
and
well
made
in
any
case
this
is
a
complex
interesting
beer
just
dont
let
the
name
fool
you
the
flavor
is
generally
sweet
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
with
a
little
bit
of
doughy
yeast
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
and
roasty
actually
but
also
just
a
hint
of
an
off
metallic
flavor
way
in
the
background
overall
the
beer
is
tasty
but
i
wonder
about
geyser
beers
and
their
status
id
like
to
try
this
one
again
methinks
d
great
for
sipping
its
complex
enough
to
be
belgian
yet
has
an
overall
english
quality
to
it
excellent
balance
of
the
two
drinkability
good
d
like
i
said
the
flavors
are
strong
but
dont
present
themselves
well
at
all
i
got
tired
of
the
taste
and
heavy
body
of
this
beer
so
i
couldnt
see
myself
having
another
or
buying
this
ever
again

interesting
belgian
take
on
a
stout
this
belgian
stout
i
split
with
my
friend
john
while
sleeping
on
his
couch
because
my
gf
had
kicked
me
out
of
the
house
if
it
seems
like
a
did
a
lot
of
reviews
while
in
that
painful
relationship
its
because
i
did
out
of
the
bottle
the
beer
was
a
cloudy
dark
mahogany
color
huge
three
finger
head
of
mochalike
foam
that
retained
beautifully
and
left
curtains
of
sticky
lacing
on
our
glasses
the
aroma
was
clearly
belgian
complex
fruity
esters
roasted
malt
and
coffee
the
flavor
profile
was
similar
starting
sweet
with
chocolate
then
going
into
the
fruit
and
tangy
yeast
before
swinging
to
the
bitter
end
for
an
acidic
coffee
finish
complex
and
distinctly
european
i
prefer
american
stouts
personally
but
if
you
dig
the
over
the
pond
kind
you
must
try
it
very
solid
brew
a
good
beer
but
not
great
ive
had
several
belgian
stouts
now
and
i
have
strongly
disappointed
by
each
one
clearly
not
my
style
drinkability
is
great
tons
of
flavor
smooth
going
down
and
always
leaves
you
craving
the
next
sip
troubadour
obscuras
a
very
impressive
beer
i
didnt
quite
know
what
to
expect
from
this
one
color
me
very
surprised
and
impressed
its
packed
full
of
flavor
and
is
very
complex
yet
its
an
approachable
and
very
drinkable
beer
i
think
it
could
stand
a
little
more
body
and
a
little
work
on
the
nose
but
its
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
definitely
one
to
check
out
highly
drinkable
very
enjoyable
dthis
is
not
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
it
lacks
the
spice
character
and
even
the
bottle
says
mild
stout
also
the
abv
is
incorrect
8
2
on
bottle
the
alcohol
is
somewhat
masked
you
can
tell
its
strong
but
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
a
session
brew
but
still
a
great
beer
from
belgium
d
very
impressed
poured
into
chalice
nice
thick
offwhite
head
rich
mahogany
in
color
and
good
retention
and
lacing
a
very
nice
looking
beer
smell
complex
with
notes
of
sweet
milk
chocolate
some
alcohol
caramel
and
dark
fruits
as
it
warmed
it
almost
took
on
a
red
wine
like
smell
taste
was
good
but
a
little
too
boozy
for
me
some
chocolate
dark
fruits
cherries
or
grapes
it
seemed
like
a
bit
of
coffee
and
a
little
too
much
alcohol
i
also
notice
a
slight
metallic
taste
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
smooth
very
warming
as
it
goes
down
overall
a
great
beer
i
dont
know
if
the
metallic
taste
was
just
a
bad
bottle
or
not
but
even
with
that
it
proved
to
be
a
solid
belgian
drinkability
is
solid
here
i
believe
after
some
aging
this
will
develop
more
of
a
stout
character
similar
to
allagash
black
but
with
more
polish
the
carbonation
isnt
desirable
to
me
but
otherwise
its
a
nice
belgian
take
on
a
stout
d
this
is
good
for
a
mild
stout
i
love
stouts
they
are
my
favorite
style
but
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
mild
style
stout
another
fun
belgian
stout
pretty
thin
mouthfeel
i
really
like
the
drinkablilty
of
these
beers
despite
the
higher
abv
they
hide
them
fairly
well
and
this
one
was
very
refreshing
i
think
i
drank
it
in
about
minutes
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
one
finger
off
white
head
on
a
semi
aggressive
pour
smell
is
belgian
yeasts
sweet
tangy
some
sweet
rich
malts
in
the
back
taste
is
a
little
smokey
on
the
back
sweet
malts
up
front
low
carbonation
slick
on
the
tongue
a
pretty
easy
drink
troubadour
blond
ale
is
good
stuff
troubadour
obscura
mild
stout
is
even
better
i
saw
4packs
up
in
madison
several
days
ago
new
label
and
didnt
buy
one
now
that
ive
tasted
what
this
exceptional
ale
has
to
offer
i
wont
make
that
mistake
again
this
is
fantastic
i
could
sip
it
all
night
worth
a
shot
the
more
i
try
this
style
the
more
i
like
its
uniqueness
this
is
a
great
breakfast
or
dessert
beer
i
enjoyed
this
completly
and
will
purse
more
of
this
d
fantastic
worth
seeking
out
will
definitely
enjoy
again
if
i
ever
find
it
again
drinkability
goes
down

is
hidden
very
well
out
of
a
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
an
average
head
that
dissipated
into
a
sparse
cap
the
smell
is
of
dark
fruit
figs
candi
sugar
and
hints
of
milk
chocolate
the
taste
is
definitely
of
stout
big
roasted
malt
and
dark
bitter
chocolate
the
belgian
spice
and
sweetness
are
subdued
by
the
roasted
malt
the
feel
is
moderate
with
active
carbonation
and
finishes
bitter
from
the
malt
the
characteristics
of
a
stout
stand
out
in
this
brew
as
it
warms
you
can
start
to
detect
some
of
the
spice
and
other
belgian
characteristics
a
good
overall
beer
very
solid
this
is
a
great
brew
not
exactly
what
i
expected
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
certainly
be
trying
it
again
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
carbonated
drinkability
probably
not
that
close
to
style
but
i
find
this
to
be
one
of
the
most
pleasurable
belgian
darks
ive
had
overall
an
intriguing
combination
of
flavors
in
a
rather
light
bodied
example
of
the
style
nothing
outstanding
about
this
brew
but
technically
flawless
nonetheless
and
a
fantastic
ale
on
a
cold
january
new
york
evening
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
brown
no
head
nose
is
mild
malts
flavor
is
smooth
but
with
a
slight
popping
edge
to
it
mild
malts
mixed
with
yeasts
firm
sweetness
i
have
had
this
on
the
bottle
before
and
still
stand
by
what
my
memory
serves
about
my
previous
review
this
is
like
a
mild
stout
mixed
with
a
dark
belgian
ale
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
on
the
liquid
and
with
a
great
amount
of
bubble
on
the
tongue
highly
drinkable
easily
sessionable
smooth
and
so
well
crafted
as
for
the
flavor
oh
my
i
was
utterly
unprepared
for
the
bitter
onslaught
of
coffee
chocolate
raisins
and
dark
rum
puckered
the
sides
of
the
mouth
while
a
peppery
spice
and
a
solid
warming
alcohol
note
washed
over
the
entire
palate
the
body
was
of
medium
consistency
slightly
overcarbonaed
and
finished
a
bit
chalky
down
the
gullet
troubadours
mild
stout
wasnt
mild
at
all
rather
its
intricate
aroma
flavor
and
bitterness
made
for
an
interesting
brew
that
i
would
certainly
go
after
again
overall
a
tasty
stout
very
unique
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
color
with
a
creamy
milky
one
inch
head
in
a
tulip
glass
smell
is
similar
to
a
belgian
more
so
than
a
stout
lots
of
sugary
yeasty
and
dried
fruit
tones
taste
is
coffee
and
chocolate
at
first
followed
by
some
dry
fruit
sweetness
mouthfeeling
is
nice
and
creamy
as
well
not
a
stout
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
dark
murky
brown
nose
of
fruit
malts
and
sugar
tasted
like
one
of
or
a
combination
of
a
a
belgian
dubbel
b
an
aged
and
oxidized
american
barleywine
c
a
limp
weizenbock
so
not
impressed
i
did
not
finish
it
and
had
the
bartender
take
it
back
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
am
judging
it
according
to
its
professed
style
if
a
friend
had
homebrewed
this
as
a
belgian
dubbel
then
i
would
have
been
impressed
tastemouthfeel
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
forefront
very
roasty
but
with
an
underlying
fruity
character
that
isnt
common
amongst
stouts
has
a
subtle
tartness
that
is
also
present
in
de
dolles
extra
export
stout
creamy
on
the
tongue
its
quite
thick
and
chewy
extremely
smooth
with
no
hint
of
alcohol
pretty
unique
stuff
and
very
good

pours
black
with
amber
hints
and
a
tan

aroma
of
a
belgiany
sweet
roasted

in
the
taste
a
sweet
roasty

a
smooth
big
body
mouthfeel
and
a
sweet
malty
aftertaste
nice
and
smooth
nice
body
more
porterish
than
a
stout
but
still
tasty
and
quite
different
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
although
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
certainly
worth
a
try
if
for
no
other
reason
than
it
is
quite
a
unique
brew
mild
stout
huh
im
not
sure
i
can
get
my
arms
around
that
but
it
is
a
very
stately
complex
and
blended
belgian
with
plenty
of
guts
and
finesses
each
in
turn
it
stood
up
to
and
wonderfully
complimented
a
fine
italian
blue
cheese
blu
del
moncenisio
even
as
a
standalone
it
is
utterly
enjoyable
if
at
times
a
bit
too
big
for
its
own
good
maybe
blurring
some
edges
in
spots
the
abv
is
spookily
disguised
lurking
and
waiting
for
ones
foolish
overindulgence
and
yet
it
goes
down
well
clean
in
the
end
and
refreshing
especially
with
the
right
gustatorial
pairing
so
call
it
what
you
will
its
a
pleasure
mouth
is
creamy
and
thick
drinkability
is
better
than
i
thought
and
will
try
this
one
again
very
drinkable
brew
most
enjoyable
overall
very
nice
a
good
belgian
to
keep
in
the
cellar
or
to
enjoy
whenever
you
want
a
bsda
with
more
character
pors
a
deep
ruby
red
color
nearly
black
until
held
in
the
light
topped
off
with
a
tall
frothy
head
of
light
tan
foam
that
leaves
streaks
of
lacing
in
the
tulip
glass
the
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
mollasses
raisins
and
dates
very
warm
and
very
rich
the
palate
reminds
me
in
some
small
way
of
achel
brune
but
slightly
more
biting
this
is
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
not
a
stout
at
least
in
the
traditional
sense
of
the
word
dark
roasted
malt
figs
raisins
and
more
blackstrap
mollasses
in
the
palate
the
8
5
alcohol
is
quite
well
hidden
but
does
provide
a
nice
warm
finish
speaking
of
finish
this
ale
is
not
cloying
but
does
have
a
lingering
sweetness
aggressively
carbonated
it
leaves
fairly
clean
and
dry
however
thich
in
the
mouth
but
alive
with
carbonation
this
is
an
intriguing
beer
very
rich
and
complex
a
pleasant
belgian
strong
dark
ale
in
every
respect
id
say
if
i
had
another
bottle
id
want
to
cellar
it
for
a
year
or
two
and
see
how
the
flavors
and
mouthfeel
round
out
still
very
nice
as
it
is
now
cant
exactly
say
drinking
this
beer
is
a
chore
in
fact
it
is
quite
good
definitely
one
of
those
freestyle
belgian
ales
that
succeeds
the
brewmaster
has
taken
ideas
from
many
different
beer
styles
and
countries
and
melded
them
into
something
of
a
belgian
take
on
the
sweet
stout
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
wee
heavy
to
me
recommended
for
those
who
dont
care
too
much
about
definitions
and
strict
interpretations
of
beer
styles
d
a
very
enjoyable
strong
dark
ale
that
hides
it
alcohol
well
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
dunique
effort
here
not
sure
if
this
is
a
stout
or
a
belgian
strong
ale
tastes
like
a
blend
worth
trying
for
the
sake
of
trying
something
a
little
different
one
is
enough
for
me
though
this
beer
is
so
easy
to
drink
you
could
hurt
yourself
if
you
werent
careful
ill
definitely
be
ordering
this
one
again
and
next
time
it
wont
be
by
accident
final
note
this
is
a
beer
to
savor
and
enjoylet
your
taste
buds
experience
every
ounce
of
flavor
d
pretty
drinkable
besides
the
strong
alcohol
flavor
but
hey
this
is
beer
i
would
definitely
try
again
next
winter
yum
i
say
again
dessert
beer
for
sure
i
had
this
at
romans
pub
in
milwaukee
served
as
always
in
appropriate
glassware
a
unibroue
tulip
if
i
remember
correctly
appearance
was
black
with
some
red
legs
as
the
light
shone
through
it
d
this
beer
has
a
nice
dark
malt
flavor
and
some
nice
wild
yeast
characteristics
this
is
a
creative
beer
that
shows
fusion
done
right
can
really
make
a
good
beer
drinkability
is
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
combination
the
high
carbonation
is
the
biggest
flaw
to
me
and
even
that
isnt
too
bad
a
great
marriage
of
stout
and
belgian
just
give
it
a
good
swirl
to
loose
some
carbonation
and
its
great
not
what
it
was
presented
as
but
a
good
beer
nonethless
foist
off
dont
know
the
status
of
this
brewery
bodega
used
to
get
troubadour
amber
with
the
other
label
of
the
happy
guy
anyway
this
was
served
with
a
light
head
and
some
lace
mahogany
color
very
aromatic
malty
character
flavors
the
same
but
more
intense
a
little
booziness
and
an
odd
bit
of
peatiness
like
a
misplaced
scotch
ale
delicious
boozyness
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
but
dry
not
bad
at
all
delicious
and
refreshing
and
absolutely
no
sign
of
alcohol
or
high
gravity
sweet
and
sticky
yet
not
thick
or
viscous
milk
chocolate
malt
carmel

great
light
mouthfeel
perfect

water
backbone
great
drinking
its
absolutely
delicious
and
perhaps
the
most
unintimidating
stout
to
convert
your
fellow
beer
drinkers
cheers
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
strong
darks
id
absolutely
love
to
see
this
in
the
states
highly
recommended
this
folks
is
tasty
put
it
this
way
ive
had
quite
a
few
brews
so
it
takes
something
special
for
me
to
really
notice
it
i
noticed
this
one
drinkability
flavors
meld
excellent
together
very
well
rounded
per
style
and
in
every
category
wonderful
stout
that
i
highly
recommend
overall
a
tasty
belgian
style
ale
that
gets
lost
in
the
shuffle
amongst
the
greats
worthy
of
me
drinking
again
for
sure
recommended
im
not
a
very
good
label
reader
i
had
not
idea
this
was
a
stout
anyway
it
poured
a
dark
chocolate
thinge
with
a
poofy
head
the
aroma
is
much
stronger
than
a
mild
stout
thats
for
sure
stiffly
alcoholic
likewise
as
i
sip
on
this
while
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
its
a
strong
one
and
would
take
the
weekend
stoutie
by
surprise
strong
bitter
dark
cherry
alcohol
dark
plum
and
an
obscenely
sweet
twist
at
the
end

the
bottle
cap
of
this
bottle
indicates
that
it
is
best
before
82308
and
was
consumed
on
22507
i
poured
it
into
a
chimay
glass
the
head
falls
quickly
on
this
beer
and
leaves
just
the
dark
brown
body
the
center
of
the
beer
blocks
light
but
a
large
amount
for
a
stout
does
get
through
at
the
edges
exposing
a
lighter
brown
hue
the
aroma
is
more
typical
of
a
dark
belgian
beer
than
a
mild
stout
as
it
is
labeled
it
has
a
pretty
strong
malty
presence
but
there
is
some
roasted
aroma
in
there
as
well
there
is
also
a
weird
smell
in
there
that
reminds
me
of
green
or
purple
olives
but
it
is
pretty
faint
the
first
thing
i
notice
as
i
taste
it
is
the
creaminess
it
is
the
typical
creaminess
that
i
find
in
dark
belgians
the
primary
flavor
is
the
roasted
malt
and
it
is
good
for
a
stout
this
is
an
excellent
combination
of
a
dark
belgian
and
a
stout
the
beer
just
does
not
do
it
for
me
it
tastes
a
bit
too
much
like
fermented
prune
juice
to
really
be
all
that
palatable
it
never
reaches
horrible
and
i
could
easily
drink
this
if
politeness
demanded
it
fortunately
it
does
not
so
i
will
not
a
great
beer
which
looks
like
westmalle
dubbel
but
then
even
better
drinkability
an
exciting
stout
the
apple
notes
really
balance
with
the
bitter
chocolate
to
make
this
incredibly
drinkable
and
distinct
i
definitely
plan
on
getting
more
of
these
the
body
is
fairly
light
and
dry
on
the
palate
a
bit
peppery
carbonation
is
mild
providing
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
interesting
and
unique
brew
for
sure
it
tastes
like
a
stout
but
it
is
distinctly
belgian
as
well
just
not
clean
enough
to
be
too
drinkable
and
it
seems
to
be
all
over
the
board
im
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
however
drinkability
balanced
cheers
i
was
curious
about
a
belgian
stout
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
i
could
see
this
as
a
breakfast
beer
with
a
nice
brunch
but
it
will
pack
a
punch
with
8
5
alcohol
i
liked
it
and
will
get
more
and
drink
them
one
at
a
time
drinkability
worth
a
shot
its
a
a
great
combination
of
two
great
styles
pours
very
dark
brown
with
half
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
leaving
thin
lace
toasted
coffee
and
powdered
chocolate
malts
in
the
nose
with
an
undercurrent
of
dark
fruit
plums
raisins
simple
yet
satisfying
flavor
chewy
grains
up
front
develops
nice
toasted
bread
and
powdered
cocoa
in
the
center
a
touch
of
drying
hops
and
warming
fruity
alcohol
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
is
well
integrated
overall
medium
to
heavy
in
the
mouth
balanced
more
towards
carbonation
than
creaminess
satisfying
though
not
particularly
easydrinking
due
to
the
strength
and
body
what
an
interesting
beer
disguises
its
high
alcohol
content
completely
very
smoothdrinking
mediumbodied
beer
with
a
great
deal
of
subtley
has
some
of
the
rich
malty
stout
taste
with
hints
of
chocolate
but
ends
up
being
dominated
by
the
spicy
belgian
dark
ale
taste
with
some
hints
of
prune
or
plum
seems
like
an
effective
blending
of
the
two
styles
very
much
worth
returning
to
pours
a
beautiful
deep
ruddy
brown
with
a
nice
sitting
and
lasting
tan
head
atop
aroma
is
of
hot
chocolate
powder
and
slight
roastiness
semisweet
flavor
follows
through
but
is
much
less
sweet
dark
heavy
fruits
cherries
plums
a
bit
of
apricot
remind
me
that
this
isnt
really
a
stout
but
is
a
belgian
dark
ale
the
body
is
rich
and
filling
with
more
carbonation
than
expected
for
a
stoutbsda
a
very
tasty
brew
not
in
the
class
of
some
of
the
best
bsda
around
but
very
tasty
indeed
sampled
at
the
odds

before

on

d
surprised
this
beer
doesnt
get
better
ratings
than
it
does
i
find
it
quite
amusing
and
really
like
it
when
belgian
beers
keep
with
their
roots
but
stray
to
other
styles
outside
their
borders
while
not
knocking
my
socks
off
this
is
a
pleasant
tasting
belgian
ale
that
wont
disappoint
unless
youre
looking
first
and
foremost
for
a
stout
it
goes
down
easily
enough
giving
little
notice
of
its
8
5
abv
the
price
will
probably
not
have
me
returning
to
this
anytime
soon
however
as
there
are
enough
dark
belgians
around
that
are
cheaper
and
just
as
good
if
not
better
certainly
the
st
bernardus
abt
12
i
bought
at
the
same
place
for
a
slightly
cheaper
price
has
no
fear
of
being
passed
over
next
time
in
favor
of
this
beer
mouth
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
the
strong
carbonation
hitting
the
front
of
the
mouth
and
continuing
all
the
way
through
the
beer
tastes
predominantly
of
malts
starting
smooth
and
finishing
even
stronger
it
carries
a
touch
of
sourness
that
i
normally
dont
like
in
my
dark
beers
but
this
one
was
not
harsh
enough
to
scare
me
away
and
actually
added
some
character
some
black
pepper
taste
and
a
warm
alcohol
exhale
picked
up
a
minigrowler
and
an
11
2
ounce
bottle
best
before
dating

on
the
capof
this
brew
half
time
this
afternoon
both
versions
pour
a
nice
warm

shade

amber
the
bottled
version
seems
to
be
much
more
highly
carbonated
dark
tan
head
better
retention
on
the
bottled
sample
and
similar
spotty

left
behind

the

too
strong
on

for

first
sip
at
ballast
point
miramar
brewery
february
2015
with
john
mom
and
dad
overall
nice
heat
with
the
sweet
combining
for
an
odd
unique
and
mostly
pleasant
drinking
experience
everything
the
rogue
sriracha
hot
stout
should
have
been
but
wasnt
novel
concept
well
executed
surprised
to
be
in
the
minority
on
this
one
well
i
cant
be
expected
to
know
everything
it
is
what
is
advertised
curry
up
front
coconut
after
taste
and
cayenne
just
burning
the
back
of
your
tongue
it
delivers
as
advertised
and
is
respectable
but
not
what
i
enjoy
out
of
a
stout
i
like
this
idea
of
a
masala
spiced
beer
but
this
one
is
not
it
ballast
point
usually
a
huge
fan
but
you
owe
me
a
seamonster
after
this
one
i
love
indian
food
this
is
avery
underrated
beer
from
an
indian
food
lover
perspective
bring
that
dish
level
10
spicy
all
day
with
this
to
pair
it
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
awesome
beer
but
judging
by
the
other
reviews
im
in
the
minority
to
me
this
tastes
like
what
all
those
christmas
stouts
brewed
with
spices
are
supposed
to
taste
like
with
the
uniqueness
of
the
indian
spices
really
making
it
stand
out
above
the
other
spice
brewed
stouts
but
it
is
good
and
i
bet
it
goes
really
well
with
may
ethnic
foods
i
was
drawn
in
by
all
the
bizarre
additives
but
should
have
known
better
the
smell
is
all
curry
and
cumin
taste
is
much
the
same
but
the
cayenne
heat
is
present
as
well
not
much
stout
flavor
just
lots
of
spice
overall
a
regrettable
purchase
so
i
guess
this
was
interesting
like
drinking
a
bottle
of
curry
mixed
with
stout
i
mean
this
clearly
wasnt
made
for
beer
drinkers
but
for
people
who
are
just
generally
adventurous
with
their
palates
go
ahead
and
try
it
its
definitely
different
but
i
hesitate
to
even
call
it
beer
and
if
youre
a
beer
drinker
looking
for
a
delicious
beer
this
aint
it
the
hints
of
spice
and
coconuts
quickly
hit
the
noise
the
bite
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
throat
the
blend
of
spice
was
intoxicating
combined
it
with
an
ancho
chili
creme
brulee
for
an
amazing
dessert
liked
this
a
lot
the
spices
are
very
well
blended
and
complex
i
would
love
this
spicing
in
an
imperial
stout
im
not
sure
this
style
supports
all
the
spices
that
well
although
the
thinner
feel
might
be
better
with
a
meal
pleasant
stout
with
better
thne
moderate
spicing
going
on
moderate
heat
that
glows
on
the
tongue
for
a
good
long
while
also
more
cumin
and
curryindian
spicing
tasty
complex
interesting
and
quite
worthy
stout
a
natural
pairing
for
some
bbq
or
indian
food
id
definitely
buy
this
one
again
it
smells
great
but
the
curry
taste
is
just
too
overwhelming
for
me
i
like
indian
food
i
like
stouts
so
i
thought
id
like
a
curry
stout
i
was
wrong
interesting
experience
the
curry
stays
in
the
back
and
warms
the
stomach
and
the
back
of
the
throat
chocolate
and
coconut
forward
in
flavor
with
the
spiciness
of
the
curry
taking
the
backseat
and
lingering
on
the
finish
nose
starts
like
a
brown
ale
with
hints
of
cayenne
spiciness
with
chocolate
notes
in
the
back
glad
i
got
to
try
it
some
of
the
reviews
on
here
are
completely
mislead
and
must
be
trolling
not
abrasive
at
all
in
flavor
or
smell
in
spite
of
the
ingredients
loved
it
too
much
madras
for
me
but
very
interesting
would
love
to
have
more
coconut
and
kaffir
come
out
in
this
tastessmells
like
coconut
thai
curry
a
bit
spicy
interesting
but
not
at
all
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
the
first
sip
was
a
bit
jarring
but
mellowed
out
as
i
became
acclimated
overspiced
for
my
taste
sorry
bp
your
ipa
offerings
are
in
my
top
5
o
overwhelmingly
spicy
for
me
i
appreciate
what
they
did
and
its
a
wellmade
beer
but
im
having
trouble
getting
through
it
its
just
a
bit
too
much
it
smells
and
tastes
like
authentic
indian
curry
its
amazing
a
bold
yet
welldone
beer
worth
a
try
unless
you
are
shy
at
heart
pleasant
spiciness
that
builds
over
time
interesting
beer
with
interesting
flavor
combinations
but
hard
to
finish
a
full
one
overall
definitely
not
for
everybody
definitely
not
for
most
occasions
however
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
it
and
that
says
something
ballast
point
really
created
a
stout
that
is
in
a
league
of
its
own
being
that
its
a
limited
release
if
you
see
it
and
you
love
the
beer
adventure
try
it
somehow
they
pull
it
off
though
and
it
becomes
an
intriguing
and
powerful
sip
weird
beer
but
good
doesnt
drink
well
with
any
food
u
gotta
love
spice
and
curry
for
this
one
glad
i
do
unique
beer
with
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
spice
flavor
reminds
me
that
i
need
to
make
curry
with
coconut
milk
again
a
bit
overwhelming
in
flavor
near
the
end
but
the
spices
make
me
feel
so
good
i
cant
stop
one
of
the
weirdest
most
disgusting
beers
ive
ever
had
drain
pour
you
can
really
taste
the
curry
would
great
with
indian
food
glass
snifter
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
again
only
if
you
like
indian
curry
i
like
it
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
weirdest
beer
ive
had
yet
glad
i
tried
it
once
dont
know
if
i
can
finish
the
bomber
i
do
wish
i
would
have
split
it
with
a
couple
of
other
adventurous
peeps
an
experience
for
sure
my
tummy
hurts
no
regrats
love
this
beer
to
this
day
this
is
the
only
beer
i
have
drank
and
threw
up
as
the
first
beer
of
the
night
because
i
drank
it
too
fast
like
an
idiot
be
forewarned
this
is
a
true
sipping
beer
to
be
drank
with
food
it
is
spicy
and
complex
keep
that
in
mind
and
you
will
get
along
great
with
this
oneofakind
brew
this
is
a
curry
stout
if
that
thought
disgusts
you
you
probably
shouldnt
buy
drink
or
rate
this
beer
i
couldnt
imagine
having
this
without
food
to
stand
up
to
it
but
it
went
well
with
pulled
pork
its
hard
to
imagine
a
better
take
on
a
curry
stout
trust
your
instincts
on
this
one
if
you
think
you
might
hate
it
youll
probably
hate
it
if
a
curry
stout
is
in
your
comfort
zone
check
it
out
who
would
have
thought
this
beer
is
fantastically
done
very
impressed
really
damn
hot
grab
a
glass
of
delirium
to
go
with
now
im
digging
the
initial
curry
aroma
and
after
a
sipwow
peppery
high
octane
curry
heat
this
most
definitely
is
a
love
ithate
it
type
of
beer
personally
i
love
chile
beers
and
spicy
foods
so
this
is
right
up
my
alley
theres
nothing
subtle
about
this
beast
yet
its
entirely
approachable
if
you
enjoy
a
good
spicy
heatgenerating
beverage
unique
and
approachable
for
those
with
an
openmind
i
grabbed
it
off
the
shelf
because
it
sounds
crazy
and
was
something
i
was
glad
to
try
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
a
very
complex
and
delicious
beer
definitely
nailed
what
they
were
going
for
lots
of
curry
indian
spices
on
the
nose
and
palate
i
should
have
read
reviews
before
buying
this
im
clearly
in
the
group
of
people
who
shouldnt
have
bought
this
maybe
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
its
not
a
concoction
ill
ever
have
again
straight
curry
in
my
opinion
thanks
to
a
forgotten
ba
for
sending
this
my
way
as
someone
who
loves
big
and
complex
flavor
this
beer
is
unrivaled
i
typically
gravitate
toward
hardhitting
aggressively
citrusy
ipas
but
i
have
never
been
as
wowed
by
a
beer
as
i
was
by
the
indra
kunindra
1010
would
beer
again
i
was
told
a
year
on
the
shelf
gives
this
beer
a
new
life
but
im
really
not
trying
to
buy
or
smell
this
beer
again
lol
o
this
is
my
favorite
dark
beer
i
can
understand
why
theres
some
dislike
for
it
but
i
love
this
beer
so
much
its
almost
a
bit
heartbreaking
to
see
and
hear
people
refer
to
it
as
piss
or
vomit
i
really
enjoy
the
fact
that
the
beer
doesnt
get
boozy
as
it
warms
up
and
allows
other
tasting
notes
to
emerge
cant
wait
to
drink
it
again
overall
a
very
unique
and
interesting
beer
it
actually
works
for
me
absolutely
horrible
taste
like
soy
sauce
and
indian
spice
a
very
different
kind
of
beer
but
very
memorable
in
a
good
way
i
love
the
spices
it
is
a
terrible
disaster
this
might
have
been
the
worst
attempt
at
any
beverage
in
the
history
of
man
the
mouthfeel
though
spit
up
almost
on
consumption
was
mouth
full
of
spices
that
were
balanced
as
if
a
deaf
dumb
blind
mute
ethiopian
wonderer
grabbed
a
cabinet
full
of
random
dirt
attempted
to
make
curry
the
taste
was
1
half
sip
away
from
vomitus
the
appearance
is
as
dark
as
night
with
a
light
stout
head
which
is
its
only
upside
im
a
us
marine
beer
snob
im
quite
aware
but
i
would
not
serve
this
swill
to
isis
militants
that
is
how
bad
this
product
is
bp
you
are
a
top
tier
beer
producer
but
on
this
you
failed
miserably
please
for
the
love
of
all
beer
drinkers
everywhere
take
this
urine
off
the
shelves
o
good
beer
not
overly
spiced
for
me
although
it
is
heavily
spiced
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
indian
foodspices
definitely
would
not
be
having
multiples
of
these
as
they
would
probably
become
more
like
eating
a
meal
than
thirst
quenching
hardest
review
i
have
ever
written
here
and
please
reserve
me
the
right
to
update
these
comments
in
the
near
future
mmmmmm
yuck
omg
auguh
try
it
again
not
much
different
reaction
this
stuff
requires
some
heavily
spiced
eastern
food
that
can
fight
back
so
i
give
this
every
point
from
05
all
over
the
place
this
is
unique
it
is
more
like
a
spicy
marinade
i
make
for
kebobs
on
the
bbq
than
something
i
intend
to
drink
clever
spicy
surprising
i
give
it
a
15
point
spread
you
are
gonna
hate
it
or
love
it
and
there
aint
no
place
inbetween
i
will
bbq
with
this
tomorrow
as
my
marinade
for
tritip
and
i
am
sure
it
is
going
to
be
awesome
overall
folks
have
given
this
55s
which
dont
exist
for
their
grapefruithabanero
ipa
which
i
love
i
thought
that
after
their
habanero
this
would
just
be
the
next
step
unfortunately
we
just
dont
click
i
see
comments
like
oh
well
if
you
dont
like
this
stick
to
bud
lite
get
out
of
here
this
is
such
a
uniquely
crafted
beer
perhaps
my
palate
will
appreciate
it
in
time
but
as
for
now
it
just
seems
like
a
risk
that
didnt
pay
off
take
the
money
youd
spend
on
this
and
try
anyall
other
b
p
brews
before
this
only
then
would
i
suggest
taking
the
dive
will
revisit
in
time
15
on
initial
opening
and
pouring
i
really
got
the
smell
of
hard
cedar
and
redwood
the
taste
is
very
much
so
with
huge
hints
of
southeastern
asian
flavors
a
very
spicy
beer
with
the
slight
stouty
taste
as
the
finish
i
didnt
like
this
beer
and
probably
will
not
buy
again
this
beer
is
amazingly
creative
big
bold
flavors
work
well
together
and
come
through
in
well
defined
layers
some
of
these
haters
should
just
stick
with
their
bud
light
notes
i
reviewed
this
so
highly
because
of
the
complexity
and
competence
with
which
these
spices
were
added
worst
beer
in
the
history
of
beers
and
i
have
drank
a
lot
of
beers
indra
kunindra
awful
kunawful
o
theres
just
too
much
going
on
for
me
with
this
beer
i
love
stouts
but
there
so
much
that
i
think
it
takes
away
from
the
stout
characteristics
i
think
all
the
added
flavors
overwhelm
what
should
be
the
main
characteristics
the
stout
flavors
i
love
the
chili
and
i
noticed
that
as
the
beer
warms
the
chili
is
more
apparent
but
all
the
other
flavors
are
just
too
much
overall
shrugs
shoulders
as
if
someone
would
ever
do
this
on
purpose
to
be
sure
i
actually
like
indian
food
and
can
appreciate
a
touch
more
heat
than
your
average
bear
but
this
is
probably
the
most
exact
and
accurate
representation
of
mistake
in
physical
form
on
the
planet
i
can
picture
the
beards
sitting
around
and
debating
whether
they
should
release
this
beer
or
not
well
this
sucks
but
we
need
to
sell
it
and
since
the
vast
majority
of
our
other
beers
are
pretty
awesome
enough
people
will
give
us
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
buy
a
bottle
so
we
can
sell
it
all
then
theyll
try
it
and
hate
it
but
they
wont
give
up
on
us
because
of
the
other
awesome
stuff
well
okay
youre
right
you
guys
are
great
but
this
the
only
logical
consequence
from
this
is
extreme
firings
extreme
mass
firings
great
beer
definite
taste
of
coconut
curry
and
lime
leaves
22oz
bottle
this
really
worked
im
quite
impressed
with
ballast
point
is
it
something
i
could
drink
all
day
no
not
at
all
should
everybody
try
at
least
a
little
bit
definitely
tastes
like
a
curry
in
a
glass
but
its
impossible
to
actually
drink
might
be
worth
cooking
with
o
like
curry
and
spice
you
will
enjoy
it
it
certain
to
be
unique
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
out
there
and
completely
delicious
it
makes
me
hungry
initially
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
of
this
especially
after
sniffing
it
as
i
poured
this
could
very
easily
have
been
some
bizarre
and
unintelligible
mess
ala
some
of
the
voodoo
doughnut
collabos
but
damn
ballast
point
nailed
it
with
this
one
taking
a
completely
left
field
combination
and
not
only
making
it
fit
and
play
nice
with
itself
but
to
craft
something
so
purely
enjoyable
my
hats
off
one
of
the
few
drain
pours
ive
had
one
taste
and
you
will
be
asking
yourself
what
in
gods
name
was
the
brewmaster
thinking
tastes
like
liquid
curry
sauce
with
a
side
of
stout
its
well
done
but
i
really
felt
like
i
was
eating
a
curry
dish
very
strange
beer
drinking
experience
indeed
what
is
hindi
for
ay
caramba
this
is
a
highly
unusual
beer
it
is
capetown
curry
in
a
glass
strong
spices
cumin
dominates
but
also
other
sweeter
notes
and
a
peppery
kick
color
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
a
worthwhile
leftfieldish
beer
i
would
definitely
get
again
you
maybe
literally
could
make
curry
with
it
but
is
maybe
a
little
high
priced
for
a
cooking
ingredient
black
beer
with
dark
brown
hues
light

is
dark

some

towards
the
end
that
dries
the
beer
out
overall
a
solid
beer
you
meet
this
chap
on
the
street
he
reads
you
some
new
wave
beat
poetry
its
avantgarde
its
weird
i
cant
help
but
like
him
though
hes
definitely
his
own
beer

was
well

with

present
after

other
than

overall
this
was
a
very
nice
spiced
stout
all
around
good
complexity
and
balance
of
darkroasted
malt
and
spice
flavors
and
quite
smooth
to

despite
the
moderate

overpowering

smoother
on

very
strong
taste
of

and
curry
on
the
finish
i
feel
like
this
one
should
be
left
to
age
a
little
while
too
much
spice
felt
as
though
i
were
drinking
strong
rum
definitely
the
most
unique
brew
i
have
ever
had
glad
to
have
tried
it
probably
would
not
willingly
drink
another
overall
what
a
weird
beer
definitely
in
a
category
all
its
own
i
love
its
flavors
though
im
not
sure
i
love
them
in
beer
still
its
ten
times
more
successful
than
most
chile
or
otherwise
oddlyspiced
brews
aromas
of
malty
curry
absolutely
no
other
way
to
describe
that
vanilla
curry
that
melts
into
a
roasted
oatiness
moderate
hops
that
are
relatively
low
bitterness
finish
is
thick
with
a
mild
coffee
aftertaste
the
curry
is
strong
in
this
one
and
lives
up
to
my
expectations
overall
a
very
well
done
beer
from
ballast
point
ive
had
stouts
that
infused
indian
spices
before
without
nearly
as
much
success
this
one
manages
to
have
a
very
forward
presence
from
the
spicing
without
it
being
overpowering
or
cloying
i
would
gladly
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
was
in
the
right
mood
it
made
me
want
to
go
get
some
tikka
masala
for
dinner
o
the
beer
is
ok
except
for
the
taste
that
part
is
rough
this
is
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
ive
ever
had
it
pours
black
with
a
light
tan
head
it
reeks
of
curry
making
you
less
than
excited
to
try
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
very
smooth
and
creamy
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
curry
is
very
overpowering
making
it
very
hard
to
finish
a
full
glass
however
surprisingly
the
curry
cayenne
and
other
spices
compliment
each
other
very
well
in
the
end
the
curry
was
just
a
bit
too
much
i
recommend
this
beer
for
uniqueness
alone
try
it
o
i
wish
the
different
flavors
blended
together
better
rather
than
seeming
to
come
in
separate
waves
the
lime
and
spice
are
so
dominant
i
hardly
could
detect
much
else
initially
still
a
fun
tasty
and
aggressive
beer
i
like
when
breweries
concoct
stuff
like
this
o
if
anything
this
is
a
bit
too
much
of
a
good
thing
i
love
curry
but
this
is
nothing
but
a
bit
of
beer
would
make
a
nice
balance
that
being
said
i
really
like
it
and
given
what
it
is
its
a
home
run
mouthfeel
is
thick
chewy
pleasant
overall
quite
tasty
i
like
it
o
if
you
really
like
curry
or
even
just
spicy
things
in
general
you
ought
to
try
this
its
a
pretty
interesting
experience
although
ultimately
this
level
of
curry
and
spice
is
not
a
flavour
profile
im
really
looking
for
in
a
beer
having
said
that
for
what
it
is
it
is
pretty
well
executed
i
love
ballast
point
offerings
and
i
like
a
wide
variety
of
beers
but
this
beer
was
too
much
for
me
i
was
expecting
a
stout
with
some
mild
indian
flavor
notes
instead
it
was
like
drinking
a
spicy
curry
indian
dinner
all
of
the
flavors
as
indicated
on
the
label
were
there
and
to
me
it
was
crafted
successfully
by
the
brewers
at
ballast
point
but
it
was
too
much
for
me
the
curry
produced
too
much
of
a
burn
for
my
palate
the
complexity
of
the
curry
coconut
lime
were
all
there
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
not
what
i
want
to
drink
in
a
beer
others
may
like
this
beer
and
i
dont
want
to
trash
the
beer
either
my
palate
just
wasnt
right
for
this
beer
o
a
curry
bomb
drinkable
but
about
halfway
through
i
stopped
liking
it
they
should
tone
back
the
curry
and
spice
and
turn
up
the
lime
and
coconut
whoa
nelly
i
was
intrigued
by
this
beer
with
the
curry
notes
in
the
aroma
and
the
hint
of
coconut
milk
and
then
i
actually
tasted
it
like
a
plateful
of
curry
strong
curry
so
strongly
flavored
that
the
curry
just
dominates
everything
i
thought
this
might
be
pleasant
with
food
but
really
its
so
highly
spiced
that
i
cant
see
it
complementing
anything
other
than
white
rice
now
mind
you
the
flavors
arent
bad
or
artificial
just
a
bit
too
much
its
certainly
interesting
and
could
actually
be
a
very
good
beer
if
it
were
reined
in
a
bit
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
great
lakes
brewing
goblet
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
an
inch
tan
head
that
fizzled
away
pretty
quickly
there
isnt
much
lacing
at
all
the
brew
smells
mostly
like
cumin
curry
and
cayenne
along
with
a
bit
of
coconut
the
spices
overpower
pretty
much
everything
else
thats
in
the
aroma
the
spices
are
strong
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
too
but
i
can
also
taste
some
lime
chocolate
and
vanilla
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
coating
and
smooth
with
a
lowmoderate
amount
of
carbonation
i
liked
this
brew
too
bad
i
only
bought
one
bomber
because
if
i
had
another
one
id
probably
drink
it
now
recommended
if
you
like
spicier
foodbeer
9
35
a
bomber
got
a
taste
of
this
as
it
sounded
crazy
interesting
at
first
it
was
so
strange
that
i
was
a
bit
apprehensive
and
did
not
think
i
could
drink
an
entire
pint
but
once
i
did
i
found
myself
going
back
for
more
smell
is
dominated
by
curry
along
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
taste
is
so
unique
curry
again
cocoa
a
mild
roasted
coffee
and
some
heat
that
does
not
overwhelm
in
the
finish
the
base
beer
does
not
drink
at
all
like
a
foreign
stout
it
is
smooth
and
slightly
malty
so
well
balanced
in
flavors
unfortunately
the
coconut
and
kaffir
leaf
are
almost
nonexistant
still
an
awesome
offering
by
ballast
point
overall
a
good
beer
but
the
stout
just
gets
crushed
by
the
spiciness
i
really
enjoy
all
the
dark
offerings
ive
had
the
pleasure
to
enjoy
from
ballast
this
one
not
so
much
i
think
im
just
not
a
spicyhot
beer
fan
atleast
not
yet
o
the
was
definitely
a
surprise
a
pleasant
one
keep
an
open
mind
and
dont
watch
reviews
i
was
terrified
before
cracking
it
i
would
definitely
buydrink
this
again
and
would
especially
if
i
found
it
on
tap
would
have
prefered
less
coconut
sweetness
but
it
isnt
offensive
of
all
notes
i
was
surprised
that
i
loved
the
chili
kick
generally
not
a
spicyhot
fankeep
in
mind
this
is
a
sipping
beer
and
not
at
all
sessionable
i
wouldve
prefered
it
in
a
regular
12oz
as
the
bomber
was
too
much
between
the
boyf
and
i
couldnt
finish
it
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
but
again
its
hard
to
imagine
ever
drinking
a
whole
lot
o
this
stuff
ill
start
off
by
stating
that
this
ballast
point
does
exactly
what
they
intended
to
do
with
this
beer
whether
or
not
that
is
a
good
thing
is
certainly
up
to
some
debate
i
purchased
the
bottle
on
a
whim
and
didnt
drink
for
probably
a
good
month
i
poured
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
and
let
it
sit
for
about
ten
minutes
to
let
it
warm
up
slightly
and
hopefully
open
up
all
of
the
flavors
that
made
it
into
the
bottle
the
smell
tells
me
what
im
about
to
taste
but
not
in
a
way
that
was
very
appetizing
it
smelled
alot
like
walking
into
a
indian
restaurant
lots
of
curry
and
spices
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
not
really
how
i
want
my
beer
to
smell
taste
was
better
the
curry
cumin
coconut
and
the
lime
all
came
through
the
best
part
of
the
flavors
were
the
balance
they
complemented
each
other
just
like
a
great
food
dish
the
saving
grace
was
the
cayenne
though
the
heat
was
just
strong
enough
to
take
the
beer
to
another
level
and
given
some
depth
after
awhile
though
as
well
constructed
as
it
was
the
novelty
wore
off
and
i
found
myself
not
wanting
to
finish
it
overall
excellent
execution
and
worth
a
try
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
beer
that
tastes
very
much
like
an
indian
dish
isnt
one
im
going
to
keep
coming
back
to
i
understand
bp
has
also
made
this
in
a
9
run
i
wonder
if
id
have
dug
it
more
as
for
this
take
i
wouldnt
say
its
something
id
seek
out
again
however
i
give
it
credit
for
being
completely
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
ever
tried
i
enjoyed
it
just
enough
o
an
interesting
brew
and
original
for
sure
but
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
too
spicy
for
me
but
then
again
i
am
not
crazy
on
indian
food
so
to
be
expected
o
presuming
youre
interested
in
the
indian
spices
this
beer
is
a
musttry
and
i
suspect
itll
be
greatly
enjoyed
for
people
more
cautious
on
their
attitude
toward
indian
spices
but
willing
to
try
something
different
i
suspect
theyll
also
enjoy
a
pour
of
this
while
the
spices
dictate
a
great
deal
of
the
entire
experience
they
are
not
used
stupidly
or
unabashedly
this
is
a
very
balanced
experience
that
happens
to
hang
out
with
indian
spices
perhaps
the
must
fun
aspect
of
this
beer
is
just
how
drastically
the
drinking
experience
changes
while
you
come
to
terms
with
the
spices
fun
wish
this
was
available
in
six
packs
i
would
buy
it
often
o
it
all
blends
together
really
well
and
tastes
interesting
weird
and
delicious
a
kick
of
cayenne
remains
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
wonderfully
weird
and
strange
delicious
but
you
have
to
like
indian
spices
to
like
this
beer
the
beer
is
black
with
a
thin
beige
cap
the
aroma
brings
chocolate
hot
pepper
spice
some
dark
chocolate
with
oranges
and
citrusy
spice
heat
gains
strength
and
intensity
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
beer
cayenne
pepper
and
spicy
heat
lingers
amid
dark
chocolate
not
too
heavy
this
beer
achieves
its
intended
purpose
and
for
that
i
will
give
credit
however
i
dont
see
myself
returning
to
this
one
as
i
dont
find
pleasure
in
the
combination
of
beer
and
spicy
heat
o
overall
i
gave
consideration
for
its
uniquiness
and
what
they
were
intending
to
do
rather
then
shoe
horn
and
punish
this
by
style
for
a
more
focused
attention
on
the
spices
then
the
roasted
and
coffee
nature
an
uniquely
spiced
export
stout
that
highlights
the
asian
induced
spices
with
a
very
good
balance
and
represenatation
a
definite
consideration
for
a
one
time
sampling
to
try
something
outside
the
box
o
i
didnt
know
what
to
think
at
first
this
beer
surly
is
interesting
i
like
it
i
dont
think
its
an
a
beer
but
i
think
its
good
one
thing
that
disappointed
me
was
the
misleading
style
name
i
expected
more
desert
and
less
curry
although
im
a
big
fan
of
curry
it
was
still
a
good
buy
though
o
well
this
was
exactly
what
it
said
was
going
to
be
it
was
a
different
and
challenging
beer
for
me
very
interesting
and
i
think
i
would
recommend
it
for
someone
looking
to
try
something
very
different
or
as
a
change
of
pace
certainly
not
an
everyday
drinker
o
over
all
id
say
this
was
definitely
a
sipping
beer
and
is
better
suited
to
be
paired
with
food
i
had
this
on
its
own
as
a
night
cap
and
it
did
the
job
fine
but
i
wish
i
had
it
with
food
to
see
if
it
exploded
any
more
great
brewery
nice
beer
and
i
might
try
it
again
this
screams
indian
food
if
you
dont
like
it
chances
are
you
probably
wont
like
this
beer
its
a
full
on
curry
spice
assault
on
the
palate
good
chili
heat
as
well
the
bottle
version
seems
to
be
hotter
in
terms
of
chile
spice
than
on
tap
curry
lovers
you
have
found
your
beer
o
a
very
unique
taste
experience
for
sure
personally
this
one
is
a
little
too
much
for
me
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
but
im
judging
this
based
on
style
and
description
overall
this
beer
is
a
love
and
hate
relationship
i
really
dont
know
what
to
think
i
love
the
beer
by
the
way
it
tastes
but
hate
it
by
the
way
the
taste
im
used
to
expecting
wheres
the
stout
such
a
strange
interesting
beer
a
very
different
beer
it
was
offputting
at
first
but
once
i
threw
out
expectations
and
went
along
for
the
ride
it
really
wasnt
bad
truly
unique
this
is
a
very
different
beer
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
it
i
could
taste
the
curry
cayenne
and
lime
leaf
its
complex
and
interesting
i
found
it
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
it
was
fun
sorting
through
all
the
different
flavors
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
every
one
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
unusual
definitely
give
it
a
try
first
of
all
whether
or
not
you
like
curry
is
going
to
either
make
or
break
this
beer
probably
not
going
to
be
too
many
gray
area
people
on
this
you
either
like
curry
and
coconut
and
will
probably
like
this
beer
or
not
i
do
like
curry
so
this
beer
went
over
better
with
me
than
with
some
people
pours
dark
looks
nice
taste
is
lots
of
curry
lots
of
cayanne
heat
and
some
silkiness
from
the
coconut
not
really
anything
traditionally
recognizable
as
beer
flavored
interesting
and
unique
somehow
this
beer
works
well
it
does
focus
more
on
the
specialty
ingredients
than
the
beer
flavors
themselves
but
theres
enough
there
to
remind
you
its
a
beer
the
curry
on
the
nose
is
overwhelming
and
can
take
a
bit
from
the
flavor
if
you
get
to
big
of
a
whiff
so
i
suggest
drinking
out
of
a
pint
or
something
curry
can
be
a
little
overwhelming
at
times
but
a
pretty
complex
beer
with
waves
of
cool
flavor
medium
body
is
nicely
smooth
but
a
bit
thin
overall
i
liked
this
a
lot
more
than
i
thought
i
would
and
would
get
it
again
just
to
foster
this
kind
of
freakiness
among
brewers
not
scary
or
offputting
at
all
i
think
it
would
go
quite
well
with
sushi
or
chinese
takeaway
wonderful
to
find
this
one
hidden
in
the
cooler
appearance
is
opaque
with
minimal
head
aroma
definately
has
curry
and
coconut
decent
lacing
taste
on
the
front
is
is
slightly
roasted
moving
quickly
into
cumin
curry
with
a
very
warming
affect
overall
i
am
very
impressed
and
look
forward
to
drinking
more
in
the
winter
interesting
one
to
share
as
this
is
a
bomber
hard
to
finish
but
not
because
you
dislike
it
but
because
it
is
just
alot
of
spice
finally
got
around
to
grabbing
another
bottle
of
this
i
said
this
was
a
one
time
only
purchase
but
i
was
wrong
i
have
been
craving
this
beer
since
the
first
time
i
tried
it
revisiting
it
i
find
more
beloved
coconut
than
before
its
just
such
a
unique
beer
its
ridiculous
its
also
spicier
than
i
remember
actual
heat
from
the
cayenne
tickling
heat
hangs
in
my
lips
really
hard
to
judge
this
beer
after
everything
is
considered
its
an
abomination
that
i
love
a
frankenstein
definitely
raised
my
original
rating
from
a
4
07
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
yellowish
tan
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
to
a
thick
collar
and
a
few
streaks
of
lace
heavy
coconut
and
curry
on
the
nose
and
not
much
else
fairly
sweet
medium
thick
high
carbonation
body
soft
on
the
palate
and
very
spicy
on
the
finish
flavor
starts
sweet
and
malty
milk
chocolate
and
coconut
before
finishing
with
a
variety
of
spices
i
cant
identify
that
continue
to
build
in
heat
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
front
of
the
tongue
long
into
the
finish
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
oily
jet
black
coloring
with
brown
tints
around
the
edges
and
no
head
whatsoever
looks
heavy
and
dense
aromas
of
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
enveloped
in
curry
spices
very
interesting
blending
on
the
nose
flavors
are
curry
forward
with
both
spice
and
heat
followed
by
a
ribbon
of
chocolate
and
coffee
both
bitter
and
sweet
and
then
the
beer
transitions
back
into
the
spice
and
heat
of
curry
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
warming
and
the
warmth
lingers
throughout
the
finish
and
for
quite
a
while
after
as
well
the
finish
is
slick
and
smooth
this
is
a
very
unique
take
on
an
export
stout
i
am
very
intrigued
by
it
and
it
would
make
for
some
interesting
food
pairings
because
it
seems
like
it
can
easily
overpower
this
beer
is
definitely
not
in
my
wheelhouse
i
am
not
a
hug
fan
of
curry
but
i
was
willing
to
give
this
beer
a
try
i
wanted
to
like
it
by
could
not
get
past
the
curry
i
wish
it
was
more
my
style
i
would
recommended
it
to
to
the
fans
of
curry
out
there
they
probably
can
get
past
the
curry
flavor
that
i
cant
if
you
dont
like
curry
dont
try
this
but
if
you
are
open
minded
enough
might
be
worth
a
try
overall
if
you
dont
like
curry
or
heat
steer
clear
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
specialty
beers
out
there
if
you
have
one
and
would
like
to
trade
let
me
know
wow
this
beer
is
the
most
interesting
beer
ive
ever
had
by
far
these
are
spices
im
very
familiar
with
the
smell
is
an
aggressive
hit
of
curry
cumin
and
cayenne
for
sure
the
taste
is
sweet
chocolate
with
a
finish
of
all
the
spices
in
the
nose
i
absolutely
love
it
if
you
want
a
new
experience
in
beer
and
you
like
indian
food
or
spicy
asian
food
this
is
a
must
try
mixed
reviews
are
totally
understandable
but
ill
always
remember
this
beer
overall
good
if
you
like
hot
stuff
but
its
quite
spicy
yep
i
found
this
beer
to
be
really
enjoyable
if
the
consumer
can
sit
back
and
appreciate
what
the
brewer
was
looking
to
accomplish
if
youre
benchmark
for
this
style
is
guinness
foreign
export
this
may
not
be
the
beer
for
you
but
the
collaboration
on
this
beer
really
did
a
nice
job
incorporating
the
india
style
ingredients
to
a
traditional
brew
pours
jet
black
with
a
brownish
head
in
the
aroma
curry
cayenne
pepper
and
small
lime
citrus
in
the
taste
lime
small
curry
and
notes
of
cayenne
pepper
spice
a
small
spice
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
lime
cayenne
pepper
and
curry
notes
in
the
aftertaste
big
lime
mellow
curry
and
big
spice
in
the
end
different
but
enjoyable
this
is
a
beer
where
the
label
tells
you
what
youre
getting
yourself
into
this
is
a
curry
beer
it
smells
like
curry
it
tastes
like
curry
the
aftertaste
burns
just
a
bit
in
the
back
of
the
throat
just
like
curry
if
the
concept
of
drinking
a
good
curry
doesnt
interest
you
stay
the
hell
away
from
this
beer
i
love
curry
i
love
stouts
and
this
exceeded
my
expectations
a
tasty
and
surprisingly
drinkable
novelty
well
its
interesting
to
say
at
least
a
stout
by
color
and
maybe
malts
but
i
would
say
the
body
was
a
bit
more
like
a
dark
ale
the
spices
of
cinnamon
and
curry
dominate
the
flavor
profile
there
is
a
root
beerlicorice
quality
that
develops
as
the
beer
warms
carbonation
is
low
i
think
that
it
is
worth
a
try
as
it
is
truly
a
unique
brew
easily
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
drink
that
appeals
to
both
the
beer
lover
and
foodie
in
me
im
not
always
into
beers
with
crazy
flavors
but
indra
kunindra
is
mindboggling
and
one
of
a
kind
its
not
often
that
a
beer
will
blow
my
mind
anymore
ive
tried
many
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
risk
taken
in
releasing
it
for
10
a
bottle
a
beer
had
better
be
something
special
this
could
have
been
a
giant
trainwreck
but
instead
it
raises
the
bar
of
whats
possible
in
brewing
im
starting
to
secondguess
what
i
look
for
in
an
export
stout
maybe
they
should
all
taste
like
authentic
indian
curry
and
have
a
bite
that
stings
spicy
i
like
savory
i
like
this
is
a
beer
that
i
need
to
stock
up
at
least
in
this
household
my
girlfriend
calls
this
the
best
beer
she
has
ever
had
i
disagree
but
it
might
not
be
too
far
off
im
a
sucker
ballast
point
nailed
it
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
from
them
youre
a
boldfaced
liar
if
you
think
this
couldve
been
much
better
do
you
like
indian
food
do
you
crave
the
strange
and
the
exotic
cmon
now
folks
not
much
noticeable
booze
and
the
idea
becomes
fruition
invent
a
style
for
a
beer
like
this
and
its
a
record
that
will
never
be
broken
so
good
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
but
then
again
i
also
like
indian
curry
naan
bread
samosas
and
certain
bollywood
flicks
so
your
mileage
may
vary
i
say
pick
it
up
what
an
amzingly
balanced
beer
so
many
interesting
flavors
in
my
mouth
huge
notes
of
curry
and
spices
finishing
with
a
magical
waterfall
of
coconut
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
after
a
nice
meal
id
love
to
meet
the
guy
who
came
up
with
this
recipe
22
oz
bottle
served
in
a
tumbler
glass
pours
a
cola
color
with
a
fizzy
brown
and
almost
instantly
diminishing
head
aroma
is
roasted
malt
cumin
curry
pepper
and
chocolate
flavor
is
roasted
malt
curry
pepper
lime
vanilla
a
hint
of
coconut
and
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
medium
dry
bitter
low
carbonation
and
mighty
spicy
very
interesting
beer
the
aroma
is
slightly
scary
but
the
malt
background
allows
a
bit
of
a
balance
with
the
spiciness
poured
from
a
bomber
into
2
snifters
jet
black
with
a
moderate
head
the
aroma
is
lots
of
spicey
curry
the
spiciness
of
the
curry
is
the
dominant
flavor
there
are
also
subtle
hints
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
body
is
moderate
good
carbonation
lad
i
split
it
with
a
friend
one
of
the
more
interesting
brews
i
have
had
but
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
indian
food
dont
pick
this
one
up
for
me
the
curry
was
a
little
too
much
o
i
couldnt
imagine
how
good
with
would
go
with
some
butter
chicken
or
any
curried
meat
never
had
a
beer
like
this
before
but
what
a
masterpiece
of
building
indianthai
qualities
into
a
beer
o
come
one
peeps
you
know
you
love
this
beer
the
most
unique
brew
of
2013
so
far
id
have
it
again
i
dont
care
if
you
dont
like
curry
you
have
to
admit
this
beer
is
brilliantly
made
horrifically
underrated
here
on
ba
this
pours
a
radiant
inky
black
color
unsuspicious
and
boasting
an
inch
or
so
of
lacy
mocha
head
the
nose
is
just
insane
like
dank
takeout
indian
food
there
is
all
of
the
elements
curry
powder
cumin
which
is
very
strong
kaffir
lime
leaf
which
is
almost
refreshing
amidst
all
the
dark
roast
and
coconut
to
sweeten
things
up
there
is
also
the
cayenne
if
you
take
a
really
hard
sniff
it
almost
burns
the
nostrils
true
to
form
the
taste
is
every
bit
as
good
as
the
nose
like
exceptional
takeout
food
the
curry
is
strong
the
cumin
is
fresh
the
chili
is
just
in
the
finish
and
the
coconut
and
lime
leaf
cut
through
some
of
the
other
heavy
flavors
i
can
only
imagine
how
many
times
they
made
this
beer
wrong
or
out
of
proportion
before
they
got
it
right
it
certainly
is
dialed
now
seriously
fantastic
the
mix
of
flavors
here
is
like
nothing
i
would
have
ever
expected
in
a
beer
i
have
to
say
a
whole
bottle
would
have
been
too
much
and
im
not
sure
im
in
a
hurry
to
find
this
again
but
what
a
wonderful
treat
to
get
to
try
such
a
creative
and
artfully
crafted
bottle
of
beer
this
is
really
something
special
and
it
puts
the
countless
spiced
beers
to
shame
you
wont
believe
this
beer
until
you
taste
it
a
good
snack
to
have
with
this
pint
is
some
good
fresh
toasted
coconut
macaroons
as
they
pair
absolutely
perfect
with
this
beer
oh
and
is
curry
and
the
other
spices
and
afrodisiak
well
they
seemed
to
be
for
me
o
there
is
a
surprising
amount
of
spiciness
to
this
beer
probably
a
bit
hotter
than
the
average
indian
food
that
i
have
ordered
all
over
the
us
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
kick
to
the
spiciness
but
it
does
make
the
beer
a
little
tougher
to
drink
much
of
definitely
reduces
the
drinkability
lots
of
complexity
to
the
flavors
and
smells
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
ov
very
very
enjoyable
one
of
my
favourites
to
drink
either
by
itself
or
to
pair
with
food
again
dont
know
how
ballast
point
managed
to
get
all
these
flavours
to
blend
and
work
together
but
they
did
so
much
flavour
here
if
youre
a
both
a
beer
geek
and
foodie
who
appreciates
things
outside
the
box
seems
a
couple
reviewers
didnt
get
the
aspect
bp
was
going
for
overall
im
very
impressed
this
is
a
supremely
interesting
beer
that
manages
both
to
do
something
unique
and
to
provide
a
balanced
and
comprehensive
beer
experience
extremely
interesting
and
engaging
stuff
this
has
to
be
a
polarizing
brew
you
must
like
the
spices
added
to
like
this
beer
fortunately
i
do
and
this
is
one
of
ballast
points
better
pepper
series
brews
i
am
a
little
worried
that
the
flavor
profile
may
get
cloying
by
the
time
i
get
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
black
translucent
at
the
edges
tan
head
nose
of
lime
coconut
milk
cayenne
and
curry
are
quite
prominent
as
well
ultraunique
really
smells
of
indian
cuisine
tastes
again
of
lime
and
coconut
cayenne
and
roast
are
there
dark
chocolate
as
well
cayenne
stings
into
the
finish
medium
thin
body
suited
to
the
beer
with
a
lower
medium
carbonation
an
original
beer
spice
and
the
dregs
of
every
glass
poured
is
super
spicy
o
as
fas
as
im
concerned
this
is
a
chile
stout
and
i
really
like
that
kind
of
thing
but
i
also
understand
that
others
may
not
the
cayenne
is
very
dominant
accented
with
smoke
and
lime
and
underscored
by
the
dark
stout
malts
and
their
respective
flavors
definitely
an
indiastyle
export
stout
reviewed
from
notes
appearance
is
a
dark
opaque
brown
not
quite
black
brown
head
forms
and
retains
nicely
the
smell
is
incredibly
unique
lots
of
curry
and
lime
come
through
up
front
with
some
coconut
and
spice
to
follow
the
state
is
more
spice
forward
and
starts
with
some
ancho
chili
followed
by
a
dark
chocolate
quality
the
finish
features
a
touch
of
licorice
quite
the
journey
of
flavored
here
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
with
medium
carbonation
this
was
an
ambitious
project
by
ballast
point
and
i
think
they
did
a
good
job
at
bringing
together
so
many
odd
flavor
in
a
brew
this
would
pair
nicely
with
pad
thai
oh
yes
and
bring
me
ill
be
needing
more
indra
kunindra
to
smother
all
over
my
body
o
intense
flavorful
and
unique
somehow
it
all
comes
together
if
i
had
a
complaint
it
would
be
that
theres
very
little
of
the
base
beer
here
and
certainly
not
many
characteristics
of
a
stout
definitely
a
sipper
due
to
the
spice
and
a
beer
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
that
said
it
is
masterfully
done
and
a
must
try
for
fans
of
hot
indian
or
thai
curries
do
although
unconventional
this
spiced
stout
is
appealingat
a
distance
the
smell
is
very
interesting
savory
with
no
indication
of
the
messy
and
unbalanced
flavor
to
come
heat
is
a
problem
quickly
escalating
to
an
undrinkable
level
after
setting
this
beer
aside
as
a
beverage
it
was
able
to
redeem
itself
in
remarkable
fashion
as
a
cooking
ingredient
o
originally
purchased
as
an
exercise
for
the
palate
indra
is
a
unique
and
welcomed
departure
from
the
classic
stout
style
i
enjoyed
the
spice
charachteristics
which
add
depth
and
complexity
but
ultimately
wanted
more
balance
with
the
inherent
dark
sweetness
of
the
stout
style
and
stronger
coconut
presence
overall
worth
a
shot
but
wish
this
came
in
a
12oz
instead
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
black
color
with
a
quick
fading
head
on
top
there
is
no
retention
of
lacing
at
all
on
this
not
the
nicest
looking
stout
the
smell
if
big
there
was
some
initial
coconut
at
first
but
its
quickly
overpowered
by
the
lime
and
spice
on
this
brew
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
very
unique
flavor
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
lime
flavored
doritos
with
a
spicy
salsa
there
is
plenty
of
lime
and
spice
on
this
beer
the
coconut
is
kind
of
hidden
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
carbonated
with
a
thinner
body
to
it
overall
this
beer
is
unique
its
not
something
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
but
it
was
interesting
to
try
o
i
think
i
like
it
points
for
being
interesting
as
hell
and
not
being
entirely
terrible
it
pulls
it
off
better
than
i
thought
it
might
i
imagine
this
would
go
well
maybe
with
actual
curries
and
the
like
if
you
dont
like
indian
food
avoid
this
beer
o
im
so
glad
i
decided
to
pick
this
up
as
its
very
unique
and
experimental
in
a
good
way
although
the
spice
profile
is
huge
it
is
somewhat
balanced
by
the
roast
and
citrus
definitely
a
sipper
and
would
be
interesting
to
pair
this
with
some
sort
of
asian
cuisine
high
b
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
light
to
moderate
carbonation
this
has
a
decent
spice
to
it
but
its
well
balanced
by
the
smooth
coconut
this
is
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
id
certainly
get
it
again
this
was
my
first
foreign
export
style
beer
although
i
dont
like
indian
food
to
me
that
was
what
this
beer
was
all
about
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
and
something
nice
to
try
o
i
enjoy
experimentation
and
unique
spins
on
styles
as
much
as
the
next
person
but
this
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
the
dominance
of
the
curry
made
this
one
difficult
to
enjoy
though
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
doubt
ill
try
it
again
but
i
commend
ballast
point
for
trying
something
new
and
unique
o
i
can
sum
up
this
beer
in
a
single
word
bizarre
this
is
a
fun
beer
with
a
lot
of
things
going
on
but
i
think
its
too
spicy
in
that
its
not
balanced
well
if
the
spices
were
more
in
line
with
the
stout
malts
so
they
each
complimented
each
other
bam
you
got
a
winner
jet
black
with
a
beautiful
khaki
tan
head
some
sediment
fallen
and
collected
at
the
bottom
of
my
glass
a
water
goblet
the
nose
was
molasses
and
booze
with
an
extra
unexpected
scent
a
smell
of
sweet
coconut
curry
i
loved
the
taste
of
this
vanilla
bourbon
dark
chocolate
and
sweet
coconut
curry
immediately
followed
by
a
spicy
chile
burn
at
the
back
of
the
palate
that
lingers
through
the
finish
as
the
beer
warmed
the
flavors
became
even
more
intense
and
accessible
the
chile
spice
gave
me
a
bit
of
heartburn
to
be
honest
the
mouthfeel
was
very
pleasing
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
thick
mouthfeel
that
coated
the
palate
without
being
oily
i
highly
recommend
this
to
every
craft
beer
lover
as
this
is
a
truly
unique
brew
and
done
well
which
leads
to
a
weird
score
the
overall
is
higher
than
it
should
seem
because
what
makes
this
beer
great
isnt
really
accounted
for
in
the
four
metrics
given
very
spicy
and
interesting
the
flavor
profile
was
more
thai
than
indian
for
me
strong
curry
and
coconut
notes
slightly
jarring
flavor
profile
ballast
point
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
i
appreciate
it
when
a
brewery
tries
something
different
everyone
should
try
this
beer
once
since
its
flavor
is
so
unique
but
i
doubt
that
ill
be
coming
back
for
seconds
o
extremely
unique
beer
in
a
good
way
would
definitely
grab
some
for
home
if
my
local
place
gets
some
not
one
that
other
beers
can
follow
well
due
to
the
lingering
presence
of
the
spices
if
youre
out
trying
several
to
see
what
you
like
be
sure
to
save
this
one
for
last
o
this
beer
is
quite
unique
and
is
quite
spicy
its
not
the
easiest
beer
to
drink
but
is
probably
as
drinkable
as
you
could
get
for
a
spiced
beer
this
is
a
really
hard
beer
to
review
i
really
like
the
fact
that
it
is
so
unique
but
when
it
comes
down
to
the
question
of
would
i
buy
or
even
drink
this
again
probably
not
o
5
0
for
uniqueness
really
interesting
beer
and
i
have
never
tasted
anything
like
it
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
something
different
side
note
this
beer
is
tough
on
many
stomachs
the
chile
and
spices
can
really
work
it
over
i
wish
id
had
it
earlier
in
the
evening
to
digest
it
through
more
easily
so
odd
more
like
food
than
beer
not
unenjoyable
but
its
like
indian
food
you
damn
well
better
be
in
the
mood
a
for
uniqueness
overall
a
really
a
solid
beer
with
a
tremendous
flavor
profile
this
isnt
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
due
to
fatigue
but
it
is
very
enjoyable
in
small
bomber
sized
quantites
this
is
very
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
this
would
be
great
with
a
meal
or
as
a
meal
you
should
definitely
check
it
out
in
one
word
just
flat
up
awesome
this
is
the
kind
of
craft
that
really
impresses
me
just
needs
some
cardamom
or
garam
masala
and
we
are
taking
this
to
the
next
level
baby
overall
i
feared
this
brew
for
a
month
or
two
letting
it
sit
in
the
fridge
daring
me
to
try
it
im
glad
i
finally
did
it
has
bright
kaffir
lime
leaf
flavors
and
a
smooth
and
floral
finish
it
is
very
flavorful
and
definitely
unique
the
burn
in
the
back
of
your
throat
is
welcome
despite
being
quite
crisp
for
a
beer
this
dark
it
is
also
rich
i
could
have
only
one
of
these
drinkability
this
might
have
a
touch
too
much
spice
to
be
highly
drinkable
im
not
sure
whether
curry
belongs
in
beer
but
i
think
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
can
be
done
o
definitely
one
of
the
most
unique
flavor
combinations
in
a
beer
that
ive
ever
had
usually
experiments
like
this
fail
miserably
but
this
one
turned
out
while
well
roasted
malt
tends
to
go
well
with
chile
pepper
heat
and
the
coconut
brings
a
nice
toasty
aspect
lots
of
spices
everywhere
that
are
hard
to
describe
but
contribute
to
the
spicyhot
aspects
of
this
beer
nice
balance
of
flavors
to
boot
othis
is
just
an
awesome
beer
ive
never
ever
had
anything
like
this
i
was
expecting
some
sort
of
weird
dogfish
headesque
concoction
that
is
weird
and
okay
but
doesnt
quite
flow
right
but
this
flows
right
very
right
its
so
yummy
its
something
i
can
drink
all
night
ill
actually
be
craving
this
when
its
gone
i
know
so
the
spice
hits
so
well
overall
quite
a
unique
beer
the
spices
really
come
out
and
dominate
everything
else
and
teh
beer
itself
is
kinda
lost
in
it
all
its
somewhat
tasty
as
im
starting
to
really
enjoy
well
done
curry
but
all
in
all
its
hard
to
get
the
beer
aspect
of
it
the
pepper
heat
is
nice
for
me
as
well
as
coconut
but
still
hard
to
really
enjoy
it
as
a
beer
pours
a
nearly
black
and
opaque
with
a
dark
khaki
head
banana
cocoa
coconut
and
some
unfamiliar
spice
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
thick
chewy
and
smooth
coconut
cardamom
ginger
and
clove
my
goodness
this
is
so
magnificent
and
unique
i
took
one
of
these
home
overall
i
liked
the
beer
and
im
definitely
glad
i
picked
it
up
but
i
dont
know
if
i
need
to
have
this
one
again
if
you
like
curry
this
beer
is
a
must
try
if
you
dont
like
curry
stay
far
away
i
realize
there
plenty
of
coffee
and
raspberry
flavored
beers
in
the
stout
categories
but
why
isnt
this
a
herbedspiced
beer
you
could
only
rate
the
spice
flavors
which
are
totally
heavyhanded
not
the
fleeting
beeriness
from
the
22
oz
bottle
o
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
drank
definitely
not
sure
what
to
expect
and
im
not
sure
if
i
like
the
outcome
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
drain
pour
candidate
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
another
one
spices
seem
to
dominate
the
malt
bill
and
im
not
sure
if
im
feeling
carbonation
or
my
tongue
starting
to
burn
not
bad
at
all
though
if
youre
looking
for
an
interesting
beer
thats
kinda
dfh
like
in
oddity
then
this
one
is
right
up
your
alley
the
coconut
is
nice
but
a
bit
of
subtlety
from
the
spice
would
have
been
lovely
instead
of
it
being
so
in
your
face
overall
this
beer
was
a
bit
too
spicy
and
the
curry
and
cayenne
is
too
up
front
here
a
small
glass
is
all
you
can
have
in
a
single
session
pours
black
with
a
edge
and
some
etch
of
mocha
foam
smells
like
curry
mix
in
the
spice
jar
still
profoundly
strong
oddly
the
lime
comes
through
and
actually
as
it
warms
i
think
the
cumin
is
what
may
put
this
over
the
edge
for
appreciation
i
love
curry
and
i
love
cumin
but
a
little
too
much
here
flavor
is
like
biting
into
a
cumin
kaffir
massamun
curry
ball
with
a
bit
of
cocoa
and
coffee
i
cant
stress
this
enough
the
beer
needs
to
warm
up
substantially
medium
bodied
with
moderated
carb
and
a
relatively
dry
finish
unless
you
really
like
indian
food
and
the
spices
used
in
it
then
stay
away
from
this
poison
this
is
an
interesting
stout
its
a
little
too
curry
dominant
for
my
tastes
still
worth
a
try
made
me
want
lamb
vindaloo
good
grocery
list
beer
usually
the
adjuncts
are
overpowering
and
messy
or
too
subtle
to
be
worthwhile
but
this
was
a
good
mix
wow
quite
a
beer
its
flavor
is
very
unique
and
awesome
but
it
is
also
damn
difficult
to
drink
even
splitting
the
bomber
was
kind
of
a
chore
i
wouldve
been
good
with
a
4oz
pour
of
this
definitely
worth
trying
especially
if
you
like
spiceindian
food
but
to
me
its
a
novelty
beer
o
this
is
a
strange
and
interesting
brew
a
bit
heavy
on
the
lime
for
my
tastes
and
deffinatly
heavy
on
the
spice
like
unsaid
before
reminds
me
of
a
sweaty
indian
guy
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
dont
see
myself
hurrying
to
pick
up
another
o
ive
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
it
was
much
better
its
a
little
too
smooth
out
of
the
bottle
for
my
taste
this
a
tasty
and
unique
beer
and
well
worth
the
effort
to
taste
d
very
drinkable
very
interesting
blend
of
curry
spices
in
the
export
stout
good
overall
balance
with
great
complexity

served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
taster
flute
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
curry
indian
food
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
spices
curry
and
meat
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
on
this
one
when
i
first
saw
once
i
took
my
first
smell
of
it
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
was
this
dry
hopped
with
indian
food
was
one
of
my
first
thoughts
i
happen
to
like
indian
food
but
why
does
my
beer
smell
like
it
the
same
went
on
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
it
tasted
like
curried
meat
which
was
quite
surprising
i
could
see
this
going
well
with
a
nice
dish
of
indian
food
but
on
its
own
im
not
too
sure
about
glad
i
got
to
experience
something
this
strange
but
doubt
i
will
do
so
again
the
pepper
heat
builds
up
on
this
with
each
sip
which
makes
it
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
drink
a
whole
bomber
of
nevertheless
it
is
an
interesting
brew
that
works
with
a
food
pairing
i
thought
it
was
good
with
a
southwestern
style
chile
would
work
even
better
with
indian
curries
ill
try
that
option
with
one
of
my
remaining
bottles
there
arent
many
things
i
regret
in
this
life
but
tasting
this
beer
is
one
of
them
too
overpowering
and
the
aftertaste
stays
with
you
forever
tried
chasing
it
down
with
some
high
quality
h2o
but
no
luck
f
grade
beer
lets
never
speak
of
this
beer
again
o
an
absolutely
awesome
chilicurry
stout
ive
had
chili
beers
before
but
nothing
that
a
also
incorporated
curry
and
coconut
and
b
did
it
very
well
it
was
also
very
drinkable
i
polished
off
an
8
oz
pour
with
no
problem
at
all
this
beer
is
a
real
treat
to
drink
drink
unique
layered
semi
balanced
the
coconut
spice
was
a
good
combo
for
me
very
flavorful
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
mahogany
highlights
at
the
edges
half
finger
light
brown
head
dissipated
slowly
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
with
light
lacing
interesting
aroma
of
sweet
dark
malt
coconut
and
pepper
with
hints
of
curry
and
cocoa
flavor
is
also
unusual
coconut
is
instantly
obvious
on
the
start
with
sweet
and
roasted
malt
chocolate
immediately
covered
with
peppery
spices
finishes
peppery
and
spicy
with
the
heat
clearly
from
hot
pepper
and
not
from
hops
the
spices
definitely
dominate
most
of
the
taste
of
this
stout
but
the
body
while
not
intense
supports
the
spicy
flavors
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
and
enjoyed
the
whole
bomber
in
one
evening
not
for
the
hot
pepper
andor
coconut
adverse
i
would
pick
this
up
again
if
it
was
available
please
come
to
washington
ballast
point
overall
this
is
well
crafted
recipe
in
which
the
spices
are
blended
in
well
and
not
too
overbearing
but
they
do
take
the
forefront
and
leave
the
base
stout
taste
in
the
back
seat
o
a
very
interesting
beer
overall
good
but
cant
say
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
but
i
will
say
it
is
very
different
and
the
blend
of
flavors
does
seem
to
work
in
a
rather
odd
fashion
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
coconut
curry
spice
and
lemongrass
taste
is
very
much
the
same
with
a
spicy
finish
after
each
sip
very
tasty
stuff
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
with
some
awesome
indian
food
elements
added
into
it
a
real
surprise
for
me
hv
o
this
beer
is
insane
on
the
flavors
and
completely
worth
it
if
you
can
even
find
it
lucky
me
i
have
2
more
bottles
poured
from
bomber
to
pint
glass
pours
a
thick
oily
black
color
with
a
small
1
finger
mocha
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
throughout
very
unique
nose
coconut
roasted
malt
curry
hints
of
pepper
and
heat
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
huge
coconut
flavor
that
mellows
out
into
a
complex
blend
of
curry
roast
pepper
cocoa
and
a
bit
of
lime
very
unique
finishes
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
mild
bitterness
overall
this
is
quite
a
unique
brew
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
sampled
it
i
can
easily
say
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
id
recommend
it
if
for
nothing
else
the
unique
flavor
interesting
beer
but
definately
one
to
split
a
bottle
with
23
people
o
overall
a
very
interesting
stout
wasnt
necessarily
bad
but
a
very
weird
and
interesting
mix
that
didnt
do
it
for
me
some
people
really
liked
it
as
it
tastes
a
lot
like
thai
style
coconut
curry
but
that
isnt
what
i
really
would
want
in
a
beer
and
i
think
we
all
found
it
tough
to
drink
5
oz
s
not
something
id
seek
out
again
pours
a
inky
black
with
a
creamy
mochacolored
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
cap
and
leaves
lots
of
streaky
lacing
fantastic
nose
of
sweet
malt
coconut
curry
powder
and
spices
so
insane
perfectly
captures
a
thai
curry
taste
is
just
as
amazing
tons
of
coconut
chocolate
malt
curry
powder
and
spices
with
a
hit
of
lime
and
a
subtle
chili
pepper
spiciness
that
build
as
the
beer
warms
and
you
drink
more
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
good
carbonation
such
an
insane
beer
and
truly
one
of
the
most
unique
and
memorable
ive
had
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
with
a
medium
tannishbrown
head
that
disappears
slowly
scent
is
heavy
with
coconut
and
a
plethora
of
spices
that
make
my
nose
tingle
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
a
little
bit
of
lime
taste
is
initially
dark
chocolate
with
just
a
bit
of
anise
i
get
a
lot
of
coconut
just
a
hint
of
curry
with
a
ton
of
cayenne
and
cumin
the
cayenne
lingers
on
the
throat
and
tongue
with
tingly
spiciness
a
bit
of
alcohol
as
well
as
it
warms
the
curry
comes
through
more
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
spicy
and
tingly
drinkability
is
fair
overall
this
is
a
unique
beer
but
all
the
spices
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
tasty
though
m
medium
comexioun
slightly
creamy
overall
i
wasnt
going
to
buy
this
beer
because
quite
frankly
it
sounded
disgusting
but
the
clerk
at
holiday
wine
cellar
talked
me
into
it
and
man
am
i
glad
he
did
a
crazy
idea
that
totally
came
together
and
just
worked
i
split
this
bomber
with
a
friend
and
we
were
blown
away
a
unique
and
highly
recommended
brew
if
you
can
find
it
the
bottle
calls
this
an
indian
style
export
stout
and
wordplay
aside
i
would
probably
call
this
a
thai
stlye
stout
as
far
as
pure
flavors
go
an
extreme
beer
that
pushes
boundaries
that
nobody
seems
to
have
even
approached
before
utterly
unique
tantalizingly
exotic
and
simply
sublime
d
wish
i
had
just
one
glass
this
one
is
fun
but
wont
be
after
23
650
ml
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
big
coconut
some
curry
some
light
lime
and
a
bit
of
roast
very
unique
the
initial
taste
is
sweet
coconut
milk
followed
by
some
light
curry
a
bit
of
lime
cumin
and
a
bit
of
roast
the
finish
has
a
light
bitterness
and
leaves
a
lingering
curry
spiciness
lightmedium
bodied
low
carbonation
certainly
an
interesting
beer
it
is
dominated
by
the
spices
i
found
it
enjoyable
but
could
see
how
some
would
not
like
it
o
i
am
going
to
go
with
a
solid
b
on
this
one
its
certainly
different
than
other
stouts
out
there
but
i
like
where
they
went
with
it
obviously
if
you
dont
like
those
flavors
this
one
could
be
offputting
to
you
a
meal
beer
between
the
spices
and
roast
flavors
it
is
more
like
food
fresh
spice
flavors
are
very
nice
lime
cocoa
interplay
is
cool
a
beer
that
is
surely
love
and
hate
between
different
people
overall
interesting
is
the
only
way
i
can
describe
this
beer
if
you
like
indian
food
you
will
like
this
beer
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
bit
of
a
strech
for
a
beer
im
happy
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
this
one
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
again
after
sampling
this
beer
a
couple
times
from
the
tap
and
then
eventually
out
of
the
bottle
it
easily
became
one
of
my
favorite
new
releases
of
2011
that
being
said
i
would
always
want
help
from
a
few
friends
when
opening
a
22oz
bottle
black
with
a
1cm
light
brown
head
medium
retention
and
light
lacing
overall
this
is
a
very
cool
amazing
different
kind
of
beer
very
well
executed
dont
drink
this
if
you
dont
like
curry
cumin
thai
and
or
indian
food
because
you
wont
like
this
its
a
great
fun
beer
a
must
try
if
you
like
these
kind
of
flavors
o
a
spicy
porter
pretty
much
what
i
figured
a
fun
beer
to
try
o
kind
of
a
funky
beeridea
decent
execution
of
it
o
this
is
good
as
a
one
off
beer
release
a
nice
experiment
if
it
was
a
regular
release
i
wouldnt
buy
it
more
than
once
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
it
was
interesting
and
decent
but
i
wouldnt
try
it
again
take
out
the
cayenne
and
this
might
be
a
completely
different
story
o
i
dont
like
this
at
all
it
does
have
some
redeeming
factors
but
i
couldnt
drink
2oz
of
this
beer
overall
a
very
unique
beer
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
a
bottle
solo
but
a
wonderful
experience
followed
it
up
with
homemade
indian
food
a
perfect
pairing
poured
into
duvel
tulip
near
black
with
brown
head
decent
retention
smell
is
heavy
on
the
cumin
and

really
get
past
the
spices

i
dont
get
any
coconut
but
a
tad
bit
of
the
lemongrass
there
is
definately
some
spicyness
here
would
not
be
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
it
is
a
fun
brew
pours

and
not
much

smell
is
lots
of
curry
spice
bakers

bitter

taste
is

turmeric
black

and
smoky

im
not
picking
up
any
of
the
supposed
coconut
in
the
smell
or
taste
nor
did
anyone
else
in
our
group
light
bodied
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
alcohol
is
not
really
noticeable
overall
bonus
points
for
the
novel
interpretation
of
the
style
this
was
actually
pretty
drinkable
despite
the
unusual
flavor
although
i
didnt
love
it
its
not
one
of
those
beers
that
you
can
only
drink
a
taste
of
im
intrigued
as
to
the
possibilities
of
food
pairings
with
this
poured
into
a
4
ounce
sample
glass
in
the
brewerys
tasting
room
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
touch
of
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
corner
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
unique
coconut
is
probably
the
most
prominent
smell
as
well
as
some
lightly
roasted
dark
malts
there
is
a
definite
spiciness
to
the
aroma
but
i
would
not
have
identified
it
as
curry
had
i
not
known
tastes
spicey
and
dry
the
curry
is
definitely
present
but
melds
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
coconut
is
pretty
big
at
9
there
is
no
surprise
that
there
is
a
significant
booziness
its
a
bit
too
boozy
to
be
very
drinkable
which
hurts
the
beer
a
bit
but
well
carbonated
and
the
strong
coconut
is
really
pleasant
to
me
definitely
a
well
crafted
beer
that
combines
flavours
i
never
expected
to
see
used
in
brewing
t
lots
of
curry
upfront
with
some
coconut
following
the
finish
brings
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
and
powdered
chocolate
i
didnt
think
this
beer
was
going
to
work
but
somehow
they
pulled
it
off
not
sure
i
would
want
a
full
pint
of
this
but
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
i
think
a
taster
is
the
correct
serving
size
for
this
beer
though
i
could
handle
up
to
a
half
pint
if
there
were
a
touch
more
coconut
very
unique
beer
which
i
would
consider
buying
ifwhen
it
gets
bottled
for
holiday
wine
cellar
bottle
slightly
sour
interesting
flavor
o
really
good
but
to
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
1
per
sitting
the
pour
is
outrageous
and
took
about
5
min
to
finish
it
actually
foamed
all
over
the
desk
like
a
mini
volcano
when
i
opened
the
bottle
lots
of
complex
flavors
to
keep
you
guessing
and
overall
a
great
beer
best
belgian
stout
i
have
ever
had
a
very
unique
stout
the
flavor
is
quite
complex
with
char
dark
dried
fruits
and
yeast
fighting
for
dominance
it
took
about
7
minutes
to
finsh
the
pour
due
to
an
explosive
head
even
with
a
gentle
pour
just
as
a
side
note
there
was
more
chunky
residue
at
the
bootom
of
this
galss
than
any
beer
ive
ever
had
overall
cheers
overall
a
good
belgian
stout
and
interesting
but
not
my
favorite
this
seems
to
have
aged
gracefully
quite
enjoyable
you
get
a
blast
of
aromas
coffee
grinds
cocoa
powder
burnt
toast
figs
prunes
and
even
a
touch
of
leather
musky
as
well
although
this
is
more
of
a
mild
background
tone
flavors
are
all
over
the
place
and
work
quite
nicely
together
smooth
and
medium
bodied
but
carbonation
is
up
there
any
more
carbonation
and
i
wouldnt
like
it
as
much
but
overall
a
good
beer
indeed
has
an
incredible
amount
of
tan
head
this
beer
has
set
in
in
my
fridge
for
sometime
and
i
cannot
believe
the
amount
of
explosive
head
that
comes
out
of
this
thing
you
would
need
a
big
gulp
if
you
wanted
to
do
an
aggressive
pour
with
this
head
finally
settles
and
begins
to
flot
with
a
12
finger
thickness
smell
is
very
strong
with
some
sweet
malt
rather
than
roast
and
sour
fruits
taste
is
less
sour
than
smell
and
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
overall
nice

dumbed
down
version

having
read
a
number
of
the
other
reviews
it
seems
like
there
is
more
variability
in
this
beer
than
what
im
generally
used
to
the
bottle
i
tried
poured
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
settled
into
a
creamy
persistent
lacing
i
got
a
big
boosey
nose
right
away
that
really
defined
this
beer
for
me
it
wasnt
unpleasant
but
rather
it
was
quite
nice
alcohol
was
up
front
in
the
taste
but
the
rest
of
the
flavor
notes
were
strong
enough
to
balance
it
well
there
was
a
sour
taste
that
set
in
fairly
quickly
and
really
distinguished
this
from
other
stouts
this
one
component
to
the
taste
added
a
lot
of
complexity
and
was
what
gave
it
the
edge
to
stand
up
to
the
alcohol
i
havent
seen
anyone
else
mention
this
and
it
makes
me
wonder
if
the
difference
in
this
bottle
came
from
the
way
it
was
handled
and
stored
before
i
bought
it
medium
body
for
a
stout
and
a
pleasant
creamy
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
would
buy
more
if
i
thought
it
would
be
consistent
bottle
date
march
2012
o
overall
this
is
a
different
beer
that
is
worth
trying
i
have
passed
this
one
by
many
times
but
finally
got
around
to
trying
it
out
of
necessity
since
i
have
enjoyed
de
dolles
other
beers
many
times
i
think
ill
stick
with
still
nacht
though
as
my
favorite
from
them
for
the
time
being
you
cannot
taste
any
of
the
alcohol
in
this
but
it
is
still
created
as
a
sipper
the
carbonation
and
the
acidity
and
bitterness
make
it
a
slow
ride
and
that
aint
a
bad
thing
very
unsessionable
sit
down
with
a
box
of
chocolates
and
drink
this
while
you
eat
or
maybe
have
it
with
some
mexicanmole
o
this
is
what
i
would
call
a
stout
and
strong
dark
ale
combo
i
think
its
really
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
a
hybrid
like
this
might
not
be
for
everyone
though
this
one
is
noteworthy
for
its
rich
head
and
bubbly
darkness
excellent
flavor
so
very
enjoyable

all

nice

flavors
and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
certainly
a
de
dolle
creation
once
again
not
your
typical
export
stout
but
quite
memorable
overall
flavors
are
very
nice
i
would
imagine
this
will
develop
more
acidity
and
to
its
detriment
even
more
carbonation
would
still
be
nice
to
let
one
of
these
sit
d
as
interesting
and
weird
as
one
would
expect
from
de
dolle
the
dark
malt
mostly
has
the
effect
of
coloring
the
yeast
character
as
dark
fruit
in
the
aroma
but
in
the
flavor
profile
it
comes
out
much
more
forcefully
as
roast
and
coffee
there
is
a
bit
of
harshness
in
all
that
roast
flavor
but
it
smooths
out
in
the
finish
as
a
little
bit
of
the
fruit
character
comes
back
in
definitely
better
than
most
belgian
stouts
i
have
tried
o
nice
beer
an
authentic
de
dolle
beer
good
quality
recommend
overall
id
say
its
pretty
decent
but
my
expectations
were
a
bit
too
high
all
in
all
a
decent
stout
ive
been
avoiding
it
for
years
a
bottle
is
plenty
at
9
my
advice
is
find
this
as
fresh
as
possible
if
you
want
to
avoid
pronounced
sour
notes
and
not
those
good
sour
notes
that
im
fond
of
o
this
one
was
ok
the
over
carbonation
really
brought
it
down
on
all
levels
i
may
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
i
just
hope
it
is
better
than
this
one
was
me
no
likey
o
interesting
beer
from
the
pointcounterpoint
of
the
malts
and
hops
very
tasty
but
point
deductions
for
extreme
head
i
would
not
buy
this
again
at
the
price
i
bought
it
but
would
definitely
not
turn
this
down
if
offered
stamp
on
the
cap
says
bottled
jun
2010
but
a
stout
with
9abv
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
there
is
plenty
of
life
left
in
this
bottle
a
very
slow
pour
results
in
a
glass
full
of
head
that
takes
twelve
minutes
for
it
to
get
to
the
point
where
i
can
drink
it
with
all
this
foam
i
expected
some
lacing
but
nope
this
looks
oily
the
nose
is
very
sweet
and
cola
smelling
hints
of
toffee
and
caramel
can
barely
squeek
thru
the
strong
alochol
aroma
taste
is
dominated
by
alochol
also
the
flavors
that
do
manage
to
be
detected
are
more
cola
like
than
stout
like
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
and
warming
almost
burning
over
carbonation
is
also
a
problem
for
me
with
this
beer
overall
i
feel
this
is
not
worth
the
7
i
paid
for
a
11
2oz
bottle
unbelievable
lightness
of
touch
for
a
9abv
beer
very
unique
there
is
a
lot
of
flavor
here
the
vinous
qualities
run
deep
the
difference
between
this
and
a
normal
imperial
stout
is
subtle
and
yeast
based
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
poured
from
33
cl
bottle
into
a
widemouthed
wine
glass
beware
to
any
trying
de
dolle
for
the
first
time
all
of
their
brews
are
extremely
lively
and
should
be
poured
very
carefully
ive
only
poured
half
the
bottle
and
upon
looking
at
the
remainder
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
foam
in
the
bottle
itself
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
as
any
stout
should
very
lively
head
that
was
a
finger
and
a
half
even
in
this
wine
glass
and
it
retains
it
well
with
limited
lacing
the
smell
is
primarily
of
belgian
yeast
but
with
hints
of
dark
malt
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
rich
and
chocolatey
but
not
too
much
so
the
mouthfeel
in
my
opinion
is
the
more
important
aspect
of
these
brews
in
short
it
is
wonderful
totally
carbonated
and
sparkling
to
keep
the
heaviness
of
the
malt
palatable
i
highly
recommend
this
or
any
of
de
dolles
other
beers
to
those
looking
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
or
even
if
you
just
want
a
damn
good
belgian
brew
overall
a
belgian
export
stout
with
good
character
unique
flavor
look
and
feel
enjoyable
but
messy
has
aging
potential
but
i
think
the
sweetness
could
take
over
if
you
put
hops
and
roast
flavor
on
opposite
sides
of
the
beer
spectrum
this
is
the
roasty
equivalent
of
a
dipa
date
on
cap
was
june
2010
i
hope
you
find
a
good
bottle
of
this
and
enjoy
very
enjoyable
taste
is
very
good
but
not
as
good
as
the
nose
overall
rating
reflects
that
this
just
slightly
warranted
a
4
tastewise
a
nice
beer
interesting
mix
of
a
bsda
and
stout
taste
is
rotten
cocoa
beans
with
a
side
of
dirt
and
old
fruit
im
guessing
this
is
bad
but
it
is
not
sour
like
most
infected
beers
i
have
had
drain
pour
and
i
will
post
this
review
merely
for
anyone
else
who
might
have
a
similar
experience
with
this
one
o
a
very
nice
fuerte
stout
has
a
zing
and
is
a
little
earthier
than
your
typical
ris
worth
a
go
pours
a
fairly
dark
black
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
that
settles
to
a
squat
cap
aromas
of
dark
malt
soy
sauce
molasses
and
dark
berry
jam
with
a
slight
touch
of
vinegar
this
is
likely
past
its
prime
taste
follows
the
nose
closely
lots
of
dark
malt
molasses
and
blackberry
jam
with
a
longlasting
bitter
finish
definitely
a
bit
oxidized
but
far
from
undrinkable
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thinner
then
expected
perhaps
due
to
the
age
about
mediumbodied
overall
with
decent
carbonation
the
abv
is
hidden
nicely
overall
a
decent
stout
but
probably
a
touch
past
its
prime
id
like
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
poursed
a
massive
all
head
with
a
muddy
mocha
brown
tinge
to
the
head
smells
great
with
caramel
and
toffee
the
taste
comes
out
more
of
a
coffee
and
cocoa
but
some
of
the
candied
aspects
are
there
too
especially
as
it
warms
pretty
high
alcohol
at
9
and
they
probably
could
have
called
this
imperial
an
interesting
bold
stout
and
im
learning
de
dolle
is
a
brewery
turning
out
top
knotch
stuff
o
not
my
favorite
stout
and
obviously
over
carbonated
but
this
had
a
good
flavor
to
it
and
was
enjoyable
enough
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
thick
black
liquid
the
head
was
almost
nonexistent
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
deeply
roasted
and
has
a
pretty
typical
belgian
yeast
aroma
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
toasted
and
burnt
with
plenty
of
malt
in
it
the
beer
was
very
dry
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thick
overall
the
beer
isnt
too
bad
there
was
a
lot
of
clumpy
sediment
that
sank
to
the
bottom
all
in
all
i
wasnt
too
bad
i
might
drink
it
again
one
day
this
is
truly
an
astounding
stout
and
one
of
the
bettercrafted
of
its
kind
that
ive
encountered
well
worth
the
effort
to
seek
out
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
was
excessively
carbonated
huge
alcohol
presence
here
felt
like
it
was
much
higher
than
the
listed
9
and
the
amount
of
carbonation
would
tell
this
continued
to
ferment
in
the
bottle
quite
a
well
rounded
brew
with
lots
of
charlike
flavoring
from
the
roast
of
the
grain
at
first
i
was
expecting
this
brew
to
be
an
infected
mess
due
to
the
amount
of
carbonation
but
it
turned
out
surprisingly
well
i
would
like
to
have
this
brew
again
overall
drinkability
is
good
as
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
creaminess
but
it
really
needed
a
little
more
body
o
quite
a
peculiar
beer
mixing
characters
from
stouts
and
strong
ales
is
sure
a
bold
attempt
which
was
partially
successful
in
my
opinion
the
beer
is
overall
very
good
though
sure
not
easy
to
drink
ode
dolle
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
them
fresh
but
age
has
really
helped
it
along
a
wonderful
offering
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
one
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
not
what
i
usually
look
for
in
a
stout
but
i
would
probably
have
this
one
again
given
the
chance
overall
as
solid
as
the
day
is
long
i
could
drink
something
like
this
all
day
the
excessive
carbonation
is
a
little
odd
in
this
style
but
that
was
my
only
gripe
and
it
is
slight
indeed
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
fantastic
and
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
you
could
easily
knock
one
or
two
of
these
back
before
regretting
it
the
next
morning
another
fantastic
beer
from
de
dollebig
surprise
overall
overall
i
found
the
beer
to
be
pretty
good
the
nice
complex
flavor
mixes
sweet
flavors
with
an
earthy
and
hoppy
aftertaste
the
only
downside
i
found
was
its
carbonation
abundance
but
id
still
recommend
trying
this
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
small
brown
head
in
the
aroma
dry
candy
sugar
a
small
roast
and
a
hint
of
coffee
in
the
taste
coffee
and
candy
sugar
stands
out
and
really
carbonated
a
carbonation
like
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
sweet
coffee
and
roasted
malt
aftertaste
quite
carbonated
but
nice
flavor
and
feels
lighter
that
9
this
beer
is
explosive
and
complex
the
flavor
goes
forever
a
really
interesting
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
high
it
definitely
felt
extremely
fizzy
for
the
style
which
i
didnt
care
for
overall
it
was
an
interesting
beer
but
it
just
didnt
work
well
for
me
too
much
carbonation
and
a
lot
of
sweet
crisp
tart
fruit
flavors
that
were
a
little
overwhelming
some
decent
flavors
but
overall
it
wasnt
that
easy
to
drink
in
the
end
i
dont
know
if
i
want
it
scaled
back
or
not
its
such
a
great
experience
of
a
beer
as
is
as
it
stands
though
i
know
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
i
would
say
that
reigning
in
some
of
the
intensity
would
make
it
a
more
drinkable
beer
but
not
necessarily
any
more
pleasant
definitely
a
great
grab
and
a
great
first
try
of
de
dolles
lineup
drink
this
was
quite
taste
unlike
a
stout
to
me
more
like
a
bsda
very
good
little
beer
i
will
have
this
one
again
from
33
cl
brown
bottle
cap
stamped
with
bottled
jan
2010
filled
to
the
absolute
top
pours
a
pitch
very
dark
brown
with
billowing
tan
styrofoam

moderate
roasted
grain
component
bitter
chocolate
buttery

earthy
leafy

a

hopping
is
earthy
with
a
tinge
of
citrus
medium
bodied
with
a
fluffy
creamy
feel
more
carbonated
than
most
nice
i
have
no
idea
about
the
style
its
a
cross
between
an
export
stout
and
a
belgium
strong
which
is
what
i
expected
this
bottle
was
bottled
jan
of
2010
so
some
age
has
taken
place
the
flavors
have
not
mixed
though
i
wonder
if
there
was
a
bit
more
hop
presence
to
start
well
worth
a
try
even
at
nearly
6
bucks
for
a
single
o
solid
beer
from
de
dolle
who
i
find
to
be
a
fairly
hit
or
miss
brewery
o
de
dolle
is
produces
quality
beer
not
sure
this
is
what
i
expected
from
a
stout
but
this
beer
rocked
it
keeps
in
line
with
de
dolles
spices
and
warm
abvs
and
didnt
disappoint
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
there
is
a
bit
of
a
tart
aftertaste
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
would
like
it
better
if
it
there
was
no
tartness
i
dont
think
the
tartness
works
real
well
when
combined
with
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
export
stout
lots
of
fruit
character
in
the
nose
and
taste
with
nice
chocolate
notes
if
you
like
this
style
then
this
beer
is
worth
picking
up
maybe
not
on
par
with
some
of
de
dolles
other
beers
but
solid
nonetheless
overall
its
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
id
get
it
on
tap
without
reservation
verdict
not
really
doing
it
for
me
but
unique
enough
that
some
will
love
it
perhaps
dark
fruit
plum
and
espresso
fudge
brownie
nutella
hazelnut
spread
dry
bakers
chocolate
lends
some
bitterness
that
compliments
the
roasty
malt
flavor
aftertaste
is
dry
and
earthy
with
traces
of
dark
roast
coffee
very
effervescent
characteristic
of
a
belgian
stout
a
few
swirls
settle
it
down
releasing
some
of
the
co2
this
was
nice
to
revisit
after
having
a
few
times
over
the
years
a
unique
beer
from
a
unique
brewery
on
tap
this
is
a
great
beer
check
it
out
if
you
see
it
havent
had
it
in
a
bottle
yet

of
roasted
dark

flavors
this
drinks
more
like
a
dark
roastier
dubbel
than
a
stout
at
first
but
after
a
short
while
the
darker
and
roasted
malts
peak
to
remind
you
that
this
was
suppose
to
be
a
stout
the
belgian
flavors
definitely
dominate
this
beer
definitely
something
worth
trying
for
the
sake
of
something
new
d
a
little
bit
stout
a
little
bit
belgian
i
like
it
while
im
glad
to
have
tried
this
brew
ill
be
fine
with
not
dropping
8
for
another
bottle
of
this
chalky
carbonated
stout
again
decent
stout
dont
know
if
its
worth
the
7
dollars
i
paid
impression
belgian
brewers
rock
when
it
comes
to
styles
started
elsewhere
dedolle
is
new
on
my
radar
gonna
be
trying
all
the
lineup
i
can
get
suggest
you
do
the
same
d
pretty
heavy
on
the
stomach
gonna
have
to
drink
slowly
d
a
potent
beer
both
alcoholically
and
flavorwise
thisd
be
tough
to
quaff
in
any
quantity
however
one
of
these
is
very
very
good
especially
in
the
doldrums
of
winter
dlike
i
said
above
this
drink
like
a
lighter
stout
it
is
so
drinkable
for
the
abv
im
very
impressed
i
wish
i
could
find
this
in
4packs
for
a
good
price
of
course
that
could
be
the
end
of
me
the
taste
and
drinkability
of
this
belgian
stout
is
quite
good
if
you
ask
me
the
taste
makes
up
for
its
okay
smell
and
disappointing
pour
a
tad
bitter
with
a
nice
overall
roasty
sensation
coffee
undertones
as
well
for
5
and
some
change
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
9
abv
to
boot
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
one
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
tartness
slight
acidity
hint
of
syrup
hint
of
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
dark
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
foreign
export
stout
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
very
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
coffee
slight
roasted
malt
slight
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
tartness
hint
of
syrup
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
good
body
and
blend
aroma
was
slightly
offputting
and
way
too
carbonated
the
ridiculous
head
and
hints
of
sourness
makes
me
wonder
about
a
possible
infection
but
maybe
this
is
the
way
the
beer
is
supposed
to
be
still
pretty
good
but
not
the
best
foreign
stout
ive
had
certainly
a
unique
belgian
take
on
the
style
very
good
flemish
stout
sorry
de
dolle
but
i
doubt
i
will
have
the
courage
to
try
another
of
your
beers
even
if
they
do
sound
good
thick
dark
tan
head
settles
to
a
18
head
light
nutty
aroma
with
some
earthy
and
winey
notes
as
well
very
carbonated
and
tingly
crisp
mouthfeel
easy
to
taste
the
belgian
twist
to
this
one
pick
up
roasted
notes
in
flavor
with
a
big
grapechampagne
flavor
as
well
big
sweetness
big
fruit
presence
for
a
stout
definitely
a
change
of
pace
from
your
typical
stout
warmth
brings
a
roasty
and
nutty
notes
to
the
flavor
carbonation
with
the
fullness
and
weight
of
flavor
makes
it
a
little
rough
in
the
beginning
but
the
warmth
seems
to
help
smooth
things
out
though
its
quite
a
twist
from
the
original
style
i
did
enjoy
trying
this
one
thanks
to
smalls
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
one
dark
brownreddish
pour
with
two
finger
caramel
colored
head
and
nice
lacing
started
spewing
foam
as
soon
as
i
cracked
the
top
and
took
a
while
to
pour
because
of
all
the
carbonation
kind
of
unusual
earthy
nutty
nose
with
hints
of
yeasty
bread
chocolate
coffee
grounds
and
a
bit
of
anise
and
cherries
and
smoke
the
taste
is
dominated
by
bitter
roasted
coffee
and
cocoa
but
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
sweet
caramel
malt
backbone
with
a
touch
of
smoke
and
dark
fruit
especially
cherries
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
and
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
excessive
at
the
beginning
but
as
it
warmed
this
beer
really
came
alive
it
was
a
bit
boozey
at
the
start
but
mellowed
nicely
and
became
really
drinkable
heading
to
essen
this
weekend
for
the
kerstbierfest
and
hope
to
pick
up
some
more
offerings
from
de
dolle
d
this
bottle
is
definitely
a
good
after
dinner
brew
very
enjoyable
as
a
dessert
i
dont
think
i
would
like
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
it
though
interesting
beer
i
might
buy
a
few
more
bottles
to
age
indefinitely
to
see
what
develops
im
pretty
sure
this
bottle
is
past
its
prime
at
least
age
wise
it
was
in
the
bargain
section
due
to
an
age
markdown
but
at
9
ill
give
it
a
go
this
one
pours
a
midnight
black
medium
bodied
with
a
three
finger
dark
khaki
head
the
smell
isnt
what
i
expected
from
a
stout
it
has
the
roasted
coffee
smell
followed
by
a
sweet
candied
fruit
aroma
possibly
raisin
its
actually
an
appealing
presence
the
taste
is
very
rich
its
a
highly
roasted
almost
smoky
flavor
with
a
slight
raisin
like
sweetness
on
the
backend
it
still
is
moderately
boozy
though
its
definitely
interesting
it
drinks
pretty
smoothly
drinking
heavier
than
it
looked
it
would
be
a
little
easier
to
drink
if
the
alcohol
wasnt
as
present
it
is
a
really
flavorful
and
solid
import
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
am
a
darkstout
beer
drinker
during
the
winter
months
and
so
this
fit
the
bill
the
beer
is
very
dark
with
a
medium
but
thick
foam
the
taste
was
full
bodied
and
had
flavor
thoughout
with
a
nice
after
taste
that
reminded
you
that
you
just
had
an
extra
stout
beer
some
belgian
beers
have
a
clovey
taste
but
this
beer
did
not
which
was
nice
next
time
i
am
in
brussels
i
will
be
looking
for
this
beer
pretty
rich
one
at
a
time
would
be
plenty
pours
a
very
carbonated
three
fingers
worth
of
caramel
brown
head
crowning
a
black
body
scents
of
tobacco
anise
and
plums
on
the
nose
that
are
echoed
on
the
taste
strong
licorice
flavor
with
a
cocoa
and
tobacco
finish
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
medium
bodied
a
more
subtle
licorice
flavor
would
have
made
this
beer
more
drinkable
poured
into
a
pint
glass
de
dolle
beers
must
all
have
obscene
carbonation
my
glass
is
full
of
thick
tan
head
and
about
an
inch
of
beer
on
the
initial
pour
once
it
starts
to
settle
down
in
the
glass
it
actually
looks
really
appealing
with
the
head
sinking
down
in
the
middle
and
leaving
a
ton
of
soapy
lace
the
initial
smell
is
full
of
belgian
yeasts
mostly
further
nose
dives
uncover
hints
of
sweet
cocoa
and
dark
cherries
the
aroma
is
also
slightly
boozy
the
taste
is
up
front
with
the
belgian
yeast
dark
fruits
bananas
and
finishes
with
slightly
bitter
espresso
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
decent
carbonation
and
the
nine
percent
abv
is
very
well
hidden
my
biggest
qualm
with
this
one
was
that
it
took
me
twenty
minutes
to
get
it
into
my
glass
well
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
so
far
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
i
might
have
to
pick
up
another
to
see
how
it
ages
the
excessive
gusher
should
have
tipped
me
off
that
this
would
be
a
highlycarbonated
beer
the
feel
is
a
bit
too
spritzy
for
the
style
i
like
my
stouts
smooth
and
creamy
albeit
heavy
this
one
is
crisp
sharp
and
bordering
on
harsh
though
it
is
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
this
lightness
allows
me
to
sip
this
with
greater
freedom
the
sourness
crosses
over
into
the
flavor
as
well
the
yeast
becomes
a
big
player
but
some
chocolate
comes
forward
as
well
i
like
the
slight
roasted
quality
it
has
but
the
sourness
becomes
tiring
after
awhile
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
thoughts
well
i
like
it
the
nose
was
the
best
part
of
it
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
an
amazing
one
it
seems
like
belgians
know
how
to
make
beer
no
matter
what
opened
with
a
very
energetic
pop
and
then
pours
with
a
really
big
foamy
head
have
to
show
patience
as
the
head
settles
to
even
try
this
one
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
slowly
settles
jeez
this
thing
almost
makes
me
feel
it
is
infected
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
dark
fruits
licorice
and
coffee
grounds
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonated
alcohol
is
fairly
prevalent
in
the
taste
along
with
some
sweetness
and
some
biterness
in
the
end
sweet
candy
fruit
taste
that
quickly
transitions
and
is
really
interrupted
by
the
carbonation
really
not
my
idea
of
a
stout
and
nothing
i
would
want
to
drink
again
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
i
cant
tell
if
this
is
how
it
is
supposed
to
taste
or
not
i
can
understand
the
high
carbonation
but
some
of
the
flavors
just
arent
good
not
to
drinkable
d
despite
the
mouthfeel
a
greater
range
of
flavor
would
have
produced
a
more
drinkable
brew
the
drinkability
is
slightly
lower
with
the
warming
and
tingly
booze
as
well
as
the
lingering
earthy
bitterness
a
slight
spicy
feel
to
it
as
well
and
its
somewhat
thick
and
syrupy
drinkability
though
the
label
states
plainly
export
stout
this
drinks
like
an
especially
dark
roast
belgian
strong
dark
ale
really
no
singular
stout
descriptors
until
the
finish
when
the
burnt
flavors
come
out
also
very
boozy
worth
a
try
but
im
not
interested
in
going
back
to
this
one
d
definitely
enjoyable
but
not
something
id
be
in
a
big
hurry
to
revisit
d
definitely
not
what
i
expected
from
this
vintage
beer
alcohol
was
still
hot
and
the
bodied
just
seems
to
have
faded
with
time
id
love
to
at
some
point
try
a
fresh
one
for
comparison
though
this
was
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
and
offered
excellent
flavor
and
aroma
qualities
that
really
made
the
beer
with
a
9
abv
you
definitely
need
to
be
careful
with
this
one
goes
awesomely
well
with
the
steak
fajitas
i
picked
up
from
a
local
eatery
and
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
a
beer
sensei
to
help
you
along
the
beer
journey
youd
be
wise
to
heed
hisher
advice
de
dolle
rarely
disappoints
and
this
is
no
exception
a
very
good
stout
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
poured
with
a
small
tan
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
color
is
an
almost
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
some
sediment
bits
aroma
is
really
big
with
the
licorice
roasty
dark
ripe
fruit
dark
roasted
coffee
malt
flavor
is
like
that
plus
has
some
sour
tang
toffee
very
bitter
dark
chocolate
body
is
a
tad
thin
good
carbonation
sharp
on
tongue
back
and
sides
almost
astringent
finish
has
the
tang
remaining
along
with
a
bit
of
the
dark
malt
in
the
throat
that
is
fairly
long
not
a
session
for
me
this
one
is
good
wont
ever
try
this
again
especially
after
having
so
many
good
belgian
stouts
like
allagash
black
or
that
one
terrapin
side
project
beer
this
is
a
worse
version
of
that
other
podge
belgian
stout
i
had
once
and
also
hated
perfect
brew
d
not
your
average
stout
but
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
actually
just
not
exactly
whats
expected
from
an
export
stout
overall
a
good
beer
but
like
their
oerbier
the
palate
lets
this
one
down
tasty
and
interesting
what
the
their
spicy
belgian
yeast
playing
a
big
role
in
this
stout
but
the
body
is
too
light
and
airy
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
too
present
and
it
burns
too
much
on
the
way
down
nevertheless
this
is
one
worth
checking
if
only
to
try
a
different
take
on
the
style
d
the
complexity
of
the
flavors
makes
this
beer
very
unique
i
would
definitely
try
this
one
again
this
is
a
beer
that
is
better
sipped
i
can
see
throwing
back
a
few
of
these
but
after
2
or
three
id
be
feeling
pretty
good
but
the
bitterness
would
engage
my
gag
reflex
which
is
accentuated
the
more
buzzed
i
am
still
its
a
crying
shame
to
have
wasted
so
much
when
opening
it
quite
tasty
i
really
enjoyed
it
but
it
does
seem
to
lack
pronounced
depth
im
pretty
sure
its
there
but
lost
in
the
lighter
brighter
bitterness
and
big
carbonation
expensive
to
have
around
but
very
good
nonetheless
d
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
just
not
what
i
wanted
i
wouldnt
see
myself
seeking
this
out
or
even
seeing
it
at
the
store
and
buying
it
again
this
just
doesnt
give
me
what
the
name
implies
overall
this
is
an
entertaining
and
unique
beer
that
i
would
try
again
drinkability
i
would
take
many
other
mass
produced
stouts
i
dont
think
i
would
pick
this
up
again
drinkability
as
i
said
this
is
a
tasty
but
inconvenient
beer
to
drink
i
rather
like
it
but
its
abv
and
some
of
the
tartness
would
wear
down
my
palate
too
much
to
really
have
more
than
one
of
these
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
one
does
well
for
a
9
bsda
d
everything
de
dolle
does
is
fantastic
would
get
this
again
this
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
style
stout
like
allagash
black
has
majority
the
characteristics
of
a
stout
but
with
small
notes
of
a
belgian
dark
ale
high
carbonation
medium
body
coffee
licorice
molasses
dark
fruits
very
little
bitters
in
this
stout
pretty
good
dacceptable
but
the
excessive
carbonation
dryness
and
lack
of
distinct
well
rounded
flavors
makes
me
glad
i
only
got
1
i
would
say
this
beer
is
well
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
nice
stout
cheers
overall
this
was
a
nice
stout
and
would
also
like
to
add
that
thankfully
there
was
no
sign
of
coffee
as
there
is
in
so
many
other
stoutsporters
these
days
d
woo
boy
a
tough
call
i
do
like
the
utter
belgianness
of
this
brew
full
of
fruit
and
spice
amidst
the
cocoastoutness
strong
beer
at
9
and
odd
flavors
made
this
one
to
linger
over
and
dont
necessarily
draw
me
back
for
another
very
worthy
of
a
try
but
be
your
own
judge
if
it
warrants
a
return
drinkability
is
good
except
for
the
carb
issue
d
this
is
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
certainly
takes
you
for
a
ride
pair
it
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
youve
got
a
nice
finish
to
a
meal
overall
kind
of
tastes
like
a
combination
of
a
russian
imperial
stout
and
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
probably
my
two
favorite
styles
so
its
kind
of
hard
for
me
not
to
like
this
the
body
is
jet
black
with
a
big
brownish
head
and
light
carbonation
the
aroma
gives
away
its
belgian
origins
straight
away
with
the
unmistakable
belgian
yeast
which
sits
alongside
roasted
dark
malts
brown
sugar
and
molasses
the
taste
is
quite
acidic
with
clear
yeastiness
and
mild
citrus
there
is
some
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
smokey
malts
but
they
sit
behind
the
feel
is
very
active
with
lots
of
carbonation
maybe
a
touch
too
much
very
interesting
beer
but
i
like
the
de
dolle
twist
on
this
stout
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
im
only
giving
it
a
3
5
because
of
the
incredibly
strong
and
lingering
aftertaste
somewhat
of
a
unique
charactera
bit
fresh
acidic
and
sweet
sour
in
character
likely
a
good
match
up
with
many
desserts
full
bodied
beer
that
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
a
must
try
beer
thank
you
greg
and
karolina
for
the
birthday
present
overall
a
great
beer
with
enough
complexity
to
make
it
interesting
and
varying
as
time
passes
but
a
little
weak
on
the
mouth
feel
im
not
sure
what
caused
the
initial
explosion
so
i
cant
count
it
against
the
beer
itself
cheers
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
ages
very
happy
to
finally
do
so
a
sort
of
contradictory
example
of
the
style
intense
yet
in
many
ways
quite
subtle
almost
too
many
elements
at
play
very
dark
black
almost
impenetrable
medium
tan
head
with
some
lacing
aroma
of
burnt
espresso
like
when
you
leave
the
coffee
pot
on
the
stove
too
long
taste
of
bitter
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
beans
with
hints
of
vanilla
chewy
mouthfeel
bitter
finish
hahahaha
it
doesnt
matter
how
slow
you
pour
this
one
you
are
going
to
get
a
full
pint
glass
of
foam
the
head
is
super
frothy
and
goopy
aroma
is
very
intense
nose
is
full
of
dark
fruit
alcohol
and
yeast
taste
is
definately
that
of
a
belgian
stout
this
is
fruity
and
metallic
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
but
nothing
too
strong
this
is
interesting
but
isnt
a
stout
there
is
an
odd
astringentness
to
it
the
feel
though
is
way
too
thin
its
not
drinakble
its
a
waste
of
money
worldclass
d
about
as
high
as
youre
going
to
get
for
a
stout
that
borders
on
imperial
d
tart
stouts
can
be
something
of
a
hit
or
miss
and
this
one
really
hits
the
mark
it
has
a
good
balance
between
roasted
sweetness
and
fruity
tartness
and
its
an
interesting
encounter
from
start
to
finish
lots
of
character
and
a
complex
composition
highly
recommended
pours
a
deep
barely
transparent
sable
that
is
chocolaty
brown
near
the
bottom
of
my
glass
mug
head
is
quite
thick
light
tan
and
rather
persistent
the
head
was
huge
with
my
first
pour
aroma
is
smoky
with
strong
coffee
and
unsweetened
chocolate
tones
as
well
as
hints
of
malt
hops
and
even
a
touch
of
fruit
mouthfilling
flavor
is
like
fine
roast
coffee
with
citrus
and
nutty
hints
and
touches
of
unsweetened
chocolate
and
caramel
simply
lipsmacking
texture
is
thick
smooth
and
fizzy
a
winner
deep
black
body
with
head
that
never
fades
seems
like
its
thick
enough
to
float
a
coin
aroma
is
a
bit
sour
but
not
from
roast
rather
something
between
chocolate
and
cherries
taste
is
comfortable
and
well
balanced
between
the
dark
dry
chocolate
malt
faint
sour
cherry
some
belgian
spice
absence
of
yeast
flavor
it
came
across
to
me
as
very
well
constructed
alcohol
is
not
present
in
any
way
but
at
9
0
its
not
a
bit
too
mild
its
an
awesome
beer
but
i
personally
look
for
a
bit
more
flavor
to
go
along
with
a
9
0
tax
on
my
sobriety
heres
a
black
espresso
like
beer
with
a
moderate
tan
head
its
aroma
is
interesting
malty
with
a
pepper
and
licorice
smell
thats
a
little
unique
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
sugary
sweetness
with
a
slight
sourness
in
the
background
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
character
along
with
the
already
mentioned
licorice
its
a
little
thinner
than
i
expected
and
has
a
bit
of
astringency
at
times
the
beer
is
quite
tasty
though
and
still
satisfying
for
a
9
beer
this
one
hides
the
alcohol
incredibly
well
pretty
good
stuff
d
this
brew
is
palatable
but
its
not
something
i
could
have
more
than
once
in
a
great
while
really
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
half
of
it
didnt
end
up
on
my
end
table
bit
that
being
said
its
a
very
nice
stout
and
for
belgian
trying
an
american
stout
style
excellent
very
good
stout
the
body
is
moderate
and
a
little
milky
leaving
it
lacking
a
bit
just
a
touch
though
overall
some
really
nice
malt
note
but
a
big
deterrent
in
the
metallicoxidation
notes
in
the
nose
and
taste
i
wish
this
one
wouldnt
have
exploded
upon
opening
i
would
love
some
more
of
this
overall
a
very
good
beer
for
having
been
picked
up
by
chance
i
wasnt
too
excited
at
firts
but
found
myself
going
back
for
more
again
and
again
i
enjoyed
it
overall
i
dont
know
im
confused
by
this
beer
go
for
it
if
youre
adventurous
but
a
sour
stout
isnt
for
me
d
the
tartness
of
this
is
does
a
good
job
of
hiding
any
of
the
alcohol
presence
still
this
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
this
is
by
no
mans
an
export
stout
but
more
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
very
unique
one
to
savor
and
enjoy
for
the
evening
but
one
that
you
enjoy
hanging
with
for
a
while
as
it
evolves
and
grows
during
the
night
when
it
comes
to
stouts
around
10
abv
i
prefer
more
complexity
and
viscosity
while
this
is
enjoyable
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
one
dimensional
for
me
had
a
bottle
with
dessert
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
pa
made
a
great
pairing
with
their
molten
chocolate
cake
like
other
big
belgian
stouts
this
is
a
subtle
beer
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
cooled
hot
chocolate
and
the
flavor
has
a
slight
sour
tang
with
a
dry
cocoa
powder
finish
it
certainly
doesnt
drink
like
a
9
beer
and
unlike
most
export
stouts
it
has
a
subtle
belgian
flair
from
a
dried
fruit
flavor
undercurrent
id
say
its
worth
a
try
note
i
had
this
later
and
did
not
review
and
i
remember
the
sour
fruity
aspects
being
much
more
muted
with
a
much
bigger
dryer
roastiness
preferred
the
complexity
of
the
first
greatly
this
score
reflects
that
first
bottle
d
please
sir
may
i
have
another
the
taste
is
superb
love
the
roasted
barley
and
heavy
molasses
taste
this
was
a
decent
stout
offering
but
i
cant
help
but
think
that
the
belgians
should
leave
stout
making
to
the
americans
and
english
very
well
balanced
dark
fruity
stout
though
heavy
with
the
head
it
doesnt
inflate
and
percolate
in
the
mouth
a
smooth
feel
that
compliments
or
is
a
result
of
the
chocolate
taste
and
aroma
nicely
done
followed
this
up
with
a

more

with

dark
chocolate
bitterness
lasts
well
into
the
roasty

somewhat
of
a

accent
mixed
with
a
woody

offers
a

in

with
some
bittering
hops
towards
the
end
lighter
bodied
than
expected
and
comes
across
more
like
a
sessionable
dark
beer

me
of
the

herbal

really
and
extraordinary
beer
i
just
wish
i
got
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
and
not
have
to
clean
my
entire
table
afterward

d
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
a
little
fruit
and
quite
unique
d
drinkability
is
not
bad
there
are
characteristics
in
this
beer
that
stand
out
to
me
as
being
very
good
unfortunately
there
are
a
few
others
that
do
more
to
run
it
in
the
ground
i
can
see
alot
of
potential
here
oh
well
glad
i
got
to
try
it
out
but
would
not
seek
it
out
agian
pours
a
very
dark
purplish
black
with
huge
foamy
beige

aroma
of

chocolate

dark
fruit

and
figs
very
carbonated

maltiness
followed
by
a
smooth
balance
of
spice
and
dark
fruit
lots
of
berry
and
fig
dry
sweet
finish
very
complex
and
quite
tasty
great
beer
ive
had
two
other
belgian
stouts
that
i
can
remember
alvinne
and
allagash
and
they
were
a
far
cry
better
than
this
complex
mess
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
finest
stouts
available
anywhere
very
drinkable
very
tasty
and
good
if
it
just
had
a
bit
more
body
it
could
be
perfect
which
means
that
i
will
keep
searching
well
its
not
something
id
likely
find
myself
craving
but
it
is
a
crafty
combination
of
earthy
stouthood
and
belgian
ambience
so
its
a
stout
with
a
split
barnyard
personality
the
abv
is
enough
to
keep
indulgence
in
intelligent
perspective
im
not
sure
it
goes
with
monday
night
football
but
its
worth
experiencing
once
or
twice
d
too
strong
and
expired
tasting
to
think
about
having
more
than
one
glad
ive
tried
it
de
dolle
makes
some
pretty
solid
beers
i
might
try
thsi
one
again
from
a
different
store
decent
for
a
stout
but
too
much
roasted
malt
for
me
also
a
bit
pricey
5
50
for
330
ml
to
me
its
not
worth
it
taste
is
very
much
the
same
theres
lots
of
carbonation
to
release
the
aromas
in
the
malt
bubbly
mouthfeel
which
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
for
me
if
my
bottle
wasnt
starting
to
turn
i
could
subtract
all
the
notes
i
wrote
about
it
being
sour
aside
from
all
the
sourness
it
was
a
great
beer
bottom
line
an
interesting
and
unusual
tasting
example
of
the
style
that
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
but
frankly
it
doesnt
work
all
that
well
for
me
too
much
tartness
and
alcohol
cut
down
on
the
drinkability
and
overall
enjoyment
of
the
brew
i
have
to
explore
this
world
of
belgian
imperial
stout
immediatly
wow
fantastic
drink
from
an
immpeccable
brewery
overall
not
really
impressed
it
takes
like
a
supped
up
guiness
with
more
alcohol
and
a
really
bitter
finish
id
like
to
try
more
belgian
stouts
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
north
america
makes
the
best
ones
stay
american
tasty
but
what
a
shame
about
the
gushing
bottle
the
beer
store
we
got
this
from
is
pretty
reputable
so
we
dont
think
this
is
a
storage
problem
verdict
excellent
beer
if
you
can
find
it
taste
is
very
sooth
roasted
with
nice
coffee
notes
the
alcohol
is
very
present
and
leaves
a
warming
feeling
in
my
throat
bitterness
is
a
combination
of
hop
and
maltbitter
and
is
spot
on
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
sticky
and
body
is
medium
the
yeast
adds
a
subtle
fruitiness
and
the
tartness
in
the
smell
is
giving
the
beer
its
extra
depth
lots
of
taste
i
would
tend
to
say
that
since
the
two
bottles
of
beer
were
stored
at
45
degrees
for
7
days
and
remained
totally
untouched
during
that
time
that
there
was
indeed
adequate
refrigeration
and
a
relative
degree
of
nonagitation
an
interesting
brew
glad
i
tried
it
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
around
d
a
good
overall
beer
that
is
very
smooth
and
light
per
style
but
still
very
well
balanced
and
brewed
this
beer
was
very
unique
ive
had
many
beers
with
wine
spirit
or
portlike
flavorsaromas
but
never
one
that
so
closely
matched
sherry
very
nice
overall
impression
a
black
dubbel
this
isnt
a
foreign
extra
stout
by
any
stretch
if
it
is
then
its
infected
and
thats
a
different
issue
it
is
enjoyable
just
not
to
style
this
one
needs
to
be
reclassified
bc
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
foreign
extra
stout
and
this
one
just
didnt
deliver
drinkability
here
is
good
but
for
safetys
sake
id
never
have
more
than
2
in
a
row
the
abv
would
melt
my
face
this
would
go
perfect
with
a
baked
ham
very
good
and
my
first
take
on
foreignexport
stouts
a
really
interesting
take
on
a
stout
and
the
de
dolle
yeast
really
shines
through
tastes
more
along
the
lines
of
a
strong
dark
belgian
rather
than
a
stout
a
lot
of
complexity
for
a
five
year
old
brew
pours
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
thick
dark
tan
head
aroma
of
dark
chocolates
malt
caramel
and
coffee
initial
taste
of
chocolate
and
coffee
sliding
into
a
medium
bitter
coffee
finish
has
vineouss
notes
as
well
high
carbonation
finish
lacks
bitterness
but
the
complexity
of
flavor
more
than
makes
up
for
it
poured
an
obnoxious
sized
head
slowly
receeding
and
leaving
sticky
lace
patches
blackish
body
smell
includes
fruit
and
spices
like
a
belgian
should
with
several
malts
including
coffee
chocolate
and
possibly
biscuit
a
little
thick
and
syrupy
body
this
beer
has
a
mix
of
malt
and
fruit
in
the
taste
coffee
malt
is
prevelant
as
it
touches
down
in
the
backbite
and
the
main
fruit
flavor
that
comes
through
is
cherry
hints
of
chocolate
and
something
like
caramel
in
the
side
round
it
out
overall
smooth
and
balanced
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
like
to
have
again
probably
the
most
impressive
head
i
have
ever
seen
even
with
a
careful
pour
the
head
seemed
to
rise
forever
the
body
was
black
and
the
head
was
brown
smells
like
bitter
cocoa
and
coffee
taste
was
cocoa
and
coffee
with
a
bit
of
hopps
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
was
impressive
also
didnt
feel
as
thick
as
i
was
expecting
and
the
carbonation
was
perfect
an
interesting
though
pricey
about
six
bucks
for
an
11
2
oz
bottle
belgian
stout
as
far
as
i
can
recall
this
is
the
first
belgian
stout
ive
tasted
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
although
once
it
warmed
it
didnt
seem
too
far
off
from
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
price
would
be
the
only
thing
holding
me
back
from
buying
again
and
often
thank
you
de
dolle
served
in
my
dfh
snifter
poured
an
opaque
black
rocky
tan
colored
head
started
at
the
taper
of
the
snifter
and
ended
at
the
lip
of
the
glass
this
was
my
second
gusher
of
the
day
though
before
eventually
settling
into
a
quarter
inch
consistent
skim
of
foam
and
ringlets
lots
of
sticky
lacing
coated
the
glass
during
each
sip
however
adhesion
was
somewhat
weak
leaving
only
a
bit
of
residue
after
each
sip
scent
was
not
at
all
what
i
expected
prunes
and
a
subtle
scent
of
cocoa
more
dark
fruit
flavors
in
the
mouth
prunes
and
cherries
with
a
somewhat
tart
character
particularly
at
the
finish
cocoa
flavors
were
much
more
pronounced
in
the
mouth
than
in
the
nose
lively
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
mediumbodied
texture
drinkability
was
quite
good
for
a
9
abv
brew
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
consistency
was
solid
enough
for
the
style
without
being
overwhelming
all
and
all
a
very
pleasant
tasting
experience
mouthfeel
is
waaay
too
heavy
on
the
carbonation
makes
it
hard
to
drink
drinkability
not
quite
complex
to
warrant
the
strength
in
my
opinion
but
this
is
still
quite
a
nice
beer
it
is
fiery
but
its
also
balanced
in
a
way
d
my
first
and
only
beer
from
brouwerij
de
dolle
brouwers
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
an
export
stout
interesting
belgian
take
on
a
stout
i
love
the
spicy
belgian
yeastiness
and
the
cherrydark
fruit
flavors
good
stuff
drinkability
a
very
good
sipping
belgian
started
drinking
with
the
meal
but
finished
it
as
a
digestive
would
definitely
have
this
one
again
man
this
is
definitely
not
the
beer
for
me
ordered
at
the
brickstore
in
atlanta
this
beer
looks
better
than
it
tastes
after
that
its
all
downhill
taste
is
ridiculously
sour
unfortunately
i
couldnt
get
past
that
aspect
on
top
of
the
sour
taste
the
beer
was
so
effervescent
it
was
almost
undrinkable
i
could
see
where
some
people
might
like
this
as
for
me
i
had
to
send
it
back
poured
a
33cl
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
this
beer
pours
a
jet
black
that
barely
lets
any
light
through
it
has
a
huge
dark
beige
head
that
turns
into
about
a
half
an
inch
of
frothy
goodness
for
the
entirety
of
the
beer
it
leaves
a
sticky
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
interesting
the
first
aroma
is
really
strong
coffee
if
you
have
ever
walked
by
a
local
coffee
shop
that
roasts
their
own
beans
thats
the
aroma
bitter
chocolate
is
also
pretty
prevalent
the
odd
part
of
the
aroma
is
a
big
sour
aspect
definite
notes
of
sour
pie
cherries
and
granny
apple
skin
the
taste
is
awesome
huge
roasted
malts
coffee
granny
apples
and
sour
cherries
there
is
almost
no
sweetness
to
this
beer
at
all
the
sourness
that
is
so
prevalent
is
almost
like
an
american
wild
ale
toned
down
the
finish
is
like
eating
pure
cocoa
this
beer
is
bitter
and
sour
in
an
excellent
way
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
pretty
carbonated
this
is
an
awesome
beer
definitely
one
to
pick
up
the
next
time
your
at
your
local
bottle
shop
poured
from
33cl
bottle
into
a
new
belgium
snifter
poured
a
midnight
black
with
a
super
thick
brown
head
great
lacing
the
head
of
the
beer
was
the
thickest
i
have
ever
seen
on
a
stout
with
this
high
of
an
abv
smell
is
roasted
malt
smell
with
some
dark
fruit
and
an
alcohol
background
taste
is
bitter
coffee
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
fullbody
but
highly
carbonated
and
prickly
cant
say
that
i
could
drink
boats
load
of
this
one
but
i
think
and
heard
that
this
one
ages
very
well
overall
its
fun
to
try
new
beers
but
sometimes
it
doesnt
work
out
like
with
this
one
an
aggresive
pour
leaves
a
thick
dark
tan
head
which
stays
but
no
lingering
lace
the
beer
is
thick
like
motor
oil
smells
of
burnt
toffee
slight
fruitiness
and
dark
roast
coffee
some
bitter
cocoa
as
well
first
taste
is
a
tad
overwhelming
a
lot
of
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
almost
a
sour
note
at
the
mid
point
must
be
the
yeast
the
pour
took
so
long
i
kicked
up
a
lot
of
yeast
the
after
taste
leaves
a
bit
of
that
sourness
the
same
type
of
sour
i
get
from
espresso
but
a
very
slight
hoppiness
as
well
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
vinous
almost
port
like
defintely
better
warm
the
taste
is
very
sweet
almost
cloyingly
its
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
as
well
especially
for
a
stout
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
seems
a
bit
overdone
for
my
first
belgian
stout
it
was
pretty
good
but
not
fantastic
pours
a
very
dark
with
a
tannish
head
flavor
is
sweet
and
sticky
lots
of
sugar
but
not
a
lot
of
real
firm
stout
character
coming
in
the
problem
here
seems
to
be
a
seriously
high
carbonation
element
it
definitely
is
interfering
with
my
perception
of
flavor
hopefully
this
is
an
exception
and
not
the
rule
this
is
nice
but
the
carbonation
is
really
killing
it
d
have
one
with
dinner
and
one
for
dessert
a
very
unique
beer
that
i
cant
really
compare
to
anything
that
i
have
had
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
but
there
are
other
de
dolle
beers
that
i
love
more
than
this
still
well
done
d
creamy
and
smooth
full
of
flavor
and
a
work
of
art
not
my
favorite
stout
but
a
surprise
and
worthy
entry
into
the
category
from
the
belgiums
oelergud
this
like
a
belgian
dark
ale
crossed
with
a
stout
lots
of
yeast
esters
going
on
in
here
11
2
oz
bottle
purchased
for
4
99
from
garys
in
madison
white
de
dolle
logo
sticker
with
9
alcvol
and
refermented
in
the
bottle
on
the
print
the
appearance
was
outstanding
a
gargantuan
foamy
head
spilled
over
my
serving
cup
and
lingered
for
a
bit
with
a
tan
and
red
color
a
mahoganybrown
hue
dominated
this
serving
with
a
rich
aroma
of
cocoa
dehydrated
fruits
and
strong
noticeable
espresso
smells
taste
strongly
resembled
the
aroma
with
roasted
malts
slight
vanilla
caramel
figs
and
prunes
bursting
through
with
an
extra
creamy
rich
and
thick
mouthfeel
this
beer
went
down
very
easily
and
was
extremely
drinkable
with
the
rather
hefty
9
abv
hardly
noticeable
at
all
behind
rich
dark
lattee
and
strong
coffee
flavors
that
dominated
the
full
flavor
and
character
of
this
rich
beer
another
excellent
sample
from
de
dolle
this
sample
was
filling
and
rich
without
being
overbearing
or
too
cloying
good
stuff
definitely
recommended
very
impressive
pours
black
with
an
impressive
looking
huge
head
that
is
a
cofffee
with
cream
color
the
head
sticks
aaround
for
a
awhile
too
smells
of
dusty
cocoa
a
touch
of
sour
something
grainy
and
a
bit
sour
like
roasted
grain
can
be
as
well
this
is
distinct
from
the
other
slightly
funky
sourness
also
drifting
around
in
the
aromas
there
is
almost
a
soapiness
at
the
end
the
taste
is
much
more
robust
than
the
aroma
starts
slightly
sour
then
transitions
into
big
roasty
chocolatey
flavors
with
a
hint
of
licorice
and
an
herbal
finish
somewhat
unusual
even
for
a
belgian
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
big
viscous
slick
and
creamy
even
thought
is
very
big
and
somewhat
alcoholic
tasting
the
abv
is
still
pretty
well
concealed
also
the
herbal
bitterness
in
this
one
cuts
right
through
the
mouthcoating
flavors
to
make
it
more
drinkable
while
the
slight
sourness
lightens
the
flavors
as
well
the
sour
start
ffollowed
by
the
roasty
chocolatey
flavors
to
me
is
the
hallmark
of
belgian
style
stouts
i
really
think
its
time
to
add
this
as
a
new
category
on
ba
d
not
to
great
and
wouldnt
really
say
its
to
true
to
the
style
this
is
for
sure
a
belgian
strong
ale
and
not
a
stout
with
that
in
mind
it
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
complex
and
well
balanced
from
start
to
finish
wow
this
was
a
very
different
stout
indeed
it
tastes
like
a
stout
mixed
with
a
sparkling
white
wine
champagne
very
refreshing
and
complex
and
yet
it
manages
to
pack
in
a
whopping
9
abv
this
is
another
fine
brew
from
de
dolle
and
it
gets
my
recommendation
for
sure
big
roasted
malt
fruity
ester
nose
huge
carbonation
and
huge
head
nice
woody
flavors
from
the
malts
nugget
hops
rich
coffee
chocolately
alcohol
warmth
no
harsh
hot
alcohol
i
would
have
been
fooled
if
someone
told
me
this
was
lightly
barrel
aged
nice
and
dry
for
the
style
which
is
surprising
because
this
runs
right
up
into
imperial
stout
category
without
venturing
too
far
into
that
realm
the
only
real
thing
i
can
ding
this
one
on
is
the
overcarbonation
but
with
belgian
yeast
strains
you
kinda
expect
it
let
is
sit
in
the
glass
and
warm
up
and
vent
carbonation
and
it
keeps
getting
better
and
better
bonus
points
for
having
such
a
great
label
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
bite
is
extreme
all
and
all
this
beer
has
some
flaws
that
are
hard
to
overlook
less
black
malt
a
tad
more
body
and
lower
carbonation
would
make
this
a
great
beer
just
as
people
said
in
other
reviews
this
beer
turns
into
a
foam
monster
once
it
hits
the
glass
after
almost
5
minutes
i
was
able
to
get
most
into
the
glass
with
minimal
overflow
the
head
was
a
huge
mahogany
pillow
of
foam
the
color
was
a
deep
brownblack
color
the
smell
was
of
coffee
and
the
taste
was
of
bitter
chocolate
and
deeply
roasted
barley
i
found
this
beer
to
be
too
distracting
due
the
overcarbonation
and
a
bit
heavy
with
the
alcohol
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
tried
a
belgian
stout
but
would
probably
stick
with
the
more
traditional
makers
in
the
future
this
is
probably
the
56th
time
ive
had
this
brew
over
the
last
few
years
and
my
notes
all
say
the
same
thing
overcarbonated
needs
more
body
too
much
alchol
etc
that
being
said
it
is
way
better
than
the
belgian
ris
i
had
last
night
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
being
able
to
try
allagashs
attempt
at
a
belgian
style
ris
i
bet
its
a
world
better
however
now
that
ive
actually
rated
this
one
i
will
probably
buy
35
for
the
cellar
to
try
down
the
road
but
the
bottle
conditioning
is
not
going
to
help
the
overcarbonation
as
for
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
slowly
but
could
not
make
a
session
out
of
it
it
is
a
reasonably
good
brew
just
not
sure
it
fits
in
the
stout
category
be
careful
pouring
this
one
poured
into
a
stella
goblet
and
all
but
just
an
inch
at
the
bottom
was
a
khaki
colored
head
more
bubbly
towards
the
bottom
more
foamy
at
the
top
it
took
me
about
10
minutes
to
empty
the
whole
bottle
into
the
glass
after
it
all
settles
a
thin
layer
covers
this
black
brew
smell
is
very
sweet
definite
belgian
yeast
smell
some
alcohol
tangy
is
a
good
word
to
describe
this
beer
both
in
taste
and
in
smell
lots
of
alcohol
in
the
taste
as
well
nice
roasted
character
somewhere
back
there
but
its
almost
completely
overpowered
the
rest
of
it
mouthfeel
eeeh
overcarbonated
for
sure
and
it
bites
a
highly
unique
beer
that
isnt
a
stout
if
you
were
looking
for
a
stout
or
even
a
twist
on
a
common
stout
this
isnt
it
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
with
belgian
quirks
pours
up
an
opaque
deepest

with
a
massive
meringuey
light
brown
head
that
stays
around
for
a
good
minute
or
so
nice

and
stickage
aromas
range
from
a
light
dusty
funk
to
cocoacarobchocolate
with
a
light
grassiness
underneath
belgian
yeast
character
shines
throughout
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
roastiness
in
the
taste
compared
to
most
stouts
but
its
there
citric
and
tart
with
fruitness
lingering
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
light
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
heavy
a
healthy
carbonation
keeps
this
in
check
its
always
nice
to
try
stouts
from
belgium
because
they
retain
some
stoutlike
qualities
but
are
uniquely
belgian
poured
into
a
tulip
a
nice
dark

color
nice
carbonation

nice
big

i
really
like
this
brew
highly
recommended
i
have
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
this
brewery
and
most
have
been
very
good
this
one
easily
qualifies
as
very
good
it
may
not
be
everyones
cup
of
tea
but
its
definitely
mine
despite
the
4
49
price
tag
a
multiple
bottle
purchase
is
in
my
future
extra
export
stout
is
extra
good
a
driknable
but
not
necessarily
extraordinary
brew
given
the
price
wouldnt
mind
having
another

should
the
opportunity
present

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
ia
my
notes
got
a
bit
sparser
as
this
was
the
last
beer
of
my
evening
but
i
clearly
remember
the
opaqueness
of
this
beer
aroma
was
of
licorice
and
was
a
bit
musty
flavor
was
extremely
grapey
and
the
beer
had
a
very
dry
mouthfeel
much
like
a
very
astringent
cabernet
not
bad
black
with
a
thick
dark
tan
head
smells
of
something
like
a
cross
between
raisins
and
grapes
java
toffee
chocolate
and
sweet
bread
tastes
the
same
with
a
nice
alcohol
finish
just
dry
and
bitter
enough
creamy
but
not
like
drinking
syrup
nice
little
carb
reaction
when
it
goes
in
and
down
great
dessert
i
have
a
pint
glass
and
it
took
me
three
pours
to
finish
the
11
2oz
bottle
that
should
tell
you
how
much
suds
are
here
d
intriguing
but
not
very
sessionable
an
outstanding
dessert
beer
one
i
would
reccommend
to
anyone
who
likes
theirt
stouts
flavorful
andor
boozy
not
really
a
session
beer
and
probably
not
something
to
pair
with
food
besides
chocolate
but
its
great
at
the
conclusion
of
a
robust
threebeer
meal
and
would
probably
make
an
excellent
nightcap
im
sure
ill
have
this
again
but
one
is
enough
for
tonite
this
one
is
very
interesting
very
complex
but
at
the
end
i
have
to
admit
that
im
a
little
disappointed
with
this
one
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
maybe
ill
try
it
again
another
time
to
see
if
i
have
another
feeling
on
another
day
cheers
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
for
its
size
and
character
but
its
still
definitely
a
sipper
d
a
complex
ale
with
many
strengths
at
9
it
has
the
potential
for
havoc
so
moderation
is
in
order
it
is
subtle
with
nuance
and
can
creep
up
with
deceptive
grace
pleasing
in
aroma
and
taste
could
be
the
quaffaable
9
dark
ale
i
have
tasted
d
this
beer
has
great
malt
flavor
and
complexity
and
qualities
from
the
yeast
really
add
more
depth
to
the
malt
this
is
a
great
fusion
of
british
stout
and
belgian
yeast
looks
like
liquid
chocolate
pouring
out
of
the
bottle
topped
by
a
slightly
overenthusiastic
head
that
maintains
its
presence
aromas
are
fantastic
notes
of
coffee
black
cherries
cocoa
and
molasses
dominate
over
the
slightly
spicyyeast
notes
flavor
is
slightly
sour
up
front
with
great
espresso
and
deep
rich
dark
chocolate
notes
on
the
finish
slight
alcohol
warmth
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
before
the
palate
dries
out
like
dayold
bread
theres
juts
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
there
as
well
really
an
unusual
flavor
profile
but
i
like
it
a
lot
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
an
export
stout
but
not
surprising
from
a
belgian
offering
drinkability
is
also
very
good
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
i
nice
brew
a
bit
pricey
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
this
is
a
unique
belgian
beer
that
has
great
flavor
but
the
high
alcohol
is
noticeable
pushing
this
down
in
the
category
great
beer
on
tap
at
roughly
4
a
bottle
this
isnt
an
anytime
beer
but
it
is
surely
something
to
be
revisited
from
time
to
time
drinkability
is
only
ok
for
this
one
i
prefer
more
coffee
and
chocolate
in
an
ris
drinkability
i
could
drink
about
a
case
of
this
stuff
if
i
had
more
livers
this
is
ale
is
definitely
belgian
first
and
a
stout
second
that
being
said
it
is
unlike
any
other
belgian
ive
sampled
in
other
examples
of
belgianstout
hybrids
ive
tried
the
flavors
simply
dont
meld
but
thats
not
the
case
here
another
masterpiece
from
the
mad
bros

both
the
stout
and
belgian
level
of
things
ive
found
the
same
qualities
in
this
one
as
i
have
in
my
other
de
dolle
experiences
interesting
and
different
recommended
was
able
to
give
this
brew
a
try
the
other
night
as
i
saw
another
patron
have
one
the
brew
was
very
active
as
far
as
carbonation
goes
no
matter
how
careful
and
slowly
i
poured
it
there
was
an
incredible
amount
of
dark
brown
head
the
pour
took
about
5
minutes
to
let
things
come
down
repour
more
in
etc
once
i
was
able
to
finally
get
the
brew
into
a
glass
it
was
a
nice
looking
brew
black
as
night
with
a
thick
chunky
dark
brown
head
that
had
very
good
retention
and
left
a
ton
of
thick
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
nice
had
clear
stout
aromas
of
chocolate
coffee
roasted
nuts
mixed
together
with
dark
fruit
and
a
earthy
scent
i
would
imagine
i
could
give
more
insight
to
the
aroma
but
this
is
what
i
clearly
remember
last
evening
the
taste
was
great
thick
feel
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
that
tingles
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
flavors
where
in
line
to
what
was
experienced
in
the
nose
but
also
with
the
taste
of
candy
mixed
with
a
peppery
taste
the
end
seems
quite
dry
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
and
one
i
am
glad
to
have
given
a
try
this
is
my
first
introduction
to
de
dolle
but
now
i
must
get
out
and
find
more
this
is
the
type
of
brew
that
you
want
to
slowly
sip
while
hanging
out
with
friends
which
we
where
doing
or
while
sitting
and
relaxing
a
slow
drinker
to
really
take
in
its
properties
and
characteristics
low
appearance
just
due
to
the
difficulty
of
the
pour
will
change
it
if
my
next
foray
is
better
besides
that
it
was
the
high
light
of
the
evening
drinkabilityoverall
this
is
a
great
beer
regardless
of
style
or
country
of
origin
was
expecting
less
stout
character
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
such
a
solid
milksweet
stout
base
with
the
substantial
booze
comes
off
as
a
lighter
dfh
world
wide
stout
yummy
poured
into
tumbler
at
50
degrees
beer
was
black
thick
and
when
i
opened
it
the
head
tried
to
leap
out
of
the
bottle
once
in
the
tumbler
beer
kept
a
fantastic
thick
head
that
exuded
strong
black
coffee
tast
was
also
strong
for
me
very
chocolate
very
high
alc
taste
also
and
just
a
slight
sour
note
i
think
most
stout
people
will
like
but
a
little
heavy
for
me
so
will
not
purchase
again
drinkability
a
very
nice
and
tasty
stout
pours
a
deep
rich
midnight
black
topped
by
a
thick
creamy
brown
head
thats
going
nowhere
fast
aroma
of
rich
roasted
malt
a
touch
of
lactose
and
a
strong
underlying
mustiness
in
a
good
funky
belgian
way
palate
is
roasted
malt
up
front
with
a
flash
of
lactose
sweetness
emerging
after
just
a
second
it
passes
just
as
quickly
with
a
light
hoppy
bitterness
taking
its
place
the
malt
takes
center
stage
again
on
the
swallow
with
some
mellow
notes
of
dark
fruit
peeking
through
on
the
finish
body
is
rich
and
smooth
but
a
bit
foamy
it
youre
not
careful
a
delightful
stout
that
is
a
nice
surprise
from
a
belgian
brewery
a
lovely
beer
taste
was
all
coffee
and
chocolate
and
a
pleasant
balance
between
dry
and
sweet
alcohol
very
well
hidden
giving
this
one
a
high
drinkability
score
some
ear
warming
on
bigger
sips
body
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
a
stout
which
i
didnt
like
that
much
but
not
a
huge
deal
d
as
usual
de
dolle
doesnt
disappoint
drinks
very
well
for
a
beer
with
this
much
punch
pours
dark
chocolate
brown
with
really
big
nearly
half
a
glass
chunky
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
lace
the
aroma
coming
off
the
beer
is
a
little
thin
sweet
malts
cocoa
and
spicy
alcohol
taste
is
something
else
however
the
mouth
is
quickly
enveloped
in
sweet
raisin
and
plum
flavors
these
are
in
turn
replaced
by
an
alcoholic
carob
cocoa
powder
and
caramel
center
the
finish
becomes
super
dry
with
touches
of
hops
and
loads
of
coffee
malt
chocolate
malt
and
burnt
toast
body
is
moderate
to
heavy
with
some
oily
slickness
and
many
small
bubbles
another
great
offering
from
de
dolle
d
the
unbalance
in
the
mouth
doesnt
help
it
overall
decent
but
not
great
drinkability
overall
i
like
the
smoky
rosted
feel
of
this
stout
as
well
as
its
strong
but
not
overpowering
bitterness
one
of
my
first
beers
in
this
style
overall
very
good
and
would
enjoy
again
drink
yes
very
good
drinkability
this
is
an
odd
little
number
of
a
brew
i
was
taken
aback
at
first
by
the
oddness
but
then
warmed
up
to
it
as
i
drank
it
still
the
almosthybrid
of
a
stout
and
a
belgian
strong
dark
may
turn
some
people
off
and
with
that
id
suggest
not
serving
this
in
a
pint
glass
but
something
smaller
and
more
containable
and
for
6
a
bottle
this
is
certainly
something
i
wouldnt
make
a
habit
of
drinking
drinks
okay
but
after
a
while
the
9
abv
catches
up
to
you
not
the
best
of
this
style
but
not
bad
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
not
bubbly
carbonation
just
the
perfect
amount
at
9
this
one
could
take
its
toll
after
a
few
but
the
alcohol
is
never
a
burden
nicely
balanced
and
a
very
pleasant
brew
overall
very
reminiscent
of
a
ris
with
a
slightly
thinner
mouthfeel
notes
of
coffee
and
cream
with
a
nicely
bitter
backbone
coupled
with
some
cherry
cordial
chocolate
and
all
alcohol
is
hardly
noticeable
in
the
finish
an
excellent
beer
and
perhaps
the
first
belgian
stout
ive
had
pours
a
dark
brown
but
not
opaque
ridicules
carbonation
leads
to
a
huge
head
of
large
brown
bubbles
heavy
alcohol
presence
in
the
aroma
i
feel
drunk
just
smelling
this
one
light
mix
of
sweetness
and
toasted
malt
in
the
background
taste
is
a
mix
of
sherry
and
toasted
malt
very
nice
balance
of
the
two
alcohol
is
more
subdued
in
the
flavor
but
is
still
present
as
i
drink
the
alcohol
aroma
fades
but
is
still
noticeable
aftertaste
is
rather
smooth
with
a
bitterburnt
tone
an
interesting
take
on
a
stout
i
am
feeling
every
bit
of
the
9abv
on
this
one
a
bit
like
unibroues
terrible
but
better
my
next
closest
proximation
the
alchemists
knuckel
dragger
jeez
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
of
course
its
a
bold
and
agressive
stout
but
thats
just
the
beginning
very
big
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
with
a
solid
caramel
nutty
flavor
throw
in
some
lactose
for
extra
sweetness
and
smoother
texture
but
then
the
belgian
stuff
starts
add
some
grape
figs
prunes
blackberries
and
candy
sweetness
really
projects
tartness
and
sourness
withouut
detracting
from
the
stoutlike
character
strongly
stout
and
belgian
from
nose
to
finish
moderately
heavy
without
thickening
the
texture
strong
coffee
and
berry
finish
and
lingering
this
beer
was
a
lot
of
fun
reminds
me
of
some
great
baltic
porters
this
beer
pours
a
remarkably
dark
brown
color
hardly
any
light
gets
through
even
when
the
glass
is
tipped
up
on
its
edge
the
smell
is
strong
with
the
most
dominant
smell
being
alcohol
there
is
a
hint
of
chicory
as
well
the
smell
is
huge
the
alcohol
whiffs
down
your
throat
as
you
swallow
it
and
really
takes
over
the
initial
25
of
the
beer
when
the
rest
of
it
kicks
in
its
mostly
a
smokey
chicory
flavor
the
last
half
is
the
best
balanced
part
of
the
whole
beer
when
the
two
are
married
together
and
go
down
very
easily
33
cl
belgian
bottleconditioned
with
no
freshness
date
it
pours
quite
black
that
at
first
is
three
inches
of
yellowkhaki
head
to
one
and
a
half
inches
of
beer
as
i
fit
more
into
the
chalice
it
becomes
thick
and
craggy
and
retains
a
halfinch
cap
that
leaves
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
intoxicating
with
dark
chocolate
cocoa
creamy
milk
raisins
currants
grapes
lightly
vinous
malts
pink
grapefruit
strawberry
and
a
light
acidity
along
with
pineyleafy
and
citrictropical
hops
there
are
deep
malt
flavors
coffee
acidity
roastedcharred
malts
along
with
a
medium
green
hop
bitterness
that
ebbs
and
flows
on
top
of
a
thick
and
chewy
body
that
manages
to
move
lightly
across
the
tongue
leaving
a
long
finish
overall
a
great
stout
i
think
im
in
love
d
well
the
beer
started
on
a
bad
note
and
never
really
redeemed
itself
i
dont
like
that
sour
taste
that
some
dark
beers
get
it
tastes
unplanned
and
tainted
the
beer
wasnt
bad
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
us
stouts
not
so
drinkable
i
have
neither
the
desire
nor
the
ability
to
consume
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
think
aging
this
one
a
couple
of
years
might
produce
better
results
pours
nearly
completely
pitch
black
with
a
monsterous
tan
head
be
careful
with
the
pour
because
if
you
pour
too
fast
like
i
did
you
will
have
to
wait
a
few
minutes
for
the
head
to
die
down
just
to
finish
pouring
the
rest
of
the
bottle
into
the
glass
first
go
around
i
got
13
beer
and
23
head
aroma
consists
of
dark
fruits
chocolate
and
cookie
dough
the
aroma
definately
lets
you
know
this
brew
is
belgian
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
way
too
much
carbonation
in
my
opinion
negatively
affecting
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
taste
is
chocolatey
nutty
and
roasty
alcohol
is
definately
present
overall
an
interesting
brew
but
not
worth
the
4
59
price
tag
to
purchase
again
i
dont
normally
have
a
problem
with
the
higher
abvs
as
long
as
they
are
done
properly
overall
id
have
to
pass
on
this
one
again
what
is
the
deal
with
the
shitty
luck
ive
been
having
with
belgians
lately
i
guess
when
youre
used
to
drinking
tasty
fresh
stuff
from
new
belgium
avery
goose
island
and
unibroue
it
changes
your
expectations
it
may
be
a
bold
statement
but
this
beer
cements
my
opinion
that
north
american
brewers
have
surpassed
belgium
from
where
i
live
and
what
i
can
drink
does
not
taste
like
any
stout
that
i
know
has
stoutlike
characteristics
but
is
very
belgian
trippel
quad
quint
not
my
style
but
a
nice
change
i
really
liked
this
one
the
ashcoffee
in
the
flavor
is
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
absolutely
loving
this
beer
too
bad
this
one
actually
reminds
me
of
something
i
just
brewed
not
too
long
ago
a
belgian
bourbon
oak
imperial
milk
stout
without
the
bourbon
lactose
and
oak
of
course
looking
this
up
i
found
many
similarities
in
fact
including
many
of
the
same
malts
used
close
to
the
same
og
even
used
some
nugget
hops
in
the
aromatics
that
came
about
a
total
of
53
ibuscalculated
i
used
the
westmalle
strain
that
john
at
john
harvards
wayne
gave
me
i
did
use
over
a
pound
of
lactose
though
in
mine
and
they
used
candi
sugar
many
similarities
by
my
own
estimation
without
knowing
much
about
this
one
until
now
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
full
bodied
but
not
unto
the
point
of
chewyness
the
beer
has
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
normal
for
export
stouts
the
beer
is
a
pure
delight
to
drink
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
stop
myself
from
drinking
the
other
bottle
in
my
cellar
this
is
a
beer
that
will
make
frequent
stays
in
my
pint
glass
who
would
have
thought
that
a
belgian
stout
would
be
like
this
the
mad
brewers
of
course
would
make
such
a
stout
a
tad
bit
too
high
on
the
carbonation
more
reflective
of
a
belgian
than
a
stout
other
than
that
the
explosive
head
aside
this
is
a
very
well
done
beer
and
a
nice
stout
overall
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
fun
beer
to
taste
and
one
id
recommend
trying
this
beer
is
an
english
style
done
with
a
belgian
flair
cool
interpretation
of
this
style
comments

i
cellared
this
2004
vintage
in
justright
conditions
and
boy
oh
boy
did
that
pay
off
two
years
down
was
perfect
for
this
stout
a
unique
stout
that
is
highly
drinkable
i
believe
that
the
bottle
i
purchased
may
have
been
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
given
my
intital
impressions
i
will
certainly
look
for
another
why
o
why
dont
they
sell
sixers
of
this
at
walmart
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
because
id
love
to
introduce
this
to
my
friends
this
is
one
great
alcoholic
stout
and
one
to
look
for
thanks
to
mike
brawley
for
convincing
me
to

this
one
wow
nelly
what
a
beer

brew
has
a
monster
head
good
lord
the
head
is
so
thick
and
huge
you
could
use
it
as
the
foundation
of
a
house
is
this
a
milk
shake
it
looks
absolutely
beautiful
in
a
a
pint
glassexceptional
the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
very
nice
roasted
malts
with
a
gentle
bitterness
at
such
a
high
alcohol
level
it
is
amazing
that
there
is
no
alcohol
tatse
what
so
ever
a
clean
and
pleasing
mouthfeel
a
very
highly
drinkable
brew
without
a
doubt
i
have
found
a
new
best
friend
search
for
this
ale
and
enjoy
d
high
very
tasty
and
easy
to
throw
back
a
good
stout
its
fun
to
see
how
the
belgians
do
stouts
just
as
im
sure
they
think
its
fun
to
see
how
we
do
americans
very
complex
with
all
the
roasted
malt
flavors
as
well
as
esters
and
hop
contributions
very
dark
brown
chestnut
highlights
it
poured
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
that
fell
quickly
but
left
a
bit
of
clumpy
lace
behind
chocolatey
lightly
roasted
aroma
a
bit
bready
sweet
roasty
milk
chocolate
with
moderate
bitterness
and
fruit
a
bit
acidic
and
salty
in
the
finish
some
spice
as
well
some
alcohol
warmth
as
well
creamy
texture
full
body
and
a
bit
dry
from
the
roasted
barley
an
interesting
stout
thanks
hogtownharry
overall
a
very
interesting
and
quite
enjoyable
take
on
a
stout
by
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
brewers
defintelty
worth
a
try
a
truely
different
beer
in
the
stout
style
pours
out
similar
to
a
dr
pepper
thin
blackness
produces
a
thin
head
of
tan
foam
high
level
of
carbonation
for
this
style
no
lace
aromas
of
sweet
malts
chocolate
grain
berries
cinnamon
and
pepper
amazing
great
aroma
taste
not
so
wonderful
high
carbonation
attacks
the
tongue
and
flavors
of
berries
sweet
chocolate
malts
and
thin
husk
flavors
fill
the
mouth
alcohol
becomes
present
and
provides
a
warming
note
carmel
and
coffee
hints
linger
in
the
background
definite
belgian
yeast
character
as
well
would
be
much
better
if
it
werent
so
sweet
mouthfeel
was
overly
bubbly
and
excited
lacked
real
depth
and
thickness
but
was
interesting
and
playfully
enjoyable
drinkability
is
average
a
cross
between
a
carbonated
soft
drink
and
a
stout
unique
worth
a
try
i
think
de
dolle
might
be
my
favorite
belgian
brewery
would
not
recommend
this
to
stout
purists
but
this
is
a
fun
one
with
as
much
character
as
any
other
big
stoutbut
different
from
most
others
too
looking
forward
to
next
time

more
than
one
theres
a
lot
going
on
but
not
all
of
it
i
enjoy
seems
kind
of
twitchy
like
the
flavors
change
too
quickly
strange
brew
overall
a
pricey
stout
but
an
interesting
one
thats
definitely
worth
finding
to
try
why
am
i
reviewing
stouts
at
room
temperature
mainly
because
i
am
away
from
home
and
the
hotel
has
a
very
cold
minifridge
as
my
other
option
but
also
because
i
believe
a
good
stout
will
do
well
at
warmer
temperatures
possibly
better
than
at
50f
drinkability
is
only
hampered
a
bit
for
me
from
the
yeasty
sourness
that
plays
out
a
bit
to
much
in
the
middle
areas
for
a
full
quaffing
experience
other
then
that
this
is
a
very
soild
beer
and
a
nice
treat
to
wrap
yourself
up
in
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
smoky
aroma
looks
like
a
frothed
up
porter
in
the
glass
smoky
taste
to
match
the
smell
burnt
raisin
and
charcoal
flavor
touches
on
both
imperial
and
baltic
stout
flavors
but
not
really
the
style
it
professes
to
be
thin
palate
not
something
id
seek
out
again
but
interesting
to
see
the
belgian
take
on
a
foreign
stout
overall
im
very
impressed
good
flavors
interesting
carbonation
nice
high
alcohol
content
bravo
bottle
poured
a
very
dark
brown
thick
head
almost
a
fullblown
brown
color
with
large
bubbles
at
the
bottom
and
it
thinned
towards
the
top
aroma
was
very
sweet
alchhol
present
small
hint
of
roasted
coffee
on
a
deep
inhale
bottle
says
refermented
in
the
bottle
and
mine
was
very
carbonated
i
could
taste
the
dark
malt
it
also
imparted
a
very
rich
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
burnt
sweetness
to
it
i
too
noticed
a
little
sourness
to
it
as
mentioned
in
another
review
so
thanks
for
helping
me
identify
that
charcteristic
i
couldnt
quite
describe
finishes
with
a
nice
clean
coffe
taste
a
very
bubbly
dark
sweet
stout
that
combines
the
roasted
malt
with
roasted
coffee
cheers
joe
a
creamy
smokey
and
robust
export
stout
one
of
the
best
tasting
versions
of
the
style
ive
had
to
date
strongly
recommended
other
flavor
included
burnt
malt
and
some
chocolate
too
based
on
the
price
i
cant
recommend
this
unless
you
love
high
alcohol
stouts
drinkability
stouts
from
belgium
was
a
bit
hesitant
to
try
this
even
after
i
saw
the
good
marks
very
impressive
id
say
this
is
just
as
good
as
the
upper
eschelon
of
stouts
period
yummy
and
chewy
get
some
today
pours
out
a
dark
raisiny
brown
totally
opaque
smell
is
somewhat
yeasty
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
brown
more
than
a
stout
taste
is
of
a
dry
stout
lots
of
hop
flavor
with
very
roasted
malt
feels
very
much
like
a
revvedup
guinness
to
me
some
coffee
overtones
but
mostly
roasted
flavors
not
what
i
expected
good
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
the
sweeter
stouts
that
i
prefer
recommended
for
those
who
prefer
a
dryer
roastier
style
heck
of
a
stout
this
is
found
it
up
in
belfast
pours
pitch
black
cant
see
through
it
thick
head
that
lasts
for
several
minutes
powerful
taste
of
burnt
caramel
raisin
and
alcohol
very
prominent
mouthfeel
is
quite
thick
overall
it
is
pretty
good
can
only
and
have
one
per
night
if
to
be
had
on
a
regular
basis
the
most
powerful
stout
ive
tasted
yet
either
way
a
nice
deviation
from
my
normal
selection
and
one
id
visit
again
by
far
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
because
its
not
like
any
stout
ive
ever
had
i
really
like
the
fruit
undertones
last
swigs
black
coffee
belgian
welcome
flavors
that
cover
a
vast
spread
of
flavors
an
interesting
brew
for
sure
spot
on
for
de
dolle
again
one
of
my
favorite
producers
for
their
spirit
and
talent
would
love
to
be
able
to
substitue
6
ounces
or
so
of
this
after
dinner
instead
of
a
coffee
poured
an
opaque
black
no
hue
or
light
even
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
huge
blooming
head
that
went
over
the
glass
whoo
dont
know
where
that
came
from
rich
aromas
raisin
and
bitter
chocolate
really
show
thru
with
a
tinge
of
that
belgian
yeast
lingeringkind
of
a
prickly
mouthfeel
but
the
body
was
quite
nice
flavors
are
not
overly
sweet
by
any
imagination
bitter
unsweetened
chocolate
and
dark
roast
coffee
dominate
a
touch
of
earth
in
the
finish
rounds
this
beer
out
nicely
not
a
bas
stout
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
making
it
quite
drinkablei
would
buy
again
as
i
said
it
is
the
most
drinkable
stout
i
have
ever
had
and
if
they
werent
5
a
bottle
i
could
definitely
pound
a
few
away
in
a
session
nevertheless
it
didnt
blow
my
mind
i
expected
some
deeper
flavors
very
thin
looking
dark
dark
brown
in
color
one
inch
deep
head
with
a
brown
hint
to
it
nose
is
cocoa
and
licorice
flavor
is
actually
kind
of
disappointing
some
cocao
molasses
and
raisins
the
alcohol
is
also
a
bit
apparent
and
gives
a
rumlike
flavor
kind
of
a
bitter
bite
from
the
hops
that
destroys
any
more
flavors
after
the
initial
sip
very
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
burn
kind
of
a
struggle
to
drink
and
not
too
keen
on
belgians
stouts
drinkability
and
notes
this
is
an
odd
beer
not
my
taste
in
a
stout
or
a
belgian
ale
certainly
an
interesting
experience
but
i
enjoyed
la
maitresse
du
moine
a
similar
beer
which
has
flavors
that
melds
in
a
more
pleasing
way
dark
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
had
a
little
trouble
pouring
this
one
as
a
matter
of
fact
well
ok
a
lot
dark
chocolatey
and
earthy
vinous
aroma
with
coffee
slight
funky
yeast
aroma
with
vanilla
and
wood
characteristics
every
once
in
a
while
i
get
a
whiff
of
something
really
funky
like
a
fried
egg
or
something
weird
also
a
hint
of
plastic
or
soemthing
sometimes
you
catch
a
little
alcohol
too
less
sweet
than
the
smell
lets
on
with
strong
coffee
and
wood
characteristics
bitter
chocolate
mingles
with
the
vinous
flavors
that
mellows
to
a
vanilla
flavor
at
the
back
of
the
mouth
a
little
salty
soy
fades
in
and
out
a
little
black
locorice
comes
at
towards
the
finish
as
well
as
some
spicyness
and
some
well
covered
booze
a
little
bit
of
yeasty
funk
every
few
sips
or
so
berry
flavors
come
out
about
mid
glass
adding
a
nice
complexity
to
an
already
complex
beer
a
hazelnut
taste
shows
up
around
then
too
the
plastic
shows
up
here
in
the
taste
too
in
a
very
small
amount
slick
full
body
with
delicate
carbonation
good
drinkability
lots
of
flavors
none
overpowering
very
well
balanced
belgian
stouts
seem
to
be
quite
an
experience
try
this
it
is
a
very
welcome
change
from
the
typical
impstout
no
freshness
date
but
ii
on
cap
great
presentation
with
well
lasting
creamy
head
and
coffeblack
beer
nose
is
delicate
giving
lots
of
chocolate
in
oaked
strawberryplumb
jam
and
that
in
a
wonderfull
mixture
of
carramellic
malts
taste
is
good
to
but
exceptionally
chocolate
like
though
litle
overroasted
cacao
this
with
a
good
oaked
note
and
a
litle
funkyness
from
fermaging
in
barrels
make
it
well
drinkable
but
hard
too
get
all
flavours
in
the
complex
brew
fine
mouthfeel
with
good
but
for
stout
high
carbonisation
but
migh
oh
migh
what
a
rich
taste
litle
hard
and
bitter
but
well
recomendable
imo
overall
a
very
good
and
very
drinkable
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
mouthfeeldrinkability
slightly
aggressive
at
first
then
smooth
and
enjoyable
i
cant
imagine
following
up
with
another
but
hell
this
was
good
d
stunning
and
delicious
extra
stout
by
de
dolle
rather
different
from
my
expectation
of
an
imperial
stout
in
terms
of
aroma
and
a
flavour
gearing
towards
understated
malty
texture
but
extremely
beautifully
balanced
and
mellow
the
belgians
really
know
their
beers
pretty
well
and
this
is
yet
another
rare
treat
from
de
dolle
to
all
beerlovers
would
buy
some
more
to
store
for
the
future
overall
a
powerful
and
inyourface
stout
pricey
but
worth
a
try
d
i
could
not
imagine
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
with
its
strong
abv
and
that
it
is
a
very
filling
beer
since
this
stout
reminds
me
of
desert
one
is
quite
filling
and
more
importantly
more
satisfying
you
got
to
love
the
root
beer
float
pour
of
a
good
stout
the
alcohol
flavor
was
strong
on
the
pour
with
some
hints
of
nuts
and
chocolate
fighting
through
the
booze
it
is
highly
carbonated
which
was
unexpected
and
it
took
away
from
the
taste
as
it
warmed
its
flavor
profile
came
through
much
better
truly
unique
in
the
stout
world
it
has
a
bitter
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
flavor
and
the
tartness
of
some
white
grape
and
cranberry
notes
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
one
and
while
it
was
good
it
was
not
great
the
flavor
is
chocolatey
nutty
fruity
figplum
peppery
a
touch
candyish
bubblegum
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
and
drying
wash
of
alcohol
as
it
warms
the
carbonation
softens
to
become
silky
smooth
the
peppery
spice
fades
and
the
flavor
widens
id
suggest
pulling
this
from
the
fridge
and
letting
it
sit
for
a
few
mintues
before
pouring
from
there
itll
warm
naturally
as
you
enjoy
it
its
a
sipper
not
a
quaffer
it
finishes
lingering
with
a
touch
of
creamy
cocoahazelnutmocha
java
isnt
that
an
option
for
a
starbucks
gande
some
solid
nuttiness
and
an
appropriate
walnutskinlike
bitterness
a
bit
of
metallic
character
appears
later
and
it
has
a
phenolic
burp
as
well
but
neither
detracts
from
its
character
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
between
this
and
the
hercule
stout
also
from
belgium
i
am
content
for
the
moment
with
not
having
access
to
some
of
the
bigger
american
stouts
those
wacky
belgians
have
done
it
again
id
say
this
is
a
combination
of
a
belgian
special
or
extra
beer
with
an
export
stout
pours
out
looking
like
coca
cola
lively
carbonation
that
is
just
right
smell
is
slightly
malty
taste
notes
of
bakers
chocolate
subtle
dark
fruits
light
red
wine
characteristics
perhaps
rich
full
mouthfeel
nice
tingling
on
the
tounge
a
very
very
drinkable
beer
even
at
9
abv
well
worth
seeking
out
tastes
of
cola
bittersweet
chocolate
melted
with
a
little
water
burnt
bread
pudding
extra
strong
black
licorice
raspberry
jam
spread
thin
on
a
toasted
cedar
plank
theres
definite
alcohol
ohs
in
here
its
just
shy
of
burning
has
a
cola
feel
to
it
its
not
quite
smooth
or
creamy
really
a
great
extra
stout
excellent
drindabillity
and
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
as
the
beer
warmed
a
tad
the
flavors
become
more
subtle
beer
had
a
smooth
full
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
have
it
again
ill
stick
with
the
other
beers
ok
stuff
an
interesting
brew
at
least
another
fabulous
beer
from
de
dolle
i
have
not
tasted
anything
of
theirs
that
has
ever
been
less
than
wonderful
upon
first
sipping
this
beer
it
literally
froth
on
my
tongue
from
the
ample
carbonation
so
i
swirl
a
bit
of
it
out
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
with
notes
of
burnt
raisin
it
finishes
a
bit
hot
from
fermentation
by
products
which
actually
form
an
astringent
almost
bitter
component
that
helps
to
balance
the
sweetness
found
at
the
beginning
this
beer
is
really
light
on
the
palate
almost
refreshing
in
character
i
must
say
i
am
quite
enjoying
this
beer
there
is
a
nice
roast
coffee
note
in
the
finish
that
only
appears
after
the
beer
has
been
swallowed
there
is
a
combination
of
carbonation
and
yeast
derived
notes
that
give
this
beer
a
spicy
prickly
and
perhaps
a
hint
of
a
vegetal
note
all
in
all
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
really
is
quite
intriguing
and
makes
for
a
contemplative
complex
tasting
beer
bottle
poured
a
medium
black
color
ale
with
a
super
huge
bubbly
head
with
excellent
retention
maybe
even
so
much
retention
that
i
regretted
using
a
tulip
glass
to
poured
this
beer
aroma
of
subtle
coffee
and
chocolate
with
great
malt
and
belgian
yeast
which
give
this
stout
its
own
personal
aspect
another
great
beer
from
de
dolle
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
huge
creamcolored
head
the
head
was
actually
too
big
even
though
i
poured
this
one
very
slowly
aroma
is
a
mix
of
cocoa
beans
musty
yeast
and
notes
of
alcohol
flavor
is
quite
complex
beginning
with
chocolate
covered
cherries
then
moving
to
roasted
malt
but
very
minimal
coffee
flavor
the
finish
is
dominated
by
alcohol
but
its
not
overpowering
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
and
a
full
body
this
is
a
beer
that
is
very
interesting
and
quite
tasty
enjoyed
as
a
4oz
sample
at
the
belgian
beer
fest
2004
oddly
enough
stouts
here
pours
a
very
darkstout
standard
black
head
is
moderate
and
offwhite
ruby
when
held
up
to
the
light
smell
is
more
alcoholic
than
most
beers
and
so
is
the
taste
a
very
weird
feel
on
the
tongue
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
unfortunately
high
alcohol
doesnt
go
particularly
well
with
stouts
heavy
and
sharp
this
beer
is
for
some
only
now
the
beer
an
enormous
initial
head
many
moments
later
aroma
of
coffee
grinds
but
this
worked
the
malts
the
yeast
hand
it
to
the
belgiums
note
for
those
who
serve
this
let
it
sit
the
carbonation
tamed
makes
this
much
better
pour
it
a
goot
10
minutes
before
you
intend
to
serve
it
thanks
for
the
hard
to
find
de
dolle
brew
cokes
mad
indeed
a
dark
black
brew
that
is
nearly
opaque
a
nice
top
hat
of
brown
foam
lingers
and
leaves
sheets
of
lace
the
aromas
really
run
the
spectrum
between
bsda
and
imperial
stout
dark
fruits
alcohol
plums
raisins
sugar
yeasty
esters
bread
various
exotic
spices
and
more
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
and
this
is
really
complex
stuff
there
is
a
distinct
roastiness
in
the
flavor
of
this
brew
but
there
is
definately
a
lack
of
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
that
dominate
in
other
us
versions
this
one
is
decidedly
belgian
a
bit
heavy
in
the
mouth
but
quite
drinkable
for
such
an
odd
creation
perfection
no
impressive
yes
rededged
pitch
under
a
pudgy
pocked
cap
of
stiff
foam
spring
brings
chocolate
blossoms
over
packed
soil
and
wet
dead
leaves
and
raisins
still
on
the
vine
surviving
hungry
game
and
the
cold
edge
of
winter
charged
charcoal
brandy
ignites
the
buds
before
slowly
turning
a
bitter
juniper
crust
this
stuff
is
hot
on
multiple
levels
a
foamy
and
rocky
entry
into
the
glass
produces
a
gorgeous
brown
head
that
stays
awhile
hazy
yeasty
dark
ruby
liquid
sweet
and
roasty
nose
with
hints
of
funky
belgian
farmyard
yeastiness
nice
dark
chocolate
and
fruity
flavors
blend
with
light
phenol
tones
some
alcohol
heat
felt
on
the
palate
finishes
up
dry
and
chocolatey
very
drinkable
thanks
to
kmpitz2
for
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
an
extremely
tall
head
that
has
good
retention
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolate
but
its
not
very
strong
the
flavor
is
much
more
interesting
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
goodness
on
top
of
a
dark
malt
backbone
good
body
and
easy
to
drink
holy
foam
batman
the
head
is
amazing
on
this
beer
four
fingers
falls
to
a
nice
coating
over
thebeer
after
15
minutes
the
nose
is
not
quite
what
i
expect
from
a
stout
thre
is
a
sweet
cherry
quality
to
it
not
so
sure
the
flavor
is
more
chocolate
and
coffee
than
the
nose
would
tell
the
cherry
is
there
on
the
finish
but
subdued
i
enjoy
the
flavor
of
this
one
more
than
the
nose
the
feel
is
nice
and
thick
no
creamyness
or
silkyness
but
just
a
nice
thick
feel
overall
i
am
impressed
with
this
as
a
belgian
stout
its
worth
a
look
in
my
book
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
this
brewery
a
beautiful
hybrid
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
body
to
it
with
a
slight
creaminess
but
the
overcarbonation
really
throws
me
off
if
this
was
a
bit
smoother
itd
be
much
better
in
my
book
i
cant
see
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
an
interesting
stout
that
is
well
worth
a
try
that
was
the
end
of
the
review
most
of
the
bottle
went
down
the
drain
slowly
positive
scores
for
appearance
smell
and
mouthfeel
shouldnt
factor
in
but
thats
how
this
system
works
drinkability
is
good
obviously
very
wellmade
beer
a
uniquely
belgian
twist
on
the
stout
style
very
interesting
pours

held
to
a
light
and
then
reveals
a
deep
chestnut
color
extremely
vigorous
when
poureda
huge
head
rises
out
of
the
glass
i
had
to
reserve
half
the
bottle
until
it
receeded
almost
whiskey
like

belgian

notes
pronounced

flavor
i
miss
the
big
malt
flavor
of
a
stout
but
then
again
this
is
a
belgian
alcohol
tends
to
come
thru
a
touch
good
body
an
enjoyable
beerthe
sharp
whiskey
and
alcohol
flavors
tend
to

it

many
thanks
to
todd
deep
dark
brown
in

almost
black
it
forms
a
thick
creamy
light
brown
head
pretty
good
amount
of
lacing
is
left
behind
on
each
sip
the
aroma
is
yeast
and
herbal
like
a
belgian
with
a
candi
sugar
sweetness
it
has
a
nice
roasted
maltiness
as
well
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
malty
slightly
roasty
and
chocolatey
it
is
sweet
and
alcoholic
as
well
with
an

yeasty

ive
got
to
get
the
local
bottle
shop
to
carry
this
or
do
i
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
difficult
expensive
addiction
yum
the
strength
is
showing
and
doing
what
it
does
time
to
call
it
a
night
but
what
a
lovely
way
to
close
it
this
is
something
else
a
belgian
imperial
stout
or
so
it
feels
ive
got
to
stock
up
on
these
now
that
ive
tasted
its
glorious
goodness
and
have
become
an
instant
affirmed
fan
as
beer
warms
it
gains
more
and
more
tingling
flavors
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
throughout
and
head
retention
is
very
good
as
the
beer
reaches
the
bottom
the
rounded
characteristics
of
the
water
roll
on
the
tounge
nicely
tastes
very
much
like
a
licourice
stout
real
quick
on
the
tip
of
the
tounge
then
rolls
down
the
tounge
with
a
sweet
alcoholic
warmth
compared
to
other
beers
from
belgium
i
have
tasted
it
compares
very
good
in
the
bottle
catagory
and
is
like
no
other
style
i
have
tasted
you
definetly
have
to
let
this
sit
a
bit
and
release
some
of
the
carbonation
it
becomes
a
bit
easier
to
drink
still
very
carbonted
though
maybe
worth
picking
up
a
great
job
of
taking
a
classic
style
and
giving
it
a
belgian
twist
taking
a
style
and
marrying
to
another
is
not
often
pulled
off
well
done
de
dolle
drinkability
interesting
and
quite
satisfying
one
of
the
pioneers
of
the
belgian
stout
style
i
misunderstood
this
beer
when
i
first
tasted
it
a
few
years
back
but
now
i
think
of
it
as
satisfyingly
complex
huge
amount
of
greyish
brown
sludge
in
the
top
of
the
bottle
neck
tons
of
head
foamed
up
all
over
the
place
even
though
i
had
left
the
glass
half
filled
it
still
started
to
foam
over
dark
rootbeered
brown
that
you
cannot
see
through
vineous
scent
and
taste
more
towards
a
red
wine
light
in
the
aroma
very
highly
carbinated
too
much
for
my
tastes
this
does
not
taste
much
like
a
stout
more
towards
a
barleywine
strange
it
just
seemed
like
one
i
would
like
but
it
just
did
not
work
for
me
drinkability
this
beer
is
just
not
for
me
not
to
my
likings
at
all
and
i
will
not
be
drinking
it
again
so
there
you
have
it
get
this
beer
some
haldol
on
second
thought
dont
ive
been
critical
of
beers
with
seemingly
scattered
ideas
of
what
they
were
but
every
so
often
theres
something
special
that
comes
your
way
and
while
it
may
not
be
john
nash

a
beer

pretty
damn

a

a

on

this
is
a
big
brew
and
quite
tasty
just
a
few
of
these
would
set
you
up
for
the
nite
i
think
this
is
a
classic
already
but
sit
on
this
for
a
year
or
so
and
it
may
well
be
untouchable
points
for
experimenting
but
ill
never
get
it
again
fun
to
try
at
least
very
interesting
beer
thanks
to
fellow
ba
denali
for
pointing
it
out
to
us
had
in
the
bottle
at
anam
cara
pour
was
opaque
dark
chocolate
that
came
topped
with
a
light
white
creme
head
aroma
was
very
interesting
malt
meets
yeast
there
was
also
some
mustiness
and
cocoa
powder
in
there
too
tastewise
it
comes
across
as
a
belgian
stout
duh
theres
some
initial
yeastiness
followed
by
a
roasted
finish
good
mouthfeel
enough
carbonation
if
you
like
belgian
styles
or
are
a
stout
lover
you
owe
it
yourself
to
try
this
unique
beer
overall
i
found
it
just
a
roasted
bite
away
from
a
belgian
strong
dark
which
was
not
too
much
of
a
surprise
this
beer
deserves
a
far
more
interesting
name
and
frankly
i
am
disappointed
in
the
mad
brewers
using
such
a
generic
notmadatall
name
but
it
is
the
beer
that
really
matters
and
this
one
is
awesome
this
is
a
one
at
a
time
dessert
beer
anymore
than
one
at
a
time
wouldnt
do
it
justice
great
head
first
off
the
nose
in
this
beer
is
averagebut
that
is
the
only
thing
average
about
this
beer
nice
and
dark
can
barely
see
through
a
little
bit
of
roast
on
the
nosebut
slight
but
you
can
definaley
smell
the
malts
rich
and
explosive
in
your
mouth
sweet
but
balanced
this
beer
could
be
drunk
in
mass
quantitys
but
at
four
bucks
a
pop
sort
of
hard
hats
off
for
the
first
rich
belgian
stout
ive
ever
had
11
2
ounce
bottle
33
cl
a
very
complex
and
interesting
stout
which
offers
tons
of
complexity
and
flavor
the
mad
brewers
have
truly
gone
mad
with
this
one
i
dont
know
what
they
actually
put
into
the
bottle
but
i
have
three
more
in
which
to
find
out
appearance
is
pitchblack
body
with
a
giant
tan
head
that
keep
coming
close
to
overflowing
it
took
me
quite
a
while
to
get
the
whole
beer
in
the
glass
with
the
way
the
head
was
acting
rings
of
lace
were
left
around
the
glass
as
i
consume
this
aroma
was
of
sweet
malt
with
a
dash
of
alcohol
over
a
roasted
scent
the
flavor
was
filled
with
chocolate
malt
with
fruitiness
to
it
of
darker
fruits
alcohol
was
present
as
was
a
distinct
licorice
flavor
the
taste
ended
of
a
roasty
alcohol
note
that
seemed
to
linger
for
a
bit
body
was
about
medium
and
creamy
with
good
drinkability
good
brew
that
i
would
definitely
pick
up
again
this
pours
like
a
de
dolle
brew
it
has
a
beautiful
small
bubbled
rocky
head
on
top
of
an
opaque
dark
brown
body
that
barely
fits
into
a
12
oz
chalice
actually
it
doesnt
the
aroma
is
basil
and
liquorice
with
a
sweet
taste
following
more
inscrutable
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
without
the
smooth
anesthesia
of
a
soft
water
beer
its
slippery
and
interupted
by
persistent
carbonation
ill
drink
this
again
i
will
buy
enough
to
cover
a
session
and
unwaveringly
refill
my
glass
until
its
end
of
night
time
de
dolle
extra
import
stout
was
served
from
a
white
and
black
labeled
330
ml
bottle
in
a
duvel
tulip
the
beer
was
black
though
with
backlighting
the
black
became
tinged
with
a
ruddybrown
hue
it
was
topped
by
a
vouminous
creamy
and
fine
tan
head
which
settled
to
an
everlasting
1cm
topping
leaving
thick
blankets
of
lacing
the
nose
was
powerful
and
complex
presenting
coffee
notes
highly
developed
spiced
aromas
of
dried
fruits
raisins
pears
cherries
apricots
raisins
prunes
and
wafts
of
sasparilla
a
fermented
fruit
alcohol
was
somewhat
noticable
as
the
beer
neared
room
temp
but
was
very
well
melded
with
the
fruits
and
roastiness
the
taste
was
simply
exceptional
opening
with
a
roasted
coffeemolasses
flavor
that
quickly
exploded
with
a
fantastic
grabbag
of
spicyroasty
and
vibrant
dried
fruit
flavors
muscatlate
harvest
grape
raisins
figs
cherries
apricots
plum
licorice
notes
and
a
relapse
of
creamy
coffee
flavors
appeared
in
the
transition
joining
the
dried
fruits
to
the
sharpcolachocolate
bittered
finish
that
left
eternally
lingering
notes
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
cherry
wow
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
was
detectable
but
it
again
it
was
so
well
melded
with
the
flavors
it
was
not
detrimental
at
all
the
brew
was
slightly
warming
in
the
tummy
the
body
was
creamyfull
and
the
carbonation
was
a
tad
fluffy
working
very
well
with
the
flavors
and
character
of
the
beer
de
dolle
export
stout
is
a
delicous
piece
of
work
and
will
be
loved
by
fans
of
strong
dark
belgian
style
brews
excellent
a
failure
absolutely
not
but
this
needs
work
especially
if
it
is
intended
for
the
u
s
market
at
the
end
it
is
too
normal
to
be
a
beer
from
the
de
dolle
brewery
maybe
we
can
expect
a
little
more
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
a
decent
beer
overall
but
there
are
certainly
better
alternatives
within
the
style
got
a
few
of
these
in
a
couple
of
trades
poured
an
awesome
midnight
black
with
fantastic
thick
head
and
great
lacing
very
nice
thick
and
deep
scent
with
sweet
malts
roasted
grains
and
a
nice
bit
of
earthy
hops
in
the
back
great
flavor
with
great
roasted
grains
a
nice
hint
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
a
nice
earthy
hoppiness
at
the
end
to
mellow
it
out
it
went
down
great
with
little
hint
of
its
higher
abv
looking
forward
to
having
another
at
halloween
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
tastes
toasted
grains
and
bready
flavors
are
among
the
first
things
that
hit
my
palate
before
the
bitterness
associated
with
dark
roasted
malts
this
brew
is
very
well
balanced
between
the
chocolatecoffee
the
sweetness
and
the
slight
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
flavors
the
beer
has
a
texture
on
the
thick
side
of
mediumbodied
with
a
smooth
and
with
a
smooth
and
viscous
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
wow
now
this
is
a
great
stout
definitely
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
the
beer
is
black
deep
black
thick
almost
chewy
thick
pours
like
molasses
but
all
of
these
adjectives
i
use
lovingly
this
beer
is
smooth
and
heavy
it
definitely
has
some
weight
behind
it
and
is
definitely
a
new
favorite
of
mine
the
only
negative
thing
i
can
and
will
say
about
this
brew
is
that
i
should
have
tried
it
sooner
if
you
love
stouts
like
me
do
not
pass
this
up
this
is
top
notch
stuff
honestly
i
think
this
is
and
many
other
imperial
stouts
are
over
the
top
rejecting
flavor
in
place
of
abv
and
cred
bring
the
abvs
down
a
touch
and
i
bet
i
would
be
able
to
pick
out
a
lot
more
of
the
tasty
nuances
of
this
brew
but
that
may
just
be
my
antihigh
grav
self
talking
i
could
drink
another
one
if
i
had
a
another
one
really
tasty
easy
to
drink
and
no
booze
taste
there
is
not
much
of
an
aroma
coming
from
this
beer
some
pretty
minor
chocolaty
undertones
and
some
hints
of
coffee
but
nothing
that
really
catches
your
attention
it
has
a
very
nice
subtle
chocolaty
flavor
not
bitter
but
not
overly
sweet
the
chocolate
and
roasty
flavors
are
the
most
prevalent
pretty
much
no
hops
at
all
theres
not
too
much
else
going
on
flavor
wise
and
it
has
a
little
more
carbonation
that
i
prefer
in
a
stout
but
its
not
enough
to
ruin
the
smoothness
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
definitely
a
worthy
stout
hv
d
very
nice
beer
easy
drinker
for
sure
i
would
pick
this
up
again
if
given
the
chance
d
this
one
doesnt
really
need
to
be
split
but
sharing
it
with
a
friend
is
always
nice
and
to
answer
the
labels
question
do
you
dare
yes
i
do
its
a
great
stout
this
is
my
first
reaperale
beer
its
alright
but
im
far
from
blown
away
its
above
average
but
it
needs
a
little
more
of
everything
to
really
stand
out
more
aromatics
a
stronger
flavor
and
more
body
its
not
a
total
disaster
and
is
probably
worth
a
try
go
for
the
single
bomber
though
drinks
well
enough
and
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
more
than
decent
brew
and
the
first
goes
down
pleasantly
and
tasty
but
i
think
1
is
good
ill
probably
drink
one
of
these
once
or
twice
every
month
or
so
cheers
taste
is
pretty
thin
even
approaching
watery
with
coffee
and
colaesque
malt
flavors
leading
the
way
some
slight
astringency
and
the
abv
is
not
very
well
disguised
light
fruits
like
some
cantaloupe
and
strawberries
are
in
there
and
is
not
very
tasty
in
this
style
of
stout
an
acrid
bitterness
lingers
long
on
the
palate
and
pretty
sure
it
is
not
from
hops
this
beer
is
not
one
of
the
better
foreign
export
stouts
i
have
had
i
wont
have
too
much
trouble
finishing
the
bomber
but
this
is
not
one
i
will
be
purchasing
again
d
these
flavors
are
too
whacky
for
me
to
find
this
to
be
a
long
session
beer
abv
is
high
but
manageable
not
filling
overall
a
good
example
of
a
foreignexport
stout
my
main
complaint
is
that
the
aroma
just
doesnt
show
much
in
terms
of
the
roasted
grains
other
than
a
light
dusting
of
roast
i
get
mostly
licorice
and
a
little
fruit
also
the
carbonation
bites
a
little
but
this
is
actually
considered
appropriate
for
style
worth
trying
but
maybe
a
cut
below
top
of
the
line
drinkability
very
nice
smell
and
the
flavors
are
quite
nice
i
do
wish
the
body
was
a
bit
thicker
the
abv
is
pretty
doable
for
a
stout
7
75
so
i
could
get
through
a
couple
glasses
in
a
night
but
probably
not
much
more
than
that
overall
this
is
a
decent
sipper
it
lacks
the
punch
of
a
great
stout
even
so
it
still
quenched
my
thirst
on
this
dreary
winter
day
i
guess
this
beer
is
pretty
good
i
kind
of
flipflopped
during
the
consumption
but
overall
i
was
pleased
roasty
slightly
fruity
salty
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
and
quite
dry
enjoyable
overall
this
was
a
pretty
fair
beer
get
ready
for
some
intensity
of
the
roasted
character
overally
id
like
it
i
think
i
would
have
given
it
a
better
score
if
it
wasnt
for
that
soury
aroma
in
the
nose
character
it
thows
it
off
and
makes
you
think
of
soured
milk
before
you
drink
it
however
once
you
can
get
past
it
the
flavor
is
very
nice
the
drink
leans
more
toward
medium
in
a
mediumfullish
body
with
an
additional
lighteningup
of
fine
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
pours
black
as
the
dead
of
night
with
little
lacing
and
a
very
dark
head
smells
faintly
like
coffee
and
coffee
notes
begin
in
the
taste
but
there
is
also
a
dry
dark
fruit
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
its
abv
if
you
are
looking
to
try
something
out
of
the
ordinary
this
is
it
hope
i
had
a
bad
bottle
nice
roasted
flavor
not
bad
okay
i
think
this
beer
is
one
of
the
more
true
locals
i
do
graphic
design
for
a
living
and
believe
the
label
for
the
beer
was
made
by
the
guys
that
created
the
beer
or
perhaps
they
have
a
friend
who
made
it
really
papyrus
for
the
mortality
stout
font
i
personally
think
papyrus
should
be
outlawed
along
with
the
fajita
font
it
seems
every
grandma
or
antique
shopper
uses
these
damned
fonts
sorry
for
going
on
a
rant
i
happen
to
be
a
design
snob
but
i
also
am
a
beer
snob
sort
of
and
while
reaper
ale
has
a
generic
trying
too
hard
design
they
do
have
a
high
quality
beer
pours
dark
black
with
a
tan
head
smell
is
lots
of
roasty
malt
with
a
little
dark
fruit
flavor
is
more
roasted
malt
with
a
strong
roasted
aftertaste
there
is
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
in
the
taste
as
well
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
recommended
the
only
nonhopdriven
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
and
a
pretty
good
stout
not
bad
i
just
wish
it
had
more
bold
roasted
flavor
that
i
love
so
much
with
stouts
still
worth
a
try
an
okay
stout
this
seems
like
an
example
of
marketing
over
substance
cmon
who
uses
the
papyrus
font
still
seriously
tisk
tisk
and
shame
on
them
not
worth
the
trouble
d
i
couldnt
finish
my
12ozs
poured
in
my
glass
i
have
a
certain
distaste
for
dry
stouts
but
i
expect
a
little
more
robust
flavors
from
an
export
stout
decent
stout
i
am
not
a
fan
of
stouts
but
tried
this
in
a
beer
of
the
month
selection
and
it
is
good
out
of
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
and
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
a
deep
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
fluffy
tan
foam
nose
and
flavor
are
of
roasted
grains
bittersweet
cocoa
caramel
bitter
and
pungent
bad
coffee
dark
toast
medium
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
pours
opaque
with
offwhite
head
aroma
is
sweet
cream
and
some
notes
of
chocolate
taste
is
very
subtle
slight
chocolate
with
a
dry
finish
and
rather
boring
in
flavor
light
carbonation
in
this
mediumbodied
brew
this
is
not
quite
what
i
look
for
in
a
stout
it
was
drinkable
but
not
very
enjoyable
d
pass
a
little
too
far
down
the
funk
road
for
me
and
out
of
style
as
well
pours
very
dark
with
almost
no
head
nor
lace
its
very
subdued
in
smell
earthy
with
some
cocoa
undertones
the
taste
is
very
lacking
for
this
level
of
beer
imo
not
near
enough
sweetness
lots
of
sour
thin
even
the
mouth
is
thin
not
very
drinkable
at
all
dark
brown
head
about
one
finger
thick
that
slowly
recedes
to
nothing
black
hued
beer
with
just
a
thin
ring
of
brown
highlight
heavy
roasted
malts
give
mixed
aromas
of
coffee
and
chocolate
this
mixes
with
a
tart
cherry
aroma
starts
out
with
some
roasted
tartad
vinuous
fruits
through
the
middle
to
the
finish
the
roasted
malt
comes
through
with
an
eventual
tart
chocolate
finish
the
only
bitterness
in
this
beer
is
in
atouch
of
alcohol
in
the
palate
thats
about
it
was
not
expecting
a
somewhat
puckering
stout
d
i
bet
this
beer
would
be
great
on
tap
a
lot
of
really
good
features
in
this
beer
but
everything
is
dominated
by
the
twang
infected
bottle
flaw
in
the
bottling
procedure
needed
more
conditioning
time
i
dont
know
but
this
was
a
drain
pour
d
not
very
good
unfortunately
some
strange
off
flavours
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
beverage
but
nothing
spectacular
there
seems
to
be
an
intense
and
somewhat
inappropriate
sourness
that
i
associate
with
red
wine
that
is
too
old
like
a
vinegar
it
is
not
that
offensive
just
way
too
pronounced
i
think
it
would
be
pleasant
if
it
were
more
subtle
as
i
enjoy
sour
beers
very
much
notes
i
always
handwrite
my
reviews
then
enter
them
into
the
computer
when
i
have
the
time
i
didnt
plan
on
posting
this
as
i
figured
that
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
but
after
reading
some
other
reviews
that
said
the
same
thing
i
decided
to
go
ahead
with
it
just
plain
awful

lightfeeling
in

and
had
a
smooth
dry
finish
almost
like
a
dryirish
stout
definitely
will
have
another
outstanding
label
this
stout
stands
on
its
own
it
isnt
an
outstanding
stout
but
it
stands
out
there
it
has
a
caramel
and
malt
vinegar
aroma
just
a
tad
to
much
roast
in
the
body
this
may
sound
bad
but
it
isnt
it
is
a
drinkable
midrange
stout
this
beer
is
probably
spoiled
but
i
dont
know
what
they
were
shooting
for
so
maybe
not
definitely
undrinkable
drain
pour
drinkability
this
is
one
funky
sour
with
way
too
many
malted
roasted
astringencies
this
one
was
rough
really
rough
and
i
cant
recommend
it
to
anyone
overall
not
impressed
the
overly
sweet
malt
dominates
i
say
avoid
this
1
overall
this
was
a
very
solid
easy
to
drink
stout
it
wasnt
spectacular
by
no
means
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
better
than
the
nose
suggested
some
nice
roastiness
with
a
hint
of
smoke
that
same
powdery
cocoa
and
even
leaving
a
chalky
mouthfeel
finish
is
stale
and
unappeasing
caramel
shows
through
more
with
a
big
dose
of
barley

pretty
lackluster
beer
d
thanks
to
gueuzedude
for
the
extra
from
his
lif
my
first
of
this
style
was
pretty
good
but
with
all
the
other
stout
options
out
there
not
bad
very
close
to
great
d
this
is
a
really
good
stout
creamy
and
smooth
i
could
easily
have
another
one
pours
a
beautiful
root
beer
brownish
red
with
a
thick
dark
head
very
happy
with
this
beer
not
as
rich
as
i
remember
but
very
delicious
mild
chocolaty
taste
with
a
wonderful
smokey
odor
nice
clean
finish
for
a
stout
im
generally
not
a
stout
gut
but
this
milder
version
works
for
me
hurry

thick
oily
black

into
the

as
it
fades
nose
is
rich
thick
and
chalked
full
of
browny
like
chocolatey
sweetness
which
is
a
lovely
experience
all
its
own
as
it
enters
the
mouth
you
get
a
beer
that
is
smooth
and
balanced
with
tones
of
bitter
chocolate
rich
burnt
malt
and
well
represented
mineral
based
a
nice
even
sweetness
is
there
throughout
the
palate
helping
to
complete
this
very
tasty
brew
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
full
with
a
toasty
darkness
coating
the
tongue
alchol
is
completely
well
hidden
a
very
good
and
exceptionally
drinkable
brew
d
a
nice
hearty
drink
fulfilling
after
one
bomber
that
should
leave
you
satisfied
taste
is
quite
thin
and
a
bit
too
carbonated
in
the
finish
this
one
smells
a
bit
better
than
it
tastes
an
average
stout
pretty
drinkable
for
a
stout
also
particularly
considering
the
high
abv
jen
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
out
of
this
stout
but
i
dont
hate
it
either
it
starts
off
with
a
light
aroma
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
is
of
mocha
roasted
malts
and
a
slight
burntness
to
it
the
chalkiness
imo
is
almost
overwhelming
anything
great
this
beer
could
have
been
so
instead
it
is
just
good
for
7
5
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
leaves
a
sourness
in
your
mouth
afterwards
i
wish
with
a
name
like
this
it
would
have
been
better
drinkability
pretty
easy
to
down
but
not
interesting
enough
to
invest
in
regularly
overall
a
nice
stout
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
it
needs
a
little
more
roast
or
bitterness
imo
an
easy
drinker
for
the
style
thats
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
not
a
problem
here
in
sd
a
nice
strong
stout
not
an
everyday
type
of
beer
but
nevertheless
an
enjoyable
one
very
strong
but
not
overthetop
great
for
lovers
of
this
type
of
beer
ill
be
sure
to
get
this
again
at
some
point
i
picked
this
up
last
summer
and
only
got
around
to
drinking
it
super
bowl
sunday
i
dont
know
if
the
wait
had
any
effect
on
it
but
first
pour
was
very
heady
a
threefinger
pour
yeilded
a
thick
cocoacolored
head
to
the
top
of
the
glass
it
settled
pretty
quickly
and
yielded
an
amazing
smell
or
roasted
chocolate
the
brew
itself
was
midnightblack
but
not
thick
first
sip
brought
a
coffee
taste
and
a
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
it
was
definitely
not
boozy
and
is
smooth
on
the
tongue
very
easy
to
drink
however
the
roastiness
forces
you
to
slow
down
an
enjoy
easily
shot
up
to
one
of
my
most
favorite
stouts
pours
an
almost
opaque
black
with
faint
reddish
highlights
creamy
tan
head
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
is
chocolate
taste
is
roasted
malts
body
is
thinner
than
i
would
have
expected
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
body
and
complexity
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
it
is
enjoyable
flavor
is
close
to
nose
with
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
but
again
the
flavor
is
fairly
mild
the
abv
is
extremely
well
hidden
especially
considering
how
mild
the
flavor
is
easy
drinker
good
beer
not
as
much
flavor
as
i
had
hoped
for
but
good
beer
nonetheless
not
much
head
which
was
a
shame
smell
was
coffee
and
taste
had
that
thick
coffee
chocolate
hit
it
was
a
decent
stout
but
something
was
not
quite
excellent
about
it
it
seemed
harsh
maybe
because
of
the
high
alc
i
will
not
purchase
again
taste
overall
is
good
malty
nutty
and
lightly
chocolately
this
beer
confuses
me
for
several
reasons
this
brewerys
dipa
was
just
awful
and
this
beer
misses
the
mark
for
the
style
completely
yet
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
if
they
labeled
this
beer
as
a
stout
drinkability
nice
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
a
terrific
dry
stout
but
the
abv
is
too
high
for
the
style
as
a
double
it
is
lacking
its
easy
to
drink
fairly
uncomplicated
for
style
when
i
drank
this
i
assumed
it
was
a
stout
this
is
not
an
imperial
as
a
stout
its
not
bad
at
all
but
as
a
double
stout
it
falls
short
i
was
shocked
to
see
it
categorized
as
such
drinks
pretty
easy
but
not
a
super
stout
but
pretty
close
i
guess
im
destined
to
like
every
other
beer
i
get
from
this
brewery
this
one
i
like
drinkability
good
thanks
to
intriqken
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
hmmm
this
is
a
yummy
after
dinner
desert
and
i
am
going
to
enjoy
the
entire
22
oz
very
very
slowly
notes
mouthfeel
isnt
very
full
and
neither
is
the
body
i
would
say
a
shade
under
medium
considering
that
this
is
a
double
stout
you
could
drink
lots
of
it
very
drinkable
but
i
wish
it
had
more
bitterness
the
chocolate
flavor
is
good
but
theres
just
something
missing
from
this
beer
to
be
very
good
mortality
stout
bit
conflicted
on
how
to
rate
this
its
not
bad
at
all
but
i
felt
the
saltiness
and
sheer
earthy
character
detracted
from
it
a
bit
no
where
near
as
easy
to
drink
as
say
rogues
shakespeare
but
if
you
like
heavy
stouts
that
arent
quite
imperial
give
this
a
try
drinkability

a
lot
of
adss
are
just
too
big
to
enjoy
more
than
one
but
id
like
to
session
this
ontap
for
a
few
hours
d
drinkable
a
very
nice
stout
from
reaper
highly
recommend
tastes
kinda
like
a
minidark
lord
decent
but
not
killer
poured
a
deep
black
color
with
a
slightly
soft
and
bubblelaiden
mocha
colored
head
seemed
somewhat
viscous
during
the
pour
and
left
behind
some
nice
lacing
aromas
of
chocolate
alcohol
and
sugar
the
taste
was
sweet
with
a
bitter
bite
but
not
nearly
as
smooth
or
together
as
other
beers
within
this
style
the
various
flavors
like
chocolate
and
expresso
didnt
really
seem
to
work
in
synergy
overall
this
beer
seems
to
be
going
in
several
different
directions
without
a
clear
cut
profile
or
aim
not
creamy
or
smooth
in
my
mouth
but
definitely
bitter
leading
to
sour
i
had
a
bomber
of
this
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
any
time
soon
the
body
was
good
with
a
mid
to
full
body
feel
not
much
on
the
phenol
flavors
but
lighter
plum
taste
come
out
the
beer
is
a
bit
too
smooth
but
still
enjoyable
to
drink
maybe
instead
of
never
more
it
should
be
well
maybe
one
more

stout
is
yet
another
good
beer
from
a

that
i

is

the

it

a
good
big
stout
though
i
wish
there
was
some
kind
of
slight
hop
flavor
there
and
im
not
one
who
generally
likes
superhopped
stouts
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
again
while
in
greece
the
foreign
extra
stout
has
become
my
favorite
guinness
in
the
us
so
i
wanted
to
have
another
taste
of
this
guy
to
see
who
would
win
out
i
would
say
no
doubt
that
this
is
my
favorite
guinness
stout
and
rates
high
overall
on
the
stouts
i
like
even
though
not
classified
an
imperial
stout
the
alcohol
content
is
high
it
lacks
the
bitterness
of
a
regular
guinness
it
is
almost
sweet
pours
a
dark

i
dont

i
liked

overal
a

and
the
only

sold
at

in

so
thats
a
plus
o
good

beer
with
a
normal

overall
this
is
simply
a
very
good
stout
it
is
as
a

should

it
sets
the

for

about

totally
nothing

here

a

and
a

in
the
end
a
bitter
and
medium

bigger
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
chocolate
roast
in
the
aftertaste
it
is
like
an
imperial
stout
or
guinness
on
steroids
o
delicate
and
rich
extremely
drinkable
but
still
nicely
complex
perfectly
balanced
even
quite
refreshing
which
is
great
to
be
found
in
a
strong
stout
overall
this
was
a
decent
stout
it
was
very
flavorful
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
thanks
doug
for
this
one
a
very
good
drop
which
i
would
love
to
drink
again
o
much
better
than
guinness
draught
roasty
and
chocolatey
and
much
more
bold
still
has
the
classic
guinness
taste
but
much
more
satisfying
dr
i
had
this
the
same
day
i
went
to
the
westvleteren
brewery
and
let
me
tell
you
its
still
fecking
brilliant
by
comparison
lads
the
best
guinness
ive
ever
had
and
i
live
in
ireland
why
we
dont
have
this
back
home
is
beyond
me
if
you
told
me
i
could
have
one
beer
only
for
the
rest
o
me
life
i
assure
you
this
would
be
it
not
as
well
balanced
as
i
expected
and
not
a
beer
id
search
for
certainly
not
in
belgium
where
there
are
so
many
great
beers
to
try
i
must
say
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
it
was
a
little
more
popular
so
i
could
have
it
more
often
the
bottle
was
meant
for
belgium
as
it
was
written
in
french
dutch
then
english
comissioned
there
in
1912
i
cannot
get
enough
of
this
hope
to
find
it
back
home
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
licorice
cocoa
and
some
spice
character
moderately
yeasty
particularly
on
the
midpalate
the
malt
backbone
is
quite
complex
with
a
blend
of
moderate
roast
a
little
acidic
burnt
malt
bitterness
some
burnt
sugar
and
some
molasses
drying
on
the
finish
with
some
yeast
this
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
spicy
and
yeasty
on
the
finish
this
is
enjoyable
and
im
glad
to
have
got
the
chance
to
drink
this
excellent
drinks
too
easy
i
know
i
could
come
closer
to
sessioning
on
this
versus
the
more
well
known
little
brother
bottled
or
canned
version
if
i
ever
come
across
this
i
love
to
cellar
some
to
see
how
this
ages
drinkability
great
beer
if
a
little
heavy
close
to
an
imperial
stout
great
taste
high
alcohol
and
heaviness
on
the
stomach
would
make
this
a
sipper
and
you
couldnt
have
too
many
drinkability
complex
enough
although
it
could
use
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
complexity
and
more
balanced
roastiness
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
makes
this
beer
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
considering
th
abv
and
harshness
on
the
palate
decent
price
quality
ratio
would
have
again
although
its
not
even
the
best
export
stout
in
guinnesses
catalog
the
taste
brings
a
good
dose
of
toffee
along
with
some
light
roasted
character
and
some
super
mild
espresso
following
through
after
that
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
fairly
smooth
and
slightly
dry
this
is
nice
and
easy
to
drink
the
finish
seems
to
dry
out
even
more
as
i
get
through
the
bottle
pretty
good
stuff
thanks
again
matt
well
this
is
the
strongest
variation
of
guinness
and
it
shows
beer
is
light
in
body
and
dry
on
the
finish
there
are
some
late
bitterness
and
roast
with
a
midpalate
of
mild
esters
and
some
sweetness
the
beer
is
absent
up
front
and
the
midpalate
is
quickly
eclipsed
by
the
dryness
its
mildly
alcoholic
too
but
oddly
late
in
the
palate
its
good
though
i
am
enjoying
it
but
its
not
like
any
guinness
ive
ever
had
wow
nice
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
like
tar
or
rich
corinthian
leather
initial
quaff
makes
me
thinks
i
bought
a
sherry
from
jerez
it
gave
me
some
head
and
i
appreciated
it
probably
about
one
inch
of
light
brown
foam
and
it
laced
nicely
i
feel
like
it
is
a
touch
of
brown
sugar
coffee
and
cocoa
in
both
smell
and
taste
mouth
feel
is
medium
bodiedkind
of
like
a
sandwich
on
light
whole
wheat
bread
drinkability
is
goodi
could
do
two
and
will
try
to
pick
this
up
again
i
like
this
better
than
its
cousin
that
seems
to
be
brewed
in
canada
now
this
is
an
excellent
stout
with
a
lot
going
for
it
but
the
mouthfeel
needs
to
be
improved
in
order
to
fit
the
flavor
thanks
the
beer
is
black
with
a
frothy
light
brown
head
the
nose
displays
a
dry
roasted
malt
quality
with
a
light
coffee
character
smells
like
a
nice
dry
stout
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
flavor
with
a
moderate
dry
roasted
grainy
malt
character
and
a
touch
of
nutty
character
the
beer
finishes
dry
and
light
with
a
touch
of
coffee
and
a
lingering
dry
roast
the
mouthfeel
is
full
creamy
and
dry
with
a
lower
level
of

carbonation

no

here
the
beer
tastes
so
good
this
is
what
i
always
wanted
black
albert
to
taste
like
a
belgian
stout
definitely
has
belgian
character
possibly
the
yeast
used
doesnt
seem
spiced
at
all
sweet
up

with
long
aftertastes
of

the

ive
tried
before
not
quite

heading
in

absolutely
the
best

ive
ever
had
im
so
glad

have
a

more
to

a
very

too
bad

doesnt

like

at

have
this

notes
earthy

and
a

its
the
same
ol
guinness
but
oddly
it
lacks
the
light
sour
note
one
usually
finds
in
the
flagship
beer
it
is
dry
with
medium
body
ample
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
mildly
bitter
finish
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
one
which
belies
its
8
and
one
that
has
held
up
quite
well
despite
all
the
traveling
and
time
this
bottle
has
been
subject
to
a
great
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
the
flavour
and
works
effectively
to
temper
some
of
the
flavours
the
best
guinness
product
ive
tried
d
why
the
heck
isnt
all
guinness
like
this
its
a
sipper
with
the
intense
flavor
bitterness
and
8
abv
but
otherwise
its
easy
drinking
worth
seeking
out
if
youre
ever
across
the
pond
if
only
the
regular
stuff
tasted
this
good
dnice
a
big
improvement
over
the
standard
stuff
rich
and
roasty
with
a
pleasant
bitter
bite
i
wish
this
was
more
readily
available
if
it
was
i
would
drink
guinness
more
often
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
nice
belgian
stout
much
better
then
the
regular
guinness
it
actually
has
flavor
and
its
good
creamier
and
very
soft
carbonation
a
really
warming
8
and
i
think
that
has
to
do
with
how
roasty
the
malts
come
through
in
this
really
delicious
and
its
a
shame
that
this
is
not
readily
available
in
the
us
like
some
of
the
other
export
variants
this
is
what
guinness
should
be
really
good
stuff
overall
a
good
beer
but
likely
only
to
be
purchased
for
visitors
who
cant
find
it
in
the
us
d
quite
the
conundrum
it
is
the
best
guinness
but
it
is
too
rich
to
enjoy
over
and
over
again
the
8
doesnt
really
rear
its
ugly
head
content
to
stay
in
the
background
d
hell
yeah
too
bad
that
in
holland
you
mainly
find
draught
on
tap
i
like
it
but
the
special
export
is
in
a
totally
different
class
overall
by
miles
the
best
guinness
worldwide
full
of
taste
not
a
typical
sportpub
beer
like
other
guinness
beers
but
a
beer
that
one
should
drink
at
home
with
friends
while
eating
some
nice
trappist
cheese
one
word
yes
as
bobsy
said
kind
of
an
amped
up
dry
irish
though
to
be
honest
i
was
also
disappointed
this
lacked
the
bold
roast
flavor
that
i
would
be
looking
for
focused
too
much
on
the
sweet
chocolate
and
while
certainly
complex
and
rich
in
flavor
lacked
in
body
a
nice
beer
and
miles
better
than
your
average
guiness
but
still
not
something
that
i
would
get
excited
about
thanks
again
rob
this
didnt
really
impress
me
that
much
while
it
is
a
decent
beer
its
not
in
the
same
class
as
other
foreignexport
stouts
and
it
didnt
have
the
richness
of
flavour
i
look
for
d
this
is
a
sipper
but
it
really
is
very
good
i
like
taking
each
drink
and
i
would
definitely
like
another
wow
this
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
it
certainly
was
a
nice
surprise
all
the
different
names
for
the
different
varieties
of
guinness
can
get
confusing
so
id
just
call
this
guinness
the
good
one
d
this
is
what
guinness
does
they
take
a
seemingly
simpler
beer
and
take
it
to
a
higher
level
i
am
a
fan
of
the
normal
guinness
we
americans
have
constant
access
to
but
this
taking
that
beer
much
further
still
it
brings
that
great
appearance
and
refreshing
quality
in
a
noticeably
bigger
flavor
and
aroma
wish
i
could
get
this
constantly
to
tell
you
the
truth
because
its
that
tasty
but
still
easy
drinking
damned
good
and
pleasure
to
have
been
able
to
try
drinkability
the
intense
roasted
bitterness
and
alcohol
would
make
it
better
if
ther
was
more
complexity
in
the
taste
its
almost
an
ris
but
too
simple
and
not
interesting
enough
a
33cl
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
out
of
the
fridge
and
allowed
to
warn
up
for
at
least
15
minutes
shared
with
deuane
the
stout
appears
a
dark
and
opaque
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
creamy
lingering
ecru
foam
there
is
no
evidence
of
this
beer
clocking
in
at
8
judging
by
the
aroma
and
flavor
notes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
medium
roasted
coffee
beans
caramel
a
touch
of
vanilla
milk
chocolate
pipe
tobacco
are
all
present
this
stout
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
its
a
shame
this
one
is
such
a
bitch
to
obtain
because
its
mighty
drinkable
this
feels
coarse
and
finishes
quite
dry
it
feels
like
im
eating
something
more
so
than
drinking
a
beer
pours
a
deep
cola
black
with
the
slightest
bit
of
a
ruby
outline
and
a
monstrous
three
finger
light
brown
head
crazy
webbing
left
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
huge
crown
descends
smell
consists
of
light
cocoa
powder
roasted
malts
and
some
coffee
beans
sweet
caramel
malts
vanilla
and
a
bit
of
lactose
as
well
a
metallic
aroma
is
detected
in
the
nose
too
taste
begins
with
molasses
caramel
and
brown
sugar
midway
some
smokey
flavors
emerge
with
espresso
and
cream
warm
milk
chocolate
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
but
still
extremely
low
for
a
beer
that
clocks
in
at
8
medium
to
hefty
body
with
a
rich
smooth
feel
in
the
mouth
like
i
mentioned
before
the
8
abv
is
tough
to
find
making
this
scary
drinkable
if
this
was
available
in
the
states
id
have
it
in
my
fridge
as
much
as
possible
good
stuff
glad
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
thanks
again
todd
this
8
guinness
is
very
robust
an
acquired
taste
and
once
youre
into
it
its
hard
to
resist
overall
more
complex
than
the
fe
smoother
tastier
and
better
retention
with
an
inch
of
brew
in
my
glass
there
is
yet
a
head
covering
the
surface
while
the
fe
went
relatively
flat
at
that
stage
while
i
tend
to
favour
the
american
stouts
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
uk
style
modified
for
the
belgian
market
and
i
can
certainly
admire
that
as
well
delightful
gift
from
two
loved
ones
who
went
to
belgium
when
i
couldnt
everyone
should
be
so
lucky
to
get
such
a
nice
souvenir
i
feel
fortunate
to
have
sampled
a
rare
brew
like
this
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
smooth
theres
quite
a
bit
more
malt
body
here
than
in
the
standard
guinness
we
see
in
stores
in
the
u
s
that
is
for
sure
good
steady
carbonation
makes
this
one
a
treat
overall
if
this
was
the
guinness
i
could
buy
in
the
store
here
id
be
buying
it
quite
a
bit
more
often
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sending
this
one
my
way
d
pretty
easily
drinkable
and
8
isnt
much
of
a
factor
very
glad
i
got
to
try
this
thanks
todd
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
guinness
special
export
stout
brewed
in
ireland
for
export
to
belgium
france
luxembourg
and
the
netherlands
its
a
bona
fide
classic
but
it
isnt
the
beall
and
endall
of
the
foreignexport
style
still
im
thankful
to
have
finally
acquired
this
relatively
rare
gem
thanks
to
tendermorsel
for
sending
it
my
way
intense
strong
full
hands
down
this
was
the
best
version
of
a
guinness
i
have
yet
to
try
now
if
only
this
were
available
in
the
states
d
absolutely
yes
why
we
cant
buy
this
in
the
states
im
sure
i
dont
know
a
real
treat
and
a
beer
that
shows
off
the
brewing
chops
of
the
folks
at
guinness
highly
recommended

pours
a

is

great
export
stout
this
is
the
one
that
should
be
sold
in
the
states
id
buy
it
often
if
it
were
more
available
my
wife
picked
this
beer
up
at
a
local
supermarket
in
northern
italy
it
pours
as
a
deep
blackishbrown
liquid
with
a
monstrously
fizzy
head
the
head
settles
down
quickly
but
leaves
some
pretty
lace
the
aroma
is
fantastic
chocolate
coffee
beans
very
roasted
grain
charcoal
and
a
lot
of
caramel
as
the
beer
warms
a
slight
alcohol
smell
comes
forth
as
well
the
taste
is
solidly
good
its
moderately
dry
despite
some
notable
malt
flavors
quite
a
bit
drier
than
the
foreign
extra
stout
theres
a
lot
of
bitterness
both
from
hops
and
also
from
highly
roasted
grains
the
mouthfeel
is
full
thick
and
satisfying
this
is
quite
good
and
easily
one
of
the
best
guinness
products
that
ive
had
notes
from
111805
overall
obviously
this
is
a
very
different
beer
than
their
pub
draft
they
are
not
comparable
and
are
not
meant
to
be
compared
i
could
see
how
someone
who
loves
the
pub
draft
would
not
like
this
too
bad
because
this
is
a
great
beer
on
its
own
right
its
certainly
drinkable
and
the
nose
is
sharp
and
impressive
looks
and
feels
great
too
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
how
good
gunniess
can
be
one
ill
revisit
recommended
this
is
really
an
excellent
beer
as
outstanding
as
their
pub
draught
is
bland
its
so
sad
that
this
amazing
beer
is
almost
a
footnote
for
the
guinness
brand
while
the
bland
standard
version
is
so
lauded
stock
up
before
they
stop
making
it
very
drinkable
in
general
would
rate
higher
if
not
for
that
nasty
bite
at
the
end
still
i
wish
i
could
bet
better
access
to
this

im
drinking
side
by
this
and
the
guinness
foreign
extra
this
is
less
roasty
and
has
notes
of
pitted
fruit
that
i
didnt
notice
before
plums
and
cherries
im
glad
i
did
a
comparison
pours
dark
dark
brown
out
of
the
bottle
and
settles
in
as
black
in
the
glass
with
a
huge
rocky
tan
head
that
lasted
for
ages
and
left
great
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
little
better
than
draught
with
a
slightly
more
evident
chocolate
malt
backbone
but
with
the
bitterness
i
expected
the
taste
however
was
much
more
complex
than
i
expected
it
has
the
roasted
malt
backbone
but
with
milk
chocolate
sweetness
balanced
with
some
coffee
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
very
nice
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
with
the
patented
guinness
creaminess
this
is
a
revelation
compared
to
standard
guinness
and
im
lucky
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
best
glass
i
could
get
from
the
bartender
was
a
mug
oh
well
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
looks
like
normal
guinness
the
smell
also
has
that
really
roasted
bitter
scent
but
the
flavor
is
way
different
in
a
much
better
way
its
so
much
flavorful
than
normal
guinness
flavors
of
chocolate
and
coffee
are
everywhere
it
has
a
creaminess
and
at
the
same
time
a
smoothness
that
is
remarkable
at
no
point
do
you
think
that
you
are
drinking
an
8
beer
its
a
shame
this
beer
is
not
available
in
the
states
i
guess
that
makes
it
more
of
a
treat
when
you
find
it
overseas
thanks
to

really

its
a

malty

its
smudged
i
would
say
i
prefer
classic
guiness
from
ireland
but
this
one
is
also
good
and
reminds
me
the
true
one
crafted
is
from
far
better
more
bitter
and
hoppy
than
the
normal
guinness
but
not
as
good
in
my
personal
opinion
picture
a
guiness
light
body
smooth
finish
this
beer
is
not
that
it
is
a
hoppy
version
with
different
malt
and
an
unpleasant
boozy
afterbreath
this
is
a
world
class
beer
using
an
old
irish
recipe
which
has
the
wortmash
exposed
to
wild
yeasts
this
along
with
the
use
of
high
quality
barley
malts
and
enough
hopping
to
please
an
american
palate
makes
this
beer
a
surprise
find
from
the
guinness
brewery
which
is
owned
by
the
diageo
group
read
smirnoff
the
beer
is
made
to
transport
and
because
of
this
cellars
very
well
and
even
bottle
conditions
which
producing
a
great
irish
stout
far
more
complex
malt
character
than
the
standard
version
the
alcohol
is
slightly
fusel
but
the
dark
fruit
detracts
a
really
good
stout
of
the
mass
produced
probably
one
of
the
best
overall
pretty
good
beer
and
well
worth
drinking
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
started
me
on
the
path
to
beer
geekdom
before
i
joined
beeradvocate
and
is
still
pretty
good
after
having
so
money
different
beers
overall
as
a
huge
guinness
fan
id
rank
this
1
of
the
3
ive
had
in
the
portfolio
2
would
be
the
ubiquitous
guinness
draught
and
3
the
originalregular
extra
stout
aroma
of
dark
cherry
chocolate
coffee
cocoa
barley
malts
and
cream
what
guinness
should
taste
like
very
fruity
and
leaves
your
tastebuds
dancing
the
best
from
the
guinness
range
in
my
opinion
makes
a
great
black
and
tan
with
the
local
piton
lager
too
exceptional
the
best
mass
produced
stout
in
the
world
in
my
opinion
a
truly
excellent
brew
chewy
as
as
great
stout
should
be
my
favorite
of
the
guinness
lineup
this
is
strong
and
full
of
flavor
barring
almost
no
resemblance
to
the
guinness
most
of
us
know
and
love
v
so
worth
it
youll
notice
that
there
is
guinness
extra
stout
and
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
these
both
typically
run
at
the
same
price
but
wow
is
the
foreign
variant
so
much
better
its
flavors
and
aromas
are
much
deeper
and
complex
and
quite
frankly
if
youre
paying
the
same
amount
any
way
then
it
is
entirely
a
good
value
my
favorite
in
the
guinness
line
up
great
taste
and
strong
taste
is
great
and
addictive
alcohol
really
well
hidden
smooth
and
creamy
head
and
very
drinkable
not
really
a
beer
with
deepness
just
a
good
stout
o
great
i
needs
me
some
oysters
the
extra
hops
intensify
the
charcoal
taste
that
is
common
in
all
stouts
a
little
too
much
i
would
much
rather
stick
to
the
extra
stoutoriginal
any
day
whoa
this
is
really
really
good
better
than
the
usual
extra
stout
its
rich
and
earthy
and
chocolatey
it
smells
so
fantastic
im
gonna
need
more
of
these
i
enjoy
a
guinness
draft
well
enough
but
given
a
choice
id
take
this
extra
stout
any
day
the
aroma
is
bold
and
complex
and
the
flavor
while
not
quite
as
expressive
is
still
satisfyingly
rich
with
roasted
malt
in
the
lead
sweetness
in
support
and
a
punctuating
bitterness
that
stops
shy
of
astringent
my
memory
appears
to
be
not
entirely
correct
on
this
stout
but
drinkable
enough
o
not
the
usual
guinness
stout
this
is
way
better
much
much
different
than
the
guinness
extra
we
all
know
and
love
smoother
with
a
nice
bite
this
is
a
superb
stout
overall
a
delicious
stout
that
is
easily
drinkable
yet
at
the
same
time
can
truly
give
you
warmth
from
the
inside
due
to
the
higher
abv
an
excellent
beer
that
i
hope
to
run
across
at
home
sometime
soon

mark

this

i
thought
guinness
was
garbage
until
this
beer
now
i
want
to
try
some
of
the
other
export
versions
o
this
is
a
very
good
stout
that
is
full
in
flavour
and
mouthfeel
i
am
really
enjoying
the
subtle

still
hard

miss

very

enjoyable
in
its
simplicity
the
taste
has
a

with
some

coffee
and
some
pleasant
alcohol
esters
its
a
little
thinner
in
the
style
of
an
irish
dry
stout
but
has
a
pleasant
feeling
on
the
palate
a
great
fullflavored
stout
that
packs
a
punch
overall
a
style
defining
ale
and
true
to
its
core
as
the
flavor

are
really
larger

version
hey
man
guinness
makes
a
hell
of
an
export
stout
i
cant
believe
this
is
my
first
goaround
i
will
probably
have
to
nab
this
from
timetotime
to
satiate
my
desire
for
a
good
stout
which
this
is
tm
again
what
i
always
wished
guinness
stout
was
its
like
an
upgrade
very
much
like
the
smell
the
chocolate
is
the
first
sensation
i
get
followed
by
coffee
once
swallowed
a
bit
sweet
from
the
malts
and
alcohol
but
a
nice
hop
bitterness
lingers
above
the
sweetness
im
not
quite
sure
how
to
describe
this
beer
its
like
guinness
bet
yet
very
different
the
flavor
is
similar
to
your
standard
guinness
stout
minus
the
typical
chocolate
malt
flavor
instead
you
get
a
bit
more
hops
its
actually
rather
pleasant
and
unexpected
also
the
alcohol
content
is
quite
a
bit
higher
compared
to
guinness
i
had
no
idea
until
i
started
to
get
rather
buzzed
after
1
beer
then
i
read
the
label
and
noticed
the
higher
alcohol
content
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
thin
foamy
head
it
doesnt
stay
for
long
and
theres
little
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
chocolate
malt
and
bread
big
taste
of
coffee
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
licorice
a
bit
of
bitterness
medium
mouth
with
some
oil
just
a
nice
solid
stout
this
is
quite
good
certainly
better
than
the
standard
guinness
draught
not
quite
on
par
with
the
better
american
stouts
and
the
sourness
is
a
little
offputting
overall
great
beer
for
this
cold
boston
weather
too
bad
it
only
comes
in
4
packs
they
should
expand
to
6
packs
o
this
is
a
bigger
version
of
guinness
stout
however
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
well
in
colder
months
or
a
night
capper
with
a
creme
brulee
or
sweet
dessert
very
enjoyable
this
is
the
gold
standard
of
stouts
not
to
be
confused
with
the
other
guinness
extra
stoutthis
is
the
real
deal
to
be
sipped
and
savored
its
simply
delicious
best
enjoyed
by
itself
or
maybe
with
some
salted
nuts
because
you
wont
want
anything
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
awesome
taste
this
is
a
great
beer
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
it
had
a
little
more
coffeechocolate
taste
its
too
heavy
to
drink
in
the
summer
its
definitely
a
winter
beer
and
even
then
i
couldnt
drink
many
but
ill
enjoy
each
one
overall
just
above
average
i
definitely
prefer
the
ease
and
accessibility
of
regular
guinness
however
if
you
like
bold
bittersweet
beers
you
might
just
enjoy
it
this
will
not
be
a
repurchase
overall
a
powerhouse
of
a
stout
o
overall
this
is
a
very
good
stout
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
hard
to
beat
this
beer
the
foreign
extra
stout
poured
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
full
tan
head
with
great
retention
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
weaker
than
expected
from
such
a
foreboding
brew
but
was
reminiscent
of
a
regular
guinness
the
foreign
extra
stout
takes
those
signature
guinness
flavors
and
turns
them
up
to
11
there
are
hints
of
chocolate
sweet
malts
and
a
slight
char
that
leaves
a
nice
bitterness
on
the
palate
it
has
a
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
is
heavier
than
the
regular
guinness
but
still
lighter
than
expected
the
foreign
extra
stout
is
the
epitome
of
guinness
and
so
good
omuch
better
stout
flavor
than
the
original
would
love
to
have

the

reminds

the

circles
often
makes
the
more

this

delivers
with
a

and

belies

sip
a
shame
this
beer
does
not

strong

packtrade
the
harp
for
this
in
a
heartbeat
this
foreign
extra
brought
me
back
to
when
i
first
enjoyed
a
dark
brew
which
was
schlizt
dark
draught
i
have
loved
dark
brews
ever
since
that
time
this
extra
has
a
good
character
and
was
balanced
well
very
less
heavy
than
regular
guinness
draught
can
not
mention
anything
about
lacing
as
i
just
enjoyed
it
in
the
bottle
i
had
this
brew
in
shenzhen
china
and
will
try
to
get
a
local
pub
to
get
it
here
in
fl
i
really
like
this
guinness
foreign
extra
ive
had
guinness
on
5
continents
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
even
if
the
best
before
date
was
a
year
ago
overall
a
decent
stout
but
i
would
much
rather
go
for
the
sam
smiths
equivalent
o
in
my
opinion
this
is
much
better
than
the
runofthemill
guinness
draught
you
get
around
these
parts
ive
never
been
to
ireland
so
i
cant
comment
on
how
this
differs
from
getting
it
local
excellent
stout
o
its
been
said
before
but
im
going
to
say
it
again
this
is
the
pride
of
the
guinness
line
this
is
leagues
ahead
of
the
guinness
stout
thats
on
tap
in
most
commercial
bars
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
treat
that
id
go
for
time
after
time
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
unlike
traditional
guinness
this
beer
is
strong
with
lots
of
flavor
while
not
as
well
balanced
as
guinness
lager
this
is
a
truly
a
strong
and
flavorful
beer
immensely
popular
in
many
parts
of
the
world
this
dark
strong
beer
is
still
drank
year
round
often
only
marginally
cold
dark
almost
black
body
with
a
thick
oneinch
foamy
light
brown
head
which
eventually
gives
way
to
leave
enormous
chunks
of
foam
on
the
glass
smell
is
largely
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
roasted
grain
the
taste
is
bitter
chocolate
with
sour
notes
and
a
dry
finish
that
leaves
a
touch
of
bitterness
behind
the
feel
is
remarkably
light
with
a
medium
tangy
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
a
welcome
bitter
chocolate
that
lingers
for
many
minutes
after
consumption
o
this
is
a
really
nice
straight
up
stout
these
days
it
seems
like
everyone
is
adding
something
to
a
stout
or
aging
it
in
a
barrel
every
now
an
then
you
need
to
be
reminded
of
what
the
style
should
fundamentally
be
and
i
think
guinness
hit
it
with
this
beer
highly
recommended
o
a
go
to
beer
for
all
the
stout
lovers
and
that
includes
me
an
interesting
export
stout
surprising
level
of
herbal
spicy
bitterness
a
lot
of
rich
alcohol
soaked
coffee
and
herbal
spice
character
all
balanced
quite
well
interesting
complexity
and
good
feel
yet
i
would
hesitate
to
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
a
bit
herbalbooze
forward
though
balanced
with
a
nice
dry
fruity
finish
a
very
good
beer
but
not
my
favourite
style
of
stout
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
that
is
almost
nothing
like
the
guinness
nitro
stuff
that
can
be
found
at
every
bar
and
grocery
store
in
town
this
is
a
big
chewy
brew
to
be
sipped
not
swilled
a
nice
companion
to
the
eminently
sessionable
regular
guinness
o
its
been
at
least
a
few
years
since
ive
had
this
having
had
a
good
number
of
fine
stouts
from
around
the
world
in
the
meantime
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
certainly
exceeded
my
expectations
surprisingly
satisfying
and
flavorful
given
the
standardcommon
guinness
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
super
creamy
brown
head
aromas
of
roasted
coffee
taste
begins
with
a
bit
of
molassas
then
some
pumpernickle
bread
then
some
smooth
chocolate
and
earthy
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
overall
a
very
nice
beer
easily
the
best
offering
guinness
has
an
interesting
beer
though
i
guess
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
it
frankly
given
a
choice
i
think
i
prefer
the
lower
alcohol
draft
version
of
this
beer
nevertheless
im
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
it
overall
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
will
probably
be
buying
a
6
pack
soon
o
a
classic
irish
stout
with
wonderful
dark
characteristics
and
smoothness
happy
to
take
this
brew
in
on
st
patricks
hope
everyone
is
staying
safe
out
there
with
a
much
more
bold
flavor
than
guinness
extra
and
the
smoothness
of
guinness
draught
this
is
the
beerlovers
guinness
if
only
it
were
easier
to
get
in
aus
poured
into
a

which
lasted
well

as
would
be
expected
from
guinness
and
laced

guinness
aroma
was
strong
of
coffee
and

and
hop
perhaps
a
hint
of

taste
was
coffee
and
dry
hop
mouthfeel
was
full
and
a
bit
carbonated

was
super
dry
overall
great
stout
the
best
beer
that
guinness
makes
and
one
of
my
favorite
stouts

o
overall
guinness
simply
does
not
brew
great
beers
in
my
opinion
it
wasnt
bad
bit
it
definitely
wasnt
sepctacular
stout
where
outstanding
feel
like
i
should
have
been
drinking
this
for
years
time
to
play
catch
up
overallgood
not
great
with
all
the
other
offering
around
at
this

you
can

do
better

i
have
to
admit
i
wasnt
expecting
much
with
this
one
but
im
very
pleasantly
surprised
as
its
rapidly
risen
of
the
ranks
of
my
favorite
beers
not
really
a
session
beer
as
its
quite
complex
and
demands
you
attention
but
perfect
now
and
again
either
on
its
own
perhaps
a
third
beer
to
wake
up
a
numbing
tongue
or
with
a
heavy
meaty
dish
including
jerky
cheers
wow
i
must
admit
that
i
was
not
expecting
this
there
is
a
dark
chocolaty
flow
into
my
glass
with
a
lovely
whipped
mocha
head
the
flavor
is
of
hint
of
a
stale
dark
roast
and
a
yummy
tobacco
i
feel
that
my
mouth
i
content
while
it
goes
away
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
weird
feeling
that
make
you
want
to
take
another
sip
asap
this
is
worth
it
weight
in
gold
or
atleast
coffee
overall
though
i
am
astonished
at
how
good
this
is
for
a
commercial
offering

nice

strong

than
i
had

the
roasted

isnt
overpowering
and
the
alcohol
is
not
very
apparent
o
pretty
damn
good
and
shocked
this
comes
from
guinness
highly
drinkable
and
by
far
the
best
product
ive
had
from
them
overall
by
far
the
finest
version
of
guinness
stout
smooth
full
flavor
great
appearance
the
finest
that
guinness
has
to
offer
highly
recommend
o
an
excellent
export
stout
if
you
love
the
dry
burnt
quality
of
guinness
ive
been
looking
for
this
for
a
while
it
finally
showed
up
anyways
poured
from
a
33cl
bottle
into
a
guinness
mug
coded

date
pours
a
pitch
black
beautiful
color
with
a
massive
three
fourths
the
mug
mocha
colored
head
which
is
slowly
receding
to
the
body
below
after
a
while
this
leaves
a
two
finger
thick
head
with
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
dark
roasted
malts
the
guinness
burnt
smells
a
little
hops
the
feel
is
somewhere
between
medium
to
thick
and
creamy
very
nice
the
taste
is
outstanding
plenty
of
dark
roasted
malts
combined
with
a
noticeable
hop
bite
and
a
little
alcohol
burn
this
is
pretty
great
better
than
the
original
o
ok
this
is
what
guinness
should
be
their
best
product
by
far
and
a
million
times
better
than
the
pub
draft
crap
that
most
people
associate
with
the
brand
so
good
it
made
me
want
to
go
to
the
fridge
and
get
another
bottle
right
away
could
be
the
best
example
of
just
a
regular
stout
and
its
just
splendid
o
whoa
this
is
probably
what
all
stouts
should
aspire
to
be
im
amazed
by
this
beer
loving
it
and
cant
wait
to
crack
another
overall
this
is
the
best
guinness
that
i
have
had
out
of
a
bottle
not
as
good
as
a
guinness
draught
on
nitrotap
but
pretty
close
say
what
you
want
about
them
but
guinness
really
does
make
a
nice
product
both
tasty
and
accessible
this
is
probably
the
best
brew
in
their
lineup
and
at
7
5
abv
its
definitely
their
strongest
be
careful
or
this
one
will
sneak
up
on
you
this
was
a
really
nice
variation
on
the
guinness
brand
the
hoppy
bitterness
was
a
nice
addition
the
usual
guinness
palate
that
im
used
to
overall
really
nice
beer
far
superior
to
regular
guinness
has
alot
of
flavor
balance
and
easy
to
enjoy
this
is
awhole
different
beer
then
guinness
draught
but
still
has
the
flavor
and
feel
nice
glad
it
came
to
the
states
worth
a
try
as
far
as
guiness
beers
go
this
is
really
the
only
one
you
should
be
drinking
its
a
damn
near
perfect
stout
and
yes
i
feel
weird
typing
this
but
i
cant
help
it
it
really
is
that
good
as
ridiculous
as
it
sounds
it
feels
as
if
they
paid
a
smaller
brewer
to
make
this
for
them
and
stick
their
name
on
it
it
is
that
hard
to
believe
that
they
made
something
this
good
this
brew
is
a
bit
more
flavorful
and
intense
than
its
normal
version
and
it
boasts
a
higher
abv
as
well
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
is
a
nice
big
beer
which
should
definitely
be
savored
overall
the
taste
and
feel
start
out
great
but
that
off
bitterherbalroasted
flavor
that
is
left
on
the
tongue
really
bring
the
brew
down
bought
a
bottle
from
total
wine
in
de
poured
into
a
classic
guiness
glass
looks
black
with
very
nice
carbonation
and
mountainous
head
that
sticks
around
forever
foam
clings
to
side
of
glass
smells
bittersweet
as
in
the
label
description
with
roasty
notes
and
hints
of
candied
fig
some
caramel
molasses
notes
tastes
very
dry
with
bittersweet
notes
and
candied
figs
dark
fruit
and
some
molasses
alcohol
seems
well
hidden
i
love
the
texture
seems
light
because
of
the
dryness
but
feels
about
medium
to
full
overall
a
nice
variation
of
the
standard
guiness
product
glad
to
have
seen
this
one
arrive
in
the
us
just
pissed
i
didnt
try
this
one
sooner
than
a
draught
which
i
quite
enjoy
shoots
to
the
top
of
my
stout
list
o
very
nice
beer
for
anyone
who
enjoys
the
regular
guinness
but
wants
to
try
something
on
a
whole
new
level
this
beer
is
a
great
stout
that
everyone
should
give
a
try
at
least
once
a
proper
beer
for
a
beer
enthusiast
cheers
o
guinness
was
what
i
drank
wheni
was
unfamiliar
with
craft
beer
but
wanted
to
seem
more
sophisticated
than
everyone
else
who
was
drinking
bud
turns
out
regular
guinness
is
not
that
great
a
beer
fortunately
there
is
the
foreign
exportstout
versions
and
it
is
a
facesaver
for
the
most
wellknown
brewery
in
dublin
while
there
are
plenty
of
better
stouts
the
guinness
foreign
extra
is
a
good
irish
dry
stout
if
you
like
craft
beer
and
youve
had
the
regular
version
of
the
beer
then
you
must
seek
this
out
and
have
one
its
an
important
representative
in
the
house
of
stouts
and
a
good
beer
to
be
familiar
with
very
dry
finish
the
finishes
with
some
acrid
notes
and
a
spicy
noble
bitterness
that
lingers
along
with
that
dark
caramel
note
this
example
seems
to
set
the
bar
for
foreign
extra
stout
overall
i
love
this
stuff
i
keep
a
couple
in
the
frig
for
whenever
i
get
tired
of
the
same
ole
same
ole
not
for
every
night
not
for
anytime
but
every
once
in
a
while
these
are
the
prescription
for
what
ails
ya
maybe
try
a
back
of
some
good
whiskey
for
a
great
evening
home
alone
sorry
im
a
loner
cant
give
it
all
5s
is
there
anything
in
the
world
which
really
is
except
for
freely
given
passionate
oral
gratitude
but
this
is
one
of
my
tops
salud
cheers
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
ever
had
it
blows
guinness
extra
stout
out
of
the
water
this
is
going
to
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
for
sure
o
im
pretty
much
blown
away
because
i
didnt
think
this
was
going
to
be
this
good
this
is
quite
impressive
however
i
still
feel
as
each
new
style
presents
itself
to
me
that
i
need
to
have
others
just
so
i
can
compare
overall
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
i
was
surprised
that
such
a
world
renowned
beer
brand
could
deliver
such
a
tasty
and
well
balanced
beer
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
overall
this
is
the
perfect
example
of
a
stout
it
just
goes
above
and
beyond
in
every
catagory
and
really
is
a
treat
to
drink
it
is
refreshing
and
warming
at
the
same
time
if
that
is
at
all
possible
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
stout
with
a
nice
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
light
sweet
notes
is
pretty
good
taste
is
a
nice
mix
between
some
solid
roasted
malt
with
dry
notes
and
some
light
sweet
undertones
body
has
somewhat
of
a
creamy
texture
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
this
is
definitely
a
stepup
from
the
regular
guinness
this
is
without
question
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
the
only
part
about
it
that
was
less
than
fantastic
was
the
bottle
was
only
11
2
oz
it
pours
a
deep
dark
opaque
brown
nearly
black
smells
roasty
almost
but
not
quite
like
coffee
its
hoppy
and
strong
smooth
on
the
tongue
i
cant
say
enough
this
is
truly
a
special
beer
o
this
is
pretty
good
much
better
then
the
watery
stuff
we
get
here
in
the
us
i
also
dont
think
my
bottle
was
that
fresh
so
i
was
somewhat
optimistic
in
my
rating
the
body
is
a
tad
thin
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
version
of
guinness
that
is
available
i
havent
had
many
fes
but
this
one
was
a
treat
i
think
i
like
this
better
than
the
original
a
very
nice
different
beer
mi
found
myself
drinking
quite
slowly
and
savoring
each
sip
fairly
full
bodied
light
effervescence
fairly
smooth
and
creamy
as
well
much
much
better
than
regular
guinness
i
would
have
this
again
willingly
o
absolutely
drinkable
great
beer
recommended
the
pour
yield
a
jet
black
nearly
opaque
body
its
croundedxwith
a
whispy
light
tan
head
there
is
coffee
and
cocao
powder
in
the
nose
the
malt
is
definatly
roasted
and
is
pretty
nice
but
not
over
bearing
or
bitter
the
taste
does
have
some
bite
between
the
medium
carbonation
and
body
movin
into
the
malt
it
carries
a
big
taste
without
the
big
characteristics
with
makes
it
approachable
a
solid
brew
and
about
as
sessionable
as
the
style
permits
11
2oz
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
pours
black
with
a
frothy
beige
head
that
leaves
good
retention
and
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
chocolate
nibs
roasted
barley
molasses
and
caramel
tastes
are
molasses
roasty
sweet
dark
chocolate
delicately
hopped
yet
has
a
roasty
bitterness
lots
of
fig
and
date
in
there
as
well
mouth
is
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
but
is
creamy
and
smooth
overall
one
of
the
better
foreign
stouts
out
there
guinness
needs
to
just
brew
this
one
its
by
far
their
best
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
chocolate
brown
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
roast
in
the
taste
a
small
roast
and
a
small
bite
a
small
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
small
roast
in
the
aftertaste
eh
lack
of
flavor
and
aroma
honestly
nothing
exciting
at
all
o
interesting
foreign
stout
its
mostly
char
and
dark
fruits
almost
no
coffee
or
chocolate
fairly
bitter
even
with
a
year
on
it
its
not
terrible
but
not
what
i
typically
look
for
in
a
stout
i
think
i
prefer
regular
guiness
draught
over
this
amusingly
enough
overall
alcohol
was
well
hidden
so
this
drank
easy
a
good
stout
id
drink
it
again
o
the
staple
of
the
style
complex
in
flavor
mouthfeel
nose
and
even
the
appearance
is
perfect
this
is
quite
a
beer
i
have
to
say
im
sold
huge
fan
of
this
poured
into
an
irish
style
pint
glasses
very
dark
brown
color
medium
sized
white
head
lots
of
roasted
notes
in
the
nose
taste
was
much
more
rich
than
the
traditional
guinness
mouthfeel
was
also
thicker
and
you
could
really
notice
the
additional
alcohol
also
not
as
bitter
as
the
extra
stout
available
in
the
us
but
this
seems
to
be
less
memorable
than
the
same
fes
i
had
down
in
the
caribbean
not
as
exotic
o
so
much
different
from
the
guinness
draught
that
we
are
all
accustomed
to
granted
its
a
different
style
but
it
hits
that
style
on
the
head
delicious
beer
overall
not
that
much
different
than
the
guinness
extra
stout
which
is
widely
available
and
at
a
lower
price
id
say
this
ones
a
tad
smoother
but
the
difference
is
nearly
negligible
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
for
what
it
is
flavorful
and
complex
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
at
only
7
5
abv
oive
heard
of
this
beer
and
when
i
finally
saw
it
i
jumped
at
it
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
trying
and
i
like
it
sweeter
almost
a
bit
like
an
imperial
milk
stout
if
you
want
a
big
west
coast
style
impy
stout
like
some
this
is
not
it
but
it
is
a
good
beer
shit
if
they
poured
this
out
of
the
guiness
taps
at
all
the
bars
i
would
definitely
reach
for
it
my
heavyhanded
pour
caused
me
a
moment
of
consternation
as
i
thought
that
it
was
going
to
overflow
the
rim
of
the
glass
as
it
seemed
to
cascade
the
dense
deeptan
head
looked
like
the
top
of
an
ice
cream
float
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with
cola
highlights
at
the
edges
the
nose
was
very
chocolaty
with
an
underlying
roastiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
definite
hoproasted
barley
bite
on
the
tongue
this
taste
along
with
its
relatively
high
abv
was
a
real
revelation
for
this
selfavowed
hophead
this
was
not
a
black
ipa
but
instead
a
hoppy
dry
stout
wow
finish
was
very
dry
almost
gaspingly
so
and
i
could
not
wait
until
my
next
sip
definitely
worth
giving
a
try
poured
into
a
guinness
pint
glass
pours
dark
brown
with
a
massive
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
leaving
plenty
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
dominate
theres
also
a
hint
of
extra
sweetness
in
the
smell
the
flavor
is
sweeter
than
the
classic
guinness
flavor
with
an
extra
punch
from
the
alcohol
there
are
flavors
of
dark
roasted
malt
bitter
chocolate
and
molasses
this
is
a
bolder
version
of
the
guinness
weve
all
enjoyed
and
the
flavors
are
still
well
balanced
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
and
creamy
like
the
original
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
an
excellent
irish
stout
and
easily
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
the
style
if
you
like
the
regular
guinness
you
could
not
go
wrong
trying
this
one
favorite
beers
for
comparison
after
all
taste
preferences
are
subjective
elysians

i

with

guiness
foreign
extra
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
not
quite
black
color
with
a
thick
milk
chocolate
colored
head
from
a
brown
330
ml
bottle
dark
malts
are
present
in
the
aroma
lots
of
dark
malt
in
the
flavor
even
a
hint
of
caramel
definitely
stronger
than
the
original
in
both
flavor
and
alcohol
sweeter
too
this
bottle
came
from
the
caribbean
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
offering
has
to
be
the
best
irish
stout
i
have
had
miles
ahead
of
any
other
offering
by
guinness
thats
for
sure
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
could
get
your
hands
on
it
overall
i
dont
care
for
guinness
but
this
well
this
was
just
delightful
o
i
like
this
beer
typical
of
guiness
a
good
dry
stout
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
this
has
a
richer
fuller
flavor
than
draft
making
it
a
better
stout
sometimes
you
are
just
in
the
mood
for
a
guiness
this
is
the
one
i
will
go
to
when
i
have
that
feeling
11
2oz
bottle
pours
black
with
a
short
lived
brown
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
of
roasted
grain
bready
malt
and
some
chocolate
body
is
full
smooth
and
oily
roasted
grain
chocolate
malt
some
dark
fruit
and
a
lot
of
earthy
hops
fill
the
mouth
the
finish
is
long
and
bitter
i
cant
say
i
enjoyed
this
brew
palate
is
big
on
rich
dark
roasted
malt
tempered
slightly
by
a
lactic
sweetness
and
a
very
mild
fruity
hop
profile
notes
of
mocha
and
bittersweet
chocolate
a
slight
sour
funk
comes
through
on
the
finish
rounding
out
the
sweetness
in
a
surprisingly
nice
way
body
is
rich
creamy
velvety
and
just
about
perfect
this
is
like
guinness
taken
up
a
notch
and
even
without
the
nitro
widget
to
add
extra
creaminess
its
thoroughly
excellent
d
a
fine
example
of
the
style
especially
considering
the
largescale
brewing
process
commendable
o
a
massive
improvement
over
the
draught
high
drinkability
with
a
pretty
high
abv
its
a
damn
solid
beer
nothing
too
complex
or
over
the
top
just
a
clean
and
simple
stout
which
makes
its
104
pack
price
seem
a
bit
excessive
m
gritty
hoppy
sharp
from
malt
o
extremely
good
stout
very
complex
yet
not
overwhelming
o
really
good
and
very
happy
that
i
picked
this
up
much
better
than
i
remember
guinness
draught
being
o
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
traditional
guinness
draught
this
beer
is
more
brooding
more
complex
in
its
roasted
characteristics
and
much
more
potent
at
7
5
abv
yet
still
retains
that
smooth
easytodrink
status
that
guinness
is
renowned
for
o
very
nice
a
creamy
and
bitter
treat
o
guinesss
best
offering
by
far
delicious
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
guinness
but
my
name
is
kevin
and
i
have
a
red
beard
so
i
feel
obligated
to
find
an
irish
beer
that
i
like
i
have
had
regular
guinness
and
was
not
to
impressed
i
bought
this
beer
on
a
whim
and
came
home
to
see
that
it
had
good
reviews
i
wanted
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
st
pattys
and
this
might
make
the
cut
i
was
not
let
down
with
the
taste
drinkabilty
smell
or
what
ever
else
this
was
one
that
we
should
have
had
in
this
country
long
long
before
im
sure
they
missed
out
on
a
lot
of
profit
by
holding
this
back
from
the
u
s
they
should
have
seen
the
boom
in
micros
a
long
time
ago
and
taken
notice
cheers
get
it
get
it
while
you
can
o
nice
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
coffee
bitterness
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
overall
this
reminds
me
of
regular
guinness
but
with
more
flavor
and
carbonation
and
a
less
smooth
character
o
i
still
have
yet
to
try
the
original
guinness
draught
but
this
one
was
very
good
the
only
thing
i
could
ask
for
was
a
bigger
nose
the
look
and
the
finish
are
what
makes
this
beer
this
is
really
a
great
beer
it
is
quite
rich
and
fulfilling
all
without
being
too
heavy
or
overbearing
a
top
notch
stout
that
i
will
return
to
again
and
again
surprisingly
this
is
stocked
at
my
local
wal
mart
as
advertised
guinness
foreign
extra
is
a
more
roasted
and
hopped
up
version
of
their
excellent
extra
stout
here
your
extra
1
00
per
bottle
buys
you
a
1
5
higher
abv
some
nice
dark
rum
notes
and
that
fantastic
dark
rum
truffle
finish
excellent
for
special
occasions
or
when
you
want
to
savor
a
well
crafted
irish
dry
stout
o
awesome
hard
to
find
near
me
so
im
glad
i
picked
up
some
of
this
when
i
did
see
it
ill
recommend
to
anyone
into
stouts
and
ill
definitely
grab
again
overall
it
was
very
nice
for
me
this
and
the
extra
stout
were
pretty
comparable
both
quite
a
bit
better
than
regular
guinness
overall
this
is
my
favorite
from
guinness
not
for
the
non
stout
drinkers
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
dont
quite
match
up
to
the
robust
smell
still
a
great
stout
overall
very
tasty
strong
stout
with
a
superb
aroma
a
bit
more
depth
of
roast
in
the
flavor
would
be
wonderful
overall
this
may
be
overwhelming
for
people
who
are
not
used
to
dark
beers
or
if
they
think
guinness
is
a
meal
in
and
of
itself
one
the
other
hand
if
you
like
dark
beers
give
this
one
a
try
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
will
return
to
overall
definitely
an
addition
to
the
guinness
line
up
that
i
can
stand
behind
my
favorite
bottled
guinness
thus
far
o
fantastic
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
o
what
a
beer
that
came
out
of
left
field
i
never
thought
id
be
this
impressed
with
a
guinness
but
i
have
been
proven
wrong
id
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
o
overall
a
decent
beer
its
quite
drinkable
but
a
little
on
the
weak
side
as
far
as
taste
and
mouthfeel
go
creamy
mild
with
just
enough
carbonation
to
sweep
her
down
your
tongue
the
mouth
feel
on
this
baby
is
near
perfect
o
its
not
perfect
but
its
genuinely
impressive
especially
next
to
regular
old
guinness
draught
the
thin
body
lets
it
down
a
tad
but
this
is
still
a
really
good
stout
that
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
in
the
future
o
awesome
stout
what
every
stout
should
strive
to
be
soo
smooth
and
tasty
o
this
is
by
far
guinness
best
product
this
is
a
very
satisfying
product
o
this
is
a
good
stout
better
than
the
guinness
draught
or
guinness
extra
stout
there
is
more
malt
character
to
balance
the
bitterness
very
creamy
malty
and
roasted
wish
i
could
find
this
ontap
again
this
is
an
awesome
beer
guinness
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
getting
me
into
the
dark
beers
to
begin
with
but
with
that
bias
aside
this
is
real
good
stout
nice
subtle
chocolate
with
a
real
rich
maltiness
not
many
beers
beat
the
look
of
this
one
this
is
a
delicious
fullflavored
stout
my
favourite
guinness
brew
so
far
overall
what
a
guinness
should
taste
like
solid
as
a
regular
stout
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
like
regular
guiness
stout
and
i
liked
this
even
more
i
would
def
buy
again
i
am
finally
getting
around
to
sampling
this
renowned
beer
i
have
seen
it
on
and
off
on
the
shelves
in
the
past
but
just
never
picked
it
up
each
time
due
to
various
reasons
the
pour
was
deep
brown
coming
out
of
the
bottle
but
in
the
glass
it
looked
very
black
the
head
that
formed
showed
the
classic
cascading
action
to
grow
to
four
or
five
fingers
thick
before
settling
down
to
a
large
mass
crowing
above
the
rim
of
the
pint
glass
the
aroma
was
roasty
and
robust
with
a
generous
helping
of
coffee
brown
sugar
and
toffee
the
taste
was
excellently
balanced
between
cream
chocolate
coffee
and
molasses
flavors
not
as
aggressive
as
many
newer
variations
of
the
style
but
very
approachable
as
a
result
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
the
carbonation
made
it
feel
silky
smooth
from
my
reading
about
the
history
of
guinness
this
is
probably
closest
to
the
original
recipe
from
last
century
than
the
watered
down
mainstream
variant
sold
today
people
had
it
better
back
then
o
very
different
than
standard
guinness
i
like
it
almost
a
black
ipa
i
could
drink
more
of
this
notes
an
interesting
stout
but
nothing
special
in
compariosn
to
what
else
is
available
now
ill
admit
this
is
a
poor
review
i
usually
do
that
when
im
indifferent
to
a
beer
taste
is
strong
even
a
little
bitter
with
flavors
of
burnt
barley
and
crisp
hops
present
too
not
your
usual
guinness
though
it
does
retain
some
of
the
creamy
body
of
the
usual
guinness
this
is
a
sturdy
strong
and
bitter
ale
thats
unique
and
welldone
ill
be
revisiting
in
the
future
big
juicy
malt
and
dark
fruit
character
lots
of
prune
juice
and
fermentation
stuff
happening
nice
but
it
overpowers
any
dark
malt
roast
or
dryness
disappointing
really
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
having
had
guinness
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
i
must
say
this
is
my
fav
at
7
5
abv
i
would
never
guess
it
very
easyanxious
to
drink
i
would
drink
this
more
regulary
if
the
price
was
better
will
definitely
buy
again
and
recommend
to
others
over
all
i
that
it
was
hohum
overall
my
kind
of
guinness
thick
and
chewy
with
a
fine
high
alcohol
edge
that
doesnt
overpower
the
complex
flavors
a
stout
that
makes
you
take
notice
and
will
keep
you
coming
back
overall
an
excellent
beer
with
a
unique
combination
of
sour
and
dark
its
like
guinness
concentrate
with
a
slug
of
brett
which
i
believe
they
do
use
im
not
sure
what
pisses
me
off
more
the
fact
that
guinness
has
been
holding
this
stuff
back
from
us
for
so
long
or
the
fact
that
they
are
charging
9
99
a
4pack
of
eleven
point
two
fluid
ounce
bottles
cmon
guys
just
because
its
7
5
doesnt
mean
it
warranted
a
smaller
portion
size
and
a
higher
pricetag
at
least
give
us
six
packs
of
12oz
bottles
for
14
or
something
overall
this
is
a
very
very
enjoyable
to
drink
and
taste
i
drink
the
guinness
extra
stout
on
a
regular
basis
as
its
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
this
one
is
an
every
once
in
awhile
beer
that
has
a
little
bit
more
bite
to
it
its
pricey
8
95
for
only
4
bottles
but
every
once
in
awhile
its
very
well
worth
the
price
its
a
great
beer
if
you
like
dark
beers
and
stouts
please
try
this
next
time
you
see
it
it
poured
with
a
fairly
thick
and
dense
mellow
tan
head
its
a
very
dark
brown
that
when
held
up
to
a
light
allows
none
through
it
its
of
roasted
malts
faint
coffee
and
vanilla
it
tasted
of
these
malts
and
a
little
vanilla
chocolate
and
strongly
of
molasses
fair
carbonation
leads
to
an
alright
creamy
mouthfeel
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
thats
one
of
my
favorites
wow
calling
it
a
benchmark
guinness
has
brought
it
strong
on
this
one
ya
know
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
complex
and
fully
flavored
yet
light
enough
to
drink
well
but
probably
kinda
dangerous
overall
a
very
substantial
stout
unlike
any
other
stout
i
have
hadthis
one
packs
a
punch
let
this
one
warm
some
for
a
better
drinking
experience
the
beer
is
poured
a
black
color
with
touches
of
brown
and
red
along
the
sides
of
glass
a
thick
inch
and
half
high
head
forms
creamy
beige
in
color
that
settles
on
top
and
goes
no
where
a
sweet
dark
bread
fragrance
is
there
at
the
start
followed
by
dried
fruit
and
some
raisons
with
a
touch
of
coffee
the
aroma
does
finish
with
yeasty
sort
of
twang
at
the
end
making
your
nose
twitch
slightly
the
dark
bread
from
the
aroma
hits
the
palate
in
the
taste
right
off
the
bat
that
then
blends
to
a
yeasty
twang
the
taste
finishes
with
a
burnt
grain
bitterness
and
hoppy
bitterness
of
citrus
and
grass
a
thin
watery
feel
that
gains
weight
as
it
crosses
the
palate
finishing
with
mild
dryness
at
the
end
this
beer
was
not
what
i
expected
the
feel
stayed
the
same
for
a
guinness
and
the
color
was
probably
darker
than
the
usual
offering
the
things
that
made
this
different
were
the
taste
and
aroma
both
of
which
were
much
better
than
the
typical
pint
you
would
get
anywhere
else
a
very
good
beer

after

at
first
but
slowly
fades
half
way
threw
the
glass
overall
after
years
of
not
being
available
in
america
guinness
has
impressed
me
with
this
fine
piece
of
brewed
heaven
i
can
say
foreign
extra
is
for
guinness
lovers
and
real
beer
drinkers
alike
hopefully
in
the
future
this
will
replace
extra
stout
on
the
taps
everywhere
good
beer
overall
i
think
ive
said
enough
in
the
above
this
is
a
traditional
style
and
i
tend
to
favor
the
nontraditional
lunatic
styles
of
beer
having
said
that
i
still
think
this
beer
is
exceptional
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
that
ive
had
incredible
balance
and
wonderful
uniqueness
i
like
this
beer
will
it
replace
my
imperial
or
american
stouts
nope
but
i
probably
will
pick
up
another
bottle
the
next
time
im
at
the
store
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
great
beer
i
will
definately
buy
it
again
as
it
is
a
great
go
to
stout
for
a
decent
price
a
tasty
although
not
sessionable
brew
the
abv
would
get
to
me
after
a
few
of
these
i
like
this
though
very
tasty
and
a
nice
fall
sipper
do
not
super
tasty
or
complex
but
rather
drinkable
the
thin
mouthfeel
detracts
a
bit
though
glad
to
try
and
much
better
than
regular
guinness
its
really
great
when
you
can
take
a
classic
and
make
some
improvements
on
it
except
for
the
butterscotch
thing
which
i
just
cant
abide
poured
with
a
mammoth
thick
foamy
frothy
fluffy
billowy
light
tan
head
that
lasts
forever
and
lots
of
clingy
lace
color
is
an
opaque
black
brown
aroma
is
a
complex
array
of
roast
malt
acid
butterscotch
masculine
scents
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
with
very
little
sweetness
bitterness
and
tang
dominate
with
some
butterscotch
malt
roast
barest
hint
of
toffee
and
sweetness
man
this
is
dry
irish
stout
body
is
perfect
and
so
is
carbonation
for
the
style
finish
is
like
flavor
and
some
coffee
and
cocoa
show
up
fairly
long
an
alternate
to
a
world
classic
for
the
far
flungs
markets
of
diageo
o
ive
never
had
a
guinness
i
didnt
like
and
this
is
no
exception
though
i
think
i
still
prefer
the
default
guinness
draught
variety
this
is
a
nice
way
to
mix
it
up
a
bit
and
still
have
a
top
quality
stout
after
having
this
stout
twice
i
can
say
that
it
is
not
finding
its
way
into
my
cellar
again
out
of
the
two
styles
of
guinness
i
have
had
i
shall
stick
to
the
draught
the
molasses
is
overpowering
and
that
was
the
only
flavor
i
could
find
in
the
heavy
mouthfeel
naturally
when
someone
tries
a
beer
twice
one
hopes
to
be
more
impressed
overall
i
would
not
endorse
this
beer
to
someone
who
is
looking
for
complexity
o
a
winner
in
my
book
what
it
lacks
in
smoothness
it
makes
up
for
in
rich
flavor
that
brings
credit
to
the
entire
stout
style
if
they
ever
marketed
this
beer
with
the

it

what
im
getting
from
this
is
an
amplified
guinness
extra
stout
stronger
roasted
flavor
leaves
plenty
of
suds
down
the

the
smell
of
the
beer
seems
to
have
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
that
isnt
usually
common
from
guinness
the
other
aromas
consist
of
some
chocolate
and
some
really
burnt

the
taste
is
very
dry

from
the

2
oz
bottle
an
extremely
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
giant
thick
foamy
tan
head
that
conjures
up
images
of
a

at
the
carbonation
level
at
this
point
since
theres
no
seeing
through
the

aroma
is
of
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
black
coffee
but
its
surprisingly
and
somewhat
disappointingly
faint
1st
sip
brings
a
smooth
creamy
gift
of
the
aforementioned
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
dose
of
heavily
roasted
almost
burnt
malt
theres
also
a
hint
of
smokiness
with
a
heavy
dose
of
hops
bitterness
on
the
back
end
that
lingers
on
the
swallow
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
robust
without
being
overly
heavy
overall
a
beer
that
is
well
worthy
of
its
legendary
status
overall
quite
the
break
from
the
ordinary
certainly
the
beer
for
you
if
youre
looking
to
turbo
your
regular
guinness
experience
o
i
liked
this
one
ive
had
better
foreign
extras
but
this
one
was
worthy
and
id
have
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
taste
is
sweet

and
then
lingering
it
has
caramelized
coffee
and
burnt
fruits
rum
black

light
sour
fruit
element
but
it
is
mostly
sweet

then
bittersweet
its
excellent
and
very
drinkable
with
good
wellrounded
character
and
some
complexity
served
from

into
a
stone
nonic
poured
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
five
finger
very
fluffy
tan
head
that
subsided
to
two
fingers
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
caramel
apples
and
subtle
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wood
caramel
milk
chocolate
subtle
peat
and
very
very
slight
fruit
it
had
a
heavy
feel

this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
way
better
than
its
american
counterpart
really
surprised
at
this
one

really
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
try

just

the
one
we
usually
get
tastes
so
bad
as
this
one
is
a
completely
different
brew
in
my
opinion
will
be
buying
more
compared
to
the
usual
guinness
this
is
hands
down
the
superior
beer
o
flavorful
brew
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
sweetness
overall
nice
to
finally
have
this
and
good
to
see
it
available
here
in
the
us
beautiful
pour
with
enormous
dark
tan
head
and
black
body
that
looks
a
bit
brownish
when
held
to
lightsource
nose
is
very
enticing
with
some
caramel
coffee
grounds
and
black
forest
cake
palate
is
sweeter
than
expected
almost
roastyjammy
with
some
chocolate
in
the
mix
heavier
bodied
than
expected
too
though
still
fairly
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
really
pretty
good
much
better
than
the
draught
its
chocked
full
of
personality
lots
of
flavor
and
it
looks
nice
too
easily
drinkable
at
7
5
not
too
filling
in
my
opinion
solid
all
around
brew
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
any
guiness
is
a
must
for
good
ole
st
pattys
day
reading
and
research
has
unearthed
some
rather
interesting
details
about
this
brew
this
is
made
with
regards
to
an
old
recipe
that
guiness
used
for
their
export
beers
and
has
some
intentionally
skunked
brew
added
in
and
so
as
not
to
bore
you
with
details
the
pour
is
opaque
jet
black
joined
by
a
soapy
beige
head
that
dissapates
much
quicker
then
the
typical
nitroed
version
smell
is
oatey
malty
and
not
like
an
og
guiness
taste
is
obviously
similar
to
smell
but
with
higher
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
some
lingering
bitterness
for
7
5abv
it
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
and
is
no
where
near
as
creamy
as
the
guiness
everyone
knows
so
well
did
that
just
rhyme
which
brings
me
to
my
next
point
this
brew
will
undoubtedly
leave
you
feeling
full
and
fuzzy
buzzy
o
this
goes
down
easier
than
it
should
for
its
strength
it
is
so
flavorful
and
smooth
ill
be
back
for
more
opaque
in
color
topped
by
giant
cappuccino
head
that
clutches
the
edges
of
my
glass
aroma
of
cocoa
light
roast
light
cinnamon
cereal
cocoa
cinnamon
echo
of
the
booze
with
slight
prune
tang
but
not
too
much
roast
and
hops
make
an
invited
appearance
and
add
great
drynessbitterness
to
counter
that
famed
tang
heavy
body
with
light
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
the
best
guinness
ive
had
ready
for
day
or
night
drinking
o
would
have
another
only
drawback
is
that
its
sold
in
the
us
in
4
packs
of
11
2
oz
for
aroun
the
same
price
as
a
six
of
extra
in
any
event
this
is
a
helluva
complex
beer
and
one
i
recommend
seeking
out
i
would
absolutely
love
to
try
this
on
draught
someday
saw
this
at
my
local
distributor
last
week
for
the
first
time
had
to
double
check
to
make
sure
it
just
wasnt
a
repackaging
of
the
regular
export
stout
i
would
say
this
is
my
favorite
flavor
of
guinness
after
the
special
version
belgium
i
would
put
it
just
a
bit
ahead
of
the
250th
anniversary
version
we
got
a
few
years
back
nice
finnish
and
in
my
opinion
not
as
bitter
as
a
regular
guinness
very
good
smell
and
overall
feel
all
the
flavors
seemed
to
be
well
balanced
for
any
overall
enjoyable
experience
i
gotta
say
i
havent
cared
too
much
for
guinness
in
the
past
but
this
was
a
good
beer
o
overall
a
delicious
version
of
guinness
much
better
than
the
draught
if
i
am
going
to
go
with
guinness
this
is
the
only
version
i
will
buy
for
home
consumption
this
is
a
very
manly
a
tough
beer
a
good
food
companion
with
a
hearty
stew
d
oh
yeah
if
only
i
had
more
cash
layin
around
well
worth
a
try
or
a
sixer
to
savor
with
some
friends
o
this
is
what
i
wish
all
guinness
was
massively
more
flavor
and
overall
a
much
better
beer
m
very
grainy
texture
and
the
weight
is
a
just
bit
under
where
i
think
it
should
be
for
7
5
overall
this
is
what
i
fell
in
love
with
about
stouts
its
a
straight
shooter
and
will
give
you
exactly
what
you
expect
in
a
stout
and
then
some
dont
hesitate
going
out
and
expriencing
a
fine
stout
enjoy
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
decent
light
brown
head
obvious
stout
smell
here
as
well
as
roasted
malts
really
hits
the
taste
buds
with
a
great
mixture
of
bitterness
and
texture
has
a
slighty
salty
taste
that
is
blended
with
malts
and
other
bold
flavors
definetly
a
beer
to
enjoy
slowly
overall
not
bad
at
all
i
like
a
guinness
every
once
in
a
while
this
is
something
better
overall
a
decent
brew
from
a
big
name
i
would
probably
get
more
if
i
could
find
it
closer
to
home
overall
if
i
had
to
use
one
word
to
describe
this
beer
it
would
be
dry
the
combination
of
the
dryness
and
intense
flavors
makes
this
a
little
harder
to
drink
one
after
another
but
still
a
very
good
stout
d
very
high
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
id
gladly
have
another
one
and
i
predict
right
now
id
be
eager
for
a
3rd
after
that
overall
good
different
than
what
i
expected
and
im
not
sure
ill
be
in
a
rush
to
drink
the
other
3
bottles
i
have
especially
since
i
bought
4
packs
of
pranqster
and
old
rasputin
at
the
same
time
but
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
really
what
i
expectedwanted
overall
this
is
quite
a
tasty
beer
if
youre
into
stouts
it
packs
a
bigger
punch
than
its
cousin
but
is
very
drinkable
this
beer
is
something
that
i
could
drink
while
at
home
watching
movies
at
dinner
with
the
family
or
at
a
bar
with
some
good
buddies
cheer
to
that
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
by
guiness
to
apease
the
american
craft
brew
crowd
more
flavors
throughout
i
enjoyed
this
one
quite
alot
nice
job
overall
the
first
question
any
one
has
about
foreign
extra
is
how
is
this
different
from
a
regular
guinness
the
foreign
extra
backs
more
of
a
punch
and
tastes
more
like
a
normal
stout
it
has
a
great
aroma
and
packs
a
ton
of
flavor
it
is
also
more
complex
the
flavors
develop
and
change
as
the
beer
makes
its
way
down
the
throat
in
other
words
this
is
different
from
your
normal
guinness
and
it
is
worth
spending
the
extra
money
d
because
this
tastes
so
good
this
category
deserves
high
marks
equally
as
important
is
the
fact
that
this
beer
wont
fill
you
up
it
is
my
hope
that
the
availability
of
this
brew
persists
in
the
us
this
is
leaps
and
bounds
beyond
normal
guinness
draft
in
terms
of
flavor
yet
i
still
find
that
it
does
not
hold
up
to
many
of
the
fine
stouts
brewed
by
smaller
craft
operations
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
is
a
quality
stout
that
should
be
readily
available
but
i
am
not
sure
it
quite
lives
up
to
all
the
accolades
that
have
been
heaped
upon
this
beer
since
it
was
introduced
into
the
u
s
market
its
not
horrible
just
about
above
an
average
stout
the
taste
is
a
little
weird
for
me
at
first
but
as
it
warms
its
a
little
more
smooth
with
the
flavors
merging
quite
well
the
booziness
becomes
more
pronounce
but
blends
with
the
flavors
weird
but
not
boring
i
really
would
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
again
i
have
been
meaning
to
try
this
for
a
while
i
poured
a
couple
in
to
a
one
liter
boot
glass
color
is
very
dark
brown
with
some
ruby
hues
at
the
toe
and
heel
of
the
glass
about
two
fingers
of
tan
heading
spring
up
but
fade
away
quickly
in
to
a
lace
that
remains
till
the
end
a
big
creamy
nose
we
have
here
with
some
roasted
malt
sweet
cream
dark
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
the
taste
brings
me
back
to
my
first
guinness
back
in
high
school
with
lots
of
roasted
character
along
with
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
a
long
bready
finish
the
aftertaste
stays
with
you
for
a
while
making
you
want
to
continue
it
is
a
little
bitter
around
the
edges
yet
stays
smooth
if
that
makes
any
sense
the
body
feels
heavier
than
the
usual
extra
stout
or
draught
which
i
am
guessing
is
a
result
of
the
extra
addition
of
malt
and
hops
a
hint
of
alcohol
can
be
tasted
but
doesnt
become
overwhelming
at
all
like
i
said
before
this
reminds
me
of
my
first
encounters
with
guinness
which
really
was
the
first
dark
beer
i
had
ever
tasted
hopefully
this
version
will
find
a
home
in
a
lot
of
the
irish
pubs
where
the
two
others
are
regulars
cheers
the
stuff
in
the
states
may
be
fine
and
that
is
one
thing
but
to
say
foreign
extra
is
finally
available
in
na
is
another
because
the
na
stuff
is
not
the
foreign
extra
most
markets
get
thankfully
o
this
is
definitely
better
than
a
standard
guiness
not
an
incredible
beer
but
a
decent
stout
overall
highly
recommended
ive
was
quite
excited
to
try
this
beer
after
all
the
good
things
ive
been
told
about
it
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
definitely
doesnt
disappoint
the
pour
yielded
a
dark
black
beer
with
a
creamy
coffee
brown
head
i
got
an
aroma
of
roasted
coffee
tastewise
this
was
leaps
and
bounds
better
than
the
standard
guinness
a
swirl
of
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
full
bodied
quite
an
excellent
beer
i
also
had
one
in
st
kitts
where
they
make
it
in
2015
it
was
pretty
ok
too
d
far
more
satisfying
than
the
ordinary
black
stuff

disappointing
d
a
much
better
beer
than
regular
guinness
but
that
is
not
saying
much
i
like
this
beer
but
i
either
like
riss
more
or
this
is
lacking
something
much
more
drinkable
than
other
guinness
although
still
probably
just
a
slightly
above
average
stout
easy
drinking
to
the
point
of
it
being
unnoticeable
except
the
sourbitter
finish
not
anything
ill
be
looking
for
except
if
its
the
only
thing
available
on
st
patricks
day
i
would
definitely
drink
it
before
any
other
guinness
ive
had
sweet
banana
bitter
coffee
rum
burnt
sweetness
of
creme
brulee
in
the
back
finishes
dry
with
raisin
notes
and
slight
oaky
wine
taste
this
is
an
excellent
beer
full
of
flavor
and
none
of
them
are
artificial
a
long
time
coming
to
the
us
the
only
reason
to
drink
draught
guinness
now
is
the
lower
abv
if
youre
not
driving
stick
with
the
foreign
extra
stout
o
a
good
stout
this
is
different
than
guiness
draught
for
better
or
worse
if
i
could
change
anything
about
this
beer
i
would
dial
the
acidic
and
dry
aspect
down
as
far
as
stouts
go
this
finishes
a
little
funny
good
job
on
hiding
the
7
5
abv
though
wow
overall
its
the
best
product
guinness
makes
and
probably
the
best
fes
to
style
you
will
find
in
my
humble
opinion
i
hope
it
does
well
now
that
it
is
state
side
reason
being
given
guinness
distribution
and
macro
penetration
it
makes
a
good
go
to
craft
like
beer
in
otherwise
bmc
selling
establishments
overall
this
is
the
best
guinness
that
i
have
had
to
date
the
flavors
are
fantastic
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
if
you
dont
like
guinness
because
of
its
mass
production
flat
finish
and
blah
taste
you
should
really
give
the
foreign
extra
a
try
its
more
of
a
beer
advocates
guinness
much
tastier
fizzier
and
stronger
o
i
have
only
have
guinness
draught
twice
in
my
life
both
times
on
tap
and
i
have
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
is
but
it
never
stood
out
to
me
too
much
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
though
very
drinkable
considering
the
abv
and
with
enough
depth
and
complexity
for
me
to
want
to
revisit
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
pours
a
thin
blackish
body
with
great
tan
head
and
lace
patches
everywhere
down
glass
on
top
of
a
sticky
syrupy
malty
aroma
that
has
minor
sweetness
and
a
boozy
grainy
hop
undertone
what
can
i
say
of
flavorbody
that
isnt
known
smooth
creamy
goes
down
easy
a
lighterbodied
stout
that
has
a
delicate
balance
of
a
grainy
hoppy
frontbite
and
then
passes
clean
and
mellow
with
a
strong
malt
base
roasted
dry
malts
mix
with
sweet
malts
like
caramel
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
so
in
other
words
after
the
hoppy
prickly
taste
that
first
hits
your
tongue
you
get
that
sturdy
drysweet
malt
profile
one
loves
from
a
stout
and
then
finishes
with
a
crisp
finish
while
not
the
strongest
stout
it
is
wellcrafter
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
real
deal
d
gets
better
as
it
warms
while
the
chocolate
comes
out
more
next
time
i
pick
this
up
ill
just
wait
till
it
gets
to
that
point
had
heard
great
things
and
was
not
disappointed
full
flavored
full
bodied
lots
of
roast
overall
a
very
good
offering
and
i
really
like
this
one
better
than
the
regular
guinness
really
nicely
done
overall
this
is
super
the
head
even
though
it
is
not
nitrogenous
is
very
similar
to
the
draught
in
that
way
lovely
and
glad
its
in
the
states
o
wow
impressed
i
always
liked
draught
as
it
was
my
gateway
beer
to
craftimport
but
this
is
likely
to
have
me
spending
my
guinness
dollars
here
instead
glad
we
got
this
after
90
years
of
absence
i
took
a
smell
and
it
hit
me
with
the
roasted
malts
and
grains
a
bit
of
something
sweet
that
first
sip
was
a
little
creamy
but
a
bit
thinner
than
your
irish
stouts
the
taste
was
obviously
a
blast
of
roasted
malts
grains
and
some
burnt
chocolate
there
was
also
a
good
balance
of
alcohol
i
could
barely
notice
it
in
the
taste
the
usual
guinness
has
4
5
where
as
this
is
around
7
5
and
after
a
few
you
will
actually
feel
the
difference
this
drinks
much
better
than
a
thicker
stout
leaving
you
not
full
after
a
few
and
leaving
you
with
a
little
of
a
buzz
wow
this
is
one
hell
of
a
stout
highly
complex
and
delicious
a
must
try
o
this
fucking
beer
is
delicious
i
am
a
guinness
fan
and
this
blows
anything
else
they
make
out
of
the
water
this
is
a
very
very
good
stout
d
i
wanna
swim
in
a
pool
of
it
delectable
drink
up
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
much
different
tasting
guinness
that
everyone
knows
d
really
glad
to
have
found
this
and
got
to
try
it
a
pretty
good
effort
and
better
than
i
feared
once
upon
a
time
i
thought
guinness
was
the
shit
when
it
came
to
beer
those
days
have
been
gone
awhile
but
this
is
good
enough
to
at
least
remind
me
of
how
i
used
to
look
at
the
products
that
purport
to
be
from
st
james
gate
if
the
calculator
punchers
at
diageo
were
to
choose
to
make
this
a
regular
offering
i
would
drink
it
on
occaision
out
of
a
330cl
bottle
and
into
my
shaker
pint
glass
picked
up
at
abes
for
2
and
change
the
stout
appears
a
deep
nearly
black
color
with
a
good
two
fingers
of
thick
bubbly
light
tan
foam
ample
lacing
lasting
head
nose
and
flavors
nice
and
roasty
as
expected
bitter
espresso
beans
dark
chocolate
brown
bread
licorice
burnt
caramel
and
black
cherries
attack
the
senses
approaching
full
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
and
a
lingering
bitter
finish
shocker
very
tasty
stuff
glad
to
see
this
easily
available
here
without
trading
for
it
like
in
the
past
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
ive
never
had
it
before
and
i
will
definitely
search
it
out
again
super
smooth
overall
my
favorite
guinness
type
ive
had
yet
i
love
the
in
your
face
roastiness
and
full
body
normally
i
would
take
off
of
the
mustiness
but
i
think
it
adds
complexity
and
character
to
this
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
an
almost
jetblack
coloring
but
with
some
ruby
highlights
the
head
is
a
big
chunky
light
milkchocolate
coloring
that
settles
into
a
one
inch
vision
after
the
beautiful
cascade
chocolate
coffee
toffee
and
molasses
invade
the
nasal
cavity
on
first
smells
and
further
investigation
gives
off
a
slightly
bitter
and
slightly
sour
scent
the
beer
is
subtle
in
its
initial
flavors
and
it
slowly
reveals
some
smokey
roast
flavors
darkly
sweet
caramel
and
molasses
malt
and
a
very
sneaky
hoppiness
in
the
very
deep
background
there
is
also
a
roasted
meat
quality
to
the
flavor
as
well
although
i
have
a
hard
time
pinpointing
it
to
anything
more
than
that
the
beer
is
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
and
the
flavors
quickly
depart
the
mouth
leaving
a
slightly
sweet
and
rich
aftertaste
delicious
also
this
is
my
first
review
with
the
overall
category
so
i
slightly
changed
my
format
combining
my
drinkability
and
overall
parts
d
im
a
huge
sucker
for
rauchbiers
so
this
stout
is
right
up
my
alley
anytime
you
can
take
the
roast
into
smoke
territory
it
makes
a
great
beer
fact
after
tasting
the
same
beer
60
minutes
in
the
cooler
longer
than
the
first
one
my
immediate
take
was
that
the
carbonation
appeared
to
be
higher
overall
i
felt
this
was
a
lighter
version
of
guinness
but
i
still
like
the
guinness
draught
better
o
overall
great
beer
probably
one
of
there
best
i
got
a
four
pack
for
st
pattys
wish
i
got
some
more
cheers
this
is
the
guinness
that
you
dream
of
a
full
and
robust
stout
complex
and
extremely
tasty
this
is
a
super
beer
and
i
will
be
buying
more
too
bad
its
so
high
in
abv
will
be
buying
more

sure

extra
stout
was
black
in

with
a

when
held
to
a
light
it
had
a
large
light
tan
head
with
good
retention
and

the
smell
was

the
taste
was
mainly
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
and
bakers

the

was
dry
with
lingering
roasted

and
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
was
good
with

and
medium

somewhat
creamy
the

was
very

this
is
a
good
stout
and
much
better
the
regular
extra
stout
d
i
like
stouts
and
i
like
this
beer
very
drinkable
but
a
filling
stout
i
am
glad
to
finally
see
this
brew
available
in
local
stores
it
exits
the
bottle
black
a
fast
pour
produced
a
towering
cap
of
tan
foam
the
foam
left
circles
of
lacing
down
the
glass
indicating
the
volume
of
each
quaff
the
aroma
is
darkly
roasted
malt
sweet
vinous
fruit
and
bitter
hops
the
flavors
present
more
dark
roasted
malt
with
bitter
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
earth
fruit
the
alcohol
gives
the
brew
some
body
through
the
center
it
finishes
with
a
sparse
smattering
of
bitter
hops
the
palate
is
left
with
a
powder
residue
that
traps
the
flavors
near
the
taste
budsdefinitely
a
good
thing
this
is
a
delicately
balanced
beer
which
satisfies
you
need
to
have
this
st
patricks
day
incredibly
good
showing
for
guinness
i
really
enjoy
this
stout
this
beer
pours
a
thick
black
with
a
finger
of
thick
tan
head
with
little
to
no
lacing
as
you
drink
the
aroma
is
strong
with
sour
notes
as
well
as
some
roasted
barley
the
taste
starts
sour
and
then
moves
to
coffee
and
chocolate
and
finishes
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
for
my
liking
and
the
taste
lingers
with
you
for
some
time
i
would
say
worth
a
try
if
you
are
a
fan
of
sour
stouts
drinkability
fairly
balanced
but
maybe
fust
one
or
two
would
do
depending
on
the
mood
obviously
there
arent
many
stouts
that
one
will
sit
down
and
willingly
pound
6
of
in
a
session
however
for
the
style
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
down
if
you
like
guinness
but
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
depth
then
give
this
a
try
slainte
pours
a
beautiful
dark
black
but
when
held
to
light
revealed
a
ruby
red
character
smell
was
subdued
but
nonetheless
presented
a
nice
roasty
character
as
well
as
some
chocolate
taste
was
where
this
shined
roasty
and
delicious
all
around
nice
dark
chocolate
and
almost
milk
like
quality
full
mouthfeel
and
was
incredibly
drinkable
i
could
put
down
these
without
blinking
an
eye
although
they
do
creep
up
on
you
after
a
few
d
guinness
this
might
be
the
most
impressive

relatively

a

round
out
the

character

im

the

remains

exact

the
taste
closely

offers

ask

two

of

this
varies
from
the

this
beer
pours
black
as
a
guinness

with

the
aroma
is
lovely
nice
warm
roasted

with
the
alcohol
barely
detectable
the
taste
brings
the
roasted
barley
in
quantity
with
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
backed
by
the
warm

something
almost
fruity
the

23

not
having
the

or
on
a

this
does
not
cascade
like
a

guinness
would
the
head
slowly
settles
to
form
a

laces

it

the

has

perhaps
too
much
so
considering
the
abv
not
something
im
likely
to
buy
apart
from
at

nothing
i
would

to
recommend
to
people
either

i
had
to
try
this
but
wont
be
buying
it
again
im
sure
many
bas
will
love
it
but
its
just
not
for
me
d
this
is
what
guinness
felt
and
tasted
like
the
first
time
i
had
it
on
tap
in
the
uk
but
slightly
thicker
outstanding
stout
and
sad
that
i
didnt
buy
more
d
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
stout
from
guinness
but
a
bit
inconsistent
if
there
aroma
was
more
prominent
and
if
it
had
a
little
more
thickness
this
would
be
outstanding
that
said
still
very
drinkable
d
i
love
all
nondraught
forms
of
guinness
i
am
a
very
bad
judge
of
this
i
would
drink
guinness
all
day
every
day
if
i
had
the
choice
that
said
fes
is
extremely
drinkable
d
excellent
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
certainly
try
it
again
i
grew
up
on
guinness
but
dont
drink
a
lot
of
it
anymore
as
i
find
the
standard
draught
just
soso
and
the
extra
only
slightly
better
the
fes
is
definitely
going
to
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
again
d
sipper
tasty
but
not
remarkable
there
are
many
imperial
stouts
id
rather
have
crazy
drinkability
this
seems
sessionable
not
sure
i
would
have
the
guts
to
try
pretty
much
as
good
as
i
remember
if
being
back
in
the
day
i
havent
had
a
foreignexport
stout
before
but
this
would
fall
short
for
a
ris
or
even
a
stronger
regular
american
stout
notes
this
irish
brew
is
a
full
bodied
treat
yet
at
the
same
time
very
sessional
its
abv
is
hardly
noticeable
a
solid
brew
by
any
means
and
one
that
i
plan
to
have
on
hand
come
next
st
patricks
day
dr
i
think
two
would
be
max
for
me
d
i
wish
everyone
would
switch
out
their
guinness
lines
for
this
give
people
a
taste
for
a
real
stout
great
flavor
but
the
dryness
might
hold
it
back
as
it
wears
on
the
palate
drinkability
cheers
to
guinness
for
this
one
its
super
solid
with
great
flavors
and
a
near
perfect
mouthfeel
weight
might
slow
me
down
after
one
or
two
and
the
abv
would
likely
catch
up
at
7
5
after
a
couple
as
well
but
nice
for
a
cold
night
and
im
more
than
cool
feeling
that
i
could
drink
2
maybe
even
three

bucksbottle
doveraall
a
very
delicious
brew
with
a

complexity

flavors
that
compliment
rather
than
overdue
each
other
i
like
this
it
is
an
instant
friend
sure
beer
geeks
have
been
ready
for
this
to
arrive
stateside
for
20
years
but
i
guess
diageo
had
to
wait
until
there
was
enough
frat
boy
irish
pub
hype
to
ensure
a
sufficient
market
which
isnt
wrong
for
a
large
concern
so
great
its
here
so
lets
do
it
drinkability
is
pretty
smooth
some
light
lingering
sweetness
and
stickyness
a
bit
of
booze
and
fair
amount
of
bitterness
this
is
unquestionably
the
best
thing
guinness
has
going
for
it
its
rich
and
complex
not
watery
like
their
flagship
brew
i
think
the
best
quality
is
the
fact
they
didnt
muck
things
up
with
that
nitro
widget
i
am
glad
this
brew
is
available
here
in
the
states
it
blows
the
doors
off
their
other
offerings
heres
hoping
guinnessdiagio
start
to
focus
on
brews
like
this
overall
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
beer
there
is
way
to
much
roasted
malt
flavor
for
my
liking
d
overall
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
a
must
try
i
would
drink
this
all
day
if
i
could
at
7
5
abv
with
a
pronounced
flavor
this
one
is
just
verging
on
a
sipping
stout
but
it
still
retains
some
drinkability
one
cant
help
but
wonder
if
guinness
extra
stout
and
foreign
extra
can
survive
on
the
same
shelves
together
i
havent
done
a
thorough
sidebyside
yet
but
there
would
seem
to
be
only
the
slightest
of
differences
between
the
two
the
most
prominent
being
more
of
that
lactic
sourness
and
the
bigger
warming
from
alcohol
for
all
its
full
wellexecuted
flavors
this
guinness
remains
really
easydrinking
abv
is
completely
masked
glad
this
one
is
now
more
widely
availablei
like
it
exponentially
more
than
the
other
guinness
beers
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
a
slight
warming
alcohol
touch
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
could
sip
a
few
of
these
despite
the
7

just
expected
to
be
more
blown
away
by
the
taste

the
tasting
nose
reveals
a
trace
of
roast
and
sour
lactic
acid
taste
expresses
char
up
front
more
sour
watery
lactic
acid
a
slightly
metallic
quality
and
a
bitter
acrid
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
consistency
with
a
lively
slightly
prickly
carbonation
and
a
subtle
creaminess
well
i
have
to
say
that
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
bear
im
a
bit
more
used
to
some
sweetness
and
a
suggestion
of
fruit
in
my
foreignexport
stouts
this
was
bitter
burnt
and
acrid
not
something
i
need
to
experience
again
any
time
soon
d
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
not
to
be
confused
with
its
cousin
guinness
extra
draft
my
only
regret
is
that
it
has
taken
so
long
to
come
back
to
america
overall
just
released
in
the
u
s
for
the
first
time
in
90
years
definitely
make
this
your
next
beer
no
question
that
it
is
the
best
guinness
out
there
i
give
two
enthusiastic
schlitz
for
this
beer
its
delicious
and
i
can
only
hope
that
it
eventually
makes
its
way
to
my
little
town
d
well
it
may
not
be
the
first
thing
on
my
mind
but
i
could
see
getting
another
four
pack
the
problem
is
that
10
50
for
a
four
pack
for
this
is
pricey
and
not
the
first
beer
that
would
come
to
mind
for
the
price
overall
if
you
got
the
money
and
you
can
find
it
pick
up
a
four
pack
you
will
not
be
disappointed
drinkability
yeah
ones
enough
after
ninety
plus
years
away
from
america
i
some
how
expected
this
to
have
more
of
a
wow
factor
but
was
disappointed
still
drinkable
and
one
ill
revisit
d
can
drink
this
any
time
of
day
and
would
be
able
to
drink
many
of
these
before
losing
it
would
highly
recommend
to
many
others
d
this
is
an
excellent
beer
worth
checking
out
for
sure
the
draught
guinness
i
hate
and
extra
stout
i
liked
but
prolly
wouldnt
buy
again
but
this
is
worth
a
repeat
purchase
try
this
one
at
least
d
excellent
flavor
nicely
balanced
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
but
then
the
7
5
abv
would
destroy
me
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
if
that
is
even
possible
overall
it
really
strikes
me
as
a
more
guiness
guiness
almost
like
the
regular
is
guinesslite
drinkability
a
great
beer
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
better
than
some
of
the
the
other
guinness
beers
i
have
had
but
nothing
special
it
is
certainly
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
just
a
slightly
above
average
stout
here
overall
a
much
more
enjoyable
stout
than
the
draft
i
remember
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
soon
its
richer
than
the
original
but
it
hides
the
alcohol
warmth
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
stout
i
love
the
original
guinness
this
one
is
also
good
not
better
or
worse
just
different
yet
the
same
definitely
good
finish
a
four
pack
of
this
easily
t
best
ive
had
from
st
james
gate
the
bottle
i
purchased
did
not
have
the
nitrogen
widget
in
it
which
made
me
glad
the
natural
carbonation
really
brought
out
the
flavors
for
nearly
8
abv
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
however
i
thought
the
body
could
use
a
little
bit
more
chewyness
and
perhaps
add
a
little
more
bitterness
to
the
flavor
otherwise
this
is
a
terrific
brew
i
hope
to
always
have
a
few
bottles
in
the
fridge
for
when
i
desire
a
stout
dark
black
color
with
a
large
rising
head
that
had
excellant
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
lacing
coats
the
entire
glass
surface
all
the
way
down
to
the
last
sip
rich
aroma
of
dark
malt
chocolate
malt
and
a
little
roasted
malt
malt
lovers
will
love
the
aroma
of
this
beer
the
flavor
was
a
little
sweeter
than
what
i
expected
flavor
is
more
from
the
unroasted
malt
than
the
bitter
roasted
malt
quite
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
can
be
tasted
alcohol
is
strong
in
the
finish
and
that
lowers
my
score
a
little
solid
full
body
with
good
carbonation
so
this
is
the
beer
they
drink
in
the
tropics
would
not
be
my
first
choice
but
more
like
i
want
on
this
cold
winter
day
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
the
typical
black
malt
bitterness
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
sweetness
its
like
a
normal
guinness
on
steroids
its
dry
and
roasted
and
smooth
as
hell
the
taste
is
great
as
well
its
bitter
up
front
with
loads
of
patent
malts
its
goes
down
smooth
and
dry
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
malt
sweetness
i
love
the
black
malt
component
its
richer
than
the
original
but
it
hides
the
alcohol
warmth
well
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
stout
i
love
the
original
guinness
but
this
one
is
better
overall
a
great
beer
about
time
its
available
in
the
us
a
perfect
thanksgiving
eve
beer
with
a
foot
of
snow
on
the
ground
and
another
storm
coming
a
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
a
warm
fireplace
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
very
bitter
its
a
little
sweet
up
front
but
very
very
bitter
it
finishes
very
dry
its
good
but
ive
had
better
guinnesses
guinnessi
i
was
waiting
for
years
to
try
the
fabled
foreign
extra
stout
and
while
there
was
probably
no
beer
that
could
live
up
to
the
mounting
expectations
i
am
very
pleased
overall
with
this
offering
from
guinness
im
still
not
sure
whether
i
like
this
or
extra
stout
better
though
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
on
tap
somewhere
because
the
carbonation
slightly
prohibits
the
creaminess
that
is
often
experienced
with
the
nitro
tap
poured
from
the
bottle
a
dark
blackish
brown
with
ruby
red
highlights
when
held
to
thelight
with
a
thick
rockycreamy
tan
head
that
settled
to
a
nice
tan
ribbon
that
lasted
for
the
beer
and
left
lacings
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
with
a
slight
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
and
bitter
hops
taste
is
domnated
by
bitter
roast
malt
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffe
and
the
hops
work
right
along
with
the
bitterness
of
the
grains
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
and
creamy
a
lot
of
folks
commment
about
it
being
heavy
but
this
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
wonderful
smoothness
about
it
drinkability
is
excellent
the
balanced
carbonation
and
moderat
alchohol
level
make
this
a
wonderful
stout
cheers
im
also
curious
about
the
marketing
for
it
it
looks
really
similar
to
the
other
varieties
and
i
can
imagine
that
potentially
causing
some
confusion
this
is
an
enjoyable
and
very
unique
brew
and
im
glad
ive
finally
had
the
opportunity
to
try
it
you
have
to
be
in
a
certain
mood
to
drink
this
and
its
a
very
different
mood
than
drinking
bottled
guinness
with
widgets
or
on
tap
whereas
i
could
drink
3
pints
of
the
stuff
on
tap
no
problem
one
of
these
is
plenty
as
its
so
rich
and
burnt
i
would
buy
it
again
light
and
smooth
a
bit
rich
a
decent
beer
i
was
expecting
more
from
the
other
reviews
the
flavors
were
done
well
but
not
exceptionally
well
i
prefer
lion
stout
to
this
guy
any
day
from
11
2
fl
oz

it
pours
out
to
a
dark
brownblack
opaque
tone
with
about
an
inch
of
foamy
brown
head
that
lingers
and
laces
the
aroma
has
a
sort
of
burnt
malt
and
butterscotch
feel
to
it
with
a
touch
of
bitter
hops
behind
medium
body
the
taste
is
clean
enough
with
a
good
solid
bitterness
and
a
malty
characteristic
that
kind
of
reminds
me
of
a
mallo
bar
compared
to
the
guinness
regular
extra
stout
the
alcohol
is
more
notable
but
compared
to
other
stouts
it
is
not
i
am
not
enamoured
by
it
but
found
it
to
be
fairly
drinkable
d
quite
nice
the
bitter
flavour
is
quite
nice
but
i
believe
it
could
be
better
the
coffee
flavour
blends
into
the
bitterness
but
i
think
it
could
blend
smoother
some
sips
it
seemed
quite
harsh
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
better
than
i
expected
but
still
seemed
just
slightly
thinner
than
desired
in
the
mouth
but
this
thinness
makes
me
want
to
drink
another
foreign
extra
after
this
one
is
done
this
is
the
guinness
my
grandfather
enjoyed
as
a
young
one
i
imagine
d
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
if
youre
a
fan
of
guinness
you
should
definitely
try
this
overall
a
very
pleasant
surprise
definitely
not
the
easygoing
guinness
which
i
enjoy
well
enough
this
one
is
one
i
will
actively
seek
out
againsoon
a
beer
that
does
the
guinness
legacy
proud
now
why
cant
they
produce
a
dry
stout
that
does
the
same
they
were
pretty
close
with
the
guinness
250
but
it
shouldnt
take
an
historic
anniversary
to
goad
them
into
doing
it
fairly
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
after
the
other
good
to
start
or
end
the
evening
but
not
sessionable
glad
i
found
this
reminds
me
of
a
russian
imperial
stout
more
than
the
mothers
milk
of
regular
guinness
hops
it
you
first
with
a
bitter
bite
but
the
malt
keeps
it
from
overwhelming
the
balance
the
alcohol
is
very
present
in
the
mouthfeel
and
burns
a
bit
on
the
back
of
the
throat
7
5
percent
nice
thats
where
the
ris
confusion
comes
in
great
beer
pours
a
fantastic
deep
black
color
with
great
head
and
wonderful
lacing
it
has
a
huge
deep
aroma
with
great
malty
sweetness
underneath
a
great
roasted
grain
and
coffee
aroma
wonderful
taste
a
wonderful
thick
dry
stout
with
coffee
tones
and
a
slight
hint
of
chocolate
with
a
nice
light
hop
after
tone
on
the
tongue
it
goes
down
wonderfully
smooth
with
just
the
slightest
roughness
from
the
higher
abv
this
is
a
wonderful
stout
perfection
drinkability
now
this
is
a
guinness
best
foreignexport
stout
i
have
had
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
creamy
with
a
dry
finish
i
really
like
this
version
of
guinness
and
am
glad
it
is
available
serving
type
bottle
obviously
nothing
like
the
standard
guinness
this
one
is
really
well
done
even
if
i
did
have
to
drop
5
on
11
2oz
i
end
with
one
thing
i
am
now
glad
its
in
the
us
market
a
nice
beer
overall
and
quite
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
definitely
lived
up
to
the
hype
that
i
read
about
it
i
poured
into
a
snifter
to
three
inches
of
brown
head
it
is
black
is
color
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
some
dark
fruit
and
bready
undertones
the
taste
begins
with
dark
fruits
followed
by
roasted
malt
and
finishing
with
some
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
creamy
of
the
nitrous
cans
but
its
not
bad
i
still
think
extra
stout
is
the
best
of
the
family
11
2oz
bottle
best
before
date
of
l0244gf0001
unsure
of
what
that
means
pours
an
almost
black
with
very
minimal
head
aromas
of
roasted
malts
and
some
coffee
flavors
of
some
more
coffee
and
chocolate
but
also
some
molasses
aftertaste
of
roasted
malts
pretty
smooth
stout
nothing
revolutionary
but
nothing
bad
either
i
liked
it
and
id
look
for
it
in
a
bar
but
probably
wont
rush
out
to
buy
another
4
pack
for
10
drinkability
very
good
i
find
it
to
be
a
nice
balanced
beer
not
too
heavy
and
though
the
alcohol
content
isnt
super
high
the
flavors
still
mask
it
well
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
overall
a
very
original
and
tasty
stout
it
is
sweet
spicy
and
smooth
and
leaves
the
draught
in
the
dust
shame
on
you
diageo
for
having
the
ability
to
make
awesome
beer
and
still
producing
mediocre
brews
its
certainly
how
i
described
it
regular
guinness
amped
up
but
its
left
me
wanting
more
perhaps
it
just
needs
to
warm
up
a
bit
regardless
i
would
still
recommend
it
d
a
wonderful
stout
that
hits
a
nice
medium
between
standard
stouts
and
an
ris
in
my
opinion
guinness
best
beer
by
far
im
so
glad
theyve
started
bringing
this
stateside
d
this
didnt
really
taste
all
that
different
from
a
normal
guinness
extra
stout
to
me
but
its
still
a
solid
example
of
the
style
d
the
best
guinness
ive
ever
had
a
good
beer
that
ive
waited
quite
awhile
to
try
im
glad
this
is
finally
available
in
the
us
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
a
smoother
slightly
more
complex
version
of
the
typical
guinness
draught
and
it
shows
in
the
feel
and
the
flavors
theres
a
bit
more
alcohol
to
take
into
account
but
it
still
goes
down
well
and
drinks
like
a
champ
ill
probably
pick
up
another
bottle
and
see
how
it
does
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
to
mellow
out
the
taste
dwell
it
gets
more
bitter
as
the
drink
goes
on
i
find
this
undesirable
the
abv
hits
quickly
its
great
tasting
but
its
for
some
reason
its
a
difficult
beer
to
finish
o
so
much
promise
with
a
great
appearance
and
appealing
aroma
ill
try
this
one
again
to
double
check
the
flavor
could
have
been
so
much
more
nearly
flawless
pour
coal
black
a
voluminous
mochashaded
head
lasting
creamy
dimpled
that
leaves
handsome
drapes
of
lacing
as
much
as
one
associates
a
thick
creamy
dense
head
with
guinness
draught
this
may
be
why
i
hesitate
to
give
perfect
marks
to
the
look
but
its
damn
close
moving
on
the
aroma
is
surprisingly
not
as
rich
the
flavor
just
lightly
bitterroasty
and
sweet
yet
naturally
appealing
my
oh
my
does
this
taste
and
drink
wonderfully
the
bitterness
kicks
up
a
couple
notches
though
never
coming
off
biting
or
feeling
astringent
there
is
a
light
smooth
acidity
that
lingers
from
a
moderatestrength
roasty
foundation
but
just
a
soft
touch
instead
of
chocolate
flavors
which
i
was
half
expecting
i
found
subtle
vanilla
notes
starting
in
the
tail
of
the
middle
through
the
finish
delightful
add
to
all
of
this
some
molasses
flavors
and
light
viscosity
and
an
almost
perfect
midrange
degree
of
body
and
this
is
a
thoroughly
wellbalanced
highly
enjoyable
export
stout
and
one
of
the
best
nofrills
stronger
stouts
ive
had
says
a
lot
again
worth
it
drinkability
it
is
no
light
weight
when
it
comes
to
the
abv
but
im
finding
the
alcohol
is
hidden
very
well
much
more
so
than
the
super
delicious
belgianjohn
martin
version
that
is
only
a
half
a
percent
more
not
a
session
brew
for
sure
but
ive
finished
my
first
bottle
and
1
more
will
finish
a
very
good
sitting
with
a
very
good
foreign
extra
stout
now
when
is
guinness
going
to
give
us
a
russian
imperial
taste
not
as
good
as
the
smell
smokey
and
rich
roasty
sweet
really
unlike
any
other
stout
ive
had
before
d
just
builds
off
of
a
regular
american
guinness
and
turns
it
into
something
that
much
better
ive
been
jealous
about
practicly
everywhere
else
in
the
world
getting
this
except
the
us
but
nowi
can
drink
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
the
drink
on
this
one
is
great
its
got
a
great
balance
is
extremely
smooth
a
very
nice
viscous
stout
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
probably
the
best
pints
of
guinness
i
have
ever
had
this
is
not
a
heavy
as
traditional
guinness
so
i
would
have
to
say
i
could
probably
drink
these
all
night
abv
is
a
little
high
so
some
people
might
not
be
able
to
do
more
then
2
otherwise
an
amazing
stout
offered
for
free
but
probably
save
my
money
for
something
a
little
better
ive
been
itching
to
try
one
of
these
ever
since
i
heard
they
were
coming
to
america
though
eddie
murphy
will
not
be
involved
in
this
experience
i
still
am
able
to
gaze
upon
a
super
dark
brown
this
beer
isnt
able
to
be
penetrated
by
light
and
has
a
nice
thick
tan
foam
that
you
can
easily
sit
a
bottle
cap
on
i
actually
try
it
from
time
to
time
this
one
floated
longer
than
most
the
smell
is
mainly
of
coffee
and
roasted
dark
chocolate
there
seems
to
be
a
decent
light
hop
aroma
making
its
way
through
to
the
nose
accompanied
by
some
molasses
for
sweetness
there
is
a
lot
of
burnt
taste
in
this
beer
i
know
its
too
the
style
but
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
i
honestly
didnt
think
that
i
would
be
able
to
taste
the
distinctive
guinness
sour
flavor
but
there
it
is
waiting
for
me
in
the
aftertaste
i
didnt
really
expect
to
taste
the
liquor
in
this
beer
but
it
makes
itself
known
as
well
with
all
those
notes
it
still
remains
predominantly
a
roasted
dark
chocolate
flavor
adding
some
burnt
biscuit
taste
as
well
the
liqour
roast
combo
just
doesnt
seem
to
work
right
and
i
dont
know
why
its
very
velvety
on
the
tongue
but
the
bitterness
mixed
with
the
astringency
of
the
beer
removes
it
from
the
perfect
pantheon
i
would
have
hoped
for
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
i
would
have
it
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
deep
roast
overall
this
is
a
true
guinness
and
a
good
traditional
stout
not
quite
complex
and
sweet
enough
to
put
it
in
the
exceptional
range
but
great
for
what
it
is
for
the
price
though
i
think
ill
be
sticking
to
victorys
storm
king
stout
for
the
most
part
d
high
for
a
stout
although
i
wouldnt
pick
up
another
4pack
poured
into
a
snifter
the
color
is
dark
brownblack
and
a
decent
sized
head
strong
lacing
throughout
smell
is
of
sweet
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
tastes
like
the
guinness
draught
only
with
a
strong
hint
of
chocolate
and
bigger
roasted
malt
profile
much
drier
than
the
sweet
smell
would
imply
also
tastes
a
little
like
generic
grain
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
creamy
feel
that
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
and
with
little
mouthcoating
and
aftertaste
drinkability
is
fairly
decent
its
priced
a
little
higher
than
it
should
be
at
11
a
4pack
of
11
2
oz
bottles
decent
beer
but
at
its
price
point
i
wouldnt
get
again
unless
craft
options
are
limited
or
the
price
comes
down
this
has
been
a
long
time
coming
i
like
if
you
strip
all
of
what
makes
this
interesting
then
you
would
have
the
generic
thin
shit
they
sell
in
the
us
wow
they
should
just
scrap
the
crappy
guinness
thats
sold
in
the
us
now
and
replace
it
with
this
overall
a
fantastic
stout
that
im
glad
i
tried
with
the
fantastic
selection
of
local
regional
big
stouts
out
there
i
doubt
ill
be
rushing
out
to
buy
a
4pack
of
this
soon
but
you
never
know
the
looks
on
this
baby
are
absolutely
picturesque
the
acridsmokeybitter
characteristics
are
stellar
this
beer
is
black
with
brown
edging
it
had
a
rocky
mocha
color
head
that
didnt
stay
very
long
slightly
hoppy
aroma
noted
also
roast
coffee
it
had
a
distinct
sour
tinge
to
the
nose
forward
roasted
malt
on
the
tongue
initially
semi
smoky
oats
it
has
a
very
tart
sour
taste
that
i
am
not
used
to
expecting
from
a
guinness
medium
body
and
carbonated
the
tartness
throws
it
off
a
bit
i
still
prefer
the
original
guinness
in
a
can
with
the
widget
seems
to
have
less
sweetness
than
most
of
the
export
stouts
i
have
had
a
twinge
of
sourness
and
a
dry
roasty
malt
character
fit
into
the
guinness
portfolio
well
i
really
think
i
like
the
extra
stout
better
than
this
one
even
though
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
and
the
fruitiness
comes
and
goes
in
flashes
of
course
it
is
better
than
the
draught
but
i
cant
help
but
think
this
is
not
the
same
beer
that
is
offered
in
africa
and
ireland
mfd
full
bodied
and
sticky
went
down
well
even
at
7
5abv
perfect
choice
for
the
colder
weather
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
on
draft
and
with
a
good
cigar
good
foreign
stout
the
novelty
and
long
wait
alone
were
worth
paying
the
9
99
for
the
4pack
but
a
second
purchase
at
that
price
i
wont
know
until
the
next
time
i
enter
a
store
d
loved
it
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
draft
d
this
beer
is
ok
but
i
expected
a
little
more
than
what
i
tasted
guinness
really
isnt
my
thing
and
this
one
just
proves
it
more
and
more
i
didnt
mind
it
but
its
not
the
thing
i
expected
it
with
all
the
hype
from
it
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
but
nothing
spectacular
overall
an
enjoyable
stout
certainly
better
than
the
original
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
cheaper
american
stoutsporters
that
i
would
rather
have
d
id
prefer
to
have
this
over
the
regular
guinness
but
its
not
available
in
the
states
alas
t
malts
along
with
a
much
bolder
taste
than
the
draught
after
2
beers
im
getting
more
and
more
attached
to
the
taste
overall
this
is
wonderful
and
by
far
my
favorite
guinness
guinness
draught
is
bad
guinness
extra
stout
is
good
but
this
is
fantastic
an
excellent
stout
and
one
that
is
unique
in
its
excellent
dry
bitterness
wellbalanced
and
delicious
d
a
nice
brew
i
can
see
why
it
got
quite
a
bit
of
attention
prior
to
arriving
in
the
us
cant
say
its
a
great
stout
but
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
near
black
color
with
brown
edges
couple
finger
khaki
colored
head
not
super
tight
that
left
some
nice
webby
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
bit
grainy
and
has
some
metallic
notes
along
with
a
light
roasted
malt
and
licorice
presence
perhaps
a
slight
touch
of
butter
the
taste
has
a
good
roasted
malt
flavor
some
charred
wood
and
licorice
there
is
a
noticable
grassy
bitterness
as
well
some
rust
like
flavors
as
well
the
feel
is
moderate
with
prickly
carbonation
fairly
crisp
as
in
it
doesnt
linger
on
your
palate
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
roasty
bitterness
indeed
a
tasty
guinness
stout
with
the
roasted
malt
really
coming
through
it
drinks
fairly
easy
and
the
7
5abv
is
well
hidden
d
this
is
one
of
the
few
massproduced
brews
that
is
truly
worldclass
now
that
it
is
on
shelves
in
florida
and
indeed

will

i
think
this
is
a
solid
brew
its
worth
trying
o
for
the
price
its
a
solid
value
when
i
first
got
into
craft
maybe
20
years
ago
there
was
sam
adams
cream
stout
and
guinness
you
could
find
the
extra
stout
in
bottles
but
everyone
wanted
the
draught
once
they
started
releasing
that
in
cans
then
all
i
heard
was
that
i
needed
the
fes
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
its
nice
to
finally
experience
in
whats
supposed
to
be
its
best
form
finally
available
in
these
parts
it
pours
a
dark
garnettinted

topped
by
a

of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
coffee
pretzels
very
light
roasted
malts
salted
cashews
and
a
touch
of
dark
wheat
the
taste
kicks
the
roast
up
a
bit
adding
a
very
mild
touch
of
bitter
dark
chocolate
and
finishing
with
a
small
scraping
of
charcoal
the
body
is
a
strong
medium
with
a
verylight
moderate
carbonation
a
smoothly
chewy
feel
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
this
is
indeed
a
stepup
from
the
normal
guinness
but
not
really
that
big
of
one
it
is
definitely
denser
and
drier
with
more
of
a
roasted
character
but
the
drinkability
remains
the
same
and
the
flavors
dont
really
pop

i

love
this
a

with

the

is

the

a

to

a

stout
even

i

it
at

is

of

very

faint

not

plus
something
that
makes
me

of

and
some

less
roasted
than
guinness
foreign
extra
boozier
too
but
that
may
be
from
the
pronounced

could
make
an

dont
think
they
have

it
comes
to
beer
down

reaching
for
this

micheal
lewis
includes
detailed
tech
specs
for
this
beer
in
his
classic
beer
style
series
book
on
stout
of
note
t
his
beer
contains
caramel
coloring
and
brewers
corn
syrup
ugh
and
the
brewer
saw
fit
to
note
that
the
beer
employs
a
special
beer
flavoring
extract
for
flavor
maturation
um
what
the
fuck
that
sounds
sinister
but
i
suppose
it
could
mean
almost
anything
including
adding
soured
or
otherwise
aged
beer
to
fresh
batches
in
any
event
my
expectations
were
not
terribly
high
and
perhaps
because
of
this
the
beer
exceeded
them
aroma
includes
the
expected
coffee
and
chocolate
elements
but
there
is
also
a
distinct
graininess
that
comes
off
like
cheap
sixrow
malt
and
a
fruity
character
that
comes
off
a
bit
like
tart
red
wine
and
cherry
syrup
this
tartness
carries
over
onto
the
palate
as
well
a
vinous
character
that
ive
encountered
in
other
stouts
and
porters
here
and
there
not
unwelcome
amidst
the
smoky
caramel
and
chocolate
milk
flavors
maybe
a
little
molasses
comes
off
as
overly
attenuated
with
the
body
too
thin
and
the
carbonation
too
high
finishes
rather
grainy
and
astringent
almost
a
low
grade
alcohol
burn
the
sweetness
becomes
cloying
quite
quickly
and
this
could
be
one
of
the
sweetest
stouts
ive
sampled
to
date
still
not
undrinkable
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
from
a
noncraft
island
brewery
mark
out
of
a
hundred
79
dragon
stout
poured
a
very
dark
cola
brown
that
was
impervious
to
light
with
about
1
5
of
bubbly
tan
head
which
quickly
faded
to
a
thin
collar
of
foam
leaving
some
modest
lacing
down
the
glass
its
aroma
was
a
mix
of
the
good
and
not
quite
so
gooda
sweet
chocolate
milk
with
a
not
so
pleasant
herbal
smell
thrown
in
for
good
measure
luckily
the
flavour
was
more
pleasant
than
the
aroma
a
boozy
sweet
chocolate
milk
with
a
hint
of
dark
roasted
coffee
quite
nice
though
not
as
flavourful
as
most
north
american
stouts
almost
no
bitterness
to
this
beer
the
carbonation
was
soft
as
you
would
expect
from
a
stout
detectable
more
at
the
back
of
the
throat
than
on
the
tongue
and
the
beer
had
a
creamy
mouth
feel
i
would
call
this
brew
medium
bodied
on
balance
and
reasonably
priced
at
2
00
per
300
ml
bottle
overall
not
bad
and
given
the
climate
in
which
it
is
normally
consumed
i
can
understand
why
this
beer
is
not
as
rich
as
its
north
american
counterparts
this
is
a
very
serviceable
export
stout
not
the
best
ever
but
quite
tasty
nonetheless
i
found
it
a
bit
overly
sweet
with
muffled
hops
and
relatively
low
complexity
from
what
i
know
stouts
are
very
common
in
the
caribbean
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
native
stout
jamaica
produces
sugar
coffee
spices
and
molasses
all
of
these
are
present
in
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
time
at
the
resorts
in
jamaica
would
order
again
if
say
i
was
skipping
a
meal
while
vacationing
enjoy
deep
dark
brownish
almost
black
in
color
the
beer
has
a
thick
blanketlike
head
its
aroma
is
average
a
hint
of
malt
some
roasted
grains
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
very
sweet
think
continental
european
stout
sweet
with
a
little
spice
cloying
at
times
with
a
fleshy
fruitiness
dark
the
finish
is
moderately
balanced
with
some
bitterness
which
just
prevents
cloying
still
the
beer
is
creamy
and
full
and
satisfying
a
pleasant
wellflavoured
export
stout
the
malt
running
rampant
here
to
a
certain
degree
traditional
warming
and
pretty
drinkable
id
sure
like
to
get
a
bottle
of
island
guinness
fes
to
compare
side
by
side
with
this
prost
lampertland
picked
this
up
at
turnpike
wine
spirits
in
oak
ridge
tn
as
part
of
a
pick
and
choose
assortment
of
porters
and
stouts
didnt
know
anything
about
it
but
took
notice
of
it
the
minute
i
poured
it
in
the
glass
the
appearance
was
excellent
and
the
head
was
perfect
the
taste
was
most
excellent
chocolate
and
coffee
present
the
creamy
texture
was
the
icing
on
the
cake
this
is
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
o
interesting
and
decent
the
depth
in
flavor
was
more
than
i
was
expecting
but
the
oiliness
was
a
bit
off
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
more
than
the
9
6
oz
in
one
sitting
o
overall
a
good
no
frills
stout
thats
a
good
session
beer
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
mellow
coffee
like
maltiness
in
the
taste
a
small
alcohol
presence
and
a
mellow
roasty
maltiness
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
roasty
malt
with
coffee
and
caramel
like
aftertaste
mellow
yet
a
boozy
taste
a
nice
mix
of
coffee
and
caramel
malts
overall
decent
stout
but
very
sweet
and
missing
some
bitterness
to
cut
through
and
make
this
even
better
strong
and
sweet
beer
with
good
depth
of
flavour
and
a
lot
going
on
with
it
a
good
beer
to
drink
and
one
that
despite
the
hints
of
alcohol
also
went
down
very
easily
probably
not
quite
as
good
as
lion
stout
but
certainly
a
beer
i
would
have
again
should
the
opportunity
arise
this
was
much
better
than
id
anticipated
i
definitely
preferred
it
to
nigerian
guinness
which
is
probably
the
closest
thing
ive
had
it
didnt
have
the
unpleasant
lactic
sourness
of
the
guinness
unfortunately
the
wellbalanced
flavour
profile
wasreally
let
down
by
excessive
carbonation
sit
back
and
be
prepared
for
a
total
mouth
orgasm
the
beer
almost
succeeds
as
a
tropical
version
of
stout
but
its
flimsy
middle
palate
and
finish
allows
the
beer
to
fall
apart
and
expose
harsher
and
mild
artificial
taste
still
its
the
best
product
that
ive
yet
to
try
from
the
makers
of
red
stripe
o
for
a
tropical
foreign
stout
this
is
on
still
sweet
estery
and
balanced
overall
not
really
the
best
foreign
stout
i
have
had
it
is
almost
like
it
needs
more
hops
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
also
the
flavors
are
just
not
very
pronounced
really
not
something
worth
seeking
out
final
thoughts
when
i
first
looked
at
this
beer
i
thought
that
a
stout
from
jamaica
would
be
awful
however
desnoes
geddes
seem
to
me
to
be
the
best
of
caribbean
beer
i
wouldnt
say
its
epicly
good
but
its
certainly
worth
seeking
out
pretty
nice
and
enjoyable
stout
traditional
profile
and
does
that
quite
well
dryness
on
the
end
is
good
not
the
best
ive
had
but
still
a
really
good
brew
that
deserves
a
try
rjt
overall
typical
milk
stout
however
the
malts
are
especially
hidden
here
overall
sweet
but
not
overly
so
for
me
i
was
skeptical
about
a
stout
in
the
tropics
but
i
found
it
to
be
actually
very
refreshing
much
more
so
than
i
would
have
imagined
it
could
be
one
of
those
beers
that
i
think
directly
represents
where
it
is
brewed
might
seem
too
sweet
or
unbalanced
if
i
were
drinking
it
at
home
in
new
england
but
perfect
for
the
location
and
climate
of
jamaica
during
the
afternoon
i
wandered
down
the
beach
and
sampled
other
very
tasty
jamaican
products
in
a
beach
shack
with
some
locals
very
nice
and
also
recommended
for
visitors
all
in
all
dragon
was
part
of
my
perfect
jamaican
buzz
o
better
than
average
but
below
great
i
would
say
gaverage
not
a
bad
brew
and
better
than
i
anticipated
very
low
hop
profile
and
sweet
yet
it
works
somehow
decent
but
very
sweet
it
has
no
roasted
malt
character
or
hop
bitterness
easy
drinking
and
has
a
pleasing
texture
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
as
its
a
little
cloying
but
quite
drinkable
and
makes
a
change
from
your
typical
strong
stout
d
pretty
drinkable
this
was
a
nice
beer
that
had
a
lot
of
sweet
flavors
to
it
and
a
pretty
decent
abv
i
liked
it
i
just
wish
the
bottle
was
a
full
1216oz
a
decent
option
instead
of
guinness
when
you
want
something
a
little
stronger
and
roastier
i
e
like
a
stout
salud
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
coffee
notes
to
it
with
a
light
chocolate
aroma
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
had
some
brown
sugar
sweetness
along
with
a
roasted
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
i
felt
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
body
overall
this
stout
was
interesting
i
would
try
it
again
if
the
mood
struck
me
o
this
is
my
second
time
drinking
this
beer
and
i
can
definitely
say
that
its
a
proper
foreign
stout
rich
and
creamy
warming
and
delightful
i
honestly
wouldnt
expect
so
much
out
of
a
jamaican
beer
would
make
an
excellent
afterdinner
drink
final
grade
3
31
a
b
definitely
the
best
jamaican
beer
i
have
thus
far
enjoyed
nice
creamy
but
short
lasting
head
a
deep
rich
chocolate
malt
taste
crisper
aftertaste
than
most
stouts
since
this
is
a
foreign
export
stout
id
be
curious
to
know
what
the
jamaicans
keep
for
themselves
a
guinness
for
example
tastes
much
different
in
dublin
than
in
new
york
i
know
from
experiencesurprisingly
smooth
for
15
proof
im
old
schoolin
fact
ill
explain
for
those
who
dont
know
proof
is
an
older
measure
of
ethanol
in
a
beverage
in
the
u
s
proof
2x
the
abv
of
a
liquid
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
balanced
on
the
sweeter
side
of
the
spectrum
o
not
too
bad
at
all
its
a
fairly
drinkable
higher
abv
stout
thats
incredibly
roasted
and
earthy
in
nature
overall
smell
is
lacking
and
the
taste
is
more
than
lacking
as
well
not
to
mention
the
watered
down
mouth
feel
this
is
just
not
a
stout
for
me
in
any
way
shape
or
form
probably
would
not
get
this
one
again
and
definitely
would
not
go
anywhere
out
of
my
way
to
acquire
it
i
mean
if
im
ever
in
jamaica
i
would
drink
it
again
over
the
other
adjunct
garbage
that
is
probably
served
there
but
this
one
is
just
not
for
me
with
so
many
other
great
choices
around
o
this
didnt
seem
like
a
stout
to
me
tasted
more
like
a
dark
ale
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
overall
i
found
the
levels
of
carbonation
a
little
too
high
and
that
the
beer
was
more
like
a
dubbel
than
a
stout
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
and
it
was
fairly
light
on
the
palette
im
happy
i
gave
this
one
a
try
taste
is
smooth
and
the
sugar
comes
through
here
light
on
carbonation
i
have
served
this
almost
as
a
desert
well
certainly
with
desert
chocolate
cherry
this
is
almost
a
port
replacement
d
id
go
back
to
this
beer
after
another
as
long
as
they
get
that
copper
taste
out
could
have
been
a
bad
batch
after
not
cleaning
the
lines
or
using
that
metal
spoon
also
the
red
stripe
style
of
a
small
bottle
makes
this
easy
to
go
back
to
back
on
d
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
caribbean
stout
i
particularly
enjoyed
the
finish
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
a
sampler
glass
at
a
beer
festival
from
notes
pours
a
clear
dark

with
a
medium
tan
head
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
dark
malty
notes
sweet
coffee
and
a
faint
roastiness
the
taste
is
very
sweet
and
almost
sugary
with
notes
of
coffee
and
faint
roasty
notes
very
faint
hops
and
nearly
no
bitterness
at
all

would
make
me
come
back
to
try
it

never
again

im
surprised
a
stout
this
good
is
jamaican
i

it
is
my
ignorance
that
thinks
of
red

ginger

get

licorice
with
something
else
that
make
the
smell
bad
taste
is
so
light
it
is
sad
some
chocolate
no
bitterness
this
beer
needs
some
work
feels
like
water
in
the
mouth
d
two
to
four
good
sips
and
ive
had
enough
of
this
one
this
beer
needs
some
lovin
from
humulus
lupulus
ie
stouts
are
best
when
balanced
d
overall
a
tasty
stout
and
a
pleasant
surprise
im
glad
i
went
out
of
my
way
to
find
a
bottle
locally
and
it
is
definitely
worthy
to
any
stout
fan
higher
abv
is
nicely
hidden
and
although
not
the
most
thirst
quenching
beer
in
the
caribbean
and
a
tad
thin
it
is
still
a
full
flavoured
stout
worthy
of
sourcing
out
the
cpj
overall
bb
drinkability
pleasant
if
undemanding
alcoholic
strength
not
obvious
would
definitely
drink
this
again
d
easily
drinkable
but
i
would
probably
go
for
something
with
a
stronger
flavor
poured
a
viscous
black
with
a
finger
or
so
of
reddish
brown
head
which
falls

is
some
milky
creamy
chocolate
some
light
coffee
and
sweet
coconut
albeit
a
lesser
contribution
than
the
other
two
taste
is
relatively
uneventful
some
chocolate
with
a
lactic
creaminess
mild
dark
fruits

in

is
a
bit
weird
and
chalky
with

thats
a
bit
high
in
my
eyes
medium
drinkability
you
win
this
round
jamaica
clearly
i
wasnt
expecting
such
a
sweet
drinkable
stout
no
less
from
the
brewers
that
put
forward
red
stripe
a
passable
but
boring
pale
lager
too
sweet
for
everyday
or
session
drinking
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
sweet
to
sip
after
dinner
or
to
serve
with
dessert
and
is
cheap
and
regularly
available
weve
found
your
man
despite
the
treatening
name
this
dragon
doesnt
pose
much
of
a
threat
its
pretty
tame
and
just
wants
to
like
you
and
take
you
on
cool
adventures
why
not
let
it
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
which
dies
down
to
a
few
patches
nose
is
an
uninspiring
mix
of
roasted
malts
musty
coffee
and
a
hint
of
bakers
chocolate
taste
follows
suit
with
a
healthy
dose
of
dark
fruits
and
a
weird
cola
taste
chemical
sugar
sweetness
odd
mineral
dryness
in
the
finish
way
too
fizzy
too
thin
i
can
imagine
this
is
a
welcome
relief
from
all
the
light
lagers
in
jamaica
but
here
there
are
too
many
other
far
superior
beers
to
visit
this
one
again
pours
dark
black
with
a
half
inch
of
head
that
leaves
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
much
lighter
than
i
expected
sweet
and
aromatic
the
flavor
is
also
lighter
than
i
would
expect
from
a
stout
it
manages
to
be
light
and
sweet
at
the
same
time
with
just
a
hint
of
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
background
i
would
never
guess
from
aroma
and
taste
that
this
was
7
5
alcohol
i
guess
this
is
a
good
stout
for
a
warm
clime
like
jamaica
d
this
was
an
interesting
go
and
its
probably
worth
a
try
but
it
wont
be
a
regular
purchase
i
had
this
beer
in
belize
while
on
vacation
and
was
surprised
to
find
it
here
in
mass
clearly
not
a
highly
rated
beer
but
i
was
surprised
by
the
wide
range
of
reviews
for
what
it
is
a
jamacian
stout
it
is
very
sweet
and
drinkable
there
is
a
nice
alcohol
finish
mixed
with
a
hint
of
malts
it
certainly
isnt
a
go
to
beer
but
when
compare
to
the
beers
available
in
belize
its
not
a
bad
choice
d
i
dont
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
this
ever
again
ill
have
a
root
beer
if
i
want
flavours
like
this
what
a
let
down
i
expected
a
rich
stout
i
got
an
overly
sweet
boozy
drink
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
not
something
i
will
be
revisiting
unless
i
find
it
on
tap
or
something

com20101012tastingthedragonstout
d
a
delicious
stout
id
definitely
have
another
one
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
carbonation
is
perfect
to
make
the
beer
just
a
bit
lively
theres
a
nice
sweet
aftertaste
with
minimal
hops
or
lingering
roast
i
cant
wait
to
get
back
to
montego
bay
again
to
have
some
dragon
just
a
fantastic
beer
the
taste
of
paradise
for
me
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
good
a
sweet
pleasing
taste
coupled
with
a
great
smell
and
a
creamy
feel
make
this
brew
eminently
quaffable
very
well
done
and
something
i
will
keep
a
lookout
for
in
the
future
more
of
a
looker
than
i
remember
seems
well
made
with
an
excellent
half
inch
light
tan
head
which
forms
easily
and
goes
the
distance
black
with
a
fine
cola
light
line
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
quite
sweet
and
creamy
are
the
dominant
elements
throughout
chilled
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
but
once
the
cool
runnings
are
over
it
celebrates
that
heady
7
5
booze
goes
well
with
goat
roti
though
d
the
light
body
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
drinkable
during
warmer
months
the
only
thing
that
slowed
me
down
in
drinking
it
faster
was
the
sweetness
small
bottle
284
ml
poured
into
a
ommegang
chalice
this
has
a
thick
dark
appearance
with
a
small
amount
of
lacing
on
the
head
smell
is
very
sweet
with
hints
of
raisins
and
brown
sugar
taste
is
also
sweet
filled
with
sugarcovered
raisins
and
plums
no
roasted
malt
flavor
and
very
sugary
fairly
thinbodied
for
a
stout
excellent
drinkability
however
as
this
goes
down
very
easily
pours
opaque
black
with
tan
head
and
some
lacing
smell
has
a
huge
malty
thing
going
on
with
some
roast
there
seems
to
be
some
type
of
odd
smell
as
well
maybe
some
lactic
syrupy
sweetness
taste
is
incredibly
sweet
but
there
is
something
that
is
a
bit
sour
there
too
body
is
a
little
bit
thin
i
still
enjoy
this
beer
and
buy
it
sometimes
a
really
great
example
of
an
export
stout
solid
brew
to
pick
up
if
you
see
it
around
d
its
good
got
the
crack
in
it
gogogo
back
for
more
would
go
great
with
munchies
foods
bbq
chicken
not
an
uppercrust
stout
a
disappointing
experience
i
may
revisit
in
the
future
inky
black
aroma
of
molasses
and
caramel
sticky
sweetness
yet
light
enough
to
be
quite
drinakble
the
molasses
quality
hides
the
alcohol
here
interesting
that
this
sort
of
sweet
heavy
beer
doesnt
cloy
and
i
am
able
to
drink
a
succession
of
these
good
with
spicy
food
i
must
add
that
i
generally
drink
this
beer
warm
because
thats
the
way
the
locals
drink
it
where
i
stay
in
jamaica
warm
or
cold
its
always
a
treat
for
me
d
although
the
abv
is
high
for
a
regular
ale
its
in
keeping
with
a
foreignexport
stout
and
the
smaller
serving
size
keeps
this
in
check
in
spite
of
its
punch
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
not
quite
black
with
a
small
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
goes
into
a
thin
film
that
has
great
lacing
for
a
moment
then
it
slids
back
into
the
beer
i
found
the
aroma
very
enjoyable
yet
hard
to
describe
sure
the
hint
of
roasted
malt
is
there
as
well
as
an
alcohol
scent
but
there
is
also
this
milky
sweet
smell
too
and
it
made
me
want
to
take
a
sip
a
very
interesting
taste
too
very
thin
for
a
stout
and
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
pretty
easy
with
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
and
a
background
of
sweetness
you
can
feel
the
carbonation
more
here
than
in
most
stouts
and
a
slight
burn
of
alcohol
on
the
tongue
for
a
stout
it
almost
seems
waterd
down
but
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
d
doesnt
measure
up
to
other
export
stouts
but
it
was
better
than
i
expected
d
as
said
not
undrinkable
but
this
particular
bottle
wasnt
great
im
not
sure
if
something
fresh
would
have
a
creamier
body
or
more
malty
flavour
and
would
like
to
try
it
again
if
i
could
find
it
with
a
more
recent
bottling
a
worthy
experience
if
you
happen
upon
it
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
better
than
the
scores
indicate
not
the
absolute
top
in
the
category
but
at
least
equal
if
not
a
bit
better
than
lion
stout
imo
i
dont
remember
this
being
this
sugary
and
sweet
when
i
had
it
a
few
years
ago
in
jamaica
slightly
disappointed
but
still
happy
to
have
this
again
pours
a
nearly
opaque
blackbrown
with
about
a
halffinger
of
frothy
ecru
head
theres
a
small
but
good
amount
of
lacing
produced
the
nose
is
quite
faint
chocolate
coffee
and
dark
malts
are
all
i
really
get
olfactorily
the
taste
follows
for
the
most
part
though
the
coffee
is
decidedly
subdued
the
chocolate
is
lightly
bittered
and
the
dark
malts
lean
toward
the
wheaty
side
the
body
is
a
strong
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
a
smooth
feel
and
a
surprisingly
dry
finish
overall
i
wouldnt
describe
this
brew
as
the
best
stout
ive
ever
had
but
its
still
pretty
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
not
bad
nothing
exciting
could
drink
a
couple
d
goes
down
very
easily
poured
from
a
brown
284ml

a

is
very
sweet

and
finishing
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quality
beer
pours

black

excellent

with
a
hint
of
coffee
very
inviting
taste

hidden
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
almost
syrupy
could
almost
be
served
slightly
warmed
smoothness
and
lack
of
harsh
alcohol
notes
make
this
very
drinkable
in
general
im
disappointed
by
this
brew
its
not
what
im
looking
for
from
a
stout
would
i
buy
more
of
it
umm
probably
not
unless
i
was
in
jamaica
and
i
was
already
a
little
tipsy
or
cwapfaced
labeled
as
an
export
stout
it
seems
to
be
a
milksweet
stout
nose
is
huge
in
what
i
suspect
to
be
lactose
it
also
has
minor
traces
of
coffee
and
hops
taste
is
dominate
by
sweetness
followed
with
bits
of
coffee
and
chocolate
character
blackdark
brown
in
color
tanned
head
doesnt
offer
much
retension
as
the
beer
warms
the
alcohol
becomes
a
bit
more
noticeable
and
dark
fruit
flavors
start
to
come
out
d
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
stout
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
well
this
is
an
interesting
beer
not
at
all
as
i
would
have
expected
definitely
more
of
a
quadstout
combo
strange
beer
i
like
it
d
due
to
the
overall
sweetness
and
mid
abv
this
is
a
sipper
sit
back
and
enjoy
kind
of
thin
and
not
overly
syrupy
but
overall
still
too
darn
sweet
to
consume
too
many
of
these
not
a
bad
brew
i
just
would
rather
be
sipping
it
with
my
feet
in
the
sand
on
a
beach
in
jamaica
d
excellent
i
will
be
getting
more
whenever
possible
sweet
and
malty
with
little
complexity
of
flavor
easy
to
drink
warm
or
cold
although
my
tongue
discerns
adjunctscorn
this
offering
is
a
nationaljamaicaicon
and
a
regional
favorite
very
drinkable
full
bodied
with
low
carbonation
creamy
had
this
two
or
three
years
back
and
couldnt
handle
how
sweet
and
chewy
it
was
but
having
it
now
i
think
i
like
it
a
bit
more
still
not
something
id
want
all
the
time
though
it
still
gets
progressively
harder
to
drink
the
closer
you
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
cloying
the
taste
is
maximally
creamy
the
is
one
of
the
creamiest
stouts
ive
had
this
is
definitely
full
bodied
very
sweet
almost
lactose
stout
sweet
with
lots
of
chocolate
malts
honey
molasses
and
some
roasted
notes
there
might
be
some
cherry
chocolate
soda
in
there
as
well
there
is
definitely
a
throaty
burn
and
lots
of
abv
with
the
beer
the
beer
is
like
oil
on
the
tongue
with
a
sweet
buttery
molasses
residue
in
the
mouth
and
beyond
this
is
a
sipping
beer
for
sure
it
is
quite
good
is
full
palated
makes
a
strong
statement
there
isnt
much
hop
there
isnt
much
roasted
or
charred
notes
to
the
beer
and
it
is
very
much
tilted
to
the
sweet
creamy
side
of
the
ledger
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
d
very
good
at
first
but
becomes
slightly
sickly
after
roughly
23s
of
the
small
bottle
i
was
ending
the
night
with
this
beer
but
i
think
ill
have
to
dump
it
and
have
something
i
know
is
good
to
hopefully
cleanse
my
mouth
of
this
sickly
sweet
yuckfest
or
maybe
i
should
just
brush
my
teeth
and
cry
myself
to
sleep
blech
d
too
sweet
and
the
alcohol
and
bitterness
on
the
end
doesnt
work
for
me
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
it
should
also
be
noted
that
this
beer
is
an
amazing
value
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
will
set
you
back
10
and
change
from
the
liqbo
cad
of
course
which
puts
it
on
par
with
some
of
the
macro
cheapies
its
flavourful
and
unique
if
a
little
onedimensional
but
should
please
casual
drinkers
and
beer
geeks
alike
plus
its
7
5
which
means
it
packs
a
serious
punch
you
dont
need
too
many
of
these
to
get
a
buzz
if
thats
what
youre
after
great
stuff
d
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
d
i
tried
and
could
not
do
it
done
after
three
ounces
could
only
take
tiny
sips
when
i
tried
to
take
anymore
my
senses
stopped
me
putrid
sometimes
it
pays
to
live
on
the
wild
and
adventurous
side
but
not
in
this
case
down
the
drain
overall
the
almost
cloying
sweetness
pronounced
abv
and
strange
oily
medicinal
notes
made
this
a
pretty
unenjoyable
stout
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
another
one
of
these
any
time
soon
aroma
is
fairly
strong
smoky
oily
and
coffeeish
pours
a
dark
chocolaty
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
but
not
too
persistent
beige
head
flavor
is
malty
smoky
and
surprisingly
sweet
but
not
cloying
there
are
hints
of
molasses
and
apple
cider
texture
is
quite
smooth
with
just
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
and
minimal
fizziness
not
too
shabby
tastes
like
a
harpoon
chocolate
stout
good
beer
except
brewed
with
sewage
water
d
for
me
its
slips
down
my
throat
with
ease
but
for
those
moving
from
regular
dry
stouts
or
guinness
get
ready
for
the
taste
to
be
full
of
sweetness
i
have
my
fair
share
of
critiques
of
the
dragon
stout
the
exaggerated
sweetness
the
unmasked
alcohol
but
ive
always
felt
to
really
know
a
beer
and
truly
experience
it
at
its
best
you
must
try
it
fresh
in
its
native
land
unless
desnoes
geddes
want
to
pay
my
way
to
jamaica
ill
have
to
believe
this
is
just
an
average
foreign
stout
its
not
something
i
see
myself
drinking
again
here
in
canada
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
very
little
head
smells
sweet
and
milky
with
caramel
and
cream
and
just
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
fairly
simple
but
well
enough
crafted
tastes
sweet
creamy
and
lightly
fruity
with
a
little
ashiness
on
the
finish
smooth
and
simple
but
actually
quite
delicious
ive
always
liked
the
sweet
strong
stout
tradition
in
the
carribean
it
makes
it
a
hell
of
a
lot
easier
to
get
a
tasty
beer
instead
of
your
usual
macro
lager
this
is
my
favorite
jamaican
beer
dragon
stout
is
a
black
ale
with
a
thick
bubbly
caramel
brown
head
that
shows
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
with
notes
of
molasses
and
brown
sugar
there
seems
to
be
a
smokiness
to
it
its
pretty
full
bodied
and
very
smooth
it
is
thick
and
chewy
with
a
clean
finish
it
tastes
very
sweet
and
a
little
grassy
there
are
notes
of
rum
and
toffee
there
is
a
slightly
smoky
note
at
the
finish
its
nice
but
very
sweet
its
a
good
thing
its
in
such
a
small
bottle
i
had
a
few
bottles
of
this
last
summer
aging
the
beer
has
definitely
smoothed
out
some
of
the
rougher
edges
i
noticed
at
the
time
its
a
welcome
change
of
pace
from
the
more
typical
heavilyroasted
examples
of
this
style
got
this
little
bad
boy
at
a
small
quick
stop
in
grand
cayman
right
close
to
where
they
make
the
tortuga
rum
cakes
the
beer
had
a
very
thick
and
fluffy
head
that
lasted
a
good
bit
then
died
out
to
a
very
thin
laceing
the
smell
was
of
sweet
malts
and
chocolate
taste
was
similar
but
very
sweet
so
sweet
that
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
i
will
say
this
is
a
far
cry
from
dgs
other
beer
red
stripe
i
do
like
the
red
stripe
but
this
is
stronger
and
sweeter
overall
not
too
bad
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
picked
up
a
single
for
around
two
bucks
at
the
whole
foods
in
cambridge
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
dark
black
color
with
a
hint
of
brown
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
good
head
and
nice
lacing
noticeable
smell
of
roasted
barley
taste
surprised
me
am
i
drinking
a
milk
stout
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
good
but
it
caught
me
off
guard
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
also
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
but
i
would
have
preferred
it
after
a
meal
as
a
nice
dessert
if
i
had
known
overall
this
one
was
a
surprise
it
was
very
solid
very
enjoyable
and
i
would
definitely
have
another
like
other
export
stouts
this
one
would
not
be
a
good
choice
for
a
session
but
id
definitely
have
a
few
it
was
very
enjoyable
right
to
the
last
drop
pitch
black
beer
with
a
rich
thick
slowly
fading
head
aroma
is
cocoa
taste
is
chocolatemolassescocoa
ans
alcohol
on
the
back
end
this
is
a
very
sweet
pleasant
tasting
stout
i
would
recommend
and
buy
againalthough
i
doubt
you
could
drink
more
than
three
of
these
at
one
sitting
full
bodied
and
mouth
coating
this
is
one
that
i
bought
as
a
single
and
it
was
enough
to
satisfy
my
curiousity
and
my
stout
fix
and
in
the
crappy
store
i
got
it
from
who
knows
how
long
this
single
has
been
around
i
think
i
got
lucky
somewhat
different
but
enjoyable
enough
to
give
a
shot
worthy
overall
id
say
this
is
too
sweet
and
sugary
for
my
taste
to
have
more
than
one
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
candy
toasted
malt
chocolate
and
licorice
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
meaning
that
its
sweet
without
much
else
to
give
it
character
the
palate
is
average
at
best
overall
not
a
great
stout
but
certainly
drinkable
thanks
to
nash
for
the
bottle
not
much
bottle
smell
but
the
high
ac
seems
evident
mªn
pours
to
an
opaque
black
with
a
tan
head
that
is
both
macro
bubble
and
creamy
mªn
taste
is
sweeter
than
expected
for
a
stout
not
really
prevelant
in
chocolate
or
roasted
malts
but
more
of
a
roasted
cane
molasses
and
chocolate
syrup
flavor
mªn
carbonation
is
good
but
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
stout
mªn
hopping
is
there
but
doesnt
come
through
bitter
mªn
this
is
almost
more
like
an
hg
dark
brown
english
ale
more
so
than
a
stout
mªn
but
its
a
good
brew
for
the
heat
mªn
poured
from
a
10
oz
or
so
bottle
pours
a
nice
dark
red
almost
black
color
with
a
tan
creamy
head
smell
is
of
sweet
malts
and
alcohol
taste
is
of
the
same
the
alcohol
is
very
pronounced
in
this
beer
i
mean
its
7
5
abv
but
ive
had
things
that
were
1112
that
hid
the
alcohol
better
has
a
very
rum
like
taste
to
it
with
the
sugars
and
all
basically
its
like
a
rumbeer
which
is
good
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
that
ill
pass
on
this
in
the
future
pours
a
medium
shade
of
black
with
a
deep
red
color
along
the
sides
their
is
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
a
ring
along
the
outside
of
the
beer
this
has
a
huge
roasted
malt
aroma
with
some
cocoa
and
espresso
notes
to
it
as
well
this
is
a
sweet
beer
the
first
thing
that
you
taste
is
the
sweet
malt
and
then
the
alcohol
taste
kicks
in
this
one
is
tough
to
describe
as
their
is
a
light
burnt
sugar
taste
and
some
cocoa
and
roasted
flavors
as
well
this
is
a
moderately
carbonated
beer
and
quite
sweet
which
might
make
it
to
tough
to
drink
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
two
shades
shy
of
black
with
mahogany
highlights
around
the
edges
half
inch

dissipated
into
a
thin
ring
around
the
shoulders
within
30
seconds
no
lacing
on
this
one
nose
was
alcohol
dark
fruit
and
a
trace
of
cocoa
taste
is
a
little
difficult
to
describe
flavors
are
consistent
with
nose
but
a
little
too
sugary
sweet
mouthfeel
was
lightboded
and
effervescent
but
also
a
little
syrupy
interesting
brew
but
one
was
definitely
enough
cute
little
bottle
pours
very
dark
with
a
good
light
brown
head
that
retains
decently
smells
of
cocoa
a
bit
of
roastiness
and
overripe
dark

taste
is
more
overripe
dark
fruits
ala
figs
plums
raisins
etc
over
the
top
sweetness
semi
dry
finish
lightly
carbonated
alcohol
warmth
very
present
im
not
sure
if
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
these
as
its
somewhat
of
a
chore
to
finish
only
one
of
these
guys
from
a
small
284ml
bottle
way
too
sweet
not
in
the
good
way
like
a
milk
stout
either
each
sip
makes
me
deliver
a
new
face
of
anguish
this
little
bottle
was
poured
into
a
small
great
lakes
christmas
ale
snifter
this
dragon
was
a
soild
midnight
black
i
checked
no
ray
of
light
could
penatrate
this
beers
soild
black
bodied
color
sitting
on
top
of
this
beer
was
a
creamy
1
inch
head
of
mocha
colored
foam
it
had
really
good
retention
by
leaving
behind
a
mocha
film
foamy
rings
and
a
fair
amount
of
mocha
spots
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
fruity
with
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
figs
but
it
was
also
slightly
roasted
at
the
same
time
roasted
dark
fruits
was
an
interesting
aroma
to
smell
the
taste
was
also
very
fruity
with
the
dark
fruits
but
this
time
there
wasnt
a
roasted
undertone
it
was
more
fruity
than
anything
else
the
taste
was
sweet
and
fruity
with
raisins
figs
a
tiny
touch
of
sweet
roasted
malts
a
smidge
of
sweet
caramel
and
then
finished
up
with
sweet
yeast
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
sweet
and
fruity
aftertaste
of
raisins
sweet
roasted
malts
caramel
and
more
yeast
this
had
to
be
the
most
fruity
and
sweet
stout
ive
ever
had
before
not
bad
at
all
i
wouldnt
have
mind
a
bigger
bottle
of
dragon
stout
thanks
to
rblwthacoz
for
the
brew
2nd
note
i
was
with
2
jamaican
coworkers
who
carry
had
this
one
out
of
hyland24s
stash
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
it
poured
black
with
a
brown
head
that
settled
quickly
there
was
no
aroma
of
note
on
this
one
for
me
but
the
taste
was
superb
brown
sugary
and
malty
taste
with
a
warm
alcohol
finish
the
sweetness
sticks
to
my
mouth
and
the
light
surprising
carbonation
clings
a
bit
but
in
a
good
way
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
and
look
forward
to
having
more
i
am
feeling
irie
after
just
one
the
7
5
apv
is
sneaky
good
mfd
i
enjoyed
the
taste
much
more
out
of
the
bottle
than
the
pint
glass
for
some
reason
my
buddy
nasty
came
to
the
same
conclusion
also
found
its
better
colder
which
is
unusual
i
find
for
a
stout
beware
these
go
down
smooth
and
could
lead
to
shots
fired
very
atypical
of
the
genre
though
possibly
an
attraction
for
some
though
not
an
expert
on
stouts
this
pales
in
comparison
to
something
like
guinness
export
strength
cant
say
that
id
recommend
it
though
definitely
worth
a
try
d
a
tad
to
sugary
would
be
an
understatement
imagine
a
cup
of
cold
coffee
with
10
teaspoons
of
sugar
added
if
thats
your
thing
then
this
is
your
beer
otherwise
keep
your
glucose
meter
handy
mfd
the
carbonation
tingled
my
tongue
this
stout
was
full
bodied
and
the
sweetness
coated
my
mouth
big
time
the
7
5
abv
assured
pleanty
of
alcoholic
warmth
you
may
be
tempted
to
session
this
one
but
be
careful
or
the
dragon
may
sneak
up
on
you
d
easy
on
the
palate
but
the
carbonation
alcohol
is
a
little
high
pours
very
dark
with
a
thin
tan
head
flavor
has
a
nice
very
mild
bitter
side
to
it
and
a
fuller
smooth
sweet
edge
milky
in
a
way
seems
to
be
some
molasses
on
there
as
well
feel
is
very
smooth
on
the
liquid
and
the
lower
carbonation
is
still
nicely
noticeable
i
think
this
is
a
great
stout
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
carries
a
nice
smooth
and
sweet
edge
pretty
darn
good
i
say
makes
me
happy
to
see
this
at
the
bodega
down
the
street
the
smell
of
spilt
and
rotten
milks
gotta
go
though
drinkability
is
average
it
is
thin
which
i
guess
is
good
for
such
a
warm
weather
climate
in
jamaica
the
taste
is
strong
so
it
may
be
rough
drinking
more
than
a
couple
of
these
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
stout
that
actually
tastes
alot
like
a
milksweet
stout
poured
up
black
as
ink
with
a
khakilight
brown
head
looked
good
just
as
id
hoped
smell
was
nothing
like
i
had
expected
it
actually
had
a
bit
of
a
bmc
smell
but
not
too
bad
i
was
surprised
to
find
little
or
no
typical
stout
aromas
here
ah
well
taste
was
quite
nice
and
thats
what
matters
most
its
sweet
and
malty
but
unlike
any
other
stout
i
have
ever
had
good
but
rather
strange
mouthfeel
was
much
too
thin
for
my
tastes
and
too
much
carbonation
as
well
overall
its
somewhat
drinkable
and
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
i
tried
this
beer
because
it
was
readily
available
in
a
west
indian
neighborhood
not
far
from
my
home
i
actually
do
not
mind
driving
20
minutes
to
pick
up
this
brew
whenever
the
urge
hitsand
it
provides
a
good
buzz
with
a
smooth
taste
good
beer
for
its
style
overall
its
not
terrible
but
not
a
great
stout
in
my
opinion
drinking
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
it
was
mellow
mouthfeel
wise
and
the
taste
was
semichocolatey
but
not
overpowering
id
drink
it
again
just
not
often
d
simply
too
sweet
with
no
bittering
to
balance
this
out
its
cloying
nature
makes
this
a
1
and
no
more
thanks
beer
d
not
heavey
which
makes
it
go
down
easy
for
a
7
5
however
the
mouthfeel
and
over
sweetness
brings
this
down
in
relation
to
its
style
d
super
drinkable
stout
even
at
the
7
5
i
could
have
another
this
one
started
off
well
with
the
appearance
and
the
nose
but
is
too
sweet
with
an
unusual
fruitiness
for
me
not
very
impressed
if
youre
going
to
go
jamaican
go
red
stripe
drinkability
i
cant
conceive
of
myself
ever
giving
this
beer
another
go
drinkable
no
i
did
not
find
it
to
be
anywhere
near
a
beverage
it
is
a
marinade
at
most
pours
a
fourfinger
light
brown
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
midnight
black
color
molasses
nose
light
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
flavor
is
sweet
molasses
but
not
cloying
with
a
clean
finish
nice
sweet
stout
but
not
a
five
like
i
thought
it
was
last
century
284ml
bottle
1
75
from
kappys
fresh
pond
jamaica
plain
ma
i
was
quite
a
bit
shocked
by
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
never
underestimate
jamaicas
ability
to
brew
a
dark
beer
i
tried
this
beer
on
september
14
2007
at
the
beer
bistro
in
toronto
the
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
into
the
glass
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
malts
coffee
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
silky
with
no
apparent
carbonation
the
flavour
was
a
combination
of
malt
and
fruit
cherry
like
cola
dark
when
poured
black
coffee
brown
head
half
finger
with
good
retention
theres
very
lively
carbonation
when
held
under
a
bright
light
most
below
the
surface
smells
of
caramel
apple
or
fresh
hard
candies
in
a
dish
sweet
tia
maria
coffee
taste
yeast
with
a
lingering
aftertaste
of
black
cherry
i
found
the
taste
developed
in
the
glass
at
first
quite
sweet
then
an
odd
flash
sour
mouthfeel
got
syrupy
as
it
warmed
taking
away
from
the
overall
attractiveness
of
this
jamaican
stout
and
it
got
a
bit
sweet
for
my
liking
i
really
liked
the
way
the
flavours
alternated
almost
sweet
and
sour
at
times
and
then
the
strong
blue
mountain
coffee
influence
well
worth
a
try
d
o
my
god
at
7
5
i
guess
6
would
be
great
but
i
was
pretty
happy
after
4
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
there
are
other
ptions
but
this
one
is
flavorful
and
its
not
your
run
of
the
mill
garbage
aka
guiness
tasty
and
drinkable
goes
well
with
a
cigar
dragon
stout
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
from
a
brown
284
ml
bottle
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
perhaps
a
bit
estery
as
well
in
the
aroma
which
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
the
flavor
is
interesting
i
really
prefer
dry
stouts
to
this
style
it
seems
quite
sweet
andor
estery
or
both
at
once
also
some
roasted
malt
flavors
body
is
on
the
thin
side
alcohol
is
strong
warming
is
noticeable
not
really
my
thing
but
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
quite
dark
with
ruby
highlights
glinting
around
the
edges
of
the
black
body
and
a
fairly
deep
tan
head
that
lasts
pretty
well
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
a
touch
sour
with
alcohol
showing
prominently
and
the
roasted
aromas
of
chocolate
and
coffee
being
overpowered
taste
is
equally
muddled
though
the
opening
flavours
are
pleasant
quite
sweet
up
front
the
chocolate
coming
through
well
until
the
sourness
and
alcohol
come
through
in
the
finish
and
wash
it
out
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
and
lacks
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
hampered
by
the
poor
finish
not
very
good
but
has
some
character
that
might
recommend
it
to
some
this
is
a
nice
brew
and
my
favourite
of
anything
i
sampled
in
jamaica
note
to
all
anytime
i
saw
this
brew
be
it
in
individual
bottles
or
in
a
six
pack
it
was
priced
significantly
lower
than
the
uberpopular
red
stripe
likely
because
they
know
that
most
americans
are
going
to
want
all
red
stripe
all
the
time
while
in
jamaica
that
said
while
the
price
on
the
red
stripe
was
still
fairly
reasonable
it
meant
the
price
of
the
dragon
stout
was
excellent
something
like
just
under
a
buck
a
bottle
when
buying
singles
and
this
was
at
the
grocery
store
at
our
resort
where
everything
was
pricey
you
cant
complain
when
the
best
beer
on
the
island
is
also
the
cheapest
well
worth
a
bit
of
an
extra
effort
to
find
in
jamaica
and
still
a
nice
stout
to
have
at
home
in
the
states
as
well
d
excellent
i
will
be
getting
more
purchased
this
last
november
in
jamaica
poured
into
a
pint
glass
large
2
finger
tan
head
present
after
an
aggressive
pour
typical
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
intense
lacing
but
pour
is
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
the
smell
is
odd
sweet
and
chalky
none
of
the
typical
stout
scents
i
e
coffee
chocolate
or
roasted
character
taste
is
not
balanced
at
all
way
too
sweet
with
very
little
hop
or
malt
balance
however
i
could
see
why
this
would
be
brewed
this
way
since
the
vast
majority
of
people
would
be
drinking
this
in
90
degree
heat
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
creamy
and
coats
the
mouth
its
very
nice
this
is
just
way
too
sweet
for
me
the
lack
of
balance
is
off
putting
as
well
recommended
if
youre
in
jamaica
otherwise
no
need
to
search
out
appearance
was
a
nice
typical
dark
stout
with
good
head
flavour
had
some
roasty
notes
but
mostly
just
sickly
sweet
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
this
stout
was
just
way
too
sweet
for
me
the
alcohol
was
hidden
nicely
would
be
a
good
substitute
for
chocolate
sauce
on
your
ice
cream
thats
how
sweet
this
was
no
noticable
hops
either
not
worth
trying
again
drinkability
is
great
the
sweetness
is
above
average
but
i
enjoy
it
balanced
and
enjoyable
that
said
i
think
its
missing
the
style
in
many
ways
theres
almost
no
roast
and
the
sweetness
and
fruityness
seems
too
high
for
the
style
a
very
enjoyable
beer
but
it
loses
points
for
this
md
surprisingly
smooth
and
palatable
very
sweet
and
well
bodied
a
total
surprise
and
a
good
one
if
i
find
more
of
this
ill
probably
pick
this
up
this
one
was
pretty
drinkable
although
the
sweetness
was
too
much
for
me
to
consider
this
one
as
session
fare
during
winter
in
nw
ontario
my
opinion
might
be
180
degrees
different
if
was
sitting
on
a
hot
beach
in
jamaica
however
there
was
a
nice
roastiness
to
this
brew
that
makes
it
worth
trying
it
may
also
serve
as
a
good
stout
try
for
the
stout
novices
as
the
sweetness
may
make
it
more
approachable
ill
probably
drink
this
one
again
may
make
a
good
summer
stout
i
find
this
beer
to
be
unbalanced
lacking
in
hops
to
balance
all
of
the
sugar
nonetheless
i
enjoyed
it
its
like
liquid
candy
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
and
settles
black
with
a
pinky
sized
mocha
colored
head
that
is
mostly
lasting
the
aroma
holds
molasses
raisins
sweet
toasty
chocolate
and
a
light
perfumey
alcohol
in
fairly
strong
concentration
the
fore
is
sweet
raisin
mash
brown
sugar
and
molasses
and
that
tastes
rather
schwarzbierlike
probably
too
sweet
for
some
and
solidly
more
a
tropical
stout
but
is
nice
to
my
palate
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
barely
carbonated
it
manages
to
be
creamy
inspite
of
a
rather
thin
body
the
beer
drinks
ok
overall
i
wouldnt
want
to
session
this
one
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
recommended
pours
a
dense
dark
brownish
black
with
a
three
finger
head
that
dissipates
slowly
aroma
of
chocolate
and
molasses
tastes
pretty
much
how
it
smells
but
quite
sweet
and
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
bite
nice
lacing
but
too
sweet
for
my
liking
and
the
finish
is
rough
because
of
it
pours
a
dark
brownblack
some
reddish
hues
thick
tan
head
forms
sticks
around
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
sweet
some
cherries
and
toffee
chocolate
lots
of
alcohol
taste
is
weird
strange
artificial
flavour
some
cherryfruits
light
roast
alcohol
no
idea
where
this
is
going
very
weak
finish
watery
flavour
mouthfeel
is
thin
low
carbonation
somewhat
unpleasant
jh
very
smooth
taste
but
i
would
rather
have
a
thick
stout
taste
over
something
that
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
very
acceptable
alternative
to
the
more
expensive
stouts
as
low
cost
beers
go
this
is
probably
one
of
your
better
options
it
is
cheaper
than
other
stouts
and
widely
available
here
in
the
heart
of
brookyln
i
would
definitely
not
pass
up
a
rogue
stone
imperial
russian
or
brooklyn
black
chocolate
stout
for
one
of
these
but
as
far
as
bodega
beers
go
this
one
is
not
a
bad
choice
you
probably
wont
get
ripped
off
either
sweet
slightly
sticky
but
not
unpleasant
not
the
sort
of
stout
i
would
climb
over
a
nude
women
to
get
at
but
if
offered
another
i
would
drink
it
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
stuff
in
jamaica
and
it
couldnt
have
come
a
moment
too
soon
after
six
days
in
a
resort
where
their
idea
of
selection
was
wanbeer
redstripe
and
wanlitebeer
redstripe
lite
i
couldnt
take
it
anymore
this
beer
only
cost
me
a
quarter
it
was
plesently
cool
but
not
too
cold
sweet
to
the
taste
with
a
good
thick
consistancy
and
probably
a
decent
head
but
it
was
in
a
dark
bottle
well
worth
a
shot
if
your
stranded
on
an
island
saying
that
the
flavor
is
a
bit
simplistic
smooth
but
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
spice
grapey
and
medicinal
flavors
no
real
roastedness
and
not
bitter
enough
for
my
liking
which
is
a
shame
that
being
said
i
like
it
but
its
not
a
very
good
stout
but
a
decent
enough
beer
in
the
end
though
desnoes
geddes
dragon
stout
is
a
pretty
good
and
fairly
unique
beer
a
good
stout
thats
probably
a
great
compliment
to
a
sweet
dessert
theres
something
in
the
nose
and
to
a
much
lesser
extent
the
taste
thats
a
little
off
but
its
a
taste
that
grows
on
you
i
hated
my
first
i
think
i
may
hold
off
on
getting
any
more
for
a
while

this
beer
is
almost
a
cola
its
so
syrupy
still
manages
to
have
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
bite
yet
quite
malty
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
warm
and
smooth
it
is
intensely
sweet
with
loads
of
crystal
malts
along
with
a
slight
roasted
feel
it
has
a
pronounced
alcohol
taste
that
hits
you
up
front
then
fades
as
it
goes
down
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
interesting
beer
i
like
sweet
beers
you
need
only
pick
this
up
if
youre
stuck
in
jamaica

54the
smell
of
this
beer
was
like
caribbean
rum
and
the
beer
poured
a
black
color
with
a
lasting
tan
head
the
taste
was
very
sweet
and
very
thick
in
the
mouthfeel
a
nice
stout
dark
tan
head
that
holds
fairly
well
the
aroma
is
a
touch
roasty
and
somewhat
musty
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
the
body
is
much
thinner

for
the

it

i

this

on

coffee

rich

chocolate

smooth

slight

kicks
in

builds
kind
of
a
candy
chocolate
overall
flavor
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
either
for
being
a
local
bahamian
beer
its
a
standout
avoid
kalik
like
the
plague
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
acquire
it
back
home
overall
an
excellent
beer
if
i
could
find
this
nearby
id
buy
it
overall
i
was
surprised
it
was
actually
pretty
good
way
better
then
any
other
local
island
brews
i
have
had
it
doesnt
bring
anything
new
to
the
table
but
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
good
solid
stout
are
in
this
bottle
as
compared
to
the
other
drinks
there
this
beer
is
salvation
in
the
dessert
on
an
island
in
the
sea
omy
girlfriend
picked
this
one
up
for
me
on
a
recent
cruise
to
the
bahamas
and
it
was
really
a
pleasant
surprise
i
thought
the
taste
was
very
good
and
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
nice
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
especially
coming
from
the
caribbean
where
so
many
beers
are
wimpy
and
substandard
this
one
is
a
real
stout
with
some
characteristics
of
a
porter
the
color
is
very
black
with
a
modest
head
of
tan
slight
nose
of
dark
malts
and
hops
moderately
heavy
in
the
mouth
but
not
as
creamy
as
some
stouts
though
this
would
improve
if
poured
from
a
nitro
tap
nice
full
malt
on
the
palate
with
a
very
subtle
but
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
from
a
wellbalanced
hop
infusion
i
did
enjoy
this
and
consider
it
perhaps
the
best
brew
from
the
bahamas
o
the
beer
is
quite
flavorful
for
the
style
and
goes
down
quite
easily
pours
a
dark
brown
with
creamy
tan
two
finger
head
leaving
fair
amount
of
lacing
roasted
malt
with
hint
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
good
with
strong
finish
a
rather
nice
surprise
found
in
a
remote
beach
location
overall
a
tasty
stout
and
while
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
call
for
us
distribution
this
is
the
beer
to
have
in
the
bahamas
got
this
in
a
bottle
while
on
vacation
in
eleuthera
fresh
sweet
malty
i
think
of
stouts
as
a
good
coldweather
beer
but
this
is
a
stout
for
a
warm
climate
it
is
tasty
but
not
thick
which
makes
it
a
refreshing
choice
where
one
might
look
for
a
lager
went
to
the
freeport
and
tried
kalik
sands
and
this
kalik
was
skunky
and
looked
like
piss
in
a
bottle
tastes
much
lighter
than
the
7
though
sands
was
light
and
reminded
me
of
the
many
american
offerings
available
by
big
beer
this
beer
on
the
other
hand
was
dark
chocolate
with
a
good
solid
mouth
feel
not
a
guinness
fan
as
the
back
end
isnt
great
to
me
but
i
think
this
stout
tastes
much
smoother
and
has
the
rams
kick
in
abv
to
boot
as
shown
on
the
label
win
win
situation
one
of
the
smoother
stouts
ive
encountered
not
too
complex
of
a
taste
but
substantial
and
buzzy
with
a
nice
creamy
head
of
2
or
3
fingers
with
pretty
good
lacing
its
all
in
the
pour
not
overly
sweet
either
in
my
opinion
this
is
your
best
bet
in
the
bahamas
for
a
quality
beer
could
be
a
devastating
session
beer
if
youre
inclined
to
test
your
resistance
as
most
beer
on
the
islands
costs
the
same
i
would
definately
pick
this
up
stateside
and
add
to
my
arsenal
if
available
somewhat
similar
to
a
good
dark
bock
in
smoothness
with
a
nice
subtle
stout
flavor
with
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
undertones
brought
a
case
back
to
share
with
the
homies
since
i
was
so
impressed
on
what
i
stumbled
on
like
me
they
seek
beer
beyond
the
average
redneck
palate
i
received
all
positive
feedback
from
some
very
opinionated
friends
try
it
if
you
can
cheers
my
rating
here
is
based
in
comparision
to
all
beers
worldwide
but
if
it
were
based
on
the
island
beers
only
this
would
be
5
star
while
honeymooning
on
harbour
island
i
didnt
expect
to
have
a
great
beer
selection
since
the
island
is
about
3
miles
long
the
small
liquor
store
with
very
particular
hours
only
carried
a
slew
of
simple
lagers
and
this
local
stout
it
was
a
tasty
variant
when
i
popped
it
open
the
scent
was
a
thick
malty
chocolate
aroma
the
color
was
a
rich
dark
tone
with
little
carbonation
it
couldve
used
a
little
more
oomph
in
that
dept
as
it
was
inching
towards
flat
the
taste
was
gratifying
with
a
good
range
of
flavors
from
the
malty
chocolate
to
a
slight
spicebarley
flavor
bonus
points
for
a
cool
bottlecap
displaying
the
iconic
ram
served
to
me
in
a
plastic
mug
not
ideal
but
after
drinking
cans
of
sands
for
a
few
days
i
wont
complain
deep
black
with
a
thin
head
smells
of
rosted
chocolate
mix
with
a
faint
boozy
aroma
tastes
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
while
the
warmth
of
the
alcohol
coats
the
mouth
mild
hops
balance
out
the
brew
nicely
feels
pretty
dense
and
heavy
on
the
tongue
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
good
brew
thats
worth
a
try
if
your
in
the
islands
hv
o
really
good
the
first
thing
from
this
brewery
ive
enjoyed
pour
pitch
black
with
a
nice
tall
tan
head
aroma
is
coffee
roasted
nuts
and
trace
of
chocolat
taste
is
a
super
medium
sweetness
and
bitterness
full
body
creamy
and
average
carbonisation
long
sweet
bitter
and
coffee
finish
o
stunning
beer
full
of
flavour
slow
sipper
excellent
foreign
stout
bold
and
tasty
truly
balanced
with
just
enough
bells
and
whistles
to
be
great
no
pointless
exaggeration
i
would
not
change
one
thing
definitely
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
tasted
tasty
roasty
and
interesting
the
flavours
are
well
integrated
overall
making
it
seem
like
a
more
intentional
beer
despite
the
aggression
thats
present
it
all
still
seems
coherent
o
it
smelled
great
but
there
was
a
gross
bit
of
slime
i
do
not
believe
it
to
be
dregs
or
anything
related
to
bottle
conditioning
but
i
could
always
be
wrong
on
the
inside
of
the
bottle
cap
and
inside
the
lip
and
neck
of
the
bottle
there
was
some
normal
settlement
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
like
one
would
normally
expect
for
a
bottle
conditioned
export
stout
that
was
four
months
old
overall
a
very
good
stout
straightforward
nothing
unusual
just
very
high
quality
different
and
pleasant
good
depth
of
body
which
hid
the
alcohol
content
well
most
likely
the
best
kernel
ive
had
so
far
i
like
malty
brews
not
citrus
based
washing
up
liquid
type
golden
beers
a
bit
pricey
but
pick
up
this
beer
or
anything
from
the
kernel
its
a
treat
and
well
worth
it
o
if
only
this
was
indeed
exported
delicious
well
made
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
recently
foreignexport
stout
it
claims
to
be
and
it
sure
as
damn
well
is
very
nicely
done
and
a
joy
to
drink
overall
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
the
utmost
pleasure
of
tasting
ive
been
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
for
a
few
years
now
and
no
matter
what
the
price
i
always
try
to
get
another
case
of
24
before
the
one
i
currently
have
is
spent
its
one
of
those
beers
ill
always
be
faithful
to
falling
back
to
it
on
hard
days
when
i
feel
i
definitely
need
a
treat
for
myself
i
treasure
what
i
have
since
i
cant
have
it
regularly
nor
cheaply
this
is
some
seriously
awesome
beer
picked
this
up
at
the
kernel
brewery
while
on
vacation
in
london
pitch
black
pour
with
a
nice
two
finger
beige
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
earthy
and
roasty
with
lots
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
along
with
hints
of
leather
cocoa
and
nuts
the
taste
rich
and
flavorful
with
loads
of
roasty
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
along
with
hints
of
tobacco
cocoa
leather
and
some
subtle
dark
fruit
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
oily
and
slightly
chewy
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
than
i
had
expected
the
finish
is
dry
bitter
and
mouthcoating
overall
another
stellar
offering
from
the
kernel
black
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
on
the
glass
smell
is
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
grain
taste
is
mildly
bitter
and
heavy
on
the
coffee
with
a
dry
almost
piney
finish
feel
is
fairly
heavy
and
sticky
with
a
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
very
enjoyable
definitely
my
favorite
of
their
beers
so
far
and
one
of
the
best
export
stouts
ive
had
overall
sublime
a
perfect
addition
to
the
kernel
range
and
does
not
disappoint
imperial
brown
stout
may
have
a
slight
edge
over
this
in
taste
wise
but
this
is
as
close
as
youll
get
to
a
near
perfect
stout
find
it
drink
it
live
it
love
it
bottle
hivernale
poured
a
deep
black
color
stout
with
a
medium
size
foamy
head
aroma
of
nice
floral
coffee
notes
with
some
dark
chocolate
is
very
enticing
taste
is
dominated
by
some
very
nice
floral
coffee
notes
with
very
little
bitter
chocolate
and
almost
no
astringency
which
is
surprising
considering
the
amount
of
coffee
notes
that
are
discernable
light
smokey
notes
are
also
perceptible
though
dark
fruits
notes
are
not
really
detectable
as
per
brewers
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
with
no
apparent
alcohol
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
beer
and
definitely
makes
me
want
to
try
some
of
their
other
beers
impressive
a
fantastic
stout
like
running
into
a
wall
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavours
great
if
you
love
dark
beers
the
only
minor
complaint
i
have
is
that
the
mouthfeel
seemed
a
little
thin
to
match
the
flavour
a
more
unctuous
sensation
would
have
gone
down
well
trivialities
aside
this
is
excellent
and
should
be
consumed
if
you
have
the
opportunity
o
aroma
promises
more
than
flavour
delivers
nice
example
for
the
style
overall
good
but
fell
a
bit
short
of
a
great
stout
also
i
dont
see
the
potential
for
aging
so
of
youve
got
it
drink
it
fresh
overall
a
decent
stout
the
price
is
very
high
though
so
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
a
very
decent
export
stout
to
tease
your
taste
buds
hats
off
to
the
kernel
boys
once
again
overall
a
beautifully
balanced
stout
from
kernel
highly
recommended
overall
excellent
stuff
had
never
even
heard
of
this
brewery
before
the
2011
borefts
festival
at
de
molen
but
glad
i
decided
to
get
a
couple
of
bottles
to
bring
home
with
me
bold
full
flavored
and
very
enjoyable
stuff
well
worth
checking
out
if
you
get
the
chance
and
ill
be
looking
to
try
more
beers
from
this
brewery
recommended
overall
great
stout
easy
drinking
for
the
abv
and
moreish
with
the
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
balance
well
od
nice
stout
very
nice
stout
very
tasty
stuff
and
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
without
a
problem
i
would
seek
this
out
for
a
try
beer
is
oddly
smooth
with
a
dry
finish
and
a
lot
of
bitterness
the
beer
overall
is
quite
drinkable
but
a
little
thin
in
the
body
it
has
a
late
sweetness
that
is
a
little
odd
almost
a
tobacco
like
flavor
interesting
definitely
a
pleasurable
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
the
people
at
kernel
are
making
some
excellent
brews
md
pretty
soft
lightly
carbonated
and
the
palate
is
really
light
for
a
7
8abv
strong
stout
i
find
this
an
extremely
quaffable
and
wellmade
stout
though
theres
nothing
in
the
bottle
that
truly
hooks
my
palate
to
this
ale
d
very
nice
for
almost
8
a
balanced
export
stout
with
a
ton
of
flavor
worth
a
shot
o
very
nice
would
pair
well
with
a
chocolate
dessert
feel
fullbodied
and
a
little
on
the
chewythick
side
roasty
with
excellent
coffee
flavors
clear
through
to
the
linger
one
of
my
favorites
try
it
wasnt
much
like
a
stout
i
enjoyed
the
one
i
had
but
would
not
get
again
a
bland
stout
just
a
malty
beer
its
like
a
thin
roasted
vanilla
tobacco
beer
pretty
decent
too
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
is
smooth
at
times
as
it
has
a
nice
drinkable
feel
there
is
lots
here
with
a
nice
balanced
feel
that
just
adds
to
the
flavor
that
really
wows
overall
killer
stout
from
these
maine
canners
best
as
a
dessert
beer
id
say
but
not
overly
sweet
or
chocolatey
just
a
big
sturdy
tasty
stout
with
nice
accents
of
vanilla
and
cocoa
might
be
my
favorite
baxter
beer
not
a
bad
beer
true
to
the
style
i
guess
less
enjoyable
than
baxters
other
offerings
though
imho
good
stout
that
doesnt
standout
good
sipper
vanilla
and
cocoa
nibs
not
pronounced
coffee
and
hoppy
flavors
more
available
the
taste
is
also
vanilla
based
and
malt
forward
with
a
slight
bitterness
to
follow
this
is
all
over
the
map
but
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
it
overall
aptly
named
dark
stout
it
has
the
strong
chocolate
and
malt
flavors
of
some
big
beers
but
without
the
high
abv
got
this
in
a
trade
so
im
not
sure
about
the
cost
but
i
could
easily
drink
more
of
this
in
one
sitting
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
complexity
you
dont
expect
from
a
canned
beer
and
very
drinkable
maybe
my
scores
for
this
are
a
bit
high
due
to
the
heavy
stouts
ive
been
tasting
lately
but
i
really
liked
this
overall
an
average
to
above
average
export
stout
there
is
not
anything
bad
about
this
stout
but
not
much
jumps
out
to
me
either
that
said
it
was
a
good
sipper
that
i
had
a
coupe
of
during
a
snowy
football
watching
day
cheers
this
beer
is
named
after
the
1965
muhammad
ali
vs
sonny
liston
boxing
match
in
which
louisville
born
cassius
clay
knocked
liston
out
within
two
minutes
of
the
fights
beginning
link
appropriately
so
this
beer
looks
smells
and
tastes
so
good
but
man
if
you
drink
a
whole
6
pack
watch
out
cause
youll
get
knocked
out
like
liston
har
har
really
a
delicious
stout
no
matter
you
like
dry
stouts
or
sweet
ones
because
it
is
the
best
of
both
worlds
it
starts
out
dry
and
finishes
smooth
and
sweet
highly
recommended
poured
into
a
snifter
color
was
a
very
nick
dark
brown
that
was
completely
opaque
had
a
nice
creamy
rich
mocha
brown
head
that
left
a
solid
layer
with
a
little
bit
of
cling
a
fair
amount
of
sediment
was
floating
around
the
bottom
smell
was
nicely
sweet
lactose
with
a
touch
of
smoke
flavor
starts
with
some
roasty
biter
dark
chocolate
then
becomes
a
bit
more
bitter
a
bit
of
acid
that
balanced
out
as
it
sat
but
not
quite
as
mellow
as
i
would
expect
felt
great
in
the
mouth
coated
very
well
pretty
much
as
it
should
overall
the
lack
of
balanced
mellowness
and
what
seemed
to
be
excessive
sediment
took
it
down
a
notch
i
almost
always
gravitate
well
to
anything
dark
when
it
comes
to
beer
especially
anything
stoutrelated
but
i
keep
trying
these
export
stouts
and
i
just
cant
get
behind
them
not
sure
what
it
is
the
sweetness
fruitquality
i
dont
know
but
this
is
just
not
a
style
i
will
reach
for
often
ill
stick
with
the
more
roastedforward
stouts
overall
this
is
a
very
good
easy
drinking
chocolate
forward
stout
that
i
wish
was
made
more
readily
available
to
me
the
flavors
are
deep
and
rich
yet
this
stout
is
oddly
refreshing
really
solid
although
not
knock
your
socks
of
flavor
recommended
for
a
fairly
sessionable
full
flavored
stout
o
not
overly
complex
but
a
nice
tasting
stout
strong
chocolate
flavors
mixes
with
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
creat
a
nice
beer
6
310
12oz
can
black
with
a
smooth
and
creamy
looking
mocha
colored
head
this
stays
rich
and
frothy
with
some
thick
lacing
smells
of
roast
cocoa
vanilla
and
weird
hop
presence
that
i
guess
is
coming
off
like
a
kind
of
noble
hop
it
definitely
has
spiciness
to
it
the
taste
is
similar
but
does
seem
to
do
a
little
better
with
a
decent
balance
of
roasted
malts
a
sweet
combo
of
cocoa
and
vanilla
and
then
a
tingle
of
earthy
and
spicy
citric
hops
dry
and
bitter
on
the
finish
with
some
lingering
smoke
the
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
creaminess
in
the
mouth
that
flows
well
just
a
smidge
of
warmth
is
present
and
this
is
overall
pretty
smooth
this
was
decent
but
the
weirdness
of
the
aroma
kind
of
put
a
damper
on
things
id
maybe
check
a
can
out
of
this
but
it
really
isnt
worth
picking
up
multiples
of
the
most
is
medium
with
sharp
carbonation
overall
not
bad
nothing
special
though
o
this
is
awesome
kind
of
like
a
session
ris
flavors
of
a
big
stout
oatmeal
stout
without
the
super
boozyness
and
heavyness
right
up
there
with
ipswich
oatmeal
stout
as
my
favorite
stout
purchases
highly
recommended
absolutely
opaque
black
with
an
impressive
brown
head
that
settles
to
a
sturdy
top
layer
with
serious
lacing
looks
promising
the
aroma
delivers
a
nice
deep
chocolate
malt
with
hazelnut
coffee
and
some
vanilla
and
some
light
herbal
hop
edges
i
think
it
smells
terrific
the
first
taste
offers
a
bit
more
coffee
heavy
flavors
roasted
coffee
almost
burned
grounds
with
a
somewhat
sharp
edge
yet
the
mellow
deep
malt
holds
it
together
nicely
for
something
that
invites
the
big
gulp
approach
theres
some
subtle
seaweed
sort
of
grass
hop
in
the
background
that
makes
it
interesting
along
with
a
charcoal
finish
perhaps
more
notable
is
the
near
full
body
and
thick
silky
feel
accented
with
a
bit
of
fine
carbonation
sparkle
for
some
contrast
i
dont
know
this
seems
like
a
pretty
damn
good
stout
and
one
i
could
drink
a
few
of
easily
when
in
a
maltbomb
mood
its
interesting
without
being
especially
complex
and
delivers
the
nice
dark
punch
i
look
for
in
a
stout
im
quite
pleased
by
this
nice
stout
to
ride
shotgun
to
my
favorite
ipa
stowaway
nice
work
baxter
coffee
black
no
sugar
is
the
flavor
thin
for
an
oatmeal
stout
plenty
of
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
also
of
coffee
so
id
say
this
beer
is
a
bit
onedimensional
but
it
is
fully
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
stout
to
pound
down
for
a
while
overall
very
mixed
bag
the
oatmeal
stout
portion
with
vanilla
and
cocoa
nibs
was
very
nice
then
the
crazy
spicy
earthy
hops
comes
in
like
a
phantom
punch
oh
i
get
it
now
but
still
that
astringent
bitterness
with
quite
spicy
chewy
hops
dont
go
well
at
all
and
make
the
beer
more
like
an
american
black
ale
aka
black
ipa
which
i
dont
like
as
those
flavors
clash
so
much
although
the
mint
is
nice
the
rest
of
the
hop
flavors
dont
play
nice
at
all
on
the
palate
and
mouth
this
stuff
is
richly
coating
and
a
full
assault
missile
on
the
taste
buds
waves
of
chocolate
black
coffee
and
again
vanilla
thick
and
chewy
big
and
brash
not
for
the
weak
stout
lovers
go
get
some
on
a
side
note
i
like
the
packaging
of
the
can
with
all
of
the
places
to
take
a
canned
beer
around
the
rim
o
really
solid
stout
that
had
some
nice
complexities
carbonation
was
great
overall
a
lighter
stout
but
easy
to
drink
and
a
welcome
change
from
the
stronger
brews
of
this
style
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
opaque
blackish
color
with
a
deep
ruby
highlight
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
frothy
foamy
light
brown
head
that
starts
a
solid
inch
and
a
half
on
the
pour
but
settles
nicely
into
a
surface
coating
after
a
minute
or
two
loose
clingy
lacing
along
the
glass
as
you
drink
aromas
are
sweet
and
rich
with
a
vanilla
undertone
and
cocoa
nib
highlight
on
a
roasted
coffee
main
character
flavors
of
rich
and
bitter
roast
initially
with
a
touch
of
campfire
and
char
followed
by
the
darkly
bittersweet
cocoa
nib
the
vanilla
characteristics
only
peak
their
head
out
here
and
there
in
an
attempt
to
lighten
the
heavy
bitter
and
roast
characteristics
only
to
be
slightly
overpowered
rich
roasty
and
bitter
aftertaste
with
the
cocoa
lingering
on
a
bit
through
the
slick
clean
and
slightly
dry
finish
very
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
the
abv
helpss
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
the
heavy
flavors
surprisingly
do
not
build
on
your
palate
leaving
you
a
reprieve
between
each
sip
to
recover
and
prepare
for
the
next
tasty
stout
odbaxter
is
a
very
intriguing
brewery
i
absolutely
love
being
able
to
grab
a
stout
in
a
can
that
doesnt
cost
15
for
a
four
pack
this
is
a
feisty
beer
finely
crafted
its
pretty
awesome
actually
with
your
purchase
of
10
you
are
rewarded
with
a
big
bad
brawny
posse
of
six
dark
troublemakers
hey
baxter
you
just
bought
yourself
a
seat
at
the
cool
kids
table
with
this
beer
notes
very
drinkable
and
something
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
cold
night
this
one
will
warm
you
up
very
well
cheers
o
had
high
hopes
for
this
stout
in
a
can
made
with
vanilla
beans
and
cocoa
nibs
sign
me
up
a
little
bit
lacking
in
execution
however
heavy
on
burnt
flavors
and
missing
or
just
overpowered
the
complexity
and
nuances
that
i
was
looking
for
and
hoping
to
find
here
overall
just
an
average
offering
for
the
style
not
terrible
but
wont
send
me
out
looking
for
more
either
overall
this
is
just
a
ridiculously
delicious
stout
with
great
roasted
and
coffee
character
it
feels
creamy
up
front
but
has
a
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
hop
bitterness
one
of
the
best
localtome
stouts
and
has
become
a
winter
staple
this
season
oa
the
tops
of
the
baxter
line
i
need
to
check
these
out
packaged
cans
great
offering
o
a
beer
for
malt
lovers
and
fans
of
this
particular
style
i
am
one
of
those
people
and
appreciate
when
a
brewery
can
offer
a
beer
like
this
and
nail
it
on
the
head
in
my
opinion
baxter
has
a
very
accurate
representation
of
the
style
well
done
o
its
pretty
good
a
little
bit
of
everything
with
this
one
some
smoke
a
bit
of
char
cocoa
and
vanilla
overall
a
tasty
stout
with
awesome
artwork
on
the
can
o
pretty
tasty
but
the
roasted
malt
is
a
bit
harsh
pours
a
solid
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
good
sized
tan
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
cap
smells
of
chocolate
coffee
vanilla
and
roast
with
hint
of
dark
sugar
and
ash
this
has
a
light
earthy
hop
aroma
the
malt
aromas
in
this
are
huge
for
the
style
the
flavor
is
bitter
roast
and
earthy
hop
with
bits
of
chocolate
and
caramel
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
ash
and
smoke
medium
to
thick
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
roasty
mouthfeel
i
was
surprised
by
this
one
its
really
quite
good
the
vanilla
is
subtle
but
it
adds
to
the
chocolate
effect
quite
nicely
the
bottom
end
of
the
top
tier
of
chocolate
stouts
imo
sweet
can
art
o
pretty
decent
stout
with
a
nice
touch
of
extra
complexity
from
the
cocoa
and
vanilla
creamy
with
nice
drinkability
a
little
bit
more
vanilla
would
have
balanced
out
the
bitter
roasty
flavors
better
and
made
this
really
good
imo
solid
stout
with
a
very
big
and
nice
cocoa
presence
something
like
a
nice
cocoa
powder
for
baking
vanilla
shows
up
as
well
as
the
rest
of
stout
flavors
to
round
it
all
out
and
make
this
one
hard
to
put
down
between
sips
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
i
dont
buy
too
many
six
packs
of
stouts
preferring
to
get
a
single
22
oz
bottle
to
enjoy
over
an
evening
but
i
am
glad
i
bought
this
beer
its
nice
to
have
a
local
seasonal
stout
i
may
not
get
more
of
this
beer
this
season
but
i
can
see
myself
getting
some
next
year
if
youre
in
this
area
you
probably
wont
be
disappointed
with
this
brew
if
youre
looking
for
a
local
andor
seasonal
stout
o
a
solid
foreignstyle
stout
with
a
great
chocolate
and
vanilla
profile
doesnt
overbear
or
get
too
sweet
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
given
the
6
8
worth
a
try
this
season
overall
not
too
bad
has
some
great
qualities
drinkable
and
certainly
doesnt
feel
big
at
6
8
well
hidden
this
is
the
first
baxter
beer
that
ive
ever
had
im
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
good
it
is
i
could
make
this
a
winter
regular
for
me
i
really
like
the
packaging
too
cool
blue
can
with
red
accents
o
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
very
enjoyable
id
reccomwns
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
stout
overall
this
is
a
great
tasting
stout
for
a
cold
winters
night
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
plenty
of
lacing
once
the
head
dissipates
smell
is
not
too
strong
but
you
get
whiff
of
roasted
malts
chocolate
and
espresso
the
taste
consists
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
slight
metallic
taste
probably
from
the
can
medium
body
with
some
carbonation
sticky
on
the
lips
too
a
decent
local
stout
but
i
think
it
could
be
a
lot
better
poured
from
the
can
into
a
pint
glass
pours
black
with
a
thick
deep
tan
head
crowned
by
a
light
tan
center
head
lingers
and
becomes
quite
fluffy
the
chocolate
aroma
hits
first
followed
by
a
roasty
malt
vanilla
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
dry
roasty
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
finish
a
thin
body
that
leaves
you
wanting
to
take
another
sip
very
nice
decent
stout
but
nothing
that
is
out
of
the
ordinary
would
like
to
try
draft
but
this
is
well
worth
it
for
the
price
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
off
white
head
layers
of
lace
are
left
aroma
of
smoke
and
roasted
malts
in
the
flavor
robust
roasted
malt
flavor
of
dark
coffee
with
hazelnut
cream
roasted
black
patent
malt
flavor
is
primary
there
is
a
mild
resinous
hop
note
and
all
due
bitterness
full
bodied
well
carbonated
and
delicately
smooth
overall
this
is
a
tasty
stout
a
bit
stronger
than
your
typical
solid
stout
here
32oz
growler
from
whole
foods
pours
a
black
color
with
ruby
hues
and
an
inch
of
light
brown
head
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
earthy
with
some
chocolate
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
and
hints
of
caramel
and
vanilla
tastes
much
like
the
aroma
earthy
at
first
with
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
hints
of
smoke
with
some
sweetness
towards
the
finish
some
sour
notes
mild
alcohol
presence
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
thin
overall
pretty
solid
example
of
the
style
id
grab
again
decent
but
for
some
reason
i
expected
more
they
could
consider
using
this
recipe
to
make
an
imperial
stout
its
solid
and
would
work
well
good
effort
otherwise
overall
ok
but
nothing
special
didnt
have
a
lot
going
for
it
fairly
bland
not
a
lot
of
great
stout
characters
either
a
nononsense
nofrills
stout
from
three
heads
nothing
crazy
but
still
very
tasty
o
not
my
favorite
stout
ive
had
quite
hoppy
as
far
as
stouts
go
it
just
misses
the
mark
for
me
o
this
is
one
hoppy
stout
no
question
about
that
youd
think
that
this
would
be
easy
to
drink
at
7
but
the
hops
have
something
to
say
about
that
and
make
it
more
of
a
sipper
some
nice
flavors
going
on
underneath
the
hops
make
up
for
the
astringency
and
make
this
a
solid
fes
nice
enough
beer
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
char
on
the
nose
and
in
the
aftertaste
the
nose
really
warmed
up
by
the
end
giving
a
nice
roasty
quality
to
an
otherwise
strong
base
of
aromatics
the
flavoring
however
fell
short
while
there
were
notes
here
and
there
of
what
we
wanted
the
only
part
where
flavor
felt
stark
enough
to
wake
you
up
was
in
the
end
and
aftertaste
otherwise
the
beer
was
relatively
washed
out
and
watery
and
we
found
ourselves
not
wanting
much
more
than
one
serving
we
have
certainly
come
to
expect
more
from
this
prominent
local
brewery
o
very
hopped
up
export
stout
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
less
bitterness
but
the
nose
and
flavour
profiles
are
otherwise
on
point
nice
body
too
can
from
trade
thanks
pours
pitch
black
with
a
pretty
creamy
looking
one
finger
dark
khaki
head
aroma
of
coffee
roasted
malts
some
sweet
molasses
a
hint
of
hops
flavor
follows
with
a
nutty
note
some
roasted
coffee
roasted
malts
sweet
molasses
and
lightly
bitter
chocolate
nice
balance
of
the
sweet
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
super
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
o
thick
and
creamy
with
plenty
of
char
would
be
outstanding
with
bbq
meats
smooth
and
roasty
with
coffee
notes
overall
this
is
incredibly
well
balanced
with
the
chocolate
being
perfectly
sweet
and
the
malt
adding
just
a
touch
of
needed
bitterness
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
and
definitely
worth
seeking
out
this
stout
is
legit
and
true
to
style
reminds
me
of
western
european
stouts
ive
had
noice
had
at
brewery
on
cask
5
stars
well
deserved
notes
a
fine
very
drinkable
stout
this
is
a
big
strong
bitter
but
pretty
traditional
stout
it
would
be
a
great
option
for
a
daily
drinker
kind
of
stout
think
a
much
bigger
bolder
and
better
guinness
its
not
super
sweet
so
its
not
much
of
a
dessert
stout
o
this
one
definitely
is
a
meal
in
a
glass
huge
creamy
mouthfeel
with
nice
smokychocolaty
roasted
notes
well
done
huge
stout
here
perfect
for
winter
grain
from
caramel
to
coffee
and
bakers
chocolate
roasty
and
toasty
with
a
denice
palate
encompassing
expansive
feel
and
a
touch
of
out
sweetness
in
there
too
the
abv
is
right
on
as
well
any
bigger
it
would
be
hot
and
slow
but
as
it
is
it
drinks
easy
despite
being
huge
its
a
great
cold
weather
four
pack
and
is
just
filling
enough
to
be
warming
but
is
almost
refreshing
when
cold
these
guys
might
be
one
of
the
best
unsung
breweries
in
the
country
this
is
good
as
their
hoppy
stuff
which
is
insanely
good
nothing
but
excellence
from
these
guys
in
my
experience
so
far
a
very
distinct
and
well
built
stout
yummy

a
very
dark
grains
bring
on
a
super
dark
chocolate
feel
that
brings
along
a
substantial
bitterness
drinks
perhaps
a
bit
bigger
than
7
5
but
still
flavorful
and
nice
as
a
tallboy
overall
kinda
reminds
me
of
big
bold
imperial
stouts
like
old
rasputin
expedition
ten
fidy
lighter
in
alcohol
but
almost
equal
in
denseintense
roastdark
chocolate
definitely
not
an
everyday
stout
but
if
you
dig
this
kinda
thing
its
sure
to
please
this
is
excellent
thanks
to
my
friend
for
treating
to
one
of
these
i
am
headed
down
south
to
ruidoso
next
week
and
will
be
picking
up
a
4pack
of
this
for
the
camping
trip
well
done
la
cumbre
overall
a
very
tasty
stout
and
one
i
was
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
try
o
a
nice
stout
with
good
flavors
and
rich
taste
this
pours
a
roasty
black
in
color
with
tight
foam
lacing
atop
it
has
a
great
roast
aroma
full
of
dark
chocolate
cocoa
nibs
on
my
first
sniff
i
picked
up
layers
of
roast
toffee
toast
and
roastiness
but
after
tasting
the
flavor
comes
across
on
my
palate
muting
the
complexity
i
found
in
the
aroma
dont
get
me
wrong
its
just
the
nuances
i
detected
while
inhaling
are
now
nuances
i
find
on
the
palate
lots
of
roast
lots
of
toast
and
a
wonderful
dark
coffeedark
chocolate
flavoring
it
finishes
dry
and
goes
down
smoothly
not
a
hoppy
stout
but
there
is
a
pronounced
bitterness
giving
it
definition
thinner
bodied
than
i
tend
to
prefer
but
utterly
tasty
nonetheless
ƭίcƙ
overall
this
beer
was
good
but
nothing
extraordinary
it
drinks
easily
its
been
in
my
closet
for
at
least
a
year
so
that
may
be
the
cause
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
seeing
as
its
from
massachusetts
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
procure
it
glad
to
receive
it
in
a
trade
though
o
interesting
fes
lots
of
char
and
chocolate
and
super
dry
the
aftertaste
is
practically
like
eating
cocoa
powder
one
of
the
driest
stouts
ive
ever
had
overall
the
flavors
are
decent
but
the
dryness
is
kinda
offputting
o
this
is
an
interesting
though
fairly
big
foreignexport
stout
which
significant
amounts
of
roast
and
char
flavorsaromas
the
hoppiness
really
starts
to
become
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
up
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
nice
and
dry
burnt
and
roasty
captain
swains
is
good
on
its
own
with
deep
conversation
or
a
juicy
ribeye
thick

up

and
coffee
and
lots
of
roast

the
finish

stout
review
shocking
this
was
pretty
kickass
they
made
naturally
contradicting
flavors
come
together
quite
well
this
brew
deserves
more
publicity
i
got
it
for
5
99
per
22
oz
and
i
find
that
to
be
a
decent
exchange
far
hoppier
than
anticipated
one
of
my
favorite
cisco
brews

a

there
too
a

a

finish
and

medium

and

would

on
a

bomber
is
a
bit
much
for
one
person
nicer
to
share
id
imagine
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
rubybrown
color
with
a
light
brown
thin
head
the
nose
is
roasted
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
a
slight
hops
presence
that
all
blends
together
into
an
intoxicating
dark
aroma
roasted
palate
with
bitter
coffee
highlights
and
cocoa
nib
characteristics
the
aftertaste
is
smokey
and
roasted
with
a
smooth
bitter
finish
great
lacing
on
the
glass
as
you
go
making
this
an
allaround
great
drinker
o
have
not
had
too
much
from
this
brewer
but
am
always
down
to
try
and
extra
stout
bomber
for
4
not
bvery
disappointing
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
stout
plus
a
few
extra
ingredients
i
give
it
a
solid
thumb
up
ive
enjoyed
capt
swains
for
years
and
realized
only
today
that
id
never
reviewed
it
incidentally
this
makes
a
great
black
and
tan
if
you
have
a
bottle
of
whale
tail
pale
handy
strong
smoky
aroma
has
firm
notes
of
molasses
caramel
and
quality
coffee
it
pours
a
rich
warm
opaque
sable
with
a
thick
finebubbled
light
tan
head
rich
flavor
has
molasses
roast
coffee
caramel
and
charred
wood
notes
plus
a
hint
of
semisweet
chocolate
fullbodied
texture
has
a
good
amount
of
fizz
and
leaves
a
nice
smoky
tingle
taste
is
a
smooth
malty
bomb
with
some
interesting
smoke
notes
and
piney
resin
hint
of
chocolate
lasting
dryness
from
the
hops
not
as
complex
as
i
hoped
but
a
very
good
stout
unusual
well
done
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
expiration
or
bottling
date
listed
sampled
on
february
6
2012
it
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
a
khakibrown
head
that
fluffs
up
and
lingers
for
an
extended
amount
of
time
the
aroma
is
vibrant
and
complex
with
dark
malts
and
dark
fruit
accompanied
by
a
pungent
earthy
or
pine
hopped
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
to
bold
the
taste
begins
with
the
malty
character
but
is
then
broken
up
by
a
powerful
hoppy
bite
that
ends
dry
this
is
unlike
other
stouts
i
have
had
smells
great
tastes
hoppier
than
expected
very
nice
and
a
surprise
buy
for
me
ill
definitely
get
more
chinook
hops
are
so
perfect
in
their
way
that
they
seem
to
epitomize
the
very
scent
and
charm
and
must
of
the
forest
its
as
if
the
old
woods
daintiest
thought
had
materialized
in
this
foreign
stout
the
hops
notwithstanding
this
even
has
strong
wine
and
cigarlike
qualities
it
is
an
unusual
characterful
and
curious
drink
m
smooth
delicious
flavors
and
wellbalanced
huge
fan
of
this
beer
first
stout
that
ive
poured
with
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
as
well
incredibly
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
will
definitely
drink
this
again
d
having
never
heard
of
this
brewery
before
picking
this
beer
up
on
a
whim
i
didnt
necessarily
expect
much
but
i
was
blown
away
by
the
first
sip
the
aroma
is
absolutely
spectacular
and
the
flavor
profile
backs
it
up
with
a
dark
complexity
that
holds
up
well
against
the
best
of
the
style
really
nice
and
at
less
than
6
for
a
bomber
it
is
a
good
value
too
if
i
could
get
this
at
home
i
would
buy
a
few
to
cellar
as
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
only
improve
with
time
d
an
interesting
two
faced
stout
the
nose
is
sweet
and
rich
the
palette
is
roasted
and
charred
to
a
maximum
with
only
a
touch
of
sweetness
interesting
and
surprising
a
solid
brew
all
the
way
around
o
overall
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
foreign
extra
stouts
ive
had
personally
i
find
it
better
than
the
guinness
foreign
extra
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
ends
with
a
bite
it
aint
sweet
nice
to
have
this
one
overall
its
a
fine
stout
i
think
theres
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
still
im
certain
ill
buy
another
bottle
o
a
good
stout
odecent
beer
subtle
smoke
and
lots
of
maltiness
would
like
to
try
more
from
this
place
pretty
nice
stout
would
drink
this
again
this
beer
pours
a
dad
brown
to
black
color
with
a
good
sized
tan
head
the
smell
is
roasty
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
there
is
also
a
good
hop
presence
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
good
hop
and
roasty
bitterness
and
a
wonderful
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
little
sweetness
to
it
bthe
carbonation
is
medium
and
overall
this
is
a
pretty
damn
good
beer
i
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
its
enjoable
but
not
entirely
balanced
the
body
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
the
carbonation
is
good
and
somewhat
soft
not
bad
here
kind
of
underwhelming
enjoyable
nevertheless
d
would
love
to
drink
this
again
the
thin
mouthfeel
of
this
as
opposed
to
a
thicker
imperial
stout
is
refreshing
and
i
wish
more
brewers
would
experiment
with
this
style
been
saving
this
one
for
a
while
now
pitch
black
opaque
beer
light
brown
head
thats
holding
nicely
and
clinging
to
the
glass
looks
good
smells
ultra
chocolaty
with
a
hint
of
booze
in
the
aroma
smooth
in
terms
of
booziness
but
it
is
very
acidic
on
the
tongue
nice
bread
flavors
toast
mixed
with
intense
dark
chocolate
flavors
build
up
and
finger
for
a
while
the
smokiness
comes
off
more
like
an
ashy
flavor
im
not
really
into
it
strong
and
very
dark
beer
probably
should
have
busted
this
one
out
in
the
winter
decent
enough
stout
that
ill
be
happy
to
quaff
but
nothing
distinctive
about
it
the
smokeroastharsh
combo
just
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
d
a
decent
stout
with
an
overpowering
hop
bite
that
doesnt
really
fit
in
my
opinion
very
dark
basically
black
with
a
fine
cap
of
brown
bubbles
good
head
retention
thick
and
clumpy
lacing
smells
malty
caramel
and
a
little
toffee
roast
with
grassy
hops
nutty

with

i
was
impressed
by
this
one
definitely
a
hoppy
stout
worthy
of
rough
seas
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
stout
and
a
great
effort
poured

all
of
this
so
far
would
have
landed
it

the

moved
it
across

its
a

that

it

i

on

this
has

nothing
wowed
me
the
taste
was
rich
stout
with
a
distinct
pine
on
the
back
end
very
intriguing
and
i
wonder
what
varieties
of
hops
were
used
in
this
beer
overall
this
beer
was
a
very
good
value
for
the
money
this
is
an
above
average
effort
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
well
it
fit
the
bill
it
had
a
robust
aroma
and
taste
and
looked
the
part
where
it
actually
stood
apart
was
in
the
feel
where
it
was
overly
smooth
and
soft
drinking
this
beer
with
its
name
label
and
ridiculous
thirteen
malts
has
a
darkly
ominous
tone
to
which
it
does
not
disappoint
drinkabilty
is
meh
pretty
bitter
and
stouty
little
salty
fairly
dry
bit
of
burnt
coffee
grinds
notes
excellent
my
personal
favorite
within
its
style
as
of
right
now
a
big
bold
beer
very
smokey
and
even
more
so
as
it
warms
this
might
be
a
little
overwhelming
to
some
but
it
definitely
tickled
my
fancy
why
dont
more
american
breweries
produce
foreignexport
stouts
and
extra
stouts
d
a
great
beer
for
a
cold
night
like
the
one
im
experiencing
right
now
found
it
similar
to
guinness
foreign
stout
which
is
one
of
my
gotos
so
much
flavor
in
this
one
i
truly
had
a
lot
of
difficulty
putting
it
down
a
really
nice
effort
and
well
worth
trying
if
not
regularly
drinking
d
very
welldone
way
more
than
i
was
expecting
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
chocolate
with
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
some
alcohol
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
thanks

pretty

definitely
does

8

more
like

this
is
a
fine
extra
stout
with
excellent
character
the
generous

and
roasted
qualities
are
quite
tasty
but
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
treat
for
any
stout

d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty

i
was

it
was

i
would
have
guessed
more
like
5
to
6
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
again

thanks
russ
delicious
a
bold
but
amazingly
drinkable
stout
love
it
if
i
wasnt
going
the
malty
barleywine
route
id
head
up
this
non
ris
type
stout
drinkability
is
good
the
prominent
hopping
and
lack
of
sweetness
makes
this
one
more
an
american
stout
than
a
foreign
export
stout
bold
and
delicious
pours
black
with
a
slightly
more
than
a
film
head
smells
of
dark
fruits
coffee
roasted
malt
and
booze
more
than
i
would
have
thought
for
8
tastes
much
of
the
same
but
with
a
very
bitter
bite
right
up
front
that
was
not
one
of
those
pleasant
bitter
bites
the
fruit
came
back
towards
the
end
but
not
enough
to
balance
this
out
medium
to
heavey
bodied
and
not
very
drinkable
at
all
in
my
opinion
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
about
an
inch
frothy
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
this
must
be
a
fresh
bottle
because
the
first
thing
i
can
smell
in
this
brew
after
pouring
it
into
the
glass
is
pine
hops
theres
also
roasted
malt
chocolate
coffee
and
dark
fruit
in
the
aroma
once
the
beer
has
been
in
the
glass
a
little
while
the
malty
aromas
get
stronger
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
with
the
addition
of
some
burntcharred
malt
and
a
bit
of
caramel
the
malty
flavors
come
out
stronger
in
the
taste
but
the
hops
are
still
pretty
noticable
this
is
one
of
the
hoppier
stouts
ive
had
recently
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
a
bit
creamy
and
velvety
drinkability
is
very
good
its
smooth
tasty
and
just
plain
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
overall
brew
the
next
time
i
head
to
the
east
coast
ill
have
to
buy
this
again
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
tried
from
cisco
brewers
and
it
hopefully
wont
be
the
last
hopefully
swains
descendants
are
leaving
the
whales
alone
these
days
see
bottle
label
i
really
like
the
soothing
full
body
of
this
beer
and
how
it
carries
the
brooding
smoked
peat
character
it
made
me
want
to
grow
a
beard
and
put
on
a
sweater
at
only
6
bucks
for
a
big
bottle
this
is
a
steal
for
any
stoutipa
lovers
i
just
wish
i
would
have
waited
for
my
sarah
on
this
one
shes
gonna
love
it
d
one
would
be
okay
but
my
dislike
of
hop
flavor
would
keep
me
from
having
a
second
d
its
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
quite
enjoyable
this
poured
an
opaque
pitch
black
with
moderate
tan
head
it
smelled
like
orange
with
some
milk
chocolate
and
floral
hops
and
a
bit
of
coffee
it
tasted
like
orange
and
floral
hops
with
some
milk
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
very
hoppy
for
a
stout
reminding
me
much
more
of
a
black
ipa
it
still
had
a
clean
and
fairly
enjoyable
flavor
with
decent
body
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
too
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
beer
was
nice
and
interesting
and
i
would
recommend
trying
it
once
just
dont
expect
anything
amazing
flavor
is
good
but
nothing
special
creamy
smooth
and
medium
body
carbonation
is
pretty
average
picking
up
a
ton
of
roasted
coffee
and
semisweet
chocolate
the
hops
really
take
over
the
last
wave
of
flavor
but
not
overkill
bitterness
finally
the
beer
ends
with
a
decent
aftertaste
of
coffee
overall
a
pretty
decent
stout
taste
is
rich
malty
and
chocolaty
with
a
bevy
of
dark
fruits
and
a
slightly
acridic
taste
in
there
as
well
slight
hop
bite
midway
through
leaves
a
long
lingering
roast
bitterness
in
the
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
high
level
of
carbonation
im
not
sure
if
there
are
some
wild
yeasts
in
here
or
if
its
supposed
to
taste
this
way
the
belgian
character
is
subtle
but
its
strong
enough
to
notice
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
its
an
ok
brew
as
is
but
i
think
it
could
be
so
much
better
if
i
dare
resample
this
one
i
will
rereview
d
very
drinkable
stout
loved
how
the
flavors
blended
on
this
one
d
this
brew
packs
a
punch
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
less
than
halfway
through
my
glass
i
can
feel
its
effects
beginning
to
kick
in
for
a
session
occasion
pass
her
by
for
a
special
strong
stout
though
this
ones
hard
to
top
food
devils
food
cake
or
some
good
seared
scallops
or
oysters
drinkability
the
acidity
is
the
only
thing
holding
this
one
back
for
me
very
tasty
drinkable
stout
well
done
thick
and
rich
body
just
a
small
raspy
wood
finish
to
minimally
distract
from
an
overall
impressive
brew
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
poured
with
a
thick
froathy
3
finger
light
brown
head
the
head
mostly
dissapeared
but
left
a
small
layer
and
clung
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
very
well
aroma
was
slightly
bitter
finished
as
a
brown
sweet
sugar
smell
taste
was
strongly
of
chocolate
a
bit
bitter
like
a
dark
chocolate
nicely
creamy
coated
inside
the
mouth
very
well
great
consistency
with
a
balanced
amount
of
carbonation
abv
hit
a
touch
hard
but
was
a
very
pleasant
drink
the
taste
is
very
assertive
first
off
this
is
a
thick
full
bodied
full
palated
creamy
stout
it
has
a
nice
charred
brown
sugar
taste
lots
of
chocolate
and
dark
malts
a
nice
hoppy
presence
and
some
mocha
tastes
as
well
there
is
just
a
ton
of
malt
in
the
beer
and
it
is
well
balanced
with
leafy
hop
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
oily
and
the
aftertaste
lingers
a
bit
but
this
is
just
a
very
warming
very
assertive
creamy
and
rich
stout
that
hits
lots
of
high
notes
d
pretty
good
it
took
me
just
over
an
hour
to
drink
the
bomber
while
watching
the
yankees
beat
the
angels
in
game
six
of
the
alcs
not
bad
not
quite
an
imperial
stout
but
sure
has
more
of
a
kick
than
a
dry
stout
worth
a
try
at
least
once
but
only
if
you
can
get
past
the
carbonation
overall
impression
a
harsh
stout
not
for
the
faint
of
palate
like
standing
too
close
to
a
stage
speaker
at
a
concert
with
poor
accoustics
captain
swain
dishes
out
a
deafening
roar
of
roast
its
a
youngtasting
garage
band
of
a
beer
raw
and
untamed
it
could
benefit
from
some
alcohol
and
body
roasted
nearburnt
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
hit
the
palate
and
coat
the
sides
of
the
tongue
with
an
acrid
bitterness
smoke
and
earthen
hops
follow
while
lasting
notes
of
charred
earth
linger
long
into
the
finish
sadly
this
is
a
bit
too
onedimensional
for
me
and
i
find
myself
missing
the
complexities
picked
up
in
the
aroma
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
and
watery
for
a
stout
more
porterlike
in
its
consistency
burps
are
tasting
like
bandaids
gross
pretty
good
drinkability
though
not
too
heavy
and
goes
down
smoothly
although
a
bomber
might
give
me
some
trouble
still
an
interesting
beer
at
any
rate
a
very
good
stout
and
i
feel
this
one
is
a
good
example
of
the
export
stout
style
roasty
and
heavy
without
being
to
the
level
of
an
ris
increasing
the
drinkability
a
bit
recommended
d
a
great
stout
d
notes
roasted
and
dry
too
much
so
notes
from
3707
pours
deep
black
with
a
nice
thick
head
definitely
decant
this
because
there
is
a
lot
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
i
made
that
mistake
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
the
aroma
has
some
chocolate
and
a
little
french
roast
but
overall
is
not
as
strong
as
i
wouldve
liked
the
taste
is
of
bakers
chocolate
slightly
bitter
and
some
hops
linger
there
is
also
some
astringency
from
the
alcohol
the
body
is
full
and
beautiful
and
this
is
a
decently
drinkable
imperial
stout
this
growler
came
from
the
brewery
on
nantucket
and
was
served
at
about
forty
degrees
pour
was
in
to
a
chalice
style
glass
color
was
pitch
black
with
a
sizable
tan
heading
which
is
very
characteristic
of
encounters
with
this
beer
in
the
past
but
more
controlled
meaning
i
did
not
have
to
wait
15
minutes
for
the
massive
heading
to
die
down
smell
reveals
roasted
coffee
bean
hints
of
marshmallow
more
hints
of
blackberry
intermingling
of
dark
and
milk
chocolates
as
well
taste
is
very
complex
loads
of
bitter
coffee
flavors
come
through
as
well
as
an
ample
earth
bound
taste
that
takes
some
time
to
get
used
to
more
evidence
of
dark
bitter
chocolate
builds
as
it
glides
around
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
fairly
medium
when
considering
the
strength
of
its
alcohol
certainly
packed
with
flavor
from
all
the
bitter
coffee
and
earth
tones
drinkability
suffers
only
a
little
bit
because
is
takes
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
this
is
my
second
glass
tonight
and
i
cannot
see
myself
going
back
to
it
until
mmmm
probably
tomorrow
night
overall
this
in
my
eyes
is
one
of
the
most
unique
stouts
and
possibly
beers
that
new
england
has
to
offer
it
is
a
shame
that
you
rarely
see
brews
from
cisco
on
tap
apart
from
their
whales
tale
pale
ale
even
though
that
is
another
good
beer
one
to
seek
out
for
sure
and
if
you
are
on
the
island
get
a
growler
as
it
is
much
better
than
out
of
the
bottle
cheers
d
this
is
a
likable
drinkable
beer
with
a
good
personality
and
character
decent
effort
from
cisco
a
little
thin
but
after
a
slow
start
it
finishes
solidly
this
is
mouthcoating
but
very
drinkable
finish
is
a
bit
molassescoffeehoppy
but
quite
pleasant
overall
a
real
drinker
another
great
one
from
cisco
this
stuff
is
hit
or
miss
to
find
so
if
you
see
it
grab
one
prosit
mk
thanks
corey
pours
black
with
brown
highlights
when
held
up

massive
foamy
lightbrown
head
decent
lacing
what
is
it
with
cisco
and
these
gargantuan
heads
its
crazy
but
i
guess
its
part
of
their
charm
initial
smell
is
hoppy
really
hoppy
theres
some
roasted
coffee
bean
and
chocolate
smells
in
there
too
but
the
hoppiness
is
surprising
really
excellent
coffee
taste
some
bitter
chocolate
the
hops
come
through
as
well
which
is
interesting
high
level
of
carbonation
makes
this
seem
oddly
refreshing
for
a
stout
while
it
does
maintain
a
decent
amount
of
chewiness
great
lingering
coffee
bitterness
its
another
great
beer
from
cisco
i
would
wait
a
year
a
try
again
just
to
see
what
happens
when
the
hop
aroma
fades
nice
drinking
beer
good
taste
amazing
head
retention
but
overcarbonated
and
not
as
fullstrongextra
as
i
want
to
see
d
good
brew
and
worthy
of
a
try
a
little
high
on
the
alcohol
in
the
long
run
sessionwise
drinkability
what
a
great
foreignexport
stout
this
was
i
enjoyed
my
time
drinking
this
one
its
dark
full
flavored
and
full
bodied
like
a
stout
should
be
if
only
they
would
increase
the
roasted
flavors
in
the
taste
a
bit
but
i
know
i
cant
have
everything
that
doesnt
matter
because
i
would
be
pleased
to
drink
this
one
again
in
the
near
future
a
friend
brought
this
to
a
tasting
and
im
glad
he
did
pours
a
black
body
with
a
red
hue
and
a
nice
thick
rich
tan
head
the
interesting
aroma
seems
to
be
comprised
of
roasted
malts
some
chocolate
and
some
sourdough
a
thin
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
but
its
good
lots
of
coffee
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
in
the
flavors
also
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
kick
to
it
which
made
it
that
much
better
overall
a
well
crafted
beer
with
an
impressive
supposed
13
different
malts
i
was
hoping
for
something
sweeter
with
less
astringent
citrus
flavors
however
it
just
tastes
like
the
yeast
was
a
little
stressed
to
me
i
never
find
those
citrus
tastes
in
stouts
very
pleasant
had
on
tap
at
union
brewhouse
just
tapped
pured
an
opaque
black
with
huge
creamy
tan
head
impressive
floral
hop
smell
for
a
stout
some
coffee
or
toffe
in
the
nose
also
first
sip
wow
strong
i
get
a
huge
bitter
hit
some
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
but
hgue
hop
afterburn
as
i
drink
it
is
still
strong
does
not
mellow
as
i
go
good
full
flavor
with
a
medium
body
i
have
to
stop
after
one
of
these
poured
into
a
heavy
glass
chalice
formed

above
the
opaque
dark
brownblack
brew
head
holds
well
with
a
thick
slowfalling
layer
of
frothy
lace
aroma
is
hearty
dark
grains
coupled
with
ample
hoppiness
taste
follows
the
nose
rich
full
dark
maltiness
and
prickly
hoppiness
warmth
at
the
close
mouthfeel
suffers
from
the
common
cisco
promblem
over
excessive
carbonation
all
the
bubbles
on
the
tongue
just
get
in
the
way
drinkability
is
alright
limited
by
bubbles
but
the
flavor
makes
me
want
more
not
bad
overall
makes
me
want
to
try
again
pours
a
pretty
opaque
black
color
with
a
monumental
dirty
white
head
great
tracing
tons
of
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
aroma
along
with
requisite
roasted
malts
a
touch
of
floral
and
citrus
hops
overall
its
seems
very
creamy
as
though
this
is
an
oatmeal
or
milk
stout
on
the
palate
the
roasted
and
black
malts
take
force
with
some
tough
bitterness
up
front
good
floral
hops
in
the
mid
palate
and
a
nice
roasty
finish
a
tad
thin
for
an
imperial
but
labeled
as
an
export
stout
its
quite
nice
the
coffee
flavor
really
continues
through
making
this
a
very
drinkable
stout
for
such
a
blustery
cold
day
d
fairly
easy
drinking
and
the
8
is
hidden
well
beer
just
seems
to
not
quite
reach
what
it
could
have
d
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
its
heavy
will
be
a
chore
to
finish
all
of
this
1pt
9
fl
oz
bottle
but
thats
to
be
expected
i
will
probably
get
it
again
at
some
point
overall
a
nice
choice
for
a
stout
i
prefer
stouts
that
are
more
on
the
chocolatey
side
rather
than
the
coffee
variety
but
this
is
something
i
would
get
again
a
full
flavored
export
stout
true
to
the
style
but
id
like
to
see
some
secondary
flavors
come
through
besides
the
rough
hops
and
roasted
malts
drinkability
nice
stout
here
i
will
definitely
drink
more
of
this
ifwhen
i
see
it
available
a
gift
from
a
friend
this
is
an
interesting
brew
its
completely
black
with
a
sticky
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
coffee
and
tobacco
mixed
with
a
little
alcohol
chocolate
and
charcoal
theres
a
lot
of
highly
roasted
and
nearly
burnt
grain
in
this
brew
its
taste
is
punctuated
with
a
lactic
sourness
but
it
is
framed
with
a
little
sweet
malt
theres
a
lot
of
flavor
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
of
dark
ripe
fruit
and
sweetness
not
very
bitter
its
full
and
mouthcoating
with
a
nice
complexity
very
good
b
overall
a
good
beer
recommended
drinkability
bearing
in
mind
the
source
this
beer
is
a
real
disappointment
i
havent
been
on
nantucket
since
1976
but
i
suspect
i
would
like
this
beer
a
whole
lot
better
if
i
were
there
put
a
date
on
it
cisco
drinkability
decent
but
personally
this
brew
did
not
satisfy
the
i
need
a
good
stout
urge
when
i
picked
up
the
bottle
worth
a
try
though
this
one
is
a
very
solid
offering
but
lacks
the
complexity
to
take
it
to
the
next
level
overall
a
great
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
md
other
than
the
massive
amounts
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
a
great
brew
a
high
quality
stout
poured
an
ink
black
with
a
huge
blooming
mocha
colored
headi
have
noticed
on
a
few
of
the
cisco
offerings
i
have
had
there
are
some
real
overcarbonation
issues
either
from
age
or
whatever
but
its
a
litle
annoying
the
nose
was
very
nice
highly
roasted
barley
smoke
and
charred
dark
fruit
mainly
with
a
lighter
roasted
nut
note
as
well
somewhat
prickly
mouthfeel
from
it
being
a
bit
overcarbonated
keeps
the
drinkabilty
from
being
all
that
greatflavor
wise
though
its
a
nice
brew
he
heavily
roasted
barley
and
smokiness
returns
along
some
kaluahlike
alcohol
sweetness
and
dark
fruit
finishing
somewhat
woody
a
big
complex
stout
i
bet
age
has
something
to
do
with
that
overcarbonated
body
i
would
love
to
taste
a
fresh
bottle
the
best
cisco
brew
i
have
tried
i
have
not
been
too
impressed
with
their
other
offerings
but
this
beer
is
very
very
good
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
porter
with
a
little
more
abv
kick
i
will
go
to
this
this
was
the
best
bottle
ive
ever
gotten
of
this
stout
ive
had
some
seriously
over
carbonated
bottles
and
ive
had
some
extremely
flat
bottles
they
seem
to
have
some
quality
control
problems
to
work
out
best
if
you
get
their
products
on
island
as
off
island
brews
are
not
the
same
complex
dry
but
easy
to
drink
the
dark
and
dry
onslaught
is
easier
on
the
palate
than
description
belies
a
winner
in
a
rare
and
underunderstood
style
once
the
carbonation
settled
down
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
though
a
bit
too
vinuous
for
my
tastes
update
after
contact
with
brewer
brewer
admits
to
carbonation
and
suggests
letting
the
beer
settle
offered
to
send
me
a
fresh
one
which
he
believes
will
not
be
as
heavily
carbonated
as
the
one
i
sampled
very
good
response
and
quick
will
update
after
i
have
the
next
one
worth
a
try
but
a
strange
brew
very
tasty
complex
and
drinkable
this
pours
a
ink
black
with
a
giant
tan
foamy
head
the
carbonation
is
really
something
you
can
hear
the
bubbles
the
smell
is
not
strong
and
kind
of
a
disappointment
you
can
make
out
some
coffeebut
thats
about
it
the
taste
has
a
good
deal
of
coffee
and
chocolatebut
it
may
be
too
carbonated
to
taste
the
more
subtle
flavors
the
beer
is
heavybut
the
balance
is
off
because
of
the
carbonation
thisother
than
the
carbonation
problem
is
a
damn
good
and
tasty
beer
that
i
will
try
again
mouthfeel
is
of
chocolate
and
black
malts
pumping
through
with
sweetness
and
a
mild
chewiness
mediumfull
bodied
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
towering
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
great
it
has
a
wonderful
black
and
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
hearty
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
rich
black
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
earthy
and
warm
it
has
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
along
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
bottle
conditioned
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
i
like
the
big
beer
feel
as
well
as
the
hop
character
its
a
tastey
brew
a
good
drinker
this
one
lets
a
nice
loud
pop
when
opened
a
small
bit
tried
to
escape
the
top
of
the
bottle
but
i
caught
it
before
it
could
make
its
way
out
it
pours
very
heady
about
4
fingers
over
top
the
foam
even
creaps
back
out
of
the
bottle
after
pouring
2
glasses
wow
at
least
it
has
good
retention
and
is
only
foam
im
having
a
hard
time
pouring
the
rest
of
the
beer
due
to
the
foam
the
beer
is
a
nice
black
color
the
nose
is
slightly
sour
that
somewhat
obscures
the
rest
of
the
nose
there
are
roasted
tones
hiding
behind
but
that
sour
really
takes
the
cake
the
flavor
is
also
slightly
sour
a
light
roasted
and
coffee
note
comes
through
but
the
sourness
really
puts
me
off
the
feel
is
light
with
a
light
carbonation
drinkability
is
actually
really
good
for
a
beer
of
8
its
the
flavor
and
nose
that
sort
of
turn
me
away
from
it
pours
a
dark
color
with
tremendous
sized
head
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
takes
forever
to
pour
and
the
bottle
wants
to
push
some
of
the
foam
out
of
the
bottle
while
were
waiting
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
chocolate
tones
along
with
some
other
dark
malts
the
flavor
has
a
lot
of
active
carbonation
good
chocolate
flavors
and
only
some
hints
of
other
dark
malts
the
roased
malts
seem
to
come
forth
more
as
it
warms
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
some
sourness
the
body
is
on
the
thick
end
of
moderate
but
the
carbonation
takes
a
little
away
from
it
the
drinkability
is
great
very
nice
beer
but
the
sour
distracts
a
bit
reminds
me
of
my
first
attempt
at
a
homebrew
a
caramel
porter
overly
sweet
that
comes
across
as
sour
pours
a
very
dark
brown
but
i
could
hardly
get
any
head
to
from
in
the
glass
spots
of
lace
around
the
glass
smell
is
really
sweet
and
makes
me
think
of
a
belgian
except
for
the
roasted
malt
aroma
odd
sugars
are
present
in
the
nose
flavor
is
really
sweet
like
sweetened
chocolate
but
just
the
sweet
and
no
chocolate
very
sour
caramel
and
toffee
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
is
deceptive
medium
body
but
very
thin
not
too
sure
i
am
gonna
be
able
to
finish
the
rest
of
the
bottle
drinkable
and
worth
a
shot
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
this
beer
poured
into
a
snifter
a
deep
black
with
virtually
no
highlights
it
was
topped
by
a
thick
tan
head
very
clumpy
that
clung
to
the
side
of
the
glass
in
chunks
the
aroma
has
black
cherry
and
licorice
backed
by
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
coffee
it
has
a
little
spice
aroma
in
the
finish
the
taste
has
a
nice
citrus
bitterness
up
front
backed
by
black
cherry
and
a
little
mocha
the
mouth
feel
is
full
with
a
nice
sharpness
left
by
the
hops
nice
drinakbility
i
was
expecting
more
heavy
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
so
i
found
the
berry
hints
nicely
refreshing
thanks
goes
to
sulldaddy
for
this
i
open
this
and
it
sat
for
112
to
2
hours
before
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
poured
dark
dark
brown
with
a
brown
head
aromabitter
sweet
chocolate
toffee
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
like
plums
hints
of
black
cherries
some
alcohol
all
the
thinks
i
like
in
a
dark
beer
flavorthe
cherries
came
out
1st
than
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
dry
mouth
feel
not
to
bad
d
three
of
the
four
people
in
the
tasting
group
poured
out
their
share
i
certainly
do
find
this
beer
interesting
but
i
think
i
would
have
perhaps
preferred
it
if
it
was
just
straight
imperial
stout
as
apposed
to
slightly
infected
imperial
stout
thanks
to
pisskynights
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
interesting
brew
while
not
as
thick
as
its
irish
cousins
this
is
a
flavorful
brew
i
suggest
avoiding
the
smell
and
enjoy
drinkability
is
average
very
creative
for
sure
but
low
mars
for
overall
appeal
ive
heard
this
place
makes
good
beer
ive
just
yet
to
witness
it
seems
like
a
pipe
dream
to
me
after
4
samples
that
were
either
way
overcarbonated
and
off
or
just
plain
ass
sour
do
they
have
quality
control
over
there
an
acidic
dark
malt
greets
you
in
the
nose
followed
by
some
sweeter
notes
of
rich
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
burnt
coffee
as
well
as
some
sprucelike
hoppiness
its
restrained
exceptionally
finebubbled
carbonation
and
lightmedium
body
leaves
it
silky
smooth
across
the
palate
the
flavor
is
bold
without
being
overdone
dark
malt
acidity
greets
you
upfront
its
definitely
not
acetic
or
lactic
but
it
is
somewhat
tart
followed
by
some
mild
notes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
and
then
some
sweeter
notes
of
creamy
caramel
restrained
but
distinctly
sprucelike
hops
appear
immediately
at
the
swallow
and
help
to
usher
in
its
dry
and
lingering
earthy
finish
its
quite
enjoyable
once
it
warms
a
bit
and
lends
more
breadth
to
its
character
certainly
worth
trying
this
came
in
a
nice
big
750ml
bottle
pours
out
black
with
a
tall
tan
head
there
were
decent
rings
of
lace
left
around
the
glass
as
it
is
consumed
aroma
smelled
of
licorice
fruit
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
an
odd
soy
sauce
type
note
taste
was
of
chocolate
coffee
a
bitter
earthiness
and
a
bit
of
sourness
very
complex
and
interesting
taste
but
the
sourness
and
another
odd
flavor
kept
me
from
enjoying
this
as
much
as
i
could
have
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
not
too
bad
drinkability
was
pretty
good
even
though
there
was
some
off
flavor
lingering
in
the
background
i
will
probably
give
this
another
chance
if
i
come
across
it
again
but
this
time
it
just
seemed
off
overall
the
quality
factors
were
not
worth
the
premium
price
that
i
paid
for
the
bottle
ill
wait
a
year
and
try
again
because
i
think
the
brewers
can
greatly
improve
this
recipe
a
very
good
stout
from
a
fine
little
brewery
but
like
most
of
the
products
ive
had
from
cisco
the
bottles
dont
age
well
and
are
usually
over
carbonated
drink
em
soon
after
you
buy
em
except
maybe
the
baggywrinkle
special
thanks
to
venom
for
this
brew
this
was
the
last
of
a
deliteful
cisco
sampler
and
i
enjoyed
every
one
of
em
definitely
a
foamer
luckily
i
was
quick
enough
to
get
it
to
the
sink
before
it
spewed
everywhere
but
thats
because
i
caught
it
before
the
lid
was
fully
off
huge
tan
head
eventually
fades
completely
away
the
black
body
has
a
bit
of
a
gray
cast
to
it
a
bit
of
the
imperial
stout
fruitiness
on
the
nose
over
a
little
chocolate
the
flavor
and
body
are
thin
some
chocolate
some
lingering
hop
bitterness
definitely
not
one
of
the
fuller
flavored
stouts
of
this
size
thanks
to
unclejimbo
for
this
bottle
on
the
pour
a
tall
dark
and
handsome
beer
this
one
the
head
a
majestic
chocolate
crown
that
is
creamy
in
consistency
with
the
lace
a
thick
and
sticky
blanket
upon
the
glass
toasted
grains
dominate
the
coffee
and
chocolate
like
nose
that
is
also
fresh
crisp
and
somewhat
sweet
nose
a
real
treat
to
sniff
start
is
thick
malt
sweet
and
the
top
full
bodied
and
in
feel
finish
is
delectable
in
its
hop
spicy
bite
the
carbonation
moderate
bittersweet
chocolate
dry
and
a
fine
drinking
stout
that
is
a
true
treat
just
a
shame
they
dont
export
this
far
west
good
thing
i
have
some
good
ole
ba
buddies
in
the
east
to
thank
for
this
one
prost
i
wish
i
had
retried
this
earlier
good
solid
stout
a
mild
but
incessant
gusher
beneath
the
tremendously
thick
excessive
carbonation
induced
dark
beige
sticky
head
lies
a
virtually
black
brew
with
flashes
of
clear
deep
garnet
when
held
to
light
with
patience
the
head
settles
into
a
manageable
blanket
of
loose
foam
fluff
sweet
milky
chocolate
malt
and
caramel
combination
upfront
in
aroma
supported
by
a
buttery
diacetyl
undertone
mellow
suggestion
of
mocha
dipped
pear

a
stately
fruity
contrast
understated
but
well
rounded
aromawise
sharp
lightly
tart
carbonic
acid
bite
hits
the
palate
at

then
yields
to
a

combination
of
burnt

bitterness
and
deeply
toffeeish
dark
lovibond
caramel
malt
roasted

allowing

faint

prune
like

late
along
with
a
mild
but
perceptibly
nut
driven
impression
of
spicy
nutmeg
and
dry
roasted
almond
persistently
prickly
in
mouthfeel
from
both
the
high
attenuation
and
over
carbonation
as
the
co2
dissipates
the
overall
body
is
revealed
to
be
thinnish
with
its
passable
viscosity
somewhat
akin
to
that
of
an
american
brown
ale
finishes
mostly
dry
yet
pleasantly
sweet
with
notes
of
molasses
drizzled
graham
crackers
and
butter
captain
swain
is
a
flavorful
stout
unfortunately
marred
by
overcarbonation
the
superfluous
attenuation
suggests
they
prematurely
bottled
this
is
more
spritzy
than
a
duvel
drinkability
is
only
decent
simply
due
to
the
inherent
patience
required
for
dealing
with
its
excessive
carbonation
almost
an
excellent
stout
but
their
yeast
strain
apparently
behaved
unpredictably
tasty
nonetheless
and
without
outright
flavor
flaws
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
again
the
phenolic
taste
and
high
carbonation
seem
to
be
an
acrosstheboard
problem
with
cisco
but
i
think
they
could
have
some
damn
good
brews
if
they
managed
to
fix
a
few
lingering
problems
still
this
is
an
extremely
tasty

stout
lost
13
my
big
bottle
to
the
overflow
doh
pour
really
really
dark
with
a
solid
head
quite
bitter
a
bit
of
sweet
other
than
a
slight
burnt
coffee
flavor
in
the
back
ground
this
come
across
as
a
quite
nice
beer
very
complex
ends
dry
not
the
best
stout
but
worth
a
sample
part
of
a
4bottle
sampler
pack
from
cisco
that
included
a
cd
of
some
truly
lame
whiteboy
island
groove
music
you
can
almost
picture
the
guys
practicing
all
summer
in
their
parents
vacation
beach
house
with
their
faded
college
baseball
caps
on
backwards
ah
nantucket
but
i
digress
on
to
the
beer
pitch
black
with
lively
head
that
recedes
almost
completely
a
couple
big
floating
chunks
of
yeast
perhaps
exceptionally
fruity
aroma
for
a
stout
with
some
burnt
brown
sugar
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
caramel
and
huge
roasty
malts
start
things
off
with
that
fruity
yeast
providing
an
eloquent
twist
letting
you
know
this
is
no
ordinary
stout
incorporates
sweeter
elements
of
an
oatmeal
stout
with
the
figgy
raisiny
elements
of
an
imperial
stout
or
robust
porter
finishes
with
an
excellent
balance
of
dryness
from
the
hops
and
sweet
fruitiness
that
is
pretty
wet
almost
cloying
tempting
you
to
go
back
for
more
this
is
a
pretty
remarkable
stout
it
requires
your
undivided
attention
sit
back
and
appreciate
the
achievement
of
balancing
the
roastiness
of
the
dark
malts
with
the
exciting
fruitiness
of
the
yeast
black
enough
to
leave
fingerprints
on
coal
this
brew
doesnt
allow
the
slightest
hints
of
light
around
its
edges
with
a
good
brown
head
that
sinks
but
leaves
a
nice
lace
huge
chocolate
aromas
along
with
some
nice
roasted
coffee
in
the
background
taste
starts
off
extremely
chocolatey
with
some
subtle
dark
roasted
coffee
flavors
tagging
along
all
the
way
through
the
brew
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitter
coffee
taste
that
is
a
perfect
ending
the
brew
is
very
creamy
but
not
quite
as
chewy
as
i
would
like
and
a
little
too
carbonated
this
brew
reamains
very
drinkable
and
is
yet
another
big
time
winner
from
cisco
brewers
a
first
taste
i
though
this
might
be
a
beer
to
have
just
one
and
go
to
something
else
by
the
end
of
the
glass
i
wanted
to
drink
it
all
night
notes
its
not
very
accessible
at
the
time
of
this
review
comes
in
big
bottles
and
is
7
a
pop
that
said
youd
probably
be
spending
your
money
well
as
this
is
a
very
decent
stout
with
some
rare
characteristics
for
the
market
big
time
smoke
flavours
complex
unique
and
robust
i
very
much
enjoyed
this
brew
overall
just
a
solid
brew
tasty
but
a
little
onenote
with
the
charred
flavor
and
expensive
too
for
what
it
is
i
had
this
beer
last
year
and
absolutely
adored
it
this
time
around
i
found
it
a
bit
lacking
but
still
very
very
good
i
question
this
particular
bottles
age
and
plan
on
rereviewing
the
first
chance
i
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
of
this
one
o
really
nice
stout
almost
more
of
an
oatmeal
stout
than
an
export
stout
tasty
and
roasty
more
can
i
say
its
nailed
like
the
others
overall
another
steel
toe
brew
that
i
tried
on
tap
loved
and
so
bought
a
bottle
to
review
very
tasty
stuff
hits
a
nice
balance
between
sweetness
and
dark
chocolate
bitterness
along
with
having
a
nice
feel
to
it
good
stuff
at
republic
uptown
served
in
a
pint
glass
with
a
thin
finger
of
dark
tan
frothy
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
and
breaks
down
rather
rapidly
brownish
black
in
color
aromas
of
rich
dark
chocolatey
malt
notes
of
rich
toasted
sugar
as
well
flavor
is
rich
dark
toasted
malt
with
characteristics
of
heavily
roasted
coffee
end
note
is
a
tad
bitter
from
the
dark
malts
medium
bodied
with
a
carbonation
level
a
bit
high
that
seems
to
bring
out
the
lingering
almost
astringent
aftertaste
from
the
roasted
malts
overall
a
decent
beer
that
could
benefit
from
a
little
less
in
your
face
dark
malt
and
better
balance
o
this
is
the
third
beer
ive
had
from
steel
toe
behind
size
7
and
rainmaker
and
im
not
quite
as
in
love
with
this
one
compared
to
those
two
the
flavors
and
smell
are
not
as
potent
as
id
like
and
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
its
a
solid
beer
but
i
dont
know
if
it
id
go
for
it
again
anytime
soon
enjoying
a
fresh
growler
from
the
brewery
today
poured
opaque
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
faded
quickly
to
a
persistent
skein
smell
was
roasted
malt
coffee
and
chocolates
very
nice
taste
had
nice
roasty
elements
deeply
roasted
malt
and
french
roast
coffee
sweet
and
semi
sweet
chocolate
late
on
the
palate
is
a
little
hint
of
dark
fruit
lightly
hopped
with
a
slight
hop
and
roasty
coffee
bean
like
bitterness
that
leaves
the
finish
clean
lightly
bitter
and
dry
nice
medium
body
creamy
texture
excellent
tasty
export
stout
overall
a
very
good
stout
very
forward
with
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
good
balance
between
the
sweetness
and
roasty
bitterness
if
i
had
regular
access
to
this
id
make
it
my
go
to
stout
especially
for
the
price
tag
this
is
my
2nd
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
already
sold
on
the
first
size
7
ipa
but
this
one
just
confirmed
their
consistency
to
pull
out
two
completely
different
styles
of
beer
so
damn
good
overall
okay
beer
but
pretty
one
dimensional
well
crafted
flavorful
ale
worth
seeking
out
overall
nice
fullbodied
stout
that
is
not
quite
imperial
good
mix
of
flavors
just
a
wee
bit
too
sweet
upfront
however
the
abrupt
transition
from
sweet
to
bitter
is
very
interesting
o
this
is
a
solid
brew
the
ipa
from
steel
toe
was
awesome
and
this
is
the
second
brew
ive
had
from
them
and
i
actually
might
like
it
even
more
this
is
a
stout
done
right
tone
the
alcohol
down
a
bit
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
all
day
a
ton
of
complexity
with
a
body
that
is
sooo
drinkable
makes
this
one
of
a
few
stouts
that
i
can
see
myself
drinking
over
and
over
again
it
doesnt
have
to
be
11
alcohol
in
order
to
pack
all
sorts
of
flavor
in
and
this
is
a
great
example
o
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
good
flavor
and
pretty
easy
drinking
for
a
7
abv
o
overall
this
beer
is
alright
i
think
its
just
a
little
too
coffee
bean
tasting
and
it
could
have
had
some
other
flavors
come
out
and
compliment
the
coffee
flavor
o
pretty
decent
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
o
a
wellcrafted
beer
i
must
say
was
surprised
by
this
one
and
really
enjoyed
my
pour
would
definitely
have
again
if
offered
i
would
say
this
is
more
export
stout
then
black
ale
because
of
the
lack
of
hops
overall
nothing
special
but
a
good
beer
and
a
solid
offering
from
steel
toe
d
as
a
black
ale
i
like
it
a
tad
better
than
the
summit
but
i
suspect
thats
mostly
because
this
is
far
more
stout
than
black
ale
definitely
a
tweener
so
im
going
to
have
to
evaluate
from
other
perspectives
and
split
the
difference
i
think
this
is
miscast
on
this
sight
as
a
foreign
export
stout
whereas
the
brewery
calls
it
a
dark
ale
i
think
it
is
a
well
done
dark
ale
but
it
would
certainly
be
lacking
some
girth
and
robustness
as
a
foreign
export
stout
despite
being
a
well
made
and
easy
drinking
dark
ale
but
i
really
wanted
more
of
the
chocolate
notes
to
shine
through
in
the
taste
after
sampling
their
other
beers
solid
brew
colored
just
a
bit
outside
the
lines
but
it
led
to
a
confusing
experience
i
would
buy
it
again
but
at
this
point
would
not
take
heroic
measures
to
do
so
i
think
it
really
needs
to
be
tried
on
its
own
and
then
revisitedlurpy1nov
15
and
a
touch
of
leather
slight
hops
medium
mouthfeel
starts
with
a
slight
bitter
roast
flavor
and
a
little
sweet
dark
fruit
and
then
moves
to
a
medium
hoppy
floral
bitterness
pretty
easy
drinking
slight
lace
no
notes
of
alcohol
not
sure
i
would
classify
this
as
a
stout
kbutler1oct

cocoa
overall
incredible
depth
of
flavor
and
another
astoundingly
good
product
from
this
brewery
would
highly
recommend
oa
roasty
bitter
stout
with
plenty
of
flavor
another
good
beer
from
enlightenment
overall
quite
nice
lots
of
dark
malts
all
over
the
place
roasty
and
mild
char
without
being
acrid
or
too
tannic
nice
fluffy
feel
light
and
airy
but
still
big
bodied
with
just
a
hint
of
booze
still
drinkable
and
quite
tasty
another
winner
for
enlightenment
really
liking
these
guys
just
wish
the
brut
special
wasnt
so
expensive
so
i
could
try
that
gets
better
as
it
warms
serve
chilled
at
the
coldest
8

o
huh
a
very
interesting
fes
heavy
on
the
char
it
would
be
too
much
but
the
soft
dark
fruitiness
really
mellows
it
out
and
integrates
well
definitely
a
well
attenuated
beer
little
sweetness
with
a
dry
finish
goes
down
very
easily
with
a
smooth
and
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
the
net
result
is
that
this
beer
keeps
bringing
you
back
for
another
sip
i
realize
beeradvocate
recently
rolled
out
a
new
rating
system
but
im
going
to
go
oldschool
on
this
one
this
beer
gets
a
5
0
for
drinkability
even
though
the
flavor
is
very
good
but
not
amazing
its
really
really
enjoyable
and
the
abv
doesnt
get
in
the
way
at
all
love
it
unlike
any
beer
ive
had
though
it
stands
outside
its
technical
guidelines
just
a
bit
though
whos
counting
rich
and
roasty
with
minimal
hop
presence
an
above
average
stout
one
two
three
four
five
luscious
in
taste
but
curiously
drinkable
in
body
its
offfull
texture
is
light
dry
and
arid
due
to
elevated
alcohol
acrid
roasted
nature
and
further
drying
to
exacerbate
the
coffeelike
textures
a
strong
linger
of
coffee
cocoa
and
smoldering
embers
extend
well
into
the
next
sip
and
keep
the
palate
satisfied
and
relaxed
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
schooner
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
low
profile
bubbly
dark
tan
head
aromas
of
bitter
roasted
coffee
bittersweet
bakers
chocolate
hints
of
smoke
peat
wood
and
earthy
highlights
and
a
note
of
tangy
cream
sweetness
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
forward
with
the
coffee
bitterness
all
over
the
forward
tongue
followed
by
a
solid
bittersweet
cocoa
nib
character
hints
of
old
world
fruit
sweetness
and
a
charsmoke
highlight
the
body
is
robust
and
smooth
almost
chewy
with
a
very
dry
undertone
that
carries
straight
through
to
the
dry
finish
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
coffee
and
chocolate
bittersweet
blend
very
solid
offering
in
the
export
style
i
have
always
loved
the
dark
stuff
these
guys
do
and
this
one
takes
it
to
the
next
level
for
me
so
smooth
and
velvety
in
feel
almost
like
a
milk
stout
except
for
how
dry
it
is
really
impressive
there
muted
black
in
the
glass
solid
tan
head
on
the
pour
but
it
doesnt
hold
long
i
smell
very
dark
unmalted
barley
roast
and
meadow
honey
with
english
ale
yeast
a
super
cool
combination
of
aromas
and
i
think
true
to
but
evolving
the
export
stout
style
which
we
need
more
of
in
the
american
market
anyway
i
do
get
some
honey
flavor
without
sweetness
in
the
middle
with
an
almost
ashy
barley
char
on
either
end
of
it
you
would
almost
think
this
was
oaked
it
has
mellow
coffee
and
cocoa
notes
but
stays
on
the
lighter
side
of
that
aside
from
the
barley
bitterness
complex
and
bold
but
just
silk
going
down
i
think
the
feel
is
my
favorite
part
i
could
easily
do
a
four
pack
of
these
in
a
sitting
its
unique
enough
to
warrant
contemplation
but
familiar
and
drinkable
enough
to
drink
hard
on
i
think
anchor
has
been
one
of
the
masters
of
that
phenomenon
and
this
is
the
best
new
beer
i
have
had
from
them
in
moons
absolutely
worth
picking
up
especially
if
you
are
as
big
a
fan
of
anchor
as
i
am
wish
the
bitterness
were
less
prevalent
and
that
the
acrid
character
werent
present
think
the
black
malt
character
is
overdone
alcohol
is
definitely
noted
im
going
to
miss
this
one
when
its
gone
anchor
yeast
smell
choclatey
roastiness
chewy
texture
and
medium
to
dry
finish
does
anchor
do
bold
they
certainly
do
bold
with
this
one
a
wellmade
export
stout
the
bready
chocolate
aroma
really
it
smells
like
cake
and
coffee
is
followed
by
a
fruitier
character
with
dark
ripe
berry
notes
and
a
roasted
finish
this
covers
a
lot
of
ground
and
it
doesnt
feel
too
heavy
give
it
a
shot
uninspired
and
uninteresting
reminded
me
of
seltzer
o
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
is
this
keg
really
around
a
year
old
a
thick
hearty
stout
with
a
huge
malty
flavor
straightup
slightly
overbaked
homemade
chocolate
chip
cookie
love
this
o
very
nice
was
on
the
menu
as
a
cappuccino
stout
and
id
say
it
fit
the
bill
nice
espresso
notes
and
a
nice
dry
finish
great
beer
few
stouts
out
there
can
approach
this
ones
quality
if
you
can
find
this
brew
try
it
seriously
on
tap
at
2
brothers
pours
a
rich
black
color
with
half
an
inch
of
medium
brown
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
earthy
with
some
chocolate
vanilla
and
caramel
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malts
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
earth
and
some
dark
fruit
notes
hints
of
smoke
light
velvety
mouthfeel
roasted
malts
and
some
chocolate
at
the
finish
very
little
alcohol
presence
overall
a
damn
fine
export
stout
worth
having
again
i
suppose
in
an
absolute
sense
there
are
probably
better
stouts
out
there
but
in
terms
of
true
drinkability
where
abv
and
price
are
issues
this
is
pretty
close
to
perfection
a

anchor
stepping

the
box
had
this
one
on

at

in

very
good
hope
that
anchor
considers
putting
this
beer
into
a
permanent
rotation
very
smooth

and
overall
a
very
drinkable
stout
drinks
a

very
enjoyable
and
well
brewed
overall
overall
a
decent
brew
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
succession
but
thicker
darker
harder
than
a
the
other
brews
to
breed
a
continuity
but
a
very
decent
product
this
was
a
nice
beer
it
was
rich
and
had
good
drinkability
my
only
complaint
was
the
sweet
graininess
that
came
through
otherwise
this
was
a
nice
stout
that
is
worth
a
try
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
cookie
dough
taste
is
much
the
same
with
vanilla
and
cocoa
powder
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
and
tasty
flavors
definitely
the
best
of
the
zymaster
series
so
far
in
my
opinion
pretty
close
to
black
crowned
with
a
rock
solid
tight
beige
head
smells
of
caramel
bread
and
cocoa
roastiness
roasted

flavor
caramel

someday
black
with
thick
brown
foam
chocolaty
and
vanilla
on
the
nose
but
more
sweet
vanilla
bean
than
anything
also
smells
of
cool
co2
and
steel
starts
off
mellow
not
as
sweet
as
expected
a
very
mild
chocolate
cocoa
starts
and
and
a
cocoa
bittering
follows
up
quickly
with
some
complexity
very
much
like
milk
chocolate
followed
by
dark
chocolate
a
sweeter
vanilla
finishes
long
with
a
subtle
wood
and
nutmeg
note
superbly
balanced
which
makes
it
a
great
beer
for
the
long
haul
i
really
like
this
overall
an
excellent
high
quality
export
stout
i
can
certainly
see
why
it
boasts
all
the
medals
theyve
won
on
the
label
deserves
every
one
of
them
very
nicely
done
and
impressive
for
a
7
beer
the
feel
could
use
a
bit
of
beefing
up
perhaps
but
the
rest
of
the
show
is
a
treat
glad
this
one
showed
up
locally
and
if
i
see
it
again
ill
be
all
over
it
highly
recommended
this
stout
was
excellent
i
want
to
say
that
i
had
it
caskconditioned
at
the
brewpub
which
made
it
even
more
excellent
great
color
balanced
flavor
and
paired
very
well
with
my
food
thumbs
up
all
around
for
this
one
some
malty
sweetness
tannic
with
chocolate
milk
old
coffee
perfume
dry
winey
finish
decent
foam
in
the
tall
glass
from
the
22
oz
bottle
worth
a
try
but
another
one
of
those
10
bombers
that
i
doubt
id
buy
again
based
on
price
alone
overall
a
robust
and
dark
stout
that
has
very
prominent
roasted
malt
and
light
burnt
bitterness
characteristics
overall
i
like
this
and
think
i
will
try
more
from
alameda
id
recommend
anyone
who
likes
stouts
meet
this
bear
overall
doesnt
match
stout
elements
for
style
more
of
a
dark
cascadian
ipa
very
light
mouthfeel
and
heavy
hops
bittering
throws
one
off
from
thinking
stout
looks
very
appealing
dark
rich
brownblack
with
a
sudsy
tan
head
aromatics
are
roasted
yet
there
is
some
sweetness
that
comes
through
taste
is
also
roasted
and
coffee
like
kind
of
dry
i
can
taste
the
rye
a
bit
and
there
is
a
woodsy
character
to
it
the
feel
is
very
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
overall
i
enjoyed
this
and
would
have
again
when
in
the
mood
for
this

one

i

reminds

a

i
love
the

i
am
getting
out

this
that
compliment
the
chocolate

roasted

o
a
very
tasty
treat
super

not

no

at

stout
grab
one
quick
if
you
can
edit
i
just
noticed
the
bottle
date
was
very
recent
122112
perhaps
this
beer
would
do
better
with
some
aging
a
decent
unspectacular
beer
that
i
will
try
at
least
once
more
when
i
have
a
shot
at
a
fresh
bottle
and
if
required
will
amend
my
review
accordingly
as
it
stands
its
a
good
stout
not
a
great
one
that
requires
any
kind
of
fevered
search
thanks
mdaschaf
for
the
opportunity
quite
nice
one
of
the
better
foreign
stouts
overall
a
very
good
stout
appearance
is
a
very
dark
almost
black
with
very
little
head
and
lace
aroma
of
sweet
dark
light
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
having
a
dark
fruit
note
taste
of
the
previous
aroma
with
a
light
bite
from
the
hops
leaving
a
light
bitter
roast
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
with
a
light
carbonation
a
nice
enjoyable
stout
black
with
a
dense
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
this
looks
pretty
good
the
nose
is
surprisingly
good
creamy
chocolate
mild
coffee
more
cream
and
some
rye
spiciness
theres
also
some
licorice
present
the
palate
is
a
blend
of
cream
sweetness
more
lactose
than
caramel
with
creamy
chocolate
a
mild
bitterness
a
flavor
that
makes
me
think
debittered
malt
a
little
bit
of
rye
spiciness
the
licorice
comes
through
on
the
mid
palate
not
as
roasty
as
i
was
expecting
but
not
surprising
given
the
style
sweet
on
the
finish
with
lactose
chocolate
coffee
and
minimal
bitterness
this
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
and
has
a
wonderful
creamy
carbonation
it
really
is
nice
on
the
palate
yummy
id
drink
this
again
o
good
i
can
see
why
this
one
gabf
medals
a
complex
and
flavorful
stout
this
is
not
one
to
have
several
of
but
to
sit
back
sip
and
enjoy
its
feel
is
smooth
enough
to
compliment
the
taste
and
the
roasted
bittering
is
not
overpowering
a
welldone
beer
to
have
from
time
to
time
o
great
smell
above
average
look
and
taste
but
weak
feel
above
average
brew
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
but
for
the
6
8
the
body
was
about
as
full
as
youd
expect
smooth
and
not
overly
heavy
drinkability
was
good
if
you
like
the
big
stouts
youll
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
a
good
solid
example
of
the
style
one
thats
certainly
worth
trying
when
you
see
it
im
glad
they
decided
to
export
this
to
the
foreign
land
of
canada
an
interesting
stout
that
surprised
me
a
little
where
it
counts
and
that
is
the
flavor
not
really
roasted
and
bitter
but
with
some
tartness
overall
a
pretty
mild
export
stout
but
quite
drinkable
nonetheless
i
would
have
this
again
o
the
over
carbonation
really
hurts
this
beer
it
brings
both
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
way
down
im
not
a
fan
im
pleased
to
have
tried
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
in
the
future
overall
bizarre
stout
quite
drinkable
but
doesnt
really
fit
the
bill
for
the
style
great
beer
d
this
is
a
great
beer
loved
it
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
on
nitro
o
highly
drinkable
fes
this
is
a
touch
better
than
guiness
foreign
extra
stout
but
still
not
as
good
as
zonker
in
my
opinion
beer
is
medium
in
body
but
thinner
on
the
finish
and
in
the
middle
sweet
up
front
heavy
coffee
and
some
bitter
on
the
backend
overall
a
decent
beer
pretty
enjoyable
id
have
it
again
comes

a
bubbly

is

thick

has
a

and
leaves
a
fizzy
smoky
finish
a
sexy
american
beer
bar
offering
if
there
ever
was
one
chocolate
cream
malt
and
a
somewhat
offbalance
sourness
that
eventually
wends
its
way
through
your
acceptance
gates
oh
and
the
nitro
from
beginning
to
end
this
special
serving
slides
down
like
butter
but
tastes
way
way
better
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
recommend
anyone
with
an
avenue
to
the
pacific
northwest
find
this
stout
and
enjoy
it
cheers
overall
a
simply
amazing
drink
drinks
like
milk
only
better
for
you
this
is
a
smooth
wellbalanced
drinkable
stout
tastes
very
similar
to
terminator

in

is

it

otherwise
a
tasty
beer
picked
up
a
bomber
back
in
the
summer
of
2008
and
have
been
aging
it
in
my
cellar
ever
since
tonight
my
wife
and
i
drank
it
for
a
special
occasion
along
with
a
dessert
of
chocolate
cake
poured
into
brooklyn
brewery
goblets
dark
brown
color
with
a
thin
but
thick
beige
head
some
lacing
on
the

not
a
lot
smell
had
a
nice
roasted
barley
smell
to
it
with
just
a
hint
of
pine
tingling
my
nose
the
taste
was
excellent
it
really
had
an
enjoyable
flavor
of
burnt
espresso
but
with
a
hint
of
bittersweet
chocolate
mouthfeel
was
moderate
but
not
overly
thick
it
was
on
the
smooth
side
an
easy
stout
to
drink
and
very
tasty
at
the
same
time
a
nice
accompaniment
to
a
rich
dessert
d
not
heavy
enough
to
be
a
sipper
but
a
solid
well
put
together
beer
d
what
this
beer
is
is
a
really
good
representation
of
its
style
flavor
is
very
balanced
and
nothing
really
sticks
out
feel
is
appropriate
and
real
heavy
in
a
good
way
for
its
abv
drinkable
too
as
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
silky
dthis
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
just
dont
think
it
accurately
reflects
the
style
and
it
is
no
where
near
as
good
as
my
favorite
stouts
of
any
style
alameda
is
scheduled
to
be
at
the
salem
beer
and
cider
festival
this
saturday
and
i
would
like
to
think
what
i
just
had
was
uncharacteristic
seems
to
be
from
other
reviews
but
not
sure
i
want
to
use
a
tasting
token
to
try
this
again
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
got
the
perfect
mouth
feel
with
a
nice
look
and
delicious
taste
to
back
it
up
i
expected
a
little
more
from
the

that

with
friends
nothing
surprising
about
the
appearance
big
and
black
with
a
tan

i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
because
it
wasnt
the
usual
thick
chewy
stout
instead
it
was
a
touch
lighter
like
an
export
stout
should
be
with
two
dominant
characteristics
dry
roasted
black
malts
and
sweet
cocoa
chocolate
heck
of
a
beer
checkthis
out
overall
i
really
enjoyed

xx
its
very
dark
and
appealing
and
the
taste
is
wonderful
best
aspect
of
this
beer
is
the
mouth
feel
its
incredibly
smooth
and
goes
down
as
such
if
youre
ever
in
portland
this
is
a
must
have
beer
d
overall
a
pretty
well
balanced
beer
but
lacked
just
a
little
something
special
in
the
flavor
profile
solid
but
not
outstanding
d
not
great
but
solid
drinkability
a
pretty
average
example
of
a
stout
nothing
really
stood
out
except
for
the
coffee
and
molasses
which
arent
my
preferences
for
a
stout
this
was
recommended
to
me
from
one
of
the
belmont
station
employees
and
i
was
impressed
worthy
of
the
awards
it
has
won
overall
a
stout
with
good
drinkability
that
could
use
a
bit
more
black
malt
d
good
overall
very
enjoyable
for
the
style
mfd
i
love
the
mouth
feel
of
this
stout
the
texture
and
carbonation
are
spot
on
the
body
has
a
rich
fullness
to
it
and
feels
slick
on
the
tongue
moderate
carbonation
makes
it
very
drinkable
overall
impression
excellent
stout
easy
to
see
why
it
won
gold
at
the
gabf
a
few
years
back
after
having
this
beer
i
am
bumbed
that
we
did
not
get
to
make
it
out
to
the
alameda
brewpub
this
was
pretty
good
and
heard
it
is
not
even
one
of
their
better
beers
would
drink
again
worth
trying
poured
into
a
chalice
a
dark

nice

nice
little
fizzy
tan
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the

the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
with
lots

dark
stuff

this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
my
first
from
this
brewery
thanks
brian
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
in
some
ways
it
seems
more
like
a
baltic
porter
than
a
stout
but
a
bit
of
sourness
isnt
uncommon
in
a
fes
and
the
body
is
a
bit
big
for
a
bp
pours
a
pretty
opaque
black
some
dark
reddish
highlights
but
almost
impossible
to
see
through
very
thick
light
brown
head
forms
slowly
drops
to
a
thick
layer
and
ring
leaving
a
ton
of
lace
chunks
stuck
to
the
glass
smell
is
nice
lightly
lactic
lots
of
caramel
chocolate
milk
very
roasty
quite
fruity
some
vanilla
light
orange
peel
cherries
some
coffee
pretty
neat
taste
is
similar
some
lactic
sourness
milky
chocolate
very
roasty
some
vanilla
fruity
more
chocolate
milk
pretty
interesting
stuff
lightly
toasty
oaky
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pretty
silky
and
smooth
some
acidic
roasty
character
pretty
cool
stuff
thanks

pours
a
jet
black
with
creamy
tan
head
that
takes
a
little
while
to
dissipate
once
the
head
dissipates
it
leaves
nothing
but
a
tan
ring
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
faint
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
watery
upfront
that
develops
into
a
chocolate
bitterness
that
lingers
for
awhile
its
a
fairly
mediumbodied
beer
that
has
plenty
of
carbonation
its
a
very
drinkable
stout
in
general
but
just
not
something
i
would
continually
reach
for
with
plenty
of
other
options
available
d
pretty
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
and
other
then
the
drying
effect
this
has
it
isnt
too
bad
d
im
surprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
despite
a
couple
of
complaints
this
is
an
example
of
a
solid
stout
and
at
6
8
a
very
drinkable
one
supergood
drinkability
tastes
so
light
and
sessionable
but
yet
hides
any
strength
it
may
posses
a
good
regular
staple
stout
for
anyone
who
loves
a
winner
d
easily
drinkable
i
know
that
i
will
drink
this
one
again
i
am
just
having
a
hard
time
getting
over
the
fruity
sourlike
characteristics
not
as
if
they
are
overpowering
but
they
are
teasing
this
beer
from
being
a
awesome
stout
drinks
kind
of
slow
if
your
into
very
dry
with
belgian
influenced
tendencies
this
isnt
my
back
but
i
could
see
where
some
folks
would
love
this
hv
so
far
alameda
brewhouse
has
failed
to
impress
me
black
bear
xx
is
a
classic
example
of
how
addition
by
subtraction
would
result
in
a
much
better
beer
subtracting
the
sourness
would
add
immeasurably
to
both
flavor
and
drinkability
too
bad
ill
probably
never
get
to
try
it
again
to
put
that
theory
to
the
test
alameda
makes
a
good
foreignstyle
stout
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
drink
again
black
bear
xx
is
a
robust
stout
with
moderate
enough
alcohol
to
drink
a
few
at
a
time
its
too
bad
this
isnt
available
in
my
area
thanks
for
the
great
extra
brian
a
solid
very
black
stout
with
huge
tan
head
and
a
nice
roasty
nose
this
is
a
drinking
stout
that
has
all
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavours
but
no
sharp
edges
not
the
biggest
stout
on
the
block
but
very
well
put
together
and
oh
so
drinkable
worth
buying
bomber
bought
from
capital
market
salem
gorgeous
looking
beer

good
stuff
nicel
on
the
palte
not
as
heavy
as
expected
and
thats
a
good
thing
as
it
adds
a
point
or
two
for
drinkability
over
all
nice
beer
served
on
nitro
at
the
brewpub
an
unbeleivably
smooth
stout
with
dry
character
lots
of
roastiness
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
and
its
not
overly
strong
meaning
that
you
can
and
should
have
more
than
one
or
two
the
body
is
sultry
and
polished
perfectly
black
truly
a
standout
beer
well
done
this
is
a
unique
stout
worth
a
try
this
stout
was
velvety
smooth
and
felt
great
in
my
mouth
and
going
down
my
throat
it
was
extremely
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
especially
for
such
a
big
bold
stout
definitely
something
ill
get
again
d
a
very
big
and
smooth
tasting
stout
ultra
tasty
and
refined
but
perhaps
a
strong
one
for
multiple
tastings
a
winner
and
worthy
of
tasty
again
d
i
split
the
bomber
with
my
wife
it
was
okay
but
the
aftertaste
was
a
bit
too
much
to
take
poured
from
the
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
body
is
a
deep
rich
black
hue
topped
by
an
inch
of
thick
creamy
tan
head
beautiful
aroma
of
sweet
rich
roasted
malt
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
milk
chocolate
palate
is
rich
and
sweet
tons
of
rich
roasted
dark
and
chocolate
malt
with
notes
of
vanilla
mocha
milk
chocolate
and
a
very
mild
hop
bitterness
finish
is
smooth
and
wellbalanced
between
the
rich
malt
and
the
subtle
hop
profile
body
is
thick
smooth
and
creamy
just
wonderful
goes
down
very
easily
for
a
strong
stout
im
a
big
fan
i
didnt
really
care
for
the
taste
of
this
one
and
by
the
end
of
the
2nd
snifter
from
the
bottle
i
was
pretty
sick
of
it
it
wasnt
that
heavy
though
though
so
if
its
your
thing
its
probably
pretty
drinkable
just
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
im
compelled
to
try
this
on
nitro
at
the
brewery
now
that
i
live
here
although
i
cant
say
im
in
a
big
hurry
to
do
so
hopefully
itll
be
more
enjoyable
and
ill
rereview
same
goes
for
the
bottle
im
cellaring
this
is
a
solid
stout
made
for
the
purist
thanks
to
msubulldog25
for
the
chance
to
sample
this
fine
brew
thanks
to
cmaruschak
for
sharing
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
reddish
halo
and
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
dissipates
steadily
roasty
aroma
of
coffee
and
malt
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
a
rather
sharp
bitterness
around
the
edges
the
nitro
smoothness
seems
to
contradict
the
somewhat
harsh
acidity
in
the
flavor
malt
and
coffee
flavors
keep
it
from
falling
apart
luckily
the
finish
is
creamy
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
to
say
the
bottle
had
turned
but
something
seemed
a
little
off
about
this
pours
like
motor
oil
with
a
four
finger
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
totally
black
color
light
carbonation
and
very
heavy
bodied
chocolate
nose
starts
with
a
bitter
chocolate
flavor
some
middle
sweetness
finish
has
a
slight
bitterness
a
decent
stout

a
worthy
twotime
winner
of
the
gabf
foreign
style
stout
category
m
d
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
awesome
on
this
offering
from
alameda
full
bodied
but
very
well
balanced
low
carbonation
allows
you
to
fully
taste
the
chocolate
and
caramel
this
is
what
a
stout
should
taste
like
two
thumbs
up
for
alameda
if
i
had
another
id
drink
it
right
now
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
gotta
get
out
to
the
left
coast
soon
very
full
body
it
tried
to
be
milky
but
was
more
creamy
easy
and
smooth
drinking
not
so
much
a
cloying
finish
but
more
of
a
thorough
finish
very
nice
afternoon
working
my
way
through
my
pint
thanks
kim
for
the
growler
comments

i
would
have
had
to
pretend
to
like
it
anyway
since
skyhand
was
sitting
next
to
me
and
wouldnt
shut
up
about
how
great
it
is
so
it
was
a
real
bonus
that
i
liked
it
so
much
wow
the
nitro
sample
was
drastically
better
than
the
cask
version
in
almost
every
way
the
nitro
stout
was
very
enjoyable
complexly
rich
and
masterfully
balanced
with
a
nice
sharpness
that
love
in
dark
beers
scores
are
based
solely
on
the
nitro
version
granted
it
went
quite
well
with
the
muscles
i
cant
explain
why
that
is
but
it
does
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
once
i
had
one
i
had
to
have
another
even
though
i
wanted
to
try
some
of
the
othere
from
this
establishment
ive
revisited
this
beer
on
several
occasions
and
have
reaffirmed
that
its
credentials
are
sustainable
and
intact
black
bear
xx
is
rich
chocolaty
and
beautiful
you
can
drink
it
as
easily
in
july
as
in
january
like
black
silk
on
tap
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
slight
cocoa
and
a
weird
plastic
smell
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
coffee
grounds
there
is
a
medium
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
plastic
aroma
i
am
getting
from
this
one
is
odd
overall
a
solid
stout
d
pretty
good
roasty
stout
that
is
kind
of
dry
and
sweet
too
almost
like
a
cross
between
a
milk
stout
and
a
dry
irish
stout
o
all
of
the
above
o
simply
painful
and
atrocious
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
what
a
stout
should
look
like
in
a
pint
its
a
pitch
black
without
any
head
stability
which
is
a
disappointment
there
isnt
a
really
good
aroma
from
this
brew
which
comes
as
a
surprise
i
get
small
hint
of
dark
chocolate
thats
it
it
leads
me
to
be
curious
of
the
taste
it
taste
of
black
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
in
the
beginning
and
finish
way
to
quickly
like
a
irish
stout
overall
its
a
nice
brew
for
such
a
commercial
company
like
oggis
average
on
everything
else
this
is
a
standard
stout
and
i
really
dont
desire
another
this
is
a
very
good
export
stout
that
i
think
would
be
great
if
the
bitterness
was
ramped
down
a
touch
i
do
like
the
big
sweet
chocolate
aroma
as
its
a
bit
different
for
a
dry
stout
overall
very
tasty
good
rich
espresso
flavors
and
character
with
a
nice
hop
balance
but
something
is
missing
you
want
more
of
all
of
it
lacks
a
bit
of
a
body
and
lacks
a
richness
in
flavors
and
character
very
nice
coffeebitter
hop
long
finish
best
part
of
beer
is
the
finish
which
is
very
roasted
grain
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
with
plenty
of
hop
finish
character
beer
is
just
a
bit
thin
and
simple
and
lacking

opinion
as
always
d
pretty
drinkable

beer

oggis

the

much
for

was
pleasanty
surprised
how
it
won

award

ill
never
know
coffee

astringent

best
oggis
beer
ive
had
this
is
a
lovely
stout
rich
aroma
full
of
coffee
roasted
grains
and
hops
for
me
the
coffee
was
in
the
foreground
and
the
chocolate
played
second
however
when
drinking
the
chocolate
stepped
up
and
played
nice
with
the
coffee
flavors
were
well
balanced
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
full
smooth
drinkability
was
a
bit
to
good
this
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
an
outstanding
beer
experience
recommended
if
you
are
a
stout
fan
but
does
not
go
well
with
food
and
has
a
long
dry
aftertaste
coffee
flavor
went
on
long
into
the
finish
opaque
in
appearance
with
a
small
head
this
brew
had
a
little
more
fruitalcohol
flavor
to
it
than
your
typical
stout
cocoa
molasses
fruit
and
bitter
roasted
malts
make
up
the
flavor
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
around
but
more
complex
than
the
amber
ale
i
had
earlier
which
keeps
you
coming
back
to
your
glass
for
another
sip
on
tap
at
oggis
corona
ca
location
pitch
black
body
with
off
white
head
taste
had
some
chocolate
with
some
deep
coffee
flavor
hiding
in
the
back
too
but
the
dominant
taste
was
something
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
here
but
was
very
distinct
i
want
to
say
it
was
sort
of
like
a
black
licorice
or
some
other
sort
of
candy
flavor
you
have
when
youre
a
kid
and
you
avoid
eating
them
the
rest
of
the
time
because
its
a
strange
although
not
bad
flavor
i
didnt
like
the
quantity
that
this
flavor
came
in
if
they
dialed
it
down
a
notch
and
brought
up
the
other
flavors
a
bit
i
would
like
this
stout
much
more
i
got
this
in
a
growler
bif
and
even
after
all
of
the
traveling
this
jug
it
still
was
able
to
put
a
mocha
colored
head
on
top
of
its
pitch
black
body
in
my
glass
the
head
even
stayed
around
for
a
couple
minutes
this
stout
has
a
good
roasted
aroma
with
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
background
it
has
a
creamy
medium
bodied
feel
and
strong
roasted
flavors
there
are
also
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
there
as
well
but
are
not
nearly
as
powerful
as
the
roasted
taste
its
a
good
example
of
a
stout
and
i
like
it
ontap
at
carmel
country
road
black
with
some
mocha
head
lots
of
lace
bitter
high
carbonation
dinkable
but
this
seemed
like
a
guiness
clone
roasted
body
with
coffee
very
dry
coffee
grounds
malts
get
it
done
but
just
an
average
beer
and
below
average
stout
this
past
sunday
i
tried
out
a
beer
from
oggis
there
is
one
of
these
san
diego
favorites
right
near
my
parents
house
in
glendale
and
we
have
had
pizza
there
many
times
for
various
birthdays
this
time
when
picking
up
a
couple
of
pies
i
popped
over
to
the
bar
to
try
out
one
of
their
brews
i
opted
for
the
black
magic
stout
mostly
because
i
hadnt
had
a
stout
in
a
while
and
with
the
weather
cooling
off
it
feels
like
it
is
the
season
the
first
thing
i
noticed
is
that
appeared
to
be
dispensed
though
a
nitrogen
tap
as
the
tap
for
this
beer
was
different
from
the
rest
the
beer
came
with
a
very
light
head
because
of
this
there
wasnt
much
lacing
or
lasting
head
which
i
blame
on
the
tap
more
than
anything
else
light
aroma
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
great
mouthfeel
due
mostly
to
the
nitrogen
it
was
very
drinkable
but
with
its
relatively
high
alcohol
content
i
wouldnt
want
to
push
it
too
far
drinkable
to
a
point
there
is
a
very
creamy
mouthfeel
to
this
beer
i
am
guessing
that
this
has
been
dispensed
via
nitrogen
rich
flavors
lean
towards
chocolate
with
a
roast
character
as
a
back
drop
which
is
opposite
of
the
aroma
the
chocolate
note
almost
has
a
milk
chocolate
leaning
to
it
i
think
the
sweet
maltiness
accentuates
the
milk
chocolate
perception
there
is
a
certain
chalkiness
here
which
i
have
been
associating
as
of
late
with
roast
grain
notes
this
is
quite
drinkable
almost
light
despite
its
richness
and
i
think
that
the
nitrogen
tap
has
helped
with
this
the
roast
character
adds
a
certain
acidity
to
this
beer
as
well
which
seems
to
lighten
things
up
a
bit
as
well
this
beer
has
been
the
best
of
the
beers
that
i
have
had
from
the
scottsdale
oggis
it
is
rich
flavorful
satisfying
yet
still
dangerously
drinkable
i
typically
dont
like
chain
brewpubs
but
oggis
is
better
than
most
and
their
best
beer
is
as
good
as
anyones
this
brew
poured
dark
as
midnight
with
a
small
head
nose
was
wonderful
of
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
was
good
was
a
nice
mix
of
chocolate
malts
and
nicely
balanced
with
a
dry
hop
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
nothing
outstanding
and
a
bit
thinner
than
the
better
stouts
drinkability
was
good
it
was
very
enjoyable
and
with
not
too
high
an
abv
where
one
could
enjoy
several
pints
cheers
upon
pour
the
head
dissipated
fairly
quickly
a
rich
creamy
malty
smell
felt
pretty
good
on
the
tongue
it
was
extremely
fullbodied
with
a
great
roasted
flavor
very
smooth
and
good
and
there
was
virtually
no
aftertaste
an
allaround
good
stout
beer
pours
a
deep
dense
black
with
tons
of
head
lace
is
plentiful
on
my
glass
smells
rich
of
burnt
choclate
coffee
dark
roasted
malts
flavor
opens
bitter
and
acidic
i
can
almost
feel
the
enamel
peeling
away
from
my
teeth
well
hopped
is
this
stout
burnt
molases
dark
chocolate
espresso
and
sweet
brown
sugar
hit
the
taste
buds
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
very
clean
finishes
with
a
light
chocolate
syrup
and
moderate
coating
on
the
throat
this
is
the
finest
example
of
the
style
that
i
have
encountered
extremely
drinkable
this
beer
is
dark
dark
dark
in
color
with
no
light
passing
though
the
blackish
brown
beer
the
head
is
a
tan
sandy
head
that
retained
very
well
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
all
dark
malts
and
caramel
malts
with
sweetness
to
lure
you
in
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
and
sour
malty
flavors
dominate
the
taste
there
is
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
it
is
clean
and
not
very
sticky
in
the
mouth
which
made
it
a
very
pleasant
beer
to
enjoy
with
pizza
drinkability
overall
very
acceptable
now
if
it
were
only
served
above
40
a
very
enjoayable
brew
this
one
poured
a
dark
black
color
with
a
good
sized
off
white
head
that
left
great
rings
of
lace
down
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
coffee
and
had
a
hint
of
malt
in
there
as
well
the
taste
was
smokey
from
start
to
finnish
with
just
a
touch
of
burnt
malt
in
the
mix
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
due
to
its
porter
like
mouthfeel
and
smoothe
flavor
id
definantly
order
this
gem
again
the
nice
almost
black
body
is
topped
by
a
creamy
tan
head
this
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
a
good
amount
of
caramel
in
the
flavor
and
a
little
roast
its
not
too
heavy
but
to
get
that
its
also
a
little
thin
its
a
fairly
tasty
stout
but
underwhelming
compared
to
certain
others
dark
black
color
aroma
is
mild
malts
chocolate
and
coffee
a
medium
bodied
stout
malts
are
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
a
middle
of
the
road
stout
nice
but
not
very
interesting
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
i
have
had
this
stout
on
several
occasions
at
the
oggis
in
mission
viejo
california
as
a
general
comment
as
far
a
chain
brewpubs
go
this
is
a
decent
stout
overall
when
compared
to
other
micros
this
is
mediocre
dry
stout
if
youre
at
oggis
its
worth
having
as
part
of
the
sampler
btw
look
for
coupons
in
the
local
paper
frequently
there
are
coupons
for
the
samplers
since
my
first
taste
of
it
at
the
san
diego
beer
fest
2001
ive
said
thats
its
the
best
stout
within
san
diego
city
limits
ive
taken
several
other
stout
drinkers
there
and
they
had
also
concluded
it
was
an
outstanding
beer
recommended
a
nice
smoky
offering
from
oggis
in
mission
viejo
the
brew
was
quite
black
and
opaque
with
a
light
tan
head
that
laced
very
well
the
nose
and
taste
gave
off
a
smoky
roasted
sense
that
was
very
pleasant
to
the
palate
chocolate
predominates
throughout
the
beer
and
is
very
nice
with
some
light
hints
of
coffee
it
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
nice
beer
not
great
but
pleasant
great
beer
with
a
nice
khaki
head
smells
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
burnt
malt
taste
similar
chocolate
coffee
slight
dark
malty
sweetness
no
bourbon
detected
somewhat
disappointed
in
that
however
still
a
delicious
beer
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
graytan
tightly
packed
head
around
the
perimeter
the
nose
is
mainly
milk
chocolate
sweetness
with
minimal
bitterness
or
coffee
the
taste
id
compare
more
to
a
porter
than
a
stout
roasty
and
malty
slight
coffee
presence
and
yeast
minimal
booze
or
bitterness
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
reasonable
carbonation
and
a
very
drinkable
malty
finish
im
not
picking
up
much
from
the
special
coffee
beans
used
to
make
this
beer
which
is
disappointing
though
its
not
mindblowing
its
still
a
solid
beer
very
full
body
overall
this
is
so
easy
to
drink
for
a
stout
that
7
5
abv
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
smell
became
stronger
and
fragrant
as
it
warmed
up
the
flavors
were
rich
with
a
strong
roasted
character
and
the
mouthfeel
added
another
dimension
good
bit
of
coffee
could
have
more
mild
bourbon
some
roasted
malt
little
bit
of
chocolate
o
the
astringency
is
pretty
high
in
this
and
is
on
the
verge
of
offputting
but
this
is
otherwise
a
very
substantial
export
stout
that
smells
amazing
it
also
helps
when
this
is
served
at
cellar
temperature
rather
than
straight
out
of
the
fridge
when
its
chilled
all
you
get
is
the
astringent
burnt
coffee
flavour
o
a
very
unique
and
complex
beer
that
drinks
much
bigger
than
its
7
5
abv
seek
this
out
this
would
be
an
outstanding
dessert
beer
or
afterdinner
drink
a
real
sipper
as
the
bourbon
character
is
surprisingly
rich
even
though
this
beer
is
not
barrelaged
interesting
to
say
the
least
pitch
black
with
a
deep
brown
head
that
is
well
carbed
the
smell
is
folgers
or
your
basic
office
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
so
is
the
taste
you
get
a
fairly
cheap
coffee
flavor
with
some
roast
from
the
malt
not
sure
the
barrel
aged
coffee
beans
added
anything
perhaps
it
muted
the
coffee
this
is
a
pretty
unique
take
on
a
coffee
stout
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
22oz
bottle
pours
a
blackish
dark
brown
color
with
a
half
inch
of
medium
brown
head
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
coffee
and
maybe
a
hint
of
bourbon
the
taste
is
dark
chocolate
roasted
malts
black
coffee
and
some
wood
nice
hint
of
bourbon
with
some
warming
alcohol
vanilla
and
nuttiness
near
the
end
finishes
with
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
light
bourbon
notes
light
mouthfeel
the
bourbon
soaked
coffee
beans
creates
a
nice
balance
between
the
chocolate
coffee
and
bourbon
flavors
overall
fantastic
beer
overall
this
is
definitely
not
your
everyday
stout
or
coffee
stout
or
ba
stout
this
is
certainly
richer
than
black
house
but
i
dont
know
that
its
better
and
i
dont
think
its
quite
as
tasty
as
monsters
park
still
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
proof
positive
that
bourbon
barrels
dont
make
everything
better
i
much
prefer
black
house
to
this
beer
the
barrel
aged
beans
somehow
contribute
a
high
pitched
astringency
sharp
wafts
of
black
marker
and
burnt
matches
and
a
palate
almost
cloying
in
chocolatey
sweetness
more
black
markerblack
licoriceand
weird
phenols
black
house
is
a
pretty
solid
coffee
stout
im
surprised
that
mt
has
missed
on
quite
a
few
of
their
other
stouts
pours
beautifully
aroma
is
devastatingly
pungent
with
incredible
roasts
cocoa
vanilla
flavor
matches
the
aroma
deep
and
sweet
loved
its
roasted
complexity
if
you
like
stouts
that
are
coffee
forward
you
better
to
try
this
im
not
sure
how
this
beer
is
categorized
as
a
foreign
stout
but
it
is
damn
good
for
the
abv
one
of
the
smoothest
richest
and
most
balanced
beers
ive
ever
had
in
the
stout
category
for
someone
who
loves
coffee
stouts
this
is
a
musttry
i
gotta
get
my
hands
on
those
coffee
beans
they
make
a
big
impact
with
this
one
and
it
works
great
bb
coffee
beans
wish
i
thought
of
that
such
a
wonderful
beer
the
nose
is
a
blend
of
cocoa
chocolate
roast
and
a
minty
coffee
character
hints
of
vanilla
are
present
the
palate
has
a
blend
of
smooth
dark
chocolate
roast
some
oak
and
the
most
incredibly
unique
coffee
character
ive
had
super
green
mildly
earthy
very
floral
and
very
minty
this
is
fantastic
while
this
alone
would
make
a
beer
interesting
the
structure
and
the
integration
are
quite
spectacular
ill
have
to
get
more
of
this
o
i
hate
coffee
and
was
pretty
bad
imo
very
robust
coffee
bitter
towards
the
end
just
everything
that
makes
coffee
well
coffee
also
is
the
primary
factor
in
this
beer
i
wont
have
it
again
although
i
hate
it
im
not
docking
them
on
points
ive
had
enough
stouts
to
know
overall
this
is
a
tasty
and
complex
little
brew
its
on
the
verge
of
being
world
class
maybe
a
more
richer
body
the
flavors
are
balanced
and
not
clashing
on
the
taste
buds
this
is
one
to
seek
out
and
worthy
of
your
time
i
love
how
the
coffee
roast
is
both
intense
yet
not
going
overboard
with
acidity
this
brew
is
recommended
one
of
the
better
coffeeflavored
brews
ive
had
potent
in
every
way
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
barons
market
on
west
point
loma
really
interesting
some
times
no
ba
have
a
hard
time
being
up
to
snuff
but
this
is
realy
great
i
get
a
lot
of
berry
flavors
with
some
subtle
oalyvanilla
too
good
this
rich
stout
was
amazing
had
a
real
chocolatey
malty
kick
to
it
amazed
on
how
rich
the
flavor
of
the
aged
coffee
beans
that
where
used
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
one
finger
mocha
head
the
smell
is
quite
unique
rubber
coffee
there
is
definitely
a
bourbon
presence
but
it
is
not
accompanied
with
vanilla
that
i
would
expect
the
flavor
is
very
roasty
its
interesting
to
have
bourbon
flavor
without
the
wood
aging
i
like
it
a
lot
there
is
no
booze
present
which
is
kind
of
refreshing
o
this
beer
improves
as
it
warms
took
a
drink
straight
from
the
fridge
but
as
it
sat
some
of
the
nuances
came
through
there
is
a
nice
fruity
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
but
i
did
not
get
much
bourbon
its
not
bad
one
i
would
not
pass
up
but
i
mostly
likely
will
not
seek
this
out
again
if
you
love
coffee
stouts
and
barrel
aged
stouts
then
this
one
is
worth
a
try
but
i
think
there
are
better
coffee
stouts
and
barrel
aged
stouts
out
there
and
this
one
ranks
really
low
for
me
delicious
coffee
stout
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
but
this
one
was
so
flavorful
with
pleasant
bourbon
and
coldbrew
coffee
notes
that
i
had
to
love
it
not
to
my
taste
i
think
its
the
booziness
all
i
can
say
is
wow
the
barrel
aged
coffee
in
this
gives
it
just
the
right
amount
of
bourbon
character
give
it
a
try
i
might
have
been
too
hard
on
it
this
is
a
very
confusing
beer
it
has
the
look
and
scent
of
and
ba
imperial
stout
but
the
taste
is
very
smooth
with
a
hint
of
booziness
associated
with
a
ba
stout
mouth
feel
is
the
same
as
black
house
light
and
crisp
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
a
very
nice
stout
with
great
coffee
flavor
i
feel
that
this
brew
is
misunderstood
having
had
some
of
mts
barrel
aged
coffee
i
know
where
they
are
coming
from
with
this
one
its
the
beans
that
are
barrel
aged
not
the
brew
you
really
pick
that
up
on
the
nose
very
smooth
and
mellow
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
but
it
was
disappointing
looks
nice
dark
brown
with
a
finger
of
khaki
colored
head
the
aroma
is
really
odd
kind
of
a
charcoal
or
burnt
wood
chips
and
something
i
cant
place
on
the
taste
i
get
the
barrel
and
then
the
burnt
flavor
i
got
from
the
smell
some
mild
bitter
chocolate
and
finishes
very
nutty
this
beer
could
benefit
from
some
more
sweetness
and
i
dont
like
over
sweet
stouts
but
i
feel
its
needed
here
dont
really
get
any
bourbon
either
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
for
the
style
i
was
really
pumped
up
to
drink
this
and
was
hoping
for
more
coffee
you
get
a
small
amount
of
coffee
in
the
form
of
burnt
coffee
beans
but
thats
about
it
i
am
a
big
fan
of
mts
hoppy
offerings
but
the
monsters
park
was
disappointing
and
this
one
follows
the
stout
disappointment
trend
unfortunately
nice
looking
beer
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
and
good
retention
the
aroma
is
of
vanilla
burnt
oak
and
burnt
coffee
with
a
smoky
note
the
spirit
character
is
strange
somewhat
sharp
and
harsh
with
an
almost
sour
flair
the
flavor
is
acrid
burnt
coffee
and
astringent
oak
with
some
chocolate
and
vanilla
again
the
spirit
character
and
oak
are
unpleasant
though
the
chocolate
and
vanilla
provide
some
respite
from
the
acrid
coffee
i
could
do
without
ever
having
barrel
aged
coffee
in
any
form
again
serving
type
bottle
22
ounce

really
liked
the
bourbon
soaked
coffee
bean
aroma
and
flavor
on
this
very
smooth
floral
and
fruity
gonna
get
some
more
this
coffee
bourbon
stout
sets
itself
apart
from
the
rest
by
avoiding
the
alcohol
and
the
booziness
that
typically
is
associated
with
bourbon
barrel
aged
coffee
stouts
flavor
is
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
i
think
it
is
a
little
dry
on
the
finish
but
no
real
hints
of
booze
im
not
sure
if
the
dryness
is
imparted
by
the
oysters
or
if
they
do
something
else
that
i
am
missing
a
nice
solid
drinkable
stout
with
a
fairly
high
abv
at
7
5
i
would
buy
this
again
even
though
im
not
sure
what
the
oysters
add
to
the
beer
thanksgiving
day
beer
tasting
at
bros
house
final
score
3
95
overall
a
more
robust
oyster
stout
with
a
great
approach
uncertain
which
i
prefer
more
dogfish
at
5
5
or
exit
1
at
7
5
depends
on
occasion
i
give
the
edge
for
pleasure
to
dogfish
and
for
flavor
density
but
that
the
cost
of
a
higher
abv
to
exit
1
try
them
both
i
havent
given
flying
fish
much
thought
due
to
the
fact
that
their
beers
sit
on
shelves
here
for
ages
at
total
wine
but
this
beer
has
convinced
me
to
give
them
another
look
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
little
or
no
alcohol
bite
a
good
tasty
stout
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
the
contribution
from
the
oysters
are
absolutely
present
in
all
aspects
of
the
beer
nose
flavor
and
mouthfeel
i
would
however
enjoy
exit
1
a
bit
more
if
it
possessed
more
substantial
i
e
chewy
body
mashing
at
a
higher
temperature
would
achieve
this
result
but
more
malt
would
need
to
be
used
to
achieve
the
same
abv
4
5
o
this
has
been
a
want
of
mine
for
a
while
only
because
when
the
exit
series
was
first
rolled
out
years
ago
i
wanted
the
exit
1
entry
just
to
add
to
my
bottle
collection
because
im
from
delaware
never
found
it
the
first
time
around
and
they
stopped
making
it
for
years
when
i
heard
they
were
bringing
it
back
on
the
market
and
in
6packs
no
less
i
had
to
get
my
hands
on
it
found
a
sixer
when
i
was
visiting
home
and
come
to
find
out
the
beer
itself
is
really
good
too
o
interesting
beer
saltiness
chocolate
roasty
bitterness
coffee
even
some
fruity
sweetness
complex
almost
busy
flavor
profile
not
something
id
be
falling
down
to
get
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
a
beer
connoisseur
to
add
to
their
repertoire
from
12
ounce
bottle
to
pint
glass
pours
black
tan
khaki
head
no
light
coming
through
aromas
of
roasted
malt
coffee
hint
of

flavor
is
well
balanced
some
burnt

medium

slightly
dry

i
like
this
beer
its
a
nice
change
up
from
all
the
coffee
stoutsporters
and
russian
imperial
stoutsba
riss
that
are
so
popular
now
they
used
the
oysters
in
the
boil
which
they
said
gives
the
beer
a
nice
dryness
o
strange
briny
smoky
weird
ditto
for
the
booze
this
certainly
wasnt
a
session
beer
but
youd
never
know
it
until
you
looked
at
the
bottle
no
roasted
heavy
motor
oil
to
be
found
here
while
this
was
a
foreignexport
stout
a
beer
like
made
me
think
that
oyster
stouts
should
be
in
a
class
by
themselves
this
was
thin
enough
to
go
down
smoothly
but
solid
enough
in
body
to
savor
and
once
again
flying
fish
has
outdone
themselves
with
this
latest
entry
in
the
exit
series
find
this
open
it
and
savor
it
its
a
lot
better
and
possibly
cheaper
than
taking
the
turnpike
all
the
way
down
to
its
southern
terminus
highly
recommended
o
my
first
oyster
stout
and
it
was
a
memorable
one
try
this
for
a
fresh
take
on
stouts
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amoubt
of
carbonation
it
is
a
fairly
decent
export
stout
with
the
expected
mineralsaline
character
present
from
the
oyster
aspect
i
think
i
held
on
to
this
brew
too
long
i
am
giving
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
it
was
probably
a
beer
best
served
more
fresh
than
this
o
another
really
enjoyable
beer
from
the
exit
series
i
thought
this
was
a
really
easy
to
drink
oyster
stout
i
loved
the
brininess
combined
with
burnt
and
heavily
roasted
malt
flavors
o
this
beer
is
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
has
a
good
amount
of
flavors
o
really
enjoyed
this
guy
a
to
a
beer
o
overall
a
good
stout
a
bit
different
flavor
profile
perhaps
from
the
oysters
but
there
is
nothing
oystery
about
this
beer
maybe
a
bit
minerally
but
that
is
it
quite
charcoalyroasty
and
chocolately
goes
down
fairly
easily
but
not
something
i
could
go
thru
more
than
a
bottle
in
a
session
a
really
great
stout
with
the
bonus
of
being
of
the
export
style
and
oysters
added
for
is
pretty
mellow
but
enjoyable
depth
id
love
to
seem
them
bring
this
one
back
o
great
beer
it
has
fantastic
dry
coffee
finish
i
love
that
must
be
from
black
patent
or
the
like
i
really
enjoy
the
roastiness
i
also
enjoy
the
sweeter
upfront
taste
although
would
like
more
milk
chocolate
in
the
taste
that
was
noticed
in
the
aroma
good
stuff
aging
didnt
make
this
beer
worse
its
great
while
exit
1
may
fall
short
on
individual
characteristics
it
is
easily
drinkable
perhaps
not
a
typical
session
beer
given
its
7
alcohol
paired
with
good
friends
and
nursed
along
in
a
dogfish
head
snifter
one
could
make
a
long
lazy
afternoon
more
enjoyable
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
stout
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
but
overall
the
flavors
could
have
a
bit
more
presence
kicked
up
a
notch
this
would
be
an
exceptional
brew
as
it
stands
now
this
is
definitely
a
worthy
brew
that
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
not
my
favorite
stout
but
far
from
bad
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
that
could
benefit
from
more
complexity
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
heavy
thick
looking
black
color
with
a
nice
slow
rising
brown
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
lots
of
roasted
malt
aromas
and
some
chocolate
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
good
lots
of
roasted
chocolate
flavors
and
just
a
very
slight
spice
note
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
thick
and
creamy
overall
this
beer
didnt
smell
or
taste
anything
like
oysters
thankfully
i
found
this
brew
to
be
really
quite
nice
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
sessionable
brew
just
nothing
that
will
bowl
you
over
good
stuff
sweet
is
begin
and
then
tart
with
a
little
hop
finish
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
export
stout
i
like
the
exit
series
from
flying
fish
d
the
smokesalt
nose
and
palate
is
very
interesting
im
not
exactly
sure
what
i
should
expect
with
a
foreign
export
stout
but
this
seems
like
a
cross
between
a
smoked
stout
and
a
ris
im
digging
it
the
exportstyle
quality
of
this
stout
seems
a
little
lost
to
its
oily
salty
clamjuice
nuances
nullifies
whatever
maltsugarysweet
elements
may
be
present
superb
balance
of
roastiness
mild
dark
espresso
and
depth
of
body
however
clean
lightly
saline
and
slicksmooth
lacks
the
heavier
feeling
of
most
of
the
export
stouts
ive
had
wouldve
wanted
a
little
more
syrupy
feel
but
i
cant
complain
about
what
it
offered
the
keg
was
well
over
a
year
old
and
it
suffered
not
begged
attentive
sipping
it
was
black
no
head
englishstyle
pour
heh
quaffable
for
sure
studious
refined
but
it
didnt
dazzle
the
senses
surprisingly
enjoyable
coming
from
ff
do
more
like
this
overall
nothing
id
seek
out
again
but
nothing
offensive
either
i
would
love
to
get
another
one
of
these
i
personally
think
it
falls
under
a
stout
from
the
roasty
ness
hardly
any
alcohol
detected
in
this
one
d
very
interesting
but
the
complexities
seem
to
be
overpowered
as
the
beer
warms
by
the
chocolatey
malt
and
alcohol
i
think
this
would
be
nice
with
some
creamy
stew
dtotally
solid
and
a
very
nice
job
done
with
this
rare
style
glad
to
see
them
use
local
product
for
this
beer
as
the
heyday
of
the
oyster
industry
in
nj
is
a
distant
memory
to
most
well
done
ff
jet
black
with
a
hearty
one
finger
head
that
hung
around
a
bit
good
nose
of
well
stout
huge
fan
of
oysters
so
i
was
curious
the
effect
that
the
oysters
had
on
the
dark
bitter
chocolate
roasted
grains
and
malt
and
they
definitely
make
this
a
very
dry
stout
i
can
lash
back
all
nite
long
love
the
smokiness
expected
a
bit
more
brine
from
the
oysters
down
the
hatch
slick
and
slippery
just
like
a
sweet
jersey
oyster
big
fan
o
this
brew
wish
it
was
a
everyday
release
from
the
cherry
hill
fellas
would
love
to
try
this
on
draught
d
a
good
stout
thick
and
chewy
id
have
another
d
not
super
drinkable
its
one
of
thos
ebeers
that
kind
of
intense
in
its
overall
character
one
is
enough
rich
dry
chocolaty
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
engaging
beer
its
a
deep
black
color
with
a
thin
chocolatemilk
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
subdued
although
some
heavily
roasted
grain
scents
do
waft
out
the
flavor
is
very
nice
dry
intense
lots
of
dark
malts
and
intensely
charred
grains
very
little
hop
flavor
or
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
and
silky
with
a
medium
body
altogether
these
components
make
this
a
wonderfully
drinkable
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
the
carbonation
is
light
the
beer
was
easy
to
drink
and
an
above
average
beer
many
thanks
to
sholand
for
sending
this
beer
to
me
d
a
nice
deep
winter
beer
its
freezing
out
so
this
beer
is
perfectly
drinkable
to
me
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
but
not
my
favorite
example
by
a
long
shot
i
wasnt
prepared
for
the
smokiness
i
hate
smoke
beers
as
an
fyi
but
this
is
still
quite
nice
despite
my
typical
preferences
i
really
enjoy
these
exit
beers
and
look
forward
to
the
next
one
taste
reflects
the
nose
in
the
flavor
profile
with
additional
black
licorice
in
it
sorry
but
i
cant
get
past
the
unusually
dry
gritty
almost
calcium
filled
dryness
of
this
beer
i
had
to
end
this
bottle
prematurely
md
a
touch
on
the
light
side
but
still
medium
bodied
maybe
a
bit
week
by
export
stout
standards
an
above
average
stout
and
certainly
easy
drinking
but
nothing
fantastic

heavy
side

good
beer
i
wanna
know
who
first
thought
up
the
idea
of
using
oysters
in
beer
just
seems
odd
to
me
oh
well
this
guy
pours
an
oily
black
topped
by
a
finger
of
burnt
sienna
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
vanilla
chocolate
mint
and
molasses
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
some
brown
sugar
coffee
figs
and
blackened
pretzels
you
know
the
bottom
of
the
pretzel
its
the
char
the
dough
and
the
salt
altogether
here
thrown
in
to
make
things
more
interesting
the
body
is
a
fairly
hefty
medium
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
fairly
smooth
rather
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
oyster
stout
but
im
not
sure
im
fully
used
to
the
style
yet
hv
notes
nice
oyster
stout
with
a
shy
and
expected
salty
touch
profile
again
if
one
is
expecting
the
oyster
burst
this
is
not
the
brew
but
for
a
balanced
offering
with
a
bit
of
a
sea
touch
it
is
rather
pleasing
beer
is
really
good
medium
bodied
clean
and
sweet
lots
of
malt
up
front
a
very
good
stout
im
liking
these
foreign
export
stouts
more
and
more
good
mouthfeel
and
really
high
drinkability
drinkability
its
easy
enough
to
drink
the
big
bottle
will
not
be
a
chore
to
drink
and
given
the
opportunity
id
enjoy
it
again
as
it
is
tasty
enough
and
theres
no
sign
of
the
alcohol
at
all
again
i
just
expected
more
pours
a
black
color
with
a
brown
dense
creamy
head
that
settles
into
a
thick
ring
the
aroma
is
big
on
dark
bitter
chocolate
charred
wood
and
light
smoke
nice
and
earthy
the
taste
is
of
bitter
amd
milk
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
light
charred
woodsmoke
the
body
is
light
to
moderate
seems
a
tad
thin
for
the
style
the
carbonation
is
fairly
soft
which
adds
to
the
creamy
texture
of
this
stout
finishes
with
a
roasted
malt
bitterness
definitely
a
tastey
stout
though
a
bit
thin
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
didnt
pick
up
anything
from
the
oysters
which
i
believe
usually
adds
a
mineral
characteristic
indeed
worth
the
purchase
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
then
average
with
moderate
to
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
very
nice
stout
flavors
like
the
other
oyster
stout
ive
had
the
oysters
really
dont
give
much
flavor
to
the
beer
they
did
seem
to
give
it
a
little
something
in
the
aroma
though
the
beer
really
is
all
about
the
stout
flavors
which
thankfully
are
pretty
good
i
liked
the
roasty
and
bitter
chocolate
flavors
it
had
a
lot
though
drinkability
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
stout
where
the
lightness
of
the
mouth
feel
and
texture
give
a
nice
balancing
effect
to
the
dark
flavors
form
the
malts
making
it
quite
easy
to
keep
sipping
through
this
one
until
it
is
gone
while
i
may
have
this
one
again
the
fact
that
it
is
a
oneoff
brewing
will
limit
the
number
of
times
i
have
it
in
the
future
d
i
can
definitely
see
this
going
will
with
oysters
again
the
carbonation
issue
affects
the
overall
drinkability
great
offering
from
flying
fish
i
would
pair
this
with
obviously
oysters
but
also
other
fried
seafood
perhaps
calamari
or
the
like
as
the
briney
flavor
would
be
phenominal
with
this
beer
for
a
stout
the
drinkability
is
very
high
but
only
because
it
doesnt
feel
at
all
heavy
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
looking
forward
to
a
tinge
of
saltwater
but
if
no
one
told
me
oysters
were
used
in
production
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
myself
drinkability
you
can
drink
this
stout
easily
considering
the
abv
being
so
high
but
the
complexity
just
falls
flat
for
me
to
thin
and
watery
though
the
flavors
it
does
present
are
all
right
i
cant
picture
if
i
was
gonna
drink
something
with
this
high
of
an
abv
i
would
settle
for
one
this
simple
again
and
okay
beer
but
so
many
better
stouts
out
there
flying
fish
to
me
usually
makes
okay
beers
but
really
never
great
a
great
roasted
malty
sweetness
on
1st
sip
not
overly
rich
but
not
a
heavy
mouth
feel
kind
of
a
chocolate
mixed
in
the
hearty
roasted
stout
taste
permeates
hints
of
malt
smoke
and
wood
in
the
finish
this
was
a
really
satisfying
stout
and
the
balance
with
the
taste
is
fine
i
hope
this
comes
out
more
because
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
tasty
and
unique
stout
the
flavor
has
a
few
nice
touches
that
you
dont
get
in
your
average
stout
a
better
mouthfeel
would
have
pushed
this
to
an
even
higher
score
would
love
to
be
able
to
pick
up
this
beer
again
overall
a
solid
stout
that
packs
a
tasty
malt
punch
good
body
thats
not
too
heavy
and
nice
flavor
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
and
thanks
to
josh
for
sharing
this
one
my
first
oyster
stout
as
advertsied
i
think
this
would
pair
fantastically
with
oysters
or
a
nice
hearty
stew
d
very
nice
dry
stout
with
a
subtle
hop
character
and
smoked
quality
i
found
this
to
be
up
to
the
normal
standards
of
the
other
exit
series
releases
a
tasty
and
well
crafted
stout
thanks
for
taking
chances
flying
fish
i
poured
from
a
25
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
is
obsidian
black
with
a
rock
solid
mound
of
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
rich
roasty
and
full
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
full
and
has
lots
and
lots
of
chocolate
malt
in
it
it
is
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
dont
know
if
the
oysters
added
anything
to
the
beer
other
than
curiosity
overall
it
is
a
solid
interesting
beer
that
i
just
may
purchase
again
exit
1
the
third
in
the
series
is
more
interesting
than
good
maybe
flying
fish
felt
that
a
darker
bolder
richer
maltiness
would
have
crowded
out
the
oyster
flavor
it
might
have
and
would
have
required
a
name
change
but
it
would
have
made
for
better
beer
in
the
end
thanks
to
jwc215
for
the
bottle
so
far
this
has
been
a
good

to

i
liked

does
keep

its
still
pretty

how
roasty
the

is

is

compliments

it

similar

in
my

with
addition
of
the
briny
oyster

detectable
at
the

well
worth
a
try
really
wish
that
i
had
this
with
a
strong
complimentary
cheese
or
something
else
to
help
cut
the
heavy
salt
profile
i
may
have
enjoyed
its
unique

a
little
more
oysters
lend
a
touch
of
brinesea
salt
and
the
rich
chocolatey
maltiness
would
have
this
pair
well
with
oysters
unfortunately
i
didnt
try
it
with
oysters
but
im
seriously
considering
getting
another
bottle
to
test
out
my
theory
that
it
would
work
very
well
a
unique
offering
that
has
a
solid
foreignexport
stout
character
grab
a
bottle
if
you
can
this
was
handed
to
me
with
a
finger

deepbrown
head
interlaced
with
black
and
shifting
around
like
rorschachs

it
eventually
settled
into
a
slick
of
brown
foam
on
top
of
an
inky
black
beer
its
color
was
midnight
black
with
zero
light
penetration
the
nose
had
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
mocha
and
even
a
bit
of
charcoal
mouthfeel
wavered
between
medium
and
full
with
the
coffee
and
charcoal
up
front
followed
by
a
more
mellow
mocha
sweetness
and
a
dark
chocolate
finish
owner
gene
muller
stated
that
they
had
never
before
made
a
stout
and
i
hope
that
they
do
not
stop
now
by
golly
it
was
a
phenomenal
entry
in
the
series
even
if
i
have
missed
a
couple
of
exits
in
my
journey
i
would
have
really
liked
this
had
it
been
in
a
smaller
bottle
or
i
just
had
one
glass
on
tap
all
in
all
i
liked
the
char
and
the
coffee
but
the
oysters
grew
and
grew
to
be
too
big
for
me
fairly
drinkable
drinkability
well
definitely
a
tasty
beer
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
guess
in
my
tiny
pee
brain
i
actually
thought
there
would
a
fairly
noticeable
oyster
taste
i
love
oysters
the
beer
is
good
and
its
a
great
export
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
impeccable
and
definitely
the
best
part
of
the
beer
good
stuff
all
around
thanks
jeff
d
enjoyable
drink
refined
smooth
though
found
myself
oddly
enough
wishing
for
more
of
an
oyster
presence
felt
they
may
have
played
it
a
bit
safe
here
and
could
of
made
a
statement
of
definition
per
style
many
people
may
be
turned
off
by
the
notion
of
an
oyster
stout
but
fear
not
this
has
very
little
presence
mostly
only
in
name
with
the
exception
of
a
light
saltiness
the
roasted
and
chocolate
malting
make
this
a
smooth
experience
and
one
that
should
not
be
missed
however
i
found
this
beer
to
be
lacking
the
wow
factor
i
experience
with
their
first
2
turnpike
beers

a
capped
750ml
bottle
purchased
at
abes
in
bethlehem
for
around
7
poured
into
my
ithaca
shaker
glass
and
allowed
to
warm
up
for
about
a
half
hour
the
stout
appears
an
opaque
brown
color
with
a
good
inch
of
fluffy
dark
ecru
head
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
nicely
roasted
malt
milk
and
bittersweet
chocolate
caramel
vanilla
a
fair
amount
of
light
charsmoke
molasses
mocha
it
might
be
subliminal
because
i
know
this
is
brewed
with
oysters
but
im
picking
up
a
somewhat
salty
and
sour
brackish
brininess
here
the
brine
plays
second
fiddle
to
the
roast
smoke
and
chocolate
though
great
body
creamy
very
dry
and
amply
carbonated
with
a
lingering
bitter
sweet
smoky
mildly
sour
finish
really
nice
stuff
thats
worth
checking
out
the
taste
is
quite
good
the
beer
has
some
drying
qualities
that
mix
quite
nicely
with
some
sweeter
dark
malts
there
are
some
charring
qualities
some
burnt
molasses
qualities
some
roasted
english
toffee
some
dry
irish
stout
too
the
creaminess
the
subtlety
of
the
beer
and
its
full
palate
and
drinkability
make
this
beer
a
real
find
lchaim
cheers
overall
very
solid
and
really
quite
nicely
done
i
have
to
admit
name
alone
scared
me
off
but
there
was
no
reason
for
it
this
was
just
a
nicely
done
stout
all
the
way
around
mmmm
you
dont
get
many
oyster
stouts
in
this
case
the
seafood
character
is
pretty
mild
and
just
adds
a
pleasant
but
curious
meaty
character
otherwise
theres
a
big
roasty
chocolate
taste
with
toasted
bread
and
crust
plus
dry
cocoa
and
hard
candy
caramel
it
finishes
with
a
dry
bitter
and
burnt
finish
despite
the
strength
this
isnt
a
big
heavy
beer
its
quite
drinkable
if
you
dont
feel
like
sharing
a
750ml
bottle
drinkability
is
averageplus
good
stuff
overall
but
id
like
to
see
that
oyster
assert
itself
just
a
little
more
poured
deep
mahogany
nearblack
into
an
american
pint
glass
with
a
thin
tan
head
and
very
little
lace
the
aroma
was
dominated
not
surprisingly
by
cocoa
and
bittersweet
chocolate
and
further
revealed
a
feint
roasted
malt
presence
the
taste
as
well
was
dominated
by
chocolate
but
the
roasted
malt
was
more
prominent
as
well
and
the
finish
was
surprisingly
dry
with
the
tiniest
hint
of
hop
bitterness
for
such
a
chocolatey
beer
i
found
the
body
to
be
spritzier
and
thinner
than
expected
maybe
too
much
co2
in
the
tapping
anyway
the
flavor
profile
wasnt
overpowering
and
this
went
down
fairly
easily
id
love
to
try
this
on
nitro
first
i
love
this
jersey
turnpike
exit
series
concept
this
beer
is
said
to
be
brewed
with
oyster
shells
but
i
could
not
taste
it
or
know
what
if
any
influance
they
had
in
this
beer
very
nice
dry
type
stout
that
poured
black
with
dark
tan
creamy
head
and
good
lacing
bitter
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
very
drinkable
stout
drinkability
this
beer
is
one
you
enjoy
slowly
one
bottle
was
sufficient
in
a
session
this
was
a
nice
change
up
in
flavor
for
a
stout
and
it
is
quite
enjoyable
there
is
little
trace
of
the
titular
oyster
in
the
beer
though
this
isnt
surprising
since
the
briny
effect
tends
to
fade
quickly
i
have
about
half
the
bottle
before
dinner
and
the
second
half
with
dinner
and
with
food
i
found
that
i
could
detect
just
the
faintest
trace
of
the
flat
earthiness
that
oysters
sometimes
impart
but
without
any
of
the
salt
sting
drank
most
of
the
bottle
myself
so
i
guess
that
would
make
it
quite
drinkable
absolutely
jet
black
in
color
nice
tight
cocoa
head
that
fades
way
too
fast
for
me
moderate
roasted
and
cocoa
aroma
big
roasted
flavor
without
being
too
astringent
deep
roasted
grain
taste
here
dark
chocolate
and
a
slight
mocha
tinge
no
sense
of
oysters
or
their
essence
though
i
could
see
the
connection
here
somewhat
briny
if
thats
not
too
far
a
reach
great
bodyreally
a
solid
mouthfeel
great
drinkabilityvery
well
rounded
and
balanced
could
do
this
one
all
nightearly
and
oftenjust
like
how
i
vote
d
good
but
heavy
wouldnt
want
to
drink
an
entire
bottle
well
it
was
an
experience
i
get
a
bit
queasy
thinking
about
gobs
of
oysters
going
into
the
brew
kettle
but
thanks
for
the
chance
to
try
it
first
oyster
stout
and
id
be
glad
to
try
more
while
the
taste
of
actual
oyster
may
sound
the
gross
the
saltiness
really
complements
the
sweet
coffee
and
oak
well
keeping
them
both
grounded
a
well
made
interesting
beer
overall
another
delicious
exit
series
beer
the
oysters
leave
a
unique
creamy
flavor
if
only
ff
would
make
their
exit
beers
year
round
they
would
become
a
more
sought
after
brewery
the
area
of
south
jersey
surrounding
exit
1
was
once
known
as
a
haven
for
oysters
and
that
reputation
has
recently
been
revived
a
truly
underappreciated
style
thanks
to
flying
fish
for
another
winner
cant
wait
to
see
what
waits
for
us
at
the
next
exit
dnot
bad
but
seems
kind
of
one
dimentional
lots
of
coffee
and
not
much
else
drinkability
very
nice
and
drinkable
i
dont
see
why
anyone
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
this
a
quality
stout
thats
super
roasty
and
goes
down
easy
this
is
definitely
not
a
sipping
beer
this
is
a
beer
for
drinking
over
and
over
during
a
long
evening
with
friends
or
by
yourself
it
doesnt
matter
try
this
beer
and
buy
a
few
you
wont
regret
it
drinkability
is
ok
i
had
a
tough
time
with
this
settling
in
the
belly
the
oyster
dryness
leaves
the
same
feeling
that
was
left
in
the
mouth
is
in
the
belly
did
not
sit
to
well
with
me
a
good
tasting
beer
but
definetley
not
a
session
for
me
body
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
soft
taste
with
a
great
bitterness
pretty
good
beer
not
great
but
pretty
good
deep
stout
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
hoppy
bite
in
the
beginning
middle
is
slightly
pleasant
and
the
after
taste
is
a
decent
stout
taste
pours
a
black
color
that
tries
its
best
not
to
let
any
light
through
mission
accomplished
head
is
light
coffee
colored
with
mini
craters
and
very
very
nice
lacing
left
behind
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
beans
very
pleasant
and
not
overpowering
taste
is
also
nice
with
a
great
blend
of
roasted
coffee
beans
and
bittersweet
chocolate
balance
is
nice
between
roast
flavors
coffee
chocolate
and
hops
good
carbonation
makes
this
stout
very
drinkable
with
a
good
kick
of
bitter
at
the
end
decent
balance
now
this
is
a
really
good
stout
it
might
even
be
great
but
ill
have
to
try
it
a
second
time
before
deciding
on
that
distinct
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
and
black
licorice
flavors
nicely
balanced
really
glad
i
found
this
one
as
it
will
make
a
nice
alternative
to
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
the
gold
standard
of
stouts
had
this
at
pike
and
it
was
very
good
could
drink
several
of
them
with
pleasure
feel
like
they
need
to
make
a
higher
abv
version
overall
this
is
a
very
good
brew
definitely
seek
this
one
out
no
light
is
getting
through
this
one
inky
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
the
head
dissipates
down
to
a
slight
disc
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
with
some
light
notes
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
the
taste
is
pure
dark
roasted
malt
it
has
a
nice
burnt
astringency
tempered
with
a
nice
earthy
hops
on
the
finish
it
has
a
good
weight
to
the
body
and
a
nice
silky
feel
on
the
palate
its
a
straightforward
rich
and
malty
stout
overall
very
enjoyable
recommended
o
this
one
took
me
by
surprise
i
like
it
a
lot
not
a
onehitwonder
lots
of
different
aspects
to
this
stout
rereview
december
2013
this
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
export
stouts
or
any
stout
really
its
kind
of
like
the
best
of
both
worlds
between
an
imperial
stout
and
a
regular
stout
pick
your
variety
dryirish
oatmeal
or
american
i
may
have
to
try
cloning
it
i
love
the
bold
dark
roast
flavors
the
slight
touch
of
burnt
a
good
flavor
for
me
in
the
right
quantities
and
the
touch
of
espresso
coffee
and
dark
semisweet
bakers
chocolate
im
not
sure
i
detect
anise
this
time
around
but
ill
leave
the
original
review
in
place
for
posterity
second
time
around
i
still
rate
this
one
very
high
in
fact
this
isnt
my
second
time
having
it
just
my
second
time
posting
a
review
one
of
pikes
most
tasty
regulars
a
wonderful
beer
especially
for
the
price
i
cant
remember
a
beer
that
tasted
this
good
for
the
value
i
will
certainly
purchase
more
of
these
a
perfect
beer
in
anticipation
of
thanksgiving
tomorrow
and
the
impending
cool
front
dropping
down
to
south
florida
smell
the
chocolate
taste
the
coffee
chocolate
has
that
raw
chocolate
aftertaste
a
totally
fine
pacific
northwest
beer
i
hope
they
can
get
thus
in
alaska
really
fine
for
a
cold
wrt
night
really
extra
stout
gonna
take
some
of
this
back
to
my
texas
friends
o
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
stout
alive
with
flavor
very
harsh
roasted
burnt
bitterness
with
a
hop
bite
at
first
quaff
dark
brown
bread
sweetness
on
the
aftertaste
the
roast
bitterness
continues
to
predominate
as
the
beer
warms
but
it
is
less
potent
this
may
explain
the
sweet
creamy
mouthfeel
this
one
improves
with
time
rjt
overall
solid
brew
all
the
way
around
the
hops
add
character
and
uniqueness
that
made
me
have
to
respect
it
that
and
i
enjoyed
it
recommend
for
sure
od
a
nice
stout
doesnt
do
too
much
to
hold
onto
you
but
it
seems
like
a
decent
example
of
the
style
i
have
to
admit
i
got
a
little
bored
with
it
after
the
first
glass
got
a
22
ounce
bottle
on
sale
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
small
amount
of
slightly
creamy
head
that
disappears
quickly
i
pick
up
the
roasted
malts
on
the
first
smell
second
i
come
up
with
a
little
bit
of
coffee
and
very
small
amount
of
black
licorice
not
too
strong
of
smell
but
i
am
definitely
interested
first
taste
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
with
a
very
drinkable
flavor
easy
to
pick
out
individual
malts
roasted
and
darker
caramel
malts
the
finishing
aftertaste
blends
all
the
flavors
and
ends
with
that
sweetness
and
then
hint
of
coffee
very
solid
brew
easy
drinking
with
tons
of
dark
malt
flavors
poured
into
a
glass
mug
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
and
falls
into
the
glass
as
a
jet
black
liquid
with
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
some
webbed
lacing
trails
behind
the
retreating
head
there
are
aromas
of
dark
roasted
malts
black
coffee
chocolate
and
a
little
prune
the
beer
is
very
roasty
in
flavor
from
the
dark
malts
i
get
that
coffee
and
prune
from
the
nose
but
also
a
little
licorice
i
only
get
a
touch
of
chocolate
there
but
it
isnt
much
the
body
is
full
and
creamy
the
roasty
aftertaste
lingers
in
the
mouth
and
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
the
beer
drinks
fairly
easily
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
smooth
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
you
like
your
stouts
very
roasty
this
one
is
for
you
a
great
tasting
stout
that
has
a
nice
yet
unexpected
northwest
hoppiness
to
it
o
a
very
nice
stout
overall
has
great
roasty
flavors
and
a
nice
creamy
milky
feel
highly
drinkable
and
well
worth
trying
great
stout
let
this
one
almost
get
to
room
temperature
before
cracking
into
i
think
that
is
vital
to
do
the
darker
the
beer
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
o
another
winner
from
pike
these
guys
dont
get
enough
exposure
in
the
beer
community
imo
would
love
to
have
this
on
nitro
pour
andor
cask
overall
an
allaround
solid
stout
o
pretty
good
stout
the
mouthfeel
could
have
been
a
bit
smoother
and
warmer
in
summary
i
can
see
why
this
is
one
of
the
more
highlyrated
export
stouts
on
this
website
it
blends
slightly
higher
than
usual
hopping
with
clean
and
dry
black
coffee
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
blueberry
fruitiness
over
a
really
nice
texture
without
relying
upon
acridness
as
the
sole
source
of
bitterness
the
only
criticism
i
can
muster
is
that
the
hopping
presented
to
the
palate
isnt
as
noticeable
as
it
could
be
in
the
nose
overall
a
very
well
done
export
stout
beautiful
appearance
backed
by
simple
but
bold
and
very
enjoyable
flavors
o
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
definitley
drink
it
again
while
i
didnt
care
for
the
smell
to
much
it
made
up
for
it
in
taste
from
the
22
oz
bottle
label
on
this
version
says
6
6
and
65
ibu
o
one
of
the
better
mainline
offerings
from
pike
a
pretty
solid
export
stout
overall
not
a
bad
stout
for
the
price
tag
nothing
really
different
about
this
one
that
makes
it
stand
out
aside
from
the
slightly
hopped
up
taste
well
well
well
this
is
excellently
well
done
creamy
and
smoothe
light
carbonation
balanced
perfectly
well
with
only
a
minimal
alcohol
aftertaste
definitely
one
of
my
favourite
representations
of
this
style
which
happens
to
be
one
of
my
favourite
styles
i
will
be
picking
up
a
couple
more
to
bring
back
to
texas
with
me
this
is
a
stoutlovers
stout
none
of
this
stout
as
dessert
nonsense
here
its
not
exceptionally
heavy
its
not
sweet
at
all
but
it
manages
to
pull
everything
together
in
a
coherent
if
forthright
whole
great
stuff
so
drink
at
your
own
discretion
poured
into
new

globe
glass
appearance
is
black
opaque
and
viscous
with
a
velvety
layer
of
brown
head
which
retains
nicely
the
nose
starts
with
deep
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
smokiness
this
is
paired
with
molasses
and
fig
the
taste
is
roasty
and
dry
up
front
and
develops
a
nice
hop
bitterness
towards
the
finish
almost
no
sweetness
which
is
a
surprise
to
me
considering
how
malty
it
is
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
the
appearance
suggests
but
is
appropriate
for
the
gravity
of
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
nice
full
flavored
stout
with
a
bit
of
unique
character
it
leans
towards
the
dry
side
with
almost
no
sweetness
which
is
unlike
most
stouts

only
a

noticed
after

quite
smooth

but
is
still
a
bit
of
a
sipper
overall
this
is
a
really
excellent

stout
great
flavor
balance
with
hoppiness
and
quite
smooth
to
sip
on
with
big
robust
flavors
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
slightly
gritty
texture
overall
very
pleasing
beer
o
very
good
stout
as
far
as
regular
stouts
go
nothing
crazy
or
eccentric
about
this
beer
just
a
stout
with
good
flavor
and
aroma
would
drink
this
again
if
i
ever
get
another
chance
yeah
i
reckon
pike
made
and
continues
to
make
a
fine
foreign
extra
stout
good
on
them
nothing
off
about
this
beer
it
is
a
vision
of
stout
that
seems
focused
on
bitterness
and
color
poured
in
a
goblet
and
developed
a
one
half
inch
head
good
lacing
all
around
the
glass
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
hit
my
nose
the
taste
is
as
if
i
am
drinking
strong
unsweetened
coffee
with
chocolate
added
i
like
it
it
leaves
a
bitter
after
taste
that
some
might
dislike
hog
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
solid
package
that
is
worth
the
price
of
admission
i
think
i
picked
this
up
for
something
like
5
bucks
while
traveling
something
pretty
much
unheard
of
in
pa
i
would
get
this
again
if
the
opportunity
presented
itself
it
is
a
solid
take
on
the
style
solid
stout
overall
that
i
would
revisit
again
and
again
purchased
a
bottle
back
in
2009
and
have
had
in
my
cellar
until
this
evening
drinking
it
tonight
to
celebrate
two
years
of
home
ownership
poured
into
a
great
divide
yeti
stout
tulip
glass
dark
brown
colored
body
with
a
medium
sized
mocha
colored
head
the
head
dissipated
soon
but
left
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
there
was
a
pleasant
smell
of
smoke
and
bakers
chocolate
taste
was
very
inviting
lots
of
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
cake
and
root
beer
at
first
though
this
beer
left
a
somewhat
too
harsh
bitter
coating
on
my
palate
but
as
the
beer
warmed
up
to
almost
near
room
temp
that
seemed
to
fade
away
there
was
a
nice
and
creamy
mouthfeel
at
the
end
this
beer
held
up
nicely
for
almost
two
years
in
the
beer
cellar
and
it
would
be
worth
purchasing
more
at
this
low
price
point
overall
a
nice
solid
stout
for
a
chilly
rainy
night
in
seattle
my
only
complaint
was
that
because
the
higher
alcohol
level
i
couldnt
have
more
than
one
and
still
drive
home
that
night
o
overall
one
of
pikes
better
offerings
id
say
a
great
dessertnightcapcold
day
kind
of
beer
taste
like
the
nose
is
smokey
and
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
come
through
as
w
ll
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
with
a
light
finish
drank
this
brew
last
night
with
a
buddy
i
aquired
it
from
a
trade
from
a
very
kind
girl
on
the
other
wedsite
she
throw
this
one
in
as
an
extra
and
boy
am
i
happy
she
did
this
beer
was
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
darkness
snifter
it
pours
a
motor
oil
black
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
this
beer
looks
super
thick
and
smells
great
like
chocolate
and
dried
fuits
after
about
a
minute
the
head
finally
subsided
enough
to
drink
it
the
smell
and
the
look
was
gerat
but
the
taste
was
just
ok
i
was
expecting
a
big
robust
beer
and
it
was
kinda
on
the
lighter
side
the
mouthfeel
was
good
nothing
too
exciting
but
still
an
over
all
good
drinking
brew
however
you
view
it
this
is
a
delicious
stout
that
would
make
a
great
treat
for
dessert
or
even
to
make
custom
chocolate
sauce
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
nice
two
finger
mocha
brown
head
head
lasted
10
minutes
or
so
before
leaving
some
random
clinging
on
the
sides
remaining
head
clung
well
but
slid
back
down
quickly
aroma
was
strongly
of
a
milky
slightly
dark
chocolate
with
small
hints
of
an
oaky
wood
in
the
back
flavor
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
tail
end
of
bitter
predominant
was
a
slightly
watered
down
milky
chocolate
not
a
bad
flavor
but
a
bit
understated
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
well
and
perfectly
carbonated
a
very
mellow
well
balanced
sip
overall
a
decent
stout
i
have
had
better
for
the
price
but
not
a
bad
beer
o
wantaway
stout
that
remains
local
because
of
its
illperceived
stance
in
a
relatively
competitive
category
average
stout
tastes
good
nothing
amazing
but
solid
beer
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
enjoyable
to
drink
problem
is
it
reminds
me
of
50
other
stouts
sitting
on
the
shelf
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
as
a
special
beer
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
the
brewery
was
a
pretty
neat
place
overall
it
packs
a
nice
amount
of
flavor
for
a
single
stout
this
pours
dark
thick
jet
black
motor
oil
with
a
fat
creamy
dark

that
sticks
around

of

the
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
robust
coffee
bitter
dark
chocolate
and

the
taste
follows
with

flavor
in
the
middle
finishes
dry
with
a
mouthfull
of
earthy
and
floral
hops
balanced
with
a
roasty
after
breath
nicely
balanced
creamy
and
thick
on
the
mouth
simple
dry
and
balanced
stout
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
a
session
beer
at
7
abv
a
22oz
bomber
goes
down
very
easily
enjoi
overall
i
think
this
style
gets
overlooked
and
quite
often
overly
complicated
pike
did
a
perfect
job
of
brewing
a
very
solid
american
stout
too
often
the
abv
hops
additional
flavors
etc
etc
try
to
complicate
an
already
great
style
pike
kept
it
simple
and
perfect

done
not
very
black

is
quite
upfront

not
unpleasant

sort
of
flavor
nice
mouthfeelprety
much
in
line
for
the
style
and
abv
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
at
only
7
i
have
not
seen
pike
beers
for
several
years
and
for
the
asking
price
this
is
a
great
beer
looking
forward
to
the
next
one
in
my
fridge
good
beer
pike
look
forward
to
trying
others
on

quite

well
done
stout
o
american
style
stouts
have
taken
awhile
to
become
my
favorite
style
and
it
has
taken
awhile
for
it
to
be
a
style
that
ive
leaned
to
be
a
favorable
beverage
of
choice
when
it
comes
to
beers
this
however
brings
something
different
to
the
american
style
and
you
know
i
appreciate
the
effort
so
if
given
the
chance
i
will
purchase
it
again
good
beer
for
its
style
overall
a
tasty
beer
try
one
if
you
can
i
can
see
this
brewery
comin
up
it
was
typical
in
the
mouth
and
medium
bodied
this
brew
falls
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
as
far
as
stouts
go
no
greatness
or
unique
characteristics
to
be
had
though
nothing
out
of
whack
either
overall
this
was
a
very
drinkable
and
very
smooth

roasted
and
charred
finish
on
top
of
a
thin
moderatelycarbonated
dry
and
chalky
body
easy
enough
to
drink
but
too
light
harsh
and
acidic
for
a
full
recommendation
the
beer
is
a
bit
lighter
than
i
expected
but
it
still
has
a
good
medium
body
and
a
slightly
creamy
texture
the
flavors
are
smoke
roasted
and
burnt
malt
coffee
it
then
transitions
to
lots
of
dark
roasted
malts
with
a
sweet
cream
character
the
finish
introduces
some
bitter
flavors
from
the
hops
and
the
aftertaste
is
like
a
heavily
creamed
darkroast
coffee
a
really
good
stout
skål
basically
it
blew
me
away
because
the
classic
deep
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
was
there
but
was
so
easy
to
drink
pours
a
thick
pitch
black
with
a
nice
2
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
a
small
cap
nice
foamy
lacing
all
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smells
of
roasted
malt
coffee
beans
cocoa
powder
and
faint
whiffs
of
alcohol
tastes
of
bittersweet
chocolate
strong
espresso
and
an
earthy
grain
taste
there
is
a
strong
bitter
astringency
after
each
sip
good
carbonation
with
a
medium
body
creamy
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
but
the
bitterness
is
pronounced
and
detracts
from
the
beer
in
my
opinion
o
quite
drinkable
alone
or
with
food
well
i
must
say
this
is
a
good
beer
not
familiar
with
the
brand
but
hey
good
none
the
less
overall
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
and
i
was
delivered
a
smoky
porkbacon
dry
bitter
mess
not
sure
why
people
like
consuming
these
flavors
in
beer
anyway
not
recommended
compared
to
the
numerous
better
available
styles
available
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
and
i
look
forward
to
future
brews
from
pike
street
surprisingly
given
the
color
and
smell
it
is
surprisingly
light
in
terms
of
body
leading
to
it
being
fairly
drinkable
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint

the
beer
pours
a
thick
viscous
jetblack
color
with
a
thin
dense
tan
colored
head
that
has
great
retention
as
you
drink
the
nose
is
strong
in
coffee
and
chocolate
while
you
are
pouring
as
well
as
when
you
smell
from
the
glass
the
flavors
are
dark
roast
coffee
bitter
with
a
blend
of
milk
chocolate
the
flavors
are
carried
on
a
light
dry

coffee
aftertaste
with
a
bitter
essence
left
in

the
finish
is
smooth

lingering
delicious
makes
a
tasty

brownie
also
definitely
a
must
buy
and
must
drink
i
havent
had
anything
else
from
pike
but
this
would
make
me
like
to
try
others
i
only
wish
it
was
cooler
inside
so
i
could
enjoy
it
more
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
d
in
the
new
realm
of
bomber
pricing
being
able
to
get
a
beer
at
this
abv
and
quality
for
under
4
is
a
steal
it
looks
like
pike
may
be
coming
into
ca
into
a
big
way
and
if
they
offer
deals
like
this
ill
be
buying
it
reminds
me
a
ton
of
deschutes

if
you
like
that

be
a
fan

taste

and
lingering
forever
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
good
as
this
beer
warmed
up
the
bitterness
was
a
little
much
for
my
tastes
overall
solid
brew
and
would
enjoy
another
pint
in
the
future
d
on
the
whole
a
well
done
drinkable
stout
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
plan
on
stocking
up
to
keep
this
stuff
on
hand
remarkably
drinkable
for
the
style
mine

abv
though
this
was
a
tough
one
to
mark
there
is
now
such
a
plethora
of
flavourful
charismatic
stouts
on
the
market
that
i
can
sometimes
take
them
for
granted
this
may
have
been
one
such
occasion
nonetheless
while
it
may
not
have
warranted
top
scores
it
is
a
beer
fully
deserving
of
praise
recognition
and
most
definitely
a
repeat
purchase
quite
a
good
beer
and
for
the
price
this
nearly
cannot
be
beat
d
its
drinkable
just
nothing
too
exciting
and
i
am
going
to
be
bored
with
it
before
i
finish
this
bomber
this
beer
is
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
with
a
dry
finish
id
gladly
open
another

i
had

must

something

some

the

the

not

are
dark

very
noticeable

a
very
nice

runs
right
through

an
excellent
stout
d
i
remember
going
to
the
brewpub
in
seattle
about
four
years
ago
and
had
this
on
tap
im
glad
we
get
stuff
from
pike
out
here
now
because
its
cheap
it
is
all
solid
and
i
now
get
to
relive
a
bit
of
nostalgia
from
my
past
d
its
solid
and
serviceable
thats
about
it
had
this
last
night
and
what
a
wonderful
stout
it
was
poured
the
typical
black
and
left
a
1
5
finger
dark
tan
head
smelled
awesome
big
malt
roasty
scents
of
smoke
with
a
touch
of
molasses
taste
was
beautiful
smokey
roasted
malt
bordering
on
the
taste
of
burnt
malt
with
hints
of
coffee
and
molasses
finishing
of
with
a
smooooth
finish
of
a
touch
of
hops
that
lingered
on
the
palate
along
with
the
coffee
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
at
7
the
alcohol
was
not
noticed
but
it
made
its
presence
known
on
an
empty
stomach
pours
a
blackish
body
with
large
light
brown
head
that
dies
slow
and
leaves
lace
a
malty
mixture
of
black
chocolate
caramel
bread
roasted
and
coffee
along
w
hints
of
toffee
and
wood
all
are
in
the
aroma
a
real
malty
taste
much
like
aroma
as
a
thinner
smoother
creamier
stout
passes
over
tongue
than
expected
but
still
packs
a
sweet
taste
chocolate
caramel
vanilla
and
possibly
figs
or
molasses
seem
to
pass
my
tongue
as
well
as
roasted
bread
and
wood
notes
so
this
is
a
balanced
stout
that
has
a
sweetness
and
finishes
dry
just
a
wellcrafted
sipper
w
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
but
a
great
sipper
that
i
relaxed
with
smooth
richfull
body
with
a
taste
that
lasted
and
was
very
enjoyable
i
should
bought
more
of
these
when
i
was
on
vacation
since
they
are
unavailable
in
ohio
smooth
with
a
rich
mediumfull
body
with
a
light
upfront
effervescence
a
somewhat
warming
brew
with
a
drying
finish
a
smoky
toasty
malt
aftertaste
lingers
for
a
long
while
as
does
the
slight
coating
of
the
tongue
a
very
nice
beer
all
22
oz
of
it
notes
a
nice
export
stout
but
i
dont
think
it
stands
up
to
guinness
foreign
or
cisco
capt
swains
i
like
this
beer
but
im
not
wowed
by
it
it
tastes
like
every
other
extra
stout
ive
ever
had
i
dare
say
that
most
people
would
have
a
huge
problem
trying
to
decide
what
is
what
in
a
contest
between
pikes
and
guinness
extra
stout
nonetheless
it
is
a
good
solid
beer
and
ill
buy
it
again
this
is
a
real
delight
id
like
to
have
another
half
dozen
to
sample
at
three
month
intervals
but
certainly
interesting
enough
now
and
one
to
savour
and
take
ones
time
to
enjoy
cheers
drinkability
is
actually
quite
good
im
suitably
impressed
by
this
stout
didnt
go
into
it
expecting
much
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
a
respectable
abv
and
a
pleasing
flavor
make
this
a
great
beer
to
share
with
friends
d
very
drinkable
would
be
able
to
drink
this
fast
and
very
recommendable
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
with
light
carbonation
and
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
complexity
is
definitely
not
needed
in
this
beer
as
the
flavors
were
readily
identifiable
and
tasted
well
throughout
if
this
is
available
around
you
this
bottle
is
easily
a
candidate
for
a
nice
session
we
all
enjoyed
this
one
pretty
well
exxxcellent

when
you
review
this

typing

xs
in

just

in

beer
and
hit
review
it
wont
save
wont
let
me
anyway
only
comes
out
as
three
xs
the
hell
of
it
all
i
tell
ya
had
a
bomber
of
this
with
my
dinner
at
the
local
vietnamese
place
paired
pretty
well
with
my
beef
and
bok
choy
dish
that
was
very
spicy
one
of
the
better
foreignexport
stouts
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
a
meaty
stout
tons
of
strong
flavor
and
some
subtle
flavors
very
drinkable
the
coffee
and
chocolate
are
wellbalanced
and
offset
by
just
enough
sweetness
to
keep
the
bitterness
in
check
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
chewy
a
very
drinkable
stout
this
was
a
bargain
when
i
bought
it
in
va
i
should
have
bought
more
excellent
beer
the
unveiling
revealed
pike
street
xxx
street
stout
never
even
heard
of
these
guys
awesome
this
was
staring
me
in
the
face
as
i
entered
tw
in
the
pines
today
in
fact
it
was
among
a
cornucopia
of
pike
bombers
this
is
one
that
i
picked
up
lets
give
it
a
whirl
for
starters
the
7
abv
has
me
fired
up
popping
the
top
i
get
a
delicious
smell
of
roasted
malts
notes
of
cinnamon
and
some
black
licorice
like
alcohol
smells
pouring
into
a
trusty
pint
this
brew
pours
like
motor
oil
jet
black
and
thick
with
high
viscosity
in
the
pint
it
is
as
black
as
night
with
a
substantial
foamy
tan
head
there
is
not
a
speck
of
light
coming
through
this
brew
on
the
taste
the
first
standout
is
the
mouthfeel
thick
and
smooth
like
motor
oil
not
that
ive
actually
dranken
motor
oil
but
just
like
it
poured
the
taste
itself
is
a
very
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
cinnamon
and
black
licorice
flavor
in
the
middle
just
as
the
smell
lead
to
believe
very
mildly
bitter
only
slightly
sweet
very
roasted
and
finishes
tarty
this
would
be
great
on
a
cold
day
very
hearty
and
robust
with
lots
of
body
a
solid
brew
for
the
price
at
tw
a
steal
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
d
not
much
to
look
at
and
nose
is
rather
plain
but
this
one
is
a
hidden
gem
for
sure
feel
and
taste
are
incredible
very
smooth
with
good
complexity
worth
a
try
drinkability
overall
a
pretty
decent
deal
i
think
i
paid
3
99
for
this
at
total
wine
for
an
decent
beer
nothing
earthshattering
but
really
solid
salud
very
nice
very
robust
stout
big
aroma
and
flavor
on
this
one
love
this
beer
been
staring
at
it
for
year
and
never
bought
it
what
a
fool
ive
been
highly
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
glad
it
is
a
bomber
try
this
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
with
a
big
brown
head
with
strong
retention
aromas
are
predominately
sweet
with
dark
chocolate
and
toffee
notes
followed
in
the
strength
by
roastier
notes
rather
mochalike
taste
is
considerably
more
bitter
although
its
initially
sweet
before
showing
assertive
roasty
and
charred
elements
and
finishing
with
strong
espresso
flavors
that
grow
in
bitterness
as
they
linger
body
is
quite
smooth
and
a
pleasure
to
swish
around
id
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
stouts
on
the
more
bitter
end
of
the
spectrum
rather
nice

at

a

this
stuff
is

a

its
hard
to
find

unspectacular
stout
d
refreshing

and
surprisingly
affordable
this
may
become
a
new
standby

in
my
arsenal
d
a
nice
roasty
drinkable
export
stout
which
rings
in
just
around
7
abv
the
alcohol
is
not
detected
in
the
strength
of
the
stout
which
is
propelled
by
that
nice

balancing

bitterness
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
and
would
like
to
try
it
beside
a
gingerbread

or
flank

unfortunately
i
didnt
take
notes
when
i
tried
this
on

i
cannot
complain
about
this
being

expectations
very
pleased
with
this
selection
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
would
also
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
full
bodied

finishes
sweet
not
bad
not
great
d
this
was
not
a
bad
stout
but
it
smelled
much
better
than
it
tasted
alcohol
wasnt
detectable
but
the
aftertaste
wasnt
very
pleasant
so
it
was
only
somewhat
easy
to
drink
good
not
great
d
this
beer
is
pretty
subdued
for
its
style
and
could
be
very
drinkable
for
me
if
it
wasnt
for
the
offputting
bitterness
i
will
have
to
pick
up
another
one
of
these
and
update
my
review
to
see
if
i
just
got
an
offflavored
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
not
great
just
good
and
none
the
worse
for
it
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
an
evening
and
feel
thoroughly
satisfied
i
like
it
d
great
really
presents
the
best
qualities
of
the
style
without
feeling
too
heavy
it
has
a
silky
mouthfeel
but
not
too
sweet
and
is
incredibly
drinkable
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
with
a
pepperoni
pizza
although
sweet
this
is
still
an
extremely
drinkable
stout
with
a
wellmasked
abv
a
nice
american
stab
at
the
foreignexport
stout
drinkability
good
overall
stout
and
best
beer
of
their
lineup
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
rich
oily
opaque
sable
with
a
thick
and
fairly
persistent
finebubbled
tan
mead
aroma
is
rich
and
smoky
with
firm
tones
of
quality
coffee
and
brown
sugar
most
inviting
flavor
is
even
better
than
the
aroma
richly
of
roast
fine
coffee
unsweet
chocolate
and
molasses
the
flavors
i
like
best
in
a
stout
it
is
only
slightly
sweet
and
has
a
touch
of
bitterness
texture
is
thick
smooth
oily
and
tingly
this
is
one
lipsmacking
stout
worth
seeking
nice
solid
stout
to
put
your
hands
around
even
by
the
pint
this
one
wasnt
hard
to
put
down
a
very
nice
end
to
a
good
seattle
evening
drinkability
good
this
is
one
i
would
try
again
poured
into
a
new
belgium
goblet
black
with
a
one
fingered
tan
head
minimal
lacing
scents
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
not
much
of
a
hop
presence
in
the
taste
mostly
smokey
dark
chocolate
with
nutty
flavors
on
the
back
end
of
the
palatte
there
isnt
a
presence
of
alcohol
which
makes
this
a
good
drinkable
stout
d
not
bad
not
overwhelmed
but
this
was
nice
would
try
again
taste
licorice
is
more
restrained
coffee
dominates
sweet
hoppy
bitter
chocolate
more
on
the
palate
than
in
the
nose
dry
good
mouthfeel
everything
sticks
drinkable
but
a
little
pricey
d
very
drinkable
i
could
and
would
put
down
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
i
had
the
chance
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
a
bunch
of
roasted
malts
coffee
sweet
chocolate
a
hint
of
charred
wood
and
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
flavor
is
roasted
malts
sweet
chocolate
citrus
and
a
hint
of
smoke
mouthfeel
is
full
to
medium
creamy
with
a
dry
and
heavy
bitter
finish
good
stout
pretty
enjoyable
stout
especially
for
the
price
tag
not
all
that
complex
but
very
drinkable
and
a
good
argument
for
more
export
stouts
solid
pour
with
a
black
slightly
viscous
body
and
a
relatively
thin
head
smells
quite
roasty
and
with
a
heady
dose
of
licorice
as
well
as
a
slightly
mentholated
aroma
satisfyingly
deep
and
roasty
in
the
flavor
department
with
some
fruity
vinous
notes
as
well
quite
pleasant
and
on
the
roastier
side
of
balanced
quite
smooth
and
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
beer
overall
a
great
beer
right
here
not
my
fav
style
but
this
makes
me
enjoy
it
d
this
went
down
easily
at
6
6
its
not
too
strong
but
it
probably
wouldnt
make
the
best
session
beer
on
the
plus
side
i
would
bet
that
if
you
took
your
time
you
could
make
a
bomber
or
two
of
this
last
awhile
d
a
very
solid
stout
with
a
nice
flavor
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
its
worth
trying
for
sure
and
doesnt
break
the
bank
an
excellent
stout
exactly
what
im
looking
for
coffee
and
roastiness
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
my
only
qualm
being
the
body
is
a
little
thin
could
just
more
of
it
other
than
that
a
stout
i
could
drink
all
night
love
it
this
brew
is
top
notch
this
is
a
very
good
export
stout
and
i
like
the
hop
presence
thrown
in
for
added
complexity
drinkability
very
good
but
not
exactly
sessionable
i
think
with
a
little
tweaking
of
the
flavor
i
think
i
would
be
able
to
handle
a
couple
of
these
in
a
row
my
pint
looked
pretty
delicious
very
dark
with
a
creamy
tan
head
and
a
few
larger
bubbles
dotting
the
top
of
the
beer
great
head
retention
plenty
of
lace
nice
aroma
sweet
and
roasty
with
a
bit
of
leafy
hops
toffee
and
chocolate
moderate
citrus
bitterness
up
front
balanced
well
with
the
sweetness
more
caramel
chocolate
and
roast
midpalate
lingering
hop
bitterness
a
bit
stronger
than
i
expected
full
bodied
with
no
alcohol
presence
lowish
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
great
stuff
and
it
went
quite
well
with
bbq
drinkability
this
beer
is
so
heavy
its
hard
to
drink
the
whole
22oz
which
is
pretty
much
the
point
of
extra
stout
brews
no
alcohol
hotness
detectable
at
all
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
like
a
chocolate
cake
in
liquid
form
a
great
stout
worth
multiple
purchases
a
very
good
stout
something
i
would
recommend
silky
chewy
viscous
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
bitter
dark
chocolate
oatmeal
toffee
biscuit
roasted
coffee
bean
and
a
huge
bitter
earthy
hop
flavor
with
some
citrus
notes
this
is
way
hoppier
than
expected
and
kind
of
takes
away
from
the
silky
maltiness
that
i
liked
so
much
the
finish
is
long
and
dry
with
some
citrus
notes
but
mostly
earthy
bitter
hops
dominate
well
masked
abv
and
smooth
maltiness
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
but
the
strong
hop
presence
kind
of
hurts
it
in
this
area
full
mouthfeel
but
finishes
tannic
with
a
puckery
linger
which
detracts
overall
hope
to
find
some
more
pike
trade
d
i
am
pleased
to
say
im
impressed
in
factovertly
so
i
was
expecting
a
good
beer
not
a
great
beer
and
i
got
a
motherfuing
bad
assed
beer
great
black
color
with
a
dark
brown
head
containing
different
shades
of
caramel
hues
good
lace
and
powerful
taste
after
an
above
average
black
malty
roasty
chocolatecoffee
head
taste
is
very
satisfying
with
roasted
barley
and
black
malt
giving
birth
to
the
supreme
espresso
but
mostly
dark
chocolate
flavor
that
is
bitter
from
the
semisweet
chocolate
and
also
from
the
hops
i
just
now
bumped
the
smell
to
a
4
5
because
every
time
i
go
to
take
a
drink
the
smell
hits
my
nose
first
like
a
beer
containing
nanotechnology
designed
to
offer
the
perfect
beer
tasting
experience
im
close
to
giving
taste
a
5
fantastic
mouthfeel
that
is
heavy
chewy
silky
and
creamy
at
once
bitterness
like
that
which
this
beer
offers
only
makes
the
finish
much
longer
and
allows
the
outstanding
stout
character
to
linger

often

a

nothing
screams

at
you
but
this
is
one
wellbrewed
beer
d
this
was
a
really
good
beer
but
the
mouthfeel
did
not
really
do
this
beer
justice

this
was

could

this

definitely
the
best
version
of
a
foreignexport
stout
ive
had
to
date
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
an
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
a
good
inch
or
so
of
creamy
dark
tan
head
the
foam
wont
quit
lasting
nearly
the
entire
glass
and
leaving
small
wisps
of
lacing
behind
with
each
sip
aromas
and
flavors
consist
of
rich
dark
roasted
grains
cocoa
bakers
chocolate
mocha
roasted
coffee
caramel
and
even
some
vanilla
approaching
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
more
than
ample
carbonation
very
nice
note
my
bottle
states

very
basic
brew

interesting
enough
to
go
through

medium

is
well
carbonated
but
a
bit
light
in
the
finish
perhaps
not
as
flashy
or
extreme
as
some
other
imperials
but
just
a
genuinely
good
drinkable
stout
was
an
alright
beer
for
sure
not
ranking
in
any
top
categories
for
me
but
i
wasnt
pissed
by
any
means
drinking
it
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
too
easy
excellent
flavor
excellent
beer
this
beer
doesnt
screw
around
with
hops
or
complimentary
malts
it
just
gives
you
a
big
blast
of
roasted
malt
yet
it
is
not
overdone
oharas
celebration
stout
is
similar
yet
it
is
harsh
and
in
fact
overdone
very
affordable
in
alberta
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
on
my
next
trip
completely
opaque
with
a
nice
sized
head
looks
like
a
big
stout
should
each
time
i
took
a
whiff
the
smell
waffled
between
sweetbready
and
roasted
bitterness
there
are
65
ibus
in
this
thing
and
they
show
up
in
the
flavor
it
is
sweet
up
front
but
there
is
plenty
of
bitterness
here
both
from
the
roasted
and
charred
malts
and
the
loads
of
hops
present
firm
yet
smooth
mouthfeel
with
perfect
carbonation
it
sat
too
heavy
in
my
gut
and
i
felt
the
alcohol
too
much
for
a
good
drinkability
score
but
if
its
just
one
this
is
a
great
beer
3
99
for
a
22oz
of
a
full
flavored
stout
thats
7
abv
you
can
do
the
math
for
a
beer
baron
on
a
budget
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
out
there
this
is
an
enticing
stout
and
it
draws
me
in
completely
the
bottle
feels
solid
in
my
hand
when
it
splashes
in
docile
tones
into
the
pint
glass
it
sounds
and
looks
well
crafted
with
an
opaque
brown
color
and
an
inch
of
creamy
brown
head
which
stays
together
for
most
of
the
sampling
the
aroma
erupts
with
smoky
chocolate
malts
in
the
tradition
of
a
good
imperial
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
and
strong
the
taste
tickles
the
palate
with
coffee
chocolate
and
fresh
hops
an
impressive
extra
stout
taste
is
thick

creamy

a

stout
on

for
the
style
so
no

other
alcohol
presence
is
evident
if
i
had
to
cite
a
negative
i
think
a
bit
more
body
and
creaminess
would
make
this
a
really
outstanding
brew
very
drinkable
and
with
relatively
low
abv
could
be
good

more
than
one

for

solid
version
of
a
foreign
stout
pours
deep
dark

with
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
is
more
sweet
and
fruity
than
anticipated
with
some
caramel
and
roastiness
as
well
the
taste
is
very
bold
a
big
malty
forefront
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
that
is
followed
by
some
very
noticeable
hop
bitterness
it
ends
crisp
with
some
lingering
brown
sugar
and
ash
taste
in
a
good
way
which
definitely
has
you
coming
back
for
more
the
mouthfeel
could
be
heavier

the
carbonation
is
appropriate
a
pleasant
experience
overall
this
beer
poured

with
the
sweetness
of

on
the

i
expected
this
to
be
a
thick
heavy
beer
and
it
wasnt
body
lends
to
be
a
bit
on
the
heavier
side
of
a
medium
bodied
beer
but
not
extremely
filling
decent
carbonation
chewy
mouthfeel
in
the
middle
with
a
nice
dry

i
could
sit
with
a
few
of
these
on
any

evening
this
beer
pours
a
totally
opaque
motor
oil
black
with
a
copious
amount
of
foamy
light
tan
head
that
leaves
lacing
around
the
glass
as
it
recedes

the
carbonation
is
quite
muted

with
a
medium
weight
it
finishes
dry
and
smooth
with
a
note
of
mocha
lingering
i
quite
enjoyed
this
big
flavors
but
not
too
heavy
in
body
or
abv
to
slow
down
my
rapidly
increasing
pace
d
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
a
dry
bitter
stout
similar
to
a
dry
london
porter
not
my
particular
taste
for
mass
consumption
but
it
seems
to
hold
its
own
in
that
particular
flavour
profile
roasty
coffee
flavor
is
balanced
by
dark
fruitiness
licorice
and
a
fair
amount
of
floral
hop
bitterness
a
touch
of
alcohol
in
the
throat
makes
this
a
pretty
tasty
foreign
style
stout
mouthfeel
is
fine
for
a
stout
and
the
drinkability
is
easier
because
the
mouthfull
isnt
that
heavy
an
interesting
take
on
the
stoutxstout
style
and
i
rather
liked
it
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
with
the
weight
of
it
i
could
maybe
only
handle
three
at
a
time
definitely
recommended
if
your
in
the
area
i
brought
this
back
from
a
recent
trip
to
seattle
and
very
glad
i
did
this
comes
across
as
being
a
very
big
beer
but
stays
a
bit
more
drinkable
than
the
risdouble
stouts
out
the
by
not
being
too
high
in
abv
even
nicer
than
i
had
hoped
for
pours
a
black
colored
body
watery
looking
with
a
tan
head
some
good
lacing
has
a
strong
aroma
of
some
coffee
with
some
bitter
coffee
grounds
has
a
coffee
taste
some
chocolate
bitter
chocolate
pretty
rough
for
me
appearance
looks
to
be
a
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
thick
creamy
firm
brown
head
with
nice
lace
smell
of
sweet
dark
malts
chocolate
molassas
and
dark
fruits
taste
of
strong
coffee
molassas
roasted
malts
and
the
hoppiness
balances
nicely
with
the
flavor
mouthfeel
seem
viscous
going
down
slick
with
a
roasted
malt
bitter
bite
at
the
end
robust
is
a
good
word
for
this
one
d
all
around
nice
and
worth
the
buy
i
picked
up
mine
at
the
belmont
station
and
am
very
happy
with
my
purchase
this
easily
makes
it
into
my
large
group
of
timetotime
regulars
put
on
the
snappy
pants
for
this
one
i
am
sampling
a
cellar
temp
bottle
of
this
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
thin
tan
surface
layer
of
head
aroma
is
roasted
malt
and
almost
smokey
mixing
with
some
brown
sugar
and
maybe
molasses
as
well
no
real
hop
presence
or
abv
hints
either
first
sip
reveals
a
thick
body
with
very
fine
and
fizzy
carbonation
tight
clingy
lattice
on
the
glass
after
each
sip
flavor
is
dry
roasted
malt
almost
coffee
bean
and
some
general
sweetness
my
palate
dries
out
after
each
sip
again
the
hops
dont
show
up
at
all
which
is
okay
considering
the
style
no
hints
on
abv
either
the
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
but
only
due
to
the
body
not
any
booziness
a
well
crafted
robust
brew
poured
from
growler
into
bubble
pint
glass
poured
with
thick
rich
firm
deep
tan
head
solid
head
left
thick
attractive
lacing
solid
black
color
pleasantly
rich
aromas
flavor
follows
aroma
closely
with
the
roasty
toasty
goodness
being
everything
you
would
hope
for
the
body
and
mouthfeel
are
what
is
expected
from
a
great
stout
the
reason
i
didnt
rate
this
beer
higher
is
that
it
is
so
good
i
feel
it
rates
well
against
imperial
stouts
i
know
its
inaccurate
to
do
this
but
this
stout
has
earned
the
comparisons
drink
this
beer
pikes
xxx
stout
quickly
launches
into
a
rich
tapestry
of
roasted
aromas
converging
on
cacao
coffee
and
barley
grain
it
imparts
a
sweet
malty
flavor
with
ample
roasted
grain
on
a
coal
black
body
this
is
a
worthy
stout
of
pronounced
roastiness
though
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
a
nitro
pour
might
deliver
the
final
touch
of
grace
in
smoothing
out
the
body
the
excess
sweetness
kills
the
drinkability
to
me
i
love
the
look
and
the
nice
bitterness
mixed
with
sweet
taste
but
the
finish
is
way
to
sugary
for
me
i
want
a
beer
that
i
feel
compelled
to
drink
more
then
one
of
great
flavors
but
a
poor
finish
d
if
i
could
get
this
one
it
would
be
one
i
drank
regularly
a
good
hoppy
americanstyle
stout
personally
more
body
and
more
chocolate
character
would
be
appreciated
but
overall
very
satisfying
black
pour
with
a
bit
of
a
dark
red
tinge
to
it
and
a
small
to
medium
tan
head
sugar
and
toffee
in
the
smell
very
thick
and
inviting
heavy
malt
in
the
flavor
with
some
caramel
and
toffee
taste
and
some
chocolate
and
coffee
lingering
in
there
as
well
a
very
nice
chewy
mouthfeel
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
a
slight
bitter
finish
similar
to
but
far
more
mild
than
a
dry
stout
extremely
tasty
hope
to
visit
their
pub
the
next
time
i
am
in
seattle
d
this
big
ones
a
nice
sipper
purchased
liquid
solutions
d
pretty
good
and
enjoyable
o
very
yummy
beer
i
wants
more
welcome
to
texas
pikes
drinks
fairly
easy
the
complexity
dryness
would
make
me
want
to
move
on
after
2
or
3
good
take
on
the
style
brings
back
memories
of
drinking
this
at
the
beach
during
those
frigid
well
some
times
the
trade
winds
would
kick
up
winter
evenings
on
oahu
very
flavorful
for
what
it
is
and
a
solid
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
very
nice
stout
this
is
one
powerful
stout
weighing
in
at
6
6
per
the
label
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
quite
as
strong
its
an
excellent
brew
that
really
evolves
as
it
warms
and
keeps
every
sip
interesting
the
22
was
barely
enough
im
hooked
definitely
worth
a
try
should
you
get
the
opportunity
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
the
balance
the
roast
is
a
bit
acidic
for
my
taste
so
that
detracts
from
this
beers
overall
drinkability
but
other
than
that
it
is
a
really
presentable
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
foreign
extra
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
probably
not
after
a
koelsch
like
i
did
tonight
drinkability
pretty
good
taste
like
guiness
to
me
im
ok
with
this
one
but
they
make
a
better
bier
d
this
bottle
clocks
in
at
6
6
abv
rather
than
the
6
0
listed
in
the
description
but
it
remains
eminently
drinkable
two
brown
bombers
would
go
down
wo
much
effort
too
bad
i
wont
another
bottle
this
side
of
the

even
further

this
is
a

the

out
of
me
never
really
cared
for
the

brews
but
this
is
an
exception
highly
recommended

excellent
flavor
appearance
although
the
aroma
is
slightly
diminished
from
the
bottle
mouthfeel
not
as
bitter
and
strong
drinkability
is
the
same
the
taste
was
filled
with
bitter
coffee
and
semi
sweet
chocolate
the
roasted
malts
lingered
on
the
tongue
for
some
time
and
left
some
enjoyable
bitterness
as
well
overall
a
pretty
good
domestic
stout
thanks
to
dhgranstrand
for
this
bottle
in
a
recent
trade
pours
like
midnight
with
a
decent
sized
tan
head
nose
is
like
molasses
and
tar
but
really
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
it
there
flavor
is
thick
with
molasses
tones
noticeable
roasted
aspect
to
it
is
there
nice
thick
flavor
profile
that
stays
consistent
just
a
slightly
biting
carbonation
to
it
liquid
is
slick
pretty
nice
to
drink
on
this
one
a
very
robust
and
well
made
stout
a
nice
sipper
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
poured
this
at
about
60
degrees
surprisingly
not
very
aromatic
even
at
that
temp
very
strong
flavors
though
nicely
balanced
with
nice
hoppy
finish
i
will
definitely
buy
more
of
this
an
excellent
stout
highly
recommended
if
you
can
get
it
great
drinkability
for
a
hopped
up
stout
thanks
to
dnichols
pours
black
with
active
character
above
average
mouthfeel
hoppy
without
overbearing
and
still
balanced
roast
and
chocolate
that
are
lively
and
citrussy
king
of
hoppy
stouts
refreshing
d
this
is
pretty
drinkable
for
a
stout
nice
low
abv
smooth
if
a
bit
bland
d
the
medium
body
low
abv
and
smoothness
make
this
an
easy
brew
to
finish
the
moderate
biting
aftertaste
is
not
a
deterant
making
this
a
fine
session
stout
pours
black
with
the
slightest
red
light
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
nose
is
of
roasted
malt
a
little
bit
of
smoke
very
little
and
a
meatiness
taste
is
mostly
roasted
malts
with
some
slight
coffee
grounds
and
a
bittersweet
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
ok
good
roasted
flavors
make
this
one
tough
but
overall
i
think
i
could
drink
a
couple
maybe
three
a
good
session
extra
stout
good
flavor
served
at
cellar
temp
ive
had
it
again
a
couple
times
since
this
time
in
bottled
format
this
beer
really
serves
as
a
template
for
the
style
this
was
my
first
experience
with
pike
many
love
this
brew
and
probably
one
of
their
better
brews
poured
a
pitchblack

stout
with
a
medium
brown
foamy
head
with
low
retention
but
good
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
is
pretty
dominant
with
some
light
coffee
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
quite
dry
with
limited
chocolate
and
coffee
note
and
a
medium
bitter
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
malts
are
overpowered
by
hops
imho
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
pint
or
two
but
im
sure
i
wont
have
any
trouble
finishing
the
six
i
bought
this
is
probably
the
best
experience
ive
had
so
far
with
the
redone
pikes
but
it
still
wont
jump
to
the
head
of
the
line
when
i
next
visit
a
beerstore
not
until
they
dial
down
the
bitter
soy
sauce
flavor
a
bit
full
full
body
that
slides
down
easily
with
every
sip

well

best
beer
in

no
but
its
a
tasty
nicely
drinkable
stout
d
moderately
drinkable
like
the

the
smokiness
is
a
little
much
to
make
it
a
session
beer
im
actually
blown
away
by
this
brew
before
i
ordered
the
bottle
i
saw
it
had
good
reviews
but
i
didnt
expect
this
a
really
wonderful
unique
stout
the
mouth
is
not
as
creamy
as
i
like
but
this
has
a
nice
dry
finish
this
was
a
great
way
to
cap
off
my
visit
to
pike
minor
complaint
i
think
they
serve
this
beauty
to
cold
i
waited
several
minutes
to
let
it
warm
a
bit
notes
if
this
was
available
to
me
on
a
regular
basis
it
would
be
a
staple
in
my
arsenal
chewy

goodness
it
has
the
bigness
of
a

with

at

then
wow
i
did
not

that
a
puckeringly
bitter
grapefruit
pith

punch
at
the
finish
this
lasts
well
into
the
aftertaste
i
suppose
i
should
have
known
i
might
be
in
for
a
bit
of
hops
with
a
stated
65
ibus
on
the
label
i
must
admit
this
detracts
a
bit
from
the
experience
for
me
as
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
a
dense
roasty
and
chocolatey
stout
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
vinous
quality
this
stout
is
welldone
no
doubt
but
its
just
not
what
i
expected
given
its
nose
medium
body
and
silky
smooth
almost
fluffy
mouthfeel
if
i
had
another
bottle
of
this
beer
i
would
certainly
cherish
it
and
hold
on
to
it
until
i
had
the
particular
craving
for
a
big
roasty
stout
that
drowns
the
palate
in
pacnw
chop
flavors
at
the
finish
a
really
great
beer
in
the
end
but
caveat
emptor
and
all
had
this
on
tap
over
at
pikes
pub
in
seattle
where
it
was
served
cold
too
cold
for
my
taste
with
a
minimal
tan
head
that
dissapeared
quickly
it
was
hard
to
detect
any
aromas
coming
off
this
beer
as
initially
served
but
as
it
warmed
up
you
could
smell
the
roasted
malt
and
a
sweetness
that
reminded
me
of
either
caramel
or
toffee
the
color
is
a
very
dark
brown
that
almost
looks
black
in
the
pub
lighting
the
medium
body
and
moderately
low
carbonation
give
this
beer
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
nicely
balanced
between
roasty
malts
and
assertive
hop
bitterness
with
a
pleasantly
bitter
finish
this
is
a
very
drinkable
export
stout
d
complex
smelling
beer
however
i
could
not
stand
the
taste
i
could
barely
choke
it
down
much
too
bitter
the
taste
reminded
me
of
an
asprin
or
some
type
of
medicine
disolving
in
your
mouth
it
was
that
bitter
i
was
pretty
surprised
with
the
reviews
on
this
one
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
pint
of
this
one
or
a
dirty
glass
or
something
would
like
to
try
this
one
again

ive
really
been
looking
for
interesting
but
still
way
too
dry
for
my
taste
buds
d
very
drinkable
although
the
roasted
malts
do
leave
a
very
dry
finish
on
the
palate
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
to
date
d
pretty
tasty
stout
from
pike
definately
worth
the
chance
if
you
can
find
it
on
draft
luckily
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
offering
i
reviewed
this
before
but
ownership
has
changed
and
the
supposedly
the
recipe
along
with
it
it
is
now
listed
as

im
greatly
enjoying
this
stout
i
watch
as
the
liquid
tumbles
out
of
the
bottle
into
my
pint
glass
and
think
ive
seen
that
body
before
yes
i
have
ive
seen
it
in
some
of
the
best
imperial
stouts
there
are
which
would
be
stone
silver
city
and
fish
tale
this
being
a
foreign
stout
still
measures
up
to
the
aforementioned
the
head
is
only
a
quarter
inch
thick
but
a
lovely
sandy
color
theres
also
a
bit
of
lacing
going
on
nose
beats
you
in
the
face
with
hammerfists
of
chocolate
cocoa
and
fudge
it
screams
tap
out
wimp
whilst
in
its
corner
espresso
and
some
roast
bitterness
cackle
with
glee
man
this
is
way
better
than
last
year
and
i
am
absolutely
loving
it
mouth
is
servicable
enough
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
damn
this
is
a
special
stout
if
you
like
stouts
this
should
have
a
parking
space
in
your
fridge
if
it
doesnt
then
youre

in
there
the
mouthfeel
was
a

chunky
particles
clearly
not
filtered
taste
better
than
the
smell
but
overall
a
good
beer
in
a
touristy
pub
this
is
a
real
treat
on
tap
in
a
chalice
on
a
cold
evening
big
black
and
coffee
nosed
the
beer
stretches
its
burnt
malt
legs
after
a
few
sips
and
takes
you
home
to
bed
i
love
a
big
stout
that
is
not
too
high
in
alcohol
as
you
get
all
the
mouthfeel
without
the
headache
not
had
this
in
the
bottle
but
im
sure
it
cant
beat
this

really
good

you
can
tell
its
gonna
feel
creamy
from
the

surprisingly
hops
are
not
a
big
factor
in
this
one
gentle
cocoa
roastiness
are
paired
with
an
effective
and
complex
nut
array
to
create
a

as
it
sounds
i
feel
this
would
pair
well
with
asiatic
food
medium

moderate
carbonation
smooth
texture
this
beer
pours
a
black
body
with
a
thick

head
that
lasts
throughout
the
glass
this
beer
smells
of
citrusy
hops
with
a
hint
of
roasted
grain
taste
is
of
roasted
grain
reminiscent
of
bbq
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
paired
off
against

piney

nice
thick

the
beer
is
not
that
drinkable
as
a

beer
it
seems
higher
than

than
it
actually
is
slàinte
very
dark
beer
with
light
brown
head
which
didnt
stick
around
long
for
a
stout
the
sniff
test
managed
to
remind
me
of
coffee
cream
cherry
and
liquorice
tastes
of
an
abundance
of
roasted
malt
there
is
a
really
malty
tang
and
smokiness
but
no
real
coffee
flavour
phew
there
is
a
hint
of
dairy
and
some
welcome
but
ill
defined
hoppiness
in
the
background
the
feel
isnt
great
this
doesnt
slide
down
as
smoothly
as
one
expects
a
good
stout
to
especially
since
it
only
boasts

despite
all
those

i
wish
i
was
back
in

a
good

5x
stout
is
another
excellent
stout
from
a
largely
unheralded
u
s
craft
brewery
its
too
bad
that
the
vast
majority
of
these
fine
beers
are
unavailable
to
those
of
us
in
flyover
country
this
one
would
be
in
my
regular
winter
rotation
if
it
was
readily
available
in
iowa
recommended
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
it
gives
very
little
head
the
beer
is
a
nice
dark
brown
walnut
color
the
aroma
has
lots
of
red
wine
cherry
and
almond
i
can
only
describe
the
flavor
as
a
sour
stout
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
toast
there
is
a
bit
of
sweetness
at
the
beginning
but
the
sourness
takes
over
20022003
bottling
it
is
dark
black
with
a
sweet
aroma
that
smells
of
coffee
and
raisins
it
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
and
slight
chocolate
in
the
full
thick
body
it
is
smooth
and
sweet
in
the
finish
with
a

a

worth
finding
and
trying
this

pours
black
well
its
a
stout
what
do
you
expect
its
black
its
dark
and
there
are
some
ruby
edges
to
it
when
the
light
is
there
the
head
is
thick
and

some

notes
but
nothing
standing
out

body
is
on
the
thin
side
flavor
is
bitter
and
reminding
me
of
that
nasty
java
stout
from
bells
has
some
roasted

flavors
and
more
like
spent

grinds
in
my
opinion
the

me
tell

should
be

limited
as

pike
update

i
had
a
2005
vintage
in
may
and
found
it
to
be
very
consistent
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
here
in
seattle
and
this
wonderfully
brewery
is
just
a
few
blocks
from
where
i
work
this
poured
dark
black
with
a
small
caramel
colored
head
the
aroma
was
of
coffee
malt
and
smokiness
the
taste
was
quite
bitter
and
much
like
old
coffee
that
has
been
on
the
burner
a
little
too
long
the
mouthfeel
was
okay
there
was
a
little
too
much
bite
for
a
stout
and
a
strong
bitter
and
burnt
taste
i
am
not
likely
to
try
this
again
in
the
near
future
i
think
id
go
for
the
guiness
nitro
bottles
first
ive
really
enjoyed
most
other
stouts
more
than
this
one
from
pike
brewing
pours
with
viscosity
noticeable
appearance
is
black
thats
what
i
like
for
my
xxxstouts
a
medium
sized
creamy
compact
brown
head
is
erected
upon
the
pour
lacing
comes
in
sheets
the
aroma
is
burnt
malts
and
smoke
predominantly
almost
seems
to
be
a
barrel
aged
quality
on
the
nose
decent
nose
the
taste
is
of
roasted
malt
and
beechwood
smoke
not
sure
if
they
use
smoked
malt
or
not
but
its
sure
got
a
smoky
characteristic
the
bitterness
of
this
beer
lingers
hop
attributed
as
well
as
burnt
malt
this
ones
got
a
little
of
that
char
and
tobacco
thing
going
on
for
an
xxxstout
though
i
was
looking
for
this
one
to
be
a
little
more
intrusive
it
tastes
just
fine
but
i
was
looking
for
more
body
is
a
little
better
than
medium
and
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
creamy
good
beer
overall
not
much
more
though

i
like
what
they
are
going
for
with
a
blend
of
dry

imperial
stout
in
the
body
coffee
flavor
really
comes
through
in
the
flavor
along
with
some
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
finish
is
dry
and
has
a
lightly
hopped
character
this
might
not
be

all
the

it

assertive

of
sharply
burnt
unmalted
barley
and
smoked

espresso
hits
the
nose
at
first
then
diminishes
slightly
allowing
rich
yet
rounded
chocolate
malt
to
lend
a
distinct
mocha
impression
as
the
beer
breathes
buttery
malt
and
slightly
salty
tamari
notes
lend
an
odd
yet
enjoyably
savory
sensation
akin
to
a
more

surges
in
after

concomitantly
with

sweetness
providing
deep

presence
that
would
be
dessert
like
if
not
for
the
pronounced

complementary

satiatingly

xxxxx
is
an
absolutely
delicious
stout
that
only
improves
as
it
breathes
it
approaches
the
depth
of
overall
character
of
a
good
imperial
stout
but
packages
it
into
a
relatively
light
and
highly
drinkable
brew
reminscent
of
a
full
sail
imperial
porter
meets
rogue
willy
shakes
its
excellence
precludes
satisfaction
from
a
12
ounce
portion
a

be

appreciated
dark
as

the

a

crown
the

a
shield
against
the
light
sweet
toasted

bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
over
cooked
pot
of
coffee
what
the
hell
else
could
you
say
to
describe
this
nose
start
is
ambrosial
the
top
thick
and
chocolate
like
finish
has
a
spiteful
hop
spicy
bite
the
acidity
stinging
the
aftertaste
bitter
chocolate
dry
and
one
damn
fine
stout
in
my
humble
opinion
the
smell
is
reminicent
of
coffee
with
a
slight
suggestion
of
malt
the
flavors
of
coffee
roasted
barley
and
some
more
coffee
the
mouthfeel
is
significant
but
clean
the
mouth
is
left
dry
though
and
wanting
if
coffee
was
this
good
beautiful
dark
appearance
the
body
is
a
completely
opaque
black
and
the
head
is
a
creamy
orangebrown
it
drops
quickly
to
just
a
collar
and
thin
surface
covering
but
it
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
as
well
the
aroma
expresses
a
sharp
fruitiness
but
its
not
exactly
the
burnt
currant
aroma
thats
so
common
to
the
style
i
expected
it
might
lead
into
a
tart
flavor
but
theres
nothing
like
that
here
with
further
investigation
and
a
few
swirls
of
the
glass
some
smokiness
and
even
light
caramel
become
apparent
its
not
a
really
complex
or
rich
aroma
but
its
quite
intriguing
the
body
is
full
with
a
mild
and
exceptionally
fine
carbonation
thats
silky
smooth
across
the
palate
quite
velvety
the
flavor
delivers
the
fruitiness
promised
by
the
nose
but
its
awash
in
rich
bittersweet
chocolate
and
espressolike
roastiness
a
bold
bitterness
balances
and
dries
things
out
in
the
long
finish
where
a
distinctly
smoky
and
acrid
roastiness
lingers
an
exceptional
stout
that
stands
out
for
its
unique
character
well
worth
seeking
out
nice
pour
deep
opaque
black
with
an
easy
thick
creamy
head
that
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
its
not
exactly
longlasting
but
it
never
fully
fades
ends
up
thin
cream
layer
thats
too
thick
for
a
film
but
kind
of
like
a
like
coat
of
moss
or
lichens
the
aroma
is
a
little
weak
but
roasty
the
flavor
is
as
strong
as
it
should
be
but
it
dominated
and
unbalanced
by
too
much
burned
bitterness
a
bit
of
smokiness
lingers
underneath
the
lack
of
balance
makes
this
less
than
a
joy
to
drink
but
intriguing
at
the
same
time

jreitman
opaque
black

with
a

some

dominate
the
flavor
chocolate
is
hidden
well
but
can
be
discerned

imagined
sweetness
is
kept
to
a
minimum
very
enjoyable
and
interesting
brew
the
head
could
have
been
better
specially
with
the
thicker
body
but
the
flavor
was
right
on
the
mark
smooth
and
well
round
mouthfeel
within
its
medium
to
bold
body
and
very
lively
carbonation
this
brew
is
so
drinkable
considering
its
abv
yes
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
i
really
liked
this
beer
its
wellmade
and
very
tasty
and
drinkable
id
drink
it
again
without
thinking
twice
makes
me
wonder
what
it
is
about
beers
like
this
one
that
make
them
better
than
so
many
of
todays
overdone
imperial
stouts
i
had
this
beer
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
a
few
weeks
and
was
excited
to
try
it
i
was
extremely
disappointed
this
ranks
down
in
the
top
5
worse
beers
i
can
remember
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tulip
pint
dark
almost
black
fluffy
tan
head
smell
is
sweet
roastiness
maybe
some
coffee
notes
taste
is
quite
sweet
but
the
slightly
charred
flavor
at
the
back
keeps
it
from
being
cloying
thick
and
smooth
a
pleasant
beer
my
first
sri
lankan
beer
that
i
know
of
good
allaround
nice
and
roasty
and
stout
nothing
that
blows
me
away
though
pour
looks
great
everything
else
is
avg
at
best
smell
and
taste
like
its
a
stout
with
farm
house
taste
the
outstanding
flavor
profile
is
intense
complex
and
well
balanced
it
begins
with
a
blend
of
flavors
that
separate
into
chocolate
a
hint
of
coffee
and
very
subtle
prune
in
the
middle
the
big
malt
sweetness
comes
forward
with
a
molasses
and
caramel
flavor
against
a
mild
bitterness
of
citric
hops
and
roast
the
finish
is
a
slow
sweet
fade
and
leaves
you
with
that
nice
slight
alcohol
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
amid
an
effervescent
burst
owns
a
pitch
black
pour
and
rich
caramel
head
carries
a
green
olive
aroma
and
accompanied
with
the
same
in
taste
smooth
body
overall
worth
the
try
this
one
comes
highly
recommended
by
a
few
folks
and
the
guy
at
the
bottleshop
offered
to
buy
it
back
if
i
didnt
like
it
they
were
all
correct
this
one
should
be
on
the
musthave
list
for
anyone
whos
a
fan
of
stouts
interesting

less
creamy
and
a

than

a

go
this
ones
pretty
tasty
had
a
bottle
in
the
us
and
i
did
not
enjoy
this
this
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
there
is
no
way
to
know
how
long
the
bottle
has
been
on
the
shelf
and
how
it
was
treated
getting
there
eitherway
probably
not
the
best
beer
to
chose
to
export
to
the
us
overall
a
well
rounded
stout
overall
now
having
had
this
in
the
us
and
sri
lanka
there
is
a
definite
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
beer
depending
on
the
location
ive
had
this
in
can
and
bottles
in
the
us
but
othing
beats
having
it
on
draft
in
colombo
overall
an
decent
and
unusual
stout
a
bit
expensive
at
au90
a
case
the
flavours
come
across
a
bit
harsh
with
an
alcohol
fug
but
the
flavours
are
reasonably
well
rounded
i
will
have
one
every
now
and
then
ok
bit
watery
food
match
i
imagine
a
big
sri
lankan
curry
would
sort
this
stout
out
sharpish
served
on
tap
in
a
half
pint
glass
got
a
lot
of
prune
flavor
and
smell
that
i
havent
gotten
from
any
other
beer
before
0
a
very
unexpected
and
pleasant
surprise
the
aromatics
and
flavor
of
this
beer
left
me
quite
shocked
as
it
does
a
great
job
in
both
attributes
mouthfeel
aside
this
is
a
good
beer
not
hunt
it
down
or
a
new
standby
but
one
that
i
could
be
happy
with
drinking
on
most
occasions
amazingly
complex
for
a
stout
truly
needs
to
be
savored
unique
aftertaste
that
is
crisp
for
a
stout
i
noted
this
one
specifically
for
the
big
complex
aromas
on
the
nose
i
was
getting
chocolate
honey
vanilla
banana
pear
apple
coffee
espresso
and
roast
it
poured
a
very
dark
opaque
brown
with
a
light
brown
head
it
had
a
nice
silky
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
to
full
body
and
a
light
level
of
carbonation
to
the
taste
there
was
big
time
chocolate
and
coffee
also
vanilla
caramel
toffee
and
some
subtle
dark
fruits
aroma
was
definitely
the
star
on
this
one
but
its
hard
to
complain
about
anything
really
its
a
fantastic
beer
very
complex
and
easy
drinking
for
a
stout
this
big
great
malty
taste
right
up
front
slight
alcohol
burn
that
tastes
slightly
metallic
overall
a
well
rounded
stout
i
was
shocked
at
how
good
this
was
after
hesitantly
trying
it
for
the
first
time
it
is
a
solid
stout
with
big
flavor
that
will
stand
up
to
most
anything
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
taste
but
it
has
a
nice
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
finish
overall
rather
disappointing
was
hoping
for
a
big
stout
with
great
flavor
and
feel
and
ended
up
with
something
limper
and
less
tasty
that
expected
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
but
i
really
dont
think
so
ill
pass
next
time
didnt
impress
me
with
the
advertised
chocolatey

poured

still
managed

of
the

is

slightly
apparent
in
the
aroma
as
is
a
roasty
espresso
smell
the
taste
is
very
portlike
with
a
slight
chocolatecovered
dark
fruitiness
maybe
raspberry
or
raisins
a
nice
dry
roasty
coffee
bitterness
peeks
through
then
yields
to
some
residual
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
drinkability
is
very
smooth
particularly
for
such
a
large
alcohol
not
one
of
the
greatest
beers
in
the
world
in
my
opinion
but
certainly
not
overrated
quite
delicious
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
a
nice
foamy
tan
head
stuck
around
for
quite
a
while
and
left
nice
clumps
of
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
of
dark
malts
and
dark
chocolate
the
taste
wsa
pretty
good
with
hints
of
licorice
caramel
and
fresh
roasted
coffee
the
mothfeel
was
nice
and
creamy
and
rather
smooth
too
i
could
drink
these
all
night
too
bad
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
of
this
pours
black
with
a
nice
creamy
brown
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
in
my
glass
roasty
fruity
malty
aromas
taste
like
plums
chocolate
and
smoke
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
finishes
a
bit
sweet
alcohol
comes
through
as
it
warms
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
but
still
a
good
stout
12
ouncer
sampled
no
freshness
dating
pours
black
little
light
shining
through
the
edges
dark
tan
head
any
lacing
sliding
down
the
side
of
the
glass
nose
is
funky
and
of
burnt
malt
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
just
a
hint
of
burnt
malt
some
chocolate
and
drying
hops
alcohol
is
on
the
hot
side
and
a
bit
up
front
decent
product
but
other
stouts
come
to
mind
to
try
next
time
michael
jackson
has
quotes
on
the
bottle
label
that
describes
many
aspects
of
this
beer
pretty
well
flavor
was
consistent
throughout
the
drink
i
e
temperature
didnt
enhance
the
quality
of
the
taste
pours
a
very
dark
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
and
roasted
malts
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
chocolate
little
roasted
and
a
hint
of
raisin
moderate
body
and
slightly
creamy
drinks
really
easily
for
the
alcohol
level
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
beer
the
nose
is
really
full
of
chocolate
with
hints
of
raisin
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
really
chocolatey
slightly
raisiny
flavor
on
the
start
that
mellows
totally
to
a
chocolate
finish
nice
the
feel
is
moderate
to
thick
just
where
i
expect
things
for
this
beer
drinkability
is
fine
and
dandy
for
a
8
beer
i
would
not
expect
a
beer
like
this
to
come
from
a
country
like
sri
lanka
tastes
of
sweet
dry
chocolate
with
a
cardboard
edge
smoky
peaty
flavors
chime
in
and
then
fade
as
roasty
coffee
bitterness
takes
over
and
lasts
into
the
finish
big
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
not
badespecially
for
the
price
and
place
of
origin
appearance
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
full
foamy
tan
head
low
retention
aroma
is
dull
and
muted
roasty
and
chocolaty
with
a
light
hop
presence
metallic
notes
flavor
sweet
start
with
a
dominant
roasted
taste
chocolaty
and
a
lightly
dry
and
metallic
finish
palate
medium
bodied
and
creamy
with
low
co2
this
beer
seems
to
have
under
utilized
the
assets
of
the
ingredients
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
well
balanced
and
not
memorable
the
head
on
this
thing
is
like
a
root
beer
float
nice
and
sticky
with
heavy
lacing
down
the
entire
glass
it
came
on
really
strong
but
seemed
to
disperse
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
nice
with
a
heavy
chocolate
and
small
traces
of
anise
the
smell
is
much
sweeter
that
the
taste
the
roasted
coffeeness
really
comes
out
strong
the
high
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
the
background
but
it
clinges
to
the
throat
a
little
definately
a
nice
stout
with
some
heartyness
to
it
and
clearly
one
of
the
best
example
of
great
lacing
this
is
a
fine
beverage
to
sip
on
a
cold
fall
night
though
i
liked
this
beer
it
wasnt
the
endall
beall
of
my
stout
beer
experience
smells
and
tastes
of
roasted
coffee
malts
with
a
bit
of
chocolatey
goodness
on
top
a
tiny
bit
of
leftinthecoffeepottoolong
burn
smell
and
taste
going
on
though
barely
detectable
alcohol
subterfuge
going
on
here
youll
notice
the
punch
more
in
your
forebrain
later
than
on
your
tongue
slightly
chewy
and
very
smooth
a
good
drinkable
beer
puts
sri
lanka
on
the
map
for
sure
got
me
on
the
mothership
but
didnt
take
me
to
funkytown
nicely
drinkable
an
excellent
example
of
a
foreign
stout
i
highly
recommend
this
one
be
like
mike
pours
an
opaque
deep
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
scorchy
dark
malt
aromas
with
complements
of
chocolate
and
black
licorice
some
subtle
hops
and
a
slight
yeastiness
to
the
nose
roasty
graininess
is
upfront
strangely
enough
it
goes
somewhat
watery
midpalate
and
finishes
with
a
slight
fruitiness
and
more
dryness
from
roasted
grain
and
light
hopping
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
rich
letting
the
drinker
know
this
beer
is
not
a
domesticated
brew

not

not
a

to
support
the
other

there
are
better

including
ones
that
dont
get
michael

to
pimp
their

damn
tasty
whatever
you
call
it
i
call
it
a
baltic
porter
i
really
enjoyed
this
forget
the
hype
and
bias
and
just
drink
it
up
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
tight
body
and
the
brains
to
back
it
up
paired
nicely
with
the
9grain
bread
i
just
made
a
wonderful
stout
and
cheaper
that
sinebrychoff
or
d
carnegie
co
highly
recommended
and
an
exceptional
brew
for
the
price
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
its
not
great
but
at
7

it
might
become
a
regular
around
the
house
wyll
what
a
surprise
for
3
00
usd
for
a
22
oz
bottle
this
beer
is
a
steal
especially
considering
its
smooth
complexity
very
easy
to
drinkability
and
balanced

say
the

softens
again
late
with

yielding
to
the

a

stout
lacks
the
beefy
character
of
us
microbrewed
stouts
of
the

agreeably
so
in
that
regard
dry

thanks
to

this

the
beer
after
divorcing
the

never

with
a
delicate
fruitiness
just
underneath
the

peeks
in
just
a
bit
but
doesnt
mar
the
enjoyment
of
whats
nearly
a
perfect
stout
beats
the
hell
out
of

but
gets
me
yearning
for
an
expedition
hearty
and
proud
as
its
namesake
lion
is
a
stout
fit
for
a
king
lightly
spicy
in
the

nutty
and
neverending
tastiness
this
was
part
of
a

was
by

the
best
of
the
bunch
almost
black
thin
light

reminds
me
of
a

theres
also
some
nice

notes
and
blackened

and
coffee
really
nice
nose
flavors
got
some
nice
bitter
roasted
notes
to
it
a
little
chocolatey
dry
vanilla
bean
sweet
lactic
sugars
add
a
bit
of
a
baltic
porter
feel
to
this
stout
i
like
it
the
body
is
mediumfull
lightly
carbonated
and
easy
down
the
chute
good
stuff
black
body
does
allow
a
little
bit
of
light
through
the
extreme
edge
the
dark
tan
head
is
like
a
froth
of
chocolate
milk
toast
chocolate
caramel
and
plums
are
in
the
aroma
the
same
follows
into
the
flavor
with
the
addition
of
a
little
char
in
the
back
very
tasty
stout
that
really
doesnt
taste
as
strong
as
it
actually
is
dark
fudge
brown
nearly
black
thin
and
firm
light

taste
is
mild
with
tame
roastability
and
soft
chocolate
slight
floating
sweetness
of
dry
dark
fruits
touches
of
molasses
and
toffee
roast
doesnt
withstand
too
much
in
the
flavor
dept
or
in
its
length
over
far
to
quickly
but
it
does
incur
a
certain
broad
range
of
capable
character
feel
is
smooth
a
bit
sweet
and
tangy
lightly
roasted
edge
just
shy
of
a
medium
body
mostly
seems
to
pick
up
a
bit
towards
the
finish
where
it
drys
out
with
some
light
cocoa
a
fairly
decent
effort
quick
stout
flavors
and
a
somewhat
healthy
body
but
could
be
better
i
would
consider
this
over
a
guinness
on
nitrotap
i
think
a
very
enjoyable
stout
and
one
id
been
looking
forward
to
trying
and
im
glad
i
did
nice
and
rich
and
though
i
dont
think
i
could
pound
these
all
day
a
couple
of
these
are
worthwhile
a
12ounce
bottle
served
in
a
latrappe
goblet
that
poured
thick
and
completely
opaque
leaving
a
somewhat
thin
but
beatiful
dense
layer
of
foam
that
stayed
put
for
several
minutes
i
think
to
myself
that
this
is
going
to
a
dense
stout
i
am
right
the
aroma
is
of
heavy
with
cocoa
and
espresso
the
first
sip
is
sweet
and
smooth
with
cocoa
andor
dark
chocolate
up
front
followed
by
more
cocoa
notes
laced
with
bitter
espresso
theres
more
bitterness
mixed
with
dark
rum
flavors
towards
the
finish
which
is
long
and
warming
nice
lacework
is
left
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
as
i
continue
to
sip
this
beer
the
carbonaton
is
a
bit
high
and
detracts
a
bit
from
the
quality
of
this
beer
but
overall
an
excellent
potent
stout
that
is
sweet
without
being
too
sweet
lion
stout
from
sri
lanka
in
a
22
ounce

a
deep

but
a
great
garnet
color

up
when
held
up
to
a
strong
light
great
thick
coffee
and
cream
head
very
rocky
and
extremely
long
lasting
aroma
is
sweet
like
a
mocha
espresso
great
taste
fairly
complex
leaning
definitely
toward
the
sweet
side
of
things
to
say
the
least
some
flavors
from
the
coffe
family
as
well
and
some
roasted
malts
flavors
are
notable
as
well
i
think
im
beginning
to
understand
warm
weather
stouts
thick
sweet
and
cool
and
nowhere
near
as
heavy
as
cake
or
the
like
nice
and
well
worth
picking
it
up

a
dark
black
with
huge

thats
real
chunky

real
well
it
looks
amazing
smells
of
coffee
chocolates
and
alcohol
nose
is
pretty
big
tastes
of
big
roasted
malts
that
leads
to
a
nice
alochol
warming
but
finish
stops
pretty
quick
with
no
real
lingering
alcohol
you
get
in
most
big
stouts
tastes
noted
include
bitter
chocolates
coffee
and
fruits
nice
dry
finish
that
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
stout
moderate
carbonation
with
nice
warming
quality
to
it
great
beer
cant
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
this
is
a
nice
last
beer
before
bed
kinda
thing
great
brew
will
have
again
and
again

says
this
beer
is
tarry
not
to
me
and
it
could
use
some
for
balance
very
drinkable
and
agreeable
uncomplicated
perhaps
a
touch
too
sweet
overall
long
love
beer
this
stout
is
so
dark
brown
it
is
almost
inky
black
and
light
will
not
pass
thru
it
and
it
has
a
brown
to
light
brown
head
the
smell
of
sweet
roated
malts
beckons
to
you
from
the
glass
i
expected
more
roasted
flavor
but
the
taste
is
a
well
rounded
smooth
sweetness
and
roasted
malt
together
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
outstandin
appearance
almost
black
rich
creamy
head
and
outstanding
lacing
real
eye
candy
nice
rich
aroma
with
roasted
notes
and
light
malt
presence
i
picked
up
a
light
coffee
flavor
that
was
nicely
mild
considering
the
brews
strength
initially
sweet
it
branched
into
a
start
tartness
at
midpalate
and
ended
with
a
light
bitterness
and
dry
finish
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
but
smooth
easy
on
the
drinkability
side
especially
at
8
abv
definite
recommendation
a
big
full
body
is
the
package
for
the
abundance
of
flavors
and
aromas
that
take
this
beer
to
another
level
perfect
carbonation
makes
its
easy
to
drink
and
allows
you
to
wade
through
the
ocean
of
flavors
presented
a
highquality
brew
that
stands
out
from
most
competition
drink
at
cellar
temperature
for
best
results
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
has
a
high
abv
yet
hides
it
extremely
well
and
has
a
lot
of
character
good
stuff
drinkability
is
fairly
high
very
nice
beer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
looks
like
it
should
in
the
glass
dark
with
a
nice
head
it
has
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
its
aroma
goes
down
smooth
who
knew
that
a
damn
fine
beer
could
come
out
of
sri
lanka
i
think
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
reddish
tint
near
the
bottem
of
the
glass
with
a
slight
brown
headaroma
is
of
burnt
fruit
and
bitter
chocolate
very
intense
flavors
in
this
one
burnt
fruit
and
bitter
sweet
chocolate
with
some
nice
earthiness
in
the
finish
i
really
like
this
stout
very
intense
flavors
a
nice
one
to
savor
in
my
opinion
12
ounce
bottle
lion
stout
is
a
worthy
concoction
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
english
in
character
deserving
of
its
praise
pretty
nice
quite
rich
chocolatey
fruity
nose
taste
of
caramelised
sugar
which
i
didnt
particlarly
like
then
some
dark
fruit
chocolate
caramel
and
bitter
roastyness
pretty
famous
in
beer
circles
and
hard
to
belive
its
from
sri
lanka
im
happy
i
finally
had
it
i
loved
the
look
of
this
pitch
black
with
a
beige
colored
head
that
came
large
and
stayed
at
medium
size
for
awhile
smelled
of
strong
semisweet
chocolate
chips
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
intense
chocolate
like
a
mochachino
only
problem
is
that
the
flavor
is
withdrawn
and
doesnt
fully
show
itself
theres
also
a
sourness
in
the
beer
that
seems
like
it
shouldnt
be
there
is
that
supposed
to
be
the
hops
is
it
some
astringency
from
the
grains
i
dont
know
but
i
do
know
that
it
mixes
with
the
chocolate
and
creates
an
off
flavor
body
is
medium
to
weak
in
thickness
could
be
much
better
than
it
is
this
stout
poured
an
opaque
black
color
with
light
brown
foam
the
smell
was
malty
but
not
overly
strong
the
taste
was
rather
sweet
and
malty
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
with
low
carbonation
feel
the
body
was
medium
the
drinkability
was
ok
this
stout
came
in
a
625ml
bottle
reasonably
priced
at
2
69
poured
a
jet
black
with
a
large
tannish
head
that
had
good
retention
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
malt
smelling
like
dark
fruits
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
same
was
evident
in
the
forefront
of
the
taste
with
the
finish
featuring
a
slight
hop
bitterness
with
chocolate
malt
flavors
also
coming
through
the
mouthfeel
was
light
a
little
bit
watery
definetely
not
as
thick
as
some
of
the
stouts
i
have
most
enjoyed
i
cant
say
that
i
was
let
down
but
after
seeing
micheal
jacksons
endorsement
on
the
back
i
did
expect
a
little
more
overall
not
bad
but
not
the
best
pours
midnight
black
with
a
rich
caramel
colored
head
aromas
of
semisweet
chocolate
and
mocca
the
smell
carries
through
to
the
taste
promissing
a
semisweet
chocolate
but
finishing
with
a
bitter
coffee
flavor
there
is
a
mild
hoppiness
throughout
the
head
lasted
quite
a
while
the
beer
finishes
smooth
a
very
nice
stout
huge
light
brown
head
that
lasts
aroma
is
a
palate
of
impressions
sweet
roastyness
is
the
dominant
impression
but
coffee
comes
to
mind
as
well
flavour
is
very
coffeeish
and
roasty
pleasant
bitterness
imediately
on
the
tongue
and
palate
alcohol
is
nicely
hidden
both
nose
and
flavor
are
full
with
chocolate
and
over
ripe
plums
a
slight
hoppiness
seems
to
flow
through
near
the
finish
excellent
brew
not
a
bad
effort
black
body
with
mahogany
highlights
topped
by
a
dark
tan
head
sweet
roasted
malt
aroma
some
nice
dark
fruits
and
a
touch
of
hops
spiciness
as
well
the
sweet
roasted
malt
continues
into
the
taste
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
note
as
well
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
as
well
the
aftertaste
is
like
a
bite
of
a
sweet
plum
followed
by
a
cup
of
coffee
maybe
its
a
jelly
donut
followed
with
a
coffee
chaser
in
any
event
its
good
the
mouthfeel
is
robust
and
smooth
having
a
bit
of
a
creaminess
to
it
the
drikability
is
good
as
well
even
as
the
slight
tobacco
juice
note
starts
appearing
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
a
beer
that
i
should
have
tried
sooner
stout
but
the
flavor
misses
the
mark
for
me
although
i
do
prefer
dry
rather
than
sweet
stouts
in
general
not
bad
liquorish
with
a
dark
chocolate
hue
a
deep
heavy
malt
is
at
once
creamy
and
sweet
lacking
any
real
hop
aroma
the
surprise
is
the
full
bitter
hop
bite
heavy
and
flavorful
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
blend
in
well
tricky
alcochol
is
certainly
there
but
hardly
noticeable
the
creamy
head
fades
quickly
id
often
seen
this
beer
and
ignored
it
because
of
its
corny
label
have
to
say
im
happily
surprised
i
really
like
this
stout
i
would
consider
this
to
be
my
favorite
sweet
stout
i
do
not
like
overly
sweet
beer
pours
a
little
thinner
and
more
carbonated
than
a
lot
of
stouts
with
a
nice
foamy
head
some
retention
very
dark
almost
black
smells
sweet
and
roasty
i
plan
to
try
this
in
a
taste
test
with
samuel
smith
my
favorite
stout
which
has
the
best
balance
of
malt
and
hops
of
any
stout
ive
had
not
much
hop
bitterness
evident
here
real
smooth
for
its
strength
8
abv
will
sneak
up
on
you
fast
as
i
said
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
have
always
enjoyed
it
nothing
leaps
out
at
you
but
it
is
as
easy
to
drink
as
any
stout
ive
had
and
will
put
a
glow
on
you
in
a
hurry
next
drinkability
give
me
another
drink
drink
drink
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
are
just
classic
i
love
it
possibly
my
favorite
all
around
stout
that
i
have
tasted
it
really
is
amazing
hell
even
michael
jackson
endorses
this
one
but
then
again
his
opinion
is
just
that
another
opinion
the
lion
stout
pours
a
very
dark
opaque
tone
of
deep
blackish
brown
with
hints
of
ruby
at
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
that
complements
the
body
is
an
incredible
milk
chocolate
hue
of
brown
head
and
leaves
a
sturdy
even
lace
down
my
imperial
pint
the
aroma
is
saturated
with
dark
malts
especially
the
chocolate
roasts
very
well
done
and
the
flavor
of
this
brew
contains
the
perfect
combination
of
sweet
creamy
chocolate
full
of
coffee
roasts
and
a
smooth
dryness
that
mellows
the
finish
so
nicely
with
the
medium
light
body
and
the
creamy
mouthfeel
to
each
sip
this
beer
is
so
drinkable
that
besides
the
abv
there
is
no
reason
why
it
shouldnt
deserve
a
five
quite
the
impressive
work
of
art
straight
from
who
would
have
thought
sri
lanka
mj
make
some
room
cause
this
ba
would
like
to
sign
his
seal
of
approval
on
the
lion
stout
poured
a
soapy
like
head
that
thickened
up
to
a
solid
chocolate
colored
foam
left
rings
of
sticky
brown
lace
even
before
the
first
sip
consistency
poured
of
oil
that
gulped
aroma
was
of
smokecoffeeand
chocolate
very
creamybut
not
very
crisp
on
the
mouthfeel
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
impressiveand
wasnt
almost
watery
alcohol
taste
is
present
and
noticed
leaves
a
dry
bitter
after
taste
that
stays
in
the
back
of
the
throat
a
very
good
stout
but
not
the
best
overall
average
a
very
quick
developing
head
colored
like
a
frappacino
sits
easily
on
top
of
a
very
very
dark
dark
maroonblack
colored
almost
wine
smelling
bier
the
first
sip
delivers
chocolate
and
mellow
hops
its
almost
syrupy
constitution
lends
itself
well
to
the
smell
they
work
very
well
together
if
the
taste
could
develop
more
of
an
after
taste
or
carry
the
flavor
further
along
the
tongue
it
would
be
an
outstanding
beer
the
alcohol
volume
is
not
readily
tasted
but
comes
across
in
the
wine
like
smell
first
off
let
me
say
that
this
stout
delivered
much
more
than
i
was
expecting
its
very
unique
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
it
pours
an
opaque
black
body
with
no
visible
highlights
topped
by
a
full
very
creamy
light
tan
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
really
nice
full
lace
the
aroma
is
fruity
cocoaish
and
mildly
chocolatey
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
and
gentle
carbonation
that
leaves
it
quite
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
taste
starts
fruity
becomes
sweetly
chocolatey
and
finishes
with
a
light
almost
smoky
roastiness
and
lingering
softly
sweet
notes
of
chocolate
and
caramel
very
mocha
the
dark
malts
lend
a
light
acidity
which
accentuates
the
fruitiness
and
helps
to
balance
the
malt
it
never
becomes
cloying
the
well
balanced
bitterness
is
subtle
and
it
relies
on
the
roastiness
and
light
acidity
to
help
balance
the
sweet
malts
although
its
probably
not
the
best
beer
for
a
night
out
with
the
lads
it
makes
a
great
appertif
dessert
beer
or
nightcap
well
worth
trying
pours
a
super
dark
brownblack
with
only
the
slightest
of
light
getting
around
the
edges
and
a
nice
brown
head
the
nose
has
a
lot
of
sweet
malt
and
chocolate
aromas
along
with
some
slightly
alcoholic
notes
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
huge
sweet
chocolatey
notes
and
some
slightly
biscuity
malt
as
the
brew
progresses
there
is
a
slightly
earthysmoky
taste
that
emeges
as
the
brew
finishes
there
is
a
nice
creamy
quality
to
this
beer
that
makes
it
nice
and
smooth
and
rather
drinkable
im
not
sure
if
this
one
deserves
the
attention
that
it
gets
from
michael
jackson
but
it
is
a
nice
stout
that
makes
a
great
desert
brew
with
its
sweetness
milkchocolate
colored
head
that
sticks
to
the
glass
deep
spicy
exotic
aromas
of
incense
chocolate
allspice
and
raspberry
reduction
sweet
alcohol
flavor
drives
notes
of
coffee
cane
and
grape
good
mild
balancing
bitterness
on
the
mediumlong
finish
a
decent
stout
to
drink
much
better
if
you
just
smell
it
though
my
only
complaint
would
be
the
somewhat
fizzy
carbonationbut
that
again
is
noticed
because
of
comparison
to
other
stouts
i
will
definitely
be
having
more
of
this
with
cooler
weather
coming
i
may
have
to
stock
some
thing
black
with
a
stable
beige
head
smell
has
notes
of
roasted
malts
and
sweetness
smooth
soft
mouthfeel
very
creamy
for
the
most
part
a
very
good
beer
i
swear
however
that
my
bottle
had
a
small
metalictasting
flaw
still
the
beer
has
great
balance
very
tasty
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
sri
lanka
not
as
complex
as
i
thought
it
would
be
but
that
is
finish
being
that
a
brew
with
such
strength
can
be
so
drinkable
ill
going
back
to
this
beer
for
sure
sweet
fruity
nose
with
hints
of
burnt
malts
many
flavors
present
that
all
mesh
quite
well
chocolatecocoa
raisinsplums
its
light
bodied
for
its
complexity
and
strength
and
drinks
quite
well
i
think
my
package
store
did
me
a
favor
by
aging
it
for
meit
was
4
months
past
its
exp
date
creamy
aroma
yet
with
some
smokey
hints
big
bubbly
tan
head
slightly
sweet
beginning
fruity
yeast
flavor
smooth
drinking
i
was
underwhelmed
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
more
its
got
strong
hints
of
chocolate
and
smells
slightly
burnt
its
thinner
than
it
looks
but
still
have
a
good
feel
an
ok
beer
but
i
wouldnt
make
it
a
habit
2
99
for
a
big
bottleconditioned
625ml
bottle
was
not
much
to
pay
at
all
this
stuff
is
great
overall
a
superb
stout
imho
as
a
fan
of
full
bodied
stouts
this
beer
didnt
impress
me
as
much
as
its
reputation
in
the
beer
publications
indicated
it
would
i
felt
it
was
on
the
dry
irish
stout
side
but
without
the
creamy
head
and
roasted
malt
flavors
bitter
roasted
barley
but
not
much
malt
backbone
left
me
wanting
more
and
not
getting
it
beer
from
sri
lanka
eh
im
game
this
is
a
solid
sweetish
stout
with
a
rocky
fragrant
head
and
a
nice
oiliness
to
it
from
the
hops
maybe
different
enough
from
other
brews
to
make
it
interesting
although
slicker
than
perhaps
the
very
best
stouts
milky
juicy
with
what
i
imagined
as
a
rummy
sugarcane
undercoat
i
thought
it
very
drinkable
perhaps
not
worth
a
trip
to
ceylon
but
definitely
worth
picking
up
out
if
you
find
it
in
your
local
store
as
i
did
bottle
had
a
drinkby
date
of
september
this
year
bought
it
in
february
notes
overpromoted
by
michael
jackson
and
overhyped
in
general
a
pretty
average
sweet
stout
that
has
potential
to
be
something
better
but
it
never
gets
there
it
sits
somewhere
between
a
dry
irish
stout
and
typical
sweet
stout
leaning
a
bit
too
much
towards
the
dry
with
its
flat
one
dimensional
malt
profile
still
at
least
worth
a
try
for
all
of
you
stout
lovers
out
there
for
me
this
stout
fits
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
two
extremes
namely
dry
and
milksweet
stouts
it
has
both
a
dryness
and
a
sweetness
it
has
a
creamy
texture
that
is
not
cloying
lion
stout
would
be
by
far
the
best
stout
to
ever
cross
my
lips
provided
guiness
had
never
existed
cheers
really
heavy
on
the
coffee
and
toasted
notes
a
really
good
export
stout
just
ok
for
me
not
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
a
case
of
good
coffee
notes
followed
by
a
roasty
aftertaste
o
a
great
fes
with
some
nice
layers
and
depth
of
flavor
the
8
5
goes
unnoticed
which
makes
it
all
too
easy
to
drink
a
solid
seasonal
indeed
4
035
its
as
good
as
the
song
and
thats
high
praise
i
did
not
get
a
chance
to
sample
this
the
first
time
it
was
brewed
im
glad
that
i
got
a
crack
at
it
thye
second
time
around
the
style
is
right
on
just
not
really
my
style
a
fantastic
stoutale
almost
as
flavorful
as
the
nitro
from
the
same
brewery
surprised
by
this
one
expected
a
below
average
beer
but
this
drinks
solid
nothing
crazy
but
it
drinks
pretty
well
nice
work
here
final
thoughts
in
a
marketplace
flooded
with
breweries
pumping
out
ipas
its
sometimes
easy
to
overlook
one
that
does
such
a
fine
job
on
darker
beers
first
milk
stout
then
wake
up
dead
now
fade
to
black
will
be
another
reason
to
commend
left
hand
for
putting
out
great
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
othis
is
a
very
solid
foreign
export
stout
i
think
this
one
nails
many
of
the
true
characteristics
of
that
style
while
amping
up
the
abv
just
enough
to
put
a
newworld
craft
beer
spin
on
it
it
may
not
be
as
complex
as
many
ba
offerings
but
it
drinks
well
and
the
drying
finish
is
nice
change
from
many
stouts
out
there
o
great
aroma
flavorful
and
drinkable
smooth
with
a
nice
finish
overall
got
this
as
part
of
a
random
case
although
ive
been
pretty
impressed
with
left
hands
milk
stout
before
now
this
one
really
scores
in
the
taste
stakes
and
has
a
bit
more
depth
than
their
milk
stout
definitely
a
winner
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
for
sure
o
just
a
terrific
pick
from
hop
city
birmingham
not
sure
why
i
grabbed
it
but
left
hand
never
fails
at
great
taste
would
drink
again
this
black
beauty
is
exactly
why
i
keep
falling
in
love
with
the
fade
to
black
series
one
release
at
a
time
silky
on
the
palate
with
notes
of
cardamom
and
licorice
this
brew
warms
up
with
espresso
and
molasses
on
the
finish
cloudlike
head
and
a
welldeveloped
perfume
contribute
to
make
this
a
sensory
experience
not
to
be
skipped
fade
to
black
is
like
the
best
dark
beer
series
ever
i
am
glad
they
reproduced
vol
1
as
i
missed
it
the
first
go
around
this
one
is
a
very
nice
stout
has
all
the
characteristics
that
one
would
like
definite
must
try
this
beer
pours
an
extremely
dark
brown
color
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
flattens
out
and
floats
on
the
top
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
poured
the
beer
at
about
40
degrees
the
taste
at
that
temp
was
dominated
by
chocolate
as
it
warmed
the
taste
became
more
bitter
i
preferred
this
beer
c
pours
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
a
thinner
beige
foamy

a
little
sediment
was
seen
in
the
bottem
of
the
bottle
after
the
pour
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
black
espresso
for
the
most
part
more
going
on
with
the
taste
with
the
black
coffee
right
up
front
followed
by
the
roasted
malts
that
leave
a
bitter
dry
finish
with
a
good
amount
of
smoke
didnt
last
too
long
but
it
was
there
and
a
bit
much
for
me
really
didnt
taste
the
alcohol
but
you
could
tell
it
was
in
there
a
heavybodied
brew
with
perfect
carbonation
it
came
out
of
the
beer
cooler
at
36
degrees
and
on
the
side
of
the
label
it
says
enjoy
at
5055
degrees
f
i
will
say
that
it
did
taste
better
when
it
warmed
up
some
been
looking
for
the
perfect
smoked
beer
since
i
went
to
a
beer
festival
and
had
one
which
i
could
never
find
in
the
beer
stores
this
one
is
the
ultimate
it
tastest
like
charred
meat
not
a
real
pleasant
taste
o
a
nice
stout
lots
of
strong
roasted
flavors
definetly
worth
checking
out
look
deep
brown
nearly

it

good
beer
tastes
a

like

stout
i
was
anticipating
a
lot
from
this
stout
ssome
roasted
malts
with
some
coffee
notes
very
average
tstarted
off
with
roasted
charred
malts
followed
by
coffee
and
a
huge
bitterness
that
just
lingered
oi
was
expecting
a
lot
more
from
this
stout
the
coffee
is
nice
and
mild
which
is
a
welcome
difference
for
me
it
starts
off
great
and
just
abruptly
ends
it
builds
up
without
an
exciting
finish
the
stout
was
kinda
watery
and
thin
feeling
the
bitterness
did
subside
as
the
stout
warmed
overall
it
was
enjoyable
but
not
memorable
and
i
would
not
seek
this
out
again
o
a
solid
stout
overall
big
roastycharred
flavors
not
as
rummysweet
as
i
tend
to
expect
from
the
style
but
thats
fine
an
enjoyable
drink
all
around
drinks
far
too
easily
for
its
size
pours
a
thick
black
with
3
fingers
of
brown
fluff
that
eventually
all
but
disappears
nutty

sweet
with
lots
of
nuts
and
dryly
toasty
malt
flavors
thick
with
a
medium
body
and
a
creamy
slick
feel
pretty
drinkable
neither
the
best
nor
the
worst
reminds
me
a
lot
of
their
milk
stout
mainly
the
underlying
clean
sweetness
of
it
might
have
again
worth
a
shot
black
coffee
color
with
a
light
laced
nutty
brown
head
on
pour
smells
of
roasted
coffee
tastes
roasted
with
hints
of
chocolate
with
the
taste
going
seamlessly
from
sweet
to
bitter
in
a
single
gulp
light
and
refreshing
feel
in
mouth
overall
a
very
nice
stout
particularly
for
anyone
who
likes
their
coffee
black
as
it
has
strong
taste
and
aroma
notes
of
black
coffee
the
feel
is
different
than
expected
from
a
stout
but
not
in
a
way
that
detracts
much
rather
its
just
something
special
to
remember

and
very
smooth
to

for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
its
not
a
stout
i
would
drink
all
the
time
after
the
one
i
wouldnt
want
a
second
even
though
the
first
one
was
very
good
i
think
its
the
finish
at
the
end
of
each
swallow
you
dont
get
that
satisfying
lingering
good
taste
in
your
mouth
if
i
saw
this
beer
in
the
store
i
would
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
to
drink
occasionally
its
an
excellent
stout
just
not
a
go
to
stout
overall
4
15
this
is
a
fine
textbook
stout
it
has
a
good
chocolate
and
roasty
base
with
a
nice
smoky
undertone
something
in
the
finish
is
lacking
for
me
perhaps
not
enough
lingering
robust
aftertaste
that
i
prefer
this
does
improve
as
it
warms
however
the
nose
drew
me
in
though
if
you
see
this
on
the
shelf
its
worth
a
shot
bought
as
a
single
would
easily
buy
a
6
or
two
and
save
to
cold
dead
of
winter
to
have
in
front
of
fire
great
stout
looks
like
they
brought
back
volume
1
this
year
which
is
great
because
i
never
had
a
chance
to
try
it
when
it
first
came
out
its
big
for
even
an
export
style
lots
of
booze
in
here
but
you
cant
taste
it
less
black
in
color
than
some
of
the
others
in
the
series
but
real
dark
and
slick
looking
holding
an
off
white
inch
or
more
of
light
airy
fluff
the
nose
and
taste
are
the
same
heavy
dry
roast
black
espresso
and
chalky
textured
cocoa
i
like
the
deep
dark
complexity
and
like
how
the
beer
is
only
a
little
fuller
than
medium
body
it
allows
the
drinker
to
experience
the
flavor
without
the
density
uncommon
for
sure
longer
lasting
in
the
finish
than
i
usually
like
but
its
not
due
to
sugar
that
malt
char
character
from
the
aroma
is
back
on
my
tongue
in
the
finish
mildly
bitter
and
very
earthy
great
beer
maybe
y
favorite
in
the
series
nice
to
see
it
come
back
around
aroma
is
nutty
with
huge
caramel
overtones
becoming
milk
chocolatey
mid
scent
and
finishing
lightly
roasty
smells
pretty
sweet
notes
of
tar
are
subtle
as
is
the
dark
fruit
character
but
they
open
as
it
warms
flavor
is
roasty
throughout
with
a
bitter
finish
that
is
slightly
charred
sweet
chocolate
upfront
becomes
nutty
in
the
aftertaste
underlying
dark
fruit
notes
of
tart
cherry
add
intrigue
its
a
bit
more
charred
and
bitter
than
id
prefer
everything
a
stout
should
be
if
they
made
this
in
nitro
it
would
be
a
55
o
surprisingly
solid
for
its
value
saw
it
on
the
shelf
and
bad
it
and
it
sounded
worth
trying
glad
i
did
lots
of
flavor
in
this
one
enjoy
it
cool
not
cold
very
very
very
very
0
very
drinkable
stout
i
would
have
this
one
again
for
sure
no
1
would
be
much
better
without
the
rauch
addition
im
not
a
fan
of
smoked
brews
weird
cant
recommend
even
at
212oz
drain
pour
it
should
be
noted
that
this
beer
is
8
50
abv
but
you
would
not
guess
it
is
any
higher
than
5
from
the
flavor
of
the
beer
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
dry
stout
with
a
nice
dark
and
roasted
flavor
the
mainly
dark
and
bitter
body
was
balanced
by
just
the
right
level
of
sweetness
making
for
a
nice
roasty
brew
addendum
and
edit
i
aged
one
of
these
and
it
was
quite
a
bit
mellower
and
better
integrated
after
a
year
improving
the
alcohol
hit
overall
wow
i
think
this
may
be
better
than
vol
2
which
i
have
had
previously
really
drinkable
and
a
shame
that
it
has
been
a
oneanddone
brew
to
date
just
one
more
finger
pointing
at
the
mastery
left
hand
has
shown
over
their
ability
to
produce
quality
drinkable
smoked
beers
keep
em
coming
left
hand
this
is
the
kind
of
stuff
that
has
made
you
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
in
the
country
what
more
can
i
say
other
than
go
find
yourself
one
of
these
retirees
if
you
can
this
beer
while
aged
appropriately
has
given
true
value
to
my
cellaring
project
i
am
extremely
pleased
and
would
not
hesitate
to
recommend
this
fine
beer
to
a
friend
for
the
price
its
a
nobrainer
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
really
nice
deep
black
color
the
head
was
fluffy
and
fan
colored
the
smell
was
roasted
and
a
little
musty
the
taste
was
rich
with
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
it
was
a
little
sweet
at
first
and
then
fell
into
a
dry
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
leave
a
nice
creaminess
in
your
mouth
overall
i
was
glad
i
picked
this
one
it
was
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
o
underwhelming
all
around
bear
in
mind
im
comparing
this
to
good
stouts
id
say
that
its
on
par
with
a
guinness
pretty
good
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
pretty
good
example
of
an
export
stout
and
i
shall
rate
it
accordingly
wish
i
had
a
bottle
of
vol
2
the
body
is
what
impressed
the
most
thick
full
and
creamy
very
drinkable
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
i
traded
for
this
a
long
time
ago
and
then
lost
it
at
the
back
of
my
beer
fridge
a
solid
beer
for
sure
but
nothing
extraordinary
i
wouldnt
mind
getting
more
of
this
but
i
wouldnt
go
crazy
seeking
it
out
o
pretty
good
i
liked
this
one
the
flavors
are
well
rounded
and
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
it
really
wasnt
anything
mind
blowing
just
a
solid
export
stout
it
fits
the
style
to
a
t
the
foreign
export
stout
has
lots
of
roast
as
indicated
by
the
nose
w
mild
smoke
in
the
flavor
w
gentle
grain
astringency
and
subtle
yeast
fruitiness
there
is
some
coffeelike
earthy
qualities
with
a
finish
that
is
semidry
i
really
enjoyed
this
a
quality
strong
dark
brew
overall
it
fits
the
style
well
and
has
nice
malt
layers
w
a
very
drinkable
quality
as
it
opens
up
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
repeatedly
the
mouthfeel
feels
a
little
thin
for
the
style
while
carbonation
is
on
the
lower
side
drinkability
is
good
i
really
liked
the
roasty
burnt
dark
chocolate
bitterness
it
brought
in
the
finish
pretty
nice
beer
overall
wow
left
hand
path
continues
to
make
great
new
beers
this
beer
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
hint
of
burgundy
it
pours
smoothly
into
a
snifter
with
minimal
head
a
light
sugary
aroma
and
almost
zero
carbonation
this
beer
is
thick
but
smooth
a
very
good
brew
hv
going
to
put
a
few
of
these
in
the
cellar
to
age
and
rereview
d
smooth
easy
to
drink
a
sessionable
stout
if
there
ever
was
one
d
not
always
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
a
pretty
good
example
of
it
definitely
higher
in
alcohol
than
i
was
initially
anticipating
but
it
does
not
really
show
itself
k
a
very
enjoyable
way
to
end
a
drinking
session
ill
try
this
one
again
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
turns
out
its
pretty
strong
coulda
fooled
me
until
i
stood
up
this
was
probably
my
biggest
surprise
of
2009
im
very
glad
i
saved
a
bottle
now
on
to
volume
2
but
i
really
hope
i
havent
seen
the
last
of
volume
1
amazing
beer
highly
recommended
not
a
fan
of
left
hand
at
all
but
this
is
downright
decent
i
would
drink
this
again
poured
into
a
tulip
the
color
is
definitely
pretty
close
to
black
with
a
nice
head
the
nose
brings
quite
a
good
amount
of
dry
roasty
malt
characteristic
of
the
style
there
is
some
light
chocolate
and
coffee
behind
that
roasted
malt
comes
back
after
those
diminish
the
taste
follows
the
pattern
of
the
nose
with
a
really
strong
roast
presence
takes
of
the
feel
is
well
thats
for
sure
drinks
pretty
well
as
everything
comes
together
in
the
end
a
good
beer
but
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
after
all
the
hype
left
hand
is
no
stranger
to
highabv
stouts
their
imperial
stout
is
amazing
stuff
that
deserves
more
love
than
it
gets
volume
1
of
the
fade
to
black
series
is
delicious
beer
that
can
hold
its
head
high
when
lined
up
alongside
the
heavy
hitters
of
the
style
first
sip
is
remarkably
smooth
very
creamy
mouthfeel
and
the
roasted
malts
are
nicely
integrated
into
the
beer
there
is
a
nice
coffee
like
flavor
that
is
not
harsh
in
the
slightest
hops
are
minimal
alcohol
is
very
nicely
disguised
im
quite
impressed
with
this
one
it
is
not
very
sweet
which
really
makes
this
beer
very
drinkable
overall
an
amazing
beer
from
left
hand
though
i
drink
left
hand
from
time
to
time
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
their
line
but
this
beer
is
great
i
sincerely
hope
they
make
this
beer
a
year
round
beer
versus
a
one
off
this
is
quite
drinkable
given
the
abv
the
bitterness
adds
to
the
drinkability
as
i
am
not
turned
away
like
with
some
sweeter
stouts
this
is
a
worthy
beer
d
this
was
a
really
nice
stout
great
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavors
with
hidden
alcohol
perfect
for
dessert
looking
forward
to
this
years
release
verdict
the
inaugural
fade
to
black
is
solid
and
easily
drinkable
big
stout
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
new
winter
seasonals
this
year
and
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
these
guys
brew
up
next
winter
drinkability
a
solid
beer
and
one
im
glad
to
have
tried
the
8
5
was
completely
buried
it
was
neither
seen
heard
nor
spoken
to
i
can
imagine
from
someone
who
likes
milk
as
my
drinking
partner
does
the
astringencies
of
the
toastiness
and
the
slight
sourness
here
surely
not
an
infected
batch
combining
with
the
milky
notes
to
suggest
spoiled
milk
but
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
not
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
to
be
sure
but
one
that
suggests
good
things
to
come
drinkability
goes
down
easily
for
an
8
5
on
a
midafternoon
summer
day
id
have
this
one
again
for
sure
i
just
wish
the
smell
were
less
like
sour
milk
d
this
is
a
solid
brew
by
left
hand
i
kinda
wish
i
had
picked
more
up
when
i
found
it
i
will
certainly
recommend
this
one
to
my
friends
would
get
this
again
follows
the
aroma
closely
roasty
up
front
then
the
malt
sweetness
comes
in
hints
of

pretty

i
love
stopping
here
after

poured
ontap
at
the

served
in
a

the
beer
is
a
dark
vibrant
ruby
highlighted
dark
brown
coloring
with
a
light
tan
frothy
head
the
head
retnetion
is
good
and
it
clings
to
everything
as
you
drink
subtle
roasted
coffee
and
smokey
nose
with
a
mocha
sweetness
in
the
background
the
flavors
are
rich
with
a
heavier
smoke
presence
supporting
the
roasted
coffee
backbone
there
are
touches
of
chocolate
throughout
the
palate
as
well
bitter
and
smokey
aftertaste
with
a
slightly
drying
rich
finish
very
tasty
the
taste
was
bold
an
unassuming
with
dark
malts
and
smoke
but
it
had
more
of
a
porterlike
character
low
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
one
of
the
better
stouts
i
have
tried
as
i
am
not
big
into
stouts
in
the
first
place
but
i
would
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
moat
beers
and
a
really
nice
stout
the
roastiness
was
perfect
after
a
hike
and
i
imagine
even
better
in
the
dead
of
winter
they
really
nail
an
excellent
balance
of
bitterness
and
roastiness
for
the
style
very
drinkable
pours
was
a
very
dark
brown
from
a
different
angle
black
there
was
light
foam
a
top
and
some

was

bitter
dark

dark
chocolate
espresso

light

in

overall
pretty

i
didnt
expect
to
find
one
a
nice
surprise
i
hope
to
actually
make
it
up
to
the
moat
mointain
brewery
itself
deep
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
small
head
they
pour
these
ice
cold
and
right
to
the
top
of
the
glass
which
is
hard
to
complain
about
but
i
would
have
rather
had
it
slightly
warmer
and
with
a
little
more
head
very
small
tan
head
not
much
lace
i
tried
to
let
this
one
warm
up
but
ultimately
poured
it
down
my
gullet
fast
very
smooth
and
creamy
ultimately
drinkable
chocolately
and
slightly
bitter
very
dry
which
i
enjoy
if
i
wasnt
on
a
n
conway
shopping
excursion
i
wouldve
guzzled
a
couple
more
great
stout
nothing
over
the

pours
dark

near

scent
is
a
moderately
strong
mix
of
roasted

mixed
with

freshly
ground
espresso
taste

solid
roast
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
lightly

with
light
notes
of
dark
fruit
thrown
in
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
smooth
but
with
a
bit
of
grainy
and
powdery
heft
a
good
drinkable
full
flavored
stout
in
a
time
where
many
places
strive
for
big
overall
this
is
a
very
good
version
of
an
american
stout
lots
of
flavor
and
viscosity
going
on
without
a
huge
amount
of
alcohol
definitely
recommended
to
those
who
like
this
style
drinkability
a
nice
sipper
that
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
ordering
i
like
how
the
beer
transitions
from
a
chocolate
portion
to
a
coffee
portion

closes

lingers

the
swallow
mouthfeel
is

and
drinkability
is
very
nice
as
well
good
brew
all
around
a
decent
drinkability
with
some
sticky
mouth
coating
feel
but
dries
a
bit
and
mostly
clean
for
a
dark
stout
overall
i
would
definitely
give
this
another
try
if
moat
mountain
was
more
readily
available
in
my
area
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
but
its
well
carbonated
and
its
pretty
drinkable
i
would
like
to
revisit
this
one
but
i
am
not
in
a
hurry
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
something
i
would
get
at
any
bar
if
it
were
available
this
is
a
delicious
stout
and
id
happily
drink
it
again
id
love
to
try
this
on
a
nitro
pour
i
always
think
of
foreign
export
stouts
as
defined
by
guinness
this
is
definitely
not
guinness
but
is
quite
tasty
in
its
interpretation
of
the
style
guest
tap
at
the
portsmouth
brewery
served
in
a
pint
glass
this
was
a
dark
brown
almost
black
beer
with
a
thick
sticky
tan
head
it
had
a
mild
roasted
malt
and
coffee
aroma
with
perhaps
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
the
taste
copied
the
aroma
but
there
was
a
nice
lingering
of
the
roasted
malt
pleasant
beer
would
drink
it
again
i
found
this
to
be
very
smooth
though
an
attenuating
smoke
hits
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
leaves
a
trace
of
chalky
character
lying
around
on
the
whole
though
it
stand
up
well
i
found
this
pour
to
be
more
subtle
in
some
ways
than
the
one
i
had
previously
its
not
bad
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
even
perhaps
a
stout
suitable
for
hot
days
you
do
need
to
be
ready
for
this
style
however
had
on
tap
at
the
barleypub
in
dover
i
also
enjoyed
this
with
a
slice
of
rich
chocolate
cake
courtesy
of
fellow
bas
purplehops
and
purplehats
so
that
made
it
even
better
i
normally
dont
go
for
stouts
but
was
intrigued
as
id
never
even
heard
of
this
brewery
well
they
do
a
good
stout
that
i
can
say
my
full
pint
pour
was
opaque
and
dark
with
some
slight
ruby
highlights
it
came
topped
with
a
small
filmy
latte
colored
head
aroma
was
more
subtle
than
expected
my
notes
tell
me
that
there
was
some
faint
cocoa
powder
medium
body
fresh
tasting
smooth
and
roasted
characteristics
were
the
predominant
flavors
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
more
from
this
brewery
mediumfull

creamy
this
stout
poured
a
deep
black
color
with
brown
foam
that
settled
quickly
and
left
a
shiny
mirrorlike
black
surface
the
smell
was
nice
and
strong
sweet
very
dark
malt
coffee
and
a
hint
of
banana
the
taste
was
slightly
sweet
dark
malt
and
roasted
barley
with
some
fruit
banana
coffee
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
low
background
hop
bitterness
throughout
the
flavor
lingered
on
the
tongue
nicely
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mediumfull
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
this
was
a
good
stout
but
would
have
been
better
with
a
bit
more
carbonation
or
perhaps
nitrogenation
from
a

with

over

it

on

mocha
head
lacy
and
airy
on
top
of
the
dark
brown
hersheys
colored
brew
some
bitterness
going
on
in
the
nose
and
taste
a
hint
of
grass
this
has
more
hops
than
others
and
that
helps
it
also
seems
to
have
as
much
of
a
brown
ale
malt
base
as
it
does
a
stout
one
roast
is
there
but
the
cocoa
malt
thing
is
too
chocolate
gives
way
to
coffee
in
the
finish
intense
coffee
but
there
is
no
java
in
this
brew
from
what
i
a
aware
of
the
feel
also
is
different
for
a
stout
tons
of
bubbles
and
english
yeast
character
i
think
in
some
ways
its
the
best
of
three
different
worlds
foreign
stout
black
ale
and
english
brown
all
contributing
equally
drinkable
as
anything
fairly
priced
and
quite
different
from
others
one
of
the
best
coopers
beers
going
has
a
strange
after
taste
to
me
quite
chocolaty
very
nice
brew
a
fav
deep
chocolate
brown
not
wanting
to
let
any
light
through
decent
head
dissipating
quickly
leaving
nice
light
tan
lacing
light
malty
nose
with
hints
of
sugared
coffee
taste
to
me
has
a
hint
of
licorice
up
front
followed
by
some
bitter
malt
and
roastedalmost
burnt
coffee
not
bad
a
little
unbalanced
but
overall
ok
overall
one
of
my
favourite
stouts
well
put
together
very
traditional
style
with
a
big
punchy
flavour
add
to
that
a
price
of
au58
a
case
of
24
x
375ml
and
this
is
also
one
of
the
best
value
stouts
around
along
with
cubs
sheaf
stout
not
fizzy
that
is
what
did
it
for
me
and
a
definite
coffee
lovers
brew
a
dark
beer
with
a
coffee
with
cream
colored
head
i
could
tastse
roasted
malts
and
coffee
with
some
dark
chocolate
deep
reddishbrown
color
a
nice
burntcaramel
flavor
and
surprisingly
refreshing
for
a
stout
not
too
heavy
this
one
was
great
i
really
like
this
beer
a
very
sweet
and
sour
stout
that
i
surely
will
drink
again
solid
drop
although
thats
to
be
expected
from
the
coopers
family
have
spent
many
a
day
drinking
their
pale
and
sparkling
ale
and
somehow
had
never
sampled
their
stout
from
a
750ml
longneck
into
a
pint
glass
best
after
20
april
2014
a
looks
a
solid
black
with
a
nice
dark
coffee
head
s
smells
a
nice
bitter
chocolate
with
a
little
vanilla
and
coffee
too
t
like
it
smells
chocolate
fudge
and
some
coffee
bitterness
overall
a
solid
stout
that
id
be
happy
to
drink
any
day
not
a
complex
example
of
the
style
but
a
great
goto
for
a
daily
drop
keep
a
couple
or
a
case
in
the
fridge
and
youve
got
guaranteed
satisfaction
if
youre
yearning
for
something
dark
certainly
give
it
a
go
o
export
stouts
arent
usually
my
thing
but
this
was
pretty
good
this
is
a
really
cracking
good
beer
my
first
beer
tried
from
australia
and
id
like
to
buy
a
ton
more
of
it
please
o
easily
the
best
massproduced
beer
in
australia
o
a
nice
beer
it
has
all
the
caracteristics
of
the
style
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
for
me
overall
a
very
classic
stout
the
feel
isnt
as
smooth
as
i
would
like
but
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
option
and
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
7
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
some
sweetness
molasses
like
taste
is
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
chocolate
somewhat
light
and
mild
some
smokiness
as
well
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
poured
from
a
bottle
into
an
english
pub
glass
nearly
pitch
black
with
the
odd
red
flash
glimmering
here
and
there
with
a
wholesome
milkshakelike
tan
head
aroma
includes
roasted
barley
rich
milk
chocolate
cold
coffee
and
a
whiff
of
smoke
palate
reflects
all
these
elements
as
well
along
with
a
tannic
red
wine
fruitiness
that
is
rather
interesting
in
a
stout
bittersweet
with
carob
and
butterscotch
diacetyl
raisins
or
dried
currants
and
blonde
roast
coffee
flitting
in
and
out
of
awareness
something
different
with
each
sip
smooth
and
creamy
body
semithick
certainly
more
so
than
an
irish
dry
stout
with
an
earthy
dry
teabag
finish
that
also
hits
a
few
wood
char
and
chocolate
milk
notes
on
the
way
out
plenty
tasty
and
id
make
this
a
goto
stout
if
it
was
easier
to
find
in
these
parts
i
like
the
juxtaposition
of
sweet
dark
malts
and
tannic
fruitybitter
almost
burtonesque
flavors
its
not
a
super
heavy
hitter
looking
considerably
darker
than
it
tastes
if
that
makes
sense
but
features
more
character
than
some
of
its
better
known
massproduced
counterparts
from
ireland
my
enjoyment
of
sweet
sleek
malty
export
stouts
cannot
be
measured
by
modern
science
but
take
the
score
posted
above
as
proof
that
i
really
like
em
coopers
best
extra
stout
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
and
as
a
relatively
light
and
approachable
beer
with
strong
and
substantial
personality
is
an
easy
thing
to
recommend
to
all
drinkers
solid
offering
just
lacking
that
final
push
a
beer
ive
wanted
to
try
for
ages
a
bit
thinner
than
other
stouts
but
this
increases
its
appeal
to
me
i
could
definitely
fit
a
few
of
these
in
one
go
nice
roasted
cocoa
taste
is
a
plus
as
well
give
it
a
go
o
4
im
really
surprised
in
a
good
way
by
this
beer
being
a
big
fan
of
imperial
stouts
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
examples
with
a
lower
abv
and
gravity
that
are
just
as
satisfying
this
one
is
it
will
stay
in
my
rotation
for
a
while
poured
from
a
375
ml
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
pitch
black
with
a
small
brown
head
smells
of
berries
and
fruit
with
slight
coffee
tastes
of
slight
coffee
with
sour
fruit
intersting
combination
that
is
pretty
good
beer
is
carbonated
heavily
andy
goes
down
really
easy
for
its
medium
body
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
slight
charlike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
char
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
but
the
flavors
come
off
as
a
bit
too
acrid
and
burnt
for
my
liking
excellent
foreign
stout
far
from
boring
and
still
very
drinkable
in
my
opinion
better
than
the
regular
guinness
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
very
enjoyable
drinker
good
example
of
what
a
stout
should
be
worth
checking
out
the
bodys
big
enough
to
keep
everything
together
but
with
a
bit
too
much
of
a
sharp
bite
to
it
smoothness
is
present
but
generally
somewhat
on
the
lower
side
there
is
a
good
heft
to
it
though
oh
and
if
you
cant
guess
im
watching
robocop
as
i
write
this
pleasant
without
being
overly
strong
or
in
your
face
despite
the
relatively
high
abv
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
almost
a
little
too
easy
and
would
make
a
good
if
a
little
strong
session
ale
coopers
best
extra
stout
has
a
nice
malty
aroma
and
a
lovely
hoppy
dry
finish
i
didnt
have
big
expectations
here
but
i
am
impressed
with
this
offering
i
would
like
to
try
this
not
only
on
tap
but
nitro
i
bet
that
would
mellow
out
the
bubbles
a
lot
anyway
i
am
impressed
sad
to
see
coopers
go
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
out
there
for
us
to
try
o
weird
beer
that
seems
to
attempt
to
be
a
guinness
it
fails
definition
problem
here
bottle
nose
has
moderate
well
balanced
roastiness
and
sweetness
and
it
pour
a
reasonable
but
short
lived
big
rocky
tan
head
glossy
black
to
the
eye
it
has
reasonable
depth
with
an
effervescent
start
on
the
palate
which
leads
to
a
fairly
hollow
middle
thin
not
watery
but
is
in
need
of
more
content
and
individuality
this
beer
makes
want
to
kiss
an
aussie
babe
that
is
anyway
poured
out
a
dark
pitch
black
color
and
is
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
that
simply
screams
i
cant
get
sunburned
in
somalia
the
head
gently
thins
out
into
a
layer
of
bubbles
and
a
layer
of
thick
creamy
lacing
it
smells
like
a
dry
scotch
with
only
a
hint
of
butter
mild
dark
fruits
and
some
raisins
bitter
at
first
it
spreads
out
to
coat
your
mouth
a
with
mediumtolight
mouth
feel
the
roasted
malts
are
very
alive
and
they
are
very
pronounced
in
this
beer
the
aftertaste
is
quit
tame
and
only
a
hint
of
citrus
zest
and
alcohol
is
present
for
a
bottle
carbonated
stoutit
feels
reasonably
thick
and
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
overall
blown
away
the
aussies
make
an
exceptional
stout
here
totally
dominated
by
a
milk
chocolate
tone
its
just
delicious
and
feels
perfect
i
could
almost
give
this
a
perfect
score
mate
there
are
aromas
of
roasted
barley
malt
sweet
milk
chocolate
and
faint
hints
of
coffee
and
alcohol
you
get
roasted
malts
and
that
milk
chocolate
flavor
right
up
front
there
is
that
coffee
type
bitterness
on
the
back
end
and
the
alcohol
is
not
very
detectable
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
is
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
an
excellent
stout
it
covers
all
what
you
expect
from
a
stout
overall
a
unique
stout
by
coopers
this
is
my
first
foreignexport
stout
and
im
quite
surprised
by
the
intensity
of
flavours
tastes
more
potent
than
the
abv
suggests
worth
seeking
out
od
considering
this
is
ranked
so
high
on
the
top
oz
beers
this
is
pretty
weak
in
no
way
is
this
even
comparable
to
a
number
of
the
craft
examples
here
this
is
in
no
way
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
hype
worthy
one
and
not
necessarily
a
good
one
i
wish
i
just
had
a
small
bottle
decent
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
i
had
no
interest
in
finishing
the
bottle
o
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
coopers
though
none
of
them
are
bad
beers
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
i
would
certainly
get
this
one
again
12
7
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
pour
with
a
small
tan
head
this
tastes
like
every
foreign
stout
ive
ever
had
sweet
lactose
creamy
aroma
with
a
decidedly
roasty
flavor
profile
plenty
of
dark
bread
crusts
a
whisper
of
fruitiness
and
a
dry
finish
a
perfectly
adequate
stout
but
not
something
i
would
care
to
have
again
if
only
because
of
its
genericness
overall
a
touch
old
but
this
is
forgiven
since
it
came
from
around
the
world
a
really
good
stout
overall
overall
a
surprisingly
decent
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
a
friend
found
these
in
the
back
of
his
fridge
and
knew
i
liked
beer
not
something
i
would
ever
really
buy
but
atleast
the
other
5
wont
be
too
hard
to
drink
overall
nice
representation
of
a
stout
very
flavorful
rjt
good
stuff
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
ever
had
it
just
has
so
much
flavor
and
just
so
perfect
for
winter
i
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
o
solid
export
stout
not
heavy
by
any
means
but
full
flavoured
and
well
balanced
really
nice
profile
overall
a
very
nice
export
stout
good
flavors
rich
and
full
keeping
a
few
of
these
on
hand
is
not
a
bad
idea
this
pours
a
mostly
black
color
but
its
not
as
thick
as
and
imperial
stout
and
doesnt
have
that
motor
oil
effect
the
body
was
also
very
yeast
sediment
filled
hazy
with
an
okay
mocha
head
which
quickly
dissipated
the
feel
was
medium
a
little
light
for
a
stout
the
smell
was
of
roasted
malts
and
coco
the
taste
was
a
little
of
the
same
it
wasnt
very
aggressive
there
was
the
coco
some
molasses
and
a
little
roasted
malts
but
not
enough
to
give
a
very
bitter
after
flavor
there
was
also
this
unusual
earthy
taste
overall
a
decent
stout
but
nothing
memorable
enough
to
go
out
and
buy
again
a
nice
brew
malty
aroma
sweet
for
an
export
stout
head
is
thin
to
non
existant
but
lightly
laces
glass
chocolaty
brown
color
roasted
grain
and
slight
hop
think
of
a
guinness
thats
gone
slightly
flat
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
toung
nicely
overall
a
decent
beer
overall
this
beer
is
awesome
nearly
flawless
to
me
but
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
the
style
bottom
line
roll
this
one
around
before
pouring
the
lees
really
improved
it
overall
this
is
an
above
average
stout
that
i
recommend
to
a
lot
of
people
since
it
is
one
of
the
few
good
ones
available
in
brazil
i
like
how
roasty
it
is
and
the
use
of
hops
to
mellow
the
tartness
o
i
really
liked
the
aroma
on
this
brew
complex
and
wellrounded
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
on
occasion
food
match
rich
and
hearty
stews
would
work
well
anything
that
you
would
call
rustic
or
peasant
food
would
go
down
well
with
this
drop
huzzah
overall
bolder
and
even
sweeter
than
many
milk
stouts
and
a
lot
sweeter
than
dry
stout
it
makes
a
great
dessert
beer
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
again
o
i
was
torn
between
a
4
5
and
a
4
but
i
thought
that
i
was
a
little
bias
and
so
gave
it
a
4
only
also
that
was
the
most
common
out
of
the
previous
4
scores
i
love
this
beer
and
to
think
about
it
critically
has
made
m
like
it
more
if
anything
great
nose
body
and
look
but
the
taste
is
fantastic
easily
one
of
the
4
best
stouts
in
australia
and
one
of
the
best
priced
beers
considering
the
quality
12
7
oz
brown
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
pours
an
opaque
black
body
with
a
thin
khakicolored
head
milk
chocolate
dominates
the
aroma
with
some
espresso
and
nut
notes
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
dominate
the
flavor
with
caramel
sweetness
playing
a
nice
supporting
role
and
some
biscuity
flavor
too
medium
bodied
with
moderate
to
low
carbonation
every
bit
as
good
as
i
remember
it
being
years
ago
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
again
not
so
sure
i
am
with
the
majority
here
in
terms
of
a
classic
aussie
ale
pours
very
nicely
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
breaks
up
very
quickly
attractive
chocolate
brown
in
colour
aromas
are
a
touch
underwhelming
mild
chocolate
and
dry
roasted
malts
good
length
fairly
fizzy
palate
for
the
style
and
probably
subdues
the
flavours
from
really
hitting
their
straps
again
what
should
be
obvious
stout
characters
of
chcoloate
and
roast
is
mild
not
really
deserved
of
its
top
5
oz
status
given
this
beer
was
drank
relatively
young
i
can
only
assume
in
needs
a
little
time
to
show
its
best
a
solid
brew
and
a
pleasant
evening
sipper
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
everything
seems
to
be
put
together
properly
a
stout
you
can
order
with
security
knowing
you
wont
be
disappointed
great
work
o
would
have
another
a
great
stout
d
a
top
quality
stout
from
coopers
and
well
worth
a
try
drinkability
all
in
all
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
easily
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
this
beer
will
be
in
my
fridge
again
in
the
future
overall
a
nicely
done
brew
yet
kept
in
check
by
a
limited
depth
of
character
overall
quite
pleasant
though
restrained
a
bit
interestingly
this
bottle
offers
a
best
after
date
but
i
couldnt
read
it
flavor
expands
some
with
warming
adding
some
hop
notes
on
the
nose
its
like
reclining
in
my
favorite
wellworn
comfy
couch
i
could
just
sit
here
all
night
rather
bold
stout
but
still
very
good
drinkable
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
an
export
stout
this
is
one
of
the
better
brews
in
its
style
though
the
relatively
average
look
and
feel
kept
it
back
in
the
ratings
a
bit
if
youre
a
fan
of
export
stouts
you
cant
go
wrong
here
recommended
drinkability
is
alright
cheap
and
good
quality
but
i
dont
think
id
have
any
more
than
750
mls
in
one
session
sampled
out
of
375ml
bottle
at
alexs
grandmas
house
did
the
strawberry
tablecloth
give
it
away
label
reads
best
after
10708
so
im
very
excited
to
see
how
it
has
aged
pours
very
dark
almost
pitch
black
color
and
didnt
bother
decanting
out
the
sediment
produces
a
thick
rocky
mochacolored
head
with
lacing
that
clings
in
clusters
down
the
glass
sediment
sits
on
top
like
powered
hot
chocolate
nose
of
roasted
coffee
some
smokey
hints
palate
is
nutty
mostly
hazelnut
with
the
smokey
aftertaste
much
more
pronounced
lots
of
bittersweet
chocolate
coffee
grounds
linger
along
with
the
slight
warmth
from
the
6
3
abv
maybe
even
higher
after
bottleconditioning
aging
very
rich
brew
medium
body
and
drinkable
with
slight
dryness
in
the
finish
delicious
it
does
have
a
slightly
boozy
feel
to
it
so
i
reckon
1
at
a
sitting
would
be
otimal
for
me
a
decent
strong
stout
the
booze
is
well
integrated
the
fruitiness
fairly
interesting
and
the
bottleconditioned
effervescence
adds
an
interesting
contrast
to
the
creamy
dessert
core
of
this
offering
worthy
of
seeking
out
as
an
alternative
to
that
worldly
irish
export
of
the
same
creed
a
big
gulp
reveals
strong
coffee
flavor
with
a
background
of
dark
roasted
malts
medium
hop
presence
with
a
little
kick
in
the
swallow
but
little
lingering
bitterness
well
rounded
taste
overall
a
stout
of
good
measure
drinkability
i
have
had
better
stouts
but
this
is
not
bad
at
all
this
would
be
nice
on
those
real
cold
winter
days
and
evenings
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
not
too
many
it
is
warming
which
is
a
plus
but
could
probably
only
handle
this
for
one
evening
the
flavors
are
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
like
drinkability
this
was
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
both
easy
to
drink
and
to
finish
id
certainly
be
willing
to
have
it
again
one
nice
thing
or
perhaps
dangerous
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
quite
easy
to
keep
drinking
it
and
to
regret
pouring
the
last
drop
a
good
solid
well
made
beer
and
one
worth
having
drink
so
far
i
have
been
really
impressed
with
the
beers
from
coopers
this
is
a
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
stock
and
will
seek
it
out
again
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
stouts
i
will
admit
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
then
i
though
i
would
perhaps
i
need
to
take
another
look
at
this
brewery
drinkability
is
good
i
wish
the
body
is
a
little
more
heavier
otherwise
its
pretty
good
stout
at
the
moment
im
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
here
this
would
be
a
real
winner
if
available
in
sixpacks
at
a
nice
sierra
nevada
price
point
the
face
it
is
i
cant
remember
how
much
this
single
cost
me
but
likely
more
than
2
anyhow
this
is
a
good
one
if
run
across
this
is
a
very
decent
stout
and
one
of
the
better
ones
that
is
readily
available
here
in
oz
if
it
lacks
the
depth
and
complexity
of
the
best
examples
it
can
perhaps
be
forgiven
its
a
pretty
decent
brew
all
up
good
drinkability
the
quintessential
australian
stout
this
beer
has
a
delicater
aroma
nice
frothy
head
great
dark
roasted
color
and
is
smoothe
leaves
a
bit
more
stronger
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
than
other
stouts
tend
to
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
is
still
good
lukewarm
d
this
is
a
flavorful
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
definitely
want
to
try
another
one
of
these
in
the
future
drinkability
is
pretty
good
completely
inoffensive
beer
final
notes
this
is
a
beer
id
have
with
a
hearty
meal
of
either
barbecue
or
spicy
food
also
nice
and
warming
to
have
out
by
the
campire
or
in
front
of
the
fireplace
on
a
cold
day
an
allaround
good
beer
upon
tasting
this
extra
stout
it
is
rather
light
with
a
lot
of
roasty
flavors
swirling
around
a
bit
of
nuttyness
comes
through
and
finishes
with
a
bit
of
dark
coffee
i
would
certainly
recommend
this
beer
to
anybody
that
enjoys
a
dark
beer
and
even
to
those
who
do
not
it
is
even
drinkable
during
these
warm
days
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
brown
particles
floating
throughout
no
head
and
no
lacing
scent
is
of
chocolate
dark
roasted
grain
nuts
earth
char
some
brown
sugar
and
a
noticable
scent
of
alcohol
taste
brings
a
quick
taste
of
earth
char
and
dark
roasted
grains
followed
by
a
muddled
punch
of
dark
fruit
and
alcohol
some
touches
of
carmel
and
brown
sugar
on
the
rear
medium
bodied
dry
and
somewhat
astringment
finish
a
decent
bolder
style
stout
with
some
unpleasent
flavors
that
cloud
it
a
touch
coopers
best
extra
stout
pours
a
deep
inky
black
with
a
thin
head
that
doesnt
last
long
the
aroma
is
rich
sweet
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
sweet
caramel
malt
and
chocolate
come
first
in
the
flavor
leading
to
some
mild
astringency
and
damp
earthy
hop
flavor
roasted
malt
comes
through
in
the
finish
leaving
a
nice
coffee
flavor
the
bitterness
is
mild
and
coupled
with
the
astringency
from
the
roasted
malt
balances
the
flavor
well
this
turned
out
to
be
a
very
nice
fes
with
a
whole
boatload
of
roasted
malt
flavour
nice
job
from
coopers
d
a
pleasant
generic
stout
good
with
hearty
foods
and
cold
nights
i
want
to
rate
this
higher
but
its
just
average
d
nice
i
could
drink
4
of
this
with
no
problem
i
love
stout
good
stout
and
we
have
one
here
black
in
color
with
a
little
ruby
coming
through
bottle
conditioned
so
lots
of
yeast
i
love
that
smells
like
beer
heaven
dark
malts
and
english
ale
yeastyish
ahh
the
taste
is
even
better
the
went
as
far
as
you
can
go
with
the
malt
without
going
to
far
perfect
hop
balance
good
full
body
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
this
ausie
brew
is
up
there
with
the
great
stouts
of
ireland
and
england
two
thumbs
up
and
a
circle
snap
d
tasty
and

very

the
12
7
fl
oz
bottle
marked

ssmpled
in

it
pours
a
midnight
brown
with
a
brown
silky
head
about
an
inch
thick
that
simmers
down
to
a
thin
ring
the
aroma
has
a
pleasant
crispness
to
it
along
with
light
chocolate
malts
and
thin
hops
subtle
would
be
the
best
word
to
describe
it
the
mouthfeel
comes
in
at
about
medium
theres
an
appealing
bitterness
quality
to
the
taste
with
a
tart
hoppy
ending
not
bad
at
all
being
in
a
thai
land
of
macro
lagers
it
is
imminently
drinkable
and
a
welcome
find
pretty
well
to
style
a
good
but
not
amazing
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
deep
garnet
highlights
and
a
good
sized
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
and
throws
some
lace
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
molasses
and
dark
dried
fruits
taste
is
very
roasty
with
hints
of
chocolate
figs
molasses
dark
fruit
and
an
annoying
mineral
or
metallic
flavor
that
while
not
overwhelming
distracts
me
a
bit
creamy
grainy
mouthfeel
medium
to
thick
body
moderate
level
of
carbonation
i
almost
enjoyed
this
one
well
i
did
drink
it
all
the
mineral
flavor
kinda
killed
this
one
for
me
these
just
became
available
in
nh
and
this
bottle
is
a
year
old
d
the
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
hurts
the
drinkability
but
you
can
enjoy
a
few
at
one
time
pours
an
opaque
coffee
brown
with
a
nice
thick
fairly
persistent
tan
head
couldnt
look
more
appetizing
aroma
is
rich
smoky
oily
having
tones
of
molasses
and
miso
flavor
is
smoky
and
has
tones
of
quality
roast
coffee
and
brown
sugar
texture
is
tingly
and
fizzy
sometimes
seeming
just
a
mite
watery
but
still
good
worthy
would
definitely
try
this
again
d
a
nice
stout
a
bit
of
everything
this
wont
make
you
dissapointed
o
good
drinkability
nice
stout
d
hadnt
had
this
one
in
a
long
time
and
forgot
how
much
i
liked
it
could
easily
have
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
i
was
suprised
that
more
of
the
sweetness
didnt
come
through
in
the
taste
pours
an
opaque
jet
black
with
about
a
finger
of
tan
foamy
head
that
lingers
awhile
the
nose
is
weak
with
light
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
dark
malts
darting
through
the
spaces
betwixt
the
air
itself
the
taste
follows
with
the
coffee
malts
subtle
bits
o
cocoa
and
twinge
of
bitterness
all
coming
in
but
sadly
seeming
somewhat
watereddown
all
of
the
flavors
perceptibly
weaker
than
they
ought
to
be
the
body
is
a
strong
medium
with
very
little
carbonation
and
though
it
lightly
coats
the
tongue
a
smooth
dry
feel
overall
a
decent
stout
but
not
quite
a
reason
to
ride
down
under
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
poured
black
light
does
not
shine
through
with
a
big
tan
creamy
head
that
hangs
around
and
laces
nicely
heavey
roasted
malt
aroma
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
coffeechocolate
bitterness
and
a
pleasant
smokey
finish
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
very
good
stout
in
all
a
very
good
stout
i
must
admit
i
didnt
expect
that
from
australia
an
okay
mouthfeel
could
h
ave
been
a
little
fuller
though
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
especially
for
the
price
a
good
solid
stout
very
dark
with
a
giant
creamy
espresso
head
that
hung
around
for
the
whole
glass
ample
chocolatey
roasted
kind
of
flavours
but
a
touch
more
subdued
than
some
well
carbonated
smooth
with
a
pleasant
long
finish
wont
blow
your
mind
but
it
shouldnt
need
to
12
7
oz
bottle
to
glass
best
after
date
of
april
2009
about
10
mo
old
really
cheap
label
if
you
care
i
dont
pours
very
dark
almost
black
tan
rocky
foamy
head
roasted
aromas
this
was
pretty
much
the
most
bitter
stout
ive
had
cant
tell
if
its
the
roastburnt
flavors
or
hops
or
carbonation
or
alcohol
or
too
young
or
combination
some
malt
and
coffee
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
but
not
bad
decent
overall
slightly
above
average
taste
for
the
style
appearance
was
okay
but
docked
a
half
point
for
extreme
sediment
sediment
in
a
stout
wtf
was
coopers
thinking
average
score
equals
average
score
burnt
and
roasted
notes
through
and
through
mild
dark
fruit
is
noticed
if
you
try
hard
and
get
the
tartness
in
the
finish
thin
mouthfeel
hard
to
finish
it
to
even
34
which
i
did
knowing
the
chunks
of
sediment
will
find
their
way
into
your
mouth
the
beer
was
velvety
smooth
inspite
of
above
average
carbonation
bearing
testimony
to
the
impact
of
the
big
flavour
it
has
to
offer
i
would
certainly
be
looking
out
for
this
beer
again
frankly
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
one
d
this
is
an
excellent
stout
and
my
first
foray
into
the
world
of
coopers
im
impressed
and
am
also
a
bit
curious
to
try
some
of
coopers
other
brews
i
could
probably
session
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
7
stubby
bottle
almost
ink
black
in
color
with
very
little
head
awesome
smell
first
off
dark
coffee
and
a
hint
of
some
dried
fruits
such
as
plums
very
creamy
mouthfeel
dark
roasted
chocolate
big
roasted
malts
and
nutlike
creamy
flavor
full
bodied
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
coopers
that
i
have
tried
drinkability
might
be
hindered
by
the
full
flavor
of
this
brew
a
sipper
in
my
mind
really
solid
atmosphere
dark
and
ominous
appearance
really
full
pleasing
nose
great
combination
of
elements
in
the
nose
and
palette
well
balanced
with
a
little
complexity
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
this
is
a
fine
stout
better
than
others
of
the
style
i
have
tried
an
australian
gem
of
a
beer
a
nice
stout
that
pours
deep
deep
brown
with
an
almost
white
head
i
had
two
that
night
because
i
was
so
intrigued
first
is
english
porter
fruit
quite
a
bit
of
sweet
apple
and
grape
a
tad
sherry
quality
the
second
was
straight
up
plum
and
apple
malt
the
palate
was
a
decent
body
for
a
earthy
mild
smokiness
that
gave
way
to
a
very
mild
sour
quality
i
had
both
a
tad
warm
as
the
palate
was
very
bland
otherwise
alcohol
comes
through
a
bit
as
a
sherry
quality
finish
of
shiraz
grape
vanilla
bean
very
interesting
with
a
subtle
tobacco
earth
quite
a
surprise
how
wonderful
d
huge
waves
of
lace
and
foam
til
the
last
sip
this
extra
stout
looks
perfect
tastes
good
and
feels
fine
which
really
makes
it
one
easy
drinking
extra
stout
a
pleasant
treat
from
the
land
down
under
drinkabilityits
a
nice
breweasily
available
here
and
would
buy
again
overall
a
solid
stout
that
i
would
gladly
revisit
nearly
opaque
nice
full
creamy
head
smells
nice
with
some
sweetness
mild
coffee
and
good
malts
the
taste
is
on
par
with
the
smell
with
some
added
faint
anise
complex
with
good
balance
of
bitter
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
good
though
slightly
thin
but
still
full
bodied
great
drinkability
this
was
tasty
and
easy
to
put
back
many
c
see
above
d
this
beer
has
a
light
flavor
but
good
roasted
flavors
however
there
are
not
much
malt
flavor
or
depth
to
the
beer
this
one
falls
on
the
top
part
of
my
list
coopers
best
extra
stout
is
a
great
export
it
appears
to
be
light
for
its
class
but
once
in
the
glass
gains
its
stoutlike
characteristics
has
a
strong
aroma
of
coffee
and
malted
hops
follow
it
right
up
its
easy
on
the
mouth
smooth
all
over
the
taste
buds
with
just
enough
sweet
to
mesh
well
with
the
bitterness
pairs
well
with
a
good
tobacco
wether
it
be
a
fine
cigar
or
in
my
case
a
briar
pipe
packs
a
descent
punch
in
the
content
category
and
for
the
most
part
you
dont
realize
it
until
your
three
or
for
in
coopers
stout
has
heavy
notes
of
chocolate
from
start
to
finish
and
in
my
opinion
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
out
there
a
little
expensive
in
the
six
packs
but
i
got
mine
in
a
mix
and
match
so
cant
complain
about
that
certainnly
an
interesting
stout
which
is
definately
worth
a
try
or
two
recommended
drinkability
worth
a
try
by
no
means
a
bad
lil
robust
stout
and
probably
one
of
the
better
brews
ive
had
from
the
coopers
brewery
over
these
many
long
years
wow
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
cant
believe
i
havnt
tried
yet
until
today
it
pours
a
jet
black
cola
colour
with
nice
carbonation
that
leaves
a
one
finger
creamy
head
that
dissapates
slowly
to
reveal
some
very
nice
lacing
everywhere
all
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
lets
no
light
thru
whatsoeverthe
aroma
is
strong
dark
coffeedark
fruits
and
dark
chocolate
coated
coffee
beans
very
niceit
has
a
nice
weighty
mouthfeel
to
it
with
big
hints
of
chocolate
and
strong
dark
cofffee
the
most
prevalent
with
a
subtle
ting
of
some
hop
bitterness
right
at
the
endthis
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
cant
believe
has
taken
me
this
long
to
discover
and
will
be
buying
it
again
without
a
doubt
d
overall
this
is
a
damn
good
stout
everything
about
it
is
good
and
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
worth
trying
sometime

this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
coopers
attempt
at
an
export
stout
nothing
is
overly
exciting
but
everything
is
very
solid
worth
a
shot
drinkability
speaking
it
is
a
well
balanced
beer
and
i
enjoyed
the
robust
roastiness
this
brings
to
the
table
drinkability
this
is
a
relatively
thickbodied
aboveaveragealcohol
stout
with
complex
flavors
its
tasty
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
pint
after
pint
one
is
good
though
a
very
ashy
fullon
stout
my
shout
mates
my
wanker
friends
in
oz
would
laugh
but
what
do
they
know
theyre
drinking
bud
because
its
an
import
this
is
a
damn
fine
stout
and
not
because
it
feels
good
or
looks
good
but
because
it
flat
out
tastes
good
its
the
only
coopers
entry
worth
a
shout
and
admittedly
i
am
the
last
person
your
should
take
advice
from
but
try
it
it
is
of
course
drinkable
because
theres
nothing
outwardly
unpleasant
about
this
it
certainly
has
good
moments
but
the
flavour
is
weak
and
simple
and
there
just
isnt
enough
to
this
if
i
were
pressed
id
want
to
refer
to
this
as
a
girls
stout
but
really
i
just
think
its
a
poor
one
yes
pour
your
waves
of
hate
on
me
female
beer
drinkers
the
taste
is
very
creamy
and
well
carbonated
for
a
stout
of
any
variety
there
is
a
nice
balance
with
the
bittering
hop
and
the
roasted
chocolate
notes
and
dark
malts
the
creaminess
the
carbonation
the
pleasant
balance
with
the
hops
and
roasted
caramel
notes
make
this
a
very
enjoyable
stout
d
this
is
dangerously
drinkable
it
goes
down
nicely
the
6
3
abv
is
well
hidden
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
a
few
you
wouldnt
want
more
than
2
or
3
but
overall
this
is
quite
good
seems
bc
has
a
lot
of
coopers
around
6
at
last
counting
this
is
a
real
solid
stout
with
a
full
mouthfeel
and
that
kinda
rough
finish
that
seems
to
be
an
aussie
stout
thing
sheaf
is
kinda
the
same
though
this
is
a
better
beer
i
liked
the
way
once
it
warmed
up
the
roasty
notes
came
out
in
the
nose
and
the
flavour
opened
up
too
worth
picking
up
final
say
a
good
stout
i
feel
if
the
flavours
i
noted
were
more
intense
i
would
be
in
love
with
this
brew
it
left
me
with
a
little
disappointment
only
because
it
came
so
close
to
really
hitting
the
spot
for
me
no
real
faults
here
and
i
think
i
need
to
come
back
to
this
as
i
had
this
after
a
long
days
work
in
a
smoky
environment
and
maybe
this
dulled
me
to
the
aromas
and
flavours
somewhat
drinkability
excellent
recommended
summary
liquid
sustenance
for
times
like
these
so
bad
it
was
the
bars
last
one
in
the
cooler
d
i
probably
will
not
be
getting
this
beer
again
i
prefer
other
stouts
over
this
one
i
wasnt
completely
disappointed
but
i
wasnt
extremely
impressed
either
md
lightly
carbonated
and
dry
from
hops
with
a
light
syrup
feeling
not
very
drinkable
for
me
definitely
will
not
purchase
again
this
is
my
first
cooper
brew
after
this
one
im
interested
in
what
else
they
have
pours
a
pitch
black
colored
body
with
some
suspended
particles
has
a
small
creamy
head
tan
in
color
with
good
lacing
a
nice
roasted
coffee
aroma
some
vanilla
maybe
dark
chocolate
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
sweet
milky
taste
very
good
overall
the
mouth
feel
is
carbonated
and
dry
the
body
is
medium
full
body
the
finish
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
this
beer
has
a
better
nose
than
the
taste
although
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
it
is
nice
and
easy
to
drink
i
just
would
have
like
to
have
the
nose
and
the
taste
match
more
evenly
overall
not
the
best
stout
out
there
but
a
solid
contender
subtle
nuanced
and
enjoyable
this
is
what
a
good
stout
should
be
recommended
drinkability
the
lighter
mouthfeel
and
subtle
flavors
would
allow
me
to
drink
a
few
of
these
before
i
got
tired
of
it
in
general
though
i
prefer
a
stronger
taste
in
my
stouts
notes
from
122305
deep
black
in
color
with
no
real
apparent
head
or
carbonation
very
faint
ink
like
aroma
and
not
much
more
some
mild
roasted
flavors
deep
roasted
bite
at
first
then
nothingfairly
one
dimensional
ok
hop
bite
rather
thin
and
watery
body
wise
i
had
high
hope
for
this
beerdont
know
why
but
i
did
rather
a
bit
of
a
let
down
there
is
better
out
there
trust
me
as
an
australian
who
avoids
a
lot
of
australian
beers
i
think
this
is
one
to
be
proud
of
rating
to
style
this
is
a
worldclass
export
stout
pours
a
dark
black
14
inch
tan
head
with
low
retention
and
low
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malts
and
mostly
caramelchocolate
fits
the
style
very
smooth
mouth
feel
and
low
carbonation
level
slightly
chewy
feel
but
not
too
thick
there
is
a
noticeable
hop
bitterness
but
it
quickly
dissipates
into
a
strong
roasted
malt
flavor
overall
really
smooth
and
not
too
thick
worth
a
try
has
a
layer
of
yeast
in
the
bottom
from
bottle
conditioning
pours
a
dark
black
with
no
clarity
thin
off
white
head
that
disspates
quickly
into
a
nice
collar
very
little
laciness
mainly
coffee
in
the
nose
taste
seemed
water
downed
but
had
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
somewhat
sweet
not
much
body
to
this
beer
thin
and
watery
texture
not
a
great
beer
would
not
seek
out
as
a
session
beer
d
while
this
beer
is
very
tasty
it
is
also
very
heavy
one
of
these
would
probably
fill
you
up
even
more
so
than
guinness
i
would
say
i
quite
like
the
drinkability
of
one
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
much
more
than
that
overall
a
very
fine
dark
stout
that
lives
up
to
its
name
i
would
prefer
this
over
guinness
any
day
this
went
down
extremely
easy
no
harsh
flavors
or
anything
that
dominates
balanced
i
wanted
to
buy
just
a
single
in
case
it
sucked
but
due
to
the
nature
of
the
6pack
packaging
had
to
go
all
in
glad
i
did
6
3
alcohol
will
sneak
up
on
me
after
a
few
of
these
but
it
will
be
worth
it
i
got
the
least
6
in
the
store
and
will
definitely
be
buying
this
again
very
drinkable
beer
very
happy
with
my
purchase
will
drink
this
again
sucked
in
by
coopers
again
pours
very
nice
black
thick
with
no
head
aroma
is
good
nice
toasted
malt
with
coffee
and
chocolate
but
the
taste
is
so
underwhelming
caramel
and
earthy
flavors
mix
with
the
malt
and
coffee
but
it
just
tastes
so
weak
it
is
almost
like
someone
intentionally
watered
it
down
becuase
they
ran
out
its
also
not
cheap
spend
your
money
elsewhere
drinkability
rich
to
the
flavour
decently
poised
between
the
taste
and
smell
great
mouthfeel
shure
a
bit
heavy
but
me
likey
likey
and
so
do
you
bells
surly
floyds
founders
great
lakes
dont
worry
coopers
wont
be
taking
over
your
corner
of
the
market
on
stouts
and
porters
any
time
soon
wow
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
foreign
export
stout
d
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
guinness
extra
stout
should
give
this
a
shot
its
nice
a
dry
and
has
some
easy
drinking
qualities
the
abv
however
hurts
sessionability
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
possibly
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
the
flavors
and
aroma
are
brilliant
but
not
too
extreme
this
one
is
easy
drinking
and
could
easily
be
sessionable
but
its
got
enough
character
to
sip
and
enjoy
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
rather
quickly
into
a
thin
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
graham
cracker
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
cocoa
the
taste
is
full
of
roasted
malt
with
toffee
graham
cracker
and
hints
of
cocoa
and
vanilla
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
i
could
easily
drink
again
the
taste
is
chocolate
fruit
prunes
hints
of
wine
spice
and
brown
bread
it
has
toasty
hay
in
the
finish
which
is
dryish
and
has
a
light
spiciness
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
tannish
head
in
the
aroma
a
roasty
oatmeal
like
sweetness
in
the
taste
roasty
caramel
like
sweetness
and
just
a
hint
of
piney
hops
a
small
bitterness
and
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
roasty
aftertaste
a
nice
stout
but
just
over
average
nice
hops
and
sweet
oatmeal
drinkability
is
absolutely
fine
for
another
comparable
but
cheaper
aussie
stout
try
abbotsford
invalid
both
are
enjoyable
d
good
drinkability
rich
in
flavor
but
light
enough
to
enjoy
in
multiples
and
wont
fill
you
up
this
beer
is
one
you
would
drink
in
autumn
or
any
chilly
night
would
go
well
with
smoked
gouda
and
maybe
a
smoked
extra
sharp
cheddar
i
havent
had
many
of
this
style
but
coopers
is
a
good
one
i
didnt
like
this
quite
as
much
as
lion
stout
but
better
than
any
of
the
american
versions
ive
had
nicely
done
pretty
bonzer
mate
a
fair
dinkum
my
first
coopers
and
its
not
bad
at
all
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
one
again
at
6
3
you
wouldnt
want
to
session
on
these
and
i
could
only
drink
them
in
cooler
weather
a
good
looking
stout
with
a
thick
off
white
head
fading
slowly
to
lace
over
a
dark
brown
body
with
a
bit
of
red
at
the
edges
when
backlit
maybe
its
a
little
cold
off
of
this
particular
tap
but
the
aroma
isnt
overly
exciting
little
bit
of
chocolate
roastiness
but
the
good
chocolate
malt
qualities
come
through
quite
nicely
in
the
taste
nice
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
adequate
carbonation
a
good
drinkable
stout
id
have
this
again
seems
to
be
missing
something
but
theres
a
lot
to
like
and
not
anything
to
truly
dislike
nice
effort
an
incredibly
balanced
drinkable
export
stout
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
to
this
point
a
good
beer
on
its
own
but
the
smokey
flavors
makes
this
very
intriguing
to
pour
onto
bbqd
meats
recommended
poured
a
very
dark
blackbrown
with
a
small
brown
head
there
are
decent
sized
waxy
white
particles
floating
around
in
my
glass
the
bottom
of
the
glass
looks
like
the
bottom
of
a
fish
tank
the
pebble
sediment
is
kind
of
a
turn
off
here
but
i
should
have
listened
to
the
label
the
aroma
is
malty
and
sweet
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
flavor
is
roasty
and
sweet
with
just
enough
hops
to
work
but
i
prefer
more
slightly
dry
feel
is
moderate
and
slick
with
a
good
amount
of
tingly
from
the
carbonation
this
is
quite
drinkable
a
slightly
above
average
stout
overall
an
above
average
stout
but
nothing
exceptional
poured
black
with
a
brown
head
that
dissipates
to
a
slight
ring
i
didnt
get
much
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
burnt
roastiness
the
flavor
is
mostly
of
a
burnt
roast
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
it
has
a
somewhat
smooth
oily
texture
the
bitterness
is
at
a
good
level
subdued
by
the
roast
malt
overall
not
a
bad
stout
but
it
does
not
shout
out
drink
me
again
poured
a
really
dark
chocolate
colour
with
a
bubbly
head
that
disappeared
to
leave
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
very
much
of
malt
barley
and
coffee
nice
strong
stouty
flavour
but
a
bit
sweeter
than
what
im
used
to
has
a
rather
caramelly
aftertaste
and
a
slight
bite
mouthfeel
is
what
id
expect
from
a
stout
nice
and
chewy
i
could
drink
these
all
night
not
the
best
and
certainly
not
the
worst
maybe
i
had
this
beer
on
a
nonstout
day
beer
feels
a
bit
fizzy
while
festering
on
pallette
something
i
dont
usually
notice
in
a
stout
i
do
not
find
this
beer
to
be
as
bitter
as
described
by
some
others
all
in
all
this
is
still
a
decent
overall
stout
an
unexpectedly
fresh
and
highly
drinkable
stout
i
like
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
full
bodied
and
full
flavored
brew
with
all
the
flavors
present
to
make
a
great
stout
the
profile
is
great
but
the
coffee
seems
to
dominate
a
bit
too
much
leaving
the
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
in
the
background
regardless
a
solidly
crafted
stout
cheers
overall
not
my
thing
but
i
guess
im
not
a
fan
of
export
stouts
to
begin
with
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
paired
with
some
outstanding
food
at
my
friends
coffee
house
in
fort
myers
i
was
impressed
with
it
poured
a
dark
chocolate
brown
the
nose
has
a
nice
earthy
brewed
coffee
smell
the
taste
was
robust
with
mellow
dark
brewed
coffee
notes
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
not
too
shabby
for
an
organic
beer
had
this
one
at
outback
best
after
date
307
aged
for
me
i
guess
pours
a
deep
brownishblack
w
a
med
brown
head
flecked
w
darker
cirlcles
around
the
bubbles
leaving
a
decent
lacing
in
my
glass
not
a
strong
smell
some
hints
of
coffee
and
alcohol
a
bit
of
wood
noticed
an
interesting
taste
an
earthy
darkly
roasted
coffee
flavor
finishes
w
a
faint
dirt
note
no
hop
presence
a
lightmed
body
moderate
co2
a
drinkable
brew
for
sure
esp
for
6
3
abv
id
def
drink
this
one
again
d
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
example
of
a
stout
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
can
think
of
several
others
id
choose
before
it
d
this
is
a
very
good
stout
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
quality
of
this
import
from
australia
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
perhaps
not
my
favorite
not
surprisingly
this
reminds
me
of
homebrews
made
with
coopers
malt
extract
i
have
been
craving
stouts
lately
and
this
one
does
not
dissapoint
i
love
the
dry
finish
its
really
dry
but
it
manages
to
avoid
being
burnt
or
ashy
my
only
experience
with
coopers
previous
to
this
is
their
awful
homebrew
kits
so
this
is
quite
impressive
d
good
nightcap
alcohol
content
keeps
me
from
drinking
multiples
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
despite
all
the
carbonation
thanks
to
the
bottle
conditioning
but
still
feels
kinda
weak
overall
this
stout
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
dopplebock
with
its
medium
body
and
soft
yeasty
character
overall
finish
too
short
not
terribly
complex
up
to
five
years
of
bottle
age
could
do
it
some
good
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
and
body
to
evolve
significantly
an
easy
drinking
stout
best
served
at
about
6
c
in
terms
of
flavor
and
smell
this
beer
rivals
the
irish
offerings
i
like
the
fact
this
stout
has
a
little
less
body
than
others
i
wouldnt
call
it
watery
though
it
has
a
beautiful
chocolatey
and
roasty
aroma
but
this
didnt
translate
equally
to
the
flavour
its
not
bad
but
a
bit
too
roasty
and
burnt
toast
which
puts
it
out
of
balance
if
you
let
it
warm
up
it
becomes
a
bit
more
malty
with
treacle
notes
i
thought
it
was
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
both
with
food
and
just
on
its
own
good
but
not
great
its
a
bit
strongfull
for
a
session
beer
but
it
still
has
quite
the
drinkability
especially
when
paired
with
shell
fish
such
as
mussels
or
clams
and
oysters
i
presume
overall
enjoyable
and
a
welcome
addition
to
my
otherwise
limited
selection
of
good
beer
here
in
beijing
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
okay
its
fairly
drinkable
but
limited
by
its
somewhat
bland
flavor
overall
its
an
okay
beer
worth
a
try
drinkability
a
good
beer
from
coopers
easy
drinking
not
heavy
and
not
thin
d
brew
is
rather
filling
so
sessions
could
be
a
chore
but
wonderful
complexity
of
brew
is
wonderful
recommended
d
if
one
wanted
a
session
stout
i
would
recommend
this
one
as
it
does
not
tire
the
mouth
with
any
overkill
quite
drinkable
and
probably
the
most
interest
beer
for
a
beer
enthusiast
from
coopers
this
is
no
guinness
fes
but
it
is
a
decent
introduction
to
the
fes
style
of
beer
decent
mellow
beer
that
i
can
see
drinking
again
pours
a
dark
inkblack
color
with
a
onefinger
head
sediment
on
the
bottom
due
to
the
bottleconditioning
aroma
is
thick
and
strong
and
reminiscent
of
dark
coffee
some
cocoa
aroma
as
well
taste
is
strong
and
interesting
hints
of
mostly
dark
coffee
stand
out
in
the
middle
roasty
and
slightly
creamy
finishes
dry
at
the
back
of
the
throat
with
the
roastiness
second
to
none
a
second
sip
confims
the
same
thing
definitely
strong
as
an
export
stout
should
be
somewhat
better
than
guinness
effort
but
if
theres
one
thing
id
change
about
this
beer
id
exploit
the
cocoa
notes
more
and
improve
the
creaminess
still
a
decent
export
stout
and
you
cant
really
argue
with
something
that
sticks
to
the
style
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
was
as
dark
as
night
with
a
creamy
12
inch
brown
head
upon
first
smell
i
noticed
a
sweetness
almost
taffy
like
and
strong
coffee
there
was
also
a
roasted
smell
first
sip
you
have
a
coffee
taste
with
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
in
the
background
not
as
heavy
as
i
though
but
a
nice
light
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
just
enjoy
definitely
worth
a
try
body
is
nice
rich
and
creamy
like
a
good
stout
should
be
this
is
an
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
stout
excellent
flavor
and
body
show
this
one
to
be
a
great
example
of
an
export
stout
i
wish
this
was
available
in
oregon
until
it
is
ill
just
have
to
continue
buying
it
in
washington
it
used
to
be
hard
for
me
to
find
this
one
but
it
seems
to
be
gaining
popularity

actually
just
the
typical
stout
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
that
shines
in
the
most
important
category
taste
id
recommend
you
pick
this
one
up
when
you
see
it
im
not
a
huge
stout
drinker
so
the
chances
of
me
going
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
or
any
other
stout
is
rather
slim
i
definately
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
though
it
has
certainly
done
the
australian
beer
world
proud
d
insanely
drinkable
for
a
stout
a
rare
style
but
is
drinkable
in
all
occasions
from
a
140
degree
day
in
the
outback
to
a
cold
winters
night
used
to
be
able
to
pick
up
a
750
from
hitimes
for
2
87
plus
tax
hope
they
bring
those
back
for
me
this
is
australian
for
beer
really
all
id
want
in
a
stout
german
weizen
good
stout
for
sure
could
drink
a
couple
in
a
row
no
problems
but
that
would
be
about
it
pours
black
ruby
highlights
milk
chocolate
head
and
nice
lacing
textbook
stout
appearance
nose
is
a
nice
mix
of
dark
roast
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
ash
flavor
is
a
lot
roasty
up
front
with
not
much
else
discernible
but
some
dark
maltiness
the
finish
however
brings
some
vinous
qualities
as
well
as
some
chocolate
and
prunes
aftertaste
is
an
awesome
espresso
bean
roastiness
that
lingers
forever
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
the
carbonation
could
chill
out
a
bit
a
fine
drinkable
stout
after
having
had
their
sparkling
ale
and
being
extremely
disappointed
with
it
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
tried
this
with
some
queso
mahón
which
goes
alright
with
it
but
i
think
this
beer
needs
a
cheese
with
more
punch
to
it
to
stand
up
to
the
intense
roastiness
ehh
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
wouldnt
order
one
overall
this
is
just
a
great
stout
and
an
outstanding
offering
from
coopers
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier
its
great
that
its
so
widely
available
here
in
australia
i
discovered
and
instantly
loved
these
brews
when
i
first
came
to
australia
and
use
them
as
my
goto
beers
particularly
the
best
extra
stout
i
have
to
say
that
the
aged
version
of
this
beer
coopers
special
stout
is
even
better
ample
tan
head
which
sticks
like
glue
to
the
glass
this
is
the
beer
equivalent
of
a
black
hole
no
light
can
escape
it
complex
on
the
nose
golden
syrup
blackcurrant
plums
the
taste
is
a
letdown
after
the
promising
aroma
the
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
depth
of
other
stouts
in
the
same
market
the
body
is
quite
thin
though
the
alcohol
is
very
well
disguised
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
there
arent
really
any
flaws
to
this
beer
but
there
isnt
really
anything
all
that
special
about
it
either
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
choice
of
hops
as
it
doesnt
meld
with
the
whole
flavor
profile
though
there
is
some
alcohol
to
this
beer
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
of
malt
in
there
to
support
it
in
the
mouthfeel
and
the
finish
i
would
take
a
number
of
stouts
over
this
one
but
it
doesnt
suck
i
would
drink
it
again
if
it
were
paired
next
to
budweiser
and
even
heineken
but
if
it
was
sitting
next
to
an
obsidian
there
would
be
no
contest
the
taste
started
malty
with
a
sweet
molasses
feel
to
it
before
finishing
roasty
and
dry
with
a
slight
coffee
bitterness
medium
body
that
was
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
and
carbonation
that
felt
a
bit
too
abrasive
for
the
style
those
are
quibbles
though
and
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
poured
thick
and
dark
left
a
very
small
bubbly
head
which
disappeared
quickly
faint
aroma
of
roasted
barley
and
bitter
chocolate
the
beer
had
a
faint
roasted
flavor
but
the
flavor
in
general
was
subtle
i
usually
prefer
a
stronger
flavor
but
this
was
good
none
the
less
looking
past
the
carbonation
this
is
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
look
for
anyone
who
likes
stouts
in
general
coopers
best
extra
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
from
a
brown
12
7
ounce
bottle
which
has
yeast
residue
in
it
the
aroma
is
a
bit
estery
and
i
pick
up
a
little
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
a
bit
estery
at
first
but
then
its
roasted
malt
all
the
way
recommended
this
is
just
one
outstanding
beer
i
think
this
may
become
one
of
the
regulars
in
my
fridge
as
it
has
a
high
availability
with
a
good
price
im
just
in
love
with
this
beer
the
full
flavor
the
smooth
taste
the
hints
of
chocolate
everything
about
this
beer
is
delicious
when
you
take
that
first
sip
good
luck
putting
the
glass
down
you
wont
even
need
a
coaster
drinkability
its
a
better
than
average
stout
probably
a
good
one
for
guinness
drinker
to
try
i
dig
all
of
the
roasty
flavors
but
i
wish
there
was
more
complexity
on
the
light
side
of
stouts
crisp
and
cool
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
go
for
another
12
7
ounce
bottle
stamped
best
before
30

07
so
were
doing
alright
for
freshness
served
at
cellar
temperature
into
a
17
ounce
snifter
decanted
carefully
so
as
to
avoid
mixing
any
of
the
chunky
white
particulates
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
in
with
the
beer
deep
obsidian
with
a
persistent
but
steadily
thinning
khaki
head
sour
vinous
aromas
of
blackberries
and
rumsoaked
currants
with
a
few
cherry
cordial
notes
here
and
there
somewhat
colaish
as
well
very
interesting
taste
experience
with
vinous
berry
and
tart
apple
brandy
flavors
up
front
moving
into
a
muted
soft
cocoa
middle
that
never
speaks
at
a
level
above
a
whisper
and
finally
a
very
enjoyable
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
bean
finish
the
long
aftertaste
here
just
about
redeems
any
strange
or
unexpected
qualities
of
the
flavor
profile
feels
thin
on
the
palate
at
first
it
gains
more
body
as
the
lively
peppery
mouthfeel
expands
throughout
the
swallow
and
sets
up
residence
feels
just
slightly
chalky
at
times
too
a
worthy
representation
of
the
style
no
doubt
drinkability
a
good
beer
with
well
blended
flavors
a
little
more
bite
from
carbonation
than
i
typically
like
in
my
stouts
overall
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
not
amazing
but
still
a
solid
brew
i
got
a
rich
roasted
and
smokey
aroma
followed
by
a
similar
taste
there
was
more
chocolate
a
bit
of
bitter
coffee
in
the
flavor
along
with
that
dark
candy
flavor
found
in
riss
and
export
stouts
this
is
good
beer
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
at
a
decent
price

poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
chocolate
forming
a
small
head
that
quickly
faded
but
leaving
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
roasted
coffee
with
the
flavor
very
much
the
same
but
with
the
slight
addition
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
like
expected
from
a
stout
i
could
easily
enjoy
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
a
very
enjoyable
stout
and
a
fine
offering
from
coopers
brewery
this
beer
is
not
bad
at
all
and
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
one
time
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
with
a
modest
head
that
dissipates
quickly
there
are
bits
of
yeast
floating
throughout
has
a
molasses
and
dark
malt
smell
fullbodied
and
quite
tasty
coffee
and
malty
molasses
most
present
all
things
considered
a
pretty
enjoyable
stout
when
i
opened
this
bottle
i
noticed
a
strange
smell
sort
of
like
cough
syrup
it
faded
as
i
progressed
through
the
beer
but
the
aroma
never
did
hit
me
right
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
and
carbonated
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
blackbrown
opaque
beer
the
taste
was
pretty
good
though
a
bit
chocolaty
but
it
was
slightly
dry
and
crisp
drinks
pretty
easy
a
pretty
nice
stout
id
certainly
buy
this
again
i
enjoyed
this
beer
in
that
coopers
didnt
feel
like
they
had
to
make
this
syrupy
thick
or
sweet
to
be
a
good
stout
pours
from
the
bottle
to
an
opaque
black
with
dark
tan
head
that
lingers
and
yields
to
good
lacing
aroma
is
malty
chocolatetoffee
and
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
good
medium
bodied
stout
that
leaves
a
nice
smooth
finish
outside
the
workmens
jackhammers
sound
like
alarm
bells
their
voices
like
shouting
on
the
beach
first
beer
by
this
brewery
that
i
really
liked
very
bold
and
characterful
pours
a
viscous
jet
black
beer
that
promises
a
lot
of
flavor
smells
a
melded
roastedness
with
cocoa
nuts
and
cream
tastes
quite
strong
with
the
roasted
barley
and
cocoa
with
background
tones
of
nuts
lactose
and
fermentation
yeastiness
very
malty
evident
in
flavor
and
heavy
feel
finishes
with
a
heavy
coffee
roastedness
very
tasty
but
i
would
prefer
a
lighter
milkstout
quality
an
sweetness
overall
quite
good
and
im
glad
to
have
run
across
this
ozzie
beer
mild
sharpness
from
the
roast
grain
with
a
bitterness
that
is
moderate
but
does
not
dominate
lightmedium
bodied
with
some
alcohol

on
the
palate
also
some
fruity
esters
present
medium
carbonation
and
some
lingering
bitterness
dry
finish
with
a
lingering
roast
aftertaste
the
roast
and
alcohol
complement
each
other
well
lending
the
beer
good
flavour
without
being
too
large
drinkability
pretty
good
but
an
odd
chalky
aftertaste
bottle
says
best
before
41106
i
bought
it
last
month
a
single
bottle
and
didnt
pay
attention
to
the
freshness
date
oh
well
ill
drink
it
anyway
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
very
small
head
with
goes
away
pretty
quickly
it
smells
like
coffee
milk
chocolate
and
malt
but
the
aroma
isnt
strong
luckily
the
taste
is
stronger
with
it
tasting
like
coffee
malt
and
dark
fruits
theres
also
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
it
doesnt
linger
for
too
long
it
has
a
medium
body
with
a
decent
mouthfeel
with
moderate
carbonation
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
its
good
and
drinkable
hopefully
the
next
time
i
drink
this
it
will
be
within
its
freshness
date
but
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
and
id
like
to
try
it
again
d
it
took
a
few
sips
to
warm
up
to
but
i
am
starting
to
like
this
beer
for
its
uniqueness
i
havent
had
a
stout
quite
like
this
one
before
and
will
probably
have
more
in
the
future
extremely
easy
to
drink
beer
simple
and
sure
to
please
any
stout
lover
and
stout
liker
equally
most
drinkable
stout
ive
ever
had
poured
a
virtually
black
color
with
moderate
tannish
head
smell
is
truly
fantastic
with
strong
coffee
chocolate
dark
fruit
figs
raisins
prunes
and
roasted
malt
combining
in
perfect
proportions
the
taste
if
possible
is
even
better
than
the
smell
with
the
fruits
chocolate
coffee
and
malt
tasting
perfect
finishes
with
just
the
right
combination
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
yet
to
try
truly
a
winner
this
beer
is
outstanding
im
a
big
guinness
extra
stout
fan
and
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
admit
coopers
whips
it
ass
everything
you
drink
guinness
for
and
more
is
found
in
coopers
the
major
difference
for
me
was
a
much
smoother
less
bitter
aftertaste
cant
get
it
at
home
so
i
loaded
up
on
this
stuff
during
my
last
trip
to
sc
and
have
savored
it
ever
since
im
hoarding
this
stuff
like
a
miser
rationing
one
bottle
at
a
time
a
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
s
mild
coffee
and
cocoa
t
robust
and
flavorful
but
not
obtrusive
or
overwhelming
m
a
little
thinner
than
usually
found
in
a
lot
of
stouts
but
it
compliments
the
overall
character
of
this
beer
so
i
did
not
penalize
them
for
it
d
first
drank
this
on
a
90
plus
degree
day
after
walking
for
over
a
mile
and
could
have
easily
sessioned
it
thumbs
up
easy
to
drink
and
just
as
likeable
that
is
a
winning
combination
imo
is
this
the
best
export
stout
ive
had
no
so
what
it
is
good
and
id
happily
drink
it
again
i
just
might
too
as
i
can
get
sixpacks
in
council
bluffs
ia
my
bottle
is
dated
04
11
06
ive
neglected
it
my
dbf
for
too
long
i
wonder
if
this
would
be
even
better
ultra
fresh
coopers
original
pale
ale
well
sucked
coopers
has
rallied
with
this
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
of
the
coopers
beers
i
have
i
purchased
this
bottle
in
lawrence
ks
worth
a
try
this
is
a
good
stout
i
just
drank
coopers
sparkling
ale
and
was
very
impressed
its
been
years
since
ive
had
coopers
beers
im
sorry
ive
taken
this
long
to
try
them
again
at
less
that
1
50
a
bottle
here
in
sarasota
they
are
a
great
value
pours
out
black
in
the
glass
with
a
very
tiny
but
very
dark
head
that
evaporates
quite
quickly
smells
like
coffee
with
like
a
lot
of
hazelnut
creamer
tastes
very
lightly
chocolatey
but
too
watery
not
much
body
to
speak
of
highly
drinkable
due
to
wateriness
but
not
cuz
of
flavor
still
better
than
their
sparkling
ale
dense
black
with
a
loud
fizzy
tan
head
that
quickly
dissolves
into
nothing
darkly
roasted
malt
aroma
sweet
a
bit
of
coffee
and
deep
fruity
esters
blackened
burnt

flavors
bittersweet
chocolate
and
caramel
mediumfull
mouthfeel
drying
with
prickly
carbonation
pretty
tasty
d
drinkable
very
nice
brew
from
coopers
way
better
than
a
guiness
the
beer
poured
a
rich
black
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
toasty
malt
the
taste
was
of
lightly
toasted
malt
a
little
coffee
and
a
nice
alcohol
burn
the
feel
was
heavy
and
dry
this
was
a
fine
stout
to
wrap
up
a
nice
evening
of
fine
food
and
good
beer
a
stout
that
i
would
like
to
keep
on
hand
if
available
12
7
oz
bottle
with
an
interesting
shape
it
pours
black
with
ruby
tinges
and
a
small
fizzy
brown
head
the
predominant
aroma
is
sweet
blackberry
jam
but
there
are
also
notes
of
dark
chocolatecocoa
coffee
and
maybe
cherries
very
nice
the
taste
is
a
little
simpler
with
mainly
coffee
and
chocolate
and
a
medium
bitterness
it
has
a
medium
body
that
is
both
too
thin
and
a
bit
high
in
carbonation
for
my
liking
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
again
no
freshness
date
is
not
the
only
thing
strange
about
the
bottle
as
the
label
mentions
no
malts
only
water
barley
hops
and
yeast
very
nice
and
black
beer
with
litle
brown
head
make
it
a
good
performance
nose
is
very
burnt
caramellic
and
sweet
malted
grassy
and
porty
taste
is
also
roasted
but
missing
bit
of
that
oily
i
love
in
stouts
good
alcoholtouch
without
beeing
heavy
but
well
backing
the
bitterness
well
drinkable
but
you
have
to
love
it
bitter
and
burnt
md
quite
smooth
and
finecarbonated
on
the
mouthfeel
but
its
still
thinbodied
for
a
6
3
stout
imothe
sweet
edge
fails
to
buttress
the
maltiness
to
make
a
more
vertical
or
thicker
appearance
on
the
palate
although
the
finishing
touch
with
a
mild
tang
of
coffee
does
make
up
for
a
bonus
to
make
it
more
drinkable
without
falling
dull
a
solid
ale
but
showing
nothing
outofthisworld
drinkability
good
stuff
this
would
be
more
drinkable
if
it
were
a
little
more
dry
but
its
still
easy
to
sip
and
savor
and
would
fit
nicely
into
the
latter
half
of
a
session
this
beer
pured
a
very
dark
brownishblack
with
a
medium
head
the
aroma
smelled
of
roasted
malts
with
perhaps
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
to
it
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
thick
with
mediumlow
carbonation
the
taste
was
fullbodied
with
a
rich
taste
of
dark
roasted
malts
the
hop
bitterness
was
medium
and
i
felt
that
it
wasnt
too
overpowering
one
of
my
favorite
aspects
of
this
beer
with
its
nice
smooth
aftertaste
that
had
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
flavor
to
it
i
felt
this
made
it
an
exceptional
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
meal
or
all
evening
for
those
who
enjoy
a
rich
fullbodied
stout
highly
recommended
the
ebony
pour
leads
to
a
head
that
is
about
half
a
finger
in
width
nose
reminds
me
of
a
marshmellow
blackened
on
a
summer
campfire
only
not
as
sweet
thank
god
a
sweetness
mingles
with
a
dash
of
molasses
and
coffee
for
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
thick
pretty
nice
stout
that
i
could
see
myself
buying
again
if
this
was
on
tap
at
the
bar
i
could
see
myself
sessioning
this
poured
into
pint
glass
by
bartender
and
the
sediment
was
poured
as
well
not
my
ideal
pour
oh
well
dark
brown
coffee
color
with
a
medium
tan
tw
finger
cap
the
dissapeared
fast
the
smell
was
interesiting
having
floral
citrus
and
estery
aroma
almost
a
blueberry
smell
was
noticed
not
too
many
hops
were
in
nose
flavor
was
citrus
grapefruit
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
had
a
little
fusal
hops
bitterness
halfway
into
sip
mouth
feel
was
medium
with
medium
carbonation
finished
with
a
medium
dry
grapefruit
bitterness
hanging
for
a
couple
seconds
i
would
not
mind
having
one
of
these
again
but
would
look
for
something
else
what
a
great
looking
stout
beautiful
pour
with
an
edible
head
dark
and
rich
looking
doesnt
always
mean
good
tasting
but
in
this
case
it
does
delicious
coffee
and
slight
hint
of
dark
chocolate
taste
with
a
just
right
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
finish
lasts
long
enough
to
remind
you
to
open
another
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
that
stayed
the
entire
session
the
color
was
a
dark
ebony
the
aroma
was
a
faint
raosted
malts
but
not
lingering
affect
or
pungent
smell
the
taste
was
quite
good
choclate
with
some
balanced
bitterness
the
body
is
a
little
thin
but
extremely
smooth
in
the
finish
which
adds
to
its
drinkability
overall
i
would
like
to
sit
and
drink
a
few
of
these
brews
because
i
believe
this
is
a
great
brew
just
mabye
not
this
time
poured
opaque
black
with
dark
brown
edges
and
an
inch
of
light
brown
foam
loads
of
little
pieces
of
sediment
floating
around
from
the
bottle
conditioning
and
my
pour
aroma
is
of
the
roasted
black
malt
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
slight
creamydairy
taste
is
an
oily
strong
rich
mix
of
smokey
black
malts
coffee
some
dry
dark
chocolate
tones
wood
and
a
bit
of
a
yeasty
bite
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
very
interesting
and
complex
stout
from
australia
very
drinkable
as
well
this
is
the
first
stout
that
ive
had
the
oppurtunity
to
try
during
my
stay
in
melbourne
so
im
rather
excited
by
this
one
here
it
goes
pours
black
as
black
can
be
with
no
light
getting
through
what
so
ever
there
isnt
much
of
a
head
but
there
is
a
nice
sticky
tanned
lace
that
suffices
smell
is
quite
nice
with
dark
chocolate
aromas
as
well
as
some
hints
of
dark
fruit
in
the
mix
somewhere
too
taste
is
a
little
different
im
picking
up
more
coffee
tones
with
some
marshmallow
and
licorice
tastes
happening
also
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
and
very
easy
on
the
palate
drinkability
isnt
bad
at
all
either
slthough
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
then
a
few
of
these
this
beer
strikes
me
as
more
of
an
oatmeal
stout
then
anything
else
but
whatever
its
very
tasty
and
gets
my
seal
of
approval
our
eighth
beer
of
the
night
for
the
mcd
meeting
this
one
poured
black
with
a
light
tan
head
looks
a
bit
watery
chocolate
with
some
roasted
malt
odor
kind
of
a
weak
smell
a
super
roasty
flavor
some
sweet
molasseschocolatey
taste
in
there
too
cant
pick
much
else
out
of
it
but
since
the
roasty
flavor
sticks
around
it
works
overall
a
bit
weaker
than
i
like
my
stouts
to
be
but
the
taste
was
good
and
the
chocolatey
undertones
were
very
nice
id
have
it
again
lingering
smokiness
lighty
body
decent
is
being
nice
taste
is
smoky
and
bitter
coffee
some
malty
sweetness
not
much
hint
of
the
chocolate
from
the
nose
mouth
is
a
bit
thinner
than
expected
with
a
loong
lingering
coffe
bitterness
not
bad
stout
they
got
here
well
above
average
beer
is
best
enjoyed
on
cool
nights
pours
the
deepest
of
brown
colors
with
just
a
hit
of
light
coming
through
the
bottom
of
the
glass
a
very
ephemeral
head
explodes
as
it
is
poured
leaving
a
sparse
patch
over
top
that
is
maintained
by
an
active
bubble
at
the
top
of
the
beer
nose
is
very
rich
with
sweet
dark
fruit
molasses
deep
roasted
malt
and
coffee
i
would
venture
that
there
are
some
oats
in
this
one
as
well
it
has
that
creamy
essence
i
associate
with
oats
flavor
is
very
nice
and
has
a
nice
progression
from
initial
sip
to
finish
it
starts
as
roasted
to
light
burnt
malt
with
prunes
and
sharply
turns
to
a
light
chocolate
and
finally
settles
on
a
lighly
creamed
coffee
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
light
for
my
taste
its
right
at
the
lower
end
of
moderate
with
a
fairly
light
carbonation
its
just
too
close
to
water
for
me
drinkability
is
very
good
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
from
really
drinking
this
one
easily
could
be
a
beer
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
in
a
night
better
than
i
remember
it
mouthfeel
slightly
sticky
to
the
palate
and
a
comforting
thickness
this
beer
is
perfect
for
someone
who
usually
eats
chocolate
when
they
get
depressed
opaque
black
colour
with
a
thin
light
brown
head
a
little
lacing
is
left
behind
and
some
murky
yeast
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
burnt
coffee
and
a
little
chocolate
rich
roasted
coffee
malt
flavour
a
slight
yeasty
fruity
taste
appears
too
finishes
with
some
bitterness
and
chocolate
flavours
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
oily
with
mild
carbonation
overall
i
enjoyed
sipping
it
a
good
introduction
for
me
to
stouts
driankability
was
ok
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
mild
stout
a
good
aussie
stout
which
is
very
available
and
will
be
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
when
i
need
one
d
pretty
good
new
addition
to
my
fridge
overall
an
excellent
stout
highly
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
brown
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
sweet
chocolate
and
crystal
malt
scent
that
is
rich
and
creamy
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
crystal
malt
flavor
that
is
earthy
and
sweet
on
the
finish
it
has
some
chocolate
hints
as
well
as
yeasty
zing
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
decent
stout
i
love
the
aroma
but
the
flavor
has
some
defects
to
it
this
is
the
best
of
their
lineup
but
thats
not
saying
much
a
nice
offering
from
coopers
poured
out
to
a
black
coffee
color
with
a
nice
18
inch
head
of
mocha
colored
foam
some
heavy
sediment
in
the
glass
and
remaining
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
label
states
this
is
natural
and
not
undesireable
medium
level
of
carbonation
some
rings
of
lace
in
the
glass
aroma
of
bourbon
malts
roasted
grain
coffee
and
caramel
some
mellow
earthy
notes
as
well
with
a
minor
touch
of
toffee
sweetness
toward
the
finish
taste
was
very
satisfying
flavors
of
coffee
and
roasted
malt
nuts
and
grain
keep
the
tastebuds
occupied
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
like
a
old
over
brewed
coffee
id
like
to
have
this
on
tap
to
compare
it
to
the
bottle
recommended
drinkability
3
5
this
is
a
slightly
lightweight
but
still
tasty
stout
coopers
makes
a
decent
product
a
good
macro
type
of
stout
not
my
type
however
not
bad
it
is
a
stout
with
aggression
but
no
sublety
pours
crude
oil
black
with
a
coffee
tan
head
that
while
short
has
good
retention
lasting
most
of
the
glass
visible
yeast
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
which
they
mention
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
as
standard
for
its
bottle
conditioning
nose
is
strong
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
up
front
with
fruity
tones
at
the
tail
end
taste
is
roasty
espresso
chocolate
malts
with
dark
fruit
notes
in
the
finish
they
all
melt
together
into
a
nice
strong
roasted
flavor
almost
smokey
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
would
have
guessed
for
the
style
but
didnt
detract
from
the
overall
presence
of
the
beer
insanely
drinkable
seems
sessionable
even
at
6
3
the
alcohol
doesnt
make
itself
known
whatsoever
a
surprisingly
solid
brew
here
from
coopers
bottle
poured
a
thick
black
color
stout
with
a
huge
brown
creamy
head
with
excellent
retention
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
light
hops
is
clearly
detectable
taste
is
dominated
by
an
excellent
balance
between
roasted
chocolate
malt
and
light
bitter
hops
at
the
end
body
is
quite
full
and
has
an
excellent
lacingcreamy
feel
to
it
overall
an
excellent
example
of
the
foreign
stout
and
a
very
enjoyable
beer
a
very
dark
black
beer
hold
it
up
to
the
light
yep
black
has
a
small
creamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
licorice
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
in
the
background
a
robust
and
thick
roasted
malt
makes
its
precence
known
immeadiatly
in
the
flavor
notes
of
coffee
and
choclate
dance
about
on
your
tongue
with
a
hint
of
licorice
on
the
finish
yummy
overall
a
great
session
ale
and
probably
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
coopers
overall
impression
a
solid
stout
high
quality
no
flaws
d
this
is
a
geat
beer
for
bbq
and
other
events
overall
a
decent
beer
its
a
good
beer
for
an
occasional
drink
but
not
something
that
i
could
follow
with
another
notes
i
like
this
because
it
has
the
smoothness
of
a
porter
its
very
interesting
because
of
the
grainy
taste
it
has
and
its
extreme
roastiness
i
like
it
a
lot
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
one
stout
ill
definately
be
keeping
on
hand
from
now
on
coopers
best
extra
stout
delivers
the
typical
stout
appearance
with
the
notable
exception
of
some
yeast
which
settles
at
the
base
of
the
glass
beneath
its
black
body
and
creamy
tan
head
the
head
retention
could
be
better
but
it
holds
well
enough
fruity
esters
dominate
the
nose
before
you
take
a
sip
which
reveals
the
rich
caramel
and
chocolate
flavors
within
its
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
dextrinous
body
and
gentle
carbonation
from
bottle
conditioning
some
of
the
fruitiness
found
in
the
aroma
is
also
found
in
the
flavor
along
with
its
caramelchocolate
maltiness
and
a
roastiness
thats
more
genteel
than
aggressive
its
rich
and
satisfying
without
becoming
satiating
to
the
palate
and
the
yeasty
fruitiness
lends
enough
complexity
to
it
to
keep
in
interesting
nicely
done
indeed
smells
of
dark
chocolate
molasses
and
toasted
malt
tastes
toasty
sweet
malt
with
light
alcohol
taste
finishes
chocolately
with
dark
roasted
coffee
tastes
chewy
thick
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
attractive
head
throughout
at
halfglass
it
yields
more
toasted
sweetness
flavor
a
nice
brew
and
a
good
sample
of
aged
coopers
not
bad
poured
black
like
cocacola
with
a
brown
foamy
head
that
lasted
about
90
seconds
or
so
longer
than
i
would
have
thought
decent
lacing
with
the
head
completely
gone
except
for
a
lace
ring
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
bubbles
still
consistently
rise
to
the
surface
and
burst
the
smell
is
quite
a
bit
hoppier
that
i
would
have
ever
thought
in
a
pitch
black
stout
such
as
this
i
dont
like
a
lot
of
hops
and
as
such
i
gave
this
a
3
5
on
smell
the
smell
certainly
isnt
offensive
just
quite
different
than
i
was
expecting
and
not
exactly
how
i
like
a
stout
to
smell
there
are
also
some
toasted
notes
and
a
hint
of
smoke
present
here
which
is
nice
this
one
certainly
has
a
mulitfaceted
taste
first
comes
a
nice
malty
coffeelike
taste
up
front
followed
by
a
pleasantly
hoppy
bitterness
and
then
finishing
up
with
a
dry
roasted
chocolate
taste
there
is
also
a
faintly
noticeable
smokiness
all
the
way
through
many
flavour
profiles
present
here
the
mouthfeel
while
not
as
heavy
as
i
like
is
still
smooth
and
very
pleasant
this
is
indeed
a
great
brew
brilliant
an
excellent
stout
i
like
this
one
better
than
guinness
out
of
the
bottle
would
really
like
to
try
coopers
on
tap
i
could
drink
this
everyday
my
first
experience
with
coopers
brewery
limited
was
not
a
positive
one
sparkling
ale
it
had
to
have
been
a
bad
bottle
because
best
extra
stout
is
a
corker
it
has
flavor
in
spades
and
drinkability
to
spare
this
is
a
beer
that
ill
buy
in
multiples
the
next
time
i
run
across
it
drinkability
and
overall
a
solid
smooth
stout
that
will
please
all
stout
drinkers
around
a
rich
complex
and
hearty
ale
that
will
keep
you
sipping
while
far
from
the
best
stout
ive
had
id
have
to
say
this
would
be
my
choice
for
a
session
stout
try
it
n
b
this
beer
has

pours
an

is
topped
by
a

that
is
not
all
that
thick
the
aroma
is
first
of
burnt

and
then
shifts
to
a
dry

aroma
there
are
some
notes
of
sweet
coffee
in

well
the
beer
is
light
bodied
up

on
the
tongue
but
quickly
moves
to
a
mouth
coating

that
ends
in
a
dry
roasty
sensation
this
beer
is
all
about
the
simple
roast
flavors
that
dominate
the
finish
it
is
burnt
and
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
though
this
is
not
in
a
bad
way
this
beer
is
actually
pretty
simple
and
tasty
a
balance
between
the
sweet
maltiness
and
the
dry
roast
character
that
dominates
the
finish
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
sediment
in
it
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
notes
of
hazelnut
and
coconut
rind
the
taste
proceeds
in
an
interesting
fashion
by
sliding
into
the
roasty
and
chocolately
taste
and
finishing
with
a
light
cherry
none
of
the
flavors
come
on
strong
but
they
slowly
build
minimal
hop
contribution
the
beer
is
thinner
on
the
palate
than
expected

looking
at

beer

it
still
has

exceptional
as
i
had
heard
from
some
aftertaste
of
burned
caramel
toasted
with
a
barely
perceptible
comebacking
of
bittering
this
beer
poured
a
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
small
but
tight
creamy
head
no
noticeable
aroma
really
the
taste
is
a
very
nice
thick
combo
of
chocolate
coffee
and
malt
barely
any
bitterness
to
it
though
it
finishes
pretty
clean
a
very
tasty
brew
especially
on
a
cold
night
very
drinkable
another
fine
coopers
ale
roasty
black
with
good
coffee
aroma
but
then
did
not
live
up
to
its
aroma
and
presentation
watery
roast
and
not
much
else
some
yeast
in
there
not
muich
carbonation
less
pleasing
than
their
sparkling
beer
had
a
bottle
in
may
2005
that
was
much
better
and
rerated
up
enjoyable
stout
from
coopers
and
arguabley
one
of
australias
best
stouts
good
to
see
this
making
it
to
the
states
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
one
that
guinness
might
study
so
as
to
get
it
right
while
not
so
much
a
prize
as
a
great
imperial
stout
this
is
nevertheless
a
lovely
way
to
finish
off
a
meal
yummy
the
only
dark
beer
id
had
from
australia
until
this
evening
was
sheaf
stout
this
totally
blows
it
out
of
the
water
a
lovely
beer
to
pair
with
a
rich
chocolatey
dessert
appearance
dark
ruby
brown
almost
black
big
chunks
of
nice
tan
head
leaves

glad
i
finally
gave
this
jewel
a
try
smooth
carbonation
cant
complain
drinkability
pass
on
the
fosters
search
for
something
from
the
coopers
line
great
extra
stout
excellent
balance
nice
sweetness
happy
with
this
one
lightly
hoppy
the
hops
make
a
pleasant
impression
but
mildness
of
the
roast
in
the
aroma
doesnt
bode
well
the
flavor
follows
up
as
slightly
chocolatey
with
a
little
ash
the
body
is
a
bit
lively
with
makes
this
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
but
a
boring
stout
i
tried
i
really
tried
pouring
a
head
on
this
one
but
it
just
disappeared
like
that
nevertheless
it
is
black
as
night
dark
dark
and
beautiful
aroma
is
slightly
alcoholic
with
a
delicious
thick
scent
of
caramels
or
butterscotch
the
smell
is
almost
i
said
almost
cloying
imagine
that
the
taste
is
good
roasts
and
sourness
with
the
slightest
hint
of
burn
caramel
opens
the
taste
and
finishes
off
to
a
coffeeroastlike
ending
with
a
tang
of
alcohol
at
the
end
i
was
surprised
that
its
not
sweeter
considering
the
sweetness
dominates
the
aroma
it
tastes
better
than
most
other
stouts
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
okay
carbonation
is
slightly
fizzy
but
definitely
not
intrusive
it
seems
a
bit
thin
but
only
because
of
the
roast
not
backed
up
with
more
malt
alas
an
excellent
good
stout
a
very
nice
beer
smooth
tasting
and
not
too
heavy
if
it
wasnt
for
the
off
smell
maybe
i
just
have
a
bad
one
i
would
be
much
more
excited
about
this
beer
smooth
drinking
hops
added
in
at
the
end
complement
well
the
bitterness
of
the
coffee
i
could
drink
3
or
4
of
these
not
too
heavy
spunky
lightmedium
body
that
could
be
compared
to
a
pilsner
beer
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
considering
there
is
littletono
flavor
to
keep
you
away
from
it
sure
you
could
drink
a
6
pack
but
why
a
very
weak
stout
imho
much
happier
with
this
brew
the
second
time
around
a
very
good
stout
that
delivers
what
is
expected
score
adjusted
accordingly
drinkability

very
smooth
this
one
went
down
well
enough
its
not
the
heavy
hitter
that
was
hinted
at
the
nose
but
an
excellent
mediumbodied
effort
drinkability
rare
it
is
that
i
give
a
1
0
to
any
part
of
a
beers
review
you
really
have
to
earn
a
score
that
low
but
this
one
earned
it
above
i
wont
follow
up
with
another
one
here
after
all
this
could
be
a
good
stepping
stone
to
introduce
someone
to
the
stout
style
without
choking
them
on
an
appropriately
thick
stout
kind
of
like
the
cream
ale
of
stouts
i
guess
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
unless
aptly
persuaded
drinkability
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
it
would
not
be
my
first
nor
fifth
choice
of
a
stout
this
is
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
stout
i
would
buy
it
again
to
share
but
not
for
a
special
occasion
this
stout
is
colored
dead
of
the
middle
of
the
night
black
virtually
no
head
deveploped
with
my
pour
the
aroma
of
toasted
malts
was
very
prevelant
the
taste
was
a
smooth
toasted
malt
start
with
a
nice
little
bitter
hop
finish
this
has
a
moderately
heavy
mouthfeel
this
is
not
a
bad
stout
much
better
than
the
pale
ale
from
the
same
brewery
this
beer
pours
up
nice
generating
a
nice
head
but
it
fades
as
quickly
after
is
builds
the
appearance
is
very
dark
i
didnt
hold
it
to
a
light
but
i
doubt
any
light
would
get
through
the
nose
is
sweet
with
chocolate
notes
the
taste
is
like
cocoa
maybe
some
chocolate
malt
im
a
bit
dissapointed
with
how
thin
it
is
i
like
a
stout
to
be
more
on
the
heavey
side
bottle
conditioning
left
a
lot
of
sediment
in
the
glass
an
aggressive
pour
in
attemp
to
generate
some
foam
made
it
hard
to
keep
the
sediment
in
the
glass
i
hope
my
love
for
stouts
isnt
making
me
give
this
brew
special
treatment
a
good
beer
to
try
but
id
look
to
purchase
so
many
other
brands
before
this
one
opened
with
a
loud
sounds
of
gases
escaping
the
bottle
poured
a
black
without
much
of
a
head
just
a
thing
ring
and
slick
of
tan
smelled
heavily
of
espresso
and
sweet
sweet
chocolate
with
mollassas
pulling
at
my
nose
taste
was
a
little
too
cloying
with
a
kinda
wet
sloppy
brown
sugar
taste
and
more
overly
sweetness
everywhere
mouthfeel
was
overly
thin
for
an
export
stout
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
but
too
watery
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
i
think
i
would
like
to
try
this
beer
again
however
not
from
the
same
selection
that
was
on
sale
in
my
local
supermarket
it
is
possible
that
i
came
across
a
bad
batch
not
bad
probably
the
best
of
the
3
coopers
sent
to
america
a
decent
export
stout
that
i
would
likely
have
again
this
was
my
first
time
with
this
beer
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
impressed
coopers
did
a
good
job
with
this
one
goes
great
with
seafood
or
with
anything
deep
or
pan
fried
its
interesting
to
compare
this
with
the
old
stout
which
is
the
same
beer
aged
in
barrels
for
a
further
6
months
i
tend
to
prefer
this
as
i
like
its
bold
in
your
face
nature
which
is
not
something
you
find
in
a
lot
of
reasonably
priced
stouts
one
of
my
favorite
aussie
beers
very
drinkable
i
could
sit
for
3
or
4
of
these
i
was
expecting
more
but
id
have
to
admit
that
this
was
drinakble
if
not
exceptional
beer
in
the
mouth
its
clean
and
slightly
watery
no
more
so
than
hundreds
of
other
commercially
successful
stouts
and
porters
but
i
was
hoping
for
authority
here
no
this
is
a
stout
with
loads
of
character
wellbalanced
integrated
its
only
missing
an
element
of
viscosity
to
make
it
perfect
drink
it
on
a
camping
trip
dark
black
color
medium
head
aroma
is
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
bananas
a
medium
bodied
stout
roasted
malts
are
balanced
by
a
very
surprising
fruitiness
a
touch
of
banana
and
vanilla
nicely
balanced
a
very
drinkable
milder
stout
nice
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
sweet
pours
very
black
with
a
quickly
dissipating
lightbrown
mediumsized
head
smells
of
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
and
alcohol
tastes
much
like
it
smells
wood
and
coffee
up
front
with
a
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
pretty
good
balance
overall
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
smooth
i
could
drink
several
but
then
again
i
am
partial
to
stouts
this
is
an
interesting
stout
because
it
had
some
characteristics
of
an
imperial
stout
but
it
was
very
thin
in
body
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
a
good
level
of
hoppiness
made
this
beer
really
balanced
the
finish
was
dry
and
roasted
this
was
a
solid
but
not
spectacular
beer
f
black
as
night
nice
fat
creamy
head
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
in
awhile
if
you
dont
really
like
hop
bitterness
this
is
your
beer
its
not
completely
void
of
hop
but
it
strikes
a
really
nice
balance
with
a
strong
lean
to
malt
super
easy
to
drink
its
got
a
pretty
strong
abv
to
boot
certianly
took
me
by
surprise
creeper
beer
pours
out
to
a
cloudy
inkblack
with
innumerable
flecks
of
brown
yeast
conglomerating
at
the
bottom
of
my
goblet
with
particles
in
a
suspended
gradient
the
tan
head
has
poor
retention
and
sits
atop
very
fine
bubbles
lacing
is
very
poor
to
nonexistent
carbonation
is
paradoxical
mild
to
moderate
by
looks
but
moderate
to
strong
by
texture
aroma
reminds
me
quite
strongly
of

at
first
flitting

the

it
out

for

with

between
being

at
the

time
and
finishing
with
a
touch

wood
and
a
hint
of
smoke
hops
are
well
balanced
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
easy
to
drink
yet
sippable
owing
to
its
complexities
alcohol
is
not
perceptable
in
aroma
or
flavor
though
there
is
a
hint
of
warmth
going
down
and
it
packs
a
decent
buzz
quite
odd
feeling
in
the
belly
the
carbonation
is
out
of
cahoots
with
the
density
of
the
brew
drawing
upon
the
best
of
the
two
beers
i
mentioned
above
but
without
their
weaknesses
this
beer
is
well
crafted
and
bests
them
both
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
i
last
drank
this
but
i
am
thoroughly
impressed

only
a

very

awesome

that
rivals

best
ink
black
appeared
clear
when
pouring
good
and
steady
head
aroma
was
the
weakest
area
quite
high
in
fruitiness
and
this
was
backed
by
a
mild
roast
malt
but
not
much
else
well
balanced
flavor
with
no
extremes
in
any
direction
eg
neither
too
sweet
or
dry
nicely
balanced
roast
flavor
with
a
prominant
fruitness
too
that
leaves
a
pleasant
lingering
as
advertised
on
the
bottle
low
astringency
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
not
necessarily
creamy
carbonation
aids
this
but
also
adds
a
filling
quality
this
is
really
quite
a
nice
stout
well
balanced
can
feel
but
not
taste
the
alcohol
id
recomment
this
except
that
the
fruitiness
may
be
high
for
some
notes
a
highly
drinkable
big
bodied
stout
a
recommended
ale
for
stout
lovers
to
have
in
their
fridge
at
all
times

versatile
beer
to

with
i
could
see

well
as

an

stout
thats
quite
enjoyable
i
havent
been
able
to
find
this
around
lately
the
review
is
from
my
notes
written
3
years
ago
this
pitchblack
stout
is
as
heavily
bodied
as
it
looks
it
is
not
overly
sweet
nor
overly
dry
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
smoky
and
quite
hoppy
with
underlying
bitter
citrus
bite
the
gorgeous
tan
head
doesnt
last
long
deep
and
complex
fragrance
rare
treat
a
bottled
fermented
stout
that
is
not
your
typical
find
and
australian
at
that
the
head
is
weak
to
nonexistent
and
the
nose
is
the
same
the
color
is
a
beautiful
and
rich
almost
a
pure
black
now
it
gets
better
the
flavor
is
complex
with
a
really
excellent
balance
of
hops
there
is
smoke
coffee
flavors
with
very
complex
malt
and
spice
followed
by
a
sharp
hop
flavor
that
leaves
no
lingering
after
taste
very
dark
almost
completely
opaque
with
a
short
and
shortlasting
but
thick
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
roast
coffee
with
hints
of
raisinprune
the
coffee
predominates
in
the
taste
as
the
combination
of
roasted
malt
and
hops
prevent
the
fruit
notes
from
making
it
very
sweet
and
also
do
a
good
job
of
concealing
the
alcohol
level
a
somewhat
thin
stout
but
perfect
for
the
outback
a
solid
stout
with
a
nice
black
appearance
a
nice
aroma
and
solid
stout
taste
this
one
was
a
bit
off
the
runofthemill
beaten
path
having
a
slightly
porteresque
tint
to
it
even
though
i
had
this
beer
following
a
20
abv
raison
dextra
i
still
found
it
hit
the
spot
rather
nicely
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
that
is
100
true
to
its
style
you
may
be
let
down
a
bit
but
if
you
like
a
little
bit
of
differentiation
or
strecthing
of
the
style
limits
you
wont
be
disappointed
an
eternal
finish
one
that
digs
in
its
claws
and
wont
let
go
a
contemplative
stout
one
to
savor
linger
over
and
enjoy
late
at
night
with
a
good
book
the
flavors
come
in
waves
and
layers
your
appreciation
of
this
dark
and
delicious
stout
grows
and
grows
first
rate
all
the
way
note
this
is
a
followup
review
so
ill
leave
my
original
review
above
although
ive
changed
the
numbers
i
bought
a
six
of
this
to
follow
up
the
single
i
had
bought
and
reviewed
before
unfortunately
upon
further
review
i
found
this
beer
to
be
sweet
and
thin
for
a
stout
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
sweet
stout
this
is
a
decent
one
but
id
prefer
youngs
or
lion
in
that
regard
pours
black
as
a
moonless
night
with
a
brown
head
that
dissipates
to
a
slight
ring
i
didnt
get
much
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
is
a
bit
sweet
with
a
burnt
roastiness
the
flavor
is
mostly
of
a
burnt
roast
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
it
has
a
somewhat
smooth
oily
texture
the
bitterness
is
at
a
good
level
subdued
by
the
roast
malt
overall
not
a
bad
stout
but
it
does
not
shout
out
drink
me
again
impenetrable
brown
with
eager
spritzy
head
that
diminished
very
strong
robust
aroma
particularly
from
the
bottle
of
molasses
and
soy
sauce
bottle
says
32601
which
i
presume
means
the
bottle
is
just
about
a
year
old
some
sediment
and
a
mellowness
indicate
its
age
im
laying
a
bottle
down
not
literally
to
see
how
long
this
bottleconditioned
brew
can
last
some
lingering
soy
or
teriyaki
sauce
in
the
flavor
could
be
a
remnant
of
improper
handling
dead
yeast
or
the
result
of
coopers
unique
maltings
for
this
beer
a
fascinating
combo
of
sweet
lactic
flavors
and
bitter
coffee
flavors
set
askew
from
normal
stout
expectations
by
a
stern
wood
quality
and
aforementioned
soy
almost
nothing
in
the
way
of
hops
although
the
beer
is
dry
enough
to
not
be
cloying
rather
fizzy
mouthfeel
for
the
style
but
thats
the
adelaide
way
a
very
interesting
drink
a
stout
that
verges
on
doppelbock
territory
should
be
a
great
thing
to
try
in
a
recipe
the
color
on
the
pours
is
as
black
as
they
come
the
head
impressive
the
lace
in
sticky
sheets
that
cling
mightily
to
the
glass
both
are
a
light
chocolate
brown
in
color
nose
is
toasted
malts
the
front
is
sweet
the
top
medium
the
finish
is
nicely
hopped
dry
light
carbonation
not
as
good
as
i
remember
it
but
still
quite
decent
stout
and
worth
the
try
pours
a
black
color
that
when
held
to
light
exhibits
a
deep
ruby
tone
a
nice
creamy
head
sits
atop
the
dark
liquid
smell
is
reminiscent
of
a
sweeter
stout
but
upon
first
taste
one
can
tell
this
is
a
stout
of
the
dry
variety
nice
coffee
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
characteristics
in
the
first
sip
finishes
rather
dry
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
watery
for
the
style
which
brings
the
drinkability
up
a
bit
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
that
packs
a
little
punch
worth
checking
out
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
minimal
taupe
head
and
quick
lacing
aroma
of
coffee
and
caramel
that
i
found
very
appealing
slightly
drybitter
flavor
that
kept
my
palate
interested
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
nice
roasted
aftereffect
i
am
a
stout
fan
and
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
one
the
nose
makes
you
think
that
it
is
a
milk
stout
but
during
the
first
taste
you
realize
that
it
is
not
it
is
bottle
fermented
and
they
may
use
a
little
too
much
sugar
in
this
process
in
fact
there
are
brown
specs
in
the
head
the
head
is
decent
at
first
but
dwindles
quickly
the
taste
is
a
little
strange
almost
oily
the
high
alcohol
content
is
not
overpowering
overall
this
beer
was
quite
disappointing
the
hops
do
not
break
through
at
all
it
almost
seems
as
though
the
brewers
do
not
have
a
direct
goal
in
mind
with
this
beer
pours
an
utter
sable
with
a
modest
dark
caramel
head
a
little
lace
a
fair
amount
of
swirling
sediment
noted
mild
carbonation
aroma
of
coffee
bitter
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
dark
roasted
malt
taste
begins
with
a
sting
of
carbonation
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
dark
roasted
malt
bitter
coffee
and
dark
fruit
all
ride
a
wave
of
sharp
tartness
to
a
crisp
and
very
dry
finish
alcohol
provides
a
warming
note
this
beer
is
nothing
less
than
excellent
and
seems
particularly
suited
to
the
winter
season
a
nice
looking
black
beer
topped
with
a
creamy
brown
head
not
a
lot
of
lacing
going
on
though
nice
blackened
malt
aroma
some
slight
burnt
tones
nice
chocolatey
taste
roasted
tones
coffee
comes
to
mind
all
of
this
is
melded
together
very
subtely
there
is
nothing
overbearing
about
this
stout
some
slight
burnt
tones
as
well
body
is
a
tad
light
checking
in
slight
above
medium
this
is
better
than
average
but
nothing
special
pour
this
aussie
stout
hard
to
get
a
twofinger
craggy
cocoa
head
that
will
coat
your
rapidly
draining
glass
brilliantly
mellow
roastiness
snuggles
with
a
hint
of
fruit
to
finish
tart
and
dry
and
long
perhaps
a
bit
too
sparkly
for
the
style
but
the
bubbles
do
a
good
job
keeping
the
roast
barley
astringency
from
overwhelming
the
buds
a
sound
swiggable
stout
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
stout
dry
and
somewhat
smoky
with
a
strong
cofee
roast
malt
flavor
and
aroma
the
beer
smells
as
though
its
going
to
be
sweet
but
there
is
almost
no
sweetness
in
the
flavor
its
probably
a
little
on
the
thin
side
for
a
stout
but
its
thicker
than
your
average
porter
dark
and
opaque
as
youd
expect
with
a
tan
lace
on
top
probably
the
best
brew
ive
sampled
from
coopers
the
uniformly
thick
dense
head
tops
a
virtually
black
hued
brew
a
hazy
deep
garnet
hue
is
visable
along
the
edges
of
the
glass
light
mocha
sharp
black
patent
aroma
along
w
a
hint
of
tart
fruity
esters
butterscotch
as
the
beer
warms
black
patent
sharpness
hits
upfront
but
gives
way
to
a
decent
balance
of
hop
bitterness
dark
crystal
malt
and
residual
unfermented
sugar
sweetness
unfortunately
the
body
is
too
thin
to
support
the
roasty
chocolately
malt
notes
this
odd
but
unique
brew
seems
to
be
a
stout
porter
hybrid
its
quite
dry
all
around
relatively
drinkable
worth
a
taste
as
a
stout
coopers
is
a
bit
lackluster
but
is
enjoyable
in
itself
impenetrably
black
with
a
small
tan
head
full

with
a
pleasing
bitter
finish
smoky

flavor
throughout
the
tasting

similar
to

finishes
somewhat
dry
with
the
strong

finishing
with

bitter

not
too
bad
the
head
dies
pretty
fast
even
when
used
in
the
right
drinking
vessel
malty
bitter
with
a
nice
aroma
a
solid
stout
but
not
a
great
one
good
highalcohol
stout
from
austrailia
for
brass
monkey
weather
as
they
say
tastes
like
a
stout
in
spite
of
not
having
any
roasted
unmalted
barley
only
black
malt
bottle
conditioned
dark
and
full
bodied
opaque
kind
of
a
scorched
coffee
flavor
starts
very
dense
but
finishes
with
a
too
bitter
edge
nicely
brewed
and
guinness
extra
stoutlike
but
the
bitterness
is
over
the
top
and
brings
the
drinkability
down
good
stout
but
can
tend
to
be
a
bitty
oily
in
textire
at
times
still
good
bitterness
but
its
not
me
fave
overall
this
is
very
good
dessert
beer
that
is
almost
overwhelmingly
bitter
if
you
like
chewing
spent
coffee
grounds
this
is
the
beer
for
you
and
i
mean
that
in
the
best
way
possible
overall
this
one
won
a
silver
star
in
2011
it
has
such
a
strong
flavour
it
is
very
hard
to
taste
the
alcohol
and
the
flavour
seems
to
develop
with
each
taste
a
good
little
number
and
very
surprising
to
me
as
i
was
not
aware
that
the
dutch
went
in
for
stout
or
that
they
were
so
accomplished
in
this
style
overall
while
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
with
a
myriad
of
complexities
its
amply
flavorful
and
an
ease
to
drink
at
5
5
abv
o
a
solid
bear
great
transition
for
the
guiness
drinker
only
knocked
for
the
diacetly
and
mediocre
head
retention
o
recommended
bart
jopenkerk
feels
that
theres
a
thick
milky
velvet
mouthfeel
to
this
stout
it
tastes
true
to
its
scent
a
light
chocolate
coffee
with
roasted
elements
disclaimer
im
partial
to
stouts
so
i
may
be
biased
but
this
beer
is
good
i
like
it
and
so
does
bart
jopenkerk
mouth
is
fuller
bod
decent
carb
light
warming
booze
o
the
lightbodied
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
very
very
easy
to
drink
but
isnt
very
flavorful
all
in
all
this
beer
could
be
improved
but
it
is
still
good
o
in
all
aspects
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
dont
consider
the
strange
taste
this
could
have
been
the
best
export
stout
ever
but
the
artificial
and
weak
taste
spoiled
that
o
i
miss
the
booze
and
body
of
a
russian
imperial
stout
but
thats
logically
concerning
the
style
for
an
ordinary
stout
it
has
good
flavor
but
you
should
not
look
specially
for
it
if
you
encounter
it
try
it
overall
nice
brew
overall
says
it
won
a
gold
medal
at
the
world
beer
championships
which
is
believable
a
solid
english
style
export
stout
definitely
more
english
than
belgian
in
style
lots
of
nice
flavor
in
this
one
and
a
decent
nose
to
boot
not
one
worth
tracking
down
per
se
but
certainly
one
worth
trying
if
you
run
across
it
a
very
solid
effort
by
an
ever
more
impressive
brewery
looking
forward
to
seeing
more
from
jopen
cheers
decent
stout
at
al
at
rooms
temperature
d
not
bad
i
just
wished
the
body
wouldve
been
more
heavy
drinking
became
better
when
the
beer
warmed
up
an
outstanding
and
mature
stout
very
dry
and
burned
the
taste
was
a
mix
of
roasted
malt
dry
bitterness
and
a
very
hoppy
layer
underneath
this
made
it
less
drying
mouthfeel
than
most
stouts
i
had
at
the
end
the
chocolate
tones
come
back
again
that
made
me
want
to
a
refill
of
yhis
one
very
drinkable
pours
a
deep
dark
black
with
a
moderate
head
that
dies
off
but
never
completely
goes
away
until
the
whole
thing
goes
away
aroma
of
espresso
which
is
one
of
the
ingredients
according
to
the
bars
advertising
and
bitter
chocolate
flavor
contains
those
elements
but
not
as
strong
as
in
the
aroma
dark
maltiness
more
sweet
than
dry
but
the
coffee
creates
some
bitterness
generally
enjoyable
thirst
quenching
good
stuff
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
leaving
some
lacing
smell
is
sweet
a
little
bit
of
cream
soft
vanilla
taste
seems
somewhat
similar
to
guinnessno
guinness
is
not
the
only
other
stout
ive
hadits
like
a
sweet
or
milk
stout
it
has
creamlike
flavors
to
it
mouthfeel
is
as
if
it
was
a
nitro
beer
and
has
a
little
less
than
medium
body
to
it
this
was
drinkable
but
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
probably
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
belgium
pours
nice
little
head
that
doesnt
retain
so
well
but
leaves
a
little
head
behind
the
color
is
black
but
does
let
light
through
but
was
not
brown
just
very
dark
the
head
retains
enough
to
leave
a
thin
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
reminds
me
of
a
lake
louie
milk
stout
for
some
reason
just
not
as
good
the
taste
is
bitter
very
very
bitter
with
some
metallic
flavors
as
well
i
can
tell
at
one
time
it
had
some
roasty
flavors
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
not
too
bad
and
kinda
smooth
overall
i
wouldnt
have
another
but
it
may
have
been
good
at
one
point
unlike
other
stouts
i
have
had
this
is
perfectly
in

and
mild
which

a
very
good
stout
with
flashes
of
brilliance
i
imagine
this
brew
would
be
good
with
food
but
would
also
be
good
as
a
sessioner
i
taste
none
of
its
slightly
higher
than
usual
abv
just
a
pleasant
stout
from
an
unusual
place
for
we
in
the
west
to
think
of
beer
but
this
beer
is
certainly
worth
a
look
a
worthy
product
of
the
ancient
city
of
harar
revised
with

d
reminds
me
of
a
light
barleywine
strange
beer
poured
into
a
black
raven
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
mahogany
amber
thin
medium
brown
head
that
dissipates
to
a
film
and
ring
around
the
glass
short
lived
lacing
nice
aroma
of
caramel
malt
with
light
roasted
malt
and
dark
dried
fruit
flavor
follows
mild
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
dried
fruit
finishes
with
pleasant
light
malt
and
molasses
a
somewhat
subdued
stout
redeemed
by
a
quite
pleasant
finish
it
leans
in
the
direction
of
a
malty
bock
but
is
close
enough
to
an
export
stout
medium
bodied
i
enjoyed
this
for
a
low
abv
light
stout
raisin
colored
brown
with
hints
of
dark
red
poured
with
a
short
beige
foam
that
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
with
a
thick
ring
around
the
glass
sweet
raisin
and
fig
aromas
with
dark
grains
in
the
background
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
syrupy
feel
brought
on
by
the
rich
carbonation
dark
fruit
flavors
from
beginning
to
end
highlighted
by
fig
and
raisins
finishes
with
a
fruity
floral
hop
bitterness
aroma
is
smoky
and
malty
typical
for
a
stout
and
appealing
i
didnt
get
a
good
look
at
the
color
but
it
appears
to
be
the
typical
opaque
sable
flavor
is
smoky
with
a
hint
of
coffee
not
as
complex
as
most
stouts
i
have
tried
but
still
enjoyable
texture
is
firmbodied
and
fizzy
leaving
a
smoky
tingle
think
no
good
beer
comes
out
of
africa
guess
again
i
bought
this
in
frederick
md
at
the
tajitu
ethiopian
restaurant
and
the
owner
told
me
that
heineken
is
allegedly
trying
to
buy
either
this
beer
or
the
brewery
interesting
if
it
happens
personally
i
prefer
the
harar
lager
over
this
beer
but
both
are
good
candidates
for
a
much
wider
beer
audience
i
had
this
in
an
ethiopian
restaurant
in
sacramento
not
sure
if
it
was
my
hunger
or
failing
taste
buds
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
beer
malty
and
not
bitter
it
has
the
characteristic
chocolate
and
coffee
smell
and
taste
if
diluted
a
bit
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
but
id
get
this
again
overall
definitely
a
pretty
good
beer
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
certainly
not
the
worst
its
really
nice
for
the
climate
in
ethiopia
it
gives
the
taste
of
a
stout
without
the
heaviness
on
draft
is
much
better
than
in
the
bottle
ill
be
looking
into
getting
a
tap
in
my
house
or
opening
up
a
restaurant
where
this
is
served
on
tap
and
where
i
can
be
all
the
time
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
definitely
be
coming
often
to
grab
a
draft
o
i
think
this
tastes
very
good
also
though
ive
not
been
to
ethiopia
i
picture
it
even
hotter
than
florida
this
is
just
about
as
stout
as
a
brew
need
be
for
unfortunately
hot
locales
the
mouthfeel
is
highlycarbonated
and
thin
a
thicker
mouthfeel
would
make
this
brew
much
more
enjoyable
the
drinkability
is
alright
the
metallic
end
starts
to
get
a
bit
grating
after
a
while
though
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
and
a
nice
opportunity
to
try
something
different
quite
thin
mouthfeel
is
definitely
the
worst
aspect
of
this
beer
weak
carbonation
definitely
on
the
boat
too
long
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
filmy
not
horrible
perhaps
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
not
very
drinkable
im
very
tempted
to
drainpour
strange
i
better
have
another
one
just
to
make
sure
overallnot
as
successful
as
their
other
beer
a
muddled
weak
stout
not
recommended
african
beer
2
following
the
very
disappointing
tusker
crossing
the
border
into
ethiopia
better
fingers
are
crossed
this
guy
pours
a
weak
dark
burnt
brown
with
some
translucence
and
a
minor
bit
of
offwhite
foamy
head
looks
less
like
a
stout
more
like
a
slightly
darker
brown
ale
not
a
good
start
the
nose
is
cocoa
rye
bread
crust
yeast
dark
wheat
and
some
faint
unidentified
dark
fruit
someone
didnt
use
the
bullion
cube
properly
in
this
soup
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
stepup
with
notes
of
cocoa
very
light
coffee
a
pinch
o
brown
sugar
and
a
bready
undercurrent
not
bad
but
nowhere
near
great
or
even
very
good
the
body
is
medium
on
the
lighter
end
of
that
minispectrum
with
a
surprisingly
high
level
of
carbonation
the
whole
thing
is
exceedingly
thin
and
far
too
watery
i
just
cant
see
myself
drinking
too
much
of
this
frankly
looks
like
the
horns
issues
now
include
brewing
though
maybe
the
political
social
and
economic
issues
are
still
worse
tough
to
tell
taste
is
a
little
watery
sour
malt
and
some
caramel
ends
a
little
tart
and
a
little
bitter
i
had
never
had
an
ethiopian
beer
or
a
foreign
export
stout
but
this
totally
isnt
a
stout
overall
the
beer
was
drinkable
and
overall
unoffensive
everything
was
subdued
there
was
a
roast
flavor
but
its
was
an
afterthought
appearance
is
a
lighter
than
expected
very
dark
amber
with
minimal
head
that
dissapates
quickly
having
no
lace
smell
of
sweet
dark
fruits
and
chocolate
taste
of
lightly
sweet
dark
fruits
with
the
chocolate
having
light
hops
and
a
metallic
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
stout
but
goes
down
smooth
with
good
carbonation
id
have
to
say
that
this
is
my
first
african
stout
drinkability
interesting
beer
not
much
of
a
stout
but
overall
not
that
bad
as
far
as
a
beer
but
that
being
said
i
probally
wouldnt
get
this
again
first
beer
of
the
night
at
addis
red
sea
ethiopian
restaurant
in
the
south
end
poured
into
a
glass
and
formed
a
small
head
very
light
in
color
mostly
brownish
red
not
much
smell
maybe
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
taste
was
just
above
average
some
roasted
malt
but
not
much
very
thin
for
a
stout
but
i
think
it
probably
suits
the
environment
in
which
its
brewed
not
heavy
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
this
was
more
of
a
dark
ale
than
anything
else
i
was
given
a
chance
to
try
a
stout
from
africa
and
it
didnt
let
me
down
too
much
picked
some
up
in
little
ethiopia
in
los
angeles
i
spotted
all
kinds
of
ethiopian
beers
and
picked
up
this
one
from
harrar
and
a
lager
to
try
this
is
more
of
a
brown
ale
in
my
opinion
pours
with
a
very
small
head
that
dissipates
immediately
color
was
dark
brown
no
murkiness
tastes
very
coffee
like
with
a
strong
malt
flavor
high
carbonation
with
a
pleasant
yeasty
aftertaste
its
a
very
tasty
beer
and
i
will
buy
some
more
if
im
ever
down
there
again
d
an
interesting
beer
id
probably
order
it
again
in
an
ethiopian
restaurant
the
bottle
says
hakim
stout
dark
beer
as
a
dark
beer
like
a
sweet
brown
ale
its
merely
bad
as
a
stout
its
quite
possibly
the
worst
example
of
a
stout
ive
ever
had
not
as
rich
and
flavorful
as
some
other
stouts
especially
an
ris
however
if
it
were
scorching
hot
out
this
probably
be
quite
refeshing
and
smooth
lighter
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
i
wanted
to
like
it
but
honestly
i
cant
manage
another
one
probably
ever
the
taste
is
stronger
and
more
complex
mostly
sweet
and
malty
with
a
faint
sour
quality
a
little
caramel
stewed
fruit
musky
wine
a
hint
of
chocolate
pours
a
slightly
murky
cheestnut
which
is
quite
light
for
the
style
with
a
head
that
dissipates
in
about
two
seconds
no
lacing
aromas
of
caramel
light
maltiness
and
minerally
as
well
tastes
like
a
sweet
stout
mixed
12
and
12
with
club
soda
the
flavors
arent
bad
but
the
beer
is
light
and
fizzy
probably
the
lightest
stout
of
any
kind
that
ive
had
sweet
caramel
a
slightly
treacly
character
and
mineral
water
round
out
the
flavors
mouthfeel
is
too
light
and
spritzy
this
beer
is
just
okay
too
light
spritzy
and
sweet
never
had
an
ethiopian
beer
and
since
it
wasnt
a
fizzy
euro
lager
i
thought
id
give
it
a
try
unfortunately
its
a
fizzy
stout
instead
had
this
at
an
ethiopian
restaurant
in
sf
small
bottle
poured
into
a
water
glass
dark
brown
no
head
no
lacing
not
too
dark
either
smelled
of
roasty
malts
more
along
the
lines
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
tasty
not
much
if
any
alcohol
present
decent
mouthfeel
not
too
remarkable
in
any
way
some
caramel
some
raosty
malts
but
not
overly
sweet
all
in
all
it
was
very
drinkable
complemented
the
meal
well
and
i
had
another
d
a
curious
beer
seems
to
defy
categorization
in
the
babjcp
sense
am
i
glad
to
have
tried
this
yes
have
it
again
probably
not
a
treat
to
sample
this
brew
its
one
id
recommend
any
fan
of
the
unusual
beer
to
try
good
luck
finding
it
though
a
little
thin
of
body
but
very
drinkable
i
guess
it
is
hot
in
ethiopia
and
this
would
be
a
tasty
beer
for
the
climate
while
a
different
style
it
has
a
similar
depth
as
a
negro
modelo
dark
but
drinkable
on
a
sunny
day
tastewise
things
fell
apart
a
bit
some
good
stouty
elements
such
as
molasses
roasted
malt
and
black
licorice
but
they
didnt
blend
well
together
and
the
whole
thing
lacked
structure
a
slight
metallic
twang
also
detracted
from
things
the
body
needs
the
most
work
of
all
way
too
thin
for
a
stout
sweet
honey
and
chocolate
in
the
taste
as
well
with
some
roasted
malt
bitterness
fairly
sweet
but
not
cloying
and
very
pleasantly
drinkable
fairly
light
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
but
its
a
pretty
good
beer
that
id
love
to
try
again
mouth
didnt
quite
live
up
to
my
expectations
a
bit
plastic
tasting
and
sour
but
not
in
a
horrible
way
the
chocolate
is
extremely
strong
and
delicious
with
a
very
unique
after
taste
like
burnt
chocolate
the
flavor
is
a
bit
too
sour
and
has
some
processed
candy
like
qualities
that
arent
too
favorable
my
girlfriend
screamed
thats
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
but
i
disagree
its
not
great
tasting
but
has
some
interesting
flavors
that
i
liked
thorough
carbonation
as
well
probably
not
a
beer
i
will
have
again
if
this
were
put
in
front
of
me
blind
and
someone
told
me
it
was
a
bock
id
think
it
was
an
average
effort
for
a
brewpub
or
homebrew
bock
as
a
stout
it
fails
on
so
many
levels
as
a
r
i
s
its
not
even
close
its
drinkable
definitely
good
as
an
after
dinner
dessert
alternative
i
was
having
ethiopian
food
which
i
assume
the
hakim
was
made
to
accompany
it
does
a
decent
job
of
it
overall
though
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
this
beer
is
not
something
i
would
recommend
to
someone
new
to
the
craft
beer
scene
worth
trying
once
but
not
something
i
would
have
another
go
at
im
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
sample
this
stout
from
ethiopia
im
not
pining
away
for
my
lost
cash
that
went
towards
the
purchase
of
it
but
i
can
confidently
say
i
cant
see
myself
buying
another
one
of
these
especially
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
translucent
dark
brown
small
quickly
dissipating
head
smell
is
suitably
roasted
malts
some
toffee
the
flavors
are
not
nearly
as
forceful
the
malts
are
very
subdued
still
present
but
not
strong
enough
to
have
a
lasting
impact
the
body
is
lighter
than
a
feather
for
this
style
carbonation
approaches
soda
levels
its
drinkable
an
interesting
sample
from
ethiopia
thanks
to

this

with
a
large

this

works

in

stouts
think
samuel
smiths

xxx
as
this
beer
warms
up
the
lactose
taste
goes
away
its
a
shame
how
much
this
beers
rating
has
suffered
from
it
being
misscategorized
as
an
ris
this
is
a
below
average
robust
stout
but
its
a
nice
brown
porter
picked
this
up
at
an
ethiopian
market
i
was
hesitant
because
the
owner
reccomended
some
beers
and
this
was
not
one
of
his
suggestions
i
picked
it
up
anyway
for
the
sake
of
my
fellow
beer
advocates
the
low
alcohol
content
had
me
wary
with
this
long
journey
to
the
west
coast
had
a
nice
carbonation
phssst
when
i
popped
the
cap
and
it
poured
nicely
into
a
gobblet
forming
a
solid
one
finger
head
the
froth
was
odd
for
an
imperial
in
that
it
was
off
white
at
best
and
fell
to
an
island
with
no
lacing
lots
of
dark
fruity
smell
and
huge
chocolate
presence
that
dominated
throughout
im
ranking
this
as
an
imperial
but
it
seems
more
suited
for
a
stout
category
this
has
to
have
the
worst
mouthfeel
of
any
imperial
ive
had
watered
down
nothing
creamy
oily
or
anything
other
than
a
watered
down
chocolate
and
some
burnt
flavors
but
no
zing
if
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
light
stout
this
would
be
it
nothing
offensive
just
doesnt
produce
the
imperial
status
despite
not
being
a
proper
stout
it
does
go
down
pretty
easy
they
say
that
euthopia
brews
beer
some
colour
and
head
and

i
think
run
in
by
oakes
drinkability

not
bad
but
wont
buy
again
it
is
very
interesting
though
that
it
comes
from
ethiopia
i
would
have
predicted
much
worse
it
runs
a
little
smokey
and
pleasantly
bittersweet
a
little
fruity
a
bit
of
grass
comes
through
this
is
thin
but
very
drinkable
exceedingly
delicious
with
ethiopian
foods
doesnt
overpower
any
of
the
delicately
spiced
legumes
but
stands
up
to
the
chiles
and
the
wonderful
collard
greens
yeah
its
kinda
thin
and
not
very
complicated
but
it
sure
goes
down
easily
its
totally
enjoyable
with
the
meal
seems
a
little
light
in
colour
for
an
imperial
stout
poured
more
brownishorange
than
dark
small
foam
head
on
top
whisps
of

on
the
glass
smelled
very
sweet
not
cloyingly
sweet
legitimate
sweet
malts
dark
fruits
like
raisins
and
plums
coffee
and
chocolate
beans
heavy
coffee
taste
and
raisin
taste
sort
of
bittersweet
the
malt
and
raisins
add
a
sweet
taste
while
the
coffee
makes
it
bitter
pretty
good
actually
flows
down
the
throat
nice
and
smoothly
an
above
par
beer
and
a
good
imperial
stout
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
roasted
coffee
and
raisin
aroma
full
bodied
coffee
taste
with
raisins
and
spicy
flavors
that
lingered
on
the
tongue
the
flavors
are
assertive
but
not
too
heavy
on
the
palate
a
very
pleasant
roasted
aftertaste
smooth
and
complex
it
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
bit
of
rubiness
at
the
edges
when
held
to
the
right
big
tan
head
which
was
gone
in
about
2
minutes
smell
was
of
a
mild
roasty
maltiness
with
caramel
and
a
floral
hoppiness
the
taste
is
predominantly
caramel
with
a
slight
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
stout
this
is
very
drinkable
a
better
session
beer
than
most
beers
labeled
stout
the
first
thing
you
think
is
ethiopian
beer
yeah
right
but
then
you
try
it
first
off
this
beer
has
more
in
common
with
a
belgian
brown
or
a
double
bock
than
a
stout
but
i
assume
the
word
stout
has
come
to
encompass
all
darker
than
average
beers
in
the
former
colonies
this
is
quite
simply
an
exceptional
beer
it
has
an
excellent
mouthfeel
and
whatever
kind
of
exotic
spices
are
put
into
this
are
very
noticable
but
not
in
an
overbearing
way
has
notes
of
roasted
coffee
and
plums
the
bottle
with
the
funky
label
is
also
a
plus
for
the
collectors
in
the
house
this
beer
was
not
all
that
bad
but
it
suffered
in
the
s
because
it
did
not
fit
the
style
it
claimed
to
be
also
i
think
to
truely
enjoy
this
one
you
must
be
somewhere
deep
in
east
africa
have
a
dusty
throat
and
be
sitting
in
the
shade
i
feel
it
would
taste
perfect
then
dark
brown
in
color
with
no
real
head
to
speak
of
aroma
of
raisins
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
hint
at
the
alcohol
and
malt
strenght
of
the
beer
was
mediumlight
bodied
and
slightly
bitter
on
the
sides
of
the
tongue
relatively
light
flavored
with
raisins
and
plums
most
dominant
in
the
mouth
milky
coffee
came
through
as
it
warmed
very
interesting
especially
when
you
consider
it
came
from
ethiopia
o
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
not
a
lot
of
character
a
tad
too
sweet
but
not
bad
the
feel
goes
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
its
not
quite
as
robust
as
the
label
boasts
its
got
a
sizeable
body
for
sure
but
still
sits
in
the
medium
range
alcohol
sneaks
in
somewhere
and
goes
into
a
finish
that
draws
out
some
powdery
dryness
mixed
bag
in
the
nose
and
tastes
malts
first
and
foremost
mild
liquorice
front
with
sweeter
molassses
taking
over
a
mini
hop
dry
finish
completes
the
flavours
but
there
is
a
lot
more
going
on
inbetween
my
bottle
had
a
nice
but
unexpected
and
unusual
semisour
feel
for
a
stout
to
it
throughout
the
tasting
i
also
thought
the
alcohol
level
isnt
hidden
to
any
great
extent
complexed
and
different
with
a
variety
of
fruit
notes
and
malty
levels
of
roastedtoasted
chocolate
and
coffee
poured
into
a
maudite
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
in
the
glass
massive
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
lots
of
pillowing
lacing
aroma
of
dark
toasted
malt
dark
dried
fruit
slightly
vinous
and
sour
flavor
starts
with
dark
toasted
malt
and
develops
a
nice
fruit
flavor
of
plums
and
raisins
finishing
slightly
dry
with
dark
fruit
light
chocolate
and
a
bright
spicy
flavor
that
may
be
from
the
oyster
shells
slight
hops
medium
bodied
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
a
very
nice
flavor
progression
and
complexity
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
i
lean
towards
imperial
stouts
but
this
was
great
i
will
return
to
this
stout
i
am
not
a
big
stout
fan
as
i
dont
drink
coffee
and
love
my
beer
refreshing
but
this
one
is
my
favorite
in
this
style
so
far
dont
know
if
i
got
a
bad
one
or
what
poured
this
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
gigantic
light
tan
foamy
billowy
thick
head
that
slowly
settles
and
very
little
lace
color
is
an
odd
clear
pink
brown
with
lots
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
super
mild
and
whats
there
is
malty
roasty
fruity
flavors
like
nose
but
up
front
is
very
metallic
mineral
and
medicine
its
also
dry
light
soft
carbonation
and
ditto
carbonic
tang
finish
is
bitter
and
astringent
also
with
time
the
metallic
part
diminishes
dont
know
if
ill
finish
it
o
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
id
readily
return
to
again
o
good
drinking
beer
with
a
nice
bitter
aftertaste
o
pretty
nice
complex
overall
this
beer
was
just
too
old
and
i
take
full
responsibility
nice
darkbrown
fluid
with
one
finger
head
this
is
one
easy
drinkable
beer
there
is
absolutely
no
bitterness
in
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
o
a
good
beer
very
tasty
worth
buying
again
as
i
already
did
o
the
beer
has
some
complexities
in
its
flavors
yet
is
extremely
drinkable
its
somewhat
sweet
but
not
cloying
because
this
is
balanced
off
by
a
light
amount
of
bitterness
dr
not
excellent
but
will
serve
as
a
great
example
of
a
well
done
bitter
stout
well
priced
at
least
in
belgium
overall
balanced
and
complex
but
nothing
toooutof
the
ordinary
maybe
a
oyster
stout
in
a
small
serving
would
be
really
interesting
in
a
food
pairing
but
this
was
good
enough
for
the
bottle
i
think
the
schelde
brouwerij
makes
very
nice
easy
to
drink
beers
also
try
the
zeezuiper
overall
a
nice
stout
but
as
often
there
are
so
many
more
interesting
ones
around
still
if
you
like
the
style
worth
to
try
you
will
not
regret
so
this
beer
is
supposed
to
be
filtered
through
oyster
shells
its
color
nearly
obsidian
with
only
some
deep
brown
hues
if
held
to
strong
light
the
head
is
a
fairly
dark
tan
nice
aroma
with
some
chocolate
overtones
theres
a
little
roast
barley
in
the
smell
but
the
chocolate
really
stands
out
pretty
good
balance
in
the
taste
the
beer
is
a
little
on
the
dry
side
with
a
good
chocolate
malt
character
and
a
firm
bitterness
honestly
im
not
sure
that
they
oyster
shells
do
anything
just
a
gimmick
i
suppose
the
mouthfeel
is
sufficiently
creamy
and
full
this
is
an
fine
beer
pours
a
very
dark
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
foamy
tan
yelowish
head
the
aroma
consists
of
dark
roasted
chocolate
maltiness
and
salt
seafood
smooth
roasted
malty
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
toffee
oatmeal
coffee
and
seafoodoysters
the
fish
taste
is
not
toooverpowering
however
very
unique
overall
nothing
special
here
though
the
palate
is
nice
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
the
nose
and
taste
is
just
not
interesting
enough
to
say
anything
its
drinkable
if
only
because
its
generic
enough
and
doesnt
do
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
i
dont
see
it
being
an
oyster
stout
either
compared
to
others
ive
had
at
least
not
one
ill
revisit
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
burgundy
color
ale
with
a
giant
size
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
with
some
sweet
malt
notes
and
a
breadlike
yeast
is
quite
interesting
taste
is
a
complex
mix
between
some
liquorice
roasted
malt
and
belgian
semisweet
malt
with
notes
of
dry
hops
also
noticeable
and
the
influence
of
a
belgian
style
yeast
strain
cannot
be
denied
very
interesting
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
regular
access
to
described
by
the
brewery
as
filtered
through
oystershells
which
is
a
little
weird
i
always
appreciate
weird
i
was
mildly
surprised
to
see
a
stout
on
draft
in
the
netherlands
but
the
bar
came
highly
recommended
it
would
have
been
a
perfect
experience
with
oysters
though
there
were
none
on
the
menu
nonetheless
a
very
tasty
stout
with
nice
dry
tones
and
not
much
residual
sugar
this
actually
has
become
my
home
beer
one
of
a
few
i
always
make
sure
to
have
in
my
cellar
the
others
are
for
example
girardin
unfiltered
rochefort
10
and
karmeliet
so
you
can
imagine
this
must
have
the
same
quality
and
it
does
appearance
and
aroma
are
as
to
be
expected
notes
of
chocolate
in
the
aroma
good
looking
but
the
flavor
is
wonderful
not
exceptional
just
wonderful
chocolate
coffee
light
roasted
sweet
and
a
bit
salty
a
beer
i
can
drink
all
evening
i
dont
know
where
the
oysters
come
into
play
i
was
rather
looking
forward
to
an
oyster
stout
no
such
luck
here
enjoyable
to
drink
hides
the
alcohol
well
suprisingly
little
smell
some
dry
roastyness
and
chocolate
smell
maybe
taste
is
unique
chocolate
caramel
something
unique
in
the
aftertaste
is
that
oyster
there
seems
to
be
a
salty
slimy
coating
in
the
mouthfeel
could
be
oyster
i
guess
i
wish
i
could
read
my
notes
for
the
drinkability
but
apparantly
i
was
a
bit
too
drunk
to
write
neatly
i
did
write
3
5
though
although
this
was
a
good
beer
it
was
not
a
typical
stout
more
a
crossover
between
a
dubbel
and
a
stout
i
liked
it
md
its
mediumfull
bodied
but
tastes
simply
too
light
for
the
flavour
with
lots
of
fizz
on
the
palate
in
every
sip
i
cant
say
what
style
this
beer
means
to
beits
quite
mixed
and
has
a
bit
of
baltic
porter
belgian
dark
ale
dark
bock
but
a
stoutoyster
stout
it
is
not
with
due
respect
with
its
slightly
cloying
profile
i
dont
even
think
it
goes
with
oysters
as
probably
meant
to
be
according
to
its
inappropriate
name
not
a
bad
beer
in
its
own
right
though
but
to
review
it
within
style
plus
its
overall
price
performance
cost
me
2
7
pounds
for
such
a
small
bottle
i
wouldnt
buy
it

dark

with
kind
of

great

notes
not

ill
be
drinking
this
again
straightforward
stout
with
a
little
bit
behind
it
making
it
a
tad
sweeter
than
a
normal
irish
dry
stout
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
in
the
taste
but
might
add
to
a
lighter
feel
definitely
would
grab
again
on
tap
as
an
occasional
beer
might
be
cautious
against
a
six
pack
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
dry
finish
excellent
brew
extra
dry
good
drinking
beer
but
generally
disappointing
compared
to
other
beers
from
the
brewery
o
a
fairly
rich
stout
sweetnesswise
with
some
interesting
characteristics
though
not
particularly
my
style
for
fans
of
the
style
or
brewer
dont
take
a
pass
for
the
rest
probably
a
hitormiss
depending
on
your
personal
tastes
this
is
a
dark
almost
black
beer
the
head
is
tan
and
dense
but
not
exceptionally
long
lived
the
beers
aroma
is
of
sweet
malt
a
little
grain
and
it
has
a
rich
heavily
roasted
character
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
sweetness
and
grain
full
thick
body
excellent
brew
pours
a
dark
blackbody
with
a
thick
rich
craggy
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
properties
roasty
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
cold
coffee
and
a
bit
of
toffee
flavor
is
sweet
and
cocoalike
with
hints
of
toffee
right
up
front
before
mocha
flavors
with
their
espresso
bitterness
round
out
the
midpalate
there
is
a
slight
but
pleasant
alcoholic
warmth
on
the
finish
that
reminds
you
that
this
a
sipper
not
a
gulper
medium
full
body
is
appropriate
to
the
austerity
of
its
flavors
and
abv
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
looks
and
smells
like
a
typical
irish
stout
but
tasting
reveals
a
slightly
high
and
a
bit
too
lively
carbonation
level
and
more
generous
use
of
hops
the
nose
is
more
spicy
than
usual
too
relatively
complex
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
molasses
and
dried
fruit
near
even
sweetbitter
balance
head
has
weak
retention
overall
a
flavourful
brew
that
is
still
very
drinkable
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavours
are
all
in
balance
well
worth
picking
up
a
bottle
to
try
overall
not
your
typical
irish
stout
but
ill
take
it
drinks
easier
than
its
8
abv
o
a
nice
stout
give
me
some
more
roast
and
this
one
would
kick
ass
still
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
borderline
refreshing
in
the
way
a
foreign
stout
should
be
i
like
this
will
certainly
purchase
again
as
a
standard
extra
stout
i
prefer
this
on
tap
good
roast
character
and
the
sweetness
is
a
nice
counter
but
that
metallic
note
is
a
bit
much
pours
with
the
look
of
a
great
irish
stout
then
the
head
died
quickly
and
i
realized
the
aroma
was
somewhat
tame
compared
to
classic
irish
stouts
i
have
tasted
over
the
years
upon
first
sip
the
flavor
was
nice
not
bitter
and
yet
flavored
with
bakers
chocolate
and
light
roast
not
the
usual
heavy
mouth
feel
or
after
taste
of
guiness
or
other
stouts
i
will
say
it
does
drink
smoothly
for
8
abv
stout
overall
its
somewhat
generic
ill
forget
what
it
tastes
like
in
a
few
weeks
or
months
but
does
no
harm
to
the
style
this
is
a
solid
entry
into
the
style
that
wont
necessarily
blow
you
away
but
is
perfectly
enjoyable
o
an
excellent
dry
stout
worth
checking
out
if
you
like
stouts
for
sure
a
stronger
and
tastier
guinness
bottle
poured
a
deep
black
color
stout
with
a
nice
light
brown
creamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
deep
chocolate
notes
with
light
roasted
malt
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
heavier
than
i
had
anticipated
with
loads
of
black
chocolate
notes
with
some
roasted
malt
notes
and
some
light
dry
bitter
notes
body
is
fuller
then
expected
with
good
carbonation
very
enjoyable
and
probably
closer
to
a
foreign
stout
than
an
irish
stout
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
one
that
schlafly
has
done
well
and
i
can
appreciate
it
oa
solid
well
crafted
stout
not
out
of
this
world
but
another
nice
beer
from
schlafly
do
the
decision
to
engage
in
a
beerdrinking
experience
may
be
compared
to
an
investment
the
level
of
risk
alcohol
content
should
correlate
positively
to
the
size
of
the
payoff
beers
like
this
stout
break
such
a
rule
by
being
needlessly
strong
for
the
rather
ordinary
sensory
qualities
they
deliver
theres
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
it
save
perhaps
for
the
lack
of
dryness
expected
from
members
of
the
style
but
it
would
be
just
as
extra
at

a
sixpack
oi
pretty
nice
beer
not
my
favorite
but
im
not
so
much
into
this
style
really
glad
i
tried
a
six
pack
very
unique
definitely
has
the
schlafly
taste
mouthfeel
thick
and
heavy
like
a
stout
should
be
but
it
is
easy
drinking
for
a
stout
making
for
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
o
overall
good
but
not
great
from
top
to
bottom
i
wont
seek
this
out
but
id
gladly
drink
it
if
given
to
me
paired
well
with
a
large
sunday
brunch
of
pancakes
bacon
and
eggs
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
black
color
produced
a
thick
tan
head
and
featured
outstanding
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
roasted
malt
and
smoke
full
bodied
this
ale
featured
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
some
hop
bitterness
high
in
alochol
somewhat
dry
and
warming
on
the
way
down
overall
its
an
average
example
of
the
style
about
as
good
as
ive
had
from
a
amercian
microbrewery
prost
o
a
generous
beer
bold
very
complex
and
with
a
good
drinkability
quite
far
from
the
style
but
i
love
it
overall
im
a
little
torn
on
this
stout
yes
it
is
roasty
and
a
little
dry
however
booze
is
too
noticeable
and
it
is
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
not
to
mention
it
is
not
the
most
complex
dry
stout
out
there
i
guess
complexity
isnt
a
prerequisite
for
the
style
but
something
else
could
have
reared
its
tasty
head
to
help
this
beer
out
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
i
wont
go
out
of
the
way
for
this
overall
pretty
good
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
overall
i
payed
2
for
a
single
if
this
and
i
honestly
hope
there
are
more
when
i
go
back
because
i
only
have
one
left
and
i
would
like
to
have
more
than
that
if
possible
i
like
this
stout
quite
a
bit
going
to
call
it
my
st
patricks
day
brew
this
year
and
hopefully
from
here
on
out
taste
was
a
pleasant
surprise
some
bitterness
with
coffee
and
roastiness
a
really
nice
balanced
beer
easy
to
drink
too
easy
it
is
pretty
strong
and
will
catch
up
with
you
this
is
not
an
overly
dry
stout
which
was
a
concern
of
mine
when
i
saw
irish
i
will
seek
this
out
again
not
sure
if
it
is
available
all
the
time
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
either
schlafly
makes
some
good
beer
and
this
one
is
not
on
my
top
schlafly
list
thanks
sam
overall
not
bad
not
overly
complex
but
easy
drinking
for
8
abv
i
would
buy
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
pretty
good
extra
stout
very
tasty
irish
stout
o
very
enjoyable
but
a
bold
flavored
beer
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
enjoyed
by
various
types
of
beer
drinkers
at
the
super
bowl
party
this
past
weekend
from
casual
noncraft
beer
folks
to
serious
craft
beer
drinkers
o
the
beer
is
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
from
the
taste
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
taste
is
rich
and
thick
but
smoothbodied
i
get
coffee
and
chocolate
roastiness
theres
little
hint
of

just
a
smooth
and
wellbalanced
extra
stout
thats
every
bit
as
tasty
as
any
out
there
superb
overall
its
not
bad
solid
but
not
really
grabbing
me
like
most
schlafly
beers
i
certainly
like
the
guinness
foreign
export
much
more
overall
i
generally
detest
the
word
extra
in
a
beer
name
this
is
a
decent
irish
dry
stout
but
i
dont
feel
that
it
needs
the
8
0
abv
its
got
a
good
dry
stout
feel
and
the
taste
is
fair
but
schlafly
always
seem
to
do
at
least
one
thing
i
dont
like
in
each
of
their
beers
theres
way
too
much
alcohol
in
this
one
pours
near
black
with
a
good
light
mocha
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
the
nose
carries
quite
a
bit
of
roast
plus
some
coffee
very
mild
chocolate
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
roast
and
coffee
quite
roasty
and
a
touch
acrid
lightmedium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
faint
dryness
to
the
finish
mild
bitterness
as
well
pretty
good
drinkability
after
a
couple
more
of
these
i
will
be
lucky
to
be
functional
by
noon
tomorrow
this
is
a
double
whammy
of
dark
malts
and
booze
next
stop
hangover
city
o
a
great
beer
the
flavors
scents
blend
well
schlafly
did
it
very
well
this
beer
is
full
bodied
and
drinks
exceptionally
smooth
this
time
around
i
think
its
a
bit
more
sweet
than
the
roasty
flavor
this
style
should
have
however
im
enjoying
it
much
better
this
second
time
around
m
extra
thick
and
chewy
lots
of
bubbly
carbonation
which
was
almost
a
little
coarse
for
me
and
my
expectation
of
irish
stouts
finish
is
fairly
smooth
with
lingering
sticky
sweetness
o
goes
down
easy
a
very
tasty
beer
good
example
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
good
everyday
irish
stout
could
have
been
more
creamy
and
had
a
bigger
taste
profile
but
its
a
solid
b
not
going
to
add
it
to
my
beer
fridge
but
it
beats
guinness
all
to
hell
o
im
slowly
beginning
to
appreciate
stouts
and
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
very
smooth
and
drinker
friendly
i
would
not
hesitate
to
enjoy
this
beer
again
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
very
black
indeed
the
beer
poured
a
nice
head
that
was
kind
of
a
chocolate
color
and
nice
and
poofy
the
taste
was
kind
of
like
burnt
chocolate
not
terrible
nut
really
strong
i
think
i
would
try
this
beer
again
o
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
one
im
not
used
to
a
dry
irish
stout
being
this
robustor
smooth
i
have
had
this
in
my
cellar
for
about
7
months
just
a
really
good
irish
stout
no
bells
or
whistles
for
a
fes
this
was
a
decent
take
on
it
sure
its
strong
and
im
feeling
it
as
i
finish
it
up
but
its
nothing
excessive
and
the
booze
never
overtook
the
flavors
and
ambiance
of
this
beer
im
not
sure
if
id
give
it
another
go
but
for
anyone
who
loves
dark
beers
and
doesnt
want
to
be
bowled
over
while
having
one
this
would
be
a
good
choice
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
sweet
up
front
with
a
thin
and
mildly
bitter
finish
the
midpalate
has
this
great
milk
chocolate
flavor
that
is
very
interesting
i
really
enjoyed
this
little
stout
sweeter
than
i
expected
but
i
guess
thats
what
makes
it
a
fes
id
have
it
again
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
more
of
these
the
only
negative
for
me
was
the
muted
aromas
but
the
taste
more
than
made
up
for
that
this
stout
is
motor
oil
black
with
some
tan
lacing
aroma
is
malt
with
chocolate
coffee
and
licorice
tastes
just
like
it
smells
unsweetened
chocolate
licorice
coffee
malty
sweetness
up
front
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
lightly
carbonated
long
finish
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
just
slightly
unbalanced
but
still
delicious
paired
well
with
some
dark
chocolate
brewed
with
love
on
02042011
d
a
very
nice
brew
here
folks
above
average
in
all
categories
and
teetering
on
outstanding
in
most
i
only
get
to
sample
schlafly
on
a
limited
basis
but
this
is
my
favorite
to
date
not
overpowering
and
proof
the
depth
and
complexity
go
along
way
in
making
a
world
class
offering
overall
smoothest
stout
i
might
have
ever
had
from
an
american
brewery
have
seen
this
out
in
the
stores
as
a
special
release
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
was
on
a
nitrotap
at
the
taproom
i
went
straight
for
it
great
drinkability
as
well
definitely
worth
a
try
d
pretty
good
drinkability
for
the
abv
i
didnt
look
closely
enough
at
the
bottle
so
i
was
expecting
something
more
along
the
lines
of
45
nice
beer
and
totally
suitable
for
this
time
of
the
year
a
bit
overly
carbonated
to
start
but
that
eventually
with
a
few
swirls
and
time
goes
away
left
are
bitter
hop
notes
and
a
dry
finish
just
what
this
style
should
be
and
done
pretty
darn
well
d
at
8
i
couldnt
detect
a
damn
bit
of
alcohol
the
word
of
mouth
about
this
brew
has
been
excellent
so
i
picked
up
a
sixer
i
have
a
few
more
left
and
may
have
to
grab
even
more
to
last
me
through
st
paddys
day
drinkability
off
the
charts
this
is
the
stout
that
you
can
knock
back
a
few
even
at
8
and
still
get
the
rich
full
complex
taste
that
lots
of
impy
stout
bring
at
well
over
10
drinkability
nice
brew
diffidently
want
to
try
this
one
again
on
the
higher
end
of
medium
bodied
this
is
actually
a
fairly
quaffable
beer
might
not
be
the
best
beer
ever
but
for
9
99
a
six
pack
this
is
an
affordable
quality
beer
d
a
very
solid
irish
stout
a
perfect
daily
drinker
drinkability
i
thought
this
one
was
good
and
would
be
willing
to
drink
it
again
overall
an
exceptional
stout
never
tried
a
foreignexport
stout
before
but
i
would
love
to
try
more
to
compare
against
flavors
and
aromas
were
extraordinary
and
the
balance
was
perfect
probably
the
best
brew
ive
tried
yet
from
schlafly
this
is
my
favorite
schlafly
that
i
can
remember
having
very
good
overall
a
good
tasting
beer
but
it
has
a
few
noticable
flaws
within
the
style
its
pretty
drinkable
but
not
something
id
want
to
drink
every
day
full
in
body
a
little
dry
and
warming
in
the
end
very
crisp
smooth
mouthfeel
it
was
a
good
a
little
hot
i
have
to
say
i
appreciate
the
regular
irish
stouts
a
little
more
than
the
exports
this
offering
from
schlafly
suffers
from
the
same
problem
that
i
find
in
just
about
every
foreignexport
stout
it
isnt
complex
or
interesting
as
an
imperial
stout
and
it
isnt
nearly
as
sessionable
as
an
irish
dry
stout
schlafly
irishstyle
extra
stout
is
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
style
that
ive
had
robust
tasty
and
a
steal
at
the
price
of
99
cents
per
bottle
that
i
stumbled
upon
last
night
but
i
cant
envision
many
times
where
id
want
this
particular
combination
of
flavor
abv
good
beer
though
12
ounce
bottle
with
about
8
ounces
poured
into
a
snifter
glass
little
to
no
head
in
the
pour
despite
my
attempts
to
get
something
out
of
it
what
little
head
their
is
collects
in
a
small
ring
at
the
outside
of
the
glass
pours
a
very
dark
black
the
consistency
of
motor
oil
smells
surprisingly
fruity
with
notes
of
raisin
followed
by
the
typical
stout
smell
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
some
almond
notes
are
there
too
surprisingly
bubbly
on
the
palate
with
the
roasted
chocolate
followed
by
more
roasted
notes
and
some
coffee
hop
character
is
there
but
not
exactly
easy
to
find
and
its
mainly
in
the
finish
hard
to
believe
this
is
an
extra
stout
with
the
8
abv
one
would
expect
this
to
be
heavy
almost
syrupy
but
thats
not
the
case
its
actually
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
the
only
area
that
i
scored
the
beer
lower
on
and
really
its
not
the
beers
fault
a
stout
this
good
is
not
meant
for
heavy
consumption
only
slow
drinking
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
bit
too
far
on
the
roasty
side
to
be
a
traditional
export
stout
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
not
a
tasty
beer
well
worth
a
shot
pours
engine
oil
black
that
no
light
can
penetrate
nice
tan
head
but
it
quickly
disappears
aroma
is
roasty
and
sweet
with
coffee
bitter
cocoa
and
some
licorice
notes
the
nose
seems
a
bit
sweet
for
a
dry
stout
flavor
is
quite
nice
and
has
a
surprising
smokiness
to
it
as
one
would
expect
the
predominant
flavors
are
of
roasted
malts
as
bitter
chocolate
and
coffee
less
chalky
yeast
character
than
most
true
english
styles
very
little
hop
flavor
but
definitely
has
the
level
of
bitterness
a
dry
stout
requires
as
mentioned
before
i
am
getting
a
definite
smokey
character
or
perhaps
it
is
just
black
patent
definitely
unique
and
a
welcome
addition
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
dry
stout
and
though
i
worried
after
the
aroma
that
it
would
be
too
sweet
it
is
nicely
dry
and
quite
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
bit
sticky
but
not
a
deal
breaker
by
any
means
very
drinkable
and
noticing
that
this
is
8
abv
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
is
not
just
very
but
extremely
drinkable
while
this
stout
isnt
an
endall
or
perhaps
overly
memorable
its
still
a
beer
that
id
reach
for
seeing
it
on
the
stores
shelf
d
this
went
down
easily
and
i
would
certainly
have
another
the
slight
astringent
taste
on
the
finish
prohibits
me
from
giving
this
more
of
a
boost
d
despite
the
abv
i
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
the
complex
flavors
and
sweetness
are
perfectly
balanced
with
the
alcohol
to
create
a
stout
i
will
look
for
next
winter
chock
full
of
chocolate
this
isnt
quite
ris
milkshake
territory
but
it
drinks
like
chocolate
milk
full
rich
and
chocolatey
a
bit
of
roast
with
tobacco
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
briefly
not
at
all
cloying
though
theres
a
good
deal
of
sweetness
in
the
form
of
chocolate
and
fried
plantain
flavors
possibly
the
best
ive
tried
from
schlafly
they
should
make
a
blend
of
this
with
their
stellar
pumpkin
ale
this
has
always
been
a
schlafly
favorite
of
mine
very
bold
and
full
of
flavor
this
years
really
seems
to
shine
abv
is
a
bit
high
but
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
pours
a
dark
black
color
12
inch
head
of
a
dark
tan
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
roasted
malt
hops
slight
alcohol
and
slight
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
foreign
export
stout
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
roasted
malt
slight
sweet
malt
slight
alcohol
and
slight
yeast
mdvery
smooth
silky
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
with
a
heavy
to
medium
heavy
body
not
sure
i
could
drink
alot
of
them
in
a
session
but
this
is
an
incredible
offering
from
schafly
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
i
liked
this
one
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
overall
a
decent
enough
brew
lacking
depth
but
drinkable
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
lingering
head
that
reducing
quickly
to
a
white
cap
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
malty
foretaste
with
an
alcohol
burn
on
the
finish
no
noticeable
hop
flavor
seems
like
guinness
with
alcohol
added
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
i
can
drink
this
fairly
easily
but
i
really
dont
care
to
this
is
not
a
repeat
purchase
next
there
is
good
drinkability
on
this
stout
this
is
also
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
would
never
turn
it
down
well
ive
decided
that
im
going
back
for
this
one
its
a
very
drinkable
export
with
no
trace
of
booziness
at
all
just
a
real
treat
i
liked
it
a
lot
drinking
this
one
right
now
pours
a
hearty
black
with
some
brown
hues
around
the
edges
thin
mocha
head
fades
quickly
but
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
like
roasted
coffee
chocolate
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
hops
tastes
just
like
it
smells
very
smooth
just
a
touch
overcarbed
covers
the
alcohol
well
could
drink
a
bunch
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
the
stout
appears
a
hazed
dark
brown
color
with
about
two
fingers
of
fluffy
ecru
foam
the
head
sticks
around
for
a
few
minutes
before
ebbing
to
a
thin
layer
notes
of
both
milk
and
dark
chocolate
fresh
roasted
grains
bitter
coffee
dry
cocoa
sweet
caramelized
malt
are
present
in
the
taste
and
aroma
i
was
surprised
to
read
this
one
clocks
in
at
8
you
certainly
dont
notice
it
while
drinking
dry
finish
and
a
body
slightly
better
than
medium
with
ample
carbonation
for
an
export

suprisingly
refresing
for
a

boasts
8
percent
abv
i
woke
up
this
st
patricks
day
with
a
craving
for
an
easy
to
drink
stout
with
alot
of
flavorand
alcohol
glad
to
let
you
know
i
found
it
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
schlafly
but
this
was
a
disappointment
the
first
schlafly
i
had
that
i
wasnt
knocked
over
with
bad
batch
perhaps
thank
you
schlafly
poured
this
one
in
a
couple
of
different
glasses
and
was
surprised
that
it
tasted
best
in
a
chimay
goblet
pours
black
unless
held
up
to
light
with
a
moderate
sized
brown
tinted
head
smell
is
roasty
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
was
wonderful
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
are
apparent
up
front
the
finish
is
spicy
and
slightly
hoppy
the
spice
at
the
end
reminded
me
a
little
of
the
spiciness
in
chimay
blue
mouthfeel
is
oily
and
cloying
this
stout
is
moderatelty
carbonated
drinkability
is
not
very
high
it
is
so
rich
that
after
about
four
it
gets
to
be
a
little
much
my
favorite
stout
yet
but
ive
never
had
a
foreign
export
style
stout
before
i
wish
they
were
more
available
this
beer
pours
an
almost
opaque
black
at
first
thought
was
completely
black
but
upon
holding
it
to
the
light
there
is
the
slightest
hints
of
ruby
highlights
there
is
a
one
finger
head
that
recedes
relatively
quickly
slight
slight
lacing
left
behind
nose
is
predominantly
of
coffee
and
caramel
with
a
very
apparent
boozy
scent
as
well
taste
is
very
sweet
up
front
mixed
with
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
alcohol
is
very
apparent
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
oily
on
the
tongue
at
first
but
the
finish
is
on
the
drier
side
medium
to
heavy
body
medium
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
alcohol
presence
in
the
taste
makes
it
a
beer
that
i
could
only
have
one
or
two
of
in
an
evening
d
this
is
a
full
fledged
stout
that
being
said
i
love
stouts
and
this
is
a
nice
surprise
d
a
pleasant
drink
i
wouldnt
mind
another
someday
drinkability
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
for
me
itd
be
a
lovely
every
day
kind
of
stout
d
even
at
8
fully
flavored
and
full
bodied
this
brew
is
still
pretty
drinkable
very
tasty
im
actually
very
happily
surprised
with
this
d
imo
its
just
ok
i
came
across
this
at
lukas
liquor
in
st
louis
and
was
glad
i
did
it
ended
up
going
perfectly
with
a
st
patricks
day
feast
this
stout
looked
perfect
in
a
pint
glass
what
surprised
me
most
was
the
creaminess
and
sweetness
that
it
had
i
was
expecting
it
to
have
a
much
more
dry
feeling
to
it
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
rich
it
was
i
highly
reccommend
this
brew
to
anyone
it
pours
a
dark
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
that
does
not
linger
around
for
too
long
it
smells
sweet
with
some
malts
chocolate
and
black
licorice
the
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
chocolatecocoa
that
fades
into
a
burnt
malt
and
coffee
taste
with
a
tad
kick
of
hops
at
the
very
end
the
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
but
a
bit
thin
overall
this
is
a
very
good
export
stout
and
matches
up
to
the
few
others
i
have
had
being
8
and
having
such
rich
flavors
it
is
hard
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
12
brown
head
over
the
cloudy
reddish
brown
brew
head
fades
at
a
moderate
speed
with
average
lacing
aroma
is
roasty
grains
taste
is
dark
sweet
maltiness
upfront
with
a
notsodry
close
with
wisps
of
alcohol
coming
into
play
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
the
8abv
could
sneak
up
on
the
unaware
hmmm
while
i
apprecitated
the
almost
nonexistant
taste
of
its
8
abv
i
found
that
the
jacked
up
sweetness
to
achieve
this
was
just
a
tad
too
much
but
not
quite
cloying
for
me
to
enjoy
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
if
you
like
your
stouts
extra
sweet
this
is
a
good
one
d
this
ones
stronger
than
i
thought
it
was
still
works
great
as
a
nightcap
though
per
the
label
bottled
jan

2007
thanks
to
rysberg01
for
this
beer
im
really
impresed
with
this
offering
to
my
taste
this
is
truly
an
nice
example
of
an
export
stout
rather
than
than
an
extra
stout
and
the
abv
supports
it
very
akin
toa
caribbean
stout
like
those
found
there
from
guiness
and
ceres
this
style
is
a
little
highr
in
alcohol
an
a
bit
sweeter
than
an
irish
dry
stout
this
stout
well
represents
the
style
pours
a
dark
brown
with
an
okay
head
that
settles
to
a
ring
smells
a
little
roasty
a
little
sweet
a
little
nutty
almost
salty
as
well
the
taste
is
also
somewhat
nutty
creamy
and
only
somewhat
roasty
some
vanilla
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
unbelievably
creamy
and
it
is
a
real
creaminess
instead
of
tricks
with
widgets
introducing
nitrogen
smooth
and
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
d
not
quite
as
high
due
to
the
weather
getting
warmer
but
still
a
damn
fine
extra
stout
from
schlafly
since
it
is
a
winter
release
get
it
now
while
you
still
can
smooth
mouthfeel
and
easy
to
drink
surprised
this
is
8
can
hardly
taste
half
of
it
not
bad
overall
a
good
stout
a
heavyweight
that
could
have
benefited
from
a
bit
more
robust
malt
however
thanks
to
brentk56
for
the
sample
thanks
vancer
for
the
opportunity
im
not
sure
it
is
worth
the
extra
that
this
is
charged
for
as
a
seasonal
9
99
for
a
six
pack
this
is
still
very
good
though
if
i
have
any
left
over
to
cellar
after
tonight
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
happens
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
good
stout
to
seek
out
if
in
the
st
louis
area
there
was
some
lacing
as
i
consumed
the
beer
but
it
was
very
minimal
i
tried
to
get
more
out
of
the
aroma
but
failed
still
this
was
enjoyable
and
i
will
take
it
easy
and
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
sixer
at
a
later
date
i
have
some
of
this
that
i
cellared
last
year
so
i
am
anxious
to
see
how
it
has
cellared
dont
see
this
style
everyday
aside
from
the
guiness
version
or
a
few
homebrewers
the
beer
begins
with
a
deep
dark
brown
color
and
promises
a
viscous
texture
good
head
formation
and
retention
of
the
tan
variety
showing
fair
lacing
later
aromas
are
sweetly
malty
with
a
firm
followup
of
roasted
grains
not
overly
complex
but
rich
and
clean
with
a
light
lactose
twang
in
the
nose
flavors
provide
much
more
malt
sweetness
but
not
to
dwarf
the
roasted
charcoal
malts
hints
of
espresso
and
cocoa
decorate
the
brew
but
never
dominated
hopped
for
bitterness
but
no
decernable
flavoring
leaving
the
bitterness
and
flavor
from
the
roasted
grains
to
give
roundness
and
palatability
decently
weighted
and
creamy
in
the
texture
albeit
too
sweet
on
the
teeth
finishes
still
sweet
with
a
firm
shadow
of
roasted
malt
a
really
nice
beer
but
probably
a
bit
too
sweet
caramel
for
the
style
appreciated
but
its
no
guinness
d
outstanding
im
really
really
impressed
with
this
stout
one
of
the
most
drinkable
of
its
style
that
ive
ever
encountered
good
sipping
beer
with
moderate
alchohol
8
im
planning
to
throw
some
beef
into
this
stuff
and
pop
it
on
the
grill
its
begging
for
the
barbie
d
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
style
but
i
know
i
like
this
beer
big
on
flavor
big
on
booze
no
run
of
the
mill
stout
doesnt
give
away
its
alcohol
content
in
the
taste
but
i
cant
help
but
notice
the
effects
or
am
i
just
sleepy
anyway
i
think
i
prefer
lion
stout
but
its
still
nice
to
have
a
good
export
stout
brewed
in
my
area
keep
up
the
good
work
schlafly
jet
black
body
shows
only
a
little
light
when
held
up
to
the
light
milk
chocolate
colored
head
starts
at
about
an
inch
but
quickly
fades
to
just
a
skim
nose
is
a
spicey
super
zesty
shock
to
the
senses
the
presence
of
grain
alchol
lets
you
know
this
is
no
5
brew
wow
as
this
hits
the
mouth
you
get
a
creamy
coffee
and
chocolate
mix
smooth
and
well
balanced
darkness
includes
notes
of
anise
molases
and
chicory
coffee
feel
stays
on
the
mouth
and
is
welcome
by
me
lovely
and
very
drinkable
i
should
have
bought
a
case
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
good
kick
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
little
while
if
youre
ok
with
the
sweetness
its
a
good
beer
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
if
these
but
after
that
i
would
look
for
something
a
little
lighter
d
decent
brew
nothing
ground
breaking
but
tasty
none
the
less
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
sour
twang
at
the
beginning
of
the
beer
wasnt
planned
but
you
never
know
it
wasnt
enough
to
really
deter
from
the
flavor
d
not
as
refined
as
other
export
style
stouts
a
bit
rough
and
the
roasted
character
is
not
as
defined
and
in
your
face
as
i
had
expected
still
a
good
beer
no
doubt
about
that
i
just
think
it
misses
the
mark
for
the
style
a
little
bit
d
starts
bitter
and
harsh
but
you
get
used
to
it
in
fact
it
actually
becomes
more
palatable
and
nearly
enjoyable
halfway
through
it
might
be
because
of
it
warming
up
a
little
and
more
flavor
comes
out
countering
the
sharp
bitter
cheers
d
excellent
tasting
beer
here
with
nice
complexities
and
good
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
also
very
appealing
and
obviously
works
very
well
with
this
style
thanks
again
to
vancer
for
this
sweet
notsolittle
stout
d
a
pretty
good
stout
nothing
amazing
but
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
the
tap
version
is
preferred
but
id
drink
either
anytime
probably
at
least
two
overall
i
like
this
better
than
schlaflys
coffee
stout
which
has
a
harsh
side
but
i
dont
think
it
justifies
its
9
price
tag
perhaps
that
was
simply
opportunistic
pricing
for
st
patricks
day
d
alcohol
went
unnoticed
i
didnt
even
realize
it
was
8
0
until
i
started
my
review
needless
to
say
that
it
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
me
from
drinking
more
than
a
few
in
one
sitting
excellent
stout
this
is
exactly
what
i
think
an
irish
stout
should
be
like
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
offering
from
schlafly
when
poured
it
looks
like
any
other
good
stout
and
the
nose
is
the
same
the
taste
is
where
this
beer
shines
very
good
with
roasted
bitterness
balanced
by
just
a
little
caramel
sweetness
excellent
body
and
an
extremely
clean
finish
probably
the
best
finish
of
any
stout
ive
ever
tasted
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
and
at
8
that
could
be
dangerous
excellent
work
from
the
folks
at
schlafly
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewerytap
room
and
a
new
batch
had
just
been
released
on
feb
2
2007
served
in
a
snifter
it
had
an
excellent
aroma
and
good
complex
flavor
combining
smooth
roast
and
sweet
malts
it
was
very
drinkable
the
8
abv
was
very
well
hidden
blackishred
in
color
and
only
a
small
creamy
tan
head
which
was
not
longlasting
compared
to
other
irish
stouts
im
not
a
fan
of
sweet
stouts
and
this
one
is
perfect
for
me
this
is
another
fine
product
from
schlafly
and
a
stout
that
ill
definitely
have
in
my
fridge
taste
is
pretty
sweet
up
front
with
more
of
the
chocolate
noted
in
the
nose
there
is
also
some
nutty
and
roasted
malt
character
fruit
and
some
noticeable
hops
the
roasted
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
and
the
beer
finishes
slightly
dry
definitely
an
easy
drinker
for
an
8
abv
pretty
good
stout
in
my
opinion
and
i
think
those
that
enjoy
a
sweeter
stout
will
think
likewise
smooth
medium
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
a
bit
milder
roast
and
slightly
sweeter
than
some
irish
stouts
but
very
well
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
well
worth
a
try
overall
its
a
fairly
unique
irish
dry
its
sweet
to
be
sure
without
quite
being
an
english
style
stout
its
missing
the
more
acrid
bitterness
of
the
roasted
malts
that
usually
appears
in
dry
stouts
its
bitter
as
it
should
be
and
appropriately
without
hop
aroma
its
also
easy
to
drink
in
spite
of
the
8
abv
perhaps
not
my
favorite
offering
from
what
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
it
isnt
shabby
either
id
recommend
it
to
stout
lovers
solid
medium
body
not
a
lot
of
roasted
barley
flavor
for
a
stout
plenty
of
malt
flavor
otherwise
a
long
dry
finish
with
some
coffee
flavors
it
had
a
little
sour
twang
to
it
that
took
my
flavor
rating
down
a
bit
improved
as
it
warmed
and
i
had
already
left
it
out
for
a
while
before
opening
pretty
easy
drinking
for
an
8
brew
served
at
a
nice
temperature
as
all
brews
this
brew
slid
down
smooth
and
silky

not
a
dry
stout
at
all
just
wish
they
put
it
in
a
manly
glass
instead
of
the
wimpy
snifter
overall
the
beer
is
a
decent
export
stout
and
very
good
novelty
gift
for
the
beer
geek
in
your
life
even
if
it
isnt
a
gift
the
beer
is
still
overall
pretty
decent
and
drinkable
ill
definitely
be
keeping
my
eye
out
for
this
every
holiday
probably
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
thin
and
boozy
not
much
smell
or
flavor
to
this
beer
aroma
of
cocoa

roasted
malt

of
coffee

nice
stout
slightly
sweet
with

that
isnt

bitter
a

bitterness
follows
light
carbonation
a
bit
more
than
i
want
in
a
stout
but
not
over
the
top
8
abv
for
this
brew
a
decent
option
for
a
cold
winter
night
overall
better
than
i
thought
ti
would
be
i
had
it
figured
for
a
holiday
seasonal
gimmick
but
its
a
pretty
decent
stout
i
would
have
it
again
something
to
try
once
certainly
if
its
a
gift
overall
yeah
i
dig
this
and
i
dig
it
as
a
foreignexport
stout
merry
christmas
bas
solid
stout
great
taste
and
good
feel
my
wife
summed
this
one
up
perfectly
its
a
stout
id
be
hard
pressed
to
pay
6
99
for
this
again
but
with
that
being
said
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
just
nothing

overall
ah
a
decent
brew
but
really
not
that
special
and
not
what
i
would
consider
a
dark
roastad
as
black
as
the
lump
of
coal
youll
be
getting
for
christmas
as
proclaimed
by
the
label
tastes
amazing
super
dark
and
chocolate
disappointing
brew
as
i
have
saved
this
for
two
years
before
drinking
not
a
true
stout
unimpressive
wish
i
would
have
read
about
it
before
buying
it
is
not
bad
just
not
at
all
a
stout
and
not
worth
the
price
i
paid
6
49
at
a
specialty
beer
store
it

that
is

after

this
is

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
for
the
abv
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
best
part
of
this
beer
was
the
label
stout
my
ass
tastes
like
old
ale
baltic
porter
quad
and
stout
all
mixed
together
way
malty
yes
is
complex
in
the
fact
that
there
are
a
lot
of
different
flavors
but
not
in
a
good
way
imo
i
like
the
malt
profile
the
sherry
character
is
likely
attributable
to
age
but
it
neither
adds
nor
detracts
really
im
not
digging
the
fake
cherry
though
misses
a
lot
of
body
and
malt
for
a
stout
the
body
was
thin
if
you
consider
this
a
stout
but
right
on
for
a
strongold
ale
smooth
all
across
the
tongue
with
a
semi
dry
finish
overall
a
very
good
brew
one
that
i
will
certainly
grab
again
if
i
see
it
and
i
think
its
worth
your
time
as
well
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
stale
dark
breads
touches
of
milk
chocolate
instant
coffee
and
bakers
chocolate
low
amounts
of
diacetyl
seem
to
be
present
as
well
with
a
light
buttered
popcorn
character
touches
of
spicy
licorice
occasionally
brush
against
the
nostrils
but
they
are
light
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
bready
sweet
with
a
mild
bitter
roast
touches
of
coffeelike
acidity
and
the
briefest
of
alcoholic
pops
just
at
the
close
hop
bitterness
builds
as
you
sip
the
beer
and
eventually
hits
slightly
unbalanced
levels
the
finish
is
drier
with
a
mild
bitter
roast
in
flavor
the
beer
begins
as
softly
chary
coffee
moving
into
roast
grains
and
toasted
bread
the
middle
and
finish
carry
lots
of
herbal
and
medicinal
bitters
that
hurt
other
flavors
in
the
beer
touches
of
licorice
bakers
chocolate
and
caramel
touch
across
the
tongue
but
are
kept
light
due
to
the
mildly
aggressive
bitter
flavoring
that
mingles
with
slight
char
flavors
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
in
body
with
a
middling
soft
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
smooth
and
almostcreamy
mouthfeel
the
bitters
give
the
mouth
a
slightly
sharp
feeling
which
is
off
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
overall
this
is
an
average
export
stout
that
suffers
from
a
bad
blending
of
its
bitters
with
the
other
rich
flavors
of
the
beer
it
is
not
overly
bitter
by
any
means
but
just
feels
a
touch
too
bitter
for
the
style
for
a
dark
holiday
stout
i
was
also
expecting
more
rich
malt
character
but
it
was
fairly
mellow
with
it
malt
character
this
beer
is
not
horrible
but
is
rather
forgettable
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
i
liked
it
more
as
i
drank
more
of
it
it
hides
its
8
nicely
i
would
advise
serving
this
at
room
temperature
i
just
realized
it
this
resembles
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
more
than
any
stout
in
color
smell
carbonation
and
even
flavor
its
not
terribly
complex
but
at
least
it
appeals
to
my
affinity
for
dark
belgian
ales
lump
of
coal
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
white
lacing
head
there
is
a
weak
toffee
aroma
the
taste
also
is
weak
lots
of
toffee
with
a
very
dry
aftertaste
weak
watery
flavors
overall
its
decent
weak
and
watery
but
in
no
ways
horrible
a
bit
borring
pours
a
nearly
black
body
that
appears
clear
dark
red
under
the
light
with
a
fingers
worth
of
khaki
foam
looks
good
leaves
behind
some
patches
of
foam
and
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
awfully
mundane
sweet
milk
chocolate
faint
vanilla
bitter
roasted
malts
and
not
much
else
taste
follows
the
nose
with
the
addition
of
smoke
smoke
and
a
plasticy
finish
like
a
muted
rauchbier
with
some
artificial
vanilla
why
is
it
so
roasty
the
saving
grace
here
is
the
mouth
feel
which
is
full
and
creamy
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
the
light
smokey
thing
it
has
going
on
is
less
than
welcome
in
my
opinion
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
cola
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
is
coffee
some
chocolate
alcohol
is
well
hidden
smooth
and
easy
drinking
feels
a
bit
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
still
i
am
charmed
by
this
beer
and
of
various
holiday
offerings
i
have
tried
this
ranks
in
the
upper
echelon
nice
beer
for
a
cold
minnesota
winters
night
export
stouts
are
my
least
preferred
stout
so
its
hard
for
me
to
find
one
that
impresses
me
and
this
is
no
exception
this
brew
is
drinkable
but
perfectly
forgettable
in
my
estimation
not
bad
though
it
seems
like
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
the
strength
doesnt
show
either
its
an
8
brew
that
drinks
like
a
4
looks
alright
and
the
aroma
is
decent
but
the
flavour
seems
rather
muted
some
more
roasted
malt
notesbitterness
would
be
nice
body
is
ok
if
a
little
flat
i
guess
for
the
abv
i
expected
a
more
complex
flavour
profile
and
a
longer
finish
a
reasonable
christmas
beer
that
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
expectations
worth
trying
but
no
need
to
seek
it
out
nothing
too
memorable
but
an
enjoyable
export
stout
overall
o
an
interesting
novelty
beer
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
holiday
brew
other
than
the
sweetness
an
average
sweet
stout
with
an
above
average
aroma
and
a
funny
story
on
the

httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
the
darkness
reigns
in
this
beer
overall
pretty
good
for
a
smaller
english
stout
nice
roasty
flavors
and
balanced
sweetness
overall
the
idea
of
a
christmas
stout
is
interesting
but
this
brew
doesnt
live
up
to
expectationsits
got
the
makings
of
a
holiday
ale
or
lager
but
there
is
plenty
left
to
be
desired
like
a
thicker
dispositionwhile
it
is
warming
my
belly
i
think
most
of
that
is
from
the
higher
abv
and
not
necessarily
the
cinnamon
and
clovethe
spices
are
not
crisp
leaving
a
slightly
heavy
overdone
taste
in
my
mouthill
finish
this
one

dont
think
ill
be
looking
for
anotherthere
are

this
a
very
pleasant
beer
with
a
nice
finish
i
would
recommend
to
friends
and
family
i
could
even
see
doing
this
beer
as
a
session
beer
if
it
were
on
tap
somewhere
this
was
a
pretty
disappointing
beer
everything
was
a
bit
watered
down
none
of
the
flavors
were
pronounced
or
forward
it
also
had
a
distinct
colalike
flavor
that
im
really
not
fond
of
in
my
beer
this
is
a
beer
i
will
pass
up
in
the
future
solid
not
must
try
smells
of
licorice
a
splash
of
black
coffee
and
a
light
amount
of
char
roast
tastes
of
both
milk
and
dark
chocolate
with
a
lesser
amount
of
licorice
than
the
nose
and
a
hint
of
burnt
fruitiness
around
the
edges
of
the
other
flavors
that
amplifies
as
the
glass
warms
up
my
token
criticism
is
that
i
would
have
liked
for
that
fruitiness
and
roasted
character
to
show
up
at
a
higher
level
depth
than
what
i
received
review
from
12010
notes
poured
into
a
caracole
small
snifter
pours
a
dark
brown
appearing
black
faint
aroma
of
light
malt
and
dark
fruits
flavors
are
typical
english
dry
stout
light
toasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
burnt
coffee
dark
fruit
flavor
is
fairly
subdued
light
to
medium
bodied
pleasant
but
not
a
great
stout
still
one
of
the
better
ridgeways
which
tend
to
be
rather
bland
in
flavor
imho
overall
a
one
and
done
you
cant
do
2
of
these
one
after
the
other
rich
and
sweetbitter
good
complexity
but
not
a
true
stout
i
liked
this
but
not
enough
to
go
after
this
as
a
must
have
i
like
the
complexity
and
the
quality
of
the
brew
my
advice
share
this
o
it
was
ok
but
i
cant
say
id
buy
another
just
not
a
big
flavor
profile
no
warming
roast
or
complexity
that
id
want
from
a
midrange
stout
o
basically
a
good
beer
that
is
fairly
one
dimensional
was
enjoyable
enough
but
as
a
holiday
beer
because
of
the
sweet
factor
the
smell
is
definitely
not
inline
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
o
an
average
effort
at
a
foreignexport
stout
doesnt
hold
8
necessarily
well
with
an
unbalanced
flavor
profile
this
a
a
decent
stout
representative
nicely
balanced
between
scent
taste
and
mouthfeel
better
than
average
and
worth
checking
out
subtle
and
worthy
for
the
style
would
not
buy
again
would
not
recommend
to
anyone
would
still
drink
it
if
offered
to
me
nice
different
holiday
dark
brew
pours
literally
coal
black
no
transparency
with
a
smallish
white
head
frothy
smells
a
little
dark
fruity
with
good
rich
roasted
malts
and
a
heavy
sturdy
yeast
flavor
is
low
key
but
different
there
is
a
pronounced
fruity
malty
lightness
if
thats
doable
mouthfeel
is
nice
less
carbonated
than
it
could
be
with
a
full
body
and
a
pungent
but
complimentary
to
its
flavor
and
aroma
finishing
kick
english
for
sure
the
malts
make
this
one
at
8
the
value
is
great
very
drinkable
i
am
an
elf
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
thin
film
covering
with
a
slightly
heavier
ring
around
the
glass
effervescent
aromas
of
coffee
and
dark
fruit
with
roasty
toasty
tones
the
flavors
are
rich
with
a
dark
chocolate
highlight
over
the
roasted
coffee
flavors
lighter
bodied
for
a
stout
with
no
cling
left
behind
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
sweet
notes
with
a
coffee
bitter
to
balance
and
a
fairly
quick
slick
finish
decent
but
not
spectacular
taste
is
fairly
straightforward
roasted
malt
up
front
and
is
the
primary
flavor
a
burnt
bitterness
follows
in
the
aftertaste
soft
carbonation
adds
a
bit
of
creaminess
even
though
its
interrupted
by
a
semidry
finish
strength
is
very
well
hidden
though
doa
this
one
was
pretty
tasty
and
drank
easy
for
the
8
percent
worth
trying
once
maybe
if
you
count
the
sweet
malt
and
general
grassy
hops
that
are
overdone
blegh
i
honestly
didnt
expect
much
from
this
beer
what
a
pleasant
surprise
its
a
deep
thick
dark
high
viscosity
brew
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
intense
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
licorice
dark
fruits
cherry
and
a
bit
of
smoke
and
charcoal
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
anticipated
rich
luxurious
and
balanced
with
a
nononsense
bitterness
fruit
roast
and
lots
of
grain
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
substantial
filling
is
an
understatement
mmmm
christmas
onot
bad
but
for
the
price
there
are
a
lot
of
better
examples
notes
a
nice
sweet
stout
pours
black
as
nite
with
reddish
brown
highlights
a
half
finger
of
tan
head
quickly
and
loudly
like
fizz
in
soda
settled
to
a
spotty
froth
on
top
the
nose
is
very
weak
for
a
stout
not
getting
any
roast
or
chocolate
or
hops
just
beer
taste
is
slightly
bettter
with
a
little
chocolate
flavor
but
very
weak
and
disappointing
mouthfeel
is
o
k
at
first
goes
down
smooth
but
then
leaves
a
bad
aspirin
bitter
flavor
behind
that
lingers
for
ever
at
seven
dollars
a
pint
and
the
muted
flavors
i
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
big
downside
is
price
id
pay
1012
bucks
for
a
six
pack
of
12oz
bottles
but
at
6
99
for
a
single
bottle
i
probably
wont
buy
again
just
because
of
economics
but
it
was
good
and
worth
a
try
it
was
an
enjoyable
beer
but
im
not
going
to
walk
a
quarter
mile
for
it
from
the
bottle
marked
f13245
sampled
on
december
13
2011
the
pour
is
mainly
dark
brown
with
ruby
red
hues
glistening
around
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
minimal
on
the
nose
there
are
a
variety
of
scents
including
sweet
malts
cherry
and
later
spent
coffee
grinds
the
body
texture
falls
into
the
thin
to
medium
range
the
taste
is
a
little
more
mellow
with
the
same
mixture
of
malts
cherry
and
coffee
grinds
with
the
slightest
hint
of
clean
crisp
hops
at
the
finish
not
much
stout
its
okay
nothing
about
makes
it
me
want
to
revisit
though
i
had
no
idea
that
this
beer
vas
that
strong
8
i
had
guessed
5
or
so
a
fine
english
stout
that
sadly
was
served
way
too
cold
so
if
you
have
been
naughty
this
year
put
this
on
your
shopping
list
cause
santa
already
has
a
different
lump
of
coal
waiting
for
you
glad
i
tried
it
always
nice
to
have
something
different
not
sure
if
i
would
have
again
o
decent
export
stout
easily
drinkable
just
not
enough
body
to
make
it
excellent
o
not
bad
i
plan
to
cellar
one
and
try
it
again
in
a
year
there
are
others
i
prefer
for
this
category
overall
i
was
not
really
a
impressed
with
this
beer
as
i
was
expecting
a
nice
stout
with
maybe
some
holiday
flavors
instead
i
got
a
really
sweet
beer
with
mostly
odd
flavors
overall
seems
like
bottled
english
beer
doesnt
always
deliver
but
i
like
this
one
pretty
well
o
not
a
bad
brew
to
pick
up
and
try
not
something
id
really
remember
or
recommend
to
others
as
a
standout
in
the
stouts
though
o
not
bad
but
would
not
buy
this
again
at
the
price
this
beer
would
rock
some
socks
off
if
it
was
more
ingredient
heavy
mosdef
not
a
consolation
for
being
a
bad
boy
but
not
a
punishment
either
good
thing
i
was
good
this
year
i
did
like
the
charcoal
notes
but
they
were
very
subtle
overall
it
was
decent
interesting
flavors
and
moderate
drinkability
o
this
one
was
much
better
than
i
expected
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
some
offwhite
bubbles
but
not
real
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
with
some
anise
notes
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
almost
identical
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
are
what
really
stands
out
but
the
licoriceanise
notes
are
in
the
flavor
as
well
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
great
but
one
of
the
better
ridgeway
beers
i
have
tried
it
has
a
very
smooth
civilized
taste
it
works
very
nicely
not
too
cold
i
probably
would
never
buy
it
again
since
the
single
bottle
was
a
bit
pricey
even
with
a
buck
or
two
off
this
stout
poured
out
as
a
dark
brown
color
the
beer
is
almost
translucent
despite
the
color
the
head
is
thin
and
tan
colored
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
roasted
and
has
some
earthy
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
light
and
creamy
the
flavors
dont
really
have
a
bitterness
of
coffee
or
dark
burnt
toast
its
one
of
the
smoothest
tasting
stouts
ive
had
in
a
while
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
not
really
complex
at
all
overall
its
an
easy
going
stout
o
relatively
boring
would
sooner
pick
many
other
brews
before
this
one
pretty
subpar
stout
and
flawed
stout
all
marketing
not
much
substance
a
very
easy
drinking
stout
the
high
abv
is
very
well
hidden
dark
fruit
sweetness
is
well
matched
with
the
smokey
dark
grain
bitterness
plenty
of
subtle
interesting
flavor
a
good
dallop
of
nuttiness
and
toffee
out
of
this
one
easy
drinking
enough
slight
plum
and
raisin
feel
to
it
keeps
the
bitterness
in
check
good
price
on
it
under
4
might
go
back
to
this
one
once
a
year
around
the
holidays
a
little
changeup
for
that
time
of
year
o
this
is
just
kind
of
meh
palate
is
rich
and
malty
up
front
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
some
lactose
sweetness
a
mild
dose
of
dark
fruit
cherries
and
a
little
bit
of
cocoa
powder
come
through
on
the
swallow
finish
is
sweet
but
mostly
dry
body
is
full
and
creamy
but
not
overly
thick
still
this
is
somehow
not
the
most
drinkable
beer
around
i
guess
because
of
the
strength
a
good
bit
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
lingers
on
the
finish
cheers
d
a
good
effort
for
sure
opinion
well
this
beer
is
going
to
make
a
lasting
impression
on
me
with
just
the
one
sip
i
have
had
so
far
it
is
pretty
rough
to
say
the
least
the
aroma
was
ok
but
man
once
you
get
into
the
flavor
it
is
a
ride
for
the
palate
and
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
a
pleasant
one
i
would
steer
clear
of
this
one
if
i
were
you
not
worth
the
5
or
6
bucks
i
spent
and
lets
be
honest
weve
all
been
there
d
reading
other
reviews
the
qc
issue
with
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
hit
or
miss
i
wish
i
could
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
was
meant
to
be
and
im
sure
itd
be
great
pretty
good
nice
little
stout
i
would
have
again
d
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
lump
of
coal
tastes
a
lot
like
guinness
to
me
id
never
guess
it
was
an
8
d
any
traces
of
alcohol
are
well
hidden
from
the
taste
which
makes
this
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
see
drinkability
drink
its
different
that
i
thought
but
pretty
good
again
the
wife
tried
i
give
her
credit
roasted
flavors
come
out
again
in
the
taste
backed
by
a
slightly
sweeter
chocolate
characteristic
than
what
was
found
in
the
smell
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
is
also
there
as
the
beer
finishes
with
tastes
of
dark
fruit
the
roasted
qualities
combine
well
with
the
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
to
create
a
very
interesting
stout
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
just
about
where
i
like
it
for
a
stout
definitely
a
solid
holiday
offering
from
ridgeway
as
well
as
just
a
decent
stout
which
seems
harder
and
harder
to
find
ill
be
back
for
more
next
year
youd
never
know
the
alcohol
level
was
high
the
sweet
creaminess
begs
you
to
keep
on
sipping
meh
in
the
future
ill
leave
this
one
in
my
stocking
d
wouldnt
buy
it
again
could
have
been
a
good
stout
but
its
not
export
stout
drinkability
a
good
basic
stout
drinkability
a
good
effort
and
a
tasty
brew
i
dont
think
you
would
want
to
drink
more
than
two
a
night
bye
a
slightly
above
average
beer
in
my
opinion
but
at
9
i
wont
be
having
any
more
anytime
soon
overall
this
is
a
well
made
drinkable
stout
but
it
is
largely
forgetable
espeically
for
the
abv
and
inflated
imported
price
tag
its
quite
filling
so
the
drink
ability
is
a
little
low
i
might
be
able
to
have
another
one
of
these
d
glad
i
gave
it
a
shot
but
wont
be
back
to
it
the
taste
of
this
brew
is
just
about
like
any
other
stout
from
england
with
a
burning
ethyl
finish
it
is
light
semisweet
chocolate
and
butter
mixed
together
a
cola
like
middle
and
an
herbal
and
leathery
finish
feels
a
little
thin
for
the
lower
abv
but
again
the
ethyl
kick
in
the
end
is
a
little
much
meets
the
stout
visual
standards
black
hue
two
finger
tan
head
roastlike
aromas
burst
out
of
the
bottle
upon
its
opening
smells
like
an
amber
ale
what
thin
body
malty
but
not
roasty
noticeable
carbonation
definitely
leaning
towards
darker
flavors
sweet
bitter
milk
chocolate
roasted
after
taste
the
body
to
this
beer
definitely
effects
the
presentation
of
this
beers
taste
i
cant
help
but
noticing
that
taste
a
lot
like
cola
with
roasted
malt
its
refreshing
to
have
a
beer
that
isnt
trying
to
knock
you
off
your
seat
but
that
doesnt
save
this
beer
if
i
were
to
have
this
on
cask
i
think
i
might
like
this
a
little
more
it
just
tasted
watered
down
unlikely
to
get
this
again
taste
is
pleasant
and
it
fits
the
bill
as
an
export
stout
upon
first
tasting
right
in
the
middle
of
an
imperial
and
a
regular
stout
there
is
plenty
of
chocolaty
sweetness
with
a
fair
amount
of
roast
and
alcohol
mild
fruit
contributes
more
of
a
complexity
aspect
than
a
straight
up
fruit
flavor
carbonation
level
is
a
bit
high
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
but
i
am
liking
this
slightly
aged
version
better
than
the
fresh
one
i
had
a
year
and
a
half
ago
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
wet
and
lingers
on
far
too
long
in
a
licorice
type
of
profile
some
sourness
comes
out
upon
warming
and
is
distracting
there
is
plenty
not
to
like
here
there
are
much
better
export
stout
style
beers
out
there
see
buried
hatchet
and
left
hand
ftb
1
i
will
pass
in
the
future
but
will
not
keep
me
from
at
least
trying
some
more
ridgeway
brews
in
the
future
chocolate
character
left
lingering
in
the
mouth
overall
it
was
decent
but
not
something
to
please
dark
stout
lovers
as
the
label
might
lend
you
to
believe
dark
dark
amber
i
can
see
where
it
gets
its
name
the
smell
is
nice
rich
with
dark
malts
taste
is
not
so
great
its
lighter
than
i
hoped
but
it
does
have
some
chocolate
coffee
and
toffee
type
flavors
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
bit
metallic
not
sure
if
my
bottle
was
contaminated
but
it
did
taste
a
little
more
metallic
than
any
beer
ive
ever
had
it
is
a
really
smooth
beer
and
easy
to
drink
although
that
metal
taste
i
mentioned
will
prevent
me
from
buying
this
again
this
would
rate
better
as
a
brown
ale
or
porter
than
a
stout
the
lump
of
coal
is
a
nice
concept
but
oversells
this
beer
d
its
almost
a
month
past
christmas
and
i
didnt
get
a
stocking
but
if
i
did
this
wouldnt
have
been
a
bad
stuffer
possibly
the
biggest
english
stout
ive
had
and
by
that
i
mean
considerable
alcohol
content
and
body
but
with
flavor
and
aroma
that
are
par
for
the
course
i
wouldnt
call
it
close
to
imperial
but
it
definitely
packs
a
boozy
kick
that
is
warming
to
say
the
least
one
and
done
for
me
ive
been
a
bad
elf
this
year
d
very
good
and
very
easy
to
drink
its
a
shame
i
didnt
get
more
d
on
the
lighter
side
making
it
quite
drinkable
the
body
is
lighter
tahn
expected
and
really
pleasant
another
one
please
and
some
christmas
pudding
notes
the
weakest
of
the
4
ridgeway
brewing
company
beers
that
i
tasted
and
rated
this
week
it
has
a
very
malty
taste
heavy
fullbodied
alcoholly
very
smooth
with
little
spice
for
a
holiday
beer
excellent
stout
but
if
you
are
expecting
a
spicy
winter
warmer
this
isnt
it
initially
i
didnt
notice
a
particularly
striking
attribute
or
character
but
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
it
grows
on
me
it
isnt
a
beer
id
normally
make
a
reach
for
but
it
has
more
in
the
way
of
unique
quality
the
more
i
drink
it
overall
this
was
a
lump
of
coal
i
guess
you
got
to
give
them
credit
for
letting
you
know
ahead
of
time
im
glad
this
was
a
gift
because
id
never
spend
money
on
it
shame
on
shelton
for
bringing
in
this
crap
from
a
subpar
brewer
d
not
a
terrible
beer
just
not
nearly
as
good
as
other
quality
stouts
drinkable
but
not
what
i
was
lookinghoping
for
just
soso
eh
d
i
found
this
beer
to
be
ok
but
not
great
there
are
better
export
stouts
out
there
in
my
opinion
im
still
glad
i
got
try
it
d
this
beer
was
a
gift
on
christmas
and
this
beer
is
an
easy
drink
and
had
some
good
flavor
to
go
along
with
to
bad
a
certain
beer
show
host
had
to
ruin
the
shape
of
the
bottle
for
me
drinkable
stout
well
made
clean
taste
almost
uneventful
but
still
enjoyable
drinkability
i
couldnt
really
see
having
more
than
one
bottle
but
it
does
make
an
awesome
christmas
gift
my
brotherinlaw
gave
me
a
bottle
of
this
for
christmas
pours
a
very
dark
reddishbrown
thin
offwhite
head
smells
of
mostly
of
roasted
grains
more
like
a
scottish
ale
tastes
much
the
same
dark
roasty
flavors
a
little
too
loose
of
a
mouthfeel
for
a
stout
too
watery
very
drinkable
flavorful
beer
but
not
quite
a
stout
d
an
ok
holiday
stout
nothing
too
exceptional
i
think
this
would
fair
much
better
with
a
plate
of
holiday
turkey
and
taters
than
alone
pours
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
on
the
edges
it
has
a
khaki
colored
head
with
fine
creamy
looking
bubbles
looks
like
a
typical
stout
deep
dark
and
delicious
it
gives
off
a
strong
roasted
malt
smell
some
dark
fruit
as
well
as
floral
tones
and
a
hint
of
licorice
the
taste
is
pretty
light
a
bit
watery
it
has
a
strong
roasty
presence
with
toffee
notes
dark
chocolate
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
coffee
on
the
back
with
a
touch
of
alcoholic
heat
that
numbs
the
palate
just
a
bit
as
it
warms
more
specific
notes
of
plum
and
prune
as
well
as
fresh
tobacco
show
up
the
flavor
progression
i
found
went
from
roasty
malt
to
dark
fruit
then
to
a
cocoabitter
chocolate
finish
this
stout
has
a
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
pretty
crisp
and
makes
for
a
good
distinguished
and
creamy
stout
drinkability
it
was
pretty
good
i
liked
it
but
it
was
lighter
than
most
stouts
that
i
have
had
i
would
drink
it
again
as
i
poured
it
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
color
was
a
rich
syrupy
gold
as
the
glass
filled
the
reddish
gold
color
turned
black
it
smelled
sweet
an
alcoholic
the
taste
was
clean
sweet
and
bitter
and
it
had
a
definite
taste
of
alcohol
though
it
had
a
thick
texture
its
after
taste
was
subtle
and
clean
it
went
well
with
my
meal
but
would
have
also
been
good
alone
drinkability
went
very
well
with
a
heavy
meal
and
quite
appropriate
for
a
holiday
meal
i
couldnt
have
another
one
but
good
to
have
and
try
out
not
exactly
a
stout
as
im
used
to
but
is
really
an
english
ale
and
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
d
theres
not
that
much
to
this
one
which
aids
in
the
drinkability
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
just
not
very
complex
of
flavorful
nothing
real
special
about
this
one
other
than
the
name
and
label
jonathan
passow
overall
a
forgettable
holiday
stout
with
no
holiday
character
overall
nothing
special
your
typical
english
stout
lacking
assertivness
flavor
and
direction
d
while
its
not
quite
what
youd
expect
from
the
label
the
overall
profile
is
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
their
presentation
of
8
abv
is
not
terribly
subtle
but
on
a
day
like
today
12
of
snow
you
wouldnt
want
it
to
be
high
drinkability
good
stuff
overall
a
bit
underrated
d
this
is
actually
a
pretty
pleasant
drinking
beer
for
the
abv
at
this
strength
drinkability
is
well
above
average
very
nearly
comes
off
as
sessionable
in
that
its
a
tasty
beer
yet
not
too
harsh
nor
does
it
force
you
to
think
too
hard
while
drinking
it
of
course
the
8
will
claim
you
if
you
try
but
it
feels
like
something
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
without
much
of
a
problem
seems
to
me
a
little
underrated
at
b
hardly
a
bad
beer
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
stout
however
the
flavors
really
didnt
make
any
kind
of
impact
rather
they
were
just
there
not
one
to
avoid
but
not
one
to
seek
out
all
in
all
this
brew
is
not
recommended
ridgeway
has
other
brews
that
are
more
worth
your
money
should
not
be
classified
in
the
stout
style
because
it
cannot
compete
with
brews
in
the
same
style
fyi
i
am
a
porter
and
stout
lover
and
this
offering
missed
the
style
by
a
mile
overall
not
the
stout
for
me
i
just
wasnt
a
fan
of
the
english
parts
of
this
beer
it
had
some
nice
toffee
notes
but
i
gotta
pass
on
this
one
this
is
one
hell
of
a
drinker
as
far
as
stouts
go
a
refreshing
crispness
complements
the
deliciously
malty
flavors
dark
bodied
stout
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
toward
the
light
mocha
tan
head
swells
leaving
behind
even
thin
bands
of
lacing
aroma
dark
fruit
and
dark
roasted
malts
very
bitter
root
like
notes
with
fruit
sweetness
in
the
edges
a
bit
of
booze
comes
off
in
the
nose
as
well
flavor
is
creamy
with
dark
chocolate
and
some
packed
in
fruit
notes
mainly
a
touch
of
yogurt
tartness
and
plum
or
raisin
pudding
the
mild
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
roasts
reign
supreme
bringing
out
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
lightly
carbonated
milky
feel
to
it
overall
drinkability
is
decent
but
definitely
not
a
beer
to
give
up
on
american
crafts
for
d
it
was
fun
to
try
but
i
dont
think
i
could
have
more
than
one
in
a
given
holiday
season
this
was
a
really
good
treat
and
im
glad
i
tryed
it
however
with
a
6
pricetag
for
a
pint
plus
i
can
get
more
for
my
buck
elsewhere
salud
great
fireplace
beer
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
the
body
seems
a
bit
thin
but
otherwise
a
nice
beer
poured
a
dark
redbrown
with
a
respectable
head
that
reduced
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
sweet
like
maple
syrup
the
taste
was
chocolate
maple
and
some
coffee
the
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
reasonable
good
as
export
stouts
go
this
was
a
little
above
average
overall
a
delicious
beer
but
not
incredibly
complex
it
also
should
be
mentioned
that
they
cover
up
the
8
very
well
aroma
is
there
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
chocolate
covered
cherries
comes
to
mind
with
the
aroma
flavor
is
not
heavily
roasted
but
more
of
a
sour
stout
moutfeel
is
weak
for
a
stout
but
it
all
works
together
ok
as
a
stout
not
a
home
run
but
as
a
winter
warmer
this
might
get
higher
ratings
trying
to
rate
it
as
a
stout
drinkability
this
beer
is
not
one
youd
reach
for
more
of
one
of
because
th
finish
is
so
weak
and
alcohol
is
so
high
but
the
8
percent
is
extremely
hidden
so
for
some
it
would
be
drinkable
for
its
very
fast
effective
buzz
butt
overall
for
a
stout
this
just
is
not
that
good
at
all
taste
is
on
the
bitter
side
unsweetened
chocolate
espresso
sour
malt
a
little
licorice
and
few
hops
ends
a
little
dry
and
somewhat
bitter
d
moderate
the
high
abv
keeps
this
in
check
d
quite
drinkable
would
be
nice
with
food
or
a
dessert
i
have
to
say
ive
sampled
several
offerings
from
this
brewery
now
and
im
not
really
that
impressed
with
any
of
them
not
worth
the
hype
the
local
distributors
keep
pushing
this
is
a
really
good
stout
much
better
than
most
stouts
but
some
like
guiness
can
give
it
a
run
for
its
money
still
its
unique
and
worthy
in
its
own
merit
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
in
a
session
this
is
a
good
beer
one
thats
certainly
worth
the
5
00
i
paid
for
the
25
ounce
bomber
dans
liquor
in
plover
wisconsin
is
the
joint
where
i
picked
up
this
carbon
d
pretty
highly
drinkable
because
the
8
is
nowhere
to
be
found
and
the
thin
mouthfeel
lends
this
to
be
drank
and
drank
d
if
i
was
sharing
the
bottle
with
friends
or
family
i
could
have
another
glass
since
i
am
forced
to
have
the
bottle
to
myself
one
is
enough
for
me
at
a
single
seating
body
is
a
smoothened
delight
of
a
simple
creamy
stoutesk
mode
a
bit
light
yet
firm
soft
and
supple
in
its
tang
and
carbonation
for
a
stout
it
could
use
more
boldness
and
thickness
its
not
completely
empty
it
actually
carries
a
decent
tone
and
character
thats
kind
of
charming
and
easy
to
take
making
for
a
good
drinking
stout
the
8
isnt
evident
anywhere
although
after
a
couple
or
more
it
may
catch
ya
by
surprise
this
is
one
lump
of
coal
i
would
be
happy
with
finding
in
my
stocking
feel
and
drinkability
incredibly
smooth
body
carbonation
is
low
with
tiny
delicate
bubbles
body
is
mediumheavy
this
is
one
that
i
really
enjoy
drinking
feel
is
great
and
it
really
works
for
this
beer
everything
is
working
together
real
nicely
as
i
already
mentioned
this
is
one
that
ill
drink
again
a
very
nice
beer
give
this
one
a
go
round
if
youve
not
had
it
tis
the
season
and
the
only
time
of
the
year
that
its
available
here
greater
cincy
area
nikki
notes
overall
a
good
stout
if
not
terribly
impressive
still
the
rarity
of
the
style
at
least
around
here
means
that
this
one
would
be
welcome
back
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
buy
it
by
itself

mildly
sweet
taste
of
roasted

and
faint

some
drying
hops
in
the
finish
good
solid
boozy
british
stout
i
like
it
recommended
to
wallow
away
the
holidays
or
any
day
good
stuff
a
very
light
and
thin
stout
and
more
of
a
fruity
winter
ale
nothing
special
in
my
book
d
the
8
abv
is
well
concealed
so
i
must
admit
this
would
be
fine
as
a
dessert
beverage
perhaps
paired
with
a
decent
cigar
pitch
black
in
color
it
pours
a
sandy
tan
head
there
is
little
to
no
lacing
and
the
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
one
of
roasted
malts
with
a
bit
of
vanilla
i
enjoyed
the
rich
chocolate
notes
and
this
is
followed
up
by
sweet
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
and
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
all
in
all
a
solid
stout
that
would
pair
will
with
a
variety
of
deserts
like
some
of
my
other
reviews
this
was
taken
from
my
notes
and
is
from
winter
2007
i
definitely
need
to
retry
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
light
good
sized
mocha
head
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
leaving
some
lace
on
the
way
down
smells
of
milk
chocolate
a
little
roast
some
bread
maybe
some
licorice
tastes
like
it
smells
chocolate
bread
maybe
a
bit
of
molasses
and
hops
in
there
too
oilycreamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
medium
to
high
carbonation
really
kind
of
unremarkable
tasted
more
like
a
brown
or
a
porter
than
a
stout
i
though
the
body
was
a
bit
light
for
the
style
and
it
lacked
enough
roasted
malt
flavor
and
aroma
the
taste
was
actually
very
flavorful
just
not
the
beer
i
thought
i
purchased
d
id
definitely
have
another
if
offered
but
i
have
other
stouts
i
trust
more
so
this
will
get
skipped
on
a
shopping
trip
clever
label
mediocre
beer
a
50dc
bottle
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
the
beer
was
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
it
had
a
mediumsized
tan
head
that
disappeared
quickly
roasted
malt
and
faint
chocolate
aroma
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
teeny
bit
of
hops
the
beer
seemed
to
be
pretty
watery
and
i
dont
think
ill
have
it
again
this
poured
an
opaque
cherry
wood
color
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
milk
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
with
some
nuttiness
and
copper
hops
it
tasted
like
milk
chocolate
and
barley
and
coffee
malts
with
some
copper
hops
as
it
warmed
it
gained
hints
of
licorice
and
molasses
it
was
fairly
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
mostly
bitter
but
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
solid
british
stout
although
another
ridgeway
beer
with
nothing
to
make
it
especially
christmas
regardless
it
had
good
flavor
and
good
body
it
was
easy
to
drink
surprisingly
easy
as
i
thought
it
was
6
abv
until
i
looked
it
up
and
realized
its
actually
8
the
alcohol
was
definitely
well
hidden
otherwise
there
was
nothing
fancy
about
this
beer
but
it
was
well
refined
and
enjoyable
overall
this
beer
missed
the
mark
as
an
export
stout
it
lacked
the
head
retention
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
the
stout
the
beer
taste
overtly
sweet
guinness
is
better
export
stout
i
had
one
in
the
shannon
ireland
airport
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
the
finish
is
sweet
this
beer
could
be
more
like
a
sweet
stout
instead
of
an
export
stout
overall
the
beer
is
good
and
easy
to
drink
except
it
missed
the
mark
on
a
few
areas
another
below
average
beer
from
ridgeway
good
marketing
but
sub
par
brewing
pours
a
dark
brown
not
much
of
a
head
the
nose
has
dark
malts
and
fruits
the
taste
is
fairly
uncomplex
a
good
amount
of
roasty
malts
and
subtle
hops
medium
body
pairs
well
with
a
greasy
meal
many
better
stouts
out
there
for
the
drinking
future
outlook
a
bit
of
a
weird
one
never
really
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
real
stout
not
a
terrible
brew
by
any
stretch
but
not
one
i
would
feel
compelled
to
revisit
and
certainly
not
what
i
was
expecting
out
of
a
dark
holiday
stout
roasty
and
chocolatey
on
the
palate
watery
thin
body
low
carbonation
and
somewhat
tart
finish
disappointing
easy
to
drink
i
suppose
but
not
because
of
the
flavors
pours
deep
and
dark
almost
black
with
ruby
hilights
when
held
to
the
light
short
tan
head
of
foamy
bubbles
that
form
a
solid
floating
cap
smell
is
mildly
sweet
roasted
malty
lighlty
toasty
grains
a
bit
fruity
body
is
slightly
thin
and
one
dimensional
8
alcohol
is
well
hidden
ok
as
a
regular
dry
stout
but
needs
alot
more
aroma
flavor
body
to
judged
against
other
foreign
high
alcohol
stouts
again
slightly
dissapointing
found
this
in
my
stocking
christmas
morning
poured
into
a
pint
glass
black
in
the
glass
with
hints
of
mahogany
when
held
to
the
light
poured
with
a
roughly
quarterinch
tan
head
aroma
and
taste
are
reminiscent
of
dark
chocolate
not
too
bitter
with
a
nice
mouthfeel
this
is
a
stout
id
drink
again
spicey
stout
and
i
like
the
style
pours
dark
with
amber
highlights
burnt
aroma
lacey
oh
and
some
bittersweet
chocolate
there
is
a
spot
of
smoke
in
here
and
the
spiciness
though
the
coffee
throws
me
a
bit
off
decent
drinkable
fine
british
beer
and
beat
my
expectations
overall
decent
stout
pretty
typical
of
the
style
but
certainly
worth
the
quaff
very
dark
in
color
but
not
quite
blackruby
black
small
tight

head
on

rather
bland

metallic
and
burnt
faint

mild
port
flavor
slightly
oak
like
a
tad
fruity
the
roasted
flavor
is
very
faint
has
a
sort
of
homebrew
inky
flavor
ok
bodycould
use
some
beefing
up
enjoyable
enough
but
i
was
expecting
something
more
especially
at
8
kind
of
thin
but
relatively
drinkable
for
8
a
fun
holiday
buy
and
would
be
a
great
gift
for
christmas
pours
black
with
an
acceptable
tan
head
and
moderate
lacing
that
tends
to
fade
roasted
sweet
chococate
nose
that
is
the
beers
selling
point
good
thickness
on
first
taste
but
could
use
a
bigger
flavor
just
not
enough
roast
hit
my
taste
buds
to
back
up
the
aroma
as
the
beer
warmed
the
aroma
lost
some
of
its
toastiness
and
left
behind
only
the
sweet
chocolate
finishes
adequately
with
a
slight
hint
at
the
abv
but
left
me
wanting
for
more
in
its
taste
serving
type
bottle
yowza
that
is
one
sweet
beer
unfortunately
thats
not
a
compliment
its
cloying
and
syrupy
it
tastes
like
someone
dumped
a
load
of
sugar
into
the
wort
or
whatever
the
right
term
is
i
really
need
to
start
home
brewing
so
i
dont
sound
like
a
moron
on
here
i
like
a
big
sweet
malty
english
beer
but
this
tastes
more
like
a
werthers
orignal
than
delicious
malted
barley
the
color
is
a
very
very
dark
amber
with
a
good
head
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
malty
a
tiny
bit
spicy
and
slightly
hoppy
the
flavor
is
much
too
sweet
its
malt
with
a
ton
of
sugar
thrown
on
top
chocolate
butterscotch
toffee
syrup
and
honey
dominate
the
flavor
profile
the
feel
is
syrupy
and
way
over
the
top
sweetness
i
could
not
finish
a
full
50cl
bottle
the
name
would
lose
its
intended
irony
for
me
if
i
were
receive
this
bottle
in
my
stocking
i
think
this
stout
is
wonderful
i
would
purchase
again
dont
let
other
bas
mislead
you
it
is
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
they
say
at
least
give
it
a
try
and
see
for
yourself
m
thin
and
watery
moderate
carbonation
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
how
it
looks
midnight
black
pour
with
a
shortlived
brown
head
it
goes
downhill
from
there
sour
fakemalt
aroma
with
dank
wood
and
grain
thin
watery
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
not
like
any
stout
i
have
ever
had
corn
grain
sour
hops
metal
and
burnt
malt
but
in
a
bad
way
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
a
jelly
belly
popcorn
aftertaste
seems
like
a
gimmick
name
for
a
bad
overpriced
beer
not
my
favorite
english
stout
and
kind
of
subpar
once
is
enough
for
me
with
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
but
thin
a
small
tan
head
that
fades
fast
with
no
lacing
smells
sweet
almost
like
a
milk
stout
drinks
the
same
way
a
nice
thin
and
smooth
mouthfeel
sweet
but
not
as
sweet
as
a
milk
stout
but
no
bitterness
at
all
all
in
all
it
was
a
good
beer
very
drinkable
i
could
have
another
dfair
drinkability
it
has
a
nice
hearty
flavor
that
feels
appropriate
for
a
nice
coldweather
christmas
gathering
not
as
deep
dark
and
foreboding
as
the
description
on
the
label
led
me
to
believe
but
still
an
enjoyable
brew
an
interesting
dark
brown
pour
pretty
translucent
light
can
permeate
this
it
is
definetely
not
black
smell
of
malt
and
raisin
very
malty
flavors
some
roast
toffee
and
mocha
medium
bodied
could
be
considered
slightly
creamy
as
it
warms
it
loses
its
creaminess
finish
a
little
tartcoffee
bitter
very
drinkable
with
8
abv
i
really
warming
up
to
this
style
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
it
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
malt
slight
harsh
alcohol
overtone
finishes
dry
and
chalky
tastes
heavy
on
belgian
sugar
nice
fireplace
brew
but
could
be
improved
upon
prosit
mk
drinkability
is
moderate
its
not
good
but
not
bad
either
its
certainly
drinkable
but
boring
and
uninspiring
this
is
a
one
time
purchase
for
me
d
the
alcohol
flavours
keep
this
one
a
sipper
for
me
and
it
has
a
nice
warming
effect
on
the
way
down
wouldnt
have
more
than
one
at
any
given
time
but
its
a
pretty
decent
brew
nonetheless
i
recommend
this
easy
to
drink
beverage
any
time
of
year
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
offering
heavy
wicked
heavy
its
a
sippah
d
not
a
bad
beer
drinkable
to
be
sure
but
not
something
to
get
overly
excited
about
worth
a
shot
drinks
alright
but
not
much
to
get
excited
about
here
give
it
a
shot
not
a
bad
stout
no
spices
on
the
palete
like
i
was
hoping
average
overall
overall
quite
good
worth
trying
out
even
if
there
are
plenty
of
great
alternatives
in
the
stout
category
pours
to
a
black
coallike
color
with
medium
thin
tan
head
that
lingers
awhile
and
leaves
okay
lacing
nose
is
malty
nuts
and
chocolate
and
the
mouthfeel
is
sojmewhat
sweet
but
also
slightly
biting
flavor
accentuates
the
nose
but
also
adds
a
hint
of
licorice
the
8
alcohol
never
made
its
way
into
the
nose
or
flavor
but
added
to
the
warming
finish
not
a
bad
beer
while
the
aroma
was
excellent
i
found
this
beer
to
be
lacking
in
both
flavor
and
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
rather
average
stout
at
6
a
bottle
i
would
not
buy
it
again
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
beer
subtle
and
reserved
a
lovely
bedtime
brew
which
is
exactly
the
point
for
which
this
beer
was
brewed
not
a
winner
d
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
once
i
got
into
it
id
buy
again
next
christmas
season
for
sure
pours

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
note
this
is
my
first
review
on
ba
so
in
the
future
i
will
try
to
be
more
technical
the
overall
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
the
abv
is
wellmasked
and
the
taste
is
not
bad
but
it
seems
like
the
entire
brew
is
an
epitome
of
a
weak
stout
the
aroma
and
taste
are
both
underwhelming
not
an
awful
brew
something
i
could
drink
now
and
then
but
nothing
that
will
perk
up
my
interest
if
i
see
it
in
the
future
low
burnt
molasses
smell
weird
and
abit
unappealing
solid
medium
head
abit
disappointing
in
the
taste
department
some
burnt
ash
flavours
for
8
well
masked
lacks
complexity
but
extremely
smooth
giggling
granny
lowest
rated
of
the
giftpack
this
is
a
decent
beer
in
the
winter
series
from
ridgeway
seems
thats
the
only
time
i
see
their
beers
are
around
christmas
and
every
year
i
see
more
and
more
again
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
theres
so
many
others
out
there
its
difficult
to
justify
picking
this
up
again
d
okay
beer
nothing
fantastic
might
try
it
again
mouthfeel
is
fairly
rich
and
full
for
a
stout
pleasant
and
a
good
choice
for
a
cold
winter
eve
d
good
taste
and
a
just
lively
enough
carbonation
keeps
this
one
going
down
easy
especially
as
a
dessert
beer
d
goes
down
smoothly
a
nice
sipper
to
quote
my
girlfriend
its
smooth
going
down
and
doesnt
bite
you
back
d
good
beer
this
is
a
descent
holiday
beer
surprised
it
hits
8
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
very
big
beer
still
not
too
bad
cheers
a
really
nice
english
christmas
strong
stout
poored
a
very
dark
color
with
a
tan
colored
head
that
lasted
about
half
the
glass
strong
smell
of
caramel
chocolate
malt
no
noticeable
hop
aroma
the
beer
had
a
well
rounded
stout
like
taste
but
was
a
little
to
sweet
for
me
the
8
alcohol
was
not
evident
up
front
made
me
wonder
if
it
was
8
need
to
drink
more
to
find
out
pours
a
very
dark
black
that
some
light
can
get
through
to
show
a
ruby
reflection
minimal
head
very
sweet
on
the
nose
and
definite
malt
influence
flavor
is
rich
and
beautiful
i
will
admit
that
off
such
a
hokey
label
it
kind
of
lowered
my
expectations
but
the
truth
lies
in
the
bottle
rich
and
chocolatelike
strong
but
somewhat
mild
at
the
same
time
but
still
bears
strong
stout
characteristics
more
even
and
smooth
than
i
would
have
expected
still
though
it
seems
to
drop
off
on
the
tail
end
in
a
way
that
i
really
dont
want
it
to
on
the
finish
you
get
a
slight
spicy
kick
feel
is
a
little
thin
but
still
good
highly
drinkable
d
overall
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
im
not
a
stout
freak
but
i
would
definitely
get
this
one
again
could
use
a
bit
more
hopping
but
overall
a
decent
beer
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
very
dark
brown
just
slight
of
black
but
had
reddish
undertones
head
was
a
chocolatey
brown
maybe
14
in
thick
aroma
was
at
times
alcoholystringently
and
other
times
had
a
slight
brown
sugar
sweetness
to
it
taste
had
hints
of
bitterness
but
also
had
touches
of
cherry
flavors
felt
outstanding
in
the
mouth
the
only
detraction
was
that
it
was
a
little
thin
had
slight
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
be
annoying
the
beer
was
very
drinkable
hid
the
abv
well
could
easily
drink
more
of
this
than
is
wise
this
was
a
gift
and
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
and
if
i
were
to
get
it
as
a
gift
again
i
would
be
okay
with
that
thanks
mike
got
a
bottle
of
this
in
a
variety
pack
for
christmas
it
pours
a
nice
jet
black
color
with
bits
of
brownred
shining
through
and
a
small
quickly
fading
tan
head
the
smell
of
it
was
pretty
sweet
and
fruity
for
a
stout
kind
of
like
cherries
but
with
some
coffee
chocoate
and
smoked
smells
backing
it
up
it
has
a
good
drinkable
taste
and
mouthfeel
overall
to
it
it
tastes
sweet
and
smokey
with
a
somewhat
dry
finish
and
little
to
know
hop
or
bitterness
i
like
this
brew
overall
and
would
enjoy
some
more
of
it
especially
around
the
cold
holiday
season
pours
and
looks
like
cocacola
with
a
decent
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
here
which
goes
along
with
the
soda
description
the
aroma
has
coffee
up
front
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
but
nothing
stands
out
too
much
there
is
a
nice
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
and
some
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
as
well
this
is
way
too
carbonated
for
a
stout
in
my
estimation
more
creaminess
would
be
welcomed
here
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
beer
there
is
some
good
sweetness
and
it
could
be
served
as
a
dessert
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
mild
recommendation
creamy
aftertaste
again
capuccino
and
dry
fruit
a
light
and
delicate
note
of
roast
in
the
back
not
my
favorite
but
not
bad
pretty
easy
to
drink
for
abv
not
as
rich
as
i
was
hoping
nor
as
i
mentioned
before
as
smoky
on
its
own
its
a
decent
brew
a
bit
gimmicky
as
intended
it
could
fit
the
lump
of
coal
theme
a
bit
better
it
could
be
richer
otherwise
its
a
decent
english
winter
brew
d
this
is
an
unusual
beer
that
defied
my
expectations
but
i
am
quite
pleased
with
it
overall
i
was
expecting
something
with
big
body
and
subdued
english
flavors
instead
i
got
subdued
body
and
big
almost
belgian
flavors
as
it
happens
i
am
a
fan
of
this
combination
and
while
it
misses
the
english
stout
style
in
some
ways
it
does
so
in
a
distinctly
enjoyable
fashion
drinkability
for
an
english
stout
i
really
thought
this
was
a
good
example
flavor
meld
was
good
and
well
as
the
overall
texture
im
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
even
though
the
5
price
tag
was
too
steep
d
i
like
most
stouts
but
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
not
that
it
isnt
drinkable
but
the
alcohol
overpowers
any
of
the
other
flavors
that
may
be
present
it
certainly
warms
you
up
well
and
would
make
a
solid
choice
after
spending
some
time
outside
in
the
cold
unfortunately
i
am
in
florida
pours
a
deep
amber
color
almost
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
faint
roasty
malt
in
the
taste
sweet
roasty
malt
and
a
somewhat
lactose
hint
for
this
stout
a
smooth
to
a
small
bitter
mouthfeel
a
lactose
sweet
malt
aftertaste
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
not
that
dark
for
a
stout
kind
of
feel
like
a
milk
stout
i
opened
this
beer
and
poured
it
i
smelled
the
classic
ridgeway
funkiness
and
noticed
that
it
poured
incredibly
thin
and
far
too
carbonated
the
taste
was
the
classic
ridgeway
funkiness
why
do
all
their
beers
taste
so
damn
identical
very
thin
for
a
stout
and
not
near
malty
or
even
hoppy
enough
waaay
too
thin
to
be
a
stout
goes
down
like
a
black
lager
the
drinkability
i
suppose
is
decent
but
i
really
dont
recommend
this
as
a
stout
drinkability
pretty
easy
drinking
but
thats
because
there
is
not
a
lot
here
i
expected
more
botterness
more
roasted
barley
more
something
i
could
see
this
being
a
smooth
aged
drink
with
some
of
the
rum
raisin
flavors
developing
drinkability
alcohol
content
is
too
high
imo
one
beer
is
ok
will
i
buy
another
probably
not
this
year
just
an
over
alcoholed
stout
that
is
rather
average
d
i
can
drink
it
but
bleh
this
is
one
lump
of
coal
i
didnt
deserve
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
stoutperhaps
a
good
introduction
to
the
big
boys
this
is
a
very
mediocre
beer
with
good
marketing
behind
it
there
are
far
better
holiday
brews
out
there
when
poured
the
color
a
medium
dark
brown
with
some
tan
foam
and
there
was
lace
on
the
side
of
my
glass
there
was
a
smell
of
sweet
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
molassis
was
evident
the
taste
was
more
complex
than
the
smell
roasted
malts
molassis
but
then
there
was
a
hint
of
coffee
chocolate
and
vanilla
nicely
put
together
just
a
touch
to
bitter
i
thought
the
flavor
got
even
better
as
the
stout
warmed
up
more
flavor
and
less
bitterness
the
lump
of
coal
was
similar
to
its
name
i
was
excited
to
buy
it
was
good
marketing
that
got
me
it
poured
a
dark
amber
no
foam
no
lacing
no
head
retention
i
tasted
toffee
and
chocolate
and
the
smell
was
roasted
in
the
mouth
is
was
pretty
flat
and
had
little
carbonation
this
was
the
first
try
with
this
style
but
it
didnt
do
much
for
me
not
my
favorite
stout
a
decent
one
that
has
a
cool
name
color
is
lighter
than
what
i
expected
for
a
stout
dark
rubybrown
and
almost
opaque
aroma
is
rich
and
smoky
with
coffee
and
molasses
undertones
flavor
is
not
as
strong
as
other
stouts
i
have
tried
but
still
pleasing
smoky
with
coffee
undertones
and
a
hint
of
molasses
finish
is
smooth
and
leaves
a
little
bitterness
but
the
pleasant
bitterness
of
hops
this
is
one
lump
of
coal
that
you
wont
mind
finding
in
your
holiday
stocking
a
little
bitter
aftertaste
on
the
finish
but
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
not
a
bad
holiday
stout
but
there
is
some
astringency
that
detracts
from
the
overall
quality
the
beer
is
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
tinny
some
malts
but
not
all
that
distinct
one
way
or
another
although
youll
get
some
cherry
aromas
as
the
beer
settles
the
beer
is
full
bodied
moderately
carbonated
with
plenty
of
warming
alcohol
notes
which
probably
need
to
be
hidden
a
bit
more
the
taste
is
strong
sweet
toasted
malts
maybe
some
burnt
charcoallike
flavors
as
well
there
is
the
astringency
which
isnt
all
that
pleasing
and
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
buttery
the
beer
is
not
bad
certainly
apropos
for
the
cold
nights
of
winter
but
this
isnt
my
favorite
stout
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
metalic
and
there
is
a
bit
too
much
alcohol
on
the
tail
end
for
my
liking
so
far
this
ridgeway
brew
is
the
redeeming
one
of
the
bunch
i
will
buy
it
again
probably
before
christmas
and
maybe
even
give
some
friends
a
lump
of
coal
for
the
holiday
d
this
was
a
pretty
descent
stout
i
really
expected
more
it
just
didnt
overwhelm
me
with
flavor
i
poured
this
disappointing
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
black
and
poured
a
big
tan
fine
bubbly
head
it
was
bready
smelling
and
did
not
smell
like
a
stout
did
not
taste
like
one
either
acrid
aftertaste
mettalic
and
nothing
but
alcohol
left
on
the
palate
the
beer
did
have
good
lacing
for
whatever
good
that
does
ya
not
very
stoutish
in
my
opinion
i
will
not
buy
this
expensive
beer
again
this
is
certainly
a
stout
for
malt
lovers
it
focuses
on
the
malts
but
its
also
somewhat
complex
with
chocolate
tones
mixed
in
with
the
bitter
notes
recommended
i
finally
found
an
enjoyable
brew
in
this
lot
of
british
holiday
brews
the
dominant
flavors
here
definitely
evoke
thoughts
of
fruit
this
is
derived
from
the
mix
of
tart
notes
light
sweetness
and
concentrated
malt
flavors
perhaps
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
certainly
a
beer
that
is
an
enjoyable
sipper
for
this
particular
evening
i
could
ask
for
a
touch
more
richness
of
flavor
and
body
though
the
appearance
a
deep
brown
to
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
edges
the
head
about
an
inch
or
so
creamy
light
brown
after
its
rather
quick
demise
the
lacing
covers
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
roasted
grain
aroma
sweet
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
pleasantly
spicy
start
has
a
rich
malt
sweetness
and
the
taste
of
burnt
toast
quite
evident
top
is
medium
to
full
in
feel
finish
has
a
pleasantly
mild
acidity
the
hops
personable
sweet
burnt
toast
aftertaste
clings
to
the
palate
a
nice
stout
and
one
that
suits
the
style
in
my
humble
opinion
decent
stout
but
not
anything
spectacular
or
even
particularly
holiday
like
about
this
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
you
guessed
it
coalblack
with
a
minimal
mediumcolored
tan
head
the
smell
is
roasted
caramel
and
plums
seems
appropriately
christmasy
the
taste
is
surprisingly
dry
with
roasted
coffee
and
nuts
dominating
the
aftertaste
is
like
you
just
had
a
pint
of
espresso
all
coffee
all
day
the
mouthfeel
is
silky
surprisingly
thinner
than
i
would
expect
for
a
stout
closer
to
a
porter
really
the
drinkability
is
good
although
the
dry
finish
limits
it
if
you
like
imperial
stouts
or
milk
stouts
this
one
is
not
a
bad
one
to
try
probably
best
to
just
let
one
of
your
i
know
he
likes
beer
so
relatives
give
this
to
you
in
the
gift
pack
though
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
on
its
own
merits
beer
poured
black
with
ruby
undertones
when
held
up
to
daylight
tan
head
never
really
developed
nose
is
of
sweet
malts
and
a
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
of
toasted
chocolate
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
balanced
by
a
dry
bittering
hop
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
the
style
and
lacks
the
creamy
quality
that
are
in
most
high
abv
stouts
drinkability
is
ok
the
beer
has
mellowed
a
bit
over
the
last
three
plus
months
the
first
time
i
had
this
the
alcohol
was
very
up
front
with
each
sip
this
is
worthy
of
a
shot
update
i
retried
this
holiday
beer
the
day
before
thanksgiving
2009
and
its
just
as
i
remembered
it
from
my
notes
i
got
a
little
better
aroma
from
the
glass
this
time
around
so
upped
my
smell
rating
half
a
point
but
otherwise
this
was
right
on
drinkable
as
in
yes
you
can
drink
it
but
with
as
little
flavor
as
this
has
why
would
i
ever
pick
this
over
a
regular
guinness
unremarkable
in
all
respects
black
body
with
some
ruby
red
highlights
some
spotty
lace
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
licorice
in
the
nose
tasty
beer
but
not
really
stout
like
good
malts
but
not
much
bitterness
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
for
the
style
i
think
and
in
many
ways
this
isnt
really
very
stout
like
quite
sweet
with
a
little
alcohol
in
the
background
of
the
finish
drinkability
below
average
one
and
done
i
was
glad
to
finish
this
beer
off
not
to
mention
an
above
average
price
makes
this
beer
less
palatable
the
name
label
8
etc
etc
combine
to
create
an
image
of
a
beer
that
imo
this
is
definitely
not
too
bad
congrats
your
advertising
made
my
friend
buy
your
beer
but
instead
of
a
dark
holiday
stout
it
reminds
me
of
a
better
than
average
hearty
porter
nice
gift
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
overall
impression
its
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
i
just
cant
seem
to
get
any
firm
flavors
out
of
it
a
nice
stout
in
all
categories
particularly
in
taste
in
which
the
heavy
roasted
flavors
of
most
stouts
are
turned
down
a
bit
and
replaced
with
some
notable
dark
fruit
flavors
a
very
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
hiding
the
8
abv
very
nicely
warming
and
inviting
very
nice
for
a
winter
evening
its
a
stout
and
as
black
in
appearance
as
any
other
poured
from
a
bottle
which
perfectly
fills
my
imperial
pint
glass
it
has
a
modest
head
lace
adorns
the
glass
in
a
web
like
quilt
pattern
and
fades
away
hints
of
licorice
in
the
finish
coffee
hazelnut
some
fruitiness
like
berries
in
the
background
as
you
drink
further
chewy
biscuity
viscous
mouthfeel
nice
yet
light
carbonation
its
very
difficult
to
detect
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
again
hints
of
coffee
but
thats
about
it
i
like
the
8
abv
ballsy
for
a
stout
you
can
drink
more
than
a
few
in
one
sitting
would
love
to
get
ahold
of
one
on
tap
humorous
name
and
description
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
worth
the
price
pours
black
with
a
tan
fluffy
head
smelled
of
raisins
chocolate
and
some
fruitiness
had
some
yeastiness
breadlike
aromas
thought
it
was
lacking
roasted
aromas
compared
to
other
stouts
taste
was
okay
mostly
bitter
chocolate
with
some
mild
sweetness
mediumbodied
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
really
make
me
want
to
grab
another
not
very
interesting
the
lack
of
roasted
flavors
is
kind
of
a
downer
for
me
on
this
one
received
this
for
a
present
from
a
friend
chilled
and
poured
into
a
nonic
the
head
lingers
about
a
centimeter
above
the
surface
its
sort
of
a
chocolate
milk
shake
color
and
slight
lacing
the
body
seems
opaque
with
small
hints
of
ruby
smells
of
rum
raisins
light
chocolate
toasted
malt
hints
of
vanilla
coffee
and
maybe
a
tinge
of
smokiness
taste
starts
with
a
round
dark
malt
and
shapes
into
the
chocolate
character
which
comes
toward
the
end
of
the
midsections
the
hops
only
really
manifest
themselves
in
a
mild
bitterness
that
helps
to
balance
the
more
robust
character
of
this
drink
funny
enough
something
about
the
flavor
of
this
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
coke
soda
the
mouthfeel
on
this
is
a
bit
on
the
lighter
side
rather
clean
and
with
a
dry
finish
honestly
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
that
interesting
it
has
lots
of
elements
that
at
first
get
you
interested
and
then
sort
of
dont
quite
achieve
what
youd
hoped
they
would
yet
sill
worth
a
try
what
a
difference
a
day
makes
this
is
why
you
should
taste
twice
review
once
i
was
ready
to
crucify
this
beer
last
night
i
hated
it
but
a
fresher
palette
an
appropriate
glass
and
a
bit
closer
to
room
temperature
and
presto
coal
turns
to
gold
medium
body
low
carbonation
balance
seems
reasonable
alcohol
is
hidden
well
in
the
flavor
aroma
warming
effect
does
slowly
work
its
way
into
the
picture
could
be
better
could
be
worse
drinkable
but
not
terribly
compelling
pours
a
deep
brown
leather
with
a
light
sandpaper
head
the
raosm
is
of
roast
and
slightly
astringent
cream
but
no
alcohol
this
is
the
strongest
english
stout
ive
ever
had
the
flavos
carries
some
good
roasted
mlats
character
with
hints
of
bananas
and
some
creamed
coffee
from
speedway
the
palate
is
very
smooth
and
meidum
the
alcohol
is
covered
up
very
well
drink
more
than
a
few
this
beer
just
reminds
more
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
not
a
bad
beer
nothing
to
get
excited
about
though
drinkability
a
very
nice
stout
the
only
thing
that
makes
it
holiday
like
imo
is
the
warming
strenghth
very
pleasant
roasty
chocolatey
and
sweet
flavors
that
are
kept
in
a
great
creamy
balance
taste
consists
of
the
dark
fruit
some
spiciness
ample
malt
and
a
quick
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
i
expect
for
the
style
drinkability
was
decent
but
one
bottle
was
enough
for
me
i
received
this
beer
as
a
gift
and
will
probably
not
seek
it
out
it
is
certainly
drinkable
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
id
rather
have
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
a
small
tan
head
not
much
read
retention
or
lacing
it
smells
like
bittersweet
chocolate
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malt
it
tastes
the
same
way
to
me
but
the
beer
has
a
bitter
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
its
closer
to
being
watery
than
it
is
to
being
creamy
drinkability
is
ok
it
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
not
a
great
beer
but
its
drinkable
id
have
one
of
these
again
unfamiliar
with
the
style
might
find
pleasant
based
on
the
2
ive
tried
so
far
i
can
see
purchasing
this
foursome
lump
of
coal
bad
elf
rudolphs
revenge
and
santas
butt
again
next
year
and
the
year
after
etc
these
are
fun
tasty
holiday
treats
lump
of
coal
appropriately
enough
pours
a
virtually
black
color
with
only
a
hint
of
ruby
highlights
on
the
edges
and
a
thin
tan
head
from
a
brown
500
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
mild
and
malty
there
are
some
nice
chocolate
notes
in
the
flavor
this
beer
is
kind
of
esthery
and
the
alcohol
is
definitely
noticeable
worth
a
try
cheers
for
any
fan
of
british
ales
this
is
a
musttry
for
fans
of
porter
or
stout
dont
miss
this
and
for
your
everyday
average
beer
lovers
in
general
what
a
charm
this
is
this
is
a
nice
stout
holiday
stout
or
whateverstyleof
stout
it
is
id
revisit
this
one
appears
as
the
same
suggests
dark
like
coal
though
light
enough
to
see
some
dark
red
hues
little
head
smells
of
smokey
malt
tastes
of
dark
malts
with
some
hoppy
dryness
not
a
watery
beer
but
not
as
creamy
as
many
other
stouts
very
drinkable
though
kinda
expensive
worth
grabbing
a
christmas
variety
pack
during
the
holidays
though
for
a
lump
of
coal
not
very
drinkable
when
cold
there
was
no
flavor
once
it
was
warmed
up
the
flavors
intensified
but
so
did
the
bitterness
and
dry
finish
this
beer
is
not
worth
5
however
this
beer
was
a
little
bit
better
than
i
was
expecting
because
i
think
this
beer
was
created
as
a
joke
and
as
a
joke
it
works
quite
well
know
someone
that
likes
beer
but
you
want
to
poke
fun
at
lump
of
coal
much
more
than
you
deserve
for
xmas
this
year
i
got
one
for
my
fatherinlaw
nothing
too
remarkable
here
its
a
smooth
drinker
and
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
it
its
just
mild
and
kind
of
boring
and
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
rather
pricy
holiday
stout
also
it
seemed
rather
thin
for
the
style
but
that
could
be
partly
due
to
a
lack
of
carbonation
a
nice
drinkable
holiday
stout
taste
more
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
some
coffee
tones
come
through
but
not
very
strong
sticky
sweet
and
the
dry
hops
finish
it
off
pretty
well
it
became
a
better
brew
once
it
warmed
up
easy
drinking
can
use
another
one
drinkability
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
how
well
it
hides
its
alcohol
with
the
relatively
clean
taste
this
is
any
easy
beer
to
drink
pours
nearly
black
darkbrown
with
red
edges
forms
a
miniscule
head
that
rapidly
dissolves
to
thin
lace
doesnt
smell
like
very
much
when
poured
at
cellar
temperature
fleeting
powdered
cocoa
alcohol
and
darktoasted
malts
tastes
somewhat
better
than
that
theres
little
initial
flavor
but
the
center
develops
dark
fruits
and
toasted
malt
heft
the
finish
becomes
powdery
and
dry
with
chocolate
and
bitter
medicinal
alcohol
a
rich
and
creamy
sipping
beer
in
the
mouth
the
beer
becomes
unexpectedly
heady
over
time
warming
but
not
especially
good
overall
theres
enough
complexity
to
keep
this
intriguing
for
a
holiday
warmer
but
its
not
weird
or
overly
spicy
it
definitely
should
be
warmed
just
a
bit
before
serving
to
bringout
some
of
this
complexity
i
wish
i
had
a
bit
of
cheesecake
or
some
chocolate
covered
fruit
to
bringout
the
flavors
in
different
ways
its
hard
to
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
thats
really
not
necessary
anyway
for
an
8
a
b
v
brew
anyway
very
dark
though
enough
light
gets
through
to
reveal
some
crimson
highlights
around
the
edges
the
coppery
head
is
fine
but
lacking
in
both
quantity
and
staying
power
nose
is
pleasantly
malted
with
only
hints
of
roasty
smokiness
the
strongest
point
of
this
stout
is
its
taste
with
semidark
malts
ruling
the
day
but
some
dryness
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
good
toonot
as
fullcreamychewy
as
many
stouts
but
not
at
all
watery
this
was
nice
and
went
down
very
easily
drinkability
really
pretty
poor
with
some
serious
off
flavors
pours
almost
black
with
garnett
highlights
light
tan
head
which
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
aroma
is
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
initially
chocolates
then
roasted
malts
fruitiness
in
the
finish
seems
medium
bodied
lighter
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
ill
probably
get
this
again
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
sticky
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
faint
with
some
nice
notes
of
sweet
chocolate
and
coffee
i
was
surprised
by
the
taste
after
the
faint
aroma
the
flavor
is
really
nice
and
roasted
dark
malts
with
some
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
overall
while
this
is
a
far
stretch
from
being
an
excellent
beer
it
is
certainly
a
decent
one
this
is
really
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
especially
considering
the
high
pricetag
of
5
85
for
the
bottle
a
fitting
name
for
a
beer
that
opens
with
a
distinct
charcoal
aroma
from
roasted
dark
grains
though
these
aromas
dominate
there
is
a
schwarzbier
malt
ferment
and
hop
character
to
back
it
up
looks
opaque
black
and
viscous
flavors
are
again
dominated
by
black
roasted
malts
with
a
follow
up
of
toasted
malts
light
cocoa
and
light
coffee
an
underlying
sweetness
boarders
on
lactose
and
or
oats
accompanying
this
sweetness
is
a
velvety
almost
oily
texture
that
mellows
the
beer
and
rounds
off
the
rough
alcohol
edges
well
melded
and
easy
to
drink
for
such
strong
flavors
this
stout
poured
black
as
coal
with
sudsy
brown
foam
that
settled
fairly
quickly
the
smell
was
dark
roasted
malt
and
barley
with
a
hint
off
sweetness
the
taste
was
richly
malty
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
there
was
modest
hoppiness
overall
it
was
a
bit
overly
sour
and
tangy
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mediumfull
body
with
modest
carbonation
this
was
an
ok
stout
though
a
bit
sour
the
other
beers
in
this
bottled
set
were
not
sour
the
beer
poured
a
fairly
deep
brown
not
quite
black
color
with
a
think
tan
head
into
my
pint
glass
the
nose
is
a
roasted
malt
and
coffee
mix
that
is
pleasing
the
taste
is
roasted
as
well
and
although
i
enjoy
the
initial
blast
of
the
coffee
flavor
it
does
not
linger
long
enough
to
really
enjoy
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
i
couldnt
handle
drinking
more
than
one
and
i
may
not
even
finish
this
one
its
not
hoorrible
but
the
alcohol
aftertaste
is
a
killjoy
and
kind
of
ruins
the
experience
for
me
drinkability
a
weak
start
but
a
solid
stout
where
it
matters
mouthfeeldrinkability
i
am
daring
myself
to
go
further
nope
aint
gonna
happen
the
harsh
acidic
attack
in
the
mouth
leaves
no
place
for
texture
i
am
trying
but
this
beer
needs
serious
help
goodbye
lump
of
coal
i
certainly
did
not
deserve
this
punishment
this
winter
d
this
had
some
nice
roasted
dark
malt
aromas
but
it
sour
tart
cidery
taste
is
really
dominating
the
finish
im
not
sure
if
because
this
is
a
holiday
brew
that
this
is
on
purpose
or
if
this
is
a
bad
bottle
it
doesnt
have
notes
of
oxidation
or
any
other
signs
of
infection
such
as
over
carbonation
or
mold
floaters
drinkability
this
beer
was
dam
near
a
drain
pour
i
dont
know
if
i
drank
it
to
late
and
it
expired
to
many
other
good
stouts
out
there
to
waste
time
or
money
on
this
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
will
buy
again
500
ml
bottle
pours
a
reddish
black
color
with
a
small
brown
head
that
quickly
disappears
that
does
leave
some
lacing
in
my
glass
chocolate
aromas
cola
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
not
much
carbonation
gives
this
a
watery
mouthfeel
alcohol
aftertaste
not
a
very
flavorful
stout
well
they
cant
all
be
homeruns
probably
good
for
a
guy
who
drinks
guinness
at
bars
but
doesnt
have
much
experience
with
craft
beers
this
is
yet
another
dud
shelton
bros
english
import
okay
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
cost
plus
lack
of
taste
equals
not
another
purchase
the
label
talks
the
talk
but
the
beer
doesnt
walk
the
walk
on
the
whole
this
beer
tastes
alright
but
too
many
aspects
leave
me
saying
ho
hum

my
first
bottle
was
given
to
me
as
a
gift
thanks
howard
lynne
the
second
bottle
was
sampled
at
a
party
i
am
happy
i
didnt
have
to
buy
this
one
heed
my
review
and
skip
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
certainly
not
opaque
smell
is
quite
fruity
black
cherry
molasses
it
actually
smells
very
much
like
a
nice
dopplebock
odd
but
perhaps
not
bad
upfront
on
the
palate
is
a
quick
stab
of
roast
then
mild
chocolate
and
a
large
fruitiness
that
then
backs
away
as
earthiness
evolves
through
the
finish
not
overly
complex
but
a
good
flavor
albeit
insipid
and
a
bit
watery
for
an
8
stout
medium
low
carbonation
and
extremely
drinkable
if
nothing
else
not
even
a
hint
of
the
8
here
i
guess
i
was
naughty
last
year
there
was
something
very
wrong
with
this
beer
it
was
totally
sour
and
gross
maybe
that
was
the
point
or
some
infection
was
the
culprit
the
beer
was
black
but
the
head
was
more
like
a
white
haze
on
the
top
there
was
next
to
no
smell
and
the
flavor
was
like
sour
milk
i
guess
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
mouthfeel
exept
being
thin
for
the
style
oh
well
dnf
the
taste
well
mighty
weak
in
the
malts
poor
for
the
style
with
a
noticeable
hoppy
finish
couple
hints
of
charcoal
burnt
toast
but
just
hints
the
whole
bottle
was
thin
and
watery
and
the
harshness
lasted
throughout
i
suppose
one
could
say
this
was
drinkable
but
the
price
over
5
for
a
500ml
bottle
would
keep
me
away
for
any
serious
session
work
just
not
much
character
to
be
found
pours
black
alright
but
the
disturbing
thing
about
this
sample
and
seemingly
a
few
other
bas
is
the
vinous
sourness
that
suggests
to
me
lactobacillus
infection
the
beer
was
much
too
sour
for
the
style
and
all
the
roasty
notes
were
covered
up
with
the
sourness
tasted
like
an
ok
watery
stout
that
somehow
picked
up
an
infection
drinkability
very
average
at
best
i
like
a
winter
brew
to
warm
me
up
during
the
cold
months
but
this
was
a
stout
that
would
work
well
in
the
summer
heat
since
it
is
so
light
this
is
a
lame
stout
thats
not
very
impressive
at
all
save
your
5
50
and
spend
it
on
something
else
i
wont
even
waste
my
time
with
the
rest
of
a
review
disgusting
swill
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
ruby
edges
thick
eggwhite
creamy
head
head

leaving
a
very

and

the
aroma

flavor
starts
off

then

the
back

to
fall
off
warming

presence
slight
earthy
hop
flavor
low
carbonation
it
started
off
fairly
well
but
really
falls
apart
at
the
end
disappointing
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
soapy
tan
head
subdued
roasty
aromas
with
a
slight
earthiness
very
malty
upfront
with
a
light
resiny
molasseslike
finish
with
lingering
spiciness
the
english
stout
characteristics
are
pronounced
maybe
stepped
up
a
notch
still
kind
of
watery
but
not
taking
away
from
the
whole
experience
not
the
greatest
stout
to
come
from
across
the
pond
but
certainly
no
sloucher
pairs
up
nicely
with
it
snowin
like
a
mofo
outside
right
now
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
for
savoring
mostly
because
of
price
otherwise
i
could
destroy
a
6pk
of
it
drinkability
is
well
its
good
but
for
the
price
wouldnt
purchase
again
as
i
could
be
drinking
something
better
for
the
money
a
very
dark
colorbut
the
head
was
small
and
left
wat
too
soon
the
smell
is
very
faint
with
only
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
a
little
lightbut
you
can
taste
both
coffee
and
chocolate
the
mf
is
lightmedium
and
not
as
balanced
as
i
would
like
this
is
a
pretty
good
stoutbut
i
would
try
a
different
one
next
time
just
because
this
is
so
expensive
not
bad
but
not
great
and
worth
the
5
89
i
paid
for
the
25
ounce
bottle
not
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
many
of
these
at
8
its
an
okay
end
to
the
day
but
i
can
think
of
other
holiday
beers
that
id
pick
over
this
one
mdr
a
little
light
on
the
carbonation
and
somewhat
of
a
light
body
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
was
smooth
and
nicely
balanced
to
be
sure
but
i
like
my
stouts
to
be
more
of
a
stout
i
may
have
needed
to
let
this
warm
up
a
bit
to
open
the
bouquet
and
taste
this
is
an
alright
brew
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
for
the
money
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
one
again
it
isnt
terrible
but
there
is
much
better
stuff
out
there
for
the
samecomparable
price
pours
not
quite
a
lump
of
coal
dark
but
close
with
some
nice
ruby
tint
thru
out
with
an
off
white
head
that
is
gone
quite
quickly
deeply
roasted
malt
and
dark
fruit
in
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
milk
chocolatebig
robust
flavors
for
a
big
stout
tarry
and
fruity
roasted
of
course
with
a
light
smoky
flavor
in
the
finish
wow
i
really
like
theis
holiday
stout
big
and
complex
and
quite
quaffable
to
boot
d
overall
this
is
a
quite
delicious
and
deceptively
drinkable
stout
not
quite
like
other
traditional
english
stouts
ive
tried
this
one
bears
some
resemblance
to
foreign
stout
imo
interestingly
from
the
several
socalled
foreign
stouts
ive
tried
despite
their
high
alc
strength
somehow
theyre
mostly
thinbodied
i
really
wonder
why
overall
an
interesting
beer
perhaps
a
little
less
stouty
than
id
like
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
too
up
front
but
definately
worth
a
try
mediumfull
bodied
reasonably
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
well
balanced
but
not
really
strong
on
anything
very
low
carbonation
and
well
hidden
alcohol
content
notes
not
for
me
not
bad
not
good
i
demand
excellence
this
is
not
it
but
i
do
love
all
the
stories
on
the
label
dark
but
not
opaque
mahogany
highlights
shine
through
tannish
head
head
is
not
big
but
leaves
collars
for
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
reserved
mostly
pale
caramelized
sugar
not
much
special
flattish
mouthfeel
and
not
that
pleasant
not
coating
or
creamy
flavors
show
some
aspects
of
generic

into

weak
coffee
but
without
an
overall
hardroasted
bitterness
this
beer
has
the
alcohol
content
to
verge
on
imperial
or
double
in
strength
but
compare
it
to
samuel
smith
imperial
and
its
easy
to
see
that
it
doesnt
have
nearly
the
interest
sweet
and
unidimensional
maybe

very

it
isnt
the
best
member
of

but
that
probably
has
more
to
do
with
my
affection
for
hoppy
beer
than
anything
else
its
a
solid
effort
that
id
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
at
christmas
or
any
other
time
of
the
year
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
getting
a
lump
of
coal
in
my
stocking
this
december
25th
not
bad
id
be
interested
to
have
one
that
had
been
sitting
around
for
half
a
year
or
so
drinkability
oh
heck
yes
even
with
an
8
abv
i
could
drink
this
fine
brew
all
day
with
or
without
food
this
is
a
great
beer
is
not
a
bad
brew
but
the
harshness
makes
it
a
little
rough
the
odd
overall
feel
of
it
makes
it
a
christmas
time
drink
once
a
year
the
fruit
comes
out
as
it
warms
and
it
became
a
little
more
pleasant
but
i
must
say
ridgeway
could
tweak
this
into
a
firstrate
classic
had
this
one
on
tap
a
couple
of
nights
ago
poured
to
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
no
head
what
so
ever
must
say
from
the
way
it
looked
i
was
questioning
what
i
had
gotten
the
aromas
where
quite
nice
with
a
rich
chocolate
flavor
with
a
fruit
like
tinge
to
it
along
a
burnttoasted
smell
the
taste
was
dominated
by
a
burn
malt
flavor
with
some
sweetness
that
seems
to
go
well
together
over
all
this
brew
was
not
bad
not
a
favorite
by
any
stretch
but
one
i
would
try
again
very
interesting
label
design
but
the
blurb
on
the
side
about
having
this
to
make
family
gatherings
bearable
was
a
bit
of
a
downer
poured
an
appropriate
coal
black
with
almost
no
head
and
little
visible
carbonation
overall
carbonation
was
low
but
adequate
hint
of
chocolate
malt
in
the
aroma
malt
flavor
contained
a
pronounced
but
pleasant
hardwood
smoke
note
finish
was
sweet
with
lingering
lactose
sugar
flavor
the
beer
is
certainly
weighted
toward
the
sweet
stout
end
of
the
english
spectrum
not
impressive
but
enjoyable
poured
with
small
tan
head
that
faded
into
a
skim
and
a
black
as
night
color
roasted
barley
mainly
dominating
the
aroma
with
some
soft
syrupy
molasses
treacle
and
burnt
sugar
also
sweet
taste
upfront
followed
a
burnt
toast
maybe
burnt
malt
or
burnt
sugar
very
very
balanced
beer
and
very
drinkable
body
does
get
a
little
on
the
thin
side
as
it
warms
up
and
then
you
get
some
alcohol
but
still
very
nice
big
thanks

this
beer
pours
a
dark
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
has
lots
of
chocolate
and
a
little
coffee
very
pleasant
the
flavor
is
mostly
chocolate
with
a
tiny
bit
of
coffee
and
a
hint
of
raisin
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
quite
enjoyable
its
a
bit
rich
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
ill
happily
try
drinkability
a
nice
christmas
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
be
back
too
much
other
fun
stuff
out
there
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
finger
tall
dark
tan
head
looks
nice
the
nose
is
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
ton
of
chocolate
in
there
its
very
sweet
the
flavor
is
nice
tons
of
chocolate
in
there
but
it
takes
a
second
for
your
tongue
to
recognize
it
the
aftertaste
is
very
mellow
with
just
a
slight
hint
of
hop
dancing
on
my
tongue
the
feel
on
this
beer
is
moerate
to
thick
a
bit
creamy
as
well
velvety
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
as
it
warms
it
becomes
even
more
drinkable
drinkability
is
average
some
decent
flavors
but
kind
of
onedimensional
and
somehat
flat
not
bad
just
not

ybnorml0
is
it
too
much
to
ask
for
a
head
on
my
beer
a
fairly
decent
beer
not
quite
as
sweet
as
some
of
the
other
foreign
export
stouts
but
there
was
some
coming
through
in
the
taste
particularly
towards
the
end
and
the
alcohol
content
of
the
beer
was
relatively
well
hidden
too
overall
pretty
solid
export
stout
becoming
more
and
more
a
fan
of
the
style
o
this
beer
is
a
nice
soft
stout
with
a
bright
fruity
ester
tartness
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
it
drinks
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
the
flavor
and
depth
really
grow
as
the
beer
opens
and
warms
this
is
better
than
a
lot
of
beers
out
there
but
so
far
below
my
expectations
overall

i
have
to
type
it
again
strange
brew
this
has
so
many
things
wrong
with
it
that
i
do
not
wish
to
go
through
them
again
here
see
above
and
buy
at
your
own
risk
maybe
i
picked
up
a
dud
bottle
o
a
very
good
drinkable
beer
slightly
boozier
than
the
style
usually
merits
but
still
very
tasty
taste
briefly
seems
to
live
up
to
the
aroma
but
soon
fades
at
first
it
has
nice
rich
somewhat
sweet
prune
fig
and
earthy
brown
bread
up
front
followed
by
drier
earthy
toasted
breadcoffee
bitterness
in
the
finish
however
this
all
soon
degrades
a
bit
becoming
thinner
more
bland
and
muddled
with
the
coffeeroasty
earthiness
fading
away
mostly
and
leaving
the
beer
more
of
a
sweeter
and
alcoholic
character
although
it
is
never
overly
boozy
or
heavy
it
is
not
as
good
as
and
does
not
maintain
the
complexity
and
depth
of
character
as
well
as
guinness
foreign
stout
nice
niice
starts
good
and
wins
in
the
long
run
sweet
and
doughy
what
i
imagine
chocolate
bread
were
to
taste
like
if
it
existed
sharp
fruit
mild
hops
and
some
burnt
malts
all
contribute
to
a
rather
abrasive
finish
hmmm
just
does
not
seem
to
all
come
together
in
an
enjoyable
fashion
body
is
ok
but
lacks
a
silky
creaminess
that
the
best
of
stouts
seem
to
have
its
ok
but
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
this
out
again
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
which
is
scary
at
8
not
a
hint
of
booze
in
this
one
not
the
thick
denselyflaovred
export
stout
youd
expect
balanced
and
properly
subdued
worthy
of
a
try
pours
a
nice
dark
opaque
sable
with
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
a
little
bit
aroma
is
malty
spicy
and
chocolaty
with
a
hint
of
coffee
flavor
is
like
decent
mocha
with
hints
of
malt
and
molasses
and
just
a
touch
of
spice
mainly
cloves
texture
is
smooth
just
a
teensy
watery
a
little
bit
fizzy
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
but
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
with
enough
complexity
to
remain
interesting
drinkability
decently
drinkable
stout
thats
pleasant
though
not
particularly
pronounced
not
sure
what
was
causing
the
aroma
to
smell
the
way
it
did
but
it
was
the
only
flaw
this
beer
had
luckily
it
didnt
affect
the
taste
in
any
way
good
drinkability
a
solid
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
a
foreign
export
stout
a
good
stout
with
a
typical
look
a
bit
mocha
head
nose
is
a
nice
english
toasty
malt
and
mild

is

creamy

nice

a

too
bring
out
the

quality
great
feel
no
abv
noticable
on
the
nose
even
though
i
had
it
at
cellar
temp
definitely
liked
this
one
price
was
a
little
high
but
id
buy
it
again
an
ok
stout
maybe
a
bit
too
neutral
the
alcohol
was
quite
well
hidden
drinkability
fairly
well
masked
abv
very
bitter
for
a
stout
was
pretty
affordable
certainly
a
must
try
for
stout
folks
one
of
the
better
ridgeway
beers
i
have
had
this
should
be
in
the
christmas
pack
instead
of
the
other
sub
par
offerings
worth
a
try
overall
did
not
know
ridgway
could
make
something
this
good
and
i
mean
that
in
the
nicest
possible
way
this
was
a
fantastic
stout
that
i
would
put
up
against
a
few
of
the
big
boys
any
day
very
well
done
cannot
wait
to
try
another
still
drinkable
but
past
its
prime
the
distributors
need
to
do
better
since
this
was
actually
a
recent
arrival
to
the
store
despite
the
age
of
the
bottles
then
again
ridgeway
might
want
to
consider
switching
to
a
less
cryptic
batch
dating
scheme
md
im
not
sure
or
i
suspect
if
the
beer
is
bottleconditioned
as
not
a
single
bit
of
yeast
sediment
is
detected
at
the
bottom
of
the
empty
bottle
but
the
carbonation
is
quite
soft
and
natural
showing
no
trace
of
artificial
co2
injection
as
far
as
my
tastebuds
could
tell
semi
fullbodied
charminglyflavoured
with
a
sourfruity
balance
all
round
all
in
all
this
is
a
moderate
choice
for
ris
newcomers
but
also
a
petite
and
fine
example
of
ris
for
experienced
drinks
that
could
spot
delicacies
amongst
big
flavours
smooth
start
to
finish
a
charming
pint
to
be
sure
d
this
was
one
of
the
highlights
of
nerax
very
tasty
overall
a
tasty
and
well
done
ris
a
pitch
black
stout
with
a
full
tan
colored
head
i
couldnt
smell
anything
but
i
could
taste
a
lot
the
beer
had
a
rich
heavy
but
pleasant
roasted
taste
i
noticed
at
times
a
slight
and
unpleasant
sour
tinge
i
did
not
notice
the
sour
taste
with
every
sip
but
it
was
there
often
enough
for
me
to
make
a
note
of
it
i
couldnt
taste
the
alcohol
the
beer
went
down
smooth
a
little
too
smooth
for
my
tastes
for
an
8
abv
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
acidity
and
alcohol
bite
both
liven
things
up
without
overwhelming
this
brew
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
distinctly
ruby
hues
if
held
up
to
a
light
source
the
head
is
modest
but
longlasting
and
fairly
dark
the
aroma
is
solid
with
a
touch
of
roast
grain
some
malt
a
little
esterinduce
fruitiness
pear
and
plum
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
still
its
not
as
intense
as
i
would
have
likes
and
i
found
myself
hunting
for
the
smells
even
after
a
significant
warming
the
flavor
though
is
nice
the
roasted
grains
give
the
beer
an
espressolike
quality
that
balances
the
initial
malt
sweetness
very
well
its
both
aggressively
sweet
and
intensely
grainy
and
the
flavors
do
a
great
job
of
playing
off
one
another
lots
of
malt
flavor
with
a
prism
of
roast
qualities
coming
through
from
pale
base
malt
through
burnt
malts
thick
and
mouth
coating
not
at
all
dry
and
not
a
low
alcohol
beer
but
both
these
qualities
are
folded
into
the
experience
great
brew
ridgeways
foreign
export
stout
is
a
strong
8
abv
rich
smooth
full
bodied
stout
good
head
retention
but
relatively
still
dark
and
not
particularly
bitter
the
malts
definitely
over
power
the
hop
presence
but
this
is
no
milk
stout
the
toasty
malt
overtones
are
balanced
by
the
alcoholic
bite
this
is
a
good
stout
for
those
getting
into
the
style
of
strong
stouts
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
and
while
i
probably
will
not
buy
it
again
in
the
near
future
for
the
sake
of
trying
other
ones
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
and
enjoy
an
english
style
stout
d
not
too
bad
at
all
ive
been
drinking
american
beers
lately
so
an
english
beer
is
a
nice
change
up
a
very
drinkable
stout
from
ridgeway
that
despite
its
thin
body
is
quite
tasty
the
8
is
not
really
noticeable
which
makes
this
a
dangerous
beer
to
drink
because
it
goes
down
way
easy
not
bad
at
all
subtle
even
when
warmed
which
is
fine
but
as
a
whole
it
doesnt
stand
out
from
a
crowd
there
is
a
nice
balance
to
the
sweetness
with
sour
and
slightly
bitter
touches
and
a
certain
roastiness
that
comes
through
as
it
progresses
the
8
abv
is
more
than
reasonably
though
not
absolutely
covered
easy
enough
to
drink
d
very
drinkable
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
if
not
for
the
8
d
super
drinkable

i

this

a
bit
of
cherry
to
the
list
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
light
a
bit
watery
easy
on
the
tongue
the
aftertaste
is
quite
modest
im
guessing
that
the
abv
is
in
the
67
range
if
it
is
higher
than
this
beer
is
even
more
outstanding
for
completely
masking
the
alcohol
tones
this
beer
is
well
worth
seeking
out
and
is
one
i
would
go
back
to
lchaim
finish
is
quite
long
with
chocolate
a
good
stout
with
coco
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
not
overthetop
nicely
drinkable
dark
brown
sweet
with
bitterness
there
some
brown
sugar
soft
carbonation
yet
medium
mouthfeel
also
understated
roast
and
nuttiness
nice
this
is
aged
and
i
am
interested
to
know
how
long
so
for
maximum
enjoyment
make
sure
the
chill
is
gone
before
drinking
foreign
export
stout
although
i
had
an
increasingly
good
time
with
this
one
i
wont
be
buying
another
bottle
ridgeway
ipa
is
still
the
class
of
this
brewery
as
far
as
im
concerned
for
an
interesting
export
stout
try
guinness
export
or
de
dolle
no
amount
of
gold
foil
on
the
label
will
save
this
one
smooth
velvety
mouthfeel
slightly
sour
aftertaste
to
this
but
overall
a
generally
well
done
stout
it
comes
off
more
as
an
double
stout
than
an
fes
but
still
a
very
nice
drink
this
stout
poured
jet
black
in
color
with
very
light
brown
creamy
smooth
nitrogen
foam
that
persisted
a
long
time
the
smell
was
dark
malt
with
some
licorice
dark
mollasses
and
hints
of
toffee
and
chocolate
the
taste
was
darkly
malty
and
lightly
sweet
with
flavors
of
toffee
mollasses
dark
caramel
and
a
touch
of
fruitiness
the
hops
were
there
but
were
somewhat
buried
beneath
the
onslaught
of
the
malty
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
creamy
and
silky
with
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
the
aftertaste
was
very
pleasantly
malty
this
was
a
very
very
nice
stout
and
was
easy
to
drink
hope
to
see
more
of
this
high
c
overall
quite
a
big
chewy
stout
that
hides
the
abv
well
with
a
roasty
almost
smoke
like
flavor
not
bad
interesting
to
sip
but
that
hint
of
burnt
oatmeal
gets
old
from
the
22
oz
bottle
bought
at
total
wine
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cookie
dough
cocoa
and
slight
soy
sauce
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cookie
dough
cocoa
powder
and
pretzels
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
has
a
better
taste
than
smell
in
my
opinion
overall
i
like
this
brew
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
good
and
balanced
stout
id
have
it
again
for
sure
o
great
flavor
but
let
down
by
the
feel
an
allnighter
none
the
less
overall
nothing
special
but
is
still
quite
a
solid
beer
that
you
shouldnt
ignore
o
i
found
this
appealing
overall
and
would
definitely
pick
one
up
again
in
the
future
if
i
saw
it
this
experience
has
encouraged
me
to
try
out
other
marin
brews
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
ok
tasting
average
stout
roasted
malts
are
main
taste
of
this
beer
no
chocolate
or
coffee
here
the
one
thing
that
bothered
me
was
the
carbonation
this
beer
is
way
over
carbonated
which
kills
the
mouthfeel
all
in
all
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
there
just
too
many
other
stouts
out
there
that
are
better
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
2
finger
mocha
tan
head
roast
coffee
notes
along
with
some
dark
chocolate
medium
mouthfeel
with
carbonation
slightly
over
carbonated
starts
off
with
a
slight
chocolate
sweetness
dark
fruit
and
then
transitions
to
a
light
roast
bitter
flavor
some
lacing
some
lingering
roast
bitterness
notes
overall
this
is
pretty
good
beer
this
is
overly
dry
at
first
which
i
do
not
like
in
stouts
it
does
get
better
as
it
warms
but
overall
a
pretty
average
stout
this
is
a
solid
easy
going
stout
pretty
straightforward
but
not
too
simple
to
make
it
boring
or
forgettable
a
nice
choice
when
you
dont
want
the
heaviness
of
a
10
abv
stout
but
want
some
of
the
same
characteristics
on
cask
this
could
be
epic
do
a
very
warming
stout
thats
not
too
filling
good
stuff
itd
be
interesting
to
age
a
bottle
and
let
the
alcohol
fade
a
bit
overall
at
first
i
liked
the
tang
taste
because
it
was
a
bit
different
but
now
im
having
second
thoughts
the
bottle
was
marked
down
from
full
price
at
bev
mos
so
it
could
by
chance
be
a
bit
aged
pp
price
point
spot
on
for
7
a
22oz
bomber
just
not
as
strong
flavor
or
abv
wise
on
tap
from
the
library
ale
house
in
venice
beach
a
very
inviting
black
brew
with
a
heavy
espresso
foam
head
the
nose
has
all
the
usual
suspects
of
a
good
stout
coffee
molasses
wow
the
taste
is
chocolate
coffee
toffee
and
very
nice
with
a
lingering
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
semi
sweet
witha
feeling
of
a
cola
float
medium
bodied
and
creamy
overall
this
goes
down
like
water
feed
the
camel
as
i
am
parched
at
the
time
of
this
tasting
it
seems
as
though
i
could
consume
quite
a
few
of
these
pints
with
great
ease
overall
i
am
very
let
down
by
this
one
i
really
love
all
the
moylans
stuff
and
this
being
a
side
project
or
sister
i
know
you
guys
can
do
better
than
this
at
the
very
end
of
this
one
and
the
lace
never
happened
at
all
and
as
this
warms
it
doesnt
get
any
better
just
tarter
i
give
this
one
a
thumbsup
pretty
solid
beer
with
a
nice
mix
of
roast
chocolate
and
coffee
this
is
just
too
thin
to
be
a
great
stout
in
fact
i
could
see
a
more
adventurous
brewer
losing
the
vanilla
and
packaging
this
as
schwarzbier
or
hopping
it
up
and
calling
it
a
cascadian
black
which
is
fine
it
still
tastes
good
but
its
not
a
really
full
viscous
stout
body
bottle
purchased
from
city
beer
in
san
francisco
pours
a
pitch
black
with
tan
head
head
starts
out
pretty
thick
but
then
dissipates
to
almost
nothing
within
about
a
minute
very
thin
lacing
on
some
of
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
malt
without
too
much
else
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
flavour
is
fairly
sweet
i
get
some
type
of
salty
note
too
thinner
mouthfeel
than
many
stouts
of
this
strength
a
pretty
good
stout
but
nothing
too
outstanding
poured
into
my
snifter
and
i
am
met
with
a
jet
black
ale
with
a
nice
mocha
brown
foamy
head
with
staying
power
the
aroma
consists
of
chocolate
espresso
leather
hot
cocoa
and
roasted
dark
malts
very
nice
the
taste
has
the
ever
present
coffee
characteristics
up
front
but
a
heavy
dose
of
chocolate
on
the
swallow
followed
by
roasty
malty
bitter
aftertaste
it
all
works
well
together
a
lot
going
on
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
light
carbonation
i
think
the
drinkability
is
great
its
a
perfect
compliment
to
the
rainy
night
i
am
currently
enduring
at
7
its
not
too
tough
to
get
multiples
and
enjoy
them
heartily
very
good
hv
pours
a
black
color
with
a
thin
brown
head
very
sweet
aroma
with
chockate
and
coffee
tastes
from
vanilla
chocolate
and
coffee
finishes
with
a
slight
dry
bitterness
overall
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
very
drinkable
a
good
beer
for
the
morning
not
very
extreme
but
very
flavorful
pretty
decent
for
the
price
drinkability
is
good
wow
i
am
impressed
this
is
a
top
notch
stout
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in

its

not

recommended
dnice
body
that
goes

easy
not

thick
to
enjoy
but
enough
to
make
it
have
a
real
stout
feel
pretty
big
flavors
and
nicely
roasted
malts
overall
a
careful
and
tasty
effort
from
marin
d
a
very
nice
counterpart
to
the
syrupy
and
sweet
big
stouts
that
seem
to
be
filling
fridges
as
of
late
d
really
pretty
drinkable
for
being
so
heavy
on
flavor
and
at
7
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
stout
the
woody
notes
follow
through
on
the
palate
along
with
coffee
and
a
roasted
maltiness
in
fact
while
i
was
drinking
this
i
really
wanted
to
be
sitting
by
a
fire
decent
enough
but
this
really
suffers
from
that

the

pretty

i
always

this

i
think
their

is
the
better
dark
beer
option
if
you
are
at
the
pub
d
this
is
a
decent
dry
stout
it
needs
some
improvement
but
its
really
not
bad
once
it
warms
up
and
hits
its
stride
d
this
is
surprisingly
a
pretty
heady
stout
that
feels
even
bigger
than

some

fits
in

with

style
a
solid

for
sure
and
the
7
abv
is
hidden
quite
well
worth
a
shot
d
overall
the
drinkability
is
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
sweeter
stout
and
found
this
one
to
be
evenly
balanced
across
the
board
session
beer
if
any
thing
this
guy
needs
a
kick
in
the
thick
rear
i
likeem
chewy
a
good
solid
stout
perfect
if
you
want
something
with
body
but
not
a
meal
in
a
beer
this
beer
may
be
on
the
lighter
side
but
it
does
not
sacrifice
anything
d
a
really
good
stout
from
marin
one
of
the
best
american
made
stouts
ive
had
for
sure
definitely
worth
a
look
the
pour
was
very
good
deep
dark
brown
in
color
essentially
black
with
no
light
shining
through
on
this
one
at
all
this
was
one
damn
big
looking
beer
as
it
settles
a
two
inch
head
of
tan
rose
up
and
then
settled
back
down
into
a
thin
half
in
layer
that
stayed
forever
dropping
lots
of
lace
down
the
sides
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
aroma
here
rich
with
hints
of
molasses
and
burnt
caramel
really
big
aroma
here
the
flavor
was
full
rich
taste
of
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
cocoa
and
coffee
nice
sweetness
and
a
dry
finish
here
with
almost
all
the
alcohol
completely
hidden
nice
feel
rich
with
a
full
body
and
a
nice
subtle
finish
to
it
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
one
as
close
to
a
sessionable
big
stout
as
you
are
going
to
get
this
is
a
must
seek
out
great
balance
of
flavors
but
lacks
in
overall
firepower
still
you
could
make
this
a
good
session
beer
it
quaffs
well
an
oil
black
body
hosts
a
three
finger
carmel
brown
head
that
turns
cavernes
as
it
slowly
fades
nose
has
tones
of
zesty
spice
coco
tootsie
rolls
and
meaty
smoke
enters
the
mouth
with
a
hollow
smokey
and
slightly
sour
feel
zesty
as
it
bounces
of
the
tongue
carried
by
good
carbonation
a
hint
of
bitter
coco
arrives
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
flavor
profile
was
not
quite
what
nose
had
previewed
maybe
a
hint
of
rye
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
dry
dark
bitter
side
mellows
as
it
warms
for
decent
drinkability
once
you
are
past
the
fact
the
label
does
not
accurately
represent
the
beer
it
seems
they
are
talking
about
a
10
abv
ris
it
is
a
worthwhile
bottle
pours
black
with
a
gigantic
tan
head
one
of
the
biggest
i
have
ever
seen
heavy
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
huge
roast
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
a
solid
roasted
aftertaste
rolls
around
on
the
tongue
long
after
you
have
quaffed
it
all
excellent
stout
much
better
than
the
dipsea
pours
opaque
black
with
a
tiny
brown
head
aroma
dominated
by
chocolate
coffee
and
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
bold
malty
roasty
with
the
coffee
and
chocolate
brining
up
the
rear
creamy
mouthfeel
a
great
beer
all
around
not
bad
on
the
whole
but
nothing
out
of
this
world
its
an
interesting
flavor
profile
that
i
could
see
being
loved
but
it
didnt
do
a
ton
for
me
and
the
mouthfeel
was
just
a
bit
off
ill
have
to
hunt
out
another
bottle
and
see
if
its
significantly
different
but
other
than
that
i
dont
plan
on
getting
this
one
any
time
soon
md
not
much
behind
this
one
too
tart
and
sour
for
my
liking
maybe
in
a
lambic
or
a
sour
ale
but
not
my
stouts
i
actually
poured
this
one
out
d
its
only
6
1
i
like
when
these
beers
are
used
to
hide
10
or
above
if
you
are
a
stout
guy
or
gal
have
this
one
for
breakfest
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
tawny
brown
head
head
is
retained
nicely
chocolatey
mildly
sweet
and
tinny
odor
nice
sweet
toasty
malt
creamy
chocolate
notes
sweet
chocolate
is
not
overwhelming
just
a
nice
undercurrent
like
shaved
choco
flakes
high
alcohol
not
obvious
in
the
taste
medium
bodied
nice
smoothness
drinks
well
enjoyable
d
half
the
bottle
was
dumped
my
second
problem
with
marin
damn
it
the
taste
is
even
better
than
the
smell
its
similarly
big
on
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
there
is
great
balance
from
some
bitter
notes
its
a
great
stout
flavor
the
smoothness
of
the
mouthfeel
well
complements
the
flavor
of
the
beer
this
smoothness
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
for
me
particularly
for
a
stout
d
complex
with
intriguing
flavors
tasty
excellent
for
style
and
overall
very
njoyable
black
rich
thick
and
tasty
this
one
is
like
a
black
hole
a
nice
thick
tan
head
pours
on
this
one
this
one
is
mild
a
tuch
sweet
and
not
to
bitter
this
one
doesent
lack
in
any
area
i
easely
can
see
why
this
one
won
gold
at
the
world
beer
cup
and
the
great
american
beer
festival
if
you
are
luckey
enough
to
come
across
this
one
get
2
or
3
d
i
think
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
stout
drinkability
although
the
sour
element
that
appears
midpalate
is
an
unfortunate
distraction
this
is
basically
a
pretty
tasty
stout
and
much
improved
over
what
i
had
on
tap
a
few
years
ago
poured
a
deep
blac
of
course
very
sluggish
even
like
pouring
burnt
oil
had
a
fluffy
light
brown
head
nose
was
roasted
espresso
and
some
chocolate
taste
was
watery
for
a
stout
wont
even
lie
about
it
roasted
malts
espresso
dominate
mouthfeel
is
roasty
this
could
easily
be
labaled
as
deep
porter
just
by
taste
and
mouthfeel
not
thick
enough
to
be
a
stout
wont
drink
again
drinkability
is
good
even
with
the
slight
sour
edge
i
still
enjoyed
it
good
malty
base
nicely
balanced
i
think
im
going
to
try
and
get
another
bottle
of
this
one
and
reevaluate
disappointing
lack
of
robustness
makes
this
one
a
bit
of
a
miss
thick
black
opaque
pour
with
a
fluffy
brown
head
smell
is
standard
roasty
malt
with
bits
of
chocolate
andor
coffee
at
times
upon
first
sip
its
easy
to
see
this
is
excessively
overcarbonated
for
a
stout
or
any
style
not
sure
if
its
just
my
bottle
but
its
like
drinking
black
champagne
taste
is
semi
dry
roasty
malt
and
is
fairly
onenote
and
simplistic
but
nice
overall
not
great
and
im
hoping
it
was
just
this
bottle
with
the
freak
carbonation
creamy
texture
as
stated
in
the
commercial
description
couldnt
be
farther
from
the
truth
in
my
experience
d
all
right
the
sourness
isnt
great
fortunately
the
grassy
hops
do
a
little
bit
to
suppress
this
flavor
i
doubt
i
will
have
again
there
are
more
enjoyable
stouts
out
there
that
lack
the
off
sour
flavor
not
terrible
though
drinks
okay
but
the
dryness
is
a
bit
too
ott
for
me
coffee
stout
lovers
will
probably
dig
this
will
certainly
give
other
beers
from
this
brewery
a
go
the
aroma
was
oatmeal
and
coffee
the
taste
was
chocolaty
and
coffee
flavored
balanced
by
a
oatmeal
element
in
the
mouth
it
was
a
little
soft
with
not
much
depth
to
it
it
was
a
tad
bit
thin
for
my
taste
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
this
beer
is
actually
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
especially
for
one
that
clocks
in
at
7
abv
a
little
more
robustness
would
help
carry
the
flavor
but
its
not
a
big
detriment
on
the
whole
an
enjoyable
stout
and
one
thats
even
better
if
you
can
get
it
fresh
d
i
think
its
really
tasty
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
aroma
other
than
that
it
is
a
great
brew
and
body
is
a
little
thin
d
nice
and
smooth
drinking
stout
this
is
a
solid
offering
that
unfortunately
lacks
any
sort
of
boldness
or
uniqueness
being
a
fan
of
the
more
imperial
styles
of
stouts
i
doubt
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
this
middleoftheroad
offering
again
in
the
future
this
is
a
deeply
satisfying
brew
it
is
certainly
not
an
imperial
stout
but
is
on
the
rich
side
for
a
stout
still
quite
drinkable
though
it
certainly
is
not
thirst
quenching
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
too
creamy
and
rich
for
that
i
have
had
this
beer
a
couple
times
and
each
time
i
have
really
enjoyed
it
it
has
really
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
heft
that
just
really
works
and
makes
for
a
flavorful
favorable
drinking
experience
d
the
sourness
of
the
body
is
drying
making
one
instinctively
reach
for
another
sip
the
strong
profile
makes
for
a
good
drink
this
is
a
very
flavorful
and
solid
stout
from
an
overall
great
brewery
this
would
make
a
great
session
stout
drinkability
this
stout
has
a
powerful
flavor
that
leaves
your
tastebuds
reeling
a
bit
not
that
ris
sort
of
i
am
a
huge
ass
stout
sip
me
and
appreciate
me
way
but
more
of
a
i
am
a
huge
ass
stout
and
will
aggressively
tear
up
your
tongue
as
you
try
to
force
me
down
sort
of
way
still
its
appropriate
for
a
stout
to
be
big
huge
and
perhaps
menacing
i
would
just
say
that
this
falls
a
bit
too
much
on
the
menacing
side
unnecessarily
without
much
balance
still
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
fantastic
big
stout
and
if
nothing
else
unique
from
a
22

bottle
this
poured

cheers
chees
mfd
a
little
high
on
the
carbonation
levels
but
the
richness
of
the
ingredients
covers
it
well
an
easy
drinking
tasty
stout
enjoyable
enough
for
several
pints
worth
deep
virtually
black
hue
a
flash
of
hazy
crimson
appears
when
held
to
light
thin
but
steadfast
tan
head
yields
sparse
form
trails
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
rounded
notes
of
bakers
cocoa
singed
chocolate
cookie
along
with
a
savory
salty
tinge
obviously
sweeter
honey
and
fudge
notes
surface
as
the

aromawise
upfront
in
flavor
is
a
bittersweet
combination
of
burnt
barley
and
raisiny
dark
lovibond
caramel
malt
midpalate
notions
of
dark
chocolate
infused
mocha
appear
and
linger
agreeably
a

metallic
twang
comes
forth
as
the
beer
breathes
thinnish

cleanly
with
quickly
fleeting

prune
san
quentins
a
well
balanced
stout
having
ample
cocoa
notes
although
the
thin
body
detracts
from
the
malt
profile
good
overall
drinkability
is
so
so
a
confusing
beer
almost
more
of
a
schwarzbier
than
a
stout
in
nature
i
probably
wont
buy
this
one
again
a
pretty
good
stout
and
better
in
the
bottle
then
there
at
the
brewpub
maybe
the
glasses
other
than
the
unbalanced
acidic
flavor
this
is
a
flavorfull
stout
this
beer
is
black
with
a
big
tan
head
espresso
and
roasted
malts
fill
the
nose
the
taste
is
primarily
roasted
malts
with
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
only
real
flaw
in
this
one
is
that
it
has
too
much
carbonation
this
is
what
guinness
extra
stout
would
be
like
if
it
tasted
really
good
alcohol
is
well
hidden
despite
this
not
being
a
sweet
or
thick
stout
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
the
head
is
tan
and
creamy
it
has
pretty
good
retention
it
leaves
a
thin
lacing
on
the
glass
it
smells
like
roasted
malts
it
also
smells
like
coffee
it
had
a
slightly
nutty
aroma
to
it
it
tastes
coffee
like
also
sweet
malt
flavor
is
very
strong
the
hops
are
present
but
quite
subtle
this
is
a
pretty
good
tasting
stout
it
is
full
bodied
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
it
leaves
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
good
session
beer
because
the
alsohol
content
in
to
too
high
and
the
flavor
is
not
that
aggressive
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
if
i
had
the
chance
a
little
light
feeling
but
still
a
tasty
great
looking
stout
22
oz
bottle
slowly
dissipating
tan
head
atop
this
nearly
black
dense
brew
looks
mightly
appealing
aroma
is
rich
and
full
of
dark
coffee
espresso
and
licorice
flavor
is
very
burnt
and
cooked
dark
and
malty
with
a
slight
hop
bite
and
a
lingering
milk
chocolate
sweetness
very
nice
creamy
luscious
texture
a
sweet
yet
very
charred
stout
alcohol
is
barely
noticeable
aside
from
a
slight
warmth
in
the
belly
a
nice
one
indeed
for
those
that
want
to
sample
guinness
foreign
extra
stout
but
cant
get
it
here
in
the
states
this
one
is
very
similar
another
high
quality
offering
from
marin
brewing
co
drinkability
decent
except
for
the
carbonation
the
taste
wins
me
over
though
good
product
from
marin
brewery
the
smell
is
strong
and
tasty
the
taste
is
good
but
a
little
bit
plain
its
full
of
coffeestyle
malts
and
minor
hops
but
not
much
else
the
alcoholic
content
is
fairly
wellblended
but
still
somewhat
apparent
up
front
in
the
taste
it
does
go
down
easily
as
well
the
beer
as
it
dispenses
from
the
22
ounce
brown
bottle
is
as
dark
as
a
starless
night
the
head
statuesque
creamy
and
a
pleasing
light
chocolate
color
with
the
lace
a
thick
and
clinging
sheet
nose
that
of
roasted
grain
chocolate
and
coffee
that
are
sweet
and
pleasing
to
the
senses
with
the
start
thick
and
sweet
and
the
top
chewy
and
rich
finish
is
benignly
acidic
the
hops
pleasant
in
their
spiciness
quite
dry
after
taste
that
lingers
long
on
the
plate
a
fine
beer
from
a
fine
brewery
this
beer
hides
the
abv
well
and
is
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
just
not
a
great
one
very
black
mahogany
shows
through
only
around
the
extreme
edges
the
head
is
a
light
chocolate
milkshake
foam
that
doesnt
fade
completely
roasty
aroma
with
good
hop
backing
the
flavor
is
dry
up
from
hop
bitterness
mingles
with
the
bittereness
of
burned
toast
in
the
middle
followed
by
a
light
chocolate
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
body
was
far
from
thin
but
in
comparison
to
stouts
of
a
similar
size
it
was
definitely
on
the
thinner
side
good
carbonation
though
all
fours
for
this
beer
its
very
dark
no
noticeable
lacing
or
head
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
tried
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
this
one
has
an
interesting
finish
to
it
i
rather
enjoy
the
burnt
chewy
malty
taste
its
the
perfect
brew
to
be
reviewing
tonight
on
this
cold
rainy
southern
california
evening
it
also
has
a
certain
hop
bitterness
taste
that
i
dont
notice
in
other
stouts
but
its
a
hearty
beer
and
i
would
think
stout
enthusiasts
would
rate
this
fairly
high
marin
brews
a
lot
of
great
beers
the
head
though
came
on
a
lot
nicer
its
a
beautiful
chocolaty

left
coollooking

im
upping

wow
considering
all
of

complexities
here
this
beer
is
going
down
a
little
too
smoothly
but
wow
is
it
tasty
this
stout
is
not

thick
as
many
others
it
is
creamy

decadent

in

the

drinks
impeccably
well
if
you
love

and
have
not
tried
this
one
yet
you
are
missing
out
as
i
make
my
way
through
my
escondido

i
run

malty
smokier
woodier
than
at
first
with
a
touch

quite
easily
though
this
stout
sits
somewhere
between
an
oatmeal
stout
and
an
imperial
stout
in
my
short
book
not
as
dry
or
coffee

as

it
does
have

none

this

is
that
it
isnt
big
enough
that
being
said
for
someone
new
to
imperials
this
would
be
a
good
starter
big
thick
viscous
stout
with
a
dry
brown
butter
nose
with
a
sweet
smoky
mouth
that
lingers
with
a
final
touch
of
brown
sugar
that
stays
on
the
lips
the
stout
cascades
and
holds
a
tight
tan
head
that
contrasts
with
the
deep
obisdion
black
body
this
heavy
black
stout
pours
with
a
sticky
topped
mocha
head
the
aroma
is
strongly
of
dark
malt
with
hints
of
bitter
coffee
the
initial
flavor
is
of
roasted
popcorn
and
tossed
with
a
good
bit
of
dark
malt
underscored
by
smoky
chocolate
notes
all
balanced
by
a
smooth
bitterness
that
again
gives
way
to
a
roasted
finish
motoroil
black
with
a
monstrous
huge
darktan
head
big
aroma
with
deep
roasty
malt
some
chocolate
and
coffee
scents
and
something
like
rumsoakedraisins
a
fair
warning
of
whats
to
come
thick
chewy
creamy
body
heavy
on
the
malt
flavor
mostly
sweet
midpalate
with
more
chocolate
notes
and
something
like
maraschino
cherries
decent
hop
finish
the
aftertaste
is
roasty
and
pleasantly
biting
alcohol
warming
throughout
a
big
big
imperiallike
stout
id
definitely
drink
it
again
its
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
and
coffee
with
a
trace
of
chocolate
just
a
bit
of
hop
twang
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
to
compliment
the
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
its
just
to
the
light
side
of
the
light
to
thick
continuum
of
stout
its
good
stuff
san
quentins
breakout
stout
easily
escaped
from
my
glass
poured
so
dark
you
might
think
it
was
black
but
it
poured
a
thick
and
very
dark
brown
with
a
brown
foam
that
disapated
in
a
short
time
and
very
little
lace
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
and
coffee
was
outstanding
and
the
taste
was
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
sweetness
or
bitterness
in
this
beer
is
not
overpowering
but
a
well
balanced
and
complex
stout
that
is
pleasant
to
drink
had
this
stout
with
lunch
at
the
marin
brewing
co
which
incidentally
is
right
near
the
infamous
prison
very
roasted
nose
and
taste
not
much
head
and
lace
was
sparse
good
taste
though
and
i
enjoyed
this
stout
on
a
beautiful
fall
day
with
my
beautiful
lady
this
could
be
one
of
my
new
all
time
favorites
pours
a
nice
deep
black
with
a
tan
head
settled
fast
and
looked
a
little
oily
nice
subtle
chocolate
smell
with
some
roasted
barley
this
is
the
stout
worth
looking
for
blows
away
the
other
american
brewed
stouts
very
balanced
some
hops
the
chocolate
taste
is
perfect
not
to
bitter
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
unbelivable
taste
cool
bottle
too
won
too
many
medals
to
list
here
go
get
a
bottle
now
sickeningly
sweet
overcarbonated
and
way
too
thin
to
be
enjoyed
by
this
stout
enthusiast
chocolaty
nose
thick
black
stout
with
a
definite
feel
of
the
sweet
grape
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
good
finish
well
integrated
fits
with
the
beer
wow
this
is
awesome
stuff
i
just
love
the
grape
finish
on
this
a
creamy
sweet
stout
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
but
the
grape
juice
wasnt
overpowering
it
complemented
the
roasted
notes
quite
well
worth
checking
out
poured
into
a
stone
flute
pours
nearly
black
with
a
fine
one
finger
dark
khaki
head
with
good
retention
and
nice
lacing
aroma
of
dark
chocolate
toasted
malt
plums
hint
of
coffee
and
oak
flavor
of
charred
dark
malt
dark
chocolate
coffee
woody
oak
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
finishes
with
more
charry
malt
light
hop
bitterness
and
coffee
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
a
richly
flavored
charred
malt
stout
with
light
barrel
character
and
a
deftly
handled
fruit
component
it
tasted
like
plum
juice
but
must
be
from
the
dark
grapes
deceptively
straightforward
at
first
taste
but
develops
a
nice
range
of
complex
fruit
and
toasted
malt
character
this
was
very
good
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
beers
from
this
brewery
nicely
done
serving
type
on
tap
a
pleasantly
quaffable
foreign
stout
the
wood
and
wine
grape
treatment
adding
a
further
bit
of
zest
but
not
overstepping
their
bounds
at
any
time
heady
hearty
and
wholly
unworthy
of
this
gentile
fall
weather
were
enduring
at
the
moment
maybe
i
should
have
saved
this
one
for
a
few
months
o
i
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
i
thought
i
would
im
typically
not
a
fan
of
grapey
tasting
stouts
so
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
here
the
grape
adds
a
wonderful
accent
and
acts
more
as
a
binding
agent
than
anything
else
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
o
an
innovative
offering
of
the
style
with
the
malbec
grape
juice
and
oak
aging
pair
with
grilled
and
roasted
dark
meats
purple
beats
eggplant
berries
raw
shellfish
chocolate
cakes
and
puddings
white
cheeses
but
maybe
not
bleu
or
feta
overall
of
the
seasonal
stouts
i
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
the
body
of
this
beer
is
just
right
and
hits
the
spot
either
on
a
cold
winter
night
or
on
a
mild
sunny
latewinter
afternoon
here
in
colorado
great
decision
for
their
hibernal
beer
o
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
myself
having
one
to
two
of
these
in
an
evening
and
finding
it
quite
pleasant
i
like
the
mixture
of
the
wine
grapes
and
the
stout
flavors
and
aromas
with
a
nice
note
of
the
oak
barrels
from
aging
well
done
and
i
will
probably
grab
another
couple
of
these
the
next
time
i
see
them
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
medium
to
full
body
is
surprisingly
drinkable
good
job
ska
ive
yet
to
have
one
of
your
beers
that
i
didnt
like
poured
from
a
can
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
pours
a
thick
viscous
jet
black
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
clingy
light
tan
head
aromas
of
roast
cream
peat
earth
wood
and
subtle
char
very
well
blended
and
balanced
aromas
flavors
are
roast
and
creamy
forward
with
a
tart
and
sweet
grape
note
ribboning
throughout
very
unique
and
balanced
subtle
chocolate
notes
in
the
background
with
hints
of
smoke
and
char
throughout
touches
of
bitter
coffee
too
smooth
and
robust
in
mouth
with
a
bitter
and
roasted
aftertaste
of
bakers
chocolate
and
booze
the
finish
is
smooth
with
a
subtle
bitter
and
rich
linger
this
is
a
big
beer
and
a
very
unique
twist
on
the
style
tasty
overall
this
was
one
of
the
best
foreignexport
stouts
that
ive
had
i
will
definitely
be
stocking
the
fridge
home
tasting
12oz
can
into
snifter
21914
o
very
nice
altogether
i
usually
dont
like
ska
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
stout
that
has
a
nice
little
twist
with
the
grape
well
played
by
ska
o
a
good
try
although
i
feel
like
they
shouldve
gone
more
extreme
with
the
base
beer
if
they
were
going
to
age
it
on
oak
maybe
use
more
grape
juice
instead
whats
left
is
an
aboveaverage
stout
that
you
wouldnt
know
saw
any
time
in
a
barrel
skas
hoppier
less
malty
offerings
are
definitely
more
where
its
at
overall
overall
this
is
an
excellent
imperial
stout
i
dont
pick
up
any
of
the
malbec
grape
juice
but
i
think
thats
a
good
thing
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
overall
great
nose
and
good
flavor
body
quite
light
o
4
00
its
somewhere
between
a
belgian
stout
and
an
imperial
stout
i
like
it
its
a
little
light
bodied
but
thats
probably
due
to
the
grape
juice
drying
it
out
o
tasty
and
rich
in
moderation
too
many
may
become
too
much
great
and
interesting
beer
though
another
beer
from
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grapes
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
coffee
taste
is
lots
of
roasted
malts
some
coffee
a
bit
of
grapes
a
touch
of
hops
somewhat
complex
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
o
a
good
stout
i
will
get
it
again
yet
not
anytime
soon
the
crack
was
followed
by
an
inverted
glug
which
produced
both
a
pseudocascading
action
as
well
as
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
deeptan
head
with
great
retention
as
the
head
began
to
fall
lacing
began
to
form
almost
immediately
in
pouring
it
i
could
see
that
the
color
was
a
purplishbrown
like
a
really
bad
bruise
once
in
the
glass
however
it
was
allowing
zero
light
penetration
nose
smelled
of
raisins
and
chocolate
and
i
was
instantly
reminded
of
a
cadbury
fruit
nut
chocolate
bar
wild
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
i
am
going
to
go
out
on
a
limb
here
and
declare
the
taste
as
vinous
call
me
crazy
all
joking
aside
the
grapiness
was
immediately
evident
with
a
kind
of
sourtart
flavor
followed
by
a
smoky
chocolatiness
the
finish
was
semidry
and
i
was
reminded
of
the
homemade
wine
that
my
uncle
makes
especially
the
zinfandel
in
1989
wow
what
wont
they
think
of
next
this
was
totally
unexpected
and
quite
the
drink
one
would
be
plenty
for
me
but
for
the
vino
crowd
this
could
be
a
bridge
a
dryish
tasting
rich
and
worthy
drink
a
nice
stout
better
fresh
than
with
a
few
months
age
on
it
got
more
wine
out
of
the
first
few
cans
cant
wait
for
the
next
ska
seasonal
stout
impressive
stout
plenty
going
on
plenty
that
could
go
wrong
fortunately
it
doesnt
really
interesting
beer
and
worth
trying
thanks
dan
for
the
opportunity
o
quite
a
delicious
brew
all
the
qualities
of
a
good
stout
with
an
added
winelike
flavorfeel
twist
very
skillfully
employed
smell
really
popped
and
flavor
had
many
dimensions
d
hides
its
abv
well
and
is
built
well
im
surprised
at
this
one
with
some
work
it
could
be
great
o
a
solid
stout
with
a
nice
little
tart
kick
glad
to
have
tried
it
o
the
smell
of
this
got
me
excited
but
the
taste
was
like
a
strong
stout
good
just
not
what
i
expected
overall
an
interesting
fruity
roasty
foreign
export
stout
i
think
this
is
a
more
interesting
approach
to
the
beers
of
the
future
the
flavoring
is
appropriate
and
the
brew
has
a
distinctly
beery
character
but
its
a
little
different
on
the
creative
side
i
just
had
a
dfh
noble
rot
so
its
from
the
white
wine
to
the
red
pours
a
black
color
good
retention
and
great
lacing
14
inch
head
of
a
tan
color
smells
of
roasted
malt
slight
sweet
malt
grape
slight
coffee
and
a
hint
of
hop
fits
the
style
of
a
foreign
export
stout
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
also
a
slight
dryness
and
an
associated
thickness
tastes
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
grape
hint
of
coffee
and
slight
hop
overall
good
appearance
and
decent
aroma
body
and
feel
enjoyable
easydrinking
though
it
wasnt
quite
as
interesting
as
i
had
hoped
given
the
addition
of
grapes
glad
i
just
picked
up
a
single
worth
a
try
though
a
solid
export
stout
the
grape
juice
brings
some
drynessacidity
to
the
party
thats
about
it
from
what
i
can
see
abv
is
fairly
well
hidden
drinks
fairly
easy

another
intriguing
canned
stout
from
ska
lets
give
it
a
try
poured
into
snifter
pour
is
black
medium
visual
weight
with
a
collar
of
tan
head
moderate
amount
of
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
has
that
nice
roasty
foreign
stout
character
that
emphasizes
roasted
barley
and
black
patent
the
malbec
grape
character
integrates
nicely
with
the
sweet
malt
components
of
the
aroma
a
bit
of
oak
is
present
as
well
which
gives
off
a
somewhat
dry
aroma
the
taste
starts
with
grape
sweetness
that
presents
itself
delicately
i
was
concerned
that
this
brew
would
be
a
sweet
mess
given
the
ingredients
the
grape
lends
nicely
to
the
sturdy
roast
of
the
base
very
nice
balance
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
oak
come
through
with
hints
of
white
grape
juice
throughout
the
grape
quality
makes
one
last
appearance
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
very
unique
and
well
executed
at
10
99
a
six
pack
it
also
offers
a
good
value
worth
a
try
od
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
stout
i
cant
argue
about
the
taste
although
im
not
sure
how
much
it
incorporates
the
uniqueness
they
were
aiming
for
worth
a
try
o
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
grape
was
more
outstanding
so
it
could
compliment
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
malt
i
find
this
to
be
an
exquisite
little
foreign
export
stout
its
packed
with
flavor
and
character
all
wrapped
up
in
a
deliciously
sweet
and
heavy
body
im
not
sure
what
the
malbec
grapes
added
to
this
little
beauty
but
but
all
the
other
ingredients
sure
come
together
wonderfully
if
a
big
roasty
mealinacan
stout
is
what
youre
after
this
one
easily
fits
the
bill
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
stout
i
really
like
this
series
of
stouts
from
ska
drinkin
a
beer
with
malbec
grapes
watching
a
documentary
that
mentions
baalbek
nice
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
murky
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
dusty
cocoa
powder
light
oak
and
a
vague
sense
of
flavored
alcohol
as
though
i
sniffed
a
solo
cup
left
over
from
some
random
college
party
where
they
were
drinking
whoknows
what
in
these
cheapass
vessels
the
taste
rings
with
a
sharp
red
wine
grape
covered
in
cocoa
and
mild
coffee
hints
of
vanilla
bean
and
oak
dart
in
and
out
at
various
points
though
a
bit
of
booziness
pervades
it
doesnt
wholly
interfere
with
things
rather
opting
to
occasionally
create
a
sense
of
cough
syrup
every
now
and
again
somehow
this
jumble
works
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
verging
on
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
nice
stout
one
that
blends
the
wine
grapes
well
with
the
roasty
surroundings
d
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
and
id
be
willing
to
pick
up
a
4pack
to
see
how
it
compares
out
of
the
can
interesting
and
unique
beer
i
dug
their
merlot
stout
and
this
was
in
a
similar
vein
i
can
imagine
this
might
be
a
bit
polarizing
but
it
worked
for
my
palate
happily
consumed
12oz
and
could
drink
a
couple
in
an
evening
the
hiberdal
vinifera
stout
is
good
the
stout
poured
an
opaque
dark
in
my
sniffer
there
is
a
thin
tan
head
which
is
leaving
some
lace
the
scent
is
bolstered
by
espresso
with
touches
subtle
hints
of
red
wine
the
taste
is
starts
with
a
typical
stout
roasts
earthy
espresso
etc
then
the
finish
has
a
dark
fruitblack
cherry
tones
the
malbec
presence
becomes
more
pronounced
as
the
beer
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
very
interesting
stout
and
a
perfect
winter
warmer
overall
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
and
i
dont
think
ill
be
getting
through
the
sixer
anytime
soon
almost
like
a
wine
a
great
brew
for
those
that
say
its
boring
and
undefined
compare
it
sidebyside
to
skas
milk
stout
youll
see
this
brew
is
a
home
run
a
must
try
well
done
ska
my
take
a
meal
in
a
can
kind
of
beer
somewhat
complex
with
a
thick
dripdowntheesophagus
feel
attendant
to
the
style
and
a
lingering
mouth
presence
it
should
not
be
sessioned
or
taken
with
dinner
i
might
grab
some
sharp
cheddar
for
my
next
gulp
feels
a
bit
dry
but
also
smooth
this
is
an
easy
drinking
stout
12oz
can
purchased
for
2
i
think
made
sure
to
buy
a
single
because
i
bought
a
sixer
of
the
last
cocoa
stout
ska
did
and
was
unhappy
dark
black
color
nice
head
good
stout
appearance
nice
roasted
stout
smell
sort
of
rich
nice
flavor
was
more
rich
stout
hints
of
cocoa
not
a
trace
of
grapes
that
my
palate
could
detect
i
could
also
not
detect
any
oak
but
i
wasnt
let
down
because
it
was
still
a
tasty
stout
a
real
strange
installment
of
the
stout
series
aged
in
oak
with
malbec
grape
juice
added
the
pour
looks
alright
jet
black
and
thicker
with
an
inch
of
tan
head
with
nice
retention
maybe
im
seeing
what
i
want
to
see
here
but
there
appears
to
be
a
faint
purple
color
to
it
when
held
to
the
light
the
smell
is
of
a
sweet
stout
maybe
not
quite
a
milk
stout
but
there
is
plenty
of
residual
sugar
in
this
one
as
well
as
a
sturdy
but
not
too
black
roasty
malt
base
the
grape
juice
can
hardly
be
smelled
or
tasted
it
just
tastes
like
a
sweet
stout
to
me
i
dont
even
get
much
oak
i
get
a
hint
of
grapey
acidity
towards
the
end
but
thats
about
it
its
got
a
strange
aftertaste
of
fruit
which
i
think
clashes
with
the
large
dark
malt
profile
rather
than
adding
anything
desirable
full
body
and
a
very
funny
feeling
beer
in
the
stomach
im
glad
i
got
a
single
instead
of
a
6pack
as
this
is
not
as
easy
beer
to
put
down
i
dont
dislike
it
but
i
dont
think
it
came
together
quite
the
way
it
was
intended
to
maybe
more
time
in
oak
would
bring
the
flavors
together
in
a
more
congruent
way
or
maybe
they
should
just
scrap
this
and
go
back
to
the
mole
stout
because
that
was
darn
good
o
overall
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
that
hits
on
multiple
flavor
notes
without
seeming
like
its
trying
too
hard
the
grapeoakcoffee
stout
is
surprisingly
balanced
and
extremely
tasty
at
8
these
flavors
hide
the
alcohol
entirely
i
could
session
this
badboy
o
very
tasty
i
suspect
the
grape
juice
might
have
helped
with
the
sweetness
that
i
tasted
that
complemented
the
coffee
notes
the
oak
was
more
noticed
as
i
first
tried
it
i
liked
this
beer
the
only
thing
i
wish
ska
had
dont
was
not
about
the
beer
but
their
website
they
teased
about
info
about
the
beer
but
i
followed
every
link
i
could
and
couldnt
find
anything
about
it
a
decent
brew
with
a
solid
porter
character
but
seems
to
be
hard
to
discern
style
or
one
that
seems
distinct

i
really
enjoyed
this
one
definitely
recommended
at
the
birch

in
norfolk
they
have
it
on

if
you
like
imperial
stouts
drink
this
the
licorice
is
not
a
overpowering
flavor
it
sit
in

to
darken
the

and
strengthen
the
imperial
presents
dont
know
what
it
taste
like
from

just

is
alway

balanced
an
reserve
than
is
over
carbonated
cousin
enjoy
very

satisfying
complex
and
all
round
well
done
o
a
really

beer
very
flavorful
but
nothing
too
aggressive
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
bargain
at
15
kr
less
than

overall
a
very
nice
beer
more
foreign
export
stout
than
baltic
porter
but
having
elements
of
both
styles
that
has
a
range
of
subtle
flavors
well
it
was
soured
and
probably
a
bit
old
so
take
my
opinions
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
its
a
porter
so
it
should
survive
although
an
08
if
it
was
one
would
be
pushing
it
and
the
infection
wouldve
been
present
if
subdued
at
time
of
bottling
o
overall
very
enjoyable
i
like
the
dark
chocolate
flavors
mixing
with
a
touch
of
licorice
very
nice
needs
to
go
under
another
style
like
many
beers
misidentified
in
the
baltic
porter
style
a
good
export
stout
from
denmark
o
true
to
style
beer
nothing
special
or
unique
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
o
nice
beer
true
to

not
overbearing
in
any
way
at
all
no
gaps
or
issues
with
this
at
all
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
a
lot
of
character
to
this
would
try
this
again
if
got
the
chance

this

a
very
very
nice

like

this
beer
is
like
a
cross
between

two
of
my
very
favorite
styles
i
like
it
a
lot
i
could
easily
imagine
drink
several
of
these
sitting
around
a
campfire
with
the

the

rather
standard
artisan
baltic

that
ive
run

the

and
the

is
lighter
than
it
should
be
but
somehow
gives
the
impression
of
bigness
quite
easy
to
drink
and
very
assertive
with
its
long
roasted
finish
but
it
is
a
bit

punchy

look
it
has
a
huge
aroma

it
smells
like
a

its
medium

a

the

didnt

anything
about

probably
guess
this
as
a
smoked
baltic
porter
its
very
unique
lately
i
have
been
on

i
dont
like

i
dont
like

i
really
like
this
beer
ive
had
this
style
of
porter
from
just
about
every
country
in
eastern
and
northern
europe
and
this
danish
example
fairs
very
well
in
comparison
with
its
compatriots
while
there
are
better
examples
out
there
to
be
sure
thisted
bryghus
version
is
worth
laying
some
dough
on
this
is
definitely
one
that
ill
be
picking
up
if
i
ever
do
come
across
it
again

ma
this
isnt
stunning
but
unique
enough
to
give
it
a
shot
super
easy
to
drink
stout
drinkability
quite
decent
but
i
think
this
ones
quite
over
rated
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
you
could
either
sip
it
if
you
want
to
appreciate
the
flavors
or
drink
it
quickly
because
the
alcohol
is
very
well
masked
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
the
style
and
the
mild
spices
give
it
another
added
layer
worth
a
shot
d
would
get
this
again
and
again
almost
a
rausch
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
but
found
it
was
just
a
bit
of
a
let
down
that
a
pretty
beer
like
this
just
didnt
deliver
a
knockout
flavor
im
a
big
fan
of
scandinavian
beers
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
wellbalanced
and
quite
tasty
this
is
a
very
good
beer
it
is
highly
unique
for
the
baltic
porter
style
it
is
more
of
an
american
styled
porter
it
is
sweet
and
decadent
but
perhaps
not
so
much
as
the
common
baltic
porter
but
it
is
a
nice
balanced
imperial
style
porter
worth
picking
up
overall

d
an
incredibly
drinkable
baltic
porter
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
be
it
a
stout
or
a
porter
this
was
a
great
beer
i
will
definitely
pick
up
some
more
of
these
the
taste
wont
disappoint
there
are
lots
of
smoked
and
peaty
flavors
to
this
beer
almost
mossy
in
taste
but
quite
good
there
is
lots
of
molasses
brown
sugars
charred
notes
slightly
cherry
dark
chocolate
and
loads
of
sweet
malts
this
is
a
very
complex
and
full
palated
beer
it
has
warming
alcohol
notes
a
touch
of
abv
in
the
throat
some
drying
and
hop
notes
towards
the
finish
to
balance
this
out
this
is
a
very
full
bodied
beer
a
very
thick
pour
with
a
very
oily
coating
on
the
tongue
the
aftertaste
is
pronounced
but
the
charred
flavors
dont
linger
longer
than
they
need
to
this
beer
is
well
worth
seeking
out
this
is
a
special
beer
lchaim
i
wish
i
had
grabbed
a
couple
of
these
as
this
is
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
almost
like
velvet
as
crosses
the
palate
and
reaches
the
throat
very
happy
with
this
offering

thanks

to

toasted

yummy
beer
all
around
nicely
complimented
my
bananas
foster
dessert
yum
an
interesting
brew
that
is
labeled
both
as
a
double
brown
stout
and
porter
which
is
it
a
mix
of
strong
brown
stout
and
baltic
porter
ild
say
and
one
that
works
well
an
interesting
flavourful
beer
drinkability
very
drinkable
surprisingly
so
given
the
high
alcohol
content
the
taste
is
unbelievably
smooth
with
a
smoked
and
dark
malt
character
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
are
in
the
back
ground
the
mouth
feel
is
great
with
a
nice
smooth
ice
cream
coating
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
good
porter
i
think
i
might
liike
sinebyrchoff
better
purely
on
taste
but
appearance
mouth
feel
are
top
notch
on
this
one
overall
a
very
nice
beer
baltic
porter
has
never
been
a
favorite
of
mine
but
this
is
a
beer
i
would
buy
repeatedly
d
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
when
the
label
says
both
double
brown
stout
and
porter
i
thought
this
was
interesting
and
enjoyed
the
spice
and
the
smokiness
okay
i
like
most
flavors
in
beer
but
the
one
direction
i
dont
like
is
bandaid
this
beer
is
rife
with
it
like
a
few
belgians
that
exhibit
this
flavor
this
seems
intentional
instead
of
an
infection
unlike
those
particular
belgian
beers
this
one
seems
more
an
accident
of
combined
flavors
than
the
result
of
any
funkiness
im
a
huge
licorice
fan
and
i
like
some
peat
in
the
glass
as
well
but
the
combination
here
of
the
strong
licorice
and
strong
peat
here
tastes
just
like
bandaid
to
me
here
and
i
dont
like
it
at
all
i
could
be
wrong
and
it
could
just
be
infected
but
this
is
not
a
bottle
thats
been
lingering
on
a
shelf
somewhere
the
abv
is
relatively
high
and
there
is
no
excuse
for
it
and
ill
judge
accordingly
the
pour
is
nice
black
and
viscous
with
a
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
ring
that
viscosity
though
is
a
little
unsettling
in
the
mouth
very
thick
and
almost
slick
in
the
mouth
the
smell
has
a
bit
of
that
bandaid
smell
that
grows
as
it
warms
beyond
that
roasty
very
peaty
and
licorice
dominate
the
taste
has
that
same
flavor
especially
on
the
finish
before
that
is
some
very
earthy
licorice
and
strong
peat
and
then
tragedy
i
wont
be
having
this
again
for
a
smoke
beer
extra
points
for
the
fact
that
after
i
finished
this
beer
i
really
really
wanted
another
top
notch
overall
really
solid
but
nothing
out
of
the
universe
would
have
no
trouble
revisiting
this
brew
bottle
at
home
deep
black
no
head
deep
roast
chocolate
and
toasted
malts
over
fizzzy
smooth
toasted
roast
malts
little
sweetness
quite
a
bit
of
chocolate
gentle
bitterness
medium
carbonation
medium
body
pretty
decent
i
think
this
is
really
a
smoked
porter
or
damn
close
to
it
it
deserves
to
be
sipped
at
close
to
room
temperature
allowing
you
to
enjoy
the
full
complexity
of
this
beer
ill
have
to
remind
myself
to
get
more
of
this
fine
brew
at
my
next
visit
to
denmark
nicely
done
beer
if
you
like
the
flavor
of
a
good
specialty
coffee
you
will
like
this
beer
this
beer
pours
be
careful
black
with
brown
head
that
will
last
the
smell
is
of
toasty
hops
this
is
definitely
a
stout
porter
the
7
8
is
most
noticeable
in
the
aroma
which
is
sweet
and
mainly
of
the
malt
the
taste
is
smooth
and
complex
with
a
very
pleasing
aftertaste
that
is
worth
a
trip
to
denmark
this
has
a
very
heavy
mouthfeel
that
lasts
and
for
that
reason
it
is
less
drinkable
than
a
light
lager
very
very
pleased
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
denmark
and
i
will
continue
to
bring
at
least
a
bottle
or
two
home
from
each
visit
if
i
can
a
very
danish
porter
or
a
double
brown
stout
as
they
call
it
lower
body
than
the
britishbaltic
version
more
bitterness
more
carbonation
and
more
alcohol
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
which
i
wish
we
could
get
around
here
smoky
ashy
aroma
is
a
mix
of
bbq
and
cigarette
butts
roasty
malts
beneath
that
but
i
dont
really
get
any
coffee
chocolate
raisin
prune
or
licorice
body
is
deep
black
with
a
bubbly

fluffy
two

not

just
not

bitter

flavor
that
includes
esspresso
and
bakers
chocolate

charred

burnt

the

different
but
not
something
im
enamored
with

i
cant

of
black

roasted

and
a
long
lingering
finish
of
coffee

and

quite
tasty
and
rare
i
am
glad
ungstrup
shared
this
with
me
this
bottle
that
i
am
drinking
is
two
weeks
from
being
one
year
old
it
has
a
pitch
black
colour
with
a
large
brownish
head
the
head
disappears
quickly
though
the
smell
is
smokey
and
malty
some
hints
of
licorice
and
alcohol
too
it
has
a
lovely
smokey
taste
malty
too
and
hints
of
coffee
and
licorice
the
aftertaste
leaves
you
with
a
long
smokeiness
in
your
mouth
you
can
not
taste
the
high
alcohol
in
this
beer
so
be
careful
when
drinking
it
i
have
found
a
new
favourite
beer
named
a
double
brown
stout
by
the
brewery
stout
and
porter
in
denmark
is
more
or
less
the
same
thing
this
is
indeed
a
robust
one
distinct
smoked
flavour
hints
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
liqourice
and
spices
maybe
an
aquired
taste
i
like
no
love
this
beer
more
every
time
i
drink
it
overall
moher
stout
fits
the
description
of
an
imperial
irish
stout
to
a
tee
it
delivers
on
huge
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
taste
yet
leaves
the
palate
dry
and
wanting
more
although
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
slightly
better
hidden
this
is
still
an
excellent

really

feel

than
it
should
have
if
you
like
a
really
dark
and
strong
beer
this
ones
for
you
i
personally
think
its
ok
i
dont
regret
trying
it
over
all
i
give
this
a
rating
of
3
the
taste
gets
better
after
a
few
sips
and
it
isnt
a
twist
tot
which
i
like
and
being
imported
from
jamaica
thats
the
main
purpose
why
i
tried
it
makes
it
worth
it
to
atleast
try
if
anything
a
large
mocha
head
rises
and
sits
top
this
ebony
bodied
liquid
with
the
top
a
darker
hue
it
looks
like
one
of
those
beefed
up
imperial
stouts
brewed
in
the
us
theres
joy
here
and
the
joy
is
coming
through
the
nose
a
very
sweet
note
of
chocolate
followed
with
booze
and
overripe
banana
the
taste
is
agreeable
interesting
to
say
the
least
it
has
a
banana
accent
which
gives
up
a
belgian
impression
but
isnt
soft
roasted
malts
taking
a
swim
in
chocolate
and
a
kiss
of
fruitiness
not
much
alcohol
is
noted
regarding
mouthfeel
its
mediumfull
bodied
with
a
carbonation
near
soda
level
lets
cut
that
down
some
as
it
stands
its
an
acceptable
foreign
stout
which
is
also
relatively
easy
on
the
wallet
not
so
refined
but
that
works
in
its
benefit
a
big
sweet
stout
that
wants
to
play
with
our
palates
we
wish
more
of
these
foreign
stouts
would
hit
our
shores
to
further
challenge
the
palates
of
us
beer
drinkers
if
the
locals
in
jamaica
have
no
problem
drinking
a
hearty
stout
in
85f
sunny
weather
then
neither
should
you
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
some
slight
dark
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
slightly
sour
bittersweet
cocoa
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
i
am
not
really
enjoying
the
sour
aspect
i
am
getting
in
the
flavor
o
the
7
6
abv
is
noticeable
not
a
bad
stout
from
a
country
that
i
mostly
associate
with
red
stripe
and
red
hair
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
more
traditional
european
or
more
creative
american
stouts
perfectly
acceptable
though
if
you
are
in
the
islands
and
tired
of
lager
enjoyable
stout
that
packs
a
punch
at
over
7
percent
nothing
amazing
but
still
worth
a
try
i
didnt
have
big
expectations
but
this
is
unique
and
pretty
tasty
worth
giving
a
toss
cheers
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
nicelybalanced
stout
full
of
excellent
flavors
and
obviously
the
result
of
careful
craftsmanship
the
beer
doesnt
necessarily
bring
anything
new
to
the
tableyes
there
are
fruity
notes
here
but
those
same
notes
are
found
in
other
stoutsbut
it
does
bring
all
of
the
flavors
together
excellently
nice
thick
feel
but
noticeable
carbonation
that
eases
as
it
warms
really
well
done
i
quite
like
this
served
chilled
in
a
bulb
a
descent
export
here
nothing
simple
about
this
beer
hops
come
through
nice
without
taking
away
the
other
flavors
exports
are
a
fun
style
with
odd
characteristics
this
would
be
really
good
in
the
winter
although
its
even
good
in
99
degree
weather
mmm
not
bad
not
quite
a
sweet
stout
and
drinkable
i
let
it
warm
a
tad
before
pouring
and
then
it
had
a
nice
thick
creamy
foamy
frothy
tan
head
that
mostly
faded
fast
and
a
little
lace
color
is
opaque
dark
brown
except
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
where
its
narrow
and
there
i
can
see
its
a
clear
garnet
aroma
isnt
too
complex
just
basically
what
id
expect
to
find
roasty
malt
toffee
cocoa
caramel
flavrors
more
or
less
the
same
with
a
little
sweetness
balance
by
the
roasty
burnt
and
carbonic
acids
body
is
good
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
balanced
too
with
a
little
booze
and
of
medium
length
a
slow
session
so
i
dont
get
wasted
o
a
very
interesting
and
good
stout
and
worth
a
try
for
any
stout
lover
a
quality
stout
from
jamaica
7

was

discernable
at
all

as
it

4
overall
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
i
can
feel
the
7
6
abv
from
this
beer
but
i
think
one
is
enough
for
one
sitting
of
this
complex
beer
drinkability
is
challenging
not
bad
flavors
of
coffee
dark
fruit
bitter
roast
and
a
slight
hint
of
alcohol
lightly
bitter
and
roasty
aftertaste
surprising
not
as
sweet
as
the
nose
let
on
a
little
thin
and
light
on
carbonation
but
its
decent
overall
probably
the
best
jamaican
beer
ive
had
d
my
perception
of
this
beer
is
that
its
has
the
profile
of
a
regular
american
stout
at
5
is
it
good
yes
is
it
the
beer
that
its
trying
to
be
unfortunately
no
one
hell
of
a
decent
strong
stout
smooth
silky
and
with
an
elevated
abv
that
is
not
at
all
noticeable
freakishly
good
good
stout
wish
it
was
slightly
more
malty
in
the
taste
but
otherwise
not
a

be

didnt
know
they
made
decent
stouts
in
jamaica
but
i
guess
thats
part
of
the
beer
drinking
journey
i
had
it
on
another
one
of
our
hot
humid
days
in
charleston
but
it
didnt
leave
me
feeling
bloated
to
me
thats
a
definite
plus
i
got
hints
of
chocolate
malt
and
candy
with
a
slight
hop
finish
taste
was
very
malty
almost
like
a
malted
milkshake
didnt
really
taste
much
hops
at
all
as
well
as
no
taste
of
alcohol
the
appearance
was
the
big
disappointment
though
not
much
of
a
head
at
all
just
kind
of
a
spotty
at
best
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
overall
this
beer
is
good
but
a
bit
thin
and
has
a
very
slight
astringency
on
the
finish
d
i
believe
that
this
could
be
an
all
night
brew
it
seems
funny
to
me
that
the
jamaican
style
stout
is
so
sweet
and
strongits
sustaining
and
warminggood

a

its

puzzled
by
the
style
though
the
body
was
full
and
satisfying
without
being
overly
heavy
drinkability
was
very
good
for
a
brew
of
this
size
and
strength
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
i
got
more
then
i
expected
from
jamaica
stout
with
out
doubt
im
not
saying
this
is
a
world
class
stout
but
its
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
worth
trying
for
sure
taste
similar
to
great
divides
yeti
stout
in
that
it
is
very
sweet
and
smooth
without
having
a
big
roasty
flavor
like
many
other
stouts
drinkability
above
average
and
way
above
what
i
expected
a
good
smelling
but
slightly
watery
and
too
sweet
import
stout
i
enjoyed
it
but
by
the
end
i
was
glad
i
would
not
be
having
another
right
away
again
more
coffee
in
this
one
but
it
didnt
develop
throughout
the
bottle
became
thinner
a
surpisingly
dense
beer
from
a
hot
climate
pretty
drinkable
stout
you
can
throw
back
a
few
of
these
without
feeling
weighed
down
overall
this
was
a
nice
surprise
its
nothing
earth
shattering
but
its
certainly
a
better
stout
than
i
thought
the
hot
climate
of
jamaica
could
come
up
with
worth
a
shot
solid
two
finger
head
of
rich
brown
creamy
foam
whipped
up
enough
to
quickly
dimple
admirable
stickiness
to
the
sheets
of
lacing
impenetrably
black
colored
liquid
sliver
of
copper
at
the
outer
edges
plays
up
the
roasted
coffee
cocoa
in
the
nose
licorice
too
yet
not
without
its
bitter
side
chicory
and
celery
more
chocolaty
as
it
sits
the
scents
seem
pressed
together
and
thus
you
dont
get
much
differentiation
among
them
fullbodied
and
close
to
formidably
dense
the
carbonation
slowly
builds
pops
and
then
builds
again
theres
a
thick
skinned
quality
to
the
dark
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
bean
flavors
so
robust
it
cant
help
but
express
itself
but
perhaps
in
a
begrudging
manner
syrupy
at
times
however
no
lack
of
hop
bite
and
theres
oats
pumpernickel
and
whole
grain
bread
aspects
ends
with
an
allusion
to
rum
or
maybe
thats
just
the
power
of
suggestion
given
its
place
of
origin
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
this
is
not
one
i
would
go
back
to
d
i
was
very
surprised
with
this
beer
at
how
good
it
was
so
far
the
imports
that
have
come
with
the
club
have
sucked
but
this
is
a
damn
good
stout
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
in
a
sitting
worth
finding
to
try
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
thin
brown
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
beer
developed
a
good
collar
that
remained
with
some
decent
laciness
aroma
is
coffee
and
malt
with
some
tones
of
alcohol
taste
was
coffee
and
a
little
malt
a
lot
of
bitterness
with
some
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
thick
and
viscous
mouthfeel
very
good
session
beer
that
does
not
sit
heavy
flavor
is
to
my
liking
but
may
be
on
the
bitter
side
for
others
d
this
is
a
tasty
foreign
extra
stout
and
i
think
fits
the
style
quite
well
its
skewed
a
little
towards
a
hop
flavor
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
silky
smooth
roasted
malt
dvery
tasty
well
done
stout
i
could
polish
off
a
few
of
these
but
beware
at
8
alcohol
this
is
not
a
session
stout
overall
this
is
a
winner
not
a
bad
taste
licorice
and
chocolate
with
a
black
cherry
aftertaste
says
its
7

abv
but
it
is
very
smooth
you
definitely
dont
notice
the
taste
drinkabilityoverall
surprisingly
tasty
and
balanced
for
a
random
jamaican
export
stout
the
baileys
in
the
nose
is
spot
on
and
the
taste
has
the
dark
fruits
and
char
that
i
like
in
the
style

straw

forgotten

as
bitterness
i
get
is
burnt
quiet
heavy
in

though
not
doing
bad
to
the

adding
some

still
bit
unfresh
for

quiet
