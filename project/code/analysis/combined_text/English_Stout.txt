i
dont
get
any
bourbon
unless
its
hidden
in
all
the
rest
of
the
sweetness
i
dont
get
much
oak
perhaps
a
touch
this
is
actually
a
very
tasty
beer
an
imperial
english
mild
ale
perhaps
but
a
bourbon
aged
stout
i
dont
get
it
still
i
would
definitely
reach
for
it
again
its
very
tasty
o
soso
a
decent
enough
beer
on
its
own
terms
but
doesnt
really
fulfill
expectations
for
a
bourbon
stout
looks
ok
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
quite
sweet
and
boozy
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
dried
fruit
stewed
leaves
and
woodiness
lacklustre
body
too
thin
the
malt
character
isnt
beefy
enough
to
match
the
aging
and
doesnt
provide
sufficient
balance
the
result
is
slightly
cloying
a
sort
of
light
bourbon
stout
drinkable
but
not
memorable
no
need
to
hunt
this
one
down
very
solid
and
accessible
i
will
definitely
grab
more
in
the
future
innis
gunn
bourbon
aged
stouts
flavor
immediately
leans
sweet
channeling
dates
caramel
toffee
and
touches
of
chocolate
there
are
boozy
touches
of
cooked
fruit
and
alcohol
soaked
oak
barrels
the
mouthfeel
ends
up
being
thick
between
the
sugary
nature
and
the
high
booze
the
elements
of
bourbon
tend
to
take
over
toward
the
end
giving
off
burnt
chocolate
caramelized
sugars
and
the
flavor
of
preserved
fruit
the
finish
goes
on
for
some
time
moving
closer
to
bourbon
as
it
goes
a
different
stout
thats
semi
transparent
and
easier
to
drink
than
others
serving
type
bottle
nicely
package
and
thats
about
where
it
ends
draws
no
comparisons
to
other
ba
stouts
offered
really
disappointed
i
found
this
to
be
a
really
well
done
bourbon
oakaged
stout
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
the
beer
that
introduced
me
to
innes
gunn
black
appearance
but
actually
deep
mahoghany
with
red
hues
when
backlit
with
a
lasting
but
frothy
tan
head
leaves
some
lacing
on
glass
aroma
of
bourbon
vanilla
and
charred
oak
tastes
of
malt
and
chocolate
with
lingering
bourbon
flavor
mouth
feel
has
slight
carbonation
bite
but
not
heavily
carbonated
not
as
smooth
as
many
stouts
o
overall
an
interesting
beer
it
is
certainly
a
reprieve
from
most
stouts
on
the
sweeter
side
but
not
offensively
cloying
the
smokey
character
makes
it
stands
out
and
is
really
enjoyable
id
drink
it
again
but
not
more
then
one
in
a
sitting
the
aftertaste
end
as
beer
began
smooth
with
a
presence
of
bourbon
just
enough
to
let
you
know
it
was
there
had
an
overly
sweet
caramel
taste
and
got
a
faint
metallic
smell
when
i
poured
it
like
the
smell
of
an
oily
coin
the
beer
itself
tasted
ok
however
the
weird
smell
and
sweetness
makes
this
a
not
so
good
beer
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
innis
gunn
beers
ive
had
and
would
happily
drink
again
odecent
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
as
the
molasses
seems
to
dominate
the
finish
almost
on
the
verge
of
drinking
flat
soda
or
a
watered
down
jack
and
coke
that
sat
out
for
a
while
and
went
flat
certainly
couldnt
drink
many
of
these
due
to
the
overly
sweet
flavors

bottom
line
would
i
buy
it
again
nah
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
it
a
7
4
abv
is
respectable
as
was
the
moderate
price
now
lets
see
how
long
its
available
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
example
of
bourbon
red
stout
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
red
stout
before
so
i
cant
be
too
sure
about
this
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it
lived
up
to
its
description
and
it
felt
like
it
was
somewhere
between
a
amber
ale
and
stout
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
crisp
slightly
cloying
a
little
sticky
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
full
bottle
might
be
just
a
little
too
much
for
because
of
the
sweetness
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
was
a
good
looking
beer
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
drinkability
i
just
think
the
sweetness
would
really
start
to
wear
on
me
after
awhile
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
dont
really
have
the
urge
to
revisit
it
anytime
soon
i
would
recommend
it
if
you
like
malty
english
ales
and
bourbon
aspects
in
your
beer
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
as
a
good
beer
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
from
this
brewery
it
falls
about
right
in
the
middle
and
the
same
goes
for
the
style
all
in
all
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
and
it
had
some
good
aspect
to
it
but
it
also
had
some
aspects
that
i
hurt
and
i
feel
like
i
could
go
either
way
with
this
beer
i
appreciate
the
effort
it
took
take
make
this
beer
and
i
hope
to
see
more
unique
beers
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
keep
up
the
solid
work
hardly
a
stout
this
is
like
a
way
too
sweet
and
syrupy
take
on
innis
and
gunn
rum
cask
avoid
this
beer
is
way
undervalued

bottom
of
the
box
the
beer
came
in
says
best
before
june
2015
not
sure
if
this
is
any
different
than
their
regular
bourbon
stout
but
the
box
says
this
is
a
limited
edition
beer
that
comes
from
a
select
batch
of
only
220
barrels
served
in
a
nonic
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
redbrown
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
tan
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
also
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
mostly
sweet
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
nuts
caramel
and
some
driedcandied
fruit
it
tastes
like
roasted
malt
nuts
dark
fruit
cola
and
also
has
an
herbalmineral
flavor
to
it
i
dont
really
pick
up
much
of
if
any
bourbon
at
all
i
know
its
weird
to
say
but
it
tastes
like
an
innis
gunn
beer
theres
just
something
about
the
beers
ive
tried
from
them
that
have
a
similar
taste
but
whatever
it
is
i
like
it
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
coating
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
its
also
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
i
liked
this
brew
but
maybe
they
should
have
aged
this
over
the
bourbon
oak
chips
longer
7
99
a
bottle
o
a
nice
and
different
take
on
a
bourbon
aged
stout
the
oak
chips
are
a
little
different
from
barrel
aging
but
still
impart
a
nice
bourbon
oak
and
vanilla
kick
ive
enjoyed
the
very
few
red
stouts
that
ive
had
and
this
is
no
exception
the
body
is
mediumfull
as
most
of
its
kind
tend
to
be
with
plenty
of
depth
and
a
good
smooth
flow
to
it
balanced
by
just
a
light
crisp
bite
its
got
a
little
bit
of
dryness
easing
in
to
keep
it
from
being
cloying
and
it
finishes
with
the
full
complexity
of
the
flavor
taste
is
very
sweet
and
not
in
a
pleasant
way
taste
like
mentioned
above
bad
caramel
or
a
disgusting
sweet
candy
subtle
hints
of
oak
but
not
brbn
light
to
lowmedium
feel
lingering
smokiness
that
doesnt
play
well
with
the
carbonation
overall
this
has
the
making
of
being
outstanding
imo
yet
the
water
and
the
malt
body
leaves
me
wanting
more
out
of
it
also
could
ask
for
more
oak
but
now
im
just
being
picky
there
is
qualities
i
like
about
this
brew
then
there
isnt
this
brew
has
more
of
a
noble
feel
where
every
thing
is
classy
and
refined
not
extreme
like
the
american
takes
on
styling
yet
i
dig
this
brew
gave
its
fair
shake
i
will
finish
my
bottle
this
brew
is
worthy
o
very
interesting
ale
a
red
stout
whose
malts
are
lighter
and
toastier
bourbon
aging
effects
a
honeyed
vanilla
character
of
sweetness
not
like
any
stouts
i
can
recall
one
of
a
kind
and
absolutely
worth
the
8
or
9
bucks
it
might
go
for
recommended
overall
a
tasty
beer
i
think
will
play
very
well
with
igs
customer
base
i
dont
think
this
beer
scores
well
as
a
stout
and
the
bourbon
character
is
pretty
muddled
bourbon
chip
irish
red
sure
ill
take
that
call
this
a
bourbon
stout
seems
to
me
more

to

also

with

the
taste
i
thought
was
very
good
starts
off
slightly

then
you
get

your

overall
good

not

i
would
rather
have
their
standard
brew
than
this
overall
if
this
beer
was
the
only
beer
on
tap
while
i
was
out
with
friends
i
simply
wouldnt
drink
overall
dont
expect
a
typical
bourbon
aged
stout
this
tastes
like
the
rest
of
the
innis
lineup
basically
its
a
decent
brew
and
another
beer
that
is
good
to
introduce
others
to
craft
very
unimpressive
as
were
the
other
two
beers
in
the
gift
box
o
ig
seem
to
have
a
slightly
differenct
view
of
stouts
and
porters
than
other
makers
perhaps
being
scottish
theirs
tend
to
be
more
scottish
alelike
this
is
no
exception
there
is
no
roasty
maltcoffeechocolatesmoke
flavor
to
speak
of
but
lots
of
bourbon
rather
reminiscent
of
alltechs
kentucky
ale
i
like
it
and
the
color
is
dark
enough
to
be
a
porter
or
stout
but
those
looking
for
more
heft
and
complexity
might
be
disappointed
horrid
brew
this
one
went
strait
down
the
drain
this
has
to
be
near
the
bottom
for
style
im
going
to
go
scrub
my
mouth
out
what
a
joke
of
a
bad

body
feels
watery
fairly
average
and

beer
to
me
if
im
honest
it
seemed
rather
plain
and
unadventurous
other
than
the
bourbon
coming
through

that
wasnt

o
a
very
nice
bourbon
stout
that
is
a
bit
sweet
but
very
tasty
this
beer
pours
a
deep
ruby
and
has
a
one
finger
head
that
surprsingly
sticks
around
for
quite
a
while
before
breaking
to
a
thin
film
leaving
no

in

wake
the

has
bourbon
treacle
malts
and
vanilla
the
mouth
feel
is
smooth
with
a
lower
than
expected
carbonation
overall
better
than
expected
i
quite
liked
this
and
would
revisit
it
and
recommend
it
to
others
same
evolving
flavors
of
dark
malts
chocolate
earth
and
bourbon
play
toss
and
catch
with
each
other
it
ended
with
a
slightly
lingering
chocolate
note
i
found
it
to
be
delightful
mo
smooth
on
the
palate
the
body
comes
rather
moderate
or
on
the
verge
of
being
light
at
times
but
given
the
moderate
flavour
profile
that
doesnt
go
heavy
on
malts
plus
alc
well
hidden
the
overall
balance
is
pretty
respectful
being
a
red
stout
oakaged
in
bourbon
casks
i
find
this
beer
very
enjoyable
and
would
certainly
recommend
it
amongst
most
other
innisgunns
products
ive
tasted
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
a
lovely
fullish
viscous
yet
vanishing
texture
the
beer
overall
caught
me
offguard
with
just
how
moreish
and
enjoyable
it
was
in
hindsight
i
can
say
i
am
relieved
that
this
wasnt
a
bourbonbomb
not
even
close
this
is
yet
another
satisfying
uniquely
distinctive
ale
from
innis
gunn
and
after
sampling
this
entire
set
i
am
sold
on
trying
more
of
their
products
their
beers
have
a
refined
characteristic
british
taste
to
them
which
is
right
up
my
alley
o
everything
about
this
beer
is
mediocre
except
the
taste
which
is
what
truly
matters
you
need
to
put
aside
your
american
stout
expectations
when
tackling
this
one
as
its
much
more
of
a
stoutscotch
ale
hybrid
when
it
comes
down
to
it
its
downright
delicious
im
amazed
at
how
long
the
mouth
feel
stays
solid
with
a
maltheavy
and
aged
stout
making
this
easy
to
drink
for
the
duration
of
the
session
another
new
one
for
me
and

is

with

and
overall
its
and
drinkable
where
the

easily
mingles
with

drink
it

of
flavour
everything
comes
back
to
that
malt
sweetness
which
i
am
long
past
being
an
apologist
for
i
thought
that
the
use
of
american
oak
in
whatever
respect
would
lend
this
the
air
of
an
american
stout
nope
still
english
the
hops
surprisingly
taking
care
of
that
a
bit
more
complex
than
i
was
expecting
but
thats
about
it
delicious
beer
one
of
the
best
whiskey
aged
beers
ive
drank
much
better
than
i
thought
subtle
oak
and
jamesons
flavor
not
boozy
at
all
for
fairly
high
abv
very
enjoyable
couldnt
see
more
than
onemaybe
2
at
a
sitting
great
offering
from
ig
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
like
sweet
stouts
and
the
irish
whiskey
aging
added
a
slight
complexity
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
enjoy
appearance
is
great
smell
is
offputting
mouthfeel
didnt
help
the
beer
at
all
might
be
better
on
nitro
or
cask
who
knows
robust
flavors
but
very
sweet
a
real
nice
and
light
flavorful
stout
perhaps
a
hair
sweet
but
nice
and
well
made
coffee
angle
not
very
obvious
to
me
as
suggested
by
the
makers
but
still
presents
a
solid
experience
pours
very
dark
no
noticeable
highlights
at
the
edges
just
black
mocha
colored
head
thins
out
to
a
wispy
cap
smells
of
raisins
roasted
malt
caramel
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
taste
begins
slightly
sweet
with
a
distinct
caramel
flavor
then
moves
to
chocolate
and
roast
with
a
mild
oak
and
alcohol
warmth
mouthfeel
and
body
is
a
little
thin
for
the
style
and
heat
it
brings
finishes
somewhat
sweet
d
not
bad
best
of
the
innis
and
gunn
cask
aged
beer
too
sweet
for
me
on
sight
innis
gunn
irish
whiskey
cask
is
a
deep
dark
brown
that
rests
just
short
of
black
it
ends
up
being
complete
opaque
with
no
light
getting
through
the
body
the
nose
has
a
hint
of
whiskey
pulling
in
hints
of
nuts
vanilla
sticky
toffee
dates
cooked
plums
espresso
and
chocolate
theres
a
fruitiness
to
the
elements
of
espresso
cigar
and
chocolate
on
the
palate
it
has
a
burned
malt
flavor
like
caramel
too
long
on
the
stove
but
channels
delicious
notes
of
caramel
espresso
dates
and
dark
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
heavy
thanks
to
the
alcohol
but
feels
somewhat
smooth
and
doesnt
get
hot
the
aftertaste
is
rather
short
but
channels
that
charred
wood
smoke
espresso
flavor
combination
with
a
hint
of
cacao
powder
not
much
here
its
ok
but
not
much
its
fine
tastes
nice
looks
nice
its
all
good
really
reminded
me
of
whiskey
and
cola
and
i
dont
like
that
so
i
scored
it
a
bit
lower
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
just
not
my
thing
very
nice
finish
for
a
stout
and
the
good
news
is
that
it
is
coming
out
of
retirement
should
be
available
the
second
week
of
january
overall
this
is
probably
my
favourite
stout
shame
it
is
only
brewed
in
small
batches
which
makes
it
hard
to
get
in
northern
ireland
although
that
does
make
the
pleasure
of
drinking
it
even
greater
as
i
always
know
it
is
a
limited
pleasure
my
advice
is
purchase
as
much
as
you
can
when
it
is
about
and
hide
it
away
in
the
cellar
for
special
occasions
on
second
thoughts
it
is
probably
a
good
job
this
is
only
brewed
in
small
batches
or
i
would
move
to
scotland
and
drink
the
lot
before
it
left
the
yard
but
maybe
that
is
just
the
ulster
scots
heritage
talking
330ml
bottle
deep
brown
colour
tall
frothy
beige
head
which
lasted
well
and
left
some
nice
lacing
gentle
aroma
of
whiskey
dark
fruits
caramel
and
sweet
malt
gentle
sweetness
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
develops
into
a
hint
of
bitterness
light
to
medium
palate
and
a
suggestion
of
alcoholic
warmth
not
aggressively
assertive
but
pleasant
and
drinkable
nonetheless
very
similar
to
their
rum
offerings
pretty
good
a
solid
take
on
the
style
looks
alright
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
rich
with
alcoholic
whiskey
and
dark
malt
character
body
is
a
shade
too
thin
a
decent
brew
the
only
problem
is
that
it
comes
across
as
overpolished
like
many
ig
beers
could
be
enhanced
by
bottle
conditioning
but
i
wont
hold
my
breath
that
said
its
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
pours
very
dark
with
a
decent
head
smells
pretty
good
smell
a
little
hint
of
whiskey
not
overpowering
tastes
pretty
good
less
stout
than
what
i
thought
it
would
from
the
appearance
just
like
the
smell
a
little
whiskey
aftertaste
i
like
this
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
o
solid
beer
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
still
good
overall
i
bet
this
is
outstanding
on
draft
would
be
a
great
st
pattys
day
brew
i
just
dont
under
stand
the
clear
bottle
on
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
think
it
could
be
more
a
very
nice
well
balanced
stout
with
a
hint
of
whiskey
in
the
background
o
an
excellent
variety
of
ig
cask
aged
brews
their
rum
cask
aged
is
one
of
my
top
gotos
for
flavor
when
i
want
beer
that
tastes
like
liquor
this
one
would
not
be
very
far
behind
in
fact
might
be
ahead
due
to
its
silky
mouthfeel

the

sticks
around

and
theres
a

is

the

i

it

well
with
the
stout

buy
this
again

a
4pack
overall
im
a
bit
underwhelmed
by
this
beer
and
i
can
tell
you
its
certainly
better
experienced
on
tap
that
said
you
could
do
worse
with
an
english
brown
ale
ahem
newcastle
final
grade

a
b
innis
gunns
irish
whiskey
cask
is
definitely
one
of
their
tastier
brews
and
at
3
25
a
bottle
its
absolutely
a
better
deal
than
many
of
their
other
rotating
offerings
im
looking
at
you
bottlesinacarton
im
not
sure
i
like
this
more
than
their
flagship
oaked
ale
but
id
be
happy
with
either
one
in
my
glass
worth
a
look
at
least
not
the
most
complex
woodaged
ale
by
any
means
but
a
good
affordable
tutorial
to
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
dark
brown
ruby
red
hue
dark
head
smell
has
some
faint
whiskey
but
the
flavor
has
a
lot
more
and
its
smooth
with
a
spicy
note
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
whiskey
i
enjoy
it
but
a
not
sessionable
for
me
and
b
needs
innis
glassware
regular
pint
glass
threw
off
balance
well
done
innes
gunn
o
not
overly
fussed
its
a
refreshing
style
porter
and
i
could
drink
more
however
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
concentration
of
flavours
in
the
taste
and
a
more
viscous
mouthfeel
nice
but
not
amazing
i
love
innis
and
gunn
it
was
the
first
beer
i
really
liked
and
got
me
into
good
beer
in
the
first
place
so
i
might
be
a
little
biased
the
color
is
a
very
dark
hazel
with
a
coffee
colored
head
that
has
some
legs
the
smell
is
toasty
but
you
can
smell
a
little
of
the
wood
too
the
taste
is
great
everything
ive
come
to
love
from
innis
and
gunn
smooth
rich
and
just
a
fantastically
crisp
finish
coats
your
mouth
but
doesnt
leave
a
lingering
aftertaste
absolutely
loved
it
and
would
definitely
recommend
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
and
terribly
pleasant
has
long
finish
just
like
irish
whiskey
and
hints
at
honey
the
clear
bottle
did
not
do
it
any
harm
as
far
as
i
can
tell
but
it
is
a
seasonal
so
i
bought
it
pretty
early
after
it
hit
the
shelf
o
im
an
ipa
guy
but
this
is
an
incredible
stout
i
might
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
drier
but
it
is
much
easier
to
have
a
sub5
beer
be
dry
than
a
7
4
beer
i
would
definitely
choose
this
over
guiness
though
as
it
it
everything
a
stout
should
be
and
has
some
great
oak
notes
as
well
taste
is
much
much
better
than
i
remember
the
others
i
tried
tasting
like
this
is
good
very
stoutlike
a
little
bit
of
chalkiness
some
bitter
chocolate
some
bourbonwhiskey
in
the
back
a
little
vanilla
and
not
thick
and
syrupy
like
so
many
other
stouts
barrelaged
or
not
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
preference
but
i
can
see
this
being
their
flagship
brew
wonder
why
it
took
so
long
for
total
wine
to
get
this
one
maybe
its
a
testament
to
which
brews
you
allow
to
age
in
a
barrel
the
rum
barreled
ones
really
sucked
i
thought
which
worries
me
about
the
bruerys
rum
barrel
black
tuesdays
coming
out
next
month
rum
does
rum
really
go
with
beer
but
this
one
does
good
but
overall
this
is
the
best
one
from
this
brewery
yet
overall
irish
whiskeys
usually
make
me
gag
but
this
one
aged
in
barrels
is
ok
still
i
prefer
cherry
wood
aged
because
i
love
sweetness
an
interesting
unique
wellbalanced
tasty
brew
it
grew
on
me
quickly
and
i
liked
it
more
the
more
it
progressed
pitch
black
with
small
tan
head
on
top
theres
no
retention
at
all
and
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
dark
roasted
malts
milk
chocolate
coffee
substantial
sweetness
on
the
nose
i
cant
seem
to
detect
any
whiskey
barrel
in
the
aroma
however
taste
is
sweet
maltiness
up
front
with
bittersweet
chocolate
now
you
can
taste
the
whiskey
although
its
not
as
forward
as
i
thought
it
might
be
there
are
bitter
malts
at
the
end
with
a
fairly
sweet
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
not
as
creamy
as
i
like
in
a
stout
this
is
a
decent
barrelaged
stout
but
i
think
it
couldve
benefited
with
more
time
in
the
whiskey
barrels
overall
one
of
the
best
products
ive
had
from
innis
gunn
and
im
a
pretty
big
fan
great
winter
beer
i
think
ill
enjoy
my
next
3
bottles
and
see
if
my
tastes
change
for
each
one
but
after
that
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
or
order
it
at
the
bar
really
well
put
together
the
oak
is
very
subtle
in
the
beer
and
really
only
lends
very
faint
background
notes
it
does
integrate
things
nicely
however
wonderful
balance
and
structure
overall
first
whiskey
caskaged
beer
i
have
had
and
it
hasnt
disappointed
a
very
nice
stout
thanks
to
innis
gunn
but
im
not
sure
there
was
enough
difference
or
added
flavour
from
the
cask
to
warrant
the
high
price
tag
since
it
is
over
au130140
a
case
2013
the
taste
has
plenty
of
sweet
malts
going
on
with
a
slightly
roasted
feel
too
overall
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
and
predictable
but
it
does
not
jump
out
as
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
hard
to
believe
that
this
was
7
40
abv
as
i
didnt
feel
woozy
until
i
had
nearly
polished
this
off
i
give
these
guys
credit
for
pushing
the
envelope
on
what
beer
can
be
and
for
making
me
realize
that
for
all
that
ive
enjoyed
over
the
years
that
theres
so
much
out
there
that
i
havent
tried
and
havent
had
access
to
such
as
this
style
it
almost
reminded
me
of
an
irish
dry
stout
crossed
with
a
milk
stout
but
this
was
wetter
and
less
sweet
and
most
of
all
completely
unoffensive
i
love
what
these
guys
are
capable
of
o
overall
this
beer
gets
better
and
better
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
so
do
not
serve
too
cold
the
ruby
tints
are
very
nice
in
a
stout
they
make
for
quite
a
nice
looking
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
high
note
creamy
feel
despite
having
less
body
than
the
american
stouts
im
used
to
taste
is
a
bit
high
on
alcohol
considering
its
only
7
4
and
the
whiskey
characteristics
dont
come
through
enough
for
me
the
cherry
bitter
chocolate
and
toffee
in
the
profile
are
enjoyable
decent
overall
but
i
wish
the
barrel
added
more
to
the
flavor
i
feel
the
burn
of
whiskey
but
dont
really
taste
it
od
a
very
good
and
interesting
beer
a
little
bit
filling
and
the
alcohol
is
fairly
high
but
manageable
not
overly
barrel
flavored
just
a
nice
compliment
this
is
an
interesting
stout
i
dont
believe
ive
every
had
a
scottish
stout
before
but
ive
certainly
had
my
share
of
irish
whiskeys
and
though
the
whiskey
notes
are
light
i
do
like
this
beer
it
is
my
second
innis
gunn
beer
and
ive
enjoyed
both
of
them
if
you
are
looking
for
a
interesting
european
barrelaged
beer
id
go
looking
for
this
one
bottle
poured
a
dark
brown
color
ale
with
a
medium
dirty
brown
color
head
with
medium
retention
and
light
lacing
notes
aroma
is
dominated
by
sweet
caramelized
notes
with
light
whiskey
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
caramelized
notes
with
a
light
whiskey
touch
which
kind
of
round
of
the
edges
of
the
beer
body
is
light
with
medium
creamy
texture
and
good
carbonation
a
bit
of
a
lighter
profile
then
i
had
expected
with
not
as
much
whiskey
notes
as
expected
overall
this
beer
is
good
found
this
beer
out
last
weekend
and
happy
yo
have
scored
a
bottle
will
be
enjoying
more
of
thus
in
the
future
o
a
good
beer
that
really
opens
up
as
it
gets
warmer
and
the
flavors
from
the
casks
become
much
more
prominent
o
a
solid
dry
irish
stout
base
makes
for
a
solid
choice
to
go
in
irish
whiskey
barrels
definitely
has
more
flavor
than
most
dry
irish
stouts
and
the
barrel
adds
another
nice
dimension
a
solid
choice
for
an
intro
to
ba
beers
as
it
doesnt
impart
too
much
booziness
but
the
flavors
are
still
there
solid
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
vanilla
and
some
woody
aromas
there
is
also
a
slight
metallic
aroma
that
comes
out
more
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
vanilla
and
woody
flavors
on
the
finish
a
smoke
flavor
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
up
there
is
a
vanilla
sweetness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
am
not
really
getting
any
distinct
whiskey
aromas
or
flavors
from
this
one
a
clear
extra
dark
cola
with
a
healthy
dollop
of
lace
on
top
and
clinging
to
the
sides
no
real
activity
smell
is
sweet
with
mild
molasses
and
malt
a
faint
whiskey
presence
coffee
coaco
and
bread
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
smooth
character
that
harkens
back
to
the
porter
roots
of
an
english
stout
lots
of
molasses
and
malt
finish
is
mildly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
whiskey
that
gives
a
mild
oak
and
vanilla
flourish
feel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
crisp
mild
carbonation
a
good
easy
drinking
brew
not
earth
shaking
but
solid
and
enjoyable
o
overall
a
really
nice
stout
ive
been
underwhelmed
by
their
original
scotch
ale
and
did
not
like
their
rum
cask
wee
heavy
but
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
lots
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
to
it
and
easy
to
drink
no
real
whiskey
to
it
but
its
still
good
would
like
to
have
it
again
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
although
it
is
still
fairly
lackluster
it
is
a
decent
stout
but
definitely
not
worth
the
steep
price
tag
o
another
hit
from
innis
gunn
solid
flavour
profile
with
a
huge
smoke
and
peaty
notes
definitely
a
worthy
brew
and
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
i
fail
to
see
the
connection
between
this
beer
and
irish
whiskey
and
aside
from
the
former
spending
60
days
in
casks
that
formerly
held
the
latter
there
is
indeed
no
connection
innis
gunn
doesnt
reveal
the
source
of
their
casks
theres
a
tremendous
difference
in
flavour
and
quality
between
an
irish
whiskey
like
bushmills
and
say
redbreast
let
alone
the
age
of
those
casks
and
their
former
contents
whatever
was
actually
used
i
recommend
switching
it
up
essentially
just
an
average
stout
buffed
up
a
bit
with
a
nice
touch
of
whiskey
drinkable
an
overall
good
irish
whiskey
cask
its
a
dark
beer
that
lacks
the
full
bodied
taste
and
texture
if
you
are
looking
for
a
sweet
after
taste
this
one
is
good
for
you
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
a
knock
your
socks
off
beer
id
order
it
again
for
a
light
bodied
and
flavored
dark
beer
probably
a
good
option
for
a
summer
day
from
a
clear
bottle
this
beer
is
nicely
attractive
dark
with
a
velvet
tan
head
and
a
lot
of
lace
the
smell
is
intreguing
roasted
grain
wood
and
charcoal
a
bit
of
smoke
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
expected
and
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
it
is
certainly
an
english
stout
rounded
welcoming
and
tasty
all
n
all
this
is
quite
good
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
slightly
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
flavorful
stout
worth
drinking
for
while
o
this
beer
is
a
deft
balancing
act
malt
hop
and
barrel
all
complement
each
other
nicely
and
yield
a
product
that
is
perhaps
more
drinkable
than
expected
its
the
kind
of
beer
that
speaks
softly
but
has
a
lot
to
say
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
o
this
is
a
great
stout
and
dangerous
because
the
7
4
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
through
the
flavours
o
it
was
good
i
feel
like
it
would
have
benefitted
from
a
bit
of
a
heavier
mouthfeel
though
medium
body
wish
it
was
a
bit
fuller
soft
carbonation
helps
things
out
alcohol
is
well
hidden
simple
beer
with
a
hint
of
complexity
i
enjoy
these
beers
from
ig
very
much
innis
and
gunn
irish
whiskey
cask
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
full
of
sweet
malt
from
the
whiskey
cask
along
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
chocolate
from
the
stout
the
aroma
is
a
little
poorly
integrated
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
with
smooth
oak
and
whiskey
tones
over
a
generic
yet
solid
english
stout
dry
roast
the
mouthfeel
is
light
for
the
style
and
gently
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
great
overall
this
is
another
solid
beer
from
innis
and
gunn
they
seem
to
have
a
thing
going
on
where
they
make
complex
yet
delicate
sipping
beers
im
all
for
it
o
a
good
brew
well
balanced
i
think
a
little
more
whiskey
flavor
would
have
made
this
a
little
more
tastier
overall
a
great
stout
and
the
cask
ageing
seems
to
have
a
legitimate
and
enjoyable
impact
on
flavour
overall
a
really
refreshing
flavorful
beer
not
much
like
a
stout
but
the
carbonation
makes
it
perfect
for
a
hot
day
o
this
beer
is
mellow
and
light
with
some
faint
notes
of
barrel
but
it
doesnt
have
much
character
drinkable
but
light
could
use
more
carbonation
body
feels
watery
for
this
type
of
beer
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
barrel
aged
english
stout
it
had
some
nice
irish
whiskey
aspects
and
some
nice
english
stout
aspects
neither
of
them
were
overpowering
which
made
for
some
nice
balance
in
this
beer
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
went
down
smoother
then
i
expected
i
could
see
drinking
one
or
two
of
these
the
flavors
does
a
good
job
of
holding
my
interest
i
wouldnt
turn
down
another
one
right
now
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
and
how
good
it
looked
in
my
snifter
those
aspects
were
for
sure
above
average
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
clear
bottle
and
that
it
had
a
little
too
much
sweetness
but
those
aspects
didnt
hurt
this
beer
that
much
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
was
priced
nicely
and
you
dont
normally
see
irish
whiskey
aged
beers
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
its
damn
good
im
starting
to
get
into
this
brewery
i
thought
their
rum
beer
was
solid
but
this
one
was
better
and
nicely
balanced
it
showcases
the
best
of
both
worlds
you
can
bet
i
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
their
original
and
other
beers
all
in
all
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
that
managed
to
impress
me
i
approve
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
to
try
i
really
enjoy
the
rum
cask
and
original
oak
aged
varieties
and
while
this
one
wasnt
bad
it
was
certainly
my
least
favorite
so
far
d
not
bad
this
is
the
best
of
the
innis
and
gunn
cask
aged
beer
that
ive
had
i
have
been
unimpressed
with
the
others
so
far
the
base
beer
is
a
nicely
brewed
english
stout
and
the
whiskey
notes
are
very
subtle
but
do
seem
to
add
something
to
the
experience
overall
incredibly
smooth
nice
flavor
and
very
drinkable
for
the
style
served
in
an
english
pint
glass
poured
a
very
dark
reddish
coffee
colour
with
a
thin
head
stained
a
toffee
colour
head
dissipates
quickly
except
for
where
it
lingers
around
the
edges
the
whiskey
is
most
prominent
on
the
nose
and
finish
giving
it
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
very
malty
flavour
that
develops
a
little
bit
as
it
warms
up
heavy
caramels
a
good
showing
d
yet
another
swing
and
a
miss
by
ig
all
of
their
beers
taste
the
same
with
the
exact
same
god
damn
cloying
butterscotch
sweetness
i
though
their
take
on
a
stout
might
be
a
bit
different
maybe
even
better
but
this
is
still
unmistakably
innis
gunn
and
to
me
thats
not
a
good
thing
black
body
with
a
dense
mocha
head
thin
retention
but
thick
lacing
nose
has
chocolate
roasted
coffee
a
heavy
dose
of
sweet
oak
irish
cream
liqueur
caramel
and
vanilla
taste
is
sweet
and
oaky
a
touch
of
whiskey
and
butterscotch
in
a
typical
innis
and
gunn
fashion
light
roastiness
and
a
baileys
liqueurlike
flavour
body
is
disappointingly
thin
and
watery
low
carbonation
some
good
ideas
here
but
everything
doesnt
seem
to
come
together
the
way
id
like
it
to
o
big
up
for
getting
really
mc
on
this
one
some
of
the
big
irish
stout
properties
combined
with
big
irish
whiskey
although
in
some
ways
it
seems
like
they
just
poured
the
two
into
the
bottle
well
worth
a
try
but
not
my
favourite
ig
offering
lcbo
seasonal
a
different
innis
gunn
on
the
creamy
side
a
decent
stout
at
that
with
bakers
chocolate
and
a
better
thana
verage
irish
whiskey
and
leaning
on
the
sweet
side
for
drinkability
roasty
aroma
an
mild
roasted
coffee
bordering
on
straight
out
roasted
barleycoffee
substitute
one
of
their
better
ones
very
dark
bodied
overall
i
am
not
impressed
dont
think
ill
be
purchasing
this
one
again
this
one
really
works
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
ig
it
seems
that
the
oak
aging
process
compliments
the
dark
roasted
flavors
quite
well
to
my
palate
the
whiskey
barrel
aging
doesnt
seem
to
add
too
much
to
the
stout
overall
however
it
certainly
does
add
an
extra
layer
to
whats
going
on
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
however
it
seems
more
like
an
experiment
than
something
that
was
intentional
when
it
comes
to
a
final
result
ive
never
seen
a
beer
so
opaque
before
the
head
is
also
very
dark
and
leaves
very
nice
lacing
the
smell
isnt
very
complex
but
its
still
good
molasses
bread
and
that
eversofaint
whiskey
quality
the
taste
however
is
a
step
above
because
the
whiskey
really
shines
through
it
almost
overpowers
the
other
flavours
of
molasses
and
malts
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
not
very
well
balanced
id
say
very
creamy
very
drinkable
it
it
wasnt
so
expensive
id
buy
this
again
overall
an
enjoyable
english
stout
by
innis
gunn
excellent
roasted
qualities
in
both
aroma
and
flavour
wished
there
was
a
bit
more
oak
and
whiskey
flavour
from
the
barrel
but
that
is
personal
preference
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
some
garnet
highlights
and
a
bit
of
creamy
tan
head
aroma
of
sweet
dark
malt
and
a
sweet
slightly
oaky
tinge
of
irish
whisky
palate
is
huge
on
malt
a
blend
of
biscuit
and
sweet
bread
theres
no
real
hop
character
to
speak
of
but
the
oak
and
whisky
from
the
barrel
shine
through
pretty
well
the
alcohol
is
wellintegrated
id
never
guess
that
this
is
7
4
abv
i
suppose
there
could
be
a
little
more
whisky
here
but
its
a
solid
beer
for
sure
deep
brown
colour
one
finger
of
tan
head
with
a
good
amount
of
lace
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
both
dark
and
milk
chocolate
vanilla
whiskey
notes
though
i
wouldnt
say
specifically
irish
whiskey
oak
barrel
scents
light
coffee
followed
by
more
milk
chocolate
taste
is
quite
roasted
up
front
bittersweet
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
oak
is
subtle
at
first
and
eventually
becomes
more
pronounced
towards
the
finish
some
whisky
flavours
but
not
as
overpowering
as
some
other
offers
from
this
brewer
vanilla
and
chocolate
finish
mouthfeel
is
quite
thin
and
a
touch
watery
lightmed
carb
light
feel
this
was
fairly
nice
and
would
have
been
far
better
if
it
had
a
little
more
body
one
of
the
few
ig
beers
i
havent
found
to
be
over
oaked
o
another
interesting
brew
from
innis
and
gunn
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
as
i
was
not
expecting
a
stout
did
not
read
the
bottle
t
while
this
was
decent
enough
considering
the
style
and
the
price
point
5
for
12
oz
it
was
extremely
disappointing
this
might
be
my
last
purchase
of
an
innis
gunn
beer
i
do
quite
like
this
even
though
my
prized
irish
whiskey
guest
star
gets
lost
in
the
mire
or
does
it
the
subtly
of
this
particular
spirit
may
just
help
round
out
an
already
decent
unassuming
stout
reduction
is
not
your
friend
with
this
one
im
sad
to
say
just
maybe
rein
in
the
sweetness
a
wee
bit
and
were
good
to
go
o
good
beer
but
the
whiskey
and
other
elements
dont
really
seem
to
come
together
very
well
if
you
were
hoping
for
an
irish
car
bomb
forget
it
and
although
this
sounds
like
a
marriage
made
in
heaven
its
not
in
fact
there
should
be
a
divorce
worth
a
try
for
sure
at
less
then
5
i
like
that
they
use
a
darker
beer
for
this
barrel
i
think
that
was
a
wise
move
one
of
the
better
ig
was
not
ruined
by
the
oak
overall
and
interesting
brew
not
good
for
every
day
but
a
nice
change
of
pace
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
the
feel
is
pretty
smooth
but
does
include
some
whiskey
character
there
is
that
little
kick
at
the
end
the
tingle
is
almost
gone
which
is
kind
of
nice
o
two
thumbs
up
it
is
an
all
around
enjoyable
experience
and
it
exceeded
my
expectations
my
only
regret
was
buying
4
of
them
i
will
definitely
be
going
back
to
pick
up
more
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
wellbalanced
stout
overall
this
is
better
than
its
rated
i
hope
they
do
it
again
id
buy
some
o
very
easy
to
drink
for
a
barrel
aged
offering
without
skimping
on
flavor
thumbs
up
overall

while
i
complained
about
the
carbonation
in
this
stout
it
is
still
an
excellent
stout
that
all
fans
of
the
style
should
seek
out
the
taste
is
excellent
and
i
would
heartily
recommend
this
beer
12oz
bottle
why
clear
i
was
very
worried
about
light
stricken
beer
glad
this
one
was
ok
poured
into
my
innis
gunn
tulip
glass
the
ale
is
near
black
with
some
ruby
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
when
held
to
a
light
huge
beige
head
leaves
some
great
lacing
on
the
glass
and
holds
good
retention
this
was
nice
to
look
at
aromas
are
irish
whiskey
up
front
with
some
roasted
malt
and
oak
tastes
are
roasted
and
smoked
malt
with
a
nice
dose
of
irish
whiskey
and
oak
with
some
vanilla
notes
followed
by
an
astringent
balsamic
vinegar
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
appropriate
carbonation
and
is
medium
bodied
overall
the
best
offering
from
innis
gunn
that
ive
had
to
this
point
nice
one
to
have
leading
up
to
st
patricks
day
i
might
have
to
get
another
for
the
actual
day
overall
a
stout
that
im
pleased
i
tried
the
taste
of
the
irish
whiskey
is
so
very
keen
concise
and
perfectly
placed
i
have
to
admit
i
tended
to
believe
this
was
some
sort
of
novelty
oak
aged
beer
hype
but
now
that
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
how
original
and
honest
this
stout
is
i
will
be
purchasing
a
4pack
or
more
for
next
week
st
pattys
day
bells
expedition
stout
still
sits
atop
this
holidays
choice
list
though
o
overall
this
is
a
good
scotch
ale
under
the
stout
name
i
could
definitely
enjoy
this
again
and
i
have
passed
this
up
many
times
when
i
have
seen
it
in
the
past
the
barrel
aging
is
present
but
not
prominent
and
while
they
do
add
character
this
is
more
of
an
english
cask
version
of
a
scotch
ale
than
an
americanized
version
o
i
dont
know
why
i
keep
buying
these
beers
acing
a
beer
in
a
whiskywhiskey
is
not
a
good
idea
the
oak
gives
it
an
artificial
detergent
like
backbone
i
wish
they
kept
the
time
in
the
barrels
were
kept
shorter
sonce
the
only
bad
thibg
about
this
beer
is
the
whiskey
o
quite
impressed
with
this
one
far
from
the
usual
innis
and
gunn
formula
good
job
pretty
good
not
as
rich
or
roasty
as
many
stouts
but
that
is
a
good
thing
here
some
fruit
and
malt
complexities
shine
through
with
oak
thanks
to
newbrewbb
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
served
in
a
tulip
nonic
pours
a
shade
darker
than
cola
with
a
halfinch
frothy
tancolored
head
that
settles
into
a
bubbly
band
and
a
thin
film
some
thin
spots
and
swaths
of
lacing
are
exposed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
lactose
andor
artificial
sweetener
malt
and
ethanol
with
just
the
slightest
suggestion
of
a
whiskey
character
taste
is
more
consistent
with
a
dark
mildporter
hybrid
with
a
suggestion
of
booze
in
the
background
than
an
english
stout
a
residual
wheatygrainy
quality
lingers
at
the
finish
im
also
not
sure
where
the
barrel
comes
into
play
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
light
even
carbonation
the
leaves
a
residual
tickle
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
alcohol
is
wellhidden
but
the
overall
character
is
a
bit
lackluster
overall
could
have
been
more
as
a
new
addition
to
the
brewery
i
think
we
are
spoiled
in
america
with
all
of
our
oak
aged
imperial
stouts
so
this
seems
weak
drinkable
but
a
little
expensive
and
i
would
prefer
other
beers
from
innis
gunn
mo
medium
to
heavy
body
with
good
carbonation
despite
the
bubble
size
easy
to
drink
and
the
style
and
aging
compliment
each
other
well
it
does
have
2
of
the
3
ingredients
in
a
irish
car
bomb
haha
perfect
night
cap
beer
imo
or
just
an
every
day
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
different
overall
interesting
pretty
tasty
a
bit
hot
and
boozy
for
only
7
4
nice
barrel
and
various
whisky
flavors
decent
malts
but
not
anywhere
near
what
i
would
call
stout
even
the
appearance
tells
you
that
edit
lol
gave
the
same
ratings
exactly
as
the
person
below
me
m
a
bit
watery
in
taste
dry
and
chalky
this
was
a
smooth
easytodrink
beer
very
enjoyable
12
oz
bottle
this
one
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
frothy
tan
head
on
it
that
leaves
some
lacing
malts
and
oak
are
the
predominate
aromas
slight
whiff
of
whiskey
also
maybe
some
roastiness
also
the
taste
is
good
caramel
and
toffee
malts
slight
roast
a
very
subdued
peaty
whiskey
flavor
just
a
bit
sweet
lots
of
hops
in
here
to
balance
this
one
very
nice
i
would
say
this
is
more
tolerable
than
the
last
example
i
had
from
this
brewery
they
have
an
interesting
niche
but
they
really
should
switch
to
darker
bottles
in
order
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
their
beers
one
of
my
favorite
whiskey
cask
aged
beers
its
between
a
sipper
and
an
easy
drinker
which
for
a
cask
aged
beer
is
impressive
not
hardly
sweet
at
all
which
is
great
overall
this
is
a
fairly
complex
and
moderately
sweet
stout
with
a
solid
marriage
of
complimentary
smells
and
flavors
a
very
good
solid
stout
highly
recommend
o
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
excited
at
the
irish
whiskey
barrel
aging
but
im
guessing
it
was
very
brief
since
i
dont
really
detect
any
whiskey
notes
theres
just
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
oak
but
thats
it
flavor
is
good
up
front
but
theres
a
bit
of
an
odd
ash
in
the
aftertaste
that
detracts
and
prevents
it
from
getting
higher
scores
not
the
most
enjoyable
of
this
brewery
above
average
unique
and
interesting
missing
body
out
of
style
an
interesting
beer
i
dont
know
that
im
inclined
to
buy
it
again
but
its
worth
trying
overall
its
decent
and
its
drinkable
but
thats
all
i
have
to
say
about
it
decent
irish
whiskey
aroma
color
is
black
with
a
very
nice
tan
head
the
taste
has
light
roasted
malts
chocolate
light
oak
very
light
vanilla
bean
and
very
subtle
whiskey
flavor
has
hints
of
vanilla
with
a
faint
sweetness
taste
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
o
by
far
one
the
better
whiskey
stouts
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
definitely
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
many
times
over
i
cant
wait
for
my
next
round
overall
i
like
this
and
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
if
i
saw
it
its
nothing
earth
shattering
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
very
dangerous
at
7
sweet
and
buttery
a
slight
roast
in
the
aftertaste
but
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
was
a
stout
straightaway
some
astringency
possibly
from
the
barrel
slightly
drying
aftertaste
mild
roastiness
hard
to
pinpoint
the
oak
here
though
there
is
some
diacetyl
and
traces
of
the
base
stout
but
its
a
bit
muddled
and
sweet
like
the
rest
of
their
output
ive
tried
not
bad
but
not
unique
enough
to
seek
out
over
local
stuff
the
carbonation
is
light
with
lots
of
small
smooth
bubbles
the
liquid
is
smooth
well
its
a
decent
beer
i
dont
quite
see
this
being
a
goto
though
mostly
none
existent
nose
touch
of
irish
sweetness
but
looks
great
black
creamy
head
taste
is
smooth
no
barrel
though
irish
whiskey
sweetness
malolactic
vanilla
extract
touch
of
roast
every
thing
is
very
light
and
smooth
given
irish
whiskey
is
light
and
smooth
but
i
hoped
for
a
bit
more
if
it
was
a
six
pack
for
the
same
price
i
could
drink
it
easily
but
a
four
pack
is
a
touch
too
much
for
the
easy
drinker
this
is
overall
a
very
easy
drinker
smooth
and
quaffable
o
ive
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
first
sampling
of
innis
gunns
offerings
and
am
excited
to
try
the
next
the
irish
whiskey
cask
stout
is
a
spectacularly
crafted
contribution
to
the
family
of
whiskey
barrelaged
stouts
being
uniquely
modest
in
price
and
form
o
rwally
nice
and
extremely
unique
now
if
i
only
they
would
put
this
in
brown
bottles
overall
well
crafted
and
incredibly
well
put
together
this
isnt
the
best
thing
to
happen
to
beer
but
best
thing
to
happen
to
some
stouts
finally
something
out
there
to
make
you
think
twice
when
ordering
a
dark
beer
salud
noticeable
irish
whiskey
aroma
black
with
a
light
half
inch
tan
head
has
that
whiskey
warming
mouth
feel
to
it
finishes
clean
mild
vanilla
taste
with
a
faint
fruit
taste
also
im
really
liking
this
one
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
wish
i
had
got
more
than
one
bottle
a
stout
from
ig
aged
for
two
months
in
irish
whiskey
casks
yes
please
it
pours
a
dark
rubyblackbrown
topped
by
a
relatively
small
wisp
of
light
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
blunt
roasted
malts
light
char
very
light
whiskey
light
darkroasted
coffee
and
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
powder
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
roasted
malts
cocoa
powder
light
oak
very
light
vanilla
bean
very
light
whiskey
melds
deeply
with
the
oak
and
a
hint
of
coffee
everything
comes
through
lightly
layered
and
with
igs
signature
subtlety
of
flavor
combination
that
said
it
seems
like
it
should
have
a
more
powerful
taste
somehow
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
a
very
nice
beer
one
that
comes
across
as
somehow
both
complex
and
simple
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
a
great
english
stout
from
middle
ages
i
wouldve
expected
them
to
knock
this
style
out
of
the
park
i
have
to
admit
perhaps
the
best
ales
middle
ages
brews
are
stouts
highly
recommended
and
a
must
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
a
good
robust
stout
o
nice
beer
and
easy
to
get
down
very
creamy
and
smooth
and
lots
of
taste
for
the
abv
good
stuff
and
great
for
the
style
d
its
a
really
easy
drinking
stout
of
which
you
could
put
back
a
few
pints
pretty
much
on
point
for
style
with
a
wonderful
texture
that
makes
it
go
down
even
easier
would
love
to
try
on
cask
or
nitro
overall
a
tasty
brew
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
have
this
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
sweet
up
front
with
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
back
with
no
aftertaste
the
whole
thing
start
to
finish
is
pretty
sweet
but
it
is
an
english
stout
i
like
it
i
would
have
it
again
for
sure
if
i
saw
it
on
draft
pours
near
black
with
a
moderatelythick
tan
head
good
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
a
good
amount
of
dark
chocolate
along
with
some
roasted
malt
and
coffee
good
combination
slight
smokiness
to
it
as
well
the
flavor
really
combines
all
of
these
elements
quite
well
as
with
all
of
the
beers
i
had
from
them
there
was
a
touch
of
diacetyl
but
it
fit
in
well
with
the
style
way
to
use
that
english
yeast
the
smoke
really
makes
this
beer
medium
body
with
a
slightlysmokey
and
dry
finish
still
some
body
to
pick
it
back
up
really
solid
this
beer
is
solid
and
unadorned
but
everything
about
it
is
quite
good
d
not
that
impressive
ok
but
the
dragonslayer
puts
it
to
shame
pours
reddish
brown
very
dark
but
not
opaque
lots
of
white
head
thinner
then
i
was
expecting
smells
roasty
and
wdonerful
tastes
very
roasted
with
lots
of
crisp
hints
of
barley
coming
through
the
roast
a
little
thin
on
the
pallette
but
that
is
consistent
with
the
style
well
carbonated
and
definitely
tasty
beer
d
i
drank
it
for
hours
i
can
see
this
being
a
beer
to
keep
refilling
my
glass
with
throughout
a
night
of
cards
blackheart
is
a
good
stout
and
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
for
a
good
malt
fix
when
i
got
it
if
dark
charred
malts
are
not
your
thing
steer
clear
of
this
one
d
very
good
put
down
the
entire
growler
myself
in
an
afternoon
poured
from
a
growler
shared
by
number1bum
at
a
recent
gatheringtasting
appears
a
deep
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
creamy
tan
head
minimal
lacing
coats
the
glass
notes
of
rich
roasted
grains
bitter
cocoa
and
a
hint
of
coffee
make
up
the
nose
tastes
of
toasted
roasted
and
caramelized
grains
touch
of
milk
chocolate
mocha
bitter
cocoa
and
the
slightest
hint
of
smoke
tasty
stuff
id
love
a
growler
of
this
all
to
myself
a
notch
below
full
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
this
growler
has
traveled
well
if
you
can
find
this
one
on
tap
dont
pass
it
up
d
very
good
pint
disappeared
pretty
quickly
drinkability
is
good
if
i
had
had
the
money
to
get
a
growler
of
it
then
i
would
have
d
my
buddy
and
i
had
no
trouble
getting
through
this
growler
in
fact
we
both
wanted
more
big
thanks
to
beertruth
for
the
chance
to
try
this
via
trade
thanks
adam
i
wonder
if
middle
ages
will
ever
bottle
this
overall
a
very
tasty
and
robust
stout
a
new
favorite
of
mine
many
thanks
to
beertruth
for
this
gem
d
with
the
low
abv
and
wonderful
taste
i
could
have
gone
for
another
one
very
drinkable
everyday
stout
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
i
dont
know
why
they
dont
bottle
it
definitely
pick
some
up
if
you
ever
visit
the
brewery
or
a
bar
that
has
it
on
tap
feels
thick
as
hell
but
also
smooth
and
oily
leaves
a
thick
coating
somehow
thickens
as
it
warms
its
very
balanced
even
though
its
really
thick
and
strong
sweet
enough
for
one
repeat
feelstastes
like
it
has
a
lot
of
alcohol
d
a
delicious
morning
snack
d
while
i
currently
prefer
my
stouts
to
be
on
the
sweeter
side
this
one
is
really
awsome
with
a
mouth
feel
that
is
great
and
a
flavor
profile
that
stands
strong
and
independent
very
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
have
gone
with
all
night
if
there
werent
a
few
hundred
more
to
choose
from
drinkability
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
dreally
good
this
could
be
a
session
would
rank
higher
if
the
abv
was
lower
area
was
it
worth
it
yes
the
servers
were
very
generous
with
samples
this
was
my
third
choice
and
it
was
best
by
far
black
almost
oily
light
tan
head
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
and
burnt
coffee
hints
of
same
in
flavor
very
smooth
tasting
i
got
a
growler
at
the
brewery
but
couldnt
find
it
in
bottles
at
the
couple
of
stores
i
stopped
in
buffalo
i
would
recommend
this
beer
highly
its
very
similar
to
anchor
porter
in
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
an
excellant
session
beer
for
a
chilly
night
filling
tasty
but
not
too
much
of
an
alcohol
load
i
got
this
on
cask
at
mahars
in
albany
ny
it
poured
jet
black
with
a
thick
long
lasting
dark
mocha
head
it
has
strong
chocolate
and
roasted
aromas
the
flavors
are
the
same
with
a
strong
roasted
flavor
and
chocolate
background
the
body
is
medium
to
full
and
it
has
good
drinkability
had
an
imperial
pint
of
this
on
cask
at
mahars
in
albany
pint
was
pulled
with
expertise
as
they
are
definately
gurus
at
this
bar
this
beer
sat
jet
black
in
the
glass
with
a
generous
fluffy
dense
light
brown
head
aromas
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
sweet
malt
rose
from
the
pint
flavors
were
very
reminiscent
of
the
smells
roasty
and
bitter
up
front
and
soon
rounded
out
with
chocolate
and
sweet
malt
this
was
a
substantial
beer
with
a
nice
medium
to
mediumfull
body
higher
than
average
alcohol
but
many
flavors
mingled
together
to
form
an
amazing
concoction
a
nice
drinking
beer
for
the
cold
weather
season
and
excellent
on
cask
poured
a
jet
black
with
a
huge
cream
colored
head
that
took
a
long
while
to
settle
down
lace
made
the
glass
opaque
this
was
definatly
fresh
smell
was
of
rosted
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
was
great
roasted
coffee
and
malts
very
nice
slight
hop
is
the
back
and
the
taste
lingered
deep
dark
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
caramel
very
nicely
done
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
perfect
for
a
stout
thick
nicely
carbonated
smooth
delivery
and
just
great
i
could
really
drink
this
all
the
time
too
bad
its
2000
miles
away
great
great
brew
ive
been
disappointed
in
the
past
with
stouts
on
cask
but
this
is
a
winner
pitch
black
with
a
short
tan
head
aroma
left
a
little
be
desired
on
cask
generally
on
tap
there
are
a
great
rich
dark
roasted
coffee
smell
ill
have
to
review
again
next
time
i
have
a
growler
anyways
taste
was
dry
and
a
bit
bitter
with
heavy
black
grains
and
a
hint
of
mocha
while
ive
had
trouble
finishing
a
growler
of
this
before
my
imperial
pint
of
the
cask
disappeared
on
no
time
give
it
a
try
on
tap
at
the
pizza
plant
on
mainpoured
from
the
tap
an
opaque
black
no
light
showing
thru
at
all
with
a
creamy
mocha
colored
one
finger
head
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
mixed
with
dark
roast
coffee
and
a
lingering
earthinessa
great
combination
of
flavors
going
on
starts
out
with
some
bitter
chocolate
notes
intertwined
with
a
big
dark
roast
coffee
presence
melding
into
a
really
dry
earthy
finish
a
very
nice
stout
has
alot
of
flavors
from
beginning
to
endhighly
recommended
maybe
it
was
an
oxidizedold
cask
maybe
its
just
not
meant
to
be
im
not
sure
id
like
to
rereview
this
on
draft
or
in
a
bottle
this
one
marks
another
winner
from
middle
ages
well
conceived
and
balanced
easy
to
drink
and
highly
enjoyable

somewhat

there
is
a

of
a

black

flavor
as
well
much
like
if
anchor
porter
was
more
english
in
flavor
and
really
went
wholehog
into
stout
territory
velvety
mouthfeel
mediumtofullbodied
dry
and
just
a
tad
sharp
at
the
finish
this
is
what
a
session
stout
looks
smells
tastes
and
drinks
like
i
dont
think
this
one
is
bottled
but
it
ought
to
be
just
so
more
folks
can
recognize
how
great
it
really
is
splendid
offering
from
ma
definitely
one
of
their
best
very
pretty
pour
midnight
black
with
a
thick
chocolate
brown
head
i
was
saddened
to
watch
the
bartender
spoon
it
off
but
cheered
when
he
filled
the
recently
emptied
space
with
more
beer
nose
was
mildly
of
coffee
and
some
sort
of
wine
aroma
that
i
have
had
before
i
want
to
say
it
was
a
deep
burgundy
red
wine
but
my
wine
knowledge
is
slim
so
i
dare
not
hazard
a
guess
flavor
was
very
bold
and
jumped
out
on
the
tongue
some
coffe
and
dark
chocolates
the
burnt
malts
really
came
out
well
and
were
heavy
on
the
tongue
the
malts
provided
a
bit
of
a
biter
bite
which
was
compounded
nicely
by
the
hops
the
hops
came
out
more
from
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
made
me
think
of
christmas
eve
medium
body
with
a
slight
dry
finish
very
drinkable
especially
with
my
bbq
a
previous
middle
ages
dark
offering
had
been
found
a
bit
wanting
so
i
was
a
touch
leery
but
there
was
no
need
to
be
the
aroma
gave
fleeting
evidence
of
what
was
to
come
and
it
didnt
disappoint
it
has
a
dark
earthy
stout
flavor
without
laying
waste
to
the
palate
with
tooacrid
bitterness
or
titanic
abv
just
as
the
style
should
the
rather
sparse
mouthpresence
was
the
sole
misdeed
keeping
the
beers
assets
from
being
appreciated
longer
that
said
what
i
did
experience
was
enjoyable
and
id
have
no
reservations
about
coming
back
this
way
again
because
it
is
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
had
on
cask
two
years
later
and
didnt
work
that
day
cask
conditioned
stout
aged
with
jack
daniels
oak
barrels
dark
opaque
black
colored
beer
fine
bubbled
dark
khaki
colored
head
that
left
a
sheet
of
lace
as
the
beer
dissapeared
aroma
of
chocolate
malt
dark
roasted
malt
and
a
barely
noticeable
whiskey
undertone
the
mouthfeel
was
awesome
so
soft
and
smooth
just
coated
your
tongue
with
flavor
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
in
the
flavor
along
with
a
bit
of
the
oak
aged
vanilla
undertone
and
just
a
pinch
of
dry
bitterness
i
think
this
beer
would
have
been
awesome
from
a
cask
without
the
barrel
aging
but
it
does
add
a
bit
to
the
beers
complexity
this
beer
was
just
incredible
i
should
have
given
it
a
10
for
drinkability
so
much
going
on
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
none
of
which
jumped
out
but
all
where
solidly
intermixing
this
beer
was
just
incredible
i
should
have
given
it
a
10
for
drinkability
the
taste
was
something
else
all
together
rich
dark
chocolate
seems
to
melt
at
the
touch
of
my
tongue
so
elegant
i
almost
feel
like
im
below
this
fantastic
beer
but
what
the
truck
i
love
it
so
im
going
to
keep
drinking
it
really
smooth
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
sweet
malts
up
front
with
coffeechocolate
leading
to
a
bitter
finish
excellent
stout
bender
factor
finished
this
growler
last
out
of
4
others
save
the
best
for
last
right
i
figured
that
it
would
be
a
perfect
way
for
me
to
end
the
evening
after
drinking
a
pale
an
ipa
and
an
imperial
ipa
bhs
was
refreshing
the
beer
pours
a
deep
black
color
with
thick
dark
brown
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
rich
black
malt
scent
with
roasted
barley
helping
round
out
the
aroma
it
has
that
trademark
ringwood
yeast
fruitiness
but
it
barely
shows
up
the
taste
is
good
this
is
a
real
dark
brew
with
lots
of
emphasis
on
the
black
malts
it
goes
down
smooth
but
finishes
dry
and
with
a
roasted
barley
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
stout
but
it
may
be
a
bit
too
dark
for
some
this
stout
smelled
like
a
porter
that
is
a
compliment
in
many
ways
it
tasted
more
like
a
porter
too
very
flavorful
the
end
taste
is
dry
as
is
the
beginning
but
in
the
middle
you
get
sweetness
finishes
great
nice
and
dry
f
an
extremely
flavorful
and
complex
stout
one
of
mas
better
efforts
and
thats
saying
a
lot
not
all
that
interesting
but
it
tastes
pretty
nice
to
me
id
try
it
again
final
thoughts
a
good
american
stout
but
nothing
special
its
robustness
is
almost
a
bad
thing
because
i
was
anticipating
something
more
drinkable
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
not
this
tastes
like
someone
tossed
some
hershey
bars
and
a
can
of
coffee
into
the
bonfire
and
then
made
smoke
juice
this
really
tastes
like
bottled
smoke
on
a
side
note
they
could
put
a
little
more
effort
into
their
packaging
the
labeling
kind
of
sucks
the
only
reason
i
bought
the
six
pack
is
because
it
had
six
different
beers
in
it
and
i
couldnt
make
up
my
mid
at
the
store
as
to
what
i
wanted
perhaps
their
best
beer
obtained
bottle
at
champanes
cellars
dry
chocolate
coffee
roast
stout
black
with
enormous
amount
of
mocha
coloured
head
cocoa
aroma
as
well
as
roast
and
chocolate
smooth
mouthfeel
similar
to
oveltine
if
overltine
was
a
beer
good
drinkabilitythough
dry
with
sips
revealing
more
sugar
sweet
and
roast
bitter
poured
like
oil
from
the
bottle
to
the
glass
however
remarkably
not
a
cloying
stout
nice
and
roasty
smokey
flavor
with
a
clean
dry
finish
not
super
complex
flavors
but
that
makes
it
clean
and
drinkable
light
cocoa
dried
fruit
with
a
tinge
of
floral
hops
make
this
a
very
drinkable
and
appreciated
stout
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
a
6
pack
tastebig
roasty
flavorsubtle
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
semidry
finish
with
faint
herbal
hop
note
decent
flavor
and
drinkability
a
nice
match
for
a
pulled
pork
sandwich
as
a
beer
in
general
i
didnt
mind
drinking
this
but
for
a
stout
its
poor
moutfeel
and
overall
is
meh
nothing
special
nothing
awful
i
hope
this
brewery
does
well
and
makes
great
beer
this
just
is
not
one
of
them
i
see
that
a
lot
of
reviewers
liked
this
beer
and
will
admit
that
while
this
beer
was
made
good
for
what
it
is
i
just
find
it
to
not
be
a
good
tasting
stout
but
luckily
there
are
stouts
out
there
that
i
like
d
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
its
just
a
little
too
watery
and
onedimensional
for
a
stout
it
is
an
okay
beer
but
not
one
that
really
showed
me
a
lot
drinkability
everything
started
out
so
well
but
fell
apart
at
the
first
sip
ridiculously
thin
and
watery
oh
well
one
and
done
for
this
beer
overall
quite
enjoyable
its
not
a
huge
aggressive
beer
as
advertised
but
its
tasty
and
rich
and
doesnt
appear
infected
like
the
other
beers
in
this
6er
i
would
purchase
this
one
again
it
reminds
me
of
bert
grants
imperial
stout
if
anyone
remembers
it
another
misleadingly
labeled
beer
d
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
that
is
smooth
and
not
overly
rich
i
would
get
this
again
speaking
of
which
i
wish
this
small
grand
rapids
brewery
all
the
success
in
the
world
but
theyll
have
to
earn
it
bonecrusher
stout
is
not
getting
them
off
to
a
rousing
start
maybe
hopknocker
imperial
ipa
will
be
better
it
could
hardly
be
worse
good
english
or
foreign
type
stout
just
dont
expect
and
american
stout
and
youll
enjoy
this
fine
dark
brown
in
colorwith
a
thin
tan
head
aroma
of
dark
roasted
maltchocolateand
sour
bitter
coffee
flavor
was

bitter

drinkable
but
not

pretty

i
had
a

of

and
it
was
about
perfect
for
this
cheers
sample
at
the
super
terrific
stout
tasting
on
021608
two
stouts
whose
labels
feature
an
axe
being
wielded
cool
this
beer
is
blackishbrown
with
a
medium
and
foamy
light
brown
head
that
diminishes
slowly
rings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consists
mainly
of
coffee
along
with
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
dark
chocolate
medium
smooth
body
with
a
tasty
chocolate
and
coffee
character
along
with
light
hops
and
malt
the
finish
is
mild
and
roasty
with
a
mocha
aftertaste
better
than
expected
i
would
try
this
again
above
average
twist
on
an
americanized
english
stout
schmohz
does
a
good
job
keeping
this
one
consistant
between
batches
this
is
one
of
their
mainstays
so
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
falling
for
it
and
then
having
it
go
away
the
icing
on
the
cake
would
be
to
offer
it
on
nitro
with
a
creamer
faucet
very
drinkale
not
worth
6
freakin
dollars
screw
you
cool
looking

very
dark

roasted

some
acidity
like

taste
roasted

and
toffee
unripe

mouthfeel
sour
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
drinkability
very
bad
i
guess
its
made
with
hops
too
green
or
not
mature
enough
fruity
and
quite
sour
on
the
palate
really
venturing
into
flemish
territory
its
that
sour
could
this
have
been
the
brewers
intent
if
so
then
he
has
odd
tastes
and
an
odd
comprehension
of
the
style
sour
orange
unripe
strawberry
a
hint
of
prunes
quick
sharp
finish
and
fairly
fizzy
carbonation
i
am
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
as
a
stout
it
can
only
be
called
a
failure
but
it
succeeds
in
a
way
as
a
sour
ale
not
impressed
with
this
beer
overall
maybe
it
was
the
fact
that
it
was
brought
back
all
the
way
from
mexico
in
a
cargo
hold
before
i
got
to
drink
it
but
it
just
doesnt
seem
very
well
thought
out
at
least
its
in
a
cool
blue
bottle
i
wont
have
more
than
1
if
i
were
you
but
is
nice
for
a
mexican
stout
im
glad
that
we
are
exploring
the
ales
world
and
not
just
sticking
to
the
old
corona
and
sol
adjunct
lager
type
of
beer
tasted
161008
drinkability
great
looking
bottle
but
inside
is
a
beer
that
is
not
so
great
if
they
hadnt
watered
down
the
malts
so
much
this
wouldnt
have
been
such
a
bad
beer
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
if
youre
a
bottle
collector
you
should
consider
buying
just
the
bottle
but
if
youre
just
a
beer
drinker
just
be
careful
cerveza
potro
potro
means
horse
is
a
lousy
product
in
an
impressive
package
dont
be
a
sucker
like
i
was
and
spend
5
99
on
this
swill
far
from
being
a
thoroughbred
this
nag
is
ready
for
the
glue
factory
bleh
not
recommended
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
head
that
really
doesnt
stick
around
long
at
all
if
it
did
id
be
more
inclined
to
give
a
higher
score
nose
is
a
mix
between
smoky
roasted
qualities
and
dirty
water
seems
to
have
a
bit
of
cheap
licorice
candy
fragrance
as
well
not
impressed
flavor
is
just
way
off
so
thin
and
watered
down
and
just
dirty
in
general
lacks
elegance
body
or
grace
i
am
not
even
going
to
bother
with
elaborating
feel
is
thin
with
low
carbonation
and
still
that
dirty
water
edge
no
way
is
this
drinkable
this
is
going
down
the
drain
avoid
like
the
plague
i
bought
it
because
it
was
a
cool
bottle
if
i
had
read
reviews
beforehand
i
would
have
avoided
avoid
avoid
avoid
overall
a
very
strange
brew
and
not
really
in
a
good
way
possibly
the
weirdest
stout
ive
ever
had
maybe
worth
a
try
once
interesting
at
the
outset
you
have
to
give
credit
to
this
brewer
for
venturing
to
make
a
stout
in
mexico
this
bottle
cant
be
beat
i
love
the
long
neck
the
smell
is
new
to
me
maybe
i
should
have
expected
it
but
this
mexican
beer
has
a
hint
of
lime
to
it
also
a
sour
yeast
nose
i
dont
have
an
idea
where
it
comes
from
the
taste
has
the
same
sour
notes
but
the
addition
of
a
roasty
finish
pretty
thin
both
in
taste
and
consistency
but
this
makes
it
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
great
beer
if
it
was
on
tap
at
a
local
bar
but
it
is
definitely
not
something
i
would
seek
out
500
ml
blue
liqueur
design
bottle
bought
in
edinburgh
lote
00148
abv
is
4
7
black
coloured
beer
reddish
brown
in
the
highlights
large
to
moderate
tan
head
unusual
aroma
with
notes
of
balsamic
vinegar
dark
fermenting
fruits
ensilage
burned
rubber
and
glue
hints
of
chocolate
and
liquorice
good
and
notsogood
at
the
same
time
the
flavour
is
moderately
roasty
fruity
and
acidic
with
distinct
notes
of
smoke
hints
of
liquorice
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
very
far
from
being
the
best
porter
in
the
world
but
worth
a
try
drinkability
who
knows
maybe
lot
133
is
right
on
the
money
though
i
will
say
that
that
blue
bottle
is
the
bees
knees
this
beer
is
not
anything
it
should
be
it
smells
almost
ok
then
the
flavor
is
so
off
it
hurts
i
had
to
sneeze
it
is
a
nice
beer
one
of
mexicos
finest
english
stout
i
prefer
it
over
guinness
it
was
drinkable
but
not
worth
trying
again
at
the
price
i
paid
this
is
kind
of
like
a
watered
down
stout
for
people
on
low
carb
diets
but
that
doesnt
really
make
sense
so
essentially
its
pointless
it
would
be
worth
a
try
if
it
werent
as
expensive
as
it
is
definitely
not
as
the
bottle
claims
mexicos
finest
nice
looking
cobalt
bottle
with
a
tag
around
the
neck
sour
off
aroma
as
it
pours
a
black
with
decent
clarity
and
very
little
head
taste
is
extremely
one
dimensional
with
a
bit
of
off
malt
flavor
and
some
of
the
sourness
promised
by
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
thin
drinkability
is
pour
this
beer
is
all
hat
no
cattle
and
this
is
certainly
not
an
english
stout
someones
mixed
up
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
with
lots
of
active
carbonation
ends
up
a
bit
too
watery
i
dont
recall
what
i
paid
for
this
bottle
but
i
dont
see
it
as
something
id
be
coming
back
to
again
soon
worth
a
try
but
it
doesnt
end
up
doing
it
for
me
drinkability
despite
its
numerous
flaws
this
beer
is
a
decent
quaffer
very
easy
to
drink
with
some
interesting
flavors
the
marketing
promo
that
is
attached
to
the
bottle
describes
this
as
an
old
world
style
mexican
cerveza
and
a
dark
ale
perhaps
we
are
not
evaluating
this
in
the
proper
category
as
it
is
a
poor
stout
or
porter
but
would
be
a
decent
dark
lager
potro
is
almost
black
in
color
with
a
short
light
brown
head
the
smell
strength
is
weak
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
coffee
is
noted
as
well
as
a
hint
of
chocolate
taste
is
that
of
a
slightly
watery
stout
roasted
malt
flavors
are
there
but
seem
thined
out
coffee
flavor
is
most
prevalent
and
is
joined
by
a
touch
of
chocolate
there
isnt
enough
flavor
here
to
get
excited
the
brewer
needs
to
beef
up
the
malt
for
this
to
improve
16
9
ounce
blue
bottle
fill
level
at
nearly
4
below
crown
this
is
in
my
opinion
is
one
of
those
comfort
beers
while
it
not
amazingly
complex
and
unique
it
was
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
had
a
good
consistent
flavor
that
was
unique
for
its
stlye
it
pours
a
really
nice
mocha
brown
head
and
with
a
scents
of
butterscotch
roasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
hoppy
bitterness
it
tasted
great
nice
and
smooth
hints
of
roasted
malts
a
slight
hoppy
bitterness
and
a
maybe
a
slight
slight
hint
of
mocha
overal
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
yes
the
bottle
was
very
cool
looking
beer
comes
in
the
coolest
bottle
out
there
in
beerland
pours
pitch
black
no
can
see
thru
the
light
head
disappears
quickly
smells
a
bit
like
cocoa
taste
is
a
really
nice
cocoa
flavor
and
some
burnt
malt
but
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
of
a
let
down
real
thin
and
watery
overall
it
is
pretty
good
one
of
two
beers
from
mexico
that
is
pretty
tasty
negra
modelo
is
the
other
tastes
more
like
a
black
lager
rather
than
a
porter
but
its
still
pretty
good
worth
seeking
out
saw
the
cool
looking
bottle
at
the
store
and
grabbed
one
apparently
its
a
mexican
brewed
porter
although
the
bottle
makes
no
mention
of
the
beer
style
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
brown
head
that
disappears
after
a
minute
or
two
smell
has
hints
of
malt
and
some
chemical
i
cant
id
the
taste
is
ok
average
nothing
special
has
hints
of
chocolate
malt
all
in
all
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
average
ive
had
worse
and
a
lot
that
are
better
mouthfeel
a
little
dry
and
creamy
but
mostly
bland
this
would
be
a
good
dark
beer
to
throw
back
one
after
another
the
drinkablity
is
what
is
nice
about
this
beer
ultimately
this
is
a
session
beer
disguised
as
a
craft
beer
id
get
it
again
if
i
could
get
a
12
pack
for
7
but
theres
no
way
im
spending
5
for
a
bottle
of
this
weak
beer
my
search
for
a
great
mexican
beer
continues
bought
this
for
the
equivalent
of
2
30
in
a
mexican
gas
station
near
the
town
of
queretaro
by
mexico
city
great
500
ml
cobalt
blue
bottle
beer
color
is
dark
coffee
brown
body
on
the
heavy
side
steady
carbonation
but
a
weird
smell
do
they
use
cactus
or
tequila
in
this
brew
toasted
grain
aroma
definite
licorice
notes
medium
sweetness
nuts
milkiness
malty
roasted
nutty
aroma
metallic
and
an
odd
flavor
this
porter
has
something
unusual
in
it
i
just
can
not
place
it
above
average
as
far
as
mexican
beers
go
and
not
too
bad
but
you
need
to
acquire
a
taste
for
this
one
maybe
this
is
a
dark
lager
in
disguise
i
think
the
best
mexican
beer
pours
a
onefinger
light
tan
head
that
goes
quickly
leaving
traces
of
lace
totally
black
color
light
carbonation
and
light
bodied
nose
is
slightly
malty
starts
sweet
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
finish
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
i
have
had
5
49
for
500ml
bottle
from
tullys
beer
wine
wells
me
very
dark
body
with
a
tiny
head
that
leaves
a
good
lace
when
i
saw
this
bottle
i
wasnt
expecting
a
porter
good
smell
a
little
coffe
like
roasted
malt
all
over
good
decent
taste
it
leaves
the
feeling
of
eating
something
burnt
but
i
think
thats
the
point
of
a
porter
extremely
i
am
fascinated
and
contented
for
this
beer
a
real
mexican
porter
in
mexico
made
by
mexican
in
the
birthplace
of
our
independence
viva
mexico
its
flavor
nothing
requests
to
english
porter
its
aroma
nothing
request
to
the
irish
his
bottle
had
a
touch
of
vintage
look
in
blue
cobalt
only
one
thing
his
label
it
leaves
much
to
be
desired
his
caramel
and
chocolat
malt
gives
a
wonderful
flavor
nice
product
as
other
said
it
is
a
surprise
and
coming
from
a
tequila
producer
it
has
toasted
grains
on
int
smells
like
coffee
like
a
stout
may
say
the
bottle
is
really
awesome
for
a
mexican
beer
i
think
more
products
like
this
should
be
made
new
in
mexican
market
and
new
from
the
country
to
the
world
the
carbonation
is
average
and
soft
flavor
is
just
as
nose
advertises
fairly
mild
up
front
with
some
brown
sugar
and
caramel
almost
too
light
in
flavor
after
the
swallow
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
lingers
in
my
mouth
the
finish
is
the
strongest
part
of
the
flavor
profile
for
sure
the
beer
is
not
deep
or
complex
but
there
is
some
flavor
and
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
sunny
beach
day
but
for
drinking
in
my
apartment
it
is
average
a
surprisingly
decent
beer
from
mexico
world
class
cobalt
blue
bottle
pours
almost
black
dark
tan
head
and
wispy
lacing
nose
is
of
powdered
sugar
chocolate
and
coffee
fairly
thin
body
wise
watery
in
the
mid
section
nice
subtle
notes
of
more
chocolate
and
coffee
picked
up
cant
pick
up
much
if
any
hopsbittering
late
eh
i
didnt
have
real
high
hopes
for
a
porter
from
mexico
this
one
tastes
more
like
a
light
sweet
caribean
stout
there
is
much
better
porterstout
out
there
drinkability
well
all
i
can
say
its
cinco
de
mayo
and
if
i
have
to
have
a
mexican
beer
then
it
will
be
this
one
corona
i
can
water
my
plants
with
olé
salud
drinkability
the
first
bock
i
have
had
from
mexico
not
bad
considering
just
about
every
beer
i
have
had
from
there
has
been
a
disappointment
except
for
maybe
negro
modello
overll
this
is
a
good
stout
with
decent
flavour
and
a
great
look
and
smell
drink
this
beside
a
guinness
man
and
feel
like
a
man
next
to
the
goon
beside
you
no
offence
intended
to
the
guinness
boys
but
this
one
has
real
flavour
the
mf
lets
it
down
slightly
and
the
burnt
nature
of
the
malt
profile
overpowers
some
of
the
other
flavours
but
having
said
that
i
do
like
it
overall
this
is
good
but
not
great
id
drink
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
serving
type
bottle
overall
ill
give
dragonhead
stout
orkney
brewery
a
4
75
i
thought
it
would
have
a
slight
astringency
due
to
the
brewerys
home
nation
take
on
most
beers
but
this
was
smooth
the
whole
way
through
as
a
huge
fan
of
vikingfolk
metal
this
certainly
caught
my
eyes
at
the
local
bottle
shop
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
offering
by
orkney
brewery
and
plan
on
purchasing
and
reviewing
more
of
their
products
in
the
near
future
from
bottle
with
freshness
date
in
2015
pours
a
very
dark
peaty
colour
almost
black
with
a
head
so
offwhite
i
might
call
it
beige
the
nose
is
not
much
to
write
home
about
a
little
chalky
with
a
hint
of
white
wine
and
some
roasted
malt
notes
maybe
even
a
hint
of
smoky
bacon
crisp
flavouring
this
has
more
bite
than
most
english
stouts
tasting
quite
acidic
to
start
turning
slightly
plummy
with
a
pleasant
smoky
woody
and
slightly
spicy
aftertaste
the
more
i
drink
the
spicier
and
more
tobacco
infused
it
seems
it
isnt
bland
which
seems
to
be
the
pitfall
of
many
lower
abv
stouts
it
is
on
the
somewhat
carbonated
rather
than
silky
smooth
side
overall
this
is
good
stuff
which
is
just
as
well
because
i
have
a
few
more
bottles
of
it
this
would
be
an
easy
drinking
stout
at
4
if
the
bitter
chocolate
taste
were
less
prominent
and
the
price
point
lower
5
99500
ml
however
this
meets
the
criteria
for
a
stout
well
and
must
be
judged
accordingly
o
a
briny
mineral
tastes
starts
to
creep
up
as
you
drink
through
the
pint
but
it
plays
well
off
of
the
acrid
malt
flavors
a
solid
pint
from
beginning
to
end
taste
wise
it
followed
the
smells
this
is
a
rich
smooth
stout
with
a
fair
amount
of
sweetness
running
through
it
the
dry
finish
compliments
the
nutty
hints
within
the
coffee
and
chocolate
flavours
to
give
you
a
reminder
that
the
brewer
hasnt
forgotten
to
add
some
hops
into
his
kettle
the
taste
has
a
good
hang
around
the
bonfire
burnt
malt
flavor
going
on
with
light
bitterness
coming
up
on
the
backside
quite
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
would
have
again
overall
i
rate
anything
that
gets
me
buzzed
and
doesnt
taste
like
nighttrain
over
a
4
i
like
beer
most
beer
this
is
beer
but
its
on
the
low
end
of
beer
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
it
doesnt
suit
me
much
ill
still
drink
it
i
liked
the
other
one
the
dark
island
much
more
a
very
nice
mild
stout
has
a
bit
of
nice
hops
which
works
well
as
the
balance
is
very
solid
drinks
very
nicely
actually
would
recommend
this
as
a
flavorful
session
stout
good
brew
4
sampled
from
a
500ml
bottle
a
deep
dark
beer
with
a
small
beige
head
nice
malty
aromas
with
a
flavor
that
follows
malts
dominate
the
experience
with
a
rich
flavor
up
front
and
a
dry
finish
the
flavor
is
big
and
rewarding
despite
the
4
alcohol
creamy
satisfying
and
refreshing
o
enjoyable
stout
worth
checking
out
velvety
smooth
and
creamy
on
the
mouth
with
a
light
feel
to
it
overall
a
pleasant
change
of
pace
from
the
norm
of
bigger
and
bolder
american
stouts
packs
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
in
a
small
4
abv
package
the
taste
seems
lacking
in
sweetness
which
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
other
stouts
ive
tried
seem
more
wellrounded
there
is
a
very
interesting
rich
roasted
maltiness
and
just
enough
hoppy
sharpness
to
make
this
stout
a
plus
on
my
list
in
spite
of
the
dry
finish
overall
a
brilliant
stout
that
is
to
be
tried
by
anybody
even
vaguely
interested
in
darker
beer
however
the
intensity
of
its
flavours
means
that
such
people
should
perhaps
warm
themselves
up
with
contemporary
stouts
such
as
guinness
or
murphys
before
abandoning
the
sweetness
and
nitrocarbonation
for
the
rich
smokiness
and
experience
of
dragonhead
another
fine
brew
by
the
lads
at
orkney
overall
i
would
have
scored
much
lower
but
really
this
is
ama
amazing
beer
for
4
percent
very
very
nice
nose
definitely
pour
this
one
into
a
snifter
low
alcohol
and
sits
kind
of
heavy
but
is
nice
for
those
afternoons
up
north
at
the
cabin
when
youre
just
kicking
back
and
relaxing
kind
of
has
a
smoky
taste
to
it
very
unique
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
pours
a
typically
black
colour
with
a
healthy
brownbeige
head
the
nose
is
very
scottish
and
suggests
the
seaocean
and
smoke
on
the
palate
it
is
notably
dry
with
smokeyearthydirt
notes
definitely
a
unique
dry
stout
in
many
regards
it
has
many
characteristics
of
much
bigger
imperial
stouts
but
is
very
modest
alcoholwise
good
body
smooth
aftertaste
great
flavors
that
are
different
from
most
american
stouts
i
have
tried
this
one
definitely
bears
its
scottish
label
of
origin
proudly
this
looks
quite
good
at
first
glance
but
the
eventual
strange
fruitiness
in
all
its
underwhelming
sideshowiness
kind
of
mars
an
otherwise
decent
stout
what
with
its
inherent
chocolate
tendencies
oh
well
i
guess
that
this
is
just
one
of
those
easier
to
drink
than
analyze
offerings
hey
it
happens
i
poured
the
beer
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
the
beer
was
dark
almost
black
the
head
had
a
tan
color
i
couldnt
smell
anything
my
sense
of
smell
is
weak
hence
the
average
rating
i
could
taste
roasted
malt
and
coffee
the
beer
felt
light
in
my
mouth
and
went
down
easy
i
note
the
alcohol
level
was
low
i
didnt
pick
up
any
alcohol
warmth
which
i
would
expect
for
that
level
of
alcohol
an
easy
drinking
good
tasting
stout
500ml

spotty

toasted

flavor
in
the

by

medium

low

sweet

then
coffee
returns
nice
drinkability
unfortunately
this
pretty
gentle
stout
results
quite
cloying
finally
d
this
was
a
good
traditional
english
stout
the
scent
and
taste
and
body
were
all
pretty
simple
but
nice
the
finish
was
fairly
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
not
an
impressive
beer
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
easy
going
down
very
enjoyable
with
the
porter
cheese
lots
of
flavor
and
a
nice
easydrinking
abv
no
idea
what
the
bottle
cost
but
if
its
reasonable
id
buy
this
again
there
is
the
smallest
detection
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
o
a
good
roasted
stout
could
use
a
richer
body
but
nicely
sessionable
given
the
low
abv
d
i
do
enjoy
lightbodied
dark
beers
rather
counterintuitive
to
most
nice
having
a
stout
that
it
is
so
easy
drinking
o
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
and
i
was
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
drink
a
style
i
dont
get
often
the
biggest
thing
i
will
take
from
this
is
the
great
peat
smoke
finish
that
reminds
me
of
a
nice
glass
of
laphroaig
highly
recommended
o
overall
very
tasty
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
as
was
evident
by
the
abv
id
buy
this
again
for
sure
poured
a
rich
dark
chocolate
in
colour
with
minimal
head
that
left
a
lot
of
lacing
smelled
very
much
of
sarsparilla
caramel
and
chocolate
taste
of
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
spicy
bitter
finish
a
little
lighter
on
the
mouthfeel
than
most
stouts
carbonation
not
too
heavy
quite
drinkable
cheers
overall
drinkability
a
stout
at
4
a
sessionable
stout
indeed
i
think
the
only
thing
im
no
too
crazy
about
with
this
beer
is
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
but
besides
that
its
a
nice
beer
that
i
think
would
be
fantastic
on
cask
or
on
tap
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
another
one
of
these
over
a
course
of
an
evening
and
even
more
so
with
the
right
meal
orkney
brewery
dragonhead
stout
pours
with
a
black
colour
and
a
decent
enough
head
that
fades
to
sparse
lacing
the
smell
is
very
weak
but
i
smell
some
roasted
malt
maybe
some
bitter
coffee
maybe
the
flavour
is
sour
and
sharp
up
front
with
some
some
charcoal
in
the
middle
the
finish
is
sour
and
smokey
the
texture
is
nice
and
frothy
overall
i
didnt
like
this
stout
that
much
too
sour
and
smokey
o
the
beer
is
very
flavorful
considering
its
low
alcohol
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
because
it
is
very
sessionable
prepare
yourself
for
a
showcase
of
carbonized
malt
with
this
one
a
mans
drink
d
i
cant
get
past
the
scotch
comparison
if
you
enjoy
the
type
of
flavors
in
scotch
you
may
dig
this
brew
if
you
think
scotch
is
nasty
you
probably
wont
enjoy
this
drinkability
pretty
easy
overall
and
wood
be
good
with
some
traditional
irish
fare
and
desserts
body
is
very
watery
poured
a
deep
ruby
opaque
black
sweet
roasted
malts
dominated
this
beer
with
a
long
lasting
head
and
lace
this
is
a
malty
stout
with
subdued
coffe
taste
that
is
dominated
by
firm
malt
base
bittering
was
a
bit
low
for
the
style
but
still
this
is
a
outstanding
beer
nice
firm
body
smooth
and
quite
balanced
an
easier
drinker
for
sure
nothing
heavy
or
cloying
about
this
one
you
could
knock
back
pints
of
this
all
night
there
are
other
stouts
that
i
like
more
but
would
not
refuse
this
one
ill
have
this
again
drinkability
about
what
you
would
expect
from
an
english
stout
perhaps
its
coincidental
that
the
two
best
uk
breweries
in
my
opinion
are
in
scotland
harviestoun
and
orkney
and
with
the
truly
exceptional
dragonhead
stout
orkney
may
have
pulled
ever
so
slightly
ahead
of
harviestoun
if
it
werent
so
expensive
here
in
the
usa
id
drink
this
with
every
meal
well
thats
a
bit
of
hyperbole
but
you
get
the
point
from
the
opaque
clarinetblack
color
to
the
aromas
of
coffee
chocolate
rope
and
lemons
from
the
roasty
front
end
to
the
citrus
tail
end
this
is
a
uk
stout
without
peer
im
now
on
a
quest
to
drink
the
entire
orkney
line
d
very
drinkable
for
as
strong
tasting
as
it
is
d
it
goes
well
with
barbeque
sunflower
seeds
so
thats
something
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
its
sweet
an
mildly
bitter
but
its
mostly
roasty
at
the
back
its
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
but
overall
its
a
repeatable
good
session
stout
i
would
drink
it
again
definitely
drinkable
very
good
stout
taste
a
nice
treat
on
a
cool
summers
eve
d
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
that
makes
it
nice
to
revisit
from
time
to
time
d
a
different
take
on
stout
very
tasty
but
fairly
expensive
still
a
darn
fine
beer
clean
finish
and
very
drinkable
good
almost
creamy
body
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
example
of
an
english
would
have
this
regularly
if
it
wasnt
so
damn
expensive
for
a
session
beer
taste
is
definitely
smoky
with
a
little
peat
and
fruit
to
go
along
uniquely
odd
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
somewhat
thin
mouthfeel
and
the
finish
is
so
light
it
disappears
superfast
mild
roast
and
a
fair
amount
of
chocolate
with
a
substantial
dusty
chalk
flavor
as
it
warms
sweetness
is
low
but
ample
has
a
myriad
of
flavors
that
is
for
sure
but
the
steep
pricetag
of
5
75
would
prevent
me
from
purchasing
this
very
often
overall
pretty
good
stout
not
intense
or
heavy
but
nice
and
fruity
with
some
good
smoke
looks
and
smells
great
but
it
isnt
such
a
great
stout
from
this
usually
lovely
orcadian
brewery
still
it
does
have
a
bit
of
uniqueness
to
it
that
makes
it
certainly
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
nice
dark
black
colour
what
you
hope
for
from
a
good
english
stout
pretty
good
head
retention
lots
of
coffee
bean
smell
and
smells
like
a
stout
should
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
maybe
a
little
astringency
and
not
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
for
maybe
could
use
with
a
higher
abv
leaves
a
nice
smokey
taste
in
the
mouth
though
overall
pretty
solid
the
dark
island
from
these
guys
is
better
though
d
good
for
style
but
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
d
not
the
most
complex
stout
but
a
mild
and
highly
drinkable
one
absolutely
thirst
quenching
and
at
4
i
can
have
my
stout
nutrition
without
a
ton
of
booze
flavor
improves
as
it
warms
up
but
id
rather
chug
it
out
of
a
giant
viking
helmet
i
would
love
to
visit
the
brewery
however
i
could
see
myself
slamming
low
alcohol
dragonhheads
with
viking
descendents
in
remote
little
corner
of
the
world
that
orkney
must
be
and
offering
a
more
charitable
review
after
the
experience
very
drinkable
for
a
stout
subtle
burnt
character
and
nice
dark
flavours
but
smooth
english
and
polite
i
enjoy
this
even
though
im
not
blown
away
by
the
flavour
a
really
excellent
and
very
enjoyable
little
brew
smooth
deep
and
delectable
with
plenty
of
character
to
boot
its
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
incredibly
smoothly
very
very
enjoyable
d
damn
good
taste
and
the
abv
would
allow
you
to
session
all
night
long
really
is
a
solid
low
abv
stout
love
the
way
this
brewery
displays
their
beers
in
nice
looking
bottles
with
good
labels
front
and
back
that
tell
you
something
about
the
beer
and
their
reason
for
producing
it
if
i
could
award
a
score
for
presentation
for
the
bottle
of
this
brewereies
beer
they
would
prob
score
a

an

with
massive
hints
of
nice
roasted
dark
coffee
and
chestnuts
flooding
the
palette
which
culminates
in
the
end
with
some
spicy
hops
to
make
this
beer
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
d
could
drink
this
all
night
but
would
take
me
awhile
on
each
d
very
easy

definitely
will
be
keeping

in

it

i
would
call
for

overall
this
is
a
nice

for
a
beer
that
could
be

this
bottled
version
isnt
the
typical
viking
ship
name

made
me
secondguess
whether
to
pick
this
one
up
from
the
shop
but
the
fact
that
it
was
from
orkney
alleviated
any
immediate
misgivings
a

at

the
flavor
held
the
above
but
with
a
nice

smoked

flavor
and
hint
of
saltwater
and
seaweed
which
definitely
gave
it
some
character
did
not
detract
from
the
experience
there
was
definitely
the
undertone
of
a
nice
smoky
single

that
my

noted
was
unique
and
wonderful
but
not

be
peerless
a
musttry
beer
if
you
have
the
chance
very
suitable
for
hunkering
down
in
the
latest
atlantic
storm
overall
this
is
one
of
the
most
delicious
beers
ive
had
its
brewed
like
a
stout
with
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
barley
but
also
has
wheat
coriander
and
orange
zest
its
an
interesting
combination
between
two
styles
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
was
hightened
by
my
football
team
winning
60
as
i
reviewed
it
tasty
and
really
easy
drinking
for
a
stout
and
all
this
from
a
humble
bottle
of
beer
i
would
just
love
to
try
the
cask
reminds
me
yet
again
i
need
to
be
reold
and
retold
this
that
stouts
are
more
than
just
all
consuming
booze
and
weight
o
this
was
a
strange
one
ive
never
tried
a
scottish
ale
with
such
a
strong
roasty
charcoal
presence
i
liked
though
and
im
very
glad
i
got
to
try
sometrhine
so
unique
o
certainly
one
of
the
better
cask
beers
ive
come
across
wonderfully
drinkable
creamy
and
downable
definitely
recommended
o
a
decent
stout
and
certainly
more
characterful
than
some
of
their
other
brews
looks
alright
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
replete
with
roasted
malt
and
coffee
notes
a
solid
bitterness
rounds
it
off
nicely
body
is
ok
but
could
stand
to
be
a
shade
creamier
goes
down
easily
enough
worth
sampling
if
you
have
the
chance
i
like
this
stout
from
lancaster
and
ill
buy
more
as
long
as
its
in
town
o
an
acceptable
stout
with
a
fine
aroma
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
smoky
aroma
has
notes
of
licorice
molasses
and
coffee
plus
a
strange
yeasty
almost
plasticlike
overtone
but
this
may
be
from
something
odd
that
happened
to
this
particular
batch
it
pours
a
nice
opaque
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
if
not
too
persistent
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
generous
lacing
flavor
has
a
strong
smoky
note
plus
tones
of
licorice
molasses
and
coffee
and
a
hint
of
unsweet
chocolate
the
mysterious
plasticish
note
seems
to
diminish
as
i
consume
the
beer
smooth
texture
has
firm
body
and
a
good
amount
of
fizz
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
but
still
pleasing
poor
well
worth
a
poke
from
the
25
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
november
22
2011
it
pours
dark
mahoganybrown
with
some
nice
clarity
an
adequate
head
a
little
lacing
i
think
i
expected
something
more
opaque
the
aroma
is
definitely
pungent
but
not
in
the
aromas
typical
to
a
stout
it
is
more
like
sweet
malts
molasses
and
black
licorice
the
body
was
thin
to
medium
sweet
on
the
front
end
but
somewhat
bitter
on
the
end
i
think
i
would
liken
it
more
to
an
irish
black
lager
than
a
stout
o
this
was
just
painful
to
drink
o
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
a
bit
underrated
but
i
also
wish
it
were
more
consistent
across
the
board
a
nice
appearance
and
an
outstanding
flavor
profile
coupled
with
a
hohum
nose
and
mouthfeel
reduce
what
could
have
been
an
outstanding
english
stout
to
merely
an
aboveaverage
english
stout
this
seems
to
be
a
fine
example
of
the
style
overall
with
generous
roasted
barley
characteristics
all
around
an
ok
english
stout
but
lacks
depth
drinkability
and
appearance
are
great
but
slightly
less
carb
could
tone
down
the
astringency
for
an
improvement
d
a
decent
brew
but
not
something
id
want
to
have
a
whole
lot
of
this
would
be
much
better
from
a
cask
this
is
a
true
english
stout
some
good
characteristics
but
for
the
price
tag
i
wont
be
picking
up
lancaster
black
again
very
low
abv
and
nothing
bad
about
this
make
this
incredibly
drinkable
however
nothing
about
this
is
exceptionally
out
of
the
ordinary
so
im
not
sure
how
often
id
revisit
this
ebony
with
cherry
highlights
when
backlit
and
a
slight
sand
colored
head
that
shrinks
to
a
skim
of
foam
and
leaves
sheets
of
fine
lace
on
the
glass
dark
chocolate
and
roasty
and
smokey
malt
notes
in
the
aroma
cocoa
anise
and
smoked
malt
with
faint
herbal
hop
bittering
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
harmonious
if
slightly
underwhelming
lighter
bodied
and
smooth
easy
drinking
and
tasty
a
good
english
session
ale
atmosphere
is
pretty
solid
pretty
nice
appearance
deep
and
rich
with
a
full
head
nose
is
really
decent
as
well
nice
combination
of
grain
and
sweet
components
flavor
is
full
with
a
subtle
sweet
character
feel
is
a
bit
washed
out
and
not
the
best
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
quaff
overall
as
stouts
go
its
not
a
bad
one
if
youre
looking
for
something
with
an
insanely
complex
flavour
profile
then
youre
in
the
wrong
place
however
if
youre
after
a
good
drinkable
stout
which
is
a
cut
above
the
typical
irish
offerings
then
this
is
a
good
bet
widely
available
and
well
worth
checking
out
quite
soft
gentle
fine
dark
and
rich
o
this
is
a
great
supermarket
stout
focuses
on
doing
the
basics
right
recommended
gorgeous
beer
but
hoppier
and
bubblier
than
expected
fairly
bland
and
onetone
though
drinkable
o
the
flavors
of
this
stout
seem
to
strengthen
as
it
warms
up
it
is
rather
flavorful
considering
its
body
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
87
mo
in
general
the
carbonation
level
is
executed
pretty
well
although
the
body
feels
at
times
thinner
than
perhaps
desirably
so
all
in
all
this
double
stout
has
retained
a
moderate
body
and
flavour
profile
crafted
in
a
way
that
the
balance
in
flavour
good
level
of
dryish
bitterness
and
approachable
drinkability
make
it
a
sessiontype
stout
one
pint
is
definitely
not
enough
at
any
sitting
to
me
at
least
a
pretty
standard
stout
the
flavours
were
much
as
i
had
expected
going
in
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
darker
malts
and
the
roasted
flavours
but
the
palate
was
a
little
harsh
and
the
carbonation
also
seemed
off
meaning
the
beer
wasnt
as
smooth
or
as
easy
to
drink
as
i
would
have
liked
lots
of
great
components
a
great
stout
really
enjoyed
this
the
flavour
is
barely
okay
considering
this
was
marked
higher
than
the
prices
on
the
other
supermarket
beers
next
to
it
this
makes
it
a
fail
probably
shepherd
neames
best
beer
clever
beer
this
one
an
oyster
stout
also
brewed
with
clams
i
expected
a
way
more
seafoody
beer
i
almost
expected
this
to
be
gross
but
i
was
so
curious
i
had
to
grab
it
pours
like
a
nice
rich
stout
dark
mocha
head
on
a
big
black
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
there
save
the
high
viscosity
and
low
alcohol
the
nose
shows
some
light
briny
saltiness
but
its
less
about
the
sea
as
it
is
about
the
protein
added
from
these
little
critters
they
add
a
ton
of
body
without
a
ton
of
fishiness
not
at
all
what
i
was
anticipating
in
this
one
there
ids
a
coffee
smelling
side
here
and
its
a
little
weird
with
the
oceanic
properties
but
it
comes
together
in
the
flavor
where
its
less
of
a
raw
bar
and
more
of
a
chargrilled
shellfish
profile
the
dark
malt
helps
to
balance
and
all
that
protein
gives
the
beer
a
slick
yet
large
body
interesting
to
say
the
least
the
finish
is
remarkably
dry
for
what
it
is
and
the
beer
on
the
whole
is
very
good
never
though
clams
would
make
a
good
addition
especially
to
this
type
of
beer
i
dont
love
love
it
but
i
really
admire
it
more
cleverness
for
the
italians
it
would
be
neat
to
see
this
done
in
a
series
or
beers
all
with
one
accent
flavor
for
shellfish
curry
herbs
wine
could
be
even
more
interesting
in
terms
of
food

fits
for
the
style
as
an
english
variant
though
i
understand
the
american
urge
to
beef
up
the
body
it
has
a
tangy
sharpish
semidry
finish
b
im
fairly
new
to
beers
other
than
your
run
of
the
mill
pilsner
types
so
my
review
will
be
very
simple
this
beer
was
salty
it
was
slightly
fishy
oystery
which
i
believe
was
the
point
but
the
overwhelming
characteristic
for
me
was
salt
i
wont
have
it
again
pretty
enjoyable
stout
od
an
interesting
beer
but
fairly
difficult
to
get
through
the
entire
bottle
not
bad
but
the
minerality
of
it
made
it
hard
to
drink
neat
to
see
the
effects
of
the
oysters
but
not
worth
much
beyond
the
experiment
this
is
actually
an
oyster
stout
but
felt
this
was
closest
given
i
didnt
have
the
option
of
the
first
and
pours
the
darkest
kola
hue
which
leaves
a
two
finger
khaki
laced
head
and
heaps
of
nice
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
salty
sea
waterdark
rich
chocolateherbal
hops
and
dark
roasty
coffeethe
mouthfeel
is
just
under
medium
bodied
and
a
touch
slippery
not
what
i
expect
in
my
stouts
but
due
to
the
oysters
i
can
understand
and
has
tastes
of
dark
rich
chocolatedark
milky
coffeecocoa
nibsdark
plumsa
touch
of
chocolate
coated
cherries
and
finished
with
a
touch
of
saltiness
that
leaves
your
mouth
dry
and
wanting
another
sip
and
overall
its
alright
and
the
oysters
definately
let
themselves
known
thats
for
sure
and
even
for
someone
like
me
whos
not
the
biggest
fan
of
oysters
i
must
admit
i
dont
get
the
oyster
taste
just
the
sea
saltiness
and
even
though
i
would
not
rush
out
and
buy
it
again
i
can
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is

my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
1252013
purchased
at
super
h
mart
a
korean
market
in
dallas
it
drinks
more
like
a
dark
lager
than
a
stout
not
bad
was
stoked
to
try
a
korean
stout
but
this
was
disappointing
medium
brown
in
color
this
looks
a
lot
more
like
a
brown
ale
than
a
stout
and
its
small
tan
head
dies
fast
smell
and
taste
are
the
same
watery
chocolate
malt
and
a
generic
ale
yeast
with
a
metallic
finish
and
moderate
bitterness
long
and
dry
as
it
swallows
and
just
way
too
light
in
body
to
fit
the
stout
style
in
any
way
a
passable
dark
ale
but
an
utter
failure
as
a
stout
none
of
the
three
hite
beers
i
had
were
awful
but
none
of
them
were
stand
out
either
preferable
to
other
asian
imports
but
thats
about
it
poured
into
an
elysian
snifter
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
nearly
black
in
the
glass
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
faint
aroma
of
toasted
malt
coffee
with
a
slight
sourness
flavor
is
better
than
the
aroma
but
very
attenuated
faint
dark
toasted
malt
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
finishes
very
light
with
memories
of
dark
malt
light
bodied
but
decent
carbonation
an
odd
little
beer
for
a
brief
moment
after
tasting
all
the
right
elements
of
an
english
stout
are
present
although
subdued
but
flavor
fades
away
to
a
very
light
finish
this
tastes
like
a
high
production
english
stout
that
has
been
slightly
watered
down
it
has
potential
if
the
pleasant
flavors
present
would
be
more
intense
and
with
a
bit
more
body
i
suspect
this
would
still
be
a
locally
welcome
beer
compared
to
many
of
the
very
light
asian
beers
worth
a
try
and
drinkable
but
most
other
stouts
would
be
a
better
choice
i
would
rate
this
higher
compared
strictly
to
other
beers
from
this
continent
but
it
is
labelled
as
a
stout
and
has
to
stand
up
in
that
company
o
a
bummer
but
slightly
better
than
a
lot
of
asian
beers
the
only
reason
to
take
it
would
be
if
you
are
in
asia
and
have
few
choices
generally
weak
but
some
nice
stout
qualities
still
there
o
this
is
very
bad
totally
entirely
not
good
it
isnt
even
that
it
just
doesnt
have
much
going
on
its
that
what
is
going
on
is
boring
and
somewhat
caustic
to
my
taste
buds
i
wont
be
having
this
again
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
char
and
some
slight
metallic
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
somewhat
thin
flavor
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
but
fairly
drinkable
for
what
it
is
overall
i
will
probably
never
see
this
one
again
it
is
by
no
means
the
worst
i
have
had
but
i
have
had
a
lot
better
also
o
nowhere
near
my
ideal
stout
but
not
without
its
charm
strange
thinness
both
in
appearance
and
feel
cant
outweigh
a
fairly
tasty
and
drinkable
enough
beer
that
is
ok
alone
and
probably
pairs
pretty
well
with
a
number
of
korean
dishes
not
gonna
run
out
and
buy
more
but
for
under
2
the
bottle
wasnt
a
disappointment
give
black
beer
stout
several
chances
if
youre
in
korea
if
not
you
probably
wont
find
it
nor
will
you
ever
think
of
touching
it
even
if
it
is
4
a
sixer
i
love
this
beer
im
not
in
love
with
it
i
love
it
as
a
friend
that
im
forced
to
hang
out
with
ya
know
d
drinkability
implies
that
is
it
is
possible
to
drink
i
guess
this
beer
does
meet
that
qualification
just
enough
for
a
two
this
beer
is
to
stout
what
shasta
is
to
coke
d
this
is
more
like
a
light
black
lager
i
guess
you
gotta
give
hite
some
props
for
making
a
brownish
beer
in
a
land
of
piss
water
but
calling
it
a
stout
is
blasphemy
nevertheless
i
didnt
spit
it
out
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
had
a
decent
light
tan
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
ring
pretty
quickly
smell
is
very
faint
malt
and
grain
taste
is
very
watery
for
a
stout
and
a
little
bitter
overall
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
macro
beers
ive
had
from
a
korean
brewery
its
not
great
but
its
definitely
more
drinkable
than
the
other
korean
offerings
all
in
all
im
glad
i
tried
this
taste
is
watery
malt
some
cocoa
and
slightly
bitter
i
have
to
admit
i
set
my
expectations
quite
low
for
this
one
just
by
looking
at
the
clear
bottle
couldnt
be
more
wrong
the
beer
looks
pitch
black
with
small
head
after
the
pour
though
with
great
retention
nice
smells
quite
interesting
the
usual
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
tones
are
supported
by
some
kind
of
acidic
aroma
which
is
reminding
me
of
dark
fruits
which
i
find
quite
pleasant
in
the
mouth
feels
very
creamy
with
small
amount
of
bubbles
the
taste
is
pretty
unusual
for
a
stout
usual
coffee
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
are
there
but
the
backbone
is
still
sweet
acidic
dark
fruity
lasts
vey
long
revealing
some
small
amount
of

would
buy
this
again
poured
from
a

into
a
chilled

very

i
wouldnt

with

the
outstanding

the

the

everything
but
the

of
the

was
actually
really
awesome
the

coupled

that
i
probably
end
up

this

again

brew
from

i
have
been
a
big
fan
of
belhaven
scottish
ale
for
a
long
time
when
i
found
this
on
the
shelf
i
was
quite
excited
i
wasnt
disappointed
it
poured
very
dark
garnetblack
good
offwhite
head
and
nice
malty
aroma
from
the
first
sip
i
was
impressed
nice
mouthfeel
not
too
chewy
but
nice
body
the
flavor
was
chocolate
vanilla
and
slight
roastiness
truly
even
though
the
bottle
says
belhaven
scottish
stout
it
is
a
porter
a
strong
porter
but
still
a
porter
they
even
say
so
on
their
website
it
does
not
have
the
coffee
overtones
associated
with
stouts
this
one
of
my
favorites
slainte
o
pretty
good
although
the
flavors
dont
quite
come
together
yep
this
is
a
sweet
beer
deal
with
it
unlike
many
other
reviewers
i
dont
expect
every
beer
i
drink
to
be
hoppy
or
bitter
its
nice
to
have
a
sweet
malt
beer
sometimes
and
this
doesnt
disappoint
there
for
me
it
goes
down
easy
and
tastes
better
as
it
warms
up
great
for
in
the
winter
sitting
at
a
pub
on
a
cold
evening
malty
sweet
dark
tasty
scotch
import
i
was
lucky
to
get
it
on
tap
during
beer
week
ill
have
one
more

abv
hits
you
aftershock
o
not
my
favorite
of
the
different
styles
of
stout
but
this
is
avery
nice
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
enjoyable
beer
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
and
i
could
easily
sip
of
these
all
afternoon
while
watching
some
soccer
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
below
average
english
stout
it
seems
like
most
of
the
english
beers
i
have
tried
lately
all
have
this
super
sweet
malt
profile
that
seems
to
take
over
any
features
of
the
particular
style
and
dominate
the
aroma
and
taste
that
is
pretty
much
what
happened
here
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
the
sweetness
is
far
too
high
for
me
to
finish
the
whole
bottle
glad
i
got
my
brother
to
help
me
out
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
looked
like
a
proper
english
stout
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
high
amount
of
sweetness
it
was
just
way
too
sweet
for
the
style
and
the
sweetness
seemed
to
drown
out
most
of
the
other
flavors
and
aromas
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
pretty
cheap
but
even
at
the
bargain
price
of
1
39
a
bottle
it
doesnt
really
warrant
a
repeat
purchase
not
recommended
this
beer
turned
out
to
be
a
let
down
i
just
dont
get
how
sweet
all
these
english
styled
beers
i
have
tried
are
and
almost
all
of
them
seem
to
have
that
maybe
i
just
dont
like
the
style
but
i
have
had
some
that
arent
so
i
know
it
can
be
done
not
a
good
first
impression
for
this
brewery
i
dont
think
i
will
be
revisiting
them
again
anytime
soon
overall
i
am
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
off
and
it
is
a
little
too
sweet
this
is
a
very
dark
beer
i
couldnt
even
see
threw
the
drops
the
dripped
on
the
counter
had
to
really
get
my
noise
in
to
it
to
get
the
smell
of
coffee
and
malt
the
taste
was
a
bit
better
got
some
chocolate
and
roast
flavors
good
beer
but
not
much
to
have
it
really
stand
out
from
other
stouts
really
didnt
get
that
scottish
style
from
this
one
but
as
i
said
not
bad
the
only
downside
was
the
bitterness
present
at
the
end
of
each
drink
what
starts
with
a
very
good
look
and
smell
ends
with
a
pretty
strong
dose
of
bitter
i
know
that
this
is
typical
to
the
style
but
it
hurts
what
is
otherwise
a
very
good
beer
pours
a
dark
ale
with
two
fingers
of
latte
foam
this
falls
slowly
to
a
quilt
of
the
same
leaving
lots
of
cobwebs
very
roasty
nose
plenty
of
dark
coffee
charcoal
malts
and
even
nearly
a
savory
almost
salty
smell
really
a
rich
nose
very
roasty
flavor
as
well
with
stone
fruit
umami
coffee
oatmeal
some
catty
hops
and
even
a
little
thyme
flavor
i
like
this
beer
so
far
really
crushable
as
a
stout
a
little
short
of
full
bodied
with
moderate
but
short
lived
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
with
hi
potential
for
being
paired
with
fire
broiled
red
meats
taters
and
some
veggies
good
stuff
o
delicious
it
is
more
americanized
than
i
expected
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
at
5
a
22oz
its
a
good
value
as
well
lighter
in
the
mouthfeel
than
most
of
this
brews
american
cousins
but
it
does
not
detract
unusual
to
have
a
good
beer
out
of
a
clear
bottle
but
i
didnt
detect
any
skunkiness
a
solid
stout
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
an
easy
drinking
sipper
for
a
dogfish
head
snifter
belhaven
scottish
stout
would
also
stand
up
to
a
meal
a
nice
porter
not
the
stoutish
dryness
tastes
much
more
robustdry
hops
acidic
yeast
and
a
sweet
chocolately
malt
it
begins
with
a
surprisingly
nice
node
of
pasteurization
which
moves
into
chocolate
then
a
blend
of
sour
and
dry
very
nicely
balanced
o
good
stout
the
balanced
smokiness
sets
it
apart
well
worth
a
try

unexpectedly
excellent
stout
smooth
and
drinkable
without
the
heaviness
one
usually
expects
from
a
stout
however
all
the
excellent
stout
characteristics
are
present
and
are
very
rewarding
recommended
o
my
first
english
stout
and
a
good
one
at
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
light
but
complex
flavors
great
mouthfeel
not
something
id
ever
seek
out
specifically
again
but
wasnt
regretting
the
order
by
any
means
has
this
beer
at
the
pub
in
ft
lauderdale
fl
it
was
served
in
the
traditional
stout
pint
glass
with
a
one
inch
tan
head
the
head
is
thick
and
foamy
guaranteed
to
leave
a
stout
mustache
the
color
of
this
stout
reminds
me
of
pitch
and
has
the
thickness
and
consistency
of
molasses
all
of
this
leads
to
my
first
quaff
of
beer
that
is
very
smooth
with
flavors
of
chocolate
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
licorice
this
beer
is
much
more
intense
and
creamy
tha
guinness
really
love
this
beer
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
simpler
rounded
europeanstyle
stout
although
its
hop
presence
could
step
forward
more
than
it
does
solid
effort
from
belhaven
aroma
is
smoky
like
a
good
stout
with
a
floral
hint
and
tones
of
coffee
and
wood
it
pours
a
deep
warm
sable
that
is
a
little
translucent
at
the
very
edges
and
has
a
thick
finebubbled
fairly
persistent
light
tan
head
that
pillows
in
the
middle
after
a
bit
smoky
flavor
has
woody
unsweet
chocolate
and
fruity
tones
firmbodied
texture
has
a
fair
amount
of
fizz
and
leaves
a
burnt
wood
finish
overall
not
too
shabby
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
blackish
brown
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
light
chocolate
aromas
along
with
some
earthy
roasted
aromas
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
on
the
sweeter
side
not
much
bitterness
in
here
at
all
the
mouthfeel
isnt
overly
heavy
at
all
its
probably
medium
bodied
and
has
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
decent
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
came
across
it
not
real
experinced
on
stouts
but
this
beer
was
really
smooth
good
hopiness
good
bit
of
smokenutty
smell
chocolate
flavor
prevelant
not
much
head
though
alcohol
taste
not
a
factor
which
is
good
in
my
book
overall
one
of
the
top
stouts
i
have
had
a
little
lighter
bodied
than
id
like
but
nice
flavors
nevertheless
in
this
stout
im
also
not
a
fan
of
the
clear
glass
bottle
id
prefer
my
beers
not
to
be
light
struck
thank
you
very
much
pours
very
dark
brown
approaching
black
with
a
somewhat
thin
head
and
no
real
lacing
to
speak
of
nicely
balanced
aromas
of
roasted
grain
cocoa
some
vinous
notes
and
perhaps
a
touch
of
smoke
the
taste
adds
a
creamy
note
and
a
touch
of
malt
to
the
whole
gentle
package
quite
quaffable
and
fairly
surprising
that
this
is
as
strong
as
it
is
very
pleasant
o
i
received
this
beer
from
my
fatherinlaw
after
he
picked
it
up
on
a
trip
i
dont
know
how
much
he
paid
for
the
bottle
but
i
could
definitely
drink
more
of
this
if
the
price
is
not
outrageous
it
had
a
great
balance
of
smoky
peat
and
chocolate
flavors
drink
i
have
been
trying
to
track
down
some
styles
and
this
was
another
one
i
had
missed
this
was
quite
good
with
a
lot
of
chocolate
coming
through
the
hops
add
a
nice
note
and
depth
overall
a
really
nice
beer
soft
and
chocolatey
understated
for
7
great
body
but
too
sweet
with
milk
stout
characteristics
it
could
really
use
some
roast
or
hops
for
balance
im
giving
this
beer
a
b
its
good
but
not
the
best
stout
ive
had
this
is
a
very
good
stout
and
definitely
worth
trying
i
would
go
as
far
as
saying
that
it
is
a
musttry
for
every
stout
lover
overall
easy
drinking
full
flavors
dont
go
overboard
has
that
scottish
peat
in
a
sweet
malt
base
nice
stuff
wow
this
is
why
i
love
stouts
such
rich
and
complex
flavors
that
satisfy
like
no
other
beer
will
bellhaven
delivers
and
then
some
with
this
exceptional
offering
o
a
solid
middle
of
the
road
stout
that
gave
me
what
i
expected
to
get
there
wasnt
anything
overly
complex
or
different
about
it
but
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly

to
medium

coca

turns

it
fills
my
glass
it
has
a
beautiful
and
sudsy
beige
two

head
that
sits
atop
the
beer
for
sometime
the
head
looks
really
nice
the
aromas
featured
are
smooth
dark
roasted

soft
chocolate
and
a
sharp
hop
like
bitterness
after
awhile
the
subtle
chocolaty
aromas
prevail
and
in
almost
a
milky
manner
it
is
initially
sweet
and
bitter

chocolaty
with
a
nice
light
light
roast

the
flavors
blend
well
together
and
make
for
a
nice
light

the
body
is
pretty
light
for
a
stout
but
it
drinks
very
smoothly
im
a
fan
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
worth
the
4
50
or
so
per
bottle
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
well
worth
trying
again
t

be
interested
in
trying
this
one
again
if
i
knew
it

going
to
be

pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
ruby
brown
with
a
2
inch
khaki
head
that
fades
to
an
oily

nice
latticework

after

sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
have
always
seen
on
the
shelf
but
never
picked
up
until
now
my
first
english
stout
and
a
very
good
one
to
start
with
i
will
be
drinking
more
of
these
for
sure
overall
a
fairly
sweet
scottish
stout
with
a
great
mouthfeel
a
nice
surprise
as
i
wasnt
really
expecting
too
much
out
of
this
one
im
belhaving
a
hoot
over
here
d
good
brew
but
not
memorable
this
brew
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
fairly
quickly
recede
aroma
is
of
rich
roasted
coffee
chocolate
peat
and
toasty
malts
a
seriously
exceptional
smelling
stout
the
taste
is
also
very
good
it
has
a
nice
smooth
flavor
of
cocoa
peated
malts
espresso
coffee
toffee
and
roasted
nuts
everything
good
you
want
out
of
a
stout
without
anything
unnecessary
just
a
great
stout
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
very
creamy
fullbodied
and
goes
down
easily
the
drinkability
is
just
great
all
things
taken
this
is
a
great
drinkable
stout
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
overall
pretty
good
balance
with
some
kick
but
not
sour
a
pretty
solid
sweet
stout
nitrogen
is
great
for
certain
types
of
beers
because
it
adds
a
smooth
almost
creamy
texture
with
a
very
light
amount
of
carbonation
something
like
belhaven
scottish
stout
almost
suffers
because
of
it
there
are
some
very
potent
aromas
and
flavors
here
that
dont
mesh
with
the
nitro
texture
its
pretty
good
but
i
wish
i
would
have
gone
with
the
bottle
now
have
it
for
desert
or
an
after
meal
by
the
fire
luxurious
quaff
overall
i
love
this
stout
give
me
more
belhaven
scottish
stout
has
won
multiple
awards
for
excellence
around
the
globe
my
relative
lack
of
enthusiasm
probably
has
more
to
do
with
my
preference
for
americanstyle
stouts
than
with
any
shortcomings
of
this
ale
per
se
since
its
too
expensive
for
regular
consumption
the
choice
is
even
easier
overall
wow
is
this
good
doesnt
seem
like
a
typical
english
stout
theres
a
lot
more
interesting
things
going
on
here
than
your
typical
guinness
the
sweetness
maltiness
and
dryness
are
all
there
but
they
hit
different
notes
sort
of
like
a
song
youve
heard
a
thousand
times
but
reworked
to
bring
out
something
new
and
interesting
very
drinkable
ive
never
seen
this
in
a
store
so
until
i
do
i
guess
ill
be
visiting
the
half
door
more
often
in
all
a
very
enjoyable
stout
though
perhaps
too
heavy
to
have
more
than
1
or
2
this
one
is
so
interesting
and
complex
with
many
flavors
and
tongue
senses
the
lighterthanusualforastout
body
really
assists
in
knocking
this
one
back
quickly
drinkability
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
not
the
best
stout
but
well
made
and
it
made
for
an
enjoyable
drink
easily
drinkable
no
real
presence
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
or
mouthfeel
to
distract
this
could
almost
be
a
session
beer
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
if
you
happen
to
see
it
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
reddish
highlights
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
head
was
very
light
brown
towering
and
foamy
it
smells
of
roasted
coffee
creamy
milk
chocolate
and
licorice
the
taste
is
nice
and
earthy
i
tasted
molasses
lots
of
toasted
malt
there
is
a
slight
smokiness
to
it
and
some
herbal
hops
in
the
background
the
beer
is
thick
and
sticky
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
smooth
stout
hides
the
alcohol
very
well
and
it
has
a
rich
flavor
making
it
highly
drinkable
for
the
abv
d
the
7
abv
is
well
hidden
in
this
smooth
stout
it
goes
down
quite
well
and
lives
up
to
the
labels
promise
of
a
stout
inside
id
call
this
a
sweet
stout
but
its
a
bit
strong
to
style
more
along
the
lines
of
a
foreign
but
that
makes
no
nevermind
try
this
one
drink
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
it
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
definitely
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
checking
out
i
appreciate
getting
the
chance
to
try
it
from
steve
as
ive
heard
good
things
about
the
brewery
but
ive
never
purchased
any
of
their
beers
this
beer
is
good
it
is
neither
exceptional
or
average
just
good
the
color
of
the
body
is
light
dark
to
brown
a
little
unexpected
and
when
poured
in
a
pint
the
crown
is
not
one
to
last
however
this
beer
makes
up
for
it
in
taste
the
smooth
chocolate
flavored
malts
really
elevate
it
above
some
of
its
competitors
the
robust
flavors
and
velvety
smoothness
allow
it
to
be
very
drinkable
putting
it
in
the
category
of
an
everyday
beer
i
could
have
this
beer
anytime
and
would
recommend
highly
as
an
introductory
stout
tasteroasty
black
coffee
subtle
dark
chocolate
creamy
mouthfeel
leadint
to
a
rather
dry
astringent
finish
overall
a
nice
english
stout
though
it
is
listed
as
a
scottish
stout
on
the
bottle
d
a
decent
beer
and
an
easy
drinker
for
7
but
it
was
merely
solid
for
me
good
enough
but
not
great
for
a
7
stout
this
is
extremely
drinkable
the
flavour
is
big
while
being
kept
light
by
the
feel
i
would
totally
pick
this
up
again
impressive
one
of
the
top
stouts
currently
available
here
in
ontario
drinkability
this
is
most
likely
the
most
drinkable
english
stout
i
have
ever
had
very
smooth
amazing
looking
and
with
a
very
pleasant
taste
this
is
a

play
on

of

that

all
over
this

but
so
are
englishlike

flavor
although
the
roast
is
moderate
and
the
molasass
flavor
is
robust
this
is
just
how
youd
expect
a
scottish
stout
to
go
im
not
really
impressed
with

a

d
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
its
simpler
than
american

and
i
enjoy
the
simplicity
of
good
beer
what
a
tasty
english
stout
this
has
to
be
the
best
interpretation
of
the
style
ive
had
to
date
flavourful
and
rich
with
a
nice
body
to
back
it
up
dnot
bad
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
d
this
beer
was
interesting
and
sounded
very
promising
on
the
label
however
it
was
a
bit
thin
and
water
but
the
flavor
that
was
there
was
nice
the
melanoidin
character
was
a
bit
to
strong
and
the
hops
bosed
about
on
the
label
didnt
show
up
in
the
beer
a
very
tasty
after
dinner
beer
but
im
not
sure
id
want
to
session
this
in
light
of
its
sweeter
qualities
still
its
pretty
good
worth
having
again
great
lacing

glass
gets
better
as
it
warms

from

chocolate
also
present
in
the
taste
kind
of
reminded
me
of
root
beer
in
some
instances
which
i
found
to
be
cool
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
d
i
could
have
a
number
of
these
the
clear
bottle
scared
me
a
bit
but
this
was
a
nice
suprise
nothing
wrong
with
this
at
all
and
definately
sessionable
especially
in
winter
d
very
easy
to
drink
overall

solid

to
believe
this
is
a

can
barely

at
all

there

no

alcohol

incredibly
drinkable
decent
stout
overall
i
found
his
very
easy
to
drink
nice
flavors
and
mouthfeel
make
this
a
good
one
to
session
you
dont
notice
the
7
at
all
im
surprised
by
this
one
i
really
didnt
expect
to
find
much
but
this
beer
excels
on
a
number
of
levels
medium
bodied
with
velvety
carbonation
it
feels
smooth
yet
also
relatively
light
for
something
so
richly
flavoured
a
little
bit
more
heft
wouldnt
hurt
it
but
its
pretty
hard
to
nitpick
when
something
tastes
so
damned
good
this
is
fine
just
the
way
it
is
i
like
it
a
lot
just
the
way
it
is
full
flavoured
yet
mellow
great
beer
i
dont
have
actual
proof
that
drinking
stout
is
good
for
you
but
really
how
can
it
not
be
if
not
for
your
health
then
for
your
happiness
the
brewery
has
encouraged
me
to
drink
savor
and
enjoy
which
is
precisely
what
i
did
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
that
encompasses
all
the
rich
flavourful
nature
of
higher
gravity
offerings
without
compromising
the
illimitable
quaffability
of
traditional
versions
highly
recommended
its
quite
nice
good
great
but
for
the
slightly
cloying
sweetness
if
you
like
sweet
things
however
you
are
in
luck

it

and
insanely
drinkable
one

in

frighteningly
drinkable

this
is
a
great
one
to
break
a
newbie
into
the
style
its
not
big

harsh
like
some
others
can
be
and
is
almost

a
delicious
stout

a

good
addition
by
the
lcbo
to
be
honest
i
was
a
bit
let
down
by
this
one
all
of
the
flavours
were
there
but
everything
just
seemed
a
bit
thin
and
the
bit
of
sourness
was

this

its
still

sweet

this
is
a
really

take
on

this
beer
pours
a
nice
super
dark
brown
topped
by
a
beige
foam
that
has
really
beautiful
lacing
the
smell
is
a
bit
off
perhaps
the
hops
are
a
bit
skunked
beneath
that
aroma
there
is
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
caramel
roasted
malts
the
problem
is
that
the
stink
is
too
potent
to
get
it
there
is
a
nice
mild
roast
flavor
to
the
beer
a
bit
of
a
sour
taste
that
you
would
find
in
a
guinness
fairly
smooth
on
the
palate
and
it
is
an
easy
drinking
beer

still
theres
something

a

belhaven
black
scottish
stout
is
not
an
especially
memorable
beer
but
as
far
as
nitro
stouts
go
its
nothing
to
shy
away
from
it
has
a
nicely
balanced
flavour
and
anyone
who
has
had
a
nitro
beer
before
will
already
know
if
theyll
like
the
smooth
mouthfeel
of
this
one
or
not
this
sells
for
slightly
less
than
a
4pack
of
guinness
in
this
market
and
id
certainly
recommend
it
to
any
fans
of
that
brew
seeking
out
something
similar
overall
while
the
aroma
and
appearance
were
both
appealing
the
roasted
malt
and
associated
flavors
that
i
expected
were
anticlimactic
not
bad
though
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
overall
quite
a
decent
brew
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
i
remember
having
this
on

and
it

if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
the
aftertaste
is
lovely
and
pleasant
i
think
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
since
it
isnt
very
strong
and
although
i
waited
57
years
to
have
one
a
belhave
the
next
ones
will
come
soon
and
frequent
canning
this
beer
was
a
smart
move
as
who
knows
how
long
it
took
to
get
here
by
ship
i
generally
tend
to
buy
local
first
but
sometimes
i
like
to
try
stuff
from
abroad
as
well
this
one
was
a
very
good
choice
the
sessionability
of
the
low
abv
is
a
big
plus
for
such
a
flavorful
enjoyable
beer
obviously
i
like
this
stuff
from
hearing
the
widget
releasing
its
contents
to
watching
the
head
build
in
the
18
oz
glass
it
is
a
wonderful
and
beautiful
experience
regarding
taste
it
is
much
the
same
as
similar
products
from
guinness
and
murphys
typical
good
quality
irish
style
dry
stout
that
just
taste
wonderful
from
start
to
finish
everytime
i
open
one
i
say
to
myself
on
the
last
drink
damn
im
gonna
miss
this
brew
it
may
be
my
imagination
but
i
think
belhaven
black
pours
with
more
action
and
the
head
and
lacing
holds
up
till
the
last
drop
when
it
comes
to
the
stouts
of
the
british
isles
ireland
still
wins
my
vote
that
being
said
i
would
certainly
take
belhaven
black
scottish
stout
over
that
most
famous
but
awfully
overrated
export
guinness
this
offering
is
far
more
flavourful
and
a
much
better
option
for
a
night
of
continuous
pints
the
scottish
can
drink
as
well
as
the
irish
after
all
overall
a
pretty
nice
dry
english
stout
perhaps
lacking
the
more
charred
malt
aspect
of
some
of
its
counterparts
but
very
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
the
main
focus
here
it
is
light
sweet
and
creamy
in
fact
it
is
rather
addictive
should
you
get
the
chance
and
find
one
i
am
a
big
fan
of
belhaven
be
it
there
wee
heavy
or
wee
whatever
this
is
a
great
brewery
and
anything
from
there
aresenal
that
can
be
found
will
not
be
a
beer
to
regret
overall
a
solid
stout
in
a
nitro
can
not
bad
but
not
particularly
exciting
i
personally
would
have
enjoyed
a
slightly
heavier
more
viscous
body
overall
a
very
nice
stout
bitterness
is
present
in
a
light
style
refreshing
beer
too
because
is
not
full
bodied
as
other
stouts
and
taste
is
rich
but
moderate
perfect
for
summertime
rjt
overall
a
well
made
nitro
stout
which
has
enough
genuine
flavor
to
stand
up
to
its
competitors
poured
into
a
guiness
pint
glass
jet
black
with
a
creamy
nitro
cascading
light
beige
head
atop
aromas
are
light
with
chocolate
mocha
notes
and
a
bit
of
tin
although
the
nitro
pour
gave
off
a
creaminess
in
the
head
it
was
really
thineven
for
the
the
style
flavors
of
dark
roast
coffeebitter
chocolate
and
earthmild
flavors
with
a
thin
feel
is
not
the
best
thing
in
the
world
i
was
expecting
better
from
a
pretty
good
brewery
but
this
just
okay
for
me
it
was
something
of
a
novelty
as
there
are
not
that
many
nitrocanned
beers
out
there
bit
canversely
i
am
a
hophead
so
something
like
this
is
really
not
my
cup
of
tea
not
bad
but
for
me
a
once
and
done
poured
from
a
14
9
oz
nitro
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
coffee
taste
is
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
smooth
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
not
overly
flavorful
for
a
stout
but
a
pretty
good
beer
nonetheless
but
this
is
good
and
i
can
definitely
see
buying
a
case
well
done
pours
a
pitch

with
creamy
nitro

is
of
roasted

cream
and
chocolate
taste
is
heavy
on
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
with
mellow
caramel
sweetness
around
the
edges
mouthfeel
is
smooth
dense
and
velvety
overall
easy
drinking
with
decent
presence
of
flavor
dark
brown
in
color
with
an
attractive
cascading
waterfall
effect
leading
to
a
permanent
slab
of
a
head
just
as
it
should
mild
nutty
and
toasted
malt
aromas
with
hints
of
sweet
bread
and
fudge
a
little
prune
and
tobacco
as
it
warms
coffee
bean
cocoa
and
black
malt
flavors
all
very
very
mellow
a
little
watery
even
though
there
is
an
expected
creaminess
at
the
same
time
all
in
all
it
does
come
across
as
thin
but
its
still
certainly
enjoyable
drinkable
to
the
max
too
a
soso
english
stout
what
the
nitro
promotes
in
the
feel
makes
flavor
sacrificial
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
dense
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
a
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
coffee
ground
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
powder
and
coffee
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
but
more
subtle
flavors
in
my
opinion
o
i
would
drink
it
but
i
prefer
my
stouts
to
be
a
little
more
rich
even
if
under
5
not
a
bad
start
for
someone
who
is
new
to
the
style
dark
enough
that
i
couldnt
see
through
it
with
minimal
head
for
a
stout
the
roasted
malt
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
flavours
came
as
little
surprise
after
a
strong
coffee
nose
i
thought
this
was
quite
well
balanced
with
a
decent
hoppy
edge
but
unfortunately
too
much
coffee
for
my
taste
the
taste
followed
the
smells
with
liquorice
added
for
good
measure
mellowed
as
it
warmed
a
bit
harsher
when
first
poured
but
it
turned
into
a
fine
beer
in
the
end
on
cask
at
whey
pat
st
andrews
dark
brownblack
with
a
little
lace
and
whispy
film
aroma
of
mocha
and
a
slight
roastiness
taste
has
a
good
roast
malt
presence
with
a
dry
bitterness
this
carries
on
to
the
finish
mostly
dry
bitterness
and
malt
not
much
complexity
and
the
mouthfeel
is
bitter
and
slightly
watery
its
on
the
light
end
in
terms
of
stout
body
easydrinking
though
and
good
and
dry
fairly
average
stout
gets
the
job
done
but
i
would
get
it
again
soon
a
pretty
basic
stout
in
most
departments
really
it
was
drinkable
but
nothing
stood
out
or
was
particularly
enjoyable
not
a
beer
ill
be
having
again
would
it
be
a
heresy
to
say
it
had
more
of
a
dunkel
feel
to
it
than
a
stout
s
lovely
a
tasty
stout
that
hits
the
spot
looks
the
part
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
showcase
plenty
of
roasted
malt
and
coffee
notes
the
body
could
be
a
shade
thicker
and
perhaps
slightly
less
carbonated
but
its
none
the
worse
for
that
goes
down
a
treat
worth
sampling
if
you
come
across
it
id
have
preferred
a
little
less
fizz
in
the
body
feel
but
many
would
argue
against
that
overall
a
fine
beer
by
a
brewery
that
blows
hot
and
cold

me

this

medium

can

the

the

up
a
bit
but
is
a
welcome
part
of
the
experience
loved
this
highly
drinkable
and
complex
enough
to
chase
down
again
my
slow
gentle
pour
resulted
in
only
some
tan
wisps
but
cest

color
was
a
deep
dark
brown
black
to
the
eye
but
with
brown
highlights
at
the
edges
nose
had
notes
of
dark
chocolate
fudge
licorice
and
dried
dark
fruit
it
is
a
promising
date
with
the
lass
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
she
has
aged
well
but
she
has
definitely
aged
the
taste
was
very
charcoal
smoky
up
front
with
dark
chocolate
underneath
on
the
tongue
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
charcoal
would
have
been
more
muted
in
her
youth
finish
was
smoky
and
charcoal
not
bad
but
perhaps
not
exactly
as
intended
it
might
be
worth
revisiting
this
beer
although
it
was
billed
as
bottle
conditioned
drinkability
mouthfeel
issues
aside
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
d
a
little
too
bitter
and
acidic
to
drink
more
than
one
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
english
stouts
ive
tried
drinkability
very
smooth
and
quite
easy
to
drink
a
great
example
of
a
british
stout
well
worth
the
price
aftermath
not
a
gentle
beer
the
charredroasty
flavors
are
strong
and
quite
assertive
the
bubbles
because
they
are
rather
strong
are
also
bit
offputting
though
after
letting
it
settle
in
the
glass
a
mellow
flavor
did
reveal
itself
rather
than
drink
this
alone
some
baked
beans
or
shepherds
pie
drinkability
this
to
me
is
a
just
above
average
english
stout
it
tastes
good
and
i
could
have
a
couple
but
could
just
as
easily
pass
overall
a
really
nice
stout
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
to
it
and
some
smoke
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavour
but
its
all
very
subtle
d
nice
beer
here
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
and
the
abv
makes
this
an
extremely
sessionable
beer
f
finishes
semi
bitter
with
that
nagging
weird
metallic
tangy
off
flavor
seeming
to
last
way
back
on
the
tongue
its
semi
dry
and
that
lingering
off
flavor
really
detracts
from
the
beer
a
slight
earthy
bitter
stout
flavor
also
sticks
around
for
a
bit
that
is
a
more
pleasant
its
also
pretty
thin
i
like
this
havent
had
many
english
stouts
but
this
is
nice
and
enjoyable
it
won
camras
champion
bottle
conditioned
beer
award
in
2008
i
can
clearly
see
why
pick
it
up
d
very
drinkable
fun
in
some
superficial
ways
but
in
the
end
not
that
satisfying
best
part
is
the
label
very
tasty
brew
from
a
category
that
is
sometimes
passed
over
for
the
aggressive
riss
out
there
very
easy
to
drink
and
true
to
the
style
d
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
nice
mild
sessionable
low
abv
stout
and
im
not
even
a
huge
fan
of
any
sort
of
stout
the
worst
part
of
the
experience
is
the
hellacious
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
thats
almost
impossible
to
shake
very
strange
and
very
offputting
the
taste
is
quite
good
once
you
get
by
the
really
pricklish
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
and
the
over
the
top
carbonation
with
this
one
the
beer
is
definitely
charred
a
bit
around
the
edges
it
has
a
molasses
and
caramel
flavor
and
is
predominately
semidark
chocolate
with
some
slight
bittering
notes
there
is
a
bit
of
creamy
smoothness
hidden
underneath
all
the
prickly
stuff
the
beer
isnt
particularly
watery
has
very
modest
abv
and
had
little
aftertaste
not
a
bad
find
this
one
has
some
of
the
burnt
smokey
and
roasted
characteristics
that
set
a
stout
stout
porter
aside
from
a
porter
well
rounded
and
solid

the

notes
medium

drinkable
a
nice

overall
nothing
stands
out
it
is
an
ok
beer
taste
is
decent
but
it
is
over
carbonated
and
even
with
that
the
aroma
is
lacking
a
bit
this
beer
is
a
little
above
average
i
was
close
to
awarding
a
4
for
flavor
its
a
little
bit
slick
but
the
carbonation
level
is
very
high
theres
definitely
more
carbonation
than
id
like
in
a
stout
drinkability
is
decent
but
probably
wouldnt
get
this
one
to
savor
ever
again
could
surely
be
an
ok
addition
to
a
night
of
heavy
imbibing

very
original
this
is
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
had
unexpectedly
smokey
with
a
new
set
of
flavors
for
the
style
that
is
a
beer
that
is
hard
to
interpret
and
that
is
why
you
see
a
higher
range
of
rating
deviation
o
nice
but
no
real
port
character
good
change
of
pace
worth
a
try
had
this
from
a
hand
pumped
cask
at
tap
and
table
in
emmaus
a
while
ago
the
beer
came
out
as
a
deep
brownish
black
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
on
top
the
head
narrowed
itself
down
to
just
a
thin
line
over
the
beer
the
smell
of
earth
and
roasted
barley
were
prominent
the
taste
was
a
little
less
intense
that
most
stouts
it
was
dry
and
roasted
a
little
watery
too
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
the
cask
killed
most
if
not
all
the
carbonation
here
overall
the
brew
was
decent
its
nothing
id
go
a
distance
for
to
have
again
not
the
best
english
stout
ive
had
indeed
far
from
the
greats
but
with
just
enough
interest
going
for
it
to
make
it
worthwhile
carbonation
is
waaay
too
high
well
an
average
stout
this
one
i
had
expected
some
more
sweet
port
notes
thick
midnight
black
with
an
abundant
crop
of
camelcolored
foam
weak
in
the
nose
with
only
basic
stout
aromas
of
coffee
chickory
coffee
and
roasted
nuts
not
bad
but
not
special
as
for
the
flavor
it
is
also
somewhat
disappointing
ive
had
stouts
not
brewed
with
port
that
have
more
of
a
port
flavor
not
to
mention
barleywines
there
is
a
trace
of
sweet
port
but
mostly
this
is
an
ordinary
but
good
stout
with
a
textbook
taste
of
cocoa
coffee
burnt
toast
and
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
properly
full
and
soft
feel
well
matched
to
the
flavor
and
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
lingering
burnt
nut
aftertaste
not
the
wonderful
digestif
id
hoped
for
but
still
a
perfectly
good
stout
even
if
it
is
rather
gimmicky
a
very
good
start
to
my
evening
i
hope
the
next
two
or
three
depending
on
my
mood
and
soberness
are
as
drinkable
as
this
this
beer
pours
a
nice
darkrubycola
colour
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
frothylong
staying
two
finger
head
with
heaps
of
lacing
very
nice
lookingthe
aroma
is
just
above
average
with
hints
of
blueberriesdark
malty
port
and
some
weak
coffeeit
has
an
average
mouthfeel
with
tastes
of
dark
roasted
malty
coated
hops
which
finishes
very
smooth
with
no
taste
of
port
at
all
in
fact
i
think
the
port
perfectly
balances
out
this
beer
to
give
it
a
very
smooth
finishquite
a
nice
beer
that
would
buy
again
worth
a
try
and
a
second
try
gets
too
acidic
after
a
while
and
is
too
flat
for
more
than
a
small
glass
pours
jet
black
with
a
large
tan
head
which
holds
retention
well
smells
of
roast
and
port
more
notes
of
the
latter
but
no
esters
has
a
good
roast
taste
with
high
bittering
which
is
a
nice
complement
to
the
sweet
winey
port
this
has
a
medium
full
body
but
finishes
dry
due
to
the
high
hopping
rates
which
is
a
tad
unexpected
overall
an
enjoyable
and
unique
beer
but
not
astounding
i
wish
more
of
these
would
cross
the
pond
a
subtle
stout
rich
but
also
smooth
at
the
same
time
the
malts
give
a
good
roasty
flavor

body
is
a
bit
too
thin
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
with
some
good
carbonation
i
guess
this
is
ok
but
not
something
i
would
necessarily
seek
again

its
just
not

the
depth
i
look
for
in
a

at
chaucers

in

a
deep
brown
pour
that
lets
in
some
light
is
topped
with
a
frothy
mocha
cap
with
nice
retention
and

the
aromas
here
are
dark
chocolate
black
coffee
some
dark
fruits
cherry
a
smidge
of
hops
but
no
port
to
speak
of
tastes
strongly
of
black
coffee
mixed
with
dark
chocolate
a
bit
lactic
some
slightly
fruity
components
which
may
be
from
the
port
bitter
towards
the
end
but
a
bit
thin
in
terms
of
a
stout
pretty
good
i
am
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
as
it
is
it
is
a
nice
english
stout
i
dont
detect
much
port
character
here
and
so
i
dont
really
understand
what
the
brewer
is
trying
to
accomplish
by
making
this
enriched
with
ruby
port
something
i
would
try
again
if
i
saw
it
though
have
an
ohanlons
goodwill
bitter
instead
i
would
not
bother
with
this
one
again
a
unusual
and
smooth
stout
and
probably
a
very
good
hangover
cure
but
tbh
an
unremarkable
example
of
the
beer
style
in
terms
of
taste
overall
an
ok
stout
nothing
special
but
reasonably
drinkable
worth
a
try
other
comments
this
is
a
very
dry
stout
so
its
definitely
best
with
some
pretzels
or
something
to
take
the
edge
of
the
roast
not
my
favorite
d
a
nice
beer
the
port
never
dominates
but
rather
adds
an
extra
fruity
complexity
the
only
thing
that
stops
it
rating
higher
in
drinkability
is
the
price
aus
8
99
the
soft
carbonation
suited
the
style
but
the
body
was
just
a
tiny
bit
on
the
watery
side
a
good
flavorful
sipper
that
id
definitely
have
again
i
think
my
hopes
were
a
little
too
high
for
this
one
it
isnt
bad
but
i
had
hoped
for
better
ps
yes
i
can
actually
spell
domestic
and
connoisseur
properly
ahhh
memories
md
refreshingly
light
on
the
mouthfeel
yet
almost
fullbodied
for
a
stout
this
is
a
successful
dark
ale
inbw
an
irish
dry
stout
and
an
english
stout
the
label
says
its
the
original
port
stout
enriched
with
rich
ruby
port
but
on
the
palate
the
ports
influence
is
kept
to
the
minimum
maybe
the
amount
of
port
added
is
not
so
considerable
i
remember
tasting
it
once
on
draught
at
the
white
horse
parsons
green
and
it
had
a
much
more
profound
vinous
flavour
imparted
by
the
port
added
to
it
and
ive
also
tried
a
brilliantly
imitated
version
by
the
marble
brewery
manchester
which
is
also
richer
in
its
portish
characters
so
at
best
id
guess
the
recipe
of
this
beer
might
have
been
changed
or
i
mustve
expected
too
much
from
the
name
that
said
this
is
a
very
good
quality
stout
all
the
same
recommended
i
dont
get
much
aroma
here
some
very
mild
roasted
barley
malt
is
all
deep
black
with
a
very
lively
tan
head
mildly
roasty
but
the
intensity
is
very
low
almost
no
flavor
here
just
a
sweetish
malt
mash
and
even
that
isnt
very
stout
like
very
dissapointed
with
this
i
bought
this
and
a
stout
called
kinmount
willie
at
the
same
time
i
figured
this
would
shine
and
the
willie
would
be
mediocre
but
it
was
the
exact
opposite
d
i
left
the
second
half
in
the
fridge
for
a
day
but
still
couldnt
finish
it
taste
is
somewhat
like
a
typical
stout
roasted
chocolate
malts
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
but
with
a
bitter
twist
on
it
i
can
certainly
taste
an
additional
something
in
this
likely
the
port
never
having
had
port
i
can
only
assume
certainly
an
interesting
flavour
and
it
makes
for
a
very
complex
stout
that
is
worth
repeating
however
i
find
this
quite
rich
and
generally
drink
this
as
a
finishing
beer
therefore
i
find
its
drinkability
somewhat
limited
due
to
its
dessertlike
qualities
thanks
bieristgut
for

brown

aroma
wine
barley
liquorice
smokey
chocolate
caramel
hops
and
hints
of

flavor
bitter
smoke
wine
like
some
sourness
and
a
dry
finish
i
have
had
better
the
beer
poured
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
persistent
3
finger
head
aroma
was
chocolate
roasted
and
coffee
flavor
that
is
slightly
sour
with
good
hops
then
coffee
and
a
slight
nutty
ruby
port
flavor
as
it
warmed
the
finish
is
dry
expresso
the
body
is
pretty
thin
quite
smooth
and
good
balance
of
flavours
leaves
a
chocolate
aftertaste
for
me
certainly
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
this
stout
poured
an
almost
opaque
dark
coffee
brown
color
with
thin
brown
foam
the
smell
was
roasted
slightly
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
licorice
the
taste
was
roasted
malt
with
a
mild
fruitiness
and
some
bitter
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
low
carbonation
and
it
wad
dry
throughout
the
roasted
malt
and
hoppy
flavor
lingered
this
was
a
good
stout
this
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
ruby
hue
and
a
thick
light
tan
head
both
the
head
and
the
lacing
are
foamy
and
lasting
slightly
vinous
aroma
with
roasted
malt
and
coffee
as
well
the
body
is
not
as
rich
as
a
lot
of
stouts
and
the
taste
leans
toward
a
bitter
coffee
along
with
cocoachocolate
and
malt
the
port
wine
that
is
added
does
not
really
enhance
the
flavor
much
but
it
is
more
present
in
the
aftertaste
i
like
what
this
stout
is
hinting
at
especially
considering
port
wines
are
among
my
favorite
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
and
bitter
and
lingers
with
the
coffee
and
port
flavors
overall
this
is
pretty
good
deep
brown
to
black
in
colour
roasty
malt
nose
with
a
faint
hint
of
port
very
charry
ash
tray
like
roasted
malt
flavour
almost
a
bit
too
charry
but
in
general
pretty
tasty
and
and
quite
a
decent
bitter
finish
thickish
and
complex
not
too
bad
in
the
end
o
it
is
a
decent
beer
i
really
didnt
detect
much
of
the
port
but
it
was
interesting
to
try
it
overall
a
sipper
where
the
port
comes
through
big
this
is
about
as
different
a
stout
as
i
have
had
in
a
while
you
must
like
port
to
enjoy
this
one
and
i
do
however
the
taste
is
a
bit
too
strong
and
different
for
me
so
this
is
most
likely
a
one
and
done

it
poured
into
my
tasting
glass
nice
and
dark
brown
with
hints

highlights
it
has
some
head
and

the
smell
was

with
some
notes

fruit
and
the
bitterness
of
dark
chocolate
i
drank
it
and
it
was
very
flavorfull
and
had
a
unique
taste
due
to
its
port
wine
attribute
d
this
beer
was
a
one
and
done
actually
i
dont
think
i
finished
the
very
end
of
this
one
i
didnt
expect
a
whole
lot
with
this
one
and
it
didnt
surprise
me
might
drink
again
if
someone
buys

dont

and
review
notes
an
interesting
twist
on
stouts
good
stuff
d
good
beer
very
interesting
combo
here
recommend
giving
it
a
try
the
concept
interested
me
a
stout
enriched
with
port
wine
pours
almost
black
with
a
generous
amber
head
and
fruity
hopspicy
nose
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
hits
you
before
the
tastetoo
much
carbonation
it
takes
a
while
to
settle
down
but
when
it
does
what
emerges
is
an
especially
dry
stout
flavor
with
winy
portlike
topnotes
all
in
all
a
disappointment
though
i
would
like
to
try
another
one
and
compare
it
with
other
ohanlon
offerings
if
i
can
find
them
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
to
enjoy
a
nice
dry
english
stout
worth
a
try
this
is
an
english
ale
so
the
flavors
tend
to
be
more
on
the
mild
side
hats
off
to
ohanlons
for
crafting
this
beer
i
just
wish
they
would
have
turned
it
up
a
bit
louder
anyway
this
is
not
an
especially
interesting
beer
and
certainly
does
not
live
up
to
its
promise
decently
drinkable
and
very
light
dont
think
ill
buy
this
again
theres
too
many
better
beers
out
there
drain
pour
for
me
i
tried
to
finish
it
and
i
just
couldnt
d
i
bought
this
beer
on
the
assumption
that
it
would
create
an
interesting
marriage
between
beer
and
port
wine
but
it
turned
out
just
to
be
a
mediocre
stout
i
would
say
to
the
creators
that
they
should
use
more
port
try
a
different
blend
i
assumed
this
beer
would
be
around
89
before
i
looked
at
the
bottle
but
at
4
5
the
port
would
have
to
be
very
understated
as
port
is
like
1719
alcohol
fortified
with
brandy
ill
finish
the
bottle
for
sure
but
i
wont
buy
again
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
bad
as
a
stout
but
more
port
character
would
have
been
welcomed
as
would
a
touch
more
smokiness
to
give
it
more
of
an
english
stout
character
a
nice
appearance
body
and
smoothness
but
more
richness
in
aroma
and
taste
with
more
port
character
would
bring
this
to
a
higher
more
unique
level
pours
a
thick
brown
opaque
except
for
the
edges
with
a
cream
head
that
falls
to
18
smell
is
a
nice
mink
chocolate
with
just
a
tiny
hint
of
cherries
taste
is
a
very
smooth
restrained
espressolike
bitterness
with
very
little
else
not
sure
where
the
port
went
but
this
is
a
nice
calm
enjoyable
stout
not
one
id
wrestle
an
alligator
for
but
certainly
more
flavorful
than
many
other
lowalcohol
stouts
probably
wonderful
with
oysters
and
lighter
desserts
i
didnt
expect
great
things
out
of
the
original
ruby
stout
but
i
sure
as
hell
expected
more
than
this
the
idea
of
adding
port
to
stout
is
appealing
because
if
done
right
the
resulting
beer
could
be
both
interesting
and
good
if
done
wrong
as
here
the
result
is
a
chore
to
finish
if
you
want
to
see
this
brewery
at
their
best
go
with
royal
oak
pale
ale
only
disappointment
for
me
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
leads
to
disappointment
in
the
taste
and
aftertaste
pours
black
with
a
tenacious
soft
light
brown
head
and
the
faintest
of
deep
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
direct
light
the
nose
is
subdued
some
roasted
malts
bakers
chocolate
burnt
caramel
and
just
a
tinge
of
fruits
the
ruby
port
added
to
this
beer
is
not
forward
in
the
nose
on
the
palate
the
key
word
for
this
beer
is
smooth
mildly
bitter
malts
first
off
then
the
port
character
comes
through
as
cherry
flavors
show
up
for
the
midpalate
the
end
comes
with
mild
bitter
chocolate
and
an
increasingly
dry
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
lightly
carbonated
although
this
beer
has
a
beautiful
head
and
highly
smooth
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
seamless
and
deep
with
the
perfect
amount
of
fruit
notes
blended
in
this
is
a
great
example
of
what
wonderful
flavors
can
be
achieved
at
a
relatively
low
abv
d
this
is
a
mild
and
quite
drinkable
english
brew
nothing
too
special
or
impressive
about
it
simple
yet
different
and
something
i
may
venture
to
try
again
when
i
came
across
this
beer
at
the
store
it
caught
my
attention
and
peaked
my
interest
combining
port
wine
with
stout
like
a
cross
between
a
barley
wine
and
a
stout
they
are
two
of
my
favorites
when
i
poured
the
beer
it
was
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
high
frothy
head
it
settled
to
the
creamy
head
seen
on
many
stouts
upon
taking
a
whif
i
immediately
noticed
the
fruity
wine
in
it
with
some
deep
malty
aromas
in
the
background
the
taste
was
different
good
but
not
robust
and
stouty
enough
there
was
the
hint
of
a
barley
wine
taste
at
the
beginning
with
a
clean
dark
roasted
malt
finish
carbonation
was
a
bit
high
at
first
taste
but
flatten
out
towards
the
bottom
overall
i
liked
this
beer
something
different
smooth
drinking
and
would
have
it
again
but
it
was
a
little
weak
for
a
stout
and
could
use
a
little
more
kick
bittersweet
cocoa
nibs
roasted
black
malts
some
plum
or
dark
fruit
character
creamy
mouthfeel
at
first
until
the
carbonation
wanes
last
third
of
the
bottle
felt
a
little
flat
not
too
robust
more
in
english
porter
territiory
to
me
easy
to
put
down
the
pint
perhaps
a
little
too
pricey
to
session
ok
easy
to
drink
and
rather
sessionable
but
nothing
i
would
hurry
back
for
drinkability
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
good
stout
but
i
dont
know
if
im
going
to
come
back
to
this
one
that
often
ive
been
enjoying
the
stout
and
ruby
port
mix
a
k
a
velvet
pussy
for
some
time
now
and
imo
a
quality
12oz
stout
with
a
12oz
pour
of
quality
port
works
better
than
ohanlons
concoction
s
first
sip
reveals
average
body
and
very
fine
carbonation
flavor
is
kind
of
mild
with
some
roast
malt
and
again
texture
is
silky
smooth
and
an
easy
drinker
not
the
most
interesting
but
very
well
made
and
quite
nice
md
thin
and
watery
like
an
irish
stout
like
guiness
this
really
didnt
do
anything
for
me
this
review
may
seem
thin
but
there
wasnt
that
much
flavor
to
write
about
what
was
there
was
good
just
wasnt
enough
clear
chestnut
brown
topped
by
a
big
chunky
tan
head
the
soap
bubble
foam
left
clumpy
lacing
behind
as
it
receded
smells
of
roasted
malt
licorice
fruity
and
winey
with
a
light
hop
component
port
wine
is
all
over
the
place
in
the
flavour
pretty
much
drowning
everything
else
out
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
peeks
through
but
thats
it
really
fruity
and
sweet
the
bodys
on
the
thin
side
carbonation
is
initially
quite
high
resulting
in
a
substantial
cap
of
foam
but
falls
flat
quite
quickly
overall
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
d
i
suppose
the
lighter
body
helps
drinkability
but
after
the
smell
and
appearance
it
was
somewhat
of
a
letdown
give
it
a
try
if
you
like
a
lighter
bodied
stout
ohanlons
the
original
ruby
stout
pours
an
almost
black
color
with
a
little
ruby
around
the
edges
it
has
a
fluffy
tan
head
and
came
from
a
brown
16
9
ounce
bottle
it
is
bottle
conditioned
i
got
a
whiff
of
ruby
port
when
i
opened
the
bottle
but
the
beer
itself
doesnt
have
much
aroma
i
can
taste
the
ruby
port
immediately
in
the
flavor
it
is
fairly
mild
though
that
being
said
i
dont
really
taste
much
else
maybe
some
roasted
malts
lingering
in
the
background
really
disappointing
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
your
money
is
better
spent
elsewhere
the
beer
pours
from
500ml
brown
body
a
soot
black
with
a
tinge
of
ruby
the
head
forms
a
light
chocolate
brown
semicreamy
crown
to
top
the
great
body
as
it
vanishes
the
resultant
lace
forms
a
thick
obscuring
skirt
to
surround
the
glass
nose
has
a
bittersweet
chocolate
aroma
back
up
by
the
sweet
port
fresh
and
clean
start
is
sweet
with
a
delightful
grain
presence
and
the
top
is
rich
and
full
to
the
palate
finish
has
a
perfect
acidity
the
hops
supported
by
the
port
which
gives
you
a
nice
warming
sensation
dry
and
lingering
aftertaste
after
sampling
i
went
out
and
got
a
couple
more
of
this
most
delightful
bottle
conditioned
beer
finish
is
long
bitter
and
tannic
with
a
copperlike
aftertaste
cheers
d
the
malt
was
pleasant
and
it
tasted
like
a
nice
porter
but
the
port
notes
were
a
little
unpleasant
i
really
love
a
good
port
and
i
really
like
oak
in
many
beers
this
port
flavor
tasted
cheap
and
a
bit
to
red
wine
like
with
a
big
smoke
and
oak
finish
i
will
have
to
hunt
this
down
and
try
if
fresh
but
i
didnt
feel
like
it
had
been
oxidized
this
is
really
a
good
beer
its
appearance
and
smell
just
had
me
expecting
something
way
different
from
what
i
got
this
is
an
interesting
stout
worth
a
try
but
it
has
some
serious
mouthfeel
issues
in
my
book
and
if
youre
going
to
drop
4
bucks
on
a
stout
you
can
really
do
better
cheers
drinkability
good
interesting
but
probably
not
one
i
would
think
to
retrun
to
thanks
to
lucksevens82
for
this
one
overall
id
say
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
to
be
had
once
in
a
blue
moon
perhaps
something
as
a
divergence
from
ones
normal
array
of
brews
or
simply
as
a
treat
this
may
be
the
desert
wine
of
beers
only
desert
wines
suck
and
this
is
good
best
before
date
of

pretty
good
for
colorado
most
imports
seem
to
be
way
past
their
bbds
that
ive
come
across
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
mouthfeel
could
benefit
from
better
structure
its
decent
but
not
all
that
enjoyable
prickly
on
the
tongue
but
sharp
as
well
for
a
stout
in
this
range
i
would
choose
something
with
more
eloquence
in
terms
of
overall
drinkability
next
time
d
an
excellent
craft
brew
with
a
touch
of
pinache
something
different
that
isnt
too
different
to
be
enjoyed
on
a
regular
basis
a
simple
choice
for
a
cool
relaxing
evening
uf
the
beer
poured
a
beautiful
dark
brown
capped
by
a
fine
tan
head
the
aroma
was
full
of
dark
fruits
then
the
taste
sharp
malt
with
undertones
of
cherry
the
feel
was
incredibly
soft
and
very
dry
this
was
a
fine
experience
the
bottle
sold
it
as
an
afterdinner
drink
so
i
put
it
to
the
test
this
was
a
prefect
beer
to
end
a
great
evening
with
the
port
has
softened
the
stout
and
the
result
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
tasty
drinkable
stout
that
wont
scare
anyone
off
probably
not
the
beer
for
those
who
like
bitter
and
burnt
stouts
me
i
prefer
stoutflavored
stouts
but
this
was
quite
nice
and
id
recommend
it
for
special
occasions
or
sharing
with
friends
dark

and
a

mouthfeel
is
lightish
medium
carbonation
is
bright
apparent
and
speckly
all
the
way
through
to
the
close

is
a
unique
combination
of
very
noticeable
fruit
again
the
apple
and
a
counterpoint
of
bitter
roasted
malt
with
a
coffee
quality
aftertaste
is
diminished
in
the
main
structural
qualities
but
the
port
seems
pretty
evident
late
similar
to
sweet
fermented
strawberries
a
little
different
and
a
fun
beer
to
give
a
whirl
drink
drinkability

the
carbonation
here
is
so
intense
that
you
wouldnt
want
to
try
and
session
this
english
stout
but
its
a
good
drinker
regardless
enriched
with
ruby
port
wine
i
find
that
interesting
the
color
is
black
head
is
thick
creamy
and
light
brown
head
size
is
medium
with
a
longlife
aroma
is
of
dark
malts
and
what
i
guess
is
port
wine
i
know
next
to
nothing
about
wine
the
taste
is
of
roasted
chocolate
with
a
notably
sweet
finish
a
coffee
taste
is
in
the
mix
here
this
is
a
complex
stout
this
is
very
drinkable
stuff
i
recommend
checking
it
out
pours
well
a
nice
port
color
brown
with
alot
of
ruby
highlights
thru
out
with
creamy
head
that
sticks
nicely
to
the
glassinteresting
aromas
charred
fruit
and
molasses
with
an
odd
almost
olive
like
aroma
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
but
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
some
unsweetened
chocolate
and
charred
fruit
i
pick
up
the
most
in
flavor
along
with
a
little
of
the
odd
oliveness
i
wish
i
could
pin
that
down
but
pretty
dry
for
having
port
added
to
it
a
solid
stout
i
dont
pick
up
much
port
but
a
quaffer
for
the
style
definitely
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
stout
the
addition
of
port
wine
imparts
a
smoothness
that
aids
drinkability
and
rounds
off
any
hint
of
sharp
burnt
dark
maltiness
a
bit
overpriced
at
3
99
for
a
16
9
oz
bottle
but
worth
a
try
and
another
solid
offering
from
ohanlons
this
is
the
first
brew
that
i
have
gotten
from
ohanlons
have
a
couple
thas
sitting
around
but
have
not
tried
them
yet
it
pours
to
a
brown
color
with
a
burgundy
tint
to
it
and
has
a
very
foamy
head
that
breaks
down
slowly
leaving
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
seems
to
be
somewhat
week
but
what
i
am
able
to
pick
up
seems
pleasant
roasted
malt
tones
with
a
obvious
hint
of
port
that
leaves
thoughts
of
fruit
the
taste
was
not
overly
that
inspiring
seems
somewhat
week
but
you
are
able
to
notice
the
roasted
flavors
wine
type
flavor
and
dark
type
fruit
this
brew
finishes
dry
with
a
cocoa
essence
this
brew
is
ok
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
it
was
worth
the
try
not
sure
i
would
get
this
one
again
though
pours
a
deep
ruby
brown
color
with
a
volumnous
tan
colored
head
small
flakes
in
suspension
left
over
from
bottle
conditioning
roasted
malts
and
light
essence
of
woody
port
wine
with
a
touch
of
fruitiness
round
out
the
nose
port
wine
infusion
is
sharp
in
the
taste
with
a
nice
malty
backbone
beneath
light
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
in
the
malt
hopping
level
is
low
but
acceptable
because
the
port
provides
a
nice
twang
that
the
hops
would
otherwise
give
a
rather
unique
beer
thats
low
in
alcohol
and
huge
in
flavor
very
enjoyable
this
one
was
slightly
past
its
best
by
date
pours
a
dark
color
with
red
hues
around
the
edges
and
a
tall
head
that
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
chocolate
some
earthy
hops
and
a
sort
of
fruit
that
could
have
been
from
the
port
the
main
part
of
the
flavor
is
chocolate
but
it
has
an
underlying
fruit
that
gives
it
a
lot
of
character
very
nice
beer
the
body
is
full
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
this
beer
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
2
fingers
of
tan
head
that
fall
to
about
half
a
finger
over
the
beer
there
is
a
lot
of
stickey
lace
as
well
the
nose
has
a
good
bit
of
chocolate
in
there
along
with
just
hints
of
sweet
fruits
the
flavor
is
full
of
chocolate
with
some
really
nice
roasted
tones
on
the
finish
the
finish
is
also
very
dry
and
crisp
nice
beer
here
the
feel
is
moderate
to
slightly
thick
with
the
dry
finish
as
i
said
before
drinkability
is
good
on
this
one
as
well
i
will
have
no
problem
finishing
this
one

i
couldnt
identify
the

i
did

with
a
mahogany

along
the
bottom
of
the
glass
massive
spongy
beige
head
that
leaves
thick
rings
of
lacing
in
its
wake
upon
settling
there
is
still
an
impressive
cap
on
the

nice

the
aroma
contains
buried
roasted
malts
amongst
more
elevated
characteristics
of
sweet
cherry
fruit
and
port
the
core
of
the
flavour
is
a
dry
irish
stout
permeated
by
a
welcome
cherrygrape
sweetness
in
the
middle
along
with
a
vinuous
port
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
drying
aftertaste
of
roasted
malt
that
follows
the
light
acidic
port
finish
a
successful
experiment
on
the
part
of
ohanlons
definitely
an
interesting
combination
not
my
idea
of
a
session
stout
but
id
definitely
buy
more
of
it
dark
brown
with
a
beige
head
huge
smooth
carbonation
that
lasts
and
laces
my
glass
with
some
nice
tan
foam
the
aromas
are
of
beamish
and
port
really
thats
what
i
get
from
this
brew
the
port
is
heavy
in
the
aroma
making
this
brew
smell
fruity
boozy
and
nice
the
taste
is
that
of
a
good
dry
stout
it
is
roasty
up
front
and
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
with
a
lovely
port
flavor
in
the
middle
as
well
the
port
flavor
really
make
this
stout
stand
out
against
other
dry
stouts
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
the
drinkability
is
good
a
nice
one
an
interesting
experiment
roasted
malt
mixed
with
port
sweetness
and
im
enjoying
it
in
small
doses
id
probably
give
this
one
a
try
again
in
the
future

can

the

in
your

overall
a
decent
beerbet
it
would
be
good
on
draft
worth
trying
to
see
how
the
port
comes
thru
might
be
a
neat
idea
for
homebrewing
the
head
is
still
present
and
so
smooth
as
it
hits
your
mouth
then
the
chocolate
richness
of
the
stout
itself
makes
its
way
in
and
you
can
focus
on
nothing
else
the
port
is
masked
but
what
is
present
is
excellent
this
pours
out
black
with
some
nice
ruby
tint
on
the
edges
crazy
big
head
looks
pretty
nice
the
aroma
is
pretty
typical
stout
smells
roasty
soem
coffee
etc
didnt
really
pick
up
on
any
port
though
in
the
mouth
it
was
a
little
thin
not
bad
but
didnt
seem
hefty
enough
the
flavor
was
decent
stout
roasty
solid
still
no
evidence
of
wine
but
thats
probly
for
the
better
in
my
case
its
a
decent
drink
nothing
ill
crave
again
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
less
coasting
that
id
like
for
a
stout
likely
due
to
its
low
abv
while
drinkability
was
quite
good
no
problem
drinking
this
one
drinkability
not
a
session
beer
but
doesnt
make
any
claims
to
be
so
either
this
bottleconditioned
stout
pours
the
expected
opaqueblack
body
with
glints
of
mahogany
at
the
base
of
the
glass
and
ruby
highlights
along
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
even
carefully
poured
the
head
rises
up
causing
you
to
pause
a
moment
but
thats
ok
as
it
needs
to
sit
and
warm
a
little
anyway
and
in
that
time
the
frothy
light
tan
head
will
settle
into
a
creamy
meranguelike
cap
that
adds
even
more
to
its
appearance
the
retention
is
astounding
and
it
initially
leaves
wide
sheets
of
creamy
froth
about
the
glass
the
addition
of
a
small
amount
of
port
is
obvious
in
the
nose
with
a
combination
of
fruit
and
wine
thats
balanced
by
a
dull
roastiness
similar
to
that
of
spent
espresso
grounds
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
its
fine
natural
carbonation
delicately
caresses
the
tongue
before
leaving
it
smooth
and
creamy
across
the
palate
the
flavor
is
rich
with
wine
and
ripe
dark
fruit
plum
black
cherry
black
grape
up
front
followed
by
dark
bread
molasses
and
a
whisp
of
cocoa
across
the
middle
it
finishes
dry
and
roasty
with
a
passing
note
of
nutty
caramelish
malt
and
a
lingering
winey
note
that
fades
as
its
bold
bitterness
rises
its
quite
interesting
and
enjoyable
when
enjoyed
slowly
at
cellar
temperatures
but
as
the
label
suggests
in
its
reference
to
its
being
based
on
a
corpsereviver
hair
of
the
dog
it
makes
a
better
first
beer
of
the
morning
or
night
than
it
does
a
session
beer
this
is
opaque
black
with
a
light
tan
head
it
gives
rise
to
a
roasted
malt
aroma
with
a
slight
fruitiness
the
smooth
body
has
a
huge
roasted
malt
character
that
finishes
with
a
winey
tinge
and
slight
vanilla
i
tasted
some
of
the
port
influence
in
the
finish
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
this
is
a
great
dry
stout
with
a
different
spin
to
it
not
a
bad
stoud
just
not
sure
how
much
i
like
wine
with
my
beer
drinkability
well
its
low
octane
enough
and
certainly
tasty
but
i
would
rather
have
a
little
heavier
beverage
in
the
stout
class
odd
i
would
drink
more
of
a
heavier
drink
actually
yes
im
a
glutton
that
way
i
wont
ding
it
excessively
though
this
is
an
allaround
tasty
and
somewhat
unique
beer
i
may
have
it
again
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
i
dont
see
any
ruby
color
here
but
the
appearance
is
still
good
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
good
malt
character
there
are
crystal
roasted
and
black
malts
here
the
taste
is
good
it
is
rich
with
roasted
malts
it
has
a
dry
finish
but
satisfies
it
says
its
enriched
with
ruby
port
wine
but
i
cant
make
out
the
distinction
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
a
little
too
much
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
stout
it
drinks
well
and
has
good
dark
roasted
flavor
dark
brown
body
isnt
quite
black
sandy
head
lingers
for
a
while
but
eventually
fade
completely
sweet
chocolate
covered
cherry
aroma
but
faint
the
flavor
is
dry
up
front
a
little
roast
a
little
wood
in
the
end
theres
this
little
bubble
of
grapes
its
fleeting
and
not
strong
but
there
and
it
adds
a
little
interest
to
what
would
otherwise
be
a
boring
stout
there
cant
be
a
lot
of
port
in
here
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
airy
pours
a
ruby
color
with
a
moderate
sized
head
the
smell
is
very
roasty
and
maybe
some
alcohol
sweetness
the
first
flavor
is
a
chocolatecoffee
mixture
then
that
leaves
and
raisins
become
present
slight
underlying
bitterness
and
and
base
roasted
barley
taste
alcohol
is
present
and
actually
does
bring
a
portlike
flavor
to
the
end
of
the
beer
the
flavor
are
smooth
but
nothing
really
stands
out
to
make
this
a
great
beer
just
a
solid
beer
with
a
slightly
unique
flavor
to
it
pours
a
reddish
brown
with
a
long
lasting
tan
heada
semi
sweet
stout
with
a
little
bit
of
roasted
malt
bite
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
that
blew
me
away
but
there
is
nothing
bad
that
i
can
say
about
it
good
price
good
beer
id
recommend
to
anybody
who
likes

i
sampled
this
beer
about
2
days
after
its
bestbuy
date
but
after
about
a
minute
or
so
it
deflated
like
a
soufflé
when
the
oven
door
is
opened
soft
toasty
nose
mingled
with
rich
milk
chocolate
tasted
like
a
pretty
standard
stout
of
porter
with
plenty
of
roastiness
and
mellow
charcoal
no

flavors
are

beautiful

additional
will
look
for
this
one
again
overall
a
pretty
damn
good
stout
with
great
feel
and
certainly
a
mysterious
quality
as
advertised
its
a
bit
of
a
strange
brew
with
black
licorice
orchard
fruits
and
a
toffee
base
somehow
mixed
together
but
yet
worthy
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
wychwood
final
grade

a
b
wychwoods
black
wych
is
a
proper
englishstyle
dark
ale
a
bold
malt
bill
that
takes
centre
stage
but
is
kept
in
check
by
a
combination
of
roasted
notes
and
the
leafy
english
hop
bitterness
combine
that
with
an
enjoyable
mouthfeel
and
relatively
low
abv
and
youve
got
the
recipe
for
one
highly
serviceable
session
porter
this
is
not
an
especially
remarkable
beer
but
i
have
no
major
objections
and
its
definitely
one
of
the
better
products
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
over
the
years
overall
a
great
beer
from
an
outstanding
brewery
definitely
worth
a
try
at
least
once
fantastic
color
is
enough
to
make
it
notable
current
bottle
and
official
website
describe
this
one
as
a
robust
porter
not
bad
though
the
roasty
nearly
acrid
quality
dominates
without
much
else
to
round
out
the
flavor
the
best
by
date
on
this
bottle
is
august
2009
one
and
a
half
years
ago
but
seems
like
it
held
up
well
besides
a
slight
earthy
funk
on
the
nose
the
key
characteristics
of
this
stout
that
attracted
me
are
the
pleasantly
concocted
roasted
malt
flavors
along
with
the
light
lactic
notes
as
well
as
the
creamy
smooth
texture
not
bad
not
great
but
definitely
refreshing
and
sessionable
overall
this
is
a
solid
stout
but
not
exactly
a
memorable
one
its
well
made
but
doesnt
really
stand
out
in
any
dimension
unfortunately
all
in
all
a
very
nice
stout
nice
complexity
d
this
is
an
easy
stout
to
drink
of
course
this
would
be
great
with
a
beef
stew
or
bbqd
steak
with
a
rich
sauce
i
like
this
beer
and
think
its
a
great
session
beer
for
the
pub
with
friends
this
stout
is
different
from
the
norm
somewhat
and
i
recommend
for
those
who
want
something
unique
in
this
style
overall
well
nice
to
try
once
not
my
favorite
beer
of
this
style
at
all
final
thoughts
i
dunno
i
think
the
marketing
might
have
swayed
my
review
a
bit
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
diversity
maybe
some
sweetness
or
odd
hopping
or
welcome
bizarreness
what
i
found
was
a
mild
stout
which
certainly
beat
the
curve
but
i
wouldnt
call
remarkable
i
think
nitro
would
have
really
helped
this
out
out
i
wouldnt
consider
the
beer
to
be
spell
binding
bear
in
mind
that
this
style
of
stout
rarely
is
those
stout
lovers
with
insatiable
appetites
and
the
indulgent
sweettooth
might
find
themselves
left
with
much
to
be
desired
but
this
should
be
a
well
considered
option
for
those
who
enjoy
a
mild
mannered
easily
quaffed
pint
of
stout
it
didnt
put
any
spells
on
me
but
id
still
say
its
worth
a
look
if
youre
one
to
dabble
in
the
black
arts
a
solid
stout
one
ill
certainly
pick
up
again
go
for
this
one
if
you
like
your
stouts
dryyyy
i
had
to
try
this
one
for
the
label
alone
looked
much
better
then
it
was
oh
well
still
worth
trying
im
a
stout
fan
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
i
stocked
up
on
these
while
there
here
and
shall
be
enjoying
them
though
the
colder
months
an
excellent
session
beer
for
sure
a
decently
tasty
if
not
spellbinding
oldworld
stout
when
it
comes
to
beer
wychwood
seem
to
excel
at
mediocrity
none
of
their
beers
that
i
have
tried
are
exactly
horrible
but
none
are
particularly
great
they
seem
to
get
on
shelves
and
in
fridges
based
on
the
bottles
names
and
artwork
not
based
on
the
beer
not
bad
ill
buy
again
for
sure
but
prefer
something
like
the
propeller
porter
in
this
class
of
beer
edit
i
may
have
spoken
too
soon
a
bit
of
warmth
has
a
major
impact
on
this
beer
bitterness
settles
down
quite
a
bit
and
helps
the
flavour
come
through
points
added
to
taste
found
it
quite
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
balance
was
very
good
not
complex
but
a
stright
up
good
session
stout
an
extremely
drinkable
mild
english
stout
smooth
and
inoffensive
with
just
enough
character
to
keep
you
interested
i
do
like
a
nice
drinkable
english
stout
and
this
is
a
good
example
weakly
sour
with
a
really
annoyingly
thin
feel
really
doesnt
grip
me
with
flavour
or
body
look
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
disappoints
me
with
its
lack
of
flavour
its
reasonably
drinkable
but
just
falls
flat
d
this
is
a
nice
stout
but
not
the
best
ill
probably
buy
this
one
again
the
body
was
a
bit
disappointing
too
weak
bodied
for
a
stout
drinkable
and
may
be
a
great
alternative
for
guinness
fans
in
the
hot
summer
months
when
it
would
be
slightly
more
refreshing
drinkability
i
really
like
stouts
this
is
definitely
not
the
most
interesting
or
complex
stout
out
there
but
with
5
abv
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
it
goes
down
really
easy
so
drinkability
is
high
note
apparently
we
used
to
be
able
to
get
this
in
ontario
we
can
still
get
hobgoblin
i
think
but
i
hear
the
lcbo
has
discontinued
this
brew
what
a
shame
ill
keep
my
fingers
crossed
and
have
a
look
around
when
im
back
home
a
very
good
english
stout
black
wych
described
on
the
label
as
a
spell
binding
stout
i
am
a
big
fan
of
stouts
having
been
brought
up
by
my
eldest
brother
to
think
of
guinness
as
the
height
of
manly
drinking
thus
it
was
no
surprise
that
my
first
ever
legal
beer
was
a
guinness
these
days
i
steer
clear
of
the
liffey
water
say
it
quietly
but
i
prefer
beamish
of
the
mass
produced
irish
stouts
although
i
am
yet
to
try
the
ohara
stout
but
it
is
high
on
my
list
for
stuff
to
try
for
my
birthday
weekend
in
ireland
but
i
digress
back
to
the
idyllic
english
countryside
black
wych
pours
dark
very
dark
so
dark
it
is
practically
opaque
i
even
put
it
right
up
next
to
a
light
and
couldnt
see
through
it
the
head
was
the
same
colour
as
comes
on
an
espresso
in
an
italian
café
and
boy
is
this
stuff
thick
the
coffee
theme
continues
in
the
nose
lots
and
lots
of
roasted
coffee
beans
with
a
subtle
burnt
chocolate
undertone
which
almost
smothers
a
burnt
caramel
twist
i
was
excited
about
this
one
and
the
first
mouthful
didnt
let
me
down
with
the
espresso
theme
of
roasted
bitterness
bursting
on
to
my
tongue
however
it
wasnt
the
velvety
smooth
stout
that
the
label
promised
it
is
very
dry
perhaps
some
oats
would
have
smoothed
it
out
not
that
it
was
bad
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
this
was
a
very
fine
pint
one
that
would
go
well
with
bowls
of
stew
and
open
fires
in
the
middle
of
winter
a
thick
mouthfeel
and
a
nice
drinkable
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
better
than
hobgoblin
wychwoods
best
beer
ive
had
so
far
i
liked
it
however
the
weak
mouthfeel
didnt
detract
from
the
overal
taste
or
enjoyment
if
the
head
had
stayed
and
there
was
more
meat
in
the
body
then
this
would
have
been
a
very
very
good
beer
this
beer
poured
an
almost
black
reddish
amber
color
and
formed
a
medium
tan
foamy
head
that
left
circular
lace
as
it
subsided
some
carbonization
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
and
some
anise
is
present
the
flavor
was
of
malt
and
burnt
coffee
with
some
toffee
present
the
body
is
medium
light
and
has
a
slightly
burnt
finish
this
would
make
a
good
session
beeer
drinkability
good
traditional
strong
coffee
beer
in
the
style
english
stout
a
solid
nicely
balanced
tasty
english
stout
that
is
drinkable
even
sessionable
drinkability
wychwood
seem
to
have
aimed
for
a
stout
you
can
enjoy
for
a
good
session
without
wrecking
your
palate
and
i
reckon
they
hit
that
target
but
its
a
bit
you
know
milquetoast
i
didnt
finish
the
bottle
with
the
sense
of
discovery
and
desire
stock
the
press
with
it
that
i
got
from
say
fullers
london
porter
and
im
not
sure
ill
buy
some
more
note
the
bottle
was
a
brown
glass
bottle
much
preferred
to
the
clear
glass
one
this
is
a
nearly
black
beer
thick
and
almost
solid
in
color
the
head
begins
very
dense
and
tan
but
falls
quickly
into
a
thin
and
wispy
sheet
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
smells
of
slightly
burnt
and
heavily
roasted
barley
are
straightforward
and
wonderful
theres
a
bit
of
fruit
and
a
little
coffee
and
chocolate
some
pepper
and
a
little
spice
hang
in
the
distance
of
the
aroma
not
bad
at
all
its
a
fairly
dry
beer
with
a
little
acidic
quality
the
heavily
roasted
barley
flavor
contributes
heavily
to
the
beers
character
a
little
bitterness
starts
in
the
midtaste
and
continues
through
the
finish
but
is
never
dominant
theres
also
a
little
oily
slickness
that
stays
throughout
the
entire
sip
the
body
is
very
full
and
thick
with
an
incredibly
smooth
mouthfeel
good
stout
pours
a
dark
redbrown
huge
thick
tan
head
forms
nice
lacing
good
retention
certainly
looks
like
a
stout
smell
is
sweet
some
caramel
coffeechocolate
roast
fruits
interesting
taste
is
light
and
sweet
some
toffee
licorice
bit
of
roast
other
wise
nothing
very
weak
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
not
very
pleasant
watery
avoid
md
very
smooth
due
to
the
oats
in
the
mix
i
suppose
while
the
carbonation
is
attenuated
ideal
for
this
style
overall
this
stout
benefits
from
a
good
length
of
hop
bitterness
on
top
of
the
usual
presence
of
roastiness
making
it
a
quaffable
stout
with
an
enticing
kick
to
hook
the
palate
too
sweet
aftertaste
light
roasted
overall
an
excellent
and
well
balanced
example
of
a
stout
recommended
mouthfeel
full
body
pert
carbonation
smooth
texture
slight
astringency
on
the
teeth
pours
a
clear
but
very
dark
reddish
brown
under
a
one
finger
tan
head
that
settles
very
slowly
leaving
some
very
nice
sheets
of
lace
at
first
then
settling
to
strings
the
nose
has
a
clear
floral
pine
scent
slightly
subdued
but
unmistakeable
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
wellcarbonated
very
interesting
taste
it
opens
like
an
ipa
slightly
sour
malt
followed
by
coniferous
hoppy
bitter
only
much
later
does
a
bit
of
roasted
smokiness
emerge
the
hops
never
go
away
leaving
a
very
floral
finish
and
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
taste
brew
albeit
a
rather
odd
stout
i
was
a
bit
skepticle
at
first
what
with
the
clear
bottle
but
it
poured
a
nice
deep
brownmahogany
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
smell
is
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
taste
is
rich
and
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
coffee
aftertaste
really
a
nice
allaround
stout
it
doesnt
knock
you
over
the
head
with
chocolate
coffee
smokeyroasted
barley
or
alcohol
its
just
a
nice
easily
drinkable
stout
grab
a
bottle
or
two
the
novel
label
threw
me
off
for
a
long
time
i
hesitated
to
purchase
this
because
i
was
afraid
that
it
wasnt
a
serious
brew
a
great
surprise
now
if
they
switch
to
a
brown
bottle
as
ive
heard
that
they
are
doing
it
will
be
perfect
nice
and
dark
with
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
rich
with
hints
of
caramel
and
roasted
malts
tastes
great
roasted
malts
make
their
way
to
a
subtle
bitterness
which
leaves
for
a
slight
but
not
overpowering
aftertaste
pretty
drinkable
but
pretty
thick
not
something
you
could
drink
a
bunch
of
but
certainly
is
a
nice
example
of
an
english
stout
well
i
like
stout
and
this
is
a
pretty
decent
one
really
dark
and
dry
an
ipalike
fresh
hoparoma
rather
thin
to
be
a
stout
but
it
is
like
a
dry
irish
stout
with
hoppy
afterglow
roasted
black
malt
and
oats
with
a
nice
finish
of
progress
hops
this
is
a
velvety
smooth
stout
with
a
full
dry
and
biscuity
flavor
and
a
clean
cut
aromatic
bitterness
light
flavor

mouthfeel
smooth
easy
drink
great
bottle
and
nice
black
appearance
roasty
smell
uncomplicated
taste
not
too
malted
and
malts
a
taste
taken
away
at
end
of
dryish
finish
d
medium
stouts
arent
something
i
knock
back
a
lot
of
and
theres
nothing
special
about
this
one
that
would
make
me
want
to
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
ruby
in
places
the
head
formed
was
a
medium
tan
and
thick
with
fairly
good
retention
smells
malty
with
a
chocolate
overtone
quite
nice
the
taste
is
sort
of
woodsy
with
a
lot
of
coffee
in
the
finish
and
some
very
subtle
bitterness
feels
a
bit
thin
but
still
very
drinkable
a
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
it
is
different
not
your
mothers
english
stout
the
licorice
flavor
is
quirky
and
its
weird
how
the
mouthfeel
thins
out
in
the
middle
of
your
swig
but
it
is
interesting
and
i
would
drink
another
if
i
had
the
chance
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
enjoyable
without
being
so
thick
that
it
had
caused
a
syruptype
of
thickness
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
but
only
a
couple
due
to
the
weight
of
this
stout
black
in
color
with
some
hints
of
red
theres
hardly
any
aroma
to
this
beer
and
hardly
any
flavor
either
theres
some
suggestion
of
black
patent
and
some
caramel
malts
but
those
flavors
are
faint
at
best
the
body
is
also
thin
and
watery
the
only
real
stout
like
quality
that
it
has
is
its
color
all
in
all
a
decent
stout
one
i
would
like
to
try
fresh
one
day
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
with
roasted
velvety
malts
there
are
some
fruity
hops
and
a
fullbodied
taste
the
long
aftertaste
is
creamy
with
some
delicate
bitterness
coffee
and
toffee
pouring
from
wychwoods
uniquely
shaped
clear
bottle
the
beer
is
opaque
thick
black
though
a
little
dark
brown
near
the
edges
the
head
starts
large
and
fine
and
seems
to
shrink
very
quickly
staying
for
most
of
my
drink
at
about
1or
2
cm
swirling
the
glass
a
little
improved
the
creaminess
of
it
the
foam
is
light
brown
almost
red
in
some
spots
leaving
fast
moving
screens
of
lace
a
moderate
appearance
for
a
stout
nothing
extraordinary
i
get
more
brown
ale
aromas
than
stout
ones
but
that
is
certainly
nothing
which
detracts
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweeter
than
some
stouts
more
caramellike
with
fresh
bread
and
a
good
deal
of
flowery
hops
creamy
mocha
raisins
and
mostly
a
typical
stout
aroma
except
the
greater
sweetness
the
aroma
is
the
best
aspect
of
this
beer
i
get
lactose
up
front
on
the
tongue
good
malt
in
the
middle
and
sweetish
almost
sour
bread
on
the
finish
treacle
more
raisins
chocolate
cherry
nuts
caramel
i
enjoyed
the
subdued
dryness
of
this
stout
on
the
finish
indeed
i
am
left
more
with
sweet
malt
than
any
hop
dryness
mouthfeel
this
beer
needs
much
more
substance
in
the
mouth
it
is
far
too
light
feeling
for
a
stout
though
it
does
render
the
brew
easily
drinkable
creamy
carbonation
silky
though
a
little
watery
while
this
is
not
my
favourite
stout
i
would
buy
it
again
the
flavour
is
there
it
just
needs
to
reach
its
potential
through
increased
body
and
mouthfeel
pours
a
deepest
crimsonblack
color
with
a
thin
light
tan
head
aromas
of
black
patent
malts
a
hint
of
currantlike
fruitiness
a
hint
of
clover
honey
and
a
lot
of
earthy
undertones
tastes
almost
more
like
a
fruity
porter
than
a
stout
but
it
is
all
about
the
flavor
the
malt
is
the
predominant
taste
in
the
beer
and
it
has
a
faint
astringency
throughout
the
beer
slightly
winey
and
earthy
a
little
thin
but
definitely
not
lacking
in
flavor
easily
drinkable
like
many
beers
from
the
u
k
first
product
from
wychwood
i
have
seen
and
tasted
clear
500
ml
bottle
embossed
with
wychwood
around
bottom
and
broom
riding
witch
on
shoulder
black
liquid
that
poured
to
a
full
tan
head
with
large
bubbles
almost
had
a
bit
of
cascade
action
happening
it
has
an
aroma
of
burnt
caramel
and
coffee
strong
but
not
overpowering
taste
is
ok
but
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
very
bitter
and
hoppy
almost
harsh
when
you
expect
a
smoother
body
had
a
lingering
sourish
after
taste
not
bad
bit
bland
not
particularly
strong
flavours
500
ml
bottle
bought
in
denmark
very
dark
reddish
brown
colour
moderate
thick
tan
head
moderate
but
pleasant
roasted
aroma
hints
of
tar
and
old
woodwork
flavour
is
all
roasted
malts
a
bit
thin
mouthfeel
compared
to
some
other
stouts
but
refreshing
no
masterpiece
but
nice
enough
500
ml
clear
glass
bottle
best
before
date
on
back
label
in
the
mouth
it
feels
smooth
and
easydrinking
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
richness
that
doesnt
add
weight
i
really
like
it
poured
from
a
500
ml
clear
bottle
a
dark
coffee
coloured
body
with
a
small
creamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
and
leaves
some
slight
lacing
dark
mahogany
highlights
when
held
up
to
direct
sunlight
smells
of
light
roasted
malt
some
licorice
and
coffee
a
touch
of
chocolate
but
all
very
faint
and
watered
down
i
tried
a
new
bottle
from
the
one
i
originally
reviewed
and
found
it
far
more
flavourful
and
robust
than
from
my
first
sample
starts
out
with
dry
roasted
malts
and
quickly
picks
up
a
chocolate
sweetness
in
the
middle
finishing
with
a
sticky
hybrid
of
sweet
malt
chocolate
and
licorice
dry
espresso
and
almost
a
burnt
character
come
out
on
the
aftertaste
a
little
bit
of
charcoal
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
with
decent
body
but
light
enough
to
make
it
enjoyably
quaffable
im
rather
glad
i
went
back
and
tried
another
one
of
these
over
a
year
later
i
had
picked
up
a
subpar
bottle
initially
and
had
all
but
written
this
stuff
off
a
decent
stout
all
things
considered
even
though
i
still
have
to
get
over
the
stigma
of
the
clear
bottle
if
it
were
presented
as
an
ale
wouldve
received
a
few
more
points
overall
disappointing
as
a
stout
but
nice
to
drink
nonetheless
would
probably
have
again
just
not
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
creamy
stout
this
beer
was
the
odd
man
out
in
this
tasting
i
like
stouts
figured
this
would
be
a
traditional
one
as
its
from
the
uk
bzzzt
wrong
i
didnt
expect
much
with
arty
label
and
the
trendoid
embossed
clear
bottle
but
it
wasnt
skunked
poured
a
lucid
dark
brown
instead
of
the
expected
dead
black
color
of
traditional
stouts
this
looks
more
like
weak
porter
the
pour
and
i
hated
to
defile
such
trendy
packaging
actually
opening
it
and
drinking
the
artfully
wrapped
contents
was
anticlimactic
what
you
saw
in
the
bottle
was
what
you
got
in
the
glass
low
carbonation
weak
nose
some
coffee
some
malt
very
weak
stated
watery
for
a
stout
mediumlight
malt
body
outbalanced
by
hops
finish
comes
too
fast
with
nothing
left
on
the
tongue
to
impress
but
a
bit
of
astringency
this
would
be
a
passable
mega
porter
if
it
had
more
malt
character
not
bad
but
not
good
and
the
package
is
overstated
for
the
contents
poured
to
an
almost
ashpalt
coloured
body
with
a
thinning
brown
head
that
tried
its
best
to
linger
the
hop
combination
seemed
to
take
the
life
out
of
the
aroma
but
certainly
hues
of
burnt
chocolate
and
nutmeg
are
apparent
at
different
stages
of
consumption
lack
of
sweetness
and
the
less
then
filling
feeling
too
watery
left
me
somewhat
perturbed
as
to
why
this
is
classified
as
a
stout
the
4
5
abv
should
have
given
me
a
clue
not
one
of
wychwood
brewings
best
this
stout
looks
kind
of
like
a
porter
its
dark
dark
brownalmost
black
rather
than
extremely
black
the
head
is
long
lasting
and
leaves
concentric
sheets
of
lace
behind
the
aroma
is
strong
i
opened
the
bottle
walked
across
the
room
and
from
there
i
could
smell
the
black
malts
and
hops
the
taste
is
is
hoppier
than
most
uk
stouts
with
a
citrusy
character
the
malts
are
complex
with
quite
a
subdued
burnt
taste
and
a
lot
of
chocolate
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
full
as
other
stouts
rather
on
the
thin
side
that
being
said
the
excellent
balance
of
this
brew
and
the
modest
abv
make
it
very
drinkable
its
not
that
filling
dry
i
would
buy
this
again
when
i
need
a
stout
that
doesnt
make
me
change
to
another
style
after
one
glass
the
best
ive
had
from
wychwood
thus
far
fresh
bottle
so
their
was
no
light
struck
aroma
poured
a
vicious
tar
black
colour
with
a
two
finger
head
the
head
disippated
to
film
about
halfway
down
the
glass
dark
malt
and
oatmeal
is
smelled
with
a
decent
hop
kick
tasted
a
little
weaker
than
it
smells
little
bitter
hops
little
sweet
malt
some
chocolate
and
oatmeal
cookies
good
slick
mouthfeel
kind
of
a
light
oil
a
decent
beer
not
a
very
memorable
stout
ive
still
to
taste
a
wychwood
beer
that
i
really
like
bottle
dark
black
brew
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
medium
retention
floral
aroma
coming
out
of
my
glass
is
incredible
taste
is
very
sweet
unlike
the
irish
stout
this
is
very
different
and
the
body
is
very
light
im
not
even
sure
this
is
a
stout
but
overall
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
id
like
to
see
the
folks
the
folks
in
witney
ramp
this
one
up
a
bit
since
its
one
of
the
few
english
stouts
that
doesnt
emulate
the
irish
style
with
addition
of
roast
barley
a
decent
stout
a
bit
dry
perhaps
could
be
sweeter
but
a
decent
stout
nevertheless
500ml
bottle
poured
a
dark
black
with
a
massive
chocolate
head
that
slowly
receded
to
a
fine
ring
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
muted
roated
coffee
taste
is
creamy
smooth
and
mild
for
a
stout
but
a
very
enjoyable
drink
i
was
concerned
about
the
clear
glass
bottle
but
thankfully
it
has
suffered
no
ill
effects
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
cool
label
of
course
its
black
with
some
ruby
highlights
a
small
brown
head
tops
it
off
a
good
english
hoppiness
is
present
in
the
aroma
along
with
burnt
coffee
and
some
black
fruits
taste
is
quite
odd
starts
off
with
a
very
buttery
yet
hoppy
taste
then
roasted
malt
dominates
the
aftertaste
if
you
like
english
bitters
youll
love
this
brew
a
very
unique
stout
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
good
stout
drinkability
this
brew
poured
a
medium
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
dark
tan
bubbles
that
left
a
nice
lacing
and
a
dark
brown
body
with
some
carbonation
rising
up
the
side
of
the
glass
it
has
very
nice
malty
aroma
and
an
initially
mild
coffee
flavor
but
finishes
with
a
slight
bite
but
still
very
nice
all
around
it
was
jjust
a
bit
mild
for
a
great
stout
this
was
not
as
strong
of
a
stout
that
i
have
experienced
in
the
past
this
one
was
noticeably
milder
which
i
know
is
not
the
norm
for
a
stout
but
personally
i
prefer
a
milder
tasting
stout
so
i
really
enjoyed
this
particular
one
it
poured
a
thin
head
which
did
not
last
too
long
it
had
excellent
lacing
to
it
this
particular
stout
is
definitely
one
that
i
would
enjoy
drinking
again
sometime
i
really
liked
this
one
i
generally
like
stronger
stouts
but
these
guys
seem
to
do
a
great
job
with
a
moderate
ale
the
head
is
thin
but
present
throughout
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
with
caramel
notes
but
the
first
taste
makes
you
well
aware
of
the
hops
the
beer
warms
you
in
spite
of
its
low
alcohol
content
and
makes
it
well
worth
the
drink
maybe
a
good
session
beer
for
those
that
are
interested
in
that
aspect
the
malts
become
present
as
you
move
through
the
pint
and
are
quite
a
good
combination
definitely
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
black
body
with
clear
mahogany
highlights
at
the
base
of
the
glass
topped
by
a
short
frothy
light
tan
head
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lace
the
nose
expresses
a
roasty
malt
mild
diacetyl
butteriness
and
some
grassy
and
earthy
hops
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
very
fine
and
mild
carbonation
that
leaves
it
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
starts
with
a
charming
semisweet
chocolate
note
and
underlying
butterscotch
that
are
soon
overtaken
by
roastiness
and
then
drying
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
bitter
and
fairly
short
with
only
a
mild
lingering
roastiness
a
bit
onesided
but
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
and
at
is
moderate
strength
it
makes
a
good
session
ale
as
is
the
case
with
many
english
beers
this
is
best
enjoyed
at
cellar
temperature
like
the
other
wychwood
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
this
is
below
average
pours
a
nice
dark
color
with
a
slight
coffee
aroma
but
the
flavor
was
seriously
lacking
thin
and
metallic
and
too
fizzy
maybe
this
is
what
a
lightstruck
stout
tastes
like
damn
these
clear
bottles
standard
dull
black
pour
aptly
named
a
black
wych
creamy
full
rich
bubbly
beige
head
stayed
together
and
fell
down
the
glass
nicely
smell
was
dominated
by
burnt
malt
bitterness
coffee
smells
taste
was
a
bit
more
sweet
some
roasted
chocolate
malt
but
again
super
bitter
strong
finish
the
label
says
imported
english
stout
i
didnt
guess
it
to
be
an
oatmeal
stout
too
much
bitterness
for
me
to
think
of
it
as
an
oatmeal
stout
nice
dry
finish
medium
carbonation
just
gets
a
bit
on
the
thin
watery
side
as
it
nears
the
bottom
of
the
glass
still
very
good
tasty
stout
but
not
as
sweet
and
full
bodied
as
other
oatmeal
stouts
i
have
had
the
black
wych
pours
not
surprisingly
a
black
color
with
a
somewhat
sturdy
tan
head
aroma
is
quite
funky
at
first
damn
clear
bottles
but
after
letting
it
air
out
notes
of
oats
and
roasted
malts
are
present
taste
is
pretty
good
with
hints
of
more
roasted
burnt
malt
coffee
and
oats
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
overall
a
quaffable
oatmeal
stout
nice
opaque
dark
brown
body
with
a
thick
light
brown
head
no
co2
apparent
in
the
body
but
perhaps
its
just
too
dark
to
tell
head
retention
is
a
bit
weak
but
a
thin
lace
still
covers
the
beer
to
the
end
lots
of
lace
left
on
the
glass
weak
aroma
of
coffee
dominates
the
smell
oats
are
noticeable
as
well
excellent
taste
rich
coffee
taste
with
roasted
oats
and
a
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
but
certainly
not
bad
overall
a
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
brew
applesauce

shot
of
wheatgrass

for
uppity
junkies
or
a
description
of
black
wych
you
decide
ruby
edged
black
nether
a
thin
tacky
head
nose
of
newly
dug
holes
and
seasonal
transitions
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
runny
but
overall
a
decent
drinkable
brew
a
non
nitro
stout
this
still
pours
the
perfect
pint
overall
ok
nice
malts
but
briny
flavors
are
strange
and
dont
meld
well
with
the
nice
malts
overall
an
interesting
example
and
quite
enjoyable
never
in
my
wildest
imagination
would
i
ever
have
thought
of
beers
brewed
with
oysters
never
the
less
a
real
easy
drinking
sessionable
stout
poured
on
nitrotap
at
three
tides
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
jet
black
with
a
thin
milk
chocolate
colored
filmy
head
aromas
of
bittersweet
chocolate
saltwater
and
seafood
flavors
are
initially
heavy
dark
roasted
coffee
with
a
smooth
chocolate
undertone
and
flavors
end
with
briney
and
saltwater
oyster
flavors
not
overpowering
but
unmistakably
oyster
so
if
you
arent
a
fan
consider
yourself
forewarned
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
and
smokey
again
with
seafood
characteristics
at
the
end
the
brew
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
very
tasty
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
havent
had
very
many
oyster
stouts
but
this
is
amazing
mineral
water
meets
ice
coffee
very
refreshing
and
i
wish
i
had
a
dozen
pemaquids
on
the
half
shell
to
pair
this
delicious
beer
with
out
of
a
growler
that
was
given
to
me
by
the
mw
brewery
crew
you
all
rock
this
beer
was
an
opaque
black
color
when
i
first
poured
this
beer
out
for
me
and
my
company
it
settled
like
a
guinness
the
head
was
tan
twofingers
thick
and
retained
nicely
as
a
cap
hat
left
very
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
roasted
malt
coffee
unsweetened
chocolate
and
hints
of
brine
the
flavors
were
delicious
and
totally
onpoint
for
a
stout
chocolate
malt
toffee
coffee
touches
of
rich
soil
hints
of
caramel
and
a
little
smoke
as
the
beer
warmed
elements
of
brine
began
to
appear
reflecting
the
one
dozen
oysters
that
were
used
to
brew
this
beer
i
know
how
weird
that
sounds
but
you
really
cant
tell
aside
from
the
touch
of
brine
and
perhaps
a
certain
meaty
depth
that
the
beer
has
the
finish
was
bitter
and
apropos
to
a
stout
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
the
body
was
full
and
the
carbonation
excellent
for
the
style
the
mw
crew
makes
a
number
of
good
beers
but
this
one
really
was
my
personal
favorite
and
a
joy
to
drink
martello
stout
is
a
nofuss
super
approachable
stout
that
still
manages
to
checkoff
all
boxes
for
the
style
englishminded
and
ringing
in
at
a
reasonable
4
8
its
right
in
the
sweetspot
for
a
goto
social
settings
pint
and
i
believe
is
best
enjoyed
exactly
as
that
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
lighter
shade
of
black
with
minor
bubble
and
just
thing
lacing
a
nose
of
delicious
roasted
malts
and
espresso
taste
follows
the
nose
but
adds
notes
of
vanilla
offset
by
bitter
cocoa
exceptional
finish
with
malt
coffee
linger
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
the
look
and
smell
lead
you
to
believe
you
are
headed
for
a
fantastic
experience
and
the
taste
and
feel
just
let
you
down
a
little
overall
this
beer
has
been
worth
the
wait
for
me
i
wouldnt
go
as
far
as
to
say
its
the
best
stout
around
but
it
matches
picaroons
gold
medal
winning
timber
hog
and
gahans
sydney
street
stout
im
glad
its
in
stock
here
now
its
a
great
flavourful
english
stout
o
this
is
a
great
stout
it
has
a
balanced
bitterness
to
malt
carbonation
is
well
present
yet
does
not
distract
from
flavours
flavours
are
well
balanced
non
competing
all
complementing
overall
a
good
representation
of
an
english
stout
by
garrison
as
soon
as
i
got
a
whiff
of
this
brews
aromas
i
knew
i
was
in
for
a
flavourful
stout
appearance
could
use
a
little
work
i
would
have
preferred
better
head
retention
one
of
the
better
garrison
offerings
that
i
have
tried
fantastic
love
garrison
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
will
purchase
again
whenever
i
find
it
overall
definitely
an
above
average
stout
that
reminded
me
a
little
of
the
st
ambroise
oatmeal
stout
which
is
also
good
its
worth
trying
if
you
happen
to
see
it
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
beers
from
this
brewer
overall
good
stout
not
too
sweet
and
a
little
nice
smokeyness
o
tasty
up
front
but
the
lingering
finish
is
not
ideal
decent
but
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
stout
d
i
have
to
admit
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
stouts
but
this
one
certainly
exceeded
expectations
o
overall
a
pretty
tasty
offering
but
by
no
means
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
tried
could
be
a
tad
sweeter
and
the
bitterness
was
a
little
too
much
for
my
liking
a
dry
stout
all
the
way
around
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
selections
ive
tried
from
garrison
so
far
worth
checking
out
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
theres
lots
of
flavors
that
keep
you
entertained
also
with
the
lower
abv
this
would
be
a
great
session
stout
stout
is
my
preferred
type
of
alcoholic
beverage
and
this
one
is
my
personal
favorite
this
will
speak
for
itself
when
you
try
it
i
feel
that
it
sets
a
standard
for
stout
in
general
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
exceptional
if
you
enjoy
stout
this
is
a
must
to
try
a
pleasant
enough
oldschool
stout
lots
of
approachable
flavours
and
the
lower
strength
makes
for
a
potential
run
on
the
keg
if
one
had
such
an
opportunity
for
now
though
im
content
with
the
single
serving
that
has
come
such
a
distance
within
its
own
country
to
stand
before
me
just
got
this
from
a
private
order
into
ontario
pours
opaque
brown
with
bubbly
tan
head
head
retention
is
pretty
average
some
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
though
smells
of
huge
roasted
malt
flavour
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
quite
sweet
with
some
roasty
bitterness
in
the
flavour
the
roast
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
medium
body
carbonation
level
a
very
nice
stout
id
drink
this
frequently
if
this
was
readily
available
tome
thanks
and
cheers
long813
very
drinkable
this
one
was
very
good
i
thought
id
like
it
but
was
surprised
at
how
much
i
did
bottle
poured
a
opaque
black
colored
stout
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
roasted
coffee
notes
with
dry
undertones
taste
is
also
a
nice
enough
mix
between
some
roasted
coffee
and
light
black
chocolate
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
well
enough
brewed
and
easily
drinkable
body
has
light
creamy
texture
with
good
carbonation
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
mocha
head
atop
it
that
lingers
and
laces
fantastic
looking
beer
a
nice
stout
nose
with
aromas
of
roasted
barley
licorice
and
predominantly
molasses
the
beer
has
a
bitter
roasted
flavour
about
it
which
is
decently
balanced
by
some
sweetness
in
the
body
flavours
of
molasses
and
a
light
breadiness
are
apparent
the
beer
doesnt
linger
long
in
the
mouth
and
feels
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
imo
enjoyable
and
nice
d
not
a
bad
stout
slightly
lacking
in
mouthfeel
and
appearance
but
still
quite
drinkable
as
it
warms
one
of
the
better
garrison
beers
overall
a
solid
seasonal
offering
from
garrison
and
one
that
i
would
pick
up
again
in
comparison
to
the
american
stouts
ive
had
recently
everything
from
the
nose
to
the
taste
seems
more
subdued
but
at
the
same
time
it
seems
easier
to
drink
thats
of
course
due
to
the
different
style
of
stout
nonetheless
an
excellent
beer
and
worth
picking
up
for
4
8
i
was
pretty
impressed
by
this
beer
thanks
long813
for
this
one
another
underrated
beer
from
the
east
coast
d
very
good
beer
and
first
of
this
style
for
me
has
the
characteristics
of
a
dry
stout
but
the
flavour
of
a
american
its
one
to
try
out
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
i
bid
you
peace
d
a
great
drinker
poured
into
a
mug
a
jet
black
with
a
thick
chocolate
colored
head
head
evaporate
down
to
about
a
finger
and
stuck
around
leaving
lacing
down
the
glass
strong
scent
of
malts
and
toffee
rich
flavor
of
chocolate
toffee
and
roasted
coffee
feels
slightly
thick
but
not
really
heavy
in
the
mouth
very
smooth
overall
and
quite
drinkable
overall
the
big
dark
roasted
flavours
feel
let
down
by
the
overly
thin
body
very
dark
brown
appearance
thats
more
or
less
bordering
on
black
with
a
small
fizzy
tan
head
smoke
and
toast
in
the
aroma
smoked
and
roasted
malts
in
the
flavour
with
a
touch
of
coffee
lightly
cooked
bacon
and
toasted
wholewheat
bread
after
reading
this
i
think
i
just
described
my
breakfast
and
not
the
beer
carbonation
is
moderate
but
i
think
the
body
is
a
tad
light
for
my
liking
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
stout
and
appears
to
be
one
of
the
better
garrison
offerings
id
get
it
again
drinkability
is
good
the
bitterness
is
just
a
touch
high
but
feels
more
like
coffeechocolate
than
hops
making
it
seem
a
little
less
out
of
balance
the
alcohol
actually
comes
through
more
than
id
expect
for
5
too
overall
a
pretty
solid
brew
tastes
of
roasted
malts
sweetness
hop
bitterness
and
molasses
just
a
bit
thin
but
still
a
great
brew
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
almost
black
some
red
in
the
edges
very
healthy
looking
thick
tan
head
forms
quickly
settles
down
to
a
thin
layer
no
lacing
smell
is
nice
sweet
malt
caramel
roast
chocolate
some
dark
fruits
coffee
very
nice
for
a
light
stout
taste
is
a
little
watery
caramel
chocolate
some
decent
roast
licorice
bit
of
butter
in
the
finish
quite
light
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
solid
but
ive
noticed
with
a
lot
of
garrison
the
flavour
is
a
bit
weak
still
very
serviceable
stout
and
one
i
would
be
happy
to
have
access
to
all
the
time
thanks
greg
thanks
to

a
nice
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
end
as
mentioned
by
other
the
mouthfeel
might
be
a
bit
thin
but
hardly
something
to
complain
about
still
smooth
and
a
bit
creamy
one
of
garrisons
better
beers
i
have
had
the
priveledge
of
trying

for

tomthompson98
for
my
request
four
months
later
neals
bottle
a
malty
sweet
coffee
dry
stout
and
review
is
a
blend
between
the
two
final
statement
the
best
of
garrisons
brews
for
sure
could
be
thicker
and
more
flavorful
but
definately
not
bad
d
a
very
good
brew
yes
i
do
believe
i
will
have
another
yum
appearance
is
similar
to
the
bottled
version
very
dark
with
slight
hints
of
a
lighter
red
tinged
brown
at
the
edges
the
head
however
is
much
more
substantial
than
the
bottled
version
and
a
few
shades
lighter
as
a
result
the
beer
looks
rather
better
than
the
other
serving
type
the
smell
is
very
similar
but
slanted
more
toward
the
coffee
side
and
with
a
hint
of
woodiness
the
taste
is
again
more
coffee
influenced
than
i
remember
the
bottle
and
with
the
same
woody
tones
as
the
smell
which
were
also
absent
in
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
good
creamy
and
rich
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
i
think
its
a
bit
better
on
tap
this
is
a
nice
stout
though
its
anything
but
dry
i
recommend
it
and
the
next
time
im
in
halifax
ill
get
it
again
o
even
as
it
is
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
i
assume
the
acetic
character
was
an
offflavor
but
it
wasnt
enough
to
render
it
undrinkable
at
all
i
just
dont
think
is
what
was
intended
and
certainly
isnt
to
style
still
finished
it
without
a
problem
opening
medium
light
in
body
with
a
prominent
roasty
note
a
grainy
acidity
that
has
flavors
of
coffee
and
cocoa
burnt
caramel
and
a
mildly
briny
and
moderate
chalky
calcium
flavor
the
blend
of
chalk
and
brine
is
excellent
here
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
creamy
dark
chocolate
character
to
go
with
the
lingering
acidity
this
beer
is
delicious
no
date
on
this
but
the
upright
website
shows
this
as
one
of
their
current
beers
eleven
dollar
drainpour
for
me
from
the
750
ml
bottle
bought
yesterday
at
olive
tree
market
in
ocean
beach
overall
a
surprising
enjoyable
twist
on
a
stout
i
didnt
know
quite
what
to
expect
here
and
im
still
not
sure
how
the
oysters
factor
in
i
didnt
distinctly
taste
oyster
in
this
beer
or
at
least
how
i
expected
i
might
but
there
is
a
certain
briny
minerally
quality
that
suggests
their
influence
well
done
upright
overall
oysters
give
this
stout
a
lighter
feel
but
its
a
solid
ale
nonetheless
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
to
higher
level
of
carbonation
it
starts
off
really
fishy
and
transitions
to
more
of
a
classic
mineral
feel
plenty
of
roast
and
seemingly
no
alcohol
inclusion
i
thought
this
brew
was
mighty
interesting
sometimes
i
think
oyster
stouts
are
just
a
novelty
and
hardly
include
enough
to
impart
that
thickerslick
feel
to
the
body
this
brew
nearly
takes
the
oyster
inclusion
over
the
edge
i
liked
it
and
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
sometime
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
was
one
of
few
beers
that
night
i
had
seconds
of
black
with
brownish
hints
the
beer
pours
placidly
with
a
thin
layer
of
tan
foam
on
top
which
itself
has
a
creamy
surface
texture
as
it
settles
theres
a
little
bit
of
spindly
lacing
around
the
edges
roasty
aroma
that
was
dry
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
savory
brininess
that
is
definitely
oyster
flavor
is
also
roasty
with
dry
bakers
chocolate
hints
of
woody
smoke
and
a
savory
hint
of
salinity
the
body
is
creamy
and
silky
smooth
light
to
medium
in
feel
one
of
the
rare
occasions
where
the
oyster
presence
is
actually
noticeable
very
well
integrated
and
flavorful
really
enjoyed
this
thanks
again
eric
i
dont
care
if
nobody
but
me
knows
this
yet
but
this
is
one
of
the
new
classic
ales
of
the
pacific
northwest
the
flavor
of
the
oysters
is
subtle
and
may
very
well
escape
some
people
as
a
chef
for
30
years
im
attuned
to
the
relative
limitations
of
using
oysters
as
a
flavoring
as
in
stuffings
soups
and
sauces
and
i
smelled
and
tasted
them
immediately
the
idea
is
a
natural
as
stout
is
certainly
the
proper
pairing
with
raw
oysters
but
the
expression
here
with
the
creamy
ale
and
the
salty
briny
ocean
tang
is
sublime
in
the
glass
theres
only
a
thready
lace
at
the
rim
and
its
not
more
than
mildly
effervescent
but
the
mouthfeel
is
satiny
and
refined
a
lovey
counterpoint
to
the
earthy
oysters
without
the
oysters
this
would
still
be
a
fine
britstyled
stout
but
with
them
its
utterly
engrossing
and
delicious
i
tasted
it
on
tap
at
the
brewery
and
managed
to
snag
the
last
bottle
left
at
upright
notes
on
that
after
i
open
it
in
about
five
years
review
from
42010
notes
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
dark
brown
appearing
black
one
finger
brown
head
and
lacing
aroma
of
chocolate
dark
and
roasty
malt
flavor
is
somewhat
unusual
although
it
has
the
coffee
roasted
malt
one
would
expect
a
mild
finish
a
little
underwhelming
but
somewhat
richer
than
most
english
stouts
a
somewhat
understated
but
pleasant
english
stout
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
some
slight
coffee
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
get
absolutely
no
hints
of
any
sort
of
oyster
products
being
used
in
the
brewing
process
i
didnt
taste
the
oysters
but
still
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
very
great
find
got
this
in
a
trade
when
i
visited
beautiful
portland
oregon
the
sample
i
got
fizzed
from
hell
to
breakfast
so
it
was
several
minutes
before
i
dared
open
the
cap
fully
without
getting
beer
all
over
me
and
my
room
it
pours
an
opaque
oily
sable
with
a
very
thick
though
not
too
persistent
fluffy
tan
head
that
leaves
a
little
lacing
smoky
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
oyster
and
hints
of
coffee
and
molasses
flavor
definitely
has
an
oyster
tone
and
i
love
oysters
smoky
coffee
nutty
molasses
and
licorice
tones
are
present
as
well
texture
is
thick
smooth
oily
and
fizzy
this
is
worth
seeking
overall
cant
get
any
oyster
out
of
this
but
there
are
some
unique
qualities
in
the
smell
and
taste
that
didnt
work
for
me
my
first
oyster
stout
and
it
was
a
very
interesting
experience
not
something
i
would
want
all
the
time
but
still
quite
enjoyable
medium
to
thick
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
complex
stout
that
drinks
bigger
than
its
abv
the
oyster
part
is
not
that
noticeable
though
there
is
a
slight
iodine
tang
to
the
finish
some
chocolate
notes
but
the
beer
is
more
on
the
austere
side
with
a
dyish
finish
i
really
like
the
complexity
combined
with
great
drinability
the
coffee
stout
from
upright
tastes
like
this
beer
with
a
strong
coffee
flavour
after
being
known
for
saison
and
farmhouse
beers
i
now
see
these
guys
as
top
notch
stout
brewers
the
drinkability
for
this
is
amazingly
good
it
is
very
smooth
the
flavors
blend
very
well
with
each
other
i
could
drink
this
all
day
d
this
is
umami
in
a
glass
folks
it
might
be
my
fore
runner
for
beer
of
the
year
at
this
point
my
first
parlay
into
the
world
of
truffle
infused
beer
and
its
been
a
good
one
as
unique
and
dare
i
say
odd
as
this
beer
is
i
cant
help
but
find
myself
drawn
to
its
originality
and
funkiness
well
done
ganum
you
continue
to
impress
keep
up
your
work
as
the
most
innovative
brewer
in
portland
and
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
and
buy
your
product

tasty
beer
but
the
oysters
are
muted
probably
better
when
extremely
fresh
but
the
beer
drinks
nice
enough
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
tasty
export
stout
very
full
favored
but
more
of
a
sipper
then
a
session
ale
overall
a
very
nicely
built
stout
nice
flavors
d
love
the
intense
smokiness
the
surliness
i
didnt
think
id
like
this
as
much
as
i
did
at
first
sip
had
it
on
several
occasions
as
a
draft
pour
at
the
time
of
its
release
now
some
3
months
later
is
my
first
try
from
the
bottle
quite
tasty
and
as
mentioned
earlier
paired
wonderfully
with
the
cheese
distant
thanks

jones

very
smooth

as
it

at

easy
to
drink
the
body
was
very
nice
full
and
rich
a
pleasure
on
the
tongue
drinkability
was
good
smooth
easy
and
comfortable
overall
a
very
decent
stout
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
despite
the
quality
of
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
overpriced
11
at
my
local
food
coop
89
would
be
a
more
fair
price
d
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
though
the
oyster
quality
is
elusive
i
believe
it
adds
something
worthwhile
to
the
beer
i
would
certainly
drink
this
again
if
given
the
chance
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
never
had
an
oyster
stout
until
now
not
much
oyster
flavor
in
this
one
would
buy
this
beer
again
for
sure
aside
from
the
brinelike
suggestion
of
something
unbeerish
this
ale
mostly
tastes
like

comments
this
is
a
fantastic
stout
oysters
or
not
and
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
oysters
dont
worry
youd
never
know
overall
nothing
special
the
aroma
was
especially
weak
unfortunately
the
flavor
picked
up
the
slack
a
little
though
even
there
it
was
unmemorable
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
per
se
just
nothing
all
that
right
about
it
either
pass
and
try
something
else
would
drink
again
wont
blow
you
away
but
competently
made
worth
a
try
o
a
tasty
stout
though
nothing
mind
blowing
easily
sessioned
and
a
welcome
addition
to
the
local
lcbo
selection
ill
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
over
the
holidays
taste
is
dark
sweetness
to
start
some
oatmeal
in
the
middle
and
a
slight
tartness
to
the
close
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
thin
and
smooth
in
a
flat
beer
way
and
drinkability
is
okay
in
the
it
goes
down
easy
but
again
not
in
an
impressive
manner
this
is
not
all
it
was
cracked
up
to
be
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
decent
flavors
and
aromas
m
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
lingering
finish
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
given
the
price
and
relative
heftofbody
probably
isnt
a
great
session
choice
for
most
people
as
far
as
ocb
stouts
go
this
is
a
very
respectable
choice
that
i
will
probably
imbibe
again
some
time
d
fairly
easy
drinking
if
you
like
a
dark
beer
dark
and
toasty
but
clean
od
not
bad
smells
better
than
it
tastes
but
its
drinkable
and
better
than
expected
not
worth
the
3
50
it
cost
just
kinda
plain
o
a
very
pleasant
surprise
definitely
the
best
offering
i
have
sampled
from
this
brewer
bottle
poured
a
black
color
stout
with
a
large
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
light
lacing
notes
of
light
roasted
malt
with
light
black
chocolate
are
nice
taste
is
a
balanced
mix
between
some
roasted
malt
with
light
black
chocolate
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
well
brewed
with
good
drinkability
factor
though
doesnt
provide
anything
i
havent
seen
before
sufficiently
complex
yet
easy
to
drink
a
beer
i
will
enjoy
again
this
winter
pours
deep
brown
with
one
finger
of
tan
head
and
a
little
lace
smell
is
roasted
malt
fairly
hoppy
coffee
and
chocolate
light
ashy
scents
as
well
taste
is
of
roasted
and
almost
burnt
malt
bittersweet
with
light
sour
notes
coffee
in
the
finish
quite
dry
medium
carbonation
silky
feel
creamy
medium
body
this
wasnt
bad
fairly
good
drinker
and
a
solid
effort
overall
perhaps
just
a
tad
too
much
on
the
sweet
side
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
really
couldnt
drink
more
that
1
in
a
sitting
for
my
money
there
are
better
options
out
there
very
nice
effort
though
a
bit
heavy
to
consider
having
more
than
one
or
two
of
will
pick
up
again
if
it
continues
to
be
bottled
and
id
like
to
see
more
from
this
brewery
overall
never
tasted
a
stout
like
this
before
seems
unbalanced
almond
is
overbearing
too
nutty
and
unsmooth
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
some
clarity
around
the
edges
of
a
deep
ambermahogany
hue
light
brown
head
with
some
retention
and
a
little
lace
nose
of
dark
chocolate
roasty
coffee
grain
notes
and
some
breadycracker
qualities
almost
resembling
that
of
a
chocolate
wafer
taste
has
more
of
these
bready
and
chocolate
waferlike
notes
toasty
malts
milk
chocolate
with
some
roasty
coffee
notes
again
dry
and
toasty
finish
not
sure
if
im
actively
picking
up
any
wheat
notes
so
if
they
are
there
they
are
quite
subtle
some
characteristic
black
creek
hop
flavour
as
well
in
true
english
style
medium
carbonation
with
a
touch
of
grittiness
in
the
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
moderate
drinkability
a
nice
dry
stout
and
one
of
the
better
examples
ive
had
in
the
province
and
certainly
the
best
thing
black
creek
has
done
as
it
often
goes
for
things
like
song
melodies
or
baking
recipes
sometimes
the
simplest
beer
is
the
best
theres
no
bells
or
whistles
to
black
creek
stout
but
it
can
be
every
bit
as
enjoyable
albeit
in
a
much
different
way
as
anything
aged
in
bourbon
barrels
for
some
this
might
be
a
bit
lacking
but
for
the
average
drinker
it
should
suit
them
just
fine
cask
enjoyed
at
the
brewpub
the
porter
stopped
up
this
newly
labelled
a
significant
woodiness
i
believe
purposfully
done
that
adds
to
interest
a
wee
roast
in
aroma
virtually
no
head
mildly
natural
carbonation
dark
colour
chocolate
malt
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
drier
in
the
finish
solid
chocolate
stout
very
drinkable
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
very
chocolaty
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
backbone
yes
the
chocolate
tastes
like
one
of
those
cheap
samplers
you
get
at
the
drug
storebut
hey
thats
the
fruity
chocolate
i
grew
up
with
as
forrest
gump
sayslife
is
like
a
box
of
chocolates
you
never
know
what
you
are
going
to
get
this
is
the
cheap
roman
raspberry
chocolate
piece
but
thats
still
pretty
good
fwiw
i
thought
this
beer
was
decent
and
my
husband
really
likes
it
thin
odd
offtaste
not
good
barely
choked
it
down
only
because
i
dont
like
to
waste
money
3
price
tag
for
bomber
should
have
been
tipoff
never
again
apparently
i
need
to
put
together
a
longer
review
dont
know
why
this
beer
is
just
bad
the
taste
is
overwhelmed
by
the
cherry
or
tart
zestiness
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
for
lack
of
a
better
description
hardly
what
i
expected
from
a
chocolate
stout
chocolate
seems
more
like
an
after
thought
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
probably
one
that
i
wouldnt
buy
again
i
prefer
my
stouts
thicker
with
less
sweetness
coming
through
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
thin
foamy
filmy
light
tan
head
nose
of
toasted
oats
chocolate
syrup
and
some
hints
of
bitter
coffee
flavors
are
sweet
with
the
chocolate
syrup
heavy
on
the
forward
tongue
and
some
roasty
notes
in
the
back
way
too
sweet
and
sugary
for
me
thin
slick
body
that
tries
to
be
creamy
but
misses
the
mark
chocolate
sugar
once
again
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
bittersweet
linger
in
the
slick
finish
not
for
me
but
a
true
chocoholic
might
dig
it
taste
starts
where
the
nose
left
off
but
quickly
makes
way
for
a
tartness
that
becomes
all
encompassing
through
the
rest
of
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
drinkability
is
junk
with
the
sour
character
defining
the
brew
pass
good
fruit
and
cocoa
aspects
to
this
laid
back
and
drinkable
stout
o
not
the
best
chocolate
stout
that
i
have
had
but
a
convincingly
good
english
stout
it
is
dry
and
relatively
drinkable
with
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
overall
swing
and
a
miss
the
beer
underneath
seems
light
and
thin
and
all
that
was
there
was
destroyed
by
possible
infection
sour
icky
fruit
yeasty
flavors
just
bad
o
this
stout
tastes
very
english
in
nature
so
they
definitely
hit
the
mark
in
that
regard
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
in
its
own
right
but
why
is
this
billed
as
a
chocolate
stout
i
can
barely
even
taste
the
chocolate
the
beer
still
has
plenty
of
that
acrid
acidic
bitterness
to
balance
a
little
more
sweetness
adding
more
chocolate
would
go
a
long
way
here
give
the
people
what
they
want
pours

one

that

for
a
22oz

from

warehouse
winooski
vt
this
beer
has
some
problems
i
do
not
know
if
this
was
a
funky
bottle
or
if
this
beer
is
actually
supposed
to
taste
somewhat
sour
regardless
aside
from
the
sourness
there
are
not
a
lot
of
nice
things
going
on
here
overall
i
dont
think
they
can
call
this
chocolate
its
raw
cocoa
powder
thrown
in
a
decent
english
stout
aggressively
bitter
and
dry
definitely
one
of
the
more
unique
takes
on
using
chocolate
ive
encountered
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
creamy

head

taste

and
light
coffee
with
a

and
a
bit
of
lactose
sweetness
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
light
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
oily
mouthfeel
nothing
objectionable
here
but
nothing
horribly
exciting
either
id
have
loved
some
more
body
and
maybe
some
more
chocolate
the
aroma
seemed
promising
but
there
may
have
been
problems
with
the
fermentation
that
lead
to
the
offflavors
overall
all
i
can
think
of
when
drinking
this
beer
is
ok
where
is
the
chocolate
i
was
certainly
expecting
more
but
it
is
the
coffee
that
dominates
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
i
will
pass
in
the
future
overall
a
decent
beer
but
lacking
in
carbonation
a
solid
chocolate
stout
its
not
youngs
chocolate
stout
but
itll
do
for
a
local

in
the
future
as
winter
rolls
around
d
moderate
drinkability
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
but
im
currently
unimpressedwould
try
again
to
give
it
another
go
d
fairly
easy
drinking
beer
abv
is
in
the
sessionable
range
for
an
english
stout
i
would
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
due
to
its
smooth
texture
and
not
being
very
filling
d
this
is
a
very
bland
tasteless
beer
with
a
dark
color
the
only
real
flavor
was
the
sour
note
and
even
that
was
soft
with
a
softer
black
malt
note
it
was
hard
to
get
through
a
full
imp
pint
of
this
stuff
additional
notes
one
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
recently
mouthfeel
mediumfull
body
gentler
carbonation
soft
texture
pours
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
is
cocoa
flavor
is
roasted
a
bit
malty
but
the
overall
profile
seems
to
thin
out
a
bit
feel
has
a
decent
body
and
the
carbonation
is
about
what
youd
expect
this
is
a
nice
english
stout
i
feel
like
its
a
good
opportunity
for
someone
to
really
taste
and
feel
what
the
differences
are
between
american
and
english
stouts
beautiful
blackish
brown
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thick
creamy
tan
head
with
some
nice
lacing
smells
creamy
but
slightly
acrid
and
sour
from
the
roasted
grain
and
this
unpleasantness
lowers
the
score
here
the
taste
is
much
better
there
is
still
a
tad
of
that
grainy
sourness
up
front
but
this
quickly
gives
way
to
a
smooth
slightly
roasty
creaminess
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
on
the
lighter
side
enjoyable
overall
d
decent
drinkability
and
flavor
a
nice
finish
and
easy
to
handle
stout
md
very
well
bottleconditioned
this
bottled
version
goes
beyond
my
expectation
with
all
the
healthy
fizziness
to
lift
up
the
weight
besides
a
balance
is
obtained
bw
roated
malts
and
hops
hence
overall
a
product
that
cannot
be
disliked
in
any
respect
imo
best
of
all
its
extremely
quaffable
the
taste
gave
a
slight
off
flavor
when
drinking
it
maybe
it
was
the
malt
sticking
to
the
tongue
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
more
carbonated
brews
i
have
drank
to
date
this
is
a
five
minute
pour
type
of
guy
the
best
way
to
enjoy
the
hops
of
this
brew
is
to
sip
the
huge
head
overall
it
was
okay
but
the
back
of
the
label
really
talked
it
up
damn
marketing
i
would
try
it
again
maybe
i
had
it
too
warm
drinks
very
easy
this
was
better
on
cask
but
then
again
most
english
offerings
are
solid
session
stout
d
very
drinkable
low
abv
thin
body
would
like
to
try
on
tap
someday
d
its
a
nice
session
beer
low
abv
i
could
have
a
couple
without
needing
a
nap
but
then
again
its
kinda
unremarkable
so
ill
probably
never
have
another
taste
is
a
tad
sweet
with
smoky
malt
and
chocolate
roasted
malt
finish
and
a
little
dry
very
easy
to
drink
a
fine
example
i
could
stand
a
little
higher
abv
palate
is
rich
and
roasty
up
front
with
a
mellow
bitterness
from
the
hops
emerging
before
the
swallow
notes
of
licorice
dark
chocolate
and
chicory
linger
in
the
background
body
is
stout
yet
not
thick
which
is
to
be
expected
in
a
lowalcohol
stout
an
approachable
easydrinking
sessionable
stout
one
of
the
more
interesting
and
very
nice
english
stouts
i
have
had
still
prefer
them
on
cask
but
this
is
quite
good
other
than
the
slightly
distracting
bitterness
this
is
not
a
bad
stout
i
rather
like
it
i
find
the
carbonation
is
just
right
and
this
is
sessionable
in
the
way
the
guinness
is
the
body
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
fairly
light
light
yet
creamy
the
4
5
abv
obviously
cant
be
detected
or
felt
until
after
quite
a
few
more
making
this
seem
more
like
a
roasted
barley
and
hop
tea
than
an
actual
beer
i
kind
of
like
that
though
good
notes
all
of
the
taste
components
are
subtle
and
uneventfull
500ml
brown
bottle
purchased
at
oaktree
buy
rite
poured
into
my
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
tan
head
smells
of
over
roasted
coffee
and
something
i
can
only
describe
as
the
aroma
coming
from
a
hair
salon
when
someone
is
getting
a
perm
terrible
aroma
tastes
of
burnt
coffee
and
overly
roasted
grains
as
well
as
bitter
cocoa
thin
in
body
with
medium
carbonation
i
could
not
finish
the
bottle
due
to
the
very
strong
perm
aromas
overrall
a
very
drinkable
but
somewhat
forgettable
beer
picked
this
one
up
from
spirit
haus
last
night
poured
approproately
enough
into
my
spirit
haus
english
pint
glass
a
complete
black
with
no
heading
smell
was
incredibly
smooth
with
silky
milk
chocolate
some
roasted
husk
and
a
bit
of
mild
fruit
in
the
background
taste
was
also
quite
nice
with
much
of
the
same
chocolate
smoothness
and
a
bit
of
coffee
surfacing
as
well
mouthfeel
was
like
i
said
really
smooth
making
it
all
the
more
drinkable
i
will
have
to
pick
up
more
english
stouts
in
the
future
as
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
went
perfect
with
lunch
today
cheers
it
pours
a
clear
almost
black
body
with
deep
mahogany
highlights
beneath
a
short
head
of
creamy
tan
foam
some
yeast
sediment
settles
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
occassional
veryfine
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
steadily
towards
the
surface
the
combination
of
its
fine
bottleconditioned
moderate
carbonation
and
mediumlight
body
leave
it
silkysmooth
across
the
palate
the
nose
expresses
a
dark
slightly
acrid
bittersweet
chocolate
maltiness
and
some
yeasty
fruitiness
that
encompasses
both
dark
and
light
skinned
fruits
plum
red
berries
the
flavor
follows
pretty
much
exactly
with
its
dark
maltiness
expressing
a
bit
of
roastiness
and
some
caramel
and
reigning
over
the
gentle
fruitiness
a
subtle
touch
of
grassy
and
leafy
hops
lend
it
some
depth
the
bitterness
is
restrained
but
solid
allowing
the
malt
some
room
to
play
but
anchoring
it
completely
in
the
dry
roasty
and
slightly
acrid
finish
its
quite
drinkable
in
that
its
lighter
in
body
and
maltiness
and
doesnt
overwhelm
the
palate
and
it
still
has
enough
flavor
and
depth
to
keep
it
interesting
for
more
than
or
two
its
not
a
pint
that
id
go
for
if
i
was
having
only
one
but
for
a
night
out
with
the
lads
id
more
than
care
for
a
few
of
these
cheers
overall
an
excellent
stout
very
dry
and
very
drinkable
simply
an
excellent
session
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
brilliant
ruby
highlights
and
a
fluffy
light
brown
head
chunky
lacing
stuck
to
the
glass
as
the
head
fell
lots
of
roast
in
the
aroma
not
really
coffee
though
sweet
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
rounded
it
out
a
bit
malty
and
roasted
flavour
low
bitterness
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
theres
also
a
bit
of
sourness
too
full
bodied
moderate
carbonation
it
really
coated
the
palate
if
it
wasnt
for
the
metallic
character
which
really
became
distracting
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
as
it
is
its
still
passable
i
really
fancied
this
beer
great
head
upon
pour
which
vanishes
quickly
but
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
just
ok
a
bit
of
musty
roast
coffee
was
my
best
guess
the
taste
is
a
bit
tartespresso
and
very
smooth
a
bit
of
a
complex
guinness
very
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
too
exceptional
but
not
bad
by
any
means
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
substantial
tan
head
smell
is
of
deep
roast
and
mild
fruity
esters
initial
entry
onto
the
palate
is
sweet
with
substantial
toffee
and
chocolate
notes
coupled
with
some
light
fruitcherry
esters
slight
chocolate
feel
to
it
earthy
hops
emerge
amidst
this
and
dry
through
the
finish
along
with
the
bitterness
of
the
roasted
malt
unfortunately
i
found
this
a
bit
too
acrid
and
biting
roasted
barley
burnt
bitter
char
through
the
finish
and
while
otherwise
decent
a
major
annoyance
makes
the
beer
come
across
as
disjointed
a
large
gap
in
the
malt
profile
body
was
medium
light
with
medium
yet
assertive
carbonation
creating
a
slightly
aggressvie
mouthfeel
which
when
coupled
with
acridity
is
not
so
good
drinkability
is
hurt
due
to
what
i
perceive
as
being
too
much
black
roast
its
a
drinkable
enough
stout
but
i
dare
say
i
would
not
pay
5
again
when
i
can
get
much
better
and
much
cheaper
american
stouts
here
entire
stout
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
a
decent
head
from
a
brown
16
9
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
of
chocolate
and
coffee
the
taste
also
has
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
but
also
some
other
things
going
on
at
one
point
early
on
there
was
an
almost
but
not
quite
metallic
taste
and
toward
the
end
possibly
some
hops
not
bad
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
definitely
worth
a
try
by
the
way
this
is
a
100
vegan
bottle
conditioned
stout
complex
taste
immediate
hits
warm
roasted
notes
with
chocostouty
tasrtes
and
lots
of
mouthfeel
nothing
to
stop
the
presses
about
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
and
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
dozen
it
handsdown
beats
all
of
the
american
stouts
i
reveiewed
over
the
last
week
almost
pitch
black
hold
it
right
over
a
light
and
some
dark
reddish
colors
peek
through
good
tan
head
plenty
of
tracings
there
is
a
strong
roasted
aroma
on
the
nose
which
sticks
around
on
the
palate
along
with
definite
chocolate
flavors
as
well
as
a
crisp
but
mostly
mild
hop
bitterness
there
is
a
somewhat
unsettling
metallic
taste
that
migrates
around
the
palate
from
the
fore
to
the
aftertaste
then
seems
to
fade
away
at
this
point
the
aftertaste
becomes
predominently
roast
maltcentric
for
a
stout
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
not
palatecoating
and
quite
enjoyable
better
than
average
drinkability
but
the
heavy
roasted
malt
flavor
might
get
old
taste
is
nice
and
bitter
with
a
thick
roasted
malt
flavor
quite
nice
a
bit
smokey
in
the
finish
as
well
very
nice
stout
drinkability
the
phenols
slightly
undermined
what
is
a
pretty
good
session
stout
still
not
bad
pours
a
beautiful
head
with
a
strong
lacing
its
jet
black
and
crisp
looking
smell
dark
malt
with
a
sweet
hint
of
hints
tastes
like
hops
with
a
malty
coffee
taste
in
the
end
feels
watery
but
smooth
in
my
mouth
its
fairly
drinkable
a
sipping
beer
also
great
when
complimented
with
food
dark
brown
and
not
quite
opaque
aromas
of
chocolate
and
espresso
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
this
beer
will
taste
great
however
the
flavors
are
not
quite
up
to
snuff
lots
of
licorice
and
a
sweet
grapey
malt
mess
with
just
faint
notes
of
the
coffee
that
was
present
in
the
aroma
its
also
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
and
it
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
nice
deep
ruby
colored
beer
had
a
slight
tan
head
at
first
low
roasted
aroma
very
mild
licorice
smell
to
it
good
roasted
malt
flavor
grainy
somewhat
coffeeish
taste
to
it
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
my
liking
an
enojoyable
beer
overall
and
a
nice
of
example
of
an
english
stout
that
is
quite
reserved
compared
to
its
us
counterparts
it
is
generously
carbonated
but
it
is
a
little
light
in
body
for
a
stout
dark
brown
color
milky
aromas
and
flavors
bring
tangy
watery
roasted
coffee
notes
creamy
mousse
pleasantly
bone
dry
and
an
adequate
expanse
of
fruit
and
chocolate
flavor
make
it
a
good
stout
this
is
a
delicious
drink
not
cerebral
nothing
audacious
but
appealing
for
what
it
is
overall
sadly
the
last
of
my
cask
reviews
from
my
uk
easter
trip
and
i
have
to
say
a
bloody
reet
good
un
it
was
tortuous
to
drag
myself
away
from
the
baroque
after
only
the
one
pint
scrumptious
lovely
dark
tasty
stout
one
of
the
better
stouts
on
cask
in
the
uk
for
my
money
and
it
is
certainly
one
which
i
will
always
invest
in
when
i
get
chance
an
entirely
superb
stout
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
not
the
best
stout
i
ever
had
in
fact
this
may
be
a
stout
by
english
standards
but
here
it
would
be
considered
a
porter
hmmmm
not
sweet
roasty
not
totally
black
sounds
like
a
porter
to
me
glad
i
like
porters
give
it
a
shot
for
s
g
the
color
is
almost
black
with
an
averagesized
light
brown
head
decent
lacings
are
left
behind
the
aroma
has
a
rich
roasted
smell
chocolate
and
coffee
are
noted
with
just
a
bit
of
something
that
smells
peatlike
the
taste
is
strong
on
roasted
flavors
and
has
an
overall
earthy
essence
again
with
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
great
stuff
here
a
great
choice
to
kick
back
with
the
pour
is
a
dark
amber
color
liquid
flowing
into
the
glass
with
nary
a
head
to
speak
of
aromas
of
chocolate
and
sour
fruit
reminiscent
of
most
standard
stouts
flavor
leaves
a
little
bit
lacking
its
roasty
and
sour
and
fuller
than
your
average
stout
but
mouthfeel
just
isnt
altogether
there
theres
hardly
any
body
to
speak
of
drinkability
is
high
even
though
its
an
okay
beer
one
could
stick
to
this
all
night
and
never
look
back
im
somewhat
surprised
at
the
less
than
4
average
this
beer
is
currently
averaging
its
pretty
darned
good
pours
a
dark
black
color
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
smell
is
malty
and
stoutlike
taste
is
very
good
malty
with
subtle
hops
on
the
aftertaste
what
really
surprised
me
about
this
beer
however
is
its
drinkability
it
really
reminds
me
of
an
english
brown
in
that
it
goes
down
so
smooth
it
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
and
i
think
that
is
somewhat
unusual
for
a
stout
recommended
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
dry
black
malt
scent
that
boasts
of
patent
and
chocolate
malts
it
has
a
roasted
quality
that
is
very
pleasant
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
dark
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
it
is
not
too
thick
and
has
a
fine
malt
palate
the
hops
add
a
nice
zing
and
balance
to
an
already
good
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
english
stout
it
has
good
flavor
and
aroma
an
excellent
sessions
ale
drinkability
is
average
at
best
probably
a
good
beer
close
to
home
but
this
bottled
version
tht
made
a
trip
to
the
us
just
doesnt
make
it
wonderfully
dark
can
barely
see
through
this
just
some
ruby
seen
at
the
edges
when
held
to
the
light
nice
thick
creamy
beige
head
that
managed
to
stay
as
a
good
heavy
ring
amazing
scents
of
darkly
rich
hops
espresso
and
chocolate
maybe
a
it
of
oaky
whiskeyness
and
even
a
bit
of
terriyaki
came
out
towards
the
end
very
good
mouthfeel
just
flows
over
your
tongue
the
carbination
is
just
barely
there
so
that
is
nice
for
me
taste
is
nice
not
too
intense
expected
it
to
be
very
powerful
but
is
so
nicely
drinkable
dark
roasted
malt
taste
chocolate
and
black
coffee
house
red
wine
very
tastey
last
swigs
a
basic
english
stout
not
my
favorite
style
but
decent
thanks
to
shapudding
for
the
brew
pretty
poor
stout
horrible
drinkability
i
swallowed
a
massive
chunk
of
yeast
which
tasted
like
coal
nasty
off
flavours
and
no
balance
might
have
been
a
bit
off
a
pretty
awful
beer
i
couldnt
even
get
halfway
through
a
pint
this
might
have
been
off
this
is
an
admirable
session
beer
with
a
pleasant
chocolate
flavor
and
a
sweetness
just
balanced
out
by
the
hops
pours
a
deep
brownnot
quite

of

flavors
are
packed
into
this
one
a
stout
low
in
alcohol
i
could
more
than
one
pint
of
these
i
would
get
again
as
a
nice
night
cap
or
sessiontype
stout
hopback
entire
stout
is
better
than
anticipated
it
leaves
a
copious
amount
of
lace
its
tasty
and
its
eminently
drinkable
bottom
line
this
is
a
very
nice
version
of
the
style
i
have
only
sampled
this
delightful
beer
in
bottled
form
but
would
happily
lynch
any
philistine
of
a
stout
drinker
who
walked
straight
past
this
tap
and
made
for
the
guiness
instead
this
is
a
much
more
fluid
ale
with
a
sharp
dry
flavour
and
a
much
more
satisfying
aftertaste
this
would
be
my
favourite
stout
were
it
not
for
the
existence
of
orkneys
equally
impressive
dark
island
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
english
stout
it
poured
a
very
deep
black
with
a
nice
head
that
lasted
through
the
entire
glass
had
a
delicious
chocolate
like
smell
and
a
very
nice
chocolate
malt
flavor
i
thought
it
had
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
for
a
stout
i
find
some
to
be
too
flat
by
design
i
think
too
heavy
to
be
a
session
beer
if
you
are
having
2
or
3
this
will
work
well
while
i
didnt
have
it
with
food
i
got
the
feeling
that
it
would
complement
a
beef
or
lamb
stew
perfectly
clear
very
dark
ruby
color
with
visible
sediment
and
some
active
carbonation
a
decent
head
of
tight
foam
that
lasts
quite
well
and
laces
nicely
the
smell
is
dominated
by
pleasant
roasted
grains
with
complementary
notes
of
chocolate
and
especially
coffeeneither
of
which
is
overwhelming
those
scents
dissipate
rather
quickly
leaving
a
lighter
and
somewhat
sour
scent
the
first
observation
upon
tasting
this
stout
is
that
it
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
and
a
correspondingly
diluted
taste
crisp
at
the
start
then
some
roasted
notes
show
up
before
giving
way
to
a
vaguely
metallic
flavor
the
finish
is
the
most
pleasant
aspect
of
the
taste
ending
with
a
creamy
and
then
bitter
taste
goes
down
smoothly
but
neither
interesting
nor
tasty
enough
to
merit
another
bottle

very
good

taste
surprisingly
didnt
have
that
much
coffee

however
it
was
an
initial
sweet
taste
with
a
nice
slightly
dry

tart

mouthfeel
was
light
and

this
beers
a

the

character
coffee

are
very
pleasing

are

continue

hops
are
restrained

the
balance
seems
tilted
toward

acid

stands
out
in

midtasteits
a
little
distracting
and
misplaced
also
the
beer
seems
extraordinarily

overall
its
a
solidly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
brew
nice

make
a
great

stout

the

rather
liked
their

for

aromas
are
of
rich
roasted

caramelized
malts
and
a
hint
of
bittering
hops
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
and
the
aromas
were
a
good
indication
of
the
bittersweet
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
flavors
herein
i
served
this
at
room
temperature
in
a
tall
halfliter
glass
and
it
left
me
with
the
impression
that
it
was
a
more
fullbodied
brew
than
it
actually
is
very
tasty
and
inviting
something
to
warm
you
on
a
cold
winters
night
and
while
the
legend
on
the
bottle
notes
that
it
qualifies
as
a
vegan
product
im
an
omnivore
and
im
sitting
here
with
an
empty
fridge
with
this
stout
making
me
hunger
for
steak
and
kidney
pie
an
above
average
stout

in

a

spritzy
and

monotone
for
a
stout

though
its
resembles
an
irish
style
most
closely
generally
the
beer
was
quite
drinkable

it
left

dissatisfied

bottle

stout
that

with
tan
head
that
lasts
black
translucent
color
with
reddish
hues
when
held
to
light
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
grains
and
slight
chocolate
metallic
flavor
in
the
first
sips
then
roasted
in
the
middle
with
a
dry
finish
that
is
slightly
sour
the
metallic
flavor
is
harsh
and
really
detracts
from
the
taste
the
body
is
good
but
the
drinkability
due
to
the
off
flavor
is
not
so
high
a
very
fine
stout
that
is
quite
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
the
black
body
is
held
down
by
a
half
inch
of
tan
foam
light
lacing
from
the
residual
layer
the
nose
is
very
light
but
gives
a
sense
of
smokiness
the
flavor
is
lightly
chocolate
with
small
hints
of
coffee
a
smooth
feel
that
may
be
a
bit
too
thin
for
my
taste
quite
drinkable
due
to
the
smoothness
and
light
abv
pretty
nice
little
stout
smoky
nose
and
flavour
with
a
little
roast
and
then
some
chocolate
quite
subtle
with
a
crisp
slight
fizzy
mouthfeel
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
acidity
the
palate
is
a
touch
short
but
theres
some
nice
flavours
in
this
quite
bitterroasty
aswell
dry
lightly
chalky
finish
overall
id
like
it
a
bit
thicker
but
its
a
good
stout
deceptive
indeed
as
well
as
very
tasty
certainly
played
up
the
chipotle
spice
but
the
chocolate
is
revving
at
full
force
as
well
i
find
this
a
tasty
beer
but
couldnt
have
it
very
often
as
an
interesting
beer
it
really
captures
that
mayan
spiced
hot
chocolate
feel
with
a
really
satisfying
spiciness
to
it
smoky
earthy
and
bittersweet
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
overall
have
enjoyed
many
chocolate
stouts
before
and
would
say
this
one
is
average
if
not
slightly
above
very
good
strong
chocolate
aroma
but
chipotle
spice
take
over
on
the
palate
masking
other
potential
flavors

with

smell
is
a
big
chocolate
and
cocoa
powder
upfront
touch
of
peppery
spice
that
gives
a
bit
of
a
nostril
tingle
not
a
ton
going
on
but
certainly
delivers
on
being
a
chocolatechipotle
stout
taste
is
all
chocolate
initially
milk
chocolate
and
hershey

chipotle
is
subtle
initially
but
is
a
little
more
noticeable
as
it
warms
and
shows
up
in
the
finish
roast

a
touch

sweetness
from
all
that
chocolate
mediumlight

lightmedium

not
bad
to
have
once
in
a
while
but
not
something
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
still
quite
drinkable
o
i
like
it
the
smell
beats
its
other
qualities
by
far
though
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
black
under
minimal
creaminess
coating
the
surface
and
leaving
behind
strings
of

here
and
there
smell
is
immediately
chocolaty
followed
by
vanilla
and
a
little
pepper
flavor
follows
suit
with
an
increased
chili
pepper
note
though
it
never
gets
spicy
roasted
malt
cocoa
nuts
and
some
fruity
yeast
less
intensely
chocolaty
than
the
smell
closer
to
more
of
a
standard
stout
with
a
pepper
twist
medium
bodied
with
some
tingly
carbonation
and
lingering
bitterness
not
bad
really
digging
this
beer
its
not
exceptional
but
an
example
of
a
well
done
solid
as
promised
beer
the
nose
is
heavy
milk
chocolate
a
little
earthy
green
pepper
lots
of
lactose
and
roasted
malt
this
smells
amazing
the
flavor
is
similar
lots
of
chocolate
earthy
dryness
bitter
hops
and
just
a
bit
of
heat
the
heat
from
the
pepper
plays
well
with
the
chocolate
this
is
pretty
balanced
and
the
flavors
pair
well
really
enjoyable
finish
too
this
pitch
black
brew
with
a
small
tan
head
has
a
complex
and
interesting
aroma
you
can
smell
the
chocolate
and
chipotle
the
flavor
is
powerful
and
refreshing
but
this
is
not
a
style
of
beer
that
i
am
an
aficionado
of
if
chocolate
flavored
beer
is
a
must
then
this
is
a
must
if
you
are
feeling
adventurous
i
would
try
it
also
it
isnt
bad
in
fact
i
enjoyed
the
more
i
drank
of
it
go
figure
average
looking
pour
but
really
nice
fine
lace
lots
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
and
to
taste
charcoal
and
a
bit
of
smoke
nice
roastiness
bittersweet
the
chipolte
is
not
big
and
in
your
face
but
it
gives
the
beer
a
wonderfully
odd
note
that
is
quite
enjoyable
creamy
lingering
finish
and
a
tingle
from
the
pepper
as
you
go
along
fun
and
interesting
a
tasty
brew
but
basically
a
one
off
i
think
the
mayan
combines
a
youngs
reminiscent
brand
of
biscuity
vanillaladen
cadburylike
chocolate
with
a
restrained
and
pleasant
level
of
spice
while
i
imagine
a
little
cinnamon
or
coffee
could
enhance
the
depth
its
perfectly
serviceable
just
the
way
it
is
be
sure
to
circle
your
calendar
for
the
next
release
500ml
bottle
had
at
the
distillery
in
savannah
great
beer
solid
taste
and
consistency
overall
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
a
milk
chocolate
bar
tinged
with
chipotle
to
taste
like
great
flavour
a
bit
too
sweet
and
balance
leans
to
the
pepper
dont
expect
subtly
i
dig
the
chocolate
in
the
beginning
and
the
balanced
chili
flavours
but
it
became
insipid
and
dusty
too
fast
enjoy
overall
not
much
else
to
say
other
than
a
very
solid
milk
stout
with
the
added
chipotle
kick
worth
a
shot
o
highly
reccommended
especially
for
chocolate
lovers
o
really
a
very
good
authentic
take
on
mayanmexican
chocolate
in
a
beer
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
with
a
really
nice
but
subtle
presence
of
chipotle
peppers
definitely
one
i
would
grab
again
othe
taste
of
this
beer
is
rather
interesting
as
it
transitions
to
rich
flavors
of
dark
chocolate
to
spicy
flavors
of
chipotle
pours
nearly
pitch
black
except
for
a
deep
reddish
brown
tinge
when
held
up
to
the
lighta
half
finger
beige
colored
head
atop
milk
chocolate
notes
jump
out
in
the
nose
with
light
nuttinessalthough
i
dont
get
any
smoky
chipotle
the
aromas
really
stand
out
for
me
lightly
carbonated
wich
is
good
just
a
tad
thin
but
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
flavor
profile
in
any
way
mildly
sweet
chocolate
at
the
onset
of
the
palate
with
that
hint
of
nuttinessthe
chipotle
comes
in
the
finish
and
lingers
in
the
back
of
the
throat
nicely
what
a
cool
beer
from
a
new
to
my
area
yorkshire
breweri
will
be
trying
other
stuff
from
ilkley
in
the
future
rather
nice
ilkley
have
taken
a
challenging
style
and
made
a
good
fist
of
it
looks
the
part
while
the
aroma
is
deceptively
sweet
and
chocolateladen
the
flavour
is
a
superb
blend
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
chipotles
that
delivers
a
dark
spicy
twang
body
is
ok
but
could
stand
to
be
thicker
and
creamier
overall
this
is
a
treat
for
the
senses
if
you
like
chillies
and
chocolate
then
this
is
the
brew
for
you
think
light
porter
roastiness
and
belgian
yeast
easy
drinking
maybe
a
hint
of
tartness
comes
across
more
like
a
dubbel
or
bsda
than
a
stout
from
the
yeast
character
unremarkable
example
of
any
of
the
styles
at
any
rate
i
think
this
beer
is
certainly
a
good
beer
every
time
i
go
to
the
mystic
brewery
this
beer
is
always
brewed
the
best
it
has
a
nice
dark
look
to
it
with
a
bit
of
a
chocolate
taste
to
it
a
stout
that
is
just
right
as
far
as
alcohol
percentage
must
try
if
you
like
stout
beer
cheers
overall
tastes
like
a
dubbel
mixed
with
an
irish
stout
very
interesting
and
complex
combination
of
flavors
a
nice
and
complex
brew
that
i
will
pick
up
again
the
taste
also
brought
out
the
dark
coffee
notes
and
dark
malts
withe
dark
fruit
more
in
the
background
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
that
leads
to
a
dry
finish
i
found
it
to
be
quite
good
the
beer
pours
a
molasses
color
and
sits
in
the
glass
as
mahogany
brown
with
a
massive
head
of
light
khakicolored
bubbles
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
which
takes
its
time
in
dissipating
the
head
leaves
a
ringed
lacing
of
fat
soapy
bubbles
on
the
glass
in
body
the
beer
appears
too
dark
for
light
to
penetrate
it
though
it
did
seem
clean
as
the
beer
was
being
poured
that
being
said
the
folks
at
mystic
are
the
wizards
of
yeast
and
they
dont
filter
their
beers
so
im
willing
to
bet
there
are
a
few
floaties
hanging
out
in
this
beer
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
initially
like
a
metallic
pear
but
not
in
a
bad
way
as
you
shove
your
nose
in
this
beer
it
opens
up
into
soft
cocoa
scents
with
touches
of
earthy
espresso
and
dark
fruity
notes
the
smell
is
soft
and
subtle
on
the
nose
much
like
an
irish
dry
stout
is
but
this
smell
is
also
deeply
complex
and
interesting
with
yeast
esters
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
sweet
and
then
tart
and
then
slightly
bitter
with
roast
in
flavor
it
begins
like
a
classic
stout
with
dry
roasty
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
and
even
a
touch
of
coffee
but
this
is
then
blanketed
as
the
taste
moves
forward
and
yeast
esters
plunge
onto
the
tongue
to
suggest
funky
dark
fruit
flavors
with
a
slightly
metallic
twinge
pear
and
even
slight
peach
flavors
can
also
be
tasted
in
the
esters
the
beer
finishes
closer
to
a
dry
stout
with
bitter
roast
but
with
a
nice
tart
dark
fruit
kick
that
adds
complexity
to
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
fairly
soft
and
sweet
with
light
fruit
flavors
and
a
faint
reminder
of
dried
roast
malt
with
a
touch
of
smoke
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
fluffy
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
slight
pucker
from
the
acid
in
body
the
beer
feels
just
about
medium
and
after
the
beer
leaves
the
mouth
is
left
slightly
dry
but
puckering
overall
this
is
a
fantastically
bizarre
beer
its
not
an
irish
dry
stout
at
all
though
it
does
show
some
qualities
of
a
dry
stout
it
has
amazing
funky
esters
and
could
quite
well
be
the
start
of
a
new
style
a
new
england
dark
ale
or
a
suffolk
dark
ale
if
we
must
call
it
that
whatever
it
is
it
is
super
drinkable
and
tasty
with
amazing
and
flavorful
yeast
character
try
this
beer
it
is
bizarre
and
tasty
overall
interesting
beer
that
seems
to
border
on
a
belgian
strong
ale
glad
to
have
tried
it
thanks
again
franklinn
overall
an
acceptable
beer
its
not
bad
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
im
not
disappointed
at
all
still
a
tasty
beer
different
from
a
lot
of
beers
out
there
theres
a
lot
going
on
and
the
flavors
continue
to
get
stronger
as
it
warms
o
overall
an
interesting
beer
and
hybrid
of
styles
though
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
it
the
nose
was
nice
but
i
didnt
like
the
taste
considering
i
like
some
of
their
other
saisons
id
rather
grab
those
off
the
shelf
than
revisit
this
one
taste
is
chocolate
sweetness
to
start
light
fruitiness
in
the
center
and
closes
with
a
soft
bitterness
that
leaves
with
a
tart
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
interesting
brew
o
a
very
interesting
and
complex
brew
a
lot
going
on
here
between
the
malts
and
yeast
notes
and
deffinatly
a
more
carbonated
mouthfeel
then
i
am
used
to
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
would
deffinatly
drink
it
again
it
just
seems
to
grow
on
me
more
and
more
as
i
drink
it
o
a
very
good
brew
id
definitely
have
another
a
diverse
flavor
profile
with
a
lot
of
good
things
going
on
overall
there
are
excellent
flavors
in
this
brew
and
the
combination
of
ash
and
lovely
fruit
esters
was
delightful
however
the
flavors
ultimately
come
across
as
quite
light
and
airy
in
presence
fading
quickly
and
never
quite
reaching
a
decent
strength
even
at
their
zenith
giving
the
brew
a
watery
feel
and
the
high
levels
of
carbonation
add
a
strange
mouthfeel
and
quickly
fill
the
stomach
with
air
tone
down
the
bubbly
and
boost
the
amount
of
ingredients

a
few

mouthfeel
is
perfect
full

very

not

it
gets
a

its

unbelievably
smooth
the
whole

through
with
a
perfect

bute
at

end
overall
a
real
quality
beer
im
very
happy
to
have
tried
it
on
cask
tasty
brew
somewhere
between
a
stout
dubble
and
quad
overall
b
fun
if
you
can
find
the
right
time
to
drink
it
overall
a
very
interesting
complex
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
and
will
definitely
try
it
again
overall
i
really
dig
this
as
a
unique
style
and
look
forward
to
more
throughout
the
new
england
seasons
im
not
sure
its
listed
correctly
so
therefore
i
need
to
experience
this
in
all
three
seasons
me
thinks
it
will
work
well
in
spring
and
fall
o
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
darker
beers
so
this
appealed
to
me
the
belgian
dark
ale
stout
and
porter
mix
is
done
very
well
you
can
taste
and
smell
each
one
very
drinkable
beer
as
well
a
bit
too
carbonated
but
once
it
settles
it
is
a
winner
i
will
definitely
look
out
for
other
mystic
brews
interesting
beer
its
sort
of
middle
ground
between
english
stout
and
belgian
dubbel
a
nice
and
different
beer
from
a
ma
brewery
mostly
malty
of
the
darker
variety
some
nearburnt
toast
flavors
thin
bodied
with
higher
level
of
carbonation
the
swallow
has
an
element
of
alcohol
warmth
along
with
mild
hop
this
is
an
interesting
complex
beer
theres
a
lot
of
different
flavors
in
each
sip
that
work
in
harmony
together
no
one
flavor
dominates
o
first
taste
of
this
style
nothing
to
compare
it
to
not
bad
but
nothing
i
can
say
that
i
would
rush
out
for
again
the
roasty
notes
carry
over
to
the
taste
with
a
clear
dry
finish
light
in
body
for
a
stout
starts
off
sweet
in
the
manner
of
a
darker
english
mildstyle
beer
aged
in
cabernet
sauvignon
barrels
perhaps
seems
like
it
strikes
a
similar
flavor
profile
and
mouthfeel
to
some
of
the
things
ive
tried
from
austins
jester
king
but
in
a
stoutporter
hybrid
form
simply
wonderful
a
great
find
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
with
very
faint
brown
highlights
when
held
to
light
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
produces
a
head
that
fills
half
the
glass
no
matter
how
it
is
poured
smells
of
caramel
brown
sugar
roasted
grains
burnt
sugar
dark
fruits
yeasty
phenols
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
and
so
far
its
all
good
taste
is
dark
malts
chocolate
caramel
brown
sugar
raisins
prunes
plums
this
is
very
complex
lots
of
stuff
going
on
here
medium
to
thick
body
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
maybe
too
much
sweet
saisonesque
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
carbonation
might
be
a
touch
on
the
high
side
but
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
fantastic
i
would
say
this
is
more
of
a
belgian
strong
dark
than
a
stout
but
when
a
beer
is
done
this
well
who
needs
labels
really
this
beer
is
starting
to
grow
on
my
love
the
trihybrid
style
going
on
here
stout
porter
with
a
belgian
flare
a
lot
of
flavor
to
take
in
here
a
clear
sipper
as
it
ends
up
being
super
complex
i
definitely
will
be
revisiting
this
beer
future
batches
completely
opaque
black
as
black
can
be
no
light
can
be
seen
though
any
part
of
the
body
creamy
tan
head
that
holds
up
nicely
impeccable
head
retention
and
lacing
really
nice
looking
smell
is
kind
of
off
putting
i
can
pick
up
on
some
dark
malts
and
light
belgian
yeast
almost
has
a
wine
character
to
the
smell
roasted
barley
really
pulls
through
on
the
sip
much
thicker
than
i
expected
which
is
relieving
tastes
like
a
stout
just
belgiany
nice
malty
aftertaste
molasses
is
mild
competing
against
the
malt
bill
pretty
interesting
beer
oak
in
hitting
the
end
of
the
sip
bitterness
in
pleasant
and
suiting
i
like
it
more
as
i
sip
on
but
this
has
some
odd
conflicting
flavors
in
my
humble
opinion
interesting
concept
excellent
presentation
look
forward
to
more
future
beer
from
mystic
o
nice
beer
here
a
combination
of
nice
flavors
but
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
slightly
over
carbonated
i
felt
but
not
a
bad
beer
its
good
not
as
good
as
their
saison
but
one
i
enjoyed
i
wouldnt
be
opposed
to
trying
subsequent
batches
of
this
beer
as
it
has
underlying
potential
that
it
seems
to
fail
to
cash
in
on
o
very
malty
complex
satisfying
beer
that
is
somewhere
between
a
belgian
dubbel
and
roasty
porter
overall
really
interesting
nice
dark
malts
and
molasses
light
saison
flavors
drinkable
despite
the
booze
very
interesting
and
tasty
o
a
very
interesting
idea
but
the
execution
fell
flat
unfortunately
it
tastes
like
a
really
thin
porter
basically
some
mild
belgian
influence
but
nothing
really
stands
out
the
watery
aspect
really
lowered
the
scores
too
unfortunately
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
just
do
not
match
up
with
the
looks
and
aroma
o
i
enjoyed
the
take
on
this
beer
i
think
the
recipe
needs
to
be
dialed
down
and
tweaked
a
bit
either
go
bigger
with
more
body
or
tone
down
the
abv
and
make
this
sessionable
lots
of
potential
and
worth
picking
up
and
trying
my
scores
slightly
reflect
the
style
classification
but
this
beer
doesnt
and
cant
fit
into
any
category
o
i
liked
it
not
as
nice
as
the
saison
but
the
yeasty
tartness
roasty
flavor
coupled
with
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
make
it
nicely
enjoyable
o
i
remember
liking
this
alot
more
at
the
tasting
i
was
at
its
still
a
nice
beer
just
not
up
to
par
with
their
saison
this
is
a
unique
brew
its
a
bit
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
without
the
strong
and
less
of
the
belgian
its
certainly
got
easy
drinking
porter
qualities
i
get
what
they
were
going
for
and
i
respect
the
endeavor
i
picked
up
a
bottle
of
this
today
at
bermans
in
lexington
not
really
sure
that
this
beer
fits
in
to
any
specific
style
category
but
lets
give
it
a
go
and
see
what
happens
the
color
is
quite
dark
but
just
a
shade
or
two
away
from
being
black
a
nice
pillow
like
white
heading
perks
up
right
away
some
roast
comes
through
in
the
beginning
of
the
smell
along
with
some
yeasty
tones
chocolate
cola
and
brown
bread
lots
of
stone
fruit
comes
through
in
the
flavor
initially
with
the
molasses
ending
things
on
a
sweet
yet
somewhat
spiced
note
there
are
some
robust
notes
to
it
that
are
found
in
some
dubbels
that
i
am
not
crazy
about
but
the
yeast
they
are
using
here
is
really
alive
and
in
your
face
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
and
certainly
plenty
going
on
complexity
wise
i
must
say
that
i
was
not
as
taken
as
some
others
were
with
their
saison
but
this
one
really
delivered
for
me
it
is
very
reminiscent
of
brooklyn
local
2
if
you
ask
me
either
way
this
one
gets
two
big
thumbs
up
from
me
cheers
odi
love
their
saison
i
think
it
may
be
my
favorite
saison
but
this
one
does
not
impress
me
at
all
the
nose
is
off
putting
the
flavor
is
strange
the
feel
doesnt
match
the
style
well
just
not
very
good
at
8
50
a
bottle
i
will
finish
it
however
i
wish
i
had
waited
for
someone
to
tell
me
about
this
before
i
tossed
out
nearly
10
for
this
one
o
conceptually
this
is
very
interesting
a
hybrid
english
porterirish
dry
stout
fermented
with
a
saison
yeast
with
molasses
too
great
idea
excellent
execution
darker
brown
pour
with
a
small
cap
of
tan
head
that
mostly
dissipated
spotty
lacing
basic
roasty
malt
aroma
and
not
much
else
in
the
taste
dark
malts
coffee
roastiness
yeasty
esters
grains
earthy
hops
not
too
bad
but
nothing
really
interesting
going
on
body
was
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
but
english
stouts
can
swing
that
way
not
undrinkable
pours
a
near
black
with
a
small
foamy
offwhite
head
the
most
noteworthy
aspect
of
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
roasted
barley
chocolate
and
caramel
its
slightly
bitter
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
otherwise
a
pretty
smooth
stout
to
drink
along
with
a
burger
or
steak
sandwich
which
both
by
the
way
are
great
at
this
brewpub
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
only
complaint
is
perhaps
a
slight
watery
taste
to
it
just
didnt
leave
me
with
that
sense
of
wow
what
a
great
fresh
beer
that
you
get
at
the
best
of
breweries
pours
nearly
black
maybe
some
deep
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
doesnt
really
have
much
of
a
head
so
then
it
gets
little
lacing
smell
and
taste
are
pretty
good
though
on
the
sweet
side
with
toffee
but
has
a
nice
roast
component
medium
body
low
carbonation
smooth
finish
slightly
bitter
coffeeroast
finish
paired
well
with
the
pulled
pork
sandwich
i
got
at
the
brewpub
i
like
this
creamy
full
mouthfeel
that
is
highly
quaffable
look
forward
to
returning
to
n
virginia
to
procure
more
of
this
o
come
on
haters
give
it
up
for
blue
gray
here
ive
always
dug
this
one
its
cheap
readily
available
and
done
by
a
brewery
that
i
have
the
utmost
rest
for
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
english
style
stout
lots
of
roasted
and
coffee
notes
with
some
hops
coming
through
in
the
taste
worth
checking
out
o
would
like
this
if
it
had
more
body
o
not
bad
but
bitter
flavor
would
push
me
to
pick
something
else
fairly
easy
drinker
on
a
cold
night
light
body
helps
with
that
and
the
tastes
combine
for
a
pretty
nice
overall
effect
d
i
think
this
bottle
has
turned
if
i
had
a
chance
to
get
another
one
of
these
id
like
to
try
it
just
so
i
would
know
whether
or
not
what
i
have
now
is
infected
not
what
i
want
in
a
stout
not
something
to
jump
up
and
down
about
in
celebration
but
a
very
drinkable
stout
nonetheless
thanks
to
jeff
and
his
wife
for
all
the
great
beers
hope
to
get
back
there
soon
and
taste
all
the
good
vittles
at
the
new
resteraunt
pours
an
opaque
jet
black
with
about
a
finger
of
bubbly
tan
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
of
burnt
and
roasted
dark
malts
wheat
oatmeal
and
biscuit
the
taste
favors
the
roasted
malts
burns
the
biscuit
and
adds
in
a
small
bite
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
body
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
has
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
does
not
malignantly
cover
the
tongue
instead
smoothly
though
somewhat
chalkily
rolling
through
overall
a
pretty
average
stout
but
pretty
drinkable
nonetheless
poured
a
black
body
with
a
onefinger
tan
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
a
good
roastedcoffee
malt
smell
that
is
mixed
evenly
with
hints
of
sweetness
like
chocolate
and
caramel
a
lightbodied
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
stout
that
is
mellow
caramel
bitterdark
chocolate
and
some
toffee
maybe
even
butterscotch
bc
this
beer
is
slightly
buttery
that
is
complemented
but
not
balanced
with
roasted
and
coffee
malts
this
gives
the
beer
an
easy
to
drink
quality
that
passes
sweetly
and
then
finishes
dry
although
the
dry
maltsbeer
have
this
funky
sour
fruit
quality
it
is
almost
like
they
used
cherry
flavored
coffee
beans
or
something
like
a
french
coffee
it
is
really
odd
and
i
am
wondering
if
i
got
a
really
oldbad
bottle
this
little
quirck
makes
the
beer
s
little
less
enjoyable
and
the
bomber
i
had
is
enough
d
drinkability
is
just
about
average
every
aspect
of
this
brew
comes
together
to
make
a
mediocre
to
above
average
experience
the
aroma
could
be
bumped
up
a
little
flavor
seems
a
tad
off
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
stonewall
stout
is
my
first
experience
with
blue
gray
brewing
co
im
not
overly
impressed
but
this
is
far
from
a
bad
beer
if
the
souracidic
aspect
could
be
knocked
out
itd
be
better
how
much
is
hard
to
say
but
its
a
minor
annoyance
for
me
all
in
all
its
above
average
definitely
not
a
bad
option
especially
if
youre
looking
for
an
english
stout
to
check
off
your
list
d
very
drinkable
all
the
flavors
blend
well
and
it
just
feels
good
going
down
overall
a
fine
stout
that
is
well
balanced
delicious
and
satisfying
from
every
angle
notes
from
11405
plenty
of
bitter
roated
malts
great
for
the
cold
winter
months
recommended
taste
is
smooth
in
the
mouth
chocolate
laced
with
smoke
if
that
makes
any
sense
wow
a
bitter
twinge
tickles
the
back
of
both
sides
aof
the
tongue
in
the
end
bomber
from
ricks
in
alexandria
a
nice
dark
stout
the
finish
was
a
little
dry
and
had
some
bitterness
but
was
enjoyable
this
is
a
nice
warmer
and
worth
a
try
d
highly
drinkable
flavors
are
very
balanced
pretty
good
stout
not
as
big
as
what
i
am
used
to
but
i
cant
think
of
too
many
english
stouts
i
have
had
if
the
nose
were
a
bit
less
of
sour
grape
allowing
more
smokiness
and
maltiness
to
come
through
i
think
it
would
hit
the
style
even
better
but
it
still
is
a
nice
stout
d
overall
a
very
drinkable
stout
not
as
heavy
as
some
so
it
it
more
quaffable
this
is
a
very
good
stout
from
a
good
little
brewery
blue
and
gray
deep
brown
pour
almost
black
some
light
shines
through
head
goes
away
quickly
smell
is
roasted
slighty
burnt
coffee
some
faint
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
for
a
stout
but
it
is
an
english
stout
this
actually
stands
to
make
the
pretty
drinkable
for
a
stout
of
any
kind
drinkability
made
fresh
to
be
drinkin
fresh
and
you
can
tell
has
a
clean
taste
to
it
hard
to
describe
but
its
like
spring
water
was
used
here
no
preservatives
here
hope
to
try
some
more
from
this
place
when
i
get
my
hands
on
it
d
i
am
very
glad
that
we
opened
the
bottle
now
it
held
enough
flavor
to
make
it
worthwhile
but
not
enough
to
make
it
a
musthave
this
was
one
of
my
favorites
from
blue
gray
and
it
poured
dark
with
a
small
tan
head
aromas
of
chocolate
coffee
etc
what
youd
expect
of
most
stouts
but
this
one
has
a
very
clean
finish
and
high
drinkability
while
retaining
good
flavor
i
hung
out
on
the
porch
and
put
back
a
couple
22s
of
these
easily
the
funny
old
guy
at
the
brewery
was
in
love
with
this
stout
as
well
definitely
pick
some
up
if
youre
around
fredericksburg
d
i
prefer
the
taste
of
this
to
many
other
stouts
because
it
has
a
lighter
body
than
others
it
finishes
strong
and
is
very
drinkable
the
slight
hops
in
the
aftertaste
mixed
with
the
dark
chocolate
flavor
is
a
wonderful
combination
pick
up
this
gem
if
in
southern
virginia
drinkabilitynotes
stonewall
stout
is
very
drinkable
a
very
nice
stout
that
is
full
of
roasted
coffee
and
semisweet
chocolate
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
and
one
that
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
i
could
see
downing
a
bunch
of
these
thankfully
i
purchased
a
few
bottles
like
blue
and
grays
pale
ale
stonewall
stout
was
actually
better
on
tap
if
you
have
the
opportunity
pick
up
a
few
bottles
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
i
very
good
stout
that
i
will
buy
again
definitely
recommended
seek
and
enjoy
you
will
not
be
disappointed
obsidian

1
inch

and
lots
of
stickiness
head
falls
to
a
table
and
solid
ring
smell
is
toasted
malt
not
strong
and
lightly
bitter
hops
the
taste
is
malt
driven
ashy
toasted
bitterness
nice
long
finish
but
the
body
was
too
light
a
little
more
creaminess
and
this
is
a
great
stout
as
it
is
the
beer
is
reminiscent
of
a
mass
produced
irish
stout
very
drinkable
with
an
abv
of
5
this
is
a
nice
alternative
had
this
on
easter
with
lamb
and
vegetable
kabobs
decent
pairing
in
all
fairness
i
probably
sat
on
this
one
too
long
and
should
revisit
it
at
some
point
oelergud
i
was
initially
excited
by
the
raspberry
smell
opening
the
bottle
but
it
ended
up
being
much
drier
than
i
anticipated
i
expect
this
is
due
to
the
lower
original
gravity
and
all
the
sugar
in
the
constituent
ingredients
was
metabolized
by
the
yeast
making
this
a
milk
stout
would
probably
help
overall
too
bitter
not
a
huge
fan
wouldnt
have
another
o
tough
to
choke
down
a
few
ounces
of
this
blue
gray
continues
to
impress
me
their
chocolate
raspberry
stout
is
something
different
and
quite
tasty
d
this
is
not
one
id
have
every
day
but
since
my
wife
dug
it
that
definitely
counts
for
something
d
an
ok
stout
but
nothing
special
i
thought
the
taste
was
a
bit
watered
down
worth
trying
but
wouldnt
seek
out
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
slightly
below
average
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
its
not
a
big
roasty
stout
for
sure
but
its
a
pretty
decent
raspberry
flavored
beer
its
a
nice
seasonal
for
valentines
day
though
and
fits
the
season
well
very
dark
brown
color
milk
chocolate
like
in
appearance
with
a
thin
tan
head
with
a
surprising
amount
of
lacing
berries
and
chocolate
malt
on
the
nose
taste
is
sadly
lacking
any
of
the
berry
from
the
nose
instead
a
strong
roasted
malt
body
and
cocoa
powderlike
sweetness
resulting
in
a
milk
chocolate
like
syrupy
body
not
awful
but
not
great
reminds
me
of
the
legend
chocolate
porter
i
just
had
not
quite
as
bad
as
that
but
still
a
let
down
the
pour
reveals
a
dark
nearly
opaque
brown
with
a
whispy
tan
foam
for
a
head
for
a
stout
it
looks
a
little
thin
especially
when
viewed
from
above
theres
some
lacing
but
its
thin
and
transitory
the
raspberries
come
out
in
the
smell
along
with
a
train
of
dark
chocolatey
malts
the
taste
though
takes
the
raspberries
mostly
out
of
the
equation
leading
instead
with
the
malts
which
give
a
chocodust
flavor
a
twinge
of
bitterness
and
near
the
back
there
comes
a
hint
of
those
very
berries
from
the
smell
though
it
definitely
defies
its
own
appearance
by
sitting
just
a
tad
heavy
on
the
tongue
its
not
too
heavy
to
keep
the
drinkability
down
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothin
too
special
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
sweet
with
artificial
fruit
and
bit
like
a
raspberry
sherbert
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
thin
mocha
tan
head
very
little
retention
and
just
a
touch
of
lacing
smells
of
raspberries
brownie
batter
brown
sugar
butter
and
lightly
roasted
malts
tastes
of
raspberries
and
other
dark
fruits
like
prunes
up
front
then
some
brownies
butter
caramel
and
a
touch
of
coffee
medium
light
in
body
with
low
carbonation
smooth
but
thin
with
lots
of
fruit
sweetness
that
covers
up
a
good
amount
of
the
stout
characteristics
nice
for
something
like
valentines
day
or
to
enjoy
while
eating
some
chocolate
but
a
little
too
sweet
and
artificial
tasting
to
really
want
to
enjoy
frequently
it
was
a
struggle
to
even
finishing
off
1
pint
poured
a
dark
black
color
with
a
smaller
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
raspberries
chocolate
and
i
was
getting
some
soapiness
and
perfume
tastes
of
raspberries
and
chocolate
i
wasnt
crazy
about
that
aroma
as
that
perfumesoapiness
was
kinda
nasty
this
isnt
bad
but
its
pretty
one
dimensional
if
there
were
more
malt
flavor
especially
chocolate
but
roasted
as
well
it
would
really
be
pretty
special
not
too
shabby
nonetheless
im
a
fan
of
raspberry
mixed
with
chocolate
this
one
does
a
pretty
good
job
and
almost
tastes
like
something
you
would
find
in
the
snack
aisle
of
a
grocery
store
recommended
drinkability
another
fresh
and
solid
offering
from
blue
gray
glad
i
picked
one
up
and
ill
continue
to
probably
get
all
the
bombers
i
can
find
and
review
them
as
theyre
purchased
as
ive
been
impressed
so
far
again
you
cant
beat
the
local
breweries
especially
those
who
consistently
are
making
quality
brews
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
aquired
in
a
trade
would
try
it
again
but
i
was
thinking
it
was
going
to
offer
more
then
what
it
did
served
a
nice
opaque
black
with
a
diminishing
head
the
aroma
was
of
some
raspberries
but
a
little
weak
the
beer
was
a
great
balance
of
everything
promised
chocolate
and
raspberries
played
very
well
with
the
taste
of
roasted
barley
there
was
a
nice
dryness
to
it
the
beer
was
light
and
smooth
this
would
make
a
good
session
stout
on
a
cold
winter
night
purchased
far
too
long
ago
for
less
than
6
for
a
750ml
bottle
directly
from
the
brewery
which
is
the
only
way
i
know
how
to
obtain
this
stuff
oelergud
this
is
a
very
bad
example
of
a
barrel
aged
beer
flavors
are
muted
under
lageresque
type
corniness
in
the
beer
not
sure
what
it
is
but
another
poor
example
of
beer
making
by
lost
rhino
i
should
have
known
not
to
even
give
this
a
try
due
to
the
dust
covered
bottles
on
the
shelf
when
i
bought
this
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
boarding
on
very
good
great
flavors
of
malt
and
some
coffee
and
sweetness
the
only
hang
up
i
have
and
its
not
really
a
hang
up
but
a
comment
is
that
the
beer
is
labeled
as
a
barrelaged
stout
bourbon
barrelaged
actually
but
i
dont
get
much
bourbon
flavors
or
any
wood
still
its
a
very
good
stout
and
had
it
not
been
labeled
as
a
bourbon
barrelaged
stout
which
makes
the
drinker
anticipate
certain
flavors
that
this
beer
lacks
i
would
have
rated
it
much
higher
than
i
have
i
did
have
one
batch
were
it
was
very
hoppy
the
second
was
far
less
maybe
it
was
really
fresh
either
way
defiantly
worth
a
try
served
in
a
snifter
from
a
22
oz
bottle
very
nice
balance
of
the
woody
bourbon
barrel
aged
flavor
had
on
tap
before
at
the
brewery
and
just
as
good
that
is
all
o
i
enjoy
the
bourbon
barrel
aging
but
it
can
easily
be
overdone
and
overwhelm
the
beer
flavors
some
ive
had
taste
like
someone
just
poured
a
shot
into
a
stout
this
beer
seemed
to
have
about
the
right
amount
of
aging
flavor
the
barrel
aging
dominated
but
wasnt
too
much
draft
pour
at
mekong
dark
black
mahogany
color
very
little
head
so
wondering
how
old
the
keg
is
smell
roasted
coffee
and
oak
with
a
hint
of
tennessee
whiskey
tastes
of
chocolate
with
coffee
and
i
want
to
say
rye
lightly
oily
in
the
mouth
goes
down
smooth
but
has
an
odd
after
taste
you
get
a
wash
back
of
coffee
and
roasted
malts
buried
under
slight
whiskey
i
dont
taste
a
strong
abv
here
mild
for
stout
but
it
is
an
english
stout
russians
make
it
almost
burn
im
not
a
fan
of
the
after
taste
i
think
they
used
whiskey
barrels
instead
of
bourbon
barrels
i
prefer
bourbon
d
this
was
not
very
strong
on
the
bourbon
but
it
had
lots
of
oak
character
a
tasty
stout
with
very
nice
body
and
well
hidden
alcohol
smooth
finish
so
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
maybe
best
fresh
but
it
could
probably
age
too
recommended
pours
near
black
with
a
dark
tan
thick
head
that
produces
ample
lacing
flavor
and
nose
are
both
a
little
too
one
note
relying
too
heavily
on
bourbon
but
given
the
abv
this
is
never
overly
boozy
some
roast
malt
molasses
and
brown
sugar
from
the
base
stout
hide
behind
the
bourbon
but
this
is
mostly
vanilla
and
barrel
heavy
body
is
medium
thin
with
light
carbonation
and
a
silky
finish
needs
some
work
but
recommended
if
you
see
this
on
draft
lighter
body
with
soft
cask
carbonation
only
a
slight
bit
of
heat
not
a
huge
stout
but
the
oak
and
bourbon
lend
a
nice
touch
overall
pretty
good
and
solid
for
a
first
barrelaged
attempt
the
bourbon
just
came
through
too
much
perhaps
blending
some
of
the
base
beer
back
in
would
have
balanced
things
out
a
bit
has
all
the
makings
of
a
great
bourbon
barrel
stout
just
a
little
more
watered
down
than
i
would
like
sweet
malty
everpresent
vanilla
delicious
this
sort
of
beer
could
form
a
fantastic
foundation
for
variants
coffee
nibs
perhaps
congrats
to
lost
rhino
for
creating
a
wonderful
product
o
i
have
no
idea
why
there
arent
more
positive
reviews
of
this
beer
its
a
delicious
bourbonbarrel
aged
stout
with
all
the
character
of
an
bbaged
imperial
stout
but
with
the
abv
of
a
regular
stout
winwin
overall
a
worth
example
of
the
style
o
very
solid
stout
great
english
stout
subtle
hints
of
coffee
balanced
nicely
with
roasted
barely
helltown
makes
some
nice
stuff
id
recommend
checking
them
out
if
you
havent
this
beer
is
similar
to
a
breakfast
stout
but
without
a
super
high
abv
overall
a
nice
drinkable
stout
its
not
mind
blowing
but
definitely
meets
the
expectations
a
fairly
thick
stout
with
powdery
cocoa
tones
showing
more
than
anything
else
not
as
cohesive
or
as
thick
as
i
was
expecting
its
consistent
sure
feel
is
pretty
smooth
minimal
nip
of
carbonation
pretty
decent
somewhat
thick
flavor
on
things
but
not
overly
interesting
a
nice
production
but
i
prefer
and
like
helltowns
other
productions
much
better
nice
hope
they
keep
brewing
this
one
overall
as
i
expected
a
fantastic
stout
more

come
across

tastes
very

maybe

a
beer
to
be
savoured
till
the

silky

unconventional
stout
drinkable
too
i
get
the
fuss
over
magic

overall
an
okay
beer
a

over

overall
a

shame
its
so

it
would
make

overall
a
very

stout
if
maybe
a
little
rough
round

edges
another
fine
brew
from

though

definitely
recommended
good
body
on

and
good

a

tasty
and
drinkable
session
beer
d
overall
acceptable
but
not
stellar
not
as
sweet
as
i
would
expect
this
kind
of
stout
to
be
when
i
asked
the
guy
pouring
it
he
said
it
was
just
a
normal
dry
stout
for
that
particular
description
this
is
bang
on
on
tap
at
smokeless
joes
tapped
a
deep
cola
pour
accompanied
by
a
frothy
mocha
cap
some
lace
sticks
to
the
glass
nose
of
dark
fruit
cola
some
dark
chocolate
subtle
black
coffee
tastes
of
dark
chocolate
black
coffee
a
bit
fruity
too
light
bitterness
balances
out
the
mild
fruity
sweetness
pretty
good
stuff
had
it
on
tap
last
night
at
volo
in
toronto
showed
up
on
the
table
looking
rich
and
creamy
very
dark
and
stouty
with
a
hint
of
red
highlight
great
mouth
feel
nice
and
smooth
with
great
sweet
malty
taste
not
as
bitter
on
the
end
as
some
stouts
which
is
a
nice
changed
very
drinkable
kind
of
rich
feeling
smelled
like
sweeter
than
some
stouts
ive
had
would
recomend
this
to
people
who
arent
huge
fans
of
guiness
but
want
to
try
other
stouts
i
tried
this
beer
on
january
28
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
the
beer
was
dark
brownblack
in
the
glass
with
a
thin
creamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
was
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
raisin
the
mouthfeel
was
fullbodied
creamy
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
roasted
malt
a
little
coffee
and
a
little
licorice
cask
conditioned
at
volo
very
dark
body
with
a
small
beige
head
which
leaves
really
impressive
lacing
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
seems
to
defy
physics
caramel
in
the
aroma
with
toasted
notes
cocoa
coffee
and
vanilla
are
mixed
in
with
the
roasted
malts
nicely
moderately
bitter
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
drinkability
is
good
well
balanced
this
is
one
id
happily
try
again
and
would
love
to
see
generally
available
d
below
average
a
chalky
black
body
shades
of
grey
actually
some
spotty
head
aroma
full
of
inticement
notes
of
dark
malts
a
strong
roast
presence
hints
of
dark
tobacco
and
all
wrapped
between
a
sutty
fireplace
like
smokyness
the
body
is
considerably
creamy
a
little
flat
and
warm
as
result
of
the
cask
well
suited
for
the
beer
flavours
again
of
hefty
dark
malts
light
degree
of
roast
plenty
of
appeal
this
is
always
a
great
stout
an
absolute
pleasure
to
have
off
cask
overall
a
wonderful
beer
in
a
style
thats
not
common
around
here
and
i
wish
it
were
more
prevalent
around
town
on
cask
at
volo
pours
black
with
some
red
highlights
on
the
edges
medium
sized
thick
tan
head
forms
lots
of
sticky
lace
good
retention
right
down
to
the
last
drop
smell
is
sweet
cherries
roast
chocolatecoffee
excellent
taste
is
sweet
cherries
dry
roasty
middle
with
plenty
of
chocolate
and
coffee
little
bit
of
caramel
lots
of
fruits
and
some
citrus
in
the
finish
nice
roasty
bitterness
going
down
mouthful
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
very
creamy
and
smooth
treat
to
find
ill
always
take
a
pint
cask
is
much
better
than
nitro
for
this
one
nose
is
earthy
full
of
chocolate
and
some
coffee
taste
is
dominated
by
chocolate
nice
and
creamy
smooth
on
the
palate
wonderful
pint
to
drink
earthiness
here
too
but
it
added
to
the
character
of
the
beer
to
my
mind
overall
nicely
put
together
and
well
worth
a
try
transparent
ruby
nice
eyes
of
lace
peering
back
at
me
another
dull
aroma
beer
from
d
c
slight
earthiness
shows
in
both
nose
and
taste

i
hate
to
use
this
but
since
im
a
gardener
ill
have
to
throw
it
out
there

bat
guano
earthy
rustic
chalky
flavors
repulse
the
tongue
cola
flavors
throughout
roasty
bitterness
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
come
through
at
the
last
possible
moment
to
save
this
from
being
a
major
disaster
too
thin
mouthfeel
earthy
smells
along
with
nonremarkable
flavors
make
the
5
pint
seem
absolutely
worthless
poured
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
light
seeping
through
light
tan
head
not
much
retention
or
lacing
sweet
chocolatey
aroma
with
hints
of
hops
butterscotch
and
a
slight
roasted
flavour
taste
was
well
balanced
with
some
roasted
flavours
chocolate
toffee
contrasted
by
the
hops
and
moderate
bitterness
a
tad
sour
after
each
sip
body
was
a
bit
light
for
a
stout
but
extremely
drinkable
quite
the
delicious
stout
pours
black
with
a
dark
orangeyred
hue
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
which
leaves
bubbles
down
the
glass
buttery
nose
with
the
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
very
nice
balance
between
a
sweet
butterscotch
diacetyl
and
the
roasted
malts
quite
a
nice
balance
sweet
but
not
overpoweringly
so
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
from
the
cask
conditioning
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
stout
pours
or
rather
pumps
and
strong
black
with
a
hint
red
in
the
light
head
is
tan
big
and
foamy
with
much
lacing
aroma
of
strong
roasted
malt
and
coffee
the
taste
was
a
very
creamy
robust
roasted
malt
with
coffee
notes
and
very
pure
taste
like
a
mountain
lake
the
mouthfeel
was
light
yet
full
and
went
down
very
easily
i
could
drink
this
all
night
and
i
probably
will
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
specatuclar
with
lots
of
creamyness
and
that
characteristic
watery
cask
beer
feel
its
hard
to
explain
but
its
a
good
thing
indeed
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
a
unique
stout
treat
for
me
again
21
months
later
cask
conditioned
at
volos
and
nice
coffee
aroma
smooth
and
dry
this
had
a
very
thick
and
creamy
light
brown
head
that
easily
lasted
throughout
the
beer
and
formed
thick
lace
on
the
glass
the
beer
itself
was
nearly
black
with
ruby
highlights
visible
at
the
edge
of
the
glass
maltiness
and
roasted
barley
dominated
the
aroma
with
a
light
hoppiness
evident
bitter
to
start
followed
by
sweet
chocolate
and
light
roasted
flavours
a
mild
bitterness
followed
through
into
the
finish
astringency
was
well
controlled
medium
full
body
with
a
silky
smooth
texture
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
the
taste
will
surely
please
anyone
that
craves
big
chocolate
mocha
like
malts
and
some
nice
flavoring
hops
not
altogether
bitter
either
which
was
nice
and
lends
to
the
quaffability
factor
wow
i
am
impressed
with
the
finish
as
well
very
smooth
and
dry
again
with
minimal
bitterness
seek
it
out
if
you
can
find
it
very
much
recommended
by
the
way
cheers
to
smokeless
joe
for
all
the
amazing
beers
wow
o
will
not
buy
again
o
a
mild
easydrinking
highly
sessionable
brew
given
its
low
abv
it
might
better
be
called
a
porter
again
a
dark
sweet
malty
taste
character
at
first
with
a
mildly
dry
and
clean
finish
it
was
easy
to
drink
but
very
much
like
guinness
stout
overall
the
stout
lacks
depth
and
breadth
too
crisp
a
texture
not
satisfying
in
the
least
a
very
good
taste
and
smoothness
overall
this
was
marketed
as
a
black
and
tan
case
and
as
a
black
and
tan
ingredient
this
stout
fairs
well
with
a
mild
smokey
taste
and
a
smooth
feel
its
not
quite
as
good
as
a
sam
smiths
stout
but
very
good
indeed
o
could
use
a
little
more
ass
to
the
actual
stout
flavor
but
by
no
means
an
awful
beer
a
simple
basic
stout
could
be
roastier
and
is
rather
thin
it
came
in
a
6pack
with
three
of
this
and
three
pale
ale
with
directions
on
how
to
make
a
black
and
tan
on
its
own
its
decent
enough
though
nothing
special
overall
a
mild
and
simple
but
acceptable
stout
that
is
a
bit
weak
on
flavor
overall
i
like
it
it
is
definitely
watery
and
not
very
complex
but
the
style
really
isnt
supposed
to
be
overly
complex
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
alternative
to
someone
who
wants
to
drink
a
stout
that
doesnt
taste
like
guinness
coming
from
an
area
where
guinness
is
one
of
the
only
craft
beers
offered
at
the
bars
im
going
to
have
to
say
its
about
a
3
5
out
of
5
would
i
seek
this
out
well
it
matters
what
the
alternatives
were
at
the
time
really
i
wouldnt
shun
it
in
the
least
taste
is
mainly
roasted
grain
not
very
malty
nor
does
it
have
any
real
burnt
taste
the
body
is
totally
watery
in
a
refreshing
sort
of
way
this
is
more
in
the
abv
range
of
an
actual
englishstyle
beer
so
the
lack
of
maltiness
is
appropriate
still
its
not
totally
dry
still
its
a
different
sort
of
stout
faint
hoppiness
and
not
as
bitter
as
the
black
stouts
think
of
it
as
a
dark
lager
and
it
goes
down
easier
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
ralphs
supermarket
in
san
clemente
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
slight
char
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cookie
dough
and
slight
metallic
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
a
bit
watery
flavorwise
but
not
too
shabby
rjt
o
this
is
okay
it
worked
well
as
a
black
tan
mix
nothing
to
write
home
about
if
you
want
to
to
enjoy
it
they
sell
this
beer
with
the
pale
ale
and
it
called
black
and
tan
pub
kit
they
want
you
to
mixed
both
beers
together
and
if
you
do
its
just
right
half
of
each
it
taste
mighty
other
wise
skip
this
beer
nitro
tap
beers
are
horrible
this
feels
bad
in
the
mouth
and
has
little
flavor
to
speak
of
this
is
bad
beer
figured
id
try
out
the
stout
by
itself
before
i
attempted
a
proper
black
and
tan
this
stuff
pours
a
bleak
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
roasted
malts
and
a
bit
of
light
coffee
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
dab
of
that
guinnesslike
sourness
in
the
background
unfortunately
here
it
comes
across
kinda
like
burnt
sourdough
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
decent
stout
but
one
that
seems
to
necessitate
the
black
and
tan
in
order
to
really
be
enjoyed
as
its
verging
on
blandness
o
this
has
all
the
right
components
but
tastes
a
bit
watered
down
definitely
sessionable
and
by
no
means
bad
though
overall
a
very
nice
stout
good
as
seasonal
and
with
food
too
to
revisit
overall
impression
not
impressed
weak
flavors
almost
not
residual
taste
not
a
great
product
o
a
very
well
balanced
and
respectable
stout
there
are
better
stouts
of
this
style
out
there
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
a
lot
worse
would
go
back
for
another
a
queer
brew
indeed
but
enjoyable
overall
a
little
too
ashy
and
thin
for
my
taste
of
stouts
yes
this
is
a
great
allaround
stout
rich
and
robust
without
clobbering
you
with
excessive
alcohol
in
the
abv
very
good
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
an
english
stout
this
one
is
pretty
darn
good
it
is
balanced
dry
and
drinkable
still
i
dont
know
if
this
tastes
like
a
100yearold
recipe
like
the
label
says
and
there
are
better
stouts
in
england
and
better
beers
from
hook
norton
notes
another
sensational
beer
from
hook
norton
this
is
velvety
smooth
delicious
and
aromatic
delicious
chocolately
without
being
sweet
at
4
8
abv
this
makes
for
one
hell
of
a
session
beer
i
have
loved
every
hook
norton
beer
i
have
had
this
and
sam
smiths
are
my
favorite
two
british
brewers
o
very
drinkable
and
pleasant
stout
im
not
sure
what
makes
it
a
double
stout
as
its
not
particularly
heavy
or
robust
definitely
worth
a
try
and
might
be
a
good
starting
point
for
those
who
are
trying
to
get
into
darker
beers
this
is
a
good
stout
nice
representation
of
the
style
methinks
overall
good
english
stout
the
carbonation
was
just
too
much
for
me
and
i
couldnt
get
past
it
ill
try
this
one
again
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
o
this
beer
has
dark
roasted
grain
characters
that
or
dry
and
crisp
but
mellow
with
no
bitterness
but
all
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
a
bit
thin
some
nice
depth
to
the
beer
this
stout
poured
out
as
a
nice
black
color
with
a
good
looking
thick
head
on
top
of
it
the
lacing
was
minimal
if
there
was
any
at
all
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
coffee
roasted
malts
and
hints
of
chocolate
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
follows
right
along
with
the
smell
the
aftertaste
is
dry
and
has
a
burnt
toast
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
of
this
brew
is
quite
smooth
and
not
overly
heavy
overall
its
an
enjoyable
stout
from
england
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
one
day
o
very
nice
stout
to
sit
and
enjoy
either
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
mf
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
some
amber
hues
fluffy
tan
head
that
slowly
disappeared
and
created
a
nice
laceing
aroma
is
of
creamy
malts
and
chocolate
coffee
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
of
dark
bitter
sweet
chocolate
slightly
bittered
coffee
like
finish
i
liked
it
overall
its
interesting
but
either
this
beer
isnt
super
outstanding
within
the
style
or
this
is
a
particular
style
im
not
that
fond
of
im
not
sure
as
i
believe
this
is
my
first
english
stout
review
still
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
ive
enjoyed
the
taste
is
very
good
and
this
is
a
fine
stout
i
appreciate
the
4
8
abv
with
big
flavors
and
a
fairly
full
palate
some
of
the
american
brewers
should
take
note
that
you
dont
need
to
have
ridiculous
abv
to
make
a
fine
beer
and
often
the
abv
can
detract
as
much
as
impart
that
being
said
the
beer
has
nice
drying
dark
roasted
malts
some
sweeter
notes
do
form
underneath
but
the
beer
has
a
nice
semibitter
chocolate
flavor
throughout
this
beer
dries
up
considerably
in
the
finish
and
the
semibitter
becomes
full
out
dry
in
the
end
there
is
a
touch
of
metallic
in
this
beer
which
gets
in
the
way
and
detracts
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
light
to
medium
bodied
stout
that
has
lots
of
fine
qualities
im
glad
i
tried
this
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
will
be
bought
again
soon
very
easy
to
drink
good
solid
stout
but
a
bit
boring
id
never
refuse
this
it
is
good
but
easy
to
move
on
to
something
else
notes
some
ecuadoran
dark
chocolate
adds
rich
bittersweet
notes
that
drastically
improve
my
appreciation
of
the
beer
pours
out
very
dark
with
a
thick
off
white
head
smells
of
roasted
malt
with
hints
of
piney
wood
the
flavor
is
mostly
of
roasted
malt
with
a
mild
acidity
on
the
end
with
just
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
but
not
too
harsh
either
this
beer
is
sippable
but
thats
more
due
to
its
lower
abv
rather
than
to
an
outstanding
flavor
this
beer
is
worth
sampling
if
you
get
a
chance
but
there
are
so
many
wonderful
brews
out
there
i
doubt
ill
dwell
on
this
one
was
very
excited
to
pick
this
up
at
jungle
jims
and
when
i
brought
it
home
and
went
to
open
it
the
cap
nearly
flew
off
the
bottle
due
to
carbonation
not
sure
if
thats
usual
but
damn
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
beer
more
than
anything
but
i
really
couldnt
get
a
good
grasp
on
the
smell
due
to
the
fizzies
jumping
up
and
tickling
my
nose
and
the
mouthfeel
was
that
of
drinking
over
carbonated
drink
i
wouldnt
say
not
to
try
this
beer
but
it
definitely
wasnt
my
favorite
d
overall
this
is
a
good
standard
stout
i
wasnt
as
impressed
as
i
wanted
to
be
maybe
because
its
a
double
and
i
was
expecting
more
complexity
still
id
have
another
d
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
much
of
a
kick
sweetness
is
a
bit
much
but
this
would
be
a
nice
after
dinner
desert
beer
and
not
a
sit
with
it
all
night
d
eventually
the
chocolate
would
get
old
but
not
until
a
few
were
gone
lol
a
well
made
stout
best
served
on
a
cold
winter
night
with
the
wolfs
overcarbonated
opened
the
bottle
at
my
desk
and
a
couple
of
papers
fluttered
in
the
blast
of
co2
poured
a
mammoth
volume
of
very
foamy
frothy
sudsy
light
tan
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
clear
almost
opaque
very
dark
brown
aroma
is
malt
roast
toffee
cocoa
coffee
vanilla
flavor
is
like
aroma
and
very
tasty
no
sharpness
at
all
well
balanced
body
is
good
once
it
settles
down
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
medium
length
session
beer
a
solid
brew
with
a
lot
of
flavor
meets
the
bold
criteria
at
least
in
part
but
why
this
is
a
double
stout
remains
a
mystery
for
what
this
is
i
think
it
is
great
a
true
english
session
ale
overall
a
pretty
good
stout
although
there
are
better
examples
definitely
worth
a
try
though
notes
a
fairly
earthy
and
fruitytart
stout
that
is
a
little
light
but
also
sessionable
not
as
much
roasted
flavors
as
some
other
stouts
pretty
good
session
stout
that
is
nice
but
not
really
worth
searching
out
for
or
spending
a
lot
of
money
on
it
but
if
you
can
get
it
for
a
reasonable
price
go
for
it
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
a
well
rounded
character
this
is
a
great
unpretentious
simple
stout
love
it
bought
on
a
whim
while
in
the
mood
for
a
heavy
winter
uk
beer
opaque
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
where
if
you
shine
a
light
behind
the
glass
you
can
see
teeny
teeny
teeny
little
bubbles
quickly
flowing
in
evenlyspaced
columns
toward
the
top
of
the
brew
howd
they
do
that
pours
with
a
heavy
dense
and
ginormous
head
which
takes
forever
to
settle
down
into
a
puffy
mound
not
unlike
that
found
on
top
of
a
duvel
you
can
even
style
it
a
bit
with
your
fingers
loads
of
toffee
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
in
the
aroma
the
body
was
lighter
than
i
expected
which
isnt
necessarily
a
terrible
thing
the
taste
however
was
excellent
plenty
of
roast
and
toast
with
apricots
chocolate
raisins
and
a
slap
of
orange
at
the
end
lightly
hopped
but
theres
enough
to
give
an
edge
an
absolute
malty
delight
a
beer
which
has
earned
a
spot
in
my
refrigerator
door
according
to
the
web
site
its
only
available
for
two
months
out
of
the
year
ill
be
stocking
up
later
this
week
a
thin
dark
brown
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
deep
brown
with
ruby
highlights
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
competing
for
attention
nose
was
very
cocoalike
finish
was
extremely
chocolaty
like
birthday
cake
hey
my
birthday
is
coming
up
on
25
february
anybody
want
to
buy
me
a
bt
no
takers
quelle
domage
hook
norton
double
stout
poured
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
with
a
massive
foamy
tan
head
it
looked
like
a
root
beer
float
good
lacing
on
the
glass
as
well
smell
was
brown
sugar
and
roasted
coffee
taste
was
full
of
dark
chocolate
and
hints
of
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
was
ok
a
bit
sticky
but
not
bad
drinkability
was
good
overall
this
was
a
nice
stout
hard
to
come
by
the
english
stout
style
this
one
was
nice
what
a
super
crazy
craggy
tan
head
of
three
fingers
and
a
dark
cola
with
antique
copper
highlights
nice
column
of
bubbling
the
aroma
is
of
dry
chocolate
chips
dark
roasted
malts
light
brown
sugar
and
starbucks
french
roast
coffee
grounds
the
taste
is
very
roast
with
maybe
a
touch
of
smokey
oak
as
they
roast
some
coffee
beans
as
you
sit
with
some
hot
dark
cocoa
dry
bubbley
and
smooth
all
in
one
quite
the
session
stout
in
my
opinion
full
of
flavor
and
not
heavy
on
the
palate
dark
chocolate
with
a
touch
of
heavily
creamed
coffee
is
the
flavor
again
the
alcohol
is
more
present
than
the
abv
suggests
very
strong
carbonation
cuts
through
any
body
that
might
be
here
the
swallow
and
aftertaste
is
thin
but
it
laststhe
finish
is
almost
chewy
which
is
very
curious
a
very
pleasant
stout
with
a
distinctly
english
character
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
reddishbrown
color
that
is
just
barely
translucent
when
held
up
to
a
light
source
without
backlighting
the
beer
appears
opaque
and
black
the
head
is
a
relatively
thick
beige
mass
of
creamy
bubbles
that
dissipates
at
a
medium
pace
the
aroma
is
mostly
chocolate
malt
with
a
hint
of
hops
it
smells
like
creamy
chocolate
milk
with
a
hint
of
beer
really
the
roasted
malt
comes
through
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
flavor
there
are
notes
of
coffee
chocolate
toasted
bread
and
light
hops
its
a
very
pleasant
easy
drinking
beer
theres
a
ton
of
flavor
for
the
relatively
low
abv
at
least
as
compared
to
the
current
spectrum
of
stouts
i
really
enjoy
good
english
beer
styles
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
american
breweries
start
paying
more
attention
to
the
lower
alcohol
big
balanced
flavors
of
this
brewing
tradition
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
creamy
particularly
for
a
bottled
beer
a
boost
to
the
drinkability
scores
because
the
scores
for
both
smell
and
taste
werent
4
5s
but
certainly
better
than
4
0
the
sample
i
got

a

thanks
bill
drinkability
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
into
this
low
abv
beer
very
nice
when
i
saw
double
stout
on
the
label
i
expected
over
8
so
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
less
than
5
however
the
biggest
surprise
is
how
excellent
this
beer
really
is
easily
one
of
the
best
english
beers
ive
ever
had
i
must
check
out
their
other
offerings
d
i
snagged
a
gem
in
this
i
bought
it
on
a
whim
this
guy
is
a
recommended
brew
and
fancied
my
tastebuds
hook
norton
double
stout
is
too
expensive
to
be
a
regular
purchase
but
im
having
a
fine
time
with
this
bottle
and
what
a
great
looking
bottle
and
label
it
is
since
there
arent
too
many
classic
wellbrewed
english
stouts
available
in
america
i
wont
be
a
bit
surprised
if
it
sells
pretty
well
a
very
pleasant
basic
stout
pours
black
with
dissipitating
white
head
a
mild
aroma
creamy
mouthfeel
though
certainly
not
thick
satisfying
sessionable
alcohol
appreciated
and
adds
to
drinkability
based
on
pleasant
chocolate
malts
not
too
sweet
balanced
good
effort
for
not
trying
to
be
a
coffee
or
imperial
stout
bottle
poured
a
clear
deep
back
color
stout
with
large
light
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
dry
black
bitter
chocolate
with
some
light
coffee
taste
is
an
easy
going
mix
between
some
light
black
bitter
chocolate
some
roasted
malt
and
some
very
subtle
coffee
body
is
lacking
some
creamy
texture
with
great
carbonation
not
bad
overall
but
lacking
in
character

with
a

the
aroma
is
very
nice
it
smells
like
roasted

dark
fruit
caramel
dark
chocolate

a
bit

the
taste
is

drinkability
is
pretty
good
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
with
the
4
8
abv
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
its
quite
sessionable
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
english
stout
id
definitely
buy
this
again
in
the
future
recommended
so
far
touch
wood
i
am
yet
to
have
a
bum
beer
from
hook
norton
their
double
stout
was
a
beer
i
had
looked
for
in
various
offlicenses
and
shops
in
the
oxford
area
all
in
vain
opening
the
bottle
was
to
get
a
burst
of
roasted
coffee
aroma
once
poured
the
roasted
nature
of
the
nose
was
dominant
suggesting
a
full
flavour
to
come
the
beer
itself
was
pitch
black
with
a
loose
offwhite
head
coffee
was
also
the
major
flavour
in
the
beer
although
smoothed
out
by
a
velvety
chocolate
not
overly
bitter
fullbodied
and
beautifully
smooth
this
was
lovely
stuff
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
i
dont
think
this
beer
will
dissapoint
other
stout
styles
appeal
more
to
me
but
in
a
bar
especially
on
tap
id
happily
choose
this
the
aroma
is
very
toasty
with
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
cream
the
appearance
is
dark
brown
with
a
very
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
but
very
dry
the
palate
is
way
too
thin
for
a
stout
overall
its
a
good
tasting
and
smelling
stout
that
is
too
thin
overall
a
very
drinkable
stout
that
is
definitely
a
session
beer
it
was
very
enjoyable
and
definitely
worth
revisiting
would
be
interesting
to
find
this
on
tap
somewhere
one
of
the
better
english
stouts
ive
had
a
good
offering
not
sure
why
its
called
double
stout
though
black
pour
a
pretty
thick
head
with
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
rich
roasted
flavors
with
slight
chocolate
and
coffee
a
little
sticky
in
the
mouth
but
not
in
a
bad
way
solid
medium
body
very
smooth
and
finishes
pretty
clean
obviously
with
the
abv
this
is
quite
sessionable
a
good
english
stout
overall
not
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
but
one
i
would
enjoy
again
not
a
bad
buy
for
3
or
4
bucks
cheers
this
was
quite
an
enjoyable
offering
to
reflect
with
quietly
after
a
long
week
sessionable
but
brings
some
heft
well
done
and
extradrinkable
for
style
d
overall
this
is
a
stout
that
could
be
a
session
beer
not
too
strong
not
too
overpowering
and
very
easy
to
drink
its
definitely
a
beer
that
i
will
be
buying
again
d
this
is
a
good
stout
the
low
abv
makes
it
very
easy
to
have
a
few
and
it
is
quite
delicious
too
hook
norton
really
let
you
down
this
stout
is
no
different
a
good
example
of
an
english
stout
wow
one
of
the
best
and
biggest
sub
5
stouts
i
have
ever
had
full
of
dark
chocolate
notes
and
lots
of
big
roasted
malt
flavours
tastes
like
an
imperial
stout
with
all
the
complexity
but
very
drinkable
smooth
and
creamy
but
not
a
mindless
quaff
like
some
uk
stouts
the
taste
is
chocolate
prunes
toast
with
hint
of
licorice
its
fairly
sweet
and
oily
at
first
before
a
lighter
more
zesty
drier
finish
with
a
light
bitterness
added
pours
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
good
lace
nearly
black
color
hints
of
mahogany
highlights
roasted
coffeechocolate
nose
good
carbonation
and
heavy
bodied
flavor

at
finish

a
500ml

from

wells
me
d
an
enjoyable
stout
the
type
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
more
of
abv
is
low
flavor
is
high
easy
to
drink
reasonably
priced
i
recall
this
being
a
good
deal
at
pib
though
the
name
double
stout
confused
some
into
thinking
this
was
a
much
bigger
beer
than
it
really
is
as
is
double
stout
is
a
winner
and
a
brew
ill
buy
again
smooth
but
still
present
carbonation
very
thick
and
delicious
a
great
session
stout
full
flavored
easy
drinking
english
stout
anyone
thinking
it
will
be
like
an
american
double
stout
because
of
the
beers
name
will
be
sorely
disappointed
however
if
its
a
standard
english
stout
you
crave
this
will
more
than
satisfy
a
light
brown
colored
beer
that
appears
dark
brown
in
the
glass
the
light
tan
colored
head
lasts
around
for
quite
a
while
and
eventually
fades
into
a
ring
really
light
aromas
its
a
stretch
to
get
much
out
of
the
nose
at
all
but
it
does
have
some
coffee
and
roast
flavor
is
missing
a
lot
of
depth
and
complexity
a
touch
of
roast
but
overall
it
has
very
muted
flavors
and
aromas
the
mix
between
two
different
types
of
malts
is
an
interesting
experiment
and
you
can
definitely
taste
the
point
where
it
changes
from
one
type
to
another
still
it
doesnt
completely
work
as
a
beer
and
no
matter
how
interesting
it
is
you
still
have
to
be
able
to
drink
it
hook
norton
is
brewerery
that
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
getting
alot
of
their
wares
the
hooky
bitter
was
good
but
this
was
a
little
flat
in
my
opinion
poured
into
a
imperial
nonic
a
dark
cola
color
with
a
large
blooming
tan
colored
headtoasty
aromas
with
a
light
bitter
chocolate
tone
thin
and
almost
fizzy
mouthfeel
the
sharpness
really
never
totally
went
awayflavors
are
mainly
dark
toast
with
a
slight
burnt
flavor
along
with
some
passing
bitter
chocolate
a
very
average
stout
with
a
below
average
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
smooth
and
mellow
stout
with
decent
proportioning
and
a
smooth
profile
the
brew
plays
off
subtleties
to
create
a
deceptively
complex
profile
under
a
curiously
simple
backbone
not
one
of
the
best
but
a
nice
example
of
the
style
500ml
brown
bottle
from
rons
market
in
farmington
pours
a
black
body
with
rubyred
highlights
and
a
quarter
to
half
inch
of
very
light
tan
head
smells
roasty
with
caramel
nut
and
butter
notes
all
very
present
tastes
like
chocolate
butter
nut
caramel
flavors
are
each
subtle
but
together
make
a
pleasant
and
tasty
brew
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
despite
the
rich
flavor
and
moderate
mouthfeel
not
sure
what
makes
this
a
double
stout
but
its
a
phenomenal
english
stout
possibly
the
best
i
have
had
it
has
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
and
the
carbonation
is
lightish
it
finishes
with
a
dark
chocolate
bitterness
that
doesnt
go
overboard
nice
and
so
damn
drinkable
hell
its
under
5abv
now
this
is
a
sessionable
stout
indeed
too
bad
yet
again
that
i
only
picked
up
one
bottle
but
i
hope
to
pick
up
more
on
my
next
visit
if
they
still
have
some

my
fingers

overall
hook
norton
double
stout
is
a
solid
english
style
stout
that
is
subtle
but
well
crafted
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
dry
earthy
patent
and
roasted
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
tremendous
black
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
with
some
sweetness
but
finishes
dry
with
an
aggressive
earthiness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
these
guys
have
the
english
beer
styles
down
to
a
science
this
is
so
flavorful
yet
low
in
alcohol
and
highly
drinkable
hooray
to
the

basically
a

md
refreshingly
carbonated

with
everything
in

wo
being
too
predominant
to
spoil
the
balance
overall
i
personally
like
this
stout
to
bits
as
it
is
such
a
beautifully
balanced
and
delicious
stout
smokey
very
smoky
almost
burned

coffee

burnt

very
dark
with
a

that
doesnt
last
as
long
as
it
should
not
as

as
one
would
expect
but
very
stong
hangover
guaranteed

only
smuggled
to
the
us
still
very
nice
carbonation
drinkability
its
fairly
low
abv
and
powerful
dry
roasted

make
this
more
drinkable
than
i
initially
thought
after
the
first
sip
however
there
are
better
choices
to
drink
all
evening
toasty
fore
with
a
grapetinged
fruitiness
that
reminds
me
of
samuel
smiths
brewsall
of
samuel
smiths
brews
thin
for
a
stout
closer
to
a
porter
and
color
wise
would
be
a
porter
in
america
or
denmark
very
soft
feel
low
carbonation
estery
but
not
offputting
it
just
likes
any
sort
of
bitterness
its
toasty
but
falls
well
short
of
roasted
flavor
wise
its
like
they
toasted
the
most
sugary
sweet
malts
they
could
find
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
could
save
this
one
but
it
is
not
there
d
very
moreish
and
lots
of
flavour
for
the
abv
lots
of
good
roasted
notes
as
expected
with
a
delicate
yet
thick
chocolate
creaminess
a
lovely
stout
would
always
pick
this
over
a
drier
stout
pours
a
black
colour
with
a
small
tan
head
has
a
roasted
fruity
aroma
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
malty
roasted
fruity
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
ends
with
a
long
roasted
aftertaste
a
good
beer
the
taste
is
burned
roasted
bitter
and
a
bit
sour
i
found
notes
of
black
coffee
and
some
cream
the
body
was
surprisingly
weak
for
a
stout
the
aftertaste
is
rather
short
with
dry
burned
notes
just
a
really
good
stout
although
its
not
topnotch
hopefully
one
day
you
will
be
able
to
try
them
on
cask
also
fruity

rasins
figs
with
some

the

and
then
leads
into
a
chocolately
softly
roasty
bitter
finish
some
tangy
hops
in
the

also
found
the
beer
to
be
a

jammy
nice

nice

with

and
a
lighter
sauce
like
béchamel
or
mustard
sauce
im
not
sure
what
it
is
like
in
bottle
form
but
surely
it
must
be
better
than
this
overall
very
good
quality
australian
version
of
the
english
stout
used
to
be
4
9
but
now
for
some
reason
is
4
4
tastes
a
bit
more
like
a
very
strongflavoured
english
mild
rather
than
a
stout
still
very
tasty
though
and
i
assume
carlton
did
it
to
bring
the
prices
down
when
the
aussie
govt
decided
to
charge
more
the
higher
the
abv
od
nothing
special
yet
not
bad
for
a
macro
dark
ale
or
whatever
style
its
intention
is
a
tad
sweet
but
otherwise
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
this
over
carltons
other
offerings
o
not
sure
about
the
categorization
as
english
stout
but
it
is
surprisingly
good
it
is
very
basic
really
but
it
works
i
cant
think
of
anything
better
from
cub
not
a
bad
drop
from
the
worlds
worst
brewer
mild
dry
porter
inoffensive
style
and
somewhat
lighert
in
palate
weight
than
the
beer
i
think
is
trying
to
emulate
tooheys
old
excellent
colour
its
actually
black
surprisngly
easy
to
drink
as
a
quaffer
extremely
watery
body
really
detracts
from
the
experience
like
i
said
its
not
unpleasant
thats
pretty
decent
praise
for
a
brewery
which
comes
up
with
some
of
the
most
diabolical
beers
on
earth
while
it
certainly
is
lacking
it
has
some
pleasant
characters
and
id
certainly
rather
down
a
pint
of
this
than
of
carlton
draught
or
vb
i
am
truly
in
shock
fosters
group
actually
makes
a
good
beer
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
any
time
its
hard
to
believe
that
this
comes
from
the
same
company
that
makes
carlton
draught
and
vb
quite
drinkable
but
i
felt
it
was
lacking
not
something
id
actively
seek
out
but
ok
every
now
and
again
still
not
a
bad
beer
but
id
prefer
an
abbotsford
invalid
over
this
would
i
drink
it
again
yep
but
only
if
i
am
in
the
mood
the
final
sweetness
left
after
the
swallow
just
seemed
a
little
artificial
syrupy
for
my
general
liking
overall
tastes
a
bit
like
a
dumbed
down
porter
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
a
good
beer
from
one
of
the
most
boring
breweries
in
the
world
not
much
bitterness
i
think
the
term
mild
is
best
applied
here
this
beer
is
basically
mild
inoffensive
not
a
whole
lot
to
work
with
here
but
still
manages
to
be
quie
enjoyable
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
my
first
english
stout
to
date
poured
into
a
stella
artois
chalice
a
black
color
with
a
little
bit
of
brown
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
a
small
white
lace
head
not
much
in
the
nose
department
besides
maybe
a
bit
of
burnt
coffee
and
some
smoke
characters
taste
was
decent
with
coffee
light
chocolate
all
up
front
and
a
roasted
background
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
surprising
amount
of
hop
bitterness
right
up
until
the
end
being
on
the
light
side
made
it
a
pretty
easy
beer
to
drink
not
a
beer
with
a
myriad
of
complexities
or
anything
groundbreaking
but
it
is
still
an
easy
drinking
beer
not
bad
not
great
still
probably
worth
a
try
pours
a
very
deep
dark
ruby
color
with
some
tan
head
thats
really
not
as
creamy
as
im
used
to
with
stouts
or
black
ales
there
really
isnt
much
aroma
to
this
beer
at
all
i
think
i
smell
a
faint
faint
hint
of
chocolate
malt
but
i
cant
be
sure
the
taste
is
pretty
mellow
for
a
stout
but
looking
at
the
bottle
theyre
not
claiming
its
a
stout
just
a
black
ale
and
for
that
it
tastes
good
balanced
flavor
with
some
chocolate
notes
to
it
not
a
whole
lot
of
bitterness
but
theres
a
little
hop
flavor
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
not
much
carbonation
at
all
all
in
all
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
not
overly
strong
but
it
is
there
and
its
good
which
is
more
than
most
macro
beers
have
taste
isnt
bad
however
i
am
not
usually
a
fan
of
strong
darker
beers
and
so
i
am
led
to
believe
that
this
one
would
generally
be
considered
bland
its
essentially
chocolatey
and
weak
there
is
naturally
a
dark
beer
flavour
but
without
the
overwhelming
chloriney
burnttoast
bitterness
i
sometimes
experience
i
am
leaning
towards
giving
this
a
rave
review
for
a
dark
beer
but
i
can
step
back
from
my
own
general
mistrust
of
its
style
and
appreciate
that
its
really
too
simple
to
be
regarded
as
a
truly
great
beer
its
very
drinkable
i
like
it
but
its
nothing
to
cream
yourself
over
but
then
when
you
drink
it
from
the
bottle
its
vb
with
extras
that
standard
cub
yeasty
flavour
predominates
and
you
realise
its
all
a
sham
get
it
fresh
on
tap
if
youre
going
to
give
this
a
try
flavor
is
sweet
toffee
and
some
black
coffee
with
again
a
hint
of
molasses
the
finish
lingers
bittersweet
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
not
what
i
expected
but
good
however
i
would
be
happy
to
buy
an
drink
this
again
drinkability
3

really
this
is
just
vb
or
draught
with
roasted
malts
and
luckily
for
cub
adding
this
to
a
beer
can
sometimes
hide
a
multitude
of
sins
in
this
case
its
got
them
close
to
average
i
wouldnt
be
getting
too
carried
away
if
i
was
them
tho
they
might
brew
something
decent
sometime
this
millenium
pretty
drinkable
little
brew
nice
subtle
roastiness
but
a
bit
sticky
or
something
didnt
do
all
that
much
with
flavour
either
but
skullable
not
a
bad
price
either
average
beer
ill
drink
it
again
very
nice
coffee
and
maple
flavours
very
good
beer
nearly
equal
with
sap
sucker
id
say
prost
lampertland
overall
this
is
alright
i
guess
i
understand
what
they
were
going
for
and
the
nose
on
this
one
certainly
worked
but
the
taste
and
palate
didnt
deliver
artificial
tasting
too
mild
and
somewhat
watery
this
one
ended
up
being
a
disappointment
keep
the
nose
and
try
to
rework
the
rest
as
there
is
some
real
potential
here
thanks
again
kjyost
cheers
o
one
of
my
favourite
stouts
great
beer
not
an
overpowering
stout
but
great
flavours
o
quite
drinkable
but
on
the
sweeter
side
i
honestly
think
that
others
have
rated
it
lower
than
what
it
deserves
simply
because
the
brewery
is
not
well
known
after
tasting
cbs
a
few
days
ago
i
would
say
this
is
a
decent
maple
stout
id
drink
it
again
so
that
says
something
i
like
finding
unexpected
gems
from
obscure
breweries
and
this
one
fits
the
bill
o
if
you
like
maple
like
i
do
then
your
best
bet
is
to
just
smell
this
beer
all
night
long
the
mouthfeel
just
ruins
it
still
a
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
but
could
be
so
much
more
its
tough
to
put
out
a
good
maple
beer
given
all
the
subpar
offerings
out
there
but
this
manages
to
get
all
the
flavours
right
just
about
no
head
on
this
the
color
is
black
can
see
no
light
at
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
smells
very
sweet
malt
and
maple
tones
taste
just
about
the
same
sweet
with
a
light
taste
of
maple
goes
down
well
with
a
crisp
after
taste
very
good
beer
very
recommended
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
best
maple
syrup
beer
of
the
few
i
have
had
believe
this
to
be
a
well
made
beer
but
uncaramelized
maple
flavour
isnt
one
id
personally
choose
so
will
probably
not
purchase
again
this
is
a
mapleheavy
beer
for
a
maple
lover
probably
very
good
not
being
one
i
dont
think
it
is
a
great
beer
certainly
delivers
what
it
promises
anyone
else
feel
like
pancakes
now
this
is
what
id
consider
a
breakfast
stout
cannery
brewings
maple
stout
could
easily
be
the
darling
of
sweet
toothed
beer
drinkers
everywhere
a
stout
flavoured
like
maple
fudge
pumpkinpie
spice
and
melted
chocolate
it
may
be
a
cheap
gimmick
but
is
there
a
better
a
coolweather
treat
d
quite
a
good
stout
with
a
well
executed
maple
flavour
its
quite
tasty
and
something
id
probably
pick
up
again
in
my
years
of
drinking
ales
this
is
certainly
the
first
maple
beer
that
ive
actually
enjoyed
which
i
find
strange
i
mean
it
sounds
amazing
on
paper
i
love
beer
i
love
maple
syrup
but
somehow
every
edition
of
the
style
seems
to
fall
flat
now
this
brew
still
could
use
some
work
the
body
isnt
quite
right
and
lacks
the
depth
of
a
good
american
stout
or
ris
but
nevertheless
its
an
enjoyable
brew
that
fits
the
season
well
and
provides
a
welcome
change
from
all
those
pumpkin
ales
overall
the
beer
has
a
great
maple
scent
but
it
needed
more
in
the
taste
department
it
actually
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
vanilla
coke
im
happy
i
gave
it
a
shot
but
id
buy
something
else
next
time
pours
almost
black
with
some
dark
cola
around
the
edges
tan
head
is
thick
and
produced
immediately
loads
of
carbonation
requires
several
attempts
at
the
pours
but
settles
to
a
nice
cap
nose
has
alot
of
maple
dark
and
milk
chocolate
with
more
of
a
darker
leaning
hint
of
coffee
taste
is
milk
chocolate
dipped
in
maple
syrup
some
caramel
and
vanilla
notes
finish
is
a
bit
roasty
mouthfeel
is
relatively
light
and
highly
effervescent
offputting
initially
but
swirled
it
down
to
a
more
manageable
level
sweet
but
expected
for
the
advertised
flavour
profile
a
decent
stout
that
i
could
revisit
but
the
carbonation
needs
to
be
toned
down
quite
a
few
notches
quality
stout
that
has
enough
maple
flavour
to
be
noticed
but
isnt
overpowering
or
too
sweet
could
use
a
bit
more
body
but
is
quite
drinkable
and
smooth
as
it
is
deep
brown
near
black
one
finger
of
tan
head
some
lace
smell
is
of
sweet
maple
roast
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
bread
like
qualities
smells
a
lot
like
a
maple
donut
taste
has
lots
of
maple
but
not
as
much
as
the
nose
would
lead
you
to
believe
roasty
and
bittersweet
lightly
sweet
maple
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
medhigh
carb
med
body
lightly
watery
and
thin
at
points
this
was
really
good
and
the
bomber
went
quickly
on
my
own
would
love
to
see
an
imperial
version
of
this
o
a
very
nice
maple
stout
and
i
had
no
difficulty
sucking
back
this
bomber
i
e
not
too
sweet
back
o
this
is
the
canadian
of
flavoured
beers
everything
about
it
has
a
strong
maple
presence
it
is
one
of
the
better
maple
stouts
i
have
tried
because
although
it
tastes
strongly
of
maple
i
dont
find
it
overly
sweet
definitely
recommended
for
maplelovers
od
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
but
a
bit
misleading
smells
better
than
it
tastes
for
sure
but
it
stills
tastes
pretty
good
and
i
had
no
problem
getting
this
down
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
it
i
believe
this
is
a
good
solid
stout
im
a
sucker
for
maple
beers
so
i
had
to
give
it
a
try
overall
i
really
like
this
stuff
and
could
go
though
a
lot
of
it
pretty
quickly
feelin
like
a
canadian
stereotype
here
but
ya
maple
and
beer
done
well
canuck
heaven
yum
d
this
is
my
second
beer
from
cannery
blackberry
porter
but
when
they
say
a
flavor
for
a
beer
they
dont
hold
back
this
stout
has
tons
of
maple
from
the
aroma
to
the
taste
so
if
you
like
maple
you
need
to
try
this
beer
if
not
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
because
youll
have
tons
of
maple
overall
awesome
maple
aroma
and
a
taste
that
while
good
doesnt
quite
live
up
it
is
still
tasty
and
worth
your
while
to
check
out
bottle
poured
a
medium
black
color
stout
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
dry
roasted
malt
notes
with
some
notes
clear
notes
of
maple
which
are
surprisingly
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
loads
of
maple
notes
with
well
balanced
sweetness
and
some
dry
roasted
notes
body
is
a
bit
thin
for
style
with
some
very
good
carbonation
very
interesting
experiment
with
maple
notes
being
clearly
identifiable
and
some
well
balanced
sweetness
not
sure
i
would
have
this
often
but
well
brewed
nonetheless
d
the
maple
sweetness
makes
it
very
pleasant
on
the
palate
left
me
craving
the
next
taste
like
a
desert
does
fairly
easy
drinking
d
delicious
but
more
of
a
dessert
beer
than
anything
a
little
too
sweet
to
be
sessionable
but
a
very
nice
beer
at
that
would
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
as
it
is
surprisingly
delicious
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
have
been
planning
a
maple
stout
for
myself
for
a
while
now
i
have
something
to
style
it
after
650ml
bomber
pours
a
black
color
with
a
big
creamy
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
really
nice
aroma
of
maple
syrup
roasted
malt
and
coffee
kinda
smells
like
a
pancake
breakfast
the
taste
is
more
maple
syrup
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
very
smooth
leaves
a
nice
maple
aftertaste
the
sweetness
of
the
maple
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
and
this
is
definitely
not
a
session
beer
but
it
makes
a
nice
dessert
beer
i
really
liked
this
overall
im
so
glad
we
have
brewers
like
cannery
in
bc
great
canadian
beer
in
the
most
stereotypical
sense
of
the
word
but
they
do
it
in
a
very
complimentary
way
once
i
adjusted
to
the
mapleness
shouldnt
be
necesaary
im
canadian
afterall
nice
hoser
take
on
traditional
stout
drinkability
winter
time
only
id
say
not
what
id
call
a
refreshing
drink
after
650ml
of
this
stuff
ive
had
my
fill
for
a
while
i
think
of
this
one
as
more
of
a
novelty
to
be
had
once
in
a
while
like
i
said
its
a
stout
with
maple
and
it
does
exactly
what
it
says
on
the
label
thanks
bryan
would
be
a
fantabulous
beer
if
they
toned
down
the
maple
a
bit
a
decent
dry
stout
in
its
own
right
although
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
all
the
same
while
the
maple
character
nearly
disappears
as
it
warms
remaining
present
as
an
underlying
yet
enjoyable
sweetness
more
than
a
distinctive
character
i
didnt
necessarily
rate
this
high
yet
i
still
have
a
soft
spot
for
maple
and
still
commend
cannery
for
the
effort
overall
a
pleasantly
tasty
stout
with
a
variable
maple
goodness
and
not
too
sweet
as
much
as
i
like
the
headon
maple
assault
of
ambers
sap
vampire
this
one
is
much
more
judicious
in
its
application
of
our
national
trees
effluent
and
a
very
respectable
addition
to
the
growing
canadian
maplethemed
beer
canon
if
you
like
maple
check
this
one
out
i
seriously
am
craving
pancakes
now
not
so
much
stout
character
gets
through
but
maple
is
a
pretty
strong
flavour
to
compete
with
i
actually
found
the
maple
added
a
sweetness
to
the
finish
which
increasesd
the
drinkability
the
stout
is
pretty
well
made
with
enough
mouthfeel
to
satisfy
not
as
good
as
back
hand
of
god
but
still
a
good
bc
stout
i
like
the
way
the
maple
cut
the
bitterness
and
added
to
the
balance
of
the
beer
nice
beer
but
the
sour
character
from
the
maple
forces
me
to
sip
this
one
when
it
could
easily
almost
be
a
session
stout
the
only
stout
i
could
find
in
central
america
belikin
stout
has
a
good
deal
to
offer
but
unfortunately
true
satiation
is
not
among
those
things
though
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
export
stout
style
it
lacks
the
body
and
backbone
and
as
result
comes
across
as
too
wispy
or
though
its
not
a
term
i
like
to
use
watereddown
even
but
hey
nice
to
see
this
option
alongside
the
lager
o
lots
of
flavours
going
on
but
i
just
wish
it
tasted
fresher
and
more
alive
its
dark
and
brooding
and
that
liquoriceroot
beer
taste
sticks
with
me
interesting
and
worth
tasting
just
to
experience
it
overall
not
bad
for
the
other
belikin
especially
at
6
5
but
dont
look
for
something
heavy
on
the
roasted
and
charred
malt
if
thats
what
youre
after
brought
back
to
the
states
from
my
sister
and
poured
into
my
green
lantern
pint
glass
pours
with
minimal
foam
along
with
the
typical
malty
smell
not
really
out
of
the
ordinary
from
this
english
stout
while
i
expected
some
great
scores
from
my
sister
this
wasnt
exactly
what
i
had
in
mind
still
this
beer
is
desirable
and
tastes
quite
great
who
knew
the
mayans
made
english
stouts
o
excellent
beer
best
from
the
region
i
have
had
while
in
the
region
this
should
be
imported
this
is
a
nice
stout
refreshing
and
balanced
its
not
as
hoppy
or
rich
as
guinness
foreign
export
but
its
very
decent
a
must
try
if
youre
ever
in
belize
reviewed
from
notes
served
in
a
tumbler
at
duplooys
jungle
lodge
in
the
cayo
district
of
belize
pours
a
deep
brown
with
red
highlights
and
the
edges
and
a
half
inch
loose
khakicolored
head
that
dissipates
into
a
consistent
sudsy
skim
embedded
with
tiny
ringlets
nose
expresses
a
light
roast
and
a
slight
char
and
perhaps
a
little
nuttiness
aromas
of
something
slightly
metallic
also
come
out
in
the
nose
taste
follows
nose
nutty
roasty
and
a
trace
of
lactose
theres
also
a
faint
metallic
quality
and
trace
of
artificial
sweetener
at
the
finish
and
a
slightly
bitter
charred
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
but
closer
to
light
with
an
even
carbonation
that
culminates
in
a
slight
prickle
at
the
back
of
the
throat
all
and
all
a
decent
dry
stout
not
something
i
would
readily
seek
out
but
a
respectable
example
of
the
style
i
had
this
beer
with
some
fresh
home
grilled
burgers
and
i
have
to
say
it
tasted
excellent
when
paired
with
a
food
for
the
most
part
prefood
it
lacked
a
bit
in
flavor
it
had
the
english
stout
feel
but
not
the
taste
overall
its
a
nice
beer
to
try
and
it
is
also
not
a
full
pint
if
i
had
another
bottle
id
definately
drink
it
so
unless
im
in
belize
i
wont
be
hungering
for
more
pours
a
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
a
stingy
almost
tan
head
recedes
entirely
to
quickly
i
get
very
little
out
of
the
nose
corn
masa
is
very
prominent
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
if
i
stare
at
the
glass
and
imagine
a
bit
taste
hits
me
with
toffee
and
caramel
up
front
then
leads
into
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
maybe
some
chocolate
if
i
close
my
eyes
and
think
of
willy
wonka
a
bit
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
really
light
stout
maybe
its
appropriate
for
the
scorching
heat
they
normally
see
in
belize
i
found
it
rather
pedestrian
while
sampling
from
nh
in
the
65
degree
heat
medium
body
and
carbonation
level
thin
watery
mouthfeel
i
hate
to
hate
on
this
but
as
a
stout
this
is
not
all
that
great
compared
to
the
light
lagers
available
in
belize
i
would
naturally
chose
this
one
as
i
am
a
stout
head
i
love
the
dark
malts
compared
to
other
stouts
this
one
would
rank
pretty
low
in
my
book
not
quite
black
some
mahogany
tones
in
the
light
clear
with
a
minimal
diminishing
light
tan
head
faint
aromas
of
dark
caramel
dark
dried
fruit
and
maybe
some
nuttiness
pretty
big
dark
malt
sweetness
is
not
quite
balanced
by
a
lack
of
roasty
or
hop
bitterness
roundish
and
fullbodied
lightly
carbonated
average
drinking
interesting
for
a
stout
and
to
be
honest
maybe
more
my
style
as
for
clarification
blue
cap
is
indeed
the
stout
and
it
says
so
on
that
very
cap
green
is
the
standard
beer
and
lighthouse
has
its
own
packaging
overall
a
sold
little
beer
from
belize
much
better
then
i
would
have
thought
it
was
going
to
be
and
i
revisit
this
one
overall
everything
about
this
brew
is
subdued
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
like
the
fact
that
its
a
light
stout
that
i
would
have
again
drinkability
is
this
beers
strong
suit
this
beer
is
flavorful
enough
but
doesnt
bog
you
down
with
lots
of
alcohol
or
a
big
huge
thick
mouthfeel
a
nice
option
for
the
warm
belize
climate
belikin
stout
has
to
be
classified
as
a
disappointment
having
said
that
and
given
what
else
is
available
in
central
america
its
probably
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
in
that
region
of
the
world
dont
expect
much
and
youll
be
fine
thanks
to
t
for
being
kind
enough
to
give
me
the
final
bottle
from
the
case
she
brought
back
from
her
recent
honeymoon
to
belize
what
a
find
especially
after
time
in
the
land
of
gallo
lounging
on
a
warm
beach
sipping
a
belikin
stout
in
the
hot
caribbean
sun
ah
memories
excellent
stout
and
cheap
to
boot
a
thick
feel
although
not
too
thick
to
be
refreshing
and
a
coffeeesque
taste
make
this
one
to
enjoy
slowly
contrary
to
other
reviews
you
can
tell
the
difference
between
the
styles
from
this
brewery
the
stout
if
i
recall
has
a
green
cap
and
label
mouthfeel
is
delightfully
smooth
with
enough
body
to
distinguish
it
as
a
stout
without
being
at
all
chewy
it
goes
down
astonishingly
easy
drinkability
is
exceptional
at
6
5
2
of
em
will
have
you
speaking
in
the
local
accent
john
the
color
is
a
very
deep
red
black
and
it
has
a
nice
full
brown
head
that
maintains
some
presence
throughout
some
lace
that
is
not
very
sticky
a
malty
roasted
aroma
that
is
fairly
onedimensional
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
a
dry
biting
finish
that
lingers
the
mouth
feel
is
well
balanced
has
a
descent
amount
of
carbonation
love
stout
doesnt
really
live
up
to
its
luscious
description
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
a
bad
beer
i
noticed
on
the
website
that
draft
versions
of
this
beer
are
on
nitro
and
i
can
see
this
beer
taking
on
a
richer
quality
there
as
it
is
this
is
a
pretty
flavorful
very
drinkable
stout
and
i
personally
dont
care
for
hoppy
stouts
ill
keep
this
one
on
my
radar
overall
this
was
worse
than
i
imagined
it
reminds
me
of
guinness
extra
which
is
far
from
a
compliment
everything
about
it
screams
weak
musty
and
watery
a
six
pack
runs
10
around
me
a
bomber
is
the
same
price
thats
a
freakin
joke
im
surprised
by
some
of
the
high
ratings
glad
i
only
got
a
single
everything
iv
had
from
this
brewery
is
average
at
best
pass
this
one
up
in
all
seriousness
wow
not
a
stout
guy
but
like
ive
had
other
chocolate
and
coffee
stouts
and
they
always
taste
horrible
this
one
is
the
best
smells
like
nothing
but
coffee
slight
chocolate
it
was
slightly
bitter
with
a
hint
of
coffee
flavor
my
only
complaint
is
the
bar
i
was
in
served
it
slightly
warm
which
isnt
the
beers
fault
the
love
stout
had
a
very
nice
pour
black
to
the
color
and
and
a
tan
head
to
it
the
aroma
was
of
coffee
and
sweet
chocolate
i
liked
the
flavor
too
it
was
a
bit
smoky
and
roasted
coffee
and
a
sweet
chocolate
creamy
finish
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
decent
stout
and
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
it
overall
i
should
have
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
over
hop
juju
its
a
very
sessionable
smooth
semi
sweet
stout
had
this
at
the
fireside
tavern
in
strasburg
it
was
one
of
two
porters
on
tap
very
good

this
from
bottle
to

you
beer
hippies
of
coffee
tobacco
and
chocolate
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
not
hightest
or
heavy
so
right
up
my
alley
sessionable
in
winter
when
baseball
season
seems
an
eternity
away
and
you
figure
just
settle
in
with
a
dark
beer
and
hibernate
dont
know
if
it
was
a
bad
batch
but
it
had
a
very
skunky
taste
to
it
overall
this
is
an
interesting
stout
in
that
it
does
not
bowl
you
over
with
roasted
malts
and
burnt
coffee
but
it
does
deliver
complex
malt
flavor
if
you
want
a
sweet
creamy
stout
then
try
this
one
ive
enjoyed
this
stout
and
would
be
happy
to
have
another
in
the
world
of
big
beers
and
imperial
stouts
its
easy
to
forget
the
simple
pleasures
of
a
lower
above
lower
intensity
stout
with
gentle
but
comfortably
full
flavors
if
what
you
are
looking
for
to
drink
are
the
big
flavors
and
intensities
of
imperial
stouts
this
beer
is
not
for
you
but
if
you
want
to
relax
and
enjoy
a
low
abv
but
fairly
fullflavored
stout
this
is
a
good
place
to
start

love
is
a
bit
strong
still
a
moderately
impressive
stout
this
was
a
solid
stout
but
nothing
special
a
solid
stout
from
a
solid
brewery
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
snow
laden
streets
of
philadelphia
had
some
good
times
around
it
pretty
standard
stout
mid
to
heavy
body
mid
thickness
in
mouth
feel
chocolaty
notes
with
roasted
malts
middle
of
the
road
but
still
pretty
tasty
i
strongly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
avid
coffee
drinkers
great
job
with
this
beer
perfect
taste
for
me
for
a
stout
went
down
very
smoothly
this
could
easily
be
my
goto
stout
chocolate
taste
was
nice
maybe
just
a
tad
too
much
but
beats
the
normal
coffee
flavor
which
isnt
my
thing
will
be
buying
this
to
keep
on
hand
pours
a
dark
brownish
black
with
a
creamy
tab
head
and
lacing
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
coffee
and
vanilla
a
bit
of
caramel
in
the
taste
coffee
roasted
malt
and
an
earthy
hop
presence
though
well
balanced
this
is
a
fairly
bitter
beer
drinks
smooth
and
easily
overall
a
quality
stout
that
works
well
in
a
nitro
format
overall
very
good
and
i
feel
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
very
happy
with
it
wont
hesitate
to
order
again
o
this
beer
is
right
on
for
the
style
and
the
abv
gives
it
enough
body
without
compromising
drinkability
overall
a
rather
tasty
easy
drinking
and
fairly
balanced
stout
well
worth
a
try
if
you
get
the
chance
this
was
a
decent
beer
though
i
thought
there
could
have
been
a
bit
more
flavor
o
good
i
think
the
oysters
really
do
add
something
nice
overall
a
nice
beer
that
seems
appropriate
for
serving
on
nitrogen
o
another
nice
beer
from
yards
not
overly
complex
but
done
well
and
easy
drinking
this
stout
has
really
evolved
with
yards
tonight
its
a
great
dry
irish
stout
with
a
bit
more
touch
sour
finish
and
fluffy
dry
like
guiness
lingering
dark
head
great
on
nitro
i
bet
i
just
hat
e
how
beer
advocate
makes
y
xml
out
the
records
to
a
minimum
of
250
words
sometimes
i
just
dont
hac
e
mush
to
say
drinking
and
all
shiiite
man
a
rich
black
bodied
beer
with
a
small
brown
head
that
dissipates
almost
immediately
lacing
is
spotty
aroma
is
fairly
standard
roast
a
little
chocolate
plus
a
faint
mineral
note
id
attribute
to
the
oystershell
inclusion
taste
is
the
same
simple
straightforward
uncomplicated
nice
dark
malt
gentle
roast
and
bit
of
hoppy
bitterness
bittersweet
chocolate
again
the
mineral
note
smooth
mouthfeel
mediumlight
body
moderately
carbonated
one
of
the
better
tap
offerings
from
yards
in
my
opinion
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
o
as
competition
for
guinness
and
local
breweries
renditions
of
that
classic
this
beer
does
well
to
be
smoother
and
stronger
however
a
little
roast
and
maybe
some
special
b
would
really
knock
this
beer
up
to
a
whole
new
level
m
the
creaminess
smooth
with
the
chocolate
is
a
nice
touch
just
solidly
good
overall
went
to
a
big
concert
and
this
was
the
best
beer
they
had
on
tap
hence
ordering
i
was
incredibly
impressed
o
it
had
been
years
since
i
had
one
of
these
a
great
stout
overall
i
look
forward
to
more
in
the
near
future
black
with
a
huge
cream
colored
head
that
took
a
long
while
to
settle
down
lace
made
the
glass
opaque
this
was
definatly
fresh
smell
was
of
rosted
malts
with
a
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
was
great
roasted
coffee
and
malts
very
nice
slight
hop
is
the
back
and
the
taste
lingered
deep
dark
chocolate
with
a
bit
of
caramel
very
nicely
done
the
mouthfeel
was
almost
perfect
for
a
stout
thick
nicely
carbonated
smooth
delivery
this
was
okay
it
wasnt
anything
special
but
went
down
extremely
easy
and
i
enjoyed
it
im
not
too
sure
if
its
anything
id
really
ever
order
again
though
not
bad
not
great
pretty
standard
thanks
for
the
pint
yards
its
an
okay
tasting
stout
reminds
me
of
a
better
tasting
guinness
highlight
is
the
feel
thats
about
it
with
the
taste
being
okay
i
have
had
oyster
stouts
before
this
certainly
didnt
come
off
as
one
this
poured
out
as
a
decent
looking
dark
brownish
black
brew
not
very
thick
looking
at
all
kind
of
watery
to
say
the
least
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
nice
roasted
and
chocolaty
aromas
to
it
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
a
sweet
and
a
little
bitter
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
mostly
flat
from
the
cask
a
little
watered
down
also
overall
id
rather
have
this
on
regular
draft
or
from
a
bottle
i
think
there
was
no
written
indication
that
this
was
on
nitrotap
but
judging
by
the
appearance
i
believe
it
was
poured
an
opaque
black
with
the
milkiest
creamiest
head
ive
ever
seen
on
a
beer
foamy
white
with
tan
shadowing
and
it
retained
to
the
last
drop
and
laced
nicely
nice
roasty
aroma
with
notes
of
coffee
roasted
malts
and
coffee
in
the
taste
milk
chocolate
with
light
briny
notes
in
the
background
giving
an
interesting
blend
of
flavors
not
too
thick
in
the
body
but
still
very
creamy
which
i
attributed
mostly
to
the
ubiquitous
head
very
nice
and
very
drinkable
this
was
my
first
oyster
stout
and
although
i
was
a
bit
squeamish
about
the
style
at
first
i
know
it
wont
be
my
last
the
aromas
a
little
weak
but
this
stout
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
character
that
even
has
hints
of
chocolate
and
some
earthy
hops
in
the
finish
after
reading
the
description
of
this
beer
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
almost
an
oyster
bomb
of
a
beer
but
i
can
only
detect
them
slightly
in
the
finish
medium
to
full
body
nice
low
carbonation
level
velvety
smooth
across
the
palate
finishes
dry
id
get
this
again
d
the
oysters
get
a
tad
bit
overwhelming
however
very
palatable
and
would
pair
well
with
greasy
apps
sessionable
abv
d
real
easy
going
on
this
one
nothing
to
write
home
about
thou
a
nice
and
simple
stout
i
will
toss
some
oysters
at
it
some
time
soon
and
see
how
it
pairs
this
beer
is
opaque
waiting
for
the
copious
head
to
subside
you
are
treated
to
malty
chocolate
aromas
at
first
taste
is
very
clean
and
smooth
like
unsweetened
whipped
cream
a
slight
stouty
bitterness
devolopes
as
you
get
into
it
drinkability
is
excellent
an
occaisional
briny
hint
with
good
smooth
mouthfeel
and
little
astringency
highly
recommended
the
20102011
edition
of
this
winter
seasonal
may
be
the
best
yards
has
ever
brewed
and
having
it
on
nitro
is
a
really
nice
cold
weather
treat
d
one
of
the
best
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
while
the
taste
and
flavors
were
comparable
of
a
guinness
but
this
was
much
better
hoping
to
buy
some
bottles
of
this
one
next
time
i
am
at
yards
went
to
yards
to
get
my
beloved
love
stout
when
i
arrived
at
the
chalk
broad
i
noticed
love
stout
said
not
available
getting
ready
to
leave
i
noticed
that
they
had
just
tapped
a
cask
of
love
stout
my
friend
mentioned
that
i
had
wanted
some
and
kevin
was
so
kind
to
pour
my
friends
and
i
five
free
samples
large
samples
at
that
it
was
exceptionally
fresh
and
smooth
dark
with
small
tan
head
aroma
is
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
sweet
smooth
and
flavorful
the
oysters
really
add
a
nice
compliment
to
the
roasted
malt
flavor
i
came
back
the
next
day
and
had
another
pint
it
was
again
exceptional
but
had
lost
just
a
touch
of
its
freshness
kevin
again
hooked
each
of
us
up
with
a
pint
for
nothing
what
a
great
guy
and
group
of
guys
there
at
yards
i
have
been
waiting
a
while
to
try
this
one
and
i
must
say
one
of
the
very
best
stouts
from
pa
ive
had
very
sessionable
brew
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
id
like
to
try
it
ontap
as
opposed
to
nitro
as
i
bet
the
smell
would
be
sufficiently
enhanced
to
make
this
beer
better
overall
still
its
worth
a
shot
in
whatever
serving
method
you
find
pours
a
deep
dark
near
black
with
only
faint
highlights
of
brown
around
the
edges
firm
cap
of
brown
head
from
the
hand
pump
and
good
retention
and
lacing
scent
is
earthy
with
notes
of
dark
roasted
grains
bitter
chocolate
char
smoke
and
a
touch
of
coffee
taste
is
a
nice
combination
of
the
above
notes
from
scent
along
with
some
creamy
sweetness
nothing
too
bold
or
overpowering
but
solid
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
wonderfull
on
cask
with
the
appropriate
carbonation
the
newly
revisted
casknitro
version
with
the
oysters
blows
the
prior
bottle
and
tap
version
from
23
years
ago
out
of
the
water
highly
drinkable
love
stout
is
black
black
and
dismal
with
a
nice
dark
tan
head
thats
bubbly
and
milkshakey
a
nice
smear
of
bubbles
on
the
glass
remain
smell
is
english
in
that
the
ingredients
are
not
bold
there
is
some
chocolate
cocco
roast
smoke
and
salt
from
da
oysters
i
dont
like
oysters
in
general
to
slimy
for
me
feel
wise
but
they
do
impart
a
distinct
salty
vibe
with
some
other
taste
i
cant
quite
describe
besides
that
this
taste
is
a
light
mix
of
everything
i
just
said
above
in
the
smell
category
the
chocolates
are
not
very
rich
andor
potent
a
bit
of
charsmoke
as
well
body
is
thin
and
kinda
watery
but
it
holds
its
own
a
nice
light
feel
that
makes
for
a
smooth
ride
carb
is
low
i
still
kinda
like
this
stout
its
not
mindblowing
and
i
dont
have
the
urge
to
have
a
whole
pint
but
on
occasion
the
oysters
included
love
stout
is
good
for
a
small
gander
yards
love
stout
was
charcoal
black
with
a
very
fine
firm
mocha
head
served
on
nitrogen
it
looked
very
much
like
guinness
drraught
with
the
cascading
waterfall
of
tiny
bubbles
the
smell
was
faintly
chalky
with
dusty
roasted
grain
the
taste
was
chocolately
and
had
acidic
roast
at
first
that
progressed
to
a
pronounced
milk
caramel
candy
and
flowery
finish
the
beer
was
silky
smooth
with
tiny
soft
bubbles
d
tasty
version
of
a
good
style
one
that
can
be
a
little
bit
of
a
turnoff
for
the
bivalveaverse
or
a
turnon
for
the
amorous
wishing
to
experience
the
oysters
supposed
aphrodisiac
traits
i
just
got
the
love
stout
double
entendre
as
i
typed
this
review
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
at
this
one
certainly
its
worth
a
try
i
love
yards
beers
and
ill
surely
try
this
again
in
hopes
that
im
missing
something
here
or
that
whatever
i
believe
is
off
is
really
off
and
it
gets
worked
out
hopefully
i
can
get
to
try
it
from
a
bottle
while
its
around
this
season
d
putting
all
the
elements
together
this
brew
from
yards
goes
down
great
and
asks
that
you
have
another
definitely
something
to
give
a
try
d
an
ok
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
overall
but
nothing
overly
impressive
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
did
not
really
blow
me
out
of
the
water
not
too
shabby
even
if
you
dont
like
the
beer
you
cant
argue
that
this
isnt
true
to
style
as
for
me
ill
be
enjoying
the
one
i
have
and
perhaps
seeking
out
a
few
more
to
enjoy
down
the
line
the
bottom
line
is
that
yards
makes
good
exciting
beer
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
togo
from
the
craft
ale
house
for
around
2
poured
into
my
nonic
imperial
pint
glass
appears
a
dark
brown
color
akin
to
cola
with
a
fizzy
quickly
dissipating
head
to
match
the
nose
is
greeted
with
notes
of
sweet
molasses
chocolate
and
medium
roasted
grains
aroma
is
the
best
thing
this
stout
has
going
for
it
tastes
of
watered
down
mildly
roasted
grains
bitter
cocoa
maybe
some
very
watery
weak
coffee
has
a
seltzer
water
aftertaste
a
bit
thin
bodied
with
medium
to
moderate
carbonation
d
a
strong
point
of
this
beer
good
drinkability
low
alcohol
good
for
cooking
with
i
went
through
a
case
with
ease
despite
my
disappointment
about
the
lack
of
oysters
yards
bring
the
oyster
stout
back
i
would
think
that
trying
this
beer
on
cask
would
be
excellent
and
i
am
going
to
seek
that
out
d
best
yards
offering
ive
had
to
date
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
a
stout
can
really
come
to
life
with
cask
conditioning
very
nicely
done
and
one
of
my
standouts
from
philly
beer
week
pours
black
aromas
of
smooth
roasted
malts
slight
chocolate
very
even
and
mellow
flavor
begins
with
malts
mellow
simple
some
hints
of
chocolate
slightly
sweet
molasas
in
the
background
no
alcohol
presence
end
is
slightly
dry
with
little
to
no
bitterness
smooth
in
the
mouth
medium
body
brew
drinkability
i
had
4
over
4
hours
its
a
wonderful
easy
drinking
stout
with
a
mellow
array
of
flavors
that
say
yes
ill
have
another
great
cask
beer
very
different
for
a
stout
although
i
thought
the
sour
taste
was
a
little
overpowering
and
overshadowed
a
lot
of
the
other
flavors
in
this
beer
wasnt
bad
but
relative
to
other
stouts
this
one
ranked
low
on
the
drinkability
meter
for
me
i
had
this
one
on
draught
the
other
week
and
it
seemed
much
different
richer
more
stoutlike
was
not
in
a
position
to
review
though
allinall
id
say
that
this
is
the
carmen
electra
of
beers
nice
look
questionable
taste
d
rich
and
roasty
though
i
truly
loved
the
version
w
oyters
in
the
boil
it
had
a
better
feel
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
session
strength
stout
that
went
well
w
my
ancho
honey
bourbon
glazed
chicken
for
a
stout
it
looks
good
a
nice
rich
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
is
the
key
however
it
wasnt
filling
or
thick
roasted
malts
strong
coffee
an
a
slight
chocolate
aroma
are
present
at
first
smell
when
you
take
your
first
sip
you
can
taste
all
three
coming
through
strong
it
wasnt
a
heavy
stout
like
said
before
that
could
have
made
it
fuller
in
feel
it
was
a
thin
feel
when
sipped
and
very
easy
to
go
down
wo
any
creamy
residue
left
behind
in
your
mouth
i
feel
that
it
was
lacking
something
this
time
around
well
i
brought
a
growler
full
home
to
enjoy
and
it
was
the
same
will
i
get
a
pint
again
yes
but
a
growler
i
dont
know
dsessionable
for
sure
not
a
bad
effort
just
not
something
that
i
would
crave
to
drink
multiples
of
d
not
really
comparable
to
other
bigger
stouts
but
a
very
enjoyable
sessionable
darker
stout
like
beer
ive
had
some
issues
with
consistency
in
these
recently
but
still
recommended
for
something
easier
drinking
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
one
to
two
finger
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
with
a
hint
of
smoke
and
coffee
the
taste
is
a
little
less
amazing
compared
to
the
expectations
coming
from
the
smell
and
appearance
theres
definitely
a
roasted
malt
taste
as
well
as
smoke
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
lactose
the
taste
fell
off
fast
and
for
lack
of
a
better
word
became
almost
tasteless
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
velvety
which
makes
the
drinkability
better
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
at
the
bar
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
i
dont
know
what
the
love
in
here
is
but
im
not
a
fan
its
looks
nice
enough
with
a
pitch
black
body
and
it
smells
fine
with
big
roasted
grains
then
in
the
flavor
something
goes
wrong
again
theres
the
big
black
grains
along
with
a
distinctly
english
yeast
milk
or
creamlike
flavor
but
theres
an
awful
astringency
that
throws
it
all
off
and
makes
me
frown
and
put
my
glass
down
i
didnt
finish
this
one
almost
black
with
tan
two
finged
head
off
a
gernorus
pour
in
to
an
imperial
pint
through
the
roasted
darkness
you
can
see
tons
of
bubbles
tring
to
support
a
near
guinness
like
head
theres
tones
of
carbonation
and
a
supprising
hop
presance
with
a
bit
of
a
light
body
love
also
leaves
a
nice
lace
along
with
a
coffie
bitterness
id
try
this
one
again
esspically
if
i
could
find
it
on
draft
the
mouthfeel
is
again
english
in
character
fullbodied
but
not
super
thick
or
syrupy
a
distinct
creaminess
gives
way
to
a
lighter
finish
and
moderate
carbonation
semidry
with
just
a
faint
hint
of
warmth
booze
is
detectable
well
done
tasty
and
very
palatable
a
lower
abv
for
a
stout
and
easy
drinking
nature
makes
for
an
excellent
session
brew
i
thought
the
love
stout
was
a
decent
brew
but
there
are
many
other
stouts
that
i
would
choose
before
getting
to
this
one
pours
very
dark
with
a
small
amount
of
light
coming
through
very
minimal
tan
head
nose
is
very
mild
roasted
beans
flavor
is
not
very
interesting
a
bitter
hit
comes
at
you
first
and
there
is
a
decent
thick
malty
tone
that
gives
very
minor
hints
of
molasses
and
roasted
beans
feels
kind
of
thickly
syrup
like
on
the
tongue
seems
odd
to
me
this
is
an
easy
to
drink
stout
fairly
smooth
but
doesnt
bring
any
wild
or
interesting
character
to
the
table
d
one
of
the
most
easydrinking
stouts
ive
ever
had
one
of
the
most
flavorful
nonimperial
stouts
ive
ever
had
would
have
several
more
of
these
great
stuff
tried
this
at
the
steel
city
pour
last
night
its
a
very
nice
stout
with
an
excellent
dark
body
and
scent
that
leaves
a
nice
head
and
lacing
after
the
pour
its
not
as
strong
or
flavorful
as
it
could
be
but
was
still
a
nice
smooth
and
dark
stout
good
hints
in
the
smell
and
taste
of
chocolate
even
if
i
wish
they
were
a
bit
stronger
a
true
oyster
stout
one
of
the
few
available
on
the
market
this
is
a
bottle
aged
almost
two
years
in
my
beer
cellar
and
the
flavors
have
combined
beutifully
for
a
soft
easily
drinkable
stout
the
oysters
are
barely
noticable
except
as
something
different
about
this
stout
a
slightly
different
scent
and
flavor
then
the
usual
malt
chocolate
roasty
flovors
your
expecting
from
a
stout
but
even
knowing
its
oysters
clearly
labeled
on
the
bottle
its
not
what
id
expect
the
biggest
drawback
in
my
mind
is
the
overabundance
of
carbonation
which
gives
it
an
acidic
finish
certainly
a
beer
you
must
drink
from
a
glass
black
color
though
there
was
almost
no
head
present
when
served
to
me
in
a
pint
glass
good
aroma
with
some
roasted
malt
and
a
nice
chocolate
malt
backbone
nice
flavor
to
it
sweetness
was
spot
on
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
lightbodied
for
a
stout
but
it
made
it
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
orderbuy
this
again
but
there
are
several
stouts
i
would
pick
ahead
of
it
ontap
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
dark
dark
brown
nearly
black
with
everysosubtle
lighter
hints
a
nice
light
brownish
head
looks
pretty
good
nice
is
fairly
mild
mostly
coffee
nothing
too
much
else
of
not
taste
is
pretty
standard
stout
flavor
lots
of
roasted
malt
overall
some
mild
chocolately
hints
that
show
up
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
a
little
bit
of
lemon
that
catches
you
as
the
beer
fades
out
in
the
very
mild
hops
fairly
bitter
overall
overall
a
solid
if
not
particularly
noteworthy
taste
feel
is
surprisingly
thin
for
a
stout
good
carbonation
i
liked
but
didnt
love
this
beer
it
was
a
fairly
good
stout
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
im
not
the
biggest
stout
fan
and
this
one
isnt
one
id
necessarily
go
running
back
to
but
its
got
a
standard
flavor
that
wont
underwhelm
drinkability
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
stout
lately
as
far
as
stouts
are
concerned
ive
been
drinking
stronger
imperials
this
is
a
great
change
of
pace
beer
poured
hard
gave
a
thick
light
tan
head
aroma
of
roasted
and
burnt
malt
with
slight
coffee
essence
start
off
and
stay
a
good
bit
into
the
finish
not
much
hop
bouquet
coming
through
but
the
roasted
grains
smell
gets
the
saliva
flowing
appearance
is
opaque
black
but
not
too
thick
seeming
burnt
malt
flavor
is
quickly
turned
into
a
bitter
coffee
taste
that
is
pleasing
and
desirable
for
this
style
a
hint
of
bakers
chocolate
rounds
out
the
flavor
this
beer
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
has
moderate
to
low
carbonation
enjoyable
beer
with
my
salted
cashews
and
dark
chocolate
could
see
how
this
combination
could
get
the
love
flowing
excited
to
try
this
on
tap
next
nothing
exciting
a
good
tasty
stout
could
drink
a
few
of
these
enjoyable
treat
for
sipping
after
dinner
or
with
a
cigar
no
love
for
this
one
i
love
this
about
as
much
as
i
love
root
canal
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
very
middle
of
the
road
cheers
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
modest
head
that
lingers
nicely
sweet
nose
with
choclatey
notes
taste
shows
the
aforementioned
chocolate
with
good
body
not
too
full
has
a
clean
finish
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
a
good
stout
and
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
yards
tastes
dry
and
roasty
grainy
hops
are
light
and
grassy
mouthfeel
is
great
for
the
style
not
too
thick
this
is
a
stout
i
could
drink
all
day
wish
i
had
some
raw
oysters
to
pair
with
this
beerbeing
is
spoiling
me
with
these
pa
winner
brews
my
parents
visited
us
last
month
and
brought
a
sampler
case
of
yards
with
them
the
love
stout
was
the
first
one
i
tried
because
it
was
still
cold
outside
here
and
i
wante
a
heavy
beer
pours
dark
with
small
head
and
smells
normal
for
a
stout
roasted
malts
sweet
chocolate
mostly
what
is
memorable
about
it
is
the
vague
saltiness
that
makes
it
a
little
most
crisp
than
most
stouts
i
assume
the
saltiness
is
from
the
oysters
that
they
supposedly
put
in
the
brew
pot
but
others
have
said
that
they
no
longer
do
this
if
not
they
must
still
add
something
to
give
it
that
salt
flavor
anyway
i
like
it
enough
to
want
to
finish
the
ones
that
are
left
and
it
was
my
second
favorite
in
the
case
behind
their
fantastic
ipa
drinkability
a
very
pleasant
drinking
stout
which
would
benefit
from
a
bit
bigger
mouthfeel
not
for
everyone
but
i
like
it
overall
a
decent
brew
but
not
a
killer
one
the
saltiness
was
its
undoing
for
me
but
i
couldnt
tell
if
it
was
intentional
or
not
very
nice
and
drinkable
good
fireplace
beer
light
and
cool
enough
for
all
seasons
except
maybe
late
summer
this
goes
down
so
easily
i
think
if
there
were
a
light
stout
this
would
be
it
id
drink
it
again
appears
a
dark
almost
opaque
cocoa
cola
brown
forms
a
big
tan
head
leaves
behind
even
streaks
of
lacing
aroma
has
a
somewhat
mineral
character
to
it
im
guessing
this
is
due
to
the
oyster
shell
addition
to
the
boil
behind
that
is
an
herbal
hop
tone
with
dark
roasted
malts
bringing
about
cocoa
powder
and
bready
chocolate
notes
taste
has
a
smooth
even
flavor
faint
cocoa
touch
of
bitter
chocolate
the
roastiness
is
great
touch
of
mineral
bittering
hops
english
tradition
mellow
flavorful
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
evenly
carbonated
silky
smooth
im
sure
this
would
be
crack
on
cask
drinkability
definitely
a
wonderful
offering
from
yards
which
has
been
at
times
hit
and
miss
with
me
so
smooth
nice
and
refreshing
with
more
than
ample
enough
flavor
to
challenge
the
senses
this
beer
came
a
dark
black
with
a
brown
glow
to
it
with
no
head
at
all
smelled
of
dry
roasted
malts
with
an
underlying
sweet
and
sour
caramel
the
taste
starts
out
like
your
average
stout
with
a
mild
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
but
then
fades
into
what
i
can
only
call
hamburger
on
the
grill
im
getting
salted
and
seasoned
barbecued
beef
and
smoke
here
with
a
thin
underlying
nutty
sweetness
holly
crap
i
wish
i
was
eating
a
big
old
cheese
burger
with
this
beer
this
is
a
really
neat
and
well
done
flavor
the
mouth
feel
was
light
bodied
with
a
light
carbonation
that
helped
distribute
some
of
the
delicate
salty
flavors
of
the
beer
very
weird
but
surprisingly
delicious
this
poured
with
an
explosive
huge
dark
tanlight
brown
head
wow
the
color
was
a
dark
brown
like
a
caramel
colorcola
shade
the
nose
was
roasty
and
malty
it
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
good
roastedmalt
flavor
in
the
mouth
i
got
a
slight
charcoal
taste
on
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
be
offputting
as
it
warmed
i
also
picked
up
a
nice
anise
taste
in
the
mouth
overall
not
bad
but
not
really
a
summer
beer
alright
beer
once
its
poured
but
perhaps
not
worth
the
effort
drinkability

it
goes
down
pretty
quick
for
a
stout
because
of
the
light
mouthfeel
but
nothing
makes
love
stout
stand
out
for
me
to
get
more
good
for
an
everyday
stout
but
it
could
also
benefit
from
some
tweaking
body
is
a
little
thin
and
flavor
leaves
me
wanting
for
something
more
overall
a
good
stout
but
nothing
really
to
go
wild
over
ontap
yards
this
is
surely
a
nice
stout
a
very
dark
ruby
red
brew
that
nears
black
in
shade
the
lacing
is
nice
and
the
head
is
thick
and
consists
of
pure
white
froth
the
aromas
are
all
roasted
malts
heavy
chocolate
notes
a
bit
of
caramel
and
coffee
and
some
other
less
distinct
flavor
notes
are
in
the
mix
as
well
the
taste
is
very
roasty
and
malty
up
front
with
a
nice
chocolatelike
flavor
dominating
the
middle
palate
of
this
brew
the
finish
is
roasty
yet
again
and
coffee
hints
take
hold
in
the
finish
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
smooth
and
not
too
heavy
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
as
well
another
solid
yards
brew
the
beer
is
nearly
black
some
deep
scarlet
red
streaks
can
be
seen
against
light
the
head
is
light
brown
and
creamy
decent
size
and
retention
as
well
dusty
grain
cocoa
powder
and
a
little
vanilla
mix
in
on
the
nose
lacing
is
more
than
adequate
the
taste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
sour
light
vinegar
notes
are
a
bit
off
putting
behind
that
theres
some
decent
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
but
its
hard
to
get
at
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
carbonated
for
a
stout
but
not
overly
so
pretty
average
stuff
here
medium
light
body
definitely
looking
forward
to
more
of
these
drinkability
and
overall
the
best
ive
had
from
yards
yet
but
nothing
special
this
is
the
only
one
of
theirs
i
could
make
into
a
session
brew
well
a
wellbalanced
but
average
stout
hmm
so
this
is
an
oyster
stout
pours
dark
but
i
can
see
light
through
it
nice
thich
brown
head
appears
light
in
body
has
all
the
normal
stout
aromas
with
the
addition
of
a
slightly
salty
seaair
smell
tastes
of
chocolate
dark
toasted
malts
has
a
slight
sweetness
to
it
has
a
distinct
seasalt
flavor
from
the
whole
oysters
but
not
fishy
or
overpowering
very
light
mouthfeel
finishes
malty
and
nutty
this
is
good
dont
let
the
oyster
thing
turn
you
off
it
works
a
very
dark
brown
stout
actually
pretty
much
black
because
the
only
time
brown
is
visable
is
when
held
up
to
the
light
has
a
big
brown
head
the
aroma
is
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
slight
hint
of
vanilla
back
in
there
somewhere
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
nice
bittersweet
chocolate
character
but
is
washed
away
by
the
watery
mouthfeel
then
as
some
sort
of
delayed
reaction
there
is
a
strange
bitterness
that
appears
at
the
back
of
your
throat
i
open
the
beer
and
the
head
rushes
to
the
top
i
have
to
sip
some
to
hold
it
back
it
pours
a
deep
brownlight
black
color
but
the
tan
head
is
huge
so
i
have
to
wait
a
bit
smell
is
weak
but
i
get
some
sweet
chocolate
and
maybe
some
roasted
coffee
flavors
the
taste
begins
with
a
nice
semisweet
chocolate
flavor
but
in
the
middle
i
pick
up
on
a
saltiness
theres
a
saltysour
mix
that
is
really
throwing
me
off
i
cant
even
finish
this
beer
bc
of
this
flavor
it
seriously
almost
reminds
me
of
seaweed
or
the
ocean
but
not
in
a
good
way
really
weird
and
really
not
my
thing
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
pours
carbonated
and
with
a
tan
head
that
has
a
little
staying
power
smells
of
burnt
malt
and
a
little
fruityness
has
a
decent
body
a
little
thin
and
over
carbonated
for
a
stout
methinks
tastes
like
it
smells
and
has
a
lasting
after
taste
that
blooms
of
chocolate
maltiness
and
some
fruitness
not
a
must
have
but
it
will
be
add
to
my
usual
rotation
went
well
with
a
hefty
steak
and
with
veggies
and
roasted
pork
i
did
seem
a
little
thinner
than
expected
however
this
is
the
quality
that
made
it
seem
well
rounded
and
more
useful
even
though
it
coats
well
it
also
finishes
clean
taste
too
is
distinctly
salty
blending
with
the
sharp
carbonation
for
an
almost
vinegarlike
feel
in
the
mouth
slightly
sour
black
cherry
juice
aftertaste
holds
roasted
flavors
on
the
bitter
carbon
side
flavor
is
brief
and
body
is
very
smooth
and
a
bit
shallowwhich
brought
down
the
taste
somewhat
12
ounce
bottle
according
to
the
label
an
oyster
beer
the
best
beer
with
oysters
i
have
tasted
to
date
a
great
stout
smooth
would
be
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
black
as
night
appearance
but
little
head
great
stout
taste
with
little
astringency
the
velvety
smoothness
of
this
beer
gives
it
a
great
drinkability
there
is
an
underlying
but
subtle
complexity
in
the
taste
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
hard
to
describe
overall
i
really
liked
this
local
brew
and
would
love
to
have
another
ng
completely
lacks
character
if
i
were
to
drink
this
blindfolded
id
be
hard
pressed
to
lable
this
a
stout
unremarkable
and
disappointing
black
but
light
comes
in
easily
at
the
edges
the
light
tan
head
is
slightly
sandy
and
fades
to
a
thin
lacey
film
the
aroma
is
charcoal
and
walnuts
the
acidic
roastiness
comes
across
a
little
harsh
the
flavor
explodes
with
the
acidic
burnt
malt
almost
covering
up
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
a
notquite
nuttiness
follows
up
with
a
light
lingering
bitterness
finishing
it
off
the
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
beef
up
the
body
of
this
stout
and
youd
have
an
excellent
stout
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
big
ol
2
of
latteshaded
head
which
laced
and
laced
everywhere
over
the
opaque
dark
dark
brownblack
brew
head
lasts
and
lasts
with
a
little
mountain
of
foam
stacked
int
he
middle
of
the
glass
aroma
is
lightly
of
deep
dark
malts
with
some
hops
in
the
mix
taste
is
dark
malts
coffee
primarily
and
the
bitterness
associated
with
those
malts
sweetness
does
offset
the
bitterness
somewhat
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
for
the
taste
and
appearance
kind
of
odd
in
that
way
nothing
detrimental
though
and
the
drinkability
is
quashed
somewhat
by
the
lack
of
a
smooth
character
but
you
gotta
love
the
lacing
wow
nice
basic
and
simple
i
liked
it
drinkability
is
good
i
think
the
strange
taste
might
get
to
one
after
a
few
of
these
but
id
put
this
with
oysters
before
any
other
stout
maybe
not
delicious
but
unique
for
sure
thanks
to
beerluvr
for
providing
the
yards
sampler
i
hate
to
beat
a
dead
horse
but
yards
love
stout
is
not
a
beer
that
i
found
to
be
enjoyable
maybe
it
was
the
oysters
but
something
did
not
agree
with
my
taste
buds
at
all
it
is
black
with
ruby
highlights
it
is
not
too
dark
for
a
stout
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
of
burnt
malts
and
espresso
comes
to
mind
there
is
a
grape
like
tannin
feel
to
the
beer
as
well
it
is
overcarbonated
it
is
good
and
finishes
dry
but
i
would
have
exopected
to
be
fuller
in
body
and
a
little
creamier
as
the
carbonation
was
a
little
harsh
the
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
for
a
stout
and
is
dry
on
the
tongue
the
roasted
tones
and
dryness
last
on
the
tongue
after
swallowing
drinkable
but
there
are
some
more
flavorful
and
thicker
stouts
out
there
pours
dark
with
a
small
head
that
hangs
around
to
lace
the
glass
smells
of
toasted
grains
has
a
kind
of
bite
but
i
like
it
along
with
the
yeast
and
dryness
some
hop
flavor
but
more
smokey
with
the
smallest
hint
of
saltiness
maybe
from
the
oysters
overall
a
pleasant
brew
i
drink
it
regularly
and
will
continue
to
do
so
a
good
stout
offering
from
yards
a
brewery
which
may
be
the
most
underrated
in
pa
a
treat
for
those
who
like
the
dry
stout
character
and
certainly
one
that
i
would
have
again
poured
a
deep
dark
black
with
few
brownish
ruby
highlights
observable
when
held
to
the
light
creamy
tan
head
the
lasted
the
whole
glass
superb
retention
full
aroma
of
dry
dark
roasted
barley
overcarbonation
yields
a
slightly
thinnish
mouthfeel
too
spritzy
for
stout
dry
roasted
flavor
slightly
acidic
and
yeasty
hops
are
there
for
balance
and
not
a
whole
lot
more
i
found
this
brew
more
appetizing
to
look
at
and
smell
than
to
actually
drink
still
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
dry
stout
style
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
not
very
complex
but
drinkable
and
a
good
mix
of
the
nice
flavors
that
are
present
this
one
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
reddish
tint
to
it
thick
tan
head
that
went
down
pretty
quickly
fairly
decent
chocolate
and
coffe
aroma
with
some
malt
sweetness
also
medium
bodied
and
fairly
smooth
taste
chocolate
and
coffe
flavors
with
some
roastiness
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
maybe
the
oysters
add
calcium
but
im
sure
glad
i
didnt
taste
any
in
there
just
what
we
dont
need
fishy
beer
good
but
nothing
special
this
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
decent
lacing
almost
opaque
it
was
rather
difficult
getting
any
light
through
it
to
see
the
actual
shade
smells
wonderful
nice
roasted
aroma
some
seem
to
peek
out
definately
some
chocolate
i
think
im
gonna
love
this
oh
man
im
not
even
sure
how
to
describe
this
odd
flavors
going
on
here
not
bad
just
a
wierd
mix
a
light
hops
bite
right
at
the
front
mixing
with
what
i
assume
are
the
oysters
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
they
make
a
bold
statement
fading
from
that
into
a
bitter
chocolate
and
espresso
roasted
malt
interesting
aftertaste
not
as
good
as
it
smells
but
not
bad
either
full
bodied
but
dry
cloying
even
viscous
clings
to
everything
leaving
you
wanting
another
drink
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
this
out
with
fervor
like
im
going
to
be
doing
with
one
particular
bif
brew
i
got
but
if
this
is
ever
available
in
my
area
i
would
probably
pick
up
a
sixer
every
now
and
then
not
a
bad
brew
just
not
an
every
day
brew
it
smells
so
good
i
could
just
sit
here
and
smell
the
rest
of
it
love
stout
pours
jet
black
but
not
entirely
opaque
it
has
a
thin
whitish
head
that
remains
over
the
beer
over
time
smell
is
a
bit
like
chestnut
or
other
roasted
smell
and
rather
faint
start
is
smooth
clean
heavy
the
brew
is
fullbodied
with
slight
caramel
and
heavy
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
finish
is
also
very
smooth
and
rich
almost
like
a
creme
overall
this
stout
feels
very
dry
smooth
and
heavy
on
the
tongue
throat
and
stomach
love
stout
leaves
the
mouth
parched
and
seeking
more
liquid
not
a
bad
way
to
sell
more
beer
i
must
admit
a
good
stout
to
be
sure
and
definately
one
ill
be
looking
for
in
the
future
i
know
some
peaople
have
issues
with
conscistency
of
this
brew
but
to
me
it
is
always
a
delight
it
feels
great
in
the
mouth
very
thick
very
strong
almost
a
meal
the
overall
experience
is
less
than
i
had
wished
because
i
was
really
pumped
to
try
it
after
reading
about
it
it
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
a
very
pleasant
stout
with
excellent
maltiness
the
flavor
seems
a
little
weak
at
first
but
gains
speed
quickly
finishing
rich
and
complex
thick
syrupy
pour
wiht
an
extremely
creamy
beige
head
the
aroma
is
heavily
smoky
with
hints
of
chocolate
malt
the
flavors
build
on
the
aroma
with
a
predominant
smoked
malty
flavor
paired
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
and
toffee
notes
a
heavier
bitterness
flows
throughout
the
brew
a
harsh
carbonation
takes
away
from
the
whole
of
the
experience
but
overall
a
boldly
flavorful
ale
taste
was
black
malt
bitter
a
dark
earthy
bitter
held
up
by
some
deeply
dark
malt
behind
it
all
had
moderate
but
present
roast
flavors
strong
fruity
notes
as
well
with
a
surprising
brightness
and
assertiveness
to
it
but
they
were
only
quick
notes
long
finish
was
lightly
dry
but
with
quiet
espressolike
bitter
fruits
but
of
course
less
powerful
than
actual
espresso
good
complexity
to
it
for
a
regular
not
imperial
stout
a
bit
watery
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
good
but
uneven
and
though
complex
it
was
not
inviting
regardless
if
its
on
tap
this
fall
ill
order
it
it
looks
exactly
what
i
whought
it
would
look
like
black
in
color
with
a
tan
head
everything
else
was
a
complete
surprise
to
me
the
aroma
is
roasted
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
cardimom
seed
i
sensed
some
alcohol
in
the
aroma
as
well
which
seems
a
bit
odd
since
this
wasnt
really
a
big
beer
the
taste
is
roasty
and
chocolately
with
some
coffee
taste
not
very
sweet
at
all
i
was
expecting
a
beer
called
love
stout
as
being
sweet
and
its
listed
under
milk
stout
on
this
site
not
a
bad
thing
just
not
what
i
expected
this
seems
to
have
the
characteristics
of
an
imperial
stout
but
with
a
lower
alchohol
content
real
nice
poura
ink
black
color
with
nice
bigstickyrocky
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
medicinal
and
chocolaty
taste
is
like
milk
chocolate
and
creamywith
some
slight
burnt
notes
a
real
nice
brew
iam
glad
i
got
it
i
wanna
try
this
on
tap
sometimewill
look
for
it
next
winter
this
beer
poured
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
color
the
large
head
was
a
creamy
tan
there
is
faint
hints
of
roasted
malt
chocolatecocoa
and
fermented
fruits
the
flavor
is
similar
with
an
added
pumpernickel
breadiness
to
it
flavors
enhance
as
the
beer
warms
up
finishes
very
dry
and
peppery
theres
a
detectable
alcohol
presence
also
there
is
something
unique
to
this
stout

maybe
its
the
fact
that
oysters
are
added
directly
to
the
boil
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
this
beer
has
a
distinct
and
unique
flavor
a
nice
body
on
this
one
not
a
real
petite
little
thing
by
any
means
which
is
usually
my
type
this
one
is
a
full
figured
dynamo
im
not
sure
i
can
handle
as
i
taste
her
i
am
slightly
let
down
but
only
for
an
instance
i
realize
this
isnt
that
airbrushed
beauty
on
the
guiness
poster
instead
this
is
a
real
live
stout
no
airbrushing
to
hide
the
imperfections
yes
it
has
a
nice
burnt
malt
flavor
and
is
very
creamy
but
wasnt
this
supposed
to
be
a
sweet
stout
doesnt
seem
to
match
up
to
that
mackesons
i
saw
in
the
centerfold
but
maybe
i
am
holding
this
one
up
to
too
high
of
standards
maybe
i
should
except
her
for
who
she
is
a
very
nice
looking
and
tasting
stout
that
would
be
a
nice
stout
to
take
out
againdrinkability
and
even
bring
home
to
mom
still
she
is
not
one
of
the
hottest
stouts
ive
seen
not
a
bad
first
date
though
we
almost
made
a
love
connection
this
is
an
interesting
brew
the
first
impression
from
the
nose
leads
you
to
believe
that
you
have
stumbled
upon
a
sweet
stout
however
the
taste
is
very
complex
there
are
sweet
notes
but
also
very
rich
and
dry
tastes
that
impart
a
dry
or
imperial
stout
the
hops
are
hard
to
pinpoint
there
is
so
much
dark
malt
that
the
hops
do
not
really
shine
through
this
beer
is
brewed
with
oysters
in
the
brewkettle
to
add
a
mineral
component
that
seems
to
be
what
balances
out
the
sweet
milk
stout
characteristics
this
stout
is
by
far
the
most
unique
stout
i
have
ever
had
the
opportunity
to
taste
as
you
move
towards
the
middle
of
the
beer
you
are
almost
certain
that
you
are
drinking
an
imperial
stout
with
a
very
balanced
and
deep
rich
flavor
at
5
alcohol
this
is
an
impressive
stout
in
todays
culture
of
high
octane
imperials
by
the
end
of
the
beer
the
sweetness
is
all
but
gone
i
will
definately
check
this
out
again
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
toffee
colored
edging
there
is
virtually
no
head
the
aroma
is
caramalized
sugar
that
is
just
a
bit
burnt
a
bit
of
bourbonesque
alcohol
notes
and
some
roasted
malt
sweetness
a
hint
of
chocolate
slides
in
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
espresso
on
the
finish
just
enough
bitterness
is
present
to
clean
up
the
sweetness
between
drinks
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
a
bit
lacking
in
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
excellent
as
this
beer
goes
down
way
too
easy
ill
definitely
pick
up
some
more
of
these
in
the
future
prost
taste
was
sharp
coffee
bitterness
at
the
start
with
smooth
milky
sweetness
following
slightly
slick
bittersweet
chocolate
flavor
backs
everything
up
the
mouthfeel
is
oily
but
rather
light
not
very
much
weight
from
the
mouthfeel
perspective
rather
thin
finishes
bittersweet
and
quick
overall
a
descent
stout
the
body
could
be
better
complexity
could
be
a
bit
better
as
well
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
what
really
shines
everything
else
is
just
above
average
well
i
did
not
love
this
one
it
was
a
decent
stout
but
it
was
thin
and
didnt
have
enough
flavor
for
me
i
have
heard
that
this
will
make
a
person
cry
on
cask
so
i
will
have
to
pay
a
few
buddies
a
visit
in
philly
black
in
color
with
a
thick
dark
tan
head
aroma
is
lightly
roasty
somewhat
salty
with
a
bitter
chocolate
undertone
first
impression
i
got
was
of
the
beers
being
a
bit
thin
maltdominated
with
a
fairly
nice
roasty
character
and
a
decently
bitter
finish
and
some
prunelike
fruit
notes
developing
midpalate
aftertaste
is
quite
nice
but
still
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
onedimensional
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
my
girlfriend
has
become
a
big
fan
of
this
stout
since
i
brought
a
case
back
to
school
has
a
bittersweet
chocolate
taste
light
carbonation
and
thinner
than
expected
body
aroma
is
that
of
coffee
and
chocolates
i
liked
this
brew
but
for
the
same
style
i
think
sam
adams
cream
stout
is
a
little
better
pours
out
black
with
brownish
edges
and
a
very
thin
dark
tan
head
nose
is
coffee
a
little
chocolate
the
flavours
here
are
dominated
by
the
coffee
characteristics
and
a
quite
strong
bitterness
what
i
found
curious
and
a
little
offputting
was
a
slight
sour
note
towards
the
end
of
the
mouthful
finishes
again
with
the
bitterness
smooth
over
the
tongue
carbonation
is
quite
low
this
is
bottle
conditioned
and
kind
of
a
thin
or
light
feel
also
shows
itself
good
but
that
sour
note
must
be
the
oysters
makes
me
think
that
its
not
for
constant
quaffing
cool
label

the
love

this
local
philly

nose
of
coffee

from
this
black
brew
thin
lace
atop
quite
malty
for
a
stout
with
the
sweetness
i
expected
of
a
milk
stout
however
there
is
a
nice
crisp
bitter
hop
finish
that
balances
quite
nicely
with
the
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
nothing
but
smooth
although
its
a
tad
thin
some
more
body
would
be
appreciated
but
this
is
a
quality
stout
i
look
forward
to
more
from
this
brewery

okay
given

no

thats
fine
i
dont
want
any
hops
in
this
kind
of
beer
just
enough
bitterness
though
so
its
not
cloying
overall
a
fantastic
beer
that
was
fresh
from
the
brewery
and
kept
cold
in
the
fridge
since
then
a
very
well
made
beer
very
good
not
overly
chocolate
flavored
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
dark
almost
black
color
nice
lacing
and
a
head
that
lasted
a
little
then
fades
to
a
thin
film
nice
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
having
on
a
cold
snowy
day
and
it
hit
the
spot
very
good
beer
all
around
lots
of
notes
of
dark
bitter
chocolate
a
very
nice
stout
and
a
lot
of
flavor
for
6
9
stout
this
is
certainly
love
stout
to
the
next
level
a
bit
sweeter
but
smoother
and
pretty
robust
the
chocolate
really
ends
a
nice
element
to
this
beer
also
i
aged
this
for
just
over
a
year
and
i
think
that
smoothed
thing
out
a
bit
certainly
wouldnt
call
this
a
blockbuster
but
the
chocolate
works
well
with
the
vanilla
and
light
espresso
mouthfeel
is
soft
smooth
and
long
and
drinkability
is
terrific
the
beer
is
just
a
bit
thin
on
the
palate
but
i
thought
that
was
ok
for
style
and
for
a
non
ba
stout
really
a
very
enjoyable
easy
drinking
stout
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
slight
off
white
head
plenty
of
lace
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
dark
malts
coffee
dark
bread
char
in
the
taste
cocoa
and
malt
agreeable
flavor
but
certainly
not
overly
chocolatey
mild
earthy
hops
that
bitter
the
beer
nicely
and
add
a
slight
acidity
that
pairs
well
with
the
chocolate
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
solid
carbonation
and
cocoa
in
the
finish
overall
a
nice
well
rounded
chocolate
stout
that
is
not
overdone
not
extreme
but
extremely
drinkable
overall
not
worth
8
99
a
bottle
enjoyable
drinking
stout
but
nothing
more
nothing
less
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
it
is
not
a
big
abv
at
6
9
but
the
overall
outstanding
qualities
make
up
for
it
excellent
three
finger
head
opaque
dark
color
chocolate
malts
and
vanilla
bean
on
the
palate
creamy
and
smooth
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
consistent
nutty
malty
finish
caramel
and
slight
hoppieness
great
lacing
down
the
beer
easy
to
drink
and
satifying
with
a
bit
of
late
cherry
tartness
great
for
cool
weather
sipping
yards
is
a
good
brewery
and
they
stack
up
well
with
the
many
great
pennsylvania
brewing
companies
o
its
ok
i
was
expecting
more
overall
a
tasty
vanilla
laden
chocolate
brew
a
rather
nice
drinker
and
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
get
a
chance
tasty
and
nearly
fulfilling
i
give
props
overall
good
sweet
chocolate
stout
enough
chocolate
to
be
noticed
but
not
take
center
stage
roasted
grains
balance
out
the
chocolate
overall
a
very
nice
dryer
sweet
stout
starts
sweet
then
dries
out
with
the
attenuation
and
bittering
hops
this
offering
ends
with
an
odd
sour
note
this
is
really
not
that
good
of
an
effort
o
great
stout
well
done
o
an
above
average
chocolate
stout
but
lacking
in
any
of
the
depth
youd
expect
from
a
stout
the
beer
poured
dark
into
a
pint
glass
almost
completely
opaque
a
good
bit
of
foam
which
was
a
lighter
color
than
i
expected
i
couldnt
smell
anything
there
was
something
there
but
it
was
too
faint
for
me
to
smell
the
taste
was
good
strong
chocolate
maybe
too
strong
for
some
palates
but
great
for
mine
some
cherry
notes
a
little
roasted
malt
no
alcohol
warmth
which
for
a
6
9
beer
is
good
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
malt
and
roastiness
to
go
with
the
strong
chocolate
taste
but
since
i
like
chocolate
i
happily
drank
the
beer
it
also
had
a
creamy
consistency
which
was
pleasant
d
an
exceptionally
drinkable
english
stout
im
a
big
fan
of
yards
and
this
offing
only
furthers
my
adoration
solidly
above
average
in
all
facets
and
teetering
on
exceptional
in
terms
of
aroma
and
flavor
the
6
9
abv
makes
this
one
an
easier
drinker
by
stout
standards
and
is
something
i
would
indulge
in
regularly
if
it
came
in
12oz
bottles
instead
of
bombers
regardless
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
a
bottle
up
next
time
you
see
it
you
wont
regret
it
d
this
was
a
decent
chocolate
stout
the
scent
and
taste
were
basic
but
good
the
body
was
weak
but
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
really
easy
to
drink
not
for
aging
more
likely
for
chugging
meh
overall
i
am
very
happy
i
finally
decided
to
buy
this
one
a
great
beer
that
is
hurt
a
little
bit
by
a
weak
mouthfeel
and
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
but
overall
one
that
i
would
easily
enjoy
again
in
the
future
ov
a
decent
stout
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
it
needs
a
fuller
richer
body
and
a
note
of
coffeeespresso
in
the
flavour
to
add
some
complexity
and
depth
and
round
it
out
more
i
know
its
a
chocolate
stout
and
theres
loads
of
chocolate
flavour
in
this
but
for
me
it
just
needed
another
dimension
to
earn
a
high
rating
o
delicious
easy
drinking
stout
with
some
complexity
and
depth
i
expected
more
body
from
this
beer
however
additionally
the
flavors
werent
very
rounded
sweet
on
the
front
roastiness
in
the
back
nonetheless
a
very
enjoyable
beer
o
its
not
the
most
complex
stout
by
any
stretch
however
the
way
it
delicately
balances
drinkability
with
a
rich
chocolate
flavor
just
impresses
the
hell
out
of
me
i
could
easily
crush
a
750
of
this
and
not
grow
tired
of
it
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
stout
because
it
had
tons
of
chocolate
flavors
but
was
easy
to
drink
because
it
wasnt
that
heavilybodied
the
taste
is
great
lots
of
roasted
stout
flavor
with
yeast
taste
that
has
a
light
mineral
and
dried
fruit
element
with
a
cocoa
taste
that
is
slightly
bittersweet
with
some
toasted
malt
flavor
balancing
with
light
spice
and
astringency
of
dark
grain
the
overall
flavor
is
excellent
and
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
i
would
probably
drink
this
anytime
it
is
avaiable
as
it
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
utterly
black
stout
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
roasted
coffee
and
aint
licorice
rotated
grains
the
taste
is
moderately
sweet
dark
fruit
almost
wine
like
at
times
mediumlight
in
body
dark
and
rich
in
flavor
some
spicy
hop
flavor
in
the
hindtaste
lightly
warming
this
is
a
welcomed
straightforward
beer
overall
an
enjoyable
chocolate
stout
slow
sipping
and
satisfying
o
chocolate
flavors
nicely
integrated
into
the
standard
love
stout
without
being
dominant
this
is
a
simple
chocolate
stout
a
nice
integration
of
flavors
well
made
all
around
wow
big
dissappiont
here
hardley
can
taste
the
vanilla
yes
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
but
i
cant
even
taste
chocolate
in
it
maybe
its
a
bad
bottle
but
this
is
a
waste
of
time
yes
a
very
dark
in
the
glass
but
thats
it
nothing
more
more
on
and
keep
looking
because
this
one
is
just
flat
o
another
solid
beer
from
yards
and
i
cant
wait
to
pick
up
more
great
balance
and
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
good
staying
power
that
left
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
powdery
dark
chocolate
aroma
is
dominant
with
sweet
roasted
malt
and
vanilla
notes
in
the
background
medium
bodied
with
a
thin
start
that
quickly
comes
alive
with
dense
rich
carbonation
similar
to
the
aroma
dry
dark
cocolate
flavor
up
front
with
roasted
malt
beneath
light
hop
bitterness
through
the
middle
that
rides
a
smooth
vanilla
wave
finishes
semidry
with
a
semisweet
chocolately
finish
very
refined
and
delicate
insanely
drinkable
i
like
this
a
lot
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
moderate
cap
of
tannish
tinted
froth
scent
brings
notes
of
dark
roasted
grain
and
ash
light
notes
of
cocoa
and
brine
taste
follow
suit
dry
and
ashy
on
the
palate
heavy
roast
and
powdery
dark
dry
cocoa
medium
to
full
bodied
dry
overall
decent
flavor
profile
but
not
to
heavily
chocolate
flavored
enough
to
overcome
the
roast
basically
this
is
yards
love
stout
aged
on
cocoa
nibs
so
all
the
goodness
plus
a
little
extra
chocolate
poured
opaque
black
with
a
thick
creamy
light
tan
head
exhibiting
excellent
lacing
and
retention
aroma
was
roasty
with
dark
malts
and
coffee
with
notes
of
cocoa
more
of
those
characteristics
in
the
taste
the
regular
version
of
this
beer
already
has
a
nice
chocolate
profile
and
the
added
aging
augmented
that
a
bit
but
it
wasnt
overdone
the
base
is
an
oyster
stout
so
some
hints
of
brine
can
be
picked
up
but
the
other
flavors
at
work
kind
of
push
that
into
the
background
smooth
and
creamy
medium
bodied
and
quite
a
nice
drink
overall

or
rather
chocolate
liquor
cream
i
cant
smell
any
other
thing
even
if
chocolate
is
not
really
that
pronounced
i
also
expected
a
thicker
body
taste
is
chocolate
liquor
cream
with
notes
of
dark
fruits
but
again
is
somehow
a
faint
one
its
really
pleasant
but
it
could
be
stronger
in
every
sense
but
ill
try
it
again
if
i
have
the
chance

httpabarwithnoname

com
quite
nice
the
chocolate
definitely
comes
across
the
taste
is
more
milk
chocolate
than
cocoa
and
rather
sweet
but
it
blends
nicely
with
the
roasted
malt
the
weakest
element
is
the
mouthfeel
which
ought
to
be
thicker
and
more
substantial
however
it
goes
down
nicely
enough
worth
trying
a
nice
beer
it
has
element
of
a
milk
stout
and
i
wish
it
had
the
body
of
an
oatmeal
stout
good
but
not
great
o
kind
of
a
disappointment
thats
what
i
get
for
being
a
sucker
for
advertising
the
chocolate
flavor
is
there
but
is
lacking
in
depth
overall
its
pretty
easy
drinking
which
makes
it
a
little
underwhelming
eh
ive
had
better
beers
from
meantime
this
is
a
pretty
insipid
one
with
the
chocolate
adding
little
more
than
gimmick
to
my
mind
o
a
chocolatey
beer
what
else
is
there
to
say
id
have
another
but
id
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
recommended
if
you
want
chocolate
beer
an
honest
label
interesting
overall
chocolate
but
no
sweetness
thats
a
leap
for
the
senses
this
brew
pours
a
dark
cherry
cola
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
straight
out
dutch
chocolatecoccoa
nibs
and
not
much
elseit
has
a
lightmedium
bodied
well
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
has
tastes
of
rich
dutch
chocolatelight
fruity
hopsdark
coccoa
nibsovaltine
and
milky
chocolate
and
overall
this
is
definately
a
dessert
brew
the
only
clear
taste
i
get
is
chocolate
and
even
though
im
a
chocolate
fan
there
is
a
fine
line
between
choc
and
beer
cheers
overall
nice
and
very
drinkable
chocolate
porter
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
to
sit
and
enjoy
on
its
own
probably
not
one
for
a
session
but
very
pleasant
good
effort
but
could
be
better
just
like
meantimes
london
porter
d
its
almost
like
a
liquor
but
not
too
thick
the
taste
is
just
rich
enough
that
you
can
sip
it
slower
while
its
still
light
enough
to
have
a
few
glasses
i
bought
this
beer
for
my
wife
to
have
because
the
bottle
looked
so
neat
i
decided
to
try
one
myself
mistake
not
the
best
stout
i
have
ever
had
and
one
i
will
not
volunteer
to
drink
again
m
mediumfull
body
a
nice
balance
you
dont
get
the
alcohol
at
all
d
highly
drinkable
which
is
what
i
expect
they
were
going
for
ontap
at
the
farmhouse
in
emmaus
8
for
a
snifter
not
oversized
the
beer
is
defined
by
a
clean
and
clear
dry
chocolate
flavor
there
are
hint
of
berries
and
caramel
but
for
the
most
part
this
beer
smells
and
taste
like
a
highend
dark
chocolate
though
its
not
terribly
dark
maybe
40
cocoa
its
almost
like
a
liquor
but
not
too
thick
the
taste
is
just
rich
enough
that
you
can
sip
it
slower
while
its
still
light
enough
to
have
a
few
glasses
i
think
its
a
meditation
beer
and
i
couldnt
figure
out
which
food
it
can
pair
with
maybe
its
better
to
taste
it
by
itself
d
a
very
drinkable
english
stout
theres
nothing
especially
memorable
about
this
one
but
there
is
something
that
makes
it
quaffable
and
slightly
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
would
gladly
drink
again
d
i
liked
not
loved
this
beer
i
will
drink
it
again
if
it
is
on
tap
but
i
am
not
going
to
seek
it
out

a

on

thin

with

a
bit
disappointed
as
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
chocolate
and
a
fuller
body
da
pretty
nice
beer
but
im
going
to
their
london
porter
the
next
time
with
meantime
that
beer
is
phenomenal
this
beer
is
just
ok
nothing
mind
blowing
here
just
an
easy
to
appreciate
and
drink
light
english
stout
or
porter
as
the
menu
at
tjs
stated
why
is
it
the
beers
that
have
chocolate
written
somewhere
on
the
label
are
the
ones
that
taste
the
least
like
chocolate
putting
the
chocolate
aside
just
as
a
stout
this
beer
is
a
little
lacking
there
is
a
touch
of
choclate
on
the
nose
but
it
isnt
defining
the
palate
is
a
little
uneven
and
lacking
in
direction
bitterness
is
mild
and
body
is
lightmedium
overall
drinkable
but
not
memorable
typical
stout
body
and
very
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
chocolate
stouts
ive
had
in
a
long
time
one
of
the
best
chocolate
porters
ive
sampled
very
well
made
and
judicious
use
and
combining
of
flavors
puts
this
over
the
top
the
experience
was
made
all
the
more
pleasant
as
i
was
cleaning
my
palate
with
pecan
pie
in
between
sips
a
match
made
in
valhalla
pours
a
deep
brown
with
white
head
very
little
lacing
smells
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
the
taste
has
some
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
vanilla
it
almost
tastes
like
a
chocolate
chip
cookie
very
sweet
and
delicious
smooth
mouthfeel
i
would
drink
this
anytime
as
a
dessert
beer
but
i
wouldnt
want
multiple
of
them
in
a
row

i
like
it
leans
more
toward
a
porter
than
a
stout
medium
spicy
mouthfeel
a
bit
light
though
not
watery
excellent
coffeeoat
chalkiness
in
the
finish
another
ba
said
that
you
cant
go
wrong
with
chocolate
beers
and
this
is
case
in
point
its
unspectacular
yet
so
damn
drinkable
theres
a
strong
and
enticing
cocoa
essence
and
the
beer
is
remarkably
balanced
a
tasty
quaffable
concoction
im
now
intrigued
by
what
meantime
has
to
offer
d
this
is
an
appreciable
stout
very
good
stuff
as
the
name
implies
chocolate
this
is
a
real
chocolate
beer
a
bit
to
sweet
to
drink
a
bunch
notes
not
as
chocolaty
as
the
nosename
but
still
a
decent
amount
of
chocolate
flavor
nice
porter
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
balanced
creamy
thick
black
body
with
a
slight
tan
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
milk
chocolatey
with
very
sweet
caramels
almost
sticky
sweet
a
bit
like
the
tia
maria
liqueur
initially
very
sweet
flavours
up
front
lots
more
chocolate
with
a
gradual
shift
towards
bitterness
at
the
end
this
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
which
makes
it
a
bit
hard
going
its
certainly
an
interesting
beer
and
is
brilliantly
crafted
like
all
meantime
beers
in
conclusion
this
dark
beer
is
a
wonderful
complement
to
the
dessert
as
an
after
dinner
drink
or
merely
for
those
selfindulgent
momments
by
the
fireplace
overall
im
impressed
with
this
beer
i
didnt
really
like
their
coffee
porter
but
this
chocolate
porter
kicks
booty
chocolate
is
a
good
beer
with
good
flavours
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
and
holds
up
quite
well
unfortunately
it
could
do
with
a
bit
more
flavour
but
it
does
a
better
job
at
the
being
a
chocolate
stout
than
youngs
double
chocolate
stout
aggressive
carbonation
d
a
good
beer
that
is
decent
as
a
sipping
beer
but
its
not
fantastic
and
if
you
are
willing
to
go
up
a
few
notches
concerning
abv
you
can
find
way
better
chocolate
stouts
but
of
course
this
is
just
an
english
stout
far
from
the
realm
of
imperial
stouts
overall
pretty
solid
stout
for
sure
but
the
taste
profile
doesnt
quite
deliver
the
chocolate
like
the
nose
advertises
it
could
also
be
a
bit
darker
in
color
and
heavier
on
the
palate
as
well
to
be
sure
i
quite
enjoyed
this
overall
it
drank
away
very
quickly
from
a
300
ml
bulletshaped
champagnelike
bottle
this
beer
is
utterly
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
the
head
is
wonderfully
stable
and
longlived
despite
the
warnings
on
the
bottle
to
serve
very
chilled
i
had
the
beer
at
slightly
above
cellar
temperature
the
aroma
is
enticing
immediately
noticeable
chocolate
accompanied
by
black
roasted
grain
theres
a
little
malt
vanilla
and
butter
aromas
as
well
the
butter
isnt
a
diacetyl
smell
but
seems
to
go
handinhand
with
the
chocolate
it
also
becomes
more
pronounced
through
the
glass
the
taste
is
surprisingly
semidry
and
nicely
bitter
i
guess
that
i
expected
more
sweetness
fairly
complex
taste
that
centers
on
the
chocolate
malts
and
roastedburnt
grain
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
medium
fullness
its
not
as
thick
as
it
could
be
all
in
all
theres
not
much
to
dislike
in
this
beer
it
seems
well
puttogether
and
is
an
interesting
brew
d
a
nice
interesting
beer
like
the
coffee
porter
its
something
id
drink
on
a
semiregular
basis
but
2
back

would
be

again
with

a

for

still
a

beer
good
aftertaste
d
much
more
chocolate
than

to
me
smell
makes
this

suffer
but
the

and
balanced
a

to
drink
while

as
it
says
on

my
700th
review
overall
an
excellent
chocolate
stout
well
worth
a
try
other
comments
smells
like
a
craft
soda
and
tastes
like
a
vanillaspiked
porter
the
vanilla
and
root
beer
notes
are
a
bit
heavy
in
the
nose
worth
a
try
i
guess
if
you
happen
to
stumble
upon
it
pretty
good
stuff
where
many
want
meantimes
london
stout
to
be
a
current
stout
i
dont
mind
is
simpler
elegance
and
its
regal
refinement
as
it
would
take
a
more
advanced
palate
to
appreciate
all
the
nuances
that
this
beer
provides
its
a
time
capsule
into
twohundred
years
ago
however
i
do
acknowledge
that
the
advancements
in
brewing
have
allowed
to
a
superior
brand
of
stout
in
todays
market
dark
brown
nearly
black
pour
with
just
a
tint
of
ruby
two
finger
caramelcolored
head
with
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
nose
has
some
solid
roast
with
hints
of
cocoa
coffee
leather
and
a
touch
of
smoke
the
taste
follows
suit
with
hints
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
tobacco
cocoa
and
smoke
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
but
a
bit
thin
for
a
stout
overall
a
solid
english
stout
but
nothing
too
special
this
is
so
much
fun
than
guinness
liked
the
more
intense
flavor
low
sweetness
and
a
hop
twist
you
do
not
see
on
the
mainstream
stouts
i
have
the
impression
they
intensify
this
brew
comparing
to
older
releases
a
fairly
typical
unexciting
stout
drinkable
but
not
one
id
particularly
want
to
have
again
nothing
outstanding
or
particularly
great
about
this
one
im
afraid
its
not
one
of
the
better
meantime
beers
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
is
drinkable
and
not
too
offensive
overall
not
very
good
this
is
a
big
step
down
from
their
porters
imo
its
more
like
a
watered
down
version
of
their
porter
and
yet
they
call
it
a
stout
i
would
call
it
a
mild
ale
almost
which
is
may
be
a
decent
beer
in
that
case
but
even
then
its
very
thin
and
watery
and
the
flavor
profile
is
muted
o
very
drinkable
indicated
to
coffee
lovers
overall
a
lovely
drinkable
classic
english
stout
love
it
dark
black
with
a
creamy
white
head
carbonation
is
moderate
and
the
texture
is
creamy
but
medium
bodied
flavours
include
chocolate
coffe
dark
fruits
and
roasted
grain
with
a
curious
bitter
mineral
finish
certainly
better
than
i
remember
the
bottled
version
and
scored
accordingly
just
lacking
a
little
body
i
reckon
i
could
down
a
pint
in
one
and
that
just
isnt
a
london
stout
now
is
it
overall
while
the
look
was
unappealing
especially
the
lousy
head
and
the
feel
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
nose
and
flavor
were
quite
enjoyable
this
one
shows
that
you
can
have
lots
of
nice
aroma
and
flavor
while
holding
to
a
lower
abv
an
enjoyable
brew
id
definitely
pick
up
again
recommended
overall
a
nice
stout
that
has
more
to
it
than
the
abv
of
4
5
would
have
you
believe
prefer
the
tap
version
to
the
bottled
version
which
was
tasted
about
a
year
ago
cheers
overall
although
the
beer
seemed
thin
and
boring
in
the
beginning
it
slowly
grew
and
developed
its
unique
flavour
but
sadly
there
was
only
one
bottle
excellent
session
beer
overall
a
rather
nice
stout
with
a
big
flavour
not
sure
how
true
it
is
to
an
original
london
stout
but
worth
seeking
out
to
try
meantime
has
better
beers
their
coffee
stout
this
is
a
rather
ordinary
porter
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
light
and
watery
beer
flavor
and
aroma
smoky
and
porto
wine
the
formation
of
foam
is
low
with
a
short
duration
smooth
it
has
good
drinkability
compared
to
its
competitors
in
this
style
i
expected
more
d
a
very
good
exampole
of
the
style
quite
drinkable
since
its
watery
and
not
overly
flavorful
not
a
great
brew
to
be
honest
but
could
settle
for
worse
the
smokiness
makes
it
sort
of
interesting
bummer
the
aroma
doesnt
exist
cant
smell
anything
the
taste
is
the
same
with
hardly
any
flavor
and
its
way
to
watery
all
you
can
taste
is
a
little
hops
d
the
drinkability
is
very
good
w
easy
sessioning
stout
qualities
a
bit
slick
feel
which
has
lighter
bodied
effect
but
to
be
expected
for
a
session
strength
english
stout
recommended
drinkability
another
good
beer
from
meantime
heavy
and
full
flavoured
even
given
the
low
abv
nice
head
and
delicate
subtle
aroma
alas
the
taste
whilst
pleasant
is
nothing
special
lacking
something
in
depth
and
character
i
liked
it
more
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
i
have
been
going
off
this
of
late
drinkability
is
average
as
well
but
i
do
think
i
want
to
try
it
again
just
to
get
a
better
feel
for
it
this
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
one
finger
chocolate
brown
head
to
it
very
nice
head
retention
leaving
spotty
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
of
coffee
chocolate
caramel
malts
some
toffee
and
toasted
malts
taste
is
heavy
on
the
roastedtoasted
malts
up
front
then
coffee
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
hit
you
the
finish
lends
to
caramel
and
toffee
flavoring
with
the
tiniest
touch
of
hops
for
bite
this
is
lighter
bodied
with
higher
carbonation
i
was
utterly
shocked
with
just
how
light
this
beer
was
crisp
on
the
tongue
with
a
creamier
finish
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
beer
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
blackishbrown
color
ruby
hues
if
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
a
dense
tan
with
tightly
packed
bubbles
great
roasted
grain
aroma
coffee
and
cocoa
and
a
little
burnt
woodlike
character
the
smell
though
besides
the
roast
is
quite
clean
the
taste
is
dry
and
full
of
roasted
malt
and
barley
flavors
the
malt
comes
first
with
a
hightly
roasted
sensation
not
quite
burnt
not
much
hop
flavor
and
very
little
bitterness
just
for
balance
i
think
that
more
bitterness
comes
from
the
roast
than
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
disappointingly
light
a
bit
too
watery
if
the
light
body
is
for
drinkability
i
think
it
was
overdone
a
little
more
heft
would
have
added
a
lot
to
the
experience
still
this
is
a
very
flavorful
stout
md
the
texture
proves
slightly
too
fizzy
for
my
palate
while
the
light
body
and
an
evolving
blackmalt
flavour
profile
have
nevertheless
rendered
a
decent
drinkability
alls
wellbalanced
alls
delicious
for
an
english
stout
with
or
without
wheat
onlymalt
or
80
malt
this
dark
ale
evinces
meantimes
craftsmanship
yet
one
more
time
in
my
opinion
this
bottleconditioned
ale
or
pasteurised
but
nonfiltered
like
a
hefeweizen
could
well
be
really
irresistible
if
the
carbonation
was
much
milder
like
a
true
real
ale
overall
a
pretty
decent
stout
although
maybe
a
little
rough
round
the
edges
recommended
though
d
apart
from
the
apple
note
in
the
smell
this
is
a
top
drop
quite
a
sessionable
stout
some
fresh
plump
oysters
went
down
nicely
while
sipping
this
drinkability
average
not
subtle
at
all
which
hurts
drinkability
when
the
flavors
happen
to
be
so
intense
this
is
available
in
grocery
stores
and
dépanneurs
in
quebec
i
e
pretty
easy
to
get
even
when
coming
over
the
river
from
ottawa
i
know
this
is
a
stout
but
it
really
reminded
me
of
a
porter
i
e
a
little
bit
thinner
body
totally
drinkable
good
taste
could
become
a
winter
standby
overall
very
average
could
be
used
as
a
gateway
for
the
guinness
drinker
always
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
boréale
i
only
wish
i
could
buy
it
here
at
home
overall
not
bad
seems
more
like
a
porter
could
easily
have
again
a
pleasant
surprise
bought
randomly
in
a
quebecois
grocery
store
and
definitely
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
the
appearance
is
jet
black
and
the
little
head
you
get
has
no
retention
or
lace
the
smell
is
of
chocolate
and
spoiled
milk
it
has
a
sweet
taste
for
a
stoutvery
little
bitter
notes
like
others
in
the
style
it
pairs
well
with
chocolate
and
spiced
nuts
i
could
have
two
but
no
more
than
that
not
a
session
stout
d
a
good
drinker
the
beer
is
very
opaque
with
a
finger
white
head
and
good
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
is
surprisingly
on
the
absinthe
side
but
slight
malts
and
little
hops
could
also
be
detected
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
yet
true
to
the
style
also
very
dry
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
a
good
example
of
a
stout
try
it
if
you
are
ever
in
quebec
overall
a
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
stout
interesting
brew
some
amazing
stregnths
starting
with
the
highly
persistant
head
creamy
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
but
the
flavor
is
a
little
unusual
this
brew
has
a
malty
anise
or
licorice
taste
with
some
sweetness
and
very
little
hops
didnt
get
much
in
the
aroma
department
i
suspect
this
is
one
beer
you
either
love
or
hate
put
me
in
the
love
category
notes
from
092206
d
very
high
i
wouldnt
have
any
problem
to
drink
a
six
pack
of
those
and
asking
for
more
the
flavor
makes
up
for
the
lack
of
aroma
some
coffee
flavors
with
a
touch
of
cocoa
the
body
is
way
too
thin
for
the
style
this
is
a
flavorful
stout
but
is
not
world
class
overall
better
than
what
i
remembered
actually
this
is
pretty
darn
good
i
suspect
that
i
never
had
it
warm
enough
to
really
unleash
the
flavors
beats

this
one
went
down
very
quickly
without
me
noticing
a
good
local
alternative
to
guinness
not
really
that
many
widely
distributed
stouts
in
quebec
but
not
up
to
a
comparison
with
stambroise
a
very
nice
commercial
stout
one
of
the
best
in
canada
in
a
bottle
santé
black
in
color
with
thin
dark
tan
head
the
aroma
is
rich
and
dominated
by
a
deep
roasty
malt
the
body
is
surprisingly
full
with
a
slight
hint
of
dark
fruit
turning
gently
roasty
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
fizzy
at
points
however
and
overall
not
quite
what
i
expected
from
the
style
but
not
horrible
licorice
is
the
dominant
aroma
with
some
roasted
nut
notes
the
flavor
begins
with
a
light
malt
but
the
aftertaste
explodes
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
a
bit
thin
bodied
and
could
use
more
flavor
from
start
to
finish
but
this
is
still
one
worth
trying
if
youve
never
had
it
before
serviceable
stout
though
too
carbonated
and
a
bit
thin
black
with
thin

and

taste
malts
right
there
making
it

all
the

some

malt
coffee
and
burnt
attempt

fine
with

roast

and
chocolate

are
felt
after
the

thanks
to
rastacouere
for
sending
me
this
one
i
agree
wholeheartedly
with
phyl21ca
this
is
very
underrated
real
black
brew
with
sweet
coffee
taste
pourred
a
very
large
black
head
very
nice
look
not
too
mucy
body
and
not
too
complex
but
still
very
enjoyable
the
bitterness
level
is
appropriate
i
think
this
beer
is
very
underrated
the
draught
version
is
more
enjoyable
then
the
bottle
version
but
still
very
good
this
is
good
its
much
better
than
i
remembered
the
toffee
and
chocolate
dominate
but
without
being
oversweet
or
cloying
very
well
done
it
pours
out
suitably
black
with
only
a
little
tan
head
the
smell
is
mostly
chocolate
malts
with
some
coffee
bitterness
as
well
taste
leans
more
towards
a
coffee
flavour
with
subtle
caramel
sweetness
and
again
touches
of
chocolate
before
the
slightly
bitter
finish
carbonation
is
fairly
energetic
giving
boreale
a
lighter
feel
than
most
stouts
but
also
adding
some
peppery
feel
on
the
tongue
its
certainly
a
good
beer
not
outstanding
but
nice
to
drink
the
extra
alcohol
and
carbonation
cause
it
to
trend
towards
a
dark
ale
but
the
taste
is
deadon
stout
3c
average
is
this
a
real
thing
did
i
miss
the
memo
its
malted
chocolate
soda
its
interesting
though
there
are
some
good
aromas
and
flavors
here
unfortunately
there
are
some
notable
issues
with
the
mouthfeel
dry
and
roasty
yet
fizzy
and
seltzerlike
not
bad
but
far
from
great
oa
nice
beer
as
it
warms
it
doesnt
seem
to
improve
which
i
found
odd
for
a
stout
nothing
special
and
i
will
probably
never
try
this
beer
again
this
stout
is
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
with
a
burger
i
would
imagine
it
would
be
just
as
good
with
a
steak
with
such
low
alcohol
one
could
easily
drink
several
in
an
afternoon
overall
this
one
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
mouthfeel
was
medium
which
was
the
biggest
bummer
of
all
from
this
brew
when
drinking
a
stout
i
dont
want
to
sense
any
wateryness
to
it
unfortunately
this
was
it
wasnt
bad
just
basic
and
i
wouldnt
have
had
more
than
a
sample
the
flavor
is
closer
to
dry
the
body
is
quite
thin
for
the
style
and
the
very
high
carbonation
exasperates
this
feature
short
aftertaste
of
weak
coffee
o
had
some
of
the
right
flavor
components
and
while
i
applaud
cbc
for
making
a
nice
simple
stout
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
the
cpj
an
ok
stout
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
porter
poured
heavy
dark
brown
to
black
with
some
head
aroma
was
of
malts
and
slightly
stale
coffee
and
the
taste
was
similar
not
too
potent
in
the
taste
department
medium
mouthfeel
not
necessarily
watery
but
not
quite
what
i
look
for
in
a
stout
drinkability
is
good
decent
tasting
beer
that
is
quite
easy
to
drink
dsolid
and
well
constructed
yet
simple
unassuming
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
type
of
beer
you
could
have
around
and
use
as
your
go
to
stout
overall
an
interesting
stout
with
a
bevy
of
interesting
flavors
worth
a
try
drinkability
would
not
buy
again
drinkability
at
4
6
this
is
highly
flavorful
and
pretty
damn
sessionable
especially
as
fall
is
upon
us
one
of
cooperstowns
best
if
not
the
best
ill
be
picking
up
a
case
of
this
as
soon
as
i
can
the
mouthfeel
and
odd
taste
issues
give
this
brew
a
less
than
desirable
drinkability
im
afraid
it
wasnt
a
drain
pour
for
me
but
polishing
it
off
got
a
bit
difficult
at
the
end
strike
out
stout
starts
off
promising
like
a
30
count
but
whiffs
on
some
high
cheese
and
offspeed
stuff
before
finally
getting
punched
out
looking
presented
in
a
standard
pint
glass
this
beer
required
a
couple
minutes
to
settle
due
to
an
extremely
foamy
head
after
settling
to
a
more
manageable
head
it
quickly
dissipated
with
no
lacing
pitch
black
even
in
the
light
the
nose
is
very
subtle
some
barely
malt
comes
through
with
a
healthy
dose
of
alcohol
esters
taste
is
malty
to
start
but
very
thin
the
body
leaves
one
wanting
more
dry
finish
with
an
almost
sodalike
feel
despite
the
lack
of
body
this
beer
is
rather
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
drinking
these
in
the
backyard
on
a
summer
day
simply
because
its
so
light
d
english
stouts
arnt
the
style
im
most
familiar
with
so
take
the
above
review
with
a
grain
of
salt
that
being
said
this
was
a
sessionable
beer
with
more
flavor
than
many
other
beers
of
this
strength
if
i
had
this
constantly
available
to
me
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
pretty
often
on
a
side
note
awesome
cap
tea
sour
and
sweet
tobacco
up
front
followed
by
a
sensationally
pleasing
roast
milk
chocolate
and
herbal
lemon
hop
in
back
like
the
back
not
so
good
from
the
front
notes
this
is
just
a
good
solid
stout
with
all
the
heavy
hoppy
stouts
being
brewed
by
american
craft
brewers
it
is
refreshing
to
find
a
brewery
who
if
emphasizing
drinkability
not
that
i
mind
other
craft
beers
at
all
but
this
stout
is
dark
dry
and
roasty
with
lightmedium
body
and
nicely
balance
hop
bitterness
this
is
not
the
stout
id
expect
to
win
a
competition
but
it
is
a
stout
id
like
to
drink
several
of
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
obvious
lot
code
or
expiration
date
sampled
on
october
6
2009
the
pour
is
dark
brown
with
an
explosve
foamy
frothy
tan
head
that
seems
to
take
forever
to
simmer
down
the
aroma
comes
off
with
a
mix
of
roasted
chocoalte
malts
and
some
mild
hops
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
but
medium
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
on
the
tongue
the
taste
has
a
roasted
chocolate
malts
and
mild
hops
combo
with
a
little
bit
of
sugar
to
sweeten
the
punch
but
with
all
the
sweetness
at
the
start
there
is
a
kind
of
sour
finish
this
is
a
well
done
easy
to
drink
stout
the
feel
is
somewhat
ashy
on
the
palate
but
then
smooth
thinbodied
for
a
stout
but
milky
the
beer
overall
is
lots
of
chocolate
and
a
little
sweet
berry
a
pretty
decent
sweet
stout
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
mars
what
would
otherwise
be
a
decent
though
not
complex
stout
d
very
much
so
a
couple
in
a
sitting
is
nice
i
had
this
beer
a
month
ago
didnt
review
it
and
it
was
a
very
decent
stout
maybe
i
happened
to
get
a
bad
one
not
close
to
the
top
stouts
ive
encountered
d
suffers
from
heavy
mouthfeel
and
fullness
in
terms
of
drinkability
this
is
a
great
stout
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
nothing
too
extraordinary
fun
stuff
though
and
i
would
recommend
extremely
drinkable
and
tasty
mfd
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
too
thin
i
also
like
my
stouts
a
little
less
carbonated
definitely
worth
checking
out
pours
a
dark
brown
bordering
on
black
the
tan
head
fades
quickly
but
leaves
a
spring
of
effervesence
making
me
think
it
might
be
alive
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
not
only
due
to
the
malt
which
provides
a
nice
chocolatey
earthy
aroma
but
theres
a
bit
of
fruit
ester
as
well
the
taste
is
nice
and
earthy
the
malts
come
through
well
with
a
dry
finish
and
plenty
of
carbonation
this
poured
pitch
black
with
lots
of
bubbly
tan
head
it
smelled
like
alcohol
raisins
and
heavily
roasted
mocha
it
tasted
quite
dry
like
very
dark
and
bitter
chocolate
with
roasted
coffee
malt
it
was
fairly
thin
and
very
carbonated
with
a
mild
coffee
aftertaste
overall
this
was
not
a
good
stout
there
was
no
distinguishing
character
to
it
and
it
was
too
thin
and
like
all
of
the
cooperstown
beers
it
had
way
too
much
head
and
carbonation
their
beers
struggle
to
conceil
the
alcohol
scentflavor
and
this
stout
was
the
only
one
without
the
lemon
hops
scent
thank
goodness
this
beer
is
fairly
light
feeling
for
a
stout
but
it
is
definitely
not
lacking
in
flavor
poured
black
as
night
with
a
minimal
14
inch
tanbrown
head
this
one
let
absolutely
no
light
through
the
smell
was
a
nice
nutty
coffee
mix
with
hints
of
dark
chocolate
the
taste
was
on
par
with
the
smell
starting
off
nutty
and
bitter
with
definite
hints
of
coffee
cocoa
and
toffee
definite
roasty
malt
character
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
not
what
i
hoped
for
not
much
substance
for
a
stout
a
little
too
watery
decent
carb
and
nice
aftertaste
solid
stout
and
definitely
worth
a
try
d
not
the
best
ive
had
very
in
your
face
with
a
tannic
astringency
and
dryness
that
is
very
puckery
kinda
harsh
drinkability
not
a
very
good
stout
the
combination
of
the
carbonation
and
the
odd
sourness
takes
away
any
of
the
good
things
this
beer
may
have
had
to
offer
strike
three
gas
not
nolan
ryans
fastball
but
good
old
carbon
dioxide
this
made
it
undrinkable
it
was
just
plain
gassy
i
dont
know
what
happened
with
this
guy
im
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
or
if
the
funky
nature
of
this
stout
just
doesnt
agree
with
me
but
it
was
one
of
the
few
times
that
ive
drainpoured
a
beer
this
guy
will
definitely
be
up
for
a
rereview
at
some
point
down
the
line
pours
a
nice
black
color
with
lots
of
brown
and
tan
head
much
like
a
rootbeer
float
but
theres
too
much
head
and
it
takes
several
pours
and
waits
to
empty
the
bottle
good
retention
spotty
lacing
smells
are
very
roasted
and
smokey
with
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
and
caramel
taste
matches
the
smell
there
is
some
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
but
its
overly
roasty
with
a
smoky
finish
light
in
body
for
a
stout
very
high
in
carbonation
too
much
roasted
malt
and
carbonation
for
my
liking
not
very
balanced
the
beer
poured
a
dark
inky
opaque
black
with
a
huge
dark
tan
head
the
beer
smells
of
roasted
malts
with
maybe
just
a
subtle
hint
of
coffee
the
taste
has
a
very
large
roasted
malts
characteristic
to
it
starting
off
with
a
tiny
bit
of
bittersweet
chocolate
with
almost
a
smoky
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
more
carbonation
than
i
expected
i
would
consider
this
to
be
extremely
drinkable
for
a
stout
and
i
could
probably
put
back
two
or
three
without
any
problems
not
a
bad
little
beer
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
i
ended
up
picking
up
some
more
in
the
future
poured
coffee
black
into
a
nonic
complete
with
a
half
inch
of
brown
foam
that
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
what
youd
expect
of
a
stout
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
bitter
and
smoked
almost
ashen
some
malty
sweetness
shined
through
at
the
end
this
was
a
thick
brew
a
decent
stout
nothing
too
different
nothing
too
special
but
definitely
drinkable
pours
an
almost
onyx
black
with
a
huge
three
finger
thin
tan
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
frothy
layer
stickiness
decent
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
smell
well
it
has
the
typical
cooperstown
ringwood
yeast
aroma
up
front
with
a
roasted
nutty
like
scent
some
caramel
malt
and
chocolate
in
the
nose
as
well
taste
begins
with
a
smokey
oak
flavor
on
the
tongue
followed
by
fresh
espresso
lots
of
nutty
flavors
and
toasted
barley
all
the
way
through
to
the
finish
aftertaste
is
a
smokey
chocolate
malt
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
solid
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
was
surprised
the
ringwood
flavors
werent
as
present
as
the
smell
would
lead
you
to
believe
solid
stout
offered
by
cooperstown
really
not
a
bad
beer
not
flavor
overload
like
some
really
complex
stouts
but
still
a
solid
offering
poured
dark
from
the
bottle
with
a
light
brown
head
two
fingers
good
spotty
lacing
smells
of
chocolate
biscotti
taste
of
rich
dark
chocolate
roast
malt
with
a
dry
mouthfeel
that
makes
me
think
of
brazil
nuts
bitter
finish
i
found
this
very
drinkable
not
overly
complex
but
certainly
has
flavour
a
real
delight
with
a
certain
lightness
for
the
style
while
many
american
brewers
load
up
the
malts
jack
up
the
alcohol
and
have
kicked
the
stout
up
a
few
notches
cooperstown
keep
their
strike
out
stout
to
more
traditional
means
for
that
reason
its
largely
unexciting
in
comparison
but
that
cant
be
held
against
it
all
aspects
considered
this
is
a
fine
rather
sessionable
stout
pours
black
with
a
tannish
carmel
colored
head
aromas
of
caramel
and
a
roasty
malt
presence
tastes
of
the
same
small
amount
of
caramel
roasty
malt
and
a
chocolate
presence
light
in
the
body
with
a
clean
end
it
has
a
very
nice
flavor
for
a
lighter
body
md
smooth
and
light
bodied
a
pretty
good
stout
definitely
of
the
english
variety
you
can
fell
it
in
the
body
not
too
thick
and
a
mellow
rounded
flavor
but
still
a
quality
brew
that
upholds
the
cooperstown
reputation
a
truly
great
beer
i
wish
i
lived
closer
so
that
this
beer
was
easier
to
get
pours
the
darkest
of
browns
one
finger
plus
tan
head
that
did
not
disappear
good

i
wouldnt
go
out

the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
the
beer
has
a
prickly

i
let
the
beer
warm
to
room
temperature
and
it
really
didnt
improve
much
this
beer
met
the
sink
after
a
half
pint
very
good
stout
pours
a
dark
black
with
slight
red
touches
around
the
edges
the
smell
is
delicious
malts
and
a
sweet
chocolate
coming
through
the
taste
echos
the
smell
a
little
bitter
but
very
easy
to
drink
fair
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
just
a
really
enjoyable
beer
d
this
is
a
nice
dry
stout
and
its
nice
to
see
you
can
get
a
big
roasty
stout
at
4
6
abv
reaching
for
the
imperials
all
the
time
is
a
bit
draining
on
the
wallet
along
with
the
benchwarmer
porter
i
now
have
two
favorites
from
this
brewery
poured
a
near
jet
black
but
there
was
a
touch
of
redish
hue
when
in
the
light
a
thinner
off
white
head
on
top
that
left
no
lace
as
it
settled
quickly
highly
roasted
aromas
of
espresso
roast
coffee
and
unsweetened
chocolatethis
is
one
dry
ass
stout
roasted
to
the
hilt
and
quite
earthy
almost
to
much
so
dark
roast
coffee
and
cola
flavors
with
dry
woodylike
finish
if
you
like
ultra
dry
stouts
this
is
for
you
i
would
have
liked
a
touch
of
sweetness
but
this
has
some
nice
qualities
to
it
another
enjoyable
beer
from
the
cooperstown
collection
drinkability
not
my
first
choice
for
a
stout
this
beer
is
still
a
decent
representative
aroma
is
mildly
roasty
heavier
on
chocolate
and
has
a
very
off
warm
plastic
tinge
to
it
body
is
black
with
a
quickly
diminishing
two
finger
thick
mocha
head
this
is
one
of
the
faster
vanishing
heads
of
this
size
i
have
ever
seen
nice
roastey
fore
that
is
mildly
bitter
and
a
touch
thin
for
a
stout
has
some
very
faint
coffee
and
chocllate
notes
but
is
mostly
dominated
by
the
roasted
malt
flavors
it
tastes
pretty
good
actually
just
doesnt
go
anywhere
reallylike
an
akward
kid
dancing
in
one
spot
afraid
to
move
his
legs
the
finish
is
very
watery
even
for
a
sweet
stout
and
that
really
kills
the
feel
of
the
beer
style
wise
but
flavor
wise
its
okish
d
a
drinkable
beer
but
there
are
others
out
there
that
are
a
bit
more
full
bodied
very
low
abv
allows
this
to
somewhat
be
a
session
beer
if
youve
got
a
bunch
of
them
would
like
to
see
it
on
tap
if
possible
this
fine
brew
pours
a
dark
color
from
the
growler
there
was
a
descent
sized
head
which
lasted
for
a
short
period
the
smell
is
good
being
a
mixture
of
roasted
malt
with
chocolate
under
tones
the
taste
is
pleasant
with
nice
roasted
malts
and
a
nice
bitter
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
this
is
a
good
stout
while
i
wouldnt
run
out
to
buy
this
when
there
are
so
many
alternatives
out
there
i
certainly
would
not
pass
this
up
as
an
offering
on
tap
or
if
the
choices
are
limited
a
note
on
the
brewery
if
you
are
going
to
make
baseball
centric
brews
why
not
have
some
history
on
the
bottles
promoting
the
game
etc
it
strikes
me
pun
as
odd
that
there
is
no
such
effort
on
the
bottles
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
brings
this
category
down
a
notch
and
this
is
an
overall
average
english
stout
beers
beer
is
good
happy
traded
beering
thanks
kevin
not
a
beer
for
a
long
session
or
sunny
day
at
the
beach
but
definitely
a
highly
drinkable
stout
this
is
an
easy
going
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
its
much
better
than
i
remember
it
being
very
drinkable
im
not
a
big
stout
fan
but
this
one
went
down
real
easy
subtle
coffee
dry
roast
grain
hints
of
fruit
come
go
pretty
one
dimensional
in
the
flavour
department
medium
bodied
easy
carbonation
not
all
that
interesting
pretty
standard
off
the
rack
stout
look
to
this
beer
with
almost
as
much
head
as
there
would
be
beer
if
you
could
fit
the
whole
thing
into
a
glass
in
one
pour
the
smell
is
also
fairly
standard
with
a
nice
light
and
sharp
malt
backbone
with
chocolates
and
coffees
over
the
top
of
that
its
much
lighter
and
far
sharper
than
some
stouts
ive
had
and
id
say
the
smell
is
a
bit
weak
overall
the
taste
as
well
pretty
straight
forward
malts
hops
with
a
good
deal
of
burnt
chocolate
and
roast
coffee
beans
in
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
almost
fluffy
in
some
way
because
of
the
large
amount
of
carbonation
this
beer
is
nice
and
simple
nothing
astounding
but
definately
something
good
to
drink
pours
an
almost
jet
black
with
very
little
head
but
decent
lace
smells
of
an
average
stout
a
nice
roasted
malt
with
some
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
taste
again
of
an
average
stout
although
more
roasted
maltiness
than
hop
bitterness
high
carbonation
a
slightly
better
than
average
stout
had
qualities
more
of
a
porter
than
a
stout
but
a
good
brew
this
is
a
jet
black
beer
with
only
brown
highlights
at
best
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
has
a
good
brown
head
the
aroma
is
a
bold
roasted
maltyness
with
a
hint
of
something
sweet
in
the
background
the
same
roasted
malt
is
in
full
charge
of
the
taste
with
a
little
molasses
sweetness
just
before
the
clean
dry
finish
aroma
is
rich
and
chocolatey
sweetness
mixed
with
some
roasted
malt
qualities
no
real
hop
presence
first
sip
reveals
a
thick
viscous
bodywith
mild
rolling
carbonation
flavor
is
as
advertised
by
thenose
chocolate
some
coffee
and
roastiness
abound
there
is
a
rather
coating
quality
of
the
beer
on
my
tongue
which
i
find
pleasant
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
quite
a
tasty
brew
i
think
cheers
to
mccall
for
this
excellent
ny
stout
wyll
mouthfeel
is
godawful
huge
carbonation
and
thin
body
with
dirty
bitter
finish
strike
three
youre
out
overall
a
solid
stout
big
thanks
to
oldfrothingslosh
for
the
bottle
courtesy
of
kahns
in
indy
this
beer
is
nearly
opaque
and
almost
black
with
a
medium
thick
dark
brown
head
thin
and
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
roasted
coffee
and
some
malt
medium
to
rich
body
with
a
sweet
character
here
and
there
roasted
coffee
malt
and
some
hops
in
the
flavor
the
finish
thins
out
a
bit
and
is
only
mildly
sweet
but
this
is
still
a
fairly
good
stout
burnt
malt
coco
vinuous
alcoholic
raisins
in
the
aroma
giant
active
dark
hazelnut
colored
head
left
some
decent
lace
dark
opaque
brown
colored
beer
with
the
slightest
ruby
hue
around
the
bottom
edge
of
the
glass
a
light
bodied
beer
with
lots
of
carbonation
keeps
the
flavor
from
touching
the
tongue
i
swear
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
its
got
that
oat
flavor
and
theres
something
about
the
aftertaste
it
leaves
the
flavor
is
light
some
bitter
coffee
a
pinch
of
coco
and
a
little
dark
wine
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
oatmeal
stout
i
homebrewed
which
i
didnt
think
turned
out
all
that
well
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
thick
very
thick
and
frothy
tan
head
very
reminicent
of
a
root
beer
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
caramel
and
a
bit
of
a
musty
aroma
i
also
sence
fruit
the
taste
isof
caramel
and
in
my
opinion
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
stout
this
12oz
amber
bottle
offering
from
cooperstown
poured
a
spectacular
inky
blackness
with
a
noisy
rocky
and
frothy
tancolored
head
that
eventually
settled
down
to
a
fingerthin
level
very
nice
patchy
lacing
of
the
glass
aromas
are
hard
to
pick
up
soft
aromas
of
brewed
coffe
and
sweet
chocolate
flavor
falls
short
for
the
style
it
just
tasted
like
all
of
the
oomph
had
been
taken
out
of
this
beer
firm
toasty
base
with
cooking
fire
smokiness
layered
on
top
dark
chocolate
is
also
noted
but
again
its
not
doing
much
to
make
its
case
finishes
with
a
sweet
dryness
that
borders
on
puckering
mouthfeel
is
definitely
on
the
thin
side
with
a
lowmedium
carbonation
drinkability
is
tolerable
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
poured
with
a
very
large
lingering
easytorevive
tan
head
and
deep
impenetrable
dark
body
clean
three
muskateerslike
chocolate
aroma
and
starbucks
lattes
pretty
milky
and
far
more
soft
than
id
have
expected
after
i
got
into
the
flavors
dominated
by
a
roasted
coffee
beanlike
flavor
the
roasted
grains
really
drive
the
flavor
of
this
beer
no
tremendous
hop
presence
here
but
that
works
in
the
beers
favor
smooth
and
delicate
despite
the
foundation
of
the
flavors
lying
in
that
potent
roasted
flavor
a
bit
milky
definitely
lively
very
very
good
the
taste
a
lot
of
fizz
but
very
little
bang
weak
on
flavor
strong
on
bubbles
mild
coffee
and
dark
malt
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
this
is
just
horrid
pours
a
deep
black
syrup
with
a
very
creamy
mocha
head
the
aroma
is
heavily
smoky
with
a
distinct
chocolate
presence
the
body
is
a
bit
sharp
with
smoke
overtones
and
hints
of
black
malt
the
bitterness
is
moderate
with
a
bit
of
hop
spice
in
the
finish
like
the
porter
could
us
a
bit
more
stoutness
of
body
pours
a
deep
black
with
some
ruby
tinges
small
tan
head
that
quickly
diminishes
leaving
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
strong
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
toffee
flavor
is
smooth
creamy
dark
chocolate
some
roasted
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
toffee
in
the
back
mediumfull
body
my
pick
for
cooperstowns
best
brew
not
very
complex
and
i
found
it
to
be
almost
identical
to
their
porter
but
i
liked
that
better
kind
of
dull
and
unassuming
not
cooperstowns
best
effort
my
bottle
may
have
been
a
bit
old
i
didnt
entirely
trust
the
store
that
i
got
it
from
the
beer
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
doesnt
last
the
aroma
is
musty
with
a
dark
malt
appeal
the
taste
is
good
there
seems
to
be
lots
of
chocolate
malt
used
in
this
one
along
with
patent
malt
its
smooth
going
down
and
leaves
you
with
that
dark
malt
aftertaste
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
for
being
as
dark
as
it
is
its
an
average
stout
at
best
it
tastes
mysteriously
like
a
homebrew
that
i
conjured
up
not
at
all
what
i
would
consider
a
good
commercial
replica
roasty
with
a
touch
of
coffee
and
an
ongoing
chocolate
flavor
that
is
oh
so
nice
the
body
is
medium
full
but
that
is
a
tad
thin
for
my
liking
i
would
also
ask
for
a
bit
more
roastiness
as
there
is
a
lot
of
sweet
malts
that
need
to
take
second
in
command
to
that
deep
dark
character
i
love
in
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
i
would
sure
love
to
check
out
a
few
more
from
this
brewery
but
it
looks
like
someone
stole
my
benchwarmer
ah
the
hedonistic
pleasure
of
a
pulchritudinous
dark
and
brooding
stout
lazing
away
in
my
chalice
the
head
stupendous
in
size
creamy
in
its
consistency
and
the
fine
chocolate
brown
latticework
of
lace
that
longingly
caresses
the
glass
the
sweet
hint
of
toasted
grain
bittersweet
chocolate
and
coffee
quite
a
pleasure
for
the
schnozzle
sweet
at
the
front
thick
and
rich
at
the
top
finish
is
perfectly
hopped
modest
in
its
carbonation
with
a
dry
lingering
aftertaste
and
a
good
representative
to
the
sweet
stout
style
and
a
good
beer
for
the
novitiates
to
the
dark
side
thanks
to
davo
for
the
sample
and
burps
no
fault
of
yours
though
lightly
roasted
and
chocolately
with
a
good
fruity
base
medium
bodied
and
spritzy
on
the
tongue
finishes
dry
and
easy
perfectly
fine
in
all
aspects
but
nothing
that
smacks
you
in
the
face
which
incidentally
makes
it
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
opaque
black
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
holds
quite
well
but
leaves
no
lace
the
aroma
is
lightly
roasty
coffee
like
over
a
sweet
chocolatey
malt
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
fine
carbonation
thats
very
smooth
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
of
a
gently
fruity
sweet
and
roasty
chocolatey
malt
well
balanced
with
a
bitterness
thats
quite
subtle
it
finishes
dryish
with
a
short
lingering
roasty
malt
note
not
complex
nor
rich
but
well
balanced
and
highly
enjoyable
pours
a
pure
black
color
with
a
thick
brown
head
that
never
fully
disappears
sweet
chocolatey
malt
aroma
dominates
the
brew
with
a
touch
of
bitter
coffee
thrown
in
as
well
sweet
and
rich
chocolate
flavors
control
the
brew
with
a
subtle
roasted
coffee
flavor
lingering
in
the
background
as
the
brew
finishes
the
chocolate
flavors
fade
away
a
bit
and
allow
the
coffee
bitterness
to
come
forward
the
brew
is
actually
a
bit
thin
for
the
style
but
is
very
drinkable
and
rather
tasty
thanks
to
pbrian
for
this
one
notes
a
beautiful
stout
to
say
the
least
medium
to
heavy
in
body
and
very
flavourful
all
the
way
through
fairly
well
carbonated
with
a
fizz
on
the
tongue
starts
out
with
a
dryish
malty
flavor
blossoming
at
the
end
into
roasted
malt
and
unsweetened
chocolate
flavors
a
hint
of
black
dark
roast
coffee
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
save
for
a
nice
underlying
bitterness
worth
trying
for
the
way
the
flavors
explode
at
the
end
alone
a
very
enjoyable
well
made
stout
good
in
the
bottle
and
exceptional
on
tap
good
stout
black
thick
and
chewy
brewed
with
six
malts
smooth
easy
to
drink
the
abv
is
4
6
great
stuff
smooth
chocolately
and
slightly
bitter
coffee
right
up
my
alley
maybe
i
am
under
the
influence
of
some
odd
spell
cast
when
i
opened
the
bottle
but
i
feel
that
this
is
an
underrated
brew
belgian
stout
should
perhaps
be
a
separate
style
designation
at
least
for
splitters
such
as
myself
maybe
this
could
use
a
few
rougher
edges
to
add
complexity
and
character
in
any
event
might
be
worth
a
second
look
if
you
hated
it
on
the
first
pass
i
found
this
a
pleasant
example
of
a
stout
it
has
a
nice
mouth
feel
with
a
pleasant
roasted
character
its
straight
ahead
simple
to
enjoy
stout
not
the
best
but
a
solid
entry
none
the
less
o
too
thin
for
a
stout
needs
to
be
more
robust
in
both
body
and
flavor
not
much
going
quite
unique
stout
with
a
good
balance
between
roasted
ashy
tart
fruity
and
spicy
notes
in
my
opinion
this
is
underestimated
once
flavors
are
not
the
usual
easy
ones
for
stout
interesting
that
it
sure
has
dupont
genes
there
overall
rather
disappointing
for
a
belgian
stout
and
the
green
bottle
doesnt
help
matters
massively
carbonated

a
tightly
knit
khaki
colored
head
dark

and
only
a
bit
of
light

through

lacing
this
beer
is

with
a

i
got
a
bit

the
flavor

a
bit
on
the
sweet

malty
side
perhaps
a
bit
of
powdered

to

a
unique

pleasantly
enjoyable
offering
overall
highly
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
bottle
its
a
typical
stout
it
could
be
more
bitter
and
less
carbonated
good
but
not
great
not
really
what
i
wanted
dont
know
for
sure
if
its
interesting
or
just
not
well
made
an
english
stout
by
way
of
the
wallonian
countryside
this
is
perhaps
theres
a
reason
for
that
there
english
channel
the
english
have
their
stout
and
the
belgians
have
their
fruit
and
yeast
neer
the
two
shall
meet
but
here
they
have
and
the
result
is
middling
at
best
and
not
something
ill
be
jumping
to
revisit
od
not
overly
flavourful
or
complex
ok
but
nothing
id
reach
for
again
overall
a
disappointing
stout
i
try
not
to
set
expectations
for
beers
before
trying
them
but
when
they
come
from
a
reputable
brewery
such
as
dupont
its
hard
not
too
the
highlight
for
me
was
the
nose
it
was
complex
and
flavourful
if
only
that
were
to
have
continued
into
the
rest
of
the
categories
the
mouthfeel
is
what
really
threw
me
off
with
this
beer
its
too
thin
and
lacked
balance
their
saison
is
on
another
level
in
comparison
to
this
and
the
former
is
what
ill
stick
to
monks
stout
has
the
appearance
of
a
porter
or
dry
stout
being
pitch
black
with
a
quarter
inch
tan
head
for
the
aroma
i
picked
up
a
lot
of
various
dark
fruit
esters
and
belgian
yeast
i
found
that
the
tast
was
very
smoky
a
bit
roasted
and
tart
once
the
beer
sat
for
a
little
while
it
began
to
give
off
some
chocolately
flavors
too
very
light
bodied
and
light
in
the
mouth
feel
this
is
something
different
it
did
not
quite
taste
like
a
belgian
or
a
stout
not
sure
if
i
would
order
this
again
other
than
to
try
and
better
understand
or
appreciate
it
sourish
and
bitterish
aftertaste
is
not
the
best
reature
this
is
certainly
a
beer
that
doesnt
fit
easily
into
the
catalogue
but
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
from
the
750
ml
bottle
bought
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
o
its
ok
but
not
my
favorite
stout
kind
of
drinkable
but
not
terribly
tasty

a
serviceable
c
brasserie
duponts
monks
stout
is
an
odd
beast
i
could
drink
most
of
my
favourite
stouts
all
night
and
there
are
few
belgianstyle
ales
i
would
ever
turn
down
a
second
helping
of
but
this
fusion
of
the
two
leaves
me
feeling
underwhelmed
and
one
glass
will
be
more
than
enough
for
me
the
taste
is
fine
but
the
burnt
ashy
mouthfeel
really
hurts
its
drinkability
i
dont
regret
getting
this
one
but
i
doubt
ill
pick
it
up
again
or
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
traditional
stout
belgium
isnt
exactly
known
for
its
stouts
while
enjoyable
monks
stout
fails
to
make
much
headway
in
that
department
nevertheless
brasserie
dupont
could
have
done
nothing
for
the
rest
of
its
existence
but
make
saisons
and
the
world
would
still
love
them
so
i
respect
the
experimental
efforts
and
will
support
any
other
ambitions
this
excellent
producer
comes
up
with
overall
first
sip
wasnt
bad
but
it
rapidly
fell
apart
with
a
surprisingly
weak
body
and
sour
vinegary
flavour
im
all
for
trying
something
different
but
this
just
isnt
right
o
decent
enough
but
fairly
average
overall
o
tartness
is
really
throwing
this
off
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
well
blended
i
could
smell
this
for
hours
for
the
price
tag
this
is
not
something
i
would
ever
purchase
again
but
i
enjoyed
the
experience
overall
not
what
i
would
expect
from
dupont
an
ok
stout
nothing
exciting
but
quite
drinkable
bottle
from
the
dupont
lcbo
feature
and
the
weakest
though
most
unique
offering
body
looks
like
a
nitro
black
faint
roastiness
more
molasses
taste
a
weaker
stout
for
sure
soso
drinkability
and
dare
i
say
a
little
thin
a
little
bitter
but
not
interesting
watered
down
coffee
substitute
overall
not
really
a
stout
maybe
more
like
a
schwarzbier
anyways
i
expected
more
from
this
brewer
still
decent
just
needs
more
flavour
and
less
of
a
watery
feel
o
i
just
love
the
flavours
of
this
beer
some
belgian
notes
are
well
present
it
was
intended
to
be
a
britishbelgian
stout
hybrid
i
think
but
the
end
result
was
certainly
far
less
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
at
all
which
is
a
shame
as
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
this
again
brownish
ruby
body
ring
of
tan
head
not
much
lace
to
speak
of
a
bit
of
roast
smokey
with
some
darker
fruits
fairly
odd
smelling
yeasty
and
a
lingering
note
of
plastic
that
seems
to
persist
taste
has
a
bit
of
smoke
and
charredashy
flavours
as
well
dark
fruits
with
a
bit
of
an
odd
bitterness
as
well
here
high
carbonation
light
bodied
below
average
feel
for
a
stout
really
quite
unimpressive
not
quite
a
stout
and
not
quite
a
dark
belgian
too
many
odd
smells
and
flavours
to
make
this
enjoyable

d
was
pretty
pumped
to
try
this
as
part
of
the
dupont
lcbo
release
but
i
dont
think
i
will
be
revisiting
this
one
appearance
and
aroma
were
nice
but
the
taste
was
too
sour
for
my
stouts
and
mouthfeel
left
a
bit
to
be
desired
this
wasnt
terrible
but
it
wasnt
fantastic
this
had
flavors
and
aromas
that
i
never
imagined
or
thought
would
ever
go
in
a
bottle
i
guess
i
have
some
learning
still
to
do
d
great
balanced
belgianenglish
style
stout
750
ml
caged
and
corked
bottle
cork
says
2011
on
it
so
i
assume
it
was
bottled
sometime
last
year
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brownblack
with
a
huge
3
inch
head
this
one
foamed
up
pretty
much
as
soon
as
i
started
the
pour
and
it
took
a
while
for
the
head
to
recede
so
i
could
get
a
somewhat
full
glass
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
nice
but
light
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
and
some
dark
fruit
the
brew
tastes
like
roasted
and
burntcharred
malt
coffee
bitter
herbs
and
a
bit
of
tart
dark
fruit
i
liked
the
taste
of
this
the
longer
i
drank
it
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
its
smooth
and
has
high
carbonation
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
enough
brew
i
liked
it
o
easy
drinking
beer
but
at
the
same
time
not
very
attractive
a
british
style
beer
made
in
belgian
thats
perhaps
the
most
interesting
point
about
this
beer
overall
its
ok
but
not
memorable
nor
a
beer
ill
hunt
for
lots
of
others
out
there
a
mediocre
itteration
of
this
style
pass
overall
an
interesting
unique
beer
sort
of
a
cross
between
a
belgian
dark
and
a
porter
while
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
its
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
again
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
fruits
plum
wine
and
alcohol
taste
is
much
the
same
with
some
pomegranate
and
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
quite
disappointing
coming
from
dupont
o
this
beer
is
nice
and
light
making
it
very
easy
to
drink
it
seems
to
taste
like
a
hybrid
between
a
dry
stout
and
a
saison
o
surprisingly
refreshing
a
style
that
i
do
not
often
have
but
almost
reminds
me
of
what
the
hybrid
of
a
saison
and
an
export
stout
would
be
like
enjoyable
but
not
one
that
i
would
run
out
to
get
again
soon
first
brewed
in
the
1950s
dupont
reincarnated
this
from
their
recipe
archives
this
one
could
and
should
have
been
tweaked
a
bit
more
its
trying
to
be
more
of
a
stout
and
forgetting
its
belgian
but
dont
blame
the
monksthey
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
worth
a
try
if
you
can
handle
an
acrid
burnt
character
pour
is
opaque
black
with
a
thin
tan
colored
head
the
nose
is
nice
dry
and
roasted
malt
notes
of
coffee
and
light
chocolate
with
a
light
hop
balance
the
taste
is
equally
as
nice
very
roasty
with
notes
of
coffee
some
sweet
hop
profile
in
the
finish
balances
creamy
and
soft
body
with
strong
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
deep
roasted
malt
profile
and
nice
balance
d
ok
i
cant
get
over
the
fact
that
this
beer
smells
and
to
a
lesser
degree
tastes
like
ham
not
good
ham
either
more
like
old
lunch
meat
or
burnt
rotten
ham
really
bad
even
more
disappointing
considering
it
comes
from
a
brewery
that
we
all
know
can
do
so
much
better
than
this
i
didnt
think
i
would
ever
have
a
dupont
drain
pour
but
here
it
is
and
there
it
goes
overall
this
one
is
just
not
very
good
it
may
actually
deserve
a
lower
ranking
its
not
very
drinkable
and
if
not
for
being
a
share
this
would
have
been
a
drain
pour
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
light
roast
a
small
caramel
and
coffee
presence
in
the
taste
roasty
coffee
to
caramel
like
with
a
toffee
like
sweetness
quite
smooth
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
note
of
coffee
in
the
aftertaste
nice
coffee
notes
and
sweetness
of
caramel
and
toffee
pleasant
and
nice
to
drink
to
be
honest
i
understand
why
this
isnt
that
highly
regarded
but
its
a
really
interesting
brew
nonetheless
it
has
far
more
of
that
roast
character
than
you
ever
see
in
a
belgian
ale
but
in
most
other
respects
it
really
falls
into
that
style
as
a
result
its
a
weird
amalgam
that
doesnt
really
fit
anywhere
that
makes
it
challenging
but
it
also
makes
it
quite
fascinating
o
nothing
spectacular
but
this
is
an
easydrinking
stout
dont
mind
putting
down
all
750
mls
on
my
own
3
5
d
i
would
never
ever
buy
this
again
but
i
cant
say
i
didnt
enjoy
it
its
not
impressive
in
the
least
but
for
some
reason
its
just
what
i
wanted
right
now
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
belgian
dark
ale
not
a
stout
o
good
beer
with
some
eclectic
combinations
could
have
a
few
in
one
sitting
overall
reminded
me
of
a
dry
irish
stout
a
nice
expression
of
a
stout
light
in
character
and
quite
drinkable
although
lacking
a
bit
of
depth
in
taste
beer
is
super
thin
and
a
little
bitter
not
much
going
on
here
it
is
drinkable
but
unremarkable
not
a
repeat
this
is
a
light
stout
for
sure
and
may
throw
a
few
people
off
thinking
that
this
would
be
some
big
heavy
stout
its
not
but
a
nice
simple
stout
with
a
subtle
belgian
twist
i
like
it
i
feel
it
is
solid
and
one
i
would
drink
again
i
just
think
i
would
be
more
likely
to
buy
it
if
it
were
on
tap
at
a
lesser
price
pours
nearly
black
without
any
real
head
formation
or
lace
a
good
swirl
brings
a
few
mocha
bubbles
but
thats
about
it
the
nose
brings
some
nice
roasted
chocolate
character
with
some
slight
belgianyeast
aromatics
the
flavor
falls
back
with
heavy
roast
the
chocolate
and
yeast
are
merely
background
noise
medium
body
with
a
semidry
finish
that
is
a
bit
acrid
decent
25oz
bottle
corked
and
caged
opens
with
a
vigorous
pop
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
light
head
consisting
of
lots
of
really
tiny
bubbles
aroma
is
strange
mineral
tart
sour
metallic
in
the
taste
much
different
than
the
nose
with
a
good
dose
of
lush
chocolate
malted
milk
roast
and
coffee
grounds
well
balanced
though
there
is
little
hop
flavor
just
mild
leafy
notes
more
cocoa
coffee
and
toast
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
finishing
slightly
dry
overall
i
was
quite
surprised
with
this
one
a
really
nice
find
a
belgian
stout
with
some
character
hehe
maybe
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
one
i
love
the
other
beers
from
dupont
so
i
guess
my
expectations
were
a
little
high
oh
well
they
cant
all
be
winners
overall
another
belgian
style
stout
that
is
neither
good
nor
awful
not
offputting
by
any
sense
of
the
imagination
but
also
not
memorable
or
worth
revisiting
on
purpose
might
as
well
pass
on
this
and
try
something
else
o
overall
this
beer
really
is
fairly
mediocre
at
best
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
bottle
of
this
and
only
had
to
stomach
the
small
pour
of
this
stuff
ugh
nosefilling
aroma
has
firm
tones
of
charred
wood
and
yeast
with
a
hint
of
licorice
it
pours
a
deep
opaque
sable
with
a
fairly
thick
tan
head
smoky
malty
flavor
has
tones
of
molasses
caramel
and
roast
coffee
with
a
licorice
hint
texture
is
a
teensy
on
the
thin
side
but
strongly
tingly
overall
if
not
the
best
porter
available
a
worthy
beer
thin
bodied
and
watery
with
lots
of
tight
carbonationslight
oxidization
that
lingers
throughout
making
it
tough
to
drink
some
roasted
chocolate
malt
but
its
very
dry
and
flavorless
with
subtle
metallic
and
cardboard
really
unpleasant
to
drink
i
was
told
by
two
different
bartenders
and
another
ba
that
this
is
the
way
the
beer
tasted
not
infected
just
not
very
good
im
not
so
sure
but
either
way
it
tastes
pretty
awful
o
coffeeish
o
before
trying
this
beer
i
could
safely
say
that
brasserie
dupont
does
not
produce
a
single
bad
beer
but
now
i
cant
say
that
my
respect
for
the
brewery
keeps
me
from
giving
this
unfortunate
accident
an
absolutely
stinging
review
but
it
really
is
pretty
awful
its
like
someone
who
had
never
tasted
a
stout
but
had
perhaps
seen
a
few
guinness
advertisements
decided
to
brew
a
stout
with
the
exception
of
color
this
beer
has
nothing
in
common
with
real
stouts
what
was
the
brewing
team
at
dupont
thinking
with
duponts
reputation
as
a
saison
brewer
its
interesting
to
see
something
this
dark
come
out
from
their
way
it
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
translucent
at
the
edges
evincing
a
mild
bit
o
dark
garnet
topped
by
about
two
fingers
of
dusty
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
very
husky
i
might
add
light
chocolate
powder
and
toasted
wheat
the
taste
goes
further
down
the
roasty
road
with
heavy
roasted
malts
darklytoasted
wheat
and
what
seems
like
lightly
acridly
bitter
coffee
things
are
a
bit
harsh
here
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
one
of
the
driest
finishes
ive
ever
seen
in
a
stout
the
dryness
doesnt
help
the
bitterness
any
overall
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
its
too
burnt
too
roasty
for
its
own
good
bottle
poured
a
black
color
stout
with
a
large
offwhite
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
light
roasted
malt
with
notes
of
the
typical
belgian
malt
used
by
dupont
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
dry
roasted
malt
with
a
solid
malt
backbone
and
light
dry
esters
of
black
chocolate
body
is
somewhat
thin
with
great
carbonation
ok
though
i
have
a
huge
preference
for
dupont
regular
saison
over
this
o
this
was
disappointing
i
wouldnt
get
this
again
really
boring
and
what
i
did
find
interesting
about
this
beer
was
not
that
pleasant
no
aftertaste
lingers
duponts
stout
pours
in
the
tulip
black
creating
a
dark
black
look
in
the
vessel
that
takes
care
of
that
a
dense
like
cream
colored
inch
of
foam
up
top
with
good
retention
yet
no
stick
smell
is
english
yeast
up
to
the
max
interesting
to
see
a
belgian
brewery
take
on
this
style
more
smells
peat
smoke
chocolate
vanilla
and
cream
taste
is
pretty
much
stated
above
in
the
taste
portion
the
english
ingredients
take
hold
alot
cocco
vanilla
cream
and
peat
influence
feel
is
light
bodied
with
tight
carb
thats
not
bitey
yet
there
is
a
sourness
towards
the
end
which
kills
it
i
like
this
low
alcohol
and
light
bodied
stout
but
it
tastes
a
bit
disjointed
and
the
aftertaste
is
horrid
o
i
love
dupont
saison
dupont
is
a
modern
classic
and
they
make
a
lot
of
good
beer
i
loved
the
new
witbier
i
recently
had
from
them
this
just
isnt
that
good
bland
and
uninspiring
unfortunately
jd
wanted
and
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
stout
not
impressed
at
all
looks
good
but
fails
to
deliver
o
not
a
bad
stout
but
for
me
there
is
not
much
to
go
on
i
rather
have
an
imperial
an
interesting
beer
and
an
interesting
mix
of
styles
not
sure
if
people
are
crying
out
for
an
english
stout
crossed
with
a
belgian
pale
but
at
least
dupont
can
say
they
have
done
it
am
finally
getting
around
to
posting
my
notes
taken
on
the
spot
at
a
winterbeer
festival
in
brussels
last
december
the
festival
billed
as
the
debut
of
the
beer
perhaps
it
had
more
than
one
and
what
was
presented
might
have
been
more
of
a
preview
as
i
gathered
from
later
speaking
with
someone
at
dupont
possibly
it
was
not
the
final
recipe
for
the
commercial
run
when
i
find
it
again
in
good
tasting
environment
ill
rereview
for
what
its
worth
here
goes
poured
from
the
keg
perfectly
black
with
just
a
ring
of
ivory
foam
aroma
of
coffee
pepper
some
herbal
spice
like
coriander
a
toasty

solid
example
of
a
nice
sessionable
stout
plenty
of
flavor
especially
given
the
abv
and
flavor
this
helps
put
away
the
myth
that
beers
need
a
high
abv
for
high
flavor
well
balanced
and
good
integration
of
all
the
typical
stout
flavors
really
enjoyable
stout
its
unfortunate
that
it
doesnt
get
exported
definitely
worth
grabbing
although
im
not
sure
if
its
quite
good
enough
to
go
to
a
lot
of
trouble
for
fanfreakingtastic

this
beer
pours

has
aromas
of

has

start
and
finishes
a
little
light
with
notes
of

coming
thru
with
a
watery

finish
not
bad
but
definately
no
world
beater
by
any
means
overall
a
nice
beer
could
drink
a
few
but
there
are
others
out
there
that
are
more
impressive
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
again
but
if
i
came
across
one
by
chance
i
wouldnt
hesitate
md
superbly
balanced
on
the
body
and
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
yet
retaining
a
light
even
refreshing
palate
throughout
the
sourness
and
bitterness
are
tuned
to
such
an

that
every

is

deep
in

this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
served
at

correct
temperature
at
fridge
temp
it
had
a
very
subdued
roasty
flavour
with
thick
mouthful
after
it
warmed
up
a
little
wow
a
wonderful
smooth
chocolate
maltyness
came
through
lovely
the
full
mouthful
and
smooth
chocolate
flavour
developed
into
a
wonderful
mocha
flavour
that
was
something
to
savour
i
couldnt
detect
much
hop
character
all
chocolate
and
roast

finishes
with

great
beer
one
of
the
smoothest
easy
drinking
stouts
that
i
have
tasted
they
pull
that
chocolate
thing
off
so
nicely
it
never
descends
into
astringent
bitterness
overall
an
excellent
stout
highly
recommended
a
solid
stout
a
little
too
much
of
a
dry
lingering
chalkiness
but
pretty
good

really
enjoyed
it

and

with
a
slight
smoky

with
a
touch
of
acid

citrus

medium

not

as
well
the
aromas
keep
growing
as
i
write
but
this
is
not
exciting
at
all
might
have
it
again
if
not
better
dark
ales
available
overall
enjoyable
stout
which
is
easy
to
gulp
down
could
easily
sink
a
pint
of
this
without
feeling
too
bloated
and
the
taste
is
smooth
o
the
flavor
scrubbing
fizz
and
the
off
flavors
are
the
only
dimensions
to
the
malt
flavor
and
they
are
a
bit
odd
i
dont
think
the
off
flavors
are
related
to
the
oysters
but
they
just
dont
compliment
any
of
the
malt
flavors
o
enjoyable
stout
that
goes
down
easy
o
really
rather
disappointing
considering
this
is
a
highly
regarded
beer
not
least
of
all
being
a
brewing
industry
international
gold
medal
winner
having
said
that
this
is
very
drinkable
and
could
make
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
just
not
that
tasty
even
a
little
watery
o
this
is
a
very
mediocre
oyster
stout
both
nose
and
the
palate
are
very
unrefined
everything
just
seems
out
of
whack
this
one
is
quite
crude
and
really
needs
some
work
to
be
drinkable
from
the
500

it
pours
close
to
black
with
ruby
red
hues
and
a
longlasting
tan
head
the
aroma
does
little
to
make
me
think
it
is
a
stout
there
are
dark
grainy
malts
some
vague
fruit
and
maybe
a
slight
hop
crispness
but
it
is
all
very
subtle
the
body
is
thin
as
for
the
taste
i
get
little
that
makes
me
think
of
a
stout
it
is
more
like
a
heineken
dark
with
an
offdry
finish
this
goes
down
quickly
though
no
offensive
taste
well
maybe
because
it
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
taste
not
very
recomended
although
its
quite
cheap
nice
balance
flavor
chocolate
notes
with
a
medium
body
very
smooth
coffee
flavor
i
liked
it
very
much
i
couldnt
ask
for
much
more
from
an
oyster
stoudt
great
look
you
can
really
taste
the
flavors
hope
you
all
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
am
o
this
one
isnt
what
i
was
hoping
for
to
say
the
least
the
body
is
a
bit
too
thin
to
showcase
what
the
oyster
shell
adds
to
it
overall
didnt
really
get
any
of
the
oyster
flavor
i
was
expecting
just
a
slight
briny
saltiness
still
a
decent
stout
though
opaque
motor
oil
color
roasty
and
caramelized
malt
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
hint
of
brineyness
has
to
be
the
worse
imagined
beer
ever
quality
beer
great
example
of
an
oyster
stout
my
new
favorite
thing
from
flying
dog
this
light
for
a
stout
it
strikes
me
as
more
of
a
porter
in
color
clarity
and
body
but
it
definitely
has
the
bigger
stout
flavor
i
never
thought
of
a
stout
as
being
refreshing
but
this
one
really
is
the
aroma
is
roasty
chocolatey
and
bready
but
with
a
hint
of
salty
sea
breeze
if
thats
possible
the
flavor
is
very
much
like
the
aroma
it
is
at
once
dark
and
comforting
but
at
the
same
time
crisp
and
refreshing
its
brewed
with
oysters
and
if
you
close
your
eyes
and
use
your
imagination
you
can
picture
a
nice
bowl
of
oyster
stew
to
go
along
with
this
brew
a
bonus
is
that
purchase
of
this
beer
benefits
planting
new
oysters
in
the
chesapeake
bay
as
part
of
the
oyster
recovery
program
i
cant
wait
to
have
another
after
finishing
the
beer
the
aroma
left
behind
in
the
empty
glass
finally
sparked
what
i
perhaps
like
so
much
about
it
it
reminds
me
of
a
chocolate
bar
with
cracked
sea
salt
yeah
its
good
one
of
my
favorites
delicious
smooth
and
easy
this
beer
had
a
roasty
taste
the
slight
saltiness
enhanced
this
nice
fairly
low
bodied
stout
pretty
good
very
interesting
being
brewed
with
oysters
o

this
is
not
to
noteworthy
it
is
a
decent
stout
i
would
not
reject
another
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
the
charred
wood
flavor
is
nice
but
the
body
is
a
bit
lacking
mostly
black
with
a
tinge
of
red
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
a
brown
head
that
dies
to
a
ring
at
is
roasted
malt
chocolate
raisins
and
a
slighty
salted
tatse
stays
on
the
tounge
good
but
not
great
i
love
this
stout
the
oysters
give
it
a
slight
briny
flavor
that
mixes
so
well
a
nice
big
beer
that
has
a
quirkiness
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
rest
overall
not
really
much
oyster
going
on
in
this
one
besides
the
nose
which
gives
a
decent
level
of
saltiness
overall
the
brew
is
really
just
a
drier
and
roastier
stout
ok
but
nothing
exceptional
this
beer
reminds
me
somewhat
of
gonzo
imperial
porter
huige
bold
maltforward
tastes
powerful
flavors
flying
dogs
big
beers
just
seem
so
bold
i
liked
this
beer
far
and
away
my
favorite
flying
dog
beer
strong
roast
aroma
that
goes
down
surprisingly
smooth
delicious
massive
roast
on
the
nose
deep
dark
and
charred
maybe
a
little
brine
and
sulfur
taste
is
more
of
the
same
huge
roasty
malts
that
leave
a
lingering
ashy
chocolate
note
in
their
wake
just
a
trace
of
sulfur
and
brine
is
found
at
the
finish
the
abundant
roastiness
makes
this
more
american
than
english
to
me
but
that
doesnt
really
matter
this
is
damn
good
beer
thats
what
matters
proceeds

kudos
to

heres
a
go
at
my
first
oyster
stout
nice
dark

thick

so
far
good
very
chocolaty
smell

smoked

glad
it
doesnt
smell

wow
what
a
bitter
taste
dark
chocolate
flavors
coffee
toffee
little
mineral
flavor
again
glad
it
doesnt
have
a
fishy
taste
its
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
stout
liking
but
much
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
additional
info
well
by
the
end
of
the
glass
it
got
kind
of
oystery
a
little
to
powerful
for
me
i
enjoyed
the
first
half
not
the
second
love
this
beer
not
a
style
that
is
very
approachable
for
the
casual
craft
enthusiast
the
appearance
is
a
cloudy
dark
brown
with
a
thick
cream
head
the
smell
was
a
mixture
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
the
taste
however
is
very
different
starting
out
with
the
caramel
and
coffee
and
then
at
the
end
it
was
cut
by
the
salty
fatty
flavor
of
the
oysters
i
found
it
incredibly
satisfying
and
refreshing
not
for
the
faint
but
a
wonderful
find
o
this
is
a
fine
stout
very
mild
bodied
and
smooth
for
a
stout
drinkable
nice
smokey
and
salt
characters
both
for
smell
and
taste
the
hint
of
oysters
is
ever
so
subtle
but
extremely
nice
to
pair
with
the
smokey
and
salt
flavors
first
beer
i
bought
in
maryland
from
my
relocation
from
oregon
was
interested
in
trying
something
new
the
the
oyster
aspect
triggered
my
interest
i
brought
it
home
and
when
i
pored
it
it
was
had
a
nice
off
white
head
smelled
like
a
typical
stout
but
had
a
light
roasted
malt
smell
that
i
am
used
to
the
oysters
are
pretty
noticeable
and
the
beer
had
a
slimy
finish
i
was
pretty
dissatisfied
in
the
overall
quality
of
the
beer
with
the
sliminess
and
the
lack
of
a
backbone
i
would
not
buy
it
again
taste
like
a
liquid
ashtray
or
cigarette
butt
not
my
thing
i

which
dissipates
down
to
a

covering
of
froth
on
the
top
of
the
beer
with
solid
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
actually
fairly
light
but
contains
all
the
usual
stout
notes
dark
malt
dark
chocolate
toffee
a
touch
of
wan
espresso
and
though
i
may
be
mistaking
it
there
does
seem
to
be
a
hint
of
bitter
citrus
hops
also
perhaps
its
the
name
but
it
does
seem
that
there
is
a
hint
of
oyster
sauce
in
there
not
briny
oysters
and
seaside
air
mind
you
but
a
hint
of
the
slightly
briny
but
mostly
sweet
hoisinlike
asian
condiment
sip
is
toffee
and
lightly
bitter
chocolate
up
front
and
is
actually
somewhat
sweet
the
middle
of
the
tongue
sees
more
of
the
bitterness
with
dark
coffee
notes
taking
over
along
with
what
seems
a
touch
of
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
sweet
citrus
fruit
yeah
i
know
that
one
seems
weird
but
it
really
does
seem
to
be
there
back
of
the
tongue
sees
more
coffee
notes
along
with
a
hint
of
toffee
and
the
finish
which
is
pretty
short
and
simple
is
lightly
sweetened
coffee
mouthfeel
is
actually
quite
light
and
the
carbonation
like
most
everything
from
flying
dog
is
a
bit
heavy
so
the
big
question
is
where
is
the
oyster
in
all
of
this
the
classic
hint
i
can
find
is
a
note
approaching
oyster
sauce
in
the
midpalate
when
it
warms
slightly
but
as
a
whole
i
cant
find
any
and
cant
help
but
wondering
if
there
might
have
been
a
better
use
for
those
local
oysters
as
it
stands
this
is
a
perfectly
decent
stout
nothing
especially
grand
but
also
quite
sessionable
due
to
its
heavy
carbonation
lightforthestyle
mouthfeel
nice
hints
of
sweetness
amidst
the
roastier
bitter
notes
and
low
abv
had
one
of
these
left
at
the
house
during
the
last
fire
pit
i
have
seen
this
beer
at
beer
nerd
locations
in
carolina
pa
virginia
and
new
jersey
but
have
never
tried
it
being
from
frederick
i
always
want
something
from
somewhere
else
anyway
here
we
go
nothing
to
shout
about
in
appearance
and
offers
very
little
to
the
nose
taste
was
good
but
far
from
great
plus
the
low
abv
for
a
stout
causes
me
to
ding
it
again
this
is
a
miss
for
me
overall
its
solid
stuff
its
not
going
to
blows
off
your
socks
but
its
a
decent
beer
made
with
skill
and
good
execution
o
an
above
average
stout
and
i
was
hesitant
at
first
because
of
the
oyster
in
the
name
but
it
is
really
tasty
o
this
is
not
a
bad
little
stout
oyster
stouts
generally
dont
do
it
for
me
but
this
one
really
isnt
bad
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
nice
to
see
such
an
obscure
style
get
some
love
from
an
american
brewery
overall
a
decent
beer
way
better
than
i
thought
it
was
gonna
be
worth
a
try
the
taste
is
very
nice
some
roasted
malts
slight
bitterness
very
drinkable
definitely
nothing
bad
about
it
overall
a
good
stout
better
than
i
expected
i
would
definitely
get
again
this
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
robust
the
taste
is
light
and
roust
with
a
fairly
thin
texture
overall
this
is
a
pretty
light
in
taste
and
texture
stout
that
drinks
very
easily
poured
a
blackish
body
with
minimal
tan
head
that
dies
slow
with
minor
lace
i
get
a
little
sweetness
in
the
aroma
but
even
that
is
more
bitter
chocolate
than
anything
some
large
chunks
of
roasted
malt
and
a
splash
of
coffee
also
hit
me
in
the
nose
the
beer
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
slightly
chewey
enjoyable
sipper
but
a
mostly
dry
stout
with
roasted
malts
and
again
i
get
this
coffee
thing
dominating
and
just
minor
bitter
chocolate
notes
mixed
in
the
finish
seems
a
little
grainy
so
i
suppose
this
is
where
the
oyster
kick
is
which
isnt
bad
as
it
isnt
burdensome
and
lends
itself
to
the
beer
also
seems
to
have
a
touch
of
wood
since
it
goes
down
smooth
not
a
bad
stout
at
all
but
one
that
is
a
little
simple
for
my
liking
o
not
as
odd
as
i
thought
this
is
my
first
oyster
stout
and
i
like
it
extremely
dry
at
the
finish
aster
a
good
progression
of
flavors
overall
a
really
nicely
done
oyster
stout
i
love
the
mineral
character
and
some
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
notes
decent
beer
the
taste
comes
across
as
highly
balanced
with
a
moderate
upfront
sweetness
and
toasted
malt
flavor
and
then
there
is
a
low
and
dry
bitterness
which
hangs
briefly
at
the
finish
this
one
was
well
done
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
an
ok
beer
to
drink
for
something
a
bit
different
great
name
the
beer
pours
with
a
deep
utterly
black
color
its
head
is
thick
tan
and
very
creamy
large
tufts
of
lace
are
left
on
along
the
glass
the
smell
is
solid
but
i
expected
a
little
more
its
full
of
roasted
malty
scents
a
little
earth
and
charcoal
some
subtle
coffee
smells
the
taste
is
very
good
semidry
and
very
full
lots
of
grain
flavors
some
smoke
and
a
lot
of
smoothness
the
mouthfeel
has
some
interesting
salty
and
calciumreminiscent
characteristics
perhaps
from
the
oysters
lingering
bitterness
this
is
a
good
beer
well
worth
trying
first
thing
that
strikes
me
is
the
beautiful
color
black
around
the
edges
with
a
deep
blood
red
hue
shining
through
the
middle
the
head
dissipated
quickly
and
left
very
little
lacing
smells
like
roasted
coffee
some
herbal
hops
briny
sea
salt
near
the
end
the
flavor
was
absolutely
phenomenal
faithfully
following
the
nose
with
coffee
roasted
grain
dry
chocolate
sea
salt
and
woody
herbal
hops
at
the
end
thankfully
does
not
taste
like
oysters
went
down
easy
with
a
slight
carbonic
bite
and
a
medium
thin
mouthfeel
a
great
stout
even
with
the
gimmick
of
seafood
in
it
o
very
interesting
stout
and
one
id
probably
come
back
to
when
pairing
with
a
meal
overall
i
feel
like
i
missed
the
whole
brewed
with
oysters
flavor
maybe
a
hint
of
it
on
the
aroma
but
that
might
have
been
my
imagination
overall
a
very
fine
beer
just
missing
the
gimmick
from
the
label
an
enjoyable
stout
overall
very
light
oyster
stout
with
a
great
approach
of
of
the
dogs
best
overall
interesting
but
nothing
id
rush
out
to
get
again
the
body
is
quite
thin
and
the
beer
is
a
bit
lacking
in
flavor
o
this
is
a
nice
stout
from
flying
dog
the
oysters
do
add
a
nice
albeit
subtle
complexity
to
what
would
otherwise
be
a
straightforward
beer
the
slightly
salty
mineral
flavors
towards
the
finish
are
welcome
in
my
opinion
overall
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
love
oysters
and
appreciate
the
inclusion
probably
other
comparable
abv
stouts
id
prefer
to
drink
overall
very
good
stout
best
if
you
enjoy
a
stout
that
is
dominated
by
malts
i
enjoy
the
taste
but
would
like
a
more
powerful
aroma
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
stout
i
prefer
others
over
it
but
i
would
drink
this
again
the
flavor
has
a
nice
creamy
caaramel
flavor
with
light
roasted
barley
flavor
with
some
mild
mineral
and
slight
bitter
flavors
in
the
background
the
taste
is
kind
of
a
mix
of
sweet
stout
and
dry
irish
with
the
smoothness
of
yeast
and
some
slight
spice
from
the
hops
overall
this
is
a
pleasant
and
drinkable
stout
pretty
good
considering
the
relatively
low
abv
it
conveys
a
mix
of
sweet
stout
with
an
american
oyster
addition
which
i
actually
like
enough
to
have
multiples
of
taste
smooth
briny
earthiness
soft
charcoal
kiss
of
hops
and
a
roasty
finish
what
a
great
unique
flavor
it
would
probably
be
delightful
with
twelve
fresh
halfshells
time
may
have
done
this
one
well
or
it
may
have
been
pretty
good
to
begin
with
a
very
good
stout
with
a
unique
oyster
twist
try
it
i
like
oysters
and
i
like
stouts
i
even
like
the
two
in
the
same
glass
flying
dog
did
well
with
the
pearl
necklace
a
respectable
alternative
as
a
lighter
stout
overall
moderately
roasty
with
a
slightly
sweet
finish
and
a
little
understated
brineoyster
saltiness
that
gives
the
beer
a
unique
character
that
differentiates
it
from
a
typical
dry
or
sweet
stout
nice
stout
but
i
wish
i
could
taste
some
oyster
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
but
not
bad
i
think
it
was
really
brewed
for
the
shock
value
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
worth
the
try
i
think
it
would
be
better
though
without
the
mineral
and
salt
water
taste
overall
i
cant
really
taste
oysters
but
it
a
pretty
tasty
beer
for
sure
it
has
a
nice
well
balanced
taste
is
extremely
drinkable
seems
like
a
great
session
beer
despite
the
slightly
higher
abv
o
this
is
orobably
the
most
mineralsalt
forward
oyster
stout
that
ive
tried
to
date
but
its
not
overpowering
overall
an
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
o
an
interesting
style
and
a
good
beer
no
doubt
but
the
oyster
influence
is
very
subtle
a
good
cause
bay
preservation
and
a
tasty
stout
in
its
own
right
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
that
id
drink
again
even
though
the
taste
was
far
better
than
the
smell
suggested
it
was
going
to
be
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
the
whole
brewed
with
oysters
thing
was
messing
with
my
head
because
oysters
and
beer
just
seem
like
an
odd
couple
combination
i
like
oysters
and
i
like
stouts
but
the
two
combined
just
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
an
interesting
stout
brewed
with
actual
oysters
rich
and
smooth
with
a
nicely
balanced
and
complex
feel
throughout
a
very
nice
variation
on
a
classic
dark
ale
style
definitely
my
favorite
flying
dog
brew
to
date
brewed
with
chesapeake
bay
oysters
who
would
have
thought
velvety
looking
black
color
cocoa
powder
aromatics
oozing
out
bubbly
and
dense
tan
head
black
licorice
and
tobacco
on
the
nose
as
well
i
dont
smell
fish
at
all
and
this
doesnt
taste
salty
instead
i
get
bittersweet
roasted
barley
chocolate
malt
and
faint
espresso
notes
the
texture
is
what
makes
this
beer
for
me
creamy
and
rich
while
retaining
its
drinkability
nice
as
an
after
dinner
session
beer
or
as
an
interesting
conversation
piece
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
flying
dog
but
this
beer
really
steps
it
up
in
both
creativity
and
execution
worth
seeking
out
any
other
good
oyster
beers
out
there
how
did
this
start
i
want
to
know
more
overall
one
of
my
go
to
six
packs
and
something
i
like
drinking
with
seafood
or
dessert
not
a
bad
stout
3

d
im
not
sure
if
ive
ever
had
a
stellar
oyster
stout
but
they
always
seem
to
be
pretty
good
they
intrigue
me
pretty
disappointing
to
be
honest
and
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
not
because
it
was
a
bad
stout
but
because
it
was
so
basic
throughout
whilst
drinkable
this
one
was
just
a
little
too
bland
to
really
enjoy
o
a
solid
beer
overall
not
terribly
complex
but
enjoyable
and
drinkable
overall
a
good
little
stout
here
lends
itself
well
to
be
a
nitro
beer
a
fine
craft
offering
without
a
doubt
older
style
done
well
by
the
mega
craft
brewery
there
is
a
place
in
the
world
for
a
beer
like
this
its
called
your
local
bar
o
i
like
this
beer
though
i
hate
the
name
not
over
complicated
but
balanced
and
tasty
o
my
first
ever
oyster
stout
and
i
enjoyed
this
brew
a
powerful
uniqe
flavor
that
i
will
enjoy
again
all
in
all
id
say
its
got
a
bit
too
much
bite
for
a
stout
theres
a
good
creaminess
to
it
the
crispness
tames
with
time
but
theres
still
quite
a
hard
nip
even
going
into
a
slightly
drier
finish
overall
it
is
a
tasty
beer
and
worth
getting
again
o
overall
smooth
flavor
wise
some
oyster
but
wish
there
was
more
kick
a
good
stout
to
drink
anytime
it
brings
enough
roast
flavors
to
be
interesting
but
doesnt
have
a
super
high
abv
or
extremely
thick
body
drinkable
the
oysters
lend
just
a
tiny
bit
of
mineral
flavor
that
almost
reminds
me
of
collecting
seashellsbeing
by
the
sea
random
but
its
what
comes
to
mind
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
earthy
black
malt
scent
along
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
sweetness
there
is
a
creamy
character
that
really
enhance
the
dark
malt
feel
the
oysters
lend
a
bit
of
depth
to
the
aroma
that
really
rounds
out
the
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
earthy
black
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
there
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
in
there
as
well
that
provides
some
added
sweetness
and
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
terrific
seasonal
beer
its
quite
drinkable
and
is
full
of
flavor
poured
into
nonic
pint
glass
jet
black
with
a
thick
brown
head
that
dissipates
after

a

open
watery

finish
i
havent
had
oysters
before
but
i
dont
taste
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
or
shellfishy
in
this
beer
perhaps
its
in
that
sort
of
open
slipperiness
either
way
its
still
a
great
stout

o
never
been
too
impressed
w
flying

beers
this
was
different
definitely
buy
again
overall
good
overall
brew
refreshing
with
some
interesting
flavors
pours
a
dark
rich
black
depths
of
hell
tone
with
a
light
tan
head
even
lights
up
the
room
with
the
hop
of
pearls
trapped
in
your
oyster
however
i
have
find
myself
an
approachable
roasted
malt
accented
stout
aroma
has
hints
of
sea
salt
and
mineral
water
with
an
earthy
dark
roast
character
flavor
wise
we
dive
into
the
mix
of
dark
roasted
malt
bitterness
with
a
soft
chocolate
blanket
and
salty
earth
notes
a
bit
one
dimensional
but
a
drinkable
version
of
a
dry
stout
mouthfeel
is
medium
thin
at
times
compared
to
other
bigger
stouts
on
the
market
this
isnt
trying
to
be
that
its
a
middle
of
the
road
oyster
infused
dark
beer
thats
really
my
overall
impression
the
taste
is
absent
of
salty
shellfish
oyster
or
otherwise
what
i
found
was
nice
malty
chocolatey
taste
that
tended
towards
molasses
slightly
sweet
and
a
touch
dry
the
taste
is
easy
and
enjoyable
the
feel
is
watery
and
light
which
does
tend
to
the
ease
of
drink
but
does
not
lend
to
a
true
craft
beer
feel
the
pearl
necklace
oyster
stout
is
a
decent
light
abv
stout
the
beer
poured
a
opaque
black
with
egg
shell
white
head
that
is
leaving
some
lace
the
scent
has
nice
coffee
base
with
hints
of
semi
sweet
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
start
with
a
subtle
push
of
hops
then
the
coffee
flavors
kick
in
which
then
yields
to
a
sweet
caramel
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
body
with
very
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
very
good
session
able
stout
pearl
necklace
oyster
stout
pours
out
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
drops
to
a
cap
the
aroma
is
pretty
stouttypical
with
roasted
malt
and
sweet
chocolate
thankfully
the
taste
does
offer
a
bit
of
salty
brininess
that
too
many
oyster
stouts
miss
out
on
providing
a
great
amount
of
depth
to
the
chocolate
flavors
akin
to
a
seasalted
chocolate
bar
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
gently
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
good
overall
pearl
necklace
is
a
good
oyster
stout
o
this
is
just
a
nice
easy
drinking
stout
when
you
want
those
classic
stout
flavors
without
having
to
tear
into
a
thick
and
meaty
russian
imperial
or
american
double
simple
but
satisfying
this
is
the
frist
oyster
stout
i
have
had
and
it
just
taste
life
a
stout
thought
a
oyster
stout
tasted
diffrent
but
this
beer
pours
dark
with
a
big
head
nothing
more
i
can
stay
a
dark
beer
worth
drinking
yes
but
thats
it
drinks
dark
looks
darks
what
do
oyster
taste
like
because
its
not
in
this
beer
drink
this
beer
if
you
like
dark
beer
but
it
you
have
drank
oyster
stout
before
then
you
know
what
they
should
taste
like
and
i
think
there
better
ones
out
there
because
this
just
taste
like
a
regular
stout
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
thin
but
creamy
tan
head
aromas
of
roasted
meats
and
a
bit
of
salt
taste
begins
with
an
almost
briny
character
followed
by
a
savory
coffee
middle
and
an
earthy
coffee
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
overall
quite
a
good
beer
this
may
be
the
first
oyster
stout
ive
had
overall
a
nice
stout
with
plenty
of
rich
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
lot
of
great
art
on
the
cover
for
a
cover
of
a
semigood
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
were
this
the
1st
stout
i
ever
had
i
may
love
it
however
i
am
a
stout
porter
fan
so
i
naturally
feel
i
know
them
best
this
is
marginal
for
a
stout
and
a
slightly
tasty
porter
at
best
the
stouts
high
level
of
carbonation
dryness
and
hop
character
suggest
an
americanstyle
stout
as
opposed
to
more
supple
sweet
and
calmer
english
versions
those
need
the
salty
must
of
shellfish
for
balance
and
palatability
but
in
this
design
the
salts
exacerbate
much
of
its
already
overbearing
quality
overall
yes
two
of
my
favorites
dark
beer
and
oysters
very
tasty
obviously
it
would
compliment
seafood
and
i
think
any
dish
where
lemon
was
a
feature
oddly
enough
not
having
much
to
compare
it
to
in
the
oyster
stout
category
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
winner
my
bottle
says
4
7
abv
o
overall
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
some
fish
and
fries
went
nicely
nice
to
see
an
oyster
stout
out
there
and
this
is
a
nice
one
i
have
to
say
nice
little
sweet
thing
going
on
in
a
stout
kind
of
way
consistent
flavor
carbonation
seems
a
bit
high
probably
detracts
from
the
flavor
delivery
but
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
like
it
overall
this
was
very
good
and
quite
enjoyable
this
was
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
and
a
beer
that
id
seek
out
again
the
low
abv
made
this
go
down
very
quickly
and
it
is
a
definite
session
beer
to
me

crystal
clear
very
dark

with
a

khaki
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
spotty

clings
down
the
glass
aromas
of
milk
chocolate
cocoa
roasted

coffee
caramel
toast
toffee
light
oyster
and

very

and
earthy
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
damn
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
roasted
flavors
with
good
complexity
and
zero
cloying
flavors
present
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
creamy
and
lightly
slick
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
stout
nice
balance
and
robustness
of
roasted
flavors
and
really
easy
and
smooth
to
drink
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
particularly
light
oyster
stout
with
only
the
faintest
hints
of
the
salty
briny
mineralladen
overtones
that
most
have
go
on
slip
one
to
your
vegan
friends
good
color
a
bit
more
head
on
the
pour
would
be
nice
not
much
smell
of
the
oysters
and
not
much
in
the
taste
a
little
disappointing
since
it
is
prominently
displayed
on
the
bottle
balance
is
good
between
hops
malt
and
alcohol
good
roasted
notes
from
the
grain
without
being
overly
done
or
burnt
the
beer
is
black
with
a
half
inch
of
creamy
beige
head
that
coats
the
glass
with
filmy
lacing
the
aroma
offers
roasted
malt
biscuits
it
certainly
smells
like
an
english
stout
i
cant
detect
any
oyster
presence
in
the
aroma
or
the
flavor
but
perhaps
its
better
if
the
oyster
character
is
subtle
still
id
like
it
to
be
more
present
the
beer
tastes
fine
otherwise
light
to
medium
in
body
with
appropriate
carbonation
low
alcohol
and
well
balanced
what
it
lacks
in
character
it
atones
for
at
least
to
a
certain
degree
with
drinkability
a
good
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
d
good
to
try
the
sixer
will
be
enough
for
me
ok
brew
blind
id
think
this
was
porter
nice
aromas
decent
flavors
but
nothing
spectacular
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
small
foamy
tan
head
aroma
of
dark
malts
toasted
grains
unsweetened
cocoa
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
dark
malts
bitter
cocoa
toasted
bread
some
mild
leafy
and
earthy
hops
and
a
bit
of
mineral
from
the
oysters
that
was
really
more
implied
in
the
mouthfeel
than
in
the
taste
as
with
most
oyster
stouts
in
my
opinion
body
was
midrange
about
right
for
an
englishstyle
so
no
real
complaints
there
though
the
roastiness
added
a
little
oomph
pretty
good
overall
fuller
medium
body
milder
carbonation
creamy
and
full
on
the
tongue
the
chalky
mineral
tones
in
this
threw
me
off
a
bit
but
the
body
was
really
the
highlight
of
the
beer
drank
straight
out
of
the
bottle
from
a
flying
dog
variety
pack
another
great
offering
from
flying
dog
and
an
attempt
at
a
unique
maryland
style
brew
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
also
a
great
example
of
this
style
while
i
did
not
pair
this
with
seafood
i
would
imagine
that
this
is
a
great
beer
to
slug
down
along
with
some
crabs
and
oysters
flying
dog
pearl
necklace
oyster
stout
3
55
overall
a
pretty
typical
stout
i
cant
believe
im
writing
this
but
wheres
the
oyster
ahh
there
it
is
very
subtle
at
the
end
after
the
beer
warms
this
is
my
first
stout
brewed
with
oyster
so
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
coming
in
outside
the
aroma
its
nearly
nonexistent
is
this
a
good
thing
guess
ill
have
to
give
other
oyster
stouts
a
go
to
find
out
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
decent
enough
aroma
is
nice
the
brew
smells
like
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
some
coffee
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
the
oyster
mineralbrine
flavor
is
noticeable
its
a
sweet
smelling
brew
but
overall
the
flavors
are
more
bitter
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
it
has
good
carbonation
and
its
also
easy
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
and
id
try
it
again
in
the
future
this
beer
pours
up
a
beautiful
deep
black
with
a
one
finger
tan
colored
head
dissipating
to
a
thin
retention
ring
and
bits
of
lacing
the
smell
is
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
basically
follows
the
nose
it
is
malt
forward
with
toffee
cola
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
mouthfeel
is
full
and
satisfying
with
just
a
hint
of
oyster
aftertaste
this
one
surprised
me
it
was
much
better
than
i
expected
had
this
one
on
a
past
ticking
trip
to
asheville
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
massively
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
toasted
malt
subtle
salt
and
slight
cocoa
powder
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
toasted
malt
milk
choclate
powdered
chocolate
and
very
subtle
salt
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
an
oyster
stout
you
say
if
this
is
indeed
an
oyster
stout
where
are
the
oysterish
aspects
there
was
hardly
any
maybe
there
was
a
kiss
of
brine
but
that
was
about
it
im
sure
they
added
a
little
to
the
mouthfeel
but
i
would
have
loved
to
see
a
little
more
of
their
presence
after
having
had
a
few
good
examples
i
have
set
the
bar
pretty
high
with
these
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
there
are
other
better
examples
out
there
o
not
bad
i
think
i
have
been
a
bit
spoiled
on
founders
breakfast
stout
but
overall
a
good
above
average
beer
overall
eh
not
bad
not
extra
ordinary
but
easy
drinking
nice
and
dry
defiantly
be
one
up
on
a
guinness
t
im
actually
a
pretty
big
fan
of
this
beer
i
dont
get
a
ton
of
the
oysters
but
it
tastes
like
a
rich
irish
dry
stout
nice
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
char
some
faint
dark
chocolate
and
burnt
wood
on
the
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
salt
water
somewhere
in
the
burnt
wood
has
a
really
rich
mouthfeel
for
the
abv
worth
a
try
minerally
notes
are
present
but
chocolate
and
roast
malt
are
definitely
dominant
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
exceptional
i
think
this
is
a
tough
style
to
knock
out
of
the
park
for
sure
a
lot
goes
into
the
construction
of
an
ale
like
this
and
i
really
like
the
intention
the
oysters
and
probably
added
oatmeal
malt
grain
supported
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
nothing
really
steals
the
show
which
still
makes
this
a
very
round
and
excellently
sessionable
stout
beer
im
happy
with
the
few
i
still
have
in
the
fridge
overall
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
of
trying
this
beer
but
of
course
i
neednt
have
been
this
is
a
tasty
and
subtle
brew
with
a
wonderful
texture
and
good
drinkability
id
definitely
have
this
beer
again
o
a
very
nicley
balanced
oyster
stout
tasty
and
delicious
o
fairly
average
english
stout
here
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
and
a
huge
tan
head
that
persists
the
aroma
is
quite
earthy
and
roasty
with
hints
of
coffee
and
caramel
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
nice
roasty
chocolate
and
coffee
with
a
caramel
and
brown
sugary
sweetness
that
is
cut
down
by
an
earthy
almost
briny
flavor
hints
of
dark
tart
fruits
round
out
the
flavor
nicely
light
earthy
hop
bitterness
linger
long
into
the
finish
of
every
sip
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
tart
and
chewy
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
stout
but
like
other
oyster
stouts
ive
tried
i
have
to
ask
why
overall
it
is
ok
but
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
o
ive
always
consider
flying
dog
to
be
one
of
those
neither
totally
pleasing
nor
offending
breweries
that
surprises
the
hell
out
of
me
at
times
id
consider
this
one
a
pleasant
surprise
pours
a
rich
dark
brown
opaque
beer
great
thick
creamy
head
smells
faintly
of
roasted
malts
and
a
little
booze
tastes
of
roasted
malts
and
has
a
good
body
and
great
carbonation
if
you
likes
stouts
and
have
never
had
it
i
would
recommend
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
this
is
a
very
tasty
stout
the
beer
poured
a
minimal
head
that
reduced
to
a
thin
layer
it
is
a
pitch
black
color
with
no
clarity
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
as
the
beer
was
drank
i
pick
up
roasted
notes
bittersweet
chocolate
smoke
and
some
bready
notes
in
the
taste
and
smell
the
beer
is
smooth
gull
bodied
silky
creamy
and
low
to
medium
carbonation
oyster
stoits
are
delicious
and
happy
to
have
found
this
down
here
in
pa
since
i
never
see
it
in
six
packs
a
bottle
from
gator
beverage
pours
black
with
small
and
quickly
receding
head
aroma
of
roadty
smokey
chocolate
coffee
malt
light
flavor
with
hint
of
oyster
finish
was
not
expecting
to
get
that
flavor
orif
i
didto
like
it
but
it
is
awesome
very
interesting
dryish
finish
a
bit
effervescent
for
a
stout
but
really
fits
with
the
flavor
and
closer
to
a
porter
mouthfeeland
bite
balanced
flavor
on
the
roast
and
oyster
nice
drank
this
straight
out
of
the
bottle
but
poured
a
portion
in
a
glass
to
see
that
it
was
black
in
color
with
moderate
carbonation
flying
dog
forces
carbonation
in
their
brew
so
it
will
always
taste
fresh
if
bottled
recently
malty
notes
slight
coffee
taste
on
the
palate
switching
around
from
ipas
to
this
stout
makes
it
hard
to
suck
down
even
though
its
only
a
little
over
5
abv
its
not
a
session
beer
slightly
above
average
for
a
stout
what
a
wonderful
beer
i
dont
get
any
oyster
flavor
which
is
good
in
my
book
this
is
just
a
really
solid
very
drinkable
mediumlight
bodied
stout
love
it
will
have
to
pick
up
more
i
knew
i
would
be
ok
when
the
aroma
that
came
off
was
a
predominate
roastiness
no
fishiness
the
flavor
was
predominately
dark
roast
with
moderately
high
bitterness
they
did
a
nice
job
with
this
beer
as
the
strong
roastiness
in
not
tannic
or
burnt
there
a
unique
flavor
to
this
beer
that
i
just
cannot
describe
that
i
am
relating
to
the
oysters
cheers
im
not
gonna
make
the
obvious
joke
here
but
i
do
know
a
girl
whos
told
me
she
always
thought
shed
look
good
with
a
pearl
necklace
and
its
hard
to
keep
from
laughing
call
me
immature
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
wankhaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
watereddown
coffee
dark
earthy
greens
and
mineral
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
with
more
minerality
the
oysters
at
work
and
a
stiffer
coffee
component
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
a
nice
stout
though
one
that
could
stand
to
have
a
bit
more
meat
on
its
bones
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
ive
never
had
an
oyster
stout
but
for
only
5
5
this
baby
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
in
check
this
out
ive
never
had
oysters
but
this
is
good
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
something
different
in
your
stouts
overall
a
fairly
decent
stout
im
not
sure
what
the
oysters
really
add
here
except
a
bit
of
saltiness
still
its
a
well
puttogether
stout
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
o
quite
enjoyable
a
very
good
stout
that
stands
out
in
my
mind
wheres
the
oyster
though
maybe
it
adds
a
certain
je
ne
sais
quoi
maybe
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
an
english
stout
brewed
with
oysters
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
english
stouts
and
i
have
never
had
a
beer
with
oysters
in
it
before
but
it
seemed
to
fit
the
style
nicely
and
the
oysters
added
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
that
didnt
stick
out
too
much
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
went
down
smooth
and
the
flavors
held
my
attention
nicely
i
could
probably
drink
two
of
these
before
the
charred
flavor
would
be
too
much
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
appearance
it
tasted
pretty
good
with
some
nice
roasted
flavors
and
a
slight
briny
flavor
and
the
appearance
was
really
good
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
aroma
had
a
little
too
much
char
to
it
i
wouldnt
mind
the
char
being
toned
down
a
little
with
a
little
briny
aromas
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
when
looking
for
a
good
and
drinkable
english
stout
and
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
dont
let
the
oysters
scare
you
this
is
a
good
stout
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
have
to
admit
that
i
was
little
intimated
by
the
fact
that
they
threw
some
oysters
in
this
brew
but
it
turned
out
that
they
didnt
impart
any
fishy
aspects
to
this
beer
it
just
made
it
richer
and
added
a
slight
briny
flavor
to
it
which
i
liked
and
i
thought
it
worked
well
with
this
beer
good
job
flying
dog
at
first
glance
this
is
one
crazy
sounding
beer
but
once
you
get
down
to
it
and
drink
it
its
really
not
all
that
crazy
its
just
a
good
english
stout
nice
work
guys
ill
be
interested
to
see
what
other
crazy
ideas
you
guys
got
mouthfeel
is
light
and
thin
but
well
bodied
for
an
english
stout
i
guess
im
still
looking
for
a
real
oyster
taste
and
other
than
the
slight
gritty
rock
taste
midway
through
there
isnt
much
fizzes
a
bit
when
swished
but
more
foamy
than
harsh
drinkability
is
good
balance
of
flavor
and
thin
body
so
its
a
winner
there
at
least
overall
a
disappointment
great
balance
from
start
to
finish
very
subtle
oyster
shell
flavor
which
works
quite
well
this
beer
lingers
on
the
palate
wish
i
had
a
dozen
island
creek
oysters
right
now
on
its
own
still
a
lot
of
fun
one
to
seek
out
for
sure
a
case
worthy
brew
here
overall
good
beer
in
my
eyes
overall
drinkability
my
first
oyster
stout
certainly
not
my
last
overall
a
very
unique
experience
overall
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
overall
a
solid
addition
o
good
but
not
great
it
takes
a
while
for
the
oyster
flavors
to
become
noticeable
otherwise
it
tastes
like
a
fairly
average
stout
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
there
are
some
better
examples
of
oyster
stouts
out
there
my
first
oyster
stout
a
solid
effort
thin
dark
tan
head
with
little
retention
on
a
jet
black
body
almost
no
aroma
with
only
hints
of
chocolate
and
vanilla
flavor
is
a
little
tart
and
sour
for
the
style
mostly
from
the
roasted
malts
that
have
the
sourness
and
bitterness
of
stale
coffee
without
much
coffee
flavor
some
mild
sweetness
from
chocolate
and
hints
of
vanilla
medium

this
one
is
just
not

good

the

okay
beer
pours
well
into
a
pint
glass
with
ample
tan
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
like
oysters
to
their
beds
lazy
oysters
deep
brown
color
like
the
mud
of
the
rappahannock
doesnt
smell
much
but
i
didnt
ask
for
a
tasting
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
well
see
what
she
smells
like
after
a
few
gulps
roast
toasty
malts
remind
me
of
rich
breads
we
used
to
make
flavored
with
oyster
liquor
when
i
was
young
lots
of
chocolate
and
coffee
a
true
stout
dark
sugars
a
touch
of
char
cloyingly
drythese
are
all
my
favorite
things
about
stouts
what
a
tremendous
offering
from
fd
the
oyster
flavor
is
only
at
the
beginning
with
some
brine
lingering
to
the
end
adding
to
the
beautiful
balance
of
this
beer
still
doesnt
smell
like
much
served
too
cold
need
to
grab
some
bottles
and
take
them
home
to
do
it
right
find
a
shop
that
ships
worth
the
cost
enjoy
this
was
my
first
oyster
stout
and
it
was
quite
good
the
oysters
were
subtle
but
really
added
to
a
solid
english
stout
this
would
pair
well
with
food
or
by
itself
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a

pretty
steady
flow
of
small

bubbling
throughout

of

with
an
overall
toasty
feel
and
a

the

dark

profiles
are
deep
in
the

as
you
continue
to

and
allow
your

to
open
up

that
is
kept
with
both
a
touch
of

bitterness
and
the
carbonation
bittersweet
aftertaste
both
coffee
and
chocolate
leading
into
a
dry
clean
finish
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
not
bad
but
i
would
prefer
more
on
the
flavor
more
sweet
and
hop
balance
to
go
with
the
toasty
black
coffee
notes
one
of
the
best
flying
dog
beers
ive
had
very
easy
to
drink
could
use
a
bit
more
alcohol
but
overall
a
really
good
stout
o
aside
from
the
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
easygoing
beer
that
has
plenty
of
flavor
and
is
easy
to
drink
certainly
enjoyable
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark

small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the

on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
cookie
dough
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
burnt
cocoa
and
a
slight
fruity
flavor
there
is
a
medium
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
aromas
and
flavors
ofor
an
oyster
stout
where
are
the
oysters
maybe
i
cant
pick
out
oysters
but
i
cant
get
any
of
them
velvety
smooth
and
pleasing
in
the
mouth
flavorfully
flowing
over
the
taste
receptors
more
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
sensation
of
the
briny
depths
lite
chocolate
comes
through
again
tasty
stout
with
a
slight
edge
on
complexity
compared
to
the
run
of
the
mill
stout
well
worth
a
try
md
smooth
with
a
nice
flavor
not
simple
but
not
particularly
complex
i
wouldve
like
to
taste
the
oyster
a
bit
more
but
it
was
delicious
nonetheless
o
overall
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
the
oyster
stout
leaves
little
to
be
desired
except
for
a
higher
abv
to
compliment
the
style
o
this
is
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
at
first
it
seems
like
your
typical
stout
but
the
oysters
become
a
little
more
noticeable
as
the
beer
warms
up
it
is
definitely
very
easy
to
drink
am
easy
drinking
stout
not
great
but
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
did
at
least
see
some
of
the
oyster
aspects
of
this
one
notes
so
this
is
making
it
as
part
of
their
regular
lineup
ok
it
is
not
that
exciting
but
i
guess
this
could
work
well
this
beer
was
definitely
interesting
id
consider
buying
it
again
for
a
stout
its
priced
nicely
and
it
offers
a
pretty
good
kick
for
the
low
abv
o
there
is
a
slight
salinity
that
makes
itself
known
as
an
undercurrent
throughout
quite
a
good
beer
as
i
said
before
very
english
in
its
flavour
seriously
blind
i
would
never
think
this
beer
was
made
in
the
us
its
that
old
world
incredibly
english
even
if
the
shellfish
dont
jump
out
and
say
hello
moderate
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
i
think
that
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
its
different
and
i
would
have
to
get
more
used
to
it
and
try
more
from
the
style
to
determine
if
this
is
a
good
one
or
not
overall
not
so
long
ago
this
was
my
gateway
beer
into
porters
and
stouts
i
remember
being
blown
away
that
i
liked
it
so
much
i
hated
oysters
i
had
been
completely
underwhelmed
by
stouts
this
was
a
mix
of
the
two
and
i
was
scared
turns
out
it
would
be
the
first
5
i
ever
handed
out
on
ba
but
today
i
know
that
score
was
off
i
was
elated
i
had
broken
down
a
barrier
it
was
only
being
compared
to
about
20
other
beers
and
my
tongue
was
still
turned
off
by
anything
that
wasnt
light
and
at
least
semisweet
that
night
will
always
be
a
great
memory
and
the
bottle
from
that
moment
will
always
stand
in
my
halloffame
but
i
really
doubt
ill
ever
drink
this
for
any
other
reason
than
for
memorys
sake
its
a
good
beer
just
not
a
great
one
overall
pretty
good
for
flying
dog
o
i
liked
the
look
and
fragrance
of
this
beer
the
taste
didnt
live
up
to
other
sensory
perception
the
burnt
flavor
was
somewhat
offputting
very
nice
stout
with
a
difficult
to
place
extra
through
in
to
distinguish
it
from
the
crowd
not
bad
my
second
oyster
stout
and
im
starting
to
respect
the
style
wish
it
had
a
little
more
body
but
given
the
strength
its
not
unexpected
overall
good
balance
and
enjoyable
finish
might
have
this
again
this
was
a
nice
take
on
the
oyster
stout
style
with
a
no
shortage
of
flavor
from
the
oysters
while
still
keeping
the
overall
focus
of
the
profiles
on
those
more
aggressive
notes
from
the
hops
and
roast
a
nice
lively
body
on
this
really
makes
those
flavors
pop
as
well
im
glad
they
are
going
year
round
with
this
one
i
think
ill
picking
up
a
sixer
of
this
once
and
a
while
o
this
crazy
beers
is
really
like
having
liquid
smoked
oysters
at
first
i
was
unsure
and
a
tad
put
off
but
after
a
few
sips
i
enjoyed
it
more
and
more
a
great
idea
and
a
well
executed
stout
that
i
will
look
for
from
now
on
get
yourself
a
pearl
necklace
gents
and
enjoy
cheers
dark
brown
to
black
pour
an
almost
ruby
color
comes
through
when
held
up
to
light
very
little
head
and
disappates
quickly
smells
of
coffee
and
chocolate
taste
has
the
same
with
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
slight
saltiness
on
the
backend
beer
oysters
solid
good
o
this
beer
is
both
not
as
oystery
and
much
better
than
i
thought
surprisingly
nice
balance
between
acidity
and
malts
sweetness
and
bitterness
osmells
great
tastes
just
okay
its
definitely
a
very
drinkable
stout
one
that
i
wouldnt
even
mind
getting
a
6pack
of
not
getting
a
taste
of
oysters
here
not
sure
if
im
supposed
to
i
wasnt
really
expecting
to
o
the
flavors
really
came
together
for
me
but
everything
else
left
me
wanting
more
i
enjoyed
my
bottle
but
i
dont
think
id
be
in
search
of
this
one
again
poured
out
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
1
5
finger
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
minute
smells
and
tastes
just
like
any
other
stout
to
me
with
dark
roasted
char
blend
of
malts
perhaps
the
flavor
has
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
it
that
wasnt
in
the
nose
but
i
didnt
detect
any
of
the
brininess
that
i
had
heard
about
in
other
reviews
and
it
left
me
disappointed
it
certainly
has
a
light
and
smooth
texture
at
least
but
im
not
getting
any
oyster
excitement
in
this
oyster
stout
or
any
real
excitement
at
all
soft
dark
fruits
dark
chocolate
and
a
light
char
all
backed
by
an
interesting
but
not
unpleasant
briney
saltwater
quality
earthy
flavors
and
a
bit
of
bitterness
keep
it
multidimensional
as
the
glass
empties
dark
brown
but
not
quite
black
thin
tan
head
not
the
gimmick
i
was
expecting
i
love
oysters
ok
so
add
a
nuance
of
briney
sea
water
and
salt
to
an
english
stout
dominant
are
the
roastt
toasty
bread
crusty
coffee
and
chocolate
flavors
so
sessionable
too
smooth
roasty
palate
with
a
little
ocean
graininess
o
this
is
one
i
can
really
see
coming
to
its
own
on
tap
a
decent
nofrills
stout
with
great
intentions
id
pair
this
one
with
what
else
oysters
o
a
pretty
good
english
stout
but
nothing
like
i
was
expecting
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
oysters
but
i
found
myself
wanting
more
in
that
department
at
the
very
least
just
to
get
that
unique
flavor
unfortunately
it
wasnt
there
making
this
not
a
very
unique
beer
on
the
whole
still
i
enjoyed
it
a
positive
throwback
to
tradition
with
just
a
splash
of
innovation
o
i
would
say
this
is
an
above
average
lower
abv
stout
not
sure
what
the
oysters
do
but
they
are
not
really
noticeable
o
this
beer
does
showcase
the
oyster
shells
more
than
most
other
oyster
stouts
but
the
stout
itself
is
very
soft
in
malt
flavor
and
the
nougat
note
is
a
bit
off
overall
a
nice
drinkable
stout
good
earthy
flavors
and
a
reasonable
abv
worth
a
purchase
for
sure
this
is
a
rather
simple
one
dimensional
offering
its
not
a
bad
flavor
profile
but
it
doesnt
hold
my
interest
long
its
worth
a
try
but
theres
nothing
special
here
this
was
a
tasty
treat
and
its
great
to
see
an
oyster
stout
available
as
an
american
craft
beer
ill
have
another
o
not
a
style
i
often
drink
but
this
one
wasnt
bad
good
coffee
aroma
and
flavor
with
plenty
of
roasty
notes
i
was
expecting
something
unique
out
of
an
oyster
stout
but
this
one
drank
like
any
other
pretty
good
tasteroasty
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
subtle
brinyness
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
very
tasty
creamy
and
smooth
sessionable
worth
seeking
out
a
very
nice
stout
apparently
drinking
these
will
help
clean
the
chesapeake
by
putting
more
oysters
in
it
a
very
nice
cause
i
need
to
buy
more
of
this
to
support
it
the
well
developed
blend
of
tastes
is
what
should
entice
you
our
canine
friends
have
brought
together
a
nice
blend
of
malts
roastiness
and
hops
this
is
a
well
made
stout
that
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
again
leave
it
to
flying
dog
to
make
an
incredibly
risque
themed
beer
this
will
be
my
first
oyster
stout
pour
is
deep
dark
brown
with
fizzy
brown
head
with
out
much
staying
power
the
nose
features
earthy
notes
along
with
heavy
dry
roast
notes
of
chocolate
and
hints
of
smoke
come
through
as
well
a
touch
of
oyster
character
is
present
at
the
beginning
in
the
form
of
earthiness
otherwise
this
is
a
malt
bomb
taste
is
absent
of
anything
that
resembles
oysters
for
me
however
it
is
incredibly
chock
full
of
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
and
has
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
for
style
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
quite
a
tasty
stout
and
is
actually
quite
refreshing
as
i
drink
this
on
a
90
degree
summer
day
i
really
dont
get
much
in
the
way
of
oysters
im
really
not
sure
if
this
is
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
because
the
product
that
is
here
in
front
of
me
is
damn
tasty
d
nicely
done
the
malt
character
is
robust
but
not
cloyingly
so
and
there
are
smoky
earthy
flavors
that
define
this
as
a
special
kind
of
stout
and
one
that
would
go
well
with
oysters
this
is
a
very
dark
stout
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
quickly
i
smell
prunes
and
a
hint
of
malt
theres
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
like
fruit
but
it
finishes
dry
and
a
little
bit
salty
i
really
can
taste
the
oysters
in
the
finish
and
it
pleases
me
this
beer
feels
a
little
thin
for
a
stout
but
not
bad
i
will
look
for
this
again
come
football
season
o
its
an
ok
beer
its
fairly
mild
but
i
enjoy
the
finish
of
it
passable
but
not
exciting
it
seems
a
little
lighter
and
thinner
than
ideal
drinks
pretty
easily
though
really
not
bad
for
the
style
just
a
little
tick
down
from
the
better
ones
ive
had
on
tap
at
old
town
in
greensboro
yesterday
poured
a
deep
color
with
some
deep
ruby
hue
to
ita
thinner
khaki
colored
head
atop
chocolate
malts
and
dark
roast
in
the
nse
mainlyi
didnt
get
much
briney
flavors
compared
to
many
of
the
style
wich
didnt
bother
me
much
chocolate
flavors
with
a
little
saline
flavor
to
go
along
with
hefty
roast
lighter
but
pretty
creamy
in
the
feelprobably
something
that
would
go
well
thru
the
nitro
tap
not
bad
it
isnt
over
the
top
in
its
oysterbrine
flavors
not
the
best
stout
but
worth
trying
i
like
it
o
a
pleasant
oyster
stout
pearl
necklace
gives
a
nice
performance
even
if
not
all
the
instruments
are
in
tune
the
mouthfeel
is
too
light
and
the
finish
too
bitter
despite
these
offkey
notes
the
song
still
plays
well
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
enjoyable
a
solid
enough
brew
but
after
having
a
handfull
of
oyster
stouts
from
several
breweries
im
still
not
sure
oysters
really
enhance
anything
for
me
there
is
a
sweetness
to
the
taste
again
in
a
form
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
mocha
latte
the
malts
give
a
subtle
chocolatey
side
to
this
beer
with
some
pleasant
roasted
coffeelike
tones
mixed
in
in
the
back
is
a
touch
of
hops
and
maybe
even
a
little
saltiness
that
give
the
beer
a
bit
of
prickle
on
the
way
out
this
saltiness
is
subtle
but
definitely
there
a
touch
from
the
oysters
im
sure
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
somewhat
slick
and
this
is
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
stout
nothing
over
the
top
or
out
of
this
world
exciting
but
this
is
a
solid
stout
for
sure
definitely
worth
the
pick
up
overall
surprising
light
for
a
flying
dog
brew
most
of
their
beers
are
quite
harsh
but
this
one
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
in
the
grand
scheme
of
oyster
stouts
of
which
i
am
big
fan
this
one
sits
in
nicely
in
the
middle
while
nothing
wows
me
in
this
beer
i
will
gladly
reach
for
an
other
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
the
tasting
room
it
pours
a
lighted
black
if
thier
is
such
a
thing
not
as
dark
as
a
lot
of
stouts
ive
had
the
aroma
is
light
hints
of
roasted
coffee
and
very
subtle
hints
of
chocolate
i
didnt
get
any
real
oyster
flavor
in
the
beer
but
is
was
a
really
nice
smooth
stout
that
was
very
drinkable
its
not
over
the
top
on
abvs
like
a
lot
of
stouts
out
there
which
was
really
nice
for
a
change
got
a
six
pack
on
my
out
so
well
see
how
it
is
from
the
bottle
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
and
sweet
lactose
like
in
the
taste
sweet
roast
dry
lactose
sugar
and
a
small
saltiness
a
small
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
lactose
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
roast
and
flavor
but
kind
of
standard
for
the
style
beer
is
thin
and
creamy
sweet
light
on
the
palate
simple
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
i
enjoyed
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
soapy
khakicolored
head
aromas
of
dark
roasty
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
brine
taste
is
of
more
dark
roasted
malt
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
bit
more
salty
sea
water
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
quite
drinkable
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
easydrinking
stout
that
could
use
a
touch
more
oyster
character
but
nice
overall
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
the
head
is
thin
and
tan
in
color
there
is
no
retention
or
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
lightly
toasted
with
some
light
roasted
malt
aromas
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
subtle
bite
to
it
nice
light
chocolate
tones
with
a
creamy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
holds
a
decent
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
drinkable
and
pretty
good
from
start
to
finish
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
that
leaves
an
almost
silky
oily
feel
coating
the
inside
of
the
mouth
with
every
sip
however
it
almost
lacks
a
bit
in
body
and
gets
watery
towards
the
end
instead
of
carrying
the
expected
viscosity
of
an
oyster
stout
there
was
seemingly
no
alcohol
inclusion
and
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
certainly
worth
a
try
o
overall
a
decent
beer
though
i
thought
the
nose
was
a
bit
bland
a
12
oz
glass
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
as
well
but
a
sample
of
this
is
worth
checking
out
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
solid
stout
nice
roast
profile
and
easy
to
drink
o
went
well
with
my
various
food
items
crab
chowder
salad
crab
cake
sandwich
darn
i
hope
i
can
get
back
to
maloos
before
they
run
out
of
this
shrug
this
is
almost
more
like
a
dry
brown
ale
though
there
are
some
intriguing
additional
flavors
as
well
you
can
definitely
tell
the
alcohol
is
fairly
low
in
this
beer
and
frankly
given
the
abv
the
beer
delivers
an
impressive
amount
of
flavor
nevertheless
there
just
isnt
enough
going
on
in
this
beer
to
make
me
want
to
order
it
again
o
i
found
the
pearl
necklace
to
be
a
great
and
unique
beer
it
is
well
balanced
and
easily
drinkable
the
oysters
provide
some
interesting
earth
and
brine
notes
that
accentuate
the
beer
without
overwhelming
it
well
done
and
i
only
wish
that
itll
be
widely
available
in
the
coming
months
great
beer
for
a
great
charity
enjoyable
stuff
overall
a
good
lightish
stout
with
a
good
roast
and
chocolate
character
theres
a
reason
no
one
really
regards
oyster
stout
as
a
category
unto
its
self
despite
such
a
peculiar
and
distinct
brewing
process
more
often
than
not
there
is
markedly
little
to
distinguish
it
from
ordinary
stouts
that
being
said
this
beer
is
no
doubt
unique
and
should
you
find
yourself
in
san
francisco
one
you
should
definitely
make
a
point
to
try
d
this
really
missed
the
point
for
me
could
have
been
a
bit
more
fullbodied
i
found
no
distiction
from
adding
oyster
d
i
would
love
to
give
this
the
real
test
and
enjoy
with
oysters
otherwise
meh
despite
the
name
i
tasted
no
oysters
oyster
shells
calcium
or
saltiness
in
this
beer
tasted
like
a
conventional
stout
to
me
albeit
with
a
bit
of
a
noteworthy
alcohol
finish
on
the
back
end
head
was
non
existent
didnt
really
have
any
lacing
not
much
aroma
really
taste
was
pretty
good
and
fresh
as
it
should
be
from
the
tap
im
glad
theyre
brewing
this
true
oyster
stouts
are
few
and
far
between
and
i
would
certainly
have
another
glass
some
time
but
i
wont
miss
it
when
this
years
vanishes
from
the
tap
a
nice
strong
and
very
dark
virtually
black
english
ale
o
a
nicely
done
ale
not
even
close
to
being
a
stout
and
it
doesnt
claim
to
be
one
on
the
bottle
so
the
ba
type
is
wrong
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
slowly
and
appreciate
overall
is
it
a
stout
is
it
a
porter
this
is
a
beer
with
an
identity
crisis
in
more
ways
than
one
its
not
that
it
tastes
bad
i
like
my
beers
malty
and
this
one
isnt
too
bad
albeit
a
little
onedimensional
i
think
its
trying
to
be
two
things
at
once
and
doesnt
really
hit
the
spot
on
either
count
compared
to
something
like
sam
smiths
oatmeal
stout
bad
king
john
is
looking
pretty
woeful
not
a
drain
pour
because
i
enjoyed
the
taste
but
i
cant
see
me
seeking
this
out
again
o
hmm
could
i
have
bought
an
infected
bottle
not
sure
i
want
to
pay
2
for
another
bottle
to
find
out
if
this
is
bad
king
john
in
its
normal
state
then
its
one
of
the
worst
stouts
ive
had
very
very
decent
brew

an
ok
brew
more
of

than
a

not
roasty
enough
in
my
opinion
the
smell
is
nice
with
balanced
complexity
the
taste
is
less
pleasing
a
touch
too
much
roasted
malt
and
burnt
grain
crowd
out
the
other
flavours
resulting
in
an
excessively
dry

could
be
a

nothing

as
it

up
overall
a
good
tasty
brew
o
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
not
particularly
memorable
either
id
been
ready
to
write
off
ridgeway
based
on
rep
and
some
very
average
beers
this
earns
them
a
stay
of
execution
surprisingly
supable
probably
due
to
the
great
carbonation
making
it
an
easy
drinking
experience
oa
lot
of
potential
but
not
quite
there
maybe
a
stout
light
pours
a
brownish
red
with
minimal
head
turning
to
film
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
rich
sweet
roasted
malt
some
dark
fruits
and
maybe
some
plum
tastes
like
a
sweet
or
a
milk
stout
not
enough
hop
presence
or
any
complexity
really
not
bad
but
nothing
special
feel
is
a
bit
too
carbonated
at
first
again
nothing
special
here
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
buy
again
overall
quite
a
good
stout
better
than
guinness
anyway
would
i
have
another
one
absolutely
if
youre
buying
t
sweet
malts
well
balanced
toast
bitterness
at
the
end
long
final
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
residual
sweetness
overall
i
found
the
flavors
in
this
brew
good
but
was
disappointed
in
not
only
what
i
thought
was
a
missed
opportunity
at
larger
flavors
but
also
thicker
mouthfeel
still
this
might
be
a
good
introduction
to
black
ales
for
newcomers
as
it
does
provide
all
of
the
requisite
flavors
albeit
in
a
lighter
format
this
beer
was
a
thin
looking
deep
brown
color
with
just
a
bit
of
fan
head
across
the
top
the
lacing
was
nonexistent
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
nice
roasted
malt
aromas
but
they
werent
overly
strong
the
taste
was
pleasantly
light
and
had
some
flavors
in
it
that
i
was
having
trouble
pinpointing
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
i
didnt
mind
for
some
reason
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
stout
but
still
just
about
average
in
my
opinion
its
a
decent
stout
arguably
a
porter
it
was
black
showing
rusty
red
with
a
half
sip
left
id
give
it
another
shot
at
some
point
but
id
consider
it
a
semibland
table
beer
on
tap
at
tap
and
table
appeared
just
barely
black
with
red
highlights
this
stout
was
drinkable
and
true
to
style
but
uninspiring
the
character
is
flat
and
lacks
depth
theres
just
a
roasted
barley
taste
with
a
touch
of
dark
chocolate
yes
it
nice
yes
im
a
little
tough
on
this
beer
but
theres
a
lot
of
potential
for
this
style
d
roasty
yet
incredibly
smooth
for
flavor
making
for
a
solid
good
drinkability
factor
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
making
you
feel
like
you
are
drinking
a
session
style
pub
at
5
rather
then
a
tick
above
at
6
yeah
i
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
nice
typical
english
pub
setting
its
not
bad
easy
drinking
would
drink
again
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
and
probably
one
of
the
best
that
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
yet
i
dont
know
what
that
is
saying
but
there
you
have
it
the
beer
itself
is
a
bit
harsh
on
the
finish
but
it
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
would
i
seek
it
out
no
the
bastard
is
much
better
d
in
no
way
do
i
find
this
one
sessionable
but
who
says
thats
a
bad
thing
a
very
nice
brew
to
end
my
day
with
not
bad
not
great
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
periodically
but
im
not
disappointed
that
this
isnt
readily
available
where
i
live
this
beer
is
worth
bringing
home
but
be
wary
of
the
marketeers
mediumfull
body
with
a
dry
lightly
burnt
malt
bitterness
on
the
finish
d
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
a
unigue
experience
that
separates
the
english
stout
from
the
export
mild
but
no
diluted
good
retention
supriseingly
fruit
but
backbone
of
malt
molasses
the
palate
is
clean
and
not
creamy
but
broad
vanilla
cocoa
molasses
and
a
lot
of
blackberry
fantastic
mild
but
not
basic
overall
not
really
that
great
of
a
beer
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
yeah
lets
live
pessimistically
in
the
past
ridgeway
lets
keep
dredging
up
john
and
dragging
his
name
in
the
mud
real
mature
this
brew
pours
a
very
dark
brown
topped
by
a
sad
excuse
for
a
bubbly
head
its
not
its
fault
though
the
cask
affects
performance
the
nose
comprises
figs
black
grapes
light
maple
syrup
and
some
light
strawberries
the
taste
holds
notes
of
chocolate
powder
light
maple
syrup
figs
dates
red
grapes
and
a
hint
of
oak
wow
didnt
see
all
o
that
comin
the
body
is
a
solid
medium
with
no
real
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
feel
overall
a
better
time
is
had
with
this
beer
than
was
had
under
the
watchful
eye
of
the
eponymous
ruler
word
despite
all
the
faults
its
a
fairly
decent
and
quite
drinkable
session
stout
if
youre
not
looking
to
wreck
your
palate
with
a
roasted
malt
bomb
or
get
hammered
with
a
10
ris
drinkability
no
problems
finishing
this
one
could
have
cracked
a
few
a
more
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
overall
though
it
is
rather
smooth
this
beer
is
drinkable
by
all
means
i
wouldnt
really
call
it
a
stout
however
more
of
an
english
strong
dark
ale
i
have
to
say
the
label
has
caught
my
eye
in
the
past
but
i
never
pulled
the
trigger
until
todaybbc
magazine
called
him
the
worst
briton
of
the
13th
centurynow
thats
sayin
something

it

down

not
for
the
american
craft
palatebut
its
got
decent

some
bitter

and
fruity
flavors
meld
into
a
pretty
good
earthy
finishintense
finish
maybe
for
the
brits
i
actually
think
its
decentnot
intensenot
great
if
you
like
english
dry
stout
this
is
worth
checking
out
can
be
a
little
pricey
for
a
bottle
though
pours
black
with
a
khaki
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
subtle
with
roasted
malts
and
a
little
smoke
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
roasted
malt
being
the
most
predominant
flavor
component
the
hops
may
add
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
but
if
they
do
it
is
not
much
not
very
complex
but
it
is
enjoyable
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
i
would
have
considered
this
something
else
other
than
a
stout
maybe
a
dark
mild
but
it
is
not
real
mild
or
just
and
english
strong
ale
still
a
very
good
english
ale
i
feel
that
this
beer
tastes
and
looks
more
like
a
porter
than
a
stout
even
though
it
is
a
good
beer
it
is
a
bit
flat
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
actually
at
least
when
considering
the
high
price
it
cost
at
my
local
pub
from
premiere
gourmet
good
example
of
english
sublety
nothing
too
bold
just
the
balance
of
a
little
roast
a
little
shwartzbier
black
a
bit
above
mouthfeel
a
bit
of
licorice
as
in
a

nothing
harsh
delightful
with

meal
really
a
shwartbier
this
does
not
do
it
for
me
just
kind
of
bland
nothing
bad
but
there
are
much
better

from

shop
in

liquor
world
i
always
can
go
for
a
nice
dark

chose
such
to
follow
up

posed

bitterness
that
comes
in
in
the
midtaste
fairly
sweet
as
well
more
than
expected
this
is
a
satisfying
and
very
enjoyable
brew
a
beer
fit
for
a
bad
king
thats
for
sure
id
have
more
if
it
werent
so
damned
expensive
the
aroma
is
like
burnt
malt
with
cream
and
coffee
the
appearance
is
black
with
an
average
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
too
thin
for
a
stout
i
am
not
very
fond
of
this
one
i
cant
really
say
that
there
is
any
one
fault
with
this
one
overall
its
just
not
that
good
on
tap
at
deep
ellum
this
past
weekend
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
brown
color
to
the
body
decent
sized
head
not
a
lot
of
aroma
noticed
roasted
barley
flavor
was
there
but
not
a
lot
else
pretty
smooth
beer
so
i
found
quite
easy
to
drink
but
honestly
this
beer
did
nothing
for
me
and
seemed
run
of
the
mill
didnt
stand
out
in
any
which
way
ridgeway
bad
king
john
isnt
bad
in
a
good
way
and
it
isnt
bad
in
a
bad
way
its
a
slightly
better
than
average
black
beer
that
is
more
bitter
than
most
thats
probably
the
only
reason
why
this
hophead
is
giving
it
above
average
scores
no
how
no
way
is
it
worth
6

drinkability
very
nice
english
stout
do
away
with
that
metallic
beginning
and
lower
the
carbonation
a
touch
lower
and
you
have
almost
world
class
very
drinkable
as
is
though
overall
this
beer
is
quite
delicious
described
as
a
black
ale
on
the
bottle
it
is
as
fine
an
example
of
a
british
stout
as
ive
tasted
worth
a
try
the
taste
is
quite
interesting
flavourful
and
complex
up
front
it
starts
smoothly
with
sweet
fruit
especially
prunes
toasted
brown
bread
a
hint
of
fruitcake
this
gradually
transforms
into
a
drier
toastier
character
with
gradually
increasing
bitterness
including
pepper
and
spice
licorice
perhaps
and
light
hints
of
bitter
chocolate
and
unsweetened
coffee
the
change
is
smooth
and
gradual
to
a
lightly
bitter
dry
finish
containing
the
pepper
etc
the
bitterness
lingers
slowly
getting
a
little
stronger
to
fill
the
mouth
before
fading
hwoever
nothing
is
sharp
or
burn
tasting
the
bitterness
is
not
clinging
or
unpleasant
it
stops
just
short
of
getting
unpleasant
and
it
has
a
nice
spiceycoffee
character
the
whole
experience
is
enjoyable
engaging
interesting
very
flavourful
from
start
to
finish
and
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
the
taste
was
incredible
not
heavy
like
most
stouts
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
what
really
sets
it
apart
it
isnt
really
anything
new
or
unique
but
the
execution
is
just
superb
the
super
light
mouthfeel
was
quite
offputting
but
otherwise
a
rather
nice
beer
served
from
tap
by
the
brewer
himself
into
a
snifter
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
big
leather
and
dark
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
leather
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
was
really
surprised
by
the
leather
aspect
that
came
across
in
this
one
as
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
experienced
it
in
an
american
stout
where
it
wasnt
intentional
this
added
a
nice
level
of
complexity
to
the
brew
ontop
of
the
other
flavors
and
aromas
already
present
mouthfeel
was
a
little
better
than
most
i
have
had
in
the
style
as
most
feel
watered
down
worth
trying
if
you
go
to
the
brewpub
as
it
was
quite
enjoyable
pitch
black
creamy
tan
head
that
retains
well
the
nose
is
oatriddled
caramel
sweet
and
not
too
complex
flavor
is
the
same
way
not
necessarily
complex
but
delicious
amazing
for
the
price
smooth
and
creamy
feel
to
itoaty
finish
highly
enjoyable
as
well
ad
their
ipa
overall
impression
a
serviceable
stout
that
goes
down
just
fine
on
a
cool
winter
evening
my
overall
rating
here
is
somewhat
inflated
by
the
appearance
but
theres
no
denying
its
a
greatlooking
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
much
more
watery
than
expected
the
rough
edges
really
need
some
work
however
it
is
drinkable
and
would
offset
a
very
sweet
creamy
dessert
quite
nicely
on
draft
at
the
brewery
opaque
pour
almost
no
aroma
with
this
light
roasted
malt
some
coffee
roastedburnt
malts
very
little
if
any
chocolate
needed
just
a
little
more
of
pretty
much
everything
you
expect
from
a
stout
it
was
very
drinkable
however
of
the
3
i
sampled
this
was
probably
the
best
at
brbc
drinkability
enjoyed
this
one
decently
it
wasnt
anything
groundbreaking
or
amazing
but
its
a
solid
drinkable
reasonablyabved
stout
with
a
good
array
of
flavors
and
aromas
and
nothing
particularly
wrong
with
it
drinkability
solid
for
one
of
those
lessthansweet
stouts
d

this
beer
works
well
with
the
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
makes
is
easy
to
drink

its
hard
to

the
almost
slippery
feel
as
this
goes
down
does
have
a
very
nice
hoppy
finish
though
was
not
expecting
that
have
to
try
it
again
next
time
i
go
down
there
to
see
if
that

is
still
there

drinkability
not
bad
at
all
a
nice
dry
stout
with
an
earthy
finish
my
previous
growler
from
blue
ridge
produced
little
to
no
head
however
this
one
produced
a
nice
head
that
laces
well
and
leaves
a
little
film
down
the
glass
it
is
above
average
on
appearance
but
could
be
better
the
smell
is
full
of
chocolate
and
some
other
that
is
smooth
and
creamy
possibly
oatmeal
the
smell
could
be
stronger
though
to
be
considered
great
the
taste
is
also
nice
it
is
up
front
with
its
dark
roasted
and
chocolate
flavors
but
follows
closely
with
some
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
thick
there
is
a
good
body
for
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
nice
americal
stout
one
you
should
give
a
try
if
at
the
blue
ridge
brewery
the
growler
i
brought
home
was
the
first
samples
of
beer
from
the
batch
so
lots
of
little
yeasties
are
on
the
bottom
of
the
grolwer
i
dont
think
it
effected
the
taste
but
i
thought
i
would
throw
that
in
if
anyone
took
offense
to
my
review
cheers
dark
brown
with
thin
looking
body
that
allows
some
significant
light
to
penetrate
hmmthis
is
a
stout
light
aroma
minimal
roasted
malt
and
coffee
hint
of
semisweet
chocolate
light
flavor
low
bitterness
but
not
sweet
either
strange
light
thin
watery
body
what
a
waste
of
a
cool
name
hoppy
bitter
for
a
stout
that
probably
comes
from
the
low
malt
profile
for
a
stout
claims
to
be
a
tropical
style
stout
but
not
having
had
a
tropical
style
stout
before
im
not
sure
what
that
means
it
had
a
good
head
o
enjoyed
and
would
get
it
again
i
generally
dont
like
magic
hat
but
this
is
my
favorite
chocolate
stout
its
widely
available
in
the
winter
and
incredibly
smooth
every
time
i
see
a
sixpack
i
buy
one
its
good
my
favorite
every
day
stout
and
their
best
beer
and
they
are
not
making
this
winter
immediately
one
of
my
favorites
pours
black
aroma
is
roasty
bitter
chocolate
coffee
taste
is
biscut
dry
and
bitter
with
a
light
mouthfeel
no
booze
aftertaste
is
coffee
my
guess
of
6
abv
is
close
to
the
actual
5
7
so
no
surprises
there
but
it
is
still
balanced
overall
this
is
very
good
and
an
easy
drinker
a
great
beer
for
a
nice
price
and
availability
pours
a
nice
black
with
a
coffee
colored
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
the
smell
was
full
of
malt
and
sweet
scents
the
taste
was
great
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
almost
fruity
notes
on
the
end
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
as
well
overall
i
would
recommend
for
stout
lovers
as
a
nice
beer
to
have
in
between
the
harder
to
find
and
more
expensive
stouts
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
char
and
slight
cocoa
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
char
cocoa
and
dark
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
has
a
slightly
better
set
of
flavors
in
my
opinion
ferrous
quality
dies
and
subdues
a
bit
as
it
warms
quite
an
interesting
stout
though
o
an
excellent
example
of
this
category
o
a
very
solid
stout
that
stands
out
only
by
being
so
true
to
style
and
refined
o
underwhelming
disappointment
of
a
beer
that
i
had
high
hopes
for
i
dont
normally
trust
magic
hat
to
put
out
a
high
quality
brew
but
i
was
hoping
this
one
might
be
different
based
on
reviews
and
scores
ive
read
however
there
wasnt
enough
boldness
or
richness
of
flavors
i
expect
in
a
high
quality
stout
that
coupled
with
too
many
off
aromas
and
flavors
force
me
to
give
this
brew
regrettably
low
marks
black
as
can
be
right
out
of
the
bottle
smells
strongly
of
cocoa
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
better
than
that
it
tastes
exactly
the
way
youd
expect
off
your
nose
flavors
are
overall
mild
and
a
perfect
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
great
stout
will
pick
up
again
this
ale
pours
a
handsome
but
unremarkable
near
black
with
a
slight
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
and
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
that
of
dark
chocolate
vanilla
beans
and
light
coffee
notes
the
flavor
is
mild
but
enjoyable
with
all
the
flavors
promised
in
the
nose
plus
some
dried
prune
and
raisin
notes
it
has
a
lighter
body
than
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
stout
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
drinks
quite
light
and
easy
it
is
in
no
way
a
great
stout
but
it
is
solid
overall
its
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
definitely
something
i
would
drink
again
overall
excellent
english
stout
nobrainer
for
a
session
brew
overall
definitely
a
quality
brew
although
not
in
the
same
league
as
say
the
stouts
by
founders
lagunitas
or
samuel
smiths
but
pretty
close
brought
this
on
my
skiing
excursion
to
share
with
friends
figured
they
like
it
and
it
was
a
huge
hit
its
an
inkyblack
brew
with
a
small
offwhite
lasting
head
this
beer
is
very
roastedsmelling
and
it
seemed
to
perfectly
match
the
snowy
woodsy
outdoors
at
the
ski
resort
the
taste
is
lightly
bitter
up
front
then
the
toasted
malts
take
over
bringing
some
sweetness
in
its
big
enough
for
what
we
wanted
without
being
too
heavy
probably
the
perfect
beer
for
that
moment
and
just
a
really
good
easydrinking
stout
this
one
is
a
winner
i
highly
recommend
o
a
good
easydrinking
dinner
companion
stout
overall
a
nice
beer
became
more
flavorful
and
balanced
as
it
warmed
overall
one
of
top
3
favorite
dry
stouts
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
i
decided
to
buy
a
six
pack
while
brewing
my
own
irish
stout
for
inspiration
so
to
speak
it
did
not
dry
my
mouth
out
and
was
very
flavorful
it
wasnt
as
smooth
as
a
guinness
draft
but
it
was
smooth
i
cannot
say
anything
about
its
appearance
because
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
but
the
taste
made
it
disappear
this
is
one
of
the
better
darker
stouts
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
the
coco
tones
are
perfect
and
the
taste
has
a
slight
sweetness
which
opens
up
on
your
tongue
and
lingers
leaving
your
mouth
feeling
warm
if
you
enjoy
the
darker
side
of
beer
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
was
hopeful
the
beer
did
not
really
have
much
of
a
smell
to
me
maybe
coffee
hits
the
beer
was
smooth
but
i
got
to
say
for
a
stout
it
was
pretty
tasteless
and
i
thought
a
bit
thin
good
lacing
was
present
but
i
prefer
taste
i
will
not
buy
again
found
myself
trying
this
for
the
first
time
a
few
weeks
ago
being
a
winter
seasonal
and
man
is
this
a
great
winter
beer
then
a
week
later
all
i
wanted
was
this
specific
taste
dark
toffee
thick
feeling
quality
nice
sharp
finish
one
might
think
this
was
an
imported
english
stout
would
love
to
drink
this
and
hobgoblin
at
same
time
and
compare
not
weak
either
surprisingly
buzz
worthy
but
better
to
drink
before
any
other
beer
as
this
taste
truly
needs
to
be
appreciated
to
its
fullest
great
contrast
to
magic
hats
other
orange
lemony
zest
beersipas
which
i
find
typical
amongst
others
definitely
a
stand
out
brew
im
pretty
much
a
stout
junkie
and
this
is
a
very
good
one
would
definitely
get
again
i
love
the
label
artwork
i
have
a
heart
of
darkness
and
that
eye
can
see
it
through
my
chest
o
i
like
this
stout
its
interesting
if
not
great
id
be
happy
to
drink
more
than
one
in
a
row
and
would
be
happy
to
serve
it
friends
i
know
some
people
swear
by
this
beer
and
i
wont
go
that
far
but
id
certainly
say
that
it
is
quite
solid
home
tasting
12oz
bottle
into
tulip
glass
12914
pours
a
pitch
black
in
color
with
almost
a
1finger
beige
head
that
settles
down
to
just
a
thin
ring
around
the
top
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
but
not
a
lot
actually
the
aroma
is
of
sweet
roasted
malts
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
black
coffee
the
taste
is
even
better
and
very
so
smooth
perfect
blend
of
tasty
flavors
perfect
carbonation
no
bitter
or
bitter
aftertaste
for
this
one
a
fantastic
stout
all
the
way
a
respectable
stout
with
bold
flavors
decent
allaround
character
overall
i
was
not
expecting
this
from
magic
hat
one
of
their
better
beers
great
taste
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
im
liking
this
a
lot
a
worthy
brew
am
not
enjoying
this
out
of
balance
overly
rooty
stout
sorry
i
took
a
friends
recommend
on
this
one
and
bought
the
whole
six
root
beer
stout
float
anyone
as
for
the
alcohol
its
here
but
this
was
about
an
easygoing
a
stout
that
ill
ever
have
even
though
i
only
had
one
bottle
of
this
i
could
easily
have
another
in
a
sitting
and
hardly
feel
buzzed
from
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
breakfast
stout
or
a
replacement
for
your
morning
cup
of
joe
look
no
further
this
wont
win
any
awards
but
it
just
might
win
me
back
to
magic
hat
even
after
all
of
these
years
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
the
smooth
texture
and
great
appearance
safe
and
good
my
third
beer
reviewed
from
magic
hat
and
one
of
my
favorites
had
this
straight
out
of
the
bottle
the
color
was
what
youd
expect
as
dark
as
dark
can
be
puffy
tanish
head
smooth
smokey
flavor
that
youd
expect
from
a
stout
average
body
for
an
american
stout
if
youre
looking
for
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
or
something
of
that
nature
o
not
a
bad
stout
the
flavor
really
saves
the
nose
and
appearance
though
rjt
initially
thought
this
was
a
bit
watery
and
not
very
complex
after
thinking
it
was
a
russian
imperial
definitely
fits
into
the
english
stout
category
and
a
damn
good
one
nice
black
pour
and
you
can
see
its
a
bit
thinner
almost
leaning
to
the
porter
side
smells
of
roasted
coffee
but
not
overpowering
and
a
slight
burnt
chocolate
taste
similar
with
a
nice
balance
of
smooth
coffee
not
too
bitter
nice
finish
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
as
i
have
said
my
only
knock
against
this
stout
is
the
slightly
high
carbonation
if
let
sit
until
slightly
above
room
temp
heart
of
darkness
takes
on
a
different
characterit
becomes
a
little
more
rich
and
the
hidden
flavors
become
more
evident
i
didnt
detect
the
bourbon
flavor
right
away
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
interesting
dry
and
lots
of
bitter
roast
quality
not
terrible
but
also
not
something
i
can
see
myself
returning
to
have
again

very
good
bordering
on
excellent
recommended
for
any
porter
or
stout
lover
the
dark
malts
and
coffee
are
the
welcoming
ingredients
in
the
flavor
but
it
does
not
take
long
for
a
notable
dry

bitterness
to
emerge
at

and
speak
for
the
stout
on

it
really

the

i
like
my
english
stouts
to
taste
overall
a
fine

overall
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
remarkable
for
nice
oatmeal
stout
and
the
price
makes
it
even
sweeter
i
would
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
when
i
poured
this
it
has
a
black
as
night
body
with
a
small
tan
head
that
lays
down
quickly
to
a
thin
tan
lace
the
aroma
has
a
malt
chocolate
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
a
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
to
start
then
the
chocolate
and
some
coffee
notes
come
in
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
really
smooth
imo
perfect
for
a
stout
overall
this
is
a
really
good
stout
overall
a
great
stout
easy
drinking
overall
i
like
it
it
is
a
good
stout
and
i
would
buy
it
again
by
far
magic

best
brew
most
of
them
are
boring
to
downright
offensive
this
is
downright
tasty
drinkable
and
even
a
bit
complex
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
stout
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
when
the
temperature
begins
to
drop
o
a
really
nice
easydrinking
stout
i
could
put
down
a
lot
of
this
and
really
enjoy
myself
light
to
medium
body
medium
effervescence
dry
throughout
with
just
a
faint
hint
of
warming
pretty
bitter
and
a
lot
less
body
than
a
stout
should
have
otherwise
a
really
nice
brew
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pub
glass
this
is
a
very
mild
light
stout
its
mildly
sweet
and
malty
without
much
complexity
aside
from
a
bit
of
subdued
chocolate
it
would
be
tolerable
for
a
newbie
but
probably
a
bit
of
a
let
down
for
someone
who
actually
enjoys
stouts
that
have
kick
not
a
whole
lot
going
on

a

with
a
good
amount

only
a
slight

after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
stout
great
balance
of
roasted
flavors
with
good
robustness
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
highly
enjoyable
offering
o
i
loved
the
smell
of
this
one
but
i
am
more
partial
to
the
smoother
stouts
that
are
out
there
i
was
a
little
put
off
by
the
bitters
left
in
the
finish
i
would
prefer
a
sweeter
finish
to
my
stout
still
had
a
good
nose
and
taste
up
front
overall
i
can
recommend
this
and
i
would
reach
for
another
i
would
look
for
this
if
i
were
in
the
mood
to
sip
a
rich
brew
on
a
cool
evening
overall
a
very
nice
stout
not
to
aggressive
a
very
good
stout
for
someone
who
normally
drinks
lighter
beers
and
wants
to
try
something

lots
of

in

heart
of
darkness
is
a
solid
black
ale
with
a
generous
soft
light
brown
head
that
has
outstanding
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
is
kind
of
tangy
with
a
fair
amount
of
dark
roast
theres
a
note
of
caramel
and
some
sort
of
spice
its
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
thats
pretty
clean
it
tastes
pretty
dry
and
roasty
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
it
is
pretty
tangy
but
not
fruity
there
are
notes
of
caramel
and
vanilla
a
light
resiny
bitterness
lingers
for
a
bit
after
the
swallow
this
is
a
really
solid
offering
from
magic

i
can
down
a
6pack
of
this
with
no
hesitation
overall
this
is
pretty
good
and
better
than
i
expected
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
stout
its
well
balanced
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
prefer
imperial
stouts
but
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
english
stout
o
a
very
delicious
stout
and
well
balanced
its
not
overly
complicated
but
contains
a
great
amount
of
character
the
ingredients
compliment
each
other
without
trying
to
overpower
each
other
flavors
of
chocolate
milk
carob
slight
amount
of
roast
barley
and
ash
in
the
taste
as
well
mellow
and
fairly
smooth
light
carbonation
slight
astringency
its
good
nothing
groundbreaking
though
ill
probably
reach
for
local
options
before
this
id
drink
it
again
and
seek
out
a
fresher
sample
next
time

the

smells
like

bittersweet

a
bit

i
think
the
taste
is
pretty
much
just
like
the

although
the
dark

flavor
is
a
bit
stronger
its
also
more

also
with

an

like
this

its
quite

also

this
stout
has
an
excellent
nearblack
opaque
appearance
there
seems
to
be
some
carbonation
here
the
initial
pour
produces
a
huge
khaki
colored
fluff
and
the
bubbles
themselves
are
dense
like
sea
foam
this
later
goes
down
but
not
completely
theres
always
a
little
cover
over
the
dark
beer
bonus
points
for
that
the
aroma
is
a
breeze
of
pure
bliss
through
my
nostrils
its
main
characteristics
are
vanilla
cream
milk
chocolate
and
sweetened
coffee
however
good
it
is
fairly
straight
forward
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
good
balance
between
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
aspects
that
slight
fruit
flavor
so
telling
of
a
magic
hat
brew
is
here
of
course
too
it
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
the
finish
has
a
roasted
flavor
and
a
dry
effect
to
it
overall
its
a
nice
stout
that
goes
down
easy
when
youre
not
in
the
mood
for
a
big
beer
o
overall
a
good
bold
flavor
bitter
dark
burnt
roasted
nature
and
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
magic
hat
taste
is
a
little
more
straightforward
roasted
malt
upfront
the
cocoa
presence
is
much
lighter
in
flavor
than
it
is
in
aroma
burnt
malt
bitterness
and
a
slight
metallic
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
body
is
surprisingly
thin
with
a
carbonation
that
just
seems
too
aggressive
overall
a
style
you
dont
find
too
often
but
happy
to
have
enjoyed
this
regional
brew
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
willibecker
one
of
the
original
brews
that
got
me
into
craft
back
in
the
day
so
lets
see
how
it
has
held
up
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
quarter
inch
fizzy
tancolored
head
nose
reveals
roast
lactose
sweetness
and
a
metallic
aroma
towards
the
back
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
there
is
also
an
acidity
that
cuts
through
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
carbonation
that
falls
just
short
of
lively
acidity
is
light
but
lingers
along
the
taste
buds
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
between
quaffs
overall
this
beer
has
held
up
pretty
well
considering
the
last
time
i
had
it
was
in
the
mid
90s
that
said
its
definitely
not
as
robust
as
i
recall
but
a
respectable
beer
nonetheless
overall
i
actually
am
glad
the
local
recommended
this
beer
pretty
darn
delicious
i
would
definitely
try
this
beer
again
everything
seemed
to
somewhat
surprise
me
about
this
one
highly
recommended
to
anyone
who
wants
a
good
stout
to
enjoy
this
is
terribly
easy
to
drink
while
5

abv
isnt
exactly
session
material
it
goes
down
so
easy
with
a
smooth
character
that
youll
want
and
be
able
to
have
quite
a
few
of
these
really
a
nice
rendition
of
an
english
classic
anyone
know
why
this
is
categorized
as
an

pk
12oz

the
beer
poured
out
promising
looking
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
small
head
the
aromas
were
dominated
by
the
carbonation
at
first
but
opened
up
into
chocolate
and
coffee
upon
prolonged
inspection
the
taste
was
somewhat
disappointing
to
me
as
the
coffee
toffee
and
chocolate
flavors
were
nice
and
clean
but
they
felt
diluted
due
to
the
thin
and
tinny
mouthfeel
i
m
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
a
case
of
what
could
have
been
verdict
i
would
have
another
oquite
liked
this
despite
not
being
the
biggest
fan
of
the
stouts
its
up
there
with
some
of
the
greats
o
great
stuff
especially
for
the
price
could
be
better
if
it
was
a
little
less
bubbly
o
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
stouts
was
it
discontinued
for
a
while
a
highly
drinkable
stout
especially
for
those
who
like
a
smokey
aftertaste
certainly
one
of
the
better
mh
offerings
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
used
to
always
buy
the
mixed
seasonal
12
packs
but
havent
lately
worth
trying
for
sure
overall
a
very
well
put
together
stout
the
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
along
with
the
smokeyness
give
it
a
very
interesting
and
warm
feel
its
a
winter
seasonal
through
and
through
meant
to
be
had
on
a
cold
night
overall
at
first
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
beerit
sorta
does
taste
like
a
home
brew
which
is
fine
but
i
expect
a
bit
more
from
a
fairly
large
brewery
like
magic
hatalthough
i
kinda
feel
like
all
magic
hats
taste
the
sameanyway
the
warmer
this
gets
the
better
it
tastesthe
chocolate
and
coffee
come
out
of
hiding
and
make
this
a
much
more
pleasurable
experience
than
when
it
was
cold
out
of
the
fridgea
very
pleasant
chocolate
coffee
and
malt
aroma
is
there
tooso
much
better
im
still
gonna
give
this
a
2
but
if
its
served
closer
to
room
temp
it
could
be
a

overall
not
bad
not

at
all
surprised
from
magic

these
days
most
of
their
beers
seem
to
really
have
gone
downhill
and
this
is
the
brewery
that
got
me
into
craft
beer
so
it
was
hard
for
me
to
see
them
fade
out
this
is
nice
good
malts
mostly
dark
malts
without
much
char
although
there
was
a
slight
metallic
flavor
nice
touch
of
smoke
and
just
a
faint
hint
of
cocoa
that
i
would
have
liked
to
come
out
more
and
hops
are
very
light
which
i
also
would
have
liked
ot
see
more
otherwise

coffee

roasted

all
the
way
with
a
rough
but
creamy

excellent
stout
bittersweet
chocolate
upfront
is
balanced
by
the
bitter
finish
loved
it
o
a
fruity
and
soft
stout
with
light
bit
of
sweetness
but
a
bit
more
bitterness
the
dark
fruit
from
the
malt
blends
well
with
the
citrus
and
grapefruit
from
the
hops
making
for
a
sort
of
juicy
stout
id
call
this
a
foreign
extra
stout
for
bjcp
style
nice
when
did
we
get
to
start
using
quarters
of
a
percent
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
and
different
example
of
the
style
it
had
some
decent
roasted
and
oat
flavors
to
it
with
some
great
complexity
and
a
fitting
mouthfeel
that
made
it
fairly
memorable
this
beer
had
pretty
good
drinkability
it
was
pretty
smooth
and
the
flavors
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
could
see
drinking
a
couple
of
these
but
after
that
the
thickness
might
become
too
much
its
a
good
late
fall
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
pretty
well
done
and
very
pretty
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
nice
but
it
was
just
a
little
thin
and
it
lacked
the
tons
of
rich
and
roasted
malts
that
i
normally
find
in
the
style
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
in
fact
i
already
went
back
to
the
store
and
bought
another
six
pack
its
reasonably
priced
and
a
decent
tasting
oatmeal
stout
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
even
though
i
was
told
it
was
good
i
always
have
my
doubts
with
magic
hat
but
this
one
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
surprise
and
it
showed
me
that
magic
hat
can
actually
make
a
decent
beer
good
job
guys
if
you
start
making
more
beers
of
this
quality
i
may
actually
end
up
becoming
a
fan
one
day
cheers
cheers
o
an
absolutely
excellent
stout
that
i
recommend
everyone
give
a
try
its
not
insanely
strong
theres
no
alcohol
taste
just
beautiful
creamy
coca
goodness
i
dont
always
like
magic
hat
especially
their
ales
but
this
one
was
spot
on
to
my
taste
o
just
a
really
nice
well
rounded
stout
that
makes
a
great
replacement
for
howl
hopefully
it
will
stick
around
for
a
while
i
think
that
beer
nerds
will
be
happy
that
it
is
back
it
was
certainly
nostalgic
for
me
to
finally
buy
some
magic
hat
again
this
is
not
particularly
dark
but
its
better
than
the
current
average
magic
hat
beer
its
nicely
roasty
with
some
nice
chocolate
i
had
this
on
tap
about
a
month
ago
and
i
remember
it
being
better
than
this
bottle
thus
im
being
slightly
generous
with
my
scores
great
job
delicious
get
some
could
it
be
the
first
beer
from
magic
hat
that
actually
impressed
me
most
things
have
been
average
so
i
actually
put
back
the
sixer
in
favour
of
a
single
might
have
to
revisit
lol
pours
almost
pitch
black
but
it
is
a
very
very
dark
reddish
brown
nice
frothy
tanmocha
head
that
diminishes
to
leave
a
nice
thin
layer
of
foam
with
very
nice
lacing
it
smells
of
roasted
and
burnt
malts
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
hops
there
is
a
lot
of
that
burnt
malt
taste
up
front
that
fades
to
coffee
and
cocoa
and
finally
bitter
hops
it
is
moderately
heavy
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
mouth
feel
is
creamy
then
dry
as
the
hops
dominate
the
palate
overall
very
good
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
in
the
magic
hat
winter
sampler
pack
i
bought
this
heart
of
darkness
for
a
pie
recipe
that
i
got
off
magic
hats
website
the
pie
was
great
but
the
beer
isnt
as
bold
as
i
would
expect
from
something
called
the
heart
of
darkness
the
color
is
an
almost
opaque
with
a
nice
slight
crimson
tint
the
smell
is
nutty
maybe
some
hazel
nut
and
chocolate
malt
the
taste
nutty
and
smokey
but
it
quickly
wanes
to
a
watery
nothing
i
wish
this
was
bolder
and
packed
a
little
more
of
a
punch
over
all
its
not
worthless
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
however
i
usually
want
something
bolder
and
more
flavorful
heart
of
darkness
has
a
beautiful
deep
brown
pour
that
borders
on
black
the
aroma
is
also
very
nice
theres
a
solid
amount
of
roastiness
with
chocolate
coffee
and
oatmeal
tones
behind
it
the
taste
has
a
well
integrated
roast
and
oatmeal
thing
going
on
at
first
with
some
herbal
hops
in
the
background
more
coffee
tones
come
through
on
the
finish
with
a
bit
of
chocolate
backing
up
everything
the
mouthfeel
could
be
a
little
smoother
but
is
spoton
with
the
thickness
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
stout
very
enjoyable
a
damn
fine
beer
ill
have
to
see
if
they
have
sixers
of
this
one
at
my
local
store
o
a
very
solid
english
stout
the
roasty
notes
help
to
keep
sweetness
to
a
minimum
and
make
the
drinkability
even
better
the
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
are
very
pleasant
as
well
one
of
my
favorites
from
mh
this
was
one
that
i
was
pretty
glad
that
they
rereleased
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
a
thin
cream
colored
head
on
top
the
retention
is
very
thin
with
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
te
beer
has
a
nice
aroma
of
toasted
oats
and
other
roasted
malts
the
taste
has
a
nice
rich
roasted
flavor
to
it
the
oats
shine
really
well
in
this
beer
there
is
a
subtle
chocolate
note
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
not
overly
thick
but
nicely
carbonated
and
drinkable
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
magic
hat
in
a
long
time
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
i
was
hoping
for
just
a
little
more
smoothness
in
the
body
and
a
little
more
complexity
to
the
flavor
heart
of
darkness
pours
solid
black
a
finger
and
a
half
or
so
of
mocha
foam
crowns
the
beer
even
managing
to
spill
out
of
the
glass
a
little
bit
the
nose
is
very
nice
based
around
a
roasty
coffee
aroma
theres
also
a
noticeable
smell
of
star
anise
that
joins
the
picture
the
flavor
profile
starts
out
similarly
well
with
the
taste
of
coffee
thats
had
a
bit
of
cream
added
to
it
the
anise
is
a
bit
more
muted
here
drowned
out
somewhat
by
a
slightly
jarring
hop
presence
the
bitterness
clashes
with
the
roasty
malt
character
and
the
earthy
herbal
finish
is
a
little
bit
overbearing
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
little
bit
short
of
great
the
body
is
a
hair
too
dry
and
the
carbonation
is
noticeably
zippy
both
are
just
off
though
i
have
to
say
im
pleasantly
surprised
by
heart
of
darkness
given
my
lack
of
fondness
for
many
of
the
other
magic
hat
brews
ive
had
this
one
is
pretty
solid
decent
brew
but
the
acrid
character
hurts
the
experience
along
with
that
stale
hop
character
pours
jet
black
ring
of
brown
foam
layer
remains
on
top
big
rich
roasted
nose
espresso
loaded
dark
chocolate
too
creamy
roasted
flavor
dry
finish
very
flavorful
ever
so
slight
bitter
in
the
close
quite
tasty
magic
hat
really
pulled
this
one
off
this
is
pretty
good
overall
not
sure
if
id
go
back
to
it
a
lot
but
definitely
quality
o
as
a
beer
its
one
i
wouldnt
turn
down
but
wouldnt
seek
out
as
a
stout
a
little
disappointing
for
me
reminds
me
more
of
a
dark
english
ale
o
this
was
the
first
engkish
stout
that
i
have
tried
its
a
very
interesting
style
i
was
quite
surprised
how
tart
it
was
and
the
charred
notes
were
certainly
noticeable
pretty
interesting
and
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
o
really
not
bad
at
all
i
tend
to
avoid
magic
hat
but
this
ones
goodcheap
enough
for
me
to
possibly
consider
getting
a
6
pack
of
this
one
pours
dark
with
a
nice
head
that
lasts
the
smell
is
roasted
coffee
chocolate
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
a
roasted
flavor
and
chocolate
a
bit
of
sweetness
is
a
nice
addition
body
has
a
creamy
feel
magic
hat
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
a
drinkable
and
flavorful
stout
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
got
it
on
sale
for
31
i
expected
it
to
be
more
drinkable
for
a
stout
but
it
is
definitely
on
the
savory
side
it
is
a
great
winter
beer
for
the
fireside
and
a
pipe
omagic
hat
mad
a
great
beer
something
of
theirs
i
fully
enjoyed
keep
this
up
magic
hat
o
very
lovely
stout
it
isnt
overbearing
in
anyway
if
a
high
alcohol
taste
and
over
the
top
burnt
flavor
is
more
your
style
this
isnt
it
but
its
a
great
balanced
beer
overall
nice
easy
stout
not
overpowering
roast
or
bitterrness
nice
dark
color
balanced
mouthfeel
i
decided
to
buy
the
magic
hat
winterland
12
pack
which
comes
with
four
different
magic
hat
brands
i
went
for
the
stout
first
since
i
really
like
stouts
and
the
flavors
induced
inside
them
for
a
stout
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
flavors
and
this
did
disappoint
me
a
little
bit
it
does
have
that
nice
coffee
roasted
stout
flavor
but
i
was
expecting
a
better
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
was
a
little
bland
but
i
do
like
the
first
initial
flavor
of
coffee
notes
this
stout
is
a
good
fast
sipper
though
because
most
stouts
are
high
in
alcohol
and
this
one
isnt
overall
this
is
a
good
stout
but
not
one
i
would
buy
on
a
regular
basis
i
would
prefer
sierra
nevadas
narwhal
imperial
stout
i
poured
this
average
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
very
gark
and
poured
a
really
dark
head
i
was
hopeful
the
beer
did
not
really
have
much
of
a
smell
to
me
maybe
coffee
hits
the
beer
was
smooth
but
i
got
to
say
for
a
stout
it
was
pretty
tasteless
i
thought
good
lacing
was
present
but
i
prefer
taste
i
will
not
buy
again
o
a
decent
stout
not
over
the
top
or
very
interesting
but
solid
d
the
acidity
of
the
roast
is
a
bit
too
much
for
me
both
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
unfortunately
unenjoyable
not
a
stout
i
would
revisit
overall
id
recommend
it
as
a
casual
beer
but
nothing
that
ill
savor
every
sip
of
this
was
a
well
flavored
beer
with
a
huge
coffee
presence
its
also
easy
to
drink
this
would
make
a
really
good
stout
for
a
session
its
also
reasonably
priced
making
it
a
first
choice
for
me
when
i
want
a
sixer
vs
a
bomber
o
being
a
stout
guy
i
cant
take
this
as
my
favorite
but
being
a
stout
guy
i
could
take
this
a
few
rounds
instead
of
sacrificing
myself
to
guinness
or
a
cheap
shitty
light
beer
its
smooth
has
a
moderate
abv
and
is
light
enough
to
knock
a
few
back
it
wasnt
satisfying
enough
to
have
just
this
one
but
ill
remember
it
the
next
time
i
plan
on
getting
fired
up
overall
watery
and
lots
of
roasted
patent
malts
poured
deep
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
dissapated
quickly
smells
roasted
and
sweet
taste
is
a
creamy
sweetness
that
follows
into
some
hop
bitterness
and
lots
of
roasted
malts
roasted
burnt
flavors
that
lingers
long
after
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
carbonation
that
tingles
the
tongue
but
not
too
much
overall
a
solid
stout
that
leaves
you
wanting
another
sip
soon
after
the
last
very
good
and
recommended
magic
hat
really
outdid
themselves
with
this
brew
a
decent
stout
thats
tasty
and
balanced
id
pick
up
a
6
a
beer
i
hope
to
definitely
buy
again
overall
the
beer
lies
somewhere
between
stout
and
porter
and
that
will
delight
lovers
of
both
i
found
this
a
nice
sippable
beer
but
without
any
hint
of
alcohol
very
quaffable
i
think
the
complexity
will
satisfy
the
lover
of
porters
and
a
stout
drinker
will
clearly
enjoy
the
richness
this
is
not
winter
aleor
a
spiced
ale
by
any
means
but
a
really
solid
hopped
stout
otons
of
roasted
malt
but
isnt
overwhelming
at
all
still
well
balanced
and
layered
really
delicious
stout
definitely
not
bad
but
very
standard
i
would
have
liked
a
bigger
mouthfeel
and
some
coffee
notes
in
addition
to
the
chocolate
worth
trying
overall
a
very
well
constructed
stout
a
very
pleasant
winter
treat
overall
i
drained
my
pint
without
realizing
it
especially
since
i
brewed
a
java
stout
and
remarked
on
how
similar
mine
was
to
it
without
the
java
flavoring
knowing
that
stouts
are
dark
derrrr
this
one
was
exceptionally
inky
black
i
loved
it
enjoyed
while
sitting
by
the
fire
pit
on
a
clear
cool
night
i
recommend
it
really
nice
to
see
this
beer
back
great
name
too
the
beer
is
dark
dark
black
perfect
for
a
cold
day
aroma
is
rich
with
malt
and
black
really
appealing
nose
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
a
stout
just
enough
thickness
just
enough
drinkability
flavors
are
rich
roasty
inviting
challenging
this
beer
is
really
nice
o
this
is
a
really
good
stout
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
magic
hat
o
its
a
little
above
average
i
cant
think
of
better
stouts
in
this
category
o
i
must
confess
that
im
really
not
a
fan
of
magic
hat
in
general
in
my
opinion
they
spend
far
too
much
time
and
effort
on
the
marketing
of
what
is
usually
very
mediocre
beer
this
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
departure
for
them
and
im
glad
it
took
guts
for
a
brewery
that
normally
sticks
with
very
safe
crowdpleasing
beers
to
release
an
oatmeal
stout
as
their
main
winter
seasonal
they
didnt
hold
back
either
its
very
flavorful
and
robust
so
much
so
that
it
isnt
hard
to
imagine
the
casual
beer
drinker
being
a
bit
overwhelmed
by
it
it
seems
to
be
selling
very
well
though
and
even
the
twelve
packs
are
moving
a
laudable
effort
from
magic
hat
i
hope
this
will
be
around
for
years
to
come
this
stouts
got
the
heft
and
the
appropriate
body
but
its
way
too
spritzy
the
finish
also
goes
astringent
i
can
take
a
little
crispness
in
a
stout
but
it
never
abates
here
i
would
absolutely
buy
this
again
heart
of
darkness
is
a
lovely
surprise
from
the
boys
up
in
burlington
wish
there
were
more
of
these
in
my
fridge
o
good
solid
oatmeal
stout
overall
solid
nice
dry
stout
with
good
taste
but
why
is
this
a
seaonal
nothing
at
all
suggests
holiday
in
this
brew
but
its
good
unfortunate
they
limit
its
availability
o
delicious
and
satisfying
stout
somewhat
warming
very
enjoyable
and
one
of
the
best
stouts
ive
had
a
goto
brew
for
me
in
the
winter
months
im
not
sure
this
is
so
sensational
but
its
certainly
a
deeply
flavorful
brew
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
grapevine
liquors
in
denver
overall
a
great
stout
i
am
quite
surprised
at
how
much
i
like
it
o
pretty
tasty
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
you
could
certainly
do
worse
the
strengths
of
this
brew
are
its
bitterness
and
aroma
the
weaknesses
are
its
bitterness
and
its
overcarbonationmouthfeel
the
head
made
me
think
it
would
be
a
bit
thicker
and
creamierlesser
carbonated
but
that
was
not
that
case
o
this
beer
came
out
swinging
but
lost
a
punch
or
two
later
in
the
game
i
enjoyed
the
experience
but
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
very
impressive
endeavor
by
the
guys
in
vermont
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
my
purchase
of
this
and
would
definitely
drink
it
again
i
am
always
iffy
about
some
of
the
magic
hats
i
try
but
i
definitely
did
not
go
wrong
with
this
one
this
is
an
extremely
well
crafted
stout
has
more
going
on
in
the
nose
than
on
the
palate
but
still
tastes
great
its
hard
to
live
up
to
that
wonderful
aroma
probably
the
best
showing
by
magic
hat
in
the
last
5
years
excluding
the
1st
rerelease
of
blind
faith
nice
flavor
profile
and
a
solid
showing
overall
not
the
best
in
the
style
but
probably
the
best
thing
magic
hat
has
on
the
market
currently
tasty
bitter
and
another
interesting
beer
from
magic
hat
however
i
was
disappointed
im
a
stout
fan
but
this
lacked
some
of
the
sweetercoffee
like
after
tastes
that
you
find
in
more
traditional
stouts
always
worth
a
try
from
this
brewery
but
i
think
ill
stick
with
shakespeare
overall
its
not
going
to
be
my
go
to
oatmeal
stout
but
its
the
best
thing
this
company
made
that
i
tried
plus
the
cover
art
is
pretty
schweet
o
never
been
a
big
fan
of
mh
they
make
soso
stuff
imo
this
was
actually
pretty
tasty
and
a
play
it
safe
oatmeal
stout
that
stay
true
to
the
style
awesome
looking
label
and
artwork
by
the
way
overall
this
is
a
solid
enough
beer
but
it
doesnt
terribly
stand
out
to
me
above
average
but
not
exceptional
overall
this
is
a
fine
stout
and
one
of
magic
hats
best
beers
is
it
worldclass
no
but
its
worth
looking
for
12oz
bottle
pours
velvety
out
of
the
bottle
jet
black
huge
rocky
tan
head
holds
great
retention
leaves
tons
of
lacing
on
the
glass
a
full
nose
rich
roasty
chocolate
faint
fruitiness
tastes
are
robust
with
dark
chocolate
roasted
barley
french
roast
coffee
oatmeal
a
little
smoky
a
little
fruity
kind
of
ashy
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
creamy
medium
bodied
well
balanced
finishes
clean
with
some
lingering
roast
overall
wow
nice
surprise
might
be
the
best
oatmeal
stout
ive
had
and
is
definitely
the
best
magic
hat
offering
ive
had
overall
not
a
bad
stout
interesting
hop
character
and
a
good
malt
base
i
recommend
letting
this
warm
up
alittle
before
partaking
httpwww

comkajiisbeerreviews
o
not
very
impressed
pretty
harsh
for
an
oatmeal
stout
heart
of
darkness
pours
like
it
sounds
nice
and
black
with
just
a
sneeze
of
dissipating
head
the
nose
lacks
a
robustness
but
lends
roasted
grains
and
dark
syrupy
notes
it
hits
the
tongue
at
first
slightly
sweet
but
in
the
end
a
brackish
bitter
cocoa
nib
nips
your
tongue
a
solid
medium
body
with
a
gentle
creamy
texture
give
this
beer
an
easy
swallow
overall
this
beer
is
quite
the
average
stout
for
me
it
does
have
a
really
good
score
on
ba
though
so
perhaps
its
on
tap
where
it
shines
well
i
still
like
it
is
it
as
good
as
it
used
to
be
i
have
no
idea
i
may
have
rated
it
higher
a
while
back
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
i
didnt
rate
it
when
i
had
the
chance
but
its
still
a
nice
rendition
of
an
oatmeal
stout
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
beers
magic
hat
is
currently
putting
out
its
good
to
see
the
hypnotic
eye
in
my
fridge
again
meeemoriiees
as
the
name
would
suggest
it
pours
black
with
a
nice
bit
of
head
that
lingers
well
the
smell
is
very
coffeelike
with
some
smoke
in
other
words
delicious
like
the
smell
the
taste
is
rich
and
coffee
or
maybe
even
espressolike
heavy
in
flavor
and
that
flavor
is
wonderful
leaves
a
nice
smokey
after
taste
overall
a
wonderful
stout
highly
recommended
12
oz
bottle
pours
an
opaque
black
with
nice
fluffy
head
aroma
is
light
smoke
coffee
cocoa
and
playdough
taste
is
smokey
malt
french
roast
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smooth
with
bitter
bite
to
finish
overall
im
not
a
big
magic
hat
fan
but
this
fairly
standard
stout
is
very
well
done
overall
magic
hat
just
started
distributing
to
my
area
and
ive
been
eager
to
give
their
beers
a
try
my
first
one
hasnt
disappointed
and
they
are
very
competitively
priced
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
their
beers
for
sure
im
just
slightly
disappointed
this
is
only
a
seasonal
as
i
would
pick
it
up
throughout
the
year
not
the
best
stout
and
not
the
best
priced
but
if
i
couldnt
find
my
gotos
id
be
more
than
content
with
this
45
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
appearance
the
coloring
was
deep
while
the
head
showed
great
retention
with
many
bubbles
remaining
until
the
very
last
drop
the
nose
was
full
of
notes
but
we
found
them
to
be
a
bit
subdued
collectively
the
taste
followed
in
very
much
the
same
vein
with
the
flavoring
being
inclusive
but
not
as
entirely
robust
as
hoped
for
the
feel
however
was
silky
and
smooth
to
fit
the
style
but
not
enough
to
make
you
forget
in
full
the
duller
aroma
and
flavoring
nose
is
sweet
light
coffee
milk
chocolate
sugar
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
pretty
mild
dark
malts
coffee
almost
like
coffee
grounds
milk
chocolate
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
and
just
a
bit
of
vanilla
bean
it
has
a
medium
body
with
a
light
but
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
definitely
a
lot
better
than
the
last
magic
hat
brew
i
had
9
pale
ale
light
roasted
coffee
bitterness
up
front
smooth
blend
of
dark
chocolate
milk
chocolate
and
peaty
malt
fill
up
the
palate
dark
chocolate
and
cocoa
nib
bitterness
into
the
finish
hints
of
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
linger
mediumfull
body
with
a
nice
smooth
creamy
feel
very
nicely
done
might
be
the
best
magic
hat
beer
ive
had
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
as
they
advertise
silky
smooth
and
luscious
medium
to
full
body
mild
soft
carbonation
long
bittersweet
finish
this
is
maybe
the
best
beer
that
ive
ever
had
by
magic
hat
ill
be
getting
more
of
it
and
itll
be
the
first
time
ive
bought
magic
hat
for
myself
in
quite
some
time
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
nonic
jet
black
pour
with
a
2
inch
white
head
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
full
of
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
very
roasty
pleasantly
bitter
it
finishes
with
a
lingering
bitterness
medium
in
body
and
well
carbonated
a
very
solid
offering
from
magic
hat
very
enjoyable
overall
3
5
good
milk
stout
no
way
this
is
an
oatmeal
stout
perhaps
some
type
of
melding
of
the
two
styles
i
e
by
adding
lactose
to
a
light
oatmeal
stout
regardless
this
is
a
smooth
and
easydrinking
stout
that
does
not
have
certain
stout
flavor
profiles
that
may
intimidate
some
people
very
easydrinking
had
no
trouble
putting
away
three
of
these
bad
boys
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
became
a
permanent
offering
overall
a
pretty
impressive
brew
from
magic
hat
has
an
authentic
stout
taste
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
im
gonna
have
to
try
this
with
a
scoop
of
french
vanilla
ice
cream
and
maybe
some
raspberries
yup
i
think
i
just
found
desert
this
was
the
perfect
beer
for
today
i
wish
i
could
find
a
perfect
beer
everyday
o
this
is
a
rich
tasting
oatmeal
stout
that
is
deceptively
easy
to
drink
the
only
drawback
is
it
seems
that
it
could
have
used
more
flavors
of
roasted
malts
overall
this
is
a
very
pleasant
drinking
stout
but
a
bit
too
roasty
and
hoppy
for
my
preference
for
an
oatmeal
stout
needs
more
oats
to
create
than
silky
body
which
is
necessary
for
a
true
winner
in
this
category
this
is
a
solid
tasty
ungimmicky
beer
and
if
this
brewery
would
make
more
like
it
i
would
buy
their
products
more
than
just
rarely
everything
a
stout
should
be
grab
some
this
winter
i
recommend
giving
this
a
go
its
a
very
different
and
creative
take
on
the
style
now
time
for
some
swordfish
looking
forward
to
my
fiances
arrival
worldclass
stout
right
here
happy
halloween
drink
good
beer
overall
the
best
magic
hat
beer
i
have
tried
by
far
tons
of
flavor
and
a
great
mouthfeel
make
for
one
amazing
stout
definitely
pick
this
one
up
if
you
have
the
opportunity
good
punch
of
bitter
coffee
up
front
followed
by
roasted
malt
with
some
slightly
sweet
molasses
notes
which
all
but
hidden
in
the
lively
dance
of
carbonation
finishes
with
a
smooth
coating
of
chocolate
bitter
and
a
little
dry
this
is
a
delicious
beer
o
good
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
highland
black
mocha
stout
i
had
last
night
the
magic
hat
stout
has
a
more
obvious
hop
presence
a
trace
of
sour
and
a
touch
more
carbonation
but
is
slightly
less
rich
and
complex
tasterich
roasted
coffee
dark
chocolate
faint
smokiness
and
tangy
hop
prescence
dry
roasty
finish
not
as
creamy
as
some
oatmeal
stouts
but
every
bit
as
flavorfull
with
a
drier
finish
match
up
with
some
burgers
or
bbq
yum
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
any
timid
drinker
who
wants
to
try
their
first
stout
some
beers
are
just
cool
and
this
is
one
of
them
as
oatmeal
stouts
go
you
wont
find
a
heartier
pour
my
bartender
commented
when
she
started
the
tap
wow
thats
dark
it
is
smooth
to
drink
just
a
little
bitter
on
the
edges
and
an
all
around
quality
beer
o
i
prefer
drinking
this
from
the
bottle
as
opposed
to
from
a
glass
but
at
any
rate
its
still
the
best
magic
hat
beer
ive
ever
had
got
the
case
on
clearance
for
15
99
and
its
definitely
an
amazing
value
at
that
price
overall
a
quite
tasty
and
balanced
stout
at
only
5
7
abv
the
blend
of
flavors
and
their
transitions
are
all
very
nice
i
wonder
if
ol
joe
conrad
is
getting
royalty
checks
regardless
this
stuff
pours
a
bleak
mahogany
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
darkness
eh
not
quite
buddy
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
toasted
oats
and
a
touch
of
coffee
there
we
go
back
on
track
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
everything
is
now
overly
roasted
andor
toasted
dammit
at
least
its
not
all
bad
this
time
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
finish
overall
a
schizoid
little
stout
one
thats
too
thin
and
too
roasty
for
its
own
good
this
is
an
okay
brew
but
i
believe
there
are
much
better
oatmeal
stouts
to
be
made
its
not
creamy
or
delicious
merely
an
average
representation
of
style
i
could
not
drink
two
back
to
back
recommended
but
tame
your
expectations
odreally
solid
oatmeal
stout
i
will
have
no
problem
blowing
back
all
6
of
these
one
of
magic
hats
best
offerings
not
too
sweet
which
i
am
happy
about
oh
so
solid
one
of
the
better
magic
hats
certainly
better
than
joseph
conrads
book
havent
seen
this
offering
yet
from
mh
so
picked
up
a
sixer
of
it
pours
a
jet
black
with
tannish
head
nice
roasty
aroma
taste
is
medium
bodied
a
bit
bland
nice
mouthfeel
but
i
feel
its
a
bit
lacking
taste
not
overly
hoppy
but
doesnt
have
the
usual
nuttiness
of
an
oatmeal
stout
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
one
rated
so
high
seems
like
an
average
drinkable
stout
to
me
nothing
too
special
about
it
pours
pitch
black
with
a
large
very
fine
creamy
tan
head
excellent
retention
and
wonderful
lacing
smell
is
rather
subtle
roasted
coffee
notes
and
caramel
maltiness
slightly
alcoholic
taste
is
good
roasted
bitterness
and
a
lot
of
caramel
malty
sweetness
slight
chocolate
and
alcohol
notes
at
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
a
medium
to
full
body
mouthfeel
is
wonderful
creamy
and
smooth
finishes
with
a
good
bite
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
is
a
great
stout
different
from
the
usual
suspects
most
people
think
of
for
the
style
but
definitely
well
within
the
style
guidelines
definitely
recommend
and
i
will
be
having
this
again
overall
a
nice
robust
roasty
stout
magic
hat
in
colorado
nice
this
must
be
newish
from
them
havent
seen
it
before
it
pours
a
shockingly
black
color
dense
as
hell
no
light
getting
through
this
baby
theres
a
bubble
mocha
head
on
it
about
an
inch
to
an
inch
and
a
half
tall
and
some
nice
sticky
lacing
it
smells
really
basic
no
chocolate
no
espresso
none
of
the
frills
just
really
dark
bitter
malt
and
some
decent
bittering
hops
the
flavor
is
also
much
without
the
extras
although
i
do
taste
some
dark
cocoa
in
there
there
is
a
great
bitterness
from
the
malt
and
a
ton
of
body
but
not
sugar
from
the
oats
good
carbonation
and
melty
smooth
texture
havnt
had
a
lot
of
good
dark
beers
from
magic
hat
before
this
one
but
this
i
can
really
get
into
a
perfect
winter
seasonal
its
an
english
stout
love
them
found
it
and
love
a
the
name
heart
of
darkness
great
color
a
taste
of
burnt
vanilla
wonderful
taste
that
gets
better
as
you
drink
a
touch
of
bitterness
thats
goes
down
smoothed
wonderful
color
great
head
hardly
any
lacing
a
beer
that
works
go
enjoy
it
good
marks
for
drinkability
went
down
nicely
if
i
were
close
enough
to
magic
hat
id
get
a
growler
for
sure
grabbed
a
growler
of
this
after
they
tapped
the
last
keg
for
the
season
out
of
the
glass
and
into
another
this
brew
was
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
wood
stain
meniscus
thin
one
finger
head
of
tan
foam
aromas
of
coffee
milk
chocolate
and
hints
of
vanilla
flavors
were
similar
chocolate
roasted
malt
sweetened
coffee
and
grainy
oats
in
the
finish
very
smooth
drinking
but
the
body
seems
a
bit
light
for
the
style
still
a
good
oat
stout
and
glad
i
picked
it
up
bottle
opened
with
a
big
hiss
and
when
poured
seems
a
bit
over
carbonated
pours
a
nice
black
with
slight
brown
highlights
on
the
edges
creamy
tanish
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
this
beer
smells
amazing
dried
plums
and
raisins
chocolates
coffee
taste
is
creamy
smooth
chocolate
some
coffee
some
fruits
a
little
bit
of
oxidation
but
not
horrible
and
a
strong
roasted
grain
that
lingers
at
the
end
body
is
medium
and
mouthfeel
is
creamy
i
was
surprised
at
how
well
this
one
held
up
given
that
its
at
least
2
years
old
and
low
on
the
alcohol
side
i
would
have
loved
to
tried
this
fresh
yet
another
great
brew
that
magic
hat
wrongly
decided
wasnt
worthy
i
could
drive
back
today
for
more
of
the
heart
this
beer
was
a
classic
back
in
the
day
either
my
palate
has
changed
since
its
retirement
or
the
recipe
has
disappointing
to
say
the
least
considering
how
happy
i
was
to
hear
of
its
return
verdict
i
didnt
even
realize
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
an
oatmeal
stout
its
not
bad
but
not
the
best
ive
had
still
quite
solid
ive
had
this
12
ounce
bottle
sitting
in
my
house
for
quite
some
time
now
and
figured
there
was
never
going
to
be
a
time
where
the
occasion
seemed
appropriat
enough
for
me
to
open
it
so
i
said
the
hell
with
it
open
it
whenever
you
feel
like
it
and
thats
what
i
felt
like
tonight
pours
a
nearly
pitch
black
color
slightly
brown
towards
the
top
with
a
nice
white
lace
for
a
head
aromas
that
surfaced
were
nice
cocoa
milk
coffee
toffee
very
truffle
oriented
taste
was
about
as
nice
as
it
comes
with
a
stout
caramel
milk
chocolate
espresso
burnt
coffee
bean
cherries
tobacco
it
never
seemed
to
end
on
new
tastes
to
come
up
with
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
light
bodied
for
an
oatmeal
stout
but
that
was
not
a
bad
thing
made
it
more
drinkable
in
the
end
i
never
thought
that
this
beer
would
age
well
but
after
all
of
this
time
sitting
above
my
fridge
i
have
found
that
it
has
grown
to
be
a
beer
to
be
revered
in
every
respect
of
the
word
i
have
to
admit
as
i
was
pouring
it
into
the
h
o
d
tulip
glass
i
felt
like
i
was
saying
goodbye
to
an
old
dear
friend
i
have
a
feeling
that
one
of
these
days
ill
stumble
upon
this
beer
in
a
dusty
corner
somewhere
but
if
not
it
was
great
getting
to
know
it
this
was
probably
the
first
stout
that
really
got
me
engorged
in
the
style
shame
on
mh
for
discontinuing
it
as
close
to
sacriledge
as
you
can
get
with
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
cheers
mouthfeel
is
chewy
slightly
sweet
robust
a
tad
bit
thin
slight
bit
of
bitter
hops
and
slick
butter
resound
when
the
last
bottle
of
this
is
gone
i
shall
be
quite
sad
it
is
a
shame
this
was
discontinued
decent
stout
this
beer
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
rapidly
disappearing
light
tan
head
the
nose
has
earthy
chocolate
tones
with
a
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
this
is
not
a
powerful
stout
but
it
is
not
a
weak
one
by
any
means
it
has
the
classic
coffee
chocolate
caramelized
flavors
that
you
would
expect
from
a
stout
although
it
is
a
bit
thin
feeling
it
has
a
slight
carbonization
which
i
appreciate
this
beer

note
as

reach

just

is
excellent

and
unless
theres
more
than
just
the
basic
elements
in
them
this
is
actually
a
good
drinking
stout
reminiscent
of
some
of
the
lighter
dry
irish
stouts
taken
in
that
context
with
the
dryness
of
this
beer
both
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
right
on
i
just
expected
a
bit
more
body
in
the
mouth
this
beer
may
be
the
heart
of
darkness
but
it
really
lights
up
my
heart
a
very
enjoyable
brew
that
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
a
dual
thanks
goes
out
on
this
one
one
to
deb
for
beering
this
forward
to
me
and
a
second
to
loren
for
providing
a
few
more
to
enjoy
later
cant
beat
great
bas
they
make
every
beer
more
enjoyable
after
having
written
the
review
just
below
for
the
bottled
version
i
went
to
my
favorite
beer
bar
and
found
the
draught
version
and
immediately
asked
for
a
pint
i
have
to
say
and
the
rest
of
the
draught
reviews
seem
to
agree
that
the
draught
version
is
similar
in
all
respects
except
the
flavor
and
aroma
the
flavor
is
milder
and
smoother
and
the
hop
flavor
takes
over
the
hints
of
chocolate
and
coffee
seem
to
be
lost
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
the
head
also
seemed
to
run
away
too
quickly
still
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
stout
but
the
bottled
version
really
stands
out
in
the
crowd
where
the
draught
version
is
just
another
oatmeal
stout
pours
a
dark
almost
black
with
just
a
hint
of
red
color
with
a
small
creamy
tan
head
a
bit
of
vigor
is
required
to
get
much
of
any
head
the
head
settles
to
a
bit
of
lace
that
remains
nicely
the
smell
is
dominantly
of
roasted
chocolate
malts
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
the
taste
is
a
nice
complexity
of
the
roasted
malt
flavors
giving
an
almost
smokey
character
to
the
brew
yet
there
is
just
a
touch
of
hops
for
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
each
taste
finishes
with
a
nice
roasted
flavor
i
would
almost
call
this
a
medium
body
stout
it
really
isnt
heavy
at
all
very
pleasant
interesting
and
drinkable
my
favorite
magic
hat
to
date
though
i
hear
good
thinks
about
blind
faith
not
my
favorite
stout
but
a
good
one
we
all
need
to
get
in
touch
with
the
dark
side
sometimes
drink
enough
of
these
and
the
eye
on
the
label
starts
to
follow
you
around
the
room
i
was
eagerly
anticipating
this
and
while
it
was
very
easy
drinking
it
seemed
to
lack
the
weight
of
some
of
the
better
stouts
ive
had
pours
a
charcoal
black
with
a
little
tan
head
nose
is
soft
and
small
some
java
tones
and
some
cocoa
body
is
thin
for
a
stout
maybe
medium
at
best
lets
call
it
on
the
thin
side
of
medium
taste
has
some
coffee
notes
and
dark
cocoa
notes
but
overall
it
isnt
a
powerhouse
of
flavor
finishes
on
a
dry
note
which
is
a
nice
close
overall
this
certainly
isnt
bad
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
this
one
my
first
magic
hat
experience
rates
slightly
above
average
it
was
two
dollar
pint
night
and
i
spied
this
on
tap
poured
a
nice
dark
color
a
pretty
good
head
smooth
a
taint
sweet
and
just
a
hint
of
coffee
it
went
down
quickly
leading
me
to
question
is
it
a
stout
maybe
a
substout
bordering
on
a
porter
regardless
this
was
an
excellent
beer
overall
a
very
respectable
stout
one
of
the
best
that
i
regularly
have
the
pleasure
of
drinking
color
is
fully
black
with
a
big
tan
head
aroma
is
full
of
all
of
the
things
i
enjoy
and
expect
from
any
stout
worth
its
salt
rich
roasty
espresso
notes
mouthfeel
is
full
sweet
rich
with
loads
of
beautiful
sweet
notes
and
bitter
ones
too
tasty
toasty
roasty
with
a
long
luscious
finish
a
fine
and
tasty
stout
with
a
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
and
just
a
touch
syrupy
an
excellent
but
ordinary
stout
and
i
give
up
props
to
unclejimbo
and
purplehops
my
twin
eastcoast
providers
though
i
may
suggest
that
joseph
conrad
might
have
something
more
sinister
in
mind
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissolves
yet
never
completely
disappears
predominantly
smells
of
coffee
with
hints
of
chocolate
there
is
a
definite
roasted
flavour
here
as
well
as
smoked
malts
and
coffee
as
mentioned
above
though
certainly
not
light
much
easier
going
down
than
would
appear
not
nearly
as
heavy
as
other
stouts
overall
one
hell
of
a
stout
and
one
hell
of
a
beer
in
general
my
favourite
in
the
magic
hat
family
wow
a
lot
of
people
have
reviewed
this
beer
in
the
past
few
days
opaque
black
with
ruby
edges
head
was
small
but
did
not
vanish
appealing
aroma
of
roasted
barley
chocolate
coffee
grasses
sharp
tasting
like
many
of
mhs
brews
with
a
bold
assertive
flavor
that
informs
the
drinker
hey
we
are
not
dicking
around
here
roastiness
takes
a
while
to
settle
in
very
warming
and
invigorating
some
light
smokiness
in
the
background
a
little
bit
of
greasiness
too
but
not
repugnant
hops
are
grassy
drying
and
refresingly
bitter
a
perfect
balance
between
bitter
and
sweet
other
reviews
have
talked
about
creaminess
but
im
not
getting
it
i
would
say
this
is
a
bit
slick
for
a
stout
maybe
even
a
little
thin
stickiness
is
appropriate
and
delightful
each
sip
requires
another
a
very
drinkable
beer
an
exquisite
beer
for
a
snowy
winters
day
this
is
just
like
the
conrad
novel
dark
really
dark
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
smell
was
the
best
part
of
the
beer
because
it
reminded
me
of
one
of
my
favorite
things
to
do
take
a
big
whif
from
a
bag
of
freshly
ground
coffee
there
were
also
some
smells
that
made
it
smell
a
little
like
damp
earth
too
excellent
smell
the
taste
had
little
hints
but
wasnt
quite
as
good
but
the
thickness
made
up
for
that
magic
hat
has
a
winner
here
true
to
the
darkness
claim
but
had
a
small
shortlived
head
after
a
few
seconds
the
top
of
the
beer
looked
strangely
like
an
oil
slick
decent
aroma
mostly
made
up
of
roasted
and
burnt
malts
and
a
wee
bit
of
oatmeal
the
flavor
is
too
onedimensional
for
me
and
too
much
black
patent
bitterness
it
seems
to
start
very
similar
to
how
it
finishes
with
little
change
in
between
i
prefer
more
complexity
in
my
oatmeal
stouts
but
being
magic
hat
the
brewers
were
probably
going
for
a
sessionstyle
oatmeal
stout
and
for
that
it
is
fine
an
average
beer
in
my
book
heart
of
darkness
thanks
to
kunzbrew
for
sample
a
black
beer
with
some
red
glow
while
backlit
the
aroma
is
huge
lots
of
chocolateroasted
grain
and
raisins
in
this
tan
foam
the
flavors
are
of
espressoand
bitter
chocolate
that
lingers
on
when
the
glass
is
set
down
unfortunately
the
body
is
too
thin
and
flavor
too
dry
to
get
the
maximum
flavor
out
of
the
ingredients
a
little
more
sweetness
and
the
body
filled
out
and
this
one
could
stand
out
but
until
then
a
thank
you
goes
out
to
mike
kunzbrew
for
sending
me
this
one
in
a
beer
trade
not
a
bad
brew
from
magic
hat
i
might
put
this
into
my
beer
purchasing
rotation
under
the
less
frequent
this
beer
poured
with
a
tight
tan
head
over
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlighted
liquid
very
nice
aromas
of
coffee
and
chocolate
over
a
background
of
roasty
grains
the
taste
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
department
with
flavors
of
highly
roasted
malts
not
much
in
the
way
of
sweetness
or
oatmealy
smoothness
a
nice
level
of
hoppiness
mixes
with
the
roasted
grains
to
lend
a
very
sufficient
and
enjoyable
bitterness
to
the
mix
things
finish
up
on
a
dry
and
roasty
note

the
price

its
a
very
nice
tasty

easy
to
drink
in
quantity
pours
an
almost
jet
black
with
garnet
highlights
and
comes
with
a
nice
tan
twofinger
head
the
aromas
of
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
are
dominant
and
make
your
mouth
water
holy
kamoly
or
however
you
spell
it
this
stuff
is
smooth
and
mirrors
the
aromas
along
with
perfectly
blended
hops
to
make
one
great
tasting
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
yet
finishes
just
slightly
thinner
and
with
a
burnt
chocolate
flavor
very
good
brew
thanks
to
bigdeb
for
sending
me
this
brew
cheers
overall
a
nice
blend
of
flavors
but
nothing
really
special
imho
it
could
use
a
richer
and
thicker
body
and
a
little
more
aroma
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
at
the
same
time
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
one
mint
i
got
a
free
magic
hat
pint
glass
with
the
six
pack
of
this
favorite
brew
of
mine
pours
our
black
as
black
can
be
tastes
oh
so
good
not
quite
as
nice
as
on
tap
but
i
wont
complain
because
this
is
just
such
a
great
beer
thank
you
magic
hat
heart
of
darkness
poured
out
a
solid
black
with
great
carbonation
and
appearance
the
aroma
for
me
was
coffee
and
chocolateand
maybe
a
bit
of
smoke
the
first
sip
was
all
smoke
and
coffee
in
flavor
starting
to
leave
trails
of
lace
with
each
sip
kind
of
an
oil
like
mouthfeel
not
much
carbonation
in
the
actual
mouthfeel
an
earthypeatsmokeand
coffee
taste
the
texture
seemed
a
bit
watery
for
a
stout
overall
very
good
but
not
great
imo
an
easy
drinking
stout
very
typical
of
the
style
i
was
a
little
dissapointed
i
was
hoping
the
magic
hat
people
would
do
something
special
with
this
one
special
thanks
to
pbrian
for
sending
this
on
my
way
thumbs
up
to
bigdeb
for
this
sample
nice
one
deb
this
truely
captures
the
essence
of
a
stout
this
brew
was
black
as
the
night
with
a
small
creamy
tannish
head
belgian
lace
left
its
mark
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
pint
glass
roasted
barley
and
a
sweet
carmel
chocolate
smell
extremely
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
full
bodied
the
way
a
stout
should
be
almost
black
very
very
very
dark
red
pretty
head
of
big
bubbles
and
some
bulges
made
up
of
leaner
bubbles
both
tan
in
color
decorated
the
top
of
this
beer
funky
lace
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
coffee
and
some
fruitiness
from
hops
maybe
raspberrylike
make
up
the
nose
of
this
elegant
stout
tasted
of
nicely
toasted
grains
and
either
wood
or
nuts
i
havent
made
up
my
mind
some
charcoal
flavor
exists
as
one
would
expect
but
it
doesnt
add
much
bitterness
as
is
often
the
case
a
tiny
sourness
pops
up
every
now
and
then
just
adding
to
the
complexity
of
the
brew
extremely
creamy
in
the
mouth
overall
very
good
stout
a
nice
change
from
overly
assertive
stouts
mike
ahhh
the
heart

of
my

will

and
exceptionally
creamy
this
brew
is
definitely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
full
flavored
stouts
out
there
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
from
magic
hat
this
is
one
first
class
brew
thanks
to
bierman9
for
the
sample
a
fine
stout
by
a
fine
brewery
magic
hat
seems
to
be
a
pretty
good
brewer
of
beers
i
am
a
fan
of
a
few
of
their
beers
and
this
one
is
the
best
it
is
dark
coffee
flavored
and
simply
delicious
just
like
a
fine
woman
let
me
first
say
that
i
love
stouts
they
are
my
favorite
style
of
beer
so
i
might
be
somewhat
biased
anyway
i
think
very
highly
of
magic
hats
creamy
stout
it
is
nearly
black
with
a
nice
short
brown
head
very
strong
coffee
and
chocolate
tastes
not
the
best
stout
out
there
ie
sammy
smith
oatmeal
stout
but
definitely
a
great
beer
this
stout
has
a
thick
black
full
body
and
a
slow
forming
creamy
tan
head
strong
roasted
and
some
chocolate
aroma
introduce
a
smooth
roasted
dark
malty
flavor
that
is
not
too
sweet
but
not
at
all
bitter
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
brew
this
almost
black
beer
throws
a
small
brown
head
with
little
retention
not
a
lot
on
the
nose
maybe
some
slight
roasted
tones
nice
creamy
velvety
mouthfeel
the
tastes
in
this
stout
are
pretty
subdued
nothing
overwhelming
the
body
is
light
to
medium
thin
for
a
stout
some
of
the
slight
tastes
i
pick
up
are
sweet
chocolate
and
java
there
is
a
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
not
much
before
that
a
pretty
average
stout
in
my
opinion
nice
looking
brew
deep
rubyblack
with
a
nice
thick
tan
head
the
smell
is
throwing
me
off
allergies
maybe
it
smells
like
a
glass
of
milk
odd
taste
is
better
though
with
roasted
coffee
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
a
creaminess
that
makes
the
beer
feel
warm
and
rich
finish
is
also
creamy
and
slightly
bitter
if
not
for
the
funky
smell
this
would
be
a
topnotch
stout
and
to
be
honest
ill
put
up
with
the
funky
smell
and
will
drink
this
again
dry
complex
and
damn
tasty
a
real
nice
stout
this
is
simply
the
finest
stout
made
in
new
england
beutiful
roasted
coffee
aroma
starts
off
a
little
sweet
but
finishes
crisp
and
dry
very
drinkable
inky
black
with
a
great
dark
roasted
coffee
flavour
i
love
this
beer
the
only
bad
thing
i
can
say
about
it
is
that
its
not
a
year
round
